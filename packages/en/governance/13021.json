  "content": "A COMPILATION OF THE MESSAGES AND PAPERS OF THE PRESIDENTS\r\n\r\nBY JAMES D. RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRutherford B. Hayes\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1877, to March 4, 1881\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRutherford B. Hayes\r\n\r\n\r\nRutherford B. Hayes was born in Delaware: Ohio, October 4, 1822.\r\nHis father had died in July, 1822, leaving his mother in modest\r\ncircumstances. He attended the common schools, and began early the\r\nstudy of Latin and Greek with Judge Sherman Finch, of Delaware.\r\nPrepared for college at an academy at Norwalk, Ohio, and at a school\r\nin Middletown, Conn. In the autumn of 1838 entered Kenyon College,\r\nat Gambier, Ohio. Excelled in logic, mental and moral philosophy,\r\nand mathematics, and also made his mark as a debater in the literary\r\nsocieties. On his graduation, in August, 1842, was awarded the\r\nvaledictory oration, with which he won much praise. Soon afterwards\r\nbegan the study of law in the office of Thomas Sparrow, at Columbus,\r\nOhio, and then attended a course of law lectures at Harvard\r\nUniversity, entering the law school August 22, 1843, and finishing his\r\nstudies there in January, 1845. As a law student he had the advantage\r\nof friendly intercourse with Judge Story and Professor Greenleaf, and\r\nalso attended the lectures of Longfellow on literature and of Agassiz\r\non natural science, pursuing at the same time the study of French and\r\nGerman. In May, 1845, was admitted to practice in the courts of Ohio\r\nas an attorney and counselor at law. Established himself first at\r\nLower Sandusky (now Fremont), where in April, 1846, he formed a law\r\npartnership with Ralph P. Buckland, then a Member of Congress. In the\r\nwinter of 1849-50 established himself at Cincinnati. His practice at\r\nfirst being light, continued his studies in law and literature, and\r\nalso became identified with various literary societies, among them\r\nthe literary club of Cincinnati, where he met Salmon P. Chase, Thomas\r\nEwing, Thomas Corwin, Stanley Matthews, Moncure D. Conway, Manning F.\r\nForce, and others of note. December 30, 1852, married Miss Lucy Ware\r\nWebb, daughter of Dr. James Webb, a physician of Chillicothe, Ohio. In\r\nJanuary, 1854, formed a law partnership with H.W. Corwine and William\r\nK. Rogers. In 1856 was nominated for the office of common pleas judge,\r\nbut declined. In 1858 was elected city solicitor by the city council\r\nof Cincinnati to fill a vacancy, and in the following year was\r\nelected to the same office at a popular election, but was defeated\r\nfor reelection in 1861. After becoming a voter he acted with the Whig\r\nparty, voting for Henry Clay in 1844, for General Taylor in 1848, and\r\nfor General Scott in 1852. Having from his youth cherished antislavery\r\nfeelings, he joined the Republican party as soon as it was organized,\r\nand earnestly advocated the election of Frémont in 1856 and of Lincoln\r\nin 1860. At a great mass meeting held in Cincinnati immediately\r\nafter the firing on Fort Sumter was made chairman of a committee on\r\nresolutions. His literary club formed a military company, of which he\r\nwas elected captain. June 7, 1861, was appointed by the governor of\r\nOhio major of the Twenty-third Ohio Volunteers. September 19, 1861,\r\nwas appointed by General Rosecrans judge-advocate of the Department\r\nof the Ohio. October 24, 1861, was promoted to the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel. In the battle of South Mountain, September 14,\r\n1862, distinguished himself by gallant conduct in leading a charge and\r\nin holding a position at the head of his troops after being severely\r\nwounded in his left arm. October 24, 1862, was appointed colonel\r\nof the Twenty-third Ohio. In July, 1863, while with the army in\r\nsouthwestern Virginia, caused an expedition of two regiments and a\r\nsection of artillery under his command to be dispatched to Ohio for\r\nthe purpose of checking the raid of the Confederate general John\r\nMorgan, and aided materially in preventing the raiders from recrossing\r\nthe Ohio River and in compelling Morgan to surrender. In the spring\r\nof 1864 commanded a brigade in General Crook's expedition to cut the\r\nprincipal lines of communication between Richmond and the Southwest.\r\nDistinguished himself by conspicuous bravery at the head of his\r\nbrigade in storming a fortified position on the crest of Cloyd\r\nMountain. Commanded a brigade in the first battle of Winchester. Took\r\na creditable part in the engagement at Berryville, and at the second\r\nbattle of Winchester, September 19, 1864, performed a feat of great\r\nbravery. Leading an assault upon a battery on an eminence, he found in\r\nhis way a morass over 50 yards wide. Being at the head of his brigade,\r\nhe plunged in first, and, his horse becoming mired at once, he\r\ndismounted and waded across alone under the enemy's fire. Signaled his\r\nmen to come over, and when about 40 had joined him he rushed upon the\r\nbattery and captured it after a hand-to-hand fight. At Fishers Hill,\r\nSeptember 22, 1864, being then in command of a division, executed a\r\nbrilliant flank movement over mountains and through woods, took many\r\npieces of artillery, and routed the enemy. At the battle of Cedar\r\nCreek, October 19, 1864, his conduct attracted so much attention that\r\nhis commander, General Crook, commended him, saying, \"Colonel, from\r\nthis day you will be a brigadier-general.\" The commission reached him\r\na few days afterwards. March 13, 1865, received the rank of brevet\r\nmajor-general \"for gallant and distinguished services during the\r\ncampaign of 1864 in West Virginia, and particularly at the battles of\r\nFishers Hill and Cedar Creek, Virginia.\" In August, 1864, while in the\r\nfield, was nominated for Congress and elected. After the war, returned\r\nto civil life, and took his seat in Congress December 4, 1865. Voted\r\nwith his party on questions connected with the reconstruction of the\r\nSouthern States; supported a resolution declaring the sacredness of\r\nthe public debt and denouncing repudiation, and also one commending\r\nPresident Johnson for declining to accept presents and condemning the\r\npractice; opposed a resolution favoring an increase of pay of members\r\nof Congress; introduced in a Republican caucus resolutions declaring\r\nthat the only mode of obtaining from the States lately in rebellion\r\nirreversible guaranties was by constitutional amendment, and that\r\nan amendment basing representation upon voters instead of population\r\nought to be acted upon without delay. In August, 1866, was renominated\r\nfor Congress by acclamation, and was reelected. Supported the\r\nimpeachment of President Johnson. In June, 1867, was nominated for\r\ngovernor of Ohio, and at the election defeated Judge Allen G. Thurman.\r\nIn June, 1869, was again nominated for governor, and at the election\r\ndefeated George H. Pendleton. At the expiration of his term as\r\ngovernor declined to be a candidate for the United States Senate\r\nagainst John Sherman. In 1872 was again nominated for Congress, but at\r\nthe election was defeated. Declined the office of assistant treasurer\r\nof the United States at Cincinnati. In 1873 established his home at\r\nFremont with the intention of retiring from public life. In 1875 was\r\nagain nominated for governor of Ohio, and at the election defeated\r\nWilliam Allen. Was nominated for President of the United States at\r\nthe national Republican convention at Cincinnati on June 16, 1876. The\r\nDemocrats selected as their candidate Samuel J. Tilden, of New York.\r\nThe result of the election became the subject of acrimonious dispute.\r\nEach party charged fraud upon the other, and both parties claimed to\r\nhave carried the States of Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida.\r\nTo avoid a deadlock, which might have happened if the canvass of\r\nthe electoral votes had been left to the two Houses of Congress\r\n(the Senate having a Republican and the House of Representatives a\r\nDemocratic majority), an act, advocated by members of both parties,\r\nwas passed to refer all contested cases to a commission composed of\r\nfive Senators, five Representatives, and five Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt, the decision of this commission to be final unless set aside\r\nby a concurrent vote of the two Houses of Congress. The commission,\r\nrefusing to go behind the certificates of the governors, decided in\r\neach contested case by a vote of 8 to 7 in favor of the Republican\r\nelectors, beginning with Florida on February 7, and on March 2 Mr.\r\nHayes was declared duly elected President of the United States. Was\r\ninaugurated March 5, 1877. At the expiration of his term returned to\r\nhis home at Fremont, Ohio. Was the recipient of various distinctions.\r\nThe degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by Kenyon College, Harvard\r\nUniversity, Yale College, and Johns Hopkins University. Was made\r\nsenior vice-commander of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion,\r\ncommander of the Ohio commandery of the same order, first president\r\nof the Society of the Army of West Virginia, and president of the\r\nTwenty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteers Association. Was president of\r\nthe trustees of the John F. Slater education fund; one of the trustees\r\nof the Peabody education fund; president of the National Prison\r\nReform Association; an active member of the National Conference\r\nof Corrections and Charities; a trustee of the Western Reserve\r\nUniversity, at Cleveland, Ohio, of the Wesleyan University, of\r\nDelaware, Ohio, of Mount Union College, at Alliance, Ohio, and of the\r\nOhio State University. He died at Fremont, Ohio, January 17, 1893, and\r\nwas buried there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: We have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial,\r\nbegun by Washington, observed by all my predecessors, and now a\r\ntime-honored custom, which marks the commencement of a new term of\r\nthe Presidential office. Called to the duties of this great trust,\r\nI proceed, in compliance with usage, to announce some of the leading\r\nprinciples, on the subjects that now chiefly engage the public\r\nattention, by which it is my desire to be guided in the discharge of\r\nthose duties. I shall not undertake to lay down irrevocably principles\r\nor measures of administration, but rather to speak of the motives\r\nwhich should animate us, and to suggest certain important ends to\r\nbe attained in accordance with our institutions and essential to the\r\nwelfare of our country.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the discussions which preceded the recent\r\nPresidential election it seemed to me fitting that I should fully make\r\nknown my sentiments in regard to several of the important questions\r\nwhich then appeared to demand the consideration of the country.\r\nFollowing the example, and in part adopting the language, of one of my\r\npredecessors, I wish now, when every motive for misrepresentation has\r\npassed away, to repeat what was said before the election, trusting\r\nthat my countrymen will candidly weigh and understand it, and that\r\nthey will feel assured that the sentiments declared in accepting the\r\nnomination for the Presidency will be the standard of my conduct in\r\nthe path before me, charged, as I now am, with the grave and difficult\r\ntask of carrying them out in the practical administration of the\r\nGovernment so far as depends, under the Constitution and laws, on the\r\nChief Executive of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and\r\nby such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its\r\ncitizens in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is\r\nnow the one subject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and\r\npatriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance.\r\n\r\nMany of the calamitous effects of the tremendous revolution which\r\nhas passed over the Southern States still remain. The immeasurable\r\nbenefits which will surely follow, sooner or later, the hearty and\r\ngenerous acceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have\r\nnot yet been realized. Difficult and embarrassing questions meet us\r\nat the threshold of this subject. The people of those States are\r\nstill impoverished, and the inestimable blessing of wise, honest,\r\nand peaceful local self-government is not fully enjoyed. Whatever\r\ndifference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of\r\nthings, the fact is clear that in the progress of events the time has\r\ncome when such government is the imperative necessity required by all\r\nthe varied interests, public and private, of those States. But it must\r\nnot be forgotten that only a local government which recognizes and\r\nmaintains inviolate the rights of all is a true self-government.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to\r\neach other have brought upon us the deplorable complications and\r\nperplexities which exist in those States, it must be a government\r\nwhich guards the interests of both races carefully and equally.\r\nIt must be a government which submits loyally and heartily to the\r\nConstitution and the laws--the laws of the nation and the laws of\r\nthe States themselves--accepting and obeying faithfully the whole\r\nConstitution as it is.\r\n\r\nResting upon this sure and substantial foundation, the superstructure\r\nof beneficent local governments can be built up, and not otherwise.\r\nIn furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the\r\nConstitution, and in behalf of all that its attainment implies, all\r\nso-called party interests lose their apparent importance, and party\r\nlines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance. The question\r\nwe have to consider for the immediate welfare of those States of the\r\nUnion is the question of government or no government; of social order\r\nand all the peaceful industries and the happiness that belong to it,\r\nor a return to barbarism. It is a question in which every citizen of\r\nthe nation is deeply interested, and with respect to which we ought\r\nnot to be, in a partisan sense, either Republicans or Democrats, but\r\nfellow-citizens and fellow-men, to whom the interests of a common\r\ncountry and a common humanity are dear.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion\r\nof our country and the advance of 4,000,000 people from a condition\r\nof servitude to that of citizenship, upon an equal footing with their\r\nformer masters, could not occur without presenting problems of the\r\ngravest moment, to be dealt with by the emancipated race, by their\r\nformer masters, and by the General Government, the author of the\r\nact of emancipation. That it was a wise, just, and providential\r\nact, fraught with good for all concerned, is now generally conceded\r\nthroughout the country. That a moral obligation rests upon the\r\nNational Government to employ its constitutional power and influence\r\nto establish the rights of the people it has emancipated, and to\r\nprotect them in the enjoyment of those rights when they are infringed\r\nor assailed, is also generally admitted.\r\n\r\nThe evils which afflict the Southern States can only be removed or\r\nremedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races, actuated\r\nby motives of mutual sympathy and regard; and while in duty bound and\r\nfully determined to protect the rights of all by every constitutional\r\nmeans at the disposal of my Administration, I am sincerely anxious to\r\nuse every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient\r\nlocal _self_-government as the true resource of those States for the\r\npromotion of the contentment and prosperity of their citizens. In\r\nthe effort I shall make to accomplish this purpose I ask the cordial\r\ncooperation of all who cherish an interest in the welfare of the\r\ncountry, trusting that party ties and the prejudice of race will be\r\nfreely surrendered in behalf of the great purpose to be accomplished.\r\nIn the important work of restoring the South it is not the political\r\nsituation alone that merits attention. The material development\r\nof that section of the country has been arrested by the social and\r\npolitical revolution through which it has passed, and now needs and\r\ndeserves the considerate care of the National Government within the\r\njust limits prescribed by the Constitution and wise public economy.\r\n\r\nBut at the basis of all prosperity, for that as well as for every\r\nother part of the country, lies the improvement of the intellectual\r\nand moral condition of the people. Universal suffrage should rest\r\nupon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent\r\nprovision should be made for the support of free schools by the State\r\ngovernments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from\r\nnational authority.\r\n\r\nLet me assure my countrymen of the Southern States that it is my\r\nearnest desire to regard and promote their truest interests--the\r\ninterests of the white and of the colored people both and equally--and\r\nto put forth my best efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will\r\nforever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the\r\ndistinction between North and South, to the end that we may have not\r\nmerely a united North or a united South, but a united country.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform\r\nin our civil service--a reform not merely as to certain abuses and\r\npractices of so-called official patronage which have come to have the\r\nsanction of usage in the several Departments of our Government, but\r\na change in the system of appointment itself; a reform that shall\r\nbe thorough, radical, and complete; a return to the principles and\r\npractices of the founders of the Government. They neither expected\r\nnor desired from public officers any partisan service. They meant that\r\npublic officers should owe their whole service to the Government and\r\nto the people. They meant that the officer should be secure in his\r\ntenure as long as his personal character remained untarnished and the\r\nperformance of his duties satisfactory. They held that appointments to\r\noffice were not to be made nor expected merely as rewards for partisan\r\nservices, nor merely on the nomination of members of Congress, as\r\nbeing entitled in any respect to the control of such appointments.\r\n\r\nThe fact that both the great political parties of the country, in\r\ndeclaring their principles prior to the election, gave a prominent\r\nplace to the subject of reform of our civil service, recognizing and\r\nstrongly urging its necessity, in terms almost identical in their\r\nspecific import with those I have here employed, must be accepted as\r\na conclusive argument in behalf of these measures. It must be regarded\r\nas the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country\r\nupon this subject, and both political parties are virtually pledged\r\nto give it their unreserved support.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States of necessity owes his election to\r\noffice to the suffrage and zealous labors of a political party,\r\nthe members of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential\r\nimportance the principles of their party organization; but he should\r\nstrive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best\r\nwho serves the country best.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the reform we seek, and in other important respects\r\na change of great importance, I recommend an amendment to the\r\nConstitution prescribing a term of six years for the Presidential\r\noffice and forbidding a reelection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the financial condition of the country, I shall not\r\nattempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which\r\nwe have suffered during the past three years. The depression in all\r\nour varied commercial and manufacturing interests throughout the\r\ncountry, which began in September, 1873, still continues. It is very\r\ngratifying, however, to be able to say that there are indications all\r\naround us of a coming change to prosperous times.\r\n\r\nUpon the currency question, intimately connected, as it is, with this\r\ntopic, I may be permitted to repeat here the statement made in my\r\nletter of acceptance, that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty\r\ninseparable from an irredeemable paper currency, with its fluctuation\r\nof values, is one of the greatest obstacles to a return to prosperous\r\ntimes. The only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin\r\nbasis and is at all times and promptly convertible into coin.\r\n\r\nI adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of\r\nCongressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie\r\npayments, and I am satisfied not only that this is wise, but that\r\nthe interests, as well as the public sentiment, of the country\r\nimperatively demand it.\r\n\r\nPassing from these remarks upon the condition of our own country\r\nto consider our relations with other lands, we are reminded by the\r\ninternational complications abroad, threatening the peace of Europe,\r\nthat our traditional rule of noninterference in the affairs of foreign\r\nnations has proved of great value in past times and ought to be\r\nstrictly observed.\r\n\r\nThe policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor, President Grant, of\r\nsubmitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves\r\nand foreign powers points to a new, and incomparably the best,\r\ninstrumentality for the preservation of peace, and will, as I believe,\r\nbecome a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar\r\nemergencies by other nations.\r\n\r\nIf, unhappily, questions of difference should at any time during the\r\nperiod of my Administration arise between the United States and any\r\nforeign government, it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to\r\naid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way, thus\r\nsecuring to our country the great blessings of peace and mutual good\r\noffices with all the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we have reached the close of a political contest\r\nmarked by the excitement which usually attends the contests between\r\ngreat political parties whose members espouse and advocate with\r\nearnest faith their respective creeds. The circumstances were,\r\nperhaps, in no respect extraordinary save in the closeness and the\r\nconsequent uncertainty of the result.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed\r\nbest, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, that the\r\nobjections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of\r\nthe electoral votes should be referred to the decision of a tribunal\r\nappointed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThat tribunal--established by law for this sole purpose; its members,\r\nall of them, men of long-established reputation for integrity and\r\nintelligence, and, with the exception of those who are also members of\r\nthe supreme judiciary, chosen equally from both political parties; its\r\ndeliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able\r\ncounsel--was entitled to the fullest confidence of the American\r\npeople. Its decisions have been patiently waited for, and accepted\r\nas legally conclusive by the general judgment of the public. For the\r\npresent, opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several\r\nconclusions announced by that tribunal. This is to be anticipated\r\nin every instance where matters of dispute are made the subject of\r\narbitration under the forms of law. Human judgment is never unerring,\r\nand is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful\r\nparty in the contest.\r\n\r\nThe fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a\r\ndispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the\r\nlaw no less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the\r\nquestion in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing.\r\n\r\nUpon one point there is entire unanimity in public sentiment--that\r\nconflicting claims to the Presidency must be amicably and peaceably\r\nadjusted, and that when so adjusted the general acquiescence of the\r\nnation ought surely to follow.\r\n\r\nIt has been reserved for a government of the people, where the right\r\nof suffrage is universal, to give to the world the first example in\r\nhistory of a great nation, in the midst of the struggle of opposing\r\nparties for power, hushing its party tumults to yield the issue of\r\nthe contest to adjustment according to the forms of law.\r\n\r\nLooking for the guidance of that Divine Hand by which the destinies\r\nof nations and individuals are shaped, I call upon you, Senators,\r\nRepresentatives, judges, fellow-citizens, here and everywhere, to\r\nunite with me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the\r\nblessings, not only of material prosperity, but of justice, peace, and\r\nunion--a union depending not upon the constraint of force, but upon\r\nthe loving devotion of a free people; \"and that all things may be\r\nso ordered and settled upon the best and surest foundations that\r\npeace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety, may be\r\nestablished among us for all generations.\"\r\n\r\nMARCH 5, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the final adjournment of the Forty-fourth Congress without\r\nmaking the usual appropriations for the support of the Army for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1878, presents an extraordinary occasion\r\nrequiring the President to exercise the power vested in him by the\r\nConstitution to convene the Houses of Congress in anticipation of the\r\nday fixed by law for their next meeting:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, do, by virtue of the power to this end in me vested by the\r\nConstitution, convene both Houses of Congress to assemble at their\r\nrespective chambers at 12 o'clock noon on Monday, the 15th day of\r\nOctober next, then and there to consider and determine such measures\r\nas in their wisdom their duty and the welfare of the people may seem\r\nto demand.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 5th day of May, A.D. 1877, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WM. M. EVARTS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided in the Constitution of the United States\r\nthat the United States shall protect every State in this Union,\r\non application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the\r\nlegislature can not be convened), against domestic violence; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the governor of the State of West Virginia has represented\r\nthat domestic violence exists in said State at Martinsburg, and at\r\nvarious other points along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad\r\nin said State, which the authorities of said State are unable to\r\nsuppress; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States require that in all cases of\r\ninsurrection in any State or of obstruction to the laws thereof,\r\nwhenever it may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, he\r\nshall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse\r\nand retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, do hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States and\r\nall persons within the territory and jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates against aiding, countenancing, abetting, or taking part in such\r\nunlawful proceedings; and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or\r\nconnected with said domestic violence and obstruction of the laws to\r\ndisperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before\r\n12 o'clock noon of the 19th day of July instant.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 18th day of July, A.D. 1877, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred\r\nand second.\r\n\r\nR.B.

I concur with the\r\ncommission in their recommendations. It is my wish that the collection\r\nof the revenues should be free from partisan control, and organized on\r\na strictly business basis, with the same guaranties for efficiency and\r\nfidelity in the selection of the chief and subordinate officers that\r\nwould be required by a prudent merchant. Party leaders should have\r\nno more influence in appointments than other equally respectable\r\ncitizens. No assessments for political purposes on officers or\r\nsubordinates should be allowed. No useless officer or employee should\r\nbe retained. No officer should be required or permitted to take part\r\nin the management of political organizations, caucuses, conventions,\r\nor election campaigns. Their right to vote and to express their\r\nviews on public questions, either orally or through the press, is not\r\ndenied, provided it does not interfere with the discharge of their\r\nofficial duties.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nR.B.

Their right to vote and to express\r\n  their views on public questions, either orally or through the\r\n  press, is not denied, provided it does not interfere with\r\n  the discharge of their official duties. No assessment for\r\n  political purposes on officers or subordinates should be\r\n  allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rule is applicable to every department of the civil service. It\r\nshould be understood by every officer of the General Government that\r\nhe is expected to conform his conduct to its requirements.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nR.B.

No trader to any other\r\n  tribe shall, so long as such prohibition may continue, trade\r\n  with any Indians of or for the tribe against which such\r\n  prohibition is issued--\r\n\r\n\r\nthe introduction into the Indian country, for the purpose of sale or\r\nexchange to or with Indians, of any breech-loading firearms, and of\r\nany special ammunition adapted to such arms, and the sale and exchange\r\nto Indians in the Indian country of any such arms or ammunition, is\r\nhereby prohibited; and it is hereby directed that all authority under\r\nany license to trade in such arms or ammunition is hereby revoked.\r\n\r\nThe introduction into the country or district occupied by any tribe of\r\nhostile Indians, for the purpose of sale or exchange to them, of arms\r\nor ammunition of any description, and the sale or exchange thereof to\r\nor with such Indians, is hereby prohibited; and it is hereby directed\r\nthat all license to trade in arms or ammunition of any description\r\nwith such tribe be revoked.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of section 2150, Revised Statutes, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The military forces of the United States may be employed in\r\n  such manner and under such regulations as the President may\r\n  direct--\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Third.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See pp. 398-399.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _October 15, 1877._\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe adjournment of the last Congress without making appropriations\r\nfor the support of the Army for the present fiscal year has rendered\r\nnecessary a suspension of payments to the officers and men of the sums\r\ndue them for services rendered after the 30th day of June last.\r\nThe Army exists by virtue of statutes which prescribe its numbers,\r\nregulate its organization and employment, and which fix the pay of its\r\nofficers and men and declare their right to receive the same at stated\r\nperiods. These statutes, however, do not authorize the payment of\r\nthe troops in the absence of specific appropriations therefor. The\r\nConstitution has wisely provided that \"no money shall be drawn from\r\nthe Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law;\" and\r\nit has also been declared by statute that \"no department of the\r\nGovernment shall expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess\r\nof appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year.\" We have,\r\ntherefore, an Army in service, authorized by law and entitled to be\r\npaid, but no funds available for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt may also be said, as an additional incentive to prompt action by\r\nCongress, that since the commencement of the fiscal year the Army,\r\nthough without pay, has been constantly and actively employed in\r\narduous and dangerous service, in the performance of which both\r\nofficers and men have discharged their duty with fidelity and\r\ncourage and without complaint. These circumstances, in my judgment,\r\nconstituted an extraordinary occasion requiring that Congress be\r\nconvened in advance of the time prescribed by law for your meeting in\r\nregular session. The importance of speedy action upon this subject\r\non the part of Congress is so manifest that I venture to suggest the\r\npropriety of making the necessary appropriations for the support\r\nof the Army for the current year at its present maximum numerical\r\nstrength of 25,000 men, leaving for future consideration all questions\r\nrelating to an increase or decrease of the number of enlisted men.\r\nIn the event of the reduction of the Army by subsequent legislation\r\nduring the fiscal year, the excess of the appropriation could not\r\nbe expended; and in the event of its enlargement the additional sum\r\nrequired for the payment of the extra force could be provided in due\r\ntime. It would be unjust to the troops now in service, and whose pay\r\nis already largely in arrears, if payment to them should be further\r\npostponed until after Congress shall have considered all the questions\r\nlikely to arise in the effort to fix the proper limit to the strength\r\nof the Army.\r\n\r\nEstimates of appropriations for the support of the military\r\nestablishment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, were\r\ntransmitted to Congress by the former Secretary of the Treasury at the\r\nopening of its session in December last. These estimates, modified by\r\nthe present Secretary so as to conform to present requirements, are\r\nnow renewed, amounting to $32,436,764.98, and, having been transmitted\r\nto both Houses of Congress, are submitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is also required by the Navy Department $2,003,861.24. This sum\r\nis made up of $1,446,688.16 due to officers and enlisted men for the\r\nlast quarter of the last fiscal year; $311,953.50 due for advances\r\nmade by the fiscal agent of the Government in London for the support\r\nof the foreign service; $50,000 due to the naval-hospital fund;\r\n$150,000 due for arrearages of pay to officers, and $45,219.58 for the\r\nsupport of the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\nThere will also be needed an appropriation of $262,535.22 to defray\r\nthe unsettled expenses of the United States courts for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30 last, now due to attorneys, clerks, commissioners, and\r\nmarshals, and for rent of court rooms, the support of prisoners, and\r\nother deficiencies.\r\n\r\nA part of the building of the Interior Department was destroyed by\r\nfire on the 24th of last month. Some immediate repairs and temporary\r\nstructures have in consequence become necessary, estimates for which\r\nwill be transmitted to Congress immediately, and an appropriation of\r\nthe requisite funds is respectfully recommended.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will communicate to Congress, in\r\nconnection with the estimates for the appropriations for the support\r\nof the Army for the current fiscal year, estimates for such other\r\ndeficiencies in the different branches of the public service as\r\nrequire immediate action and can not without inconvenience be\r\npostponed until the regular session.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity also to invite your attention to the propriety\r\nof adopting at your present session the necessary legislation\r\nto enable the people of the United States to participate in the\r\nadvantages of the International Exhibition of Agriculture, Industry,\r\nand the Fine Arts which is to be held at Paris in 1878, and in which\r\nthis Government has been invited by the Government of France to take\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThis invitation was communicated to this Government in May, 1876,\r\nby the minister of France at this capital, and a copy thereof was\r\nsubmitted to the proper committees of Congress at its last session,\r\nbut no action was taken upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State has received many letters from various parts\r\nof the country expressing a desire to participate in the exhibition,\r\nand numerous applications of a similar nature have also been made at\r\nthe United States legation at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State has also received official advice of the\r\nstrong desire on the part of the French Government that the United\r\nStates should participate in this enterprise, and space has hitherto\r\nbeen and still is reserved in the exhibition buildings for the use of\r\nexhibitors from the United States, to the exclusion of other parties\r\nwho have been applicants therefor.\r\n\r\nIn order that our industries may be properly represented at the\r\nexhibition, an appropriation will be needed for the payment of\r\nsalaries and expenses of commissioners, for the transportation of\r\ngoods, and for other purposes in connection with the object in view;\r\nand as May next is the time fixed for the opening of the exhibition,\r\nif our citizens are to share the advantages of this international\r\ncompetition for the trade of other nations the necessity of immediate\r\naction is apparent.\r\n\r\nTo enable the United States to cooperate in the international\r\nexhibition which was held at Vienna in 1873, Congress then passed a\r\njoint resolution making an appropriation of $200,000 and authorizing\r\nthe President to appoint a certain number of practical artisans and\r\nscientific men who should attend the exhibition and report their\r\nproceedings and observations to him. Provision was also made for the\r\nappointment of a number of honorary commissioners.\r\n\r\nI have felt that prompt action by Congress in accepting the invitation\r\nof the Government of France is of so much interest to the people of\r\nthis country and so suitable to the cordial relations between the\r\nGovernments of the two countries that the subject might properly be\r\npresented for attention at your present session.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Sweden and Norway has addressed an official\r\ninvitation to this Government to take part in the International Prison\r\nCongress to be held at Stockholm next year. The problem which the\r\ncongress proposes to study--how to diminish crime--is one in which\r\nall civilized nations have an interest in common, and the congress\r\nof Stockholm seems likely to prove the most important convention ever\r\nheld for the study of this grave question. Under authority of a joint\r\nresolution of Congress approved February 16, 1875, a commissioner was\r\nappointed by my predecessor to represent the United States upon that\r\noccasion, and the Prison Congress having been, at the earnest desire\r\nof the Swedish Government, postponed to 1878, his commission was\r\nrenewed by me. An appropriation of $8,000 was made in the sundry civil\r\nact of 1875 to meet the expenses of the commissioner. I recommend\r\nthe reappropriation of that sum for the same purpose, the former\r\nappropriation having been covered into the Treasury and being no\r\nlonger available for the purpose without further action by Congress.\r\nThe subject is brought to your attention at this time in view of\r\ncircumstances which render it highly desirable that the commissioner\r\nshould proceed to the discharge of his important duties immediately.\r\n\r\nAs the several acts of Congress providing for detailed reports from\r\nthe different Departments of the Government require their submission\r\nat the beginning of the regular annual session, I defer until that\r\ntime any further reference to subjects of public interest.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe completed circle of summer and winter, seedtime and harvest,\r\nhas brought us to the accustomed season at which a religious people\r\ncelebrates with praise and thanksgiving the enduring mercy of Almighty\r\nGod. This devout and public confession of the constant dependence of\r\nman upon the divine favor for all the good gifts of life and health\r\nand peace and happiness, so early in our history made the habit of\r\nour people, finds in the survey of the past year new grounds for its\r\njoyful and grateful manifestation.\r\n\r\nIn all the blessings which depend upon benignant seasons, this has\r\nindeed been a memorable year. Over the wide territory of our country,\r\nwith all its diversity of soil and climate and products, the earth has\r\nyielded a bountiful return to the labor of the husbandman. The\r\nhealth of the people has been blighted by no prevalent or widespread\r\ndiseases. No great disasters of shipwreck upon our coasts or to our\r\ncommerce on the seas have brought loss and hardship to merchants or\r\nmariners and clouded the happiness of the community with sympathetic\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nIn all that concerns our strength and peace and greatness as a nation;\r\nin all that touches the permanence and security of our Government and\r\nthe beneficent institutions on which it rests; in all that affects\r\nthe character and dispositions of our people and tests our capacity\r\nto enjoy and uphold the equal and free condition of society, now\r\npermanent and universal throughout the land, the experience of the\r\nlast year is conspicuously marked by the protecting providence of God\r\nand is full of promise and hope for the coming generations.\r\n\r\nUnder a sense of these infinite obligations to the Great Ruler of\r\nTimes and Seasons and Events, let us humbly ascribe it to our own\r\nfaults and frailties if in any degree that perfect concord and\r\nhappiness, peace and justice, which such great mercies should diffuse\r\nthrough the hearts and lives of our people do not altogether and\r\nalways and everywhere prevail. Let us with one spirit and with one\r\nvoice lift up praise and thanksgiving to God for His manifold goodness\r\nto our land, His manifest care for our nation.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, do appoint Thursday, the 29th day of November next, as a day\r\nof national thanksgiving and prayer; and I earnestly recommend that,\r\nwithdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of\r\nthe United States do meet together on that day in their respective\r\nplaces of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for\r\nHis mercies and to devoutly beseech their continuance.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 29th day of October, A.D.\r\n1877, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WM. M. EVARTS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., November 2, 1877_.\r\n\r\nI lament the sad occasion which makes it my duty to testify the public\r\nrespect for the eminent citizen and distinguished statesman whose\r\ndeath yesterday at his home in Indianapolis has been made known to the\r\npeople by telegraphic announcement.\r\n\r\nThe services of Oliver P. Morton to the nation in the difficult and\r\nresponsible administration of the affairs of the State of Indiana\r\nas its governor at a critical juncture of the civil war can never be\r\novervalued by his countrymen. His long service in the Senate has shown\r\nhis great powers as a legislator and as a leader and chief counselor\r\nof the political party charged with the conduct of the Government\r\nduring that period.\r\n\r\nIn all things and at all times he has been able, strenuous, and\r\nfaithful in the public service, and his fame with his countrymen rests\r\nupon secure foundations.\r\n\r\nThe several Executive Departments will be closed on the day of his\r\nfuneral, and appropriate honors should be paid to the memory of the\r\ndeceased statesman by the whole nation.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 3, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nWith devout gratitude to the bountiful Giver of All Good, I\r\ncongratulate you that at the beginning of your first regular session\r\nyou find our country blessed with health and peace and abundant\r\nharvests, and with encouraging prospects of an early return of general\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nTo complete and make permanent the pacification of the country\r\ncontinues to be, and until it is fully accomplished must remain, the\r\nmost important of all our national interests. The earnest purpose of\r\ngood citizens generally to unite their efforts in this endeavor is\r\nevident. It found decided expression in the resolutions announced in\r\n1876 by the national conventions of the leading political parties of\r\nthe country. There was a widespread apprehension that the momentous\r\nresults in our progress as a nation marked by the recent amendments\r\nto the Constitution were in imminent jeopardy; that the good\r\nunderstanding which prompted their adoption, in the interest of a\r\nloyal devotion to the general welfare, might prove a barren truce, and\r\nthat the two sections of the country, once engaged in civil strife,\r\nmight be again almost as widely severed and disunited as they were\r\nwhen arrayed in arms against each other.\r\n\r\nThe course to be pursued, which, in my judgment, seemed wisest in\r\nthe presence of this emergency, was plainly indicated in my inaugural\r\naddress. It pointed to the time, which all our people desire to see,\r\nwhen a genuine love of our whole country and of all that concerns\r\nits true welfare shall supplant the destructive forces of the mutual\r\nanimosity of races and of sectional hostility. Opinions have differed\r\nwidely as to the measures best calculated to secure this great end.\r\nThis was to be expected. The measures adopted by the Administration\r\nhave been subjected to severe and varied criticism. Any course\r\nwhatever which might have been entered upon would certainly have\r\nencountered distrust and opposition. These measures were, in my\r\njudgment, such as were most in harmony with the Constitution and\r\nwith the genius of our people, and best adapted, under all the\r\ncircumstances, to attain the end in view. Beneficent results, already\r\napparent, prove that these endeavors are not to be regarded as a\r\nmere experiment, and should sustain and encourage us in our efforts.\r\nAlready, in the brief period which has elapsed, the immediate\r\neffectiveness, no less than the justice, of the course pursued is\r\ndemonstrated, and I have an abiding faith that time will furnish\r\nits ample vindication in the minds of the great majority of my\r\nfellow-citizens. The discontinuance of the use of the Army for the\r\npurpose of upholding local governments in two States of the Union was\r\nno less a constitutional duty and requirement, under the circumstances\r\nexisting at the time, than it was a much-needed measure for the\r\nrestoration of local self-government and the promotion of national\r\nharmony. The withdrawal of the troops from such employment was\r\neffected deliberately, and with solicitous care for the peace and good\r\norder of society and the protection of the property and persons and\r\nevery right of all classes of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe results that have followed are indeed significant and encouraging.\r\nAll apprehension of danger from remitting those States to local\r\nself-government is dispelled, and a most salutary change in the minds\r\nof the people has begun and is in progress in every part of that\r\nsection of the country once the theater of unhappy civil strife,\r\nsubstituting for suspicion, distrust, and aversion, concord,\r\nfriendship, and patriotic attachment to the Union. No unprejudiced\r\nmind will deny that the terrible and often fatal collisions which for\r\nseveral years have been of frequent occurrence and have agitated and\r\nalarmed the public mind have almost entirely ceased, and that a spirit\r\nof mutual forbearance and hearty national interest has succeeded.\r\nThere has been a general reestablishment of order and of the orderly\r\nadministration of justice. Instances of remaining lawlessness have\r\nbecome of rare occurrence; political turmoil and turbulence have\r\ndisappeared; useful industries have been resumed; public credit in\r\nthe Southern States has been greatly strengthened, and the encouraging\r\nbenefits of a revival of commerce between the sections of the country\r\nlately embroiled in civil war are fully enjoyed. Such are some of\r\nthe results already attained, upon which the country is to be\r\ncongratulated. They are of such importance that we may with confidence\r\npatiently await the desired consummation that will surely come with\r\nthe natural progress of events.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper here to say that it should be our fixed and\r\nunalterable determination to protect by all available and proper means\r\nunder the Constitution and the laws the lately emancipated race in\r\nthe enjoyment of their rights and privileges; and I urge upon those\r\nto whom heretofore the colored people have sustained the relation of\r\nbondmen the wisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation\r\nwith respect to their education and general welfare. A firm adherence\r\nto the laws, both national and State, as to the civil and political\r\nrights of the colored people, now advanced to full and equal\r\ncitizenship; the immediate repression and sure punishment by the\r\nnational and local authorities, within their respective jurisdictions,\r\nof every instance of lawlessness and violence toward them, is required\r\nfor the security alike of both races, and is justly demanded by the\r\npublic opinion of the country and the age. In this way the restoration\r\nof harmony and good will and the complete protection of every citizen\r\nin the full enjoyment of every constitutional right will surely be\r\nattained. Whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not\r\nhesitate to put forth.\r\n\r\nWhatever belongs to the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourts of the Union, they may confidently be relied upon to provide\r\nand perform; and to the legislatures, the courts, and the executive\r\nauthorities of the several States I earnestly appeal to secure, by\r\nadequate, appropriate, and seasonable means, within their borders,\r\nthese common and uniform rights of a united people which loves\r\nliberty, abhors oppression, and reveres justice. These objects are\r\nvery dear to my heart. I shall continue most earnestly to strive\r\nfor their attainment. The cordial cooperation of all classes, of\r\nall sections of the country and of both races, is required for this\r\npurpose; and with these blessings assured, and not otherwise, we\r\nmay safely hope to hand down our free institutions of government\r\nunimpaired to the generations that will succeed us.\r\n\r\nAmong the other subjects of great and general importance to the people\r\nof this country, I can not be mistaken, I think, in regarding as\r\npreeminent the policy and measures which are designed to secure the\r\nrestoration of the currency to that normal and healthful condition in\r\nwhich, by the resumption of specie payments, our internal trade\r\nand foreign commerce may be brought into harmony with the system of\r\nexchanges which is based upon the precious metals as the intrinsic\r\nmoney of the world. In the public judgment that this end should be\r\nsought and compassed as speedily and securely as the resources of the\r\npeople and the wisdom of their Government can accomplish, there is\r\na much greater degree of unanimity than is found to concur in the\r\nspecific measures which will bring the country to this desired end or\r\nthe rapidity of the steps by which it can be safely reached.\r\n\r\nUpon a most anxious and deliberate examination, which I have felt it\r\nmy duty to give to the subject, I am but the more confirmed in\r\nthe opinion which I expressed in accepting the nomination for the\r\nPresidency, and again upon my inauguration, that the policy of\r\nresumption should be pursued by every suitable means, and that no\r\nlegislation would be wise that should disparage the importance or\r\nretard the attainment of that result. I have no disposition, and\r\ncertainly no right, to question the sincerity or the intelligence\r\nof opposing opinions, and would neither conceal nor undervalue the\r\nconsiderable difficulties, and even occasional distresses, which may\r\nattend the progress of the nation toward this primary condition to its\r\ngeneral and permanent prosperity. I must, however, adhere to my most\r\nearnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or unsteadiness\r\nin methods, so far from avoiding or reducing the inconvenience\r\ninseparable from the transition from an irredeemable to a redeemable\r\npaper currency, would only tend to increased and prolonged disturbance\r\nin values, and unless retrieved must end in serious disorder,\r\ndishonor, and disaster in the financial affairs of the Government and\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe mischiefs which I apprehend and urgently deprecate are confined\r\nto no class of the people, indeed, but seem to me most certainly to\r\nthreaten the industrious masses, whether their occupations are of\r\nskilled or common labor. To them, it seems to me, it is of prime\r\nimportance that their labor should be compensated in money which is\r\nitself fixed in exchangeable value by being irrevocably measured by\r\nthe labor necessary to its production. This permanent quality of\r\nthe money of the people is sought for, and can only be gained by\r\nthe resumption of specie payments. The rich, the speculative, the\r\noperating, the money-dealing classes may not always feel the mischiefs\r\nof, or may find casual profits in, a variable currency, but the\r\nmisfortunes of such a currency to those who are paid salaries or wages\r\nare inevitable and remediless.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this general subject of the resumption of\r\nspecie payments is one of subordinate, but still of grave, importance;\r\nI mean the readjustment of our coinage system by the renewal of\r\nthe silver dollar as an element in our specie currency, endowed by\r\nlegislation with the quality of legal tender to a greater or less\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nAs there is no doubt of the power of Congress under the Constitution\r\n\"to coin money and regulate the value thereof,\" and as this power\r\ncovers the whole range of authority applicable to the metal, the\r\nrated, value and the legal-tender quality which shall be adopted for\r\nthe coinage, the considerations which should induce or discourage a\r\nparticular measure connected with the coinage, belong clearly to the\r\nprovince of legislative discretion and of public expediency. Without\r\nintruding upon this province of legislation in the least, I have\r\nyet thought the subject of such critical importance, in the actual\r\ncondition of our affairs, as to present an occasion for the\r\nexercise of the duty imposed by the Constitution on the President of\r\nrecommending to the consideration of Congress \"such measures as he\r\nshall judge necessary and expedient.\"\r\n\r\nHolding the opinion, as I do, that neither the interests of the\r\nGovernment nor of the people of the United States would be promoted by\r\ndisparaging silver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the\r\ncoinage of the world, and that legislation which looks to maintaining\r\nthe volume of intrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as\r\ntheir relative commercial values will permit would be neither unjust\r\nnor inexpedient, I must ask your indulgence to a brief and definite\r\nstatement of certain essential features in any such legislative\r\nmeasure which I feel it my duty to recommend.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter the debate, represented on both sides by\r\nsuch able disputants in Congress and before the people and in the\r\npress, as to the extent to which the legislation of any one nation\r\ncan control this question, even within its own borders, against the\r\nunwritten laws of trade or the positive laws of other governments. The\r\nwisdom of Congress in shaping any particular law that may be presented\r\nfor my approval may wholly supersede the necessity of my entering into\r\nthese considerations, and I willingly avoid either vague or intricate\r\ninquiries. It is only certain plain and practical traits of such\r\nlegislation that I desire to recommend to your attention.\r\n\r\nIn any legislation providing for a silver coinage, regulating its\r\nvalue, and imparting to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to me\r\nof great importance that Congress should not lose sight of its action\r\nas operating in a twofold capacity and in two distinct directions.\r\nIf the United States Government were free from a public debt, its\r\nlegislative dealing with the question of silver coinage would be\r\npurely sovereign and governmental, under no restraints but those of\r\nconstitutional power and the public good as affected by the proposed\r\nlegislation. But in the actual circumstances of the nation, with a\r\nvast public debt distributed very widely among our own citizens and\r\nheld in great amounts also abroad, the nature of the silver-coinage\r\nmeasure, as affecting this relation of the Government to the holders\r\nof the public debt, becomes an element, in any proposed legislation,\r\nof the highest concern. The obligation of the public faith\r\ntranscends all questions of profit or public advantage otherwise.\r\nIts unquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest\r\nexpediency as of the most necessary duty, and will ever be carefully\r\nguarded by Congress and people alike.\r\n\r\nThe public debt of the United States to the amount of $729,000,000\r\nbears interest at the rate of 6 per cent, and $708,000,000 at the rate\r\nof 5 per cent, and the only way in which the country can be relieved\r\nfrom the payment of these high rates of interest is by advantageously\r\nrefunding the indebtedness. Whether the debt is ultimately paid in\r\ngold or in silver coin is of but little moment compared with the\r\npossible reduction of interest one-third by refunding it at such\r\nreduced rate. If the United States had the unquestioned right to pay\r\nits bonds in silver coin, the little benefit from that process would\r\nbe greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect of such payment\r\nif made or proposed against the honest convictions of the public\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nAll the bonds that have been issued since February 12, 1873, when\r\ngold became the only unlimited legal-tender metallic currency of the\r\ncountry, are justly payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value.\r\nDuring the time of these issues the only dollar that could be or was\r\nreceived by the Government in exchange for bonds was the gold dollar.\r\nTo require the public creditors to take in repayment any dollar of\r\nless commercial value would be regarded by them as a repudiation\r\nof the full obligation assumed. The bonds issued prior to 1873 were\r\nissued at a time when the gold dollar was the only coin in circulation\r\nor contemplated by either the Government or the holders of the bonds\r\nas the coin in which they were to be paid. It is far better to\r\npay these bonds in that coin than to seem to take advantage of the\r\nunforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a new issue of silver coin\r\nthus made so much less valuable. The power of the United States\r\nto coin money and to regulate the value thereof ought never to be\r\nexercised for the purpose of enabling the Government to pay its\r\nobligations in a coin of less value than that contemplated by the\r\nparties when the bonds were issued. Any attempt to pay the national\r\nindebtedness in a coinage of less commercial value than the money\r\nof the world would involve a violation of the public faith and work\r\nirreparable injury to the public credit.\r\n\r\nIt was the great merit of the act of March, 1869, in strengthening\r\nthe public credit, that it removed all doubt as to the purpose of the\r\nUnited States to pay their bonded debt in coin. That act was accepted\r\nas a pledge of public faith. The Government has derived great benefit\r\nfrom it in the progress thus far made in refunding the public debt at\r\nlow rates of interest. An adherence to the wise and just policy of\r\nan exact observance of the public faith will enable the Government\r\nrapidly to reduce the burden of interest on the national debt to an\r\namount exceeding $20,000,000 per annum, and effect an aggregate saving\r\nto the United States of more than $300,000,000 before the bonds can be\r\nfully paid.\r\n\r\nIn adapting the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of currency in\r\nthe everyday transactions of life and prescribing the quality of legal\r\ntender to be assigned to it, a consideration of the first importance\r\nshould be so to adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold\r\ncoinage, which now constitutes our specie currency, as to accomplish\r\nthe desired end of maintaining the circulation of the two metallic\r\ncurrencies and keeping up the volume of the two precious metals as our\r\nintrinsic money. It is a mixed question, for scientific reasoning\r\nand historical experience to determine, how far and by what methods a\r\npractical equilibrium can be maintained which will keep both metals in\r\ncirculation in their appropriate spheres of common use.\r\n\r\nAn absolute equality of commercial value, free from disturbing\r\nfluctuations, is hardly attainable, and without it an unlimited\r\nlegal tender for private transactions assigned to both metals would\r\nirresistibly tend to drive out of circulation the dearer coinage and\r\ndisappoint the principal object proposed by the legislation in view.\r\nI apprehend, therefore, that the two conditions of a near approach to\r\nequality of commercial value between the gold and silver coinage of\r\nthe same denomination and of a limitation of the amounts for which the\r\nsilver coinage is to be a legal tender are essential to maintaining\r\nboth in circulation. If these conditions can be successfully observed,\r\nthe issue from the mint of silver dollars would afford material\r\nassistance to the community in the transition to redeemable paper\r\nmoney, and would facilitate the resumption of specie payment and its\r\npermanent establishment. Without these conditions I fear that only\r\nmischief and misfortune would flow from a coinage of silver\r\ndollars with the quality of unlimited legal tender, even in private\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nAny expectation of temporary ease from an issue of silver coinage to\r\npass as a legal tender at a rate materially above its commercial value\r\nis, I am persuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think that there is any\r\nsubstantial distinction between an original issue of silver dollars\r\nat a nominal value materially above their commercial value and the\r\nrestoration of the silver dollar at a rate which once was, but has\r\nceased to be, its commercial value. Certainly the issue of our gold\r\ncoinage, reduced in weight materially below its legal-tender value,\r\nwould not be any the less a present debasement of the coinage by\r\nreason of its equaling, or even exceeding, in weight a gold\r\ncoinage which at some past time had been commercially equal to the\r\nlegal-tender value assigned to the new issue.\r\n\r\nIn recommending that the regulation of any silver coinage which may be\r\nauthorized by Congress should observe these conditions of commercial\r\nvalue and limited legal tender, I am governed by the feeling that\r\nevery possible increase should be given to the volume of metallic\r\nmoney which can be kept in circulation, and thereby every possible aid\r\nafforded to the people in the process of resuming specie payments. It\r\nis because of my firm conviction that a disregard of these conditions\r\nwould frustrate the good results which are desired from the proposed\r\ncoinage, and embarrass with new elements of confusion and uncertainty\r\nthe business of the country, that I urge upon your attention these\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend to Congress that in any legislation providing\r\nfor a silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal tender\r\nthere be impressed upon the measure a firm provision exempting the\r\npublic debt heretofore issued and now outstanding from payment, either\r\nof principal or interest, in any coinage of less commercial value than\r\nthe present gold coinage of the country.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the civil service of the country has for a number\r\nof years attracted more and more of the public attention. So general\r\nhas become the opinion that the methods of admission to it and\r\nthe conditions of remaining in it are unsound that both the great\r\npolitical parties have agreed in the most explicit declarations of the\r\nnecessity of reform and in the most emphatic demands for it. I have\r\nfully believed these declarations and demands to be the expression of\r\na sincere conviction of the intelligent masses of the people upon the\r\nsubject, and that they should be recognized and followed by earnest\r\nand prompt action on the part of the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments of the Government, in pursuance of the purpose indicated.\r\n\r\nBefore my accession to office I endeavored to have my own views\r\ndistinctly understood, and upon my inauguration my accord with\r\nthe public opinion was stated in terms believed to be plain and\r\nunambiguous. My experience in the executive duties has strongly\r\nconfirmed the belief in the great advantage the country would find in\r\nobserving strictly the plan of the Constitution, which imposes upon\r\nthe Executive the sole duty and responsibility of the selection of\r\nthose Federal officers who by law are appointed, not elected, and\r\nwhich in like manner assigns to the Senate the complete right to\r\nadvise and consent to or to reject the nominations so made, whilst\r\nthe House of Representatives stands as the public censor of the\r\nperformance of official duties, with the prerogative of investigation\r\nand prosecution in all cases of dereliction. The blemishes and\r\nimperfections in the civil service may, as I think, be traced in most\r\ncases to a practical confusion of the duties assigned to the several\r\nDepartments of the Government. My purpose in this respect has been\r\nto return to the system established by the fundamental law, and to\r\ndo this with the heartiest cooperation and most cordial understanding\r\nwith the Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe practical difficulties in the selection of numerous officers for\r\nposts of widely varying responsibilities and duties are acknowledged\r\nto be very great. No system can be expected to secure absolute freedom\r\nfrom mistakes, and the beginning of any attempted change of custom\r\nis quite likely to be more embarrassed in this respect than any\r\nsubsequent period. It is here that the Constitution seems to me to\r\nprove its claim to the great wisdom accorded to it. It gives to\r\nthe Executive the assistance of the knowledge and experience of the\r\nSenate, which, when acting upon nominations as to which they may be\r\ndisinterested and impartial judges, secures as strong a guaranty of\r\nfreedom from errors of importance as is perhaps possible in human\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, I recognize the public advantage of making all\r\nnominations, as nearly as possible, impersonal, in the sense of being\r\nfree from mere caprice or favor in the selection; and in those offices\r\nin which special training is of greatly increased value I believe such\r\na rule as to the tenure of office should obtain as may induce men of\r\nproper qualifications to apply themselves industriously to the task of\r\nbecoming proficients. Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavored\r\nto reduce the number of changes in subordinate places usually made\r\nupon the change of the general administration, and shall most heartily\r\ncooperate with Congress in the better systematizing of such methods\r\nand rules of admission to the public service and of promotion within\r\nit as may promise to be most successful in making thorough competency,\r\nefficiency, and character the decisive tests in these matters.\r\n\r\nI ask the renewed attention of Congress to what has already been done\r\nby the Civil Service Commission, appointed, in pursuance of an act\r\nof Congress, by my predecessor, to prepare and revise civil-service\r\nrules. In regard to much of the departmental service, especially at\r\nWashington, it may be difficult to organize a better system than\r\nthat which has thus been provided, and it is now being used to a\r\nconsiderable extent under my direction. The Commission has still a\r\nlegal existence, although for several years no appropriation has been\r\nmade for defraying its expenses. Believing that this Commission\r\nhas rendered valuable service and will be a most useful agency in\r\nimproving the administration of the civil service, I respectfully\r\nrecommend that a suitable appropriation, to be immediately available,\r\nbe made to enable it to continue its labors.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to transmit to Congress as early as practicable a\r\nreport by the chairman of the Commission, and to ask your attention\r\nto such measures on this subject as in my opinion will further promote\r\nthe improvement of the civil service.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the United States have continued to maintain\r\npeaceful relations with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war between Russia and Turkey, though at one time\r\nattended by grave apprehension as to its effect upon other European\r\nnations, has had no tendency to disturb the amicable relations\r\nexisting between the United States and each of the two contending\r\npowers. An attitude of just and impartial neutrality has been\r\npreserved, and I am gratified to state that in the midst of their\r\nhostilities both the Russian and the Turkish Governments have shown an\r\nearnest disposition to adhere to the obligations of all treaties with\r\nthe United States and to give due regard to the rights of American\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the treaty defining the rights, immunities, and\r\nprivileges of consuls, between Italy and the United States, ratified\r\nin 1868, either Government may, after the lapse of ten years,\r\nterminate the existence of the treaty by giving twelve months' notice\r\nof its intention. The Government of Italy, availing itself of this\r\nfaculty, has now given the required notice, and the treaty will\r\naccordingly end on the 17th of September, 1878. It is understood,\r\nhowever, that the Italian Government wishes to renew it in its general\r\nscope, desiring only certain modifications in some of its articles.\r\nIn this disposition I concur, and shall hope that no serious obstacles\r\nmay intervene to prevent or delay the negotiation of a satisfactory\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nNumerous questions in regard to passports, naturalization, and\r\nexemption from military service have continued to arise in cases of\r\nemigrants from Germany who have returned to their native country. The\r\nprovisions of the treaty of February 22, 1868, however, have proved to\r\nbe so ample and so judicious that the legation of the United States at\r\nBerlin has been able to adjust all claims arising under it, not only\r\nwithout detriment to the amicable relations existing between the two\r\nGovernments, but, it is believed, without injury or injustice to any\r\nduly naturalized American citizen. It is desirable that the treaty\r\noriginally made with the North German Union in 1868 should now be\r\nextended so as to apply equally to all the States of the Empire of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe invitation of the Government of France to participate in the\r\nExposition of the Products of Agriculture, Industry, and the Fine\r\nArts to be held at Paris during the coming year was submitted for\r\nyour consideration at the extra session. It is not doubted that its\r\nacceptance by the United States, and a well-selected exhibition of the\r\nproducts of American industry on that occasion, will tend to stimulate\r\ninternational commerce and emigration, as well as to promote the\r\ntraditional friendship between the two countries.\r\n\r\nA question arose some time since as to the proper meaning of the\r\nextradition articles of the treaty of 1842 between the United States\r\nand Great Britain. Both Governments, however, are now in accord in\r\nthe belief that the question is not one that should be allowed to\r\nfrustrate the ends of justice or to disturb the friendship between\r\nthe two nations. No serious difficulty has arisen in accomplishing\r\nthe extradition of criminals when necessary. It is probable that all\r\npoints of disagreement will in due time be settled, and, if need be,\r\nmore explicit declarations be made in a new treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Fishery Commission under Articles XVIII to XXV of the treaty of\r\nWashington has concluded its session at Halifax. The result of the\r\ndeliberations of the commission, as made public by the commissioners,\r\nwill be communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty for the protection of trade-marks has been negotiated\r\nwith Great Britain, which has been submitted to the Senate for its\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which recently occurred in Mexico was followed by the\r\naccession of the successful party to power and the installation of its\r\nchief, General Porfirio Diaz, in the Presidential office. It has been\r\nthe custom of the United States, when such changes of government have\r\nheretofore occurred in Mexico, to recognize and enter into official\r\nrelations with the _de facto_ government as soon as it should appear\r\nto have the approval of the Mexican people and should manifest a\r\ndisposition to adhere to the obligations of treaties and international\r\nfriendship. In the present case such official recognition has been\r\ndeferred by the occurrences on the Rio Grande border, the records\r\nof which have been already communicated to each House of Congress in\r\nanswer to their respective resolutions of inquiry. Assurances\r\nhave been received that the authorities at the seat of the Mexican\r\nGovernment have both the disposition and the power to prevent and\r\npunish such unlawful invasions and depredations. It is earnestly to be\r\nhoped that events may prove these assurances to be well founded. The\r\nbest interests of both countries require the maintenance of peace upon\r\nthe border and the development of commerce between the two Republics.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to add that this temporary interruption of official\r\nrelations has not prevented due attention by the representatives of\r\nthe United States in Mexico to the protection of American citizens, so\r\nfar as practicable; nor has it interfered with the prompt payment of\r\nthe amounts due from Mexico to the United States under the treaty of\r\nJuly 4, 1868, and the awards of the joint commission. While I do not\r\nanticipate an interruption of friendly relations with Mexico, yet I\r\ncan not but look with some solicitude upon a continuance of border\r\ndisorders as exposing the two countries to initiations of popular\r\nfeeling and mischances of action which are naturally unfavorable to\r\ncomplete amity. Firmly determined that nothing shall be wanting on my\r\npart to promote a good understanding between the two nations, I yet\r\nmust ask the attention of Congress to the actual occurrences on the\r\nborder, that the lives and property of our citizens may be adequately\r\nprotected and peace preserved.\r\n\r\nAnother year has passed without bringing to a close the protracted\r\ncontest between the Spanish Government and the insurrection in the\r\nisland of Cuba. While the United States have sedulously abstained from\r\nany intervention in this contest, it is impossible not to feel that\r\nit is attended with incidents affecting the rights and interests of\r\nAmerican citizens. Apart from the effect of the hostilities upon\r\ntrade between the United States and Cuba, their progress is inevitably\r\naccompanied by complaints, having more or less foundation, of\r\nsearches, arrests, embargoes, and oppressive taxes upon the property\r\nof American residents, and of unprovoked interference with American\r\nvessels and commerce. It is due to the Government of Spain to say that\r\nduring the past year it has promptly disavowed and offered reparation\r\nfor any unauthorized acts of unduly zealous subordinates whenever\r\nsuch acts have been brought to its attention. Nevertheless, such\r\noccurrences can not but tend to excite feelings of annoyance,\r\nsuspicion, and resentment, which are greatly to be deprecated, between\r\nthe respective subjects and citizens of two friendly powers.\r\n\r\nMuch delay (consequent upon accusations of fraud in some of the\r\nawards) has occurred in respect to the distribution of the limited\r\namounts received from Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866,\r\napplicable to the awards of the joint commission created by that\r\ntreaty. So long as these matters are pending in Congress the Executive\r\ncan not assume either to pass upon the questions presented or to\r\ndistribute the fund received. It is eminently desirable that definite\r\nlegislative action should be taken, either affirming the awards to be\r\nfinal or providing some method for reexamination of the claims. Our\r\nrelations with the Republics of Central and South America and with the\r\nEmpire of Brazil have continued without serious change, further than\r\nthe temporary interruption of diplomatic intercourse with Venezuela\r\nand with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already been fully\r\nrestored with Venezuela, and it is not doubted that all grounds of\r\nmisunderstanding with Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all\r\nthese countries there are favorable indications of a disposition on\r\nthe part of their Governments and people to reciprocate our efforts in\r\nthe direction of increased commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Samoan Islands has sent an envoy, in the person\r\nof its secretary of state, to invite the Government of the United\r\nStates to recognize and protect their independence, to establish\r\ncommercial relations with their people, and to assist them in their\r\nsteps toward regulated and responsible government. The inhabitants\r\nof these islands, having made considerable progress in Christian\r\ncivilization and the development of trade, are doubtful of their\r\nability to maintain peace and independence without the aid of some\r\nstronger power. The subject is deemed worthy of respectful attention,\r\nand the claims upon our assistance by this distant community will be\r\ncarefully considered.\r\n\r\nThe long commercial depression in the United States has directed\r\nattention to the subject of the possible increase of our foreign trade\r\nand the methods for its development, not only with Europe, but with\r\nother countries, and especially with the States and sovereignties of\r\nthe Western Hemisphere. Instructions from the Department of State\r\nwere issued to the various diplomatic and consular officers of the\r\nGovernment, asking them to devote attention to the question of methods\r\nby which trade between the respective countries of their official\r\nresidence and the United States could be most judiciously fostered.\r\nIn obedience to these instructions, examinations and reports upon this\r\nsubject have been made by many of these officers and transmitted to\r\nthe Department, and the same are submitted to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the state of the\r\nfinances presents important questions for the action of Congress, upon\r\nsome of which I have already remarked.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Government during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1877, were $269,000,586.62; the total expenditures for the same period\r\nwere $238,660,008.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69.\r\nThis has substantially supplied the requirements of the sinking fund\r\nfor that year. The estimated revenues of the current fiscal year are\r\n$265,500,000, and the estimated expenditures for the same period are\r\n$232,430,643.72. If these estimates prove to be correct, there will be\r\na surplus revenue of $33,069,356.28--an amount nearly sufficient for\r\nthe sinking fund for that year. The estimated revenues for the next\r\nfiscal year are $269,250,000. It appears from the report that during\r\nthe last fiscal year the revenues of the Government, compared with the\r\nprevious year, have largely decreased. This decrease, amounting to the\r\nsum of $18,481,452.54, was mainly in customs duties, caused partly\r\nby a large falling off of the amount of imported dutiable goods and\r\npartly by the general fall of prices in the markets of production of\r\nsuch articles as pay _ad valorem_ taxes.\r\n\r\nWhile this is felt injuriously in the diminution of the revenue, it\r\nhas been accompanied with a very large increase of exportations. The\r\ntotal exports during the last fiscal year, including coin, have\r\nbeen $658,637,457, and the imports have been $492,097,540, leaving a\r\nbalance of trade in favor of the United States amounting to the sum of\r\n$166,539,917, the beneficial effects of which extend to all branches\r\nof business.\r\n\r\nThe estimated revenue for the next fiscal year will impose upon\r\nCongress the duty of strictly limiting appropriations, including the\r\nrequisite sum for the maintenance of the sinking fund, within the\r\naggregate estimated receipts.\r\n\r\nWhile the aggregate of taxes should not be increased, amendments\r\nmight be made to the revenue laws that would, without diminishing the\r\nrevenue, relieve the people from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tea and\r\ncoffee is shown by the experience not only of our own country, but\r\nof other countries, to be easily collected, without loss by\r\nundervaluation or fraud, and largely borne in the country of\r\nproduction. A tax of 10 cents a pound on tea and 2 cents a pound on\r\ncoffee would produce a revenue exceeding $12,000,000, and thus enable\r\nCongress to repeal a multitude of annoying taxes yielding a revenue\r\nnot exceeding that sum. The internal-revenue system grew out of the\r\nnecessities of the war, and most of the legislation imposing taxes\r\nupon domestic products under this system has been repealed. By the\r\nsubstitution of a tax on tea and coffee all forms of internal taxation\r\nmay be repealed, except that on whisky, spirits, tobacco, and beer.\r\nAttention is also called to the necessity of enacting more vigorous\r\nlaws for the protection of the revenue and for the punishment of\r\nfrauds and smuggling. This can best be done by judicious provisions\r\nthat will induce the disclosure of attempted fraud by undervaluation\r\nand smuggling. All revenue laws should be simple in their provisions\r\nand easily understood. So far as practicable, the rates of taxation\r\nshould be in the form of specific duties, and not _ad valorem_,\r\nrequiring the judgment of experienced men to ascertain values and\r\nexposing the revenue to the temptation of fraud.\r\n\r\nMy attention has been called during the recess of Congress to abuses\r\nexisting in the collection of the customs, and strenuous efforts\r\nhave been made for their correction by Executive orders. The\r\nrecommendations submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury by a\r\ncommission appointed to examine into the collection of customs duties\r\nat the port of New York contain many suggestions for the modification\r\nof the customs laws, to which the attention of Congress is invited.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of congratulation that notwithstanding the severe\r\nburdens caused by the war the public faith with all creditors has been\r\npreserved, and that as the result of this policy the public credit has\r\ncontinuously advanced and our public securities are regarded with the\r\nhighest favor in the markets of the world. I trust that no act of the\r\nGovernment will cast a shadow upon its credit.\r\n\r\nThe progress of refunding the public debt has been rapid and\r\nsatisfactory. Under the contract existing when I entered upon the\r\ndischarge of the duties of my office, bonds bearing interest at the\r\nrate of 4-1/2 per cent were being rapidly sold, and within three\r\nmonths the aggregate sales of these bonds had reached the sum of\r\n$200,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary of the Treasury entered\r\ninto a new contract for the sale of 4 per cent bonds, and within\r\nthirty days after the popular subscription for such bonds was opened\r\nsubscriptions were had amounting to $75,496,550, which were paid for\r\nwithin ninety days after the date of subscription. By this process,\r\nwithin but little more than one year, the annual interest on the\r\npublic debt was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.\r\n\r\nI recommended that suitable provision be made to enable the people to\r\neasily convert their savings into Government securities, as the best\r\nmode in which small savings may be well secured and yield a moderate\r\ninterest. It is an object of public policy to retain among our own\r\npeople the securities of the United States. In this way our country is\r\nguarded against their sudden return from foreign countries, caused by\r\nwar or other disturbances beyond our limits.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States with foreign nations, and especially\r\nthe export of domestic productions, has of late years largely\r\nincreased; but the greater portion of this trade is conducted in\r\nforeign vessels. The importance of enlarging our foreign trade, and\r\nespecially by direct and speedy interchange with countries on this\r\ncontinent, can not be overestimated; and it is a matter of great\r\nmoment that our own shipping interest should receive, to the utmost\r\npractical extent, the benefit of our commerce with other lands. These\r\nconsiderations are forcibly urged by all the large commercial cities\r\nof the country, and public attention is generally and wisely attracted\r\nto the solution of the problems they present. It is not doubted that\r\nCongress will take them up in the broadest spirit of liberality\r\nand respond to the public demand by practical legislation upon this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been\r\nactively employed during the year, and has rendered very important\r\nservice in suppressing hostilities in the Indian country and in\r\npreserving peace and protecting life and property in the interior as\r\nwell as along the Mexican border. A long and arduous campaign has been\r\nprosecuted, with final complete success, against a portion of the Nez\r\nPercé tribe of Indians. A full account of this campaign will be found\r\nin the report of the General of the Army. It will be seen that in\r\nits course several severe battles were fought, in which a number of\r\ngallant officers and men lost their lives. I join with the Secretary\r\nof War and the General of the Army in awarding to the officers and men\r\nemployed in the long and toilsome pursuit and in the final capture of\r\nthese Indians the honor and praise which are so justly their due.\r\n\r\nThe very serious riots which occurred in several of the States in July\r\nlast rendered necessary the employment of a considerable portion of\r\nthe Army to preserve the peace and maintain order. In the States of\r\nWest Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Illinois these disturbances\r\nwere so formidable as to defy the local and State authorities, and\r\nthe National Executive was called upon, in the mode provided by the\r\nConstitution and laws, to furnish military aid. I am gratified to be\r\nable to state that the troops sent in response to these calls for aid\r\nin the suppression of domestic violence were able, by the influence\r\nof their presence in the disturbed regions, to preserve the peace\r\nand restore order without the use of force. In the discharge of this\r\ndelicate and important duty both officers and men acted with great\r\nprudence and courage, and for their services deserve the thanks of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nDisturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to which I have already\r\nreferred, have rendered necessary the constant employment of a\r\nmilitary force in that vicinity. A full report of all recent military\r\noperations in that quarter has been transmitted to the House of\r\nRepresentatives in answer to a resolution of that body, and it will\r\ntherefore not be necessary to enter into details. I regret to say that\r\nthese lawless incursions into our territory by armed bands from the\r\nMexican side of the line, for the purpose of robbery, have been of\r\nfrequent occurrence, and in spite of the most vigilant efforts of\r\nthe commander of our forces the marauders have generally succeeded in\r\nescaping into Mexico with their plunder. In May last I gave orders for\r\nthe exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of our troops for the\r\nsuppression of these raids and the punishment of the guilty parties,\r\nas well as the recapture of property stolen by them. General Ord,\r\ncommanding in Texas, was directed to invite the cooperation of the\r\nMexican authorities in efforts to this end, and to assure them that I\r\nwas anxious to avoid giving the least offense to Mexico. At the same\r\ntime, he was directed to give notice of my determination to put an\r\nend to the invasion of our territory by lawless bands intent upon the\r\nplunder of our peaceful citizens, even if the effectual punishment of\r\nthe outlaws should make the crossing of the border by our troops in\r\ntheir pursuit necessary. It is believed that this policy has had\r\nthe effect to check somewhat these depredations, and that with\r\na considerable increase of our force upon that frontier and the\r\nestablishment of several additional military posts along the Rio\r\nGrande, so as more effectually to guard that extensive border, peace\r\nmay be preserved and the lives and property of our citizens in Texas\r\nfully protected.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 1st day of July last the Army was, in accordance with\r\nlaw, reduced to the maximum of 25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction\r\nof 2,500 below the force previously authorized. This reduction was\r\nmade, as required by law, entirely from the infantry and artillery\r\nbranches of the service, without any reduction of the cavalry. Under\r\nthe law as it now stands it is necessary that the cavalry regiments\r\nbe recruited to 100 men in each company for service on the Mexican\r\nand Indian frontiers. The necessary effect of this legislation is to\r\nreduce the infantry and artillery arms of the service below the number\r\nrequired for efficiency, and I concur with the Secretary of War in\r\nrecommending that authority be given to recruit all companies of\r\ninfantry to at least 50 men and all batteries of artillery to at least\r\n75 men, with the power, in case of emergency, to increase the former\r\nto 100 and the latter to 122 men each.\r\n\r\nI invite your special attention to the following recommendations of\r\nthe Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nFirst. That provision be made for supplying to the Army a more\r\nabundant and better supply of reading matter.\r\n\r\nSecond. That early action be taken by Congress looking to a complete\r\nrevision and republication of the Army Regulations.\r\n\r\nThird. That section 1258 of the Revised Statutes, limiting the number\r\nof officers on the retired list, be repealed.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the claims arising under the act of July 4, 1864, for\r\nsupplies taken by the Army during the war, be taken from the offices\r\nof the Quartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the\r\nSouthern Claims Commission, or some other tribunal having more time\r\nand better facilities for their prompt investigation and decision than\r\nare possessed by these officers.\r\n\r\nFifth. That Congress provide for an annuity fund for the families\r\nof deceased soldiers, as recommended by the Paymaster-General of the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that we have six\r\nsquadrons now engaged in the protection of our foreign commerce\r\nand other duties pertaining to the naval service. The condition and\r\noperations of the Department are also shown. The total expenditures\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877, were $16,077,974.54. There\r\nare unpaid claims against the Department chargeable to the last year,\r\nwhich are presented to the consideration of Congress by the report of\r\nthe Secretary. The estimates for the fiscal year commencing July 1,\r\n1878, are $16,233,234.40, exclusive of the sum of $2,314,231\r\nsubmitted for new buildings, repairs, and improvements at the several\r\nnavy-yards. The appropriations for the present fiscal year, commencing\r\nJuly 1, 1877, are $13,592,932.90. The amount drawn from the Treasury\r\nfrom July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $5,343,037.40, of which there is\r\nestimated to be yet available $1,029,528.30, showing the amount of\r\nactual expenditure during the first four months of the present fiscal\r\nyear to have been $4,313,509.10.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General contains a full and clear\r\nstatement of the operations and condition of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment. The ordinary revenues of the Department for the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1877, including receipts from the money-order\r\nbusiness and from official stamps and stamped envelopes, amounted\r\nto the sum of $27,531,585.26. The additional sum of $7,013,000 was\r\nrealized from appropriations from the general Treasury for various\r\npurposes, making the receipts from all sources $34,544,885.26. The\r\ntotal expenditures during the fiscal year amounted to $33,486,322.44,\r\nleaving an excess of total receipts over total expenditures of\r\n$1,058,562.82, and an excess of total expenditures over ordinary\r\nreceipts of $5,954,737.18. Deducting from the total receipts the\r\nsum of $63,261.84, received from international money orders of the\r\npreceding fiscal year, and deducting from the total expenditures the\r\nsum of $1,163,818.20, paid on liabilities incurred in previous fiscal\r\nyears, the expenditures and receipts appertaining to the business of\r\nthe last fiscal year were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Expenditures                                        $32,322,504.24\r\n  Receipts (ordinary, from money-order business\r\n    and from official postage stamps)                  27,468,323.42\r\n                                                       _____________\r\n  Excess of expenditures                                4,854,180.82\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues of the Post-Office Department for the year\r\nending June 30, 1879, are estimated at an increase of 3 per cent over\r\nthose of 1877, making $29,034,098.28, and the expenditures for\r\nthe same year are estimated at $36,427,771, leaving an estimated\r\ndeficiency for the year 1879 of $7,393,672.72. The additional\r\nlegislation recommended by the Postmaster-General for improvements of\r\nthe mail service and to protect the postal revenues from the abuses\r\npracticed under existing laws is respectfully commended to the careful\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains several suggestions as to\r\nthe administration of justice, to which I invite your attention.\r\nThe pressure of business in the Supreme Court and in certain circuit\r\ncourts of the United States is now such that serious delays, to the\r\ngreat injury, and even oppression, of suitors, occur, and a remedy\r\nshould be sought for this condition of affairs. Whether it will be\r\nfound in the plan briefly sketched in the report, of increasing the\r\nnumber of judges of the circuit courts, and, by means of this addition\r\nto the judicial force, of creating an intermediate court of errors and\r\nappeals, or whether some other mode can be devised for obviating the\r\ndifficulties which now exist, I leave to your mature consideration.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Indian tribes in the territory of the\r\nUnited States and our relations with them are fully set forth in\r\nthe reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs. After a series of most deplorable conflicts--the\r\nsuccessful termination of which, while reflecting honor upon the\r\nbrave soldiers who accomplished it, can not lessen our regret at their\r\noccurrence--we are now at peace with all the Indian tribes within our\r\nborders. To preserve that peace by a just and humane policy will be\r\nthe object of my earnest endeavors. Whatever may be said of their\r\ncharacter and savage propensities, of the difficulties of introducing\r\namong them the habits of civilized life, and of the obstacles they\r\nhave offered to the progress of settlement and enterprise in certain\r\nparts of the country, the Indians are certainly entitled to our\r\nsympathy and to a conscientious respect on our part for their claims\r\nupon our sense of justice. They were the aboriginal occupants of the\r\nland we now possess. They have been driven from place to place. The\r\npurchase money paid to them in some cases for what they called their\r\nown has still left them poor. In many instances, when they had settled\r\ndown upon land assigned to them by compact and begun to support\r\nthemselves by their own labor, they were rudely jostled off and thrust\r\ninto the wilderness again. Many, if not most, of our Indian wars have\r\nhad their origin in broken promises and acts of injustice upon our\r\npart, and the advance of the Indians in civilization has been slow\r\nbecause the treatment they received did not permit it to be faster\r\nand more general. We can not expect them to improve and to follow our\r\nguidance unless we keep faith with them in respecting the rights they\r\npossess, and unless, instead of depriving them of their opportunities,\r\nwe lend them a helping hand.\r\n\r\nI cordially approve the policy regarding the management of Indian\r\naffairs outlined in the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and\r\nof the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The faithful performance of\r\nour promises is the first condition of a good understanding with the\r\nIndians. I can not too urgently recommend to Congress that prompt and\r\nliberal provision be made for the conscientious fulfillment of all\r\nengagements entered into by the Government with the Indian tribes.\r\nTo withhold the means necessary for the performance of a promise\r\nis always false economy, and is apt to prove disastrous in its\r\nconsequences. Especial care is recommended to provide for Indians\r\nsettled on their reservations cattle and agricultural implements, to\r\naid them in whatever efforts they may make to support themselves, and\r\nby the establishment and maintenance of schools to bring them under\r\nthe control of civilized influences. I see no reason why Indians who\r\ncan give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported\r\ntheir families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach\r\nthemselves from their tribal relations, should not be admitted to the\r\nbenefit of the homestead act and the privileges of citizenship, and\r\nI recommend the passage of a law to that effect. It will be an act\r\nof justice as well as a measure of encouragement. Earnest efforts\r\nare being made to purify the Indian service, so that every dollar\r\nappropriated by Congress shall redound to the benefit of the Indians,\r\nas intended. Those efforts will have my firm support. With an improved\r\nservice and every possible encouragement held out to the Indians\r\nto better their condition and to elevate themselves in the scale of\r\ncivilization, we may hope to accomplish at the same time a good work\r\nfor them and for ourselves.\r\n\r\nI invite the attention of Congress to the importance of the statements\r\nand suggestions made by the Secretary of the Interior concerning the\r\ndepredations committed on the timber lands of the United States and\r\nthe necessity for the preservation of forests. It is believed that\r\nthe measures taken in pursuance of existing laws to arrest those\r\ndepredations will be entirely successful if Congress, by an\r\nappropriation for that purpose, renders their continued enforcement\r\npossible. The experience of other nations teaches us that a country\r\ncan not be stripped of its forests with impunity, and we shall\r\nexpose ourselves to the gravest consequences unless the wasteful\r\nand improvident manner in which the forests in the United States\r\nare destroyed be effectually checked. I earnestly recommend that\r\nthe measures suggested by the Secretary of the Interior for the\r\nsuppression of depredations on the public timber lands of the United\r\nStates, for the selling of timber from the public lands, and for the\r\npreservation of forests be embodied in a law, and that, considering\r\nthe urgent necessity of enabling the people of certain States and\r\nTerritories to purchase timber from the public lands in a legal\r\nmanner, which at present they can not do, such a law be passed without\r\nunavoidable delay. I would also call the attention of Congress to\r\nthe statements made by the Secretary of the Interior concerning the\r\ndisposition that might be made of the desert lands, not irrigable,\r\nwest of the one hundredth meridian. These lands are practically\r\nunsalable under existing laws, and the suggestion is worthy of\r\nconsideration that a system of leasehold tenure would make them\r\na source of profit to the United States, while at the same time\r\nlegalizing the business of cattle raising which is at present carried\r\non upon them.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture contains the gratifying\r\nannouncement of the extraordinary success which has rewarded the\r\nagricultural industry of the country for the past year. With the fair\r\nprices which obtain for the products of the soil, especially for the\r\nsurplus which our people have to export, we may confidently turn to\r\nthis as the most important of all our resources for the revival of the\r\ndepressed industries of the country. The report shows our agricultural\r\nprogress during the year, and contains a statement of the work done\r\nby this Department for the advancement of agricultural industry, upon\r\nwhich the prosperity of our people so largely depends. Matters of\r\ninformation are included of great interest to all who seek, by the\r\nexperience of others, to improve their own methods of cultivation.\r\nThe efforts of the Department to increase the production of important\r\narticles of consumption will, it is hoped, improve the demand for\r\nlabor and advance the business of the country, and eventually result\r\nin saving some of the many millions that are now annually paid to\r\nforeign nations for sugar and other staple products which habitual use\r\nhas made necessary in our domestic everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe board on behalf of the United States Executive Departments at the\r\nInternational Exhibition of 1876 has concluded its labors. The final\r\nreport of the board was transmitted to Congress by the President\r\nnear the close of the last session. As these papers are understood to\r\ncontain interesting and valuable information, and will constitute\r\nthe only report emanating from the Government on the subject of the\r\nexhibition, I invite attention to the matter and recommend that the\r\nreport be published for general information.\r\n\r\nCongress is empowered by the Constitution with the authority of\r\nexclusive legislation over the District of Columbia, in which the seat\r\nof Government of the nation is located. The interests of the District,\r\nhaving no direct representation in Congress, are entitled to especial\r\nconsideration and care at the hands of the General Government. The\r\ncapital of the United States belongs to the nation, and it is natural\r\nthat the American people should take pride in the seat of their\r\nNational Government and desire it to be an ornament to the country.\r\nMuch has been done to render it healthful, convenient, and attractive,\r\nbut much remains to be done, which its permanent inhabitants are not\r\nable and ought not to be expected to do. To impose upon them a large\r\nproportion of the cost required for public improvements, which are\r\nin a great measure planned and executed for the convenience of the\r\nGovernment and of the many thousands of visitors from all parts of\r\nthe country who temporarily reside at the capital of the nation, is an\r\nevident injustice. Special attention is asked by the Commissioners of\r\nthe District in their report, which is herewith transmitted, to the\r\nimportance of a permanent adjustment by Congress of the financial\r\nrelations between the United States and the District, involving\r\nthe regular annual contribution by the United States of its just\r\nproportion of the expenses of the District government and of the\r\noutlay for all needed public improvements, and such measure of\r\nrelief from the burden of taxation now resting upon the people of the\r\nDistrict as in the wisdom of Congress may be deemed just.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners shows that the affairs of the District\r\nare in a condition as satisfactory as could be expected in view of the\r\nheavy burden of debt resting upon it and its very limited means for\r\nnecessary expenses.\r\n\r\nThe debt of the District is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Old funded debt                                         $8,379,691.96\r\n  3.65 bonds, guaranteed by the United States             13,743,250.00\r\n                                                          _____________\r\n  Total bonded debt                                       22,122,941.96\r\n\r\n  To which should be added certain outstanding claims,\r\n    as explained in the report of the Commissioners        1,187,204.52\r\n                                                          _____________\r\n  Making the total debt of the District                   23,310,146.48\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners also ask attention to the importance of the\r\nimprovement of the Potomac River and the reclamation of the marshes\r\nbordering the city of Washington, and their views upon this subject\r\nare concurred in by the members of the board of health, whose report\r\nis also herewith transmitted. Both the commercial and sanitary\r\ninterests of the District will be greatly promoted, I doubt not,\r\nby this improvement.\r\n\r\nYour attention is invited to the suggestion of the Commissioners and\r\nof the board of health for the organization of a board of charities,\r\nto have supervision and control of the disbursement of all moneys for\r\ncharitable purposes from the District treasury. I desire also to ask\r\nyour especial attention to the need of adding to the efficiency of the\r\npublic schools of the District by supplemental aid from the National\r\nTreasury. This is especially just, since so large a number of those\r\nattending these schools are children of employees of the Government.\r\nI earnestly commend to your care the interests of the people of\r\nthe District, who are so intimately associated with the Government\r\nestablishments, and to whose enterprise the good order and\r\nattractiveness of the capital are largely due; and I ask your\r\nattention to the request of the Commissioners for legislation in\r\nbehalf of the interests intrusted to their care. The appropriations\r\nasked for the care of the reservations belonging to the Government\r\nwithin the city, by the Commissioner of Public Buildings and Grounds,\r\nare also commended to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the joint commission created by the act approved 2d of\r\nAugust, 1876, entitled \"An act providing for the completion of the\r\nWashington Monument,\" is also herewith transmitted, with accompanying\r\ndocuments. The board of engineer officers detailed to examine the\r\nmonument, in compliance with the second section of the act, have\r\nreported that the foundation is insufficient. No authority exists for\r\nmaking the expenditure necessary to secure its stability. I therefore\r\nrecommend that the commission be authorized to expend such portion of\r\nthe sum appropriated by the act as may be necessary for the purpose.\r\nThe present unfinished condition of the monument, begun so long ago,\r\nis a reproach to the nation. It can not be doubted that the patriotic\r\nsense of the country will warmly respond to such prompt provision\r\nas may be made for its completion at an early day, and I urge upon\r\nCongress the propriety and necessity of immediate legislation for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of legislation upon the part of Congress, in aid of the\r\nStates, for the education of the whole people in those branches of\r\nstudy which are taught in the common schools of the country is no\r\nlonger a question. The intelligent judgment of the country goes still\r\nfurther, regarding it as also both constitutional and expedient for\r\nthe General Government to extend to technical and higher education,\r\nsuch aid as is deemed essential to the general welfare and to our due\r\nprominence among the enlightened and cultured nations of the world.\r\nThe ultimate settlement of all questions of the future, whether of\r\nadministration or finance or of true nationality of sentiment, depends\r\nupon the virtue and intelligence of the people. It is vain to hope\r\nfor the success of a free government without the means of insuring\r\nthe intelligence of those who are the source of power. No less than\r\none-seventh of the entire voting population of our country are yet\r\nunable to read and write.\r\n\r\nIt is encouraging to observe, in connection with the growth of\r\nfraternal feeling in those States in which slavery formerly existed,\r\nevidences of increasing interest in universal education, and I shall\r\nbe glad to give my approval to any appropriate measures which may be\r\nenacted by Congress for the purpose of supplementing with national aid\r\nthe local systems of education in those States and in all the States;\r\nand, having already invited your attention to the needs of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia with respect to its public-school system, I here\r\nadd that I believe it desirable, not so much with reference to the\r\nlocal wants of the District, but to the great and lasting benefit\r\nof the entire country, that this system should be crowned with a\r\nuniversity in all respects in keeping with the national capital, and\r\nthereby realize the cherished hopes of Washington on this subject.\r\n\r\nI also earnestly commend the request of the Regents of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution that an adequate appropriation be made for\r\nthe establishment and conduct of a national museum under their\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nThe question of providing for the preservation and growth of the\r\nLibrary of Congress is also one of national importance. As the\r\ndepository of all copyright publications and records, this library has\r\noutgrown the provisions for its accommodation; and the erection, on\r\nsuch site as the judgment of Congress may approve, of a fireproof\r\nlibrary building, to preserve the treasures and enlarge the usefulness\r\nof this valuable collection, is recommended. I recommend also such\r\nlegislation as will render available and efficient for the purposes\r\nof instruction, so far as is consistent with the public service, the\r\ncabinets or museums of invention, of surgery, of education, and\r\nof agriculture, and other collections the property of the National\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the nation should be something more than a mere\r\npolitical center. We should avail ourselves of all the opportunities\r\nwhich Providence has here placed at our command to promote the general\r\nintelligence of the people and increase the conditions most favorable\r\nto the success and perpetuity of our institutions.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Correspondence, etc., relative to the selection of M.\r\nMaurice Delfosse as one of the commissioners under the treaty with\r\nGreat Britain of May 8, 1871, on the fisheries question.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 28, 1878_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter a very careful consideration of the House bill No. 1093,\r\nentitled \"An act to authorize the coinage of the standard silver\r\ndollar and to restore its legal-tender character,\" I feel compelled\r\nto return it to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,\r\nwith my objections to its passage.\r\n\r\nHolding the opinion, which I expressed in my annual message, that\r\n\"neither the interests of the Government nor of the people of the\r\nUnited States would be promoted by disparaging silver as one of the\r\ntwo precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world, and that\r\nlegislation which looks to maintaining the volume of intrinsic money\r\nto as full a measure of both metals as their relative commercial\r\nvalues will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient,\" it has\r\nbeen my earnest desire to concur with Congress in the adoption of such\r\nmeasures to increase the silver coinage of the country as would not\r\nimpair the obligation of contracts, either public or private, nor\r\ninjuriously affect the public credit. It is only upon the conviction\r\nthat this bill does not meet these essential requirements that I feel\r\nit my duty to withhold from it my approval.\r\n\r\nMy present official duty as to this bill permits only an attention to\r\nthe specific objections to its passage which seem to me so important\r\nas to justify me in asking from the wisdom and duty of Congress that\r\nfurther consideration of the bill for which the Constitution has in\r\nsuch cases provided.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides for the coinage of silver dollars of the weight of\r\n412-1/2 grains each, of standard silver, to be a legal tender at their\r\nnominal value for all debts and dues, public and private, except where\r\notherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. It is well known that\r\nthe market value of that number of grains of standard silver during\r\nthe past year has been from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the\r\nstandard gold dollar. Thus the silver dollar authorized by this bill\r\nis worth 8 to 10 per cent less than it purports to be worth, and\r\nis made a legal tender for debts contracted when the law did not\r\nrecognize such coins as lawful money.\r\n\r\nThe right to pay duties in silver or in certificates for silver\r\ndeposits will, when they are issued in sufficient amount to circulate,\r\nput an end to the receipt of revenue in gold, and thus compel the\r\npayment of silver for both the principal and interest of the public\r\ndebt. One billion one hundred and forty-three million four hundred\r\nand ninety-three thousand four hundred dollars of the bonded debt now\r\noutstanding was issued prior to February, 1873, when the silver dollar\r\nwas unknown in circulation in this country, and was only a convenient\r\nform of silver bullion for exportation; $583,440,350 of the funded\r\ndebt has been issued since February, 1873, when gold alone was the\r\ncoin for which the bonds were sold, and gold alone was the coin in\r\nwhich both parties to the contract understood that the bonds would\r\nbe paid. These bonds entered into the markets of the world. They were\r\npaid for in gold when silver had greatly depreciated, and when no one\r\nwould have bought them if it had been understood that they would be\r\npaid in silver. The sum of $225,000,000 of these bonds has been sold\r\nduring my Administration for gold coin, and the United States received\r\nthe benefit of these sales by a reduction of the rate of interest to\r\n4 per cent. During the progress of these sales a doubt was suggested\r\nas to the coin in which payment of these bonds would be made. The\r\npublic announcement was thereupon authorized that it was \"not to be\r\nanticipated that any future legislation of Congress or any action\r\nof any department of the Government would sanction or tolerate the\r\nredemption of the principal of these bonds or the payment of the\r\ninterest thereon in coin of less value than the coin authorized by law\r\nat the time of the issue of the bonds, being the coin exacted by the\r\nGovernment in exchange for the same.\" In view of these facts it will\r\nbe justly regarded as a grave breach of the public faith to undertake\r\nto pay these bonds, principal or interest, in silver coin worth in the\r\nmarket less than the coin received for them.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the silver dollar made a legal tender by this bill\r\nwill under its operation be equivalent in value to the gold dollar.\r\nMany supporters of the bill believe this, and would not justify an\r\nattempt to pay debts, either public or private, in coin of inferior\r\nvalue to the money of the world. The capital defect of the bill\r\nis that it contains no provision protecting from its operation\r\npreexisting debts in case the coinage which it creates shall continue\r\nto be of less value than that which was the sole legal tender when\r\nthey were contracted. If it is now proposed, for the purpose of taking\r\nadvantage of the depreciation of silver in the payment of debts, to\r\ncoin and make a legal tender a silver dollar of less commercial value\r\nthan any dollar, whether of gold or paper, which is now lawful money\r\nin this country, such measure, it will hardly be questioned, will,\r\nin the judgment of mankind, be an act of bad faith. As to all debts\r\nheretofore contracted, the silver dollar should be made a legal tender\r\nonly at its market value. The standard of value should not be changed\r\nwithout the consent of both parties to the contract. National promises\r\nshould be kept with unflinching fidelity. There is no power to compel\r\na nation to pay its just debts. Its credit depends on its honor. The\r\nnation owes what it has led or allowed its creditors to expect. I can\r\nnot approve a bill which in my judgment authorizes the violation of\r\nsacred obligations. The obligation of the public faith transcends\r\nall questions of profit or public advantage. Its unquestionable\r\nmaintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency as of\r\nthe most necessary duty, and should ever be carefully guarded by the\r\nExecutive, by Congress, and by the people.\r\n\r\nIt is my firm conviction that if the country is to be benefited by a\r\nsilver coinage it can be done only by the issue of silver dollars of\r\nfull value, which will defraud no man. A currency worth less than it\r\npurports to be worth will in the end defraud not only creditors, but\r\nall who are engaged in legitimate business, and none more surely than\r\nthose who are dependent on their daily labor for their daily bread.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 6, 1878._\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI return herewith House bill No. 3072, entitled \"An act to authorize\r\na special term of the circuit court of the United States for the\r\nsouthern district of Mississippi to be held at Scranton, in Jackson\r\nCounty,\" with the following objections to its becoming a law:\r\n\r\nThe act provides that a special term of the circuit court of the\r\nUnited States for the southern district of Mississippi shall be held\r\nat Scranton, in Jackson County, Miss., to begin on the second Monday\r\nin March, 1878, and directs the clerk of said court to \"cause notice\r\nof said special term of said court to be published in a newspaper in\r\nJackson, Miss., and also in a newspaper in Scranton, at least ten days\r\nbefore the beginning thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe act can not be executed, inasmuch as there is not sufficient time\r\nto give the notice of the holding of the special term which Congress\r\nthought proper to require.\r\n\r\nThe number of suits to be tried at the special term in which the\r\nUnited States is interested is forty-nine, and the amount involved\r\nexceeds $200,000. The Government can not prepare for trial at said\r\nspecial term, because no fund appropriated by Congress can be made\r\navailable for that purpose. If, therefore, the Government is compelled\r\nto go to trial at the special term provided for by this bill, the\r\nUnited States must be defeated for want of time and means to make\r\npreparation for the proper vindication of its rights.\r\n\r\nThe bill is therefore returned for the further consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that whenever,\r\nby reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages of\r\npersons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the\r\nUnited States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the\r\nPresident, to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\r\nthe laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall\r\nbe lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all\r\nthe States and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of\r\nthe United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful\r\nexecution of the laws of the United States or to suppress such\r\nrebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the\r\nUnited States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof\r\nforcibly obstructed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been made to appear to me that, by reason of unlawful\r\ncombinations and assemblages of persons in arms, it has become\r\nimpracticable to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial\r\nproceedings the laws of the United States within the Territory of New\r\nMexico, and especially within Lincoln County therein, and that the\r\nlaws of the United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the\r\nexecution thereof forcibly resisted; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it may be\r\nnecessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military force\r\nfor the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of\r\nthe United States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such\r\ninsurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes\r\nwithin a limited time:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, do hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States,\r\nand especially of the Territory of New Mexico, against aiding,\r\ncountenancing, abetting, or taking part in any such unlawful\r\nproceedings; and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected\r\nwith said obstruction of the laws to disperse and retire peaceably to\r\ntheir respective abodes on or before noon of the 13th day of October\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 7th day of October, A.D. 1878,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nR.B.

SEWARD,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe recurrence of that season at which it is the habit of our people\r\nto make devout and public confession of their constant dependence upon\r\nthe divine favor for all the good gifts of life and happiness and\r\nof public peace and prosperity exhibits in the record of the year\r\nabundant reasons for our gratitude and thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nExuberant harvests, productive mines, ample crops of the staples of\r\ntrade and manufactures, have enriched the country.\r\n\r\nThe resources thus furnished to our reviving industry and expanding\r\ncommerce are hastening the day when discords and distresses through\r\nthe length and breadth of the land will, under the continued favor\r\nof Providence, have given way to confidence and energy and assured\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nPeace with all nations has been maintained unbroken, domestic\r\ntranquillity has prevailed, and the institutions of liberty and\r\njustice which the wisdom and virtue of our fathers established remain\r\nthe glory and defense of their children.\r\n\r\nThe general prevalence of the blessings of health through our wide\r\nland has made more conspicuous the sufferings and sorrows which the\r\ndark shadow of pestilence has cast upon a portion of our people. This\r\nheavy affliction even the Divine Ruler has tempered to the suffering\r\ncommunities in the universal sympathy and succor which have flowed to\r\ntheir relief, and the whole nation may rejoice in the unity of spirit\r\nin our people by which they cheerfully share one another's burdens.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, do appoint Thursday, the 28th day of November next, as a day\r\nof national thanksgiving and prayer; and I earnestly recommend that,\r\nwithdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of\r\nthe United States do meet together on that day in their respective\r\nplaces of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for\r\nHis mercies and to devoutly beseech their continuance.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 30th day of October, A.D. 1878,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nR.B.

COGGESHALL, Esq.,\r\n  _Marshal of the United States for the\r\n  District of Rhode Island, Providence, R.I._\r\n\r\nSIR: By virtue of the authority conferred upon me by section 5287 of\r\nthe Revised Statutes of the United States, and in execution of the\r\nsame, you are hereby empowered and directed to take possession of the\r\nsteamer _Estelle_, now or lately lying at Bristol, in Rhode Island,\r\nand to detain the same until further orders from me concerning the\r\nsame, and to employ such portion of the land and naval forces of the\r\nUnited States as may be necessary for that purpose.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 27, 1878_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[20] I am directed by the President to say that the several\r\nDepartments of the Government will be closed on Thursday, the 30th\r\ninstant, in respect to the memory of those who fell in defense of the\r\nUnion, and to enable the employees to participate in the commemorative\r\nceremonies of the day.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.K. ROGERS, _Private Secretary_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Addressed to the heads of the Executive Departments, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 2, 1878_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOur heartfelt gratitude is due to the Divine Being who holds in His\r\nhands the destinies of nations for the continued bestowal during the\r\nlast year of countless blessings upon our country.\r\n\r\nWe are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit has greatly\r\nimproved, and is perhaps now stronger than ever before. Abundant\r\nharvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our\r\nmanufacturing industries are reviving, and it is believed that general\r\nprosperity, which has been so long anxiously looked for, is at last\r\nwithin our reach.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of health by our people generally has, however, been\r\ninterrupted during the past season by the prevalence of a fatal\r\npestilence (the yellow fever) in some portions of the Southern States,\r\ncreating an emergency which called for prompt and extraordinary\r\nmeasures of relief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans\r\nand at other places on the Lower Mississippi soon after midsummer.\r\nIt was rapidly spread by fugitives from the infected cities and\r\ntowns, and did not disappear until early in November. The States of\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee have suffered severely. About\r\n100,000 cases are believed to have occurred, of which about 20,000,\r\naccording to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossible\r\nto estimate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country\r\noccasioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned by the hundred\r\nmillions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted\r\nexcited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and\r\nnurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted\r\ncommunities. Voluntary contributions of money and supplies, in every\r\nneeded form, were speedily and generously furnished. The Government\r\nwas able to respond in some measure to the call for help, by providing\r\ntents, medicines, and food for the sick and destitute, the requisite\r\ndirections for the purpose being given in the confident expectation\r\nthat this action of the Executive would receive the sanction of\r\nCongress. About 1,800 tents, and rations of the value of about\r\n$25,000, were sent to cities and towns which applied for them,\r\nfull details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general\r\npublic sentiment in favor of national sanitary administration, which\r\nshall not only control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision\r\nof internal commerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory\r\nrelation to the State and municipal health authorities, with power\r\nto deal with whatever endangers the public health, and which the\r\nmunicipal and State authorities are unable to regulate. The national\r\nquarantine act approved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late in\r\nthe last session of Congress to provide the means for carrying it into\r\npractical operation during the past season, is a step in the direction\r\nhere indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective\r\nmeasures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection of our\r\nseaports and the country generally from this and other epidemics,\r\nit is recommended that Congress give to the whole subject early and\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection\r\nof all citizens in every civil and political right continues to be of\r\nparamount interest with the great body of our people. Every step\r\nin this direction is welcomed with public approval, and every\r\ninterruption of steady and uniform progress to the desired\r\nconsummation awakens general uneasiness and widespread condemnation.\r\nThe recent Congressional elections have furnished a direct and\r\ntrustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical\r\nestablishment of the right of suffrage secured by the Constitution to\r\nthe liberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences,\r\nreal or imaginary, had been removed from all of these States.\r\n\r\nThe three constitutional amendments which conferred freedom and\r\nequality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the\r\nSouth were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good\r\ncitizens who maintained the authority of the National Government and\r\nthe integrity and perpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure\r\nand life, as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the\r\njust results of the war. The people of the former slaveholding States\r\naccepted these results, and gave in every practicable form assurances\r\nthat the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, and laws\r\npassed in pursuance thereof, should in good faith be enforced, rigidly\r\nand impartially, in letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest\r\ncitizen, without distinction of race or color, should under them\r\nreceive full and equal protection in person and property and in\r\npolitical rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments\r\nthe southern section of the Union obtained a large increase of\r\npolitical power in Congress and in the electoral college, and the\r\ncountry justly expected that elections would proceed, as to\r\nthe enfranchised race, upon the same circumstances of legal and\r\nconstitutional freedom and protection which obtained in all the other\r\nStates of the Union. The friends of law and order looked forward to\r\nthe conduct of these elections as offering to the general judgment of\r\nthe country an important opportunity to measure the degree in which\r\nthe right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored people and\r\nwould be respected by their fellow-citizens; but a more general\r\nenjoyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people and a more just\r\nand generous protection of that freedom by the communities of which\r\nthey form a part were generally anticipated than the record of the\r\nelections discloses. In some of those States in which the colored\r\npeople have been unable to make their opinions felt in the elections\r\nthe result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or remedied\r\nby legal protection; but in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina\r\nat large, and in some particular Congressional districts outside\r\nof those States, the records of the elections seem to compel the\r\nconclusion that the rights of the colored voters have been overridden\r\nand their participation in the elections not permitted to be either\r\ngeneral or free.\r\n\r\nIt will be for the Congress for which these elections were held to\r\nmake such examinations into their conduct as may be appropriate to\r\ndetermine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In\r\nthe meanwhile it becomes the duty of the executive and judicial\r\ndepartments of the Government, each in its province, to inquire into\r\nand punish violations of the laws of the United States which have\r\noccurred. I can but repeat what I said in this connection in my last\r\nmessage, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not\r\nhesitate to put forth; and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal\r\nto the legislatures, the courts, the executive authorities, and the\r\npeople of the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated to\r\ngive their assistance toward bringing to justice the offenders and\r\npreventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will\r\nbe spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged\r\ncrimes and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the principal appropriation made for the\r\nDepartment of Justice at the last session contained the following\r\nclause:\r\n\r\n  And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the\r\n  enforcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled\r\n  \"An act to amend an act approved May 31, 1870, entitled 'An\r\n  act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States\r\n  to vote in the several States of this Union, and for other\r\n  purposes,'\" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary\r\n  thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of the Attorney-General that the expenses of these\r\nproceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided,\r\nand I rely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations\r\nto enable the executive department to enforce the laws.\r\n\r\nI respectfully urge upon your attention that the Congressional\r\nelections, in every district, in a very important sense, are justly a\r\nmatter of political interest and concern throughout the whole country.\r\nEach State, every political party, is entitled to the share of power\r\nwhich is conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the\r\nright of every citizen possessing the qualifications prescribed by\r\nlaw to cast one unintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly\r\ncounted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of\r\nthis right are common and equal, practically as well as formally,\r\nsubmission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and\r\ncheerfully, and all the departments of Government will feel the\r\ntrue vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No temporary or\r\nadministrative interests of Government, however urgent or weighty,\r\nwill ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary\r\nrights of citizenship. They understand that the protection of liberty\r\nrequires the maintenance in full vigor of the manly methods of free\r\nspeech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the full\r\nauthority of Government to enforce the laws which are framed to\r\npreserve these inestimable rights. The material progress and welfare\r\nof the States depend on the protection afforded to their citizens.\r\nThere can be no peace without such protection, no prosperity without\r\npeace, and the whole country is deeply interested in the growth and\r\nprosperity of all its parts.\r\n\r\nWhile the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling\r\nand reciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so\r\nseriously estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies\r\nare in that direction, and with increasing force. The power of public\r\nopinion will override all political prejudices and all sectional or\r\nState attachments in demanding that all over our wide territory the\r\nname and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and\r\nthe same thing and carry with them unchallenged security and respect.\r\n\r\nOur relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutrality\r\nin contests between foreign powers has been maintained and respected.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been\r\nattended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed\r\nfor the preparation and arrangement of the contributions of our\r\ncitizens to this great exposition was well employed in energetic and\r\njudicious efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These efforts, led\r\nand directed by the commissioner-general, were remarkably successful,\r\nand the exhibition of the products of American industry was creditable\r\nand gratifying in scope and character. The reports of the United\r\nStates commissioners, giving its results in detail, will be duly laid\r\nbefore you. Our participation in this international competition for\r\nthe favor and the trade of the world may be expected to produce useful\r\nand important results--in promoting intercourse, friendship, and\r\ncommerce with other nations.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878,\r\nthree commissioners were appointed to an international conference on\r\nthe subject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for\r\nthe purpose of establishing internationally the use of bimetallic\r\nmoney and securing fixity of relative value between those metals.\r\n\r\nInvitations were addressed to the various governments which had\r\nexpressed a willingness to participate in its deliberations. The\r\nconference held its meetings in Paris in August last. The report\r\nof the commissioners, herewith submitted, will show its results.\r\nNo common ratio between gold and silver could be agreed upon by the\r\nconference. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to\r\nmaintain in the world the monetary functions of silver as well as of\r\ngold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other of these\r\ntwo metals, or of both, to be made by each state.\r\n\r\nCongress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000\r\nto pay the award of the joint commission at Halifax, if, after\r\ncorrespondence with the British Government on the subject of the\r\nconformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to\r\nthe terms of the question thereby submitted to the commission, the\r\nPresident shall deem it his duty to make the payment, communications\r\nupon these points were addressed to the British Government through\r\nthe legation of the United States at London. Failing to obtain the\r\nconcurrence of the British Government in the views of this Government\r\nrespecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named\r\nwithin the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the\r\ngrounds of the payment and a protest against any other construction\r\nof the same. The correspondence upon this subject will be laid before\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government has officially announced the termination of\r\nthe insurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace throughout that\r\nisland. Confident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade\r\nand prosperity, which it is earnestly hoped may prove well founded.\r\nNumerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries\r\nor restoration of property have been among the incidents of the\r\nlong-continued hostilities. Some of these claims are in process of\r\nadjustment by Spain, and the others are promised early and careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal consular privileges\r\nhas been duly ratified and proclaimed.\r\n\r\nNo questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the\r\nEuropean powers.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government has been desirous of a revision of such parts\r\nof its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and it is\r\nunderstood has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to\r\nopen negotiations with that view. The United States Government has\r\nbeen inclined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions\r\nupon trade with Japan are found injurious to that people can not but\r\naffect injuriously nations holding commercial intercourse with them.\r\nJapan, after a long period of seclusion, has within the past few years\r\nmade rapid strides in the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not\r\nunreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with\r\nthe nations of Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which\r\nthey hold with each other. A treaty looking to this end has been made,\r\nwhich will be submitted for the consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of several years the Chinese Government has again\r\nsent envoys to the United States. They have been received, and a\r\npermanent legation is now established here by that Government. It is\r\nnot doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in\r\npromoting friendly relations and removing causes of difference.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with the Samoan Islands, having been duly ratified and\r\naccepted on the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a\r\nsurvey and soundings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a\r\nnaval vessel of the United States, with a view of its occupation as\r\na naval station if found desirable to the service.\r\n\r\nSince the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico\r\ncorrespondence has been opened and still continues between the two\r\nGovernments upon the various questions which at one time seemed to\r\nendanger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached\r\nas to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress and\r\ndiminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio\r\nGrande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has\r\ndone much to remove the sources of dispute, and it is now understood\r\nthat a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is\r\nalso making an energetic movement against the marauding Indian tribes.\r\nThis Government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every\r\nevidence of strength in the national authority of Mexico, and upon\r\nevery effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon our\r\nterritory. Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in the control\r\nof these incursions by military movements across the border not\r\nimperatively demanded for the protection of the lives and property\r\nof our own citizens, I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent\r\nwith the proper discharge of this plain duty to recognize the ability\r\nof the Mexican Government to restrain effectively violations of\r\nour territory. It is proposed to hold next year an international\r\nexhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the display of the\r\nagricultural and manufacturing products of the two nations will tend\r\nto better understanding and increased commercial intercourse between\r\ntheir people.\r\n\r\nWith Brazil and the Republics of Central and South America some\r\nsteps have been taken toward the development of closer commercial\r\nintercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Colombia and\r\nwith Bolivia. A boundary question between the Argentine Republic and\r\nParaguay has been submitted by those Governments for arbitration\r\nto the President of the United States, and I have, after careful\r\nexamination, given a decision upon it.\r\n\r\nA naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers has brought back\r\ninformation valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A\r\nlike expedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian\r\nOcean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation\r\nto the development of our foreign commerce have furnished many facts\r\nthat have proved of public interest and have stimulated to practical\r\nexertion the enterprise of our people.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury furnishes a detailed\r\nstatement of the operations of that Department of the Government and\r\nof the condition of the public finances.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June\r\n30, 1878, were $257,763,878.70; the ordinary expenditures for the same\r\nperiod were $236,964,326.80, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of\r\n$20,799,551.90. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June\r\n30, 1879, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for\r\nthe first quarter, commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389,743.43;\r\nestimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year,\r\n$191,110,256.57; total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual\r\nand estimated, $264,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will\r\nbe, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July\r\n1, 1878, actual expenditures, $73,344,573.27; and for the remaining\r\nthree quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at\r\n$166,755,426.73, making the total expenditures $240,100,000, and\r\nleaving an estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 30,\r\n1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year,\r\nending June 30, 1880, estimated according to existing laws, will be\r\n$264,500,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same\r\nperiod will be $236,320,412.68, leaving a surplus of $28,179,587.32\r\nfor that year.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual and estimated,\r\nno amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act\r\napproved February 25, 1862, which requires that 1 per cent of the\r\nentire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within\r\neach fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been,\r\nhowever, a substantial compliance with the conditions of the law. By\r\nits terms the public debt should have been reduced between 1862\r\nand the close of the last fiscal year $518,361,806.28; the\r\nactual reduction of the ascertained debt in that period has been\r\n$720,644,739.61, being in excess of the reduction required by the\r\nsinking fund act $202,282,933.33.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt, less cash in the Treasury, November 1,\r\n1878, was $2,024,200,083.18, a reduction since the same date last year\r\nof $23,150,617.39.\r\n\r\nThe progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at\r\nlower rates of interest is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent\r\nbonds sold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is\r\n$100,270,900, and 6 per cent bonds, commonly known as five-twenties,\r\nto an equal amount, have been or will be redeemed as calls mature.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the Department to place the 4 per cent bonds\r\nwithin easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings,\r\nwhether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the\r\nTreasury recommends that the law be so modified that small sums may\r\nbe invested, and that through the post-offices or other agents of the\r\nGovernment the freest opportunity may be given in all parts of the\r\ncountry for such investments.\r\n\r\nThe best mode suggested is that the Department be authorized to issue\r\ncertificates of deposit, of the denomination of $10, bearing interest\r\nat the rate of 3.65 per cent per annum and convertible at any time\r\nwithin one year after their issue into the 4 per cent bonds authorized\r\nby the refunding act, and to be issued only in exchange for United\r\nStates notes sent to the Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a\r\nprovision of law, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any\r\nperson readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into an\r\ninterest-bearing security of the United States, and the money so\r\nreceived could be applied to the redemption of 6 per cent bonds.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was $52,798,980. The\r\ncoinage of silver dollars under the act passed February 28, 1878,\r\namounted on the 23d of November, 1878, to $19,814,550, of which amount\r\n$4,984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still\r\nin the possession of the Government.\r\n\r\nWith views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of\r\nsilver proceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secretary faithfully\r\nto execute the law and to afford a fair trial to the measure.\r\n\r\nIn the present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that\r\nthe welfare of legitimate business and industry of every description\r\nwill be best promoted by abstaining from all attempts to make radical\r\nchanges in the existing financial legislation. Let it be understood\r\nthat during the coming year the business of the country will be\r\nundisturbed by governmental interference with the laws affecting it,\r\nand we may confidently expect that the resumption of specie payments,\r\nwhich will take place at the appointed time, will be successfully and\r\neasily maintained, and that it will be followed by a healthful and\r\nenduring revival of business prosperity.\r\n\r\nLet the healing influence of time, the inherent energies of our\r\npeople, and the boundless resources of our country have a fair\r\nopportunity, and relief from present difficulties will surely follow.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been well\r\nand economically supplied; that our small force has been actively\r\nemployed and has faithfully performed all the service required of it.\r\nThe morale of the Army has improved and the number of desertions has\r\nmaterially decreased during the year.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary recommends--\r\n\r\n1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry\r\nH. Benner, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever\r\nwhile in command of the steamer _J.M. Chambers_, sent with supplies\r\nfor the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease.\r\n\r\n2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the\r\nheirs of deceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster-General.\r\n\r\n3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the publication of the\r\nrecords of the War of the Rebellion, now being prepared for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier teachers employed in\r\npost schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings\r\nfor schools and libraries at the different posts.\r\n\r\n5. The repeal or amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, forbidding the\r\nuse of the Army \"as a _posse comitatus_, or otherwise, for the\r\npurpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under such\r\ncircumstances as such employment of said force may be expressly\r\nauthorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress.\"\r\n\r\n6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues\r\nof rations, tents, and medicines which were made for the relief of\r\nsufferers from yellow fever.\r\n\r\n7. That provision be made for the erection of a fireproof building for\r\nthe preservation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed\r\nto destruction by fire.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations are all commended to your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the Navy\r\nhas improved during the last fiscal year. Work has been done on\r\nseventy-five vessels, ten of which have been thoroughly repaired\r\nand made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward\r\ncompletion. The total expenditures of the year, including the\r\namount appropriated for the deficiencies of the previous year, were\r\n$17,468,392.65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive\r\nof these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18 less than\r\nthose of the previous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than the expenses\r\nincluding the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1880, are $14,562,381.45, exceeding the appropriations of\r\nthe present year only $33,949.75, which excess is occasioned by the\r\ndemands of the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the\r\nSecretary's report. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are\r\n$14,528,431.70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample\r\nfor all the current expenses of the Department during the year. The\r\namount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1878, is\r\n$4,740,544.14, of which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the\r\nexpenditure for that period $4,669,563.39, or $520,899.24 less than\r\nthe corresponding period of the last fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of\r\nthe operations of the Post-Office Department. The expenditures of\r\nthat Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were\r\n$34,165,084.49. The receipts, including sales of stamps, money-order\r\nbusiness, and official stamps, were $29,277,516.95. The sum of\r\n$290,436.90, included in the foregoing statement of expenditures, is\r\nchargeable to preceding years, so that the actual expenditures for the\r\nfiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are $33,874,647.59. The amount drawn\r\nfrom the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of\r\nthe Department, was $5,307,652.82. The expenditures for the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1880, are estimated at $36,571,900 and the\r\nreceipts from all sources at $30,664,023.90, leaving a deficiency to\r\nbe appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876.10. The report calls\r\nattention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters and of\r\nrailroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that the\r\nfailure of Congress to appropriate the amounts required for these\r\npurposes does not relieve the Government of responsibility, but\r\nnecessarily increases the deficiency bills which Congress will be\r\ncalled upon to pass.\r\n\r\nIn providing for the postal service the following questions are\r\npresented: Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses\r\nlargely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be\r\nestablished as will make the Department self-sustaining? Should the\r\npostal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which\r\ndoes not pay its way? Should the number of post routes be diminished?\r\nShould other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or\r\ndiminish the expenses of the postal service?\r\n\r\nThe International Postal Congress which met at Paris May 1, 1878, and\r\ncontinued in session until June 4 of the same year, was composed of\r\ndelegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It\r\nadopted a new convention (to take the place of the treaty concluded\r\nat Berne October 9, 1874), which goes into effect on the 1st of April,\r\n1879, between the countries whose delegates have signed it. It was\r\nratified and approved, by and with the consent of the President,\r\nAugust 13, 1878. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Convention will\r\nbe found in the report of the Postmaster-General, and the full text\r\nin the appendix thereto. In its origin the Postal Union comprised\r\ntwenty-three countries, having a population of 350,000,000 people.\r\nOn the 1st of April next it will comprise forty-three countries and\r\ncolonies, with a population of more than 650,000,000 people, and will\r\nsoon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies\r\nwhich maintain organized postal services, constitute in fact as well\r\nas in name, as its new title indicates, a universal union, regulating,\r\nupon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal intercourse\r\nbetween all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nSome embarrassment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs\r\nlaws of this country and the provisions of the Postal Convention in\r\nregard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this\r\ncountry by mail. It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some\r\nmeans of reconciling the difficulties which have thus been created, so\r\nas to do justice to all parties involved.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Supreme Court and of the courts in many of the\r\ncircuits has increased to such an extent during the past year that\r\nadditional legislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the\r\ndelay of justice and possible oppression to suitors which is thus\r\noccasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets is presented\r\nanew in the report of the Attorney-General, and the remedy suggested\r\nis earnestly urged for Congressional action. The creation of\r\nadditional circuit judges, as proposed, would afford a complete\r\nremedy, and would involve an expense, at the present rate of salaries,\r\nof not more than $60,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs present an elaborate account of the\r\npresent condition of the Indian tribes and of that branch of the\r\npublic service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct\r\nof the Indians generally has been orderly and their relations with\r\ntheir neighbors friendly and peaceable, two local disturbances have\r\noccurred, which were deplorable in their character, but remained,\r\nhappily, confined to a comparatively small number of Indians. The\r\ndiscontent among the Bannocks, which led first to some acts of\r\nviolence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to the\r\noutbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food\r\non the reservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the\r\ninadequacy of the appropriations made by Congress to the wants of the\r\nIndians at a time when the Indians were prevented from supplying the\r\ndeficiency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the troops of\r\nthe United States, and several engagements, the hostile Indians\r\nwere reduced to subjection, and the larger part of them surrendered\r\nthemselves as prisoners. In this connection I desire to call attention\r\nto the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that\r\na sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of the Executive, to be\r\nused, with proper accountability, at discretion, in sudden emergencies\r\nof the Indian service.\r\n\r\nThe other case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern\r\nCheyennes, who suddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory\r\nand marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the\r\ndirection of their old hunting grounds, committing murders and other\r\ncrimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior it appears that this disorderly band was as\r\nfully supplied with the necessaries of life as the 4,700 other Indians\r\nwho remained quietly on the reservation, and that the disturbance\r\nwas caused by men of a restless and mischievous disposition among the\r\nIndians themselves. Almost the whole of this band have surrendered to\r\nthe military authorities; and it is a gratifying fact that when some\r\nof them had taken refuge in the camp of the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom\r\nthey had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners\r\nand readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus\r\ngiving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the\r\nwishes they expressed at the council of September, 1877, had been\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nBoth the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite\r\nin the recommendation that provision be made by Congress for the\r\norganization of a corps of mounted \"Indian auxiliaries,\" to be under\r\nthe control of the Army and to be used for the purpose of keeping the\r\nIndians on their reservations and preventing or repressing disturbance\r\non their part. I earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is\r\nbelieved that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry,\r\nreceiving a moderate pay from the Government, would considerably\r\nweaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it\r\na number of young men and giving them congenial employment under\r\nthe Government, it being a matter of experience that Indians in our\r\nservice almost without exception are faithful in the performance of\r\nthe duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially\r\naid the Army in the accomplishment of a task for which its numerical\r\nstrength is sometimes found insufficient.\r\n\r\nBut while the employment of force for the prevention or repression\r\nof Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation\r\nshould be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane\r\nand civilizing agencies for the ultimate solution of what is called\r\nthe Indian problem. It may be very difficult and require much\r\npatient effort to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the\r\nrestraints of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not\r\nimpossible. Many of the tribes which are now quiet and orderly and\r\nself-supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam\r\nover the plains or in the mountains of the far West, and were then\r\nconsidered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible\r\nto raise them fully up to the level of the white population of the\r\nUnited States; but we should not forget that they are the aborigines\r\nof the country, and called the soil their own on which our people have\r\ngrown rich, powerful, and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to\r\nhelp them in attaining at least that degree of civilization which they\r\nmay be able to reach. It is not only our duty, it is also our interest\r\nto do so. Indians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel\r\nan interest in property, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and\r\ndisturbing element. It is also a well-authenticated fact that Indians\r\nare apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school,\r\nand I am gratified to know, from the expressions of Indians themselves\r\nand from many concurring reports, that there is a steadily increasing\r\ndesire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to\r\nhave their children educated. I invite attention to the reports of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\ntouching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking fifty Indian\r\nchildren, boys and girls, from different tribes, to the Hampton Normal\r\nAgricultural Institute in Virginia, where they are to receive an\r\nelementary English education and training in agriculture and other\r\nuseful works, to be returned to their tribes, after the completed\r\ncourse, as interpreters, instructors, and examples. It is reported\r\nthat the officer charged with the selection of those children might\r\nhave had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possible\r\nto make provision for them. I agree with the Secretary of the\r\nInterior in saying that \"the result of this interesting experiment,\r\nif favorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the\r\nadvancement of civilization among the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nThe question whether a change in the control of the Indian service\r\nshould be made was at the last session of Congress referred to a\r\ncommittee for inquiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate\r\nthat report, I venture to express the hope that in the decision of so\r\nimportant a question the views expressed above may not be lost sight\r\nof, and that the decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further\r\nagitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce\r\na disturbing effect upon the service, as well as on the Indians\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the enrollment of the bill making appropriations for sundry civil\r\nexpenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided\r\nfor the continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As\r\nthe commission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many\r\nconflicting claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining\r\nthe rights of claimants, threatened for a time to embarrass the\r\ninterests, not only of the Government, but also of a large number\r\nof the citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on\r\ntheir claims before beginning contemplated improvements. In order\r\nto prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended, and at\r\nthe solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot Springs and others\r\ninterested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary of the Interior\r\nwas authorized to request the late commissioners to take charge of\r\nthe records of their proceedings and to perform such work as could\r\nproperly be done by them under such circumstances to facilitate the\r\nfuture adjudication of the claims at an early day and to preserve\r\nthe status of the claimants until their rights should be finally\r\ndetermined. The late commissioners complied with that request, and\r\nreport that the testimony in all the cases has been written out,\r\nexamined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an early\r\nsettlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the\r\nrequisite authority be given at as early a day in the session\r\nas possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the late\r\ncommissioners for the expense incurred and the labor performed\r\nby them since the 25th of June last.\r\n\r\nI invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the\r\ntimber on the public lands of the United States. The protection of\r\nthe public property is one of the first duties of the Government. The\r\nDepartment of the Interior should therefore be enabled by sufficient\r\nappropriations to enforce the laws in that respect. But this matter\r\nappears still more important as a question of public economy. The\r\nrapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest\r\nconsequences, especially in the mountainous districts, where the rocky\r\nslopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There\r\nthe injury, once done, can not be repaired. I fully concur with\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that for this reason\r\nlegislation touching the public timber in the mountainous States and\r\nTerritories of the West should be especially well considered, and\r\nthat existing laws in which the destruction of the forests is not\r\nsufficiently guarded against should be speedily modified. A general\r\nlaw concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of\r\nurgent public necessity.\r\n\r\nFrom the organization of the Government the importance of encouraging\r\nby all possible means the increase of our agricultural productions\r\nhas been acknowledged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the\r\npeople as the surest and readiest means of increasing our substantial\r\nand enduring prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe words of Washington are as applicable to-day as when, in his\r\neighth annual message, he said:\r\n\r\n  It will not be doubted that, with reference either to\r\n  individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary\r\n  importance. In proportion as nations advance in population\r\n  and other circumstances of maturity this truth becomes more\r\n  apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and\r\n  more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting\r\n  it grow up, supported by the public purse; and to what object\r\n  can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means\r\n  which have been employed to this end none have been attended\r\n  with greater success than the establishment of boards\r\n  (composed of proper characters) charged with collecting and\r\n  diffusing information, and enabled by premiums and small\r\n  pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery\r\n  and improvement. This species of establishment contributes\r\n  doubly to the increase of improvement, by stimulating to\r\n  enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common center\r\n  the results everywhere of individual skill and observation\r\n  and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience\r\n  accordingly hath shewn that they are very cheap instruments of\r\n  immense national benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the agricultural over any other interest in the\r\nUnited States entitles it to all the consideration claimed for it by\r\nWashington. About one-half of the population of the United States is\r\nengaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the\r\nUnited States for the year 1878 is estimated at $3,000,000,000. The\r\nexports of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from\r\nthe report of the Bureau of Statistics, were $524,000,000. The great\r\nextent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables\r\nus to produce within our own borders and by our own labor not only the\r\nnecessaries, but most of the luxuries, that are consumed in civilized\r\ncountries. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate, and\r\nintercommunication, it appears from the statistical statements in the\r\nreport of the Commissioner of Agriculture that we import annually from\r\nforeign lands many millions of dollars worth of agricultural products\r\nwhich could be raised in our own country.\r\n\r\nNumerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture\r\nwhich can only be answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes\r\nfruitless, which are beyond the means of private individuals and are\r\na just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the\r\nnation. It is good policy, especially in times of depression\r\nand uncertainty in other business pursuits, with a vast area of\r\nuncultivated, and hence unproductive, territory, wisely opened to\r\nhomestead settlement, to encourage by every proper and legitimate\r\nmeans the occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of\r\nthe Department of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new\r\nagricultural industries, to improve the quality and increase the\r\nquantity of our products, to determine the value of old or establish\r\nthe importance of new methods of culture, are worthy of your careful\r\nand favorable consideration, and assistance by such appropriations of\r\nmoney and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the\r\npresent favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of\r\nthis important interest.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of animals in transit is widely attracting public attention.\r\nA national convention of societies specially interested in the subject\r\nhas recently met at Baltimore, and the facts developed, both in regard\r\nto cruelties to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon the\r\npublic health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of\r\nCongress and the enactment of more efficient laws for the prevention\r\nof these abuses.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows\r\nvery gratifying progress throughout the country in all the interests\r\ncommitted to the care of this important office. The report is\r\nespecially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantages\r\nof the common-school system in sections of the country where the\r\ngeneral enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nTo education more than to any other agency we are to look as the\r\nresource for the advancement of the people in the requisite knowledge\r\nand appreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and\r\nI desire to repeat the suggestion contained in my former message in\r\nbehalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by Congress for\r\nthe purpose of supplementing with national aid the local systems of\r\neducation in the several States.\r\n\r\nAdequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing\r\nthe capacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, should be\r\nprovided without further delay. This invaluable collection of books,\r\nmanuscripts, and illustrative art has grown to such proportions, in\r\nconnection with the copyright system of the country, as to demand the\r\nprompt and careful attention of Congress to save it from injury in its\r\npresent crowded and insufficient quarters. As this library is national\r\nin its character, and must from the nature of the case increase even\r\nmore rapidly in the future than in the past, it can not be doubted\r\nthat the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and\r\nto enlarge its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the means\r\nto organize, exhibit, and make available for the public benefit the\r\narticles now stored away belonging to the National Museum I heartily\r\nrecommend to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is again invited to the condition of\r\nthe river front of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital\r\nimportance to the health of the residents of the national capital,\r\nboth temporary and permanent, that the lowlands in front of the city,\r\nnow subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed. In their present\r\ncondition these flats obstruct the drainage of the city and are a\r\ndangerous source of malarial poison. The reclamation will improve the\r\nnavigation of the river by restricting, and consequently deepening,\r\nits channel, and is also of importance when considered in connection\r\nwith the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the\r\npark west and south of the Washington Monument. The report of the\r\nboard of survey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress, on\r\nthe improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is\r\nrespectfully commended to consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents\r\na detailed statement of the affairs of the District.\r\n\r\nThe relative expenditures by the United States and the District for\r\nlocal purposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the\r\npeople of the District greatly exceed those of the General Government.\r\nThe exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite\r\nrepair of the defective pavements and sewers of the city, which is\r\na work of immediate necessity; and in the same connection a plan is\r\npresented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of\r\nthe District.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions of the District\r\nare all entitled to the favorable attention of Congress. The Reform\r\nSchool needs additional buildings and teachers. Appropriations which\r\nwill place all of these institutions in a condition to become models\r\nof usefulness and beneficence will be regarded by the country as\r\nliberality wisely bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to the\r\ndiscrimination made by Congress against the District in the donation\r\nof land for the support of the public schools, and ask that the same\r\nliberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various\r\nStates and Territories of the United States may be extended to the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflicted upon\r\npublic and private interests by the present location of the depots and\r\nswitching tracks of the several railroads entering the city, and ask\r\nfor legislation looking to their removal. The recommendations and\r\nsuggestions contained in the report will, I trust, receive the careful\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nSufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization\r\nof the government of the District under the recent legislation\r\nof Congress for the expression of a confident opinion as to its\r\nsuccessful operation, but the practical results already attained are\r\nso satisfactory that the friends of the new government may well\r\nurge upon Congress the wisdom of its continuance, without essential\r\nmodification, until by actual experience its advantages and defects\r\nmay be more fully ascertained.\r\n\r\nR.B.

For fully twenty years previous to 1877 the\r\nshipment of gold was constant and heavy--so heavy during the entire\r\nperiod of the suspension of specie payments as to preclude the hope of\r\nresumption safely during its continuance. In 1876, however, vigorous\r\nefforts were made by enterprising citizens of the country, and have\r\nsince been continued, to extend our general commerce with foreign\r\nlands, especially in manufactured articles, and these efforts have\r\nbeen attended with very marked success.\r\n\r\nThe importation of manufactured goods was at the same time reduced in\r\nan equal degree, and the result has been an extraordinary reversal\r\nof the conditions so long prevailing and a complete cessation of\r\nthe outward drain of gold. The official statement of the values\r\nrepresented in foreign commerce will show the unprecedented magnitude\r\nto which the movement has attained, and the protection thus secured to\r\nthe public interests at the time when commercial security has become\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThe agencies through which this change has been effected must be\r\nmaintained and strengthened if the future is to be made secure. A\r\nreturn to excessive imports or to a material decline in export trade\r\nwould render possible a return to the former condition of adverse\r\nbalances, with the inevitable outward drain of gold as a necessary\r\nconsequence. Every element of aid to the introduction of the\r\nproducts of our soil and manufactures into new markets should be made\r\navailable. At present such is the favor in which many of the products\r\nof the United States are held that they obtain a remunerative\r\ndistribution, notwithstanding positive differences of cost resulting\r\nfrom our defective shipping and the imperfection of our arrangements\r\nin every respect, in comparison with those of our competitors, for\r\nconducting trade with foreign markets.\r\n\r\nIf we have equal commercial facilities, we need not fear competition\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nThe laws have now directed a resumption of financial equality with\r\nother nations, and have ordered a return to the basis of coin values.\r\nIt is of the greatest importance that the commercial condition now\r\nfortunately attained shall be made permanent, and that our rapidly\r\nincreasing export trade shall not be allowed to suffer for want of the\r\nordinary means of communication with other countries.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying reports contain a valuable and instructive summary of\r\ninformation with respect to our commercial interests in South America,\r\nwhere an inviting field for the enterprise of our people is presented.\r\nThey are transmitted with the assurance that any measures that may be\r\nenacted in furtherance of these important interests will meet with my\r\ncordial approval.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 31, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter of the Secretary of the Treasury, in\r\nrelation to the suspension of the late collector and naval officer of\r\nthe port of New York, with accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nIn addition thereto I respectfully submit the following observations:\r\n\r\nThe custom-house in New York collects more than two-thirds of all the\r\ncustoms revenues of the Government. Its administration is a matter not\r\nof local interest merely, but is of great importance to the people\r\nof the whole country. For a long period of time it has been used to\r\nmanage and control political affairs.\r\n\r\nThe officers suspended by me are and for several years have been\r\nengaged in the active personal management of the party politics of\r\nthe city and State of New York. The duties of the offices held by\r\nthem have been regarded as of subordinate importance to their partisan\r\nwork. Their offices have been conducted as part of the political\r\nmachinery under their control. They have made the custom-house a\r\ncenter of partisan political management. The custom-house should be\r\na business office. It should be conducted on business principles.\r\nGeneral James, the postmaster of New York City, writing on this\r\nsubject, says:\r\n\r\nThe post-office is a business institution, and should be run as such.\r\nIt is my deliberate judgment that I and my subordinates can do more\r\nfor the party of our choice by giving the people of this city a\r\ngood and efficient postal service than by controlling primaries or\r\ndictating nominations.\r\n\r\nThe New York custom-house should be placed on the same footing\r\nwith the New York post-office. But under the suspended officers the\r\ncustom-house would be one of the principal political agencies in the\r\nState of New York. To change this, they profess to believe, would be,\r\nin the language of Mr. Cornell in his response, \"to surrender their\r\npersonal and political rights.\"\r\n\r\nConvinced that the people of New York and of the country generally\r\nwish the New York custom-house to be administered solely with a view\r\nto the public interest, it is my purpose to do all in my power\r\nto introduce into this great office the reforms which the country\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nWith my information of the facts in the case, and with a deep sense\r\nof the responsible obligation imposed upon me by the Constitution \"to\r\ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" I regard it as\r\nmy plain duty to suspend the officers in question and to make the\r\nnominations now before the Senate, in order that this important office\r\nmay be honestly and efficiently administered.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, with the accompanying papers therein referred\r\nto, in relation to the proceedings of the International Monetary\r\nConference held at Paris in August, 1878.\r\n\r\nR.B.

The very\r\nample and generous contributions which the foreign nations made to\r\nthe splendor and usefulness of the exhibition and the cordiality with\r\nwhich their representatives took part in our national commemoration\r\ndeserve our profound acknowledgments. At this close of the great\r\nservices rendered by the United States Centennial Commission and the\r\nCentennial board of finance, it gives me great pleasure to commend\r\nto your attention and that of the people of the whole country the\r\nlaborious, faithful, and prosperous performances of their duties which\r\nhave marked the administration of their respective trusts.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 1, 1879._\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter a very careful consideration of House bill 2423, entitled \"An\r\nact to restrict the immigration of Chinese to the United States,\"\r\nI herewith return it to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated, with my objections to its passage.\r\n\r\nThe bill, as it was sent to the Senate from the House of\r\nRepresentatives, was confined in its provisions to the object named\r\nin its title, which is that of \"An act to restrict the immigration of\r\nChinese to the United States.\" The only means adopted to secure the\r\nproposed object was the limitation on the number of Chinese passengers\r\nwhich might be brought to this country by any one vessel to fifteen;\r\nand as this number was not fixed in any proportion to the size\r\nor tonnage of the vessel or by any consideration of the safety or\r\naccommodation of these passengers, the simple purpose and effect of\r\nthe enactment were to repress this immigration to an extent falling\r\nbut little short of its absolute exclusion.\r\n\r\nThe bill, as amended in the Senate and now presented to me, includes\r\nan independent and additional provision which aims at and in terms\r\nrequires the abrogation by this Government of Articles V and VI of the\r\ntreaty with China commonly called the Burlingame treaty, through the\r\naction of the Executive enjoined by this provision of the act.\r\n\r\nThe Burlingame treaty, of which the ratifications were exchanged at\r\nPeking November 23, 1869, recites as the occasion and motive of its\r\nnegotiation by the two Governments that \"since the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty between the United States of America and the Ta Tsing Empire\r\n(China) of the 18th of June, 1858, circumstances have arisen showing\r\nthe necessity of additional articles thereto,\" and proceeds to\r\nan agreement as to said additional articles. These negotiations,\r\ntherefore, ending by the signature of the additional articles July\r\n28, 1868, had for their object the completion of our treaty rights\r\nand obligations toward the Government of China by the incorporation\r\nof these new articles as thenceforth parts of the principal treaty\r\nto which they are made supplemental. Upon the settled rules of\r\ninterpretation applicable to such supplemental negotiations the text\r\nof the principal treaty and of these \"additional articles thereto\"\r\nconstitute one treaty from the conclusion of the new negotiations, in\r\nall parts of equal and concurrent force and obligation between the\r\ntwo Governments, and to all intents and purposes as if embraced in one\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe principal treaty, of which the ratifications were exchanged August\r\n16, 1859, recites that \"the United States of America and the Ta Tsing\r\nEmpire, desiring to maintain firm, lasting, and sincere friendship,\r\nhave resolved to renew, in a manner clear and positive, by means of a\r\ntreaty or general convention of peace, amity, and commerce, the rules\r\nwhich shall in future be mutually observed in the intercourse of their\r\nrespective countries,\" and proceeds in its thirty articles to lay out\r\na careful and comprehensive system for the commercial relations of our\r\npeople with China. The main substance of all the provisions of this\r\ntreaty is to define and secure the rights of our people in respect\r\nof access to, residence and protection in, and trade with China. The\r\nactual provisions in our favor in these respects were framed to be,\r\nand have been found to be, adequate and appropriate to the interests\r\nof our commerce, and by the concluding article we receive the\r\nimportant guaranty that--\r\n\r\n  Should at any time the Ta Tsing Empire grant to any nation, or the\r\n  merchants or citizens of any nation, any right, privilege, or favor,\r\n  connected either with navigation, commerce, political or other\r\n  intercourse, which is not conferred by this treaty, such right,\r\n  privilege, and favor shall at once freely inure to the benefit of\r\n  the United States, its public officers, merchants, and citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgainst this body of stipulations in our favor and this permanent\r\nengagement of equality in respect of all future concessions to foreign\r\nnations the general promise of permanent peace and good offices on\r\nour part seems to be the only equivalent. For this the first article\r\nundertakes as follows:\r\n\r\n  There shall be, as there have always been, peace and friendship\r\n  between the United States of America and the Ta Tsing Empire, and\r\n  between their people respectively. They shall not insult or oppress\r\n  each other for any trifling cause, so as to produce an estrangement\r\n  between them; and if any other nation should act unjustly or\r\n  oppressively, the United States will exert their good offices, on\r\n  being informed of the case, to bring about an amicable arrangement\r\n  of the question, thus showing their friendly feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the date of the negotiation of this treaty our Pacific possessions\r\nhad attracted a considerable Chinese emigration, and the advantages\r\nand the inconveniences felt or feared therefrom had become more or\r\nless manifest; but they dictated no stipulations on the subject to be\r\nincorporated in the treaty. The year 1868 was marked by the striking\r\nevent of a spontaneous embassy from the Chinese Empire, headed by\r\nan American citizen, Anson Burlingame, who had relinquished his\r\ndiplomatic representation of his own country in China to assume that\r\nof the Chinese Empire to the United States and the European nations.\r\nBy this time the facts of the Chinese immigration and its nature and\r\ninfluences, present and prospective, had become more noticeable and\r\nwere more observed by the population immediately affected and by this\r\nGovernment. The principal feature of the Burlingame treaty was its\r\nattention to and its treatment of the Chinese immigration and the\r\nChinese as forming, or as they should form, a part of our population.\r\nUp to this time our uncovenanted hospitality to immigration, our\r\nfearless liberality of citizenship, our equal and comprehensive\r\njustice to all inhabitants, whether they abjured their foreign\r\nnationality or not, our civil freedom, and our religious toleration\r\nhad made all comers welcome, and under these protections the Chinese\r\nin considerable numbers had made their lodgment upon our soil.\r\n\r\nThe Burlingame treaty undertakes to deal with this situation, and its\r\nfifth and sixth articles embrace its most important provisions in this\r\nregard and the main stipulations in which the Chinese Government has\r\nsecured an obligatory protection of its subjects within our territory.\r\nThey read as follows:\r\n\r\n  ART. V. The United States of America and the Emperor of China\r\n  cordially recognize the inherent and inalienable right of man to\r\n  change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of\r\n  the free migration and emigration of their citizens and subjects\r\n  respectively from the one country to the other for purposes of\r\n  curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents. The high contracting\r\n  parties therefore join in reprobating any other than an entirely\r\n  voluntary emigration for these purposes. They consequently agree to\r\n  pass laws making it a penal offense for a citizen of the United States\r\n  or Chinese subjects to take Chinese subjects either to the United\r\n  States or to any other foreign country, or for a Chinese subject or\r\n  citizen of the United States to take citizens of the United States\r\n  to China or to any other foreign country, without their free and\r\n  voluntary consent, respectively.\r\n\r\n  ART. VI. Citizens of the United States visiting or residing in China\r\n  shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, or exemptions in respect\r\n  to travel or residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or\r\n  subjects of the most favored nation, and, reciprocally, Chinese\r\n  subjects visiting or residing in the United States shall enjoy the\r\n  same privileges, immunities, and exemptions in respect to travel or\r\n  residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the\r\n  most favored nation. But nothing herein contained shall be held to\r\n  confer naturalization upon citizens of the United States in China,\r\n  nor upon the subjects of China in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn examination of these two articles in the light of the experience\r\nthen influential in suggesting their \"necessity\" will show that the\r\nfifth article was framed in hostility to what seemed the principal\r\nmischief to be guarded against, to wit, the introduction of Chinese\r\nlaborers by methods which should have the character of a forced and\r\nservile importation, and not of a voluntary emigration of freemen\r\nseeking our shores upon motives and in a manner consonant with the\r\nsystem of our institutions and approved by the experience of the\r\nnation. Unquestionably the adhesion of the Government of China to\r\nthese liberal principles of freedom in emigration, with which we were\r\nso familiar and with which we were so well satisfied, was a great\r\nadvance toward opening that Empire to our civilization and religion,\r\nand gave promise in the future of greater and greater practical\r\nresults in the diffusion throughout that great population of our arts\r\nand industries, our manufactures, our material improvements, and the\r\nsentiments of government and religion which seem to us so important to\r\nthe welfare of mankind. The first clause of this article secures this\r\nacceptance by China of the American doctrines of free migration to and\r\nfro among the peoples and races of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe second clause, however, in its reprobation of \"any other than an\r\nentirely voluntary emigration\" by both the high contracting parties,\r\nand in the reciprocal obligations whereby we secured the solemn and\r\nunqualified engagement on the part of the Government of China \"to pass\r\nlaws making it a penal offense for a citizen of the United States or\r\nChinese subjects to take Chinese subjects either to the United States\r\nor to any other foreign country without their free and voluntary\r\nconsent,\" constitutes the great force and value of this article. Its\r\nimportance both in principle and in its practical service toward our\r\nprotection against servile importation in the guise of immigration can\r\nnot be overestimated. It commits the Chinese Government to active and\r\nefficient measures to suppress this iniquitous system, where those\r\nmeasures are most necessary and can be most effectual. It gives to\r\nthis Government the footing of a treaty right to such measures and\r\nthe means and opportunity of insisting upon their adoption and\r\nof complaint and resentment at their neglect. The fifth article,\r\ntherefore, if it fall short of what the pressure of the later\r\nexperience of our Pacific States may urge upon the attention of this\r\nGovernment as essential to the public welfare, seems to be in the\r\nright direction and to contain important advantages which once\r\nrelinquished can not be easily recovered.\r\n\r\nThe second topic which interested the two Governments under the actual\r\ncondition of things which prompted the Burlingame treaty was adequate\r\nprotection, under the solemn and definite guaranties of a treaty,\r\nof the Chinese already in this country and those who should seek\r\nour shores. This was the object, and forms the subject of the sixth\r\narticle, by whose reciprocal engagement the citizens and subjects of\r\nthe two Governments, respectively, visiting or residing in the\r\ncountry of the other are secured the same privileges, immunities,\r\nor exemptions there enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the most\r\nfavored nations. The treaty of 1858, to which these articles are made\r\nsupplemental, provides for a great amount of privilege and protection,\r\nboth of person and property, to American citizens in China, but it is\r\nupon this sixth article that the main body of the treaty rights\r\nand securities of the Chinese already in this country depends. Its\r\nabrogation, were the rest of the treaty left in force, would leave\r\nthem to such treatment as we should voluntarily accord them by our\r\nlaws and customs. Any treaty obligation would be wanting to restrain\r\nour liberty of action toward them, or to measure or sustain the right\r\nof the Chinese Government to complaint or redress in their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of ten years since the negotiation of the Burlingame treaty\r\nhas exhibited to the notice of the Chinese Government, as well as to\r\nour own people, the working of this experiment of immigration in great\r\nnumbers of Chinese laborers to this country, and their maintenance\r\nhere of all the traits of race, religion, manners, and customs,\r\nhabitations, mode of life, segregation here, and the keeping up of\r\nthe ties of their original home, which stamp them as strangers and\r\nsojourners, and not as incorporated elements of our national life and\r\ngrowth. This experience may naturally suggest the reconsideration of\r\nthe subject as dealt with by the Burlingame treaty, and may properly\r\nbecome the occasion of more and circumspect recognition, in renewed\r\nnegotiations, of the difficulties surrounding this political and\r\nsocial problem. It may well be that, to the apprehension of the\r\nChinese Government no less than our own, the simple provisions of the\r\nBurlingame treaty may need to be replaced by more careful methods,\r\nsecuring the Chinese and ourselves against a larger and more rapid\r\ninfusion of this foreign race than our system of industry and\r\nsociety can take up and assimilate with ease and safety. This ancient\r\nGovernment, ruling a polite and sensitive people, distinguished by\r\na high sense of national pride, may properly desire an adjustment of\r\ntheir relations with us which would in all things confirm and in no\r\ndegree endanger the permanent peace and amity and the growing commerce\r\nand prosperity which it has been the object and the effect of our\r\nexisting treaties to cherish and perpetuate.\r\n\r\nI regard the very grave discontents of the people of the Pacific\r\nStates with the present working of the Chinese immigration, and their\r\nstill graver apprehensions therefrom in the future, as deserving\r\nthe most serious attention of the people of the whole country and a\r\nsolicitous interest on the part of Congress and the Executive. If this\r\nwere not my own judgment, the passage of this bill by both Houses of\r\nCongress would impress upon me the seriousness of the situation, when\r\na majority of the representatives of the people of the whole country\r\nhad thought fit to justify so serious a measure of relief.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Congress to terminate a treaty with a foreign power\r\nby expressing the will of the nation no longer to adhere to it is\r\nas free from controversy under our Constitution as is the further\r\nproposition that the power of making new treaties or modifying\r\nexisting treaties is not lodged by the Constitution in Congress, but\r\nin the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, as\r\nshown by the concurrence of two-thirds of that body. A denunciation of\r\na treaty by any government is confessedly justifiable only upon some\r\nreason both of the highest justice and of the highest necessity. The\r\naction of Congress in the matter of the French treaties in 1798, if\r\nit be regarded as an abrogation by this nation of a subsisting treaty,\r\nstrongly illustrates the character and degree of justification which\r\nwas then thought suitable to such a proceeding. The preamble of the\r\nact recites that the--\r\n\r\n  Treaties concluded between the United States and France have been\r\n  repeatedly violated on the part of the French Government, and the\r\n  just claims of the United States for reparation of the injuries\r\n  so committed have been refused, and their attempts to negotiate an\r\n  amicable adjustment of all complaints between the two nations have\r\n  been repelled with indignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that--\r\n\r\n  Under authority of the French Government there is yet pursued against\r\n  the United States a system of predatory violence, infracting the said\r\n  treaties and hostile to the rights of a free and independent nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enactment, as a logical consequence of these recited facts,\r\ndeclares--\r\n\r\n  That the United States are of right freed and exonerated from the\r\n  stipulations of the treaties and of the consular convention heretofore\r\n  concluded between the United States and France, and that the same\r\n  shall not henceforth be regarded as legally obligatory on the\r\n  Government or citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Government shows no other instance of an abrogation\r\nof a treaty by Congress.\r\n\r\nInstances have sometimes occurred where the ordinary legislation\r\nof Congress has, by its conflict with some treaty obligation of the\r\nGovernment toward a foreign power, taken effect as an _infraction_\r\nof the treaty, and been judicially declared to be operative to that\r\nresult; but neither such legislation nor such judicial sanction of the\r\nsame has been regarded as an _abrogation_, even for the moment, of\r\nthe treaty. On the contrary, the treaty in such case still subsists\r\nbetween the governments, and the casual infraction is repaired by\r\nappropriate satisfaction in maintenance of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe bill before me does not enjoin upon the President the abrogation\r\nof the entire Burlingame treaty, much less of the principal treaty of\r\nwhich it is made the supplement. As the power of modifying an existing\r\ntreaty, whether by adding or striking out provisions, is a part of\r\nthe treaty-making power under the Constitution, its exercise is not\r\ncompetent for Congress, nor would the assent of China to this partial\r\nabrogation of the treaty make the action of Congress in thus procuring\r\nan amendment of a treaty a competent exercise of authority under the\r\nConstitution. The importance, however, of this special consideration\r\nseems superseded by the principle that a denunciation of a part of a\r\ntreaty not made by the terms of the treaty itself separable from\r\nthe rest is a denunciation of the whole treaty. As the other high\r\ncontracting party has entered into no treaty obligations except such\r\nas include the part denounced, the denunciation by one party of the\r\npart necessarily liberates the other party from the whole treaty.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that, whatever urgency might in any quarter or by any\r\ninterest be supposed to require an instant suppression of further\r\nimmigration from China, no reasons can require the immediate\r\nwithdrawal of our treaty protection of the Chinese already in this\r\ncountry, and no circumstances can tolerate an exposure of our citizens\r\nin China, merchants or missionaries, to the consequences of so sudden\r\nan abrogation of their treaty protection. Fortunately, however, the\r\nactual recession in the flow of the emigration from China to the\r\nPacific Coast, shown by trustworthy statistics, relieves us from any\r\napprehension that the treatment of the subject in the proper course of\r\ndiplomatic negotiations will introduce any new features of discontent\r\nor disturbance among the communities directly affected. Were such\r\ndelay fraught with more inconveniences than have ever been suggested\r\nby the interests most earnest in promoting this legislation, I can not\r\nbut regard the summary disturbance of our existing treaties with\r\nChina as greatly more inconvenient to much wider and more permanent\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\nI have no occasion to insist upon the more general considerations of\r\ninterest and duty which sacredly guard the faith of the nation, in\r\nwhatever form of obligation it may have been given. These sentiments\r\nanimate the deliberations of Congress and pervade the minds of our\r\nwhole people. Our history gives little occasion for any reproach in\r\nthis regard; and in asking the renewed attention of Congress to this\r\nbill I am persuaded that their action will maintain the public duty\r\nand the public honor.\r\n\r\nR.B.

Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, do, by virtue of the power to this end in me vested by the\r\nConstitution, convene both Houses of Congress to assemble at their\r\nrespective chambers at 12 o'clock noon on Tuesday, the 18th day of\r\nMarch instant, then and there to consider and determine such measures\r\nas in their wisdom their duty and the welfare of the people may seem\r\nto demand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 4th day of March, A.D. 1879, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred\r\nand third.\r\n\r\nR.B.

The\r\nreport of the board was made in March last, but the official record of\r\nthe proceedings did not reach me until the 3d instant.\r\n\r\nI have given to this report such examination as satisfies me that\r\nI ought to lay the proceedings and conclusions of the board before\r\nCongress. As I am without power, in the absence of legislation, to act\r\nupon the recommendations of the report further than by submitting the\r\nsame to Congress, the proceedings and conclusions of the board are\r\ntransmitted for the information of Congress and such action as in your\r\nwisdom shall seem expedient and just.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 13, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in compliance with the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of the 29th ultimo, a report of the Secretary of\r\nState relative to the steps taken by this Government to promote the\r\nestablishment of an interoceanic canal across or near the Isthmus of\r\nDarien.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 30, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe bill making provision for the payment of the fees of United States\r\nmarshals and their general deputies, which I have this day returned\r\nto the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with my\r\nobjections,[27] having upon its reconsideration by that body failed\r\nto become a law, I respectfully call your attention to the immediate\r\nnecessity of making some adequate provision for the due and efficient\r\nexecution by the marshals and deputy marshals of the United States of\r\nthe constant and important duties enjoined upon them by the existing\r\nlaws. All appropriations to provide for the performance of these\r\nindispensable duties expire to-day. Under the laws prohibiting public\r\nofficers from involving the Government in contract liabilities beyond\r\nactual appropriations, it is apparent that the means at the disposal\r\nof the executive department for executing the laws through the\r\nregular ministerial officers will after to-day be left inadequate. The\r\nsuspension of these necessary functions in the orderly administration\r\nof the first duties of government for the shortest period is\r\ninconsistent with the public interests, and at any moment may prove\r\ninconsistent with the public safety.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to look without grave concern upon a state of\r\nthings which will leave the public service thus unprovided for and\r\nthe public interests thus unprotected, and I earnestly urge upon your\r\nattention the necessity of making immediate appropriations for the\r\nmaintenance of the service of the marshals and deputy marshals for the\r\nfiscal year which commences to-morrow.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See pp. 545-547.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 1, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 28th June, 1879,\r\nrequesting a copy of any correspondence which may have passed between\r\nthe Department of State and the Republic of Mexico in regard to the\r\nproposed Austin-Topolovampo Railroad survey across the northern States\r\nof that country, I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of\r\nState upon the subject.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 29, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have maturely considered the important questions presented by the\r\nbill entitled \"An act making appropriations for the support of\r\nthe Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and for other\r\npurposes,\" and I now return it to the House of Representatives, in\r\nwhich it originated, with my objections to its approval.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides in the usual form for the appropriations required\r\nfor the support of the Army during the next fiscal year. If it\r\ncontained no other provisions, it would receive my prompt approval. It\r\nincludes, however, further legislation, which, attached, as it is, to\r\nappropriations which are requisite for the efficient performance\r\nof some of the most necessary duties of the Government, involves\r\nquestions of the gravest character. The sixth section of the bill is\r\namendatory of the statute now in force in regard to the authority of\r\npersons in the civil, military, and naval service of the United States\r\n\"at the place where any general or special election is held in any\r\nState.\" This statute was adopted February 25, 1865, after a protracted\r\ndebate in the Senate, and almost without opposition in the House\r\nof Representatives, by the concurrent votes of both of the leading\r\npolitical parties of the country, and became a law by the approval of\r\nPresident Lincoln. It was reenacted in 1874 in the Revised Statutes of\r\nthe United States, sections 2002 and 5528, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2002. No military or naval officer, or other person\r\n  engaged in the civil, military, or naval service of the United\r\n  States, shall order, bring, keep, or have under his authority\r\n  or control any troops or armed men at the place where any\r\n  general or special election is held in any State, unless it be\r\n  necessary to repel the armed enemies of the United States or\r\n  to keep the peace at the polls.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5528. Every officer of the Army or Navy, or other person\r\n  in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States,\r\n  who orders, brings, keeps, or has under his authority or\r\n  control any troops or armed men at any place where a general\r\n  or special election is held in any State, unless such force\r\n  be necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States or\r\n  to keep the peace at the polls, shall be fined not more than\r\n  $5,000 and surfer imprisonment at hard labor not less than\r\n  three months nor more than five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amendment proposed to this statute in the bill before me omits\r\nfrom both of the foregoing sections the words \"or to keep the peace\r\nat the polls,\" The effect of the adoption of this amendment may be\r\nconsidered--\r\n\r\nFirst. Upon the right of the United States Government to use military\r\nforce to keep the peace at the elections for Members of Congress; and\r\n\r\nSecond. Upon the right of the Government, by civil authority, to\r\nprotect these elections from violence and fraud.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sections of the statute above quoted, the following\r\nprovisions of law relating to the use of the military power at the\r\nelections are now in force:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2003. No officer of the Army or Navy of the United States\r\n  shall prescribe or fix, or attempt to prescribe or fix, by\r\n  proclamation, order, or otherwise, the qualifications of\r\n  voters in any State, or in any manner interfere with the\r\n  freedom of any election in any State, or with the exercise of\r\n  the free right of suffrage in any State.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5529. Every officer or other person in the military or\r\n  naval service who, by force, threat, intimidation, order,\r\n  advice, or otherwise, prevents, or attempts to prevent, any\r\n  qualified voter of any State from freely exercising the right\r\n  of suffrage at any general or special election in such State\r\n  shall be fined not more than $5,000 and imprisoned at hard\r\n  labor not more than five years.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5530. Every officer of the Army or Navy who prescribes\r\n  or fixes, or attempts to prescribe or fix, whether by\r\n  proclamation, order, or otherwise, the qualifications of\r\n  voters at any election in any State shall be punished as\r\n  provided in the preceding section.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5531. Every officer or other person in the military or\r\n  naval service who, by force, threat, intimidation, order, or\r\n  otherwise, compels, or attempts to compel, any officer holding\r\n  an election in any State to receive a vote from a person not\r\n  legally qualified to vote, or who imposes, or attempts to\r\n  impose, any regulations for conducting any general or special\r\n  election in a State different from those prescribed by law, or\r\n  who interferes in any manner with any officer of an election\r\n  in the discharge of his duty, shall be punished as provided in\r\n  section 5529.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5532. Every person convicted of any of the offenses\r\n  specified in the five preceding sections shall, in addition to\r\n  the punishments therein severally prescribed, be disqualified\r\n  from holding any office of honor, profit, or trust under\r\n  the United States; but nothing in those sections shall be\r\n  construed to prevent any officer, soldier, sailor, or marine\r\n  from exercising the right of suffrage in any election district\r\n  to which he may belong, if otherwise qualified according to\r\n  the laws of the State in which he offers to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing enactments would seem to be sufficient to prevent\r\nmilitary interference with the elections. But the last Congress, to\r\nremove all apprehension of such interference, added to this body of\r\nlaw section 15 of an act entitled \"An act making appropriations for\r\nthe support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, and\r\nfor other purposes,\" approved June 18, 1878, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 15. From and after the passage of this act it shall not\r\n  be lawful to employ any part of the Army of the United States,\r\n  as a _posse comitatus_ or otherwise, for the purpose of\r\n  executing the laws, except in such cases and under such\r\n  circumstances as such employment of said force may be\r\n  expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of\r\n  Congress; and no money appropriated by this act shall be used\r\n  to pay any of the expenses incurred in the employment of any\r\n  troops in violation of this section; and any person willfully\r\n  violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed\r\n  guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be\r\n  punished by fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not\r\n  exceeding two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis act passed the Senate, after full consideration, without a single\r\nvote recorded against it on its final passage, and, by a majority\r\nof more than two-thirds, it was concurred in by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the section quoted was stated in the Senate by one of\r\nits supporters as follows:\r\n\r\n  Therefore I hope, without getting into any controversy about\r\n  the past, but acting wisely for the future, that we shall\r\n  take away the idea that the Army can be used by a general or\r\n  special deputy marshal, or any marshal, merely for election\r\n  purposes, as a posse, ordering them about the polls or\r\n  ordering them anywhere else, when there is an election going\r\n  on, to prevent disorders or to suppress disturbances that\r\n  should be suppressed by the peace officers of the State; or,\r\n  if they must bring others to their aid they should summon the\r\n  unorganized citizens, and not summon the officers and men of\r\n  the Army as _posse comitatus_ to quell disorders, and thus\r\n  get up a feeling which will be disastrous to peace among the\r\n  people of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives the object of the act of 1878 was\r\nstated by the gentleman who had it in charge in similar terms. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  But these are all minor points and insignificant questions\r\n  compared with the great principle which was incorporated by\r\n  the House in the bill in reference to the use of the Army\r\n  in time of peace. The Senate had already conceded what they\r\n  called and what we might accept as the principle, but they\r\n  had stricken out the penalty, and had stricken out the word\r\n  \"_expressly_\" so that the Army might be used in all cases\r\n  where _implied_ authority might be inferred. The House\r\n  committee planted themselves firmly upon the doctrine that\r\n  rather than yield this fundamental principle, for which for\r\n  three years this House had struggled, they would allow\r\n  the bill to fail, notwithstanding the reforms which we had\r\n  secured, regarding these reforms as of but little consequence\r\n  alongside the great principle that the Army of the United\r\n  States, in time of peace, should be under the control of\r\n  Congress and obedient to its laws. After a long and protracted\r\n  negotiation, the Senate committee have conceded that principle\r\n  in all its length and breadth, including the penalty, which\r\n  the Senate had stricken out. We bring you back, therefore,\r\n  a report, with the alteration of a single word, which the\r\n  lawyers assure me is proper to be made, restoring to this bill\r\n  the principle for which we have contended so long, and which\r\n  is so vital to secure the rights and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Thus have we this day secured to the people of this country\r\n  the same great protection against a standing army which cost\r\n  a struggle of two hundred years for the Commons of England to\r\n  secure for the British people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this brief review of the subject it sufficiently appears that\r\nunder existing laws there can be no military interference with the\r\nelections. No case of such interference has, in fact, occurred since\r\nthe passage of the act last referred to. No soldier of the United\r\nStates has appeared under orders at any place of election in any\r\nState. No complaint even of the presence of United States troops has\r\nbeen made in any quarter. It may therefore be confidently stated\r\nthat there is no necessity for the enactment of section 6 of the bill\r\nbefore me to prevent military interference with the elections. The\r\nlaws already in force are all that is required for that end.\r\n\r\nBut that part of section 6 of this bill which is significant and\r\nvitally important is the clause which, if adopted, will deprive the\r\ncivil authorities of the United States of all power to keep the peace\r\nat the Congressional elections. The Congressional elections in every\r\ndistrict, in a very important sense, are justly a matter of political\r\ninterest and concern throughout the whole country. Each State, every\r\npolitical party, is entitled to the share of power which is conferred\r\nby the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every\r\ncitizen possessing the qualifications prescribed by law to cast one\r\nunintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long\r\nas the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are\r\ncommon and equal, practically as well as formally, submission to the\r\nresults of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and\r\nall the departments of Government will feel the true vigor of the\r\npopular will thus expressed.\r\n\r\nTwo provisions of the Constitution authorize legislation by Congress\r\nfor the regulation of the Congressional elections.\r\n\r\nSection 4 of Article I of the Constitution declares--\r\n\r\n  The times, places, and manner of holding elections for\r\n  Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State\r\n  by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time,\r\n  by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the\r\n  places of choosing Senators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth amendment of the Constitution is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote\r\n  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by\r\n  any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of\r\n  servitude.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article\r\n  by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has held that this amendment invests the citizens of\r\nthe United States with a new constitutional right which is within\r\nthe protecting power of Congress. That right the court declares to\r\nbe exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of\r\nservitude. The power of Congress to protect this right by appropriate\r\nlegislation is expressly affirmed by the court.\r\n\r\nNational legislation to provide safeguards for free and honest\r\nelections is necessary, as experience has shown, not only to secure\r\nthe right to vote to the enfranchised race at the South, but also to\r\nprevent fraudulent voting in the large cities of the North. Congress\r\nhas therefore exercised the power conferred by the Constitution, and\r\nhas enacted certain laws to prevent discriminations on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude, and to punish fraud,\r\nviolence, and intimidation at Federal elections. Attention is called\r\nto the following sections of the Revised Statutes of the United\r\nStates, viz:\r\n\r\nSection 2004, which guarantees to all citizens the right to vote,\r\nwithout distinction on account of race, color, or previous condition\r\nof servitude.\r\n\r\nSections 2005 and 2006, which guarantee to all citizens equal\r\nopportunity, without discrimination, to perform all the acts required\r\nby law as a prerequisite or qualification for voting.\r\n\r\nSection 2022, which authorizes the United States marshal and\r\nhis deputies to keep the peace and preserve order at the Federal\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nSection 2024, which expressly authorizes the United States marshal\r\nand his deputies to summon a _posse comitatus_ whenever they or any of\r\nthem are forcibly resisted in the execution of their duties under the\r\nlaw or are prevented from executing such duties by violence.\r\n\r\nSection 5522, which provides for the punishment of the crime of\r\ninterfering with the supervisors of elections and deputy marshals in\r\nthe discharge of their duties at the elections of Representatives in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the laws on this subject which it is the duty of\r\nthe executive department of the Government to enforce. The intent and\r\neffect of the sixth section of this bill is to prohibit all the civil\r\nofficers of the United States, under penalty of fine and imprisonment,\r\nfrom employing any adequate civil force for this purpose at the place\r\nwhere their enforcement is most necessary, namely, at the places\r\nwhere the Congressional elections are held. Among the most valuable\r\nenactments to which I have referred are those which protect the\r\nsupervisors of Federal elections in the discharge of their duties at\r\nthe polls. If the proposed legislation should become the law, there\r\nwill be no power vested in any officer of the Government to protect\r\nfrom violence the officers of the United States engaged in the\r\ndischarge of their duties. Their rights and duties under the law will\r\nremain, but the National Government will be powerless to enforce its\r\nown statutes. The States may employ both military and civil power to\r\nkeep the peace and to enforce the laws at State elections. It is\r\nnow proposed to deny to the United States even the necessary civil\r\nauthority to protect the national elections. No sufficient reason has\r\nbeen given for this discrimination in favor of the State and against\r\nthe national authority. If well-founded objections exist against the\r\npresent national election laws, all good citizens should unite in\r\ntheir amendment. The laws providing the safeguards of the elections\r\nshould be impartial, just, and efficient. They should, if possible,\r\nbe so nonpartisan and fair in their operation that the minority--the\r\nparty out of power--will have no just grounds to complain. The present\r\nlaws have in practice unquestionably conduced to the prevention of\r\nfraud and violence at the elections. In several of the States members\r\nof different political parties have applied for the safeguards which\r\nthey furnish. It is the right and duty of the National Government to\r\nenact and enforce laws which will secure free and fair Congressional\r\nelections. The laws now in force should not be repealed except in\r\nconnection with the enactment of measures which will better accomplish\r\nthat important end. Believing that section 6 of the bill before me\r\nwill weaken, if it does not altogether take away, the power of the\r\nNational Government to protect the Federal elections by the civil\r\nauthorities, I am forced to the conclusion that it ought not to\r\nreceive my approval.\r\n\r\nThis section is, however, not presented to me as a separate and\r\nindependent measure, but is, as has been stated, attached to the bill\r\nmaking the usual annual appropriations for the support of the Army. It\r\nmakes a vital change in the election laws of the country, which is in\r\nno way connected with the use of the Army. It prohibits, under heavy\r\npenalties, any person engaged in the civil service of the United\r\nStates from having any force at the place of any election, prepared to\r\npreserve order, to make arrests, to keep the peace, or in any manner\r\nto enforce the laws. This is altogether foreign to the purpose of\r\nan Army appropriation bill. The practice of tacking to appropriation\r\nbills measures not pertinent to such bills did not prevail until more\r\nthan forty years after the adoption of the Constitution. It has become\r\na common practice. All parties when in power have adopted it. Many\r\nabuses and great waste of public money have in this way crept into\r\nappropriation bills. The public opinion of the country is against it.\r\nThe States which have recently adopted constitutions have generally\r\nprovided a remedy for the evil by enacting that no law shall contain\r\nmore than one subject, which shall be plainly expressed in its\r\ntitle. The constitutions of more than half of the States contain\r\nsubstantially this provision. The public welfare will be promoted in\r\nmany ways by a return to the early practice of the Government and to\r\nthe true principle of legislation, which requires that every measure\r\nshall stand or fall according to its own merits. If it were understood\r\nthat to attach to an appropriation bill a measure irrelevant to the\r\ngeneral object of the bill would imperil and probably prevent its\r\nfinal passage and approval, a valuable reform in the parliamentary\r\npractice of Congress would be accomplished. The best justification\r\nthat has been offered for attaching irrelevant riders to appropriation\r\nbills is that it is done for convenience sake, to facilitate the\r\npassage of measures which are deemed expedient by all the branches\r\nof Government which participate in legislation. It can not be claimed\r\nthat there is any such reason for attaching this amendment of the\r\nelection laws to the Army appropriation bill. The history of the\r\nmeasure contradicts this assumption. A majority of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in the last Congress was in favor of section 6 of this\r\nbill. It was known that a majority of the Senate was opposed to\r\nit, and that as a separate measure it could not be adopted. It was\r\nattached to the Army appropriation bill to compel the Senate to\r\nassent to it. It was plainly announced to the Senate that the Army\r\nappropriation bill would not be allowed to pass unless the proposed\r\namendments of the election laws were adopted with it. The Senate\r\nrefused to assent to the bill on account of this irrelevant section.\r\nCongress thereupon adjourned without passing an appropriation bill for\r\nthe Army, and the present extra session of the Forty-sixth Congress\r\nbecame necessary to furnish the means to carry on the Government.\r\n\r\nThe ground upon which the action of the House of Representatives is\r\ndefended has been distinctly stated by many of its advocates. A week\r\nbefore the close of the last session of Congress the doctrine in\r\nquestion was stated by one of its ablest defenders as follows:\r\n\r\n  It is our duty to repeal these laws. It is not worth while\r\n  to attempt the repeal except upon an appropriation bill.\r\n  The Republican Senate would not agree to nor the Republican\r\n  President sign a bill for such repeal. Whatever objection to\r\n  legislation upon appropriation bills may be made in ordinary\r\n  cases does not apply where free elections and the liberty of\r\n  the citizens are concerned. * * * We have the power to vote\r\n  money; let us annex conditions to it, and insist upon the\r\n  redress of grievances.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy another distinguished member of the House it was said:\r\n\r\n  The right of the Representatives of the people to withhold\r\n  supplies is as old as English liberty. History records\r\n  numerous instances where the Commons, feeling that the people\r\n  were oppressed by laws that the Lords would not consent\r\n  to repeal by the ordinary methods of legislation, obtained\r\n  redress at last by refusing appropriations unless accompanied\r\n  by relief measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a question of the gravest magnitude, and new in this country, was\r\nraised by this course of proceeding, was fully recognized also by its\r\ndefenders in the Senate. It was said by a distinguished Senator:\r\n\r\n  Perhaps no greater question, in the form we are brought to\r\n  consider it, was ever considered by the American Congress\r\n  in time of peace; for it involves not merely the merits or\r\n  demerits of the laws which the House bill proposes to repeal,\r\n  but involves the rights, the privileges, the powers, the\r\n  duties of the two branches of Congress and of the President\r\n  of the United States. It is a vast question; it is a question\r\n  whose importance can scarcely be estimated; it is a question\r\n  that never yet has been brought so sharply before the American\r\n  Congress and the American people as it may be now. It is\r\n  a question which sooner or later must be decided, and the\r\n  decision must determine what are the powers of the House of\r\n  Representatives under the Constitution, and what is the duty\r\n  of that House in the view of the framers of that Constitution,\r\n  according to its letter and its spirit.\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, I should approach this question, if I were in\r\n  the best possible condition to speak and to argue it, with\r\n  very grave diffidence, and certainly with the utmost anxiety;\r\n  for no one can think of it as long and as carefully as I have\r\n  thought of it without seeing that we are at the beginning,\r\n  perhaps, of a struggle that may last as long in this country\r\n  as a similar struggle lasted in what we are accustomed to call\r\n  the mother land. There the struggle lasted for two centuries\r\n  before it was ultimately decided. It is not likely to last so\r\n  long here, but it may last until every man in this chamber is\r\n  in his grave. It is the question whether or no the House of\r\n  Representatives has a right to say, \"We will grant supplies\r\n  only upon condition that grievances are redressed. We are\r\n  the representatives of the taxpayers of the Republic. We, the\r\n  House of Representatives, alone have the right to originate\r\n  money bills. We, the House of Representatives, have alone the\r\n  right to originate bills which grant the money of the people.\r\n  The Senate represents States; we represent the taxpayers\r\n  of the Republic. We, therefore, by the very terms of the\r\n  Constitution, are charged with the duty of originating the\r\n  bills which grant the money of the people. We claim the right,\r\n  which the House of Commons in England established after two\r\n  centuries of contest, to say that we will not grant the money\r\n  of the people unless there is a redress of grievances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the assembling of this Congress, in pursuance of a call for\r\nan extra session, which was made necessary by the failure of the\r\nForty-fifth Congress to make the needful appropriations for the\r\nsupport of the Government, the question was presented whether the\r\nattempt made in the last Congress to ingraft by construction a new\r\nprinciple upon the Constitution should be persisted in or not. This\r\nCongress has ample opportunity and time to pass the appropriation\r\nbills, and also to enact any political measures which may be\r\ndetermined upon in separate bills by the usual and orderly methods\r\nof proceeding. But the majority of both Houses have deemed it wise to\r\nadhere to the principles asserted and maintained in the last Congress\r\nby the majority of the House of Representatives. That principle is\r\nthat the House of Representatives has the sole right to originate\r\nbills for raising revenue, and therefore has the right to withhold\r\nappropriations upon which the existence of the Government may depend\r\nunless the Senate and the President shall give their assent to any\r\nlegislation which the House may see fit to attach to appropriation\r\nbills. To establish this principle is to make a radical, dangerous,\r\nand unconstitutional change in the character of our institutions. The\r\nvarious departments of the Government and the Army and the Navy\r\nare established by the Constitution or by laws passed in pursuance\r\nthereof. Their duties are clearly defined and their support is\r\ncarefully provided for by law. The money required for this purpose has\r\nbeen collected from the people and is now in the Treasury, ready to\r\nbe paid out as soon as the appropriation bills are passed. Whether\r\nappropriations are made or not, the collection of the taxes will go\r\non. The public money will accumulate in the Treasury. It was not the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution that any single branch of\r\nthe Government should have the power to dictate conditions upon\r\nwhich this treasure should be applied to the purpose for which it was\r\ncollected. Any such intention, if it had been entertained, would have\r\nbeen plainly expressed in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThat a majority of the Senate now concurs in the claim of the House\r\nadds to the gravity of the situation, but does not alter the\r\nquestion at issue. The new doctrine, if maintained, will result in\r\na consolidation of unchecked and despotic power in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. A bare majority of the House will become the\r\nGovernment. The Executive will no longer be what the framers of\r\nthe Constitution intended--an equal and independent branch of the\r\nGovernment. It is clearly the constitutional duty of the President to\r\nexercise his discretion and judgment upon all bills presented to him\r\nwithout constraint or duress from any other branch of the Government.\r\nTo say that a majority of either or both of the Houses of Congress may\r\ninsist upon the approval of a bill under the penalty of stopping all\r\nof the operations of the Government for want of the necessary supplies\r\nis to deny to the Executive that share of the legislative power which\r\nis plainly conferred by the second section of the seventh article\r\nof the Constitution. It strikes from the Constitution the qualified\r\nnegative of the President. It is said that this should be done\r\nbecause it is the peculiar function of the House of Representatives to\r\nrepresent the will of the people. But no single branch or department\r\nof the Government has exclusive authority to speak for the American\r\npeople. The most authentic and solemn expression of their will\r\nis contained in the Constitution of the United States. By that\r\nConstitution they have ordained and established a Government whose\r\npowers are distributed among coordinate branches, which, as far as\r\npossible consistently with a harmonious cooperation, are absolutely\r\nindependent of each other. The people of this country are unwilling to\r\nsee the supremacy of the Constitution replaced by the omnipotence of\r\nany one department of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of this bill into a law will establish a precedent which\r\nwill tend to destroy the equal independence of the several branches\r\nof the Government. Its principle places not merely the Senate and the\r\nExecutive, but the judiciary also, under the coercive dictation of\r\nthe House. The House alone will be the judge of what constitutes a\r\ngrievance, and also of the means and measure of redress. An act of\r\nCongress to protect elections is now the grievance complained of; but\r\nthe House may on the same principle determine that any other act of\r\nCongress, a treaty made by the President with the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate, a nomination or appointment to office, or that a\r\ndecision or opinion of the Supreme Court is a grievance, and that the\r\nmeasure of redress is to withhold the appropriations required for the\r\nsupport of the offending branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nBelieving that this bill is a dangerous violation of the spirit and\r\nmeaning of the Constitution, I am compelled to return it to the House\r\nin which it originated without my approval. The qualified negative\r\nwith which the Constitution invests the President is a trust that\r\ninvolves a duty which he can not decline to perform. With a firm and\r\nconscientious purpose to do what I can to preserve unimpaired the\r\nconstitutional powers and equal independence, not merely of the\r\nExecutive, but of every branch of the Government, which will be\r\nimperiled by the adoption of the principle of this bill, I desire\r\nearnestly to urge upon the House of Representatives a return to the\r\nwise and wholesome usage of the earlier days of the Republic, which\r\nexcluded from appropriation bills all irrelevant legislation. By\r\nthis course you will inaugurate an important reform in the method of\r\nCongressional legislation; your action will be in harmony with the\r\nfundamental principles of the Constitution and the patriotic sentiment\r\nof nationality which is their firm support, and you will restore to\r\nthe country that feeling of confidence and security and the\r\nrepose which are so essential to the prosperity of all of our\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter a careful consideration of the bill entitled \"An act to prohibit\r\nmilitary interference at elections,\" I return it to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which it originated, with the following objections\r\nto its approval:\r\n\r\nIn the communication sent to the House of Representatives on the 29th\r\nof last month, returning to the House without my approval the bill\r\nentitled \"An act making appropriations for the support of the Army\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and for other purposes,\"\r\nI endeavored to show, by quotations from the statutes of the United\r\nStates now in force and by a brief statement of facts in regard to\r\nrecent elections in the several States, that no additional legislation\r\nwas necessary to prevent interference with the elections by the\r\nmilitary or naval forces of the United States. The fact was presented\r\nin that communication that at the time of the passage of the act of\r\nJune 18, 1878, in relation to the employment of the Army as a _posse\r\ncomitatus_ or otherwise, it was maintained by its friends that it\r\nwould establish a vital and fundamental principle which would secure,\r\nto the people protection against a standing army. The fact was also\r\nreferred to that since the passage of this act Congressional, State,\r\nand municipal elections have been held throughout the Union, and\r\nthat in no instance has complaint been made of the presence of United\r\nStates soldiers at the polls.\r\n\r\nHolding, as I do, the opinion that any military interference whatever\r\nat the polls is contrary to the spirit of our institutions and would\r\ntend to destroy the freedom of elections, and sincerely desiring to\r\nconcur with Congress in all of its measures, it is with very great\r\nregret that I am forced to the conclusion that the bill before me is\r\nnot only unnecessary to prevent such interference, but is a dangerous\r\ndeparture from long-settled and important constitutional principles.\r\n\r\nThe true rule as to the employment of military force at the elections\r\nis not doubtful. No intimidation or coercion should be allowed to\r\ncontrol or influence citizens in the exercise of their right to vote,\r\nwhether it appears in the shape of combinations of evil-disposed\r\npersons, or of armed bodies of the militia of a State, or of the\r\nmilitary force of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe elections should be free from all forcible interference, and, as\r\nfar as practicable, from all apprehensions of such interference.\r\nNo soldiers, either of the Union or of the State militia, should be\r\npresent at the polls to take the place or to perform the duties of the\r\nordinary civil police force. There has been and will be no violation\r\nof this rule under orders from me during this Administration; but\r\nthere should be no denial of the right of the National Government to\r\nemploy its military force on any day and at any place in case such\r\nemployment is necessary to enforce the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe bill before me is as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Be it enacted, etc._, That it shall not be lawful to bring to\r\n  or employ at any place where a general or special election\r\n  is being held in a State any part of the Army or Navy of the\r\n  United States, unless such force be necessary to repel the\r\n  armed enemies of the United States or to enforce section 4,\r\n  Article IV, of the Constitution of the United States and\r\n  the laws made in pursuance thereof, on application of the\r\n  legislature or executive of the State where such force is to\r\n  be used; and so much of all laws as is inconsistent herewith\r\n  is hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the bill exempts from the general prohibition\r\nagainst the employment of military force at the polls two specified\r\ncases. These exceptions recognize and concede the soundness of the\r\nprinciple that military force may properly and constitutionally be\r\nused at the place of elections when such use is necessary to enforce\r\nthe Constitution and the laws; but the excepted cases leave the\r\nprohibition so extensive and far-reaching that its adoption will\r\nseriously impair the efficiency of the executive department of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe first act expressly authorizing the use of military power to\r\nexecute the laws was passed almost as early as the organization of\r\nthe Government under the Constitution, and was approved by President\r\nWashington May 2, 1792. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That whenever the laws\r\n  of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof\r\n  obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be\r\n  suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or\r\n  by the powers vested in the marshals by this act, the same\r\n  being notified to the President of the United States by an\r\n  associate justice or the district judge, it shall be lawful\r\n  for the President of the United States to call forth the\r\n  militia of such State to suppress such combinations and to\r\n  cause the laws to be duly executed. And if the militia of a\r\n  State where such combination may happen shall refuse or be\r\n  insufficient to suppress the same, it shall be lawful for the\r\n  President, if the Legislature of the United States be not in\r\n  session, to call forth and employ such numbers of the militia\r\n  of any other State or States most convenient thereto as may be\r\n  necessary; and the use of militia so to be called forth may be\r\n  continued, if necessary, until the expiration of thirty days\r\n  after the commencement of the ensuing session.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1795 this provision was substantially reenacted in a law which\r\nrepealed the act of 1792. In 1807 the following act became the law by\r\nthe approval of President Jefferson:\r\n\r\n  That in all cases of insurrection or obstruction to the laws,\r\n  either of the United States or of any individual State or\r\n  Territory, where it is lawful for the President of the\r\n  United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of\r\n  suppressing such insurrection or of causing the laws to be\r\n  duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ for the\r\n  same purposes such part of the land or naval force of the\r\n  United States as shall be judged necessary, having first\r\n  observed all the prerequisites of the law in that respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this act it will be seen that the scope of the law of 1795 was\r\nextended so as to authorize the National Government to use not only\r\nthe militia, but the Army and Navy of the United States, in \"causing\r\nthe laws to be duly executed.\"\r\n\r\nThe important provision of the acts of 1792, 1795, and 1807, modified\r\nin its terms from time to time to adapt it to the existing emergency,\r\nremained in force until, by an act approved by President Lincoln July\r\n29, 1861, it was reenacted substantially in the same language in which\r\nit is now found in the Revised Statutes, viz:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5298. Whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions,\r\n  combinations, or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against\r\n  the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall\r\n  become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to\r\n  enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the\r\n  laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it\r\n  shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of\r\n  any or all the States and to employ such parts of the land and\r\n  naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary\r\n  to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United\r\n  States or to suppress such rebellion, in whatever State\r\n  or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be\r\n  forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ancient and fundamental law has been in force from the foundation\r\nof the Government. It is now proposed to abrogate it on certain days\r\nand at certain places. In my judgment no fact has been produced which\r\ntends to show that it ought to be repealed or suspended for a single\r\nhour at any place in any of the States or Territories of the Union.\r\nAll the teachings of experience in the course of our history are in\r\nfavor of sustaining its efficiency unimpaired. On every occasion when\r\nthe supremacy of the Constitution has been resisted and the perpetuity\r\nof our institutions imperiled the principle of this statute, enacted\r\nby the fathers, has enabled the Government of the Union to maintain\r\nits authority and to preserve the integrity of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt the most critical periods of our history my predecessors in the\r\nexecutive office have relied on this great principle. It was on this\r\nprinciple that President Washington suppressed the whisky rebellion in\r\nPennsylvania in 1794.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, on the same principle, President Jefferson broke up the Burr\r\nconspiracy by issuing \"orders for the employment of such force, either\r\nof the regulars or of the militia, and by such proceedings of the\r\ncivil authorities, * * * as might enable them to suppress effectually\r\nthe further progress of the enterprise.\" And it was under the same\r\nauthority that President Jackson crushed nullification in South\r\nCarolina and that President Lincoln issued his call for troops to save\r\nthe Union in 1861. On numerous other occasions of less significance,\r\nunder probably every Administration, and certainly under the present,\r\nthis power has been usefully exerted to enforce the laws, without\r\nobjection by any party in the country, and almost without attracting\r\npublic attention.\r\n\r\nThe great elementary constitutional principle which was the foundation\r\nof the original statute of 1792, and which has been its essence in\r\nthe various forms it has assumed since its first adoption, is that the\r\nGovernment of the United States possesses under the Constitution,\r\nin full measure, the power of self-protection by its own agencies,\r\naltogether independent of State authority, and, if need be, against\r\nthe hostility of State governments. It should remain embodied in\r\nour statutes unimpaired, as it has been from the very origin of the\r\nGovernment. It should be regarded as hardly less valuable or less\r\nsacred than a provision of the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nThere are many other important statutes containing provisions that are\r\nliable to be suspended or annulled at the times and places of\r\nholding elections if the bill before me should become a law. I do not\r\nundertake to furnish a list of them. Many of them--perhaps the most of\r\nthem--have been set forth in the debates on this measure. They relate\r\nto extradition, to crimes against the election laws, to quarantine\r\nregulations, to neutrality, to Indian reservations, to the civil\r\nrights of citizens, and to other subjects. In regard to them all it\r\nmay be safely said that the meaning and effect of this bill is to take\r\nfrom the General Government an important part of its power to enforce\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\nAnother grave objection to the bill is its discrimination in favor\r\nof the State and against the national authority. The presence or\r\nemployment of the Army or Navy of the United States is lawful under\r\nthe terms of this bill at the place where an election is being held in\r\na State to uphold the authority of a State government then and there\r\nin need of such military intervention, but unlawful to uphold the\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States then and there in\r\nneed of such military intervention. Under this bill the presence or\r\nemployment of the Army or Navy of the United States would be lawful\r\nand might be necessary to maintain the conduct of a State election\r\nagainst the domestic violence that would overthrow it, but would be\r\nunlawful to maintain the conduct of a national election against the\r\nsame local violence that would overthrow it. This discrimination has\r\nnever been attempted in any previous legislation by Congress, and is\r\nno more compatible with sound principles of the Constitution or the\r\nnecessary maxims and methods of our system of government on occasions\r\nof elections than at other times. In the early legislation of 1792\r\nand of 1795, by which the militia of the States was the only military\r\npower resorted to for the execution of the constitutional powers\r\nin support of State or national authority, both functions of the\r\nGovernment were put upon the same footing. By the act of 1807 the\r\nemployment of the Army and Navy was authorized for the performance of\r\nboth constitutional duties in the same terms.\r\n\r\nIn all later statutes on the same subject-matter the same measure of\r\nauthority to the Government has been accorded for the performance\r\nof both these duties. No precedent has been found in any previous\r\nlegislation, and no sufficient reason has been given for the\r\ndiscrimination in favor of the State and against the national\r\nauthority which this bill contains.\r\n\r\nUnder the sweeping terms of the bill the National Government is\r\neffectually shut out from the exercise of the right and from the\r\ndischarge of the imperative duty to use its whole executive power\r\nwhenever and wherever required for the enforcement of its laws at the\r\nplaces and times when and where its elections are held. The employment\r\nof its organized armed forces for any such purpose would be an offense\r\nagainst the law unless called for by, and therefore upon permission\r\nof, the authorities of the State in which the occasion arises. What is\r\nthis but the substitution of the discretion of the State governments\r\nfor the discretion of the Government of the United States as to the\r\nperformance of its own duties? In my judgment this is an abandonment\r\nof its obligations by the National Government--a subordination of\r\nnational authority and an intrusion of State supervision over national\r\nduties which amounts, in spirit and tendency, to State supremacy.\r\n\r\nThough I believe that the existing statutes are abundantly adequate\r\nto completely prevent military interference with the elections in the\r\nsense in which the phrase is used in the title of this bill and is\r\nemployed by the people of this country, I shall find no difficulty in\r\nconcurring in any additional legislation limited to that object which\r\ndoes not interfere with the indispensable exercise of the powers of\r\nthe Government under the Constitution and laws.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\nMAY 12, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 29, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter mature consideration of the bill entitled \"An act making\r\nappropriations for the legislative, executive, and judicial expenses\r\nof the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and for\r\nother purposes,\" I herewith return it to the House of Representatives,\r\nin which it originated, with the following objections to its approval:\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the bill is to appropriate the money required to\r\nsupport during the next fiscal year the several civil departments\r\nof the Government. The amount appropriated exceeds in the aggregate\r\n$18,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis money is needed to keep in operation the essential functions of\r\nall the great departments of the Government--legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial. If the bill contained no other provisions, no objection\r\nto its approval would be made. It embraces, however, a number of\r\nclauses, relating to subjects of great general interest, which are\r\nwholly unconnected with the appropriations which it provides for.\r\nThe objections to the practice of tacking general legislation to\r\nappropriation bills, especially when the object is to deprive a\r\ncoordinate branch of the Government of its right to the free exercise\r\nof its own discretion and judgment touching such general legislation,\r\nwere set forth in the special message in relation to House bill No. 1,\r\nwhich was returned to the House of Representatives on the 29th of last\r\nmonth. I regret that the objections which were then expressed to this\r\nmethod of legislation have not seemed to Congress of sufficient weight\r\nto dissuade from this renewed incorporation of general enactments in\r\nan appropriation bill, and that my constitutional duty in respect of\r\nthe general legislation thus placed before me can not be\r\ndischarged without seeming to delay, however briefly, the necessary\r\nappropriations by Congress for the support of the Government. Without\r\nrepeating these objections, I respectfully refer to that message for\r\na statement of my views on the principle maintained in debate by the\r\nadvocates of this bill, viz, that \"to withhold appropriations is a\r\nconstitutional means for the redress\" of what the majority of the\r\nHouse of Representatives may regard as \"a grievance.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill contains the following clauses, viz:\r\n\r\n  _And provided further_, That the following sections of the\r\n  Revised Statutes of the United States, namely, sections 2016,\r\n  2018, and 2020, and all of the succeeding sections of said\r\n  statutes down to and including section 2027, and also section\r\n  5522, be, and the same are hereby, repealed; * * * and that\r\n  all the other sections of the Revised Statutes, and all\r\n  laws and parts of laws authorizing the appointment of\r\n  chief supervisors of elections, special deputy marshals of\r\n  elections, or general deputy marshals having any duties to\r\n  perform in respect to any election, and prescribing their\r\n  duties and powers and allowing them compensation, be, and the\r\n  same are hereby, repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also contains clauses amending sections 2017, 2019, 2028, and 2031\r\nof the Revised Statutes.\r\n\r\nThe sections of the Revised Statutes which the bill, if approved,\r\nwould repeal or amend are part of an act approved May 30, 1870, and\r\namended February 28, 1871, entitled \"An act to enforce the rights of\r\ncitizens of the United States to vote in the several States of\r\nthis Union, and for other purposes.\" All of the provisions of the\r\nabove-named acts which it is proposed in this bill to repeal or modify\r\nrelate to the Congressional elections. The remaining portion of the\r\nlaw, which will continue in force after the enactment of this measure,\r\nis that which provides for the appointment, by a judge of the circuit\r\ncourt of the United States, of two supervisors of election in each\r\nelection district at any Congressional election, on due application\r\nof citizens who desire, in the language of the law, \"to have such\r\nelection _guarded_ and _scrutinized_.\" The duties of the supervisors\r\nwill be to attend at the polls at all Congressional elections, and\r\nto remain after the polls are open until every vote cast has been\r\ncounted; but they will \"have no authority to make arrests or to\r\nperform other duties than to be in the immediate presence of the\r\nofficers holding the election and to witness all their proceedings,\r\nincluding the counting of the votes and the making of a return\r\nthereof.\" The part of the election law which will be repealed by the\r\napproval of this bill includes those sections which give authority\r\nto the supervisors of elections \"to personally scrutinize, count, and\r\ncanvass each ballot,\" and all the sections which confer authority upon\r\nthe United States marshals and deputy marshals in connection with the\r\nCongressional elections. The enactment of this bill will also repeal\r\nsection 5522 of the criminal statutes of the United States, which was\r\nenacted for the protection of United States officers engaged in the\r\ndischarge of their duties at the Congressional elections. This section\r\nprotects supervisors and marshals in the performance of their duties\r\nby making the obstruction or the assaulting of these officers, or\r\nany interference with them, by bribery or solicitation or otherwise,\r\ncrimes against the United States.\r\n\r\nThe true meaning and effect of the proposed legislation are plain. The\r\nsupervisors, with the authority to observe and witness the proceedings\r\nat the Congressional elections, will be left, but there will be no\r\npower to protect them, or to prevent interference with their duties,\r\nor to punish any violation of the law from which their powers are\r\nderived. If this bill is approved, only the shadow of the authority of\r\nthe United States at the national elections will remain; the substance\r\nwill be gone. The supervision of the elections will be reduced to a\r\nmere inspection, without authority on the part of the supervisors to\r\ndo any act whatever to make the election a fair one. All that will be\r\nleft to the supervisors is the permission to have such oversight of\r\nthe elections as political parties are in the habit of exercising\r\nwithout any authority of law, in order to prevent their opponents from\r\nobtaining unfair advantages. The object of the bill is to destroy\r\nany control whatever by the United States over the Congressional\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nThe passage of this bill has been urged upon the ground that the\r\nelection of members of Congress is a matter which concerns the States\r\nalone; that these elections should be controlled exclusively by\r\nthe States; that there are and can be no such elections as national\r\nelections, and that the existing law of the United States regulating\r\nthe Congressional elections is without warrant in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the framers of the Constitution regarded\r\nthe election of members of Congress in every State and in every\r\ndistrict as in a very important sense justly a matter of political\r\ninterest and concern to the whole country. The original provision of\r\nthe Constitution on this subject is as follows (sec. 4, Art. I):\r\n\r\n  The times, places, and manner of holding elections for\r\n  Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State\r\n  by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time,\r\n  by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the\r\n  places of choosing Senators.\r\n\r\n\r\nA further provision has been since added, which is embraced in the\r\nfifteenth amendment. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote\r\n  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by\r\n  any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of\r\n  servitude.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article\r\n  by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the general provision of the Constitution (sec. 4, Art. I)\r\nCongress in 1866 passed a comprehensive law which prescribed full and\r\ndetailed regulations for the election of Senators by the legislatures\r\nof the several States. This law has been in force almost thirteen\r\nyears. In pursuance of it all the members of the present Senate of the\r\nUnited States hold their seats. Its constitutionality is not called\r\nin question. It is confidently believed that no sound argument can\r\nbe made in support of the constitutionality of national regulation of\r\nSenatorial elections which will not show that the elections of members\r\nof the House of Representatives may also be constitutionally regulated\r\nby the national authority.\r\n\r\nThe bill before me itself recognizes the principle that the\r\nCongressional elections are not State elections, but national\r\nelections. It leaves in full force the existing statute under which\r\nsupervisors are still to be appointed by national authority to\r\n\"observe and witness\" the Congressional elections whenever due\r\napplication is made by citizens who desire said elections to be\r\n\"guarded and scrutinized.\" If the power to supervise in any respect\r\nwhatever the Congressional elections exists under section 4, Article\r\nI, of the Constitution, it is a power which, like every other power\r\nbelonging to the Government of the United States, is paramount and\r\nsupreme, and includes the right to employ the necessary means to carry\r\nit into effect.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of the United States which regulate the election of\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives, an essential part of which\r\nit is proposed to repeal by this bill, have been in force about eight\r\nyears. Four Congressional elections have been held under them, two of\r\nwhich were at the Presidential elections of 1872 and 1876. Numerous\r\nprosecutions, trials, and convictions have been had in the courts of\r\nthe United States in all parts of the Union for violations of these\r\nlaws. In no reported case has their constitutionality been called in\r\nquestion by any judge of the courts of the United States. The validity\r\nof these laws is sustained by the uniform course of judicial action\r\nand opinion.\r\n\r\nIf it is urged that the United States election laws are not necessary,\r\nan ample reply is furnished by the history of their origin and of\r\ntheir results. They were especially prompted by the investigation and\r\nexposure of the frauds committed in the city and State of New York\r\nat the elections of 1868. Committees representing both of the leading\r\npolitical parties of the country have submitted reports to the House\r\nof Representatives on the extent of those frauds. A committee of the\r\nFortieth Congress, after a full investigation, reached the conclusion\r\nthat the number of fraudulent votes cast in the city of New York alone\r\nin 1868 was not less than 25,000. A committee of the Forty-fourth\r\nCongress in their report, submitted in 1877, adopted the opinion that\r\nfor every 100 actual voters of the city of New York in 1868 108 votes\r\nwere cast, when in fact the number of lawful votes cast could not\r\nhave exceeded 88 per cent of the actual voters of the city. By this\r\nstatement the number of fraudulent votes at that election in the city\r\nof New York alone was between thirty and forty thousand. These frauds\r\ncompletely reversed the result of the election in the State of New\r\nYork, both as to the choice of governor and State officers and as to\r\nthe choice of electors of President and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates. They attracted the attention of the whole country. It was\r\nplain that if they could be continued and repeated with impunity free\r\ngovernment was impossible. A distinguished Senator, in opposing the\r\npassage of the election laws, declared that he had \"for a long time\r\nbelieved that our form of government was a comparative failure in the\r\nlarger cities.\" To meet these evils and to prevent these crimes the\r\nUnited States laws regulating Congressional elections were enacted.\r\n\r\nThe framers of these laws have not been disappointed in their results.\r\nIn the large cities, under their provisions, the elections have been\r\ncomparatively peaceable, orderly, and honest. Even the opponents of\r\nthese laws have borne testimony to their value and efficiency and to\r\nthe necessity for their enactment. The committee of the Forty-fourth\r\nCongress, composed of members a majority of whom were opposed to these\r\nlaws, in their report on the New York election of 1876, said:\r\n\r\n  The committee would commend to other portions of the country\r\n  and to other cities this remarkable system, developed through\r\n  the agency of both local and Federal authorities acting in\r\n  harmony for an honest purpose. In no portion of the world and\r\n  in no era of time where there has been an expression of the\r\n  popular will through the forms of law has there been a more\r\n  complete and thorough illustration of republican institutions.\r\n  Whatever may have been the previous habit or conduct of\r\n  elections in those cities, or howsoever they may conduct\r\n  themselves in the future, this election of 1876 will stand as\r\n  a monument of what good faith, honest endeavor, legal forms,\r\n  and just authority may do for the protection of the electoral\r\n  franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bill recognizes the authority and duty of the United States\r\nto appoint supervisors to guard and scrutinize the Congressional\r\nelections, but it denies to the Government of the United States all\r\npower to make its supervision effectual. The great body of the people\r\nof all parties want free and fair elections. They do not think that\r\na free election means freedom from the wholesome restraints of law or\r\nthat the place of election should be a sanctuary for lawlessness\r\nand crime. On the day of an election peace and good order are more\r\nnecessary than on any other day of the year. On that day the humblest\r\nand feeblest citizens, the aged and the infirm, should be, and should\r\nhave reason to feel that they are, safe in the exercise of their\r\nmost responsible duty and their most sacred right as members of\r\nsociety--their duty and their right to vote. The constitutional\r\nauthority to regulate the Congressional elections which belongs to the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and which it is necessary to exert\r\nto secure the right to vote to every citizen possessing the requisite\r\nqualifications, ought to be enforced by appropriate legislation.\r\nSo far from public opinion in any part of the country favoring any\r\nrelaxation of the authority of the Government in the protection of\r\nelections from violence and corruption, I believe it demands greater\r\nvigor both in the enactment and in the execution of the laws framed\r\nfor that purpose. Any oppression, any partisan partiality, which\r\nexperience may have shown in the working of existing laws may well\r\nengage the careful attention both of Congress and of the Executive,\r\nin their respective spheres of duty, for the correction of these\r\nmischiefs. As no Congressional elections occur until after the regular\r\nsession of Congress will have been held, there seems to be no public\r\nexigency that would preclude a seasonable consideration at that\r\nsession of any administrative details that might improve the present\r\nmethods designed for the protection of all citizens in the complete\r\nand equal exercise of the right and power of the suffrage at such\r\nelections. But with my views, both of the constitutionality and of the\r\nvalue of the existing laws, I can not approve any measure for their\r\nrepeal except in connection with the enactment of other legislation\r\nwhich may reasonably be expected to afford wiser and more efficient\r\nsafeguards for free and honest Congressional elections.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 23, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter careful examination of the bill entitled \"An act making\r\nappropriations for certain judicial expenses,\" I return it herewith\r\nto the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with the\r\nfollowing objections to its approval:\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of the bill is to provide for certain judicial\r\nexpenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880,\r\nfor which the sum of $2,690,000 is appropriated. These appropriations\r\nare required to keep in operation the general functions of the\r\njudicial department of the Government, and if this part of the bill\r\nstood alone there would be no objection to its approval. It contains,\r\nhowever, other provisions, to which I desire respectfully to ask your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt the present session of Congress a majority of both Houses, favoring\r\na repeal of the Congressional election laws embraced in title 26 of\r\nthe Revised Statutes, passed a measure for that purpose, as part of\r\na bill entitled \"An act making appropriations for the legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1880, and for other purposes.\" Unable to concur with\r\nCongress in that measure, on the 29th of May last I returned the bill\r\nto the House of Representatives, in which it originated, without my\r\napproval, for that further consideration for which the Constitution\r\nprovides. On reconsideration the bill was approved by less than\r\ntwo-thirds of the House, and failed to become a law. The election laws\r\ntherefore remain valid enactments, and the supreme law of the land,\r\nbinding not only upon all private citizens, but also alike and equally\r\nbinding upon all who are charged with the duties and responsibilities\r\nof the legislative, the executive, and the judicial departments of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is not sought by the bill before me to repeal the election laws.\r\nIts object is to defeat their enforcement. The last clause of the\r\nfirst section is as follows:\r\n\r\n  And no part of the money hereby appropriated is appropriated\r\n  to pay any salaries, compensation, fees, or expenses under\r\n  or in virtue of title 26 of the Revised Statutes, or of any\r\n  provision of said title.\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle 26 of the Revised Statutes, referred to in the foregoing clause,\r\nrelates to the elective franchise, and contains the laws now in force\r\nregulating the Congressional elections.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the bill reaches much further. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. That the sums appropriated in this act for the persons\r\n  and public service embraced in its provisions are in full for\r\n  such persons and public service for the fiscal year ending\r\n  June 30, 1880; and no Department or officer of the Government\r\n  shall during said fiscal year make any contract or incur any\r\n  liability for the future payment of money under any of the\r\n  provisions of title 26 of the Revised Statutes of the United\r\n  States authorizing the appointment or payment of general\r\n  or special deputy marshals for service in connection with\r\n  elections or on election day until an appropriation sufficient\r\n  to meet such contract or pay such liability shall have first\r\n  been made by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section of the bill is intended to make an extensive and\r\nessential change in the existing laws. The following are the\r\nprovisions of the statutes on the same subject which are now in force:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3679. No Department of the Government shall expend in any\r\n  one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriations made by\r\n  Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in\r\n  any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such\r\n  appropriations.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3732. No contract or purchase on behalf of the United\r\n  States shall be made unless the same is authorized by law or\r\n  is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment, except\r\n  in the War and Navy Departments, for clothing, subsistence,\r\n  forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation, which, however,\r\n  shall not exceed the necessities of the current year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of these sections of the Revised Statutes is plain. It is,\r\nfirst, to prevent any money from being expended unless appropriations\r\nhave been made therefor, and, second, to prevent the Government from\r\nbeing bound by any contract not previously authorized by law, except\r\nfor certain necessary purposes in the War and Navy Departments.\r\n\r\nUnder the existing laws the failure of Congress to make the\r\nappropriations required for the execution of the provisions of the\r\nelection laws would not prevent their enforcement. The right and duty\r\nto appoint the general and special deputy marshals which they provide\r\nfor would still remain, and the executive department of the Government\r\nwould also be empowered to incur the requisite liability for\r\ntheir compensation. But the second section of this bill contains a\r\nprohibition not found in any previous legislation. Its design is to\r\nrender the election laws inoperative and a dead letter during the\r\nnext fiscal year. It is sought to accomplish this by omitting to\r\nappropriate money for their enforcement and by expressly prohibiting\r\nany Department or officer of the Government from incurring any\r\nliability under any of the provisions of title 26 of the Revised\r\nStatutes authorizing the appointment or payment of general or special\r\ndeputy marshals for service on election days until an appropriation\r\nsufficient to pay such liability shall have first been made.\r\n\r\nThe President is called upon to give his affirmative approval to\r\npositive enactments which in effect deprive him of the ordinary and\r\nnecessary means of executing laws still left in the statute book\r\nand embraced within his constitutional duty to see that the laws are\r\nexecuted. If he approves the bill, and thus gives to such positive\r\nenactments the authority of law, he participates in the curtailment\r\nof his means of seeing that the law is faithfully executed, while\r\nthe obligation of the law and of his constitutional duty remains\r\nunimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of special deputy marshals is not made by the statute\r\na spontaneous act of authority on the part of any executive or\r\njudicial officer of the Government, but is accorded as a popular right\r\nof the citizens to call into operation this agency for securing the\r\npurity and freedom of elections in any city or town having 20,000\r\ninhabitants or upward. Section 2021 of the Revised Statutes puts it in\r\nthe power of any two citizens of such city or town to require of\r\nthe marshal of the district the appointment of these special deputy\r\nmarshals. Thereupon the duty of the marshal becomes imperative, and\r\nits nonperformance would expose him to judicial mandate or punishment\r\nor to removal from office by the President, as the circumstances of\r\nhis conduct might require. The bill now before me neither revokes this\r\npopular right of the citizens, nor relieves the marshal of the duty\r\nimposed by law, nor the President of his duty to see that this law is\r\nfaithfully executed.\r\n\r\nI forbear to enter again upon any general discussion of the wisdom\r\nand necessity of the election laws or of the dangerous and\r\nunconstitutional principle of this bill--that the power vested in\r\nCongress to originate appropriations involves the right to compel the\r\nExecutive to approve any legislation which Congress may see fit to\r\nattach to such bills, under the penalty of refusing the means needed\r\nto carry on essential functions of the Government. My views on these\r\nsubjects have been sufficiently presented in the special messages sent\r\nby me to the House of Representatives during their present session.\r\nWhat was said in those messages I regard as conclusive as to my\r\nduty in respect to the bill before me. The arguments urged in those\r\ncommunications against the repeal of the election laws and against\r\nthe right of Congress to deprive the Executive of that separate and\r\nindependent discretion and judgment which the Constitution confers and\r\nrequires are equally cogent in opposition to this bill. This\r\nmeasure leaves the powers and duties of the supervisors of elections\r\nuntouched. The compensation of those officers is provided for under\r\npermanent laws, and no liability for which an appropriation is now\r\nrequired would therefore be incurred by their appointment. But the\r\npower of the National Government to protect them in the discharge of\r\ntheir duty at the polls would be taken away. The States may employ\r\nboth civil and military power at the elections, but by this bill even\r\nthe civil authority to protect Congressional elections is denied to\r\nthe United States. The object is to prevent any adequate control\r\nby the United States over the national elections by forbidding\r\nthe payment of deputy marshals, the officers who are clothed with\r\nauthority to enforce the election laws.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these laws are deemed objectionable by a majority of\r\nboth Houses of Congress is urged as a sufficient warrant for this\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThere are two lawful ways to overturn legislative enactments. One\r\nis their repeal; the other is the decision of a competent tribunal\r\nagainst their validity. The effect of this bill is to deprive the\r\nexecutive department of the Government of the means to execute laws\r\nwhich are not repealed, which have not been declared invalid, and\r\nwhich it is therefore the duty of the executive and of every other\r\ndepartment of Government to obey and to enforce.\r\n\r\nI have in my former message on this subject expressed a willingness\r\nto concur in suitable amendments for the improvement of the election\r\nlaws; but I can not consent to their absolute and entire repeal, and I\r\ncan not approve legislation which seeks to prevent their enforcement.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 27, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval Senate bill No. 595,[28] with the following\r\nobjection to its becoming a law:\r\n\r\nDoubts have arisen upon consideration of the bill as to whether Major\r\nCollins will be required under it to refund to the United States the\r\npay and allowances received by him at the time he was mustered out of\r\nthe service. Believing that it was not the intention of Congress to\r\nrequire such repayment, the bill is returned without my signature to\r\nthe House in which it originated.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: \"An act to amend 'An act for the relief of Joseph B.\r\nCollins, approved March 3, 1879.'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 30, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,\r\nthe bill entitled \"An act making appropriations to pay fees of United\r\nStates marshals and their general deputies,\" with the following\r\nobjections to its becoming a law:\r\n\r\nThe bill appropriates the sum of $600,000 for the payment during the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1880, of United States marshals and their\r\ngeneral deputies. The offices thus provided for are essential to the\r\nfaithful execution of the laws. They were created and their powers and\r\nduties defined by Congress at its first session after the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution in the judiciary act which was approved September\r\n24, 1789. Their general duties, as defined in the act which originally\r\nestablished them, were substantially the same as those prescribed in\r\nthe statutes now in force.\r\n\r\nThe principal provision on the subject in the Revised Statutes is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 787. It shall be the duty of the marshal of each district\r\n  to attend the district and circuit courts when sitting\r\n  therein, and to execute throughout the district all lawful\r\n  precepts directed to him and issued under the authority of\r\n  the United States; and he shall have power to command all\r\n  necessary assistance in the execution of his duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original act was amended February 28, 1795, and the amendment is\r\nnow found in the Revised Statutes in the following form:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 788. The marshals and their deputies shall have in each\r\n  State the same powers in executing the laws of the United\r\n  States as the sheriffs and their deputies in such State may\r\n  have by law in executing the laws thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy subsequent statutes additional duties have been from time to time\r\nimposed upon the marshals and their deputies, the due and regular\r\nperformance of which are required for the efficiency of almost every\r\nbranch of the public service. Without these officers there would be\r\nno means of executing the warrants, decrees, or other process of\r\nthe courts, and the judicial system of the country would be fatally\r\ndefective. The criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the United\r\nStates is very extensive. The crimes committed within the maritime\r\njurisdiction of the United States are all cognizable only in the\r\ncourts of the United States. Crimes against public justice; crimes\r\nagainst the operations of the Government, such as forging or\r\ncounterfeiting the money or securities of the United States; crimes\r\nagainst the postal laws; offenses against the elective franchise,\r\nagainst the civil rights of citizens, against the existence of the\r\nGovernment; crimes against the internal-revenue laws, the customs\r\nlaws, the neutrality laws; crimes against laws for the protection of\r\nIndians and of the public lands--all of these crimes and many others\r\ncan be punished only under United States laws, laws which, taken\r\ntogether, constitute a body of jurisprudence which is vital to the\r\nwelfare of the whole country, and which can be enforced only by means\r\nof the marshals and deputy marshals of the United States. In the\r\nDistrict of Columbia all of the process of the courts is executed by\r\nthe officers in question. In short, the execution of the criminal laws\r\nof the United States, the service of all civil process in cases in\r\nwhich the United States is a party, and the execution of the revenue\r\nlaws, the neutrality laws, and many other laws of large importance\r\ndepend on the maintenance of the marshals and their deputies. They are\r\nin effect the only police of the United States Government. Officers\r\nwith corresponding powers and duties are found in every State of the\r\nUnion and in every country which has a jurisprudence which is worthy\r\nof the name. To deprive the National Government of these officers\r\nwould be as disastrous to society as to abolish the sheriffs,\r\nconstables, and police officers in the several States. It would be a\r\ndenial to the United States of the right to execute its laws--a\r\ndenial of all authority which requires the use of civil force. The law\r\nentitles these officers to be paid. The funds needed for the purpose\r\nhave been collected from the people and are now in the Treasury. No\r\nobjection is, therefore, made to that part of the bill before me which\r\nappropriates money for the support of the marshals and deputy marshals\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe bill contains, however, other provisions which are identical in\r\ntenor and effect with the second section of the bill entitled \"An act\r\nmaking appropriations for certain judicial expenses,\" which on the 23d\r\nof the present month was returned to the House of Representatives\r\nwith my objections to its approval. The provisions referred to are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. That the sums appropriated in this act for the persons\r\n  and public service embraced in its provisions are in full for\r\n  such persons and public service for the fiscal year ending\r\n  June 30, 1880; and no Department or officer of the Government\r\n  shall during said fiscal year make any contract or incur any\r\n  liability for the future payment of money under any of the\r\n  provisions of title 26 mentioned in section 1 of this act\r\n  until an appropriation sufficient to meet such contract or pay\r\n  such liability shall have first been made by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon a reconsideration in the House of Representatives of the bill\r\nwhich contained these provisions it lacked a constitutional majority,\r\nand therefore failed to become a law. In order to secure its\r\nenactment, the same measure is again presented for my approval,\r\ncoupled in the bill before me with appropriations for the support of\r\nmarshals and their deputies during the next fiscal year. The object,\r\nmanifestly, is to place before the Executive this alternative: Either\r\nto allow necessary functions of the public service to be crippled\r\nor suspended for want of the appropriations required to keep them in\r\noperation, or to approve legislation which in official communications\r\nto Congress he has declared would be a violation of his constitutional\r\nduty. Thus in this bill the principle is clearly embodied that by\r\nvirtue of the provision of the Constitution which requires that\r\n\"all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives\" a bare majority of the House of Representatives has\r\nthe right to withhold appropriations for the support of the Government\r\nunless the Executive consents to approve any legislation which may\r\nbe attached to appropriation bills. I respectfully refer to the\r\ncommunications on this subject which I have sent to Congress during\r\nits present session for a statement of the grounds of my conclusions,\r\nand desire here merely to repeat that in my judgment to establish\r\nthe principle of this bill is to make a radical, dangerous, and\r\nunconstitutional change in the character of our institutions.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B.

Hayes, President of the United States, do\r\nadmonish and warn all such persons so intending or preparing to remove\r\nupon said lands or into said Territory without permission of the\r\nproper agent of the Indian Department against any attempt to so remove\r\nor settle upon any of the lands of said Territory; and I do further\r\nwarn and notify any and all such persons who may so offend that they\r\nwill be speedily and immediately removed therefrom by the agent,\r\naccording to the laws made and provided; and if necessary the aid and\r\nassistance of the military forces of the United States will be invoked\r\nto carry into proper execution the laws of the United States herein\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 26th day of April, A.D. 1879, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and third.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B.

MERRITT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL: I congratulate you on your confirmation. It is a\r\ngreat gratification to me, very honorable to you, and will prove,\r\nI believe, of signal service to the country. My desire is that the\r\noffice be conducted on strictly business principles, and according to\r\nthe rules for the civil service which were recommended by the Civil\r\nService Commission in the Administration of General Grant. I want\r\nyou to be perfectly independent of mere influence from any quarter.\r\nNeither my recommendation, nor that of Secretary Sherman, nor of\r\nany member of Congress or other influential person must be specially\r\nregarded. Let appointments and removals be made on business principles\r\nand according to rules. There must be, I assume, a few places filled\r\nby those you personally know to be trustworthy, but restrict the area\r\nof patronage to the narrowest limits. Let no man be put out merely\r\nbecause he is a friend to Mr. Arthur, and no man put in merely because\r\nhe is our friend. The good of the service should be the sole end in\r\nview. The best means yet presented, it seems to me, are the rules\r\nrecommended by the Civil Service Commission. I shall issue no new\r\norder on the subject at present. I am glad you approve of the message,\r\nand I wish you to see that all that is expressed or implied in it is\r\nfaithfully carried out.\r\n\r\nAgain congratulating you, and assuring you of my entire confidence,\r\nI remain, sincerely,\r\n\r\nR.B.

Because,\r\ntherefore, of the danger which attaches to rags, furs, etc., as\r\ncarriers of infection, the following regulations are framed, under\r\nthe direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and subject to the\r\napproval of the President, for the protection of the health of the\r\npeople of the United States against the danger referred to:\r\n\r\nUntil further orders no vessel from any port of the Black Sea or the\r\nSea of Azof, conveying any rags, furs, skins, hair, feathers, boxed\r\nor baled clothing or bedding, or any similar articles liable to convey\r\ninfection, nor any vessel from any port of the Mediterranean or Red\r\nseas having on board such articles coming from southern Russia, shall\r\nenter any port of the United States until such articles shall have\r\nbeen removed from the vessel to open lighters or to some isolated\r\nlocality and the vessel disinfected and thoroughly ventilated; and the\r\nsuspected articles shall be disinfected, either by chemical agents and\r\nexposure to free currents of air or by burning, as shall be determined\r\nin each case by the Surgeon-General of the Marine-Hospital Service.\r\n\r\nThe certificate of the State or municipal quarantine officer of health\r\nmay be accepted as satisfactory evidence of compliance with these\r\nregulations on the part of the vessel.\r\n\r\nJNO. M. WOODWORTH,\r\n  _Surgeon-General United States Marine-Hospital Service._\r\n\r\nApproved:\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTOM-HOUSE, NEW YORK CITY,\r\n  _Collector's Office, February 26, 1879._\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN SHERMAN,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury._\r\n\r\nSIR: The President, by letter of 4th instant, having requested\r\nthat appointments and promotions in this office should be made in\r\naccordance with the civil-service rules of 1872, and having also made\r\na similar request of the naval officer, it has been deemed best to\r\nmake, if practicable, the same rules applicable to all the offices\r\nin this city included in the order of the Treasury Department dated\r\nAugust 7, 1872.\r\n\r\nWith that view, and after several conferences, it has been agreed\r\nby the assistant treasurer, naval officer, appraiser, surveyor, and\r\nmyself to submit the inclosed modifications of the rules of 1872, and\r\nshould they meet approval to put in operation forthwith the rules so\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nE.A. MERRITT, _Collector._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The modifications submitted with the above letter are omitted,\r\nand instead are inserted the following regulations, based upon said\r\nmodifications, approved by the President March 6, 1879, and amended\r\nwith his approval in January, 1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulations Governing Appointments and Promotions in the Customs\r\nService and Subtreasury in the City of New York.\r\n\r\nI. Every application for appointment to a vacancy in the lowest grade\r\nof any group in the offices of the collector and the surveyor of\r\ncustoms, the naval officer, the appraiser, and the assistant treasurer\r\nof the United States in the city of New York must be made in the\r\nhandwriting of the applicant to the head of the office in which\r\nemployment is desired. It must state: (1) The position to which the\r\napplicant desires to be appointed;[29] (2) place and date of birth;\r\n(3) legal residence, and how long it has been such; (4) education; (5)\r\noccupation, past and present; (6) whether ever employed in the civil\r\nservice, and, if so, when, how long, in what branch and capacity, and\r\nreasons for leaving the service; (7) whether ever in the Regular or\r\nVolunteer Army or Navy, and, if so, when and in what organization and\r\ncapacity; (8) applicant's name in full.\r\n\r\nII. The applicant must certify to having composed and written the\r\napplication without assistance; to the truth of the statements which\r\nit contains; to being a citizen of the United States, and faithful\r\nto the Union and the Constitution; and, if ever in the Regular or\r\nVolunteer Army or Navy, to having been honorably discharged.\r\n\r\nIII. Every application must be accompanied by a certificate, signed by\r\ntwo trustworthy and responsible persons, well known in the community\r\nin which they reside, that the applicant is personally well known to\r\nthem to be of good moral character and of temperate and industrious\r\nhabits, and to be faithful to the Union and the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIV. Every application must also be accompanied by the certificate of a\r\npracticing physician as to the applicant's general health and physical\r\ncapacity to perform the duties of the position to which he desires to\r\nbe appointed: _Provided, however_, That no appointment will be made to\r\nany position in active outdoor service unless a surgeon of the United\r\nStates Marine-Hospital Service shall certify that he has made a\r\nphysical examination of the applicant and found him fit for such\r\nposition. Such surgeon's examination may be postponed until required\r\nby the nominating officer.\r\n\r\nV. Applications filed previously to the adoption of these regulations\r\nmust be renewed or perfected in accordance therewith to entitle them\r\nto consideration. No applications for appointment as day or night\r\ninspectors in the custom-house from persons under 21 years of age,\r\nor for other positions under these regulations from persons under 18\r\nyears of age, will be considered. In compliance with section 1031 of\r\nthe Treasury Regulations now in force, persons over 45 years of age\r\nare not eligible to any group the lowest grade of which is confined\r\nto persons receiving an annual salary of less than $1,800. This\r\nprohibition, however, shall not be applied to those who have been\r\nhonorably discharged from the service and are otherwise qualified.\r\n\r\nVI. All applications upon their receipt will be carefully examined\r\nby the board of examiners, and those which do not conform in every\r\nparticular to the foregoing requirements, and such as show that the\r\napplicants are manifestly not qualified for the duties of the position\r\ndesired, will be rejected and the applicants so notified. All other\r\napplicants will be designated as eligible for examination, and will\r\nbe so notified. Inasmuch as applications are to be made in writing and\r\neach case is to be decided upon its merits, personal importunity will\r\nhave no weight.\r\n\r\nVII. Not less than five days prior to each examination a notification\r\nto appear at a time and place to be stated will be mailed to the\r\neligible candidates, unless it shall be found impracticable to examine\r\nall of them, in which case a practicable number will be selected under\r\nthe second regulation[30] for the civil service promulgated April 16,\r\n1872, and notified to appear for examination. Those not selected for\r\nexamination will remain on the eligible list. If any person notified\r\nto appear shall be unable to do so on account of sickness or other\r\ncauses, he must promptly advise the board of examiners, in person or\r\nby mail, of his inability to attend, and his name will remain upon\r\nthe eligible list; but any person attending an examination will not be\r\nallowed to subsequently plead sickness or other disabling causes as an\r\nexcuse for defects in examination.\r\n\r\nVIII. All candidates for appointment to positions the annual salary\r\nof which is $1,200 or more, who shall appear in accordance with such\r\nnotification, will be subjected to a competitive written examination\r\nupon the following subjects:\r\n\r\n(1) Copying from dictation; (2) arithmetic--fundamental rules,\r\nfractions, proportion, percentage and interest, reduction; (3)\r\nelements of accounts and bookkeeping; (4) geography, history, and\r\ngovernment--general questions, principally such as relate to the\r\nUnited States; (5) elements of English grammar, chiefly orthography\r\nand syntax; (6) writing and briefing letters; and (7) penmanship.\r\n\r\nCandidates for appointment to positions the salary of which is\r\nless than $1,200 will be examined in like manner upon the following\r\nsubjects: (1) Penmanship, (2) copying; (3) elements of English\r\ngrammar, chiefly orthography and syntax; and (4) fundamental rules of\r\narithmetic.\r\n\r\nProficiency in penmanship, orthography, and punctuation will be\r\ndetermined principally by a review of the examination papers, and as\r\nfar as possible the examination in all the branches will be confined\r\nto practical exercises.\r\n\r\nIn examinations for appointments to positions requiring special\r\nor technical knowledge such additions may be made by the board of\r\nexaminers to the list of subjects as the nature of the case may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nFor temporary employment to meet casual exigencies in the public\r\nbusiness, or for special services as experts, appointments may be made\r\nwithout examination; but no such appointment shall be made for a term\r\nexceeding three months, which may be specially extended for a similar\r\nterm only; and no such appointment shall be made to any regular or\r\npermanent position.\r\n\r\nIX. The various subjects of the examination may be subdivided, if\r\nthought desirable, into classes, and to each subject or class a\r\nrelative weight, according to its importance in the examination, will\r\nbe assigned by each board of examiners. The mode of ascertaining the\r\nresult of the examination will be as follows: The degree of accuracy\r\nwith which each question shall be answered will first be marked by the\r\nboard on a scale of 100. The average of the marks given to the answers\r\nto the questions in each subject or class will next be ascertained.\r\nEach average will then be multiplied by the number indicating the\r\nrelative weight of the subject or class, and the sum of the products\r\nwill be divided by the sum of the relative weights. The quotient will\r\ndetermine the candidate's standing in the examination. Relative weight\r\nwill be assigned not merely to the special qualifications of the\r\ncandidates, but to their general aptitude, as shown in the course of\r\nexamination. Candidates will be examined during office hours, and in\r\nno case will their examination be continued more than one day.\r\n\r\nX. The board of examiners will prepare a list of the persons examined\r\nin the order of their excellence, as proved by such examination,\r\nbeginning with the highest, and will then certify to the head of the\r\noffice the names standing at the head of such list, not exceeding\r\nthree. When more than one appointment is to be made, the vacancies\r\nwill be numbered, and the first three names will be certified for\r\nthe first vacancy, the remaining two and the fourth for the second\r\nvacancy, the remaining two and the fifth for the third vacancy, and so\r\non for the whole number of vacancies; but if, after selecting one\r\nof any three certified for appointment, the head of the office shall\r\nobject to another presentation of either of the remaining names, it\r\nshall not be again certified.\r\n\r\nXI. The examination papers of any candidate who shall have passed a\r\nminimum standard of 75 per cent, but who shall fail to be appointed,\r\nwill, if requested by the candidate, be brought into competition with\r\nthose candidates who shall compete for vacancies of the same class\r\nand nature occurring within one year: _Provided, however_, That the\r\ncandidate shall not have been specially objected to by the head of\r\nthe office under the last preceding regulation. No candidate who upon\r\nexamination has been marked below the minimum will be allowed to again\r\ncompete within one year from the date of such examination, unless for\r\nadmission to a lower group.\r\n\r\nXII. All examination papers will be filed, and will at all times be\r\nopen to the inspection of those interested, under such restrictions as\r\nmay be imposed by the head of the office.\r\n\r\nXIII. There shall be one examining board for all appointments\r\nand promotions under these rules in the offices of the collector,\r\nsurveyor, and naval officer, which shall consist of the surveyor and\r\none representative to be nominated each by the collector and the\r\nnaval officer, and three alternates, to be nominated one each by the\r\ncollector, the naval officer, and the surveyor: _Provided, however_,\r\nThat in examinations for positions in the surveyor's office the\r\nsurveyor's alternate shall act on such board. The examining boards in\r\nthe offices of the assistant treasurer and the appraiser shall consist\r\nof three persons, with three alternates, to be nominated by the\r\nassistant treasurer and the appraiser, respectively. All nominations\r\nas members and alternates on the examining boards shall be submitted\r\nto the Secretary of the Treasury for his approval. The heads of the\r\nseveral offices shall constitute a board of revision and appeal,\r\nwhich, upon appeal from any person examined or from any member of an\r\nexamining board, shall revise the decision of said board.\r\n\r\nXIV. Whenever the head of an office shall notify the board of\r\nexaminers for such office that a vacancy which he desires to fill\r\nexists in any grade above the lowest not excepted from the rules\r\nand regulations for the civil service, the board will fix a time for\r\nholding an examination for the purpose, and at least five days before\r\nthe same is to take place will cause a notice to be posted in a\r\nconspicuous place in the office, stating the grade and group of the\r\nvacancy, the date of the examination, and that the vacancy is to be\r\nfilled by a competitive examination of applicants from the next lower\r\ngrade, unless none in such lower grade be found qualified, when those\r\nin the next lower grade may compete, or, if there be none in any of\r\nthe lower grades qualified, competition will be open to applicants. In\r\nany examination for promotion, if the competitors from the next\r\nlower grade shall not exceed three in number, the board may, at its\r\ndiscretion, open the competition to the next lower grade or below, as\r\nthey may deem best; and furthermore, if such promotion would probably\r\noccasion vacancies requiring other promotions, the board may combine\r\nin one the necessary examinations for such promotions. No person who\r\nhas been examined in any grade for promotion and failed to receive\r\nsuch promotion shall again be admitted to examination within six\r\nmonths, but in the meantime his general average, as ascertained by\r\nsuch examination, may be brought into competition, as provided in\r\nRegulation XI.\r\n\r\nXV. The examination will be held upon the general subjects fixed for\r\nexaminations for admission to the lowest grade of the group and upon\r\nsuch other subjects as the general nature of the business of the\r\noffice and the special nature of the position to be filled may seem\r\nto the board of examiners to require. Due weight will be given to the\r\nefficiency with which the several candidates shall have previously\r\nperformed their duties in the office; but no one who shall fail to\r\npass a minimum standard of 75 per cent in the written examination will\r\nbe certified for appointment.\r\n\r\nXVI. If no applicants from within the group shall be found competent,\r\nan examination will be held of all who shall make application in\r\naccordance with the regulations governing applications for admission\r\nto the office, after due public notice by the head of the office. The\r\nexamination will be conducted in accordance with the provisions for\r\nadmission to the office, as required by the fourth rule[31] for the\r\ncivil service promulgated December 19, 1871, but the nature of the\r\nexamination will be the same as in any previous examination for the\r\nsame vacancy.\r\n\r\nXVII. The list of names from which the appointment is to be made will\r\nbe prepared and certified in the manner provided for admission to the\r\nlowest grade.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Persons employed in any of the offices to which these rules are\r\napplicable may be transferred without examination from one office to\r\na grade no higher in another office, with, the consent of the heads\r\nof the respective offices and the approval of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nXIX. Under the provisions of rule 2[32] of August 5, 1873, and the\r\noperation of these regulations, the power of suspension and of\r\nrecommendation for discharge from the service shall remain with the\r\nnominating officer unrestricted.

MERRITT,\r\n  _Collector of Customs, New York_\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 26th ultimo, inclosing a draft of modification\r\nof the civil-service rules, was duly received, and the rules have been\r\nconsidered and approved by the President. You may therefore act upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nJOHN SHERMAN,\r\n  _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES GOVERNING APPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION IN THE NEW YORK POST-OFFICE.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of making it more certain that only persons of\r\ngood character and adequate capacity shall be selected from among\r\napplicants too numerous for the postmaster to become informed of their\r\nindividual merits by personal investigation, the following rules are\r\nestablished:\r\n\r\n1. Hereafter all applications for clerical appointment at this\r\npost-office must be made in accordance with a prescribed form, a copy\r\nof which will be furnished to each applicant.\r\n\r\n2. All appointments to clerical positions will be made to the lowest\r\ngrade, and no applications from persons under 16 or over 25 years of\r\nage will be entertained.\r\n\r\n3. On receipt of an application for appointment, and before further\r\naction is taken in regard to it, the applicant will be referred to the\r\nmedical officer for examination as to his physical condition, as\r\nbeing adequate for the service; and if the report is unfavorable the\r\napplication will be rejected. Should the report be favorable, the\r\napplication will be filed and registered in its regular order.\r\n\r\n4. Every application must be accompanied by a certificate, signed by\r\nnot less than three nor more than five reputable citizens, stating\r\nthe time for which each has been acquainted with the applicant,\r\nand testifying to his good character and reputation for integrity,\r\nsobriety, and industry, and to the willingness of the signers to\r\nfurnish personally any further information they may possess concerning\r\nthe applicant, if so requested by the postmaster or the board of\r\nexaminers.\r\n\r\n5. Applications not properly filled out as herein required, or which\r\nare found to contain false statements, or which in any other manner\r\nshow the unfitness of the applicant for employment in the post-office,\r\nwill be rejected and the applicant notified of such rejection.\r\n\r\n6. All examination papers, with the markings showing the relative\r\nproficiency of the candidates, will be carefully preserved and filed.\r\n\r\n7. The names of candidates which have been on the register for\r\none year without being reached for examination will be regarded as\r\nremoved, and will not be selected for examination unless again\r\nplaced on the register by a new application, after which they will be\r\nselected when reached in order.\r\n\r\n8. All applications duly received and filed shall, when reached in\r\norder, be referred to a board of examiners, which is hereby appointed,\r\nand which shall consist of the assistant postmaster, auditor, the\r\ngeneral superintendents of the fourth, fifth, and sixth divisions,\r\nand the assistant general superintendent of the third division. The\r\npostmaster's private secretary shall also act as secretary of said\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n9. When vacancies occur in the lowest grade, the board of examiners\r\nshall notify such number of applicants, not less than twenty, of\r\nthose first on the register of applicants to appear for a competitive\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n10. The questions to be asked and answered at such examinations shall\r\nbe such as will show the relative proficiency of the candidates,\r\nfirst, in penmanship; second, in arithmetic; third, in geography;\r\nfourth, in English grammar; fifth, in the history of the United States\r\nand in matters of a public nature, to the extent that may be required\r\nadequately to test general capacity or special fitness for the postal\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n11. The board shall present to the postmaster a list of the names of\r\nthe successful candidates in the order of their excellence, as shown\r\nby the examination, beginning with the highest; and the appointments\r\nwill be made from the three highest names on the list.\r\n\r\n12. All further details in methods of examination will be left to\r\nthe discretion of the board, but subject to the instructions of the\r\npostmaster, in conformity herewith.\r\n\r\n13. All vacancies that may occur in the higher grades of any\r\ndepartment shall be filled by promotion from the lower grades by means\r\nof competitive examinations, to which shall be admitted as competitors\r\nsuch persons only as are already employed in the division in which the\r\nvacancy exists or in divisions having analogous duties. The questions\r\nin these examinations shall be restricted mainly to matters pertaining\r\nto the ordinary business of that department. The examinations shall be\r\nconducted by the general superintendent of the division to which the\r\ndepartment is attached, assisted by such one or more other officers\r\nof the same as the postmaster may select; and they shall report the\r\nresult to the postmaster in the manner provided in rule 11, and the\r\nvacancy will be filled by the promotion of some one of the three\r\nstanding highest in the competition. But whenever the vacancy to be\r\nfilled by promotion is that of a position requiring the exercise of\r\nadministrative authority the board may add such questions as will test\r\nthe degree to which the candidates possess special qualifications for\r\nsuch position.\r\n\r\n14. For positions as porters the examination will be confined to\r\nquestions intended to test the physical ability of the candidates and\r\ntheir proficiency in reading, penmanship, and elementary arithmetic\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n15. The postmaster reserves from the operation of the above rules for\r\noriginal Appointment and promotion positions of especial pecuniary\r\ntrust, as well as those involving confidential relations, as private\r\nsecretary, etc.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS L. JAMES, _Postmaster_.\r\n\r\nApproved. Let these rules go into effect May 1, 1879.\r\n\r\nD.M. KEY, _Postmaster-General._\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 3, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing rules are approved.\r\n\r\nR.B.

I congratulate Congress on the\r\nsuccessful execution of the resumption act. At the time fixed, and\r\nin the manner contemplated by law, United States notes began to\r\nbe redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of January last they have been\r\npromptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions,\r\npublic and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and\r\npaid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the Treasury\r\nfor gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been\r\ncomparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion\r\nin exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious\r\nmetals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount\r\nof United States notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great\r\nrevival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the\r\nmoney of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal\r\ncompetition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing\r\nforeign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has\r\ncaused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in\r\ngold, from the 1st of July last to November 15, to the amount of about\r\n$59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also\r\nbeen a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The\r\nbonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent interest have been\r\nsold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all of the\r\nnational debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of\r\ninterest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since\r\nMarch 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small\r\nsums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities\r\nis much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt\r\nwhich matures within less than two years is $792,121,700, of which\r\n$500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, and the balance\r\nis in bonds bearing 6 per cent interest. It is believed that this part\r\nof the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent bonds,\r\nand, by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about\r\n$11,000,000 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this\r\nimportant reduction of interest to be paid by the United States\r\nfurther legislation is required, which it is hoped will be provided by\r\nCongress during its present session.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the last\r\nfiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since\r\nthe passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was\r\n$45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury\r\nand are now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the\r\npossession of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United\r\nStates and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a\r\npermanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized\r\nmoney of the world leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from\r\nnew legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade,\r\ninternal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own\r\ninstructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further\r\nexperimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly\r\nurge upon Congress the importance of authorizing the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present\r\nlegal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and\r\nlargely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously\r\nimpracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are\r\ncoined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation,\r\nit will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of\r\nvalue, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both\r\ngold and silver which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar,\r\nwith the universally recognized money of the world.\r\n\r\nThe retirement from circulation of United States notes with the\r\ncapacity of legal tender in private contracts is a step to be taken\r\nin our progress toward a safe and stable currency which should be\r\naccepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest\r\nand security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of\r\nlegal-tender paper money based wholly upon the authority and credit of\r\nthe Government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the\r\nConstitution and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue\r\nof United States notes during the late civil war with the capacity of\r\nlegal tender between private individuals was not authorized except as\r\na means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation\r\nof these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after\r\nthe accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the\r\nframers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the\r\nredemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable\r\nperiod consistent with the attainment of the object for which they\r\nwere provided.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national\r\ndebt; and when, from necessity in time of war, debts have been\r\ncreated, they have been paid off, on the return of peace, as rapidly\r\nas possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended\r\nthat the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund\r\nsufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period\r\nbe maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is\r\ndeemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has\r\nshown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not\r\nenhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will\r\nadd several millions of dollars annually to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent\r\nand influential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the\r\nUnited States for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demands\r\nthe attention of every department of the Government. This Territory\r\nhas a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State,\r\nand the general interests of the nation, as well as the welfare of the\r\ncitizens of the Territory, require its advance from the Territorial\r\nform of government to the responsibilities and privileges of a State.\r\nThis important change will not, however, be approved by the country\r\nwhile the citizens of Utah in very considerable number uphold a\r\npractice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized\r\ncommunities throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great\r\nunanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained\r\nuntil recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the\r\npeculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely\r\nprevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention\r\nof the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom. This objection\r\nis now removed. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the\r\nlaw to be within the legislative power of Congress and binding as a\r\nrule of action for all who reside within the Territories. There is\r\nno longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement.\r\nIt should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently\r\nstringent in its provisions, it should be amended; and in aid of the\r\npurpose in view I recommend that more comprehensive and more searching\r\nmethods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If\r\nnecessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise\r\nof the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the\r\nUnited States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or\r\noppose the enforcement of the law on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe elections of the past year, though occupied only with State\r\nofficers, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which\r\nattended them all over the country new and decisive evidence of the\r\ndeep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress\r\nof the country toward a more general and complete establishment, at\r\nwhatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of\r\nthe elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand\r\ngreat attention from our people, both in the sphere of national and\r\nState authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed\r\nin my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative\r\ninterests of government, however urgent or weighty, will ever\r\ndisplace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of\r\ncitizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all\r\npolitical prejudices, and all sectional and State attachments in\r\ndemanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of\r\ncitizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and\r\ncarry with them unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal\r\nto the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part\r\nof the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other\r\npolitical subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws\r\naimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge\r\nupon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has\r\nshown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the\r\ncooperation of the executive and legislative authorities of the States\r\nin this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind\r\ncan be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights no\r\nserious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the\r\ncountry or retard the general diffusion of prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject of the reformation of the civil service of the Government,\r\nand expressed the intention of transmitting to Congress as early as\r\npracticable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the Civil\r\nService Commission.\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts that during a considerable period the Government\r\nof Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and\r\nabuses in various particulars analogous to those presented in this\r\ncountry, and that in recent years the measures adopted were understood\r\nto have been effective and in every respect highly satisfactory, I\r\nthought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and\r\naccordingly requested the chairman of the Civil Service Commission to\r\nmake a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an\r\nelaborate and comprehensive report.\r\n\r\nThe report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system\r\nin Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary\r\npatronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elections.\r\nIt shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations those\r\nwhich are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are\r\ncarried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have,\r\nwith great advantage, been established as conditions of admission to\r\nalmost every official place in the subordinate administration of that\r\ncountry and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to\r\nthe extent of the labor involved in its preparation and the omission\r\nof Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the\r\nexpenses of the Commission, has been postponed until the present time.\r\nIt is herewith transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile the reform measures of another government are of no authority\r\nfor us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their\r\nintrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and\r\nsocial life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have\r\nheretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil\r\nadministration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged\r\nexperience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of\r\nthe people themselves to cooperate for their removal. The grave evils\r\nand perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office and of\r\noffice tenure are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of\r\nthe great parties, in the reports of Departments, in the debates and\r\nproceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of\r\nthese evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nTo command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be\r\nbased on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the\r\nhealthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential\r\nin a free state.\r\n\r\nWhen the people have approved a policy at a national election,\r\nconfidence on the part of the officers they have selected and of the\r\nadvisers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be\r\nconsulted in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect\r\nis indispensable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it\r\nbefore the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance\r\nof their official duties.\r\n\r\nVery different considerations apply to the greater number of those who\r\nfill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility\r\nis to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey\r\nthe legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved,\r\nand their best public service consists in the discharge of their\r\nfunctions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the\r\nsame whatever party is in power and whatever policy prevails. As a\r\nconsequence it follows that their tenure of office should not depend\r\non the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but\r\nshould be determined by their capacity to serve the people most\r\nusefully quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same\r\nconsiderations that should govern the tenure should also prevail in\r\nthe appointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The\r\nauthority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may\r\nbe used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust, to be\r\nexercised in the public interest under all the sanctions which attend\r\nthe obligation to apply the public funds only for public purposes.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of\r\nentering the public service of his country. The only just ground of\r\ndiscrimination is the measure of character and capacity he has to make\r\nthat service most useful to the people. Except in cases where,\r\nupon just and recognized principles--as upon the theory of\r\npensions--offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past\r\nservices, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal\r\nmerit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of\r\nthat trust subject to which the appointing power is held.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to\r\nprovide just and adequate means, especially for every Department and\r\nlarge administrative office, where personal discrimination on the part\r\nof its head is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications\r\nto which appointments and removals should have reference. To fail to\r\nprovide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining\r\nthe facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends,\r\nbut of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over\r\nappointments and removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it is\r\nthe right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment and the\r\ninterest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that\r\na wise and just method of ascertaining personal fitness for office\r\nmust be an important and permanent function of every just and wise\r\ngovernment. It has long since become impossible in the great offices\r\nfor those having the duty of nomination and appointment to personally\r\nexamine into the individual qualifications of more than a small\r\nproportion of those seeking office, and with the enlargement of the\r\ncivil service that proportion must continue to become less.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were so\r\nfew in number that it was quite easy for those making appointments\r\nand promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates.\r\nParty managers and methods had not then become powerful agencies of\r\ncoercion, hostile to the free and just exercise of the appointing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nA large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil\r\nservice to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President,\r\nand it is my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such\r\nprudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly\r\nbring about that radical change of system essential to make our\r\nadministrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people.\r\nBy a proper exercise of authority it is in the power of the Executive\r\nto do much to promote such a reform. But it can not be too clearly\r\nunderstood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without\r\ncooperation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent\r\nsupport among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally\r\naccepted theories of parties and demand changes in the methods of\r\nDepartments are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations\r\nmust be laid in sound principles and in an experience which\r\ndemonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries.\r\nEvery worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an\r\nhonor to his country; but the people themselves, far more than their\r\nofficers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and\r\nvigorous administration.\r\n\r\nBy laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated\r\nin the Revised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the\r\nseveral subordinate grades in the great Departments was condemned, and\r\nexaminations as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of\r\nexaminers, were provided for and made conditions of admission to\r\nthe public service. These statutes are a decision by Congress that\r\nexaminations of some sort as to attainments and capacity are essential\r\nto the well-being of the public service. The important questions since\r\nthe enactment of these laws have been as to the character of these\r\nexaminations, and whether official favor and partisan influence or\r\ncommon right and merit were to control the access to the examinations.\r\nIn practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy\r\npersons generally who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism\r\nand partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those\r\nwho alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting\r\neven the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates\r\nvery difficult to resist. As a consequence the standard of admission\r\nfell below that which the public interest demanded. It was also almost\r\ninevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of\r\nexaminers, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure,\r\nshould result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of\r\ncapacity, highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and\r\nmore radical change was obviously required.\r\n\r\nIn the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and\r\n  heads of Departments as that of appointments, nor is there\r\n  any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and\r\n  Representatives as that of finding places for constituents.\r\n  The present system does not secure the best men, and often not\r\n  even fit men, for public place. The elevation and purification\r\n  of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with\r\n  approval by the whole people of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress accordingly passed the act approved March 3, 1871, \"to\r\nregulate the civil service of the United States and promote the\r\nefficiency thereof,\" giving the necessary authority to the Executive\r\nto inaugurate a civil-service reform.\r\n\r\nActing under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure\r\na system of just and effectual examinations under uniform supervision,\r\na number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose,\r\nwho entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared\r\nwith an intelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service\r\nthe regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and\r\nwho in their capacity as a board have been known as the \"Civil Service\r\nCommission.\" Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for\r\nthe compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Commission submitted to the\r\nPresident in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various\r\nsections of the country, and that an appropriation of about $25,000\r\nwould be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries,\r\ninvolved in discharging the duties of the Commission. The report was\r\ntransmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the\r\nfollowing favorable comment upon the labors of the Commission:\r\n\r\n  If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, after\r\n  the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still\r\n  more materially benefit the public service and relieve the\r\n  Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of Departments\r\n  from influences prejudicial to good administration. The\r\n  rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have resulted\r\n  beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of\r\n  the Cabinet and their subordinates in the Departments, and in\r\n  that opinion I concur.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in the annual message of December of the same year similar views\r\nare expressed and an appropriation for continuing the work of the\r\nCommission again advised.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation was not made, and as a consequence the active work\r\nof the Commission was suspended, leaving the Commission itself still\r\nin existence. Without the means, therefore, of causing qualifications\r\nto be tested in any systematic manner or of securing for the public\r\nservice the advantages of competition upon any extensive plan, I\r\nrecommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an\r\nappropriation for the resumption of the work of the Commission.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many\r\nembarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in\r\nthe Executive Departments in Washington and in a number of the\r\ncustom-houses and post-offices of the principal cities of the country,\r\nwith a view to further test their effects, and in every instance they\r\nhave been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been\r\nunder the Administration of my predecessor. I think the economy,\r\npurity, and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted\r\nby their systematic introduction, wherever practicable, throughout the\r\nentire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision\r\nfor their general supervision in order to secure consistency and\r\nuniform justice.\r\n\r\nReports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the\r\nPostmaster-General, from the postmaster in the city of New York, where\r\nsuch examinations have been some time on trial, and also from the\r\ncollector of the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor in that\r\ncity, and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other\r\nlarge cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has in\r\nvarious ways contributed to improve the public service.\r\n\r\nThe reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked\r\ndegree, and that the general application of similar rules can not fail\r\nto be of decided benefit to the service.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Government officers, in the city of New York\r\nespecially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive\r\nexaminations in their respective offices, showing that--\r\n\r\n  These examinations and the excellent qualifications of\r\n  those admitted to the service through them have had a marked\r\n  incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service,\r\n  and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has\r\n  been on the part of these latter an increased interest in the\r\n  work and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the\r\n  particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire\r\n  force has been raised. * * * The examinations have been\r\n  attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to\r\n  thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests\r\n  and the method of determining the results, and those visitors\r\n  have without exception approved the methods employed, and\r\n  several of them have publicly attested their favorable\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon such considerations I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation\r\ncontained in my annual message of December, 1877, requesting Congress\r\nto make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work of\r\nthe Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing\r\na moderate compensation to persons in the public service who may\r\nperform extra labor upon or under the Commission, as the Executive may\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit is enforced\r\nfor admission to the public service and in making promotions such\r\nabuses as removals without good cause and partisan and official\r\ninterference with the proper exercise of the appointing power will in\r\nlarge measure disappear.\r\n\r\nThere are other administrative abuses to which the attention\r\nof Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan\r\nappointments and the constant peril of removal without cause very\r\nnaturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on\r\nthe part of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with the\r\ndue discharge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom\r\nof elections. Not without warrant in the views of several of my\r\npredecessors in the Presidential office, and directly within the law\r\nof 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regulation made on the 22d\r\nday of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It\r\nmay not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary, to define with\r\nprecision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal\r\nofficers. But while their right to hold and freely express their\r\nopinions can not be questioned, it is very plain that they should\r\nneither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the\r\nproper discharge of their official duties nor to use the authority of\r\ntheir office to enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political\r\naction of those who hold different opinions.\r\n\r\nReasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which\r\nforbid the use of official power for the oppression of the private\r\ncitizen impose upon the Government the duty of protecting its officers\r\nand agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered,\r\nthe practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries\r\nof officers is highly demoralizing to the public service and\r\ndiscreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as\r\nany other citizen to give his own money in aid of his opinions or his\r\nparty, he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to\r\nmake such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time\r\nand labor of the officer, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon\r\nthem. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax,\r\nthe excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds.\r\n\r\nI recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present\r\nstatutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or\r\npublic employment the protection with which a great and enlightened\r\nnation should guard those who are faithful in its service.\r\n\r\nOur relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of\r\nthe local laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincial\r\nauthorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty\r\nto American fishermen. The United States minister in London has been\r\ninstructed to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view of the damages\r\nreceived by American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of\r\nJanuary, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the\r\nBritish Government, and an early reply is anticipated.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of the necessary preliminary examinations the\r\nsubject of our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated\r\nby treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British\r\nGovernment, with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the\r\nwhole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found\r\ninjurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSome correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and\r\nsaving of life and property upon the Lakes, which has resulted in\r\nimportant modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion\r\ngovernment on the subject in the interest of humanity and commerce.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of\r\nCongress, commissioners were appointed to represent the United States\r\nat the two international exhibitions in Australia, one of which is\r\nnow in progress at Sydney, and the other to be held next year\r\nat Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by our merchants and\r\nmanufacturers interested in the important and growing trade with\r\nAustralia that an increased provision should be made by Congress for\r\nthe representation of our industries at the Melbourne exhibition of\r\nnext year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the\r\ncoast of Massachusetts of a new and independent transatlantic cable\r\nbetween France, by way of the French island of St. Pierre, and this\r\ncountry, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject.\r\nThe conditions imposed before allowing this connection with our shores\r\nto be established are such as to secure its competition with any\r\nexisting or future lines of marine cable and preclude amalgamation\r\ntherewith, to provide for entire equality of rights to our Government\r\nand people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent\r\nany exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the\r\ndisadvantage of any future cable communication between France and the\r\nUnited States which may be projected and accomplished by our citizens.\r\nAn important reduction of the present rates of cable communication\r\nwith Europe, felt to be too burdensome to the interests of our\r\ncommerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of this\r\ncompeting line.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of some general\r\nregulation by Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cables by\r\nmy predecessor in his message of December 7, 1875, and I respectfully\r\nsubmit to your consideration the importance of Congressional action in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nThe questions of grave importance with Spain growing out of the\r\nincidents of the Cuban insurrection have been for the most part\r\nhappily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that\r\nthe commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private\r\ncases in this connection will soon be able to bring its labors to a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing question of East Florida claims has lately been\r\nrenewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require\r\nCongressional action for its final disposition.\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Netherlands with respect to consular rights and\r\nprivileges similar to those with other powers has been signed and\r\nratified, and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st of July\r\nlast. Negotiations for extradition treaties with the Netherlands and\r\nwith Denmark are now in progress.\r\n\r\nSome questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict\r\nemigrants have arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be\r\narranged upon a just and satisfactory basis. A question has also\r\noccurred with respect to an asserted claim by Swiss municipal\r\nauthorities to exercise tutelage over persons and property of Swiss\r\ncitizens naturalized in this country. It is possible this may require\r\nadjustment by treaty.\r\n\r\nWith the German Empire frequent questions arise in connection with\r\nthe subjects of naturalization and expatriation, but the Imperial\r\nGovernment has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and\r\ncomply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the omission of Congress to provide for a diplomatic\r\nrepresentative at Athens, the legation to Greece has been withdrawn.\r\nThere is now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two\r\ncountries, and the expediency of providing for one in some form is\r\nsubmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nRelations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium\r\ncontinue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial importance.\r\n\r\nA change of the personal head of the Government of Egypt has taken\r\nplace. No change, however, has occurred in the relations between\r\nEgypt and the United States. The action of the Egyptian Government in\r\npresenting to the city of New York one of the ancient obelisks, which\r\npossess such historic interest, is highly appreciated as a generous\r\nmark of international regard. If prosperity should attend the\r\nenterprise of its transportation across the Atlantic, its erection in\r\na conspicuous position in the chief commercial city of the nation will\r\nsoon be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in regard\r\nto the revision of former commercial treaties it is now believed will\r\nbe followed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The\r\nattention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity\r\nfunds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with\r\ntheir accumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. If any\r\npart of these funds is justly due to American citizens, they should\r\nreceive it promptly; and whatever may have been received by this\r\nGovernment in excess of strictly just demands should in some form be\r\nreturned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs.\r\n\r\nThe Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the\r\nquestion of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with\r\na dispassionate fairness and to cooperate in such measures as may\r\ntend to prevent injurious consequences to the United States. The\r\nnegotiations are still proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence.\r\n\r\nA question having arisen between China and Japan about the Lew Chew\r\nIslands, the United States Government has taken measures to inform\r\nthose powers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the\r\nmaintenance of peace if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find\r\nit practicable to avail themselves of the proffer.\r\n\r\nIt is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the\r\njudicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two\r\nnations on each side of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of\r\ntheir respective Governments, raids and depredations have greatly\r\ndecreased, and in the localities where formerly most destructive\r\nhave now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a\r\nconfident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will\r\nsoon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present\r\norders to our military commanders as to crossing the border, without\r\nencouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe third installment of the award against Mexico under the claims\r\ncommission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course\r\nof distribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the\r\nsame. This satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me\r\nto anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased\r\ncontribution of capital and industry by our people to the development\r\nof the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the\r\nwisdom of Congress the provision of suitable legislation looking to\r\nthis result.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again fully restored by the\r\narrival of a minister from that country to the United States. This\r\nis especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an\r\ninteroceanic canal has recently assumed a new and important aspect and\r\nis now under discussion with the Central American countries through\r\nwhose territory the canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to pass.\r\nIt is trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their part will see\r\nthat the early prosecution of such a work will largely inure to\r\nthe benefit, not only of their own citizens and those of the United\r\nStates, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted\r\nthat should the work be undertaken under the protective auspices of\r\nthe United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of\r\nway and its security by the Central American Governments, the capital\r\nfor its completion would be readily furnished from this country and\r\nEurope, which might, failing such guaranties, prove inaccessible.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations with Chile have also been strengthened by the\r\nreception of a minister from that country.\r\n\r\nThe war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chile still continues. The United\r\nStates have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further\r\nthan to convey to all the Governments concerned the assurance that\r\nthe friendly offices of the Government of the United States for the\r\nrestoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be extended in case\r\nthe belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them.\r\n\r\nCordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and\r\ntrade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and\r\nmore frequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the\r\nports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me\r\nto deserve the attention of Congress as an essential precursor of an\r\nenlargement of our commerce with them and an extension of our carrying\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nA recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the\r\nestablishment of a provisional government. This government has not\r\nyet been formally recognized, and it is deemed desirable to await\r\nthe proposed action of the people which is expected to give it the\r\nsanction of constitutional forms.\r\n\r\nA naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan Islands to make surveys and\r\ntake possession of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa\r\nin the harbor of Pago-Pago. A coaling station is to be established\r\nthere, which will be convenient and useful to United States vessels.\r\n\r\nThe subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumania and\r\nServia, now become independent sovereignties, is at present under\r\nconsideration, and is the subject of diplomatic correspondence.\r\n\r\nThere is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and\r\nAmerican countries, and it is believed that with judicious action in\r\nregard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced and\r\nthat American products and manufactures will find new and expanding\r\nmarkets. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers upon this\r\nsubject, under the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining\r\nmuch valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid\r\nbefore Congress and the public from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe third article of the treaty with Russia of March 30, 1867,\r\nby which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that\r\nthe inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the\r\nuncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all\r\nthe rights of citizens of the United States and shall be maintained\r\nand protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property,\r\nand religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and\r\nregulations as the United States may from time to time adopt in regard\r\nto the aboriginal tribes of that country.\r\n\r\nBoth the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people\r\nrequire that some organized form of government over the Territory of\r\nAlaska be adopted.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with\r\ncommon-law offenses, such as assault, robbery, and murder, and no\r\nmagistrate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases.\r\nSerious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this\r\ncharacter, not only among the original inhabitants, but among citizens\r\nof the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining,\r\nfishing, and other business operations within the territory. A bill\r\nauthorizing the appointment of justices of the peace and constables\r\nand the arrest and detention of persons charged with criminal\r\noffenses, and providing for an appeal to United States courts for\r\nthe district of Oregon in suitable cases, will at a proper time be\r\nsubmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury on the condition of the public finances.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June\r\n30, 1879, were $273,827,184.46; the ordinary expenditures for the same\r\nperiod were $266,947,883.53, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of\r\n$6,879,300.93.\r\n\r\nThe receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, actual\r\nand estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter,\r\ncommencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated receipts for the\r\nremaining three quarters of the year, $208,156,336.39; total receipts\r\nfor the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as\r\nfollows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures,\r\n$91,683,385.10; and for the remaining three quarters of the year\r\nthe expenditures are estimated at $172,316,614.90, making the total\r\nexpenditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue\r\nfor the year ending June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total receipts\r\nduring the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1881, estimated according\r\nto existing laws, will be $288,000,000, and the estimated ordinary\r\nexpenditures for the same period will be $278,097,364.39, leaving a\r\nsurplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year.\r\n\r\nThe large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the last and\r\nthe present fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented\r\nthe application of the full amount required by law to the sinking\r\nfund for the current year; but these arrears having been substantially\r\npaid, it is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained\r\nwithout any change of existing law.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being\r\nfor a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress\r\nfrom that Department during a period of at least twelve years.\r\n\r\nHe concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such\r\nlegislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full number\r\nof 25,000 men for the line of the Army, exclusive of the 3,463 men\r\nrequired for detached duty, and therefore not available for service in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for\r\nthe disposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and\r\nreservations, which, though very valuable in themselves, have been\r\nrendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civilization\r\nand settlement.\r\n\r\nHe unites with the Quartermaster-General in recommending that an\r\nappropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly\r\nfireproof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money\r\naccounts, vouchers, claims, and other valuable records now in the\r\nQuartermaster-General's Office, and exposed to great risk of total\r\ndestruction by fire.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends, in conformity with the views of the\r\nJudge-Advocate-General, some declaratory legislation in reference\r\nto the military statute of limitations as applied to the crime of\r\ndesertion.\r\n\r\nIn these several recommendations I concur.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War further reports that the work for the improvement\r\nof the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr.\r\nJames B. Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been\r\nprosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in\r\nthe attainment of results than during any previous year. The channel\r\nthrough the South Pass, which at the beginning of operations in June,\r\n1875, had a depth of only 7-1/2 feet of water, had on the 8th of July,\r\n1879, a minimum depth of 26 feet, having a width of not less than\r\n200 feet and a central depth of 30 feet. Payments have been made in\r\naccordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to $4,250,000; and further payments will become due, as\r\nprovided by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the\r\nchannel now secured.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates\r\npresent a full and detailed account of the military operations for\r\nthe suppression of hostilities among the Indians of the Ute and\r\nApache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the officers and troops\r\nengaged for promptness, skill, and courage displayed.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the\r\nMexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of\r\nthis Government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will\r\nprove permanently successful.\r\n\r\nThis Department was enabled during the past year to find temporary,\r\nthough crowded, accommodations and a safe depository for a portion of\r\nits records in the completed east wing of the building designed for\r\nthe State, War, and Navy Departments. The construction of the north\r\nwing of the building, a part of the structure intended for the use\r\nof the War Department, is being carried forward with all possible\r\ndispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal\r\nappropriations as will secure its speedy completion.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement\r\nin that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive\r\nrepairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been\r\ncompleted and made ready for sea.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including\r\nspecific appropriations not estimated for by the Department, were\r\n$13,555,710.09. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting\r\nthe amount of these specific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79; but\r\nthis is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been\r\ndrawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of\r\nappropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17.\r\nThere was, therefore, a balance of $1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended\r\nand to the credit of the Department on June 30, 1879. The estimates\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $14,864,147.95, which\r\nexceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $361,897.28.\r\nThe reason for this increase is explained in the Secretary's\r\nreport. The appropriations available for the present fiscal year are\r\n$14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary, answer\r\nall the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the\r\nTreasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879 was $5,770,404.12, of which\r\n$1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that\r\nperiod $4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds\r\nof the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, there\r\nwill remain unexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of the\r\ncurrent appropriations. The report of the Secretary shows the\r\ngratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the Pay\r\nCorps of the Navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of\r\na single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the removal of the\r\nobservatory to a more healthful location. That institution reflects\r\ncredit upon the nation, and has obtained the approbation of scientific\r\nmen in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present location\r\nwould not only be conducive to the health of its officers and\r\nprofessors, but would greatly increase its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been\r\nmade for the Department of Justice in gross, was subdivided at the\r\nlast session of Congress, and no appropriation whatever was made for\r\nthe payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the\r\nservice of process or for the discharge of other duties; and since\r\nJune 30 these officers have continued the performance of their duties\r\nwithout compensation from the Government, taking upon themselves the\r\nnecessary incidental outlays, as well as rendering their own services.\r\nIn only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of the\r\nprocess of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the\r\nrequisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on the part\r\nof these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised\r\nby the Attorney-General, who informed them, however, that they would\r\nnecessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the prospect of\r\nfuture legislation by Congress. I therefore especially recommend that\r\nimmediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe act making the principal appropriation for the Department of\r\nJustice at previous sessions has uniformly contained the following\r\nclause:\r\n\r\n  And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the\r\n  enforcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled\r\n  \"An act to amend an act approved May 31, 1870, entitled 'An\r\n  act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States\r\n  to vote in the several States of this Union, and for other\r\n  purposes,'\" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary\r\n  thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no\r\ngeneral election for Members of Congress occurred, the omission was\r\na matter of little practical importance. Such election will, however,\r\ntake place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation made for\r\nthe pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to embrace\r\ncompensation for the services they may be required to perform at such\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Supreme Court is at present largely in arrears.\r\nIt can not be expected that more causes can be decided than are\r\nnow disposed of in its annual session, or that by any assiduity the\r\ndistinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more\r\nthan is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits also the\r\nbusiness has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice\r\nwill call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is\r\nbelieved that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected\r\nfrom its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily\r\nfelt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes\r\nare advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the\r\ndiscussion of questions of a public character.\r\n\r\nThe remedy suggested by the Attorney-General is the appointment of\r\nadditional circuit judges and the creation of an intermediate court of\r\nerrors and appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part\r\nof its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the\r\nperformance of circuit duties.\r\n\r\nI commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would\r\nseem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional\r\ncircuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of\r\nsalaries, of not more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be\r\nsmall in comparison with the objects to be attained.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General bears testimony to the general\r\nrevival of business throughout the country. The receipts of the\r\nPost-Office Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879,\r\nwere $30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than the revenues of the\r\npreceding year. The amount realized from the sale of postage stamps,\r\nstamped envelopes, and postal cards was $764,465.91 more than in the\r\npreceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditures\r\nof the Department were $33,449,899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.63\r\nwas paid on liabilities incurred in preceding years.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the year were $801,209.77 less than in the\r\npreceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the\r\noperation of the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation\r\nof postmasters from a commission on the value of stamps sold to a\r\ncommission on stamps canceled.\r\n\r\nThe amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to\r\nthe revenues of the Department, was $3,031,454.96, being $2,276,197.86\r\nless than in the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are\r\nestimated at $39,920,900 and the receipts from all sources at\r\n$32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the\r\nTreasury of $7,710,900.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Department with railroad companies have been\r\nharmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their\r\ncompensation by the appropriation for special facilities, and the\r\nrailway post-office lines have been greatly extended, especially in\r\nthe Southern States. The interests of the Railway Mail Service and\r\nof the public would be greatly promoted and the expenditures could be\r\nmore readily controlled by the classification of the employees of the\r\nRailway Mail Service as recommended by the Postmaster-General, the\r\nappropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is\r\nalready fixed by law, to be made in gross.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of the law regulating\r\nthe increase of compensation for increased service and increased speed\r\non star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for\r\nsuch increased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to\r\naccrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of a general\r\nlaw authorizing contracts with American-built steamers, carrying the\r\nAmerican flag, for transporting the mail between ports of the United\r\nStates and ports of the West Indies and South America, at a fixed\r\nmaximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by\r\nannual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the\r\ndomestic star service.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement made by the Postmaster-General and the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury for the collection of duty upon books received in\r\nthe mail from foreign countries has proved so satisfactory in its\r\npractical operation that the recommendation is now made that Congress\r\nshall extend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which\r\nthis arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable\r\narticles received in the mails from foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations\r\nwith the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance\r\ntheir civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved\r\nby them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general\r\nconduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the\r\noccurrence of two disturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and\r\ndestruction of property, is all the more to be lamented.\r\n\r\nThe history of the outbreak on the White River Ute Reservation, in\r\nwestern Colorado, has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the\r\npublic press that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here\r\nin detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will\r\nlead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact\r\nbetween the Indians and the border settlements in western Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico,\r\nwhere Victoria, at the head of a small band of marauders, after\r\ncommitting many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military\r\nforce, made his way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWhile these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of\r\nIndians were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our\r\nIndian population have fully justified the expectations of those who\r\nbelieve that by humane and peaceful influences the Indian can be led\r\nto abandon the habits of savage life and to develop a capacity for\r\nuseful and civilized occupations. What they have already accomplished\r\nin the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable\r\nsuccess which has attended the experiment of employing as freighters\r\na class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most\r\nintractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for\r\nthe education of their children may be taken as sufficient proof that\r\nthey will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they continue\r\nto be wisely and fairly guided. The \"Indian policy\" sketched in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to\r\nmake liberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle\r\nthe Indians upon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to\r\ntheir farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their\r\nwants are thus provided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their\r\nreservations not occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out\r\nof the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually\r\nrelieve the Government of the expenses now provided for by annual\r\nappropriations, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the\r\nIndians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which\r\nthe existence of large reservations presents to the settlement and\r\ndevelopment of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the\r\nenactment of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title in\r\nfee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to\r\nthem by allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first\r\nannual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give\r\nsatisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their\r\nfamilies for a number of years, and who are willing to detach\r\nthemselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the\r\nhomestead act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision\r\nof inalienability for a certain period.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of sending a number of Indian children of both sexes to\r\nthe Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive\r\nan elementary English education and practical instruction in farming\r\nand other useful industries, has led to results so promising that it\r\nwas thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle,\r\nin Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department for the establishment of\r\nan Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now 158 pupils,\r\nselected from various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements\r\nare also made for the education of a number of Indian boys and girls\r\nbelonging to tribes on the Pacific Slope in a similar manner, at\r\nForest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to\r\nthe liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic munificence of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nLast spring information was received of the organization of an\r\nextensive movement in the Western States, the object of which was\r\nthe occupation by unauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian\r\nTerritory ceded by the Cherokees to the Government for the purpose of\r\nsettlement by other Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of April I issued a proclamation[40] warning all persons\r\nagainst participation in such an attempt, and by the cooperation of a\r\nmilitary force the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to\r\nprotect the rights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the\r\nfull extent of the executive power; but it would be unwise to ignore\r\nthe fact that a territory so large and so fertile, with a population\r\nso sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be\r\nfound more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened\r\nthis year when the surrounding States are more densely settled and the\r\nwestward movement of our population looks still more eagerly for\r\nfresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances the difficulty of\r\nmaintaining the Indian Territory in its present state will greatly\r\nincrease, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare\r\nfor such a contingency. I therefore fully approve of the advice given\r\nto them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to\r\ndivide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their\r\nlands as they can cultivate; to acquire individual title in fee\r\ninstead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider\r\nin what manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the\r\nGovernment for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would\r\nmore certainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions,\r\nand at the same time promote their progress in civilization and\r\nprosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state of\r\nthings in the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe question whether a change in the control of the Indian service\r\nshould be made was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint\r\ncommittee of both Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual\r\nmessage I expressed the hope that the decision of that question, then\r\nin prospect, would \"arrest further agitation of this subject, such\r\nagitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as\r\nwell as on the Indians themselves.\" Since then, the committee having\r\nreported, the question has been decided in the negative by a vote in\r\nthe House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that further\r\nuncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other\r\nmuch-needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and\r\nto unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government and\r\nimprovement of the Indians, I respectfully recommend that the decision\r\narrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand.\r\n\r\nThe efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the\r\ndepredations on the timber lands of the United States have been\r\ncontinued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of\r\ncases of trespass have been prosecuted in the courts of the United\r\nStates; others have been settled, the trespassers offering to make\r\npayment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them.\r\nThe proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turned into the\r\nTreasury far exceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for\r\nthis purpose. A more important result, however, consists in the fact\r\nthat the destruction of our public forests by depredation, although\r\nsuch cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it\r\nis probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and\r\nsufficient provision to that end is made by Congress such trespasses,\r\nat least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except\r\nin the Territories, where timber for the daily requirements of the\r\npopulation can not, under the present state of the law, be otherwise\r\nobtained. I therefore earnestly invite the attention of Congress to\r\nthe recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a law\r\nbe enacted enabling the Government to sell timber from the public\r\nlands without conveying the fee, where such lands are principally\r\nvaluable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to\r\nconform to domestic wants and business requirements, while at the\r\nsame time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The\r\nenactment of such a law appears to become a more pressing necessity\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of\r\nenlarging the facilities of the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture\r\nis the leading interest and the permanent industry of our people. It\r\nis to the abundance of agricultural production, as compared with our\r\nhome consumption, and the largely increased and highly profitable\r\nmarket abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are\r\nmainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look\r\nfor its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource.\r\nThere is no branch of industry in which labor, directed by scientific\r\nknowledge, yields such increased production in comparison with\r\nunskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the\r\nencouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately\r\nextended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy,\r\nbut, on the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums\r\nannually that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the\r\nGovernment to promote this vital interest.\r\n\r\nThe results already accomplished with the very limited means\r\nheretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture is\r\nan earnest of what may be expected with increased appropriations for\r\nthe several purposes indicated in the report of the Commissioner, with\r\na view to placing the Department upon a footing which will enable it\r\nto prosecute more effectively the objects for which it is established.\r\n\r\nAppropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the\r\nestablishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, and\r\nfor an increase of force.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report\r\nof the Commissioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the\r\nDepartment, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country\r\ncan not with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to\r\nwhich educational privileges throughout the United States have been\r\nadvanced during the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests\r\nupon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial\r\naid to education, supplemental to local action in the States and\r\nTerritories and in the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of\r\nthe founders of our Government has not only furnished the basis for\r\nthe support of the common-school systems of the newer States, but laid\r\nthe foundations for the maintenance of their universities and colleges\r\nof agriculture and the mechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this\r\ntraditional policy, for the further benefit of all these interests and\r\nthe extension of the same advantages to every portion of the country,\r\nit is hoped will receive your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nTo preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among the\r\nforemost cares of the National Legislature. The library gathered at\r\nthe Capitol still remains unprovided with any suitable accommodations\r\nfor its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the\r\ncollection, increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of\r\ncopyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific\r\nlibrary of the Smithsonian Institution, call for building\r\naccommodations which shall be at once adequate and fireproof. The\r\nlocation of such a public building, which should provide for the\r\npressing necessities of the present and for the vast increase of the\r\nnation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses itself to\r\nthe discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as a measure\r\nwhich should unite all suffrages and which should no longer be\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876,\r\nfor the purpose of supervising and directing the completion of the\r\nWashington National Monument, of which commission the President is a\r\nmember, has given careful attention to this subject, and already the\r\nstrengthening of the foundation has so far progressed as to insure the\r\nentire success of this part of the work. A massive layer of masonry\r\nhas been introduced below the original foundation, widening the base,\r\nincreasing the stability of the structure, and rendering it possible\r\nto carry the shaft to completion. It is earnestly recommended that\r\nsuch further appropriations be made for the continued prosecution\r\nof the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national\r\nmonument at an early day.\r\n\r\nIn former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject,\r\nI have taken occasion to commend to Congress the adoption of a\r\ngenerous policy toward the District of Columbia. The report of\r\nthe Commissioners of the District, herewith transmitted, contains\r\nsuggestions and recommendations, to all of which I earnestly invite\r\nyour careful attention. I ask your early and favorable consideration\r\nof the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation\r\nfor the reclamation of the marshes of the Potomac and its Eastern\r\nBranch within the limits of the city, and for the repair of the\r\nstreets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks and now by\r\ndecay rendered almost impassable and a source of imminent danger\r\nto the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the\r\nCommissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these\r\nimportant works, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations\r\nfrom the Federal Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe filling of the flats in front of the city will add to the adjacent\r\nlands and parks now owned by the United States a large and valuable\r\ndomain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and\r\nwill also, as an incidental result, secure the permanent improvement\r\nof the river for the purposes of navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution having invested Congress with supreme and exclusive\r\njurisdiction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of\r\nnecessity look to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting\r\ntheir interests; and as the territory of this District is the common\r\nproperty of the people of the United States, who equally with its\r\nresident citizens are interested in the prosperity of their capital,\r\nI can not doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice\r\nof the country in any measures you may adopt for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of\r\nthe public schools of this District, as exhibited in the report of the\r\nCommissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing,\r\nno adequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of school\r\naccommodation, and the Commissioners are without the means to meet\r\nthis urgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school\r\npurposes are rented, and are in important particulars unsuited for the\r\npurpose. The cause of popular education in the District of Columbia is\r\nsurely entitled to the same consideration at the hands of the\r\nNational Government as in the several States and Territories, to which\r\nmunificent grants of the public lands have been made for the endowment\r\nof schools and universities.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: See pp. 547-548.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 19, 1879_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a draft of a bill submitted\r\nby the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, entitled\r\n\"A bill to provide for the reclamation of the marshes in the harbors\r\nof the cities of Washington and Georgetown, and for other purposes,\"\r\ntogether with the accompanying letter of the president of the board\r\nrequesting its transmission to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe bill embraces a plan for the reclamation of the marshes of the\r\nPotomac River and its Eastern Branch within the limits of the city\r\nof Washington, and is carefully framed with a view to economy in the\r\nprosecution of the work. The attention of Congress is again invited to\r\nthe urgent need of legislation for this important work, which has been\r\nso long delayed.\r\n\r\nThe improvement contemplated is essential to the health of those who\r\nreside, whether permanently or temporarily, at the capital, and to\r\nthe safe and convenient navigation of the waters in its vicinity by\r\nvessels employed in the service of the Government and for the purposes\r\nof commerce. It is a measure of more than local benefit. The capital\r\nof the nation should be relieved from every disadvantage which it is\r\npracticable to remove, and should possess every attraction with which\r\nit can be invested by the intelligent and fostering care of those\r\nwho are intrusted with its immediate supervision. The people of the\r\ncountry will sustain and approve the efforts of their representatives\r\nin the discharge of this responsibility.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 14, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to transmit the final report of the board\r\nfor testing iron, steel, and other metals, with the accompanying\r\npapers. These papers constitute the remainder of the reports made\r\nby the board, which were transmitted by me to the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the 15th of June, 1878 (House Ex. Doc. No. 98,\r\nForty-fifth Congress, second session).\r\n\r\nThe United States testing machine at Watertown Arsenal, constructed\r\nfor the board, is reported as being of great value in the\r\ndetermination of data and the solution of problems of interest to the\r\npeople of the whole country, and the special attention of Congress\r\nis called to the necessity of an appropriation to enable the War\r\nDepartment to make use of it. An estimate of $20,000 for the purpose\r\nwas submitted to Congress in the last Book of Estimates (see p. 82),\r\nand an appropriation of that sum is respectfully recommended.\r\n\r\nThe act of July 31, 1876 (19 U.S. Statutes at Large, ch. 246, p. 119),\r\nmade an appropriation for completing the experiments in testing\r\niron, steel, and other metals, and provided that the board should\r\nbe discontinued from and after the expenditure of the amount\r\nappropriated. In accordance with this legislation, the board ceased to\r\nexist on the 30th of June, 1879.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to invite the attention of Congress to the subject of\r\nthe unsettled claims of Spanish inhabitants of East Florida during the\r\nyears of 1812 and 1813, generally known as the \"East Florida claims,\"\r\nthe settlement of which is provided for by a stipulation found in\r\nArticle IX of the treaty of February, 1819, between the United States\r\nand Spain. The provision of the treaty in question which relates to\r\nthe subject is the following:\r\n\r\n  The United States will cause satisfaction to be made for the\r\n  injuries, if any, which by process of law shall be established\r\n  to have been suffered by the Spanish officers and individual\r\n  Spanish inhabitants by the late operations of the American\r\n  army in Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1823 (3 U.S. Statutes at\r\nLarge, p. 768), to carry into effect the ninth article of the treaty\r\nin question, provided for the examination and judicial ascertainment\r\nof the claims by the judges of the superior courts established at St.\r\nAugustine and Pensacola, and also made provision for the payment by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury of such claims as might be reported to\r\nhim by the said judges, upon his being satisfied that such claims were\r\njust and equitable; and a subsequent act, approved the 26th of June,\r\n1834 (6 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 569), gave further directions for\r\nthe payment, and also provided for the hearing and determination by\r\nthe judge of the superior court of St. Augustine of such claims as\r\nhad not then been already heard and determined. Under these acts\r\nof Congress I understand that all claims presented to the judges in\r\nFlorida were passed upon and the result of the proceedings thus had\r\nreported to the Secretary of the Treasury. It also appears that in\r\nthe computation of damages the judges adopted a rule of 5 per cent per\r\nannum on the ascertained actual loss from the date of that loss to the\r\ntime of the rendition of their finding, and that the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury in 1836, when the first reports were presented to him, not\r\ndeeming this portion of the claims covered by the 5 per cent rule\r\njust and equitable within the meaning of the treaty and the acts of\r\nCongress, refused to pay it, but did continue to pay the ascertained\r\namounts of actual loss. The demand for payment of this rejected\r\nitem has been pressed at various times and in various ways up to the\r\npresent time, but Mr. Woodbury's successors in the Treasury Department\r\nhave not felt at liberty to review that ruling.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have thought it proper to lay the subject\r\nbefore Congress for its consideration and such action as may be deemed\r\nnecessary. The history of the proceedings already had in regard to the\r\nmatter is of record in the Treasury Department, and will be furnished\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury should Congress desire it.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 8, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State and the\r\naccompanying papers, in response to the resolution adopted by the\r\nSenate on the 11th day of February last, requesting copies of all\r\ncorrespondence between this Government and any foreign government\r\nsince February, 1869, respecting a ship canal across the isthmus\r\nbetween North America and South America, together with copies of any\r\n_projet_ of treaties respecting the same which the Department of State\r\nmay have proposed or submitted since that date to any foreign power or\r\nits diplomatic representative.\r\n\r\nIn further compliance with the resolution of the Senate, I deem it\r\nproper to state briefly my opinion as to the policy of the United\r\nStates with respect to the construction of an interoceanic canal by\r\nany route across the American Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe policy of this country is a canal under American control. The\r\nUnited States can not consent to the surrender of this control to any\r\nEuropean power or to any combination of European powers. If existing\r\ntreaties between the United States and other nations or if the rights\r\nof sovereignty or property of other nations stand in the way of this\r\npolicy--a contingency which is not apprehended--suitable steps should\r\nbe taken by just and liberal negotiations to promote and establish the\r\nAmerican policy on this subject consistently with the rights of the\r\nnations to be affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe capital invested by corporations or citizens of other countries in\r\nsuch an enterprise must in a great degree look for protection to\r\none or more of the great powers of the world. No European power\r\ncan intervene for such protection without adopting measures on this\r\ncontinent which the United States would deem wholly inadmissible. If\r\nthe protection of the United States is relied upon, the United States\r\nmust exercise such control as will enable this country to protect\r\nits national interests and maintain the rights of those whose private\r\ncapital is embarked in the work.\r\n\r\nAn interoceanic canal across the American Isthmus will essentially\r\nchange the geographical relations between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\ncoasts of the United States and between the United States and the rest\r\nof the world. It would be the great ocean thoroughfare between our\r\nAtlantic and our Pacific shores, and virtually a part of the coast\r\nline of the United States. Our merely commercial interest in it is\r\ngreater than that of all other countries, while its relations to our\r\npower and prosperity as a nation, to our means of defense, our unity,\r\npeace, and safety, are matters of paramount concern to the people\r\nof the United States. No other great power would under similar\r\ncircumstances fail to assert a rightful control over a work so closely\r\nand vitally affecting its interest and welfare.\r\n\r\nWithout urging further the grounds of my opinion, I repeat, in\r\nconclusion, that it is the right and the duty of the United States\r\nto assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any\r\ninteroceanic canal across the isthmus that connects North and South\r\nAmerica as will protect our national interests. This, I am quite sure,\r\nwill be found not only compatible with but promotive of the widest and\r\nmost permanent advantage to commerce and civilization.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B.

HAYES,\r\n  _President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I have been privileged to bring with me from Boston, as a\r\npresent to the United States, a very precious historical relic. It is\r\nthe little desk on which Mr. Jefferson wrote the original draft of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThis desk was given by Mr. Jefferson himself to my friend, the late\r\nJoseph Coolidge, of Boston, at the time of his marriage to Jefferson's\r\ngranddaughter, Miss Randolph, and it bears an autograph inscription\r\nof singular interest, written by the illustrious author of the\r\nDeclaration in the very last year of his life.\r\n\r\nOn the recent death of Mr. Coolidge, whose wife had died a year or\r\ntwo previously, the desk became the property of their children, Mr.\r\nJ. Randolph Coolidge, Dr. Algernon Coolidge, Mr. Thomas Jefferson\r\nCoolidge, and Mrs. Ellen Dwight, who now desire to offer it to\r\nthe United States, so that it may henceforth have a place in the\r\nDepartment of State in connection with the immortal instrument which\r\nwas written upon it in 1776.\r\n\r\nThey have done me the honor to make me the medium of this\r\ndistinguished gift, and I ask permission to place it in the hands of\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of the nation in their name and at their request.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Mr. President, with the highest respect, very\r\nfaithfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBT.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 4, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter mature consideration of the bill entitled \"An act making\r\nappropriations to supply certain deficiencies in the appropriations\r\nfor the service of the Government for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1880, and for other purposes,\" I return it to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which it originated, with my objections to its\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nThe bill appropriates about $8,000,000, of which over $600,000 is for\r\nthe payment of the fees of United States marshals and of the general\r\nand special deputy marshals earned during the current fiscal year,\r\nand their incidental expenses. The appropriations made in the bill are\r\nneeded to carry on the operations of the Government and to fulfill its\r\nobligations for the payment of money long since due to its officers\r\nfor services and expenses essential to the execution of their\r\nduties under the laws of the United States. The necessity for these\r\nappropriations is so urgent and they have been already so long\r\ndelayed that if the bill before me contained no permanent or general\r\nlegislation unconnected with these appropriations it would receive\r\nmy prompt approval. It contains, however, provisions which materially\r\nchange, and by implication repeal, important parts of the laws for the\r\nregulation of the United States elections. These laws have for several\r\nyears past been the subject of vehement political controversy, and\r\nhave been denounced as unnecessary, oppressive, and unconstitutional.\r\nOn the other hand, it has been maintained with equal zeal and\r\nearnestness that the election laws are indispensable to fair and\r\nlawful elections, and are clearly warranted by the Constitution.\r\nUnder these circumstances, to attempt in an appropriation bill the\r\nmodification or repeal of these laws is to annex a condition to the\r\npassage of needed and proper appropriations, which tends to deprive\r\nthe Executive of that equal and independent exercise of discretion and\r\njudgment which the Constitution contemplates.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the bill, therefore, to which I respectfully ask your\r\nattention is that it gives a marked and deliberate sanction, attended\r\nby no circumstances of pressing necessity, to the questionable and,\r\nas I am clearly of opinion, the dangerous practice of tacking upon\r\nappropriation bills general and permanent legislation. This practice\r\nopens a wide door to hasty, inconsiderate, and sinister legislation.\r\nIt invites attacks upon the independence and constitutional powers of\r\nthe Executive by providing an easy and effective way of constraining\r\nExecutive discretion. Although of late this practice has been resorted\r\nto by all political parties when clothed with power, it did not\r\nprevail until forty years after the adoption of the Constitution, and\r\nit is confidently believed that it is condemned by the enlightened\r\njudgment of the country. The States which have adopted new\r\nconstitutions during the last quarter of a century have generally\r\nprovided remedies for the evil. Many of them have enacted that no law\r\nshall contain more than one subject, which shall be plainly expressed\r\nin its title. The constitutions of more than half of the States\r\ncontain substantially this provision, or some other of like intent and\r\nmeaning. The public welfare will be promoted in many ways by a return\r\nto the early practice of the Government and to the true rule of\r\nlegislation, which is that every measure should stand upon its own\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nI am firmly convinced that appropriation bills ought not to contain\r\nany legislation not relevant to the application or expenditure of the\r\nmoney thereby appropriated, and that by a strict adherence to this\r\nprinciple an important and much needed reform will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nPlacing my objection to the bill on this feature of its frame,\r\nI forbear any comment upon the important general and permanent\r\nlegislation which it contains, as matter for specific and independent\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 15, 1880_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAfter mature consideration of the bill entitled \"An act regulating the\r\npay and appointment of deputy marshals,\" I am constrained to withhold\r\nfrom it my approval, and to return it to the Senate, in which it\r\noriginated, with my objections to its passage.\r\n\r\nThe laws now in force on the subject of the bill before me are\r\ncontained in the following sections of the Revised Statutes:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2021. Whenever an election at which Representatives or\r\n  Delegates in Congress are to be chosen is held in any city\r\n  or town of 20,000 inhabitants or upward, the marshal for the\r\n  district in which the city or town is situated shall, on the\r\n  application in writing of at least two citizens residing in\r\n  such city or town, appoint special deputy marshals, whose\r\n  duty it shall be, when required thereto, to aid and assist\r\n  the supervisors of election in the verification of any list\r\n  of persons who may have registered or voted; to attend in each\r\n  election district or voting precinct at the times and places\r\n  fixed for the registration of voters, and at all times\r\n  or places when and where the registration may by law be\r\n  scrutinized and the names of registered voters be marked\r\n  for challenge; and also to attend, at all times for holding\r\n  elections, the polls in such district or precinct.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2022. The marshal and his general deputies, and such\r\n  special deputies, shall keep the peace and support and protect\r\n  the supervisors of election in the discharge of their duties,\r\n  preserve order at such places of registration and at such\r\n  polls, prevent fraudulent registration and fraudulent voting\r\n  thereat, or fraudulent conduct on the part of any officer of\r\n  election, and immediately, either at the place of registration\r\n  or polling place, or elsewhere, and either before or after\r\n  registering or voting, to arrest and take into custody, with\r\n  or without process, any person who commits, or attempts or\r\n  offers to commit, any of the acts or offenses prohibited\r\n  herein, or who commits any offense against the laws of the\r\n  United States; but no person shall be arrested without process\r\n  for any offense not committed in the presence of the marshal\r\n  or his general or special deputies, or either of them, or of\r\n  the supervisors of election, or either of them; and for\r\n  the purposes of arrest or the preservation of the peace the\r\n  supervisors of election shall, in the absence of the marshal's\r\n  deputies, or if required to assist such deputies, have the\r\n  same duties and powers as deputy marshals; nor shall any\r\n  person, on the day of such election, be arrested without\r\n  process for any offense committed on the day of registration.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2023. Whenever any arrest is made under any provision of\r\n  this title, the person so arrested shall forthwith be brought\r\n  before a commissioner, judge, or court of the United States\r\n  for examination of the offenses alleged against him; and such\r\n  commissioner, judge, or court shall proceed in respect thereto\r\n  as authorized by law in case of crimes against the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2024. The marshal or his general deputies, or such\r\n  special deputies as are thereto specially empowered by him in\r\n  writing, and under his hand and seal, whenever he or either\r\n  or any of them is forcibly resisted in executing their duties\r\n  under this title, or shall by violence, threats, or menaces\r\n  be prevented from executing such duties or from arresting any\r\n  person who has committed any offense for which the marshal\r\n  or his general or his special deputies are authorized to make\r\n  such arrest, are, and each of them is, empowered to summon\r\n  and call to his aid the bystanders or _posse comitatus_ of his\r\n  district.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2028. No person shall be appointed a supervisor of\r\n  election or a deputy marshal under the preceding provisions\r\n  who is not at the time of his appointment a qualified voter of\r\n  the city, town, county, parish, election district, or voting\r\n  precinct in which his duties are to be performed.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5521. If any person be appointed a supervisor of election\r\n  or a special deputy marshal under the provisions of title \"The\r\n  elective franchise,\" and has taken the oath of office as such\r\n  supervisor of election or such special deputy marshal, and\r\n  thereafter neglects or refuses, without good and lawful\r\n  excuse, to perform and discharge fully the duties,\r\n  obligations, and requirements of such office until the\r\n  expiration of the term for which he was appointed, he shall\r\n  not only be subject to removal from office with loss of all\r\n  pay or emoluments, but shall be punished by imprisonment for\r\n  not less than six months nor more than one year, or by a fine\r\n  of not less than $200 and not more than $500, or by both fine\r\n  and imprisonment, and shall pay the costs of prosecution.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5522. Every person, whether with or without any\r\n  authority, power, or process, or pretended authority, power,\r\n  or process, of any State, Territory, or municipality, who\r\n  obstructs, hinders, assaults, or by bribery, solicitation,\r\n  or otherwise interferes with or prevents the supervisors of\r\n  election, or either of them, or the marshal or his general or\r\n  special deputies, or either of them, in the performance of any\r\n  duty required of them, or either of them, or which he or they,\r\n  or either of them, may be authorized to perform by any law of\r\n  the United States, in the execution of process or otherwise,\r\n  or who by any of the means before mentioned hinders or\r\n  prevents the free attendance and presence at such places of\r\n  registration, or at such polls of election, or full and free\r\n  access and egress to and from any such place of registration\r\n  or poll of election, or in going to and from any such place\r\n  of registration or poll of election, or to and from any room\r\n  where any such registration or election or canvass of votes,\r\n  or of making any returns or certificates thereof, may be had,\r\n  or who molests, interferes with, removes, or ejects from\r\n  any such place of registration or poll of election, or\r\n  of canvassing votes cast thereat, or of making returns or\r\n  certificates thereof, any supervisor of election, the marshal\r\n  or his general or special deputies, or either of them, or\r\n  who threatens, or attempts or offers so to do, or refuses or\r\n  neglects to aid and assist any supervisor of election, or the\r\n  marshal or his general or special deputies, or either of them,\r\n  in the performance of his or their duties, when required\r\n  by him or them, or either of them, to give such aid and\r\n  assistance, shall be liable to instant arrest without process,\r\n  and shall be punished by imprisonment not more than two years,\r\n  or by a fine of not more than $3,000, or by both such fine and\r\n  imprisonment, and shall pay the cost of the prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, in the recent case of _Ex\r\nparte_ Siebold and others, decided at the October term, 1879, on\r\nthe question raised in the case as to the constitutionality of the\r\nsections of the Revised Statutes above quoted, uses the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n  These portions of the Revised Statutes are taken from the act\r\n  commonly known as the enforcement act, approved May 31, 1870,\r\n  and entitled \"An act to enforce the right of citizens of the\r\n  United States to vote in the several States of this Union,\r\n  and for other purposes,\" and from the supplement to that\r\n  act, approved February 28, 1871. They relate to elections of\r\n  members of the House of Representatives, and were an assertion\r\n  on the part of Congress of a power to pass laws for regulating\r\n  and superintending said elections and for securing the purity\r\n  thereof and the rights of citizens to vote thereat peaceably\r\n  and without molestation.\r\n\r\n  It must be conceded to be a most important power, and of a\r\n  fundamental character. In the light of recent history and of\r\n  the violence, fraud, corruption, and irregularity which have\r\n  frequently prevailed at such elections, it may easily be\r\n  conceived that the exertion of the power, if it exists, may be\r\n  necessary to the stability of our form of government.\r\n\r\n  The greatest difficulty in coming to a just conclusion arises\r\n  from mistaken notions with regard to the relations which\r\n  subsist between the State and National Governments. * * *\r\n\r\n  It seems to be often overlooked that a national constitution\r\n  has been adopted in this country, establishing a real\r\n  government therein, operating upon persons and territory and\r\n  things, and which, moreover, is, or should be, as dear to\r\n  every American citizen as his State government is. Whenever\r\n  the true conception of the nature of this Government is\r\n  once conceded, no real difficulty will arise in the just\r\n  interpretation of its powers; but if we allow ourselves to\r\n  regard it as a hostile organization, opposed to the proper\r\n  sovereignty and dignity of the State governments, we shall\r\n  continue to be vexed with difficulties as to its jurisdiction\r\n  and authority. No greater jealousy is required to be exercised\r\n  toward this Government in reference to the preservation of\r\n  our liberties than is proper to be exercised toward the State\r\n  governments. Its powers are limited in number and clearly\r\n  defined, and its action within the scope of those powers is\r\n  restrained by a sufficiently rigid bill of rights for the\r\n  protection of its citizens from oppression. The true interests\r\n  of the people of this country require that both the National\r\n  and State Governments should be allowed, without jealous\r\n  interference on either side, to exercise all the powers which\r\n  respectively belong to them according to a fair and practical\r\n  construction of the Constitution. State rights and the rights\r\n  of the United States should be equally respected. Both\r\n  are essential to the preservation of our liberties and\r\n  the perpetuity of our institutions. But in endeavoring to\r\n  vindicate the one we should not allow our zeal to nullify or\r\n  impair the other. * * *\r\n\r\n  The true doctrine, as we conceive, is this, that while the\r\n  States are really sovereign as to all matters which have not\r\n  been granted to the jurisdiction and control of the United\r\n  States, the Constitution and constitutional laws of the latter\r\n  are, as we have already said, the supreme law of the land,\r\n  and when they conflict with the laws of the States they are\r\n  of paramount authority and obligation. This is the fundamental\r\n  principle on which the authority of the Constitution is based,\r\n  and unless it be conceded in practice as well as theory the\r\n  fabric of our institutions, as it was contemplated by its\r\n  founders, can not stand. The questions involved have respect\r\n  not more to the autonomy and existence of the States than to\r\n  the continued existence of the United States as a government\r\n  to which every American citizen may look for security and\r\n  protection in every part of the land. * * *\r\n\r\n  Why do we have marshals at all if they can not physically lay\r\n  their hands on persons and things in the performance of their\r\n  proper duties? What functions can they perform if they can not\r\n  use force? In executing the process of the courts must they\r\n  call on the nearest constable for protection? Must they rely\r\n  on him to use the requisite compulsion and to keep the peace\r\n  while they are soliciting and entreating the parties and\r\n  bystanders to allow the law to take its course? This is the\r\n  necessary consequence of the positions that are assumed. If\r\n  we indulge in such impracticable views as these, and keep\r\n  on refining and re-refining, we shall drive the National\r\n  Government out of the United States and relegate it to the\r\n  District of Columbia, or perhaps to some foreign soil. We\r\n  shall bring it back to a condition of greater helplessness\r\n  than that of the old Confederation.\r\n\r\n  The argument is based on a strained and impracticable view\r\n  of the nature and powers of the National Government. It must\r\n  execute its powers or it is no government. It must execute\r\n  them on the land as well as on the sea, on things as well as\r\n  on persons. And to do this it must necessarily have power to\r\n  command obedience, preserve order, and keep the peace; and\r\n  no person or power in this land has the right to resist or\r\n  question its authority so long as it keeps within the bounds\r\n  of its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have deemed it fitting and proper to quote thus largely from an\r\nimportant and elaborate opinion of the Supreme Court because the bill\r\nbefore me proceeds upon a construction of the Constitution as to the\r\npowers of the National Government which is in direct conflict with the\r\njudgment of the highest judicial tribunal of our country.\r\n\r\nUnder the sections of the present law above quoted officers of the\r\nUnited States are authorized, and it is their duty in the case of\r\nCongressional elections, to keep the peace at the polls and at the\r\nplaces of registration; to arrest immediately any person who is guilty\r\nof crimes against the United States election laws; to protect all\r\nofficers of elections in the performance of their duties; and\r\nwhenever an arrest is made to bring the person so arrested before a\r\ncommissioner, judge, or court of the United States for examination of\r\nthe offenses alleged against him. \"Such special deputy marshals as are\r\nspecially empowered thereto by the marshal in writing,\" if forcibly\r\nresisted, may call to their aid the bystanders or _posse comitatus_.\r\nIt is made a crime punishable with fine or imprisonment to hinder,\r\nassault, or otherwise interfere with the marshal or \"his special\r\ndeputies,\" or to threaten or to attempt so to do. If any person\r\nappointed such special deputy marshal has taken the oath of office and\r\nthereafter neglects or refuses to fully discharge the duties of such\r\noffice, he is punishable not only by removal from office, but by fine\r\nand imprisonment. The functions of the special deputy marshals\r\nnow provided for by law being executive, they are placed under the\r\nauthority of the well-known chief executive officer of the courts\r\nof the United States. They are in fact, and not merely in name, the\r\ndeputies of the marshal, and he and his bondsmen are responsible for\r\nthem. A civil force for the execution of the law is thus instituted in\r\naccordance with long-established and familiar usage, which is simple,\r\neffective, and under a responsible head. The necessity for the\r\npossession of these powers by appropriate officers will not be called\r\nin question by intelligent citizens who appreciate the importance of\r\npeaceable, orderly, and lawful elections. Similar powers are conferred\r\nand exercised under State laws with respect to State elections. The\r\nexecutive officers of the United States under the existing laws have\r\nno other or greater power to supervise and control the conduct of the\r\nCongressional elections than the State executive officers exercise in\r\nregard to State elections.\r\n\r\nThe bill before me changes completely the present law by substituting\r\nfor the special deputy marshals of the existing statutes new officers\r\nhitherto unknown to the law, and who lack the power, responsibility,\r\nand protection which are essential to enable them to act efficiently\r\nas executive officers.\r\n\r\nThe bill under consideration is as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of\r\n  the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n  from and after the passage of this act the pay of all deputy\r\n  marshals for services in reference to any election shall be $5\r\n  for each day of actual service, and no more.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. That all deputy marshals to serve in reference to any\r\n  election shall be appointed by the circuit court of the United\r\n  States for the district in which such marshals are to perform\r\n  their duties in each year; and the judges of the several\r\n  circuit courts of the United States are hereby authorized to\r\n  open their respective courts at any time for that purpose; and\r\n  in case the circuit courts shall not be open for that purpose\r\n  at least ten days prior to a registration, if there be one,\r\n  or, if no registration be required, then at least ten days\r\n  before such election, the judges of the district courts of\r\n  the United States are hereby respectively authorized to cause\r\n  their courts to be opened for the purpose of appointing such\r\n  deputy marshals, who shall be appointed by the said district\r\n  courts; and the officers so appointed shall be in equal\r\n  numbers from the different political parties, and shall be\r\n  well-known citizens, of good moral character, and actual\r\n  residents of the voting precincts in which their duties are\r\n  to be performed, and shall not be candidates for any office\r\n  at such election; and all laws and parts of laws inconsistent\r\n  with this act are hereby repealed: _Provided_, That the\r\n  marshals of the United States for whom deputies shall be\r\n  appointed by the court under this act shall not be liable for\r\n  any of the acts of such deputies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the deputy marshals proposed by the bill\r\nbefore me are distinctly different officers from the special deputies\r\nof the marshal, as such officers are now provided for in the statutes.\r\nThis bill does not connect the new officers with the existing laws\r\nrelating to special deputy marshals so as to invest the proposed\r\ndeputy marshals with the same powers, to impose upon them the same\r\nduties, and to give them the same protection by means of the criminal\r\nlaws. When new officers are created, distinct in character and\r\nappointed by different authority, although similar in name to\r\nofficers already provided for, such officers are not held by similar\r\nresponsibilities to the criminal law, do not possess the same powers,\r\nand are not similarly protected unless it is expressly so provided by\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe so-called deputy marshals provided for in this bill will have no\r\nexecutive head. The marshal can neither appoint nor remove them. He\r\ncan not control them, and he is not responsible for them. They will\r\nhave no authority to call to their aid, if resisted, the _posse\r\ncomitatus_. They are protected by no criminal statutes in the\r\nperformance of their duties. An assault upon one of these deputies\r\nwith the intent to prevent a lawful election will be no more than an\r\nordinary assault upon any other citizen. They can not keep the peace.\r\nThey can not make arrests when crimes are committed in their presence.\r\nWhatever powers they have are confined to the precincts in which they\r\nreside. Outside of the precincts for which they are appointed the\r\ndeputy marshals of this bill can not keep the peace, make arrests,\r\nhold prisoners, take prisoners before a proper tribunal for hearing,\r\nnor perform any other duty. No oaths of office are required of them,\r\nand they give no bond. They have no superior who is responsible for\r\nthem, and they are not punishable for neglect of duty or misconduct in\r\noffice. In all these respects this bill makes a radical change between\r\nthe powers of the United States officers at national elections and the\r\npowers uniformly possessed and exercised by State officers at State\r\nelections. This discrimination against the authority of the United\r\nStates is a departure from the usage of the Government established by\r\nprecedents beginning with the earliest statutes on the subject, and\r\nviolates the true principles of the Constitution. The Supreme Court,\r\nin the decision already referred to, says:\r\n\r\n  It is argued that the preservation of peace and good order in\r\n  society is not within the powers confided to the Government of\r\n  the United States, but belongs exclusively to the States. Here\r\n  again we are met with the theory that the Government of the\r\n  United States does not rest upon the soil and territory of\r\n  the country. We think that this theory is founded on an entire\r\n  misconception of the nature and powers of that Government.\r\n  We hold it to be an incontrovertible principle that the\r\n  Government of the United States may, by means of physical\r\n  force, exercised through its official agents, execute on every\r\n  foot of American soil the powers and functions that belong to\r\n  it. This necessarily involves the power to command obedience\r\n  to its laws, and hence the power to keep the peace to that\r\n  extent.\r\n\r\n  This power to enforce its laws and to execute its functions\r\n  in all places does not derogate from the power of the State to\r\n  execute its laws at the same time and in the same places. The\r\n  one does not exclude the other, except where both can not\r\n  be executed at the same time. In that case the words of the\r\n  Constitution itself show which is to yield. \"This Constitution\r\n  and all laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof * * *\r\n  shall be the supreme law of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is proper to say that no objection would be made to\r\nthe appointment of officers to act with reference to the elections by\r\nthe courts of the United States, and that I am in favor of appointing\r\nofficers to supervise and protect the elections without regard to\r\nparty; but the bill before me, while it recognizes the power and duty\r\nof the United States to provide officers to guard and scrutinize the\r\nCongressional elections, fails to adapt its provisions to the existing\r\nlaws so as to secure efficient supervision and protection. It is\r\ntherefore returned to the Senate, in which it originated, for that\r\nfurther consideration which is contemplated by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B.

By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during\r\nthe past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable\r\nemployment for all our people, and with contentment at home, and\r\nwith peace and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of\r\nthe twenty-fourth election of Chief Magistrate has afforded another\r\nopportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the world\r\na significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the\r\npower and authority of government from the public servants whose terms\r\nof office are about to expire to their newly chosen successors. This\r\nexample can not fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other\r\ncountries with the advantages which republican institutions afford.\r\nThe immediate, general, and cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens\r\nin the result of the election gives gratifying assurance to our\r\ncountry and to its friends throughout the world that a government\r\nbased on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people\r\npossesses elements of strength, stability, and permanency not found in\r\nany other form of government.\r\n\r\nContinued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of\r\ncitizenship conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments\r\nto the Constitution still prevails in several of the late slaveholding\r\nStates. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent election to\r\nany large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however,\r\nby fraudulent practices in connection with the ballots, with the\r\nregulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with counting,\r\nreturning, and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in defeating\r\nthe exercise of the right preservative of all rights--the right\r\nof suffrage--which the Constitution expressly confers upon our\r\nenfranchised citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire of the good people of the whole country that\r\nsectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. They prefer\r\nthat no section of the country should be united in solid opposition\r\nto any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty\r\nobedience to the equal-rights amendments to the Constitution is all\r\nthat now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional\r\nlines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments\r\nis flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that\r\nthe people who placed them in the Constitution, as embodying the\r\nlegitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to\r\nbe wise and necessary, will continue to act together and to insist\r\nthat they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the\r\nenjoyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite\r\nqualifications to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly\r\ncounted. With this question rightly settled, the country will be\r\nrelieved of the contentions of the past; bygones will indeed be\r\nbygones, and political and party issues, with respect to economy\r\nand efficiency of administration, internal improvements, the tariff,\r\ndomestic taxation, education, finance, and other important subjects,\r\nwill then receive their full share of attention; but resistance to\r\nand nullification of the results of the war will unite together in\r\nresolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of\r\nthe Government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately\r\nappreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination\r\nproceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the\r\npeople of our country or to any of their interests. The inviolability\r\nof the amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our\r\nGovernment. They are the solemn expression of the will of the people\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must\r\nbe maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the\r\nGovernment of the country. Happily, the history of the late election\r\nshows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the\r\nfifteenth amendment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is\r\nlikely to cease altogether if firm and well-considered action is taken\r\nby Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate,\r\nwhich have the right to judge of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of their own members, will see to it that every case\r\nof violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment is\r\nthoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall\r\naccrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the Executive,\r\nwith sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute\r\nunsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the\r\nrights guaranteed to them by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guaranty\r\nof the primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity\r\nfor self-protection which can belong only to a people whose right to\r\nuniversal suffrage is supported by universal education. The means\r\nat the command of the local and State authorities are in many cases\r\nwholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it.\r\nThis is especially true where before emancipation the education of the\r\npeople was neglected or prevented, in the interest of slavery. Firmly\r\nconvinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest\r\nattention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise\r\nand comprehensive action by the Government of the United States, I\r\nrespectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable legislation and\r\nwith proper safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in\r\nthe several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of\r\ncitizenship have been devolved on uneducated people by devoting to\r\nthe purpose grants of the public lands and, if necessary, by\r\nappropriations from the Treasury of the United States. Whatever\r\nGovernment can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be\r\ndone. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue, and social\r\norder prevail and civil and religious liberty are secure.\r\n\r\nIn my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to\r\nthe urgent necessity of a reformation of the civil-service system\r\nof the Government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage,\r\nor appointments for personal or partisan considerations, have been\r\nstrengthened by my observation and experience in the Executive office,\r\nand I believe these dangers threaten the stability of the Government.\r\nAbuses so serious in their nature can not be permanently tolerated.\r\nThey tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of\r\nadministrative service, as the growth of the country in population\r\nincreases the number of officers and placemen employed.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the\r\nregulation of appointments, promotions, and removals, establishing\r\na uniform method having exclusively in view in every instance the\r\nattainment of the best qualifications for the position in question.\r\nSuch a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all\r\ncitizens and the most economical and efficient administration of the\r\npublic business.\r\n\r\nCompetitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and\r\npromotions have been conducted for some years past in several of\r\nthe Executive Departments, and by my direction this system has been\r\nadopted in the custom-houses and post-offices of the larger cities of\r\nthe country. In the city of New York over 2,000 positions in the civil\r\nservice have been subject in their appointments and tenure of place to\r\nthe operation of published rules for this purpose during the past\r\ntwo years. The results of these practical trials have been very\r\nsatisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system of\r\nselection. All are subjected to the same tests, and the result is free\r\nfrom prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for\r\nthe position applied for the best qualifications attainable among the\r\ncompeting applicants. It is an effectual protection from the pressure\r\nof importunity, which under any other course pursued largely exacts\r\nthe time and attention of appointing officers, to their great\r\ndetriment in the discharge of other official duties, preventing the\r\nabuse of the service for the mere furtherance of private or party\r\npurposes, and leaving the employee of the Government, freed from the\r\nobligations imposed by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for\r\nretention and advancement, and with this constant incentive to\r\nexertion and improvement.\r\n\r\nThese invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the\r\noffices where the rules for appointment by competitive examination\r\nhave been applied.\r\n\r\nA method which has so approved itself by experimental tests at\r\npoints where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive should be\r\nextended to all subordinate positions under the Government. I believe\r\nthat a strong and growing public sentiment demands immediate measures\r\nfor securing and enforcing the highest possible efficiency in the\r\ncivil service and its protection from recognized abuses, and that\r\nthe experience referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe examinations in the custom-houses and post-offices have been held\r\nunder many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for\r\nthe extra labor performed by the officers who have conducted them, and\r\nwhose commendable interest in the improvement of the public service\r\nhas induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward.\r\nA continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to be expected,\r\nand without an appropriation by Congress for compensation it is not\r\npracticable to extend the system of examinations generally throughout\r\nthe civil service. It is also highly important that all such\r\nexaminations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under\r\ngeneral supervision. Section 1753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes\r\nthe President to prescribe the regulations for admission to the civil\r\nservice of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable\r\npersons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to \"the\r\nfitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character,\r\nknowledge, and ability for the branch of service into which he seeks\r\nto enter;\" but the law is practically inoperative for want of the\r\nrequisite appropriation.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meet\r\nthe expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the President in\r\naccordance with the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be\r\nto devise a just, uniform, and efficient system of competitive\r\nexaminations and to supervise the application of the same throughout\r\nthe entire civil service of the Government. I am persuaded that the\r\nfacilities which such a commission will afford for testing the fitness\r\nof those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief\r\nto members of Congress as it will be to the President and heads of\r\nDepartments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes\r\nof embarrassment which now inevitably and constantly attend the\r\nconflicting claims of patronage between the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competition\r\nof influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of office will\r\nbe the substitution of an open competition of merit between the\r\napplicants, in which everyone can make his own record with the\r\nassurance that his success will depend upon this alone.\r\n\r\nI also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as\r\nfree as any other citizen to express his political opinions and to use\r\nhis means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe\r\nas any private citizen in refusing all demands upon his salary for\r\npolitical purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty\r\nand justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise\r\ncontain stringent provisions against the use of official authority\r\nto coerce the political action of private citizens or of official\r\nsubordinates, is greatly to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil\r\nservice, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and\r\nremoval, has been found to be the practice, under what is known as\r\nthe spoils system, by which the appointing power has been so largely\r\nencroached upon by members of Congress. The first step in the reform\r\nof the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and\r\nthe Executive in the matter of appointments. The corrupting\r\ndoctrine that \"to the victors belong the spoils\" is inseparable\r\nfrom Congressional patronage as the established rule and practice of\r\nparties in power. It comes to be understood by applicants for office\r\nand by the people generally that Representatives and Senators are\r\nentitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts and\r\nStates. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting\r\nfrom this invasion of the Executive functions. The true principles of\r\nGovernment on the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the\r\nnational conventions of the leading parties of the country, have again\r\nand again been approved by the American people, and have not been\r\ncalled in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of\r\npublic opinion upon this all-important subject are the statement\r\nof principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n  Under the Constitution the President and heads of Departments\r\n  are to make nominations for office. The Senate is to advise\r\n  and consent to appointments, and the House of Representatives\r\n  is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best\r\n  interest of the public service demands that these distinctions\r\n  be respected; that Senators and Representatives, who may\r\n  be judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to\r\n  office.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this end the cooperation of the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment is required alike by the necessities of the case and by\r\npublic opinion. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the\r\ndemands made upon them with reference to appointments to office until\r\nby legislative enactment the pernicious practice is condemned and\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended that an act be passed defining the\r\nrelations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to office\r\nby the President; and I also recommend that the provisions of section\r\n1767 and of the sections following of the Revised Statutes, comprising\r\nthe tenure-of-office act of March 2, 1867, be repealed.\r\n\r\nBelieving that to reform the system and methods of the civil service\r\nin our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties\r\nof statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by the\r\ncooperation of the legislative and executive departments of the\r\nGovernment, I again commend the whole subject to your considerate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United\r\nStates to suppress polygamy where it now exists in our Territories and\r\nto prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made\r\nby the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against\r\nit. Experience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be\r\neffective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer\r\naction is delayed the more difficult it will be to accomplish what\r\nis desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon\r\nsectarian organization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of\r\nmaking and executing the local legislation of the Territory. By its\r\ncontrol of the grand and petit juries it possesses large influence\r\nover the administration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this\r\nsect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to\r\nmake effective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject\r\nof polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will\r\nnot be abolished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who\r\npractice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking\r\naway the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it.\r\n\r\nThe power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the\r\nTerritories is ample. It is not a case for halfway measures. The\r\npolitical power of the Mormon sect is increasing. It controls now\r\none of our wealthiest and most populous Territories. It is extending\r\nsteadily into other Territories. Wherever it goes it establishes\r\npolygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and\r\nthe family relation are the corner stone of our American society and\r\ncivilization. Religious liberty and the separation of church and state\r\nare among the elementary ideas of free institutions. To reestablish\r\nthe interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have\r\nimperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants\r\nof all creeds that part of our domain which has been in a great degree\r\nclosed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions,\r\nit is recommended that the government of the Territory of Utah be\r\nreorganized.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a\r\ngovernor and judges, or commissioners, appointed by the President and\r\nconfirmed by the Senate--a government analogous to the provisional\r\ngovernment established for the territory northwest of the Ohio by\r\nthe ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the\r\nexisting form of local government, I recommend that the right to vote,\r\nhold office, and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to\r\nthose who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures\r\nare adopted, it is believed that within a few years the evils which\r\nnow afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that this Territory will in\r\ngood time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new\r\nStates of the Union.\r\n\r\nOur relations with all foreign countries have been those of\r\nundisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to\r\ntheir continued maintenance.\r\n\r\nMy anticipation of an early reply from the British Government to the\r\ndemand of indemnity to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by that\r\nindustry at Fortune Bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in my last\r\nannual message, was disappointed. This answer was received only in the\r\nlatter part of April in the present year, and when received exhibited\r\na failure of accord between the two Governments as to the measure of\r\nthe inshore fishing privilege secured to our fishermen by the treaty\r\nof Washington of so serious a character that I made it the subject of\r\na communication to Congress, in which I recommended the adoption of\r\nthe measures which seemed to me proper to be taken by this Government\r\nin maintenance of the rights accorded to our fishermen under the\r\ntreaty and toward securing an indemnity for the injury these interests\r\nhad suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under\r\nconsideration by the House of Representatives at the time of the\r\nadjournment of Congress in June last.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment renewing the consideration of the subject, both of the\r\nindemnity for the injuries at Fortune Bay and of the interpretation\r\nof the treaty in which the previous correspondence had shown the two\r\nGovernments to be at variance. Upon both these topics the disposition\r\ntoward a friendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our\r\nright to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the\r\nmeasure of such indemnity to further conference, and by an assent to\r\nthe view of this Government, presented in the previous correspondence,\r\nthat the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery\r\nof the provincial seacoasts and the vessel fishery of our fishermen\r\nshould be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement\r\nbetween the two Governments.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment\r\nof the very serious divergence of views in the interpretation of\r\nthe fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington, which, as the\r\ncorrespondence between the two Governments stood at the close of the\r\nlast session of Congress, seemed to be irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nIn the important exhibition of arts and industries which was held last\r\nyear at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress\r\nat Melbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably\r\nrepresented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place\r\nreceived a large number of awards in some of the most considerable\r\ndepartments, and the participation of the United States was recognized\r\nby a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the\r\nshare taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of\r\nsuccess is confidently expected.\r\n\r\nThe state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations\r\nof the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our\r\ndiplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have concluded and\r\nratified a convention with the French Republic for the settlement of\r\nclaims of the citizens of either country against the other. Under this\r\nconvention a commission, presided over by a distinguished publicist,\r\nappointed in pursuance of the request of both nations by His Majesty\r\nthe Emperor of Brazil, has been organized and has begun its sessions\r\nin this city. A congress to consider means for the protection of\r\nindustrial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which\r\nI have appointed the ministers of the United States in France and in\r\nBelgium as delegates. The International Commission upon Weights and\r\nMeasures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your attention to\r\nthe necessity of an appropriation to be made in time to enable\r\nthis Government to comply with its obligations under the metrical\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nOur friendly relations with the German Empire continue without\r\ninterruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish\r\nand Fisheries at Berlin the participation of the United States,\r\nnotwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make\r\nits preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning\r\nfor private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class and for the\r\ncountry at large the principal prize of honor offered by His Majesty\r\nthe Emperor. The results of this great success can not but be\r\nadvantageous to this important and growing industry. There have been\r\nsome questions raised between the two Governments as to the proper\r\neffect and interpretation of our treaties of naturalization, but\r\nrecent dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that favorable\r\nprogress is making toward an understanding in accordance with the\r\nviews of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction\r\nwhatever between the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen of\r\nthe United States. In practice the complaints of molestation suffered\r\nby naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer than at present.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly\r\nrelations with the Governments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portugal,\r\nSweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, and Greece.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant\r\nmarine of this country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies,\r\nwere fired at, boarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the\r\nSpanish Government. The circumstances as reported involve not only a\r\nprivate injury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too little\r\nobservant of the friendly relations existing for a century between\r\nthis country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of\r\nthe Spanish Government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the\r\nmatter is undergoing investigation by the royal authorities with a\r\nview to such explanation or reparation as may be called for by the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of\r\nour citizens against the Government of Spain is, I hope, approaching\r\nthe termination of its labors.\r\n\r\nThe claims against the United States under the Florida treaty with\r\nSpain were submitted to Congress for its action at the late session,\r\nand I again invite your attention to this long-standing question, with\r\na view to a final disposition of the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the invitation of the Spanish Government, a conference has recently\r\nbeen held at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection\r\nby foreign powers of native Moors in the Empire of Morocco. The\r\nminister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part\r\nin the deliberations of this conference, the result of which is\r\na convention signed on behalf of all the powers represented. The\r\ninstrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. The\r\nGovernment of the United States has also lost no opportunity to urge\r\nupon that of the Emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accordance with\r\nthe humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an end to the\r\npersecutions, which have been so prevalent in that country, of\r\npersons of a faith other than the Moslem, and especially of the Hebrew\r\nresidents of Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been officially\r\npromulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the\r\nSenate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which\r\nthe time allowed for ratification expired. The Senate will be asked to\r\nextend the period for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition with Denmark failed\r\non account of the objection of the Danish Government to the usual\r\nclause providing that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest\r\nof the persons whose extradition it asks.\r\n\r\nThe provision made by Congress at its last session for the expense\r\nof the commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations\r\nwith the Imperial Government of China on subjects of great interest\r\nto the relations of the two countries enabled the commissioners\r\nto proceed at once upon their mission. The Imperial Government was\r\nprepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters\r\nbrought under negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with such\r\nrapidity and success that on the 17th of November last two treaties\r\nwere signed at Peking, one relating to the introduction of Chinese\r\ninto this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of\r\nthe commissioners, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and\r\nit is expected that they will be received in season to be laid before\r\nthe Senate early in January.\r\n\r\nOur minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal\r\nrelief of shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more\r\nupon Congress the propriety of making provision for the erection of\r\nsuitable fireproof buildings at the Japanese capital for the use of\r\nthe American legation and the court-house and jail connected with\r\nit. The Japanese Government, with great generosity and courtesy, has\r\noffered for this purpose an eligible piece of land.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I invited the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject of the indemnity funds received some years ago from China and\r\nJapan. I renew the recommendation then made that whatever portions of\r\nthese funds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid\r\nand the residue returned to the nations, respectively, to which they\r\njustly and equitably belong.\r\n\r\nThe extradition treaty with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which has\r\nbeen for some time in course of negotiation, has during the past year\r\nbeen concluded and duly ratified.\r\n\r\nRelations of friendship and amity have been established between the\r\nGovernment of the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent\r\na diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have received at this\r\ncapital the special envoy who has been charged by His Royal Highness\r\nPrince Charles to announce the independent sovereignty of Roumania. We\r\nhope for a speedy development of commercial relations between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of\r\nquiet on the border between this country and Mexico would soon become\r\nso assured as to justify the modification of the orders then in force\r\nto our military commanders in regard to crossing the frontier, without\r\nencouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two\r\ncountries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations, and the\r\norders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our\r\nown citizens and the Mexican Government. Subsequently the peace of the\r\nborder was again disturbed by a savage foray under the command of\r\nthe Chief Victoria, but by the combined and harmonious action of the\r\nmilitary forces of both countries his band has been broken up and\r\nsubstantially destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the obstacles which have so long\r\nprevented rapid and convenient communication between the United States\r\nand Mexico by railways are on the point of disappearing, and that\r\nseveral important enterprises of this character will soon be set on\r\nfoot, which can not fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of\r\nboth countries.\r\n\r\nNew envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and\r\nNicaragua have recently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and\r\nenlightenment afford the best guaranty of the continuance of friendly\r\nrelations between ourselves and these sister Republics.\r\n\r\nThe relations between this Government and that of the United States of\r\nColombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by\r\nreason of the project of an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, to be built by private capital under a concession from\r\nthe Colombian Government for that purpose. The treaty obligations\r\nsubsisting between the United States and Colombia, by which we\r\nguarantee the neutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and\r\nproperty of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessary that the\r\nconditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced\r\nin this guaranty should be effected--transforming, as it would, this\r\nIsthmus from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans into a\r\ngateway and thoroughfare between them for the navies and the merchant\r\nships of the world--should receive the approval of this Government, as\r\nbeing compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part\r\nand consistent with our interests as the principal commercial power\r\nof the Western Hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a special\r\nmessage to Congress in March last in relation to this project I\r\ndeem it my duty again to press upon your attention. Subsequent\r\nconsideration has but confirmed the opinion \"that it is the right and\r\nduty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision and\r\nauthority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects\r\nNorth and South America as will protect our national interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe war between the Republic of Chile on the one hand and the allied\r\nRepublics of Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues. This\r\nGovernment has not felt called upon to interfere in a contest that is\r\nwithin the belligerent rights of the parties as independent states.\r\nWe have, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in\r\naccommodating their difference, and have at different times reminded\r\nboth belligerents of our willingness to render such service.\r\n\r\nOur good offices in this direction were recently accepted by all the\r\nbelligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious; but I\r\nregret to announce that the measures which the ministers of the United\r\nStates at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take with the view to\r\nbring about a peace were not successful. In the course of the war some\r\nquestions have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all of these the\r\nministers of the United States have, under their instructions, acted\r\nwith promptness and energy in protection of American interests.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with the Empire of Brazil continue\r\nto be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily\r\nincreases, to their mutual advantage.\r\n\r\nThe internal disorders with which the Argentine Republic has for some\r\ntime past been afflicted, and which have more or less influenced its\r\nexternal trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This\r\nhappy result may be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign\r\ncommerce of that Republic, as well as to the development of its vast\r\ninterior resources.\r\n\r\nIn Samoa the Government of King Malietoa, under the support and\r\nrecognition of the consular representatives of the United States,\r\nGreat Britain, and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquillity\r\nto the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole\r\nthe scheme of tripartite local government which has been proposed, the\r\ncommon interests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in\r\ntheir relations to the native frame of government, and this may be\r\nbest secured by a simple diplomatic agreement between them. It would\r\nbe well if the consular jurisdiction of our representative at Apia\r\nwere increased in extent and importance so as to guard American\r\ninterests in the surrounding and outlying islands of Oceanica.\r\n\r\nThe obelisk generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city\r\nof New York has safely arrived in this country, and will soon be\r\nerected in that metropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the\r\nEgyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this Government, at\r\nthe earnest solicitation of the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions\r\nadopted by it, which will be laid before Congress for its information.\r\nA commission for the revision of the judicial code of the\r\nreform tribunal of Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman,\r\nconsul-general, and J.M. Batchelder, esq., have been appointed as\r\ncommissioners to participate in this work. The organization of the\r\nreform tribunals will probably be continued for another period of five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress,\r\ninvitations have been extended to foreign maritime states to join in\r\na sanitary conference in Washington, beginning the 1st of January. The\r\nacceptance of this invitation by many prominent powers gives promise\r\nof success in this important measure, designed to establish a system\r\nof international notification by which the spread of infectious or\r\nepidemic diseases may be more effectively checked or prevented. The\r\nattention of Congress is invited to the necessary appropriations for\r\ncarrying into effect the provisions of the act referred to.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and\r\ncommerce of the United States, through the active agency of consular\r\nofficers and through the dissemination of information obtained from\r\nthem, have been unrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed\r\nin our commercial communities, and the value of the information\r\nsecured by this means to the trade and manufactures of the country\r\nwere recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was\r\nmade for the more frequent publication of consular and other reports\r\nby the Department of State. The first issue of this publication has\r\nnow been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected.\r\nThe importance and interest attached to the reports of consular\r\nofficers are witnessed by the general demand for them by all classes\r\nof merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is\r\nbelieved that the system of such publications is deserving of the\r\napproval of Congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its\r\ncontinuance and enlargement will commend itself to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe prosperous energies of our domestic industries and their immense\r\nproduction of the subjects of foreign commerce invite, and even\r\nrequire, an active development of the wishes and interests of\r\nour people in that direction. Especially important is it that our\r\ncommercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South\r\nAmerica, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico, should be\r\ndirect, and not through the circuit of European systems, and should\r\nbe carried on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the\r\nopportunities which our front on the Pacific Ocean gives to commerce\r\nwith Japan, China, and the East Indies, with Australia and the island\r\ngroups which lie along these routes of navigation, should inspire\r\nequal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping and to administer by\r\nour own capital a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications\r\nof our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful\r\nto meet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges\r\nand of our carrying trade I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be\r\nready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly\r\nuseful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest\r\nattention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular\r\nsteam postal communication by aid from government has been the\r\nforerunner of the commercial predominance of Great Britain on all\r\nthese coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the\r\ndesire and the intent of our people. It is also manifest that the\r\nefforts of other European nations to contend with Great Britain for a\r\nshare of this commerce have been successful in proportion with their\r\nadoption of regular steam postal communication with the markets whose\r\ntrade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious\r\nto receive such postal communication with this country and to aid in\r\ntheir development. Similar cooperation may be looked for in due time\r\nfrom the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see\r\nhow the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests.\r\nIn respect of foreign commerce quite as much as in internal trade\r\npostal communication seems necessarily a matter of common and public\r\nadministration, and thus pertaining to Government. I respectfully\r\nrecommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as\r\nmay conduce to the development of our foreign commercial exchanges and\r\nthe building up of our carrying trade.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service\r\nwhich might be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on\r\nthe Pacific Ocean were a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia\r\nat the south. The great influence of such means of communication on\r\nthese routes of navigation in developing and securing the due share of\r\nour Pacific Coast in the commerce of the world needs no illustration\r\nor enforcement. It may be that such an enterprise, useful, and in the\r\nend profitable, as it would prove to private investment, may need to\r\nbe accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress in its aid, and\r\nI submit the matter to your careful consideration.\r\n\r\nAn additional and not unimportant, although secondary, reason for\r\nfostering and enlarging the Navy may be found in the unquestionable\r\nservice to the expansion of our commerce which would be rendered by\r\nthe frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all\r\nquarters of the globe. Ships of the proper construction and equipment\r\nto be of the greatest efficiency in case of maritime war might be made\r\nconstant and active agents in time of peace in the advancement and\r\nprotection of our foreign trade and in the nurture and discipline of\r\nyoung seamen, who would naturally in some numbers mix with and improve\r\nthe crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad\r\nrecognize the value to foreign commerce of an active movement of our\r\nnaval vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval\r\nofficers in promoting every interest of their countrymen is a just\r\nsubject of national pride.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by\r\nthe report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It\r\nis believed that the present financial situation of the United States,\r\nwhether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing\r\nwealth, or the extent and variety of our resources, is more favorable\r\nthan that of any other country of our time, and has never been\r\nsurpassed by that of any country at any period of its history. All our\r\nindustries are thriving; the rate of interest is low; new railroads\r\nare being constructed; a vast immigration is increasing our\r\npopulation, capital, and labor; new enterprises in great number are\r\nin progress, and our commercial relations with other countries are\r\nimproving.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June\r\n30, 1880, were--\r\n\r\n  From customs.......................................... $186,522,064.60\r\n  From internal revenue.................................. 124,009,373.92\r\n  From sales of public lands............................... 1,016,506.60\r\n  From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks... 7,014,971.44\r\n  From repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies.. 1,707,367.18\r\n  From sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies............ 786,621.22\r\n  From customs fees, fines, penalties, etc................. 1,148,800.16\r\n  From fees--consular, letters patent, and lands........... 2,337,029.00\r\n  From proceeds of sales of Government property.............. 282,616.50\r\n  From profits on coinage, etc............................. 2,792,186.78\r\n  From revenues of the District of Columbia................ 1,809,469.70\r\n  From miscellaneous sources............................... 4,099,603.88\r\n\r\n  Total ordinary receipts................................ 333,526,610.98\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures for the same period were--\r\n\r\n  For civil expenses..................................... $15,693,963.55\r\n  For foreign intercourse.................................. 1,211,490.58\r\n  For Indians.............................................. 5,945,457.09\r\n  For pensions (including $19,341,025.20 arrears of pensions)\r\n  ........................................................ 56,777,174.44\r\n  For the military establishment, including river and harbor\r\n  improvements and arsenals............................... 38,116,916.22\r\n  For the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery,\r\n  and improvements at navy-yards.......................... 13,536,984.74\r\n  For miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings,\r\n  light-houses, and collecting the revenue................ 34,535,691.00\r\n  For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia.. 3,272,384.63\r\n  For interest on the public debt......................... 95,757,575.11\r\n  For premium on bonds purchased........................... 2,795,320.42\r\n\r\n\r\nleaving a surplus revenue of $65,883,653.20, which, with an amount\r\ndrawn from the cash balance in Treasury of $8,084,434.21, making\r\n$73,968,087.41, was applied to the redemption--\r\n\r\n  Of bonds for the sinking fund.......................... $73,652,900.00\r\n  Of fractional currency..................................... 251,717.41\r\n  Of the loan of 1858......................................... 40,000.00\r\n  Of temporary loan.............................................. 100.00\r\n  Of bounty-land scrip............................................ 25.00\r\n  Of compound-interest notes.................................. 16,500.00\r\n  Of 7.30 notes of 1864-65..................................... 2,650.00\r\n  Of one and two year notes.................................... 3,700.00\r\n  Of old demand notes............................................ 495.00\r\n\r\n  Total................................................... 73,968,087.41\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount due the sinking fund for this year was $37,931,643.55.\r\nThere was applied thereto the sum of $73,904,617.41, being\r\n$35,972,973.86 in excess of the actual requirements for the year.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the revenues from all sources during the fiscal\r\nyear ended June 30, 1880, was $333,526,610.98, an increase over the\r\npreceding year of $59,699,426.52. The receipts thus far of the current\r\nyear, together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the\r\nyear, amount to $350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the\r\nestimated expenditures of the year and leave a surplus of $90,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that this large surplus revenue occurs at a period\r\nwhen it may be directly applied to the payment of the public debt soon\r\nto be redeemable. No public duty has been more constantly cherished\r\nin the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as\r\nrapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe debt of the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive\r\nof accruing interest, attained its maximum of $2,756,431,571.43\r\nin August, 1865, and has since that time been reduced to\r\n$1,886,019,504.65. Of the principal of the debt, $108,758,100 has been\r\npaid since March 1, 1877, effecting an annual saving of interest of\r\n$6,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the\r\nsale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest and the application of\r\nthe proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The\r\nannual saving thus secured since March 1, 1877, is $14,290,453.50.\r\nWithin a short period over six hundred millions of 5 and 6 per\r\ncent bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable\r\nopportunity not only to further reduce the principal of the debt, but\r\nalso to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid.\r\nI call the attention of Congress to the views expressed on this\r\nsubject by the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report, and\r\nrecommend prompt legislation to enable the Treasury Department to\r\ncomplete the refunding of the debt which is about to mature.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or\r\nendangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly\r\nto the revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity. The fears\r\nthat preceded and accompanied resumption have proved groundless. No\r\nconsiderable amount of United States notes have been presented for\r\nredemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and\r\nimported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The\r\nincrease of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1,\r\n1879, is estimated at $227,399,428.\r\n\r\nThere are still in existence, uncanceled, $346,681,016 of United\r\nStates legal-tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war\r\nmeasure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which\r\nthe United States was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's\r\nexistence required, in the judgment of Congress, an issue of\r\nlegal-tender paper money. That it served well the purpose for which\r\nit was created is not questioned, but the employment of the notes as\r\npaper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the object for\r\nwhich they were provided, was not contemplated by the framers of the\r\nlaw under which they were issued. These notes long since became, like\r\nany other pecuniary obligation of the Government, a debt to be paid,\r\nand when paid to be canceled as mere evidence of an indebtedness\r\nno longer existing. I therefore repeat what was said in the annual\r\nmessage of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United\r\nStates notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts is\r\na step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency\r\nwhich should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and\r\nthe interest and security of the people.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the\r\ncoinage of silver dollars, fixing their value, and giving them\r\nlegal-tender character it was believed by many of the supporters of\r\nthe measure that the silver dollar which it authorized would speedily\r\nbecome, under the operations of the law, of equivalent value to the\r\ngold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while\r\nthey doubted as to the probability of this result, nevertheless were\r\nwilling to give the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to\r\nstop the coinage if experience should prove that the silver dollar\r\nauthorized by the bill continued to be of less commercial value than\r\nthe standard gold dollar.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of silver dollars under the act referred to began in\r\nMarch, 1878, and has been continued as required by the act. The\r\naverage rate per month to the present time has been $2,276,492. The\r\ntotal amount coined prior to the 1st of November last was $72,847,750.\r\nOf this amount $47,084,450 remain in the Treasury, and only\r\n$25,763,291 are in the hands of the people. A constant effort has been\r\nmade to keep this currency in circulation, and considerable expense\r\nhas been necessarily incurred for this purpose; but its return to the\r\nTreasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation of\r\nthe friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value\r\nof the silver dollar containing 412-1/2 grains of silver has\r\nnot increased. During the year prior to the passage of the bill\r\nauthorizing its coinage the market value of the silver which it\r\ncontained was from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the standard gold\r\ndollar. During the last year the average market value of the silver\r\ndollar has been 88-1/2 cents.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to\r\nsilver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value\r\nof silver as a result of that legislation, has failed to produce the\r\neffect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring,\r\nas it does, the coinage of a nominal dollar which in reality is not\r\na dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be\r\nforced to accept a single metal as the sole legal standard of value in\r\ncirculation, and this a standard of less value than it purports to be\r\nworth in the recognized money of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, sound financial principles,\r\nand our best interests all require that the country should have as its\r\nlegal-tender money both gold and silver coin of an intrinsic value,\r\nas bullion, equivalent to that which upon its face it purports to\r\npossess. The Constitution in express terms recognizes both gold and\r\nsilver as the only true legal-tender money. To banish either of these\r\nmetals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium\r\nof exchange to the disparagement of important interests. The United\r\nStates produces more silver than any other country, and is directly\r\ninterested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which\r\nfurnish the coinage of the world. It will, in my judgment, contribute\r\nto this result if Congress will repeal so much of existing legislation\r\nas requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412-1/2\r\ngrains of silver, and in its stead will authorize the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value, as bullion, with\r\ngold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will be in accordance with\r\nfamiliar precedents. Congress on several occasions has altered the\r\nratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more\r\nnearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nIn financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater\r\nfidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found\r\nby experience to diminish the rates of interest which debtors are\r\nrequired to pay and to increase the facility with which money can\r\nbe obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial\r\nhistory shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidence\r\nin the exact performance of moneyed obligations is established.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the expenditures of the\r\nWar Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, were\r\n$39,924,773.03. The appropriations for this Department for the current\r\nfiscal year amount to $41,993,630.40.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Army, the Secretary invites attention to the fact\r\nthat its strength is limited by statute (U.S. Revised Statutes,\r\nsec. 1115) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, but that provisos\r\ncontained in appropriation bills have limited expenditures to the\r\nenlistment of but 25,000. It is believed the full legal strength is\r\nthe least possible force at which the present organization can be\r\nmaintained, having in view efficiency, discipline, and economy. While\r\nthe enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation\r\nfor pay of the Army, the saving made in other respects would be more\r\nthan an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of\r\nthe Army would be largely increased.\r\n\r\nThe rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver and the great tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new\r\nterritory impose on the military an entire change of policy. The\r\nmaintenance of small posts along wagon and stage routes of travel\r\nis no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected, of a\r\nmore substantial character than those heretofore constructed, will be\r\nrequired. Under existing laws permanent buildings can not be erected\r\nwithout the sanction of Congress, and when sales of military sites\r\nand buildings have been authorized the moneys received have reverted\r\nto the Treasury and could only become available through a new\r\nappropriation. It is recommended that provision be made by a general\r\nstatute for the sale of such abandoned military posts and buildings as\r\nare found to be unnecessary and for the application of the proceeds\r\nto the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts\r\nare of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed\r\ncondition of the country, their occupation is continued at great\r\nexpense and inconvenience, because they afford the only available\r\nshelter for troops.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a large number of officers of the line, in active duty,\r\nfrom their regiments is a serious detriment to the maintenance of\r\nthe service. The constant demand for small detachments, each of which\r\nshould be commanded by a commissioned officer, and the various details\r\nof officers for necessary service away from their commands occasion\r\na scarcity in the number required for company duties. With a view to\r\nlessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law\r\nauthorizing the detail of officers from the active list as professors\r\nof tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities\r\nbe so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the\r\nretired list of the Army.\r\n\r\nAttention is asked to the necessity of providing by legislation for\r\norganizing, arming, and disciplining the _active_ militia of the\r\ncountry, and liberal appropriations are recommended in this behalf.\r\nThe reports of the Adjutant-General of the Army and the Chief of\r\nOrdnance touching this subject fully set forth its importance.\r\n\r\nThe report of the officer in charge of education in the Army shows\r\nthat there are 78 schools now in operation in the Army, with an\r\naggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The Secretary\r\nrecommends the enlistment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank and\r\npay of commissary-sergeants. An appropriation is needed to supply the\r\njudge-advocates of the Army with suitable libraries, and the Secretary\r\nrecommends that the Corps of Judge-Advocates be placed upon the same\r\nfooting as to promotion with the other staff corps of the Army. Under\r\nexisting laws the Bureau of Military Justice consists of one officer\r\n(the Judge-Advocate-General), and the Corps of Judge-Advocates of\r\neight officers of equal rank (majors), with a provision that the\r\nlimit of the corps shall remain at four when reduced by casualty\r\nor resignation to that number. The consolidation of the Bureau of\r\nMilitary Justice and the Corps of Judge-Advocates upon the same\r\nbasis with the other staff corps of the Army would remove an unjust\r\ndiscrimination against deserving officers and subserve the best\r\ninterests of the service.\r\n\r\nEspecial attention is asked to the report of the Chief of Engineers\r\nupon the condition of our national defenses. From a personal\r\ninspection of many of the fortifications referred to, the Secretary\r\nis able to emphasize the recommendations made and to state that their\r\nincomplete and defenseless condition is discreditable to the country.\r\nWhile other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on\r\noffensive warfare and attacking maritime cities, we have been dormant\r\nin preparation for defense. Nothing of importance has been done toward\r\nstrengthening and finishing our casemated works since our late civil\r\nwar, during which the great guns of modern warfare and the heavy armor\r\nof modern fortifications and ships came into use among the nations;\r\nand our earthworks, left by a sudden failure of appropriations some\r\nyears since in all stages of incompletion, are now being rapidly\r\ndestroyed by the elements.\r\n\r\nThe two great rivers of the North American continent, the Mississippi\r\nand the Columbia, have their navigable waters wholly within the limits\r\nof the United States, and are of vast importance to our internal and\r\nforeign commerce. The permanency of the important work on the South\r\nPass of the Mississippi River seems now to be assured. There has been\r\nno failure whatever in the maintenance of the maximum channel during\r\nthe six months ended August 9 last. This experiment has opened a\r\nbroad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement upon the\r\npermanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among\r\npeople abroad and at home, and especially among the communities of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley, whose commercial exchanges float in an\r\nunobstructed channel safely to and from the sea.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive improvement of the Mississippi and its tributaries is\r\na matter of transcendent importance. These great waterways comprise\r\na system of inland transportation spread like network over a large\r\nportion of the United States, and navigable to the extent of many\r\nthousands of miles. Producers and consumers alike have a common\r\ninterest in such unequaled facilities for cheap transportation.\r\nGeographically, commercially, and politically, they are the strongest\r\ntie between the various sections of the country. These channels of\r\ncommunication and interchange are the property of the nation.\r\nIts jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and the plainest\r\nprinciples of public interest require their intelligent and careful\r\nsupervision, with a view to their protection, improvement, and the\r\nenhancement of their usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe channel of the Columbia River for a distance of about 100 miles\r\nfrom its mouth is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasion\r\nserious delays in navigation and heavy expense for lighterage and\r\ntowage. A depth of at least 20 feet at low tide should be secured\r\nand maintained to meet the requirements of the extensive and growing\r\ninland and ocean commerce it subserves. The most urgent need, however,\r\nfor this great waterway is a permanent improvement of the channel at\r\nthe mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nFrom Columbia River to San Francisco, a distance of over 600 miles,\r\nthere is no harbor on our Pacific coast which can be approached\r\nduring stormy weather. An appropriation of $150,000 was made by the\r\nForty-fifth Congress for the commencement of a breakwater and harbor\r\nof refuge, to be located at some point between the Straits of Fuca and\r\nSan Francisco at which the necessities of commerce, local and general,\r\nwill be best accommodated. The amount appropriated is thought to be\r\nquite inadequate for the purpose intended. The cost of the work, when\r\nfinished, will be very great, owing to the want of natural advantages\r\nfor a site at any point on the coast between the designated limits,\r\nand it has not been thought to be advisable to undertake the work\r\nwithout a larger appropriation. I commend the matter to the attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the new building for the War Department is urgently\r\nneeded, and the estimates for continuing its construction are\r\nespecially recommended.\r\n\r\nThe collections of books, specimens, and records constituting the Army\r\nMedical Museum and Library are of national importance. The library\r\nnow contains about 51,500 volumes and 57,000 pamphlets relating to\r\nmedicine, surgery, and allied topics. The contents of the Army Medical\r\nMuseum consist of 22,000 specimens, and are unique in the completeness\r\nwith which both military surgery and the diseases of armies are\r\nillustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable loss, not only\r\nto the United States, but to the world. There are filed in the Record\r\nand Pension Division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records,\r\ntogether with a great quantity of papers, embracing the original\r\nrecords of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside\r\nfrom their historical value, these records are daily searched for\r\nevidence needed in the settlement of large numbers of pension and\r\nother claims, for the protection of the Government against attempted\r\nfrauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable\r\ncollections are now in a building which is peculiarly exposed to the\r\ndanger of destruction by fire. It is therefore earnestly recommended\r\nthat an appropriation be made for a new fireproof building, adequate\r\nfor the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these\r\nvaluable collections. Such a building should be absolutely fireproof;\r\nno expenditure for mere architectural display is required. It is\r\nbelieved that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to\r\nexceed $250,000.\r\n\r\nI commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the\r\nCommander in Chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose\r\nwise, firm, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous\r\nconflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains\r\nmany precedents for the recognition of distinguished military merit,\r\nauthorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent services\r\nto the country. An act of Congress authorizing the appointment of\r\na Captain-General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to\r\ncompensation, retirement, and other details, would, in my judgment,\r\nbe altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the successful and\r\nsatisfactory management of that Department during the last fiscal\r\nyear. The total expenditures for the year were $12,916,639.45, leaving\r\nunexpended at the close of the year $2,141,682.23 of the amount of\r\navailable appropriations. The appropriations for the present fiscal\r\nyear, ending June 30, 1881, are $15,095,061.45, and the total\r\nestimates for the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1882, are\r\n$15,953,751.61. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1, 1880, to\r\nNovember 1, 1880, is $5,041,570.45.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy that provision be made\r\nfor the establishment of some form of civil government for the people\r\nof Alaska is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or\r\nproperty in that Territory except such as is afforded by the officers\r\nof the United States ship _Jamestown_. This vessel was dispatched to\r\nSitka because of the fear that without the immediate presence of the\r\nnational authority there was impending danger of anarchy. The steps\r\ntaken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both white\r\nand Indian inhabitants, and the necessity for this method of restraint\r\ndoes not, in my opinion, now exist. If, however, the _Jamestown_\r\nshould be withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, without the\r\nordinary judicial and administrative authority of organized local\r\ngovernment, serious consequences might ensue.\r\n\r\nThe laws provide only for the collection of revenue, the protection of\r\npublic property, and the transmission of the mails. The problem is to\r\nsupply a local rule for a population so scattered and so peculiar in\r\nits origin and condition. The natives are reported to be teachable and\r\nself-supporting, and if properly instructed doubtless would advance\r\nrapidly in civilization, and a new factor of prosperity would be added\r\nto the national life. I therefore recommend the requisite legislation\r\nupon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy has taken steps toward the establishment\r\nof naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama, to meet the\r\nrequirements of our commercial relations with Central and South\r\nAmerica, which are rapidly growing in importance. Locations eminently\r\nsuitable, both as regards our naval purposes and the uses of commerce,\r\nhave been selected, one on the east side of the Isthmus, at Chiriqui\r\nLagoon, in the Caribbean Sea, and the other on the Pacific coast, at\r\nthe Bay of Golfito. The only safe harbors, sufficiently commodious, on\r\nthe Isthmus are at these points, and the distance between them is less\r\nthan 100 miles. The report of the Secretary of the Navy concludes with\r\nvaluable suggestions with respect to the building up of our merchant\r\nmarine service, which deserve the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General exhibits the continual growth and\r\nthe high state of efficiency of the postal service. The operations\r\nof no Department of the Government, perhaps, represent with greater\r\nexactness the increase in the population and the business of the\r\ncountry. In 1860 the postal receipts were $8,518,067.40; in 1880 the\r\nreceipts were $33,315,479.34. All the inhabitants of the country are\r\ndirectly and personally interested in having proper mail facilities,\r\nand naturally watch the Post-Office very closely. This careful\r\noversight on the part of the people has proved a constant stimulus\r\nto improvement. During the past year there was an increase of 2,134\r\npost-offices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making\r\nan additional annual transportation of 10,804,191 miles. The\r\nrevenues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated\r\nat $38,845,174.10, and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leaving a\r\ndeficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $3,630,757.90.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Postal Union has received the accession of almost all\r\nthe countries and colonies of the world maintaining organized postal\r\nservices, and it is confidently expected that all the other countries\r\nand colonies now outside the union will soon unite therewith, thus\r\nrealizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the union of\r\nforming, for purposes of international mail communication, a single\r\npostal territory, embracing the world, with complete uniformity\r\nof postal charges and conditions of international exchange for all\r\ndescriptions of correspondence. To enable the United States to do its\r\nfull share of this great work, additional legislation is asked by the\r\nPostmaster-General, to whose recommendations especial attention is\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of the Postmaster-General that it would be wise to\r\nencourage, by appropriate legislation, the establishment of American\r\nlines of steamers by our own citizens to carry the mails between our\r\nown ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America, and of\r\ntranspacific countries is commended to the serious consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is also invited to the suggestions of the\r\nPostmaster-General in regard to postal savings.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for additional provision to aid in the transaction of\r\nthe business of the Federal courts becomes each year more apparent.\r\nThe dockets of the Supreme Court and of the circuit courts in the\r\ngreater number of the circuits are encumbered with the constant\r\naccession of cases. In the former court, and in many instances in\r\nthe circuit courts, years intervene before it is practicable to bring\r\ncases to hearing.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General recommends the establishment of an intermediate\r\ncourt of errors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of\r\njudges of the circuit court in each circuit, with the exception of the\r\nsecond circuit, should be increased by the addition of another\r\njudge; in the second circuit, that two should be added; and that an\r\nintermediate appellate court should be formed in each circuit, to\r\nconsist of the circuit judges and the circuit justice, and that in the\r\nevent of the absence of either of these judges the place of the absent\r\njudge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts\r\nin the circuit. Such an appellate court could be safely invested with\r\nlarge jurisdiction, and its decisions would satisfy suitors in many\r\ncases where appeals would still be allowed to the Supreme Court.\r\nThe expense incurred for this intermediate court will require a\r\nvery moderate increase of the appropriations for the expenses of the\r\nDepartment of Justice. This recommendation is commended to the careful\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a delay of justice, in many instances oppressive\r\nand disastrous to suitors, now necessarily occurs in the Federal\r\ncourts, which will in this way be remedied.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents an elaborate\r\naccount of the operations of that Department during the past year. It\r\ngives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to be in\r\na more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made\r\ngratifying progress in agriculture, herding, and mechanical pursuits.\r\nMany who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the Government\r\nare quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their\r\npermanent homes, building houses and engaging in the occupations of\r\ncivilized life. The introduction of the freighting business among them\r\nhas been remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving many of\r\nthem congenial and remunerative employment and in stimulating their\r\nambition to earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity, and\r\nefficiency as carriers are highly praised. The organization of a\r\npolice force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law\r\nand order upon the reservations and in exercising a wholesome moral\r\ninfluence among the Indians themselves. I concur with the Secretary\r\nof the Interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be\r\nincreased, as an inducement to the best class of young men to enter\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMuch care and attention has been devoted to the enlargement of\r\neducational facilities for the Indians. The means available for this\r\nimportant object have been very inadequate. A few additional boarding\r\nschools at Indian agencies have been established and the erection\r\nof buildings has been begun for several more; but an increase of the\r\nappropriations for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed to\r\naccommodate the large number of Indian children of school age. The\r\nnumber offered by their parents from all parts of the country for\r\neducation in the Government schools is much larger than can be\r\naccommodated with the means at present available for that purpose. The\r\nnumber of Indian pupils at the normal school at Hampton, Va., under\r\nthe direction of General Armstrong, has been considerably increased,\r\nand their progress is highly encouraging. The Indian school\r\nestablished by the Interior Department in 1879 at Carlisle, Pa., under\r\nthe direction of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful. It has\r\nnow nearly 200 pupils of both sexes, representing a great variety\r\nof the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. The pupils in both these\r\ninstitutions receive not only an elementary English education, but\r\nare also instructed in housework, agriculture, and useful mechanical\r\npursuits. A similar school was established this year at Forest Grove,\r\nOreg., for the education of Indian youth on the Pacific Coast. In\r\naddition to this, thirty-six Indian boys and girls were selected\r\nfrom the Eastern Cherokees and placed in boarding schools in North\r\nCarolina, where they are to receive an elementary English education\r\nand training in industrial pursuits. The interest shown by Indian\r\nparents, even among the so-called wild tribes, in the education of\r\ntheir children is very gratifying, and gives promise that the results\r\naccomplished by the efforts now making will be of lasting benefit.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the\r\npermanent civilization fund at the disposal of the Department of the\r\nInterior, but the fund is now so much reduced that the continuance\r\nof this beneficial work will in the future depend on specific\r\nappropriations by Congress for the purpose; and I venture to express\r\nthe hope that Congress will not permit institutions so fruitful of\r\ngood results to perish for want of means for their support. On the\r\ncontrary, an increase of the number of such schools appears to me\r\nhighly advisable.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been unusually free from disturbances among the\r\nIndian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes by which they\r\nsurrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration of\r\nan annuity to be paid to them, and agree to settle in severalty\r\non certain lands designated for that purpose, as farmers, holding\r\nindividual title to their land in fee-simple, inalienable for a\r\ncertain period. In this way a costly Indian war has been avoided,\r\nwhich at one time seemed imminent, and for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the country an Indian nation has given up its tribal\r\nexistence to be settled in severalty and to live as individuals under\r\nthe common protection of the laws of the country.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Indians throughout the country during the past\r\nyear, with but few noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and\r\npeaceful. The guerrilla warfare carried on for two years by Victoria\r\nand his band of Southern Apaches has virtually come to an end by the\r\ndeath of that chief and most of his followers on Mexican soil. The\r\ndisturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his\r\nmen, who had taken refuge in the British dominions, are also likely\r\nto cease. A large majority of his followers have surrendered to our\r\nmilitary forces, and the remainder are apparently in progress of\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Interior in expressing the earnest\r\nhope that Congress will at this session take favorable action on\r\nthe bill providing for the allotment of lands on the different\r\nreservations in severalty to the Indians, with patents conferring\r\nfee-simple title inalienable for a certain period, and the eventual\r\ndisposition of the residue of the reservations for general settlement,\r\nwith the consent and for the benefit of the Indians, placing the\r\nlatter under the equal protection of the laws of the country. This\r\nmeasure, together with a vigorous prosecution of our educational\r\nefforts, will work the most important and effective advance toward the\r\nsolution of the Indian problem, in preparing for the gradual merging\r\nof our Indian population in the great body of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nA large increase is reported in the disposal of public lands for\r\nsettlement during the past year, which marks the prosperous growth of\r\nour agricultural industry and a vigorous movement of population toward\r\nour unoccupied lands. As this movement proceeds, the codification\r\nof our land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate the\r\ndisposition of public lands, become of more pressing necessity, and I\r\ntherefore invite the consideration of Congress to the report and the\r\naccompanying draft of a bill made by the Public Lands Commission,\r\nwhich were communicated by me to Congress at the last session. Early\r\naction upon this important subject is highly desirable.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations\r\ncommitted on our public timber lands and the rapid and indiscriminate\r\ndestruction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to\r\nthis end is now generally recognized. In view of the lawless character\r\nof the depredations committed and the disastrous consequences which\r\nwill inevitably follow their continuance, legislation has again and\r\nagain been recommended to arrest the evil and to preserve for the\r\npeople of our Western States and Territories the timber needed for\r\ndomestic and other essential uses.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Director of the Geological Survey is a document\r\nof unusual interest. The consolidation of the various geological and\r\ngeographical surveys and exploring enterprises, each of which has\r\nheretofore operated upon an independent plan, without concert, can\r\nnot fail to be of great benefit to all those industries of the country\r\nwhich depend upon the development of our mineral resources. The labors\r\nof the scientific men, of recognized merit, who compose the corps\r\nof the Geological Survey, during the first season of their field\r\noperations and inquiries, appear to have been very comprehensive,\r\nand will soon be communicated to Congress in a number of volumes.\r\nThe Director of the Survey recommends that the investigations carried\r\non by his bureau, which so far have been confined to the so-called\r\npublic-land States and Territories, be extended over the entire country,\r\nand that the necessary appropriation be made for this purpose. This\r\nwould be particularly beneficial to the iron, coal, and other mining\r\ninterests of the Mississippi Valley and of the Eastern and Southern\r\nStates. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior asks attention to the want of room in\r\nthe public buildings of the capital, now existing and in progress of\r\nconstruction, for the accommodation of the clerical force employed and\r\nof the public records. Necessity has compelled the renting of private\r\nbuildings in different parts of the city for the location of public\r\noffices, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the\r\nseparation of offices belonging to the same Department impedes the\r\ntransaction of current business. The Secretary suggests that the\r\nblocks surrounding Lafayette Square on the east, north, and west be\r\npurchased as the sites for new edifices for the accommodation of the\r\nGovernment offices, leaving the square itself intact, and that if such\r\nbuildings were constructed upon a harmonious plan of architecture\r\nthey would add much to the beauty of the national capital, and would,\r\ntogether with the Treasury and the new State, Navy, and War Department\r\nbuilding, form one of the most imposing groups of public edifices in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Agriculture expresses the confident belief that\r\nhis efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have\r\nbeen encouragingly rewarded. The importance of the results attained\r\nhave attracted marked attention at home and have received the special\r\nconsideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our\r\nown tea and the manufacture of our own sugar would make a difference\r\nof many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner asks attention particularly to the\r\ncontinued prevalence of an infectious and contagious cattle\r\ndisease known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as cattle plague, or\r\npleuro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease in certain sections\r\nof our country is the occasion of great loss to our farmers and of\r\nserious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes\r\na market for most of our live stock and dressed meats. The value of\r\nneat cattle exported from the United States for the eight months ended\r\nAugust 31, 1880, was more than $12,000,000, and nearly double the\r\nvalue for the same period in 1879--an unexampled increase of export\r\ntrade. Your early attention is solicited to this important matter.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Education reports a continued increase of public\r\ninterest in educational affairs, and that the public schools generally\r\nthroughout the country are well sustained. Industrial training\r\nis attracting deserved attention, and colleges for instruction,\r\ntheoretical and practical, in agriculture and mechanic arts, including\r\nthe Government schools recently established for the instruction\r\nof Indian youth, are gaining steadily in public estimation. The\r\nCommissioner asks special attention to the depredations committed on\r\nthe lands reserved for the future support of public instruction, and\r\nto the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the\r\nTerritories and in the Southern States. The recommendation heretofore\r\nmade is repeated and urged, that an educational fund be set apart from\r\nthe net proceeds of the sales of the public lands annually, the\r\nincome of which and the remainder of the net annual proceeds to\r\nbe distributed on some satisfactory plan to the States and the\r\nTerritories and the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe success of the public schools of the District of Columbia, and\r\nthe progress made, under the intelligent direction of the board\r\nof education and the superintendent, in supplying the educational\r\nrequirements of the District with thoroughly trained and efficient\r\nteachers, is very gratifying. The acts of Congress, from time to time,\r\ndonating public lands to the several States and Territories in aid\r\nof educational interests have proved to be wise measures of public\r\npolicy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a\r\nmatter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this legislation,\r\nthe wisdom of which has been so fully vindicated by experience, to the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nI again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia\r\nto the favorable consideration of Congress. The affairs of the\r\nDistrict, as shown by the report of the Commissioners, are in a very\r\nsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nIn my annual messages heretofore and in my special message of December\r\n19, 1879, I have urged upon the attention of Congress the necessity of\r\nreclaiming the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to the capital, and I\r\nam constrained by its importance to advert again to the subject. These\r\nflats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment\r\nto the drainage of the city and seriously impair its health. It is\r\nbelieved that with this substantial improvement of its river front the\r\ncapital would be in all respects one of the most attractive cities\r\nin the world. Aside from its permanent population, this city is\r\nnecessarily the place of residence of persons from every section of\r\nthe country engaged in the public service. Many others reside here\r\ntemporarily for the transaction of business with the Government.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that the land acquired will probably be\r\nworth the cost of reclaiming it and that the navigation of the river\r\nwill be greatly improved. I therefore again invite the attention of\r\nCongress to the importance of prompt provision for this much needed\r\nand too long delayed improvement.\r\n\r\nThe water supply of the city is inadequate. In addition to the\r\nordinary use throughout the city, the consumption by Government is\r\nnecessarily very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the various\r\nDepartments, and a large quantity is required for the proper\r\npreservation of the numerous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I\r\nrecommend that this subject receive the early attention of Congress,\r\nand that in making provision for an increased supply such means be\r\nadopted as will have in view the future growth of the city. Temporary\r\nexpedients for such a purpose can not but be wasteful of money,\r\nand therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding\r\nfacilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgment, be\r\nconstructed. I commend again to the attention of Congress the subject\r\nof the removal from their present location of the depots of the\r\nseveral railroads entering the city; and I renew the recommendations\r\nof my former messages in behalf of the erection of a building for the\r\nCongressional Library, the completion of the Washington Monument, and\r\nof liberal appropriations in support of the benevolent, reformatory,\r\nand penal institutions of the District.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B.

Miles, brigadier-generals in the Army; William Stickney, of\r\nthe District of Columbia, and Walter Allen, of Massachusetts,\r\nand requested them to confer with the Ponca Indians in the Indian\r\nTerritory, and, if in their judgment it was advisable, also with that\r\npart of the tribe which remained in Dakota, and \"to ascertain the\r\nfacts in regard to their removal and present condition so far as was\r\nnecessary to determine the question as to what justice and humanity\r\nrequired should be done by the Government of the United States, and to\r\nreport their conclusions and recommendations in the premises.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission, in pursuance of these instructions, having visited the\r\nPonca Indians at their homes in the Indian Territory and in Dakota\r\nand made a careful investigation of the subject referred to them, have\r\nreported their conclusions and recommendations, and I now submit their\r\nreport, together with the testimony taken, for the consideration of\r\nCongress. A minority report by Mr. Allen is also herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of December, 1880, a delegation of Ponca chiefs from the\r\nIndian Territory presented to the Executive a declaration of their\r\nwishes, in which they stated that it was their desire \"to remain on\r\nthe lands now occupied by the Poncas in the Indian Territory\" and \"to\r\nrelinquish all their right and interest in the lands formerly owned\r\nand occupied by the Ponca tribe in the State of Nebraska and the\r\nTerritory of Dakota;\" and the declaration sets forth the compensation\r\nwhich they will accept for the lands to be surrendered and for the\r\ninjuries done to the tribe by their removal to the Indian Territory.\r\nThis declaration, agreeably to the request of the chiefs making it, is\r\nherewith transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe public attention has frequently been called to the injustice and\r\nwrong which the Ponca tribe of Indians has suffered at the hands of\r\nthe Government of the United States. This subject was first brought\r\nbefore Congress and the country by the Secretary of the Interior in\r\nhis annual report for the year 1877, in which he said:\r\n\r\n  The case of the Poncas seems entitled to especial\r\n  consideration at the hands of Congress. They have always been\r\n  friendly to the whites. It is said, and, as far as I have been\r\n  able to learn, truthfully, that no Ponca ever killed a\r\n  white man. The orders of the Government have always met with\r\n  obedient compliance at their hands. Their removal from their\r\n  old homes on the Missouri River was to them a great hardship.\r\n  They had been born and raised there. They had houses there in\r\n  which they lived according to their ideas of comfort. Many\r\n  of them had engaged in agriculture and possessed cattle and\r\n  agricultural implements. They were very reluctant to leave all\r\n  this, but when Congress had resolved upon their removal they\r\n  finally overcame that reluctance and obeyed. Considering\r\n  their constant good conduct, their obedient spirit, and the\r\n  sacrifices they have made, they are certainly entitled to\r\n  more than ordinary care at the hands of the Government, and I\r\n  urgently recommend that liberal provision be made to aid them\r\n  in their new settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same volume the report of E.A. Howard, the agent of the Poncas,\r\nis published, which contains the following:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I am of the opinion that the removal of the Poncas from the\r\n  northern climate of Dakota to the southern climate of the\r\n  Indian Territory at the season of the year it was done will\r\n  prove a mistake, and that a great mortality will surely follow\r\n  among the people when they shall have been here for a time and\r\n  become poisoned with the malaria of the climate. Already the\r\n  effects of the climate may be seen upon them in the _ennui_\r\n  that seems to have settled upon each and in the large number\r\n  now sick.\r\n\r\n  It is a matter of astonishment to me that the Government\r\n  should have ordered the removal of the Ponca Indians from\r\n  Dakota to the Indian Territory without having first made\r\n  some provision for their settlement and comfort. Before their\r\n  removal was carried into effect an appropriation should have\r\n  been made by Congress sufficient to have located them in their\r\n  new home, by building a comfortable house for the occupancy\r\n  of every family of the tribe. As the case now is, no\r\n  appropriation has been made by Congress, except for a sum but\r\n  little more than sufficient to remove them; no houses have\r\n  been built for their use, and the result is that these people\r\n  have been placed on an uncultivated reservation to live in\r\n  their tents as best they may, and await further legislative\r\n  action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  These Indians claim that the Government had no right to move\r\n  them from their reservation without first obtaining from them\r\n  by purchase or treaty the title which they had acquired\r\n  from the Government, and for which they rendered a valuable\r\n  consideration. They claim that the date of the settlement of\r\n  their tribe upon the land composing their old reservation is\r\n  prehistoric; that they were all born there, and that their\r\n  ancestors from generations back beyond their knowledge were\r\n  born and lived upon its soil, and that they finally acquired\r\n  a complete and perfect title from the Government by a treaty\r\n  made with the \"Great Father\" at Washington, which they claim\r\n  made it as legitimately theirs as is the home of the white man\r\n  acquired by gift or purchase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subject was again referred to in similar terms in the annual\r\nreport of the Interior Department for 1878, in the reports of the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs and of the agent for the Poncas, and in\r\n1879 the Secretary of the Interior said:\r\n\r\n  That the Poncas were grievously wronged by their removal from\r\n  their location on the Missouri River to the Indian Territory,\r\n  their old reservation having, by a mistake in making the Sioux\r\n  treaty, been transferred to the Sioux, has been at length and\r\n  repeatedly set forth in my reports, as well as those of the\r\n  Commissioner of Indian Affairs. All that could be subsequently\r\n  done by this Department in the absence of new legislation to\r\n  repair that wrong and to indemnify them for their losses\r\n  has been done with more than ordinary solicitude. They were\r\n  permitted to select a new location for themselves in the\r\n  Indian Territory, the Quapaw Reserve, to which they had first\r\n  been taken, being objectionable to them. They chose a tract of\r\n  country on the Arkansas River and the Salt Fork northwest of\r\n  the Pawnee Reserve. I visited their new reservation personally\r\n  to satisfy myself of their condition. The lands they now\r\n  occupy are among the very best in the Indian Territory in\r\n  point of fertility, well watered and well timbered, and\r\n  admirably adapted for agriculture as well as stock raising. In\r\n  this respect their new reservation is unquestionably superior\r\n  to that which they left behind them on the Missouri River.\r\n  Seventy houses have been built by and for them, of far better\r\n  quality than the miserable huts they formerly occupied in\r\n  Dakota, and the construction of a larger number is now in\r\n  progress, so that, as the agent reports, every Ponca family\r\n  will be comfortably housed before January. A very liberal\r\n  allowance of agricultural implements and stock cattle has been\r\n  given them, and if they apply themselves to agricultural work\r\n  there is no doubt that their condition will soon be far more\r\n  prosperous than it has ever been before. During the first\r\n  year after their removal to the Indian Territory they lost\r\n  a comparatively large number of their people by death, in\r\n  consequence of the change of climate, which is greatly to\r\n  be deplored; but their sanitary condition is now very much\r\n  improved. The death rate among them during the present year\r\n  has been very low, and the number of cases of sickness\r\n  is constantly decreasing. It is thought that they are now\r\n  sufficiently acclimated to be out of danger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA committee of the Senate, after a very full investigation of the\r\nsubject, on the 31st of May, 1880, reported their conclusions to the\r\nSenate, and both the majority and minority of the committee agreed\r\nthat \"a great wrong had been done to the Ponca Indians.\" The majority\r\nof the committee say:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Nothing can strengthen the Government in a just policy to the\r\n  Indians so much as a demonstration of its willingness to do\r\n  ample and complete justice whenever it can be shown that it\r\n  has inflicted a wrong upon a weak and trusting tribe. It is\r\n  impossible for the United States to hope for any confidence to\r\n  be reposed in them by the Indians until there shall be shown\r\n  on their part a readiness to do justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minority report is equally explicit as to the duty of the\r\nGovernment to repair the wrong done the Poncas. It says:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  We should be more prompt and anxious because they are weak\r\n  and we are strong. In my judgment we should be liberal to the\r\n  verge of lavishness in the expenditure of our money to improve\r\n  their condition, so that they and all others may know that,\r\n  although, like all nations and all men, we may do wrong, we\r\n  are willing to make ample reparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report of the commission appointed by me, of which General\r\nCrook was chairman, and the testimony taken by them and their\r\ninvestigations, add very little to what was already contained in the\r\nofficial reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the report of\r\nthe Senate committee touching the injustice done to the Poncas by\r\ntheir removal to the Indian Territory. Happily, however, the evidence\r\nreported by the commission and their recommendations point out\r\nconclusively the true measures of redress which the Government of the\r\nUnited States ought now to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe commission in their conclusions omit to state the important facts\r\nas to the present condition of the Poncas in the Indian Territory, but\r\nthe evidence they have reported shows clearly and conclusively\r\nthat the Poncas now residing in that Territory, 521 in number, are\r\nsatisfied with their new homes; that they are healthy, comfortable,\r\nand contented, and that they have freely and firmly decided to adhere\r\nto the choice announced in their letter of October 25, 1880, and\r\nin the declaration of December 27, 1880, to remain in the Indian\r\nTerritory and not to return to Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe evidence reported also shows that the fragment of the Ponca\r\ntribe--perhaps 150 in number--which is still in Dakota and Nebraska\r\nprefer to remain on their old reservation.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts I am convinced that the recommendations of the\r\ncommission, together with the declaration of the chiefs of December\r\nlast, if substantially followed, will afford a solution of the Ponca\r\nquestion which is consistent with the wishes and interests of\r\nboth branches of the tribe, with the settled Indian policy of the\r\nGovernment, and, as nearly as is now practicable, with the demands of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nOur general Indian policy for the future should embrace the following\r\nleading ideas:\r\n\r\n1. The Indians should be prepared for citizenship by giving to their\r\nyoung of both sexes that industrial and general education which\r\nis required to enable them to be self-supporting and capable of\r\nself-protection in a civilized community.\r\n\r\n2. Lands should be allotted to the Indians in severalty, inalienable\r\nfor a certain period.\r\n\r\n3. The Indians should have a fair compensation for their lands not\r\nrequired for individual allotments, the amount to be invested, with\r\nsuitable safeguards, for their benefit.\r\n\r\n4. With these prerequisites secured, the Indians should be\r\nmade citizens and invested with the rights and charged with the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended that legislation be adopted in relation to\r\nthe Ponca Indians, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to secure\r\nto the individual members of the Ponca tribe, in severalty, sufficient\r\nland for their support, inalienable for a term of years and until the\r\nrestriction upon alienation may be removed by the President. Ample\r\ntime and opportunity should be given to the members of the tribe\r\nfreely to choose their allotments either on their old or their new\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\nFull compensation should be made for the lands to be relinquished, for\r\ntheir losses by the Sioux depredations and by reason of their removal\r\nto the Indian Territory, the amount not to be less than the sums named\r\nin the declaration of the chiefs made December 27, 1880.\r\n\r\nIn short, nothing should be left undone to show to the Indians that\r\nthe Government of the United States regards their rights as equally\r\nsacred with those of its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the policy should be to place the Indians as\r\nrapidly as practicable on the same footing with the other permanent\r\ninhabitants of our country.\r\n\r\nI do not undertake to apportion the blame for the injustice done to\r\nthe Poncas. Whether the Executive or Congress or the public is chiefly\r\nin fault is not now a question of practical importance. As the Chief\r\nExecutive at the time when the wrong was consummated, I am deeply\r\nsensible that enough of the responsibility for that wrong justly\r\nattaches to me to make it my particular duty and earnest desire to\r\ndo all I can to give to these injured people that measure of redress\r\nwhich is required alike by justice and by humanity.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 2, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for consideration and appropriate action by\r\nCongress, a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, in relation to the\r\nproposed establishment of naval stations of the United States on the\r\nAmerican Isthmus. In this paper the current testimony of prominent\r\nofficers of this Government for a long series of years, as to the\r\nfeasibility and necessity of establishing such stations and the great\r\nadvantage to flow therefrom to the naval and commercial interests\r\nof the United States, is clearly set forth, and the considerations\r\nadduced can not but commend themselves, I am confident, to the careful\r\nattention of Congress. Convinced of the wisdom and propriety of the\r\nsuggestions thus presented, I recommend to Congress the appropriation\r\nof the sum named by the Secretary of the Navy, to be at his disposal\r\nat once, for expenditure as soon as suitable arrangements can be made\r\nto the proposed end.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 4, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a communication from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nwith reference to the dispatch of a vessel for the relief of the\r\n_Jeannette_ polar expedition, and commend the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary to the prompt and favorable action of Congress.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 14, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit the final report addressed to me by the\r\ncommissioners appointed under the act of Congress approved July 19,\r\n1876, authorizing the repavement of that part of Pennsylvania avenue\r\nlying between the Treasury Department and the Capitol Grounds.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 17, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, in response to\r\nthe resolution addressed to him by the House of Representatives of the\r\n31st of January ultimo, on the subject of international action for the\r\nrestoration of silver to full use as money.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of an early international conference, promising valuable\r\nresults in accordance with the interests of this country, is such that\r\nI recommend to the immediate attention of Congress an appropriation\r\nproviding for the proper representation of this Government at such\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of 15th of June, 1880,\r\nrequesting the Secretary of State to report to that body at its next\r\nregular session what changes, if any, of the laws regulating the\r\nmanagement of the Department of State, or of the divisions and the\r\nbureaus thereof, are necessary or would be beneficial in promoting the\r\nefficiency or economy of its administration or management, and also to\r\nmake report concerning the mode of keeping the departmental accounts,\r\nthe checks and safeguards upon expenditures, and the administrative\r\nor clerical changes for the better which may suggest themselves as\r\nexpedient, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State\r\nupon the subjects embraced in that resolution so far as they touch the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nR.B.

I also transmit certain correspondence touching the\r\nnegotiation of said convention.\r\n\r\nR.B.

HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 3, 1881_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving considered the bill entitled \"An act to facilitate the\r\nrefunding of the national debt,\" I am constrained to return it to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, in which it originated, with the following\r\nstatement of my objections to its passage:\r\n\r\nThe imperative necessity for prompt action and the pressure of public\r\nduties in this closing week of my term of office compel me to refrain\r\nfrom any attempt to make a full and satisfactory presentation of the\r\nobjections to the bill.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the passage at the present session of Congress of a\r\nsuitable measure for the refunding of the national debt which is\r\nabout to mature is generally recognized. It has been urged upon the\r\nattention of Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and in my last\r\nannual message. If successfully accomplished, it will secure a large\r\ndecrease in the annual interest payment of the nation, and I earnestly\r\nrecommend, if the bill before me shall fail, that another measure for\r\nthis purpose be adopted before the present Congress adjourns.\r\n\r\nWhile, in my opinion, it would be unwise to authorize the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in his discretion, to offer to the public bonds bearing\r\n3-1/2 per cent interest in aid of refunding, I should not deem it my\r\nduty to interpose my constitutional objection to the passage of the\r\npresent bill if it did not contain, in its fifth section, provisions\r\nwhich, in my judgment, seriously impair the value and tend to the\r\ndestruction of the present national banking system of the country.\r\nThis system has now been in operation almost twenty years. No safer or\r\nmore beneficial banking system was ever established. Its advantages\r\nas a business are free to all who have the necessary capital. It\r\nfurnishes a currency to the public which for convenience and security\r\nof the bill holder has probably never been equaled by that of any\r\nother banking system. Its notes are secured by the deposit with the\r\nGovernment of the interest-bearing bonds of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe section of the bill before me which relates to the national\r\nbanking system, and to which objection is made, is not an essential\r\npart of a refunding measure. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5. From and after the 1st day of July, 1881, the 3 per\r\n  cent bonds authorized by the first section of this act shall\r\n  be the only bonds receivable as security for national-bank\r\n  circulation or as security for the safe-keeping and prompt\r\n  payment of the public money deposited with such banks; but\r\n  when any such bonds deposited for the purposes aforesaid shall\r\n  be designated for purchase or redemption by the Secretary\r\n  of the Treasury, the banking association depositing the same\r\n  shall have the right to substitute other issues of the bonds\r\n  of the United States in lieu thereof: _Provided_, That no bond\r\n  upon which interest has ceased shall be accepted or shall be\r\n  continued on deposit as security for circulation or for\r\n  the safe-keeping of the public money; and in case bonds so\r\n  deposited shall not be withdrawn, as provided by law, within\r\n  thirty days after the interest has ceased thereon, the banking\r\n  association depositing the same shall be subject to the\r\n  liabilities and proceedings on the part of the Comptroller\r\n  provided for in section 5234 of the Revised Statutes of the\r\n  United States: _And provided further_, That section 4 of the\r\n  act of June 20, 1874, entitled \"An act fixing the amount of\r\n  United States notes, providing for a redistribution of the\r\n  national-bank currency, and for other purposes,\" be, and the\r\n  same is hereby, repealed, and sections 5159 and 5160 of the\r\n  Revised Statutes of the United States be, and the same are\r\n  hereby, reenacted.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this section it is obvious that no additional banks will\r\nhereafter be organized, except possibly in a few cities or localities\r\nwhere the prevailing rates of interest in ordinary business are\r\nextremely low. No new banks can be organized and no increase of the\r\ncapital of existing banks can be obtained except by the purchase and\r\ndeposit of 3 per cent bonds. No other bonds of the United States can\r\nbe used for the purpose. The one thousand millions of other bonds\r\nrecently issued by the United States, and bearing a higher rate of\r\ninterest than 3 per cent, and therefore a better security for the bill\r\nholder, can not after the 1st of July next be received as security\r\nfor bank circulation. This is a radical change in the banking law. It\r\ntakes from the banks the right they have heretofore had under the law\r\nto purchase and deposit as security for their circulation any of the\r\nbonds issued by the United States, and deprives the bill holder of the\r\nbest security which the banks are able to give by requiring them\r\nto deposit bonds having the least value of any bonds issued by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe average rate of taxation of capital employed in banking is more\r\nthan double the rate of taxation upon capital employed in other\r\nlegitimate business. Under these circumstances, to amend the banking\r\nlaw so as to deprive the banks of the privilege of securing their\r\nnotes by the most valuable bonds issued by the Government will, it is\r\nbelieved, in a large part of the country, be a practical prohibition\r\nof the organization of new banks and prevent the existing banks from\r\nenlarging their capital. The national banking system, if continued at\r\nall, will be a monopoly in the hands of those already engaged in it,\r\nwho may purchase the Government bonds bearing a more favorable rate of\r\ninterest than the 3 per cent bonds prior to next July.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the further organization of banks is to put in jeopardy the\r\nwhole system, by taking from it that feature which makes it, as it\r\nnow is, a banking system free upon the same terms to all who wish\r\nto engage in it. Even the existing banks will be in danger of being\r\ndriven from business by the additional disadvantages to which they\r\nwill be subjected by this bill. In short, I can not but regard\r\nthe fifth section of the bill as a step in the direction of the\r\ndestruction of the national banking system.\r\n\r\nOur country, after a long period of business depression, has just\r\nentered upon a career of unexampled prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the currency from circulation of the national\r\nbanks, and the enforced winding up of the banks in consequence, would\r\ninevitably bring serious embarrassment and disaster to the business\r\nof the country. Banks of issue are essential instruments of modern\r\ncommerce. If the present efficient and admirable system of banking is\r\nbroken down, it will inevitably be followed by a recurrence to other\r\nand inferior methods of banking. Any measure looking to such a result\r\nwill be a disturbing element in our financial system. It will destroy\r\nconfidence and surely check the growing prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nBelieving that a measure for refunding the national debt is not\r\nnecessarily connected with the national banking law, and that any\r\nrefunding act would defeat its own object if it imperiled the national\r\nbanking system or seriously impaired its usefulness, and convinced\r\nthat section 5 of the bill before me would, if it should become a\r\nlaw, work great harm, I herewith return the bill to the House of\r\nRepresentatives for that further consideration which is provided for\r\nin the Constitution.\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the\r\nSenate should be convened at 12 o'clock on the 4th of March next to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the\r\npart of the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United\r\nStates, have considered it to be my duty to issue this my\r\nproclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the\r\nSenate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business\r\nat the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 4th day of March\r\nnext, at 12 o'clock at noon on that day, of which all who shall\r\nat that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby\r\nrequired to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 28th day of February, A.D. 1881, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States of America the one hundred and fifth.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WM. M. EVARTS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 22, 1881_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nIn view of the well-known fact that the sale of intoxicating liquors\r\nin the Army of the United States is the cause of much demoralization\r\namong both officers and men, and that it gives rise to a large\r\nproportion of the cases before general and garrison courts-martial,\r\ninvolving great expense and serious injury to the service--\r\n\r\n_It is therefore directed_, That the Secretary of War take suitable\r\nsteps, as far as practicable consistently with vested rights, to\r\nprevent the sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage at the camps,\r\nforts, and other posts of the Army.\r\n\r\nR.B. HAYES.",
