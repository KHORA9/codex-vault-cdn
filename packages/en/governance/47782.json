Place--Manila and Vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST A WORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a story founded on truth. Practically every incident told\r\nabout really happened; yet some liberty has been taken with the\r\narrangements of these incidents into a story. Events are sometimes\r\ngrouped outside of their natural order and place of occurrence,\r\nand the time of action is shortened. Conversation is necessarily\r\ninvented, and is used to bring out the setting of the story and give\r\nit life. Another thing: Every writer recognizes that it is desirable\r\nto not have too many characters in a story, and to not drag it through\r\nunimportant incidents. Therefore, I have omitted many incidents of\r\nthe occupation of the Philippines, and have in places ascribed to one\r\nperson, in an effort to keep down the number of characters, acts which\r\nproperly belonged to other persons, so that some of the characters\r\nare representative and composite. To illustrate my meaning--that a\r\nlove story in the simplest form might run through the tale I have\r\nmade Saguanaldo appear as a lover as well as a general, though this\r\nis acknowledged to be fiction. In other places I have one character\r\ndoing a work that was really done by a different person; but it\r\nwould have been difficult and confusing to use all the actors in the\r\nstirring drama or to refer to all the many incidents. This shortening\r\nof the period of action, and this combining in one person the deeds of\r\nseveral, is something which Shakespeare did in his historical dramas;\r\nso that this is historical in the same sense that some of his plays\r\nare historical--not as to the truth of every word and the time and\r\nplace of every act, but in spirit and in incident. The truth is there,\r\nbut the grouping is made to meet the author's need.\r\n\r\nThere is no personal bias in this work. It is nothing to the author\r\nthat in this case the center of the plot hinges about churchmen. It\r\nis no more than if it should center around secular affairs. It is the\r\nold story of personal ambition which has appeared in a thousand forms\r\nand has influenced all conditions of people. It is not a matter of\r\nreligion or irreligion, but a picture of what ambition will do for\r\neven the best of aims and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                C. L. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIAR'S DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\"AND THE SUN COMES UP LIKE THUNDER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUp till midnight Manila was at play. In mediæval Luzon they had not\r\nthen lost the sportive instinct of the healthy animal or been lost\r\nin the chase of the dollar. The shops were closed, but the places of\r\namusement were open. The Lunita, outside the city wall, was thronged\r\nwith carriages, and at each end of the Plaza de Gotta a band was\r\nplaying. Spanish grandees and beautiful donnas were driving or\r\npromenading there. Inside the wall churches and theatres were open,\r\nthe churches being first visited and then the play houses. In the\r\namphitheater, built up of bamboo, a crowd of the poorer people were\r\ngathered, and while the braver battles were not in progress at this\r\ntime, cock fighting was attracting the attention of many. Under the\r\nwalls of the old city, the city that best represented the ancient\r\norder, the city of this story, in cloisters arched over where stock\r\nwas being housed, groups of men were throwing dice or playing cards. It\r\nwas like a picture of the middle ages projected into the closing days\r\nof April, 1898.\r\n\r\nWhat an anomaly it was! Walls of the middle ages, surrounded by a\r\ngreat moat, and within a cosmopolitan group, including Spaniards,\r\nChinese and natives of the Northern islands; yet adjoining it to\r\nthe east lay a modern city; and Cavite, eight miles to the west,\r\nwas a fort manned by modern guns. Yellow clay houses of one and two\r\nstories roofed with red tile, some with courts in the center, here\r\nin old Manila, and to the east modern places of business and houses\r\nwell plumbed, lighted with electricity. Churches and cathedrals,\r\nconventos and nunneries everywhere here, and beyond the Passig river\r\nmodern amusement places and Protestant churches.\r\n\r\nIn the magnificent harbor that lay north of Manila, small crafts\r\nof many kinds were grouped at the piers, and in the distance the\r\nmodern fleet of Spain lay at anchor. It was the one portion of the\r\nold order that yet remained; and the world was pressing upon it,\r\nand change was near.\r\n\r\nAmbrosia Lonzello, the Friar's Daughter, stood at the gate in front\r\nof her mother's home, gazing down the street, dreaming the dreams of\r\noriental maidenhood. She had inherited the symmetry of proportion that\r\nbelonged to her mother's tribe in Cebu, and from her father, Bishop\r\nLonzello, had the Spaniard's dark eyes and charming vivacity. It had\r\nbeen twenty years since Friar Lonzello, a young priest then located\r\nin Cebu, had met the young native woman who became Ambrosia's mother;\r\nand though it was forbidden priests to marry, Lonzello yet supported\r\nthe woman he had then loved and the daughter that had been born to\r\nthem. If it was a strange thing to a European, it was rather the\r\nrule than the exception in that oriental, mediaeval country, and as\r\nthe daughter of the Bishop, Ambrosia was one of the prominent young\r\nwomen of the walled city. She stood, gazing down the street and up\r\nat the stars, dreaming her own dreams, a girl without experience in\r\nthe ways of the world, when she heard a voice at her side:\r\n\r\n\"Ambrosia! Buenos dias!\" [1]\r\n\r\nAmbrosia started. She knew the voice. But she supposed the possessor,\r\nCamillo Saguanaldo, was across the bay in China. A few months before\r\nhe had been banished because of leading an insurrection against the\r\nfriars, who were practically the rulers of the Philippines, and his\r\nreturn involved great danger for him. So Ambrosia said:\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were in China, Camillo. Do you not know it is dangerous\r\nfor you to be in Luzon?\"\r\n\r\n\"My duty calls me here, Ambrosia, and here I must be,\" replied the\r\nyouth. \"It is not so dangerous now as it has been in the past. At\r\nlast our prayers are to be answered and America, the great land that\r\nloves liberty, is to give us a chance to secure our freedom. If we do\r\nour part we shall be free. When I was in China I talked with Admiral\r\nRainey, of the American fleet that was anchored there, and he told\r\nme that the United States was about to go to war with Spain solely\r\nto secure liberty for the Cubans; and when I told him how it was in\r\nthe Philippines, that we had been struggling for liberty for three\r\nhundred years, he said that it might be that Uncle Sam would do for\r\nus what he meant to do for the reconcentrados of Cuba. So I came over\r\nin advance to help when the only chance the Filipinos ever had shall\r\ncome to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it might be, Camillo,\" replied the girl. \"But if my father\r\nhears you have returned, he will kill you, and nothing can appease\r\nhis wrath now.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be mentioned that when the insurrection led by Saguanaldo\r\nhad failed and his banishment was decreed, Bishop Lonzello, at the\r\nintercession of Ambrosia, had procured for him an allowance of $20,000\r\non which to live in China. Ambrosia had intended it as a kindness\r\nto him, and the bishop regarded it as a bribe, but now that he had\r\nreturned there was no doubt that Lonzello would prosecute him and if\r\npossible secure his death.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be safe.\" replied the youth. \"I used that $20,000 in buying\r\nguns and ammunition, and have already a stronger force than I ever\r\nhad. My troops are near at hand even now, and Manila is not so peaceful\r\nas she seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know. The heavy guns of the battleships have been mounted\r\nat Corregidor and Caney, and the 160,000 Spanish troops in the city\r\nlaugh at the idea of America ever being able to take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet America will take it. The American fleet will be here and\r\nwill win, and then they will give us freedom. Within a few months\r\nthe Filipinos will be free, and then Ambrosia Lonzello will become\r\nAmbrosia de Saguanaldo.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl flushed with combined embarrassment and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"It can not be,\" she said. \"I am not worthy of you. I shall seek with\r\nyou the freedom of the Filipinos and then I shall die and leave you\r\nfree to marry a woman who has a name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fie, Ambrosia. I will give you my name, and there will be none in\r\nLuzon more honored than that. Many have tried for the good that now\r\nwe shall attain. It must come. The very fact that we have waited for\r\nit so long proves that it must be near. Luz de mi vida [2], it is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" the girl began wistfully, then stopped abruptly. \"Father\r\nis so bitter against you. I always wish you with me, yet you never\r\ncome but I am anxious you should go, lest staying mean your death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, Ambrosia,\" said the youth. \"They call me the Fox of Luzon,\r\nand I find my way where they do not suspect. I was with your father\r\nyesterday and he never knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take no risk,\" plead the girl, throwing herself in his arms. \"Te\r\namo con todo el corazon. [3] You must, you must be careful. Oh, it\r\nis sad, so sad. If they would only let us have a chance the people\r\nmight be so happy. Luzon is a beautiful island. It seems to me like\r\nParadise, the garden of the Lord; and yet for us it is purgatory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some day we shall be released from purgatory, chuleta [4]. The\r\nprayers of our forefathers will prevail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Camillo, come inside, or they will see you.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew the young man into the shadows, and into the house. There\r\nthe lovers talked undisturbed. They talked of things that to them\r\nwere the most momentous--their own loves and their individual plans,\r\nthe hope and future of the island which had been their home all their\r\nlives. Little did they know that time was working for them and through\r\nthem more momentous changes that should affect continents and end\r\ncompletely the feudal in the capitalistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Manila was awakened by the roar of\r\nartillery. It was still dark save for the star light, yet quickly the\r\nstreets were in turmoil. Some grasped the things they most valued and\r\nrushed to most ridiculous places for safety. One man took to the woods\r\nwith a fighting cock under his arm. A few of the bravest mounted to\r\nthe roofs of the dwellings and the towers of the churches in order to\r\nview the fight that had been anticipated, but which had come sooner\r\nthan expected. From these vantage points they looked on a scene such\r\nas falls to the lot of man to observe only once in a thousand lives.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the challenge of Cavite the American fleet was forming in\r\nbattle array. In single file, as if in gala parade, they came, like\r\nactors entering from the wings of a great stage or circus performers\r\nfrom the dressing room, crawling over the white bay like living\r\nthings. The dawn had come, suddenly as in the tropics, come with the\r\nroar of artillery. For once it had literally realized Kipling's line--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the bay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the fleet, the tool of the new order of capitalism, was\r\nready. The command had gone forth from Admiral Rainey: \"You may\r\nfire when you are ready.\" The American flag ship shot a line of\r\nfire, and from the smoke that arose a great roar resounded. Boom,\r\nboom! Fire and shell and smoke and action swept from consciousness\r\nthe peace of nature and thought of the world of life. Now and then\r\nthe white veil of smoke would lift, and the watcher on the towers\r\ncould see in those intervals splintered masts and laboring vessels,\r\nspecks that were men struggling in the waves, and wrecks that lined\r\nthe shore. It did not seem possible that all those specks were men,\r\nwith hopes and plans and families, and hearts and bodies that suffered;\r\nthe watchers on the towers could not know that decks of vessels were\r\nslippery from blood, and that nerves were racked with pain and hearts\r\nwere sore from loss. The American vessels, crawling like water mites\r\nover the white mirror spread below them, circled together about first\r\none and then another of the Spanish ships; and ever as they moved\r\nflashes like fiery legs stretched from their sides. This red venom of\r\ndeath touched the Spanish ships that appeared to wither and consume\r\nbefore it. Here a Spanish ship ran to shore, as though a living,\r\nwounded thing, seeking a place to die, and, trembling, sank beneath\r\nthe waves. There a vessel lay under the pitiless pelting of fire,\r\ntill there was a heavy explosion, and the ship was torn to shreds\r\nthat sprinkled the water, while dots that represented men struggled\r\nin the waves. Yonder a vessel was on fire, and as it bore to shore\r\nspecks that were men dived into the water to save themselves, and\r\nthe red flames licked life from the redder decks.\r\n\r\nWith what precision the stranger ships came on, circling, and\r\npouring death into the helpless vessels whose wooden hulks graft\r\nhad left exposed to shell! How aimlessly and helplessly the Spanish\r\nvessels floundered, unable to fight, and finding no escape! It was\r\nwar, glorious and terrible. In Spain a thousand widows and orphans\r\nwould weep and miss forever that which had been taken from them in a\r\nquarrel in which the fighters had no interest. In America a million\r\nwould scream for joy and tingle with the glory of slaughter and the\r\nthought of being splendid fighters. Within half an hour nearly four\r\nhundred able-bodied men perished and twenty million dollars' worth of\r\nproperty that should have been used to make life happier and better\r\nwas destroyed. It was a great drama, in a splendid amphitheatre,\r\nwith the lifting curtains of night to show it forth, enacted for the\r\nfew in the towers. Ambrosia had seen and understood and was silenced\r\nby the grandeur and horror of it. She felt for the dying, and could\r\nhardly restrain herself from crying out in agony when the American\r\nfleet ceased firing and calmly moved away to prepare, within sight of\r\nthe wrecks and the sacrifice, breakfast for the living, after their\r\nhour's toil.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God, but this is horrible,\" she muttered, faint with her\r\nfeelings. As she spoke, once again she was startled with a voice at\r\nher side. She turned to behold an old man with a long beard, but she\r\nknew the voice, the voice of Saguanaldo, and it said:\r\n\r\n\"Ambrosia, chuleta, it is the dawn, not only of a new day, but also\r\nof a new era.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nLIBERTY'S CENTURY-OLD LOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A beautiful city, Admiral Rainey--from a distance. Strongly\r\nfortified--for the fifteenth century. But you can sweep away the\r\nfortifications as easily as you sank the Spanish war vessels. What\r\nis a walled city with a moat to guns that will carry for miles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt, General Saguanaldo,\" returned the American admiral as\r\nhe sat on deck of his flag ship in the harbor of Manila, faultlessly\r\ngarbed as though for a party, talking to the Filipino insurgent\r\nafter the battle that had spread his name around the globe, \"I do\r\nnot doubt my ability to reduce the Spanish works, but I was looking\r\nto the future. Should I destroy so much private property as would be\r\ninvolved in bombarding Manila I would make enemies of the owners,\r\nwho would give us trouble in days to come. I dare not take such a\r\nserious step until I am instructed from America.\"\r\n\r\n\"But consider, admiral,\" plead the insurgent, \"Manila sits there,\r\nfair to see, but she has drawn the very life from the people of the\r\ninterior for centuries. The private property of which you speak was\r\ngotten from labor by the sorrow of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are doubtless right, general, and I would not blame you if\r\nyou should seek revenge from them, for your people have suffered\r\ngreatly. But with me it is a different proposition. I am not acting\r\nfor myself alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor am I. It may be you do not know the sorrows of Luzon, Señor\r\nAdmiral!\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be I do not, General Saguanaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I tell you of them, Admiral Rainey?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be pleased to know more of this land that I have just come to\r\ncommand until my country tells me what to do, or ends the unhappy war.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Spaniards from Mexico first landed in Maynila, centuries ago,\"\r\ncontinued General Saguanaldo, \"the simple-minded natives bowed to the\r\nwhite people as to gods; and they have been on their knees rendering\r\ntribute of Luzon's products ever since. It did not take the natives\r\nlong to learn the nature of the Spaniards, who were inflamed by the\r\nlust of gold, both by their experience with the Incas and Aztecs in\r\nAmerica and by the hard terms of the Spanish rulers, for we have had\r\nto pay tribute to Rome, to Spain and to Mexico--all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am told the people of the interior are primitive--half naked\r\nIgorrotes, or Negritos, wearing only breech clouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those live chiefly in the Southern islands. The body of the people\r\nof the Northern islands are of the Malayan stock, loving liberty,\r\nbut kept poor by tributes exacted. They were a people of simple ways\r\nand homely virtues. Because of being of Malayan descent they wore\r\ncalled Moros by the Spaniards. The two tribes of Moros, the Tagals of\r\nNorthern Luzon, and the Viscayans of Southern Luzon and North Mindoro,\r\nyielded to Legaspi, to whom the king of Spain gave all the land he\r\nmight conquer. He was not a hard master, leaving the olden, native\r\nchiefs in charge; but when, after this, the friars came from Spain,\r\nthey began the work of oppression. When the great earthquake destroyed\r\nMaynila in 1645, and over 600 perished in the catastrophe, the natives\r\nwere forced to work without pay on the arsenal at Ca Vite, and when,\r\nbecause of harsh treatment, they rebelled, burning towns and churches,\r\nthe friars dispatched soldiers for the head of Sumoroy, the rebel. His\r\nfollowers sent in the head of a pig instead. The enraged friars and\r\nsoldiers tortured to death the mother of Sumoroy, and afterward,\r\nwhen the rebel was betrayed to them, struck off his head and mounted\r\nit on a pole for the people to look upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brutal, doubtless. But such things were common in those days,\"\r\nreturned the admiral.\r\n\r\n\"God pity us, they are too common in Manila in these days. The\r\nreputation of the friars was such in those days that when some of them\r\nwent to Japan it was reported in that land that they were advance\r\nguards of the Spanish army, getting a foothold, and that after them\r\nwould come the army to protect them. The Mikado ordered the friars\r\nout, but they defied him. Then the Japanese emperor adopted heroic\r\nmeasures. He gathered together 150 lepers and sent them to Maynila,\r\nsaying that Japan did not allow Roman friars in that country, but,\r\nsince these friars were fond of this kind of people, he sent them a\r\nship load.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, too, seems to have been inhuman. How were the lepers received?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the friars built the hospital of St. Lazarus for their\r\nreception. You can see it beyond those palms.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was rather a Christian act.\"\r\n\r\n\"The friars have done some good. But they insist on foreign friars\r\nruling instead of native priests, and to maintain their supremacy\r\nkeep the people uneducated. Then they claim ownership of large tracts\r\nof the best land, and exact high rentals. The people have rebelled\r\nagainst their exactions over and over again. Long ago the king of\r\nTagals killed the alcade of Tayabas province, and made the people\r\nbelieve that the earth would swallow the Spaniards when they were\r\nattacked, but his rebellion was put down with great slaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder, General. This confirms my information that the inhabitants\r\nare not free from superstition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eso fue en los dias antiguos [5], Admiral. The people were crude\r\nthen. Perhaps they were like your American Indians. But they were\r\noppressed, and they began even then the rebellion against Spain and the\r\nfriars which they have maintained for over 300 years, from the days\r\nwhen Soliman, the native king, set fire to Maynila and fought them\r\nfrom the forests, to the last rebellion of Rizal and the religious\r\ndeflection of Aglipay.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me a man of ability, like you, General, ought to be able\r\nto win.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will win. But we have hoped so that the great North American\r\nnation that pitied Cuba and that is fighting for her independence will\r\nso pity us and give us independence. I assure you, Admiral, we have\r\nendured longer and more than Cuba has done. The oppression had been\r\nadmitted by our masters. The Augustinians and Jesuits accused each\r\nother of cruelty and the Jesuits were banished. It was not till 1859\r\nthat they were permitted to return. I told you about the destruction\r\nof Manila by earthquake in the olden days. That was not the last or\r\nworst seismic disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had heard as much.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1863 the city was again destroyed by earthquake, which killed\r\nthousands of people and left much destitution. The grafting that\r\nfollowed was scandalous and caused much dissatisfaction. It was in\r\n1872 that the great insurrection occurred. But for an error in signals\r\nwhich started the trouble before the people were ready to support it,\r\nit would have succeeded. As it was, many were executed and shot. At\r\nanother time the people were promised amnesty if they would lay down\r\ntheir arms, but when they did so thousands were massacred. Then came\r\na period of organizing secret societies to work against the friars,\r\nwho were also rulers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these are only incidents that come in the history of every land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Por Dios, Donde se hallaria otro pais que has sufrido tanto. [6]\r\nThink of it! Up to 1811 the Philippine islands dared not trade with\r\nany country but Mexico, not excepting their neighbor, China. Then\r\nthe picturesque, half-moon-shaped galleons of Mexico did all the\r\ncarrying of the Philippines and charged prices such as would enrich\r\nthem in spite of the pirates they frequently met. For this trade\r\nMexican promoters and the Spanish crown received their tribute, and\r\nthe Spanish friars, too, had their share. The people were abjectly\r\npoor. Even the soldiers were often unpaid, and begged their support\r\nfrom the people whom they subjected. The friars charged exorbitant\r\nrentals on the lands they claimed. They encouraged the people to\r\nbuild cathedrals, monasteries and churches, but the cathedrals,\r\nmonasteries and churches did not belong to the people after they had\r\nbuilt them. They charged the people rental on graves in consecrated\r\nground, and when the rent was not paid they evicted the dead. They made\r\nthe price of marriage so high that many of the people lived together\r\nout of wedlock. The friars selected the women of the people they\r\nfancied and openly consorted with them, and the children of friars\r\nare common throughout the islands. The people are poor, living for\r\nthe most part in grass houses, while the friars are rich and live in\r\nluxury; and this has been going on for centuries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad, very bad; the morals of the tropics and the Orient.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not all. The friars exercised the power of secret\r\ninvestigation, and one never knew when he was safe. A friar might\r\nreport a man as a conspirator against Spain, and, while meeting\r\nhim and showing friendship for him in public, secretly secure his\r\nbanishment. There have been cases which I could name, where friars,\r\ncoveting the wife or sister of a man, have procured his banishment\r\nor even secured for him an appointment at a distance, so that they\r\nmight have the way open to accomplish their purposes. There was a fear\r\nwhich beset every man, even those who through fear were nearest to\r\nthe friars, that if his eyes should light upon his wife or daughter\r\nin an envious way, if he did not give them up he was lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, General, this is exaggerated.\"\r\n\r\n\"The half has not been told. In Lenten time, which was the period\r\nwhen the country folk came to confess, the parish friar would give\r\nstrict orders to the scribes of the church that in the distribution\r\nor giving out of the certificates to the penitents among himself\r\nand his coadjutors they should give him the young unmarried women\r\nand servant penitents, whom he obscenely solicited through words and\r\nmanipulations in the confessional.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this is horrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed. Some reverend friars arrogated to themselves rights\r\nwhich in feudal times were called rights of pernada, or the right\r\nto enter the bed of a new bride before the husband. The parish friar\r\nconverted himself up to a certain point into an absolute lord, master\r\nof lives and property, and, if he so willed, made and unmade everything\r\naccording to his fancy. Master of the will of the people more through\r\nfear than out of love for him, he nominated town authorities that\r\npleased him, which nomination elevated almost always the greatest\r\nflatterer of all his parishioners, and it is plain that all weighty\r\ndeterminations dictated by the municipal authorities were not proper\r\ninitiatives, but those of his amours.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not seem possible. Why, that is worse than Cuba.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imagine paying rental on a grave for the bones of a dear one, until\r\nyour money was exhausted, and then seeing the remains dumped into\r\na pile of bones along with scores of other victims. Imagine being\r\nrequired to produce a certain crop each year to be turned over to the\r\nfriars, and if you failed, becoming indebted to them so that there was\r\nno hope of your ever paying out. Imagine being compelled to sell your\r\nrice to the friar at the price he might offer, and being forbidden\r\nto take it to an open market where the price was higher. Would you\r\nrebel against such conditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"The American would not tolerate it even for a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not all. They were cruel, not only in the treatment of their\r\nservants by beating them, but they also took great delight in being eye\r\nwitnesses to tortures and beatings of men and in prisons and jails by\r\nthe civil authorities. They were always, when witnessing these acts,\r\naccompanied by some of the higher Spanish civil authorities, and\r\nthese acts were usually carried out at the instigation of the friars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know of all these things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would to God that you knew, Admiral. Listen! In 1781 the growing of\r\ntobacco on Luzon was made a government monopoly. If farmers refused to\r\nplant a certain amount of tobacco the land was taken from them. Law\r\nrequired the natives to 'tend the tobacco that when raised belonged\r\nto the government; that is, to the friars. If the crop was less than\r\nthe amount estimated for each farmer, he was heavily fined and became\r\nresponsible for that much more the year following. If the crop was\r\nabove the estimate, the government seized it all and destroyed what\r\nit could not sell to advantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you have suffered much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cuba does not know suffering, Admiral. Yet you liberty-loving\r\nAmericans are warring to give Cuba her freedom. Give us freedom,\r\ntoo. Promise me, Admiral.\"\r\n\r\nThe insurgent general, with the impetuosity of the tropics, fell on\r\nhis knees before Admiral Rainey and seized his hands.\r\n\r\n\"America will see you have your rights. Arise,\" the admiral said,\r\nflipping a speck from his coat as he spoke. The insurgent leader\r\nreverently kissed the hand of the admiral, and, crying, \"You will\r\nbe hailed as the great emancipator,\" signaled to his attendants, and\r\nprepared to leave the flagship. Under Rainey's guns the company made\r\nits way to shore, not far from the old moat outside the city's walls,\r\nnow overgrown with grasses and vegetation, which served for draining\r\nthe outlying country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWON BY A WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs General Saguanaldo and his men drew to shore, a small English\r\nwoman approached him from a clump of bamboos that grew near the shore,\r\nhiding the new city from sight.\r\n\r\n\"What do you here, Madam Rizal?\" asked Saguanaldo, bowing low. \"You\r\nalways bear important news.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a circular which Bishop Lonzello has been distributing\r\nthroughout Luzon. Did you win a promise from the admiral to aid us\r\nin our struggle?\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me to go ahead and do the best I could against the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no promise definitely to help us gain our independence?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-o, I can't say that he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grant me permission, then, to lay this document before him. I am of\r\nhis own race, and believe I can induce him to aid our cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see the paper.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal handed the paper to the insurgent general, and as he read\r\nstood gazing abstractedly over the water. She was yet a young woman,\r\nbut her face revealed both sorrow and determination. She was the\r\nwidow of the late insurgent, Dr. Rizal, who was the best educated and\r\nprobably the most manly of all who had opposed the exactions of the\r\nfriars in the interest of the native population. He had accomplished\r\nbut very little, and only a short time before had been shot by the\r\nSpanish soldiery, at the instigation of Lonzello and others. The\r\nwidow, after that event, seemed to have no object in life but to\r\ncarry on the work her husband had begun, and became an invaluable aid\r\nto Saguanaldo. She grasped situations he could not understand. She\r\nadvised with the good sense of a veteran. She went from place to place,\r\nsinging, talking and encouraging. She was always active in the cause\r\nof Philippine independence, and no task, no privation, was so great\r\nas to deter her. But perhaps the service that most appealed to the\r\nFilipino leader came through her friendship with Ambrosia Lonzello. She\r\nmanaged that the aling [7] might meet her lover, and at the same time\r\nprotected them from the friar, her father, so that he never suspected\r\nthat his enemy was the lover of his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"Go, and God bless you,\" said the insurgent, after he had finished\r\nreading the friar's address.\r\n\r\nAgain the boat pushed from shore, this time bearing, not Saguanaldo,\r\nbut Mrs. Rizal. When they arrived at the American flagship the\r\nwoman introduced herself to Admiral Rainey and gave a history of\r\nher husband's struggle and his fate. There was more feeling in her\r\nrecital than there had been in Saguanaldo's and the admiral was\r\nclearly touched by it. When she had finished the story she said:\r\n\r\n\"And, Admiral, our enemies are your enemies. The men who are fighting\r\nus are warring you also. I do not ask you to take my word for it,\r\nbut I bring you a circular which is being distributed over the island\r\nby Friar Lonzello, which I ask permission to read to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe admiral gave his consent and the woman read, translating from\r\nthe Spanish as she proceeded:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There appeared at dawn, on a sad day for this country, my beloved\r\n    sons, mastering our beautiful bay, the North American squadron,\r\n    that in a few months, and in spite of the heroism of our sailors,\r\n    destroyed our ships and raised upon one of our plazas, blessed\r\n    soil of the nation, the flag of the enemy. Do not ignore who\r\n    it is and what he attempts, who with such haughty pride, would\r\n    trample right under foot and impose himself upon us. It is the\r\n    alien, who wishes to subject us to his hard yoke. It is the\r\n    heretic, who desires to snatch from us our religion. It is the\r\n    insatiable commercialist, who, with the ruins of Spain and her\r\n    possessions, wants to swell his fortune. Unhappy Spain, if the\r\n    invader achieves his purpose! Poor Filipinos, the day that the\r\n    North American establishes here a permanent government! Very\r\n    soon you will see an impassible barrier between you and your\r\n    proud masters. You would then have neither office, employment\r\n    nor participation in the government or administration of the\r\n    cities. You would soon form a separate class, reviled as pariahs,\r\n    exploited like miserable serfs, reduced to the condition of day\r\n    laborers, and even to that of a beast or a machine fed with a\r\n    pinch of rice or corn, that your master would throw in your face\r\n    as a daily ration, in order to not see himself deprived of the\r\n    product of your labor and sweat; he regaled with the treasures\r\n    and fruits of the country that is yours and not his. You would\r\n    soon see your temples in ruins. The cross would disappear from\r\n    your cemeteries, the crucifix from your schools.... Fortunately\r\n    the Filipinos recognize all the perils that threaten. Perhaps us\r\n    a unit for your defense, and as a single soul raise to heaven\r\n    your ardent supplications. To arms, to arms, and to prayer! To\r\n    arms, for Spanish people, when its patriotism is wounded and its\r\n    religion attacked, is capable of great achievement. To prayer,\r\n    because the victory is with God and against infidels.\r\n\r\n                                Jose Lonzello, Bishop of Manila. [8]\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly afterward two boats put forth from the battleship for the\r\nshore bearing, not only Mrs. Rizal, but also a quantity of guns and\r\nammunition, as well as other equipments for campaigning. They were\r\nmet at the shore by Saguanaldo and his men with demonstrations of\r\njoy and Mrs. Rizal delivered her message from the admiral with the\r\nfeeling of triumph:\r\n\r\n\"Tell General Saguanaldo,\" the message went, \"to take and hold the\r\ncity of Manila. The American battleships will see that the Spanish\r\nforts do not interfere. But destroy as little property as possible,\r\nand maintain order and discipline.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\"BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night. The sports that had characterized the early\r\nevening, and the throng of gay promenaders that had ranged the\r\nstreets devoted at night to the business of pleasure instead of the\r\npleasure of business, had given place to rest and quiet. The city\r\nwas asleep--soundly asleep. It was the sleep of exhaustion that\r\ncomes after play that is the hardest of work. Gambling houses were\r\nclosed. The cock-pit, where a few hours before so many had gathered\r\nto participate in the great Spanish amusement, was deserted. Even at\r\nthe arsenal of Cavite, eight miles away, all was silent except for\r\nthe tread of sleepy sentinels.\r\n\r\nNew Manila, a modern city of more than a hundred thousand mixed\r\npeople, lay on the east of Passig river, a place of merchandising\r\nand cosmopolitan in its sport and games of chance. But, though it was\r\nthe more important of the two towns that were yet one, it was within\r\nthe walled city that the public buildings and the great cathedral\r\nwere located. Several stone bridges spanned the Passig river, each\r\nopening to a gate in the wall, which was often 150 feet through, but\r\nhollow, with rooms inside for the storage of forage, the stabling\r\nof animals, etc. In olden days the wall was a formidable defense,\r\nand was supplemented, where the river did not flow, with a moat. But\r\nnow the moat was neglected and covered with a green scum, and snakes\r\ninfested it while disease was breeded from it. And the wall was no\r\nlonger a defense. The soldiers were careless now. In truth, they were\r\npoorly paid and none too loyal to Spain. It may have been for this\r\nreason that at one of the gates, this night, there was an opening that\r\nwould admit a man, yet that was not observable from a distance. For\r\nsome strange reason no one seemed to be watching. Dark figures filed\r\ninto this gate, and crept under the walls to the true gate, entering\r\nthe city. A squad here, a few there, but, all told, hundreds. Again,\r\nfor some mysterious reason, no soldiers were on guard. The city was\r\nsafe anyhow; it had not been invaded for many years, and the proud\r\nCastilian felt that no one would dare to challenge him.\r\n\r\nUp unfrequented streets a few figures stole silently, unobserved. It\r\nwas so dark that, even had they been seen, few would have known that\r\nthey were armed. It was so silent that the city seemed a place of the\r\ndead instead of the living, and the superstitious natives who were\r\nthus stealing into the city were more apprehensive of apparitions than\r\nof the Spanish soldiery. As the men entered from many streets they\r\nconverged to one place. They then moved in small squads silently on\r\nthe sentries, capturing and silencing them. They moved to the public\r\nbuildings and took possession of them. They ran down the Spanish flag\r\nand in its place hoisted the insurgent flag. It was the crowning work\r\nof Saguanaldo.\r\n\r\nBefore this time, under his leadership, the insurgents had taken\r\npossession of Malalos, and even now they were active all over the\r\nisland of Luzon. An election was under consideration, and Saguanaldo's\r\ncandidacy for president was uncontested. It was a peculiar situation,\r\ndue to a lull before the storm. The American fleet, after having\r\nsunk the Spanish vessels, hesitated about taking possession of the\r\nislands lest complications might ensue; yet it was such a menace to\r\nthe Spanish forts that they realized their helplessness. With both\r\nthe Spaniards and Americans doing nothing, the insurgents were able\r\nto accomplish more than they had ever done before. Their success\r\nfilled Saguanaldo with delight. He arranged his troops to the best\r\nadvantage and was soon in possession of the city.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the stars winked out and over the wooded uplands to\r\nthe east the sun arose.\r\n\r\n\"It is the sun of Filipino independence,\" said Saguanaldo, pointing\r\nto the orb of day. \"How quickly has the darkness passed and how bright\r\nthe new era of the Philippines is.\" And then the soldiers cheered.\r\n\r\nWhen morning come and the people understood the changed situation\r\nMrs. Rizal called on Ambrosia Lonzello that she might felicitate with\r\nher. \"Ambrosia, the city has been taken and is in the hands of the\r\ninsurgents,\" began the older woman. \"It means Filipino freedom. Even\r\nif we are not able to maintain our own independence, then America will\r\nbe our protector. And the night is past. Oh, thank God, thank God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Rizal has won, in his wife,\" replied the younger woman. \"I\r\nthink he must rejoice, together with all the thousands who through\r\nthe centuries have given their lives for Filipino freedom. It must\r\nbe a happy day in heaven as well as earth. Even the sun seems glad\r\nand all nature rejoices this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the first time since my husband suffered so cruelly and unjustly\r\nI am happy,\" responded the older woman. \"You will wed Saguanaldo and\r\nyou will be happy with him. You will not have to see him shot in\r\ndisgrace, Ambrosia, but instead will be hailed as the wife of the\r\nliberator. But think not that I envy you or grumble at my fate. It\r\nis enough for me that I have realized the dream my husband dreamed\r\nand helped to do his work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\"CURSED WITH A CURSE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where is Ambrosia?\"\r\n\r\nBishop Lonzello addressed the woman who had borne a daughter to him\r\nin the home he had provided for her. He was deeply agitated with\r\npassion. The insurgents, who had elected a president and assembly,\r\nhad already nationalized the friars' lands, and the heresy of Aglipay\r\nwas waxing formidable, having possession of most of the churches\r\nthroughout Luzon. Lonzello had heard that his daughter Ambrosia\r\nhad been receiving attentions from Saguanaldo, the leader of the\r\ninsurgents, and the thought of it made him furious. It showed in\r\nhis face as he stood before the woman he had once loved and whom now\r\nhe supported.\r\n\r\nShe was deeply religious. To her, submission to the embrace of Friar\r\nLonzello had been obedience to God's messenger, and to this day she\r\nregarded him as a sinless representative of Deity rather than as\r\nhusband. It had been many weeks since Bishop Lonzello had deigned\r\nto visit her. There were other and younger women whom he met now;\r\nstill, he made no attempt to conceal the parentage of the girl, and\r\nthe general knowledge that he was her father had no bearing on his\r\nstanding either as a citizen or a priest.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, Holy Father,\" replied the Filipino woman meekly.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know. What do you suppose will become of your daughter\r\nif you let her wander about apart from your knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing bad, I hope. I have great faith in Ambrosia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing bad! Diablo! [9] Something has happened to her. Ambrosia\r\nhas disgraced us and blasphemed the God of her fathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Father, what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that the girl has gone astray, and you have not prevented her.\"\r\n\r\nIt apparently did not occur to him that both father and mother had\r\naforetime gone astray, and that it hardly behooved them to talk\r\nof lapses of their daughter while making religious professions\r\nthemselves. But the mother only turned pale and gasped.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how it can be. Tell me what you mean, Holy Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ambrosia has been meeting Saguanaldo, the enemy of his country and\r\nof religion--meeting him in secret and at night. I will not say that\r\nshe has fallen from virtue, for that is not so bad as lapsing from her\r\nGod and her duty. Fornication might be forgiven, but the sin against\r\nthe Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness. Woman, these meetings must\r\ncease. You hear me; they must cease.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman trembled and mumbled. Her eyes fell as she replied:\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best, Holy Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do your best! Damnation! Am I to be told that you will do your best? I\r\ntell you your daughter is the enemy of God, and you will only do your\r\nbest to stop her. Do your best, Diablo! Forbid her leaving the house;\r\nkeep her in prison; put her in a convent. This thing must stop. Woman,\r\ndo you hear me?\"\r\n\r\nThe mother faltered, and crossed herself. Apparently she was willing,\r\nbut had not the strength of character to enforce her will.\r\n\r\n\"You speak to her, Holy Father,\" she spoke hardly above a whisper. But\r\nthe irate priest turned away with an imperious gesture. As he turned\r\nAmbrosia herself entered from a side door and now confronted him.\r\n\r\n\"Sin-verguenza! [10]\" he hissed.\r\n\r\nThe girl straightened in dignity. \"I do not permit even my father to\r\nsay that to me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And I do not permit a daughter of mine to consort with a heretic\r\nand rebel.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest faced her with a sneer, and anger that shook his frame,\r\nwhile his fingers clasped and unclasped themselves. He looked ready\r\nto clutch her by the throat.\r\n\r\n\"I owe you nothing as a father,\" the young girl replied quietly\r\nbut bravely, \"since you did not give me even a name when you gave me\r\nlife. I owe you nothing as a mediator between God and man, because your\r\nlife and words have not convinced me that you have the ear of God. But\r\nI am as much above your accusations as I am above your habits.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop lifted his hand and struck at her. She was young and lithe,\r\nand avoided the blow. He picked up a stone and threw at her, yet again\r\nshe slipped away. Then he remembered himself, and, raising his hand,\r\nbegan the formal curse of the church. The girl listened with form\r\nerect and with a smile of defiance on her lips; but the mother fell\r\non her knees and as the anathemas poured in anger from the lips of\r\nthe father upon the child, she who believed they would come to pass,\r\nfell on the ground, and, writhing in agony before him, begged him to\r\ndesist. But it was all in vain.\r\n\r\n\"The eye that mocketh at her father, and despiseth to obey her mother,\r\nthe ravens of the valley shall pluck it out, and the young vultures\r\nshall eat it,\" the priest hissed; the mother groaned.\r\n\r\nThe priest straightened, and, pointing his finger at his daughter,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Cursed shall thou be in the city and cursed shall thou be in the\r\nfield. Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store. Cursed shall be the\r\nfruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine,\r\nand the flocks of thy sheep. Cursed shall thou be when thou comest\r\nin and cursed shall thou be when thou goest out. The Lord shall send\r\nupon thee cursing, vexation and rebuke in all that thou settest thy\r\nhand for to do, until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly,\r\nbecause of the wickedness of thy doing whereby thou hast forsaken me.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother lay with her face on the ground in a swoon as he\r\nconcluded. The priest walked away, and the eyes of the girl, his\r\ndaughter, followed him with fearless look.\r\n\r\n\"You have cursed me with life,\" she said. \"You have cursed me before\r\nthis, so that I can not even love as others do. That is the end of\r\nyour power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nFILIPINO INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Foolish, foolish, foolish!\" Mrs. Rizal was expressing her opinion\r\nof General Saguanaldo's action to the insurgent general himself.\r\n\r\n\"Caspita! Why is it foolish?\" asked the general.\r\n\r\n\"Because you may offend America, without the friendship of which you\r\ncan not win. It will be natural for the United States, after having\r\ncaptured the Philippines in the prosecution of a foreign war, to want\r\nto hold on to them. And if America chooses to hold the islands and make\r\nthem part of the United States in declaring the independence of the\r\nPhilippines you will only turn America from your side to oppose you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I want to fight side by side with America for freedom\r\nfrom Spain and then be subjected to that country? Did you not tell\r\nme that Admiral Rainey promised us independence?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He could not promise us independence, because he is not the\r\nsovereign of America. The most he did, the most he could do, was to\r\npromise to aid us in our fight with the Spaniards, and he could do\r\nthat only because his country, too, is at war with Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what advantage will it be to us to win, seeing that, though we\r\nmay win from Spain, we will lose to America? Por Dios, Señora! what\r\ndo you expect of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may not win independence, but you may win freedom and justice. You\r\ncan not win independence, anyhow. It is doubtful if foreign countries\r\nwould recognize the Filipino republic, even if America should depart\r\nand leave us to work out our own salvation. It is also doubtful if we\r\ncould win without America's help. Our hope is in securing the aid of\r\nthe republic that is giving Cuba her liberty, and repay the freedom\r\nthat is possible of attainment at this time and at no other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Independence is all that will suit me. I have not such a low\r\nconception of good for the Filipinos as you seem to have.\"\r\n\r\nThe Filipino impatiently and angrily entered his headquarters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal went away, sad at heart.\r\n\r\nAfter Saguanaldo had secured the city of Manila he had occupied the\r\npublic buildings, and a provisional government had been organized. The\r\nFilipino assembly at Malalos had adopted a constitution for the\r\nFilipino republic fondly hoping that the Americans would ratify\r\nit. Admiral Rainey had offered no objection; but it can not be\r\nsaid that he had advised the move. Indeed, he was merely awaiting\r\ninstruction from America; and yet the presence of his fleet was\r\nthe wholesome reminder that gave the provisional government power\r\nto maintain itself. Saguanaldo had been elected president and duly\r\ninstalled in office. The provisional government, among its first\r\nacts, had declared the friar lands confiscated and nationalized;\r\nand, while nothing had been done to enforce the new law, yet it was\r\na fact that native priests, representing the schismatic Filipino\r\nCatholic church, had secured possession of the larger number of the\r\nchurches and religious buildings throughout Luzon. This was not to\r\nbe wondered at, because there were nearly three million who were in\r\nrebellion against the foreign priests, and less than half that number\r\nwho were yet loyal to them. It was in Manila alone that the friars\r\nwere in undisputed control.\r\n\r\nPerhaps power may have turned the head of Saguanaldo. Mrs. Rizal\r\nhad told him that desire for honors had tempted him beyond the\r\npale of discretion. It might have been better had he organized a\r\nprovisional government and made it subject to the United States,\r\nsince, then, it might have been recognized and maintained by the new\r\ninvading power. But Saguanaldo denied personal ambition, and with some\r\ntruth. He had planned to make the day of the declaration of national\r\nindependence, which he had proclaimed, as the occasion of his marriage\r\nwith Ambrosia Lonzello, and had craved, as a young bridegroom, to\r\nshow her the honor, on that occasion, of having her hailed as the\r\npresident's wife, so that it was for her sake more than his own he\r\nsought the honor. So often this is true. Men seek wealth and place,\r\nnot so much for themselves as that they may please and impress a woman.\r\n\r\nBut things did not seem to be going right. Not only was Mrs. Rizal\r\noffended at his action, but when he, with a lover's ardor and\r\nenthusiasm, had laid the matter before Ambrosia Lonzello, she had\r\nresponded with tears.\r\n\r\n\"You do not love me,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Better than life, Camillo,\" responded the girl. \"But my heart tells me\r\nthat all is not well. You may declare independence, but you will not\r\nhave it until you first fight for it. I understand you are eager to\r\ngive me honors, and I appreciate the motive, but I can not marry you\r\nand become a burden to you until the bitter battle and hard struggle\r\nare past.\"\r\n\r\n\"That proves you do not love me,\" iterated the youth, sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"I shall prove to you I do love you by waiting for you until your\r\nwork is done, and then I shall marry you just as freely and just as\r\nproudly, though you are defeated and without honor, as if you are\r\nsuccessful and undisputedly president of the Filipino republic. It\r\nis the desire to do great and right things, the effort to do them,\r\nthat makes the soul great, whether the deeds be really done or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what pleasure will there be for me in the ceremonies of\r\ninauguration if you be not by my side?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was merely to give you pleasure, Camillo, if it was merely\r\nto gratify my pride or my selfish desire, I would become your bride\r\non the day set for the celebration of Filipino independence. But\r\nI must decline to marry you now for your sake and for the sake of\r\nFilipino independence. You shall need to be free from ties of home\r\nand responsibility to me. Unless you are free I do not think you\r\ncan win. Therefore, I refuse to hang around your neck in the battle,\r\nlest in doing so I cause you to be defeated.\"\r\n\r\nThe insurgent general plead, but in vain. Then he left, hurt and\r\nblaming her.\r\n\r\nThe day for inauguration and celebration approached, and where he\r\nhad expected the triumph of his life he faced defeat; where he had\r\nexpected exultation and bliss he was filled with disappointment and\r\nbitterness. Still, preparations for the ceremonial proceeded. The day\r\ndawned at last. General Saguanaldo was present as the central figure,\r\nand was received with cheers as the savior of his country. But neither\r\nMrs. Rizal or Ambrosia Lonzello were present. The people were merry\r\nwith feasting and noise, and the enemies did not show themselves. The\r\nceremonies of inauguration of the first Filipino president proceeded\r\nwithout interruption, and Saguanaldo made an inaugural address that\r\nwas favorably received. Yet to him it was a disappointment, because\r\nthe One was not there amid the thousands. It is always the One we care\r\nfor. The applause we crave is as nothing except the One applaud. The\r\nattainment we secure is mediocrity unless the One see us advanced and\r\nglories in our deed. And when, instead of the applause of the One, the\r\napproval and sympathy of the One, the One turns away with disapproval,\r\nthen we feel the deed were better not done, and the applause is a\r\nmockery. So the day was not a triumph to Saguanaldo. Even when the\r\nshades of evening fell, and the people brought forth the fireworks,\r\nwhen Manila was noisy with explosives and when she was gay with\r\nrejoicing and sportive people, Saguanaldo's heart was like lead,\r\nand he was bitter against the two who were the most loyal to him of\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nYet there seemed to be no reason for the heaviness of his\r\nheart. Perfect weather, a program without a hitch, expressions of good\r\nwill only, without a word or act of disapproval from the enemies of the\r\nrepublic, it seemed that Saguanaldo ought to have been happy. He was\r\nmaking history as his friends told him. He would hereafter be hailed\r\nas the liberator of the Filipinos. The day would be celebrated for\r\nyears as the day of rejoicing, the greatest in Filipino history. Why\r\ncould he not shake off the dread apprehension that lay like lead\r\non his heart? Is there such a thing as premonition, which tells one\r\nthings to come, when he is too hard of hearing to receive the message?\r\n\r\nBut Saguanaldo got through the day. As night came he was wearied,\r\nexhausted from sorrow. But with the weariness peace came to him. It\r\nis the ease that comes when nature would heal a wound. Saguanaldo\r\nthought it meant success for him. He would triumph anyhow, and\r\nthen they would believe in him. It was the fate of the great to be\r\nmisunderstood and derided by their friends, and he must greatly bear\r\nif he would triumph greatly.\r\n\r\nAt last the last fireworks had been exploded, the last hurrahs\r\nexpressed, and in the deep silence and serenity of the night Saguanaldo\r\nlay to rest, feeling that, after all, it was not a failure; and,\r\nbeing tired, he slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nSUBJECTED BY WORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late when Saguanaldo awakened the following morning. He had no\r\nmore than opened the casement blinds and stepped out on the veranda\r\nthan he saw that the city was unusually stirred. He went into the\r\nstreets to make inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"The American army has arrived and is disembarking,\" was the word\r\nhe received.\r\n\r\nHe walked into the heart of the city, and saw regiments of soldiers\r\nwearing the new khaki uniform, marching through the streets. His\r\nheart sank within him at the sight, and the warning Mrs. Rizal had\r\ngiven him recurred to his mind. Against these soldiers he knew he\r\ncould do nothing, and if he should seek to maintain the Filipino\r\nindependence that had been proclaimed the day previous, with hostile\r\nSpaniards on the one side and hostile Americans on the other, he saw\r\nat once that the case was hopeless. Yet, to give up his ambition, to\r\nforego independence for the Filipinos, to abandon the hope of making\r\nAmbrosia Lonzello his wife and the first lady of Luzon, to yield\r\nhis new title and new honors without at least a show of resistance,\r\nwas more than he felt like doing. He was perturbed, his mind flying\r\nfrom one resolve to another and his heart filled with one emotion\r\nafter another. \"And while he mused the fire burned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Camillo, the people are depending on their president to do something\r\nfor them in this crisis. Do you feel you can gather your troops\r\ntogether and successfully resist the Americans?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Rizal speaking. She was standing by his side. There\r\nwas no trace of exultation in her voice, but she spoke in deeply\r\nsympathetic tones.\r\n\r\n\"What would you advise?\" asked the insurgent general, meekly.\r\n\r\n\"Go as the accredited leader of the Filipino people and welcome at\r\nthe landing the general who comes from America. It will put America\r\non your side, and that means against the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nSaguanaldo considered. \"I will do it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIndecision had left him. A few moments afterward, accompanied by his\r\nstaff, and wearing his smartest uniform and accoutrement, he was\r\ndriven to the pier, where he asked to be conveyed to the American\r\ngeneral. His rank was at once recognized and he was taken to the\r\ncommander in charge, being received by him with marked civility,\r\nand consulted relative to the placing of the American troops. Cordial\r\nrelations seemed to be established between the two leaders at once;\r\nand Saguanaldo was very much gratified, after the noon hour, to receive\r\nfrom Judge Benjamin Daft, the man who had been sent from America to\r\nserve as civil governor of the Philippines, an invitation to visit\r\nhim on shipboard.\r\n\r\nJudge Daft was found to be a large man with a happy smile, who was\r\nvery cordial in his manner. Within a very few minutes after they met\r\nSaguanaldo was smoking with him and felt at perfect ease.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Judge Daft, \"that it is somewhat embarrassing for\r\nyou, as well as for me, that I come with orders to supercede you as\r\ngovernor of the Philippines. But you understand that the war is not\r\nyet over, and the final termination of things is not yet determined\r\non. I want to assure you, however, that the United States desires\r\nonly the welfare of the Filipinos. I believe it would be better for\r\nus to co-operate and make sure of victory than to quarrel and possibly\r\ndefeat the good that both desire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vd. disponza! All I want,\" said Saguanaldo meekly, \"is not to be\r\nhumiliated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel that as a representative of the American republic I can\r\nguarantee you that. You can be of invaluable service in the field in\r\nquelling disorder and bringing opportunity to your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not insensible to the fact that you, as representative of a great\r\nrepublic with standing already before the world, can command greater\r\nrespect than I could do as president of the untried Filipino republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very sensible view to take of it. I am very much pleased to find\r\nso liberal and disinterested a man as you at the head of affairs. It\r\nspeaks well both for the Filipino people and for the cause you\r\nrepresent. The American republic will remember such unselfish\r\nsentiments, and I am sure you will not lose by it.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Saguanaldo was flattered by these remarks. They made him\r\ndesire to appear oven more disinterested. He began:\r\n\r\n\"My chief concern is for the Filipinos. You can scarcely be ignorant\r\nof the injustice we have borne for centuries. We want freedom and\r\nopportunity. I ask these things for the Filipinos.\"\r\n\r\n\"The request does you honor, and it will do America honor to grant\r\nthem. Between us all we shall be invincible. With the prestige of\r\nthe American republic behind us we can command the good will of the\r\nnations. Rainey's fleet will be able to keep Cavite in subjection. The\r\nAmerican general is an old campaigner who has with him a seasoned army\r\nand the best of equipment, so that he will be able to stand before any\r\narmy that Spain can muster against him. Lastly, and most important of\r\nall, you, General, are familiar with the islands of the Philippines,\r\nand can render service as a guide and leader such as no other man on\r\nthe earth can give; and in serving us you will be serving yourself and\r\nthe cause of Filipino liberty. I have heard much of the Fox of Luzon,\r\nand have felt that if I could formulate a plan that would enable us all\r\nto work together harmoniously, it would be a victory second only to the\r\ngreat victory that Admiral Rainey won in this beautiful bay of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do all I can, Judge Daft. As you have said, together we shall\r\nbe invincible.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I shall feel no hesitancy about landing. I did think\r\nthat perhaps it was not a courteous thing to do, to come from\r\nacross the great ocean to your shores and then ask you to take\r\nme in as something more than guest. But in war we can not stand on\r\nceremony. Your disinterestedness and your courtesy have been so great\r\nthat you have made it much easier for me to do my duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men wandered over the ship, Judge Daft showing Saguanaldo all\r\nthe wonders of the modern man of war. They discussed various matters\r\napart from the questions most in their minds, and always Judge Daft was\r\ncourteous and apparently keenly appreciative of Saguanaldo. Following\r\nthe visit of Saguanaldo to the battleship, Judge Daft visited him\r\nin the public building of Manila, and, with his permission, the\r\nAmerican flag was run up over the town in place of the flag of the new\r\nrepublic. Within two days Saguanaldo went into the interior as the\r\nguide rather than the commander of an expedition which the American\r\ngeneral sent against some Spanish troops that had, under the direction\r\nof Bishop Lonzello, been preparing to attack Saguanaldo in Manila,\r\nbut that, after the Americans landed, had retired into the interior.\r\n\r\nIt was only after they had gotten into the interior that Saguanaldo\r\nbegan to realize his position. It came to him that, though he had\r\nbeen hailed as president of the Filipino republic, another occupied\r\nhis capital, and the Filipino republic was at an end; though he had\r\nbeen the leader of an insurrection, the insurrection was inoperative;\r\nand he was fighting under another power; though he had celebrated the\r\nindependence of the Filipinos, Filipino independence was gone, and\r\nhe was seeking to subject the people to another foreign nation. While\r\nhe was under the spell of Judge Daft's influence, he had not noticed\r\nit, but now it came to him with all its meaning and bearing all\r\nits bitterness. He felt that he had lost. He felt that he was not\r\nonly unable to cope against the arms and warships of this strange\r\nrepublic from across the seas, but he was also unable to meet their\r\nwiles--diplomacy, they called it. He had heard the word used and now\r\nhe was beginning to understand what it really meant.\r\n\r\n\"I am a fool,\" he said to himself. \"Ambrosia knows it, and so she\r\ndespises me. But if I must be beaten I will show her that at least\r\nI am no coward.\" It was heroism surviving folly.\r\n\r\nSo ever it is the one who influences human actions, whether they be\r\ngood or bad, public or private, in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MIGHTY DIPLOMAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day following the departure of the allied troops from Manila an\r\nEnglish ship steamed into Manila bay, and among those who landed was\r\na Jesuit, who came as papal nuncio, a special envoy of the pope,\r\nthe astute Leo XIII. He at once hunted up Bishop Lonzello and was\r\nsoon closeted with him over wine and cigars, discussing the situation.\r\n\r\n\"You see yourself the Spaniards cannot stand before the Americans. They\r\nrepresent the old order, the Americans the new; the old must pass. It\r\nis more than useless, it is folly, to stay with the passing policy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Spaniards are friends of the church and the Americans are\r\nits enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear you are short-sighted, Brother Lonzello. The Americans are\r\nto be Catholics, while the Spaniards have only been Catholics. A\r\nlive dog is better than a dead lion. But the Americans are not to\r\nbe despised. The republic is entering on world politics, and if the\r\nHoly Father could control that nation he would as good as control\r\nthe world through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he can never control that nation; it is given to heresy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not agree with you. Neither does the Holy Father at\r\nRome. Remember, I am speaking for him. Already we have two million\r\nvoters in America. United, that means the balance of power. It is\r\nsomething that any candidate may well covet. But that is not all. As a\r\nresult of this war America will add the Philippines to her territory,\r\nwith possibly Cuba and Porto Rico besides. In time, states will be\r\nformed of these territories, and they, being almost wholly Catholic,\r\nwill give America to the true religion. It is something worth working\r\nfor, and the prospect makes the Holy Father eager that you should\r\nfall in with his plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe it possible to make America Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nThe apostolic nuncio puffed his cigar in silence a moment. Then he\r\nleaned forward and said:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we induce the capitalists of America to import a million\r\nItalians to be naturalized. Suppose we secure jobs for a million\r\nMexicans in America and see that they are naturalized. Suppose that\r\nfinally Central America and Mexico are annexed to the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is treason to the Latin and the Spanish races.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It is taking advantage of new conditions. America is developed\r\nto the point where it is necessary that she should expand. If she\r\nshould dig the Panama canal, it will be natural for her to close\r\nin on territory that divides her, and excuses are more easily\r\nfound than grapes in a vineyard. It will aid rather than hinder the\r\nCatholic. American capitalists can pay higher wages than either the\r\nItalians or Mexicans receive and still obtain them cheaper than they\r\nget labor today. Catholic workmen will merely supercede heretics. If\r\nMexico is taken there will be a leveling up as well as a leveling down,\r\nand the peon will gain immensely by the change.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it means an entire change of policy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old policy has been worked to the end, and a new one is\r\nnecessary. We are living in an age of machinery. Peon and slave\r\ncan no longer yield the returns that the hireling can do by the aid\r\nof machinery. The returns from the Philippines can be quadrupled;\r\nand we were foolish to forego the rich harvest because it involves\r\na change of tenants.\"\r\n\r\nThe friar was flushed and angry. He almost shouted.\r\n\r\n\"But that means that the Spanish friars are to lose power in the\r\nPhilippines. Do you realize what you are asking us to forego?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. You have had your opportunity and have made a failure of\r\nit. The natives have been rebelling against you for three hundred\r\nyears. Now, Aglipay has stirred a schism that has taken from Rome\r\na majority of our churches. So long as the Spanish friars remain in\r\npower the dissatisfaction will increase rather than diminish. It seems\r\nprovidential that America should come at this time, for it gives the\r\nsupreme pontiff an opportunity to transfer you and by diplomacy save\r\nthe work you have done for the church.\"\r\n\r\nThe friar sank back in his chair and thought. Then he mildly said:\r\n\r\n\"It is a hard thing you ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but your order asked the same thing once of the Jesuits, and,\r\non order of the Pope, we were expelled from the Philippines for many\r\nyears. Now the supreme pontiff is merely exercising his right of\r\ntransfer relative to the three orders of friars in the Philippines. It\r\nis his voice, and you will not dare disobey it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, of course, we shall have to submit. But it is hard. Shall\r\nwe have to lose our property, our lands?\"\r\n\r\n\"I come with a mission to the Americans relative to them. I have not\r\ntalked with the Americans yet, but I can assure you justice. As for\r\nthe churches and convents, you have lost them to the church, and it\r\nis part of my mission to regain them for the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to submit. But I can not overcome my hatred of the\r\nAmericans and I will not remain to knuckle to the natives. I wish I\r\nmight strike them one hard blow.\" He brought his fist down on the\r\ntable with a thump. The Jesuit was silent a moment. Then he said:\r\n\"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. You know the response.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lands which the supreme pontiff gave to Legaspi he may take\r\nagain from the heirs of Legaspi.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not for the life of me see where the holy church will profit\r\nfrom the change, seeing that Spain is a Catholic country and America\r\nis heretic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spain will remain true to the church even if she loses. But if America\r\nwins, then we may not only win back into the fold the schismatics of\r\nthe islands, but stand also a chance of winning America, and with\r\nit the world. It is the greatest, opportunity the church has had\r\nfor years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not yet see how you expect to win America.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been working for the conquest of America for centuries,\r\never since Columbus gave it to the world and dedicated it to Christ\r\nand his viceregent. After the heretics had taken possession of it, we\r\nhave labored without cessation to win it back. We brought believing\r\nemigrants to the cities until we control many of them. We now have\r\nten million population and two million voters, controlling several\r\nstates and holding the balance of political power. Already the\r\npoliticians are taking cognizance of us, But, more important than\r\nthis, the statesmen are looking for a power that can withstand the\r\ntide of Socialism that is sweeping over the land and are ready to\r\nmake concessions to us for our influence.\r\n\r\n\"The most far-seeing of American politicians recently remarked that\r\nsome day Socialism would become a menace to the world and that\r\nthe strongest influence to combat it would be the Roman Catholic\r\nchurch. Acting on this belief he has already been negotiating for\r\nour support. It was the Catholic vote that saved America from the\r\ndomination of the middle class when threatened by the mob in 1896. It\r\nwas members of my order who fanned the flame that led to the present\r\nwar, so that America might enter on world politics. The end is not\r\nyet. The Pope sees the importance of our plans, and you must submit. We\r\nintend that in the future it shall be known that he who would succeed\r\nat the polls must have our favor. We have the power now, and we shall\r\nuse it. The Brotherhood of Jesus has been banished from almost every\r\ncountry on the face of the globe, but in spite of this we have remained\r\nloyal to our extreme oath, and have not for a moment faltered in our\r\npurpose to make America Catholic. We are now at the point of success,\r\nand the supreme pontiff sends me to command you to yield. Is your\r\nloyalty sufficient for that? Remember, we have been driven from land\r\nafter land, and show yourself as true as the Jesuits have been.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Lonzello did not reply. But he filled the two glasses, and as\r\nhe raised his glass to his lips he proposed the toast:\r\n\r\n\"Leo, the greatest of Popes. When he speaks it is time for the rest\r\nof the world to be silent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the toast had been drunk the Jesuit father referred no more\r\nto the topic about which he had been talking. They were sitting by\r\nthe window looking out on the street where quite a few people were\r\npromenading. As one woman after another passed they discussed the\r\ngood points of each and waxed merry over the wine, rehearsing many\r\nsalacious stories. Finally Ambrosia Lonzello passed. The Jesuit,\r\nlooking on her, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"That is the woman for me. She has the woman's ten perfect points. Do\r\nyou know her, Brother?\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop's lips were dry and his heart was enraged as he answered,\r\nfeebly, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you give me opportunity to hear her confession?\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop knew what was implied by the request, and his heart was\r\nfired with the heat of his passion. He made a motion once to kick\r\nthe Jesuit down stairs. But the knowledge that he was a special\r\nenvoy of the Pope, and, more than that, the counter-fire of anger at\r\nAmbrosia, and the fierce flame of his hatred of Saguanaldo, caused\r\nhim to desist. Indeed, the first flames had eaten so deeply into his\r\nheart that there was little left for the flame caused by the insult\r\nto touch. He merely answered, quietly, after swallowing a little:\r\n\r\n\"That is the sweetheart of the insurgent general, Saguanaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is good,\" responded the Jesuit. \"You hate him and would\r\nlike to wound him to the death before you go. Behold, the Lord hath\r\ndelivered him into your hands. Promise me that the girl shall confess\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nHe seized the bishop's arm and leered lewdly at him. \"You really must,\r\nfor I am mad from continence while on the water. Some day I will do\r\nas much for you. Won't you, good Bishop?\"\r\n\r\nBishop Lonzello clenched his fist and hissed through his teeth,\r\n\"Yes; and may God damn your soul to hell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nA LITTLE GAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to meet you as a citizen, but of course it is against\r\nthe policy of my country to receive you as an envoy from the Pope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Judge Daft, we shall not quarrel over a little thing\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Jesuit talking to the new American governor. He had no\r\nintention of abandoning his purpose, but he meant to approach it by\r\nindirection. He knew something of diplomacy himself, and so devoted a\r\nfew minutes to casual conversation. He was by nature and practice an\r\nexpert in the recounting of stories, having found that an art which\r\nwon where no other art was honored, and the two passed a pleasant\r\nhalf hour together. Finally, as Rodriguez Violeta, the Jesuit father,\r\narose to take his departure, he said:\r\n\r\n\"If I speak purely as an individual, I presume you will not object\r\nto my asking that you treat us fairly relative to churches and\r\nchurch lands.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. I have no objection to telling you that I desire to\r\ntreat you fairly in these and all other matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would not object, then, to issuing an order that, until\r\nthe matter can be settled in the courts, the possession of churches\r\nis to be secured to the party in possession, whether that party\r\nbe the Roman Catholic church or the Filipino Catholic church. This\r\nseems to me to be fair, and I believe is in accordance with American\r\njurisprudence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to issue an order of that nature to the soldiers in\r\nthe Philippines. Anything that is mutually just will be granted you;\r\nand, while I can not receive you as envoy of the Pope, I shall take\r\npleasure in hearing your recommendations as an individual of experience\r\nwho is capable of understanding your people and presenting your side\r\nof the controversy in a fair and liberal way.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can be of any service to you, it will afford me pleasure to\r\nbe commanded by you. I do believe, however, that the holy father,\r\nthe Pope, has a plan which would save you very much trouble. I wish\r\nyou would permit me to present it--as an individual.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are at perfect liberty to do that. Be seated and I will hear you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit re-seated himself. The camel's nose had found entrance,\r\nand the rest of the body was about to follow.\r\n\r\n\"The Spanish friars are at the bottom of all the trouble in the\r\nPhilippines. The Aglipayan schism came because of them, and the\r\nmany revolts that have disturbed the islands for the past three\r\ncenturies have been because the people wanted native rather than\r\nSpanish priests. Now Leo, who has always been friendly to America\r\nand Americans, is desirous of removing the Spanish friars from the\r\nPhilippines.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Daft leaned forward, evidently interested. \"This concerns me\r\ngreatly,\" he said. \"Outline to me the plan more fully.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit ignored the request. Instead of answering him directly,\r\nhe observed: \"This would greatly simplify matters and make your\r\nproblem sensibly easier of solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am conscious of that,\" asserted the Judge, betraying eagerness,\r\na weakness which revealed that he was being beaten in diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\"America can easily handle the Spanish army. Your future problems\r\nwill lie with pacifying the natives and adjudicating the conflicting\r\nclaim of the two churches.\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand the situation just as it presents itself to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have splendid opportunities here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, to make a fool of myself?\" laughed Judge Daft.\r\n\r\n\"That is an opportunity that knocks often at every man's door. But\r\nI was not thinking of that. I was merely musing--speaking aloud the\r\nthing I thought--and a man never ought to do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I think he never ought to speak aloud anything else than\r\nhis undisguised thoughts. I shall insist on hearing this novel thing,\r\nthe undisguised thought of a Jesuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant, opportunity to make yourself a reputation that shall lead\r\nto future political power. Who knows but that the presidency of the\r\nUnited States lies along this path?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not ambitious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that; indeed, I was not thinking so much of you as an\r\nindividual as of you in your position. I was musing, you know. We\r\nJesuits naturally look into the political possibilities of things,\r\nand I am astonished at the possibilities I see before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"War generally brings a warrior to the front. The people take pleasure\r\nin preferring their military heroes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true. I perceive you are an astute politician. Because\r\nyou are so far-sighted, you cannot fail to realize that if you are\r\nenabled to satisfactorily settle a dispute that has been raging\r\nfor three centuries, and give America the Philippines to exploit,\r\nyou will have distinguished yourself in a way that is sure to bring\r\nreward. Perhaps not at once. The military hero may come first, while\r\nyour reputation is in process of building; but if you succeed, your\r\ntime will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people are very forgetful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But men of affairs are not, and they are the folks who count. The\r\nsubstantial business men, who see the advantages that accrue to\r\nthem because of these things, will remember; and the holy church\r\nnever forgets. We alone poll two million votes in America now. But,\r\nremember, I am only musing. I am asking nothing. I shall report,\r\nhowever, the kindness you have shown me, which will, I feel sure,\r\nhelp to make your task easier.\"\r\n\r\n\"For your suggestions I thank you. You shall be welcome whenever you\r\nchoose to call--in your individual capacity.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a sly dog, Judge. I confess myself completely out-generaled\r\nin diplomacy, and have dropped it. Hereafter I wish to be known only\r\nas your friend. In the language of the Spaniards, buenas noches,\r\namizo mio.\"\r\n\r\nNever more of a diplomat than when he was claiming to have abandoned\r\ndiplomacy, the priest took his departure, knowing that he had left\r\nthoughts that would cling and bear fruit. He understood that, though\r\nthe Judge might have been able to handle the simple-minded Saguanaldo\r\nby his diplomacy, every good has its better and he had been bested\r\nwithout realizing it. It is the true test of wit that cuts so smoothly\r\none does not know of his wound at the time it is given.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit sought Bishop Lonzello and spoke imperiously and exultantly:\r\n\r\n\"I am to have an order from the American governor that the soldiers\r\nare to protect in possession either side of the controversy that\r\nmay have possession of churches and convents. You want to summon all\r\nyou can command and seize at night on all these buildings that you\r\ncan. You haven't half of them now, and by this means you may secure\r\npractically all of them. And the American army is pledged to maintain\r\nyou in possession of them, once you are in charge. There is no time\r\nfor delay.\"\r\n\r\nLonzello was not a man who needed to have explained to him the\r\nadvantage this gave the friars. He sprang up, before the Jesuit was\r\nthrough speaking, and began preparing to go on the street and set\r\nhis machinery in motion.\r\n\r\n\"You will not find me sleeping,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit leered: \"Am I to confess that young woman as my reward?\"\r\n\r\nLonzello opened the door and showed him from the room, kicking at\r\nhim as he passed. Once the Jesuit was outside, however, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I will send the girl to the cathedral at ten o'clock tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThen he closed the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nSECRETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmbrosia's mother had again received a visit from Bishop Lonzello. This\r\ntime he had insisted that his daughter confess in order that she\r\nmight be forgiven and the curse pronounced against her rendered\r\nnull. It is possible that the bishop himself believed that the\r\ncurse held power. Certain it is that the woman feared it and had\r\nwept almost constantly since that day that it had been pronounced\r\non Ambrosia. Now she fell in with the idea of Ambrosia confessing\r\nand securing release from the curse. She brought the matter before\r\nher daughter, who demurred. Then she urged it with such insistence,\r\ndeclaring that filial duty required some reparation on her part,\r\nthat Ambrosia was touched, and, at the same time, being plagued by\r\nthe importunity of her mother, consented to confess, and even to\r\nconfess before the foreign friar, in the church against which she\r\nwas in rebellion. Indeed, she preferred the foreigner to one of the\r\npriests who had long resided in the islands and fallen with its ways.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, Ambrosia Lonzello at the cathedral before the\r\nconfessional in which Violeta was seated. She did not know it, but\r\nthe moment she entered the confessional the door had been locked\r\nbehind her by an attendant, at the signal from the officiating priest.\r\n\r\nAmbrosia knelt at the confessional, troubled in heart. She felt out\r\nof place in a church against which she was in rebellion; and, while\r\nfeeling that she ought to atone for disrespect shown a father, still\r\nshe knew not what to say. She knelt in prayer, and as she prayed,\r\nthe priest within the cell gazed upon her with lustful eyes, studying\r\nher points as a sportsman might study the creature he meant to kill\r\nand devour. As he looked, the appetite for sex, the fiercest passion\r\nthat sways mankind, took possession of and began to rage within\r\nhim. Finally he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Daughter, have you been guilty of disloyalty to the holy church? Have\r\nyou consorted with those who are the enemies of the religion and of\r\ntheir country?\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, the question, so unexpected, disconcerted the girl kneeling\r\nbefore the cell with her eyes so downcast that she did not see the\r\npriest within the cell. Various emotions surged within her. Her\r\nfirst impulse was to deny rebellion to true religion and rush from\r\nthe church. But she concluded that it were best to remain and admit\r\nthe thing that had caused her mother sorrow. So she confessed:\r\n\r\n\"I have met the general of the insurrectionists and am his friend. But\r\nI am not an enemy of the true religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you met him at night?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, although, knowing it compromised her, said softly, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Late at night or early in the morning?\"\r\n\r\nAgain she faltered as she replied, \"Both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you two alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he employ embraces or kisses toward you?\"\r\n\r\nStill lower, hardly above a whisper, \"Yes; but we are engaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he caress you, feeling over your person with his hands--like\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nThe priest's hands were upon her, and he was taking liberties no\r\nother man had ever done. She tried to arise from the cushion where she\r\nknelt, but strong arms about her prevented. Then the priest stepped\r\nfrom the confessional and held her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Did he kiss you--like this?\" the priest asked. \"Did he press you to\r\nhis bosom--like this?\" She was now in his embrace, struggling in vain\r\nto free herself. \"Nay, do not struggle, little bird. If you grant\r\nsuch favors to enemies of religion, you ought not to refuse them to\r\nrepresentatives of the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you call yourself a representative of the Lord when you do\r\nthese things?\" she managed to ask between his kisses.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Chuleta, did not the Holy Ghost overshadow even the blessed\r\nvirgin? And is it not an honor to be embraced by one who stands,\r\nas it were, in the very person of Christ? If you have yielded to the\r\nenemy of the Master, ought you not yield to the true representative\r\nof the Master, and so make atonement to him?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer, she managed to free one hand and slap his face.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know the manner of my country,\" said the priest, thrusting\r\nhis hand in her bosom. \"The instructions for confession, issued by\r\nSaint Liguori, says: 'Kisses, embraces, squeezing of the hands and\r\nsimilar things not indecent, if done only as marks of affability or\r\nbenevolence, according to the custom of the country, in an honest way,\r\nare not sins.' Again: 'To speak, hear, read, write indecent things\r\nwith a legitimate reason is no sin. Hence, in order to administer\r\nthe sacrament of penance priests can lawfully hear and read all they\r\nwish.' Tell me what this insurgent did to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl wrenched herself away, and, flying to the door, tried to\r\nopen it. The priest stood and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"The case is hopeless,\" he said. \"You might as well confess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no regard for your sacred calling? Have you no regard for\r\nthis sacred place?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is more sacred than love,\" said he. \"Saint Liguori says:\r\n'Concerning the locality, every external carnal action, although\r\nhidden in a sacred place, is a sacrilege. However, cells, a cloister,\r\nthe vestry, the roof above the church, its door and vestibule, are\r\nexcluded.' You see we are excused.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excused! Oh, the wickedness of your heart! I wonder not that\r\nSaguanaldo broke away from the church you represent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, child, you misunderstand. If it is given to Peter and his\r\nsuccessors to forgive sins, then whatever they may do can be no\r\nsin, but is, as it were, the act of God himself. You who think your\r\nhighest virtue is to love God ought to esteem it an honor that you\r\nhave provoked the love of God's representative on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fiend!\" shrieked the girl. \"Help, help!\" The words echoed from the\r\nwall, but seemed to penetrate no further.\r\n\r\nThere was no response, and the priest smiled: \"It is foolish to resist\r\nthe Lord who loves you,\" he said. \"It is in my power to absolve you\r\nfrom sin, and even to grant you indulgence to commit that which might\r\nunder other circumstances be sin. Don't be foolish, child.\"\r\n\r\nHe sought to grasp her in his arms again, but she eluded him. Then\r\nhe began in a pleading voice:\r\n\r\n\"Is it my fault that I love you? Why are you not as kind to me as you\r\nwere to that heretic? You are in the confessional, and I can not only\r\nabsolve you from sin, but I am also pledged to secrecy. Be kind to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, loathsome thing, I hate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love, indeed! You pollute the word, like you do the office you hold\r\nand the building here and all else that should be sacred.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know not how I love you. Oh, how I long toward you! 'Item\r\nordinarie mortalia nabenda sunt escula in ore, seu lingua in ore\r\nintroducta vel excepta. [11]' Are you not, indeed, the bride of\r\nChrist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, devil that you are! It is you who have confessed to me, and though\r\nyou live to be a century of age, confessing every day such villainy\r\nas this, I could but hate you worse with every morn, and never could\r\nforgive you. If there is hell, where he who burns in lust and anger,\r\nburns in flame, then there's your place. If there is a heaven that\r\nhears the voice of innocence, sending the white angels down to give\r\nit succor, then will the heaven open now, and white-robed creatures\r\nwill deliver me. Oh, thou divine Christ, come now and judge between\r\nus. Oh, God of purity, deliver me from this, thine enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand. I wish you no wrong. Love is not wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love thinketh no evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love is not expressed in words. It never can be told, but in embraces\r\nand fondlings. Christ, how I love you and long toward you! 'Delectatio\r\nvenerea autem seu carnalisest ca, quea oritur ex commotione spiritum\r\ngenertioni inservientum et sentitur circa partes genitales.' You can\r\nnot comprehend how I am stirred.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know not how you fright me. Oh, sir, I plead with you to let\r\nme go. Do not for a moment's passion damn your own soul and ruin me\r\nforever. Show but the manhood that will set me free, and for that\r\nmanhood's sake I will say that, though tempted, you had the hardihood\r\nto overcome, and I, for that hardihood that won, will be silent as\r\nto all you have done and said.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think I am? Does the sportsman set the bird free when\r\nit chirps? I am not so foolish or so weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me ask one thing: Did my father deliver me into your hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the Bishop Lonzello your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then I understand some things that have been dark. I also have\r\nfull license now for anything I can do, and you can find no fault\r\nin the fault that marked both your parents. Come and give me a kiss,\r\nlike a good girl, Chuleta!\"\r\n\r\n\"God in heaven, send me protection,\" gasped the girl in a faint voice.\r\n\r\nA moment later the priest grasped her in his arms, and his lips seized\r\nhers in a long, hard, passionate kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nWHAT RUIN MEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning Ambrosia Lonzello was released from\r\nthe convento [12] in which she had been detained the night long,\r\nand staggered into the street. Suffering physically, nervous almost\r\nto prostration, and mentally overwhelmed with horror, she walked,\r\nshe scarcely knew where. She felt that she dare not go home--that\r\nfather and mother had betrayed her, and that now she was an outcast,\r\nwith no friend and with no place on earth. Even heaven had been deaf\r\nto her call, and she felt that the divine Father, too, and the Christ\r\nwho had sympathized with Magdalene, cared nothing for her.\r\n\r\nIt is a wise provision of nature, apparently attesting her sympathy\r\nwith suffering, that when sorrow and pain tug almost to the point of\r\ndestruction at the heart or body, she provides her own opiate. In\r\nthe article of death almost all creatures are at peace, and fear\r\nnothing. Gradually this numbness came over Ambrosia. She apparently\r\ncould not realize all that had happened. She ceased to feel the full\r\nburden of her anguish, and became numb, as it were. She no longer\r\nplanned, she followed her heart. Indeed, she became more conscious\r\nof the glory of the morning than of her own ruin, and in spite of\r\nher mind's declaration that there was no place in the world for her,\r\nshe saw nature beautiful and friendly about her and felt that not\r\nyet had God excluded her.\r\n\r\nHer brain would not work, but her heart thought of Saguanaldo and those\r\nwhom she had thought to be her friends. It was this thread invisible\r\nthat led her to the camp of the Americans. When she arrived she met\r\nfirst a minor officer and asked to be shown to the commander in charge.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Miss, just go into the tent and wait until I bring him,\"\r\nwas the reply to her request.\r\n\r\nShe entered the tent and seated herself. As she waited a feeling of\r\ndrowsiness overpowered her. Finally, scarcely knowing what she did,\r\nshe threw herself on the cot in the tent and slept. The soldier who\r\noccupied the tent peeped in and saw her.\r\n\r\n\"Gee,\" said he to his messmate, \"she don't want the commander now. She\r\nhas already made a night of it and needs nothing so bad as sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's wait till she awakens and then keep her to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have some rent for our tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ambrosia awakened several hours later one of the soldiers was\r\nat her side and the tent was closed and darkened. She remained in the\r\ntent two days, during which time she was repeatedly assaulted by the\r\ntwo soldiers. Instead of finding a refuge, she had merely fallen into\r\nanother trap. There really is no escape for a creature that is hunted,\r\nespecially if that creature be a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nA CHANGE OF SEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen next Ambrosia Lonzello regained consciousness she was reposing\r\nin a room familiar to her, at the home of Mrs. Rizal. After her\r\nlast bitter experience she had been cast into the street in a fever\r\nand delirium, and, happily for her, had soon been picked up by\r\nMrs. Rizal, who had taken her to her home and nursed her through a\r\nsiege of fever. Now, as Ambrosia opened her eyes with a rational look,\r\nMrs. Rizal, smiling on her, said:\r\n\r\n\"You are better now.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I come to be here?\" asked the girl in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"I found you wandering on the street in a fever and brought you here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then it is true,\" cried the girl in horror as memory came to\r\nher. \"I must go, I am not fit to be in this room with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" responded the older woman, smoothing her pillow. \"You\r\nhave been having bad dreams, and you must forget about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure they were dreams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. You have been very sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has been to see you often, and will come again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she say where I had been?\"\r\n\r\n\"She said you had started to confessional, and I suppose the fever\r\ncame upon you while you were on the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl lay silent for a time. Finally tears gathered in her eyes. It\r\nwas a good sign that the power of crying had returned to her; tears\r\nare a mark of humanity, and only they who are dehumanized or rendered\r\noutcasts by persecution or sorrow are unable to weep. Mrs. Rizal\r\nstooped and kissed the girl. It was the one act of sympathy she needed\r\nto break up the fountains of her heart, for it showed that she was\r\nnot entirely abandoned, and Ambrosia wept unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\n\"You will be better now,\" said Mrs. Rizal when the flood of tears\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\n\"Does--General Saguanaldo know?\" asked Ambrosia.\r\n\r\n\"If he did, he would have come.\" Again it was the wisest word that\r\ncould have been spoken, simple and unlearned though it may have been,\r\nfor it intimated that her lover had not ceased to care, and this was\r\nof all things the most consoling. Yet a moment after it occurred to\r\nAmbrosia that if Saguanaldo had desired to come and not been able, he,\r\ntoo, had been burdened and in trouble. Then it was, with a woman's\r\nabnegation, Ambrosia thought of the woe of her dear one rather than\r\nof her own sorrow, and this, too, was an advantage to her.\r\n\r\n\"Are they having trouble at the front?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Mrs. Rizal replied. \"The friars have seized on the churches,\r\nthe hospitals and convents, and now the American troops are maintaining\r\nthem in possession of the property they hold. It is the same as though\r\nthe Americans, after Saguanaldo had turned the city of Manila over\r\nto them, had turned against him and were making war on him and in\r\nfavor of the friars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone is behind this change,\" declared the girl after a moment's\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is a Jesuit here, an envoy from the Pope.\"\r\n\r\nAmbrosia sat up in bed, her eyes distended in horror.\r\n\r\n\"Then it is true,\" she said. \"It was not a dream. It was good in you\r\nto care for me and not desert me in my pollution, but I know now it\r\nis true, and you need not deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\"--began Mrs. Rizal.\r\n\r\n\"I will not talk about it,\" interrupted the girl, \"and God will\r\nreward you who are so different from other women in that you did\r\nnot turn away from the victim as from a thing polluted. No, do not\r\ninterrupt. I am strong now. There is only one thing I may do with\r\nthe remnant of life left to me. I have no longer father or mother,\r\nGod or redeemer. I have no place in society on earth. I have no lover,\r\nno chance for home or respectability. But I have hope and a purpose. It\r\nhas just come to me. Do not deny me in the plan I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will listen to your plan, but you are weak and not yet able to\r\ndo anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl leaped out of the bed, let down her hair and hunted a pair\r\nof shears. \"Cut off my hair, closely,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I fear you are not yet over the fever,\" remonstrated Mrs. Rizal.\r\n\r\n\"I have had no fever,\" said the girl, \"and I am well. I shall be\r\nstrong for vengeance and justice. Nay, do not fear, good Mother Rizal,\r\nI am sane.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not told me your plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as Ambrosia Lonzello has lost all place in society and on\r\nearth, she had the fever and is dead. She is merely another victim of\r\nthe friars. I, who stand before you, am not Ambrosia Lonzello. I am\r\na man, now and henceforth. I feel within me the vigor and courage of\r\nmanhood, proving the transformation. Henceforth I shall live only\r\nfor vengeance and to assist Saguanaldo, who had been Ambrosia's\r\nfriend. Cut off the hair that belies my sex, and then we all go to\r\nthe field to give our lives for the cause.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal expostulated, but in vain. She argued as to the girl's\r\nlack of strength, but was actually laughed out of the idea. At last\r\nshe fell in with the plan, both as being in accord with her own desire\r\nand also as being perhaps the only course open to the girl after what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nA few hours afterward, then, the transformation was completed. The\r\ngirl, with her hair cropped close and wearing a suit that had belonged\r\nin days past to Dr. Rizal, looked very much like a vigorous young\r\nman, and Mrs. Rizal was gratified to find that she showed no sign of\r\nfailing physical powers. Indeed, she was to all appearance well again.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I have merely been transformed into a new creature,\" said\r\nthe youth, smiling and showing two rows of perfect white teeth. \"My\r\nname is Hilario Agonoy, at your service.\" Bowing low.\r\n\r\n\"When shall we go to the seat of war?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mañana [13],\" replied the youth, gaily. \"Don't you see that Ambrosia\r\nis dead?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nOFF TO THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Mrs. Rizal and her companion, known as Hilario Agonoy,\r\nset out into the country to join Saguanaldo.\r\n\r\nAfter they had proceeded a few miles beyond the city they walked\r\nalong through the jungle over a trail that was rough, stumpy, stony,\r\nand at places almost overgrown and hidden by bamboo growths, trees,\r\nferns, and tropical grasses. Occasionally they came to a grass hut in\r\nthe midst of a little clearing, and here the friendly peasants, who for\r\nthe most part, knew Mrs. Rizal, extended their hospitality in the form\r\nof invitations to remain with them. In places the women would be at\r\nwork in the rice fields or cultivating tobacco or sugar cane. They were\r\nbarefoot and bare armed, wearing only shifts that but partly enveloped\r\nthem, meagerly concealing their fine physiques. Sometimes a man,\r\nbarefoot and wearing only two garments, would be seen following the\r\ncarabao, the native ox, as it dragged the wooden plow that scratched\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThere were fields of abace or native hemp, rice and indigo. Sometimes\r\nthe pilgrims would pass through groves of mahogany or cashu and see\r\nmen at work with bolos, felling trees for lumber, or with sierras\r\n[14] slowly cutting boards from teque or mahogany. Sometimes they saw\r\nthem grinding cane in the trapiche [15]. Sometimes at night they saw\r\nthe zanita, the Philippine bee, working by moonlight and storing its\r\nhoney on the underside of slanting branches; and one day, when the\r\nbees were asleep Agonoy climbed a tree while the two laughed at his\r\nstruggles, and the honey he obtained constituted their supper. They\r\npassed haciendas [16] and pueblos [17]. Once they came upon a cemetery\r\nwhere a couple of corpses were hanging, because the friends of the dead\r\ncould or would not put up enough money to pay for the continuous burial\r\nin consecrated ground. Occasionally they were \"given a lift,\" to use an\r\nAmerican expression, on a carata, behind a carabao. They saw at times\r\nthe timid galina del monte, the wild chickens that ranged the forests,\r\nand at other times were regaled with the anona or custard apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow and then there were streams to cross. For the most part these\r\nwere waded or passed over on logs felled to bridge them, though\r\nin a few cases there were rustic bridges made of bamboo curiously\r\nwoven together.\r\n\r\nEverywhere poverty was visible, poverty abject and pitiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow and then they came to villages where there were fine brick churches\r\nand conventos; and a few other good buildings, beside many huts that\r\nunder the operation of the Spanish law poor people were enabled to\r\nbuild. The churches were guarded by American soldiers, and in almost\r\nevery village the inevitable convento was occupied by officers of the\r\nAmerican army. Invariably the friar lands were better cultivated and of\r\na better quality than elsewhere, and resembled the old plantations in\r\nthe American southern states when they were kept in good condition by\r\nslave labor; for the peasants bore the marks of poverty and hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather was enervating at all times, and often dismal from the\r\ndrenching tropical rains, for it was the rainy season. Streams were\r\nup and the trails were muddy. During the heat of the day a choking\r\nmalarial steam arose from the earth as the moisture evaporated. The\r\npeople were kept much indoors. It was too disagreeable even for a\r\nrevolt against Spain.\r\n\r\nThey inquired in private for Saguanaldo, and were told that he had\r\ndeserted the American army and gone into the interior. Others of the\r\nFilipinos had followed his lead in desertion, but it seemed that\r\nthey had not yet come together into anything like an army. As to\r\nhis exact location, nobody knew. The Americans were looking for him,\r\ntoo, and the natives were careful, even before Mrs. Rizal and Agonoy,\r\nto not say too much.\r\n\r\n\"The Americans are going to force us into fighting them,\" a Filipino\r\ntold them in one of the villages. \"They are overbearing and insulting,\r\ncalling us 'niggers' and treating us as inferiors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared as much. The Philippines are too rich for them to give\r\nup. They want the islands for themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me show you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Filipino led them to a hut where a man lay on a mat within,\r\nevidently seriously injured.\r\n\r\n\"The Americans gave him the water cure. This punishment was first\r\nlearned from the Filipinos themselves.\" Said the Filipino: \"They laid\r\nhim on his back and pinioned his limbs. Then they put a funnel in his\r\nmouth and held his nose while they poured him so full of water that\r\nit ran out of his nose and eyes and ears. It was horrible torture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did they do it?\" asked Agonoy, with sinking heart.\r\n\r\n\"In order to force him to reveal the whereabouts of Saguanaldo. You\r\nsee why I have to be careful as to what I say. All I can do is to\r\ndirect you to go on still further.\"\r\n\r\nOn they went passing into the primitive. They went even into the\r\nregion of the head hunters, where the beautiful and symmetrical\r\nvolcano, Mayon, lifted its green sides against the blue sky beyond;\r\nand here they saw the warriors who adhered to the old ways, and,\r\nsevering the heads of their enemies with the bolos which they used\r\nalso for clearing the roads through the bamboo brakes, dried them and\r\nretained the gruesome relics, reduced to a few inches in diameter,\r\nas trophies of war.\r\n\r\nBut the savage tribes were kind to the pilgrims. They, too, were at\r\nenmity with Spain and all they regarded as foreigners, ready to take\r\nsides with Saguanaldo should he call them forth.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me they are more civilized and gentle in their way than\r\nare the people from the West,\" said Agonoy.\r\n\r\n\"No people are so destructive and wasteful as those who call themselves\r\ncivilized,\" returned Mrs. Rizal. \"I am of them and understand them,\r\nand I tremble for the future of the Filipinos. The Americans will\r\nbring the foreigner and the natives will disappear before him. They\r\nwill bring the machine, and such as remain will be chained to it,\r\nand compelled to render to them a tribute many times in excess of\r\nthat which Spain has exacted from you. You have been poor, but you\r\nhave not starved. Civilization brings the slum and abject hunger.\"\r\n\r\nAgonoy answered not. He was thinking about something that to him seemed\r\nto be a dream, yet which he knew to be true--of the awful experiences\r\nof a girl, to all intents and purposes dead, who had suffered at the\r\nhands of civilization, the apex of possible human suffering.\r\n\r\nSo the two walked on and on. Sometimes they heard of Saguanaldo,\r\nand again lost trace of him. They passed on into wilder regions, into\r\nplaces infested by mosquitoes, snakes and other loathsome things; to\r\nregions where mango birds were numerous and where the pigeon of the\r\ncrucifixion with the red cross on its breast had its habitat. Often\r\nlost, they could go but slowly; sometimes they slept alone in the\r\ngreat forests. But ever they pressed on.\r\n\r\nFinally, after days out, the two travelers came upon Saguanaldo in\r\na grass hut in a thicket near the southern end of the island. As\r\nthey approached, piloted by a friendly Igorrote, Saguanaldo arose in\r\nevident surprise. After exchanging greetings Mrs. Rizal said:\r\n\r\n\"General Saguanaldo, we came to take with you the fortunes of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Señora Rizal, you are welcome. We shall need all the soldiers we can\r\ngather, and your advice will be valuable in this time of trouble. The\r\nname of the boy\"--\r\n\r\n\"Hilario Agonoy,\" said Mrs. Rizal, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome. Señora Rizal and the boy; we shall want you both\r\nat the council of war which we are about to hold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Private soldiers are not often taken into councils,\" suggested Agonoy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, they are when there are only three present,\" suggested\r\nSaguanaldo, with grim humor. But Agonoy did not join in the laugh\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\nBy Saguanaldo's side sat Bishop Aglipay, Obispo Maximo, the leader of\r\nthe revolt against the friars. Only these four were left, though others\r\nwere ready to take up arms when Saguanaldo suggested. It was a pitiful\r\nremnant of the gay throng that had such a short time ago celebrated\r\nPhilippine independence, hailing Saguanaldo as president. Saguanaldo\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n\"We shall need to confer as to the best mode of procedure, because we\r\nare in desperate situation. We are in a much worse shape than before\r\nthe American army came. Then we were in possession of more than half\r\nthe churches in the Philippines, and besides that, held Manila. But\r\nnow I have been tricked away from the Philippine capital, and the\r\nAmerican troops are protecting the churches for the friars.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did they come to get the churches which you had?\" Mrs. Rizal\r\nwas addressing Aglipay. She knew, but wanted his version of it.\r\n\r\n\"We were fearing nothing,\" the leader of the schism explained, \"when\r\nin one night, just before the American troops arrived on the scene,\r\nSpanish soldiers seized on the churches while we slept. The next day\r\nthe American troops came, and as, it appears, they had been ordered\r\nto protect in possession of their properties whoever they might find\r\nin possession of them, they at once became allies of the friars.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here I, who was with them,\" exclaimed Saguanaldo indignantly,\r\n\"I, who had given them peaceable possession of Manila, was ordered\r\nto protect the friars in possession that they gained by trickery.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\" asked Mrs. Rizal.\r\n\r\n\"Do? I passed the word to as many of my followers as possible, and\r\nfled. Not one of them came, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems to have been the best thing you could have done--for the\r\nfriars,\" returned Mrs. Rizal. \"In doing that you became rebellious\r\nagainst the United States, and now, I understand, have the American\r\narmy on your trail.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true; but what else could I have done? Had I done nothing I\r\nwould have been fighting for the Spaniards, and, as it were, against\r\nmyself. I had the Americans against me, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But now the case is hopeless. So long as the Spaniards were your\r\nenemies, without outside help, there was some hope that some day\r\nyou might have beaten them. But, now that the Americans are allies\r\nof the Spaniards the case is hopeless. It is too great a nation for\r\nyou to combat. Recall how the Spanish fleet melted away before the\r\nAmerican fleet in the bay of Manila and tell me what chance you will\r\nhave before the giant foe from across the seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why the Americans turned against us, when they came here\r\nto fight the Spaniards,\" said Aglipay gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"The reason is very plain,\" returned the woman.\r\n\r\n\"Was it that they were offended at me because I had been made president\r\nof the Filipino republic?\" asked Saguanaldo.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the American people, then, not lovers of liberty, and are they\r\nmerely waging a war of conquest in the name of liberty?\" Aglipay asked.\r\n\r\n\"The answer is found in the fact that there is not a member of the\r\nFilipino Catholic church in all America, while there are ten million\r\nRoman Catholics there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, political reasons, then,\" suggested the bishop. He as an olden\r\nfriar understood something of how politics modified policies.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Though your schism might have a greater power here than the\r\nfriars have, it commands no influence in America. The American who\r\nfavors the other side will have friends at home, while one who would\r\nfavor you would find enemies there that might destroy his influence\r\nand his future. You are not only fighting the American army here,\r\nand the friars here, but also, as it were, all the people of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men reflected moodily for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to do but to fight until we perish,\" said Saguanaldo.\r\n\r\n\"One should not die for a cause unless there is good cause for the\r\nsacrifice. Do you find that the people rally to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the insurgent bitterly. \"They sympathize and see the\r\ndanger, but it seems they have not the interest that dares to risk\r\nall and fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even the men you can command are not disciplined or drilled or\r\nproperly equipped.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The Americans have the equipment I had collected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor would the various tribes be likely to cling together,\" suggested\r\nthe woman.\r\n\r\n\"This cursed race feeling! The only way the tribes will stay together\r\nis when they war with each other; then they are together in battling\r\neach other.\" There was dogged bitterness in Saguanaldo's words.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how you can win by fighting. What does a grinning\r\nskull care for vengeance? But there is a way in which you may win,\r\nGeneral Saguanaldo.\"\r\n\r\n\"How,\" asked the general, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"By yielding. It is often the surest way of winning. You have an\r\nunexpected ally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"None other than the Pope at Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Pope!\" exclaimed both men in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The Pope understands that the Spanish friars are at the bottom\r\nof the long trouble in the Philippines and is glad of the war that\r\nwill give him an excuse for removing them. That will be a victory\r\nfor him; and, as he has already managed to get possession of the\r\nchurches, it means a victory for the church as well. If you can get\r\nthe friendship of America, so that the country will treat you justly,\r\nit will also be a victory for the Filipino people.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am to lose all that I have struggled for?\" protested Saguanaldo.\r\n\r\n\"And I to lose the organization which I have built up through the\r\nyears?\" added the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\"Better to lose these things alone than to lose both them and your\r\nlives as well,\" suggested Mrs. Rizal.\r\n\r\n\"If a common soldier might be permitted to speak\"--faltered Hilario\r\nAgonoy.\r\n\r\n\"Say what you wish,\" suggested the insurgent general. \"We are all\r\nequal in our love for the cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to fight even though I know we must lose. There is some\r\nsatisfaction in punishing those who have treated us so unjustly, and\r\nevery blow we strike will cause them to have the greater respect for\r\nthe Filipino people in the future. If we could punish that Jesuit\"--\r\n\r\n\"And Bishop Lonzello,\" added Aglipay.\r\n\r\n\"To my mind there is nothing left us to do but fight,\" added General\r\nSaguanaldo, visibly pleased. \"We in the interior can conduct a\r\nguerrilla warfare that will cause the enemy to respect us, and make\r\nthe new masters more inclined to do us justice. I trust, Señora Rizal,\r\nyou will not desert us if we take this action.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal arose. \"I am with, you to the last,\" she said. \"I am not\r\nafraid to die, either, just as my husband died before me. If I may\r\nbe asked to designate the service I am to perform, I would ask that\r\nthe youth here and I be permitted to go among the people and arouse\r\nthem with our songs and speeches. We can rally you a force, General.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, and God bless you. There is one question I would ask you if I\r\nmay speak to you in private.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Saguanaldo and Mrs. Rizal stepped a few paces away.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Ambrosia?\" he asked. \"Is she well, and does she remain\r\ntrue to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ambrosia has the strength of a man,\" returned Mrs. Rizal, \"in the\r\ncause of Filipino independence. She is true, and will ever be near\r\nyou--in spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGE YELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal and Hilario Agonoy, after much effort, succeeded in\r\nrallying a force to Saguanaldo. It was a motley crowd, composed of\r\nrepresentatives of several different tribes, armed with shot guns,\r\nbolos and whatever they could secure, and garbed all the way from a\r\nsoldier's uniform to breech clouts and feathers. There were perhaps\r\nfive thousand of them, all told.\r\n\r\nWith this force, Saguanaldo began a careful march toward the north part\r\nof the island. Mrs. Rizal and Agonoy went ahead and discovered that a\r\nforce of Americans were advancing inland to meet them. Consequently\r\nSaguanaldo stopped at the banks of the Rio Grande, and prepared\r\nrifle pits. He also removed from the bridge that crosses the stream\r\nthe flooring, leaving only the sills, the girders, and cross pieces\r\nabout every seven feet apart. The first night after these preparations\r\nhad been made the American troops appeared and encamped on the bank\r\nopposite, some 300 feet away.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos were not inclined to attack, but relied on the river,\r\nwhich was high and threatening, to keep the enemy from them. Yet the\r\nsecond night, about 11 p. m., the cackling and crowing of chickens at\r\nfarm houses on the other side, and part way down stream, told them\r\nthat some movement was in progress. It was immediately across the\r\nstream from where Agonoy had been stationed with some threescore\r\nnatives. At the time the clatter began the moon came out, and it\r\nwas revealed that a force of Americans was at work on the margin\r\nof the river, evidently trying to launch some rafts with a view to\r\ncrossing. Agonoy directed the men to fire, and a fusillade from the\r\ninsurgents soon drove the Americans to cover. Hiding behind trees,\r\nstumps, rocks or anything that would afford protection, they remained\r\nsilent until the fire of the insurgents ceased. Then, after a time,\r\nthey again made endeavor to launch their rafts, until the forces\r\nunder Agonoy once more drove them away.\r\n\r\nThis first victory, won by the insurgents, gave them great\r\nencouragement and Agonoy was publicly commended by the general. It\r\nis still remembered that when this occurred the young officer first\r\nblushed fiery red and then broke into tears.\r\n\r\nThe day following the Americans undertook by daylight the thing which\r\nthey had before tried at night. But they began in a little different\r\nway. They were seen to dump some rafts into the river over a high\r\nbank, and then two men, stripped to the skin, dived into the stream\r\nand began to swim across. The insurgents peppered at them, while the\r\nAmericans from the other shore shot at every head among the Filipinos\r\nthat showed itself. Bullets splashed on all sides of the swimmers,\r\nbut none took effect. As they drew to shore they were protected by\r\nthe bank, the Filipinos being unable to fire at them because of thus\r\nexposing themselves. Then it was seen that they had borne a cable\r\nacross the stream. It became apparent that the intention was to hitch\r\nit so some object on the Filipino side of the river and thus form a\r\nmeans of propelling the rafts across the stream. But the two naked,\r\nunarmed white men, alone on the Filipino side of the Rio Grande,\r\nwere unable to find a place to which to hitch. Daubed with dirt and\r\nglistening with the water, they raced back and forth under protection\r\nof the bank, looking for stump or tree, but in vain.\r\n\r\n\"There is a stump in the rifle pit, up there,\" remarked one.\r\n\r\n\"We must hitch to that,\" said the other. \"Make you some mud balls.\"\r\n\r\nThey scooped up mud from the river and hugged to their breasts the\r\nballs of filth as they started to climb the banks directly ahead of\r\nthem. Meantime the American soldiers fired over their heads. As they\r\narose over the bank and stood erect looking into the rifle pits, they\r\nbegan throwing the mud balls. The first one struck Agonoy full in the\r\nface, and the young commander, with eyes and mouth full of dirt, began\r\nclawing at the mud and retreating. The natives, seeing this, and not\r\nknowing the nature of the new weapon, broke into a run and retreated.\r\n\r\nMeantime a raft had started across the stream, with two men and\r\nthe clothing and guns of the men who were now tying the cable to\r\nthe stump. When midstream the rope slipped and the raft upset,\r\nprecipitating all in the water. The two men reached shore, but the\r\nclothing of the men who had swum the river was lost. Other rafts were\r\non the way. Before Agonoy could rally the natives, a small force of\r\nAmericans had crossed over.\r\n\r\nThen began an opera bouffe charge; naked and begrimed Americans and\r\nmen in khaki against naked and half-clothed representatives of a half\r\na dozen races! And as the Americans came on a run they broke into a\r\ncollege yell:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Rock chalk,\r\n                              Jay hawk,\r\n                              Chicken hawk,\r\n                              Tommy hawk,\r\n                              K. U.!\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar laughable twist on the \"U.\" that added to the\r\ngrotesqueness of the incident.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were reinforced by a small body of men who had\r\ncrossed the bridge on the girders, and as these came up yelling\r\nother college yells and firing as rapidly as possible, at nothing,\r\nthe Filipinos, in utter consternation, broke ranks and fled.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few hours, however, Saguanaldo, who understood\r\nthe lay of the country thoroughly, had again brought his forces into\r\norder and had forded the river a little lower down. He was now on\r\nthe side of the stream nearest Manila, while the Americans, after all\r\nhad crossed and they had leisurely partaken of dinner, were hunting\r\nhim further in the interior. It had been a bloodless battle, with\r\nthe victory apparently on one side and yet the advantage decidedly\r\non the side of the defeated.\r\n\r\nAfter the troops had been collected Saguanaldo called Agonoy to him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"The honors of the first encounter belong to you. Name the reward\r\nyou desire.\"\r\n\r\n\"All I wish is to serve my country further,\" replied the youth with\r\nanother blush. \"Permit me to go ahead to Manila and inform you how\r\nto take the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another should accompany you, so that if something happens to one\r\nthe other may escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to go to spy out the land,\" asked Bishop Aglipay.\r\n\r\n\"You, Bishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Let each go in his own way and alone. Then we can report and\r\nwill not be in collusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that suit you, Señor Agonoy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be satisfied. If we can wreak vengeance on the bishop's\r\nenemy, the Jesuit, I shall be repaid for all dangers and suffering\r\nthat may ensue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go, and success attend your efforts,\" returned Saguanaldo. And\r\nhe looked on the youth with searching eyes that for a third time\r\ncaused Agonoy to blush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nWORLD POLITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to invite Judge Daft to occupy this convento,\" suggested\r\nVioleta to Bishop Lonzello, a few days after he arrived.\r\n\r\n\"You will do nothing of the kind,\" replied the bishop. \"It is a\r\nlittle too much, you coming here and ordering us from the islands;\r\nbut, as if this was not sufficient, now you want us to give up our\r\ndormitories. I may yield the land for the good of the church, but I\r\nam not going to stand this individual insult from a stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, be reasonable,\" persuaded the Jesuit. \"I am doing it solely for\r\nyour good. You will get the rental for it, and a republic is never\r\nniggardly in such matters. The convento is really the only suitable\r\nbuilding in Manila for the purpose, and we can use the tender of\r\nit in cementing a very valuable pact. Depend on it, you will lose\r\nnothing by it. Another thing\"--\r\n\r\n\"Nombre de Dios! Is there anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course there is. We must syndicate the friar lands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the United States undertakes to deal with the friars as\r\nindividuals, it will be able to handle them to its notion. But by\r\ncombining the 1,500 owners in a syndicate where half a dozen have\r\nthe full control of things, we can dictate terms. You can see the\r\nadvantage of this. It is the modern way of doing business. You managed\r\nthe seizure of the churches well; now you must organize the friars\r\nfor purpose of selling their lands advantageously.\"\r\n\r\nThe two priests discussed the matter further, and though Lonzello\r\nwas bitter against the Jesuit and in his heart resented the new order\r\nthat was being installed, he saw the force of the arguments, and ere\r\nlong started on a trip through Luzon for the purpose of organizing\r\nthe syndicate. During his absence the Jesuit took occasion to tender\r\nthe convento to Judge Daft and to point out its superiority for the\r\nprivate uses of the new officials. The argument was valid, because the\r\nconvento was the best residence property in Manila. The Jesuit went\r\nfurther and offered not only the church property in Manila, but also\r\nin Malalos and throughout all the Philippines. Judge Daft argued with\r\nhis conscience, against his inclination to have the use of the best,\r\nand ultimately accepted the offer. With the American governor housed\r\nin the convento where the Jesuit lived, meetings became informal and\r\nfrequent. The two drove together in the evenings along the Plaza de\r\nGotta. They played golf together of afternoons. They met and talked\r\nas friends; and the papal nuncio constantly and persistently employed\r\nthe power of suggestion for developing his plan.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think we can elect you president short of eight to twelve\r\nyears, but it will come some day,\" he told Daft while at golf. Small\r\nbusiness is transacted in the shops, larger in offices, and the\r\ngreatest business of the world is forwarded at social gatherings and\r\nin games.\r\n\r\n\"I supposed I was to be elected next week,\" suggested the governor,\r\nfacetiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, the people of America will probably demand a military man\r\nfirst. There is such a one who begins to loom up as a possibility, and\r\nhe understands the situation thoroughly. Besides, he is not so timid\r\nas the present president. The latter means well, but he will not act\r\nuntil he is pushed into action, while in adopting new policies, such\r\nas are coming up now, we need a bold man. You want to keep your eye\r\non Colonel Rosefield. We have had our eyes on him and he understands\r\nit. We mean to see that he has a military record manufactured for him,\r\nso he can run for president. After him comes Judge Daft.\"\r\n\r\n\"You Jesuits are too deep politicians for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will at least admit we are not dreamers, Judge. I am in earnest in\r\nwhat I say. No man in the service in Cuba has received the advertising\r\nso far that this Colonel Rosefield has had, and there is a reason for\r\nit. He will emerge from the war the central hero of it all, even if we\r\nhave to make him the winner of a battle where he was not present. More\r\nhistory is made by well circulated reports than there is by deeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge laughed: \"I wonder if you intend to circulate reports\r\nabout me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends. If you do justice by us, we will see to the advertising,\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by justice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Holy See is doing you inestimable service in withdrawing the\r\nSpanish friars from the Philippines, because it is thus removing the\r\nvery source of the quarrel and enabling you to gain a world reputation\r\nby accomplishing within a few years that which the Spanish government\r\nfailed to accomplish in three centuries. That is a good start toward\r\nthe presidency.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems you have tricked me into payment for that service, which\r\nI freely acknowledge, because you have used the order that those\r\nin possession of church property shall be maintained in possession\r\nof that property to your advantage, by seizing on all the property\r\nbefore the American troops arrived on the scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mere act of justice. That property belonged to the holy church\r\nbefore the schism took it away, and we have merely done to the schism\r\nwhat it first did to us. This is, therefore, a mere act of reparation;\r\nbut we are not ungrateful to you that you have made it possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge was secretly troubled at the part he had played. It was not\r\nin accord with his conception of right. But he readily saw that it\r\nwas good politics, played for him by a power he did not understand. He\r\nventured to say:\r\n\r\n\"I wish to do exact justice by you, and no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall ask no more. In a sense the church in general has had\r\nreparation; but what about the friars?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"His holiness, the Pope, can not banish them and thus leave the\r\nfield clear for you, unless they can be remunerated for the lands\r\nthey hold--not the churches, which belong to Rome, but the lands,\r\nwhich belong to the friars. It is a matter of justice to pay them for\r\ntheir property, and it would be of inestimable benefit to the United\r\nStates to get rid of this troublesome element.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand the ground on which these churches were built belonged\r\nto the Spanish government, and that the government contributed\r\nconsiderable cash besides toward their erection. This being the case,\r\nthe churches will belong to the United States after we shall have\r\nacquired the Philippines, and you would owe the federal government\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Spanish government gave the lands and donations to the church\r\nthey ceased to belong to Spain. You Americans would not claim again\r\nland that had been patented to settlers. The churches belong to\r\nRome, where all titles to church property are vested. You will have\r\nto settle with Rome for them. The land belongs to the friars, who,\r\nas agents of Spain, developed the country and paid for the land. You\r\nwill have to settle with the friars for them if you would banish that\r\ntroublesome element.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Malalos convention declared them fortified to the Philippine\r\nrepublic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you recognize that republic? You know you dare not do it.\"\r\n\r\nDaft understood that; after a pause he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"What are the lands worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not been appraised, but I would estimate their value at\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen millions of American money.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me pretty high.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it is reasonable, considering the cost it would be\r\nto America to settle the trouble with the friars still here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me you are faring pretty well, considering that you have\r\nrestored to you the churches that were in revolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will win with the friars gone, but there are a number of things\r\nthat will have to be settled by arbitration after the war is over. You\r\nmust act as America's representative to the Pope.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Daft started back in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible. It is against the policy of the United States to\r\nrecognize the temporal power of the Pope by sending an ambassador to\r\nthe Vatican.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. This war will make it necessary. You may disguise him\r\nunder the name of agent, if you will, but a representative will\r\nbecome a necessity. It would be a big thing for you to be that\r\nrepresentative. You must have your picture taken with the Pope.\"\r\n\r\nThe boldness of the declaration again startled Judge Daft.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know the temper of the American people. They would not\r\nstand for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would give you two million Catholic votes and make your election\r\nas president an assured thing. It is big politics we are playing\r\nthese days, and you might as well be in on it as anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you make good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't your national chairman declare that the only power that\r\ncould save America from Socialism was the Catholic church? Did not\r\nthe Catholic vote go to your present national executive, for the\r\nfirst time in history that the republican party got that vote? You\r\nare asked only to follow the policy set by your party, and to reap\r\nthe result in honors and power. Why do you suppose the head of the\r\nchurch deserted Spain in this war, when Spain is a Catholic country,\r\nand has been on the side of the Protestant United States, if he did not\r\nexpect recognition of his services? Do you not suppose we understood\r\nfrom the time the Maine was blown up that the people might be aroused\r\nto start this war? The hierarchy is hereafter to be a dominating\r\npower in America, and you are to be president. It is a big thought,\r\nand you must think over it, Judge.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge did think over it and the apostolic nuncio kept from his\r\npresence several days in order to give him opportunity to ponder the\r\nsubject. When next the two men met the chastened attitude of Judge\r\nDaft and his evident desire to be agreeable was to the discerning\r\nJesuit ample proof that the leaven was working.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" he added to himself, \"but that the fine, bold\r\nmaterial we are getting on our side may necessitate the removal of\r\nthe good-hearted old man who rules but fears to move. We dare not\r\nwait too long when plans are ripe and boldness is necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHISM BURIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few mornings after this the apostolic nuncio was walking along the\r\ncalzada by the coast, musing over his plans, when he chanced upon\r\nthree American soldiers with a Filipino prisoner. He was inclined to\r\npass on with only a cursory glance, but his ever-alert mind, always\r\nspurred to observation, prompted to closer scrutiny. Then he saw that\r\nthe soldiers were drunk. This was not important in his eye, because,\r\nunder the canteen system inaugurated by the American government,\r\nand the influence of the tropics working on the nerves of the boys\r\nso far from home, and of the Filipino beverage, vino, drinking was\r\nrather common with the soldiers. Indeed, the tropics were playing\r\nhavoc with the morals of the youth in khaki.\r\n\r\nKipling has thus expressed the languorous feeling that gets into the\r\nbones in the tropics:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ship me somewhere east of Suez where the best is like the worst,\r\n  Where there aren't no Ten Commandments, an a man can raise a thirst;\r\n  For the temple-bells are callin' an' it's there that I would be--\r\n  By the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea--\r\n      On the road to Mandalay,\r\n      Where the old Flotilla lay,\r\n      With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay!\r\n      Oh, the road to Mandalay,\r\n      Where the flyin'-fishes play,\r\n      An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the bay!\r\n  When the mist was on the rice fields an' the sun was droppin' slow,\r\n  She'd git 'er little banjo an she' sing 'Kulla-lo-lo!'\r\n  With 'er arm upon my shoulder an' 'er cheek agin my cheek,\r\n  We uster watch the steamers and the hathis pilin' teak.\r\n\r\n\r\nVino, that decoction from the cocoanut which in time crazes the\r\ndrinker and makes him run amuck, had been getting in its work on\r\nthe Americans, and they were more or less beside themselves even\r\nnow. Besides, insidious fever, the mali-mali, which weakens the will,\r\nleaving the victim chiflado, ready to imitate the movements of any\r\nwho pass; the almost constant vibration of the soil that tells so on\r\nAmerican nerves; the absence from home and accountability to civilized\r\nrestraints; the enervating tropics that seemed to tingle in their veins\r\nand vanish, make them devilish; and the daily sight of half-naked\r\nwomen, whose ideals of morality were tropical rather than American,\r\nwere telling on the habits of many a homesick mother's boy. The\r\nPhilippines became a hot-bed in which erotic passions developed into\r\nnational scandals. The nuncio himself, with grim desire to strike at\r\nthe Americans when it profited his cause to do so, had procured the\r\nlicensing and inspection of bawds, under sanction of the American\r\ngovernor, the fees for inspection going to church charities. So the\r\nsights of drunken American soldiers did not even interest him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there was something about the prisoner that was striking. His\r\nvery bearing, his mannerism, his cut of tie and clothing proclaimed\r\nhim to be a priest. If he was a Roman priest, the nuncio felt he must\r\nrescue him; if he was an Aglipayan priest, then he might gratify on\r\nhim the cruel desire to torment which is born in some and which he\r\nhad fostered by feeding. He determined to put the matter to an instant\r\ntest by a bold stroke. So he approached the prisoner, crossing himself\r\nand saying:\r\n\r\n\"As I live, if this is not Dr. Maximo Voliva, born Aglipay.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a venture, but it struck home.\r\n\r\n\"And you are that devil, Violeta, who has robbed us already of our\r\nchurches. I am not pleased to form your acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still reprobate and unregenerate, I see,\" returned the Jesuit. \"At\r\none time we might have made terms with you, but that day is past. We\r\nhave the whip hand now and you are in our power. Man (speaking to a\r\nsoldier), run to the nearest house and borrow a couple of spades or\r\nshovels, and be quick about it. Follow us down the beach.\"\r\n\r\nThe three men walked down the coast to a more secluded spot.\r\n\r\n\"What do you plan to do to me?\" asked the erstwhile Maximo.\r\n\r\n\"It will be time to discuss that when we come to it. Do you wish to\r\nreturn to the true church and receive absolution?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in the true church,\" replied Aglipay, hardly above a\r\nwhisper. \"You will not murder me?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not murder snakes and vermin when we destroy them. And to think,\r\nyou used to be a priest in the one true church. You see now what your\r\nambition brought you to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ambition!--I would talk about ambition if I were you. You, who have\r\nmastered the poor Filipinos; you, who are planning for control of\r\nAmerica! Ambition--may God forgive you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry I can not return the compliment of praying for your\r\nforgiveness, but you are so unrepentant. However, I will hear your\r\nconfession if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will confess to God and not the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might as well begin your confession then.\"\r\n\r\nAglipay paled. But he faced the nuncio and spoke in a calm voice:\r\n\"How can you profess religion, you who are so cruel, so ambitious, so\r\nlicentious? Do you really believe, or is it an open mockery with you?\"\r\n\r\nVioleta laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered he, \"there is a God, and truth, too, in religion. But\r\nit is moral to rise to your full height, though you may trample others\r\nas you rise; and though it seem a pity to devour the weaker creatures,\r\nno one thinks about it. It is a part of feeding, and is right. We\r\neat a woman's flesh as 'twere a fowl's, and take a poor man's life\r\nas though a bird's; that is, the great do, those with authority. It\r\nis doing this that makes them great. Repression is but failure. Life\r\nand success came from expression and experience. I am friendly with\r\nyou because we must part. Good-bye; Bishop.\"\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand, but the schismatist, pale and unable to more\r\nthan move mechanically, stared at him without offering his hand. The\r\nnuncio laughed again, and carelessly said, \"Oh, as you please.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they were in a shady place, secure from observation\r\nby a clump of trees, and the other soldier approached with a couple\r\nof shovels.\r\n\r\n\"Scoop out a grave there, fellows,\" said the Jesuit. \"You must not\r\ntake your prisoners to headquarters if you would avoid trouble. We\r\nwill have a bit of fun by and by.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were sufficiently drunk to be irresponsible, and of a\r\ntemperament to receive suggestions. They obeyed the Jesuit without\r\ndemurring, while he taunted the renegade Romish priest, and then they\r\ncame to him to inform him that all was ready.\r\n\r\n\"Tie the prisoner,\" said the Jesuit.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to pinion his legs and arms, and when this was done\r\nthe Jesuit continued:\r\n\r\n\"Now take him and throw him in the trench.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dios Mio! You surely will not bury me alive,\" plead the leader of the\r\nschism, as they lifted him and deposited him in the rude and shallow\r\ngrave. For answer the Jesuit bade the soldiers seize the shovels and\r\nfill up the sand over the body, leaving the head uncovered. Aglipay\r\nbegged and prayed, as shovelful after shovelful of sand fell upon\r\nhim, first rendering him powerless to move, and then bearing upon him\r\nwith a weight intolerable. His face was blanched, his eyes stood out,\r\nbloodshot in horror. For answer to his pleading the Jesuit produced\r\na prayer book and began to read in mockery the service of the dead:\r\n\r\n\"From the pains of death, good Lord, deliver me.\" Aglipay gritted\r\nhis teeth, but his soul responded in a sincerer prayer than the\r\nJesuit uttered.\r\n\r\n\"From the pains of hell and the agony of the grave\"--\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, deliver me,\" plead the man in the grave.\r\n\r\n\"Silence the disturber of our devotions,\" commanded the Jesuit.\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers lifted a shovelful of sand and threw it in the\r\nface of the man man in the grave. Some grains entered his eyes, but\r\nas he lay in agony, because gravel filled his mouth, he could only\r\ngroan and sputter without speaking.\r\n\r\n\"His mouth shall be filled with gravel,\" quoted the Jesuit, with\r\nunfeeling sarcasm. \"Fill in the grave, men.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers shoveled for a moment and the remains of Aglipay were\r\nburied from sight, literally buried alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n\"HE AIN'T NO FRIEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the death of Aglipay became noised abroad. Indeed,\r\nthe Jesuit took no pains to keep it from being known, because he\r\nfelt that the death of the leader would have an important effect in\r\nending the schism. The death was a matter susceptible of proof from\r\nthe fact that the body was found, but that he was buried alive could\r\nnot be proven save from the participants in the tragedy, who were\r\nnot required to testify against themselves. Rumors as to the horrors\r\nof the fate of Dr. Obispo Maximo spread through Manila and Luzon,\r\nand aroused the people to a high pitch of indignation. In a sense,\r\nit was for the time beneficial to the revolt, because hundreds now\r\nflocked to Saguanaldo, bringing their own weapons and ammunition, and\r\nevery region through which he passed was eager to feed the soldiery,\r\nso that opposition to the friars gained strong headway again. It became\r\nimpossible for the Americans to ignore the matter. In order to appease\r\nthe inhabitants of Manila, the three soldiers were arrested and placed\r\non trial, before a court martial, for killing a prisoner. They were\r\nfound guilty and ordered shot.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Violeta appeared before Judge Daft.\r\n\r\n\"You must pardon these men,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Must is a strong word,\" returned the Judge, flushing.\r\n\r\n\"The reasons behind it are strong,\" continued the Jesuit. \"The\r\ndeed they did, while irregular, has simplified matters amazingly,\r\nby removing the head and cause of the schism, so that they did you\r\nan inestimable service. You can not afford to show ingratitude toward\r\nwhat they did.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Manslaughter, perhaps. America is at war, not only with Spain,\r\nbut also with this schisms, and all war is manslaughter. Rainey's\r\nvictory was manslaughter. Manslaughter among soldiers is not a crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me you assume a great deal in saying that we are at war\r\nwith this schism.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be, which is the same thing. The Aglipayans over all the\r\narchipelago are in arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and this deed precipitated it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precipitated it, perhaps; that does not mean that was the cause of\r\nthe revolt. It was bound to come anyhow, and the sooner it comes the\r\ncheaper it will be for America; the quicker you win, the greater your\r\nreputation will be. The United States could not occupy the archipelago\r\nand leave the Philippine republic intact, you know that.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Daft thought in silence, pacing the floor. Then, seating himself\r\nat his desk, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Commander of American Forces:\r\n\r\n    \"Sir: Manslaughter in war is not a crime, though, if irregular,\r\n    may be an offense. You will place the slayers of Aglipay in the\r\n    guard house until you judge they have learned the lesson and until\r\n    discipline is conserved, then release them for service.--Benjamin\r\n    Daft, Governor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNews of this transaction did not set well with the people of\r\nManila. There was an old song sung in the island, and that night\r\nclumps of stragglers paraded the streets, noisily singing to that\r\ntune the improvised words:\r\n\r\n\r\n            He may be a brother of Governor Daft,\r\n            But he ain't no friend of mine. [18]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen news of the death of Aglipay reached her, near Manila, Hilario\r\nAgonoy was awakened to sufficient interest to plan something for\r\nherself. She straightway thought that if she could appear before\r\nJudge Daft and plead against the Jesuit, even going so far as to\r\nsacrifice herself by telling the whole story of Ambrosia Lonzello,\r\nshe might change the attitude of the United States and thus save the\r\nday for the insurrectionists.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days, therefore, Hilario Agonoy disappeared. Ambrosia\r\nLonzello again appeared before her mother at the grass hut--her mother,\r\nwho has mourned the mysterious disappearance of Ambrosia--and made\r\nherself known--telling the terrible story without concealment. The\r\nmother was stricken with horror, and convinced her daughter that\r\nshe was in no way culpable. Woman's garments were again donned and\r\nAmbrosia Lonzello prepared to appear, with her mother's consent,\r\nbefore Governor Daft to tell her story.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat discouraging to Ambrosia to find the Governor's\r\nheadquarters in the convento, and to be compelled to again visit the\r\nscene of her agony and ruin. But she nerved herself for the ordeal. It\r\nwas her fortune to be admitted to Judge Daft's office, to find the\r\nJesuit with him. To her it was a surprise and shock. But perhaps it\r\nwas as well. Had he been there, had he seen her before she reached\r\nthe governor, she might have been locked up again, both to safeguard\r\nhimself and satisfy anew his lust. And, after the first shock of it\r\nhad passed, the sight of her despoiler revived all the strength within\r\nher into anger and hatred, rendering her doubly powerful. Judge Daft\r\nkindly asked:\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear me,\" replied the girl, trembling from the intensity of her\r\nfeeling. \"I come to ask for justice. That man (pointing to the Jesuit)\r\nhas wronged me. I came to the church to confess, and he by force took\r\nme to the convento, where he locked and kept me all night, using me\r\nas I can not tell, and making me, who trusted him as a man of God,\r\nan outcast by his devil-deeds. I come to call justice and God's\r\nvengeance upon him. But this is not all. He it is who persuaded\r\ndrunken soldiers to bury Bishop Aglipay alive--alive, mind you;\r\nand as the poor man stifled in the sand, this fiend who poses as a\r\nrepresentative of God, mocked him by saying the burial service over\r\nhim. I come to call God's vengeance on him, and to ask for justice,\r\nfrom you toward this enemy of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was half hysterical, speaking in loud, impassioned\r\ntones. Judge Daft sought to quiet her.\r\n\r\n\"Be seated, my dear young lady,\" he said. \"These are grave charges\r\nyou make, and I shall look into them. But be calm, I fear in your\r\nexcitement you are exaggerating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exaggerating! I could not if I had a thousand tongues, all eloquent,\r\ntell half the wrongs I feel. I could not, even though educated as\r\nyou are and as he is, reveal a tenth of what I have suffered at\r\nhis hands. I beg of you, for humanity's sake, for the sake of your\r\ndaughter, if you have one, hear me and give me vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees before Judge Daft, who gently lifted her and\r\nsat her in the chair. The Jesuit stood smiling and serene. The girl,\r\nscarce knowing what she did, arose and screamed:\r\n\r\n\"You will not aid me. It is because you are as wax in the hands of\r\nthat devil, who by the hope of power and position for yourself moulds\r\nyou to his will. He induced you to pardon the murderers of Aglipay. He\r\npersuaded you to have the army seize on our churches. He has you in\r\nhis house, directing you by flattery and making you a tyrant from\r\nyour very kindness. My curses on you both! How hard and bitter this\r\nfierce world can be! It was my father, my own father, Judge Daft,\r\nwho delivered his daughter to this fiend. And this man, my father,\r\nBishop Lonzello, betrayed my mother when she was young, so that I\r\ncame into the world foredoomed to ruin and disgrace. And you, you,\r\nJudge Daft, uphold this Jesuit in his villainy and plots and will\r\nnot hear my prayer.\"\r\n\r\nThe over-wrought girl sank in a heap on the floor, sobbing\r\nbitterly. The noise of her last speech had brought several servants\r\non the scene. To them Judge Daft turned and compassionately said:\r\n\r\n\"Take her to a room, where she may rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! A room in this convento?\" screamed the girl arising. \"Back to\r\nthe scene of horror? I did not think this of you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was now attacking the servants with nails and fists, pressing\r\nher way toward the door. She fought her way to the street, and then\r\nran at her fullest speed, away, anywhere, but away from the convento.\r\n\r\n\"Poor creature!\" cried the Jesuit in tones of the deepest\r\ncommiseration. \"I think there is nothing in all the world sadder than\r\nthe hallucinations of the insane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n\"WHEN DO YOU THINK OF LEAVING?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was a most fortunate turn of affairs that led her to the extremes\r\nshe went,\" said the Jesuit, in reporting Ambrosia's visit to her\r\nfather. \"Had she stopped short of where she did, an investigation\r\nwould have been ordered, I feel sure of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it had been,\" commented Lonzello. \"You deserve punishment\r\nfor the wrong you did her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be unreasonable,\" gently expostulated the Jesuit. \"Her\r\naccusation was against you also, and the same drag net that caught\r\nme would have caught you, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe passionate Lonzello walked the floor nervously, cursing under\r\nhis breath.\r\n\r\n\"When do you think of leaving?\" persisted the Jesuit, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"When you leave, beast,\" hissed the priest.\r\n\r\n\"No, you will have to leave soon. The people demand it, and your\r\nsuccessor is in the harbor. But I have other work to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mob will have you, too,\" returned the bishop.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. I am under the protection of my good humor, but you have no\r\nsuch guardian. Have you much money?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I haven't anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to know how you can get away full-handed, feared and\r\nhonored by all?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will tell you. That daughter of yours will tell her story\r\nthrough town and she will be believed by hundreds there. The way to\r\nsilence these rumors, and to turn the tide toward us is to perform\r\na miracle.\"\r\n\r\n\"A miracle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, think of the honor of being Saint Lonzello, the miracle worker,\r\nand having hundreds come to your shrine seeking the efficacy of your\r\nsanctimonious bones! You may go from the archipelago honored and rich\r\nand feared, or you may go from the end of a rope. Which shall it be?\"\r\n\r\nThe two men drew chairs close together and talked earnestly in\r\nlow tones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA throng of the devout were gathered in Manila cathedral. To a pillar\r\nnear the pulpit Ambrosia Lonzello was chained. Neither she or the\r\naudience knew, but wires connecting with the chains ran under the floor\r\nto the pulpit, connecting them with a key on the floor. Underneath\r\nit all was a powerful battery. It had all been arranged secretly, at\r\nnight, by the Jesuit, who was himself an expert electrician. Bishop\r\nLonzello occupied the pulpit.\r\n\r\n\"We have come to the test by ordeal,\" he told the people. \"It grieves\r\nme that any one of the flock should have gone astray, but when the one\r\nwho leaves the true fold is my own daughter I am doubly grieved. And,\r\nas though it were not enough that she should desert the true church and\r\nbecome a friend and companion of the enemy of the church and state,\r\nshe brings accusation against the priests of the Lord, against her\r\nown father, and the apostolic nuncio. You have heard these charges,\r\nfor the unbelievers in the city take pleasure in rolling the scandal\r\nunder their tongues. It is beneath my dignity to deny, it is beneath\r\nthe dignity of the Pope's messenger to deny, such preposterous\r\nthings. We will call on the Almighty to decide between us. But first,\r\nmy daughter, let me beg of you, before we reach this supreme test,\r\nrecant and save yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the girl, who was chained to the stake. There were\r\ntears in his eyes, and feeling was in his voice. It was evident he\r\nsincerely hoped she would clear the situation by recanting.\r\n\r\n\"Ambrosia, save your father,\" he plead. \"Say I did not do the awful\r\nthing you charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"A father should not ask his daughter to perjure herself in the house\r\nof the Lord. This is nearly as wicked as to send me to confession\r\nin order I might in that holy place be made the victim of another's\r\nlust. Priest--for you have been so unfatherly, I will not call you\r\nfather--you are guilty, and you know it.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the people arose and stood, eager to catch each word. Now\r\nthat she was through they caught their breaths with a gasp that was\r\naudible through all the edifice. The face of the man in the pulpit grew\r\nwhite as his own surplice. His nails dug into the wood of the pulpit.\r\n\r\n\"Apply the test,\" said the Jesuit, arising and standing by the\r\nother. Lonzello assayed to speak, but he could not articulate.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we call on God to decide between us?\" asked the Jesuit of\r\nthe congregation.\r\n\r\n\"The test, the test,\" came from over all the house. Lonzello's face\r\ngrew haggard. Many of the congregation were surprised to see the man\r\nbefore them was old, with face deeply wrinkled. But the Jesuit was\r\nplacid, fully in command of himself and of the situation. He raised\r\nhis hands toward heaven, and remained silent until the people grew\r\ntense, waiting for what might come.\r\n\r\n\"Thou who didst destroy the guilty Jannes and Jambres in the\r\nwilderness,\" he began impressively, \"thou who didst reveal of old the\r\nstealer of the golden wedge, judge now, oh, God, the truth between\r\nus here. If thy servants are guilty of the things charged against us\"--\r\n\r\nHe paused, not only that he might the more impress the people, but\r\nalso to place one arm about Lonzello that he might support him in\r\ncase his nerve should fail him and his limbs grow weak; then, with\r\nthe other hand spread upward, he continued, impressively:\r\n\r\n\"Strike us dead, oh, God, cause us to die at once.\"\r\n\r\nEvery person in the house was standing; every neck was craned; every\r\nsound, even to the rustle of breathing, was stilled. A moment passed\r\nin tense silence. Then the low voice of the Jesuit continued:\r\n\r\n\"The Almighty has spoken. We live.\"\r\n\r\nThe people breathed again, audibly. Lonzello, his strength partly\r\nreturned and his anxiety burning into his very bones, rushed from\r\nthe pulpit to the post where his daughter was chained, and, falling\r\non his knees, begged piteously:\r\n\r\n\"Confess, confess, Ambrosia, and end this horrible thing. The father\r\nis on his knees to the daughter, begging you to recant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confess!\" cried the girl with scorn. \"That is the word you used to\r\nsend me to slaughter, to be devoured by that beast. Sweet father,\r\nyou are, to ask a daughter to swear to a lie in order to shield the\r\nman who wronged her. I know not what foul plot you have framed here,\r\nbut I do know in my soul of souls I am as white as dawn and that\r\nyour soul is black as night from which the dawn is born. As for that\r\ncreature in the robes of God, neighbors and friends, I say he is a\r\ndevil. His place is hell--however, not to rule, but to find torment,\r\nnow and everlasting.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit flushed slightly, but his voice was unruffled as he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Friends, shall we call the test of God on her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" Lonzello plead, rushing back to the pulpit, \"not on her.\"\r\n\r\n\"A father may be pitied in pleading for a child,\" the Jesuit said,\r\nquietly and without passion. \"I would, if I could, spare him, and\r\nher as well. Let me, for his sake, girl, ask you to speak the word\r\nthat shall save both. Recant, recant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Repent, repent,\" returned Ambrosia, facing him fiercely. \"The crime\r\nis on your head; the crime on me, the crime upon my father, the crime\r\nwhich now I feel you mean to do, are all upon your head. Repent,\r\nrepent.\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl is obdurate,\" said the Jesuit, turning again to the\r\npeople. \"In spite of vindication heaven sent, she has reiterated\r\naccusations. Therefore, we shall be forced to call on heaven again\r\nto choose between us. Shall we do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"The test, the test!\" cried the people in one voice.\r\n\r\nAgain the right hand of the Jesuit was raised, again the left stole\r\nround Lonzello, gripping him as with a vice. His toe sought the hidden\r\nkey under the pulpit as he intoned:\r\n\r\n\"Choose now between us, which of us is right. If we are guilty, send\r\nfrom heaven the fires and take our lives. If we have been maligned,\r\nthen let the fiery vengeance seize on the woman who has said the word\r\nand prove to all the people that thou art a jealous God, watching\r\nabove thine own.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, even as his hand was outstretched to heaven,\r\nAmbrosia Lonzello straightened, then lunged forward, her hands and\r\nlimbs trembling and shaking; again and again, as the friar's toe\r\nmoved, the horrible contortions were repeated. As he completed his\r\nprayer the girl hung limp and heavy on her chains, lifeless.\r\n\r\nAn instant more the audience was in a turmoil.\r\n\r\n\"A miracle, a miracle!\" it cried.\r\n\r\nMen and women rushed to the altar, crowding and kneeling, fumbling\r\ntheir rosaries and praying. Lonzello sank into the chair at the side\r\nof the altar. The Jesuit alone was calm and commanding.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"it is a miracle. The Lord has spoken. Strip your\r\nfingers and ears and pockets of jewelry and money, and lay it before\r\nhim who doeth wonders in your sight. Woe to the man or woman who\r\nrefuses, woe upon the head of such!\"\r\n\r\nMen were groaning, women praying aloud. Money and jewelry were thrown\r\nbefore the altar in profusion, until hundreds of dollars in value\r\nwere piled there. Then the audience was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the Jesuit, turning to Lonzello, \"take this stuff and\r\nget from the country at once. Your successor from America has arrived\r\nand is in the harbor even now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n\"THE INSURRECTION IS OVER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Saguanaldo heard of the fate that had befallen Ambrosia he\r\nwas almost beside himself with rage and horror. He determined to be\r\nrevenged on the Jesuit and Lonzello, and issued orders for the force to\r\nat once prepare for active service. Mrs. Rizal's singing and speaking\r\nbegan to bear fruit. The story of Ambrosia spread rapidly through\r\nthe island, rousing the people to something like frenzy. They came\r\nout in force. Not until now had that feeling which makes a religious\r\nwar been stirred, but it was rampant at this time. Even some of the\r\nSpanish friars, who rebelled at being banished from the islands,\r\njoined the revolt. The war had turned, so that it was no longer\r\nSpaniard and native, but the native against both Spain and America.\r\n\r\nThey gathered in great numbers before Manila, coming in pairs and\r\nsquads. Some were captured, but the United States troops, appalled at\r\nthe demonstration that seemed to be even larger than it really was,\r\nfell back into the city, while the insurgents formed on the hills\r\noccupying the rifle pits without. It was raining and the mud was so\r\ndeep that all movements were slow and disagreeable. But the forboding\r\nappearance of nature did not discourage the malcontents. Women and\r\nchildren were there. Some of them were unarmed, but they gathered\r\nstones for throwing and carried them. Others had nothing but clubs\r\nor bolos. But they were all mad for slaughter, ready to die.\r\n\r\nContrary to expectations of the Americans, they did not attack by\r\nnight. Neither did they make any demonstration against the Spanish\r\nfortress of Cavite. In the early morning women and children, ragged\r\nand showing the poverty that had provoked the war, drenched by rain,\r\nmuddy and miserable, marched down the streets, in irregular lines,\r\nshrieking and singing. As they marched, others came from the houses\r\nof Manila and joined them. Again there was the song:\r\n\r\n\r\n            He may be a brother of Governor Daft,\r\n            But he ain't no friend of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of an army, it was a mob, something far harder to handle than\r\nan army, especially if it is composed of women and children. They\r\nbroke into shops and took things to eat, munching and screaming as\r\nthey marched.\r\n\r\nThen, while the American troops were besieged with the mob, Saguanaldo\r\nattacked from the rear. As his troops charged on the American works,\r\nwomen from the rear threw stones at the American soldiers. The first\r\nline of defense was taken. Cavite was silent, having no part in this\r\nbattle, and it was well for America it was so; for had the attack\r\nbeen more complicated, the issue might have been in doubt. Some said\r\nit had been arranged so in advance. As it was, the American army\r\nlay in the mud in its redoubts, with the rain drizzling on them,\r\nand the little pools of water that formed were stained with blood.\r\n\r\nSomehow Saguanaldo and an aide penetrated to the convento and appeared\r\nunannounced before Judge Daft, dripping from the rain and sprinkled\r\nwith mud.\r\n\r\n\"Have a seat, General,\" said Judge Daft, affably. \"You must be very\r\ncold. I will order hot coffee brought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, but you need not,\" Saguanaldo replied. \"I am here on a\r\nmission of war, not of hospitality. You have wronged me, Governor,\r\ngrievously wronged me.\"\r\n\r\n\"War is not a pink tea affair,\" returned the Judge. \"It can not be\r\nprosecuted without individual harm being done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not refer to that,\" said the insurgent. \"I shall not whimper\r\nover hardships and private losses or wounds that come from war. But\r\nyou have wounded me in peace, while I was ally to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see that you are acting as an ally today.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I was when I went with the American troops to spy out and\r\ndefeat the Spaniards. And at the very hour when I was serving you,\r\nand after I had voluntarily given you my office and surrendered the\r\nPhilippine republic that we might come under the protection of the\r\nAmerican republic, you set your soldiers to protecting the Spanish\r\nfriars, in possession of property which Spanish soldiers had seized\r\nfrom us. Was that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a general order. Had the insurgents been in possession of the\r\nproperty, they would have been protected in it. It is not my fault\r\nif you were not able to hold this property.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you occupy the conventos, on invitation of the friars. It puts\r\nyou under obligation to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I occupied the house you offered. Did that put me under obligation\r\nto you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But you now war those who were your allies.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you war those who were your allies. That makes us even.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man whose guest you are, murdered the leader of the schism,\r\ncruelly, and you shield him. He betrayed the faith of the friar's\r\ndaughter\"--\r\n\r\n\"After she had betrayed her faith\"--\r\n\r\n\"On her father's solicitation\"--\r\n\r\n\"So she said. Poor girl, she was evidently insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then horribly maltreated her. Later he burned her, as it were,\r\nat the stake.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Judge Daft, amiably, \"it is not a part of my duty\r\nto quarrel, and I refuse to jower longer with you. If you want to\r\nfight, go and join with those whose duty it is to fight. If you\r\nhave a personal grievance, bring civil suit, and I will hear your\r\ncause. Before you go, I shall be pleased if you will permit me to\r\nserve you something warm.\"\r\n\r\nSaguanaldo was broken in spirit. He was again beaten in diplomacy. His\r\nmission had failed, and, with quivering lip and voice shaking with\r\nemotion, he said farewell, muffled himself in his great coat and took\r\nhis departure with his aide.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped on the street he was met by a detachment of soldiers,\r\nsent out from the convento by the apostolic nuncio, and placed under\r\narrest. At the same time Violeta stepped before him and extended\r\nhis hand:\r\n\r\n\"General, I am glad to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nSaguanaldo struck at him, but missed, because the soldiers restrained\r\nhim. The Jesuit very composedly said:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is ever made, General, by being unpleasant. Take the prisoner\r\nto American headquarters, and spread the report that the leader is\r\ncaptured and the insurrection is over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT\r\n\r\n\"Diaz, the Dictator\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn thanking all who by their advance subscriptions made possible\r\nthe publication of \"The Friar's Daughter,\" I wish to announce the\r\npreparation of another book, entitled \"Diaz the Dictator.\" It will\r\nbe somewhat longer than this work, and will be even more dramatic,\r\nfuller of action and intrigue, and will bring events practically to\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nThe real story of Diaz has never been written understandingly. Why\r\nand how he became a dictator; how the masses of the people of Mexico\r\nwere made peons; the motives behind his action; the development of\r\ncapitalism and the fall of feudalism in Mexico, have not yet been\r\ntouched on understandingly. They are told in the fascinating story\r\nwhich I announce. The near relationship of the United States to Mexico\r\nthrough it all is made clear.\r\n\r\nNot many know that the French government, at the instance of the\r\nRoman hierarchy, after the confiscation of the church lands in Mexico,\r\noverthrew the republic in 1863, and established as a form of government\r\n\"a temperate and hereditary Catholic monarchy.\" Not many know that\r\nJaurez, the Mexican president who was forced from his position by a\r\nforeign army, appealed to the United States for aid, but that this\r\ncountry, being in the midst of a big war, was unable to lend him\r\nsuccor. Not many know that just as soon as there was prospect of the\r\nAmerican armies being released from war, congress, on April 4th, 1864,\r\nwarned France that America would not, under the Monroe doctrine, permit\r\nan European power to establish a monarchy on American soil. Not many\r\nknow that on February 9th, 1869, Abraham Lincoln issued an ultimatum\r\nto France that she must either withdraw her troops from Mexico or\r\nfight the United States--that France withdrew, and the monarchy\r\nwent to pieces. Not many have thought that the plotting against\r\nLincoln's life, by Catholics exclusively, began on March 6th, 1865,\r\nand culminated on April 15th, 1865. All this time Diaz was fighting\r\nwith the Mexican patriots. Do you know what caused him to change?\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the things brought out in the work. If\r\n\"The Friar's Daughter\" is an eye-opener, then \"Diaz the Dictator\"\r\nwill prove the thunder clap.\r\n\r\nWill you help to bring out this work, as you so generously helped with\r\n\"The Friar's Daughter\"? If so, I ask you to fill out the enclosed\r\nblank and mail it to me, WITHOUT SENDING MONEY. The prices will be\r\nthe same as with this work:\r\n\r\nTen copies, $3.00; 100 copies, $22.00; single copy, 40 cents.\r\n\r\nEnclose in envelope and mail to me, and when the subscription reaches\r\n1,000 work will be begun on printing \"Diaz the Dictator.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           C.
