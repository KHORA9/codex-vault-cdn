B._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago a literary investigator came into my office and inquired\r\nwhether he could find a copy of Richard Tickell’s _Anticipation_ in\r\nour library. He was thinking of sending to the British Museum for a\r\nphotostatic copy, in case we could not supply his need. We were able to\r\nreply that we had sixteen editions of this book—ten of them printed in\r\nthe year 1778 alone. Now publishers do not re-issue a book unless someone\r\nis reading it. The number of reprints induced me to read the book, and I\r\nfound it one of the best of eighteenth-century satires on the ponderous\r\nserio-comic addresses delivered in what is still pleased to call itself\r\nthe M-th-r of P-rl—m-nts. Though Mr. Butterfield has restrained himself\r\nin the matter of drawing parallels between the bumbling follies of that\r\nlegislative conclave, then and now, yet the writer of a foreword may be\r\npermitted to do so.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1941, I received in the mail a pamphlet, in an envelope\r\nwhich bore a Chinese postage stamp and the postmark of Shanghai. The\r\npamphlet was one of the familiar blue-covered fascicles which we all\r\nrecognize as the format of the _Parliamentary Debates_. This particular\r\nfascicle purported to contain the debate for August 15, 1941, and was\r\ntypographically exact, even to the reproduction of the arms of H-s\r\nBr-t-nn-c M-j-sty on the cover. An examination revealed it to be the\r\ntwentieth-century parallel of Tickell’s _Anticipation_—a satiric report\r\nof the debates in the H—s- of C-mm-ns as of 1941. It was obvious German\r\npropaganda, but so well done typographically that I found some of my\r\nlearned colleagues had read a part of it before it dawned on them that\r\nthe whole thing was analogous to Tickell’s _Anticipation_. But let no\r\nAmerican be complacent about the failure of the H—s- of C-mm-ns to\r\nprogress during the intervening one hundred and sixty-three years. Let\r\nhim dip into our own _C-ngr-ss—n-l R-c-rd_.\r\n\r\nMr. Butterfield and the publisher could have chosen no more appropriate\r\ntime than the present at which to issue the twentieth-century edition\r\nof this book. It ought to be read by all students of American\r\nhistory—elementary and advanced.\r\n\r\n                                                        RANDOLPH G. ADAMS\r\n\r\n    The W. L. Clements Library\r\n    Ann Arbor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first reprint since 1822 of a politico-literary satire that\r\ndelighted a generation of readers during and after the American War of\r\nIndependence. It has seemed to the editor, and to others who encouraged\r\nthe project, that the neglect of _Anticipation_ has been due less to its\r\nwant of interest than to the want of a properly edited reprint. The mere\r\npresence in it of so many names with deleted letters has discouraged\r\nlater readers.[1] The present volume provides an account of the author\r\nand of the setting and reception of _Anticipation_, an accurate text,\r\nexplanatory notes, and a bibliography of Tickell’s writings.\r\n\r\n_Anticipation_ was written and printed hastily; and the spelling\r\n(especially of proper names), the punctuation, and sometimes even the\r\ngrammar are erratic. But since it has proved impossible to distinguish\r\nthe carelessness of the printer from that of the author, I have followed\r\nthe first issue literally except when corrections were available in the\r\nfollowing later ones: “The Third Edition, Corrected,” which appeared\r\nwithin a week of first publication; “The Tenth Edition, Corrected,” 1780,\r\nwhich was the last published during Tickell’s life; and “A New Edition,\r\nCorrected,” 1794, a re-issue occasioned, probably, by Tickell’s death and\r\nset from new type. Two or three flagrant errors (e.g., the name “Bonille”\r\nfor “Bouillé” at p. 59) and a few typographical absurdities (such as\r\nquotation marks without mates) recur in all the London issues. These I\r\nhave corrected without warrant from any text.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that in the Introduction I have usually not cited\r\nsources for dates and other biographical details when the sources are\r\ncorrectly given in W. Fraser Rae’s article on Tickell in _The Dictionary\r\nof National Biography_. Unless otherwise indicated, the place of\r\npublication of all works cited is London.\r\n\r\nA great many friends have contributed to the making of this book, and\r\nalmost as many librarians in the United States and England have aided my\r\nresearches for it. Some special debts I wish to record here. Randolph G.\r\nAdams, Director of the William L. Clements Library at Ann Arbor, Julian\r\nP. Boyd, Librarian of Princeton University, and Professor George Sherburn\r\nof Harvard have read my manuscript and given me helpful advice. W. S.\r\nLewis, Esq., of Farmington, Connecticut, kindly allowed me to quote\r\nfrom notes written by Horace Walpole in a copy of _Anticipation_ now in\r\nMr. Lewis’ collection of Walpoliana; Richard Eustace Tickell, Esq., of\r\nLondon, sent me useful material from the Tickell family papers; Mrs.\r\nFlora V. Livingston and Mr. William Van Lennep, curators, respectively,\r\nof the Widener Collection and the Theatre Collection in the Harvard\r\nCollege Library, allowed me to quote from manuscript letters in their\r\ncharge; the New York Public Library gave me permission to reproduce the\r\ntitle-page that precedes the text. For aid in preparing the Bibliography\r\nof Tickell’s Writings I am most indebted to Mr. John D. Gordan of the New\r\nYork Public Library, who read and ably criticized it; to Miss Anne S.\r\nPratt of the Yale University Library, and Mr. Frederick R. Goff of the\r\nLibrary of Congress, who answered numerous bibliographical inquiries;\r\nto the Union Catalog in the Library of Congress and its staff; and to\r\nthe admirable _Bibliotheca Americana_, begun by Joseph Sabin, continued\r\nby Wilberforce Eames, and then completed by R. W. G. Vail, New York,\r\n1868-1937. The services of Herbert B. Anstaett, Librarian of Franklin and\r\nMarshall College, have been so various, constant, and indispensable that\r\nthey deserve my most sincere thanks. No thanks, however, can be adequate\r\nfor the devoted work and interest bestowed on the preparation of this\r\nbook, from beginning to end, by my wife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am grateful also to the following publishers for permission to quote\r\nfrom the books named: The Clarendon Press, Oxford, for _Boswell’s Life of\r\nJohnson_ edited by George Birkbeck Hill, revised and enlarged edition\r\nby L.

Originally the use of blanks and asterisks in names of persons\r\nwas a means of avoiding libel actions. One should never print a man’s\r\nname out at length, said Swift in _The Importance of the Guardian\r\nConsidered_, 1713; “but, as I do, that of Mr. St—le: so that, although\r\neverybody alive knows whom I mean, the plaintiff can have no redress\r\nin any court of justice.” This was such an easy way to add piquancy to\r\ndefamation that it became conventional in satire. In 1778 the reviewer of\r\nan anti-ministerial poem called _The Conquerors_ observed that the work\r\nseemed “designed for the perusal of astronomers; there are more _stars_\r\nin it than the galaxy contains” (_The Critical Review_, XLV, 150).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          PAGE\r\n\r\n    FOREWORD _by Randolph G.

Poets and ingenious men, who write on\r\n    occasional subjects with great ability, are too often lost\r\n    in the most undeserved oblivion. But we must recollect, that\r\n    even such a poem as “The Absalom and Achitophel” of Dryden\r\n    himself (perhaps his greatest production) was but _occasional_,\r\n    and written _for a party_.⸺_The Pursuits of Literature_, 5th\r\n    edition, 1798\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n_1_\r\n\r\nEarly in 1778 a new satirical poet caused a flutter in the polite circles\r\nof London. Within a few weeks of one another two poems, _The Project_\r\nand _The Wreath of Fashion_, were issued by Becket, the bookseller of\r\nthe Adelphi in the Strand. Though anonymous, their author was soon known\r\nto be a young barrister named Richard Tickell. _The Project_ treats of\r\na scheme overlooked by the Academy of Projectors which Captain Gulliver\r\nvisited in the course of his third voyage. In deft octosyllabics the\r\nsatirist proposes applying Montesquieu’s discovery of the effect of\r\nclimate on character to the problem of the parliamentary Opposition:\r\n\r\n      Suppose the Turks, who now agree\r\n    It wou’d _fatigue_ them to be free,\r\n    Should build an ice-house, to debate\r\n    More _cooly_ on affairs of state,\r\n    Might not some Mussulmen be brought,\r\n    To brace their minds, nor shrink at thought?\r\n\r\nSurely the philosophers are right who have reasoned that England’s\r\nnorthern air is accountable for Englishmen’s love of liberty, and many\r\na question has been lost by Administration from Parliament’s meeting in\r\ncold weather. An obvious solution would be to alter the season of meeting:\r\n\r\n    But ah, what honest squire would stay\r\n    To make his _speech_, instead of _hay_?\r\n    The _Beaux_ would scarcely think of law,\r\n    To give up _Scarborough_ or _Spa’_:\r\n    And say ye _sportsmen_, wou’d a member\r\n    Attend _St. Stephen’s_ in September?\r\n\r\nThe poet’s more feasible plan is a better mode of heating the Parliament\r\nbuildings. He suggests that in each House, replacing the table where\r\nvotes, journals, and mace are laid, a vast “_Buzaglo_”[1] be set up; that\r\nis, an open fire of intense heat, over which a Fire Committee should\r\npreside with a fuel supply of seditious tracts—_Junius_, _Common Sense_,\r\nand the works of Tucker and Price. Such a device will mollify the most\r\ninveterate foes of Administration:\r\n\r\n    From bench to bench, in spite of gout,\r\n    The soften’d _Chatham_ moves about:\r\n    “My good _Lord Sandwich_, how d’ye do?\r\n    I like the speech; ’twas penn’d by you.\r\n    America has gone too far;\r\n    We must support so just a war.”\r\n\r\nThe reviewers were delighted with the poem, so distinguished by its good\r\nnature and wit amid the current tide of party polemics. The connoisseur\r\nin Horace Walpole was stronger than his Whiggism, and he found _The\r\nProject_ excellent.[2] Dr. Johnson, who disapproved of flippancy in\r\npolitics, dissented. At a dinner party at Sir Joshua Reynolds’ on the\r\n25th of April, Dr. Samuel Musgrave, the learned editor of Euripides, read\r\nthe new poem. Johnson was not amused. “A temporary poem always entertains\r\nus,” urged Musgrave. “So,” replied Johnson, “does an account of the\r\ncriminals hanged yesterday entertain us.”[3]\r\n\r\nRather ungratefully, Tickell followed up his reception as a poet in the\r\ncircles of _ton_ with a satire on one of society’s most conspicuous\r\nfoibles. _The Wreath of Fashion, or, the Art of Sentimental Poetry_,\r\nsaid _The Critical Review_ in its notice, “is levelled at the same vice\r\nin the poetical world, at which the School for Scandal was aimed in\r\nthe theatrical and moral worlds,—at the present fashionable strain of\r\nsentimental whining.”[4] It was an age of rhyming peers. Tickell declared\r\nin the preface that he was prompted to write his satire by reading a\r\nrecent volume by a noble author (whom he did not name but who was the\r\nEarl of Carlisle, Byron’s “Lord, rhymester, petit-maître, pamphleteer”)\r\ncontaining one ode on the death of Mr. Gray and two on the death of his\r\nlordship’s spaniel. In _The Wreath of Fashion_ Tickell deplored, with\r\nSheridan, the vogue of tearful comedies and gently rebuked the inanities\r\nof newspaper poets. His chief ridicule was reserved for the poetic salon\r\nof Mrs. “Calliope” Miller at Batheaston, where the quality from Bath\r\nwrote _bouts-rimés_ about buttered muffins and the like, dropped them\r\ninto a classic vase, and applauded the winners crowned by Mrs. Miller\r\nwith wreaths of myrtle.[5] Over these rites of poetic sensibility,\r\nsaid the satirist, the goddess Fashion presides, and thus she must be\r\nsupplicated:\r\n\r\n      On a spruce pedestal of _Wedgwood ware_,\r\n    Where motley forms, and tawdry emblems glare,\r\n    Behold she consecrates to cold applause,\r\n    A Petrefaction, work’d into a _Vase_:\r\n    The Vase of Sentiment!—to this impart\r\n    Thy kindred coldness, and congenial art....\r\n    With votive song, and tributary verse,\r\n    Fashion’s gay train her gentle rites rehearse.\r\n    What soft poetic incense breathes around!\r\n    What soothing hymns from Adulation sound!\r\n\r\n_The Wreath of Fashion_ went through a half-dozen editions. David Garrick\r\nwrote a puff for it in _The Monthly Review_ in which he ventured to\r\nprophesy that “elegant poetry, refined satire, and exquisite irony” would\r\nbe revived by the new author;[6] and Samuel Rogers, belated Augustan that\r\nhe was, always remembered _The Wreath_ as an early favorite.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n_2_\r\n\r\nWho was the new poet? The turn of his couplets and the delicate barbs of\r\nhis satire suggested a poetic school then growing outmoded. There were\r\nthose who, when they learned his name, remembered his grandfather, Thomas\r\nTickell, a poet of Queen Anne’s day and the particular friend of Mr.\r\nAddison. Thomas Tickell (1685-1740) served as Addison’s Under-Secretary\r\nof State and retained his post under Craggs and Carteret. In 1724,\r\nwhen Carteret became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Tickell was sent to\r\nDublin as Secretary to the Lords Justices. There were cordial relations\r\nbetween Dublin Castle and the Deanery of St. Patrick’s, and a circle of\r\nfriends that included Swift, the Delanys, Lord Orrery, and Dr. Sheridan\r\nmaintained in Dublin an outpost of Augustan literary society. In this\r\npropitious atmosphere John Tickell, eldest son of Thomas and father of\r\nRichard, our poet, was born in 1729 and grew up to take his place among\r\nthe Dublin _virtuosi_. But he had a volatile character and fell into\r\na train of misadventures and difficulties. In 1748 he made a runaway\r\nmarriage with Esther (or Hester) Pierson, and children to the number of\r\nsix followed in rapid succession.[8] At length he became disastrously\r\ninvolved in Anglo-Irish politics while serving on the court side as a\r\nmagistrate after the Dublin riots in December 1759.[9] His conduct on\r\nthis occasion, though its precise nature is not clear, excited such\r\nindignation that he was obliged to leave Dublin. In 1765, according to\r\ninformation in the Tickell family papers, his mother purchased for him\r\na civil appointment at Windsor Castle; but some years later, like other\r\nindigent Englishmen at that period, he went to live on the Continent and\r\ndisappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nRichard, the second son of John Tickell, is usually said to have\r\nbeen born at Bath in 1751, but neither the place nor the date can be\r\nverified. He and his elder brother Thomas were briefly at Westminster\r\nSchool (from 19 June 1764); when their father went to Windsor Castle,\r\nthey were transferred to Eton (29 May 1765); three years later Richard\r\nproceeded to the Middle Temple (8 November 1768).[10] Having in due time\r\nbeen called to the bar, he was, about the beginning of 1777, appointed\r\nby Lord Chancellor Bathurst a commissioner of bankrupts. However, as a\r\ncontemporary biographer remarked, law was not to Tickell’s taste; “his\r\ndisposition was too volatile and desultory for that study.”[11] In April\r\nor May 1778 he was removed from his post. Doubtless his courtship of the\r\nmuses had been at the expense of the law, for his fellow-commissioners\r\nhad complained of his absences. Tickell turned in his distress to his\r\nmost influential friend, David Garrick, who at once interceded for him\r\nwith the Lord Chancellor, by way of Lady Bathurst.[12] Garrick obtained\r\nfrom Bathurst a promise of reinstatement, but in June Bathurst was\r\nsucceeded by Edward Thurlow, and Garrick had to begin all over again.\r\nHis further attempts met with no success. “I am sorry we were both so\r\nunsuccessful in our Schems with the present Chancellor,” Garrick was\r\ninformed by Lady Bathurst on the 25th of July; “I do assure you I did my\r\npart for Mʳ Tickle but I find he has enemies who flung cold water on my\r\nsolicitations.”[13] The news plunged Tickell into despair.\r\n\r\nBut Fortune is capricious, and at this moment Tickell made the\r\nacquaintance of one who was even closer than Garrick to the springs of\r\npatronage. This was William Brummell, whose only claim to remembrance\r\ntoday is the fact that he had a very famous son, but who appears in\r\nlate eighteenth-century memoirs as an able backstairs politician and\r\nprivate secretary to Lord North. Brummell, we are informed by the\r\n_Biographia Dramatica_, “conceived a strong friendship for our author,\r\nand patronised him with a generosity and warmth that did him honour.”[14]\r\nWith the approval and perhaps at the instigation of Lord North, Tickell\r\nwas at once set to work on a secret and important project. On the 7th of\r\nNovember he wrote Garrick pleading to be excused from writing a prologue\r\nthat had been requested of him:\r\n\r\n    You may be assured Mr. Garrick’s wishes shall always have the\r\n    force of commands with me; but when I acquaint you that at\r\n    present ... I am employed in a work that may make or mar my\r\n    fortune, I can scarcely think you would wish to interrupt my\r\n    attention to it.[15]\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 23rd of that month, three days before Parliament met for\r\nthe new session, Becket announced the publication of a work entitled\r\n“_ANTICIPATION_, Containing the Substance of his M⸻y’s most gracious\r\nSpeech to both H⸺s of P⸻t, on the Opening of the approaching Session.\r\nTogether with a full and authentic account of the Debate in the H⸺ of C⸻,\r\nthat will take place on the motion for the address and amendment.” On\r\nTuesday night Edward Gibbon wrote his friend Holroyd:\r\n\r\n    You sometimes complain that I do not send you early news;\r\n    but you will now be satisfied with receiving a full and true\r\n    account of all the parliamentary transactions of _next_\r\n    Thursday. In town we think it an excellent piece of humour\r\n    (the author is one Tickell). Burke and C. Fox are pleased with\r\n    their own Speaches, but serious Patriots groan that such things\r\n    should be turned to farce.[16]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, though unable to deny the wit of _Anticipation_, was\r\namong those who thought its jocularity ill-timed. Said he:\r\n\r\n    The drollery of the pamphlet was congenial with the patron: a\r\n    very unprosperous and disgraceful civil war, just heightened by\r\n    a bloody proclamation of Sir Henry Clinton, and accompanied by\r\n    a war with France, was not a very decent moment for joking![17]\r\n\r\n\r\n_3_\r\n\r\nNo one in any party was disposed to deny the seriousness of the moment.\r\nThe preceding twelve months, as some were then aware, had proved the\r\nturning-point in the war with America. The threat of French aggression\r\nfollowing Burgoyne’s defeat had transformed Britain’s war of subjugation\r\ninto one of defence. After a comfortable winter in Philadelphia, without\r\nhaving struck a blow at the inferior American forces at Valley Forge, Sir\r\nWilliam Howe was ordered to evacuate that city lest it be cut off by a\r\nFrench fleet. Englishmen at home could still cling to the official view,\r\nheld by George III and expressed by Lord North in _Anticipation_, that\r\nmost Americans, if given a chance to choose, would prefer conciliation\r\nwith England to an upstart democracy and an “unnatural connection” with\r\nFrance. But those on the spot saw that the hope of affording Americans\r\nsuch a chance was now dashed. At Philadelphia Admiral Lord Howe’s\r\nsecretary wrote in his journal on the 22nd of May:\r\n\r\n    I now look upon the Contest as at an End. No man can be\r\n    expected to declare for us, when he cannot be assured of a\r\n    Fortnight’s Protection. Every man, on the contrary, whatever\r\n    might have been his primary Inclinations, will find it his\r\n    Interest to oppose & drive us out of the Country.[18]\r\n\r\nTwo days later General Howe set sail for England and left Sir Henry\r\nClinton to evacuate the troops in June. The incompetence or treachery\r\nof an American officer, Charles Lee, saved Clinton’s regiments from\r\nsevere losses as they crossed New Jersey. After their arrival within\r\nthe fortifications around New York, the British held not a square mile\r\nelsewhere on the mainland of the northern and middle colonies.\r\n\r\nThe summer was occupied with raids by British irregulars on the\r\nPennsylvania and New York frontier and a series of inconclusive feints\r\nand chases between Admirals Howe and D’Estaing. In September Howe\r\nresigned his command and followed his brother home to England. Deeply\r\ndisgruntled with Administration, the Howes joined General Burgoyne in\r\nefforts to obtain satisfaction from Parliament. The Whigs, hoping for\r\ndisclosures embarrassing to the government, at once took up the cause of\r\nthe commanders; while the ministers, with equal determination, resisted\r\nevery move for a court-martial or inquiry.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the Tory government had been as hard pressed at home\r\nas the King’s forces had been abroad. The news of Saratoga, received\r\nearly in December 1777, struck a staggering blow to the ministers,\r\nwho at once adjourned Parliament for six weeks and endeavored to open\r\nindirect and secret negotiations with the American commissioners in\r\nParis. When Parliament reconvened, Fox’s motion in the Commons “that no\r\nmore of the Old Corps be sent out of the kingdom” produced a suddenly\r\nswollen minority. There was a cry throughout the country for Chatham.\r\nNorth had lost his zest for the war and would willingly have retired in\r\nfavor of Chatham, but the King refused to consider such a move. In a\r\ndesperate effort to counteract American negotiations with France, North\r\nthen introduced, 17 February 1778, his conciliatory bills, which offered\r\nthe repeal of the acts that had offended the colonists and conceded all\r\nbut the name of independence. While the House was recovering from its\r\namazement Charles Fox rose and said that he was glad Ministers had at\r\nlast concurred with the long-standing views of Opposition. But had not\r\ntheir repentance come too late? Did not Ministers know that a commercial\r\ntreaty between France and America had already been signed?[19] “Acts of\r\nParliament have made a war,” Walpole wrote Sir Horace Mann three days\r\nlater, “but cannot repeal one.”[20] On the 13th of March the French\r\nambassador in London announced the treaty of friendship between France\r\nand the United States. Thereafter no one in either party expected much\r\nof North’s commission to treat with America. Detained in England until\r\nmid-April, the commissioners arrived in the Delaware a whole month after\r\nCongress had ratified the treaty with France and, to their great chagrin,\r\njust in time to take part in the retreat from Philadelphia. One member\r\nof the commission, George Johnstone, after futile private overtures to\r\nmembers of Congress, quarreled with his colleagues and returned in a\r\nhuff to vindicate himself and criticize ministers and commanders before\r\nParliament. On the whole, the commission did little more than aggravate\r\nthe ill-feeling on both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April, after a long absence, Lord Chatham, wrapped in\r\nflannels and supported by his sons, took his seat in the House of Lords.\r\nRising for the second time in the debate to speak on the American war,\r\nhe was struck down by an apoplexy from which he never recovered. His\r\ndeath, on the 11th of May, was believed and said by many to be a portent\r\nof doom to the Empire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the specter of a French invasion caused the King late in March\r\nto communicate to Parliament his intention of ordering the militia “to\r\nbe drawn out and embodied, and to march as occasion shall require.” Five\r\nencampments were established; peers and M.P.’s, Whig and Tory alike,\r\nhastened to raise regiments; and by June Gibbon could tell Holroyd that\r\n“The chief conversation at Almack’s is about tents, drill-Serjeants,\r\nsubdivisions, firings, &c.”[21] All summer and autumn the country was\r\nfull of marching and countermarching for the edification of anxious\r\nroyalty. In the newspapers appeared advertisements for “martial balsam,”\r\nrecommended for those afflicted by toothache from exposure to damp\r\ncanvas and mattresses. Even theater business was depressed by the rage\r\nfor visiting the encampments. Sheridan, ever resourceful, dashed off as\r\na counter-attraction his entertainment of _The Camp_, with a musical\r\narrangement by Thomas Linley, a prologue by Tickell, and (according to\r\nthe newspaper notices) “a perspective Representation of the GRAND CAMP at\r\nCOXHEATH, from a view taken by Mr. de Loutherbourg and erected under his\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\nAll this was diverting, but in midsummer occurred an incident that\r\nbetrayed to the nation the smoldering antagonism between ministers and\r\ncommanders. In the previous March Admiral Keppel, a staunch Whig who had\r\nrefused to serve against America, had been promoted commander of the\r\nChannel fleet. He found, contrary to the Admiralty’s repeated assurances\r\nin Parliament, that ships and equipment were woefully inadequate for his\r\ncrucial task of defending the coasts. At length reinforced, Keppel on\r\nthe 27th of July engaged the Brest fleet off Ushant. In command of the\r\nBritish rearward squadron was Sir Hugh Palliser, a Tory M.P. and a Lord\r\nof the Admiralty. Following a short and indecisive action, Keppel gave\r\norders for a new line of battle, but Palliser did not obey until after\r\ndark. By morning the French had escaped. Keppel did not report Palliser’s\r\ninsubordination, but accounts of the action appeared in the papers, and\r\nbefore the opening of Parliament the incident had become a heated party\r\nissue, with Keppel exalted as a popular hero and Palliser condemned as\r\nthe agent of a negligent and scheming ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_4_\r\n\r\nAffairs stood in this critical posture when Parliament was summoned\r\nin the last week of November. Fearing defection in the Tory ranks,\r\nNorth called a private meeting of his friends beforehand to consult on\r\nstrategy. He was himself there taxed with negligence, and extraordinary\r\nsteps were taken to secure attendance in the government seats. Now a\r\nfavorite parliamentary weapon of North’s had always been humor—or, as\r\nhis opponents styled it, “buffoonery.” His motto, said Walpole, ought\r\nto have been “_Aut dormitabo, aut ridebo_.”[22] And when _Anticipation_\r\nappeared, it was widely believed that North himself had had a hand in its\r\ncomposition.[23] The very favorable reception of the pamphlet must have\r\nsurpassed the hopes of both author and patron. For some days the papers\r\nprinted eulogistic notices and long extracts. Representative is the\r\ncomment in _The Morning Chronicle_ on the day the session opened:\r\n\r\n    The literary piece of mimickry published on Monday last, under\r\n    the title of _Anticipation_, is beyond compare one of the\r\n    ablest sketches ever hit off by a man of fancy and talents.\r\n    Mimicks in general distort the features of those they affect\r\n    to imitate; the author of _Anticipation_, on the contrary,\r\n    has preserved the _vrais-semblance_ of each of the objects of\r\n    imitation with wonderful correctness, and it is a question\r\n    whether he deserves most applause for the humorous conceits\r\n    with which he has dished out the oratory of his heroes, or the\r\n    striking likenesses (in point of order, argument, imagery, and\r\n    diction) which he has drawn of each speaker. Lord G[ranb]y’s\r\n    harangue is, to those who have not been in the House of Commons\r\n    on the first day of a session, a perfect example of Opposition\r\n    oratory on such an occasion.—Mr. T. L[uttre]ll’s speech need\r\n    not have had his name prefixed to it; no member, T. L[uttre]ll\r\n    excepted, could possibly shew so much learning to so little\r\n    purpose.... In a word, _Anticipation_ is one of the best\r\n    pamphlets the publick have been favoured with for years, and\r\n    though it has in some measure a political tendency, ... it\r\n    serves, contrary to the effect of most political pamphlets, to\r\n    put all parties in good humour.\r\n\r\nThe good nature of the parody was remarked by all who spoke of it.\r\nCertainly the pleasantest circumstance of the whole episode is the fact\r\nthat some of the victims of Tickell’s mimicry enjoyed the humor of it;\r\nthough we learn from Walpole that Welbore Ellis, “another justly and\r\nhumourously drawn, proved how justly. He said, ‘It is well written, but I\r\nperceive the author takes me for a dull man.’”[24]\r\n\r\nAccording to a tradition that is not implausible, North and his friends\r\ntook copies of _Anticipation_ into the House on the opening day and\r\ndispensed them gratis.[25] An apparent consequence of this was Tickell’s\r\nluckiest satirical stroke, by virtue of which _Anticipation_ lived on in\r\nthe memory of anecdotists. Walpole, who was on the spot, reported that\r\nCol. Isaac Barré, an Opposition stalwart, “not having seen this pamphlet,\r\nthe first day of the Session cited a foreign Governor with whom he was\r\nacquainted, exactly in the manner here ridiculed, and he also translated\r\na French expression.”[26] This episode grew appreciably in the telling.\r\nIn 1823 Joseph Jekyll told Tom Moore (who wrote down everything he heard)\r\nof the\r\n\r\n    laughable effect on the House of Col. Barré’s speech; he being\r\n    the only one (having just arrived from the country) ignorant of\r\n    the pamphlet, and falling exactly into the same peculiarities\r\n    which the pamphlet quizzed, particularly that of quoting French\r\n    words and then translating them. At every new instance of this\r\n    kind in his speech there was a roar of laughter from the House,\r\n    which Barré, of course, could not understand.[27]\r\n\r\nBut this was not the last refinement. The progress of the story, from\r\ncontemporary witnesses to Jekyll and Moore and finally to “Senex”\r\nwriting his recollections in _Blackwood’s_ in 1826, is an illustration\r\nand a warning of the ways of anecdotists. The humorous success of\r\n_Anticipation_, wrote “Senex,”\r\n\r\n    I well remember.... The style of the speeches was so\r\n    well imitated, and the matter in many cases so happily\r\n    forestalled, that, like Vulcan among Homer’s gods, it caused\r\n    inextinguishable laughter. What gave much zest to the joke\r\n    was the ignorance of most of the usual speaking members that\r\n    any such pamphlet existed. Their great surprise at the loud\r\n    mirth excited by speeches intended to make a very different\r\n    impression, and the frequent cries of “Spoke, Spoke!” the\r\n    meaning of which they could not possibly comprehend, may be\r\n    easily conceived. One of its effects was to shorten the\r\n    debate, for, as the joke soon spread, many were afraid to\r\n    address the House for fear of involving themselves in the\r\n    predicament of those who had been so humorously anticipated.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n_5_\r\n\r\n_Anticipation_ had a great run. Such was the popular demand that a\r\n“Fourth Edition” was advertised by Becket within a week of first\r\npublication. Five more London editions and a Dublin reprint appeared\r\nbefore the end of the year. As soon as copies reached America,\r\n_Anticipation_ was reprinted at both the British headquarters in New York\r\nand the American headquarters in Philadelphia. In announcing his New\r\nYork reprint, James Rivington stated, with what degree of exaggeration\r\nthe reader is free to guess, that “such was the reception given to this\r\nnovel and immensely admired piece, that more than _Forty Thousand_ copies\r\nwere disposed of in a few days.”[29] In London a rash of imitations broke\r\nout at once. _Altercation_, _Deliberation_, _Anticipation Continued_,\r\n_Anticipation for the Year MDCCLXXIX_, _The Exhibition, or a Second\r\nAnticipation_—all these appeared within a year. As late as 1812 appeared\r\n_Anticipation: or, The Prize Address; which will be delivered at the\r\nOpening of the New Drury Lane Theatre_, a squib inspired by the same\r\ncircumstances that gave rise to the celebrated _Rejected Addresses_\r\nof James and Horace Smith. And there were others. But, as Dr. Johnson\r\nremarked of _The Splendid Shilling_, “the merit of such performances\r\nbegins and ends with the first author.”[30]\r\n\r\nThere was another result of the publication of the satire that, to\r\nTickell, was perhaps the most gratifying of all. The author was right,\r\nobserved _The London Magazine_ in its review, in predicting a majority\r\nfor Administration in his mimic debate; “and we verily believe he might\r\nhave added by way of note at the end—‘This will get me a place or a\r\npension.’”[31] This impertinence was justified by the event. On the 6th\r\nof December Richard Rigby, Paymaster and general factotum in North’s\r\ncabinet, wrote David Garrick a short but meaningful note: “I have had\r\na meeting with _Anticipation_, and like him very much; I wish to have\r\nsome further discourse with you upon that subject. Could you call here\r\nto-morrow morning about eleven?”[32] The subject was unquestionably a\r\nministerial reward for services rendered. About this time Tickell was\r\ngranted a pension of 200_l._ _per annum_.[33] Soon afterward an anonymous\r\npoet of the Batheaston circle returned good for evil in praising Tickell\r\nwhile attempting to recall him to virtue:\r\n\r\n      Some writers be of an amphibious race,\r\n    And prose and verse their elemental place.\r\n    Such he, whose wit made wond’ring senates roar,\r\n    And those to blush that never blush’d before.\r\n    _Anticipation_ gave him sterling fame,\r\n    _The Wreath of Fashion_ a poetic name.\r\n    And Nature gave, and at the gift repines,\r\n    At pension’d wit and prostituted lines.\r\n    Be your’s, O _Tickell_, to correct this vice,\r\n    That deals out praise or censure at a price,\r\n    And in one grand example prove to men,\r\n    How weak is Wit, when Party holds the pen;\r\n    And while you glow with more than virtue’s flame,\r\n    And all admire from whence such virtue came,\r\n    Each literary Swiss shall dread thy rage,\r\n    Dismiss their weapons, and no more engage.[34]\r\n\r\nBut man cannot live by wit alone. In the next two years Tickell wrote\r\ntwo more satirical tracts for the ministry, which, though not dull, were\r\nscarcely inspired; and in August 1781 he was appointed a commissioner\r\nof the Stamp Office. Here, with other beneficiaries of ministerial\r\ngenerosity and a salary of 500_l._, he stayed. A year earlier (25 July\r\n1780) he had married Miss Mary Linley, a charming and witty young lady if\r\nless renowned than her sister Elizabeth (Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan).\r\nIn September 1782, doubtless through the good offices of Lord North, they\r\nsettled in an apartment in the Gold Staff Gallery at the top of Hampton\r\nCourt Palace.[35] Tickell’s talents were useful in the Linley-Sheridan\r\nfamily enterprise of Drury Lane Theatre. He served in the capacity of Mr.\r\nPuff as “a Practitioner of Panegyric” in the newspapers, refurbished old\r\nplays, and tried his hand, with mild success, at composing librettos.\r\nWhen Fox and North formed their coalition government (of unhappy\r\nmemory), Tickell’s political allegiance was transferred to the Whigs.\r\nThat he had long had a preference for Whig society appears from the\r\nsatirical-affectionate picture of Brooks’s Club in his _Epistle from\r\nthe Honourable Charles Fox, Partridge-Shooting, to the Honourable John\r\nTownshend, Cruising_, 1779. The devoted but sharp-tongued Mrs. Tickell\r\ninformed her sister in a letter of 1785: “So I find the election has\r\ntaken a happy turn at last and I am to congratulate myself with being\r\nthe wife of a member of Brooks’s.... T. is delighted; the great point\r\nof his ambition is gained.”[36] To which she added, at the thought of\r\nher husband’s increased opportunities for conviviality: “Farewell, a\r\nlong farewell to all my comforts.”[37] From the many fragments of Mary\r\nTickell’s spritely letters that have been printed here and there, it is\r\nimpossible not to give at least one representative passage showing both\r\nhusband and wife in character. In an undated letter from Hampton Court\r\nshe wrote:\r\n\r\n    The men stayed last night or rather this morning till four or\r\n    five tho’ I entreated T⸺. to think of to-night’s fatigue for\r\n    me and let them go, but ’twas all in vain, for the moment my\r\n    back was turn’d off they march’d into the other room with their\r\n    Bottles and Glasses and order’d Stephen to bring the fire after\r\n    them—so at least they had the grace to think of not disturbing\r\n    me, for you are to know since the cold wether we dine and sup\r\n    in the Drawing Room. However unfortunately my ears were quick\r\n    enough to reach to Stephen’s Pantry where I heard every cruel\r\n    Pop of that odious five shilling claret which entirely hindered\r\n    my closing my eyes, so here I am at half past one just after\r\n    breakfast and thinking of my evening’s dissipation. Don’t you\r\n    think that I should cut a figure in the great world?[38]\r\n\r\nAs a member of the glittering Whig fraternity that moved about Fox,\r\nSheridan, and the Prince of Wales, Tickell became a large contributor to\r\nthe great collective (and perennial) satire known as _The Rolliad_, a\r\nshilling edition of which, George Saintsbury once remarked, if properly\r\nannotated, would keep one amused from London to York. He also produced a\r\nnumber of more or less serious pamphlets attacking Pitt’s government; and\r\nduring the regency crisis of 1788-89 he worked feverishly with the other\r\nFoxites in the expectation of a Whig triumph. But the King recovered, the\r\nWhigs’ hopes were dashed, and Tickell never obtained his expected seat in\r\nParliament.[39]\r\n\r\nMary Tickell died in July 1787. Two years later Tickell eloped with the\r\ndaughter of a captain in the East India Company’s service, Miss Sarah\r\nLey, a reigning beauty who was for a time the rival of Emma Hamilton as\r\nRomney’s model.[40] She was very young, very extravagant, and without any\r\nfortune. In a year or two her husband, who was chronically improvident\r\nand was now deprived of Mary Tickell’s common sense, found himself\r\noverwhelmed with debts. In May 1793 he appealed to Warren Hastings\r\nfor a loan of 500_l._ and obtained it.[41] Hastings was a friend of\r\nthe Ley family, but that an intimate of the Fox-Sheridan circle and a\r\ncontributor to _The Rolliad_ should have turned to him for help is an\r\nindication of Tickell’s desperate straits. The loan was evidently not\r\nsufficient for his needs. On the 4th of November his lifeless body was\r\nfound below the parapet outside his Hampton Court apartment. Two days\r\nlater Joseph Farington recorded in his _Diary_: “Distressed circumstances\r\nand an apprehension of being arrested, it is said, is the cause of this\r\nmomentary phrenzy.”[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n_6_\r\n\r\nAs a successful parody of parliamentary proceedings and eloquence at\r\nthe time of the American Revolution, _Anticipation_ retains historical\r\ninterest. One reviewer went so far as to say that a comparison of the\r\nactual debate with Tickell’s anticipated version would show that between\r\nthe two “the difference as to the material grounds of disputation is\r\ntrifling.”[43] This is scarcely an exaggeration, though, as it turned\r\nout, the House was less full and the debate less animated than had been\r\nexpected from the presence in town of so many generals and admirals\r\nknown to be at odds with one another and the ministers. As a parodist,\r\nhowever, Tickell was less concerned to present the substance of a\r\nparticular debate than the idiosyncracies of those who spoke frequently\r\nin the House, whether from Opposition or Administration benches. The\r\nverisimilitude of his subjects’ accents, attitudes, and hobby-horses\r\nof theme was unanimously acknowledged and praised by contemporaries.\r\n_Anticipation_ is in short a speaking picture of that House of Commons\r\nin which, as well as in America, a bitter conflict was in progress. Here\r\nare Burke’s rumbling periods on the decline of the British Empire, and\r\nFox’s skilful arguments to show that neither an offensive nor a defensive\r\nwar can be successfully continued in America. David Hartley the younger\r\nquotes the recent sentiments of his friend Benjamin Franklin in Paris,\r\nand a radical Member from the City praises Washington and threatens\r\nministers with the Tower and the block. Other Whigs attack profiteering\r\narmy contractors, false news in the _Gazettes_, and the employment of\r\nIndians to butcher the colonists; others demand parliamentary inquiries\r\nthat government officials suggest deferring until “about six months after\r\nChristmas.” Late in the evening Lord North rises and, after invoking the\r\nmighty shade of Chatham, takes up his secretary’s notes on speeches by\r\nthe Opposition and urges upon an unruly House the need of unanimity.\r\n\r\nIt is a vivid and authentic picture, and it is also an entertaining\r\none. Though parody is a minor genre, it has its masterpieces. But\r\nthey should be read rather than talked about. Let the last opinion on\r\n_Anticipation_ be that of George IV, who was a person of discernment\r\nin these matters. J. W. Croker recorded in his diary that at a royal\r\ndinner-party in January 1822 the talk had turned to Tickell. The King\r\nspoke of _Anticipation_ “_con amore_ and quoted some of the speeches.” He\r\npromised to have a copy looked out for Lady Conyngham, who had never read\r\nit. “The events and the pieces were gone by,” said the King; “but the wit\r\nand pleasantry of it never could fade.”[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION_\r\n\r\n[1] A certain A.

The\r\ncritical situation of public affairs seemed to require an extraordinary\r\ndiffusion of political knowledge; yet, in the common course, but few of\r\nthe millions, who are so deeply interested in the result of parliamentary\r\ndebates, can be admitted to an audience of them. Sometimes, the Members\r\nshut their galleries against the intrusion of any of their Constituents;\r\nand it is always a standing order, from the opening of the session, to\r\nprohibit the publication of their debates. Under these circumstances,\r\nan authentic account of the first day’s debate, put forth at this date,\r\nwill clearly avoid any breach of that order, and, without exposing the\r\nConstituents to crowding in the gallery, to furnish them with their\r\nRepresentatives Speeches, taken down with the strictest fidelity, cannot\r\nbut afford them some amusement, and indeed real use. Besides, the first\r\nday’s debate is generally a kind of outline of the debates of the whole\r\nsession; so that a critical observer, by contemplating the buds and\r\nseedlings of this early eloquence, may calculate what degree of radical\r\nstrength they possess, how far they will expand and bloom, and whether\r\nthey are hardy enough to stand the winter.\r\n\r\nThe Editor cannot but seize this opportunity to thank those Gentlemen\r\nwho have furnished him with the _most authentic materials_ for some of\r\nthe speeches, which, they will immediately see, he has copied _verbatim_\r\nfrom their manuscripts—and he sincerely hopes, their having appeared in\r\nprint _before_ they are spoken, will not deter the several Gentlemen from\r\ndelivering them with their usual appearance of _extempore_ eloquence.\r\n\r\n    November 23, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Gentlemen trading to the East-Indies, West-Indies,\r\n    and other parts, who intend taking or sending thither any\r\n    pamphlets this season, are hereby informed, that this work is\r\n    authentic, faithful, and strictly impartial; and as the nice\r\n    and discerning eye of the British islands and settlements near\r\n    us, must feel an interest in these matters, good allowance will\r\n    be given for taking quantities.—Also the best Dutch wax, and\r\n    stationary wares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTICIPATION, &c.\r\n\r\n_Dom. Comm. Jovis. 26 Nov. die._\r\n\r\n_Anno 19ᵒ Georgii III Regis, 1778._\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Francis M[olyneu]x, gentleman-usher of the black rod, having, with\r\nthe usual solemnity, at half past two o’clock, given three admonitory\r\nraps at the door of the H[ous]e of C[ommo]ns, and being thereupon\r\nadmitted, and having proceeded towards the table, with three progressive\r\nbows, acquainted the S[peake]r,[1] that his M[ajest]y commanded their\r\nimmediate attendance in the H[ous]e of L[or]ds, where soon after his\r\nM[ajest]y delivered his most gracious speech to both Houses; which we\r\nshould give at length, having an accurate copy now before us, but that\r\nmany reasons concur to induce us rather to give a general sketch of it.\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say, that respect to that great personage is\r\nthe principal of those motives: It is also universally felt, that the\r\nmerit of those speeches consists much less in the composition than in the\r\ndelivery. Besides, as an authentic _black letter_ copy of _this_ speech\r\nwill infallibly appear, we have too high a respect for our good friends\r\nMessrs. the Hawkers and Criers of this great metropolis, to rob them of\r\nany part of the fruits of their annual eloquence on this occasion⸺The\r\nspeech began by saying,\r\n\r\nThat the situation of public affairs induced him to call them thus early\r\ntogether, that they might more fully enter into the various and important\r\nconcerns which would naturally engage their attention.\r\n\r\nThat he had reason to hope that the schemes which the natural enemies\r\nof this country, in conjunction with their unnatural allies, had\r\nmeditated against us in the West-Indies, notwithstanding some appearance\r\nof success, might, under Divine Providence, fail in the object of\r\ndistressing the commercial interest of his people, which, it gave him\r\nsatisfaction to observe, had hitherto continued to flourish amidst the\r\ncalamities of war, while that of the enemy had received the most material\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nThat he could not but behold with particular pleasure the zeal and ardour\r\nshewn by all his subjects on this emergency, which had fully secured the\r\nsafety of this country, and convinced our enemies that every attempt\r\nagainst the internal prosperity of Great Britain must prove ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThat he continued to receive the most friendly assurances of the pacific\r\ndispositions of the other powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nThat his desire of re-establishing the general tranquility could not be\r\ndoubted; and as he had not been the first to disturb the peace, so he\r\nshould embrace the earliest opportunity of putting an end to the horrors\r\nof war, whenever that desirable end could be effected, consistently with\r\nthe honour of his crown, and the interest of his subjects, which he\r\nshould ever be careful to preserve.\r\n\r\nThat his faithful C[o]mm[o]ns might depend on the proper officers\r\nimmediately laying before them the estimate for the expences of the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\nThat he lamented that the present situation of affairs should oblige him\r\nto call upon his faithful subjects for any additional supplies, but\r\n\r\nThat his faithful C[o]mm[o]ns might depend on the strictest œconomy on\r\nhis part, in the application of such sums as they should judge necessary\r\nfor the public service, and he doubted not they would see the expediency\r\nof providing for such contingencies as might arise from the continuance\r\nof war, and the measures necessary to be taken for the re-establishment\r\nof peace upon an honourable and permanent foundation.\r\n\r\nIt concluded with relying on the wisdom and unanimity of Parliament; on\r\nthe good conduct of his Generals and Admirals; on the valor of his Fleets\r\nand Armies; and on the zeal and spirit of all his faithful subjects.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the C[ommo]ns to their House, the speech having been\r\nread as usual from the chair, a motion for an Address, conformable to\r\nthe several sentences in the speech, and expressive of the firmness and\r\nunanimity of the House at this important crisis, was made and seconded by\r\ntwo young Members; the particular phraseology of which leading speeches\r\nwe shall not retail, it being universally admitted that the rhetoric\r\napplied to these occasions, is not very replete with originality. Our\r\nreaders will easily imagine the proper quantity of tropes and metaphors,\r\napologies for inexperience, elegant timidities, graceful blushes, studied\r\nhesitations, army safe at New-York, fleets likewise safe, individuals\r\nenriched, perfect content at home, nothing wanting but unanimity in\r\ncouncil, &c. &c. &c. which ornamented and enriched these anniversary\r\npanegyrics. We shall hasten therefore to the more material part of the\r\ndebate, which commenced by the following speech from Lord G[ranb]y[2],\r\nproposing the amendment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord G[ran]by.]\r\n\r\n_Lord G[ran]by._ Conscious of my own inability, and sinking under the\r\nsense of my little knowledge or experience, totally unprovided with any\r\nideas for the present occasion, and absolutely ignorant not only of the\r\nforms but even the modes of proceeding in this house, may I, Sir, in this\r\nstate of imbecility, be permitted to take the lead on this first and\r\nmost important day of the session? May I, Sir, all unequal to so arduous\r\na task, be allowed to dictate, if not to the whole house, at least to\r\nthis side of it, the proper and only constitutional method of compelling\r\nministers to furnish us with the means of discovering some errors in\r\ntheir conduct; and to enable us to demonstrate to the nation at large\r\ntheir total incapacity for filling the places which they now hold?—There\r\nwas a time, Sir, when this side of the house would not tamely acquiesce\r\nin so dangerous a precedent as any minister’s retaining his office for\r\nthe unconstitutional duration of seven years. Have we forgot, Sir, the\r\ngreat name of Pulteny? Pulteny, Sir! the virtuous Pulteny! Pulteny,\r\nthe wonder of the age! Pulteny, that steady Patriot, whose Herculean\r\neloquence overcame the Hydra of corruption! or have we forgot, Sir, that\r\ninestimable character of our own times, whose virtues compelled the\r\nadmiration of this profligate age; whose memory excites the veneration\r\nof every patriot mind? Let it not be objected that these illustrious\r\ncharacters were dazzled by the splendour of a coronet: I will not answer\r\nsuch frivolous remarks:—Sir, I wander from the question: Yet let me\r\nremind this House, that those great patriots were ever foremost in taking\r\nthat part which now falls to my lot. They, Sir, were ever ready to awaken\r\nthe fears, and rouze the apprehensions, of the Country Gentlemen; and\r\nthat, Sir, is my object:—They, Sir, compelled Adm[i]n[i]str[a]t[io]n to\r\ndisclose the inmost recess of official iniquity; and that, Sir, that\r\nis also my intention. Sir, with this view, I shall humbly move you,\r\nthat in place of the present Address, which I cannot but consider as\r\nthe selfish panegyric of Adm[i]n[i]str[a]t[io]n, immediately after the\r\ngeneral expressions of respect for his M[ajest]y, the following words may\r\nbe substituted, in order to our acquiring that full and comprehensive\r\nknowledge of public affairs, which is so indispensably necessary at the\r\nopening of this interesting and important session of P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt.\r\n\r\n“Your faithful C[o]mm[o]ns, deeply impressed with a sense of your\r\nM[ajest]y’s unwearied anxiety to promote the dignity and glory of Great\r\nBritain, cannot but lament the many unhappy circumstances which have\r\nconspired to disturb your M[ajest]y’s happiness, and to prejudice the\r\ninterests and honour of this country. When we find that the most liberal\r\nsupplies for our naval equipments have as yet produced none of those\r\nhappy effects which might reasonably have been expected to be derived\r\nfrom so powerful an armament, particularly under the direction of an\r\nofficer of experienced conduct and courage, we cannot but express our\r\nserious apprehensions of some fatal misconduct, either on the part of\r\nAdministration, by forming indecisive and contradictory instructions\r\nfor the direction of the Navy, or, in the particular department for\r\nnaval affairs, of some misapplication of those liberal supplies, which,\r\nif wisely and faithfully applied, could not have failed, under divine\r\nprovidence, and your M[ajest]y’s wisdom, of obtaining the most salutary\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we, your M[ajest]y’s most faithful C[o]mm[o]ns, most\r\nhumbly intreat your M[ajest]y to order the proper Officers to lay before\r\nthe House, copies of the secret instructions for the conduct of the Fleet\r\ncommanded by Admiral K[e]pp[e]l—estimates of the quantity of ballast used\r\nin the several ships of the division of the fleet commanded by Admiral\r\nK[e]pp[e]l—bills of parcel of the number of square yards of sail-cloth,\r\ntogether with samples of ditto, intended to be used in the division of\r\nthe Fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Sir H[u]gh P[a]ll[i]s[e]r—succinct\r\naccounts of the quota of biscuits, and ratio of salt-beef distributed\r\nin the Fleet—faithful transcripts of the several Log-Books of each\r\nvessel—abstracts of all letters, notes, and messages that passed and\r\nrepassed, off Ushant, between the Admirals and Ph[i]l[i]p St[e]v[e]ns,\r\nEsq. during the course of last summer—and, finally, minute copies of all\r\naccounts unsettled or passed, open or closed, paid or unpaid, between\r\nthe Commissioners of the Navy, and all sorts of Manufacturers, Sailors,\r\nContractors, &c. &c. &c. employed by them for these twenty years last\r\npast⸺It is from a minute investigation of these important papers, that\r\nyour M[ajest]y’s most faithful C[o]mm[o]ns can alone derive just grounds\r\nfor censure or exculpation. And, however laborious this investigation\r\nmay prove, we, your M[ajest]y’s most faithful C[o]mm[o]ns, beg leave to\r\nassure your M[ajest]y, we shall most readily devote our utmost attention\r\nto so salutary a study, in order to promote a quick dispatch of public\r\nbusiness at this momentous and aweful crisis, and to give vigour and\r\neffect to those measures which your M[ajest]y, in your great wisdom,\r\nmay think necessary to secure the safety, interest, and honour of Great\r\nBritain.”\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, is the amendment which I have the honour to offer to the\r\nconsideration of this house. It will immediately strike you, Sir, that\r\nin the accounts which I propose to have submitted to the investigation\r\nof P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt, I have avoided asking for one scrap of paper that\r\nis not absolutely necessary to be seen and thoroughly studied by the\r\nHouse. Should it, however, appear necessary to Gentlemen to _add_ to the\r\nlist of these official documents, I am sure I shall not oppose such an\r\nimprovement to the motion, to whatever quantity it may extend.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. G[eor]g[e] S[u]tt[o]n.]\r\n\r\nMr. _G[eo]rg[e] S[u]tt[o]n_ seconded the motion for the amendment,\r\nbeginning with a similar acknowledgement of his incapacity, his\r\ninexperience and ignorance of P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry affairs; declining\r\ntherefore to enter into any further argument, the subject having been\r\ndiscussed in so full and able a manner by his most noble cousin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. W[e]lb[o]re Ell[i]s.]\r\n\r\nMr. _W[e]lb[o]re Ell[i]s_, in reply, threw out many sagacious and\r\nnovel observations. He said that he highly commended the caution and\r\ncircumspection of the noble Lord, but, that in his opinion, a more proper\r\ntime would arrive, about six months after Christmas, for entering into\r\nthe details proposed by the Amendment; as, at that period, Administration\r\nwould certainly have more leisure for furnishing the papers now called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nHe very properly observed, that selecting these few curious articles of\r\npolitical intelligence from a variety of miscellaneous papers, would\r\nrequire some short time, together with no small degree of discernment,\r\nnot to mention several thousands of extra clerks. He said, he had taken\r\nthe trouble to make a most serious investigation into the Journals, the\r\nVotes, the Debates, and all the P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry Records of this\r\ncountry; and he was free to say, that notwithstanding it might at first\r\nappear rather a novel idea, yet it was his opinion, that _The Address_ on\r\nthe first day was a matter of compliment. Nay, touching the matter before\r\nhim, (and weighty and powerful indeed it was) after the most mature and\r\nserious deliberation, daily and nightly, he would for once venture to\r\nhazard a rhetorical, a figurative expression, to wit, that the Address\r\nwas an eccho, as it were, a complimentary eccho, of his M[ajest]y’s most\r\ngracious speech.—He hinted, that, if any Gentleman wished for particular\r\nenquiries, he would, as an old Member, long conversant with the forms\r\nof the House, tell him, that certainly a Committee might be appointed\r\nto carry on any public enquiry; and he believed such Committees were\r\nnot unfrequent.—And here he remarked, that, from all his researches, it\r\nappeared to him, that the constitution of this country was of a triple\r\nnature—K[i]ng—L[o]rds—and C[o]mm[o]ns—that, these three opposite and\r\nrepelling powers, reciprocally ballanced and counteracted each other; at\r\nthe same time that they contributed to the proportion and harmony of the\r\nwhole.—He took occasion to observe, that freedom of Debate was clearly\r\na P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry privilege, and he would pledge himself to prove\r\nthat every Member in that House was a representative of his constituents.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, he concluded with dissenting from the Amendment as\r\ntrite, abstruse, dangerous, and frivolous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D[a]v[i]d H[a]rtly, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_D[a]v[i]d H[a]rtly_, Esq.[3] observed, that these were no times for\r\nflattery and empty adulation.—For his part, he should enter at large into\r\nthe rise and origin of all Colonies, ancient and modern, into the history\r\nof Taxation, and its effects on every state that had exercised it over\r\nits colonies; and then review the cause, commencement, and conduct of\r\nthe whole American war. He felt how arduous, how complicated a task this\r\nmust prove to himself, and how difficult for the House to understand.\r\nThat, to lessen that difficulty, both to the House and to himself, he\r\nwould adopt the most logical method to give clearness and perspicuity\r\nto such a multitude and diversity of ideas; and for that purpose, he\r\nbegged Gentlemen to take notice, that he should divide his speech into\r\nfour and twenty grand divisions, each of which should contain as many\r\nsubdivisions, which subdivisions should also be separately discussed in\r\nequal number of sections, each section to be split also into the same\r\nnumber of heads; so that with grand divisions, subdivisions, sections,\r\nand heads, the number of distinct propositions would amount to several\r\nthousands; but that Gentlemen, by attending closely, and correctly taking\r\ndown the number of any particular argument, should have an immediate\r\nexplicit answer to any query touching that individual number: and he\r\nflattered himself this numerical logic and arithmetic of eloquence would\r\ngreatly tend to clarify their understandings.\r\n\r\nTo follow this gentleman thro’ even one of his grand divisions, was a\r\ntask much beyond the utmost rapidity of a short-hand writer. Indeed the\r\nnoise from all parts of the house was so excessive, during the several\r\nhours which he engrossed in this laborious harangue, that it was totally\r\nimpossible to catch up any thing beyond the mutilated fragments, and\r\nruins of his oratory. At length however the house sunk into a sudden\r\ncalm, upon the disclosure of a fact, which seemed to startle even the\r\nwildest zealots of faction.—For, after every other argument was exhausted\r\nto so little purpose, inflamed by disappointment, and hurried, as we\r\nare willing to suppose, by the violence of patriotism, the Honourable\r\nGentleman avowed to the House, that one of his grounds for denouncing\r\nruin to his country was _his private knowledge of DR. FRANKLYN’S\r\nsentiments on that head_.[4] “Dr. Franklyn (he exclaimed) the Cromwell\r\nof his age, Dr. Franklyn, Ambassador Plenipotentiary from America to\r\nFrance, is my most intimate and most cordial friend!”⸺He went on by\r\ndeclaring, he had passed great part of the summer at Paris, with Dr.\r\nFranklyn, in the most unreserved communication of sentiments and facts;\r\nand he concluded with repeating, as the joint result of his own and Dr.\r\nFranklin’s deliberation, that the glory of England was destroyed for\r\never!⸺This extraordinary confession produced however no violent effect.\r\nMinisters seemed to receive it with a contemptuous pity, not unmingled\r\nwith ridicule,[5] when _Mr. W[ilke]s_, finding the little success of\r\nserious treason, rose, and indulged himself in the more ludicrous stile\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. W[ilke]s.]\r\n\r\n_Mr. W[ilke]s_[6] adverted with some degree of humour to the inference\r\nof victory and triumph which might be deduced from the return of our\r\nGenerals and our Admirals, and one of our commissioners too. They found\r\n(he said) that being on the spot interrupted their manœuvres, and he\r\nsupposed they were come three thousand miles off to act _cooly_. That,\r\nthe object they were sent to accomplish was confessedly a great one;\r\nand it is well known, that objects of a certain magnitude are best\r\ncontemplated at a distance. Probably, their optics were too tender to\r\ndistinguish with accuracy amidst the smoak and confusion incident to\r\nactual engagements; or perhaps, they reflected on the more imminent\r\ndangers of domestic invasion, and hastened home from pure patriotism\r\nto guard their native country.—At any rate, he must compliment their\r\ndiscernment in pursuing a line of conduct, which could not fail of\r\nconciliating the good opinion and sympathetic regard of the Noble Lord,\r\nwho presided in the American department. If therefore, Mr. Speaker,\r\nby any miraculous change, I were, this day, to become the Advocate\r\nof Administration, I should mark the inutility of recurring to the\r\nwritten evidence, which the Amendment calls for, at a moment when we\r\nare so copiously provided with _vivâ voce_ testimony. Yet, Sir, I do\r\nnot think, upon reflexion, that Ministers will adopt this ground for\r\nrejecting the noble Lord’s Amendment. They, Sir, will more boldly tell\r\nyou—you shall have neither,—for, in these times, it is the fashion for\r\nall modern Statesmen, first to tell their own story, and then protest\r\nsolemnly against being cross-examined—_or directly, or indirectly,\r\nanswering question, query, or otherwise_. I believe I am accurate in my\r\nquotation.—I am not indeed surprized at these declarations of obstinate\r\nsilence—this is Scottish policy—the example was set by my good old\r\nfriend, the E[a]rl of B[u]te—for therein I am orthodox in my faith, that\r\nthe Son is equal to the Father; and I am sure I may add with Athanasian\r\nzeal, the father is incomprehensible, and the Son is incomprehensible,\r\nyet there are not two incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n    (Here a confused cry of order, and the Chaplain reprimanded for\r\n    laughing.)\r\n\r\nThere is indeed one North Briton of whom I entertain a better hope.—He\r\nseems to have caught that itch for liberty, which, to our great wonder,\r\nbroke out in the Highlands last summer. He, Sir, even in the character\r\nof his M[ajest]y’s Commissi[o]ner, solicited the intimacy of _General\r\nWashington_. But indeed, Sir, if ever a Scotchman can be suspected of\r\nloving liberty, it is not when he has recently become a convert to\r\nAdministration: _Washington_ therefore sent his Excellency, the worthy\r\nCommissioner, a flat refusal.—Mr. _Laurens_ too refused his Excellency\r\nthe hearing he so generously solicited by imploring Congress, “_not to\r\nfollow the example of Br[i]t[ai]n in the hour of her insolence_;” the\r\n_hearing_ was however refused, nay even the “_sight of the country_,”\r\nand “_the sight of its worthy patriots_” was peremptorily refused. The\r\nAmericans, Sir, think that a Scotchman has neither eyes nor ears for\r\nliberty, or, at least, they distrusted the capacity of his Excellency’s\r\norgans for such an object.—I have a letter, Sir, in my pocket from my\r\nhonest friend Ethan Allen; I would read it, but I am sure you won’t let\r\nme: He knows I am fond of scripture quotations, and tells me Congress\r\nwould have given your Scotch commissioner this _hearing_, but they knew\r\n“he was like unto the deaf adder, who regardeth not the voice of the\r\ncharmer.”\r\n\r\nLet me then trouble his Excellency with one question; who was it\r\nsuggested this secret correspondence with the enemy? was it not the\r\nScottish secretary of this wise commission, Dr. Adam Ferguson? It must\r\nhave been one of Sir John Dalrymple’s associates in literature. The\r\nScotch, if they can get no Englishman to act, as they pretend to say the\r\ngreat Sidney did, will make even their own countrymen treacherous in one\r\nage, to furnish some literary assassin of the next with the foul vouchers\r\nof treachery and baseness. At all events, Sir, I shall heartily give my\r\nvote for the amendment, as the only means to convict the M[i]n[i]stry of\r\nwhat I know they are guilty, weakness, incapacity, ignorance, obstinacy,\r\nbaseness, and treachery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor J[o]hns[o]n.]\r\n\r\n_Governor J[o]hns[o]n_[7] now rose, and said every thing that a Gentleman\r\nin his melancholly situation could be supposed to urge. Spoke much of\r\nthe want of candour in putting a false construction on his actions,\r\nwhich he could assure the House, upon his honour, were all dictated by\r\nthe best intentions; that he should not undertake to enter into a full\r\ndefence of his conduct at present, as it was a very delicate business,\r\nand turned upon a very nice chain of circumstances. One part of the\r\ncharges against him he would slightly touch upon, his letters, and what\r\nhe supposed was meant to be hinted at, his attempts of bribery. That\r\nthe artful policy of France had made it necessary for him to parry her\r\nattacks by similar weapons; that he believed it was felt and would be\r\nadmitted by all parts of that House, that there is no greater spring of\r\npublic actions, in all political assemblies, than _self-interest_. That\r\nhe felt himself justified in his own mind for every step he had taken,\r\nfor he would venture to affirm, that in every negociation true wisdom\r\nand sound policy justified the moral fitness of secret articles, and\r\nthe honourable expediency of powerful temptations. As to the failure of\r\nsuccess, on the part of the commissioners, various causes had concurred\r\nto occasion it. They were sent to treat of peace with a retreating army.\r\nPhiladelphia, the chief residence of the moderate men, and most friendly\r\nto their negociation, was evacuated by the army, on the Commissioners\r\narrival. A little after they had got to New-York, Mons. D’Estaign was\r\nupon the coast. These circumstances gave spirits to a declining cause;\r\nand America, _in this hour of her insolence_, refused to treat, unless\r\nher independence was specifically acknowledged.\r\n\r\nWhat followed afterwards is a very serious business, indeed; but I trust\r\nI shall be pardoned by a noble Lord opposite to me, high in character,\r\nand in the esteem of his country, if I freely say, as my opinion, that\r\nMonsieur D’Estaign’s fleet ought to have been attacked by the Br[i]t[i]sh\r\nat Rhode-Island, as soon as the French came out of the harbour to fight\r\nthem. And I will further say, considering the spirit, the gallantry,\r\nand the heroism of the British Seamen, the inequality of the force of\r\nthe fleets was not sufficient to justify the not attacking the French\r\nfleet, without waiting a length of time to gain the weather guage, and\r\ntrusting so long as the Engl[i]sh fleet did there to an unruly element.\r\nSir, in the actions in the West-Indies, between the English and French\r\nfleets, last war, where the former were greatly inferior both in number\r\nand weight of metal, the French were beat off and obliged to fly for\r\nit. So, in the case of the Monmouth, the Dorsetshire, and several other\r\ninstances, inferiority in the outset of the contest proved victorious in\r\nthe end. I will not, however, dwell upon matters which merely depend upon\r\nopinion, and upon which the best officer in the world may be mistaken.\r\nBut, Sir, after the tempest at Rhode-Island, when the Noble Lord returned\r\nto New-York to refit, was not time lost? the very time that might have\r\nbeen employed in separating D’Estaign from Boston harbour? I might say,\r\nSir, in the defeat of D’Estaign; for, after the arrival of some of\r\nB[y]r[o]n’s squadron, the Noble Lord was superior to him.⸺It is a very\r\nunpleasant task to speak out, but I cannot avoid giving my opinion as\r\na seaman, and as one upon the spot, acquainted with the delays in this\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Sir, my opinion, in a very few words is this: The violent\r\nand impolitic measures of the M[i]n[i]stry of this country first lost\r\nAmerica⸺the Br[i]t[i]sh army might have regained it⸺and our fleet has\r\nlost more than one opportunity of crushing that of France, upon which\r\nAmerican resistance chiefly depended for protection and support.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord H[o]we.]\r\n\r\n_Lord H[o]we_ and _Mr. R[i]gby_ now rose; but the house appearing\r\ninclined to give the former an immediate opportunity to reply, Mr.\r\nR[i]gby sat down, and Lord H[o]we, in very modest yet pointed terms,\r\nremarked on the unfairness which, he must say, the Honourable Gentleman\r\nwho spoke last, had discovered both in the design and manner of his\r\nspeech. That, first, to avoid entering into the motives and principles of\r\nhis own conduct, as being more proper objects for a particular committee\r\nof enquiry, and then to launch out into vague and desultory accusations\r\nof any other person, was inconsistent, and, he was sorry to add,\r\nilliberal. That whatever prejudices those reflections were intended to\r\ncreate against his conduct, he would not then interrupt the business of\r\nthe day, and the more general subjects of the present debate, but trust\r\nto the candour of the house for suspending their opinion, until the whole\r\nof his conduct might be minutely investigated by a committee appointed\r\nfor that purpose; which committee, he himself should be the first man in\r\nthat house to solicit, nay demand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. R[i]gby.]\r\n\r\n_Mr. R[i]gby._⸺I should not, Sir, have troubled the house on this first\r\nday, but that I felt it the indispensable duty of private friendship,\r\nto express my feelings on the happy return of our worthy Commissioner,\r\nwho has given you, Sir, so full and satisfactory an account both of his\r\nprinciples and conduct.⸺I shall not trouble you long, Sir; I rise only\r\nfor that purpose.⸺I am sure there is no Gentleman in this house, who\r\nmore heartily congratulates the worthy Commissioner on his unembarrassed\r\ncountenance and his good looks. He certainly has passed the summer very\r\nprofitably—the voyage seems to have improved his stock of spirits—I\r\nthink, I never saw him appear to more advantage—I own, however, I\r\nsincerely regret the unpoliteness of his American friends. After such\r\ncondescending invitations of himself, it was not very civil of those\r\nGentlemen to send excuses—If he had been admitted to their society, I\r\nhave no manner of doubt of the wonderful effects his eloquence would have\r\nwrought. Even if they had allowed him a sight of the country, a man of\r\nhis taste would have brought us home some curious American memoirs: but,\r\nalas! he was not only disappointed in that wish, but in one of a still\r\ngentler kind. I mean, Sir, a _Flirtation Treaty_, which he _attempted_,\r\nto negotiate with a celebrated female politician, the _Messalina of\r\nCongress_. I say attempted, Sir; for unfortunately even there too his\r\nExcellency met with as cold a reception. Unfortunately! for, had the Lady\r\nindulged him with a _hearing_, or even a _sight_, what surer line to lay\r\nthe foundation of a more lasting connection? But, in short, Sir, whether\r\nfrom fate or insufficiency, the affair dropt, and the _Flirtation Treaty_\r\nfell to the ground⸺ ⸺Sir, I trouble the house very seldom, and with as\r\nfew words as possible⸺my opinion continues to be what it invariably\r\nhas been, with respect to America—this country may be deprived of its\r\ninterests, its dignity, and its honour; but, as I never can give my\r\nassent to a voluntary surrender of them, I most heartily agree in the\r\nsupport which the address proposes to afford to his M[ajest]y.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. T. T[o]wns[e]nd.]\r\n\r\nMr. _T. T[o]wns[e]nd_ rose, and with great vehemence arraigned the levity\r\nof the Right Honourable Gentleman who spoke before him; he thought it\r\nhighly indecent, at this important crisis, when the very existence of\r\nthis country is at stake, that any Gentleman should endeavour to raise\r\na laugh, and turn the momentous deliberations of that day into ridicule.\r\nUnder such circumstances, in his opinion, jocularity was flagitious, and\r\nwit became blasphemy. He had, himself, sat in three P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nts,\r\nand he appealed to the candour of that house, whether in that length\r\nof time he had once raised a laugh, or on any occasion intentionally\r\ndistorted the muscles of any Honourable Member? “No Sir, the true\r\ndesign of our meeting here, is for far other purposes than those of\r\ncalling forth the risibility of Honourable Gentlemen: a risibility at\r\nany time highly improper for this house, but particularly so at this\r\ntremendous, this disgraceful moment.—It is with the highest astonishment\r\nthat I now see Gentlemen shifting their places, as if already tired of\r\npublic business, or afraid to look into the deplorable and calamitous\r\nsituation of this country: nay, so great is their inattention to their\r\nduty in P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt, that, upon my rising, I find the house almost\r\ncleared—where are the Members?—I am afraid—at dinner! Is this a time for\r\nrevelling in taverns, when the dignity of the Imperial Crown of this\r\ncountry is violated, and much harm done to our merchants?—Is this a time\r\nfor revelling, when the glory of Britannia, Sir, I say, is sullied, and\r\nwhen, Sir, the French are riding on your narrow seas.”⸺He then entered\r\ninto a copious detail of the blunders of Administration, with respect to\r\nFalkland’s Islands, the Middlesex Election, Corsica, and the massacre in\r\nSt. George’s Fields, Gibraltar, and Mr. Horne’s imprisonment; together\r\nwith cursory observations on the illegality of impressing, the bad policy\r\nof Lotteries, the fatal example of the Justitia, and the tremendous\r\nperils to this devoted country from the frequent exhibition of the\r\nBeggar’s Opera.⸺At length, returning a little closer to the question, he\r\nagain animadverted on the surprising inattention of the House: “Yet Sir,\r\n(he exclaimed) before I sit down let me ask Ministers a few questions—I\r\ndo not expect any answer from them, yet I will ask them⸺Is Dominica the\r\nonly one of our West India Islands now in the possession of France?\r\nAre we to go on for ever with the American war?—Who are our allies?—Is\r\nOmiah to pay us another visit?—Where is Sir Harry Cl[i]nt[o]n?⸺How is\r\nthe Czarina affected?—What will D’Estaign do after Christmas?⸺Where will\r\nthe Brest fleet be next summer?⸺If Ministers will not, and I know they\r\ndare not, answer these questions, then Sir, how, in God’s name, can\r\nthey refuse the papers called for by the noble Lord’s Amendment? From\r\nthose papers, I pledge myself to the house, the whole of these nefarious\r\nproceedings will be brought to light—discouraged, as I well might be,\r\nfrom again pledging my person, (having been the constant and unredeemed\r\npledge of this House, for one thing or another, for these one and\r\ntwenty years last past,) I repeat it, Sir, I will pledge the reversion\r\nof myself, that these papers will furnish us with all necessary and\r\nconstitutional information.—And, for these reasons, Sir, the Amendment\r\nmeets with my most hearty concurrence.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. V[y]n[e]r.]\r\n\r\nMr. _V[y]n[e]r_ professed himself to be one of the independant Country\r\nGentlemen, and took occasion to inform the house, that five Indiamen\r\narrived in the River Thames about six weeks ago.—He said he embraced\r\nthis earliest opportunity to repeat his offer of fifteen shillings in\r\nthe pound, if Ministers would but seriously go on with the war, which,\r\nfor his part, he now considered in a new point of view—for, as a great\r\nstatesman had once boasted to have conquered, in his time, America in\r\nGermany, so he would hope and believe, that we, in our days, might\r\nconquer France in America.—And here, from regretting the loss of that\r\ngreat statesman, he fell into a train of melancholy thoughts, which led\r\nhim insensibly to a pathetic eulogy on the memory of his dear departed\r\nfriend, the well-known Mr. _Van_.—“A long course of congenial studies (he\r\nexclaimed, with torrents of tears and frequent sobs) had entwined our\r\nhearts in political sympathy—we had but one idea between us!—Yes, Sir, I\r\nrepeat it, but one—Well therefore may I say with the Poet,\r\n\r\n    In infancy our hopes and fears\r\n      Were to each other known,\r\n    And friendship in our riper years,\r\n      Had twined our hearts in one.”\r\n\r\nHere he broke off, oppressed with a flood of tears, while a confused\r\nnoise of _encore_ and _order_ resounded from several parts of the\r\nhouse. At length, when the uproar began to subside, and Gentlemen became\r\ncollected enough to proceed on business,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hon. T. L[u]ttr[e]l.]\r\n\r\n_Hon. T. L[uttre]l_ rose, and with great solemnity, addressed himself to\r\nthe chair in the following words:⸺Notwithstanding the general silence,\r\nwhich, I find, it is the fashion for Ministers of this day not only to\r\nhold themselves, but likewise to encourage in others, on the important\r\nsubject of maritime affairs, I cannot, Sir, acquiesce in so culpable a\r\nsilence, nor content myself with sitting still, until the close of the\r\ndebate, to be numbered with the tacit votes in its disfavour. Sir, the\r\nNavy, I have ever considered not only as the true and constitutional\r\nsafe-guard of this insular territory, but as the very spirit and soul of\r\nall traffic, the quintessence of merchandize, and indeed, I may say, the\r\npalladium of commerce. With this view, Sir, my studies have ever tended\r\nto the investigation of the origin of that stupendous piece of mechanism,\r\na ship.⸺Noah, Sir, was, in my opinion, the first circumnavigator—(I beg\r\nto be understood, I mean no reflection on the memory of Sir Francis\r\nDrake)—he was therefore, Sir, justly entitled to the highest situation\r\nin the naval department of that early period—take him for all in all, we\r\nshall not look upon his like again—though, in truth, there are traits\r\nin his character not totally dissimilar to some leading features of the\r\nnoble Earl who is now at the head of that department—But it is not for me\r\nto draw the parallel.\r\n\r\nSir, The Phœnicians\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a custom also among the Chaldeans and the Nazareens\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRecollect, Sir, when news was brought to the Persians\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the Macedonians\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn like manner the Lacedemonians, and the Athenians\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus too the Carthagenians\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere let me call your attention to the Romans and Syracusians\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNeed I remind you of the northern hive, or trouble you with the Goths and\r\nVandals?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo too, Sir, the Chinese\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt length, Mr. Sp[ea]k[e]r, the Danes, Dutch, Swedes, Venetians,\r\nNeapolitans, Spaniards, French, Portuguese, Muscovites, Turks, Saracens,\r\nand others, that I skip over to avoid tediousness\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd to bring it home to our feelings, the ancient Britons, hardy Welch,\r\nMilesians, wild Irish, Saxons, Picts, Normans, English, and _Regattaites_\r\nrush upon our mind, and\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this historical deduction, I cannot but think, Sir, navigation\r\nhighly necessary, highly favourable to liberty.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, I wanted any additional reason for opposing the address, it\r\nwould best arise from the shameful neglect and inattention to those\r\nbrave and humane French officers, (particularly the Captain of the\r\nLicorne,) lately on their parole at Alresford, half of whom, indeed,\r\nministry have cruelly suffered to run away. Besides, Sir, let us advert\r\nto the wretched deficiency in our late naval equipments.⸺I have it,\r\nSir, from undoubted authority, that the several ships crews laboured\r\nunder a total deprivation of Tobacco. Tobacco! that staple commodity\r\nof our once flourishing subjects, now, alas, our avowed enemies, in\r\nVirginia, and the Southern colonies.—Sir, not only the quota of Gin\r\nwas miserably retrenched, but adultery, so congenial to the _Noah_ of\r\nthis day, pervaded every keg in the Royal Navy.—Sir, I myself know it\r\nfor a fact, that the speaking trumpet of the Albion was sent out in\r\nso wretched a condition, that, in haling a fishing-boat, (I believe\r\na cod-smack) off Scilly, the second mate cracked his pipe, and half\r\nthe crew have been hoarse ever since—some of your ships, Sir, wanted\r\ntheir complement of Chaplains:—and in others, I will not say that I\r\nknow there were not surgeons, but I will say, I do _not_ know that\r\nthere were. Sir, more fatal consequences have arisen from a strange\r\nneglect of vegetables—Potatoes, radically rotten!—Carrots, diabolically\r\ndry!—Turnips, totally tough!—Parsnips, pitifully putrid!⸺Scurvy, Sir,\r\nScurvy, like the angry Dæmon of Pestilence, has lighted up everlasting\r\nbon-fires in the blotched brows and cicatracious cheeks of your scarified\r\nseamen; so that every crew has flashed contagion, and reeked like a\r\nfloating Pest-house, with the baneful exhalations of disease.—And now,\r\nSir, that I’m on my legs, a word or two to trowzers—Such is the pitiful\r\nœconomy of Administration, such the paltry treachery of Contractors,\r\nthat, what from an original coarseness of yarn, what, from the more\r\npernicious and slovenly texture of the workmanship, not a trowzer but\r\ngaped with lacerations, whose expanded apertures discovered what⸺the\r\nP[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry decorum of this house, forbids me to reveal.\r\nSpurred on by such powerful incentives, I take this earliest occasion\r\nto give notice to the house, that I shall move, on this day fortnight,\r\nfor the house to resolve itself into a Committee, in order to take into\r\nconsideration the several weighty grievances, the outline of which I\r\nhave just now had the honour to give you a rude sketch.—When, I shall\r\nalso move you, Sir, that the several Maltsters, Distillers of Gin,\r\nVenders of Tobacco, Traders in Trowzers, Retailers of Rum, Picklers of\r\nPork, and Purveyors of Potatoes, together with their several servants,\r\nfollowers, apprentices and retainers, be ordered to attend this house _de\r\ndie in diem_, to answer all such questions and matters touching the said\r\nenquiry, as shall be put to them by the Committee so to be appointed.—In\r\nthe mean time, Sir, I shall give my hearty concurrence to the noble\r\nLord’s Amendment, as promising to afford some degree of preliminary\r\ninformation, which may tend to illustrate the more important matter in\r\nthe Enquiry which I have now proposed to set on foot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. P[e]nt[o]n.]\r\n\r\nMr. _P[e]nt[o]n_, in reply, begged pardon for troubling the house,\r\nbut hoped they would indulge him in a few words, as he felt himself\r\nparticularly called on to answer some reflections which the Honourable\r\nGentleman, who had spoke last, had thought proper to throw out against\r\nthat board where he had the honour to sit.—He said, that, at the time of\r\nthe fitting out of Mr. K[e]pp[e]l’s fleet, he had made it his business\r\nto be very much at Portsmouth, where, though it was a task exceedingly\r\nrepugnant to his private feelings and taste, he had, however, considered\r\nit as an official service incumbent on one in his department, to\r\npersonally experiment the several provisions and stores prepared for that\r\nequipment. That, impelled by such motives, he had, on several occasions,\r\ndrank the small beer, not unfrequently tasted the gin, and sometimes\r\nsmoak’d, nay chewed the tobacco; that, in his humble opinion, they were\r\nall super-excellent in their several kinds. And, as to the imputed\r\ndelinquency relative to potatoes, he could assure the house, he had\r\nbought up several tuns of the same species, for the consumption of his\r\nown family—nay, he would go further, he would venture to acquaint that\r\nhouse, that with some of those very identical potatoes, he had lately\r\nhad the happiness and honour to regale a certain Great Personage, then\r\nhis guest; a personage indeed of too high a rank to have his name even\r\nalluded to, though on so weighty, and so important a business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. B[urke].]\r\n\r\n_Mr. B[u]rke_⸺I must confess, Sir, notwithstanding my long and melancholy\r\nexperience of the present administration, I cannot hear, without\r\nastonishment, the language held forth by the speech, and echoed in this\r\nday’s debate. This session, Sir, at a period big with horror, pregnant\r\nwith ruin to this country, is ushered in with the song of triumph; and\r\nparliament are bid to rejoice at a time when nothing but the language\r\nof despair is to be heard throughout the nation. Surely, Sir, the hour\r\nis at last arrived, when humility and moderation ought to take place\r\nof pride and confidence; when, instead of launching further into a sea\r\nof troubles, we might be content to try what little can be saved from\r\nthe wreck of national honour and prosperity. Ministers might at length\r\ncondescend to tell us, what means are left to avert the gathering ruin;\r\nhow we are to tread back the mazes of error and folly, through which\r\nwe have been led; and where are the resources from which one gleam of\r\nhope might dawn upon us, in the hour of danger and despair—But, deaf to\r\nthe solemn call of occasion and necessity, they rejoice in the absence\r\nof thought, in the contempt of foresight. Like the wretch who seeks in\r\nstupefaction a momentary relief from sorrow, they sink from a voluntary\r\nintoxication into a torpid insensibility. The illusion, indeed, is not\r\nto be confined within the narrow limits of their own minds; its baneful\r\ninfluence must be circulated through every corner of the nation; and, by\r\na shameful perversion, that anxiety for the public welfare, which, in\r\ntimes like these, is, in my opinion, the highest of public virtues, must\r\nbe amused with the pageantry of domestic warfare, or lulled by the opiate\r\nof our American Gazettes. I own, Sir, even on principles of criticism,\r\nI cannot but consider the stile of these Ministerial annals, as no\r\nvery favourable criterion of the present times. In happier days, their\r\ncharacteristic was plain conciseness. Victories were then too rapid, too\r\nnumerous, to admit of a dilated relation.—Success is seldom tedious, but\r\nI am afraid our highest atchievements have amounted to no more than the\r\ninroads of savages, or the depredations of pyrates. Upon my word, Sir,\r\nthough we may censure our Officers, our Ministers at least shew some\r\ngeneralship; if they cannot deceive the enemy, they are prompt enough\r\nto mislead their countrymen; though they discover but little skill in\r\nthe arrangement of armies, they have an admirable talent in marshalling\r\nGazettes. They have given celebrity to sheep-stealing, and blazoned, in\r\nall the pompous prolixity of ostentatious phraseology, the important\r\ndepredations at—_Martha’s_ Island—Certainly, Sir, the gallant Commander\r\nof that expedition may vie in pastoral atchievements with Ajax, with\r\nJason, or at least Don Quixote; and, if he does not obtain a triumph, he\r\nis clearly entitled to an _ovation_. Not, Sir, that I mean to cast any\r\nreflection on those Officers and Soldiers to whose lot these ridiculous\r\nservices have fallen—they, no doubt, have effected every thing that the\r\nbravery of the British troops in such a situation could accomplish; but\r\nthe Hand of Nature, Sir, has thrown in their way obstacles which it\r\nwas not in the most obstinate valour, in the most consummate wisdom to\r\nsurmount. It is a want of confidence in the directors of this war that\r\nhas chilled every vein, and slackened every sinew of military enterprize.\r\nBesides, Sir, if I may be permitted to indulge a little superstition,\r\nthere is a certain fatality attending the measures of Administration:\r\nthrough all their bungling operations of war, through all their wretched\r\nplans of peace, the evil Genius, Sir, of this country, seems to haunt\r\ntheir footsteps. He it is that has suffered them to wander on, undismayed\r\nby danger, unabashed by reproaches, from one absurdity to another, ’till\r\nour blunders and our follies have at length reared that stupendous\r\nfabric of American Empire that now engrosses the attention, and claims\r\nthe wonder of mankind. Allow me, Sir, to pause for a moment, while I\r\ncontemplate this phœnomenon of modern ages, this new constellation in\r\nthe western hemisphere; a mighty and extensive empire, not rising by\r\nslow degrees and from small beginnings, but bursting forth at once into\r\nfull vigour and maturity; not cherished in the soft lap of peace and\r\ncommerce, but shaking off in its outset the long established dominion of\r\na powerful master, and thriving in the midst of carnage and desolation.\r\n“Ab ipso ducit opes animumq. bello.” If we view them in another light, as\r\ncompletely enthroned in sovereignty, as receiving embassies from distant\r\npotentates, as forming leagues with the princes and states of Europe,\r\nwe shall find more abundant matter for self-humiliation—I could wish to\r\nshut my eyes on the scene that follows: The parent baffled and depressed,\r\nimploring pardon of her injured and alienated children, yielding to\r\ntheir successful resistance, what she had denied to their prayers and\r\npetitions, and offering every concession short of a total emancipation;\r\nbut scorned and rejected in her turn, not (as she had rejected them)\r\nwith rudeness and insolence, but with firmness and with dignity; and\r\nconvinced, at length, that the day of conciliation is past, and that the\r\ngroundwork of peace can only be laid on the broad basis of equality and\r\nindependance.\r\n\r\nIs this the unconditional submission the noble Lord in the American\r\ndepartment so prodigally announced? This is indeed unconditional\r\nsubmission, but unconditional submission from Great Britain to America.\r\n\r\nGentlemen may remember how often my voice has preached peace within these\r\nwalls; how often it has warned administration to healing measures, while\r\nthe wounds of America might yet have been closed. I will still repeat it,\r\n’till the echo of this house shall be conscious of no other sound; Peace,\r\nPeace, Peace, is still my object.\r\n\r\nIt is now high time, Sir, that Gentlemen should awaken to a sense of\r\nour danger, that Parliament should discard those wretched schemes of\r\nshort-sighted policy, which cannot, in our present situation, afford even\r\na temporary refuge. As yet, we experience only the beginnings of our\r\nsorrows; but the storms of adversity are gathering fast around us, and\r\nthe vessel is still trusted to the direction of Pilots, whose ignorance\r\nand obstinacy has been manifest to all the world.⸺What thanks, Sir, to\r\nthe vigilance of our Rulers, that we are not already sunk beyond the\r\npossibility of redemption? What thanks to them, that the flower of our\r\narmy and navy, and with them all the hopes of Britain had not withered\r\nbefore the power of a lately dejected but now triumphant enemy? Is it\r\nowing to their care that the rich produce of the Western Isles has not\r\nflowed into every harbour of France?\r\n\r\nNo, Sir, it is the hand of Providence that wards off for a while the ruin\r\nof this declining empire. It is Providence alone that has preserved our\r\ngallant Admirals in America, by an almost miraculous interposition.—It is\r\ndue to Providence alone, that the heart-strings of our commerce are not\r\ncut asunder by the sword of our adversaries.\r\n\r\nI own, Sir, I cannot join in an implicit approbation of such ministers: I\r\nmust be a little better acquainted with their merits before I can place\r\nan unlimited confidence in their wisdom and discretion; that discretion\r\nwhich has led us into a labyrinth of difficulties; that wisdom that\r\ncannot find a clue for our deliverance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. D[u]nn[in]g.]\r\n\r\nMr _D[u]nn[i]ng_ said a few words, which, from the learned gentleman’s\r\nbeing particularly hoarse and uncommonly inarticulate, owing (as has\r\nbeen suggested) to a violent cold, and a multiplicity of business in\r\nWestminster-hall, we could not collect with the accuracy that we wish\r\nto observe on every occasion. His language was neat and pointed, though\r\nsomewhat tinctured with professional pedantry: his arguments seemed\r\ningenious, though perhaps too refined for the comprehension of his\r\nauditors. He had much antithesis, much verbal gingle, and many whimsical\r\nclimaxes. He talked of the competency or incompetency of the House to the\r\ndiscussion of the present question; of the materiality or immateriality\r\nof the proposed amendment; of the responsibility or irresponsibility of\r\nMinisters. He said, he neither asked, nor knew, nor cared to what the\r\npresent question might ultimately tend; but of this he was confident,\r\nthat it’s propriety was clearly evinced, and it’s necessity irrefragably\r\nproved by that opposition which purported to baffle it.—Upon the whole,\r\nhis harrangue seemed to be a medley of legal quibble and quaint humour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. S[olicito]r G[enera]l.]\r\n\r\nMr. _S[o]ll[i]c[i]t[o]r-G[e]n[e]r[a]l_, CONTRA, began with _declaring_,\r\nthat when he _tuk_ his present office, he _understud_ it to be a _General\r\nRetainer_, to _shew cause_ in behalf of Administration: That, therefore,\r\nhe hoped to be favoured with a few words by way of _replication_ to\r\nhis learned friend: That he might in this case have insisted on _want\r\nof notice_, but, for the sake of candour in practice, he would waive\r\nthat objection; for, that he had no doubt, on the merits, but that\r\n_judgment wud be given_ in his favour: _Protesting_, that the speech\r\nwas _warranted_ by _precedent_, and had _the highest authority_ in it’s\r\nsupport: _Protesting_ also, that no _gud_ objection _cud_ be made to\r\nthe address, as it strictly pursued the very words of the speech. He\r\n_justified, under an immemorial custom_, that Administration _have been\r\naccustomed to have, and still of right ought to have_, certain echoes in\r\nthis House, called _Addresses_.—He admitted, that _true it was_, there\r\nhad been some _errors in our proceedings_ with respect to America; but\r\nhe was informed, and believed, that Sir Henry Clinton intended to have\r\na _new trial_. As to the cause of Great Britain _versus_ France, he\r\nhad been given to understand and be informed, that the place in which\r\nthe _trespass_ was supposed to have been committed, was, PARCEL of\r\nthe Island of Dominica, _in parts beyond the seas_; which place said\r\nFrench, with force of arms, to wit, with ships of divers guns, drums,\r\ntrumpets, bayonets, hand grenades, and cartridge boxes, had broken and\r\nentered, _doing nevertheless as little damage on that occasion as they\r\npossibly cud_: but that he was clearly of opinion, that if the troops\r\nof said France should _traverse_ the Channel, and lay _a Venue_ in Kent\r\nor Sussex, _issue might be joined_ by the militia at Cox-Heath; and, in\r\nthat case, _afterwairds_, if verdict _shud_ be given in our favour, the\r\nadverse party would sustain heavy and exemplary _damages_.—He concluded\r\nwith _averring_, that he approved of the address in it’s present form;\r\nand that he should _demur_ to the amendment moved by the Noble _Lud_, as\r\n_multifarious, uncertain, insufficient, and informal_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr F[o]x.]\r\n\r\nMr _F[o]x_ now rose; and, with that extent of information, refined\r\nperspicuity, and vehemence of eloquence, by which he so invariably\r\ncommands the attention and admiration of the House, entered at large into\r\nthe subject of debate.\r\n\r\nTo do justice to the force of his reasoning, or elegance of his stile,\r\nis totally beyond the utmost efforts of the editor.—All that he can\r\nattempt is, to give an imperfect sketch of an inimitable original.⸺He\r\nbegan with lamenting the accomplishment of that ruin, which, from time\r\nto time, he had too justly predicted. He confessed, that little merit\r\ncould be ascribed to those prophecies; which, however chimerical and\r\nvisionary ministers had affected to consider them, were, in fact, no\r\nmore than plain deductions of what must necessarily ensue from their own\r\nmeasures. He proceeded to recapitulate the conduct of Administration\r\nsince the prorogation of Parliament; particularly observing on the\r\nimpolitic removal of the troops from Philadelphia at the moment, when, if\r\never, their continuance _there_ might have effected some good purpose.\r\nThe concealment of that intended evacuation, even from the Commissioners\r\nthemselves, was a part (he said) of that system of duplicity and\r\ndeception which pervaded the whole of ministerial conduct. Possibly,\r\nindeed, Ministers were aware, that gentlemen of high character and\r\nesteem would not have become the executive tools of a plan so wretchedly\r\nconcerted. The Commissioners therefore were not suffered to participate\r\nin counsels, which, if they had known, they must have despised. Nor was\r\nfolly more conspicuous in the origin than in the prosecution of this\r\npaltry disingenuous plan. Sir Henry Clinton, to whose courage and conduct\r\nevery praise is due, was ordered to return to New-York. Encumbered with\r\nbaggage, and pursued by an army superior in numbers, he made his way\r\nthro’ the almost impervious forests of that country; and, by almost a\r\nmiraculous effort, not only secured his retreat, but in the Jerseys had\r\nthe good fortune to resist the enemy with some success—a success however,\r\nwhich, without disparaging the British troops, must in great part be\r\nattributed to General Lee; who, in consequence of his misconduct in that\r\naffair, was immediately put in arrest, and afterwards suspended for the\r\nspace of a year.\r\n\r\nHe went on with indicating the circumstance of a fleet of Victuallers\r\nhaving been sent to Philadelphia, after the army, which was to be\r\nsupplied by that fleet, had been ordered to evacuate Philadelphia.—That\r\nfleet, he said, had narrowly escaped being taken in the Delaware; and,\r\nthence, he argued Ministers were as culpable, as if, in consequence\r\nof the capture of that fleet, the army, then arrived at New-York, had\r\nfamished for want of those provisions, on which their future subsistance\r\nwas wholly dependant.\r\n\r\nHe said, he was yet to learn what plan Administration could pretend to\r\nalledge they had followed, or meant to follow, in America. Upon what\r\ngrounds could they attempt to prosecute an _offensive_ war? Or, taking\r\nthe alternative, how can they presume to say they have acted on the\r\n_defensive_?⸺As to the first, they have thirty thousand men to conquer\r\nthe continent of America: admitting then the superiority of their army\r\nand their navy, still he contended that superiority had been, and ever\r\nmust be ineffectual and useless; because, as long as the English army and\r\nnavy co-operate, the Americans will never have the unnecessary temerity\r\nto give up the advantage of situation, or expose their cause to the\r\nhazard of one decisive engagement. The last campaign was the clearest\r\nproof of that position; and, now, though our fleet was superior to the\r\nFrench, yet D’Estaign is safe at Boston.—It was, on that principle,\r\nhe doubted not, the gallant and experienced Commanders of the last\r\ncampaign had formed their conduct: It was their policy, and, in his\r\nopinion, the best policy, to keep a collected force, and to avoid any\r\ninferior exertions, that might require a separation, or weaken that\r\nsuperiority, which, in case of a decisive action, they rightly judged\r\ncould alone have been fatal to American resistance.—It remained for\r\nGeneral Clinton to pursue a contrary policy.—Yet, though (he declared)\r\nno man in that house entertained a higher respect for the personal and\r\nprofessional merit of that able Commander, (who from his particular\r\ntalent for military enterprise, and his education under the Prince of\r\nBrunswick, was best calculated for effecting such a plan) yet, from the\r\nminutest investigation of the late Gazettes, he could not collect any\r\nvery auspicious presage of his military career. If indeed, from his\r\nobservation, of what had already happened, he might hazard an opinion of\r\nwhat may happen, we had no reason to rejoice at the revival of that plan\r\nof separation, which had proved so fatal in the Northern expedition. He\r\nwas sorry he had mentioned that expedition—It led him to a subject he\r\nwished to avoid.—He had been accused of an asperity of reflexion on the\r\nconduct of the noble Lord who planned that expedition. He would strive,\r\nin future, to overcome his indignation, by indulging his contempt for\r\nthe Adviser of it.—Yet, thus much he would say; though unhappy for this\r\ncountry, it was happy for our troops, happy for our officers, to be\r\ndirected and controlled by a Minister, to whose wisdom not even Envy\r\ncould ascribe one particle of their success, in whose imbecillity even\r\nJustice would afford them an asylum from every disgrace.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the impracticability of an offensive war in\r\nAmerica, either on the former plan of united force, or on the present\r\nseparate efforts, he recurred to the other part of his argument,\r\nwhether Administration could pretend to alledge their having adopted\r\nthe alternative, and formed even a defensive plan for America and the\r\nWest-Indies?⸺If they dared to assume that merit, how could they expect\r\nthe House to attend, with any degree of patience, to such a mockery of\r\nall truth? On any rational plan of mere defence, would they not have left\r\na force at New-York, Rhode-Island, and Halifax, fully able to prevent\r\nany attack in that quarter; at the same time, detaching a sufficient\r\nforce to protect the West-India Islands?—Upon such a plan, would not any\r\nspirited Minister have grafted some degree of activity and enterprise?\r\nWould He not have attacked Martinique, Guadaloupe, or St. Domingo? Such\r\nconduct would have struck terror to France, we should have been enriched\r\nby new acquisitions, or, at least, have prevented the disgrace of our own\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nBut, admitting that this defensive plan may have been but recently\r\nadopted, how are Administration to regain the time they have lost, or\r\nwhat resources of finance are still unexhausted to prosecute even this\r\nplan? Are all the Country Gentlemen equally disposed to devote fifteen\r\nshillings in the pound to carry on this defensive war? Are they all\r\nequally delighted with the great and growing ruin of an accumulating\r\ndebt and a decreasing revenue? Or do they rest their hopes on the wealth\r\nof our East-India trade? Do they know that, there too, the French are\r\nundermining the foundation of our commerce? Or is it studiously concealed\r\nfrom them, that the French ministry have sent Monsieur Vaugelin to\r\nCanton, in the quality of their Consul at the Chinese Court?⸺He had heard\r\nmuch of a sudden increase of national wealth by our late captures, but,\r\nat best, the prizes of privateers are a partial benefit; they can enrich\r\nbut a few individuals; they afford no diminution of the general burthens\r\nof a whole people. In the present instance, the truth was these boasted\r\nprizes were, in fact, public losses; the French having had the art to\r\ninsure their most valuable ships, particularly the Indiamen, by English\r\npolicies—besides that, several of the richest captures were actually\r\nfreighted with consignments to English merchants.\r\n\r\nBut, supposing this extraordinary spirit of bounty should become general\r\namong the Country Gentlemen, and that, to support a war which had totally\r\nlost the original object of revenue, for which they had been tempted\r\nto engage in it; supposing they were all well inclined to a land-tax\r\nof fifteen shillings in the pound, and determined to overflow the\r\nExchequer with an extraordinary redundance of profusion, yet would they\r\nbe particularly happy that all that wealth should be portioned out to\r\nsubsidise Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Hanau, Waldeck, Brandebourg-Anspach, and\r\nall the mercenaries of Germany? Or that it should wholly be devoted to\r\nsatiate the monopolising avarice of a Russian alliance? You have no force\r\nat home—you are almost defenseless.⸺\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Col. T[u]ffn[e]ll.]\r\n\r\n(Here he was called to order by Colonel Tuffnell for speaking of the\r\n_defenceless_ state of this country.) Col. _T[u]ffn[e]ll_ said, the word\r\n_defenceless_ was, to the last degree, improper and disorderly; for that\r\nhe himself had the command at Dover Castle, opposite Calais, where,\r\nthough the country all about it was rather flat, he would not wish such\r\na word as _defenceless_ to be sent from that house to Paris, by any\r\nfriend of Dr. Franklin’s. And, as he was on his legs, he must say, that\r\nword _defenceless_ was doubly wrong, from the late state of the camps;\r\nwhere, in spite of French spies, there had been the utmost discipline,\r\nunanimity, peace, and quietness; except, indeed, some desertions, much\r\nnakedness, frequent floggings, and several duels.\r\n\r\nMr. _F[o]x_ then proceeded, without any remark on this interruption;\r\nand observed, that every petty Landgrave and Margrave had already been\r\nexhausted; they had no more Chasseurs, no more mercenary boors, to\r\nfight, or rather not to fight, our battles. Russia is frozen up for\r\nsome months; and, not improbably, the courts of Berlin and Vienna would\r\nsufficiently engage her in their Bavarian contest; or, at least, not\r\nmake it adviseable for her to lessen the internal defence of a country\r\nsurrounded with such powerful armies. As to the Fleet, how could it be\r\nrecruited with sailors or marines? Though even the spirit of adventure\r\ncould instantly man every Privateer that had been fitted out, yet the\r\nnoble Lord at the head of the Admiralty had pretended to palliate his own\r\nincapacity and criminal neglect, by alledging it was almost impossible,\r\neven with an extraordinary bounty, and the utmost rigour of an Impress\r\nand an Embargo, to man the Royal Fleet—the fact was, the minds of the\r\npeople were obstinately bent against this American war; nay, even against\r\na French war, when France became the protector of America.\r\n\r\nWith such Ministers, such principles, such plans, such internal\r\nresources, such prospects of alliance; Gentlemen were now called on to\r\necho the Speech, to panegyrize an Administration too despicable for\r\nsatire, to plunge this devoted country in aggravated ruin, and, with a\r\nremorseless dispair, to _desolate_ what they had found impossible to\r\n_subdue_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord N[o]rth.]\r\n\r\nL[o]rd _N[o]rth_.[8] Mr. Sp[eake]r, at the same time that I agree with\r\nmany Gentlemen who have spoken in the course of this day’s debate, that\r\nthe present is a very serious moment of deliberation, I can by no means\r\njoin with them in thinking our situation is desperate, though, I confess,\r\nit is distressing.\r\n\r\nSir, in all cases of distress or difficulty there is some relief to be\r\nfound in comparison. Gentlemen who hear me, will admit that this country,\r\nin former wars, has been acquainted with unfortunate events. The loss\r\nof some of our possessions, and the failure of enterprizes, marked the\r\nonset of last war. Commanders were unsuccessful, perhaps criminal;—I do\r\nnot mean to draw a complete analogy between that period and the present—I\r\nonly mean to observe, that there has been no difficulty in modern\r\ntimes, from which this Country has not been able to extricate itself,\r\nwhen rouzed by a sense of its wrongs, and determined to vindicate its\r\njustice, its dignity, and its honour.⸺In saying this, I shall be told by\r\nGentlemen that we were indebted to a great Character in the midst of our\r\nmisfortunes during the last war, and that, by his vigour and enterprizing\r\ngenius, this Country was extricated from her embarrassing situation. I\r\nwill join heartily in paying that tribute of truth to his memory⸺Would\r\nto God that such a man were alive at this moment, to step forward with\r\nthe full exertion of the same zeal, and the same talents. I would yield\r\nto none as a second in the work, though I confess my inability to be\r\nemployed as a first.\r\n\r\nSir, the Honourable Gentleman who spoke last, has gone over such a\r\nvariety of ground, and has given so large a history of the wickedness\r\nof Ministers during the American war, that the asperity with which he\r\nhas delivered it, would be a sufficient reason for my silence, did I not\r\nthink it necessary, from a duty I owe to this house and to my country, to\r\ngive some answers to assertions which have fallen from him.\r\n\r\nSir,[9] to the first complaint, which the Honourable Gentleman makes,\r\nof the Minister’s concealment from the Commissioners of the removal of\r\nthe troops from Philadelphia, I shall only answer, that the importance\r\nof that proceeding required the nicest secrecy, and (though I do not\r\nmean to suggest the least idea disadvantageous to the confidence of the\r\nCommissioners) it is perhaps owing to the secret decision upon that\r\nmatter, that the removal of the fleet and army from the Delaware was\r\nso timely, and so effectually executed. And I will add, that (whatever\r\nopinions may have been conceived either by the Commissioners or any\r\nother persons) the events, which have since happened, amply justify the\r\nwisdom of the measure.⸺With respect to the bad policy, as some Gentlemen\r\nhave called it, of opening a negotiation with a retreating army, will\r\nany one tell me, that, had your army and navy been blocked up by Mons.\r\nD’Estaign’s fleet, with the prospect of all of the latter being utterly\r\ndestroyed in the Delaware, the Congress would have been more inclined to\r\ntreat with your Commissioners, than when all were safe at New-York?—Were\r\nthey inclined to negotiate with Lord H[o]we and Sir William H[o]we, (who\r\nhad sufficient powers) at Philadelphia, after the receipt of the bills,\r\nand before the arrival of the new Commissioners?⸺No, Sir—no appearances\r\nof reconciliation on the part of the Congress were shewn at that\r\ntime:—their minds, worked up by their leaders to a spirit of enthusiasm,\r\nindulged the expectation of destruction to our fleet, at least, from the\r\npowers of France.—I am free to confess, Sir, that when I heard Mons.\r\nD’Estaign had arrived in America previous to Admiral Byron, (whose fleet\r\nhad been so unfortunately dispersed) I had little hopes from the temper\r\nand inclinations of the Congress, that they would be induced to treat;\r\nuntil some blow had been struck, and that on our part, of a successful\r\nnature.—My confidence was, and still is, Sir, in the people there at\r\nlarge—groaning under the worst of all tyrannies, involved in a ruinous,\r\nand, I maintain, an unsuccessful war; and driven by their corrupted\r\nleaders into a most unnatural connection with France; I say, Sir, if\r\none spark of British sense and honour yet remains, if one drop of blood\r\nof this country still flows in the veins of the Americans, they will\r\navail themselves of our liberality, and return to their former happy and\r\nenviable subordination to this country.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Fleet of Victuallers, which, the Honourable\r\nGentleman observed, had a narrow escape from the Delaware, it was\r\nsupposed they had sailed from Corke, some time before the orders were\r\nsent from hence for the evacuation of Philadelphia; and it is very lucky\r\nthey did not sail for New-York; for, if they had, they would have met\r\nwith Monsieur D’Estaign there.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by the Honourable Gentleman, that the American war can\r\nbe no longer made offensive; and therefore, if a defensive one has been\r\nadopted, why not leave a sufficient number of troops for the defence of\r\nNew-York, Rhode-Island, Halifax, and the Floridas? and strike some blow\r\nat the French Settlements in the West-Indies.—Gentlemen will recollect\r\nthe little time that has elapsed since the evacuation of Philadelphia,\r\nthe attack and defence of Rhode-Island, and the transactions between Lord\r\nHowe’s and D’Estaign’s Fleet, and they will see how difficult it was to\r\nbe at a great many places at the same time.—With respect to Dominica,\r\nSir, the loss of it is certainly a misfortune, but, I trust, only a\r\ntemporary one. There can be no blame laid upon the Ministers for that\r\nevent, because, in the very beginning of the war with France, ships were\r\nsent sufficient to make at least a superior force to the French in the\r\nWest-Indies. I am aware of the force of the argument that will be made\r\nuse of upon this occasion—Gentlemen will say, You have so many places\r\nand possessions to guard, that many of them must be vulnerable; and\r\ntherefore it is impossible to go on in a war with France and America at\r\nthe same time, with any reasonable expectations of success.—This argument\r\nwill lead me to enter a little into what I conceive to be our actual\r\nsituation at home and abroad.—With respect to this country, Sir, it is\r\nprotected by a fleet superior to the French.—It contains, to the honour\r\nof those who have sacrificed domestic ease to public spirit, a very fine\r\narmy, including the regulars, of 50,000 men.—Your ships of trade and\r\nmerchandise have arrived safe and unmolested; whilst the Privateers and\r\nLetters of Marque have made considerable havock upon the property of our\r\nenemies.⸺And here I must remark upon two observations which have fallen\r\nfrom the Honourable Gentleman who spoke last.—The first, with respect to\r\nthe number of sailors who have entered on board these ships at a time\r\nwhen there was so much difficulty in manning the fleet, and which is\r\na charge of ignorance in obtaining them upon the Admiralty.—Sir, the\r\nbounty which has been given to seamen by individuals, to enter on board\r\nPrivateers and Letters of Marque, has been enormous—I have been told\r\n10 l.—15 l.—and 20 l. a-man.—This, with the expectation of the larger\r\nshare of prize-money received by lesser vessels, has been a sufficient\r\ninducement to men to enter on board those ships.⸺Upon the other\r\nobservation, that the prizes we have taken consist chiefly of British\r\nproperty, and are insured here—I shall only remark, that the Merchant\r\nhere who employs French shipping and French navigation, in preference\r\nto the British, ought to suffer.—But, Sir, with respect to insurance,\r\nlet us see which of the two countries suffers most on that head.—The\r\ninsurance upon French ships homeward bound has been very high.—Upon the\r\nFrench Indiamen, I have heard, so high as 75 l. per cent.—Then, Sir, this\r\nbeing the case, if the Frenchman arrives safe in France, the Englishman\r\ngets 75 l. per cent.—If he is taken, he loses but 25 l. per cent. whilst\r\nhis neighbour shares the prize entirely.—Surely, therefore, Sir, this\r\ncountry has certainly much the best of the bargain.—This, however, Sir,\r\ngreat as these advantages are, is no reason nor no inducement with me\r\nfor continuing the war.—I am obliged to recur so often to what has been\r\nsaid, that I beg pardon for deviating from the chief object, at least\r\nof my consideration—that of our actual situation at home and abroad.—I\r\nhave already said, Sir, that we are sufficiently defended by our navy\r\nand army at home.—We have certainly a greater superiority of both in\r\nNorth America—of ships in the West-Indies—superior in the East-Indies,\r\nand shall be more so when the ships now ready to proceed thither, and\r\nwith troops, are arrived there.—Sir, there is wealth, I trust there is\r\nlikewise spirit enough in this country, to support us even in a more\r\nembarrassing situation than the present. And, though Gentlemen may have\r\nwished to impeach the security of this country, I will fairly tell\r\nthem, that, such is the confidence, even in the hour of her distress,\r\nforeigners of all nations have given, and do give, the preference to our\r\nfunds;—the falling of which, immediately after the opening of the last\r\nbudget, is to be imputed entirely to the jobbing of a good purchase at\r\na low bargain, and not to a want of confidence in the nation. I could\r\ndeduce many reasons to justify me in this opinion; and I could call upon\r\nthe Dutch, as the best politicians, in support of it.—Nor, Sir, will I\r\nadmit the prospect of ruin to be before us, until I see that the justice\r\nof our cause has left us, and that there no longer exists that zeal and\r\nbravery which have distinguished the people of Great Britain, as superior\r\nto the rest of the world⸺Sir, a great deal has been said by Gentlemen\r\n(who have in my idea gone over, unnecessarily at this time, the whole\r\nof the American war) with respect to the conduct of it.⸺I believe, even\r\nthe most inveterate enemies Ministers may have, will allow that there\r\nwas transported to a greater distance, than ever was known before, the\r\nfinest army; that you fed and maintained it at that distance; and that,\r\nfrom its excellence and its superiority, you had a right to expect the\r\nmost happy advantages. So far the business, as it concerned Ministry, was\r\nwell transacted. But, Sir, then comes the question—were the plans and the\r\ndirections to execute them wise and practicable?⸺I cannot but say, Sir,\r\nfor my own part, and, as far as my Judgment went, they were so⸺I do not\r\nmean to suggest any thing invidious towards the Officers to whom commands\r\nand responsibility were delegated⸺I am not one of those who easily\r\ncondemn, certainly never will, before I have just grounds for doing so⸺If\r\nour Army and Navy have not done in every part of the world what was\r\nexpected of them—Parliament can enquire, can approve, or censure⸺This\r\nhowever appears to me but a secondary subject for our consideration.\r\n\r\nSir, much has been said with respect to the Union of France and America,\r\nand the probability there is that Spain will soon be a party in it. I\r\nwill not rob many honourable Gentlemen of the gift of prophecy, of what\r\nSpain will do in this conjuncture; but, Sir, surely her interest and her\r\npolicy should be to resist the Independance of America—She will never,\r\nby protecting rebellion in our colonies, hold out encouragement to her\r\nown to follow their example. It is idle, Sir, to indulge the idea of the\r\nSpanish settlements in South America trading with the North Americans, by\r\npurchasing, with Spanish Bullion, North American commodities. The Court\r\nof Spain is much too wise, I think, to adopt such a measure. What, Sir,\r\nmight be the consequence? An intercourse and trade between the extremes\r\nof that great quarter of the globe might at last be united by a centre,\r\nand establish the greatest dominion in the World. For, time may produce\r\ndaring and flagitious characters in that continent also, whose object it\r\nmay be to destroy the sovereignty of Spain over her Colonists—Neither can\r\nI agree with Gentlemen in thinking, that the union of America and France\r\ncan be lasting. I might as well suppose that different religions, Liberty\r\nand slavery, in short, that contrarieties can form a system, as admit\r\nthat unity and harmony can ever last between France and America—Neither\r\nof the countries expect it—The one supports, and the other receives,\r\nmerely for the temporary purpose of distressing Great Britain⸺France can\r\nhave no thoughts of establishing herself in the Heart of America. And\r\nAmerica will only avail herself of the assistance of France, until she is\r\nat peace with this Country.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, however, our exertions must be of a powerful nature\r\nto resist this unnatural alliance—And here, Sir, let me return to\r\nthe consideration of what is proper to be done in consequence of his\r\nM[ajes]ty’s speech.\r\n\r\nSir, in giving my entire approbation of what has been proposed by the\r\nHonourable Gentleman in the motion for the Address, I trust I shall be\r\nforgiven, if I submit to the House the necessity there is at this time\r\nof vigour and firmness in all our proceedings, in order to give a spirit\r\nto national exertion. And, whilst we regret that even our unanimity and\r\nliberal offers have not been productive of peaceable accommodation with\r\nAmerica, I trust that her ingratitude may yet meet with the recompence\r\nsuch a conduct has deserved: in holding out this doctrine, I mean not to\r\nforget that America is still the offspring of Great Britain: that when\r\nshe returns to her duty, she will be received with open arms, and all her\r\nfaults be buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn a word, Sir, the period is arrived, when it is no longer a question\r\nwho is to be Minister, who are to compose a party, or who have been to\r\nblame. Such discussions will not probably obtain conviction on either\r\nside—The day has passed for reflexions on those who have been alledged to\r\nhave given confidence to Insurgency, or on those who have been said to\r\nhave provoked it. The object of your consideration is now⸺the salvation\r\nof your Country.\r\n\r\nFor myself, Sir, I shall no longer desire to remain in my own situation,\r\nthan his Majesty, and this House, think I can be useful in it. If any one\r\nMan will take it from me, He will relieve me from the most anxious tasks\r\nthat any Minister probably ever experienced: But, till then, Sir, I look\r\nto the support of this house, and to that of all good Men in defending\r\nand maintaining the glory and honour of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Col. B[a]rré.]\r\n\r\nCol. _B[a]rré_ began with recounting his predictions.—I foretold in the\r\noutset of the American contest, that your obstinacy would establish\r\nindependance of the colonies. My first prophecy was, that France would\r\njoin them—was I wrong?—I will boldly hazard one prediction more—I say,\r\nSpain sooner or later will join both⸺such are the allies of America.—Who\r\nare your’s? The Onandagas, the Tuscaroras, and the Choctaws! These are\r\nyour copper coloured allies, that fix a stain on the name of Britain;\r\nand disgrace this country even in victory, as well as defeat—I knew of\r\nthese alliances, and their barbarities, so early as the 8th of June\r\nlast. I have a letter from a friend of mine at Poughkeepsie, of that\r\ndate;—the Indians, headed by Col. B[u]tl[e]r, began their rapine in\r\n_Cherry Valley_; parties of _Indians and Tories_ (so my friend couples\r\nthose blood-hounds of desolation) butchered the innocent inhabitants of\r\n_Sacandago_, and spread ruin and carnage through _Minisink_—I am sure,\r\nCol. B[u]tl[e]r, (who is indeed as gallant and amiable an Officer as\r\never I knew, and I know him well) never would have embrued his hands in\r\ninnocent blood, but that he knew he must sacrifice his feelings to the\r\nspeculative, I do not say practical, violence, of the American Secretary.\r\nGen. C[a]rlt[o]n lost the Noble Lord’s favour by his abhorrence of\r\nthe tomahawk and the scalping knife:—have not we tried those satanic\r\ninstruments of death too long? Is the whole of Miss _Macreas_ race to be\r\nsacrificed? Not one innocent babe left unbutchered to lisp out the tale\r\nof that devoted, that unhappy family? Of whom are we now to enquire for\r\nany official documents of your war? I see no Secretary of War in this\r\nhouse? Does the American Secretary monopolize and consolidate all warlike\r\nbusiness? I hope not.⸺\r\n\r\nSir, I beg pardon for the heat which I find rising within me—but the\r\ninexorable hour of vengeance is not far distant; the heavy load of black\r\nand bloody guilt will sink you all.—The time will come when the thunder\r\nof the cannon will be heard at your walls. Examples will be made. The\r\nTower and the Block must expiate the crimes of Ministers. The voice of\r\ntruth will be heard. The Rubicon is passed.⸺Sir, what is the comparative\r\nstate of the revenues of France, and of this country? Mons. Neckar, a\r\nvery able and a very amiable man, has, I understand, found taxes, and\r\nnot oppressive ones, for two years;—is that a fact?—The revenue of this\r\ncountry is diminished—it has been gradually so during this detestable\r\nwar—will Ministers deny it? Good God, Sir, what a state are we in?\r\nDominica lost!—Sir, Monsieur Bouillé was once my particular friend—Sir,\r\nhe is returned to France for fresh powers and orders—look to your\r\nWest-India settlements, callous as we are, we cannot bear the loss of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSir, I am astonished at the blind credulity of Ministry—can they be so\r\nvery simple as to trust to vague compliments against those decisive words\r\nof the Pacte de Famille, the Family Compact, “Qui attaque une couronne\r\nattaque l’autre;” (I translate for the country Gentlemen) whoever attacks\r\none crown attacks the other.⸺I know Count Almodovar—I was introduced to\r\nhim by my old friend, Don Francisco Buccarelli:—I never shall forget\r\ndining with him at a kind of Table d’Hotes, in a tavern opposite the\r\nEscurial;—as chance would have it, many more illustrious characters dined\r\nwith us that day; there was the Count, his wife’s cousin, and myself, on\r\none side of the table;—Count Cobentzel, and Baron Reidesdel (who were\r\nthen on their travels) and Duke de Chartres (who had just come from\r\nParis) sat opposite to us—Monsieur de Sartine (who came in the Duke’s\r\nvis a vis) was at the foot of the table; and we put Buccarelli in the\r\nchair⸺we had an excellent dinner—the wine was good—and we toasted the\r\nMadrid beauties in bumpers of Packeretti—however, I was not so far gone\r\nbut I can very well remember what Almodovar whispered in my ear, while\r\n_Cobentzel and Reidsdale_ were drinking Maxamilian Joseph of Bavaria’s\r\nhealth. Colonel (says he) _Il alte se volto Estremadura che molto_—I\r\nwon’t translate it. I feel the respect due to Ambassadors.—But, will\r\nMinistry answer a plain question? I put it roundly, because I ask for a\r\npositive answer—Is there no treaty now on the tapis to cede Gibraltar, or\r\nPort Mahon?—I say, the neutrality of Spain is to be trucked for by the\r\ndismembring this country of its best possessions.—Here he proceeded to\r\nread variety of Gazettes, American News-papers, two or three Treaties,\r\nletters from gallant Officers in all parts of the world; accounts of\r\nCl[i]nt[o]n’s retreat; transactions of Lord H[o]we, and Mons. D’Estaign;\r\nAlderman Oliver’s letter—affair at Rhode Island, &c. &c. &c. He went\r\nalso into a string of similar surmises, recognized various intimates\r\nin Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and interspersed the whole with\r\na multiplicity of anecdotes, proverbs, quotations, menaces and bon\r\nmots—concluding, that having then read to the house all the various\r\npapers he himself could collect, he found it necessary to give his vote\r\nfor the Amendment, as the only way to get at more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr H. St[anle]y.]\r\n\r\nMr. H. _St[anle]y_ observed, that many Gentlemen had deviated from the\r\nbusiness immediately before the house, which, in his opinion, was merely\r\nthis: Whether this house will or will not support his M[ajest]y, and the\r\nexecutive powers of government, in the endeavours to recal the Americans\r\nto obedience, and to punish the natural enemies of this country?[10] That\r\nhis own opinion was determined by a conviction of the necessity, in this\r\nhour of difficulty and distress, for exertion and firmness. Much has\r\nbeen said of the wealth and resources of France in comparison of those\r\nof England. I can only say, Sir, from all the observations I have been\r\nable to make, that France is, with respect to its finances, certainly an\r\nimpoverished country. It has not yet recovered the impression made by\r\nthe last war; and, whatever Gentlemen may think, neither Mons. Neckar\r\n(whom I very much respect) nor any other person, will be able, at least\r\nfor a great length of time, to overturn the old mode of attainment of\r\nFrench money; I mean, Sir, by the vehicle of the _Fermeurs Generaux_.\r\nIt must be a minister of great courage indeed, and a King of Terrors,\r\nthat will new model the French finances; new taxes may be imposed, but\r\nI much doubt of the collection of them. When a good contract has been\r\nlong in possession, it is too sweet to resign easily; and the _Fermeurs\r\nGenereaux_ are too important to be offended, especially, when the state\r\nis necessitated to have recourse to their assistance. In saying this, I\r\ngive full credit to Mons. Neckar for his attempt to improve the revenue\r\nof France, and that too, when the attempt is surrounded with so much\r\ndifficulty and danger.⸺The revenue of this country, Sir, has not suffered\r\nby the American war; the surpluses of the sinking fund, are as great as\r\nduring the state of perfect peace with America. Other countries have\r\ntaken from us those manufactures which we exported before with bounties\r\nto America.\r\n\r\nAs I think Britain is still equal to resist, and, I trust, to subdue all\r\nits Enemies, I am clearly for the Motion which has been proposed, and\r\nseconded, by the honourable Gentlemen, with so much credit to themselves,\r\nand with so particular a desert of the approbation of their Country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gen. C[o]n[wa]y.]\r\n\r\n_Gen. C[o]n[wa]y._ Mr. Sp[eake]r, I beg pardon for troubling the House\r\nwith one short word, Sir, at this late hour of the night, Sir, when\r\nthere are many Gentlemen very desirous⸺and much more capable than I am,\r\nof speaking—upon so material—so important—so comprehensive a business—I\r\nmay say, Sir—as that which now immediately comes before us—for our\r\ndeliberation.⸺In doing this, Sir—in offering my poor sentiments—upon this\r\nmatter, Sir⸺I own, I feel some degree of warmth, at the supineness—at the\r\ncoolness—I may say—of the Ministers in so dangerous—so hazardous—and, God\r\nknows, probably so destructive an hour⸺And, Sir, I hope I may suggest\r\nmy thoughts at so critical a period, when, indeed, all Europe and\r\nAmerica are convulsed—and shaken—by the imbecillity, the inattention,\r\nand the indecision of Ministers; who have so supinely, so cooly, and so\r\nindecisively sat _with their hands before them_, waiting for events—and\r\ncontingencies⸺In saying this, Sir,—I mean not to throw any reflexion upon\r\nany of them—Most of them I know to be men of honour and ability—but, Sir,\r\nI beg pardon, Sir, for taking up the time of the house, Sir; I think the\r\nmoment is past when any system can prevail, I mean on the part of this\r\ncountry over America. Your West-India Islands are unprotected—Dominica is\r\ngone—Who knows but Jamaica is gone too? What force have you at Antigua? I\r\nunderstand, Admiral Barrington is gone from Barbadoes. What is to become\r\nof St. Vincents and Grenada? Good God! Sir, will the Nation sit still\r\nunder these apprehensions? Have Ministers taken care of Ireland? Does\r\nthe Noble Lord underneath me know the state of Guernsey and Jersey? Will\r\nthey be able to resist Count Broglio with 50,000 men? Is your force,\r\nparticularly at Jersey, equal to resistance—Sir, at this moment, I\r\ntremble for Jersey.[11]⸺\r\n\r\nIn one short word, Sir, I beg pardon—I do trust in God, Sir ... in the\r\nKing ... Sir, and in the spirit of this unhappy Nation, Sir, that we\r\nshall be relieved from these dreadful apprehensions, and difficulties,\r\nand that we shall see once more, Peace, Harmony, and Wisdom, resume their\r\norder in this country, in the stead of weakness, irresolution, wavering\r\nfolly, absurd doubts, and indecision, Sir.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr S[aw]b[rid]ge.]\r\n\r\nMr _S[aw]b[rid]ge_⸺Example—impeachment—axes—Tower—blood—Sister\r\nMac[au]ly—republicanism—Washington, greatest man in the World—will\r\nbe heard—tyranny at Warley-Common—militia men turned to\r\nroad-pioneers—undermining trees—sand in bread—waste of powder—Middlesex\r\nelection—vast expence of flints—triennial parliaments—body politic—ill\r\nhumours—state-surgeons—example—axes—Tower—blood⸺_Da Capo_.\r\n\r\nThe question being now called for with most violent impatience, the House\r\nprepared to divide.⸺The Editor cannot but lament that the eloquence\r\nof the day is compriseable in so small a compass.—He regrets, with\r\nmany others, the silence of those who might have been supposed, from\r\nattachment, from principle, and a sense of honour, to have taken a more\r\ndecided part in the debate. Probably it might be considered too severe to\r\nimpute the conduct of those Gentlemen to the precariousness of the times,\r\nto the expectation of new Administrations, or to the fretfulness of an\r\ninsatiable avarice of wealth and power.\r\n\r\nLittle more remains to add, than that the House having become very\r\nclamorous for a division, at half past three the question on the\r\nAmendment being put, the motion was rejected by a majority of 261 to 148.\r\nTellers for the Ayes, Mr T. T[ownshe]nd and Mr B[y]ng—for the Noes, Sir\r\nG[re]y C[oope]r and Mr C[harles] T[ownshe]nd.⸺The main question being\r\nthen put, the original Address was carried in nearly the same proportion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately after the division, the H[ous]e were much astonished at Mr\r\nC[harle]s T[u]rn[e]r’s calling their attention to a most libellous,\r\nnefarious, and enormous pamphlet, entitled _Anticipation_, calculated to\r\nmisrepresent the debates, and vilify the proceedings of P[arliamen]t;\r\nobserving, that the publication of Honourable Gentlemen’s speeches\r\n_before_ they could possibly have been spoken, was infinitely more\r\ndangerous to the constitution than mistaking them after they had actually\r\nbeen delivered; as not only the public were thereby much more likely\r\nto be deceived, but many country Gentlemen were most illegally hurried\r\nup to town before the time, to the great annoyance of themselves and\r\ncattle. Besides, what struck at the very heart-strings of debate, many\r\ngood speeches were marred thereby, and Honourable Gentlemen stopt from\r\nrepeating their own words, lest they should authenticate the said\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nFor all which reasons, he humbly moved, that the Publisher of a\r\npamphlet, entitled, _Anticipation_, be immediately taken into custody\r\nby a Messenger of this House, together with all papers in his shops and\r\nwarehouses, in order that this House may be enabled to discover the\r\nAuthor or Authors of this very black conspiracy. He moved also, that the\r\nseveral statutes against forgery, coining, and uttering, knowing to\r\nbe false, forestallers, and regraters, &c. &c. be forthwith all read.\r\nAnd further⸺But, the laughter having now become intense, the remnant of\r\nhis oratory was cut short by a most clamorous repetition of _Adjourn_,\r\n_Adjourn_; so that it was impossible for the Editor to collect the result\r\nof this important motion.\r\n\r\nAnd then the House adjourned till the morning, nine of the clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] It was observed the S[peake]r was remarkable civil to the new\r\nAtt[o]rn[e]y G[e]n[e]r[a]l, as supposed upon his succeeding to that great\r\nobject of his wishes, which leaves Sir F[letche]r some chance of a Chief\r\nJusticeship and a Peerage.\r\n\r\n[2] Exempli gratiâ, for whether it is his Lordship’s Speech, or Lord J.\r\nC[a]v[e]nd[i]sh’s, or Sir W.

And certainly, no two projectors in\r\nScience were ever more strikingly contrasted: the one, like a modern\r\nPrometheus, collecting fire from vapour to inflame the terrestrial mass\r\nby its pernicious infusion: the other employing his magic _plates_ to\r\nfreeze its ardour and quench its malignity.—Happy for this country,\r\nif these professors had shifted their pursuits! as the former, could\r\nhis inclinations have been propitious to the peace of mankind, might\r\nthen have become a powerfull _Extinguisher_, while the other, however\r\nmalignant his intentions, must always have been acknowledged an\r\n_innocent_ Incendiary.\r\n\r\n[6] The Editor was furnished with copies of this speech from the Printers\r\nof the respective News Papers, many weeks ago.\r\n\r\n[7] Gentlemen were here desired by the Sp[ea]k[e]r to take their seats,\r\nand the Serjeant to clear the bar—places! places! was repeated with great\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n[8] As the Noble Lord was almost the only Speaker on the side of\r\nAdministration, the Editor felt it the duty of impartiality, after giving\r\nso many excellent speeches on the opposite side, to collect this with\r\nparticular accuracy, which he was the better enabled to do, from the\r\ndeliberate manner of its being delivered, and the respectful attention\r\nwith which it was received.\r\n\r\n[9] Here Lord N[o]rth took up Sir G[re]y C[oo]p[e]r’s notes.\r\n\r\n[10] Whilst Mr. St[anle]y was speaking, Mr. B[yn]g was making numerical\r\ncriticisms on the state of the House, which Mr. R[o]b[i]ns[o]n had done\r\nbefore, with his usual assiduity; and had taken his place at the door\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n[11] N.B.

In the debate on the opening day John Wilkes\r\nhad the temerity to say that there were only two particulars in the\r\nKing’s speech to which he could assent: “They are, that we are called\r\ntogether in a conjuncture, which demands our most serious attention, and\r\nthat a restoration of the blessings of peace ought to be our first wish”\r\n(_Parliamentary History_, XIX, 1334).\r\n\r\n_the new Attorney General._ Alexander Wedderburn (1733-1805), M.P. for\r\nBishop’s Castle; succeeded Edward Thurlow as Attorney-General, June\r\n1778; elevated to the Chief Justiceship of the Common Pleas as Baron\r\nLoughborough of Loughborough, 1780; cr.

On the\r\nthird day of the session an altercation broke out in the House of Commons\r\nbetween the two admirals, and a few days later Palliser applied to his\r\ncolleagues at the Admiralty Board for a court-martial on Keppel. After\r\na protracted trial the court declared Palliser’s charges “malicious\r\nand ill-founded.” This verdict so delighted the populace that street\r\nriots ensued in which the Admiralty was attacked and Palliser’s house\r\nin Pall-Mall was gutted.

He had a reputation for\r\nfacetious wit, and he made a practice of sending his speeches in advance\r\nto the newspapers. Wilkes was another, like Fox and Burke, who enjoyed\r\nTickell’s anticipation of his speech. Boswell reported Wilkes as saying\r\nto Tickell in April 1779: “Much obliged for your speech for me. If you’ll\r\nmake me another for next session, I’ll be damn’d if I don’t speak it”\r\n(_Private Papers of James Boswell_, XIII, 231).\r\n\r\n_Here Sir Grey Cooper caught at a pen._ Sir Grey Cooper (1726?-1801),\r\nthird Baronet; M.P. for Saltash and a Secretary of the Treasury. The\r\nallusion is to Lord North’s habit of sleeping through Whig speeches and\r\nanswering them from the notes of his favorite secretary. The following\r\nlines are from _The London Magazine_, XLVIII, 1779, 186:\r\n\r\n    Whilst B[ur]ke and B[arr]é strain their throats\r\n    The mild SIR GREY is taking notes;\r\n    And, wise as owl, is seen _composing_,\r\n    For the good Premier, who is _dozing_:\r\n    Whilst to each patriot’s loudest roar\r\n    N[or]th answers with a well-tim’d _snore_.\r\n    Till by some shriller trebles vex’d,\r\n    He discants on the _good Knight’s_ text.\r\n\r\n_magic plates._ Hartley had invented an arrangement of thin iron strips\r\nto be placed as a lining under floors and above ceilings to prevent fire.\r\nAn anonymous handbill of four quarto pages, dated July 1776 and called\r\n_An Account of Some Experiments Made with the Fire-Plates, Together\r\nwith a Description of the Manner of Application, and an Estimate of the\r\nExpence_, contains newspaper accounts of unsuccessful attempts to burn a\r\nhouse near Reading equipped with Hartley’s plates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 31\r\n\r\n_the Noble Lord, who presided in the American department._ George\r\nSackville Germain (1716-1785), called Lord George Germain, third son\r\nof the first Duke of Dorset; M.P. for East Grinstead and Secretary of\r\nState for Colonies; cr. Viscount Sackville, 1782. As minister in charge\r\nof military operations in America, Germain bore the brunt of frequent\r\nand savage onslaughts by Opposition. His famous Kentish holiday, which\r\ndelayed dispatches to Sir William Howe in New York, was long supposed\r\nto have caused Burgoyne’s defeat at Saratoga; Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice,\r\n_Life of William, Earl of Shelburne_, 1875-76, I, 358-359; but cf. Troyer\r\nSteele Anderson, _The Command of the Howe Brothers during the American\r\nRevolution_, New York, 1936, ch. xiv. Germain’s resignation was forced in\r\nJanuary 1782, two months before North’s government fell.\r\n\r\n_the Earl of Bute._ John Stuart (1713-1792), third Earl of Bute; favorite\r\nof George III in the early years of the reign; First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, 1762-63, but forced to resign on account of his unpopularity,\r\nto which the anti-Scots propaganda of Wilkes largely contributed. Lord\r\nNorth was popularly regarded as the political heir of Lord Bute.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 32\r\n\r\n_one North Briton._ George Johnstone; see last note on this page.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Laurens._ Henry Laurens (1724-1792), of South Carolina; President of\r\nCongress, 1777-78. The quoted phrases that follow are from Johnstone’s\r\nletter to Laurens, 10 June 1778, soliciting a private interview. This\r\nletter, with Laurens’ answer, was promptly made public by Congress.\r\n\r\n_Ethan Allen._ Ethan Allen (1738-1789), famous for his partisan exploits\r\nas leader of the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont; surprised and took\r\nFort Ticonderoga, May 1775; a captive in England, Canada, and New York,\r\nSeptember 1775-May 1778; author of a deistic treatise, _Reason the Only\r\nOracle of Man_, Bennington, Vermont, 1784.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Adam Ferguson._ Adam Ferguson (1723-1816), LL.D.; Professor of\r\nPneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh; secretary\r\nto the British commissioners to treat with America, 1778.\r\n\r\n_Sir John Dalrymple._ Sir John Dalrymple (1726-1810), fourth Baronet;\r\nauthor of the Tory _Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland_. _From the\r\nDissolution of the Last Parliament of Charles II until the Sea-Battle\r\noff La Hogue_, 1771, the design of which (according to Horace Walpole)\r\nwas “to degrade & blacken the brightest names in English Story, & more\r\nparticularly the Protomartyrs of the Revolution, Lord Russel & Algernon\r\nSydney” (_Satirical Poems Published Anonymously by William Mason with\r\nNotes by Horace Walpole_, ed. Paget Toynbee, Oxford, 1926, p. 115).\r\n\r\n_the great Sidney._ Algernon Sidney (1622-1683), son of the second Earl\r\nof Leicester; tried before Jeffreys and executed, December 1683, for\r\ncomplicity in the Rye House Plot to murder Charles II and the Duke of\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n_Governor Johnson._ George Johnstone (1730-1787), M.P. for Appleby;\r\nformerly Governor of West Florida; one of North’s commissioners to treat\r\nwith America; see Introduction, p. 9. His conduct as commissioner was\r\nquarrelsome, clumsy, and ineffectual; Carl Van Doren, _Secret History of\r\nthe American Revolution_, New York, 1941, pp. 96-104. Of his speech on\r\nthe opening day of the session Walpole reported:\r\n\r\n    Governor Johnston made a strange, unintelligible speech (it\r\n    was impossible for him to make a clear one without condemning\r\n    himself); he endeavoured to wipe off some of his attempt to\r\n    bribe some of the Congress, yet owned at much as he denied,\r\n    condemned and approved the march to Philadelphia, and rather\r\n    insinuated blame on Keppel than on anybody else. He was soon\r\n    after called upon in several newspapers to say, whether he did\r\n    not still retain his pay of Commissioner, though he had so long\r\n    quitted the office. He made no answer—consequently was by that\r\n    sinecure retained by the Court (_Last Journals_, II, 209).\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 33\r\n\r\n_Mons. D’Estaign._ Jean-Baptiste-Charles-Henri-Hector, Comte d’Estaing\r\n(1729-1794), French admiral in command in American waters, 1778-80.\r\n\r\n_a noble Lord opposite to me._ Richard, Lord Howe; see below, note to p.\r\n34.\r\n\r\n_D’Estaign’s fleet ought to have been attacked._ In August Howe pursued\r\nD’Estaing to Newport, but a storm prevented an engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 34\r\n\r\n_Byron’s squadron._ John Byron (1723-1786), Vice-Admiral; sailed from\r\nPlymouth with a squadron in pursuit of D’Estaing, June 1778; his ships\r\njoined Howe’s fleet piecemeal during the summer.\r\n\r\n_Lord Howe._ Richard Howe (1726-1799), fourth Viscount Howe in the\r\npeerage of Ireland; M.P. for Dartmouth; Vice-Admiral; Commander-in-Chief\r\non the North American station, 1776-78; resigned his command because of\r\ndiscontent with the ministry, September 1778; cr. an English peer, 1782,\r\nand Earl Howe, 1788.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Rigby._ Richard Rigby (1722-1788), M.P. for Tavistock and Paymaster\r\nof the Forces. Reputed to have derived immense profits from his office\r\nduring the American war, Rigby served as the model for Disraeli’s corrupt\r\npolitician of the same name in _Coningsby_, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 35\r\n\r\n_Mr. T. Townsend._ Thomas Townshend (1733-1800), nephew of the third\r\nViscount Townshend; M.P. for Whitchurch, 1754-83; cr. Baron Sydney of\r\nChislehurst, 1783, and Viscount Sydney, 1789, the city in Australia\r\nbeing named for him. He was one of the most voluble and pertinacious\r\nspeakers in debates. His contemptuous reference in the House of Commons\r\nto Johnson’s pension earned Townshend a passing glance in Goldsmith’s\r\n_Retaliation_, where Burke is said to be,\r\n\r\n    Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat\r\n    To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 36\r\n\r\n_the blunders of Administration, with respect to Falkland’s Islands, &c._\r\nTownshend views with alarm an assortment of the events, momentous and\r\ntrivial, that had agitated the public mind in the preceding decade.\r\n\r\nAs to _Falkland’s Islands_, west of the southern tip of South America, a\r\ndispute over their possession nearly brought on war between Great Britain\r\nand Spain in 1770-71. After a display of force by Spain and a demand for\r\nrestitution by the British government, diplomatic exchanges resulted in\r\na conciliation that was unpopular in England (_The Annual Register_ for\r\n1771, “History of Europe,” chs. i-v). At the request of the ministers,\r\nDr. Johnson wrote a spirited defence of their conduct, _Thoughts on the\r\nLate Transactions respecting Falkland’s Islands_, 1771.\r\n\r\nThe _Middlesex Election_ was a remarkable exploit in the career of John\r\nWilkes, who in 1768 returned from France still an outlaw for his offence\r\nin _North Briton_ No. 45, and was elected to Parliament for the county\r\nof Middlesex. Expelled before he could take his seat, he was thrice\r\nre-elected and as many times expelled. After his fourth victory at the\r\npolls Parliament declared his opponent, the ministerial candidate,\r\nduly elected. This breach of electoral rights led to street-rioting,\r\nprotracted debates in and out of Parliament, and, eventually, the\r\nformation of a Radical party. See Horace Bleackley, _Life of John\r\nWilkes_, 1917, chs. xii-xiii.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of _Corsica_ under Pasquale Paoli against the French, who had\r\npurchased the island from Genoa in 1768, won wide public sympathy in\r\nEngland. The leading advocate of British intervention in favor of the\r\nCorsicans was James Boswell. See Chauncey Brewster Tinker, _Nature’s\r\nSimple Plan_, Princeton, 1922, ch. ii.\r\n\r\nThe _massacre in St. George’s Fields_, 10 May 1768, occurred when a crowd\r\nof London citizens waiting for Wilkes to attend the opening of Parliament\r\ntaunted a detachment of foot-guards into firing on them. Several persons\r\nwere killed and about a dozen wounded. This “massacre” was the forerunner\r\nand partly the inspiration of that in King Street, Boston, two years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Horne’s imprisonment_ resulted from the zeal of that radical parson\r\nin the cause of America. The Rev. John Horne (1736-1812), afterwards\r\nHorne Tooke, wrote and circulated an advertisement for the Constitutional\r\nSociety, June 1775, stating that 100_l._ was to be raised for “the\r\nrelief of the widows, orphans, and aged parents of our beloved American\r\nfellow-subjects, who, faithful to the character of Englishmen, preferring\r\ndeath to slavery, were, for that reason only, inhumanly murdered by the\r\nking’s troops” at Lexington and Concord on the 19th of April. In July\r\n1777 Horne was brought to trial before Lord Mansfield, found guilty,\r\nand in November sentenced to a year’s imprisonment and a fine of 200_l._\r\n(_The Annual Register_ for 1777, “Appendix to the Chronicle,” pp.\r\n234-245).\r\n\r\nThe _fatal example of the Justitia_ is an allusion to the _Justitia_\r\nhulk, a convict-ship stationed at Woolwich by an act of 1776 for the\r\npurpose of dredging the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe _frequent exhibition of the Beggar’s Opera_ evidently alludes to\r\nremarks by Townshend that had excited mirth in a debate on a bill for\r\nlicensing a play-house in Birmingham, 29 April 1777. Townshend opposed\r\nthe bill because, he said,\r\n\r\n    He had heard from good authority that the theatre licensed at\r\n    Manchester, in consequence of a similar application, had done\r\n    a great deal of mischief already: nor could it be wondered\r\n    at, if we consider what pieces are sometimes represented,\r\n    which, not being new, are not subject to the controul of the\r\n    Lord Chamberlain: the Beggar’s Opera, for instance, which had\r\n    brought more unhappy people to the gallows, than any one thing\r\n    he could name. As to the country gentlemen, surely this was\r\n    not such an age of domestic retirement, but what they might\r\n    find sufficient amusement in visiting their neighbours in the\r\n    summer, without wanting to frequent a theatre.... Considering,\r\n    then, the circumstances of Birmingham as a great manufacturing\r\n    and trading town, depending on the industry and frugality of\r\n    the poorer class of people, he was of opinion it would be\r\n    highly improper to license any theatre there (_Parliamentary\r\n    History_, XIX, 202).\r\n\r\n_Is Omiah to pay us another visit?_ Omiah or Omai, a native of Otaheite\r\n(Tahiti), was brought to England in 1774 by Captain Tobias Furneaux of\r\nthe _Adventure_. As the first South Sea Islander ever seen in England,\r\nOmiah made a stir in fashionable and literary society, sat for his\r\nportrait to the most eminent artists, and was the subject of countless\r\nnewspaper paragraphs and several pamphlet poems. There are well-known\r\nlines by Cowper on Omiah in the first book of _The Task_, 1785:\r\n\r\n    The dream is past; and thou hast found again\r\n    Thy cocoas and bananas, palms and yams,\r\n    And homestall thatch’d with leaves. But hast thou found\r\n    Their former charms? And, having seen our state,\r\n    Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp\r\n    Of equipage, our gardens, and our sports,\r\n    And heard our music; are thy simple friends,\r\n    Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights,\r\n    As dear to thee as once?\r\n\r\n_Sir Harry Clinton._ Sir Henry Clinton (1738?-1795), K.B.; Major-General;\r\nsucceeded Sir William Howe as Commander-in-Chief in America, May 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 37\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vyner._ Robert Vyner (1717-1799), M.P. for Lincoln. He was, said\r\nNathaniel Wraxall, a gentleman of large property in Lincolnshire,\r\nwhose person suggested “the portraits of ‘Hudibras’” (_Historical and\r\nPosthumous Memoirs ... 1772-1784_, ed. H. B. Wheatley, 1884, V, 203).\r\n\r\n_his offer of fifteen shillings in the pound._ In a debate on the budget,\r\n3 May 1775, Vyner defended the motives of the country gentlemen in\r\nsupporting the ministers’ coercive American policy. He said, in part:\r\n\r\n    In support of such a cause ... he was willing to pay not\r\n    only 4s. but 14s. in the pound: and as he entertained not a\r\n    single doubt but we should prevail in the contest, we ought to\r\n    oblige America to pay the expence she had wantonly put us to,\r\n    and which would likewise enable us to bring back our quondam\r\n    peace establishment, that of a land-tax of 2s. in the pound\r\n    (_Parliamentary History_, XVIII, 625).\r\n\r\n_a great statesman had once boasted, &c._ William Pitt the elder, during\r\nthe Seven Years’ War.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Van._ Charles Van, prior to his death, in April 1778, M.P. for\r\nBrecon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 38\r\n\r\n_Hon. T. Luttrel._ Temple Simon Luttrell (d. 1803), third son of the\r\nfirst Earl of Carhampton; M.P. for Milborne Port. A florid orator,\r\nLuttrell was always pertinacious in debates on naval affairs. Tickell’s\r\nparody perhaps reflects an interminable speech on the state of the\r\nnavy, 11 March 1778, in which Luttrell described the timber used for\r\nship-repairs as so “singularly spungy and porous” that “your seamen ...\r\nare frequently set afloat in their hammocks, from the water soaking\r\nin, over-head, through the planks,” related an instance of a seaman’s\r\ndriving his fist, “without much pain to his knuckles,” through the hull\r\nof a man-of-war, and entered into a detail of the twenty-four invasions\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland since the Norman Conquest (_Parliamentary\r\nHistory_, XIX, 874-892).\r\n\r\n_the noble Earl who is now at the head of that department._ John Montagu\r\n(1718-1792), fourth Earl of Sandwich; First Lord of the Admiralty.\r\nSandwich was notorious for the dissoluteness of his private life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 40\r\n\r\n_Regattaites._ Not a tribe or nation, but participants in the summer\r\nregattas on the Thames. In _The Annual Register_ for 1775 appears “Some\r\nAccount of the new Entertainment, called a _Regatta_, introduced from\r\n_Venice_ into _England_, in the Course of the Year 1775,” from which the\r\nfollowing sentences are extracted:\r\n\r\n    Before five o’clock, Westminster bridge was covered with\r\n    spectators, in carriages and on foot, and men even placed\r\n    themselves in the bodies of the lamp-irons. Plans of the\r\n    regatta were sold from a shilling to a penny each, and songs\r\n    on the occasion sung, in which _Regatta_ was the rhyme for\r\n    _Ranelagh_, and _Royal Family_ echoed to _Liberty_.... Before\r\n    six o’clock it was a perfect fair on both sides the water, and\r\n    bad liquor, with short measure, was plentifully retailed....\r\n    The Thames was now a floating town. All the cutters,\r\n    sailing-boats, &c. in short, every thing, from the dung-barge\r\n    to the wherry, was in motion (“Appendix to the Chronicle,” pp.\r\n    216, 217).\r\n\r\n_the Captain of the Licorne._ The _Licorne_ frigate, encountered\r\nand detained by Admiral Keppel on the 17th of June, yielded Keppel\r\ninformation respecting the strength of the French fleet.\r\n\r\n_the wretched deficiency in our late naval equipments._ War-profiteering\r\nis not of recent origin; in the Eighteenth Century the loose organization\r\nof finance and supply in both services gave large opportunities to\r\ncontractors and commissaries. “You must not think of persuading us that\r\nyou are no gainer,” Lord Loudoun remarked to Benjamin Franklin when the\r\nlatter sought reimbursement for outlays in connection with Braddock’s\r\nexpedition in 1755; “we understand better those affairs, and know that\r\nevery one concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing\r\nit, to fill his own pockets” (Franklin, _Writings_, ed. A. H. Smyth,\r\nNew York, 1905-07, I, 430). Satirists frequently exposed this form of\r\nparasitism. Samuel Foote produced a comedy called _The Commissary_ in\r\n1765. In Sheridan’s _The Camp_, 1778, the commissary Gage supplied a\r\nregiment with lime (which he dug himself, at no expense) instead of\r\nhair-powder. It did very well, he reported, while the weather was fine,\r\nbut when a shower came up the troops’ heads were all slacked in an\r\ninstant. “I stood a near chance of being tied up to the halberts; but I\r\nexcused myself by saying, they looked only like raw recruits before; but\r\nnow they appeared like old veterans of service” (I, i).\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 42\r\n\r\n_Mr. Penton._ Henry Penton (1736-1812), M.P. for Winchester and a Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty.\r\n\r\n_a certain Great Personage._ On their tour of the militia camps at\r\nWinchester and Salisbury in September, the King and Queen “alighted at\r\nMr. Penton’s house [in Winchester], where they were waited on by the\r\nMayor and Corporation” (_The Annual Register_ for 1778, “Appendix to the\r\nChronicle,” p. 235).\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burke._ Edmund Burke (1729-1797), M.P. for Bristol. The dominant\r\ntheme of Burke’s speech, “the ruin of this declining empire” was a\r\nfavorite one among anti-ministerial orators, pamphleteers, and poets\r\nduring the Revolution. Soon after the appearance, in 1781, of the second\r\nand third volumes of Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall_, Thomas Powys, M.P. for\r\nNorthamptonshire, read extracts from that work in a debate on a motion\r\nfor putting an end to the American war. Powys ventured to say that the\r\ndescription of Rome in the Fifth Century by Mr. Gibbon,\r\n\r\n    whose enrolment in the administration was the only accession of\r\n    which his Majesty’s ministers had to boast, ... was so strong,\r\n    so expressive, so applicable, that though it was said to belong\r\n    to Rome, he could not help thinking that it alluded to a nearer\r\n    country, and a nearer period (_Parliamentary History_, XXII,\r\n    805).\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 43\r\n\r\n_the pageantry of domestic warfare._ An allusion to the vogue of the\r\nmilitia encampments as places of fashionable resort.\r\n\r\n_important depredations at—Martha’s Island._ Early in September\r\nMajor-General Grey, under orders from Sir Henry Clinton, invested\r\nMartha’s Vineyard and carried off “a considerable and most desirable\r\ncontribution, consisting of 10,000 sheep, and 300 oxen, for the public\r\nservice at New York” (_The Annual Register_ for 1779, “History of\r\nEurope,” p. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 45\r\n\r\n_Mr Dunning._ John Dunning (1731-1783), M.P. for Calne; the leading Whig\r\nlawyer in the House of Commons; cr. Baron Ashburton of Ashburton, 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 46\r\n\r\n_Mr. Sollicitor-General._ James Wallace (d. 1783), M.P. for Horsham;\r\nsucceeded Wedderburn as Solicitor-General, June 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 47\r\n\r\n_Mr Fox._ Charles James Fox (1749-1806), third son of the first Baron\r\nHolland; M.P. for Malmesbury and leader of the Opposition in the House\r\nof Commons. Either out of personal regard for Fox or at the request of\r\nLord North, Tickell does not burlesque Fox’s oratory. It is stated in the\r\nreview of _Anticipation_ in _The Town and Country Magazine_ that Fox’s\r\nspeech actually “was noticed by that gentleman in the house, who, at the\r\nsame time, lamented his incapacity of making so good an harangue upon the\r\noccasion” (XI, 1779, 45). According to a note in Horace Walpole’s copy of\r\n_Anticipation_, “Charles Fox said, ‘he has anticipated many things I have\r\nintended to say, but I shall say them nevertheless.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 48\r\n\r\n_General Lee._ Charles Lee (1731-1782), Lieutenant-Colonel in the British\r\narmy; appointed Major-General by Congress, 1775; court-martialed and\r\nsuspended from service for disobedience to orders and misbehavior before\r\nthe enemy during the battle of Monmouth Court House, June 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 49\r\n\r\n_the Prince of Brunswick._ Either Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick\r\n(1721-1792), Commander of the English and Hanoverian forces in the Seven\r\nYears’ War; or his nephew, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand (1735-1806), Hereditary\r\nPrince of Brunswick, who commanded a division in his uncle’s army.\r\nClinton served in Germany, 1760-63, acting for a time as aide-de-camp to\r\nthe Hereditary Prince.\r\n\r\n_the noble Lord who planned that expedition._ Lord George Germain; see\r\nabove, note to p. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 50\r\n\r\n_Monsieur Vaugelin._ Not further identified. The name is unusual and may\r\nbe misspelled.\r\n\r\n_Colonel Tufnell._ George Foster Tufnell.

Barré._ Isaac Barré (1726-1802), M.P. for Calne. Barré, who had\r\nserved with Wolfe in America, was a devoted friend of the colonists and\r\nin Parliament was regarded as a master of invective and the special\r\nantagonist of Lord North. North had his revenge in _Anticipation_; see\r\nIntroduction, p. 12.\r\n\r\n_the Indians, headed by Col. Butler, began their rapine in Cherry\r\nValley._ John Butler (1725-1796), Indian agent under the Johnsons in the\r\nMohawk Valley; Lieutenant-Colonel of Militia, 1768; Major in command\r\nof Butler’s Rangers, 1777. Under his leadership parties of Loyalists\r\nand their Indian allies of the Six Nations systematically harried the\r\nback settlements in New York and Pennsylvania during the Revolution.\r\nTheir raids reached a peak of frequency and destructiveness in the early\r\nsummer of 1778, the notorious “Wyoming Massacre” occurring 3-4 July.\r\nNone of the settlements mentioned by Barré had been attacked at the time\r\nhis informant is supposed to have written; but rumors were rife on the\r\nfrontier as well as at the Poughkeepsie headquarters of the Continental\r\nArmy; and the worst fears of the settlers were realized when Butler’s\r\nson, Captain Walter Butler, together with the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant,\r\nsacked the village of Cherry Valley on the 11th of November.

This incident, about which a mass\r\nof romantic legend soon grew up, proved highly embarrassing to Burgoyne\r\nand the Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE 59\r\n\r\n_no Secretary of War in this house._ “Ld Barrington [William Wildman\r\nBarrington (1717-1793), second Viscount] was out of Parliament, and no\r\nsuccessor was then appointed” (note by Horace Walpole in his copy of\r\n_Anticipation_).

Written by Richard Tickell, Esq.\r\n\r\nThis entry is from _The London Chronicle_, 23 October 1778. Though\r\nprinted in several magazines at the time of the production, the Prologue\r\nseems first to have accompanied the text of the play in John Murray’s\r\nedition of Sheridan’s _Works_, 1821, II, 161-162.\r\n\r\n    _The Camp_, “a musical entertainment,” was first performed 15\r\n    October 1778, at Drury Lane Theatre; it was first printed,\r\n    without publisher’s name, London, 1795. Sheridan’s authorship\r\n    was universally accepted by the press of the time and in the\r\n    early biographical notices of Sheridan; see R. Crompton Rhodes’\r\n    edition of Sheridan’s _Plays and Poems_, New York, 1929, II,\r\n    271. The first to question it was Tate Wilkinson, who asserted\r\n    that Sheridan “never wrote a line” of this “catchpenny for\r\n    the time” (_The Wandering Patentee_, York, 1795, IV, 124).\r\n    Later, Thomas Moore likewise thought _The Camp_ “unworthy” of\r\n    Sheridan’s genius and declared, on the evidence of a rough copy\r\n    in Tickell’s hand, that Tickell was the author (_Sheridan_, 2nd\r\n    ed., 1825, I, 264). Following Moore, some editors have omitted\r\n    it from editions of Sheridan. Library catalogues and recent\r\n    bibliographies, apparently following Walter Sichel (_Sheridan_,\r\n    I, 443), whose statements on these matters are sometimes\r\n    merely conjectures, generally assign _The Camp_ to Tickell as\r\n    “revised” by Sheridan.\r\n\r\n    A rough copy in Tickell’s hand is very inconclusive evidence of\r\n    his authorship. In view of known “catchpenny” work by Sheridan,\r\n    the alleged inferiority of _The Camp_ is still less conclusive.\r\n    Tickell may of course have contributed to the dialogue, as he\r\n    later did in many of the Drury Lane productions. But there are\r\n    no adequate grounds for denying the contemporary attribution to\r\n    Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\r\niv\r\n\r\nAnticipation: Containing the Substance of His M⸺y’s Most Gracious Speech\r\nto both H⸺s of P⸺l⸺t, on the Opening of the approaching Session, together\r\nWith a full and authentic Account of the Debate which will take Place in\r\nthe H⸺e of C⸺s, on the Motion for the Address, and the Amendment.

Reprinted in _The\r\nPamphleteer_; _Dedicated to Both Houses of Parliament_, A. J. Valpy, XIX,\r\n1822, [309]-345.\r\n\r\n    Of the numerous continuations and imitations that appeared\r\n    in the next few years, none except _Common-Place Arguments_,\r\n    1780 (no. viii, below), is by Tickell. _Opposition Mornings:\r\n    with Betty’s Remarks_, J. Wilkie, 1779, is assigned to him in\r\n    Halkett and Laing (_Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous\r\n    Literature_, new ed., Edinburgh, 1926-34, IV, 265), in Sabin\r\n    (#95797), and in library catalogues generally. Not made by\r\n    earlier bibliographers, this attribution is probably based on a\r\n    conjecture in _The Monthly Review_ that _Opposition Mornings_\r\n    might be an inferior work by Tickell (LX, 1779, 473). The tract\r\n    makes use of several of Tickell’s satirical devices of the kind\r\n    easily borrowed. But there is no good evidence that he wrote\r\n    it, and the lack of a spark of wit in the whole performance is\r\n    strong evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nv\r\n\r\nLa Cassette Verte de Monsieur de Sartine, Trouvée chez Mademoiselle Du\r\nThé.

Sabin #95793.\r\n\r\nSixième Edition, with identical title (except for change in number of\r\nedition), identical imprint and date; the text is set largely from the\r\nsame type but extended by new matter to p. 76, and there is no blank page\r\nat the end. The Cinquième Edition described above may be safely regarded\r\nas the _editio princeps_; there were, however, at least three variant\r\nissues, two of which are easily confused with the original edition. One\r\nof these corresponds exactly in imprint, pagination, and signatures with\r\nthe regular Cinquième Edition but is set from different type, has a\r\ndifferent title-page border, and uses less elaborate printer’s ornaments\r\nthroughout; it may be at once distinguished from the original by the fact\r\nthat the words “Monsieur de Sartine” in the title are printed, not in red\r\nas in the original, but in black; copies in BA, NYP. A second variant has\r\nthe same imprint as the regular Cinquième Edition, but the title-page\r\nhas a still different border, no rubrication, and the word “Cinquième”\r\nis erroneously printed with an acute instead of a grave accent; the\r\npagination is the same as that of the regular Cinquième Edition, but\r\nthe variant is a smaller octavo, the type is not the same, nor are the\r\nsignatures (regular: []², B-K⁴; variant: []², B-E⁸, F⁴); copies in NYP,\r\nYU. There is, finally, in the Yale University Library an issue called\r\nthe “Cinquieme [_sic_] édition,” with a title-page border different from\r\nany in the preceding issues, with the same pagination as the regular\r\nCinquième Edition, but from different type, with signatures[]¹, B⁸, C-I⁴\r\n(half-title doubtless wanting), and with the puzzling date “M. DCC.\r\nLXXXII.”\r\n\r\n    _La Cassette verte_ is a political and bibliographical hoax.\r\n    The text purports to be secret papers found in a dispatch-box\r\n    belonging to M. de Sartine, French Minister of Marine. (On\r\n    Mademoiselle Du Thé, i.e., Rosalie Duthé, a Parisian courtesan\r\n    who had recently visited England, see Pierre Larousse,\r\n    _Grand dictionnaire ... du XIXᵉ siècle_, Paris, 1866-90,\r\n    VI, 1447-1448.) The papers expose the motives of the French\r\n    government in aiding the United States and satirize Franklin’s\r\n    activities in Paris, English sympathizers with the American\r\n    cause, and the like. A letter supposedly written by one of\r\n    Sartine’s agents in London provides a gloss on certain passages\r\n    in _Anticipation_. I quote from the English version (no. vi,\r\n    below):\r\n\r\n      Alas! in these times, a spy’s office here is almost a sinecure:\r\n      a dozen newspapers in the morning, and as many fresh ones\r\n      every evening, rob us of all our business: a secret even in\r\n      private affairs is a prodigy in London; but as to public\r\n      matters, it is the patriot’s boast, that a free constitution\r\n      abhors secrecy: and so indeed it seems; for, not only the\r\n      minutest accounts of the army, the navy, and the taxes, but\r\n      the minister’s letters, official instructions, and in short,\r\n      every paper, the disclosure of which may serve opposition, and\r\n      tend to prejudice the ministers by a premature discovery of\r\n      their plans, are perpetually called for, and must lie on the\r\n      tables of Parliament; where, as soon as they are once brought,\r\n      their contents one way or other get into print; consequently,\r\n      ... the French ministers are not only as much in possession of\r\n      them as the English, but study them far more attentively, and\r\n      to ten times more advantage than _they_ do who called for their\r\n      disclosure in England⸺All this is bad encouragement to a spy at\r\n      London.\r\n\r\n    Bibliographically, the pamphlet raises questions that cannot be\r\n    answered with complete certainty. How is the number of variant\r\n    issues to be accounted for, and what are their relations to the\r\n    _editio princeps_? The satire was originally written by Tickell\r\n    in English and was then translated into bad French to circulate\r\n    on the Continent as propaganda against the Franco-American\r\n    alliance (see the extract from _The Monthly Review_ under the\r\n    next entry, and that from Bachaumont’s _Mémoires_ further on in\r\n    the present entry). However, the French version, purporting to\r\n    be the “Cinquième Edition,” published “A La Haye,” and “revue\r\n    & corrigée sur celles de Leipsic & d’Amsterdam,” appeared in\r\n    England earlier than the English original (_La Cassette verte_\r\n    was noticed in _The Monthly Review_ for May 1779, p. 394; _The\r\n    Green Box_ in the following month, p. 473). It seems most\r\n    likely that the regular Cinquième and the Sixième Editions\r\n    were printed on the Continent and that the variant issues were\r\n    English reprints. Typographical evidence tends to confirm this\r\n    supposition. The type and ornaments of the regular Cinquième\r\n    Edition and the Sixième seem clearly not to be English. The\r\n    variants, on the other hand, all appear to be English in\r\n    origin, and it may be noted that their less elaborate ornaments\r\n    give the impression of feeble imitation.\r\n\r\n    There is evidence that the hoax was disliked in certain high\r\n    quarters. In Louis Petit de Bachaumont’s _Mémoires secrets pour\r\n    servir à l’histoire de la republique des lettres en France_,\r\n    1780-89, appears an “Extrait d’une lettre d’Amsterdam du 22 Mai\r\n    1780,” which reads, in part:\r\n\r\n      Il a paru dans ce pays, il y a déja du tems, peut-être un an,\r\n      une brochure très courte, intitulée _la cassette verte_....

The _Epistle_\r\n    was very highly praised by the reviewers and by others, but\r\n    Horace Walpole, in a letter to Lady Ossory of 2 December 1779,\r\n    recorded an acute dissent: “Towards the end there seems some\r\n    very pretty lines; but, upon the whole, _à quoi bon? à quel\r\n    propos?_ I believe it was meant for a satire, but the author\r\n    winked, and it flashed in the pan (_Letters_, ed.

Opposition charges and ministerial replies\r\n    are provided on such topics as “Best Officers drawn from the\r\n    Service,” “The last Campaign, and State of the Nation,” and the\r\n    like, together with a section of “Miscellaneous Eloquence, or,\r\n    Collateral Rhetoric for the Gallery,” which contains the best\r\n    mimicry the tract affords.

It ran for twenty-two nights and remained the\r\n    standard stage version until after 1800. In an article entitled\r\n    “Reviving ‘The Gentle Shepherd,’” W. J. Lawrence condemned\r\n    Tickell’s alteration out of hand because “the abounding Doric\r\n    had been bled white, and new music had been substituted for\r\n    the fine old Scots melodies” (_The_ [London] _Graphic_, CVIII,\r\n    1923, 340). The music has not survived, but the discriminating\r\n    review in _The Universal Magazine_ praised Linley’s skill in\r\n    preserving the original airs while providing accompaniments for\r\n    an expanded orchestra (LXIX, 1781, 237). The dialogue, however\r\n    handled, was certain to produce disagreement, but Tickell was\r\n    more faithful to the original than previous adapters had been.\r\n    On this point James Boaden wrote:\r\n\r\n      The simple beauties of the poem were ... felt on this occasion,\r\n      and the lovers of rustic nature were obliged to Mr. Tickell for\r\n      the restoration of its original language—the _pronunciation_,\r\n      and still more the _cadence_, suffered as might be expected\r\n      from diffidence and badness of ear (_Memoirs of Mrs. Siddons_,\r\n      1827, I, 252).\r\n\r\n\r\nx\r\n\r\nSongs, Duos, Trios, Chorusses, &c., in the Comic Opera of the Carnival\r\nof Venice, as it is Performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

It was written to suit what Tickell himself, in a\r\n    letter to an aspiring playwright, called “the present taste\r\n    for complicated plot and perplexed incidents” (unpublished\r\n    letter to A. Becket, August 1781, in the Widener Collection,\r\n    Harvard College Library); for the plot, see the review in _The\r\n    Universal Magazine_, LXIX, 1781, 328. The music was provided by\r\n    Linley, and the elaborate sets and costumes by De Loutherbourg.\r\n    In particular the songs were admired: Tom Moore and Samuel\r\n    Rogers remembered and quoted them in the next century (Moore,\r\n    _Sheridan_, 2nd ed., 1825, II, 227; Rogers, _Table-Talk_, p.\r\n    72). Mary Young, in her _Memoirs of Mrs. Crouch_, 1806, said\r\n    that “Many of the songs in this piece so perfectly resemble,\r\n    in poetic beauty, those which adorn the Duenna [by Sheridan],\r\n    that they declare themselves to be the offspring of the same\r\n    Muse” (I, 127). Sheridan’s biographers have variously ascribed\r\n    the songs, in part or entirely, to him and Mrs. Sheridan, but\r\n    on what grounds save their excellence does not appear (Sichel,\r\n    _Sheridan_, I, 443, and II, 459; Rae, article on Tickell in the\r\n    _DNB_).\r\n\r\n\r\nxi\r\n\r\n[Prologue to] Variety; A Comedy, in Five Acts: as it is performed at the\r\nTheatre-Royal in Drury-Lane.

It is\r\n    characteristically Tickell’s in substance and style. Intended\r\n    as an attack on a proposed reduction of the tea-duty, it\r\n    enlarges into a satire on Pitt’s administration, especially\r\n    the ascendancy of the East India Company interest therein.\r\n    While the Company continues its corrupt sway, Pitt directs\r\n    the energies of Parliament to “Edicts against the Waste of\r\n    Wafers in Public Offices, and Registrations of the Nett\r\n    Consumption of Quills; together with Sworn Meters of Sand, and\r\n    a Comptroller-General of Blotting-Paper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nxiii\r\n\r\nContributions to _The Rolliad_.\r\n\r\n    The work known as _The Rolliad_ is only for the sake of\r\n    convenience so styled. The name serves as a collective title\r\n    for a group of many works, differently titled and separately\r\n    published, ranging from squibs a quatrain long to extended\r\n    mock-heroic poems. These collaborative Whig satires began\r\n    to appear in Henry Bate’s _Morning Herald_ late in 1784;\r\n    and the inclusive editions, issued from 1795 on under the\r\n    title of _The Rolliad_, contain _Criticisms on The Rolliad_,\r\n    _Political Eclogues_, _Probationary Odes for the Laureateship_,\r\n    and _Political Miscellanies_. Many ancillary pieces by the\r\n    same group of authors appeared in newspapers and fugitive\r\n    miscellanies but were never reprinted.\r\n\r\n    A good deal has been written in appreciation of the literary\r\n    and political satire of the _Rolliad_ pieces, but no thorough\r\n    study of their history and bibliography has been attempted.\r\n    So complex is their bibliography that it is impossible to\r\n    give a satisfactory account of any single author’s share.\r\n    The principal information on authorship will be found in\r\n    several contributions to _Notes and Queries_, 1st ser., II,\r\n    1850, and III, 1851, from copies of _The Rolliad_ annotated\r\n    by the authors or by those who knew them, as follows:\r\n    French Laurence’s notes, II, 373, and III, 129-131; George\r\n    Ellis’ notes, II, 114-115; Alexander Chalmers’ notes, II,\r\n    242; Sir James Mackintosh’s notes, III, 131. To these should\r\n    be added Sheridan’s notes in a copy used by Walter Sichel;\r\n    see his _Sheridan_, II, 87ff. There is much other scattered\r\n    information, of which full use has not yet been made, in late\r\n    eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century memoirs and journals.\r\n\r\n    According to French Laurence, who acted as editor, “the piece\r\n    first published, and the origin of all that followed,” was\r\n    the “Short Account of the Family of the Rollos, now Rolles,”\r\n    written principally by Tickell and purporting to be a genealogy\r\n    of the family of John Rolle, M.P. for Devon, the unlucky\r\n    hero of the projected mock epic. Tickell designed the absurd\r\n    family tree that served as frontispiece for _Criticisms on\r\n    The Rolliad_ (information from Sheridan, in Lord Broughton\r\n    [John Cam Hobhouse], _Recollections of a Long Life_, ed. Lady\r\n    Dorchester, 1909-11, I, 202). He had also a leading hand in\r\n    the next project of the group, the _Probationary Odes_, for\r\n    which he provided the editorial preliminaries, the first of\r\n    the trial odes, supposed to be by Sir Cecil Wray, and the\r\n    ninth, supposed to be by Nathaniel Wraxall and one of the best\r\n    in the series. (According to Mackintosh, the ninth ode was\r\n    “sketched by Canning, the Eton boy, finished by Tickell.”)\r\n    The most successful of the _Political Eclogues_, a satire on\r\n    Lord Lansdowne called _Jekyll_, was the collaborative work\r\n    of Tickell and Lord John Townshend; it first appeared as a\r\n    quarto poem published by J. Debrett, 1788. For the smaller\r\n    contributions of Tickell, which are numerous, the lists in\r\n    _Notes and Queries_ may be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nxiv\r\n\r\nA Woollen Draper’s Letter on the French Treaty, to His Friends and Fellow\r\nTradesmen All over England. “The clothiers all not able to maintain “The\r\nmany to them ’longing, have put off “The spinsters, carders, fullers,\r\nweavers.” Shakespeare’s Henry VIII.

J. Johnstone, 1828, VIII, 131). It is\r\n    assigned to a different author in Halkett and Laing (new ed.,\r\n    1926-34, VI, 252), where a copy is reported that contains a MS.\r\n    dedication signed “Lieut. J. Mackenzie.” Tickell’s statement of\r\n    authorship, the lack of any information about J. Mackenzie, and\r\n    various circumstances (too involved to detail here) relating\r\n    to Whig propagandist activity at this time, all suggest that\r\n    Lieut. J. Mackenzie is a fictitious person. As the Foxites’\r\n    chief pamphleteer Tickell did his duty, but as a member of\r\n    Brooks’s he did not care to associate his name with a sober\r\n    commercial tract.\r\n\r\n      This supposed Woollen Draper, who seems to be well acquainted\r\n      with the subject he treats, endeavours to shew his fellow\r\n      tradesmen the very great injuries to which the woollen trade is\r\n      exposed, by the commercial treaty, lately signed at Paris....\r\n      In his own style, the sample, which he hath here offered to the\r\n      Public, is well wrought, and of a good fabric (_The Monthly\r\n      Review_, LXXVI, 1787, 71).\r\n\r\n\r\nxv\r\n\r\nThe People’s Answer to the Court Pamphlet: Entitled A Short Review of\r\nthe Political State of Great Britain.

Dublin: White,\r\nByrne, Moore, and Jones, 1787.\r\n\r\n    This tract is here first assigned to Tickell. His letter to\r\n    Parr of 20 February [1787], mentioned in the preceding entry,\r\n    begins:\r\n\r\n      From some enquiries in your letter to Mrs. Sheridan, I believe\r\n      you thought it was right to answer _the Political Review_. I\r\n      mean the pamphlet that traduced the Prince of Wales and every\r\n      one else except Hastings. I now send you the answer I gave\r\n      it, because, as you thought it right it should be answered,\r\n      you will excuse faults in a paper written in a hurry (Parr,\r\n      _Works_, VIII, 131).\r\n\r\n    The pamphlet to which Tickell refers is _A Short Review of\r\n    the Political State of Great-Britain at the Commencement\r\n    of the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Eighty-Seven_,\r\n    Debrett, 1787, a collection of political portraits and cursory\r\n    observations as thin in substance as they are florid in style.\r\n    Its authorship was acknowledged in the _Posthumous Memoirs_,\r\n    1836, of Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, who told there of its immense\r\n    success upon publication: it ran through six editions in the\r\n    last ten days of January, sold 17,000 copies, and elicited a\r\n    half-dozen replies within a month (_Historical and Posthumous\r\n    Memoirs_, 1884, IV, 372-375). _The People’s Answer_ was written\r\n    from Tickell’s precise political position at this time and\r\n    displays his characteristic style.\r\n\r\n    Beginning in his usual brisk and pointed manner, Tickell\r\n    suggests that the celebrity of the _Short Review_ is due\r\n    largely to such a total want of polite wit among the supporters\r\n    of Administration “that even a Charade from one of the _King’s\r\n    Friends_ would excite ... admiration.” The author has provided\r\n    “the dull desponding train of an unlettered Court” with\r\n\r\n      a sort of handy manual for the Levee ..., lightly touching on\r\n      the topicks most in vogue, and sketching out handy sentences\r\n      for the Lords of the Bedchamber to retail, or the Maids of\r\n      Honour to scribble on their fans.\r\n\r\n    Here is the hand of the author of _The Wreath of Fashion_. In\r\n    his treatment of Pitt’s commercial treaty, his gift of mimicry\r\n    is also apparent. Tickell the elegant amateur cannot resist\r\n    parodying the style of writers on commercial subjects:\r\n\r\n      Every leaf of these motley compositions displays an epitome\r\n      of all the tricks of invitation, that are practised by the\r\n      trades they discuss; some of them intoxicating the eye, like\r\n      Vintners’ windows, with BRANDY! RUM! and BRITISH SPIRIT! in\r\n      capitals—while others denote their beaten track, and towns\r\n      of baiting; like the lettered pannels of a stage coach, in\r\n      characters of a most extensive and convincing size; as,\r\n\r\n                             HULL,\r\n                             LEEDS,\r\n                             WAKEFIELD,\r\n                             YORK,\r\n\r\n                                 or\r\n\r\n                             BOCKING,\r\n                             BRAINTREE,\r\n                             DUNMOW,\r\n                             COLCHESTER, &c.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the most amusing thing about this passage is that\r\n    Tickell is ridiculing, among others, himself, for these are\r\n    the very devices of the honest Woollen Draper’s _Letter_. The\r\n    defence of the Prince of Wales’ conduct and friends, which\r\n    occupies the later pages of _The People’s Answer_, is in a more\r\n    serious tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nxvi\r\n\r\n[Prologue to] The Fugitive: A Comedy.
