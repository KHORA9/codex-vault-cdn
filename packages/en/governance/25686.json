However,\r\nthere are actions that can be taken to improve the situation and\r\nprotect American interests.\r\n\r\nMany Americans are dissatisfied, not just with the situation in Iraq\r\nbut with the state of our political debate regarding Iraq. Our\r\npolitical leaders must build a bipartisan approach to bring a\r\nresponsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and costly war. Our\r\ncountry deserves a debate that prizes substance over rhetoric, and a\r\npolicy that is adequately funded and sustainable. The President and\r\nCongress must work together. Our leaders must be candid and forthright\r\nwith the American people in order to win their support.\r\n\r\nNo one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point\r\nwill stop sectarian warfare, growing violence, or a slide toward\r\nchaos. If current trends continue, the potential consequences are\r\nsevere. Because of the role and responsibility of the United States in\r\nIraq, and the commitments our government has made, the United States\r\nhas special obligations. Our country must address as best it can\r\nIraq's many problems. The United States has long-term relationships\r\nand interests at stake in the Middle East, and needs to stay engaged.\r\n\r\nIn this consensus report, the ten members of the Iraq Study Group\r\npresent a new approach because we believe there is a better way\r\nforward. All options have not been exhausted. We believe it is still\r\npossible to pursue different policies that can give Iraq an\r\nopportunity for a better future, combat terrorism, stabilize a\r\ncritical region of the world, and protect America's credibility,\r\ninterests, and values. Our report makes it clear that the Iraqi\r\ngovernment and the Iraqi people also must act to achieve a stable and\r\nhopeful future.\r\n\r\nWhat we recommend in this report demands a tremendous amount of\r\npolitical will and cooperation by the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of the U.S. government. It demands skillful implementation.\r\nIt demands unity of effort by government agencies. And its success\r\ndepends on the unity of the American people in a time of political\r\npolarization. Americans can and must enjoy the right of robust debate\r\nwithin a democracy. Yet U.S. foreign policy is doomed to failure--as\r\nis any course of action in Iraq--if it is not supported by a broad,\r\nsustained consensus. The aim of our report is to move our country\r\ntoward such a consensus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want to thank all those we have interviewed and those who have\r\ncontributed information and assisted the Study Group, both inside and\r\noutside the U.S. government, in Iraq, and around the world. We thank\r\nthe members of the expert working groups, and staff from the\r\nsponsoring organizations. We especially thank our colleagues on the\r\nStudy Group, who have worked with us on these difficult issues in a\r\nspirit of generosity and bipartisanship.\r\n\r\nIn presenting our report to the President, Congress, and the American\r\npeople, we dedicate it to the men and women--military and civilian--who\r\nhave served and are serving in Iraq, and to their families back\r\nhome. They have demonstrated extraordinary courage and made difficult\r\nsacrifices. Every American is indebted to them.\r\n\r\nWe also honor the many Iraqis who have sacrificed on behalf of their\r\ncountry, and the members of the Coalition Forces who have stood with\r\nus and with the people of Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames A. Baker, III      Lee H. Hamilton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nThe situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. There is no path\r\nthat can guarantee success, but the prospects can be improved.\r\n\r\nIn this report, we make a number of recommendations for actions to be\r\ntaken in Iraq, the United States, and the region. Our most important\r\nrecommendations call for new and enhanced diplomatic and political\r\nefforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary mission of\r\nU.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to\r\nmove its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly. We believe that these\r\ntwo recommendations are equally important and reinforce one another.\r\nIf they are effectively implemented, and if the Iraqi government moves\r\nforward with national reconciliation, Iraqis will have an opportunity\r\nfor a better future, terrorism will be dealt a blow, stability will be\r\nenhanced in an important part of the world, and America's credibility,\r\ninterests, and values will be protected.\r\n\r\nThe challenges in Iraq are complex. Violence is increasing in scope\r\nand lethality. It is fed by a Sunni Arab insurgency, Shiite militias\r\nand death squads, al Qaeda, and widespread criminality. Sectarian\r\nconflict is the principal challenge to stability. The Iraqi people\r\nhave a democratically elected government, yet it is not adequately\r\nadvancing national reconciliation, providing basic security, or\r\ndelivering essential services. Pessimism is pervasive.\r\n\r\nIf the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences could be\r\nsevere. A slide toward chaos could trigger the collapse of Iraq's\r\ngovernment and a humanitarian catastrophe. Neighboring countries could\r\nintervene. Sunni-Shia clashes could spread. Al Qaeda could win a\r\npropaganda victory and expand its base of operations. The global\r\nstanding of the United States could be diminished. Americans could\r\nbecome more polarized.\r\n\r\nDuring the past nine months we have considered a full range of\r\napproaches for moving forward. All have flaws. Our recommended course\r\nhas shortcomings, but we firmly believe that it includes the best\r\nstrategies and tactics to positively influence the outcome in Iraq and\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal Approach\r\n\r\nThe policies and actions of Iraq's neighbors greatly affect its\r\nstability and prosperity. No country in the region will benefit in the\r\nlong term from a chaotic Iraq. Yet Iraq's neighbors are not doing\r\nenough to help Iraq achieve stability. Some are undercutting\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nThe United States should immediately launch a new diplomatic offensive\r\nto build an international consensus for stability in Iraq and the\r\nregion. This diplomatic effort should include every country that has\r\nan interest in avoiding a chaotic Iraq, including all of Iraq's\r\nneighbors. Iraq's neighbors and key states in and outside the region\r\nshould form a support group to reinforce security and national\r\nreconciliation within Iraq, neither of which Iraq can achieve on its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nGiven the ability of Iran and Syria to influence events within Iraq\r\nand their interest in avoiding chaos in Iraq, the United States should\r\ntry to engage them constructively. In seeking to influence the\r\nbehavior of both countries, the United States has disincentives and\r\nincentives available. Iran should stem the flow of arms and training\r\nto Iraq, respect Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and use\r\nits influence over Iraqi Shia groups to encourage national\r\nreconciliation. The issue of Iran's nuclear programs should continue\r\nto be dealt with by the five permanent members of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council plus Germany. Syria should control its border with\r\nIraq to stem the flow of funding, insurgents, and terrorists in and\r\nout of Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe United States cannot achieve its goals in the Middle East unless\r\nit deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict and regional\r\ninstability. There must be a renewed and sustained commitment by the\r\nUnited States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts:\r\nLebanon, Syria, and President Bush's June 2002 commitment to a two-state\r\nsolution for Israel and Palestine. This commitment must include\r\ndirect talks with, by, and between Israel, Lebanon, Palestinians\r\n(those who accept Israel's right to exist), and Syria.\r\n\r\nAs the United States develops its approach toward Iraq and the Middle\r\nEast, the United States should provide additional political, economic,\r\nand military support for Afghanistan, including resources that might\r\nbecome available as combat forces are moved out of Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Approach\r\n\r\nThe most important questions about Iraq's future are now the\r\nresponsibility of Iraqis. The United States must adjust its role in\r\nIraq to encourage the Iraqi people to take control of their own\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi government should accelerate assuming responsibility for\r\nIraqi security by increasing the number and quality of Iraqi Army\r\nbrigades. While this process is under way, and to facilitate it, the\r\nUnited States should significantly increase the number of U.S.\r\nmilitary personnel, including combat troops, imbedded in and\r\nsupporting Iraqi Army units. As these actions proceed, U.S. combat\r\nforces could begin to move out of Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of\r\nsupporting the Iraqi army, which would take over primary\r\nresponsibility for combat operations. By the first quarter of 2008,\r\nsubject to unexpected developments in the security situation on the\r\nground, all combat brigades not necessary for force protection could\r\nbe out of Iraq. At that time, U.S. combat forces in Iraq could be\r\ndeployed only in units embedded with Iraqi forces, in rapid-reaction\r\nand special operations teams, and in training, equipping, advising,\r\nforce protection, and search and rescue. Intelligence and support\r\nefforts would continue. A vital mission of those rapid reaction and\r\nspecial operations forces would be to undertake strikes against al\r\nQaeda in Iraq.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Iraqi government will need assistance from the\r\nUnited States for some time to come, especially in carrying out\r\nsecurity responsibilities. Yet the United States must make it clear to\r\nthe Iraqi government that the United States could carry out its plans,\r\nincluding planned redeployments, even if the Iraqi government did not\r\nimplement their planned changes. The United States must not make an\r\nopen-ended commitment to keep large numbers of American troops\r\ndeployed in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAs redeployment proceeds, military leaders should emphasize training\r\nand education of forces that have returned to the United States in\r\norder to restore the force to full combat capability. As equipment\r\nreturns to the United States, Congress should appropriate sufficient\r\nfunds to restore the equipment over the next five years.\r\n\r\nThe United States should work closely with Iraq's leaders to support\r\nthe achievement of specific objectives--or milestones--on national\r\nreconciliation, security, and governance. Miracles cannot be expected,\r\nbut the people of Iraq have the right to expect action and progress.\r\nThe Iraqi government needs to show its own citizens--and the citizens\r\nof the United States and other countries--that it deserves continued\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, in consultation with the United\r\nStates, has put forward a set of milestones critical for Iraq. His\r\nlist is a good start, but it must be expanded to include milestones\r\nthat can strengthen the government and benefit the Iraqi people.\r\nPresident Bush and his national security team should remain in close\r\nand frequent contact with the Iraqi leadership to convey a clear\r\nmessage: there must be prompt action by the Iraqi government to make\r\nsubstantial progress toward the achievement of these milestones.\r\n\r\nIf the Iraqi government demonstrates political will and makes\r\nsubstantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national\r\nreconciliation, security, and governance, the United States should\r\nmake clear its willingness to continue training, assistance, and\r\nsupport for Iraq's security forces and to continue political,\r\nmilitary, and economic support. If the Iraqi government does not make\r\nsubstantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national\r\nreconciliation, security, and governance, the United States should\r\nreduce its political, military, or economic support for the Iraqi\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOur report makes recommendations in several other areas. They include\r\nimprovements to the Iraqi criminal justice system, the Iraqi oil\r\nsector, the U.S. reconstruction efforts in Iraq, the U.S. budget\r\nprocess, the training of U.S. government personnel, and U.S.\r\nintelligence capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIt is the unanimous view of the Iraq Study Group that these\r\nrecommendations offer a new way forward for the United States in Iraq\r\nand the region. They are comprehensive and need to be implemented in a\r\ncoordinated fashion. They should not be separated or carried out in\r\nisolation. The dynamics of the region are as important to Iraq as\r\nevents within Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe challenges are daunting. There will be difficult days ahead. But\r\nby pursuing this new way forward, Iraq, the region, and the United\r\nStates of America can emerge stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee for success in Iraq. The situation in Baghdad\r\nand several provinces is dire. Saddam Hussein has been removed from\r\npower and the Iraqi people have a democratically elected government\r\nthat is broadly representative of Iraq's population, yet the\r\ngovernment is not adequately advancing national reconciliation,\r\nproviding basic security, or delivering essential services. The level\r\nof violence is high and growing. There is great suffering, and the\r\ndaily lives of many Iraqis show little or no improvement. Pessimism is\r\npervasive.\r\n\r\nU.S. military and civilian personnel, and our coalition partners, are\r\nmaking exceptional and dedicated efforts--and sacrifices--to help\r\nIraq. Many Iraqis have also made extraordinary efforts and sacrifices\r\nfor a better future. However, the ability of the United States to\r\ninfluence events within Iraq is diminishing. Many Iraqis are embracing\r\nsectarian identities. The lack of security impedes economic\r\ndevelopment. Most countries in the region are not playing a\r\nconstructive role in support of Iraq, and some are undercutting\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nIraq is vital to regional and even global stability, and is critical\r\nto U.S. interests. It runs along the sectarian fault lines of Shia and\r\nSunni Islam, and of Kurdish and Arab populations. It has the world's\r\nsecond-largest known oil reserves. It is now a base of operations for\r\ninternational terrorism, including al Qaeda.\r\n\r\nIraq is a centerpiece of American foreign policy, influencing how the\r\nUnited States is viewed in the region and around the world. Because of\r\nthe gravity of Iraq's condition and the country's vital importance,\r\nthe United States is facing one of its most difficult and significant\r\ninternational challenges in decades. Because events in Iraq have been\r\nset in motion by American decisions and actions, the United States has\r\nboth a national and a moral interest in doing what it can to give\r\nIraqis an opportunity to avert anarchy.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the security, political, economic, and regional\r\nsituation follows (all figures current as of publication), along with\r\nan assessment of the consequences if Iraq continues to deteriorate,\r\nand an analysis of some possible courses of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Assessment of the Current Situation in Iraq\r\n\r\n1. Security\r\n\r\nAttacks against U.S., Coalition, and Iraqi security forces are\r\npersistent and growing. October 2006 was the deadliest month for U.S.\r\nforces since January 2005, with 102 Americans killed. Total attacks in\r\nOctober 2006 averaged 180 per day, up from 70 per day in January 2006.\r\nDaily attacks against Iraqi security forces in October were more than\r\ndouble the level in January. Attacks against civilians in October were\r\nfour times higher than in January. Some 3,000 Iraqi civilians are\r\nkilled every month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSources of Violence\r\n\r\nViolence is increasing in scope, complexity, and lethality. There are\r\nmultiple sources of violence in Iraq: the Sunni Arab insurgency, al\r\nQaeda and affiliated jihadist groups, Shiite militias and death\r\nsquads, and organized criminality. Sectarian violence--particularly in\r\nand around Baghdad--has become the principal challenge to stability.\r\n\r\nMost attacks on Americans still come from the Sunni Arab insurgency.\r\nThe insurgency comprises former elements of the Saddam Hussein regime,\r\ndisaffected Sunni Arab Iraqis, and common criminals. It has\r\nsignificant support within the Sunni Arab community. The insurgency\r\nhas no single leadership but is a network of networks. It benefits\r\nfrom participants' detailed knowledge of Iraq's infrastructure, and\r\narms and financing are supplied primarily from within Iraq. The\r\ninsurgents have different goals, although nearly all oppose the\r\npresence of U.S. forces in Iraq. Most wish to restore Sunni Arab rule\r\nin the country. Some aim at winning local power and control.\r\n\r\nAl Qaeda is responsible for a small portion of the violence in Iraq,\r\nbut that includes some of the more spectacular acts: suicide attacks,\r\nlarge truck bombs, and attacks on significant religious or political\r\ntargets. Al Qaeda in Iraq is now largely Iraqi-run and composed of\r\nSunni Arabs. Foreign fighters--numbering an estimated 1,300--play a\r\nsupporting role or carry out suicide operations. Al Qaeda's goals\r\ninclude instigating a wider sectarian war between Iraq's Sunni and\r\nShia, and driving the United States out of Iraq.\r\n\r\nSectarian violence causes the largest number of Iraqi civilian\r\ncasualties. Iraq is in the grip of a deadly cycle: Sunni insurgent\r\nattacks spark large-scale Shia reprisals, and vice versa. Groups of\r\nIraqis are often found bound and executed, their bodies dumped in\r\nrivers or fields. The perception of unchecked violence emboldens\r\nmilitias, shakes confidence in the government, and leads Iraqis to\r\nflee to places where their sect is the majority and where they feel\r\nthey are in less danger. In some parts of Iraq--notably in\r\nBaghdad--sectarian cleansing is taking place. The United Nations\r\nestimates that 1.6 million are displaced within Iraq, and up to 1.8\r\nmillion Iraqis have fled the country.\r\n\r\nShiite militias engaging in sectarian violence pose a substantial\r\nthreat to immediate and long-term stability. These militias are\r\ndiverse. Some are affiliated with the government, some are highly\r\nlocalized, and some are wholly outside the law. They are fragmenting,\r\nwith an increasing breakdown in command structure. The militias target\r\nSunni Arab civilians, and some struggle for power in clashes with one\r\nanother. Some even target government ministries. They undermine the\r\nauthority of the Iraqi government and security forces, as well as the\r\nability of Sunnis to join a peaceful political process. The prevalence\r\nof militias sends a powerful message: political leaders can preserve\r\nand expand their power only if backed by armed force.\r\n\r\nThe Mahdi Army, led by Moqtada al-Sadr, may number as many as 60,000\r\nfighters. It has directly challenged U.S. and Iraqi government forces,\r\nand it is widely believed to engage in regular violence against Sunni\r\nArab civilians. Mahdi fighters patrol certain Shia enclaves, notably\r\nnortheast Baghdad's teeming neighborhood of 2.5 million known as \"Sadr\r\nCity.\" As the Mahdi Army has grown in size and influence, some\r\nelements have moved beyond Sadr's control.\r\n\r\nThe Badr Brigade is affiliated with the Supreme Council for the\r\nIslamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), which is led by Abdul Aziz\r\nal-Hakim. The Badr Brigade has long-standing ties with the Iranian\r\nRevolutionary Guard Corps. Many Badr members have become integrated\r\ninto the Iraqi police, and others play policing roles in southern\r\nIraqi cities. While wearing the uniform of the security services, Badr\r\nfighters have targeted Sunni Arab civilians. Badr fighters have also\r\nclashed with the Mahdi Army, particularly in southern Iraq.\r\n\r\nCriminality also makes daily life unbearable for many Iraqis.\r\nRobberies, kidnappings, and murder are commonplace in much of the\r\ncountry. Organized criminal rackets thrive, particularly in unstable\r\nareas like Anbar province. Some criminal gangs cooperate with,\r\nfinance, or purport to be part of the Sunni insurgency or a Shiite\r\nmilitia in order to gain legitimacy. As one knowledgeable American\r\nofficial put it, \"If there were foreign forces in New Jersey, Tony\r\nSoprano would be an insurgent leader.\"\r\n\r\nFour of Iraq's eighteen provinces are highly insecure--Baghdad, Anbar,\r\nDiyala, and Salah ad Din. These provinces account for about 40 percent\r\nof Iraq's population of 26 million. In Baghdad, the violence is\r\nlargely between Sunni and Shia. In Anbar, the violence is attributable\r\nto the Sunni insurgency and to al Qaeda, and the situation is\r\ndeteriorating.\r\n\r\nIn Kirkuk, the struggle is between Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmen. In Basra\r\nand the south, the violence is largely an intra-Shia power struggle.\r\nThe most stable parts of the country are the three provinces of the\r\nKurdish north and parts of the Shia south. However, most of Iraq's\r\ncities have a sectarian mix and are plagued by persistent violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S., Coalition, and Iraqi Forces\r\n\r\nConfronting this violence are the Multi-National Forces-Iraq under\r\nU.S. command, working in concert with Iraq's security forces. The\r\nMulti-National Forces-Iraq were authorized by UN Security Council\r\nResolution 1546 in 2004, and the mandate was extended in November 2006\r\nfor another year.\r\n\r\nApproximately 141,000 U.S. military personnel are serving in Iraq,\r\ntogether with approximately 16,500 military personnel from twenty-seven\r\ncoalition partners, the largest contingent being 7,200 from the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The U.S. Army has principal responsibility for Baghdad\r\nand the north. The U.S. Marine Corps takes the lead in Anbar province.\r\nThe United Kingdom has responsibility in the southeast, chiefly in\r\nBasra.\r\n\r\nAlong with this military presence, the United States is building its\r\nlargest embassy in Baghdad. The current U.S. embassy in Baghdad totals\r\nabout 1,000 U.S. government employees. There are roughly 5,000\r\ncivilian contractors in the country.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the U.S. military rarely engages in large-scale combat\r\noperations. Instead, counterinsurgency efforts focus on a strategy of\r\n\"clear, hold, and build\"--\"clearing\" areas of insurgents and death\r\nsquads, \"holding\" those areas with Iraqi security forces, and\r\n\"building\" areas with quick-impact reconstruction projects.\r\n\r\nNearly every U.S. Army and Marine combat unit, and several National\r\nGuard and Reserve units, have been to Iraq at least once. Many are on\r\ntheir second or even third rotations; rotations are typically one year\r\nfor Army units, seven months for Marine units. Regular rotations, in\r\nand out of Iraq or within the country, complicate brigade and\r\nbattalion efforts to get to know the local scene, earn the trust of\r\nthe population, and build a sense of cooperation.\r\n\r\nMany military units are under significant strain. Because the harsh\r\nconditions in Iraq are wearing out equipment more quickly than\r\nanticipated, many units do not have fully functional equipment for\r\ntraining when they redeploy to the United States. An extraordinary\r\namount of sacrifice has been asked of our men and women in uniform,\r\nand of their families. The American military has little reserve force\r\nto call on if it needs ground forces to respond to other crises around\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nA primary mission of U.S. military strategy in Iraq is the training of\r\ncompetent Iraqi security forces. By the end of 2006, the Multi-National\r\nSecurity Transition Command-Iraq under American leadership is\r\nexpected to have trained and equipped a target number of approximately\r\n326,000 Iraqi security services. That figure includes 138,000 members\r\nof the Iraqi Army and 188,000 Iraqi police. Iraqis have operational\r\ncontrol over roughly one-third of Iraqi security forces; the U.S. has\r\noperational control over most of the rest. No U.S. forces are under\r\nIraqi command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi Army\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi Army is making fitful progress toward becoming a reliable\r\nand disciplined fighting force loyal to the national government. By\r\nthe end of 2006, the Iraqi Army is expected to comprise 118 battalions\r\nformed into 36 brigades under the command of 10 divisions. Although\r\nthe Army is one of the more professional Iraqi institutions, its\r\nperformance has been uneven. The training numbers are impressive, but\r\nthey represent only part of the story.\r\n\r\nSignificant questions remain about the ethnic composition and\r\nloyalties of some Iraqi units--specifically, whether they will carry\r\nout missions on behalf of national goals instead of a sectarian\r\nagenda. Of Iraq's 10 planned divisions, those that are even-numbered\r\nare made up of Iraqis who signed up to serve in a specific area, and\r\nthey have been reluctant to redeploy to other areas of the country. As\r\na result, elements of the Army have refused to carry out missions.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi Army is also confronted by several other significant\r\nchallenges:\r\n\r\n--Units lack leadership. They lack the ability to work together and\r\nperform at higher levels of organization--the brigade and division\r\nlevel. Leadership training and the experience of leadership are the\r\nessential elements to improve performance.\r\n\r\n--Units lack equipment. They cannot carry out their missions without\r\nadequate equipment. Congress has been generous in funding requests for\r\nU.S. troops, but it has resisted fully funding Iraqi forces. The\r\nentire appropriation for Iraqi defense forces for FY 2006 ($3 billion)\r\nis less than the United States currently spends in Iraq every two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n--Units lack personnel. Soldiers are on leave one week a month so that\r\nthey can visit their families and take them their pay. Soldiers are\r\npaid in cash because there is no banking system. Soldiers are given\r\nleave liberally and face no penalties for absence without leave. Unit\r\nreadiness rates are low, often at 50 percent or less.\r\n\r\n--Units lack logistics and support. They lack the ability to sustain\r\ntheir operations, the capability to transport supplies and troops, and\r\nthe capacity to provide their own indirect fire support, close-air\r\nsupport, technical intelligence, and medical evacuation. They will\r\ndepend on the United States for logistics and support through at least\r\n2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi Police\r\n\r\nThe state of the Iraqi police is substantially worse than that of the\r\nIraqi Army. The Iraqi Police Service currently numbers roughly 135,000\r\nand is responsible for local policing. It has neither the training nor\r\nlegal authority to conduct criminal investigations, nor the firepower\r\nto take on organized crime, insurgents, or militias. The Iraqi\r\nNational Police numbers roughly 25,000 and its officers have been\r\ntrained in counterinsurgency operations, not police work. The Border\r\nEnforcement Department numbers roughly 28,000.\r\n\r\nIraqi police cannot control crime, and they routinely engage in\r\nsectarian violence, including the unnecessary detention, torture, and\r\ntargeted execution of Sunni Arab civilians. The police are organized\r\nunder the Ministry of the Interior, which is confronted by corruption\r\nand militia infiltration and lacks control over police in the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe United States and the Iraqi government recognize the importance of\r\nreform. The current Minister of the Interior has called for purging\r\nmilitia members and criminals from the police. But he has little\r\npolice experience or base of support. There is no clear Iraqi or U.S.\r\nagreement on the character and mission of the police. U.S. authorities\r\ndo not know with precision the composition and membership of the\r\nvarious police forces, nor the disposition of their funds and\r\nequipment. There are ample reports of Iraqi police officers\r\nparticipating in training in order to obtain a weapon, uniform, and\r\nammunition for use in sectarian violence. Some are on the payroll but\r\ndon't show up for work. In the words of a senior American general,\r\n\"2006 was supposed to be 'the year of the police' but it hasn't\r\nmaterialized that way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacilities Protection Services\r\n\r\nThe Facilities Protection Service poses additional problems. Each\r\nIraqi ministry has an armed unit, ostensibly to guard the ministry's\r\ninfrastructure. All together, these units total roughly 145,000\r\nuniformed Iraqis under arms. However, these units have questionable\r\nloyalties and capabilities. In the ministries of Health, Agriculture,\r\nand Transportation--controlled by Moqtada al-Sadr--the Facilities\r\nProtection Service is a source of funding and jobs for the Mahdi Army.\r\nOne senior U.S. official described the Facilities Protection Service\r\nas \"incompetent, dysfunctional, or subversive.\" Several Iraqis simply\r\nreferred to them as militias.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi government has begun to bring the Facilities Protection\r\nService under the control of the Interior Ministry. The intention is\r\nto identify and register Facilities Protection personnel, standardize\r\ntheir treatment, and provide some training. Though the approach is\r\nreasonable, this effort may exceed the current capability of the\r\nInterior Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperation Together Forward II\r\n\r\nIn a major effort to quell the violence in Iraq, U.S. military forces\r\njoined with Iraqi forces to establish security in Baghdad with an\r\noperation called \"Operation Together Forward II,\" which began in\r\nAugust 2006. Under Operation Together Forward II, U.S. forces are\r\nworking with members of the Iraqi Army and police to \"clear, hold, and\r\nbuild\" in Baghdad, moving neighborhood by neighborhood. There are\r\nroughly 15,000 U.S. troops in Baghdad.\r\n\r\nThis operation--and the security of Baghdad--is crucial to security in\r\nIraq more generally. A capital city of more than 6 million, Baghdad\r\ncontains some 25 percent of the country's population. It is the\r\nlargest Sunni and Shia city in Iraq. It has high concentrations of\r\nboth Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias. Both Iraqi and American\r\nleaders told us that as Baghdad goes, so goes Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe results of Operation Together Forward II are disheartening.\r\nViolence in Baghdad--already at high levels--jumped more than 43\r\npercent between the summer and October 2006. U.S. forces continue to\r\nsuffer high casualties. Perpetrators of violence leave neighborhoods\r\nin advance of security sweeps, only to filter back later. Iraqi police\r\nhave been unable or unwilling to stop such infiltration and continuing\r\nviolence. The Iraqi Army has provided only two out of the six\r\nbattalions that it promised in August would join American forces in\r\nBaghdad. The Iraqi government has rejected sustained security\r\noperations in Sadr City.\r\n\r\nSecurity efforts will fail unless the Iraqis have both the capability\r\nto hold areas that have been cleared and the will to clear\r\nneighborhoods that are home to Shiite militias. U.S. forces can\r\n\"clear\" any neighborhood, but there are neither enough U.S. troops\r\npresent nor enough support from Iraqi security forces to \"hold\"\r\nneighborhoods so cleared. The same holds true for the rest of Iraq.\r\nBecause none of the operations conducted by U.S. and Iraqi military\r\nforces are fundamentally changing the conditions encouraging the\r\nsectarian violence, U.S. forces seem to be caught in a mission that\r\nhas no foreseeable end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Politics\r\n\r\nIraq is a sovereign state with a democratically elected Council of\r\nRepresentatives. A government of national unity was formed in May 2006\r\nthat is broadly representative of the Iraqi people. Iraq has ratified\r\na constitution, and--per agreement with Sunni Arab leaders--has\r\ninitiated a process of review to determine if the constitution needs\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Iraqi government is basically sectarian, and\r\nkey players within the government too often act in their sectarian\r\ninterest. Iraq's Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish leaders frequently fail to\r\ndemonstrate the political will to act in Iraq's national interest, and\r\ntoo many Iraqi ministries lack the capacity to govern effectively. The\r\nresult is an even weaker central government than the constitution\r\nprovides.\r\n\r\nThere is widespread Iraqi, American, and international agreement on\r\nthe key issues confronting the Iraqi government: national\r\nreconciliation, including the negotiation of a \"political deal\" among\r\nIraq's sectarian groups on Constitution review, de-Baathification, oil\r\nrevenue sharing, provincial elections, the future of Kirkuk, and\r\namnesty; security, particularly curbing militias and reducing the\r\nviolence in Baghdad; and governance, including the provision of basic\r\nservices and the rollback of pervasive corruption. Because Iraqi\r\nleaders view issues through a sectarian prism, we will summarize the\r\ndiffering perspectives of Iraq's main sectarian groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSectarian Viewpoints\r\n\r\nThe Shia, the majority of Iraq's population, have gained power for the\r\nfirst time in more than 1,300 years. Above all, many Shia are\r\ninterested in preserving that power. However, fissures have emerged\r\nwithin the broad Shia coalition, known as the United Iraqi Alliance.\r\nShia factions are struggling for power--over regions, ministries, and\r\nIraq as a whole. The difficulties in holding together a broad and\r\nfractious coalition have led several observers in Baghdad to comment\r\nthat Shia leaders are held \"hostage to extremes.\" Within the coalition\r\nas a whole, there is a reluctance to reach a political accommodation\r\nwith the Sunnis or to disarm Shiite militias.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has demonstrated an understanding of\r\nthe key issues facing Iraq, notably the need for national\r\nreconciliation and security in Baghdad. Yet strains have emerged\r\nbetween Maliki's government and the United States. Maliki has publicly\r\nrejected a U.S. timetable to achieve certain benchmarks, ordered the\r\nremoval of blockades around Sadr City, sought more control over Iraqi\r\nsecurity forces, and resisted U.S. requests to move forward on\r\nreconciliation or on disbanding Shiite militias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSistani, Sadr, Hakim\r\n\r\nThe U.S. deals primarily with the Iraqi government, but the most\r\npowerful Shia figures in Iraq do not hold national office. Of the\r\nfollowing three vital power brokers in the Shia community, the United\r\nStates is unable to talk directly with one (Grand Ayatollah Ali\r\nal-Sistani) and does not talk to another (Moqtada al-Sadr).\r\n\r\nGRAND AYATOLLAH ALI AL-SISTANI: Sistani is the leading Shiite cleric\r\nin Iraq. Despite staying out of day-to-day politics, he has been the\r\nmost influential leader in the country: all major Shia leaders have\r\nsought his approval or guidance. Sistani has encouraged a unified Shia\r\nbloc with moderated aims within a unified Iraq. Sistani's influence\r\nmay be waning, as his words have not succeeded in preventing\r\nintra-Shia violence or retaliation against Sunnis.\r\n\r\nABDUL AZIZ AL-HAKIM: Hakim is a cleric and the leader of the Supreme\r\nCouncil for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), the largest and\r\nmost organized Shia political party. It seeks the creation of an\r\nautonomous Shia region comprising nine provinces in the south. Hakim\r\nhas consistently protected and advanced his party's position. SCIRI\r\nhas close ties with Iran.\r\n\r\nMOQTADA AL-SADR: Sadr has a large following among impoverished Shia,\r\nparticularly in Baghdad. He has joined Maliki's governing coalition,\r\nbut his Mahdi Army has clashed with the Badr Brigades, as well as with\r\nIraqi, U.S., and U.K. forces. Sadr claims to be an Iraqi nationalist.\r\nSeveral observers remarked to us that Sadr was following the model of\r\nHezbollah in Lebanon: building a political party that controls basic\r\nservices within the government and an armed militia outside of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunni Arabs feel displaced because of the loss of their traditional\r\nposition of power in Iraq. They are torn, unsure whether to seek their\r\naims through political participation or through violent insurgency.\r\nThey remain angry about U.S. decisions to dissolve Iraqi security\r\nforces and to pursue the \"de-Baathification\" of Iraq's government and\r\nsociety. Sunnis are confronted by paradoxes: they have opposed the\r\npresence of U.S. forces in Iraq but need those forces to protect them\r\nagainst Shia militias; they chafe at being governed by a majority Shia\r\nadministration but reject a federal, decentralized Iraq and do not see\r\na Sunni autonomous region as feasible for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHashimi and Dhari\r\n\r\nThe influence of Sunni Arab politicians in the government is\r\nquestionable. The leadership of the Sunni Arab insurgency is murky,\r\nbut the following two key Sunni Arab figures have broad support.\r\n\r\ntariq al-hashimi: Hashimi is one of two vice presidents of Iraq and\r\nthe head of the Iraqi Islamic Party, the largest Sunni Muslim bloc in\r\nparliament. Hashimi opposes the formation of autonomous regions and\r\nhas advocated the distribution of oil revenues based on population, a\r\nreversal of de-Baathification, and the removal of Shiite militia\r\nfighters from the Iraqi security forces. Shiite death squads have\r\nrecently killed three of his siblings.\r\n\r\nsheik harith al-dhari: Dhari is the head of the Muslim Scholars\r\nAssociation, the most influential Sunni organization in Iraq. Dhari\r\nhas condemned the American occupation and spoken out against the Iraqi\r\ngovernment. His organization has ties both to the Sunni Arab\r\ninsurgency and to Sunnis within the Iraqi government. A warrant was\r\nrecently issued for his arrest for inciting violence and terrorism, an\r\nact that sparked bitter Sunni protests across Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\nIraqi Kurds have succeeded in presenting a united front of two main\r\npolitical blocs--the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the\r\nPatriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The Kurds have secured a largely\r\nautonomous Kurdish region in the north, and have achieved a prominent\r\nrole for Kurds within the national government. Barzani leads the\r\nKurdish regional government, and Talabani is president of Iraq.\r\n\r\nLeading Kurdish politicians told us they preferred to be within a\r\ndemocratic, federal Iraqi state because an independent Kurdistan would\r\nbe surrounded by hostile neighbors. However, a majority of Kurds favor\r\nindependence. The Kurds have their own security forces--the\r\npeshmerga--which number roughly 100,000. They believe they could\r\naccommodate themselves to either a unified or a fractured Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarzani and Talabani\r\n\r\nKurdish politics has been dominated for years by two figures who have\r\nlong-standing ties in movements for Kurdish independence and\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nMASSOUD BARZANI: Barzani is the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic\r\nParty and the President of the Kurdish regional government. Barzani\r\nhas cooperated with his longtime rival, Jalal Talabani, in securing an\r\nempowered, autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Barzani has\r\nordered the lowering of Iraqi flags and raising of Kurdish flags in\r\nKurdish-controlled areas.\r\n\r\nJALAL TALABANI: Talabani is the leader of the Patriotic Union of\r\nKurdistan and the President of Iraq. Whereas Barzani has focused his\r\nefforts in Kurdistan, Talabani has secured power in Baghdad, and\r\nseveral important PUK government ministers are loyal to him. Talabani\r\nstrongly supports autonomy for Kurdistan. He has also sought to bring\r\nreal power to the office of the presidency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Issues\r\n\r\nNATIONAL RECONCILIATION. Prime Minister Maliki outlined a commendable\r\nprogram of national reconciliation soon after he entered office.\r\nHowever, the Iraqi government has not taken action on the key elements\r\nof national reconciliation: revising de-Baathification, which prevents\r\nmany Sunni Arabs from participating in governance and society;\r\nproviding amnesty for those who have fought against the government;\r\nsharing the country's oil revenues; demobilizing militias; amending\r\nthe constitution; and settling the future of Kirkuk.\r\n\r\nOne core issue is federalism. The Iraqi Constitution, which created a\r\nlargely autonomous Kurdistan region, allows other such regions to be\r\nestablished later, perhaps including a \"Shi'astan\" comprising nine\r\nsouthern provinces. This highly decentralized structure is favored by\r\nthe Kurds and many Shia (particularly supporters of Abdul Aziz\r\nal-Hakim), but it is anathema to Sunnis. First, Sunni Arabs are generally\r\nIraqi nationalists, albeit within the context of an Iraq they believe\r\nthey should govern. Second, because Iraq's energy resources are in the\r\nKurdish and Shia regions, there is no economically feasible \"Sunni\r\nregion.\" Particularly contentious is a provision in the constitution\r\nthat shares revenues nationally from current oil reserves, while\r\nallowing revenues from reserves discovered in the future to go to the\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe Sunnis did not actively participate in the constitution-drafting\r\nprocess, and acceded to entering the government only on the condition\r\nthat the constitution be amended. In September, the parliament agreed\r\nto initiate a constitutional review commission slated to complete its\r\nwork within one year; it delayed considering the question of forming a\r\nfederalized region in southern Iraq for eighteen months.\r\n\r\nAnother key unresolved issue is the future of Kirkuk, an oil-rich city\r\nin northern Iraq that is home to substantial numbers of Kurds, Arabs,\r\nand Turkmen. The Kurds insisted that the constitution require a\r\npopular referendum by December 2007 to determine whether Kirkuk can\r\nformally join the Kurdish administered region, an outcome that Arabs\r\nand Turkmen in Kirkuk staunchly oppose. The risks of further violence\r\nsparked by a Kirkuk referendum are great.\r\n\r\nIraq's leaders often claim that they do not want a division of the\r\ncountry, but we found that key Shia and Kurdish leaders have little\r\ncommitment to national reconciliation. One prominent Shia leader told\r\nus pointedly that the current government has the support of 80 percent\r\nof the population, notably excluding Sunni Arabs. Kurds have fought\r\nfor independence for decades, and when our Study Group visited Iraq,\r\nthe leader of the Kurdish region ordered the lowering of Iraqi flags\r\nand the raising of Kurdish flags. One senior American general\r\ncommented that the Iraqis \"still do not know what kind of country they\r\nwant to have.\" Yet many of Iraq's most powerful and well-positioned\r\nleaders are not working toward a united Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITY. The security situation cannot improve unless leaders act in\r\nsupport of national reconciliation. Shiite leaders must make the\r\ndecision to demobilize militias. Sunni Arabs must make the decision to\r\nseek their aims through a peaceful political process, not through\r\nviolent revolt. The Iraqi government and Sunni Arab tribes must\r\naggressively pursue al Qaeda.\r\n\r\nMilitias are currently seen as legitimate vehicles of political\r\naction. Shia political leaders make distinctions between the Sunni\r\ninsurgency (which seeks to overthrow the government) and Shia militias\r\n(which are used to fight Sunnis, secure neighborhoods, and maximize\r\npower within the government). Though Prime Minister Maliki has said he\r\nwill address the problem of militias, he has taken little meaningful\r\naction to curb their influence. He owes his office in large part to\r\nSadr and has shown little willingness to take on him or his Mahdi\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nSunni Arabs have not made the strategic decision to abandon violent\r\ninsurgency in favor of the political process. Sunni politicians within\r\nthe government have a limited level of support and influence among\r\ntheir own population, and questionable influence over the insurgency.\r\nInsurgents wage a campaign of intimidation against Sunni\r\nleaders--assassinating the family members of those who do participate in\r\nthe government. Too often, insurgents tolerate and cooperate with al\r\nQaeda, as they share a mutual interest in attacking U.S. and Shia\r\nforces. However, Sunni Arab tribal leaders in Anbar province recently\r\ntook the positive step of agreeing to pursue al Qaeda and foreign\r\nfighters in their midst, and have started to take action on those\r\ncommitments.\r\n\r\nSunni politicians told us that the U.S. military has to take on the\r\nmilitias; Shia politicians told us that the U.S. military has to help\r\nthem take out the Sunni insurgents and al Qaeda. Each side watches the\r\nother. Sunni insurgents will not lay down arms unless the Shia\r\nmilitias are disarmed. Shia militias will not disarm until the Sunni\r\ninsurgency is destroyed. To put it simply: there are many armed groups\r\nwithin Iraq, and very little will to lay down arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNANCE. The Iraqi government is not effectively providing its\r\npeople with basic services: electricity, drinking water, sewage,\r\nhealth care, and education. In many sectors, production is below or\r\nhovers around prewar levels. In Baghdad and other unstable areas, the\r\nsituation is much worse. There are five major reasons for this\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nFirst, the government sometimes provides services on a sectarian\r\nbasis. For example, in one Sunni neighborhood of Shia-governed\r\nBaghdad, there is less than two hours of electricity each day and\r\ntrash piles are waist-high. One American official told us that Baghdad\r\nis run like a \"Shia dictatorship\" because Sunnis boycotted provincial\r\nelections in 2005, and therefore are not represented in local\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSecond, security is lacking. Insurgents target key infrastructure. For\r\ninstance, electricity transmission towers are downed by explosives,\r\nand then sniper attacks prevent repairs from being made.\r\n\r\nThird, corruption is rampant. One senior Iraqi official estimated that\r\nofficial corruption costs Iraq $5-7 billion per year. Notable steps\r\nhave been taken: Iraq has a functioning audit board and inspectors\r\ngeneral in the ministries, and senior leaders including the Prime\r\nMinister have identified rooting out corruption as a national\r\npriority. But too many political leaders still pursue their personal,\r\nsectarian, or party interests. There are still no examples of senior\r\nofficials who have been brought before a court of law and convicted on\r\ncorruption charges.\r\n\r\nFourth, capacity is inadequate. Most of Iraq's technocratic class was\r\npushed out of the government as part of de-Baathification. Other\r\nskilled Iraqis have fled the country as violence has risen. Too often,\r\nIraq's elected representatives treat the ministries as political\r\nspoils. Many ministries can do little more than pay salaries, spending\r\nas little as 10-15 percent of their capital budget. They lack\r\ntechnical expertise and suffer from corruption, inefficiency, a\r\nbanking system that does not permit the transfer of moneys, extensive\r\nred tape put in place in part to deter corruption, and a Ministry of\r\nFinance reluctant to disburse funds.\r\n\r\nFifth, the judiciary is weak. Much has been done to establish an Iraqi\r\njudiciary, including a supreme court, and Iraq has some dedicated\r\njudges. But criminal investigations are conducted by magistrates, and\r\nthey are too few and inadequately trained to perform this function.\r\nIntimidation of the Iraqi judiciary has been ruthless. As one senior\r\nU.S. official said to us, \"We can protect judges, but not their\r\nfamilies, their extended families, their friends.\" Many Iraqis feel\r\nthat crime not only is unpunished, it is rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Economics\r\n\r\nThere has been some economic progress in Iraq, and Iraq has tremendous\r\npotential for growth. But economic development is hobbled by\r\ninsecurity, corruption, lack of investment, dilapidated\r\ninfrastructure, and uncertainty. As one U.S. official observed to us,\r\nIraq's economy has been badly shocked and is dysfunctional after\r\nsuffering decades of problems: Iraq had a police state economy in the\r\n1970s, a war economy in the 1980s, and a sanctions economy in the\r\n1990s. Immediate and long-term growth depends predominantly on the oil\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic Performance\r\n\r\nThere are some encouraging signs. Currency reserves are stable and\r\ngrowing at $12 billion. Consumer imports of computers, cell phones,\r\nand other appliances have increased dramatically. New businesses are\r\nopening, and construction is moving forward in secure areas. Because\r\nof Iraq's ample oil reserves, water resources, and fertile lands,\r\nsignificant growth is possible if violence is reduced and the capacity\r\nof government improves. For example, wheat yields increased more than\r\n40 percent in Kurdistan during this past year.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi government has also made progress in meeting benchmarks set\r\nby the International Monetary Fund. Most prominently, subsidies have\r\nbeen reduced--for instance, the price per liter of gas has increased\r\nfrom roughly 1.7 cents to 23 cents (a figure far closer to regional\r\nprices). However, energy and food subsidies generally remain a burden,\r\ncosting Iraq $11 billion per year.\r\n\r\nDespite the positive signs, many leading economic indicators are\r\nnegative. Instead of meeting a target of 10 percent, growth in Iraq is\r\nat roughly 4 percent this year. Inflation is above 50 percent.\r\nUnemployment estimates range widely from 20 to 60 percent. The\r\ninvestment climate is bleak, with foreign direct investment under 1\r\npercent of GDP. Too many Iraqis do not see tangible improvements in\r\ntheir daily economic situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOil Sector\r\n\r\nOil production and sales account for nearly 70 percent of Iraq's GDP,\r\nand more than 95 percent of government revenues. Iraq produces around\r\n2.2 million barrels per day, and exports about 1.5 million barrels per\r\nday. This is below both prewar production levels and the Iraqi\r\ngovernment's target of 2.5 million barrels per day, and far short of\r\nthe vast potential of the Iraqi oil sector. Fortunately for the\r\ngovernment, global energy prices have been higher than projected,\r\nmaking it possible for Iraq to meet its budget revenue targets.\r\n\r\nProblems with oil production are caused by lack of security, lack of\r\ninvestment, and lack of technical capacity. Insurgents with a detailed\r\nknowledge of Iraq's infrastructure target pipelines and oil\r\nfacilities. There is no metering system for the oil. There is poor\r\nmaintenance at pumping stations, pipelines, and port facilities, as\r\nwell as inadequate investment in modern technology. Iraq had a cadre\r\nof experts in the oil sector, but intimidation and an extended\r\nmigration of experts to other countries have eroded technical\r\ncapacity. Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest, and Iraq's\r\nMinistry of Oil has been unable to spend more than 15 percent of its\r\ncapital budget.\r\n\r\nCorruption is also debilitating. Experts estimate that 150,000 to\r\n200,000--and perhaps as many as 500,000--barrels of oil per day are\r\nbeing stolen. Controlled prices for refined products result in\r\nshortages within Iraq, which drive consumers to the thriving black\r\nmarket. One senior U.S. official told us that corruption is more\r\nresponsible than insurgents for breakdowns in the oil sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Politics of Oil\r\n\r\nThe politics of oil has the potential to further damage the country's\r\nalready fragile efforts to create a unified central government. The\r\nIraqi Constitution leaves the door open for regions to take the lead\r\nin developing new oil resources. Article 108 states that \"oil and gas\r\nare the ownership of all the peoples of Iraq in all the regions and\r\ngovernorates,\" while Article 109 tasks the federal government with\r\n\"the management of oil and gas extracted from current fields.\" This\r\nlanguage has led to contention over what constitutes a \"new\" or an\r\n\"existing\" resource, a question that has profound ramifications for\r\nthe ultimate control of future oil revenue.\r\n\r\nSenior members of Iraq's oil industry argue that a national oil\r\ncompany could reduce political tensions by centralizing revenues and\r\nreducing regional or local claims to a percentage of the revenue\r\nderived from production. However, regional leaders are suspicious and\r\nresist this proposal, affirming the rights of local communities to\r\nhave direct access to the inflow of oil revenue. Kurdish leaders have\r\nbeen particularly aggressive in asserting independent control of their\r\noil assets, signing and implementing investment deals with foreign oil\r\ncompanies in northern Iraq. Shia politicians are also reported to be\r\nnegotiating oil investment contracts with foreign companies.\r\n\r\nThere are proposals to redistribute a portion of oil revenues directly\r\nto the population on a per capita basis. These proposals have the\r\npotential to give all Iraqi citizens a stake in the nation's chief\r\nnatural resource, but it would take time to develop a fair\r\ndistribution system. Oil revenues have been incorporated into state\r\nbudget projections for the next several years. There is no institution\r\nin Iraq at present that could properly implement such a distribution\r\nsystem. It would take substantial time to establish, and would have to\r\nbe based on a well-developed state census and income tax system, which\r\nIraq currently lacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S.-Led Reconstruction Efforts\r\n\r\nThe United States has appropriated a total of about $34 billion to\r\nsupport the reconstruction of Iraq, of which about $21 billion has\r\nbeen appropriated for the \"Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\"\r\nNearly $16 billion has been spent, and almost all the funds have been\r\ncommitted. The administration requested $1.6 billion for\r\nreconstruction in FY 2006, and received $1.485 billion. The\r\nadministration requested $750 million for FY 2007. The trend line for\r\neconomic assistance in FY 2008 also appears downward.\r\n\r\nCongress has little appetite for appropriating more funds for\r\nreconstruction. There is a substantial need for continued\r\nreconstruction in Iraq, but serious questions remain about the\r\ncapacity of the U.S. and Iraqi governments.\r\n\r\nThe coordination of assistance programs by the Defense Department,\r\nState Department, United States Agency for International Development,\r\nand other agencies has been ineffective. There are no clear lines\r\nestablishing who is in charge of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nAs resources decline, the U.S. reconstruction effort is changing its\r\nfocus, shifting from infrastructure, education, and health to\r\nsmaller-scale ventures that are chosen and to some degree managed by\r\nlocal communities. A major attempt is also being made to improve the\r\ncapacity of government bureaucracies at the national, regional, and\r\nprovincial levels to provide services to the population as well as to\r\nselect and manage infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\nThe United States has people embedded in several Iraqi ministries, but\r\nit confronts problems with access and sustainability. Moqtada al-Sadr\r\nobjects to the U.S. presence in Iraq, and therefore the ministries he\r\ncontrols--Health, Agriculture, and Transportation--will not work with\r\nAmericans. It is not clear that Iraqis can or will maintain and\r\noperate reconstruction projects launched by the United States.\r\n\r\nSeveral senior military officers commented to us that the Commander's\r\nEmergency Response Program, which funds quick-impact projects such as\r\nthe clearing of sewage and the restoration of basic services, is\r\nvital. The U.S. Agency for International Development, in contrast, is\r\nfocused on long-term economic development and capacity building, but\r\nfunds have not been committed to support these efforts into the\r\nfuture. The State Department leads seven Provincial Reconstruction\r\nTeams operating around the country. These teams can have a positive\r\neffect in secure areas, but not in areas where their work is hampered\r\nby significant security constraints.\r\n\r\nSubstantial reconstruction funds have also been provided to\r\ncontractors, and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction\r\nhas documented numerous instances of waste and abuse. They have not\r\nall been put right. Contracting has gradually improved, as more\r\noversight has been exercised and fewer cost-plus contracts have been\r\ngranted; in addition, the use of Iraqi contractors has enabled the\r\nemployment of more Iraqis in reconstruction projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. International Support\r\n\r\nInternational support for Iraqi reconstruction has been tepid.\r\nInternational donors pledged $13.5 billion to support reconstruction,\r\nbut less than $4 billion has been delivered.\r\n\r\nAn important agreement with the Paris Club relieved a significant\r\namount of Iraq's government debt and put the country on firmer\r\nfinancial footing. But the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia and\r\nKuwait, hold large amounts of Iraqi debt that they have not forgiven.\r\n\r\nThe United States is currently working with the United Nations and\r\nother partners to fashion the \"International Compact\" on Iraq. The\r\ngoal is to provide Iraqis with greater debt relief and credits from\r\nthe Gulf States, as well as to deliver on pledged aid from\r\ninternational donors. In return, the Iraqi government will agree to\r\nachieve certain economic reform milestones, such as building\r\nanticorruption measures into Iraqi institutions, adopting a fair legal\r\nframework for foreign investors, and reaching economic\r\nself-sufficiency by 2012. Several U.S. and international officials told\r\nus that the compact could be an opportunity to seek greater international\r\nengagement in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Region\r\n\r\nThe policies and actions of Iraq's neighbors greatly influence its\r\nstability and prosperity. No country in the region wants a chaotic\r\nIraq. Yet Iraq's neighbors are doing little to help it, and some are\r\nundercutting its stability. Iraqis complain that neighbors are\r\nmeddling in their affairs. When asked which of Iraq's neighbors are\r\nintervening in Iraq, one senior Iraqi official replied, \"All of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation in Iraq is linked with events in the region. U.S.\r\nefforts in Afghanistan have been complicated by the overriding focus\r\nof U.S. attention and resources on Iraq. Several Iraqi, U.S., and\r\ninternational officials commented to us that Iraqi opposition to the\r\nUnited States--and support for Sadr--spiked in the aftermath of\r\nIsrael's bombing campaign in Lebanon. The actions of Syria and Iran in\r\nIraq are often tied to their broader concerns with the United States.\r\nMany Sunni Arab states are concerned about rising Iranian influence in\r\nIraq and the region. Most of the region's countries are wary of U.S.\r\nefforts to promote democracy in Iraq and the Middle East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeighboring States\r\n\r\nIRAN. Of all the neighbors, Iran has the most leverage in Iraq. Iran\r\nhas long-standing ties to many Iraqi Shia politicians, many of whom\r\nwere exiled to Iran during the Saddam Hussein regime. Iran has\r\nprovided arms, financial support, and training for Shiite militias\r\nwithin Iraq, as well as political support for Shia parties. There are\r\nalso reports that Iran has supplied improvised explosive devices to\r\ngroups--including Sunni Arab insurgents--that attack U.S. forces. The\r\nIranian border with Iraq is porous, and millions of Iranians travel to\r\nIraq each year to visit Shia holy sites. Many Iraqis spoke of Iranian\r\nmeddling, and Sunnis took a particularly alarmist view. One leading\r\nSunni politician told us, \"If you turn over any stone in Iraq today,\r\nyou will find Iran underneath.\"\r\n\r\nU.S., Iraqi, and international officials also commented on the range\r\nof tensions between the United States and Iran, including Iran's\r\nnuclear program, Iran's support for terrorism, Iran's influence in\r\nLebanon and the region, and Iran's influence in Iraq. Iran appears\r\ncontent for the U.S. military to be tied down in Iraq, a position that\r\nlimits U.S. options in addressing Iran's nuclear program and allows\r\nIran leverage over stability in Iraq. Proposed talks between Iran and\r\nthe United States about the situation in Iraq have not taken place.\r\nOne Iraqi official told us: \"Iran is negotiating with the United\r\nStates in the streets of Baghdad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRIA. Syria is also playing a counterproductive role. Iraqis are\r\nupset about what they perceive as Syrian support for efforts to\r\nundermine the Iraqi government. The Syrian role is not so much to take\r\nactive measures as to countenance malign neglect: the Syrians look the\r\nother way as arms and foreign fighters flow across their border into\r\nIraq, and former Baathist leaders find a safe haven within Syria. Like\r\nIran, Syria is content to see the United States tied down in Iraq.\r\nThat said, the Syrians have indicated that they want a dialogue with\r\nthe United States, and in November 2006 agreed to restore diplomatic\r\nrelations with Iraq after a 24-year break.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF STATES. These countries for the most part\r\nhave been passive and disengaged. They have declined to provide debt\r\nrelief or substantial economic assistance to the Iraqi government.\r\nSeveral Iraqi Sunni Arab politicians complained that Saudi Arabia has\r\nnot provided political support for their fellow Sunnis within Iraq.\r\nOne observed that Saudi Arabia did not even send a letter when the\r\nIraqi government was formed, whereas Iran has an ambassador in Iraq.\r\nFunding for the Sunni insurgency comes from private individuals within\r\nSaudi Arabia and the Gulf States, even as those governments help\r\nfacilitate U.S. military operations in Iraq by providing basing and\r\noverflight rights and by cooperating on intelligence issues.\r\n\r\nAs worries about Iraq increase, the Gulf States are becoming more\r\nactive. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have hosted meetings in\r\nsupport of the International Compact. Saudi Arabia recently took the\r\npositive step of hosting a conference of Iraqi religious leaders in\r\nMecca. Several Gulf States have helped foster dialogue with Iraq's\r\nSunni Arab population. While the Gulf States are not proponents of\r\ndemocracy in Iraq, they worry about the direction of events:\r\nbattle-hardened insurgents from Iraq could pose a threat to their own\r\ninternal stability, and the growth of Iranian influence in the region\r\nis deeply troubling to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY. Turkish policy toward Iraq is focused on discouraging Kurdish\r\nnationalism, which is seen as an existential threat to Turkey's own\r\ninternal stability. The Turks have supported the Turkmen minority\r\nwithin Iraq and have used their influence to try to block the\r\nincorporation of Kirkuk into Iraqi Kurdistan. At the same time,\r\nTurkish companies have invested in Kurdish areas in northern Iraq, and\r\nTurkish and Kurdish leaders have sought constructive engagement on\r\npolitical, security, and economic issues.\r\n\r\nThe Turks are deeply concerned about the operations of the Kurdish\r\nWorkers Party (PKK)--a terrorist group based in northern Iraq that has\r\nkilled thousands of Turks. They are upset that the United States and\r\nIraq have not targeted the PKK more aggressively. The Turks have\r\nthreatened to go after the PKK themselves, and have made several\r\nforays across the border into Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN AND EGYPT. Both Jordan and Egypt have provided some assistance\r\nfor the Iraqi government. Jordan has trained thousands of Iraqi\r\npolice, has an ambassador in Baghdad, and King Abdullah recently\r\nhosted a meeting in Amman between President Bush and Prime Minister\r\nMaliki. Egypt has provided some limited Iraqi army training. Both\r\nJordan and Egypt have facilitated U.S. military operations--Jordan by\r\nallowing overflight and search-and-rescue operations, Egypt by\r\nallowing overflight and Suez Canal transits; both provide important\r\ncooperation on intelligence. Jordan is currently home to 700,000 Iraqi\r\nrefugees (equal to 10 percent of its population) and fears a flood of\r\nmany more. Both Jordan and Egypt are concerned about the position of\r\nIraq's Sunni Arabs and want constitutional reforms in Iraq to bolster\r\nthe Sunni community. They also fear the return of insurgents to their\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Community\r\n\r\nThe international community beyond the United Kingdom and our other\r\ncoalition partners has played a limited role in Iraq. The United\r\nNations--acting under Security Council Resolution 1546--has a small\r\npresence in Iraq; it has assisted in holding elections, drafting the\r\nconstitution, organizing the government, and building institutions.\r\nThe World Bank, which has committed a limited number of resources, has\r\none and sometimes two staff in Iraq. The European Union has a\r\nrepresentative there.\r\n\r\nSeveral U.S.-based and international nongovernmental organizations\r\nhave done excellent work within Iraq, operating under great hardship.\r\nBoth Iraqi and international nongovernmental organizations play an\r\nimportant role in reaching across sectarian lines to enhance dialogue\r\nand understanding, and several U.S.-based organizations have employed\r\nsubstantial resources to help Iraqis develop their democracy. However,\r\nthe participation of international nongovernmental organizations is\r\nconstrained by the lack of security, and their Iraqi counterparts face\r\na cumbersome and often politicized process of registration with the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom has dedicated an extraordinary amount of resources\r\nto Iraq and has made great sacrifices. In addition to 7,200 troops,\r\nthe United Kingdom has a substantial diplomatic presence, particularly\r\nin Basra and the Iraqi southeast. The United Kingdom has been an\r\nactive and key player at every stage of Iraq's political development.\r\nU.K. officials told us that they remain committed to working for\r\nstability in Iraq, and will reduce their commitment of troops and\r\nresources in response to the situation on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Conclusions\r\n\r\nThe United States has made a massive commitment to the future of Iraq\r\nin both blood and treasure. As of December 2006, nearly 2,900\r\nAmericans have lost their lives serving in Iraq. Another 21,000\r\nAmericans have been wounded, many severely.\r\n\r\nTo date, the United States has spent roughly $400 billion on the Iraq\r\nWar, and costs are running about $8 billion per month. In addition,\r\nthe United States must expect significant \"tail costs\" to come. Caring\r\nfor veterans and replacing lost equipment will run into the hundreds\r\nof billions of dollars. Estimates run as high as $2 trillion for the\r\nfinal cost of the U.S. involvement in Iraq.\r\n\r\nDespite a massive effort, stability in Iraq remains elusive and the\r\nsituation is deteriorating. The Iraqi government cannot now govern,\r\nsustain, and defend itself without the support of the United States.\r\nIraqis have not been convinced that they must take responsibility for\r\ntheir own future. Iraq's neighbors and much of the international\r\ncommunity have not been persuaded to play an active and constructive\r\nrole in supporting Iraq. The ability of the United States to shape\r\noutcomes is diminishing. Time is running out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Consequences of Continued Decline in Iraq\r\n\r\nIf the situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate, the consequences\r\ncould be severe for Iraq, the United States, the region, and the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nContinuing violence could lead toward greater chaos, and inflict\r\ngreater suffering upon the Iraqi people. A collapse of Iraq's\r\ngovernment and economy would further cripple a country already unable\r\nto meet its people's needs. Iraq's security forces could split along\r\nsectarian lines. A humanitarian catastrophe could follow as more\r\nrefugees are forced to relocate across the country and the region.\r\nEthnic cleansing could escalate. The Iraqi people could be subjected\r\nto another strongman who flexes the political and military muscle\r\nrequired to impose order amid anarchy. Freedoms could be lost.\r\n\r\nOther countries in the region fear significant violence crossing their\r\nborders. Chaos in Iraq could lead those countries to intervene to\r\nprotect their own interests, thereby perhaps sparking a broader\r\nregional war. Turkey could send troops into northern Iraq to prevent\r\nKurdistan from declaring independence. Iran could send in troops to\r\nrestore stability in southern Iraq and perhaps gain control of oil\r\nfields. The regional influence of Iran could rise at a time when that\r\ncountry is on a path to producing nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors from neighboring countries told us that they fear the\r\ndistinct possibility of Sunni-Shia clashes across the Islamic world.\r\nMany expressed a fear of Shia insurrections--perhaps fomented by\r\nIran--in Sunni-ruled states. Such a broader sectarian conflict could\r\nopen a Pandora's box of problems--including the radicalization of\r\npopulations, mass movements of populations, and regime changes--that\r\nmight take decades to play out. If the instability in Iraq spreads to\r\nthe other Gulf States, a drop in oil production and exports could lead\r\nto a sharp increase in the price of oil and thus could harm the global\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nTerrorism could grow. As one Iraqi official told us, \"Al Qaeda is now\r\na franchise in Iraq, like McDonald's.\" Left unchecked, al Qaeda in\r\nIraq could continue to incite violence between Sunnis and Shia. A\r\nchaotic Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for\r\nterrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally. Al Qaeda will\r\nportray any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant\r\nvictory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for their\r\ncause in the region and around the world. Ayman al-Zawahiri, deputy to\r\nOsama bin Laden, has declared Iraq a focus for al Qaeda: they will\r\nseek to expel the Americans and then spread \"the jihad wave to the\r\nsecular countries neighboring Iraq.\" A senior European official told\r\nus that failure in Iraq could incite terrorist attacks within his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe global standing of the United States could suffer if Iraq descends\r\nfurther into chaos. Iraq is a major test of, and strain on, U.S.\r\nmilitary, diplomatic, and financial capacities. Perceived failure\r\nthere could diminish America's credibility and influence in a region\r\nthat is the center of the Islamic world and vital to the world's\r\nenergy supply. This loss would reduce America's global influence at a\r\ntime when pressing issues in North Korea, Iran, and elsewhere demand\r\nour full attention and strong U.S. leadership of international\r\nalliances. And the longer that U.S. political and military resources\r\nare tied down in Iraq, the more the chances for American failure in\r\nAfghanistan increase.\r\n\r\nContinued problems in Iraq could lead to greater polarization within\r\nthe United States. Sixty-six percent of Americans disapprove of the\r\ngovernment's handling of the war, and more than 60 percent feel that\r\nthere is no clear plan for moving forward. The November elections were\r\nlargely viewed as a referendum on the progress in Iraq. Arguments\r\nabout continuing to provide security and assistance to Iraq will fall\r\non deaf ears if Americans become disillusioned with the government\r\nthat the United States invested so much to create. U.S. foreign policy\r\ncannot be successfully sustained without the broad support of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nContinued problems in Iraq could also lead to greater Iraqi opposition\r\nto the United States. Recent polling indicates that only 36 percent of\r\nIraqis feel their country is heading in the right direction, and 79\r\npercent of Iraqis have a \"mostly negative\" view of the influence that\r\nthe United States has in their country. Sixty-one percent of Iraqis\r\napprove of attacks on U.S.-led forces. If Iraqis continue to perceive\r\nAmericans as representing an occupying force, the United States could\r\nbecome its own worst enemy in a land it liberated from tyranny.\r\n\r\nThese and other predictions of dire consequences in Iraq and the\r\nregion are by no means a certainty. Iraq has taken several positive\r\nsteps since Saddam Hussein was overthrown: Iraqis restored full\r\nsovereignty, conducted open national elections, drafted a permanent\r\nconstitution, ratified that constitution, and elected a new government\r\npursuant to that constitution. Iraqis may become so sobered by the\r\nprospect of an unfolding civil war and intervention by their regional\r\nneighbors that they take the steps necessary to avert catastrophe. But\r\nat the moment, such a scenario seems implausible because the Iraqi\r\npeople and their leaders have been slow to demonstrate the capacity or\r\nwill to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Some Alternative Courses in Iraq\r\n\r\nBecause of the gravity of the situation in Iraq and of its\r\nconsequences for Iraq, the United States, the region, and the world,\r\nthe Iraq Study Group has carefully considered the full range of\r\nalternative approaches for moving forward. We recognize that there is\r\nno perfect solution and that all that have been suggested have flaws.\r\nThe following are some of the more notable possibilities that we have\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Precipitate Withdrawal\r\n\r\nBecause of the importance of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and\r\nthe role and commitments of the United States in initiating events\r\nthat have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong\r\nfor the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate\r\nwithdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from\r\nIraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and\r\nfurther deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the\r\nadverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a\r\nsignificant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional\r\ndestabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would\r\ndepict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq\r\ndescends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually\r\nrequire the United States to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Staying the Course\r\n\r\nCurrent U.S. policy is not working, as the level of violence in Iraq\r\nis rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation.\r\nMaking no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at\r\na high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month. The United\r\nStates is spending $2 billion a week. Our ability to respond to other\r\ninternational crises is constrained. A majority of the American people\r\nare soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over\r\nan extended period, especially when progress is not being made. The\r\nlonger the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more\r\nresentment will grow among Iraqis who believe they are subjects of a\r\nrepressive American occupation. As one U.S. official said to us, \"Our\r\nleaving would make it worse. . . . The current approach without\r\nmodification will not make it better.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. More Troops for Iraq\r\n\r\nSustained increases in U.S. troop levels would not solve the\r\nfundamental cause of violence in Iraq, which is the absence of\r\nnational reconciliation. A senior American general told us that adding\r\nU.S. troops might temporarily help limit violence in a highly\r\nlocalized area. However, past experience indicates that the violence\r\nwould simply rekindle as soon as U.S. forces are moved to another\r\narea. As another American general told us, if the Iraqi government\r\ndoes not make political progress, \"all the troops in the world will\r\nnot provide security.\" Meanwhile, America's military capacity is\r\nstretched thin: we do not have the troops or equipment to make a\r\nsubstantial, sustained increase in our troop presence. Increased\r\ndeployments to Iraq would also necessarily hamper our ability to\r\nprovide adequate resources for our efforts in Afghanistan or respond\r\nto crises around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Devolution to Three Regions\r\n\r\nThe costs associated with devolving Iraq into three semiautonomous\r\nregions with loose central control would be too high. Because Iraq's\r\npopulation is not neatly separated, regional boundaries cannot be easily\r\ndrawn. All eighteen Iraqi provinces have mixed populations, as do\r\nBaghdad and most other major cities in Iraq. A rapid devolution could\r\nresult in mass population movements, collapse of the Iraqi security\r\nforces, strengthening of militias, ethnic cleansing, destabilization\r\nof neighboring states, or attempts by neighboring states to dominate\r\nIraqi regions. Iraqis, particularly Sunni Arabs, told us that such a\r\ndivision would confirm wider fears across the Arab world that the\r\nUnited States invaded Iraq to weaken a strong Arab state.\r\n\r\nWhile such devolution is a possible consequence of continued\r\ninstability in Iraq, we do not believe the United States should\r\nsupport this course as a policy goal or impose this outcome on the\r\nIraqi state. If events were to move irreversibly in this direction,\r\nthe United States should manage the situation to ameliorate\r\nhumanitarian consequences, contain the spread of violence, and\r\nminimize regional instability. The United States should support as\r\nmuch as possible central control by governmental authorities in\r\nBaghdad, particularly on the question of oil revenues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Achieving Our Goals\r\n\r\nWe agree with the goal of U.S. policy in Iraq, as stated by the\r\nPresident: an Iraq that can \"govern itself, sustain itself, and defend\r\nitself.\" In our view, this definition entails an Iraq with a broadly\r\nrepresentative government that maintains its territorial integrity, is\r\nat peace with its neighbors, denies terrorism a sanctuary, and doesn't\r\nbrutalize its own people. Given the current situation in Iraq,\r\nachieving this goal will require much time and will depend primarily\r\non the actions of the Iraqi people.\r\n\r\nIn our judgment, there is a new way forward for the United States to\r\nsupport this objective, and it will offer people of Iraq a reasonable\r\nopportunity to lead a better life than they did under Saddam Hussein.\r\nOur recommended course has shortcomings, as does each of the policy\r\nalternatives we have reviewed. We firmly believe, however, that it\r\nincludes the best strategies and tactics available to us to positively\r\ninfluence the outcome in Iraq and the region. We believe that it could\r\nenable a responsible transition that will give the Iraqi people a\r\nchance to pursue a better future, as well as serving America's\r\ninterests and values in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Way Forward--A New Approach\r\n\r\nProgress in Iraq is still possible if new approaches are taken\r\npromptly by Iraq, the United States, and other countries that have a\r\nstake in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nTo attain the goals we have outlined, changes in course must be made\r\nboth outside and inside Iraq. Our report offers a comprehensive\r\nstrategy to build regional and international support for stability in\r\nIraq, as it encourages the Iraqi people to assume control of their own\r\ndestiny. It offers a responsible transition.\r\n\r\nExternally, the United States should immediately begin to employ all\r\nelements of American power to construct a regional mechanism that can\r\nsupport, rather than retard, progress in Iraq. Internally, the Iraqi\r\ngovernment must take the steps required to achieve national\r\nreconciliation, reduce violence, and improve the daily lives of\r\nIraqis. Efforts to implement these external and internal strategies\r\nmust begin now and must be undertaken in concert with one another.\r\n\r\nThis responsible transition can allow for a reduction in the U.S.\r\npresence in Iraq over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The External Approach: Building an International Consensus\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States must build a new international consensus for\r\nstability in Iraq and the region.\r\n\r\nIn order to foster such consensus, the United States should embark on\r\na robust diplomatic effort to establish an international support\r\nstructure intended to stabilize Iraq and ease tensions in other\r\ncountries in the region. This support structure should include every\r\ncountry that has an interest in averting a chaotic Iraq, including all\r\nof Iraq's neighbors--Iran and Syria among them. Despite the well-known\r\ndifferences between many of these countries, they all share an\r\ninterest in avoiding the horrific consequences that would flow from a\r\nchaotic Iraq, particularly a humanitarian catastrophe and regional\r\ndestabilization.\r\n\r\nA reinvigorated diplomatic effort is required because it is clear that\r\nthe Iraqi government cannot succeed in governing, defending, and\r\nsustaining itself by relying on U.S. military and economic support\r\nalone. Nor can the Iraqi government succeed by relying only on U.S.\r\nmilitary support in conjunction with Iraqi military and police\r\ncapabilities. Some states have been withholding commitments they could\r\nmake to support Iraq's stabilization and reconstruction. Some states\r\nhave been actively undermining stability in Iraq. To achieve a\r\npolitical solution within Iraq, a broader international support\r\nstructure is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The New Diplomatic Offensive\r\n\r\nIraq cannot be addressed effectively in isolation from other major\r\nregional issues, interests, and unresolved conflicts. To put it\r\nsimply, all key issues in the Middle East--the Arab-Israeli conflict,\r\nIraq, Iran, the need for political and economic reforms, and extremism\r\nand terrorism--are inextricably linked. In addition to supporting\r\nstability in Iraq, a comprehensive diplomatic offensive--the New\r\nDiplomatic Offensive--should address these key regional issues. By\r\ndoing so, it would help marginalize extremists and terrorists, promote\r\nU.S. values and interests, and improve America's global image.\r\n\r\nUnder the diplomatic offensive, we propose regional and international\r\ninitiatives and steps to assist the Iraqi government in achieving\r\ncertain security, political, and economic milestones. Achieving these\r\nmilestones will require at least the acquiescence of Iraq's neighbors,\r\nand their active and timely cooperation would be highly desirable.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic offensive would extend beyond the primarily economic\r\n\"Compact for Iraq\" by also emphasizing political, diplomatic, and\r\nsecurity issues. At the same time, it would be coordinated with the\r\ngoals of the Compact for Iraq. The diplomatic offensive would also be\r\nbroader and more far-reaching than the \"Gulf Plus Two\" efforts\r\ncurrently being conducted, and those efforts should be folded into and\r\nbecome part of the diplomatic offensive.\r\n\r\nStates included within the diplomatic offensive can play a major role\r\nin reinforcing national reconciliation efforts between Iraqi Sunnis\r\nand Shia. Such reinforcement would contribute substantially to\r\nlegitimizing of the political process in Iraq. Iraq's leaders may not\r\nbe able to come together unless they receive the necessary signals and\r\nsupport from abroad. This backing will not materialize of its own\r\naccord, and must be encouraged urgently by the United States.\r\n\r\nIn order to advance a comprehensive diplomatic solution, the Study\r\nGroup recommends as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 1: The United States, working with the Iraqi\r\ngovernment, should launch the comprehensive New Diplomatic Offensive\r\nto deal with the problems of Iraq and of the region. This new\r\ndiplomatic offensive should be launched before December 31, 2006.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 2: The goals of the diplomatic offensive as it relates\r\nto regional players should be to:\r\n\r\ni. Support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\r\n\r\nii. Stop destabilizing interventions and actions by Iraq's neighbors.\r\n\r\niii. Secure Iraq's borders, including the use of joint patrols with\r\nneighboring countries.\r\n\r\niv. Prevent the expansion of the instability and conflict beyond\r\nIraq's borders.\r\n\r\nv. Promote economic assistance, commerce, trade, political support,\r\nand, if possible, military assistance for the Iraqi government from\r\nnon-neighboring Muslim nations.\r\n\r\nvi. Energize countries to support national political reconciliation in\r\nIraq.\r\n\r\nvii. Validate Iraq's legitimacy by resuming diplomatic relations,\r\nwhere appropriate, and reestablishing embassies in Baghdad.\r\n\r\nviii. Assist Iraq in establishing active working embassies in key\r\ncapitals in the region (for example, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\r\n\r\nix. Help Iraq reach a mutually acceptable agreement on Kirkuk.\r\n\r\nx. Assist the Iraqi government in achieving certain security,\r\npolitical, and economic milestones, including better performance on\r\nissues such as national reconciliation, equitable distribution of oil\r\nrevenues, and the dismantling of militias.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 3: As a complement to the diplomatic offensive, and in\r\naddition to the Support Group discussed below, the United States and\r\nthe Iraqi government should support the holding of a conference or\r\nmeeting in Baghdad of the Organization of the Islamic Conference or\r\nthe Arab League both to assist the Iraqi government in promoting\r\nnational reconciliation in Iraq and to reestablish their diplomatic\r\npresence in Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Iraq International Support Group\r\n\r\nThis new diplomatic offensive cannot be successful unless it includes\r\nthe active participation of those countries that have a critical stake\r\nin preventing Iraq from falling into chaos. To encourage their\r\nparticipation, the United States should immediately seek the creation\r\nof the Iraq International Support Group. The Support Group should also\r\ninclude all countries that border Iraq as well as other key countries\r\nin the region and the world.\r\n\r\nThe Support Group would not seek to impose obligations or undertakings\r\non the government of Iraq. Instead, the Support Group would assist\r\nIraq in ways the government of Iraq would desire, attempting to\r\nstrengthen Iraq's sovereignty--not diminish it.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to Iraq Study Group members that all of Iraq's neighbors\r\nare anxious about the situation in Iraq. They favor a unified Iraq\r\nthat is strong enough to maintain its territorial integrity, but not\r\nso powerful as to threaten its neighbors. None favors the breakup of\r\nthe Iraqi state. Each country in the region views the situation in\r\nIraq through the filter of its particular set of interests. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n\r\n--Turkey opposes an independent or even highly autonomous Kurdistan\r\nbecause of its own national security considerations.\r\n\r\n--Iran backs Shia claims and supports various Shia militias in Iraq,\r\nbut it also supports other groups in order to enhance its influence\r\nand hedge its bets on possible outcomes.\r\n\r\n--Syria, despite facilitating support for Iraqi insurgent groups,\r\nwould be threatened by the impact that the breakup of Iraq would have\r\non its own multiethnic and multiconfessional society.\r\n\r\n--Kuwait wants to ensure that it will not once again be the victim of\r\nIraqi irredentism and aggression.\r\n\r\n--Saudi Arabia and Jordan share Sunni concerns over Shia ascendancy in\r\nIraq and the region as a whole.\r\n\r\n--The other Arab Gulf states also recognize the benefits of an outcome\r\nin Iraq that does not destabilize the region and exacerbate Shia-Sunni\r\ntensions.\r\n\r\n--None of Iraq's neighbors--especially major countries such as Egypt,\r\nSaudi Arabia, and Israel--see it in their interest for the situation\r\nin Iraq to lead to aggrandized regional influence by Iran. Indeed,\r\nthey may take active steps to limit Iran's influence, steps that could\r\nlead to an intraregional conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft to their own devices, these governments will tend to reinforce\r\nethnic, sectarian, and political divisions within Iraqi society. But\r\nif the Support Group takes a systematic and active approach toward\r\nconsidering the concerns of each country, we believe that each can be\r\nencouraged to play a positive role in Iraq and the region.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUDI ARABIA. Saudi Arabia's agreement not to intervene with\r\nassistance to Sunni Arab Iraqis could be an essential quid pro quo for\r\nsimilar forbearance on the part of other neighbors, especially Iran.\r\nThe Saudis could use their Islamic credentials to help reconcile\r\ndifferences between Iraqi factions and build broader support in the\r\nIslamic world for a stabilization agreement, as their recent hosting\r\nof a meeting of Islamic religious leaders in Mecca suggests. If the\r\ngovernment in Baghdad pursues a path of national reconciliation with\r\nthe Sunnis, the Saudis could help Iraq confront and eliminate al Qaeda\r\nin Iraq. They could also cancel the Iraqi debt owed them. In addition,\r\nthe Saudis might be helpful in persuading the Syrians to cooperate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY. As a major Sunni Muslim country on Iraq's borders, Turkey can\r\nbe a partner in supporting the national reconciliation process in\r\nIraq. Such efforts can be particularly helpful given Turkey's interest\r\nin Kurdistan remaining an integral part of a unified Iraq and its\r\ninterest in preventing a safe haven for Kurdish terrorists (the PKK).\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT. Because of its important role in the Arab world, Egypt should\r\nbe encouraged to foster the national reconciliation process in Iraq\r\nwith a focus on getting the Sunnis to participate. At the same time,\r\nEgypt has the means, and indeed has offered, to train groups of Iraqi\r\nmilitary and security forces in Egypt on a rotational basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nJORDAN. Jordan, like Egypt, can help in the national reconciliation\r\nprocess in Iraq with the Sunnis. It too has the professional\r\ncapability to train and equip Iraqi military and security forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 4: As an instrument of the New Diplomatic Offensive, an\r\nIraq International Support Group should be organized immediately\r\nfollowing the launch of the New Diplomatic Offensive.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 5: The Support Group should consist of Iraq and all the\r\nstates bordering Iraq, including Iran and Syria; the key regional\r\nstates, including Egypt and the Gulf States; the five permanent\r\nmembers of the United Nations Security Council; the European Union;\r\nand, of course, Iraq itself. Other countries--for instance, Germany,\r\nJapan and South Korea--that might be willing to contribute to\r\nresolving political, diplomatic, and security problems affecting Iraq\r\ncould also become members.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 6: The New Diplomatic Offensive and the work of the\r\nSupport Group should be carried out with urgency, and should be\r\nconducted by and organized at the level of foreign minister or above.\r\nThe Secretary of State, if not the President, should lead the U.S.\r\neffort. That effort should be both bilateral and multilateral, as\r\ncircumstances require.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 7: The Support Group should call on the participation\r\nof the office of the United Nations Secretary-General in its work. The\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General should designate a Special Envoy as\r\nhis representative.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 8: The Support Group, as part of the New Diplomatic\r\nOffensive, should develop specific approaches to neighboring countries\r\nthat take into account the interests, perspectives, and potential\r\ncontributions as suggested above.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Dealing with Iran and Syria\r\n\r\nDealing with Iran and Syria is controversial. Nevertheless, it is our\r\nview that in diplomacy, a nation can and should engage its adversaries\r\nand enemies to try to resolve conflicts and differences consistent\r\nwith its own interests. Accordingly, the Support Group should actively\r\nengage Iran and Syria in its diplomatic dialogue, without\r\npreconditions.\r\n\r\nThe Study Group recognizes that U.S. relationships with Iran and Syria\r\ninvolve difficult issues that must be resolved. Diplomatic talks\r\nshould be extensive and substantive, and they will require a balancing\r\nof interests. The United States has diplomatic, economic, and military\r\ndisincentives available in approaches to both Iran and Syria. However,\r\nthe United States should also consider incentives to try to engage\r\nthem constructively, much as it did successfully with Libya.\r\n\r\nSome of the possible incentives to Iran, Syria, or both include:\r\n\r\ni. An Iraq that does not disintegrate and destabilize its neighbors\r\nand the region.\r\n\r\nii. The continuing role of the United States in preventing the Taliban\r\nfrom destabilizing Afghanistan.\r\n\r\niii. Accession to international organizations, including the World\r\nTrade Organization.\r\n\r\niv. Prospects for enhanced diplomatic relations with the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nv. The prospect of a U.S. policy that emphasizes political and\r\neconomic reforms instead of (as Iran now perceives it) advocating\r\nregime change.\r\n\r\nvi. Prospects for a real, complete, and secure peace to be negotiated\r\nbetween Israel and Syria, with U.S. involvement as part of a broader\r\ninitiative on Arab-Israeli peace as outlined below.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 9: Under the aegis of the New Diplomatic Offensive and\r\nthe Support Group, the United States should engage directly with Iran\r\nand Syria in order to try to obtain their commitment to constructive\r\npolicies toward Iraq and other regional issues. In engaging Syria and\r\nIran, the United States should consider incentives, as well as\r\ndisincentives, in seeking constructive results.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRAN. Engaging Iran is problematic, especially given the state of the\r\nU.S.-Iranian relationship. Yet the United States and Iran cooperated\r\nin Afghanistan, and both sides should explore whether this model can\r\nbe replicated in the case of Iraq.\r\n\r\nAlthough Iran sees it in its interest to have the United States bogged\r\ndown in Iraq, Iran's interests would not be served by a failure of\r\nU.S. policy in Iraq that led to chaos and the territorial\r\ndisintegration of the Iraqi state. Iran's population is slightly more\r\nthan 50 percent Persian, but it has a large Azeri minority (24 percent\r\nof the population) as well as Kurdish and Arab minorities. Worst-case\r\nscenarios in Iraq could inflame sectarian tensions within Iran, with\r\nserious consequences for Iranian national security interests.\r\n\r\nOur limited contacts with Iran's government lead us to believe that\r\nits leaders are likely to say they will not participate in diplomatic\r\nefforts to support stability in Iraq. They attribute this reluctance\r\nto their belief that the United States seeks regime change in Iran.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as one of Iraq's neighbors Iran should be asked to\r\nassume its responsibility to participate in the Support Group. An\r\nIranian refusal to do so would demonstrate to Iraq and the rest of the\r\nworld Iran's rejectionist attitude and approach, which could lead to\r\nits isolation. Further, Iran's refusal to cooperate on this matter\r\nwould diminish its prospects of engaging with the United States in the\r\nbroader dialogue it seeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 10: The issue of Iran's nuclear programs should\r\ncontinue to be dealt with by the United Nations Security Council and\r\nits five permanent members (i.e., the United States, United Kingdom,\r\nFrance, Russia, and China) plus Germany.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 11: Diplomatic efforts within the Support Group should\r\nseek to persuade Iran that it should take specific steps to improve\r\nthe situation in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAmong steps Iran could usefully take are the following:\r\n\r\n--Iran should stem the flow of equipment, technology, and training to\r\nany group resorting to violence in Iraq.\r\n\r\n--Iran should make clear its support for the territorial integrity of\r\nIraq as a unified state, as well as its respect for the sovereignty of\r\nIraq and its government.\r\n\r\n--Iran can use its influence, especially over Shia groups in Iraq, to\r\nencourage national reconciliation.\r\n\r\n--Iran can also, in the right circumstances, help in the economic\r\nreconstruction of Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRIA. Although the U.S.-Syrian relationship is at a low point, both\r\ncountries have important interests in the region that could be\r\nenhanced if they were able to establish some common ground on how to\r\nmove forward. This approach worked effectively in the early 1990s. In\r\nthis context, Syria's national interests in the Arab-Israeli dispute\r\nare important and can be brought into play.\r\n\r\nSyria can make a major contribution to Iraq's stability in several\r\nways. Accordingly, the Study Group recommends the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 12: The United States and the Support Group should\r\nencourage and persuade Syria of the merit of such contributions as the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n--Syria can control its border with Iraq to the maximum extent\r\npossible and work together with Iraqis on joint patrols on the border.\r\nDoing so will help stem the flow of funding, insurgents, and\r\nterrorists in and out of Iraq.\r\n\r\n--Syria can establish hotlines to exchange information with the\r\nIraqis.\r\n\r\n--Syria can increase its political and economic cooperation with Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Wider Regional Context\r\n\r\nThe United States will not be able to achieve its goals in the Middle\r\nEast unless the United States deals directly with the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nThere must be a renewed and sustained commitment by the United States\r\nto a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts: Lebanon, Syria,\r\nand President Bush's June 2002 commitment to a two-state solution for\r\nIsrael and Palestine. This commitment must include direct talks with,\r\nby, and between Israel, Lebanon, Palestinians (those who accept\r\nIsrael's right to exist), and particularly Syria--which is the\r\nprincipal transit point for shipments of weapons to Hezbollah, and\r\nwhich supports radical Palestinian groups.\r\n\r\nThe United States does its ally Israel no favors in avoiding direct\r\ninvolvement to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict. For several reasons,\r\nwe should act boldly:\r\n\r\n--There is no military solution to this conflict.\r\n\r\n--The vast majority of the Israeli body politic is tired of being a\r\nnation perpetually at war.\r\n\r\n--No American administration--Democratic or Republican--will ever\r\nabandon Israel.\r\n\r\n--Political engagement and dialogue are essential in the Arab-Israeli\r\ndispute because it is an axiom that when the political process breaks\r\ndown there will be violence on the ground.\r\n\r\n--The only basis on which peace can be achieved is that set forth in\r\nUN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and in the principle of\r\n\"land for peace.\"\r\n\r\n--The only lasting and secure peace will be a negotiated peace such as\r\nIsrael has achieved with Egypt and Jordan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis effort would strongly support moderate Arab governments in the\r\nregion, especially the democratically elected government of Lebanon,\r\nand the Palestinian Authority under President Mahmoud Abbas.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 13: There must be a renewed and sustained commitment by\r\nthe United States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts:\r\nLebanon and Syria, and President Bush's June 2002 commitment to a\r\ntwo-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 14: This effort should include--as soon as possible--the\r\nunconditional calling and holding of meetings, under the auspices\r\nof the United States or the Quartet (i.e., the United States, Russia,\r\nEuropean Union, and the United Nations), between Israel and Lebanon\r\nand Syria on the one hand, and Israel and Palestinians (who\r\nacknowledge Israel's right to exist) on the other. The purpose of\r\nthese meetings would be to negotiate peace as was done at the Madrid\r\nConference in 1991, and on two separate tracks--one Syrian/Lebanese,\r\nand the other Palestinian.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 15: Concerning Syria, some elements of that negotiated\r\npeace should be: be:\r\n\r\n--Syria's full adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 1701 of\r\nAugust 2006, which provides the framework for Lebanon to regain\r\nsovereign control over its territory.\r\n\r\n--Syria's full cooperation with all investigations into political\r\nassassinations in Lebanon, especially those of Rafik Hariri and Pierre\r\nGemayel.\r\n\r\n--A verifiable cessation of Syrian aid to Hezbollah and the use of\r\nSyrian territory for transshipment of Iranian weapons and aid to\r\nHezbollah. (This step would do much to solve Israel's problem with\r\nHezbollah.)\r\n\r\n--Syria's use of its influence with Hamas and Hezbollah for the\r\nrelease of the captured Israeli Defense Force soldiers.\r\n\r\n--A verifiable cessation of Syrian efforts to undermine the\r\ndemocratically elected government of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n--A verifiable cessation of arms shipments from or transiting through\r\nSyria for Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups.\r\n\r\n--A Syrian commitment to help obtain from Hamas an acknowledgment of\r\nIsrael's right to exist.\r\n\r\n--Greater Syrian efforts to seal its border with Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 16: In exchange for these actions and in the context of\r\na full and secure peace agreement, the Israelis should return the\r\nGolan Heights, with a U.S. security guarantee for Israel that could\r\ninclude an international force on the border, including U.S. troops if\r\nrequested by both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 17: Concerning the Palestinian issue, elements of that\r\nnegotiated peace should include:\r\n\r\n--Adherence to UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and to the\r\nprinciple of land for peace, which are the only bases for achieving\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n--Strong support for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the\r\nPalestinian Authority to take the lead in preparing the way for\r\nnegotiations with Israel.\r\n\r\n--A major effort to move from the current hostilities by consolidating\r\nthe cease-fire reached between the Palestinians and the Israelis in\r\nNovember 2006.\r\n\r\n--Support for a Palestinian national unity government.\r\n\r\n--Sustainable negotiations leading to a final peace settlement along\r\nthe lines of President Bush's two-state solution, which would address\r\nthe key final status issues of borders, settlements, Jerusalem, the\r\nright of return, and the end of conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfghanistan\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we must not lose sight of the importance of the\r\nsituation inside Afghanistan and the renewed threat posed by the\r\nTaliban. Afghanistan's borders are porous. If the Taliban were to\r\ncontrol more of Afghanistan, it could provide al Qaeda the political\r\nspace to conduct terrorist operations. This development would\r\ndestabilize the region and have national security implications for the\r\nUnited States and other countries around the world. Also, the\r\nsignificant increase in poppy production in Afghanistan fuels the\r\nillegal drug trade and narco-terrorism.\r\n\r\nThe huge focus of U.S. political, military, and economic support on\r\nIraq has necessarily diverted attention from Afghanistan. As the\r\nUnited States develops its approach toward Iraq and the Middle East,\r\nit must also give priority to the situation in Afghanistan. Doing so\r\nmay require increased political, security, and military measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 18: It is critical for the United States to provide\r\nadditional political, economic, and military support for Afghanistan,\r\nincluding resources that might become available as combat forces are\r\nmoved from Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The Internal Approach: Helping Iraqis Help Themselves\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Diplomatic Offensive will provide the proper external\r\nenvironment and support for the difficult internal steps that the\r\nIraqi government must take to promote national reconciliation,\r\nestablish security, and make progress on governance.\r\n\r\nThe most important issues facing Iraq's future are now the\r\nresponsibility of Iraq's elected leaders. Because of the security and\r\nassistance it provides, the United States has a significant role to\r\nplay. Yet only the government and people of Iraq can make and sustain\r\ncertain decisions critical to Iraq's future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Performance on Milestones\r\n\r\nThe United States should work closely with Iraq's leaders to support\r\nthe achievement of specific objectives--or milestones--on national\r\nreconciliation, security, and governance. Miracles cannot be expected,\r\nbut the people of Iraq have the right to expect action and progress.\r\nThe Iraqi government needs to show its own citizens--and the citizens\r\nof the United States and other countries--that it deserves continued\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. government must make clear that it expects action by the\r\nIraqi government to make substantial progress toward these milestones.\r\nSuch a message can be sent only at the level of our national leaders,\r\nand only in person, during direct consultation.\r\n\r\nAs President Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Maliki in Amman,\r\nJordan demonstrates, it is important for the President to remain in\r\nclose and frequent contact with the Iraqi leadership. There is no\r\nsubstitute for sustained dialogue at the highest levels of government.\r\n\r\nDuring these high-level exchanges, the United States should lay out an\r\nagenda for continued support to help Iraq achieve milestones, as well\r\nas underscoring the consequences if Iraq does not act. It should be\r\nunambiguous that continued U.S. political, military, and economic\r\nsupport for Iraq depends on the Iraqi government's demonstrating\r\npolitical will and making substantial progress toward the achievement\r\nof milestones on national reconciliation, security, and governance.\r\nThe transfer of command and control over Iraqi security forces units\r\nfrom the United States to Iraq should be influenced by Iraq's\r\nperformance on milestones.\r\n\r\nThe United States should also signal that it is seeking broad\r\ninternational support for Iraq on behalf of achieving these\r\nmilestones. The United States can begin to shape a positive climate\r\nfor its diplomatic efforts, internationally and within Iraq, through\r\npublic statements by President Bush that reject the notion that the\r\nUnited States seeks to control Iraq's oil, or seeks permanent military\r\nbases within Iraq. However, the United States could consider a request\r\nfrom Iraq for temporary bases.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 19: The President and the leadership of his national\r\nsecurity team should remain in close and frequent contact with the\r\nIraqi leadership. These contacts must convey a clear message: there\r\nmust be action by the Iraqi government to make substantial progress\r\ntoward the achievement of milestones. In public diplomacy, the\r\nPresident should convey as much detail as possible about the substance\r\nof these exchanges in order to keep the American people, the Iraqi\r\npeople, and the countries in the region well informed.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 20: If the Iraqi government demonstrates political will\r\nand makes substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on\r\nnational reconciliation, security, and governance, the United States\r\nshould make clear its willingness to continue training, assistance,\r\nand support for Iraq's security forces, and to continue political,\r\nmilitary, and economic support for the Iraqi government. As Iraq\r\nbecomes more capable of governing, defending, and sustaining itself,\r\nthe U.S. military and civilian presence in Iraq can be reduced.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 21: If the Iraqi government does not make substantial\r\nprogress toward the achievement of milestones on national\r\nreconciliation, security, and governance, the United States should\r\nreduce its political, military, or economic support for the Iraqi\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 22: The President should state that the United States\r\ndoes not seek permanent military bases in Iraq. If the Iraqi\r\ngovernment were to request a temporary base or bases, then the U.S.\r\ngovernment could consider that request as it would in the case of any\r\nother government.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 23: The President should restate that the United States\r\ndoes not seek to control Iraq's oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilestones for Iraq\r\n\r\nThe government of Iraq understands that dramatic steps are necessary\r\nto avert a downward spiral and make progress. Prime Minister Maliki\r\nhas worked closely in consultation with the United States and has put\r\nforward the following milestones in the key areas of national\r\nreconciliation, security and governance:\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL RECONCILIATION\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2006-early 2007:\r\n\r\nApproval of the Provincial Election Law and setting an election date\r\n\r\nApproval of the Petroleum Law\r\n\r\nApproval of the De-Baathification Law\r\n\r\nApproval of the Militia Law\r\n\r\n\r\nBy March 2007:\r\n\r\nA referendum on constitutional amendments (if it is necessary)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy May 2007:\r\n\r\nCompletion of Militia Law implementation\r\n\r\nApproval of amnesty agreement\r\n\r\nCompletion of reconciliation efforts\r\n\r\n\r\nBy June 2007:\r\n\r\nProvincial elections\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITY (pending joint U.S.-Iraqi review)\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2006:\r\n\r\nIraqi increase of 2007 security spending over 2006 levels\r\n\r\nBy April 2007:\r\n\r\nIraqi control of the Army\r\n\r\nBy September 2007:\r\n\r\nIraqi control of provinces\r\n\r\nBy December 2007:\r\n\r\nIraqi security self-reliance (with U.S. support)\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNANCE\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2006:\r\n\r\nThe Central Bank of Iraq will raise interest rates to 20 percent and\r\nappreciate the Iraqi dinar by 10 percent to combat accelerating\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\nIraq will continue increasing domestic prices for refined petroleum\r\nproducts and sell imported fuel at market prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 24: The contemplated completion dates of the end of\r\n2006 or early 2007 for some milestones may not be realistic. These\r\nshould be completed by the first quarter of 2007.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 25: These milestones are a good start. The United\r\nStates should consult closely with the Iraqi government and develop\r\nadditional milestones in three areas: national reconciliation,\r\nsecurity, and improving government services affecting the daily lives\r\nof Iraqis. As with the current milestones, these additional milestones\r\nshould be tied to calendar dates to the fullest extent possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. National Reconciliation\r\n\r\nNational reconciliation is essential to reduce further violence and\r\nmaintain the unity of Iraq.\r\n\r\nU.S. forces can help provide stability for a time to enable Iraqi\r\nleaders to negotiate political solutions, but they cannot stop the\r\nviolence--or even contain it--if there is no underlying political\r\nagreement among Iraqis about the future of their country.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi government must send a clear signal to Sunnis that there is\r\na place for them in national life. The government needs to act now, to\r\ngive a signal of hope. Unless Sunnis believe they can get a fair deal\r\nin Iraq through the political process, there is no prospect that the\r\ninsurgency will end. To strike this fair deal, the Iraqi government\r\nand the Iraqi people must address several issues that are critical to\r\nthe success of national reconciliation and thus to the future of Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps for Iraq to Take on Behalf of National Reconciliation\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 26: Constitution review. Review of the constitution is\r\nessential to national reconciliation and should be pursued on an\r\nurgent basis. The United Nations has expertise in this field, and\r\nshould play a role in this process.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 27: De-Baathification. Political reconciliation\r\nrequires the reintegration of Baathists and Arab nationalists into\r\nnational life, with the leading figures of Saddam Hussein's regime\r\nexcluded. The United States should encourage the return of qualified\r\nIraqi professionals--Sunni or Shia, nationalist or ex-Baathist, Kurd\r\nor Turkmen or Christian or Arab--into the government.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 28: Oil revenue sharing. Oil revenues should accrue to\r\nthe central government and be shared on the basis of population. No\r\nformula that gives control over revenues from future fields to the\r\nregions or gives control of oil fields to the regions is compatible\r\nwith national reconciliation.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 29: Provincial elections. Provincial elections should\r\nbe held at the earliest possible date. Under the constitution, new\r\nprovincial elections should have been held already. They are necessary\r\nto restore representative government.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 30: Kirkuk. Given the very dangerous situation in\r\nKirkuk, international arbitration is necessary to avert communal\r\nviolence. Kirkuk's mix of Kurdish, Arab, and Turkmen populations could\r\nmake it a powder keg. A referendum on the future of Kirkuk (as\r\nrequired by the Iraqi Constitution before the end of 2007) would be\r\nexplosive and should be delayed. This issue should be placed on the\r\nagenda of the International Iraq Support Group as part of the New\r\nDiplomatic Offensive.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 31: Amnesty. Amnesty proposals must be far-reaching.\r\nAny successful effort at national reconciliation must involve those in\r\nthe government finding ways and means to reconcile with former bitter\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 32: Minorities. The rights of women and the rights of\r\nall minority communities in Iraq, including Turkmen, Chaldeans,\r\nAssyrians, Yazidis, Sabeans, and Armenians, must be protected.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 33: Civil society. The Iraqi government should stop\r\nusing the process of registering nongovernmental organizations as a\r\ntool for politicizing or stopping their activities. Registration\r\nshould be solely an administrative act, not an occasion for government\r\ncensorship and interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps for the United States to Take on Behalf of National\r\nReconciliation\r\n\r\nThe United States can take several steps to assist in Iraq's\r\nreconciliation process.\r\n\r\nThe presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is a key topic of interest in a\r\nnational reconciliation dialogue. The point is not for the United\r\nStates to set timetables or deadlines for withdrawal, an approach that\r\nwe oppose. The point is for the United States and Iraq to make clear\r\ntheir shared interest in the orderly departure of U.S. forces as Iraqi\r\nforces take on the security mission. A successful national\r\nreconciliation dialogue will advance that departure date.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 34: The question of the future U.S. force presence must\r\nbe on the table for discussion as the national reconciliation dialogue\r\ntakes place. Its inclusion will increase the likelihood of\r\nparticipation by insurgents and militia leaders, and thereby increase\r\nthe possibilities for success.\r\n\r\nViolence cannot end unless dialogue begins, and the dialogue must\r\ninvolve those who wield power, not simply those who hold political\r\noffice. The United States must try to talk directly to Grand Ayatollah\r\nSistani and must consider appointing a high-level American Shia Muslim\r\nto serve as an emissary to him. The United States must also try to\r\ntalk directly to Moqtada al-Sadr, to militia leaders, and to insurgent\r\nleaders. The United Nations can help facilitate contacts.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 35: The United States must make active efforts to\r\nengage all parties in Iraq, with the exception of al Qaeda. The United\r\nStates must find a way to talk to Grand Ayatollah Sistani, Moqtada\r\nal-Sadr, and militia and insurgent leaders.\r\n\r\nThe very focus on sectarian identity that endangers Iraq also presents\r\nopportunities to seek broader support for a national reconciliation\r\ndialogue. Working with Iraqi leaders, the international community and\r\nreligious leaders can play an important role in fostering dialogue and\r\nreconciliation across the sectarian divide. The United States should\r\nactively encourage the constructive participation of all who can take\r\npart in advancing national reconciliation within Iraq.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 36: The United States should encourage dialogue between\r\nsectarian communities, as outlined in the New Diplomatic Offensive\r\nabove. It should press religious leaders inside and outside Iraq to\r\nspeak out on behalf of peace and reconciliation.\r\n\r\nFinally, amnesty proposals from the Iraqi government are an important\r\nincentive in reconciliation talks and they need to be generous.\r\nAmnesty proposals to once-bitter enemies will be difficult for the\r\nUnited States to accept, just as they will be difficult for the Iraqis\r\nto make. Yet amnesty is an issue to be grappled with by the Iraqis,\r\nnot by Americans. Despite being politically unpopular--in the United\r\nStates as well as in Iraq--amnesty is essential if progress is to take\r\nplace. Iraqi leaders need to be certain that they have U.S. support as\r\nthey move forward with this critical element of national\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 37: Iraqi amnesty proposals must not be undercut in\r\nWashington by either the executive or the legislative branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitias and National Reconciliation\r\n\r\nThe use of force by the government of Iraq is appropriate and\r\nnecessary to stop militias that act as death squads or use violence\r\nagainst institutions of the state. However, solving the problem of\r\nmilitias requires national reconciliation.\r\n\r\nDealing with Iraq's militias will require long-term attention, and\r\nsubstantial funding will be needed to disarm, demobilize, and\r\nreintegrate militia members into civilian society. Around the world,\r\nthis process of transitioning members of irregular military forces\r\nfrom civil conflict to new lives once a peace settlement takes hold is\r\nfamiliar. The disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of\r\nmilitias depends on national reconciliation and on confidence-building\r\nmeasures among the parties to that reconciliation.\r\n\r\nBoth the United Nations and expert and experienced nongovernmental\r\norganizations, especially the International Organization for\r\nMigration, must be on the ground with appropriate personnel months\r\nbefore any program to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate militia\r\nmembers begins. Because the United States is a party to the conflict,\r\nthe U.S. military should not be involved in implementing such a\r\nprogram. Yet U.S. financial and technical support is crucial.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 38: The United States should support the presence of\r\nneutral international experts as advisors to the Iraqi government on\r\nthe processes of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 39: The United States should provide financial and\r\ntechnical support and establish a single office in Iraq to coordinate\r\nassistance to the Iraqi government and its expert advisors to aid a\r\nprogram to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate militia members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Security and Military Forces\r\n\r\nA Military Strategy for Iraq\r\n\r\nThere is no action the American military can take that, by itself, can\r\nbring about success in Iraq. But there are actions that the U.S. and\r\nIraqi governments, working together, can and should take to increase\r\nthe probability of avoiding disaster there, and increase the chance of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi government should accelerate the urgently needed national\r\nreconciliation program to which it has already committed. And it\r\nshould accelerate assuming responsibility for Iraqi security by\r\nincreasing the number and quality of Iraqi Army brigades. As the Iraqi\r\nArmy increases in size and capability, the Iraqi government should be\r\nable to take real responsibility for governance.\r\n\r\nWhile this process is under way, and to facilitate it, the United\r\nStates should significantly increase the number of U.S. military\r\npersonnel, including combat troops, imbedded in and supporting Iraqi\r\nArmy units. As these actions proceed, we could begin to move combat\r\nforces out of Iraq. The primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should\r\nevolve to one of supporting the Iraqi army, which would take over\r\nprimary responsibility for combat operations. We should continue to\r\nmaintain support forces, rapid-reaction forces, special operations\r\nforces, intelligence units, search-and-rescue units, and force\r\nprotection units.\r\n\r\nWhile the size and composition of the Iraqi Army is ultimately a\r\nmatter for the Iraqi government to determine, we should be firm on the\r\nurgent near-term need for significant additional trained Army\r\nbrigades, since this is the key to Iraqis taking over full\r\nresponsibility for their own security, which they want to do and which\r\nwe need them to do. It is clear that they will still need security\r\nassistance from the United States for some time to come as they work\r\nto achieve political and security changes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important elements of our support would be the\r\nimbedding of substantially more U.S. military personnel in all Iraqi\r\nArmy battalions and brigades, as well as within Iraqi companies. U.S.\r\npersonnel would provide advice, combat assistance, and staff\r\nassistance. The training of Iraqi units by the United States has\r\nimproved and should continue for the coming year. In addition to this\r\ntraining, Iraqi combat units need supervised on-the-job training as\r\nthey move to field operations. This on-the-job training could be best\r\ndone by imbedding more U.S. military personnel in Iraqi deployed\r\nunits. The number of imbedded personnel would be based on the\r\nrecommendation of our military commanders in Iraq, but it should be\r\nlarge enough to accelerate the development of a real combat capability\r\nin Iraqi Army units. Such a mission could involve 10,000 to 20,000\r\nAmerican troops instead of the 3,000 to 4,000 now in this role. This\r\nincrease in imbedded troops could be carried out without an aggregate\r\nincrease over time in the total number of troops in Iraq by making a\r\ncorresponding decrease in troops assigned to U.S. combat brigades.\r\n\r\nAnother mission of the U.S. military would be to assist Iraqi deployed\r\nbrigades with intelligence, transportation, air support, and logistics\r\nsupport, as well as providing some key equipment.\r\n\r\nA vital mission of the U.S. military would be to maintain\r\nrapid-reaction teams and special operations teams. These teams would be\r\navailable to undertake strike missions against al Qaeda in Iraq when\r\nthe opportunity arises, as well as for other missions considered vital\r\nby the U.S. commander in Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the Iraqi Army could also be significantly improved\r\nif it had improved equipment. One source could be equipment left\r\nbehind by departing U.S. units. The quickest and most effective way\r\nfor the Iraqi Army to get the bulk of their equipment would be through\r\nour Foreign Military Sales program, which they have already begun to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nWhile these efforts are building up, and as additional Iraqi brigades\r\nare being deployed, U.S. combat brigades could begin to move out of\r\nIraq. By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments\r\nin the security situation on the ground, all combat brigades not\r\nnecessary for force protection could be out of Iraq. At that time,\r\nU.S. combat forces in Iraq could be deployed only in units embedded\r\nwith Iraqi forces, in rapid-reaction and special operations teams, and\r\nin training, equipping, advising, force protection, and search and\r\nrescue. Intelligence and support efforts would continue. Even after\r\nthe United States has moved all combat brigades out of Iraq, we would\r\nmaintain a considerable military presence in the region, with our\r\nstill significant force in Iraq and with our powerful air, ground, and\r\nnaval deployments in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar, as well as an\r\nincreased presence in Afghanistan. These forces would be sufficiently\r\nrobust to permit the United States, working with the Iraqi government,\r\nto accomplish four missions:\r\n\r\n--Provide political reassurance to the Iraqi government in order to\r\navoid its collapse and the disintegration of the country.\r\n\r\n--Fight al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations in Iraq using\r\nspecial operations teams.\r\n\r\n--Train, equip, and support the Iraqi security forces.\r\n\r\n--Deter even more destructive interference in Iraq by Syria and Iran.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the importance of Iraq to our regional security goals and\r\nto our ongoing fight against al Qaeda, we considered proposals to make\r\na substantial increase (100,000 to 200,000) in the number of U.S.\r\ntroops in Iraq. We rejected this course because we do not believe that\r\nthe needed levels are available for a sustained deployment. Further,\r\nadding more American troops could conceivably worsen those aspects of\r\nthe security problem that are fed by the view that the U.S. presence\r\nis intended to be a long-term \"occupation.\" We could, however, support\r\na short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to\r\nstabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping mission,\r\nif the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nWe also rejected the immediate withdrawal of our troops, because we\r\nbelieve that so much is at stake.\r\n\r\nWe believe that our recommended actions will give the Iraqi Army the\r\nsupport it needs to have a reasonable chance to take responsibility\r\nfor Iraq's security. Given the ongoing deterioration in the security\r\nsituation, it is urgent to move as quickly as possible to have that\r\nsecurity role taken over by Iraqi security forces.\r\n\r\nThe United States should not make an open-ended commitment to keep\r\nlarge numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq for three compelling\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, and most importantly, the United States faces other security\r\ndangers in the world, and a continuing Iraqi commitment of American\r\nground forces at present levels will leave no reserve available to\r\nmeet other contingencies. On September 7, 2006, General James Jones,\r\nour NATO commander, called for more troops in Afghanistan, where U.S.\r\nand NATO forces are fighting a resurgence of al Qaeda and Taliban\r\nforces. The United States should respond positively to that request,\r\nand be prepared for other security contingencies, including those in\r\nIran and North Korea.\r\n\r\nSecond, the long-term commitment of American ground forces to Iraq at\r\ncurrent levels is adversely affecting Army readiness, with less than a\r\nthird of the Army units currently at high readiness levels. The Army\r\nis unlikely to be able to meet the next rotation of troops in Iraq\r\nwithout undesirable changes in its deployment practices. The Army is\r\nnow considering breaking its compact with the National Guard and\r\nReserves that limits the number of years that these citizen-soldiers\r\ncan be deployed. Behind this short-term strain is the longer-term risk\r\nthat the ground forces will be impaired in ways that will take years\r\nto reverse.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, an open-ended commitment of American forces would not\r\nprovide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take the\r\npolitical actions that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian\r\nviolence. In the absence of such an incentive, the Iraqi government\r\nmight continue to delay taking those difficult actions.\r\n\r\nWhile it is clear that the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq is\r\nmoderating the violence, there is little evidence that the long-term\r\ndeployment of U.S. troops by itself has led or will lead to\r\nfundamental improvements in the security situation. It is important to\r\nrecognize that there are no risk-free alternatives available to the\r\nUnited States at this time. Reducing our combat troop commitments in\r\nIraq, whenever that occurs, undeniably creates risks, but leaving\r\nthose forces tied down in Iraq indefinitely creates its own set of\r\nsecurity risks.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 40: The United States should not make an open-ended\r\ncommitment to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 41: The United States must make it clear to the Iraqi\r\ngovernment that the United States could carry out its plans, including\r\nplanned redeployments, even if Iraq does not implement its planned\r\nchanges. America's other security needs and the future of our military\r\ncannot be made hostage to the actions or inactions of the Iraqi\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 42: We should seek to complete the training and\r\nequipping mission by the first quarter of 2008, as stated by General\r\nGeorge Casey on October 24, 2006.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 43: Military priorities in Iraq must change, with the\r\nhighest priority given to the training, equipping, advising, and\r\nsupport mission and to counterterrorism operations.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 44: The most highly qualified U.S. officers and\r\nmilitary personnel should be assigned to the imbedded teams, and\r\nAmerican teams should be present with Iraqi units down to the company\r\nlevel. The U.S. military should establish suitable career-enhancing\r\nincentives for these officers and personnel.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 45: The United States should support more and better\r\nequipment for the Iraqi Army by encouraging the Iraqi government to\r\naccelerate its Foreign Military Sales requests and, as American combat\r\nbrigades move out of Iraq, by leaving behind some American equipment\r\nfor Iraqi forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestoring the U.S. Military\r\n\r\nWe recognize that there are other results of the war in Iraq that have\r\ngreat consequence for our nation. One consequence has been the stress\r\nand uncertainty imposed on our military--the most professional and\r\nproficient military in history. The United States will need its\r\nmilitary to protect U.S. security regardless of what happens in Iraq.\r\nWe therefore considered how to limit the adverse consequences of the\r\nstrain imposed on our military by the Iraq war.\r\n\r\nU.S. military forces, especially our ground forces, have been\r\nstretched nearly to the breaking point by the repeated deployments in\r\nIraq, with attendant casualties (almost 3,000 dead and more than\r\n21,000 wounded), greater difficulty in recruiting, and accelerated\r\nwear on equipment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the defense budget as a whole is in danger of disarray,\r\nas supplemental funding winds down and reset costs become clear. It\r\nwill be a major challenge to meet ongoing requirements for other\r\ncurrent and future security threats that need to be accommodated\r\ntogether with spending for operations and maintenance, reset,\r\npersonnel, and benefits for active duty and retired personnel.\r\nRestoring the capability of our military forces should be a high\r\npriority for the United States at this time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. military has a long tradition of strong partnership between\r\nthe civilian leadership of the Department of Defense and the uniformed\r\nservices. Both have long benefited from a relationship in which the\r\ncivilian leadership exercises control with the advantage of fully\r\ncandid professional advice, and the military serves loyally with the\r\nunderstanding that its advice has been heard and valued. That\r\ntradition has frayed, and civil-military relations need to be\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 46: The new Secretary of Defense should make every\r\neffort to build healthy civil-military relations, by creating an\r\nenvironment in which the senior military feel free to offer\r\nindependent advice not only to the civilian leadership in the Pentagon\r\nbut also to the President and the National Security Council, as\r\nenvisioned in the Goldwater-Nichols legislation.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 47: As redeployment proceeds, the Pentagon leadership\r\nshould emphasize training and education programs for the forces that\r\nhave returned to the continental United States in order to \"reset\" the\r\nforce and restore the U.S. military to a high level of readiness for\r\nglobal contingencies.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 48: As equipment returns to the United States, Congress\r\nshould appropriate sufficient funds to restore the equipment to full\r\nfunctionality over the next five years.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 49: The administration, in full consultation with the\r\nrelevant committees of Congress, should assess the full future\r\nbudgetary impact of the war in Iraq and its potential impact on the\r\nfuture readiness of the force, the ability to recruit and retain\r\nhigh-quality personnel, needed investments in procurement and in research\r\nand development, and the budgets of other U.S. government agencies\r\ninvolved in the stability and reconstruction effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Police and Criminal Justice\r\n\r\nThe problems in the Iraqi police and criminal justice system are\r\nprofound.\r\n\r\nThe ethos and training of Iraqi police forces must support the mission\r\nto \"protect and serve\" all Iraqis. Today, far too many Iraqi police do\r\nnot embrace that mission, in part because of problems in how reforms\r\nwere organized and implemented by the Iraqi and U.S. governments.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended Iraqi Actions\r\n\r\nWithin Iraq, the failure of the police to restore order and prevent\r\nmilitia infiltration is due, in part, to the poor organization of\r\nIraq's component police forces: the Iraqi National Police, the Iraqi\r\nBorder Police, and the Iraqi Police Service.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi National Police pursue a mission that is more military than\r\ndomestic in nature--involving commando-style operations--and is thus\r\nill-suited to the Ministry of the Interior. The more natural home for\r\nthe National Police is within the Ministry of Defense, which should be\r\nthe authority for counterinsurgency operations and heavily armed\r\nforces. Though depriving the Ministry of the Interior of operational\r\nforces, this move will place the Iraqi National Police under better\r\nand more rigorous Iraqi and U.S. supervision and will enable these\r\nunits to better perform their counterinsurgency mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 50: The entire Iraqi National Police should be\r\ntransferred to the Ministry of Defense, where the police commando\r\nunits will become part of the new Iraqi Army.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Iraqi Border Police are charged with a role that bears\r\nlittle resemblance to ordinary policing, especially in light of the\r\ncurrent flow of foreign fighters, insurgents, and weaponry across\r\nIraq's borders and the need for joint patrols of the border with\r\nforeign militaries. Thus the natural home for the Border Police is\r\nwithin the Ministry of Defense, which should be the authority for\r\ncontrolling Iraq's borders.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 51: The entire Iraqi Border Police should be\r\ntransferred to the Ministry of Defense, which would have total\r\nresponsibility for border control and external security.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi Police Service, which operates in the provinces and provides\r\nlocal policing, needs to become a true police force. It needs legal\r\nauthority, training, and equipment to control crime and protect Iraqi\r\ncitizens. Accomplishing those goals will not be easy, and the presence\r\nof American advisors will be required to help the Iraqis determine a\r\nnew role for the police.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 52: The Iraqi Police Service should be given greater\r\nresponsibility to conduct criminal investigations and should expand\r\nits cooperation with other elements in the Iraqi judicial system in\r\norder to better control crime and protect Iraqi civilians.\r\n\r\nIn order to more effectively administer the Iraqi Police Service, the\r\nMinistry of the Interior needs to undertake substantial reforms to\r\npurge bad elements and highlight best practices. Once the ministry\r\nbegins to function effectively, it can exert a positive influence over\r\nthe provinces and take back some of the authority that was lost to\r\nlocal governments through decentralization. To reduce corruption and\r\nmilitia infiltration, the Ministry of the Interior should take\r\nauthority from the local governments for the handling of policing\r\nfunds. Doing so will improve accountability and organizational\r\ndiscipline, limit the authority of provincial police officials, and\r\nidentify police officers with the central government.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 53: The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior should undergo a\r\nprocess of organizational transformation, including efforts to expand\r\nthe capability and reach of the current major crime unit (or Criminal\r\nInvestigation Division) and to exert more authority over local police\r\nforces. The sole authority to pay police salaries and disburse\r\nfinancial support to local police should be transferred to the\r\nMinistry of the Interior.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is no alternative to bringing the Facilities Protection\r\nService under the control of the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior.\r\nSimply disbanding these units is not an option, as the members will\r\ntake their weapons and become full-time militiamen or insurgents. All\r\nshould be brought under the authority of a reformed Ministry of the\r\nInterior. They will need to be vetted, retrained, and closely\r\nsupervised. Those who are no longer part of the Facilities Protection\r\nService need to participate in a disarmament, demobilization, and\r\nreintegration program (outlined above).\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 54: The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior should proceed\r\nwith current efforts to identify, register, and control the Facilities\r\nProtection Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. Actions\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi criminal justice system is weak, and the U.S. training\r\nmission has been hindered by a lack of clarity and capacity. It has\r\nnot always been clear who is in charge of the police training mission,\r\nand the U.S. military lacks expertise in certain areas pertaining to\r\npolice and the rule of law. The United States has been more successful\r\nin training the Iraqi Army than it has the police. The U.S. Department\r\nof Justice has the expertise and capacity to carry out the police\r\ntraining mission. The U.S. Department of Defense is already bearing\r\ntoo much of the burden in Iraq. Meanwhile, the pool of expertise in\r\nthe United States on policing and the rule of law has been\r\nunderutilized.\r\n\r\nThe United States should adjust its training mission in Iraq to match\r\nthe recommended changes in the Iraqi government--the movement of the\r\nNational and Border Police to the Ministry of Defense and the new\r\nemphasis on the Iraqi Police Service within the Ministry of the\r\nInterior. To reflect the reorganization, the Department of Defense\r\nwould continue to train the Iraqi National and Border Police, and the\r\nDepartment of Justice would become responsible for training the Iraqi\r\nPolice Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 55: The U.S. Department of Defense should continue its\r\nmission to train the Iraqi National Police and the Iraqi Border\r\nPolice, which should be placed within the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 56: The U.S. Department of Justice should direct the\r\ntraining mission of the police forces remaining under the Ministry of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 57: Just as U.S. military training teams are imbedded\r\nwithin Iraqi Army units, the current practice of imbedding U.S. police\r\ntrainers should be expanded and the numbers of civilian training\r\nofficers increased so that teams can cover all levels of the Iraqi\r\nPolice Service, including local police stations. These trainers should\r\nbe obtained from among experienced civilian police executives and\r\nsupervisors from around the world. These officers would replace the\r\nmilitary police personnel currently assigned to training teams.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided personnel to train\r\nthe Criminal Investigation Division in the Ministry of the Interior,\r\nwhich handles major crimes. The FBI has also fielded a large team\r\nwithin Iraq for counterterrorism activities.\r\n\r\nBuilding on this experience, the training programs should be expanded\r\nand should include the development of forensic investigation training\r\nand facilities that could apply scientific and technical investigative\r\nmethods to counterterrorism as well as to ordinary criminal activity.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 58: The FBI should expand its investigative and\r\nforensic training and facilities within Iraq, to include coverage of\r\nterrorism as well as criminal activity.\r\n\r\nOne of the major deficiencies of the Iraqi Police Service is its lack\r\nof equipment, particularly in the area of communications and motor\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 59: The Iraqi government should provide funds to expand\r\nand upgrade communications equipment and motor vehicles for the Iraqi\r\nPolice Service.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice is also better suited than the Department of\r\nDefense to carry out the mission of reforming Iraq's Ministry of the\r\nInterior and Iraq's judicial system. Iraq needs more than training for\r\ncops on the beat: it needs courts, trained prosecutors and\r\ninvestigators, and the ability to protect Iraqi judicial officials.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 60: The U.S. Department of Justice should lead the work\r\nof organizational transformation in the Ministry of the Interior. This\r\napproach must involve Iraqi officials, starting at senior levels and\r\nmoving down, to create a strategic plan and work out standard\r\nadministrative procedures, codes of conduct, and operational measures\r\nthat Iraqis will accept and use. These plans must be drawn up in\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 61: Programs led by the U.S. Department of Justice to\r\nestablish courts; to train judges, prosecutors, and investigators; and\r\nto create institutions and practices to fight corruption must be\r\nstrongly supported and funded. New and refurbished courthouses with\r\nimproved physical security, secure housing for judges and judicial\r\nstaff, witness protection facilities, and a new Iraqi Marshals Service\r\nare essential parts of a secure and functioning system of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Oil Sector\r\n\r\nSince the success of the oil sector is critical to the success of the\r\nIraqi economy, the United States must do what it can to help Iraq\r\nmaximize its capability.\r\n\r\nIraq, a country with promising oil potential, could restore oil\r\nproduction from existing fields to 3.0 to 3.5 million barrels a day\r\nover a three-to five-year period, depending on evolving conditions in\r\nkey reservoirs. Even if Iraq were at peace tomorrow, oil production\r\nwould decline unless current problems in the oil sector were\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort Term\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 62:\r\n\r\n--As soon as possible, the U.S. government should provide technical\r\nassistance to the Iraqi government to prepare a draft oil law that\r\ndefines the rights of regional and local governments and creates a\r\nfiscal and legal framework for investment. Legal clarity is essential\r\nto attract investment.\r\n\r\n--The U.S. government should encourage the Iraqi government to\r\naccelerate contracting for the comprehensive well work-overs in the\r\nsouthern fields needed to increase production, but the United States\r\nshould no longer fund such infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\n--The U.S. military should work with the Iraqi military and with\r\nprivate security forces to protect oil infrastructure and contractors.\r\nProtective measures could include a program to improve pipeline\r\nsecurity by paying local tribes solely on the basis of throughput\r\n(rather than fixed amounts).\r\n\r\n--Metering should be implemented at both ends of the supply line. This\r\nstep would immediately improve accountability in the oil sector.\r\n\r\n--In conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, the U.S.\r\ngovernment should press Iraq to continue reducing subsidies in the\r\nenergy sector, instead of providing grant assistance. Until Iraqis pay\r\nmarket prices for oil products, drastic fuel shortages will remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Term\r\n\r\nExpanding oil production in Iraq over the long term will require\r\ncreating corporate structures, establishing management systems, and\r\ninstalling competent managers to plan and oversee an ambitious list of\r\nmajor oil-field investment projects.\r\n\r\nTo improve oil-sector performance, the Study Group puts forward the\r\nfollowing recommendations.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 63:\r\n\r\n--The United States should encourage investment in Iraq's oil sector\r\nby the international community and by international energy companies.\r\n\r\n--The United States should assist Iraqi leaders to reorganize the\r\nnational oil industry as a commercial enterprise, in order to enhance\r\nefficiency, transparency, and accountability.\r\n\r\n--To combat corruption, the U.S. government should urge the Iraqi\r\ngovernment to post all oil contracts, volumes, and prices on the Web\r\nso that Iraqis and outside observers can track exports and export\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\n--The United States should support the World Bank's efforts to ensure\r\nthat best practices are used in contracting. This support involves\r\nproviding Iraqi officials with contracting templates and training them\r\nin contracting, auditing, and reviewing audits.\r\n\r\n--The United States should provide technical assistance to the\r\nMinistry of Oil for enhancing maintenance, improving the payments\r\nprocess, managing cash flows, contracting and auditing, and updating\r\nprofessional training programs for management and technical personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. U.S. Economic and Reconstruction Assistance\r\n\r\nBuilding the capacity of the Iraqi government should be at the heart\r\nof U.S. reconstruction efforts, and capacity building demands\r\nadditional U.S. resources.\r\n\r\nProgress in providing essential government services is necessary to\r\nsustain any progress on the political or security front. The period of\r\nlarge U.S.-funded reconstruction projects is over, yet the Iraqi\r\ngovernment is still in great need of technical assistance and advice\r\nto build the capacity of its institutions. The Iraqi government needs\r\nhelp with all aspects of its operations, including improved\r\nprocedures, greater delegation of authority, and better internal\r\ncontrols. The strong emphasis on building capable central ministries\r\nmust be accompanied by efforts to develop functioning, effective\r\nprovincial government institutions with local citizen participation.\r\n\r\nJob creation is also essential. There is no substitute for private-sector\r\njob generation, but the Commander's Emergency Response Program\r\nis a necessary transitional mechanism until security and the economic\r\nclimate improve. It provides immediate economic assistance for trash\r\npickup, water, sewers, and electricity in conjunction with clear,\r\nhold, and build operations, and it should be funded generously. A\r\ntotal of $753 million was appropriated for this program in FY 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 64: U.S. economic assistance should be increased to a\r\nlevel of $5 billion per year rather than being permitted to decline.\r\nThe President needs to ask for the necessary resources and must work\r\nhard to win the support of Congress. Capacity building and job\r\ncreation, including reliance on the Commander's Emergency Response\r\nProgram, should be U.S. priorities. Economic assistance should be\r\nprovided on a nonsectarian basis.\r\n\r\nThe New Diplomatic Offensive can help draw in more international\r\npartners to assist with the reconstruction mission. The United\r\nNations, the World Bank, the European Union, the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, and some Arab League members\r\nneed to become hands-on participants in Iraq's reconstruction.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 65: An essential part of reconstruction efforts in Iraq\r\nshould be greater involvement by and with international partners, who\r\nshould do more than just contribute money. They should also actively\r\nparticipate in the design and construction of projects.\r\n\r\nThe number of refugees and internally displaced persons within Iraq is\r\nincreasing dramatically. If this situation is not addressed, Iraq and\r\nthe region could be further destabilized, and the humanitarian\r\nsuffering could be severe. Funding for international relief efforts is\r\ninsufficient, and should be increased.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 66: The United States should take the lead in funding\r\nassistance requests from the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, and other humanitarian agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoordination of Economic and Reconstruction Assistance\r\n\r\nA lack of coordination by senior management in Washington still\r\nhampers U.S. contributions to Iraq's reconstruction.\r\n\r\nFocus, priority setting, and skillful implementation are in short\r\nsupply. No single official is assigned responsibility or held\r\naccountable for the overall reconstruction effort. Representatives of\r\nkey foreign partners involved in reconstruction have also spoken to us\r\ndirectly and specifically about the need for a point of contact that\r\ncan coordinate their efforts with the U.S. government.\r\n\r\nA failure to improve coordination will result in agencies continuing\r\nto follow conflicting strategies, wasting taxpayer dollars on\r\nduplicative and uncoordinated efforts. This waste will further\r\nundermine public confidence in U.S. policy in Iraq.\r\n\r\nA Senior Advisor for Economic Reconstruction in Iraq is required. He\r\nor she should report to the President, be given a staff and funding,\r\nand chair a National Security Council interagency group consisting of\r\nsenior principals at the undersecretary level from all relevant U.S.\r\ngovernment departments and agencies. The Senior Advisor's\r\nresponsibility must be to bring unity of effort to the policy, budget,\r\nand implementation of economic reconstruction programs in Iraq. The\r\nSenior Advisor must act as the principal point of contact with U.S.\r\npartners in the overall reconstruction effort.\r\n\r\nHe or she must have close and constant interaction with senior U.S.\r\nofficials and military commanders in Iraq, especially the Director of\r\nthe Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office, so that the realities\r\non the ground are brought directly and fully into the policy-making\r\nprocess. In order to maximize the effectiveness of assistance, all\r\ninvolved must be on the same page at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 67: The President should create a Senior Advisor for\r\nEconomic Reconstruction in Iraq. ATION 67: The President should create\r\na Senior Advisor for Economic Reconstruction in Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving the Effectiveness of Assistance Programs\r\n\r\nCongress should work with the administration to improve its ability to\r\nimplement assistance programs in Iraq quickly, flexibly, and\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\nAs opportunities arise, the Chief of Mission in Iraq should have the\r\nauthority to fund quick-disbursing projects to promote national\r\nreconciliation, as well as to rescind funding from programs and\r\nprojects in which the government of Iraq is not demonstrating\r\neffective partnership. These are important tools to improve\r\nperformance and accountability--as is the work of the Special\r\nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 68: The Chief of Mission in Iraq should have the\r\nauthority to spend significant funds through a program structured\r\nalong the lines of the Commander's Emergency Response Program, and\r\nshould have the authority to rescind funding from programs and\r\nprojects in which the government of Iraq is not demonstrating\r\neffective partnership.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 69: The authority of the Special Inspector General for\r\nIraq Reconstruction should be renewed for the duration of assistance\r\nprograms in Iraq.\r\n\r\nU.S. security assistance programs in Iraq are slowed considerably by\r\nthe differing requirements of State and Defense Department programs\r\nand of their respective congressional oversight committees. Since\r\nIraqi forces must be trained and equipped, streamlining the provision\r\nof training and equipment to Iraq is critical. Security assistance\r\nshould be delivered promptly, within weeks of a decision to provide\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 70: A more flexible security assistance program for\r\nIraq, breaking down the barriers to effective interagency cooperation,\r\nshould be authorized and implemented.\r\n\r\nThe United States also needs to break down barriers that discourage\r\nU.S. partnerships with international donors and Iraqi participants to\r\npromote reconstruction. The ability of the United States to form such\r\npartnerships will encourage greater international participation in\r\nIraq.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 71: Authority to merge U.S. funds with those from\r\ninternational donors and Iraqi participants on behalf of assistance\r\nprojects should be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Budget Preparation, Presentation, and Review\r\n\r\nThe public interest is not well served by the government's\r\npreparation, presentation, and review of the budget for the war in\r\nIraq.\r\n\r\nFirst, most of the costs of the war show up not in the normal budget\r\nrequest but in requests for emergency supplemental appropriations.\r\nThis means that funding requests are drawn up outside the normal\r\nbudget process, are not offset by budgetary reductions elsewhere, and\r\nmove quickly to the White House with minimal scrutiny. Bypassing the\r\nnormal review erodes budget discipline and accountability.\r\n\r\nSecond, the executive branch presents budget requests in a confusing\r\nmanner, making it difficult for both the general public and members of\r\nCongress to understand the request or to differentiate it from\r\ncounterterrorism operations around the world or operations in\r\nAfghanistan. Detailed analyses by budget experts are needed to answer\r\nwhat should be a simple question: \"How much money is the President\r\nrequesting for the war in Iraq?\"\r\n\r\nFinally, circumvention of the budget process by the executive branch\r\nerodes oversight and review by Congress. The authorizing committees\r\n(including the House and Senate Armed Services committees) spend the\r\nbetter part of a year reviewing the President's annual budget request.\r\nWhen the President submits an emergency supplemental request, the\r\nauthorizing committees are bypassed. The request goes directly to the\r\nappropriations committees, and they are pressured by the need to act\r\nquickly so that troops in the field do not run out of funds. The\r\nresult is a spending bill that passes Congress with perfunctory\r\nreview. Even worse, the must-pass appropriations bill becomes loaded\r\nwith special spending projects that would not survive the normal\r\nreview process.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 72: Costs for the war in Iraq should be included in the\r\nPresident's annual budget request, starting in FY 2008: the war is in\r\nits fourth year, and the normal budget process should not be\r\ncircumvented. Funding requests for the war in Iraq should be presented\r\nclearly to Congress and the American people. Congress must carry out\r\nits constitutional responsibility to review budget requests for the\r\nwar in Iraq carefully and to conduct oversight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. U.S. Personnel\r\n\r\nThe United States can take several steps to ensure that it has\r\npersonnel with the right skills serving in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAll of our efforts in Iraq, military and civilian, are handicapped by\r\nAmericans' lack of language and cultural understanding. Our embassy of\r\n1,000 has 33 Arabic speakers, just six of whom are at the level of\r\nfluency. In a conflict that demands effective and efficient\r\ncommunication with Iraqis, we are often at a disadvantage. There are\r\nstill far too few Arab language--proficient military and civilian\r\nofficers in Iraq, to the detriment of the U.S. mission.\r\n\r\nCivilian agencies also have little experience with complex overseas\r\ninterventions to restore and maintain order--stability\r\noperations--outside of the normal embassy setting. The nature of the\r\nmission in Iraq is unfamiliar and dangerous, and the United States has\r\nhad great difficulty filling civilian assignments in Iraq with sufficient\r\nnumbers of properly trained personnel at the appropriate rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 73: The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense,\r\nand the Director of National Intelligence should accord the highest\r\npossible priority to professional language proficiency and cultural\r\ntraining, in general and specifically for U.S. officers and personnel\r\nabout to be assigned to Iraq.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 74: In the short term, if not enough civilians\r\nvolunteer to fill key positions in Iraq, civilian agencies must fill\r\nthose positions with directed assignments. Steps should be taken to\r\nmitigate familial or financial hardships posed by directed\r\nassignments, including tax exclusions similar to those authorized for\r\nU.S. military personnel serving in Iraq.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 75: For the longer term, the United States government\r\nneeds to improve how its constituent agencies--Defense, State, Agency\r\nfor International Development, Treasury, Justice, the intelligence\r\ncommunity, and others--respond to a complex stability operation like\r\nthat represented by this decade's Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the\r\nprevious decade's operations in the Balkans. They need to train for,\r\nand conduct, joint operations across agency boundaries, following the\r\nGoldwater-Nichols model that has proved so successful in the U.S.\r\narmed services.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 76: The State Department should train personnel to\r\ncarry out civilian tasks associated with a complex stability operation\r\noutside of the traditional embassy setting. It should establish a\r\nForeign Service Reserve Corps with personnel and expertise to provide\r\nsurge capacity for such an operation. Other key civilian agencies,\r\nincluding Treasury, Justice, and Agriculture, need to create similar\r\ntechnical assistance capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Intelligence\r\n\r\nWhile the United States has been able to acquire good and sometimes\r\nsuperb tactical intelligence on al Qaeda in Iraq, our government still\r\ndoes not understand very well either the insurgency in Iraq or the\r\nrole of the militias.\r\n\r\nA senior commander told us that human intelligence in Iraq has\r\nimproved from 10 percent to 30 percent. Clearly, U.S. intelligence\r\nagencies can and must do better. As mentioned above, an essential part\r\nof better intelligence must be improved language and cultural skills.\r\nAs an intelligence analyst told us, \"We rely too much on others to\r\nbring information to us, and too often don't understand what is\r\nreported back because we do not understand the context of what we are\r\ntold.\"\r\n\r\nThe Defense Department and the intelligence community have not\r\ninvested sufficient people and resources to understand the political\r\nand military threat to American men and women in the armed forces.\r\nCongress has appropriated almost $2 billion this year for\r\ncountermeasures to protect our troops in Iraq against improvised\r\nexplosive devices, but the administration has not put forward a\r\nrequest to invest comparable resources in trying to understand the\r\npeople who fabricate, plant, and explode those devices.\r\n\r\nWe were told that there are fewer than 10 analysts on the job at the\r\nDefense Intelligence Agency who have more than two years' experience\r\nin analyzing the insurgency. Capable analysts are rotated to new\r\nassignments, and on-the-job training begins anew. Agencies must have a\r\nbetter personnel system to keep analytic expertise focused on the\r\ninsurgency. They are not doing enough to map the insurgency, dissect\r\nit, and understand it on a national and provincial level. The analytic\r\ncommunity's knowledge of the organization, leadership, financing, and\r\noperations of militias, as well as their relationship to government\r\nsecurity forces, also falls far short of what policy makers need to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is significant underreporting of the violence in\r\nIraq. The standard for recording attacks acts as a filter to keep\r\nevents out of reports and databases. A murder of an Iraqi is not\r\nnecessarily counted as an attack. If we cannot determine the source of\r\na sectarian attack, that assault does not make it into the database. A\r\nroadside bomb or a rocket or mortar attack that doesn't hurt U.S.\r\npersonnel doesn't count. For example, on one day in July 2006 there\r\nwere 93 attacks or significant acts of violence reported. Yet a\r\ncareful review of the reports for that single day brought to light\r\n1,100 acts of violence. Good policy is difficult to make when\r\ninformation is systematically collected in a way that minimizes its\r\ndiscrepancy with policy goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 77: The Director of National Intelligence and the\r\nSecretary of Defense should devote significantly greater analytic\r\nresources to the task of understanding the threats and sources of\r\nviolence in Iraq.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 78: The Director of National Intelligence and the\r\nSecretary of Defense should also institute immediate changes in the\r\ncollection of data about violence and the sources of violence in Iraq\r\nto provide a more accurate picture of events on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended Iraqi Actions\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi government must improve its intelligence capability,\r\ninitially to work with the United States, and ultimately to take full\r\nresponsibility for this intelligence function.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate enhanced Iraqi intelligence capabilities, the CIA should\r\nincrease its personnel in Iraq to train Iraqi intelligence personnel.\r\nThe CIA should also develop, with Iraqi officials, a counterterrorism\r\nintelligence center for the all-source fusion of information on the\r\nvarious sources of terrorism within Iraq. This center would analyze\r\ndata concerning the individuals, organizations, networks, and support\r\ngroups involved in terrorism within Iraq. It would also facilitate\r\nintelligence-led police and military actions against them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION 79: The CIA should provide additional personnel in Iraq\r\nto develop and train an effective intelligence service and to build a\r\ncounterterrorism intelligence center that will facilitate\r\nintelligence-led counterterrorism efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from the Sponsoring Organizations\r\n\r\nThe initiative for a bipartisan, independent, forward-looking\r\n\"fresh-eyes\" assessment of Iraq emerged from conversations U.S. House\r\nAppropriations Committee Member Frank Wolf had with us. In late 2005,\r\nCongressman Wolf asked the United States Institute of Peace, a\r\nbipartisan federal entity, to facilitate the assessment, in\r\ncollaboration with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy\r\nat Rice University, the Center for the Study of the Presidency, and\r\nthe Center for Strategic and International Studies.\r\n\r\nInterested members of Congress, in consultation with the sponsoring\r\norganizations and the administration, agreed that former Republican\r\nU.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker, III and former Democratic\r\nCongressman Lee H. Hamilton had the breadth of knowledge of foreign\r\naffairs required to co-chair this bipartisan effort. The co-chairs\r\nsubsequently selected the other members of the bipartisan Iraq Study\r\nGroup, all senior individuals with distinguished records of public\r\nservice. Democrats included former Secretary of Defense William J.\r\nPerry, former Governor and U.S. Senator Charles S. Robb, former\r\nCongressman and White House chief of staff Leon E. Panetta, and Vernon\r\nE. Jordan, Jr., advisor to President Bill Clinton. Republicans\r\nincluded former Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court Sandra Day\r\nO'Connor, former U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson, former Attorney General\r\nEdwin Meese III, and former Secretary of State Lawrence S.\r\nEagleburger. Former CIA Director Robert Gates was an active member for\r\na period of months until his nomination as Secretary of Defense.\r\n\r\nThe Iraq Study Group was launched on March 15, 2006, in a Capitol Hill\r\nmeeting hosted by U.S. Senator John Warner and attended by\r\ncongressional leaders from both sides of the aisle.\r\n\r\nTo support the Study Group, the sponsoring organizations created four\r\nexpert working groups consisting of 44 leading foreign policy analysts\r\nand specialists on Iraq. The working groups, led by staff of the\r\nUnited States Institute of Peace, focused on the Strategic\r\nEnvironment, Military and Security Issues, Political Development, and\r\nthe Economy and Reconstruction. Every effort was made to ensure the\r\nparticipation of experts across a wide span of the political spectrum.\r\nAdditionally, a panel of retired military officers was consulted.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful to all those who have assisted the Study Group,\r\nespecially the supporting experts and staff. Our thanks go to Daniel\r\nP. Serwer of the Institute of Peace, who served as executive director;\r\nChristopher Kojm, advisor to the Study Group; John Williams, Policy\r\nAssistant to Mr. Baker; and Ben Rhodes, Special Assistant to Mr.\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\n  Richard H.
