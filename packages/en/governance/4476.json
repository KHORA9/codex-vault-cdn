ACROSS LONDON BRIDGE\r\n\r\nA gentleman, noteworthy for a lively countenance and a waistcoat to\r\nmatch it, crossing London Bridge at noon on a gusty April day, was\r\nalmost magically detached from his conflict with the gale by some sly\r\nstrip of slipperiness, abounding in that conduit of the markets, which\r\nhad more or less adroitly performed the trick upon preceding passengers,\r\nand now laid this one flat amid the shuffle of feet, peaceful for the\r\nmoment as the uncomplaining who have gone to Sabrina beneath the tides.\r\nHe was unhurt, quite sound, merely astonished, he remarked, in reply to\r\nthe inquiries of the first kind helper at his elbow; and it appeared an\r\nacceptable statement of his condition. He laughed, shook his coat-tails,\r\nsmoothed the back of his head rather thoughtfully, thankfully received\r\nhis runaway hat, nodded bright beams to right and left, and making light\r\nof the muddy stigmas imprinted by the pavement, he scattered another\r\nshower of his nods and smiles around, to signify, that as his good\r\nfriends would wish, he thoroughly felt his legs and could walk unaided.\r\nAnd he was in the act of doing it, questioning his familiar behind\r\nthe waistcoat amazedly, to tell him how such a misadventure could have\r\noccurred to him of all men, when a glance below his chin discomposed his\r\noutward face. ‘Oh, confound the fellow!’ he said, with simple frankness,\r\nand was humorously ruffled, having seen absurd blots of smutty knuckles\r\ndistributed over the maiden waistcoat.\r\n\r\nHis outcry was no more than the confidential communication of a genial\r\nspirit with that distinctive article of his attire. At the same time,\r\nfor these friendly people about him to share the fun of the annoyance,\r\nhe looked hastily brightly back, seeming with the contraction of his\r\nbrows to frown, on the little band of observant Samaritans; in the\r\ncentre of whom a man who knew himself honourably unclean, perhaps\r\nconsequently a bit of a political jewel, hearing one of their number\r\nconfounded for his pains, and by the wearer of a superfine dashing-white\r\nwaistcoat, was moved to take notice of the total deficiency of gratitude\r\nin this kind of gentleman’s look and pocket. If we ask for nothing for\r\nhelping gentlemen to stand upright on their legs, and get it, we expect\r\ncivility into the bargain. Moreover, there are reasons in nature why we\r\nchoose to give sign of a particular surliness when our wealthy superiors\r\nwould have us think their condescending grins are cordials.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman’s eyes were followed on a second hurried downward grimace,\r\nthe necessitated wrinkles of which could be stretched by malevolence to\r\na semblance of haughty disgust; reminding us, through our readings in\r\njournals, of the wicked overblown Prince Regent and his Court, together\r\nwith the view taken of honest labour in the mind of supercilious\r\nluxury, even if indebted to it freshly for a trifle; and the hoar-headed\r\nnineteenth-century billow of democratic ire craved the word to be set\r\nswelling.\r\n\r\n‘Am I the fellow you mean, sir?’ the man said.\r\n\r\nHe was answered, not ungraciously: ‘All right, my man.’\r\n\r\nBut the balance of our public equanimity is prone to violent antic\r\nbobbings on occasions when, for example, an ostentatious garment shall\r\nappear disdainful our class and ourself, and coin of the realm has not\r\nusurped command of one of the scales: thus a fairly pleasant answer,\r\ncast in persuasive features, provoked the retort:\r\n\r\n‘There you’re wrong; nor wouldn’t be.’\r\n\r\n‘What’s that?’ was the gentleman’s musical inquiry.\r\n\r\n‘That’s flat, as you was half a minute ago,’ the man rejoined.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, well, don’t be impudent,’ the gentleman said, by way of amiable\r\nremonstrance before a parting.\r\n\r\n‘And none of your dam punctilio,’ said the man.\r\n\r\nTheir exchange rattled smartly, without a direct hostility, and the\r\ngentleman stepped forward.\r\n\r\nIt was observed in the crowd, that after a few paces he put two fingers\r\non the back of his head.\r\n\r\nThey might suppose him to be condoling with his recent mishap. But,\r\nin fact, a thing had occurred to vex him more than a descent upon the\r\npavement or damage to his waistcoat’s whiteness: he abominated the\r\nthought of an altercation with a member of the mob; he found that\r\nenormous beat comprehensible only when it applauded him; and besides\r\nhe wished it warmly well; all that was good for it; plentiful dinners,\r\ncountry excursions, stout menagerie bars, music, a dance, and to bed: he\r\nwas for patting, stroking, petting the mob, for tossing it sops, never\r\nfor irritating it to show an eye-tooth, much less for causing it to\r\nexhibit the grinders: and in endeavouring to get at the grounds of his\r\ndissension with that dirty-fisted fellow, the recollection of the word\r\npunctilio shot a throb of pain to the spot where his mishap had rendered\r\nhim susceptible. Headache threatened--and to him of all men! But was\r\nthere ever such a word for drumming on a cranium? Puzzles are presented\r\nto us now and then in the course of our days; and the smaller they\r\nare the better for the purpose, it would seem; and they come in\r\nrattle-boxes, they are actually children’s toys, for what they contain,\r\nbut not the less do they buzz at our understandings and insist that they\r\nbreak or we, and, in either case, to show a mere foolish idle rattle in\r\nhollowness. Or does this happen to us only after a fall?\r\n\r\nHe tried a suspension of his mental efforts, and the word was like the\r\nclapper of a disorderly bell, striking through him, with reverberations,\r\nin the form of interrogations, as to how he, of all men living, could by\r\nany chance have got into a wrangle, in a thoroughfare, on London\r\nBridge, of all places in the world!--he, so popular, renowned for his\r\naffability, his amiability; having no dislike to common dirty dogs,\r\nentirely the reverse, liking them and doing his best for them; and\r\naccustomed to receive their applause. And in what way had he offered a\r\nhint to bring on him the charge of punctilio?\r\n\r\n‘But I am treating it seriously!’ he said, and jerked a dead laugh while\r\nfixing a button of his coat.\r\n\r\nThat he should have treated it seriously, furnished next the subject of\r\ncogitation; and here it was plainly suggested, that a degradation of\r\nhis physical system, owing to the shock of the fall, must be seen and\r\nacknowledged; for it had become a perverted engine, to pull him down\r\namong the puerilities, and very soon he was worrying at punctilio anew,\r\nattempting to read the riddle of the application of it to himself, angry\r\nthat he had allowed it to be the final word, and admitting it a famous\r\nword for the closing of a controversy:--it banged the door and rolled\r\ndrum-notes; it deafened reason. And was it a London cockney crow-word of\r\nthe day, or a word that had stuck in the fellow’s head from the perusal\r\nof his pothouse newspaper columns?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the plea of a fall, and the plea of a shock from a fall,\r\nrequired to account for the triviality of the mind, were humiliating to\r\nhim who had never hitherto missed a step, or owned to the shortest of\r\ncollapses. This confession of deficiency in explosive repartee--using\r\na friend’s term for the ready gift--was an old and a rueful one with\r\nVictor Radnor. His godmother Fortune denied him that. She bestowed it\r\non his friend Fenellan, and little else. Simeon Fenellan could clap the\r\nhalter on a coltish mob; he had positively caught the roar of cries and\r\nstilled it, by capping the cries in turn, until the people cheered him;\r\nand the effect of the scene upon Victor Radnor disposed him to rank the\r\ngift of repartee higher than a certain rosily oratorical that he was\r\npermitted to tell himself he possessed, in bottle if not on draught. Let\r\nit only be explosive repartee: the well-fused bomb, the bubble to\r\nthe stone, echo round the horn. Fenellan, would have discharged an\r\nextinguisher on punctilio in emission. Victor Radnor was unable to cope\r\nwith it reflectively.\r\n\r\nNo, but one doesn’t like being beaten by anything! he replied to an\r\nadmonishment of his better mind, as he touched his two fingers, more\r\nsignificantly dubious than the whole hand, at the back of his head,\r\nand checked or stemmed the current of a fear. For he was utterly unlike\r\nhimself; he was dwelling on a trifle, on a matter discernibly the\r\nsmallest, an incident of the streets; and although he refused to feel a\r\nbump or any responsive notification of a bruise, he made a sacrifice of\r\nhis native pride to his intellectual, in granting that he must have been\r\nshaken, so childishly did he continue thinking.\r\n\r\nYes, well, and if a tumble distorts our ideas of life, and an odd word\r\nengrosses our speculations, we are poor creatures, he addressed another\r\nfriend, from whom he stood constitutionally in dissent naming him\r\nColney; and under pressure of the name, reviving old wrangles between\r\nthem upon man’s present achievements and his probable destinies:\r\nespecially upon England’s grandeur, vitality, stability, her intelligent\r\nappreciation of her place in the universe; not to speak of the historic\r\ndignity of London City. Colney had to be overcome afresh, and he\r\nfled, but managed, with two or three of his bitter phrases, to make a\r\ncuttle-fish fight of it, that oppressively shadowed his vanquisher:\r\n\r\nThe Daniel Lambert of Cities: the Female Annuitant of Nations:--and such\r\nlike, wretched stuff, proper to Colney Durance, easily dispersed and\r\nout-laughed when we have our vigour. We have as much as we need of it\r\nin summoning a contemptuous Pooh to our lips, with a shrug at venomous\r\ndyspepsia.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a malignant sketch of Colney’s, in the which Hengist\r\nand Horsa, our fishy Saxon originals, in modern garb of liveryman and\r\ngaitered squire, flat-headed, paunchy, assiduously servile, are shown\r\nblacking Ben-Israel’s boots and grooming the princely stud of the Jew,\r\nhad come so near to Victor Radnor’s apprehensions of a possible, if not\r\nan impending, consummation, that the ghastly vision of the Jew Dominant\r\nin London City, over England, over Europe, America, the world (a picture\r\ndrawn in literary sepia by Colney: with our poor hang neck population\r\nuncertain about making a bell-rope of the forelock to the Satyr-snouty\r\nmaster; and the Norman Lord de Warenne handing him for a lump sum son\r\nand daughter, both to be Hebraized in their different ways), fastened on\r\nthe most mercurial of patriotic men, and gave him a whole-length plunge\r\ninto despondency.\r\n\r\nIt lasted nearly a minute. His recovery was not in this instance due\r\nto the calling on himself for the rescue of an ancient and glorious\r\ncountry; nor altogether to the spectacle of the shipping, over the\r\nparapet, to his right: the hundreds of masts rising out of the merchant\r\nriver; London’s unrivalled mezzotint and the City’ rhetorician’s\r\ninexhaustible argument: he gained it rather from the imperious demand of\r\nan animated and thirsty frame for novel impressions. Commonly he was\r\ntoo hot with his business, and airy fancies above it when crossing the\r\nbridge, to reflect in freshness on its wonders; though a phrase could\r\nspring him alive to them; a suggestion of the Foreigner, jealous,\r\ncondemned to admire in despair of outstripping, like Satan worsted;\r\nor when a Premier’s fine inflation magnified the scene at City\r\nbanquets--exciting while audible, if a waggery in memory; or when\r\nEngland’s cherished Bard, the Leading Article, blew bellows, and wind\r\nprimed the lieges.\r\n\r\nThat a phrase on any other subject was of much the same effect, in\r\nrelation to it, may be owned; he was lightly kindled. The scene,\r\nhowever, had a sharp sparkle of attractiveness at the instant. Down went\r\nthe twirling horizontal pillars of a strong tide from the arches of the\r\nbridge, breaking to wild water at a remove; and a reddish Northern cheek\r\nof curdling pipeing East, at shrilly puffs between the Tower and\r\nthe Custom House, encountered it to whip and ridge the flood against\r\ndescending tug and long tail of stern-ajerk empty barges; with a steamer\r\nslowly noseing round off the wharf-cranes, preparing to swirl the screw;\r\nand half-bottom-upward boats dancing harpooner beside their whale; along\r\nan avenue, not fabulously golden, of the deputy masts of all nations, a\r\nwintry woodland, every rag aloft curling to volume; and here the spouts\r\nand the mounds of steam, and rolls of brown smoke there, variously\r\nundulated, curved to vanish; cold blue sky ashift with the whirl and\r\ndash of a very Tartar cavalry of cloud overhead.\r\n\r\nSurely a scene pretending to sublimity?\r\n\r\nGazeing along that grand highway of the voyageing forest, your London\r\ncitizen of good estate has reproached his country’s poets for not\r\npouring out, succinctly and melodiously, his multitudinous larvae of\r\nnotions begotten by the scene. For there are times when he would, pay\r\nto have them sung; and he feels them big; he thinks them human in their\r\nbulk; they are Londinensian; they want but form and fire to get them\r\nscored on the tablets of the quotable at festive boards. This he can\r\npromise to his poets. As for otherwhere than at the festive, Commerce\r\ninvoked is a Goddess that will have the reek of those boards to fill her\r\nnostrils, and poet and alderman alike may be dedicate to the sublime,\r\nshe leads them, after two sniffs of an idea concerning her, for the dive\r\ninto the turtle-tureen. Heels up they go, poet first--a plummet he!\r\n\r\nAnd besides it is barely possible for our rounded citizen, in the mood\r\nof meditation, to direct his gaze off the bridge along the waterway\r\nNorth-eastward without beholding as an eye the glow of whitebait’s\r\nbow-window by the riverside, to the front of the summer sunset, a league\r\nor so down stream; where he sees, in memory savours, the Elysian end of\r\nCommerce: frontispiece of a tale to fetch us up the out-wearied spectre\r\nof old Apicius; yea, and urge Crispinus to wheel his purse into the\r\nmarket for the purchase of a costlier mullet!\r\n\r\nBut is the Jew of the usury gold becoming our despot-king of Commerce?\r\n\r\nIn that case, we do not ask our country’s poets to compose a single\r\nstanza of eulogy’s rhymes--far from it. Far to the contrary, we bid\r\nourselves remember the sons of whom we are; instead of revelling in\r\nthe fruits of Commerce, we shoot scornfully past those blazing bellied\r\nwindows of the aromatic dinners, and beyond Thames, away to the\r\nfishermen’s deeps, Old England’s native element, where the strenuous\r\nancestry of a race yet and ever manful at the stress of trial are heard\r\naround and aloft whistling us back to the splendid strain of muscle,\r\nand spray fringes cloud, and strong heart rides the briny scoops and\r\nhillocks, and Death and Man are at grip for the haul.\r\n\r\nThere we find our nationality, our poetry, no Hebrew competing.\r\n\r\nWe do: or there at least we left it. Whether to recover it when wanted,\r\nis not so certain. Humpy Hengist and dumpy Horsa, quitting ledger and\r\ncoronet, might recur to their sea bowlegs and red-stubble chins, might\r\ntake to their tarpaulins again; they might renew their manhood on the\r\ncapture of cod; headed by Harald and Hardiknut, they might roll surges\r\nto whelm a Dominant Jew clean gone to the fleshpots and effeminacy.\r\nAldermen of our ancient conception, they may teach him that he has been\r\nbacksliding once more, and must repent in ashes, as those who are for\r\njewels, titles, essences, banquets, for wallowing in slimy spawn of\r\nlucre, have ever to do. They dispossess him of his greedy gettings.\r\n\r\nAnd how of the Law?\r\n\r\nBut the Law is always, and must ever be, the Law of the stronger.\r\n--Ay, but brain beats muscle, and what if the Jew should prove to have\r\nsuperior power of brain? A dreaded hypothesis! Why, then you see the\r\ninsurgent Saxon seamen (of the names in two syllables with accent on\r\nthe first), and their Danish captains, and it may be but a remnant of\r\nhigh-nosed old Norman Lord de Warenne beside them, in the criminal box:\r\nand presently the Jew smoking a giant regalia cigar on a balcony giving\r\nview of a gallows-tree. But we will try that: on our side, to back a\r\nnative pugnacity, is morality, humanity, fraternity--nature’s rights,\r\naha! and who withstands them? on his, a troop of mercenaries!\r\n\r\nAnd that lands me in Red Republicanism, a hop and a skip from Socialism!\r\nsaid Mr. Radnor, and chuckled ironically at the natural declivity he had\r\ncome to. Still, there was an idea in it....\r\n\r\nA short run or attempt at running after the idea, ended in pain to\r\nhis head near the spot where the haunting word punctilio caught at any\r\nexcuse for clamouring.\r\n\r\nYet we cannot relinquish an idea that was ours; we are vowed to the\r\npursuit of it. Mr. Radnor lighted on the tracks, by dint of a thought\r\nflung at his partner Mr. Inchling’s dread of the Jews. Inchling dreaded\r\nScotchmen as well, and Americans, and Armenians, and Greeks: latterly\r\nGermans hardly less; but his dread of absorption in Jewry, signifying\r\nsubjection, had often precipitated a deplorable shrug, in which Victor\r\nRadnor now perceived the skirts of his idea, even to a fancy that\r\nsomething of the idea must have struck Inchling when he shrugged:\r\nthe idea being... he had lost it again. Definition seemed to be an\r\nextirpation enemy of this idea, or she was by nature shy. She was very\r\nfeminine; coming when she willed and flying when wanted. Not until\r\nnigh upon the close of his history did she return, full-statured and\r\nembraceable, to Victor Radnor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THROUGH THE VAGUE TO THE INFINITELY LITTLE\r\n\r\nThe fair dealing with readers demands of us, that a narrative shall not\r\nproceed at slower pace than legs of a man in motion; and we are still\r\nbut little more than midway across London Bridge. But if a man’s mind is\r\nto be taken as a part of him, the likening of it, at an introduction, to\r\nan army on the opening march of a great campaign, should plead excuses\r\nfor tardy forward movements, in consideration of the large amount of\r\nmatter you have to review before you can at all imagine yourselves to\r\nhave made his acquaintance. This it is not necessary to do when you are\r\nset astride the enchanted horse of the Tale, which leaves the man’s\r\nmind at home while he performs the deeds befitting him: he can indeed be\r\nrapid. Whether more active, is a question asking for your notions of the\r\ngoverning element in the composition of man, and of hid present business\r\nhere. The Tale inspirits one’s earlier ardours, when we sped without\r\nbaggage, when the Impossible was wings to imagination, and heroic\r\nsculpture the simplest act of the chisel. It does not advance, ‘tis\r\ntrue; it drives the whirligig circle round and round the single existing\r\ncentral point; but it is enriched with applause of the boys and girls of\r\nboth ages in this land; and all the English critics heap their\r\nhonours on its brave old Simplicity: our national literary flag, which\r\nsignalizes us while we float, subsequently to flap above the shallows.\r\nOne may sigh for it. An ill-fortuned minstrel who has by fateful\r\ndirection been brought to see with distinctness, that man is not as much\r\ncomprised in external features as the monkey, will be devoted to the\r\ntask of the fuller portraiture.\r\n\r\nAfter his ineffectual catching at the volatile idea, Mr. Radnor found\r\nrepose in thoughts of his daughter and her dear mother. They had begged\r\nhim to put on an overcoat this day of bitter wind, or a silken kerchief\r\nfor the throat. Faithful to the Spring, it had been his habit since\r\nboyhood to show upon his person something of the hue of the vernal\r\nmonth, the white of the daisied meadow, and although he owned a light\r\novercoat to dangle from shoulders at the Opera crush, he declined to\r\nwear it for protection. His gesture of shaking and expanding whenever\r\nthe tender request was urged on him, signified a physical opposition to\r\nthe control of garments. Mechanically now, while doating in fancy over\r\nthe couple beseeching him, he loosened the button across his defaced\r\nwaistcoat, exposed a large measure of chest to flaws of a wind barbed on\r\nNorwegian peaks by the brewers of cough and catarrh--horrid women of the\r\nwhistling clouts, in the pay of our doctors. He braved them; he starved\r\nthe profession. He was that man in fifty thousand who despises hostile\r\nelements and goes unpunished, calmly erect among a sneezing and tumbled\r\nhost, as a lighthouse overhead of breezy fleets. The coursing of his\r\nblood was by comparison electrical; he had not the sensation of cold,\r\nother than that of an effort of the elements to arouse him; and so quick\r\nwas he, through this fine animation, to feel, think, act, that the three\r\nsuccessive tributaries of conduct appeared as an irreflective flash and\r\na gamester’s daring in the vein to men who had no deep knowledge of him\r\nand his lightning arithmetic for measuring, sounding, and deciding.\r\n\r\nNaturally he was among the happiest of human creatures; he willed it so,\r\nwith consent of circumstances; a boisterous consent, as when votes are\r\nreckoned for a favourite candidate: excepting on the part of a small\r\nband of black dissentients in a corner, a minute opaque body, devilish\r\nin their irreconcilability, who maintain their struggle to provoke\r\ndiscord, with a cry disclosing the one error of his youth, the sole bad\r\nstep chargeable upon his antecedents. But do we listen to them? Shall\r\nwe not have them turned out? He gives the sign for it; and he leaves his\r\nbuoying constituents to outroar them: and he tells a friend that it\r\nwas not, as one may say, an error, although an erratic step: but let us\r\nexplain to our bosom friend; it was a step quite unregretted, gloried\r\nin; a step deliberately marked, to be done again, were the time renewed:\r\nit was a step necessitated (emphatically) by a false preceding step;\r\nand having youth to plead for it, in the first instance, youth and\r\nignorance; and secondly, and O how deeply truly! Love. Deep true love,\r\nproved by years, is the advocate.\r\n\r\nHe tells himself at the same time, after lending ear to the advocate’s\r\nexordium and a favourite sentence, that, judged by the Powers (to them\r\nonly can he expose the whole skeleton-cupboard of the case), judged by\r\nthose clear-sighted Powers, he is exonerated.\r\n\r\nTo be exonerated by those awful Powers, is to be approved.\r\n\r\nAs to that, there is no doubt: whom they, all-seeing, discerning as they\r\ndo, acquit they justify.\r\n\r\nWhom they justify, they compliment.\r\n\r\nThey, seeing all the facts, are not unintelligent of distinctions, as\r\nthe world is.\r\n\r\nWhat, to them, is the spot of the error?--admitting it as an error.\r\nThey know it for a thing of convention, not of Nature. We stand forth to\r\nplead it in proof of an adherence to Nature’s laws: we affirm, that far\r\nfrom a defilement, it is an illumination and stamp of nobility. On the\r\nbeloved who shares it with us, it is a stamp of the highest nobility.\r\nOur world has many ways for signifying its displeasure, but it cannot\r\nbrand an angel.\r\n\r\nThis was another favourite sentence of Love’s grand oration for the\r\ndefence. So seductive was it to the Powers who sat in judgement on the\r\ncase, that they all, when the sentence came, turned eyes upon the angel,\r\nand they smiled.\r\n\r\nThey do not smile on the condemnable.\r\n\r\nShe, then, were he rebuked, would have strength to uplift him. And who,\r\ncalling her his own, could be placed in second rank among the blissful!\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor could rationally say that he was made for happiness; he\r\nflew to it, he breathed, dispensed it. How conceive the clear-sighted\r\ncelestial Powers as opposing his claim to that estate? Not they. He\r\nknew, for he had them safe in the locked chamber of his breast, to yield\r\nhim subservient responses. The world, or Puritanic members of it, had\r\npushed him to the trial once or twice--or had put on an air of doing\r\nso; creating a temporary disturbance, ending in a merry duet with his\r\ndaughter Nesta Victoria: a glorious trio when her mother Natalia, sweet\r\nlily that she was, shook the rainwater from her cup and followed the\r\ngood example to shine in the sun.\r\n\r\nHe had a secret for them.\r\n\r\nNesta’s promising soprano, and her mother’s contralto, and his\r\nbaritone--a true baritone, not so well trained as their accurate\r\nnotes--should be rising in spirited union with the curtain of that\r\nsecret: there was matter for song and concert, triumph and gratulation\r\nin it. And during the whole passage of the bridge, he had not once\r\ncast thought on a secret so palpitating, the cause of the morning’s\r\nexpedition and a long year’s prospect of the present day! It seemed to\r\nhave been knocked clean out of it--punctilioed out, Fenellan might say.\r\nNor had any combinations upon the theme of business displaced it. Just\r\nbefore the fall, the whole drama of the unfolding of that secret was\r\nbrilliant to his eyes as a scene on a stage.\r\n\r\nHe refused to feel any sensible bruise on his head, with the admission\r\nthat he perhaps might think he felt one which was virtually no more than\r\nthe feeling of a thought;--what his friend Dr. Peter Yatt would define\r\nas feeling a rotifer astir in the curative compartment of a homoeopathic\r\nglobule: and a playful fancy may do that or anything. Only, Sanity does\r\nnot allow the infinitely little to disturb us.\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor had a quaint experience of the effects of the infinitely\r\nlittle while threading his way to a haberdasher’s shop for new white\r\nwaistcoats. Under the shadow of the representative statue of City\r\nCorporations and London’s majesty, the figure of Royalty, worshipful in\r\nits marbled redundancy, fronting the bridge, on the slope where the seas\r\nof fish and fruit below throw up a thin line of their drift, he\r\nstood contemplating the not unamiable, reposefully-jolly, Guelphic\r\ncountenance, from the loose jowl to the bent knee, as if it were a\r\nnovelty to him; unwilling to trust himself to the roadway he had often\r\ntraversed, equally careful that his hesitation should not be seen. A\r\ntrifle more impressible, he might have imagined the smoky figure and\r\nmagnum of pursiness barring the City against him. He could have laughed\r\naloud at the hypocrisy behind his quiet look of provincial wonderment\r\nat London’s sculptor’s art; and he was partly tickled as well by the\r\nsingular fit of timidity enchaining him. Cart, omnibus, cab, van,\r\nbarrow, donkey-tray, went by in strings, broken here and there, and he\r\ncould not induce his legs to take advantage of the gaps; he listened\r\nto a warning that he would be down again if he tried it, among those\r\nwheels; and his nerves clutched him, like a troop of household women, to\r\nkeep him from the hazard of an exposure to the horrid crunch, pitiless\r\nas tiger’s teeth; and we may say truly, that once down, or once out of\r\nthe rutted line, you are food for lion and jackal--the forces of the\r\nworld will have you in their mandibles.\r\n\r\nAn idea was there too; but it would not accept pursuit.\r\n\r\n‘A pretty scud overheard?’ said a voice at his ear.\r\n\r\n‘For fine!--to-day at least,’ Mr. Radnor affably replied to a stranger;\r\nand gazing on the face of his friend Fenellan, knew the voice, and\r\nlaughed: ‘You?’ He straightened his back immediately to cross the road,\r\ndismissing nervousness as a vapour, asking, between a cab and a van:\r\n‘Anything doing in the City?’ For Mr. Fenellan’s proper station faced\r\nWestward.\r\n\r\nThe reply was deferred until they had reached the pavement, when Mr.\r\nFenellan said: ‘I’ll tell you,’ and looked a dubious preface, to his\r\nfriend’s thinking.\r\n\r\nBut it was merely the mental inquiry following a glance at mud-spots on\r\nthe coat.\r\n\r\n‘We’ll lunch; lunch with me, I must eat, tell me then,’ said Mr. Radnor,\r\nadding within himself: ‘Emptiness! want of food!’ to account for recent\r\nejaculations and qualms. He had not eaten for a good four hours.\r\n\r\nFenellan’s tone signified to his feverish sensibility of the moment,\r\nthat the matter was personal; and the intimation of a touch on domestic\r\naffairs caused sinkings in his vacuity, much as though his heart were\r\nhaving a fall.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned the slip on the bridge, to explain his: need to visit a\r\nhaberdasher’s shop, and pointed at the waistcoat.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan was compassionate over the ‘Poor virgin of the smoky city!’\r\n\r\n‘They have their ready-made at these shops--last year’s: perhaps, never\r\nmind, do for the day,’ said Mr. Radnor, impatient for eating, now that\r\nhe had spoken of it. ‘A basin of turtle; I can’t wait. A brush of the\r\ncoat; mud must be dry by this time. Clear turtle, I think, with a bottle\r\nof the Old Veuve. Not bad news to tell? You like that Old Veuve?’\r\n\r\n‘Too well to tell bad news of her,’ said Mr. Fenellan in a manner to\r\nreassure his friend, as he intended. ‘You wouldn’t credit it for the\r\nSpring of the year, without the spotless waistcoat?’\r\n\r\n‘Something of that, I suppose.’ And so saying, Mr. Radnor entered the\r\nshop of his quest, to be complimented by the shopkeeper, while the\r\nattendants climbed the ladder to upper stages for white-waistcoat boxes,\r\non his being; the first bird of the season; which it pleased him to\r\nhear; for the smallest of our gratifications in life could give a happy\r\ntone to this brightly-constituted gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. OLD VEUVE\r\n\r\nThey were known at the house of the turtle and the attractive Old\r\nVeuve: a champagne of a sobered sweetness, of a great year, a great age,\r\ncounting up to the extremer maturity attained by wines of stilly depths;\r\nand their worthy comrade, despite the wanton sparkles, for the promoting\r\nof the state of reverential wonderment in rapture, which an ancient wine\r\nwill lead to, well you wot. The silly girly sugary crudity his given\r\nway to womanly suavity, matronly composure, with yet the sparkles; they\r\nascend; but hue and flavour tell of a soul that has come to a lodgement\r\nthere. It conducts the youthful man to temples of dusky thought:\r\nphilosophers partaking of it are drawn by the arms of garlanded nymphs\r\nabout their necks into the fathomless of inquiries. It presents us with\r\na sphere, for the pursuit of the thing we covet most. It bubbles over\r\nmellowness; it has, in the marriage with Time, extracted a spice of\r\nindividuality from the saccharine: by miracle, one would say, were it\r\nnot for our knowledge of the right noble issue of Time when he and\r\ngood things unite. There should be somewhere legends of him and the\r\nwine-flask. There must be meanings to that effect in the Mythology,\r\nawaiting unravelment. For the subject opens to deeper than cellars, and\r\nis a tree with vast ramifications of the roots and the spreading growth,\r\nwhereon half if not all the mythic Gods, Inferior and Superior, Infernal\r\nand Celestial, might be shown sitting in concord, performing in concert,\r\nharmoniously receiving sacrificial offerings of the black or the\r\nwhite; and the black not extinguishing the fairer fellow. Tell us of a\r\ncertainty that Time has embraced the wine-flask, then may it be asserted\r\n(assuming the great year for the wine, i.e. combinations above) that\r\na speck of the white within us who drink will conquer, to rise in main\r\nascension over volumes of the black. It may, at a greater venture, but\r\nconfidently, be said in plain speech, that the Bacchus of auspicious\r\nbirth induces ever to the worship of the loftier Deities.\r\n\r\nThink as you will; forbear to come hauling up examples of malarious men,\r\nin whom these pourings of the golden rays of life breed fogs; and be\r\nmoved, since you are scarcely under an obligation to hunt the meaning,\r\nin tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety of narration (quiverings of\r\nthe reverent pen) when we find ourselves entering the circle of a\r\nmost magnetic polarity. Take it for not worse than accompanying choric\r\nflourishes, in accord with Mr. Victor Radnor and Mr. Simeon Fenellan at\r\ntheir sipping of the venerable wine.\r\n\r\nSeated in a cosy corner, near the grey City window edged with a sooty\r\nmaze, they praised the wine, in the neuter and in the feminine; that for\r\nthe glass, this for the widow-branded bottle: not as poets hymning;\r\nit was done in the City manner, briefly, part pensively, like men\r\ntravelling to the utmost bourne of flying flavour (a dell in infinite\r\nnether), and still masters of themselves and at home.\r\n\r\nSuch a wine, in its capturing permeation of us, insists on being for a\r\ntime a theme.\r\n\r\n‘I wonder!’ said Mr. Radnor, completely restored, eyeing his\r\nhalf-emptied second glass and his boon-fellow.\r\n\r\n‘Low!’ Mr. Fenellan shook his head.\r\n\r\n‘Half a dozen dozen left?’\r\n\r\n‘Nearer the half of that. And who’s the culprit?’\r\n\r\n‘Old days! They won’t let me have another dozen out of the house now.’\r\n\r\n‘They’ll never hit on such another discovery in their cellar, unless\r\nthey unearth a fifth corner.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t blame them for making the price prohibitive. And sound as\r\never!’\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor watched the deliberate constant ascent of bubbles through\r\ntheir rose-topaz transparency. He drank. That notion of the dish of\r\nturtle was an inspiration of the right: he ought always to know it for\r\nthe want of replenishment when such a man as he went quaking. His latest\r\nexperiences of himself were incredible; but they passed, as the dimples\r\nof the stream. He finished his third glass. The bottle, like the\r\ncellar-wine, was at ebb: unlike the cellar-wine, it could be set flowing\r\nagain: He prattled, in the happy ignorance of compulsion:\r\n\r\n‘Fenellan, remember, I had a sort of right to the wine--to the best I\r\ncould get; and this Old Veuve, more than any other, is a bridal wine! We\r\nheard of Giulia Sanfredini’s marriage to come off with the Spanish Duke,\r\nand drank it to the toast of our little Nesta’s godmother. I ‘ve told\r\nyou. We took the girl to the Opera, when quite a little one--that\r\nhigh:--and I declare to you, it was marvellous! Next morning after\r\nbreakfast, she plants herself in the middle of the room, and strikes\r\nher attitude for song, and positively, almost with the Sanfredini’s\r\nvoice--illusion of it, you know,--trills us out more than I could have\r\nbelieved credible to be recollected by a child. But I’ve told you the\r\nstory. We called her Fredi from that day. I sent the diva, with\r\nexcuses and compliments, a nuptial present-necklace, Roman goldwork,\r\nlocket-pendant, containing sunny curl, and below a fine pearl; really\r\npretty; telling her our grounds for the liberty. She replied, accepting\r\nthe responsible office; touching letter--we found it so; framed in\r\nFredi’s room, under her godmother’s photograph. Fredi has another\r\nheroine now, though she worships her old one still; she never abandons\r\nher old ones. You’ve heard the story over and over!’\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan nodded; he had a tenderness for the garrulity of Old Veuve,\r\nand for the damsel. Chatter on that subject ran pleasantly with their\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor meanwhile scribbled, and despatched a strip of his Note-book,\r\nbearing a scrawl of orders, to his office. He was now fully himself,\r\nbenevolent, combative, gay, alert for amusement or the probeing of\r\nschemes to the quick, weighing the good and the bad in them with his\r\nfine touch on proportion.\r\n\r\n‘City dead flat? A monotonous key; but it’s about the same as fetching a\r\nbreath after a run; only, true, it lasts too long--not healthy! Skepsey\r\nwill bring me my letters. I was down in the country early this morning,\r\nlooking over the house, with Taplow, my architect; and he speaks fairly\r\nwell of the contractors. Yes, down at Lakelands; and saw my first lemon\r\nbutterfly in a dell of sunshine, out of the wind, and had half a mind\r\nto catch it for Fredi,--and should have caught it myself, if I had! The\r\ntruth is, we three are country born and bred; we pine in London. Good\r\nfor a season; you know my old feeling. They are to learn the secret of\r\nLakelands to-morrow. It ‘s great fun; they think I don’t see they’ve had\r\ntheir suspicion for some time. You said--somebody said--“the eye of a\r\nneedle for what they let slip of their secrets, and the point of it\r\nfor penetrating yours”:--women. But no; my dear souls didn’t prick\r\nand bother. And they dealt with a man in armour. I carry them down to\r\nLakelands to-morrow, if the City’s flat.’\r\n\r\n‘Keeping a secret’s the lid on a boiling pot with you,’ Mr. Fenellan\r\nsaid; and he mused on the profoundness of the flavour at his lips.\r\n\r\n‘I do it.’\r\n\r\n‘You do: up to bursting at the breast.’\r\n\r\n‘I keep it from Colney!’\r\n\r\n‘As Vesuvius keeps it from Palmieri when shaking him.’\r\n\r\n‘Has old Colney an idea of it?’\r\n\r\n‘He has been foretelling an eruption of an edifice.’\r\n\r\nThe laugh between them subsided to pensiveness.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan’s delay in the delivery of his news was eloquent to reveal\r\nthe one hateful topic; and this being seen, it waxed to such increase of\r\nsize with the passing seconds, that prudence called for it.\r\n\r\n‘Come!’ said Mr. Radnor.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was understood.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing very particular. I came into the City to look at a warehouse\r\nthey want to mount double guard on. Your idea of the fireman’s\r\nnight-patrol and wires has done wonders for the office.’\r\n\r\n‘I guarantee the City if all my directions are followed.’\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan’s remark, that he had nothing very particular to tell,\r\nreduced it to the mere touch upon a vexatious matter, which one has\r\nto endure in the ears at times; but it may be postponed. So Mr. Radnor\r\nencouraged him to talk of an Insurance Office Investment. Where it is\r\nall bog and mist, as in the City to-day, the maxim is, not to take a\r\nstep, they agreed. Whether it was attributable to an unconsumed glut\r\nof the markets, or apprehension of a panic, had to be considered. Both\r\ngentlemen were angry with the Birds on the flags of foreign nations,\r\nwhich would not imitate a sawdust Lion to couch reposefully. Incessantly\r\nthey scream and sharpen talons.\r\n\r\n‘They crack the City bubbles and bladders, at all events,’ Mr. Fenellan\r\nsaid. ‘But if we let our journals go on making use of them, in the shape\r\nof sham hawks overhead, we shall pay for their one good day of the\r\ngame with our loss of the covey. An unstable London’s no world’s\r\nmarket-place.’\r\n\r\n‘No, no; it’s a niggardly national purse, not the journals,’ Mr. Radnor\r\nsaid. ‘The journals are trading engines. Panics are grist to them; so\r\nare wars; but they do their duty in warning the taxpayer and rousing\r\nParliament. Dr. Schlesien’s right: we go on believing that our God\r\nNeptune will do everything for us, and won’t see that Steam has\r\nparalyzed his Trident: good! You and Colney are hard on Schlesien--or\r\nat him, I should say. He’s right: if we won’t learn that we have become\r\nContinentals, we shall be marched over. Laziness, cowardice, he says.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, be hanged!’ interrupted Fenellan. ‘As much of the former as you\r\nlike. He ‘s right about our “individualismus” being another name for\r\nselfishness, and showing the usual deficiency in external features; it’s\r\nan individualism of all of a pattern, as when a mob cuts its lucky, each\r\nfellow his own way. Well, then, conscript them, and they’ll be all of a\r\nbetter pattern. The only thing to do, and the cheapest. By heaven! it’s\r\nthe only honourable thing to do.’\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor disapproved. ‘No conscription here.’\r\n\r\n‘Not till you’ve got the drop of poison in your blood, in the form of an\r\narmy landed. That will teach you to catch at the drug.’\r\n\r\n‘No, Fenellan! Besides they’ve got to land. I guarantee a trusty army\r\nand navy under a contract, at two-thirds of the present cost. We’ll\r\nstart a National Defence Insurance Company after the next panic.’\r\n\r\n‘During,’ said Mr. Fenellan, and there was a flutter of laughter at the\r\nunobtrusive hint for seizing Dame England in the mood.\r\n\r\nBoth dropped a sigh.\r\n\r\n‘But you must try and run down with us to Lakelands to-morrow,’ Mr.\r\nRadnor resumed on a cheerfuller theme. ‘You have not yet seen all I\r\n‘ve done there. And it ‘s a castle with a drawbridge: no exchangeing\r\nof visits, as we did at Craye Farm and at Creckholt; we are there for\r\ncountry air; we don’t court neighbours at all--perhaps the elect; it\r\nwill depend on Nataly’s wishes. We can accommodate our Concert-set, and\r\nabout thirty or forty more, for as long as they like. You see, that was\r\nmy intention--to be independent of neighbouring society. Madame Callet\r\nguarantees dinners or hot suppers for eighty--and Armandine is the last\r\nperson to be recklessly boasting.--When was it I was thinking last of\r\nArmandine?’ He asked himself that, as he rubbed at the back of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan was reading his friend’s character by the light of his\r\nremarks and in opposition to them, after the critical fashion of\r\nintimates who know as well as hear: but it was amiably and trippingly,\r\non the dance of the wine in his veins.\r\n\r\nHis look, however, was one that reminded; and Mr. Radnor cried: ‘Now!\r\nwhatever it is!’\r\n\r\n‘I had an interview: I assure you,’ Mr. Fenellan interposed to pacify:\r\n‘the smallest of trifles, and to be expected: I thought you ought to\r\nknow it:--an interview with her lawyer; office business, increase of\r\nInsurance on one of her City warehouses.’\r\n\r\n‘Speak her name, speak the woman’s name; we’re talking like a pair of\r\nconspirators,’ exclaimed Mr. Radnor.\r\n\r\n‘He informed me that Mrs. Burman has heard of the new mansion.’\r\n\r\n‘My place at Lakelands?’\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor’s clear-water eyes hardened to stony as their vision ran\r\nalong the consequences of her having heard it.\r\n\r\n‘Earlier this time!’ he added, thrummed on the table, and thumped with\r\nknuckles. ‘I make my stand at Lakelands for good! Nothing mortal moves\r\nme!’\r\n\r\n‘That butler of hers--’\r\n\r\n‘Jarniman, you mean: he’s her butler, yes, the scoundrel--h’m-pah!\r\nHeaven forgive me! she’s an honest woman at least; I wouldn’t rob her of\r\nher little: fifty-nine or sixty next September, fifteenth of the month!\r\nwith the constitution of a broken drug-bottle, poor soul! She hears\r\neverything from Jarniman: he catches wind of everything. All foreseen,\r\nFenellan, foreseen. I have made my stand at Lakelands, and there’s my\r\nflag till it’s hauled down over Victor Radnor. London kills Nataly as\r\nwell as Fredi--and me: that is--I can use the words to you--I get back\r\nto primal innocence in the country. We all three have the feeling.\r\nYou’re a man to understand. My beasts, and the wild flowers,\r\nhedge-banks, and stars. Fredi’s poetess will tell you. Quiet waters\r\nreflecting. I should feel it in Paris as well, though they have\r\nnightingales in their Bois. It’s the rustic I want to bathe me; and I\r\nhad the feeling at school, biting at Horace. Well, this is my Sabine\r\nFarm, rather on a larger scale, for the sake of friends. Come, and pure\r\nair, water from the springs, walks and rides in lanes, high sand-lanes;\r\nNataly loves them; Fredi worships the old roots of trees: she calls them\r\nthe faces of those weedy sandy lanes. And the two dear souls on their\r\nown estate, Fenellan! And their poultry, cows, cream. And a certain\r\ninfluence one has in the country socially. I make my stand on a\r\nhome--not empty punctilio.’\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan repeated, in a pause, ‘Punctilio,’ and not emphatically.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t bawl the word,’ said Mr. Radnor, at the drum of whose ears it\r\nrang and sang. ‘Here in the City the woman’s harmless; and here,’ he\r\nstruck his breast. ‘But she can shoot and hit another through me. Ah,\r\nthe witch!--poor wretch! poor soul! Only, she’s malignant. I could\r\nswear! But Colney ‘s right for once in something he says about\r\noaths--“dropping empty buckets,” or something.’\r\n\r\n‘“Empty buckets to haul up impotent demons, whom we have to pay as\r\nheavily as the ready devil himself,”’ Mr. Fenellan supplied the phrase.\r\n‘Only, the moment old Colney moralizes, he’s what the critics call\r\nsententious. We’ve all a parlous lot too much pulpit in us.’\r\n\r\n‘Come, Fenellan, I don’t think...’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, yes, but it’s true of me too.’\r\n\r\n‘You reserve it for your enemies.’\r\n\r\n‘I ‘d like to distract it a bit from the biggest of ‘em.’ He pointed\r\nfinger at the region of the heart.\r\n\r\n‘Here we have Skepsey,’ said Mr. Radnor, observing the rapid approach\r\nof a lean small figure, that in about the time of a straight-aimed\r\njavelin’s cast, shot from the doorway to the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE SECOND BOTTLE\r\n\r\nThis little dart of a man came to a stop at a respectful distance from\r\nhis master, having the look of an arrested needle in mechanism. His lean\r\nslip of face was an illumination of vivacious grey from the quickest\r\nof prominent large eyes. He placed his master’s letters legibly on the\r\ntable, and fell to his posture of attention, alert on stiff legs, the\r\nhands like sucking-cubs at play with one another.\r\n\r\nSkepsey waited for Mr. Fenellan to notice him.\r\n\r\n‘How about the Schools for Boxing?’ that gentleman said.\r\n\r\nDeploring in motion the announcement he had to make, Skepsey replied: ‘I\r\nhave a difficulty in getting the plan treated seriously: a person of no\r\nstation:--it does not appear of national importance. Ladies are against.\r\nThey decline their signatures; and ladies have great influence; because\r\nof the blood; which we know is very slight, rather healthy than not; and\r\nit could be proved for the advantage of the frailer sex. They seem to be\r\nunaware of their own interests--ladies. The contention all around us is\r\nwith ignorance. My plan is written; I have shown it, and signatures\r\nof gentlemen, to many of our City notables favourable in most cases:\r\ngentlemen of the Stock Exchange highly. The clergy and the medical\r\nprofession are quite with me.’\r\n\r\n‘The surgical, perhaps you mean?’\r\n\r\n‘Also, sir. The clergy strongly.’\r\n\r\n‘On the grounds of--what, Skepsey?’\r\n\r\n‘Morality. I have fully explained to them:--after his work at the desk\r\nall day, the young City clerk wants refreshment. He needs it, must\r\nhave it. I propose to catch him on his way to his music-halls and other\r\nplaces, and take him to one of our establishments. A short term of\r\ninstruction, and he would find a pleasure in the gloves; it would\r\ndelight him more than excesses-beer and tobacco. The female in her right\r\nplace, certainly.’ Skepsey supplicated honest interpretation of his\r\nhearer, and pursued,\r\n\r\n‘It would improve his physical strength, at the same time add to his\r\nsense of personal dignity.’\r\n\r\n‘Would you teach females as well--to divert them from their\r\nfrivolities?’\r\n\r\n‘That would have to be thought over, sir. It would be better for them\r\nthan using their nails.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know, Skepsey: I’m rather a Conservative there.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes; with regard to the female, sir: I confess, my scheme does not\r\ninclude them. They dance; that is a healthy exercise. One has only to\r\nsay, that it does not add to the national force, in case of emergency.\r\nI look to that. And I am particular in proposing an exercise independent\r\nof--I have to say--sex. Not that there is harm in sex. But we are for\r\ntraining. I hope my meaning is clear?’\r\n\r\n‘Quite. You would have boxing with the gloves to be a kind of monastic\r\nrecreation.’\r\n\r\n‘Recreation is the word, sir; I have often admired it,’ said Skepsey,\r\nblinking, unsure of the signification of monastic.\r\n\r\n‘I was a bit of a boxer once,’ Mr. Fenellan said, conscious of height\r\nand breadth in measuring the wisp of a figure before him.\r\n\r\n‘Something might be done with you still, sir.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey paid him the encomium after a respectful summary of his gifts in\r\na glimpse. Mr. Fenellan bowed to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor raised head from the notes he was pencilling upon letters\r\nperused.\r\n\r\n‘Skepsey’s craze: regeneration of the English race by boxing--nucleus of\r\na national army?’\r\n\r\n‘To face an enemy at close quarters--it teaches that, sir. I have always\r\nbeen of opinion, that courage may be taught. I do not say heroism. And\r\nsetting aside for a moment thoughts of an army, we create more valuable\r\ncitizens. Protection to the weak in streets and by-places--shocking\r\nexamples of ruffians maltreating women, in view of a crowd.’\r\n\r\n‘One strong man is an overmatch for your mob,’ said Mr. Fenellan.\r\n\r\nSkepsey toned his assent to the diminishing thinness where a suspicion\r\nof the negative begins to wind upon a distant horn.\r\n\r\n‘Knowing his own intentions; and before an ignorant mob:--strong, you\r\nsay, sir? I venture my word that a decent lad, with science, would beat\r\nhim. It is a question of the study and practice of first principles.’\r\n\r\n‘If you were to see a rascal giant mishandling a woman?’ Skepsey\r\nconjured the scene by bending his head and peering abstractedly, as if\r\nover spectacles.\r\n\r\n‘I would beg him to abstain, for his own sake.’\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan knew that the little fellow was not boasting.\r\n\r\n‘My brother Dartrey had a lesson or two from you in the first\r\nprinciples, I think?’\r\n\r\n‘Captain Dartrey is an athlete, sir: exceedingly quick and clever; a\r\nhard boxer to beat.’\r\n\r\n‘You will not call him captain when you see him; he has dismissed the\r\narmy.’\r\n\r\n‘I much regret it, sir, much, that we have lost him. Captain Dartrey\r\nFenellan was a beautiful fencer. He gave me some instruction; unhappily,\r\nI have to acknowledge, too late. It is a beautiful art. Captain Dartrey\r\nsays, the French excel at it. But it asks for a weapon, which nature has\r\nnot given: whereas the fists...’\r\n\r\n‘So,’ Mr. Radnor handed notes and papers to Skepsey: ‘No sign of life?’\r\n\r\n‘It is not yet seen in the City, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘The first principles of commercial activity have retreated to earth’s\r\nmaziest penetralia, where no tides are! is it not so, Skepsey?’ said\r\nMr. Fenellan, whose initiative and exuberance in loquency had been\r\nrestrained by a slight oppression, known to guests; especially to the\r\nguest in the earlier process of his magnification and illumination by\r\nvirtue of a grand old wine; and also when the news he has to communicate\r\nmay be a stir to unpleasant heaps. The shining lips and eyes of\r\nhis florid face now proclaimed speech, with his Puckish fancy\r\njack-o’-lanterning over it. ‘Business hangs to swing at every City door,\r\nlike a ragshop Doll, on the gallows of overproduction. Stocks and Shares\r\nare hollow nuts not a squirrel of the lot would stop to crack for sight\r\nof the milky kernel mouldered to beard.\r\n\r\nPercentage, like a cabman without a fare, has gone to sleep inside his\r\nvehicle. Dividend may just be seen by tiptoe: stockholders, twinkling\r\nheels over the far horizon. Too true!--and our merchants, brokers,\r\nbankers, projectors of Companies, parade our City to remind us of the\r\npoor steamed fellows trooping out of the burst-boiler-room of the big\r\nship Leviathan, in old years; a shade or two paler than the crowd o’ the\r\npassengers, apparently alive and conversible, but corpses, all of them\r\nto lie their length in fifteen minutes.’\r\n\r\n‘And you, Fenellan?’ cried his host, inspired for a second bottle by the\r\nlovely nonsense of a voluble friend wound up to the mark.\r\n\r\n‘Doctor of the ship! with this prescription!’ Mr. Fenellan held up his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n‘Empty?’\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan made it completely so. ‘Confident!’ he affirmed.\r\n\r\nAn order was tossed to the waiter, and both gentlemen screwed their\r\nlips in relish of his heavy consent to score off another bottle from the\r\nnarrow list.\r\n\r\n‘At the office in forty minutes,’ Skepsey’s master nodded to him and\r\nshot him forth, calling him back: ‘By the way, in case a man named\r\nJarniman should ask to see me, you turn him to the rightabout.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey repeated: ‘Jarniman!’ and flew.\r\n\r\n‘A good servant,’ Mr. Radnor said. ‘Few of us think of our country\r\nso much, whatever may be said of the specific he offers. Colney has\r\nimpressed him somehow immensely: he studies to write too; pushes to\r\nimprove himself; altogether a worthy creature.’\r\n\r\nThe second bottle appeared. The waiter, in sincerity a reluctant\r\nexecutioner, heightened his part for the edification of the admiring\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\n‘Take heart, Benjamin,’ said Mr. Fenellan; ‘it’s only the bottle dies;\r\nand we are the angels above to receive the spirit.’\r\n\r\n‘I’m thinking of the house,’ Benjamin replied. He told them that again.\r\n\r\n‘It ‘s the loss of the fame of having the wine, that he mourns. But,\r\nBenjamin,’ said Mr. Fenellan, ‘the fame enters into the partakers of it,\r\nand we spread it, and perpetuate it for you.’\r\n\r\n‘That don’t keep a house upright,’ returned Benjamin.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan murmured to himself: ‘True enough, it ‘s elegy--though we\r\nperform it through a trumpet; and there’s not a doubt of our being down\r\nor having knocked the world down, if we’re loudly praised.’\r\n\r\nBenjamin waited to hear approval sounded on the lips uncertain as a\r\nwoman is a wine of ticklish age. The gentlemen nodded, and he retired.\r\n\r\nA second bottle, just as good as the first, should, one thoughtlessly\r\nsupposes, procure us a similar reposeful and excursive enjoyment, as of\r\nmen lying on their backs and flying imagination like a kite. The effect\r\nwas quite other. Mr. Radnor drank hastily and spoke with heat: ‘You told\r\nme All? tell me that!’\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan gathered himself together; he sipped, and relaxed his\r\nbracing. But there really was a bit more to tell: not much, was it? Not\r\nlikely to puff a gale on the voluptuous indolence of a man drawn along\r\nby Nereids over sunny sea-waves to behold the birth of the Foam-Goddess?\r\n‘According to Carling, her lawyer; that is, he hints she meditates a\r\nblow.’\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Burman means to strike a blow?’\r\n\r\n‘The lady.’\r\n\r\n‘Does he think I fear any--does he mean a blow with a weapon? Is it a\r\nlegal...? At last? Fenellan!’\r\n\r\n‘So I fancied I understood.’\r\n\r\n‘But can the good woman dream of that as a blow to strike and hurt, for\r\na punishment?--that’s her one aim.’\r\n\r\n‘She may have her hallucinations.’\r\n\r\n‘But a blow--what a word for it! But it’s life to us life! It’s the blow\r\nwe’ve prayed for. Why, you know it! Let her strike, we bless her. We’ve\r\nnever had an ill feeling to the woman; utterly the contrary--pity, pity,\r\npity! Let her do that, we’re at her feet, my Nataly and I. If you knew\r\nwhat my poor girl suffers! She ‘s a saint at the stake. Chiefly on\r\nbehalf of her family. Fenellan, you may have a sort of guess at my\r\nfortune: I’ll own to luck; I put in a claim to courage and calculation.’\r\n\r\n‘You’ve been a bulwark to your friends.’\r\n\r\n‘All, Fenellan, all-stocks, shares, mines, companies, industries at\r\nhome and--abroad--all, at a sweep, to have the woman strike that blow!\r\nCheerfully would I begin to build a fortune over again--singing! Ha! the\r\nwoman has threatened it before. It’s probably feline play with us.’\r\n\r\nHis chin took support, he frowned.\r\n\r\n‘You may have touched her.’\r\n\r\n‘She won’t be touched, and she won’t be driven. What ‘s the secret of\r\nher? I can’t guess, I never could. She’s a riddle.’\r\n\r\n‘Riddles with wigs and false teeth have to be taken and shaken for the\r\nardently sought secret to reveal itself,’ said Mr. Fenellan.\r\n\r\nHis picture, with the skeleton issue of any shaking, smote Mr. Radnor’s\r\neyes, they turned over. ‘Oh!--her charms! She had a desperate belief\r\nin her beauty. The woman ‘s undoubtedly charitable; she’s not without a\r\nmind--sort of mind: well, it shows no crack till it’s put to use. Heart!\r\nyes, against me she has plenty of it. They say she used to be courted;\r\nshe talked of it: “my courtiers, Mr. Victor!” There, heaven forgive me,\r\nI wouldn’t mock at her to another.’\r\n\r\n‘It looks as if she were only inexorably human,’ said Mr. Fenellan,\r\ncrushing a delicious gulp of the wine, that foamed along the channel to\r\nflavour. ‘We read of the tester of a bandit-bed; and it flattened unwary\r\nrecumbents to pancakes. An escape from the like of that seems pleadable,\r\nshould be: none but the drowsy would fail to jump out and run, or the\r\ninsane.’\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor was taken with the illustration of his case. ‘For the sake of\r\nmy sanity, it was! to preserve my.... but any word makes nonsense of\r\nit. Could--I must ask you--could any sane man--you were abroad in those\r\ndays, horrible days! and never met her: I say, could you consent to\r\nbe tied--I admit the vow, ceremony, so forth-tied to--I was\r\nbarely twenty-one: I put it to you, Fenellan, was it in reason an\r\nengagement--which is, I take it, a mutual plight of faith, in good\r\nfaith; that is, with capacity on both sides to keep the engagement:\r\nbetween the man you know I was in youth and a more than middle-aged\r\nwoman crazy up to the edge of the cliff--as Colney says half the world\r\nis, and she positively is when her spite is roused. No, Fenellan, I have\r\nnothing on my conscience with regard to the woman. She had wealth: I\r\nleft her not one penny the worse for--but she was not one to reckon it,\r\nI own. She could be generous, was, with her money. If she had struck\r\nthis blow--I know she thought of it: or if she would strike it now, I\r\ncould not only forgive her, I could beg forgiveness.’\r\n\r\nA sight of that extremity fetched prickles to his forehead.\r\n\r\n‘You’ve borne your part bravely, my friend.’\r\n\r\n‘I!’ Mr. Radnor shrugged at mention of his personal burdens. ‘Praise my\r\nNataly if you like! Made for one another, if ever two in this world! You\r\nknow us both, and do you doubt it? The sin would have been for us two to\r\nmeet and--but enough when I say, that I am she, she me, till death and\r\nbeyond it: that’s my firm faith. Nataly teaches me the religion of\r\nlife, and you may learn what that is when you fall in love with a woman.\r\nEighteen-nineteen-twenty years!’\r\n\r\nTears fell from him, two drops. He blinked, bugled in his throat, eyed\r\nhis watch, and smiled: ‘The finishing glass! We should have had to put\r\nColney to bed. Few men stand their wine. You and I are not lamed by it;\r\nwe can drink and do business: my first experience in the City was,\r\nthat the power to drink--keeping a sound head--conduces to the doing of\r\nbusiness.’\r\n\r\n‘It’s a pleasant way of instructing men to submit to their conqueror.’\r\n\r\n‘If it doubles the energies, mind.’\r\n\r\n‘Not if it fiddles inside. I confess to that effect upon me. I’ve a\r\nwaltz going on, like the snake with the tail in his mouth, eternal; and\r\nit won’t allow of a thought upon Investments.’\r\n\r\n‘Consult me to-morrow,’ said Mr. Radnor, somewhat pained for having\r\ninconsiderately misled the man he had hitherto helpfully guided. ‘You’ve\r\nlooked at the warehouse?’\r\n\r\n‘That’s performed.’\r\n\r\n‘Make a practice of getting over as much of your business in the early\r\nmorning as you well can.’\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor added hints of advice to a frail humanity he was indulgent,\r\nthe giant spoke in good fellowship. It would have been to have strained\r\nhis meaning, for purposes of sarcasm upon him, if one had taken him to\r\nboast of a personal exemption from our common weakness.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and laughed: ‘Now I ‘m pumping my pulpit-eh? You come with\r\nus to Lakelands. I drive the ladies down to my office, ten A.M.: if it’s\r\nfine; train half-past. We take a basket. By the way, I had no letter\r\nfrom Dartrey last mail.’\r\n\r\n‘He has buried his wife. It happens to some men.’\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor stood gazing. He asked for the name of the place of the\r\nburial. He heard without seizing it. A simulacrum spectre-spark of\r\nhopefulness shot up in his imagination, glowed and quivered, darkening\r\nat the utterance of the Dutch syllables, leaving a tinge of witless\r\nenvy. Dartrey--Fenellan had buried the wife whose behaviour vexed and\r\ndishonoured him: and it was in Africa! One would have to go to Africa\r\nto be free of the galling. But Dartrey had gone, and he was free!--The\r\nstrange faint freaks of our sensations when struck to leap and throw off\r\ntheir load after a long affliction, play these disorderly pranks on the\r\nbrain; and they are faint, but they come in numbers, they are recurring,\r\nalways in ambush. We do not speak of them: we have not words to stamp\r\nthe indefinite things; generally we should leave them unspoken if we had\r\nthe words; we know them as out of reason: they haunt us, pluck at us,\r\nfret us, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nDartrey free, he was relieved of the murderous drama incessantly in the\r\nmind of shackled men.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like one of the miracles of a divine intervention, that\r\nDartrey should be free, suddenly free; and free while still a youngish\r\nman. He was in himself a wonderful fellow, the pick of his country\r\nfor vigour, gallantry, trustiness, high-mindedness; his heavenly good\r\nfortune decked him as a prodigy.\r\n\r\n‘No harm to the head from that fall of yours?’ Mr. Fenellan said.\r\n\r\n‘None.’ Mr. Radnor withdrew his hand from head to hat, clapped it on and\r\ncried cheerily: ‘Now to business’; as men may, who have confidence in\r\ntheir ability to concentrate an instant attention upon the substantial.\r\n‘You dine with us. The usual Quartet: Peridon, Pempton, Colney, Yatt, or\r\nCatkin: Priscilla Graves and Nataly--the Rev. Septimus; Cormyn and his\r\nwife: Young Dudley Sowerby and I--flutes: he has precision, as naughty\r\nFredi said, when some one spoke of expression. In the course of the\r\nevening, Lady Grace, perhaps: you like her.’\r\n\r\n‘Human nature in the upper circle is particularly likeable.’\r\n\r\n‘Fenellan,’ said Mr. Radnor, emboldened to judge hopefully of his\r\nfortunes by mere pressure of the thought of Dartrey’s, ‘I put it to\r\nyou: would you say, that there is anything this time behind your friend\r\nCarling’s report?’\r\n\r\nAlthough it had not been phrased as a report, Mr. Fenellan’s answering\r\nlook and gesture, and a run of indiscriminate words, enrolled it in that\r\nform, greatly to the inspiriting of Mr. Radnor.\r\n\r\nOld Veuve in one, to the soul of Old Veuve in the other, they recalled\r\na past day or two, touched the skies; and merriment or happiness in\r\nthe times behind them held a mirror to the present: or the hour of the\r\nreverse of happiness worked the same effect by contrast: so that notions\r\nof the singular election of us by Dame Fortune, sprang like vinous\r\nbubbles. For it is written, that however powerful you be, you shall not\r\ntake the Winegod on board to entertain him as a simple passenger;\r\nand you may captain your vessel, you may pilot it, and keep to your\r\nreckonings, and steer for all the ports you have a mind to, even to\r\ndoing profitable exchange with Armenian and Jew, and still you shall do\r\nthe something more, which proves that the Winegod is on board: he is the\r\npilot of your blood if not the captain of your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan was unused to the copious outpouring of Victor Radnor’s\r\nconfidences upon his domestic affairs; and the unwonted excitement of\r\nVictor’s manner of speech would have perplexed him, had there not been\r\nsuch a fiddling of the waltz inside him.\r\n\r\nPayment for the turtle and the bottles of Old Veuve was performed\r\napart with Benjamin, while Simeon Fenellan strolled out of the\r\nhouse, questioning a tumbled mind as to what description of suitable\r\nentertainment, which would be dancing and flirting and fal-lallery in\r\nthe season of youth, London City could provide near meridian hours for\r\na man of middle age carrying his bottle of champagne, like a guest of an\r\nold-fashioned wedding-breakfast. For although he could stand his wine\r\nas well as his friend, his friend’s potent capacity martially after the\r\nfeast to buckle to business at a sign of the clock, was beyond him. It\r\npointed to one of the embodied elements, hot from Nature’s workshop. It\r\ntold of the endurance of powers, that partly explained the successful,\r\nastonishing career of his friend among a people making urgent, if\r\nunequal, demands perpetually upon stomach and head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE LONDON WALK WESTWARD\r\n\r\nIn that nationally interesting Poem, or Dramatic Satire, once famous,\r\nTHE RAJAH IN LONDON (London, Limbo and Sons, 1889), now obliterated\r\nunder the long wash of Press-matter, the reflection--not unknown to\r\nphilosophical observers, and natural perhaps in the mind of an Oriental\r\nPrince--produced by his observation of the march of London citizens\r\nEastward at morn, Westward at eve, attributes their practice to a\r\nsurvival of the Zoroastrian form of worship. His Minister, favourable\r\nto the people or for the sake of fostering an idea in his Master’s head,\r\nremarks, that they show more than the fidelity of the sunflower to her\r\nGod. The Rajah, it would appear, frowns interrogatively, in the princely\r\nfashion, accusing him of obscureness of speech:--princes and the louder\r\nmembers of the grey public are fraternally instant to spurn at the whip\r\nof that which they do not immediately comprehend. It is explained by the\r\nMinister: not even the flower, he says, would hold constant, as they,\r\nto the constantly unseen--a trebly cataphractic Invisible. The Rajah\r\nprofesses curiosity to know how it is that the singular people nourish\r\ntheir loyalty, since they cannot attest to the continued being of the\r\nobject in which they put their faith. He is informed by his prostrate\r\nservant of a settled habit they have of diligently seeking their\r\nDivinity, hidden above, below; and of copiously taking inside them doses\r\nof what is denied to their external vision: thus they fortify credence\r\nchemically on an abundance of meats and liquors; fire they eat, and they\r\ndrink fire; they become consequently instinct with fire. Necessarily\r\ntherefore they believe in fire. Believing, they worship. Worshipping,\r\nthey march Eastward at morn, Westward at eve. For that way lies the key,\r\nthis way the cupboard, of the supplies, their fuel.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stage directions, THE RAJAH AND HIS MINISTER Enter a\r\nGin-Palace.--It is to witness a service that they have learnt to\r\nappreciate as Anglicanly religious.\r\n\r\nOn the step of the return to their Indian clime, they speak of the\r\nhatted sect, which is most, or most commercially, succoured and fattened\r\nby our rule there: they wave adieu to the conquering Islanders, as to\r\n‘Parsees beneath a cloud.’\r\n\r\nThe two are seen last on the deck of the vessel, in perusal of a medical\r\npamphlet composed of statistics and sketches, traceries, horrid blots,\r\ndiagrams with numbers referring to notes, of the various maladies caused\r\nby the prolonged prosecution of that form of worship.\r\n\r\n‘But can they suffer so and live?’ exclaims the Rajah, vexed by the\r\nphysical sympathetic twinges which set him wincing.\r\n\r\n‘Science,’ his Minister answers, ‘took them up where Nature, in pity\r\nof their martyrdom, dropped them. They do not live; they are engines,\r\ninsensible things of repairs and patches; insteamed to pursue their\r\ninfuriate course, to the one end of exhausting supplies for the renewing\r\nof them, on peril of an instant suspension if they deviate a step or\r\nstop: nor do they.’\r\n\r\nThe Rajah is of opinion, that he sails home with the key of the riddle\r\nof their power to vanquish. In some apparent allusion to an Indian story\r\nof a married couple who successfully made their way, he accounts for\r\ntheir solid and resistless advance, resembling that of--\r\n\r\n             The doubly-wedded man and wife,\r\n        Pledged to each other and against the world\r\n        With mutual union.\r\n\r\nOne would like to think of the lengthened tide-flux of pedestrian\r\ncitizens facing South-westward, as being drawn by devout attraction to\r\nour nourishing luminary: at the hour, mark, when the Norland cloud-king,\r\nafter a day of wild invasion, sits him on his restful bank of bluefish\r\nsmack-o’-cheek red above Whitechapel, to spy where his last puff of icy\r\njavelins pierces and dismembers the vapoury masses in cluster about\r\nthe circle of flame descending upon the greatest and most elevated of\r\nAdmirals at the head of the Strand, with illumination of smoke-plumed\r\nchimneys, house-roofs, window-panes, weather-vanes, monument and\r\npedimental monsters, and omnibus umbrella. One would fair believe that\r\nthey advance admireing; they are assuredly made handsome by the beams.\r\nNo longer mere concurrent atoms of the furnace of business (from\r\ncoal-dust to sparks, rushing, as it were, on respiratory blasts of an\r\nenormous engine’s centripetal and centrifugal energy), their step is\r\nleisurely to meet the rosy Dinner, which is ever a see-saw with the God\r\nof Light in his fall; the mask of the noble human visage upon them\r\nis not roughened, as at midday, by those knotted hard ridges of the\r\nscrambler’s hand seen from forehead down to jaw; when indeed they have\r\nall the appearance of sour scientific productions. And unhappily for\r\nthe national portrait, in the Poem quoted, the Rajah’s Minister chose\r\nan hour between morning and meridian, or at least before an astonished\r\nluncheon had come to composure inside their persons, for drawing his\r\nMaster’s attention to the quaint similarity of feature in the units of\r\nthe busy antish congregates they had travelled so far to visit and to\r\nstudy:\r\n\r\n               These Britons wear\r\n        The driven and perplexed look of men\r\n        Begotten hastily ‘twixt business hours\r\n\r\nIt could not have been late afternoon.\r\n\r\nThese Orientals should have seen them, with Victor Radnor among them,\r\nfronting the smoky splendours of the sunset. In April, the month of\r\npiled and hurried cloud, it is a Rape of the Sabines overhead from\r\nall quarters, either one of the winds brawnily larcenous; and London,\r\nsmoking royally to the open skies, builds images of a dusty epic fray\r\nfor possession of the portly dames. There is immensity, swinging motion,\r\ncollision, dusky richness of colouring, to the sight; and to the mind\r\nidea. London presents it. If we can allow ourselves a moment for not\r\ninquireing scrupulously (you will do it by inhaling the aroma of the\r\nripe kitchen hour), here is a noble harmony of heaven and the earth of\r\nthe works of man, speaking a grander tongue than barren sea or wood or\r\nwilderness. Just a moment; it goes; as, when a well-attuned barrel-organ\r\nin a street has drawn us to recollections of the Opera or Italy, another\r\nharshly crashes, and the postman knocks at doors, and perchance a\r\ncostermonger cries his mash of fruit, a beggar woman wails her hymn. For\r\nthe pinched are here, the dinnerless, the weedy, the gutter-growths,\r\nthe forces repressing them. That grand tongue of the giant City\r\ninspires none human to Bardic eulogy while we let those discords be. An\r\nembittered Muse of Reason prompts her victims to the composition of\r\nthe adulatory Essay and of the Leading Article, that she may satiate an\r\nangry irony ‘upon those who pay fee for their filling with the stuff.\r\nSong of praise she does not permit. A moment of satisfaction in a\r\nstriking picture is accorded, and no more. For this London, this\r\nEngland, Europe, world, but especially this London, is rather a thing\r\nfor hospital operations than for poetic rhapsody; in aspect, too,\r\nstreaked scarlet and pock-pitted under the most cumbrous of jewelled\r\ntiaras; a Titanic work of long-tolerated pygmies; of whom the leaders,\r\nuntil sorely discomforted in body and doubtful in soul, will give\r\ngold and labour, will impose restrictions upon activity, to maintain\r\na conservatism of diseases. Mind is absent, or somewhere so low down\r\nbeneath material accumulations that it is inexpressive, powerless to\r\ndrive the ponderous bulk to such excisings, purgeings, purifyings as\r\nmight--as may, we will suppose, render it acceptable, for a theme of\r\npanegyric, to the Muse of Reason; ultimately, with her consent, to the\r\nSpirit of Song.\r\n\r\nBut first there must be the cleansing. When Night has fallen upon\r\nLondon, the Rajah remarks:\r\n\r\n        Monogamic Societies present\r\n        A decent visage and a hideous rear.\r\n\r\nHis Minister (satirically, or in sympathetic Conservatism) would\r\nhave them not to move on, that they may preserve among beholders the\r\nimpression of their handsome frontage. Night, however, will come; and\r\nthey, adoreing the decent face, are moved on, made to expose what the\r\nRajah sees. Behind his courteousness, he is an antagonistic observer of\r\nhis conquerors; he pushes his questions farther than the need for them;\r\nhis Minister the same; apparently to retain the discountenanced people\r\nin their state of exposure. Up to the time of the explanation of the\r\npuzzle on board the departing vessel (on the road to Windsor, at the\r\nPremier’s reception, in the cell of the Police, in the presence of the\r\nMagistrate-whose crack of a totally inverse decision upon their\r\ncase, when he becomes acquainted with the titles and station of\r\nthese imputedly peccant, refreshes them), they hold debates over the\r\nmysterious contrarieties of a people professing in one street what they\r\nconfound in the next, and practising by day a demureness that yells with\r\nthe cat of the tiles at night.\r\n\r\nGranting all that, it being a transient novelist’s business to please\r\nthe light-winged hosts which live for the hour, and give him his only\r\nchance of half of it, let him identify himself with them, in keeping to\r\nthe quadrille on the surface and shirking the disagreeable.\r\n\r\nClouds of high colour above London City are as the light of the Goddess\r\nto lift the angry heroic head over human. They gloriously transfigure.\r\nA Murillo beggar is not more precious than sight of London in any of the\r\nstreets admitting coloured cloud-scenes; the cunning of the sun’s hand\r\nso speaks to us. And if haply down an alley some olive mechanic of\r\nstreet-organs has quickened little children’s legs to rhythmic footing,\r\nthey strike on thoughts braver than pastoral. Victor Radnor, lover of\r\nthe country though he was, would have been the first to say it. He\r\nwould indeed have said it too emphatically. Open London as a theme, to a\r\ncitizen of London ardent for the clear air out of it, you have roused\r\nan orator; you have certainly fired a magazine, and must listen to his\r\nreminiscences of one of its paragraphs or pages.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the hurtled fair ones in sky were wreathing Nelson’s\r\ncocked hat when Victor, distinguishably bright-faced amid a crowd of\r\nthe irradiated, emerged from the tideway to cross the square, having\r\nthoughts upon Art, which were due rather to the suggestive proximity of\r\nthe National Gallery than to the Flemish mouldings of cloud-forms under\r\nVenetian brushes. His purchases of pictures had been his unhappiest\r\nventures. He had relied and reposed on the dicta of newspaper critics;\r\nwho are sometimes unanimous, and are then taken for guides, and are\r\nfatal. He was led to the conclusion that our modern-lauded pictures do\r\nnot ripen. They have a chance of it, if abused. But who thinks of\r\nbuying the abused? Exalted by the critics, they have, during the days\r\nof Exhibition, a glow, a significance or a fun, abandoning them where\r\nexamination is close and constant, and the critic’s trumpet-note\r\ndispersed to the thinness of the fee for his blowing. As to foreign\r\npictures, classic pictures, Victor had known his purse to leap for a\r\nRaphael with a history in stages of descent from the Master, and critics\r\nto swarm: a Raphael of the dealers, exposed to be condemned by\r\nthe critics, universally derided. A real Raphael in your house is\r\naristocracy to the roof-tree. But the wealthy trader will reach to title\r\nbefore he may hope to get the real Raphael or a Titian. Yet he is the\r\none who would, it may be, after enjoyment of his prize, bequeath it to\r\nthe nation--PRESENTED TO THE NATION BY VICTOR MONTGOMERY RADNOR. There\r\nstood the letters in gilt; and he had a thrill of his generosity;\r\nfor few were the generous acts he could not perform; and if an object\r\nhaunted the deed, it came of his trader’s habit of mind.\r\n\r\nHe revelled in benevolent projects of gifts to the nation, which\r\nwould coat a sensitive name. Say, an ornamental City Square, flowers,\r\nfountains, afternoon bands of music--comfortable seats in it, and a\r\nshelter, and a ready supply of good cheap coffee or tea. Tobacco? why\r\nnot rolls of honest tobacco! nothing so much soothes the labourer. A\r\nvolume of plans for the benefit of London smoked out of each ascending\r\npile in his brain. London is at night a moaning outcast round the\r\npoliceman’s’ legs. What of an all-night-long, cosy, brightly lighted,\r\nodoriferous coffee-saloon for rich or poor, on the model of the\r\nhospitable Paduan? Owner of a penny, no soul among us shall be rightly\r\nan outcast....\r\n\r\nDreams of this kind are taken at times by wealthy people as a cordial\r\nat the bar of benevolent intentions. But Victor was not the man to steal\r\nhis refreshments in that known style. He meant to make deeds of them, as\r\nfar as he could, considering their immense extension; and except for the\r\nsensitive social name, he was of single-minded purpose.\r\n\r\nTurning to the steps of a chemist’s shop to get a prescription made up\r\nfor his Nataly’s doctoring of her domestics, he was arrested by a rap\r\non his elbow; and no one was near; and there could not be a doubt of\r\nthe blow--a sharp hard stroke, sparing the funny-bone, but ringing. His\r\nhead, at the punctilio bump, throbbed responsively--owing to which\r\nor indifference to the prescription, as of no instant requirement,\r\nhe pursued his course, resembling mentally the wanderer along a misty\r\nbeach, who hears cannon across the waters.\r\n\r\nHe certainly had felt it. He remembered the shock: he could not remember\r\nmuch of pain. How about intimations? His asking caused a smile.\r\n\r\nVery soon the riddle answered itself. He had come into view of the\r\ndiminutive marble cavalier of the infantile cerebellum; recollecting a\r\ncouplet from the pen of the disrespectful Satirist Peter, he thought of\r\na fall: his head and his elbow responded simultaneously to the thought.\r\n\r\nAll was explained save his consequent rightabout from the chemist’s\r\nshop: and that belongs to the minor involutions of circumstances and\r\nthe will. It passed like a giver’s wrinkle. He read the placards of the\r\nOpera; reminding himself of the day when it was the single Opera-house;\r\nand now we have two-or three. We have also a distracting couple of\r\nClowns and Pantaloons in our Pantomimes: though Colney says that the\r\nmultiplication of the pantaloon is a distinct advance to representative\r\ntruth--and bother Colney! Two Columbines also. We forbear to speak\r\nof men, but where is the boy who can set his young heart upon two\r\nColumbines at once! Victor felt the boy within him cold to both: and in\r\nhis youth he had doated on the solitary twirling spangled lovely Fairy.\r\nThe tale of a delicate lady dancer leaping as the kernel out of a nut\r\nfrom the arms of Harlequin to the legalized embrace of a wealthy brewer,\r\nand thenceforth living, by repute, with unagitated legs, as holy\r\na matron, despite her starry past, as any to be shown in a country\r\nbreeding the like abundantly, had always delighted him. It seemed a\r\nreconcilement of opposing stations, a defeat of Puritanism. Ay, and poor\r\nwomen!--women in the worser plight under the Puritan’s eye. They may be\r\nerring and good: yes, finding the man to lift them the one step up! Read\r\nthe history of the error. But presently we shall teach the Puritan to\r\nact by the standards of his religion. All is coming right--must come\r\nright. Colney shall be confounded.\r\n\r\nHereupon Victor hopped on to Fenellan’s hint regarding the designs of\r\nMrs. Burman.\r\n\r\nHis Nataly might have to go through a short sharp term of\r\nscorching--Godiva to the gossips.\r\n\r\nShe would come out of it glorified. She would be reconciled with her\r\nfamily. With her story of her devotion to the man loving her, the world\r\nwould know her for the heroine she was: a born lady, in appearance\r\nand manner an empress among women. It was a story to be pleaded in\r\nany court, before the sternest public. Mrs. Burman had thrown her into\r\ntemptation’s way. It was a story to touch the heart, as none other ever\r\nwritten of over all the earth was there a woman equalling his Nataly!\r\n\r\nAnd their Nesta would have a dowry to make princesses envious:--she\r\nwould inherit... he ran up an arithmetical column, down to a line of\r\nfigures in addition, during three paces of his feet. Dartrey Fenellan\r\nhad said of little Nesta once, that she had a nature pure and sparkling\r\nas mid-sea foam. Happy he who wins her! But she was one of the young\r\nwomen who are easily pleased and hardly enthralled. Her father strained\r\nhis mind for the shape of the man to accomplish the feat. Whether she\r\nhad an ideal of a youth in her feminine head, was beyond his guessing.\r\nShe was not the damsel to weave a fairy waistcoat for the identical\r\nprince, and try it upon all comers to discover him: as is done by\r\nsome; excuseably, if we would be just. Nesta was of the elect, for whom\r\nexcuses have not to be made. She would probably like a flute-player\r\nbest; because her father played the flute, and she loved him--laughably\r\na little maiden’s reason! Her father laughed at her.\r\n\r\nAlong the street of Clubs, where a bruised fancy may see black balls\r\nraining, the narrow way between ducal mansions offers prospect of the\r\nsweep of greensward, all but touching up to the sunset to draw it to the\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nFormerly, in his very early youth, he clasped a dream of gaining way\r\nto an alliance with one of these great surrounding houses; and he had\r\na passion for the acquisition of money as a means. And it has to be\r\nconfessed, he had sacrificed in youth a slice of his youth, to gain it\r\nwithout labour--usually a costly purchase. It had ended disastrously:\r\nor say, a running of the engine off the rails, and a speedy\r\nre-establishment of traffic. Could it be a loss, that had led to the\r\nwinning of his Nataly? Can we really loathe the first of the steps when\r\nthe one in due sequence, cousin to it, is a blessedness? If we have been\r\nrighted to health by a medical draught, we are bound to be respectful to\r\nour drug. And so we are, in spite of Nature’s wry face and shiver at\r\na mention of what we went through during those days, those horrible\r\ndays:--hide them!\r\n\r\nThe smothering of them from sight set them sounding he had to listen.\r\nColney Durance accused him of entering into bonds with somebody’s\r\ngrandmother for the simple sake of browsing on her thousands: a picture\r\nof himself too abhorrent to Victor to permit of any sort of acceptance.\r\nConsequently he struck away to the other extreme of those who have a\r\nchoice in mixed motives: he protested that compassion had been the cause\r\nof it. Looking at the circumstance now, he could see, allowing for human\r\nfrailty-perhaps a wish to join the ranks of the wealthy compassion for\r\nthe woman as the principal motive. How often had she not in those old\r\ndays praised his generosity for allying his golden youth to her withered\r\nage--Mrs. Burman’s very words! And she was a generous woman or had been:\r\nshe was generous in saying that. Well, and she was generous in having\r\na well-born, well-bred beautiful young creature like Nataly for\r\nher companion, when it was a case of need for the dear girl; and\r\ncompassionately insisting, against remonstrances: they were spoken by\r\nhim, though they were but partial. How, then, had she become--at least,\r\nhow was it that she could continue to behave as the vindictive Fury who\r\npersecuted remorselessly, would give no peace, poisoned the wells round\r\nevery place where he and his dear one pitched their tent!\r\n\r\nBut at last she had come to charity, as he could well believe. Not too\r\nlate! Victor’s feeling of gratitude to Mrs. Burman assured him it was\r\ngenuine because of his genuine conviction, that she had determined to\r\nend her incomprehensibly lengthened days in reconcilement with him: and\r\nhe had always been ready to ‘forget and forgive.’ A truly beautiful old\r\nphrase! It thrilled off the most susceptible of men.\r\n\r\nHis well-kept secret of the spacious country-house danced him behind a\r\nsober demeanour from one park to another; and along beside the drive\r\nto view of his townhouse--unbeloved of the inhabitants, although by\r\nacknowledgement it had, as Fredi funnily drawled, to express her sense\r\nof justice in depreciation, ‘good accommodation.’ Nataly was at home,\r\nhe was sure. Time to be dressing: sun sets at six-forty, he said, and\r\nglanced at the stained West, with an accompanying vision of outspread\r\nprimroses flooding banks of shadowy fields near Lakelands.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the road and rang.\r\n\r\nUpon the opening of the door, there was a cascade of muslin downstairs.\r\nHis darling Fredi stood out of it, a dramatic Undine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. NATALY\r\n\r\n‘Il segreto!’ the girl cried commandingly, with a forefinger at his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nHe crossed arms, toning in similar recitative, with anguish, ‘Dove\r\nvolare!’\r\n\r\nThey joined in half a dozen bars of operatic duet.\r\n\r\nShe flew to him, embraced and kissed.\r\n\r\n‘I must have it, my papa! unlock. I’ve been spying the bird on its\r\nhedgerow nest so long! And this morning, my own dear cunning papa,\r\nweren’t you as bare as winter twigs? “Tomorrow perhaps we will have a\r\nday in the country.” To go and see the nest? Only, please, not a big\r\none. A real nest; where mama and I can wear dairymaid’s hat and apron\r\nall day--the style you like; and strike roots. We’ve been torn away two\r\nor three times: twice, I know.’\r\n\r\n‘Fixed, this time; nothing shall tear us up,’ said her father, moving on\r\nto the stairs, with an arm about her.\r\n\r\n‘So, it is...?’\r\n\r\n‘She’s amazed at her cleverness!’\r\n\r\n‘A nest for three?’\r\n\r\n‘We must have a friend or two.’\r\n\r\n‘And pretty country?’\r\n\r\n‘Trust her papa for that.’\r\n\r\n‘Nice for walking and running over fields? No rich people?’\r\n\r\n‘How escape that rabble in England! as Colney says. It’s a place for\r\nbeing quite independent of neighbours, free as air.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! bravo!’\r\n\r\n‘And Fredi will have her horse, and mama her pony-carriage; and Fredi\r\ncan have a swim every Summer morning.’\r\n\r\n‘A swim?’ Her note was dubious. ‘A river?’\r\n\r\n‘A good long stretch--fairish, fairish. Bit of a lake; bathing-shed; the\r\nNaiad’s bower: pretty water to see.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah. And has the house a name?’\r\n\r\n‘Lakelands. I like the name.’\r\n\r\n‘Papa gave it the name!’\r\n\r\n‘There’s nothing he can conceal from his girl. Only now and then a\r\nlittle surprise.’\r\n\r\n‘And his girl is off her head with astonishment. But tell me, who has\r\nbeen sharing the secret with you?’\r\n\r\n‘Fredi strikes home! And it is true, you dear; I must have a confidant:\r\nSimeon Fenellan.’\r\n\r\n‘Not Mr. Durance?’\r\n\r\nHe shook out a positive negative. ‘I leave Col to his guesses. He’d have\r\nbeen prophesying fire the works before the completion.’\r\n\r\n‘Then it is not a dear old house, like Craye and Creckholt?’\r\n\r\n‘Wait and see to-morrow.’\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the customary guests for concert practice; the music,\r\ninstrumental and vocal; quartet, duet, solo; and advising the girl to be\r\nquick, as she had but twenty-five minutes, he went humming and trilling\r\ninto his dressing-room.\r\n\r\nNesta signalled at her mother’s door for permission to enter. She\r\nslipped in, saw that the maid was absent, and said: ‘Yes, mama; and\r\nprepare, I feared it; I was sure.’\r\n\r\nHer mother breathed a little moan: ‘Not a cottage?’\r\n\r\n‘He has not mentioned it to Mr. Durance.’\r\n\r\n‘Why not?’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Fenellan has been his confidant.’\r\n\r\n‘My darling, we did wrong to let it go on, without speaking. You don’t\r\nknow for certain yet?’\r\n\r\n‘It’s a large estate, mama, and a big new house.’\r\n\r\nNataly’s bosom sank. ‘Ah me! here’s misery! I ought to have known.\r\nAnd too late now it has gone so far! But I never imagined he would be\r\nbuilding.’\r\n\r\nShe caught herself languishing at her toilette-glass, as, if her beauty\r\nwere at stake; and shut her eyelids angrily. To be looking in that\r\nmanner, for a mere suspicion, was too foolish. But Nesta’s divinations\r\nwere target-arrows; they flew to the mark. Could it have been expected\r\nthat Victor would ever do anything on a small scale? O the dear little\r\nlost lost cottage! She thought of it with a strain of the arms of\r\nwomanhood’s longing in the unblessed wife for a babe. For the secluded\r\nmodest cottage would not rack her with the old anxieties, beset her with\r\nsuspicions....\r\n\r\n‘My child, you won’t possibly have time before the dinner-hour,’ she\r\nsaid to Nesta, dismissing her and taking her kiss of comfort with a\r\nshort and straining look out of the depths.\r\n\r\nThose bitter doubts of the sentiments of neighbours are an incipient\r\ndislike, when one’s own feelings to the neighbours are kind, could be\r\naffectionate. We are distracted, perverted, made strangers to ourselves\r\nby a false position.\r\n\r\nShe heard his voice on a carol. Men do not feel this doubtful position\r\nas women must. They have not the same to endure; the world gives them\r\nland to tread, where women are on breaking seas. Her Nesta knew no more\r\nthan the pain of being torn from a home she loved. But now the girl\r\nwas older, and if once she had her imagination awakened, her fearful\r\ndirectness would touch the spot, question, bring on the scene to-come,\r\nnecessarily to come, dreaded much more than death by her mother. But\r\nif it might be postponed till the girl was nearer to an age of grave\r\nunderstanding, with some knowledge of our world, some comprehension of a\r\ncase that could be pleaded!\r\n\r\nHe sang: he never acknowledged a trouble, he dispersed it; and in her\r\npresent wrestle with the scheme of a large country estate involving new\r\nintimacies, anxieties, the courtship of rival magnates, followed by the\r\nwretched old cloud, and the imposition upon them to bear it in silence\r\nthough they knew they could plead a case, at least before charitable and\r\ndiscerning creatures or before heaven, the despondent lady could have\r\nasked whether he was perfectly sane.\r\n\r\nWho half so brilliantly!--Depreciation of him, fetched up at a stroke\r\nthe glittering armies of her enthusiasm. He had proved it; he proved it\r\ndaily in conflicts and in victories that dwarfed emotional troubles\r\nlike hers: yet they were something to bear, hard to bear, at times\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\nBut those were times of weakness. Let anything be doubted rather than\r\nthe good guidance of the man who was her breath of life! Whither he led,\r\nlet her go, not only submissively, exultingly.\r\n\r\nThus she thought, under pressure of the knowledge, that unless rushing\r\ninto conflicts bigger than conceivable, she had to do it, and should\r\ntherefore think it.\r\n\r\nThis was the prudent woman’s clear deduction from the state wherein she\r\nfound herself, created by the one first great step of the mad woman.\r\nHer surrender then might be likened to the detachment of a flower on the\r\nriver’s bank by swell of flood: she had no longer root of her own; away\r\nshe sailed, through beautiful scenery, with occasionally a crashing\r\nfall, a turmoil, emergence from a vortex, and once more the sunny\r\nwhirling surface. Strange to think, she had not since then power to\r\ngrasp in her abstract mind a notion of stedfastness without or within.\r\n\r\nBut, say not the mad, say the enamoured woman. Love is a madness, having\r\nheaven’s wisdom in it--a spark. But even when it is driving us on the\r\nbreakers, call it love: and be not unworthy of it, hold to it. She and\r\nVictor had drunk of a cup. The philtre was in her veins, whatever the\r\ndirections of the rational mind.\r\n\r\nExulting or regretting, she had to do it, as one in the car with a\r\nracing charioteer. Or up beside a more than Titanically audacious\r\nballoonist. For the charioteer is bent on a goal; and Victor’s course\r\nwas an ascension from heights to heights. He had ideas, he mastered\r\nFortune. He conquered Nataly and held her subject, in being above his\r\nambition; which was now but an occupation for his powers, while the aim\r\nof his life was at the giving and taking of simple enjoyment. In spite\r\nof his fits of unreasonableness in the means--and the woman loving\r\nhim could trace them to a breath of nature--his gentle good friendly\r\ninnocent aim in life was of this very simplest; so wonderful, by\r\ncontrast with his powers, that she, assured of it as she was by\r\nexperience of him, was touched, in a transfusion of her feelings through\r\nlucent globes of admiration and of tenderness, to reverence. There\r\nhad been occasions when her wish for the whole world to have proof and\r\nexhibition of his greatness, goodness, and simplicity amid his gifts,\r\nprompted her incitement of him to stand forth eminently: [‘lead a\r\nkingdom,’ was the phrase behind the curtain within her shy bosom;) and\r\nit revealed her to herself, upon reflection, as being still the Nataly\r\nwho drank the cup with him, to join her fate with his.\r\n\r\nAnd why not? Was that regretted? Far from it. In her maturity, the woman\r\nwas unable to send forth any dwelling thought or more than a flight\r\nof twilight fancy, that cancelled the deed of her youth, and therewith\r\nseemed to expunge near upon the half--of her term of years. If it came\r\nto consideration of her family and the family’s opinion of her conduct,\r\nher judgement did not side with them or with herself, it whirled, swam\r\nto a giddiness and subsided.\r\n\r\nOf course, if she and Victor were to inhabit a large country-house, they\r\nmight as well have remained at Craye Farm or at Creckholt; both places\r\ndear to them in turn. Such was the plain sense of the surface\r\nquestion. And how strange it was to her, that he, of the most quivering\r\nsensitiveness on her behalf; could not see, that he threw her into\r\nsituations where hard words of men and women threatened about her head;\r\nwhere one or two might on a day, some day, be heard; and where, in the\r\nrecollection of two years back, the word ‘Impostor’ had smacked her on\r\nboth cheeks from her own mouth.\r\n\r\nNow once more they were to run the same round of alarms, undergo the\r\nlove of the place, with perpetual apprehensions of having to leave it:\r\nalarms, throbbing suspicions, like those of old travellers through the\r\nhaunted forest, where whispers have intensity of meaning, and unseeing\r\nwe are seen, and unaware awaited.\r\n\r\nNataly shook the rolls of her thick brown hair from her forehead; she\r\ntook strength from a handsome look of resolution in the glass. She could\r\nalways honestly say, that her courage would not fail him.\r\n\r\nVictor tapped at the door; he stepped into the room, wearing his evening\r\nwhite flower over a more open white waistcoat; and she was composed and\r\nuninquiring. Their Nesta was heard on the descent of the stairs, with a\r\nrattle of Donizetti’s Il segreto to the skylights.\r\n\r\nHe performed his never-omitted lover’s homage.\r\n\r\nNataly enfolded him in a homely smile. ‘A country-house? We go and see\r\nit to-morrow?’\r\n\r\n‘And you’ve been pining for a country home, my dear soul.’\r\n\r\n‘After the summer six weeks, the house in London does not seem a home to\r\nreturn to.’\r\n\r\n‘And next day, Nataly draws five thousand pounds for the first sketch of\r\nthe furniture.’\r\n\r\n‘There is the Creckholt...’ she had a difficulty in saying.\r\n\r\n‘Part of it may do. Lakelands requires--but you will see to-morrow.’\r\n\r\nAfter a close shutting of her eyes, she rejoined: ‘It is not a cottage?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, dear, no: when the Slave of the Lamp takes to building, he does\r\nnot run up cottages. And we did it without magic, all in a year; which\r\nis quite as good as a magical trick in a night.’ He drew her close to\r\nhim. ‘When was it my dear girl guessed me at work?’\r\n\r\n‘It was the other dear girl. Nesta is the guesser.’\r\n\r\n‘You were two best of souls to keep from bothering me; and I might have\r\nhad to fib; and we neither of us like that.’ He noticed a sidling of her\r\nlook. ‘More than the circumstances oblige:--to be frank. But now we\r\ncan speak of them. Wait--and the change comes; and opportunely, I have\r\nfound. It’s true we have waited long; my darling has had her worries.\r\nHowever, it ‘s here at last. Prepare yourself. I speak positively. You\r\nhave to brace up for one sharp twitch--the woman’s portion! as Natata\r\nsays--and it’s over.’ He looked into her eyes for comprehension; and not\r\nfinding inquiry, resumed: ‘Just in time for the entry into Lakelands.\r\nWith the pronouncement of the decree, we present the licence... at an\r\naltar we’ve stood before, in spirit... one of the ladies of your family\r\nto support you:--why not? Not even then?’\r\n\r\n‘No, Victor; they have cast me off.’\r\n\r\n‘Count on my cousins, the Duvidney ladies. Then we can say, that those\r\ntwo good old spinsters are less narrow than the Dreightons. I have to\r\nconfess I rather think I was to blame for leaving Creckholt. Only, if\r\nI see my girl wounded, I hate the place that did the mischief. You and\r\nFredi will clap hands for the country about Lakelands.’\r\n\r\n‘Have you heard from her... of her... is it anything, Victor?’ Nataly\r\nasked him shyly; with not much of hope, but some readiness to be\r\ninflated. The prospect of an entry into the big new house, among a new\r\nsociety, begirt by the old nightmares and fretting devils, drew her into\r\nstaring daylight or furnace-light.\r\n\r\nHe answered: ‘Mrs. Burman has definitely decided. In pity of us?--to be\r\nfree herself?--who can say! She ‘s a woman with a conscience--of a kind:\r\nslow, but it brings her to the point at last. You know her, know her\r\nwell. Fenellan has it from her lawyer--her lawyer! a Mr. Carting; a\r\nthoroughly trustworthy man--’\r\n\r\n‘Fenellan, as a reporter?’\r\n\r\n‘Thoroughly to be trusted on serious matters. I understand that Mrs.\r\nBurman:--her health is awful: yes, yes; poor woman! poor woman! we feel\r\nfor her:--she has come to perceive her duty to those she leaves behind.\r\nConsider: she HAS used the rod. She must be tired out--if human. And she\r\nis. One remembers traits.’\r\n\r\nVictor sketched one or two of the traits allusively to the hearer\r\nacquainted with them. They received strong colouring from midday’s Old\r\nVeuve in his blood. His voice and words had a swing of conviction: they\r\nimparted vinousness to a heart athirst.\r\n\r\nThe histrionic self-deceiver may be a persuasive deceiver of another,\r\nwho is again, though not ignorant of his character, tempted to swallow\r\nthe nostrums which have made so gallant a man of him: his imperceptible\r\nsensible playing of the part, on a substratum of sincereness, induces\r\nfascinatingly to the like performance on our side, that we may be armed\r\nas he is for enjoying the coveted reality through the partial simulation\r\nof possessing it. And this is not a task to us when we have looked our\r\nactor in the face, and seen him bear the look, knowing that he is not\r\nintentionally untruthful; and when we incline to be captivated by his\r\nrare theatrical air of confidence; when it seems as an outside thought\r\nstriking us, that he may not be altogether deceived in the present\r\ninstance; when suddenly an expectation of the thing desired is born and\r\nswims in a credible featureless vagueness on a misty scene: and when we\r\nare being kissed and the blood is warmed. In fine, here as everywhere\r\nalong our history, when the sensations are spirited up to drown the\r\nmind, we become drift-matter of tides, metal to magnets. And if we are\r\nwomen, who commonly allow the lead to men, getting it for themselves\r\nonly by snaky cunning or desperate adventure, credulity--the continued\r\ntrust in the man--is the alternative of despair.\r\n\r\n‘But, Victor, I must ask,’ Nataly said: ‘you have it through Simeon\r\nFenellan; you have not yourself received the letter from her lawyer?’\r\n\r\n‘My knowledge of what she would do near the grave--poor soul, yes! I\r\nshall soon be hearing.’\r\n\r\n‘You do not, propose to enter this place until--until it is over?’\r\n\r\n‘We enter this place, my love, without any sort of ceremony. We live\r\nthere independently, and we can we have quarters there for our friends.\r\nOur one neighbour is London--there! And at Lakelands we are able to\r\nentertain London and wife;--our friends, in short; with some, what\r\nwe have to call, satellites. You inspect the house and grounds\r\nto-morrow--sure to be fair. Put aside all but the pleasant recollections\r\nof Craye and Creckholt. We start on a different footing. Really nothing\r\ncan be simpler. Keeping your town-house, you are now and then in\r\nresidence at Lakelands, where you entertain your set, teach them to feel\r\nthe charm of country life: we have everything about us; could have had\r\nour own milk and cream up to London the last two months. Was it very\r\nnaughty?--I should have exploded my surprise! You will see, you will see\r\nto-morrow.’\r\n\r\nNataly nodded, as required. ‘Good news from the mines?’ she said.\r\n\r\nHe answered: ‘Dartrey is--yes, poor fellow! Dartrey is confident, from\r\nthe yield of stones, that the value of our claim counts in a number\r\nof millions. The same with the gold. But gold-mines are lodgeings, not\r\nhomes.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Victor! if money...! But why did you say “poor fellow” of Dartrey\r\nFenellan?’\r\n\r\n‘You know how he’s...’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes,’ she said hastily. ‘But has that woman been causing fresh\r\nanxiety?’\r\n\r\n‘And Natata’s chief hero on earth is not to be named a poor fellow,’\r\nsaid he, after a negative of the head on a subject they neither of them\r\nliked to touch.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered that Dartrey Fenellan was actually a lucky fellow;\r\nand he would have mentioned the circumstance confided to him by Simeon,\r\nbut for a downright dread of renewing his painful fit of envy. He had\r\nalso another, more distant, very faint idea, that it had better not be\r\nmentioned just yet, for a reason entirely undefined.\r\n\r\nHe consulted his watch. The maid had come in for the robeing of her\r\nmistress. Nataly’s mind had turned to the little country cottage which\r\nwould have given her such great happiness. She raised her eyes to him;\r\nshe could not check their filling; they were like a river carrying\r\nmoonlight on the smooth roll of a fall.\r\n\r\nHe loved the eyes, disliked the water in them. With an impatient,\r\n‘There, there!’ and a smart affectionate look, he retired, thinking in\r\nour old satirical vein of the hopeless endeavour to satisfy a woman’s\r\nmind without the intrusion of hard material statements, facts. Even\r\nthe best of women, even the most beautiful, and in their moments of\r\nsupremest beauty, have this gross ravenousness for facts. You must not\r\nexpect to appease them unless you administer solids. It would almost\r\nappear that man is exclusively imaginative and poetical; and that his\r\nmate, the fair, the graceful, the bewitching, with the sweetest and\r\npurest of natures, cannot help being something of a groveller.\r\n\r\nNataly had likewise her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. BETWEEN A GENERAL MAN OF THIN WORLD AND A PROFESSIONAL.\r\nRather earlier in the afternoon of that day, Simeon Fenellan, thinking\r\nof the many things which are nothing, and so melancholy for lack of\r\namusements properly to follow Old Veuve, that he could ask himself\r\nwhether he had not done a deed of night, to be blinking at his\r\nfellow-men like an owl all mad for the reveller’s hoots and flights\r\nand mice and moony roundels behind his hypocritical judex air of moping\r\ncomposure, chanced on Mr. Carling, the solicitor, where Lincoln’s Inn\r\npumps lawyers into Fleet Street through the drain-pipe of Chancery Lane.\r\nHe was in the state of the wine when a shake will rouse the sluggish\r\nsparkles to foam. Sight of Mrs. Burman’s legal adviser had instantly\r\nthis effect upon him: his bubbling friendliness for Victor Radnor, and\r\nthe desire of the voice in his bosom for ears to hear, combined like the\r\nrush of two waves together, upon which he may be figured as the boat: he\r\ncaught at Mr. Carling’s hand more heartily than their acquaintanceship\r\nquite sanctioned; but his grasp and his look of overflowing were\r\nimmediately privileged; Mr. Carling, enjoying this anecdotal gentleman’s\r\nconversation as he did, liked the warmth, and was flattered during the\r\nsqueeze with a prospect of his wife and friends partaking of the fun\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n‘I was telling my wife yesterday your story of the lady contrabandist: I\r\ndon’t think she has done laughing since,’ Mr. Calling said.\r\n\r\nFenellan fluted: ‘Ah?’ He had scent, in the eulogy of a story grown flat\r\nas Election hats, of a good sort of man in the way of men, a step or two\r\nbehind the man of the world. He expressed profound regret at not having\r\nheard the silvery ring of the lady’s laughter.\r\n\r\nCarling genially conceived a real gratification to be conferred on his\r\nwife. ‘Perhaps you will some day honour us?’\r\n\r\n‘You spread gold-leaf over the days to come, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Now, if I might name the day?’\r\n\r\n‘You lump the gold and make it current coin;--says the blushing bride,\r\nwho ought not to have delivered herself so boldly, but she had forgotten\r\nher bashful part and spoilt the scene, though, luckily for the damsel,\r\nher swain was a lover of nature, and finding her at full charge,\r\nnamed the very next day of the year, and held her to it, like the\r\ncomplimentary tyrant he was.’\r\n\r\n‘To-morrow, then!’ said Carling intrepidly, on a dash of enthusiasm,\r\nthrough a haggard thought of his wife and the cook and the netting of\r\nfriends at short notice. He urged his eagerness to ask whether he might\r\nindeed have the satisfaction of naming to-morrow.\r\n\r\n‘With happiness,’ Fenellan responded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carling was therefore in for it.\r\n\r\n‘To-morrow, half-past seven: as for company to meet you, we will do what\r\nwe can. You go Westward?’\r\n\r\n‘To bed with the sun,’ said the reveller.\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps by Covent Garden? I must give orders there.’\r\n\r\n‘Orders given in Covent Garden, paint a picture for bachelors of the\r\ndomestic Paradise an angel must help them to enter! Ah, dear me! Is\r\nthere anything on earth to compare with the pride of a virtuous life?’\r\n\r\n‘I was married at four and twenty,’ said Carling, as one taking up\r\nthe expository second verse of a poem; plain facts, but weighty and\r\nnecessary: ‘my wife was in her twentieth year: we have five children;\r\ntwo sons, three daughters, one married, with a baby. So we are\r\ngrandfather and mother, and have never regretted the first step, I may\r\nsay for both of us.’\r\n\r\n‘Think of it! Good luck and sagacity joined hands overhead on the day\r\nyou proposed to the lady: and I’d say, that all the credit is with her,\r\nbut that it would seem to be at the expense of her sex.’\r\n\r\n‘She would be the last to wish it, I assure you.’\r\n\r\n‘True of all good women! You encourage me, touching a matter of deep\r\ninterest, not unknown to you. The lady’s warm heart will be with us.\r\nProbably she sees Mrs. Burman?’\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Burman Radnor receives no one.’\r\n\r\nA comic severity in the tone of the correction was deferentially\r\naccepted by Fenellan.\r\n\r\n‘Pardon. She flies her flag, with her captain wanting; and she has,\r\nqueerly, the right. So, then, the worthy dame who receives no one,\r\nmight be treated, it struck us, conversationally, as a respectable\r\nharbour-hulk, with more history than top-honours. But she has the\r\nindubitable legal right to fly them--to proclaim it; for it means little\r\nelse.’\r\n\r\n‘You would have her, if I follow you, divest herself of the name?’\r\n\r\n‘Pin me to no significations, if you please, O shrewdest of the\r\nlegal sort! I have wit enough to escape you there. She is no doubt an\r\nestimable person.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, she is; she is in her way a very good woman.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah. You see, Mr. Carling, I cannot bring myself to rank her beside\r\nanother lady, who has already claimed the title of me; and you will\r\nforgive me if I say, that your word “good” has a look of being stuck\r\nupon the features we know of her, like a coquette’s naughty patch; or\r\nit’s a jewel of an eye in an ebony idol: though I’ve heard tell she\r\nperforms her charities.’\r\n\r\n‘I believe she gives away three parts of her income and that is large.’\r\n\r\n‘Leaving the good lady a fine fat fourth.’\r\n\r\n‘Compare her with other wealthy people.’\r\n\r\n‘And does she outshine the majority still with her personal attractions.\r\n\r\nCarling was instigated by the praise he had bestowed on his wife\r\nto separate himself from a female pretender so ludicrous; he sought\r\nFenellan’s nearest ear, emitting the sound of ‘hum.’\r\n\r\n‘In other respects, unimpeachable!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! quite!’\r\n\r\n‘There was a fishfag of classic Billingsgate, who had broken her\r\nhusband’s nose with a sledgehammer fist, and swore before the\r\nmagistrate, that the man hadn’t a crease to complain of in her\r\ncharacter. We are condemned, Mr. Carling, sometimes to suffer in the\r\nflesh for the assurance we receive of the inviolability of those moral\r\nfortifications.’\r\n\r\n‘Character, yes, valuable--I do wish you had named to-night for doing me\r\nthe honour of dining with me!’ said the lawyer impulsively, in a rapture\r\nof the appetite for anecdotes. ‘I have a ripe Pichon Longueville, ‘65.’\r\n\r\n‘A fine wine. Seductive to hear of. I dine with my friend Victor Radnor.\r\nAnd he knows wine.--There are good women in the world, Mr. Carling,\r\nwhose characters...’\r\n\r\n‘Of course, of course there are; and I could name you some. We\r\nlawyers...!’\r\n\r\n‘You encounter all sorts.’\r\n\r\n‘Between ourselves,’ Carling sank his tones to the indiscriminate, where\r\nit mingled with the roar of London.\r\n\r\n‘You do?’ Fenellan hazarded a guess at having heard enlightened liberal\r\nopinions regarding the sex. ‘Right!’\r\n\r\n‘Many!’\r\n\r\n‘I back you, Mr. Carling.’\r\n\r\nThe lawyer pushed to yet more confidential communication, up to the\r\nverge of the clearly audible: he spoke of examples, experiences.\r\nFenellan backed him further.\r\n\r\n‘Acting on behalf of clients, you understand, Mr. Fenellan.’\r\n\r\n‘Professional, but charitable; I am with you.’\r\n\r\n‘Poor things! we--if we have to condemn--we owe them something.’\r\n\r\n‘A kind word for poor Polly Venus, with all the world against her! She\r\ndoesn’t hear it often.’\r\n\r\n‘A real service,’ Carling’s voice deepened to the legal ‘without\r\nprejudice,’--‘I am bound to say it--a service to Society.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, poor wench! And the kind of reward she gets?’\r\n\r\n‘We can hardly examine... mysterious dispensations... here we are to\r\nmake the best we can of it.’\r\n\r\n‘For the creature Society’s indebted to? True. And am I to think there’s\r\na body of legal gentlemen to join with you, my friend, in founding an\r\nInstitution to distribute funds to preach charity over the country, and\r\nwin compassion for her, as one of the principal persons of her time,\r\nthat Society’s indebted to for whatever it’s indebted for?’\r\n\r\n‘Scarcely that,’ said Carling, contracting.\r\n\r\n‘But you ‘re for great Reforms?’\r\n\r\n‘Gradual.’\r\n\r\n‘Then it’s for Reformatories, mayhap.’\r\n\r\n‘They would hardly be a cure.’\r\n\r\n‘You ‘re in search of a cure?’\r\n\r\n‘It would be a blessed discovery.’\r\n\r\n‘But what’s to become of Society?’\r\n\r\n‘It’s a puzzle to the cleverest.’\r\n\r\n‘All through History, my dear Mr. Carling, we see that.\r\n\r\n‘Establishments must have their sacrifices. Beware of interfering: eh?’\r\n\r\n‘By degrees, we may hope....’\r\n\r\n‘Society prudently shuns the topic; and so ‘ll we. For we might tell of\r\none another, in a fit of distraction, that t’ other one talked of it,\r\nand we should be banished for an offence against propriety. You should\r\nread my friend Durance’s Essay on Society. Lawyers are a buttress of\r\nSociety. But, come: I wager they don’t know what they support until they\r\nread that Essay.’\r\n\r\nCarling had a pleasant sense of escape, in not being personally asked to\r\nread the Essay, and not hearing that a copy of it should be forwarded to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe said: ‘Mr. Radnor is a very old friend?’\r\n\r\n‘Our fathers were friends; they served in the same regiment for years. I\r\nwas in India when Victor Radnor took the fatal!’\r\n\r\n‘Followed by a second, not less...?’\r\n\r\n‘In the interpretation of a rigid morality arming you legal gentlemen to\r\nmake it so!’\r\n\r\n‘The Law must be vindicated.’\r\n\r\n‘The law is a clumsy bludgeon.’\r\n\r\n‘We think it the highest effort of human reason--the practical\r\ninstrument.’\r\n\r\n‘You may compare it to a rustic’s finger on a fiddlestring, for the\r\nmurdered notes you get out of the practical instrument.\r\n\r\n‘I am bound to defend it, clumsy bludgeon or not.’\r\n\r\n‘You are one of the giants to wield it, and feel humanly, when, by\r\nchance, down it comes on the foot an inch off the line.--Here’s a peep\r\nof Old London; if the habit of old was not to wash windows. I like these\r\nold streets!’\r\n\r\n‘Hum,’ Carling hesitated. ‘I can remember when the dirt at the windows\r\nwas appalling.’\r\n\r\n‘Appealing to the same kind of stuff in the passing youngster’s\r\ngreen-scum eye: it was. And there your Law did good work.--You’re for\r\nBordeaux. What is your word on Burgundy?’\r\n\r\n‘Our Falernian!’\r\n\r\n‘Victor Radnor has the oldest in the kingdom. But he will have the best\r\nof everything. A Romanee! A Musigny! Sip, my friend, you embrace the\r\nGoddess of your choice above. You are up beside her at a sniff of that\r\nwine.--And lo, venerable Drury! we duck through the court, reminded a\r\nbit by our feelings of our first love, who hadn’t the cleanest of faces\r\nor nicest of manners, but she takes her station in memory because we\r\nwere boys then, and the golden halo of youth is upon her.’\r\n\r\nCarling, as a man of the world, acquiesced in souvenirs he did not\r\nshare. He said urgently: ‘Understand me; you speak of Mr. Radnor; pray,\r\nbelieve I have the greatest respect for Mr. Radnor’s abilities. He is\r\none of our foremost men... proud of him. Mr. Radnor has genius; I\r\nhave watched him; it is genius; he shows it in all he does; one of the\r\nmemorable men of our times. I can admire him, independent of--well,\r\nmisfortune of that kind... a mistaken early step. Misfortune, it is to\r\nbe named. Between ourselves--we are men of the world--if one could\r\nsee the way! She occasionally... as I have told you. I have ventured\r\nsuggestions. As I have mentioned, I have received an impression...’\r\n\r\n‘But still, Mr. Carling, if the lady doesn’t release him and will keep\r\nhis name, she might stop her cowardly persecutions.’\r\n\r\n‘Can you trace them?’\r\n\r\n‘Undisguised!’\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Burman Radnor is devout. I should not exactly say revengeful.\r\nWe have to discriminate. I gather, that her animus is, in all honesty,\r\ndirected at the--I quote--state of sin. We are mixed, you know.’\r\n\r\nThe Winegod in the blood of Fenellan gave a leap. ‘But, fifty thousand\r\ntimes more mixed, she might any moment stop the state of sin, as she\r\ncalls it, if it pleased her.’\r\n\r\n‘She might try. Our Judges look suspiciously on long delayed actions.\r\nAnd there are, too, women who regard the marriage-tie as indissoluble.\r\nShe has had to combat that scruple.’\r\n\r\n‘Believer in the renewing of the engagement overhead!--well. But put a\r\nby-word to Mother Nature about the state of sin. Where, do you imagine,\r\nshe would lay it? You’ll say, that Nature and Law never agreed. They\r\nought.’\r\n\r\n‘The latter deferring to the former?’\r\n\r\n‘Moulding itself on her swelling proportions. My dear dear sir, the\r\nstate of sin was the continuing to live in defiance of, in contempt of,\r\nin violation of, in the total degradation of, Nature.’\r\n\r\n‘He was under no enforcement to take the oath at the altar.’\r\n\r\n‘He was a small boy tempted by a varnished widow, with pounds of barley\r\nsugar in her pockets;--and she already serving as a test-vessel or\r\nmortar for awful combinations in druggery! Gilt widows are equal to\r\ndecrees of Fate to us young ones. Upon my word, the cleric who unites,\r\nand the Law that sanctions, they’re the criminals. Victor Radnor is the\r\nnoblest of fellows, the very best friend a man can have. I will tell\r\nyou: he saved me, after I left the army, from living on the produce of\r\nmy pen--which means, if there is to be any produce, the prostrating of\r\nyourself to the level of the round middle of the public: saved me from\r\nthat! Yes, Mr. Carling, I have trotted our thoroughfares a poor Polly of\r\nthe pen; and it is owing to Victor Radnor that I can order my thoughts\r\nas an individual man again before I blacken paper. Owing to him, I have\r\na tenderness for mercenaries; having been one of them and knowing how\r\nlittle we can help it. He is an Olympian--who thinks of them below.\r\nThe lady also is an admirable woman at all points. The pair are a mated\r\ncouple, such as you won’t find in ten households over Christendom. Are\r\nyou aware of the story?’\r\n\r\nCarling replied: ‘A story under shadow of the Law, has generally two\r\nvery distinct versions.’\r\n\r\n‘Hear mine.--And, by Jove! a runaway cab. No, all right. But a crazy cab\r\nit is, and fit to do mischief in narrow Drury. Except that it’s sheer\r\nriff-raff here to knock over.’\r\n\r\n‘Hulloa?--come!’ quoth the wary lawyer.\r\n\r\n‘There’s the heart I wanted to rouse to hear me! One may be sure that\r\nthe man for old Burgundy has it big and sound, in spite of his legal\r\npractices; a dear good spherical fellow! Some day, we’ll hope, you will\r\nbe sitting with us over a magnum of Victor Radnor’s Romance Conti aged\r\nthirty-one: a wine, you’ll say at the second glass, High Priest for the\r\ncelebration of the uncommon nuptials between the body and the soul of\r\nman.’\r\n\r\n‘You hit me rightly,’ said Carting, tickled and touched; sensually\r\nexcited by the bouquet of Victor Radnor’s hospitality and companionship,\r\nwhich added flavour to Fenellan’s compliments. These came home to him\r\nthrough his desire to be the ‘good spherical fellow’; for he, like\r\nmodern diplomatists in the track of their eminent Berlinese New Type of\r\nthe time, put on frankness as an armour over wariness, holding craft\r\nin reserve: his aim was at the refreshment of honest fellowship: by\r\nno means to discover that the coupling of his native bias with his\r\nprofessional duty was unprofitable nowadays. Wariness, however, was not\r\nsomnolent, even when he said: ‘You know, I am never the lawyer out of my\r\noffice. Man of the world to men of the world; and I have not lost by\r\nit. I am Mrs. Barman Radnor’s legal adviser: you are Mr. Victor Radnor’s\r\nfriend. They are, as we see them, not on the best of terms. I would\r\nrather--at its lowest, as a matter of business--be known for having\r\nhelped them to some kind of footing than send in a round bill to my\r\nclient--or another. I gain more in the end. Frankly, I mean to prove,\r\nthat it’s a lawyer’s interest to be human.’\r\n\r\n‘Because, now, see!’ said Fenellan, ‘here’s the case. Miss Natalia\r\nDreighton, of a good Yorkshire family--a large one, reads an\r\nadvertisement for the post of companion to a lady, and answers it, and\r\nengages herself, previous to the appearance of the young husband. Miss\r\nDreighton is one of the finest young women alive. She has a glorious\r\ncontralto voice. Victor and she are encouraged by Mrs. Barman to sing\r\nduets together. Well?\r\n\r\nWhy, Euclid would have theorem’d it out for you at a glance at the trio.\r\nYou have only to look on them, you chatter out your three Acts of a\r\nDrama without a stop. If Mrs. Barman cares to practise charity, she has\r\nonly to hold in her Fury-forked tongue, or her Jarniman I think ‘s the\r\nname.’\r\n\r\nCarting shrugged.\r\n\r\n‘Let her keep from striking, if she’s Christian,’ pursued Fenetlan,\r\n‘and if kind let her resume the name of her first lord, who did a better\r\nthing for himself than for her, when he shook off his bars of bullion,\r\nto rise the lighter, and left a wretched female soul below, with the\r\ndevil’s own testimony to her attractions--thousands in the Funds, houses\r\nin the City. She threw the young couple together. And my friend Victor\r\nRadnor is of a particularly inflammable nature. Imagine one of us in\r\nsuch a situation, Mr. Carting!’\r\n\r\n‘Trying!’ said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n‘The dear fellow was as nigh death as a man can be and know the\r\nsweetness of a woman’s call to him to live. And here’s London’s garden\r\nof pines, bananas, oranges; all the droppings of the Hesperides here! We\r\ndon’t reflect on it, Mr. Carling.’\r\n\r\n‘Not enough, not enough.’\r\n\r\n‘I feel such a spout of platitudes that I could out With a Leading\r\nArticle on a sheet of paper on your back while you’re bending over the\r\nbaskets. I seem to have got circularly round again to Eden when I enter\r\na garden. Only, here we have to pay for the fruits we pluck. Well, and\r\njust the same there; and no end to the payment either. We’re always\r\npaying! By the way, Mrs. Victor Radnor’s dinner-table’s a spectacle. Her\r\ntaste in flowers equals her lord’s in wine. But age improves the wine\r\nand spoils the flowers, you’ll say. Maybe you’re for arguing that lovely\r\nwomen show us more of the flower than the grape, in relation to the\r\ncourse of time. I pray you not to forget the terrible intoxicant she\r\nis. We reconcile it, Mr. Carling, with the notion that the grape’s\r\nher spirit, the flower her body. Or is it the reverse? Perhaps an\r\nintertwining. But look upon bouquets and clusters, and the idea of\r\nwoman springs up at once, proving she’s composed of them. I was about\r\nto remark, that with deference to the influence of Mrs. Burman’s\r\nlegal adviser, an impenitent or penitent sinner’s pastor, the Reverend\r\ngentleman ministering to her spiritual needs, would presumptively\r\nexercise it, in this instance, in a superior degree.’\r\n\r\nCarling murmured: ‘The Rev. Groseman Buttermore’; and did so for\r\nsomething of a cover, to continue a run of internal reflections: as,\r\nthat he was assuredly listening to vinous talk in the streets by day;\r\nwhich impression placed him on a decorous platform above the\r\namusing gentleman; to whom, however, he grew cordial, in recognizing\r\nconsequently, that his exuberant flow could hardly be a mask; and that\r\nan indication here and there of a trap in his talk, must have been due\r\nrather to excess of wariness, habitual in the mind of a long-headed man,\r\nwhose incorrigibly impulsive fits had necessarily to be rectified by a\r\nvigilant dexterity.\r\n\r\n‘Buttermore!’ ejaculated Fenellan: ‘Groseman Buttermore! Mrs.\r\nVictor’s Father Confessor is the Rev. Septimus Barmby. Groseman\r\nButtermore--Septimus Barmby. Is there anything in names? Truly, unless\r\nthese clerical gentlemen take them up at the crossing of the roads\r\nlong after birth, the names would appear the active parts of them,\r\nand themselves mere marching supports, like the bearers of street\r\nplacard-advertisements. Now, I know a Septimus Barmby, and you a\r\nGroseman Buttermore, and beyond the fact that Reverend starts up before\r\ntheir names without mention, I wager it’s about all we do know of them.\r\nThey’re Society’s trusty rock-limpets, no doubt.’\r\n\r\n‘My respect for the cloth is extreme.’ Carling’s short cough prepared\r\nthe way for deductions. ‘Between ourselves, they are men of the world.’\r\n\r\nFenellan eyed benevolently the worthy attorney, whose innermost imp\r\nburst out periodically, like a Dutch clocksentry, to trot on his own\r\nsmall grounds for thinking himself of the community of the man of\r\nthe world. ‘You lawyers dress in another closet,’ he said. ‘The Rev.\r\nGroseman has the ear of the lady?’\r\n\r\n‘He has:--one ear.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah? She has the other open for a man of the world, perhaps.’\r\n\r\n‘Listens to him, listens to me, listens to Jarniman; and we neither of\r\nus guide her. She’s very curious--a study. You think you know her--next\r\nday she has eluded you. She’s emotional, she’s hard; she’s a woman,\r\nshe’s a stone. Anything you like; but don’t count on her. And another\r\nthing--I’m bound to say it of myself,’ Carling claimed close hearing of\r\nFenellan over a shelf of saladstuff, ‘no one who comes near her has any\r\nreal weight with her in this matter.’\r\n\r\n‘Probably you mix cream in your salad of the vinegar and oil,’ said\r\nFenellan. ‘Try jelly of mutton.’--‘You give me a new idea. Latterly,\r\nfond as I am of salads, I’ve had rueful qualms. We’ll try it.’\r\n\r\n‘You should dine with Victor Radnor.’\r\n\r\n‘French cook, of course!’\r\n\r\n‘Cordon bleu.’\r\n\r\n‘I like to be sure of my cutlet.’\r\n\r\n‘I like to be sure of a tastiness in my vegetables.’\r\n\r\n‘And good sauces!’\r\n\r\n‘And pretty pastry. I said, Cordon bleu. The miracle is, it ‘s a woman\r\nthat Victor Radnor has trained: French, but a woman; devoted to him, as\r\nall who serve him are. Do I say “but” a woman? There’s not a Frenchman\r\nalive to match her. Vatel awaits her in Paradise with his arms extended;\r\nand may he wait long!’\r\n\r\nCarling indulged his passion for the genuine by letting a flutter of\r\nreal envy be seen. ‘My wife would like to meet such a Frenchwoman. It\r\nmust be a privilege to dine with him--to know him. I know what he has\r\ndone for English Commerce, and to build a colossal fortune: genius, as I\r\nsaid: and his donations to Institutions. Odd, to read his name and Mrs.\r\nBurman Radnor’s at separate places in the lists! Well, we’ll hope. It’s\r\na case for a compromise of sentiments and claims.’\r\n\r\n‘A friend of mine, spiced with cynic, declares that there’s always an\r\namicable way out of a dissension, if we get rid of Lupus and Vulpus.’\r\n\r\nCarling spied for a trap in the citation of Lupus and Vulpus; he\r\nsaw none, and named the square of his residence on the great Russell\r\nproperty, and the number of the house, the hour of dinner next day.\r\nHe then hung silent, breaking the pause with his hand out and a sharp\r\n‘Well?’ that rattled a whirligig sound in his head upward. His leave of\r\npeople was taken in this laughing falsetto, as of one affected by the\r\ncurious end things come to.\r\n\r\nFenellan thought of him for a moment or two, that he was a better than\r\nthe common kind of lawyer; who doubtless knew as much of the wrong side\r\nof the world as lawyers do, and held his knowledge for the being a man\r\nof the world:--as all do, that have not Alpine heights in the mind to\r\nmount for a look out over their own and the world’s pedestrian tracks.\r\nI could spot the lawyer in your composition, my friend, to the exclusion\r\nof the man he mused. But you’re right in what you mean to say of\r\nyourself: you’re a good fellow, for a lawyer, and together we may manage\r\nsomehow to score a point of service to Victor Radnor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. SOME FAMILIAR GUESTS\r\n\r\nNesta read her mother’s face when Mrs. Victor entered the drawing-room\r\nto receive the guests. She saw a smooth fair surface, of the kind as\r\nmuch required by her father’s eyes as innocuous air by his nostrils: and\r\nit was honest skin, not the deceptive feminine veiling, to make a dear\r\nman happy over his volcano. Mrs. Victor was to meet the friends with\r\nwhom her feelings were at home, among whom her musical gifts gave her\r\nstation: they liked her for herself; they helped her to feel at home\r\nwith herself and be herself: a rarer condition with us all than is\r\ngenerally supposed. So she could determine to be cheerful in the\r\nanticipation of an evening that would at least be restful to the outworn\r\nsentinel nerve of her heart, which was perpetually alert and signalling\r\nto the great organ; often colouring the shows and seems of adverse\r\nthings for an apeing of reality with too cruel a resemblance. One of the\r\nscraps of practical wisdom gained by hardened sufferers is, to keep from\r\nspying at horizons when they drop into a pleasant dingle. Such is the\r\ncomfort of it, that we can dream, and lull our fears, and half think\r\nwhat we wish: and it is a heavenly truce with the fretful mind divided\r\nfrom our wishes.\r\n\r\nNesta wondered at her mother’s complacent questions concerning this\r\nLakelands: the house, the county, the kind of people about, the features\r\nof the country. Physically unable herself to be regretful under a burden\r\nthree parts enrapturing her, the girl expected her mother to display\r\na shadowy vexation, with a proud word or two, that would summon\r\nher thrilling sympathy in regard to the fourth part: namely, the\r\naristocratic iciness of country magnates, who took them up and cast them\r\noff; as they had done, she thought, at Craye Farm and at Creckholt: she\r\nremembered it, of the latter place, wincingly, insurgently, having loved\r\nthe dear home she had been expelled from by her pride of the frosty\r\nsurrounding people--or no, not all, but some of them. And what had\r\nroused their pride?\r\n\r\nStriking for a reason, her inexperience of our modern England,\r\nsupplemented by readings in the England of a preceding generation, had\r\nhit on her father’s profession of merchant. It accounted to her for the\r\nbehaviour of the haughty territorial and titled families. But certain\r\nof the minor titles headed City Firms, she had heard; certain of the\r\nfamilies were avowedly commercial. ‘They follow suit,’ her father\r\nsaid at Creckholt, after he had found her mother weeping, and decided\r\ninstantly to quit and fly once more. But if they followed suit in such\r\na way, then Mr. Durance must be right when he called the social English\r\nthe most sheepy of sheep:--and Nesta could not consent to the cruel\r\nverdict, she adored her compatriots. Incongruities were pacified for her\r\nby the suggestion of her quick wits, that her father, besides being a\r\nmerchant, was a successful speculator; and perhaps the speculator is not\r\nliked by merchants; or they were jealous of him; or they did not like\r\nhis being both.\r\n\r\nShe pardoned them with some tenderness, on a suspicion that a quaint old\r\nhigh-frilled bleached and puckered Puritanical rectitude (her thoughts\r\nrose in pictures) possibly condemned the speculator as a description\r\nof gambler. An erratic severity in ethics is easily overlooked by the\r\nenthusiast for things old English. She was consciously ahead of them in\r\nthe knowledge that her father had been, without the taint of gambling,\r\na beneficent speculator. The Montgomery colony in South Africa, and his\r\ndealings with the natives in India, and his Railways in South America,\r\nhis establishment of Insurance Offices, which were Savings Banks, and\r\nthe Stores for the dispensing of sound goods to the poor, attested it. O\r\nand he was hospitable, the kindest, helpfullest of friends, the dearest,\r\nthe very brightest of parents: he was his girl’s playmate. She could be\r\ncritic of him, for an induction to the loving of him more justly: yet\r\nif he had an excessive desire to win the esteem of people, as these keen\r\nyoung optics perceived in him, he strove to deserve it; and no one could\r\naccuse him of laying stress on the benefits he conferred. Designedly,\r\nfrigidly to wound a man so benevolent, appeared to her as an\r\nincomprehensible baseness. The dropping of acquaintanceship with him,\r\nafter the taste of its privileges, she ascribed, in the void of any\r\nbetter elucidation, to a mania of aristocratic conceit. It drove her,\r\ndespite her youthful contempt of politics, into a Radicalism that could\r\nfind food in the epigrams of Mr. Colney Durance, even when they passed\r\nher understanding; or when he was not too distinctly seen by her to be\r\nshooting at all the parties of her beloved England, beneath the wicked\r\nsemblance of shielding each by turns.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman introduced to the Radnor Concert-parties by Lady\r\nGrace Halley as the Hon. Dudley Sowerby, had to bear the sins of his\r\nclass. Though he was tall, straight-featured, correct in costume,\r\nappearance, deportment, second son of a religious earl and no scandal\r\nto the parentage, he was less noticed by Nesta than the elderly and the\r\ncommoners. Her father accused her of snubbing him. She reproduced her\r\nfamous copy of the sugared acid of Mr. Dudley Sowerby’s closed mouth: a\r\nsort of sneer in meekness, as of humility under legitimate compulsion;\r\ndeploring Christianly a pride of race that stamped it for this cowled\r\nexhibition: the wonderful mimicry was a flash thrown out by a born\r\nmistress of the art, and her mother was constrained to laugh, and so\r\nwas her father; but he wilfully denied the likeness. He charged her with\r\nencouraging Colney Durance to drag forth the sprig of nobility, in the\r\nnakedness of evicted shell-fish, on themes of the peril to England,\r\npossibly ruin, through the loss of that ruling initiative formerly\r\npossessed, in the days of our glory, by the titular nobles of the land.\r\nColney spoke it effectively, and the Hon. Dudley’s expressive lineaments\r\nshowed print of the heaving word Alas, as when a target is penetrated,\r\ncentrally. And he was not a particularly dull fellow ‘for his class and\r\ncountry,’ Colney admitted; adding: ‘I hit his thought and out he came.’\r\nOne has, reluctantly with Victor Radnor, to grant, that when a man’s\r\ntopmost unspoken thought is hit, he must be sharp on his guard to keep\r\nfrom coming out:--we have won a right to him.\r\n\r\n‘Only, it’s too bad; it ‘s a breach of hospitality,’ Victor said, both\r\nto Nesta and to Nataly, alluding to several instances of Colney’s ironic\r\nhandling of their guests, especially of this one, whom Nesta would\r\nattack, and Nataly would not defend.\r\n\r\nThey were alive at a signal to protect the others. Miss Priscilla\r\nGraves, an eater of meat, was ridiculous in her ant’alcoholic\r\nexclusiveness and scorn: Mr. Pempton, a drinker of wine, would laud\r\nextravagantly the more transparent purity of vegetarianism. Dr. Peter\r\nYatt jeered at globules: Dr. John Cormyn mourned over human creatures\r\ntreated as cattle by big doses. The Rev. Septimus Barmby satisfactorily\r\nsmoked: Mr. Peridon traced mortal evil to that act. Dr. Schlesien had\r\nhis German views, Colney Durance his ironic, Fenellan his fanciful and\r\nfree-lance. And here was an optimist, there a pessimist; and the rank\r\nRadical, the rigid Conservative, were not wanting. All of them were\r\npointedly opposed, extraordinarily for so small an assembly: absurdly,\r\nit might be thought: but these provoked a kind warm smile, with the\r\nexclamation: ‘They are dears!’ They were the dearer for their fads and\r\nfoibles.\r\n\r\nMusic harmonized them. Music, strangely, put the spell on Colney\r\nDurance, the sayer of bitter things, manufacturer of prickly balls, in\r\nthe form of Discord’s apples of whom Fenellan remarked, that he took to\r\nhis music like an angry little boy to his barley-sugar, with a growl\r\nand a grunt. All these diverse friends could meet and mix in Victor’s\r\nConcert-room with an easy homely recognition of one another’s musical\r\nqualities, at times enthusiastic; and their natural divergencies and\r\noccasional clashes added a salient tastiness to the group of whom Nesta\r\ncould say: ‘Mama, was there ever such a collection of dear good souls\r\nwith such contrary minds?’ Her mother had the deepest of reasons for\r\nloving them, so as not to wish to see the slightest change in their\r\nminds, that the accustomed features making her nest of homeliness and\r\nreal peace might be retained, with the humour of their funny silly\r\nantagonisms and the subsequent march in concord; excepting solely as\r\nregarded the perverseness of Priscilla Graves in her open contempt\r\nof Mr. Pempton’s innocent two or three wine-glasses. The vegetarian\r\ngentleman’s politeness forbore to direct attention to the gobbets of\r\nmeat Priscilla consumed, though he could express disapproval in general\r\nterms; but he entertained sentiments as warlike to the lady’s habit of\r\n‘drinking the blood of animals.’ The mockery of it was, that Priscilla\r\nliked Mr. Pempton and admired his violoncello-playing, and he was\r\nunreserved in eulogy of her person and her pure soprano tones. Nataly\r\nwas a poetic match-maker. Mr. Peridon was intended for Mademoiselle de\r\nSeilles, Nesta’s young French governess; a lady of a courtly bearing,\r\nwith placid speculation in the eyes she cast on a foreign people, and\r\na voluble muteness shadowing at intervals along the line of her closed\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nThe one person among them a little out of tune with most, was Lady Grace\r\nHalley. Nataly’s provincial gentlewoman’s traditions of the manners\r\nindicating conduct, reproved unwonted licences assumed by Lady Grace;\r\nwho, in allusion to Hymen’s weaving of a cousinship between the earldom\r\nof Southweare and that of Cantor, of which Mr. Sowerby sprang, set her\r\nmouth and fan at work to delineate total distinctions, as it were\r\nfrom the egg to the empyrean. Her stature was rather short, all of it\r\nconversational, at the eyebrows, the shoulders, the finger-tips, the\r\ntwisting shape; a ballerina’s expressiveness; and her tongue dashed\r\nhalf sentences through and among these hieroglyphs, loosely and funnily\r\ncandid. Anybody might hear that she had gone gambling into the City, and\r\nthat she had got herself into a mess, and that by great good luck she\r\nhad come across Victor Radnor, who, with two turns of the wrist, had\r\nplucked her out of the mire, the miraculous man! And she had vowed to\r\nhim, never again to run doing the like without his approval.\r\n\r\nThe cause of her having done it, was related with the accompaniments;\r\nbrows twitching, flitting smiles, shrugs, pouts, shifts of posture: she\r\nwas married to a centaur; out of the saddle a man of wood, ‘an excellent\r\nman.’ For the not colloquial do not commit themselves. But one wants a\r\nlittle animation in a husband. She called on bell-motion of the head\r\nto toll forth the utter nightcap negative. He had not any: out of the\r\nsaddle, he was asleep:--‘next door to the Last Trump,’ Colney Durance\r\nassisted her to describe the soundest of sleep in a husband, after\r\nwooing her to unbosom herself. She was awake to his guileful arts,\r\nand sailed along with him, hailing his phrases, if he shot a good one;\r\nprankishly exposing a flexible nature, that took its holiday thus in a\r\ngrinding world, among maskers, to the horrification of the prim. So to\r\nrefresh ourselves, by having publicly a hip-bath in the truth while we\r\nshock our hearers enough to be discredited for what we reveal, was a\r\ndexterous merry twist, amusing to her; but it was less a cynical malice\r\nthan her nature that she indulged, ‘A woman must have some excitement.’\r\nThe most innocent appeared to her the Stock Exchange. The opinions of\r\nhusbands who are not summoned to pay are hardly important; they vary.\r\n\r\nColney helped her now and then to step the trifle beyond her stride,\r\nbut if he was humorous, she forgave; and if together they appalled the\r\ndecorous, it was great gain. Her supple person, pretty lips, the\r\nstyle she had, gave a pass to the wondrous confidings, which were for\r\nmasculine ears, whatever the sex. Nataly might share in them, but women\r\ndid not lead her to expansiveness; or not the women of the contracted\r\nclass: Miss Graves, Mrs. Cormyn, and others at the Radnor Concerts. She\r\nhad a special consideration for Mademoiselle de Seilles, owing to her\r\nexquisite French, as she said; and she may have liked it, but it was the\r\nyoung Frenchwoman’s air of high breeding that won her esteem. Girls were\r\nspring frosts to her. Fronting Nesta, she put on her noted smile, or\r\nwood-cut of a smile, with its label of indulgence; except when the girl\r\nsang. Music she loved. She said it was the saving of poor Dudley. It\r\ndistinguished him in the group of the noble Evangelical Cantor Family;\r\nand it gave him a subject of assured discourse in company; and oddly,\r\nit contributed to his comelier air. Flute [This would be the German\r\nBlockeflute or our Recorder. D.W.] in hand, his mouth at the blow-stop\r\nwas relieved of its pained updraw by the form for puffing; he preserved\r\na gentlemanly high figure in his exercises on the instrument, out of ken\r\nof all likeness to the urgent insistency of Victor Radnor’s punctuating\r\ntrunk of the puffing frame at almost every bar--an Apollo brilliancy in\r\nenergetic pursuit of the nymph of sweet sound. Too methodical one, too\r\nfiery the other.\r\n\r\nIn duets of Hauptmann’s, with Nesta at the piano, the contrast of dull\r\nsmoothness and overstressed significance was very noticeable beside the\r\nfervent accuracy of her balanced fingering; and as she could also flute,\r\nshe could criticize; though latterly, the flute was boxed away from\r\nlips that had devoted themselves wholly to song: song being one of the\r\ndamsel’s present pressing ambitions. She found nothing to correct in\r\nMr. Sowerby, and her father was open to all the censures; but her father\r\ncould plead vitality, passion. He held his performances cheap after the\r\nvehement display; he was a happy listener, whether to the babble of\r\nhis ‘dear old Corelli,’ or to the majesty of the rattling heavens and\r\nswaying forests of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nHis air of listening was a thing to see; it had a look of disembodiment;\r\nthe sparkle conjured up from deeps, and the life in the sparkle, as of\r\na soul at holiday. Eyes had been given this man to spy the pleasures\r\nand reveal the joy of his pasture on them: gateways to the sunny\r\nwithin, issues to all the outer Edens. Few of us possess that double\r\nsignificance of the pure sparkle. It captivated Lady Grace. She said a\r\nword of it to Fenellan: ‘There is a man who can feel rapture!’ He had\r\nnot to follow the line of her sight: she said so on a previous evening,\r\nin a similar tone; and for a woman to repeat herself, using the very\r\nemphasis, was quaint. She could feel rapture; but her features and limbs\r\nwere in motion to designate it, between simply and wilfully; she had\r\nthe instinct to be dimpling, and would not for a moment control it, and\r\ndelighted in its effectiveness: only when observing that winged sparkle\r\nof eyes did an idea of envy, hardly a consciousness, inform her of being\r\nsurpassed; and it might be in the capacity to feel besides the gift to\r\nexpress. Such a reflection relating to a man, will make women mortally\r\nsensible that they are the feminine of him.\r\n\r\n‘His girl has the look,’ Fenellan said in answer.\r\n\r\nShe cast a glance at Nesta, then at Nataly.\r\n\r\nAnd it was true, that the figure of a mother, not pretending to the\r\nfather’s vividness, eclipsed it somewhat in their child. The mother gave\r\nrichness of tones, hues and voice, and stature likewise, and the thick\r\nbrown locks, which in her own were threads of gold along the brush from\r\nthe temples: she gave the girl a certain degree of the composure of\r\nmanner which Victor could not have bestowed; she gave nothing to clash\r\nwith his genial temper; she might be supposed to have given various\r\nqualities, moral if you like. But vividness was Lady Grace’s admirable\r\nmeteor of the hour: she was unable to perceive, so as to compute, the\r\nvalue of obscurer lights. Under the charm of Nataly’s rich contralto\r\nduring a duet with Priscilla Graves, she gesticulated ecstasies, and\r\nuttered them, and genuinely; and still, when reduced to meditations,\r\nthey would have had no weight, they would hardly have seemed an apology\r\nfor language, beside Victor’s gaze of pleasure in the noble forthroll of\r\nthe notes.\r\n\r\nNataly heard the invitation of the guests of the evening to Lakelands\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nHer anxieties were at once running about to gather provisions for the\r\nbaskets. She spoke of them at night. But Victor had already put the\r\nmatter in the hands of Madame Callet; and all that could be done, would\r\nbe done by Armandine, he knew. ‘If she can’t muster enough at home,\r\nshe’ll be off to her Piccadilly shop by seven A.M. Count on plenty for\r\ntwice the number.’\r\n\r\nNataly was reposing on the thought that they were her friends, when\r\nVictor mentioned his having in the afternoon despatched a note to his\r\nrelatives, the Duvidney ladies, inviting them to join him at the station\r\nto-morrow, for a visit of inspection to the house of his building on his\r\nnew estate. He startled her. The Duvidney ladies were, to his knowledge,\r\nof the order of the fragile minds which hold together by the cement of\r\na common trepidation for the support of things established, and have\r\nit not in them to be able to recognize the unsanctioned. Good women,\r\nunworldly of the world, they were perforce harder than the world, from\r\nbeing narrower and more timorous.\r\n\r\n‘But, Victor, you were sure they would refuse!’\r\n\r\nHe answered: ‘They may have gone back to Tunbridge Wells. By the way,\r\nthey have a society down there I want for Fredi. Sure, do you say, my\r\ndear? Perfectly sure. But the accumulation of invitations and refusals\r\nin the end softens them, you will see. We shall and must have them for\r\nFredi.’\r\n\r\nShe was used to the long reaches of his forecasts, his burning activity\r\non a project; she found it idle to speak her thought, that his ingenuity\r\nwould have been needless in a position dictated by plain prudence, and\r\nso much happier for them.\r\n\r\nThey talked of Mrs. Burman until she had to lift a prayer to be saved\r\nfrom darker thoughts, dreadfully prolific, not to be faced. Part of her\r\nprayer was on behalf of Mrs. Burman, for life to be extended to her, if\r\nthe poor lady clung to life--if it was really humane to wish it for her:\r\nand heaven would know: heaven had mercy on the afflicted.\r\n\r\nNataly heard the snuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer. She had to cease to\r\npray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. AN INSPECTION OF LAKELANDS\r\n\r\nOne may not have an intention to flourish, and may be pardoned for a\r\nsemblance of it, in exclaiming, somewhat royally, as creator and owner\r\nof the place: ‘There you see Lakelands.’\r\n\r\nThe conveyances from the railway station drew up on a rise of road\r\nfronting an undulation, where our modern English architect’s fantasia\r\nin crimson brick swept from central gables to flying wings, over pents,\r\ncrooks, curves, peaks, cowled porches, balconies, recesses, projections,\r\naway to a red village of stables and dependent cottages; harmonious\r\nin irregularity; and coloured homely with the greensward about it, the\r\npines beside it, the clouds above it. Not many palaces would be reckoned\r\nas larger. The folds and swells and stream of the building along the\r\nroll of ground, had an appearance of an enormous banner on the wind.\r\nNataly looked. Her next look was at Colney Durance. She sent the\r\nexpected nods to Victor’s carriage. She would have given the whole\r\nprospect for the covering solitariness of her chamber. A multitude of\r\nclashing sensations, and a throat-thickening hateful to her, compelled\r\nher to summon so as to force herself to feel a groundless anger,\r\ndirected against none, against nothing, perfectly crazy, but her only\r\nresource for keeping down the great wave surgent at her eyes.\r\n\r\nVictor was like a swimmer in morning sea amid the exclamations\r\nencircling him. He led through the straight passage of the galleried\r\nhall, offering two fair landscapes at front door and at back, down to\r\nthe lake, Fredi’s lake; a good oblong of water, notable in a district\r\nnot abounding in the commodity. He would have it a feature of the\r\ndistrict; and it had been deepened and extended; up rose the springs,\r\nmany ran the ducts. Fredi’s pretty little bathshed or bower had a space\r\nof marble on the three-feet shallow it overhung with a shade of carved\r\nwoodwork; it had a diving-board for an eight-feet plunge; a punt and\r\nsmall row-boat of elegant build hard by. Green ran the banks about, and\r\na beechwood fringed with birches curtained the Northward length: morning\r\nsun and evening had a fair face of water to paint. Saw man ever the like\r\nfor pleasing a poetical damsel? So was Miss Fredi, the coldest of the\r\nparty hitherto, and dreaming a preference of ‘old places’ like Creckholt\r\nand Craye Farm, ‘captured to be enraptured,’ quite according to man’s\r\nideal of his beneficence to the sex. She pressed the hand of her young\r\nFrench governess, Louise de Seilles. As in everything he did for his\r\ngirl, Victor pointed boastfully to his forethought of her convenience\r\nand her tastes: the pine-panels of the interior, the shelves for her\r\nbooks, pegs to hang her favourite drawings, and the couch-bunk under a\r\nwindow to conceal the summerly recliner while throwing full light on\r\nher book; and the hearth-square for logs, when she wanted fire: because\r\nFredi bathed in any weather: the oaken towel-coffer; the wood-carvings\r\nof doves, tits, fishes; the rod for the flowered silken hangings she was\r\nto choose, and have shy odalisque peeps of sunny water from her couch.\r\n\r\n‘Fredi’s Naiad retreat, when she wishes to escape Herr Strauscher or\r\nSignor Ruderi,’ said Victor, having his grateful girl warm in an arm;\r\n‘and if they head after her into the water, I back her to leave them\r\npuffing; she’s a dolphin. That water has three springs and gets all the\r\ndrainage of the upland round us. I chose the place chiefly on account of\r\nit and the pines. I do love pines!’\r\n\r\n‘But, excellent man! what do you not love?’ said Lady Grace, with the\r\ntimely hit upon the obvious, which rings.\r\n\r\n‘It saves him from accumulation of tissue,’ said Colney.\r\n\r\n‘What does?’ was eagerly asked by the wife of the homoeopathic Dr. John\r\nCormyn, a sentimental lady beset with fears of stoutness.\r\n\r\nVictor cried: ‘Tush; don’t listen to Colney, pray.’\r\n\r\nBut she heard Colney speak of a positive remedy; more immediately\r\neffective than an abjuration of potatoes and sugar. She was obliged by\r\nher malady to listen, although detesting the irreverent ruthless man,\r\nwho could direct expanding frames, in a serious tone, to love; love\r\neverybody, everything; violently and universally love; and so without\r\nintermission pay out the fat created by a rapid assimilation of\r\nnutriment. Obeseness is the most sensitive of our ailments: probably as\r\nbeing aware, that its legitimate appeal to pathos is ever smothered in\r\nits pudding-bed of the grotesque. She was pained, and showed it, and\r\nwas ashamed of herself for showing it; and that very nearly fetched the\r\ntear.\r\n\r\n‘Our host is an instance in proof,’ Colney said. He waved hand at the\r\nhouse. His meaning was hidden; evidently he wanted victims. Sight\r\nof Lakelands had gripped him with the fell satiric itch; and it is a\r\npassion to sting and tear, on rational grounds. His face meanwhile,\r\nwhich had points of the handsome, signified a smile asleep, as if\r\nbeneath a cloth. Only those who knew him well were aware of the\r\nclaw-like alertness under the droop of eyelids.\r\n\r\nAdmiration was the common note, in the various keys. The station\r\nselected for the South-eastward aspect of the dark-red gabled pile on\r\nits white shell-terrace, backed by a plantation of tall pines, a mounded\r\nand full-plumed company, above the left wing, was admired, in files and\r\nin volleys. Marvellous, effectively miraculous, was the tale of the vow\r\nto have the great edifice finished within one year: and the strike of\r\nworkmen, and the friendly colloquy with them, the good reasoning, the\r\nunanimous return to duty; and the doubling, the trebling of the number\r\nof them; and the most glorious of sights--O the grand old English\r\nworking with a will! as Englishmen do when they come at last to heat;\r\nand they conquer, there is then nothing that they cannot conquer. So\r\nthe conqueror said.--And admirable were the conservatories running three\r\nlong lines, one from the drawing-room, to a central dome for tropical\r\ngrowths. And the parterres were admired; also the newly-planted Irish\r\njunipers bounding the West-walk; and the three tiers of stately descent\r\nfrom the three green terrace banks to the grassy slopes over the lake.\r\nAgain the lake was admired, the house admired. Admiration was evoked for\r\ngreat orchid-houses ‘over yonder,’ soon to be set up.\r\n\r\nOff we go to the kitchen-garden. There the admiration is genial,\r\npractical. We admire the extent of the beds marked out for asparagus,\r\nand the French disposition of the planting at wide intervals; and the\r\nFrench system of training peach, pear, and plum trees on the walls to\r\nwin length and catch sun, we much admire. We admire the gardener. We are\r\ninduced temporarily to admire the French people. They are sagacious\r\nin fruit-gardens. They have not the English Constitution, you think\r\nrightly; but in fruit-gardens they grow for fruit, and not, as Victor\r\nquotes a friend, for wood, which the valiant English achieve. We hear\r\nand we see examples of sagacity; and we are further brought round to\r\nthe old confession, that we cannot cook; Colney Durance has us there; we\r\nhave not studied herbs and savours; and so we are shocked backward\r\nstep by step until we retreat precipitately into the nooks where waxen\r\ntapers, carefully tended by writers on the Press, light-up mysterious\r\nimages of our national selves for admiration. Something surely we do, or\r\nwe should not be where we are. But what is it we do (excepting cricket,\r\nof course) which others cannot do? Colney asks; and he excludes cricket\r\nand football.\r\n\r\nAn acutely satiric man in an English circle, that does not resort to the\r\nfist for a reply to him, may almost satiate the excessive fury roused\r\nin his mind by an illogical people of a provocative prosperity, mainly\r\ntongueless or of leaden tongue above the pressure of their necessities,\r\nas he takes them to be. They give him so many opportunities. They are\r\nangry and helpless as the log hissing to the saw. Their instinct to make\r\nuse of the downright in retort, restrained as it is by a buttoned coat\r\nof civilization, is amusing, inviting. Colney Durance allured them to\r\nthe quag’s edge and plunged them in it, to writhe patriotically; and\r\nalthough it may be said, that they felt their situation less than did he\r\nthe venom they sprang in his blood, he was cruel; he caused discomfort.\r\nBut these good friends about him stood for the country, an illogical\r\ncountry; and as he could not well attack his host Victor Radnor, an\r\nirrational man, he selected the abstract entity for the discharge of his\r\nhonest spite.\r\n\r\nThe irrational friend was deeper at the source of his irritation than\r\nthe illogical old motherland. This house of Lakelands, the senselessness\r\nof his friend in building it and designing to live in it, after\r\nexperiences of an incapacity to stand in a serene contention with the\r\nworld he challenged, excited Colney’s wasp. He was punished, half way\r\nto frenzy behind his placable demeanour, by having Dr. Schlesien for\r\nchorus. And here again, it was the unbefitting, not the person, which\r\nstirred his wrath. A German on English soil should remember the dues of\r\na guest. At the same time, Colney said things to snare the acclamation\r\nof an observant gentleman of that race, who is no longer in his first\r\nenthusiasm for English beef and the complexion of the women. ‘Ah, ya,\r\nit is true, what you say: “The English grow as fast as odders, but\r\nthey grow to corns instead of brains.” They are Bull. Quaat true.’ He\r\nbellowed on a laugh the last half of the quotation.\r\n\r\nColney marked him. His encounters with Fenellan were enlivening\r\nengagements and left no malice; only a regret, when the fencing passed\r\nhis guard, that Fenellan should prefer to flash for the minute. He would\r\nhave met a pert defender of England, in the person of Miss Priscilla\r\nGraves, if she had not been occupied with observation of the bearing\r\nof Lady Grace Halley toward Mr. Victor Radnor; which displeased her on\r\nbehalf of Mrs. Victor; she was besides hostile by race and class to an\r\naristocratic assumption of licence. Sparing Colney, she with some scorn\r\ncondemned Mr. Pempton for allowing his country to be ridiculed without\r\na word. Mr. Pempton believed that the Vegetarian movement was\r\nmore progressive in England than in other lands, but he was at the\r\ndisadvantage with the fair Priscilla, that eulogy of his compatriots\r\non this account would win her coldest approval. ‘Satire was never an\r\nargument,’ he said, too evasively.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Septimus Barmby received the meed of her smile, for saying in\r\nhis many-fathom bass, with an eye on Victor: ‘At least we may boast of\r\nbreeding men, who are leaders of men.’\r\n\r\nThe announcement of luncheon, by Victor’s butler Arlington, opportunely\r\nfollowed and freighted the remark with a happy recognition of that which\r\ncomes to us from the hands of conquerors. Dr. Schlesien himself, no\r\nantagonist to England, but like Colney Durance, a critic, speculated in\r\nview of the spread of pic-nic provision beneath the great glass dome, as\r\nto whether it might be, that these English were on another start out of\r\nthe dust in vigorous commercial enterprise, under leadership of one of\r\ntheir chance masterly minds-merchant, in this instance: and be debated\r\nwithin, whether Genius, occasionally developed in a surprising superior\r\nmanner by these haphazard English, may not sometimes wrest the prize\r\nfrom Method; albeit we count for the long run, that Method has assurance\r\nof success, however late in the race to set forth.\r\n\r\nLuncheon was a merry meal, with Victor and Nataly for host and hostess;\r\nFenellan, Colney Durance, and Lady Grace Halley for the talkers. A gusty\r\nbosom of sleet overhung the dome, rattled on it, and rolling Westward,\r\nbecame a radiant mountain-land, partly worthy of Victor’s phrase: ‘A\r\nrange of Swiss Alps in air.’\r\n\r\n‘With periwigs Louis Quatorze for peaks,’ Colney added.\r\n\r\nAnd Fenellan improved on him: ‘Or a magnified Bench of Judges at the\r\ntrial of your caerulean Phryne.’\r\n\r\nThe strip of white cloud flew on a whirl from the blue, to confirm it.\r\n\r\nBut Victor and Lady Grace rejected any play of conceits upon nature.\r\nViolent and horrid interventions of the counterfeit, such mad similes\r\nappeared to them, when pure coin was offered. They loathed the Rev.\r\nSeptimus Barmby for proclaiming, that he had seen ‘Chapters of Hebrew\r\nHistory in the grouping of clouds.’\r\n\r\nHis gaze was any one of the Chapters upon Nesta. The clerical\r\ngentleman’s voice was of a depth to claim for it the profoundest which\r\ncan be thought or uttered; and Nesta’s tender youth had taken so strong\r\nan impression of sacredness from what Fenellan called ‘his chafer\r\ntones,’ that her looks were often given him in gratitude, for the mere\r\nsound. Nataly also had her sense of safety in acquiescing to such a\r\nvoice coming from such a garb. Consequently, whenever Fenellan and\r\nColney were at him, drawing him this way and that for utterances\r\ncathedral in sentiment and sonorousness, these ladies shed protecting\r\nbeams; insomuch that he was inspired to the agreeable conceptions\r\nwhereof frequently rash projects are an issue.\r\n\r\nTouching the neighbours of Lakelands, they were principally enriched\r\nmerchants, it appeared; a snippet or two of the fringe of aristocracy\r\nlay here and there among them; and one racy-of-the-soil old son of\r\nThames, having the manners proper to last century’s yeoman. Mr. Pempton\r\nknew something of this quaint Squire of Hefferstone, Beaves Urmsing by\r\nname; a ruddy man, right heartily Saxon; a still glowing brand amid the\r\nashes of the Heptarchy hearthstone; who had a song, The Marigolds, which\r\nhe would troll out for you anywhere, on any occasion. To have so near\r\nto the metropolis one from the centre of the venerable rotundity of\r\nthe country, was rare. Victor exclaimed ‘Come!’ in ravishment over the\r\npicturesqueness of a neighbour carrying imagination away to the founts\r\nof England; and his look at Nataly proposed. Her countenance was\r\ninapprehensive. He perceived resistance, and said: ‘I have met two\r\nor three of them in the train: agreeable men: Gladding, the banker; a\r\nGeneral Fanning; that man Blathenoy, great billbroker. But the fact\r\nis, close on London, we’re independent of neighbours; we mean to be.\r\nLakelands and London practically join.’\r\n\r\n‘The mother city becoming the suburb,’ murmured Colney, in report of the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n‘You must expect to be invaded, sir,’ said Mr. Sowerby; and Victor\r\nshrugged: ‘We are pretty safe.’\r\n\r\n‘The lock of a door seems a potent security until some one outside is\r\nheard fingering the handle nigh midnight,’ Fenellan threw out his airy\r\nnothing of a remark.\r\n\r\nIt struck on Nataly’s heart. ‘So you will not let us be lonely here,’\r\nshe said to her guests.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Septimus Barmby was mouthpiece for congregations. Sound of a\r\nsubterranean roar, with a blast at the orifice, informed her of their\r\n‘very deep happiness in the privilege.’\r\n\r\nHe comforted her. Nesta smiled on him thankfully.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t imagine, Mrs. Victor, that you can be shut off from neighbours,\r\nin a house like this; and they have a claim,’ said Lady Grace, quitting\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nFenellan and Colney thought so:\r\n\r\n‘Like mice at a cupboard.’\r\n\r\n‘Beetles in a kitchen.’\r\n\r\n‘No, no-no, no!’ Victor shook head, pitiful over the good people likened\r\nto things unclean, and royally upraising them: in doing which, he\r\nscattered to vapour the leaden incubi they had been upon his flatter\r\nmoods of late. ‘No, but it’s a rapture to breathe the air here!’ His\r\nlifted chest and nostrils were for the encouragement of Nataly to soar\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nShe summoned her smile and nodded.\r\n\r\nHe spoke aside to Lady Grace: ‘The dear soul wants time to compose\r\nherself after a grand surprise.’\r\n\r\nShe replied: ‘I think I could soon be reconciled. How much land?’\r\n\r\n‘In treaty for some hundred and eighty or ninety acres... in all\r\nat present three hundred and seventy, including plantations, lake,\r\nouthouses.’\r\n\r\n‘Large enough; land paying as it does--that is, not paying. We shall be\r\nhaving to gamble in the City systematically for subsistence.’\r\n\r\n‘You will not so much as jest on the subject.’\r\n\r\nComing from such a man, that was clear sky thunder. The lady played\r\nit off in a shadowy pout and shrug while taking a stamp of his\r\nmasterfulness, not so volatile.\r\n\r\nShe said to Nataly: ‘Our place in Worcestershire is about half the size,\r\nif as much. Large enough when we’re not crowded out with gout and can\r\nopen to no one. Some day you will visit us, I hope.’\r\n\r\n‘You we count on here, Lady Grace.’\r\n\r\nIt was an over-accentuated response; unusual with this well-bred woman;\r\nand a bit of speech that does not flow, causes us to speculate. The lady\r\nresumed: ‘I value the favour. We’re in a horsey-doggy-foxy circle down\r\nthere. We want enlivening. If we had your set of musicians and talkers!’\r\n\r\nNataly smiled in vacuous kindness, at a loss for the retort of a\r\ncompliment to a person she measured. Lady Grace also was an amiable\r\nhostile reviewer. Each could see, to have cited in the other, defects\r\ncommon to the lower species of the race, admitting a superior personal\r\nquality or two; which might be pleaded in extenuation; and if the\r\napology proved too effective, could be dispersed by insistence upon it,\r\nunder an implied appeal to benevolence. When we have not a liking for\r\nthe creature whom we have no plain cause to dislike, we are minutely\r\njust.\r\n\r\nDuring the admiratory stroll along the ground-floor rooms, Colney\r\nDurance found himself beside Dr. Schlesien; the latter smoking,\r\nstriding, emphasizing, but bearable, as the one of the party who was\r\nnot perpetually at the gape in laudation. Colney was heard to say:\r\n‘No doubt: the German is the race the least mixed in Europe: it might\r\nchallenge aboriginals for that. Oddly, it has invented the Cyclopaedia\r\nfor knowledge, the sausage for nutrition! How would you explain it?’\r\n\r\nDr. Schlesien replied with an Atlas shrug under fleabite to the\r\ninsensately infantile interrogation.\r\n\r\nHe in turn was presently heard.\r\n\r\n‘But, my good sir! you quote me your English Latin. I must beg of you\r\nyou write it down. It is orally incomprehensible to Continentals.’\r\n\r\n‘We are Islanders!’ Colney shrugged in languishment.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, you do great things...’ Dr. Schlesien rejoined in kindness, making\r\nhis voice a musical intimation of the smallness of the things.\r\n\r\n‘We build great houses, to employ our bricks’\r\n\r\n‘No, Colney, to live in,’ said Victor.\r\n\r\n‘Scarcely long enough to warm them.’\r\n\r\n‘What do you... fiddle!’\r\n\r\n‘They are not Hohenzollerns!’\r\n\r\n‘It is true,’ Dr. Schlesien called. ‘No, but you learn discipline; you\r\nbuild. I say wid you, not Hohenzollerns you build! But you shall look\r\nabove: Eyes up. Ire necesse est. Good, but mount; you come to something.\r\nHave ideas.’\r\n\r\n‘Good, but when do we reach your level?’\r\n\r\n‘Sir, I do not say more than that we do not want instruction from\r\nforeigners.’\r\n\r\n‘Pupil to paedagogue indeed. You have the wreath in Music, in\r\nJurisprudence, Chemistry, Scholarship, Beer, Arms, Manners.’\r\n\r\nDr. Schlesien puffed a tempest of tobacco and strode.\r\n\r\n‘He is chiselling for wit in the Teutonic block,’ Colney said, falling\r\nback to Fenellan.\r\n\r\nFenellan observed: ‘You might have credited him with the finished\r\nsculpture.’\r\n\r\n‘They’re ahead of us in sticking at the charge of wit.’\r\n\r\n‘They’ve a widening of their swallow since Versailles.’\r\n\r\n‘Manners?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, that’s a tight cravat for the Teutonic thrapple! But he’s off by\r\nhimself to loosen it.’\r\n\r\nVictor came on the couple testily. ‘What are you two concocting! I\r\nsay, do keep the peace, please. An excellent good fellow; better up in\r\npolitics than any man I know; understands music; means well, you can\r\nsee. You two hate a man at all serious. And he doesn’t bore with his\r\nknowledge. A scholar too.’\r\n\r\n‘If he’ll bring us the atmosphere of the groves of Academe, he may swing\r\nhis ferule pickled in himself, and welcome,’ said Fenellan.\r\n\r\n‘Yes!’ Victor nodded at a recognized antagonism in Fenellan; ‘but\r\nColney’s always lifting the Germans high above us.’\r\n\r\n‘It’s to exercise his muscles.’\r\n\r\nVictor headed to the other apartments, thinking that the Rev. Septimus\r\nand young Sowerby, Old England herself, were spared by the diversion\r\nof these light skirmishing shots from their accustomed victims to the\r\n‘masculine people of our time. His friends would want a drilling to be\r\nof aid to him in his campaign to come. For it was one, and a great one.\r\nHe remembered his complete perception of the plan, all the elements of\r\nit, the forward whirling of it, just before the fall on London Bridge.\r\nThe greatness of his enterprise laid such hold of him that the smallest\r\nof obstacles had a villanous aspect; and when, as anticipated, Colney\r\nand Fenellan were sultry flies for whomsoever they could fret, he was\r\nblind to the reading of absurdities which caused Fredi’s eyes to stream\r\nand Lady Grace beside him to stand awhile and laugh out her fit. Young\r\nSowerby appeared forgiving enough--he was a perfect gentleman: but\r\nFredi’s appalling sense of fun must try him hard. And those young\r\nfellows are often more wounded by a girl’s thoughtless laughter than by\r\na man’s contempt. Nataly should have protected him. Her face had the\r\nair of a smiling general satisfaction; sign of a pleasure below the\r\nmark required; sign too of a sleepy partner for a battle. Even in the\r\nwonderful kitchen, arched and pillared (where the explanation came to\r\nNesta of Madame Callet’s frequent leave of absence of late, when an\r\ninferior dinner troubled her father in no degree), even there his Nataly\r\nlistened to the transports of the guests with benign indulgence.\r\n\r\n‘Mama!’ said Nesta, ready to be entranced by kitchens in her bubbling\r\nanimation: she meant the recalling of instances of the conspirator her\r\nfather had been.\r\n\r\n‘You none of you guessed Armandine’s business!’ Victor cried, in a glee\r\nthat pushed to make the utmost of this matter and count against chagrin.\r\n‘She was off to Paris; went to test the last inventions:--French brains\r\nare always alert:--and in fact, those kitchen-ranges, gas and coal, and\r\nthe apparatus for warming plates and dishes, the whole of the battery is\r\non the model of the Duc d’Ariane’s--finest in Europe. Well,’ he agreed\r\nwith Colney, ‘to say France is enough.’\r\n\r\nMr. Pempton spoke to Miss Graves of the task for a woman to conduct a\r\ncommand so extensive. And, as when an inoffensive wayfarer has chanced\r\nto set foot near a wasp’s nest, out on him came woman and her champions,\r\nthe worthy and the sham, like a blast of powder.\r\n\r\nVictor ejaculated: ‘Armandine!’ Whoever doubted her capacity, knew not\r\nArmandine; or not knowing Armandine, knew not the capacity in women.\r\n\r\nWith that utterance of her name, he saw the orangey spot on London\r\nBridge, and the sinking Tower and masts and funnels, and the rising of\r\nthem, on his return to his legs; he recollected, that at the very edge\r\nof the fall he had Armandine strongly in his mind. She was to do her\r\npart: Fenellan and Colney on the surface, she below: and hospitality\r\nwas to do its part, and music was impressed--the innocent Concerts; his\r\nwealth, all his inventiveness were to serve;--and merely to attract\r\nand win the tastes of people, for a social support to Lakelands! Merely\r\nthat? Much more:--if Nataly’s coldness to the place would but allow him\r\nto form an estimate of how much. At the same time, being in the grasp of\r\nhis present disappointment, he perceived a meanness in the result,\r\nthat was astonishing and afflicting. He had not ever previously felt\r\nimagination starving at the vision of success. Victor had yet to learn,\r\nthat the man with a material object in aim, is the man of his object;\r\nand the nearer to his mark, often the farther is he from a sober self;\r\nhe is more the arrow of his bow than bow to his arrow. This we pay for\r\nscheming: and success is costly; we find we have pledged the better half\r\nof ourselves to clutch it; not to be redeemed with the whole handful of\r\nour prize! He was, however, learning after his leaping fashion. Nataly’s\r\ndefective sympathy made him look at things through the feelings she\r\ndepressed. A shadow of his missed Idea on London Bridge seemed to cross\r\nhim from the close flapping of a wing within reach. He could say only,\r\nthat it would, if caught, have been an answer to the thought disturbing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNataly drew Colney Durance with her eyes to step beside her, on the\r\ndescent to the terrace. Little Skepsey hove in sight, coming swift as\r\nthe point of an outrigger over the flood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. SKEPSEY IN MOTION\r\n\r\nThe bearer of his master’s midday letters from London shot beyond\r\nNataly as soon as seen, with an apparent snap of his body in passing. He\r\nsteamed to the end of the terrace and delivered the packet, returning\r\nat the same rate of speed, to do proper homage to the lady he so much\r\nrespected. He had left the railway-station on foot instead of taking a\r\nfly, because of a calculation that he would save three minutes; which\r\nhe had not lost for having to come through the raincloud. ‘Perhaps the\r\ncontrary,’ Skepsey said: it might be judged to have accelerated his\r\ncourse: and his hat dripped, and his coat shone, and he soaped his\r\nhands, cheerful as an ouzel-cock when the sun is out again.\r\n\r\n‘Many cracked crowns lately, in the Manly Art?’ Colney inquired of him.\r\nAnd Skepsey answered with precision of statement: ‘Crowns, no, sir; the\r\nnose, it may happen; but it cannot be said to be the rule.’\r\n\r\n‘You are of opinion, that the practice of Scientific Pugilism offers us\r\ncompensation for the broken bridge of a nose?’\r\n\r\n‘In an increase of manly self-esteem: I do, sir, yes.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey was shy of this gentleman’s bite; and he fancied his defence had\r\nbeen correct. Perceiving a crumple of the lips of Mr. Durance, he took\r\nthe attitude of a watchful dubiety.\r\n\r\n‘But, my goodness, you are wet through!’ cried Nataly, reproaching\r\nherself for the tardy compassion; and Nesta ran up to them and heaped\r\na thousand pities on her ‘poor dear Skip,’ and drove him in beneath the\r\nglass-dome to the fragments of pic-nic, and poured champagne for him,\r\n‘lest his wife should have to doctor him for a cold,’ and poured afresh,\r\nwhen he had obeyed her: ‘for the toasting of Lakelands, dear Skepsey!’\r\nimpossible to resist: so he drank, and blinked; and was then told, that\r\nbefore using his knife and fork he must betake himself to some fire\r\nof shavings and chips, where coffee was being made, for the purpose of\r\ndrying his clothes. But this he would not hear of: he was pledged to\r\nbusiness, to convey his master’s letters, and he might have to catch a\r\ntrain by the last quarter-minute, unless it was behind the time-tables;\r\nhe must hold himself ready to start. Entreated, adjured, commanded,\r\nSkepsey commiseratingly observed to Colney Durance, ‘The ladies do not\r\nunderstand, sir!’ For Turk of Constantinople had never a more haremed\r\nopinion of the unfitness of women in the brave world of action. The\r\npersistence of these ladies endeavouring to obstruct him in the course\r\nof his duty, must have succeeded save that for one word of theirs he had\r\ntwo, and twice the promptitude of motion. He explained to them, as to\r\ngood children, that the loss of five minutes might be the loss of a\r\nPost, the loss of thousands of pounds, the loss of the character of a\r\nFirm; and he was away to the terrace. Nesta headed him and waved him\r\nback. She and her mother rebuked him: they called him unreasonable;\r\nwherein they resembled the chief example of the sex to him, in a wife he\r\nhad at home, who levelled that charge against her husband when most she\r\nneeded discipline: the woman laid hand on the very word legitimately his\r\nown for the justification of his process with her.\r\n\r\n‘But, Skips! if you are ill and we have to nurse you!’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\nShe forgot the hospital, he told her cordially, and laughed at the\r\nnotion of a ducking producing a cold or a cold a fever, or anything\r\nconsumption, with him. So the ladies had to keep down their anxious\r\nminds and allow him to stand in wet clothing to eat his cold pie and\r\nsalad.\r\n\r\nMiss Priscilla Graves entering to them, became a witness that they were\r\nseductresses for inducing him to drink wine--and a sparkling wine.\r\n\r\n‘It is to warm him,’ they pleaded; and she said: ‘He must be warm from\r\nhis walk’; and they said: ‘But he is wet’; and said she, without a show\r\nof feeling: ‘Warm water, then’; and Skepsey writhed, as if in the grasp\r\nof anatomists, at being the subject of female contention or humane\r\nconsideration. Miss Graves caught signs of the possible proselyte in\r\nhim; she remarked encouragingly:\r\n\r\n‘I am sure he does not like it; he still has a natural taste.’\r\n\r\nShe distressed his native politeness, for the glass was in his hand, and\r\nhe was fully aware of her high-principled aversion; and he profoundly\r\nbowed to principles, believing his England to be pillared on them; and\r\nthe lady looked like one who bore the standard of a principle; and if we\r\nslap and pinch and starve our appetites, the idea of a principle seems\r\nentering us to support. Subscribing to a principle, our energies are\r\nrefreshed; we have a faith in the country that was not with us before\r\nthe act; and of a real well-founded faith come the glowing thoughts\r\nwhich we have at times: thoughts of England heading the nations; when\r\nthe smell of an English lane under showers challenges Eden, and the\r\nthreading of a London crowd tunes discords to the swell of a cathedral\r\norgan. It may be, that by the renunciation of any description of\r\nalcohol, a man will stand clearer-headed to serve his country. He may\r\nexpect to have a clearer memory, for certain: he will not be asking\r\nhimself, unable to decide, whether his master named a Mr. Journeyman or\r\na Mr. Jarniman, as the person he declined to receive. Either of the\r\ntwo is repulsed upon his application, owing to the guilty similarity of\r\nsounds but what we are to think of is, our own sad state of inefficiency\r\nin failing to remember; which accuses our physical condition, therefore\r\nour habits.--Thus the little man debated, scarcely requiring more than\r\nto hear the right word, to be a convert and make him a garland of the\r\nproselyte’s fetters.\r\n\r\nDestructively for the cause she advocated, Miss Priscilla gestured the\r\nputting forth of an abjuring hand, with the recommendation to him, so to\r\nput aside temptation that instant; and she signified in a very ugly jerk\r\nof her features, the vilely filthy stuff Morality thought it, however\r\npleasing it might be to a palate corrupted by indulgence of the sensual\r\nappetites.\r\n\r\nBut the glass had been handed to him by the lady he respected, who\r\nlooked angelical in offering it, divinely other than ugly; and to her\r\nhe could not be discourteous; not even to pay his homage to the\r\nrepresentative of a principle. He bowed to Miss Graves, and drank, and\r\nrushed forth; hearing shouts behind him.\r\n\r\nHis master had a packet of papers ready, easy for the pocket.\r\n\r\n‘By the way, Skepsey,’ he said, ‘if a man named Jarniman should call at\r\nthe office, I will see him.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s grey eyes came out.\r\n\r\nOr was it Journeyman, that his master would not see; and Jarniman that\r\nhe would?\r\n\r\nHis habit of obedience, pride of apprehension, and the time to catch\r\nthe train, forbade inquiry. Besides he knew of himself of old, that his\r\npuzzles were best unriddled running.\r\n\r\nThe quick of pace are soon in the quick of thoughts.\r\n\r\nJarniman, then, was a man whom his master, not wanting to see, one day,\r\nand wanting to see, on another day, might wish to conciliate: a case of\r\npolicy. Let Jarniman go. Journeyman, on the other hand, was nobody\r\nat all, a ghost of the fancy. Yet this Journeyman was as important an\r\nindividual, he was a dread reality; more important to Skepsey in\r\nthe light of patriot: and only in that light was he permitted of a\r\nscrupulous conscience and modest mind to think upon himself when the\r\nimmediate subject was his master’s interests. For this Journeyman had\r\nnot an excuse for existence in Mr. Radnor’s pronunciation: he was born\r\nof the buzz of a troubled ear, coming of a disordered brain, consequent\r\nnecessarily upon a disorderly stomach, that might protest a degree of\r\ncomparative innocence, but would be shamed utterly under inspection of\r\nthe eye of a lady of principle.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the value to his country of a servant who could not\r\naccurately recollect his master’s words! Miss Graves within him asked\r\nthe rapid little man, whether indeed his ideas were his own after\r\ndraughts of champagne.\r\n\r\nThe ideas, excited to an urgent animation by his racing trot, were a\r\nquiverful in flight over an England terrible to the foe and dancing on\r\nthe green. Right so: but would we keep up the dance, we must be red iron\r\nto touch: and the fighter for conquering is the one who can last and has\r\nthe open brain;--and there you have a point against alcohol. Yes, and\r\nMiss Graves, if she would press it, with her natural face, could be\r\npleasant and persuasive: and she ought to be told she ought to marry,\r\nfor the good of the country. Women taking liquor: Skepsey had a vision\r\nof his wife with rheumy peepers and miauly mouth, as he had once beheld\r\nthe creature:--Oh! they need discipline not such would we have for the\r\nmothers of our English young. Decidedly the women of principle are bound\r\nto enter wedlock; they should be bound by law. Whereas, in the opposing\r\ncase--the binding of the unprincipled to a celibate state--such a law\r\nwould have saved Skepsey from the necessitated commission of deeds of\r\ndiscipline with one of the female sex, and have rescued his progeny from\r\na likeness to the corn-stalk reverting to weed. He had but a son for\r\nEngland’s defence; and the frame of his boy might be set quaking by a\r\nthump on the wind of a drum; the courage of William Barlow Skepsey would\r\nnot stand against a sheep; it would wind-up hares to have a run at him\r\nout in the field. Offspring of a woman of principle!... but there is no\r\nrubbing out in life: why dream of it? Only that one would not have one’s\r\ncountry the loser!\r\n\r\nDwell a moment on the reverse--and first remember the lesson of\r\nthe Captivity of the Jews and the outcry of their backsliding and\r\nrepentance:--see a nation of the honourably begotten; muscular men\r\ndisdaining the luxuries they will occasionally condescend to taste,\r\nlike some tribe in Greece; boxers, rowers, runners, climbers; braced,\r\nindomitable; magnanimous, as only the strong can be; an army at word,\r\nwinning at a stroke the double battle of the hand and the heart: men\r\nwho can walk the paths through the garden of the pleasures. They receive\r\nfitting mates, of a build to promise or aid in ensuring depth of chest\r\nand long reach of arm for their progeny.\r\n\r\nDown goes the world before them.\r\n\r\nAnd we see how much would be due for this to a corps of ladies like Miss\r\nGraves, not allowed to remain too long on the stalk of spinsterhood. Her\r\nage might count twenty-eight: too long! She should be taught that\r\nmen can, though truly ordinary women cannot, walk these orderly paths\r\nthrough the garden. An admission to women, hinting restrictions, on a\r\nticket marked ‘in moderation’ (meaning, that they may pluck a flower or\r\nfruit along the pathway border to which they are confined), speedily,\r\nalas, exhibits them at a mad scramble across the pleasure-beds. They\r\nknow not moderation. Neither for their own sakes nor for the sakes of\r\nPosterity will they hold from excess, when they are not pledged to shun\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, that their minds cannot conceive the abstract, as men do.\r\n\r\nBut there are grounds for supposing that the example before them of a\r\nsex exercising self-control in freedom, would induce women to pledge\r\nthemselves to a similar abnegation, until they gain some sense of touch\r\nupon the impalpable duty to the generations coming after us thanks to\r\nthe voluntary example we set them.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous task, which had hitherto baffled Skepsey in the course of\r\nconversational remonstrances with his wife;--that of getting the Idea of\r\nPosterity into the understanding of its principal agent, might then be\r\nmastered.\r\n\r\nTherefore clearly men have to begin the salutary movement: it manifestly\r\ndevolves upon them. Let them at once take to rigorous physical\r\ntraining. Women under compulsion, as vessels: men in their magnanimity,\r\npatriotically, voluntarily.\r\n\r\nMiss Graves must have had an intimation for him; he guessed it; and it\r\nplunged him into a conflict with her, that did not suffer him to\r\nescape without ruefully feeling the feebleness of his vocabulary: and\r\nconsequently he made a reluctant appeal to figures, and it hung upon the\r\nbolder exhibition of lists and tables as to whether he was beaten; and\r\nif beaten, he was morally her captive; and this being the case, nothing\r\ncould be more repulsive to Skepsey; seeing that he, unable of his nature\r\npassively or partially to undertake a line of conduct, beheld himself\r\nwearing a detestable ‘ribbon,’ for sign of an oath quite needlessly\r\nsworn (simply to satisfy the lady overcoming him with nimbler tongue),\r\nand blocking the streets, marching in bands beneath banners, howling\r\nhymns.\r\n\r\nStatistics, upon which his master and friends, after exchanging opinions\r\nin argument, always fell back, frightened him. As long as they had\r\nno opponents of their own kind, they swept the field, they were\r\nintelligible, as the word ‘principle’ had become. But the appearance of\r\none body of Statistics invariably brought up another; and the strokes\r\nand counterstrokes were like a play of quarter-staff on the sconce,\r\nto knock all comprehension out of Skepsey. Otherwise he would not\r\nunwillingly have inquired to-morrow into the Statistics of the\r\ncontroversy between the waters of the wells and of the casks, prepared\r\nto walk over to the victorious, however objectionable that proceeding.\r\nHe hoped to question his master some day except that his master would\r\nvery naturally have a tendency to sum-up in favour of wine--good\r\nwine, in moderation; just as Miss Graves for the cup of tea--not so\r\nthoughtfully stipulating that it should be good and not too copious.\r\nStatistics are according to their conjurors; they are not independent\r\nbodies, with native colours; they needs must be painted by the different\r\nhands they pass through, and they may be multiplied; a nought or so\r\ncounts for nothing with the teller. Skepsey saw that. Yet they can\r\novercome: even as fictitious battalions, they can overcome. He shrank\r\nfrom the results of a ciphering match having him for object, and was\r\nashamed of feeling to Statistics as women to giants; nevertheless he\r\nacknowledged that the badge was upon him, if Miss Graves should beat\r\nher master in her array of figures, to insist on his wearing it, as she\r\nwould, she certainly would. And against his internal conviction perhaps;\r\nwith the knowledge that the figures were an unfortified display, and his\r\noath of bondage an unmanly servility, the silliest of ceremonies! He was\r\nshockingly feminine to Statistics.\r\n\r\nMr. Durance despised them: he called them, arguing against Mr. Radnor,\r\n‘those emotional things,’ not comprehensibly to Skepsey. But Mr.\r\nDurance, a very clever gentleman, could not be right in everything. He\r\nmade strange remarks upon his country. Dr. Yatt attributed them to the\r\nstate of ‘his digestion.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Fenellan had said of Mr. Durance that, as ‘a barrister wanting\r\nbriefs, the speech in him had been bottled too long and was an overripe\r\nwine dripping sour drops through the rotten cork.’ Mr. Fenellan said it\r\nlaughing, he meant no harm. Skepsey was sure he had the words. He heard\r\nno more than other people hear; he remembered whole sentences, and many:\r\non one of his runs, this active little machine, quickened by motion to\r\nfire, revived the audible of years back; whatever suited his turn of\r\nmind at the moment rushed to the rapid wheels within him. His master’s\r\nbusiness and friends, his country’s welfare and advancement, these, with\r\nrecords, items, anticipations, of the manlier sports to decorate, were\r\nhis current themes; all being chopped and tossed and mixed in salad\r\naccordance by his fervour of velocity. And if you would like a further\r\ndefinition of Genius, think of it as a form of swiftness. It is the\r\nlively young great-grandson, in the brain, of the travelling force which\r\nmathematicians put to paper, in a row of astounding ciphers, for the\r\nmotion of earth through space; to the generating of heat, whereof\r\nis multiplication, whereof deposited matter, and so your chaos, your\r\nhalf-lighted labyrinth, your, ceaseless pressure to evolvement; and then\r\nLight, and so Creation, order, the work of Genius. What do you say?\r\n\r\nWithout having a great brain, the measure of it possessed by Skepsey was\r\nalive under strong illumination. In his heart, while doing penance for\r\nhis presumptuousness, he believed that he could lead regiments of men.\r\nHe was not the army’s General, he was the General’s Lieutenant, now and\r\nthen venturing to suggest a piece of counsel to his Chief. On his own\r\nparticular drilled regiments, his Chief may rely; and on his knowledge\r\nof the country of the campaign, roads, morasses, masking hills, dividing\r\nrivers. He had mapped for himself mentally the battles of conquerors in\r\nhis favourite historic reading; and he understood the value of a plan,\r\nand the danger of sticking to it, and the advantage of a big army for\r\nflanking; and he manoeuvred a small one cunningly to make it a bolt at\r\nthe telling instant. Dartrey Fenellan had explained to him Frederick’s\r\noblique attack, Napoleon’s employment of the artillery arm preparatory\r\nto the hurling of the cataract on the spot of weakness, Wellington’s\r\nparallel march with Marmont up to the hour of the decisive cut through\r\nthe latter at Salamanca; and Skepsey treated his enemy to the like,\r\ndeferentially reporting the engagement to a Chief whom his modesty kept\r\nin eminence, for the receiving of the principal honours. As to his men,\r\nof all classes and sorts, they are so supple with training that they\r\nsustain a defeat like the sturdy pugilist a knock off his legs, and up\r\nsmiling a minute after--one of the truly beautiful sights on this\r\nearth! They go at the double half a day, never sounding a single pair\r\nof bellows among them. They have their appetites in full control, to eat\r\nwhen they can, or cheerfully fast. They have healthy frames, you see;\r\nand as the healthy frame is not artificially heated, it ensues that,\r\nunder any title you like, they profess the principles--into the bog we\r\ngo, we have got round to it!--the principles of those horrible marching\r\nand chanting people!\r\n\r\nThen, must our England, to be redoubtable to the enemy, be a detestable\r\ncountry for habitation?\r\n\r\nHere was a knot.\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s head dropped lower, he went as a ram. The sayings of Mr.\r\nDurance about his dear England: that ‘her remainder of life is in the\r\nactivity of her diseases’--that ‘she has so fed upon Pap of Compromise\r\nas to be unable any longer to conceive a muscular resolution’: that ‘she\r\nis animated only as the carcase to the blow-fly’; and so forth:--charged\r\non him during his wrestle with his problem. And the gentlemen had said,\r\nhad permitted himself to say, that our England’s recent history was a\r\nprovincial apothecary’s exhibition of the battle of bane and antidote.\r\nMr. Durance could hardly mean it. But how could one answer him when he\r\nspoke of the torpor of the people, and of the succeeding Governments as\r\na change of lacqueys--or the purse-string’s lacqueys? He said, that Old\r\nEngland has taken to the arm-chair for good, and thinks it her whole\r\nbusiness to pronounce opinions and listen to herself; and that, in the\r\nface of an armed Europe, this great nation is living on sufferance. Oh!\r\n\r\nSkepsey had uttered the repudiating exclamation.\r\n\r\n‘Feel quite up to it?’ he was asked by his neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe mover of armed hosts for the defence of the country sat in a\r\nthird-class carriage of the train, approaching the first of the stations\r\non the way to town. He was instantly up to the level of an external\r\nworld, and fell into give and take with a burly broad communicative man;\r\nlocated in London, but born in the North, in view of Durham cathedral,\r\nas he thanked his Lord; who was of the order of pork-butcher; which\r\nsucculent calling had carried him down to near upon the borders of\r\nSurrey and Sussex, some miles beyond the new big house of a Mister\r\nwhose name he had forgotten, though he had heard it mentioned by an\r\nacquaintance interested in the gentleman’s doings. But his object was to\r\nhave a look at a rare breed of swine, worth the journey; that didn’t\r\nrun to fat so much as to flavour, had longer legs, sharp snouts to plump\r\ntheir hams; over from Spain, it seemed; and the gentleman owning\r\nthem was for selling them, finding them wild past correction. But the\r\nacquaintance mentioned, who was down to visit t’ other gentleman’s big\r\nnew edifice in workmen’s hands, had a mother, who had been cook to a\r\nfamily, and was now widow of a cook’s shop; ham, beef, and sausages,\r\nprime pies to order; and a good specimen herself; and if ever her son\r\nsaw her spirit at his bedside, there wouldn’t be room for much else in\r\nthat chamber--supposing us to keep our shapes. But he was the right sort\r\nof son, anxious to push his mother’s shop where he saw a chance, and\r\ndo it cheap; and those foreign pigs, after a disappointment to their\r\nimporter, might be had pretty cheap, and were accounted tasty.\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s main thought was upon war: the man had discoursed of pigs.\r\n\r\nHe informed the man of his having heard from a scholar, that pigs had\r\nbeen the cause of more bloody battles than any other animal.\r\n\r\nHow so? the pork-butcher asked, and said he was not much of a scholar,\r\nand pigs might be provoking, but he had not heard they were a cause of\r\nstrife between man and man. For possession of them, Skepsey explained.\r\nOh! possession! Why, we’ve heard of bloody battles for the possession of\r\nwomen! Men will fight for almost anything they care to get or call their\r\nown, the pork-butcher said; and he praised Old England for avoiding war.\r\nSkepsey nodded. How if war is forced on us? Then we fight. Suppose we\r\nare not prepared?--We soon get that up. Skepsey requested him to state\r\nthe degree of resistance he might think he could bring against a pair of\r\nskilful fists, in a place out of hearing of the police.\r\n\r\n‘Say, you!’ said the pork-butcher, and sharply smiled, for he was a man\r\nof size.\r\n\r\n‘I would give you two minutes,’ rejoined Skepsey, eyeing him intently\r\nand kindly: insomuch that it could be seen he was not in the conundrum\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n‘Rather short allowance, eh, master?’ said the bigger man. ‘Feel here’;\r\nhe straightened out his arm and doubled it, raising a proud bridge of\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nSkepsey performed the national homage to muscle.\r\n\r\n‘Twice that, would not help without the science,’ he remarked, and let\r\nhis arm be gripped in turn.\r\n\r\nThe pork-butcher’s throat sounded, as it were, commas and colons,\r\npunctuations in his reflections, while he tightened fingers along the\r\niron lump. ‘Stringy. You’re a wiry one, no mistake.’ It was encomium.\r\nWith the ingrained contempt of size for a smallness that has not yet\r\ntaught it the prostrating lesson, he said: ‘Weight tells.’\r\n\r\n‘In a wrestle,’ Skepsey admitted. ‘Allow me to say, you would not touch\r\nme.’\r\n\r\n‘And how do you know I’m not a trifle handy with the maulers myself?’\r\n\r\n‘You will pardon me for saying, it would be worse for you if you were.’\r\n\r\nThe pork-butcher was flung backward. ‘Are you a Professor, may I\r\ninquire?’\r\n\r\nSkepsey rejected the title. ‘I can engage to teach young men, upon a\r\nproper observance of first principles.’\r\n\r\n‘They be hanged!’ cried the ruffled pork-butcher. ‘Our best men never\r\ngot it out of books. Now, you tell me--you’ve got a spiflicating style\r\nof talk about you--no brag, you tell me--course, the best man wins, if\r\nyou mean that: now, if I was one of ‘em, and I fetches you a bit of a\r\nflick, how then? Would you be ready to step out with a real Professor?’\r\n\r\n‘I should claim a fair field,’ was the answer, made in modesty.\r\n\r\n‘And you’d expect to whop me with they there principles of yours?’\r\n\r\n‘I should expect to.’\r\n\r\n‘Bang me!’ was roared. After a stare at the mild little figure with the\r\nfitfully dead-levelled large grey eyes in front of him, the pork-butcher\r\nresumed: ‘Take you for the man you say you be, you’re just the man for\r\nmy friend Jam and me. He dearly loves to see a set-to, self the same.\r\nWhat prettier? And if you would be so obliging some day as to favour us\r\nwith a display, we’d head a cap conformably, whether you’d the best of\r\nit, according to your expectations, or t’ other way:--For there never\r\nwas shame in a jolly good licking as the song says: that is, if you take\r\nit and make it appear jolly good. And find you an opponent meet and fit,\r\nnever doubt. Ever had the worse of an encounter, sir?’\r\n\r\n‘Often, Sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, that’s good. And it didn’t destroy your confidence?’\r\n\r\n‘Added to it, I hope.’\r\n\r\nAt this point, it became a crying necessity for Skepsey to escape from\r\nan area of boastfulness, into which he had fallen inadvertently; and he\r\nhastened to apologize ‘for his personal reference,’ that was intended\r\nfor an illustration of our country caught unawares by a highly trained\r\npicked soldiery, inferior in numbers to the patriotic levies, but sharp\r\nat the edge and knowing how to strike. Measure the axe, measure the\r\ntree; and which goes down first?\r\n\r\n‘Invasion, is it?--and you mean, we’re not to hit back?’ the\r\npork-butcher bellowed, and presently secured a murmured approbation from\r\nan audience of three, that had begun to comprehend the dialogue, and\r\nstrengthened him in a manner to teach Skepsey the foolishness of ever\r\nurging analogies of too extended a circle to close sharply on the mark.\r\nHe had no longer a chance, he was overborne, identified with the fated\r\ninvader, rolled away into the chops of the Channel, to be swallowed\r\nup entire, and not a rag left of him, but John Bull tucking up his\r\nshirtsleeves on the shingle beach, ready for a second or a third; crying\r\nto them to come on.\r\n\r\nWarmed by his Bullish victory, and friendly to the vanquished, the\r\npork-butcher told Skepsey he should like to see more of him, and\r\nintroduced himself on a card Benjamin Shaplow, not far from the Bank.\r\n\r\nThey parted at the Terminus, where three shrieks of an engine, sounding\r\nlike merry messages of the damned to their congeners in the anticipatory\r\nstench of the cab-droppings above, disconnected sane hearing; perverted\r\nit, no doubt. Or else it was the stamp of a particular name on his mind,\r\nwhich impressed Skepsey, as he bored down the street and across the\r\nbridge, to fancy in recollection, that Mr. Shaplow, when reiterating the\r\nwish for self and friend to witness a display of his cunning with the\r\nfists, had spoken the name of Jarniman. An unusual name yet more\r\nthan one Jarniman might well exist. And unlikely that a friend of the\r\npork-butcher would be the person whom Mr. Radnor first prohibited and\r\nthen desired to receive. It hardly mattered:--considering that the Dutch\r\nNavy did really, incredible as it seems now, come sailing a good way\r\nup the River Thames, into the very main artery of Old England. And\r\nwhat thought the Tower of it? Skepsey looked at the Tower in sympathy,\r\nwondering whether the Tower had seen those impudent Dutch a nice people\r\nat home, he had heard. Mr. Shaplow’s Jarniman might actually be Mr.\r\nRadnor’s, he inclined to think. At any rate he was now sure of the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. WHEREIN WE BEHOLD THE COUPLE JUSTIFIED OF LOVE HAVING SIGHT\r\nOF THEIR SCOURGE\r\n\r\nFenellan, in a musing exclamation, that was quite spontaneous, had put\r\na picture on the departing Skepsey, as observed from an end of the\r\nLakelands upper terrace-walk.\r\n\r\n‘Queer little water-wagtail it is!’ And Lady Grace Halley and Miss\r\nGraves and Mrs. Cormyn, snugly silken dry ones, were so taken with the\r\npretty likeness after hearing Victor call the tripping dripping creature\r\nthe happiest man in England, that they nursed it in their minds for a\r\nBewick tailpiece to the chapter of a pleasant rural day. It imbedded the\r\nday in an idea that it had been rural.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted almost for construction to those who will define us\r\nbriefly: we are but scattered leaves to the general comprehension of\r\nus until such a work of binding and labelling is done. And should the\r\ndefinition be not so correct as brevity pretends to make it at one\r\nstroke, we are at least rendered portable; thus we pass into the\r\nconceptions of our fellows, into the records, down to posterity.\r\nAnecdotes of England’s happiest man were related, outlines of\r\nhis personal history requested. His nomination in chief among the\r\ntraditionally very merry Islanders was hardly borne out by the tale\r\nof his enchainment with a drunken yokefellow--unless upon the Durance\r\nversion of the felicity of his countrymen; still, the water-wagtail\r\ncarried it, Skepsey trotted into memories. Heroes conducted up Fame’s\r\ntemple-steps by ceremonious historians, who are studious, when the\r\nplatform is reached, of the art of setting them beneath the flambeau\r\nof a final image, before thrusting them inside to be rivetted on their\r\npedestals, have an excellent chance of doing the same, let but the\r\nprovident narrators direct that image to paint the thing a moth-like\r\nhumanity desires, in the thing it shrinks from. Miss Priscilla Graves\r\nnow fastened her meditations upon Skepsey; and it was important to him.\r\n\r\nTobacco withdrew the haunting shadow of the Rev. Septimus Barmby from\r\nNesta. She strolled beside Louise de Seilles, to breathe sweet-sweet in\r\nthe dear friend’s ear and tell her she loved her. The presence of the\r\nGerman had, without rousing animosity, damped the young Frenchwoman,\r\neven to a revulsion when her feelings had been touched by hearing praise\r\nof her France, and wounded by the subjects of the praise. She bore the\r\nnational scar, which is barely skin-clothing of a gash that will not\r\nheal since her country was overthrown and dismembered. Colney Durance\r\ncould excuse the unreasonableness in her, for it had a dignity, and she\r\ncontrolled it, and quietly suffered, trusting to the steady, tireless,\r\nconcentrated aim of her France. In the Gallic mind of our time, France\r\nappears as a prematurely buried Glory, that heaves the mound oppressing\r\nbreath and cannot cease; and calls hourly, at times keenly, to be\r\nremembered, rescued from the pain and the mould-spots of that foul\r\nsepulture. Mademoiselle and Colney were friends, partly divided by\r\nher speaking once of revanche; whereupon he assumed the chair of the\r\nMoralist, with its right to lecture, and went over to the enemy; his\r\ntalk savoured of a German. Our holding of the balance, taking two sides,\r\nis incomprehensible to a people quivering with the double wound to body\r\nand soul. She was of Breton blood. Cymric enough was in Nesta to catch\r\nany thrill from her and join to her mood, if it hung out a colour sad or\r\ngay, and was noble, as any mood of this dear Louise would surely be.\r\n\r\nNataly was not so sympathetic. Only the Welsh and pure Irish are quick\r\nat the feelings of the Celtic French. Nataly came of a Yorkshire stock;\r\nshe had the bravery, humaneness and generous temper of our civilized\r\nNorth, and a taste for mademoiselle’s fine breeding, with a distaste\r\nfor the singular air of superiority in composure which it was granted to\r\nmademoiselle to wear with an unassailable reserve when the roughness of\r\nthe commercial boor was obtrusive. She said of her to Colney, as they\r\nwatched the couple strolling by the lake below: ‘Nesta brings her out of\r\nher frosts. I suppose it’s the presence of Dr. Schlesien. I have known\r\nit the same after an evening of Wagner’s music.’\r\n\r\n‘Richard Wagner Germanized ridicule of the French when they were down,’\r\nsaid Colney. ‘She comes of a blood that never forgives.’\r\n\r\n‘“Never forgives” is horrible to think of! I fancied you liked your\r\n“Kelts,” as you call them.’\r\n\r\nColney seized on a topic that shelved a less agreeable one that he saw\r\ncoming. ‘You English won’t descend to understand what does not resemble\r\nyou. The French are in a state of feverish patriotism. You refuse to\r\ntreat them for a case of fever. They are lopped of a limb: you tell them\r\nto be at rest!’\r\n\r\n‘You know I am fond of them.’\r\n\r\n‘And the Kelts, as they are called, can’t and won’t forgive injuries;\r\nlook at Ireland, look at Wales, and the Keltic Scot. Have you heard them\r\ntalk? It happened in the year 1400: it’s alive to them as if it were\r\nyesterday. Old History is as dead to the English as their first father.\r\nThey beg for the privilege of pulling the forelock to the bearers of the\r\ntitles of the men who took their lands from them and turn them to the\r\nuses of cattle. The Saxon English had, no doubt, a heavier thrashing\r\nthan any people allowed to subsist ever received: you see it to this\r\nday; the crick of the neck at the name of a lord is now concealed and\r\ndenied, but they have it and betray the effects; and it’s patent in\r\ntheir Journals, all over their literature. Where it’s not seen, another\r\nblood’s at work. The Kelt won’t accept the form of slavery. Let him be\r\nservile, supple, cunning, treacherous, and to appearance time-serving,\r\nhe will always remember his day of manly independence and who robbed\r\nhim: he is the poetic animal of the races of modern men.’\r\n\r\n‘You give him Pagan colours.’\r\n\r\n‘Natural colours. He does not offer the other cheek or turn his back to\r\nbe kicked after a knock to the ground. Instead of asking him to forgive,\r\nwhich he cannot do, you must teach him to admire. A mercantile community\r\nguided by Political Economy from the ledger to the banquet presided over\r\nby its Dagon Capital, finds that difficult. However, there ‘s the secret\r\nof him; that I respect in him. His admiration of an enemy or oppressor\r\ndoing great deeds, wins him entirely. He is an active spirit, not your\r\nnegative passive letter-of-Scripture Insensible. And his faults, short\r\nof ferocity, are amusing.’\r\n\r\n‘But the fits of ferocity!’\r\n\r\n‘They are inconscient, real fits. They come of a hot nerve. He is\r\nmanageable, sober too, when his mind is charged. As to the French\r\npeople, they are the most mixed of any European nation; so they are\r\npacked with contrasts: they are full of sentiment, they are sharply\r\nlogical; free-thinkers, devotees; affectionate, ferocious; frivolous,\r\ntenacious; the passion of the season operating like sun or moon on these\r\nqualities; and they can reach to ideality out of sensualism. Below your\r\nlevel, they’re above it: a paradox is at home with them!’\r\n\r\n‘My friend, you speak seriously--an unusual compliment,’ Nataly said,\r\nand ungratefully continued: ‘You know what is occupying me. I want your\r\nopinion. I guess it. I want to hear--a mean thirst perhaps, and you\r\nwould pay me any number of compliments to avoid the subject; but let me\r\nhear:--this house!’\r\n\r\nColney shrugged in resignation. ‘Victor works himself out,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n‘We are to go through it all again?’\r\n\r\n‘If you have not the force to contain him.’\r\n\r\n‘How contain him?’\r\n\r\nUp went Colney’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n‘You may see it all before you,’ he said, ‘straight as the Seine\r\nchaussee from the hill of La Roche Guyon.’\r\n\r\nHe looked for her recollection of the scene.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, the happy ramble that year!’ she cried. ‘And my Nesta just seven.\r\nWe had been six months at Craye. Every day of our life together looks\r\nhappy to me, looking back, though I know that every day had the same\r\ntroubles. I don’t think I’m deficient in courage; I think I could\r\nmeet.... But the false position so cruelly weakens me. I am no woman’s\r\nequal when I have to receive or visit. It seems easier to meet the worst\r\nin life-danger, death, anything. Pardon me for talking so. Perhaps we\r\nneed not have left Craye or Creckholt...?’ she hinted an interrogation.\r\n‘Though I am not sorry; it is not good to be where one tastes poison.\r\nHere it may be as deadly, worse. Dear friend, I am so glad you remember\r\nLa Roche Guyon. He was popular with the dear French people.’\r\n\r\n‘In spite of his accent.’\r\n\r\n‘It is not so bad?’\r\n\r\n‘And that you’ll defend!’\r\n\r\n‘Consider: these neighbours we come among; they may have heard...’\r\n\r\n‘Act on the assumption.’\r\n\r\n‘You forget the principal character. Victor promises; he may have learnt\r\na lesson at Creckholt. But look at this house he has built. How can\r\nI--any woman--contain him! He must have society.’\r\n\r\n‘Paraitre!’\r\n\r\n‘He must be in the front. He has talked of Parliament.’\r\n\r\nColney’s liver took the thrust of a skewer through it. He spoke as in\r\nmeditative encomium: ‘His entry into Parliament would promote himself\r\nand family to a station of eminence naked over the Clock Tower of the\r\nHouse.’\r\n\r\nShe moaned. ‘At the vilest, I cannot regret my conduct--bear what I may.\r\nI can bear real pain: what kills me is, the suspicion. And I feel it\r\nlike a guilty wretch! And I do not feel the guilt! I should do the same\r\nagain, on reflection. I do believe it saved him. I do; oh! I do, I do.\r\nI cannot expect my family to see with my eyes. You know them--my brother\r\nand sisters think I have disgraced them; they put no value on my saving\r\nhim. It sounds childish; it is true. He had fallen into a terrible black\r\nmood.’\r\n\r\n‘He had an hour of gloom.’\r\n\r\n‘An hour!’\r\n\r\n‘But an hour, with him! It means a good deal.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, friend, I take your words. He sinks terribly when he sinks at\r\nall.--Spare us a little while.--We have to judge of what is good in the\r\ncircumstances: I hear your reply! But the principal for me to study is\r\nVictor. You have accused me of being the voice of the enamoured woman.\r\nI follow him, I know; I try to advise; I find it is wisdom to submit. My\r\npeople regard my behaviour as a wickedness or a madness. I did save him.\r\nI joined my fate with his. I am his mate, to help, and I cannot oppose\r\nhim, to distract him. I do my utmost for privacy. He must entertain.\r\nBelieve me, I feel for them--sisters and brother. And now that my\r\nsisters are married... My brother has a man’s hardness.’\r\n\r\n‘Colonel Dreighton did not speak harshly, at our last meeting.’\r\n\r\n‘He spoke of me?’\r\n\r\n‘He spoke in the tone of a brother.’\r\n\r\n‘Victor promises--I won’t repeat it. Yes, I see the house! There appears\r\nto be a prospect, a hope--I cannot allude to it. Craye and Creckholt may\r\nhave been some lesson to him. Selwyn spoke of me kindly? Ah, yes, it is\r\nthe way with my people to pretend that Victor has been the ruin of me,\r\nthat they may come round to family sentiments. In the same way,\r\nhis relatives, the Duvidney ladies, have their picture of the woman\r\nmisleading him. Imagine me the naughty adventuress!’--Nataly falsified\r\nthe thought insurgent at her heart, in adding: ‘I do not say I am\r\nblameless.’ It was a concession to the circumambient enemy, of whom even\r\na good friend was apart, and not better than a respectful emissary. The\r\ndearest of her friends belonged to that hostile world. Only Victor, no\r\nother, stood with her against the world. Her child, yes; the love of her\r\nchild she had; but the child’s destiny was an alien phantom, looking at\r\nher with harder eyes than she had vision of in her family. She did not\r\nsay she was blameless, did not affect the thought. She would have wished\r\nto say, for small encouragement she would have said, that her case could\r\nbe pleaded.\r\n\r\nColney’s features were not inviting, though the expression was not\r\nrepellent. She sighed deeply; and to count on something helpful by\r\nmentioning it, reverted to the ‘prospect’ which there appeared to be.\r\n‘Victor speaks of the certainty of his release.’\r\n\r\nHis release! Her language pricked a satirist’s gallbladder. Colney\r\nrefrained from speaking to wound, and enjoyed a silence that did it.\r\n\r\n‘Do you see any possibility?--you knew her,’ she said coldly.\r\n\r\n‘Counting the number of times he has been expecting the release, he is\r\nbound to believe it near at hand.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t?’ she asked: her bosom was up in a crisis of expectation for\r\nthe answer: and on a pause of half-a-minute, she could have uttered the\r\nanswer herself.\r\n\r\nHe perceived the insane eagerness through her mask, and despised it,\r\npitying the woman. ‘And you don’t,’ he said. ‘You catch at delusions,\r\nto excuse the steps you consent to take. Or you want me to wear the\r\nblinkers, the better to hoodwink your own eyes. You see it as well as\r\nI: If you enter that house, you have to go through the same as at\r\nCreckholt:--and he’ll be the first to take fright.’\r\n\r\n‘He finds you in tears: he is immensely devoted; he flings up all to\r\nprotect “his Nataly.”’\r\n\r\n‘No: you are unjust to him. He would fling up all:’--\r\n\r\n‘But his Nataly prefers to be dragged through fire? As you please!’\r\n\r\nShe bowed to her chastisement. One motive in her consultation with him\r\ncame of the knowledge of his capacity to inflict it and his honesty in\r\nthe act, and a thirst she had to hear the truth loud-tongued from him;\r\ntogether with a feeling that he was excessive and satiric, not to be\r\nread by the letter of his words: and in consequence, she could bear\r\nthe lash from him, and tell her soul that he overdid it, and have an\r\nunjustly-treated self to cherish.--But in very truth she was a woman who\r\nloved to hear the truth; she was formed to love the truth her position\r\nreduced her to violate; she esteemed the hearing it as medical to her;\r\nshe selected for counsellor him who would apply it: so far she went on\r\nthe straight way; and the desire for a sustaining deception from the\r\nmouth of a trustworthy man set her hanging on his utterances with an\r\nanxious hope of the reverse of what was to come and what she herself\r\napprehended, such as checked her pulses and iced her feet and fingers.\r\nThe reason being, not that she was craven or absurd or paradoxical,\r\nbut that, living at an intenser strain upon her nature than she or any\r\naround her knew, her strength snapped, she broke down by chance there\r\nwhere Colney was rendered spiteful in beholding the display of her\r\ninconsequent if not puling sex.\r\n\r\nShe might have sought his counsel on another subject, if a paralyzing\r\nchill of her frame in the foreview of it had allowed her to speak: she\r\nfelt grave alarms in one direction, where Nesta stood in the eye of her\r\nfather; besides an unformed dread that the simplicity in generosity of\r\nVictor’s nature was doomed to show signs of dross ultimately, under the\r\nnecessity he imposed upon himself to run out his forecasts, and scheme,\r\nand defensively compel the world to serve his ends, for the protection\r\nof those dear to him.\r\n\r\nAt night he was particularly urgent with her for the harmonious duet in\r\npraise of Lakelands; and plied her with questions all round and about\r\nit, to bring out the dulcet accord. He dwelt on his choice of costly\r\nmarbles, his fireplace and mantelpiece designs, the great hall, and\r\nsuggestions for imposing and beautiful furniture; concordantly enough,\r\nfor the large, the lofty and rich of colour won her enthusiasm; but\r\noverwhelmingly to any mood of resistance; and strangely in a man who had\r\nof late been adopting, as if his own, a modern tone, or the social and\r\nliterary hints of it, relating to the right uses of wealth, and the duty\r\nas well as the delight of living simply.\r\n\r\n‘Fredi was pleased.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, she was, dear.’\r\n\r\n‘She is our girl, my love. “I could live and die here!” Live, she may.\r\nThere’s room enough.’\r\n\r\nNataly saw the door of a covert communication pointed at in that remark.\r\nShe gathered herself for an effort to do battle.\r\n\r\n‘She’s quite a child, Victor.’\r\n\r\n‘The time begins to run. We have to look forward now:--I declare, it’s I\r\nwho seem the provident mother for Fredi!’\r\n\r\n‘Let our girl wait; don’t hurry her mind to... She is happy with her\r\nfather and mother. She is in the happiest time of her life, before those\r\nfeelings distract.’\r\n\r\n‘If we see good fortune for her, we can’t let it pass her.’\r\n\r\nA pang of the resolution now to debate the case with Victor, which\r\nwould be of necessity to do the avoided thing and roll up the forbidden\r\ncurtain opening on their whole history past and prospective, was met in\r\nNataly’s bosom by the more bitter immediate confession that she was\r\nnot his match. To speak would be to succumb; and shamefully after the\r\neffort; and hopelessly after being overborne by him. There was not the\r\nanticipation of a set contest to animate the woman’s naturally valiant\r\nheart; he was too strong: and his vividness in urgency overcame her in\r\nadvance, fascinated her sensibility through recollection; he fanned an\r\ninclination, lighted it to make it a passion, a frenzied resolve--she\r\nremembered how and when. She had quivering cause to remember the fateful\r\nday of her step, in a letter received that morning from a married\r\nsister, containing no word of endearment or proposal for a meeting. An\r\nunregretted day, if Victor would think of the dues to others; that is,\r\nwould take station with the world to see his reflected position, instead\r\nof seeing it through their self-justifying knowledge of the honourable\r\ntruth of their love, and pressing to claim and snatch at whatsoever the\r\nworld bestows on its orderly subjects.\r\n\r\nThey had done evil to no one as yet. Nataly thought that;\r\nnot-withstanding the outcry of the ancient and withered woman who bore\r\nVictor Radnor’s name: for whom, in consequence of the rod the woman had\r\nused, this tenderest of hearts could summon no emotion. If she had it,\r\nthe thing was not to be hauled up to consciousness. Her feeling was,\r\nthat she forgave the wrinkled Malignity: pity and contrition dissolving\r\nin the effort to produce the placable forgiveness. She was frigid\r\nbecause she knew rightly of herself, that she in the place of power\r\nwould never have struck so meanly. But the mainspring of the feeling\r\nin an almost remorseless bosom drew from certain chance expressions of\r\nretrospective physical distaste on Victor’s part;--hard to keep from a\r\nshort utterance between the nuptial two, of whom the unshamed exuberant\r\nmale has found the sweet reverse in his mate, a haven of heavenliness,\r\nto delight in:--these conjoined with a woman’s unspoken pleading ideas\r\nof her own, on her own behalf, had armed her jealously in vindication of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nNow, as long as they did no palpable wrong about them, Nataly could\r\nargue her case in her conscience--deep down and out of hearing, where\r\nwomen under scourge of the laws they have not helped decree may and do\r\ndeliver their minds. She stood in that subterranean recess for Nature\r\nagainst the Institutions of Man: a woman little adapted for the post of\r\nrevel; but to this, by the agency of circumstances, it had come; she who\r\nwas designed by nature to be an ornament of those Institutions opposed\r\nthem and when thinking of the rights and the conduct of the decrepit\r\nLegitimate--virulent in a heathen vindictiveness declaring itself\r\nholy--she had Nature’s logic, Nature’s voice, for self-defence. It was\r\neloquent with her, to the deafening of other voices in herself, even to\r\nthe convincing of herself, when she was wrought by the fires within to\r\nfeel elementally. The other voices within her issued of the acknowledged\r\ndues to her family and to the world--the civilization protecting women:\r\nsentences thereanent in modern books and Journals. But the remembrance\r\nof moods of fiery exaltation, when the Nature she called by name of Love\r\nraised the chorus within to stop all outer buzzing, was, in a perpetual\r\nstruggle with a whirlpool, a constant support while she and Victor\r\nwere one at heart. The sense of her standing alone made her sway; and\r\na thought of differences with him caused frightful apprehensions of the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nLuxuriously she applied to his public life for witness that he had\r\ngoverned wisely as well as affectionately so long; and he might\r\ntherefore, with the chorussing of the world of public men, expect a\r\nwoman blindfold to follow his lead. But no; we may be rebels against\r\nour time and its Laws: if we are really for Nature, we are not lawless.\r\nNataly’s untutored scruples, which came side by side with her ability to\r\nplead for her acts, restrained her from complicity in the ensnaring of\r\na young man of social rank to espouse the daughter of a couple socially\r\ninsurgent-stained, to common thinking, should denunciation come. The\r\nNature upholding her fled at a vision of a stranger entangled. Pitiable\r\nto reflect, that he was not one of the adventurer-lords of prey who hunt\r\nand run down shadowed heiresses and are congratulated on their luck in\r\na tolerating country! How was the young man to be warned? How, under the\r\nhappiest of suppositions, propitiate his family! And such a family, if\r\nconsenting with knowledge, would consent only for the love of money. It\r\nwas angling with as vile a bait as the rascal lord’s. Humiliation hung\r\non the scheme; it struck to scorching in the contemplation of it. And it\r\ndarkened her reading of Victor’s character.\r\n\r\nShe did not ask for the specification of a ‘good fortune that might\r\npass’; wishing to save him from his wonted twists of elusiveness, and\r\nherself with him from the dread discussion it involved upon one point.\r\n\r\n‘The day was pleasant to all, except perhaps poor mademoiselle,’ she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n‘Peridon should have come?’\r\n\r\n‘Present or absent, his chances are not brilliant, I fear.’\r\n\r\n‘And Pempton and Priscy!’\r\n\r\n‘They are growing cooler!’\r\n\r\n‘With their grotesque objections to one another’s habits at table!’\r\n\r\n‘Can we ever hope to get them over it?’\r\n\r\n‘When Priscy drinks Port and Pempton munches beef, Colney says.’\r\n\r\n‘I should say, when they feel warmly enough to think little of their\r\ndifferences.’\r\n\r\n‘Fire smoothes the creases, yes; and fire is what they’re both wanting\r\nin. Though Priscy has Concert-pathos in her voice:--couldn’t act a bit!\r\nAnd Pempton’s ‘cello tones now and then have gone through me--simply\r\nfrom his fiddle-bow, I believe. Don’t talk to me of feeling in a couple,\r\nwithin reach of one another and sniffing objections.--Good, then, for a\r\nsuccessful day to-day so far?’\r\n\r\nHe neared her, wooing her; and she assented, with a franker smile than\r\nshe had worn through the day.\r\n\r\nThe common burden on their hearts--the simple discussion to come of the\r\ntask of communicating dire actualities to their innocent Nesta--was laid\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. TREATS OF THE DUMBNESS POSSIBLE WITH MEMBERS OF A HOUSEHOLD\r\nHAVING ONE HEART\r\n\r\nTwo that live together in union are supposed to be intimate on every\r\nleaf. Particularly when they love one another and the cause they have\r\nat heart is common to them in equal measure, the uses of a cordial\r\nfamiliarity forbid reserves upon important matters between them, as\r\nwe think; not thinking of an imposed secretiveness, beneath the false\r\nexternal of submissiveness, which comes of an experience of repeated\r\ninefficiency to maintain a case in opposition, on the part of the\r\nloquently weaker of the pair. In Constitutional Kingdoms a powerful\r\nGovernment needs not to be tyrannical to lean oppressively; it is more\r\nserviceable to party than agreeable to country; and where the alliance\r\nof men and women binds a loving couple, of whom one is a torrent of\r\npersuasion, their differings are likely to make the other resemble a log\r\nof the torrent. It is borne along; it dreams of a distant corner of the\r\nway for a determined stand; it consents to its whirling in anticipation\r\nof an undated hour when it will no longer be neutral.\r\n\r\nThere may be, moreover, while each has the key of the fellow breast, a\r\nmutually sensitive nerve to protest against intrusion of light or sound.\r\nThe cloud over the name of their girl could now strike Nataly and\r\nVictor dumb in their taking of counsel. She divined that his hint had\r\nencouraged him to bring the crisis nearer, and he that her comprehension\r\nhad become tremblingly awake. They shrank, each of them, the more from\r\nan end drawing closely into view. All subjects glooming off or darkening\r\nup to it were shunned by them verbally, and if they found themselves\r\nentering beneath that shadow, conversation passed to an involuntary\r\ngesture, more explicit with him, significant of the prohibited, though\r\nnot acknowledging it.\r\n\r\nAll the stronger was it Victor’s purpose, leaping in his fashion to the\r\ncover of action as an escape from perplexity, to burn and scheme for\r\nthe wedding of their girl--the safe wedding of that dearest, to have her\r\nprotected, secure, with the world warm about her. And he well knew why\r\nhis Nataly had her look of a closed vault (threatening, if opened, to\r\nthunder upon Life) when he dropped his further hints. He chose to call\r\nit feminine inconsistency, in a woman who walked abroad with a basket\r\nof marriage-ties for the market on her arm. He knew that she would soon\r\nhave to speak the dark words to their girl; and the idea of any doing\r\nof it, caught at his throat. Reasonably she dreaded the mother’s task;\r\npardonably indeed. But it is for the mother to do, with a girl. He\r\ndeputed it lightly to the mother because he could see himself stating\r\nthe facts to a son. ‘And, my dear boy, you will from this day draw your\r\nfive thousand a year, and we double it on the day of your marriage,\r\nliving at Lakelands or where you will.’\r\n\r\nHis desire for his girl’s protection by the name of one of our great\r\nFamilies, urged him to bind Nataly to the fact, with the argument, that\r\nit was preferable for the girl to hear their story during her green\r\nearly youth, while she reposed her beautiful blind faith in the\r\ndiscretion of her parents, and as an immediate step to the placing of\r\nher hand in a husband’s. He feared that her mother required schooling\r\nto tell the story vindicatingly and proudly, in a manner to distinguish\r\ninstead of degrading or temporarily seeming to accept degradation.\r\n\r\nThe world would weigh on her confession of the weight of the world on\r\nher child; she would want inciting and strengthening, if one judged of\r\nher capacity to meet the trial by her recent bearing; and how was he\r\nto do it! He could not imagine himself encountering the startled,\r\ntremulous, nascent intelligence in those pure brown darklashed eyes of\r\nNesta; he pitied the poor mother. Fancifully directing her to say this\r\nand that to the girl, his tongue ran till it was cut from his heart and\r\nleft to wag dead colourless words.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of a similar business of exposition, certainly devolving\r\nupon the father in treaty with the fortunate youth, gripped at his\r\nvitals a minute, so intense was his pride in appearing woundless and\r\nscarless, a shining surface, like pure health’s, in the sight of men.\r\nNevertheless he skimmed the story, much as a lecturer strikes his wand\r\non the prominent places of a map, that is to show us how he arrived\r\nat the principal point, which we are all agreed to find chiefly\r\ninteresting. This with Victor was the naming of Nesta’s bridal\r\nendowment. He rushed to it. ‘My girl will have ten thousand a year\r\nsettled on her the day of her marriage.’ Choice of living at Lakelands\r\nwas offered.\r\n\r\nIt helped him over the unpleasant part of that interview. At the\r\nsame time, it moved him to a curious contempt of the youth. He had\r\nto conjure-up an image of the young man in person, to correct the\r\nsentiment:--and it remained as a kind of bruise only half cured.\r\n\r\nMr. Dudley Sowerby was not one of the youths whose presence would\r\nrectify such an abstract estimate of the genus pursuer. He now came\r\nfrequently of an evening, to practise a duet for flutes with Victor;--a\r\nMercadante, honeyed and flowing; too honeyed to suit a style that, as\r\nFenellan characterized it to Nataly, went through the music somewhat\r\nlike an inquisitive tourist in a foreign town, conscientious to get to\r\nthe end of the work of pleasure; until the notes had become familiar,\r\nwhen it rather resembled a constable’s walk along the midnight streets\r\ninto collision with a garlanded roysterer; and the man of order and\r\nthe man of passion, true to the measure though they were, seeming to\r\ndissent, almost to wrangle, in their different ways of winding out the\r\nmelody, on to the last movement; which was plainly a question between\r\nhome to the strayed reveller’s quarters or off to the lockup. Victor was\r\naltogether the younger of the two. But his vehement accompaniment was\r\na tutorship; Mr. Sowerby improved; it was admitted by Nesta and\r\nmademoiselle that he gained a show of feeling; he had learnt that\r\nfeeling was wanted. Passion, he had not a notion of: otherwise he would\r\nnot be delaying; the interview, dramatized by the father of the young\r\nbud of womanhood, would be taking place, and the entry into Lakelands\r\ncalculable, for Nataly’s comfort, as under the aegis of the Cantor\r\nearldom. Gossip flies to a wider circle round the members of a great\r\ntitled family, is inaudible; or no longer the diptherian whisper the\r\ncommonalty hear of the commonalty: and so we see the social uses of our\r\naristocracy survive. We do not want the shield of any family; it is the\r\nsituation that wants it; Nataly ought to be awake to the fact. One blow\r\nand we have silenced our enemy: Nesta’s wedding-day has relieved her\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nVictor’s thoughts upon the instrument for striking that, blow, led him\r\nto suppose Mr. Sowerby might be meditating on the extent of the young\r\nlady’s fortune. He talked randomly of money, in a way to shatter\r\nNataly’s conception of him. He talked of City affairs at table, as it\r\nhad been his practice to shun the doing; and hit the resounding note\r\non mines, which have risen in the market like the crest of a serpent,\r\ncasting a certain spell upon the mercantile understanding. ‘Fredi’s\r\ndiamonds from her own mine, or what once was--and she still reserves a\r\nshare,’ were to be shown to Mr. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nNataly respected the young fellow for not displaying avidity at the\r\nflourish of the bait, however it might be affecting him; and she fancied\r\nthat he did laboriously, in his way earnestly, study her girl, to sound\r\nfor harmony between them, previous to a wooing. She was a closer reader\r\nof social character than Victor; from refraining to run on the broad\r\nlines which are but faintly illustrative of the individual one in\r\nbeing common to all--unless we have hit by chance on an example of the\r\ndownright in roguery or folly or simple goodness. Mr. Sowerby’g bearing\r\nto Nesta was hardly warmed by the glitter of diamonds. His next visit\r\nshowed him livelier in courtliness, brighter, fresher; but that was\r\nalways his way at the commencement of every visit, as if his reflections\r\non the foregone had come to a satisfactory conclusion; and the labours\r\nof the new study of the maiden ensued again in due course to deaden him.\r\n\r\nGentleman he was. In the recognition of his quality as a man of\r\nprinciple and breeding, Nataly was condemned by thoughts of Nesta’s\r\nfuture to question whether word or act of hers should, if inclination\r\non both sides existed, stand between her girl and a true gentleman.\r\nShe counselled herself, as if the counsel were in requisition, to be\r\npassive; and so doing, she more acutely than Victor--save in his chance\r\nflashes--discerned the twist of her very nature caused by their false\r\nposition. And her panacea for ills, the lost little cottage, would not\r\nhave averted it: she would there have had the same coveting desire to\r\nname a man of breeding, honour, station, for Nesta’s husband. Perhaps in\r\nthe cottage, choosing at leisure, her consent to see the brilliant young\r\ncreature tied to the best of dull men would have been unready, without\r\nthe girl to push it. For the Hon. Dudley was lamentably her pupil in\r\nliveliness; he took the second part, as it is painful for a woman\r\nwith the old-fashioned ideas upon the leading of the sexes to behold;\r\nresembling in his look the deaf, who constantly require to have an\r\nobservation repeated; resembling the most intelligent of animals, which\r\nwe do not name, and we reprove ourselves for seeing likeness.\r\n\r\nYet the likeness or apparent likeness would suggest that we have not so\r\nmuch to fear upon the day of the explanation to him. Some gain is there.\r\nShameful thought! Nataly hastened her mind to gather many instances or\r\nindications testifying to the sterling substance in young Mr. Sowerby,\r\nsuch as a mother would pray for her son-in-law to possess. She\r\ndiscovered herself feeling as the burdened mother, not providently for\r\nher girl, in the choice of a mate. The perception was clear, and not the\r\nless did she continue working at the embroidery of Mr. Sowerby on the\r\nbasis of his excellent moral foundations, all the while hoping, praying,\r\nthat he might not be lured on to the proposal for Nesta. But her\r\nsubservience to the power of the persuasive will in Victor--which was\r\nlike the rush of a conflagration--compelled her to think realizingly of\r\nany scheme he allowed her darkly to read.\r\n\r\nOpposition to him, was comparable to the stand of blocks of timber\r\nbefore flame. Colney Durance had done her the mischief we take from the\r\npessimist when we are overweighted: in darkening the vision of external\r\naid from man or circumstance to one who felt herself mastered. Victor\r\ncould make her treacherous to her wishes, in revolt against them, though\r\nthe heart protested. His first conquest of her was in her blood, to\r\nweaken a spirit of resistance. For the precedent of submission is a\r\ncharm upon the faint-hearted through love: it unwinds, unwills them.\r\nNataly resolved fixedly, that there must be a day for speaking; and\r\nshe had her moral sustainment in the resolve; she had also a tormenting\r\nconsciousness of material support in the thought, that the day was\r\nnot present, was possibly distant, might never arrive. Would Victor’s\r\nrelease come sooner? And that was a prospect bearing resemblance to\r\nhopes of the cure of a malady through a sharp operation.\r\n\r\nThese were matters going on behind the curtain; as wholly vital to her,\r\nand with him at times almost as dominant, as the spiritual in memory,\r\nwhen flesh has left but its shining track in dust of a soul outwritten;\r\nand all their talk related to the purchase of furniture, the expeditions\r\nto Lakelands, music, public affairs, the pardonable foibles of\r\nfriends created to amuse their fellows, operatic heroes and heroines,\r\nexhibitions of pictures, the sorrows of Crowned Heads, so serviceable\r\never to mankind as an admonition to the ambitious, a salve to the\r\nenvious!--in fine, whatsoever can entertain or affect the most social\r\nof couples, domestically without a care to appearance. And so far they\r\npartially--dramatically--deceived themselves by imposing on the world\r\nwhile they talked and duetted; for the purchase of furniture from a\r\nflowing purse is a cheerful occupation; also a City issuing out of\r\nhospital, like this poor City of London, inspires good citizens to\r\nhealthy activity. But the silence upon what they were most bent on, had\r\nthe sinister effect upon Victor, of obscuring his mental hold of the\r\nbeloved woman, drifting her away from him. In communicating Fenellan’s\r\nnews through the lawyer Carling of Mrs. Burman’s intentions, he was\r\naware that there was an obstacle to his being huggingly genial,\r\neven candidly genial with her, until he could deal out further\r\nnews, corroborative and consecutive, to show the action of things as\r\nprogressive. Fenellan had sunk into his usual apathy:--and might plead\r\nthe impossibility of his moving faster than the woman professing to\r\ntransform herself into, beneficence out of malignity;--one could\r\nhear him saying the words! Victor had not seen him since last Concert\r\nevening, and he deemed it as well to hear the words Fenellan’s mouth\r\nhad to say. He called at an early hour of the Westward tidal flow at the\r\nInsurance Office looking over the stormy square of the first of Seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE LATEST OF MRS. BURMAN\r\n\r\nAfter cursory remarks about the business of the Office and his friend’s\r\ncontributions to periodical literature, in which he was interested for\r\nas long as he had assurance that the safe income depending upon official\r\nduties was not endangered by them, Victor kicked his heels to and fro.\r\nFenellan waited for him to lead.\r\n\r\n‘Have you seen that man, her lawyer, again?’\r\n\r\n‘I have dined with Mr. Carling:--capital claret.’\r\n\r\nEmptiness was in the reply.\r\n\r\nVictor curbed himself and said: ‘By the way, you’re not likely to have\r\ndealings with Blathenoy. The fellow has a screw to the back of a shifty\r\neye; I see it at work to fix the look for business. I shall sit on the\r\nBoard of my Bank. One hears things. He lives in style at Wrensham. By\r\nthe way, Fredi has little Mab Mountney from Creckholt staying with her.\r\nYou said of little Mabsy--“Here she comes into the room all pink and\r\nwhite, like a daisy.” She’s the daisy still; reminds us of our girl at\r\nthat age.--So, then, we come to another dead block!’\r\n\r\n‘Well, no; it’s a chemist’s shop, if that helps us on,’ said Fenellan,\r\nsettling to a new posture in his chair. ‘She’s there of an afternoon for\r\nhours.’\r\n\r\n‘You mean it’s she?’\r\n\r\n‘The lady. I ‘ll tell you. I have it from Carling, worthy man; and\r\nlawyers can be brought to untruss a point over a cup of claret. He’s a\r\nbit of a “Mackenzie Man,” as old aunts of mine used to say at home--a\r\nMan of Feeling. Thinks he knows the world, from having sifted and sorted\r\na lot of our dustbins; as the modern Realists imagine it’s an exposition\r\nof positive human nature when they’ve pulled down our noses to the worst\r\nparts--if there’s a worse where all are useful: but the Realism of the\r\ndogs is to have us by the nose:--excite it and befoul it, and you’re\r\nfearfully credible! You don’t read that olfactory literature. However,\r\nfriend Carling is a conciliatory carle. Three or four days of the week\r\nthe lady, he says, drives to her chemist’s, and there she sits in the\r\nshop; round the corner, as you enter; and sees all Charing in the shop\r\nlooking-glass at the back; herself a stranger spectacle, poor lady, if\r\nCarling’s picture of her is not overdone; with her fashionable no-bonnet\r\nstriding the contribution chignon on the crown, and a huge square green\r\nshade over her forehead. Sits hours long, and cocks her ears at orders\r\nof applicants for drugs across the counter, and sometimes catches wind\r\nof a prescription, and consults her chemist, and thinks she ‘ll try\r\nit herself. It’s a basket of medicine bottles driven to Regent’s Park\r\npretty well every day.’\r\n\r\n‘Ha! Regent’s Park!’ exclaimed Victor, and shook at recollections of the\r\ndistrict and the number of the house, dismal to him. London buried\r\nthe woman deep until a mention of her sent her flaring over London. ‘A\r\nchemist’s shop! She sits there?’\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Burman. We pass by the shop.’\r\n\r\n‘She had always a turn for drugs.--Not far from here, did you say? And\r\nevery day! under a green shade?’\r\n\r\n‘Dear fellow, don’t be suggesting ballads; we’ll go now,’ said Fenellan.\r\n‘It ‘s true it’s like sitting on the banks of the Stygian waters.’\r\n\r\nHe spied at an obsequious watch, that told him it was time to quit the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n‘You’ve done nothing?’ Victor asked in a tone of no expectation.\r\n\r\n‘Only to hear that her latest medical man is Themison.’\r\n\r\n‘Where did you hear?’\r\n\r\n‘Across the counter of Boyle and Luckwort, the lady’s chemists. I\r\ncalled the day before yesterday, after you were here at our last Board\r\nMeeting.’\r\n\r\n‘The Themison?’\r\n\r\n‘The great Dr. Themison; who kills you kindlier than most, and is much\r\nin request for it.’\r\n\r\n‘There’s one of your echoes of Colney!’ Victor cried. ‘One gets dead\r\nsick of that worn-out old jibeing at doctors. They don’t kill, you know\r\nvery well. It ‘s not to their interest to kill. They may take the relish\r\nout of life; and upon my word, I believe that helps to keep the patient\r\nliving!’\r\n\r\nFenellan sent an eye of discreet comic penetration travelling through\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n‘The City’s mending; it’s not the weary widow woman of the day when we\r\ncapsized the diurnal with your royal Old Veuve,’ he said, as they trod\r\nthe pavement. ‘Funny people, the English! They give you all the primeing\r\npossible for amusement and jollity, and devil a sentry-box for the\r\nexercise of it; and if you shake a leg publicly, partner or not, you’re\r\nmarched off to penitence. I complain, that they have no philosophical\r\nappreciation of human nature.’\r\n\r\n‘We pass the shop?’ Victor interrupted him.\r\n\r\n‘You’re in view of it in a minute. And what a square, for recreative\r\ndancing! And what a people, to be turning it into a place of political\r\nagitation! And what a country, where from morning to night it’s an\r\nendless wrangle about the first conditions of existence! Old Colney\r\nseems right now and then: they ‘re the offspring of pirates, and they\r\n‘ve got the manners and tastes of their progenitors, and the trick of\r\nquarrelling everlastingly over the booty. I ‘d have band-music here for\r\na couple of hours, three days of the week at the least; and down in the\r\nEast; and that forsaken North quarter of London; and the Baptist South\r\ntoo. But just as those omnibus-wheels are the miserable music of this\r\nLondon of ours, it ‘s only too sadly true that the people are in the\r\nfirst rumble of the notion of the proper way to spend their lives. Now\r\nyou see the shop: Boyle and Luckwort: there.’\r\n\r\nVictor looked. He threw his coat open, and pulled the waistcoat, and\r\nswelled it, ahemming. ‘That shop?’ said he. And presently: ‘Fenellan,\r\nI’m not superstitious, I think. Now listen; I declare to you, on the day\r\nof our drinking Old Veuve together last--you remember it,--I walked\r\nhome up this way across the square, and I was about to step into that\r\nidentical shop, for some household prescription in my pocket, having\r\nforgotten Nataly’s favourite City chemists Fenbird and Jay, when--I’m\r\nstating a fact--I distinctly--I ‘m sure of the shop--felt myself plucked\r\nback by the elbow; pulled back the kind of pull when you have to put a\r\nfoot backward to keep your equilibrium.’\r\n\r\nSo does memory inspired by the sensations contribute an additional item\r\nfor the colouring of history.\r\n\r\nHe touched the elbow, showed a flitting face of crazed amazement in\r\namusement, and shrugged and half-laughed, dismissing the incident, as\r\nbeing perhaps, if his hearer chose to have it so, a gem of the rubbish\r\ntumbled into the dustcart out of a rather exceptional householder’s\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nFenellan smiled indulgently. ‘Queer things happen. I recollect reading\r\nin my green youth of a clergyman, who mounted a pulpit of the port where\r\nhe was landed after his almost solitary rescue from a burning ship at\r\nmidnight in mid-sea, to inform his congregation, that he had overnight\r\nof the catastrophe a personal Warning right in his ear from a Voice,\r\nwhen at his bed or bunk-side, about to perform the beautiful ceremony of\r\nundressing: and the Rev. gentleman was to lie down in his full uniform,\r\nnot so much as to relieve himself of his boots, the Voice insisted\r\ntwice; and he obeyed it, despite the discomfort to his poor feet; and\r\nhe jumped up in his boots to the cry of Fire, and he got them\r\nprovidentially over the scuffling deck straight at the first rush into\r\nthe boat awaiting them, and had them safe on and polished the day he\r\npreached the sermon of gratitude for the special deliverance. There was\r\na Warning! and it might well be called, as he called it, from within.\r\nWe’re cared for, never doubt. Aide-toi. Be ready dressed to help\r\nyourself in a calamity, or you’ll not stand in boots at your next\r\nSermon, contrasting with the burnt. That sounds like the moral.’\r\n\r\n‘She could have seen me,’ Victor threw out an irritable suggestion. The\r\nidea of the recent propinquity set hatred in motion.\r\n\r\n‘Scarcely likely. I’m told she sits looking on her lap, under the\r\nbeetling shade, until she hears an order for tinctures or powders, or a\r\nmixture that strikes her fancy. It’s possible to do more suicidal things\r\nthan sit the afternoons in a chemist’s shop and see poor creatures get\r\ntheir different passports to Orcus.’\r\n\r\nVictor stepped mutely beneath the windows of the bellied glass-urns of\r\nchemical wash. The woman might be inside there now! She might have\r\nseen his figure in the shop-mirror! And she there! The wonder of it all\r\nseemed to be, that his private history was not walking the streets.\r\nThe thinness of the partition concealing it, hardly guaranteed a day’s\r\nimmunity: because this woman would live in London, in order to have\r\nher choice of a central chemist’s shop, where she could feed a ghastly\r\nimagination on the various recipes... and while it would have been so\r\nmuch healthier for her to be living in a recess of the country!\r\n\r\nHe muttered: ‘Diseases--drugs!’\r\n\r\nThose were the corresponding two strokes of the pendulum which kept the\r\nwoman going.\r\n\r\n‘And deadly spite.’ That was the emanation of the monotonous horrible\r\nconflict, for which, and by which, the woman lived.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the shop, he could not but think of her through\r\nthe feelings of a man scorched by a furnace.\r\n\r\nA little further on, he said: ‘Poor soul!’ He confessed to himself, that\r\nlatterly he had, he knew not why, been impatient with her, rancorous\r\nin thought, as never before. He had hitherto aimed at a picturesque\r\ntolerance of her vindictiveness; under suffering, both at Craye and\r\nCreckholt; and he had been really forgiving. He accused her of dragging\r\nhim down to humanity’s lowest.\r\n\r\nBut if she did that, it argued the possession of a power of a sort.\r\n\r\nHer station in the chemist’s shop he passed almost daily, appeared to\r\nhim as a sudden and a terrific rush to the front; though it was only a\r\nshort drive from the house in Regent’s Park; but having shaken-off\r\nthat house, he had pushed it back into mists, obliterated it. The woman\r\ncertainly had a power.\r\n\r\nHe shot away to the power he knew of in himself; his capacity for\r\nwinning men in bodies, the host of them, when it came to an effort of\r\nhis energies: men and, individually, women. Individually, the women were\r\nto be counted on as well; warm supporters.\r\n\r\nIt was the admission of a doubt that he might expect to enroll them\r\ncollectively. Eyeing the men, he felt his command of them. Glancing at\r\ncongregated women, he had a chill. The Wives and Spinsters in ghostly\r\njudicial assembly: that is, the phantom of the offended collective\r\nwoman: that is, the regnant Queen Idea issuing from our concourse of\r\ncivilized life to govern Society, and pronounce on the orderly, the\r\ntolerable, the legal, and banish the rebellious: these maintained an\r\naspect of the stand against him.\r\n\r\nDid Nataly read the case: namely, that the crowned collective woman is\r\nnot to be subdued? And what are we to say of the indefinite but forcible\r\nAuthority, when we see it upholding Mrs. Burman to crush a woman like\r\nNataly!\r\n\r\nVictor’s novel exercises in reflection were bringing him by hard degrees\r\nto conceive it to be the impalpable which has prevailing weight. Not\r\nmany of our conquerors have scored their victories on the road of that\r\nindex: nor has duration been granted them to behold the minute measure\r\nof value left even tangible after the dust of the conquest subsides.\r\nThe passing by a shop where a broken old woman might be supposed to\r\nsit beneath her green forehead-shade--Venetian-blind of a\r\nhenbane-visage!--had precipitated him into his first real grasp of the\r\nabstract verity: and it opens on to new realms, which are a new world\r\nto the practical mind. But he made no advance. He stopped in a fever of\r\nsensibility, to contemplate the powerful formless vapour rolling from a\r\nsource that was nothing other than yonder weak lonely woman.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the human nature of the man was dragged to the school\r\nof its truancy by circumstances, for him to learn the commonest of sums\r\ndone on a slate, in regard to payment of debts and the unrelaxing grip\r\nof the creditor on the defaulter. Debtors are always paying like those\r\nwho are guilty of the easiest thing in life, the violation of Truth,\r\nthey have made themselves bondmen to pay, if not in substance, then in\r\nsoul; and the nipping of the soul goes on for as long as the concrete\r\nburden is undischarged. You know the Liar; you must have seen him\r\ndiminishing, until he has become a face without features, withdrawn to\r\nhumanity’s preliminary sketch (some half-dozen frayed threads of woeful\r\noutline on our original tapestry-web); and he who did the easiest of\r\nthings, he must from such time sweat in being the prodigy of inventive\r\nnimbleness, up to the day when he propitiates Truth by telling it\r\nagain. There is a repentance that does reconstitute! It may help to the\r\ntraceing to springs of a fable whereby men have been guided thus far out\r\nof the wood.\r\n\r\nVictor would have said truly that he loved Truth; that he paid every\r\ndebt with a scrupulous exactitude: money, of course; and prompt\r\napologies for a short brush of his temper. Nay, he had such a conscience\r\nfor the smallest eruptions of a transient irritability, that the wish\r\nto say a friendly mending word to the Punctilio donkey of London Bridge,\r\nsoftened his retrospective view of the fall there, more than once.\r\nAlthough this man was a presentation to mankind of the force in Nature\r\nwhich drives to unresting speed, which is the vitality of the heart seen\r\nat its beating after a plucking of it from the body, he knew himself for\r\nthe reverse of lawless; he inclined altogether to good citizenship.\r\nSo social a man could not otherwise incline. But when it came to the\r\nexamination of accounts between Mrs. Burman and himself, spasms of\r\nphysical revulsion, loathings, his excessive human nature, put her out\r\nof Court. To men, it was impossible for him to speak the torments of\r\nthose days of the monstrous alliance. The heavens were cognizant. He\r\npleaded his case in their accustomed hearing:--a youngster tempted by\r\nwealth, attracted, besought, snared, revolted, etc. And Mrs. Burman,\r\nwhen roused to jealousy, had shown it by teazing him for a confession of\r\nhis admiration of splendid points in the beautiful Nataly, the priceless\r\nfair woman living under their roof, a contrast of very life, with the\r\ncorpse and shroud; and she seen by him daily, singing with him, her\r\nbreath about him, her voice incessantly upon every chord of his being!\r\n\r\nHe pleaded successfully. But the silence following the verdict was\r\nheavy; the silence contained an unheard thunder. It was the sound, as\r\nwhen out of Court the public is dissatisfied with a verdict. Are we\r\nexpected to commit a social outrage in exposing our whole case to the\r\npublic?--Imagine it for a moment as done. Men are ours at a word--or at\r\nleast a word of invitation. Women we woo; fluent smooth versions of our\r\ntortures, mixed with permissible courtship, win the individual woman.\r\nAnd that unreasoning collective woman, icy, deadly, condemns the\r\npoor racked wretch who so much as remembers them! She is the enemy of\r\nNature.--Tell us how? She is the slave of existing conventions.--And\r\nfrom what cause? She is the artificial production of a state that exalts\r\nher so long as she sacrifices daily and hourly to the artificial.\r\n\r\nTherefore she sides with Mrs. Burman--the foe of Nature: who, with\r\nher arts and gold lures, has now possession of the Law (the brass idol\r\nworshipped by the collective) to drive Nature into desolation.\r\n\r\nHe placed himself to the right of Mrs. Burman, for the world to behold\r\nthe couple: and he lent the world a sigh of disgust.\r\n\r\nWhat he could not do, as in other matters he did, was to rise above the\r\nsituation, in a splendid survey and rapid view of the means of reversing\r\nit. He was too social to be a captain of the socially insurgent;\r\nimagination expired.\r\n\r\nBut having a courageous Nataly to second him!--how then? It was the\r\nsuccour needed. Then he would have been ready to teach the world that\r\nNature--honest Nature--is more to be prized than Convention: a new Era\r\nmight begin.\r\n\r\nThe thought was tonic for an instant and illuminated him springingly. It\r\nsank, excused for the flaccidity by Nataly’s want of common adventurous\r\ndaring. She had not taken to Lakelands; she was purchasing furniture\r\nfrom a flowing purse with a heavy heart--unfeminine, one might say; she\r\npreferred to live obscurely; she did not, one had to think--but it\r\nwas unjust: and yet the accusation, that she did not cheerfully make a\r\nstrain and spurt on behalf of her child, pressed to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThese short glimpses at reflection in Victor were like the verberant\r\ntwang of a musical instrument that has had a smart blow, and wails away\r\nindependent of the player’s cunning hand. He would have said, that he\r\nwas more his natural self when the cunning hand played on him, to make\r\nhim praise and uplift his beloved: mightily would it have astonished him\r\nto contemplate with assured perception in his own person the Nature he\r\ninvoked. But men invoking Nature, do not find in her the Holy Mother she\r\nin such case becomes to her daughters, whom she so persecutes. Men call\r\non her for their defence, as a favourable witness: she is a note of\r\ntheir rhetoric. They are not bettered by her sustainment; they have not,\r\nas women may have, her enaemic aid at a trying hour. It is not an effort\r\nat epigram to say, that whom she scourges most she most supports.\r\n\r\nAn Opera-placard drew his next remark to Fenellan.\r\n\r\n‘How Wagner seems to have stricken the Italians! Well, now, the Germans\r\nhave their Emperor to head their armies, and I say that the German\r\nemperor has done less for their lasting fame and influence than Wagner\r\nhas done. He has affected the French too; I trace him in Gounod’s Romeo\r\net Juliette--and we don’t gain by it; we have a poor remuneration for\r\nthe melody gone; think of the little shepherd’s pipeing in Mireille; and\r\nthere’s another in Sapho-delicious. I held out against Wagner as long as\r\nI could. The Italians don’t much more than Wagnerize in exchange for\r\nthe loss of melody. They would be wiser in going back to Pergolese,\r\nCampagnole. The Mefistofole was good--of the school of the foreign\r\nmaster. Aida and Otello, no. I confess to a weakness for the old\r\nbarleysugar of Bellini or a Donizetti-Serenade. Aren’t you seduced by\r\ncadences? Never mind Wagner’s tap of his paedagogue’s baton--a cadence\r\ncatches me still. Early taste for barley-sugar, perhaps! There’s a march\r\nin Verdi’s Attila and I Lombardi, I declare I’m in military step when\r\nI hear them, as in the old days, after leaving the Opera. Fredi takes\r\nlittle Mab Mountney to her first Opera to-night. Enough to make us old\r\nones envious! You remember your first Opera, Fenellan? Sonnambula, with\r\nme. I tell you, it would task the highest poetry--say, require, if\r\nyou like--showing all that’s noblest, splendidest, in a young man, to\r\ndescribe its effect on me. I was dreaming of my box at the Opera for\r\na year after. The Huguenots to-night. Not the best suited for little\r\nMabsy; but she’ll catch at the Rataplan. Capital Opera; we used to\r\nthink it the best, before we had Tannhauser and Lohengrin and the\r\nMeistersinger.’\r\n\r\nVictor hinted notes of the Conspiration Scene closing the Third Act of\r\nthe Huguenots. That sombre Chorus brought Mrs. Burman before him. He\r\ndrummed the Rataplan, which sent her flying. The return of a lively\r\ndisposition for dinner and music completed his emancipation from the\r\nyoke of the baleful creature sitting half her days in the chemist’s\r\nshop; save that a thought of drugs brought the smell, and the smell the\r\npicture; she threatened to be an apparition at any moment pervading him\r\nthrough his nostrils. He spoke to Fenellan of hunger for dinner, a need\r\nfor it; singular in one whose appetite ran to the stroke of the hour\r\nabreast with Armandine’s kitchen-clock. Fenellan proposed a glass of\r\nsherry and bitters at his Club over the way. He had forgotten a shower\r\nof black-balls (attributable to the conjurations of old Ate) on\r\na certain past day. Without word of refusal, Victor entered a\r\nwine-merchant’s office, where he was unknown, and stating his wish for\r\nbitters and dry sherry, presently received the glass, drank, nodded\r\nto the administering clerk, named the person whom he had obliged and\r\nrefreshed, and passed out, remarking to Fenellan: ‘Colney on Clubs! he’s\r\nright; they’re the mediaeval in modern times, our Baron’s castles, minus\r\nthe Baron; dead against public life and social duties. Business excuses\r\nmy City Clubs; but I shall take my name off my Club up West.’\r\n\r\n‘More like monasteries, with a Committee for Abbot, and Whist for\r\nthe services,’ Fenellan said. ‘Or tabernacles for the Chosen, and\r\nGrangousier playing Divinity behind the veil. Well, they’re social.’\r\n\r\n‘Sectionally social, means anything but social, my friend. However--and\r\nthe monastery had a bell for the wanderer! Say, I’m penniless or\r\npoundless, up and down this walled desert of a street, I feel, I must\r\nfeel, these palaces--if we’re Christian, not Jews: not that the Jews are\r\nuncharitable; they set an: example, in fact....’\r\n\r\nHe rambled, amusingly to the complacent hearing of Fenellan, who thought\r\nof his pursuit of wealth and grand expenditure.\r\n\r\nVictor talked as a man having his mind at leaps beyond the subject. He\r\nwas nearing to the Idea he had seized and lost on London Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe desire for some good news wherewith to inspirit Nataly, withdrew him\r\nfrom his ineffectual chase. He had nought to deliver; on the contrary,\r\na meditation concerning her comfort pledged him to concealment which was\r\nthe no step, or passive state, most abhorrent to him.\r\n\r\nHe snatched at the name of Themison.\r\n\r\nWith Dr. Themison fast in his grasp, there was a report of progress to\r\nbe made to Nataly; and not at all an empty report.\r\n\r\nThemison, then: he leaned on Themison. The woman’s doctor should have an\r\ninfluence approaching to authority with her.\r\n\r\nLand-values in the developing Colonies, formed his theme of discourse to\r\nFenellan: let Banks beware.\r\n\r\nFenellan saw him shudder and rub the back of his head. ‘Feel the wind?’\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nVictor answered him with that humane thrill of the deep tones, which at\r\ntimes he had: ‘No: don’t be alarmed; I feel the devil. If one has wealth\r\nand a desperate wish, he will speak. All he does, is to make me more\r\ncharitable to those who give way to him. I believe in a devil.’\r\n\r\n‘Horns and tail?’\r\n\r\n‘Bait and hook.’\r\n\r\n‘I haven’t wealth, and I wish only for dinner,’ Fenellan said.\r\n\r\n‘You know that Armandine is never two minutes late. By the way, you\r\nhaven’t wealth--you have me.’\r\n\r\n‘And I thank God for you!’ said Fenellan, acutely reminiscent of his\r\nhaving marked the spiritual adviser of Mrs. Burman, the Rev. Groseman\r\nButtermore, as a man who might be useful to his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. DISCLOSES A STAGE ON THE DRIVE TO PARIS\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, an extremely disconcerting circumstance occurred:\r\nArmandine was ten minutes behind the hour with her dinner. But the\r\nsurprise and stupefaction expressed by Victor, after glances at\r\nhis watch, were not so profound as Fenellan’s, on finding himself\r\nexchangeing the bow with a gentleman bearing the name of Dr. Themison.\r\nHis friend’s rapidity in pushing the combinations he conceived, was\r\nknown: Fenellan’s wonder was not so much that Victor had astonished\r\nhim again, as that he should be called upon again to wonder at his\r\nastonishment. He did; and he observed the doctor and Victor and Nataly:\r\naided by dropping remarks. Before the evening was over, he gathered\r\nenough of the facts, and had to speculate only on the designs. Dr.\r\nThemison had received a visit from the husband of Mrs. Victor Radnor\r\nconcerning her state of health. At an interview with the lady, laughter\r\ngreeted him; he was confused by her denial of the imputation of a single\r\nailment: but she, to recompose him, let it be understood, that she was\r\nanxious about her husband’s condition, he being certainly overworked;\r\nand the husband’s visit passed for a device on the part of the wife. She\r\nadmitted a willingness to try a change of air, if it was deemed good\r\nfor her husband. Change of air was prescribed to each for both. ‘Why not\r\ndrive to Paris?’ the doctor said, and Victor was taken with the phrase.\r\n\r\nHe told Fenellan at night that Mrs. Burman, he had heard, was by\r\nthe sea, on the South coast. Which of her maladies might be in the\r\nascendant, he did not know. He knew little. He fancied that Dr. Themison\r\nwas unsuspicious of the existence of a relationship between him and Mrs.\r\nBurman: and Fenellan opined, that there had been no communication upon\r\nprivate affairs. What, then, was the object in going to Dr. Themison? He\r\ntreated her body merely; whereas the Rev. Groseman Buttermore could\r\nbe expected to impose upon her conduct. Fenellan appreciated his own\r\ndiscernment of the superior uses to which a spiritual adviser may\r\nbe put, and he too agreeably flattered himself for the corrective\r\nreflection to ensue, that he had not done anything. It disposed him\r\nto think a happy passivity more sagacious than a restless activity.\r\nWe should let Fortune perform her part at the wheel in working out her\r\nends, should we not?--for, ten to one, nine times out of ten we are\r\nthwarting her if we stretch out a hand. And with the range of enjoyments\r\npossessed by Victor, why this unceasing restlessness? Why, when we are\r\nnot near drowning, catch at apparent straws, which may be instruments\r\nhaving sharp edges? Themison, as Mrs. Burman’s medical man, might tell\r\nthe lady tales that would irritate her bag of venom.\r\n\r\nRarely though Fenellan was the critic on his friend, the shadow cast\r\nover his negligent hedonism by Victor’s boiling pressure, drove him\r\ninto the seat of judgement. As a consequence, he was rather a dull\r\ntable-guest in the presence of Dr. Themison, whom their host had pricked\r\nto anticipate high entertainment from him. He did nothing to bridge the\r\ncrevasse and warm the glacier air at table when the doctor, anecdotal\r\nintentionally to draw him out, related a decorous but pungent story of\r\none fair member of a sweet new sisterhood in agitation against the fixed\r\nestablishment of our chain-mail marriage-tie. An anecdote of immediate\r\ndiversion was wanted, expected: and Fenellan sat stupidly speculating\r\nupon whether the doctor knew of a cupboard locked. So that Dr. Themison\r\nwas carried on by Lady Grace Halley’s humourous enthusiasm for the\r\nsubject to dilate and discuss and specify, all in the irony of a\r\njudicial leaning to the side of the single-minded social adventurers,\r\nunder an assumed accord with his audience; concluding: ‘So there’s an\r\nend of Divorce.’\r\n\r\n‘By the trick of multiplication,’ Fenellan, now reassured, was content\r\nto say. And that did not extinguish the cracker of a theme; handled very\r\ncarefully, as a thing of fire, it need scarce be remarked, three young\r\nwomen being present.\r\n\r\nNataly had eyes on her girl, and was pleased at an alertness shown by\r\nMr. Sowerby to second her by crossing the dialogue. As regarded her\r\npersonal feelings, she was hardened, so long as the curtains were about\r\nher to keep the world from bending black brows of inquisition upon one\r\nof its culprits. But her anxiety was vigilant to guard her girl from\r\nan infusion of any of the dread facts of life not coming through the\r\nmother’s lips: and she was a woman having the feminine mind’s pudency\r\nin that direction, which does not consent to the revealing of much. Here\r\nwas the mother’s dilemma: her girl--Victor’s girl, as she had to think\r\nin this instance,--the most cloudless of the young women of earth,\r\nseemed, and might be figured as really, at the falling of a crumb off\r\nthe table of knowledge, taken by the brain to shoot up to terrific\r\nheights of surveyal; and there she rocked; and only her youthful\r\nhealthiness brought her down to grass and flowers. She had once or twice\r\nreceived the electrical stimulus, to feel and be as lightning, from a\r\nseizure of facts in infinitesimal doses, guesses caught off maternal\r\nevasions or the circuitous explanation of matters touching sex in here\r\nand there a newspaper, harder to repress completely than sewer-gas in\r\ngreat cities: and her mother had seen, with an apprehensive pang of\r\nanguish, how witheringly the scared young intelligence of the innocent\r\ncreature shocked her sensibility. She foresaw the need to such a\r\nflameful soul, as bride, wife, woman across the world, of the very\r\nprinceliest of men in gifts of strength, for her sustainer and guide.\r\nAnd the provident mother knew this peerless gentleman: but he had his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nDelusions and the pain of the disillusioning were to be feared for the\r\nimaginative Nesta; though not so much as that on some future day of a\r\nperchance miserable yokemating--a subjection or an entanglement--the\r\nnobler passions might be summoned to rise for freedom, and strike a line\r\nto make their logically estimable sequence from a source not honourable\r\nbefore the public. Constantly it had to be thought, that the girl was\r\nher father’s child.\r\n\r\nAt present she had no passions; and her bent to the happiness she could\r\nso richly give, had drawn her sailing smoothly over the harbour-bar of\r\nmaidenhood; where many of her sisters are disconcerted to the loss of\r\nsimplicity. If Nataly with her sleepless watchfulness and forecasts\r\npartook of the French mother, Nesta’s Arcadian independence likened her\r\nsomewhat in manner to the Transatlantic version of the English girl. Her\r\nhigh physical animation and the burden of themes it plucked for delivery\r\ncarried her flowing over impediments of virginal self-consciousness, to\r\nset her at her ease in the talk with men; she had not gone through the\r\nvarious Nursery exercises in dissimulation; she had no appearance of\r\npraying forgiveness of men for the original sin of being woman; and no\r\ntricks of lips or lids, or traitor scarlet on the cheeks, or assumptions\r\nof the frigid mask, or indicated reserve-cajoleries. Neither ignorantly\r\nnor advisedly did she play on these or other bewitching strings of her\r\nsex, after the fashion of the stamped innocents, who are the boast\r\nof Englishmen and matrons, and thrill societies with their winsome\r\ningenuousness; and who sometimes when unguarded meet an artful\r\nserenader, that is a cloaked bandit, and is provoked by their\r\nperformances, and knows anthropologically the nature behind the devious\r\nshow; a sciential rascal; as little to be excluded from our modern\r\ncircles as Eve’s own old deuce from Eden’s garden whereupon, opportunity\r\ninviting, both the fool and the cunning, the pure donkey princess of\r\ninsular eulogy, and the sham one, are in a perilous pass.\r\n\r\nDamsels of the swiftness of mind of Nesta cannot be ignorant utterly\r\namid a world where the hints are hourly scattering seed of the inklings;\r\nwhen vileness is not at work up and down our thoroughfares, proclaiming\r\nits existence with tableau and trumpet. Nataly encountered her girl’s\r\nquestions, much as one seeks to quiet an enemy. The questions had soon\r\nceased. Excepting repulsive and rejected details, there is little to\r\nbe learnt when a little is known: in populous communities, density only\r\nwill keep the little out. Only stupidity will suppose that it can be\r\ndone for the livelier young. English mothers forethoughtful for their\r\ngirls, have to take choice of how to do battle with a rough-and-tumble\r\nOld England, that lumbers bumping along, craving the precious things,\r\nwhich can be had but in semblance under the conditions allowed by\r\nlaziness to subsist, and so curst of its shifty inconsequence as to\r\nworship in the concrete an hypocrisy it abhors in the abstract. Nataly\r\ncould smuggle or confiscate here and there a newspaper; she could not\r\ninterdict or withhold every one of them, from a girl ardent to be in\r\nthe race on all topics of popular interest: and the newspapers are\r\noccasionally naked savages; the streets are imperfectly garmented even\r\nby day; and we have our stumbling social anecdotist, our spot-mouthed\r\nyoung man, our eminently silly woman; our slippery one; our slimy one,\r\nthe Rahab of Society; not to speak of Mary the maid and the footman\r\nWilliam. A vigilant mother has to contend with these and the like in an\r\nincreasing degree. How best?\r\n\r\nThere is a method: one that Colney Durance advocated. The girl’s\r\nintelligence and sweet blood invited a trial of it. Since, as he argued,\r\nwe cannot keep the poisonous matter out, mothers should prepare and\r\nstrengthen young women for the encounter with it, by lifting the veil,\r\nbaring the world, giving them knowledge to arm them for the fight they\r\nhave to sustain; and thereby preserve them further from the spiritual\r\ncollapse which follows the nursing of a false ideal of our life in\r\nyouth:--this being, Colney said, the prominent feminine disease of the\r\ntime, common to all our women; that is, all having leisure to shine in\r\nthe sun or wave in the wind as flowers of the garden.\r\n\r\nWhatever there was of wisdom in his view, he spoilt it for English\r\nhearing, by making use of his dry compressed sentences. Besides he was a\r\nbachelor; therefore but a theorist. And his illustrations of his\r\ntheory were grotesque; meditation on them extracted a corrosive acid to\r\nconsume, in horrid derision, the sex, the nation, the race of man. The\r\nsatirist too devotedly loves his lash to be a persuasive teacher. Nataly\r\nhad excuses to cover her reasons for not listening to him.\r\n\r\nOne reason was, as she discerned through her confusion at the thought,\r\nthat the day drew near for her speaking fully to Nesta; when, between\r\nwhat she then said and what she said now, a cruel contrast might strike\r\nthe girl and in toneing revelations now, to be more consonant with\r\nthem then;--in softening and shading the edges of social misconduct, it\r\nseemed painfully possible to be sowing in the girl’s mind something\r\nlike the reverse of moral precepts, even to smoothing the way to a\r\nrebelliousness partly or wholly similar to her own. But Nataly’s chief\r\nand her appeasing reason for pursuing the conventional system with this\r\nexceptional young creature, referred to the sentiments on that subject\r\nof the kind of young man whom a mother elects from among those present\r\nand eligible, as perhaps next to worthy to wed the girl, by virtue of\r\ngood promise in the moral department. She had Mr. Dudley Sowerby under\r\nview; far from the man of her choice and still the practice of decorum,\r\ndiscretion, a pardonable fastidiousness, appears, if women may make any\r\nforecast of the behaviour of young men or may trust the faces they\r\nsee, to, promise a future stability in the husband. Assuredly a Dudley\r\nSowerby would be immensely startled to find in his bride a young woman\r\nmore than babily aware of the existence of one particular form of\r\nnaughtiness on earth.\r\n\r\nVictor was of no help: he had not an idea upon the right education of\r\nthe young of the sex. Repression and mystery, he considered wholesome\r\nfor girls; and he considered the enlightening of them--to some extent--a\r\nprudential measure for their defence; and premature instruction is\r\na fire-water to their wild-in-woods understanding; and histrionic\r\ninnocence is no doubt the bloom on corruption; also the facts of current\r\nhuman life, in the crude of the reports or the cooked of the sermon in\r\nthe newspapers, are a noxious diet for our daughters; whom nevertheless\r\nwe cannot hope to be feeding always on milk: and there is a time when\r\ntheir adorable pretty ignorance, if credibly it exists out of noodledom,\r\nis harmful:--but how beautiful the shining simplicity of our dear young\r\nEnglish girls! He was one of the many men to whose minds women come\r\nin pictures and are accepted much as they paint themselves. Like his\r\nnumerous fellows, too, he required a conflict with them, and a worsting\r\nat it, to be taught, that they are not the mere live stock we scheme to\r\ndispose of for their good: unless Love should interpose, he would have\r\nexclaimed. He broke from his fellows in his holy horror of a father’s\r\nrunning counter to love. Nesta had only to say, that she loved another,\r\nfor Dudley Sowerby to be withdrawn into the background of aspirants. But\r\nlove was unknown to the girl.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, the plan of the Drive to Paris had the look of Victor’s\r\ntraditional hospitality. Nataly smiled at her incorrigibly lagging\r\nintelligence of him, on hearing that he had invited a company: ‘Lady\r\nGrace, for gaiety; Peridon and Catkin, fiddles; Dudley Sowerby and\r\nmyself, flutes; Barmby, intonation; in all, nine of us; and by the dear\r\nold Normandy route, for the sake of the voyage, as in old times; towers\r\nof Dieppe in the morning-light; and the lovely road to the capital! Just\r\nthree days in Paris, and home by any of the other routes. It’s the drive\r\nwe want. Boredom in wet weather, we defy; we have our Concert--an hour\r\nat night and we’re sure of sleep.’ It had a sweet simple air, befitting\r\nhim; as when in bygone days they travelled with the joy of children. For\r\ntravelling shook Nataly out of her troubles and gave her something of\r\nthe child’s inheritance of the wisdom of life--the living ever so little\r\nahead of ourselves; about as far as the fox in view of the hunt. That is\r\nthe soul of us out for novelty, devouring as it runs, an endless feast;\r\nand the body is eagerly after it, recording the pleasures, a daily\r\nchase. Remembrance of them is almost a renewal, anticipation a revival.\r\nShe enraptured Victor with glimpses of the domestic fun she had ceased\r\nto show sign of since the revelation of Lakelands. Her only regret was\r\non account of the exclusion of Colney Durance from the party, because\r\nof happy memories associating him with the Seine-land, and also that\r\nhis bilious criticism of his countrymen was moderated by a trip to the\r\nContinent. Fenellan reported Colney to be ‘busy in the act of distilling\r\none of his Prussic acid essays.’ Fenellan would have jumped to go. He\r\ninformed Victor, as a probe, that the business of the Life Insurance was\r\nat periods ‘fearfully necrological! Inexplicably, he was not invited.\r\nDid it mean, that he was growing dull? He looked inside instead of out,\r\nand lost the clue.\r\n\r\nHis behaviour on the evening of the departure showed plainly what would\r\nhave befallen Mr. Sowerby on the expedition, had not he as well\r\nas Colney been excluded. Two carriages and a cab conveyed the\r\nexcursionists, as they merrily called themselves, to the terminus.\r\nThey were Victor’s guests; they had no trouble, no expense, none of\r\nthe nipper reckonings which dog our pleasures; the state of pure bliss.\r\nFenellan’s enviousness drove him at the Rev. Mr. Barmby until the latter\r\njumped to the seat beside Nesta in her carriage, Mademoiselle de Seilles\r\nand Mr. Sowerby facing them. Lady Grace Halley, in the carriage behind,\r\nheard Nesta’s laugh; which Mr. Barmby had thought vacuous, beseeming\r\nlittle girls, that laugh at nothings. She questioned Fenellan.\r\n\r\n‘Oh,’ said he, ‘I merely mentioned that the Rev. gentleman carries his\r\nmusical instrument at the bottom of his trunk.’\r\n\r\nShe smiled: ‘And who are in the cab?’\r\n\r\n‘Your fiddles are in the cab, in charge of Peridon and Catkin. Those two\r\nwould have writhed like head and tail of a worm, at a division on the\r\nway to the station. Point a finger at Peridon, you run Catkin through\r\nthe body. They’re a fabulous couple.’\r\n\r\nVictor cut him short. ‘I deny that those two are absurd.’\r\n\r\n‘And Catkin’s toothache is a galvanic battery upon Peridon.’\r\n\r\nNataly strongly denied it. Peridon and Catkin pertained to their genial\r\npicture of the dear sweet nest in life; a dale never traversed by the\r\nwithering breath they dreaded.\r\n\r\nFenellan then, to prove that he could be as bad in his way as Colney,\r\nfell to work on the absent Miss Priscilla Graves and Mr. Pempton, with\r\na pitchfork’s exaltation of the sacred attachment of the divergently\r\nmeritorious couple, and a melancholy reference to implacable obstacles\r\nin the principles of each. The pair were offending the amatory corner in\r\nthe generous good sense of Nataly and Victor; they were not to be hotly\r\nprotected, though they were well enough liked for their qualities,\r\nexcept by Lady Grace, who revelled in the horrifying and scandalizing of\r\nMiss Graves. Such a specimen of the Puritan middle English as Priscilla\r\nGraves, was eastwind on her skin, nausea to her gorge. She wondered\r\nat having drifted into the neighbourhood of a person resembling in her\r\nrepellent formal chill virtuousness a windy belfry tower, down among\r\nthose districts of suburban London or appalling provincial towns passed\r\nnow and then with a shudder, where the funereal square bricks-up the\r\nChurch, that Arctic hen-mother sits on the square, and the moving dead\r\nare summoned to their round of penitential exercise by a monosyllabic\r\ntribulation-bell. Fenellan’s graphic sketch of the teetotaller woman\r\nseeing her admirer pursued by Eumenides flagons--abominations of\r\nemptiness--to the banks of the black river of suicides, where the\r\none most wretched light is Inebriation’s nose; and of the vegetarian\r\nvioloncello’s horror at his vision of the long procession of the\r\nflocks and herds into his lady’s melodious Ark of a mouth, excited and\r\ndelighted her antipathy. She was amused to transports at the station, on\r\nhearing Mr. Barmby, in a voice all ophicleide, remark: ‘No, I carry no\r\ninstrument.’ The habitation of it at the bottom of his trunk, was not\r\nforgotten when it sounded.\r\n\r\nReclining in warmth on the deck of the vessel at night, she said, just\r\nunder Victor’s ear: ‘Where are those two?’\r\n\r\n‘Bid me select the couple,’ said he.\r\n\r\nShe rejoined: ‘Silly man’; and sleepily gave him her hand for good\r\nnight, and so paralyzed his arm, that he had to cover the continued\r\njunction by saying more than he intended: ‘If they come to an\r\nunderstanding!’\r\n\r\n‘Plain enough on one side.’\r\n\r\n‘You think it suitable?’\r\n\r\n‘Perfection; and well-planned to let them discover it.’ ‘This is really\r\nmy favourite route; I love the saltwater and the night on deck.’\r\n\r\n‘Go on.’\r\n\r\n‘How?’\r\n\r\n‘Number your loves. It would tax your arithmetic.’\r\n\r\n‘I can hate.’\r\n\r\n‘Not me?’\r\n\r\nPositively the contrary, an impulsive squeeze of fingers declared it;\r\nand they broke the link, neither of them sensibly hurt; though a leaf\r\nor two of the ingenuities, which were her thoughts, turned over in the\r\nphantasies of the lady; and the gentleman was taught to feel that a\r\nnever so slightly lengthened compression of the hand female shoots\r\nwithin us both straight and far and round the corners. There you have\r\nNature, if you want her naked in her elements, for a text. He loved his\r\nNataly truly, even fervently, after the twenty years of union; he looked\r\nabout at no other woman; it happened only that the touch of one, the\r\nchance warm touch, put to motion the blind forces of our mother so\r\nremarkably surcharging him. But it was without kindling. The lady, the\r\nmuch cooler person, did nurse a bit of flame. She had a whimsical liking\r\nfor the man who enjoyed simple things when commanding the luxuries; and\r\nit became a fascination, by extreme contrast, at the reminder of his\r\nadventurous enterprises in progress while he could so childishly enjoy.\r\nWomen who dance with the warrior-winner of battles, and hear him talk\r\nhis ball-room trifles to amuse, have similarly a smell of gunpowder to\r\nintoxicate them.\r\n\r\nFor him, a turn on the deck brought him into new skies. Nataly lay\r\nin the cabin. She used to be where Lady Grace was lying. A sort of\r\npleadable, transparent, harmless hallucination of the renewal of old\r\nservice induced him to refresh and settle the fair semi-slumberer’s\r\npillow, and fix the tarpaulin over her silks and wraps; and bend his\r\nhead to the soft mouth murmuring thanks. The women who can dare the nuit\r\nblanche, and under stars; and have a taste for holiday larks after their\r\nthirtieth, are rare; they are precious. Nataly nevertheless was approved\r\nfor guarding her throat from the nightwind. And a softer southerly\r\nbreath never crossed Channel! The very breeze he had wished for! Luck\r\nwas with him.\r\n\r\nNesta sat by the rails of the vessel beside her Louise. Mr. Sowerby in\r\npassing, exchanged a description of printed agreement with her, upon the\r\nbeauty of the night--a good neutral topic for the encounter of the sexes\r\nnot that he wanted it neutral; it furnished him with a vocabulary. Once\r\nhe perceptibly washed his hands of dutiful politeness, in addressing\r\nMademoiselle de Seilles, likewise upon the beauty of the night; and the\r\nFrench lady, thinking--too conclusively from the breath on the glass\r\nat the moment, as it is the Gallic habit--that if her dear Nesta must\r\nespouse one of the uninteresting creatures called men in her native\r\nland, it might as well be this as another, agreed that the night was\r\nvery beautiful.\r\n\r\n‘He speaks grammatical French,’ Nesta commented on his achievement. ‘He\r\ncontrives in his walking not to wet his boots,’ mademoiselle rejoined.\r\n\r\nMr. Peridon was a more welcome sample of the islanders, despite an\r\ninferior pretension to accent. He burned to be near these ladies, and\r\nhe passed them but once. His enthusiasm for Mademoiselle de Seilles was\r\nnotorious. Gratefully the compliment was acknowledged by her, in her\r\ndemure fashion; with a reserve of comic intellectual contempt for the\r\nman who could not see that women, or Frenchwomen, or eminently she among\r\nthem, must have their enthusiasm set springing in the breast before they\r\ncan be swayed by the most violent of outer gales. And say, that she\r\nis uprooted;--he does but roll a log. Mr. Peridon’s efforts to perfect\r\nhimself in the French tongue touched her.\r\n\r\nA night of May leaning on June, is little more than a deliberate wink of\r\nthe eye of light. Mr. Barmby, an exile from the ladies by reason of an\r\naddiction to tobacco, quitted the forepart of the vessel at the first\r\ngreying. Now was the cloak of night worn threadbare, and grey astir for\r\nthe heralding of gold, day visibly ready to show its warmer throbs.\r\nThe gentle waves were just a stronger grey than the sky, perforce of an\r\ninterfusion that shifted gradations; they were silken, in places oily\r\ngrey; cold to drive the sight across their playful monotonousness for\r\nrefuge on any far fisher-sail.\r\n\r\nMiss Radnor was asleep, eyelids benignly down, lips mildly closed. The\r\ngirl’s cheeks held colour to match a dawn yet unawakened though born.\r\nThey were in a nest shading amid silks of pale blue, and there was\r\na languid flutter beneath her chin to the catch of the morn-breeze.\r\nBacchanal threads astray from a disorderly front-lock of rich brown hair\r\nwere alive over an eyebrow showing like a seal upon the lightest and\r\nsecurest of slumbers.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby gazed, and devoutly. Both the ladies were in their oblivion;\r\nthe younger quite saintly; but the couple inseparably framed, elevating\r\nto behold; a reproach to the reminiscence of pipes. He was near; and\r\nquietly the eyelids of mademoiselle lifted on him. Her look was grave,\r\nstraight, uninquiring, soon accurately perusing; an arrow of Artemis\r\nfor penetration. He went by, with the sound in the throat of a startled\r\nbush-bird taking to wing; he limped off some nail of the deck, as if\r\nthat young Frenchwoman had turned the foot to a hoof. Man could not be\r\nmore guiltless, yet her look had perturbed him; nails conspired; in his\r\nvexation, he execrated tobacco. And ask not why, where reason never was.\r\n\r\nNesta woke babbling on the subject she had relinquished for sleep.\r\nMademoiselle touched a feathery finger at her hair and hood during their\r\nsilvery French chimes.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerby presented the risen morning to them, with encomiums, after\r\nthey had been observing every variation in it. He spoke happily of\r\nthe pleasant passage, and of the agreeable night; particularly of\r\nthe excellent idea of the expedition by this long route at night;\r\nthe prospect of which had disfigured him with his grimace of\r\nspeculation--apparently a sourness that did not exist. Nesta had a\r\nsingular notion, coming of a girl’s mingled observation and intuition,\r\nthat the impressions upon this gentleman were in arrear, did not strike\r\nhim till late. Mademoiselle confirmed it when it was mentioned; she\r\nremembered to have noticed the same in many small things. And it was a\r\npointed perception.\r\n\r\nVictor sent his girl down to Nataly, with a summons to hurry up and see\r\nsunlight over the waters. Nataly came; she looked, and the outer wakened\r\nthe inner, she let the light look in on her, her old feelings danced to\r\nher eyes like a string of bubbles in ascent. ‘Victor, Victor, it seems\r\nonly yesterday that we crossed, twelve years back--was it?--and in May,\r\nand saw the shoal of porpoises, and five minutes after, Dieppe in view.\r\nDear French people! I share your love for France.’\r\n\r\n‘Home of our holidays!--the “drives”; and they may be the happiest.\r\nAnd fifty minutes later we were off the harbour; and Natata landed, a\r\nstranger; and at night she was the heroine of the town.’\r\n\r\nVictor turned to a stately gentleman and passed his name to Nataly: ‘Sir\r\nRodwell Balchington, a neighbour of Lakelands! She understood that Lady\r\nGrace Halley was acquainted with Sir Rodwell:--hence this dash of\r\nbrine to her lips while she was drinking of happy memories, and Victor\r\nevidently was pluming himself upon his usual luck in the fortuitous\r\nencounter with an influential neighbour of Lakelands. He told Sir\r\nRodwell the story of how they had met in the salle a manger of the\r\nhotel the impresario of a Concert in the town, who had in his hand\r\nthe doctor’s certificate of the incapacity of the chief cantatrice to\r\nappear, and waved it, within a step of suicide. ‘Well, to be brief, my\r\nwife--“noble dame Anglaise,” as the man announced her on the Concert\r\nplatform, undertook one of the songs, and sang another of her own-pure\r\ncontralto voice, as you will say; with the result that there was\r\na perfect tumult of enthusiasm. Next day, the waiters of the hotel\r\npresented her with a bouquet of Spring flowers, white, and central\r\nviolets. It was in the Paris papers, under the heading: Une amie d’outre\r\nManche--I think that was it?’ he asked Nataly.\r\n\r\n‘I forget,’ said she.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her: a cloud had risen. He rallied her, spoke of the old\r\nNorman silver cross which the manager of the Concert had sent, humbly\r\nimploring her to accept the small memento of his gratitude. She nodded\r\nan excellent artificial brightness.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the coast of France under young sunlight over the waters.\r\nOnce more her oft-petitioning wish through the years, that she had\r\nentered the ranks of professional singers, upon whom the moral scrutiny\r\nis not so microscopic, invaded her, resembling a tide-swell into\r\nrock-caves, which have been filled before and left to emptiness, and\r\nwill be left to emptiness again. Nataly had the intimation visiting\r\nus when, in a decline of physical power, the mind’s ready vivacity to\r\nconjure illusions forsakes us; and it was, of a wall ahead, and a force\r\nimpelling her against it, and no hope of deviation. And this is the\r\nfeatureless thing, Destiny; not without eyes, if we have a conscience to\r\nthrow them into it to look at us.\r\n\r\nCounsel to her to live in the hour, came, as upon others on the vessel,\r\nfrom an active breath of the salt prompting to healthy hunger; and\r\nhardly less from the splendour of the low full sunlight on the waters,\r\nthe skimming and dancing of the thousands of golden shells away from\r\nunder the globe of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. A PATRIOT ABROAD\r\n\r\nNine days after his master’s departure, Daniel Skepsey, a man of some\r\nrenown of late, as a subject of reports and comments in the newspapers,\r\nobtained a passport, for the identification, if need were, of his\r\nmissing or misapprehended person in a foreign country, of the language\r\nof which three unpronounceable words were knocking about his head to\r\nrender the thought of the passport a staff of safety; and on the morning\r\nthat followed he was at speed through Normandy, to meet his master\r\nrounding homeward from Paris, at a town not to be spoken as it is\r\nwritten, by reason of the custom of the good people of the country, with\r\nwhom we would fain live on neighbourly terms:--yes, and they had proof\r\nof it, not so very many years back, when they were enduring the worst\r\nwhich can befall us--though Mr. Durance, to whom he was indebted for the\r\nwriting of the place of his destination large on a card, and the wording\r\nof the French sound beside it, besides the jotting down of trains and\r\nthe station for the change of railways, Mr. Durance could say, that the\r\nactive form of our sympathy consisted in the pouring of cheeses upon\r\nthem when they were prostrate and unable to resist!\r\n\r\nA kind gentleman, Mr. Durance, as Daniel Skepsey had recent cause to\r\nknow, but often exceedingly dark; not so patriotic as desireable, it\r\nwas to be feared; and yet, strangely indeed, Mr. Durance had said cogent\r\nthings on the art of boxing and on manly exercises, and he hoped--he\r\nwas emphatic in saying he hoped--we should be regenerated. He must have\r\nmeant, that boxing--on a grand scale would contribute to it. He said,\r\nthat a blow now and then was wholesome for us all. He recommended a\r\nmonthly private whipping for old gentlemen who decline the use of the\r\ngloves, to disperse their humours; not excluding Judges and Magistrates:\r\nhe could hardly be in earnest. He spoke in a clergyman’s voice, and said\r\nit would be payment of good assurance money, beneficial to their souls:\r\nhe seemed to mean it. He said, that old gentlemen were bottled vapours,\r\nand it was good for them to uncork them periodically. He said, they\r\nshould be excused half the strokes if they danced nightly--they resented\r\nmotion. He seemed sadly wanting in veneration.\r\n\r\nBut he might not positively intend what he said. Skepsey could overlook\r\neverything he said, except the girding at England. For where is a braver\r\npeople, notwithstanding appearances! Skepsey knew of dozens of gallant\r\nbruisers, ready for the cry to strip to the belt; worthy, with a little\r\npublic encouragement, to rank beside their grandfathers of the Ring,\r\nin the brilliant times when royalty and nobility countenanced the manly\r\nart, our nursery of heroes, and there was not the existing unhappy\r\ndivision of classes. He still trusted to convince Mr. Durance, by means\r\nof argument and happy instances, historical and immediate, that the\r\nEnglish may justly consider themselves the elect of nations, for\r\nreasons better than their accumulation of the piles of gold-better than\r\n‘usurers’ reasons,’ as Mr. Durance called them. Much that Mr. Durance\r\nhad said at intervals was, although remembered almost to the letter of\r\nthe phrase, beyond his comprehension, and he put it aside, with penitent\r\nblinking at his deficiency.\r\n\r\nAll the while, he was hearing a rattle of voluble tongues around him,\r\nand a shout of stations, intelligible as a wash of pebbles, and blocks\r\nin a torrent. Generally the men slouched when they were not running. At\r\nDieppe he had noticed muscular fellows; he admitted them to be nimbler\r\non the legs than ours; and that may count both ways, he consoled a\r\npatriotic vanity by thinking; instantly rebuking the thought; for he\r\nhad read chapters of Military History. He sat eyeing the front row of\r\nfigures in his third-class carriage, musing on the kind of soldiers we\r\nmight, heaven designing it, have to face, and how to beat them; until\r\nhe gazed on Rouen, knowing by the size of it and by what Mr. Durance had\r\ninformed him of the city on the river, that it must be the very city\r\nof Rouen, not so many years back a violated place, at the mercy of a\r\nforeign foe. Strong pity laid hold of Skepsey. He fortified the heights\r\nfor defence, but saw at a glance that it was the city for modern\r\nartillery to command, crush and enter. He lost idea of these afflicted\r\npeople as foes, merely complaining of their attacks on England, and\r\ntheir menaces in their Journals and pamphlets; and he renounced certain\r\nviews of the country to be marched over on the road by this route to\r\nParis, for the dictation of terms of peace at the gates of the French\r\ncapital, sparing them the shameful entry; and this after the rout of\r\ntheir attempt at an invasion of the Island!\r\n\r\nA man opposite him was looking amicably on his lively grey eyes. Skepsey\r\nhanded a card from his pocket. The man perused it, and crying: ‘Dreux?’\r\nwaved out of the carriage-window at a westerly distance, naming Rouen\r\nas not the place, not at all, totally other. Thus we are taught, that\r\na foreign General, ignorant of the language, must confine himself to\r\ndefensive operations at home; he would be a child in the hands of the\r\ncommonest man he meets. Brilliant with thanks in signs, Skepsey drew\r\nfrom his friend a course of instruction in French names, for our\r\nnecessities on a line of march. The roads to Great Britain’s metropolis,\r\nand the supplies of forage and provision at every stage of a march on\r\nLondon, are marked in the military offices of these people; and that,\r\nwith their barking Journals, is a piece of knowledge to justify a\r\nbelligerent return for it. Only we pray to be let live peacefully.\r\n\r\nFervently we pray it when this good man, a total stranger to us,\r\nconducts an ignorant foreigner from one station to another through the\r\nstreets of Rouen, after a short stoppage at the buffet and assistance in\r\nthe identification of coins; then, lifting his cap to us, retires.\r\n\r\nAnd why be dealing wounds and death? It is a more blessed thing to keep\r\nthe Commandments. But how is it possible to keep the Commandments if you\r\nhave a vexatious wife?\r\n\r\nMartha Skepsey had given him a son to show the hereditary energy in his\r\ncrying and coughing; and it was owing, he could plead, to her habits\r\nand her tongue, that he sometimes, that he might avoid the doing of\r\nworse--for she wanted correction and was improved by it--courted the\r\nexcitement of a short exhibition of skill, man to man, on publicans’\r\nfirst floors. He could have told the magistrates so, in part apology for\r\nthe circumstances dragging him the other day, so recently, before his\r\nWorship; and he might have told it, if he had not remembered Captain\r\nDartrey Fenellan’s words about treating women chivalrously which was\r\ninterpreted by Skepsey as correcting them, when called upon to do\r\nit, but never exposing them only, if allowed to account for the\r\ncircumstances pushing us into the newspapers, we should not present so\r\nguilty a look before the public.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as to how far it is the duty of a man to serve his master,\r\nthere is likewise question: whether is he, while receiving reproof\r\nand punishment for excess of zeal in the service of his master, not to\r\nmention the welfare of the country, morally--without establishing it as\r\na principle--exonerated? Miss Graves might be asked save that one would\r\nnot voluntarily trouble a lady on such subjects. But supposing, says the\r\nopposing counsel, now at work in Skepsey’s conscience, supposing this\r\nact, for which, contraveneing the law of the land, you are reproved and\r\npunished, to be agreeable to you, how then? We answer, supposing it--and\r\nwe take uncomplainingly the magistrate’s reproof and punishment--morally\r\njustified can it be expected of us to have the sense of guilt, although\r\nwe wear and know we wear a guilty look before the public?\r\n\r\nHis master and the dear ladies would hear of it; perhaps they knew of it\r\nnow; with them would rest the settlement of the distressing inquiry. The\r\nladies would be shocked ladies cannot bear any semblance of roughness,\r\nnot even with the gloves:--and knowing, as they must, that our practise\r\nof the manly art is for their protection.\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s grievous prospect of the hour to come under judgement of a sex\r\nthat was ever a riddle unread, clouded him on the approach to Dreux. He\r\nstudied the country and the people eagerly; he forbore to conduct great\r\nmilitary operations. Mr. Durance had spoken of big battles round about\r\nthe town of Dreux; also of a wonderful Mausoleum there, not equally\r\ninteresting. The little man was in deeper gloom than a day sobering on\r\ncrimson dusk when the train stopped and his quick ear caught the sound\r\nof the station, as pronounced by his friend at Rouen.\r\n\r\nHe handed his card to the station-master. A glance, and the latter\r\nsignalled to a porter, saying: ‘Paradis’; and the porter laid hold of\r\nSkepsey’s bag. Skepsey’s grasp was firm; he pulled, the porter pulled.\r\nSkepsey heard explanatory speech accompanying a wrench. He wrenched back\r\nwith vigour, and in his own tongue exclaimed, that he held to the bag\r\nbecause his master’s letters were in the bag, all the way from England.\r\nFor a minute, there was a downright trial of muscle and will: the porter\r\nappeared furiously excited, Skepsey had a look of cooled steel. Then the\r\nFrenchman, requiring to shrug, gave way to the Englishman’s eccentric\r\nobstinacy, and signified that he was his guide. Quite so, and Skepsey\r\nshowed alacrity and confidence in following; he carried his bag. But\r\nwith the remembrance of the kindly serviceable man at Rouen, he sought\r\nto convey to the porter, that the terms of their association were\r\ncordial. A waving of the right hand to the heavens ratified the\r\ntreaty on the French side. Nods and smiles and gesticulations, with\r\nacross-Channel vocables, as it were Dover cliffs to Calais sands and\r\nback, pleasantly beguiled the way down to the Hotel du Paradis, under\r\nthe Mausoleum heights, where Skepsey fumbled at his pocket for coin\r\ncurrent; but the Frenchman, all shaken by a tornado of negation, clapped\r\nhim on the shoulder, and sang him a quatrain. Skepsey had in politeness\r\nto stand listening, and blinking, plunged in the contrition of\r\nignorance, eclipsed. He took it to signify something to the effect,\r\nthat money should not pass between friends. It was the amatory farewell\r\naddress of Henri IV. to his Charmante Gabrielle; and with\r\n\r\n            ‘Perce de mille lords,\r\n             L’honneur m’appelle\r\n             Au champ de Mars,’\r\n\r\nthe Frenchman, in a backing of measured steps, apologized for his\r\nenforced withdrawal from the stranger who had captured his heart.\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s card was taken in the passage of the hotel. A clean-capped\r\nmaid, brave on the legs, like all he had seen of these people, preceded\r\nhim at quick march to an upper chamber. When he descended, bag in hand,\r\nshe flung open the salon-door of a table d’hote, where a goodly number\r\nwere dining and chattering; waiters drew him along to the section\r\noccupied by his master’s party. A chair had been kept vacant for him;\r\nhis master waved a hand, his dear ladies graciously smiled; he struck\r\nthe bag in front of a guardian foot, growing happy. He could fancy they\r\nhad not seen the English newspapers. And his next observation of the\r\ntable showed him wrecked and lost: Miss Nesta’s face was the oval of\r\na woeful O at his wild behaviour in England during their absence. She\r\nsmiled. Skepsey had nevertheless to consume his food--excellent,\r\nvery tasty soup-with the sour sauce of the thought that he must be\r\ntongue-tied in his defence for the time of the dinner.\r\n\r\n‘No, dear Skips, please! you are to enjoy yourself,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe answered confusedly, trying to assure her that he was doing so, and\r\nhe choked.\r\n\r\nHis master had fixed his arrival for twenty minutes earlier. Skepsey\r\nspoke through a cough of long delays at stations. The Rev. Septimus\r\nBarmby, officially peacemaker, sounded the consequent excuse for a\r\nbelated comer. It was final; such is the power of sound. Looks were\r\ncast from the French section of the table at the owner of the prodigious\r\norgan. Some of the younger men, intent on the charms of Albion’s\r\ndaughters, expressed in a sign and a word or two alarm at what might be\r\nbeneath the flooring: and ‘Pas encore Lui!’ and ‘Son avant-courrier!’\r\nand other flies of speech passed on a whiff, under politest of cover,\r\nnot to give offence. But prodigies, claim attention.\r\n\r\nOur English, at the close of the dinner, consented to say it was good,\r\nwithout specifying a dish, because a selection of this or that would\r\nhave seemed to italicize, and commit, them, in the presence of ladies,\r\nto a notice of the matter of-course, beneath us, or the confession of\r\na low sensual enjoyment; until Lady Grace Halley named the particular\r\ndressing of a tete de veau approvingly to Victor; and he stating, that\r\nhe had offered a suggestion for the menu of the day, Nataly exclaimed,\r\nthat she had suspected it: upon which Mr. Sowerby praised the menu,\r\nMr. Barmby, Peridon and Catkin named other dishes, there was the right\r\nafter-dinner ring in Victor’s ears, thanks to the woman of the world\r\nwho had travelled round to nature and led the shackled men to deliver\r\nthemselves heartily. One tap, and they are free. That is, in the moments\r\nafter dinner, when nature is at the gates with them. Only, it must be a\r\nlady and a prevailing lady to give the tap. They need (our English) and\r\nwill for the ages of the process of their transformation need a queen.\r\n\r\nSkepsey, bag in hand, obeyed the motion of his master’s head and\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\nHe was presently back, to remain with the ladies during his master’s\r\nperusal of letters. Nataly had decreed that he was not to be troubled;\r\nso Nesta and mademoiselle besought him for a recital of his French\r\nadventures; and strange to say, he had nothing to tell. The journey,\r\npregnant at the start, exciting in the course of it, was absolutely\r\nblank at the termination. French people had been very kind; he could not\r\nsay more. But there was more; there was a remarkable fulness, if only\r\nhe could subordinate it to narrative. The little man did not know, that\r\ntime was wanted for imagination to make the roadway or riverway of a\r\ntrue story, unless we press to invent; his mind had been too busy on\r\nthe way for him to clothe in speech his impressions of the passage\r\nof incidents at the call for them. Things had happened, numbers of\r\ninteresting minor things, but they all slipped as water through the\r\nfingers; and he being of the band of honest creatures who will\r\nnot accept a lift from fiction, drearily he sat before the ladies,\r\nconfessing to an emptiness he was far from feeling.\r\n\r\nNesta professed excessive disappointment. ‘Now, if it had been in\r\nEngland, Skips!’ she said, under her mother’s gentle gloom of brows.\r\n\r\nHe made show of melancholy submission.\r\n\r\n‘There, Skepsey, you have a good excuse, we are sure,’ Nataly said.\r\n\r\nAnd women, when they are such ladies as these, are sent to prove to us\r\nthat they can be a blessing; instead of the dreadful cry to Providence\r\nfor the reason of the spread of the race of man by their means! He\r\ndeclared his readiness, rejecting excuses, to state his case to them,\r\nbut for his fear of having it interpreted as an appeal for their\r\nkind aid in obtaining his master’s forgiveness. Mr. Durance had very\r\nconsiderately promised to intercede. Skepsey dropped a hint or two of\r\nhis naughty proceedings drily aware that their untutored antipathy to\r\nthe manly art would not permit of warmth.\r\n\r\nNesta said: ‘Do you know, Skips, we saw a grand exhibition of fencing in\r\nParis.’\r\n\r\nHe sighed. ‘Ladies can look on at fencing! foils and masks! Captain\r\nDartrey Fenellan has shown me, and says, the French are our masters at\r\nit.’ He bowed constrainedly to mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n‘You box, M. Skepsey!’ she said.\r\n\r\nHis melancholy increased: ‘Much discouragement from Government, Society!\r\nIf ladies... but I do not venture. They are not against Games. But\r\nthese are not a protection... to them, when needed; to the country.\r\nThe country seems asleep to its position. Mr. Durance has remarked on\r\nit:--though I would not always quote Mr. Durance... indeed, he says,\r\nthat England has invested an Old Maid’s All in the Millennium, and is\r\nruined if it delays to come. “Old Maid,” I do not see. I do not--if\r\nI may presume to speak of myself in the same breath with so clever\r\na gentleman, agree with Mr. Durance in everything. But the\r\nchest-measurement of recruits, the stature of the men enlisted, prove\r\nthat we are losing the nursery of our soldiers.’\r\n\r\n‘We are taking them out of the nursery, Skips, if you ‘re for quoting\r\nCaptain Dartrey,’ said Nesta. ‘We’ll never haul down our flag, though,\r\nwhile we have him!’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! Captain Dartrey!’ Skepsey was refreshed by the invocation of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nA summons to his master’s presence cut short something he was beginning\r\nto say about Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. ACCOUNTS FOR SKEPSEY’S MISCONDUCT, SHOWING HOW IT AFFECTED\r\nNATALY\r\n\r\nHis master opened on the bristling business.\r\n\r\n‘What’s this, of your name in the papers, your appearing before a\r\nmagistrate, and a fine? Tell the tale shortly.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey fell upon his attitude for dialectical defence the modest form\r\nof the two hands at rolling play and the head deferentially sidecast.\r\nBut knowing that he had gratified his personal tastes in the act of\r\nserving his master’s interests, an interfusion of sentiments plunged\r\nhim into self-consciousness; an unwonted state with him, clogging to a\r\nsimple story.\r\n\r\n‘First, sir, I would beg you to pardon the printing of your name beside\r\nmine...’\r\n\r\n‘Tush: on with you.’\r\n\r\n‘Only to say, necessitated by the circumstances of the case. I read,\r\nthat there was laughter in the court at my exculpation of my conduct--as\r\nI have to call it; and there may have been. I may have expressed myself\r\n.... I have a strong feeling for the welfare of the country.’\r\n\r\n‘So, it seems, you said to the magistrate. Do you tell me, that the\r\ncause of your gross breach of the law, was a consideration for the\r\nwelfare of the country? Run on the facts.’\r\n\r\n‘The facts--I must have begun badly, sir.’ Skepsey rattled the dry facts\r\nin his head to right them. From his not having begun well, they had\r\nbecome dry as things underfoot. It was an error to have led off with the\r\nsentiments. ‘Two very, two very respectable persons--respectable--were\r\ndesirous to witness a short display of my, my system, I would say; of my\r\nscience, they call it.’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t be nervous. To the point; you went into a field five miles out\r\nof London, in broad day, and stood in a ring, the usual Tiff-raff about\r\nyou!’\r\n\r\n‘With the gloves: and not for money, Sir: for the trial of skill; not\r\nvery many people. I cannot quite see the breach of the law.’\r\n\r\n‘So you told the magistrate. You were fined for your inability to quite\r\nsee. And you had to give security.’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Durance was kindly responsible for me, sir: an acquaintance of the\r\nmagistrate.’\r\n\r\n‘This boxing of yours is a positive mania, Skepsey. You must try to get\r\nthe better of it--must! And my name too! I’m to be proclaimed, as\r\nhaving in my service an inveterate pugilist--who breaks the law from\r\npatriotism! Male or female, these very respectable persons--the people\r\nyour show was meant for?’\r\n\r\n‘Male, sir. Females!... that is, not the respectable ones.’\r\n\r\n‘Take the opinion of the respectable ones for your standard of behaviour\r\nin future.’\r\n\r\n‘It was a mere trial of skill, sir, to prove to one of the spectators,\r\nthat I could be as good as my word. I wished I may say, to conciliate\r\nhim, partly. He would not--he judged by size--credit me with... he\r\nbacked my adversary Jerry Scroom--a sturdy boxer, without the knowledge\r\nof the first principles.’\r\n\r\n‘You beat him?’\r\n\r\n‘I think I taught the man that I could instruct, sir; he was\r\ncomplimentary before we parted. He thought I could not have lasted.\r\nAfter the second round, the police appeared.’\r\n\r\n‘And you ran!’\r\n\r\n‘No, sir; I had nothing on my conscience.’\r\n\r\n‘Why not have had your pugilistic display in a publican’s room in town,\r\nwhere you could have hammer-nailed and ding-donged to your heart’s\r\ncontent for as long as you liked!’\r\n\r\n‘That would have been preferable, from the point of view of safety from\r\nintrusion, I can admit-speaking humbly. But one of the parties--I had a\r\nwish to gratify him--is a lover of old English times and habits and our\r\ncountry scenes. He wanted it to take place on green grass. We drove over\r\nHampstead in three carts and a gig, as a company of pleasure--as it\r\nwas. A very beautiful morning. There was a rest at a public-house. Mr.\r\nShaplow traces the misfortune to that. Mr. Jarniman, I hear, thinks it\r\nwhat he calls a traitor in the camp. I saw no sign; we were all merry\r\nand friendly.’\r\n\r\n‘Jarniman?’ said Victor sharply. ‘Who is the Jarniman?’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Jarniman is, I am to understand from the acquaintance introducing\r\nus--a Mr. Shaplow I met in the train from Lakelands one day, and again\r\nat the corner of a street near Drury Lane, a ham and beef shop kept by\r\na Mrs. Jarniman, a very stout lady, who does the chief carving in the\r\nshop, and is the mother of Mr. Jarniman: he is in a confidential place,\r\nhighly trusted.’ Skepsey looked up from the hands he soaped: ‘He is\r\na curious mixture; he has true enthusiasm for boxing, he believes in\r\nghosts. He mourns for the lost days of prize-fighting, he thinks that\r\nspectres are on the increase. He has a very large appetite, depressed\r\nspirits. Mr. Shaplow informs me he is a man of substance, in the service\r\nof a wealthy lady in poor health, expecting a legacy and her appearance\r\nto him. He has the look--Mr. Shaplow assures me he does not drink to\r\nexcess: he is a slow drinker.’\r\n\r\nVictor straightened: ‘Bad way of health, you said?’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Jarniman spoke of his expectations, as being immediate: he put it,\r\nthat he expected her spirit to be out for him to meet it any day--or\r\nnight. He desires it. He says, she has promised it--on oath, he says,\r\nand must feel that she must do her duty to him before she goes, if she\r\nis to appear to him with any countenance after. But he is anxious for\r\nher in any case to show herself, and says, he should not have the heart\r\nto reproach her. He has principles, a tear for suffering; he likes to be\r\nmade to cry. Mrs. Jarniman, his mother, he is not married, is much the\r\nsame so far, except ghosts; she will not have them; except after strong\r\ntea, they come, she says, come to her bed. She is foolish enough to\r\nsleep in a close-curtained bed. But the poor lady is so exceedingly\r\nstout that a puff of cold would carry her off, she fears.’\r\n\r\nVictor stamped his foot. ‘This man Jarniman serves a lady now in\r\na--serious, does he say? Was he precise?’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Jarniman spoke of a remarkable number of diseases; very\r\ncomplicated, he says. He has no opinion of doctors. He says, that the\r\nlady’s doctor and the chemist--she sits in a chemist’s shop and\r\nswallows other people’s prescriptions that take her fancy. He says, her\r\ncontinuing to live is wonderful. He has no reason to hurry her, only for\r\nthe satisfaction of a natural curiosity.’\r\n\r\n‘He mentioned her name?’\r\n\r\n‘No name, sir.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s limpid grey eyes confirmed the negative to Victor, who was\r\nassured that the little man stood clean of any falsity.\r\n\r\n‘You are not on equal terms. You and the magistrate have helped him to\r\nknow who it is you serve, Skepsey.’\r\n\r\n‘Would you please to direct me, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Another time. Now go and ease your feet with a run over the town.\r\nWe have music in half an hour. That you like, I know. See chiefly to\r\namusing yourself.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey turned to go; he murmured, that he had enjoyed his trip.\r\n\r\nVictor checked him: it was to ask whether this Jarniman had specified\r\none, any one of the numerous diseases afflicting his aged mistress.\r\n\r\nNow Jarniman had shocked Skepsey with his blunt titles for a couple of\r\nthe foremost maladies assailing the poor lady’s decayed constitution:\r\nnot to be mentioned, Skepsey’s thought, in relation to ladies; whose\r\norgans and functions we, who pay them a proper homage by restricting\r\nthem to the sphere so worthily occupied by their mothers up to the very\r\noldest date, respectfully curtain; their accepted masters are chivalrous\r\nto them, deploring their need at times for the doctors and drugs. He\r\nstood looking most unhappy. ‘She was to appear, sir, in a few--perhaps a\r\nweek, a month.’\r\n\r\nA nod dismissed him.\r\n\r\nThe fun of the expedition (and Dudley Sowerby had wound himself up to\r\nrelish it) was at night in the towns, when the sound of instrumental and\r\nvocal music attracted crowds beneath the windows of the hotel, and\r\nthey heard zon, zon, violon, fete et basse; not bad fluting, excellent\r\nfiddling, such singing as a maestro, conducting his own Opera, would\r\nhave approved. So Victor said of his darlings’ voices. Nesta’s and\r\nher mother’s were a perfect combination; Mr. Barmby’s trompe in union,\r\nsufficiently confirmed the popular impression, that they were artistes.\r\nThey had been ceremoniously ushered to their carriages, with expressions\r\nof gratitude, at the departure from Rouen; and the Boniface at Gisors\r\nhad entreated them to stay another night, to give an entertainment.\r\nVictor took his pleasure in letting it be known, that they were a quiet\r\nEnglish family, simply keeping-up the habits they practiced in Old\r\nEngland: all were welcome to hear them while they were doing it; but\r\nthey did not give entertainments.\r\n\r\nThe pride of the pleasure of reversing the general idea of English\r\ndulness among our neighbours, was perceived to have laid fast hold\r\nof Dudley Sowerby at Dreux. He was at the window from time to time,\r\ncounting heads below. For this reason or a better, he begged Nesta to\r\nsupplant the flute duet with the soprano and contralto of the Helena\r\nsection of the Mefistofele, called the Serenade: La Luna immobile. She\r\nconsulted her mother, and they sang it. The crowds below, swollen to\r\na block of the street, were dead still, showing the instinctive\r\ngood manners of the people. Then mademoiselle astonished them with a\r\nProvencal or Cevennes air, Huguenot, though she was Catholic; but\r\nit suited her mezzo-soprano tones; and it rang massively of the\r\nmartial-religious. To what heights of spiritual grandeur might not\r\na Huguenot France have marched! Dudley Sowerby, heedlessly, under an\r\nemotion that could be stirred in him with force, by the soul of religion\r\nissuing through music, addressed his ejaculation to Lady Grace Halley.\r\nShe did nor shrug or snub him, but rejoined: ‘I could go to battle with\r\nthat song in the ears.’ She liked seeing him so happily transformed; and\r\nliked the effect of it on Nesta when his face shone in talking. He was\r\nat home with the girl’s eyes, as he had never been. A song expressing in\r\none of the combative and devotional, went to the springs of his blood;\r\nfor he was of an old warrior race, beneath the thick crust of imposed\r\npeaceful maxims and commercial pursuits and habitual stiff correctness.\r\nAs much as wine, will music bring out the native bent of the civilized\r\nman: endow him with language too. He was as if unlocked; he met\r\nNesta’s eyes and ran in a voluble interchange, that gave him flattering\r\nafter-thoughts; and at the moment sensibly a new and assured, or to some\r\nextent assured, station beside a girl so vivid; by which the young lady\r\nwould be helped to perceive his unvoiced solider gifts.\r\n\r\nNataly observed them, thinking of Victor’s mastering subtlety. She had\r\nhoped (having clearly seen the sheep’s eye in the shepherd) that Mr.\r\nBarmby would be watchful to act as a block between them; and therefore\r\nshe had stipulated for his presence on the journey. She remembered\r\nVictor’s rapid look of readiness to consent:--he reckoned how naturally\r\nMr. Barmby would serve as a foil to any younger man. Mr. Barmby had\r\ntried all along to perform his part: he had always been thwarted;\r\nnotably once at Gisors, where by some cunning management he and\r\nmademoiselle found themselves in the cell of the prisoner’s Nail-wrought\r\nwork while Nesta had to take Sowerby’s hand for help at a passage here\r\nand there along the narrow outer castle-walls. And Mr. Barmby, upon\r\noccasions, had set that dimple in Nesta’s cheek quivering, though Simeon\r\nFenellan was not at hand, and there was no telling how it was done,\r\nbeyond the evidence that Victor willed it so.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of the announcement of Lakelands, she had been brought\r\nmore into contact with his genius of dexterity and foresight than ever\r\npreviously: she had bent to the burden of it more; had seen herself and\r\neverybody else outstripped--herself, of course; she did not count in a\r\nstruggle with him. But since that red dawn of Lakelands, it was\r\nalmost as if he had descended to earth from the skies. She now saw his\r\nmortality in the miraculous things he did. The reason of it was,\r\nthat through the perceptible various arts and shifts on her level, an\r\nopposing spirit had plainer view of his aim, to judge it. She thought it\r\na mean one.\r\n\r\nThe power it had to hurry her with the strength of a torrent to an end\r\nshe dreaded, impressed her physically; so far subduing her mind, in\r\nconsequence, as to keep the idea of absolute resistance obscure, though\r\nher bosom heaved with the breath; but what was her own of a mind hung\r\nhovering above him, criticizing; and involuntarily, discomfortingly.\r\nShe could have prayed to be led blindly or blindly dashed on: she\r\ncould trust him for success; and her critical mind seemed at times a\r\ntreachery. Still she was compelled to judge.\r\n\r\nWhen he said to her at night, pressing both her hands: ‘This is the\r\nnews of the day, my love! It’s death at last. We shall soon be thanking\r\nheaven for freedom’; her fingers writhed upon his and gripped them in a\r\ntorture of remorse on his behalf. A shattering throb of her heart gave\r\nher sight of herself as well. For so it is with the woman who loves in\r\nsubjection, she may be a critic of the man, she is his accomplice.’\r\n\r\n‘You have a letter, Victor?’\r\n\r\n‘Confirmation all round: Fenellan, Themison, and now Skepsey.’\r\n\r\nHe told her the tale of Skepsey and Jarniman, colouring it, as any\r\ninterested animated conduit necessarily will. Neither of them smiled.\r\n\r\nThe effort to think soberly exhausted and rolled her back on credulity.\r\n\r\nIt might not be to-day or next week or month: but so much testimony\r\npointed to a day within the horizon, surely!\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head to heaven for forgiveness. The murderous hope stood\r\nup, stood out in forms and pictures. There was one of a woman at her\r\nease at last in the reception of guests; contrasting with an ironic\r\nhaunting figure of the woman of queenly air and stature under a finger\r\nof scorn for a bold-faced impostor. Nataly’s lips twitched at the\r\nremembrance of quaint whimpers of complaint to the Fates, for directing\r\nthat a large instead of a rather diminutive woman should be the\r\nsocial offender fearing exposure. Majesty in the criminal’s dock, is a\r\nconfounding spectacle. To the bosom of the majestic creature, all her\r\nglorious attributes have become the executioner’s implements. She must\r\nfor her soul’s health believe that a day of release and exoneration\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\n‘Barmby!--if my dear girl would like him best,’ Victor said, in\r\ntenderest undertones, observing the shadowing variations of her face;\r\nand pierced her cruelly, past explanation or understanding;--not that\r\nshe would have objected to the Rev. Septimus as officiating clergyman.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Down rolled the first big tear.\r\n\r\nWe cry to women; Land, ho!--a land of palms after storms at sea; and at\r\nonce they inundate us with a deluge of eye-water.\r\n\r\n‘Half a minute, dear Victor, not longer,’ Nataly said, weeping, near on\r\nlaughing over his look of wanton abandonment to despair at sight of\r\nher tears. ‘Don’t mind me. I am rather like Fenellan’s laundress, the\r\ntearful woman whose professional apparatus was her soft heart and a cake\r\nof soap. Skepsey has made his peace with you?’\r\n\r\nVictor answered: ‘Yes, yes; I see what he has been about. We’re a mixed\r\nlot, all of us-the best! You’ve noticed, Skepsey has no laugh: however\r\nabsurd the thing he tells you, not a smile!’\r\n\r\n‘But you trust his eyes; you look fathoms into them. Captain Dartrey\r\nthinks him one of the men most in earnest of any of his country.’\r\n\r\n‘So Nataly of course thinks the same. And he’s a worthy little\r\nvelocipede, as Fenellan calls him. One wishes Colney had been with us.\r\nOnly Colney!--pity one can’t cut his talons for the space before they\r\ngrow again.’\r\n\r\nAy, and in the presence of Colney Durance, Victor would not have been\r\nso encouraging, half boyishly caressing, with Dudley Sowerby! It was the\r\nvery manner to sow seed of imitativeness in the girl, devoted as she was\r\nto her father. Nataly sighed, foreseeing evil, owning it a superstition,\r\nfeeling it a certainty. We are easily prophets, sure of being justified,\r\nwhen the cleverness of schemes devoted to material ends appears most\r\ndelicately perfect. History, the tales of households, the tombstone, are\r\nwith us to inspire. In Nataly’s bosom, the reproof of her inefficiency\r\nfor offering counsel where Victor for his soul’s sake needed it, was\r\nbeginning to thunder at whiles as a reproach of unfittingness in his\r\nmate, worse than a public denunciation of the sin against Society.\r\n\r\nIt might be decreed that she and Society were to come to reconcilement.\r\nA pain previously thought of, never previously so realized, seized her\r\nat her next sight of Nesta. She had not taken in her front mind the\r\ncontrast of the innocent one condemned to endure the shadow from which\r\nthe guilty was by a transient ceremony released. Nature could at a push\r\nbe eloquent to defend the guilty. Not a word of vindicating eloquence\r\nrose up to clear the innocent. Nothing that she could do; no\r\ndevotedness, not any sacrifice, and no treaty of peace, no possible joy\r\nto come, nothing could remove the shadow from her child. She dreamed\r\nof the succour in eloquence, to charm the ears of chosen juries while a\r\nfact spoke over the population, with a relentless rolling out of its one\r\nhard word. But eloquence, powerful on her behalf, was dumb when referred\r\nto Nesta. It seemed a cruel mystery. How was it permitted by the\r\nMerciful Disposer! .... Nataly’s intellect and her reverence clashed.\r\nThey clash to the end of time if we persist in regarding the Spirit of\r\nLife as a remote Externe, who plays the human figures, to bring about\r\nthis or that issue, instead of being beside us, within us, our breath,\r\nif we will; marking on us where at each step we sink to the animal,\r\nmount to the divine, we and ours who follow, offspring of body or mind.\r\nShe was in her error, from judgeing of the destiny of man by the fate\r\nof individuals. Chiefly her error was, to try to be thinking at all amid\r\nthe fevered tangle of her sensations.\r\n\r\nA darkness fell upon the troubled woman, and was thicker overhead when\r\nher warm blood had drawn her to some acceptance of the philosophy of\r\nexistence, in a savour of gratification at the prospect of her equal\r\nfooting with the world while yet she lived. She hated herself for\r\ntaking pleasure in anything to be bestowed by a world so hap-hazard,\r\nill-balanced, unjust; she took it bitterly, with such naturalness as\r\nnot to be aware that it was irony and a poisonous irony moving her to\r\nwelcome the restorative ceremony because her largeness of person had a\r\ngreater than common need of the protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. CHIEFLY UPON THE THEME OF A YOUNG MAID’S IMAGININGS\r\n\r\nThat Mausoleum at Dreux may touch to lift us. History, pleads for the\r\npride of the great discrowned Family giving her illumination there.\r\nThe pride is reverently postured, the princely mourning-cloak it wears\r\nbecomingly braided at the hem with fair designs of our mortal humility\r\nin the presence of the vanquisher; against whom, acknowledgeing a\r\nvisible conquest of the dust, it sustains a placid contention in\r\ncoloured glass and marbles.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Seilles, a fervid Orleanist, was thanked for having\r\nadvised the curvature of the route homeward to visit ‘the spot of so\r\nimpressive a monument’: as it, was phrased by the Rev. Septimus Barmby;\r\nwhose exposition to Nesta of the beautiful stained-glass pictures\r\nof incidents in the life of the crusading St. Louis, was toned to be\r\nlikewise impressive:--Colney Durance not being at hand to bewail the\r\npathos of his exhaustless ‘whacking of the platitudes’; which still\r\nretain their tender parts, but cry unheard when there is no cynic near.\r\nMr. Barmby laid-on solemnly.\r\n\r\nProfessional devoutness is deemed more righteous on such occasions than\r\npoetic fire. It robes us in the cloak of the place, as at a funeral.\r\nGenerally, Mr. Barmby found, and justly, that it is in superior\r\nestimation among his countrymen of all classes. They are shown by\r\nexample how to look, think, speak; what to do. Poets are disturbing;\r\nthey cannot be comfortably imitated, they are unsafe, not certainly the\r\nmetal, unless you have Laureates, entitled to speak by their pay and\r\ndecorations; and these are but one at a time-and a quotation may remind\r\nus of a parody, to convulse the sacred dome! Established plain prose\r\nofficials do better for our English. The audience moved round with heads\r\nof undertakers.\r\n\r\nVictor called to recollection Fenellan’s ‘Rev. Glendoveer’ while Mr.\r\nBarmby pursued his discourse, uninterrupted by tripping wags. And those\r\nwho have schemes, as well as those who are startled by the criticism in\r\nlaughter to discover that they have cause for shunning it, rejoice when\r\nwits are absent. Mr. Sowerby and Nesta interchanged a comment on Mr.\r\nBarmby’s remarks: The Fate of Princes! The Paths of Glory! St. Louis\r\nwas a very distant Roman Catholic monarch; and the young gentleman of\r\nEvangelical education could admire him as a Crusader. St. Louis was\r\nfor Nesta a figure in the rich hues of royal Saintship softened to\r\nhomeliness by tears. She doated on a royalty crowned with the Saint’s\r\nhalo, that swam down to us to lift us through holy human showers. She\r\nlistened to Mr. Barmby, hearing few sentences, lending his eloquence all\r\nshe felt: he rolled forth notes of a minster organ, accordant with the\r\ndevotional service she was holding mutely. Mademoiselle upon St. Louis:\r\n‘Worthy to be named King of Kings!’ swept her to a fount of thoughts,\r\nwhere the thoughts are not yet shaped, are yet in the breast of the\r\nmother emotions. Louise de Seilles had prepared her to be strangely and\r\ndeeply moved. The girl had a heart of many strings, of high pitch, open\r\nto be musical to simplest wandering airs or to the gales. This crypt of\r\nthe recumbent sculptured figures and the coloured series of acts in the\r\npassage of the crowned Saint thrilled her as with sight of flame on an\r\naltar-piece of History. But this King in the lines of the Crucifixion\r\nleading, gave her a lesson of life, not a message from death. With such\r\na King, there would be union of the old order and the new, cessation\r\nto political turmoil: Radicalism, Socialism, all the monster names of\r\nthings with heads agape in these our days to gobble-up the venerable,\r\nobliterate the beautiful, leave a stoniness of floods where field and\r\ngarden were, would be appeased, transfigured. She hoped, she prayed for\r\nthat glorious leader’s advent.\r\n\r\nOn one subject, conceived by her only of late, and not intelligibly, not\r\ncommunicably: a subject thickly veiled; one which struck at her through\r\nher sex and must, she thought, ever be unnamed (the ardent young\r\ncreature saw it as a very thing torn by the winds to show hideous gleams\r\nof a body rageing with fire behind the veil): on this one subject, her\r\nhopes and prayers were dumb in her bosom. It signified shame. She knew\r\nnot the how, for she had no power to contemplate it: there was a torment\r\nof earth and a writhing of lurid dust-clouds about it at a glimpse.\r\nBut if the new crusading Hero were to come attacking that--if some born\r\nprince nobly man would head the world to take away the withering scarlet\r\nfrom the face of women, she felt she could kiss the print of his feet\r\nupon the ground. Meanwhile she had enjoyment of her plunge into the\r\ninmost forest-well of mediaeval imaginativeness, where youthful minds of\r\ngood aspiration through their obscurities find much akin to them.\r\n\r\nShe had an eye for little Skepsey too: unaware that these French Princes\r\nhad hurried him off to Agincourt, for another encounter with them and\r\nthe old result--poor dear gentlemen, with whom we do so wish to be\r\nfriendly! What amused her was, his evident fatigue in undergoing the\r\nslow parade, and sheer deference to his betters, as to the signification\r\nof a holiday on arrested legs. Dudley Sowerby’s attention to him, in\r\nelucidating the scenes with historical scraps, greatly pleased her. The\r\nRev. Septimus of course occupied her chiefly.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle was always near, to receive his repeated expressions of\r\ngratitude for the route she had counselled. Without personal objections\r\nto a well-meaning orderly man, whose pardonable error it was to be\r\naiming too considerably higher than his head, she did but show him the\r\nvoluble muteness of a Frenchwoman’s closed lips; not a smile at all, and\r\ncertainly no sign of hostility; when bowing to his reiterated compliment\r\nin the sentence of French. Mr. Barmby had noticed (and a strong\r\nsentiment rendered him observant, unwontedly) a similar alert immobility\r\nof her lips, indicating foreign notions of this kind or that, in\r\nEngland: an all but imperceptible shortening or loss of corners at the\r\nmouth, upon mention of marriages of his clergy: particularly once, at\r\nhis reading of a lengthy report in a newspaper of a Wedding Ceremony\r\ninvolving his favourite Bishop for bridegroom: a report to make one glow\r\nlike Hymen rollicking the Torch after draining the bumper to the flying\r\nslipper. He remembered the look, and how it seemed to intensify on the\r\nslumbering features, at a statement, that his Bishop was a widower,\r\nentering into nuptials in his fifty-fourth year. Why not? But we ask it\r\nof Heaven and Man, why not? Mademoiselle was pleasant: she was young or\r\nyoungish; her own clergy were celibates, and--no, he could not argue\r\nthe matter with a young or youngish person of her sex. Could it be a\r\nreasonable woman--a woman!--who, disapproved the holy nuptials of the\r\npastors of the flocks? But we are forbidden to imagine the conducting of\r\nan argument thereon with a lady.\r\n\r\nLuther... but we are not in Luther’s time:--Nature... no, nor can there\r\npossibly be allusions to Nature. Mr. Barmby wondered at Protestant\r\nparents taking a Papistical governess for their young flower of English\r\nwomanhood. However, she venerated St. Louis; he cordially also; there\r\nthey met; and he admitted, that she had, for a Frenchwoman, a handsome\r\nface, and besides an agreeably artificial ingenuousness in the looks\r\nwhich could be so politely dubious as to appear only dubiously adverse.\r\n\r\nThe spell upon Nesta was not blown away on English ground; and when her\r\nfather and mother were comparing their impressions, she could not but\r\nkeep guard over the deeper among her own. At the Chateau de Gisors,\r\nleftward off Vernon on Seine, it had been one of romance and wonderment,\r\nwith inquisitive historic soundings of her knowledge and mademoiselle’s,\r\na reverence for the prisoner’s patient holy work, and picturings of his\r\nwatchful waiting daily, Nail in hand, for the heaven-sent sunlight on\r\nthe circular dungeon-wall through the slits of the meurtrieres. But the\r\nMausoleum at Dreux spake religiously; it enfolded Mr. Barmby, his voice\r\nre-edified it. The fact that he had discoursed there, though not a\r\nword of the discourse was remembered, allied him to the spirit of a\r\nday rather increasing in sacredness as it receded and left her less the\r\npossessor of it, more the worshipper.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle had to say to herself: ‘Impossible!’ after seeing the drift\r\nof her dear Nesta’s eyes in the wake of the colossal English clergyman.\r\nShe fed her incredulousness indignantly on the evidence confounding\r\nit. Nataly was aware of unusual intonations, treble-stressed, in the\r\nBethesda and the Galilee of Mr. Barmby on Concert evenings: as it were,\r\nthe towering wood-work of the cathedral organ in quake under emission of\r\nits multitudinous outroar. The ‘Which?’ of the Rev. Septimus, addressed\r\nto Nesta, when song was demanded of him; and her ‘Either’; and his\r\ngentle hesitation, upon a gaze at her for the directing choice, could\r\nnot be unnoticed by women.\r\n\r\nDid he know a certain thing?--and dream of urging the suit, as an\r\nindulgent skipper of parental pages?\r\n\r\nSuch haunting interrogations were the conspirators’ daggers out at any\r\ninstant, or leaping in sheath, against Nataly’s peace of mind. But\r\nshe trusted her girl’s laughing side to rectify any little sentimental\r\noverbalancing. She left the ground where maternal meditations are\r\nserious, at an image of Mr. Barmby knocking at Nesta’s heart as a lover.\r\nWas it worth inquiry?\r\n\r\nA feminine look was trailed across the eyes of mademoiselle, with\r\nmention of Mr. Barmby’s name.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle rippled her shoulders. ‘We are at present much enamoured of\r\nBethesda.’\r\n\r\nThat watchfullest showing no alarm, the absurdity of the suspicion\r\nsmothered it.\r\n\r\nNataly had moreover to receive startling new guests:\r\n\r\nLady Rodwell Blachington: Mrs. Fanning, wife of the General: young Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy, wife of the great bill-broker: ladies of Wrensham and about.\r\nAnd it was a tasking of her energies equal to the buffeting of recurrent\r\nwaves on deep sea. The ladies were eager for her entry into Lakelands.\r\nShe heard that Victor had appointed Lady Blachington’s third son to the\r\ncoveted post of clerk in the Indian house of Inchling and Radnor. These\r\nare the deluge days when even aristocracy will cry blessings on the\r\nman who procures a commercial appointment for one of its younger sons\r\noffended and rebutted by the barrier of Examinations for the Civil\r\nService. ‘To have our Adolphus under Mr. Victor Radnor’s protection, is\r\na step!’ Lady Blachington said. Nataly was in an atmosphere of hints\r\nand revealings. There were City Dinners, to which one or other of the\r\nresidents about Lakelands had been taken before he sat at Victor’s\r\nLondon table. He was already winning his way, apparently without effort,\r\nto be the popular man of that neighbourhood. A subterranean tide or\r\na slipping of earth itself seemed bearing her on. She had his promise\r\nindeed, that he would not ask of her to enter Lakelands until the day of\r\nhis freedom had risen; but though she could trust to his word, the\r\nheart of the word went out of it when she heard herself thanked by Lady\r\nBlachington (who could so well excuse her at such a time of occupation\r\nfor not returning her call, that she called in a friendly way a second\r\ntime, warmly to thank her) for throwing open the Concert room at\r\nLakelands in August, to an Entertainment in assistance of the funds for\r\nthe purpose of erecting an East of London Clubhouse, where the children\r\nof the poor by day could play, and their parents pass a disengaged\r\nevening. Doubtless a worthy Charity. Nataly was alive to the duties of\r\nwealth. Had it been simply a demand for a donation, she would not have\r\nshown that momentary pucker of the brows, which Lady Blachington read as\r\na contrast with the generous vivacity of the husband.\r\n\r\nNataly read a leaf of her fate in this announcement. Nay, she beheld\r\nherself as the outer world wexedly beholds a creature swung along to the\r\ndoing of things against the better mind. An outer world is thoughtless\r\nof situations which prepare us to meet the objectionable with a will\r\nbenumbed;--if we do not, as does that outer world, belong to the party\r\nof the readily heroical. She scourged her weakness: and the intimation\r\nof the truth stood over her, more than ever manifest, that the\r\ndeficiency affecting her character lay in her want of language. A tongue\r\nto speak and contend, would have helped her to carve a clearer way. But\r\nthen again, the tongue to speak must be one which could reproach, and\r\nstrike at errors; fence, and continually summon resources to engage the\r\nelectrical vitality of a man like Victor. It was an exultation of their\r\nlife together, a mark of his holiness for them both, that they had never\r\nbreathed a reproach upon one another.\r\n\r\nShe dropped away from ideas of remonstrance; faintly seeing, in her sigh\r\nof submission, that the deficiency affecting her character would have\r\nbeen supplied by a greater force of character, pressing either to speech\r\nor acts. The confession of a fated inevitable in the mind, is weakness\r\nprostrate. She knew it: but she could point to the manner of man she was\r\nmatched with; and it was not a poor excuse.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby, she thought, deserved her gratitude in some degree\r\nfor stepping between Mr. Sowerby and Nesta. The girl not having\r\ninclinations, and the young gentleman being devoid of stratagem, they\r\nwere easily kept from the dangerous count of two.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle would have said, that the shepherd also had rarely if ever\r\na minute quite alone with her lamb. Incredulously she perceived signs of\r\na shock. The secret following the signs was betrayed by Nesta in return\r\nfor a tender grasp of hands and a droll flutter of eyelids. Out it came,\r\non a nod first; then a dreary mention of a date, and an incident,\r\nto bring it nearer to comprehension. Mr. Barmby--and decide who will\r\nwhether it is that Love was made to elude or that curates impelled by\r\nhis fires are subtle as nether--had outwitted French watchfulness by\r\nstealing minutes enough on a day at Lakelands to declare himself. And\r\nno wonder the girl looked so forlorn: he had shivered her mediaeval\r\nforest-palace of illuminated glass, to leave her standing like a\r\nmountain hind, that sniffs the tainted gale off the crag of her\r\nfirst quick leap from hounds; her instincts alarmed, instead of rich\r\nimagination colouring and fostering.\r\n\r\nShe had no memory for his words; so, and truly, she told her Louise:\r\nmeaning that she had only a spiceless memory; especially for the word\r\nlove in her ears from the mouth of a man.\r\n\r\nThere had been a dream of it; with the life-awakening marvel it would\r\nbe, the humbleness it would bring to her soul beneath the golden\r\nclothing of her body: one of those faint formless dreams, which are as\r\nthe bend of grasses to the breath of a still twilight. She lived\r\ntoo spiritedly to hang on any dream; and had moreover a muffled\r\ndread-shadow-sister to the virginal desire--of this one, as of a fateful\r\npower that might drag her down, disorder, discolour. But now she had\r\nheard it: the word, the very word itself! in her own ears! addressed to\r\nher! in a man’s voice! The first utterance had been heard, and it was\r\nover; the chapter of the book of bulky promise of the splendours and\r\nmysteries;--the shimmering woods and bushy glades, and the descent of\r\nthe shape celestial, and the recognition--the mutual cry of affinity;\r\nand overhead the crimson outrolling of the flag of beneficent\r\nenterprises hand in hand, all was at an end. These, then, are the\r\ndeceptions our elders tell of! That masculine voice should herald a new\r\nworld to the maiden. The voice she had heard did but rock to ruin the\r\nworld she had been living in.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle prudently forbore from satirical remarks on his person or\r\non his conduct. Nesta had nothing to defend: she walked in a bald waste.\r\n\r\n‘Can I have been guilty of leading him to think...?’ she said, in a tone\r\nthat writhed, at a second discussion of this hapless affair.\r\n\r\n‘They choose to think,’ mademoiselle replied. ‘It is he or another. My\r\ndear and dearest, you have entered the field where shots fly thick,\r\nas they do to soldiers in battle; and it is neither your fault nor any\r\none’s, if you are hit.’\r\n\r\nNesta gazed at her, with a shy supplicating cry of ‘Louise.’\r\n\r\nMademoiselle immediately answered the tone of entreaty. ‘Has it happened\r\nto me? I am of the age of eight and twenty; passable, to look at: yes,\r\nmy dear, I have gone through it. To spare you the questions tormenting\r\nyou, I will tell you, that perhaps our experience of our feelings comes\r\nnigh on a kind of resemblance. The first gentleman who did me the honour\r\nto inform me of his passion, was a hunchback.’\r\n\r\nNesta cried ‘Oh!’ in a veritable pang of sympathy, and clapped hands to\r\nher ears, to shut out Mr. Barmby’s boom of the terrific word attacking\r\nLouise from that deformed one.\r\n\r\nHer disillusionment became of the sort which hears derision. A girl of\r\nquick blood and active though unregulated intellect, she caught at the\r\ncomic of young women’s hopes and experiences, in her fear of it.\r\n\r\n‘My own precious poor dear Louise! what injustice there is in the world\r\nfor one like my Louise to have a hunchback to be the first...!’\r\n\r\n‘But, my dear, it did me no harm.’\r\n\r\n‘But if it had been known!’\r\n\r\n‘But it was known!’\r\n\r\nNesta controlled a shuddering: ‘It is the knowledge of it in\r\nourselves--that it has ever happened;--you dear Louise, who deserve so\r\nmuch better! And one asks--Oh, why are we not left in peace! And do look\r\nat the objects it makes of us!’ Mademoiselle: could see, that the girl’s\r\ndesperation had got hold of her humour for a life-buoy. ‘It is really\r\nworse to have it unknown--when you are compelled to be his partner in\r\nsharing the secret, and feel as if it were a dreadful doll you conceal\r\nfor fear that everybody will laugh at its face.’\r\n\r\nShe resumed her seriousness: ‘I find it so hard to be vexed with him and\r\nreally really like him. For he is a good man; but he will not let one\r\nshake him off. He distresses: because we can’t quite meet as we did.\r\nLast Wednesday Concert evening, he kept away; and I am annoyed that I\r\nwas glad.’\r\n\r\n‘Moths have to pass through showers, and keep their pretty patterns from\r\ndamage as best they can,’ said mademoiselle.\r\n\r\nNesta transformed herself into a disciple of Philosophy on the spot.\r\n‘Yes, all these feelings of ours are moth-dust! One feels them. I\r\nsuppose they pass. They must. But tell me, Louise, dear soul, was your\r\npoor dear good little afflicted suitor--was he kindly pitied?’\r\n\r\n‘Conformably with the regulations prescribed to young damsels who are in\r\nrequest to surrender the custody of their hands. It is easy to commit\r\na dangerous excess in the dispensing of that article they call pity of\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\n‘And he--did he?--vowed to you he could not take No for an answer?’\r\n\r\nAt this ingenuous question, woefully uttered, mademoiselle was pricked,\r\nto smile pointedly. Nesta had a tooth on her under-lip. Then, shaking\r\nvapours to the winds, she said: ‘It is an honour, to be asked; and we\r\ncannot be expected to consent. So I shall wear through it.--Only I\r\ndo wish that Mr. Fenellan would not call him The Inchcape Bell!’ She\r\nmurmured this to herself.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby was absent for two weeks. ‘Can anything have offended him?’\r\nVictor inquired, in some consternation, appreciating the man’s worth,\r\nand the grand basso he was; together with the need for him at the\r\nLakelands Concert in August.\r\n\r\nNataly wrote Mr. Barmby a direct invitation. She had no reply. Her\r\nspeculations were cut short by Victor, who handed her a brief note\r\naddressed to him and signed by the Rev. Septimus, petitioning for a\r\nprivate interview.\r\n\r\nThe formality of the request incensed Victor. ‘Now, dear love, you see\r\nColney’s meaning, when he says, there are people who have no intimacy in\r\nthem. Here’s a man who visits me regularly once a week or more, has been\r\nfamiliar for years--four, at least; and he wants to speak to me, and\r\nmust obtain the “privilege” by special appointment! What can be the\r\nmeaning of it?’\r\n\r\n‘You will hear to-morrow afternoon,’ Nataly said, seeing one paved way\r\nto the meaning--a too likely meaning... ‘He hasn’t been... nothing about\r\nFredi, surely!’\r\n\r\n‘I have had no information.’\r\n\r\n‘Impossible! Barmby has good sense; Bottesini can’t intend to come\r\nscraping on that string. But we won’t lose him; he’s one of us. Barmby\r\ncounts for more at a Charity Concert than all the catalogue, and\r\nparticularly in the country. But he’s an excellent fellow--eh?’\r\n\r\n‘That he is,’ Nataly agreed.\r\n\r\nVictor despatched a cheerful curt consent to see Mr. Barmby privately on\r\nthe late afternoon of the day to follow.\r\n\r\nNesta, returning home from the park at that hour of the interview,\r\nignorant of Mr. Barmby’s purpose though she was, had her fires\r\nextinguished by the rolling roar of curfew along the hall-passage, out\r\nof the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. SUITORS FOR THE HAND OF NESTA VICTORIA\r\n\r\nWhen, upon the well-known quest, the delightful singer Orpheus took that\r\ndownward way, coming in sight of old Cerberus centiceps, he astutely\r\nfeigned inattention to the hostile appearances of the multiple beast,\r\nand with a wave of his plectrum over the responsive lyre, he at the\r\nstroke raised voice. This much you know. It may be communicated to you,\r\nthat there was then beheld the most singular spectacle ever exhibited\r\non the dizzy line of division between the living and the dead. For those\r\nunaccustomed musical tones in the last thin whiff of our sustaining air\r\nwere so smartingly persuasive as to pierce to the vitals of the faithful\r\nOld Dog before his offended sentiments had leisure to rouse their heads\r\nagainst a beggar of a mortal. The terrible sugariness which poured into\r\nhim worked like venom to cause an encounter and a wrestling: his battery\r\nof jaws expressed it. They gaped. At the same time, his eyeballs gave\r\nup. All the Dog, that would have barked the breathing intruder an\r\nhundredfold back to earth, was one compulsory centurion yawn. Tears,\r\nissue of the frightful internal wedding of the dulcet and the sour (a\r\nravishing rather of the latter by the former), rolled off his muzzles.\r\n\r\nNow, if you are not for insisting that a magnificent simile shall be\r\ncomposed of exactly the like notes in another octave, you will catch\r\nthe fine flavour of analogy and be wafted in a beat of wings across\r\nthe scene of the application of the Rev. Septimus Barmby to Mr. Victor\r\nRadnor, that he might enter the house in the guise of suitor for\r\nthe hand of Nesta Victoria. It is the excelling merit of similes and\r\nmetaphors to spring us to vault over gaps and thickets and dreary\r\nplaces. But, as with the visits of Immortals, we must be ready to\r\nreceive them. Beware, moreover, of examining them too scrupulously:\r\nthey have a trick of wearing to vapour if closely scanned. Let it be\r\ngratefully for their aid.\r\n\r\nSo far the comparison is absolute, that Mr. Barmby passed: he was at\r\nliberty to pursue his quest.\r\n\r\nVictor could not explain how he had been brought to grant it. He was at\r\npains to conceal the bewilderment Mr. Barmby had cast on him, and make\r\nNataly see the smallness of the grant:--both of them were unwilling to\r\nlose Barmby; there was not the slightest fear about Fredi, he said;\r\nand why should not poor Barmby have his chance with the others in the\r\nrace!--and his Nataly knew that he hated to speak unkindly: he could cry\r\nthe negative like a crack of thunder in the City. But such matters as\r\nthese! and a man pleading merely for the right to see the girl!--and\r\npleading in a tone... ‘I assure you, my love, he touched chords.’\r\n\r\n‘Did he allude to advantages in the alliance with him?’ Nataly asked\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\n‘His passion--nothing else. Candid enough. And he had a tone--he has\r\na tone, you know. It ‘s not what he said. Some allusion to belief in a\r\nfavourable opinion of him... encouragement... on the part of the mama.\r\nShe would have him travelling with us! I foresaw it.’\r\n\r\n‘You were astonished when it came.’\r\n\r\n‘We always are.’\r\n\r\nVictor taunted her softly with having encouraged Mr. Barmby.\r\n\r\nShe had thought in her heart--not seriously; on a sigh of\r\ndespondency--that Mr. Barmby espousing the girl would smooth a troubled\r\nprospect: and a present resentment at her weakness rendered her shrewd\r\nto detect Victor’s cunning to cover his own: a thing imaginable of him\r\npreviously in sentimental matters, yet never accurately and so legibly\r\nprinted on her mind. It did not draw her to read him with a novel\r\nfamiliarity; it drew her to be more sensible of foregone intimations of\r\nthe man he was--irresistible in attack, not impregnably defensive. Nor\r\ndid he seem in this instance humanely considerate: if mademoiselle’s\r\nestimate of the mind of the girl was not wrong, then Mr. Barmby’s\r\nposition would be both a ridiculous and a cruel one. She had some silly\r\nfinal idea that the poor man might now serve permanently to check the\r\nmore dreaded applicant: a proof that her ordinary reflectiveness was\r\nblunted.\r\n\r\nNataly acknowledged, after rallying Victor for coming to have his\r\nweakness condoned, a justice in his counter-accusation, of a loss of her\r\nnatural cheerfulness, and promised amendment, with a steely smile, that\r\nhis lips mimicked fondly; and her smile softened. To strengthen the dear\r\nsoul’s hopes, he spoke, as one who had received the latest information,\r\nof Dr. Themison and surgeons; little conscious of the tragic depths he\r\nstruck or of the burden he gave her heart to bear. Her look alarmed him.\r\nShe seemed to be hugging herself up to the tingling scalp, and was in a\r\nmoment marble to sight and touch. She looked like the old engravings of\r\nmartyrs taking the bite of the jaws of flame at the stake.\r\n\r\nHe held her embraced, feeling her body as if it were in the awful grip\r\nof fingers from the outside of life.\r\n\r\nThe seizure was over before it could be called ominous. When it was once\r\nover, and she had smiled again and rebuked him for excessive anxiety,\r\nhis apprehensions no longer troubled him, but subsided sensationally\r\nin wrath at the crippled woman who would not obey the dictate of her\r\nailments instantly to perish and spare this dear one annoyance.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, later than usual, he performed his usual mental penance\r\nfor it. In consequence, the wrath, and the wish, and the penitence,\r\nhaunted him, each swelling to possession of him in turn; until they\r\nunited to head a plunge into retrospects; which led to his reviewing the\r\narmy of charges against Mrs. Burman.\r\n\r\nAnd of this he grew ashamed, attributing it to the morbid indulgence in\r\nreflection: a disease never afflicting him anterior to the stupid fall\r\non London Bridge. He rubbed instinctively for the punctilio-bump, and\r\ncould cheat his fancy to think a remainder of it there, just below,\r\nhalf an inch to the right of, the spot where a phrenologist, invited by\r\nNataly in old days, had marked philo-progenitiveness on his capacious\r\nand enviable cerebrum. He knew well it was a fancy. But it was a fact\r\nalso, that since the day of the fall (never, save in merest glimpses,\r\nbefore that day), he had taken to look behind him, as though an eye had\r\nbeen knocked in the back of his head.\r\n\r\nThen, was that day of the announcement of Lakelands to Nataly, to be\r\naccounted a gloomy day? He would not have it so.\r\n\r\nShe was happily occupied with her purchases of furniture, Fredi with\r\nher singing lessons, and he with his business; a grasp of many ribands,\r\nreining-in or letting loose; always enjoyable in the act. Recently only\r\nhad he known when at home, a relaxation, a positive pleasure in looking\r\nforward to the hours of the City office. This was odd, but so it was;\r\nand looking homeward from the City, he had a sense of disappointment\r\nwhen it was not Concert evening. The Cormyns, the Yatts, and Priscilla\r\nGraves, and Pempton, foolish fellow, and that bothering Barmby, and\r\nPeridon and Catkin, were the lineing of his nest. Well, and so they\r\nhad been before Lakelands rose. What had induced!... he suddenly felt\r\nforeign to himself. The shrouded figure of his lost Idea on London\r\nBridge went by.\r\n\r\nA peep into the folds of the shroud was granted him:--Is it a truth,\r\nthat if we are great owners of money, we are so swollen with a force not\r\nnative to us, as to be precipitated into acts the downright contrary of\r\nour tastes?\r\n\r\nHe inquired it of his tastes, which have the bad habit of unmeasured\r\nphrasing when they are displeased, and so they yield no rational\r\nanswer. Still he gave heed to violent extraneous harpings against money.\r\nEpigrams of Colney’s; abuse of it and the owners of it by Socialist\r\norators reported in some newspaper corner; had him by the ears.\r\n\r\nThey ceased in the presence of Lady Grace Halley, who entered his\r\noffice to tell him she was leaving town for Whinfold, her husband’s\r\nfamily-seat, where the dear man lay in evil case. She signified her\r\nresignation to the decrees from above, saying generously:\r\n\r\n‘You look troubled, my friend. Any bad City news?’\r\n\r\n‘I look troubled?’ Victor said laughing, and bethought him of what the\r\ntrouble might be. ‘City news would not cause the look. Ah, yes;--I was\r\ntalking in the street to a friend of mine on horseback the other day,\r\nand he kept noticing his horse’s queer starts. We spied half a dozen\r\nchildren in the gutter, at the tail of the horse, one of them plucking\r\nat a hair. “Please, sir, may I have a hair out of your horse’s tail?”\r\n said the mite. We patted the poor horse that grew a tail for urchins to\r\npluck at. Men come to the fathers about their girls. It’s my belief that\r\nmothers more easily say no. If they learn the word as maids, you’ll say!\r\nHowever, there’s no fear about my girl. Fredi’s hard to snare. And what\r\nbrings you Cityward?’\r\n\r\n‘I want to know whether I shall do right in selling out of the Tiddler\r\nmine.’\r\n\r\n‘You have multiplied your investment by ten.’\r\n\r\n‘If it had been thousands!’\r\n\r\n‘Clearly, you sell; always jump out of a mounted mine, unless you’re at\r\nthe bottom of it.’\r\n\r\n‘There are City-articles against the mine this morning--or I should have\r\nbeen on my way to Whinfold at this moment. The shares are lower.’\r\n\r\n‘The merry boys are at work to bring your balloon to the ground, that\r\nyou may quit it for them to ascend. Tiddler has enemies, like the best\r\nof mines: or they may be named lovers, if you like. And mines that have\r\ngone up, go down for a while before they rise again; it’s an affair of\r\nundulations; rocket mines are not so healthy. The stories are false, for\r\nthe time. I had the latest from Dartrey Fenellan yesterday. He’s here\r\nnext month; some time in August.’\r\n\r\n‘He is married, is he not?’\r\n\r\n‘Was.’\r\n\r\nVictor’s brevity sounded oddly to Lady Grace.\r\n\r\n‘Is he not a soldier?’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Soldiers and parsons!’ Victor interjected.\r\n\r\nNow she saw. She understood the portent of Mr. Barmby’s hovering offer\r\nof the choice of songs, and the recent tremulousness of the welling\r\nBethesda.\r\n\r\nBut she had come about her own business; and after remarking, that when\r\nthere is a prize there must be competition, or England will have\r\nto lower her flag, she declared her resolve to stick to Tiddler,\r\nexclaiming: ‘It’s only in mines that twenty times the stake is not a\r\ndream of the past!’\r\n\r\n‘The Riviera green field on the rock is always open to you,’ said\r\nVictor.\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand to be taken. ‘Not if you back me here. It really\r\nis not gambling when yours is the counsel I follow. And if I’m to be\r\na widow, I shall have to lean on a friend, gifted like you. I love\r\nadventure, danger;--well, if we two are in it; just to see my captain\r\nin a storm. And if the worst happens, we go down together. It ‘s the\r\ndetestation of our deadly humdrum of modern life; some inherited love of\r\nfighting.’\r\n\r\n‘Say, brandy.’\r\n\r\n‘Does not Mr. Durance accuse you of an addiction to the brandy novel?’\r\n\r\n‘Colney may call it what he pleases. If I read fiction, let it be\r\nfiction; airier than hard fact. If I see a ballet, my troop of short\r\nskirts must not go stepping like pavement policemen. I can’t read dull\r\nanalytical stuff or “stylists” when I want action--if I’m to give my\r\nmind to a story. I can supply the reflections. I’m English--if Colney\r\n‘s right in saying we always come round to the story with the streak of\r\nsupernaturalism.\r\n\r\nI don’t ask for bloodshed: that’s what his “brandy” means.’\r\n\r\n‘But Mr. Durance is right, we require a shedding; I confess I expect\r\nit where there’s love; it’s part of the balance, and justifies one’s\r\nexcitement. How otherwise do you get any real crisis? I must read and\r\nlive something unlike this flat life around us.’\r\n\r\n‘There’s the Adam life and the Macadam life, Fenellan says. Pass it in\r\nbooks, but in life we can have quite enough excitement coming out of our\r\nthoughts. No brandy there! And no fine name for personal predilections\r\nor things done in domino!’ Victor said, with his very pleasant face,\r\npressing her hand, to keep the act of long holding it in countenance and\r\nbring it to a well-punctuated conclusion: thinking involuntarily of the\r\nother fair woman, whose hand was his, and who betrayed a beaten visage\r\ndespite--or with that poor kind of--trust in her captain. But the\r\nthought was not guilty of drawing comparisons. ‘This is one that I could\r\ntrust, as captain or mate,’ he pressed the hand again before dropping\r\nit.\r\n\r\n‘You judge entirely by the surface, if you take me for a shifty person\r\nat the trial,’ said Lady Grace.\r\n\r\nSkepsey entered the room with one of his packets, and she was reminded\r\nof trains and husbands.\r\n\r\nShe left Victor uncomfortably rufed: and how? for she had none of the\r\nphysical charms appealing peculiarly to the man who was taken with\r\ngrandeur of shape. She belonged rather to the description physically\r\ndistasteful to him.\r\n\r\nIt is a critical comment on a civilization carelessly distilled from the\r\njealous East, when visits of fair women to City offices can have this\r\neffect. If the sexes are separated for an hour, the place where one is\r\nexcluded or not common to see, becomes inflammable to that appearing\r\nspark. He does outrage to a bona Dea: she to the monasticism of the\r\nCourt of Law: and he and she awaken unhallowed emotions. Supposing,\r\nhowever, that western men were to de-orientalize their gleeful notions\r\nof her, and dis-Turk themselves by inviting the woman’s voluble tongue\r\nto sisterly occupation there in the midst of the pleading Court, as\r\nin the domestic circle: very soon would her eyes be harmless: unless\r\ndirected upon us with intent.\r\n\r\nThat is the burning core of the great Question, our Armageddon in\r\nMorality: Is she moral? Does she mean to be harmless? Is she not\r\nuntamable Old Nature? And when once on an equal footing with her lordly\r\nhalf, would not the spangled beauty, in a turn, like the realistic\r\ntransformation-trick of a pantomime, show herself to be that wanton\r\nold thing--the empress of disorderliness? You have to recollect, as the\r\nConservative acutely suggests, that her timidities, at present urging\r\nher to support Establishments, pertain to her state of dependence. The\r\nparty views of Conservatism are, must be, founded, we should remember,\r\non an intimate acquaintance with her in the situations where she\r\nis almost unrestrictedly free and her laughter rings to confirm the\r\nsentences of classical authors and Eastern sages. Conservatives know\r\nwhat they are about when they refuse to fling the last lattice of an\r\nancient harem open to air and sun-the brutal dispersers of mystery,\r\nwhich would despoil an ankle of its flying wink.\r\n\r\nVictor’s opinions were those of the entrenched majority; objecting to\r\nthe occult power of women, as we have the women now, while legislating\r\nto maintain them so; and forbidding a step to a desperately wicked\r\nfemale world lest the step should be to wickeder. His opinions were in\r\nthe background, rarely stirred; but the lady had brought them forward;\r\nand he fretted at his restlessness, vexed that it should be due to the\r\nintrusion of the sex instead of to the charms of the individual. No\r\nsting of the sort had bothered him, he called to mind, on board the\r\nChannel boat-nothing to speak of. ‘Why does she come here! Why didn’t\r\nshe go to her husband! She gets into the City scramble blindfold, and\r\ncatches at the nearest hand to help her out! Nice woman enough.’ Yes,\r\nbut he was annoyed with her for springing sensations that ran altogether\r\nheartless to the object, at the same time that they were disloyal to the\r\ndear woman their natural divinity. And between him and that dear woman,\r\nsince the communication made by Skepsey in the town of Dreux, nightly\r\nthe dividing spirit of Mrs. Burman lay cold as a corpse. They both felt\r\nher there. They kissed coldly, pressed a hand, said good night.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon the announcement by Skepsey of the Hon. Dudley Sowerby,\r\nsurprised Victor’s eyebrows at least, and caused him genially to review\r\nthe visit of Lady Grace.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Colney Durance drew his description of a sunken nobility\r\nfrom the ‘sick falcon’ distinguishing the handsome features of Mr.\r\nSowerby, that beaked invalid was particularly noticeable to Victor\r\nduring the statement of his case, although the young gentleman was far\r\nfrom being one, in Colney’s words, to enliven the condition of domestic\r\nfowl with an hereditary turn for ‘preying’; eminently the reverse; he\r\nwas of good moral repute, a worker, a commendable citizen. But there was\r\nthe obligation upon him to speak--it is expected in such cases, if only\r\nas a formality--of his ‘love’: hard to do even in view and near to the\r\ndamsel’s reddening cheeks: it perplexed him. He dropped a veil on the\r\nbashful topic; his tone was the same as when he reverted to the material\r\npoints; his present income, his position in the great Bank of Shotts\r\nand Co., his prospects, the health of the heir to the Cantor earldom.\r\nHe considered that he spoke to a member of the City merchants, whose\r\npreference for the plain positive, upon the question of an alliance\r\nbetween families by marriage, lends them for once a resemblance\r\nto lords. When a person is not read by character, the position or\r\nprofession is called on to supply raised print for the finger-ends to\r\nspell.\r\n\r\nHard on poor Fredi! was Victor’s thought behind the smile he bent\r\non this bald Cupid. She deserved a more poetical lover! His paternal\r\nsympathies for the girl besought in love, revived his past feelings as\r\na wooer; nothing but a dread of the influence of Mr. Barmby’s toned\r\neloquence upon the girl, after her listening to Dudley Sowerby’s\r\naddresses, checked his contempt for the latter. He could not despise the\r\nsuitor he sided with against another and seemingly now a more dangerous.\r\nUnable quite to repress the sentiment, he proceeded immediately to\r\nput it to his uses. For we have no need to be scrupulously formal and\r\nprecise in the exposition of circumstances to a fellow who may thank the\r\nstars if such a girl condescends to give him a hearing. He had this idea\r\nthrough the conception of his girl’s generosity. And furthermore, the\r\ncognizant eye of a Lucretian Alma Mater having seat so strongly in\r\nVictor, demanded as a right an effusion of the promising amorous graces\r\non the part of the acceptable applicant to the post of husband of\r\nthat peerless. These being absent, evidently non-existent, it seemed\r\nsufficient for the present, after the fashion of the young gentleman, to\r\ncapitulate the few material matters briefly.\r\n\r\nThey were dotted along with a fine disregard of the stateliness of the\r\nsum to be settled on Nesta Victoria, and with a distant but burning wish\r\nall the while, that the suitor had been one to touch his heart and open\r\nit, inspiriting it--as could have been done--to disclose for good and\r\nall the things utterable. Victor loved clear honesty, as he loved light:\r\nand though he hated to be accused of not showing a clean face in the\r\nlight, he would have been moved and lifted to confess to a spot by\r\nthe touch at his heart. Dudley Sowerby’s deficiencies, however, were\r\noutweighed by the palpable advantages of his birth, his prospects, and\r\nhis good repute for conduct; add thereto his gentlemanly manners. Victor\r\nsighed again over his poor Fredi; and in telling Mr. Sowerby that the\r\nchoice must be left to her, he had the regrets of a man aware of\r\nhis persuasive arts and how they would be used, to think that he was\r\nactually making the choice.\r\n\r\nObserve how fatefully he who has a scheme is the engine of it; he is no\r\nlonger the man of his tastes or of his principles; he is on a line of\r\nrails for a terminus; and he may cast languishing eyes across\r\nwaysides to right and left, he has doomed himself to proceed, with a\r\nself-devouring hunger for the half desired; probably manhood gone at\r\nthe embrace of it. This may be or not, but Nature has decreed to him the\r\nforfeit of pleasure. She bids us count the passage of a sober day for\r\nthe service of the morrow; that is her system; and she would have\r\nus adopt it, to keep in us the keen edge for cutting, which is the\r\nguarantee of enjoyment: doing otherwise, we lose ourselves in one or\r\nother of the furious matrix instincts; we are blunt to all else.\r\n\r\nYoung Dudley fully agreed that the choice must be with Miss Radnor;\r\nhe alluded to her virtues, her accomplishments. He was waxing to\r\nfervidness. He said he must expect competitors; adding, on a start,\r\nthat he was to say, from his mother, she, in the case of an intention to\r\npresent Miss Radnor at Court....\r\n\r\nVictor waved hand for a finish, looking as though, his head had come out\r\nof hot water. He sacrificed Royalty to his necessities, under a kind of\r\nsneer at its functions: ‘Court! my girl? But the arduous duties are over\r\nfor the season. We are a democratic people retaining the seductions of\r\nmonarchy, as a friend says; and of course a girl may like to count\r\namong the flowers of the kingdom for a day, in the list of Court\r\npresentations; no harm. Only there’s plenty of time... very young girls\r\nhave their heads turned--though I don’t say, don’t imagine, my girl\r\nwould. By and by perhaps.’\r\n\r\nDudley was ushered into Mr. Inchling’s room and introduced to the\r\nfigure-head of the Firm of Inchling, Pennergate, and Radnor: a\r\nrespectable City merchant indeed, whom Dudley could read-off in a\r\nglimpse of the downright contrast to his partner. He had heard casual\r\nremarks on the respectable City of London merchant from Colney Durance.\r\nA short analytical gaze at him, helped to an estimate of the powers\r\nof the man who kept him up. Mr. Inchling was a florid City-feaster,\r\ndescendant of a line of City merchants, having features for a wife to\r\nidentify; as drovers, they tell us, can single one from another of their\r\nround-bellied beasts. Formerly the leader of the Firm, he was now, after\r\ndreary fits of restiveness, kickings, false prophecies of ruin, Victor’s\r\nobedient cart-horse. He sighed in set terms for the old days of the\r\nFirm, when, like trouts in the current, the Firm had only to gape for\r\nshoals of good things to fatten it: a tale of English prosperity in\r\nquiescence; narrated interjectorily among the by-ways of the City, and\r\nwanting only metre to make it our national Poem.\r\n\r\nMr. Inchling did not deny that grand mangers of golden oats were still\r\nsomehow constantly allotted to him. His wife believed in Victor,\r\nand deemed the loss of the balancing Pennergate a gain. Since that\r\nlamentable loss, Mr. Inchling, under the irony of circumstances the Tory\r\nof Commerce, had trotted and gallopped whither driven, racing like mad\r\nagainst his will and the rival nations now in the field to force the\r\npace; a name for enterprise; the close commercial connection of a man\r\nwho speculated--who, to put it plainly, lived on his wits; hurried\r\nonward and onward; always doubting, munching, grumbling at satisfaction,\r\nin perplexity of the gratitude which is apprehensive of black Nemesis at\r\na turn of the road,--to confound so wild a whip as Victor Radnor. He had\r\nnever forgiven the youth’s venture in India of an enormous purchase\r\nof Cotton many years back, and which he had repudiated, though not his\r\nshare of the hundreds of thousands realized before the refusal to ratify\r\nthe bargain had come to Victor. Mr. Inchling dated his first indigestion\r\nfrom that disquieting period. He assented to the praise of Victor’s\r\ngenius, admitting benefits; his heart refused to pardon, and\r\nconsequently his head wholly to trust, the man who robbed him of his\r\nquondam comfortable feeling of security. And if you will imagine the\r\nsprite of the aggregate English Taxpayer personifying Steam as the\r\nmalignant who has despoiled him of the blessed Safety-Assurance he once\r\nhad from his God Neptune against invaders, you will comprehend the state\r\nof Mr. Inchling’s mind in regard to his terrific and bountiful, but very\r\ndisturbing partner.\r\n\r\nHe thanked heaven to his wife often, that he had nothing to do with\r\nNorth American or South American mines and pastures or with South Africa\r\nand, gold and diamonds: and a wife must sometimes listen, mastering her\r\ninward comparisons. Dr. Schlesien had met and meditated on this example\r\nof the island energy. Mr. Inchling was not permitted by his wife to be\r\nmuch the guest of the Radnor household, because of the frequent meeting\r\nthere with Colney Durance; Colney’s humour for satire being instantly in\r\nbristle at sight of his representative of English City merchants:\r\n‘over whom,’ as he wrote of the venerable body, ‘the disciplined and\r\ninstructed Germans not deviously march; whom acute and adventurous\r\nAmericans, with half a cock of the eye in passing, compassionately\r\noutstrip.’ He and Dr. Schlesien agreed upon Mr. Inchling. Meantime\r\nthe latter gentleman did his part at the tables of the wealthier City\r\nCompanies, and retained his appearance of health; he was beginning to\r\nthink, upon a calculation of the increased treasures of those Companies\r\nand the country, that we, the Taxpayer, ought not to leave it altogether\r\nto Providence to defend them; notwithstanding the watchful care of us\r\nhitherto shown by our briny Providence, to save us from anxiety and\r\nexpense. But there are, he said, ‘difficulties’; and the very word\r\ncould stop him, as commonly when our difficulty lies in the exercise of\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nVictor’s African room, containing large wall-maps of auriferous regions,\r\nwas inspected; and another, where clerks were busy over miscellaneous\r\nContinents. Dudley Sowerby hoped he might win the maiden.\r\n\r\nHe and Victor walked in company Westward. The shop of Boyle and\r\nLuckwort, chemists, was not passed on this occasion. Dudley grieved that\r\nhe had to be absent from the next Concert for practise, owing to his\r\nengagement to his mother to go down to the family seat near Tunbridge\r\nWells. Victor mentioned his relatives, the Duvidney maiden ladies,\r\nresiding near the Wells. They measured the distance between Cronidge and\r\nMoorsedge, the two houses, as for half an hour on horseback.\r\n\r\nNesta told her father at home that the pair of them had been observed\r\nconfidentially arm in arm, and conversing so profoundly.\r\n\r\n‘Who, do you think, was the topic?’ Victor asked.\r\n\r\nShe would not chase the little blue butterfly of a guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. TREATS OF NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE DISSENSION\r\nBETWEEN THEM AND OF A SATIRIST’S MALIGNITY IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS\r\nCOUNTRY\r\n\r\nThere is at times in the hearts of all men of active life a vivid wild\r\nmoment or two of dramatic dialogue between the veteran antagonists,\r\nNature and Circumstance, when they, whose business it should be to be\r\njoyfully one, furiously split; and the Dame is up with her shrillest\r\nquerulousness to inquire of her offspring, for the distinct original\r\nmotive of his conduct. Why did he bring her to such a pass! And what is\r\nthe gain? If he be not an alienated issue of the great Mother, he will\r\nstrongly incline to her view, that he put himself into harness to join\r\nwith a machine going the dead contrary way of her welfare; and thereby\r\nwrote himself donkey, for his present reading. Soldiers, heroes, even\r\nthe braided, even the wearers of the gay cock’s feathers, who get\r\nthe honours and the pocket-pieces, know the moment of her electrical\r\neloquence. They have no answer for her, save an index at the machine\r\npushing them on yet farther under the enemy’s line of fire, where they\r\npluck the golden wreath or the livid, and in either case listen no more.\r\nThey glorify her topping wisdom while on the march to confound it.\r\nShe is wise in her way. But, it is asked by the disputant, If we had\r\nfollowed her exclusively, how far should we have travelled from our\r\nstarting-point? We of the world and its prizes and duties must do her\r\nan injury to make her tongue musical to us, and her argument worthy of\r\nattention. So it seems. How to keep the proper balance between those two\r\ntesty old wranglers, that rarely pull the right way together, is as much\r\nthe task for men in the grip of the world, as for the wanton youthful\r\nfry under dominion of their instincts; and probably, when it is done,\r\nman will have attained the golden age of his retirement from service.\r\n\r\nWhy be scheming? Victor asked. Unlike the gallant soldiery, his question\r\nwas raised in the blush of a success, from an examination of the\r\nquality of the thing won; although it had not changed since it was first\r\ncoveted; it was demonstrably the same: and an astonishing dry stick\r\nhe held, as a reward for perpetual agitations and perversions of his\r\nnatural tastes. Here was a Dudley Sowerby, the direct issue of the\r\nconception of Lakelands; if indeed they were not conceived together\r\nin one; and the young gentleman had moral character, good citizen\r\nsubstance, and station, rank, prospect of a title; and the grasp of him\r\nwas firm. Yet so far was it from hearty, that when hearing a professed\r\nsatirist like Colney Durance remark on the decorous manner of Dudley’s\r\ntransparent courtship of the girl, under his look of an awakened\r\napproval of himself, that he appeared to be asking everybody:--Do you\r\nnot think I bid fair for an excellent father of Philistines?--Victor had\r\na nip of spite at the thought of Dudley’s dragging him bodily to be the\r\ngrandfather. Poor Fredi, too!--necessarily the mother: condemned by\r\nher hard fate to feel proud of Philistine babies! Though women soon get\r\nreconciled to it! Or do they? They did once. What if his Fredi turned\r\nout one of the modern young women, who have drunk of ideas? He caught\r\nhimself speculating on that, as on a danger. The alliance with Dudley\r\nreally seemed to set him facing backward.\r\n\r\nColney might not have been under prompting of Nataly when he derided\r\nDudley; but Victor was at war with the picture of her, in her\r\ncompression of a cruel laugh, while her eyelids were hard shut, as if to\r\nexclude the young patriarch of Philistines’ ridiculous image.\r\n\r\nHe hearkened to the Nature interrogating him, why had he stepped on a\r\npath to put division between himself and his beloved?--the smallest\r\nof gaps; and still the very smallest between nuptial lovers is a\r\ndivision--and that may become a mortal wound to their one-life. Why\r\nhad he roused a slumbering world? Glimpses of the world’s nurse-like,\r\nold-fashioned, mother-nightcap benevolence to its kicking favourites;\r\nits long-suffering tolerance for the heroic breakers of its rough-cast\r\nlaws, while the decent curtain continues dropped, or lifted only\r\nankle-high; together with many scenes, lively suggestions, of the\r\nchoice of ways he liked best, told of things, which were better things,\r\nincomprehensibly forfeited. So that the plain sense of value insisted on\r\nmore than one weighing of the gain in hand: a dubious measure.\r\n\r\nHe was as little disposed to reject it as to stop his course at a\r\ngoal of his aim. Nevertheless, a gain thus poorly estimated, could not\r\ncommand him to do a deed of humiliation on account of it. The speaking\r\nto this dry young Dudley was not imperative at present. A word would do\r\nin the day to come.\r\n\r\nNataly was busy with her purchases of furniture, and the practise for\r\nthe great August Concert. He dealt her liberal encouragements, up to the\r\nverge of Dr. Themison’s latest hummed words touching Mrs. Burman, from\r\nwhich he jumped in alarm lest he should paralyze her again: the dear\r\nsoul’s dreaded aspect of an earthy pallor was a spectre behind her\r\ncheeks, ready to rush forth. Fenellan brought Carling to dine with him;\r\nand Themison was confirmed by Carting, with incidents in proof; Caning\r\nby Jarniman, also with incidents; one very odd one--or so it seemed, in\r\nthe fury of the first savour of it:--she informed Jarniman, Skepsey said\r\nhis friend Jarniman said, that she had dreamed of making her appearance\r\nto him on the night of the 23rd August, and of setting the date on the\r\ncalendar over his desk, when she entered his room: ‘Sitting-room, not\r\nbedroom; she was always quite the lady,’ Skepsey reported his Jarniman.\r\nMrs. Burman, as a ghost, would respect herself; she would keep to her\r\ncharacter. Jarniman quite expected the dream to be verified; she was\r\na woman of her word: he believed she had received a revelation of the\r\napproaching fact: he was preparing for the scene.\r\n\r\nVictor had to keep silent and discourse of general prosperity. His happy\r\nvivaciousness assisted him to feel it by day. Nataly heard him at night,\r\non a moan: ‘Poor soul!’ and loudly once while performing an abrupt\r\ndemi-vault from back to side: ‘Perhaps now!’ in a voice through doors.\r\nShe schooled herself to breathe equably.\r\n\r\nNot being allowed to impart the distressing dose of comfort he was\r\ncharged with, he swallowed it himself; and these were the consequences.\r\nAnd an uneasy sleep was traditionally a matter for grave debate in the\r\nRadnor family. The Duvidney ladies, Dorothea and Virginia, would have\r\ncited ancestral names, showing it to be the worst of intimations. At\r\nnight, lying on his back beneath a weight of darkness, one heavily\r\ncraped figure, distinguishable through the gloom, as a blot on a black\r\npad, accused the answering darkness within him, until his mind\r\nwas dragged to go through the whole case by morning light; and the\r\ncompassionate man appealed to common sense, to stamp and pass his\r\ndelectable sophistries; as, that it was his intense humaneness, which\r\nexposed him to an accusation of inhumanity; his prayer for the truly\r\nbest to happen, which anticipated Mrs. Burman’s expiry. They were simple\r\nsophistries, fabricated to suit his needs, readily taking and bearing\r\nthe imprimatur of common sense. They refreshed him, as a chemical scent\r\na crowded room.\r\n\r\nAll because he could not open his breast to Nataly, by reason of her\r\nfeebleness; or feel enthusiasm in the possession of young Dudley! A\r\ndry stick indeed beside him on the walk Westward. Good quality wood, no\r\ndoubt, but dry, varnished for conventional uses. Poor dear Fredi would\r\nhave to crown it like the May-day posy of the urchins of Craye Farm and\r\nCreckholt!\r\n\r\nDudley wished the great City-merchant to appreciate him as a diligent\r\nstudent of commercial matters: rivalries of Banks; Foreign and Municipal\r\nLoans, American Rails, and Argentine; new Companies of wholesome\r\nappearance or sinister; or starting with a dram in the stomach, or born\r\nto bleat prostrate, like sheep on their backs in a ditch; Trusts and\r\nFounders; Breweries bursting vats upon the markets, and England\r\nprone along the gutters, gobbling, drunk for shares, and sober in the\r\npossession of certain of them. But when, as Colney says, a grateful\r\nEngland has conferred the Lordship on her Brewer, he gratefully\r\nhands-over the establishment to his country; and both may disregard the\r\nhowls of a Salvation Army of shareholders.--Beaten by the Germans in\r\nBrewery, too! Dr. Schlesien has his right to crow. We were ahead of\r\nthem, and they came and studied us, and they studied Chemistry as well;\r\nwhile we went on down our happy-go-lucky old road; and then had to hire\r\ntheir young Professors, and then to import their beer.\r\n\r\nHave the Germans more brains than we English? Victor’s blood up to the\r\ndome of his cranium knocked the patriotic negative. But, as old Colney\r\nsays (and bother him, for constantly intruding!), the comfortably\r\nsuccessful have the habit of sitting, and that dulls the brain yet more\r\nthan it eases the person: hence are we outpaced; we have now to know\r\nwe are racing. Victor scored a mark for one of his projects. A\r\nwell-conducted Journal of the sharpest pens in the land might, at a\r\nsacrifice of money grandly sunk, expose to his English how and to what\r\ndegree their sports, and their fierce feastings, and their opposition to\r\nideas, and their timidity in regard to change, and their execration of\r\ncriticism applied to themselves, and their unanimous adoption of it\r\nfor a weapon against others, are signs of a prolonged indulgence in the\r\ncushioned seat. Victor saw it. But would the people he loved? He\r\nagreed with Colney, forgetting the satirist’s venom: to-wit; that the\r\njournalists should be close under their editor’s rod to put it in sound\r\nbold English;--no metaphors, no similes, nor flowery insubstantiality:\r\nbut honest Saxon manger stuff: and put it repeatedly, in contempt of the\r\ndisgust of iteration; hammering so a soft place on the Anglican skull,\r\nwhich is rubbed in consequence, and taught at last through soreness\r\nto reflect.--A Journal?--with Colney Durance for Editor?--and\r\ncalled conformably THE WHIPPING-TOP? Why not, if it exactly hits the\r\nsignification of the Journal and that which it would have the country do\r\nto itself, to keep it going and truly topping? For there is no vulgarity\r\nin a title strongly signifying the intent. Victor wrote it at night,\r\nnaming Colney for Editor, with a sum of his money to be devoted to the\r\npublication, in a form of memorandum; and threw it among the papers in\r\nhis desk.\r\n\r\nYoung Dudley had a funny inquisitiveness about Dartrey Fenellan; owing\r\nto Fredi’s reproduction or imitation of her mother’s romantic sentiment\r\nfor Dartrey, doubtless: a bit of jealousy, indicating that the dry\r\nfellow had his feelings. Victor touched--off an outline of Dartrey’s\r\nhistory and character:--the half-brother of Simeon, considerably\r\nyounger, and totally different. ‘Dartrey’s mother was Lady Charlotte\r\nKiltorne, one of the Clanconans; better mother than wife, perhaps; and\r\nno reproach on her, not a shadow; only she made the General’s Bank-notes\r\nfly black paper. And--if you ‘re for heredity--the queer point is,\r\nthat Simeon, whose mother was a sober-minded woman, has always been the\r\nspendthrift. Dartrey married one of the Hennen women, all an odd lot,\r\nall handsome. I met her once. Colney said, she came up here with a\r\nspecial commission from the Prince of Darkness. There are women who stir\r\nthe unholy in men--whether they mean it or not, you know.’\r\n\r\nDudley pursed to remark, that he could not say he did know. And good for\r\nFredi if he did not know, and had his objections to the knowledge! But\r\nhe was like the men who escape colds by wrapping in comforters instead\r\nof trusting to the spin of the blood.\r\n\r\n‘She played poor Dartrey pranks before he buried--he, behaved well to\r\nher; and that says much for him; he has: a devil of a temper. I ‘ve seen\r\nthe blood in his veins, mount to cracking. But there’s the man: because\r\nshe was a woman, he never let it break out with her. And, by heaven,\r\nhe had cause. She couldn’t be left. She tricked him, and she loved\r\nhim-passionately, I believe. You don’t understand women loving the\r\nhusband they drag through the mire?’\r\n\r\nDudley did not. He sharpened his mouth.\r\n\r\n‘Buried, you said, sir?--a widower?’\r\n\r\n‘I’ve no positive information; we shall hear when he: comes back,’\r\nVictor replied hurriedly. ‘He got a drenching of all the damns in the\r\nBritish service from his. Generalissimo one day at a Review, for a\r\ntrooper’s negligence-button or stock missing, or something; and off goes\r\nDartrey to his hut, and breaks his sword, and sends in his resignation.\r\nGood soldier lost. And I can’t complain; he has been a right-hand man to\r\nme over in Africa. But a man ought to have some control of his temper,\r\nespecially a soldier.’\r\n\r\nDudley put emphasis into his acquiescence.\r\n\r\n‘Worse than that temper of Dartrey’s, he can’t forgive an injury. He\r\nbears a grudge against his country. You’ve heard Colney Durance abuse\r\nold England. It’s three parts factitious-literary exercise. It ‘s milk\r\nbeside the contempt of Dartrey’s shrug. He thinks we’re a dead people,\r\nif a people; “subsisting on our fat,” as Colney says.’\r\n\r\n‘I am not of opinion that we show it,’ observed Dudley.\r\n\r\n‘We don’t,’ Victor agreed. He disrelished his companion’s mincing tone\r\nof a monumental security, and yearned for Dartrey or Simeon or Colney to\r\nbe at his elbow rather than this most commendable of orderly citizens,\r\nwho little imagined the treacherous revolt from him in the bosom of the\r\ngentleman cordially signifying full agreement. But Dudley was not gifted\r\nto read behind words and looks.\r\n\r\nThey were in the Park of the dwindling press of carriages, and here was\r\nthis young Dudley saying, quite commendably: ‘It’s a pity we seem to\r\nhave no means of keeping our parks select.’\r\n\r\nVictor flung Simeon Fenellan at him in thought. He remembered a fable of\r\nFenellan’s, about a Society of the Blest, and the salt it was to them to\r\ndiscover an intruder from below, and the consequent accelerated measure\r\nin their hymning.\r\n\r\n‘Have you seen anything offensive to you?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘One sees notorious persons.’\r\n\r\nDudley spoke aloof from them--‘out of his cold attics,’ Fenellan would\r\nhave said.\r\n\r\nVictor approved: with the deadened feeling common to us when first in\r\nsad earnest we consent to take life as it is.\r\n\r\nHe perceived, too, the comicality of his having to resign himself to the\r\nfatherly embrace of goodness.\r\n\r\nLakelands had him fast, and this young Dudley was the kernel of\r\nLakelands. If he had only been intellectually a little flexible in his\r\nmorality! But no; he wore it cap a pie, like a mediaeval knight his\r\narmour. One had to approve. And there was no getting away from him. He\r\nwas good enough to stay in town for the practise of the opening overture\r\nof the amateurs, and the flute-duet, when his family were looking for\r\nhim at Tunbridge Wells; and almost every day Victor was waylaid by him\r\nat a corner of the Strand.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, Victor appeared at the point of interception armed\r\nwith Colney Durance, for whom he had called in the Temple, bent on\r\nself-defence, although Colney was often as bitter to his taste as to\r\nDudley’s. Latterly the bitter had become a tonic. We rejoice in the\r\npresence of goodness, let us hope; and still an impersonation of\r\nconventional, goodness perpetually about us depresses. Dudley drove\r\nhim to Colney for relief. Besides it pleased Nataly that he should be\r\nbringing Colney home; it looked to her as if he were subjecting Dudley\r\nto critical inspection before he decided a certain question much, and\r\nfoolishly, dreaded by the dear soul. That quieted her. And another\r\nthing, she liked him to be with Colney, for a clog on him; as it were, a\r\ntuning-fork for the wild airs he started. A little pessimism, also, she\r\nseemed to like; probably as an appeasement after hearing, and having\r\nto share, high flights. And she was, in her queer woman’s way, always\r\nreassured by his endurance of Colney’s company:--she read it to mean,\r\nthat he could bear Colney’s perusal of him, and satiric stings. Victor\r\nhad seen these petty matters among the various which were made to serve\r\nhis double and treble purposes; now, thanks to the operation of young\r\nDudley within him, he felt them. Preferring Fenellan’s easy humour to\r\nColney’s acid, he was nevertheless braced by the latter’s antidote to\r\nDudley, while reserving his entire opposition in the abstract.\r\n\r\nFor Victor Radnor and Colney Durance were the Optimist and Pessimist of\r\ntheir society. They might have headed those tribes in the country. At a\r\nperiod when the omnibus of the world appears to its quaint occupants\r\nto be going faster, men are shaken into the acceptation, if not\r\nperformance, of one part or the other as it is dictated to them by their\r\ntemperaments. Compose the parts, and you come nigh to the meaning of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century: the mother of these gosling affirmatives and\r\nnegatives divorced from harmony and awakened by the slight increase\r\nof incubating motion to vitality. Victor and Colney had been champion\r\nduellists for the rosy and the saturnine since the former cheerfully\r\nslaved for a small stipend in the City of his affection, and the latter\r\nentered on an inheritance counted in niggard hundreds, that withdrew\r\na briefless barrister disposed for scholarship from the forlornest\r\nof seats in the Courts. They had foretold of one another each the\r\nunfulfilled; each claimed the actual as the child of his prediction.\r\nVictor was to have been ruined long back; Colney the prey of independent\r\nbachelors. Colney had escaped his harpy, and Victor could be called a\r\nmillionaire and more. Prophesy was crowned by Colney’s dyspepsia, by\r\nVictor’s ticklish domestic position. Their pity for one another, their\r\nwarm regard, was genuine; only, they were of different temperaments;\r\nand we have to distinguish, that in many estimable and some gifted human\r\ncreatures, it is the quality of the blood which directs the current of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nVictor played-off Colney upon Dudley, for his internal satisfaction, and\r\nto lull Nataly and make her laugh; but he could not, as she hoped he\r\nwas doing, take Colney into his confidence; inasmuch as the Optimist,\r\nimpelled by his exuberant anticipatory trustfulness, is an author, and\r\ndoes things; whereas the Pessimist is your chaired critic, with the\r\ndelivery of a censor, generally an undoer of things. Our Optimy has\r\nhis instinct to tell him of the cast of Pessimy’s countenance at the\r\nconfession of a dilemma-foreseen! He hands himself to Pessimy, as it\r\nwere a sugar-cane, for the sour brute to suck the sugar and whack\r\nwith the wood. But he cannot perform his part in return; he gets no\r\ncompensation: Pessimy is invulnerable. You waste your time in hurling a\r\ncommon ‘tu-quoque’ at one who hugs the worst.\r\n\r\nThe three walking in the park, with their bright view, and black view,\r\nand neutral view of life, were a comical trio. They had come upon the\r\ndays of the unfanned electric furnace, proper to London’s early August\r\nwhen it is not pipeing March. Victor complacently bore heat as well as\r\ncold: but young Dudley was a drought, and Colney a drug to refresh it;\r\nand why was he stewing in London? It was for this young Dudley, who\r\nresembled a London of the sparrowy roadways and wearisome pavements and\r\nblocks of fortress mansions, by chance a water-cart spirting a stale\r\nwater: or a London of the farewell dinner-parties, where London’s\r\nprofessed anecdotist lays the dust with his ten times told: Why was not\r\nNataly relieved of her dreary round of the purchases of furniture! They\r\nought all now to be in Switzerland or Tyrol. Nesta had of late been\r\nturning over leaves of an Illustrated book of Tyrol, dear to her after\r\na run through the Innthal to the Dolomites one splendid August; and she\r\nand Nataly had read there of Hofer, Speckbacker, Haspinger; and wrath\r\nhad filled them at the meanness of the Corsican, who posed after it\r\nas victim on St. Helena’s rock; the scene in grey dawn on Mantua’s\r\nfortress-walls blasting him in the Courts of History, when he strikes\r\nfor his pathetic sublime.\r\n\r\nVictor remembered how he had been rhetorical, as the mouthpiece of\r\nhis darlings. But he had in memory prominently now the many glorious\r\npictures of that mountain-land beckoning to him, waving him to fly forth\r\nfrom the London oven:--lo, the Tyrolese limestone crags with livid peaks\r\nand snow lining shelves and veins of the crevices; and folds of pinewood\r\nundulations closed by a shoulder of snow large on the blue; and a\r\ndazzling pinnacle rising over green pasture-Alps, the head of it\r\nshooting aloft as the blown billow, high off a broken ridge, and\r\nwide-armed in its pure white shroud beneath; tranced, but all motion in\r\nimmobility, to the heart in the eye; a splendid image of striving, up to\r\ncrowned victory. And see the long valley-sweeps of the hanging meadows\r\nand maize, and lower vineyards and central tall green spires! Walking\r\nbeside young Dudley, conversing, observing too, Victor followed the\r\ntrips and twists of a rill, that was lured a little further down through\r\nscoops, ducts, and scaffolded channels to serve a wainwright.\r\n\r\nHe heard the mountain-song of the joyful water: a wren-robin-thrush on\r\nthe dance down of a faun; till it was caught and muted, and the silver\r\nfoot slid along the channel, swift as moonbeams through a cloud, with an\r\nair of ‘Whither you will, so it be on’; happy for service as in freedom.\r\nThen the yard of the inn below, and the rillwater twirling rounded\r\nthrough the trout-trough, subdued, still lively for its beloved onward:\r\ndues to business, dues to pleasure; a wedding of the two, and the wisest\r\non earth:-eh? like some one we know, and Nataly has made the comparison.\r\nFresh forellen for lunch: rhyming to Fenellan, he had said to her; and\r\nthat recollection struck the day to blaze; for his friend was a ruined\r\nmilitary captain living on a literary quill at the time; and Nataly’s\r\ntender pleading, ‘Could you not help to give him another chance, dear\r\nVictor?’--signifying her absolute trust in his ability to do that or\r\nmore or anything, had actually set him thinking of the Insurance Office;\r\nwhich he started to prosperity, and Fenellan in it, previously an\r\nuntutored rill of the mountains, if ever was one.\r\n\r\nUseless to be dwelling on holiday pictures: Lakelands had hold of him!\r\n\r\nColney or somebody says, that the greater our successes, the greater the\r\nslaves we become.--But we must have an aim, my friend, and success must\r\nbe the aim of any aim!--Yes, and, says Colney, you are to rejoice in the\r\ndisappointing miss, which saved you from being damned by your bullet on\r\nthe centre.--You’re dead against Nature, old Colney.--That is to carry\r\nthe flag of Liberty.--By clipping a limb!\r\n\r\nVictor overcame the Pessimist in his own royal cranium-Court. He\r\nentertained a pronounced dissension with bachelors pretending to\r\nindependence. It could not be argued publicly, and the more the\r\npity:--for a slight encouragement, he would have done it: his\r\noutlook over the waves of bachelors and (by present conditions mostly\r\nconstrained) spinsters--and another outlook, midnight upon Phlegethon to\r\nthe thoughts of men, made him deem it urgent. And it helped the plea in\r\nhis own excuse, as Colney pointed out to the son of Nature. That, he\r\nhad to admit, was true. He charged it upon Mrs. Burman, for twisting the\r\nmost unselfish and noblest of his thoughts; and he promised himself\r\nit was to cease on the instant when the circumstance, which Nature was\r\nremiss in not bringing about to-day or to-morrow, had come to pass. He\r\ncould see his Nataly’s pained endurance beneath her habitual submission.\r\nHer effort was a poor one, to conceal her dread of the day of the\r\ngathering at Lakelands.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday previous to the day, Dr. Themison accompanied the\r\namateurs by rail to Wrensham, to hear ‘trial of the acoustics’ of the\r\nConcert-hall. They were a goodly company; and there was fun in the\r\nrailway-carriage over Colney’s description of Fashionable London’s vast\r\noctopus Malady-monster, who was letting the doctor fly to the tether of\r\nits longest filament for an hour, plying suckers on him the while. He\r\nhad the look, to general perception, of a man but half-escaped: and as\r\nwhen the notes of things taken by the vision in front are being set down\r\nupon tablets in the head behind. Victor observed his look at Nataly. The\r\nlook was like a door aswing, revealing in concealing. She was not or did\r\nnot appear struck by it; perhaps, if observant, she took it for a busy\r\nprofessional gentleman’s holiday reckoning of the hours before the\r\nreturn train to his harness, and his arrangements for catching it. She\r\nwas, as she could be on a day of trial, her enchanting majestic self\r\nagain--defying suspicions. She was his true mate for breasting a world\r\nhonoured in uplifting her.\r\n\r\nHer singing of a duet with Nesta, called forth Dr. Themison’s very warm\r\napplause. He named the greatest of contraltos. Colney did better service\r\nthan Fenellan at the luncheon-table: he diverted Nataly and captured\r\nDr. Themison’s ear with the narrative of his momentous expedition of\r\nEuropean Emissaries, to plead the cause of their several languages at\r\nthe Court of Japan: a Satiric Serial tale, that hit incidentally the\r\nfollies of the countries of Europe, and intentionally, one had to think,\r\nthose of Old England. Nesta set him going. Just when he was about\r\nto begin, she made her father laugh by crying out in a rapture, ‘Oh!\r\nDelphica!’ For she was naughtily aware of Dudley Sowerby’s distaste for\r\nthe story and disgust with the damsel Delphica.\r\n\r\nNesta gave Dr. Themison the preliminary sketch of the grand object of\r\nthe expedition: indeed one of the eminent ones of the world; matter\r\nfor an Epic; though it is to be feared, that our part in it will not\r\nencourage a Cis-Atlantic bard. To America the honours from beginning to\r\nend belong.\r\n\r\nSo, then, Japan has decided to renounce its language, for the adoption\r\nof the language it may choose among the foremost famous European\r\ntongues. Japan becomes the word for miraculous transformations of a\r\nwhole people at the stroke of a wand; and let our English enrol it as\r\nthe most precious of the powerful verbs. An envoy visits the principal\r\nSeats of Learning in Europe. He is of a gravity to match that of his\r\nunexampled and all but stupefying mission. A fluent linguist, yet an\r\nEnglishman, the slight American accent contracted during a lengthened\r\nresidence in the United States is no bar to the patriotism urging him\r\nto pay his visit of exposition and invitation from the Japanese Court\r\nto the distinguished Doctor of Divinity Dr. Bouthoin. The renown of Dr.\r\nBouthoin among the learned of Japan has caused the special invitation to\r\nhim; a scholar endowed by an ample knowledge and persuasive eloquence to\r\ncite and instance as well as illustrate the superior advantages to Japan\r\nand civilization in the filial embrace of mother English. ‘For to this\r\nit must come predestinated,’ says the astonishing applicant. ‘We seem\r\nto see a fitness in it,’ says the cogitative Rev. Doctor. ‘And an Island\r\nEngland in those waters, will do wonders for Commerce,’ adds the former.\r\n‘We think of things more pregnant,’ concludes the latter, with a dry\r\ngleam of ecclesiastical knowingness. And let the Editor of the Review\r\nupon his recent pamphlet, and let the prelate reprimanding him, and let\r\nthe newspapers criticizing his pure Saxon, have a care!\r\n\r\nFunds, universally the most convincing of credentials, are placed at\r\nDr. Bouthoin’s disposal: only it is requested, that for the present the\r\nexpedition be secret. ‘Better so,’ says pure Saxon’s champion. On a\r\nday patented for secresy, and swearing-in the whole American Continent\r\nthrough the cables to keep the secret by declaring the patent, the Rev.\r\nDr. Bouthoin, accompanied by his curate, the Rev. Mancate Semhians,\r\nstumbling across portmanteaux crammed with lexicons and dictionaries and\r\nother tubes of the voice of Hermes, takes possession of berths in\r\nthe ship Polypheme, bound, as they mutually conceive, for the biggest\r\nadventure ever embarked on by a far-thoughted, high-thoughted, patriotic\r\npair speaking pure Saxon or other.\r\n\r\nColney, with apologies to his hearers, avoided the custom of our period\r\n(called the Realistic) to create, when casual opportunity offers, a\r\nbelief in the narrative by promoting nausea in the audience. He passed\r\nunder veil the Rev. Doctor’s acknowledgement of Neptune’s power, and the\r\ntemporary collapse of Mr. Semhians. Proceeding at once to the comments\r\nof these high-class missionaries on the really curious inquisitiveness\r\nof certain of the foreign passengers on board, he introduced to them\r\nthe indisputably learned, the very argumentative, crashing, arrogant,\r\npedantic, dogmatic, philological German gentleman, Dr. Gannius, reeking\r\nof the Teutonic Professor, as a library volume of its leather. With him\r\nis his fairhaired artless daughter Delphica. An interesting couple for\r\nthe beguilement of a voyage: she so beautifully moderates his irascible\r\nincisiveness! Yet there is a strange tone that they have. What, then,\r\nof the polite, the anecdotic Gallic M. Falarique, who studiously engages\r\nthe young lady in colloquy when Mr. Semhians is agitating outside them\r\nto say a word? What of that outpouring, explosive, equally voluble,\r\nuncontrolled M. Bobinikine, a Mongol Russian, shaped, featured, hued\r\nlike the pot-boiled, round and tight young dumpling of our primitive\r\nboyhood, which smokes on the dish from the pot? And what of another,\r\nhitherto unnoticed, whose nose is of the hooked vulturine, whose name\r\ntranspires as Pisistratus Mytharete? He hears Dr. Bouthoin declaim some\r\nlines of Homer, and beseeches him for the designation of that language.\r\nGreek, is it? Greek of the Asiatic ancient days of the beginning of\r\nthe poetic chants? Dr. Gannius crashes cachinnation. Dr. Bouthoin caps\r\nhimself with the offended Don. Mr. Semhians opens half an eye and a\r\nwhole mouth. There must be a mystery, these two exclaim to one another\r\nin privacy. Delphica draws Mr. Semhians aside.\r\n\r\nBlushing over his white necktie, like the coast of Labrador at the\r\ntransient wink of its Jack-in-the-box Apollo, Mr. Semhians faintly tells\r\nof a conversation he has had with the ingenuous fair one; and she ardent\r\nas he for the throning of our incomparable Saxon English in the mouths\r\nof the races of mankind. Strange!--she partly suspects the Frenchman,\r\nthe Russian, the attentive silent Greek, to be all of them bound for the\r\nCourt of Japan. Concurrents? Can it be? We are absolutely to enter on\r\na contention with rivals? Dr. Bouthoin speaks to Dr. Gannius. He is\r\nastonished, he says; he could not have imagined it!\r\n\r\n‘Have you ever imagined anything?’ Dr. Gannius asks him. Entomologist,\r\nbotanist, palaeontologist, philologist, and at sound of horn a ready\r\nregimental corporal, Dr. Gannius wears good manners as a pair of\r\nbath-slippers, to rally and kick his old infant of an Englishman; who,\r\nin awe of his later renown and manifest might, makes it a point of\r\ndiscretion to be ultra-amiable; for he certainly is not in training, he\r\nhas no alliances, and he must diplomatize; and the German is a strong\r\none; a relative too; he is the Saxon’s cousin, to say the least.\r\nThis German has the habit of pushing past politeness to carry his\r\nargumentative war into the enemy’s country: and he presents on all sides\r\na solid rampart of recent great deeds done, and mailed readiness for the\r\ndoing of more, if we think of assailing him in that way. We are really\r\nlike the poor beasts which have cast their shells or cases, helpless\r\nflesh to his beak. So we are cousinly.\r\n\r\nWhether more amused than amazed, we know not, Dr. Gannius hears from\r\n‘our simpleton of the pastures,’ as he calls the Rev. Doctor to his\r\ndaughter, that he and Mr. Semhians have absolutely pushed forth\r\nupon this most mighty of enterprises naked of any backing from their\r\nGovernment! Babes in the Wood that they are! ‘a la grace de dieu’\r\nat every turn that cries for astutia, they show no sign or symbol of\r\nEnglish arms behind them, to support--and with the grandest of national\r\nprizes in view!--the pleading oration before the Court of the elect,\r\nerudites, we will call them, of an intelligent, yet half barbarous,\r\npeople; hesitating, these, between eloquence and rival eloquence,\r\ncunning and rival cunning. Why, in such a case, the shadow-nimbus of\r\nForce is needed to decide the sinking of the scale. But have these\r\nEnglish never read their Shakespeare, that they show so barren an\r\nacquaintance with human, to say nothing of semi-barbaric, nature? But\r\nit is here that we Germans prove our claim to being the sons of his\r\nmind.--Dr. Gannius, in contempt, throws off the mask: he also is a\r\nconcurrent. And not only is he the chosen by election of the chief\r\nUniversities of his land, he has behind him, as Athene dilating\r\nAchilles, the clenched fist of the Prince of thunder and lightning of\r\nhis time. German, Japan shall be! he publicly swears before them all.\r\nM. Falarique damascenes his sharpest smile; M. Bobinikine double-dimples\r\nhis puddingest; M. Mytharete rolls a forefinger over his beak; Dr.\r\nBouthoin enlarges his eye on a sunny mote. And such is the masterful\r\neffect of a frank diplomacy, that when one party shows his hand, the\r\nothers find the reverse of concealment in hiding their own.\r\n\r\nDr. Bouthoin and Mr. Semhians are compelled to suspect themselves to be\r\nencompassed with rivals, presumptively supported by their Governments.\r\nThe worthy gentlemen had hoped to tumble into good fortune, as in the\r\nblessed old English manner. ‘It has even been thus with us: unhelped we\r\ndo it!’ exclaims the Rev. Doctor. He is roused from dejection by hearing\r\nMr. Semhians shyly (he has published verse) tell of the fairtressed\r\nDelphica’s phosphorial enthusiasm for our galaxy of British Poets.\r\nAssisted by Mr. Semhians, he begins to imagine, that he has, in the\r\nperson of this artless devotee an ally, who will, through her worship\r\nof our poets (by treachery to her sire-a small matter) sacrifice her\r\nguttural tongue, by enabling him (through the exercise of her arts,\r\ncharms, intrigues--also a small matter) to obtain the first audience\r\nof the Japanese erudites. Delphica, with each of the rivals in turn,\r\nis very pretty Comedy. She is aware that M. Falarique is her most\r\nredoubtable adversary, by the time that the vast fleet of steamboats\r\n(containing newspaper reporters) is beheld from the decks of the\r\nPolypheme puffing past Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nThere Colney left them, for the next instalment of the serial.\r\n\r\nNesta glanced at Dudley Sowerby. She liked him for his pained frown at\r\nthe part his countrymen were made to play, but did wish that he would\r\nkeep from expressing it in a countenance that suggested a worried knot;\r\nand mischievously she said: ‘Do you take to Delphica?’\r\n\r\nHe replied, with an evident sincerity, ‘I cannot say I do.’\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Semhians been modelled on him?\r\n\r\n‘One bets on the German, of course--with Colney Durance,’ Victor said to\r\nDr. Themison, leading him over the grounds of Lakelands.\r\n\r\n‘In any case, the author teaches us to feel an interest in the rivals. I\r\nwant to know what comes of it,’ said the doctor.\r\n\r\n‘There’s a good opportunity, one sees. But, mark me, it will all end in\r\nsatire upon poor Old England. According to Colney, we excel in nothing.’\r\n\r\n‘I do not think there is a country that could offer the entertainment\r\nfor which I am indebted to you to-day.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, my friend, and you like their voices? The contralto?’\r\n\r\n‘Exquisite.’\r\n\r\nDr. Themison had not spoken the name of Radnor.\r\n\r\n‘Shall we see you at our next Concert-evening in town?’ said Victor;\r\nand hearing ‘the privilege’ mentioned, his sharp bright gaze cleared to\r\nlimpid. ‘You have seen how it stands with us here!’ At once he related\r\nwhat indeed Dr. Themison had begun speculatively to think might be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman Radnor had dropped words touching a husband, and of her\r\ndesire to communicate with him, in the event of her being given over to\r\nthe surgeons: she had said, that her husband was a greatly gifted\r\nman; setting her head in a compassionate swing. This revelation of the\r\nhusband soon after, was filling. And this Mr. Radnor’s comrade’s manner\r\nof it, was winning: a not too self-justifying tone; not void of feeling\r\nfor the elder woman; with a manly eulogy of the younger, who had flung\r\naway the world for him and borne him their one dear child. Victor took\r\nthe blame wholly upon himself. ‘It is right that you should know,’ he\r\nsaid to the doctor’s thoughtful posture; and he stressed the blame;\r\nand a flame shot across his eyeballs. He brought home to his hearer the\r\nhurricane of a man he was in the passion: indicating the subjection\r\nof such a temperament as this Victor Radnor’s to trials of the moral\r\nrestraints beyond his human power.\r\n\r\nDr. Themison said: ‘Would you--we postpone that as long as we can: but\r\nsupposing the poor lady...?’\r\n\r\nVictor broke in: ‘I see her wish: I will.’\r\n\r\nThe clash of his answer rang beside Dr. Themison’s faltering query.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful when spared the conclusion of a sentence born to\r\nstammer. If for that only, the doctor pressed Victor’s hand warmly.\r\n\r\n‘I may, then, convey some form of assurance, that a request of the kind\r\nwill be granted?’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘She has but to call me to her,’ said Victor, stiffening his back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. THE GREAT ASSEMBLY AT LAKELANDS\r\n\r\nRound the neighbourhood of Lakelands it was known that the day of the\r\ngreat gathering there had been authoritatively foretold as fine, by\r\nMr. Victor Radnor; and he delivered his prophecy in the teeth of\r\nthe South-western gale familiar to our yachting month; and he really\r\ninspired belief or a kind of trust; some supposing him to draw from\r\nreserves of observation, some choosing to confide in the singularly\r\nwinged sparkle of his eyes. Lady Rodwell Blachington did; and young Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy; and Mrs. Fanning; they were enamoured of it. And when women\r\nstand for Hope, and any worshipped man for Promise, nothing less than\r\nredoubled confusion of him dissolves the union. Even then they cling to\r\nit, under an ejaculation, that it might and should have been otherwise;\r\nfancy partly has it otherwise, in her caerulean home above the weeping.\r\nSo it is good at all points to prophecy with the aspect of the radiant\r\nday foretold.\r\n\r\nA storm, bearing battle overhead, tore the night to pieces. Nataly’s\r\nfaith in the pleasant prognostic wavered beneath the crashes. She had\r\nnot much power of heart to desire anything save that which her bosom\r\ndisavowed. Uproar rather appeased her, calmness agitated. She wished\r\nher beloved to be spared from a disappointment, thinking he deserved all\r\nsuccesses, because of the rigours inflicted by her present tonelessness\r\nof blood and being. Her unresponsive manner with him was not due to lack\r\nof fire in the blood or a loss of tenderness. The tender feeling, under\r\nprivations unwillingly imposed, though willingly shared, now suffused\r\nher reflections, owing to a gratitude induced by a novel experience of\r\nhim; known, as it may chance, and as it does not always chance, to both\r\nsexes in wedded intimacy here and there; known to women whose mates are\r\nproved quick to compliance with delicate intuitions of their moods of\r\nnature. A constant, almost visible, image of the dark thing she desired,\r\nand was bound not to desire, and was remorseful for desiring, oppressed\r\nher; a perpetual consequent warfare of her spirit and the nature subject\r\nto the thousand sensational hypocrisies invoked for concealment of its\r\nreviled brutish baseness, held the woman suspended from her emotions.\r\nShe coldly felt that a caress would have melted her, would have been\r\nthe temporary rapture. Coldly she had the knowledge that the considerate\r\nwithholding of it helped her spirit to escape a stain. Less coldly, she\r\nthanked at heart her beloved, for being a gentleman in their yoke. It\r\nplighted them over flesh.\r\n\r\nHe talked to her on the pillow, just a few sentences; and, unlike\r\nhimself, a word of City affairs: ‘That fellow Blathenoy, with his\r\nincreasing multitude of bills at the Bank: must watch him there, sit\r\nthere regularly. One rather likes his wife. By the way, if you see him\r\nnear me to-morrow, praise the Spanish climate; don’t forget. He heads\r\nthe subscription list of Lady Blachington’s Charity.’\r\n\r\nVictor chuckled at Colney’s humping of shoulders and mouth, while\r\nthe tempest seemed echoing a sulphurous pessimist. ‘If old Colney had\r\nlistened to me, when India gave proof of the metal and South Africa\r\nbegan heaving, he’d have been a fairly wealthy man by now... ha! it\r\nwould have genialized him. A man may be a curmudgeon with money: the\r\nrule is for him to cuddle himself and take a side, instead of dashing at\r\nhis countrymen all round and getting hated. Well, Colney popular, can’t\r\nbe imagined; but entertaining guests would have diluted his acid. He\r\nhas the six hundred or so a year he started old bachelor on; add his\r\nmiserable pay for Essays. Literature! Of course, he sours. But don’t\r\nlet me hear of bachelors moralists. There he sits at his Temple Chambers\r\nhatching epigrams... pretends to have the office of critic! Honest old\r\nfellow, as far as his condition permits. I tell him it will be fine\r\nto-morrow.’\r\n\r\n‘You are generally right, dear,’ Nataly said.\r\n\r\nHer dropping breath was audible.\r\n\r\nVictor smartly commended her to slumber, with heaven’s blessing on her\r\nand a dose of soft nursery prattle.\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hand. He kissed her lips by day. She heard him sigh\r\nsettling himself into the breast of night for milk of sleep, like one of\r\nthe world’s good children. She could have turned to him, to show him she\r\nwas in harmony with the holy night and loving world, but for the fear\r\nfounded on a knowledge of the man he was; it held her frozen to the\r\nsemblance of a tombstone lady beside her lord, in the aisle where horror\r\nkindles pitchy blackness with its legions at one movement. Verily it was\r\nthe ghost of Mrs. Burman come to the bed, between them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun of Victor Radnor’s popularity was already up over the\r\nextended circle likely to be drenched by a falsification of his daring\r\naugury, though the scud flew swift, and the beeches raved, and the oaks\r\nroared and snarled, and pine-trees fell their lengths. Fine tomorrow, to\r\na certainty! he had been heard to say. The doubt weighed for something;\r\nthe balance inclined with the gentleman who had become so popular: for\r\nhe had done the trick so suddenly, like a stroke of the wizard; and was\r\na real man, not one of your spangled zodiacs selling for sixpence and\r\nhopping to a lucky hit, laughed at nine times out of ten. The reasoning\r\nwent--and it somewhat affected the mansion as well as the cottage,--that\r\nif he had become popular in this astonishing fashion, after making one\r\nof the biggest fortunes of modern times, he might, he must, have secret\r\ngifts. ‘You can’t foretell weather!’ cried a pothouse sceptic. But the\r\nworkmen at Lakelands declared that he had foretold it. Sceptics among\r\nthe common folk were quaintly silenced by other tales of him, being a\r\nwhiff from the delirium attending any mention of his name.\r\n\r\nHow had he become suddenly so popular as to rouse in the mind of Mr.\r\nCaddis, the sitting Member for the division of the county (said to\r\nhave the seat in his pocket), a particular inquisitiveness to know the\r\nbearing of his politics? Mr. Radnor was rich, true: but these are days\r\nwhen wealthy men, ambitious of notoriety, do not always prove faithful\r\nto their class; some of them are cunning to bid for the suffrages of the\r\nirresponsible, recklessly enfranchised, corruptible masses. Mr. Caddis,\r\nif he had the seat in his pocket, had it from the support of a class\r\ntrusting him to support its interests: he could count on the landowners,\r\non the clergy, on the retired or retiring or comfortably cushioned\r\nmerchants resident about Wrensham, on the many obsequious among\r\nelectoral shopmen; annually he threw open his grounds, and he\r\nsubscribed, patronized, did what was expected; and he was not popular;\r\nhe was unpopular. Why? But why was the sun of this 23rd August, shining\r\nfrom its rise royally upon pacified, enrolled and liveried armies of\r\ncloud, more agreeable to earth’s populations than his pinched appearance\r\nof the poor mopped red nose and melancholic rheumy eyelets on a January\r\nday! Undoubtedly Victor Radnor risked his repute of prophet. Yet his\r\npopularity would have survived the continuance of the storm and deluge.\r\nHe did this:--and the mystery puzzling the suspicious was nothing\r\nwonderful: in addition to a transparent benevolence, he spread a sort of\r\nassurance about him, that he thought the better of the people for their\r\nthinking well of themselves. It came first from the workmen at his\r\nhouse. ‘The right sort, and no humbug: likes you to be men.’ Such a\r\nreport made tropical soil for any new seed.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a postulate, to strengthen all poor commoners, that not even\r\nin comparison with the highest need we be small unless we yield to think\r\nit of ourselves. Do but stretch a hand to the touch of earth in you, and\r\nyou spring upon combative manhood again, from the basis where all are\r\nequal. Humanity’s historians, however, tell us, that the exhilaration\r\nbringing us consciousness of a stature, is gas which too frequently\r\nhas to be administered. Certes the cocks among men do not require the\r\nprocess; they get it off the sight of the sun arising or a simple hen\r\nsubmissive: but we have our hibernating bears among men, our yoked oxen,\r\ncab horses, beaten dogs; we have on large patches of these Islands,\r\na Saxon population, much wanting assistance, if they are not to feel\r\nthemselves beaten, driven, caught by the neck, yoked and heavyheaded.\r\nBlest, then, is he who gives them a sense of the pride of standing on\r\nlegs. Beer, ordinarily their solitary helper beneath the iron canopy\r\nof wealth, is known to them as a bitter usurer; it knocks them flat\r\nin their persons and their fortunes, for the short spell of recreative\r\nexaltation. They send up their rough glory round the name of the\r\ngentleman--a stranger, but their friend: and never is friend to be\r\nthought of as a stranger--who manages to get the holiday for Wrensham\r\nand thereabout, that they may hurl away for one jolly day the old hat of\r\na doddered humbleness, and trip to the strains of the internal music he\r\nhas unwound.\r\n\r\nSays he: Is it a Charity Concert? Charity begins at home, says he: and\r\nif I welcome you gentry on behalf of the poor of London, why, it follows\r\nyou grant me the right to make a beginning with the poor of our parts\r\ndown here. He puts it so, no master nor mistress neither could refuse\r\nhim. Why, the workmen at his house were nigh pitching the contractors\r\nall sprawling on a strike, and Mr. Radnor takes train, harangues ‘em and\r\nrubs ‘em smooth; ten minutes by the clock, they say; and return train to\r\nhis business in town; by reason of good sense and feeling, it was; poor\r\nmen don’t ask for more. A working man, all the world over, asks but\r\njustice and a little relaxation--just a collar of fat to his lean.\r\n\r\nMr. Caddis, M.P., pursuing the riddle of popularity, which irritated and\r\nrepelled as constantly as it attracted him, would have come nearer to an\r\ninstructive presentment of it, by listening to these plain fellows, than\r\nhe was in the line of equipages, at a later hour of the day. The remarks\r\nof the comfortably cushioned and wheeled, though they be eulogistic\r\nto extravagance, are vapourish when we court them for nourishment;\r\nsubstantially, they are bones to the cynical. He heard enumerations\r\nof Mr. Radnor’s riches, eclipsing his own past compute. A merchant, a\r\nholder of mines, Director of a mighty Bank, projector of running rails,\r\na princely millionaire, and determined to be popular--what was the aim\r\nof the man? It is the curse of modern times, that we never can be sure\r\nof our Parliamentary seat; not when we have it in our pockets! The\r\nRomans have left us golden words with regard to the fickleness of the\r\npopulace; we have our Horace, our Juvenal, we have our Johnson; and in\r\nthis vaunted age of reason it is, that we surrender ourselves into the\r\nhands of the populace! Panem et circenses! Mr. Caddis repeated it, after\r\nhis fathers; his fathers and he had not headed them out of that original\r\nvoracity. There they were, for moneyed legislators to bewail their\r\nappetites. And it was an article of his legislation, to keep them there.\r\n\r\nPedestrian purchasers of tickets for the Charity Concert, rather openly,\r\nin an envelope of humour, confessed to the bait of the Radnor bread with\r\nbit of fun. Savoury rumours were sweeping across Wrensham. Mr. Radnor\r\nhad borrowed footmen of the principal houses about. Cartloads of\r\nprovisions had been seen to come. An immediate reward of a deed of\r\nbenevolence, is a thing sensibly heavenly; and the five-shilling tickets\r\nwere paid for as if for a packet on the counter. Unacquainted with Mr.\r\nRadnor, although the reports of him struck a summons to their gastric\r\njuices, resembling in its effect a clamorous cordiality, they were\r\nchilled, on their steps along the halfrolled new gravel-roads to the\r\nhouse, by seeing three tables of prodigious length, where very evidently\r\na feast had raged: one to plump the people--perhaps excessively courted\r\nby great gentlemen of late; shopkeepers, the villagers, children. These\r\nhad been at it for two merry hours. They had risen. They were beef and\r\npudding on legs; in some quarters, beer amiably manifest, owing to the\r\nflourishes of a military band. Boys, who had shaken room through their\r\nmagical young corporations for fresh stowage, darted out of a chasing\r\ncircle to the crumbled cornucopia regretfully forsaken fifteen minutes\r\nback, and buried another tart. Plenty still reigned: it was the will of\r\nthe Master that it should.\r\n\r\nWe divert our attention, resigned in stoic humour, to the bill of the\r\nConcert music, handed us with our tickets at the park-gates: we have no\r\nright to expect refreshment; we came for the music, to be charitable.\r\nSignora Bianca Luciani: of whom we have read almost to the hearing her;\r\nenough to make the mistake at times. The grand violinist Durandarte:\r\nforcibly detained on his way to America. Mr. Radnor sent him a blank\r\ncheque:--no!--so Mr. Radnor besought him in person: he is irresistible;\r\na great musician himself; it is becoming quite the modern style. We have\r\nnow English noblemen who play the horn, the fife--the drum, some say! We\r\nmay yet be Merrie England again, with our nobles taking the lead.\r\n\r\nEngland’s nobles as a musical band at the head of a marching and dancing\r\npopulation, pictured happily an old Conservative country, that retained\r\nits members of aristocracy in the foremost places while subjecting\r\nthem to downright uses. Their ancestors, beholding them there, would be\r\nsatisfied on the point of honour; perhaps enlivened by hearing them at\r\nfife and drum.\r\n\r\nBut middle-class pedestrians, having paid five shillings for a ticket to\r\nhear the music they love, and not having full assurance of refreshment,\r\nare often, latterly, satirical upon their superiors; and, over this\r\ncountry at least, require the refreshment, that the democratic sprouts\r\nin them may be reconciled with aristocracy. Do not listen to them\r\nfurther on the subject. They vote safely enough when the day comes, if\r\nthere is no praetematurally strong pull the other way.\r\n\r\nThey perceive the name of the Hon. Dudley Sowerby, fourth down the\r\nConcert-bill; marked for a flute-duet with Mr. Victor Radnor, Miss Nesta\r\nVictoria Radnor accompanying at the piano. It may mean?... do you want\r\na whisper to suggest to you what it may mean? The father’s wealth is\r\nenormous; the mother is a beautiful majestic woman in her prime. And\r\nsee, she sings: a wonderful voice. And lower down, a duet with her\r\ndaughter: violins and clarionet; how funny; something Hungarian. And\r\nin the Second Part, Schubert’s Ave Maria--Oh! when we hear that, we\r\ndissolve. She was a singer before he married her, they say: a lady by\r\nbirth one of the first County families. But it was a gift, and she could\r\nnot be kept from it, and was going, when they met--and it was love! the\r\nmost perfect duet. For him she abandoned the Stage. You must remember,\r\nthat in their young days the Stage was many stages beneath the esteem\r\nentertained for it now. Domestic Concerts are got up to gratify her: a\r\nMiss Fredericks: good old English name. Mr. Radnor calls his daughter,\r\nFreddy; so Mr. Taplow, the architect, says. They are for modern music\r\nand ancient. Tannhauser, Wagner, you see. Pergolese.\r\n\r\nFlute-duet, Mercadante. Here we have him! O--Durandarte: Air Basque,\r\nvariations--his own. Again, Senor Durandarte, Mendelssohn. Encore\r\nhim, and he plays you a national piece. A dark little creature a\r\nLife-guardsman could hold-up on his outstretched hand for the fifteen\r\nminutes of the performance; but he fills the hall and thrills the heart,\r\nwafts you to heaven; and does it as though he were conversing with his\r\nAndalusian lady-love in easy whispers about their mutual passion\r\nfor Spanish chocolate all the while: so the musical critic of the\r\nTirra-Lirra says. Express trains every half hour from London; all the\r\nbig people of the city. Mr. Radnor commands them, like Royalty. Totally\r\ndifferent from that old figure of the wealthy City merchant; young,\r\nvigorous, elegant, a man of taste, highest culture, speaks the languages\r\nof Europe, patron of the Arts, a perfect gentleman. His mother was one\r\nof the Montgomerys, Mr. Taplow says.\r\n\r\nAnd it was General Radnor, a most distinguished officer, dying knighted.\r\nBut Mr. Victor Radnor would not take less than a Barony--and then only\r\nwith descent of title to his daughter, in her own right.\r\n\r\nMr. Taplow had said as much as Victor Radnor chose that he should say.\r\n\r\nCarriages were in flow for an hour: pedestrians formed a wavy coil.\r\nJudgeing by numbers, the entertainment was a success; would the hall\r\ncontain them? Marvels were told of the hall. Every ticket entered and\r\nwas enfolded; almost all had a seat. Chivalry stood. It is a breeched\r\nabstraction, sacrificeing voluntarily and genially to the Fair, for a\r\nrestoring of the balance between the sexes, that the division of good\r\nthings be rather in the fair ones’ favour, as they are to think: with\r\nthe warning to them, that the establishment of their claim for equality\r\nputs an end to the priceless privileges of petticoats. Women must be\r\nmad, to provoke such a warning; and the majority of them submissively\r\nshow their good sense. They send up an incense of perfumery, all the\r\nbouquets of the chemist commingled; most nourishing to the idea of\r\nwoman in the nose of man. They are a forest foliage--rustle of silks and\r\nmuslins, magic interweaving, or the mythology, if you prefer it. See,\r\nhear, smell, they are Juno, Venus, Hebe, to you. We must have poetry\r\nwith them; otherwise they are better in the kitchen. Is there--but there\r\nis not; there is not present one of the chivalrous breeched who could\r\nprefer the shocking emancipated gristly female, which imposes propriety\r\non our sensations and inner dreams, by petrifying in the tender bud of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nColonel Corfe is the man to hear on such a theme. He is a colonel of\r\nCompanies. But those are his diversion, as the British Army has been\r\nto the warrior. Puellis idoneus, he is professedly a lady’s man, a\r\nrose-beetle, and a fine specimen of a common kind: and he has been that\r\nthing, that shining delight of the lap of ladies, for a spell of years,\r\nnecessitating a certain sparkle of the saccharine crystals preserving\r\nhim, to conceal the muster. He has to be fascinating, or he would look\r\noutworn, forlorn. On one side of him is Lady Carmine; on the other,\r\nLady Swanage; dames embedded in the blooming maturity of England’s\r\nconservatory. Their lords (an Earl, a Baron) are of the lords who go\r\ndown to the City to sow a title for a repair of their poor incomes, and\r\nare to be commended for frankly accepting the new dispensation while\r\nthey retain the many advantages of the uncancelled ancient. Thus gently\r\ndoes a maternal Old England let them down. Projectors of Companies,\r\nDirectors, Founders; Railway magnates, actual kings and nobles (though\r\none cannot yet persuade old reverence to do homage with the ancestral\r\nspontaneity to the uncrowned, uncoroneted, people of our sphere);\r\nholders of Shares in gold mines, Shares in Afric’s blue mud of the\r\nglittering teeth we draw for English beauty to wear in the ear, on the\r\nneck, at the wrist; Bankers and wives of Bankers. Victor passed among\r\nthem, chatting right and left.\r\n\r\nLady Carmine asked him: ‘Is Durandarte counted on?’\r\n\r\nHe answered: ‘I made sure of the Luciani.’\r\n\r\nShe serenely understood. Artistes are licenced people, with a Bohemian\r\ninstead of the titular glitter for the bewildering of moralists; as\r\npaste will pass for diamonds where the mirror is held up to Nature by\r\nbold supernumeraries.\r\n\r\nHe wished to introduce Nesta. His girl was on the raised orchestral\r\nflooring. Nataly held her fast to a music-scroll.\r\n\r\nMr. Peridon, sad for the absence and cause of absence of Louise de\r\nSeilles,--summoned in the morning abruptly to Bourges, where her brother\r\nlay with his life endangered by an accident at Artillery practise,--Mr.\r\nPeridon was generally conductor. Victor was to lead the full force of\r\namateurs in the brisk overture to Zampa. He perceived a movement of\r\nNataly, Nesta, and Peridon. ‘They have come,’ he said; he jumped on the\r\norchestra boards and hastened to greet the Luciani with Durandarte in\r\nthe retiring-room.\r\n\r\nHis departure raised the whisper that he would wield the baton. An\r\nopinion was unuttered. His name for the flute-duet with the Hon. Dudley\r\nSowerby had not provoked the reserve opinion; it seemed, on the whole,\r\na pretty thing in him to condescend to do: the sentiment he awakened\r\nwas not flustered by it. But the act of leading, appeared as an official\r\nthing to do. Our soufe of sentiment will be seen subsiding under\r\na breath, without a repressive word to send it down. Sir Rodwell\r\nBlachington would have preferred Radnor’s not leading or playing either.\r\nColonel Corfe and Mr. Caddis declined to consider such conduct English,\r\nin a man of station... notwithstanding Royal Highnesses, who are at\r\nleast partly English: partly, we say, under our breath, remembering our\r\nold ideal of an English gentleman, in opposition to German tastes. It is\r\ntrue, that the whole country is changeing, decomposing!\r\n\r\nThe colonel fished for Lady Carmine’s view. And Lady Swanage too? Both\r\nof the distinguished ladies approved of Mr. Radnor’s leading--for a\r\nleading off. Women are pleased to see their favourite in the place of\r\nprominence--as long as Fortune swims him unbuffeted, or one should say,\r\nunbattered, up the mounting wave. Besides these ladies had none of\r\nthe colonel’s remainder of juvenile English sense of the manly, his\r\nadolescent’s intolerance of the eccentric, suspicion and contempt of any\r\nsupposed affectation, which was not ostentatiously, stalkingly practised\r\nto subdue the sex. And you cannot wield a baton without looking\r\naffected. And at one of the Colonel’s Clubs in town, only five years\r\nback, an English musical composer, who had not then made his money--now\r\nby the mystery of events knighted!--had been (he makes now fifteen\r\nthousand a year) black-balled. ‘Fiddler? no; can’t admit a Fiddler to\r\nassociate on equal terms with gentlemen.’ Only five years back: and at\r\npresent we are having the Fiddler everywhere.\r\n\r\nA sprinkling of the minor ladies also would have been glad if Mr. Radnor\r\nhad kept himself somewhat more exclusive. Dr. Schlesien heard remarks,\r\nupon which his weighty Teutonic mind sat crushingly. Do these English\r\ncare one bit for music?--for anything finer than material stuffs?--what\r\nthat man Durance calls, ‘their beef, their beer, and their pew in\r\neternity’? His wrath at their babble and petty brabble doubted that they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBut they do. Art has a hold of them. They pay for it; and the thing\r\npurchased grapples. It will get to their bosoms to breathe from them in\r\ntime: entirely overcoming the taste for feudalism, which still a little\r\nobjects to see their born gentleman acting as leader of musicians. A\r\npeople of slow movement, developing tardily, their country is wanting\r\nin the distincter features, from being always in the transitional state,\r\nlike certain sea-fish rolling head over-you know not head from tail.\r\nWithout the Welsh, Irish, Scot; in their composition, there would not be\r\nmuch of the yeasty ferment: but it should not be forgotten that Welsh,\r\nIrish, Scot, are now largely of their numbers; and the taste for\r\nelegance, and for spiritual utterance, for Song, nay, for Ideas, is\r\nthere among them, though it does not everywhere cover a rocky surface to\r\nbewitch the eyes of aliens;--like Louise de Seilles and Dr. Schlesien,\r\nfor example; aliens having no hostile disposition toward the people they\r\nwere compelled to criticize; honourably granting, that this people has a\r\ngreat history. Even such has the Lion, with Homer for the transcriber of\r\nhis deeds. But the gentle aliens would image our emergence from wildness\r\nas the unsocial spectacle presented by the drear menagerie Lion, alone\r\nor mated; with hardly an animated moment save when the raw red joint is\r\nbeneath his paw, reminding him of the desert’s pasture.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, where Strength is, there is hope:--it may be said more\r\ntruly than of the breath of Life; which is perhaps but the bucket of\r\nbreath, muddy with the sediment of the well: whereas we have in Strength\r\na hero, if a malefactor; whose muscles shall haul him up to the light he\r\nwill prove worthy of, when that divinity has shown him his uncleanness.\r\nAnd when Strength is not exercising, you are sure to see Satirists\r\njump on his back. Dozens, foreign and domestic, are on the back of Old\r\nEngland; a tribute to our quality if at the same time an irritating\r\nscourge. The domestic are in excess; and let us own that their view of\r\nthe potentate, as an apathetic beast of power, who will neither show the\r\npower nor woo the graces; pretending all the while to be eminently above\r\nthe beast, and posturing in an inefficient mimicry of the civilized,\r\nexcites to satire. Colney Durance had his excuses. He could point to the\r\nchief creative minds of the country for generations, as beginning their\r\nsurvey genially, ending venomously, because of an exasperating unreason\r\nand scum in the bubble of the scenes, called social, around them. Viola\r\nunder his chin, he gazed along the crowded hall, which was to him a rich\r\nnational pudding of the sycophants, the hypocrites, the burlies, the\r\nidiots; dregs of the depths and froth of the surface; bowing to one,\r\nthat they may scorn another; instituting a Charity, for their poorer\r\nfawning fellows to relieve their purses and assist them in tricking the\r\nworld and their Maker: and so forth, a tiresome tirade: and as it was\r\nnot on his lips, but in the stomach of the painful creature, let him\r\ngrind that hurdy-gurdy for himself. His friend Victor set it stirring:\r\nVictor had here what he aimed at!\r\n\r\nHow Success derides Ambition! And for this he imperilled the happiness\r\nof the worthy woman he loved! Exposed her to our fen-fogs and foul\r\nsnakes--of whom one or more might be in the assembly now: all because\r\nof his insane itch to be the bobbing cork on the wave of the minute!\r\nColney’s rapid interjections condensed upon the habitual shrug at human\r\nfolly, just when Victor, fronting the glassy stare of Colonel Corfe,\r\ntapped to start his orchestra through the lively first bars of the\r\noverture to Zampa.\r\n\r\nWe soon perceive that the post Mr. Radnor fills he thoroughly fills,\r\nwhatever it may be. Zampa takes horse from the opening. We have no\r\namateur conductor riding ahead: violins, ‘cellos, piano, wind-stops:\r\nPeridon, Catkin, Pempton, Yatt, Cormyn, Colney, Mrs. Cormyn, Dudley\r\nSowerby: they are spirited on, patted, subdued, muted, raised, rushed\r\nanew, away, held in hand, in both hands. Not earnestness worn as a\r\ncloak, but issuing, we see; not simply a leader of musicians, a leader\r\nof men. The halo of the millionaire behind, assures us of a development\r\nin the character of England’s merchant princes. The homage we pay him\r\nflatters us. A delightful overture, masterfully executed; ended too\r\nsoon; except that the programme forbids the ordinary interpretation\r\nof prolonged applause. Mr. Radnor is one of those who do everything\r\nconsummately. And we have a monition within, that a course of spiritual\r\nenjoyment will rouse the call for bodily refreshment. His genial nod and\r\nlaugh and word of commendation to his troop persuade us oddly, we know\r\nnot how, of provision to come. At the door of the retiring-room, see, he\r\nis congratulated by Luciani and Durandarte. Miss Priscilla Graves is\r\nnow to sing a Schumann. Down later, it is a duet with the Rev. Septimus\r\nBarmby. We have nothing to be ashamed of in her, before an Italian\r\nOperatic singer! Ices after the first part is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. DARTREY FENELLAN\r\n\r\nHad Nataly and Nesta known who was outside helping Skepsey to play ball\r\nwith the boys, they would not have worked through their share of the\r\nperformance with so graceful a composure. Even Simeon Fenellan was\r\nunaware that his half-brother Dartrey had landed in England. Dartrey\r\nwent first to Victor’s office, where he found Skepsey packing the\r\nday’s letters and circulars into the bag for the delivery of them\r\nat Lakelands. They sprang a chatter, and they missed the last of the\r\nexpress trains which did, not greatly signify, Skepsey said, ‘as it was\r\na Concert.’ To hear his hero talk, was the music for him; and he richly\r\nenjoyed the pacing along the railway-platform.\r\n\r\nArrived on the grounds, they took opposite sides in a game of rounders,\r\nat that moment tossing heads or tails for innings. These boys were\r\nslovenly players, and were made unhappy by Skepsey’s fussy instructions\r\nto them in smartness. They had a stupid way of feeding the stick, and\r\nthey ran sprawling; it concerned Great Britain for them to learn how to\r\nuse their legs. It was pitiful for the country to see how lumpish her\r\nyounger children were. Dartrey knew his little man and laughed, after\r\nwarning him that his English would want many lessons before they\r\nstomached the mixture of discipline and pleasure. So it appeared: the\r\npride of the boys in themselves, their confidence, enjoyment of the\r\ngame, were all gone; and all were speedily out but Skepsey; who ran for\r\nthe rounder, with his coat off, sharp as a porpoise, and would have got\r\nit, he had it in his grasp, when, at the jump, just over the line of the\r\ngoal, a clever fling, if ever was, caught him a crack on that part of\r\nthe human frame where sound is best achieved. Then were these young\r\nlumps transformed to limber, lither, merry fellows. They rejoiced\r\nSkepsey’s heart; they did everything better, ran and dodged and threw in\r\na style to win the nod from the future official inspector of Games and\r\nAmusements of the common people; a deputy of the Government, proposed by\r\nSkepsey to his hero with a deferential eagerness. Dartrey clapped him on\r\nthe shoulder, softly laughing.\r\n\r\n‘System--Mr. Durance is right--they must have system, if they are to\r\nappreciate a holiday,’ Skepsey said; and he sent a wretched gaze around,\r\nat the justification of some of the lurid views of Mr. Durance, in signs\r\nof the holiday wasted;--impoverishing the country’s manhood in a small\r\ndegree, it may be argued, but we ask, can the country afford it, while\r\nforeign nations are drilling their youth, teaching them to be ready to\r\nmove in squads or masses, like the fist of a pugilist. Skepsey left\r\nit to his look to speak his thought. He saw an enemy in tobacco. The\r\ndrowsiness of beer had stretched various hulks under trees. Ponderous\r\ncricket lumbered half-alive. Flabby fun knocked-up a yell. And it was\r\nrather vexatious to see girls dancing in good time to the band-music.\r\nOne had a male-partner, who hopped his loutish burlesque of the thing he\r\ncould not do.\r\n\r\nApparently, too certainly, none but the girls had a notion of orderly\r\nmuscular exercise. Of what use are girls! Girls have their one mission\r\non earth; and let them be healthy by all means, for the sake of\r\nit; only, they should not seem to prove that old England is better\r\nrepresented on the female side. Skepsey heard, with a nip of spite at\r\nhis bosom, a small body of them singing in chorus as they walked in\r\nstep, arm in arm, actually marched: and to the rearward, none of these\r\ngirls heeding; there were the louts at their burlesque of jigs and\r\nfisticuffs! ‘Cherry Ripe,’ was the song.\r\n\r\n‘It’s delightful to hear them!’ said Dartrey.\r\n\r\nSkepsey muttered jealously of their having been trained.\r\n\r\nThe song, which drew Dartrey Fenellan to the quick of an English home,\r\nplanted him at the same time in Africa to hear it. Dewy on a parched\r\nforehead it fell, England the shedding heaven.\r\n\r\nHe fetched a deep breath, as of gratitude for vital refreshment. He had\r\nhis thoughts upon the training of our English to be something besides\r\nthe machinery of capitalists, and upon the country as a blessed mother\r\ninstead of the most capricious of maudlin step-dames.\r\n\r\nHe flicked his leg with the stick he carried, said: ‘Your master’s the\r\nman to make a change among them, old friend!’ and strolled along to\r\na group surrounding two fellows who shammed a bout at single-stick.\r\nVacuity in the attack on either side, contributed to the joint success\r\nof the defense. They paused under inspection; and Dartrey said: ‘You’re\r\nburning to give them a lesson, Skepsey.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey had no objection to his hero’s doing so, though at his personal\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe sticks were handed to them; the crowd increased; their rounders boys\r\nhad spied them, and came trooping to the scene. Skepsey was directed to\r\nhit in earnest. His defensive attitude flashed, and he was at head and\r\nright and left leg, and giving point, recovering, thrusting madly, and\r\nagain at shoulder and thigh, with bravos for reward of a man meaning\r\nbusiness; until a topper on his hat, a cut over the right thigh, and the\r\nstick in his middlerib, told the spectators of a scientific adversary;\r\nand loudly now the gentleman was cheered. An undercurrent of warm\r\nfeeling ran for the plucky little one at it hot again in spite of the\r\nstrokes, and when he fetched his master a handsome thud across the\r\nshoulder, and the gentleman gave up and complimented him, Skepsey had\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nHe then begged his hero to put the previous couple in position, through\r\na few of the opening movements. They were horribly sheepish at first.\r\nMeantime two boys had got hold of sticks, and both had gone to work in\r\nSkepsey’s gallant style; and soon one was howling. He excused himself,\r\nbecause of the funny-bone, situated, in his case, higher than usual up\r\nthe arm. And now the pair of men were giving and taking cuts to make a\r\nrhinoceros caper.\r\n\r\n‘Very well; begin that way; try what you can bear,’ said Dartrey.\r\n\r\nSkepsey watched them, in felicity for love of the fray, pained by the\r\ndisregard of science.\r\n\r\nComments on the pretty play, indicating a reminiscent acquaintance with\r\nit, and the capacity for critical observations, were started. Assaults,\r\nwonderful tricks of a slashing Life-Guardsman, one spectator had\r\nwitnessed at an exhibition in a London hall. Boxing too. You may see\r\ndisplays of boxing still in places. How about a prizefight?--With money\r\non it?--Eh, but you don’t expect men to stand up to be knocked into\r\nrumpsteaks for nothing?--No, but it’s they there bets!--Right, and\r\nthat’s a game gone to ruin along of outsiders.--But it always was and it\r\nalways will be popular with Englishmen!\r\n\r\nGreat English names of young days, before the wintry shadow of the Law\r\nhad blighted them, received their withered laurels. Emulous boys were in\r\nthe heroic posture. Good! sparring does no hurt: Skepsey seized a likely\r\nlad, Dartrey another. Nature created the Ring for them. Now then, arms\r\nand head well up, chest hearty, shoulders down, out with the right fist,\r\njust below the level of the chin; out with the left fist farther, right\r\nout, except for that bit of curve; so, and draw it slightly back for\r\nwary-pussy at the spring. Firm you stand, feeling the muscles of both\r\nlegs, left half a pace ahead, right planted, both stringy. None of your\r\nmilk-pail looks; show us jaw, you bulldogs. Now then, left from the\r\nshoulder, straight at right of head.--Good, and alacrity called on\r\nvigour in Skepsey’s pupil; Dartrey’s had the fist on his mouth before he\r\ncould parry right arm up. ‘Foul blow!’ Dartrey cried. Skepsey vowed to\r\nthe contrary. Dartrey reiterated his charge. Skepsey was a figure of\r\nnegation, gesticulating and protesting. Dartrey appealed tempestuously\r\nto the Ring; Skepsey likewise, in a tone of injury. He addressed a\r\nremonstrance to Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\n‘Hang your captain, sir! I call you a coward; come on,’ said the\r\nresolute gentleman, already in ripe form for the attack. His blue eyes\r\nwere like the springing sunrise over ridges of the seas; and Skepsey\r\njumped to his meaning.\r\n\r\nBoys and men were spectators of a real scientific set-to, a lovely show.\r\nThey were half puzzled, it seemed so deadly. And the little one got in\r\nhis blows at the gentleman, who had to be hopping. Only, the worse the\r\ngentleman caught it, the friendlier his countenance became. That was the\r\nwonder, and that gave them the key. But it was deliciously near to the\r\nreal thing.\r\n\r\nDartrey and Skepsey shook hands.\r\n\r\n‘And now, you fellows, you’re to know, that this is one of the\r\nchampions; and you take your lesson from him and thank him,’ Dartrey\r\nsaid, as he turned on his heel to strike and greet the flow from the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n‘Dartrey come!’ Victor, Fenellan, Colney, had him by the hand in turn.\r\nPure sweetness of suddenly awakened joy sat in Nataly’s eyes as she swam\r\nto welcome him, Nesta moved a step, seemed hesitating, and she tripped\r\nforward. ‘Dear Captain Dartrey!’\r\n\r\nHe did not say: ‘But what a change in you!’\r\n\r\n‘It is blue-butterfly, all the same,’ Nataly spoke to his look.\r\n\r\nVictor hurriedly pronounced the formal introduction between the Hon.\r\nDudley Sowerby and Captain Dartrey Fenellan. The bronze face and the\r\nmilky bowed to one another ceremoniously; the latter faintly flushing.\r\n\r\n‘So here you are at last,’ Victor said. ‘You stay with us.’\r\n\r\n‘To-morrow or later, if you’ll have me. I go down to my people\r\nto-night.’\r\n\r\n‘But you stay in England now?’ Nataly’s voice wavered on the question.\r\n\r\n‘There’s a chance of my being off to Upper Burmah before the week’s\r\nended.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, dear, dear!’ sighed Fenellan; ‘and out of good comes evil!--as\r\ngrandfather Deucalion exclaimed, when he gallantly handed up his\r\ndripping wife from the mud of the Deluge waters. Do you mean to be\r\nrunning and Dewing it on for ever, with only a nod for friends, Dart?’\r\n\r\n‘Lord, Simmy, what a sound of home there is in your old nonsense!’\r\nDartrey said.\r\n\r\nHis eyes of strong dark blue colour and the foreign swarthiness of his\r\nbrows and cheeks and neck mixed the familiar and the strange, in the\r\nsight of the women who knew him.\r\n\r\nThe bill-broker’s fair-tressed young wife whispered of curiosity\r\nconcerning him to Nataly. He dressed like a sailor, he stood like a\r\nsoldier: and was he married? Yes, he was married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy imagined a something in Mrs. Radnor’s tone. She could\r\naccount for it; not by the ordinary reading of the feminine in the\r\nfeminine, but through a husband who professed to know secrets. She\r\nwas young in years and experience, ten months wedded, disappointedly\r\nawakened, enlivened by the hour, kindled by a novel figure of man,\r\nfretful for a dash of imprudence. This Mrs. Radnor should be the one to\r\nsecond her very innocent turn for a galopade; her own position allowed\r\nof any little diverting jig or reel, or plunge in a bath--she required\r\nit, for the domestic Jacob Blathenoy was a dry chip: proved such,\r\nwithout a day’s variation during the whole of the ten wedded months.\r\nNataly gratified her spoken wish. Dartrey Fenellan bowed to the lady,\r\nand she withdrew him, seeing composedly that other and greater ladies\r\nhad the wish ungratified. Their husbands were not so rich as hers, and\r\ntheir complexions would hardly have pleased the handsome brown-faced\r\nofficer so well.\r\n\r\nBanquet, equal to a blast of trumpet, was the detaining word for the\r\nmultitude. It circulated, one knows not how. Eloquent as the whiffs to\r\nthe sniffs (and nowhere is eloquence to match it, when the latter are\r\nsharpened from within to without), the word was very soon over the\r\nfield. Mr. Carling may have helped; he had it from Fenellan; and he\r\nwas among the principal groups, claiming or making acquaintances, as a\r\nlawyer should do. The Concert was complimentarily a topic: Durandarte\r\ndivine!--did not everybody think so? Everybody did, in default of a term\r\nfor overtopping it. Our language is poor at hyperbole; our voices\r\nare stronger. Gestures and heaven-sent eyeballs invoke to display the\r\nineffable. Where was Durandarte now? Gone; already gone; off with the\r\nLuciani for evening engagements; he came simply to oblige his dear\r\nfriend Mr. Radnor. Cheque fifty guineas: hardly more on both sides than\r\nan exchange of smiles. Ah, these merchant-princes! What of Mr. Radnor’s\r\namateur instrumentalists? Amateurs, they are not to be named: perfect\r\nmusicians. Mr. Radnor is the perfection of a host. Yes, yes; Mrs.\r\nRadnor; Miss Radnor too: delicious voices; but what is it about Mr.\r\nRadnor so captivating! He is not quite English, yet he is not at all\r\nforeign. Is he very adventurous in business, as they say?\r\n\r\n‘Soundest head in the City of London,’ Mr. Blathenoy remarked.\r\n\r\nSir Rodwell Blachington gave his nod.\r\n\r\nThe crowd interjected, half-sighing. We ought to be proud of such a man!\r\nPerhaps we are a trifle exaggerating, says its heart. But that we are\r\nwholly grateful to him, is a distinct conclusion. And he may be one of\r\nthe great men of his time: he has a quite individual style of dress.\r\n\r\nLady Rodwell Blachington observed to Colney Durance:\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Radnor bids fair to become the idol of the English people.’\r\n\r\n‘If he can prove himself to be sufficiently the dupe of the English\r\npeople,’ said Colney.\r\n\r\n‘Idol--dupe?’ interjected Sir Rodwell, and his eyebrows fixed at the\r\nperch of Colney’s famous ‘national interrogation’ over vacancy of\r\nunderstanding, as if from the pull of a string. He had his audience with\r\nhim; and the satirist had nothing but his inner gush of acids at sight\r\nof a planted barb.\r\n\r\nColney was asked to explain. He never explained. He performed a series\r\nof astonishing leaps, like the branchy baboon above the traveller’s head\r\nin the tropical forest, and led them into the trap they assisted him to\r\nprepare for them. ‘No humour, do you say? The English have no humour?’ a\r\nnephew of Lady Blachington’s inquired of him, with polite pugnacity, and\r\nwas cordially assured, that ‘he vindicated them.’\r\n\r\n‘And Altruistic! another specimen of the modern coinage,’ a classical\r\nChurch dignitary, in grammarian disgust, remarked to a lady, as they\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nColney pricked-up his ears. It struck him that he might fish for\r\nsuggestions in aid of the Grand Argument before the Elders of the Court\r\nof Japan. Dr. Wardan, whose recognition he could claim, stated to him,\r\nthat the lady and he were enumerating words of a doubtfully legitimate\r\nquality now being inflicted upon the language.\r\n\r\n‘The slang from below is perhaps preferable?’ said Colney.\r\n\r\n‘As little-less.’\r\n\r\n‘But a pirate-tongue, cut-off from its roots, must continue to practise\r\npiracy, surely, or else take reinforcements in slang, otherwise it is\r\ninexpressive of new ideas.’\r\n\r\n‘Possibly the new ideas are best expressed in slang.’\r\n\r\n‘If insular. They will consequently be incommunicable to foreigners.\r\nYou would, then, have us be trading with tokens instead of a precious\r\ncurrency? Yet I cannot perceive the advantage of letting our ideas be\r\nclothed so racy of the obscener soil; considering the pretensions of the\r\nEnglish language to become the universal. If we refuse additions from\r\nabove, they force themselves on us from below.’\r\n\r\nDr. Wardan liked the frame of the observations, disliked the substance.\r\n\r\n‘One is to understand that the English language has these pretensions?’\r\nhe said:--he minced in his manner, after the well-known mortar-board\r\nand tassel type; the mouthing of a petrifaction: clearly useless to the\r\npleadings of the patriotic Dr. Bouthoin and his curate.\r\n\r\nHe gave no grip to Colney, who groaned at cheap Donnish sarcasm, and let\r\nhim go, after dealing him a hard pellet or two in a cracker-covering.\r\n\r\nThere was Victor all over the field netting his ephemerae! And he who\r\nfeeds on them, to pay a price for their congratulations and flatteries,\r\nhe is one of them himself!\r\n\r\nNesta came tripping from the Rev. Septimus Barmby. ‘Dear Mr. Durance,\r\nwhere is Captain Dartrey?’\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy had just conducted her husband through a crowd, for an\r\nintroduction of him to Captain Dartrey. That was perceptible.\r\n\r\nDudley Sowerby followed Nesta closely: he struck across the path of the\r\nRev. Septimus: again he had the hollow of her ear at his disposal.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Radnor was excellent. He does everything consummately: really, we\r\nare all sensible of it. I am. He must lead us in a symphony. These light\r\n“champagne overtures” of French composers, as Mr. Fenellan calls\r\nthem, do not bring out his whole ability:--Zampa, Le Pre aux clercs,\r\nMasaniello, and the like.’\r\n\r\n‘Your duet together went well.’\r\n\r\n‘Thanks to you--to you. You kept us together.’\r\n\r\n‘Papa was the runaway or strain-the-leash, if there was one.’\r\n\r\n‘He is impetuous, he is so fervent. But, Miss Radnor, I could not be the\r\nrunaway-with you... with you at the piano. Indeed, I... shall we stroll\r\ndown? I love the lake.’\r\n\r\n‘You will hear the bell for your cold dinner very soon.’\r\n\r\n‘I am not hungry. I would so much rather talk--hear you. But you are\r\nhungry? You have been singing twice: three times! Opera singers, they\r\nsay, eat hot suppers; they drink stout. And I never heard your voice\r\nmore effective. Yours is a voice that... something of the feeling one\r\nhas in hearing cathedral voices: carry one up. I remember, in Dresden,\r\nonce, a Fraulein Kuhnstreich, a prodigy, very young, considering her\r\naccomplishments. But it was not the same.’\r\n\r\nNesta wondered at Dartrey Fenellan for staying so long with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, Mr. Sowerby, if I am to have flattery, I cannot take it as a\r\nmilliner’s dumb figure wears the beautiful dress; I must point out my\r\nview of some of my merits.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! do, I beg, Miss... You have a Christian name and I too: and once\r\n... not Mr. Sowerby: yes, it was Dudley!\r\n\r\n‘Quite accidentally, and a world of pardons entreated.’\r\n\r\n‘And Dudley begged Dudley might be Dudley always!’\r\n\r\nHe was deepening to the Barmby intonation--apparently Cupid’s; but a\r\nshade more airily Pagan, not so fearfully clerical.\r\n\r\nHer father had withdrawn Dartrey Fenellan from Mr. and Mrs. Blathenoy.\r\nDr. Schlesien was bowing with Dartrey.\r\n\r\n‘And if Durandarte would only--but you are one with Miss Graves to\r\ndepreciate my Durandarte, in favour of the more classical Jachimo; whom\r\nwe all admire; but you shall be just,’ said she, and she pouted. She had\r\nseen her father plant Dartrey Fenellan in the midst of a group of City\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nSimeon touched among them to pluck at his brother. He had not a chance;\r\nhe retired, and swam into the salmon-net of seductive Mrs. Blathenoy’s\r\nbroad bright smile.\r\n\r\n‘It’s a matter of mines, and they’re hovering in the attitude of\r\nthe query, like corkscrews over a bottle, profoundly indifferent to\r\nblood-relationships,’ he said to her.\r\n\r\n‘Pray, stay and be consoled by me,’ said the fair young woman. ‘You\r\nare to point me out all the distinguished people. Is it true, that your\r\nbrother has left the army?’\r\n\r\n‘Dartrey no longer wears the red. Here comes Colonel Corfe, who does.\r\nEngland has her army still!’\r\n\r\n‘His wife persuaded him?’\r\n\r\n‘You see he is wearing the black.’\r\n\r\n‘For her? How very very sad! Tell me--what a funnily dressed woman\r\nmeeting that gentleman!’\r\n\r\n‘Hush--a friend of the warrior. Splendid weather, Colonel Corfe.’\r\n\r\n‘Superb toilettes!’ The colonel eyed Mrs. Blathenoy dilatingly,\r\nadvanced, bowed, and opened the siege.\r\n\r\nShe decided a calculation upon his age, made a wall of it, smilingly\r\nagreed with his encomium of the Concert, and toned her voice to\r\nFenellan’s comprehension: ‘Did it occur recently?’\r\n\r\n‘Months; in Africa; I haven’t the date.’\r\n\r\n‘Such numbers of people one would wish to know! Who are those ladies\r\nholding a Court, where Mr. Radnor is?’\r\n\r\n‘Lady Carmine, Lady Swanage--if it is your wish?’ interposed the\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\nShe dealt him a forgiving smile. ‘And that pleasant-looking old\r\ngentleman?’\r\n\r\nColonel Corfe drew-up. Fenellan said: ‘Are we veterans at forty or so?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, it ‘s the romance, perhaps!’ She raised her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe colonel’s intelligence ran a dog’s nose for a lady’s interjections.\r\n‘The romance?... at forty, fifty? gone? Miss Julinks, the great heiress\r\nand a beauty; has chosen him over the heads of all the young men of his\r\ntime. Cranmer Lotsdale. Most romantic history!’\r\n\r\n‘She’s in love with that, I suppose.’\r\n\r\n‘Now you direct my attention to him,’ said Fenellan, ‘the writing of the\r\nromantic history has made the texture look a trifle thready. You have a\r\nterrible eye.’\r\n\r\nIt was thrown to where the person stood who had first within a few\r\nminutes helped her to form critical estimates of men, more consciously\r\nto read them.\r\n\r\n‘Your brother stays in England?’\r\n\r\n‘The fear is, that he’s off again.’\r\n\r\n‘Annoying for you. If I had a brother, I would not let him go.’\r\n\r\n‘How would you detain him?’\r\n\r\n‘Locks and bolts, clock wrong, hands and arms, kneeling--the fourth act\r\nof the Huguenots!’\r\n\r\n‘He went by way of the window, I think. But that was a lover.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! well!’ she flushed. She did not hear the ‘neglected and astonished\r\ncolonel speak, and she sought diversion in saying to Fenellan: ‘So many\r\npeople of distinction are assembled here to-day! Tell me, who is that\r\npompous gentleman, who holds his arms up doubled, as he walks?’\r\n\r\n‘Like flappers of a penguin: and advances in jerks: he is head of the\r\ngreat Firm of Quatley Brothers: Sir Abraham: finances or farms one of\r\nthe South American Republics: we call him, Pride of Port. He consumes it\r\nand he presents it.’\r\n\r\n‘And who is that little man, who stops everybody?’\r\n\r\n‘People of distinction indeed! That little man--is your upper lip\r\nunderrateing him?... When a lady’s lip is erratically disdainful,\r\nit suggests a misuse of a copious treasury, deserving to be mulcted,\r\npunished--how?--who can say?--that little man, now that little man, with\r\na lift of his little finger, could convulse the Bacon Market!’\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy shook. Hearing Colonel Corfe exclaim:\r\n\r\n‘Bacon Market!’ she let fly a peal. Then she turned to a fresh\r\nsatellite, a round and a ruddy, ‘at her service ever,’ Mr. Beaves\r\nUrmsing, and repeated Fenellan’s words. He, in unfeigned wonderment at\r\nsuch unsuspected powers, cried: ‘Dear me!’ and stared at the little man,\r\nmaking the pretty lady’s face a twinkling dew.\r\n\r\nHe had missed the Concert. Was it first-rate? Ecstasy answered in the\r\nfemale voice.\r\n\r\n‘Hem’d fool I am to keep appointments!’ he muttered.\r\n\r\nShe reproved him: ‘Fie, Mr. Urmsing; it’s the making of them, not the\r\nkeeping!’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, my dear ma’am, if I’d had Blathenoy’s luck when he made a certain\r\nappointment. And he was not so much older than me? The old ones get the\r\nprizes!’\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing prompted Colonel Corfe to laugh in triumph. The\r\ncolonel’s eyebrows were up in fixity over sleepy lids. He brightened to\r\npropose the conducting of the pretty woman to the banquet.\r\n\r\n‘We shall see them going in,’ said she. ‘Mr. Radnor has a French cook,\r\nwho does wonders. But I heard him asking for Mr. Beaves Urmsing. I’m\r\nsure he expected The Marigolds at his Concert.’\r\n\r\n‘Anything to oblige the company,’ said the rustic ready chorister,\r\nclearing his throat.\r\n\r\nThe lady’s feet were bent in the direction of a grassy knoll, where\r\nsunflowers, tulips, dahlias, peonies, of the sex eclipsed at a distance\r\nits roses and lilies. Fenellan saw Dartrey, still a centre of the\r\nmerchantmen, strolling thither.\r\n\r\n‘And do you know, your brother is good enough to dine with us next week,\r\nThursday, down here,’ she murmured. ‘I could venture to command?--if you\r\nare not induced.’\r\n\r\n‘Whichever word applies to a faithful subject.’\r\n\r\n‘I do so wish your brother had not left the army!’\r\n\r\n‘You have one son of Mars.’\r\n\r\nHer eyes took the colonel up to cast him down: he was not the antidote.\r\nShe said to him: ‘Luciani’s voice wears better than her figure.’\r\n\r\nThe colonel replied: ‘I remember,’ and corrected himself, ‘at Eton, in\r\njackets: she was not so particularly slim; never knew how to dress. You\r\nbeat Italians there! She moved one as a youngster.’\r\n\r\n‘Eton boys are so susceptible!’\r\n\r\n‘Why, hulloa, don’t I remember her coming out!--and do you mean to tell\r\nme,’ Mr. Beaves Urmsing brutally addressed the colonel, ‘that you were\r\nat Eton when... why, what age do you give the poor woman, then!’ He\r\nbellowed, ‘Eh?’ as it were a bull crowing.\r\n\r\nThe colonel retreated to one of his defensive corners. ‘I am not aware\r\nthat I meant to tell you anything.’\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing turned square-breasted on Fenellan: ‘Fellow’s a born\r\ndonkey!’\r\n\r\n‘And the mother lived?’ said Fenellan.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing puffed with wrath at the fellow.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, in the midst of the group surrounding and\r\nfelicitating Victor, he had sight of Fenellan conversing with fair ones,\r\nand it struck a light in him; he went three steps backward, with shouts.\r\n‘Dam funny fellow! eh? who is he? I must have that man at my table.\r\nWorth fifty Colonel Jackasses! And I ‘ve got a son in the Guards: and as\r\nmuch laugh in him, he ‘s got, as a bladder. But we’ll make a party, eh,\r\nRadnor? with that friend o’ yours. Dam funny fellow! and precious little\r\nof it going on now among the young lot. They’re for seeing ghosts and\r\ngaping their jaws; all for the quavers instead of the capers.’\r\n\r\nHe sounded and thrummed his roguish fling-off for the capers. A second\r\nglimpse of Fenellan agitated the anecdote, as he called it, seizing\r\nVictor’s arm, to have him out of earshot of the ladies. Delivery,\r\nnot without its throes, was accomplished, but imperfectly, owing to\r\nsympathetic convulsions, under which Mr. Beaves Urmsing’s countenance\r\nwas crinkled of many colours, as we see the Spring rhubarb-leaf. Unable\r\nto repeat the brevity of Fenellan’s rejoinder, he expatiated on it to\r\nconvey it, swearing that it was the kind of thing done in the old days,\r\nwhen men were witty dogs:--‘pat! and pat back! as in the pantomime.’\r\n\r\n‘Repartee!’ said Victor. ‘He has it. You shall know him. You’re the man\r\nfor him.’\r\n\r\n‘He for me, that he is!--“Hope the mother’s doing well? My card”:--eh?\r\nGrave as an owl! Look, there goes the donkey, lady to right and left,\r\nall ears for him--ha! ha! I must have another turn with your friend.\r\n“Mother lived, did she?” Dam funny fellow, all of the olden time! And\r\na dinner, bachelor dinner, six of us, at my place, next week, say\r\nWednesday, half-past six, for a long evening--flowing bowl--eh, shall it\r\nbe?’\r\n\r\nNesta came looking to find her Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\nMr. Beaves Urmsing grew courtly of the olden time. He spied Colonel\r\nCorfe anew, and ‘Donkey!’ rose to split the roar at his mouth, and full\r\nof his anecdote, he pursued some congenial acquaintances, crying to his\r\nhost: ‘Wednesday, mind! eh? by George, your friend’s gizzarded me for\r\nthe day!’\r\n\r\nPlumped with the rich red stream of life, this last of the squires of\r\nold England thumped along among the guests, a very tuning-fork to keep\r\nthem at their pitch of enthusiasm. He encountered Mr. Caddis, and it was\r\nan encounter. Mr. Caddis represented his political opinions; but here\r\nwas this cur of a Caddis whineing his niminy note from his piminy nob,\r\nwhen he was asked for his hearty echo of the praises of this jolly good\r\nfellow come to waken the neighbourhood, to be a blessing, a blazing\r\nhearth, a fall of manna:--and thank the Lord for him, you desertdog! ‘He\r\n‘s a merchant prince, and he’s a prince of a man, if you’re for titles.\r\nEh? you “assent to my encomiums.” You’ll be calling me Mr. Speaker next.\r\nHang me, Caddis, if those Parliamentary benches of yours aren’t freezing\r\nyou from your seat up, and have got to your jaw--my belief!’\r\n\r\nMr. Caddis was left reflecting, that we have, in the dispensations\r\nof Providence, when we have a seat, to submit to castigations from\r\nbutcherly men unaccountably commissioned to solidify the seat. He could\r\nhave preached a discourse upon Success, to quiet the discontentment of\r\nthe unseated. And our world of seats oddly gained, quaintly occupied,\r\nmaliciously beset, insensately envied, needs the discourse. But it was\r\nnot delivered, else would it have been here written down without mercy,\r\nas a medical prescript, one of the grand specifics. He met Victor,\r\nand, between his dread of him and the counsels of a position subject\r\nto stripes, he was a genial thaw. Victor beamed; for Mr. Caddis had\r\npreviously stood eminent as an iceberg of the Lakelands’ party. Mr.\r\nInchling and Mr. Caddis were introduced. The former in Commerce, the\r\nlatter in Politics, their sustaining boast was, the being our stable\r\nEnglishmen; and at once, with cousinly minds, they fell to chatting upon\r\nthe nothings agreeably and seriously. Colney Durance forsook a set of\r\nladies for fatter prey, and listened to them. What he said, Victor did\r\nnot hear. The effect was always to be seen, with Inchling under Colney.\r\nFenellan did better service, really good service.\r\n\r\nNataly played the heroine she was at heart. Why think of her as having\r\nto act a character! Twice had Carling that afternoon, indirectly and\r\ndirectly, stated Mrs. Burman to be near the end we crape a natural, a\r\ndefensible, satisfaction to hear of:--not wishing it--poor woman!--but\r\npardonably, before man and all the angels, wishing, praying for the\r\nbeloved one to enter into her earthly peace by the agency of the other’s\r\nexit into her heavenly.\r\n\r\nFenellan and Colney came together, and said a word apiece of their\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n‘In his element! The dear old boy has the look of a goldfish, king of\r\nhis globe.’\r\n\r\n‘The dear old boy has to me the look of a pot on the fire, with a loose\r\nlid.’\r\n\r\nI may have the summons from Themison to-morrow, Victor thought. The\r\nsuccess of the day, was a wine that rocked the soberest of thoughts.\r\nFor, strange to confess, ever since the fall on London Bridge, his\r\nheart, influenced in some degree by Nataly’s depression perhaps, had\r\nbeen shadowed by doubts of his infallible instinct for success. Here, at\r\na stroke, and before entering the house, he had the whole neighbourhood\r\nabout him: he could feel that he and Nataly stood in the minds of the\r\nworthy people variously with the brightness if not with the warmth\r\ndistinguishable in the bosom of Beaves Urmsing--the idea of whom gave\r\nLakelands an immediate hearth-glow.\r\n\r\nArmandine was thirteen minutes, by his watch, behind the time she had\r\nnamed. Small blame to her. He excused her to Lady Carmine, Lady Swanage,\r\nLady Blachington, Mrs. Fanning, Sir Abraham Quatley, Mr. Danny (of Bacon\r\nfame) and the rest of the group surrounding Nataly on the mound leftward\r\nof the white terraces descending to the lake; where she stood beating\r\nher foot fretfully at the word brought by Nesta, that Dartrey Fenellan\r\nhad departed. It was her sunshine departed. But she went through her\r\ntask of conversing amiably. Colney, for a wonder, consented to be useful\r\nin assisting Fenellan to relate stories of French Cooks; which were,\r\nlike the Royal Hanoverian oyster, of an age for offering acceptable\r\nflavour to English hearers. Nesta drew her mother’s attention to\r\nPriscilla Graves and Skepsey; the latter bending head and assenting.\r\nNataly spoke of the charm of Priscilla’s voice that day, in her duet\r\nwith the Rev. Septimus. Mr. Pempton looked; he saw that Priscilla was\r\nproselytizing. She was perfection to him but for one blotting thing.\r\nWith grief on his eyelids, he said to Nataly or to himself: ‘Meat!’\r\n\r\n‘Dear friend, don’t ride your hobby over us,’ she replied.\r\n\r\n‘But it’s with that object they mount it,’ said Victor.\r\n\r\nThe greater ladies of the assembly were quite ready to accuse the\r\nsections, down to the individuals, of the social English (reserving our\r\nelect) of an itch to be tyrants.\r\n\r\nColney was apologizing for them, with his lash: ‘It’s merely the\r\nsensible effect of a want of polish of the surface when they rub\r\ntogether.’\r\n\r\nAnd he heard Carling exclaim to Victor: ‘How comes the fellow here!’\r\n\r\nSkepsey had rushed across an open space to intercept a leisurely\r\nprogressive man, whose hat was of the shape Victor knew; and the man\r\nwore the known black gaiters. In appearance, he had the likeness of a\r\nfallen parson.\r\n\r\nCarling and Victor crossed looks that were questions carrying their\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nNataly’s eyes followed Victor’s. ‘Who is the man?’ she said; and she got\r\nno reply beyond a perky sparkle in his gaze.\r\n\r\nOthers were noticing the man, who was trying to pass by Skepsey, now on\r\nhis right side, now on his left.\r\n\r\n‘There’ll be no stopping him,’ Carling said, and he slipped to the\r\nrear.’\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Armandine’s mellow bell proclaimed her readiness.\r\n\r\nVictor rubbed the back of his head. Nataly asked him: ‘Dear, is it that\r\nman?’\r\n\r\nHe nodded scantly: ‘Expected, expected. I think we have our summons from\r\nArmandine. One moment--poor soul! poor soul! Lady Carmine--Sir Abraham\r\nQuatley. Will you lead? Lady Blachington, I secure you. One moment.’\r\n\r\nHe directed Nataly to pair a few of the guests; he hurried down the\r\nslope of sward.\r\n\r\nNataly applied to Colney Durance. ‘Do you know the man?--is it that\r\nman?’\r\n\r\nColney rejoined: ‘The man’s name is Jarniman.’\r\n\r\nArmandine’s bell swung melodiously. The guests had grouped, thickening\r\nfor the stream to procession. Mrs. Blathenoy claimed Fenellan; she\r\nrequested him to tell her whether he had known Mrs. Victor Radnor many\r\nyears. She mused. ‘You like her?’\r\n\r\n‘One likes one’s dearest of friends among women, does one not?’\r\n\r\nThe lady nodded to his response. ‘And your brother?’\r\n\r\n‘Dartrey is devoted to her.’\r\n\r\n‘I am sure,’ said she, ‘your brother is a chivalrous gentleman. I\r\nlike her too.’ She came to her sentiment through the sentiment of the\r\nchivalrous gentleman. Sinking from it, she remarked that Mr. Radnor\r\nwas handsome still. Fenellan commended the subject to her, as one to\r\ndiscourse of when she met Dartrey. A smell of a trap-hatch, half-open,\r\nafflicted and sharpened him. It was Blathenoy’s breath: husbands of\r\nyoung wives do these villanies, for the sake of showing their knowledge.\r\nFenellan forbore to praise Mrs. Victor: he laid his colours on Dartrey.\r\nThe lady gave ear till she reddened. He meant no harm, meant nothing but\r\ngood; and he was lighting the most destructive of our lower fires.\r\n\r\nVisibly, that man Jarniman was disposed of with ease. As in the\r\nstreet-theatres of crowing Punch, distance enlisted pantomime to do the\r\neffective part of the speeches. Jarniman’s hat was off, he stood bent,\r\nhe delivered his message. He was handed over to Skepsey’s care for the\r\nreceiving of meat and drink. Victor returned; he had Lady Blachington’s\r\nhand on his arm; he was all hers, and in the heart of his company of\r\nguests at the same time. Eyes that had read him closely for years,\r\nwere unable to spell a definite signification on his face, below the\r\noverflowing happiness of the hospitable man among contented guests. He\r\nhad in fact something within to enliven him; and that was the more than\r\nsuspicion, amounting to an odour of certainty, that Armandine intended\r\none of her grand surprises for her master, and for the hundred and fifty\r\nor so to be seated at her tables in the unwarmed house of Lakelands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. CONCERNS THE INTRUSION OF JARNIMAN\r\n\r\nArmandine did her wonders. There is not in the wide range of the Muses\r\na more responsive instrument than man to his marvellous cook; and if\r\nhis notes were but as flowing as his pedals are zealous, we should be\r\ncarried on the tale of the enthusiasm she awakened, away from the rutted\r\nhighroad, where History now thinks of tightening her girdle for an\r\naccelerated pace.\r\n\r\nThe wonders were done: one hundred and seventy guests plenteously fed\r\nat tables across the great Concert Hall, down a length of the\r\nconservatory-glass, on soups, fish, meats, and the kitchen-garden, under\r\nplay of creative sauces, all in the persuasive steam of savouriness;\r\nevery dish, one may say, advancing, curtseying, swimming to be your\r\npartner, instead of passively submitting to the eye of appetite,\r\nconsenting to the teeth, as that rather melancholy procession of the\r\ncold, resembling established spinsters thrice-corseted in decorum, will\r\nappear to do. Whether Armandine had the thought or that she simply acted\r\nin conformity with a Frenchwoman’s direct good sense, we do require to\r\nsmell a sort of animation in the meats we consume. We are still perhaps\r\ntraceably related to the Adamite old-youngster just on his legs,\r\nwho betrayed at every turn his Darwinian beginnings, and relished\r\na palpitating unwillingness in the thing refreshing him; only we\r\nyoung-oldsters cherish the milder taste for willingness, with a throb of\r\nthe vanquished in it. And a seeming of that we get from the warm roast.\r\nThe banquet to be fervently remembered, should smoke, should send out\r\na breath to meet us. Victor’s crowded saloon-carriage was one voice\r\nof eulogy, to raise Armandine high as the finale rockets bursting\r\nover Wrensham Station at the start Londonward. How had she managed? We\r\nfoolishly question the arts of magicians.\r\n\r\nMr. Pempton was an apparent dissentient, as the man must be who is\r\nhalf a century ahead of his fellows in humaneness, and saddened by the\r\ndisplay of slaughtered herds and their devourers. He had picked out\r\nhis vegetable and farinaceous morsels, wherever he could get them\r\nuncontaminated; enough for sustenance; and the utmost he could show was,\r\nthat he did not complain. When mounted and ridden by the satirist, in\r\nwrath at him for systematically feasting the pride of the martyr on\r\nthe maceration of his animal part, he put on his martyr’s pride, which\r\nassumed a perfect contentment in the critical depreciation of opposing\r\nsystems: he was drawn to state, as he had often done, that he considered\r\nour animal part shamefully and dangerously over nourished, and that\r\nmuch of the immorality of the world was due to the present excessive\r\nindulgence in meats. ‘Not in drink?’ Miss Graves inquired. ‘No,’ he said\r\nboldly; ‘not equally; meats are more insidious. I say nothing of taking\r\nlife--of fattening for that express purpose: diseases of animals: bad\r\nblood made: cruelty superinduced: it will be seen to be, it will be\r\nlooked back on, as a form of, a second stage of, cannibalism. Let that\r\npass. I say, that for excess in drinking, the penalty is paid instantly,\r\nor at least on the morrow.’\r\n\r\n‘Paid by the drunkard’s wife, you should say.’\r\n\r\n‘Whereas intemperance in eating, corrupts constitutionally, more\r\nspiritually vitiates, we think: on the whole, gluttony is the\r\nleast-generous of the vices.’\r\n\r\nColney lured Mr. Pempton through a quagmire of the vices to declare,\r\nthat it brutalized; and stammeringly to adopt the suggestion, that our\r\nbreeding of English ladies--those lights of the civilized world--can\r\nhardly go with a feeding upon flesh of beasts. Priscilla regretted that\r\nchampagne should have to be pleaded in excuse of impertinences to her\r\nsex. They were both combative, nibbed for epigram, edged to inflict\r\nwounds; and they were set to shudder openly at one another’s practises;\r\nthey might have exposed to Colney which of the two maniacal sections of\r\nhis English had the vaster conceit of superiority in purity; they were\r\nbaring themselves, as it were with a garment flung-off at each retort.\r\nHe reproached them for undermineing their countrymen; whose Falstaff\r\npanics demanded blood of animals to restore them; and their periods of\r\nbragging, that they should brandify their wits to imagine themselves\r\nVikings.\r\n\r\nNataly interposed. She was vexed with him. He let his eyelids drop: but\r\nthe occasion for showing the prickliness of the bristly social English,\r\ncould not be resisted. Dr. Peter Yatt was tricked to confess, that small\r\nannoyances were, in his experience, powerful on the human frame; and Dr.\r\nJohn Cormyn was very neatly brought round to assure him he was mistaken\r\nif he supposed the homoeopathic doctor who smoked was exercising a\r\ndestructive influence on the efficacy of the infinitesimal doses\r\nhe prescribed; Dr. Yatt chuckled a laugh at globules; Dr. Cormyn at\r\npatients treated as horses; while Mr. Catkin was brought to praise the\r\nsmoke of tobacco as our sanctuary from the sex; and Mr. Peridon quietly\r\ndenied, that the taking of it into his nostrils from the puffs of his\r\nfriend caused him sad silences: Nesta flew to protect the admirer of\r\nher beloved Louise. Her subsiding young excitement of the day set her\r\nBoating on that moony melancholy in Mr. Peridon.\r\n\r\nNo one could understand the grounds for Colney’s more than usual\r\nwaspishness. He trotted out the fulgent and tonal Church of the Rev.\r\nSeptimus; the skeleton of worship, so truly showing the spirit, in that\r\nof Dudley Sowerby’s family; maliciously admiring both; and he had a spar\r\nwith Fenellan, ending in a snarl and a shout. Victor said to him: ‘Yes,\r\nhere, as much as you like, old Colney, but I tell you, you’ve staggered\r\nthat poor woman Lady Blachington to-day, and her husband too; and I\r\ndon’t know how many besides. What the pleasure of it can be, I can’t\r\nguess.’\r\n\r\n‘Nor I,’ said Fenellan, ‘but I’ll own I feel envious; like the girl\r\namong a family of boys I knew, who were all of them starved in their\r\ninfancy by a miserly father, that gave them barely a bit of Graves to\r\neat and not a drop of Pempton to drink; and on the afternoon of his\r\nfuneral, I found them in the drawing-room, four lank fellows, heels up,\r\nwalking on their hands, from long practice; and the girl informed me,\r\nthat her brothers were able so to send the little blood they had in\r\ntheir bodies to their brains, and always felt quite cheerful for it,\r\nhappy, and empowered to deal with the problems of the universe; as they\r\ncouldn’t on their legs; but she, poor thing, was forbidden to do the\r\nsame! And I’m like her. I care for decorum too much to get the brain\r\nto act on Colney’s behaviour; but I see it enraptures him and may be\r\ncomprehensible to the topsy-turvy.’\r\n\r\nVictor rubbed hands. It was he who filled Colney’s bag of satiric spite.\r\nIn addition to the downright lunacy of the courting of country society,\r\nby means of the cajolements witnessed this day, a suspicion that Victor\r\nwas wearing a false face over the signification--of Jarniman’s visit\r\nand meant to deceive the trustful and too-devoted loving woman he seemed\r\nbound to wreck, irritated the best of his nature. He had a resolve to\r\npass an hour with the couple, and speak and insist on hearing plain\r\nwords before the night had ended. But Fenellan took it out of him.\r\nVictor’s show of a perfect contentment emulating Pempton’s, incited\r\nColney to some of his cunning rapier-thrusts with his dancing adversary;\r\nand the heat which is planted in us for the composition: of those cool\r\nepigrams, will not allow plain words to follow. Or, handing him over to\r\nthe police of the Philistines, you may put it, that a habit of assorting\r\nspices will render an earnest simplicity distasteful. He was invited\r\nby Nataly to come home with them; her wish for his presence, besides\r\npersonal, was moved by an intuition, that his counsel might specially\r\nbenefit them. He shrugged; he said he had work at his chambers.\r\n\r\n‘Work!’ Victor ejaculated: he never could reach to a right comprehension\r\nof labour, in regard to the very unremunerative occupation of\r\nliterature. Colney he did not want, and he let him go, as Nataly\r\nnoticed, without a sign of the reluctance he showed when the others,\r\nincluding Fenellan, excused themselves.\r\n\r\n‘So! we’re alone?’ he said, when the door of the hall had closed\r\non them. He kept Nesta talking of the success of the day until she,\r\nobserving her mother’s look, simulated the setting-in of a frenzied\r\nyawn. She was kissed, and she tripped to her bed.\r\n\r\n‘Now we are alone,’ Nataly said.\r\n\r\n‘Well, dear, and the day was, you must own... ‘ he sought to trifle with\r\nher heavy voice; but she recalled him: ‘Victor!’ and the naked anguish\r\nin her cry of his name was like a foreign world threatening the one he\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, yes; that man, that Jarniman. You saw him, I remember. You\r\nrecollected him?--stouter than he was. In her service ever since. Well,\r\na little drop of bitter, perhaps: no harm, tonic.’\r\n\r\n‘Victor, is she very ill?’\r\n\r\n‘My love, don’t feel at your side: she is ill, ill, not the extreme\r\ncase: not yet: old and ill. I told Skepsey to give the man refreshment:\r\nhe had to do his errand.’\r\n\r\n‘What? why did he come?’\r\n\r\n‘Curious; he made acquaintance with Skepsey, and appears to have\r\noutwitted poor Skepsey, as far as I see it. But if that woman thinks\r\nof intimidating me now--!’ His eyes brightened; he had sprung from\r\nevasions. ‘Living in flagrant sin, she says: you and I! She will not\r\nhave it; warns me. Heard this day at noon of company at Lakelands.\r\nJarniman off at once. Are to live in obscurity;--you and I! if together!\r\nDictates from her death-bed-I suppose her death-bed.’\r\n\r\n‘Dearest,’ Nataly pressed hand on her left breast, ‘may we not think\r\nthat she may be right?’\r\n\r\n‘An outrageous tyranny of a decrepit woman naming herself wife when she\r\nis only a limpet of vitality, with drugs for blood, hanging-on to blast\r\nthe healthy and vigorous! I remember old Colney’s once, in old days,\r\ncalling that kind of marriage a sarcophagus. It was to me. There I\r\nlay--see myself lying! wasting! Think what you can good of her, by all\r\nmeans! From her bed! despatches that Jarniman to me from her bedside,\r\nwith the word, that she cannot in her conscience allow--what imposition\r\nwas it I practised?... flagrant sin?--it would have been an infinitely\r\nviler.... She is the cause of suffering enough: I bear no more from her;\r\nI’ve come to the limit. She has heard of Lakelands: she has taken one of\r\nher hatreds to the place. She might have written, might have sent me a\r\ngentleman, privately. No: it must be done in dramatic style-for effect:\r\nher confidential--lawyer?--doctor?--butler! Perhaps to frighten me:--the\r\nboy she knew, and--poor soul! I don’t mean to abuse her: but such\r\nconduct as this is downright brutal. I laugh at it, I snap my fingers.\r\nI can afford to despise it. Only I do say it deserves to be called\r\nabominable.’\r\n\r\n‘Victor, has she used a threat?’\r\n\r\n‘Am I brought to listen to any of her threats!--Funny thing, I ‘m\r\ncertain that woman never can think of me except as the boy she knew. I\r\nsaw her first when she was first a widow. She would keep talking to me\r\nof the seductions of the metropolis--kept informing me I was a young\r\nman... shaking her head. I ‘ve told you. She--well, I know we are\r\nmixtures, women as well as men. I can, I hope, grant the same--I believe\r\nI can--allowances to women as to men; we are poor creatures, all of\r\nusing one sense: though I won’t give Colney his footing; there’s a\r\nbetter way of reading us. I hold fast to Nature. No violation of Nature,\r\nmy good Colney! We can live the lives of noble creatures; and I say that\r\nhappiness was meant for us:--just as, when you sit down to your dinner,\r\nyou must do it cheerfully, and you make good blood: otherwise all’s\r\nwrong. There’s the right answer to Colney! But when a woman like\r\nthat .... and marries a boy: well, twenty-one--not quite that: and an\r\ninnocent, a positive innocent--it may seem incredible, after a term of\r\nschool-life: it was a fact: I can hardly understand it myself when I\r\nlook back. Marries him! And then sets to work to persecute him, because\r\nhe has blood in his veins, because he worships beauty; because he seeks\r\na real marriage, a real mate. And, I say it! let the world take its own\r\nview, the world is wrong! because he preferred a virtuous life to the\r\nkind of life she would, she must--why, necessarily!--have driven him to,\r\nwith a mummy’s grain of nature in his body. And I am made of flesh, I\r\nadmit it.’\r\n\r\n‘Victor, dearest, her threat concerns only your living at Lakelands.’\r\n\r\n‘Pray, don’t speak excitedly, my love,’ he replied to the woman whose\r\ntones had been subdued to scarce more than waver. ‘You see how I meet\r\nit: water off a duck’s back, or Indian solar beams on the skin of a\r\nHindoo! I despise it hardly worth contempt;--But, come: our day was\r\na good one. Fenellan worked well. Old Colney was Colney Durance, of\r\ncourse. He did no real mischief.’\r\n\r\n‘And you will not determine to enter Lakelands--not yet, dear?’ said\r\nNataly.\r\n\r\n‘My own girl, leave it all to me.’\r\n\r\n‘But, Victor, I must, must know.’\r\n\r\n‘See the case. You have lots of courage. We can’t withdraw. Her\r\nintention is mischief. I believe the woman keeps herself alive for it:\r\nwe’ve given her another lease!--though it can only be for a very short\r\ntime; Themison is precise; Carling too. If we hold back--I have great\r\nfaith in Themison--the woman’s breath on us is confirmed. We go down,\r\nthen; complete the furnishing, quite leisurely; accept--listen--accept\r\none or two invitations: impossible to refuse!--but they are\r\naccepted!--and we defy her: a crazy old creature: imagines herself the\r\nwife of the ex-Premier, widow of Prince Le Boo, engaged to the Chinese\r\nAmbassador, et caetera. Leave the tussle with that woman to me. No, we\r\ndon’t repeat the error of Crayc Farm and Creckholt. And here we\r\nhave stout friends. Not to speak of Beaver Urmsing: a picture of Old\r\nChristmas England! You took to him?--must have taken to Beaver Urmsing!\r\nThe Marigolds! And Sir Rodwell and Lady Blachington are altogether\r\nabove the mark of Sir Humphrey and Lady Pottil, and those half and half\r\nMountneys. There’s a warm centre of home in Lakelands. But I know my\r\nNataly: she is thinking of our girl. Here is the plan: we stand our\r\nground: my dear soul won’t forsake me only there’s the thought of Fredi,\r\nin the event... improbable enough. I lift Fredi out of the atmosphere\r\nawhile; she goes to my cousins the Duvidney ladies.’\r\n\r\nNataly was hit by a shot. ‘Can you imagine it, Victor?’\r\n\r\n‘Regard it as done.’\r\n\r\n‘They will surely decline!’\r\n\r\n‘Their feeling for General Radnor is a worship.’\r\n\r\n‘All the more...?’\r\n\r\n‘The son inherits it. He goes to them personally. Have you ever known me\r\npersonally fail? Fredi stays at Moorsedge for a month or two. Dorothea\r\nand Virginia Duvidney will give her a taste of a new society; good for\r\nthe girl. All these little shiftings can be turned to good. Meantime, I\r\nsay, we stand our ground: but you are not to be worried; for though we\r\nhave gone too far to recede, we need not and we will not make the entry\r\ninto Lakelands until--you know: that is, auspiciously, to suit you in\r\nevery way. Thus I provide to meet contingencies. What one may really\r\nfancy is, that the woman did but threaten. There’s her point of view to\r\nbe considered: silly, crazy; but one sees it. We are not sure that she\r\nstruck a blow at Craye or Creckholt. I wonder she never wrote. She was\r\nfrightened, when she came to manage her property, of signing her name to\r\nanything. Absurd, that sending of Jarniman! However, it’s her move; we\r\nmake a corresponding disposition of our chessmen.’\r\n\r\n‘And I am to lose my Nesta for a month?’ Nataly said, after catching\r\nhere and there at the fitful gleams of truce or comfort dropped from his\r\nwords. And simultaneously, the reproach of her mind to her nature for\r\nagain and so constantly yielding to the domination of his initiative:\r\nunable to find the words, even the ideas, to withstand him,--brought\r\nbig tears. Angry at herself both for the internal feebleness and the\r\nexhibition of it, she blinked and begged excuse. There might be nothing\r\nthat should call her to resist him. She could not do much worse than\r\nshe had done to-day. The reflection, that to-day she had been actually\r\nsustained by the expectation of a death to come, diminished her estimate\r\nof to-morrow’s burden on her endurance, in making her seem a less\r\ncriminal woman, who would have no such expectation: which was virtually\r\na stab at a fellow creature’s future. Her head was acute to work in the\r\ndirection of the casuistries and the sensational webs and films. Facing\r\nVictor, it was a block.\r\n\r\nBut the thought came: how could she meet those people about Lakelands,\r\nwithout support of the recent guilty whispers! She said coldly, her\r\nheart shaking her: ‘You think there has been a recovery?’\r\n\r\n‘Invalids are up and down. They are--well, no; I should think she dreads\r\nthe...’ he kept ‘surgeon’ out of hearing. ‘Or else she means this for\r\nthe final stroke: “though I’m lying here, I can still make him feel.”\r\n That, or--poor woman--she has her notions of right and wrong.’\r\n\r\n‘Could we not now travel for a few weeks, Victor?’\r\n\r\n‘Certainly, dear; we will, after we have kept our engagements to dine--I\r\naccepted--with the Blathenoys, the Blachingtons, Beaver Urmsing.’\r\n\r\nNataly’s vision of the peaceful lost little dairy cottage swelled to\r\nbrilliance, like the large tear at the fall; darkening under her present\r\neffort to comprehend the necessity it was for him to mix and be foremost\r\nwith the world. Unable to grasp it perfectly in mind, her compassionate\r\nlove embraced it: she blamed herself, for being the obstruction to him.\r\n\r\n‘Very well,’ she said on a sigh. ‘Then we shall not have to let our girl\r\ngo from us?’\r\n\r\n‘Just a few weeks. In the middle of dinner, I scribbled a telegram to\r\nthe Duvidneys, for Skepsey to take.’\r\n\r\n‘Speaking of Nesta?’\r\n\r\n‘Of my coming to-morrow. They won’t stop me. I dine with them, sleep at\r\nthe Wells; hotel for a night. We are to be separated for a night.’\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand in his and gave him a passing view of her face: ‘For\r\ntwo, dear. I am... that man’s visit--rather shaken: I shall have a\r\nbetter chance of sleeping if I know I am not disturbing you.’\r\n\r\nShe was firm; and they kissed and parted. Each had an unphrased\r\nspeculation upon the power of Mrs. Burman to put division between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. TREATS OF THE LADIES’ LAPDOG TASSO FOR AN INSTANCE OF\r\nMOMENTOUS EFFECTS PRODUCED BY VERY MINOR CAUSES\r\n\r\nThe maiden ladies Dorothea and Virginia Duvidney were thin--sweet\r\nold-fashioned grey gentlewomen, demurely conscious of their excellence\r\nand awake to the temptation in the consciousness, who imposed a certain\r\nreflex primness on the lips of the world when addressing them or when\r\nalluding to them. For their appearance was picturesque of the ancestral\r\ntime, and their ideas and scrupulousness of delivery suggested the\r\nbelated in ripeness; orchard apples under a snow-storm; or any image\r\nthat will ceremoniously convey the mind’s profound appreciation together\r\nwith the tooth’s panic dread of tartness. They were by no means tart;\r\nonly, as you know, the tooth is apprehensively nervous; an uninviting\r\nsign will set it on edge. Even the pen which would sketch them has a\r\nspell on it and must don its coat of office, walk the liveried footman\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nTheir wealth, their deeds of charity, their modesty, their built grey\r\nlocks, their high repute; a ‘Chippendale elegance’ in a quaintly formal\r\ncorrectness, that they had, as Colney Durance called it; gave them some\r\nqueenliness, and allowed them to claim the ear as an oracle and banish\r\nrebellious argument. Intuitive knowledge, assisted by the Rev. Stuart\r\nRem and the Rev. Abram Posterley, enabled them to pronounce upon men and\r\nthings; not without effect; their country owned it; the foreigner beheld\r\nit. Nor were they corrupted by the servility of the surrounding ear.\r\nThey were good women, striving to be humbly good. They might, for all\r\nthe little errors they nightly unrolled to then perceptions, have stood\r\nbefore the world for a study in the white of our humanity. And this may\r\nbe but a washed wall, it is true: revolutionary sceptics are measuring\r\nthe depths of it. But the hue refreshes, the world admires; and we\r\nknow it an object of aim to the bettermost of the wealthy. If, happily,\r\ncomplacent circumstances have lifted us to the clean paved platform out\r\nof grip of puddled clay and bespattering wheeltracks, we get our chance\r\nof coming to it.\r\n\r\nPossessing, for example, nine thousand pounds per annum in Consols, and\r\nnot expending the whole of it upon our luxuries, we are, without further\r\nprivation, near to kindling the world’s enthusiasm for whiteness. Yet\r\nthere, too, we find, that character has its problems to solve; there are\r\nshades in salt. We must be charitable, but we should be just; we give to\r\nthe poor of the land, but we are eminently the friends of our servants;\r\nduty to mankind diverts us not from the love we bear to our dog; and\r\nwith a pathetic sorrow for silt, we discard it from sight and hearing.\r\nWe hate dirt. Having said so much, having shown it, by sealing the\r\nmouth of Mr. Stuart Rem and iceing the veins of Mr. Abram Posterley, in\r\nrelation to a dreadful public case and a melancholy private, we have a\r\npleased sense of entry into the world’s ideal.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we protest our unworthiness. Acknowledgeing that they\r\nwere not purely spotless, these ladies genuinely took the tiny fly-spot\r\nfor a spur to purification; and they viewed it as a patch to raise\r\nin relief their goodness. They gazed on it, saw themselves in it, and\r\nveiled it: warned of the cunning of an oft-defeated Tempter.\r\n\r\nTo do good and sleep well, was their sowing and their reaping. Uneasy\r\nconsciences could not have slept. The sleeping served for proof of an\r\naccurate reckoning and an expungeing of the day’s debits. They differed\r\nin opinion now and then, as we see companion waves of the river, blown\r\nby a gust, roll a shadow between them; and almost equally transient were\r\ntheir differences with a world that they condemned when they could not\r\nfeel they (as an embodiment of their principles) were leading it. The\r\nEnglish world at times betrayed a restiveness in the walled pathway of\r\nvirtue; for, alas, it closely neighbours the French; only a Channel,\r\noften dangerously smooth, to divide: but it is not perverted for long;\r\nand the English Funds are always constant and a tower. Would they be\r\nsuffered to be so, if libertinism were in the ascendant?\r\n\r\nColney Durance was acquainted with the Duvidney ladies. Hearing of the\r\njourney to them and the purport of it, he said, with the mask upon glee:\r\n‘Then Victor has met his match!’ Nataly had sent for him to dine with\r\nher in Victor’s absence: she was far from grieved, as to the result, by\r\nhis assurance to her, that Victor had not a chance. Colney thought so.\r\n‘Just like him! to be off gaily to try and overcome or come over the\r\ngreatest power in England.’ They were England herself; the squat\r\nold woman she has become by reason of her overlapping numbers of\r\nthe comfortable fund-holder annuitants: a vast body of passives and\r\nnegatives, living by precept, according to rules of precedent,\r\nand supposing themselves to be righteously guided because of their\r\ncontinuing undisturbed. Them he branded, as hypocritical materialists,\r\nand the country for pride in her sweetmeat plethora of them:--mixed with\r\nan ancient Hebrew fear of offence to an inscrutable Lord, eccentrically\r\nappeasable through the dreary iteration of the litany of sinfulness. He\r\nwas near a truth; and he had the heat of it on him.\r\n\r\nSatirists in their fervours might be near it to grasp it, if they could\r\nbe moved to moral distinctness, mental intention, with a preference of\r\nstrong plain speech over the crack of their whips. Colney could not or\r\nwould not praise our modern adventurous, experimental, heroic, tramping\r\nactive, as opposed to yonder pursy passives and negatives; he had\r\noccasions for flicking the fellow sharply: and to speak of the Lord as\r\nour friend present with us, palpable to Reason, perceptible to natural\r\npiety solely through the reason, which justifies punishment; that would\r\nhave stopped his mouth upon the theme of God-forsaken creatures. Our\r\nsatirist is an executioner by profession, a moralist in excuse, or\r\nat the tail of it; though he thinks the position reversed, when he\r\nmoralizes angrily to have his angry use of the scourge condoned.\r\nNevertheless, he fills a serviceable place; and certainly he is not\r\nhappy in his business. Colney suffered as heavily as he struck. If he\r\nhad been no more than a mime in the motley of satire, he would have\r\nsucked compensation from the acid of his phrases, for the failure to\r\nprick and goad, and work amendment.\r\n\r\nHe dramatized to Nataly some of the scene going on at the Wells:\r\nVictor’s petition; his fugue in urgency of it; the brief reply of Miss\r\nDorothea and her muted echo Miss Virginia. He was rather their apologist\r\nfor refusing. But, as when, after himself listening to their ‘views,’ he\r\nhad deferentially withdrawn from the ladies of Moorsedge, and had then\r\nbeheld their strangely-hatted lieutenants and the regiments of the\r\ntoneless respectable on the pantiles and the mounts, the curse upon\r\nthe satirist impelled him to generalize. The quiet good ladies were\r\nmultiplied: they were ‘the thousands of their sisters, petticoated\r\nor long-coated or buck-skinned; comfortable annuitants under clerical\r\nshepherding, close upon outnumbering the labourers they paralyze at home\r\nand stultify abroad.’ Colney thumped away. The country’s annuitants had\r\nfor type ‘the figure with the helmet of the Owl-Goddess and the trident\r\nof the Earth-shaker, seated on a wheel, at the back of penny-pieces; in\r\nwhom you see neither the beauty of nakedness nor the charm of drapery;\r\nnot the helmet’s dignity or the trident’s power; but she has patently\r\nthat which stops the wheel; and poseing for representative of an\r\nimperial nation, she helps to pass a penny.’ So he passed his\r\nepigram, heedless of the understanding or attention of his hearer; who\r\ntemporarily misjudged him for a man impelled by the vanity of literary\r\npoint and finish, when indeed it was hot satiric spite, justified of its\r\naim, which crushed a class to extract a drop of scathing acid, in the\r\ninterests of the country, mankind as well. Nataly wanted a picture\r\npainted, colours and details, that she might get a vision of the scene\r\nat Moorsedge. She did her best to feel an omen and sound it, in his\r\nquestion ‘whether the yearly increasing army of the orderly annuitants\r\nand their parasites does not demonstrate the proud old country as a\r\nsheath for pith rather than of the vital run of sap.’\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was patriotic to inquire; and doubtless she was the weakest\r\nof women; she could follow no thought; her heart was beating blindly\r\nbeside Victor, hopeing for the refusal painful to her through his\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n‘You think me foolish,’ she made answer to one of Colney’s shrugs; ‘and\r\nit has come to that pitch with me, that I cannot be sensible of a merit\r\nexcept in being one with him--obeying, is the word. And I have never yet\r\nknown him fail. That terrible Lakelands wears a different look to me,\r\nwhen I think of what he can do; though I would give half my days to\r\nescape it.’\r\n\r\nShe harped on the chord of feverish extravagance; the more hateful to\r\nColney because of his perceiving, that she simulated a blind devotedness\r\nto stupefy her natural pride; and he was divided between stamping on her\r\nfor an imbecile and dashing at Victor for a maniac. But her situation\r\nrendered her pitiable. ‘You will learn tomorrow what Victor has done,’\r\nhe said, and thought how the simple words carried the bitterness.\r\n\r\nThat was uttered within a few minutes of midnight, when the ladies of\r\nMoorsedge themselves, after an exhausting resistance to their dearest\r\nrelative, were at the hall-door of the house with Victor, saying the\r\ngood-night, to which he responded hurriedly, cordially, dumbly, a\r\nbaffled man. They clasped hands. Miss Dorothea said:\r\n\r\n‘You, Victor, always.’ Miss Virginia said: ‘You will be sure of\r\nwelcome.’ He walked out upon the moonless night; and for lack of any\r\nrounded object in the smothering darkness to look at, he could nowhere\r\ntake moorings to gather himself together and define the man who had\r\nundergone so portentous a defeat. He was glad of quarters at an hotel, a\r\nsolitary bed, absence from his Nataly.\r\n\r\nFor their parts, the ladies were not less shattered. They had no triumph\r\nin their victory: the weight of it bore them down. They closed, locked,\r\nshot the bolts and fastened the chain of the door. They had to be\r\nreminded by the shaking of their darling dog Tasso’s curly silky coat,\r\nthat he had not taken his evening’s trot to notify malefactors of his\r\nwatchfulness and official wrath at sound of footfall or a fancied one.\r\nWithout consultation, they unbolted the door, and Tasso went forth, to\r\n‘compose his vesper hymn,’ as Mr. Posterley once remarked amusingly.\r\n\r\nThough not pretending to the Muse’s crown so far, the little dog had\r\nqualities to entrance the spinster sex. His mistresses talked of him;\r\nof his readiness to go forth; of the audible first line of his hymn\r\nor sonnet; of his instinct telling him that something was wrong in the\r\nestablishment. For most of the servants at Moorsedge were prostrated by\r\na fashionable epidemic; a slight attack, the doctor said; but Montague,\r\nthe butler, had withdrawn for the nursing of his wife; Perrin, the\r\nfootman, was confined to his chamber; Manton, the favourite maid, had\r\nappeared in the morning with a face that caused her banishment to bed;\r\nand the cook, Mrs. Bannister, then sighingly agreed to send up cold meat\r\nfor the ladies’ dinner. Hence their melancholy inhospitality to their\r\ncousin Victor, who had, in spite of his errors, the right to claim his\r\nplace at their table, was ‘of the blood,’ they said. He was recognized\r\nas the living prince of it. His every gesture, every word, recalled the\r\nGeneral. The trying scene with him had withered them, they did not speak\r\nof it; each had to the other the look of a vessel that has come out of\r\na gale. Would they sleep? They scarcely dared ask it of themselves. They\r\nhad done rightly; silence upon that reflection seemed best. It was\r\nthe silence of an inward agitation; still they knew the power of good\r\nconsciences to summon sleep.\r\n\r\nTasso was usually timed for five minutes. They were astonished to\r\ndiscover by the clock, that they had given him ten. He was very quiet:\r\nif so, and for whatever he did, he had his reason, they said: he was a\r\ndog endowed with reason: endowed--and how they wished that Mr. Stuart\r\nRem would admit it!--with, their love of the little dog believed (and\r\nMr. Posterley acquiesced), a soul. Do but think it of dear animals, and\r\nany form of cruelty to them becomes an impossibility, Mr. Stuart\r\nRem! But he would not be convinced: ungenerously indeed he named Mr.\r\nPosterley a courtier. The ladies could have retorted, that Mr. Posterley\r\nhad not a brother who was the celebrated surgeon Sir Nicholas Rem.\r\n\r\nUsually Tasso came running in when the hall-door was opened to him. Not\r\na sound of him could be heard. The ladies blew his familiar whistle.\r\nHe trotted back to a third appeal, and was, unfortunately for them, not\r\ncaressed; he received reproaches from two forefingers directed straight\r\nat his reason. He saw it and felt it. The hug of him was deferred to the\r\ntender good-night to him in his basket at the foot of the ladies’ beds.\r\n\r\nOn entering their spacious bed-chamber, they were so fatigued that\r\nsleep appeared to their minds the compensating logical deduction. Miss\r\nDorothea suppressed a yawn, and inflicted it upon Miss Virginia, who\r\nreturned it, with an apology, and immediately had her sister’s hand on\r\nher shoulder, for, an attempted control of one of the irresistibles; a\r\nspectacle imparting bitter shudders and shots to the sympathetic jawbones\r\nof an observer. Hand at mouth, for not in privacy would they have been\r\nguilty of exposing a grimace, they signified, under an interim smile,\r\ntheir maidenly submission to the ridiculous force of nature: after\r\nwhich, Miss Virginia retired to the dressing-room, absorbed in woeful\r\nrecollection of the resolute No they had been compelled to reiterate,\r\nin response to the most eloquent and, saving for a single instance,\r\nadmirable man, their cousin, the representative of ‘the blood,’\r\nsupplicating them. A recreant thankfulness coiled within her bosom at\r\nthe thought, that Dorothea, true to her office of speaker, had tasked\r\nherself with the cruel utterance and repetition of the word. Victor’s\r\nwonderful eyes, his voice, yet more than his urgent pleas; and also, in\r\nthe midst of his fiery flood of speech, his gentleness, his patience,\r\npathos, and a man’s tone through it all; were present to her.\r\n\r\nDisrobed, she knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n‘I have called to you twice,’ Dorothea said; and she looked a motive for\r\nthe call.\r\n\r\n‘What is it?’ said Virginia, with faltering sweetness, with a terrible\r\ndivination.\r\n\r\nThe movement of a sigh was made. ‘Are you aware of anything, dear?’\r\n\r\nVirginia was taken with the contrary movement of a sniff. But the fear\r\ninforming it prevented it from being venturesome. Doubt of the pure\r\natmosphere of their bed-chamber, appeared to her as too heretic even for\r\nthe positive essay. In affirming, that she was not aware of anything,\r\nher sight fell on Tasso. His eyeballs were those of a little dog that\r\nhas been awfully questioned.\r\n\r\n‘It is more than a suspicion,’ said Dorothea; and plainly now, while\r\nopen to the seductions of any pleasing infidel testimony, her nose in\r\nrepugnance convicted him absolutely.\r\n\r\nVirginia’s nose was lowered a few inches; it inhaled and stopped midway.\r\n‘You must be mistaken, dear. He never... ‘\r\n\r\n‘But are you insensible to the...’ Dorothea’s eyelids fainted.\r\n\r\nVirginia dismissed the forlornest of efforts at incredulity. A whiff of\r\nTasso had smitten her. ‘Ah!’ she exclaimed and fell away. ‘Is it Tasso!\r\nHow was it you noticed nothing before undressing, dear?’\r\n\r\n‘Thinking of what we have gone through to-night! I forgot him. At last\r\nthe very strange... The like of it I have not ever!... And upon that\r\nthick coat! And, dear, it is late. We are in the morning hours.’\r\n\r\n‘But, my dear-Oh, dear, what is to be done with him?’\r\n\r\nThat was the crucial point for discussion. They had no servant to\r\ngive them aid; Manton, they could not dream of disturbing. And Tasso’s\r\ncharacter was in the estimate; he hated washing; it balefully depraved\r\nhis temper; and not only, creature of habit that he was, would he\r\ndecline to lie down anywhere save in their bedroom, he would lament,\r\nplead, insist unremittingly, if excluded; terrifying every poor\r\ninvalid of the house. Then again, were they at this late hour to dress\r\nthemselves, and take him downstairs, and light a fire in the kitchen,\r\nand boil sufficient water to give him a bath and scrubbing? Cold water\r\nwould be death to him. Besides, he would ring out his alarum for the\r\nhouse to hear, pour out all his poetry, poor dear, as Mr. Posterley\r\ncalled it, at a touch of cold water. The catastrophe was one to weep\r\nover, the dilemma a trial of the strongest intelligences.\r\n\r\nIn addition to reviews of their solitary alternative-the having of a\r\nbefouled degraded little dog in their chamber through the night, they\r\nwere subjected to a conflict of emotions when eyeing him: and there\r\ncame to them the painful, perhaps irreverent, perhaps uncharitable,\r\nthought:--that the sinner who has rolled in the abominable, must cleanse\r\nhim and do things to polish him and perfume before again embraced even\r\nby the mind: if indeed we can ever have our old sentiment for him again!\r\nMr. Stuart Rem might decide it for them. Nay, before even the heart\r\nembraces him, he must completely purify himself. That is to say, the\r\nordinary human sinner--save when a relative. Contemplating Tasso, the\r\nhearts of the ladies gushed out in pity of an innocent little\r\ndog, knowing not evil, dependent on his friends for help to be\r\npurified;--necessarily kept at a distance: the very look of him\r\nprescribed extreme separation, as far as practicable. But they had proof\r\nof a love almost greater than it was previous to the offence, in the\r\ntender precautions they took to elude repulsion.\r\n\r\nHe was rolling on the rug, communicating contagion. Flasks of\r\ntreble-distilled lavender water, and their favourite, traditional in the\r\nfamily, eau d’Arquebusade, were on the toilet-table. They sprinkled\r\nhis basket, liberally sprinkled the rug and the little dog.\r\nPerfume-pastilles were in one of the sitting-rooms below; and Virginia\r\nwould have gone down softly to fetch a box, but Dorothea restrained her,\r\nin pity for the servants, with the remark: ‘It would give us a nightmare\r\nof a Roman Catholic Cathedral!’ A bit of the window was lifted by\r\nDorothea, cautiously, that prowling outsiders might not be attracted.\r\nTasso was wooed to his basket. He seemed inquisitive; the antidote of\r\nhis naughtiness excited him; his tail circled after his muzzle several\r\ntimes; then he lay. A silken scarf steeped in eau d’Arquebusade was\r\nflung across him.\r\n\r\nTheir customary devout observances concluded, lights were extinguished,\r\nand the ladies kissed, and entered their beds.\r\n\r\nTheir beds were not homely to them. Dorothea thought that Virginia was\r\nlong in settling herself. Virginia did not like the sound of Dorothea’s\r\ndouble sigh. Both listened anxiously for the doings of Tasso. He rested.\r\n\r\nHe was uneasy; he was rounding his basket once more; unaware of the\r\nexaggeration of his iniquitous conduct, poor innocent, he shook that\r\ndreadful coat of his! He had displaced the prophylactic cover of the\r\nscarf.\r\n\r\nHe drove them in a despair to speculate on the contention between the\r\nperfume and the stench in junction, with such a doubt of the victory\r\nof which of the two, as drags us to fear our worst. It steals into our\r\nnostrils, possesses them. As the History of Mankind has informed us, we\r\nwere led up to our civilization by the nose. But Philosophy warns us on\r\nthat eminence; to beware of trusting exclusively to our conductor, lest\r\nthe mind of us at least be plunged back into barbarism. The ladies\r\nhated both the cause and the consequence, they had a revulsion from the\r\nobject, of the above contention. But call it not a contention: there is\r\nnobility in that. This was a compromise, a degrading union, with very\r\nsickening results. Whether they came of an excess of the sprinkling,\r\ncould not well be guessed. The drenching at least was righteously\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nBeneath their shut eyelids, they felt more and more the oppression of a\r\ndarkness not laden with slumber. They saw it insolidity; themselves\r\nas restless billows, driven dashing to the despondent sigh. Sleep was\r\ndenied them.\r\n\r\nTasso slept. He had sinned unknowingly, and that is not a spiritual sin;\r\nthe chastisement confers the pardon.\r\n\r\nBut why was this ineffable blessing denied to them? Was it that they\r\nmight have a survey of all the day’s deeds and examine them under the\r\ncruel black beams of Insomnia?\r\n\r\nVirginia said: ‘You are wakeful.’\r\n\r\n‘Thoughtful,’ was the answer.\r\n\r\nA century of the midnight rolled on.\r\n\r\nDorothea said: ‘He behaved very beautifully.’\r\n\r\n‘I looked at the General’s portrait while he besought us,’ Virginia\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n‘One sees him in Victor, at Victor’s age. Try to sleep.’\r\n\r\n‘I do. I pray that you may.’\r\n\r\nSilence courted slumber. Their interchange of speech from the posture of\r\nbodies on their backs, had been low and deliberate, in the tone of\r\nthe vaults. Dead silence recalled the strangeness of it. The night\r\nwas breathless; their open window a peril bestowing no boon. They were\r\nmutually haunted by sound of the gloomy query at the nostrils of each\r\nwhen drawing the vital breath. But for that, they thought they might\r\nhave slept.\r\n\r\nBed spake to bed:\r\n\r\n‘The words of Mr. Stuart Rem last Sunday!’ ‘He said: “Be just.” Could\r\none but see direction!’\r\n\r\n‘In obscurity, feeling is a guide.’\r\n\r\n‘The heart.’\r\n\r\n‘It may sometimes be followed.’\r\n\r\n‘When it concerns the family.’\r\n\r\n‘He would have the living, who are seeking peace, be just.’\r\n\r\n‘Not to assume the seat of justice.’\r\n\r\nAgain they lay as tombstone effigies, that have committed the passage of\r\naffairs to another procession of the Ages.\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle sniff, in hopeless confirmation of the experience of\r\nits predecessors. A sister to it ensued.\r\n\r\n‘Could Victor have spoken so, without assurance in his conscience, that\r\nhis entreaty was righteously addressed to us? that we...’\r\n\r\n‘And no others!’\r\n\r\n‘I think of his language. He loves the child.’\r\n\r\n‘In heart as in mind, he is eminently gifted; acknowledgeing error.’\r\n\r\n‘He was very young.’\r\n\r\nThe huge funereal minutes conducted their sonorous hearse, the hour.\r\n\r\nIt struck in the bed-room: Three.\r\n\r\nNo more than three of the clock, it was the voice telling of half the\r\nprecious restorative night-hours wasted.\r\n\r\nNow, as we close our eyelids when we would go to sleep, so must we,\r\nin expectation of the peace of mind granting us the sweet oblivion,\r\npreliminarily do something which invokes, that we may obtain it.\r\n\r\n‘Dear,’ Dorothea said.\r\n\r\n‘I know indeed,’ said Virginia.\r\n\r\n‘We may have been!’\r\n\r\n‘Not designingly.’\r\n\r\n‘Indeed not. But harsh it may be named, if the one innocent is to be the\r\nsufferer.’\r\n\r\n‘The child can in no sense be adjudged guilty.’\r\n\r\n‘It is Victor’s child.’\r\n\r\n‘He adores the child.’\r\n\r\nWheels were in mute motion within them; and presently the remark was\r\ntossed-up:\r\n\r\n‘In his coming to us, it is possible to see paternal solicitude’\r\n\r\nThence came fruit of reflection:\r\n\r\n‘To be instrumental as guides to a tender young life!’\r\n\r\nReflection heated with visions:\r\n\r\n‘Once our dream!’\r\n\r\nThey had the happier feeling of composure, though Tasso possessed\r\nthe room. Not Tasso, but a sublimated offensiveness, issue of the\r\nantagonistically combined, dispersed to be the more penetrating;\r\ninsomuch that it seemed to them they could not ever again make use of\r\neau d’Arquebusade without the vitiating reminder. So true were the words\r\nof Mr. Stuart Rem: ‘Half measures to purification are the most delusive\r\nof our artifices.’ Fatigue and its reflections helped to be peacefuller.\r\nTheir souls were mounting to a serenity above the nauseating\r\ndegradation, to which the poor little dog had dragged them.\r\n\r\n‘Victor gave his promise.’\r\n\r\n‘At least, concession would not imply contact with the guilty.’\r\n\r\nBoth sighed as they took up the burden of the vaporous Tasso to drop\r\nhim; with the greater satisfaction in the expelling of their breath.\r\n\r\n‘It might be said, dear, that concession to his entreaty does not in any\r\nway countenance the sin.’\r\n\r\n‘I can see, dear, how it might be read as a reproof.’\r\n\r\nTheir exchange of sentences followed meditative pauses; Dorothea\r\nleading.\r\n\r\n‘To one so sensitive as Victor!’\r\n\r\n‘A month or two of our society for the child!’\r\n\r\n‘It is not the length of time.’\r\n\r\n‘The limitation assures against maternal claims.’\r\n\r\n‘She would not dare.’\r\n\r\n‘He used the words: “her serious respect” for us. I should not wish to\r\nlisten to him often.’\r\n\r\n‘We listen to a higher.’\r\n\r\n‘It may really be, that the child is like him.’\r\n\r\n‘Not resembling Mr. Stuart Rem’s Clementina!’\r\n\r\n‘A week of that child gave us our totally sleepless night.’ ‘One thinks\r\nmore hopefully of a child of Victor’s.’\r\n\r\n‘He would preponderate.’\r\n\r\n‘He would.’\r\n\r\nThey sighed; but it was now with the relief of a lightened oppression.\r\n\r\n‘If, dear, in truth the father’s look is in the child, he has the\r\ngreater reason to desire for her a taste of our atmosphere.’\r\n\r\n‘Do not pursue it. Sleep.’\r\n\r\n‘One prayer!’\r\n\r\n‘Your mention of our atmosphere, dear, destroys my power to frame one.\r\nDo you, for two. But I would cleanse my heart.’\r\n\r\n‘There is none purer.’\r\n\r\n‘Hush.’\r\n\r\nVirginia spoke a more fervent word of praise of her sister, and had not\r\nthe hushing response to it. She heard the soft regular breathing. Her\r\nown was in downy fellowship with it a moment later.\r\n\r\nAt the hour of nine, in genial daylight, sitting over the crumbs of his\r\nhotel breakfast, Victor received a little note that bore the handwriting\r\nof Dorothea Duvidney.\r\n\r\n   ‘Dear Victor, we are prepared to receive the child for a month.\r\n   In haste, before your train. Our love. D. and V.’\r\n\r\nHis face flashed out of cloud.\r\n\r\nA more precious document had never been handed to him. It chased back to\r\nmidnight the doubt hovering over his belief in himself;--phrased to\r\nsay, that he was no longer the Victor Radnor known to the world. And it\r\nextinguished a corpse-like recollection of a baleful dream in the night.\r\nHere shone radiant witness of his being the very man; save for the spot\r\nof his recent confusion in distinguishing his identity or in feeling\r\nthat he stood whole and solid.--Because of two mature maiden ladies?\r\nYes, because of two maiden ladies, my good fellow. And friend Colney,\r\nyou know the ladies, and what the getting round them for one’s purposes\r\nreally means.\r\n\r\nThe sprite of Colney Durance had struck him smartly overnight. Victor’s\r\ninternal crow was over Colney now. And when you have the optimist\r\nand pessimist acutely opposed in a mixing group, they direct lively\r\nconversations at one another across the gulf of distance, even of\r\ntime. For a principle is involved, besides the knowledge of the other’s\r\ntriumph or dismay. The couple are scales of a balance; and not before\r\nlast night had Victor ever consented to think of Colney ascending while\r\nhe dropped low to graze the pebbles.\r\n\r\nHe left his hotel for the station, singing the great aria of the fourth\r\nAct of the Favorita: neglected since that mighty German with his\r\nRienzi, and Tannhauser, and Tristan and Isolda, had mastered him, to\r\nthe displacement of his boyhood’s beloved sugary -inis and -antes\r\nand-zettis; had clearly mastered, not beguiled, him; had wafted him up\r\nto a new realm, invigorating if severer. But now his youth would have\r\nits voice. He travelled up to town with Sir Abraham Quatley and talked,\r\nand took and gave hints upon City and Commercial affairs, while the\r\nhoneyed Italian of the conventional, gloriously animal, stress and\r\nflutter had a revel in his veins, now and then mutedly ebullient at the\r\nmouth: honeyed, golden, rich in visions;--having surely much more of\r\nNature’s encouragement to her children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. NESTA’S ENGAGEMENT\r\n\r\nA word in his ear from Fenellan, touching that man Blathenoy, set the\r\nwheels of Victor’s brain at work upon his defences, for a minute, on\r\nthe walk Westward. Who knew?--who did not know! He had a torpid\r\nconsciousness that he cringed to the world, with an entreaty to the\r\ngreat monster to hold off in ignorance; and the next instant, he had\r\ncaught its miserable spies by the lurcher neck and was towering. He\r\ndwelt on his contempt of them, to curtain the power they could stir.\r\n\r\n‘The little woman, you say, took to Dartrey?’\r\n\r\nFenellan, with the usual apologetic moderation of a second statement,\r\nthought ‘there was the look of it.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, we must watch over her. Dartrey!--but Dartrey’s an honest fellow\r\nwith women. But men are men. Very few men spare a woman when the mad fit\r\nis on her. A little woman-pretty little woman!--wife to Jacob Blathenoy!\r\nShe mustn’t at her age have any close choosing--under her hand. And\r\nDartrey’s just the figure to strike a spark in a tinder-box head.’\r\n\r\n‘With a husband who’d reduce Minerva’s to tinder, after a month of him!’\r\n\r\n‘He spent his honeymoon at his place at Wrensham; told me so.’ Blathenoy\r\nhad therefore then heard of the building of Lakelands by the Victor\r\nRadnor of the City; and had then, we guess--in the usual honeymoon\r\nboasting of a windbag with his bride--wheezed the foul gossip, to hide\r\nhis emptiness and do duty for amusement of the pretty little caged bird.\r\nProbably so. But Victor knew that Blathenoy needed him and feared\r\nhim. Probably the wife had been enjoined to keep silence; for the\r\nBlachingtons, Fannings and others were, it could be sworn, blank and\r\nunscratched folio sheets on the subject:--as yet; unless Mrs. Burman had\r\ndropped venom.\r\n\r\n‘One pities the little woman, eh, Fenellan?’\r\n\r\n‘Dartrey won’t be back for a week or so; and they’re off to Switzerland,\r\nafter the dinner they give. I heard from him this morning; one of the\r\nClanconans is ill.\r\n\r\n‘Lucky. But wherever Blathenoy takes her, he must be the same “arid\r\nbore,” as old Colney says.’\r\n\r\n‘A domestic simoom,’ said Fenellan, booming it: and Victor had a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n‘Awful thing, marriage, to some women! We chain them to that domestic\r\nround; most of them haven’t the means of independence or a chance of\r\nwinning it; and all that’s open to them, if they’ve made a bad cast for\r\na mate--and good Lord! how are they to know before it’s too late!--they\r\nhaven’t a choice except to play tricks or jump to the deuce or sit and\r\n“drape in blight,” as Colney has it; though his notion of the optional\r\nmarriages, broken or renewed every seven years!--if he means it. You\r\nnever know, with him. It sounds like another squirt of savage irony.\r\nIt’s donkey nonsense, eh?’\r\n\r\n‘The very hee-haw of nonsense,’ Fenellan acquiesced.\r\n\r\n‘Come, come; read your Scriptures; donkeys have shown wisdom,’ Victor\r\nsaid, rather leaning to the theme of a fretfulness of women in the legal\r\nyoke. ‘They’re donkeys till we know them for prophets. Who can tell!\r\nColney may be hailed for one fifty years hence.’\r\n\r\nFenellan was not invited to enter the house, although the loneliness\r\nof his lodgeings was known, and also, that he played whist at his Club.\r\nVictor had grounds for turning to him at the door and squeezing his\r\nhand warmly, by way of dismissal. In ascribing them to a weariness at\r\nFenellan’s perpetual acquiescence, he put the cover on them, and he\r\nstamped it with a repudiation of the charge, that Colney’s views upon\r\nthe great Marriage Question were the ‘very hee-haw of nonsense.’ They\r\nwere not the hee-haw; in fact, viewing the host of marriages, they were\r\nfor discussion; there was no bray about them. He could not feel them to\r\nbe absurd while Mrs. Burman’s tenure of existence barred the ceremony.\r\nAnything for a phrase! he murmured of Fenellan’s talk; calling him, Dear\r\nold boy, to soften the slight.\r\n\r\nNataly had not seen Fenellan or heard from Dartrey; so she continued to\r\nbe uninformed of her hero’s release; and that was in the order of happy\r\naccidents. She had hardly to look her interrogation for the news; it\r\nradiated. But he stated such matter-of-course briefly. ‘The good ladies\r\nare ready to receive our girl.’\r\n\r\nHer chagrin resolved to a kind of solace of her draggled pride, in the\r\nidea, that he who tamed everybody to submission, might well have command\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nThe note, signed D. and V., was shown.\r\n\r\nThere stood the words. And last night she had been partly of the opinion\r\nof Colney Durance. She sank down among the unreasoning abject;--not this\r\ntime with her perfect love of him, but with a resistance and a dubiety\r\nunder compression. For she had not quite comprehended why Nesta should\r\ngo. This readiness of the Duvidney ladies to receive the girl, stopped\r\nher mental inquiries.\r\n\r\nShe begged for a week’s delay; ‘before the parting’; as her dear old\r\nsilly mother’s pathos whimpered it, of the separation for a month! and\r\nhe smiled and hummed pleasantly at any small petition, thinking her in\r\nerror to expect Dartrey’s return to town before the close of a week; and\r\nthen wondering at women, mildly denouncing in his heart the mothers who\r\nran risk of disturbing their daughters’ bosoms with regard to particular\r\nheroes married or not. Dartrey attracted women: he was one of the men\r\nwho do it without effort. Victor’s provident mind blamed the mother for\r\nthe indiscreetness of her wish to have him among them. But Dudley had\r\nbeen making way bravely of late; he improved; he began to bloom, like a\r\nSpring flower of the garden protected from frosts under glass; and Fredi\r\nwas the sheltering and nourishing bestower of the lessons. One could\r\nsee, his questions and other little points revealed, that he had a\r\ncertain lover’s dread of Dartrey Fenellan; a sort of jealousy: Victor\r\nunderstood the feeling. To love a girl, who has her ideal of a man\r\nelsewhere in another; though she may know she never can wed the man, and\r\nhas not the hope of it; is torment to the lover quailing, as we do in\r\nthis terrible season of the priceless deliciousness, stripped against\r\nall the winds that blow; skinless at times. One gets up a sympathy for\r\nthe poor shy dependent shivering lover. Nevertheless, here was young\r\nDudley waking, visibly becoming bolder. As in the flute-duets, he gained\r\nfire from concert. The distance between Cronidge and Moorsedge was two\r\nmiles and a quarter.\r\n\r\nInstead of the delay of a whole week, Victor granted four days, which\r\nembraced a musical evening at Mrs. John Cormyn’s on the last of the\r\ndays, when Nesta was engaged to sing with her mother a duet of her own\r\ncomposition, the first public fruit of her lessons in counterpoint from\r\nrigid Herr Strauscher, who had said what he had said, in letting it\r\npass: eulogy, coming from him. So Victor heard, and he doated am the\r\nsurprise to come for him, in a boyish anticipation. The girl’s little\r\nFrench ballads under tutelage of Louise de Seilles promised, though they\r\nwere imitative. If Strauscher let this pass... Victor saw Grand Opera\r\nsomewhere to follow; England’s claim to be a creative musical nation\r\nvindicated; and the genius of the fair sex as well.\r\n\r\nHe heard the duet at Mrs. Cormyn’s; and he imagined a hearing of\r\nhis Fredi’s Opera, and her godmother’s delight in it; the once famed\r\nSanfredini’s consent to be the diva at a rehearsal, and then her\r\ncompelling her hidalgo duque to consent further: an event not\r\ninconceivable. For here was downright genius; the flowering aloe of the\r\nmany years in formation; and Colney admitted the song to have a streak\r\nof genius; though he would pettishly and stupidly say, that our modern\r\nnewspaper Press is able now to force genius for us twenty or so to the\r\nmonth, excluding Sundays-our short pauses for the incubation of it. Real\r\nrare genius was in that song, nothing forced; and exquisite melody; one\r\nof those melodies which fling gold chains about us and lead us off, lead\r\nus back into Eden. Victor hummed at bars of it on the drive homeward.\r\nHis darlings had to sing it again in the half-lighted drawing-room.\r\nThe bubble-happiness of the three was vexed only by tidings heard from\r\nColney during the evening of a renewed instance of Skepsey’s misconduct.\r\nPriscilla Graves had hurried away to him at the close of Mr. John\r\nCormyn’s Concert, in consequence; in grief and in sympathy. Skepsey was\r\nto appear before the magistrate next morning, for having administered\r\nphysical chastisement to his wife during one of her fits of drunkenness.\r\nColney had seen him. His version of the story was given, however, in the\r\nobjectionable humorous manner: none could gather from it of what might\r\nbe pleaded for Skepsey. His ‘lesson to his wife in the art of pugilism,\r\nbefore granting her Captain’s rank among the Defensive Amazons of Old\r\nEngland,’ was the customary patent absurdity. But it was odd, that\r\nSkepsey always preferred his appeal for help to Colney Durance. Nesta\r\nproposed following Priscilla that night. She had hinted her wish, on the\r\nway home; she was urgent, beseeching, when her father lifted praises\r\nof her: she had to start with her father by the train at seven in the\r\nmorning, and she could not hear of poor Skepsey for a number of hours.\r\nShe begged a day’s delay; which would enable her, she said, to join them\r\nin dining at the Blachingtons’, and seeing dear Lakelands again. ‘I was\r\ninvited, you know.’ She spoke in childish style, and under her eyes she\r\nbeheld her father and mother exchange looks. He had a fear that Nataly\r\nmight support the girl’s petition. Nataly read him to mean, possible\r\ndangers among the people at Wrensham. She had seemed hesitating. After\r\nmeeting Victor’s look, her refusal was firm. She tried to make it one of\r\ndistress for the use of the hard word to her own dear girl. Nesta spied\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nBut what was it? There was a reason for her going! She had a right to\r\nstay, and see and talk with Captain Dartrey, and she was to be deported!\r\n\r\nSo now she set herself to remember little incidents at Creckholt:\r\nparticularly a conversation in a very young girl’s hearing, upon Sir\r\nHumphrey and Lady Pottil’s behaviour to the speakers, her parents. She\r\nhad then, and she now had, an extraordinary feeling, as from a wind\r\nstriking upon soft summer weather off regions of ice, that she was in\r\nher parents’ way. How? The feeling was irrational; it could give her\r\nno reply, or only the multitudinous which are the question violently\r\nrepeated. She slept on it.\r\n\r\nShe and her father breakfasted by the London birds’ first twitter.\r\nThey talked of Skepsey. She spoke of her going as exile. ‘No,’ said he,\r\n‘you’re sure to meet friends.’\r\n\r\nHer cheeks glowed. It came wholly through the suddenness of the\r\nrecollection, that the family-seat of one among the friends was near the\r\nWells.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to fancy, as it suited him to fancy, that a vivid secret\r\npleasure laid the colour on those ingenuous fair cheeks.\r\n\r\n‘A solitary flute for me, for a month! I shall miss my sober comrade:\r\ngot the habit of duetting: and he’s gentle, bears with me.’\r\n\r\nTears lined her eyelids. ‘Who would not be, dearest dada! But there is\r\nnothing to bear except the honour.’\r\n\r\n‘You like him? You and I always have the same tastes, Fredi.’\r\n\r\nNow there was a reddening of the sun at the mount; all the sky aflame.\r\nHow could he know that it was not the heart in the face! She reddened\r\nbecause she had perused his wishes; had detected a scheme striking off\r\nfrom them, and knew a man to be the object of it; and because she had at\r\nthe same time the sense of a flattery in her quick divination; and she\r\nwas responsively emotional, her blood virginal; often it was a tropical\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nIt looked like the heart doing rich painter’s work on maiden features.\r\nVictor was naturally as deceived as he wished to be.\r\n\r\nFrom his being naturally so, his remarks on Dudley had an air of\r\nembracing him as one of the family. ‘His manner to me just hits me.’\r\n\r\n‘I like to see him with you,’ she said.\r\n\r\nHer father let his tongue run: ‘One of the few young men I feel\r\nperfectly at home with! I do like dealing with a gentleman. I can\r\nconfide in a gentleman: honour, heart, whatever I hold dearest.’\r\n\r\nThere he stopped, not too soon. The girl was mute, fully agreeing,\r\nslightly hardening. She had a painful sense of separation from her dear\r\nLouise. And it was now to be from her mother as well: she felt the pain\r\nwhen kissing her mother in bed. But this was moderated by the prospect\r\nof a holiday away out of reach of Mr. Barmby’s pursuing voice, whom her\r\nmother favoured: and her mother was concealing something from her;\r\nso she could not make the confidante of her mother. Nataly had no\r\nforewarnings. Her simple regrets filled her bosom. All night she had\r\nbeen taking her chastisement, and in the morning it seemed good to her,\r\nthat she should be denuded, for her girl to learn the felicity of having\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, over which Nataly mused in the succeeding hours, the\r\ngirl had not spoken of any visit her mother was to pay to the Duvidney\r\nladies or they to her. Latterly she had not alluded to her mother’s\r\nfamily. It might mean, that the beloved and dreaded was laying finger\r\non a dark thing in the dark; reading syllables by touch; keeping silence\r\nover the communications to a mind not yet actively speculative, as it is\r\na way with young women. ‘With young women educated for the market, to\r\nbe timorous, consequently secretive, rather snaky,’ Colney Durance had\r\nsaid. Her Nesta was not one of the ‘framed and glazed’ description,\r\ncited by him, for an example of the triumph of the product; ‘exactly\r\nharmonious with the ninny male’s ideal of female innocence.’ No; but\r\nwhat if the mother had opened her heart to her girl? It had been of late\r\nher wish or a dream, shaping hourly to a design, now positively to go\r\nthrough that furnace. Her knowledge of Victor’s objection, restrained\r\nan impulse that had not won spring enough to act against his counsel or\r\nvivify an intelligence grown dull in slavery under him, with regard\r\nto the one seeming right course. The adoption of it would have wounded\r\nhim--therefore her. She had thought of him first; she had also thought\r\nof herself, and she blamed herself now. She went so far as to think,\r\nthat Victor was guilty of the schemer’s error of counting human\r\ncreatures arithmetically, in the sum, without the estimate of\r\ndistinctive qualities and value here and there. His return to a\r\nshivering sensitiveness on the subject of his girl’s enlightenment\r\n‘just yet,’ for which Nataly pitied and loved him, sharing it, with\r\nhumiliation for doing so, became finally her excuse. We must have some\r\nexcuse, if we would keep to life.\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s case appeared in the evening papers. He confessed, ‘frankly,’\r\nhe said, to the magistrate, that, ‘acting under temporary exasperation,\r\nhe had lost for a moment a man’s proper self-command.’ He was as frank\r\nin stating, that he ‘occupied the prisoner’s place before his Worship a\r\nsecond time, and was a second time indebted to the gentleman, Mr. Colney\r\nDurance, who so kindly stood by him.’ There was hilarity in the Court at\r\nhis quaint sententious envelopment of the idiom of the streets, which\r\nhe delivered with solemnity: ‘He could only plead, not in absolute\r\njustification--an appeal to human sentiments--the feelings of a man of\r\nthe humbler orders, returning home in the evening, and his thoughts upon\r\nthings not without their importance, to find repeatedly the guardian\r\nof his household beastly drunk, and destructive.’ Colney made the case\r\nquite intelligible to the magistrate; who gravely robed a strain of the\r\nidiomatic in the officially awful, to keep in tune with his delinquent.\r\nNo serious harm had been done to the woman. Skepsey was admonished and\r\nreleased. His wife expressed her willingness to forgive him, now he had\r\ngot his lesson; and she hoped he would understand, that there was no\r\nneed for a woman to learn pugilism. Skepsey would have explained; but\r\nthe case was over, he was hustled out.\r\n\r\nHowever, a keen young reporter present smelt fun for copy; he followed\r\nthe couple; and in a particular evening Journal, laughable matter was\r\nprinted concerning Skepsey’s view of the pugilism to be imparted to\r\nwomen for their physical-protection in extremity, and the distinction\r\nof it from the blow conveying the moral lesson to them; his wife having\r\nobjected to the former, because it annoyed her and he pestered her; and\r\nshe was never, she said, ready to stand up to him for practice, as he\r\ncalled it, except when she had taken more than he thought wholesome\r\nfor her: he had no sense. There was a squabble between them, because\r\nhe chose to scour away to his master’s office instead of conducting her\r\nhome with the honours. Nesta read the young reporter’s version, with\r\nshrieks. She led the ladies of Moorsedge to discover amusement in it.\r\n\r\nAt first, as her letter to her mother described them, they were like a\r\npair of pieces of costly China, with the settled smile, and cold. She\r\nsaw but the outside of them, and she continued reporting the variations,\r\nwhich steadily determined the warmth. On the night of the third day,\r\nthey kissed her tenderly; they were human figures.\r\n\r\nNo one could be aware of the trial undergone by the good ladies in\r\nreceiving her: Victor’s child; but, as their phrase would have run,\r\nhad they dared to give it utterance to one another, a child of sin. How\r\nforeign to them, in that character, how strange, when she was looked on\r\nas an inhabitant of their house, they hardly dared to estimate; until\r\nthe timorous estimation, from gradually swelling, suddenly sank; nature\r\ninvaded them; they could discard the alienating sense of the taint; and\r\nnot only did they no longer fear the moment when Mr. Stuart Rem or Mr.\r\nPosterley might call for evening tea, but they consulted upon inviting\r\nthe married one of those gentlemen, to ‘divert dear Nesta.’ Every night\r\nshe slept well. In all she did, she proved she was ‘of the blood.’ She\r\nhad Victor’s animated eyes; she might have, they dreaded to think,\r\nhis eloquence. They put it down to his eloquence entirely, that their\r\nresistance to his petition had been overcome, for similarly with the\r\ntreatment of the private acts of royal personages by lacquey History,\r\nthere is, in the minds of the ultra-civilized, an insistance, that\r\nany event having a consequence in matters personal to them, be at all\r\nhazards recorded with the utmost nicety in decency. By such means, they\r\npreserve the ceremonial self-respect, which is a necessity of their\r\nexistence; and so they maintain the regal elevation over the awe-struck\r\nsubjects of their interiors; who might otherwise revolt, pull down,\r\nscatter, dishonour, expose for a shallow fiction the holiest, the most\r\nvital to them. A democratic evil spirit is abroad, generated among\r\ncongregations, often perilously communicating its wanton laughter to the\r\ndesperate wickedness they know (not solely through the monition of Mr.\r\nStuart Rem) to lurk within. It has to be excluded: on certain points\r\nthey must not think. The night of Tasso was darkly clouded in the minds\r\nof the pure ladies: a rift would have seized their half-slumbering sense\r\nof smell, to revive the night, perhaps disorder the stately march of\r\ntheir intelligences.\r\n\r\nVictor’s eloquence, Victor’s influence, Victor’s child he carried them\r\nas a floodstream, insomuch, that their reception of this young creature\r\nof the blot on her birth, was regarded by them in the unmentioned\r\nabstract, and the child’s presence upon earth seen with the indulgence\r\n(without the naughty curiosity) of the loyal moral English for the\r\nnumerous offspring of the peccadillos of their monarchs. These things\r\npass muster from being ‘Britannically cocooned in the purple,’ says our\r\nirreverent satirist; and the maiden ladies’ passion of devotion to ‘the\r\nblood’ helped to blind them; but still more so did the imperious urgency\r\nto curtain closely the night of Tasso, throwing all its consequences\r\nupon Victor’s masterful tongue. Whence it ensued (and here is the danger\r\nfor illogical individuals as well as vast communities, who continue to\r\nbatten upon fiction when the convenience of it has taken the place of\r\npleasure), that they had need to exalt his eloquence, for a cloak to\r\ntheir conduct; and doing it, they fell into a habit of yielding to him;\r\nthey disintegrated under him; rules, principles, morality, were shaken\r\nto some confusion. And still proceeding thus, they now and then glanced\r\nback, more wonderingly than convicted sinners upon their days of early\r\ninnocence, at the night when successfully they withstood him. They\r\nwho had doubted of the rightness of letting Victor’s girl come into\r\ncollision with two clerical gentlemen, one of whom was married,\r\npermitted him now to bring the Hon. Dudley Sowerby to their house, and\r\nmake appointments to meet Mr. Dudley Sowerby under a roof that sheltered\r\na young lady, evidently the allurement to the scion of aristocracy;\r\nof whose family Mr. Stuart Rem had spoken in the very kindling hushed\r\ntones, proper to the union of a sacerdotal and an English citizen’s\r\nveneration.\r\n\r\nHow would it end? And if some day this excellent Mr. Dudley Sowerby\r\nreproached them! He could not have a sweeter bride, one more truly a\r\nlady in education and manners; but the birth! the child’s name! Their\r\ntrouble was emitted in a vapour of interjections. Very perplexing was it\r\nfor the good ladies of strict principles to reflect, as dimly they\r\ndid, that the concrete presence of dear Nesta silenced and overcame\r\nobjections to her being upon earth. She seemed, as it were, a draught of\r\nredoubtable Nature inebriating morality. But would others be similarly\r\naffected? Victor might get his release, to do justice to the mother: it\r\nwould not cover the child. Prize as they might the quality of the Radnor\r\nblood (drawn from the most ancient of original Britain’s princes), there\r\nwas also the Cantor blood for consideration; and it was old, noble,\r\nproud. Would it be satisfied in matching itself with great wealth, a\r\nradiant health, and the good looks of a young flower? For the sake of\r\nthe dear girl, the ladies hoped that it would; and they enlarged the\r\noutline of their wedding present, while, in their minds, the noble\r\nEnglish family which could be satisfied so, was lowered, partaking of\r\nthe taint they had personally ceased to recognize.\r\n\r\nOf one thing they were sure, and it enlisted them: the gentleman loved\r\nthe girl. Her love of him, had it been prominent to view, would have\r\nstirred a feminine sigh; not more, except a feminine lecture to follow.\r\nShe was quite uninflamed, fresh and cool as a spring. His ardour had no\r\ndisguise. They measured him by the favourite fiction’s heroes of their\r\nyouth, and found him to gaze, talk, comport himself, according to the\r\nprescription; correct grammar, finished sentences, all that is expected\r\nof a gentleman enamoured; and ever with the watchful intentness for\r\nhis lady’s faintest first dawn of an inclining to a wish. Mr. Dudley\r\nSowerby’s eye upon Nesta was really an apprentice. There is in Love’s\r\nyoung season a magnanimity in the male kind. Their superior strength\r\nand knowledge are made subservient to the distaff of the weaker and\r\nshallower: they crown her queen; her look is their mandate. So was it\r\nwhen Sir Charles and Sir Rupert and the estimable Villiers Davenant\r\ntouched maidenly hearts to throb: so is it now, with the Hon. Dudley\r\nSowerby.\r\n\r\nVery haltingly, the ladies were guilty of a suggestion to Victor. ‘Oh!\r\nFredi?’ said he; ‘admires her, no doubt; and so do I, so we all do;\r\nshe’s one of the nice girls; but as to Cupid’s darts, she belongs to the\r\ncucumber family, and he shoots without fireing. We shall do the mischief\r\nif we put an interdict. Don’t you remember the green days when obstacles\r\nwere the friction to light that match?’ Their pretty nod of assent\r\ndisplayed the virgin pride of the remembrance: they dreamed of having\r\nonce been exceedingly wilful; it refreshed their nipped natures; and\r\ndwelling on it, they forgot to press their suggestion. Incidentally,\r\nhe named the sum his Fredi would convey to her husband; with, as was\r\ncalculable, the further amount his only child would inherit. A curious\r\neffect was produced on them. Though they were not imaginatively\r\nmercenary, as the creatures tainted with wealth commonly are, they\r\ntalked of the sum over and over in the solitude of their chamber. ‘Dukes\r\nhave married for less.’ Such an heiress, they said, might buy up a\r\nPrincipality. Victor had supplied them with something of an apology to\r\nthe gentleman proposing to Nesta in their house.\r\n\r\nThe chronicle of it is, that Dudley Sowerby did this on the fifteenth\r\nday of September; and that it was not known to the damsel’s parents\r\nbefore the twenty-third; as they were away on an excursion in South\r\nTyrol:--away, flown, with just a word of the hurried departure to their\r\nenvious, exiled girl; though they did not tell her of new constructions\r\nat the London house partly causing them to fly. Subject to their\r\nconsent, she wrote, she had given hers. The letter was telegramic on the\r\nessential point. She wrote of Mr. Barmby’s having visited Mr. Posterley\r\nat the Wells, and she put it just as flatly. Her principal concern, to\r\njudge by her writing, was, to know what Mr. Durance had done, during her\r\nabsence, with the group of emissary-advocates of the various tongues of\r\nEurope on board the steam-Liner conducting them the first stage of their\r\njourney to the Court of Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon Fenellan had written his opinion, that all these delegates of\r\nthe different European nationalities were nothing other than dupes of\r\na New-York Syndicate of American Humorists, not without an eye on the\r\nmainchance; and he was sure they would be set to debate publicly, before\r\nan audience of high-priced tickets, in the principal North American\r\nCities, previous to the embarcation for Japan at San Francisco. Mr.\r\nFenellan eulogized the immense astuteness of Dr. Gannius in taking\r\nhis daughter Delphica with him. Dr. Gannius had singled forth poor Dr.\r\nBouthoin for the object of his attacks; but Nesta was chiefly anxious\r\nto hear of Delphica’s proceedings; she was immensely interested in\r\nDelphica, and envied her; and the girl’s funny speculations over the\r\nplay of Delphica’s divers arts upon the Greek, and upon the Russian,\r\nand upon the English curate Mr. Semhians, and upon M. Falarique--set\r\nGallically pluming and crowing out of an Alsace-Lorraine growl--were\r\nclever. Only, in such a letter, they were amazing.\r\n\r\nNataly received it at Campiglio, when about to start for an excursion\r\ndown the Sarca Valley to Arco. Her letter of reply was delayed. One to\r\nVictor from Dudley Sowerby, awaited them, on their return. ‘Confirms\r\nFredi,’ he said, showing it, and praising it as commendable, properly\r\nfervid. She made pretence to read, she saw the words.\r\n\r\nHer short beat of wings was over. She had joined herself with Victor’s\r\nleap for a change, thirsting for the scenery of the white peaks in\r\nheaven, to enjoy through his enjoyment, if her own capacity was dead:\r\nand she had found it revive, up to some recovery of her old songful\r\nreadiness for invocations of pleasure. Escape and beauty beckoned ahead;\r\nbehind were the chains. These two letters of the one fact plucked her\r\nback. The chained body bore the fluttering spirit: or it was the spirit\r\nin bonds, that dragged the body. Both were abashed before the image of\r\nher girl. Out of the riddle of her strange Nesta, one thing was clear:\r\nshe did not love the man: and Nataly tasted gladness in that, from the\r\ncup of poisonous regrets at the thought. Her girl’s heart would not\r\nbe broken. But if he so strongly loved her, as to hold to this\r\nengagement?... It might then be worse. She dropped a plumb-line into the\r\nyoung man, sounding him by what she knew of him and judged. She had to\r\nrevert to Nesta’s charm, for the assurance of his anchored attachment.\r\n\r\nHer holiday took the burden of her trouble, and amid the beauty of a\r\ndisenchanted scene, she resumed the London incubus.\r\n\r\n‘You told him of her being at the Wells? in the neighbourhood, Victor?’\r\n\r\n‘Didn’t you know, my dear, the family-seat is Cronidge, two miles out\r\nfrom the Wells?--and particularly pretty country.’\r\n\r\n‘I had forgotten, if I ever heard. You will not let him be in\r\nignorance?’\r\n\r\n‘My dear love, you are pale about it. This is a matter between men. I\r\nwrite, thanking for the honour and so forth; and I appoint an interview;\r\nand I show him my tablets. He must be told, necessarily. Incidents of\r\nthis kind come in their turn. If Dudley does not account himself the\r\nluckiest young fellow in the kingdom, he’s not worthy of his good\r\nfortune. I wish they were both here now, honeymooning among these peaks,\r\nseeing the crescent over one, as we did last night!’\r\n\r\n‘Have you an idea, in reading Nesta’s letter?’\r\n\r\n‘Seems indifferent?--mere trick to hide the blushes. And I, too, I’m\r\ninterested in Delphica. Delphica and Falarique will be fine stage\r\nbusiness. Of course, Dr. Bouthoin and his curate!--we know what Old\r\nEngland has to expect from Colney.’\r\n\r\n‘At any rate, Mr. Durance hurts no one. You will, in your letter,\r\nappoint the day of the interview?’\r\n\r\n‘Hurts himself! Yes, dearest; appoint for--ten days homeward--eleventh\r\nday from to-day. And you to Fredi: a bit of description--as you can, my\r\nNataly! Happy to be a dolomite, to be painted by Nataly’s pen.’\r\n\r\nThe sign is evil, when we have a vexatious ringing in the ear of some\r\nsmall piece of familiar domestic chatter, and subject it to scrutiny,\r\nhang on it, worry and magnify it. What will not creatures under sway\r\nof the sensational life, catch at to emphasize and strengthen distaste,\r\nuntil distaste shall have a semblance of reason, in the period of the\r\nmind’s awakening to revolt! Nataly shrank from the name of dolomite,\r\ndetested the name, though the scenes regained their beauty or something\r\nof it beneath her showery vision. Every time Victor spoke of dolomites\r\non the journey homeward, she had at heart an accusation of her\r\ncowardice, her duplicity, frailty, treachery to the highest of her\r\nworship and sole support of her endurance in the world: not much blaming\r\nhim: but the degrading view of herself sank them both. On a shifty soil,\r\ndown goes the idol. For him she could plead still, for herself she could\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe smell of the Channel brine inspirited her sufficiently to cast off\r\nthe fit and make it seem, in the main, a bodily depression; owing to\r\ncauses, of which she was beginning to have an apprehensive knowledge:\r\nand they were not so fearful to her as the gloom they displaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. NATALY IN ACTION\r\n\r\nA ticket of herald newspapers told the world of Victor’s returning to\r\nhis London. Pretty Mrs. Blathenoy was Nataly’s first afternoon visitor,\r\nand was graciously received; no sign of inquiry for the cause of the\r\nlady’s alacrity to greet her being shown. Colney Durance came in,\r\nbringing the rumour of an Australian cantatrice to kindle Europe; Mr.\r\nPeridon, a seeker of tidings from the city of Bourges; Miss Priscilla\r\nGraves, reporting of Skepsey, in a holiday Sunday tone, that his\r\nalcoholic partner might at any moment release him; Mr. Septimus Barmby,\r\nwith a hanged heavy look, suggestive of a wharfside crane swinging the\r\nponderous thing he had to say. ‘I have seen Miss Radnor.’\r\n\r\n‘She was well?’ the mother asked, and the grand basso pitched forth an\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n‘Dear sweet girl she is!’ Mrs. Blathenoy exclaimed to Colney.\r\n\r\nHe bowed. ‘Very sweet. And can let fly on you, like a haggis, for a\r\nscratch.’\r\n\r\nShe laughed, glad of an escape from the conversational formalities\r\nimposed on her by this Mrs. Victor Radnor’s mighty manner. ‘But what\r\ngirl worth anything!...\r\n\r\nWe all can do that, I hope, for a scratch!’\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby’s Profession dissented.\r\n\r\nMr. Catkin appeared; ten minutes after his Peridon. He had met Victor\r\nnear the Exchange, and had left him humming the non fu sogno of ERNANI.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, when Victor takes to Verdi, it’s a flat City, and wants a burst of\r\ndrum and brass,’ Colney said; and he hummed a few bars of the march in\r\nAttila, and shrugged. He and Victor had once admired that blatancy.\r\n\r\nMr. Pempton appeared, according to anticipation. He sat himself beside\r\nPriscilla. Entered Mrs. John Cormyn, voluminous; Mrs. Peter Yatt,\r\neffervescent; Nataly’s own people were about her and she felt at home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy pushed a small thorn into it, by speaking of Captain\r\nFenellan, and aside, as if sharing him with her. Nataly heard that\r\nDartrey had been the guest of these Blathenoys. Even Dartrey was but a\r\nman!\r\n\r\nRather lower under her voice, the vain little creature asked: ‘You knew\r\nher?’\r\n\r\n‘Her?’\r\n\r\nThe cool counter-interrogation was disregarded. ‘So sad! In the desert!\r\na cup of pure water worth more than barrow-loads of gold! Poor woman!’\r\n\r\n‘Who?’\r\n\r\n‘His wife.’\r\n\r\n‘Wife!’\r\n\r\n‘They were married?’\r\n\r\nNataly could have cried: Snake! Her play at brevity had certainly been\r\nfoiled. She nodded gravely. A load of dusky wonders and speculations\r\npressed at her bosom. She disdained to question the mouth which had\r\nbitten her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy, resolving, that despite the jealousy she excited, she\r\nwould have her friend in Captain Fenellan, whom she liked--liked, she\r\nwas sure, quite as innocently as any other woman of his acquaintance\r\ndid, departed and she hugged her innocence defiantly, with the mournful\r\npride which will sometimes act as a solvent.\r\n\r\nA remark or two passed among the company upon her pretty face.\r\n\r\nNataly murmured to Colney: ‘Is there anything of Dartrey’s wife?’\r\n\r\n‘Dead,’ he answered.\r\n\r\n‘When?’\r\n\r\n‘Months back. I had it from Simeon. You didn’t hear?’\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. Her ears buzzed. If he had it from Simeon Fenellan,\r\nVictor must have known it.\r\n\r\nHer duties of hostess were conducted with the official smile.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she stood alone, she dropped on a chair, like one who has\r\ntaken a shot in the heart, and that hideous tumult of wild cries at her\r\nears blankly ceased. Dartrey, Victor, Nesta, were shifting figures of\r\nthe might-have-been for whom a wretched erring woman, washed clean of\r\nher guilt by death, in a far land, had gone to her end: vainly gone: and\r\nnow another was here, a figure of wood, in man’s shape, conjured up by\r\none of the three, to divide the two others; likely to be fatal to her\r\nor to them: to her, she hoped, if the choice was to be: and beneath the\r\nleaden hope, her heart set to a rapid beating, a fainter, a chill at the\r\ncore.\r\n\r\nShe snatched for breath. She shut her eyes, and with open lips, lay\r\nwaiting; prepared to thank the kindness about to hurry her hence, out of\r\nthe seas of pain, without pain.\r\n\r\nThen came sighs. The sad old servant in her bosom was resuming his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nBut she had been near it--very near it? A gush of pity for Victor,\r\noverwhelmed her hardness of mind.\r\n\r\nUnreflectingly, she tried her feet to support her, and tottered to\r\nthe door, touched along to the stairs, and descended them, thinking\r\nstrangely upon such a sudden weakness of body, when she would no longer\r\nhave thought herself the weak woman. Her aim was to reach the library.\r\nShe sat on the stairs midway, pondering over the length of her\r\njourney: and now her head was clearer; for she was travelling to get\r\nRailway-guides, and might have had them from the hands of a footman, and\r\nimagined that she had considered it prudent to hide her investigation of\r\nthose books: proofs of an understanding fallen backward to the state of\r\ninfant and having to begin our drear ascent again.\r\n\r\nA slam of the kitchen stair-door restored her. She betrayed no infirmity\r\nof footing as she walked past Arlington in the hall; and she was alive\r\nto the voice of Skepsey presently on the door-steps. Arlington brought\r\nher a note.\r\n\r\nVictor had written: ‘My love, I dine with Blathenoy in the City, at the\r\nWalworth. Business. Skepsey for clothes. Eight of us. Formal. A thousand\r\nembraces. Late.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey was ushered in. His wife had expired at noon, he said; and he\r\npostured decorously the grief he could not feel, knowing that a lady\r\nwould expect it of him. His wife had fallen down stone steps; she died\r\nin hospital. He wished to say, she was no loss to the country; but\r\nhe was advised within of the prudence of abstaining from comment\r\nand trusting to his posture, and he squeezed a drop of conventional\r\nsensibility out of it, and felt improved.\r\n\r\nNataly sent a line to Victor: ‘Dearest, I go to bed early, am tired.\r\nDine well. Come to me in the morning.’\r\n\r\nShe reproached herself for coldness to poor Skepsey, when he had gone.\r\nThe prospect of her being alone until the morning had been so absorbing\r\na relief.\r\n\r\nShe found a relief also in work at the book of the trains. A walk to\r\nthe telegraph-station strengthened her. Especially after despatching\r\na telegram to Mr. Dudley Sowerby at Cronidge, and one to Nesta at\r\nMoorsedge, did she become stoutly nerved. The former was requested to\r\nmeet her at Penhurst station at noon. Nesta was to be at the station for\r\nthe Wells at three o’clock.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the flying of these telegrams, up to the tap of\r\nVictor’s knuckle on her bed-room door next morning, she was not more\r\nreflectively conscious than a packet travelling to its destination by\r\npneumatic tube. Nor was she acutely impressionable to the features and\r\nthe voice she loved.\r\n\r\n‘You know of Skepsey?’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, poor Skepsey!’ Victor frowned and heaved.\r\n\r\n‘One of us ought to stand beside him at the funeral.’\r\n\r\n‘Colney or Fenellan?’\r\n\r\n‘I will ask Mr. Durance.’\r\n\r\n‘Do, my darling.’\r\n\r\n‘Victor, you did not tell me of Dartrey’s wife.’\r\n\r\n‘There again! They all get released! Yes, Dartrey! Dartrey has his luck\r\ntoo.’\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, with the desire to be asleep.\r\n\r\n‘You should have told me, dear.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, my love! Well--poor Dartrey! I fancy I hadn’t a confirmation of\r\nthe news. I remember a horrible fit of envy on hearing the hint: not\r\nmuch more than a hint: serious illness, was it?--or expected event.\r\nHardly worth while to trouble my dear soul, till certain. Anything about\r\nwives, forces me to think of myself--my better self!’\r\n\r\n‘I had to hear of it first from Mrs. Blathenoy.’\r\n\r\n‘You’ve heard of duels in dark rooms:--that was the case between\r\nBlathenoy and me last night for an hour.’\r\n\r\nShe feigned somnolent fatigue over her feverish weariness of heart. He\r\nkissed her on the forehead.\r\n\r\nHer spell-bound intention to speak of Dudley Sowerby to him, was broken\r\nby the sounding of the hall-door, thirty minutes later. She had lain in\r\na trance.\r\n\r\nLife surged to her with the thought, that she could decide and take\r\nher step. Many were the years back since she had taken a step; less\r\nindependently then than now; unregretted, if fatal. Her brain was heated\r\nfor the larger view of things and the swifter summing of them. It could\r\nput the man at a remove from her and say, that she had lived with him\r\nand suffered intensely. It gathered him to her breast rejoicing in their\r\nunion: the sharper the scourge, the keener the exultation. But she had\r\none reproach to deafen and beat down. This did not come on her from the\r\nworld: she and the world were too much foot to foot on the antagonist’s\r\nline, for her to listen humbly. It came of her quick summary survey of\r\nhim, which was unnoticed by the woman’s present fiery mind as being\r\nnew or strange in any way: simply it was a fact she now read; and\r\nit directed her to reproach herself for an abasement beneath his\r\nleadership, a blind subserviency and surrender of her faculties to his\r\ngreater powers, such as no soul of a breathing body should yield to man:\r\nnot to the highest, not to the Titan, not to the most Godlike of men.\r\nUnder cloak, they demand it. They demand their bane.\r\n\r\nAnd Victor!... She had seen into him.\r\n\r\nThe reproach on her was, that she, in her worship, had been slave, not\r\nhelper. Scarcely was she irreproachable in the character of slave. If it\r\nhad been utter slave! she phrased the words, for a further reproach. She\r\nremembered having at times murmured, dissented. And it would have been\r\na desperate proud thought to comfort a slave, that never once had she\r\nknown even a secret opposition to the will of her lord.\r\n\r\nBut she had: she recalled instances. Up they rose; up rose everything\r\nher mind ranged over, subsiding immediately when the service was done.\r\nShe had not conceived her beloved to be infallible, surest of guides in\r\nall earthly-matters. Her intellect had sometimes protested.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had moved her to swamp it?\r\n\r\nHer heart answered. And that heart also was arraigned: and the heart’s\r\nfleshly habitation acting on it besides: so flagellant of herself was\r\nshe: covertly, however, and as the chaste among women can consent to let\r\nour animal face them. Not grossly, still perceptibly to her penetrative\r\nhard eye on herself, she saw the senses of the woman under a charm. She\r\nsaw, and swam whirling with a pang of revolt from her personal being and\r\nthis mortal kind.\r\n\r\nHer rational intelligence righted her speedily. She could say in truth,\r\nby proof, she loved the man: nature’s love, heart’s love, soul’s love.\r\nShe had given him her life.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy cross-current recollection, that the very beginning and\r\nspring of this wild cast of her life, issued from something he said and\r\ndid (merest of airy gestures) to signify the blessing of life--how good\r\nand fair it is. A drooping mood in her had been struck; he had a look\r\nlike the winged lyric up in blue heavens: he raised the head of the\r\nyoung flower from its contemplation of grave-mould. That was when he\r\nhad much to bear: Mrs. Burman present: and when the stranger in their\r\nhousehold had begun to pity him and have a dread of her feelings. The\r\nlucent splendour of his eyes was memorable, a light above the rolling\r\noceans of Time.\r\n\r\nShe had given him her life, little aid. She might have closely\r\ncounselled, wound in and out with his ideas. Sensible of capacity, she\r\nconfessed to the having been morally subdued, physically as well; swept\r\nonward; and she was arrested now by an accident, like a waif of the\r\nriver-floods by the dip of a branch. Time that it should be! But was not\r\nMr. Durance, inveighing against the favoured system for the education of\r\nwomen, right when he declared them to be unfitted to speak an opinion\r\non any matter external to the household or in a crisis of the household?\r\nShe had not agreed with him: he presented stinging sentences, which\r\nirritated more than they enlightened. Now it seemed to her, that the\r\nmodel women of men make pleasant slaves, not true mates: they lack the\r\nworldly training to know themselves or take a grasp of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere is an exotic fostering of the senses for women, not the\r\nstrengthening breath of vital common air. If good fortune is with them,\r\nall may go well: the stake of their fates is upon the perpetual smooth\r\nflow of good fortune. She had never joined to the cry of the women. Few\r\namong them were having it in the breast as loudly.\r\n\r\nHard on herself, too, she perceived how the social rebel had reduced\r\nher mind to propitiate a simulacrum, reflected from out, of an enthroned\r\nSociety within it, by an advocacy of the existing laws and rules\r\nand habits. Eminently servile is the tolerated lawbreaker: none so\r\nconservative. Not until we are driven back upon an unviolated Nature, do\r\nwe call to the intellect to think radically: and then we begin to think\r\nof our fellows.\r\n\r\nOr when we have set ourselves in motion direct for the doing of the\r\nright thing: have quitted the carriage at the station, and secured the\r\nticket, and entered the train, counting the passage of time for a simple\r\nrapid hour before we have eased heart in doing justice to ourself and to\r\nanother; then likewise the mind is lighted for radiation. That doing of\r\nthe right thing, after a term of paralysis, cowardice--any evil name--is\r\none of the mighty reliefs, equal to happiness, of longer duration.\r\n\r\nNataly had it. But her mind was actually radiating, and the comfort\r\nto her heart evoked the image of Dartrey Fenellan. She saw a possible\r\nreason for her bluntness to the coming scene with Dudley.\r\n\r\nAt once she said, No! and closed the curtain; knowing what was behind,\r\ncounting it nought. She repeated almost honestly her positive negative.\r\nHow we are mixed of the many elements! she thought, as an observer; and\r\nself-justifyingly thought on, and with truth, that duty urged her upon\r\nthis journey; and proudly thought, that she had not a shock of the\r\npainful great organ in her breast at the prospect at the end, or any\r\napprehension of its failure to carry her through.\r\n\r\nYet the need of peace or some solace needed to prepare her for her\r\ninterview turned her imagination burningly on Dartrey. She would not\r\nallow herself to meditate over hopes and schemes:--Nesta free: Dartrey\r\nfree. She vowed to her soul sacredly--and she was one of those in whom\r\nthe Divinity lives, that they may do so--not to speak a word for the\r\ninfluencing of Dudley save the one fact. Consequently, for a personal\r\nindulgence, she mused; she caressed maternally the object of her musing;\r\nof necessity, she excluded Nesta; but in tenderness she gave Dartrey a\r\nfair one to love him.\r\n\r\nThe scene was waved away. That one so loving him, partly worthy of him,\r\nready to traverse the world now beside him--who could it be other than\r\nshe who knew and prized his worth? Foolish! It is one of the hatefuller\r\nscourges upon women whenever, a little shaken themselves, they muse upon\r\nsome man’s image, that they cannot put in motion the least bit of drama\r\nwithout letting feminine self play a part; generally to develop into a\r\nprincipal part... The apology makes it a melancholy part.\r\n\r\nDartrey’s temper of the caged lion dominated by his tamer, served as\r\nkeynote for any amount of saddest colouring. He controlled the brute:\r\nbut he held the contempt of danger, the love of strife, the passion for\r\nadventure; he had crossed the desert of human anguish. He of all men\r\nrequired a devoted mate, merited her. Of all men living, he was the\r\nhardest to match with a woman--with a woman deserving him.\r\n\r\nThe train had quitted London. Now for the country, now for free\r\nbreathing! She who two days back had come from Alps, delighted in the\r\nlook on flat green fields. It was under the hallucination of her saying\r\nin flight adieu to them, and to England; and, that somewhere hidden, to\r\nbe found in Asia, Africa, America, was the man whose ideal of life was\r\nhigher than enjoyment. His caged brute of a temper offered opportunities\r\nfor delicious petting; the sweetest a woman can bestow: it lifts her\r\nout of timidity into an adoration still palpitatingly fearful. Ah, but\r\nfamiliarity, knowledge, confirmed assurance of his character, lift her\r\nto another stage, above the pleasures. May she not prove to him how\r\nreally matched with him she is, to disdain the pleasures, cheerfully\r\naccept the burdens, meet death, if need be; readily face it as the\r\nquietly grey to-morrow: at least, show herself to her hero for a\r\nwoman--the incredible being to most men--who treads the terrors as well\r\nas the pleasures of humanity beneath her feet, and may therefore have\r\nsome pride in her stature. Ay, but only to feel the pride of standing\r\nnot so shamefully below his level beside him.\r\n\r\nWoods were flying past the carriage-windows. Her solitary companion\r\nwas of the class of the admiring gentlemen. Presently he spoke. She\r\nanswered. He spoke again. Her mouth smiled, and her accompanying look of\r\nabstract benevolence arrested the tentative allurement to conversation.\r\n\r\nNew ideas were set revolving in her. Dartrey and Victor grew to\r\na likeness; they became hazily one man, and the mingled phantom\r\ncomplimented her on her preserving a good share of the beauty of her\r\nyouth. The face perhaps: the figure rather too well suits the years! she\r\nreplied. To reassure her, this Dartrey-Victor drew her close and kissed\r\nher; and she was confused and passed into the breast of Mrs. Burman\r\nexpecting an operation at the hands of the surgeons. The train had\r\nstopped. ‘Penhurst?’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Penhurst is the next station,’ said the gentleman. Here was a theme for\r\nhim! The stately mansion, the noble grounds, and Sidney! He discoursed\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe handsome lady appeared interested. She was interested also by his\r\ndescription of a neighbouring village, likely one hundred years hence\r\nto be a place of pilgrimage for Americans and for Australians. Age, he\r\nsaid, improves true beauty; and his eyelids indicated a levelling to\r\nperform the soft intentness. Mechanically, a ball rose in her throat;\r\nthe remark was illuminated by a saying of Colney’s, with regard to his\r\ncountrymen at the play of courtship. No laughter came. The gentleman\r\ntalked on.\r\n\r\nAll fancies and internal communications left her. Slowness of motion\r\nbrought her to the plain piece of work she had to do, on a colourless\r\nearth, that seemed foggy; but one could see one’s way. Resolution is a\r\nform of light, our native light in this dubious world.\r\n\r\nDudley Sowerby opened her carriage-door. They greeted.\r\n\r\n‘You have seen Nesta?’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Not for two days. You have not heard? The Miss Duvidneys have gone to\r\nBrighton.’\r\n\r\n‘They are rather in advance of the Season.’\r\n\r\nShe thanked him for meeting her. He was grateful for the summons.\r\n\r\nInforming the mother of his betrothed, that he had ridden over from\r\nCronidge, he speculated on the place to select for her luncheon, and\r\nhe spoke of his horse being led up and down outside the station. Nataly\r\ninquired for the hour of the next train to London. He called to one of\r\nthe porters, obtained and imparted the time; evidently now, as shown by\r\nan unevenness of his lifted brows, expecting news of some little weight.\r\n\r\n‘Your husband is quite well?’ he said, in affection for the name of\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Radnor is well; I have to speak to you; I have more than time.’\r\n\r\n‘You will lunch at the inn?’\r\n\r\n‘I shall not eat. We will walk.’\r\n\r\nThey crossed the road and passed under trees.\r\n\r\n‘My mother was to have called on the Miss Duvidneys. They left\r\nhurriedly; I think it was unanticipated by Nesta. I venture... you\r\npardon the liberty... she allows me to entertain hopes. Mr. Radnor, I am\r\nhardly too bold in thinking... I trust, in appealing to you... at least\r\nI can promise!\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Sowerby, you have done my daughter the honour to ask her hand in\r\nmarriage.’\r\n\r\nHe said: ‘I have,’ and had much to say besides, but deferred: a blow was\r\nvisible. The father had been more encouraging to him than the mother.\r\n\r\n‘You have not known of any circumstance that might cause hesitation in\r\nasking?’\r\n\r\n‘Miss Radnor?’\r\n\r\n‘My daughter:--you have to think of your family.’\r\n\r\n‘Indeed, Mrs. Radnor, I was coming to London tomorrow, with the consent\r\nof my family.’\r\n\r\n‘You address me as Mrs. Radnor. I have not the legal right to the name.’\r\n\r\n‘Not legal!’ said he, with a catch at the word.\r\n\r\nHe spun round in her sight, though his demeanour was manfully rigid.\r\n\r\n‘Have I understood, madam...?’\r\n\r\n‘You would not request me to repeat it. Is that your horse the man is\r\nleading?’\r\n\r\n‘My horse: it must be my horse.’\r\n\r\n‘Mount and ride back. Leave me: I shall not eat. Reflect, by yourself.\r\nYou are in a position of one who is not allowed to decide by his\r\nfeelings. Mr. Radnor you know where to find.’\r\n\r\n‘But surely, some food? I cannot have misapprehended?’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot eat. I think you have understood me clearly.’\r\n\r\n‘You wish me to go?’\r\n\r\n‘I beg.’\r\n\r\n‘It pains me, dear madam.’\r\n\r\n‘It relieves me, if you will. Here is your horse.’\r\n\r\nShe gave her hand. He touched it and bent. He looked at her. A surge\r\nof impossible questions rolled to his mouth and rolled back, with the\r\nthought of an incredible thing, that her manner, more than her words,\r\nheld him from doubting.\r\n\r\n‘I obey you,’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘You are kind.’\r\n\r\nHe mounted horse, raised hat, paced on, and again bowing, to one of the\r\nwayside trees, cantered. The man was gone; but not from Nataly’s vision\r\nthat face of wet chalk under one of the shades of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. IN WHICH WE SEE A CONVENTIONAL GENTLEMAN ENDEAVOURING TO\r\nEXAMINE A SPECTRE OF HIMSELF\r\n\r\nDudley rode back to Cronidge with his thunderstroke. It filled him, as\r\nin those halls of political clamour, where explanatory speech is not\r\naccepted, because of a drowning tide of hot blood on both sides. He\r\nsought to win attention by submitting a resolution, to the effect, that\r\nhe would the next morning enter into the presence of Mr. Victor Radnor,\r\nbearing his family’s feelings, for a discussion upon them. But the\r\nbrutish tumult, in addition to surcharging, encased him: he could not\r\nrightly conceive the nature of feelings: men were driving shoals; he had\r\nlost hearing and touch of individual men; had become a house of angrily\r\nopposing parties.\r\n\r\nHe was hurt, he knew; and therefore he supposed himself injured, though\r\nthere were contrary outcries, and he admitted that he stood free; he had\r\nnot been inextricably deceived.\r\n\r\nThe girl was caught away to the thinnest of wisps in a dust-whirl.\r\nReverting to the father and mother, his idea of a positive injury, that\r\nwas not without its congratulations, sank him down among his disordered\r\ndeeper sentiments; which were a diver’s wreck, where an armoured livid\r\nsubtermarine, a monstrous puff-ball of man, wandered seriously light in\r\nheaviness; trembling his hundredweights to keep him from dancing like\r\na bladder-block of elastic lumber; thinking occasionally, amid the\r\nmournful spectacle, of the atmospheric pipe of communication with the\r\nworld above, whereby he was deafened yet sustained. One tug at it, and\r\nhe was up on the surface, disengaged from the hideous harness, joyfully\r\nno more that burly phantom cleaving green slime, free! and the roaring\r\nstopped; the world looked flat, foreign, a place of crusty promise.\r\nHis wreck, animated by the dim strange fish below, appeared fairer; it\r\nwinked lurefully when abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe internal state of a gentleman who detested intangible metaphor as\r\nheartily as the vulgarest of our gobblegobbets hate it, metaphor only\r\ncan describe; and for the reason, that he had in him just something\r\nmore than is within the compass of the language of the meat-markets.\r\nHe had--and had it not the less because he fain would not have\r\nhad--sufficient stuff to furnish forth a soul’s epic encounter between\r\nNature and Circumstance: and metaphor, simile, analysis, all the\r\nfraternity of old lamps for lighting our abysmal darkness, have to be\r\nrubbed, that we may get a glimpse of the fray.\r\n\r\nFree, and rejoicing; without the wish to be free; at the same time\r\nhumbly and sadly acquiescing in the stronger claim of his family\r\nto pronounce the decision: such was the second stage of Dudley’s\r\nperturbation after the blow. A letter of Nesta’s writing was in his\r\npocket: he knew her address. He could not reply to her until he had seen\r\nher father: and that interview remained necessarily prospective until he\r\nhad come to his exact resolve, not omitting his critical approval of the\r\nsentences giving it shape, stamp, dignity--a noble’s crest, as it were.\r\n\r\nNesta wrote briefly. The apostrophe was, ‘Dear Mr. Sowerby.’ She\r\nhad engaged to send her address. Her father had just gone. The Miss\r\nDuvidneys had left the hotel yesterday for the furnished house facing\r\nthe sea. According to arrangements, she had a livery-stable hack, and\r\nhad that morning trotted out to the downs with a riding-master and\r\ncompany, one of whom was ‘an agreeable lady.’\r\n\r\nHe noticed approvingly her avoidance of an allusion to the ‘Delphica’ of\r\nMr. Durance’s incomprehensible serial story, or whatever it was; which,\r\nas he had shown her, annoyed him, for its being neither fact nor fun;\r\nand she had insisted on the fun; and he had painfully tried to see it\r\nor anything of a meaning; and it seemed to him now, that he had been\r\nhumiliated by the obedience to her lead: she had offended by her harping\r\nupon Delphica. However, here it was unmentioned. He held the letter out\r\nto seize it in the large, entire.\r\n\r\nHer handwriting was good, as good as the writing of the most agreeable\r\nlady on earth. Dudley did not blame her for letting the lady be deceived\r\nin her--if she knew her position. She might be ignorant of it. And to\r\nstrangers, to chance acquaintances, even to friends, the position, of\r\nthe loathsome name, was not materially important. Marriage altered the\r\nview. He sided with his family.\r\n\r\nHe sided, edgeing away, against his family. But a vision of the earldom\r\ncoming to him, stirred reverential objections, composed of all which\r\nhis unstained family could protest in religion, to repudiate an alliance\r\nwith a stained house, and the guilty of a condonation of immorality. Who\r\nwould have imagined Mr. Radnor a private sinner flaunting for one of the\r\nrighteous? And she, the mother, a lady--quite a lady; having really\r\na sense of duty, sense of honour! That she must be a lady, Dudley\r\nwas convinced. He beheld through a porous crape, woven of formal\r\nrespectfulness, with threads of personal disgust, the scene, striking\r\nhim drearly like a distant great mansion’s conflagration across moorland\r\nat midnight, of a lady’s breach of bonds and plunge of all for love. How\r\nhad it been concealed? In Dudley’s upper sphere, everything was exposed:\r\nScandal walked naked and unashamed-figurante of the polite world. But\r\nstill this lady was of the mint and coin, a true lady. Handsome now,\r\nshe must have been beautiful. And a comprehensible pride (for so would\r\nDudley have borne it) keeps the forsaken man silent up to death:...\r\ngrandly silent; but the loss of such a woman is enough to kill a man!\r\nNot in time, though! Legitimacy evidently, by the mother’s confession,\r\ncannot protect where it is wanted. Dudley was optically affected by a\r\nround spot of the world swinging its shadow over Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe pitied, and strove to be sensible of her. The effort succeeded so\r\nwell, that he was presently striving to be insensible. The former state,\r\nwas the mounting of a wall; the latter, was a sinking through a chasm.\r\nThere would be family consultations, abhorrent; his father’s agonized\r\namazement at the problem presented to a family of scrupulous principles\r\nand pecuniary requirements; his mother’s blunt mention of the abominable\r\nname--mediaevally vindicated in champions of certain princely families\r\nindeed, but morally condemned; always under condemnation of the Church:\r\na blot: and handed down: Posterity, and it might be a titled posterity,\r\ncrying out. A man in the situation of Dudley could not think solely of\r\nhimself. The nobles of the land are bound in honour to their posterity.\r\nThere you have one of the prominent permanent distinctions between them\r\nand the commonalty.\r\n\r\nHis mother would again propose her chosen bride for him: Edith Averst,\r\nwith the dowry of a present one thousand pounds per annum, and prospect\r\nof six or so, excluding Sir John’s estate, Carping, in Leicestershire; a\r\nfair estate, likely to fall to Edith; consumption seized her brothers as\r\nthey ripened. A fair girl too; only Dudley did not love her; he wanted\r\nto love. He was learning the trick from this other one, who had become\r\nobscured and diminished, tainted, to the thought of her; yet not\r\nextinct. Sight of her was to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nUnguiltily tainted, in herself she was innocent. That constituted the\r\nunhappy invitation to him to swallow one half of his feelings, which\r\nhad his world’s blessing on it, for the beneficial enlargement and\r\nenthronement of the baser unblest half, which he hugged and distrusted.\r\nCan innocence issue of the guilty? He asked it, hopeing it might be\r\npossible: he had been educated in his family to believe, that the laws\r\ngoverning human institutions are divine--until History has altered them.\r\nThey are altered, to present a fresh bulwark against the infidel. His\r\nconservative mind, retiring in good order, occupied the next rearward\r\npost of resistance. Secretly behind it, the man was proud of having\r\na heart to beat for the cause of the besiegeing enemy, in the present\r\ninstance. When this was blabbed to him, and he had owned it, he\r\nattributed his weakness to excess of nature, the liking for a fair\r\nface.--Oh, but more! spirit was in the sweet eyes. She led him--she did\r\nlead him in spiritual things; led him out of common circles of thought,\r\ninto refreshing new spheres; he had reminiscences of his having relished\r\nthe juices of the not quite obviously comic, through her indications:\r\nand really, in spite of her inferior flimsy girl’s education, she could\r\nboast her acquirements; she was quick, startlingly; modest, too, in\r\ncommerce with a slower mind that carried more; though she laughed\r\nand was a needle for humour: she taught him at times to put away his\r\ncontempt of the romantic; she had actually shown him, that his expressed\r\ncontempt of it disguised a dread: as it did, and he was conscious of the\r\nfoolishness of it now while pursuing her image, while his intelligence\r\nand senses gave her the form and glory of young morning.\r\n\r\nWariness counselled him to think it might be merely the play of her\r\nyouth; and also the disposition of a man in harness of business,\r\nexaggeratingly to prize an imagined finding of the complementary\r\nfeminine of himself. Venerating purity as he did, the question, whether\r\nthe very sweetest of pure young women, having such an origin, must not\r\nat some time or other show trace of the origin, surged up. If he could\r\nonly have been sure of her moral exemption from taint, a generous\r\nardour, in reserve behind his anxious dubieties, would have precipitated\r\nDudley to quench disapprobation and brave the world under a buckler of\r\nthose monetary advantages, which he had but stoutly to plead with the\r\nHouse of Cantor, for the speedy overcoming of a reluctance to receive\r\nthe nameless girl and prodigious heiress. His family’s instruction of\r\nhim, and his inherited tastes, rendered the aspect of a Nature stripped\r\nof the clothing of the laws offensive down to devilish: we grant her\r\ncertain steps, upon certain conditions accompanied by ceremonies; and\r\nwhen she violates them, she becomes visibly again the revolutionary\r\nwicked old beast bent on levelling our sacredest edifices. An alliance\r\nwith any of her votaries, appeared to Dudley as an act of treason to his\r\nhouse, his class, and his tenets. And nevertheless he was haunted by a\r\ncry of criminal happiness for and at the commission of the act.\r\n\r\nHe would not decide to be ‘precipitate,’ and the days ran their course,\r\nuntil Lady Grace Halley arrived at Cronidge, a widow. Lady Cantor spoke\r\nto her of Dudley’s unfathomable gloom. Lady Grace took him aside.\r\n\r\nShe said, without preface: ‘You’ve heard, have you!’\r\n\r\n‘You were aware of it?’ said he, and his tone was irritable with a\r\nrebuke.\r\n\r\n‘Coming through town, for the first time yesterday. I had it--of all\r\nmen!--from a Sir Abraham Quatley, to whom I was recommended to go, about\r\nmy husband’s shares in a South American Railway; and we talked, and it\r\ncame out. He knows; he says, it is not generally known; and he likes,\r\nrespects Mr. Victor Radnor; we are to keep the secret. Hum? He had heard\r\nof your pretensions; and our relationship, etc.: “esteemed” it--you know\r\nthe City dialect--his duty to mention, etc. That was after I had spied\r\non his forehead the something I wormed out of his mouth. What are you\r\ngoing to do?’\r\n\r\n‘What can I do!’\r\n\r\n‘Are you fond of the girl?’\r\n\r\nAn attachment was indicated, as belonging to the case. She was not a\r\nwoman to whom the breathing of pastoral passion would be suitable; yet\r\nhe saw that she despised him for a lover; and still she professed to\r\nunderstand his dilemma. Perplexity at the injustice of fate and persons\r\nuniversally, put a wrinkled mask on his features and the expression\r\nof his feelings. They were torn, and the world was torn; and what he\r\nwanted, was delay, time for him to define his feelings and behold a\r\nrecomposed picture of the world. He had already taken six days. He\r\npleaded the shock to his family.\r\n\r\n‘You won’t have such a chance again,’ she said. Shrugs had set in.\r\n\r\nThey agreed as to the behaviour of the girl’s mother. It reflected on\r\nthe father, he thought.\r\n\r\n‘Difficult thing to proclaim, before an engagement!’ Her shoulders were\r\nrestless.\r\n\r\n‘When a man’s feelings get entangled!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! a man’s feelings! I’m your British Jury for, a woman’s.’\r\n\r\n‘He has married her?’\r\n\r\nShe declared to not knowing particulars. She could fib smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe next day she was on the line to London, armed with the proposal of\r\nan appointment for the Hon. Dudley to meet ‘the girl’s father.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. CONTAINS WHAT IS A SMALL THING OR A GREAT, AS THE SOUL OF\r\nTHE CHIEF ACTOR MAY DECIDE\r\n\r\nSkepsey ushered Lady Grace into his master’s private room, and\r\nentertained her during his master’s absence. He had buried his wife,\r\nhe said: she feared, seeing his posture of the soaping of hands at one\r\nshoulder, that he was about to bewail it; and he did wish to talk of it,\r\nto show his modest companionship with her in loss, and how a consolation\r\nfor our sorrows may be obtained: but he won her approval, by taking\r\nthe acceptable course between the dues to the subject and those to his\r\nhearer, as a model cab should drive considerate equally of horse and\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nA day of holiday at Hampstead, after the lowering of the poor woman’s\r\nbones into earth, had been followed by a descent upon London; and at\r\nnight he had found himself in the immediate neighbourhood of a public\r\nhouse, noted for sparring exhibitions and instructions on the first\r\nfloor; and he was melancholy, unable quite to disperse ‘the ravens’\r\nflocking to us on such days: though, if we ask why we have to go out of\r\nthe world, there is a corresponding inquiry, of what good was our coming\r\ninto it; and unless we are doing good work for our country, the answer\r\nis not satisfactory--except, that we are as well gone. Thinking which,\r\nhe was accosted by a young woman: perfectly respectable, in every way:\r\nwho inquired if he had seen a young man enter the door. She described\r\nhim, and reviled the temptations of those houses; and ultimately, as she\r\ninsisted upon going in to look for the young man and use her persuasions\r\nto withdraw him from ‘that snare of Satan,’ he had accompanied her, and\r\nhe had gone upstairs and brought the young man down. But friends, or\r\nthe acquaintances they call friends, were with him, and they were ‘in\r\ndrink,’ and abused the young woman; and she had her hand on the young\r\nman’s arm, quoting Scripture. Sad to relate of men bearing the name\r\nof Englishmen--and it was hardly much better if they pleaded\r\nintoxication!--they were not content to tear the young man from her\r\ngrasp, they hustled her, pushed her out, dragged her in the street.\r\n\r\n‘It became me to step to her defence: she was meek,’ said Skepsey. ‘She\r\nhad a great opinion of the efficacy of quotations from Scripture; she\r\ndid not recriminate. I was able to release her and the young man she\r\nprotected, on condition of my going upstairs to give a display of my\r\nproficiency. I had assured them, that the poor fellows who stood against\r\nme were not a proper match. And of course, they jeered, but they had\r\nthe evidence, on the pavement. So I went up with them. I was heavily\r\noppressed, I wanted relief, I put on the gloves. He was a bigger\r\nman; they laughed at the little one. I told them, it depended upon a\r\nknowledge of first principles, and the power to apply them. I will not\r\nboast, my lady: my junior by ten years, the man went down; he went down\r\na second time; and the men seemed surprised; I told them, it was nothing\r\nbut first principles put into action. I mention the incident, for the\r\nextreme relief it afforded me at the close of a dark day.’\r\n\r\n‘So you cured your grief!’ said Lady Grace; and Skepsey made way for his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nVictor’s festival-lights were kindled, beholding her; cressets on the\r\nwindow-sill, lamps inside.\r\n\r\n‘Am I so welcome?’ There was a pull of emotion at her smile. ‘What with\r\nyour little factotum and you, we are flattered to perdition when we come\r\nhere. He has been proposing, by suggestion, like a Court-physician,\r\nthe putting on of his boxing-gloves, for the consolation of the\r\nwidowed:--meant most kindly! and it’s a thousand pities women haven’t\r\ntheir padded gloves.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! but our boxing-gloves can do mischief enough. You have something to\r\nsay, I see.’\r\n\r\n‘How do you see?’\r\n\r\n‘Tusk, tush.’\r\n\r\nThe silly ring of her voice and the pathless tattle changed; she talked\r\nto suit her laden look. ‘You hit it. I come from Dudley. He knows the\r\nfacts. I wish to serve you, in every way.’\r\n\r\nVictor’s head had lifted.\r\n\r\n‘Who was it?’\r\n\r\n‘No enemy.’\r\n\r\n‘Her mother. She did rightly!\r\n\r\n‘Certainly she did,’ said Victor, and he thought that instantaneously of\r\nthe thing done. ‘Oh, then she spoke to him! She has kept it from me.\r\nFor now nearly a week--six days--I’ve seen her spying for something she\r\nexpected, like a face behind a door three inches ajar. She has not been\r\nhalf alive; she refused explanations;--she was expecting to hear from\r\nhim, of him:--the decision, whatever it’s to be!’\r\n\r\n‘I can’t aid you there,’ said Lady Grace. ‘He’s one of the unreadables.\r\nHe names Tuesday next week.’\r\n\r\n‘By all means.’\r\n\r\n‘She?’\r\n\r\n‘Fredi?--poor Fredi!--ah, my poor girl, yes!--No, she knows nothing.\r\nHere is the truth of it.--she, the legitimate, lives: they say she\r\nlives. Well, then, she lives against all rules physical or medical,\r\nlives by sheer force of will--it’s a miracle of the power of a human\r\ncreature to .... I have it from doctors, friends, attendants, they\r\ncan’t guess what she holds on, to keep her breath. All the happiness in\r\nlife!--if only it could benefit her. But it ‘s the cause of death to us.\r\nDo you see, dear friend;--you are a friend, proved friend,’ he took her\r\nhand, and held and pressed it, in great need of a sanguine response to\r\nemphasis; and having this warm feminine hand, his ideas ran off with\r\nit. ‘The friend I need! You have courage. My Nataly, poor dear--she can\r\nendure, in her quiet way. A woman of courage would take her place beside\r\nme and compel the world to do her homage, help;--a bright ready smile\r\ndoes it! She would never be beaten. Of course, we could have lived under\r\na bushel--stifled next to death! But I am for light, air-battle, if you\r\nlike. I want a comrade, not a--not that I complain. I respect, pity,\r\nlove--I do love her, honour: only, we want something else--courage--to\r\nface the enemy. Quite right, that she should speak to Dudley Sowerby. He\r\nhas to know, must know; all who deal closely with us must know. But see\r\na moment: I am waiting to see the impediment dispersed, which puts\r\nher at an inequality with the world: and then I speak to all whom it\r\nconcerns--not before: for her sake. How is it now? Dudley will ask...\r\nyou understand. And when I am forced to confess, that the mother,\r\nthe mother of the girl he seeks in marriage, is not yet in that state\r\nherself, probably at that very instant the obstacle has crumbled\r\nto dust! I say, probably: I have information--doctors, friends,\r\nattendants--they all declare it cannot last outside a week. But you are\r\nhere--true, I could swear! a touch of a hand tells me. A woman’s hand?\r\nWell, yes: I read by the touch of a woman’s hand:--betrays more than her\r\nlooks or her lips!’ He sank his voice. ‘I don’t talk of condoling: if\r\nyou are in grief, you know I share it.’ He kissed her hand, and laid it\r\non her lap; eyed it, and met her eyes; took a header into her eyes, and\r\nlost himself. A nip of his conscience moved his tongue to say: ‘As for\r\nguilt, if it were known... a couple of ascetics--absolutely!’ But this\r\nwas assumed to be unintelligible; and it was merely the apology to his\r\nconscience in communion with the sprite of a petticoated fair one who\r\nwas being subjected to tender little liberties, necessarily addressed\r\nin enigmas. He righted immediately, under a perception of the\r\nthoroughbred’s contempt for the barriers of wattled sheep; and caught\r\nthe word ‘guilt,’ to hide the Philistine citizen’s lapse, by relating\r\nhistorically, in abridgement, the honest beauty of the passionate loves\r\nof the two whom the world proscribed for honestly loving. There was no\r\nguilt. He harped on the word, to erase the recollection of his first use\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n‘Fiddle,’ said Lady Grace. ‘The thing happened. You have now to carry it\r\nthrough. You require a woman’s aid in a social matter. Rely on me, for\r\nwhat I can do. You will see Dudley on Tuesday? I will write. Be plain\r\nwith him; not forgetting the gilding, I need not remark. Your Nesta has\r\nno aversion?’\r\n\r\n‘Admires, respects, likes; is quite--is willing.’\r\n\r\n‘Good enough beginning.’ She rose, for the atmosphere was heated, rather\r\nheavy. ‘And if one proves to be of aid, you’ll own that a woman has her\r\nplace in the battle.’\r\n\r\nThe fair black-clad widow’s quick and singular interwreathing of the\r\nevanescent pretty pouts and frowns dimpled like the brush of the wind\r\non a sunny pool in a shady place; and her forehead was close below his\r\nchin, her lips not far. Her apparel was attractively mourning.\r\n\r\nWidows in mourning, when they do not lean over extremely to the Stygian\r\nshore, with the complexions of the drugs which expedited the defunct\r\nto the ferry, provoke the manly arm within reach of them to pluck their\r\npathetic blooming persons clean away from it. What of the widow who\r\nvisibly likes the living? Compassion; sympathy, impulse; and gratitude,\r\nimpulse again, living warmth; and a spring of the blood to wrestle\r\nwith the King of Terrors for the other poor harper’s half-night\r\ncapped Eurydice; and a thirst, sudden as it is overpowering; and the\r\nsolicitude, a reflective solicitude, to put the seal on a thing and call\r\nit a fact, to the astonishment of history; and a kick of our naughty\r\nyouth in its coffin; all the insurgencies of Nature, with her colonel of\r\nthe regiment absent, and her veering trick to drive two vessels at the\r\ncross of a track into collision, combine for doing that, which is very\r\nmuch more, and which affects us at times so much less than did the\r\npressure of a soft wedded hand by our own elsewhere pledged one. On\r\nthe contrary, we triumph, we have the rich flavour of the fruit for our\r\npains; we commission the historian to write in hieroglyphs a round big\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe lady passed through the trial submitting, stiffening her shoulders,\r\nand at the close, shutting her eyes. She stood cool in her blush, and\r\neyed him, like one gravely awakened. Having been embraced and kissed,\r\nshe had to consider her taste for the man, and acknowledge a neatness\r\nof impetuosity in the deed; and he was neither apologizing culprit\r\nnor glorying-bandit when it was done, but something of the lyric God\r\ntempering his fervours to a pleased sereneness, not offering a renewal\r\nof them. He glowed transparently. He said: ‘You are the woman to take\r\na front place in the battle!’ With this woman beside him, it was a\r\nconquered world.\r\n\r\nComparisons, in the jotting souvenirs of a woman of her class and set,\r\nfavoured him; for she disliked enterprising libertines and despised\r\nstumbling youths; and the genial simple glow of his look assured her,\r\nthat the vanished fiery moment would not be built on by a dating master.\r\nShe owned herself. Or did she? Some understanding of how the other woman\r\nhad been won to the leap with him, was drawing in about her. She would\r\nhave liked to beg for the story; and she could as little do that as\r\nbring her tongue to reproach. If we come to the den! she said to her\r\nthought of reproach. Our semi-civilization makes it a den, where a scent\r\nin his nostrils will spring the half-tamed animal away to wildness. And\r\nshe had come unanticipatingly, without design, except perhaps to get a\r\nsuperior being to direct and restrain a gambler’s hand perhaps for the\r\nfee of a temporary pressure.\r\n\r\n‘I may be able to help a little--I hope!’ she fetched a breath to say,\r\nwhile her eyelids mildly sermonized; and immediately she talked of her\r\ninheritance of property in stocks and shares.\r\n\r\nVictor commented passingly on the soundness of them, and talked of\r\nprojects he entertained:--Parliament! ‘But I have only to mention it at\r\nhome, and my poor girl will set in for shrinking.’\r\n\r\nHe doated on the diverse aspect of the gallant woman of the world.\r\n\r\n‘You succeed in everything you do,’ said she, and she cordially believed\r\nit; and that belief set the neighbour memory palpitating. Success folded\r\nher waist, was warm upon her lips: she worshipped the figure of Success.\r\n\r\n‘I can’t consent to fail, it’s true, when my mind is on a thing,’ Victor\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\nHe looked his mind on Lady Grace. The shiver of a maid went over her.\r\nThese transparent visages, where the thought which is half design is\r\nperceived as a lightning, strike lightning into the physically feebler.\r\nHer hand begged, with the open palm, her head shook thrice; and though\r\nshe did not step back, he bowed to the negation, and then she gave him\r\na grateful shadow of a smile, relieved, with a startled view of how\r\ngreatly relieved, by that sympathetic deference in the wake of the\r\ncapturing intrepidity.\r\n\r\n‘I am to name Tuesday for Dudley?’ she suggested.\r\n\r\n‘At any hour he pleases to appoint.’\r\n\r\n‘A visit signifies...’\r\n\r\n‘Whatever it signifies!’\r\n\r\n‘I’m thinking of the bit of annoyance.’\r\n\r\n‘To me? Anything appointed, finds me ready the next minute.’\r\n\r\nHer smile was flatteringly bright. ‘By the way, keep your City people\r\nclose about you: entertain as much as possible; dine them,’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘At home?’\r\n\r\n‘Better. Sir Rodwell Blachington, Sir Abraham Quatley: and their wives.\r\nThere’s no drawing back now. And I will meet them.’\r\n\r\nShe received a compliment. She was on the foot to go.\r\n\r\nBut she had forgotten the Tiddler mine.\r\n\r\nThe Tiddler mine was leisurely mounting. Victor stated the figures; he\r\nsaluted her hand, and Lady Grace passed out, with her heart on the top\r\nof them, and a buzz about it of the unexpected having occurred She had\r\nher experiences to match new patterns in events; though not very many.\r\nCompared with gambling, the game of love was an idle entertainment.\r\nCompared with other players, this man was gifted.\r\n\r\nVictor went in to Mr. Inchling’s room, and kept Inchling from speaking,\r\nthat he might admire him for he knew not what, or knew not well what.\r\nThe good fellow was devoted to his wife. Victor in old days had called\r\nthe wife Mrs. Grundy. She gossiped, she was censorious; she knew--could\r\nnot but know--the facts; yet never by a shade was she disrespectful. He\r\nhad a curious recollection of how his knowledge of Inchling and his\r\nwife being always in concert, entirely--whatever they might think\r\nin private--devoted to him in action, had influenced, if it had not\r\noriginally sprung, his resolve to cast off the pestilential cloak\r\nof obscurity shortening his days, and emerge before a world he could\r\nillumine to give him back splendid reflections. Inchling and his wife,\r\nit was: because the two were one: and if one, and subservient to him,\r\nknowing all the story, why, it foreshadowed a conquered world.\r\n\r\nThey were the one pulse of the married Grundy beating in his hand. So it\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nHe rattled his views upon Indian business, to hold Inchling silent, and\r\nlet his mind dwell almost lovingly on the good faithful spouse, who had\r\nno phosphorescent writing of a recent throbbing event on the four walls\r\nof his room.\r\n\r\nNataly was not so generously encountered in idea.\r\n\r\nHe felt and regretted this. He greeted her with a doubled\r\naffectionateness. Her pitiable deficiency of courage, excusing a man for\r\nthis and that small matter in the thick of the conflict, made demands on\r\nhim for gentle treatment.\r\n\r\n‘You have not seen any one?’ she asked.\r\n\r\n‘City people. And you, my love?’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Barmby called. He has gone down to Tunbridge Wells for a week, to\r\nsome friend there.’ She added, in pain of thought: ‘I have seen Dartrey.\r\nHe has brought Lord Clanconan to town, for a consultation, and expects\r\nhe will have to take him to Brighton.’\r\n\r\n‘Brighton? What a life for a man like Dartrey, at Brighton!’\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved. ‘If I cannot see my Nesta there, he will bring her up\r\nto me for a day:\r\n\r\n‘But, my dear, I will bring her up to you, if it is your wish to see\r\nher.’\r\n\r\n‘It is becoming imperative that I should.’\r\n\r\n‘No hurry, no hurry: wait till the end of next week. And I must see\r\nDartrey, on business, at once!’\r\n\r\nShe gave the address in a neighbouring square. He had minutes to spare\r\nbefore dinner, and flew. She was not inquisitive.\r\n\r\nColney Durance had told Dartrey that Victor was killing her. She had\r\nlittle animation; her smiles were ready, but faint. After her interview\r\nwith Dudley, there had been a swoon at home; and her maid, sworn to\r\nsecrecy, willingly spared a tender-hearted husband--so good a master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. MRS. MARSETT\r\n\r\nLittle acts of kindness were not beyond the range of Colney Durance,\r\nand he ran down to Brighton, to give the exiled Nesta some taste of\r\nher friendly London circle. The Duvidney ladies knew that the dreaded\r\ngentleman had a regard for the girl. Their own, which was becoming\r\nwarmer than they liked to think, was impressed by his manner of\r\nconversing with her. ‘Child though she was,’ he paid her the compliment\r\nof a sober as well as a satirical review of the day’s political\r\nmatter and recent publications; and the ladies were introduced, in\r\na wonderment, to the damsel Delphica. They listened placidly to a\r\ndiscourse upon her performances, Japanese to their understandings.\r\n\r\nAt New York, behold, another adventurous representative and advocate\r\nof the European tongues has joined the party: Signor Jeridomani: a\r\nphilologer, of course; a politician in addition; Macchiavelli redivivus,\r\nit seems to fair Delphica. The speech he delivers at the Syndicate\r\nDelmonico Dinner, is justly applauded by the New York Press as a\r\nmasterpiece of astuteness. He appears to be the only one of the party\r\nwho has an eye for the dark. She fancies she may know a more widely\r\nawake in the abstract. But now, thanks to jubilant Journals and Homeric\r\nlaughter over the Continent, the secret is out, in so far as the\r\nconcurrents are all unmasked and exposed for the edification of the\r\nAmerican public. Dr. Bouthoin’s eyebrows are up, Mr. Semhians disfigures\r\nhis name by greatly gaping. Shall they return to their Great Britain\r\nindignant? Patriotism, with the sauce of a luxurious expedition at no\r\ncost to the private purse, restrains them. Moreover, there is no sign of\r\nany one of the others intending to quit the expedition; and Mr. Semhians\r\nhas done a marvel or two in the cricket-field: Old England looks up\r\nwhere she can. What is painfully extraordinary to our couple, they find\r\nin the frigid attitude of the Americans toward their ‘common tongue’;\r\ntogether with the rumour of a design to despatch an American rival\r\nemissary to Japan.\r\n\r\nNesta listened, inquired, commented, laughed; the ladies could not have\r\na doubt that she was interested and understood. She would have sketches\r\nof scenes between Delphica and M. Falarique, with whom the young\r\nGermania was cleverly ingenuous indeed--a seminary Celimene; and between\r\nDelphica and M. Mytharete, with whom she was archaeological, ravishingly\r\namoebaean of Homer. Dr. Gannius holds a trump card in his artless\r\ndaughter, conjecturally, for the establishment of the language of the\r\ngutturals in the far East. He has now a suspicion, that the inventive M.\r\nFalarique, melted down to sobriety by misfortune, may some day startle\r\ntheir camp by the cast of more than a crow into it, and he is bent\r\non establishing alliances; frightens the supple Signor Jeridomani to\r\nlingual fixity; eulogizes Football, with Dr. Bouthoin; and retracts, or\r\nmodifies, his dictum upon the English, that, ‘masculine brawn they have\r\nin their bodies, but muscle they have not in their feminine minds’;\r\nto exalt them, for a signally clean, if a dense, people: ‘Amousia, not\r\nAlousia, is their enemy:’--How, when we have the noblest crop of poets?\r\n‘You have never heartily embraced those aliens among you until you\r\nlearnt from us, that you might brag of them.’--Have they not endowed us\r\nwith the richest of languages? ‘The words of which are used by you,\r\nas old slippers, for puns.’ Mr. Semhians has been superciliously\r\nand ineffectively punning in foreign presences: he and his chief are\r\ninwardly shocked by a new perception; What if, now that we have the\r\npopulace for paymaster, subservience to the literary tastes of the\r\npopulace should reduce the nation to its lowest mental level, and render\r\nus not only unable to compete with the foreigner, but unintelligible to\r\nhim, although so proudly paid at home! Is it not thus that nations are\r\nseen of the Highest to be devouring themselves?\r\n\r\n‘For,’ says Dr. Gannius, as if divining them, ‘this excessive and\r\napplauded productiveness, both of your juvenile and your senile, in\r\nyour modern literature, is it ever a crop? Is it even the restorative\r\nperishable stuff of the markets? Is it not rather your street-pavement’s\r\npatter of raindrops, incessantly in motion, and as fruitful?’ Mr.\r\nSemhians appeals to Delphica. ‘Genius you have,’ says she, stiffening\r\nhis neck-band, ‘genius in superabundance’:--he throttles to the\r\ncomplexion of the peony:--‘perhaps criticism is wanting.’ Dr. Gannius\r\nadds: ‘Perhaps it is the drill-sergeant everywhere wanting for an\r\nunrivalled splendid rabble!’\r\n\r\nColney left the whole body of concurrents on the raised flooring of a\r\nfamous New York Hall, clearly entrapped, and incited to debate before\r\nan enormous audience, as to the merits of their respective languages.\r\n‘I hear,’ says Dr. Bouthoin to Mr. Semhians (whose gape is daily\r\nextending), ‘that the tickets cost ten dollars!’\r\n\r\nThere was not enough of Delphicafor Nests.\r\n\r\nColney asked: ‘Have you seen any of our band?’\r\n\r\n‘No,’ she said, with good cheer, and became thoughtful, conscious of a\r\nfunny reason for the wish to hear of the fictitious creature disliked by\r\nDudley. A funny and a naughty reason, was it? Not so very naughty: but\r\nit was funny; for it was a spirit of opposition to Dudley, without an\r\ninferior feeling at all, such as girls should have.\r\n\r\nColney brought his viola for a duet; they had a pleasant musical\r\nevening, as in old days at Creckholt; and Nesta, going upstairs with the\r\nladies to bed, made them share her father’s amused view of the lamb\r\nof the flock this bitter gentleman became when he had the melodious\r\ninstrument tucked under his chin. He was a guest for the night. Dressing\r\nin the early hour, Nests saw him from her window on the parade, and soon\r\njoined him, to hear him at his bitterest, in the flush of the brine.\r\n‘These lengths of blank-faced terraces fronting sea!’ were the\r\nsatirist’s present black beast. ‘So these moneyed English shoulder\r\nto the front place; and that is the appearance they offer to their\r\ncommercial God!’ He gazed along the miles of ‘English countenance,’\r\ndrearily laughing. Changeful ocean seemed to laugh at the spectacle.\r\nSome Orphic joke inspired his exclamation: ‘Capital!’\r\n\r\n‘Come where the shops are,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘And how many thousand parsons have you here?’\r\n\r\n‘Ten, I think,’ she answered in his vein, and warmed him; leading him\r\ncontemplatively to scrutinize her admirers: the Rev. Septimus; Mr.\r\nSowerby.\r\n\r\n‘News of our friend of the whimpering flute?’\r\n\r\n‘Here? no. I have to understand you!’\r\n\r\nColney cast a weariful look backward on the ‘regiments of Anglo-Chinese’\r\nrepresented to him by the moneyed terraces, and said: ‘The face of a\r\nstopped watch!--the only meaning it has is past date.’\r\n\r\nHe had no liking for Dudley Sowerby. But it might have been an allusion\r\nto the general view of the houses. But again, ‘the meaning of it past\r\ndate,’ stuck in her memory. A certain face close on handsome, had a\r\nfatal susceptibility to caricature.\r\n\r\nShe spoke of her ‘exile’: wanted Skepsey to come down to her; moaned\r\nover the loss of her Louise. The puzzle of the reason for the long\r\nseparation from her parents, was evident in her mind, and unmentioned.\r\n\r\nThey turned on to the pier.\r\n\r\nNesta reminded him of certain verses he had written to celebrate her\r\nvisit to the place when she was a child:\r\n\r\n         ‘“And then along the pier we sped,\r\n          And there we saw a Whale\r\n          He seemed to have a Normous Head,\r\n          And not a bit of Tail!”’\r\n\r\n‘Manifestly a foreigner to our shores, where the exactly inverse\r\ncondition rules,’ Colney said.\r\n\r\n         ‘“And then we scampered on the beach,\r\n          To chase the foaming wave;\r\n          And when we ran beyond its reach\r\n          We all became more brave.”’\r\n\r\nColney remarked: ‘I was a poet--for once.’\r\n\r\nA neat-legged Parisianly-booted lady, having the sea, winds very\r\nenterprising with her dark wavy, locks and jacket and skirts, gave a cry\r\nof pleasure and--a silvery ‘You dear!’ at sight of Nesta; then at sight\r\nof one of us, moderated her tone to a propriety equalling the most\r\nconventional. ‘We ride to-day?’\r\n\r\n‘I shall be one,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘It would not be the commonest pleasure to me, if you were absent.’\r\n\r\n‘Till eleven, then!’\r\n\r\n‘After my morning letter to Ned.’\r\n\r\nShe sprinkled silvery sound on that name or on the adieu, blushed,\r\nblinked, frowned, sweetened her lip-lines, bit at the underone, and\r\npassed in a discomposure.\r\n\r\n‘The lady?’ Colney asked.\r\n\r\n‘She is--I meet her in the troop conducted by the riding-master: Mrs.\r\nMarsett.’\r\n\r\n‘And who is Ned?’\r\n\r\n‘It is her husband, to whom she writes every morning. He is a captain in\r\nthe army, or was. He is in Norway, fishing.’\r\n\r\n‘Then the probability is, that the English officer continues his\r\nmilitary studies.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you not think her handsome, Mr. Durance?’\r\n\r\n‘Ned may boast of his possession, when he has trimmed it and toned it a\r\nlittle!\r\n\r\n‘She is different, if you are alone with her.’\r\n\r\n‘It is not unusual,’ said Colney.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock he was in London, and Nesta rode beside Mrs. Marsett\r\namid the troop.\r\n\r\nA South-easterly wind blew the waters to shifty goldleaf prints of\r\nbrilliance under the sun.\r\n\r\n‘I took a liberty this morning, I called you “Dear” this morning,’\r\nthe lady said. ‘It’s what I feel, only I have no right to blurt out\r\neverything I feel, and I was ashamed. I am sure I must have appeared\r\nridiculous. I got quite nervous.’\r\n\r\n‘You would not be ridiculous to me.’\r\n\r\n‘I remember I spoke of Ned!\r\n\r\n‘You have spoken of him before.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! I know: to you alone. I should like to pluck out my heart and pitch\r\nit on the waves, to see whether it would sink or swim. That’s a funny\r\nidea, isn’t it! I tell you everything that comes up. What shall I\r\ndo when I lose you! You always make me feel you’ve a lot of poetry\r\nready-made in you.’\r\n\r\n‘We will write. And you will have your husband then.’\r\n\r\n‘When I had finished my letter to Ned, I dropped my head on it and\r\nbehaved like a fool for several minutes. I can’t bear the thought of\r\nlosing you!’\r\n\r\n‘But you don’t lose me,’ said Nesta; ‘there is no ground for your\r\nsupposing that you will. And your wish not to lose me, binds me to you\r\nmore closely.’\r\n\r\n‘If you knew!’ Mrs. Marsett caught at her slippery tongue, and she\r\ncarolled: ‘If we all knew everything, we should be wiser, and what a\r\nnaked lot of people we should be!’\r\n\r\nThey were crossing the passage of a cavalcade of gentlemen, at the end\r\nof the East Cliff. One among them, large and dominant, with a playful\r\nvoice of brass, cried out:\r\n\r\n‘And how do you do, Mrs. Judith Marsett--ha? Beautiful morning?’\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett’s figure tightened; she rode stonily erect, looked level\r\nahead. Her woman’s red mouth was shut fast on a fighting underlip.\r\n\r\n‘He did not salute you,’ Nesta remarked, to justify her for not having\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nThe lady breathed a low thunder: ‘Coward!’\r\n\r\n‘He cannot have intended to insult you,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘That man knows I will not notice him. He is a beast. He will learn that\r\nI carry a horsewhip.’\r\n\r\n‘Are you not taking a little incident too much to heart?’\r\n\r\nThe sigh of the heavily laden came from Mrs. Marsett.\r\n\r\n‘Am I pale? I dare say. I shall go on my knees tonight hating myself\r\nthat I was born “one of the frail sex.” We are, or we should ride at the\r\ncoward and strike him to the ground. Pray, pray do not look distressed!\r\nNow you know my Christian name. That dog of a man barks it out on the\r\nroads. It doesn’t matter.’\r\n\r\n‘He has offended you before?’\r\n\r\n‘You are near me. They can’t hurt me, can’t touch me, when I think that\r\nI ‘m talking with you. How I envy those who call you by your Christian\r\nname!’\r\n\r\n‘Nesta,’ said smiling Nesta. The smile was forced, that she might show\r\nkindness, for the lady was jarring on her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett opened her lips: ‘Oh, my God, I shall be crying!--let’s\r\ngallop. No, wait, I’ll tell you. I wish I could! I will tell you of that\r\nman. That man is Major Worrell. One of the majors who manage to get to\r\ntheir grade. A retired warrior. He married a handsome woman, above him\r\nin rank, with money; a good woman. She was a good woman, or she would\r\nhave had her vengeance, and there was never a word against her. She must\r\nhave loved that--Ned calls him, full-blooded ox. He spent her money and\r\nhe deceived her.--You innocent! Oh, you dear! I’d give the world to have\r\nyour eyes. I’ve heard tell of “crystal clear,” but eyes like yours have\r\nto tell me how deep and clear. Such a world for them to be in! I did\r\npray, and used your name last night on my knees, that you--I said\r\nNesta--might never have to go through other women’s miseries. Ah me! I\r\nhave to tell you he deceived her. You don’t quite understand.’\r\n\r\n‘I do understand,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘God help you!--I am excited to-day. That man is poison to me. His wife\r\nforgave him three times. On three occasions, that unhappy woman forgave\r\nhim. He is great at his oaths, and a big breaker of them. She walked\r\nout one November afternoon and met him riding along with a notorious\r\ncreature. You know there are bad women. They passed her, laughing. And\r\nlook there, Nesta, see that groyne; that very one.’ Mrs. Marsett pointed\r\nher whip hard out. ‘The poor lady went down from the height here; she\r\nwalked into that rough water look!--steadying herself along it, and\r\nshe plunged; she never came out alive. A week after her burial, Major\r\nWorrell--I ‘ve told you enough.’\r\n\r\n‘We ‘ll gallop now,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett’s talk, her presence hardly less, affected the girl with\r\nthose intimations of tumult shown upon smooth waters when the great\r\nelements are conspiring. She felt that there was a cause why she had to\r\npity, did pity her. It might be, that Captain Marsett wedded one who was\r\nof inferior station,’ and his wife had to bear blows from cruel people.\r\nThe supposition seemed probable. The girl accepted it; for beyond it, as\r\nthe gathering of the gale masked by hills, lay a brewing silence. What?\r\nShe did not reflect. Her quick physical sensibility curled to some\r\nbreath of heated atmosphere brought about her by this new acquaintance:\r\nnot pleasant, if she had thought of pleasure: intensely suggestive of\r\nour life at the consuming tragic core, round which the furnace pants.\r\nBut she was unreflecting, feeling only a beyond and hidden.\r\n\r\nBesides, she was an exile. Spelling at dark things in the dark, getting\r\nto have the sight which peruses darkness, she touched the door of a\r\nmystery that denied her its key, but showed the lock; and her life was\r\nbeginning to know of hours that fretted her to recklessness. Her friend\r\nLouise was absent: she had so few friends--owing to that unsolved\r\nreason: she wanted one, of any kind, if only gentle: and this lady\r\nseemed to need her: and she flattered; Nesta was in the mood for\r\nswallowing and digesting and making sweet blood of flattery.\r\n\r\nAt one time, she liked Mrs. Marsett best absent: in musing on her,\r\nwishing her well, having said the adieu. For it was wearisome to\r\nhear praises of ‘innocence’; and women can do so little to cure that\r\n‘wickedness of men,’ among the lady’s conversational themes; and ‘love’\r\ntoo: it may be a ‘plague,’ and it may be ‘heaven’: it is better left\r\nunspoken of. But there were times when Mrs. Marsett’s looks and tones\r\ntouched compassion to press her hand: an act that had a pledgeing\r\nsignification in the girl’s bosom: and when, by the simple avoidance of\r\nejaculatory fervours, Mrs. Marsett’s quieted good looks had a shadow of\r\na tender charm, more pathetic than her outcries were.\r\n\r\nThese had not always the sanction of polite usage: and her English\r\nwas guilty of sudden lapses to the Thameswater English of commerce\r\nand drainage instead of the upper wells. But there are many uneducated\r\nladies in the land. Many, too, whose tastes in romantic literature\r\nbetray now and then by peeps a similarity to Nesta’s maid Mary’s. Mrs.\r\nMarsett liked love, blood, and adventure. She had, moreover, a favourite\r\nnoble poet, and she begged Nesta’s pardon for naming him, and she would\r\nnot name him, and told her she must not read him until she was a married\r\nwoman, because he did mischief to girls. Thereupon she fell into one\r\nof her silences, emerging with a cry of hate of herself for having ever\r\nread him. She did not blame the bard. And, ah, poor bard! he fought his\r\nbattle: he shall not be named for the brand on the name. He has lit a\r\nsulphur match for the lover of nature through many a generation; and to\r\nbe forgiven by sad frail souls who could accuse him of pipeing devil’s\r\nagent to them at the perilous instant--poor girls too!--is chastisement\r\nenough. This it is to be the author of unholy sweets: a Posterity\r\nsitting in judgement will grant, that they were part of his honest\r\nbattle with the hypocrite English Philistine, without being dupe of the\r\nplea or at all the thirsty swallower of his sugary brandy. Mrs. Marsett\r\nexpressed aloud her gladness of escape in never having met a man like\r\nhim; followed by her regret that ‘Ned’ was so utterly unlike; except\r\n‘perhaps’--and she hummed; she was off on the fraternity in wickedness.\r\n\r\nNesta’s ears were fatigued. ‘My mother writes of you,’ she said, to vary\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett looked. She sighed downright: ‘I have had my dream of\r\na friend!--It was that gentleman with you on the pier! Your mother\r\nobjects?’\r\n\r\n‘She has inquired, nothing more.’\r\n\r\n‘I am not twenty-three: not as old as I should be, for a guide to you.\r\nI know I would never do you harm. That I know. I would walk into that\r\nwater first, and take Mrs. Worrell’s plunge:--the last bath; a thorough\r\ncleanser for a woman! Only, she was a good woman and didn’t want it, as\r\nwe--as lots of us do:--to wash off all recollection of having met a man!\r\nYour mother would not like me to call you Nesta! I have never begged you\r\nto call me Judith. Damnable name!’ Mrs. Marsett revelled in the heat of\r\nthe curse on it, as a relief to torture of the breast, until a sense of\r\nthe girl’s alarmed hearing sent the word reverberating along her nerves\r\nand shocked her with such an exposure of our Shaggy wild one on a lady’s\r\nlips. She murmured: ‘Forgive me,’ and had the passion to repeat the\r\nepithet in shrieks, and scratch up male speech for a hatefuller; but the\r\ntwitch of Nesta’s brows made her say: ‘Do pardon me. I did something\r\nin Scripture. Judith could again. Since that brute Worrell crossed me\r\nriding with you, I loathe my name; I want to do things. I have offended\r\nyou.’\r\n\r\n‘We have been taught differently. I do not use those words. Nothing\r\nelse.’\r\n\r\n‘They frighten you.’\r\n\r\n‘They make me shut; that is all.’\r\n\r\n‘Supposing you were some day to discover... ta-tata, all the things\r\nthere are in the world.’ Mrs. Marsett let fly an artificial chirrup.\r\n‘You must have some ideas of me.’\r\n\r\n‘I think you have had unhappy experiences.’\r\n\r\n‘Nesta... just now and then! the first time we rode out together,\r\ncoming back from the downs, I remember, I spoke, without thinking--I was\r\nenraged--of a case in the newspapers; and you had seen it, and you were\r\nnot afraid to talk of it. I remember I thought, Well, for a girl, she’s\r\nbold! I thought you knew more than a girl ought to know: until--you\r\ndid--you set my heart going. You spoke of the poor women like an angel\r\nof compassion. You said, we were all mixed up with their fate--I forget\r\nthe words. But no one ever heard in Church anything that touched me so.\r\nI worshipped you. You said, you thought of them often, and longed to\r\nfind out what you could do to help. And I thought, if they could\r\nhear you, and only come near you, as I was--ah, my heaven! Unhappy\r\nexperiences? Yes. But when men get women on the slope to their\r\nperdition, they have no mercy, none. They deceive, and they lie; they\r\nare false in acts and words; they do as much as murder. They’re never\r\nhanged for it. They make the Laws! And then they become fathers of\r\nfamilies, and point the finger at the “wretched creatures.” They have a\r\ndozen names against women, for one at themselves.’\r\n\r\n‘It maddens me at times to think...!’ said Nesta, burning with the sting\r\nof vile names.\r\n\r\nOh, there are bad women as well as bad men: but men have the power and\r\nthe lead, and they take advantage of it; and then they turn round and\r\nexecrate us for not having what they have robbed us of!’\r\n\r\n‘I blame women--if I may dare, at my age,’ said Nesta, and her bosom\r\nheaved. ‘Women should feel for their sex; they should not allow the\r\nnames; they should go among their unhappier sisters. At the worst, they\r\nare sisters! I am sure, that fallen cannot mean--Christ shows it does\r\nnot. He changes the tone of Scripture. The women who are made outcasts,\r\nmust be hopeless and go to utter ruin. We should, if we pretend to be\r\nbetter, step between them and that. There cannot be any goodness unless\r\nit is a practiced goodness. Otherwise it is nothing more than paint on\r\ncanvas. You speak to me of my innocence. What is it worth, if it is only\r\na picture and does no work to help to rescue? I fear I think most of the\r\ndreadful names that redden and sicken us.--The Old Testament!--I have a\r\nFrench friend, a Mademoiselle Louise de Seines--you should hear her: she\r\nis intensely French, and a Roman Catholic, everything which we are not:\r\nbut so human, so wise, and so full of the pride of her sex! I love\r\nher. It is love. She will never marry until she meets a man who has\r\nthe respect for women, for all women. We both think we cannot separate\r\nourselves from our sisters. She seems to me to wither men, when she\r\nspeaks of their injustice, their snares to mislead and their cruelty\r\nwhen they have succeeded. She is right, it is the--brute: there is no\r\nother word.’\r\n\r\n‘And French and good!’ Mrs. Marsett ejaculated. ‘My Ned reads French\r\nnovels, and he says, their women.... But your mademoiselle is a real\r\none. If she says all that, I could kneel to her, French or not. Does she\r\ntalk much about men and women?’\r\n\r\n‘Not often: we lose our tempers. She wants women to have professions; at\r\npresent they have not much choice to avoid being penniless. Poverty, and\r\nthe sight of luxury! It seems as if we produced the situation, to create\r\nan envious thirst, and cause the misery. Things are improving for them;\r\nbut we groan at the slowness of it.’\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett now declared a belief, that women were nearly quite as bad\r\nas men. ‘I don’t think I could take up with a profession. Unless to be a\r\nsinger. Ah! Do you sing?’\r\n\r\nNesta smiled: ‘Yes, I sing.’\r\n\r\n‘How I should like to hear you! My Ned’s a thorough\r\nEnglishman--gentleman, you know: he cares only for sport; Shooting,\r\nFishing, Hunting; and Football, Cricket, Rowing, and matches. He’s\r\nimmensely proud of England in those things. And such muscle he has!\r\nthough he begins to fancy his heart’s rather weak. It’s digestion, I\r\ntell him. But he takes me to the Opera sometimes--Italian Opera; he\r\ncan’t stand German. Down at his place in Leicestershire, he tells me,\r\nwhen there ‘s company, he has--I’m sure you sing beautifully. When I\r\nhear beautiful singing, even from a woman they tell tales of, upon my\r\nword, it’s true, I feel my sins all melting out of me and I’m new-made:\r\nI can’t bear Ned to speak. Would you one day, one afternoon, before the\r\nend of next week?--it would do me such real good, you can’t guess how\r\nmuch; if I could persuade you! I know I’m asking something out of rules.\r\nFor just half an hour: I judge by your voice in talking. Oh! it would do\r\nme good-good-good to hear you sing. There is a tuned piano--a cottage; I\r\ndon’t think it sounds badly. You would not see any great harm in calling\r\non me? once!’\r\n\r\n‘No,’ said Nesta. And it was her nature that projected the word. Her\r\nawakened wits were travelling to her from a distance, and she had an\r\nintimation of their tidings; and she could not have said what they\r\nwere; or why, for a moment, she hesitated to promise she would come. Her\r\nvision of the reality of things was without written titles, to put the\r\nstamp of the world on it. She felt this lady to be one encompassed\r\nand in the hug of the elementary forces, which are the terrors to\r\ninexperienced pure young women. But she looked at her, and dared trust\r\nthose lips, those eyes. She saw, through whatever might be the vessel,\r\nthe spirit of the woman; as the upper nobility of our brood are enabled\r\nto do in a crisis mixed of moral aversion and sisterly sympathy, when\r\nnature cries to them, and the scales of convention, the mud-spots of\r\naccident, even naughtiness, even wickedness, all misfortune’s issue, if\r\nwe but see the one look upward, fall away. Reason is not excluded from\r\nthese blind throbs of a blood that strikes to right the doings of the\r\nFates. Nesta did not err in her divination of the good and the bad\r\nincarnate beside her, though both good and bad were behind a curtain;\r\nthe latter sparing her delicate senses, appealing to chivalry, to the\r\nsimply feminine claim on her. Reason, acting in her heart as a tongue of\r\nthe flames of the forge where we all are wrought, told her surely that\r\nthe good predominated. She had the heart which is at our primal fires\r\nwhen nature speaks.\r\n\r\nShe gave the promise to call on Mrs. Marsett and sing to her.\r\n\r\n‘An afternoon? Oh! what afternoon?’ she was asked, and she said: ‘This\r\nafternoon, if you like.’\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed: Mrs. Marsett acted violently the thrill of delight she\r\nfelt in the prospect.\r\n\r\nThe ladies Dorothea and Virginia, consulted, and pronounced the name\r\nof Marsett to be a reputable County name. ‘There was a Leicestershire\r\nbaronet of the name of Marsett.’ They arranged to send their\r\nbutton-blazing boy at Nesta’s heels. Mrs. Marsett resided in a\r\nside-street not very distant from the featureless but washed and orderly\r\nterrace of the glassy stare at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. SHOWS ONE OF THE SHADOWS OF THE WORLD CROSSING A VIRGIN’S\r\nMIND\r\n\r\nNasta and her maid were brought back safely through the dusk by their\r\nconstellation of a boy, to whom the provident ladies had entrusted her.\r\nThey could not but note how short her syllables were. Her face was\r\nonly partly seen. They had returned refreshed from their drive on the\r\npopulous and orderly parade---so fair a pattern of their England!--after\r\ndiscoursing of ‘the dear child,’ approving her manners, instancing\r\nproofs of her intelligence, nay, her possession of ‘character.’ They did\r\nso, notwithstanding that these admissions were worse than their\r\ngrowing love for the girl, to confound established ideas. And now, in\r\nthoughtfulness on her behalf, Dorothea said, ‘We have considered, Nesta,\r\nthat you may be lonely; and if it is your wish, we will leave our\r\ncard on your new acquaintance.’ Nesta took her hand and kissed it; she\r\ndeclined, saying, ‘No,’ without voice.\r\n\r\nThey had two surprises at the dinner-hour. One was the card of Dartrey\r\nFenellan, naming an early time next day for his visit; and the other was\r\nthe appearance of the Rev. Stuart Rem, a welcome guest. He had come to\r\nmeet his Bishop.\r\n\r\nHe had come also with serious information for the ladies, regarding\r\nthe Rev. Abram Posterley. No sooner was this out of his mouth than both\r\nladies exclaimed:\r\n\r\n‘Again!’ So serious was it, that there had been a consultation at the\r\nWells; Mr. Posterley’s friend, the Rev. Septimus Barmby, and his own\r\nfriend, the Rev. Groseman Buttermore, had journeyed from London to sit\r\nupon the case: and, ‘One hoped,’ Mr. Stuart Rem said, ‘poor Posterley\r\nwould be restored to the senses he periodically abandoned.’ He laid a\r\nhand on Tasso’s curls, and withdrew it at a menace of teeth. Tasso would\r\nsubmit to rough caresses from Mr. Posterley; he would not allow Mr.\r\nStuart Rem to touch him. Why was that? Perhaps for the reason of Mr.\r\nPosterley’s being so emotional as perpetually to fall a victim to some\r\nbright glance and require the rescue of his friends; the slave of woman\r\nhad a magnet for animals!\r\n\r\nDorothea and Virginia were drawn to compassionate sentiments, in spite\r\nof the provokeing recurrence of Mr. Posterley’s malady. He had not\r\nan income to support a wife. Always was this unfortunate gentleman\r\nentangling himself in a passion for maid or widow of the Wells and it\r\nwas desperate, a fever. Mr. Stuart Rem charitably remarked on his\r\ntaking it so severely because of his very scrupulous good conduct.\r\nThey pardoned a little wound to their delicacy, and asked: ‘On this\r\noccasion?’ Mr. Stuart Rem named a linendraper’s establishment near the\r\npantiles, where a fair young woman served. ‘And her reputation?’ That\r\nwas an article less presentable through plate-glass, it seemed: Mr.\r\nStuart Rem drew a prolonged breath into his nose.\r\n\r\n‘It is most melancholy!’ they said in unison. ‘Nothing positive,’ said\r\nhe. ‘But the suspicion of a shadow, Mr. Stuart Rem! You will not\r\npermit it?’ He stated, that his friend Buttermore might have influence.\r\nDorothea said: ‘When I think of Mr. Posterley’s addiction to ceremonial\r\nobservances, and to matrimony, I cannot but think of a sentence that\r\nfell from Mr. Durance one day, with reference to that division of our\r\nChurch: he called it:--you frown! and I would only quote Mr. Durance\r\nto you in support of your purer form, as we hold it to be--with the\r\ncandles, the vestments, Confession, alas! he called it, “Rome and a\r\nwife.”’\r\n\r\nMr. Stuart Rem nodded an enforced assent: he testily dismissed mention\r\nof Mr. Durance, and resumed on Mr. Posterley.\r\n\r\nThe good ladies now, with some of their curiosity appeased,\r\nconsiderately signified to him, that a young maiden was present.\r\n\r\nThe young maiden had in heart stuff to render such small gossip a hum\r\nof summer midges. She did not imagine the dialogue concerned her in any\r\nway. She noticed Mr. Stuart Rem’s attentive scrutiny of her from time\r\nto time. She had no sensitiveness, hardly a mind for things about her.\r\nTo-morrow she was to see Captain Dartrey. She dwelt on that prospect,\r\nfor an escape from the meshes of a painful hour--the most woeful of the\r\nhours she had yet known-passed with Judith Marsett: which dragged her\r\nsoul through a weltering of the deeps, tossed her over and over, still\r\ndid it with her ideas. It shocked her nevertheless to perceive how much\r\nof the world’s flayed life and harsh anatomy she had apprehended, and\r\nso coldly, previous to Mrs. Marsett’s lift of the veil in her story\r\nof herself: a skipping revelation, terrible enough to the girl; whose\r\ncomparison of the previously suspected things with the things now\r\nrevealed imposed the thought of her having been both a precocious and\r\na callous young woman: a kind of ‘Delphica without the erudition,’ her\r\nmind phrased it airily over her chagrin.--And the silence of Dudley\r\nproved him to have discovered his error in choosing such a person--he\r\nwas wise, and she thanked him. She had an envy of the ignorant-innocents\r\nadored by the young man she cordially thanked for quitting her. She\r\nadmired the white coat of armour they wore, whether bestowed on them by\r\ntheir constitution or by prudence. For while combating mankind now on\r\nJudith Marsett’s behalf, personally she ran like a hare from the mere\r\nbreath of an association with the very minor sort of similar charges;\r\nardently she desired the esteem of mankind; she was at moments abject.\r\nBut had she actually been aware of the facts now known?\r\n\r\nThose wits of the virgin young, quickened to shrewdness by their budding\r\nsenses--and however vividly--require enlightenment of the audible and\r\nvisible before their sterner feelings can be heated to break them\r\naway from a blushful dread and force the mind to know. As much as the\r\nwilfully or naturally blunted, the intelligently honest have to learn by\r\ntouch: only, their understandings cannot meanwhile be so wholly obtuse\r\nas our society’s matron, acting to please the tastes of the civilized\r\nman--a creature that is not clean-washed of the Turk in him--barbarously\r\nexacts. The signor aforesaid is puzzled to read the woman, who is\r\nafter all in his language; but when it comes to reading the maiden, she\r\nappears as a phosphorescent hieroglyph to some speculative Egyptologer;\r\nand he insists upon distinct lines and characters; no variations, if he\r\nis to have sense of surety. Many a young girl is misread by the amount\r\nshe seems to know of our construction, history, and dealings, when it\r\nis not more than her sincere ripeness of nature, that has gathered the\r\nfacts of life profuse about her, and prompts her through one or other of\r\nthe instincts, often vanity, to show them to be not entirely strange to\r\nher; or haply her filly nature is having a fling at the social harness\r\nof hypocrisy. If you (it is usually through the length of ears of\r\nyour Novelist that the privilege is yours) have overheard queer\r\ncommunications passing between girls, and you must act the traitor\r\neavesdropper or Achilles masquerader to overhear so clearly, these,\r\nbe assured, are not specially the signs of their corruptness. Even the\r\nexceptionally cynical are chiefly to be accused of bad manners. Your\r\nMoralist is a myopic preacher, when he stamps infamy, on them, or on our\r\nlater generation, for the kick they have at grandmother decorum, because\r\nyou do not or cannot conceal from them the grinning skeleton behind it.\r\n\r\nNesta once had dreams of her being loved: and she was to love in return\r\nfor a love that excused her for loving double, treble; as not her lover\r\ncould love, she thought with grateful pride in the treasure she was to\r\npour out at his feet; as only one or two (and they were women) in the\r\nworld had ever loved. Her notion of the passion was parasitic: man the\r\ntree, woman the bine: but the bine was flame to enwind and to soar,\r\nserpent to defend, immortal flowers to crown. The choice her parents had\r\nmade for her in Dudley, behind the mystery she had scent of, nipped her\r\ndream, and prepared her to meet, as it were, the fireside of a November\r\nday instead of springing up and into the dawn’s blue of full summer\r\nwith swallows on wing. Her station in exile at the Wells of the weariful\r\nrich, under the weight of the sullen secret, unenlivened by Dudley’s\r\ncourtship, subdued her to the world’s decrees; phrased thus: ‘I am not\r\nto be a heroine.’ The one golden edge to the view was, that she would\r\ngreatly please her father.\r\n\r\nHer dream of a love was put away like a botanist’s pressed weed.\r\nBut after hearing Judith Marsett’s wild sobs, it had no place in her\r\ncherishing. For, above all, the unhappy woman protested love to have\r\nbeen the cause of her misery. She moaned of ‘her Ned’; of his goodness,\r\nhis deceitfulness, her trustfulness; his pride and the vileness of his\r\nfriends; her longsuffering and her break down of patience. It was done\r\nfor the proof of her unworthiness of Nesta’s friendship: that she might\r\nbe renounced, and embraced. She told the pathetic half of her story, to\r\nsuit the gentle ear, whose critical keenness was lost in compassion.\r\nHow deep the compassion, mixed with the girl’s native respect for the\r\nevil-fortuned, may be judged by her inaccessibility to a vulgar tang\r\nthat she was aware of in the deluge of the torrent, where Innocence and\r\nNed and Love and a proud Family and that beast Worrell rolled together\r\nin leaping and shifting involutions.\r\n\r\nA darkness of thunder was on the girl. Although she was not one to\r\nshrink beneath it like the small bird of the woods, she had to say\r\nwithin herself many times, ‘I shall see Captain Dartrey to-morrow,’ for\r\na recovery and a nerving. And with her thought of him, her tooth was at\r\nher underlip, she struggled abashed, in hesitation over men’s views of\r\nher sex, and how to bring a frank mind to meet him; to be sure of his\r\nnot at heart despising; until his character swam defined and bright\r\nacross her scope. ‘He is good to women.’ Fragments of conversation,\r\nprincipally her father’s, had pictured Captain Dartrey to her most\r\nmanfully tolerant toward a frivolous wife.\r\n\r\nHe came early in the morning, instantly after breakfast.\r\n\r\nNot two minutes had passed before she was at home with him. His words,\r\nhis looks, revived her spirit of romance, gave her the very landscapes,\r\nand new ones. Yes, he was her hero. But his manner made him also an\r\nadored big brother, stamped splendid by the perils of life. He sat\r\nsquare, as if alert to rise, with an elbow on a knee, and the readiest\r\nturn of head to speakers, the promptest of answers, eyes that were a\r\nbrighter accent to the mouth, so vividly did look accompany tone. He\r\nrallied her, chatted and laughed; pleased the ladies by laughing\r\nat Colney Durance, and inspired her with happiness when he spoke of\r\nEngland:--that ‘One has to be in exile awhile, to see the place she\r\ntakes.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Captain Dartrey, I do like to hear you say so,’ she cried; his\r\nvoice was reassuring also in other directions: it rang of true man.\r\n\r\nHe volunteered, however, a sad admission, that England had certainly\r\nlost something of the great nation’s proper conception of Force: the\r\nmeaning of it, virtue of it, and need for it. ‘She bleats for a lesson,\r\nand will get her lesson.’\r\n\r\nBut if we have Captain Dartrey, we shall come through! So said the\r\nsparkle of Nesta’s eyes.\r\n\r\n‘She is very like her father,’ he said to the ladies.\r\n\r\n‘We think so,’ they remarked.\r\n\r\n‘There’s the mother too,’ said he; and Nesta saw that the ladies\r\nshadowed.\r\n\r\nThey retired. Then she begged him to ‘tell her of her own dear mother.’\r\nThe news gave comfort, except for the suspicion, that the dear mother\r\nwas being worn by her entertaining so largely. ‘Papa is to blame,’ said\r\nNesta.\r\n\r\n‘A momentary strain. Your father has an idea of Parliament; one of the\r\nLondon Boroughs.’\r\n\r\n‘And I, Captain Dartrey, when do I go back to them?’\r\n\r\n‘Your mother comes down to consult with you. And now, do we ride\r\ntogether?’\r\n\r\n‘You are free?’\r\n\r\n‘My uncle, Lord Clan, lets me out.’\r\n\r\n‘To-day?’\r\n\r\n‘Why, yes!’\r\n\r\n‘This morning?’\r\n\r\n‘In an hour’s time.’\r\n\r\n‘I will be ready.’\r\n\r\nNesta sent a line of excuse to Mrs. Marsett, throwing in a fervent\r\nadjective for balm.\r\n\r\nThat fair person rode out with the troop under conduct of the hallowing\r\nsquire of the stables, and passed by Nesta on horseback beside Dartrey\r\nFenellan at the steps of a huge hotel; issuing from which, pretty Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy was about to mount. Mrs. Marsett looked ahead and coloured,\r\nbut she could not restrain one look at Nesta, that embraced her\r\ncavalier. Nesta waved hand to her, and nodded. Mrs. Marsett withdrew her\r\neyes; her doing so, silent though it was, resembled the drag back to sea\r\nof the shingle-wave below her, such a screaming of tattle she heard in\r\nthe questions discernible through the attitude of the cavalier and of\r\nthe lady, who paused to stare, before the leap up in the saddle. ‘Who\r\nis she?--what is she?--how did you know her?--where does she come\r\nfrom?--wears her hat on her brows!--huge gauntlets out of style!--shady!\r\nshady! shady!’ And as always during her nervous tumults, the name of\r\nWorrell made diapason of that execrable uproar. Her hat on her brows had\r\nan air of dash, defying a world it could win, as Ned well knew. But she\r\nscanned her gauntlets disapprovingly. This town, we are glad to think,\r\nhas a bright repute for glove-shops. And Mrs. Marsett could applaud\r\nherself for sparing Ned’s money; she had mended her gloves, if they were\r\nin the fashion.--But how does the money come? Hark at that lady and that\r\ngentleman questioning Miss Radnor of everything, everything in the world\r\nabout her! Not a word do they get from Miss Radnor. And it makes them\r\nthe more inquisitive. Idle rich people, comfortably fenced round, are\r\nso inquisitive! And Mrs. Marsett, loving Nesta for the notice of her,\r\nmaddened by the sting of tongues it was causing, heard the wash of the\r\nbeach, without consciousness of analogies, but with a body ready to jump\r\nout of skin, out of life, in desperation at the sound.\r\n\r\nShe was all impulse; a shifty piece of unmercenary stratagem\r\noccasionally directing it. Arrived at her lodgings, she wrote to Nesta:\r\n‘I entreat you not to notice me, if you pass me on the road again. Let\r\nme drop, never mind how low I go. I was born to be wretched. A line from\r\nyou, just a line now and then, only to show me I am not forgotten. I\r\nhave had a beautiful dream. I am not bad in reality; I love goodness,\r\nI know. I cling to the thought of you, as my rescue, I declare. Please,\r\nlet me hear: if it’s not more than “good day” and your initials on a\r\npost-card.’\r\n\r\nThe letter brought Nesta in person to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. THE BURDEN UPON NESTA\r\n\r\nCould there be confidences on the subject of Mrs. Marsett with Captain\r\nDartrey?--Nesta timidly questioned her heart: she knocked at an iron\r\ndoor shut upon a thing alive. The very asking froze her, almost to\r\nstopping her throbs of pity for the woman. With Captain Dartrey, if with\r\nany one; but with no one. Not with her mother even. Toward her mother,\r\nshe felt guilty of knowing. Her mother had a horror of that curtain.\r\nNesta had seen it, and had taken her impressions; she, too, shrank from\r\nit; the more when impelled to draw near it. Louise de Seilles would\r\nhave been another self; Louise was away; when to return, the dear friend\r\ncould not state. Speaking in her ear, would have been possible; the\r\ntheme precluded writing.\r\n\r\nIt was ponderous combustible new knowledge of life for a girl to hold\r\nunaided. In the presence of the simple silvery ladies Dorothea and\r\nVirginia, she had qualms, as if she were breaking out in spots before\r\nthem. The ladies fancied, that Mr. Stuart Rem had hinted to them oddly\r\nof the girl; and that he might have meant, she appeared a little too\r\ncognizant of poor Mr. Abram Posterley’s malady--as girls in these\r\nterrible days, only too frequently, too brazenly, are. They discoursed\r\nto her of the degeneracy of the manners, nay, the morals of young\r\nEnglishwomen, once patterns! They sketched the young English gentlewoman\r\nof their time; indeed a beauty; with round red cheeks, and rounded open\r\neyes, and a demure shut mouth, a puppet’s divine ignorance; inoffensive\r\nin the highest degree, rightly worshipped. They were earnest, and Nesta\r\nstruck at herself. She wished to be as they had been, reserving her\r\npainful independence.\r\n\r\nThey were good: they were the ideal women of our country; which demands\r\nif it be but the semblance of the sureness of stationary excellence;\r\nsuch as we have in Sevres and Dresden, polished bright and smooth\r\nas ever by the morning’s flick of a duster; perhaps in danger of\r\naccidents--accidents must be kept away; but enviable, admirable, we\r\nthink, when we are not thinking of seed sown or help given to the\r\ngenerations to follow. Nesta both envied and admired; she revered them;\r\nyet her sharp intelligence, larger in the extended boundary of thought\r\ncoming of strange crimson-lighted new knowledge, discerned in a dimness\r\nwhat blest conditions had fixed them on their beautiful barren eminence.\r\nWithout challengeing it, she had a rebellious rush of sympathy for our\r\nevil-fortuned of the world; the creatures in the battle, the wounded,\r\ntrodden, mud-stained: and it alarmed her lest she should be at heart one\r\nout of the fold.\r\n\r\nShe had the sympathy, nevertheless, and renewing and increasing with the\r\npulsations of a compassion that she took for her reflective survey. The\r\nnext time she saw Dartrey Fenellan, she was assured of him, as being the\r\nman who might be spoken to; and by a woman: though not by a girl; not\r\nspoken to by her. The throb of the impulse precipitating speech subsided\r\nto a dumb yearning. He noticed her look: he was unaware of the human sun\r\nin the girl’s eyes taking an image of him for permanent habitation in\r\nher breast. That face of his, so clearly lined, quick, firm, with the\r\nblue smile on it like the gleam of a sword coming out of sheath, did not\r\nmean hardness, she could have vowed. O that some woman, other than the\r\nunhappy woman herself, would speak the words denied to a girl! He was\r\nthe man who would hearken and help. Essential immediate help was to be\r\ngiven besides the noble benevolence of mind. Novel ideas of manliness\r\nand the world’s need for it were printed on her understanding. For what\r\ncould women do in aid of a good cause! She fawned: she deemed herself\r\nvery despicably her hero’s inferior. The thought of him enclosed her. In\r\na prison, the gaoler is a demi-God-hued bright or black, as it may be;\r\nand, by the present arrangement between the sexes, she, whom the world\r\nallowed not to have an intimation from eye or ear, or from nature’s\r\nblood-ripeness in commune with them, of certain matters, which it\r\nsuffers to be notorious, necessarily directed her appeal almost in\r\nworship to the man, who was the one man endowed to relieve, and who\r\nlocked her mouth for shame.\r\n\r\nThus was she, too, being put into her woman’s harness of the bit and\r\nthe blinkers, and taught to know herself for the weak thing, the gentle\r\nparasite, which the fiction of our civilization expects her, caressingly\r\nand contemptuously, to become in the active, while it is exacted of\r\nhero Comedy of Clowns!--that in the passive she be a rockfortress\r\nimpregnable, not to speak of magically encircled. She must also have\r\nher feelings; she must not be an unnatural creature. And she must have\r\na sufficient intelligence; for her stupidity does not flatter the\r\npossessing man. It is not an organic growth that he desires in his mate,\r\nbut a happy composition. You see the world which comes of the pair.\r\n\r\nThis burning Nesta, Victor’s daughter, tempered by Nataly’s milder\r\nblood, was a girl in whom the hard shocks of the knowledge of life,\r\nperforce of the hardness upon pure metal, left a strengthening for\r\ngenerous imagination. She did not sit to brood on her injured senses\r\nor set them through speculation touching heat; they were taken up\r\nand consumed by the fire of her mind. Nor had she leisure for the\r\nabhorrences, in a heart all flowing to give aid, and uplift and restore.\r\nSelf was as urgent in her as in most of the young; but the gift of\r\nhumour, which had previously diverted it, was now the quick feeling for\r\nher sisterhood, through the one piteous example she knew; and broadening\r\nit, through her insurgent abasement on their behalf, which was her\r\nscourged pride of sex. She but faintly thought of blaming the men whom\r\nher soul besought for justice, for common kindness, to women. There was\r\nthe danger, that her aroused young ignorance would charge the whole of\r\nthe misery about and abroad upon the stronger of those two: and another\r\ndanger, that the vision of the facts below the surface would discolour\r\nand disorder her views of existence. But she loved, she sprang to, the\r\nlighted world; and she had figures of male friends, to which to cling;\r\nand they helped in animating glorious historical figures on the world’s\r\nlibrary-shelves or under yet palpitating earth. Promise of a steady\r\nbalance of her nature, too, was shown in the absence of any irritable\r\nurgency to be doing, when her bosom bled to help. Beyond the resolve,\r\nthat she would not abandon the woman who had made confession to her, she\r\nformed no conscious resolutions. Far ahead down her journey of the years\r\nto come, she did see muffled things she might hope and would strive to\r\ndo. They were chrysalis shapes. Above all, she flew her blind quickened\r\nheart on the wings of an imaginative force; and those of the young\r\nwho can do that, are in their blood incorruptible by dark knowledge,\r\nirradiated under darkness in the mind. Let but the throb be kept for\r\nothers. That is the one secret, for redemption; if not for preservation.\r\n\r\nVictor descended on his marine London to embrace his girl, full of\r\nregrets at Fredi’s absence from the great whirl ‘overhead,’ as places of\r\nmultitudinous assembly, where he shone, always appeared to him. But it\r\nwas not to last long; she would soon be on the surface again! At the\r\nfirst clasp of her, he chirped some bars of her song. He challenged her\r\nto duet before the good ladies, and she kindled, she was caught up\r\nby his gaiety, wondering at herself; faintly aware of her not being\r\nspontaneous. And she made her father laugh, just in the old way; and\r\nlooked at herself in his laughter, with the thought, that she could\r\nnot have become so changed; by which the girl was helped to jump to her\r\nhumour. Victor turned his full front to Dorothea and Virginia, one\r\nsunny beam of delight and although it was Mr. Stuart Rem who was naughty\r\nNesta’s victim, and although it seemed a trespass on her part to speak\r\nin such a manner of a clerical gentleman, they were seized; they were\r\nthe opposite partners of a laughing quadrille, lasting till they were\r\ntired out.\r\n\r\nVictor had asked his girl, if she sang on a Sunday. The ladies\r\nremembered, that she had put the question for permission to Mr. Stuart\r\nRem, who was opposed to secular singing.\r\n\r\n‘And what did he say?’ said Victor.\r\n\r\nNesta shook her head: ‘It was not what he said, papa; it was his look.\r\nHis duty compelled him, though he loves music. He had the look of a\r\nPatriarch putting his handmaiden away into the desert.’\r\n\r\nDorothea and Virginia, in spite of protests within, laughed to streams.\r\nThey recollected the look; she had given the portrait of Mr. Stuart Rem\r\nin the act of repudiating secular song.\r\n\r\n‘Victor conjured up a day when this darling Fredi, a child, stood before\r\na famous picture in the Brera, at Milan; when he and her mother noticed\r\nthe child’s very studious graveness; and they had talked of it; he\r\nremarking, that she disapproved of the Patriarch; and Nataly, that she\r\nwas taken with Hagar’s face.\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised at her not having heard from Dudley.\r\n\r\n‘How is that?’ said he.\r\n\r\n‘Most probably because he has not written, papa.’\r\n\r\nHe paused after the cool reply. She had no mournful gaze at all; but\r\nin the depths of the clear eyes he knew so well, there was a coil of\r\nsomething animate, whatever it might be. And twice she drew a heavy\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned it in London. Nataly telegraphed at night for her girl to\r\nmeet her next day at Dartrey’s hotel.\r\n\r\nTheir meeting was incomprehensibly joyless to the hearts of each,\r\nthough it was desired, and had long been desired, and mother was mother,\r\ndaughter daughter, without diminution of love between them. They held\r\nhands, they kissed and clasped, they showered their tender phrases with\r\nfull warm truth, and looked into eyes and surely saw one another. But\r\nthe heart of each was in a battle of its own, taking wounds or crying\r\nfor supports. Whether to speak to her girl at once, despite the now\r\nvehement contrary counsel of Victor, was Nataly’s deliberation, under\r\nthe thought of the young creature’s perplexity in not seeing her at the\r\nhouse of the Duvidney ladies: while Nesta conjured in a flash the past\r\nimpressions of her mother’s shrinking distaste from any such hectic\r\nthemes as this which burdened and absorbed her; and she was almost\r\njoining to it, through sympathy with any thought or feeling of one in\r\nwhom she had such pride; she had the shudder of revulsion. Further,\r\nNataly put on, rather cravenly an air, of distress, or she half\r\ndesigningly permitted her trouble to be seen, by way of affecting her\r\ngirl’s recollection when the confession was to come, that Nesta might\r\nthen understand her to have been restrained from speaking, not evasive\r\nof her duty. The look was interpreted by Nesta as belonging to\r\nthe social annoyances dating, in her calendar, from Creckholt,\r\napprehensively dreaded at Lakelands. She hinted asking, and her mother\r\nnodded; not untruthfully; but she put on a briskness after the nod; and\r\na doubt was driven into Nesta’s bosom.\r\n\r\nHer dear Skepsey was coming down to her for a holiday, she was glad\r\nto hear. Of Dudley, there was no word. Nataly shunned his name, with\r\na superstitious dread lest any mention of him should renew pretensions\r\nthat she hoped, and now supposed, were quite withdrawn. So she had told\r\npoor Mr. Barmby only yesterday, at his humble request to know. He had\r\nseen Dudley on the pantiles, walking with a young lady, he said. And\r\n‘he feared,’ he said; using, a pardonable commonplace of deceit. Her\r\ncompassion accounted for the ‘fear’ which was the wish, and caused her\r\nnot to think it particularly strange, that he should imagine Dudley to\r\nhave quitted the field. Now that a disengaged Dartrey Fenellan was at\r\nhand, poor Mr. Barmby could have no chance.\r\n\r\nDartrey came to her room by appointment. She wanted to see him alone,\r\nand he informed her, that Mrs. Blathenoy was in the hotel, and would\r\ncertainly receive and amuse Nesta for any length of time.\r\n\r\n‘I will take her up,’ said Nataly, and rose, and she sat immediately,\r\nand fluttered a hand at her breast. She laughed: ‘Perhaps I’m tired!’\r\n\r\nDartrey took Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe returned, saying: ‘There’s a lift in the hotel. Do the stairs affect\r\nyou at all?’\r\n\r\nShe fenced his sharp look. ‘Laziness, I fancy; age is coming on. How is\r\nit Mrs. Blathenoy is here?’\r\n\r\n‘Well! how?’ ‘Foolish curiosity?’ ‘I think I have made her of service.\r\nI did not bring the lady here.’ ‘Of service to whom?’ ‘Why, to Victor!’\r\n‘Has Victor commissioned you?’ ‘You can bear to hear it. Her husband\r\nknows the story. He has a grudge... commercial reasons. I fancy it is,\r\nthat Victor stood against his paper at the table of the Bank. Blathenoy\r\nvowed blow for blow. But I think the little woman holds him in. She says\r\nshe does.’ ‘Victor prompted you?’ ‘It occurred as it occurred.’ ‘She\r\ndoes it for love of us?--Oh! I can’t trifle. Dartrey!’ ‘Tell me.’\r\n‘First, you haven’t let me know what you think of my Nesta.’ ‘She’s a\r\ndear good girl.’ ‘Not so interesting to you as a flighty little woman!’\r\n‘She has a speck of some sort on her mind.’ Nataly spied at Dudley’s\r\nbehaviour, and said: ‘That will wear away. Is Mr. Blathenoy much here?’\r\n‘As often as he can come, I believe.’ ‘That is...?’ ‘I have seen him\r\ntwice.’ ‘His wife remains?’ ‘Fixed here for the season.’ ‘My friend!’\r\n‘No harm, no harm!’ ‘But-to her!’ ‘You have my word of honour.’ ‘Yes:\r\nand she is doing you a service, at your request; you occasionally reward\r\nher with thanks; and she sees you are a man of honour. Do you not know\r\nwomen?’\r\n\r\nDartrey blew his pooh-pooh on feminine suspicions. ‘There’s very little\r\nleft of the Don Amoroso in me. Women don’t worship stone figures.’\r\n\r\n‘They do: like the sea-birds. And what do you say to me, Dartrey?--I can\r\nconfess it: I am one of them: I love you. When last you left England,\r\nI kissed your hand. It was because of your manly heart in that stone\r\nfigure. I kept from crying: you used to scorn us English for the\r\n“whimpering fits” you said we enjoy and must have in books, if we can’t\r\nget them up for ourselves. I could have prayed to have you as brother\r\nor son. I love my Victor the better for his love of you. Oh!--poor\r\nsoul--how he is perverted since that building of Lakelands! He cannot\r\ntake soundings of the things he does. Formerly he confided in me, in all\r\nthings: now not one;--I am the chief person to deceive. If only he had\r\nwaited! We are in a network of intrigues and schemes, every artifice in\r\nLondon--tempting one to hate simple worthy people, who naturally have\r\ntheir views, and see me an impostor, and tolerate me, fascinated by\r\nhim:--or bribed--it has to be said. There are ways of bribeing. I trust\r\nhe may not have in the end to pay too heavily for succeeding. He seems\r\na man pushed by Destiny; not irresponsible, but less responsible than\r\nmost. He is desperately tempted by his never failing. Whatever he\r\ndoes!.. it is true! And it sets me thinking of those who have never had\r\nan ailment, up to a certain age, when the killing blow comes. Latterly\r\nI have seen into him: I never did before. Had I been stronger, I might\r\nhave saved, or averted.... But, you will say, the stronger woman would\r\nnot have occupied my place. I must have been blind too. I did not\r\nsee, that his nature shrinks from the thing it calls up. He dreads the\r\nexposure he courts--or has to combat with all his powers. It has been\r\na revelation to me of him life as well. Nothing stops him. Now it is\r\nParliament--a vacant London Borough. He counts on a death: Ah! terrible!\r\nI have it like a snake’s bite night and day.’\r\n\r\nNataly concluded: ‘There: it has done me some good to speak. I feel so\r\nbase.’ She breathed heavily.\r\n\r\nDartrey took her hand and bent his lips to it. ‘Happy the woman who has\r\nnot more to speak! How long will Nesta stay here?’\r\n\r\n‘You will watch over her, Dartrey? She stays-her father wishes--up\r\nto--ah! We can hardly be in such extreme peril. He has her doctor, her\r\nlawyer, and her butler--a favourite servant--to check, and influence,\r\nher: She--you know who it is!--does not, I am now convinced, mean\r\npersecution. She was never a mean-minded woman. Oh! I could wish she\r\nwere. They say she is going. Then I am to be made an “honest woman\r\nof.” Victor wants Nesta, now that she is away, to stay until... You\r\nunderstand. He feels she is safe from any possible kind of harm with\r\nthose good ladies. And I feel she is the safer for having you near.\r\nOtherwise, how I should pray to have you with us! Daily I have to\r\npass through, well, something like the ordeal of the red-hot\r\nploughshares--and without the innocence, dear friend! But it’s best that\r\nmy girl should not have to be doing the same; though she would have the\r\ninnocence. But she writhes under any shadow of a blot. And for her\r\nto learn the things that are in the world, through her mother’s\r\nhistory!--and led to know it by the falling away of friends, or say,\r\nacquaintances! However ignorant at present, she learns from a mere\r\nnothing. I dread!.... In a moment, she is a blaze of light. There have\r\nbeen occurrences. Only Victor could have overcome them! I had to think\r\nit better for my girl, that she was absent. We are in such a whirl up\r\nthere! So I work round again to “how long?” and the picture of myself\r\ncounting the breaths of a dying woman. The other day I was told I was\r\nenvied!’\r\n\r\n‘Battle, battle, battle; for all of us, in every position!’ said Dartrey\r\nsharply, to clip a softness: ‘except when one’s attending on an invalid\r\nuncle. Then it’s peace; rather like extinction. And I can’t be crying\r\nfor the end either. I bite my moustache and tap foot on the floor, out\r\nof his hearing; make believe I’m patient. Now I ‘ll fetch Nesta.’\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy came down with an arm on Nesta’s shoulder. She held a\r\ntelegram, and said to Nataly--\r\n\r\n‘What can this mean? It’s from my husband; he puts “Jacob”: my husband’s\r\nChristian name:--so like my husband, where there’s no concealment!\r\nThere--he says:\r\n\r\n“Down to-night else pack ready start to-morrow.” Can it signify, affairs\r\nare bad with my husband in the city?’\r\n\r\nIt had that signification to Nataly’s understanding. At the same time,\r\nthe pretty little woman’s absurd lisping repetition of ‘my husband’ did\r\nnot seem without design to inflict the wound it caused.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it was not malicious; it came of the bewitchment of a\r\nsilly tongue by her knowledge of the secret to be controlled: and after\r\ncontrasting her fortunes with Nataly’s, on her way downstairs, she had\r\ncomforted herself by saying, that at least she had a husband. She was\r\nnot aware that she dealt a hurt until she had found a small consolation\r\nin the indulgence: for Captain Dartrey Fenellan admired this commanding\r\nfigure of a woman, who could not legally say that which the woman he\r\nadmired less, if at all, legally could say.\r\n\r\n‘I must leave you to interpret,’ Nataly remarked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy resented her unbefitting queenly style. For this\r\nreason, she abstained from an intended leading up to mention of the\r\n‘singular-looking lady’ seen riding with Miss Radnor more than once; and\r\nas to whom, Miss Radnor (for one gives her the name) had not just now,\r\nwhen questioned, spoken very clearly. So the mother’s alarms were not\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nAnd really it was a pity, Mrs. Blathenoy said to Dartrey subsequently;\r\nfinding him colder than before Mrs. Radnor’s visit; it was a pity,\r\nbecause a young woman in Miss Radnor’s position should not by any\r\npossibility be seen in association with a person of commonly doubtful\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nShe was denied the petulant satisfaction of rousing the championship\r\nbitter to her. Dartrey would not deliver an opinion on Miss Radnor’s\r\nconduct. He declined, moreover, to assist in elucidating the telegram by\r\n‘looking here,’ and poring over the lines beside a bloomy cheek. He was\r\npetulantly whipped on the arm with her glove, and pouted at. And it was\r\nthen--and then only or chiefly through Nataly’s recent allusion--that\r\nthe man of honour had his quakings in view of the quagmire, where he was\r\nplanted on an exceedingly narrow causeway, not of the firmest. For\r\nshe was a pretty little woman, one of the prize gifts of the present\r\neducation of women to the men who are for having them quiescent domestic\r\npatterns; and her artificial ingenuousness or candid frivolities came to\r\nher by nature to kindle the nature of the gentleman on the other bank of\r\nthe stream, and witch him to the plunge, so greatly mutually regretted\r\nafter taken: an old duet to the moon.\r\n\r\nDartrey escaped to the Club, where he had a friend. The friend was\r\nColonel Sudley, one of the modern studious officers, not in good\r\nesteem with the authorities. He had not forgiven Dartrey for the\r\nintemperateness which cut off a brilliant soldier from the service. He\r\nwas reduced to acknowledge, however, that there was a sparkling defence\r\nfor him to reply with, in the shape of a fortune gained and where we\r\nhave a Society forcing us to live up to an expensive level, very\r\ntrying to a soldier’s income, a fortune gained will offer excuses for\r\nmisconduct short of disloyal or illegal. They talked of the state of the\r\nArmy: we are moving. True, and at the last Review, the ‘march past’\r\nwas performed before a mounted generalissimo profoundly asleep, head on\r\nbreast. Our English military ‘moving’ may now be likened to Somnolency\r\non Horseback. ‘Oh, come, no rancour,’ said the colonel; ‘you know he’s a\r\nkind old boy at heart; nowhere a more affectionate man alive!’\r\n\r\n‘So the sycophants are sure of posts!’\r\n\r\n‘Come, I say! He’s devoted to the Service.’\r\n\r\n‘Invalid him, and he shall have a good epitaph.’\r\n\r\n‘He’s not so responsible as the taxpayer.’\r\n\r\n‘There you touch home. Mother Goose can’t imagine the need for defence\r\nuntil a hand’s at her feathers.’\r\n\r\n‘What about her shrieks now and then?’\r\n\r\n‘Indigestion of a surfeit?’\r\n\r\nThey were in a laughing wrangle when two acquaintances of the colonel’s\r\ncame near. One of them recognized Dartrey. He changed a prickly subject\r\nto one that is generally as acceptable to the servants of Mars. His\r\ncompanion said: ‘Who is the girl out with Judith Marsett?’ He flavoured\r\neulogies of the girl’s good looks in easy garrison English. She was\r\npraised for sitting her horse well. One had met her on the parade, in\r\nthe afternoon, walking with Mrs. Marsett. Colonel Sudley had seen them\r\non horseback. He remarked to Dartrey:\r\n\r\n‘And by the way, you’re a clean stretch ahead of us. I’ve seen you go\r\nby these windows, with the young lady on one side, and a rather pretty\r\nwoman on the other too.’\r\n\r\n‘Nothing is unseen in this town!’ Dartrey rejoined.\r\n\r\nStrolling to his quarters along the breezy parade at night, he proposed\r\nto himself, that he would breathe an immediate caution to Nesta. How had\r\nshe come to know this Mrs. Marsett? But he was more seriously thinking\r\nof what Colney Durance called ‘The Mustard Plaster’; the satirist’s\r\nphrase for warm relations with a married fair one: and Dartrey, clear of\r\nany design to have it at his breast, was beginning to take intimations\r\nof pricks and burns. They are an almost positive cure of inflammatory\r\ninternal conditions. They were really hard on him, who had none to be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nThe hour was nigh midnight. As he entered his hotel, the porter ran off\r\nto the desk in his box, and brought him a note, saying, that a lady\r\nhad left it at half-past nine. Left it?--Then the lady could not be the\r\nalarming lady. He was relieved. The words of the letter were cabalistic;\r\nthese, beneath underlined address:\r\n\r\n‘I beg you to call on me, if I do not see you this evening. It is\r\nurgent; you will excuse me when I explain. Not late to-morrow. I am sure\r\nyou will not fail to come. I could write what would be certain to bring\r\nyou. I dare not trust any names to paper.’\r\n\r\nThe signature was, Judith Marsett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. SHOWS HOW THE SQUIRES IN A CONQUEROR’S SERVICE HAVE AT\r\nTIMES TO DO KNIGHTLY CONQUEST OF THEMSELVES\r\n\r\nBy the very earliest of the trains shot away to light and briny air from\r\nLondon’s November gloom, which knows the morning through increase of\r\ngasjets, little Skepsey was hurried over suburban chimneys, in his\r\nfriendly third-class carriage; where we have reminders of ancient\r\npastoral times peculiar to our country, as it may chance; but where a\r\nman may speak to his neighbour right off without being deemed offensive.\r\nThat is homely. A social fellow knitting closely to his fellows when he\r\nmeets them, enjoys it, even at the cost of uncushioned seats he can, if\r\nimps are in him, merryandrew as much as he pleases; detested punctilio\r\ndoes not reign there; he can proselytize for the soul’s welfare; decry\r\nor uphold the national drink; advertize a commercial Firm deriving\r\nprosperity from the favour of the multitude; exhort to patriotism. All\r\nis accepted. Politeness is the rule, according to Skepsey’s experience\r\nof the Southern part of the third-class kingdom. And it is as well to\r\nmark the divisions, for the better knowledge of our countrymen. The\r\nNorth requires volumes to itself.\r\n\r\nThe hard-grained old pirate-stock Northward has built the land, and is\r\nto the front when we are at our epic work. Meanwhile it gets us a blowzy\r\ncharacter, by shouldering roughly among the children of civilization.\r\nSkepsey, journeying one late afternoon up a Kentish line, had, in both\r\nsenses of the word, encountered a long-limbed navvy; an intoxicated,\r\nhe was compelled by his manly modesty to desire to think; whose loathly\r\ntalk, forced upon the hearing of a decent old woman opposite him,\r\npassed baboonish behaviour; so much so, that Skepsey civilly intervened;\r\nsubsequently inviting him to leave the carriage and receive a lesson at\r\nthe station they were nearing. Upon his promising faithfully, that it\r\nshould be a true and telling lesson, the navvy requested this pygmy\r\nspark to flick his cheek, merely to show he meant war in due sincerity;\r\nand he as faithfully, all honour, promising not to let it bring about a\r\nbreakage of the laws of the Company, Skepsey promptly did the deed. So\r\nthey went forth.\r\n\r\nSkepsey alluded to the incident, for an example of the lamentable\r\ndeficiency in science betrayed by most of our strong men when put to it;\r\nand the bitter thought, that he could count well nigh to a certainty on\r\nthe total absence of science in the long-armed navvy, whose fist on\r\nhis nose might have been as the magnet of a pin, was chief among his\r\nreminiscences after the bout, destroying pleasure for the lover of Old\r\nEngland’s might. One blow would have sent Skepsey travelling. He was not\r\nseriously struck once. They parted, shaking hands; the navvy confessing\r\nhimself to have ‘drunk a drop’; and that perhaps accounted for his\r\nhaving been ‘topped by a dot on him.’\r\n\r\nHe declined to make oath never to repeat his offence; but said, sending\r\nhis vanquisher to the deuce, with an amicable push at his shoulder,\r\n‘Damned if I ever forget five foot five stretched six foot flat!’\r\n\r\nSkepsey counted his feet some small amount higher; but our hearty\r\nrovers’ sons have their ballad moods when giving or taking a thrashing.\r\nOne of the third-class passengers, a lad of twenty, became Skepsey’s\r\npupil, and turned out clever with the gloves, and was persuaded to enter\r\nthe militia, and grew soon to be a corporal. Thus there was profit of\r\nthe affair, though the navvy sank out of sight. Let us hope and pray he\r\nwill not insult the hearing of females again. If only females knew how\r\nnecessary it is, for their sakes, to be able to give a lesson now and\r\nthen! Ladies are positively opposed. And Judges too, who dress so like\r\nthem. The manhood of our country is kept down, in consequence. Mr.\r\nDurance was right, when he said something about the state of war being\r\nwanted to weld our races together: and yet we are always praying for the\r\nstate of peace, which causes cracks and gaps among us! Was that what\r\nhe meant by illogical? It seemed to Skepsey--oddly, considering his\r\ninferior estimate of the value of the fair sex--that a young woman with\r\nwhom he had recently made acquaintance; and who was in Brighton now,\r\nupon missionary work; a member of the ‘Army,’ an officer of advancing\r\nrank, Matilda Pridden, by name; was nearer to the secret of the right\r\ncourse of conduct for individual citizens and the entire country than\r\nany gentleman he knew.\r\n\r\nYes, nearer to it than his master was! Thinking of Mr. Victor Radnor,\r\nSkepsey fetched a sigh. He had knocked at his master’s door at the\r\noffice one day, and imagining the call to enter, had done so, and had\r\nseen a thing he could not expunge. Lady Grace Halley was there. From\r\nmatters he gathered, Skepsey guessed her to be working for his master\r\namong the great folks, as he did with Jarniman, and Mr. Fenellan with\r\nMr. Carling. But is it usual; he asked himself--his natural veneration\r\nframing the rebuke to his master thus--to repay the services of a\r\nlady so warmly?--We have all of us an ermined owl within us to sit in\r\njudgement of our superiors as well as our equals; and the little man,\r\nnotwithstanding a servant’s bounden submissiveness, was forced to hear\r\nthe judicial pronouncement upon his master’s behaviour. His master had,\r\nat the same time, been saying most weighty kind words more and more of\r\nlate: one thing:--that, if he gave all he had to his fellows, and\r\ndid all he could, he should still be in their debt. And he was a very\r\nwealthy gentleman. What are we to think? The ways of our superiors are\r\nwonderful. We do them homage: still we feel, we painfully feel, we are\r\nbeginning to worship elsewhere. It is the pain of a detachment of the\r\nvery roots of our sea-weed heart from a rock. Mr. Victor Radnor was an\r\nhonour to his country. Skepsey did not place the name of Matilda Pridden\r\nbeside it or in any way compare two such entirely different persons. At\r\nthe same time and most earnestly, while dreading to hear, he desired\r\nto have Matilda Pridden’s opinion of the case distressing him. He never\r\ncould hear it, because he could never be allowed to expound the case to\r\nher. Skepsey sighed again: he as much as uttered: Oh, if we had a few\r\nthousands like her!--But what if we do have them? They won’t marry!\r\nThere they are, all that the country requires in wives and mothers; and\r\nlike Miss Priscilla Graves, they won’t marry!\r\n\r\nHe looked through sad thoughts across the benches of the compartments\r\nto the farther end of the carriage, where sat the Rev. Septimus Barmby,\r\nlooking at him through a meditation as obscure if not so mournful. Few\r\nare the third-class passengers outward at that early hour in the winter\r\nseason, and Skepsey’s gymnastics to get beside the Rev. Septimus were\r\nunimpeded; though a tight-packed carriage of us poor journaliers would\r\nnot have obstructed them with as much as a sneer. Mr. Barmby and Skepsey\r\ngreeted. The latter said, he had a holiday, to pay a visit to Miss\r\nNesta. The former said, he hoped he should see Miss Nesta. Skepsey then\r\nrapidly brought the conversation to a point where Matilda Pridden was\r\ncomprised. He discoursed of the ‘Army’ and her position in the Army,\r\ngiving instances of her bravery, the devotion shown by her to the cause\r\nof morality, in all its forms. Mr. Barmby had his fortunes on his hands\r\nat the moment, he could not lend an attentive ear; and he disliked this\r\nArmy, the title it had taken, and the mixing of women and men in its\r\nranks; not to speak of a presumption in its proceedings, and the public\r\nmarching and singing. Moreover, he enjoyed his one or two permissible\r\nglasses: he doubted that the Chiefs of the Army had common benevolence\r\nfor the inoffensive pipe. But the cause of morality was precious to him;\r\nmorality and a fit of softness, and the union of the happiest contrast\r\nof voices, had set him for a short while, before the dawn of Nesta’s\r\nday, hankering after Priscilla Graves. Skepsey’s narrative of Matilda\r\nPridden’s work down at the East of London; was effective; it had the\r\nring to thrill a responsive chord in Mr. Barmby, who mused on London’s\r\nEast, and martyrly service there. His present expectations were of a\r\nvery different sort; but a beautiful bride, bringing us wealth, is no\r\nmisleading beam, if we direct the riches rightly. Septimus, a solitary\r\nminister in those grisly haunts of the misery breeding vice, must needs\r\naccomplish less than a Septimus the husband of one of England’s chief\r\nheiresses:--only not the most brilliant, owing to circumstances known to\r\nthe Rev. Groseman Buttermore: strangely, and opportunely, revealed: for\r\nher exceeding benefit, it may be hoped. She is no longer the ignorant\r\ngirl, to reject the protecting hand of one whose cloth is the best of\r\ncloaking. A glance at Dudley Sowerby’s defection, assures our worldly\r\nwisdom too, that now is the time to sue.\r\n\r\nSeveral times while Mr. Barmby made thus his pudding of the desires of\r\nthe flesh and the spirit, Skepsey’s tales of Matilda Pridden’s heroism\r\ncaught his attention. He liked her deeds; he disliked the position in\r\nwhich the young woman placed herself to perform them; and he said so.\r\nWomen are to be women, he said.\r\n\r\nSkepsey agreed: ‘If we could get men to do the work, sir!’\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby was launching forth: Plenty of men!--His mouth was blocked by\r\nthe reflection, that we count the men on our fingers; often are we, as\r\nit were, an episcopal thumb surveying scarce that number of followers!\r\nHe diverged to censure of the marchings and the street-singing: the\r\nimpediment to traffic, the annoyance to a finely musical ear.\r\nHe disapproved altogether of Matilda Pridden’s military display,\r\npronouncing her to be, ‘Doubtless a worthy young person.’\r\n\r\n‘Her age is twenty-seven,’ said Skepsey, spying at the number of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n‘You have known her long?’ Mr. Barmby asked.\r\n\r\n‘Not long, sir. She has gone through trouble. She believes very strongly\r\nin the will:--If I will this, if I will that, and it is the right\r\nwill, not wickedness, it is done--as good as done; and force is quite\r\nsuperfluous. In her sermons, she exhorts to prayer before action.’\r\n\r\n‘Preaches?’\r\n\r\n‘She moves a large assembly, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘It would seem, that England is becoming Americanized!’ exclaimed\r\nthe Conservative in Mr. Barmby. Almost he groaned; and his gaze was\r\nfish-like in vacancy, on hearing the little man speak of the present\r\nintrepid forwardness of the sex to be publicly doing. It is for men the\r\nmost indigestible fact of our century: one that--by contrast throws an\r\noverearthly holiness on our decorous dutiful mothers, who contentedly\r\nworked below the surface while men unremittingly attended to their\r\ninterests above.\r\n\r\nSkepsey drew forth a paper-covered shilling-book: a translation from the\r\nFrench, under a yelling title of savage hate of Old England and cannibal\r\nglee at her doom. Mr. Barmby dropped his eyelashes on it, without\r\ncomment; nor did he reply to Skepsey’s forlorn remark: ‘We let them\r\nthink they could do it!’\r\n\r\nBehold the downs. Breakfast is behind them. Miss Radnor likewise: if the\r\npoor child has a name. We propose to supply the deficiency. She does not\r\ndeclare war upon tobacco. She has a cultured and a beautiful voice. We\r\nabstain from enlargeing on the charms of her person. She has resources,\r\nwhich representatives of a rival creed would plot to secure.\r\n\r\n‘Skepsey, you have your quarters at the house of Miss Radnor’s\r\nrelatives?’ said Mr. Barmby, as they emerged from tunnelled chalk.\r\n\r\n‘Mention, that I think of calling in the course of the day.’\r\n\r\nA biscuit had been their breakfast without a name.\r\n\r\nThey parted at the station, roused by the smell of salt to bestow a\r\nmore legitimate title on the day’s restorative beginning. Down the\r\nhill, along by the shops, and Skepsey, in sight of Miss Nesta’s terrace,\r\nconsidered it still an early hour for a visitor; so, to have the sea\r\nabout him, he paid pier-money, and hurried against the briny wings of\r\na South-wester; green waves, curls of foam, flecks of silver, under\r\nlow-flying grey-dark cloud-curtains shaken to a rift, where at one\r\nshot the sun had a line of Nereids nodding, laughing, sparkling to him.\r\nSkepsey enjoyed it, at the back of thoughts military and naval. Visible\r\nsea, this girdle of Britain, inspired him to exultations in reverence.\r\nHe wished Mr. Durance could behold it now and have such a breastful.\r\nHe was wishing he knew a song of Britain and sea, rather fancying Mr.\r\nDurance to be in some way a bar to patriotic poetical recollection, when\r\nhe saw his Captain Dartrey mounting steps out of an iron anatomy of the\r\npier, and looking like a razor off a strap.\r\n\r\n‘Why, sir!’ cried Skepsey.\r\n\r\n‘Just a plunge and a dozen strokes,’ Dartrey said; ‘and you’ll come to\r\nmy hotel and give me ten minutes of the “recreation”; and if you don’t\r\ncome willingly, I shall insult your country.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! I wish Mr. Durance were here,’ Skepsey rejoined.\r\n\r\n‘It would upset his bumboat of epigrams. He rises at ten o’clock to\r\na queasy breakfast by candlelight, and proceeds to composition. His\r\npicture of the country is a portrait of himself by the artist.’\r\n\r\n‘But, sir, Captain Dartrey, you don’t think as Mr. Durance does of\r\nEngland!’\r\n\r\n‘There are lots to flatter her, Skepsey! A drilling can’t do her harm.\r\nYou’re down to see Miss Nesta. Ladies don’t receive quite so early.\r\nAnd have you breakfasted? Come on with me quick.’ Dartrey led him on,\r\nsaying: ‘You have an eye at my stick. It was a legacy to me, by word of\r\nmouth, from a seaman of a ship I sailed in, who thought I had done him a\r\nservice; and he died after all. He fell overboard drunk. He perished\r\nof the villain stuff. One of his messmates handed me the stick in Cape\r\nTown, sworn to deliver it. A good knot to grasp; and it ‘s flexible\r\nand strong; stick or rattan, whichever you please; it gives point or\r\ncaresses the shoulder; there’s no break in it, whack as you may. They\r\ncall it a Demerara supple-jack. I’ll leave it to you.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey declared his intention to be the first to depart. He tried\r\nthe temper of the stick, bent it a bit, and admired the prompt\r\nstraightening.\r\n\r\n‘It would give a good blow, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Does its business without braining.’\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the reason, that it was not a handsome instrument for\r\ndisplay on fashionable promenades, Dartrey chose it among his collection\r\nby preference; as ugly dogs of a known fidelity are chosen for\r\ncompanions. The Demerara supple-jack surpasses bull-dogs in its fashion\r\nof assisting the master; for when once at it, the clownish-looking thing\r\nreflects upon him creditably, by developing a refined courtliness of\r\nstyle, while in no way showing a diminution of jolly ardour for the\r\nfray. It will deal you the stroke of a bludgeon with the playfulness of\r\na cane. It bears resemblance to those accomplished natural actors,\r\nwho conversationally present a dramatic situation in two or three\r\nspontaneous flourishes, and are themselves again, men of the world, the\r\nnext minute.\r\n\r\nSkepsey handed it back. He spoke of a new French rifle. He mentioned, in\r\nthe form of query for no answer, the translation of the barking little\r\nvolume he had shown to Mr. Barmby: he slapped at his breast-pocket,\r\nwhere it was. Not a ship was on the sea-line; and he seemed to deplore\r\nthat vacancy.\r\n\r\n‘But it tells both ways,’ Dartrey said. ‘We don’t want to be hectoring\r\nin the Channel. All we want, is to be sure of our power, so as not to\r\ngo hunting and fawning for alliances. Up along that terrace Miss Nesta\r\nlives. Brighton would be a choice place for a landing.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey temporized, to get his national defences, by pleading the\r\ncountry’s love of peace.\r\n\r\n‘Then you give-up your portion of the gains of war--an awful\r\ndisgorgement,’ said Dartrey. ‘If you are really for peace, you toss all\r\nyour spare bones to the war-dogs. Otherwise, Quakerly preaching is taken\r\nfor hypocrisy.’\r\n\r\n‘I ‘m afraid we are illogical, sir,’ said Skepsey, adopting one of the\r\ncharges of Mr. Durance, to elude the abominable word.\r\n\r\n‘In you run, my friend.’ Dartrey sped him up the steps of the hotel.\r\n\r\nA little note lay on his breakfast-table. His invalid uncle’s valet gave\r\nthe morning’s report of the night.\r\n\r\nThe note was from Mrs. Blathenoy: she begged Captain Dartrey, in double\r\nunderlinings of her brief words, to mount the stairs. He debated, and he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nShe was excited, and showed a bosom compressed to explode: she had been\r\nweeping. ‘My husband is off. He bids me follow him. What would you have\r\nme do?’\r\n\r\n‘Go.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t care what may happen to your friends, the Radnors?’\r\n\r\n‘Not at the cost of your separation from your husband.’\r\n\r\n‘You have seen him!’\r\n\r\n‘Be serious.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, you cold creature! You know--you see: I can’t conceal. And you tell\r\nme to go. “Go!” Gracious heavens! I’ve no claim on you; I haven’t been\r\nable to do much; I would have--never mind! believe me or not. And now\r\nI’m to go: on the spot, I suppose. You’ve seen the man I ‘m to go to,\r\ntoo. I would bear it, if it were not away from... out of sight of I’m a\r\nfool of a woman, I know. There’s frankness for you! and I could declare\r\nyou’re saying “impudence” in your heart--or what you have for one. Have\r\nyou one?’\r\n\r\n‘My dear soul, it ‘s a flint. So just think of your duty.’ Dartrey\r\nplayed the horrid part of executioner with some skill.\r\n\r\nHer bosom sprang to descend into abysses.\r\n\r\n‘And never a greater fool than when I sent for you to see such a face\r\nas I’m showing!’ she cried, with lips that twitched and fingers that\r\nplucked at her belt. ‘But you might feel my hatred of being tied\r\nto--dragged about over the Continent by that... perhaps you think a\r\nwoman is not sensible of vulgarity in her husband! I ‘m bothering you? I\r\ndon’t say I have the slightest claim. You never made love to me, never!\r\nNever so much as pressed my hand or looked. Others have--as much as I\r\nlet them. And before I saw you, I had not an idea of another man but\r\nthat man. So you advise me to go?’\r\n\r\n‘There’s no other course.’\r\n\r\n‘No other course. I don’t see one. What have I been dreaming of! Usually\r\na woman feeling...’ she struck at her breast, ‘has had a soft word in\r\nher ear. “Go!” I don’t blame you, Captain Dartrey. At least, you ‘re not\r\nthe man to punish a woman for stripping herself, as I ‘ve done. I call\r\nmyself a fool--I’m a lunatic. Trust me with your hand.’\r\n\r\n‘There you are.’\r\n\r\nShe grasped the hand, and shut her eyes to make a long age of the\r\nholding on to him. ‘Oh, you dear dear fellow!--don’t think me unwomanly;\r\nI must tell you now: I am naked and can’t disguise. I see you are\r\nice--feel: and if you were different, I might be. You won’t be hurt by\r\nhearing you’ve made yourself dear to me--without meaning to, I know!\r\nIt began that day at Lakelands; I fell in love with you the very first\r\nminute I set eyes on you! There’s a confession for a woman to make! and\r\na married woman! I’m married, and I no more feel allegiance, as they\r\ncall it, than if there never had been a ceremony and no Jacob Blathenoy\r\nwas in existence. And why I should go to him! But you shan’t be\r\ntroubled. I did not begin to live, as a woman, before I met you. I can\r\nspeak all this to you because--we women can’t be deceived in that--you\r\nare one of the men who can be counted on for a friend.’\r\n\r\n‘I hope so,’ Dartrey said, and his mouth hardened as nature’s\r\nelectricity shot sparks into him from the touch and rocked him.\r\n\r\n‘No, not yet: I will soon let it drop,’ said she, and she was just then\r\nthrillingly pretty; she caressed the hand, placing it at her throat and\r\nmoving her chin on it, as women fondle birds. ‘I am positively to go,\r\nthen?’\r\n\r\n‘Positively, you are to go; and it’s my command.’\r\n\r\n‘Not in love with any one at all?’\r\n\r\n‘Not with a soul.’\r\n\r\n‘Not with a woman?’\r\n\r\n‘With no woman.’\r\n\r\n‘Nor maid?’\r\n\r\n‘No! and no to everything. And an end to the catechism!’\r\n\r\n‘It is really a flint that beats here?’ she said, and with a shyness\r\nin adventurousness, she struck the point of her forefinger on the rib.\r\n‘Fancy me in love with a flint! And running to be dutiful to a Jacob\r\nBlathenoy, at my flint’s command. I’m half in love with doing what I\r\nhate, because this cold thing here bids me do it. I believe I married\r\nfor money, and now it looks as if I were to have my bargain with poverty\r\nto bless it.’\r\n\r\n‘There I may help,’ said Dartrey, relieved at sight of a loophole, to\r\nspring to some initiative out of the paralysis cast on him by a pretty\r\nlittle woman’s rending of her veil. A man of honour alone with a woman\r\nwho has tossed concealment to the winds, is a riddled target indeed:\r\nhe is tempted to the peril of cajoleing, that he may escape from the\r\ntorment and the ridicule; he is tempted to sigh for the gallant spirit\r\nof his naughty adolescence. ‘Come to me--will you?--apply to me, if\r\nthere’s ever any need. I happen to have money. And forgive me for naming\r\nit.’\r\n\r\nShe groaned: ‘Don’t! I’m, sure, and I thought it from the first, you’re\r\none of the good men, and the woman who meets you is lucky, and wretched,\r\nand so she ought to be! Only to you should I!... do believe that! I\r\nwon’t speak of what excuses I’ve got. You’ve seen.’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t think of them: there’ll be danger in it.\r\n\r\n‘Shall you think of me in danger?’\r\n\r\n‘Silly, silly! Don’t you see you have to do with a flint! I’ve gone\r\nthrough fire. And if I were in love with you, I should start you off to\r\nyour husband this blessed day.’\r\n\r\n‘And you’re not the slightest wee wee bit in love with me!’\r\n\r\n‘Perfectly true; but I like you; and if we’re to be hand in hand, in the\r\ntime to come, you must walk firm at present.’\r\n\r\n‘I’m to go to-day?’\r\n\r\n‘You are.’\r\n\r\n‘Without again.’\r\n\r\nThe riddled target kicked. Dartrey contrasted Jacob Blathenoy with the\r\nfair wife, and commiseratingly exonerated her; he lashed at himself\r\nfor continuing to be in this absurdest of postures, and not absolutely\r\nsecure for all that. His head shook. ‘Friends, you’ll find best.’\r\n\r\n‘Well!’ she sighed, ‘I feel I’m doomed to go famished through life.\r\nThere’s never to be such a thing as, love, for me! I can’t tell you no\r\nwoman could: though you’ll say I’ve told enough. I shall burn with shame\r\nwhen I think of it. I could go on my knees to have your arms round me\r\nonce. I could kill myself for saying it!--I should feel that I had one\r\nmoment of real life.--I know I ought to admire you. They say a woman\r\nhates if she’s refused. I can’t: I wish I were able to. I could have\r\nhelped the Radnors better by staying here and threatening never to go to\r\nhim unless he swore not to do them injury. He’s revengeful. Just as you\r\nlike. You say “Go,” and I go. There. I may kiss your hand?’\r\n\r\n‘Give me yours.’\r\n\r\nDartrey kissed the hand. She kissed the mark of his lips. He got himself\r\naway, by promising to see her to the train for Paris. Outside her door,\r\nhe was met by the reflection, coming as a thing external, that he\r\nmight veraciously and successfully have pleaded a passionate hunger for\r\nbreakfast: nay, that he would have done so, if he had been downright in\r\nearnest. For she had the prettiness to cast a spell; a certain curve at\r\nthe lips, a fluttering droop of the eyelids, a corner of the eye, that\r\nled long distances away to forests and nests. This little woman had the\r\nrosy-peeping June bud’s plumpness. What of the man who refused to kiss\r\nher once? Cold antecedent immersion had to be thanked; and stringent\r\nvacuity; perhaps a spotting ogre-image of her possessor. Some sense of\r\nright-doing also, we hope. Dartrey angrily attributed his good conduct\r\nto the lowest motives. He went so far as to accuse himself of having\r\nforborne to speak of breakfast, from a sort of fascinated respect for\r\nthe pitch of a situation that he despised and detested. Then again, when\r\nbeginning to eat, his good conduct drew on him a chorus of the jeers of\r\nall the martial comrades he had known. But he owned he would have had\r\nless excuse than they, had he taken advantage of a woman’s inability, at\r\na weak moment, to protect herself: or rather, if he had not behaved in\r\na manner to protect her from herself. He thought of his buried wife, and\r\nthe noble in the base of that poor soul; needing constantly a present\r\nhelper, for the nobler to conquer. Be true man with a woman, she must be\r\nviler than the devil has yet made one, if she does not follow a strong\r\nright lead:--but be patient, of course. And the word patience here means\r\nmore than most men contain. Certainly a man like Jacob Blathenoy was a\r\nmouthful for any woman: and he had bought his wife, he deserved no\r\npity. Not? Probably not. That view, however, is unwholesome and opens\r\non slides. Pity of his wife, too, gets to be fervidly active with her\r\nportrait, fetches her breath about us. As for condemnation of the poor\r\nlittle woman, her case was not unexampled, though the sudden flare of it\r\nstartled rather. Mrs. Victor could read men and women closely. Yes, and\r\nVictor, when he schemed--but Dartrey declined to be throwing blame right\r\nor left. More than by his breakfast, and in a preferable direction, he\r\nwas refreshed by Skepsey’s narrative of the deeds of Matilda Pridden.\r\n\r\n‘The right sort of girl for you to know, Skepsey,’ he said. ‘The best in\r\nlife is a good woman.’\r\n\r\nSkepsey exhibited his book of the Gallic howl.\r\n\r\n‘They have their fits now and then, and they’re soon over and\r\nforgotten,’ Dartrey said. ‘The worst of it is, that we remember.’\r\n\r\nAfter the morning’s visit to his uncle, he peered at half a dozen sticks\r\nin the corner of the room, grasped their handles, and selected the\r\nDemerara supple-jack, for no particular reason; the curved knot was\r\neasy to the grasp. It was in his mind, that this person signing herself\r\nJudith Marsett, might have something to say, which intimately concerned\r\nNesta. He fell to brooding on it, until he wondered why he had not been\r\nmade a trifle anxious by the reading of the note overnight. Skepsey was\r\nleft at Nesta’s house.\r\n\r\nDartrey found himself expected by the servant waiting on Mrs. Marsett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. SHOWS HOW TEMPER MAY KINDLE TEMPER AND AN INDIGNANT WOMAN\r\nGET HER WEAPON\r\n\r\nJudith Marsett stood in her room to receive Nesta’s hero. She was\r\nflushed, and had thinned her lips for utterance of a desperate thing,\r\nafter the first severe formalities.\r\n\r\nHer aim was to preserve an impressive decorum. She was at the same time\r\nburning to speak out furious wrath, in words of savage rawness, if they\r\nshould come, as a manner of slapping the world’s cheek for the state\r\nto which it reduces its women; whom one of the superior creatures can\r\ninsult, and laugh.\r\n\r\nMen complaining of the ‘peace which is near their extinction,’ have but\r\nto shuffle with the sex; they will experience as remarkable a change as\r\nif they had passed off land on to sea.\r\n\r\nDartrey had some flitting notion of the untamed original elements\r\nwomen can bring about us, in his short observant bow to Mrs. Marsett,\r\nfollowing so closely upon the scene with Mrs. Blathenoy.\r\n\r\nBut this handsome woman’s look of the dull red line of a sombre fire,\r\nthat needed only stir of a breath to shoot the blaze, did not at all\r\nalarm him. He felt refreshingly strung by it.\r\n\r\nShe was discerned at a glance to be an aristocratic member of regions\r\nwhere the senses perpetually simmer when they are not boiling. The\r\ntalk at the Club recurred to him. How could Nesta have come to know the\r\nwoman? His questioning of the chapter of marvellous accidents, touched\r\nNesta simply, as a young girl to be protected, without abhorrently\r\ninvolving the woman. He had his ideas of the Spirit of Woman stating\r\nher case to the One Judge, for lack of an earthly just one: a story\r\ndifferent from that which is proclaimed pestilential by the body of\r\ncensors under conservatory glass; where flesh is delicately nurtured,\r\nhighly prized; spirit not so much so; and where the pretty tricking of\r\nthe flesh is taken for a spiritual ascendancy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her turbulent breast’s burden to deliver, Mrs. Marsett’s\r\nfeminine acuteness was alive upon Dartrey, confirming here and there\r\nNesta’s praises of him. She liked his build and easy carriage of a\r\nmuscular frame: her Ned was a heavy man. More than Dartrey’s figure,\r\nas she would have said, though the estimate came second, she liked his\r\nmanner with her. Not a doubt was there, that he read her position. She\r\ncould impose upon some: not upon masculine eyes like these. They did\r\nnot scrutinize, nor ruffle a smooth surface with a snap at petty\r\nimpressions; and they were not cynically intimate or dominating or\r\ntentatively amorous: clear good fellowship was in them. And it was a\r\nblessedness (whatever might be her feeling later, when she came to thank\r\nhim at heart) to be in the presence of a man whose appearance breathed\r\nof offering her common ground, whereon to meet and speak together,\r\nunburdened by the hunting world, and by the stoneing world. Such common\r\nground seems a kind of celestial to the better order of those excluded\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nDartrey relieved her midway in a rigid practice of the formalities: ‘I\r\nthink I may guess that you have something to tell me relating to Miss\r\nRadnor?’\r\n\r\n‘It is.’ Mrs. Marsett gathered up for an immediate plunge, and deferred\r\nit. ‘I met her--we went out with the riding-master. She took to me.\r\nI like her--I could say’ (the woman’s voice dropped dead low, in a\r\ntremble), ‘I love her. She is young: I could kneel to her. Do you know a\r\nMajor Worrell?’\r\n\r\n‘Worrell? no.’\r\n\r\n‘He is a-calls himself a friend of my--of Captain Marsett’s. He met us\r\nout one day.’\r\n\r\n‘He permitted himself to speak to Miss Radnor?’\r\n\r\nShe rejoiced in Dartrey’s look. ‘Not then. First let me tell you. I can\r\nhardly tell you. But Miss Radnor tells me you are not like other men.\r\nYou have made your conclusions already. Are you asking what right I\r\nhad to be knowing her? It is her goodness. Accident began it; I did not\r\ndeceive her; as soon as ever I could I--I have Captain Marsett’s promise\r\nto me: at present he’s situated, he--but I opened my heart to her: as\r\nmuch as a woman can. It came! Did I do very wrong?’\r\n\r\n‘I’m not here to decide: continue, pray.’\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett aimed at formal speech, and was driving upon her natural in\r\nanger. ‘I swear I did it for the best. She is an innocent girl... young\r\nlady: only she has a head; she soon reads things. I saw the kind of\r\ncloud in her. I spoke. I felt bound to: she said she would not forsake\r\nme.--I was bound to! And it was enough to break my heart, to think of\r\nher despising me. No, she forgave, pitied;--she was kind. Those are the\r\nangels who cause us to think of changeing. I don’t care for sermons, but\r\nwhen I meet charity: I won’t bore you!’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t.’\r\n\r\n‘My... Captain Marsett can’t bear--he calls it Psalmody. He thinks\r\nthings ought always to be as they are, with women and men; and women\r\npreachers he does detest. She is not one to preach. You are waiting to\r\nhear what I have to tell. That man Major Worrell has tried to rob me of\r\neverything I ever had to set a value on:--love, I ‘d say;--he laughs at\r\na woman like me loving.’\r\n\r\nDartrey nodded, to signify a known sort of fellow.\r\n\r\n‘She came here.’ Mrs. Marsett’s tears had risen. ‘I ought not to have\r\nlet her come. I invited her--for once: I am lonely. None of my sex--none\r\nI could respect! I meant it for only once. She promised to sing to me.\r\nAnd, Oh! how she sings! You have heard her. My whole heart came out. I\r\ndeclare I believe girls exist who can hear our way of life--and I’m not\r\nso bad except compared with that angel, who heard me, and was and is, I\r\ncould take oath, no worse for it. Some girls can; she is one. I am all\r\nfor bringing them up in complete innocence. If I was a great lady,\r\nmy daughters should never know anything of the world until they were\r\nmarried. But Miss Radnor is a young lady who cannot be hurt. She is\r\nabove us. Oh! what a treasure for a man!--and my God! for any man born\r\nof woman to insult a saint, as she is!--He is a beast!’\r\n\r\n‘Major Worrell met her here?’\r\n\r\n‘Blame me as much as you like: I do myself. Half my rage with him is at\r\nmyself for putting her in the way of such a beast to annoy. Each time\r\nshe came, I said it was to be the last. I let her see what a mercy from\r\nheaven she was to me. She would come. It has not been many times. She\r\nwishes me either to... Captain Marsett has promised. And nothing seems\r\nhard--to me when my own God’s angel is by. She is! I’m not such a\r\nbad woman, but I never before I knew her knew the meaning of the word\r\nvirtue. There is the young lady that man worried with his insulting\r\nremarks! though he must have known she was a lady:--because he found her\r\nin my rooms.’\r\n\r\n‘You were present when, as you say, he insulted her?’\r\n\r\n‘I was. Here it commenced; and he would see her downstairs.’\r\n\r\n‘You heard?’\r\n\r\n‘Of course, I never left her.’\r\n\r\n‘Give me a notion...’\r\n\r\n‘To get her to make an appointment: to let him conduct her home.’\r\n\r\n‘She was alone?’\r\n\r\n‘Her maid was below.’\r\n\r\n‘And this happened...?’\r\n\r\n‘Yesterday, after dark. My Ned--Captain Marsett encourages him to be\r\nfamiliar. I should be the lowest of women if I feared the threats of\r\nsuch a reptile of a man. I could tell you more. I can’t always refuse\r\nhis visits, though if Ned knew the cur he is! Captain Marsett is\r\neasy-going.’\r\n\r\n‘I should like to know where he lives.’\r\n\r\nShe went straight to the mantelpiece, and faced about with a card,\r\nhanding it, quite aware that it was a charge of powder.\r\n\r\nDesperate things to be done excused the desperate said; and especially\r\nthey seemed a cover to the bald and often spotty language leaping out of\r\nher, against her better taste, when her temper was up.\r\n\r\n‘Somewhere not very distant,’ said Dartrey perusing. ‘Is he in the town\r\nto-day, do you know?’\r\n\r\n‘I am not sure; he may be. Her name...’\r\n\r\n‘Have no fear. Ladies’ names are safe.’\r\n\r\n‘I am anxious that she may not be insulted again.’\r\n\r\n‘Did she show herself conscious of it?’\r\n\r\n‘She stopped speaking: she looked at the door. She may come again--or\r\nnever! through that man!’\r\n\r\n‘You receive him, at his pleasure?’\r\n\r\n‘Captain Marsett wishes me to. He is on his way home. He calls Major\r\nWorrell my pet spite. All I want is; not to hear of the man. I swear he\r\ncame yesterday on the chance of seeing--for he forced his way up past my\r\nservant; he must have seen Miss Radnor’s maid below.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t mean, that he insulted her hearing?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! Captain Fenellan, you know the style.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I thank you,’ Dartrey said. ‘The young lady is the daughter of my\r\ndearest friends. She’s one of the precious--you’re quite right. Keep the\r\ntears back.’\r\n\r\n‘I will.’ She heaved open-mouthed to get physical control of the tide.\r\n‘When you say that of her!--how can I help it? It’s I fear, because I\r\nfear... and I’ve no right to expect ever... but if I’m never again to\r\nlook on that dear face, tell her I shall--I shall pray for her in my\r\ngrave. Tell her she has done all a woman can, an angel can, to save my\r\nsoul. I speak truth: my very soul! I could never go to the utter bad\r\nafter knowing her. I don’t--you know the world--I’m a poor helpless\r\nwoman!--don’t swear to give up my Ned if he does break the word he\r\npromised once; I can’t see how I could. I haven’t her courage. I\r\nhaven’t--what it is! You know her: it’s in her eyes and her voice. If I\r\nhad her beside me, then I could starve or go to execution--I could, I am\r\ncertain. Here I am, going to do what you men hate. Let me sit.’\r\n\r\n‘Here’s a chair,’ said Dartrey. ‘I’ve no time to spare; good day, for\r\nthe present. You will permit me to call.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! come’; she cried, out of her sobs, for excuse. They were genuine,\r\nor she would better have been able to second her efforts to catch a\r\ndistinct vision of his retreating figure.\r\n\r\nShe beheld him, when he was in the street, turn for the district where\r\nMajor Worrell had his lodgeings. That set her mind moving, and her tears\r\nfell no longer.\r\n\r\nMajor Worrell was not at home. Dartrey was informed that he might be at\r\nhis Club.\r\n\r\nAt the Club he heard of the major as having gone to London and being\r\nexpected down in the afternoon. Colonel Sudley named the train: an\r\nearly train; the major was engaged to dine at the Club. Dartrey had\r\ninformation supplied to him concerning Major Worrell and Captain\r\nMarsett, also Mrs. Marsett. She had a history. Worthy citizens read the\r\ndescription of history with interest when the halo of Royalty is round\r\nit. They may, if their reading extends, perceive, that it has been the\r\nmain turbid stream in old Mammon’s train since he threw his bait for\r\nflesh. They might ask, too, whether it is likely to cease to flow while\r\nhe remains potent. The lady’s history was brief, and bore recital in a\r\nClub; came off quite honourably there. Regarding Major Worrell, the tale\r\nof him showed him to have a pass among men. He managed cleverly to\r\nget his pleasures out of a small income and a ‘fund of anecdote.’ His\r\nreputation indicated an anecdotist of the table, prevailing in the\r\nprimitive societies, where the art of conversing does not come by\r\nnature, and is exercised in monosyllabic undertones or grunts until\r\nthe narrator’s well-masticated popular anecdote loosens a digestive\r\nlaughter, and some talk ensues. He was Marsett’s friend, and he boasted\r\nof not letting Ned Marsett make a fool of himself.\r\n\r\nDartrey was not long in shaping the man’s character: Worrell belonged\r\nto the male birds of upper air, who mangle what female prey they are\r\nforbidden to devour. And he had Miss Radnor’s name: he had spoken her\r\nname at the Club overnight. He had roused a sensation, because of a man\r\nbeing present, Percy Southweare, who was related to a man as good as\r\nengaged to marry her. The major never fell into a quarrel with sons of\r\nnobles, if he could help it, or there might have been a pretty one.\r\n\r\nSo Colonel Sudley said.\r\n\r\nDartrey spoke musing: ‘I don’t know how he may class me; I have an\r\naccount to square with him.’\r\n\r\n‘It won’t do in these days, my good friend. Come and cool yourself; and\r\nwe’ll lunch here. I shan’t leave you.’\r\n\r\n‘By all means. We’ll lunch, and walk up to the station, and you will\r\npoint him out to me.’\r\n\r\nDartrey stated Major Worrell’s offence. The colonel was not astonished;\r\nbut evidently he thought less of Worrell’s behaviour to Miss Radnor in\r\nMrs. Marsett’s presence than of the mention of her name at the Club: and\r\nthat, he seemed to think, had a shade of excuse against the charge of\r\nmonstrous. He blamed the young lady who could go twice to visit a Mrs.\r\nMarsett; partly exposed a suspicion of her. Dartrey let him talk. They\r\nstrolled along the parade, and were near the pier.\r\n\r\nSuddenly saying: ‘There, beside our friend in clerical garb: here she\r\ncomes; judge if that is the girl for the foulest of curs to worry, no\r\nmatter where she’s found.’ Dartrey directed the colonel’s attention to\r\nNesta and Mr. Barmby turning off the pier and advancing.\r\n\r\nHe saluted. She bowed. There was no contraction of her eyelids; and her\r\nface was white. The mortal life appeared to be deadened in her cold wide\r\nlook; as when the storm-wind banks a leaden remoteness, leaving blown\r\nspace of sky.\r\n\r\nThe colonel said: ‘No, that’s not the girl a gentleman would offend.’\r\n\r\n‘What man!’ cried Dartrey. ‘If we had a Society for the trial of your\r\ngentleman!--but he has only to call himself gentleman to get grant of\r\nlicence: and your Society protects him. It won’t punish, and it won’t\r\nlet you. But you saw her: ask yourself--what man could offend that\r\ngirl!’\r\n\r\n‘Still, my friend, she ought to keep clear of the Marsetts.’\r\n\r\n‘When I meet him, I shall treat him as one out of the law.’\r\n\r\n‘You lead on to an ultimate argument with the hangman.’\r\n\r\nWe ‘ll dare it, to waken the old country. Old England will count none\r\nbut Worrells in time. As for discreet, if you like!--the young lady\r\nmight have been more discreet. She’s a girl with a big heart. If we were\r\nall everlastingly discreet!’\r\n\r\nDartrey may have meant, that the consequence of a prolonged conformity\r\nwould be the generation of stenches to shock to purgeing tempests the\r\ntolerant heavens over such smooth stagnancy. He had his ideas about\r\nmovement; about the good of women, and the health of his England. The\r\nfeeling of the hopelessness of pleading Nesta’s conduct, for the perfect\r\njustification of it to son or daughter of our impressing conventional\r\nworld--even to a friend, that friend a true man, a really chivalrous\r\nman--drove him back in a silence upon his natural brotherhood with souls\r\nthat dare do. It was a wonder, to think of his finding this kinship in\r\na woman. In a girl?--and the world holding that virgin spirit to be\r\nunclean or shadowed because its rays were shed on foul places? He\r\nclasped the girl. Her smitten clear face, the face of the second sigh\r\nafter torture, bent him in devotion to her image.\r\n\r\nThe clasping and the worshipping were independent of personal ardours:\r\nquaintly mixed with semi-paternal recollections of the little ‘blue\r\nbutterfly’ of the days at Craye. Farm and Creckholt; and he had heard\r\nof Dudley Sowerby’s pretensions to; her hand. Nesta’s youthfulness cast\r\ndouble age on him from the child’s past. He pictured the child; pictured\r\nthe girl, with her look of solitariness of sight; as in the desolate\r\nwide world, where her noble compassion for a woman had unexpectedly,\r\npainfully, almost by transubstantiation, rack-screwed her to woman’s\r\nmind. And above sorrowful, holy were those eyes.\r\n\r\nThey held sway over Dartrey, and lost it some steps on; his demon temper\r\nurgeing him to strike at Major Worrell, as the cause of her dismayed\r\nexpression. He was not the happier for dropping to his nature; but we\r\nproceed more easily, all of us, when the strain which lifts us a foot or\r\ntwo off our native level is relaxed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. A PAIR OF WOOERS\r\n\r\nThat ashen look of the rise out of death from one of our mortal wounds,\r\nwas caused by deeper convulsions in Nesta’s bosom than Dartrey could\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nShe had gone for the walk with Mr. Barmby, reading the omen of his tones\r\nin the request. Dorothea and Virginia would have her go. The clerical\r\ngentleman, a friend of the Rev. Abram Posterley; and one who deplored\r\npoor Mr. Posterley’s infatuation; and one besides who belonged to\r\nNesta’s musical choir in London: seemed a safe companion for the child.\r\nThe grand organ of Mr. Barmby’s voice, too, assured them of a devout\r\nseriousness in him, that arrested any scrupulous little questions. They\r\ncould not conceive his uttering the nonsensical empty stuff, compliments\r\nto their beauty and what not, which girls hear sometimes from\r\ninconsiderate gentlemen, to the having of their heads turned. Moreover,\r\nNesta had rashly promised her father’s faithful servant Skepsey to walk,\r\nout with him in the afternoon; and the ladies hoped she would find the\r\nmorning’s walk to have been enough; good little man though Skepsey was,\r\nthey were sure. But there is the incongruous for young women of station\r\non a promenade.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby headed to the pier. After pacing up and down between the\r\nbriny gulls and a polka-band, he made his way forethoughtfully to the\r\nglass-sheltered seats fronting East: where, as his enthusiasm for the\r\nsolemnity of the occasion excited him to say, ‘We have a view of the\r\nterraces and the cliffs’; and where not more than two enwrapped\r\ninvalid figures were ensconsed. Then it was, that Nesta recalled her\r\nanticipation of his possible design; forgotten by her during their talk\r\nof her dear people: Priscilla Graves and Mr. Pempton, and the Yatts, and\r\nSimeon Fenellan, Peridon and Catkin, and Skepsey likewise; and the very\r\nlatest news of her mother. She wished she could have run before him, to\r\nspare him. He would not notice a sign. Girls must wait and hear.\r\n\r\nIt was an oratorio. She watched the long wave roll on to the sinking\r\ninto its fellow; and onward again for the swell and the weariful lapse;\r\nand up at last bursting to the sheet of white. The far-heard roar and\r\nthe near commingled, giving Mr. Barmby a semblance to the powers of\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nAt the first direct note, the burden of which necessitated a pause, she\r\npetitioned him to be her friend, to think of himself as her friend.\r\n\r\nBut a vessel laden with merchandize, that has crossed wild seas for this\r\nparticular port, is hardly to be debarred from discharging its goods\r\non the quay by simple intimations of their not being wanted. We are\r\nprecipitated both by the aim and the tedium of the lengthened voyage to\r\ninsist that they be seen. We believe perforce in their temptingness; and\r\nshould allurement fail, we fall back to the belief in our eloquence. An\r\neloquence to expose the qualities they possess, is the testification in\r\nthe promise of their excellence. She is to be induced by feeling to see\r\nit. We are asking a young lady for the precious gift of her hand.\r\nWe respect her; and because of our continued respect, despite an\r\nobstruction, we have come to think we have a claim upon her gratitude;\r\ncould she but be led to understand how different we are from some other\r\nman!--from one hitherto favoured among them, unworthy of this prize,\r\nhowever personally exalted and meritorious.\r\n\r\nThe wave of wide extension rolled and sank and rose, heaving lifeless\r\nvariations of the sickly streaks on its dull green back.\r\n\r\nDudley Sowerby’s defection was hinted at and accounted for, by the\r\nworldly test of worldly considerations.\r\n\r\nWhat were they?--Nesta glanced.\r\n\r\nAn indistinct comparison was modestly presented, of one unmoved by\r\nworldly considerations.\r\n\r\nBut what were they? She was wakened by a lamp, and her darkness was all\r\ninflammable to it.\r\n\r\n‘Oh! Mr. Barmby, you have done me the honour to speak before; you know\r\nmy answer,’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘You were then subject to an influence. A false, I may say wicked,\r\nsentiment upholding celibacy.’\r\n\r\n‘My poor Louise? She never thought of influencing me. She has her views,\r\nI mine. Our friendship does not depend on a “treaty of reciprocity.”\r\n We are one at heart, each free to judge and act, as it should be in\r\nfriendship. I heard from her this morning. Her brother will be able to\r\nresume his military duties next month. Then she will return to me.’\r\n\r\n‘We propose!’ rejoined Mr. Barmby.\r\n\r\nBeholding the involuntary mercurial rogue-dimple he had started from a\r\ntwitch at the corner, of her lips, the good gentleman pursued: ‘Can we\r\ndare write our designs for the month to come? Ah!--I will say--Nesta!\r\ngive me the hope I beg to have. See the seriousness. You are at liberty.\r\nThat other has withdrawn his pretensions. We will not blame him. He\r\nis in expectation of exalted rank. Where there is any shadow...!’ Mr.\r\nBarmby paused on his outroll of the word; but immediately, not intending\r\nto weigh down his gentle hearer with the significance in it, resumed at\r\na yet more sonorous depth: ‘He is under the obligation to his family;\r\nan old, a venerable family. In the full blaze of public opinion! His\r\nconduct can be palliated by us, too. There is a right and wrong in minor\r\nthings, independent of the higher rectitude. We pardon, we can partly\r\nsupport, the worldly view.’\r\n\r\n‘There is a shadow?’ said Nesta; and her voice was lurefully\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nHe was on the footing where men are precipitated by what is within them\r\nto blunder. ‘On you--no. On you personally, not at all. No. It could not\r\nbe deemed so. Not by those knowing, esteeming--not by him who loves\r\nyou, and would, with his name, would, with his whole strength, envelop,\r\nshield ... certainly, certainly not.’\r\n\r\n‘It is on my parents?’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘But to me nothing, nothing, quite nought! To confound the innocent with\r\nthe guilty!... and excuses may exist. We know but how little we know!’\r\n\r\n‘It is on both my parents?’ she said; with a simplicity that induced him\r\nto reply: ‘Before the world. But not, I repeat...’\r\n\r\nThe band-instruments behind the sheltering glass flourished on their\r\ntermination of a waltz.\r\n\r\nShe had not heeded their playing. Now she said:\r\n\r\n‘The music is over; we must not be late at lunch’; and she stood up and\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his legs and obediently stepped out:\r\n\r\n‘I shall have your answer to-day, this evening? Nesta!’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Barmby, it will be the same. You will be kind to me in not asking\r\nme again.’\r\n\r\nHe spoke further. She was dumb.\r\n\r\nHad he done ill or well for himself and for her when he named the shadow\r\non her parents? He dwelt more on her than on himself: he would not have\r\nwounded her to win the blest affirmative. Could she have been entirely\r\nignorant?--and after Dudley Sowerby’s defection? For such it was: the\r\nRev. Stuart Rem had declared the union between the almost designated\r\nhead of the Cantor family and a young person of no name, of worse than\r\nno birth, impossible: ‘absolutely and totally impossible,’ he, had said,\r\nin his impressive fashion, speaking from his knowledge of the family,\r\nand an acquaintance with Dudley. She must necessarily have learnt why\r\nDudley Sowerby withdrew. No parents of an attractive daughter should\r\nallow her to remain unaware of her actual position in the world. It is\r\ncriminal, a reduplication of the criminality! Yet she had not spoken as\r\none astonished. She was mysterious. Women are so: young women most\r\nof all. It is undecided still whether they do of themselves conceive\r\nprinciples, or should submit to an imposition of the same upon them in\r\nterrorem. Mysterious truly, but most attractive! As Lady Bountiful of a\r\ndistrict, she would have in her maturity the majestic stature to suit\r\na dispensation of earthly good things. And, strangely, here she was, at\r\nthis moment, rivalling to excelling all others of her sex (he verified\r\nit in the crowd of female faces passing), when they, if they but knew\r\nthe facts, would visit her very appearance beside them on a common\r\nfooting as an intrusion and a scandal. To us who know, such matters are\r\nindeed wonderful!\r\n\r\nMoved by reflective compassion, Mr. Barmby resumed the wooer’s note,\r\nsome few steps after he had responded to the salutation of Dartrey\r\nFenellan and Colonel Sudley. She did not speak. She turned her forehead\r\nto him; and the absence of the world from her eyes chilled his tongue.\r\n\r\nHe declined the pleasure of the lunch with the Duvidney ladies. He\r\ndesired to be alone, to question himself fasting, to sound the deed he\r\nhad done; for he had struck on a suspicion of selfishness in it: and\r\nthough Love must needs be an egoism, Love is no warrant for the doing\r\nof a hurt to the creature beloved. Thoughts upon Skepsey and the tale\r\nof his Matilda Pridden’s labours in poor neighbourhoods, to which he had\r\nbeen inattentive during the journey down to the sea, invaded him; they\r\nwere persistent. He was a worthy man, having within him the\r\nspiritual impulse curiously ready to take the place where a material\r\ndisappointment left vacancy. The vulgar sort embrace the devil at that\r\nstage. Before the day had sunk, Mr. Barmby’s lowest wish was, to be a\r\nlight, as the instrument of his Church in her ministrations amid the\r\nhaunts of sin and slime, to such plain souls as Daniel Skepsey and\r\nMatilda Pridden. And he could still be that, if Nesta, in the chapters\r\nof the future, changed her mind. She might; for her good she would; he\r\nreserved the hope. His light was one to burn beneath an extinguisher.\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon table of the Duvidney ladies, it was a pain to Dorothea\r\nand Virginia to witness how poor the appetite their Nesta brought in\r\nfrom the briny blowy walk. They prophesied against her chances of a good\r\nsleep at night, if she did not eat heartily. Virginia timidly remarked\r\non her paleness. Both of them put their simple arts in motion to let her\r\nknow, that she was dear to them: so dear as to make them dread the hour\r\nof parting. They named their dread of it. They had consulted in private\r\nand owned to one another, that they did really love the child, and dared\r\nnot look forward to what they would do without her. The dear child’s\r\npaleness and want of appetite (they remembered they were observing\r\na weak innocent girl) suggested to them mutually the idea of a young\r\nfemale heart sickening, for the old unhappy maiden reason. But, if\r\nonly she might return with them to the Wells, the Rev. Stuart Rem would\r\nassure her to convince her of her not being quite, quite forsaken. He,\r\nor some one having sanction from Victor, might ultimately (the ladies\r\nwaiting anxiously in the next room, to fold her on the warmth of their\r\nbosoms when she had heard) impart to her the knowledge of circumstances,\r\nwhich would, under their further tuition concerning the particular\r\nsentiments of great families and the strict duties of the scions of\r\nthe race, help to account for and excuse the Hon. Dudley Sowerby’s\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThey went up to the drawing-room, talking of Skepsey and his tale of\r\nMiss Pridden, for Nesta’s amusement. Any talk of her Skepsey usually\r\nquickened her lips to reminiscent smiles and speech. Now she held on to\r\ngazeing; and sadly, it seemed; as if some object were not present.\r\n\r\nFor a vague encouragement, Dorothea said: ‘One week, and we are back\r\nhome at Moorsedge!’--not so far from Cronidge, was implied, for the\r\nadministering of some foolish temporary comfort. And it was as when a\r\nfish on land springs its hollow sides in alien air for the sustaining\r\nelement; the girl panted; she clasped Dorothea’s hand and looked at\r\nVirginia: ‘My mother--I must see her!’ she said. They were slightly\r\nstupefied by the unwonted mention of her mother. They made no reply.\r\nThey never had done so when there was allusion to her mother. Their\r\nsilence now struck a gong at the girl’s bosom.\r\n\r\nDorothea had it in mind to say, that if she thirsted for any special\r\ncomfort, the friends about her would offer consolation for confidence.\r\n\r\nBefore she could speak, Perrin the footman entered, bearing the card of\r\nthe Hon. Dudley Sowerby.\r\n\r\nMr. Dudley Sowerby begged for an immediate interview with Miss Radnor.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were somewhat agitated, but no longer perplexed as to their\r\nduties. They had quitted Moorsedge to avoid the visit of his family.\r\nIf he followed, it signified that which they could not withstand:--The\r\n‘Tivoli falls!’ as they named the fateful tremendous human passion, from\r\nthe reminiscences of an impressive day on their travels in youth; when\r\nthe leaping torrent had struck upon a tale of love they were reading.\r\nThey hurriedly entreated Nesta to command her nerves; peremptorily\r\nrequested her to stay where she was; showed her spontaneously, by way of\r\nhistrionic adjuration, the face to be worn by young ladies at greetings\r\non these occasions; kissed her and left her; Virginia whispering: ‘He is\r\ntrue!’\r\n\r\nDudley entered the drawing-room, charged with his happy burden of a love\r\nthat had passed through the furnace. She stood near a window, well in\r\nthe light; she hardly gave him welcome. His address to her was hurried,\r\nrather uncertain, coherent enough between the drop and the catch of\r\narticulate syllables. He found himself holding his hat. He placed it on\r\nthe table, and it rolled foolishly; but soon he was by her side, having\r\ntwo free hands to claim her one.\r\n\r\n‘You are thinking, you have not heard from me! I have been much\r\noccupied,’ he said. ‘My brother is ill, very ill. I have your pardon?’\r\n\r\n‘Indeed you have--if it has to be asked.’\r\n\r\n‘I have it?’\r\n\r\n‘Have I to grant it?’\r\n\r\n‘I own to remissness!\r\n\r\n‘I did not blame you.’\r\n\r\n‘Nesta...!’\r\n\r\nHer coldness was unshaken.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the call of her name. ‘I should have written--I ought to\r\nhave written!--I could not have expressed... You do forgive? So many\r\nthings!’\r\n\r\n‘You come from Cronidge to-day?’\r\n\r\n‘From my family--to you.’\r\n\r\nShe seemed resentful. His omissions as a correspondent were explicable\r\nin a sentence. It had to be deferred.\r\n\r\nReviewing for a moment the enormous internal conflict undergone by\r\nhim during the period of the silence between them, he wondered at the\r\nvastness of the love which had conquered objections, to him so poignant.\r\n\r\nThere was at least no seeing of the public blot on her birth when\r\nlooking on her face. Nor when thinking of the beauty of her character,\r\nin absence or in presence, was there any. He had mastered distaste to\r\nsuch a degree, that he forgot the assistance he had received from the\r\nheiress for enabling him to appreciate the fair young girl. Money is the\r\nimperious requirement of superior station; and more money and more: in\r\nthese our modern days of the merchant’s wealth, and the miner’s, and the\r\ngigantic American and Australian millionaires, high rank is of necessity\r\nvowed, in peril of utter eclipse; to the possession of money. Still it\r\nis, when assured, a consideration far to the rear with a gentleman in\r\nwhose bosom love and the buzzing world have fought their battle out. He\r\ncould believe it thoroughly fought out, by the prolonged endurance of\r\na contest lasting many days and nights; in the midst of which, at\r\none time, the task of writing to tell her of his withdrawal from the\r\nengagement, was the cause of his omission to write.\r\n\r\nAs to her character, he dwelt on the charm of her recovered features, to\r\nrepress an indicative dread of some intrepid force behind it, that might\r\nbe unfeminine, however gentle the external lineaments. Her features,\r\nher present aristocratic deficiency of colour, greatly pleased him; her\r\ncharacter would submit to moulding. Of all young ladies in the world,\r\nshe should be the one to shrink from a mental independence and hold to\r\nthe guidance of the man ennobling her. Did she? Her eyes were reading\r\nhim. She had her father’s limpid eyes, and when they concentrated rays,\r\nthey shot.\r\n\r\n‘Have you seen my parents, Mr. Sowerby?’\r\n\r\nHe answered smilingly, for reassuringly: ‘I have seen them.’\r\n\r\n‘My mother?’\r\n\r\n‘From your mother first. But am I not to be Dudley?’\r\n\r\n‘She spoke to you? She told you?’\r\n\r\n‘And yesterday your father--a second time.’\r\n\r\nSome remainder of suspicion in the dealing with members of this family,\r\nurged Dudley to say: ‘I understood from them, you were not?... that you\r\nwere quite...?’\r\n\r\n‘I have heard: I have guessed: it was recently--this morning, as\r\nit happened. I wish to go to my mother to-day. I shall go to her\r\nto-morrow.’\r\n\r\n‘I might offer to conduct you-now!’\r\n\r\n‘You are kind; I have Skepsey.’ She relieved the situation of its\r\ncold-toned strain in adding: ‘He is a host.’\r\n\r\n‘But I may come?--now! Have I not the right? You do not deny it me?’\r\n\r\n‘You are very generous.’\r\n\r\n‘I claim the right, then. Always. And subsequently, soon after, my\r\nmother hopes to welcome you at Cronidge. She will be glad to hear of\r\nyour naming of a day. My father bids me... he and all our family.’\r\n\r\n‘They are very generous.’\r\n\r\n‘I may send them word this evening of a day you name?’\r\n\r\n‘No, Mr. Sowerby.\r\n\r\n‘Dudley?’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot say it. I have to see my parents.’\r\n\r\n‘Between us, surely?’\r\n\r\n‘My whole heart thanks you for your goodness to me. I am unable to say\r\nmore.’\r\n\r\nHe had again observed and he slightly crisped under the speculative\r\nlook she directed on him: a simple unstrained look, that had an air of\r\nreading right in, and was worse to bear with than when the spark\r\nleaped upon some thought from her eyes: though he had no imagination of\r\nanything he concealed--or exposed, and he would have set it down to her\r\ntemporary incredulousness of his perfect generosity or power to overcome\r\nthe world’s opinion of certain circumstances. That had been a struggle!\r\nThe peculiar look was not renewed. She spoke warmly of her gratitude.\r\nShe stated, that she must of necessity see her parents at once. She\r\nsubmitted to his entreaty to conduct her to them on the morrow. It\r\nwas in the manner of one who yielded step by step, from inability to\r\ncontend.\r\n\r\nHer attitude continuing unchanged, he became sensible of a monotony\r\nin the speech with which he assailed it, and he rose to leave, not\r\ndissatisfied. She, at his urgent request, named her train for London in\r\nthe early morning. He said it was not too early. He would have desired\r\nto be warmed; yet he liked her the better for the moral sentiment\r\ncontrolling the physical. He had appointments with relatives or\r\nconnections in the town, and on that pretext he departed, hoping for\r\nthe speedy dawn of the morrow as soon as he had turned his back on the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nNo, not he the man to have pity of women underfoot! That was the\r\nthought, unrevolved, unphrased, all but unconscious, in Nesta: and while\r\nher heart was exalting him for his generosity. Under her present sense\r\nof the chilling shadow, she felt the comfort there was in being grateful\r\nto him for the golden beams which his generosity cast about her. But she\r\nhad an intelligence sharp to pierce, virgin though she was; and with the\r\nmark in sight, however distant, she struck it, unerring as an Artemis\r\nfor blood of beasts: those shrewd young wits, on the lookout to find\r\na champion, athirst for help upon a desolate road, were hard as any\r\njudicial to pronounce the sentence upon Dudley in that respect. She\r\nraised him high; she placed herself low; she had a glimpse of the\r\nstruggle he had gone through; love of her had helped him, she believed.\r\nAnd she was melted; and not the less did the girl’s implacable intuition\r\nread with the keenness of eye of a man of the world the blunt division\r\nin him, where warm humanity stopped short at the wall of social concrete\r\nforming a part of this rightly esteemed young citizen. She, too, was\r\ndivided: she was at his feet; and she rebuked herself for daring to\r\njudge--or rather, it was, for having a reserve in her mind upon a\r\nman proving so generous with her. She was pulled this way and that\r\nby sensibilities both inspiring to blind gratitude and quickening her\r\npenetrative view. The certainty of an unerring perception remained.\r\n\r\nDorothea and Virginia were seated in the room below, waiting for their\r\ncarriage, when the hall-door spoke of the Hon. Dudley’s departure; soon\r\nafter, Nesta entered to them. She swam up to Dorothea’s lap, and dropped\r\nher head on it, kneeling.\r\n\r\nThe ladies feared she might be weeping. Dorothea patted her thick brown\r\ntwisted locks of hair. Unhappiness following such an interview, struck\r\nthem as an ill sign.\r\n\r\nVirginia bent to the girl’s ear, and murmured: ‘All well?’\r\n\r\nShe replied: ‘He has been very generous.’\r\n\r\nHer speaking of the words renewed an oppression, that had darkened her\r\non the descent of stairs. For sensibilities sharp as Nesta’s, are not to\r\nbe had without their penalties: and she who had gone nigh to summing in\r\na flash the nature of Dudley, sank suddenly under that affliction often\r\nbesetting the young adventurous mind, crushing to young women:--the\r\nfascination exercised upon them by a positive adverse masculine attitude\r\nand opinion. Young men know well what it is: and if young women have\r\nby chance overcome their timidity, to the taking of any step out of\r\nthe trim pathway, they shrink, with a sense of forlornest isolation. It\r\nbecomes a subjugation; inciting to revolt, but a heavy weight to cast\r\noff. Soon it assumed its material form for the contention between\r\nher and Dudley, in the figure of Mrs. Marsett. The Nesta who had been\r\ninstructed to know herself to be under a shadow, heard, she almost\r\njustified Dudley’s reproaches to her, for having made the acquaintance\r\nof the unhappy woman, for having visited her, for having been, though\r\nbut for a minute, at the mercy of a coarse gentleman’s pursuit. The\r\nrecollection was a smart buffet.\r\n\r\nHer lighted mind punished her thus through her conjuring of Dudley’s\r\nwords, should news of her relations with Mrs. Marsett reach him:--and\r\nshe would have to tell him. Would he not say: ‘I have borne with\r\nthe things concerning your family. All the greater reason why I must\r\ninsist’--he would assuredly say he insisted (her humour caught at the\r\nword, as being the very word one could foresee and clearly see him\r\nuttering in a fit of vehemence) on her immediate abandonment of ‘that\r\nwoman.’\r\n\r\nAnd with Nesta’s present enlightenment by dusky beams, upon her\r\nparentage, she listened abjectly to Dudley, or the opinion of the\r\nmajority. Would he not say or think, that her clinging to Mrs. Marsett\r\nput them under a kind of common stamp, or gave the world its option to\r\nclass them together?\r\n\r\nThese were among the ideas chasing in a head destined to be a\r\nbattle-field for the enrichment of a harvest-field of them, while the\r\ngirl’s face was hidden on Dorothea’s lap, and her breast heaved and\r\nheaved.\r\n\r\nShe distressed them when she rose, by saying she must instantly see her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThey saw the pain their hesitation inflicted, and Dorothea said: ‘Yes,\r\ndear; any day you like.’\r\n\r\n‘To-morrow--I must go to her to-morrow!’\r\n\r\nA suggestion of her mother’s coming down, was faintly spoken by one\r\nlady, echoed in a quaver by the other.\r\n\r\nNesta shook her head. To quiet the kind souls, she entreated them to\r\ngive their promise that they would invite her again.\r\n\r\nImagining the Hon. Dudley to have cast her off, both ladies embraced\r\nher: not entirely yielding-up their hearts to her, by reason of\r\nthe pernicious new ideas now in the world to sap our foundations of\r\nmorality; which warned them of their duty to uphold mentally his quite\r\njustifiable behaviour, even when compassionating the sufferings of the\r\nguiltless creature loved by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. CONTAINS DEEDS UNRELATED AND EXPOSITIONS OF FEELINGS\r\n\r\nAll through the afternoon and evening Skepsey showed indifference to\r\nmeals by continuing absent: and he was the one with whom Nesta would\r\nhave felt at home; more at home than with her parents. He and the cool\r\nworld he moved in were a transparency of peace to her mind; even to his\r\ngiving of some portion of it, when she had the dear little man present\r\nto her in a vivid image of a fish in a glass globe, wandering round and\r\nround, now and then shooting across, just as her Skepsey did: he carried\r\nhis head semihorizontally at his arrowy pace; plain to read though he\r\nwas, he appeared, under that image created of him, animated by motives\r\ninducing to speculation.\r\n\r\nShe thought of him till she could have reproached him for not returning\r\nand helping her to get away from the fever of other thoughts:--this\r\nanguish twisting about her parents, and the dreadful trammels of\r\ngratitude to a man afflictingly generous, the frown of congregated\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe latter was the least of evils; she had her charges to bring against\r\nthem for injustice: uncited, unstirred charges, they were effective as\r\na muffled force to sustain her: and the young who are of healthy lively\r\nblood and clean conscience have either emotion or imagination to fold\r\nthem defensively from an enemy world; whose power to drive them forth\r\ninto the wilderness they acknowledge. But in the wilderness their souls\r\nare not beaten down by breath of mortals; they burn straight flame there\r\nup to the parent Spirit.\r\n\r\nShe could not fancy herself flying thither;--where to be shorn and naked\r\nand shivering is no hardship, for the solitude clothes, and the sole\r\ntrue life in us resolves to that steady flame;--she was restrained by\r\nDudley’s generosity, which held her fast to have the forgiveness for\r\nher uncommitted sin dashed in her face. He surprised her; the unexpected\r\nquality in him seemed suddenly to have snared her fast: and she did not\r\nobtain release after seeing behind it;--seeing it, by the light of\r\nwhat she demanded, personal, shallow, a lover’s generosity. So her\r\nkeen intellect saw it; and her young blood (for the youthful are thus\r\ndivided) thrilled in thinking it must be love! The name of the sacred\r\npassion lifted it out of the petty cabin of the individual into a\r\nquiring cathedral universal, and subdued her. It subdued her with\r\nan unwelcome touch of tenderness when she thought of it as involving\r\ntenderness for her mother, some chivalrous respect for her mother.\r\nCould he love the daughter without some little, which a more intimate\r\nknowledge of her dear mother would enlarge? The girl’s heart flew to her\r\nmother, clung to her, vindicated her dumbly. It would not inquire, and\r\nit refused to hear, hungering the while. She sent forth her flights\r\nof stories in elucidation of the hidden; and they were like white bird\r\nafter bird winging to covert beneath a thundercloud; until her breast\r\nached for the voice of the thunder: harsh facts: sure as she was of her\r\nnever losing her filial hold of the beloved. She and her mother grew\r\ntogether, they were one. Accepting the shadow, they were the closer one\r\nbeneath it. She had neither vision nor active thought of her father, in\r\nwhom her pride was.\r\n\r\nAt the hour of ten, the ladies retired for the enjoyment of their sweet\r\nreward. Manton, their maid, came down to sit with Nesta on the watch for\r\nSkepsey. Perrin, the footman, returning, as late as twenty minutes to\r\neleven, from his tobacco promenade along the terrace, reported to Manton\r\n‘a row in town’; and he repeated to Nesta the policeman’s opinion and\r\nhis own of the ‘Army’ fellows, and the way to treat them. Both were for\r\nrigour.\r\n\r\n‘The name of “Army” attracts poor Skepsey so, I am sure he would join\r\nit, if they would admit him,’ Nesta said.\r\n\r\n‘He has an immense respect for a young woman, who belongs to his “Army”;\r\nand one doesn’t know what may have come,’ said Manton.\r\n\r\nTwo or three minutes after eleven, a feeble ring at the bell gained\r\nadmission for some person: whispering was heard in the passage.\r\n\r\nManton played eavesdropper, and suddenly bursting on Skepsey, arrested\r\nhim when about to dash upstairs. His young mistress’s voice was a\r\nsufficient command; he yielded; he pitched a smart sigh and stepped\r\ninto her presence for his countenance to be seen, or the show of a\r\ncountenance, that it presented.\r\n\r\n‘Skepsey wanted to rush to bed without saying good night to me?’ said\r\nshe; leaving unnoticed, except for woefulness of tone, his hurried\r\nshuffle of remarks on ‘his appearance,’ and ‘little accidents’; ending\r\nwith an inclination of his disgraceful person to the doorway, and a\r\npetition: ‘If I might, Miss Nesta?’ The implied pathetic reference to\r\na surgically-treated nose under a cross of strips of plaster, could not\r\nobtain dismissal for him. And he had one eye of sinister hue, showing\r\nbeside its lighted-grey fellow as if a sullen punished dragonwhelp had\r\ncouched near some quick wood-pigeon. The two eyes blinked rapidly.\r\nHe was a picture of Guilt in the nude, imploring to be sent into\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty of detaining him was evident.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, if you must,’ Nesta said. ‘But, dear Skepsey, will it be the\r\nmagistrate again to-morrow?’\r\n\r\nHe feared it would be; he fancied it would needs be. He concluded\r\nby stating, that he was bound to appear before the magistrate in the\r\nmorning; and he begged assistance to keep it from the knowledge of the\r\nMiss Duvidneys, who had been so kind to him.\r\n\r\n‘Has there been bailing of you again, Skepsey?’\r\n\r\n‘A good gentleman, a resident,’ he replied; ‘a military gentleman;\r\nindeed, a colonel of the cavalry; but, it may so be, retired; and\r\nanxious about our vast possessions; though he thinks a translation of\r\na French attack on England unimportant. He says, the Germans despise us\r\nmost.’\r\n\r\n‘Then this gentleman thinks you have a good case?’\r\n\r\n‘He is a friend of Captain Dartrey’s.’\r\n\r\nHearing that name, Nesta said: ‘Now, Skepsey, you must tell me\r\neverything. You are not to mind your looks. I believe, I do always\r\nbelieve you mean well.’\r\n\r\n‘Miss Nesta, it depends upon the magistrate’s not being prejudiced\r\nagainst the street-processionists!\r\n\r\n‘But you may expect justice from the magistrate, if your case is good?’\r\n\r\n‘I would not say no, Miss Nesta. But we find, the opinion of the public\r\nhas its effect with magistrates--their sentences. They are severe on\r\nboxing. They have latterly treated the “Army” with more consideration,\r\nowing to the change in the public view. I myself have changed.’\r\n\r\n‘Have you joined it?’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot say I am a member of it.’\r\n\r\n‘You walked in the ranks to-day, and you were maltreated? Your friend\r\nwas there?’\r\n\r\n‘I walked with Matilda Pridden; that is, parallel, along the pavement.’\r\n\r\n‘I hope she came out of it unhurt?’\r\n\r\n‘It is thanks to Captain Dartrey, Miss Nesta?’\r\n\r\nThis time Nesta looked her question.\r\n\r\nManton interposed: ‘You are to speak, Mr. Skepsey’; and she stopped a\r\nflood of narrative, that was knocking in his mind to feel its head and\r\nto leap--an uninterrupted half-minute more would have shaped the story\r\nfor the proper flow.\r\n\r\nHe began, after attending to the throb of his bruises in a manner to\r\ncorrect them rather than solace; and the beginning was the end:\r\n‘Captain Dartrey rescued us, before Matilda Pridden suffered harm, to\r\nmention--the chin, slight, teeth unshaken; a beautiful set. She is angry\r\nwith Captain Dartrey, for having recourse to violence in her defence: it\r\nis against her principles. “Then you die,” she says; and our principles\r\nare to gain more by death. She says, we are alive in them; but worse if\r\nwe abandon them for the sake of living.--I am a little confused; she is\r\nvery abstruse.--Because, that is the corruptible life, she says. I have\r\nfound it quite impossible to argue with her; she has always a complete\r\nanswer; wonderful. In case of Invasion, we are to lift our voices to the\r\nLord; and the Lord’s will shall be manifested. If we are robbed, we ask,\r\nHow came we by the goods? It is unreasonable; it strikes at rights\r\nof property. But I have to go on thinking. When in danger, she sings\r\nwithout excitement. When the blow struck her, she stopped singing only\r\nan instant. She says, no one fears, who has real faith. She will not let\r\nme call her brave. She cannot admire Captain Dartrey. Her principles are\r\nopposed. She said to him, “Sir, you did what seemed to you right.” She\r\nthinks every blow struck sends us back to the state of the beasts. Her\r\nprinciples...’\r\n\r\n‘How was it Captain Dartrey happened to be present, Skepsey?’\r\n\r\n‘She is very firm. You cannot move her.--Captain Dartrey was on his way\r\nto the station, to meet a gentleman from London, Miss Nesta. He carried\r\na stick--a remarkable stick--he had shown to me in the morning, and he\r\nhas given it me now. He says, he has done his last with it. He seems to\r\nhave some of Matilda Pridden’s ideas about fighting, when it’s over. He\r\nwas glad to be rid of the stick, he said.’\r\n\r\n‘But who attacked you? What were the people?’\r\n\r\n‘Captain Dartrey says, England may hold up her head while she breeds\r\nyoung women like Matilda Pridden: right or wrong, he says: it is the\r\nsubstance.’\r\n\r\nHereupon Manton, sick of Miss Pridden, shook the little man with\r\na snappish word, to bring him to attention. She got him together\r\nsufficiently for him to give a lame version of the story; flat until\r\nhe came to his heroine’s behaviour, when he brightened a moment, and\r\nhe sank back absorbed in her principles and theories of life. It was\r\nunderstood by Nesta, that the processionists, going at a smart pace,\r\nfound their way blocked and were assaulted in one of the sidestreets;\r\nand that Skepsey rushed to the defence of Matilda Pridden; and that,\r\nwhile they were engaged, Captain Dartrey was passing at the end of the\r\nstreet, and recognized one he knew in the thick of it and getting the\r\nworst of it, owing to numbers. ‘I will show you the stick he did it\r\nwith, Miss Nests’; said Skepsey, regardless of narrative; and darted\r\nout of the room to bring in the Demerara supple-jack; holding which, he\r\nbecame inspired to relate something of Captain Dartrey’s deeds.\r\n\r\nThey gave no pleasure to his young lady, as he sadly perceived:--thus it\r\nis with the fair sex ever, so fond of heroes! She shut her eyes from\r\nthe sight of the Demerara supple-jack descending right and left upon the\r\nskulls of a couple of bully lads. ‘That will do--you were rescued. And\r\nnow go to bed, Skepsey; and be up at seven to breakfast with me,’ Nesta\r\nsaid, for his battle-damaged face would be more endurable to behold\r\nafter an interval, she hoped; and she might in the morning dissociate\r\nits evil look from the deeds of Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\nThe thought of her hero taking active part in a streetfray, was\r\nrepulsive to her; it swamped his brilliancy. And this distressed her, by\r\nwithdrawing the support which the thought of him had been to her since\r\nmid-day. She lay for sleepless hours, while nursing a deeper pain, under\r\noppression of repugnance to battle-dealing, bloodshedding men. It was\r\nlong before she grew mindful of the absurdity of the moan recurring\r\nwhenever reflection wearied. Translated into speech, it would have run:\r\n\r\n‘In a street of the town! with a stick!’--The vulgar picture pursued her\r\nto humiliation; it robbed her or dimmed her possession of the one bright\r\nthing she had remaining to her. So she deemed it during the heavy sighs\r\nof night; partly conscious, that in some strange way it was as much\r\nas tossing her to the man who never could have condescended to the\r\npugnacious using of a stick in a street. He, on the contrary, was a\r\ncover to the shamefaced.\r\n\r\nHer heart was weak that night. She hovered above it, but not so detached\r\nas to scorn it for fawning to one--any one--who would offer her and her\r\nmother a cover from scorn. And now she exalted Dudley’s generosity,\r\nnow clung to a low idea of a haven in her father’s wealth; and she was\r\nunaware, that the second mood was deduced from the first. She did know\r\nherself cowardly: she had, too, a critic in her clear head, to spurn at\r\nthe creature who could think of purchasing the world’s respect. Dudley’s\r\ngenerosity sprang up to silence the voice. She could praise him, on a\r\nreview of it, for delicacy, moreover; and the delicacy laid her under\r\na more positive obligation. Her sense of it was not without a toneless\r\nquaint faint savour of the romantic, that her humour little humorously\r\ncaught at, to paint her a picture of former heroes of fiction, who win\r\ntheir trying lady by their perfection of good conduct on a background of\r\nhigh birth; and who are not seen to be wooden before the volume closes.\r\nHer fatigue of sleeplessness plunged her into the period of poke-bonnets\r\nand peaky hats to admire him; giving her the kind of sweetness we may\r\nimagine ourselves to get in the state of tired horse munching hay. If\r\nshe had gone to her bed with a noble or simply estimable plain image of\r\none of her friends in her heart, to sustain it, she would not have been\r\nthus abject. Skepsey’s discoloured eye, and Captain Dartrey’s behaviour\r\nbehind it, threw her upon Dudley’s generosity, as being the shield for\r\nan outcast. Girls, who see at a time of need their ideal extinguished in\r\nits appearing tarnished, are very much at the disposal of the pressing\r\nsuitor. Nesta rose in the black winter morn, summoning the best she\r\ncould think of to glorify Dudley, that she might not feel so doomed.\r\n\r\nAccording to an agreement overnight, she went to the bedroom of Dorothea\r\nand Virginia, to assure them of her having slept well, and say the\r\ngood-bye to them and their Tasso. The little dog was the growl of a\r\nsilken ball in a basket. His mistresses excused him, because of his\r\nbeing unused to the appearance of any person save Manton in their\r\nbedroom. Dorothea, kissing her, said: ‘Adieu, dear child; and there is\r\nhome with us always, remember. And, after breakfast, however it may\r\nbe, you will, for our greater feeling of security, have--she has our\r\norders--Manton--your own maid we consider too young for a guardian--to\r\naccompany you. We will not have it on our consciences, that by any\r\npossibility harm came to you while you were under our charge. The good\r\ninnocent girl we received from the hands of your father, we return to\r\nhim; we are sure of that.’\r\n\r\nNesta said: ‘Mr. Sowerby promised he would come.’\r\n\r\n‘However it may be,’ Dorothea repeated her curtaining phrase.\r\n\r\nVirginia put in a word of apology for Tasso’s temper he enjoyed\r\nordinarily a slumber of half an hour’s longer duration. He was, Dorothea\r\nfeelingly added, regularity itself. Virginia murmured: ‘Except once!’\r\nand both were appalled by the recollection of that night. It had,\r\nnevertheless, caused them to reperuse the Rev. Stuart Rem’s published\r\nbeautiful sermon ON DIRT; the words of which were an antidote to the\r\nnight of Tasso in the nostrils of Mnemosyne; so that Dorothea could\r\nreply to her sister, slightly by way of a reproval, quoting Mr. Stuart\r\nRem at his loftiest: ‘“Let us not bring into the sacred precincts\r\nDirt from the roads, but have a care to spread it where it is a\r\nfructification.”’ Virginia produced the sequent sentence, likewise\r\nweighty. Nesta stood between the thin division of their beds, her right\r\nhand given to one, her left to the other. They had the semblance of a\r\nhaven out of storms.\r\n\r\nShe reflected, after shutting the door of their room, that the residing\r\nwith them had been a means of casting her--it was an effort to remember\r\nhow--upon the world where the tree of knowledge grows. She had eaten;\r\nand she might be the worse for it; but she was raised to a height that\r\nwould not let her look with envy upon peace and comfort. Luxurious quiet\r\npeople were as ripening glass-house fruits. Her bitter gathering of the\r\nknowledge of life had sharpened her intellect; and the intellect, even\r\nin the young, is, and not less usefully, hard metal rather than fallow\r\nsoil. But for the fountain of human warmth at her breast, she might\r\nhave been snared by the conceit of intellect, to despise the simple and\r\nconventional, or shed the pity which is charity’s contempt. She had only\r\nto think of the kindness of the dear good ladies; her heart jumped to\r\nthem at once. And when she fancied hearing those innocent souls of women\r\nembracing her and reproaching her for the knowledge of life she now\r\nbore, her words down deep in her bosom were: It has helped me to bear\r\nthe shock of other knowledge! How would she have borne it before she\r\nknew of the infinitely evil? Saving for the tender compassion weeping\r\nover her mother, she had not much acute personal grief.\r\n\r\nFor this world condemning her birth, was the world tolerant of that\r\ninfinitely evil! Her intellect fortified her to be combative by\r\nday, after the night of imagination; which splendid power is not so\r\nserviceable as the logical mind in painful seasons: for night revealed\r\nthe world snorting Dragon’s breath at a girl guilty of knowing its\r\nvilest. More than she liked to recall, it had driven her scorched, half\r\nwithered, to the shelter of Dudley. The daylight, spreading thin at the\r\nwindows, restored her from that weakness. ‘We will quit England,’ she\r\nsaid, thinking of her mother and herself, and then of her father’s\r\nsurely following them. She sighed thankfully, half way through the\r\nbreakfast with Skepsey, at sight of the hour by the clock; she was\r\nhurriedly sentient of the puzzle of her feelings, when she guessed at\r\na chance that Dudley would be delayed. She supposed herself as possibly\r\nfeeling not so well able to keep every thought of her head brooding on\r\nher mother in Dudley’s company.\r\n\r\nSkepsey’s face was just sufferable by light of day, if one pitied\r\nreflecting on his honest intentions; it ceased to discolour another.\r\nHe dropped a few particulars of his hero in action; but the heroine\r\neclipsed. He was heavier than ever with his Matilda Pridden. At the\r\nhour for departure, Perrin had a conveyance at the door. Nesta sent off\r\nSkepsey with a complimentary message to Captain Dartrey. Her maid Mary\r\nbegged her to finish her breakfast; Manton suggested the waiting a\r\nfurther two or three minutes. ‘We must not be late,’ Nesta said; and\r\nwhen the minute-hand of the clock marked ample time for the drive to the\r\nstation, she took her seat and started, keeping her face resolutely\r\nset seaward, having at her ears the ring of a cry that was to come\r\nfrom Manton. But Manton was dumb; she spied no one on the pavement who\r\nsignalled to stop them. And no one was at the station to greet them.\r\nThey stepped into a carriage where they were alone. Dudley with his\r\ndreaded generosity melted out of Nesta’s thoughts, like the vanishing\r\nsteam-wreath on the dip between the line and the downs.\r\n\r\nShe passed into music, as she always did under motion of carriages and\r\ntrains, whether in happiness or sadness: and the day being one that\r\nhad a sky, the scenic of music swung her up to soar. None of her heavy\r\nburdens enchained, though she knew the weight of them, with those of\r\nother painful souls. The pipeing at her breast gave wings to large and\r\nsmall of the visible; and along the downs went stateliest of flowing\r\ndances; a copse lengthened to forest; a pool of cattle-water caught\r\ngrey for flights through enchantment. Cottage-children, wherever seen in\r\ngroups, she wreathed above with angels to watch them. Her mind all the\r\nwhile was busy upon earth, embracing her mother, eyeing her father.\r\nImagination and our earthly met midway, and still she flew, until she\r\nwas brought to the ground by a shot. She struggled to rise, uplifting\r\nJudith Marsett: a woman not so very much older than her own teens, in\r\nthe count of years, and ages older; and the world pulling at her heels\r\nto keep her low. That unhappiest had no one but a sisterly girl to help\r\nher: and how she clung to the slender help! Who else was there?\r\n\r\nThe good and the bad in the woman struck separate blows upon the\r\ngirl’s resonant nature. She perceived the good, and took it into her\r\nreflections. The bad she divined: it approached like some threat of\r\ninflammation. Natures resonant as that which animated this girl, are\r\nquick at the wells of understanding: and she had her intimations of the\r\nworld’s wisdom in withholding contagious presences from the very\r\nmangy of the young, who may not have an aim, or ideal, or strong human\r\ncompassion, for a preservative. She was assured of her possessing it.\r\nShe asked herself in her mother’s voice, and answered mutely. She had\r\nthe certainty: for she rebuked the slavish feverishness of the passion,\r\nas betrayed by Mrs. Marsett; and the woman’s tone, as of strung wires\r\nringing on a rage of the wind. Then followed her cry for the man who\r\ncould speak to Captain Marsett of his duty in honour. An image of one,\r\naccompanying the faster beats of her heart, beguiled her to think away\r\nfrom the cause. He, the one man known to her, would act the brother’s\r\npart on behalf of the hapless creature.\r\n\r\nNesta just imagined her having supplicated him, and at once imagination\r\ncame to dust. She had to thank him she knelt to him. For the first\r\ntime of her life she found herself seized with her sex’s shudder in the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. IN WHICH AGAIN WE MAKE USE OF THE OLD LAMPS FOR LIGHTING\r\nAN ABYSMAL DARKNESS\r\n\r\nAnd if Nesta had looked out of her carriage-window soon after the train\r\nbegan to glide, her eagle of imagination would have reeled from the\r\nheights, with very different feelings, earlier, perhaps a captive, at\r\nsight of the tardy gentleman rushing along the platform, and bending ear\r\nto the footman Perrin, and staring for one lost.\r\n\r\nThe snaky tail of the train imparted to Dudley an apprehension of the\r\nominous in his having missed her. It wound away, and left regrets, which\r\nraised a chorus of harsh congratulations from the opposite party of his\r\ninternal parliament.\r\n\r\nNeither party could express an opinion without rousing the other to an\r\nuproar.\r\n\r\nHe had met his cousin Southweare overnight. He had heard, that there was\r\ntalk of Miss Radnor. Her name was in the mouth of Major Worrell. It\r\nwas coupled with the name of Mrs. Marsett. A military captain, in the\r\nsuccession to be Sir Edward Marsett, bestowed on her the shadow of his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIt could be certified, that Miss Radnor visited the woman at her house.\r\nWhat are we to think of Miss Radnor, save that daughters of depraved\r\nparents!... A torture undeserved is the Centaur’s shirt for driving\r\nus to lay about in all directions. He who had swallowed so much--a\r\nthunderbolt: a still undigested discharge from the perplexing heavens\r\njumped frantic under the pressure upon him of more, and worse. A girl\r\ngetting herself talked of at a Club! And she of all young ladies should\r\nhave been the last to draw round her that buzz of tongues. On such a\r\nsubject!--The parents pursuing their career of cynical ostentation in\r\nLondon, threw an evil eye of heredity on their offspring in the egg;\r\nmaking anything credible, pointing at tendencies.\r\n\r\nAn alliance with her was impossible. So said disgust. Anger came like\r\na stronger beast, and extinguished the safety there was in the thing it\r\nconsumed, by growing so excessive as to require tempering with drops of\r\ncompassion; which prepared the way for a formal act of cold forgiveness;\r\nand the moment that was conceived, he had a passion to commit the\r\nhorrible magnanimity, and did it on a grand scale, and dissolved his\r\nHeart in the grandeur, and slaved himself again.\r\n\r\nFar from expungeing the doubt of her, forgiveness gave it a stamp and\r\nan edge. His renewed enslavement set him perusing his tyrant keenly, as\r\nnauseated captives do; and he saw, that forgiveness was beside the case.\r\nFor this Nesta Victoria Radnor would not crave it or accept it. He had\r\nmentally played the woman to her superior vivaciousness too long for him\r\nto see her taking a culprit’s attitude. What she did, she intended to\r\ndo. The mother would not have encouraged her. The father idolized her;\r\nand the father was a frank hedonist, whose blood... speculation on\r\nhorseback gallops to barren extremes. Eyes like hers--if there had not\r\nbeen the miserable dupes of girls! Conduct is the sole guide to female\r\ncharacter. That likewise may be the hypocrite’s mask.\r\n\r\nPopular artists, intent to gratify the national taste for effects called\r\nrealistic, have figured in scenes of battle the raying fragments of a\r\nman from impact of a cannon-ball on his person. Truly thus it may be\r\nwhen flesh contends. But an image of the stricken and scattered mind\r\nof the man should, though deficient in the attraction, have a greater\r\nsignificance, forasmuch as it does not exhibit him entirely liquefied\r\nand showered into space; it leaves him his legs for the taking of\r\nfurther steps. Dudley, standing on the platform of Nesta’s train, one\r\nhalf minute too late, according to his desire before he put himself in\r\nmotion, was as wildly torn as the vapour shredded streaming to fingers\r\nand threads off the upright columnar shot of the shriek from the boiler.\r\nHe wished every mad antagonism to his wishes: that he might see her, be\r\nblind to her; embrace, discard; heal his wound, and tear it wider. He\r\nthanked her for the grossness of an offence precluding excuses. He was\r\naware of a glimmer of advocacy in the very grossness. He conjured-up her\r\nfeatures, and they said, her innocence was the sinner; they scoffed at\r\nhim for the dupe he was willing to be. She had enigma’s mouth, with the\r\neyes of morning.\r\n\r\nMore than most girls, she was the girl-Sphinx to him because of her\r\nhaving ideas--or what he deemed ideas. She struck a toneing warmth\r\nthrough his intelligence, not dissimilar to the livelier circulation of\r\nthe blood in the frame breathing mountain air. She really helped\r\nhim, incited him to go along with this windy wild modern time more\r\ncheerfully, if not quite hopefully. For she had been the book of Romance\r\nhe despised when it appeared as a printed volume: and which might have\r\neducated the young man to read some among our riddles in the book of\r\nhumanity. The white he was ready to take for silver the black were all\r\nblack; the spotted had received corruption’s label. Her youthful French\r\ngoverness Mademoiselle de Seilles was also peculiarly enigmatic at the\r\nmouth conversant, one might expect, with the disintegrating literature\r\nof her country. In public, the two talked of St. Louis. One of them in\r\nsecret visits a Mrs. Marsett. The Southweare women, the Hennen women,\r\nand Lady Evelina Reddish, were artless candid creatures in their early\r\ndays, not transgressing in a glance. Lady Grace Halley had her fit of\r\nthe devotional previous to marriage. No girl known to Dudley by report\r\nor acquaintance had committed so scandalous an indiscretion as Miss\r\nRadnor’s: it pertained to the insolently vile.\r\n\r\nAnd on that ground, it started the voluble defence. For certain\r\nsuspected things will dash suspicion to the rebound, when they are\r\nvery dark. As soon as the charge against her was moderated, the defence\r\nexpired. He heard the world delivering its judgement upon her; and he\r\nsorrowfully acquiesced. She passed from him.\r\n\r\nWhen she was cut off, she sang him in the distance a remembered saying\r\nof hers, with the full melody of her voice. One day, treating of modern\r\npessimism, he had draped a cadaverous view of our mortal being in a\r\nquotation of the wisdom of the Philosopher Emperor: ‘To set one’s love\r\nupon the swallow is a futility.’ And she, weighing it, nodded, and\r\nreplied: ‘May not the pleasure for us remain if we set our love upon the\r\nbeauty of the swallow’s flight?’\r\n\r\nThere was, for a girl, a bit of idea, real idea, in that meaning, of\r\ncourse, the picture we are to have of the bird’s wings in motion, it\r\nhas often been admired. Oh! not much of an idea in itself: feminine and\r\nvague. But it was pertinent, opportune; in this way she stimulated.\r\nAnd the girl who could think it, and call on a Mrs. Marsett, was of the\r\nclass of mixtures properly to be handed over to chemical experts for\r\nanalysis!\r\n\r\nShe had her aspirations on behalf of her sex: she and Mademoiselle de\r\nSeilles discussed them; women were to do this, do that:--necessarily a\r\nmeans of instructing a girl to learn what they did do. If the lower part\r\nof her face had been as reassuring to him as the upper, he might have\r\nput a reluctant faith in the pure-mindedness of these aspirations,\r\nwithout reverting to her origin, and also to recent rumours of her\r\nfather and Lady Grace Halley. As it was, he inquired of the cognizant,\r\nwhether an intellectual precocity, devoted by preference to questions\r\naffecting the state of women, did not rather more than suggest the\r\nexistence of urgent senses likewise. She, a girl under twenty, had an\r\ninterest in public matters, and she called on a Mrs. Marsett. To plead\r\nher simplicity, was to be absolutely ignorant of her.\r\n\r\nHe neighboured sagacity when he pointed that interrogation relating\r\nto Nesta’s precociousness of the intelligence. For, as they say in\r\ndactylomancy, the ‘psychical’ of women are not disposed in their\r\nsensitive early days to dwell upon the fortunes of their sex: a thought\r\nor two turns them facing away, with the repugnant shiver. They worship\r\nat a niche in the wall. They cannot avoid imputing some share of\r\nfoulness to them that are for scouring the chamber; and the civilized\r\nmale, keeping his own chamber locked, quite shares their pale taper’s\r\nview. The full-blooded to the finger-tips, on the other hand, are likely\r\nto be drawn to the subject, by noble inducement as often as by base:\r\nNature at flood being the cause in either instance. This young Nature of\r\nthe good and the bad, is the blood which runs to power of heart as\r\nwell as to thirsts of the flesh. Then have men to sound themselves,\r\nto discover how much of Nature their abstract honourable conception or\r\nrepresentative eidolon of young women will bear without going to pieces;\r\nand it will not be much, unless they shall have taken instruction\r\nfrom the poet’s pen: for a view possibly of Nature at work to cast the\r\nslough, when they see her writhing as in her ugliest old throes. If they\r\nhave learnt of Nature’s priest to respect her, they will less distrust\r\nthose rare daughters of hers who are moved by her warmth to lift her\r\nout of slime. It is by her own live warmth that it has to be done: cold\r\nworship at a niche in the wall will not do it.--Well, there is an index,\r\nfor the enlargement of your charity.\r\n\r\nBut facts were Dudley’s teachers. Physically, morally, mentally, he\r\nread the world through facts; that is to say, through the facts he\r\nencountered: and he was in consequence foredoomed to a succession of\r\nbumps; all the heavier from his being, unlike the horned kind, not\r\nunimpressible by the hazy things outside his experience. Even at his\r\ndarkest over Nesta, it was his indigestion of the misconduct of her\r\nparents, which denied to a certain still small advocate within him\r\nthe right to raise a voice: that good fellow struck the attitude\r\nfor pleading, and had to be silent; for he was Instinct; at best a\r\nstammering speaker in the Court of the wigged Facts. Instinct of this\r\nNesta Radnor’s character would have said a brave word, but for her\r\ndeeds bearing witness to her inheritance of a lawlessly adventurous\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nWhat to do? He was no nearer to an answer when the wintry dusk had\r\nfallen on the promenading crowds. To do nothing, is the wisdom of those\r\nwho have seen fools perish. Facts had not taught him, that the doing\r\nnothing, for a length of days after the first shock he sustained, was\r\nthe reason of how it came that Nesta knitted closer her acquaintance\r\nwith the ‘agreeable lady’ she mentioned in her letter to Cronidge. Those\r\nexcellent counsellors of a mercantile community gave him no warnings,\r\nthat the ‘masterly inactive’ part, so greatly esteemed by him for the\r\nconduct of public affairs, might be perilous in dealings with a vivid\r\ngirl: nor a hint, that when facts continue undigested, it is because the\r\nsensations are as violent as hysterical females to block them from the\r\nunderstanding. His Robin Goodfellow instinct tried to be serviceable\r\nat a crux of his meditations, where Edith Averst’s consumptive brothers\r\nwaved faded hands at her chances of inheriting largely. Superb for the\r\nchances: but what of her offspring? And the other was a girl such as\r\nthe lusty Dame Dowager of fighting ancestors would have signalled to the\r\nheir of the House’s honours for the perpetuation of his race. No doubt:\r\nand the venerable Dame (beautiful in her old-lace frame, or say foliage)\r\nof the Ages backward, temp: Ed: III. inflated him with a thought of\r\nher: and his readings in modern books on heredity, pure blood, physical\r\nregeneration, pronounced approval of Nesta Radnor: and thereupon\r\ninstinct opened mouth to speak; and a lockjaw seized it under that scowl\r\nof his presiding mistrust of Nature.\r\n\r\nHe clung to his mistrust the more because of a warning he had from the\r\nsilenced natural voice: somewhat as we may behold how the Conservatism\r\nof a Class, in a world of all the evidences showing that there is no\r\nstay to things, comes of the intuitive discernment of its finality. His\r\nmistrust was his own; and Nesta was not; not yet; though a step would\r\nmake her his own. Instinct prompting to the step, was a worthless\r\nadviser. It spurred him, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHe called at the Club for his cousin Southweare, with whom he was not in\r\nsympathy; and had information that, Southweare said, ‘made the girl\r\nout all right.’ Girls in these days do things which the sainted\r\nstay-at-homes preceding them would not have dreamed of doing. Something\r\nhad occurred, relating to Major Worrell: he withdrew Miss Radnor’s name,\r\nacknowledged himself mistaken or amended his report of her, in some\r\nway, not quite intelligible. Dudley was accosted by Simeon Fenellan;\r\nsubsequently by Dartrey. There was gossip over the latter gentleman’s\r\nhaving been up before the magistrate, talk of a queer kind of stick,\r\nand Dartrey said, laughing, to Simeon: ‘Rather lucky I bled the\r\nrascal’;--whatever the meaning. She nursed one of her adorations for\r\nthis man, who had yesterday, apparently, joined in a street-fray; so she\r\npartook of the stain of the turbid defacing all these disorderly people.\r\n\r\nAt his hotel at breakfast the next morning, a newspaper furnished an\r\naccount of Captain Dartrey Fenellan’s participation in the strife, after\r\nmention of him as nephew of the Earl of Clanconan, ‘now a visitor to\r\nour town’; and his deeds were accordant with his birth. Such writing\r\nwas enough to send Dudley an eager listener to Colney Durance. What a\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nMr. Dartrey Fenellan’s card compelled Dudley presently to receive him.\r\n\r\nDartrey, not debarred by considerations, that an allusion to Miss Radnor\r\ncould be conveyed only in the most delicately obscure manner, spared him\r\nno more than the plain English of his relations with her. Requested to\r\ncome to the Club, at a certain hour of the afternoon, that he might hear\r\nMajor Worrell’s personal contradiction of scandal involving the young\r\nlady’s name, together with his apology, etc., Dudley declined: and he\r\nwas obliged to do it curtly; words were wanting. They are hard to find\r\nfor wounded sentiments rendered complex by an infusion of policy. His\r\npresent mood, with the something new to digest, held the going to Major\r\nWorrell a wrong step; he behaved as if the speaking to Dartrey Fenellan\r\npledged him hardly less. And besides he had a physical abhorrence, under\r\ndictate of moral reprobation, of the broad-shouldered sinewy man, whose\r\nlook of wiry alertness pictured the previous day’s gory gutters.\r\n\r\nDartrey set sharp eyes on him for an instant, bowed; and went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. NESTA AND HER FATHER\r\n\r\nThe day of Nesta’s return was one of a number of late when Victor\r\nwas robbed of his walk Westward by Lady Grace Halley, who seduced his\r\npoliteness with her various forms of blandishment to take a seat in her\r\ncarriage; and she was a practical speaker upon her quarter of the world\r\nwhen she had him there. Perhaps she was right in saying--though she had\r\nno right to say--that he and she together might have the world under\r\ntheir feet. It was one of those irritating suggestions which expedite\r\nus up to a bald ceiling, only to make us feel the gas-bladder’s tight\r\nextension upon emptiness: It moved him to examine the poor value of his\r\naim, by tying him to the contemptible means: One estimate involved the\r\nother, whichever came first. Somewhere he had an idea, that would\r\nlift and cleanse all degradations. But it did seem as if he were not\r\nenjoying: things pleasant enough in the passage of them were barren, if\r\nnot prickly, in the retrospect.\r\n\r\nHe sprang out at the head of the park, for a tramp round it, in the\r\ngloom of the girdle of lights, to recover his deadened relish of the\r\nthin phantasmal strife to win an intangible prize. His dulled physical\r\nsystem asked, as with the sensations of a man at the start from sleep in\r\nthe hurrying grip of steam, what on earth he wanted to get, and what was\r\nthe substance of his gains: what! if other than a precipitous intimacy,\r\na deep crumbling over deeper, with a little woman amusing him in remarks\r\nof a whimsical nudity; hardly more. Nay, not more! he said; and at the\r\nend of twenty paces, he saw much more; the campaign gathered a circling\r\nsuggestive brilliancy, like the lamps about the winter park; the\r\nSociety, lured with glitter, hooked by greed, composed a ravishing\r\npicture; the little woman was esteemed as a serviceable lieutenant; and\r\nher hand was a small soft one, agreeable to fondle--and avaunt! But so\r\nit is in war: we must pay for our allies. What if it had been, that\r\nhe and she together, with their united powers...? He dashed the silly\r\nvision aside, as vainer than one of the bubble-empires blown by boys;\r\nand it broke, showing no heart in it. His heart was Nataly’s.\r\n\r\nLet Colney hint his worst; Nataly bore the strain, always did bear any\r\nstrain coming in the round of her duties: and if she would but walk,\r\nor if she danced at parties, she would scatter the fits of despondency\r\nbesetting the phlegmatic, like this day’s breeze the morning fog; or as\r\nhe did with two minutes of the stretch of legs.\r\n\r\nFull of the grandeur of that black pit of the benighted London, with its\r\nocean-voice of the heart at beat along the lighted outer ring, Victor\r\nentered at his old door of the two houses he had knocked into one: a\r\nsurprise for Fredi!--and heard that his girl had arrived in the morning.\r\n\r\n‘And could no more endure her absence from her Mammy O!’ The songful\r\nsatirical line spouted in him, to be flung at his girl, as he ran\r\nupstairs to the boudoir off the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHe peeped in. It was dark. Sensible of presences, he gradually discerned\r\na thick blot along the couch to the right of the door, and he drew near.\r\nTwo were lying folded together; mother and daughter. He bent over them.\r\nHis hand was taken and pressed by Fredi’s; she spoke; she said tenderly:\r\n‘Father.’ Neither of the two made a movement. He heard the shivering\r\nrise of a sob, that fell. The dry sob going to the waste breath was\r\nNataly’s. His girl did not speak again.\r\n\r\nHe left them. He had no thought until he stood in his dressing-room,\r\nwhen he said ‘Good!’ For those two must have been lying folded together\r\nduring the greater part of the day: and it meant, that the mother’s\r\nheart had opened; the girl knew. Her tone: ‘Father,’ sweet, was heavy,\r\ntoo, with the darkness it came out of.\r\n\r\nSo she knew. Good. He clasped them both in his heart; tempering his pity\r\nof those dear ones with the thought, that they were of the sex which\r\nfinds enjoyment in a day of the mutual tear; and envying them; he\r\nstrained at a richness appearing in the sobs of their close union.\r\n\r\nAll of his girl’s loving soul flew to her mother; and naturally: She\r\nwould not be harsh on her father. She would say he loved! And true: he\r\ndid love, he does love; loves no woman but the dear mother.\r\n\r\nHe flicked a short wring of the hand having taken pressure from an\r\nalien woman’s before Fredi pressed it, and absolved himself in the act;\r\nthinking, How little does a woman know how true we can be to her when we\r\nsmell at a flower here and there!--There they are, stationary; women\r\nthe flowers, we the bee; and we are faithful in our seeming volatility;\r\nfaithful to the hive!--And if women are to be stationary, the reasoning\r\nis not so bad. Funny, however, if they here and there imitatively spread\r\na wing, and treat men in that way? It is a breach of the convention; we\r\npay them our homage, that they may serve as flowers, not to be volatile\r\ntempters. Nataly never had been one of the sort: Lady Grace was. No\r\nnecessity existed for compelling the world to bow to Lady Grace, while\r\non behalf of his Nataly he had to... Victor closed the curtain over a\r\ngulf-revealed by an invocation of Nature, and showing the tremendous\r\nforce he partook of so largely, in her motive elements of the\r\ndevourer. Horrid to behold, when we need a gracious presentation of the\r\ncircumstances. She is a splendid power for as long as we confine her\r\nbetween the banks: but she has a passion to discover cracks; and if we\r\ngive her headway, she will find one, and drive at it, and be through,\r\nuproarious in her primitive licentiousness, unless we labour body and\r\nsoul like Dutchmen at the dam. Here she was, and not desired, almost\r\ndetested! Nature detested! It had come about through the battle for\r\nNataly; chiefly through Mrs. Burman’s tenacious hold of the filmy thread\r\nshe took for life and was enabled to use as a means for the perversion\r\nbesides bar to the happiness of creatures really living. We may well\r\nmarvel at the Fates, and tell them they are not moral agents!\r\n\r\nVictor’s reflections came across Colney Durance, who tripped and stopped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDressed with his customary celerity, he waited for Nesta, to show her\r\nthe lighted grand double drawing-room: a further proof of how Fortune\r\nfavoured him: she was to be told, how he one day expressed a wish for\r\ngreater space, and was informed on the next, that the neighbour house\r\nwas being vacated, and the day following he was in treaty for the\r\npurchase of it; returning from Tyrol, he found his place habitable.\r\n\r\nNesta came. Her short look at him was fond, her voice not faltering; she\r\nlaid her hand under his arm and walked round the spacious room,\r\npraising the general design, admiring the porcelain, the ferns, friezes,\r\nhangings, and the grand piano, the ebony inlaid music-stands, the\r\nfiregrates and plaques, the ottomans, the tone of neutral colour that,\r\nas in sound, muted splendour. He told her it was a reception night, with\r\nmusic: and added: ‘I miss my... seen anybody lately?’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Sowerby?’ said she. ‘He was to have escorted me back. He may have\r\noverslept himself.’\r\n\r\nShe spoke it plainly; when speaking of the dear good ladies, she set\r\na gentle humour at play, and comforted him, as she intended, with a\r\nsouvenir of her lively spirit, wanting only in the manner of gaiety.\r\n\r\nHe allowed, that she could not be quite gay.\r\n\r\nMore deeply touched the next minute, he felt in her voice, in her look,\r\nin her phrasing of speech, an older, much older daughter than the Fredi\r\nwhom he had conducted to Moorsedge. ‘Kiss me,’ he said.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him full-front, and kissed his right cheek and left, and\r\nhis forehead, saying: ‘My love! my papa! my own dear dada!’ all the\r\nwords of her girlhood in her new sedateness; and smiling: like the moral\r\ncrepuscular of a sunlighted day down a not totally inanimate Sunday\r\nLonden street.\r\n\r\nHe strained her to his breast. ‘Mama soon be here?’\r\n\r\n‘Soon.’\r\n\r\nThat was well. And possibly at the present moment applying, with\r\nher cunning hand, the cosmetics and powders he could excuse for a\r\nconcealment of the traces of grief.\r\n\r\nSatisfied in being a superficial observer, he did not spy to see more\r\nthan the world would when Nataly entered the dining-room at the quiet\r\nfamily dinner. She performed her part for his comfort, though not\r\nprattling; and he missed his Fredi’s delicious warble of the prattle\r\nrunning rill-like over our daily humdrum. Simeon Fenellan would have\r\nhelped. Then suddenly came enlivenment: a recollection of news in the\r\nmorning’s paper. ‘No harm before Fredi, my dear. She’s a young woman\r\nnow. And no harm, so to speak-at least, not against the Sanfredini.\r\nShe has donned her name again, and a villa on Como, leaving her\r\n‘duque’;--paragraph from a Milanese musical Journal; no particulars.\r\nNow, mark me, we shall have her at Lakelands in the Summer. If only we\r\ncould have her now!’\r\n\r\n‘It would be a pleasure,’ said Nataly. Her heart had a blow in the\r\nthought, that a lady of this kind would create the pleasure by not\r\nbringing criticism.\r\n\r\n‘The godmother?’ he glistened upon Nesta.\r\n\r\nShe gave him low half-notes of the little blue butterfly’s imitation\r\nof the superb contralto; and her hand and head at turn to hint the\r\ntheatrical operatic attitude.\r\n\r\n‘Delicious!’ he cried, his eyelids were bedewed at the vision of the\r\nthree of them planted in the past; and here again, out of the dark wood,\r\nwhere something had required to be said, and had been said; and all\r\nwas happily over, owing to the goodness and sweetness of the two dear\r\ninnocents;--whom heaven bless! Jealousy of their naturally closer\r\nheart-at-heart, had not a whisper for him; part of their goodness and\r\nsweetness was felt to be in the not excluding him.\r\n\r\nNesta engaged to sing one of the ‘old duets with her mother. She saw her\r\nmother’s breast lift in a mechanical effort to try imaginary notes, as\r\nif doubtful of her capacity, more at home in the dumb deep sigh they\r\nfell to. Her mother’s heroism made her a sacred woman to the thoughts of\r\nthe girl, overcoming wonderment at the extreme submissiveness.\r\n\r\nShe put a screw on her mind to perceive the rational object there\r\nmight be for causing her mother to go through tortures in receiving and\r\nvisiting; and she was arrested by the louder question, whether she could\r\nthink such a man as her father irrational.\r\n\r\nPeople with resounding names, waves of a steady stream, were announced\r\nby Arlington, just as in the days, that seemed remote, before she went\r\nto Moorsedge; only they were more numerous, and some of the titles had\r\nascended a stage. There were great lords, there were many great ladies;\r\nand Lady Grace Halley shuffling amid them, like a silken shimmer in\r\nvoluminous robes.\r\n\r\nThey crowded about their host where he stood. ‘He, is their Law!’ Colney\r\nsaid, speaking unintelligibly, in the absence of the Simeon Fenellan\r\nregretted so loudly by Mr. Beaves Urmsing. They had an air of\r\nworshipping, and he of swimming.\r\n\r\nThere were also City magnates, and Lakelands’ neighbours: the gentleman\r\nrepresenting Pride of Port, Sir Abraham Quatley; and Colonel Corfe; Sir\r\nRodwell and Lady Blachington; Mrs. Fanning; Mr. Caddis. Few young\r\nmen and maids were seen. Dr. John Cormyn came without his wife, not\r\nmentioning her. Mrs. Peter Yatt touched the notes for voices at the\r\npiano. Priscilla Graves was a vacancy, and likewise the Rev. Septimus\r\nBarmby. Peridon and Catkin, and Mr. Pempton took their usual places.\r\nThere was no fluting. A famous Canadian lady was the principal singer.\r\nA Galician violinist, zig-zagging extreme extensions and contractions of\r\nhis corporeal frame in execution, and described by Colney as ‘Paganini\r\non wall,’ failed to supplant Durandarte in Nesta’s memory. She was asked\r\nby Lady Grace for the latest of Dudley. Sir Abraham Quatley named him\r\nwith handsome emphasis. Great dames caressed her; openly approved;\r\nshadowed the future place among them.\r\n\r\nVictor alluded at night to Mrs. John Cormyn’s absence. He said: ‘A\r\nhomoeopathic doctor’s wife!’ nothing more; and by that little, he\r\nprepared Nesta for her mother’s explanation. The great London people,\r\nignorant or not, were caught by the strong tide he created, and carried\r\non it. But there was a bruiting of the secret among their set; and the\r\none to fall away from her, Nataly marvellingly named Mrs. John Cormyn;\r\nwhose marriage was of her making. She did not disapprove Priscilla’s\r\nbehaviour. Priscilla had come to her and, protesting affection, had\r\nopenly stated, that she required time and retirement to recover her\r\nproper feelings. Nataly smiled a melancholy criticism of an inconsequent\r\nor capricious woman, in relating to Nesta certain observations Priscilla\r\nhad dropped upon poor faithful Mr. Pempton, because of his concealment\r\nfrom her of his knowledge of things for this faithful gentleman had been\r\none of the few not ignorant. The rumour was traceable to the City.\r\n\r\n‘Mother, we walk on planks,’ Nesta said.\r\n\r\nNataly answered: ‘You will grow used to it.’\r\n\r\nHer mother’s habitual serenity in martyrdom was deceiving. Nesta had a\r\ntransient suspicion, that she had grown, from use, to like the whirl of\r\ncompany, for oblivion in the excitement; and as her remembrance of her\r\nown station among the crowding people was a hot flush, the difference of\r\ntheir feelings chilled her.\r\n\r\nNataly said: ‘It is to-morrow night again; we do not rest.’ She smiled;\r\nand at once the girl read woman’s armour on the dear face, and asked\r\nherself, Could I be so brave? The question following was a speechless\r\nwave, that surged at her father. She tried to fathom the scheme he\r\nentertained. The attempt obscured her conception of the man he was.\r\nShe could not grasp him, being too young for knowing, that young heads\r\ncannot obtain a critical hold upon one whom they see grandly succeeding\r\nit is the sun’s brilliance to their eyes.\r\n\r\nMother and daughter slept together that night, and their embrace was\r\ntheir world.\r\n\r\nNesta delighted her father the next day by walking beside him into the\r\nCity, as far as the end of the Embankment, where the carriage was in\r\nwaiting with her maid to bring her back; and at his mere ejaculation\r\nof a wish, the hardy girl drove down in the afternoon for the walk home\r\nwith him. Lady Grace Halley was at the office. ‘I’m an incorrigible\r\nStock Exchange gambler,’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Only,’ Victor bade her beware, ‘Mines are undulating in movement, and\r\ntheir heights are a preparation for their going down.’\r\n\r\nShe said she ‘liked a swing.’\r\n\r\nNesta looked at them in turn.\r\n\r\nThe day after and the day after, Lady Grace was present. She made play\r\nwith Dudley’s name.\r\n\r\nThis coming into the City daily of a girl, for the sake of walking back\r\nin winter weather with her father, struck her as ambiguous: either a\r\njealous foolish mother’s device, or that of a weak man beating about\r\nfor protection. But the woman of the positive world soon read to the\r\ncontrary; helped a little by the man, no doubt. She read rather too much\r\nto the contrary, and took the pedestrian girl for perfect simplicity in\r\nher tastes, when Nesta had so far grown watchful as to feel relieved by\r\nthe lady’s departure. Her mother, without sympathy for the lady, was too\r\ngreat of soul for jealousy. Victor had his Nataly before him at a hint\r\nfrom Lady Grace: and he went somewhat further than the exact degree\r\nwhen affirming, that Nataly could not scheme, and was incapable of\r\nsuspecting.--Nataly could perceive things with a certain accuracy: she\r\nwould not stoop to a meanness. ‘Plot? Nataly?’ said he, and shrugged.\r\nIn fact, the void of plot, drama, shuffle of excitement, reflected upon\r\nNataly. He might have seen as tragic as ever dripped on Stage, had he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\nBut the walk Westward with his girl, together with pride in a daughter\r\nwho clove her way through all weathers, won his heart to exultation. He\r\ntold her: ‘Fredi does her dada so much good’; not telling her in what,\r\nor opening any passage to the mystery of the man he was. She was trying\r\nto be a student of life, with her eyes down upon hard earth, despite\r\nof her winged young head; she would have compassed him better had he\r\ndilated in sublime fashion; but he baffled her perusal of a man of\r\npower by the simpleness of his enjoyment of small things coming in his\r\nway;--the lighted shops, the crowd, emergence from the crowd, or the\r\nmeeting near midwinter of a soft warm wind along the Embankment, and\r\ndark Thames magnificently coroneted over his grimy flow. There is no\r\ngrasping of one who quickens us.\r\n\r\nHis flattery of his girl, too, restored her broken feeling of personal\r\nvalue; it permeated her nourishingly from the natural breath of him that\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nAt times he touched deep in humaneness; and he set her heart leaping on\r\nthe flash of a thought to lay it bare, with the secret it held, for his\r\nhelp. That was a dream. She could more easily have uttered the words\r\nto Captain Dartrey, after her remembered abashing holy tremour of\r\nthe vision of doing it and casting herself on noblest man’s\r\ncompassionateness; and her imagined thousand emotions;--a rolling music\r\nwithin her, a wreath of cloudglory in her sky;--which had, as with\r\nvirgins it may be, plighted her body to him for sheer urgency of soul;\r\ndrawn her by a single unwitting-to-brain, conscious-in-blood, shy curl\r\noutward of the sheathing leaf to the flowering of woman to him; even to\r\nthe shore of that strange sea, where the maid stands choosing this one\r\nman for her destiny, as in a trance. So are these young ones unfolded,\r\nshade by shade; and a shade is all the difference with them; they can\r\nteach the poet to marvel at the immensity of vitality in ‘the shadow of\r\na shade.’\r\n\r\nHer father shut the glimpse of a possible speaking to him of Mrs.\r\nMarsett, with a renewal of his eulogistic allusions to Dudley Sowerby:\r\nthe ‘perfect gentleman, good citizen’; prospective heir to an earldom\r\nbesides. She bowed to Dudley’s merits; she read off the honorific\r\npedimental letters of a handsome statue, for a sign to herself that she\r\npassed it.\r\n\r\nShe was unjust, as Victor could feel, though he did not know how\r\ncoldly unjust. For among the exorbitant requisitions upon their\r\nfellow-creatures made by the young, is the demand, that they be\r\ndefinite: no mercy is in them for the transitional. And Dudley--and it\r\nwas under her influence, and painfully, not ignobly--was in process of\r\ndevelopment: interesting to philosophers, if not to maidens.\r\n\r\nVictor accused her of paying too much heed to Colney Durance’s epigrams\r\nupon their friends. He quite joined with his English world in its\r\nopinion, that epigrams are poor squibs when they do not come out of\r\ngreat guns. Epigrams fired at a venerable nation, are surely the poorest\r\nof popgun paper pellets. The English kick at the insolence, when\r\nthey are not in the mood for pelleting themselves, or when the armed\r\nForeigner is overshadowing and braceing. Colney’s pretentious and\r\nlaboured Satiric Prose Epic of ‘THE RIVAL TONGUES,’ particularly\r\noffended him, as being a clever aim at no hitting; and sustained him,\r\ninasmuch as it was an acid friend’s collapse. How could Colney expect\r\nhis English to tolerate such a spiteful diatribe! The suicide of Dr.\r\nBouthoin at San Francisco was the finishing stroke to the chances of\r\nsuccess of the Serial;--although we are promised splendid evolutions on\r\nthe part of Mr. Semhians; who, after brilliant achievements with bat\r\nand ball, abandons those weapons of Old England’s modern renown, for a\r\ndetermined wrestle with our English pronunciation of words, and rescue\r\nof the spelling of them from the printer. His headache over the present\r\ntreatment of the verb ‘To bid,’ was a quaint beginning for one who had\r\nsoon to plead before Japanese, and who acknowledged now ‘in contrition\r\nof spirit,’ that in formerly opposing the scheme for an Academy, he\r\nhelped to the handing of our noble language to the rapid reporter of\r\nnews for an apathetic public. Further, he discovered in astonishment the\r\nsubordination of all literary Americans to the decrees of their literary\r\nauthorities; marking a Transatlantic point of departure, and contrasting\r\nominously with the unruly Islanders ‘grunting the higgledy-piggledy of\r\ntheir various ways, in all the porker’s gut-gamut at the rush to the\r\ntrough.’ After a week’s privation of bat and ball, he is, lighted or\r\nnot, a gas-jet of satire upon his countrymen. As for the ‘pathetic\r\nsublimity of the Funeral of Dr. Bouthoin,’ Victor inveighed against\r\nan impious irony in the over dose of the pathos; and the same might\r\nbe suspected in Britannia’s elegy upon him, a strain of hot eulogy\r\nthroughout. Mr. Semhians, all but treasonably, calls it, Papboat and\r\nBrandy:--‘our English literary diet of the day’: stimulating and\r\nnot nourishing. Britannia’s mournful anticipation, that ‘The shroud\r\nenwinding this my son is mine!’--should the modern generation depart\r\nfrom the track of him who proved himself the giant in mainly supporting\r\nher glory--was, no doubt, a high pitch of the note of Conservatism. But\r\nconsidering, that Dr. Bouthoin ‘committed suicide under a depression\r\nof mind produced by a surfeit of unaccustomed dishes, upon a physical\r\nsystem inspired by the traditions of exercise, and no longer relieved by\r\nthe practice’--to translate from Dr. Gannius: we are again at war with\r\nthe writer’s reverential tone, and we know not what to think: except,\r\nthat Mr. Durance was a Saturday meat market’s butcher in the Satiric\r\nArt.\r\n\r\nNesta found it pleasanter to see him than to hear of his work: which,\r\nto her present feeling, was inhuman. As little as our native public, had\r\nshe then any sympathy for the working in the idea: she wanted throbs,\r\nvisible aims, the Christian incarnate; she would have preferred the tale\r\nof slaughter--periodically invading all English classes as a flush from\r\nthe undrained lower, Vikings all--to frigid sterile Satire. And truly\r\nit is not a fruit-bearing rod. Colney had to stand on the defence of\r\nit against the damsel’s charges. He thought the use of the rod, while\r\nexpressing profound regret at a difference of opinion between him and\r\nthose noble heathens, beneficial for boys; but in relation to their\r\nseniors, and particularly for old gentlemen, he thought that the\r\nsharpest rod to cut the skin was the sole saving of them. Insensibility\r\nto Satire, he likened to the hard-mouthed horse; which is doomed to the\r\nworser thing in consequence. And consequently upon the lack of it, and\r\nof training to appreciate it, he described his country’s male venerables\r\nas being distinguishable from annuitant spinsters only in presenting\r\nthemselves forked.\r\n\r\n‘He is unsuccessful and embittered, Victor said to Nesta. ‘Colney will\r\nfind in the end, that he has lost his game and soured himself by never\r\nmaking concessions. Here’s this absurd Serial--it fails, of course;\r\nand then he has to say, it’s because he won’t tickle his English, won’t\r\nenter into a “frowzy complicity” with their tastes.’\r\n\r\n‘But--I think of Skepsey honest creatures respect Mr. Durance, and he is\r\nalways ready to help them,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘If he can patronize.’\r\n\r\n‘Does he patronize me, dada?’\r\n\r\n‘You are one of his exceptions. Marry a title and live in state--and\r\nthen hear him! I am successful, and the result of it is, that he won’t\r\nacknowledge wisdom in anything I say or do; he will hardly acknowledge\r\nthe success. It is “a dirty road to success,” he says. So that, if\r\nsuccessful, I must have rolled myself in mire. I compelled him to\r\nadmit he was wrong about your being received at Moorsedge: a bit of a\r\ntriumph!’\r\n\r\nNesta’s walks with her father were no loss of her to Nataly; the girl\r\ncame back to her bearing so fresh and so full a heart; and her father\r\nwas ever prouder of her: he presented new features of her in his\r\nquotations of her sayings, thoughtful sayings. ‘I declare she helps one\r\nto think,’ he said. ‘It ‘s not precocity; it ‘s healthy inquiry. She\r\nbrings me nearer ideas of my own, not yet examined, than any one else\r\ndoes. I say, what a wife for a man!’\r\n\r\n‘She takes my place beside you, dear, now I am not quite strong,’ said\r\nNataly. ‘You have not seen...?’\r\n\r\n‘Dudley Sowerby? He’s at Cronidge, I believe. His elder brother’s in a\r\nbad way. Bad business, this looking to a death.’\r\n\r\nNataly eyes revealed a similar gulf.\r\n\r\nLet it be cast on Society, then! A Society opposing Nature forces us\r\nto these murderous looks upon impediments. But what of a Society in the\r\ndance with Nature? Victor did not approve of that. He began, under the\r\ninfluence of Nesta’s companionship, to see the Goddess Nature there is\r\nin a chastened nature. And this view shook the curtain covering his lost\r\nIdea. He felt sure he should grasp it soon and enter into its daylight:\r\na muffled voice within him said, that he was kept waiting to do so by\r\nthe inexplicable tardiness of a certain one to rise ascending to her\r\nspiritual roost. She was now harmless to strike: Themison, Carling,\r\nJarniman, even the Rev. Groseman Buttermore, had been won to the cause\r\nof humanity. Her ascent, considering her inability to do further harm\r\nbelow, was most mysteriously delayed. Owing to it, in a manner almost as\r\nmysterious, he was kept crossing a bridge having a slippery bit on it.\r\nThanks to his gallant Fredi, he had found his feet again. But there was\r\na bruise where, to his honour, he felt tenderest. And Fredi away, he\r\nmight be down again--for no love of a slippery bit, proved slippery,\r\none might guess, by a predecessor or two. Ta-ta-ta-to and mum! Still, in\r\njustice to the little woman, she had been serviceable.\r\n\r\nShe would be still more so, if a member of Parliament now on his back\r\nhere we are with the murder-eye again!\r\n\r\nNesta’s never speaking of Lakelands clouded him a little, as an\r\nintimation of her bent of mind.\r\n\r\n‘And does my girl come to her dada to-day?’ he said, on the fifth\r\nmorning since her return; prepared with a villanous resignation to hear,\r\nthat this day she abstained, though he had the wish for her coming.\r\n\r\n‘Why, don’t you know,’ said she, ‘we all meet to have tea in Mr.\r\nDurance’s chambers; and I walk back with you, and there we are joined by\r\nmama; and we are to have a feast of literary celebrities.’\r\n\r\n‘Colney’s selection of them! And Simeon Fenellan, I hope. Perhaps\r\nDartrey. Perhaps... eh?’\r\n\r\nShe reddened. So Dudley Sowerby’s unspoken name could bring the blush\r\nto her cheeks. Dudley had his excuses in his brother’s condition. His\r\nfather’s health, too, was--but this was Dudley calculating. Where there\r\nare coronets, calculations of this sort must needs occur; just as where\r\nthere are complications. Odd, one fancies it, that we walking along the\r\npavement of civilized life, should be perpetually summoning Orcus to our\r\naid, for the sake of getting a clear course.\r\n\r\n‘And supposing a fog, my dearie?’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘The daughter in search of her father carries a lamp to light her to him\r\nthrough densest fogs as well as over deserts,’ etc. She declaimed a long\r\nsentence, to set the ripple running in his features; and when he left\r\nthe room for a last word with Armandine, she flung arms round her\r\nmother’s neck, murmuring: ‘Mother! mother!’ a cry equal to ‘I am sure I\r\ndo right,’ and understood so by Nataly approving it; she too on the line\r\nof her instinct, without an object in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. THE MOTHER-THE DAUGHTER\r\n\r\nTaking Nesta’s hand, on her entry into his chambers with her father,\r\nColney Durance bowed over it and kissed it. The unusual performance\r\nhad a meaning; she felt she was praised. It might be because she made\r\nherself her father’s companion. ‘I can’t persuade him to put on a\r\ngreat-coat,’ she said. ‘You would defeat his aim at the particular\r\nwaistcoat of his ambition,’ said Colney, goaded to speak, not anxious to\r\nbe heard.\r\n\r\nHe kept her beside him, leading her about for introductions to multiform\r\ncelebrities of both sexes; among them the gentleman editing the Magazine\r\nwhich gave out serially THE RIVAL TONGUES: and there was talk of a\r\ndragon-throated public’s queer appetite in Letters. The pained Editor\r\ndeferentially smiled at her cheerful mention of Delphica. ‘In, book\r\nform, perhaps!’ he remarked, with plaintive’ resignation; adding: ‘You\r\nread it?’ And a lady exclaimed: ‘We all read it!’\r\n\r\nBut we are the elect, who see signification and catch flavour; and we\r\nare reminded of an insatiable monster how sometimes capricious is his\r\ngorge. ‘He may happen to be in the humour for a shaking!’ Colney’s poor\r\nconsolation it was to say of the prospects of his published book: for\r\nthe funny monster has been known to like a shaking.\r\n\r\n‘He takes it kinder tickled,’ said Fenellan, joining the group and\r\ngrasping Nesta’s hand with a warmth that thrilled her and set her\r\nguessing. ‘A taste of his favourite Cayenne lollypop, Colney; it fetches\r\nthe tear he loves to shed, or it gives him digestive heat in the bag of\r\nhis literary receptacle-fearfully relaxed and enormous! And no wonder;\r\nhis is to lie him down on notion of the attitude for reading, his back;\r\nand he has in a jiffy the funnel of the Libraries inserted into his\r\nmouth, and he feels the publishers pouring their gallons through it\r\nunlimitedly; never crying out, which he can’t; only swelling, which\r\nhe’s obliged to do, with a non-nutritious inflation; and that’s his\r\nintellectual enjoyment; bearing a likeness to the horrible old torture\r\nof the baillir d’eau; and he’s doomed to perish in the worst book-form\r\nof dropsy. You, my dear Colney, have offended his police or excise, who\r\nstand by the funnel, in touch with his palate, to make sure that nothing\r\nabove proof is poured in; and there’s your misfortune. He’s not half a\r\nbad fellow, you find when you haven’t got to serve him.’\r\n\r\n‘Superior to his official parasites, one supposes!’ Colney murmured.\r\n\r\nThe celebrities were unaffectedly interested in a literary failure\r\nhaving certain merits; they discussed it, to compliment the crownless\r\nauthor; and the fervider they, the more was he endowed to read the\r\nmeanness prompting the generosity. Publication of a book, is the\r\nphilosopher’s lantern upon one’s fellows.\r\n\r\nColney was caught away from his private manufactory of acids by hearing\r\nSimeon Fenellan relate to Victor some of the recent occurrences at\r\nBrighton. Simeon’s tone was unsatisfying; Colney would have the word;\r\nhe was like steel on the grindstone for such a theme of our national\r\ngrotesque-sublime.\r\n\r\n‘That Demerara Supple-jack, Victor! Don’t listen to Simeon; he’s a man\r\nof lean narrative, fit to chronicle political party wrangles and\r\nsuch like crop of carcase prose: this is epical. In DRINK we have Old\r\nEngland’s organic Epic; Greeks and Trojans; Parliamentary Olympus,\r\nennobled brewers, nasal fanatics, all the machinery to hand. Keep a\r\nstraight eye on the primary motives of man, you’ll own the English\r\nproduce the material for proud verse; they’re alive there! Dartrey’s\r\nDemerara makes a pretty episode of the battle. I haven’t seen it--if\r\nit’s possible to look on it: but I hear it is flexible, of a vulgar\r\nappearance in repose, Jove’s lightning at one time, the thong of AEacus\r\nat another. Observe Dartrey marching off to the Station, for the purpose\r\nof laying his miraculous weapon across the shoulders of a son of Mars,\r\nwho had offended. But we have his name, my dear Victor! His name,\r\nSimeon?--Worrell; a Major Worrell: his offence being probably, that\r\nhe obtained military instruction in the Service, and left it at his\r\nconvenience, for our poor patch and tatter British Army to take in\r\nhis place another young student, who’ll grow up to do similarly. And\r\nDartrey, we assume, is off to stop that system. You behold Sir Dartrey\r\ntwirling the weapon in preparatory fashion; because he is determined\r\nwe shall have an army of trained officers instead of infant amateurs\r\nheading heroic louts. Not a thought of Beer in Dartrey!--always\r\nunpatriotic, you ‘ll say. Plato entreats his absent mistress to fix eyes\r\non a star: eyes on Beer for the uniting of you English! I tell you no\r\npoetic fiction. Seeing him on his way, thus terribly armed, and knowing\r\nhis intent, Venus, to shield a former favourite servant of Mars,\r\nconjured the most diverting of interventions, in the shape of a young\r\nwoman in a poke-bonnet, and Skepsey, her squire, marching with a\r\ndozen or so, informing bedevilled mankind of the hideousness of our\r\nhymnification when it is not under secluding sanction of the Edifice,\r\nand challengeing criticism; and that was hard by, and real English,\r\nin the form of bludgeons, wielded by a battalion of the national idol\r\nBungay Beervat’s boys; and they fell upon the hymners. Here you fill in\r\nwith pastoral similes. They struck the maid adored by Skepsey. And that\r\nwas the blow which slew them! Our little man drove into the press with\r\na pair of fists able to do their work. A valiant skiff upon a sea\r\nof enemies, he was having it on the nob, and suddenly the Demerara\r\nlightened. It flailed to thresh. Enough to say, brains would have come.\r\nThe Bungays made a show of fight. No lack of blood in them, to stock a\r\nraw shilling’s worth or gush before Achilles rageing. You perceive the\r\npicture, you can almost sing the ballad. We want only a few names of\r\nthe fallen. It was the carving of a maitre chef, according to Skepsey:\r\nright-left-and point, with supreme precision: they fell, accurately\r\nsliced from the joint. Having done with them, Dartrey tossed the\r\nDemerara to Skepsey, and washed his hands of battle; and he let his\r\nmajor go unscathed. Phlebotomy sufficient for the day!’\r\n\r\nNesta’s ears hummed with the name of Major Worrell.\r\n\r\n‘Skepsey did come back to London with a rather damaged frontispiece,’\r\nVictor said. ‘He can’t have joined those people?’\r\n\r\n‘They may suit one of your militant peacemakers,’ interposed Fenellan.\r\n‘The most placable creatures alive, and the surest for getting-up a\r\nshindy.’\r\n\r\n‘Suit him! They’re the scandal of our streets.’ Victor was pricked with\r\na jealousy of them for beguiling him of his trusty servant.\r\n\r\n‘Look at your country, see where it shows its vitality,’ said Colney.\r\n‘You don’t see elsewhere any vein in movement-movement,’ he harped on\r\nthe word Victor constantly employed to express the thing he wanted\r\nto see. ‘Think of that, when the procession sets your teeth on\r\nedge. They’re honest foes of vice, and they move:--in England!\r\nPulpit-preaching has no effect. For gross maladies, gross remedies.\r\nYou may judge of what you are by the quality of the cure. Puritanism, I\r\nwon’t attempt to paint--it would barely be decent; but compare it with\r\nthe spectacle of English frivolity, and you’ll admit it to be the best\r\nshow you make. It may still be the saving of you--on the level of the\r\norderly ox: I ‘ve not observed that it aims at higher. And talking of\r\nthe pulpit, Barmby is off to the East, has accepted a Shoreditch curacy,\r\nSkepsey tells me.’\r\n\r\n‘So there’s the reason for our not seeing him!’ Victor turned to Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘Papa, you won’t be angry with Skepsey if he has joined those people,’\r\nsaid Nesta. ‘I’m sure he thinks of serving his country, Mr. Durance.’\r\n\r\nColney smiled on her. ‘And you too?’\r\n\r\n‘If women knew how!’\r\n\r\n‘They’re hitting on more ways at present than the men--in England.’\r\n\r\n‘But, Mr. Durance, it speaks well for England when they’re allowed the\r\nchance here.’\r\n\r\n‘Good!’ Fenellan exclaimed. ‘And that upsets his placement of the modern\r\nnational genders: Germany masculine, France feminine, Old England what\r\nremains.’\r\n\r\nVictor ruffled and reddened on his shout of ‘Neuter?’\r\n\r\nTheir circle widened. Nesta knew she was on promotion, by her being led\r\nabout and introduced to ladies. They were encouraging with her. One of\r\nthem, a Mrs. Marina Floyer, had recently raised a standard of feminine\r\ninsurrection. She said: ‘I hear your praises from Mr. Durance. He rarely\r\npraises. You have shown capacity to meditate on the condition of women,\r\nhe says.’\r\n\r\nNesta drew a shorter breath, with a hope at heart. She speculated in the\r\ndark, as to whether her aim to serve and help was not so friendless. And\r\ndid Mr. Durance approve? But surely she stood in a glorious England if\r\nthere were men and women to welcome a girl to their councils. Oh! that\r\nis the broad free England where gentlemen and gentlewomen accept of the\r\nmeanest aid to cleanse the land of its iniquities, and do not suffer\r\nshame to smite a young face for touching upon horrors with a pure\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nShe cried in her bosom: I feel! She had no other expression for that\r\nwhich is as near as great natures may come to the conceiving of the\r\ncelestial spirit from an emissary angel; and she trembled, the fire ran\r\nthrough her. It seemed to her, that she would be called to help or that\r\ncertainly they were nearing to an effacement of the woefullest of evils;\r\nand if not helping, it would still be a blessedness for her to kneel\r\nthanking heaven.\r\n\r\nSociety was being attacked and defended. She could but studiously\r\nlisten. Her father was listening. The assailant was a lady; and she had\r\na hearing, although she treated Society as a discrowned monarch on trial\r\nfor an offence against a more precious: viz., the individual cramped\r\nby brutish laws: the individual with the ideas of our time, righteously\r\nclaiming expansion out of the clutches of a narrow old-world\r\ndisciplinarian-that giant hypocrite! She flung the gauntlet at\r\nexternally venerable Institutions; and she had a hearing, where\r\nhorrification, execration, the foul Furies of Conservatism would in a\r\nshortly antecedent day have been hissing and snakily lashing, hounding\r\nher to expulsion. Mrs. Marina Floyer gravely seconded her. Colney did\r\nthe same. Victor turned sharp on him. ‘Yes,’ Colney said; ‘we unfold the\r\nstandard of extremes in this country, to get a single step taken: that’s\r\nhow we move: we threaten death to get footway. Now, mark: Society’s\r\nerrors will be admitted.’\r\n\r\nA gentleman spoke. He began by admitting Society’s errors. Nevertheless,\r\nit so distinctly exists for the common good, that we may say of Society\r\nin relation to the individual, it is the body to the soul. We may\r\nwash, trim, purify, but we must not maim it. The assertion of our\r\nindividuality in opposition to the Government of Society--this existing\r\nSociety--is a toss of the cap for the erasure of our civilization, et\r\ncaetera.\r\n\r\nPlatitudes can be of intense interest if they approach our case.--But,\r\nif you please, we ask permission to wash, trim, purify, and we do not\r\nget it.--But you have it! Because we take it at our peril; and you, who\r\nare too cowardly to grant or withhold, call-up the revolutionary from\r\nthe pits by your slackness:--etc. There was a pretty hot debate. Both\r\nassailant and defendant, to Victor’s thinking, spoke well, and each\r\nthe right thing and he could have made use of both, but he could answer\r\nneither. He beat about for the cause of this deficiency, and discovered\r\nit in his position. Mentally, he was on the side of Society. Yet he was\r\nannoyed to find the attack was so easily answerable when the defence\r\nunfolded. But it was absurd to expect it would not be. And in fact,\r\na position secretly rebellious is equal to water on the brain for\r\nstultifying us.\r\n\r\nBefore the controversy was over, a note in Nataly’s handwriting called\r\nhim home. She wrote: ‘Make my excuses. C. D. will give Nesta and some\r\nlady dinner. A visitor here. Come alone, and without delay. Quite well,\r\nrobust. Impatient to consult with you, nothing else.’\r\n\r\nNesta was happy to stay; and Victor set forth.\r\n\r\nThe visitor? plainly Dudley. Nataly’s trusting the girl to the chance of\r\nsome lady being present, was unlike her. Dudley might be tugging at the\r\ncord; and the recent conversation upon Society, rendered one of its gilt\r\npillars particularly estimable.--A person in the debate had declared\r\nthis modern protest on behalf of individualism to represent Society’s\r\nCriminal Trial. And it is likely to be a long one. And good for the\r\nworld, that we see such a Trial!--Well said or not, undoubtedly Society\r\nis an old criminal: not much more advanced than the state of spiritual\r\nworship where bloody sacrifice was offered to a hungry Lord. But it has\r\na case for pleading. We may liken it, as we have it now, to the\r\nbumping lumberer’s raft; suitable along torrent waters until we come to\r\nsmoother. Are we not on waters of a certain smoothness at the reflecting\r\nlevel?--enough to justify demands for a vessel of finer design. If\r\nSociety is to subsist, it must have the human with the logical argument\r\nagainst the cry of the free-flags, instead of presenting a block’s\r\nobtuseness. That, you need not hesitate to believe, will be rolled\r\ndownward and disintegrated, sooner than later. A Society based on the\r\nlogical concrete of humane considerateness:--a Society prohibiting to\r\nMrs. Burman her wielding of a life-long rod....\r\n\r\nThe personal element again to confuse inquiry!--And Skepsey and Barmby\r\nboth of them bent on doing work without inquiry of any sort! They were\r\nenviable: they were good fellows. Victor clung to the theme because it\r\nhinted of next door to his lost Idea. He rubbed the back of his head,\r\nfancying a throb there. Are civilized creatures incapable of abstract\r\nthought when their social position is dubious? For if so, we never can\r\nbe quit of those we forsake.--Apparently Mrs. Burman’s unfathomed power\r\nlay in her compelling him to summon the devilish in himself and play\r\nupon the impish in Society, that he might overcome her.\r\n\r\nVictor’s house-door stopped this current.\r\n\r\nNataly took his embrace.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing wrong?’ he said, and saw the something. It was a favourable\r\nmoment to tell her what she might not at another time regard as a small\r\naffair. ‘News in the City to-day of that South London borough being\r\nvacated. Quatley urges me. A death again! I saw Pempton, too. Will you\r\ncredit me when I tell you he carries his infatuation so far, that he\r\nhas been investing in Japanese and Chinese Loans, because they are less\r\nmeat-eaters than others, and vegetarians are more stable, and outlast us\r\nall!--Dudley the visitor?’ ‘Mr. Sowerby has been here,’ she said, in a\r\nshaking low voice.\r\n\r\nVictor held her hand and felt a squeeze more nervous than affectionate.\r\n\r\n‘To consult with me,’ she added. ‘My maid will go at ten to bring Nesta;\r\nMr. Durance I can count on, to see her safe home. Ah!’ she wailed.\r\n\r\nVictor nodded, saying: ‘I guess. And, my love, you will receive Mrs.\r\nJohn Cormyn to-morrow morning. I can’t endure gaps. Gaps in our circle\r\nmust never be. Do I guess?--I spoke to Colney about bringing her home.’\r\n\r\nNataly sighed: ‘Ah! make what provision we will! Evil--Mr. Sowerby has\r\nhad a great deal to bear.’\r\n\r\n‘A worldling may think so.’\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved, and the wave burst: but her restraining of tears\r\nfroze her speech.\r\n\r\n‘Victor! Our Nesta! Mr. Sowerby is unable to explain. And how the\r\nMiss Duvidneys!... At that Brighton!’--The voice he heard was not his\r\ndarling’s deep rich note, it had dropped to toneless hoarseness: ‘She\r\nhas been permitted to make acquaintance--she has been seen riding\r\nwith--she has called upon--Oh! it is one of those abandoned women. In\r\nher house! Our girl! Our Nesta! She was insulted by a man in the woman’s\r\nhouse. She is talked of over Brighton. The mother!--the daughter! And\r\ngrant me this--that never was girl more carefully... never till she was\r\ntaken from me. Oh! do not forget. You will defend me? You will say,\r\nthat her mother did with all her soul strive... It is not a rumour. Mr.\r\nSowerby has had it confirmed.’ A sob caught her voice.\r\n\r\nVictor’s hands caressed to console: ‘Dudley does not propose to...?’\r\n\r\n‘Nesta must promise... but how it happened? How! An acquaintance\r\nwith--contact with!--Oh! cruel!’ Each time she ceased speaking, the\r\nwrinkles of a shiver went over her, and the tone was of tears coming,\r\nbut she locked them in.\r\n\r\n‘An accident!’ said Victor; ‘some misunderstanding--there can’t be\r\nharm. Of course, she promises--hasn’t to promise. How could a girl\r\ndistinguish! He does not cast blame on her?’\r\n\r\n‘Dear, if you would go down to Dartrey to-morrow. He knows:--it is over\r\nthe Clubs there; he will tell you, before a word to Nesta. Innocent,\r\nyes! Mr. Sowerby has not to be assured of that. Ignorant of the\r\ncharacter of the dreadful woman? Ah, if I could ever in anything think\r\nher ignorant! She frightens me. Mr. Sowerby is indulgent. He does\r\nme justice. My duty to her--I must defend myself--has been my first\r\nthought. I said in my prayers--she at least!... We have to see the more\r\nthan common reasons why she, of all girls, should--he did not hint it,\r\nhe was delicate: her name must not be public.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes, Dudley is without parallel as a gentleman,’ said Victor. ‘It\r\ndoes not suit me to hear the word “indulgent.” My dear, if you were down\r\nthere, you would discover that the talk was the talk of two or three\r\nmen seeing our girl ride by--and she did ride with a troop: why, we’ve\r\nwatched them along the parade, often. Clear as day how it happened! I’ll\r\ngo down early to-morrow.’\r\n\r\nHe fancied Nataly was appeased. And even out of this annoyance, there\r\nwas the gain of her being won to favour Dudley’s hitherto but tolerated\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\nNataly also had the fancy, that the calm following on her anguish, was\r\na moderation of it. She was kept strung to confide in her girl by the\r\nrecent indebtedness to her for words heavenly in the strengthening\r\ncomfort they gave. But no sooner was she alone than her torturing\r\nperplexities and her abasement of the hours previous to Victor’s coming\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nFor a girl of Nesta’s head could not be deceived; she had come home with\r\na woman’s intelligence of the world, hard knowledge of it--a knowledge\r\ndrawn from foul wells, the unhappy mother imagined: she dreaded to probe\r\nto the depth of it. She had in her wounded breast the world’s idea, that\r\ncorruption must come of the contact with impurity.\r\n\r\nNataly renewed her cry of despair: ‘The mother!--the daughter!’--her\r\nsole revelation of the heart’s hollows in her stammered speaking to\r\nVictor.\r\n\r\nShe thanked heaven for the loneliness of her bed, where she could\r\nrepeat: ‘The mother!--the daughter!’ hearing the world’s words:--the\r\ndaughter excused, by reason of her having such a mother; the mother\r\nunpitied for the bruiting of her brazen daughter’s name: but both alike\r\nconsigned to the corners of the world’s dust-heaps. She cried out, that\r\nher pride was broken. Her pride, her last support of life, had gone to\r\npieces. The tears she restrained in Victor’s presence, were called on to\r\ncome now, and she had none. It might be, that she had not strength for\r\nweeping. She was very weak. Rising from bed to lock her door against\r\nNesta’s entry to the room on her return at night, she could hardly\r\nstand: a chill and a clouding overcame her. The quitted bed seemed the\r\nhaven of a drifted wreck to reach.\r\n\r\nVictor tried the handle of a locked door in the dark of the early winter\r\nmorning. ‘The mother!--the daughter!’ had swung a pendulum for some time\r\nduring the night in him, too. He would rather have been subjected to the\r\nspectacle of tears than have heard that toneless voice, as it were the\r\ndry torrent-bed rolling blocks instead of melodious, if afflicting,\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nHe told Nesta not to disturb her mother, and murmured of a headache:\r\n‘Though, upon my word, the best cure for mama would be a look into\r\nFredi’s eyes!’ he said, embracing his girl, quite believing in her, just\r\na little afraid of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. NATALY, NESTA, AND DARTREY FENELLAN\r\n\r\nPleasant things, that come to us too late for our savour of the\r\nsweetness in them, toll ominously of life on the last walk to its end.\r\nYesterday, before Dudley Sowerby’s visit, Nataly would have been stirred\r\nwhere the tears we shed for happiness or repress at a flattery dwell\r\nwhen seeing her friend Mrs. John Cormyn enter her boudoir and hearing\r\nher speak repentantly, most tenderly. Mrs. John said: ‘You will believe\r\nI have suffered, dear; I am half my weight, I do think’: and she did not\r\nset the smile of responsive humour moving; although these two ladies had\r\na key of laughter between them. Nataly took her kiss; held her hand, and\r\nat the parting kissed her. She would rather have seen her friend than\r\nnot: so far she differed from a corpse; but she was near the likeness to\r\nthe dead in the insensibility to any change of light shining on one who\r\nbest loved darkness and silence. She cried to herself wilfully, that\r\nher pride was broken: as women do when they spurn at the wounding of\r\na dignity they cannot protect and die to see bleeding; for in it they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThe cry came of her pride unbroken, sore bruised, and after a certain\r\nspace for recovery combative. She said:\r\n\r\nAny expiation I could offer where I did injury, I would not refuse; I\r\nwould humble myself and bless heaven for being able to pay my debt--what\r\nI can of it. All I contend against is, injustice. And she sank into\r\nsensational protests of her anxious care of her daughter, too proud to\r\nphrase them.\r\n\r\nHer one great affliction, the scourging affliction of her utter\r\nloneliness;--an outcast from her family; daily, and she knew not\r\nhow, more shut away from the man she loved; now shut away from her\r\ngirl;--seemed under the hand of the angel of God. The abandonment of her\r\nby friends, was merely the light to show it.\r\n\r\nMidday’s post brought her a letter from Priscilla Graves, entreating\r\nto be allowed to call on her next day.--We are not so easily cast off!\r\nNataly said, bitterly, in relation to the lady whose offending had not\r\nbeen so great. She wrote: ‘Come, if sure that you sincerely wish to.’\r\n\r\nHaving fasted, she ate at lunch in her dressing-room, with some taste of\r\nthe food, haunted by an accusation of gluttony because of her eating at\r\nall, and a vile confession, that she was enabled to eat, owing to the\r\nreceipt of Priscilla’s empty letter: for her soul’s desire was to be\r\ndoing a deed of expiation, and the macerated flesh seemed her assurance\r\nto herself of the courage to make amends.--I must have some strength,\r\nshe said wearifully, in apology for the morsel consumed.\r\n\r\nNesta’s being in the house with her, became an excessive irritation.\r\nDoubts of the girl’s possible honesty to speak a reptile truth under\r\nquestion; amazement at her boldness to speak it; hatred of, the mouth\r\nthat could: and loathing of the words, the theme; and abomination of\r\nherself for conjuring fictitious images to rouse real emotions; all ran\r\ncounterthreads, that produced a mad pattern in the mind, affrighting\r\nto reason: and then, for its preservation, reason took a superrational\r\nleap, and ascribed the terrible injustice of this last cruel stroke to\r\nthe divine scourge, recognized divine by the selection of the mortal\r\nspot for chastisement. She clasped her breast, and said: It is mortal.\r\nAnd that calmed her.\r\n\r\nShe said, smiling: I never felt my sin until this blow came! Therefore\r\nthe blow was proved divine. Ought it not to be welcomed?--and she\r\nappearing no better than one of those, the leprous of the sex! And\r\nbrought to acknowledgement of the likeness by her daughter!\r\n\r\nNataly drank the poison distilled from her exclamations and was ice. She\r\nhad denied herself to Nesta’s redoubled petition. Nesta knocking at the\r\ndoor a third time and calling, tore the mother two ways: to have her\r\ngirl on her breast or snap their union in a word with an edge. She heard\r\nthe voice of Dartrey Fenellan.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted. ‘No, dear,’ she said to Nesta; and Nesta’s, ‘My own\r\nmother,’ consentingly said, in tender resignation, as she retired,\r\nsprang a stinging tear to the mother’s eyelids.\r\n\r\nDartrey looked at the door closing on the girl.\r\n\r\n‘Is it a very low woman?’ Nataly asked him in a Church whisper, with a\r\nface abashed.\r\n\r\n‘It is not,’ said he, quick to meet any abruptness.\r\n\r\n‘She must be cunning.’\r\n\r\n‘In the ordinary way. We say it of Puss before the hounds.’\r\n\r\n‘To deceive a girl like Nesta!’\r\n\r\n‘She has done no harm.’\r\n\r\n‘Dartrey, you speak to a mother. You have seen the woman? She is?--ah!’\r\n\r\n‘She is womanly, womanly.’\r\n\r\n‘Quite one of those...?’\r\n\r\n‘My dear soul! You can’t shake them off in that way. She is one of us.\r\nIf we have the class, we can’t escape from it. They are not to bear all\r\nthe burden because they exist. We are the bigger debtors. I tell you she\r\nis womanly.’\r\n\r\n‘It sounds like horrid cynicism.’\r\n\r\n‘Friends of mine would abuse it for the reverse.’\r\n\r\n‘Do not make me hate your chivalry. This woman is a rod on my back.\r\nProvided only she has not dropped venom into Nesta’s mind!’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t fear!’\r\n\r\n‘Can you tell me you think she has done no harm to my girl?’\r\n\r\n‘To Nesta herself?--not any: not to a girl like your girl.’\r\n\r\n‘To my girl’s name? Speak at once. But I know she has. She induced Nesta\r\nto go to her house. My girl was insulted in this woman’s house.’\r\n\r\nDartrey’s forehead ridged with his old fury and a gust of present\r\ncontempt. ‘I can tell you this, that the fellow who would think harm of\r\nit, knowing the facts ‘s not worthy of touching the tips of the fingers\r\nof your girl.’\r\n\r\n‘She is talked of!’\r\n\r\n‘A good-looking girl out riding with a handsome woman on a parade of\r\nidlers!’\r\n\r\n‘The woman is notorious.’ Nataly said it shivering.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. ‘Not true.’\r\n\r\n‘She has an air of a lady?’\r\n\r\n‘She sits a horse well.’\r\n\r\n‘Would she to any extent deceive me--impose on me here?’\r\n\r\n‘No.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!’ Nataly moaned....\r\n\r\n‘But what?’ said Dartrey. ‘There was no pretence. Her style is not worse\r\nthan that of some we have seen. There was no effort to deceive. The\r\nwoman’s plain for you and me to read, she has few of the arts; one or\r\ntwo tricks, if you like: and these were not needed for use. There are\r\nwomen who have them, and have not been driven or let slip into the\r\nwilderness.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes; I know!--those ideas of yours!’ Nataly had once admired him for\r\nhis knightliness toward the weakest women and the women underfoot. ‘You\r\nhave spoken to this woman? She boasted of acquaintance with Nesta?’\r\n\r\n‘She thanked God for having met her.’\r\n\r\n‘Is it one of the hysterical creatures?’\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett appeared fronting Dartrey.\r\n\r\nHe laughed to himself. ‘A clever question. There is a leaning to\r\nexcitement of manner at times. It ‘s not hysteria. Allow for her\r\nposition.’\r\n\r\nNataly took the unintended blow, and bowed to it; and still more harshly\r\nsaid: ‘What rank of life does the woman come from?’\r\n\r\n‘The class educated for a skittish career by your popular Stage and your\r\nBook-stalls. I am not precise?’\r\n\r\n‘Leave Mr. Durance. Is she in any degree commonly well bred?...\r\nbehaviour, talk-her English.’\r\n\r\n‘I trench on Mr. Durance in replying. Her English is passable. You may\r\nhear...’\r\n\r\n‘Everywhere, of course! And this woman of slipshod English and excited\r\nmanners imposed upon Nesta!’\r\n\r\n‘It would not be my opinion.’\r\n\r\n‘Did not impose on her!’\r\n\r\n‘Not many would impose on Nesta Radnor for long.’\r\n\r\n‘Think what that says, Dartrey!’\r\n\r\n‘You have had a detestable version of the story.’\r\n\r\n‘Because an excited creature thanks God to you for having met her!’\r\n\r\n‘She may. She’s a better woman for having met her. Don’t suppose we’re\r\nfor supernatural conversions. The woman makes no show of that. But she\r\nhas found a good soul among her sex--her better self in youth, as one\r\nguesses; and she is grateful--feels farther from exile in consequence.\r\nShe has found a lady to take her by the hand!--not a common case. She\r\ncan never go to the utterly bad after knowing Nesta. I forget if\r\nshe says it; I say it. You have heard the story from one of your\r\nconventional gentlemen.’\r\n\r\n‘A true gentleman. I have reason to thank him. He has not your ideas on\r\nthese matters, Dartrey. He is very sensitive... on Nesta’s behalf.’\r\n\r\n‘With reference to marriage. I’ll own I prefer another kind of\r\ngentleman. I ‘ve had my experience of that kind of gentleman. Many\r\nof the kind have added their spot to the outcasts abominated for\r\nuncleanness--in holy unction. Many?--I won’t say all; but men who\r\nconsent to hear black words pitched at them, and help to set good women\r\nfacing away from them, are pious dolts or rascal dogs of hypocrites.\r\nThey, if you’ll let me quote Colney Durance to you to-day--and how is it\r\nhe is not in favour?--they are tempting the Lord to turn the pillars of\r\nSociety into pillars of salt. Down comes the house. And priests can\r\nrest in sight of it!--They ought to be dead against the sanctimony\r\nthat believes it excommunicates when it curses. The relationship is\r\nnot dissolved so cheaply, though our Society affects to think it is.\r\nBarmby’s off to the East End of this London, Victor informs me:--good\r\nfellow! And there he’ll be groaning over our vicious nature. Nature is\r\nnot more responsible for vice than she is for inhumanity. Both bad, but\r\nthe latter’s the worse of the two.’\r\n\r\nNataly interposed: ‘I see the contrast, and see whom it’s to strike.’\r\n\r\nDartrey sent a thought after his meaning. ‘Hardly that. Let it stand.\r\nHe ‘s only one with the world: but he shares the criminal infamy for\r\ncrushing hope out of its frailest victims. They’re that--no sentiment.\r\nWhat a world, too, look behind it!--brutal because brutish. The world\r\nmay go hang: we expect more of your gentleman. To hear of Nesta down\r\nthere, and doubt that she was about good work; and come complaining! He\r\nhad the privilege of speaking to her, remonstrating, if he wished. There\r\nare men who think--men!--the plucking of sinners out of the mire a dirty\r\nbusiness. They depute it to certain officials. And your women--it’s the\r\ntaste of the world to have them educated so, that they can as little\r\ntake the humane as the enlightened view. Except, by the way, sometimes,\r\nin secret;--they have a sisterly breast. In secret, they do occasionally\r\nthink as they feel. In public, the brass mask of the Idol they call\r\nPropriety commands or supplies their feelings and thoughts. I won’t\r\nrepeat my reasons for educating them differently. At present we have but\r\nhalf the woman to go through life with--and thank you.’\r\n\r\nDartrey stopped. ‘Don’t be disturbed,’ he added. ‘There’s no ground for\r\nalarm. Not of any sort.’\r\n\r\nNataly said: ‘What name?’\r\n\r\n‘Her name is Mrs. Marsett.’\r\n\r\n‘The name is...?’\r\n\r\n‘Captain Marsett: will be Sir Edward. He came back from the Continent\r\nyesterday.’\r\n\r\nA fit of shuddering seized Nataly. It grew in violence, and speaking\r\nout of it, with a pause of sickly empty chatter of the jaws, she said:\r\n‘Always that name?’\r\n\r\n‘Before the maiden name? May have been or not.’\r\n\r\n‘Not, you say?’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t accurately know.’\r\n\r\nDartrey sprang to his legs. ‘My dear soul! dear friend--one of the best!\r\nif we go on fencing in the dark, there’ll be wounds. Your way of taking\r\nthis affair disappointed me. Now I understand. It’s the disease of a\r\ntrouble, to fly at comparisons. No real one exists. I wished to protect\r\nthe woman from a happier sister’s judgement, to save you from alarm\r\nconcerning Nesta:--quite groundless, if you’ll believe me. Come, there’s\r\nplenty of benevolent writing abroad on these topics now: facts are\r\nmore looked at, and a good woman may join us in taking them without\r\nthe horrors and loathings of angels rather too much given to claim\r\ndistinction from the luckless. A girl who’s unprotected may go through\r\nadventures before she fixes, and be a creature of honest intentions.\r\nBetter if protected, we all agree. Better also if the world did not\r\nfavour the girl’s multitude of enemies. Your system of not dealing with\r\nfacts openly is everyway favourable to them. I am glad to say, Victor\r\nrecognizes what corruption that spread of wealth is accountable for.\r\nAnd now I must go and have a talk with the--what a change from the blue\r\nbutterfly! Eaglet, I ought to have said. I dine with you, for Victor may\r\nbring news.’\r\n\r\n‘Would anything down there be news to you, Dartrey?’\r\n\r\n‘He makes it wherever he steps.’\r\n\r\n‘He would reproach me for not detaining you. Tell Nesta I have to lie\r\ndown after talking. She has a child’s confidence in you.’\r\n\r\nA man of middle age! he said to himself. It is the particular\r\nejaculation which tames the senior whose heart is for a dash of holiday.\r\nHe resolved, that the mother might trust to the discretion of a man of\r\nhis age; and he went down to Nesta, grave with the weight his count of\r\nyears should give him. Seeing her, the light of what he now knew of her\r\nwas an ennobling equal to celestial. For this fair girl was one of the\r\nactive souls of the world--his dream to discover in woman’s form. She,\r\nthe little Nesta, the tall pure-eyed girl before him, was, young though\r\nshe was, already in the fight with evil: a volunteer of the army of the\r\nsimply Christian. The worse for it? Sowerby would think so. She was not\r\nof the order of young women who, in sheer ignorance or in voluntary,\r\nconsent to the peace with evil, and are kept externally safe from the\r\nsmirch of evil, and are the ornaments of their country, glory of a\r\ncountry prizing ornaments higher than qualities.\r\n\r\nDartrey could have been momentarily incredulous of things revealed by\r\nMrs. Marsett--not incredulous of the girl’s heroism: that capacity\r\nhe caught and gauged in her shape of head, cut of mouth, and the\r\nmeasurements he was accustomed to make at a glance:--but her beauty, or\r\nthe form of beauty which was hers, argued against her having set foot of\r\nthought in our fens. Here and far there we meet a young saint vowed to\r\nservice along by those dismal swamps: and saintly she looks; not of this\r\nearth. Nesta was of the blooming earth. Where do we meet girl or woman\r\ncomparable to garden-flowers, who can dare to touch to lift the spotted\r\nof her sex? He was puzzled by Nesta’s unlikeness in deeds and in aspect.\r\nHe remembered her eyes, on the day when he and Colonel Sudley beheld\r\nher; presently he was at quiet grapple with her mind. His doubts cleared\r\noff. Then the question came, How could a girl of heroical character be\r\nattached to the man Sowerby? That entirely passed belief.\r\n\r\nAnd was it possible his wishes beguiled his hearing? Her tones were\r\nsingularly vibrating.\r\n\r\nThey talked for a while before, drawing a deep breath, she said: ‘I\r\nfancy I am in disgrace with my mother.’\r\n\r\n‘You have a suspicion why?’ said he.\r\n\r\n‘I have.’\r\n\r\nShe would have told him why: the words were at her lips. Previous to her\r\nemotion on the journey home, the words would have come out. They were\r\narrested by the thunder of the knowledge, that the nobleness in him\r\ndrawing her to be able to speak of scarlet matter, was personally\r\nworshipped.\r\n\r\nHe attributed the full rose upon her cheeks to the forbidding subject.\r\n\r\nTo spare pain, he said: ‘No misunderstanding with the dear mother will\r\nlast the day through. Can I help?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Captain Dartrey!’\r\n\r\n‘Drop the captain. Dartrey will do.’\r\n\r\n‘How could I!’\r\n\r\n‘You’re not wanting in courage, Nesta.’\r\n\r\n‘Hardly for that!’\r\n\r\n‘By-and-by, then.’\r\n\r\n‘Though I could not say Mr. Fenellan.’\r\n\r\n‘You see; Dartrey, it must be.’\r\n\r\n‘If I could!’\r\n\r\n‘But the fellow is not a captain: and he is a friend, an old friend,\r\nvery old friend: he’ll be tipped with grey in a year or two.’\r\n\r\n‘I might be bolder then.’\r\n\r\n‘Imagine it now. There is no disloyalty in your calling your friends by\r\ntheir names.’\r\n\r\nHer nature rang to the implication. ‘I am not bound.’ Dartrey hung fast,\r\nspeculating on her visibly: ‘I heard you were?’\r\n\r\n‘No. I must be free.’\r\n\r\n‘It is not an engagement?’\r\n\r\n‘Will you laugh?--I have never quite known. My father desired it: and\r\nmy desire is to please him. I think I am vain enough to think I read\r\nthrough blinds and shutters. The engagement--what there was--has been,\r\nto my reading, broken more than once. I have not considered it, to\r\nsettle my thoughts on it, until lately: and now I may suspect it to be\r\nbroken. I have given cause--if it is known. There is no blame elsewhere.\r\nI am not unhappy, Captain Dartrey.’\r\n\r\n‘Captain by courtesy. Very well. Tell me how Nesta judges the engagement\r\nto be broken?’\r\n\r\nShe was mentally phrasing before she said: ‘Absence.’\r\n\r\n‘He was here yesterday.’\r\n\r\nAll that the visit embraced was in her expressive look, as of sight\r\ndrawing inward, like our breath in a spell of wonderment. ‘Then I\r\nunderstand; it enlightens me.\r\n\r\nMy own mother!--my poor mother! he should have come to me. I was the\r\nguilty person, not she; and she is the sufferer. That, if in life were\r\ndirect retribution! but the very meaning of having a heart, is to suffer\r\nthrough others or for them.’\r\n\r\n‘You have soon seen that, dear girl,’ said Dartrey.\r\n\r\n‘So, my own mother, and loving me as she does, blames me!’ Nesta sighed;\r\nshe took a sharp breath. ‘You? do you blame me too?’\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand, enamoured of her instantaneous divination and\r\nheavenly candour.\r\n\r\nBut he was admonished, that to speak high approval would not be\r\nhonourable advantage taken of the rival condemning; and he said: ‘Blame?\r\nSome think it is not always the right thing to do the right thing. I’ve\r\nmade mistakes, with no bad design. A good mother’s view is not often\r\nwrong.’\r\n\r\n‘You pressed my hand,’ she murmured.\r\n\r\nThat certainly had said more.\r\n\r\n‘Glad to again,’ he responded. It was uttered airily and was meant to be\r\nas lightly done.\r\n\r\nNesta did not draw back her hand. ‘I feel strong when you press it.’\r\nHer voice wavered, and as when we hear a flask sing thin at the filling,\r\nceased upon evidence of a heart surcharged. How was he to relax the\r\npressure!--he had to give her the strength she craved: and he vowed it\r\nshould be but for half a minute, half a minute longer.\r\n\r\nHer tears fell; she eyed him steadily; she had the look of sunlight in\r\nshower.\r\n\r\n‘Oldish men are the best friends for you, I suppose,’ he said; and her\r\ngaze turned elusive phrases to vapour.\r\n\r\nHe was compelled to see the fiery core of the raincloud lighting it\r\nfor a revealment, that allowed as little as it retained of a shadow of\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nThe sight was keener than touch and the run of blood with blood to\r\nquicken slumbering seeds of passion.\r\n\r\nBut here is the place of broken ground and tangle, which calls to\r\nhonourable men, not bent on sport, to be wary to guard the gunlock. He\r\nstopped the word at his mouth. It was not in him to stop or moderate the\r\nforce of his eyes. She met them with the slender unbendingness that was\r\nher own; a feminine of inspirited manhood. There was no soft expression,\r\nonly the direct shot of light, on both sides; conveying as much as is\r\nborne from sun to earth, from earth to sun. And when such an exchange\r\nhas come between the two, they are past plighting, they are the wedded\r\none.\r\n\r\nNesta felt it, without asking whether she was loved. She was his. She\r\nhad not a thought of the word of love or the being beloved. Showers\r\nof painful blissfulness went through her, as the tremours of a shocked\r\nframe, while she sat quietly, showing scarce a sign; and after he had\r\nlet her hand go, she had the pressure on it. The quivering intense of\r\nthe moment of his eyes and grasp was lord of her, lord of the day and\r\nof all days coming. That is how Love slays Death. Never did girl so give\r\nher soul.\r\n\r\nShe would have been the last to yield it unreservedly to a man untrusted\r\nfor the character she worshipped. But she could have given it to\r\nDartrey, despite his love of another, because it was her soul, without\r\nany of the cravings, except to bestow.\r\n\r\nHe perceived, that he had been carried on for the number of steps which\r\nare countless miles and do not permit the retreat across the desert\r\nbehind; and he was in some amazement at himself, remindful of the\r\ndifferent nature of our restraining power when we have a couple playing\r\non it. Yet here was this girl, who called him up to the heights of\r\nyoung life again: and a brave girl; and she bled for the weak, had no\r\nshrinking from the women underfoot: for the reason, that she was a girl\r\nsovereignly pure, angelically tender. Was there a point of honour to\r\nhold him back?\r\n\r\nNataly entered the room. She kissed Nesta, and sat silent.\r\n\r\n‘Mother, will you speak of me to him, if I go out?’ Nesta said.\r\n\r\n‘We have spoken,’ her mother replied, vexed by the unmaidenly allusion\r\nto that theme.\r\n\r\nShe would have asked, How did you guess I knew of it?--but that the Why\r\nshould I speak of you to him? struck the louder note in her bosom: and\r\nthen, What is there that this girl cannot guess!--filled the mother’s\r\nheart with apprehensive dread: and an inward cry, What things will she\r\nnot set going, to have them discussed. And the appalling theme, sitting\r\noffensive though draped in their midst, was taken for a proof of the\r\ngirl’s unblushingness. After standing as one woman against the world so\r\nlong, Nataly was relieved to be on the side of a world now convictedly\r\nunjust to her in the confounding of her with the shameless. Her mind had\r\ntaken the brand of that thought:--And Nesta had brought her to it:--And\r\nDudley Sowerby, a generous representative of the world, had kindly,\r\nhaving the deputed power to do so, sustained her, only partially blaming\r\nNesta, not casting them off; as the world, with which Nataly felt, under\r\na sense of the protection calling up all her gratitude to young Dudley,\r\nwould have approved his doing.\r\n\r\nShe was passing through a fit of the cowardice peculiar to the tediously\r\nstrained, who are being more than commonly tried--persecuted, as they\r\nsay when they are not supplicating their tyrannical Authority for\r\naid. The world will continue to be indifferent to their view of it\r\nand behaviour toward it until it ceases to encourage the growth of\r\nhypocrites.\r\n\r\nThese are moments when the faces we are observing drop their charm,\r\nshowing us our perversion internal, if we could but reflect, to see it.\r\nVery many thousand times above Dudley Sowerby, Nataly ranked Dartrey\r\nFenellan; and still she looked at him, where he sat beside Nesta,\r\nungenially, critical of the very features, jealously in the interests of\r\nDudley; and recollecting, too, that she had once prayed for one exactly\r\nresembling Dartrey Fenellan to be her Nesta’s husband. But, as she would\r\nhave said, that was before the indiscretion of her girl had shown her\r\nto require for her husband a man whose character and station guaranteed\r\nprotection instead of inciting to rebellion. And Dartrey, the loved and\r\nprized, was often in the rebel ranks; he was dissatisfied with matters\r\nas they are; was restless for action, angry with a country denying it to\r\nhim; he made enemies, he would surely bring down inquiries about Nesta’s\r\nhead, and cause the forgotten or quiescent to be stirred; he would\r\nscarcely be the needed hand for such a quiver of the lightnings as Nesta\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nDartrey read Nataly’s brows. This unwonted uncomeliness of hers was an\r\nindication to one or other of our dusky pits, not a revealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX. A CHAPTER IN THE SHADOW OF MRS. MARSETT\r\n\r\nHe read her more closely when Arlington brought in the brown paper\r\nenvelope of the wires--to which the mate of Victor ought to have become\r\naccustomed. She took it; her eyelids closed, and her features were\r\ndriven to whiteness. ‘Only these telegrams,’ she said, in apology.\r\n\r\n‘Lakelands on fire?’ Dartrey murmured to Nesta; and she answered: ‘I\r\nshould not be sorry.’\r\n\r\nNataly coldly asked her why she would not be sorry.\r\n\r\nDartrey interposed: ‘I’m sure she thinks Lakelands worries her mother.’\r\n\r\n‘That ranks low among the worries,’ Nataly sighed, opening the envelope.\r\n\r\nNesta touched her arm: ‘Mother! even before Captain Dartrey, if you will\r\nlet me!’--she turned to him: ‘before...’ at the end of her breath she\r\nsaid: ‘Dartrey Fenellan. You shall see my whole heart, mother.’\r\n\r\nHer mother looked from her at him.\r\n\r\n‘Victor returns by the last train. He telegraphs, that he dines with--’\r\nShe handed the paper to Dartrey.\r\n\r\n‘Marsett,’ he read aloud; and she flushed; she was angry with him for\r\nnot knowing, that the name was a term of opprobrium flung at her.\r\n\r\n‘It’s to tell you he has done what he thought good,’ said Dartrey. ‘In\r\nother words, as I interpret, he has completed his daughter’s work. So we\r\nwon’t talk about it till he comes. You have no company this evening?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! there is a pause to-night! It’s nearly as unceasing as your brother\r\nSimeon’s old French lady in the ronde with her young bridegroom, till\r\nthey danced her to pieces. I do get now and then an hour’s repose,’\r\nNataly added, with a vision springing up of the person to whom the story\r\nhad applied.\r\n\r\n‘My dear, you are a good girl to call me Dartrey,’ the owner of the name\r\nsaid to Nesta.\r\n\r\nNataly saw them both alert, in the terrible manner peculiar to both, for\r\nthe directest of the bare statements. She could have protested, that her\r\nlove of truth was on an equality with theirs; and certainly, that her\r\nregard for decency was livelier. Pass the deficiency in a man. But a\r\ngirl who could speak, by allusion, of Mrs. Marsett--of the existence of\r\na Mrs. Marsett--in the presence of a man: and he excusing, encouraging:\r\nand this girl her own girl;--it seemed to her, that the world reeled;\r\nshe could hardly acknowledge the girl; save under the penitential\r\nadmission of her sin’s having found her out.\r\n\r\nShe sent Nesta to her room when they went upstairs to dress, unable\r\nto endure her presence after seeing her show a placid satisfaction at\r\nDartrey’s nod to the request for him to sleep in the house that night.\r\nIt was not at all a gleam of pleasure, hardly an expression; it was a\r\nmanner of saying, One drop more in my cup of good fortune! an absurd and\r\nan offensive exhibition of silly optimism of the young, blind that they\r\nare!\r\n\r\nFor were it known, and surely the happening of it would be known,\r\nthat Dudley Sowerby had shaken off the Nesta of no name, who was the\r\nabominable Mrs. Marsett’s friend, a whirlwind with a trumpet would sweep\r\nthem into the wilderness on a blast frightfuller than any ever heard.\r\n\r\nNataly had a fit of weeping for want of the girl’s embrace, against\r\nwhom her door was jealously locked. She hoped those two would talk much,\r\nmadly if they liked, during dinner, that she might not be sensible,\r\nthrough any short silence, of the ardour animating them: especially\r\nglowing in Nesta, ready behind her quiet mask to come brazenly forth.\r\nBut both of them were mercilessly ardent; and a sickness of the fear,\r\nthat they might fall on her to capture her and hurry her along with them\r\nperforce of the allayed, once fatal, inflammable element in herself,\r\nshook the warmth from her limbs: causing her to say to herself aloud\r\nin a ragged hoarseness, very strangely: Every thought of mine now has a\r\nphysical effect on me!\r\n\r\nThey had not been two minutes together when she descended to them. Yet\r\nshe saw the girl’s heart brimming, either with some word spoken to\r\nher or for joy of an unmaidenly confession. During dinner they talked,\r\nwithout distressful pauses. Whatever said, whatever done, was manifestly\r\nanother drop in Nesta’s foolish happy cup. Could it be all because\r\nDartrey Fenellan countenanced her acquaintance with that woman? The\r\nmother had lost hold of her. The tortured mother had lost hold of\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nDartrey in the course of the evening, begged to hear the contralto; and\r\nNataly, refusing, was astounded by the admission in her blank mind of\r\nthe truth of man’s list of charges against her sex, starting from their\r\ncapriciousness for she could have sung in a crowded room, and she had\r\nnow a desire for company, for stolid company or giddy, an ocean of it.\r\nThis led to her thinking, that the world of serious money-getters,\r\nand feasts, and the dance, the luxurious displays, and the reverential\r\nSunday service, will always ultimately prove itself right in opposition\r\nto critics and rebels, and to any one vainly trying to stand alone: and\r\nthe thought annihilated her; for she was past the age of the beginning\r\nagain, and no footing was left for an outsider not self-justified in\r\nbeing where she stood. She heard Dartrey’s praise of Nesta’s voice for\r\ntearing her mother’s bosom with notes of intolerable sweetness; and it\r\nwas haphazard irony, no doubt; we do not the less bleed for the accident\r\nof a shot.\r\n\r\nAt last, after midnight Victor arrived.\r\n\r\nNesta most impudently expected to be allowed to remain. ‘Pray, go,\r\ndear,’ her mother said. Victor kissed his Fredi. ‘Some time to-morrow,’\r\nsaid he; and she forbore to beseech him.\r\n\r\nHe stared, though mildly, at sight of her taking Dartrey’s hand for the\r\ngood-night and deliberately putting her lips to it.\r\n\r\nWas she a girl whose notion of rectifying one wrong thing done, was to\r\ndo another? Nataly could merely observe. A voice pertaining to no\r\none present, said in her ear:--Mothers have publicly slapped their\r\ndaughter’s faces for less than that!--It was the voice of her incapacity\r\nto cope with the girl. She watched Nesta’s passage from the room,\r\nsomewhat affected by the simple bearing for which she was reproaching\r\nher.\r\n\r\n‘And our poor darling has not seen a mountain this year!’ Victor\r\nexclaimed, to have mentionable grounds for pitying his girl. ‘I promised\r\nFredi she should never count a year without Highlands or Alps. You\r\nremember, mama?--down in the West Highlands. Fancy the dear bit of\r\nbundle, Dartrey!--we had laid her in her bed; she was about seven or\r\neight; and there she lay wide awake. “What ‘s Fredi thinking of?”--“I’m\r\nthinking of the tops of the mountains at night, dada.”--She could climb\r\nthem now; she has the legs.’\r\n\r\nNataly said: ‘You have some report to make. You dined with those\r\npeople?’\r\n\r\n‘The Marsetts: yes:--well-suited couple enough. It’s to happen before\r\nWinter ends--at once; before Christmas; positively before next Spring.\r\nFredi’s doing! He has to manage, arrange.--She’s a good-looking woman,\r\ngood height, well-rounded; well-behaved, too: she won’t make a bad Lady\r\nMarsett. Every time that woman spoke of our girl, the tears jumped to\r\nher eyelids.’\r\n\r\n‘Come to me before you go to bed,’ Nataly said, rising, her voice\r\nfoundering; ‘Good-night, Dartrey.’\r\n\r\nShe turned to the door; she could not trust herself to shake hands with\r\ncomposure. Not only was it a nauseous mixture she was forced to gulp\r\nfrom Victor, it burned like a poison.\r\n\r\n‘Really Fredi’s doing--chiefly,’ said Victor, as soon as Dartrey and he\r\nwere alone, comfortably settled in the smoking-room. ‘I played the\r\nman of pomp with Marsett--good heavy kind of creature: attached to the\r\nwoman. She’s the better horse, as far as brains go. Good enough Lady\r\nMarsett. I harped on Major Worrell: my daughter insulted. He knew of\r\nit--spoke of you properly. The man offered all apologies; he has told\r\nthe Major he is no gentleman, not a fit associate for gentlemen:--quite\r\nso--and has cut him dead. Will marry her, as I said, make her as worthy\r\nas he can of the honour of my daughter’s acquaintance. Rather comical\r\ngrimace, when he vowed he’d fasten the tie. He doesn’t like marriage.\r\nBut, he can’t give her up. And she’s for patronizing the institution.\r\nBut she is ready to say good-bye to him “rather than see the truest\r\nlady in the world insulted”--her words. And so he swallows his dose\r\nfor health, and looks a trifle sourish. Antecedents, I suppose: has to\r\nstomach them. But if a man’s fond of a woman--if he knows he saves her\r\nfrom slipping lower--and it’s an awful world, for us to let a woman be\r\nunder its wheels:--I say, a woman who has a man to lean on, unless she’s\r\nas downright corrupt as two or three of the men we’ve known:--upon my\r\nword, Dartrey, I come round to some of your ideas on these matters. It’s\r\nthis girl of mine, this wee bit of girl in her little nightshirt with\r\nthe frill, astonishes me most:--“thinking of the tops of the mountains\r\nat night!” She has positively done the whole of this work-main part. I\r\nsmiled when I left the house, to have to own our little Fredi starting\r\nus all on the road. It seems, Marsett had sworn he would; amorous vow,\r\nyou know; he never came nearer to doing it. I hope it’s his better\r\nmind now; I do hope the man won’t have cause to regret it. He speaks of\r\nNesta--sort of rustic tone of awe. Mrs. Marsett has impressed him. He\r\nexpects the title soon, will leave the army--the poor plucked British\r\narmy, as you call it!--and lead the life of a country squire: hunting!\r\nWell, it’s not only the army, it’s over Great Britain, with this\r\ninfernal wealth of ours!--and all for pleasure--eh?--or Paradise lost\r\nfor a sugar plum! Eh, Dartrey? Upon my word, it appears to me, Esau’s\r\nthe Englishman, Jacob the German, of these times. I wonder old Colney\r\nhasn’t said it. If we’re not plucked, as your regiments are of the\r\nofficers who have learnt their work, we’re emasculated:--the nation’s\r\nhalf made-up of the idle and the servants of the idle.’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, and your country squires and your manufacturers contrive to give\r\nthe army a body of consumptive louts fit for nothing else than to take\r\nthe shilling--and not worth it,’ said Dartrey.\r\n\r\n‘Sounds like old Colney,’ Victor remarked to himself. ‘But, believe me,\r\nI’m ashamed of the number of servants who wait on me. It wouldn’t\r\nso much matter, as Skepsey says, if they were trained to arms and\r\nself-respect. That little fellow Skepsey’s closer to the right notion,\r\nand the right practice, too, than any of us. With his Matilda Pridden!\r\nHe has jumped out of himself to the proper idea of women, too. And\r\nthere’s a man who has been up three times before the magistrates, and is\r\nconsidered a disorderly subject--one among the best of English citizens,\r\nI declare! I never think of Skepsey without the most extraordinary,\r\nwitless kind of envy--as if he were putting in action an idea I once\r\nhad and never quite got hold of again. The match for him is Fredi. She\r\nthreatens to be just as devoted, just as simple, as he. I positively\r\ndoubt whether any of us could stop her, if she had set herself to do a\r\nthing she thought right.’\r\n\r\n‘I should not like to think our trying it possible,’ said Dartrey.\r\n\r\n‘All very well, but it’s a rock ahead. We shall have to alter our\r\ncourse, my friend. You know, I dined with that couple, after the private\r\ntwenty minutes with Marsett: he formally propounded the invitation, as\r\nwe were close on his hour, rather late: and I wanted to make the\r\nwoman happy, besides putting a seal of cordiality on his good\r\nintentions--politic! And subsequently I heard from her, that--you’ll\r\nthink nothing of it!--Fredi promised to stand by her at the altar.’\r\n\r\nDartrey said, shrugging: ‘She needn’t do that.’\r\n\r\n‘So we may say. You’re dealing with Nesta Victoria. Spare me a contest\r\nwith that girl, I undertake to manage any man or woman living.’\r\n\r\n‘When the thing to be done is thought right by her.’\r\n\r\n‘But can we always trust her judgement, my dear Dartrey?’\r\n\r\n‘In this case, she would argue, that her resolution to keep her promise\r\nwould bind or help to bind Marsett to fulfil his engagement.’\r\n\r\n‘Odd, her mother has turned dead round in favour of that fellow Dudley\r\nSowerby! I don’t complain; it suits; but one thinks--eh?--women!’\r\n\r\n‘Well, yes, one thinks or should think, that if you insist on having\r\nwomen rooted to the bed of the river, they’ll veer with the tides, like\r\nwater-weeds, and no wonder.’\r\n\r\n‘Your heterodoxy on that subject is a mania, Dartrey. We can’t have\r\nwomen independent.’\r\n\r\n‘Then don’t be exclaiming about their vagaries.’\r\n\r\nVictor mused: ‘It’s wonderful: that little girl of mine!--good height\r\nnow: but what a head she has! Oh, she’ll listen to reason: only mark\r\nwhat I say:--with that quiet air of hers, the husband, if a young\r\nfellow, will imagine she’s the most docile of wives in the world. And\r\nas to wife, I’m not of the contrary opinion. But qua individual female,\r\nsupposing her to have laid fast hold of an idea of duty, it’s he who’ll\r\nhave to turn the corner second, if they’re to trot in the yoke together.\r\nOr it may be an idea of service to a friend--or to her sex! That Mrs.\r\nMarsett says she feels for--“bleeds” for her sex. The poor woman didn’t\r\nshow to advantage with me, because she was in a fever to please:--talks\r\nin jerks, hot phrases. She holds herself well. At the end of the dinner\r\nshe behaved better. Odd, you can teach women with hints and a lead. But\r\nMarsett ‘s Marsett to the end. Rather touching!--the poor fellow\r\nsaid: Deuce of a bad look-out for me if Judith doesn’t have a child!\r\nFirst-rate sportsman, I hear. He should have thought of his family\r\nearlier. You know, Dartrey, the case is to be argued for the family as\r\nwell. You won’t listen. And for Society too! Off you go.’\r\n\r\nA battery was opened on that wall of composite.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, well,’ said Victor. ‘But I may have to beg your help, as to the\r\nso-called promise to stand at the altar. I don’t mention it upstairs.’\r\n\r\nHe went to Nataly’s room.\r\n\r\nShe was considerately treated, and was aware of being dandled, that she\r\nmight have sleep.\r\n\r\nShe consented to it, in a loathing of the topic.--Those women invade\r\nus--we cannot keep them out! was her inward cry: with a reverberation of\r\nthe unfailing accompaniment: The world holds you for one of them!\r\n\r\nVictor tasked her too much when his perpetual readiness to doat upon\r\nhis girl for whatever she did, set him exalting Nesta’s conduct. She\r\nthought: Was Nesta so sympathetic with her mother of late by reason of a\r\nmoral insensibility to the offence?\r\n\r\nThis was her torture through the night of a labouring heart, that\r\ntravelled to one dull shock, again and again repeated:--the apprehended\r\nsound, in fact, of Dudley Sowerby’s knock at the street door. Or\r\nsometimes a footman handed her his letter, courteously phrased to\r\nwithdraw from the alliance. Or else he came to a scene with Nesta, and\r\nher mother was dragged into it, and the intolerable subject steamed\r\nabout her. The girl was visioned as deadly. She might be indifferent to\r\nthe protection of Dudley’s name. Robust, sanguine, Victor’s child, she\r\nmight--her mother listened to a devil’s whisper--but no; Nesta’s aim was\r\nat the heights; she was pure in mind as in body. No, but the world would\r\nbring the accusation; and the world would trace the cause: Heredity,\r\nit would say. Would it say falsely? Nataly harped on the interrogation\r\nuntil she felt her existence dissolving to a dark stain of the earth,\r\nand she found herself wondering at the breath she drew, doubting that\r\nanother would follow, speculating on the cruel force which keeps us to\r\nthe act of breathing.--Though I could draw wild blissful breath if I\r\nwere galloping across the moors! her worn heart said to her youth: and\r\nout of ken of the world, I could regain a portion of my self-esteem.\r\nNature thereat renewed her old sustainment with gentle murmurs, that\r\nwere supported by Dr. Themison’s account of the virtuous married lady\r\nwho chafed at the yoke on behalf of her sex, and deemed the independent\r\nunion the ideal. Nataly’s brain had a short gallop over moorland. It\r\nbrought her face to face with Victor’s girl, and she dropped once more\r\nto her remorse in herself and her reproaches of Nesta. The girl had\r\ninherited from her father something of the cataract’s force which won\r\nits way by catching or by mastering, uprooting, ruining!\r\n\r\nIn the morning she was heavily asleep. Victor left word with Nesta,\r\nthat the dear mother was not to be disturbed. Consequently, when Dudley\r\ncalled to see Mrs. Victor Radnor, he was informed that Miss Radnor would\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\nTheir interview lasted an hour.\r\n\r\nDudley came to Victor in the City about luncheon time.\r\n\r\nHis perplexity of countenance was eloquent. He had, before seeing the\r\nyoung lady, digested an immense deal more, as it seemed to him, than any\r\nEnglish gentleman should be asked to consume. She now referred him\r\nto her father, who had spent a day in Brighton, and would, she said,\r\nexplain whatever there was to be explained. But she added, that if she\r\nwas expected to abandon a friend, she could not. Dudley had argued with\r\nher upon the nature of friendship, the measurement of its various dues;\r\nhe had lectured on the choice of friends, the impossibility for young\r\nladies, necessarily inexperienced, to distinguish the right class of\r\nfriends, the dangers they ran in selecting friends unwarranted by the\r\nstamp of honourable families.\r\n\r\n‘And what did Fredi say to that?’ Victor inquired.\r\n\r\n‘Miss Radnor said--I may be dense, I cannot comprehend--that the\r\nprecepts were suitable for seminaries of Pharisees. When it is a\r\nquestion of a young lady associating with a notorious woman!’\r\n\r\n‘Not notorious. You spoil your case if you “speak extremely,” as a\r\nfriend says. I saw her yesterday. She worships “Miss Radnor.”’\r\n\r\nNesta will know when she is older; she will thank me,’ said Dudley\r\nhurriedly. ‘As it is at present, I may reckon, I hope, that the\r\nassociation ceases. Her name: I have to consider my family.’\r\n\r\n‘Good anchorage! You must fight it out with the girl. And depend\r\nupon this--you’re not the poorer for being the husband of a girl of\r\ncharacter; unless you try to bridle her. She belongs to her time. I\r\ndon’t mind owning to you, she has given me a lead.--Fredi ‘ll be merry\r\nto-night. Here’s a letter I have from the Sanfredini, dated Milan, fresh\r\nthis morning; invitation to bring the god-child to her villa on Como in\r\nMay; desirous to embrace her. She wrote to the office. Not a word of her\r\nduque. She has pitched him to the winds. You may like to carry it off to\r\nFredi and please her.’\r\n\r\n‘I have business,’ Dudley replied.\r\n\r\n‘Away to it, then!’ said Victor. ‘You stand by me?--we expect our South\r\nLondon borough to be open in January; early next year, at least; may be\r\nFebruary. You have family interest there.’\r\n\r\n‘Personally, I will do my best,’ Dudley said; and he escaped, feeling,\r\nwith the universal censor’s angry spite, that the revolutions of the\r\nworld had made one of the wealthiest of City men the head of a set of\r\nBohemians. And there are eulogists of the modern time! And the man’s\r\ndaughter was declared to belong to it! A visit in May to the Italian\r\ncantatrice separated from her husband, would render the maiden an\r\naccomplished flinger of caps over the windmills.\r\n\r\nAt home Victor discovered, that there was not much more than a truce\r\nbetween Nesta and Nataly. He had a medical hint from Dr. Themison,\r\nand he counselled his girl to humour her mother as far as could be:\r\nparticularly in relation to Dudley, whom Nataly now, womanlike, after\r\nopposing, strongly favoured. How are we ever to get a clue to the\r\nlabyrinthine convolutions and changeful motives of the sex! Dartrey’s\r\ntheories were absurd. Did Nataly think them dangerous for a young woman?\r\nThe guess hinted at a clue of some sort to the secret of her veering.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Sowerby left me with an adieu,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Sowerby! My dear, he is bound, bound in honour, bound at heart. You\r\ndid not dismiss him?’\r\n\r\n‘I repeated the word he used. I thought of mother. The blood leaves her\r\ncheeks at a disappointment now. She has taken to like him.’\r\n\r\n‘Why, you like him!’\r\n\r\n‘I could not vow.’\r\n\r\n‘Tush.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, don’t press me, dada. But you will see, he has disengaged himself.’\r\n\r\nHe had done it, though not in formal speech. Slow digestion of his\r\nnative antagonism to these Bohemians, to say nothing of his judicial\r\ncondemnation of them, brought him painfully round to the writing of a\r\nletter to Nataly; cunningly addressed to the person on whom his instinct\r\ntold him he had the strongest hold.\r\n\r\nShe schooled herself to discuss the detested matter forming Dudley’s\r\ngrievance and her own with Nesta; and it was a woeful half-hour for\r\nthem. But Nataly was not the weeper.\r\n\r\nAnother interview ensued between Nesta and her suitor. Dudley bore no\r\nresemblance to Mr. Barmby, who refused to take the word no from her, and\r\nhad taken it, and had gone to do holy work, for which she revered him.\r\nDudley took the word, leaving her to imagine freedom, until once more\r\nher mother or her father, inspired by him, came interceding, her mother\r\nactually supplicating. So that the reality of Dudley’s love rose to\r\nconception like a London dawn over Nesta; and how, honourably, decently,\r\npositively, to sever herself from it, grew to be an ill-visaged problem.\r\nShe glanced in soul at Dartrey Fenellan for help; she had her wild\r\nthoughts. Having once called him Dartrey, the virginal barrier to\r\nthoughts was broken; and but for love of her father, for love and pity\r\nof her mother, she would have ventured the step to make the man who had\r\nher whole being in charge accept or reject her. Nothing else appeared in\r\nprospect. Her father and mother were urgently one to favour Dudley; and\r\nthe sensitive gentleman presented himself to receive his wound and to\r\ndepart with it. But always he returned. At last, as if under tuition,\r\nhe refrained from provoking a wound; he stood there to win her upon any\r\nterms; and he was a handsome figure, acknowledged by the damsel to\r\nbe increasing in good looks as more and more his pretensions became\r\ndistasteful to her. The slight cast of sourness on his lower features\r\nhad almost vanished, his nature seemed to have enlarged. He complimented\r\nher for her ‘generous benevolence,’ vaguely, yet with evident\r\nsincereness; he admitted, that the modern world is ‘attempting\r\ndifficulties with at least commendable intentions’; and that the\r\nposition of women demands improvement, consideration for them also.\r\nHe said feelingly: ‘They have to bear extraordinary burdens!’ There he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nThe sharp intelligence fronting him understood, that this compassionate\r\nejaculation was the point where she, too, must cry halt. He had,\r\nhowever--still under tuition, perhaps--withdrawn his voice from the\r\npursuit of her; and so she in gratitude silenced her critical mind\r\nbeneath a smooth conceit of her having led him two steps to a broader\r\ntolerance. Susceptible as she was, she did not influence him without\r\nbeing affected herself in other things than her vanity: his prudishness\r\naffected her. Only when her heart flamed did she disdain that real haven\r\nof refuge, with its visionary mount of superiority, offered by Society\r\nto its effect, in the habit of ignoring the sins it fosters under\r\ncloak;--not less than did the naked barbaric time, and far more to the\r\nvitiation of the soul. He fancied he was moulding her; therefore winning\r\nher. It followed, that he had the lover’s desire for assurance of\r\nexclusive possession; and reflecting, that he had greatly pardoned,\r\nhe grew exacting. He mentioned his objections to some of Mr. Dartrey\r\nFenellan’s ideas.\r\n\r\nNesta replied: ‘I have this morning had two letters to make me happy.’\r\n\r\nA provoking evasion. He would rather have seen antagonism bridle and\r\nstiffen her figure. ‘Is one of them from that gentleman?’\r\n\r\n‘One is from my dear friend Louise de Seilles. She comes to me early\r\nnext month.’\r\n\r\n‘The other?’\r\n\r\n‘The other is also from a friend.’\r\n\r\n‘A dear friend?’\r\n\r\n‘Not so dear. Her letter gives me happiness.’\r\n\r\n‘She writes--not from France: from...? you tempt me to guess.’\r\n\r\n‘She writes to tell me, that Mr. Dartrey Fenellan has helped her in a\r\nway to make her eternally thankful.’\r\n\r\n‘The place she writes from is...?’\r\n\r\nThe drag of his lips betrayed his enlightenment insisted on doubting. He\r\ndemanded assurance.\r\n\r\n‘It matters in no degree,’ she said.\r\n\r\nDudley ‘thought himself excusable for inquiring.’\r\n\r\nShe bowed gently.\r\n\r\nThe stings and scorpions and degrading itches of this nest of wealthy\r\nBohemians enraged him.\r\n\r\n‘Are you--I beg to ask--are you still:--I can hardly think it--Nesta!--I\r\nsurely have a claim to advise:--it cannot be with your mother’s\r\nconsent:--in communication, in correspondence with...?’\r\n\r\nAgain she bowed her head; saying: ‘It is true.’\r\n\r\n‘With that person?’\r\n\r\nHe could not but look the withering disgust of the modern world in a\r\nconservative gentleman who has been lured to go with it a little way,\r\nonly to be bitten. ‘I decline to believe it,’ he said with forcible\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n‘She is married,’ was the rather shameless, exasperating answer.\r\n\r\n‘Married or not!’ he cried, and murmured: ‘I have borne--. These may be\r\nMr. Dartrey Fenellan’s ideas; they are not mine. I have--Something\r\nat least is due to me: Ask any lady:--there are clergymen, I know,\r\nclergymen who are for uplifting--quite right, but not associating:--to\r\ncall one of them a friend! Ask any lady, any! Your mother...’\r\n\r\n‘I beg you will not distress my mother,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘I beg to know whether this correspondence is to continue?’ said Dudley.\r\n\r\n‘All my life, if I do not feel dishonoured by it.’\r\n\r\n‘You are.’ He added hastily: ‘Counsels of prudence--there is not a lady\r\nliving who would tell you otherwise. At all events, in public opinion,\r\nif it were known--and it would certainly be known,--a lady, wife\r\nor spinster, would suffer--would not escape the--at least shadow of\r\ndefilement from relationship, any degree of intimacy with... hard words\r\nare wholesome in such a case: “touch pitch,” yes! My sense is coherent.’\r\n\r\n‘Quite,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\n‘And you do not agree with me?’\r\n\r\n‘I do not.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you pretend to be as able to judge as I?’\r\n\r\n‘In this instance, better.’\r\n\r\n‘Then I retire. I cannot retain my place here. You may depend upon it,\r\nthe world is not wrong when it forbids young ladies to have cognizance\r\nof women leading disorderly lives.’\r\n\r\n‘Only the women, Mr. Sowerby?’\r\n\r\n‘Men, too, of course.’\r\n\r\n‘You do not exclude the men from Society.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! one reads that kind of argument in books.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! the worthy books, then. I would read them, if I could find them.’\r\n\r\n‘They are banned by self-respecting readers.’\r\n\r\n‘It grieves me to think differently.’\r\n\r\nDudley looked on this fair girl, as yet innocent girl; and contrasting\r\nher with the foulness of the subject she dared discuss, it seemed\r\nto him, that a world which did not puff at her and silence, if not\r\nextinguish, was in a state of liquefaction.\r\n\r\nRemembering his renewed repentances his absence, he said: ‘I do hope\r\nyou may come to see, that the views shared by your mother and me are not\r\nerroneous.’\r\n\r\n‘But do not distress her,’ Nesta implored him. ‘She is not well. When\r\nshe has grown stronger, her kind heart will move her to receive the\r\nlady, so that she may not be deprived of the society of good women. I\r\nshall hope she will not disapprove of me. I cannot forsake a friend.’\r\n\r\n‘I beg to say good-bye,’ said Dudley.\r\n\r\nShe had seen a rigidity smite him as she spoke; and so little startling\r\nwas it, that she might have fancied it expected, save for her knowing\r\nherself too serious to have played at wiles to gain her ends.\r\n\r\nHe ‘wished her prudent advisers.’\r\n\r\nShe thanked him. ‘In a few days, Louise de Seilles will be here.’\r\n\r\nA Frenchwoman and Papist! was the interjection of his twist of brows.\r\n\r\nSurely I must now be free? she thought when he had covered his farewell\r\nunder a salutation regretful in frostiness.\r\n\r\nA week later, she had the embrace of her Louise, and Armandine was made\r\nhappy with a piece of Parisian riband.\r\n\r\nWinter was rapidly in passage: changes were visible everywhere; Earth\r\nand House of Commons and the South London borough exhibited them; Mrs.\r\nBurman was the sole exception. To the stupefaction of physicians, in a\r\nmanner to make a sane man ask whether she was not being retained as an\r\ninstrument for one of the darker purposes of Providence--and where are\r\nwe standing if we ask such things?--she held on to her thread of life.\r\n\r\nFebruary went by. And not a word from Themison; nor from Carling, nor\r\nfrom the Rev. Groseman Buttermore, nor from Jarniman. That is to say,\r\nthe two former accepted invitations to grand dinners; the two latter\r\nacknowledged contributions to funds in which they were interested; but\r\nthey had apparently grown to consider Mrs. Burman as an establishment,\r\none of our fixtures. On the other hand, there was nothing to be feared\r\nfrom her. Lakelands feared nothing: the entry into Lakelands was decreed\r\nfor the middle of April. Those good creatures enclosed the poor woman\r\nand nourished her on comfortable fiction. So the death of the member\r\nfor the South London borough (fifteen years younger than the veteran in\r\nmaladies) was not to be called premature, and could by no possibility\r\nlead to an exposure of the private history of the candidate for his\r\nvacant seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. AN EXPIATION\r\n\r\nNataly had fallen to be one of the solitary who have no companionship\r\nsave with the wound they nurse, to chafe it rather than try at healing.\r\nSo rational a mind as she had was not long in outliving mistaken\r\nimpressions; she could distinguish her girl’s feeling, and her aim; she\r\ncould speak on the subject with Dartrey; and still her wound bled on.\r\nLouise de Seilles comforted her partly, through an exaltation of Nesta.\r\nMademoiselle, however, by means of a change of tone and look when Dudley\r\nSowerby and Dartrey Fenellan were the themes, showed a too pronounced\r\npreference of the more unstable one:--or rather, the man adventurous out\r\nof the world’s highways, whose image, as husband of such a daughter\r\nas hers, smote the wounded mother with a chillness. Mademoiselle’s\r\noccasional thrill of fervency in an allusion to Dartrey, might have\r\ntempted a suspicious woman to indulge suppositions, accounting for the\r\nyoung Frenchwoman’s novel tenderness to England, of which Nesta proudly,\r\nvery happily boasted. The suspicion proposed itself, and was rejected:\r\nfor not even the fever of an insane body could influence Nataly’s\r\ngenerous character, to let her moods divert and command her thoughts of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts were at this time singularly lucid upon everything about\r\nher; with the one exception of the reason why she had come to favour\r\nDudley, and how it was she had been smitten by that woman at Brighton\r\nto see herself in her position altogether with the world’s relentless,\r\nunexamining hard eyes. Bitterness added, of Mrs. Marsett: She is made\r\nan honest woman!--And there was a strain of the lower in Nataly, to\r\nreproach the girl for causing the reflection to be cast on the unwedded.\r\nOtherwise her mind was open; she was of aid to Victor in his confusion\r\nover some lost Idea he had often touched on latterly. And she was the\r\none who sent him ahead at a trot under a light, by saying: ‘You would\r\nfound a new and more stable aristocracy of the contempt of luxury’ when\r\nhe talked of combatting the Jews with a superior weapon. That being,\r\nin fact, as Colney Durance had pointed out to him, the weapon of\r\nself-conquest used by them ‘before they fell away to flesh-pottery.’\r\nWas it his Idea? He fancied an aching at the back of his head when\r\nhe speculated. But his Idea had been surpassingly luminous, alive, a\r\ncreation; and this came before him with the yellow skin of a Theory,\r\nbred, born of books. Though Nataly’s mention of the aristocracy of\r\nself-denying discipline struck a Lucifer in his darkness.\r\n\r\nNesta likewise helped: but more in what she did than in what she said:\r\nshe spoke intelligently enough to make him feel a certain increase of\r\nalarm, amounting to a cursory secret acknowledgement of it, both at her\r\ndealings with Dudley and with himself. She so quietly displaced the\r\nlady visiting him at the City offices. His girl’s disregard of\r\nhostile weather, and her company, her talk, delighted him: still\r\nhe remonstrated, at her coming daily. She came: nor was there an\r\ninstigation on the part of her mother, clearly none: her mother asked\r\nhim once whether he thought she met the dreadful Brighton woman. His\r\nFredi drove constantly to walk back beside him Westward, as he loved\r\nto do whenever it was practicable; and exceeding the flattery of his\r\npossession of the gallant daughter, her conversation charmed him to\r\nforget a disappointment caused by the defeat and entire exclusion of the\r\nlady visiting him so complimentarily for his advice on stocks, shares,\r\nmines, et caetera. The lady resisted; she was vanquished, as the shades\r\nare displaced by simple apparition of daylight.\r\n\r\nHis Fredi was like the daylight to him; she was the very daylight to his\r\nmind, whatsoever their theme of converse for by stimulating that ready\r\nbut vagrant mind to quit the leash of the powerful senses and be\r\na ethereally excursive, she gave him a new enjoyment; which led to\r\nreflections--a sounding of Nature, almost a question to her, on the\r\nverge of a doubt. Are we, in fact, harmonious with the Great Mother when\r\nwe yield to the pressure of our natures for indulgence? Is she, when\r\ntranslated into us, solely the imperious appetite? Here was Fredi, his\r\nlittle Fredi--stately girl that she had grown, and grave, too, for all\r\nher fun and her sail on wings--lifting him to pleasures not followed\r\nby clamorous, and perfectly satisfactory, yet discomposingly violent,\r\nappeals to Nature. They could be vindicated. Or could they, when they\r\nwould not bear a statement of the case? He could not imagine himself\r\nstating it namelessly to his closest friend--not to Simeon Fenellan. As\r\nfor speaking to Dartrey, the notion took him with shivers:--Young Dudley\r\nwould have seemed a more possible confidant:--and he represented the\r\nPuritan world.--And young Dudley was getting over Fredi’s infatuation\r\nfor the woman she had rescued: he was beginning to fancy he saw a right\r\nenthusiasm in it;--in the abstract; if only the fair maid would drop\r\nan unseemly acquaintance. He had called at the office to say so. Victor\r\nstammered the plea for him.\r\n\r\n‘Never, dear father,’ came the smooth answer: a shocking answer in\r\ncontrast with the tones. Her English was as lucid as her eyes when she\r\ncontinued up to the shock she dealt: ‘Do not encourage a good man to\r\nwaste his thoughts upon me. I have chosen my mate, and I may never marry\r\nhim. I do not know whether he would marry me. He has my soul. I have no\r\nshame in saying I love him. It is to love goodness, greatness of heart.\r\nHe is a respecter of women--of all women; not only the fortunate. He is\r\nthe friend of the weaker everywhere. He has been proved in fire. He does\r\nnot sentimentalize over poor women, as we know who scorns people for\r\ndoing:--and that is better than hardness, meaning kindly. He is not one\r\nof the unwise advocates. He measures the forces against them. He reads\r\ntheir breasts. He likes me. He is with me in my plans. He has not said,\r\nhas not shown, he loves me. It is too high a thought for me until I hear\r\nit.’\r\n\r\n‘Has your soul!’ was all that Victor could reply, while the whole\r\nconception of Lakelands quaked under the crumbling structure.\r\n\r\nRemonstrance, argument, a word for Dudley, swelled to his lips and sank\r\nin dumbness. Her seeming intuition--if it was not a perception--of\r\nthe point where submission to the moods of his nature had weakened his\r\ncharacter, and required her defence of him, struck Victor with a serious\r\nfear of his girl: and it was the more illuminatingly damnatory for being\r\nrecognized as the sentiment which no father should feel. He tried to\r\nthink she ought not to be so wise of the things of the world. An effort\r\nto imagine a reproof, showed him her spirit through her eyes: in her\r\ndeeds too: she had already done work on the road:--Colney Durance,\r\nDartrey Fenellan, anything but sentimentalists either of them, strongly\r\nbacking her, upholding her. Victor could no longer so naturally name her\r\nFredi.\r\n\r\nHe spoke it hastily, under plea of some humorous tenderness, when\r\nhe ventured. When Dudley, calling on him in the City to discuss the\r\ncandidature for the South London borough, named her Fredi, that he\r\nmight regain a vantage of familiarity by imitating her father, it struck\r\nVictor as audacious. It jarred in his recollection, though the heir of\r\nthe earldom spoke in the tone of a lover, was really at high pitch. He\r\nappeared to be appreciating her, to have suffered stings of pain; he\r\noffered himself; he made but one stipulation. Victor regretfully assured\r\nhim, he feared he could do nothing. The thought of his entry into\r\nLakelands, with Nesta Victoria refusing the foundation stone of the\r\nplace, grew dim.\r\n\r\nBut he was now canvassing for the Borough, hearty at the new business\r\nas the braced swimmer on seas, which instantly he became, with an end in\r\nview to be gained.\r\n\r\nLate one April night, expecting Nataly to have gone to bed, and Nesta\r\nto be waiting for him, he reached home, and found Nataly in her\r\nsitting-room alone. ‘Nesta was tired,’ she said: ‘we have had a scene;\r\nshe refuses Mr. Sowerby; I am sick of pressing it; he is very much in\r\nearnest, painfully; she blames him for disturbing me; she will not\r\nsee the right course:--a mother reads her daughter! If my girl has not\r\nguidance!--she means rightly, she is rash.’\r\n\r\nNataly could not utter all that her insaneness of feeling made her think\r\nwith regard to Victor’s daughter--daughter also of the woman whom her\r\nhard conscience accused of inflammability. ‘Here is a note from Dr.\r\nThemison, dear.’\r\n\r\nVictor seized it, perused, and drew the big breath.\r\n\r\n‘From Themison,’ he said; he coughed.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t think to deceive me,’ said she. ‘I have not read the contents, I\r\nknow them.’\r\n\r\n‘The invitation at last, for to-morrow, Sunday, four P.M. Odd, that next\r\nday at eight of the evening I shall be addressing our meeting in the\r\nTheatre. Simeon speaks. Beaves Urmsing insists on coming, Tory though he\r\nis. Those Tories are jollier fellows than--well, no wonder! There will\r\nbe no surgical... the poor woman is very low. A couple of days at the\r\noutside. Of course, I go.’\r\n\r\n‘Hand me the note, dear.’\r\n\r\nIt had to be given up, out of the pocket.\r\n\r\n‘But,’ said Victor, ‘the mention of you is merely formal.’\r\n\r\nShe needed sleep: she bowed her head.\r\n\r\nNataly was the first at the breakfast-table in the morning, a fair\r\nSunday morning. She was going to Mrs. John Cormyn’s Church, and she\r\nasked Nesta to come with her.\r\n\r\nShe returned five minutes before the hour of lunch, having left Nesta\r\nwith Mrs. John. Louise de Seilles undertook to bring Nesta home at\r\nthe time she might choose. Fenellan, Mr. Pempton, Peridon and Catkin,\r\nlunched and chatted. Nataly chatted. At a quarter to three o’clock\r\nVictor’s carriage was at the door. He rose: he had to keep an\r\nappointment. Nataly said to him publicly: ‘I come too.’ He stared and\r\nnodded. In the carriage, he said: ‘I’m driving to the Gardens, for a\r\nstroll, to have a look at the beasts. Sort of relief. Poor crazy woman!\r\nHowever, it ‘s a comfort to her: so...!’\r\n\r\n‘I like to see them,’ said Nataly. ‘I shall see her. I have to do it.’\r\n\r\nUp to the gate of the Gardens Victor was arguing to dissuade his dear\r\nsoul from this very foolish, totally unnecessary, step. Alighting, he\r\nput the matter aside, for good angels to support his counsel at the\r\nfinal moment.\r\n\r\nBears, lions, tigers, eagles, monkeys: they suggested no more than he\r\nwould have had from prints; they sprang no reflection, except, that the\r\ncoming hour was a matter of indifference to them. They were about him,\r\nand exercised so far a distraction. He took very kindly to an old mother\r\nmonkey, relinquishing her society at sight of Nataly’s heave of the\r\nbosom. Southward, across the park, the dread house rose. He began\r\nquoting Colney Durance with relish while sarcastically confuting the\r\ncynic, who found much pasture in these Gardens. Over Southward, too, he\r\nwould be addressing a popular assembly to-morrow evening. Between now\r\nand then there was a ditch to jump. He put on the sympathetic face\r\nof grief. ‘After all, a caged wild beast hasn’t so bad a life,’ he\r\nsaid.--To be well fed while they live, and welcome death as a release\r\nfrom the maladies they develop in idleness, is the condition of wealthy\r\npeople:--creatures of prey? horrible thought! yet allied to his Idea,\r\nit seemed. Yes, but these good caged beasts here set them an example,\r\nin not troubling relatives and friends when they come to the gasp! Mrs.\r\nBurman’s invitation loomed as monstrous--a final act of her cruelty.\r\nHis skin pricked with dews. He thought of Nataly beside him, jumping the\r\nditch with him, as a relief--if she insisted on doing it. He hoped she\r\nwould not, for the sake of her composure.\r\n\r\nIt was a ditch void of bottom. But it was a mere matter of an hour,\r\nless. The state of health of the invalid could bear only a few minutes.\r\nIn any case, we are sure that the hour will pass. Our own arrive?\r\nCertainly.\r\n\r\n‘Capital place for children,’ he exclaimed. And here startlingly before\r\nhim in the clusters of boys and girls, was the difference between young\r\nones and their elders feeling quite as young: the careless youngsters\r\nhave not to go and sit in the room with a virulent old woman, and\r\nexpress penitence and what not, and hear words of pardon, after their\r\nholiday scamper and stare at the caged beasts.\r\n\r\nAttention to the children precipitated him upon acquaintances, hitherto\r\ncleverly shunned. He nodded them off, after the brightest of greetings.\r\n\r\nSuch anodyne as he could squeeze from the incarcerated wild creatures,\r\nwas exhausted. He fell to work at Nataly’s ‘aristocracy of the contempt\r\nof luxury’; signifying, that we the wealthy will not exist to pamper\r\nflesh, but we live for the promotion of brotherhood:--ay, and that our\r\nEngland must make some great moral stand, if she is not to fall to\r\nthe rear and down. Unuttered, it caught the skirts of the Idea: it\r\nevaporated when spoken. Still, this theme was almost an exorcism of Mrs.\r\nBurman. He consulted his watch. ‘Thirteen minutes to four. I must be\r\npunctual,’ he said. Nataly stepped faster.\r\n\r\nSeated in the carriage, he told her he had never felt the horror of that\r\nplace before. ‘Put me down at the corner of the terrace, dear: I won’t\r\ndrive to the door.’\r\n\r\n‘I come with you, Victor,’ she replied.\r\n\r\nAfter entreaties and reasons intermixed, to melt her resolve, he saw she\r\nwas firm: and he asked himself, whether he might not be constitutionally\r\nbetter adapted to persuade than to dissuade. The question thumped.\r\nHaving that house of drugs in view, he breathed more freely for the\r\nprospect of feeling his Nataly near him beneath the roof.\r\n\r\n‘You really insist, dear love?’ he appealed to her: and her answer:\r\n‘It must be,’ left no doubt: though he chose to say: ‘Not because of\r\nstanding by me?’ And she said: ‘For my peace, Victor.’ They stepped to\r\nthe pavement. The carriage was dismissed.\r\n\r\nSeventeen houses of the terrace fronting the park led to the funereal\r\none: and the bell was tolled in the breast of each of the couple\r\nadvancing with an air of calmness to the inevitable black door.\r\n\r\nJarniman opened it. ‘His mistress was prepared to see them.’--Not\r\nlike one near death.--They were met in the hall by the Rev. Groseman\r\nButtermore. ‘You will find a welcome,’ was his reassurance to them:\r\ngently delivered, on the stoop of a large person. His whispered tones\r\nwere more agreeably deadening than his words.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttermore ushered them upstairs.\r\n\r\n‘Can she bear it?’ Victor said, and heard: ‘Her wish ten minutes.’\r\n\r\n‘Soon over,’ he murmured to Nataly, with a compassionate exclamation for\r\nthe invalid.\r\n\r\nThey rounded the open door. They were in the drawing-room. It was\r\nfurnished as in the old time, gold and white, looking new; all the same\r\nas of old, save for a division of silken hangings; and these were pale\r\nblue: the colour preferred by Victor for a bedroom. He glanced at the\r\nceiling, to bathe in a blank space out of memory. Here she lived,--here\r\nshe slept, behind the hangings. There was refreshingly that little\r\ndifference in the arrangement of the room. The corner Northward was\r\noccupied by the grand piano; and Victor had an inquiry in him:--tuned?\r\nHe sighed, expecting a sight to come through the hangings. Sensible that\r\nNataly trembled, he perceived the Rev. Groseman Buttermore half across a\r\nheap of shawl-swathe on the sofa.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman was present; seated. People may die seated; she had always\r\ndisliked the extended posture; except for the night’s rest, she used to\r\nsay; imagining herself to be not inviting the bolt of sudden death, in\r\nher attitude when seated by day:--and often at night the poor woman\r\nhad to sit up for the qualms of her dyspepsia!--But I ‘m bound to think\r\nhumanely, be Christian, be kind, benignant, he thought, and he fetched\r\nthe spirit required, to behold her face emerge from a pale blue silk\r\nveiling; as it were, the inanimate wasted led up from the mould by\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. Buttermore signalled to them to draw near.\r\n\r\nWasted though it was, the face of the wide orbits for sunken eyes was\r\ndistinguishable as the one once known. If the world could see it and\r\nhear, that it called itself a man’s wife! She looked burnt out.\r\n\r\nTwo chairs had been sent to front the sofa. Execution there! Victor\r\nthought, and he garrotted the unruly mind of a man really feeling\r\ndevoutness in the presence of the shadow thrown by the dread Shade.\r\n\r\n‘Ten minutes,’ Mr. Buttermore said low, after obligingly placing them on\r\nthe chairs.\r\n\r\nHe went. They were alone with Mrs. Burman.\r\n\r\nNo voice came. They were unsure of being seen by the floating grey\r\nof eyes patient to gaze from their vast distance. Big drops fell from\r\nNataly’s. Victor heard the French timepiece on the mantel-shelf, where a\r\nfamiliar gilt Cupid swung for the seconds: his own purchase. The time of\r\nday on the clock was wrong; the Cupid swung.\r\n\r\nNataly’s mouth was taking breath of anguish at moments. More than a\r\nminute of the terrible length of the period of torture must have gone:\r\ntwo, if not three.\r\n\r\nA quaver sounded. ‘You have come.’ The voice was articulate, thinner\r\nthan the telephonic, trans-Atlantic by deep-sea cable.\r\n\r\nVictor answered: ‘We have.’\r\n\r\nAnother minute must have gone in the silence. And when we get to five\r\nminutes we are on the descent, rapidly counting our way out of the\r\nhouse, into the fresh air, where we were half an hour back, among those\r\nhappy beasts in the pleasant Gardens!\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman’s eyelids shut. ‘I said you would come.’\r\n\r\nVictor started to the fire-screen. ‘Your sight requires protection.’\r\n\r\nShe dozed. ‘And Natalia Dreighton!’ she next said.\r\n\r\nThey were certainly now on the five minutes. Now for the slide downward\r\nand outward! Nataly should never have been allowed to come.\r\n\r\n‘The white waistcoat!’ struck his ears.\r\n\r\n‘Old customs with me, always!’ he responded. ‘The first of April,\r\nalways. White is a favourite. Pale blue, too. But I fear--I hope you\r\nhave not distressing nights? In my family we lay great stress on the\r\nnights we pass. My cousins, the Miss Duvidneys, go so far as to judge of\r\nthe condition of health by the nightly record.’\r\n\r\n‘Your daughter was in their house.’\r\n\r\nShe knew everything!\r\n\r\n‘Very fond of my daughter--the ladies,’ he remarked.\r\n\r\n‘I wish her well.’\r\n\r\n‘You are very kind.’\r\n\r\nMrs. Burman communed within or slept. ‘Victor, Natalia, we will pray,’\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nHer trembling hands crossed their fingers. Nataly slipped to her knees.\r\n\r\nThe two women mutely praying, pulled Victor into the devotional hush. It\r\nacted on him like the silent spell of service in a Church. He forgot\r\nhis estimate of the minutes, he formed a prayer, he refused to hear the\r\nCupid swinging, he droned a sound of sentences to deaden his ears. Ideas\r\nof eternity rolled in semblance of enormous clouds. Death was a black\r\nbird among them. The piano rang to Nataly’s young voice and his. The\r\ngold and white of the chairs welcomed a youth suddenly enrolled\r\namong the wealthy by an enamoured old lady on his arm. Cupid\r\ntick-ticked.--Poor soul! poor woman! How little we mean to do harm when\r\nwe do an injury! An incomprehensible world indeed at the bottom and at\r\nthe top. We get on fairly at the centre. Yet it is there that we do the\r\nmischief making such a riddle of the bottom and the top. What is to be\r\nsaid! Prayer quiets one. Victor peered at Nataly fervently on her knees\r\nand Mrs. Burman bowed over her knotted fingers. The earnestness of both\r\nenforced an effort at a phrased prayer in him. Plungeing through a wave\r\nof the scent of Marechale, that was a tremendous memory to haul him\r\nbackward and forward, he beheld his prayer dancing across the furniture;\r\na diminutive thin black figure, elvish, irreverent, appallingly unlike\r\nhis proper emotion; and he brought his hands just to touch, and got to\r\nthe edge of his chair, with split knees. At once the figure vanished.\r\nBy merely looking at Nataly, he passed into her prayer. A look at Mrs.\r\nBurman made it personal, his own. He heard the cluck of a horrible sob\r\ncoming from him. After a repetition of his short form of prayer deeply\r\nstressed, he thanked himself with the word ‘sincere,’ and a queer\r\nside-thought on our human susceptibility to the influence of posture. We\r\nare such creatures.\r\n\r\nNataly resumed her seat. Mrs. Burman had raised her head. She said: ‘We\r\nare at peace.’ She presently said, with effort: ‘It cannot last with me.\r\nI die in nature’s way. I would bear forgiveness with me, that I may have\r\nit above. I give it here, to you, to all. My soul is cleansed, I trust.\r\nMuch was to say. My strength will not. Unto God, you both!’\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Groseman Buttermore was moving on slippered step to the back of\r\nthe sofa. Nataly dropped before the unseeing, scarce breathing, lady\r\nfor an instant. Victor murmured an adieu, grateful for being spared the\r\nceremonial shake of hands. He turned away, then turned back, praying for\r\npower to speak, to say that he had found his heart, was grateful, would\r\nhold her in memory. He fell on a knee before her, and forgot he had done\r\nso when he had risen. They were conducted by the Rev. gentleman to the\r\nhall-door: he was not speechless. Jarniman uttered something.\r\n\r\nThat black door closed behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. THE NIGHT OF THE GREAT UNDELIVERED SPEECH\r\n\r\nTo a man issuing from a mortuary where a skull had voice, London may\r\nbe restorative as air of Summer Alps. It is by contrast blooming life.\r\nObserve the fellowship of the houses shoulder to shoulder; and that\r\nstraight ascending smoke of the preparation for dinner; and the good\r\npoliceman yonder, blessedly idle on an orderly Sabbath evening; and the\r\nfamilies of the minor people trotting homeward from the park to tea;\r\nhere and again an amiable carriage of the superimposed people driving\r\nto pay visits; they are so social, friendly, inviting to him; they strip\r\nhim of the shroud, sing of the sweet old world. He cannot but be moved\r\nto the extremity of the charitableness neighbouring on tears.\r\n\r\nA stupefaction at the shock of the positive reminder, echo of the fact\r\nstill shouting in his breast, that he had seen Mrs. Burman, and that the\r\ninterview was over--the leaf turned and the book shut held Victor in a\r\nsilence until his gratefulness to London City was borne down by the more\r\nhuman burst of gratitude to the dying woman, who had spared him, as much\r\nas she could, a scene of the convulsive pathetic, and had not called on\r\nhim for any utterance of penitence. That worm-like thread of voice came\r\nup to him still from sexton-depths: it sounded a larger forgiveness\r\nwithout the word. He felt the sorrow of it all, as he told Nataly; at\r\nthe same time bidding her smell ‘the marvellous oxygen of the park.’ He\r\ndeclared it to be quite equal to Lakelands.\r\n\r\nShe slightly pressed his arm for answer. Perhaps she did not feel\r\nso deeply? She was free of the horrid associations with the scent of\r\nMarechale. At any rate, she had comported herself admirably!\r\n\r\nVictor fancied he must have shuddered when he passed by Jarniman at the\r\ndoor, who was almost now seeing his mistress’s ghost--would have the\r\nprivilege to-morrow. He called a cab and drove to Mrs. John Cormyn’s,\r\nat Nataly’s request, for Nesta and mademoiselle: enjoying the Londonized\r\nodour of the cab. Nataly did not respond to his warm and continued\r\neulogies of Mrs. Burman; she rather disappointed him. He talked of the\r\ngold and white furniture, he just alluded to the Cupid: reserving his\r\nmental comment, that the time-piece was all astray, the Cupid regular on\r\nthe swing:--strange, touching, terrible, if really the silly gilt\r\nfigure symbolized!... And we are a silly figure to be sitting in a cab\r\nimagining such things!--When Nesta and mademoiselle were opposite, he\r\nhad the pleasure to see Nataly take Nesta’s hand and hold it until they\r\nreached home. Those two talking together in the brief words of their\r\ndeep feeling, had tones that were singularly alike: the mezzo-soprano\r\nfilial to the divine maternal contralto. Those two dear ones mounted to\r\nNataly’s room.\r\n\r\nThe two dear ones showed themselves heart in heart together once more;\r\neach looked the happier for it. Dartrey was among their dinner-guests,\r\nand Nataly took him to her little blue-room before she went to bed. He\r\ndid not speak of their conversation to Victor, but counselled him to\r\nkeep her from excitement. ‘My dear fellow, if you had seen her with Mrs.\r\nBurman!’ Victor said, and loudly praised her coolness. She was never\r\nbelow a situation, he affirmed.\r\n\r\nHe followed his own counsel to humour his Nataly. She began panting at\r\na word about Mr. Barmby’s ready services. When, however, she related\r\nthe state of affairs between Dartrey and Nesta, by the avowal of each\r\nof them to her, he said, embracing her: ‘Your wisdom shall guide us, my\r\nlove,’ and almost extinguished a vexation by concealing it.\r\n\r\nShe sighed: ‘If one could think, that a girl with Nesta’s revolutionary\r\nideas of the duties of women, and their powers, would be safe--or at all\r\nrightly guided by a man who is both one of the noblest and the wildest\r\nin the ideas he entertains!’\r\n\r\nVictor sighed too. He saw the earldom, which was to dazzle the gossips,\r\ncrack on the sky in a futile rocket-bouquet.\r\n\r\nShe was distressed; she moaned: ‘My girl! my girl: I should wish to\r\nleave her with one who is more fixed--the old-fashioned husband. New\r\nideas must come in politics, but in Society!--and for women! And the\r\nyoung having heads, are the most endangered. Nesta vows her life to it!\r\nDartrey supports her!’\r\n\r\n‘See Colney,’ said Victor. ‘Odd, Colney does you good; some queer way he\r\nhas. Though you don’t care for his RIVAL TONGUES,--and the last number\r\nwas funny, with Semhians on the Pacific, impressively addressing a\r\nfarewell to his cricket-bat, before he whirls it away to Neptune--and\r\nthe blue hand of his nation’s protecting God observed to seize it!--Dead\r\nfailure with the public, of course! However, he seems to seem wise with\r\nyou. The poor old fellow gets his trouncing from the critics monthly.\r\nSee Colney to-morrow, my love. Now go to sleep. We have got over the\r\nworst. I speak at my Meeting to-morrow and am a champagne-bottle of\r\nnotes and points for them.’\r\n\r\nHis lost Idea drew close to him in sleep: or he thought so, when awaking\r\nto the conception of a people solidified, rich and poor, by the common\r\npride of simple manhood. But it was not coloured, not a luminous globe:\r\nand the people were in drab, not a shining army on the march to meet the\r\nFuture. It looked like a paragraph in a newspaper, upon which a Leading\r\nArticle sits, dutifully arousing the fat worm of sarcastic humour under\r\nthe ribs of cradled citizens, with an exposure of its excellent folly.\r\nHe would not have it laughed at; still he could not admit it as more\r\nthan a skirt of the robe of his Idea. For let none think him a mere City\r\nmerchant, millionnaire, boon-fellow, or music-loving man of the world.\r\nHe had ideas to shoot across future Ages;--provide against the shrinkage\r\nof our Coal-beds; against, and for, if you like, the thickening,\r\njumbling, threatening excess of population in these Islands, in Europe,\r\nAmerica, all over our habitable sphere. Now that Mrs. Burman, on her\r\nway to bliss, was no longer the dungeon-cell for the man he would\r\nshow himself to be, this name for successes, corporate nucleus of the\r\nenjoyments, this Victor Montgomery Radnor, intended impressing himself\r\nupon the world as a factory of ideas. Colney’s insolent charge, that\r\nthe English have no imagination--a doomed race, if it be true!--would\r\nbe confuted. For our English require but the lighted leadership to come\r\ninto cohesion, and step ranked, and chant harmoniously the song of their\r\nbenevolent aim. And that astral head giving, as a commencement, example\r\nof the right use of riches, the nation is one, part of the riddle of the\r\nfuture solved.\r\n\r\nSurely he had here the Idea? He had it so warmly, that his bath-water\r\nheated. Only the vision was wanted.\r\n\r\nOn London Bridge he had seen it--a great thing done to the flash of\r\nbrilliant results. That was after a fall.\r\n\r\nThere had been a fall also of the scheme of Lakelands.\r\n\r\nCome to us with no superstitious whispers of indications and\r\nsignifications in the fall!--But there had certainly been a moral fall,\r\nfully to the level of the physical, in the maintaining of that scheme of\r\nLakelands, now ruined by his incomprehensible Nesta--who had saved him\r\nfrom falling further. His bath-water chilled. He jumped out and rubbed\r\nfuriously with his towels and flesh-brushes, chasing the Idea for simple\r\nwarmth, to have Something inside him, to feel just that sustainment;\r\nwith the cry: But no one can say I do not love my Nataly! And he tested\r\nit to prove it by his readiness to die for her: which is heroically\r\neasier than the devotedly living, and has a weight of evidence in our\r\ninternal Courts for surpassing the latter tedious performance.\r\n\r\nHis Nesta had knocked Lakelands to pieces. Except for the making\r\nof money, the whole year of an erected Lakelands, notwithstanding\r\nuninterrupted successes, was a blank. Or rather we have to wish it were\r\na blank. The scheme departs: payment for the enlisted servants of it\r\nis in prospect. A black agent, not willingly enlisted, yet pointing to\r\nproofs of service, refuses payment in ordinary coin; and we tell him we\r\nowe him nothing, that he is not a man of the world, has no understanding\r\nof Nature: and still the fellow thumps and alarums at a midnight door we\r\nare astonished to find we have in our daylight house. How is it? Would\r\nother men be so sensitive to him? Victor was appeased by the assurance\r\nof his possession of an exceptionally scrupulous conscience; and he\r\nsettled the debate by thinking: ‘After all, for a man like me, battling\r\nincessantly, a kind of Vesuvius, I must have--can’t be starved, must be\r\nfed--though, pah! But I’m not to be questioned like other men.--But how\r\nabout an aristocracy of the contempt of distinctions?--But there is\r\nno escaping distinctions! my aristocracy despises indulgence.--And\r\nindulges?--Say, an exceptional nature! Supposing a certain beloved woman\r\nto pronounce on the case?--She cannot: no woman can be a just judge of\r\nit.’---He cried: My love of her is testified by my having Barmby handy\r\nto right her to-day, tomorrow, the very instant the clock strikes the\r\nhour of my release!\r\n\r\nMention of the clock swung that silly gilt figure. Victor entered into\r\nit, condemned to swing, and be a thrall. His intensity of sensation\r\nlaunched him on an eternity of the swinging in ridiculous nakedness\r\nto the measure of time gone crazy. He had to correct a reproof of Mrs.\r\nBurman, as the cause of the nonsense. He ran down to breakfast, hopeing\r\nhe might hear of that clock stopped, and that sickening motion with it.\r\n\r\nAnother letter from the Sanfredini in Milan, warmly inviting to her\r\nvilla over Como, acted on him at breakfast like the waving of a banner.\r\n‘We go,’ Victor said to Nataly, and flattered-up a smile about her\r\nlips--too much a resurrection smile. There was talk of the Meeting\r\nat the theatre: Simeon Fenellan had spoken there in the cause of the\r\ndeceased Member, was known, and was likely to have a good reception. Fun\r\nand enthusiasm might be expected.\r\n\r\n‘And my darling will hear her husband speak to-night,’ he whispered as\r\nhe was departing; and did a mischief, he had to fear, for a shadowy\r\nknot crossed Nataly’s forehead, she seemed paler. He sent back Nesta and\r\nmademoiselle, in consequence, at the end of the Green Park.\r\n\r\nTheir dinner-hour was early; Simeon Fenellan, Colney Durance, and\r\nMr. Peridon--pleasing to Nataly for his faithful siege of the French\r\nfortress--were the only guests. When they rose, Nataly drew Victor\r\naside. He came dismayed to Nesta. She ran to her mother. ‘Not hear papa\r\nspeak? Oh, mother, mother! Then I stay with her. But can’t she come? He\r\nis going to unfold ideas to us. There!’\r\n\r\n‘My naughty girl is not to poke her fun at orators,’ Nataly said. ‘No,\r\ndearest; it would agitate me to go. I’m better here. I shall be at peace\r\nwhen the night is over.’\r\n\r\n‘But you will be all alone here, dear mother.’\r\n\r\nNataly’s eyes wandered to fall on Colney. He proposed to give her his\r\ncompany. She declined it. Nesta ventured another entreaty, either that\r\nshe might be allowed to stay or have her mother with her at the Meeting.\r\n\r\n‘My love,’ Nataly said, ‘the thought of the Meeting--’ She clasped at\r\nher breast; and she murmured: ‘I shall be comforted by your being with\r\nhim. There is no danger there. But I shall be happy, I shall be at peace\r\nwhen this night is over.’\r\n\r\nColney persuaded her to have him for companion. Mr. Peridon, who was to\r\nhave driven with Nesta and mademoiselle, won admiration by proposing to\r\nstay for an hour and play some of Mrs. Radnor’s favourite pieces. Nesta\r\nand Victor overbore Nataly’s objections to the lover’s generosity. So\r\nMr. Peridon was left. Nesta came hurrying back from the step of the\r\ncarriage to kiss her mother again, saying: ‘Just one last kiss, my own!\r\nAnd she’s not to look troubled. I shall remember everything to tell my\r\nown mother. It will soon be over.’\r\n\r\nHer mother nodded; but the embrace was passionate.\r\n\r\nNesta called her father into the passage, bidding him prohibit any\r\ndelivery to her mother of news at the door. ‘She is easily startled now\r\nby trifles--you have noticed?’\r\n\r\nVictor summoned his recollections and assured her he had noticed, as he\r\nbelieved he had ‘The dear heart of her is fretting for the night to be\r\nover! And think! seven days, and she is in Lakelands. A fortnight, and\r\nwe have our first Concert. Durandarte! Oh, the dear heart ‘ll be at\r\npeace when I tell her of a triumphant Meeting. Not a doubt of that, even\r\nthough Colney turns the shadow of his back on us.’\r\n\r\n‘One critic the less for you!’ said Nesta. Skepsey was to meet her\r\ncarriage at the theatre.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, Victor and Simeon Fenellan were proceeding\r\nthitherward on foot.\r\n\r\n‘I have my speech,’ said Victor. ‘You prepare the way for me, following\r\nour influential friend Dubbleson; Colewort winds up; any one else\r\nthey shout for. We shall have a great evening. I suspect I shall find\r\nThemison or Jarniman when I get home. You don’t believe in intimations?\r\nI’ve had crapy processions all day before my eyes. No wonder, after\r\nyesterday!’\r\n\r\n‘Dubbleson mustn’t drawl it out too long,’ said Fenellan.\r\n\r\n‘We ‘ll drop a hint. Where’s Dartrey?’\r\n\r\n‘He’ll come. He’s in one of his black moods: not temper. He’s got a\r\nnotion he killed his wife by dragging her to Africa with him. She was\r\nnot only ready to go, she was glad to go. She had a bit of the heroine\r\nin her and a certainty of tripping to the deuce if she was left to\r\nherself.’\r\n\r\n‘Tell Nataly that,’ said Victor. ‘And tell her about Dartrey. Harp on\r\nit. Once she was all for him and our girl. But it’s a woman--though the\r\ndearest! I defy any one to hit on the cause of their changes. We must\r\nmake the best of things, if we’re for swimming. The task for me to-night\r\nwill be, to keep from rolling out all I’ve got in my head. And I’m\r\nnot revolutionary, I’m for stability. Only I do see, that the firm\r\nstepping-place asks for a long stride to be taken. One can’t get the\r\nEnglish to take a stride--unless it’s for a foot behind them: bother\r\nold Colney! Too timid, or too scrupulous, down we go into the mire.\r\nThere!--But I want to say it! I want to save the existing order. I want,\r\nChristianity, instead of the Mammonism we ‘re threatened with. Great\r\nfortunes now are becoming the giants of old to stalk the land: or\r\nmediaeval Barons. Dispersion of wealth, is the secret. Nataly’s of that\r\nmind with me. A decent poverty! She’s rather wearying, wants a change.\r\nI’ve a steam-yacht in my eye, for next month on the Mediterranean. All\r\nour set. She likes quiet. I believe in my political recipe for it.’\r\n\r\nHe thumped on a method he had for preserving aristocracy--true\r\naristocracy, amid a positively democratic flood of riches.\r\n\r\n‘It appears to me, you’re on the road of Priscilla Graves and Pempton,’\r\nobserved Simeon. ‘Strike off Priscilla’s viands and friend Pempton’s\r\ncouple of glasses, and there’s your aristocracy established; but with\r\nrather a dispersed recognition of itself.’\r\n\r\n‘Upon my word, you talk like old Colney, except for a twang of your\r\nown,’ said Victor. ‘Colney sours at every fresh number of that Serial.\r\nThe last, with Delphica detecting the plot of Falarique, is really not\r\nso bad. The four disguised members of the Comedie Francaise on board the\r\nvessel from San Francisco, to declaim and prove the superior merits of\r\nthe Gallic tongue, jumped me to bravo the cleverness. And Bobinikine\r\nturning to the complexion of the remainder of cupboard dumplings\r\ndiscovered in an emigrant’s house-to-let! And Semhians--I forget what\r\nand Mytharete’s forefinger over the bridge of his nose, like a pensive\r\nvulture on the skull of a desert camel! But, I complain, there’s nothing\r\nto make the English love the author; and it’s wasted, he’s basted, and\r\nthe book ‘ll have no sale. I hate satire.’\r\n\r\n‘Rough soap for a thin skin, Victor. Does it hurt our people much?’\r\n\r\n‘Not a bit; doesn’t touch them. But I want my friends to succeed!’\r\n\r\nTheir coming upon Westminster Bridge changed the theme. Victor wished\r\nthe Houses of Parliament to catch the beams of sunset. He deferred to\r\nthe suggestion, that the Hospital’s doing so seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\n‘I’m always pleased to find a decent reason for what is,’ he said. Then\r\nhe queried: ‘But what is, if we look at it, and while we look, Simeon?\r\nShe may be going--or she’s gone already, poor woman! I shall have that\r\nscene of yesterday everlastingly before my eyes, like a drop-curtain.\r\nOnly, you know, Simeon, they don’t feel the end, as we in health\r\nimagine. Colney would say, we have the spasms and they the peace. I\r\n‘ve a mind to send up to Regent’s Park with inquiries. It would look\r\nrespectful. God forgive me!--the poor woman perverts me at every turn.\r\nThough I will say, a certain horror of death I had--she whisked me out\r\nof it yesterday. I don’t feel it any longer. What are you jerking at?’\r\n\r\n‘Only to remark, that if the thing’s done for us, we haven’t it so much\r\non our sensations.’\r\n\r\n‘More, if we’re sympathetic. But that compels us to be philosophic--or\r\nwho could live! Poor woman!’\r\n\r\n‘Waft her gently, Victor!’\r\n\r\n‘Tush! Now for the South side of the Bridges; and I tell you, Simeon,\r\nwhat I can’t mention to-night: I mean to enliven these poor dear people\r\non their forsaken South of the City. I ‘ve my scheme. Elected or not, I\r\nshall hardly be accused of bribery when I put down my first instalment.’\r\n\r\nFenellan went to work with that remark in his brain for the speech he\r\nwas to deliver. He could not but reflect on the genial man’s willingness\r\nand capacity to do deeds of benevolence, constantly thwarted by the\r\nposition into which he had plunged himself.\r\n\r\nThey were received at the verge of the crowd outside the theatre-doors\r\nby Skepsey, who wriggled, tore and clove a way for them, where all were\r\nobedient, but the numbers lumped and clogged. When finally they reached\r\nthe stage, they spied at Nesta’s box, during the thunder of the rounds\r\nof applause, after shaking hands with Mr. Dubbleson, Sir Abraham\r\nQuatley, Dudley Sowerby, and others; and with Beaves Urmsing--a\r\npolitician ‘never of the opposite party to a deuce of a funny\r\nfellow!--go anywhere to hear him,’ he vowed.\r\n\r\n‘Miss Radnor and Mademoiselle de Seilles arrived quite safely,’ said\r\nDudley, feasting on the box which contained them and no Dartrey Fenellan\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nNesta was wondering at Dartrey’s absence. Not before Mr. Dubbleson, the\r\nchairman, the ‘gentleman of local influence,’ had animated the drowsed\r\nwits and respiratory organs of a packed audience by yielding place to\r\nSimeon, did Dartrey appear. Simeon’s name was shouted, in proof of\r\nthe happy explosion of his first anecdote, as Dartrey took seat behind\r\nNesta. ‘Half an hour with the dear mother,’ he said.\r\n\r\nNesta’s eyes thanked him. She pressed the hand of a demure young woman\r\nsitting close behind. Louise de Seilles. ‘You know Matilda Pridden.’\r\n\r\nDartrey held his hand out. ‘Has she forgiven me?’\r\n\r\nMatilda bowed gravely, enfolding her affirmative in an outline of the\r\nno need for it, with perfect good breeding. Dartrey was moved to think\r\nSkepsey’s choice of a woman to worship did him honour. He glanced at\r\nLouise. Her manner toward Matilda Pridden showed her sisterly with\r\nNesta. He said: ‘I left Mr. Peridon playing.--A little anxiety to hear\r\nthat the great speech of the evening is done; it’s nothing else. I’ll\r\nrun to her as soon as it’s over.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, good of you! And kind of Mr. Peridon!’ She turned to Louise, who\r\nsmiled at the simple art of the exclamation, assenting.\r\n\r\nVictor below, on the stage platform, indicated the waving of a hand\r\nto them, and his delight at Simeon’s ringing points: which were, to\r\nDartrey’s mind, vacuously clever and crafty. Dartrey despised effects\r\nof oratory, save when soldiers had to be hurled on a mark--or citizens\r\nnerved to stand for their country.\r\n\r\nNesta dived into her father’s brilliancy of appreciation, a trifle\r\npained by Dartrey’s aristocratic air when he surveyed the herd of heads\r\nagape and another cheer rang round. He smiled with her, to be with her,\r\nat a hit here and there; he would not pretend an approval of this manner\r\nof winning electors to consider the country’s interests and their own.\r\nOne fellow in the crowded pit, affecting a familiarity with Simeon,\r\nthat permitted the taking of liberties with the orator’s Christian\r\nname, mildly amused him. He had no objection to hear ‘Simmy’ shouted, as\r\nLouise de Seilles observed. She was of his mind, in regard to the rough\r\nmachinery of Freedom.\r\n\r\nSkepsey entered the box.\r\n\r\n‘We shall soon be serious, Miss Nesta,’ he said, after a look at Matilda\r\nPridden.\r\n\r\nThere was a prolonged roaring--on the cheerful side.\r\n\r\n‘And another word about security that your candidate will keep his\r\npromises,’ continued Simeon: ‘You have his word, my friends!’ And he\r\ntold the story of the old Governor of Goa, who wanted money and summoned\r\nthe usurers, and they wanted security; whereupon he laid his Hidalgo\r\nhand on a cataract of Kronos-beard across his breast, and pulled\r\nforth three white hairs, and presented them: ‘And as honourably to\r\nthe usurious Jews as to the noble gentleman himself, that security was\r\naccepted!’\r\n\r\nEmerging from hearty clamours, the illustrative orator fell upon the\r\nquestion of political specifics:--Mr. Victor Radnor trusted to English\r\ngood sense too profoundly to be offering them positive cures, as they\r\nwould hear the enemy say he did. Yet a bit of a cure may be offered,\r\nif we ‘re not for pushing it too far, in pursuit of the science of\r\nspecifics, in the style of the foreign physician, probably Spanish,\r\nwho had no practice, and wished for leisure to let him prosecute his\r\nanatomical and other investigations to discover his grand medical\r\nnostrum. So to get him fees meanwhile he advertised a cure for\r\ndyspepsia--the resource of starving doctors. And sure enough his patient\r\ncame, showing the grand fat fellow we may be when we carry more of the\r\ndeciduously mortal than of the scraggy vital upon our persons. Any one\r\nat a glance would have prescribed water-cresses to him: water-cresses\r\nexclusively to eat for a fortnight. And that the good physician did.\r\nAway went his patient, returning at the end of the fortnight, lean, and\r\nwith the appetite of a Toledo blade for succulent slices. He vowed he\r\nwas the man. Our estimable doctor eyed him, tapped at him, pinched his\r\ntender parts; and making him swear he was really the man, and had eaten\r\nnothing whatever but unadulterated water-cresses in the interval, seized\r\non him in an ecstasy by the collar of his coat, pushed him into the\r\nsurgery, knocked him over, killed him, cut him up, and enjoyed the\r\nfelicity of exposing to view the very healthiest patient ever seen under\r\ndissecting hand, by favour of the fortunate discovery of the specific\r\nfor him. All to further science!--to which, in spite of the petitions\r\nof all the scientific bodies of the civilized world, he fell a martyr\r\non the scaffold, poor gentleman! But we know politics to be no such\r\nempirical science.\r\n\r\nSimeon ingeniously interwove his analogy. He brought it home to Beaves\r\nUrmsing, whose laugh drove any tone of apology out of it. Yet the orator\r\nwas asked: ‘Do you take politics for a joke, Simmy?’\r\n\r\nHe countered his questioner: ‘Just to liberate you from your moribund\r\nstate, my friend.’ And he told the story of the wrecked sailor, found\r\nlying on the sands, flung up from the foundered ship of a Salvation\r\ncaptain, and how, that nothing could waken him, and there he lay fit\r\nfor interment; until presently a something of a voice grew down into his\r\nears; and it was his old chum Polly, whom he had tied to a board to\r\ngive her a last chance in the surges; and Polly shaking the wet from her\r\nfeathers, and shouting: ‘Polly tho dram dry!’--which struck on the nob\r\nof Jack’s memory, to revive all the liquorly tricks of the cabin under\r\nSalvationism, and he began heaving, and at last he shook in a lazy way,\r\nand then from sputter to sputter got his laugh loose; and he sat up, and\r\ncried; ‘That did it! Now to business!’ for he was hungry. ‘And when I\r\ncatch the ring of this world’s laugh from you, my friend...!’ Simeon’s\r\napplication of the story was drowned.\r\n\r\nAfter the outburst, they heard his friend again interruptingly: ‘You\r\nkeep that tongue of yours from wagging, as it did when you got round the\r\nold widow woman for her money, Simmy!’\r\n\r\nVictor leaned forward. Simeon towered. He bellowed\r\n\r\n‘And you keep that tongue of yours from committing incest on a lie!’\r\n\r\nIt was like a lightning-flash in the theatre. The man went under.\r\nSimeon flowed. Conscience reproached him with the little he had done for\r\nVictor, and he had now his congenial opportunity.\r\n\r\nUp in the box, the powers of the orator were not so cordially esteemed.\r\nTo Matilda Pridden, his tales were barely decently the flesh and the\r\ndevil smothering a holy occasion to penetrate and exhort. Dartrey sat\r\nrigid, as with the checked impatience for a leap. Nesta looked at Louise\r\nwhen some one was perceived on the stage bending to her father: It\r\nwas Mr. Peridon; he never once raised his face. Apparently he was not\r\nintelligible or audible but the next moment Victor sprang erect. Dartrey\r\nquitted the box. Nesta beheld her father uttering hurried words to right\r\nand left. He passed from sight, Mr. Peridon with him; and Dartrey did\r\nnot return.\r\n\r\nNesta felt her father’s absence as light gone: his eyes rayed light.\r\nBesides she had the anticipation of a speech from him, that would win\r\nMatilda Pridden. She fancied Simeon Fenellan to be rather under the\r\nspell of the hilarity he roused. A gentleman behind him spoke in his\r\near; and Simeon, instead of ceasing, resumed his flow. Matilda Pridden’s\r\ngaze on him and the people was painful to behold: Nesta saw her mind.\r\nShe set herself to study a popular assembly. It could be serious to the\r\ncall of better leadership, she believed. Her father had been telling\r\nher of late of a faith he had in the English, that they (or so her\r\nintelligence translated his remarks) had power to rise to spiritual\r\nascendancy, and be once more the Islanders heading the world of a new\r\nepoch abjuring materialism--some such idea; very quickening to her,\r\nas it would be to this earnest young woman worshipped by Skepsey. Her\r\nfather’s absence and the continued shouts of laughter, the insatiable\r\nthirst for fun, darkened her in her desire to have the soul of the good\r\nworking sister refreshed. They had talked together; not much: enough for\r\neach to see at either’s breast the wells from the founts of life.\r\n\r\nThe box-door opened, Dartrey came in. He took her hand. She stood-up to\r\nhis look. He said to Matilda Pridden: ‘Come with us; she will need you.’\r\n\r\n‘Speak it,’ said Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe said to the other: ‘She has courage.’\r\n\r\n‘I could trust to her,’ Matilda Pridden replied.\r\n\r\nNesta read his eyes. ‘Mother?’\r\n\r\nHis answer was in the pressure.\r\n\r\n‘Ill?’\r\n\r\n‘No longer.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! Dartrey.’ Matilda Pridden caught her fast.\r\n\r\n‘I can walk, dear,’ Nesta said.\r\n\r\nDartrey mentioned her father.\r\n\r\nShe understood: ‘I am thinking of him.’\r\n\r\nThe words of her mother: ‘At peace when the night is over,’ rang. Along\r\nthe gassy passages of the back of the theatre, the sound coming from an\r\napplausive audience was as much a thunder as rage would have been. It\r\nwas as void of human meaning as a sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII. THE LAST\r\n\r\nIn the still dark hour of that April morning, the Rev. Septimus Barmby\r\nwas roused by Mr. Peridon, with a scribbled message from Victor, which\r\nhe deciphered by candlelight held close to the sheet of paper, between\r\nshort inquiries and communications, losing more and more the sense of\r\nit as his intelligence became aware of what dread blow had befallen the\r\nstricken man. He was bidden come to fulfil his promise instantly. He\r\nremembered the bearing of the promise. Mr. Peridon’s hurried explanatory\r\nnarrative made the request terrific, out of tragically lamentable. A\r\nsemblance of obedience had to be put on, and the act of dressing aided\r\nit. Mr. Barmby prayed at heart for guidance further.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen drove Westward, speaking little; they had the dry sob\r\nin the throat.\r\n\r\n‘Miss Radnor?’ Mr. Barmby asked.\r\n\r\n‘She is shattered; she holds up; she would not break down.’\r\n\r\n‘I can conceive her to possess high courage.’\r\n\r\n‘She has her friend Mademoiselle de Seilles.’\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby remained humbly silent. Affectionate deep regrets moved him\r\nto say: ‘A loss irreparable. We have but one voice of sorrow. And how\r\nsudden! The dear lady had no suffering, I trust.’\r\n\r\n‘She fell into the arms of Mr. Durance. She died in his arms. She\r\nwas unconscious, he says. I left her straining for breath. She said\r\n“Victor”; she tried to smile:--I understood I was not to alarm him.’\r\n\r\n‘And he too late!’\r\n\r\n‘He was too late, by some minutes.’\r\n\r\n‘At least I may comfort. Miss Radnor must be a blessing to him.’\r\n\r\n‘They cannot meet. Her presence excites him.’\r\n\r\nThat radiant home of all hospitality seemed opening on from darker\r\nchambers to the deadly dark. The immorality in the moral situation\r\ncould not be forgotten by one who was professionally a moralist. But an\r\nincorruptible beauty in the woman’s character claimed to plead for her\r\nmemory. Even the rigorous in defence of righteous laws are softened by\r\na sinner’s death to hear excuses, and may own a relationship, haply\r\nperceive the faint nimbus of the saint. Death among us proves us to be\r\nstill not so far from the Nature saying at every avenue to the mind:\r\n‘Earth makes all sweet.’\r\n\r\nMr. Durance had prophesied a wailful end ever to the carol of Optimists!\r\nYet it is not the black view which is the right view. There is one\r\nbetween: the path adopted by Septimus Barmby:--if he could but induce\r\nhis brethren to enter on it! The dreadful teaching of circumstances\r\nmight help to the persuading of a fair young woman, under his\r\ndirection... having her hand disengaged. Mr. Barmby started himself in\r\nthe dream of his uninterred passion for the maiden: he chased it, seized\r\nit, hurled it hence, as a present sacrilege:--constantly, and at the\r\npitch of our highest devotion to serve, are we assailed by the tempter!\r\nIs it, that the love of woman is our weakness? For if so, then would\r\na celibate clergy have grant of immunity. But, alas, it is not so with\r\nthem! We have to deplore the hearing of reports too credible. Again we\r\nare pushed to contemplate woman as the mysterious obstruction to the\r\nperfect purity of soul. Nor is there a refuge in asceticism. No\r\nmore devilish nourisher of pride do we find than in pain voluntarily\r\nembraced. And strangely, at the time when our hearts are pledged to\r\nthoughts upon others, they are led by woman to glance revolving upon\r\nourself, our vile self! Mr. Barmby clutched it by the neck.\r\n\r\nLight now, as of a strong memory of day along the street, assisted him\r\nto forget himself at the sight of the inanimate houses of this London,\r\nall revealed in a quietness not less immobile than tombstones of an\r\nunending cemetery, with its last ghost laid. Did men but know it!--The\r\nhabitual necessity to amass matter for the weekly sermon, set him noting\r\nhis meditative exclamations, the noble army of platitudes under haloes,\r\nof good use to men: justifiably turned over in his mind for their good.\r\nHe had to think, that this act of the justifying of the act reproached\r\nhim with a lack of due emotion, in sympathy with agonized friends truly\r\ndear. Drawing near the hospitable house, his official and a cordial\r\nemotion united, as we see sorrowful crape-wreathed countenances. His\r\nheart struck heavily when the house was visible.\r\n\r\nCould it be the very house? The look of it belied the tale inside. But\r\nthat threw a ghostliness on the look.\r\n\r\nSome one was pacing up and down. They greeted Dudley Sowerby. His\r\nability to speak was tasked. They gathered, that mademoiselle and ‘a\r\nMiss Pridden’ were sitting with Nesta, and that their services in a\r\ncrisis had been precious. At such times, one of them reflected, woman\r\nhas indeed her place: when life’s battle waxes red. Her soul must be\r\ncapable of mounting to the level of the man’s, then? It is a lesson!\r\n\r\nDudley said he was waiting for Dr. Themison to come forth. He could not\r\ntear himself from sight of the house.\r\n\r\nThe door opened to Dr. Themison departing, Colney Durance and Simeon\r\nFenellan bare-headed. Colney showed a face with stains of the lashing of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nDr. Themison gave his final counsels. ‘Her father must not see her. For\r\nhim, it may have to be a specialist. We will hope the best. Mr. Dartrey\r\nFenellan stays beside him:--good. As to the ceremony he calls for, a\r\nform of it might soothe:--any soothing possible! No music. I will return\r\nin a few hours.’\r\n\r\nHe went on foot.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby begged advice from Colney and Simeon concerning the message\r\nhe had received--the ceremony requiring his official presidency. Neither\r\nof them replied. They breathed the morning air, they gave out long-drawn\r\nsighs of relief, looking on the trees of the park.\r\n\r\nA man came along the pavement, working slow legs hurriedly. Simeon ran\r\ndown to him.\r\n\r\n‘Humour, as much as you can,’ Colney said to Mr. Barmby. ‘Let him\r\nimagine.’\r\n\r\n‘Miss Radnor?’\r\n\r\n‘Not to speak of her.’\r\n\r\n‘The daughter he so loves?’\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby’s tender inquisitiveness was unanswered. Were they inducing\r\nhim to mollify a madman? But was it possible to associate the idea of\r\nmadness with Mr. Radnor?\r\n\r\nSimeon ran back. ‘Jarniman,’ he remarked. ‘It’s over!’\r\n\r\n‘Now!’ Colney’s shoulders expressed the comment. ‘Well, now, Mr. Barmby,\r\nyou can do the part desired. Come in. It’s morning!’ He stared at the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nAll except Dudley passed in.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby wanted more advice, his dilemma being acute. It was\r\nmoderated, though not more than moderated, when he was informed of\r\nthe death of Mrs. Burman Radnor; an event that occurred, according to\r\nJarniman’s report, forty-five minutes after Skepsey had a second time\r\ncalled for information of it at the house in Regent’s Park--five hours\r\nand a half, as Colney made his calculation, after the death of Nataly.\r\nHe was urged by some spur of senseless irony to verify the calculation\r\nand correct it in the minutes.\r\n\r\nDudley crossed the road. No sign of the awful interior was on any of the\r\nwindows of the house either to deepen awe or relieve. They were blank\r\nas eyeballs of the mindless. He shivered. Death is our common cloak; but\r\nCalamity individualizes, to set the unwounded speculating whether indeed\r\na stricken man, who has become the cause of woeful trouble, may not be\r\npointing a moral. Pacing on the Park side of the house, he saw Skepsey\r\ndrive up and leap out with a gentleman, Mr. Radnor’s lawyer. Could it\r\nbe, that there was no Will written? Could a Will be executed now? The\r\nmoral was more forcibly suggested. Dudley beheld this Mr. Victor Radnor\r\nsuccessful up all the main steps, persuasive, popular, brightest of the\r\nelect of Fortune, felled to the ground within an hour, he and all his\r\nhouse! And if at once to pass beneath the ground, the blow would have\r\nseemed merciful for him. Or if, instead of chattering a mixture of the\r\nrational and the monstrous, he had been heard to rave like the utterly\r\ndistraught. Recollection of some of the things he shouted, was an\r\nanguish: A notion came into the poor man, that he was the dead one of\r\nthe two, and he cried out: ‘Cremation? No, Colney’s right, it robs us of\r\nour last laugh. I lie as I fall.’ He ‘had a confession for his Nataly,\r\nfor her only, for no one else.’ He had ‘an Idea.’ His begging of Dudley\r\nto listen without any punctilio (putting a vulgar oath before it), was\r\nthe sole piece of unreasonableness in the explanation of the idea: and\r\nthat was not much wilder than the stuff Dudley had read from reports of\r\nRadical speeches. He told Dudley he thought him too young to be ‘best\r\nman to a widower about to be married,’ and that Barmby was ‘coming all\r\nhaste to do the business, because of no time to spare.’\r\n\r\nDudley knew but the half, and he did not envy Dartrey Fenellan his task\r\nof watching over the wreck of a splendid intelligence, humouring and\r\nrestraining. According to the rumours, Mr. Radnor had not shown the\r\nsymptoms before the appearance of his daughter. For awhile he hung,\r\nand then fell, like an icicle. Nesta came with a cry for her father. He\r\nrose: Dartrey was by. Hugged fast in iron muscles, the unhappy creature\r\nraved of his being a caged lion. These things Dudley had heard in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThere are scenes of life proper to the grave-cloth.\r\n\r\nNataly’s dead body was her advocate with her family, with friends, with\r\nthe world. Victor had more need of a covering shroud to keep calamity\r\nrespected. Earth makes all sweet: and we, when the privilege is granted\r\nus, do well to treat the terribly stricken as if they had entered to the\r\nbosom of earth.\r\n\r\nThat night’s infinite sadness was concentrated upon Nesta. She had need\r\nof her strength of mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe night went past as a year. The year followed it as a refreshing\r\nnight. Slowly lifting her from our abysses, it was a good angel to the\r\ngirl. Permission could not be given for her to see her father. She had a\r\nhome in the modest home of Louise de Seilles on the borders of Dauphins;\r\nand with French hearts at their best in winningness around her, she\r\nlearned again, as an art, the natural act of breathing calmly; she had\r\nby degrees a longing for the snow-heights. When her imagination could\r\nperch on them with love and pride, she began to recover the throb for\r\na part in human action. It set her nature flowing to the mate she had\r\nchosen, who was her counsellor, her supporter, and her sword. She had\r\nawakened to new life, not to sink back upon a breast of love, though\r\nthoughts of the lover were as blows upon strung musical chords of her\r\nbosom. Her union with Dartrey was for the having an ally and the being\r\nan ally, in resolute vision of strife ahead, through the veiled dreams\r\nthat bear the blush. This was behind a maidenly demureness. Are not\r\nyoung women hypocrites? Who shall fathom their guile! A girl with a\r\npretty smile, a gentle manner, a liking for wild flowers up on the\r\nrocks; and graceful with resemblances to the swelling proportions of\r\ngarden-fruits approved in young women by the connoisseur eye of man;\r\ndistinctly designed to embrace the state of marriage, that she might (a\r\ngirl of singularly lucid and receptive eyes) the better give battle to\r\nmen touching matters which they howl at an eccentric matron for naming.\r\nSo it was. And the yielding of her hand to Dartrey, would have appeared\r\nat that period of her revival, as among the baser compliances of the\r\nfleshly, if she had not seen in him, whom she owned for leader, her\r\nfellow soldier, warrior friend, hero, of her own heart’s mould, but a\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nShe was on Como, at the villa of the Signora Giulia Sanfredini, when\r\nDudley’s letter reached her, with the supplicating offer of the share of\r\nhis earldom. An English home meanwhile was proposed to her at the house\r\nof his mother the Countess. He knew that he did not write to a brilliant\r\nheiress. The generosity she had always felt that he possessed, he thus\r\nproved in figures. They are convincing and not melting. But she was\r\nmoved to tears by his goodness in visiting her father, as well as by the\r\nhopeful news he sent. He wrote delicately, withholding the title of her\r\nfather’s place of abode. There were expectations of her father’s perfect\r\nrecovery; the signs were auspicious; he appeared to be restored to\r\nthe ‘likeness to himself’ in the instances Dudley furnished:--his\r\nappointment with him for the flute-duet next day; and particularly his\r\nenthusiastic satisfaction with the largeness and easy excellent service\r\nof the residence ‘in which he so happily found himself established.’ He\r\nheld it to be, ‘on the whole, superior to Lakelands.’ The smile and the\r\ntear rolled together in Nesta reading these words. And her father spoke\r\nrepeatedly of longing to embrace his Fredi, of the joy her last letter\r\nhad given him, of his intention to send an immediate answer: and he\r\nshowed Dudley a pile of manuscript ready for the post. He talked of\r\npublic affairs, was humorous over any extravagance or eccentricity\r\nin the views he took; notably when he alluded to his envy of little\r\nSkepsey. He said he really did envy; and his daughter believed it and\r\nsaw fair prospects in it.\r\n\r\nHer grateful reply to the young earl conveyed all that was perforce\r\nungentle, in the signature of the name of Nesta Victoria Fenellan:--a\r\nname he was to hear cited among the cushioned conservatives, and plead\r\nfor as he best could under a pressure of disapprobation, and compelled\r\nesteem, and regrets.\r\n\r\nThe day following the report of her father’s wish to see her, she and\r\nher husband started for England. On that day, Victor breathed his last.\r\nDudley had seen the not hopeful but an ominous illumination of the\r\nstricken man; for whom came the peace his Nataly had in earth. Often did\r\nNesta conjure up to vision the palpitating form of the beloved mother\r\nwith her hand at her mortal wound in secret through long years of the\r\nwearing of the mask to keep her mate inspirited. Her gathered knowledge\r\nof things and her ruthless penetrativeness made it sometimes hard for\r\nher to be tolerant of a world, whose tolerance of the infinitely evil\r\nstamped blotches on its face and shrieked in stains across the skin\r\nbeneath its gallant garb. That was only when she thought of it as the\r\nworld condemning her mother. She had a husband able and ready, in return\r\nfor corrections of his demon temper, to trim an ardent young woman’s\r\nfanatical overflow of the sisterly sentiments; scholarly friends, too,\r\nfor such restrainings from excess as the mind obtains in a lamp\r\nof History exhibiting man’s original sprouts to growth and fitful\r\ncontinuation of them. Her first experience of the grief that is\r\nin pleasure, for those who have passed a season, was when the old\r\nConcert-set assembled round her. When she heard from the mouth of\r\na living woman, that she had saved her from going under the world’s\r\nwaggon-wheels, and taught her to know what is actually meant by the good\r\nliving of a shapely life, Nesta had the taste of a harvest happiness\r\nricher than her recollection of the bride’s, though never was bride in\r\nfuller flower to her lord than she who brought the dower of an equal\r\nvaliancy to Dartrey Fenellan. You are aware of the reasons, the many,\r\nwhy a courageous young woman requires of high heaven, far more than the\r\ncommendably timid, a doughty husband. She had him; otherwise would that\r\npuzzled old world, which beheld her step out of the ranks to challenge\r\nit, and could not blast her personal reputation, have commissioned a paw\r\nto maul her character, perhaps instructing the gossips to murmur of her\r\nparentage. Nesta Victoria Fenellan had the husband who would have the\r\nworld respectful to any brave woman. This one was his wife.\r\n\r\nDaniel Skepsey rejoices in service to his new master, owing to the\r\nscientific opinion he can at any moment of the day apply for, as to the\r\nmilitary defences of the country; instead of our attempting to arrest\r\nthe enemy by vociferations of persistent prayer:--the sole point of\r\ndifference between him and his Matilda; and it might have been fatal but\r\nthat Nesta’s intervention was persuasive. The two members of the Army\r\nfirst in the field to enrol and give rank according to the merits\r\nof either, to both sexes, were made one. Colney Durance (practically\r\ncynical when not fancifully, men said) stood by Skepsey at the altar.\r\nHis published exercises in Satire produce a flush of the article in the\r\nReviews of his books. Meat and wine in turn fence the Hymen beckoning\r\nPriscilla and Mr. Pempton. The forms of Religion more than the Channel’s\r\ndivision of races keep Louise de Seilles and Mr. Peridon asunder: and\r\nin the uniting of them Colney is interested, because it would have so\r\npleased the woman of the loyal heart no longer beating. He let Victor’s\r\nend be his expiation and did not phrase blame of him. He considered the\r\nshallowness of the abstract Optimist exposed enough in Victor’s history.\r\nHe was reconciled to it when, looking on their child, he discerned, that\r\nfor a cancelling of the errors chargeable to them, the father and mother\r\nhad kept faith with Nature.\r\n\r\n     ETEXT EDITOR’S BOOKMARKS\r\n\r\n     Admiration of an enemy or oppressor doing great deeds\r\n     All of us an ermined owl within us to sit in judgement\r\n     An incomprehensible world indeed at the bottom and at the top\r\n     Aristocratic assumption of licence\r\n     Arrest the enemy by vociferations of persistent prayer\r\n     Ask not why, where reason never was\r\n     Belief in the narrative by promoting nausea in the audience\r\n     But what is it we do (excepting cricket, of course)\r\n     Cannot be any goodness unless it is a practiced goodness\r\n     Claim for equality puts an end to the priceless privileges\r\n     Consent of circumstances\r\n     Consent to take life as it is\r\n     Continued trust in the man--is the alternative of despair\r\n     Country prizing ornaments higher than qualities\r\n     Cover of action as an escape from perplexity\r\n     Critical fashion of intimates who know as well as hear\r\n     Death is our common cloak;
