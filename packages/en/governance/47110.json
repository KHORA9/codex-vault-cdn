Y.:\r\n  1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe English speaking people have been a race of pamphleteers. Whenever\r\na question—religious, political, military or personal—has interested\r\nthe general public, it has occasioned a war of pamphlets, which,\r\nhowever partisan and transitory, were in a manner photographs of the\r\npublic opinion, and as such have been used and valued by students and\r\npublicists.\r\n\r\nThe rarity and consequent difficulty of reaching this class of\r\nliterature has been, however, a great obstacle to its use as sources\r\nof history. The name of pamphlet tells the purpose of these little\r\npublications. Written hurriedly, to effect a purpose for which there\r\nis not enough time or matter for a more elaborate volume, they are\r\nthrown by after a brief circulation and before a decade has passed, the\r\nedition has disappeared, and if any are still in existence, they are\r\nonly to be found in the few public and private libraries which have\r\ntaken the trouble to secure these fugitive leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe recognized value of these tractates in England has led to very\r\nextensive republications; and the _Harleian Miscellany_, the _Somers\r\nTracts_, the issues of the Roxburghe, Bannatyne, Maitland, Chetham,\r\nCamden and Percy societies and the reprints of Halliwell, Collier, and\r\nM’Culloch, not to mention many minor collections, have placed several\r\nthousand of them within the reach of every one. But in America few\r\nattempts have been made to collect this kind of literature—Peter Force\r\nreprinted a series of pamphlets on the early settlement of the United\r\nStates and a work of similar scope on Canada, containing reprints\r\nof the so called “Jesuit Relations” was printed under the patronage\r\nof the Canadian government. John Wingate Thornton and Frank Moore\r\nhave collected a number of the patriotic sermons preached before and\r\nduring the Revolutionary war. Franklin B. Hough republished a series\r\nof the funeral sermons and eulogies on the death of Washington, and\r\nJames Spear Loring did the same for the orations delivered in Boston\r\nfrom 1770 to 1852. Samuel G. Drake reprinted a collection of tracts\r\nrelating to King Philip’s war, Joseph Sabin issued a series relating\r\nto the propagation of the gospel among the New England Indians, and\r\nWilliam H. Whitmore edited, for the Prince Society, a number relating\r\nto the governorship of Sir Edmund Andros—but these are the only\r\nattempts worth mentioning to systematically gather these leaflets of\r\nour history, and which have singularly neglected those bearing on\r\npolitics and government, in which we have so largely originated the\r\ntrue theories and methods.\r\n\r\nWhen the student or historian comes to examine the earlier pamphlet\r\nliterature of our country he encounters the greatest difficulty in\r\ntheir use. The lack of communication between the colonies or states,\r\nwith its consequent localization of the pamphlet; the small edition\r\ncaused by the high price of paper, which at that time was the costly\r\nelement in the production of books; the little value attached by each\r\ngeneration to the pamphlets of its own time; the subsequent wars,\r\nwith the destruction and high price of old paper that came with them,\r\nand the general disregard of historical material that existed for\r\nmany years after the stirring times that occasioned these arguments,\r\nhave all tended to make these tracts almost impossible to consult;\r\nand any one desiring to examine the original editions of the thirteen\r\npamphlets contained in this volume would be compelled to visit the\r\npublic libraries in the cities of Washington, Philadelphia, New York,\r\nAlbany and Boston, while it would take a life time of patient searching\r\nand waiting to collect them from the second-hand booksellers and\r\nauction-rooms, at prices that few would care to pay.\r\n\r\nAs the rarity of these pamphlets has caused their neglect, so also has\r\ntheir anonymous publication. It was a time of literary masks, and\r\nwe often find, like the knights of old, that when their masks were\r\nremoved, they had concealed our ablest statesmen, one of whom wrote of\r\nhis anonymous pamphlet, “If the reasoning in the pamphlet you allude to\r\nis just, it will have its effect on candid and discerning minds;—if\r\nweak and inconclusive, my name cannot render it otherwise,” but it is\r\ncertain, whatever the effect at the moment, that more attention and\r\ncare would have been given these works by succeeding generations had\r\nthey borne the name of one of the makers of our nation, rather than the\r\npseudonymous mask which gave no clue to its authorship.\r\n\r\nIn America, we are too apt to forget the losing side of a question.\r\nFew to-day know of the intense struggle that took place over the\r\nratification of our constitution, or realize that the adoption of a\r\ngovernment which has worked so successfully, met with the strongest\r\nopposition from such men as Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, George\r\nMason, George Clinton, Samuel Chase, Elbridge Gerry, Albert Gallatin,\r\nJames Monroe and others, while many equally famous were either neutral\r\nor gave it but lukewarm support. If the great fear and prediction of\r\nthese men—that the general government would entirely subvert the state\r\ngovernments, with a consequent loss of personal freedom—has not been\r\nrealized, it will nevertheless be seen in the following pages that many\r\nof their objections were embodied in the future amendments, and the\r\ndisregard of others has occasioned some of our most serious national\r\nquestions. If this collection presents a greater number of federal\r\nthan anti-federal arguments, it is only in the proportion in which the\r\nlatter was overborne by the former, both in men and writings.\r\n\r\nOf all these partisan writings _The Federalist_ has hitherto been\r\nalmost the only known argument of those which for nine months kept\r\nthe printers busy and the people in a turmoil, though the twenty-nine\r\neditions of that work attest the value and interest of that class of\r\nwritings. That these essays equal that great series is not claimed, but\r\nI believe, nevertheless, that they, by their simpler and more popular\r\ntreatment of the question, exerted quite as much influence as that\r\n“judicious and ingenious writer,” who was “not well calculated for the\r\ncommon people,” and therefore deserve in this centennial year a place\r\non the shelf of the publicist or student, with that “political classic”\r\nof Hamilton, Madison and Jay.\r\n\r\n PAUL LEICESTER FORD.\r\n\r\n 97 CLARK STREET,\r\n BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n   Page 274, line 1, for mine read mind.\r\n    ”   275,  ”  14,  ”  cause read clause.\r\n    ”   277,  ”   8,  ”  Richard Harry Lee read Richard Henry Lee.\r\n    ”   396,  ”  28,  ”  la substitute /\r\n    ”   407,  ”  38,  ”  substitute /\r\n    ”   409,  ”  31,  ”  propounded read proposed.\r\n    ”   409,  ”  36,  ”  Pilsner read Pelsue.\r\n    ”   412,  ”  21,  ”  J.

Gerry\r\n  made himself conspicuous in the contest in Massachusetts over the\r\n  ratification, and though not elected to the State Convention, was\r\n  requested by them to attend and answer questions. His life, by James\r\n  T. Austin, (Boston, 1828), makes no mention of this pamphlet.\r\n\r\n  “E. G. has come out as a _Columbian Patriot_—a pitiful performance.\r\n  The author sinks daily in public esteem, and his bantling goes\r\n  unnoticed.”—Rufus King to John Alsop, March 2d, 1788.\r\n\r\n  The first edition of this pamphlet was printed without a title page,\r\n  or imprint, and an examination of the Massachusetts newspapers shows\r\n  it was never for sale; making it probable that it was printed for\r\n  Gerry, and not for general circulation. Greenleaf reprinted it in\r\n  New York, for the [Anti] Federal Committee, who distributed sixteen\r\n  hundred and thirty copies to the local county committees of that\r\n  State.\r\n\r\n  “We have received yours by a Columbian Patriot—a well composed piece\r\n  but in a style too sublime and florid for the common people in this\r\n  part of the country.”—Albany Committee to N. Y. Committee, April\r\n  12th, 1788.\r\n\r\n  P. L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nMankind may amuse themselves with theoretick systems of liberty, and\r\ntrace its social and moral effects on sciences, virtue, industry and\r\nevery improvement of which the human mind is capable; but we can\r\nonly discern its true value by the practical and wretched effects\r\nof slavery; and thus dreadfully will they be realized, when the\r\ninhabitants of the Eastern States are dragging out a miserable\r\nexistence, _only_ on the gleanings of their fields; and the Southern,\r\nblessed with a softer and more fertile climate, are languishing in\r\nhopeless poverty; and when asked, what is become of the flower of their\r\ncrop, and the rich produce of their farms—they may answer in the\r\nhapless stile of the Man of _La Mancha_,—“The steward of my Lord has\r\nseized and sent it to _Madrid_.”——Or, in the more literal language of\r\ntruth, The _exigencies_ of government require that the collectors of\r\nthe revenue should transmit it to the _Federal City_.\r\n\r\nAnimated with the firmest zeal for the interest of this country, the\r\npeace and union of the American States, and the freedom and happiness\r\nof a people who have made the most costly sacrifices in the cause\r\nof liberty,—who have braved the power of Britain, weathered the\r\nconvulsions of war, and waded thro’ the blood of friends and foes to\r\nestablish their independence and to support the freedom of the human\r\nmind; I cannot silently [2] witness this degradation without calling\r\non them, before they are compelled to blush at their own servitude,\r\nand to turn back their languid eyes on their lost liberties—to\r\nconsider, that the character of nations generally changes at the\r\nmoment of revolution.——And when patriotism is discountenanced and\r\npublick virtue becomes the ridicule of the sycophant—when every man\r\nof liberality, firmness and penetration who cannot lick the hand\r\nstretched out to oppress, is deemed an enemy to the State—then is the\r\ngulph of despotism set open, and the grades to slavery, though rapid,\r\nare scarce perceptible—then genius drags heavily its iron chain\r\n—science is neglected, and real merit flies to the shades for security\r\nfrom reproach—the mind becomes enervated, and the national character\r\nsinks to a kind of apathy with only energy sufficient to curse the\r\nbreast that gave it milk, and as an elegant writer observes, “To bewail\r\nevery new birth as an increase of misery, under a government where the\r\nmind is necessarily debased, and talents are seduced to become the\r\npanegyrists of usurpation and tyranny.” He adds, “that even sedition\r\nis not the most indubitable enemy to the publick welfare; but that\r\nits most dreadful foe is despotism which always changes the character\r\nof nations for the worse, and is productive of nothing but vice, that\r\nthe tyrant no longer excites to the pursuits of glory or virtue; it\r\nis not talents, it is baseness and servility that he cherishes, and\r\nthe weight of arbitrary power destroys the spring of emulation.”(1)\r\nIf such is the influence of government on the character and manners,\r\nand undoubtedly the observation is just, must we not subscribe to the\r\nopinion of the celebrated _Abbé Mablé_? “That there are disagreeable\r\nseasons in the unhappy situation of human affairs, when policy requires\r\nboth the intention and the power of doing mischief to be punished; and\r\nwhen the senate proscribed the memory of _Cæsar_ they ought to have\r\nput _Anthony_ to death, and extinguished the hopes of _Octavius_.”\r\nSelf defence is a primary law of nature, which no subsequent law of\r\nsociety can abolish; this primæval principle, the immediate gift of\r\nthe Creator, obliges every one to remonstrate against the strides of\r\nambition, and a wanton lust of domination, and to resist the first\r\napproaches of tyranny, which at this day threaten to sweep away\r\nthe rights for which the brave sons of America have fought with an\r\nheroism scarcely paralleled even in ancient republicks. [3] It may be\r\nrepeated, they have purchased it with their blood, and have gloried\r\nin their independence with a dignity of spirit, which has made them\r\nthe admiration of philosophy, the pride of America, and the wonder of\r\nEurope. It has been observed, with great propriety, that “the virtues\r\nand vices of a people when a revolution happens in their government,\r\nare the measure of the liberty or slavery they ought to expect—An\r\nheroic love for the publick good, a profound reverence for the laws,\r\na contempt of riches, and a noble haughtiness of soul, are the only\r\nfoundations of a free government.”(2) Do not their dignified principles\r\nstill exist among us? Or are they extinguished in the breasts of\r\nAmericans, whose fields have been so recently crimsoned to repel the\r\npotent arm of a foreign Monarch, who had planted his engines of slavery\r\nin every city, with design to erase the vestiges of freedom in this his\r\nlast asylum. It is yet to be hoped, for the honour of human nature,\r\nthat no combinations either foreign or domestick have thus darkned\r\nthis Western hemisphere.—On these shores freedom has planted her\r\nstandard, diped in the purple tide that flowed from the veins of her\r\nmartyred heroes; and here every uncorrupted American yet hopes to see\r\nit supported by the vigour, the justice, the wisdom and unanimity of\r\nthe people, in spite of the deep-laid plots, the secret intrigues, or\r\nthe bold effrontery of those interested and avaricious adventurers for\r\nplace, who intoxicated with the ideas of distinction and preferment\r\nhave prostrated every worthy principle beneath the shrine of ambition.\r\nYet these are the men who tell us republicanism is dwindled into\r\ntheory—that we are incapable of enjoying our liberties—and that we\r\nmust have a master.——Let us retrospect the days of our adversity,\r\nand recollect who were then our friends; do we find them among the\r\nsticklers for aristocratick authority? No, they were generally the same\r\nmen who now wish to save us from the distractions of anarchy on the one\r\nhand, and the jaws of tyranny on the other; where then were the class\r\nwho now come forth importunately urging that our political salvation\r\ndepends on the adoption of a system at which freedom spurns?—Were not\r\nsome of them hidden in the corners of obscurity, and others wrapping\r\nthemselves in the bosom of our enemies for safety? Some of them\r\nwere in the arms of infancy; and others speculating for fortune, by\r\nsporting with public money; while a few, a very few of them [4] were\r\nmagnanimously defending their country, and raising a character, which I\r\npray heaven may never be sullied by aiding measures derogatory to their\r\nformer exertions. But the revolutions in principle which time produces\r\namong mankind, frequently exhibits the most mortifying instances\r\nof human weakness; and this alone can account for the extraordinary\r\nappearance of a few names, once distinguished in the honourable walks\r\nof patriotism, but now found in the list of the Massachusetts assent to\r\nthe ratification of a Constitution, which, by the undefined meaning of\r\nsome parts, and the ambiguities of expression in others, is dangerously\r\nadapted to the purposes of an immediate _aristocratic tyranny_; that\r\nfrom the difficulty, if not impracticability of its operation, must\r\nsoon terminate in the most _uncontrouled despotism_.\r\n\r\nAll writers on government agree, and the feelings of the human mind\r\nwitness the truth of these political axioms, that man is born free and\r\npossessed of certain unalienable rights—that government is instituted\r\nfor the protection, safety and happiness of the people, and not for\r\nthe profit, honour, or private interest of any man, family, or class\r\nof men——That the origin of all power is in the people, and that\r\nthey have an incontestible right to check the creatures of their own\r\ncreation, vested with certain powers to guard the life, liberty and\r\nproperty of the community: And if certain selected bodies of men,\r\ndeputed on these principles, determine contrary to the wishes and\r\nexpectations of their constituents, the people have an undoubted right\r\nto reject their decisions, to call for a revision of their conduct, to\r\ndepute others in their room, or if they think proper, to demand further\r\ntime for deliberation on matters of the greatest moment: it therefore\r\nis an unwarrantable stretch of authority or influence, if any methods\r\nare taken to preclude this peaceful and reasonable mode of enquiry\r\nand decision. And it is with inexpressible anxiety, that many of the\r\nbest friends of the Union of the States—to the peaceable and equal\r\nparticipation of the rights of nature, and to the glory and dignity of\r\nthis country, behold the insiduous arts, and the strenuous efforts of\r\nthe partisans of arbitrary power, by their vague definitions of the\r\nbest established truths, endeavoring to envelope the mind in darkness\r\nthe concomitant of slavery, and to lock the strong chains of domestic\r\ndespotism on a country, which by the most glorious and successful\r\nstruggles is but newly emancipated from the spectre of foreign\r\ndominion.—— [5] But there are certain seasons in the course of human\r\naffairs, when Genius, Virtue, and Patriotism, seems to nod over the\r\nvices of the times, and perhaps never more remarkably, than at the\r\npresent period; or we should not see such a passive disposition prevail\r\nin some, who we must candidly suppose, have liberal and enlarged\r\nsentiments; while a supple multitude are paying a blind and idolatrous\r\nhomage to the opinions of those who by the most precipitate steps are\r\ntreading down their dear bought privileges; and who are endeavouring\r\nby all the arts of insinuation, and influence, to betray the people\r\nof the United States, into an acceptance of a most complicated system\r\nof government; marked on the one side with the _dark_, _secret_ and\r\n_profound intrigues_, of the statesman, long practised in the purlieus\r\nof despotism; and on the other, with the ideal projects of _young\r\nambition_, with its wings just expanded to soar to a summit, which\r\nimagination has painted in such gawdy colours as to intoxicate the\r\n_inexperienced votary_, and to send _him_ rambling from State to State,\r\nto collect materials to construct the ladder of preferment.\r\n\r\nBut as a variety of objections to the _heterogeneous phantom_, have\r\nbeen repeatedly laid before the public, by men of the best abilities\r\nand intentions; I will not expatiate long on a Republican _form_ of\r\ngovernment, founded on the principles of monarchy—a democratick branch\r\nwith the _features_ of aristocracy—and the extravagance of nobility\r\npervading the minds of many of the candidates for office, with the\r\npoverty of peasantry hanging heavily on them, and insurmountable, from\r\ntheir taste for expence, unless a general provision should be made\r\nin the arrangement of the civil list, which may enable them with the\r\nchampions of their cause to “_sail down the new pactolean channel_.”\r\nSome gentlemen, with laboured zeal, have spent much time in urging the\r\nnecessity of government, from the embarrassments of trade—the want\r\nof respectability abroad and confidence of the public engagements at\r\nhome:—These are obvious truths which no one denies; and there are few\r\nwho do not unite in the general wish for the restoration of public\r\nfaith, the revival of commerce, arts, agriculture, and industry,\r\nunder a lenient, peaceable and energetick government: But the most\r\nsagacious advocates for the party have not by fair discusion; and\r\nrational argumentation, evinced the necessity of adopting this many\r\nheaded monster; of such motley mixture, that its enemies cannot trace a\r\nfeature of Democratick or Republican [6] extract; nor have its friends\r\nthe courage to denominate a Monarchy, an Aristocracy, or an Oligarchy,\r\nand the favoured bantling must have passed through the short period of\r\nits existence without a name, had not Mr. _Wilson_, in the fertility of\r\nhis genius, suggested the happy epithet of a _Federal Republic_.—But\r\nI leave the field of general censure on the secresy of its birth, the\r\nrapidity of its growth, and the fatal consequences of suffering it\r\nto live to the age of maturity, and will particularize some of the\r\nmost weighty objections to its passing through this continent in a\r\ngigantic size.—It will be allowed by every one that the fundamental\r\nprinciple of a free government is the equal representation of a free\r\npeople——And I will _first_ observe with a justly celebrated writer,\r\n“That the principal aim of society is to protect individuals in the\r\nabsolute rights which were vested in them by the immediate laws of\r\nnature, but which could not be preserved in peace, without the mutual\r\nintercourse which is gained by the institution of friendly and social\r\ncommunities.” And when society has thus deputed a certain number of\r\ntheir equals to take care of their personal rights, and the interest\r\nof the whole community, it must be considered that responsibility is\r\nthe great security of integrity and honour; and that annual election\r\nis the basis of responsibility,—Man is not immediately corrupted, but\r\npower without limitation, or amenability, may endanger the brightest\r\nvirtue—whereas a frequent return to the bar of their Constituents is\r\nthe strongest check against the corruptions to which men are liable,\r\neither from the intrigues of others of more subtle genius, or the\r\npropensities of their own hearts,—and the gentlemen who have so warmly\r\nadvocated in the late Convention of the Massachusetts, the change from\r\nannual to biennial elections; may have been in the same predicament,\r\nand perhaps with the same views that Mr. _Hutchinson_ once acknowledged\r\nhimself, when in a letter to _Lord Hillsborough_, he observed, “that\r\nthe grand difficulty of making a change in government against the\r\ngeneral bent of the people had caused him to turn his thoughts to a\r\nvariety of plans, in order to find one that might be executed in spite\r\nof opposition,” and the first he proposed was that, “instead of annual,\r\nthe elections should be only once in three years:” but the Minister\r\nhad not the hardiness to attempt such an innovation, even in the\r\nrevision of colonial charters: nor has any one ever defended Biennial,\r\nTriennial or Septennial Elections, either in the [7] British House of\r\nCommons, or in the debates of Provincial assemblies, on general and\r\nfree principles: but it is unnecessary to dwell long on this article,\r\nas the best political writers have supported the principles of annual\r\nelections with a precision, that cannot be confuted, though they may be\r\ndarkned, by the sophistical arguments that have been thrown out with\r\ndesign, to undermine all the barriers of freedom.\r\n\r\n2. There is no security in the profered system, either for the rights\r\nof conscience or the liberty of the Press: Despotism usually while\r\nit is gaining ground, will suffer men to think, say, or write what\r\nthey please; but when once established, if it is thought necessary to\r\nsubserve the purposes, of arbitrary power, the most unjust restrictions\r\nmay take place in the first instance, and an _imprimator_ on the Press\r\nin the next, may silence the complaints, and forbid the most decent\r\nremonstrances of an injured and oppressed people.\r\n\r\n3. There are no well defined limits of the Judiciary Powers, they seem\r\nto be left as a boundless ocean, that has broken over the chart of\r\nthe Supreme Lawgiver, “_thus far shalt thou go and no further_,” and\r\nas they cannot be comprehended by the clearest capacity, or the most\r\nsagacious mind, it would be an Herculean labour to attempt to describe\r\nthe dangers with which they are replete.\r\n\r\n4. The Executive and the Legislative are so dangerously blended as to\r\ngive just cause of alarm, and everything relative thereto, is couched\r\nin such ambiguous terms—in such vague and indefinite expression, as\r\nis a sufficient ground without any objection, for the reprobation of a\r\nsystem, that the authors dare not hazard to a clear investigation.\r\n\r\n5. The abolition of trial by jury in civil causes.—This mode of\r\ntrial the learned Judge Blackstone observes, “has been coeval with the\r\nfirst rudiments of civil government, that property, liberty and life,\r\ndepend on maintaining in its legal force the constitutional trial by\r\njury.” He bids his readers pauze, and with Sir Matthew Hale observes,\r\nhow admirably this mode is adapted to the investigation of truth\r\nbeyond any other the world can produce. Even the party who have been\r\ndisposed to swallow, without examination, the proposals of the _secret\r\nconclave_, have started on a discovery that this essential right was\r\ncurtailed; and shall a privilege, the origin of which may be traced to\r\nour Saxon ancestors—that has been a part of the law of nations, even\r\nin the fewdatory systems of France, [8] Germany and Italy—and from the\r\nearliest records has been held so sacred, both in ancient and modern\r\nBritain, that it could never be shaken by the introduction of Norman\r\ncustoms, or any other conquests or change of government——shall this\r\ninestimable privilege be relinquished in America—either thro’ the fear\r\nof inquisition for unaccounted thousands of public monies in the hands\r\nof some who have been officious in the fabrication of the _consolidated\r\nsystem_, or from the apprehension that some future delinquent possessed\r\nof more power than integrity, may be called to a trial by his peers in\r\nthe hour of investigation.\r\n\r\n6. Though it has been said by Mr. _Wilson_ and many others, that a\r\nStanding-Army is necessary for the dignity and safety of America, yet\r\nfreedom revolts at the idea, when the Divan, or the Despot, may draw\r\nout his dragoons to suppress the murmurs of a few, who may yet cherish\r\nthose sublime principles which call forth the exertions, and lead to\r\nthe best improvements of the human mind. It is hoped this country\r\nmay yet be governed by milder methods than are usually displayed\r\nbeneath the bannerets of military law.—Standing armies have been the\r\nnursery of vice and the bane of liberty from the Roman legions to the\r\nestablishment of the artful Ximenes, and from the ruin of the Cortes\r\nof Spain, to the planting of the British cohorts in the capitals of\r\nAmerica:—By the edicts of an authority vested in the sovereign power\r\nby the proposed constitution, the militia of the country, the bulwark\r\nof defence, and the security of national liberty if no longer under\r\nthe controul of civil authority; but at the rescript of the Monarch,\r\nor the aristocracy, they may either be employed to extort the enormous\r\nsums that will be necessary to support the civil list—to maintain\r\nthe regalia of power—and the splendour of the most useless part of\r\nthe community, or they may be sent into foreign countries for the\r\nfulfilment of treaties, stipulated by the President and two-thirds of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n7. Notwithstanding the delusory promise to guarantee a Republican form\r\nof government to every State in the Union—If the most discerning\r\neye could discover any meaning at all in the engagement, there are\r\nno resources left for the support of internal government, or the\r\nliquidation of the debts of the State. Every source of revenue is in\r\nthe monopoly of Congress, and if the several legislatures in their\r\nenfeebled state, should against their own feelings be necessitated to\r\nattempt a dry tax [9] for the payment of their debts, and the support\r\nof internal police, even this may be required for the purposes of the\r\ngeneral government.\r\n\r\n8. As the new Congress are empowered to determine their own salaries,\r\nthe requisitions for this purpose may not be very moderate, and the\r\ndrain for public moneys will probably rise past all calculation: and\r\nit is to be feared when America has consolidated its despotism, the\r\nworld will witness the truth of the assertion—“that the pomp of an\r\nEastern monarch may impose on the vulgar who may estimate the force of\r\na nation by the magnificence of its palaces; but the wise man judges\r\ndifferently, it is by that very magnificence he estimates its weakness.\r\nHe sees nothing more in the midst of this imposing pomp, where the\r\ntyrant sets enthroned, than a sumptuous and mournful decoration of the\r\ndead; the apparatus of a fastuous funeral, in the centre of which is a\r\ncold and lifeless lump of unanimated earth, a phantom of power ready to\r\ndisappear before the enemy, by whom it is despised!”\r\n\r\n9. There is no provision for a rotation, nor anything to prevent the\r\nperpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little\r\nwell timed bribery, will probably be done, to the exclusion of men of\r\nthe best abilities from their share in the offices of government.—By\r\nthis neglect we lose the advantages of that check to the overbearing\r\ninsolence of office, which by rendering him ineligible at certain\r\nperiods, keeps the mind of man in equilibrio, and teaches him the\r\nfeelings of the governed, and better qualifies him to govern in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n10. The inhabitants of the United States, are liable to be dragged from\r\nthe vicinity of their own country, or state, to answer the litigious\r\nor unjust suit of an adversary, on the most distant borders of the\r\nContinent: in short the appelate jurisdiction of the Supreme Federal\r\nCourt, includes an unwarrantable stretch of power over the liberty,\r\nlife, and property of the subject, through the wide Continent of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n11. One Representative to thirty thousand inhabitants is a very\r\ninadequate representation; and every man who is not lost to all sense\r\nof freedom to his country, must reprobate the idea of Congress altering\r\nby law, or on any pretence whatever, interfering with any regulations\r\nfor time, places, and manner of choosing our own Representatives.\r\n\r\n12. If the sovereignty of America is designed to be elective, the\r\ncircumscribing the votes to only ten electors in this State, [10] and\r\nthe same proportion in all the others, is nearly tantamount to the\r\nexclusion of the voice of the people in the choice of their first\r\nmagistrate. It is vesting the choice solely in an aristocratic junto,\r\nwho may easily combine in each State to place at the head of the Union\r\nthe most convenient instrument for despotic sway.\r\n\r\n13. A Senate chosen for six years will, in most instances, be an\r\nappointment for life, as the influence of such a body over the minds\r\nof the people will be coequal to the extensive powers with which they\r\nare vested, and they will not only forget, but be forgotten by their\r\nconstituents—a branch of the Supreme Legislature thus set beyond\r\nall responsibility is totally repugnant to every principle of a free\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n14. There is no provision by a bill of rights to guard against the\r\ndangerous encroachments of power in too many instances to be named: but\r\nI cannot pass over in silence the insecurity in which we are left with\r\nregard to warrants unsupported by evidence—the daring experiment of\r\ngranting _writs of assistance_ in a former arbitrary administration\r\nis not yet forgotten in the Massachusetts; nor can we be so ungrateful\r\nto the memory of the patriots who counteracted their operation, as so\r\nsoon after their manly exertions to save us from such a detestable\r\ninstrument of arbitrary power, to subject ourselves to the insolence\r\nof any petty revenue officer to enter our houses, search, insult, and\r\nseize at pleasure. We are told by a gentleman of too much virtue and\r\nreal probity to suspect he has a design to deceive—“that the whole\r\nconstitution is a declaration of rights,”—but mankind must think for\r\nthemselves, and to many very judicious and discerning characters, the\r\nwhole constitution with very few exceptions appears a perversion of\r\nthe rights of particular states, and of private citizens.——But the\r\ngentleman goes on to tell us, “that the primary object is the general\r\ngovernment, and that the rights of individuals are only incidentally\r\nmentioned, and that there was a clear impropriety in being very\r\nparticular about them.” But, asking pardon for dissenting from such\r\nrespectable authority, who has been led into several mistakes, more\r\nfrom his predilection in favour of certain modes of government, than\r\nfrom a want of understanding or veracity. The rights of individuals\r\nought to be the primary object of all government, and cannot be too\r\nsecurely guarded by the most explicit declarations in their favor.\r\nThis has been the opinion of the Hampdens, the Pyms, and [11] many\r\nother illustrious names, that have stood forth in defence of English\r\nliberties; and even the Italian master in politicks, the subtle and\r\nrenowned Machiavel acknowledges, that no republic ever yet stood on a\r\nstable foundation without satisfying the common people.\r\n\r\n15. The difficulty, if not impracticability, of exercising the equal\r\nand equitable powers of government by a single legislature over an\r\nextent of territory that reaches from the Mississippi to the Western\r\nlakes, and from them to the Atlantic Ocean, is an insuperable objection\r\nto the adoption of the new system.—Mr. _Hutchinson_, the great\r\nchampion for arbitrary power, in the multitude of his machinations to\r\nsubvert the liberties in this country, was obliged to acknowledge in\r\none of his letters, that, “from the extent of country from north to\r\nsouth, the scheme of one government was impracticable.” But if the\r\nauthors of the present visionary project, can by the arts of deception,\r\nprecipitation and address, obtain a majority of suffrages in the\r\nconventions of the states to try the hazardous experiment, they may\r\nthen make the same inglorious boast with this insidious politician, who\r\nmay perhaps be their model, that “the union of the colonies was pretty\r\nwell broken, “and that he hoped to never see it renewed.”\r\n\r\n16. It is an undisputed fact that not one legislature in the United\r\nStates had the most distant idea when they first appointed members for\r\na convention, entirely commercial, or when they afterwards authorized\r\nthem to consider on some amendments of the Federal union, that they\r\nwould without any warrant from their constituents, presume on so bold\r\nand daring a stride, as ultimately to destroy the state governments,\r\nand offer a _consolidated system_, irreversible but on conditions that\r\nthe smallest degree of penetration must discover to be impracticable.\r\n\r\n17. The first appearance of the article which declares the ratification\r\nof nine states sufficient for the establishment of the new system,\r\nwears the face of dissension, is a subversion of the union of\r\nConfederated States, and tends to the introduction of anarchy and civil\r\nconvulsions, and may be a means of involving the whole country in blood.\r\n\r\n18. The mode in which this constitution is recommended to the people to\r\njudge without either the advice of Congress, or the legislatures of the\r\nseveral states is very reprehensible—it is an attempt to force it upon\r\nthem before it could be thoroughly [12] understood, and may leave us in\r\nthat situation, that in the first moments of slavery in the minds of\r\nthe people agitated by the remembrance of their lost liberties, will be\r\nlike the sea in a tempest, that sweeps down every mound of security.\r\n\r\nBut it is needless to enumerate other instances, in which the proposed\r\nconstitution appears contradictory to the first principles which ought\r\nto govern mankind; and it is equally so to enquire into the motives\r\nthat induced to so bold a step as the annihilation of the independence\r\nand sovereignty of the thirteen distinct states.——They are but\r\ntoo obvious through the whole progress of the business, from the\r\nfirst shutting up the doors of the federal convention and resolving\r\nthat no member should correspond with gentlemen in the different\r\nstates on the subject under discussion; till the trivial proposition\r\nof _recommending_ a few amendments was artfully ushered into the\r\nconvention of the Massachusetts. The questions that were then before\r\nthat honorable assembly were profound and important, they were of such\r\nmagnitude and extent, that the consequences may run parallel with the\r\nexistence of the country; and to see them waved and hastily terminated\r\nby a measure too absurd to require a serious refutation, raises the\r\nhonest indignation of every true lover of his country. Nor are they\r\nless grieved that the ill policy and arbitrary disposition of some of\r\nthe sons of America has thus precipitated to the contemplation and\r\ndiscussion of questions that no one could rationally suppose would\r\nhave been agitated among us, till time had blotted out the principles\r\non which the late revolution was grounded; or till the last traits of\r\nthe many political tracts, which defended the separation from Britain,\r\nand the rights of men were consigned to everlasting oblivion. After\r\nthe severe conflicts this country has suffered, it is presumed that\r\nthey are disposed to make every reasonable sacrifice before the altar\r\nof peace.——But when we contemplate the nature of men and consider\r\nthem originally on an equal footing, subject to the same feelings,\r\nstimulated by the same passions, and recollecting the struggles\r\nthey have recently made, for the security of their civil rights; it\r\ncannot be expected that the inhabitants of the Massachusetts, can be\r\neasily lulled into a fatal security, by the declamatory effusions of\r\ngentlemen, who, contrary to the experience of all ages would persuade\r\nthem there is no danger to be apprehended, from vesting discretionary\r\npowers in the hands of man, which he may, or may not abuse. The very\r\nsuggestion, that [13] we ought to trust to the precarious hope of\r\namendments and redress, after we have voluntarily fixed the shackles on\r\nour own necks should have awakened to a double degree of caution.—This\r\npeople have not forgotten the artful insinuations of a former\r\nGovernor, when pleading the unlimited authority of parliament before\r\nthe legislature of the Massachusetts; nor that his arguments were very\r\nsimilar to some lately urged by gentlemen who boast of opposing his\r\nmeasures, “_with halters about their necks_.”\r\n\r\nWe were then told by him, in all the soft language of insinuation,\r\nthat no form of government, of human construction can be perfect—that\r\nwe had nothing to fear—that we had no reason to complain—that we\r\nhad only to acquiesce in their illegal claims, and to submit to\r\nthe requisition of parliament, and doubtless the lenient hand of\r\ngovernment would redress all grievances, and remove the oppressions\r\nof the people:—Yet we soon saw armies of mercenaries encamped on\r\nour plains—our commerce ruined—our harbours blockaded—and our\r\ncities burnt. It may be replied that this was in consequence of an\r\nobstinate defence of our privileges; this may be true; and when the\r\n“_ultima ratio_” is called to aid, the weakest must fall. But let the\r\nbest informed historian produce an instance when bodies of men were\r\nentrusted with power, and the proper checks relinquished, if they were\r\never found destitute of ingenuity sufficient to furnish pretences\r\nto abuse it. And the people at large are already sensible, that the\r\nliberties which America has claimed, which reason has justified, and\r\nwhich have been so gloriously defended by the swords of the brave; are\r\nnot about to fall before the tyranny of foreign conquest: it is native\r\nusurpation that is shaking the foundations of peace, and spreading\r\nthe sable curtain of despotism over the United States. The banners of\r\nfreedom were erected in the wilds of America by our ancestors, while\r\nthe wolf prowled for his prey on the one hand, and more savage man\r\non the other; they have been since rescued from the invading hand of\r\nforeign power, by the valor and blood of their posterity; and there\r\nwas reason to hope they would continue for ages to illumine a quarter\r\nof the globe, by nature kindly separated from the proud monarchies of\r\nEurope, and the infernal darkness of Asiatic slavery.—And it is to\r\nbe feared we shall soon see this country rushing into the extremes of\r\nconfusion and violence, in consequence of the proceeding of a set of\r\ngentlemen, who disregarding [14] the purposes of their appointment,\r\nhave assumed powers unauthorized by any commission, have unnecessarily\r\nrejected the confederation of the United States, and annihilated the\r\nsovereignty and independence of the individual governments.—The causes\r\nwhich have inspired a few men to assemble for very different purposes\r\nwith such a degree of temerity as to break with a single stroke the\r\nunion of America, and disseminate the seeds of discord through the land\r\nmay be easily investigated, when we survey the partizans of monarchy in\r\nthe state conventions, urging the adoption of a mode of government that\r\nmilitates with the former professions and exertions of this country,\r\nand with all ideas of republicanism, and the equal rights of men.\r\n\r\nPassion, prejudice, and error, are characteristics of human nature;\r\nand as it cannot be accounted for on any principles of philosophy,\r\nreligion, or good policy; to these shades in the human character\r\nmust be attributed the mad zeal of some, to precipitate to a blind\r\nadoption of the measures of the late federal convention, without giving\r\nopportunity for better information to those who are misled by influence\r\nor ignorance into erroneous opinions.——Litterary talents may be\r\nprostituted, and the powers of genius debased to subserve the purposes\r\nof ambition or avarice; but the feelings of the heart will dictate the\r\nlanguage of truth, and the simplicity of her accents will proclaim\r\nthe infamy of those, who betray the rights of the people, under the\r\nspecious, and popular pretence of _justice_, _consolidation_, and\r\n_dignity_.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed the great body of the people unite in sentiment with\r\nthe writer of these observations, who most devoutly prays that public\r\ncredit may rear her declining head, and remunerative justice pervade\r\nthe land; nor is there a doubt if a free government is continued, that\r\ntime and industry will enable both the public and private debtor to\r\nliquidate their arrearages in the most equitable manner. They wish to\r\nsee the Confederated States bound together by the most indissoluble\r\nunion, but without renouncing their separate sovereignties and\r\nindependence, and becoming tributaries to a consolidated fabrick of\r\naristocratick tyranny.——They wish to see government established,\r\nand peaceably holding the reins with honour, energy, and dignity;\r\nbut they wish for no _federal city_ whose “_cloud cap’t towers_”\r\nmay screen the state culprit from the hand of justice; while its\r\nexclusive jurisdiction may [15] protect the riot of armies encamped\r\nwithin its limits.—They deprecate discord and civil convulsions, but\r\nthey are not yet generally prepared with the ungrateful Israelites\r\nto ask a King, nor are their spirits sufficiently broken to yield\r\nthe best of their olive grounds to his servants, and to see their\r\nsons appointed to run before his chariots.—It has been observed by\r\na zealous advocate for the new system, that most governments are the\r\nresult of fraud or violence, and this with design to recommend its\r\nacceptance—but has not almost every step towards its fabrication\r\nbeen fraudulent in the extreme? Did not the prohibition strictly\r\nenjoined by the general Convention, that no member should make any\r\ncommunication to his Constituents, or to gentlemen of consideration\r\nand abilities in the other States, bear evident marks of fraudulent\r\ndesigns?—This circumstance is regretted in strong terms by Mr.\r\nMartin, a member from Maryland, who acknowledges “He had no idea that\r\nall the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of the States was contained\r\nin that Convention, and that he wished to have corresponded with\r\ngentlemen of eminent political characters abroad, and to give their\r\nsentiments due weight”—he adds, “so extremely solicitous were they,\r\nthat their proceedings should not transpire, that the members were\r\nprohibited from taking copies of their resolutions, or extracts\r\nfrom the Journals, without express permission, by vote.”——And the\r\nhurry with which it has been urged to the acceptance of the people,\r\nwithout giving time, by adjournments, for better information, and\r\nmore unanimity has a deceptive appearance; and if finally driven to\r\nresistance, as the only alternative between that and servitude, till in\r\nthe confusion of discord, the reins should be seized by the violence\r\nof some enterprizing genius, that may sweep down the last barrier of\r\nliberty, it must be added to the score of criminality with which the\r\nfraudulent usurpation at Philadelphia, may be chargeable.——Heaven\r\navert such a tremendous scence! and let us still hope a more happy\r\ntermination of the present ferment:—may the people be calm and wait\r\na legal redress; may the mad transport of some of our infatuated\r\ncapitals subside; and every influential character through the States,\r\nmake the most prudent exertions for a new general Convention, who\r\nmay vest adequate powers in Congress, for all national purposes,\r\nwithout annihilating the individual governments, and drawing blood\r\nfrom every pore by taxes, impositions and illegal restrictions.—This\r\nstep might [16] again re-establish the Union, restore tranquility\r\nto the ruffled mind of the inhabitants, and save America from the\r\ndistresses, dreadful even in contemplation.——“The great art of\r\ngoverning is to lay aside all prejudices and attachments to particular\r\nopinions, classes or individual characters to consult the spirit of\r\nthe people; to give way to it; and in so doing, to give it a turn\r\ncapable of inspiring those sentiments, which may induce them to relish\r\na change, which an alteration of circumstances may hereafter make\r\nnecessary.”——The education of the advocates for monarchy should have\r\ntaught them, and their memory should have suggested that “monarchy\r\nis a species of government fit only for a people too much corrupted\r\nby luxury, avarice, and a passion for pleasure, to have any love for\r\ntheir country, and whose vices the fear of punishment alone is able to\r\nrestrain; but by no means calculated for a nation that is poor, and\r\nat the same time tenacious of their liberty—animated with a disgust\r\nto tyranny—and inspired with the generous feeling of patriotism and\r\nliberty, and at the same time, like the ancient Spartans have been\r\nhardened by temperance and manly exertions, and equally despising\r\nthe fatigues of the field, and the fear of enemies,”——and while\r\nthey change their ground they should recollect, that Aristocracy is\r\na still more formidable foe to public virtue, and the prosperity\r\nof a nation—that under such a government her patriots become\r\nmercenaries—her soldiers cowards, and the people slaves.——Though\r\nseveral State Conventions have assented to, and ratified, yet the voice\r\nof the people appears at present strong against the adoption of the\r\nConstitution.——By the chicanery, intrigue, and false colouring of\r\nthose who plume themselves, more on their education and abilities,\r\nthan their political, patriotic, or private virtues—by the imbecility\r\nof some, and the duplicity of others, a majority of the Convention of\r\nMassachusetts have been flattered with the ideas of amendments, when it\r\nwill be too late to complain——While several very worthy characters,\r\ntoo timid for their situation, magnified the hopeless alternative,\r\nbetween the dissolution of the bands of all government, and receiving\r\nthe proffered system _in toto_, after long endeavouring to reconcile\r\nit to their consciences, swallowed the indigestible panacea, and in a\r\nkind of sudden desperation lent their signature to the dereliction of\r\nthe honourable station they held in the Union, and have broken over the\r\nsolemn compact, by which they were bound to support their own excellent\r\nconstitution till the period [17] of revision. Yet Virginia, equally\r\nlarge and respectable, and who have done honour to themselves, by\r\ntheir vigorous exertions from the first dawn of independence, have not\r\nyet acted upon the question; they have wisely taken time to consider\r\nbefore they introduce innovations of a most dangerous nature:——her\r\ninhabitants are brave, her burgesses are free, and they have a Governor\r\nwho dares to think for himself, and to speak his opinion (without first\r\npouring libations on the altar of popularity) though it should militate\r\nwith some of the most accomplished and illustrious characters.\r\n\r\nMaryland, who has no local interest to lead her to adopt, will\r\ndoubtless reject the system——I hope the same characters still\r\nlive, and that the same spirit which dictated to them a wise and\r\ncautious care, against sudden revolutions in government, and made\r\nthem the last State that acceded to the independence of America, will\r\nlead them to support what they so deliberately claimed.——Georgia\r\napprehensive of a war with the Savages, has acceded in order to insure\r\nprotection.——Pennsylvania has struggled through much in the same\r\nmanner, as the Massachusetts, against the manly feelings, and the\r\nmasterly reasonings of a very respectable part of the Convention:\r\nThey have adopted the system, and seen some of its authors burnt in\r\neffigy—their towns thrown into riot and confusion, and the minds of\r\nthe people agitated by apprehension and discord.\r\n\r\nNew-Jersey and Delaware have united in the measure, from the locality\r\nof their situation, and the selfish motives which too generally govern\r\nmankind; the Federal City, and the seat of government, will naturally\r\nattract the intercourse of strangers—the youth of enterprise, and the\r\nwealth of the nation to the central States.\r\n\r\nConnecticut has pushed it through with the precipitation of her\r\nneighbour, with few dissentient voices;—but more from irritation and\r\nresentment to a sister State, perhaps partiality to herself in her\r\ncommercial regulations, than from a comprehensive view of the system,\r\nas a regard to the welfare of all.——But New York has motives, that\r\nwill undoubtedly lead her to rejection, without being afraid to appeal\r\nto the understanding of mankind, to justify the grounds of their\r\nrefusal to adopt a Constitution, that even the framers dare not to\r\nrisque to the hazard of revision, amendment, or reconsideration, least\r\nthe whole superstructure should be demolished by more skilful and\r\ndiscreet architects.——I know not what part the Carolinas [18] will\r\ntake; but I hope their determinations will comport with the dignity and\r\nfreedom of this country—their decisions will have great weight in the\r\nscale.——But equally important are the small States of New Hampshire\r\nand Rhode Island:—New York, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and\r\nthese two lesser States may yet support the liberties of the Continent;\r\nif they refuse a ratification, or postpone their proceedings till the\r\nspirits of the community have time to cool, there is little doubt but\r\nthe wise measure of another federal convention will be adopted, when\r\nthe members would have the advantage of viewing, at large, through\r\nthe medium of truth, the objections that have been made from various\r\nquarters; such a measure might be attended with the most salutary\r\neffects, and prevent the dread consequences of civil feuds.——But\r\neven if some of those large states should hastily accede, yet we have\r\nfrequently seen in the story of revolution, relief spring from a\r\nquarter least expected.\r\n\r\nThough the virtues of a Cato could not save Rome, nor the abilities of\r\na Padilla defend the citizens of Castile from falling under the yoke\r\nof Charles; yet a _Tell_ once suddenly rose from a little obscure\r\ncity, and boldly rescued the liberties of his country.——Every age\r\nhas its Bruti and its Decci, as well as its Cæsars and Sejani:—The\r\nhappiness of mankind depends much on the modes of government, and the\r\nvirtues of the governors; and America may yet produce characters who\r\nhave genius and capacity sufficient to form the manners and correct\r\nthe morals of the people, and virtue enough to lead their country to\r\nfreedom. Since their dismemberment from the British empire, America\r\nhas, in many instances, resembled the conduct of a restless, vigorous,\r\nluxurious youth, prematurely emancipated from the authority of a\r\nparent, but without the experience necessary to direct him to act\r\nwith dignity or discretion. Thus we have seen her break the shackles\r\nof foreign dominion, and all the blessings of peace restored on the\r\nmost honourable terms: She acquired the liberty of framing her own\r\nlaws, choosing her own magistrates, and adopting manners and modes of\r\ngovernment the most favourable to the freedom and happiness of society.\r\nBut how little have we availed ourselves of these superior advantages:\r\nThe glorious fabric of liberty successfully reared with so much labor\r\nand assiduity totters to the foundation, and may be blown away as\r\nthe bubble of fancy by the rude breath of military combinations, and\r\npoliticians of yesterday.\r\n\r\n[19] It is true this country lately armed in opposition to regal\r\ndespotism—impoverished by the expenses of a long war, and unable\r\nimmediately to fulfil their public or private engagements that appeared\r\nin some instances, with a boldness of spirit that seemed to set at\r\ndefiance all authority, government, or order, on the one hand; while\r\non the other, there has been, not only a secret wish, but an open\r\navowal of the necessity of drawing the reins of government much too\r\ntaught, not only for a republicanism, but for a wise and limited\r\nmonarchy.——But the character of this people is not averse to a degree\r\nof subordination, the truth of this appears from the easy restoration\r\nof tranquility, after a dangerous insurrection in one of the states;\r\nthis also evinces a little necessity of a complete revolution of\r\ngovernment throughout the union. But it is a republican principle\r\nthat the majority should rule; and if a spirit of moderation should\r\nbe cultivated on both sides, till the voice of the people at large\r\ncould be fairly heard it should be held sacred.—And if, on such a\r\nscrutiny, the proposed constitution should appear repugnant to their\r\ncharacter and wishes; if they, in the language of a late elegant pen,\r\nshould acknowledge that “no confusion in my mind, is more terrible\r\nto them than the stern disciplined regularity and vaunted police of\r\narbitrary governments, where every heart is depraved by fear, where\r\nmankind dare not assume their natural characters, where the free spirit\r\nmust crouch to the slave in office, where genius must repress her\r\neffusions, or like the Egyptian worshippers, offer them in sacrifice\r\nto the calves in power, and where the human mind, always in shackles,\r\nshrinks from every generous effort.” Who would then have the effrontery\r\nto say, it ought not to be thrown out with indignation, however some\r\nrespectable names have appeared to support it.——But if after all, on\r\na dispassionate and fair discussion, the people generally give their\r\nvoices for a voluntary dereliction of their privileges, let every\r\nindividual who chooses the active scenes of life strive to support the\r\npeace and unanimity of his country, though every other blessing may\r\nexpire—And while the statesman is plodding for power, and the courtier\r\npractising the arts of dissimulation without check—while the rapacious\r\nare growing rich by oppression, and fortune throwing her gifts into\r\nthe lap of fools, let the sublimer characters, the philosophic lovers\r\nof freedom who have wept over her exit, retire to the calm shades of\r\ncontemplation, there they may look down with pity on the inconsistency\r\nof human nature, the revolutions of states, the rise of kingdoms, and\r\nthe fall of empires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn / Examination / into the / leading principles / of the /\r\nFederal Constitution / proposed by the late / Convention / held at\r\nPhiladelphia. / With / Answers to the principal objections / that have\r\nbeen raised against the system. / By a Citizen of America. /—Ut patria\r\nsua felicitate cæteris præstaret, efficit. / Xenoph.

Legislators have ever been deemed the greatest benefactors\r\nof mankind—respected when living, and often deified after their death.\r\nHence the fame of Fohi and Confucius—of Moses, Solon and Lycurgus—of\r\nRomulus and Numa—of Alfred, Peter the Great, and Mango Capac; whose\r\nnames will be celebrated through all ages, for framing and improving\r\nconstitutions of government, which introduced order into society and\r\nsecured the benefits of law to millions of the human race.\r\n\r\nThis western world now beholds an æra important beyond conception,\r\nand which posterity will number with the age of Czar of Muscovy, and\r\nwith the promulgation of the Jewish laws at Mount Sinai. The names\r\nof those men who have digested a system of constitutions for the\r\nAmerican empire, will be enrolled with those of Zamolxis and Odin, and\r\ncelebrated by posterity with the honors which less enlightened nations\r\nhave paid to the fabled demi-gods of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[6] But the origin of the AMERICAN REPUBLIC is distinguished by\r\npeculiar circumstances. Other nations have been driven together by\r\nfear and necessity—the governments have generally been the result of\r\na single man’s observations; or the offspring of particular interests.\r\nIn the formation of our constitution, the wisdom of all ages is\r\ncollected—the legislators of antiquity are consulted—as well as the\r\nopinions and interests of the millions who are concerned. In short, it\r\nis _an empire of reason_.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of such a government, it is not only the _right_, but\r\nthe indispensable _duty_ of every citizen to examine the principles of\r\nit, to compare them with the principles of other governments, with a\r\nconstant eye to our particular situation and circumstances, and thus\r\nendeavor to foresee the future operations of our own system, and its\r\neffects upon human happiness.\r\n\r\nConvinced of this truth, I have no apology to offer for the following\r\nremarks, but an earnest desire to be useful to my country.\r\n\r\nIn attending to the proposed Federal Constitution, the first thing\r\nthat presents itself to our consideration, is the division of the\r\nlegislative into two branches. This article has so many advocates\r\nin America, that it needs not any vindication.(3)—But it has its\r\nopposers, among whom are some respectable characters, especially in\r\nPennsylvania; for which reason, I will state [7] some of the arguments\r\nand facts which incline me to favor the proposed division.\r\n\r\nOn the first view of men in society, we should suppose that no man\r\nwould be bound by a law to which he had not given his consent. Such\r\nwould be our first idea of political obligation. But experience, from\r\ntime immemorial, has proved it to be impossible to unite the opinions\r\nof all the members of a community, in every case; and hence the\r\ndoctrine, that the opinions of a _majority_ must give law to the _whole\r\nState_: a doctrine as universally received, as any intuitive truth.\r\n\r\nAnother idea that naturally presents itself to our minds, on a slight\r\nconsideration of the subject, is, that in a perfect government, all the\r\nmembers of a society should be present, and each give his suffrage in\r\nacts of legislation, by which he is to be bound. This is impracticable\r\nin large states; and even were it not, it is very questionable whether\r\nit would be the _best_ mode of legislation. It was however practised\r\nin the free states of antiquity; and was the cause of innumerable\r\nevils. To avoid these evils, the moderns have invented the doctrine of\r\n_representation_, which seems to be the perfection of human government.\r\n\r\nAnother idea, which is very natural, is, that to complete the mode\r\nof legislation, all the representatives should be collected into\r\n_one body_, for the purpose of debating questions and enacting laws.\r\nSpeculation would suggest the idea;\r\n\r\n[8] and the desire of improving upon the systems of government in the\r\nold world, would operate powerfully in its favor.\r\n\r\nBut men are ever running into extremes. The passions, after a violent\r\nconstraint, are apt to run into licentiousness; and even the reason of\r\nmen, who have experienced evils from the _defects_ of a government,\r\nwill sometimes coolly condemn the _whole system_.\r\n\r\nEvery person, moderately acquainted with human nature, knows that\r\npublic bodies, as well as individuals, are liable to the influence of\r\nsudden and violent passions, under the operation of which, the voice of\r\nreason is silenced. Instances of such influence are not so frequent,\r\nas in individuals; but its effects are extensive in proportion to the\r\nnumbers that compose the public body. This fact suggests the expediency\r\nof dividing the powers of legislation between the two bodies of men,\r\nwhose debates shall be separate and not dependent on each other;\r\nthat, if at any time, one part should appear to be under any undue\r\ninfluence, either from passion, obstinacy, jealousy of particular\r\nmen, attachment to a popular speaker, or other extraordinary causes,\r\nthere might be a power in the legislature sufficient to check every\r\npernicious measure. Even in a small republic, composed of men, equal\r\nin property and abilities, and all meeting for the purpose of making\r\nlaws, like the old Romans in the field of Mars, a division of the\r\nbody into two independent branches, would be a necessary step to\r\nprevent the disorders, which arise from [9] the pride, irritability\r\nand stubborness of mankind. This will ever be the case, while men\r\npossess passions, easily inflamed, which may bias their reason and lead\r\nthem to erroneous conclusions.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration has weight: A single body of men may be led\r\nastray by one person of abilities and address, who, on the first\r\nstarting a proposition, may throw a plausible appearance on one side of\r\nthe question, and give a lead to the whole debate. To prevent any ill\r\nconsequence from such a circumstance, a separate discussion, before a\r\ndifferent body of men, and taken up on new grounds, is a very eligible\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nBesides, the design of a senate is not merely to check the legislative\r\nassembly, but to collect wisdom and experience. In most of our\r\nconstitutions, and particularly in the proposed federal system, greater\r\nage and longer residence are required to qualify for the senate,\r\nthan for the house of representatives. This is a wise provision. The\r\nhouse of representatives may be composed of new and unexperienced\r\nmembers—strangers to the forms of proceeding, and the science of\r\nlegislation. But either positive institutions, or customs, which may\r\nsupply their place, fill the senate with men venerable for age and\r\nrespectability, experienced in the ways of men, and in the art of\r\ngoverning, and who are not liable to the bias of passions that govern\r\nthe young. If the senate of Rhode Island is an exception to this\r\nobservation, it is a proof that the mass of the people are corrupted,\r\nand that the senate should be elected [10] ess frequently than the\r\nother house: Had the old senate in Rhode Island held their seats for\r\nthree years; had they not been chosen, amidst a popular rage for paper\r\nmoney, the honor of that state would probably have been saved. The\r\nold senate would have stopped the measure for a year or two, till the\r\npeople could have had time to deliberate upon its consequences. I\r\nconsider it as a capital excellence of the proposed constitution, that\r\nthe senate can be wholly renewed but once in six years.\r\n\r\nExperience is the best instructor—it is better than a thousand\r\ntheories. The history of every government on earth affords proof of\r\nthe utility of different branches in a legislature. But I appeal\r\nonly to our own experience in America. To what cause can we ascribe\r\nthe absurd measures of Congress, in times past, and the speedy\r\nrecision of whole measures, but to the want of some check? I feel\r\nthe most profound deference for that honorable body, and perfect\r\nrespect for their opinions; but some of their steps betray a great\r\nwant of consideration—a defect, which perhaps nothing can remedy,\r\nbut a division of their deliberations. I will instance only their\r\n_resolution_ to build a _Federal Town_. When we were involved in a\r\ndebt, of which we could hardly pay the interest, and when Congress\r\ncould not command a shilling, the very proposition was extremely\r\nabsurd. Congress themselves became ashamed of the resolution, and\r\nrescinded it with as much silence as possible. Many other acts of that\r\nbody are equally reprehensible—but respect forbids me to mention them.\r\n\r\n[11] Several states, since the war, have experienced the necessity of a\r\ndivision of the legislature. Maryland was saved from a most pernicious\r\nmeasure, by her senate. A rage for paper money, bordering on madness,\r\nprevailed in their house of delegates—an emission of £.500,000 was\r\nproposed; a sum equal to the circulating medium of the State. Had the\r\nsum been emitted, every shilling of specie would have been driven from\r\ncirculation, and most of it from the state. Such a loss would not have\r\nbeen repaired in seven years—not to mention the whole catalogue of\r\nfrauds which would have followed the measure. The senate, like honest,\r\njudicious men, and the protectors of the interests of the state, firmly\r\nresisted the rage, and gave the people time to cool and to think. Their\r\nresistance was effectual—the people acquiesced, and the honor and\r\ninterest of the state were secured.\r\n\r\nThe house of representatives in Connecticut, soon after the war, had\r\ntaken offence at a certain act of Congress. The upper house, who\r\nunderstood the necessity and expediency of the measure, better than the\r\npeople, refused to concur in a remonstrance to Congress. Several other\r\ncircumstances gave umbrage to the lower house; and to weaken or destroy\r\nthe influence of the senate, the representatives, among other violent\r\nproceedings, resolved, not merely to remove the seat of government,\r\nbut to make every county town in the state the seat of government, by\r\nrotation. This foolish resolution would have disgraced school-boys—the\r\nsenate saved the honor of the state, by rejecting it with disdain— [12]\r\nand within two months, every representative was ashamed of the conduct\r\nof the house. All public bodies have these fits of passion, when their\r\nconduct seems to be perfectly boyish; and in these paroxisms, a check\r\nis highly necessary.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania exhibits many instances of this hasty conduct. At\r\none session of the legislature, an armed force is ordered, by a\r\nprecipitate resolution, to expel the settlers at Wioming from their\r\npossessions—at a succeeding session, the same people are confirmed\r\nin their possessions. At one session, a charter is wrested from a\r\ncorporation—at another, restored. The whole state is split into\r\nparties—everything is decided by party—any proposition from one side\r\nof the house, is sure to be damned by the other—and when one party\r\nperceives the other has the advantage, they play truant—and an officer\r\nor a mob hunt the absconding members in all the streets and alleys\r\nin town. Such farces have been repeated in Philadelphia—and _there\r\nalone_. Had the legislature been framed with some check upon rash\r\nproceedings, the honor of the state would have been saved—the party\r\nspirit would have died with the measures proposed in the legislature.\r\nBut now, any measure may be carried by party in the house; it then\r\nbecomes a law, and sows the seeds of dissension throughout the state.(4)\r\n\r\n[13] A thousand examples similar to the foregoing may be produced, both\r\nin ancient and modern history. Many plausible things may be said in\r\nfavor of pure democracy—many in favor of uniting the representatives\r\nof the people in one single house—but uniform experience proves both\r\nto be inconsistent with the peace of society, and the rights of freemen.\r\n\r\nThe state of Georgia has already discovered such inconveniences in its\r\nconstitution, that a proposition has been made for altering it; and\r\nthere is a prospect that a revisal will take place.\r\n\r\nPeople who have heard and read of the European governments, founded on\r\nthe different ranks of _monarch, nobility and people_, seem to view the\r\n_senate_ in America, where there is no difference of ranks and titles,\r\nas a useless branch—or as a servile imitation of foreign constitutions\r\nof government, without the same reasons. This is a capital mistake.\r\nOur senates, it is true, are not composed of a different order of\r\nmen; but the same reasons, the same necessity for distinct branches of\r\nthe legislature exists in all governments. But in most of our American\r\nconstitutions, we have all the advantages of checks and balance,\r\nwithout the danger which may arise [14] from a superior and independent\r\norder of men.\r\n\r\nIt is worth our while to institute a brief comparison between our\r\nAmerican forms of government, and the two _best constitutions_ that\r\never existed in Europe, the _Roman_ and the _British_.\r\n\r\nIn England, the king or supreme executive officer, is hereditary. In\r\nAmerica, the president of the United States, is elective. That this is\r\nan advantage will hardly be disputed.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Rome, the king was elective, and so were the consuls, who\r\nwere the executive officers in the republic. But they were elected\r\nby the body of the people, in their public assemblies; and this\r\ncircumstance paved the way for such excessive bribery and corruption\r\nas are wholly unknown in modern times. The president of the United\r\nStates is also elective; but by a few men—chosen by the several\r\nlegislatures—under their inspection—separated at a vast distance—and\r\nholding no office under the United States. Such a mode of election\r\nalmost precludes the possibility of corruption. Besides, no state\r\nhowever large, has the power of chusing a president in that state; for\r\neach elector must choose at least one man, who is not an inhabitant of\r\nthat State to which he belongs.\r\n\r\nThe crown of England is hereditary—the consuls of Rome were chosen\r\nannually—both these extremes are guarded against in our proposed\r\nconstitution. The president is not dis- [15] missed from his office, as\r\nsoon as he is acquainted with business—he continues four years, and is\r\nre-eligible, if the people approve his conduct. Nor can he canvass for\r\nhis office, by reason of the distance of the electors; and the pride\r\nand jealousy of the states will prevent his continuing too long in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe age requisite to qualify for this office is thirty-five\r\nyears.(5) The age requisite for admittance to the Roman consulship\r\nwas forty-three years. For this difference, good reasons may be\r\nassigned—the improvements in science, and particularly in government,\r\nrender it practicable for a man to qualify himself for an important\r\noffice, much earlier in life, than he could among the Romans;\r\nespecially in the early part of their commonwealth, when the office was\r\ninstituted. Besides it is very questionable whether any inconvenience\r\nwould have attended admission to the consulship at an earlier age.(6)\r\n\r\nThe powers vested in the president resemble the powers of the supreme\r\nmagistrates in Rome. They are not so extensive as those of the British\r\nking; but in one instance, the president, with concurrence of the\r\nsenate, has powers exceeding those of the Roman consuls; I mean in the\r\nappointment of judges and other subordinate executive officers. The\r\nprætors or judges in Rome were chosen annually by the people. This was\r\na defect in the Roman government. [16] One half the evils in a state\r\narise from a lax execution of the laws; and it is impossible that an\r\nexecutive officer can act with vigor and impartiality, when his office\r\ndepends on the popular voice. An annual popular election of executive\r\nofficers is the sure source of a negligent, partial and corrupt\r\nadministration. The independence of the judges in England has produced\r\na course of the most just, impartial and energetic judicial decisions,\r\nfor many centuries, that can be exhibited in any nation on earth. In\r\nthis point therefore I conceive the plan proposed in America to be an\r\nimprovement on the Roman constitution. In all free governments, that\r\nis, in all countries, where _laws govern_, and not _men_, the supreme\r\nmagistrate should have it in his power to execute any law, however\r\nunpopular, without hazarding his person or office. The laws are the\r\nsole _guardians_ of right, and when the magistrate dares not act, every\r\nperson is insecure.\r\n\r\nLet us now attend to the constitution and the powers of the senate.\r\n\r\nThe house of lords in England is wholly independent on(7) the people.\r\nThe lords spiritual hold their seats by office; and the people at\r\nlarge have no voice in disposing of the ecclesiastical dignities. The\r\ntemporal lords hold their seats by hereditary right or by grant from\r\nthe king: And it is a branch of the king’s prerogative to make what\r\npeers he pleases.\r\n\r\n[17] The senate in Rome was elective; but a senator held his seat for\r\nlife.(8)\r\n\r\n[18] The proposed senate in America is constituted on principles more\r\nfavorable to liberty: The members are elective, and by the separate\r\nlegislatures: They hold their seats for six years—they are thus\r\nrendered sufficiently dependent on their constituents; and yet are not\r\ndismissed from their office as soon as they become acquainted with the\r\nforms of proceeding.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected by the larger states, that the representation is not\r\nequal; the smallest states having the privilege of sending the same\r\nnumber of senators as the largest. To obviate this objection, I would\r\nsuggest but two or three ideas.\r\n\r\n1. If each state had a representation and a right in deciding\r\nquestions, proportional to its property, three states would almost\r\ncommand the whole. Such a constitution would gradually annihilate the\r\nsmall states; and finally melt down the whole United States into one\r\nundivided sovereignty. The free states of Spain and the heptarchy in\r\nEngland, afford striking examples of this.\r\n\r\n[19] Should it be said that such an event is desirable, I answer; the\r\nstates are all entitled to their respective sovereignties, and while\r\nthey claim independence in international jurisdiction, the federal\r\nconstitution ought to guarantee their sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration has weight—There is, in all nations, a\r\ntendency toward an accumulation of power in some point. It is the\r\nbusiness of the legislator to establish some barriers to check the\r\ntendency. In small societies, a man worth £.100,000 has but one vote,\r\nwhen his neighbors, who are worth but fifty pounds, have each one\r\nvote likewise. To make property the sole basis of authority, would\r\nexpose many of the best citizens to violence and oppression. To make\r\nthe number of inhabitants(9) in a state, the rule of apportioning\r\npower, is more equitable; and were the United States one indivisible\r\ninterest, would be a perfect rule for representation. But the detached\r\nsituation of the states has created some separate interests—some local\r\ninstitutions, which they will not resign nor throw into the hands of\r\nother states. For these peculiar interests, the states have an _equal_\r\nattachment—for the preservation and enjoyment of these, an _equal_\r\nsovereignty is necessary; and the sovereignty of each state would not\r\nbe secure, had each state, in both branches of the legislature an\r\nauthority in passing laws, proportioned to its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n3. But the senate should be considered as representing the confederacy\r\nin a body. It is a [20] false principle in the vulgar idea of\r\nrepresentation, that a man delegated by a particular district in\r\na state, is the representative of that district only; whereas in\r\ntruth a member of the legislature from any town or county, is the\r\nrepresentative of the whole state. In passing laws, he is to view the\r\nwhole collective interest of the state, and act from that view; not\r\nfrom a partial regard to the interest of the town or county where he is\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nThe same principle extends to the Congress of the United States.\r\nA delegate is bound to represent the true local interest of his\r\nconstituents—to state in its true light to the whole body—but when\r\neach provincial interest is thus stated, every member should act\r\nfor the _aggregate interest_ of the whole confederacy. The design\r\nof representation is to bring the collective interest into view—a\r\ndelegate is not the legislator of a single state—he is as much the\r\nlegislator of the whole confederacy as of the particular state where\r\nhe is chosen; and if he gives his vote for a law which he believes to\r\nbe beneficial to his own state only, and pernicious to the rest, he\r\nbetrays his trust and violates his oath. It is indeed difficult for a\r\nman to divest himself of local attachments and act from an impartial\r\nregard to the general good; but he who cannot for the most part do\r\nthis, is not a good legislator.\r\n\r\nThese considerations suggest the propriety of continuing the senators\r\nin office, for a longer period, than the representatives. They\r\ngradually lose their partiality, generalize their views, [21] and\r\nconsider themselves as acting for the whole confederacy. Hence in the\r\nsenate we may expect union and firmness—here we may find the _general\r\ngood_ the object of legislation, and a check upon the more partial and\r\ninterested acts of the other branch.\r\n\r\nThese considerations obviate the complaint, that the representation\r\nin the senate is not equal; for the senators represent the whole\r\nconfederacy; and all that is wanted of the members is information\r\nof the true situation and interest of each state. As they act under\r\nthe direction of the several legislatures, two men may as fully and\r\ncompletely represent a state, as twenty; and when the true interest\r\nof each state is known, if the senators perform the part of good\r\nlegislators, and act impartially for the whole collective body of the\r\nUnited States, it is totally immaterial where they are chosen.(10)\r\n\r\n[22] The house of representatives is the more immediate voice of the\r\nseparate states—here the states are represented in proportion to\r\ntheir number of inhabitants—here the separate interests will operate\r\nwith their full force, and the violence of parties and the jealousies\r\nproduced by interfering interests, can be restrained and quieted only\r\nby a body of men, less local and dependent.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that no separate interests should exist in a state;\r\nand a division of the legislature has a tendency to create them.\r\nBut this objection is founded on mere jealousy, or a very imperfect\r\ncomparison of the Roman and British governments, with the proposed\r\nfederal constitution.\r\n\r\nThe house of peers in England is a body originally and totally\r\nindependent on(11) the people—the senate in Rome was mostly composed of\r\npatrician or noble families, and after the first election of a senator,\r\nhe was no longer dependent on the people—he held his seat for life.\r\nBut the senate of the United States can have no separate interests from\r\nthe body of the people; for they live among them—they are chosen by\r\nthem—they _must_ be dismissed from their place once in six years and\r\n_may_ at any time be impeached for mal-practices—their property is\r\nsi- [23]tuated among the people, and with their persons, subject to the\r\nsame laws. No title can be granted, but the temporary titles of office,\r\nbestowed by the voluntary election of the people; and no pre-eminence\r\ncan be acquired but by the same means.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the legislature divides the\r\npower—checks—restrains—amends the proceedings—at the same time,\r\nit creates no division of interest, that can tempt either branch to\r\nencroach upon the other, or upon the people. In turbulent times, such\r\nrestraint is our greatest safety—in calm times, and in measures\r\nobviously calculated for the general good, both branches must always be\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nA man must be thirty years of age before he can be admitted into\r\nthe senate—which was likewise a requisite in the Roman government.\r\nWhat property was requisite for a senator in the early ages of\r\nRome, I cannot inform myself; but Augustus fixed it at six hundred\r\nsestertia—between six and seven thousand pounds sterling. In the\r\nfederal constitution, money is not made a requisite—the places of\r\nsenators are wisely left open to all persons of suitable age and merit,\r\nand who have been citizens of the United States for nine years; a term\r\nin which foreigners may acquire the feelings and acquaint themselves\r\nwith the interests, of the native Americans.\r\n\r\nThe house of representatives is formed on very equitable principles;\r\nand is calculated to guard the privileges of the people. The English\r\n[24] house of commons is chosen by a small part of the people of\r\nEngland, and continues for seven years. The Romans never discovered the\r\nsecret of representation—the whole body of citizens assembled for the\r\npurposes of legislation—a circumstance that exposed their government\r\nto frequent convulsions, and to capricious measures. The federal house\r\nof representatives is chosen by the people qualified to vote for state\r\nrepresentatives,(12) and continues two years.\r\n\r\n[25] Some may object to their continuance in power _two years_. But I\r\ncannot see any danger arising from this quarter. On the contrary, it\r\ncreates less trouble for the representatives, who by such choice are\r\ntaken from their professions and obliged to attend Congress, some of\r\nthem at the distance of at least seven hundred miles. While men are\r\nchosen by the people, and responsible to them, there is but little\r\ndanger from ambition or corruption.\r\n\r\nIf it should be said that Congress may in time become triennial, and\r\neven septennial, like the English parliaments, I answer, this is not\r\nin their power. The English parliament had power to prolong the period\r\nof their existence—but Congress will be restrained by the different\r\nlegislatures, without whose constitutional concurrence, no alteration\r\ncan be made in the proposed system.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section, article I, of the new constitution declares that\r\n“The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and\r\nrepresentatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature\r\nthereof; _but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such\r\nregulations, except as to the places of chusing senators_.” Here let\r\nus pause——What did the convention mean by giving Congress power to\r\n_make regulations_, prescribed by the legislatures? Is this expression\r\naccurate or intelligible? But the word _alter_ is very intelligible,\r\nand the clause puts the election of representatives _wholly_, and [26]\r\nthe senators _almost wholly_, in the power of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe views of the convention I believe to be perfectly upright—They\r\nmight mean to place the election of representatives and senators beyond\r\nthe reach of faction—They doubtless had good reasons, in _their_\r\nminds, for the clause—But I see no occasion for any power in Congress\r\nto interfere with the choice of their own body—They will have power\r\nto suppress insurrections, as they ought to have; but the clause in\r\n_Italics_ gives _needless_ and _dangerous_ powers—I hope the states\r\nwill reject it with decency, and adopt the whole system, without\r\naltering another syllable.(13)\r\n\r\nThe method of passing laws in Congress is much preferable to that of\r\nancient Rome or modern Britain. Not to mention other defects in Rome,\r\nit lay in the power of a single tribune to obstruct the passing of\r\na law. As the tribunes were popular magistrates, the right was often\r\nexercised in favor of liberty; but it was also abused, and the best\r\nregulations were prevented, to gratify the spleen, the ambition, or the\r\nresentment of an individual.\r\n\r\nThe king of Great-Britain has the same power, but seldom exercises it.\r\nIt is however a dangerous power—it is absurd and hazardous to lodge in\r\n_one man_ the right of controlling the will of a state.\r\n\r\nEvery bill that passes a majority of both houses of Congress, must be\r\nsent to the president for [27] his approbation; but it must be returned\r\nin ten days, whether approved by him or not; and the concurrence of\r\ntwo thirds of both houses passes the bill into a law, notwithstanding\r\nany objections of the president. The constitution therefore gives the\r\nsupreme executive a check but no negative, upon the sense of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe powers lodged in Congress are extensive; but it is presumed that\r\nthey are not too extensive. The first object of the constitution is\r\nto _unite_ the states into one _compact society_, for the purpose of\r\ngovernment. If such _union_ must exist, or the states be exposed to\r\nforeign invasions, internal discord, reciprocal encroachments upon each\r\nothers property—to weakness and infamy, which no person will dispute;\r\nwhat powers must be collected and lodged in the supreme head or\r\nlegislature of these states. The answer is easy: This legislature must\r\nhave exclusive jurisdiction in all matters in which the states have a\r\nmutual interest. There are some regulations in which all the states\r\nare equally concerned—there are others, which in their operation,\r\nare limited to one state. The first belongs to Congress—the last\r\nto the respective legislatures. No one state has a right to supreme\r\ncontrol, in any affair in which the other states have an interest,\r\nnor should Congress interfere in any affair which respects one state\r\nonly. This is the general line of division, which the convention have\r\nendeavored to draw, between the powers of Congress and the rights of\r\nthe individual states. The only question therefore is, whether the new\r\nconstitution delegates to Congress any powers which [28] do not respect\r\nthe general interest and welfare of the United States. If these powers\r\nintrench upon the present sovereignty of any _state_, without having\r\nfor an object the _collective interest_ of the whole, the powers are\r\ntoo extensive. But if they do not extend to all concerns, in which\r\nthe states have a mutual interest, they are too limited. If in any\r\ninstance, the powers necessary for protecting the _general_ interest,\r\ninterfere with the constitutional rights of an _individual state_, such\r\nstate has assumed powers that are inconsistent with the safety of the\r\nUnited States, and which ought instantly to be resigned. Considering\r\nthe states as individuals, on equal terms, entering into a social\r\ncompact, no state has a right to any power which may prejudice its\r\nneighbors. If therefore the federal constitution has collected into the\r\nfederal legislature no more power than is necessary for the _common\r\ndefence and interest_, it should be recognized by the states, however\r\nparticular clauses may supersede the exercise of certain powers by the\r\nindividual states.\r\n\r\nThis question is of vast magnitude. The states have very high ideas\r\nof their separate sovereignty; altho’ it is certain, that while each\r\nexists in its full latitude, we can have no _Federal sovereignty_.\r\nHowever flattered each state may be by its independent sovereignty, we\r\ncan have no union, no respectability, no national character, and what\r\nis more, no national justice, till the states resign to one _supreme\r\nhead_ the exclusive power of _legislating, judging and executing_,\r\nin all matters of a general nature. Every thing of [29] a private or\r\nprovincial nature, must still rest on the ground of the respective\r\nstate constitutions.\r\n\r\nAfter examining the limits of the proposed congressional powers, I\r\nconfess I do not think them too extensive—I firmly believe that the\r\nlife, liberty and property of every man, and the peace and independence\r\nof each state, will be more fully secured under such a constitution\r\nof federal government, than they will under a constitution with more\r\nlimited powers; and infinitely more safe than under our boasted\r\ndistinct sovereignties. It appears to me that Congress will have no\r\nmore power than will be necessary for our union and general welfare;\r\nand such power they must have or we are in a wretched state. On the\r\nadoption of this constitution, I should value real estate twenty per\r\ncent. higher than I do at this moment.\r\n\r\nI will not examine into the extent of the powers proposed to be\r\nlodged in the supreme federal head; the subject would be extensive\r\nand require more time than I could bestow upon it. But I will take up\r\nsome objections, that have been made to particular points of the new\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nMost of the objections I have yet heard to the constitution, consist\r\nin mere insinuations unsupported by reasoning or fact. They are thrown\r\nout to instil groundless jealousies into the minds of the people, and\r\nprobably with a view to prevent all government; for there are, in\r\nevery society, some turbulent geniuses whose importance [30] depends\r\nsolely on faction. To seek the insidious and detestable nature of\r\nthese insinuations, it is necessary to mention, and to remark on a few\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n1. The first objection against the constitution is, that the\r\nlegislature will be more expensive than our present confederation.\r\nThis is so far from being true, that the money we actually lose by our\r\npresent weakness, disunion and _want of government_ would support the\r\ncivil government of every state in the confederacy. Our public poverty\r\ndoes not proceed from the expensiveness of Congress, nor of the civil\r\nlist; but from want of power to command our own advantages. We pay more\r\nmoney to foreign nations, in the course of business, and merely for\r\n_want of government_, than would, under an efficient government, pay\r\nthe annual interest of our domestic debt. Every man in business knows\r\nthis to be _truth_; and the objection can be designed only to delude\r\nthe ignorant.\r\n\r\n2. Another objection to the constitution, is the division of the\r\nlegislature into two branches. Luckily this objection has no advocates\r\nbut in Pennsylvania; and even here their number is dwindling. The\r\nfactions that reign in this state, the internal discord and passions\r\nthat disturb the government and the peace of the inhabitants, have\r\ndetected the errors of the constitution, and will some time or other\r\nproduce a reformation. The division of the legislature has been the\r\nsubject of discussion in the beginning of this essay; and will be\r\ndeemed, by nineteen-twentieths of [31] the Americans, one of the\r\nprincipal excellencies of the constitution.\r\n\r\n3. A third insinuation, is that the proposed federal government will\r\nannihilate the several legislatures. This is extremely disingenuous.\r\nEvery person, capable of reading, must discover, that the convention\r\nhave labored to draw the line between the federal and provincial\r\npowers—to define the powers of Congress, and limit them to those\r\ngeneral concerns which _must_ come under federal jurisdiction, and\r\nwhich _cannot_ be managed in the separate legislatures—that in all\r\ninternal regulations, whether of civil or criminal nature, the states\r\nretain their sovereignty, and have it guaranteed to them by this very\r\nconstitution. Such a groundless insinuation, or rather mere surmise,\r\nmust proceed from dark designs or extreme ignorance, and deserves the\r\nseverest reprobation.\r\n\r\n4. It is alledged that the liberty of the press is not guaranteed by\r\nthe new constitution. But this objection is wholly unfounded. The\r\nliberty of the press does not come within the jurisdiction of federal\r\ngovernment. It is firmly established in all the states either by law,\r\nor positive declarations in _bills of right_; and not being mentioned\r\nin the federal constitution, is not—and cannot be abridged by\r\nCongress. It stands on the basis of the respective state-constitutions.\r\nShould any state resign to Congress the exclusive jurisdiction of a\r\ncertain district, which should include any town where presses are\r\nalready established, it is in the power of the state to reserve [32]\r\nthe liberty of the press, or any other fundamental privilege, and make\r\nit an immutable condition of the grant, that such rights shall never\r\nbe violated. All objections therefore on this score are “_baseless\r\nvisions_.”\r\n\r\n5. It is insinuated that the constitution gives Congress the power of\r\nlevying internal taxes at pleasure. This insinuation seems founded on\r\nthe eighth section of the first article, which declares, that “Congress\r\nshall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises,\r\nto pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare\r\nof the United States.”\r\n\r\nThat Congress should have power to collect duties, imposts and\r\nexcises, in order to render them uniform throughout the United States\r\nwill hardly be controverted. The whole objection is to the right of\r\nlevying internal taxes.\r\n\r\nBut it will be conceded that the supreme head of the states must have\r\npower, competent to the purposes of our union, or it will be, as it now\r\nis, a _useless body_, a mere expense, without any advantage. To pay our\r\npublic debt, to support foreign ministers and our own civil government,\r\nmoney must be raised; and if the duties and imposts are not adequate to\r\nthese purposes, where shall the money be obtained? It will be answered,\r\nlet Congress apportion the sum to be raised, and leave the legislatures\r\nto collect the money. Well this is all that is intended by the clause\r\nunder consideration; with the addition of a fe- [33] deral power that\r\nshall be sufficient to oblige a delinquent state to comply with the\r\nrequisition.(14) Such power must exist somewhere, or the debts of the\r\nUnited States can never be paid. For want of such power, our credit is\r\nlost and our national faith is a bye-word.\r\n\r\nFor want of such power, one state now complies fully with a\r\nrequisition, another partially, and a third absolutely refuses or\r\nneglects to grant a shilling. Thus the honest and punctual are doubly\r\nloaded—and the knave triumphs in his negligence. In short, no honest\r\nman will dread a power that shall enforce an equitable system of\r\ntaxation. The dis-honest are ever apprehensive of a power that shall\r\noblige them to do what honest men are ready to do voluntarily.\r\n\r\nPermit me to ask those who object to this power of taxation, how shall\r\nmoney be raised to discharge our honest debts which are universally\r\nacknowledged to be just? Have we not already experienced the inefficacy\r\nof a system without power? Has it not been proved to demonstration,\r\nthat a voluntary compliance with the demands of the union can never\r\nbe expected? To what expedient shall we have recourse? What is the\r\nresort of all governments in cases of delinquency? Do not the states\r\nvest in the legislature, or even in the governor and council, a power\r\nto enforce laws, even with the militia of the states? And how rarely\r\ndoes there exist the necessity of exerting such a power? Why should\r\nsuch a power be more dangerous in Congress than in a legislature? Why\r\nshould [34] more confidence be reposed in a member of one legislature\r\nthan of another? Why should we choose the best men in the state\r\nto represent us in Congress, and the moment they are elected arm\r\nourselves against them as against tyrants and robbers? Do we not, in\r\nthis conduct, act the part of a man, who, as soon as he has married\r\na woman of unsuspected chastity, locks her up in a dungeon? Is there\r\nany spell or charm, that instantly changes a delegate to Congress\r\nfrom an honest man into a knave—a tyrant? I confess freely that I am\r\nwilling to trust Congress with any powers that I should dare lodge in a\r\nstate-legislature. I believe life, liberty, and property is as safe in\r\nthe hands of a federal legislature, organized in the manner proposed by\r\nthe convention, as in the hands of any legislature, that has ever been\r\nor ever will be chosen in any particular state.\r\n\r\nBut the idea that Congress can levy taxes _at pleasure_ is false, and\r\nthe suggestion wholly unsupported. The preamble to the constitution\r\nis declaratory of the purposes of our union and the assumption of\r\nany powers not necessary to _establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity_, will be unconstitutional, and endanger the existence of\r\nCongress. Besides, in the very clause which gives the power of levying\r\nduties and taxes, the purposes to which the money shall be appropriated\r\nare specified, viz. _to pay the debts and provide for the common\r\nde-_ [35] _fence and general welfare of the United States_.(15) For these\r\npurposes money must be collected, and the power of collection must be\r\nlodged, sooner or later, in a federal head; or the common defence and\r\ngeneral welfare must be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe states in their separate capacity, cannot provide for the common\r\ndefence; nay in case of a civil war, a state cannot secure its own\r\nexistence. The only question therefore is, whether it is necessary to\r\nunite, and provide for our _common defence and general welfare_. For\r\nthis question being once decided in the affirmative, leaves no room to\r\ncontrovert the propriety of constituting a power over the whole United\r\nStates, adequate to these general purposes.\r\n\r\nThe states, by granting such power, do not throw it out of their own\r\nhands—they only throw, each its proportion, into a common stock—they\r\nmerely combine the powers of the several states into one point, where\r\nthey _must_ be collected, before they _can_ be exerted. But the powers\r\nare still in their own hands; and cannot be alienated, till they create\r\na body independent of them- [36] selves, with a force at their command,\r\nsuperior to the whole yeomanry of the country.\r\n\r\n6. It is said there is no provision made in the new constitution\r\nagainst a standing army in time of peace. Why do not people object\r\nthat no provision is made against the introduction of a body of\r\nTurkish Janizaries; or against making the Alcoran the rule of faith\r\nand practice, instead of the Bible? The answer to such objections is\r\nsimply this—_no such provision is necessary_. The people in this\r\ncountry cannot forget their apprehensions from a British standing\r\narmy, quartered in America; and they turn their fears and jealousies\r\nagainst themselves. Why do not the people of most of the states\r\napprehend danger from standing armies from their own legislatures?\r\nPennsylvania and North Carolina, I believe, are the only states that\r\nhave provided against this danger at all events. Other states have\r\ndeclared that “no standing armies shall be kept up without the consent\r\nof the legislature.” But this leaves the power entirely in the hands of\r\nthe legislature. Many of the states however have made _no provision_\r\nagainst this evil. What hazards these states suffer! Why does not a\r\nman pass a law in his family, that no armed soldier shall be quartered\r\nin his house by his consent? The reason is very plain: no man will\r\nsuffer his liberty to be abridged, or endangered—his disposition and\r\nhis power are uniformly opposed to any infringement of his rights. In\r\nthe same manner, the principles and habits, as well as the power of\r\nthe Americans are directly opposed to standing armies: and there is as\r\nlittle [37] necessity to guard against them by positive constitutions,\r\nas to prohibit the establishment of the Mahometan religion. But the\r\nconstitution provides for our safety; and while it gives Congress power\r\nto raise armies, it declares that no appropriation of money to their\r\nsupport shall be for a longer term than two years.\r\n\r\nCongress likewise are to have power to provide for organizing, arming\r\nand disciplining the militia, but have no other command of them, except\r\nwhen in actual service. Nor are they at liberty to call out the militia\r\nat pleasure—but only, to execute the laws of the union, suppress\r\ninsurrections, and repel invasions. For these purposes, government must\r\nalways be armed with a military force, if the occasion should require\r\nit; otherwise laws are nugatory, and life and property insecure.\r\n\r\n7. Some persons have ventured to publish an intimation, that by the\r\nproposed constitution, the trial by jury is abolished in all _civil\r\ncases_. Others very modestly insinuate, that it is in _some cases_\r\nonly. The fact is, that trial by jury is not affected in _any_ case,\r\nby the constitution; except in cases of impeachment, which are to be\r\ntried by the senate. None but persons in office in or under Congress\r\ncan be impeached; and even after a judgment upon an impeachment, the\r\noffender is liable to a prosecution, before a common jury, in a regular\r\ncourse of law. The insinuation therefore that trials by jury are to\r\nbe abolished, is groundless, and beyond conception, wicked. It must\r\nbe wicked, because the circu- [38] lation of a barefaced falsehood,\r\nrespecting a privilege, dear to freemen, can proceed only from a\r\ndepraved heart and the worst intentions.\r\n\r\n8. It is also intimated as a probable event, that the federal courts\r\nwill absorb the judiciaries of the federal states. This is a mere\r\nsuspicion, without the least foundation. The jurisdiction of the\r\nfederal states is very accurately defined and easily understood.\r\nIt extends to the cases mentioned in the constitution, and to the\r\nexecution of the laws of Congress, respecting commerce, revenue, and\r\nother general concerns.\r\n\r\nWith respect to other civil and criminal actions, the powers and\r\njurisdiction of the several judiciaries of each state, remain\r\nunimpaired. Nor is there anything novel in allowing appeals to\r\nthe supreme court. Actions are mostly to be tried in the state\r\nwhere the crimes are committed—But appeals are allowed under our\r\npresent confederation, and no person complains; nay, were there no\r\nappeal, every man would have reason to complain, especially when a\r\nfinal judgement, in an inferior court, should affect property to a\r\nlarge amount. But why is an objection raised against an appellate\r\njurisdiction in the supreme court, respecting _fact_ as well as _law_?\r\nIs it less safe to have the opinions of two juries than of one? I\r\nsuspect many people will think this is no defect in the constitution.\r\nBut perhaps it will destroy a material requisite of a good jury, viz.\r\ntheir vicinity to the cause of action. I have no doubt, that when\r\ncauses were tried, in periods prior to the Christian æra, before [39]\r\ntwelve men, seated upon twelve stones, arranged in a circular form,\r\nunder a huge oak, there was great propriety in submitting causes to\r\nmen _in the vicinity_. The difficulty of collecting evidence, in those\r\nrude times, rendered it necessary that juries should judge mostly\r\nfrom their own knowledge of facts or from information obtained out of\r\ncourt. But in these polished ages, when juries depend almost wholly\r\non the testimony of witnesses; and when a complication of interests,\r\nintroduced by commerce and other causes, renders it almost impossible\r\nto collect men, in the vicinity of the parties, who are wholly\r\ndisinterested, it is no disadvantage to have a cause tried by a jury of\r\nstrangers. Indeed the latter is generally the most eligible.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, the creation of all inferior courts is in the power\r\nof Congress; and the constitution provides that Congress may make such\r\nexceptions from the right of appeals as they shall judge proper. When\r\nthese courts are erected, their jurisdictions will be ascertained, and\r\nin small actions, Congress will doubtless direct that a sentence in a\r\nsubordinate court shall, to a certain amount, be definite and final.\r\nAll objections therefore to the judicial powers of the federal courts\r\nappear to me as trifling as any of the preceding.\r\n\r\n9. But, say the enemies of slavery, negroes may be imported for\r\ntwenty-one years. This exception is addressed to the quakers; and a\r\nvery pitiful exception it is.\r\n\r\n[40] The truth is, Congress cannot prohibit the importation of\r\nslaves during that period; but the laws against the importation into\r\nparticular states, stand unrepealed. An immediate abolition of slavery\r\nwould bring ruin upon the whites, and misery upon the blacks, in the\r\nsouthern states. The constitution has therefore wisely left each\r\nstate to pursue its own measures, with respect to this article of\r\nlegislation, during the period of twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal objections that have yet been made by the\r\nenemies of the new constitution. They are mostly frivolous, or founded\r\non false constructions, and a misrepresentation of the true state of\r\nfacts. They are evidently designed to raise groundless jealousies\r\nin the minds of well meaning people, who have little leisure and\r\nopportunity to examine into the principles of government. But a little\r\ntime and reflection will enable most people to detect such mischievous\r\nintentions; and the spirit and firmness which have distinguished the\r\nconduct of the Americans, during the conflict for independence, will\r\neventually triumph over the enemies of union, and bury them in disgrace\r\nor oblivion.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot quit this subject without attempting to correct some of\r\nthe erroneous opinions respecting _freedom_ and _tyranny_, and the\r\nprinciples by which they are supported. Many people seem to entertain\r\nan idea, that liberty consists in _a power to act without any control_.\r\nThis is more liberty than even the savages enjoy. But in civil society,\r\npolitical liberty consists in [41] _acting conformably to a sense\r\nof a majority of the society_. In a free government every man binds\r\nhimself to obey the _public voice_, or the opinions of a majority; and\r\nthe _whole society_ engages to _protect each individual_. In such a\r\ngovernment a man is _free_ and safe. But reverse the case; suppose\r\nevery man to act without control or fear of punishment—every man would\r\nbe free, but no man would be sure of his freedom one moment. Each would\r\nhave the power of taking his neighbor’s life, liberty, or property; and\r\nno man would command more than his own strength to repel the invasion.\r\nThe case is the same with states. If the states should not unite into\r\none compact society, every state may trespass upon its neighbor, and\r\nthe injured state has no means of redress but its own military force.\r\n\r\nThe present situation of our American states is very little better\r\nthan a state of nature—Our boasted state sovereignties are so far\r\nfrom securing our liberty and property, that they, every moment,\r\nexpose us to the loss of both. That state which commands the heaviest\r\npurse and longest sword, may at any moment, lay its weaker neighbor\r\nunder tribute; and there is no superior power now existing, that can\r\nregularly oppose the invasion or redress the injury. From such liberty,\r\nO(16) Lord, deliver us!\r\n\r\nBut what is tyranny? Or how can a free people be deprived of their\r\nliberties? Tyranny is the exercise of some power over a man, which is\r\nnot warranted by law, or necessary for the public safety. A people can\r\nnever be deprived of [42] their liberties, while they retain in their\r\nown hands, a power sufficient to any other power in the state. This\r\nposition leads me directly to enquire, in what consists the power of a\r\nnation or of an order of men?\r\n\r\nIn some nations, legislators have derived much of their power from the\r\ninfluence of religion, or from that implicit belief which an ignorant\r\nand superstitious people entertain of the gods, and their interposition\r\nin every transaction of life. The Roman senate sometimes availed\r\nthemselves of this engine to carry their decrees and maintain their\r\nauthority. This was particularly the case, under the aristocracy which\r\nsucceeded the abolition of the monarchy. The augurs and priests were\r\ntaken wholly from patrician families.(17) They constituted a distinct\r\norder of men—had power to negative any law of the people, by declaring\r\nthat it was passed during the taking of the auspices.(18)(19) This\r\ninfluence derived from the authority of opinion, was less perceptible,\r\nbut as tyrannical as a military force. The same influence constitutes,\r\nat this day, a principal support of federal governments on the Eastern\r\ncontinent, and perhaps in South America. But in North America, by a\r\nsingular concurrence of circumstances, the possibility of establishing\r\nthis influence, as a pillar of government, is totally precluded.\r\n\r\n[43] Another source of power in government is a military force. But\r\nthis, to be efficient, must be superior to any force that exists among\r\nthe people, or which they can command: for otherwise this force would\r\nbe annihilated, on the first exercise of acts of oppression. Before a\r\nstanding army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in\r\nalmost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot\r\nenforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people\r\nare armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular\r\ntroops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A\r\nmilitary force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but\r\nsuch as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they\r\nwill possess the _power_, and jealousy will instantly inspire the\r\n_inclination_, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them\r\nunjust and oppressive. In spite of all the nominal powers, vested in\r\nCongress by the constitution, were the system once adopted in its\r\nfullest latitude, still the actual exercise of them would be frequently\r\ninterrupted by popular jealousy. I am bold to say, that _ten_ just\r\nand constitutional measures would be resisted, where _one_ unjust or\r\noppressive law would be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe powers vested in Congress are little more than _nominal_; nay\r\n_real_ power cannot be vested in them, nor in any body, but in the\r\n_people_. The source of power is in the _people_ of this country, and\r\ncannot for ages, and probably never will, be removed.(20)\r\n\r\nIn what then does _real_ power consist? The answer is short and\r\nplain—in _property_. Could [44] we want any proofs of this, which are\r\nnot exhibited in this country, the uniform testimony of history will\r\nfurnish us with multitudes. But I will go no farther for proof, than\r\nthe two governments already mentioned, the Roman and the British.\r\n\r\nRome exhibited a demonstrative proof of the inseparable connexion\r\nbetween property and dominion. The first form of its government was an\r\nelective monarchy—its second, an aristocracy; but these forms could\r\nnot be permanent, because they were not supported by property. The\r\nkings at first and afterwards the patricians had nominally most of the\r\npower; but the people, possessing most of the lands, never ceased to\r\nassert their privileges, till they established a commonwealth. And the\r\nkings and senate could not have held the reigns of government in their\r\nhands so long as they did, had they not artfully contrived to manage\r\nthe established religion, and play off the superstitious credulity of\r\nthe people against their own power. “Thus this weak constitution of\r\ngovernment,” says the ingenious Mr. Moyle, speaking of the aristocracy\r\nof Rome, “not founded on the true _center of dominion_, _land_, nor on\r\nany standing foundation of authority, nor rivetted in the esteem and\r\naffections of the people; and being attacked by strong passion, general\r\ninterest and the joint forces of the people, mouldered away of course,\r\nand pined of a lingering consumption, till it was totally swallowed\r\nup by the prevailing faction, and the nobility were moulded into the\r\nmass of the people.”(21) The people, notwithstanding [45] the nominal\r\nauthority of the patricians, proceeded regularly in enlarging their\r\nown powers. They first extorted from the senate, the right of electing\r\n_tribunes_, with a negative upon the proceedings of the senate.(22)\r\nThey obtained the right of proposing and debating laws; which before\r\nhad been vested in the senate; and finally advanced to the power of\r\nenacting laws, without the authority of the senate.(23) They regained\r\nthe rights of election in their comitia, of which they had been\r\ndeprived by Servius Tullius.(24) They procured a permanent body of laws,\r\ncollected from the Grecian institutions. They destroyed the influence\r\nof augurs, or diviners, by establishing the _tributa comitia_, in which\r\nthey were not allowed to consult the gods. They increased their power\r\nby large accessions of conquered lands. They procured a repeal of the\r\nlaw which prohibited marriages between the patricians and plebians.(25)\r\nThe Licinian law limited all possessions to five hundred acres of\r\nland; which, had it been fully executed, would have secured the\r\ncommonwealth.(26)\r\n\r\nThe Romans proceeded thus step by step to triumph over the aristocracy,\r\nand to crown their privileges, they procured the right of being elected\r\nto the highest offices of the state. By acquiring _the property_ of the\r\nplebians, the nobility, several times, held most of the power of the\r\nstate; but the people, by reducing the interest of money, abolishing\r\ndebts, or by forcing [46] other advantages from the patricians,\r\ngenerally held the power of governing in their own hands.\r\n\r\nIn America, we begin our empire with more popular privileges than the\r\nRomans ever enjoyed. We have not to struggle against a monarch or an\r\naristocracy—power is lodged in the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the English history, we observe a progress similar to\r\nthat in Rome—an incessant struggle for liberty from the date of\r\nMagna Charta, in John’s reign, to the revolution. The struggle has\r\nbeen successful, by abridging the enormous power of the nobility.\r\nBut we observe that the power of the people has increased in an\r\nexact proportion to their acquisitions of property. Wherever the\r\nright of primogeniture is established, property must accumulate and\r\nremain in families. Thus the landed property in England will never be\r\nsufficiently distributed, to give the powers of government wholly\r\ninto the hands of the people. But to assist the struggle for liberty,\r\ncommerce has interposed, and in conjunction with manufacturers,\r\nthrown a vast weight of property into the democratic scale. Wherever\r\nwe cast our eyes, we see this truth, that _property_ is the basis of\r\n_power_; and this, being established as a cardinal point, directs\r\nus to the means of preserving our freedom. Make laws, irrevocable\r\nlaws in every state, destroying and barring entailments; leave real\r\nestates to revolve from hand to hand, as time and accident may\r\ndirect; and no family influence can be acquired and established for\r\na series of genera- [47] tions—no man can obtain dominion over a\r\nlarge territory—the laborious and saving, who are generally the best\r\ncitizens, will possess each his share of property and power, and thus\r\nthe balance of wealth and power will continue where it is, in the _body\r\nof the people_.\r\n\r\n_A general and tolerably equal distribution of landed property is the\r\nwhole basis of national freedom_: The system of the great Montesquieu\r\nwill ever be erroneous, till the words _property or lands in fee\r\nsimple_ are substituted for _virtue_, throughout his _Spirit of Laws_.\r\n\r\n_Virtue_, patriotism, or love of country, never was and never will\r\nbe, till mens’ natures are changed, a fixed, permanent principle and\r\nsupport of government. But in an agricultural country, a general\r\npossession of land in fee simple, may be rendered perpetual, and the\r\ninequalities introduced by commerce, are too fluctuating to endanger\r\ngovernment. An equality of property, with a necessity of alienation,\r\nconstantly operating to destroy combinations of powerful families, is\r\nthe very _soul of a republic_—While this continues, the people will\r\ninevitably possess both _power_ and _freedom_; when this is lost, power\r\ndeparts, liberty expires, and a commonwealth will inevitably assume\r\nsome other form.\r\n\r\nThe liberty of the press, trial by jury, the Habeas Corpus writ,\r\neven Magna Charta itself, although justly deemed the palladia of\r\nfreedom, are all inferior considerations, when compared with a general\r\ndistribution of real property among [48] every class of people.(27)\r\nThe power of entailing estates is more dangerous to liberty and\r\nrepublican government, than all the constitutions that can be written\r\non paper, or even than a standing army. Let the people have property,\r\nand they _will_ have power—a power that will for ever be exerted to\r\nprevent a restriction of the press, and abolition of trial by jury,\r\nor the abridgement of any other privilege. The liberties of America,\r\ntherefore, and her forms of government, stand on the broadest basis.\r\nRemoved from the fears of a foreign invasion and conquest, they are\r\n[49] not exposed to the convulsions that shake other governments; and\r\nthe principles of freedom are so general and energetic, as to exclude\r\nthe possibility of a change in our republican constitutions.\r\n\r\nBut while _property_ is considered as the _basis_ of the freedom of\r\nthe American yeomanry, there are other auxiliary supports; among which\r\nis the _information of the people_. In no country, is education so\r\ngeneral—in no country, have the body of the people such a knowledge of\r\nthe rights of men and the principles of government. This knowledge,\r\njoined with a keen sense of liberty and a watchful jealousy, will guard\r\nour constitutions, and awaken the people to an instantaneous resistance\r\nof encroachments.\r\n\r\nBut a principal bulwark of freedom is the _right of election_. An\r\nequal distribution of property is the _foundation_ of a republic; but\r\n_popular elections_ form the _great barrier_, which defends it from\r\nassault, and guards it from the slow and imperceptible approaches of\r\ncorruption. Americans! never resign that right. It is not very material\r\nwhether your representatives are elected for one year or two—but the\r\n_right_ is the Magna Charta of your governments. For this reason,\r\nexpunge that clause of the new constitution before mentioned, which\r\ngives Congress an influence in the election of their own body. The\r\n_time_, _place_ and _manner_ of chusing senators or representatives are\r\nof little or no consequence to Congress. The number of members and time\r\nof meeting in Congress are fixed; but the _choice_ should rest with the\r\nseveral states. [50] I repeat it—reject the clause with decency, but\r\nwith unanimity and firmness.(28)\r\n\r\nExcepting that clause the constitution is good(29)—it guarantees the\r\n_fundamental principles_ of our several constitutions—it guards our\r\nrights—and while it vests extensive powers in Congress, it vests no\r\nmore than are necessary for our union. Without powers lodged somewhere\r\nin a single body, fully competent to lay and collect equal taxes\r\nand duties—to adjust controversies between different states—to\r\nsilence contending interests—to suppress insurrections—to regulate\r\ncommerce—to treat with foreign nations, our confederation is a\r\ncobweb—liable to be blown asunder by every blast of faction that is\r\nraised in the remotest corner of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery motive that can possibly influence men ever to unite under civil\r\ngovernment, now urges the unanimous adoption of the new constitution.\r\nBut in America we are urged to it by a singular necessity. By the local\r\nsituation of the several states _a few_ command _all_ the advantages of\r\ncommerce. Those states which have no advantages, made equal exertions\r\nfor independence, loaded themselves with immense debts, and now are\r\nutterly(30) unable to discharge them; while their richer neighbors\r\nare taxing them for their own benefit, merely because they _can_. I\r\ncan prove to a demonstration that Connecticut, which has the heaviest\r\ninternal or state debt, in proportion to its number of inhabitants,\r\nof any in the union, cannot discharge its debt, on any principles of\r\ntaxation ever yet practised. Yet [51] the state pays in duties, at\r\nleast 100,000 dollars annually, on goods consumed by its own people,\r\nbut imported by New York. This sum, could it be saved to the state by\r\nan equal system of revenue, would enable that state to gradually sink\r\nits debt.(31)(32)\r\nNew Jersey and some other states are in the same situation, except\r\nthat their debts are not so large, in proportion to their wealth and\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the several states were not drawn with a view to\r\nindependence; and while this country was subject to Great Britain,\r\nthey produced no commercial or political inconveniences. But the\r\nrevolution has placed things on a different footing. The advantages\r\nof some states, and the disadvantages of others are so great—and so\r\nmaterially affect the business and interest of each, that nothing but\r\nan equalizing system of revenue, that shall reduce the advantages\r\nto some equitable proportion, can prevent a civil war and save the\r\nnational debt. Such a system of revenue is the _sine qua non_ of public\r\njustice and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd for a man to oppose the adoption of the constitution,\r\nbecause _he_ thinks some part of it defective or exceptionable.\r\nLet every man be at liberty to expunge what _he_ judges to be\r\nexceptionable, and not a syllable of the constitution [52] will\r\nsurvive the scrutiny. A painter, after executing a masterly piece,\r\nrequested every spectator to draw a pencil mark over the part that\r\ndid not please him; but to his surprise, he soon found the _whole\r\npiece_ defaced. Let every man examine the most perfect building by his\r\n_own_ taste, and like some microscopic critics, condemn the _whole_\r\nfor small deviations from the rules of architecture, and not a part\r\nof the _best_ constructed fabric would escape. But let _any_ man take\r\na _comprehensive view_ of the whole, and he will be pleased with the\r\ngeneral beauty and proportions, and admire the structure. The same\r\nremarks apply to the new constitution. I have no doubt that _every_\r\nmember of the late convention has exceptions to _some part_ of the\r\nsystem proposed. Their constituents have the same, and if _every_\r\nobjection must be removed, before we have a national government, the\r\nLord have mercy on us.\r\n\r\nPerfection is not the lot of humanity. Instead of censuring the small\r\nfaults of the constitution, I am astonished that so many clashing\r\ninterests have been reconciled—and so many sacrifices made to the\r\n_general interest_! The mutual concessions made by the gentlemen of the\r\nconvention, reflect the highest honor on their candor and liberality;\r\nat the same time, they prove that their minds were deeply impressed\r\nwith a conviction, that such mutual sacrifices are _essential to\r\nour union_. They _must_ be made sooner or later by every state; or\r\njealousies, local interests and prejudices will unsheath the sword, and\r\nsome Cæsar or Cromwell will avail himself [53] of our divisions, and\r\nwade to a throne through streams of blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not our duty as freemen, to receive the opinions of any men\r\nhowever great and respectable, without an examination. But when\r\nwe reflect that(33) some of the greatest men in America, with the\r\nvenerable FRANKLIN and the illustrious WASHINGTON at their head; _some_\r\nof them the _fathers_ and _saviors_ of their country, men who have\r\nlabored at the helm during a long and violent tempest, and guided us to\r\nthe haven of peace—and _all_ of them distinguished for their abilities\r\ntheir acquaintance with ancient and modern governments, as well as\r\nwith the temper, the passions, the interests and the wishes of the\r\nAmericans;—when we reflect on these circumstances, it is impossible to\r\nresist impressions of respect, and we are almost impelled to suspect\r\nour own judgements, when we call in question any part of the system,\r\nwhich they have recommended for adoption. Not having the same means of\r\ninformation, we are more liable to mistake the nature and tendency of\r\nparticular articles of the constitution, or the reasons on which they\r\nwere admitted. Great confidence therefore should be reposed in the\r\nabilities, the zeal and integrity of that respectable body. But after\r\nall, if the constitution should, in its future operation, be found\r\ndefective or inconvenient, two-thirds of both houses of Congress or the\r\napplication of two-thirds of the legislatures, may open the door for\r\namendments. Such improvements may then be made, as experience shall\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\n[54] Let us then consider the _New Federal Constitution_, as it really\r\nis, an _improvement_ on the _best_ constitutions that the world ever\r\nsaw. In the house of representatives, the people of America have\r\nan equal voice and suffrage. The choice of men is placed in the\r\nfreemen or electors at large; and the frequency of elections, and the\r\nresponsibility of the members, will render them sufficiently dependent\r\non their constituents. The senate will be composed of older men;\r\nand while their regular dismission from office, once in six years,\r\nwill preserve their dependence on their constituents, the duration\r\nof their existence will give firmness to their decisions, and temper\r\nthe factions which must necessarily prevail in the other branch. The\r\npresident of the United States is elective, and what is a capital\r\nimprovement on the best governments, the mode of chusing him excludes\r\nthe danger of faction and corruption.(34) As the supreme executive, he\r\nis invested with power to enforce the laws of the union and give energy\r\nto the federal government.\r\n\r\nThe constitution defines the powers of Congress; and every power\r\nnot expressly delegated to that body, remains in the several\r\nstate-legislatures. The sovereignty and the republican form of\r\ngovernment of each state is guaranteed by the constitution; and the\r\nbounds of jurisdiction between the federal and respective state\r\ngovernments, are marked with precision. In theory, it has all the\r\nenergy and freedom of the British and Roman governments, without their\r\ndefects. In short, the privileges of freemen are [55] interwoven into\r\nthe feelings and habits of the Americans; _liberty_ stands on the\r\nimmoveable basis of a general distribution of property and diffusion\r\nof knowledge; but the Americans must cease to contend, to fear, and\r\nto hate, before they can realize the benefits of independence and\r\ngovernment, or enjoy the blessings, which heaven has lavished, in rich\r\nprofusion, upon this western world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn / Address / to the / People / of the / State of New-York / On the\r\nSubject of the / Constitution, / Agreed upon at Philadelphia, / The\r\n17th of September, 1787. / New-York: / Printed by Samuel Loudon, /\r\nPrinter to the State. [1788].\r\n\r\n  Sm. 4to., pp. 19.\r\n\r\n  By John Jay, member of the New York State Convention. The pamphlet has\r\n  been partially reprinted in Elliot, I, 496.\r\n\r\n  “The good sense, forcible observations, temper and moderation with\r\n  which the pamphlet is written, cannot fail, I should think, of making\r\n  a serious impression upon the anti-federal mind, where it is not under\r\n  the influence of such local views as will yield to no argument, no\r\n  proof.”—George Washington.\r\n\r\n  “I likewise send you a small pamphlet written by John Jay about\r\n  ten days since, and which has had a most astonishing influence in\r\n  converting anti-federalism to a knowledge and belief that the new\r\n  Constitution was their only political salvation.”—S. B. Webb, 27\r\n  April, 1788.\r\n\r\n  “This pamphlet contains a brief recapitulation of the most striking\r\n  arguments in favor of adopting the proposed Federal Constitution.\r\n  Several of the observations are new, and all are penned with such\r\n  moderation of temper, and sound judgment, that they cannot fail to make\r\n  an impression favorable to the Constitution on minds which are open to\r\n  conviction. It is wished that every friend to good order and government\r\n  might ‘receive this address with the same candor with which it is\r\n  written,’ as it is believed the author’s arguments against appointing\r\n  a new general Convention, for the purpose of altering and amending the\r\n  constitution, are altogether unanswerable.” [Noah Webster] in _American\r\n  Magazine_ for April, 1788.\r\n\r\n  See Jay’s _Life of Jay_, I, 362; _The Federalist_, LXXXV; and\r\n  the “Postcript” of _An Address to the People of the State of New\r\n  York_.—_By a Plebian_, infra.\r\n\r\n   P. L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friends and Fellow Citizens_:\r\n\r\nThere are times and seasons, when _general evils_ spread general\r\nalarm and uneasiness, and yet arise from causes too complicated, and\r\ntoo little understood by many, to produce an unanimity of opinions\r\nrespecting their remedies. Hence it is, that on such occasions, the\r\nconflict of arguments too often excites a conflict of passions, and\r\nintroduces a degree of discord and animosity, which, by agitating the\r\npublic mind dispose it to precipitation and extravagance. They who on\r\nthe ocean have been unexpectedly enveloped with tempests, or suddenly\r\nentangled among rocks and shoals, know the value of that serene,\r\nself-possession and presence of mind, to which in such cases they owed\r\ntheir preservation; nor will the heroes who have given us victory and\r\npeace, hesitate to acknowledge that we are as much indebted for those\r\nblessings to the calm prevision, and cool intrepidity which planned and\r\nconducted our military measures, as to the glowing animation with which\r\nthey were executed.\r\n\r\nWhile reason retains her rule, while men are as ready to receive as to\r\ngive advice, and as willing to be convinced themselves, as to convince\r\nothers, there are few political evils from which a free and enlightened\r\npeople cannot deliver themselves. It is unquestionably true, that the\r\ngreat body of the people love their country, and wish it prosperity;\r\nand this observation is particularly applicable to the people of a\r\n_free_ country, for they have more and stronger reasons for loving it\r\nthan others. It is not therefore to vicious motives that the unhappy\r\ndivisions which sometimes prevail among them are to be imputed; the\r\npeople at large always mean well, and although they may on certain\r\noc- [4] casions be misled by the counsels, or injured by the efforts\r\nof the few who expect more advantage from the wreck, than from the\r\npreservation of national prosperity, yet the motives of these few, are\r\nby no means to be confounded with those of the community in general.\r\n\r\nThat such seeds of discord and danger have been disseminated and begin\r\nto take root in America, as unless eradicated will soon poison our\r\ngardens and our fields, is a truth much to be lamented; and the more\r\nso, as their growth rapidly increases, while we are wasting the season\r\nin honestly but imprudently disputing, not whether they shall be pulled\r\nup, but by whom, in what manner, and with what instruments, the work\r\nshall be done.\r\n\r\nWhen the king of Great Britain, misguided by men who did not merit\r\nhis confidence, asserted the unjust claim of binding us in all cases\r\nwhatsoever, and prepared to obtain our submission by force, the object\r\nwhich engrossed our attention, however important, was nevertheless\r\nplain and simple, “What shall we do?” was the question—the people\r\nanswered, let us unite our counsels and our arms. They sent Delegates\r\nto Congress, and soldiers to the field. Confiding in the probity\r\nand wisdom of Congress, they received their recommendations as if\r\nthey had been laws; and that ready acquiesence in their advice\r\nenabled those patriots to save their country. Then there was little\r\nleisure or disposition for controversy respecting the expediency of\r\nmeasures—hostile fleets soon filled our ports, and hostile armies\r\nspread desolation on our shores. Union was then considered as the most\r\nessential of human means and we almost worshipped it with as much\r\nfervor, as pagans in distress formerly implored the protection of their\r\ntutelar deities. That union was the child of wisdom—heaven blessed it,\r\nand it wrought out our political salvation.\r\n\r\nThat glorious war was succeeded by an advantageous peace. When danger\r\ndisappeared, ease, tranquility, and a sense of security loosened the\r\nbands of union; and Congress and soldiers and good faith depreciated\r\nwith their apparent importance. Recommendations lost their influence,\r\nand requisitions were rendered nugatory, not by their want of\r\npropriety, but by their want of power. The spirit of private gain\r\nexpelled the spirit of public good, and men became more intent on the\r\nmeans of enriching and aggrandizing themselves, than of enriching and\r\naggrandizing their country. Hence the war-worn veteran, whose re- [5]\r\nward for toils and wounds existed in written promises, found Congress\r\nwithout the means, and too many of the States without the disposition,\r\nto do him justice. Hard necessity compelled him, and others under\r\nsimilar circumstances, to sell their honest claims on the public for a\r\nlittle bread; and thus unmerited misfortunes and patriotic distresses\r\nbecame articles of speculation and commerce.\r\n\r\nThese and many other evils, too well known to require enumeration,\r\nimperceptibly stole in upon us, and acquired an unhappy influence on\r\nour public affairs. But such evils, like the worst of weeds, will\r\nnaturally spring up in so rich a soil; and a good Government is as\r\nnecessary to subdue the one, as an attentive gardener or husbandman\r\nis to destroy the other—Even the garden of Paradise required to be\r\ndressed, and while men continue to be constantly impelled to error and\r\nto wrong by innumerable circumstances and temptations, so long will\r\nsociety experience the unceasing necessity of government.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that the expectations which actuated the authors of the\r\nexisting confederation, neither have nor can be realized:—accustomed\r\nto see and admire the glorious spirit which moved all ranks of people\r\nin the most gloomy moments of the war, observing their steadfast\r\nattachment to Union, and the wisdom they so often manifested both in\r\nchoosing and confiding in their rulers, those gentlemen were led to\r\nflatter themselves that the people of America only required to know\r\nwhat ought to be done, to do it. This amiable mistake induced them to\r\ninstitute a national government in such a manner, as though very fit to\r\ngive advice, was yet destitute of power, and so constructed as to be\r\nvery unfit to be trusted with it. They seem not to have been sensible\r\nthat mere advice is a sad substitute for laws; nor to have recollected\r\nthat the advice even of the all-wise and best of Beings, has been always\r\ndisregarded by a great majority of all the men that ever lived.\r\n\r\nExperience is a severe preceptor, but it teaches useful truths, and\r\nhowever harsh, is always honest—Be calm and dispassionate, and listen\r\nto what it tells us.\r\n\r\nPrior to the revolution we had little occasion to inquire or know much\r\nabout national affairs, for although they existed and were managed, yet\r\nthey were managed _for_ us, but not _by_ us. Intent on our domestic\r\nconcerns, our internal legislative business, our agriculture, and our\r\nbuying and selling, we were seldom anxious about what passed or was [6]\r\ndoing in foreign Courts. As we had nothing to do with that department\r\nof policy, so the affairs of it were not detailed to us, and we took as\r\nlittle pains to inform ourselves, as others did to inform us of them.\r\nWar, and peace, alliances, and treaties, and commerce, and navigation,\r\nwere conducted and regulated without our advice or controul. While\r\nwe had liberty and justice, and in security enjoyed the fruits of\r\nour “vine and fig tree,” we were in general too content and too much\r\noccupied, to be at the trouble of investigating the various political\r\ncombinations in this department, or to examine and perceive how\r\nexceedingly important they often were to the advancement and protection\r\nof our prosperity. This habit and turn of thinking affords one reason\r\nwhy so much more care was taken, and so much more wisdom displayed, in\r\nforming our State Governments, than in forming our Federal or national\r\none.\r\n\r\nBy the Confederation as it now stands, the direction of general and\r\nnational affairs is committed to a single body of men, viz. the\r\nCongress. They may make war, but are not empowered to raise men or\r\nmoney to carry it on. They may make peace, but without power to\r\nsee the terms of it observed—They may form alliances, but without\r\nability to comply with the stipulations on their part—They may\r\nenter into treaties of commerce, but without power to enforce them\r\nat home or abroad—They may borrow money, but without having the\r\nmeans of repayment—They may partly regulate commerce, but without\r\nauthority to execute their ordinances—They may appoint ministers and\r\nother officers of trust, but without power to try or punish them for\r\nmisdemeanors—They may resolve, but cannot execute either with dispatch\r\nor with secrecy—In short, they may consult, and deliberate, and\r\nrecommend, and make requisitions, and they who please, may regard them.\r\n\r\nFrom this new and wonderful system of Government, it has come to\r\npass, that almost every national object of every kind, is at this\r\nday unprovided for; and other nations taking the advantage of its\r\nimbecility, are daily multiplying commercial restraints upon us. Our\r\nfur trade is gone to Canada, and British garrisons keep the keys of\r\nit. Our shipyards have almost ceased to disturb the repose of the\r\nneighborhood by the noise of the axe and hammer; and while foreign\r\nflags fly triumphantly above our highest houses, the American Stars\r\nseldom do more than shed a few feeble rays about the humble masts of\r\nriver sloops and coasting schooners. The greater part of our hardy\r\nseamen, are [7] plowing the ocean in foreign pay; and not a few of\r\nour ingenious shipwrights are now building vessels on alien shores.\r\nAlthough our increasing agriculture and industry extend and multiply\r\nour productions, yet they constantly diminish in value; and although\r\nwe permit all nations to fill our country with their merchandises,\r\nyet their best markets are shut against us. Is there an English, or\r\na French, or a Spanish island or port in the West-Indies, to which\r\nan American vessel can carry a cargo of flour for sale? Not one. The\r\nAlgerines exclude us from the Mediterranean, and adjacent countries;\r\nand we are neither able to purchase, nor to command the free use of\r\nthose seas. Can our little towns or larger cities consume the immense\r\nproductions of our fertile country? or will they without trade be able\r\nto pay a good price for the proportion which they do consume? The last\r\nseason gave a very unequivocal answer to these questions—What numbers\r\nof fine cattle have returned from this city to the country for want\r\nof buyers? What great quantities of salted and other provisions still\r\nlie useless in the stores? To how much below the former price, is our\r\ncorn, and wheat and flour and lumber rapidly falling? Our debts remain\r\nundiminished, and the interest on them accumulating—our credit abroad\r\nis nearly extinguished, and at home unrestored—they who had money have\r\nsent it beyond the reach of our laws, and scarcely any man can borrow\r\nof his neighbor. Nay, does not experience also tell us, that it is as\r\ndifficult to pay as to borrow? That even our houses and lands cannot\r\ncommand money—that law suits and usurious contracts abound—that\r\nour farms sell on executions for less than half their value, and that\r\ndistress in various forms, and in various ways, is approaching fast to\r\nthe doors of our best citizens.\r\n\r\nThese things have been gradually coming upon us ever since the\r\npeace—they have been perceived and proclaimed, but the universal\r\nrage and pursuit of private gain conspired with other causes, to\r\nprevent any proper efforts being made to meliorate our condition by\r\ndue attention to our national affairs, until the late Convention was\r\nconvened for that purpose. From the result of their deliberations, the\r\nStates expected to derive much good, and should they be disappointed,\r\nit will probably be not less their misfortune than their fault. That\r\nConvention was in general composed of excellent and tried men—men who\r\nhad become conspicuous for their wisdom and public services, and whose\r\nnames [8] and characters will be venerated by posterity. Generous and\r\ncandid minds cannot perceive without pain, the illiberal manner in\r\nwhich some have taken the liberty to treat them; nor forbear to impute\r\nit to impure and improper motives, zeal for public good, like zeal for\r\nreligion, may sometimes carry men beyond the bounds of reason, but it\r\nis not conceivable, that on this occasion, it should find means so to\r\ninebriate any _candid_ American, as to make him forget what he owed to\r\ntruth and to decency, or induce him either to believe or to say, that\r\nthe almost unanimous advice of the Convention, proceeded from a wicked\r\ncombination and conspiracy against the liberties of their country.\r\nThis is not the temper with which we should receive and consider\r\ntheir recommendations, nor the treatment that would be worthy either\r\nof us or them. Let us continue careful therefore that facts do not\r\nwarrant historians to tell future generations, that envy, malice and\r\nuncharitableness pursued our patriotic benefactors to their graves, and\r\nthat not even pre-eminence in virtue, nor lives devoted to the public,\r\ncould shield them from obloquy and detraction. On the contrary, let\r\nour bosoms always retain a sufficient degree of honest indignation to\r\ndisappoint and discourage those who expect our thanks or applause for\r\ncalumniating our most faithful and meritorious friends.\r\n\r\nThe Convention concurred in opinion with the people, that a national\r\ngovernment, _competent to every national object_, was indispensibly\r\nnecessary; and it was as plain to them, as it now is to all America,\r\nthat the present confederation does not provide for such a government.\r\nThese points being agreed, they proceeded to consider how and in what\r\nmanner such a government could be formed, as on the one hand, should be\r\nsufficiently energetic to raise us from our prostrate and distressed\r\nsituation, and on the other be perfectly consistent with the liberties\r\nof the people of every State. Like men to whom the experience of other\r\nages and countries had taught wisdom, they not only determined that\r\nit should be erected by, and depend on the people; but remembering\r\nthe many instances in which governments vested solely in one man, or\r\none body of men, had degenerated into tyrannies, they judged it most\r\nprudent that the three great branches of power should be committed to\r\ndifferent hands, and therefore that the executive should be separated\r\nfrom the legislative, and the judicial from both. Thus far the\r\npropriety of their work is easily seen and understood, and therefore is\r\nthus far _almost_ uni- [9] versally approved—for no one man or thing\r\nunder the sun ever yet pleased every body.\r\n\r\nThe next question was, what particular powers should be given to these\r\nthree branches? Here the different views and interests of the different\r\nstates, as well as the different abstract opinions of their members on\r\nsuch points, interposed many difficulties. Here the business became\r\ncomplicated, and presented a wide field for investigation; too wide for\r\nevery eye to take a quick and comprehensive view of it.\r\n\r\nIt is said that “in a multitude of counsellors there is safety,”\r\nbecause in the first place, there is greater security for probity; and\r\nin the next, if every member cast in only his mite of information and\r\nargument, their joint stock of both will thereby become greater than\r\nthe stock possessed by any one single man out of doors. Gentlemen out\r\nof doors therefore should not be hasty in condemning a system, which\r\nprobably rests on more good reasons than they are aware of, especially\r\nwhen formed under such advantages, and recommended by so many men of\r\ndistinguished worth and abilities.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties before mentioned occupied the Convention a long time\r\nand it was not without mutual concessions that they were at last\r\nsurmounted. These concessions serve to explain to us the reason why\r\nsome parts of the system please in some states, which displease in\r\nothers; and why many of the objections which have been made to it,\r\nare so contradictory and inconsistent with one another. It does great\r\ncredit to the temper and talents of the Convention, that they were able\r\nso to reconcile the different views and interests of the different\r\nStates, and the clashing opinions of their members as to unite with\r\nsuch singular and almost perfect unanimity in any plan whatever, on a\r\nsubject so intricate and perplexed. It shews that it must have been\r\nthoroughly discussed and understood; and probably if the community\r\nat large had the same lights and reasons before them, they would, if\r\nequally candid and uninfluenced, be equally unanimous.\r\n\r\nIt would be arduous, and indeed impossible, to comprise within the\r\nlimits of this address, a full discussion of every part of the plan.\r\nSuch a task would require a volume, and few men have leisure or\r\ninclination to read volumes on any subject. The objections made to\r\nit are almost without number, and many of them without reason—some\r\nof them are real and honest, and others merely ostensible. There are\r\nfriends to [10] Union and a national Government who have serious\r\ndoubts, who wish to be informed, and to be convinced; and there are\r\nothers who, neither wishing for union, nor any national Government at\r\nall, will oppose and object to any plan that can be contrived.\r\n\r\nWe are told, among other strange things, that the liberty of the\r\npress is left insecure by the proposed Constitution, and yet that\r\nConstitution says neither more nor less about it, than the Constitution\r\nof the State of New York does. We are told that it deprives us of trial\r\nby jury, whereas the fact is, that it expressly secures it in certain\r\ncases, and takes it away in none—it is absurd to construe the silence\r\nof this, or of our own constitution, relative to a great number of\r\nour rights, into a total extinction of them—silence and blank paper\r\nneither grant nor take away anything. Complaints are also made that\r\nthe proposed constitution is not accompanied by a bill of rights;\r\nand yet they who would make these complaints, know and are content\r\nthat no bill of rights accompanied the Constitution of this State. In\r\ndays and countries, where Monarchs and their subjects were frequently\r\ndisputing about prerogative and privileges, the latter often found it\r\nnecessary, as it were to run out the line between them, and oblige the\r\nformer to admit by solemn acts, called bills of rights, that certain\r\nenumerated rights belonged to the people, and were not comprehended in\r\nthe royal prerogative. But thank God we have no such disputes—we have\r\nno Monarchs to contend with, or demand admission from—the proposed\r\nGovernment is to be the government of the people—all its officers are\r\nto be their officers, and to exercise no rights but such as the people\r\ncommit to them. The Constitution only serves to point out that part\r\nof the people’s business, which they think proper by it to refer to\r\nthe management of the persons therein designated—those persons are to\r\nreceive that business to manage, not for themselves and as their own,\r\nbut as agents and overseers for the people to whom they are constantly\r\nresponsible, and by whom only they are to be appointed.\r\n\r\nBut the design of this address is not to investigate the merits of\r\nthe plan, nor of the objections to it. They who seriously contemplate\r\nthe present state of our affairs will be convinced that other\r\nconsiderations of at least equal importance demand their attention. Let\r\nit be admitted that this plan, like everything else devised by man, has\r\nits imperfections: That it does not please every body is certain and\r\nthere is little [11] reason to expect one that will. It is a question\r\nof great moment to you, whether the probability of your being able\r\nseasonably to obtain a better, is such as to render it prudent and\r\nadvisable to reject this, and run the risque. Candidly to consider this\r\nquestion is the design of this address.\r\n\r\nAs the importance of this question must be obvious to every man,\r\nwhatever his private opinions respecting it may be, it becomes us all\r\nto treat it in that calm and temperate manner, which a subject so\r\ndeeply interesting to the future welfare of our country and prosperity\r\nrequires. Let us therefore as much as possible repress and compose\r\nthat irritation in our minds, which to warm disputes about it may\r\nhave excited. Let us endeavour to forget that this or that man, is on\r\nthis or that side; and that we ourselves, perhaps without sufficient\r\nreflection, have classed ourselves with one or the other party. Let\r\nus remember that this is not a matter to be regarded as a matter that\r\nonly touches our local parties, but as one so great, so general, and so\r\nextensive in its future consequences to America, that for our deciding\r\nupon it according to the best of our unbiassed judgment, we must be\r\nhighly responsible both here and hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe question now before us now naturally leads to _three_ enquiries:\r\n\r\n1. Whether it is probable that a better plan can be obtained?\r\n\r\n2. Whether, if attainable, it is likely to be in season?\r\n\r\n3. What would be our situation, if after rejecting this, all our\r\nefforts to obtain a better should prove fruitless?\r\n\r\nThe men, who formed this plan are Americans, who had long deserved\r\nand enjoyed our confidence, and who are as much interested in having\r\na good government as any of us are, or can be. They were appointed\r\nto that business at a time when the States had become very sensible\r\nof the derangement of our national affairs, and of the impossibility\r\nof retrieving them under the existing Confederation. Although well\r\npersuaded that nothing but a good national government could oppose\r\nand divert the tide of evils that was flowing in upon us, yet those\r\ngentlemen met in Convention with minds perfectly unprejudiced in\r\nfavour of any particular plan. The minds of their Constituents were\r\nat that time equally unbiased, cool and dispassionate. All agreed in\r\nthe necessity of doing something, but no one ventured to say decidedly\r\nwhat precisely ought to be done—opinions were then fluctuating and\r\nunfixed, and whatever might have been the wishes of a few individuals,\r\nyet while the Convention deliberated, the people remained in [12]\r\nsilent suspence. Neither wedded to favourite systems of their own, nor\r\ninfluenced by popular ones abroad, the members were more desirous to\r\nreceive light from, than to impress their private sentiments on, one\r\nanother. These circumstances naturally opened the door to that spirit\r\nof candour, of calm enquiry, of mutual accommodation, and mutual\r\nrespect, which entered into the Convention with them, and regulated\r\ntheir debates and proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of agreeing upon any plan that would exactly quadrate\r\nwith the local policy and objects of every State, soon became evident;\r\nand they wisely thought it better mutually to concede, and accommodate,\r\nand in that way to fashion their system as much as possible by the\r\ncircumstances and wishes of different States, than by pertinaciously\r\nadhering, each to his own ideas, oblige the Convention to rise without\r\ndoing anything. They were sensible that obstacles arising from local\r\ncircumstances, would not cease while those circumstances continued to\r\nexist; and so far as those circumstances depended on differences of\r\nclimate, productions, and commerce, that no change was to be expected.\r\nThey were likewise sensible that on a subject so comprehensive, and\r\ninvolving such a variety of points and questions, the most able, the\r\nmost candid, and the most honest men will differ in opinion. The same\r\nproposition seldom strikes many minds exactly in the same point of\r\nlight; different habits of thinking, different degrees and modes of\r\neducation, different prejudices and opinions early formed and long\r\nentertained, conspire with a multitude of other circumstances, to\r\nproduce among men a diversity and contrariety of opinions on questions\r\nof difficulty. Liberality therefore as well as prudence, induced them\r\nto treat each other’s opinions with tenderness, to argue without\r\nasperity, and to endeavor to convince the judgment without hurting\r\nthe feelings of each other. Although many weeks were passed in these\r\ndiscussions, some points remained, on which a unison of opinions could\r\nnot be effected. Here again that same happy disposition to unite and\r\nconciliate, induced them to meet each other; and enabled them, by\r\nmutual concessions, finally to complete and agree to the plan they have\r\nrecommended, and that too with a degree of unanimity which, considering\r\nthe variety of discordant views and ideas, they had to reconcile, is\r\nreally astonishing.\r\n\r\nThey tell us very honestly that this plan is the result of\r\naccommodation—they do not hold it up as the best of all possible ones,\r\nbut only as [13] the best which they could unite in, and agree to. If\r\nsuch men, appointed and meeting under such auspicious circumstances,\r\nand so sincerely disposed to conciliation, could go no further in their\r\nendeavors to please every State, and every body, what reason have we at\r\npresent to expect any system that would give more general satisfaction?\r\n\r\nSuppose this plan to be rejected, what measures would you propose\r\nfor obtaining a better? Some will answer, let us appoint another\r\nConvention, and as everything has been said and written that can well\r\nbe said and written on the subject, they will be better informed than\r\nthe former one was, and consequently be better able to make and agree\r\nupon a more eligible one.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is fair, and as far as it goes has weight; but it\r\nnevertheless takes one thing for granted, which appears very doubtful;\r\nfor although the new Convention might have more information, and\r\nperhaps equal abilities, yet it does not from thence follow that they\r\nwould be equally _disposed to agree_. The contrary of this position\r\nis the most probable. You must have observed that the same temper and\r\nequanimity which prevailed among the people on the former occasion,\r\nno longer exists. We have unhappily become divided into parties; and\r\nthis important subject has been handled with such indiscreet and\r\noffensive acrimony, and with so many little unhandsome artifices and\r\nmisrepresentations, that pernicious heats and animosities have been\r\nkindled, and spread their flames far and wide among us. When therefore\r\nit becomes a question who shall be deputed to the new Convention;\r\nwe cannot flatter ourselves that the talents and integrity of the\r\ncandidates will determine who shall be elected. Federal electors\r\nwill vote for Foederal deputies, and anti-Foederal electors for\r\nanti-Foederal ones. Nor will either party prefer the most moderate\r\nof their adherents, for as the most staunch and active partizans\r\nwill be the most popular, so the men most willing and able to carry\r\npoints, to oppose, and divide, and embarrass their opponents, will be\r\nchosen. A Convention formed at such a season, and of such men, would be\r\nbut too exact an epitome of the great body that named them. The same\r\nparty views, the same propensity to opposition, the same distrusts and\r\njealousies, and the same unaccommodating spirit which prevail without,\r\nwould be concentred and ferment with still greater violence within.\r\nEach deputy would recollect _who_ sent [14] him, and _why_ he was sent;\r\nand be too apt to consider himself bound in honor, to contend and\r\nact vigorously under the standard of his party, and not hazard their\r\ndispleasure by prefering compromise to victory. As vice does not sow\r\nthe seeds of virtue, so neither does passion cultivate the fruits of\r\nreason. Suspicions and resentments create no disposition to conciliate,\r\nnor do they infuse a desire of making partial and personal objects\r\nbend to general union and the common good. The utmost efforts of that\r\nexcellent disposition were necessary to enable the late Convention to\r\nperform their task; and although contrary causes sometimes operate\r\nsimilar effects, yet to expect that discord and animosity should\r\nproduce the fruits of confidence and agreement, is to expect “grapes\r\nfrom thorns, and figs from thistles.”\r\n\r\nThe States of Georgia, Delaware, Jersey, and Connecticut, have adopted\r\nthe present plan with unexampled unanimity; they are content with\r\nit as it is, and consequently their deputies, being apprized of the\r\nsentiments of their Constituents, will be little inclined to make\r\nalterations, and cannot be otherwise than averse to changes which they\r\nhave no reason to think would be agreeable to their people—some other\r\nStates, tho’ less unanimous, have nevertheless adopted it by very\r\nrespectable majorities; and for reasons so evidently cogent, that even\r\nthe minority in one of them, have nobly pledged themselves for its\r\npromotion and support. From these circumstances, the new Convention\r\nwould derive and experience difficulties unknown to the former. Nor are\r\nthese the only additional difficulties they would have to encounter.\r\nFew are ignorant that there has lately sprung up a sect of politicians\r\nwho teach and profess to believe that the extent of our nation is too\r\ngreat for the superintendance of one national Government, and on that\r\nprinciple argue that it ought to be divided into two or three. This\r\ndoctrine, however mischievous in its tendency and consequences, has its\r\nadvocates; and, should any of them be sent to the Convention, it will\r\nnaturally be their policy rather to cherish than to prevent divisions;\r\nfor well knowing that the institution of any national Government, would\r\nblast their favourite system, no measures that lead to it can meet with\r\ntheir aid or approbation.\r\n\r\nNor can we be certain whether or not any and what foreign influence\r\nwould, on such an occasion, be indirectly exerted, nor for what\r\npurposes—delicacy forbids an ample discussion of this question. Thus\r\nmuch [15] may be said, without error or offence, viz. That such foreign\r\nnations as desire the prosperity of America, and would rejoice to see\r\nher become great and powerful, under the auspices of a Government\r\nwisely calculated to extend her commerce, to encourage her navigation\r\nand marine, and to direct the whole weight of her power and resources\r\nas her interest and honour may require, will doubtless be friendly to\r\nthe Union of the States, and to the establishment of a Government able\r\nto perpetuate, protect and dignify it. Such other foreign nations, if\r\nany such their be, who, jealous of our growing importance, and fearful\r\nthat our commerce and navigation should impair their own—who behold\r\nour rapid population with regret, and apprehend that the enterprising\r\nspirit of our people, when seconded by power and probability of\r\nsuccess, may be directed to objects not consistent with their policy\r\nor interests, cannot fail to wish that we may continue a weak and a\r\ndivided people.\r\n\r\nThese considerations merit much attention, and candid men will judge\r\nhow far they render it probable that a new Convention would be able\r\neither to agree in a better plan, or with tolerable unanimity, in any\r\nplan at all. Any plan forcibly carried by a slender majority, must\r\nexpect numerous opponents among the people, who, especially in their\r\npresent temper, would be more inclined to reject than adopt any system\r\nso made and carried. We should in such case again see the press teeming\r\nwith publications for and against it; for as the minority would take\r\npains to justify their dissent, so would the majority be industrious\r\nto display the wisdom of their proceedings. Hence new divisions, new\r\nparties, and new distractions would ensue, and no one can foresee or\r\nconjecture when or how they would terminate.\r\n\r\nLet those who are sanguine in their expectations of a better plan from\r\na new Convention, also reflect on the delays and risque to which it\r\nwould expose us. Let them consider whether we ought, by continuing\r\nmuch longer in our present humiliated condition, to give other nations\r\nfurther time to perfect their restrictive systems of commerce, to\r\nreconcile their own people to them, and to fence and guard and\r\nstrengthen them by all those regulations and contrivances in which a\r\njealous policy is ever fruitful. Let them consider whether we ought to\r\ngive further opportunities to discord to alienate the hearts of our\r\ncitizens from one another, and thereby encourage new Cromwells to bold\r\nexploits. Are we cer- [16] tain that our foreign creditors will continue\r\npatient, and ready to proportion their forbearance to our delays? Are\r\nwe sure that our distresses, dissentions and weakness will neither\r\ninvite hostility nor insult? If they should, how ill prepared shall we\r\nbe for defence! without Union, without Government, without money, and\r\nwithout credit!\r\n\r\nIt seems necessary to remind you, that some time must yet elapse,\r\nbefore all the States will have decided on the present plan. If they\r\nreject it, some time must also pass before the measure of a new\r\nConvention, can be brought about and generally agreed to. A further\r\nspace of time will then be requisite to elect their deputies, and send\r\nthem on to Convention. What time they may expend when met, cannot be\r\ndivined, and it is equally uncertain how much time the several States\r\nmay take to deliberate and decide on any plan they may recommend—if\r\nadopted, still a further space of time will be necessary to organize\r\nand set it in motion:—In the mean time our affairs are daily going on\r\nfrom bad to worse, and it is not rash to say that our distresses are\r\naccumulating like compound interest.\r\n\r\nBut if for the reasons already mentioned, and others that we cannot\r\nnow perceive, the new Convention, instead of producing a better plan,\r\nshould give us only a history of their disputes, or should offer us\r\none still less pleasing than the present, where should we be then? The\r\nold Confederation has done its best, and cannot help us; and is now\r\nso relaxed and feeble, that in all probability it would not survive\r\nso violent a shock. Then “to your tents Oh Israel!” would be the word.\r\nThen every band of union would be severed. Then every State would be\r\na little nation, jealous of its neighbors, and anxious to strengthen\r\nitself by foreign alliances, against its former friends. Then\r\nfarewell to fraternal affection, unsuspecting intercourse; and mutual\r\nparticipation in commerce, navigation and citizenship. Then would arise\r\nmutual restrictions and fears, mutual garrisons,—and standing armies,\r\nand all those dreadful evils which for so many ages plagued England,\r\nScotland, Wales, and Ireland, while they continued disunited, and were\r\nplayed off against each other.\r\n\r\nConsider my fellow citizens what you are about, before it is too\r\nlate—consider what in such an event would be your particular case. You\r\nknow the geography of your State, and the consequences of your local\r\nposition. Jersey and Connecticut, to whom your impost laws have been\r\n[17] unkind—Jersey and Connecticut, who have adopted the present plan,\r\nand expect much good from it—will impute its miscarriage and all the\r\nconsequent evils to you. They now consider your opposition as dictated\r\nmore by your fondness for your impost, than for those rights to which\r\nthey have never been behind you in attachment. They cannot, they will\r\nnot love you—they border upon you, and are your neighbors; but you\r\nwill soon cease to regard their neighborhood as a blessing. You have\r\nbut one port and outlet to your commerce, and how you are to keep that\r\noutlet free and uninterrupted, merits consideration.—What advantage\r\nVermont in combination with others, might take of you, may easily be\r\nconjectured; nor will you be at a loss to perceive how much reason the\r\npeople of Long Island, whom you cannot protect, have to deprecate being\r\nconstantly exposed to the depredations of every invader.\r\n\r\nThese are short hints—they ought not to be more developed—you\r\ncan easily in your own mind dilate and trace them through all their\r\nrelative circumstances and connections.—Pause then for a moment, and\r\nreflect whether the matters you are disputing about, are of sufficient\r\nmoment to justify your running such extravagant risques. Reflect that\r\nthe present plan comes recommended to you by men and fellow citizens\r\nwho have given you the highest proofs that men can give, of their\r\njustice, their love for liberty and their country, of their prudence,\r\nof their application, and of their talents. They tell you it is the\r\nbest that they could form; and that in their opinion, it is necessary\r\nto redeem you from those calamities which already begin to be heavy\r\nupon us all. You find that not only those men, but others of similar\r\ncharacters, and of whom you have also had very ample experience, advise\r\nyou to adopt it. You find that whole States concur in the sentiment,\r\nand among them are your next neighbors; both whom have shed much blood\r\nin the cause of liberty, and have manifested as strong and constant\r\na predilection for a free Republican Government as any State in the\r\nUnion, and perhaps in the world. They perceive not those latent\r\nmischiefs in it, with which some double-sighted politicians endeavor to\r\nalarm you. You cannot but be sensible that this plan or constitution\r\nwill always be in the hands and power of the people, and that [18]\r\nif on experiment, it should be found defective or incompetent, they\r\nmay either remedy its defects, or substitute another in its room.\r\nThe objectionable parts of it are certainly very questionable, for\r\notherwise there would not be such a contrariety of opinions about\r\nthem. Experience will better determine such questions than theoretical\r\narguments, and so far as the danger of abuses is urged against the\r\ninstitution of a Government, remember that a power to do good, always\r\ninvolves a power to do harm. We must in the business of Government\r\nas well as in all other business, have some degree of confidence, as\r\nwell as a great degree of caution. Who on a sick bed would refuse\r\nmedicines from a physician, merely because it is as much in his power\r\nto administer deadly poisons, as salutary remedies.\r\n\r\nYou cannot be certain, that by rejecting the proposed plan you would\r\nnot place yourself in a very awkward situation. Suppose nine States\r\nshould nevertheless adopt it, would you not in that case be obliged\r\neither to separate from the Union, or rescind your dissent? The first\r\nwould not be eligible, nor could the latter be pleasant—A mere hint is\r\nsufficient on this topic—You cannot but be aware of the consequences.\r\n\r\nConsider then, how weighty and how many considerations advise and\r\npersuade the people of America to remain in the safe and easy path\r\nof Union; to continue to move and act as they hitherto have done, as\r\na _band of brothers_; to have confidence in themselves and in one\r\nanother; and since all cannot see with the same eyes, at least to\r\ngive the proposed Constitution a fair trial, and to mend it as time,\r\noccasion and experience may dictate. It would little become us to\r\nverify the predictions of those who ventured to prophecy, that _peace_:\r\ninstead of blessing us with happiness and tranquility, would serve only\r\nas the signal for factions, discords and civil contentions to rage in\r\nour land, and overwhelm it with misery and distress.\r\n\r\nLet us also be mindful that the cause of freedom greatly depends on\r\nthe use we make of the singular opportunities we enjoy of governing\r\nourselves wisely; for if the event should prove, that the people of\r\nthis [19] country either cannot or will not govern themselves, who\r\nwill hereafter be advocates for systems, which however charming in\r\ntheory and prospect, are not reducible to practice. If the people of\r\nour nation, instead of consenting to be governed by laws of their own\r\nmaking, and rulers of their own choosing, should let licentiousness,\r\ndisorder, and confusion reign over them, the minds of men every where,\r\nwill insensibly become alienated from republican forms, and prepared\r\nto prefer and acquiesce in Governments, which, though less friendly to\r\nliberty, afford more peace and security.\r\n\r\n_Receive this Address with the same candor with which it is written;\r\nand may the spirit of wisdom and patriotism direct and distinguish your\r\ncouncils and your conduct._\r\n\r\n  _A citizen of New York._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn / Address / to the / People / of the / State of New-York: / Showing\r\nthe necessity of making / Amendments / to the / Constitution, proposed\r\nfor the United States, / previous to its Adoption. / By a Plebeian. /\r\nPrinted in the State of New York; / M,DCC,LXXX,VIII.\r\n\r\n  8vo., pp. 26.\r\n\r\n  Written by Melancthon Smith of New York, a member of the Continental\r\n  Congress, (1785-88), and of the New York State Convention, in which\r\n  he opposed, but ultimately voted for the ratification of the new\r\n  Constitution.\r\n\r\n  “This address begins with several assertions that are not\r\n  fully proved. It declares that ‘the advocates for the proposed\r\n  constitution, having been beaten off the field of argument, on its\r\n  merits, have taken new ground—admit that it is liable to well founded\r\n  objections—that a number of its articles ought to be amended—that\r\n  if alterations do not take place a door will be left open for an\r\n  undue administration, and encroachments on the liberties of the\r\n  people—and many of them go so far as to say, if it should continue\r\n  for any considerable period, in its present form, it will lead to a\r\n  subversion of our equal republican forms of government.’\r\n\r\n  “These assertions, it is presumed are too general to be true. _Some_\r\n  friends (upon the whole) to the proposed government, may have\r\n  acknowledged all this; but the _most enlightened ones_ declare that,\r\n  in their opinion, the constitution is as little defective as can ever\r\n  be obtained—that it is _not liable to well founded objections_—that\r\n  it will _preserve_ our equal republican forms of government; nay,\r\n  that it is their only firm support, and the guarantee of their\r\n  existence—and if they consent to the additions and alterations\r\n  proposed by the Massachusetts Convention, it is not so much because\r\n  they think the constitution will be _better_ for them; but because\r\n  they think these additions will reconcile the opposition and unite\r\n  all parties in a desirable harmony, without making the constitution\r\n  _worse_.\r\n\r\n  “The writer, to show the happy situation of the citizens of this\r\n  State, enquires, ‘_Does not every man sit under his own vine and\r\n  his own fig tree?_’ Yes, it may be answered, and under the rich\r\n  vines and fig trees of his neighbors too, ‘_having none to make him\r\n  afraid?_’ This was probably written before the late riot: And if the\r\n  inhabitants of this State are not afraid of their neighbors, whose\r\n  _vines and fig trees_ they are enjoying, they must be very ignorant\r\n  or very insensible.\r\n\r\n  “‘_Does not every one follow his own calling without impediment\r\n  and receive the reward of his well earned industry? The farmer and\r\n  mechanic reap the fruits of their labor. The merchant drives his\r\n  commerce and none can deprive him of the gain he honestly acquires._’\r\n  Had the last assertion been mere queries, the writer might have\r\n  saved his reputation. While the _war-worn veteran_ is paid for his\r\n  services, at a fourth or fifth of their value; while numbers of\r\n  mechanics have no employment; while commerce is restricted abroad,\r\n  and tender laws and depreciated paper money exist at home, the public\r\n  will not be disposed to believe themselves very happy—no, not even in\r\n  this State. In other States, where riots and rebellion have violated\r\n  private property, disturbed government and end in bloodshed, the\r\n  inhabitants will be more incredulous, and wish for the adoption of\r\n  the proposed constitution.”—[Noah Webster] in _American Magazine_ for\r\n  April, 1788.\r\n\r\n  P. L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friends and Fellow Citizens_,\r\n\r\nThe advocates for the proposed new constitution, having been beaten off\r\nthe field of argument, on its merits, have now taken new ground. They\r\nadmit it is liable to well-founded objections—that a number of its\r\narticles ought to be amended; that if alterations do not take place, a\r\ndoor will be left open for an undue administration, and encroachments\r\non the liberties of the people; and many of them go so far as to say,\r\nif it should continue for any considerable period, in its present\r\nform, it will lead to a subversion of our equal republican forms of\r\ngovernment.——But still, although they admit this, they urge that\r\nit ought to be adopted, and that we should confide in procuring the\r\nnecessary alterations after we have received it. Most of the leading\r\ncharacters, who advocate its reception, now profess their readiness\r\nto concur with those who oppose, in bringing about the most material\r\namendments contended for, provided they will first agree to accept the\r\nproffered system as it is. These concessions afford strong evidence,\r\nthat the opposers of the constitution have reason on their side, and\r\nthat they have not been influenced, in the part they have taken,\r\nby the mean and unworthy motives of selfish and private interests\r\nwith which they have been illiberally charged.—As the favourers of\r\nthe constitution seem, if their professions are sincere, to be in a\r\nsituation similar to that of Agrippa, when he cried out upon Paul’s\r\npreaching—“almost thou persuadest me to be a christian,” I cannot\r\nhelp indulging myself in expressing the same wish which St. Paul\r\nuttered on that occasion, “Would to God you were not only almost,\r\nbut altogether such an one as I am.” But alas, as we hear no more of\r\nAgrippa’s christianity after this interview with Paul, so it is much\r\nto [4] be feared, that we shall hear nothing of amendments from most\r\nof the warm advocates for adopting the new government, after it gets\r\ninto operation. When the government is once organized, and all the\r\noffices under it filled, the inducements which our great men will\r\nhave to support it, will be much stronger than they are now to urge\r\nits reception. Many of them will then hold places of great honour and\r\nemolument, and others will then be candidates for such places. It is\r\nmuch harder to relinquish honours or emoluments, which we have in\r\npossession, than to abandon the pursuit of them, while the attainment\r\nis held in a state of uncertainty.—The amendments contended for as\r\nnecessary to be made, are of such a nature, as will tend to limit and\r\nabridge a number of the powers of the government. And is it probable,\r\nthat those who enjoy these powers will be so likely to surrender\r\nthem after they have them in possession, as to consent to have them\r\nrestricted in the act of granting them? Common sense says—they will\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the nature and operation of government, the idea of\r\nreceiving a form radically defective, under the notion of making the\r\nnecessary amendments, is evidently absurd.\r\n\r\nGovernment is a compact entered into by mankind, in a state of society,\r\nfor the promotion of their happiness. In forming this compact, common\r\nsense dictates, that no articles should be admitted that tend to defeat\r\nthe end of its institution. If any such are proposed, they should be\r\nrejected. When the compact is once formed and put into operation,\r\nit is too late for individuals to object. The deed is executed—the\r\nconveyance is made—and the power of reassuming the right is gone,\r\nwithout the consent of the parties.——Besides, when a government is\r\nonce in operation, it acquires strength by habit, and stability by\r\nexercise. If it is tolerably mild in its administration, the people sit\r\ndown easy under it, be its principles and forms ever so repugnant to\r\nthe maxims of liberty.——It steals, by insensible degrees, one right\r\nfrom the people after another, until it rivets its powers so as to put\r\nit beyond the ability of the community to restrict or limit it. The\r\nhistory of the world furnishes many instances of a people’s increasing\r\nthe powers of their rulers by persuasion, but I believe it would be\r\ndifficult to produce one in which the rulers have been persuaded to\r\nrelinquish their powers to [5] the people. Wherever this has taken\r\nplace, it has always been the effect of compulsion. These observations\r\nare so well-founded, that they are become a kind of axioms in politics;\r\nand the inference to be drawn from them is equally evident, which is\r\nthis,—that, in forming a government, care should be taken not to\r\nconfer powers which it will be necessary to take back; but if you err\r\nat all, let it be on the contrary side, because it is much easier, as\r\nwell as safer, to enlarge the powers of your rulers, if they should\r\nprove not sufficiently extensive, than it is too abridge them if they\r\nshould be too great.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed, the plan is defective—that some of the powers granted,\r\nare dangerous—others not well defined—and amendments are necessary.\r\nWhy then not amend it? why not remove the cause of danger, and, if\r\npossible, even the apprehension of it? The instrument is yet in the\r\nhands of the people; it is not signed, sealed, and delivered, and they\r\nhave power to give it any form they please.\r\n\r\nBut it is contended, adopt it first, and then amend it. I ask, why not\r\namend, and then adopt it? Most certainly the latter mode of proceeding\r\nis more consistent with our ideas of prudence in the ordinary concerns\r\nof life. If men were about entering into a contract respecting their\r\nprivate concerns, it would be highly absurd in them to sign and seal\r\nan instrument containing stipulations which are contrary to their\r\ninterests and wishes, under the expectation, that the parties, after\r\nits execution, would agree to make alterations agreeable to their\r\ndesire.——They would insist upon the exceptionable clauses being\r\naltered before they would ratify the contract. And is a compact for\r\nthe government of ourselves and our posterity of less moment than\r\ncontracts between individuals? certainly not. But to this reasoning,\r\nwhich at first view would appear to admit of no reply, a variety of\r\nobjections are made, and a number of reasons urged for adopting the\r\nsystem, and afterwards proposing amendments.—Such as have come under\r\nmy observation, I shall state, and remark upon.\r\n\r\nI. It is insisted, that the present situation of our country is such,\r\nas not to admit of a delay in forming a new government, or of time\r\nsufficient to deliberate and agree upon the amendments which are\r\nproper, without involving ourselves in a state of anarchy and confusion.\r\n\r\n[6] On this head, all the powers of rhetoric, and arts of description,\r\nare employed to paint the condition of this country, in the most\r\nhideous and frightful colors. We are told, that agriculture is\r\nwithout encouragement; trade is languishing; private faith and credit\r\nare disregarded, and public credit is prostrate; that the laws\r\nand magistrates are contemned and set at naught; that a spirit of\r\nlicentiousness is rampant, and ready to break over every bound set\r\nto it by the government; that private embarrassments and distresses\r\ninvade the house of every man of middling property, and insecurity\r\nthreatens every man in affluent circumstances: in short, that we are\r\nin a state of the most grievous calamity at home, and that we are\r\ncontemptible abroad, the scorn of foreign nations, and the ridicule\r\nof the world. From this high-wrought picture, one would suppose that\r\nwe were in a condition the most deplorable of any people upon earth.\r\nBut suffer me, my countrymen, to call your attention to a serious\r\nand sober estimate of the situation in which you are placed, while I\r\ntrace the embarrassments under which you labor, to their true sources.\r\nWhat is your condition? Does not every man sit under his own vine and\r\nunder his own fig-tree, having none to make him afraid? Does not every\r\none follow his calling without impediments and receive the reward of\r\nhis well-earned industry? The farmer cultivates his land, and reaps\r\nthe fruit which the bounty of heaven bestows on his honest toil. The\r\nmechanic is exercised in his art, and receives the reward of his\r\nlabour. The merchant drives his commerce, and none can deprive him of\r\nthe gain he honestly acquires; all classes and callings of men amongst\r\nus are protected in their various pursuits, and secured by the laws\r\nin the possession and enjoyment of the property obtained in those\r\npursuits. The laws are as well executed as they ever were, in this or\r\nany other country. Neither the hand of private violence, nor the more\r\nto be dreaded hand of legal oppression, are reached out to distress us.\r\n\r\nIt is true, many individuals labour under embarrassments, but these are\r\nto be imputed to the unavoidable circumstances of things, rather than\r\nto any defect in our governments. We have just emerged from a long and\r\nexpensive war. During its existence few people were in a situation to\r\nincrease their fortunes, but many to diminish them. Debts contracted\r\nbefore the war were left unpaid [7] while it existed, and these were\r\nleft a burden too heavy to be borne at the commencement of peace.\r\nAdd to these, that when the war was over, too many of us, instead of\r\nreassuming our old habits of frugality, and industry, by which alone\r\nevery country must be placed in a prosperous condition, took up the\r\nprofuse use of foreign commodities. The country was deluged with\r\narticles imported from abroad, and the cash of the country has been\r\nsent to pay for them, and still left us labouring under the weight of a\r\nhuge debt to persons abroad. These are the true sources to which we are\r\nto trace all the private difficulties of individuals: But will a new\r\ngovernment relieve you from these? The advocates for it have not yet\r\ntold you how it will do it—And I will venture to pronounce, that there\r\nis but one way in which it can be effected, and that is by industry and\r\neconomy; limit your expences within your earnings; sell more than you\r\nbuy, and everything will be well on this score. Your present condition\r\nis such as is common to take place after the conclusion of a war.\r\nThose who can remember our situation after the termination of the war\r\npreceding the last, will recollect that our condition was similar to\r\nthe present, but time and industry soon recovered us from it. Money was\r\nscare, the produce of the country much lower than it has been since the\r\npeace, and many individuals were extremely embarrassed with debts; and\r\nthis happened although we did not experience the ravages, desolations,\r\nand loss of property, that were suffered during the late war.\r\n\r\nWith regard to our public and national concerns, what is there in our\r\ncondition that threatens us with any immediate danger? We are at peace\r\nwith all the world; no nation menaces us with war; nor are we called\r\nupon by any cause of sufficient importance to attack any nation. The\r\nstate governments answer the purposes of preserving the peace, and\r\nproviding for present exigencies. Our condition as a nation is in no\r\nrespect worse than it has been for several years past. Our public debt\r\nhas been lessened in various ways, and the western territory, which has\r\nbeen relied upon as a productive fund to discharge the national debt\r\nhas at length been brought to market, and a considerable part actually\r\napplied to its reduction. I mention these things to shew, that there is\r\nnothing special, in our present situation, as it respects our national\r\naffairs, that should induce us to accept the prof- [8] fered system,\r\nwithout taking sufficient time to consider and amend it. I do not mean\r\nby this, to insinuate, that our government does not stand in need of a\r\nreform. It is admitted by all parties, that alterations are necessary\r\nin our federal constitution, but the circumstances of our case do by\r\nno means oblige us to precipitate this business, or require that we\r\nshould adopt a system materially defective. We may safely take time to\r\ndeliberate and amend, without in the meantime hazarding a condition, in\r\nany considerable degree, worse than the present.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that if we postpone the ratification of this system\r\nuntil the necessary amendments are first incorporated, the consequence\r\nwill be a civil war among the states. On this head weak minds\r\nare alarmed with being told, that the militia of Connecticut and\r\nMassachusetts, on the one side, and of New Jersey and Pennsylvania on\r\nthe other, will attack us with hostile fury; and either destroy us from\r\nthe face of the earth, or at best divide us between the two states\r\nadjoining on either side. The apprehension of danger is one of the\r\nmost powerful incentives to human action, and is therefore generally\r\nexcited on political questions: But still, a prudent man, though he\r\nforeseeth the evil and avoideth it, yet he will not be terrified by\r\nimaginary dangers. We ought therefore to enquire what ground there is\r\nto fear such an event?—There can be no reason to apprehend, that the\r\nother states will make war with us for not receiving the constitution\r\nproposed, until it is amended, but from one of the following causes:\r\neither that they will have just cause to do it, or that they have a\r\ndisposition to do it. We will examine each of these:—That they will\r\nhave no just cause to quarrel with us for not acceding, is evident,\r\nbecause we are under no obligation to do it, arising from any existing\r\ncompact or previous stipulation. The confederation is the only compact\r\nnow existing between the states: By the terms of it, it cannot be\r\nchanged without the consent of every one of the parties to it. Nothing\r\ntherefore can be more unreasonable than for part of the states to claim\r\nof the others, as matter of right, an accession to a system to which\r\nthey have material objections. No war can therefore arise from this\r\nprinciple, but on the contrary, it is to be presumed, it will operate\r\nstrongly the opposite way.—The states will reason on the subject in\r\nthe following manner: On this momentous question, every state has an\r\nin- [9] dubitable right to judge for itself: This is secured to it by\r\nsolemn compact, and if any of our sister states disagree with us upon\r\nthe question, we ought to attend to their objections, and accommodate\r\nourselves as far as possible to the amendments they propose.\r\n\r\nAs to the inclination of the states to make war with us, for declining\r\nto accede, until it is amended, this is highly improbable, not only\r\nbecause such a procedure would be most unjust and unreasonable in\r\nitself, but for various other reasons.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a civil war among the states is abhorrent to the principles\r\nand feelings of almost every man of every rank in the union. It is so\r\nobvious to every one of the least reflection, that in such an event\r\nwe should hazard the loss of all things, without the hope of gaining\r\nanything, that the man who should entertain a thought of this kind,\r\nwould be justly deemed more fit to be shut up in Bedlam, than to be\r\nreasoned with. But the idea of one or more states attacking another,\r\nfor insisting upon alterations upon the system, before it is adopted,\r\nis more extravagent still; it is contradicting every principle of\r\nliberty which has been entertained by the states, violating the most\r\nsolemn compact, and taking from the state the right of deliberation.\r\nIndeed to suppose, that a people, entertaining such refined ideas\r\nof the rights of human nature as to be induced to wage war with the\r\nmost powerful nation on earth, upon a speculative point, and from the\r\nmere apprehension of danger only, should be so far lost to their\r\nown feelings and principles as to deny to their brethren, who were\r\nassociated with them in the arduous conflict, the right of deliberation\r\non a question of the first importance to their political happiness and\r\nsafety, is equally an insult to the character of the people of America,\r\nand to common sense, and could only be suggested by a vicious heart and\r\na corrupt mind.\r\n\r\nThe idea of being attacked by the other states, will appear visionary\r\nand chimerical, if we consider that tho’ several of them have adopted\r\nthe new constitution, yet the opposition to it has been numerous and\r\nformidable. The eastern states from whom we are told we have most\r\nto fear, should a civil war be blown up, would have full employ to\r\nkeep in awe those who are opposed to it in their own governments.\r\nMassachusetts, after a long and dubious contest [10] in their\r\nconvention, has adopted it by an inconsiderable majority, and in the\r\nvery act has marked it with a stigma in its present form. No man of\r\ncandour, judging from their public proceedings, will undertake to say\r\non which side the majority of the people are. Connecticut, it is true,\r\nhave acceded to it, by a large majority of their convention; but it\r\nis a fact well known, that a large proportion of the yeomanry of the\r\ncountry are against it:—And it is equally true, that a considerable\r\npart of those who voted for it in the convention, wish to see it\r\naltered. In both these states the body of the common people, who always\r\ndo the fighting of a country, would be more likely to fight against\r\nthan for it: Can it then be presumed, that a country divided among\r\nthemselves, upon a question where even the advocates for it, admit the\r\nsystem they contend for needs amendments, would make war upon a sister\r\nstate, who only insist that that should be done before they receive it,\r\nwhich it is granted ought to be done after, and where it is confessed\r\nno obligation lies upon them by compact to do it. Can it, I say, be\r\nimagined, that in such a case, they would make war on a sister state?\r\nThe idea is preposterous and chimerical.\r\n\r\nIt is further urged we must adopt this plan because we have no chance\r\nof getting a better. This idea is inconsistent with the principles of\r\nthose who advance it. They say, it must be altered, but it should\r\nbe left until after it is put in operation. But if this objection is\r\nvalid, the proposal of altering, after it is received, is mere delusion.\r\n\r\nIt is granted, that amendments ought to be made; that the exceptions\r\ntaken to the constitution, are grounded on just principles, but it\r\nis still insisted, that alterations are not to be attempted until\r\nafter it is received: But why not? Because it is said, there is no\r\nprobability of agreeing in amendments previous to the adoption, but\r\nthey may be easily made after it. I wish to be informed what there is\r\nin our situation or circumstances that renders it more probable that\r\nwe shall agree in amendments better after, than before submitting to\r\nit? No good reason has as yet been given; it is evident none can be\r\ngiven: On the contrary, there are several considerations which induce\r\na belief, that alterations may be obtained with more ease before than\r\nafter its reception, and if so, every one must agree [11] it is much\r\nthe safest. The importance of preserving an union, and of establishing\r\na government equal to the purpose of maintaining that union, is a\r\nsentiment deeply impressed on the mind of every citizen of America.\r\nIt is now no longer doubted, that the confederation, in its present\r\nform, is inadequate to that end: Some reform in our government must\r\ntake place: In this, all parties agree: It is therefore to be presumed,\r\nthat this object will be pursued with ardour and perseverance, until\r\nit is attained by all parties. But when a government is adopted that\r\npromises to effect this, we are to expect the ardour of many, yea,\r\nof most people, will be abated;—their exertions will cease or be\r\nlanguid, and they will sit down easy, although they may see that the\r\nconstitution which provides for this, does not sufficiently guard the\r\nrights of the people, or secure them against the encroachments of their\r\nrulers. The great end they had in view, the security of the union, they\r\nwill consider effected, and this will divert their attention from that\r\nwhich is equally interesting, safety to their liberties. Besides, the\r\nhuman mind cannot continue intensely engaged for any great length of\r\ntime upon one object. As after a storm, a calm generally succeeds, so\r\nafter the minds of a people have been ardently employed upon a subject,\r\nespecially upon that of government, we commonly find that they become\r\ncool and inattentive: Add to this that those in the community who urge\r\nthe adoption of this system, because they hope to be raised above the\r\ncommon level of their fellow citizens; because they expect to be among\r\nthe number of the few who will be benefitted by it, will more easily\r\nbe induced to consent to the amendments before it is received than\r\nafterwards. Before its reception they will be inclined to be pliant and\r\ncondescending; if they cannot obtain all they wish, they will consent\r\nto take less. They will yield part to obtain the rest. But when the\r\nplan is once agreed to, they will be tenacious of every power, they\r\nwill strenuously contend to retain all they have got; this is natural\r\nto human nature, and it is consonant to the experience of mankind.\r\nFor history affords us no examples of persons once possessed of power\r\nresigning it willingly.\r\n\r\nThe reasonings made use of to persuade us, that no alterations can be\r\nagreed upon previous to the adoption of the system, are as curious as\r\nthey are futile. It is alledged [12], that there was great diversity of\r\nsentiments in forming the proposed constitution; that it was the effect\r\nof mutual concessions and a spirit of accommodation, and from hence it\r\nis inferred, that farther changes cannot be hoped for. I should suppose\r\nthat the contrary inference was the fair one. If the convention,\r\nwho framed this plan, were possessed of such a spirit of moderation\r\nand condescension, as to be induced to yield to each other certain\r\npoints, and to accommodate themselves to each other’s opinions, and\r\neven prejudices, there is reason to expect, that this same spirit will\r\ncontinue and prevail in a future convention, and produce an union of\r\nsentiments on the points objected to. There is more reason to hope for\r\nthis, because the subject has received a full discussion, and the minds\r\nof the people much better known than they were when the convention sat.\r\nPrevious to the meeting of the convention, the subject of a new form\r\nof government had been little thought of, and scarcely written upon at\r\nall. It is true, it was the general opinion, that some alterations were\r\nrequisite in the federal system. This subject had been contemplated by\r\nalmost every thinking man in the union. It had been the subject of many\r\nwell-written essays, and it was the anxious wish of every true friend\r\nto America. But it was never in the contemplation of one in a thousand\r\nof those who had reflected on the matter, to have an entire change in\r\nthe nature of our federal government—to alter it from a confederation\r\nof states, to that of one entire government, which will swallow up that\r\nof the individual states. I will venture to say, that the idea of a\r\ngovernment similar to the one proposed, never entered the minds of the\r\nlegislatures who appointed the convention, and of but very few of the\r\nmembers who composed it, until they had assembled and heard it proposed\r\nin that body: much less had the people any conception of such a plan\r\nuntil after it was promulgated. While it was agitated, the debates of\r\nthe convention were kept an impenetrable secret, and no opportunity\r\nwas given for well informed men to offer their sentiments upon the\r\nsubject. The system was therefore never publicly discussed, nor indeed\r\ncould be, because it was not known to the people until after it was\r\nproposed. Since that, it has been the object of universal attention—it\r\nhas been thought of by every reflecting man—been discussed in a\r\npublic and private manner, in conversation and in print; [13] its\r\ndefects have been pointed out, and every objection to it stated; able\r\nadvocates have written in its favour, and able opponents have written\r\nagainst it. And what is the result? It cannot be denied but that the\r\ngeneral opinion is, that it contains material errors, and requires\r\nimportant amendments. This then being the general sentiment, both of\r\nthe friends and foes of the system, can it be doubted, that another\r\nconvention would concur in such amendments as would quiet the fears of\r\nthe opposers, and effect a great degree of union on the subject?—An\r\nevent most devoutly to be wished. But it is farther said, that there\r\ncan be no prospect of procuring alterations before it is acceded to,\r\nbecause those who oppose it do not agree among themselves with respect\r\nto the amendments that are necessary. To this I reply, that this may\r\nbe urged against attempting alterations after it is received, with as\r\nmuch force as before; and therefore, if it concludes anything, it is\r\nthat we must receive any system of government proposed to us, because\r\nthose who object to it do not entirely concur in their objections.\r\nBut the assertion is not true to any considerable extent. There is\r\na remarkable uniformity in the objections made to the constitution,\r\non the most important points. It is also worthy of notice, that very\r\nfew of the matters found fault with in it, are of a local nature, or\r\nsuch as affect any particular state; on the contrary, they are such as\r\nconcern the principles of general liberty, in which the people of New\r\nHampshire, New York and Georgia are equally interested.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to shew, that in the leading and most important\r\nobjections that have been made to the plan, there has been and is an\r\nentire concurrence of opinion among writers, and in public bodies\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\nI have not time to fully illustrate this by a minute narration of\r\nparticulars; but to prove that this is the case, I shall adduce a\r\nnumber of important instances.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to that the new system, that it is calculated to,\r\nand will effect such a consolidation of the States, as to supplant and\r\noverturn the state governments. In this the minority of Pennsylvania,\r\nthe opposition in Massachusetts, and all the writers of any ability or\r\nnote in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston concur. It may be added,\r\nthat this appears to have been the opinion of the Massachusetts\r\nconvention, and gave rise to that article in [14] the amendments\r\nproposed, which confines the general government to the exercise only of\r\npowers expressly given.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the representation in the general legislature\r\nis too small to secure liberty, or to answer the intention of\r\nrepresentation. In this there is an union of sentiments in the opposers.\r\n\r\nThe constitution has been opposed, because it gives to the legislature\r\nan unlimited power of taxation both with respect to direct and indirect\r\ntaxes, a right to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises of\r\nevery kind and description, and to any amount. In this there has been\r\nas general a concurrence of opinion as in the former.\r\n\r\nThe opposers to the constitution have said that it is dangerous,\r\nbecause the judicial power may extend to many cases which ought to be\r\nreserved to the decision of the State courts, and because the right\r\nof trial by jury is not secured in the judicial courts of the general\r\ngovernment, in civil cases. All the opposers are agreed in this\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nThe power of the general legislature to alter and regulate the time,\r\nplace and manner of holding elections, has been stated as an argument\r\nagainst the adoption of the system. It has been argued that this power\r\nwill place in the hands of the general government, the authority,\r\nwhenever they shall be disposed, and a favorable opportunity offers,\r\nto deprive the body of the people in effect, of all share in the\r\ngovernment. The opposers to the constitution universally agree in this\r\nobjection, and of such force is it, that most of its ardent advocates\r\nadmit its validity, and those who have made attempts to vindicate it,\r\nhave been reduced to the necessity of using the most trifling arguments\r\nto justify it.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of legislative, judicial, and executive powers in the\r\nsenate; the little degree of responsibility under which the great\r\nofficers of government will be held; and the liberty granted by the\r\nsystem to establish and maintain a standing army without any limitation\r\nor restriction, are also objected to the constitution; and in these\r\nthere is a great degree of unanimity of sentiment in the opposers.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks it appears, that the opponents to the system accord\r\nin the great and material points on which they wish amendments. For the\r\ntruth of the assertion [15], I appeal to the protest of the minority\r\nof the convention of Pennsylvania, to all the publications against the\r\nconstitution, and to the debates of the convention of Massachusetts. As\r\na higher authority than these, I appeal to the amendments proposed by\r\nthe Massachusetts; these are to be considered as the sense of that body\r\nupon the defects of the system. And it is a fact, which I will venture\r\nto assert, that a large majority of the convention were of opinion,\r\nthat a number of additional alterations ought to be made. Upon reading\r\nthe articles which they propose as amendments, it will appear that\r\nthey object to indefinite powers in the legislature—to the power of\r\nlaying direct taxes—to the authority of regulating elections—to the\r\nextent of the judicial powers, both as it respects the inferior court\r\nand the appellate jurisdiction—to the smallness of the representation,\r\n&c.—It is admitted that some writers have advanced objections that\r\nothers have not noticed—that exceptions have been taken by some, that\r\nhave not been insisted upon by others, and it is probable, that some\r\nof the opponents may approve what others will reject. But still these\r\ndifference are on matters of small importance, and of such a nature\r\nas the persons who hold different opinions will not be tenacious of.\r\nPerfect uniformity of sentiment on so great a political subject is not\r\nto be expected. Every sensible man is impressed with this idea, and is\r\ntherefore prepared to make concessions and accommodate on matters of\r\nsmall importance. It is sufficient that we agree in the great leading\r\nprinciples, which relate to the preservation of public liberty and\r\nprivate security. And on these I will venture to affirm we are as well\r\nagreed, as any people ever were on a question of this nature. I dare\r\npronounce that were the principal advocates for the proposed plan to\r\nwrite comments upon it, they would differ more in the sense they would\r\ngive the constitution, than those who oppose it do, in the amendments\r\nthey would wish. I am justified in this opinion, by the sentiments\r\nadvanced by the different writers in favour of the constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is farther insisted, that six states have already adopted the\r\nconstitution; that probably nine will agree to it; in which case it\r\nwill be put in operation. That it is unreasonable to expect that those\r\nstates which have acceded [16] to it will reconsider the subject in\r\ncompliance with the wishes of a minority.\r\n\r\nTo perceive the force of this objection it is proper to review the\r\nconduct and circumstances of the states which have acceded it. It\r\ncannot be controverted, that Connecticut and New Jersey were very\r\nmuch influenced in their determinations on the questions, by local\r\nconsiderations. The duty of impost laid by this state, has been a\r\nsubject of complaint by those states. The new constitution transfers\r\nthe power of imposing these duties from the state to the general\r\ngovernment, and carries the proceeds to the use of the union, instead\r\nof that of those state. This is a popular matter with the people of\r\nthose states, and at the same time, is not advanced by the sensible\r\nopposers to the system in this state as an objection to it.—To excite\r\nin the minds of the people of these states an attachment to the new\r\nsystem, the amount of the revenue arising from our impost has been\r\nmagnified to a much larger sum than it produces; it has been stated\r\nto amount to from sixty to eighty thousand pounds lawful money; and a\r\ngentleman of high eminence in Connecticut has lent the authority of his\r\nname to support it. It has been said, that Connecticut pays a third of\r\nthis sum annually for impost, and Jersey nearly as much. It has farther\r\nbeen asserted, that the avails of the impost were applied to the\r\nseparate use of the state of New York. By these assertions the people\r\nhave been grossly imposed upon, for neither of them are true.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the revenue from impost for two years past, has\r\nnot exceeded fifty thousands pounds currency, per annum, and a\r\ndrawback of duties is allowed by law, upon all goods exported to the\r\nbeforementioned states, in casks or packages unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this sum, and more, has been paid into the federal\r\ntreasury for the support of the government of the union. All the states\r\ntherefore have actually derived equal benefit with the state of New\r\nYork, from the impost. It may be said, I know, that this state has\r\nobtained credit for the amount, upon the requisitions of Congress: It\r\nis admitted, but still it is a fact, that other states, and especially\r\nthose who complain, have paid no part of the monies required of them,\r\nand have scarcely made an effort to do it. The fact therefore is, that\r\nthey have received [17] as much advantage from the impost of this state\r\nas we ourselves have. The proposed constitution directs to no mode,\r\nin which the deficiencies of states on former requisitions, are to be\r\ncollected, but seems to hold out the idea, that we are to start out\r\nanew, and all past payments be forgotten. It is natural to expect, that\r\nselfish motives will have too powerful an influence on men’s minds,\r\nand that too often, they will shut the eyes of a people to their best\r\nand true interest. The people of those states have been persuaded to\r\nbelieve, that this new constitution will relieve them from the burden\r\nof taxes, by providing for all the exigencies of the union, by duties\r\nwhich can be raised only in the neighbouring states. When they come to\r\nbe convinced, that this promise is a mere delusion, as they assuredly\r\nwill, by finding the continental tax-gatherer knocking at their doors,\r\nif not before, they will be among the first to urge amendments, and\r\nperhaps the most violent to obtain them. But notwithstanding the\r\nlocal prejudices which operate upon the people of these states, a\r\nconsiderable part of them wish for amendments. It is not to be doubted\r\nthat a considerable majority of the people of Connecticut wish for\r\nthem, and many in Jersey have the same desires, and their numbers are\r\nincreasing. It cannot be disputed, that amendments would accord with\r\nthe sentiments of a great majority in Massachusetts, or that they\r\nwould be agreeable to the greater part of the people of Pennsylvania:\r\nThere is no reason to doubt but that they would be agreeable to\r\nDelaware and Georgia—If then, the states who have already ratified the\r\nconstitution, are desirous to have alterations made in it, what reason\r\ncan be assigned why they should not cordially meet with overtures for\r\nthat purpose from any state, and concur in appointing a convention to\r\neffect it? Mankind are easily induced to fall into measures to obtain\r\nan object agreeable to them. In this case, the states would not only\r\nbe moved by this universal principle of human nature, but by the\r\nstrong and powerful motive of uniting all the states under a form of\r\ngovernment agreeable to them.\r\n\r\nI shall now dismiss the consideration of objections made to attempting\r\nalterations previous to the adoption of the plan, but before I close,\r\nI beg your indulgence, while I make some remarks on the splendid\r\nadvantages which the advocates of this system say are to be derived\r\nfrom it.—Hope and fear are two of the most active principles of [18]\r\nour nature: We have considered how the latter is addressed on this\r\noccasion, and with how little reason: It will appear that the promises\r\nit makes, are as little to be relied upon as its threatenings. We are\r\namused with the fair prospects that are to open, when this government\r\nis put into operation—Agriculture is to flourish, and our fields to\r\nyield an hundred fold—Commerce is to expand her wings, and bear our\r\nproductions to all the ports in the world—Money is to pour into our\r\ncountry through every channel—Arts and manufactures are to rear their\r\nheads, and every mecanic find full employ—Those who are in debt, are\r\nto find easy means to procure money to pay them—Public burdens and\r\ntaxes are to be lightened, and yet all our public debts are soon to\r\nbe discharged.—With such vain and delusive hopes are the minds of\r\nmany honest and well meaning people fed, and by these means are they\r\nled inconsiderately to contend for a government, which is made to\r\npromise what it cannot perform; while their minds are diverted from\r\ncontemplating its true nature, or considering whether is will not\r\nendanger their liberties, and work oppression.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to object to granting the general government the\r\npower of regulating trade, and of laying imposts and duties for that\r\npurpose, as well as for raising a revenue: But it is as far from me\r\nto flatter people with hopes of benefits to be derived from such a\r\nchange in our government which can never be realized. Some advantages\r\nmay accrue from vesting in one general government, the right to\r\nregulate commerce, but it is a vain delusion to expect anything like\r\nwhat is promised. The truth is, this country buys more than it sells:\r\nIt imports more than it exports. There are too many merchants in\r\nproportion to the farmers and manufacturers. Until these defects are\r\nremedied, no government can relieve us. Common sense dictates, that\r\nif a man buys more than he sells, he will remain in debt; the same is\r\ntrue of a country.—And as long as this country imports more goods than\r\nthe exports——the overplus must be paid for in money or not paid at\r\nall. These few remarks may convince us, that the radical remedy for the\r\nscarcity of cash is frugality and industry. Earn much and spend little,\r\nand you will be enabled to pay your debts, and have money in your\r\npockets; and if you do not follow [19] this advice, no government that\r\ncan be framed, will relieve you.\r\n\r\nAs to the idea of being relieved from taxes by this government, it\r\nis an affront to common sense, to advance it. There is no complaint\r\nmade against the present confederation more justly founded than this,\r\nthat it is incompetent to provide the means to discharge our national\r\ndebt, and to support the national government. Its inefficacy to these\r\npurposes, which was early seen and felt, was the first thing that\r\nsuggested the necessity of changing the government; other things,\r\nit is true, were afterwards found to require alterations; but this\r\nwas the most important, and accordingly we find, that while in some\r\nother things the powers of this government seem to be in some measure\r\nlimited, on the subject of raising money, no bounds are set to it.\r\nIt is authorised to raise money to any amount, and in any way it\r\npleases. If then, the capital embarrassment in our present government\r\narises from the want of money, and this constitution effectually\r\nauthorises the raising of it, how are the taxes to be lessened by it?\r\nCertainly money can only be raised by taxes of some kind or other;\r\nit must be got either by additional impositions on trade, by excise,\r\nor by direct taxes, or what is more probable, by all together. In\r\neither way, it amounts to the same thing, and the position is clear,\r\nthat as the necessities of the nation require more money than is\r\nnow raised, the taxes must be enhanced. This you ought to know, and\r\nprepare yourselves to submit to.—Besides, how is it possible that the\r\ntaxes can be decreased when the expences of your government will be\r\ngreatly advanced? It does not require any great skill in politics, or\r\nability at calculation to shew, that the new government will cost more\r\nmoney to administer it, than the present. I shall not descend to an\r\nestimate of the cost of a federal town, the salaries of the president,\r\nvice-president, judges, and other great officers of state, nor\r\ncalculate the amount of the pay the legislature will vote themselves,\r\nor the salaries that will be paid the innumerable and subordinate\r\nofficers. The bare mention of these things is sufficient to convince\r\nyou, that the new government will be vastly more expensive than the\r\nold: And how is the money to answer these purposes to be obtained?\r\nIt is obvious, it must be taken out of the pockets of the people, by\r\ntaxes, in some mode or other.\r\n\r\n[20] Having remarked upon the arguments which have been advanced, to\r\ninduce you to accede to this government, without amendments, and I\r\ntrust refuted them, suffer me to close with an address dedicated by the\r\naffection of a brother, and the honest zeal of a lover of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Friends, countrymen, and fellow-citizens_,\r\n\r\nThe present is the most important crisis at which you ever have\r\narrived. You have before you a question big with consequences,\r\nunutterably important to yourselves, to your children, to generations\r\nyet unborn, to the cause of liberty and of mankind; every motive of\r\nreligion and virtue, of private happiness and public good, of honour\r\nand dignity, should urge you to consider cooly and determine wisely.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the governments that have arisen among mankind, have\r\nsprung from force and violence. The records of history inform us of\r\nnone that have been the result of cool and dispassionate reason and\r\nreflection: It is reserved for this favoured country to exhibit to\r\nmankind the first example.——This opportunity is now given us, and we\r\nare to exercise our rights in the choice of persons to represent us in\r\nconvention, to deliberate and determine upon the constitution proposed:\r\nIt will be to our everlasting disgrace to be indifferent on such a\r\nsubject; for it is impossible, we can contemplate anything that relates\r\nto the affairs of this life of half the importance.\r\n\r\nYou have heard that both sides on this great question, agree, that\r\nthere are in it great defects; yet the one side tell you, choose such\r\nmen as will adopt it, and then amend it——while the other say, amend\r\nprevious to its adoption.——I have stated to you my reasons for the\r\nlatter, and I think they are unanswerable.—Consider you the common\r\npeople the yeomanry of the country, for to such I principally address\r\nmyself, you are to be the principal losers, if the constitution should\r\nprove oppressive; When a tyranny is established, there are always\r\nmasters as well as slaves; the great and well-born are generally the\r\nformer, and the middling class the latter—Attempts have been made,\r\nand will be repeated, to alarm you with the fear of consequences;\r\nbut reflect there are consequences on both sides, and none can be\r\napprehended more dreadful, than entailing on ourselves and posterity\r\n[21] a government which will raise a few to the height of human\r\ngreatness and wealth, while it will depress the many to the extreme of\r\npoverty and wretchedness. Consequences are under the controul of that\r\nall-wise and all-powerful being, whose providence conducts the affairs\r\nof all men: Our part is to act right, and we may then have confidence\r\nthat the consequences will be favourable. The path in which you should\r\nwalk is plain and open before you; be united as one man, and direct\r\nyour choice to such men as have been uniform in their opposition to the\r\nproposed system in its present form, or without proper alterations:\r\nIn men of this description you have reason to place confidence, while\r\non the other hand, you have just cause to distrust those who urge\r\nthe adoption of a bad constitution, under the delusive expectation\r\nof making amendments after it is acceded to. Your jealousy of such\r\ncharacters should be the more excited, when you consider that the\r\nadvocates for the constitution have shifted their ground. When men are\r\nuniform in their opinions, it affords evidence that they are sincere:\r\nWhen they are shifting, it gives reason to believe, they do not change\r\nfrom conviction. It must be recollected, that when this plan was first\r\nannounced to the public, its supporters cried it up as the most perfect\r\nproduction of human wisdom; It was represented either as having no\r\ndefects, or if it had, they were so trifling and inconsiderable, that\r\nthey served only, as the shades in a fine picture, to set off the\r\npiece to the greater advantage. One gentleman in Philadelphia went so\r\nfar in the ardour of his enthusiasm in its favour, as to pronounce,\r\nthat the men who formed it were as really under the guidance of Divine\r\nRevelation, as was Moses, the Jewish lawgiver. Their language is now\r\nchanged; the question has been discussed; the objections to the plan\r\nably stated, and they are admitted to be unanswerable. The same men\r\nwho held it almost perfect, now admit it is very imperfect; that it is\r\nnecessary it should be amended. The only question between us, is simply\r\nthis: Shall we accede to a bad constitution, under the uncertain\r\nprospect of getting it amended, after we have received it, or shall we\r\namend it before we adopt it? Common sense will point out which is the\r\nmost rational, which is the most secure line of conduct. May heaven\r\ninspire you with wisdom, union, moderation and firmness [22], and give\r\nyou hearts to make a proper estimate of your invaluable privileges, and\r\npreserve them to you, to be transmitted to your posterity unimpaired,\r\nand may they be maintained in this our country, while Sun and Moon\r\nendure.\r\n\r\n A PLEBEIAN.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing pages have been put to the press, a pamphlet has\r\nappeared, entitled, “An address to the people of the state of New York,\r\non the subject of the new constitution, &c.” Upon a cursory examination\r\nof this performance (for I have not had time to give it more than a\r\ncursory examination) it appears to contain little more than declamation\r\nand observations that have been often repeated by the advocates of the\r\nnew constitution.\r\n\r\nAn attentive reader will readily perceive, that almost everything\r\ndeserving the name of an argument in this publication, has received\r\nconsideration, and, I trust, a satisfactory answer in the preceding\r\nremarks, so far as they apply to prove the necessity of an immediate\r\nadoption of the plan, without amendments.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore only beg the patience of my readers, while I make a\r\nfew very brief remarks on this piece.\r\n\r\nThe author introduces his observations with a short history of the\r\nrevolution, and of the establishment of the present existing federal\r\ngovernment. He draws a frightful picture of our condition under the\r\npresent confederation. The whole of what he says on that head, stripped\r\nof its artificial colouring, amounts to this, that the existing system\r\nis rather commendatory than coercive, or that Congress have not in most\r\ncases, the power of enforcing their own resolves. This he calls “a new\r\nand wonderful system.” However “wonderful” it may seem, it certainly\r\nis not “new.” For most of the _federal governments_ that have been in\r\nthe world, have been of the same nature.——The united Netherlands\r\nare governed on the same plan. There are other governments also now\r\nexisting, which are in a similar condition with our’s, with regard to\r\nseveral particulars, on account of which this author denominates it\r\n“new and wonderful.”——The king of Great Britain “may make war, but\r\nhas not power to raise money to carry it on.” He may borrow money, but\r\nit is without the means of repayment, &c. For these he is dependent on\r\nhis parliament. But it is needless to add on [24] this head, because\r\nit is admitted that the powers of the general government ought to be\r\nincreased in several of the particulars this author instances. But\r\nthese things are mentioned to shew, that the outcry made against the\r\nconfederation, as being a system new, unheard of, and absurd, is really\r\nwithout foundation.\r\n\r\nThe author proceeds to depicture our present condition in the\r\nhigh-wrought strains common to his party.——I shall add nothing to\r\nwhat I have said on this subject in the former part of this pamphlet,\r\nbut will only observe, that his imputing our being kept out of the\r\npossession of the western posts, and our want of peace with the\r\nAlgerines, to the defects in our present government, is much easier\r\nsaid than proved. The British keep possession of these posts, because\r\nit subserves their interest, and probably will do so, until they\r\nperceive that we have gathered strength and resources sufficient\r\nto assert our rights with the sword. Let our government be what it\r\nwill, this cannot be done without time and patience. In the present\r\nexhausted situation of the country, it would be madness in us, had we\r\never so perfect a government, to commence a war for the recovery of\r\nthese posts.——With regard to the Algerines, there are but two ways\r\nin which their ravages can be prevented. The one is, by a successful\r\nwar against them, and the other is by treaty. The powers of Congress\r\nunder the confederation are completely competent either to declare war\r\nagainst them, or to form treaties. Money, it is true, is necessary to\r\ndo both these. This only brings us to this conclusion, that the great\r\ndefect in our present government, is the want of powers to provide\r\nmoney for the public exigencies. I am willing to grant _reasonable_\r\npowers, on this score, but not unlimited ones; commercial treaties may\r\nbe made under the present powers of Congress. I am persuaded we flatter\r\nourselves with advantages which will result from them, that will never\r\nbe realized. I know of no benefits that we receive from any that have\r\nyet been formed.\r\n\r\nThis author tells us, “it is not his design to investigate merits of\r\nthe plan, nor of the objections made to it.” It is well he did not\r\nundertake it, for if he had, from the specimen he has given, the cause\r\nhe assumes would not have probably gained much strength by it.\r\n\r\nHe however takes notice of two or three of the many objections brought\r\nagainst the plan.\r\n\r\n“We are told, (says he) among other strange things, that the liberty\r\nof the press is left insecure by the proposed constitution, and yet\r\nthat constitution says neither more nor less [25] about it, than the\r\nconstitution of the state of New York does. We are told it deprives us\r\nof trial by jury, whereas the fact is, that it expressly secures it in\r\ncertain cases, and takes it away in none, &c. it is absurd to construe\r\nthe silence of this, or of our own constitution relative to a great\r\nnumber of our rights into a total extinction of them; silence and a\r\nblank paper neither grant nor take away anything.”\r\n\r\nIt may be a strange thing to this author to hear the people of America\r\nanxious for the preservation of their rights, but those who understand\r\nthe true principles of liberty, are no strangers to their importance.\r\nThe man who supposes the constitution, in any part of it, is like a\r\nblank piece of paper, has very erroneous ideas of it. He may be assured\r\nevery clause has a meaning, and many of them such extensive meaning,\r\nas would take a volume to unfold. The suggestion, that the liberty of\r\nthe press is secure, because it is not in express words spoken of in\r\nthe constitution, and that the trial by jury is not taken away, because\r\nit is not said in so many words and letters it is so, is puerile and\r\nunworthy of a man who pretends to reason. We contend, that by the\r\nindefinite powers granted to the general government, the liberty of the\r\npress may be restricted by duties, &c. and therefore the constitution\r\nought to have stipulated for its freedom. The trial by jury, in all\r\ncivil cases is left at the discretion of the general government, except\r\nin the supreme court on the appelate jurisdiction, and in this I affirm\r\nit is taken away, not by express words, but by fair and legitimate\r\nconstruction and inference; for the supreme court have expressly given\r\nthem an appelate jurisdiction, in every case to which their powers\r\nextend (with two or three exceptions) both as to _law and fact_. The\r\ncourt are the judges; every man in the country, who has served as a\r\njuror, knows, that there is a difference between the court and the\r\njury, and that the lawyers in their pleading, make the distinction. If\r\nthe court, upon appeals, are to determine both the law and the fact,\r\nthere is no room for a jury, and the right of trial in this mode is\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nThe author manifests levity in referring to the constitution of this\r\nstate, to shew that it was useless to stipulate for the liberty of the\r\npress, or to insert a bill of rights in the constitution. With regard\r\nto the first, it is perhaps an imperfection in our constitution that\r\nthe liberty of the press is not expressly reserved; but still there was\r\nnot equal necessity of making this reservation in our State as in the\r\ngeneral Constitution, for the common and statute law of England, and\r\nthe laws of the [26] colony are established, in which this privilege is\r\nfully defined and secured. It is true, a bill of rights is not prefixed\r\nto our constitution, as it is in that of some of the states; but still\r\nthis author knows, that many essential rights are reserved in the body\r\nof it; and I will promise, that every opposer of this system will be\r\nsatisfied, if the stipulations that they contend for are agreed to,\r\nwhether they are prefixed, affixed, or inserted in the body of the\r\nconstitution, and that they will not contend which way this is done,\r\nif it be but done. I shall add but one remark, and that is upon the\r\nhackneyed argument introduced by the author, drawn from the character\r\nand ability of the framers of the new constitution. The favourers of\r\nthis system are not very prudent in bringing this forward. It provokes\r\nto an investigation of characters, which is an inviduous task. I do\r\nnot wish to detract from their merits, but I will venture to affirm,\r\nthat twenty assemblies of equal number might be collected, equally\r\nrespectable both in point of ability, integrity, and patriotism. Some\r\nof the characters which compose it I revere; others I consider as of\r\nsmall consequence, and a number are suspected of being great public\r\ndefaulters, and to have been guilty of notorious peculation and fraud,\r\nwith regard to public property in the hour of our distress. I will not\r\ndescend to personalities, nor would I have said so much on the subject,\r\nhad it not been in self defence. Let the constitution stand on its own\r\nmerits. If it be good, it stands not in need of great men’s names to\r\nsupport it. If it be bad, their names ought not to sanction it.\r\n\r\n  FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weakness of Brutus exposed: / or, some / Remarks / in /\r\nVindication of the Constitution / proposed by the late / Federal\r\nConvention, / against the / Objections and gloomy Fears of that Writer\r\n/ Humbly offered to the Public, / By / a Citizen of Philadelphia.\r\n/ Philadelphia, / Printed for, and to be had of John Sparhawk, in\r\nMarket-Street, / near the Court House / M.DCC.LXXXVII.\r\n\r\n  12mo., pp. 23.\r\n\r\n  Written by Pelatiah Webster, a Philadelphia merchant, and author of\r\n  a number of pamphlets on the finances and government of the United\r\n  States, most of which he reprinted in his “Political Essays” in\r\n  Philadelphia in 1791.\r\n\r\n  Brutus was the signature (of Thomas Treadwell, of Suffolk County,\r\n  N.Y.?) to a series of sixteen newspaper essays in the _New York\r\n  Journal_, which were extensively copied throughout the country. This\r\n  is an answer to the first essay only, and was published November 4th,\r\n  1787.\r\n\r\n  P. L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long piece signed BRUTUS, (which was first published in a New-York\r\npaper, and was afterwards copied into the Pennsylvania Packet of the\r\n26th instant) is wrote in a very good stile; the language is easy, and\r\nthe address is polite and insinuating: but the sentiments, I conceive,\r\nare not only unsound, but wild and chimerical; the dreary fears and\r\napprehensions, altogether groundless; and the whole tendency of the\r\npiece, in this important crisis of our politics, very hurtful. I have\r\ntherefore thought it my duty to make some animadversions on it; which I\r\nhere offer, with all due deference, to the Author and to the Public.\r\n\r\nHis first question is, _Whether a confederated government is best for\r\nthe United States?_\r\n\r\nI answer, If Brutus, or any body else, cannot find any benefit\r\nresulting from the union of the Thirteen States; if they can do\r\n_without_ as well as _with_ the respectability, the protection, and\r\nthe security, which the States might derive from that union, I have\r\nnothing further to say: but if that union is to be supported in any\r\nsuch manner as to afford [4] respectability, protection, or security to\r\nthe States, I say it must be done by an adequate government, and cannot\r\nbe otherwise done.\r\n\r\nThis government must have a supreme power, _superior to and able to\r\ncontroul_ each and all of its parts. ’Tis essential to all governments,\r\nthat such a power be somewhere existing in it; and if _the place_ where\r\nthe proposed Constitution has fixed it, does not suit Brutus and his\r\nfriends, I will give him leave to stow it away in any _other place that\r\nis better_: but I will not consent to have it _annihilated_; neither\r\nwill I agree to have it _cramped and pinched_ for room, so as to lessen\r\nits energy; for that will _destroy_ both its nature and use.\r\n\r\nThe supreme power of government ought to be _full_, _definite_,\r\n_established_, and _acknowledged_. Powers of government too limited, or\r\nuncertain and disputed, have ever proved, like _Pandora’s_ box, a most\r\nfruitful source of quarrels, animosities, wars, devastation, and ruin,\r\nin all shapes and degrees, in all communities, states and kingdoms on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nNothing tends more to the honour, establishment, and peace of society,\r\nthan public decisions, grounded on principles of right, natural fitness\r\nand prudence; but when the powers of government are _too limited_, such\r\ndecisions can’t be made and enforced; so the mischief goes without a\r\nremedy: dreadful examples of which we have felt, in instances more than\r\nenough, for seven years past.\r\n\r\n[5] Further, where the powers of government are not _definite_ but\r\n_disputed_, the administration dare not make decisions on the footing\r\nof impartial justice and right; but must temporize with the parties,\r\nlest they lose friends or make enemies: and of course the _righteous_\r\ngo off injured and disgusted, and the _wicked_ go grumbling to; for\r\n’tis rare that any sacrifices of a court can satisfy a prevailing party\r\nin the state.\r\n\r\n’Tis necessary in States, as well as in private families, that\r\ncontroversies should have a just, _speedy_,and effectual decision,\r\nthat right may be done before the contention has _time_ to grow up\r\ninto habits of malignity, resentment, ill nature, and ill offices. If\r\na controversy happens between two states, must it continue undecided,\r\nand daily increase, and be more and more aggravated, by the repeated\r\ninsults and injuries of the contending parties, ’till they are ripe for\r\nthe decision of the sword? or must the weaker states suffer, without\r\nremedy, the groundless demands and oppressions of their stronger\r\nneighbours, because they have no avenger, or umpire of their disputes?\r\n\r\nOr shall we institute a supreme power with full and effectual authority\r\nto controul the animosities, and decide the disputes of these strong\r\ncontending bodies? In the one proposed to us, we have perhaps every\r\nchance of a _righteous judgment_, that we have any reason [6] to hope\r\nfor; but I am clearly of opinion, that even a _wrongful decision_,\r\nwould, in most cases, be preferable to the continuance of such\r\ndestructive controversies.\r\n\r\nI suppose that neither Brutus nor any of his friends would wish to\r\nsee our government _embroiled abroad_; and therefore will admit it\r\nnecessary to institute some federal authority, sufficient to punish\r\n_any individual or State_, who shall violate our treaties with foreign\r\nnations, insult their dignity, or abuse their citizens, and compel due\r\nreparation in all such cases.\r\n\r\nI further apprehend, that Brutus is willing to have the _general_\r\ninterest and _welfare_ of the States well provided for and supported,\r\nand therefore will consent that there shall exist in the states, an\r\nauthority to _do_ all this _effectually_; but he seems grieved that\r\nCongress should be the _judges of this general welfare_ of the states.\r\nIf he will be kind enough to point out any other more suitable and\r\nproper judges, I will consent to have them admitted.\r\n\r\nIndeed I begin to have hopes of Brutus, and think he may come right at\r\nlast; for I observe (after all his fear and tremblings about the new\r\ngovernment) the constitution he _defines and adopts_, is the very same\r\nas that which the federal convention have proposed to us, _viz._ “that\r\nthe Thirteen States should continue thirteen confederated republics\r\nunder the _direction and controul_ of a supreme [7] federal head, for\r\ncertain defined national purposes, only.” Where we may observe,\r\n\r\n1. That the new Constitution leaves all the Thirteen States, complete\r\nrepublics, as it found them, but all confederated under the direction\r\nand controul of a federal head, for certain defined national purposes\r\nonly, _i. e._ it leaves all the dignities, authorities, and internal\r\npolice of each State in free, full, and perfect condition; unless when\r\nnational purposes make the controul of them by the federal head, or\r\nauthority, necessary to the general benefit.\r\n\r\n2. These powers of controul by the federal head or authority, are\r\n_defined_ in the new constitution, as minutely as may be, in their\r\nprinciple; and any detail of them which may become necessary, is\r\ncommitted to the wisdom of Congress.\r\n\r\n3. It extends the controuling power of the federal head to no one case,\r\nto which the jurisdiction or power of definitive decision of any one\r\nstate, can be competent. And,\r\n\r\n4. In every such case, the controuling power of the federal head,\r\nis absolutely necessary to the support, dignity, and benefit of the\r\nnational government, and the safety of individuals; neither of which\r\ncan, by any possibility, be secured without it.\r\n\r\nAll this falls in pretty well with Brutus’s sentiments; for he does not\r\nthink that the new Constitution in _its present state_ so very bad, [8]\r\nbut fears that it will not preserve its purity of institution; but if\r\nadopted, will immediately verge to, and terminate in _a consolidation_,\r\n_i. e._ a destruction of the state governments. For argument, he\r\nsuggests the avidity of power natural to rulers; and the eager grasp\r\nwith which they hold it when obtained; and their strong propensity to\r\nabuse their power, and encroach on the liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nHe dwells on the vast powers vested in Congress by the new\r\nConstitution, _i. e._ of levying taxes, raising armies, appointing\r\nfederal courts, &c.; takes it for granted, that all these powers will\r\nbe abused, and carried to an oppressive excess; and then harangues on\r\nthe dreadful case we shall be in, when our _wealth_ is all devoured by\r\ntaxes, our _liberty_ destroyed by the power of the army, and our _civil\r\nrights_ all sacrificed by the unbounded power of the federal courts, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd when he has run himself out of breath with this dreary declamation,\r\nhe comes to the conclusion he set out with, _viz._ That the Thirteen\r\nStates are too big for a republican government, which requires _small\r\nterritory_, and can’t be supported in _more extensive nations_; that\r\nin large states liberty will soon be swallowed up, and lost in the\r\nmagnitude of power requisite in the government, &c.\r\n\r\n[9] If any conclusion at all can be drawn from this baseless assemblage\r\nof gloomy thoughts, I think it must be _against any union at all_;\r\nagainst _any kind of federal government_. For nothing can be plainer\r\nthan this, _viz._ that _the union can’t by any possibility be supported\r\nwith success, without adequate and effectual powers of government?_\r\n\r\nWe must have _money_ to support the union, and therefore the power of\r\nraising it must be lodged somewhere; we must have _a military force_,\r\nand of consequence the power of raising and directing it must exist;\r\ncivil and criminal causes of national concern will arise, therefore\r\nthere must be somewhere a power of appointing _courts_ to hear and\r\ndetermine them.\r\n\r\nThese powers must be vested in Congress; for nobody pretends to wish to\r\nhave them vested in any other body of men.\r\n\r\nThe Thirteen States have a territory very extensive, and inhabitants\r\nvery numerous, and every day rapidly increasing; therefore the powers\r\nof government necessary to support their union must be great in\r\nproportion. If the ship is large the mast must be proportionately\r\ngreat, or it will be impossible to make her sail well. The federal\r\npowers must extend to every part of the federal territory, _i.e._ to\r\nthe utmost limits of the Thirteen States, and to every part of them;\r\nand must carry with them, sufficient [10] authority to secure the\r\nexecution of them; and these powers must be vested in Congress, and the\r\nexecution of them must be under their direction and controul.\r\n\r\nThese powers are _vast_, I know, and the trust is of the most _weighty\r\nkind_ that can be committed to human direction; and the execution and\r\nadministration of it will require the greatest _wisdom_, _knowledge_,\r\n_firmness_, and _integrity_ in that august body; and I hope they will\r\nhave all the _abilities and virtues_ necessary to that important\r\nstation, and will _perform their duty well_; but if they fail, the\r\nfault is in them, not in the constitution. The best constitution\r\npossible, even a divine one, badly administered, will make a bad\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe members of Congress will be the best we can get; they will all of\r\nthem derive their appointment from the States, and if the States are\r\nnot wise enough to send _good and suitable_ men, great _blame_, great\r\n_sin_ will lie at their door. Put I suppose nobody would wish to mend\r\nthis fault by taking away the election of the people, and directing the\r\nappointment of Congress to be made in any other way.\r\n\r\nWhen we have got the best that can be obtained, we ought to be quiet\r\nand cease complaining. ’Tis not in the power of human wisdom to do\r\nmore; ’tis the fate of human nature to _be imperfect and to err_;\r\nand [11] no doubt but Congress, with all their _dignity of station\r\nand character_, with all their _opportunities_ to gain _wisdom and\r\ninformation_, with all their _inducements to virtue and integrity_,\r\nwill err, and abuse or misapply their powers in more or less instances.\r\nI have no expectation that they will make _a court of angels_, or\r\nbe anything more than _men_: ’tis probable many of them will be\r\n_insufficient_ men, and some of them may be _bad men_.\r\n\r\nThe greatest wisdom, care, and caution, has been used in the _mode_ of\r\ntheir appointment; in the _restraints and checks_ under which they must\r\nact; in the numerous _discussions and deliberations_ which all their\r\nacts must pass through, before they can receive the stamp of authority;\r\nin the terrors of _punishment_ if they misbehave. I say, in all _these\r\nways_ the greatest care has been used to procure and form a good\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe _dignity and importance_ of their station and character will afford\r\nall the inducements to virtue and effort, which can influence a mind\r\n_capable_ of their force.\r\n\r\nTheir own _personal reputation_, with the eyes of all the world on\r\nthem,—the _approbation of their fellow citizens_, which every man in\r\npublic station naturally wishes to enjoy,—and the _dread of censure\r\nand shame_, all contribute very forceable and strong inducements to\r\nnoble, upright and worthy behavior.\r\n\r\n[12] The _particular interest_ which every member of Congress has in\r\nevery public order and resolution, is _another strong motive_ to right\r\naction. For every act to which any member gives his sanction, if it be\r\nraising an _army_, levying a _tax_, instituting a _court_, or any other\r\nact to bind the _States_,—such act will equally bind _himself, his\r\nnearest connections, and his posterity_.\r\n\r\nAnother mighty influence to the noblest principle of action will be\r\n_the fear of God before their eyes_; for while they sit in the place\r\nof God, to give law, justice, and right to the States, they must be\r\n_monsters indeed_ if they do not regard _his law_, and imitate _his\r\ncharacter_.\r\n\r\nIf all this will not produce a Congress fit to be trusted, and worthy\r\nof the public confidence, I think we may give the matter up as\r\nimpracticable. But still we must make ourselves as easy as we can,\r\nunder a _mischief_ which admits _no remedy_, and bear with patience\r\nan _evil_ which can’t be _cured_: for a government we must have; there\r\nis no safety without it; though we know it will be imperfect, we still\r\nmust prefer it to anarchy or no government at all. ’Tis the height of\r\nfolly and madness to reject a necessary convenience, because it is not\r\na perfect good.\r\n\r\nUpon this statement of facts and principles, (for the truth and reality\r\nof which, I appeal [13] to every candid man,) I beg leave to remark,\r\n\r\n1. That the federal Convention, in the constitution proposed to us,\r\nhave exerted their utmost to produce _a Congress worthy of the public\r\nconfidence_, who shall have _abilities_ adequate to their important\r\nduty, and shall act under every possible inducement to execute it\r\n_faithfully_.\r\n\r\n2. That this affords every chance which the nature of the thing will\r\nadmit, of a wise and upright administration.\r\n\r\n3. Yet all this notwithstanding, ’tis very possible that Congress _may\r\nerr, may abuse, or misapply_ their powers, which no precaution of human\r\nwisdom can prevent.\r\n\r\n4. ’Tis _vain_, ’tis _childish_, ’tis _contentious_ to object to a\r\nconstitution thus framed and guarded, on pretence that the commonwealth\r\nmay suffer by a bad administration of it; or to _withhold_ the\r\n_necessary powers_ of government, from the supreme rulers of it, least\r\nthey should _abuse_ or _misapply_ those powers. This is an objection\r\nwhich will operate with equal force against every institution that\r\ncan be made in this world, whether of policy, religion, commerce, or\r\nany other human concern, which can require regulations: for ’tis not\r\npossible to form any institution however necessary, wise and good,\r\nwhose uses may not be lessened or destroyed by bad management.\r\n\r\nIf Brutus, or any body else, can point out [14] any _checks_,\r\n_cautions_, or _regulations_, which have been hitherto omitted, which\r\nwill make Congress more _wise_, more _capable_, more _diligent_, or\r\nmore _faithful_, I am willing to attend to them. But to set Congress at\r\nthe head of the government, and object to their being vested with full\r\nand sufficient power to manage all the great departments of it, appears\r\nto me _absurd_, quite _wild_, and _chimerical_: it would produce a\r\nplan which would destroy itself as it went along, would be a sort of\r\ncounter position of contrary parts, and render it impossible for rulers\r\nto render those services, and secure those benefits to the States,\r\nwhich are the only great ends of their appointment.\r\n\r\nThe constitution under Brutus’s corrections would stand thus, _viz._\r\nCongress would have power to _raise money_, but must not direct the\r\n_quantity_, or _mode of levying_ it; they might raise _armies_, but\r\nmust not judge to the _number_ of soldiers necessary, or direct their\r\ndestination; they ought to provide for the _general welfare_, but must\r\nnot be judges of what that welfare _consists in_, or in _what manner_\r\n’tis to be provided for; they might controul the several States, for\r\n_defined national purposes_, but must not be judges of _what purposes_\r\nwould come within that _definition_, &c.\r\n\r\nAny body with half an eye, may see what sort of administration the\r\nconstitution, thus corrected, would produce, _e. g._ it would [15]\r\nrequire much greater trouble to leave the work _undone_, than would be\r\nnecessary to get it _well done_, under a constitution of sufficient\r\npowers. If any one wishes to view more minutely this blessed operation,\r\nhe may see a lively sample of it, in the last seven years practice of\r\nour federal government.\r\n\r\n5. Brutus all along sounds his objections, and fears on _extreme\r\ncases_ of abuse or misapplication of supreme powers, which may\r\n_possibly_ happen, under the administration of a wild, weak, or wicked\r\nCongress; but ’tis easy to observe that all institutions are liable to\r\n_extremes_, but ought not _to be judged by them_; they do not often\r\nappear, and perhaps never may; but if they should happen in the cases\r\nsupposed, (which God forbid) there is a remedy pointed out, in the\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\n’Tis not supposeable that such abuses could arise to any ruinous\r\nheight, before they would affect the States so much, that at least\r\ntwo-thirds of them would unite in pursuing a remedy in the mode\r\nprescribed by the Constitution, which will always be liable to\r\namendment, whenever any mischiefs or abuses appear in the government,\r\nwhich the Constitution in its present state, can’t reach and correct.\r\n\r\n6. Brutus thinks we can never be too much afraid of the encroaching\r\navidity of rulers; but ’tis pretty plain, that however great the\r\nnatural lust of power in rulers may be, the jealousy of the people\r\nin giving it, is about [16] equal; these two opposite passions, will\r\nalways operate in opposite directions to each other, and like _action_\r\nand _reaction_ in natural bodies, will ever tend to a good ballance.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the Congress can never get more power than the people will\r\ngive, nor hold it any longer than they will permit; for should they\r\nassume tyrannical powers, and make incroachments on liberty without the\r\nconsent of the people, they would soon attone for their temerity, with\r\nshame and disgrace, and probably with their heads.\r\n\r\nBut ’tis here to be noted, that all the danger does not arise from\r\nthe extreme of power in the rulers; for when the ballance verges to\r\nthe contrary extreme, and the power of the rulers becomes too much\r\nlimited and cramped, all the nerves of government are weakened, and the\r\nadministration must unavoidably sicken, and lose that energy which is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the support of the State, and the security of\r\nthe people. For ’tis a truth worthy of great attention, that laws are\r\nnot made so much for the righteous as for the wicked; who never fail\r\nto shelter themselves from punishment, whenever they can, under the\r\ndefects of the law, and the weakness of government.\r\n\r\nI now come to consider the grand proposition which Brutus sets out\r\nwith, concludes with, and interlards all along, and which [17] seems\r\nto be the great gift of his performance, viz. That a confederation of\r\nthe Thirteen States into one great republic is not best for them: and\r\ngoes on to prove by a variety of arguments, that a republican form of\r\ngovernment is not compatible, and cannot be convenient to so extensive\r\na territory as the said States possess. He begins by taking one\r\nassumption for granted (for I can’t see that his arguments prove it at\r\nall) _viz._ That the Constitution proposed will melt down and destroy\r\nthe jurisdiction of the particular States, and consolidate them all\r\ninto one great republic.\r\n\r\nI can’t see the least reason for this sentiment; nor the least\r\ntendency in the new Constitution to produce this effect. For the\r\nConstitution does not suffer the federal powers to controul in the\r\nleast, or so much as to interfere in the internal policy, jurisdiction,\r\nor municipal rights of any particular State: except where great and\r\nmanifest national purposes and interests make that controul necessary.\r\nIt appears very evident to me, that the Constitution gives an\r\nestablishment, support, and protection to the internal and separate\r\npolice of each State, under the superintendency of the federal powers,\r\nwhich it could not possibly enjoy in an independent state. Under the\r\nconfederation each State derives strength, firmness and permanency from\r\nits compact with the other States. Like a stave in a cask well bound\r\nwith hoops, it [18] stands firmer, is not so easily shaken, bent, or\r\nbroken, as it would be were it set up by itself alone, without any\r\nconnection with its neighbours.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that each State will receive from the union\r\ngreat support and protection against the invasions and inroads of\r\nforeign enemies, as well as against riots and insurrections of their\r\nown citizens; and of consequence, the course of their internal\r\nadministration will be secured by this means against any interruption\r\nor embarrassment from either of these causes.\r\n\r\nThey will also derive their share of benefit from the respectability\r\nof the union abroad, from the treaties and alliances which may be made\r\nwith foreign nations, &c.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit they will receive from the controul of the supreme\r\npower of the union is this, viz. they will be restrained from making\r\nangry, oppressive, and destructive laws, from declaring ruinous wars\r\nwith their neighbours, from fomenting quarrels and controversies, &c.\r\nall which ever weaken a state, tend to its fatal disorder, and often\r\nend in its dissolution. Righteousness exalts and strengthens a nation;\r\nbut sin is a reproach and weakening of any people.\r\n\r\nThey will indeed have the privilege of oppressing their own citizens\r\nby bad laws or bad administration; but the moment the mischief extends\r\nbeyond their own State, and [19] begins to affect the citizens of other\r\nStates, strangers, or the national welfare,—the salutary controul\r\nof the supreme power will check the evil, and restore strength and\r\nsecurity, as well as honesty and right, to the offending state.\r\n\r\nIt appears then very plain, that the natural effect and tendency of\r\nthe supreme powers of the union is to give strength, establishment,\r\nand permanency to the internal police and jurisdiction of each of the\r\nparticular States; not to melt down and destroy, but to support and\r\nconfirm them all.\r\n\r\nBy what sort of assurance, then, can Brutus tell us that the new\r\nConstitution, if executed, must certainly and infallibly terminate in a\r\nconsolidation of the whole, into one great republic, subverting all the\r\nState authorities. His only argument is, that the federal powers may be\r\ncorrupted, abused, and misapplied, ’till this effect shall be produced.\r\n’Tis true that the constitution, like every other on earth, committed\r\nto human management, may be corrupted by a bad administration, and be\r\nmade to operate to the destruction of the very capital benefits and\r\nuses, which were the great end of its institution. The same argument\r\nwill prove with equal cogency, that the constitution of each particular\r\nState, may be corrupted in practice, become tyranical and inimical to\r\nliberty. In short the argument proves too much, and therefore proves\r\nnothing: [20] ’tis empty, childish, and futile, and a serious proposal\r\nof it, is, I conceive, an affront to the human understanding.\r\n\r\nBut after all, supposing this event should take place, and by some\r\nstrange fatality, the several states should be melted down, and merged\r\nin the great commonwealth, in the form of counties, or districts;\r\nI don’t see why a commonwealth mode of government, would not be\r\nas suitable and convenient for the great State, as any other form\r\nwhatever; I cannot see any sufficient ground or reason, for the\r\nposition pretty often and boldly advanced, that a republican form of\r\ngovernment can never be suitable for any nation of extensive territory,\r\nand numerous population: for if Congress can be chosen by the several\r\nStates, though under the form and name of counties, or election\r\ndistricts, and be in every respect, instituted as directed by the new\r\nconstitution, I don’t see but we shall have as suitable a national\r\ncouncil, as wise a legislative, and as strong and safe an executive\r\npower, as can be obtained under any form of government whatever; let\r\nour territory be ever so extensive or populous.\r\n\r\nThe most despotic monarch that can exist, must have his councils, and\r\nofficers of state; and I can’t see any one circumstance of their being\r\nappointed under a monarchy, that can afford any chance of their being\r\nany wiser or better, than ours may be. ’Tis true indeed, [21] the\r\ndespot may, if he pleases, act without any advice at all; but when he\r\ndoes so, I conceive it will be very rare that the nation will receive\r\ngreater advantages from his unadvised edicts, than may be drawed from\r\nthe deliberate acts and orders of our supreme powers. All that can be\r\nsaid in favour of those, is, that they will have less chance of delay,\r\nand more of secrecy, than these; but I think it probable, that the\r\nlatter will be grounded on better information, and greater wisdom; will\r\ncarry more weights and be better supported.\r\n\r\nThe Romans rose, from small beginnings, to a very great extent of\r\nterritory, population, and wisdom; I don’t think their constitution of\r\ngovernment, was near so good as the one proposed to us, yet we find\r\ntheir power, strength, and establishment, were raised to their utmost\r\nheight, under a republican form of government. Their State received\r\nvery little acquisition of territory, strength, or wealth, after their\r\ngovernment became imperial; but soon began to weaken and decay.\r\n\r\nThe Carthagenians acquired an amazing degree of strength, wealth, and\r\nextent of dominion, under a republican form of government. Neither\r\nthey or the Romans, owed their dissolution to any causes arising from\r\nthat kind of government: ’twas the party rage, animosity, and violence\r\nof their citizens, which destroyed them both; it weakened them, ’till\r\nthe [22] one fell under the power of their enemy, and was thereby\r\nreduced to ruin; the other changed their form of government, to a\r\nmonarchy, which proved in the end, equally fatal to them.\r\n\r\nThe same causes, if they can’t be restrained, will weaken or destroy\r\nany nation on earth, let their form of government be what it will;\r\nwitness the division and dissolution of the Roman empire; the late\r\ndismemberment of Poland; the intestine divisions, rage, and wars of\r\nItaly, of France, of Spain, and of England.\r\n\r\nNo form of government can preserve a nation which can’t controul the\r\nparty rage of its own citizens; when any one citizen can rise above the\r\ncontroul of the laws, ruin draws near. ’Tis not possible for any nation\r\non earth, to hold their strength and establishment, when the dignity of\r\ntheir government is lost, and this dignity will forever depend on the\r\nwisdom and firmness of the officers of government, aided and supported\r\nby the virtue and patriotism of their citizens.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I don’t see but that any form of government may be\r\nsafe and practicable, where the controuling authority of the supreme\r\npowers, is strong enough to effect the ends of its appointment, and at\r\nthe same time, sufficiently checked to keep it within due bounds, and\r\nlimit it to the objects of its duty; and I think it appears, that the\r\nconstitution proposed to us, has all these qualities [23] in as great\r\nperfection, as any form we can devise.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the grand secret of forming a good government, is, to\r\nput good men into the administration: for wild, vicious, or idle men,\r\nwill ever make a bad government, let its principles be ever so good;\r\nbut grave, wise, and faithful men, acting under a good constitution,\r\nwill afford the best chances of security, peace, and prosperity, to the\r\nthe citizens, which can be derived from civil police, under the present\r\ndisorders, and uncertainty of all earthly things.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Nov. 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n FINIS.\r\n\r\nAn / Examination / of the / Constitution / for the / United States / of\r\n/ America, / Submitted to the People / by the / General Convention, /\r\nAt Philadelphia, the 17th Day of September, 1787, / and since adopted\r\nand ratified / by the / Conventions of Eleven States, / chosen for the\r\npurpose of considering it, being all / that have yet decided on the\r\nsubject. / By an American Citizen. / To which is added, / A Speech /\r\nof the / Honorable James Wilson, Esquire, / on the same subject. /\r\nPhiladelphia: / Printed by Zachariah Poulson, Junr. in Fourth-/ Street,\r\nbetween Market and Arch-Street. / M.DCC.LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n  8vo., pp. 33.\r\n\r\n  “An American Citizen” was the pseudonym of Tench Coxe, of\r\n  Pennsylvania, a member of the Annapolis Convention and the\r\n  Continental Congress, and author of a number of pamphlets on the\r\n  finances and commerce of the United States.

L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nCANDID READER.\r\n\r\nEvery person, who desires to know _the true situation_ of the United\r\nStates of America, in regard to _the freedom and powers_ of their\r\ngovernments, must carefully consider together the _constitution of the\r\nstate_ in which he lives and _the new constitution of fœderal or\r\ngeneral government_. The _latter alone_ is treated of in the following\r\npages. The former, it is presumed, are sufficiently understood by the\r\ncitizens who live under them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER I.\r\n\r\n  _On the Federal Government, and first on the safety of the people,\r\n  from the restraints imposed on the President._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for an honest and feeling mind, of any nation or\r\ncountry whatever, to be insensible to the present circumstances of\r\nAmerica. Were I an East Indian, or a Turk, I should consider this\r\nsingular situation of a part of my fellow creatures as the most curious\r\nand interesting. Intimately connected with the country, as a citizen of\r\nthe union, I confess it entirely engrosses my mind and feelings.\r\n\r\nTo take a proper view of the ground on which we stand, it may be\r\nnecessary to recollect the manner in which the United States were\r\noriginally settled and [4] established. Want of charity in the\r\nreligious systems of Europe, and of justice in their political\r\ngovernments, were the principal moving causes, which drove the\r\nemigrants of various countries to the American continent. The\r\nCongregationalists, Quakers, Presbyterians and other British\r\ndissenters, the Catholics of England and Ireland, the Hugonots of\r\nFrance, the German Lutherans, Calvinists and Moravians, with several\r\nother societies, established themselves in the different colonies,\r\nthereby laying the ground of that liberality in ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nwhich has been observable since the late revolution. Religious\r\nliberty naturally promotes corresponding dispositions in matters of\r\ngovernment. The constitution of England as it stood on paper, was one\r\nof the freest, at that time, in the world, and the American colonies\r\nconsidered themselves as entitled to the fullest enjoyment of it.\r\nThus, when the ill-judged discussions of late times in England brought\r\ninto question the rights of this country, as it stood connected with\r\nthe British crown, we were found more strongly impressed with their\r\nimportance, and accurately acquainted with their extent, than the\r\nwisest and most learned of our brethren beyond the Atlantic. When\r\nthe greatest names in parliament insisted on the power of that body\r\nover the commerce of the colonies, and even the right to bind us in\r\nall cases whatsoever, America, seeing that it was only another form\r\nof tyranny, insisted upon the immutable truth, that taxation and\r\nrepresentation are inseparable; and, while a desire of harmony and\r\nother considerations induced her into an acquiescence in the commercial\r\nrelations of Great Britain, it was done from the declared necessity\r\nof the case, and with a cautious, full, and absolute saving of our\r\nvoluntarily-suspended rights. The parliament was persevering, and\r\nAmerica continued firm, till hostilities and open war commenced, and\r\nfinally the late revolution closed the contest forever.\r\n\r\n[5] It is evident, from this short detail, and the reflections which\r\narise from it, that the quarrel between the United States and the\r\nparliament of Great Britain did not arise so much from objections to\r\nthe form of government, though undoubtedly a better one by far is now\r\nwithin our reach, as from a difference concerning certain important\r\nrights, resulting from the essential principles of liberty, which their\r\nconstitution actually preserved to all the subjects residing within the\r\nrealm. It was not asserted by America, that the people of the island of\r\nGreat Britain were slaves, but that we, though possessed absolutely of\r\nthe same rights, were not admitted to enjoy an equal degree of freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen the declaration of independence compleated the separation between\r\nthe two countries, new governments were necessarily established.\r\nMany circumstances led to the adoption of the republican form, among\r\nwhich was the predilection of the people. In devising the frames of\r\ngovernment, it may have been difficult to avoid extremes opposite to\r\nthe vices of that we had just rejected; nevertheless, many of the state\r\nconstitutions we have chosen are truly excellent. Our misfortunes have\r\nbeen, that in the first instance we adopted no national government at\r\nall; but were kept together by common danger only; and that in the\r\nconfusions of a civil war, we framed a fœderal constitution, now\r\nuniversally admitted to be inadequate to the preservation of liberty,\r\nproperty, and the union. The question is not, then, how far our state\r\nconstitutions are good, or otherwise—the object of our wishes is,\r\nto amend and supply the evident and allowed errors and defects of\r\nthe fœderal government. Let us consider awhile, that which is now\r\nproposed to us—let us compare it with the so much boasted British form\r\nof government, and see how much more it favours the people, and how\r\ncompletely it secures their rights, remembering, at the same time, that\r\nwe did not dissolve our connection [6] with that country so much on\r\naccount of its constitution, as the perversion and mal-administration\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us look at the nature and powers of the head of\r\nthat country, and those of the ostensible head of ours.\r\n\r\nThe British king is the great bishop or supreme head of an established\r\nchurch, with an immense patronage annexed. In this capacity he commands\r\na number of votes in the house of lords, by creating bishops, who,\r\nbesides their great incomes, have votes in that assembly, and are\r\njudges in the last resort. These prelates have also many honorable\r\nand lucrative places to bestow, and thus from their wealth, learning,\r\ndignities, powers, and patronage, give a great lustre and an enormous\r\ninfluence to the crown.\r\n\r\nIn America, our president will not only be without these influencing\r\nadvantages, but they will be in the possession of the people at large,\r\nto strengthen their hands in the event of a contest with him. All\r\nreligious funds, honors and powers, are in the gift of numberless\r\nunconnected, disunited and contending corporations, wherein the\r\nprinciple of perfect equality universally prevails. In short, danger\r\nfrom ecclesiastical tyranny, that long standing and still remaining\r\ncurse of the people—that sacreligious engine of royal power in some\r\ncountries—can be feared by no man in the United States. In Britain\r\ntheir king is for life—in America, our President will always be one\r\nof the people at the end of four years. In that country, the king is\r\nhereditary, and may be an idiot, a knave, or a tyrant by nature, or\r\nignorant from neglect of his education, yet cannot be removed, for “he\r\ncan do no wrong.” This is a favorite maxim of their constitution. In\r\nAmerica, as the President is to be one of the people at the end of\r\nhis short term, so will he and his fellow citizens remember, that he\r\nwas originally one of the people; and he is created by their breath.\r\nFurther, he cannot be [7] an idiot, probably not a knave or tyrant, for\r\nthose whom nature makes so discover it before the age of thirty-five,\r\nuntil which period he cannot be elected. It appears, we have not\r\nadmitted that he can do no wrong, but have rather pre-supposed he may,\r\nand sometimes will do wrong, by providing for his impeachment, his\r\ntrial, and his peaceable and complete removal.\r\n\r\nIn England the king has a power to create members of the upper\r\nhouse, who are judges in the highest court, as well as legislators.\r\nOur President not only cannot make members of the Senate, but\r\ntheir creation, like his own, is by the people, through their\r\nrepresentatives: and a member of Assembly may and will be as certainly\r\ndismissed at the end of his year, for electing a weak or wicked\r\nSenator, as for any other blunder or misconduct.\r\n\r\nThe king of England has complete legislative power, while our President\r\ncan only use it when the other servants of the people are divided. But\r\nin all great cases affecting the national interests or safety, his\r\nmodified and restrained power must give way to the sense of two-thirds\r\nof the legislature. In fact it amounts to no more, than a serious duty\r\nimposed upon him to request both houses to reconsider any matter on\r\nwhich he entertains doubts or feels apprehensions; and here the people\r\nhave a strong hold upon him from his sole and personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe President of the upper-house (or the chancellor) in England, is\r\nappointed by their king, while our Vice-President, who is chosen by the\r\npeople, through the electors and the Senate, is not at all dependant\r\non the President, but may exercise equal powers on some occasions. In\r\nall royal governments, an helpless infant or an inexperienced youth\r\nmay wear the crown. Our President must be matured by the experience of\r\nyears, and being born among us, his character at thirty-five must be\r\nfully understood. Wisdom, virtue and [8]active qualities of mind and\r\nbody can alone make him the first servant of a free and enlightened\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOur President will fall very much short indeed of any prince in his\r\nannual income, which will not be hereditary, but the absolute allowance\r\nof the people, passing through the hands of their other servants\r\nfrom year to year, as it becomes necessary. There will be no burdens\r\non the nation, to provide for his heir, or other branches of his\r\nfamily. It is probable, from the state of property in America, and\r\nother circumstances, that many citizens will exceed him in show and\r\nexpense,—those dazzling trappings of kingly rank and power. He will\r\nhave no authority to make a treaty, without two-thirds of the senate,\r\nnor can he appoint ambassadors or other great officers without their\r\napprobation, which will remove the idea of patronage and influence,\r\nand of personal obligation and dependence. The appointment of even the\r\ninferior officers may be taken out of his hands by an act of congress\r\nat any time; he can create no nobility or titles of honor, nor take\r\naway offices during good behaviour. His person is not so much protected\r\nas that of a member of the house of representatives; for he may be\r\nproceeded against like any other man in the ordinary course of law. He\r\nappoints no officer of the separate states. He will have no influence\r\nfrom placemen in the legislature, nor can he prorogue or dissolve it.\r\nHe will have no power over the treasures of the state; and, lastly, as\r\nhe is created through the electors, by the people at large, he must\r\never look up to the support of his creators. From such a servant, with\r\npowers so limited and transitory, there can be no danger, especially\r\nwhen we consider the solid foundations on which our national liberties\r\nare immoveably fixed, by the other provisions of this excellent\r\nconstitution. Whatever of dignity or authority he possesses, is a\r\ndelegated part of their majesty and their political omnipotence,\r\ntransiently vested in him by the people themselves, for their own\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] NUMBER II.\r\n\r\n  _On the safety of the people, from the restraints imposed upon the\r\n  Senate._\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the late honorable convention, in designating the\r\nnature of the chief executive office of the United States, having\r\ndeprived it of all the dangerous appendages of royalty, and provided\r\nfor the frequent expiration of its limited powers—As our president\r\nbears no resemblance to a king, so we shall see the senate have no\r\nsimilitude to nobles.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, not being hereditary, their collective knowledge, wisdom,\r\nand virtue are not precarious, for by these qualities alone they are to\r\nobtain their offices; and they will have none of the peculiar follies\r\nand vices of those men, who possess power merely because their fathers\r\nheld it before them, for they will be educated (under equal advantages,\r\nand with equal prospects) among and on a footing with the other sons\r\nof a free people. If we recollect the characters, who have, at various\r\nperiods, filled the seats of congress, we shall find this expectation\r\nperfectly reasonable. Many young men of genius, and many characters of\r\nmore matured abilities without fortunes, have been honored with that\r\ntrust. Wealth has had but few representatives there, and those have\r\nbeen generally possessed of respectable personal qualifications. There\r\nhave also been many instances of persons not eminently endowed with\r\nmental qualities, who have been sent thither from a reliance on their\r\nvirtues, public and private—As the senators are still to be elected by\r\nthe legislatures of the states, there can be no doubt of equal safety\r\nand propriety in their future appointment, especially as no further\r\npecuniary qualification is required by the constitution.\r\n\r\n[10] They can hold no other office civil or military under the United\r\nStates, nor can they join in making provision for themselves, either\r\nby creating new places, or encreasing the emoluments of old ones. As\r\ntheir sons are not to succeed them, they will not be induced to aim\r\nat an increase or perpetuity of their powers, at the expence of the\r\nliberties of the people, of which those sons will be a part. They\r\npossess a much smaller share of the judicial power than the upper house\r\nin Britain, for they are not, as there, the highest court in civil\r\naffairs. Impeachments alone are the cases cognizable before them, and\r\nin what other place could matters of that nature be so properly and\r\nsafely determined? The judges of the fæderal courts will owe their\r\nappointments to the president and senate, therefore may not feel so\r\nperfectly free from favour, affection and influence, as the upper\r\nhouse who receive the power from the people, through their state\r\nrepresentatives, and are immediately responsible to those assemblies,\r\nand finally to the nation at large—Thus we see, when a daring or\r\ndangerous offender is brought to the bar of public justice, the\r\npeople, who alone can impeach him by their immediate representatives,\r\nwill cause him to be tried, not by judges appointed in the heat of\r\nthe occasion, but by two-thirds of a select body, chosen a long time\r\nbefore, for various purposes, by the collective wisdom of their State\r\nlegislatures. From a pretence or affectation of extraordinary purity\r\nand excellence of character, their word of honour is the sanction\r\nunder which these high courts, in other countries, have given their\r\nsentence—But with us, like the other judges of the union, like the\r\nrest of the people, of which they are never to forget they are a part,\r\nit is required that they be on oath.\r\n\r\nNo ambitious, undeserving or inexperienced youth can acquire a seat\r\nin this house by means of the most enormous wealth, or most powerful\r\nconnections, till [11] thirty years have ripened his abilities, and\r\nfully discovered his merits to his country—a more rational ground of\r\npreference surely than mere property.\r\n\r\nThe senate, though more independent of the people, as to the\r\nfree exercise of their judgment and abilities, than the house of\r\nrepresentatives, by the longer term of their office, must be older and\r\nmore experienced men, and are vested with less effective power; for\r\nthe public treasures, the sinews of the state, cannot be called forth\r\nby their original motion. They may indeed restrain the profusion or\r\nerrors of the house of representatives, but they cannot take any of\r\nthe necessary measures to raise a national revenue.\r\n\r\nThe people, through the electors, prescribe them such a president as\r\nshall be best qualified to controul them.\r\n\r\nThey can only, by conviction or impeachment, remove and incapacitate\r\na dangerous officer, but the punishment of him as a criminal remains\r\nwithin the province of the courts of law, to be conducted under all\r\nthe ordinary forms and precautions, which exceedingly diminishes the\r\nimportance of their judicial powers. They are detached, as much as\r\npossible, from local prejudices in favor of their respective states,\r\nby having a separate and independent vote, for the sensible and\r\nconscientious use of which every member will find his person, honor and\r\ncharacter seriously bound—He cannot shelter himself, under a vote in\r\nbehalf of his state, among his immediate colleagues.\r\n\r\nAs there are only two, he cannot be voluntarily or involuntarily\r\ngoverned by the majority of the deputation—He will be obliged, by\r\nwholesome provisions, to attend his public duty, and thus in great\r\nnational questions must give a vote, of the honesty of which he will\r\nfind it is necessary to convince his constituents.\r\n\r\nThe senate must always receive the exceptions of the president against\r\nany of their legislative acts, which, without [12] serious deliberation\r\nand sufficient reasons, they will seldom disregard. They will also\r\nfeel a considerable check from the constitutional powers of the state\r\nlegislatures, whose rights they will not be disposed to infringe, since\r\nthey are the bodies to which they owe their existence, and are moreover\r\nto remain the immediate guardians of the people.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the Senate will feel the mighty check of the House of\r\nRepresentatives—a body so truly popular and pure in its election, so\r\nintimately connected, by its interests and feelings, with the people at\r\nlarge, so guarded against corruption and influence—so much, from its\r\nnature, above all apprehensions, that it must ever be able to maintain\r\nthe high ground assigned to it by the fæderal constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER III.\r\n\r\n  _On the safety of the people, from the nature of the House of\r\n  Representatives._\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the consideration of the new fœderal constitution,\r\nit remains now to examine the nature and powers of the House of\r\nRepresentatives—the immediate delegates of the people.\r\n\r\nEach member of this truly popular assembly will be chosen by about\r\nsix thousand electors, by the poor as well as the rich. No decayed or\r\nvenal borough will have an unjust share in their determinations—no\r\nold Sarum will send thither a representative by the voice of a single\r\nelector.(35) As we shall have no royal ministers to purchase votes,\r\nso we shall have no votes for sale; for the suffrages of six thousand\r\nenlightened and independent freemen are above all price. When the\r\nincreasing population of the country shall render the body too [13]\r\nlarge at the rate of one member for every thirty thousand persons, they\r\nwill be returned at the greater rate of one for every forty or fifty\r\nthousand, which will render the electors still more incorruptible.\r\nFor this regulation is only designed to prevent a smaller number than\r\nthirty thousand from having a representative. Thus we see a provision\r\nfollows, that no state shall have less than one member, for if a new\r\nand greater number than thirty thousand should hereafter be fixed on,\r\nwhich should exceed the whole of the inhabitants of any state, such\r\nstate, without this wholesome provision, would lose its voice in the\r\nHouse of Representatives—a circumstance which the constitution renders\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe people of England, whose House of commons is filled with military\r\nand civil officers and pensioners, say their liberties would be\r\nperfectly secured by triennial Parliaments. With us no placeman\r\ncan sit among the representatives of the people, and two years\r\nare the constitutional term of their existence. Here, again, lest\r\nwealth, powerful connections, or even the unwariness of the people\r\nshould place in this important trust an undeserving, unqualified or\r\ninexperienced youth, the wisdom of the Convention has proposed an\r\nabsolute incapacity till the age of twenty-five. At twenty-one a\r\nyoung man is made the guardian of his own interest, but he cannot,\r\nfor a few years more be intrusted with the affairs of the nation. He\r\nmust be an inhabitant of the state that elects him, that he may be\r\nintimately acquainted with their particular circumstances—The house\r\nof Representatives is not, as the senate, to have a President chosen\r\nfor them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from\r\ntheir own number—They will also appoint all their other officers. In\r\ngreat state cases, they will be the grand inquest of the nation, for\r\nthey possess the sole and uncontroulable power of impeachment. They are\r\nneither to wait the call, nor abide the prorogations and dissolutions\r\n[14] of a perverse or ambitious Prince, for they are to meet at least\r\nonce in every year, and to sit on adjournments to be agreed on between\r\nthemselves and the other servants of the people. Should they differ\r\nin opinion, the President, who is a temporary fellow-servant, and not\r\ntheir hereditary master, has a mediatorial power to adjust it for\r\nthem, but cannot prevent their constitutional meeting within the year.\r\nThey can compel the attendance of their members, that their public\r\nduty may not be evaded in times of difficulty or danger—The vote of\r\neach representative can be always known, as well as the proceedings\r\nof the house, that so the people may be acquainted with the conduct\r\nof those in whom they repose so important a trust. As was observed\r\nof the Senators, they cannot make new offices for themselves, nor\r\nincrease, for their own benefit, the emoluments of old ones, by which\r\nthe people will be exempted from needless additions to the public\r\nexpences, on such sordid and mercenary principles—They are not to\r\nbe restrained from the firm and plain language, which becomes the\r\nindependent representatives of freedom, for there is to be a perfect\r\nliberty of speech. Without their consent, no monies can be obtained,\r\nno armies raised, no navies provided. They, alone, can originate bills\r\nfor drawing forth the revenues of the union, and they will have a\r\nnegative upon every legislative act of the other house.—So far, in\r\nshort, as the sphere of fœderal jurisdiction extends, they will be\r\ncontroulable only by the people, and, in contentions with the other\r\nbranch, so far as they shall be right, they must ever finally prevail.\r\n\r\nSuch, my Countrymen, are some of the cautionary provisions of the\r\nframe of government your faithful convention have submitted to your\r\nconsideration—such the foundations of peace, liberty and safety, which\r\nhave been laid by their unwearied labors—They have guarded you against\r\nall servants but those “whom choice and common good ordain,” against\r\nall masters, “save preserving Heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] NUMBER IV.\r\n\r\n  _The security for national safety and happiness, resulting from other\r\n  parts of the fœderal Government._\r\n\r\nIn considering the respective powers of the President, the Senate and\r\nthe House of Representatives, under the fœderal constitution, we\r\nhave seen a part of the wholesome precautions, which are contained in\r\nthe new system. Let us examine what further securities for the safety\r\nand happiness of the people are contained in the general stipulations\r\nand provisions.\r\n\r\nThe United States guarantee to every state in the union a separate\r\nrepublican form of government. From thence it follows, that any man or\r\nbody of men, however rich or powerful, who shall make an alteration in\r\nthe form of government of any state, whereby the powers thereof shall\r\nbe attempted to be taken out of the hands of the people at large,\r\nwill stand guilty of high treason; or should a foreign power seduce\r\nor over-awe the people of any state, so as to cause them to vest in\r\nthe families of any ambitious citizens or foreigners the powers of\r\nhereditary governors, whether as Kings or Nobles, that such investment\r\nof powers would be void in itself, and every person attempting to\r\nexecute them would also be guilty of treason.\r\n\r\nNo religious test is ever to be required of any officer or servant\r\nof the United States. The people may employ any wise or good citizen\r\nin the execution of the various duties of the government. In Italy,\r\nSpain, and Portugal, no protestant can hold a public trust. In England\r\nevery Presbyterian, and other person not of their established church,\r\nis incapable of holding an office. No such impious deprivation of the\r\nrights of men can take place under the new fœderal constitution. The\r\nconvention [16] has the honour of proposing the first public act, by\r\nwhich any nation has ever divested itself of a power, every exercise of\r\nwhich is a trespass on the Majesty of Heaven.\r\n\r\nNo qualification in monied or landed property is required by the\r\nproposed plan; nor does it admit any preference from the preposterous\r\ndistinctions of birth and rank. The office of the President, a Senator,\r\nand a Representative, and every other place of power or profit, are\r\ntherefore open to the whole body of the people. Any wise, informed and\r\nupright man, be his property what it may, can exercise the trusts and\r\npowers of the state, provided he possesses the moral, religious and\r\npolitical virtues which are necessary to secure the confidence of his\r\nfellow citizens.\r\n\r\nThe importation of slaves from any foreign country is, by a clear\r\nimplication, held up to the world as equally inconsistent with\r\nthe dispositions and the duties of the people of America. A solid\r\nfoundation is laid for exploding the principles of negro slavery, in\r\nwhich many good men of all parties in Pennsylvania, and throughout\r\nthe union, have already concurred. The temporary reservation of any\r\nparticular matter must ever be deemed an admission that it should be\r\ndone away. This appears to have been well understood. In addition\r\nto the arguments drawn from liberty, justice and religion, opinions\r\nagainst this practice, founded in sound policy, have no doubt been\r\nurged. Regard was necessarily paid to the peculiar situation of our\r\nsouthern fellow-citizens; but they, on the other hand, have not been\r\ninsensible of the delicate situation of our national character on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe people will remain, under the proposed constitution, the fountain\r\nof power and public honour. The President, the Senate, and the House\r\nof Representatives, will be the channels through which the stream [17]\r\nwill flow—but it will flow from the people, and from them only. Every\r\noffice, religious, civil and military will be either their immediate\r\ngift, or it will come from them through the hands of their servants.\r\nAnd this, as observed before, will be guaranteed to them under the\r\nstate constitution which they respectively approve; for they cannot be\r\nroyal forms, cannot be aristocratical, but must be republican.\r\n\r\nThe people of those states which have faithfully discharged their duty\r\nto the union will be no longer subjected alone to the weight of the\r\npublic debts. Proper arrangements will call forth the just proportion\r\nof their sister states, and our national character will again be as\r\nunstained as it was once exalted. Elevation to independence, with\r\nthe loss of our good name, is only to be conspicuous in disgrace.\r\nThe liberties of a people involved in debt are as uncertain as the\r\nliberty of an individual in the same situation. Their virtue is more\r\nprecarious. The unfortunate citizen must yield to the operation of\r\nthe laws, while a bankrupt nation too easy annihilates the sacred\r\nobligations of gratitude and honour, and becomes execrable and\r\ninfamous. I cannot refrain from reminding my fellow-citizens of our\r\nnear approach to that deplorable situation, which must be our miserable\r\ncondition, if the defects of the old confederation remain without\r\namendment. The proposed constitution will cure the evil, and restore us\r\nto our rank among mankind.\r\n\r\nLaws, made after the commission of the fact, have been a dreadful\r\nengine in the hands of tyrannical governors. Some of the most virtuous\r\nand shining characters in the world have been put to death, by laws\r\nformed to render them punishable, for parts of their conduct which\r\ninnocence permitted, and to which patriotism impelled them. These have\r\nbeen called ex post facto laws, and are exploded by the new system. If\r\na time of public contention shall hereafter arrive, [18] the firm and\r\nardent friends to liberty may know the length to which they can push\r\ntheir noble opposition, on the foundation of the laws. Should their\r\ncountry’s cause impel them further, they will be acquainted with the\r\nhazard, and using those arms which Providence has put into their hands,\r\nwill make a solemn appeal to “the power above.”\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the ancient republics was occasioned in every\r\ninstance by their being ignorant of a great political position, which\r\nwas left for America to discover and establish. Self-evident as\r\nthe truth appears, we find no friend to liberty in ancient Greece or\r\nRome asserting, that taxation and representation were inseparable.\r\nThe Roman citizens, proud of their own liberty, imposed, in the\r\nfreest times of the commonwealth, the most grievous burdens on their\r\nwretched provinces. At other times we find thousands of their citizens,\r\nthough residing within the walls of Rome, deprived of legislative\r\nrepresentatives. When America asserted the novel truth, Great Britain,\r\nthough boasting herself as alone free among the modern nations, denied\r\nit by her legislature, and endeavoured to refute it by her arms—the\r\nreasoning of tyrants. But the attempt was vain, for the voice of truth\r\nwas heard above the thunders of the war, and reached the ears of all\r\nnations. Henceforth the people of the earth will consider this position\r\nas the only rock on which they can found the temple of liberty, that\r\ntaxation and representation are inseparable. Our new constitution\r\ncarries it into execution on the most enlarged and liberal scale, for a\r\nRepresentative will be chosen by six thousand of his fellow-citizens, a\r\nSenator by half a sovereign state, a President by a whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe old fœderal constitution contained many of the same things,\r\nwhich from error or disingenuousness are urged against the new ones.\r\nNeither of them have a bill of rights, nor does either notice the\r\nliberty of the press, because they are already provided for by the [19]\r\nstate constitutions; and relating only to personal rights, they could\r\nnot be mentioned in a contract among foreign states.\r\n\r\nBoth the old and new fœderal constitutions, and indeed the\r\nconstitution of Pennsylvania, admit of courts in which no use is made\r\nof a jury. The board of property, the court of admiralty, and the high\r\ncourt of errors and appeals, in the state of Pennsylvania, as also the\r\ncourt of appeals under the old confederation, exclude juries. Trial\r\nby jury will therefore be in the express words of the Pennsylvania\r\nconstitution, “as heretofore,”—almost always used, though sometimes\r\nomitted. Trials for lands lying in any state between persons residing\r\nin such state, for bonds, notes, book debts, contracts, trespasses,\r\nassumptions, and all other matters between two or more citizens of any\r\nstate, will be held in the state courts by juries, as now. In these\r\ncases the fœderal courts cannot interfere.(36) But when a dispute\r\narises between the citizens of any state about lands lying out of the\r\nbounds thereof, or when a trial is to be had between the citizens of\r\nany state and those of another, or the government of another, the\r\nprivate citizen will not be obliged to go into a court constituted by\r\nthe state, with which, or with the citizens of which, his dispute is.\r\nHe can appeal to a disinterested fœderal court. This is surely a\r\ngreat advantage, and promises a fair trial, and an impartial judgment.\r\nThe trial by jury is not excluded in these fœderal courts. In all\r\ncriminal cases, where the property, liberty or life of the citizen is\r\nat stake, he has the benefit of a jury. If convicted on impeachment,\r\nwhich is never done by a jury in any country, he cannot be fined,\r\nimprisoned or punished, but only may be disqualified from doing\r\npublic mischief by losing his office, [20] and his capacity to hold\r\nanother. If the nature of his offence, besides its danger to his\r\ncountry, should be criminal in itself—should involve a charge of\r\nfraud, murder or treason—he may be tried for such crime, but cannot be\r\nconvicted without a jury. In trials about property in the fœderal\r\ncourts, which can only be as above stated, there is nothing in the\r\nnew constitution to prevent a trial by jury. No doubt it will be the\r\nmode in every case, wherein it is practicable. This will be adjusted\r\nby law, and it could not be done otherwise. In short, the sphere of\r\njurisdiction for the fœderal courts is limited, and that sphere only\r\nis subject to the regulations of our fœderal government. The known\r\nprinciples of justice, the attachment to trial by jury whenever it can\r\nbe used, the instructions of the state legislatures, the instructions\r\nof the people at large, the operation of the fœderal regulations\r\non the property of a president, a senator, a representative, a judge,\r\nas well as on that of a private citizen, will certainly render those\r\nregulations as favorable as possible to property; for life and\r\nliberty are put more than ever into the hands of the juries. Under\r\nthe present constitution of all the states, a public officer may be\r\ncondemned to imprisonment or death on impeachment, without a jury;\r\nbut the new fœderal constitution protects the accused, till he\r\nshall be convicted, from the hands of power, by rendering a jury the\r\nindispensible judges of all crimes.\r\n\r\nThe influence which foreign powers may attempt to exercise in our\r\naffairs was foreseen, and a wholesome provision has been made against\r\nit; for no person holding an office under the United States is\r\npermitted to enjoy any foreign honours, powers or emoluments.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of the people have been excited, perhaps by persons\r\nwith good intentions, about the powers of the new government to raise\r\nan army. Let us consider this point with moderation and candour. As\r\nenemies will sometimes insult us, invade our country [21] and capture\r\nour property, it is clear a power in our government to oppose, restrain\r\nor destroy them, is necessary to our honor, safety and existence. The\r\nmilitary should, however, be regarded with a watchful eye; for it is\r\na profession that is liable to dangerous perversion. But the powers\r\nvested in the fœderal government do not go the length which has been\r\nsaid. A standing army is not granted or intended, for there can be no\r\nprovision for its continuing three years, much less for its permanent\r\nestablishment. Two years are the utmost time for which the money can be\r\ngiven. It will be under all the restrictions which wisdom and jealousy\r\ncan suggest, and the original grant of the supplies must be made by\r\nthe House of representatives, the immediate delegates of the people.\r\nThe Senate and President, who also derive their power from the people,\r\nappoint the officers; and the heads of the departments, who must submit\r\ntheir accounts to the whole legislature, are to pay and provide them,\r\nas shall be directed by the laws that shall contain the conditions\r\nof the grant. The militia, who are in fact the effective part of the\r\npeople at large, will render many troops quite unnecessary. They will\r\nform a powerful check upon the regular troops, and will generally be\r\nsufficient to over-awe them—for our detached situation will seldom\r\ngive occasion to raise an army, though a few scattered companies may\r\noften be necessary. But whenever, even on the most obvious reasons,\r\nan army shall be raised, the several states will be called, by the\r\nnature of things, to attend to the condition of the militia. Republican\r\njealousy, the guardian angel of these states, will watch the motions of\r\nour military citizens, even though they will be the soldiers of a free\r\npeople. There is a wide difference however between the troops of such\r\ncommonwealths as ours, founded on equal and unalterable principles,\r\nand those of a regal government, where ambition and oppression are the\r\nprofession of the king. In the first case, a military officer is the\r\noccasional servant of the people, employed for their defence; in [22]\r\nthe second, he is the ever ready instrument to execute the schemes of\r\nconquest or oppression, with which the mind of his royal master may be\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nObservations have been made on the power given to the fœderal\r\nGovernment in regard to the elections of Representatives and Senators.\r\nThe regulations of these elections are, by the first part of the\r\nclause, to be prescribed by the state legislatures, who are certainly\r\nthe proper bodies, if they will always execute the duty. But in case\r\nthe union or the public safety should be endangered by an omission\r\nof this duty, as in the case of Rhode-Island, then the legislature\r\nof the United States can name for the people a convenient time, and\r\ndo other matters necessary to insure the free exercise of their\r\nright of election. The exception, in regard to the places of chusing\r\nSenators, was made from due respect to the sovereignty of the state\r\nlegislatures, who are to elect the senators, and whose place of meeting\r\nought not to be prescribed to them by any authority, except, indeed,\r\nas we always must, by the authority of the people. This power given to\r\nthe fœderal legislature is no more than what is possessed by the\r\ngovernments of all the states. The constitution of Pennsylvania permits\r\ntwo-thirds of such cities and counties, as shall elect representatives,\r\nto exercise all the powers of the General Assembly, “as fully and amply\r\nas if the whole were present,” should any part of the state neglect\r\nor refuse to perform their duty in this particular. In short, it is a\r\npower necessary to preserve the social compact of each state and the\r\nconfederation of the United States.\r\n\r\nBesides the securities for the liberties of the people arising\r\nout of the fœderal government, they are guarded by their state\r\nconstitutions, and by the nature of things in the separate states. The\r\nGovernor or President in each commonwealth, the Councils, Senates,\r\nAssemblies, Judges, Sheriffs, Grand and Pettit Juries, Officers of\r\nMilitia, Clergy and Lay Officers of all churches, state and county\r\nTreasurer, Prothonotaries, Registers, [23] Presidents and other\r\nofficers of Universities, Colleges and Academies, Wardens of ports\r\nand cities, Burgesses of towns, Commissioners of counties, County\r\nLieutenants, and many other officers of power and influence, will\r\nstill be chosen within each state, without any possible interference\r\nof the fœderal Government. The separate states will also choose all\r\nthe members of the legislative and executive branches of the United\r\nStates. The people at large in each state will choose their fœderal\r\nrepresentative, and, unless ordered otherwise by state legislatures,\r\nmay choose the electors of the President and Vice-President of the\r\nUnion. And lastly, the legislature of the state will have the election\r\nof the senate, as they have heretofore had of the Members of Congress.\r\nLet us then, with a candor worthy of the subject, ask ourselves,\r\nwhether it can be feared, that a majority of the Representatives, each\r\nof whom will be chosen by six thousand enlightened freemen, can betray\r\ntheir country?—Whether a majority of the Senate, each of whom will\r\nbe chosen by the legislature of a free, sovereign and independent\r\nstate, without any stipulations in favour of wealth or the contemptible\r\ndistinctions of birth or rank, and who will be closely observed by the\r\nstate legislatures, can destroy our liberties, controuled as they are\r\ntoo by the house of representatives? or whether a temporary, limited,\r\nexecutive officer, watched by the fœderal Representatives, by the\r\nSenate, by the state legislatures, by his personal enemies among the\r\npeople of his own state, by the jealousy of the people of rival states,\r\nand by the whole of the people of the Union, can ever endanger our\r\nFreedom.(37)\r\n\r\n[24] Permit me, my fellow-citizens, to close these observations by\r\nremarking, that there is no spirit of arrogance in the new fœderal\r\nconstitution. It addresses you with becoming modesty, admitting that\r\nit may contain errors. Let us give it a trial; and when experience\r\nhas taught its mistakes, the people, whom it preserves absolutely\r\nall powerful, can reform and amend them. That I may be perfectly\r\nunderstood, I will acknowledge its acceptance by all the states,\r\nwithout delay, is the second wish of my heart. The first is, that our\r\ncountry may be virtuous and free.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.\r\n\r\n  SUBSTANCE OF AN ADDRESS\r\n  TO A\r\n  MEETING OF THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA,\r\n  DELIVERED, OCTOBER SIXTH, MDCCLXXXVII,\r\n\r\n  BY THE HONORABLE\r\n  JAMES WILSON, ESQUIRE,\r\n\r\n  ONE OF THE DE EGATES FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA TO THE\r\n  LATE CONTINENTAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman and Fellow Citizens_,\r\n\r\nHaving received the honour of an appointment to represent you in the\r\nlate convention, it is, perhaps, my duty to comply with the request of\r\nmany gentlemen, whose characters and judgments I sincerely respect,\r\nand who have urged that this would be a proper occasion to lay before\r\nyou any information, which will serve to elucidate and explain the\r\nprinciples and arrangements of the constitution- [26] that has been\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of the United States. I confess that I\r\nam unprepared for so extensive and so important a disquisition: but the\r\ninsidious attempts, which are clandestinely and industriously made to\r\npervert and destroy the new plan, induce me the more readily to engage\r\nin its defence: and the impressions of four months constant attendance\r\nto the subject, have not been so easily effaced, as to leave me without\r\nan answer to the objections which have been raised.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper, however, before I enter into the refutation of the\r\ncharges that are alleged, to mark the leading discrimination between\r\nthe state constitutions, and the constitution of the United States.\r\nWhen the people established the powers of legislation under their\r\nseparate governments, they invested their representatives with every\r\nright and authority which they did not in explicit terms reserve: and\r\ntherefore upon every question, respecting the jurisdiction of the house\r\nof assembly, if the frame of government is silent, the jurisdiction is\r\nefficient and complete. But in delegating fœderal powers, another\r\ncriterion was necessarily introduced: and the congressional authority\r\nis to be collected, not from tacit implication, but from the positive\r\ngrant, expressed in the instrument of union. Hence, it is evident, that\r\nin the former case, everything which is not reserved, is given: but in\r\nthe latter, the reverse of the proposition prevails, and every thing\r\nwhich is not given, is reserved. This distinction being recognized,\r\nwill furnish an answer to those who think the omission of a bill of\r\nrights, a defect in the proposed constitution: for it would have been\r\nsuperfluous and absurd, to have stipulated with a fœderal body of\r\nour own creation, that we should enjoy those privileges, of which we\r\nare not divested either by the intention or the act that has brought\r\nthat body into existence. For instance, the liberty of the [27] press,\r\nwhich has been a copious subject of declamation and opposition: what\r\ncontroul can proceed from the fœderal government, to shackle or\r\ndestroy that sacred palladium of national freedom? If, indeed, a\r\npower similar to that which has been granted for the regulation of\r\ncommerce, had been granted to regulate literary publications, it\r\nwould have been as necessary to stipulate that the liberty of the\r\npress should be preserved inviolate, as that the impost should be\r\ngeneral in its operation. With respect, likewise, to the particular\r\ndistrict of ten miles, which is to be the seat of government, it will\r\nundoubtedly be proper to observe this salutary precaution, as there\r\nthe legislative power will be vested in the president, senate, and\r\nhouse of representatives of the United States. But this could not be an\r\nobject with the convention: for it must naturally depend upon a future\r\ncompact; to which the citizens immediately interested, will, and ought\r\nto be parties: and there is no reason to suspect, that so popular a\r\nprivilege will in that case be neglected. In truth, then, the proposed\r\nsystem possesses no influence whatever upon the press; and it would\r\nhave been merely nugatory, to have introduced a formal declaration upon\r\nthe subject; nay, that very declaration might have been construed to\r\nimply that some degree of power was given, since we undertook to define\r\nits extent.\r\n\r\nAnother objection that has been fabricated against the new\r\nconstitution, is expressed in this disingenuous form—“the trial\r\nby jury is abolished in civil cases.” I must be excused, my fellow\r\ncitizens, if, upon this point, I take advantage of my professional\r\nexperience, to detect the futility of the assertion. Let it be\r\nremembered, then, that the business of the fœderal constitution was\r\nnot local, but general—not limited to the views and establishments\r\nof a single state, but co-extensive with the continent, and\r\ncomprehending the [28] views and establishments of thirteen independent\r\nsovereignties. When, therefore, this subject was in discussion, we were\r\ninvolved in difficulties, which pressed on all sides, and no precedent\r\ncould be discovered to direct our course. The cases open to a jury,\r\ndiffered in the different states; it was therefore impracticable,\r\non that ground, to have made a general rule. The want of uniformity\r\nwould have rendered any reference to the practice of the states idle\r\nand useless: and it could not, with any propriety, be said, that “the\r\ntrial by jury shall be as heretofore:” since there has never existed\r\nany fœderal system of jurisprudence, to which the declaration\r\ncould relate. Besides, it is not in all cases that the trial by\r\njury is adopted in civil questions: for causes depending in courts\r\nof admiralty, such as relate to maritime captures, and such as are\r\nagitated in the courts of equity, do not require the intervention of\r\nthat tribunal. How, then, was the line of discrimination to be drawn?\r\nThe convention found the task too difficult for them: and they left\r\nthe business as it stands—in the fullest confidence, that no danger\r\ncould possibly ensue, since the proceedings of the supreme court are\r\nto be regulated by the congress, which is a faithful representation of\r\nthe people: and the oppression of government is effectually barred,\r\nby declaring that in all criminal cases, the trial by jury shall be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThis constitution, it has been further urged, is of a pernicious\r\ntendency, because it tolerates a standing army in the time of peace.\r\nThis has always been a popular topic of declamation: and yet I do not\r\nknow a nation in the world, which has not found it necessary and useful\r\nto maintain the appearance of strength in a season of the most profound\r\ntranquility. Nor is it a novelty with us; for under the present\r\narticles of confederation, congress certainly possesses this reprobated\r\npower: and the exercise of it is proved at this [29] moment by the\r\ncantonments along the banks of the Ohio. But what would be our national\r\nsituation, where it otherwise? Every principle of policy must be\r\nsubverted, and the government must declare war before they are prepared\r\nto carry it on. Whatever may be the provocation, however important\r\nthe object in view, and however necessary dispatch and secrecy may\r\nbe, still the declaration must precede the preparation, and the enemy\r\nwill be informed of your intention, not only before you are equipped\r\nfor an attack, but even before you are fortified for a defence. The\r\nconsequence is too obvious to require any further delineation; and\r\nno man, who regards the dignity and safety of his country, can deny\r\nthe necessity of a military force, under the controul, and with the\r\nrestrictions which the new constitution provides.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there never was a charge made with less reason, than that which\r\npredicts the institution of a baneful aristocracy in the fœderal\r\nsenate. This body branches into two characters, the one legislative,\r\nand the other executive. In its legislative character, it can effect\r\nno purpose without the co-operation of the house of representatives:\r\nand in its executive character, it can accomplish no object, without\r\nthe concurrence of the president. Thus fettered, I do not know any act\r\nwhich the senate can of itself perform: and such dependence necessarily\r\nprecludes every idea of influence and superiority. But I will confess,\r\nthat in the organization of this body, a compromise between contending\r\ninterests is discernible: and when we reflect how various are the laws,\r\ncommerce, habits, population, and extent of the confederated states,\r\nthis evidence of mutual concession and accommodation ought rather to\r\ncommand a generous applause, than to excite jealousy and reproach. For\r\nmy part, my admiration can only be equalled by my astonishment, in\r\nbeholding so perfect a system formed from such heterogeneous materials.\r\n\r\n[30] The next accusation I shall consider, is that which represents the\r\nfœderal constitution as not only calculated, but designedly framed,\r\nto reduce the state governments to mere corporations, and eventually\r\nto annihilate them. Those who have employed the term corporation,\r\nupon this occasion, are not perhaps aware of its extent. In common\r\nparlance, indeed, it is generally applied to petty associations for\r\nthe ease and conveniency of a few individuals; but in its enlarged\r\nsense, it will comprehend the government of Pennsylvania, the existing\r\nunion of the states, and even this projected system is nothing more\r\nthan a formal act of incorporation. But upon what pretence can it be\r\nalleged that it was designed to annihilate the state governments?\r\nFor, I will undertake to prove that upon their existence depends the\r\nexistence of the fœderal plan. For this purpose, permit me to call\r\nyour attention to the manner in which the president, senate, and house\r\nof representatives, are proposed to be appointed. The president is to\r\nbe chosen by electors, nominated in such manner as the legislature of\r\neach state may direct; so that if there is no legislature, there can be\r\nno senate. The house of representatives is to be composed of members\r\nchosen every second year by the people of the several states, and the\r\nelectors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite to\r\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature—unless,\r\ntherefore, there is a state legislature, that qualification cannot be\r\nascertained, and the popular branch of the fœderal constitution must\r\nlikewise be extinct. From this view, then, it is evidently absurd to\r\nsuppose, that the annihilation of the separate governments will result\r\nfrom their union; or, that, having that intention, the authors of the\r\nnew system would have bound their connection with such indissoluble\r\nties. Let me here advert to an arrangement highly advantageous; for\r\nyou will perceive, with- [31] out prejudice to the powers of the\r\nlegislature in the election of senators, the people at large will\r\nacquire an additional privilege in returning members to the house of\r\nrepresentatives—whereas, by the present confederation, it is the\r\nlegislature alone that appoints the delegates to congress.\r\n\r\nThe power of direct taxation has likewise been treated as an improper\r\ndelegation to the fœderal government; but when we consider it as\r\nthe duty of that body to provide for the national safety, to support\r\nthe dignity of the union, and to discharge the debts contracted upon\r\nthe collective faith of the states, for their common benefit, it must\r\nbe acknowledged that those, upon whom such important obligations are\r\nimposed, ought, in justice and in policy, to possess every means\r\nrequisite for a faithful performance of their trust. But why should we\r\nbe alarmed with visionary evils? I will venture to predict, that the\r\ngreat revenue of the United States must, and always will, be raised by\r\nimpost; for, being at once less obnoxious, and more productive, the\r\ninterest of the government will be best promoted by the accommodation\r\nof the people. Still, however, the object of direct taxation should be\r\nwithin reach in all cases of emergency; and there is no more reason\r\nto apprehend oppression in the mode of collecting a revenue from this\r\nresource, than in the form of impost, which, by universal assent, is\r\nleft to the authority of the fœderal government. In either case, the\r\nforce of civil constitutions will be adequate to the purpose; and the\r\ndread of military violence, which has been assiduously disseminated,\r\nmust eventually prove the mere effusion of a wild imagination, or a\r\nfactious spirit. But the salutary consequences that must flow from thus\r\nenabling the government to relieve and support the credit of the union,\r\nwill afford another answer to the objections upon this ground. The\r\nstate of Pennsylvania, particularly, [32] which has encumbered itself\r\nwith the assumption of a great proportion of the public debt, will\r\nderive considerable relief and advantage; for, as it was the imbecility\r\nof the present confederation, which gave rise to the funding law, that\r\nlaw must naturally expire, when a complete and energetic fœderal\r\nsystem shall be substituted—the state will then be discharged from an\r\nextraordinary burden, and the national creditor will find it to be to\r\nhis interest to return to his original security.\r\n\r\nAfter all, my fellow-citizens, it is neither extraordinary nor\r\nunexpected, that the constitution offered to your consideration,\r\nshould meet with opposition. It is the nature of man to pursue his own\r\ninterest, in preference to the public good; and I do not mean to make\r\nany personal reflection, when I add, that it is the interest of a very\r\nnumerous, powerful, and respectable body, to counteract and destroy\r\nthe excellent work produced by the late convention. All the officers\r\nof government, and all the appointments for the administration of\r\njustice and the collection of the public revenue, which are transferred\r\nfrom the individual to the aggregate sovereignty of the states, will\r\nnecessarily turn the stream of influence and emolument into a new\r\nchannel. Every person, therefore, who either enjoys, or expects to\r\nenjoy a place of profit under the present establishment, will object to\r\nthe proposed innovation not, in truth, because it is injurious to the\r\nliberties of his country, but because it effects his schemes of wealth\r\nand consequence. I will confess, indeed, that I am not a blind admirer\r\nof this plan of government, and that there are some parts of it, which,\r\nif my wish had prevailed, would certainly have been altered. But, when\r\nI reflect how widely men differ in their opinions, and that every man\r\n(and the observation applies likewise to every state) has an equal\r\npretension to assert his own, I am satisfied that [33] any thing nearer\r\nto perfection could not have been accomplished. If there are errors,\r\nit should be remembered, that the seeds of reformation are sown in the\r\nwork itself, and the concurrence of two thirds of the congress may at\r\nany time introduce alterations and amendments. Regarding it, then, in\r\nevery point of view, with a candid and disinterested mind, I am bold\r\nto assert, that it is the BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS EVER BEEN\r\nOFFERED TO THE WORLD.(38)\r\n\r\n FINIS.\r\n\r\nThe / Letters / of / Fabius, / in 1788, / on the Federal Constitution;\r\n/.... / Copy-Right Secured. / From the office of the Delaware /\r\nGazette, Wilmington, / By W.

F.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDITOR TO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\nTHE First Nine Letters in this Collection, published in the beginning\r\nof the Year 1788, were occasioned by an alarming hesitation of some\r\nStates to ratify the Constitution proposed by the Federal Convention in\r\n1787.\r\n\r\nThey appeared separately in News-papers; and have never been published\r\ntogether, before the present Edition.\r\n\r\nSome Notes are added of Extracts from “_The Rights of Man_,” published\r\nabout three years after these Letters, containing similar sentiments,\r\nexpressed with a remarkable resemblance of Language, especially on\r\nthe two great subject—the _organization_ of a _constitution_ from\r\noriginal rights, and the _formation_ of _government_ from contributed\r\nrights, both of so much importance in laying regular _foundations_ of\r\nCivil Society, and consequently in securing the advancement of _human\r\nhappiness_.\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution proposed by the Federal Convention now engages the\r\nfixed attention of America.\r\n\r\nEvery person appears to be affected. Those who wish the adoption of\r\nthe plan, consider its rejection as the source of endless contests,\r\nconfusions, and misfortunes; and they also consider a resolution to\r\nalter, without previously adopting it, as a rejection.\r\n\r\nThose who oppose the plan, are influenced by different views. Some of\r\nthem are friends, others of them are enemies, to The United States.\r\n[2] The latter are of two classes; either men without principles or\r\nfortunes, who think they may have a chance to mend their circumstances,\r\nwith impunity, under a weak government, or in public convulsions, but\r\ncannot make them worse even by the last—or men who have been always\r\naverse to the revolution; and though at first confounded by that event,\r\nyet, their hopes reviving with the declension of our affairs, have\r\nsince persuaded themselves, that at length the people, tired out with\r\ntheir continued distresses, will return to their former connection with\r\nGreat Britain. To argue with these opposers, would be vain—The other\r\nopposers of the plan deserve the highest respect.\r\n\r\n_What concerns all, should be considered by all_; and individuals\r\nmay injure a whole society, by not declaring their sentiments. It\r\nis therefore not only their right, but their duty, to declare them.\r\nWeak advocates of a good cause or artful advocates of a bad one,\r\nmay endeavour to stop such communications, or to discredit them by\r\nclamour and calumny. This, however, is not the age for such tricks\r\nof controversy. Men have suffered so severely by being deceived upon\r\nsubjects of the highest import, those of religion and freedom, that\r\n_truth_ becomes infinitely valuable to them, not as a matter of curious\r\nspeculation, but of beneficial practice—A spirit of inquiry is\r\nexcited, information diffused, judgment strengthened.\r\n\r\nBefore this tribunal of _the people,_ let every one freely speak, what\r\nhe really thinks, [3] but with so sincere a reverence for the cause\r\nhe ventures to discuss, as to use the utmost caution, lest he should\r\nlead any into errors, upon a point of such sacred concern as the public\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt is not the design of this address, to describe the present\r\nderangement of our affairs, the mischiefs that must ensue from its\r\ncontinuance, the horrors, of a total dissolution of the union, or of\r\nthe division of it into partial confederacies. Nor is it intended to\r\ndescribe the evils that will result from pursuing the plan of another\r\nFederal Convention; as if a better temper of conciliation, or a more\r\nsatisfactory harmony of decisions, could be expected from men, after\r\ntheir minds are agitated with disgusts and disappointments, than before\r\nthey were thus disturbed; though from an uncontradicted assertion it\r\nappears, that without such provocations, the difficulty of reconciling\r\nthe interests of the several states was so near to _insuperable_, in\r\nthe late convention, that after many weeks spent in the most faithful\r\nlabours to promote concord, the members were upon the very point of\r\ndispersing in the utmost disorder, jealousy and resentment, and leaving\r\nthe states exposed to all the tempests of passions, that have been so\r\nfatal to confederacies of republics.\r\n\r\nAll these things, with observations on particular articles of the\r\nconstitution, have been laid before the public, and the writer of this\r\naddress means not to repeat what has been already said. What he wishes,\r\nis to simplify [4] the subject, so as to facilitate the inquiries of\r\nhis fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nMany are the objections made to the system proposed. They should be\r\ndistinguished. Some may be called local, because they spring from\r\nthe supposed interests of individual states. Thus, for instance,\r\nsome inhabitants of large states may desire the system to be so\r\naltered, that they may possess more authority in the decisions of the\r\ngovernment; or some inhabitants of commercial states may desire it to\r\nbe so altered, that the advantages of trade may center almost wholly\r\namong themselves; and this predilection they may think compatible\r\nwith the common welfare. Their judgment being thus warp’d, at the\r\nbeginning of their deliberations, objections are accumulated as very\r\nimportant, that, without this prepossession, would never have obtained\r\ntheir approbation. Certain it is, that strong understandings may be so\r\ninfluenced by this insulated patriotism, as to doubt—whether general\r\nbenefits can be communicated by a general government.(39)\r\n\r\nProbably nothing would operate so much for the correction of these\r\nerrors, as the perusal of the accounts transmitted to us by the\r\nancients, of the calamities occasioned in Greece by a conduct founded\r\non similar mistakes. They are expressly ascribed to this cause—that\r\neach city meditated a part on its own profit and ends——insomuch that\r\nthose _who seemed to contend for union_, could never relinquish their\r\nown interests [5] and advancement, while they deliberated for the public.\r\n\r\nHeaven grant! that our countrymen may pause in time—duly estimate the\r\npresent moment—and solemnly reflect—whether their measures may not\r\ntend to draw down the same distractions upon us, that desolated Greece.\r\n\r\nThey may now tolerably judge from the proceedings of the Federal\r\nConvention and of other conventions, what are the sentiments of America\r\nupon her present and future prospects. Let the voice of her distress be\r\nvenerated—and adhering to the generous Virginian declaration, let them\r\nresolve to “_cling to Union as the political Rock of our Salvation_.”\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia, }\r\n  _April 10, 1788_.}\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] LETTER II.\r\n\r\nBut besides the objections originating from the before mentioned cause,\r\nthat have been called local, there are other objections that are\r\nsupposed to arise from maxims of liberty and policy.—\r\n\r\nHence it is inferred, that the proposed system has such inherent vices,\r\nas must necessarily produce a bad administration, and at length the\r\noppression of a monarchy and aristocracy in the federal officers.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this address being convinced by as exact an investigation\r\nas he could make, that such mistakes may lead to the perdition of his\r\ncountry, esteems it his indispensable duty, strenuously to contend,\r\nthat—_the power of the people_ pervading the proposed system, together\r\nwith the _strong confederation of the states_, forms an adequate\r\nsecurity against every danger that has been apprehended.\r\n\r\nIf this single assertion can be supported by facts and arguments, there\r\nwill be reason to hope, that anxieties will be removed from the minds\r\nof some citizens, who are truly devoted to the interests of America,\r\nand who have been thrown into perplexities, by the mazes of multiplied\r\nand intricate disquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe objectors agree, that the confederation of the states will be\r\nstrong, according to the system proposed, and so strong, that many of\r\nthem loudly complain of that strength. On this part of the assertion,\r\nthere is no dispute: But some of the objections that have been\r\npublished, [7] strike at another part of the principle assumed, and\r\ndeny, that the system is sufficiently founded on the power of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe course of regular inquiry demands, that these objections should be\r\nconsidered in the first place. If they are removed, then all the rest\r\nof the objections, concerning unnecessary taxations, standing armies,\r\nthe abolishment of trial by jury, the liberty of the press, the freedom\r\nof commerce, the judicial, executive, and legislative authorities of\r\nthe several states, and the rights of citizens, and the other abuses\r\nof federal government, must, of consequence, be rejected, if the\r\nprinciple contains the salutary, purifying, and preserving qualities\r\nattributed to it. The question then will be—not what may be done, when\r\nthe government shall be turned into a tyranny; but how the government\r\ncan be so turned?\r\n\r\nThus unembarrassed by subordinate discussions, we may come fairly to\r\nthe contemplation of that superior point, and be better enabled to\r\ndiscover, whether our attention to it will afford any lights, whereby\r\nwe may be conducted to peace, liberty, and safety.\r\n\r\nThe objections, denying that the system proposed is sufficiently\r\nfounded on the power of the people, state, that the number of the\r\nfederal trustees or officers, is too small, and that they are to hold\r\ntheir offices too long.\r\n\r\nOne would really have supposed, that smallness of number could not be\r\ntermed a cause of danger, as influence must increase with enlargement.\r\nIf this is a fault, it will soon be corrected, [8] as an addition will\r\nbe often made to the number of the senators, and a much greater and\r\nmore frequently, to that of the representatives; and in all probability\r\nmuch sooner, than we shall be able and willing to bear the expence of\r\nthe addition.\r\n\r\nAs to the senate, it never can be, and it never ought to be large,\r\nif it is to possess the powers which almost all the objectors seem\r\ninclined to allot to it, as will be evident to every intelligent\r\nperson, who considers those powers.\r\n\r\nThough small, let it be remembered, that it is to be created by the\r\nsovereignties of the several states; that is, by the persons, whom\r\nthe people of each state shall judge to be most worthy, and who,\r\nsurely, will be religiously attentive to making a selection, in which\r\nthe interest and honour of their state will be so deeply concerned.\r\nIt should be remembered too, that this is the same manner, in which\r\nthe members of Congress are now appointed; and that herein, the\r\nsovereignties of the states are so intimately involved, that however\r\na renunciation of part of these powers may be desired by some of the\r\nstates, it _never_ will be obtained from the rest of them. Peaceable,\r\nfraternal, and benevolent as these are, they think, the concessions\r\nthey have made, ought to satisfy all.\r\n\r\nThat the senate may always be kept full, without the interference of\r\nCongress, it is provided in the system, that if vacancies happen by\r\nresignation or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of the\r\nstate, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments, until\r\nthe [9] next meeting of the legislature, which shall then fill up such\r\nvacancies.\r\n\r\nAs to the house of representatives, it is to consist of a number of\r\npersons, not exceeding one for every thirty thousand: But each state\r\nshall have at least one representative. The electors will reside,\r\nwidely dispersed, over an extensive country. Cabal and corruption will\r\nbe as impracticable, as, on such occasions, human institutions, can\r\nrender them. The will of freemen, thus circumstanced, will give the\r\nfiat. The purity of election thus obtained, will amply compensate for\r\nthe supposed defect of representation; and the members, thus chosen,\r\nwill be most apt to harmonize in their proceedings, with the general\r\ninterests, feelings, and sentiments of the people.\r\n\r\nAllowing such an increase of population as, from experience and a\r\nvariety of causes, may be expected, the representatives, in a short\r\nperiod, will amount to several hundreds, and most probably long before\r\nany change of manners for the worse, that might tempt or encourage our\r\nruler to mal-administration, will take place on this continent.\r\n\r\nThat this house may always be kept full, without the interference of\r\nCongress, it is provided in the system, that when vacancies happen\r\nin any state, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of\r\nelection to fill such vacancies.\r\n\r\nBut, it seems, the number of the federal officers is not only too\r\nsmall: They are to hold their offices too long.\r\n\r\n[10] This objection surely applies not to the house of representatives,\r\nwho are to be chosen every two years, especially if the extent of\r\nempire, and the vast variety and importance of their deliberations,\r\nbe considered. In that view, they and the senate will actually be not\r\nonly legislative but also diplomatic bodies, perpetually engaged in the\r\narduous talk of reconciling, in their determinations, the interests of\r\nseveral sovereign states, not to insist on the necessity of a competent\r\nknowledge of foreign affairs, relative to the states.\r\n\r\nThey who desire the representatives to be chosen every year, should\r\nexceed Newton in calculations, if they attempt to evince, that the\r\npublic business would, in that case, be better transacted, than when\r\nthey are chosen every two years. The idea, however, should be excused\r\nfor the zeal that prompted it.\r\n\r\nIs monarchy or aristocracy to be produced, without the consent of the\r\npeople, by a house of representatives, thus constituted?\r\n\r\nIt has been unanimously agreed by the friends of liberty, that\r\n_frequent elections of the representatives of the people, are the\r\nsovereign remedy of all grievances in a free government_.—Let us pass\r\non to the senate.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years after the first election, one third is to be\r\nelected for six years; and at the end of four years, another third.\r\nThus one third will constantly have but four years, and another but two\r\nyears to continue in office. The whole number at first will amount to\r\n[11] twenty-six, will be regularly renovated by the biennial election\r\nof one third, and will be overlooked, and overawed by the house of\r\nrepresentatives, nearly three times more numerous at the beginning,\r\nrapidly and vastly augmenting, and more enabled to overlook and\r\nover-awe them, by holding their offices for two years, as thereby they\r\nwill acquire better information, respecting national affairs. These\r\nrepresentatives will also command the public purse, as all bills for\r\nraising revenue, must originate in their house.\r\n\r\nAs in the Roman armies, when the Principes and Hastati had failed,\r\nthere were still the Triarii, who generally put things to rights, so we\r\nshall be supplied with another resource.\r\n\r\nWe are to have a president, to superintend, and if he thinks the public\r\nweal requires it, to controul any act of the representatives and senate.\r\n\r\nThis president is to be chosen, not by the people at large, because\r\nit may not be possible, that all the freemen of the empire should\r\nalways have the necessary information, for directing their choice of\r\nsuch an officer; nor by Congress, lest it should disturb the national\r\ncouncils; nor _by any one standing body whatever_, for fear of undue\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nHe is to be chosen in the following manner. Each state shall appoint,\r\nas the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to\r\nthe whole number of senators and representatives, to which the state\r\nshall be entitled in Congress: but no senator or representative, or\r\nperson holding an office of trust or profit under the United States,\r\nshall be appointed an elector. As these elec- [12] tors are to be\r\nappointed, as the legislature of each state may direct, the fairest,\r\nfreest opening is given, for each state to chuse such electors for this\r\npurpose, as shall be most signally qualified to fulfil the trust.\r\n\r\nTo guard against undue influence these electors, thus chosen, are to\r\nmeet in their respective states, and vote by ballot; and still further\r\nto guard against it, Congress may determine the time of chusing the\r\nelectors, and the days on which they shall give their votes—_which day\r\nshall be the same throughout the United States_. All the votes from the\r\nseveral states are to be transmitted to Congress, and therein counted.\r\nThe president is to hold his office for four years.\r\n\r\nWhen these electors meet in their respective states, utterly vain will\r\nbe the unreasonable suggestions derived for partiality. The electors\r\nmay throw away their votes, mark, with public disappointment, some\r\nperson improperly favored by them, or justly revering the duties of\r\ntheir office, dedicate their votes to the best interests of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis president will be no dictator. Two thirds of the representatives\r\nand the senate may pass any law, notwithstanding his dissent; and he is\r\nremovable and punishable for misbehaviour.\r\n\r\nCan this limited, fluctuating senate, placed amidst such powers, if it\r\nshould become willing, ever become able, to make America pass under its\r\nyoke? The senators will generally be inhabitants of places very distant\r\none from another. They can scarcely be acquainted till [13] they meet.\r\nFew of them can ever act together for any length of time, unless their\r\ngood conduct recommends them to a re-election; and then there will be\r\nfrequent changes in a body dependant upon the acts of other bodies,\r\nthe legislatures of the several states, that are altering every year.\r\nMachiavel and Cæsar Borgia together could not form a conspiracy in such\r\na senate, destructive to any but themselves and their accomplices.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to every good government, that there should be some\r\ncouncil, permanent enough to get a due knowledge of affairs internal\r\nand external; so constituted, that by some deaths or removals, the\r\ncurrent of information should not be impeded or disturbed; and so\r\nregulated, as to be responsible to, and controlable by the people.\r\nWhere can the authority for combining these advantages, be more\r\nsafely, beneficially, or satisfactorily lodged, than in the senate,\r\nto be formed according to the plan proposed? Shall parts of the trust\r\nbe committed to the president, with counsellors who shall subscribe\r\ntheir advices?(40) If assaults upon liberty are to be guarded against,\r\nand surely they ought to be with sleepless vigilance, why should we\r\ndepend more on the commander in chief of the army and navy of The\r\nUnited States, and of the militia of the several states, and on his\r\ncounsellors, whom he may secretly influence, than of the senate to be\r\nappointed by the persons exercising the sovereign authority of the\r\nseveral states? In truth, the [14] objections against the powers of the\r\nsenate originated from a desire to have them, or at least some of them,\r\nvested in a body, in which the several states should be represented,\r\nin proportion to the number of inhabitants, as in the house of\r\nrepresentatives. This method is _unattainable_, and the wish for it\r\nshould be dismissed from every mind, that desires the existence of a\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\nWhat assurance can be given, or what probability be assigned, that a\r\nboard of counsellors would continue honest, longer than the senate? Or,\r\nthat they would possess more useful information, respecting all the\r\nstates, than the senators of all the states? It appears needless to\r\npursue this argument any further.\r\n\r\nHow varied, balanced, concordant, and benign, is the system proposed\r\nto us? To secure the freedom, and promote the happiness of these and\r\nfuture states, by giving _the will of the people_ a decisive influence\r\nover the whole, and over all the parts, with what a comprehensive\r\narrangement does it embrace different modes of representation,\r\nfrom an election by a county to an election by an empire? What are\r\nthe complicated ballot, and all the refined devices of Venice for\r\nmaintaining her aristocracy, when compared with this plain-dealing work\r\nfor diffusing the blessings of equal liberty and common prosperity over\r\nmyriads of the human race?\r\n\r\nAll the foundations before mentioned, of the federal government, are by\r\nthe proposed system to be established, in the most clear, strong, [15]\r\npositive, unequivocal expressions, of which our language is capable.\r\nMagna carta, or any other law, never contained clauses more decisive\r\nand emphatic. While the people of these states have sense, they will\r\nunderstand them; and while they have spirit, they will make them to be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] LETTER III.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this address hopes, that he will now be thought so\r\ndisengaged from the objections against the principle assumed, that\r\nhe may be excused for recurring to his assertion, that—the power of\r\nthe people pervading the proposed system, together with the strong\r\nconfederation of the states, will form an adequate security against\r\nevery danger that has been apprehended.\r\n\r\nIt is a mournful, but maybe a useful truth, that the liberty of single\r\nrepublics has generally been destroyed by some of the citizens, and of\r\nconfederated republics, by some of the associated states.\r\n\r\nIt is more pleasing, and may be more profitable to reflect, that, their\r\ntranquility and prosperity have commonly been promoted, in proportion\r\nto the strength of their government for protecting the worthy against\r\nthe licentious.\r\n\r\nAs in forming a political society, each individual contributes some\r\nof his rights, in order that he may, from _a common stock_ of rights,\r\nderive greater benefits, than he could from merely _his own_; so,\r\nin forming a confederation, each political society should contribute\r\nsuch a share of their rights, as will, from _a common stock_ of these\r\nrights, produce the largest quantity of benefits for them.\r\n\r\nBut, what is that share? and, how to be managed? Momentous questions!\r\nHere, flattery is treason; and error, destruction.\r\n\r\n[17] Are they unanswerable? No. Our most gracious _Creator_ does not\r\ncondemn us to sigh for unattainable blessedness: But one thing he\r\ndemands—that we should seek for happiness in his way, and not in our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nHumility and benevolence must take place of pride and overweening\r\nselfishness. Reason, rising above these mists, will then discover\r\nto us, that we cannot be true to ourselves, without being true\r\nto others—that to love our neighbours as ourselves, is to love\r\nourselves in the best manner—that to give, is to gain—and, that we\r\nnever consult our own happiness more effectually, than when we most\r\nendeavour to correspond with _the divine designs_, by communicating\r\nhappiness, as much as we can, to our fellow-creatures. _Inestimable\r\ntruth!_ sufficient, if they do not barely ask what it is, to melt\r\ntyrants into men, and to soothe the inflamed minds of a multitude into\r\nmildness—_Inestimable truth!_ which our Maker in his providence,\r\nenables us, not only to talk and write about, but to adopt in practice\r\nof vast extent, and of instructive example.\r\n\r\nLet us now enquire, if there be not some _principle_, simple as the\r\nlaws of nature in other instances, from which, as from a _source_, the\r\nmany benefits of society are deduced.\r\n\r\nWe may with reverence say, that our _Creator_ designed men for society,\r\nbecause otherwise they cannot be happy. They cannot be happy without\r\nfreedom; nor free without security; that is, without the absence of\r\nfear; nor thus secure, without society. The conclusion [18] is strictly\r\nsyllogistic—that men cannot be free without society. Of course, they\r\ncannot be equally free without society, _which freedom produces the\r\ngreatest happiness_.\r\n\r\nAs these premises are invincible, we have advanced a considerable way\r\nin our enquiry upon _this deeply interesting subject_. If we can\r\ndetermine, what share of his rights, every individual must contribute\r\nto _the common stock_ of rights in forming a society, for obtaining\r\nequal freedom, we determine at the same time, what share of their\r\nrights each political society must contribute to _the common stock_ or\r\nrights in forming a confederation, which is only a larger society, for\r\nobtaining equal freedom: For, if the deposit be not proportioned to the\r\nmagnitude of the association in the latter case, it will generate the\r\nsame mischief among the component parts of it, from their inequality,\r\nthat would result from a defective contribution to association in the\r\nformer case, among the component parts of it, from their inequality.\r\n\r\nEach individual then must contribute such a share of his rights,\r\nas is necessary for attaining that _security_ that is essential to\r\nfreedom; and he is bound to make this contribution by the law of his\r\nnature, which prompts him to a participated happiness; that is, by the\r\ncommand of his creator; therefore, he must submit his will, _in what\r\nconcerns all_, to the will of all, that is of the whole society. What\r\ndoes he lose by this submission; The power of doing [19] injuries to\r\nothers—and the dread of suffering injuries from them. What does he\r\ngain by it? The aid of those associated with him, for his relief from\r\nthe incommodities of mental or bodily weakness—the pleasure for which\r\nhis heart is formed—of doing good—_protection_ against injuries—a\r\ncapacity of enjoying his undelegated rights to the best advantage—a\r\nrepeal of his fears—and tranquility of mind—or, in other words, that\r\nperfect liberty better described in the Holy Scriptures, than any where\r\nelse, in these expressions—“When every man shall sit under his vine,\r\nand under his fig-tree, and _none shall make him afraid_.”\r\n\r\nThe like submission, with a correspondent expansion and accommodation,\r\nmust be made between states, for obtaining the like benefits in a\r\nconfederation. _Men_ are the materials of both. As the largest number\r\nis but a junction of _units_—a confederation is but an assemblage of\r\nindividuals. The auspicious influence of the law of his nature, upon\r\nwhich the happiness of _man_ depends in society, must attend him in\r\nconfederation, or he becomes unhappy; for confederation should promote\r\nthe happiness of individuals, or it does not _answer the intended\r\npurpose_. Herein there is a progression, not a contradiction. As\r\n_man_, he becomes a citizen; as a citizen, he becomes a federalist.\r\nThe generation of one, is not the destruction of the other. He carries\r\ninto society his naked rights: These thereby improved, he carries still\r\nforward into confederation. If that sacred law before mentioned, is not\r\nhere [20] observed, the confederation would not be real, but pretended.\r\nHe would confide, and be deceived.(41)\r\n\r\n[21] The dilemma is inevitable. There must either be one will, or\r\nseveral wills. If but one will, all the people are concerned: if\r\nseveral wills, few comparatively are concerned. Surprizing! that this\r\ndoctrine should be contended for by those, who declare, that the\r\nconstitution is not founded on a bottom broad enough; and, though _the\r\nwhole people_ of the United States are to be _trebly_ represented in it\r\nin _three different modes_ of representation, and their servants will\r\nhave the most advantageous situations and opportunities of acquiring\r\nall requisite information for the welfare of the [22] whole union, yet\r\ninsist for a privilege of opposing, obstructing, and confounding all\r\ntheir measures taken with common consent for the general weal, by the\r\ndelays, negligences, rivalries, or other selfish views of parts of the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThus, while one state should be relied upon by the union for giving\r\naid, upon a recommendation of Congress, to another in distress, the\r\nlatter might be ruined; and the state relied upon, might suppose, it\r\nwould gain by such an event.\r\n\r\nWhen any persons speak of a consideration, do they, or do they not\r\nacknowledge, that the whole is interested in the safety of every\r\npart—in the agreement of parts—in the relation of parts [23] to one\r\nanother—to the whole—or, to other societies? If they do—then, the\r\nauthority of the whole, must be co-extensive with its interests—and if\r\nit is, the will of the whole must and ought in such cases to govern;\r\nor else the whole would have interests without an authority to manage\r\nthem—a position which prejudice itself cannot digest.\r\n\r\nIf they do not acknowledge, that the whole is thus interested, the\r\nconversation should cease. Such persons mean not a confederation, but\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nAs to the idea, that this superintending sovereign will must of\r\nconsequence destroy the subordinate sovereignties of the several\r\nstates, it is begging a concession of the question, by inferring, that\r\na manifest and great usefulness must necessarily end in abuse; and not\r\nonly so, but it requires an extinction of the principle of all society:\r\nfor the subordinate sovereignties, or, in other words, the undelegated\r\nrights of the several states, in a confederation, stand upon the\r\nvery same foundation with the undelegated rights of individuals in a\r\nsociety, the federal sovereign will being composed of the subordinate\r\nsovereign wills of the several confederated states. As some persons\r\nseem to think, a bill of rights is the best security of rights, the\r\nsovereignties of the several states have this best security by the\r\nproposed constitution, and more than this best security, for they are\r\nnot barely declared to be rights, but are taken into it as component\r\nparts for their perpetual preservation—by themselves. In short, the\r\ngovernment of each state is, and is to be, [24] sovereign and supreme\r\nin all matters that relate to each state only. It is to be subordinate\r\nbarely in those matters that relate to the whole; and it will be their\r\n_own faults_ if the several states suffer the federal sovereignty to\r\ninterfere in things of their respective jurisdictions. An instance of\r\nsuch interference with regard to any single state, will be a dangerous\r\nprecedent as to all, and therefore will be guarded against by all, as\r\nthe trustees or servants of the several states will not dare, if they\r\nretain their senses, so to violate the independent sovereignty of their\r\nrespective states, _that justly darling object_ of American affections,\r\nto which they are responsible, besides being endeared by all the\r\ncharities of life.\r\n\r\nThe common sense of mankind agrees to the devolutions of individual\r\nwills in society; and if it has not been as universally assented to in\r\nconfederation, the reasons are evident, and worthy of being retained\r\nin remembrance by Americans. They were want of opportunities, or the\r\nloss of them, through defects of knowledge and virtue. The principle,\r\nhowever, has been sufficiently vindicated in imperfect combinations, as\r\ntheir prosperity has generally been commensurate to its operation.\r\n\r\nHow beautifully and forcibly does the inspired Apostle Paul, argue upon\r\na sublimer subject, with a train of reasoning strictly applicable to\r\nthe present? His words are—“If the foot shall say, because I am not\r\nthe hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? and if\r\nthe ear shall say, because I am [25] not the eye, I am not of the body;\r\nis it therefore not of the body?” As plainly inferring, as could be\r\ndone in that allegorical manner, the strongest censure of such partial\r\ndiscontents and dissentions, especially, as his meaning is enforced by\r\nhis description of the benefits of union in these expressions—“But,\r\nnow they are many members, yet but one body: and the eye _cannot_ say\r\nto the hand, I have no need of thee.”\r\n\r\nWhen the commons of Rome upon a rupture with the Senate, seceded in\r\narms at the Mons sacer, Menemius Agrippa used the like allusion to\r\nthe human body, in his famous apologue of a quarrel among some of\r\nthe members. The unpolished but honest-hearted Romans of that day,\r\nunderstood him, and were appeased.\r\n\r\nAnother comparison has been made by the learned, between a natural\r\nand a political body; and no wonder indeed, when the title of the\r\nlatter was borrowed from the resemblance. It has therefore been justly\r\nobserved, that if a mortification takes place in one or some of the\r\nlimbs, and the rest of the body is sound, remedies may be applied,\r\nand not only the contagion prevented from spreading, but the diseased\r\npart or parts saved by the connection with the body, and restored to\r\nformer usefulness. When general putrefaction prevails, death is to be\r\nexpected. History sacred and profane tells us, that, _corruption of\r\nmanners sinks nations into slavery_.\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] LETTER IV.\r\n\r\nAnother question remains. How are the contributed rights to be managed?\r\nThe resolution has been in great measure anticipated, by what has been\r\nsaid concerning the system proposed. Some few reflections may perhaps\r\nfinish it.\r\n\r\nIf it be considered separately, a _constitution_ is the _organization_\r\nof the contributed rights in society. _Government_ is the _exercise_\r\nof them. It is intended for the benefit of the governed; of course can\r\nhave no just powers but what conduce to that end: and the awfulness of\r\nthe trust is demonstrated in this—that it is founded on the nature of\r\nman, that is, on the will of his _Maker_, and is therefore sacred. It\r\nis then an offence against Heaven, to violate that trust.(42)\r\n\r\n[27] If the organization of a constitution be defective, it may be\r\namended.\r\n\r\nA good constitution promotes, but not always produces a good\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe government must never be lodged in a single body. From such an one,\r\nwith an unlucky composition of its parts, rash, partial, illegal, and\r\nwhen intoxicated with success, even cruel, insolent and contemptible\r\nedits, may at times be expected. By these, if other mischiefs do not\r\nfollow, the national dignity may be impaired.\r\n\r\n[28] Several inconveniences might attend a division of the government\r\ninto two bodies, that probably would be avoided in another arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the most enlightened among mankind, confirmed by\r\nmultiplied experiments, points out the propriety of government being\r\ncommitted to such a number of great departments, as can be introduced\r\nwithout confusion, distinct in office, and yet connected in operation.\r\nIt seems to be agreed, that three or four of these departments are a\r\ncompetent number.\r\n\r\n[29] Such a repartition appears well calculated to express the sense\r\nof the people, and to encrease the safety and repose of the governed,\r\nwhich with the advancement of their happiness in other respects, are\r\nthe objects of government; as thereby there will be more obstructions\r\ninterposed; against errors, feuds, and frauds, in the administration,\r\nand the extraordinary interference of the people need be less frequent.\r\nThus, wars, tumults, and uneasinesses, are avoided. The departments so\r\nconstituted, may therefore be said to be balanced.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding, it must be granted, that a bad administration\r\nmay take place.—What is then to be done? The answer is instantly\r\nfound—Let the Fasces be lowered before—the supreme sovereignty of\r\nthe people. _It is their duty to watch, and their right to take care,\r\nthat the constitution be preserved_; or in the Roman phrase on perilous\r\noccasions—_to provide, that the republic receive no damage_.\r\n\r\nPolitical bodies are properly said to be balanced, with respect to\r\nthis _primary origination_ and _ultimate destination_, not to any\r\nintrinsic or constitutional properties.(43) It [30] is the _power_ from\r\nwhich they _proceed,_ and which they _serve_, that _truly and of right\r\nbalances_ them.(44)\r\n\r\nBut, as a good constitution not always produces a good administration,\r\na defective one not always excludes it. Thus in governments very\r\ndifferent from those of United America, general manners and customs,\r\nimprovement in knowledge, and the education and disposition of princes,\r\nnot unfrequently soften the features, [31] and qualify the defects.\r\nJewels of value are substituted, in the place of the rare and genuine\r\norient of highest price and brightest lustre: and though the sovereigns\r\ncannot even in their ministers, be brought to account by the governed,\r\nyet there are instances of their conduct indicating a veneration for\r\nthe rights of the people, and an internal conviction of the guilt that\r\nattends their violation. Some of them appear to be fathers of their\r\ncountries. Revered princes! Friends of mankind! May peace be in their\r\nlives—and in their deaths—Hope.\r\n\r\nBy this superior will of the people, is meant a reasonable, not a\r\ndistracted will. When frenzy seizes the mass, it would be equal madness\r\nto think of their happiness, that is, of their freedom. They will\r\ninfallibly have a Philip or a Cæsar, to bleed them into soberness of\r\nmind. At present we are cool; and let us attend to our business.\r\n\r\nOur government under the proposed confederation, will be guarded by a\r\nrepetition of the strongest cautions against excesses. In the senate\r\nthe sovereignties of the several states will be equally represented;\r\nin the house of representatives, the people of the whole union will be\r\nequally represented; and, in the president, and the federal independent\r\njudges, so much concerned in the execution of the laws, and in the\r\ndetermination of their constitutionality, the sovereignties of the\r\nseveral states and the people of the whole union, may be considered as\r\nconjointly represented.\r\n\r\n[32] Where was there ever and where is there now upon the face of the\r\nearth, a government so diversified and attempered? If a work formed\r\nwith so much deliberation, so respectful and affectionate an attention\r\nto the interests, feelings, and sentiments of all United America, will\r\nnot satisfy, what would satisfy all United America?\r\n\r\nIt seems highly probable, that those who would reject this labour of\r\npublic love, would also have rejected the Heaven-taught institution of\r\n_trial by jury,_ had they been consulted upon its establishment. Would\r\nthey not have cried out, that there never was framed so detestable,\r\nso paltry, and so tyrannical a device for extinguishing freedom, and\r\nthrowing unbounded domination into the hands of the king and barons,\r\nunder a contemptible pretence of preserving it? “What! Can freedom\r\nbe preserved by imprisoning its guardians? Can freedom be preserved,\r\nby keeping twelve men closely confined without meat, drink, fire,\r\nor candle, until they unanimously agree, and this to be innumerably\r\nrepeated? Can freedom be preserved, by thus delivering up a number of\r\nfreemen to a monarch and an aristocracy, fortified by dependant and\r\nobedient judges and officers, to be shut up, until under duress they\r\nspeak as they are ordered? Why cannot the twelve jurors separate,(45)\r\nafter hearing the evidence, return to their respective homes, and\r\nthere take time,(45) and think of the matter at their ease?(45) Is\r\nthere not a variety of [33] ways, in which causes have been, and can\r\nbe tried, without this _tremendous, unprecedented inquisition_? Why\r\nthen is it insisted on; but because the fabricators of it know that it\r\nwill, and intend that it shall reduce the people to slavery? Away with\r\nit—Freemen will never be enthralled by so insolent, so execrable, so\r\npitiful a contrivance.”\r\n\r\nHappily for us our ancestors thought otherwise. They were not so\r\nover-nice and curious, as to refuse blessings, because, they might\r\npossibly be abused.\r\n\r\nThey perceived, that the uses included were great and manifest.\r\nPerhaps they did not foresee, that from this acorn, as it were, of\r\ntheir planting, would be produced a perpetual vegetation of political\r\nenergies, that “would secure the just liberties of the nation for a\r\nlong succession of ages,(46) and elevate it to the distinguished rank\r\nit has for several centuries held. As to abuses, they trusted to their\r\nown spirit for preventing or correcting them: And worthy is it of deep\r\nconsideration by every friend of freedom, that abuses that seem to be\r\nbut trifles,”(47) may be attended by fatal consequences. What can be\r\n“trifling,” that diminishes or detracts from the only defence, that\r\never was found against “open attacks and secret machinations?”(48)\r\nThis establishment originates from a knowledge of human nature.\r\nWith a superior force, wisdom, and benevolence united,[34] it\r\nrives the difficulties concerning administration of justice, that\r\nhave distressed, or destroyed the rest of mankind. It reconciles\r\ncontradictions—vastness of power, with safety of private station. It\r\nis ever new, and always the same.\r\n\r\nTrial by jury and the dependence of taxation upon representation,\r\nthose corner stones of liberty, were not obtained by a bill of rights,\r\nor any other records, and have not been and cannot be preserved by\r\nthem. They and all other rights must be preserved, by _soundness of\r\nsense and honesty of heart_. Compared with these, what are a bill of\r\nrights, or any characters drawn upon paper or parchment, those frail\r\nremembrances? Do we want to be reminded, that the sun enlightens,\r\nwarms, invigorates, and cheers? or how horrid it would be, to have his\r\nblessed beams intercepted, by our being thrust into mines or dungeons?\r\nLiberty is the sun of society. Rights are the beams.(49)\r\n\r\n[35] “It is the duty which every man owes to his country, his friends,\r\nhis posterity, and himself, to maintain to the utmost of his power this\r\nvaluable palladium in all its rights; to restore to its ancient\r\ndignity, if at all impaired by the different value of property, or\r\notherwise deviated from its first institution; to amend it, wherever\r\nit is defective;(50) and above all to guard with the most jealous\r\ncircumspection against the new and arbitrary methods of trial, which,\r\nunder a variety of plausible pretences, may in time imperceptibly\r\nundermine this best preservative of liberty.”(51) Trial by Jury is our\r\nbirthright; and tempted to his own ruin, by some seducing spirit, must\r\nbe the man, who in opposition to the genius of United America, shall\r\ndare to attempt its subversion.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed confederation, it is preserved inviolable in criminal\r\ncases, and cannot be altered in other respects, but when United America\r\ndemands it.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a disposition in men to find fault, no difficult\r\nmatter, rather than to act as they ought. The works of creation itself\r\nhave been objected to: and one learned prince declared, that if he had\r\nbeen consulted, they would have been improved. With what book has so\r\nmuch fault been found, as with the Bible? Perhaps, principally, because\r\nit so clearly and strongly enjoins men _to do right_. How many, how\r\nplausible objections have been [36] made against it, with how much\r\nardor, with how much pains? Yet, the book has done more good than all\r\nthe books in the world; would do much more, if duly regarded; and might\r\nlead the objectors against it to happiness, if they would value it as\r\nthey should.\r\n\r\nWhen objections are made to a system of high import, should they not\r\nbe weighed against the benefits? Are these great, positive, immediate?\r\nIs there a chance of endangering them by rejection or delay? _May\r\nthey not be attained without admitting the objections at present_,\r\nsupposing the objections to be well founded? If the objections are well\r\nfounded, may they not be hereafter admitted, without danger, disgust,\r\nor inconvenience? Is the system so formed, that they may be thus\r\nadmitted? May they not be of less efficiency, than they are thought\r\nto be by their authors? are they not designed to hinder evils, which\r\nare generally deemed to be sufficiently provided against? May not the\r\nadmission of them prevent benefits, that might otherwise be obtained?\r\nIn political affairs, is it not more safe and advantageous, for all\r\nto agree in measures that may not be best, than to quarrel among\r\nthemselves, what are best?\r\n\r\nWhen questions of this kind with regard to the plan proposed,\r\nare calmly considered, it seems reasonable to hope, that every\r\nfaithful citizen of United America, will make up his mind, with much\r\nsatisfaction to himself, and advantage to his country.\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\n[37] It has been considered, what are the rights to be contributed,\r\nand how they are to be managed; and it has been said, that republican\r\ntranquility and prosperity have commonly been promoted, in proportion\r\nto the strength of government for protecting the worthy against the\r\nlicentious.\r\n\r\nThe protection herein mentioned, refers to cases between citizens and\r\ncitizens, or states and states: But there is also a protection to be\r\nafforded to all the citizens, or states, against foreigners. It has\r\nbeen asserted, that this protection never can be afforded, but under\r\nan appropriation, collection, and application, of the general force,\r\nby the will of the whole combination. This protection is in a degree\r\ndependent on the former, as it may be weakened by internal discords\r\nand especially where the worst party prevails. Hence it is evident,\r\nthat such establishments as tend most to protect the worthy against\r\nthe licentious, tends most to protect all against foreigners. This\r\nposition is found to be verified by indisputable facts, from which it\r\nappears, that when nations have been, as it were, condemned for their\r\ncrimes, unless they first became suicides, foreigners have acted as\r\nexecutioners.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. As government is intended for the happiness of\r\nthe people, the protection of the worthy against those of contrary\r\ncharacters, is calculated to promote the end of legitimate government,\r\nthat is the general welfare; [38] for _the government will partake of\r\nthe qualities of those whose authority is prevalent_. If it be asked,\r\nwho are the worthy, we may be informed by a heathen poet—\r\n\r\n                     “Vir bonus est quis?\r\n  “Qui consulta patrum, qui leges juraque servat.”(52)\r\n\r\nThe best foundations of this protection, that can be laid by man, are\r\na constitution and government secured, as well as can be, from the\r\nundue influence of passions either in the people or their servants.\r\nThen in a contest between citizens and citizens, or states and states,\r\nthe standard of laws may be displayed, explained and strengthened by\r\nthe well-remembered sentiments and examples of our fore-fathers,\r\nwhich will give it a sanctity far superior to that of their eagles so\r\nvenerated by the former masters of the world. This circumstance will\r\ncarry powerful aids to the true friends of their country, and unless\r\ncounteracted by the follies of Pharsalia, or the accidents of Philippi,\r\nmay secure the blessings of freedom to succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nIt has been contended that the plan proposed to us, adequately secures\r\nus against the influence of passions in the federal servants. Whether\r\nit as adequately secures us against the influence of passions in the\r\npeople, or in particular states, time will determine, and _may the\r\ndetermination be propituous_.\r\n\r\n[39] Let us now consider the tragical play of the passions in similar\r\ncases; or, in other words, the consequences of their irregularities.\r\nDuly governed, they produce happiness.\r\n\r\nHere the reader, is respectfully requested, to assist the intentions\r\nof the writer, by keeping in mind, the ideas of a single republic with\r\none democratic branch in its government, and of a confederation of\r\nrepublics with one or several democratic branches in the government of\r\nthe confederation, or in the government of its parts, so that as he\r\nproceeds, a comparison may easily run along, between any of these and\r\nthe proposed plan.\r\n\r\nHistory is entertaining and instructive; but if admired chiefly for\r\namusement, it may yield little profit. If read for improvement, it is\r\napprehended, a slight attention only will be paid to the vast variety\r\nof particular incidents, unless they be such as may meliorate the\r\nheart. A knowledge of the distinguishing features of nations, the\r\nprinciples of their governments, the advantages and disadvantages\r\nof their situations, the methods employed to avail themselves of\r\nthe first, and to alleviate the last, their manners, customs, and\r\ninstitutions, the sources of events, their progresses, and determining\r\ncauses, may be eminently useful, tho’ obscurity may rest upon a\r\nmultitude of attending circumstances. Thus one nation may become\r\nprudent and happy, not only by the wisdom and success, but even by the\r\nerrors and misfortunes of another.\r\n\r\n[40] In Carthage and Rome, there was a very numerous senate,\r\nstrengthened by prodigious attachments, and in a great degree\r\nindependent of the people. In Athens, there was a senate strongly\r\nsupported by the powerful court of Areopagus. In each of these\r\nrepublics, their affairs at length became convulsed, and their liberty\r\nwas subverted. What cause produced these effects? Encroachments of the\r\nsenate upon the authority of the people? No! but directly the reverse,\r\naccording so the unanimous voice of historians; that is, encroachments\r\nof the people upon the authority of the senate. The people of these\r\nrepublics absolutely _laboured_ for their own destruction; and never\r\nthought themselves so free, as when they were promoting their own\r\nsubjugation. Though even after these encroachments had been made, and\r\nruin was spreading around, yet the remnants of senatorial authority\r\ndelayed the final catastrophe.(53)\r\n\r\n[41] In more modern times, the Florentines exhibited a memorable\r\nexample. They were divided into violent parties; and the prevailing one\r\nvested exorbitant powers in the house of Medici, then possessed, as it\r\nwas judged, of more money than any crowned head in Europe. Though that\r\nhouse engaged and persevered in the attempt, yet the people were never\r\ndespoiled of their liberty, until they were overwhelmed by the armies\r\nof foreign princes, to whose enterprizes their situation exposed them.\r\n\r\nRepublics of later date and various form have appeared. Their\r\ninstitutions consist of old errors tissued with hasty inventions,\r\nsomewhat excusable, as the wills of the Romans, made with arms in their\r\nhands. Some of them were condensed(54), by dangers. They are still\r\ncompressed by them into a sort of union. Their well-known transactions\r\nwitness, that their connection is not enough compact and arranged.\r\nThey have all suffered, or are suffering through that defect. Their\r\nexistence seems to depend more upon others, than upon themselves. There\r\nmight be an impropriety in saying more, considering the peculiarity of\r\ntheir circumstances at this time.\r\n\r\n[42] The wretched mistake of the great men who were leaders in the long\r\nparliament of England, in attempting, by not filling up vacancies, to\r\nextend their power over a brave and sensible people, accustomed to\r\n_popular representation_, and their downfall, when their victories and\r\npuissance by sea and land had thrown all Europe into astonishment and\r\nawe, shew, how difficult it is for rulers to usurp over a people who\r\nare not wanting to themselves.\r\n\r\nLet the fortunes of confederated republics be now considered.\r\n\r\n“The Amphictionic council,” or “general court of Greece,” claims the\r\nfirst regard. Its authority was very great: But, the parts were not\r\nsufficiently combined, to guard against the ambitious, avaricious, and\r\nselfish projects of some of them; or, if they had the power, they dared\r\nnot to employ it, as the turbulent states were very sturdy, and made a\r\nsort of partial confederacies.(55)\r\n\r\n[43] “The Achæan league” seems to be the next in dignity. It was at\r\nfirst, small, consisting of few states: afterwards, very\r\nextensive, constituting of many. In their diet or Congress, they\r\nenacted laws, disposed of vacant employments, declared war, made peace,\r\nentered into alliances, compelled every state of the union to [44]\r\nobey its ordinances, and managed other affairs. Not only their laws,\r\nbut their magistrates, council, judges, money, weights and measures,\r\nwere the same. So uniform were they, that all seemed to be but one\r\nstate. Their chief officer called Strategos, was chosen in the Congress\r\nby a majority of votes. He presided in [45] the Congress, commanded\r\nthe forces, and was vested with great powers, especially in time of\r\nwar: but was liable to be called to an account by the Congress, and\r\npunished, if convicted of misbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThe states have been oppressed by the kings of Macedon, and insulted\r\nby tyrants. “From their incorporation,” says Polybius, “may be dated\r\nthe birth of that greatness, that by a constant augmentation, at length\r\narrived to a marvellous height of prosperity. The same of their wise\r\nlaws and mild government reached the Greek colonies in Italy, where the\r\nGrotoniates, the Sybarites, and the Cauloniates, agreed to adopt them,\r\nand to govern their states conformably.”\r\n\r\nDid the delegates to the Amphictionic council, or to the Congress of\r\nthe Achæan league destroy the liberty of their country, by establishing\r\na monarchy or an aristocracy among themselves? Quite the contrary.\r\n_While the several states continued faithful to the union, they\r\nprospered_. Their affairs were shattered by dissensions, emulations,\r\nand civil wars, artfully and diligently fomented by princes who thought\r\nit their interest; and in the case of the Achæan league, partly, by\r\nthe folly and wickedness of Greeks not of the league, particularly the\r\nÆtolians, who repined at the glories, that constantly attended the\r\nbanner of freedom, supported by virtue and conducted by prudence. Thus\r\nweakened, they all sunk together, the envied and the envying, under the\r\ndomination, first of Macedon, and then of Rome.\r\n\r\n[46] Let any man of common sense peruse the gloomy but instructive\r\npages of their mournful story, and he will be convinced, that if any\r\nnation could successfuly have resisted those conquerors of the world,\r\nthe illustrious deed had been achieved by Greece; that cradle of\r\nrepublics, if the several states had been cemented by some such league\r\nas the Achæan, and had honestly fulfilled its obligations.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended, that the Achæan league was perfect, or that they\r\nwere not monarchical and aristocratical factions among the people of\r\nit. Every concession of that sort, that can be asked, shall be made. It\r\nhad many defects; every one of which, however, has been avoided in the\r\nplan proposed to us.\r\n\r\nWith all its defects, with all its disorders, yet such was the life and\r\nvigor communicated through the whole, by the popular representation of\r\neach part, and the close combination of all, that\r\nthe true spirit of republicanism _predominated_, and thereby advanced\r\nthe happiness and glory of the people to so pre-eminent a state that\r\n_our_ ideas upon the pleasing theme cannot be too elevated. Here is\r\nthe proof of this assertion. When the Romans had laid Carthage in\r\nashes; had reduced the kingdom of Macedon to a province; had conquered\r\nAntiochus the great, and got the better of all their enemies in the\r\nEast; these Romans, masters of so much of the then known world,\r\ndetermined to humble the Achæan league, because as history expressly\r\ninforms us, “their great power began to raise no small jealousy at\r\nRome.”—Polybius.\r\n\r\n[47] What a vast weight of argument do these facts and circumstances\r\nadd to the maintenance of the principle contended for by the writer of\r\nthis address?\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[48] LETTER VI.\r\n\r\nSome of our fellow-citizens have ventured to predict the future state\r\nof United America, if the system proposed to us, shall be adopted.\r\n\r\nThough every branch of the constitution and government is to be\r\npopular, and guarded by the strongest provisions, that until this day\r\nhave occurred to mankind, yet the system will end, they say, in the\r\noppressions of a monarchy or aristocracy by the federal servants or\r\nsome of them.\r\n\r\nSuch a conclusion seems not in any manner suited to the premises. It\r\nstartles, yet, not so much from its novelty, as from the respectability\r\nof the characters by which it is drawn.\r\n\r\nWe must not be too much influenced by our esteem for those characters:\r\nBut, should recollect, that when the fancy is warmed, and the judgment\r\ninclined, by the proximity or pressure of particular objects, very\r\nextraordinary declarations are not unfrequently made. Such are the\r\nfrailties of our nature, that genius and integrity sometimes afford no\r\nprotection against them.\r\n\r\nProbably, there never was, and never will be, such an instance of\r\ndreadful denunciation, concerning the fate of a country, as was\r\npublished while the union was in agitation between England and\r\nScotland. The English were for a joint legislature, many of the Scots\r\nfor separate legislatures, and urged, that they should be in [49] a\r\nmanner swallowed up and lost in the other, as then they would not\r\npossess one eleventh part in it.\r\n\r\nUpon that occasion lord Belhaven, one of the most distinguished orators\r\nof the age, made in the Scottish parliament a famous speech, of which\r\nthe following extract is part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “My lord Chancellor,\r\n\r\n“When I consider this affair of an union between the two nations, as it\r\nis expressed in the several articles thereof, and now the subject of\r\nour deliberation at this time, I find my mind crowded with a variety\r\nof very melancholy thoughts, and I think it my duty to disburthen\r\nmyself of some of them, by laying them before and exposing them to the\r\nserious consideration of this honourable house.\r\n\r\n“I think, _I see a free and independent kingdom_ delivering up that,\r\nwhich all the world hath been fighting for since the days of Nimrod;\r\nyea, that, for which most of all the empires, kingdoms, states,\r\nprincipalities, and dukedoms of Europe, are at this very time engaged\r\nin the most bloody and cruel wars that ever were; to wit, _a power to\r\nmanage their own affairs by themselves, without the assistance and\r\ncouncil of any other_.\r\n\r\n“I think I see _a National Church_, founded upon a rock, secured by a\r\nclaim of right, hedged and fenced about by the strictest and pointedest\r\nlegal sanctions that sovereignty could contrive, voluntarily descending\r\ninto a plain upon an equal level with Jews, Paptists, Socinians [50],\r\nArmenians, and Anabaptists, and other Sectaries, &c.\r\n\r\n“I think I see _the noble and honorable peerage of Scotland_, whose\r\nvaliant predecessors led against their enemies upon their own proper\r\ncharges and expences, now divested of their followers and vassalages,\r\nand put upon such an equal foot with their vassals, that I think, I see\r\na petty English _exciseman_ receive more homage and respect, than what\r\nwas paid formerly to their quondam Mackallamors.\r\n\r\n“I think, I see _the present peers of Scotland_, whose noble ancestors,\r\nconquered provinces, overrun countries, reduced and subjected towns\r\nand fortified places, exacted tribute through the greatest part of\r\nEngland, now walking in the _court of requests_, like so many English\r\nAttornies, laying aside their walking swords when in company with the\r\nEnglish Peers, lest their self-defence should be found murder.\r\n\r\n“I think, I see _the honorable Estate of Barons_, the bold assertors of\r\nthe nations rights and liberties in the worst of times, now setting _a\r\nwatch upon their lips_ and _a guard upon their tongues_, lest they be\r\nfound guilty of _scandalum magnatum_.\r\n\r\n“I think I see _the royal State of Boroughs_, walking their _desolate\r\nstreets_, hanging down their heads _under disappointments_; worm’d\r\nout of _all the branches of their old trade_, uncertain _what hand to\r\nturn to_, necessitated to become [51] apprentices to their unkind\r\nneighbors, and yet after all finding their _trade so fortified by\r\ncompanies_ and secured by prescriptions, that they despair of any\r\nsuccess therein.\r\n\r\n“I think, I see _our learned Judges_ laying aside their practiques\r\nand decisions, studying the common law of England, gravelled with\r\ncertioraries, _nisi priuses_, writs of error, _ejectiones firmæ_,\r\ninjunctions, demurrers, &c. and frighted with _appeals_ and\r\n_avocations_, because of _the new regulations_, and _rectifications_\r\nthey meet with.\r\n\r\n“I think, I see _the valiant and gallant soldiery_, either sent to\r\nlearn the plantation trade abroad, or at home petitioning for _a small\r\nsubsistence_, as the reward of their honourable exploits, while their\r\nold corps are broken, the common soldiers left to beg, and the youngest\r\nEnglish corps kept standing.\r\n\r\n“I think, I see the _honest industrious tradesman_ loaded with _new\r\ntaxes and impositions_, disappointed of the equivalents, drinking\r\nwater in place of ale, eating his saltless pottage, petitioning for\r\n_encouragement to his manufactories_, and answered by counter petitions.\r\n\r\n“In short, I think I see the _laborious ploughman_, with his corn\r\nspoiling upon his hands _for want of sale_, cursing the day of his\r\nbirth; dreading the expence of his burial, and uncertain whether to\r\nmarry or do worse.\r\n\r\n“I think I see the incurable difficulties of _landing men_, fettered\r\nunder the golden chain of equivalents, their pretty daughters\r\npetitioning [52] for want of husbands, and their sons for want of\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\n“I think I see _our mariners delivering up their ships_ to their Dutch\r\npartners, and what through _presses and necessity_ earning their bread\r\nas underlings in the English navy. But above all, my lord, I think, I\r\nsee _our ancient mother Caledonia_, like Cæsar, sitting in the midst\r\nof our senate, ruefully looking round about her, covering herself with\r\nher royal garment, attending the fatal blows and breathing out her last\r\nwith a——_Et tu quoque mi fili_.\r\n\r\n“Are not these, my lord, very afflicting thoughts? And yet they are the\r\nleast part suggested to me by these dishonorable articles. Should not\r\nthe considerations of these things vivify these dry bones of ours?\r\nShould not the memory of our noble predecessors’ valor and constancy\r\nrouse up our drooping spirits? Are our noble predecessors’ souls got so\r\nfar into the English cabbage-stalks and cauliflowers, that we should\r\nshew the least inclination that way? Are our eyes so blinded? Are\r\nour ears so deafened? Are our hearts so hardened? Are our tongues so\r\nfaultered? Are our hands so fettered? that in this our day, I say, my\r\nlord, that in this our day, we should not mind the things that concern\r\nthe very being and well being of our ancient kingdom, before the day be\r\nhid from our eyes.\r\n\r\n“When I consider this treaty as it hath been explained, and spoke to,\r\nbefore us these three weeks by past; I see the English constitution\r\nremaining firm, the same _two houses_ of Parliament [53], the same\r\n_taxes_, the same _customs_, the same _excises_, the same _trading\r\ncompanies_, the same municipal laws and courts of judicature; _and all\r\nours either subject to regulations or annihilations_, only we are to\r\nhave _the honor_ to pay _their old debts_, and to have some few persons\r\npresent for witnesses, to the validity of the deed, when they are\r\npleased to contract more.”(56)\r\n\r\nLet any candid American deliberately compare that transaction with\r\nthe present, and laying his hand upon his heart, solemnly answer\r\nthis question to himself—Whether, he does not verily believe the\r\neloquent Peer before mentioned, had ten-fold more cause to apprehend\r\nevils from such an unequal match between the two kingdoms, that any\r\ncitizen of these states has to apprehend them from the system proposed?\r\nIndeed not only that Peer, but other persons of distinction and\r\nlarge numbers of the people of Scotland were filled with the utmost\r\naversion to the union; and if the greatest diligence and prudence had\r\nnot been employed by its friends in removing misapprehensions and\r\nrefuting misrepresentations, and by the then subsisting government\r\nfor preserving the public peace, there would certainly have been a\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nYet, _what were the consequences_ to Scotland of that _dreaded_ union\r\nwith England? The cultivation of her virtues and the correction of her\r\nerrors—The emancipation of one [54] class of her citizens from the\r\nyoke of her superiors—A relief of other classes from the injuries\r\nand insults of the great—Improvements in agriculture, science, arts,\r\ntrade, and manufactures—The profits of industry and ingenuity enjoyed\r\nunder the protection of laws—peace and security at home, and encrease\r\nof respectability abroad. Her Church is still eminent—Her laws and\r\ncourts of judicature are safe—Her boroughs grown into cities—Her\r\nmariners and soldiery possessing a larger subsistence than she could\r\nhave afforded them, and her tradesmen, ploughmen, landed men, and her\r\npeople of every rank, in a more flourishing condition, not only than\r\nthey ever were, but in a more flourishing condition, than the clearest\r\nunderstanding could, at the time, have thought it possible for them to\r\nattain in so short a period, or even in many ages. England participated\r\nin the blessings. The stock of their union or ingraftment, as perhaps\r\nit may be called, being strong and capable of drawing better nutriment\r\nand in greater abundance, than they could ever have done apart,\r\n\r\n  “Ere long, to Heaven the soaring branches shoot,\r\n  “And wonder at their height, and more than native fruit.”\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[55] LETTER VII.\r\n\r\nThus happily mistaken was the ingenious, learned, and patriotic lord\r\nBelhaven, in his prediction concerning the fate of his country; and\r\nthus happily mistaken, it is hoped, some of our fellow-citizens will\r\nbe, in their prediction concerning the fate of their country.\r\n\r\nHad they taken large scope, and assumed in their proposition the\r\nvicissitude of human affairs, and the passions that so often confound\r\nthem, their prediction might have been a tolerably good guess. Amidst\r\nthe mutabilities of terrestrial things, the liberty of United America\r\nmay be destroyed. As to that point, it is our duty, humbly, constantly,\r\nfervently, to implore the protection of our most gracious maker,\r\n“who doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men,” and\r\nincessantly to strive, as we are commanded, to recommend ourselves to\r\nthat protection, by “doing his will,” diligently exercising our reason\r\nin fulfilling the purposes for which that and our existence were given\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nHow the liberty of this country is to be destroyed, is another\r\nquestion. Here, the gentlemen assign a cause, in no manner\r\nproportioned, as it is apprehended, to the effect.\r\n\r\nThe uniform tenor of history is against them. That holds up the\r\n_licentiousness_ of the people, and _turbulent temper_ of some of the\r\nstates, as _the only causes_ to be dreaded, not the conspiracies of\r\nfederal officers. Therefore [56], it is highly probable, that, if our\r\nliberty is ever subverted, it will be by one of the two causes first\r\nmentioned. Our tragedy will then have the same acts, with those of the\r\nnations that have gone before us; and we shall add one more example to\r\nthe number already too great, of people that would not take warning,\r\nnot, “know the things which belong to their peace.” But, we ought not\r\nto pass such a sentence against our country, and the interests of\r\nfreedom: Though, no sentence whatever can be equal to the atrocity of\r\nour guilt, if through enormity of obstinacy or baseness, we betray the\r\ncause of our posterity and of mankind, by providence committed to our\r\nparental and fraternal care. There is reason to believe, that the\r\ncalamities of nations are the punishments of their sins.\r\n\r\nAs to the first mentioned cause, it seems unnecessary to say any more\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAs to the second, we find, that the misbehaviour of the constituent\r\nparts acting separately, or in partial confederacies, debilitated the\r\nGreeks under The Amphictionic Council, and under The Achæan League. As\r\nto the former, it was not entirely an assembly of strictly democratical\r\nrepublics. Besides, it wanted a sufficiently close connection of its\r\nparts. After these observations, we may call our attention from it.\r\n\r\n’Tis true, The Achæan League was disturbed by the misconduct of some\r\nparts, but it is as true, that it surmounted these difficulties, and\r\nwonderfully prospered, until it was dissolved in the manner that has\r\nbeen described.\r\n\r\n[57] The glorious operations of its principles bear the clearest\r\ntestimony to this distant age and people, that the wit of man never\r\ninvented such an antidote against monarchical and aristocratical\r\nprojects, as a strong combination of truly democratical republics. By\r\nstrictly or truly democratical republics, the writer means republics in\r\nwhich all the principal officers, except the judicial, are from time to\r\ntime chosen by the people.\r\n\r\nThe reason is plain. As liberty and equality, or as well termed by\r\nPolybius, _benignity_, were the foundations of their institutions, and\r\nthe energy of the government pervaded all the parts in things relating\r\nto the whole, it counteracted for the common welfare, the designs\r\nhatched by selfishness in separate councils.\r\n\r\nIf folly or wickedness prevailed in any parts, friendly offices\r\nand salutary measures restored tranquility. Thus the public good\r\nwas maintained. In its very formation, tyrannies and aristocracies\r\nsubmitted, by consent or compulsion. Thus, the Ceraunians, Trezenians,\r\nEpidaurians, Megalopolitans, Argives, Hermionians, and Phlyayzrians\r\nwere received into the league. A happy exchange! For history informs\r\nus, that so true were they to their noble and benevolent principles,\r\nthat, in their diet, “_no resolutions were taken, but what were\r\nequally advantageous to the whole confederacy, and the interest of\r\neach part so consulted, as to leave no room for complaints!_”\r\n\r\n[58] How degrading would be the thought to a citizen of United America,\r\nthat the people of these states, with institutions beyond comparison\r\npreferable to those of The Achæan league, and so vast a superiority in\r\nother respects, should not have wisdom and virtue enough, to manage\r\ntheir affairs, with as much prudence and affection of one for another\r\nas these ancients did.\r\n\r\nWould this be doing justice to our country? The composition of her\r\ntemper is excellent, and seems to be acknowledged equal to that of any\r\nnation in the world. Her prudence will guard its warmth against two\r\nfaults, to which it may be exposed—The one, an imitation of _foreign\r\nfashions_, which from small things may lead to great. May her citizens\r\naspire at a national dignity in every part of conduct, private as well\r\nas public. This will be influenced by the former. May _simplicity_\r\nbe the characteristic feature of their manners, which, inlaid with\r\ntheir other virtues and their forms of government, may then indeed\r\nbe compared, in the Eastern stile, to “apples of gold in pictures\r\nof silver.” Thus will they long, and may they, while their rivers\r\nrun, escape the contagion of luxury—that motley issue of innocence\r\ndebauched by folly, and the lineal predecessor of tyranny, prolific\r\nof guilt and wretchedness. The other fault, of which, as yet, there\r\nare no symptoms among us, is the _thirst of empire_. This is a vice,\r\nthat ever has been, and from the nature of things, ever must be, fatal\r\nto republican [59] forms of government. Our wants, are sources of\r\nhappiness: our irregular desires, of misery. The abuse of prosperity,\r\nis rebellion against Heaven; and succeeds accordingly.\r\n\r\nDo the propositions of gentlemen who object, offer to our view, any of\r\n_the great points_ upon which, the fate, fame, or freedom of nations\r\nhas turned, excepting what some of them have said about trial by jury;\r\nand which has been frequently and fully answered? Is there one of them\r\ncalculated to regulate, and if needful, to _controul_ those tempers and\r\nmeasures of constituent parts of an union, that have been so baneful to\r\nthe weal of every confederacy that has existed? Do not some of them\r\ntend to enervate the authority evidently designed thus to regulate and\r\ncontroul? Do not others of them discover a bias in their advocates to\r\nparticular connections, that if indulged to them, would enable persons\r\nof less understanding and virtue, to repeat the disorders, that have\r\nso often violated public peace and honor? Taking them altogether,\r\nwould they afford as strong a security to our liberty, as the frequent\r\nelection of the federal officers by the people, and the repartition of\r\npower among those officers, according to the proposed system?\r\n\r\nIt may be answered, that, they would be an additional security. In\r\nreply, let the writer be permitted at present to refer to what has been\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe principal argument of gentlemen who object, involves a direct\r\nproof of the point contended for by the writer of this address, and as\r\n[60] far as it may be supposed to be founded, a plain confirmation of\r\nHistoric evidence.\r\n\r\nThey generally agree, that the great danger of a monarchy or\r\naristocracy among us, will arise from the federal senate.\r\n\r\nThe members of this senate, are to be chosen by men exercising the\r\nsovereignty of their respective states. These men therefore must be\r\nmonarchically or aristocratically disposed, before they will chuse\r\nfederal senators thus disposed; and what merits particular attention,\r\nis, that these men must have obtained an overbearing influence in their\r\nrespective states, before they could with such disposition arrive at\r\nthe exercise of the sovereignty in them: or else, the like disposition\r\nmust be prevalent among the people of such states.\r\n\r\nTaking the case either way, is not this a disorder in parts of the\r\nunion, and ought it not to be rectified by the rest? Is it reasonable\r\nto expect, that the disease will seize all at the same time? If it is\r\nnot, ought not the sound to possess a right and power, by which they\r\nmay prevent the infection from spreading? And will not _the extent_ of\r\nour territory, and the _number_ of states within it, vastly increase\r\nthe difficulty of any political disorder diffusing its contagion, and\r\nthe probability of its being repressed?\r\n\r\nFrom the annals of mankind, these conclusions are deducible—that\r\nconfederated states may act prudently and honestly, and apart foolishly\r\nand knavishly; but, that it is a defiance [61] of all probability, to\r\nsuppose, that states conjointly shall act with folly and wickedness,\r\nand yet separately with wisdom and virtue.\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[62] LETTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe proposed confederation offers to us a system of diversified\r\nrepresentation in the legislative, executive, and judicial departments,\r\nas essentially necessary to the good government of an extensive\r\nrepublican empire. Every argument to recommend it, receives new force,\r\nby contemplating events, that must take place. The number of states in\r\nAmerica will increase. If not united to the present, the consequences\r\nare evident. If united, it must be by a plan that will communicate\r\nequal liberty and assure just protection to them. These ends can never\r\nbe attained, but by a close combination of the several states.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted, that a very extensive territory cannot be ruled\r\nby a government of republican form. What is meant by this proposition?\r\nIs it intended to abolish all ideas of connection, and to precipitate\r\nus into the miseries of division, either as single states, or partial\r\nconfederacies? To stupify us into despondence, that destruction\r\nmay certainly seize us? The fancy of poets never feigned so dire a\r\nMetamorphosis, as is now held up to us. The Ægis of their Minerva was\r\nonly said to turn men into stones. This spell is to turn “a band of\r\nbrethren,” into a monster, preying on itself, and preyed upon by all\r\nits enemies.\r\n\r\nIf hope is not to be abandoned, common sense teaches us to attempt\r\nthe best means of preservation. This is all that men can do, and [63]\r\nthis they ought to do. Will it be said, that any kind of disunion,\r\nor a connection tending to it, is preferable to a firm union? Or, is\r\nthere any charm in that despotism, which is said, to be alone competent\r\nto the rule of such an empire? There is no evidence of fact, nor any\r\ndeduction of reason, that justifies the assertion. It is true, that\r\nextensive territory has in general been arbitrarily governed; and it\r\nis as true, that a number of republics, in such territory, loosely\r\nconnected, must inevitably rot into despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is said—Such territory has never been governed by a confederacy\r\nof republics. Granted. But, where was there ever a confederacy of\r\nrepublics, in such territory, united, as these states are to be by\r\nthe proposed constitution? Where was there ever a confederacy, in\r\nwhich, the sovereignty of each state was equally represented in one\r\nlegislative body, the people of each state equally represented in\r\nanother, and the sovereignties and people of all the states conjointly\r\nrepresented, possessed such a qualified and temperating authority\r\nin making laws? Or, in which the appointment to federal offices was\r\nvested in a chief magistrate chosen as our president is to be? Or,\r\nin which, the acts of the executive department were regulated, as\r\nthey are to be with us? Or, in which, the federal judges were to hold\r\ntheir offices independently and during good behaviour? Or, in which,\r\nthe authority over the militia and troops was so distributed and\r\ncontrouled, as it is to be with us? Or, in which, the people were so\r\ndrawn together by religion, blood, language, manners and [64] customs,\r\nundisturbed by former feuds or prejudices? Or, in which, the affairs\r\nrelating to the whole union, were to be managed by an assembly of\r\nseveral representative bodies, invested with different powers that\r\nbecame efficient only in concert, without their being embarrassed by\r\nattention to other business? Or, in which, a provision was made for\r\nthe federal revenue, without recurring to coercion against states, the\r\nmiserable expedient, of every other confederacy that has existed, an\r\nexpedient always attended with odium, and often with a delay productive\r\nof irreparable damage? Where was there ever a confederacy, that thus\r\nadhered to the first principle in civil society; obliging by its direct\r\nauthority every individual, to contribute, when the public good\r\nnecessarily required it, a just proportion of aid to the support of the\r\ncommonwealth protecting him—without disturbing him in the discharge\r\nof the duties owing by him to the state of which he is an inhabitant;\r\nand at the same time, so amply, so anxiously provided, for bringing the\r\ninterests, and even the wishes of every sovereignty and of every person\r\nof the union, under all their various modifications and impressions,\r\ninto their full operation and efficacy in the national councils? The\r\ninstance never existed. The conclusion ought not to be made. It is\r\nwithout premises. So far is the assertion from being true, that “a very\r\nextensive territory cannot be ruled by a government of a republican\r\nform,” that such a territory cannot be well-ruled by a government of\r\nany other form.\r\n\r\n[65] The assertion has probably been suggested by reflections on the\r\ndemocracies of antiquity, without making a proper distinction between\r\nthem and the democracy of The United States.\r\n\r\nIn the democracies of antiquity, the people assembled together and\r\ngoverned personally. This mode was incompatible with greatness of\r\nnumber and dispersion of habitation.\r\n\r\nIn the democracy of The United States, the people act by their\r\nrepresentatives. This improvement collects the will of millions upon\r\npoints concerning their welfare, with more advantage, than the will of\r\nhundreds could be collected under the ancient form.\r\n\r\nThere is another improvement equally deserving regard, and that is, the\r\nvaried representation of sovereignties and people in the constitution\r\nnow proposed.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that this representation was a mere compromise.\r\n\r\nIt was not a mere compromise. _The equal representation of each\r\nstate in one branch of the legislature_, was an original substantive\r\nproposition, made in convention, very soon after the draft offered by\r\nVirginia, to which last mentioned state United America is much indebted\r\nnot only in other respects, but for her merit in the origination and\r\nprosecution of this momentous business.\r\n\r\nThe proposition was expressly made upon this principle, that a\r\nterritory of such extent as that of United America, could not be\r\nsafely and advantageously governed, but by a combination of republics,\r\neach retaining all the rights of supreme [66] sovereignty, excepting\r\nsuch as ought to be contributed to the union; that for the securer\r\npreservation of these sovereignties, they ought to be represented in\r\na body by themselves, and with equal suffrage; and that they would be\r\nannihilated, if both branches of the legislature were to be formed\r\nof representatives of the people, in proportion to the number of\r\ninhabitants in each state.(57)\r\n\r\nThe principle appears to be well founded in reason. Why cannot a very\r\nextensive territory be ruled by a government of republican form? They\r\nanswered, because its power must languish through distance of parts.\r\nGranted, if it be not a “body by joints and bands having nourishment\r\nministered and knit together.” If it be such a body, the objection is\r\nremoved. Instead of such a perfect body, framed upon the principle that\r\ncommands men to associate, and societies to confederate; that, which by\r\ncommunicating and extending happiness, corresponds with the gracious\r\nintentions of our maker towards us his creatures? what is proposed?\r\nTruly, that the natural legs and arms of this body should be cut off,\r\nbecause they are too weak, and their places supplied by strongest limbs\r\nof wood and metal.\r\n\r\n[67] Monarchs, it is said, are enabled to rule extensive territories,\r\nbecause they send viceroys to govern certain districts; and thus the\r\nreigning authority is transmitted over the whole empire. Be it so: But\r\nwhat are the consequences? Tyranny, while the viceroys continue in\r\nsubmission to their masters, and the distraction of civil war besides,\r\nwhen they revolt, to which they are frequently tempted by the very\r\ncircumstances of their situation, as the history of such governments\r\nindisputably proves.\r\n\r\nAmerica is, and will be, divided into several sovereign states, each\r\npossessing every power proper for governing within its own limits for\r\nits own purposes, and also for acting as a member of the union.\r\n\r\nThey will be civil and military stations, conveniently planted\r\nthroughout the empire, with lively and regular communications. A\r\nstroke, a touch upon any part, will be immediately felt by the whole.\r\nRome famed for imperial arts, had a glimpse of this great truth; and\r\nendeavoured, as well as her hard-hearted policy would permit, to\r\nrealize it in her _colonies_. They were miniatures of the capital: But\r\nwanted the vital principal of sovereignty, and were too small. They\r\nwere melted down into, or overwhelmed by the nations around them. Were\r\nthey now existing, they might be called curious automatons—something\r\nlike to our living originals. These, will bear a remarkable resemblance\r\nto the mild features of patriarchal government, in which each son ruled\r\nhis own household, and in other matters the whole family was directed\r\nby the common ancestor.\r\n\r\n[68] Will a people thus happily situated, ever desire to exchange their\r\ncondition, for subjection to an absolute ruler; or can they ever look\r\nbut with veneration, or act but with deference to that union, that\r\nalone can, under providence, preserve them from such subjugation?\r\n\r\nCan any government be devised, that will be more suited to citizens,\r\nwho wish for equal freedom and common prosperity; better calculated\r\nfor preventing corruption of manners; for advancing the improvements\r\nthat endear or adorn life; or that can be more conformed to the\r\nunderstanding, to the best affections, to the very nature of _man_?\r\nWhat harvests of happiness may grow from the seeds of liberty that are\r\nnow sowing? The cultivation will indeed demand continual attention,\r\nunceasing diligence, and frequent conflict with difficulties: but, to\r\nobject against the benefits offered to us by our Creator, by excepting\r\nto the terms annexed, is a crime to be equalled only by its folly.\r\n\r\nDelightful are the prospects that will open to the view of United\r\nAmerica—her sons well prepared to defend their own happiness, and\r\nready to relieve the misery of others—her fleets formidable, but only\r\nto the unjust—her revenue sufficient, yet unoppressive—her commerce\r\naffluent, but not debasing—peace and plenty within her borders—and\r\nthe glory that arises from a proper use of power, encircling them.\r\n\r\nWhatever regions may be destined for servitude, let us hope, that some\r\nportions of this land may be blessed with liberty; let us be con- [69]\r\nvinced, that _nothing short of such an union_ as has been proposed, can\r\npreserve the blessing; and therefore let us be resolved to adopt it.\r\n\r\nAs to alterations, a little _experience_ will cast more light upon the\r\nsubject, than a multitude of debates. Whatever qualities are possessed\r\nby those who object, they will have the candor to confess, that they\r\nwill be encountered by opponents, not in any respect inferior, and yet\r\ndiffering from them in judgment, upon every point they have mentioned.\r\n\r\nSuch untired industry to serve their country, did the delegates to\r\nthe federal convention exert, that they not only laboured to form the\r\nbest plan they could, but, _provided for making at any time amendments\r\non the authority of the people_, without shaking the stability of\r\nthe government. For this end, the Congress, whenever two-thirds of\r\nboth houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to\r\nthe constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of\r\ntwo-thirds of the several states, _shall_ call a convention for\r\nproposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all\r\nintents and purposes, as part of the constitution, when ratified by the\r\nlegislatures of three-fourths of the several states, or by conventions\r\nin three-fourths thereof, as one or the other mode of ratification may\r\nbe proposed by Congress.\r\n\r\nThus, by a gradual progress, we may from time to time _introduce every\r\nimprovement in our constitution_, that shall be [70] suitable to our\r\nsituation. For this purpose, it may perhaps be advisable, for every\r\nstate, as it sees occasion, to form with the utmost deliberation,\r\ndrafts of alterations respectively required by them, and to enjoin\r\ntheir representatives, to employ every proper method to obtain a\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nIn this way of proceeding, the undoubted sense of every state,\r\ncollected in the coolest manner, not the sense of individuals, will be\r\nlaid before the whole union in congress, and that body will be enabled\r\nwith the clearest light that can be afforded by every part of it,\r\nand with the least occasion of irritation, to compare and weigh the\r\nsentiments of all United America; forthwith to adopt such alterations\r\nas are recommended by general unanimity; by degrees to devise modes of\r\nconciliation upon contradictory propositions; and to give the revered\r\nadvice of our common country, upon those, if any such there should be,\r\nthat in her judgment are inadmissible, because they are incompatible\r\nwith the happiness of these states.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be with reason apprehended, that Congress will refuse to act\r\nupon any articles calculated to promote the _common_ welfare, though\r\nthey may be unwilling to act upon such as are designed to advance\r\n_partial_ interests: but, whatever their sentiments may be, they\r\n_must_ call a convention for proposing amendements, on applications of\r\ntwo-thirds of the legislatures of the several states.\r\n\r\nMay those good citizens, who have sometimes turned their thoughts\r\ntowards a second [71] convention, be pleased to consider, that there\r\nare men who speak as they do, yet do not mean as they do. These borrow\r\nthe sanction of their respected names, to conceal desperate designs.\r\nMay they also consider, whether persisting in the suggested plan, in\r\npreference to the constitutional provision, may not kindle flames of\r\njealousy and discord, which all their abilities and virtues can never\r\nextinguish.\r\n\r\n  FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[72] LETTER IX.\r\n\r\nWhen the sentiments of some objectors, concerning the British\r\nconstitution, are considered, it is surprising, that they should\r\napprehend so much danger to United America, as, they say, will attend\r\nthe ratification of the plan proposed to us, by the late federal\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen will acknowledge, that Britain has sustained many\r\ninternal convulsions, and many foreign wars, with a gradual advancement\r\nin freedom, power, and prosperity. They will acknowledge, that no\r\nnation has existed that ever so perfectly united those distant\r\nextremes, private security of life, liberty, and property, with\r\nexertion of public force—so advantageously combined the various\r\npowers of militia, troops, and fleets—or so happily blended together\r\narms, arts, science, commerce, and agriculture. From what spring has\r\nflowed this stream of happiness? The gentlemen will acknowledge, that\r\nthese advantages are derived from a single democratical branch in her\r\nlegislature. They will also acknowledge, that in this branch, called\r\nthe house of commons, only one hundred and thirty-one are members for\r\ncounties: that nearly one half of the whole house is chosen by about\r\nfive thousand seven hundred persons, mostly of no property; that\r\nfifty-six members are elected by about three hundred and seventy [73]\r\npersons, and the rest in an enormous disproportion(58) to the numbers\r\nof inhabitants who ought to vote.(59)\r\n\r\nThus are all the millions of people in that kingdom, said to be\r\nrepresented in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nLet the gentlemen be so good, on a subject so familiar to them, as to\r\nmake a comparison between the British constitution, and that proposed\r\nto us. Questions like these will then probably present themselves:\r\nIs there more danger to our liberty, from such a president as we are\r\nto have, than to that of Britons from an hereditary monarch with a\r\nvast revenue—absolute in the erection and disposal of offices, and\r\nin the exercise of the whole executive power—in the command of the\r\nmilitia, fleets, and armies, and the direction of their operations—in\r\nthe establishments of fairs and markets, the regulation of weights\r\nand measures, and coining of money—who can call parliaments with a\r\nbreath, and dissolve them with a nod—who can, at his will, make war,\r\npeace, and treaties irrevocably binding the nation—and who can [74]\r\ngrant pardons and titles of nobility, as it pleases him? Is there more\r\ndanger to us, from twenty-six senators, or double the number, than\r\nto Britons, from an hereditary aristocratic body, consisting of many\r\nhundreds, possessed of enormous wealth in lands and money—strengthened\r\nby a host of dependants—and who, availing themselves of defects in the\r\nconstitution, send many of these into the house of commons—who hold a\r\nthird part of the legislative power in their own hands—and who form\r\nthe highest court of judicature in the nation? Is there more danger to\r\nus, from a house of representatives, to be chosen by all the freemen\r\nof the union, every two years, than to Britons, from such a sort of\r\nrepresentation as they have in the house of commons, the members of\r\nwhich, too, are chosen but every seven years? Is there more danger to\r\nus, from the intended federal officers, than to Britons, from such a\r\nmonarch, aristocracy, and house of commons together? _What bodies_\r\nare there in Britain, vested with such capacities for enquiring into,\r\nchecking, and regulating the conduct of national affairs, _as our\r\nsovereign states_? What proportion does the number of _free holders_\r\nin Britain bear to the number of people? And what is the proportion in\r\nUnited America?\r\n\r\nIf any person, after considering such questions, shall say, there will\r\nbe more danger to our freedom under the proposed plan, than to that of\r\nBritons under their constitution, he must mean, that Americans are,\r\nor will be, beyond all comparison, inferior to Britons in under- [75]\r\nstanding and virtue; otherwise, with a constitution and government,\r\nevery branch of which is so extremely popular, they certainly might\r\nguard their rights, at least at well, as Britons can guard theirs,\r\nunder such political institutions as they have; unless the person has\r\nsome inclination to an opinion, that monarchy and aristocracy are\r\nfavourable to the preservation of their rights. If he has, he cannot\r\ntoo soon recover himself. If ever monarchy or aristocracy appears in\r\nthis country, in must be in the hideous form of despotism.\r\n\r\nWhat an infatuated, depraved people must Americans become, if, with\r\nsuch unequalled advantages, committed to their trust in a manner\r\nalmost miraculous, they lose their liberty? Through a single organ of\r\nrepresentation, in the legislature only, of the kingdom just mentioned,\r\nthough that organ is diseased, such portions of popular sense and\r\nintegrity have been conveyed into the national councils, as have\r\npurified other parts, and preserved the whole in its present state of\r\nhealthfulness. To their own vigour and attention, therefore, is that\r\npeople, under providence, indebted for the blessings they enjoy. They\r\nhave held, and now hold _the true balance_ in their government. While\r\nthey retain their enlightened spirit, they will continue to hold it;\r\nand _if they regard what they owe to others_, as well as what they owe\r\nto themselves, they will, most probably, continue to be happy.(60)\r\n\r\n[76] They know, that there are powers that cannot be expressly limited,\r\nwithout injury to themselves; and their magnanimity scorns any fear of\r\nsuch powers. This magnanimity taught Charles the first, that he was but\r\na royal servant; and this magnanimity caused James the second’s army,\r\nraised, paid, and kept up by himself, to confound him with huzzas for\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThey ask not for compacts, of which the national welfare, and, in\r\nsome cases, its existence, may demand violations. They despise such\r\ndangerous provisions against danger.\r\n\r\nThey know, that all powers whatever, even those that, according to the\r\nforms of the constitution [77], are irresistible and absolute, of which\r\nthere are many, ought to be exercised for the public good; and that\r\nwhen they are used to the public detriment, they are unconstitutionally\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\nThis plain text, commented upon by their experienced intelligence, has\r\nled them safe through hazards of every kind: and they now are, what we\r\nsee them. Upon the review, one is almost tempted to believe, that their\r\ninsular situation, soil, climate, and some other circumstances, have\r\ncompounded a peculiarity of temperature, uncommonly favourable to the\r\nunion of reason and passion.\r\n\r\nCertainly, ’tis very memorable, with what life, impartiality, and\r\nprudence, they have interposed on great occasions; have by their\r\npatriotism communicated temporary soundness to their disordered\r\nrepresentation; and have bid public confusions to cease. Two instances\r\nout of many may suffice. The excellent William the third was distressed\r\nby a house of commons. He dissolved the parliament, and appealed to the\r\npeople. They relieved him. His successor, the present king, in the like\r\ndistress, made the same appeal; and received equal relief.\r\n\r\nThus they have acted: but Americans, who have the same blood in their\r\nveins, have, it seems, very different heads and hearts. We shall be\r\nenslaved by a president, senators, and representatives, chosen by\r\nourselves, and continually rotating within the period of time assigned\r\nfor the continuance in office of members in the house of commons?\r\n’Tis strange: but, we are told, ’tis true. It may be so. As we [78]\r\nhave our all at stake, let us enquire, in what way this event is to\r\nbe brought about. Is it to be before or after a general corruption of\r\nmanners? If after, it is not worth attention. The loss of happiness\r\nthen follows of course. If before, how is it to be accomplished? Will\r\na virtuous and sensible people choose villains or fools for their\r\nofficers? Or, if they should choose men of wisdom and integrity, will\r\nthese lose both or either, by taking their seats? If they should,\r\nwill not their places be quickly supplied by another choice? Is the\r\nlike derangement again, and again, and again, to be expected? Can any\r\nman believe, that such astonishing phaænomena are to be looked for?\r\nWas there ever an instance, where rulers, thus selected by the people\r\nfrom their own body, have, in the manner apprehended, outraged their\r\nown tender connexions, and the interests, feelings, and sentiments\r\nof their affectionate and confiding countrymen? Is such a conduct\r\nmore likely to prevail in this age of mankind, than in the darker\r\nperiods that have preceded? Are men more disposed now than formerly,\r\nto prefer uncertainties to certainties, things perilous and infamous\r\nto those that are safe and honorable? Can all the mysteries of such\r\niniquity, be so wonderfully managed by treacherous rulers, that none\r\nof their enlightened constituents, nor any of their honest associates,\r\nacting with them in public bodies, shall ever be able to discover the\r\nconspiracy, till at last it shall burst with destruction to the whole\r\nfederal constitution? Is it not ten thousand times less probable,\r\nthat such [79] transactions will happen, than it is, that we shall be\r\nexposed to innumerable calamities, by rejecting the plan proposed, or\r\neven by delaying to accept it?\r\n\r\nLet us consider our affairs in another light. Our difference of\r\ngovernment, participation in commerce, improvement in policy, and\r\nmagnitude of power, can be no favourite objects of attention to\r\nthe Monarchies and Sovereignties of Europe. Our loss will be their\r\ngain—our fall, their rise—our shame, their triumph. Divided, they may\r\ndistract, dictate, and destroy. United, their efforts will be waves\r\ndashing themselves into foam against a rock. May our national character\r\nbe—an animated moderation, that seeks only its own, and will not be\r\nsatisfied with less.\r\n\r\nTo his beloved fellow-citizens of United America, the writer dedicates\r\nthis imperfect testimony of his affection, with fervent prayers, for a\r\nperpetuity of freedom, virtue, piety, and felicity, to them and their\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n FABIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks / on the / Proposed Plan / of a / Federal Government, /\r\nAddressed to the Citizens of the / United States of America, / And\r\nParticularly to the People of Maryland, / By Aristides. / “As a\r\nconfederated government is composed of petty re-/ “publics, it enjoys\r\nthe internal happiness of each; and with / “regard to its external\r\nsituation, by means of the associa-/ “tion, it possesses all the\r\nadvantages of extensive monarchies.” / Mont.

L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\nNot as a Tribute to the Worth, which no Acknowledgement, or\r\nDistinctions, can reward; but to do himself an Honour, which, by\r\nlabouring in the same Common Cause, he flatters himself, in some\r\nDegree, he hath deserved; the Author begs Leave to inscribe the\r\nfollowing imperfect Essay.\r\n\r\nIt is my intention, with all possible plainness, to examine the\r\nproposed plan of a Federal Government. Its enemies and its advocates\r\nhave laid particular stress on the names, wherewith it is subscribed.\r\nAs one side would obtain your implicit assent, by a reference to\r\ncharacters, and as the other would defeat measures by exciting your\r\njealousy of men, permit me, in the first place, to make some general\r\nobservations on the persons who composed the late memorable convention.\r\n\r\nIn general, they had been distinguished by their talents and services.\r\nThey were not principally the men to whom the idea of the convention\r\nfirst suggested itself, and it is notorious that, in general, they\r\naccepted their appointments with reluctance. It would seem, however,\r\naccording to some vague insinuations, that, no sooner did they find\r\nthemselves convened, than their natures changed; and fatally have they\r\ncombined for the destruction of your liberties. Now this altogether\r\nshocks my faith. I should sooner imagine that the sacredness of the\r\ntrust, the unparalleled grandeur of the occasion, and the fellowship of\r\nthe great and good, might have elevated the soul of the most abandoned\r\nwretch, had it been possible for such to obtain a seat in that\r\nillustrious assemblage.\r\n\r\nIf those, who would inspire suspicion and distrust, can suggest any\r\nprecise idea, it must be this, that the members of the convention will\r\nbe elected into the first federal congress, and there combining again\r\nwill compose a body capable of bearing down all opposition to their own\r\naggrandisement.\r\n\r\nBy their scheme, however, thus deeply concerted, the house of\r\nrepresentatives is to be chosen by the people once in [6] two years;\r\nand if they have acted so as to warrant any reasonable apprehension of\r\ntheir designs, it will be easy at any time, to prevent their election.\r\nThe truth is, that very few of them either wish to be elected, or\r\nwould consent to serve, either in that house, or in the senate. I have\r\nexercised my imagination to devise in what manner they or any other\r\nmen, supposing them to bear full sway in both houses, could erect\r\nthis imaginary fabric of power. I request any person to point out any\r\nlaw, or system of laws, that could be possibly contrived for that\r\npurpose, obtain the final assent of each branch, and be carried into\r\neffect, contrary to the interests and wishes of a free, intelligent,\r\nprying people, accustomed to the most unbounded freedom of inquiry. To\r\nbegin by an attempt to restrain the press, instead of promoting their\r\ndesigns, would be the most effectual thing to prevent them.\r\n\r\nI am apprized of the _almost_ universal disposition for the increase\r\nand abuse of authority. But if we are to withhold power because there\r\nis a possibility of its perversion, we must abolish government, and\r\nsubmit to those evils, which it was intended to prevent. The perfection\r\nof political science consists chiefly in _providing mutual checks\r\namongst the several departments of power, preserving at the same time,\r\nthe dependance of the greatest on the people_. I speak with reference\r\nto a single government. The necessity of another species of government,\r\nfor the mutual defence and protection of these American states, no man\r\nof sense and honesty, that I know of, has ever yet denied.\r\n\r\nThe convention had the above principle constantly in their view. They\r\nhave contrived, that it shall be extremely difficult, if not altogether\r\nimpracticable, for any person to exceed or abuse his lawful authority.\r\nThere is nothing in their plan like the cloathing of individuals\r\nwith power, for their own gratification. Every delegation, and every\r\nadvantage that may be derived to individuals, has a strict reference to\r\nthe general good.\r\n\r\nTo examine their constitution, by article and section, would be a\r\npainful and needless undertaking. I shall endeavor to answer such\r\nobjections, as I have already heard, to anticipate others; to point out\r\nsome advantages not generally [7] known; and to correct certain errors,\r\nwith respect to construction. When the convention was appointed, I much\r\nfeared that the numerous seeds, and principles of discord amongst the\r\nstates, would, for ever, prevent them from agreeing to any efficient\r\nsystem whatever. I apprehended, in particular, that the dispute about\r\nrepresentation would be the rock, on which the vessel containing all\r\nour hopes would be dashed. When, therefore, I discerned that equitable\r\ncompromise between the larger and lesser states, my anxiety was\r\ninstantly removed, and my soul enlightened by a sudden ray.\r\n\r\nHow then was I, some months after, disgusted at the repetition, of the\r\narguments respecting the inequality of representatives in the first\r\nbranch. We were told, that the minority in convention reasoned on\r\nfirst principles, that, as all men, in a state of nature, are equal\r\nwith respect to rights, so also are equal all separate and distinct\r\nstates;—that, when individuals form a free government, they must\r\nall have equal suffrage, either in framing laws by themselves, or in\r\nchoosing representatives, although one man be ten times stronger,\r\nricher, or wiser than another; so also, when several states unite,\r\nfor common convenience, they must meet on terms of perfect equality,\r\nalthough one be ten times more wealthy, expensive and populous than\r\nanother;—that, under our present compact, the states are equal, and\r\nthat no injury has resulted from the equality.\r\n\r\nTo these arguments, we may imagine, was opposed something like the\r\nfollowing: “You talk of first principles, and, at the same time, would\r\nlet 180,000 free inhabitants of Maryland have no more to do in the\r\nchoice of representatives than only 30,000 inhabitants of Delaware. Do\r\nyou propose, that these 30,000 shall bear an equal part of burthens and\r\nimpositions? As to no injury having resulted from the equality, as you\r\ncall it, under the articles of confederation, we think the reverse; and\r\nthat this pretended(61) equality was a poison, which pervaded all our\r\naffairs.” [8]\r\n\r\nThe anticipation of arguments like these had raised those apprehensions\r\nof an irreconcilable difference. It were needless to repeat more. Had\r\nan angel been the umpire, he could propose no expedient more equitable\r\nand more politic, not only as a compromise, but to establish such a\r\ndecided difference between the two branches of congress, as will make\r\nthem, indeed, two distinct bodies, operating by way of mutual balance\r\nand check.\r\n\r\nBy this expedient, is safety secured to the lesser states, as\r\ncompletely as if the senate were the only legislative body. It is\r\npossible (_if such a thing can be devised_) that, from the inequality\r\nin the first branch, propositions will be made to give the larger\r\nstates some advantage over the lesser; but the equality in the senate\r\nwill, for ever, preclude its adoption. It is well worthy of remark,\r\nthat not more than three of the thirteen are, at present, deemed larger\r\nstates, in the peculiar sense of the word. There is no reason for\r\nsupposing, in the federal, like a state, legislature, the senate will\r\nbe intimidated or overawed, by the more numerous branch. A demagogue\r\nmay declaim, rave, menace and foam, with as little impression as the\r\nroaring billows produce upon the solid [9] beach. Were it not for this\r\nequality in one, and inequality in the other, a jealousy might be\r\nentertained of too perfect a coincidence of sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe convention has been censured for an excess of its authority. But\r\nwith no other power was it invested, than is possessed by every free\r\ncitizen of the states. Its office was to advise, and no further has\r\nit proceeded. Had it been even invested with full powers to amend the\r\npresent compact, their proposed plan would not have exceeded their\r\ntrust. Amendment, in parliamentary language, means either addition,\r\nor diminution, or striking out the whole, and substituting something\r\nin its room. The convention were not limited. The states did not tell\r\nthem, this article must stand, this must be struck out, and this may\r\nbe altered. The avowed object of a convention was to consult on the\r\nadditional power necessary to be vested in congress. But the members\r\nof this convention perceiving, from the experience of these states,\r\nfrom the history of ancient and modern states, and, I may add, from\r\nthe principles of human nature, that the same body of men ought not\r\nto make and execute laws; and that one body alone ought not to do\r\nthe first, have separated the executive, so far as was proper, from\r\nthe legislative; and this last they have divided into two branches,\r\ncomposed of different materials, distinct from, and totally independent\r\nof, each other.\r\n\r\nThe house of representatives(62) is to be the immediate choice of the\r\npeople, and one man is to represent 30,000 souls. In an affair of so\r\nmuch importance, and in districts containing so many suffrages, it is\r\nnot to be supposed, that a worthless character will succeed by those\r\narts, which have, sometimes, prevailed in county elections. It is to\r\nbe expected, that, in general, the people will choose men of talents\r\nand character. Were they even so inclined, they can choose none but\r\nof ripe age, who have been, at least, seven [10] years citizens of\r\nthe United States, and, at the time of election, residents of the\r\nrespective state. Whatever laws shall be proposed, or assented to\r\nby these men, are to bind themselves, their children, and their\r\nconnections. If a single man, or a party, shall propose a measure,\r\ncalculated to promote private interest, at the expense of public good,\r\nis it conceivable, that the whole house will be brought into the\r\nmeasure? Suppose it should. The measure cannot be adopted into a law,\r\nwithout the concurrence of another house, consisting of men still more\r\nselect, possessing superior qualifications of residence and age, and\r\nequally bound by the laws. After gaining the assent of the senate, the\r\nbill must be submitted to the objections of the president. He is not\r\nin any manner dependent on the legislature, which can, in no manner,\r\npunish him, except for some crime known to the laws. He is elected by\r\npersons chosen for that special purpose. He receives a compensation,\r\nwhich cannot be diminished or increased, during his continuance in\r\noffice. The term of his commission is limited to four years, unless\r\nhe shall have acted so as to merit the people’s favour. From the mode\r\nof his election, it is impossible he can intrigue to advantage; and,\r\nfrom the nature of other things, he will never succeed by bribery and\r\ncorruption. Like any other individual, he is liable to punishment.\r\nFinally, at the expiration of his office, he returns into the mass of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these circumstances, an idea is gone forth amongst\r\nthe enemies of the plan, and they labour to impress it on your minds,\r\nthat whatever power may be exercised by these delegates of the people,\r\nwill be used contrary to the interests of their constituents. This is\r\na supposition, so repulsive to my mind, that I wonder any man of the\r\nleast generosity, or reflection, can possibly adopt it. The assembly of\r\nMaryland, with respect to internal regulations, is almost omnipotent.\r\nAnd yet, is there a man who supposes the assembly would, intentionally,\r\npass laws injurious to the people? Why then should we distrust the\r\nfederal assembly, chosen for a short term, bound by the same ties, and\r\nselected on account of their talents and patriotism?\r\n\r\nBut, say the objectors, although we might probably confide with safety\r\nin congress, it is not consistent with prudence [11], without a\r\nmanifest necessity, to empower any men to do us an injury.\r\n\r\nWhenever the proposed plan delegates authority, which you imagine might\r\nsafely be denied, be assured, that a little reflection will suggest\r\nabundant reason for granting it. At the same time you may be convinced,\r\nthat, as some powers were not intended to be exercised, so they never\r\nwill be exercised, without absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nI have been amused by the writings of an avowed friend to the plan.\r\n“Let no man,” says he, “think of proposing amendments. Should each\r\nperson object, and should his objections prevail, not a title of the\r\nsystem will be left. You are to accept the whole, or reject the whole.”\r\nAfter speaking in this very sensible way, he advises the states to\r\nreject, with unanimity and firmness, the following provision.\r\n\r\n“Art. I, sect. 4. The times, places, and manner of holding elections\r\nfor senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state, by\r\nthe legislature thereof; _but the congress may, at any time, by law,\r\nmake or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing\r\nsenators_.”\r\n\r\nCan this writer imagine, that congress will presume to use this\r\npower, without the occurrence of some one or more of the cases, the\r\ncontemplation whereof induced the convention to create it. These are\r\nthe cases of invasion by a foreign power; of neglect, or obstinate\r\nrefusal, in a state legislature; of the prevalance of a party,\r\nprescribing so as to suit a sinister purpose, or injure the general\r\ngovernment. Others might perhaps occur in the convention. But these may\r\nsuffice to evince the propriety of such a power in the federal head. It\r\nwas never meant, that congress should at any time interfere, unless on\r\nthe failure of a state lagislature, or to alter such regulations as may\r\nbe obviously improper. The exercise of this power must at all times be\r\nso very invidious, that congress, will not venture upon it without some\r\nvery cogent and substantial reason. Let congress, even officiously,\r\nexert every power given by this clause, the representatives must still\r\nbe chosen by the people, and the senate by the state legislatures. The\r\nprovision cannot by any possibility admit of a different construction.\r\n[12]\r\n\r\nShould the bare appointment to congress have the magic to pervert\r\nthe tempers and principles of men, I perceive not the temptation\r\nfor abusing this, or any other of their powers. There are bad men\r\nto be found at times, in every numerous assembly. But, under all\r\ncircumstances, I predict, that, in congress, their party will be small.\r\nShould there be thither sent the most prostituted character, that\r\never acted, like a pest, to his own state; should he possess talents\r\nsuperior to the rest, I should have little dread of his influence,\r\nunless I could suppose, that a majority of like characters may be\r\nchosen. Even then, I repeat it—they will be under no temptation\r\nsufficient to influence a sensible mind; and no man of ripe age was\r\never yet wicked for the sake of wickedness alone.\r\n\r\nYou have heard, that, by the privilege of nominating persons to office,\r\nthe president will find the congress obsequious enough to pass any\r\nlaws, he shall think fit to propose. It is incumbent on the authors\r\nof this suggestion to show some interest in the president, inducing\r\nhim to propose prejudicial measures. I have remarked, that under the\r\nconstitution, his salary can be neither augmented nor curtailed,\r\nduring his commission; and, to change the constitution, is not in\r\nthe power of congress. Should he, however, devise, and endeavour to\r\nprocure, some dangerous act of the body, can we conceive, that this\r\nlure will be powerful enough to corrupt a majority in each house. No\r\nmember can be appointed to an office, created, or of which the profits\r\nshall be increased, during the time for which he was elected. And the\r\nexpectation of such, as may fall vacant, within four years, will hardly\r\ncorrupt even the smallest number, that can, in any possible case,\r\nbe a majority, in the two houses. To make the members of each house\r\nineligible to any other office whatever, would be even impolitic, on\r\naccount of its precluding these states from the services perhaps of\r\nits best men. And it would be unjust to deny men the possibility of\r\nbenefits, which might be attained by others less deserving.\r\n\r\nIn ascertaining and defining this obvious principle, the convention\r\nevidently pursued this obvious principle, that all [13] things, which\r\nconcern the union in general, should be regulated by the federal head;\r\nand that each state legislature should regulate those things, which\r\nconcern only its own internal government, together with the separate\r\ninterests of its citizens. The enemies of the proposed constitution\r\nhave deemed it material to shew, that such a one never existed before.\r\nIt does not indeed agree with definitions in books, taken from the\r\nAmphyctyonic council, the United Netherlands, or the Helvetic body.\r\nThey would therefore infer, that it is wrong. This mode of reasoning\r\ndeserves not a serious refutation. The convention examined those\r\nseveral constitutions, if such a thing they can be called. It found\r\nthem either woefully defective, as to their own particular object, or\r\ninapplicable to ours. Peradventure, our own articles of confederation,\r\nin theory, appear more perfect than any of them. These articles were\r\nmade according to rule; the legislative and executive authorities being\r\nvested in one assembly. The extreme caution of its framers to secure\r\nthe independence of the several states, on account of its principle,\r\nwas much to be commended. But experience having fully demonstrated\r\nthis constitution to be inadequate to the purposes for which it was\r\nframed, and a general conviction of its defects having occasioned the\r\nconvention, it is astonishing, that attempts are now made to prefer\r\nstill a theory, not founded on the nature of things, but derived merely\r\nfrom a few deplorable examples. If two branches in a state legislature\r\nbe proper, why, in the name of common sense, are they not so in a\r\nconfederate legislature?—Many instances of hasty unadvised proceedings\r\nof congress, as a legislature, have by other writers been adduced;\r\nand so long as mankind shall remain under the influence of passion or\r\ninterest, there will be such proceedings in every numerous assembly of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIt is universally, by good writers, agreed, that where any one\r\npolitical body possesses _full_ powers, legislative and executive,\r\nwhether it be a single man, or a select few, or a numerous assembly, it\r\nmatters not;—the government must, in a short time, become despotic.\r\nThat in a free government, therefore, the legislative and executive\r\nought to be ever distinct and separate, is a position in the Maryland\r\nde- [14] claration of rights. This hackneyed principle, has been urged,\r\nwith great confidence, against constituting the senate a council to the\r\npresident. It has been urged too, even by the men who would have the\r\nwhole power of the federal government centred in a single assembly. I\r\nmean the men who insist that the convention ought to have done no more\r\nthan advise in what manner the powers of the present congress should\r\nbe increased. Let us understand the principle in its proper extent. It\r\ndoes not follow, that a body, whose assent is required, in making laws,\r\nbut who cannot, by themselves, do any legislative act, may not be a fit\r\ncouncil to the supreme executive magistrate, deriving his authority,\r\nlike them, from the people, in no manner dependent on them, or the\r\nimmediate of the people, for any private advantage, and possessed of no\r\nshare in legislation, except that of offering his advice.\r\n\r\nThe objection to this part of the constitution, I confess, at first,\r\nappeared formidable. The reasons which I now conjecture to have\r\ninfluenced the convention, did not then occur. But I have long adhered\r\nto a maxim, which I warmly recommend to others—never to condemn,\r\nabsolutely, even within myself, any one kind, until I can hit upon\r\nsome other kind which I _conceive_ better. As no human institution can\r\npossess absolute perfection, it is an easy matter to espy some fault\r\nor defect in almost everything, which the wit of man can contrive, or\r\nat least, to reason plausibly against it. But this faculty of finding\r\nfaults is by no means sufficient to constitute the politician or\r\nstatesman. I deliberated what kind of council might be preferable,\r\nunder all circumstances, to the senate. The plainest thing in nature!\r\nExclaims he, who solves all difficulties at once. Why not appoint a\r\nbody to act as council and nothing else?\r\n\r\nOne reason, and that not very unpopular, is the great additional\r\nexpence. However, this reason I deem the lightest of all; and the\r\ngeneral proposition involves a great variety of other considerations.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to a council, that the members be free, as possible,\r\nfrom all bias, or improper influence. This separate and distinct\r\ncouncil must be elected by the people, or [15] by special electors; by\r\nthe legislature, or by one of its branches; or by some department; or\r\nby the president.\r\n\r\nThat the people should either make laws to bind themselves, or elect\r\npersons, without whose consent, no laws shall be made, is essential\r\nto their freedom. But universal experience forbids, that they should\r\nimmediately choose persons for the execution of the laws. Shall the\r\nlegislature then, or the senate, or the house of representatives,\r\nhave this appointment? A council thus chosen would be dependent on\r\nits electors; and it would be the same thing in many respects, as if\r\nthe legislature should execute its own laws. Can you believe, that a\r\ncouncil, chosen annually, or once in two or three years, would dare to\r\npursue, in all cases, the dictates of its own judgment, contrary to\r\nthe known will of those, who will soon have an opportunity of removing\r\nthem? Would they not be emulous to please leading men; and there not\r\nbe opened, at every period of election, a fine field for intrigue and\r\ncabal? There would be one way only of rendering a council, thus chosen,\r\nindependent of their electors; and that is, the choosing them for life,\r\nwith salaries, not to be augmented or diminished.\r\n\r\nAgainst choosing an executive for life the reasons are weighty indeed.\r\nShould they then hold their commissions during good behaviour, there\r\nmust be some tribunal to determine on that good behaviour; and what\r\nbody it can be, except the congress, would be difficult to decide.\r\nBesides good behaviour in a member of council is not determinable, like\r\nthat of a judge, which has relation to the laws, and things universally\r\nknown. In the office of the former, there is much left to discretion,\r\nthat I cannot conceive with what propriety he can hold it on the\r\ncondition of good behaviour. There can be no sure criterion, and the\r\ndecision must therefore unavoidably depend on the discretion or mere\r\nopinion of his judges, founded on no established principles whatever.\r\n\r\nA council, chosen by the president himself, would probably consist\r\nof creatures devoted to his will. I can discern no reason, wherefore\r\nany officer of the government [16] should make the appointment. There\r\nremains then only the people’s choosing electors, and placing the\r\ncouncil of the president on the same footing with himself. Here occurs\r\nthe objection of expence; and here again would arise the controversy\r\nrespecting equality of representation.\r\n\r\nThe senate, will, in all human likelihood, consist of the most\r\nimportant characters, men of enlightened minds, mature in judgment,\r\nindependent in their circumstances, and not deriving their principal\r\nsubsistence from their pay, as probably would the members of a board,\r\ndistinct and separate from all other public employments.\r\n\r\nI am not, therefore, barely reconciled to the article in question. It\r\ncommands my warmest admiration, and entire applause.\r\n\r\nIs there any power improperly trusted to that select assembly, in which\r\nall the states have equal interest, and to which they will assuredly\r\nmake a determined point of sending their best men? It is this\r\nequality, almost as much as any other circumstance, which recommends it\r\nas an executive council. The senate are to try impeachments. By their\r\nadvice only, may the president make treaties, appoint ambassadors,\r\nministers, counsels, judges of the supreme court, and officers, not\r\notherwise provided for in the constitution. Let us reflect, whether\r\nthese things could be better done, by any other body, and whether it be\r\nproper for any one man (suppose even the saviour of his country to be\r\nimmortal) to have the appointment of all those important officers. It\r\nhas always appeared to me, that neither one man, nor many men, should\r\npossess this transcendent authority, in a republic. A single man, in\r\nhigh power, if he always means right, can with difficulty discern the\r\ntrue characters of men. Continual efforts are made to impose on his\r\njudgment. But, indeed, a single man _generally_ confers by favour.\r\nIn a large assembly there is perhaps equal partiality; and elections\r\nare conducted by intrigue and cabal. A select assembly is open to\r\ndirect application; and although each may be supposed to entertain his\r\npartialities, he cannot recommend his favourites, without pointing\r\nout their essential qualifications and becoming, in some measure,\r\nresponsible for their conduct. It is here, that characters are most\r\nfairly [17] investigated, and appointments are most deliberately made.\r\nI appeal to universal experience, whether these remarks be not founded\r\non fact, and whether the most judicious appointments have not been made\r\nby small select assemblies. I confess, that the number of the senators\r\nfor this purpose only is excessive. But I can confidently rely on the\r\nextraordinary selection to compensate for the excess.\r\n\r\nThe power of the president is alarming peculiarly to that class, who\r\ncannot bear to view others in possession of that fancied blessing, to\r\nwhich, alas! they must themselves aspire in vain. They tell you, this\r\nsupreme magistrate, although he be called the modest name of president,\r\nand elected for only four years, will, in every essential, be an\r\nemperor, king, or stadt-holder at least; and that his dignity in a few\r\nyears, will become hereditary. Let us examine the foundation of this\r\nalarming prediction.\r\n\r\nBefore this appointment can be _entailed_, and before even the term\r\ncan be enlarged, the constitution must be changed, by consent of\r\nthe people. By what method, then, shall the president effect this\r\nalteration? Every citizen in the union will be a censor on his conduct.\r\nNot even his person is particularly protected; and the means of\r\noppression are little in his power. Let the jealousy of the people once\r\ntake the alarm, and, at the expiration of his term, he is dismissed, as\r\ninevitably as light succeeds to darkness. The election of a president\r\nis not carried on in a single assembly, where the several arts of\r\ncorruption may be essayed. He is elected by persons chosen on the same\r\nday, in thirteen different assemblies, in thirteen different states.\r\nAn elective monarchy has long been severely reprobated. But had the\r\ncountries, where it prevailed, enjoyed regulations like these, they\r\nwould perhaps, at this time, be preferred to the rules of hereditary\r\nsuccession, which have so often placed fools and tyrants on the throne.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that the president may possibly be continued for\r\nlife. He may so, provided he deserve it. If [18] not, he retires to\r\nobscurity, without even the consolation of having produced any of the\r\nconvulsions, attendant usually on grand revolutions. Should he be\r\nwicked or frantic enough to make the attempt, he atones for it, with\r\nthe certain loss of wealth, liberty or life.\r\n\r\nI return to the powers of congress. They are almost universally\r\nadmitted to be proper for a federal head, except only the _sweeping\r\nclause_, and the power of raising fleets and armies, without any stint\r\nor limitation, in time of peace. The clause runs thus:—\r\n\r\nART. I, sec. 8, par. the last. “To make all laws, which shall be\r\nnecessary and be proper for carrying into execution the foregoing\r\npowers, and all other powers vested by this constitution, in the\r\ngovernment of the United States, or in any department or officer\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nIt is apprehended, that this _sweeping clause_ will afford pretext, for\r\nfreeing congress from all constitutional restraints.\r\n\r\nI will not here again insist on the pledge we enjoy, in the common\r\ninterest, and sure attachment of the representatives and senate;\r\nsetting aside the little probability of a majority in each branch lying\r\nunder the same temptation. Consider the import of the words.\r\n\r\nI take the construction of these words to be precisely the same, as\r\nif the clause had preceded further and said, “No act of congress\r\nshall be valid, unless it have relation to the foregoing powers, and\r\nbe necessary and proper for carrying them into execution.” But say\r\nthe objectors, “The congress, being itself to judge of the necessity\r\nand propriety, may pass any act, which it may deem _expedient_, for\r\nany other purpose.” This objection applies with equal force to each\r\nparticular power, defined by the constitution; and, if there were a\r\nbill of rights, congress might be said to be the judge of that also.\r\nThey may reflect however, that every judge in the union, whether of\r\nfederal or state appointment, (and some persons would say every jury)\r\nwill have a right to reject any act, handed to him as a law, which he\r\nmay conceive repugnant to the constitution.\r\n\r\nIt may nevertheless strike you at first view, that a provision, so\r\nobviously apt to excite distrust, might have well [19] been omitted.\r\nSo indeed it might, were there a possibility of providing every thing,\r\nnecessary and proper, for carrying into effect the various powers,\r\nintended to be conferred. Without this general clause, it were easy to\r\nsuppose cases, wherein a particular clause might be incompetent to its\r\nown purpose.\r\n\r\nFor want of some plain and obvious distinctions, there has been vented\r\nso much senseless clamour against standing armies, that they are become\r\na political bugbear. A limited monarch, with the means of maintaining,\r\nat all times, an army devoted to his will, might soon trample on the\r\nnatural and civil rights of his subjects. Could the present congress\r\nfind means of augmenting the force, which it now maintains, which of\r\nyou, on that account, would experience the slightest anxiety? Which of\r\nall the European powers is destitute of an army? Which of them if they\r\nwere free, could be secure of remaining so without a standing force?\r\nI might go further, and demand, whether any of them have lost their\r\nliberties, by means of a _standing_ army? The troops, continually\r\nkept up in Great Britain, are formidable to its neighbors, and yet no\r\nrational Englishman apprehends the destruction of his rights. It is\r\ntrue, that he knows, these troops cannot be maintained, without the\r\nconsent of his representatives, annually obtained. But the necessity\r\nof an army he readily conceives; and the number he leaves to the\r\ndiscretion of parliament. Ought then an American to have greater fears\r\nof a president, than an Englishman has of his king? Or may he not trust\r\nhis representatives and the senate, with as much confidence, as the\r\nEnglishman reposes in the commons and lords?\r\n\r\nLet the federal head be constituted as it may, there can be no perfect\r\nsecurity, without both a land force, and naval armament. It is\r\nimpossible to say how much will, at all times of peace, be sufficient.\r\nWe have the same security against the abuse of this, as of any other\r\nauthority. The expenses of an army might indeed raise fears of a\r\ndifferent kind,—that we shall not be able to maintain force enough for\r\nthe most proper occasion.\r\n\r\nSuppose a limitation in time of peace. What then is to be done on\r\nthe prospect of a war? Should you make the [20] distinction between\r\nprofound peace and a _threatened_ war, who is there, but congress, to\r\ndetermine on the exigency? If you make no distinction, then it will be\r\nexpedient to declare war, at the instant in which the danger shall be\r\nconceived, in order that it may be lawful to prepare for only a just\r\ndefence. In fine, I consider this grand objection, as a mere pretext\r\nfor terrifying you, like children, with spectres and hobgoblins. It may\r\nbe material here to remark, that although a well regulated militia has\r\never been considered as the true defence of a free republic, there are\r\nalways honest purposes, which are not to be answered by a militia. If\r\nthey were, the burthen of the militia would be so great, that a free\r\npeople would, by no means, be willing to sustain it. If indeed it be\r\npossible in the nature of things, that congress shall, at any future\r\nperiod, alarm us by an improper augmentation of troops, could we not,\r\nin that case, depend on the militia, which is ourselves. In such a\r\ncase it would be ridiculous to urge that the federal government, is\r\ninvested with a power over the whole militia of the union. Even when\r\ncongress shall exercise this power, on the most proper occasions, it is\r\nprovided in the constitution, that each state shall officer and train\r\nits own militia.\r\n\r\nThe objections against the judiciary are probably more sincere. The\r\narticle has been generally misconceived, or misrepresented; and after\r\nbestowing much attention, I am not certain that I fully comprehend\r\nit. I am, however, at length satisfied, that no rational construction\r\ncan be given to this part of the proposed plan, either to warrant a\r\nrejection of the whole, or to place matters on a worse footing, than\r\nthey are at present.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary power is to be vested in one supreme court, fixed at the\r\nseat of government, with the ease and convenience of the people, the\r\ncongress may hereafter appoint inferior courts in each of the states.\r\nThe jurisdiction of this supreme court is to be partly original, and\r\npartly appellate. With respect to the extent of either, there can be no\r\npossible doubt, as there is neither ambiguity nor uncertainty in the\r\nrelative expressions. [21].\r\n\r\nThe original jurisdiction of the supreme court extends:—\r\n\r\n1. To all cases, in which may be concerned an ambassador, any public\r\nminister, or a consul.\r\n\r\n2. To all cases whatever, in which a state may be a party.—This second\r\ndivision maybe branched into 1. Cases between the United States, and\r\none or more of the individual states. 2. Cases between two or more\r\nstates. 3. Cases between a state and its own citizens. 4. Cases between\r\na state, and the citizens of another state. 5. Cases between a state,\r\nand a foreign state. 6. Cases between a state, and the citizens, or\r\nsubjects of a foreign state.\r\n\r\nThe appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court extends:—\r\n\r\n1. To all cases whatever between parties of every kind, in law and\r\nequity, arising under this constitution, and the laws of congress,\r\npassed agreeably thereto, and to treaties already, or hereafter to be,\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n2. To all cases of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n3. To all cases, in which the United States shall be a party.\r\n\r\n4. To all cases between citizens of different states.\r\n\r\n5. To all cases between citizens of the same state, claiming lands\r\nunder the grants of different states.\r\n\r\n6. To all cases between citizens of a state, and foreign states, or\r\ntheir citizens or subjects.\r\n\r\nOne doubt arising on the judiciary article is, whether in these cases\r\nof appellate jurisdiction, the appeal lies both from the state courts,\r\nand the inferior federal courts, or only from the former, or only from\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nAnother doubt is, whether the inferior courts are to be branches of\r\nthe supreme court, constituted for convenience, and having equal\r\njurisdiction, both original and appellate, with the supreme court,\r\nor whether the inferior courts are to be confined to an _original_\r\njurisdiction in those cases, wherein the supreme court has _appellate_\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI shall not presume to decide absolutely on the genuine construction\r\nof an article, which is said to have caused much private debate and\r\nperplexity. I am however fully persuaded, that, as the article speaks\r\nof an original and appellate jurisdiction, of a supreme court, and\r\ninferior courts; and, as there is no intimation of appeals from the\r\nseveral [22] state tribunals, the inferior federal courts are intended\r\nto have original jurisdiction in all cases, wherein the supreme court\r\nhas appellate jurisdiction; and the appeal lies only from them. I can,\r\nalmost, with confidence, maintain, that, as there is no express clause,\r\nor necessary implication, to oust the jurisdiction of state courts, an\r\naction, after the adoption of the plan, may be instituted in any court,\r\nhaving, at this time, a jurisdiction. And if an action be brought in\r\na state court, I do not, at present, perceive, that it can, in any\r\nmanner, be transferred to the supreme or inferior federal court.\r\n\r\nAccording then to the best of my judgment the affair stands thus. The\r\nsupreme federal court will have an exclusive original jurisdiction in\r\nall cases relative to the rights of ambassadors, other ministers, and\r\nconsuls; because, as I humbly conceive, the several state governments\r\nhave at this time nothing to do with these cases. With respect to the\r\ncases, in which a state may be party, the supreme federal court, and\r\nthe several state courts, will have, I conceive, concurrent original\r\njurisdiction, _provided a state may, at this time, institute an action\r\nin its own name, in the courts of another state_. The inferior federal\r\ncourts, and the state courts, will, I conceive, have concurrent\r\noriginal jurisdiction in all the enumerated cases wherein an appeal\r\nlies to the supreme court, _except only the cases created by or under\r\nthe proposed constitution, in which, as they do not now exist, the\r\ninferior federal courts will have exclusive jurisdiction_. From the\r\nstate inferior courts, I further apprehend, that an appeal will lie, in\r\nall cases, to their own high courts of appeal, as heretofore.\r\n\r\nA choice of jurisdictions has been ever esteemed a valuable right,\r\neven where there are both of the same kind. The purpose of extending\r\nso far the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, is to give every\r\nassurance to the general government, of a faithful execution of its\r\nlaws, and to give citizens, states, and foreigners, an assurance of the\r\nimpartial administration of justice. Without the salutary institution,\r\nthe federal government might frequently be obstructed, and its servants\r\nwant protection. It is calculated not as an engine of oppression, but\r\nto secure the blessings of peace and good [23] order. The provisions\r\nrespecting different states, their citizens, and foreigners, if not\r\nabsolutely necessary, are much to be applauded, The human mind is so\r\nframed, that the slightest circumstance may prevent the most upright\r\nand well known tribunal from giving complete satisfaction; and there\r\nmay happen a variety of cases, where the distrust and suspicion may not\r\nbe altogether destitute of a just foundation.\r\n\r\nOn these principles, an appeal as to fact is no less proper, than the\r\nappeal from judges of law. A jury, whose legal qualifications are\r\nonly property and ripe age, may more probably incur the imputation of\r\nweakness, partiality, or undue influence. But in regard to appeals, it\r\nis very material to remark, that congress is to make such regulations\r\nand exceptions, as upon mature deliberation, it shall think proper.\r\nAnd indeed, before such regulations and exceptions shall be made,\r\nthe manner of appeal will not be ascertained. Is it then to be\r\npresumed, that, in making regulations and exceptions, this appellate\r\njurisdiction shall be calculated as an engine of oppression, or to\r\nserve only the purpose of vexation and delay.\r\n\r\nAs the rod of Aaron once swallowed up the rods of the Egyptian\r\n_magi_, so also is it feared, that these federal courts, will, at\r\nlength, swallow up the state tribunals. A miracle, in one case, is as\r\nnecessary, as in the other.\r\n\r\nBut let not the officers of state courts be overmuch alarmed! The\r\ncauses, which, by possibility, may be(63) instituted in the federal\r\ncourts bear no comparison to the rest. [24] In the course of ten years,\r\nnot one action, that I know of, in Maryland, has concerned either\r\nanother state, or an ambassador, consul, or other minister. It is\r\nhoped, that actions by foreigners, will, in a few years, become much\r\nrarer than at any time heretofore, and these may still be determined in\r\nthe state courts. [25]\r\n\r\nA gentleman, as it is conjectured, in the law department of a\r\nneighboring state, has been pleased to infer, that fictions, similar to\r\nthose in the king’s bench and exchequer of England, will be contrived,\r\nto draw causes into the federal courts. He seems not aware, that, even\r\nin England, the established fictions of law are not of modern date.\r\nThey were ingenious devices, to remedy defects in the common law,\r\n_without the aid_\r\n\r\n_of parliament_. The fundamental principle however, with respect to\r\ntheir adoption, was, that they _consist with equity, and be requisite\r\nfor the advancement of justice_. Now every man, who would establish\r\nover his cause a jurisdiction in a federal court, must shew, that\r\nsuch cause comes under the description of the constitution. If he\r\ndo not, there will be wanting that equity, which is the support of\r\nlegal fiction. But can any man seriously imagine, that fiction will\r\nbe permitted, to give the judges a power of legislation, denied to\r\ncongress itself? Wherefore should the judges, holding their commissions\r\nduring good behaviour, be guilty of such gross falsehood, perjury,\r\nand breach of trust? Would there not be a general revolt against\r\nsuch barefaced impudent innovations. Away then with your trumpery\r\nof fictions! Accuse not the illustrious members of the convention\r\nof having in their contemplation such sophistry, pettifogging and\r\nchicane! But another fear is, that whatever actions may be instituted\r\nin the federal courts will there seek an admission, on account of a\r\nmore speedy decision. That man alone, “on whose brow shame is ashamed\r\nto sit,” will avow his opposition to a more speedy administration of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the trial by jury has been sanctified by the\r\nexperience of ages. It has been recognised by the constitution of\r\nevery state in the union. It is deemed the birthright of Americans; and\r\nit is imagined, that liberty cannot subsist without it. The proposed\r\nplan expressly adopts it, for the decision of all criminal accusations,\r\nexcept impeachment; and is silent with respect to the determination of\r\nfacts in civil causes.\r\n\r\nThe inference, hence drawn by many, is not warranted by the premises.\r\nBy recognising the jury trial in criminal cases, the constitution\r\neffectually provides, that it shall pre- [26] vail, so long as the\r\nconstitution itself shall remain unimpaired and unchanged. But,\r\nfrom the great variety of civil cases, arising under this plan of\r\ngovernment, it would be unwise and impolitic to say aught about it, in\r\nregard to these. Is there not a great variety of cases, in which this\r\ntrial is taken away in each of the states? Are there not many more\r\ncases, where it is denied in England? For the convention to ascertain\r\nin what cases it shall prevail, and in what others it may be expedient\r\nto prefer other modes was impracticable. On this subject a future\r\ncongress is to decide; and I see no foundation under Heaven for the\r\nopinion that congress will despise the known prejudices and inclination\r\nof their countrymen. A very ingenious writer of Philadelphia has\r\nmentioned the objections without deigning to refute that, which he\r\nconceives to have originated in “sheer malice.”\r\n\r\nI proceed to attack the whole body of anti-federalists in their strong\r\nhold. The proposed constitution contains no _bill of rights_.\r\n\r\nConsider again the nature and intent of a federal republic. It consists\r\nof an assemblage of distinct states, each completely organized for the\r\nprotection of its own citizens, and the whole consolidated, by express\r\ncompact, under one head, for the general welfare and common defence.\r\n\r\nShould the compact authorize the sovereign, or head to do all things\r\nit may think necessary and proper, then there is no limitation to its\r\nauthority; and the liberty of each citizen in the union has no other\r\nsecurity, than the sound policy, good faith, virtue, and perhaps proper\r\ninterests, of the head.\r\n\r\nWhen the compact confers the aforesaid general power, making\r\nnevertheless some special reservations and exceptions, then is the\r\ncitizen protected further, so far as these reservations and exceptions\r\nshall extend.\r\n\r\nBut, when the compact ascertains and defines the power delegated to the\r\nfederal head, then cannot this government, without manifest usurpation,\r\nexert any power not expressly, or by _necessary_ implication, conferred\r\nby the compact.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is so obvious and plain, that I am amazed any good man\r\nshould deplore the omission of a bill of rights.\r\n\r\n[27] When we were told, that the celebrated Mr. Wilson had advanced\r\nthis doctrine in effect, it was said, Mr. Wilson would not dare to\r\nspeak thus to a CONSTITUTIONALIST. With talents inferior to that\r\ngentleman’s, I will maintain the doctrine against any CONSTITUTIONALIST\r\nwho will condescend to enter the lists, and behave like a gentleman.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the idea of another most respectable character, that,\r\nas a bill of rights could do no harm, and might quiet the minds of many\r\ngood people, the convention would have done well to indulge them. With\r\nall due deference, I apprehend, that a bill of rights might not be this\r\ninnocent quieting instrument. Had the convention entered on the work,\r\nthey must have comprehended within it everything, which the citizens\r\nof the United States claim as a natural or a civil right. An omission\r\nof a single article would have caused more discontent, than is either\r\nfelt or pretended, on the present occasion. A multitude of articles\r\nmight be the source of infinite controversy, by clashing with the\r\npowers intended to be given. To be full and certain, a bill of rights\r\nmight have cost the convention more time, than was expended on their\r\nother work. The very appearance of it might raise more clamour than\r\nits omission,—I mean from those who study pretexts for condemning the\r\nwhole fabric of the constitution.—“What! (might they say) did these\r\nexalted spirits imagine, that the natural rights of mankind depend on\r\ntheir gracious concession. If indeed they possessed that tyrannic sway,\r\nwhich, the kings of England had once usurped, we might humbly thank\r\nthem for their _magna charta_, defective as it is. As that is not the\r\ncase, we will not suffer it to be understood, that their _new-fangled_\r\nfederal head shall domineer with the powers not excepted by their\r\nprecious bill of rights. What! if the owner of 1,000 acres of land\r\nthinks proper to fell one half, is it necessary to take a release from\r\nthe vendee of the other half? Just as necessary is it for the people to\r\nhave a grant of their natural rights from a government which derives\r\neverything it has, from the grant of the people.” [28]\r\n\r\nThe restraints laid on the state legislatures will tend to secure\r\ndomestic tranquility, more than all the bills, or declarations, of\r\nrights, which human policy could devise. It is very justly asserted,\r\nthat the plan contains an avowal of many rights. It provides that\r\nno man, shall suffer by expost facto laws or bills of attainder. It\r\ndeclares, that gold and silver only shall be a tender for specie debts;\r\nand that no law shall impair the obligation of a contract.\r\n\r\nI have here perhaps touched a string, which secretly draws together\r\nmany of the foes to the plan. Too long have we sustained evils,\r\nresulting from injudicious emissions of paper, and from the operation\r\nof tender laws. To bills of credit as they are now falsely called,\r\nmay we impute the entire loss of confidence between men. Hence it is,\r\nthat specie has, in a great degree, ceased its proper office, and\r\nbeen confined to speculations, baneful to the public, and enriching\r\na few enterprising sharp-sighted men, at the expence not only of the\r\nignorant, slothful, and needy, but of their country’s best benefactors.\r\nHence chiefly are the bankruptcies throughout America, and the\r\ndisreputable ruinous state of our commerce. Hence is it principally,\r\nthat America hath lost its credit abroad, and American faith become\r\na proverb. The convention plainly saw, that nothing short of a\r\nrenunciation of the right to emit bills of credit could produce that\r\ngrand consummation of policy, the RESTORATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE\r\nFAITH.\r\n\r\nWere it possible for the nations abroad to suppose Great Britain would\r\nemit bills on the terms whereon they have issued in America, how soon\r\nwould the wide arch of that mighty empire tumble into ruins? In no\r\nother country in the universe has prevailed the idea of supplying,\r\nby _promissory notes_, the want of coin, for commerce and taxes. In\r\nAmerica, indeed, they have heretofore served many valuable purposes.\r\nIt is this consideration, which has so powerfully attached to them\r\nmany well meaning honest citizens; and they talk of gratitude to paper\r\nmoney, as if it were a sensible benefactor, entitled to the highest\r\nrank and distinction; and as if, to abandon it, would be a deadly\r\nsin. But when everything demonstrates the season to be past; when\r\nthe credit of America, in all places, depends on the security she\r\nshall give to [29] contracts, it would be madness in the states to be\r\ntenacious of their right. So long as Europe shall believe we regard\r\nnot justice, gratitude and honour, so long will America labour under\r\nthe disadvantages of an individual, who attempts to make good his way\r\nthrough the world with a blasted reputation. To the man, who shall say,\r\n“it is of no consequence to consult national honour,” I only answer\r\nthus,—“If thy soul be so narrow and depraved, as to believe this, it\r\nwere a needless attempt to cure thee of thy error.”\r\n\r\nOn this subject there is no necessity for enlarging, to the people of\r\nmy native state; their conduct on a recent occasion having acquired\r\nthem great and deserved applause. Is it necessary to enlarge on the\r\npropriety of giving more efficient powers to a federal head? At this\r\nmoment, congress is little more than a name, without power to effect a\r\nsingle thing, which is the object of a confederate republic. Reflect\r\non the recent period, when, in a sister state, a numerous body of her\r\nfrantic citizens appeared armed for the destruction of a government,\r\nframed by the people. When that unhappy state was devoted to the\r\nmiseries of a civil war, did congress even dare to interpose? Conscious\r\nof its inability to protect, it could only await the result, in silence\r\nand in terror. It indeed ventured to _make application_ to the states\r\nfor a small body of troops, under the poor pretext of another, and a\r\nnecessary, destination. But, notwithstanding the universal contagion\r\nof the alarm, did the states, on _that_ occasion, comply with the\r\n_requisition_? Suppose even an invasion by a foreign power,—in what\r\nmanner could congress provide for its own defence? In the contemptible\r\nlight in which America has lately stood, is it reasonable to expect she\r\nwill be suffered to remain long in peace? The distance between the two\r\ncontinents is the only circumstance on which we can rely. All Europe is\r\nnow in suspence; and the result of your deliberations will instruct her\r\nin the part she shall act.\r\n\r\nWith amazement, her nations contemplate a scene, of which the world is\r\ntoo young to furnish a parallel. We assembled our sages, patriots, and\r\nstatesmen, to consult what mode of government is capable of producing\r\nthe greatest sum [30] of general good, with the least mixture of\r\ngeneral, and partial evil. Not that each individual in this august\r\nassembly was expected to offer a system; but that the product of their\r\njoint wisdom should be referred to the several states, to be adopted,\r\nor rejected, as the great body of the people shall determine on a free\r\nand full deliberation.\r\n\r\nAs the occasion was unparalleled so also is the plan, which, after many\r\nmonths of painful investigation, is submitted, with an unanimity, also\r\nunparalleled.\r\n\r\nIf there be any man, who approves the great outlines of the plan,\r\nand, at the same time, would reject it, because he views some of the\r\nminute parts as imperfect, he should reflect, that, if the states\r\nthink as he does, an alteration may be hereafter effected, at leisure.\r\nWhen the convention determined, that the whole should be received,\r\nor the whole fail, they did not on an arrogant conceit of their own\r\ninfallibility, but on the soundest principles of policy and common\r\nsense. Were each state legislature, or convention, to take it up,\r\narticle by article, and section by section, with the liberty of\r\nadopting some, and rejecting the rest, in all probability, so small\r\na part would be approved by nine states, on the narrow view which\r\neach has of the subject, and attached as each is to its own supposed\r\ninterest, that, in its mutilated condition, it would be worse than the\r\npresent confederation. For thirteen different assemblies, in that way,\r\nto approve so much of any plan whatever, as might merit the name of\r\nsystem, the convention well knew to be impossible. Were there any one\r\nbody of men, invested with full power, in behalf of the whole United\r\nStates, to consider, and amend the plan, then would it be proper to\r\ndebate it by sections, in the same manner as it was originally debated.\r\n\r\nWith a view to defeat totally the plan, another general convention\r\nis proposed; not with the power of giving a finishing hand to a\r\nconstitution; but _again_ to consider objections, to strike out, to\r\nadd, and _again_ to make their report to the several states.\r\n\r\nIn this way, there can never be an end. We must at last return to\r\nthis,—that whatever is agreed on, by the assembly appointed to\r\npropose, must be either adopted in the whole, or in the whole rejected.\r\n[31]\r\n\r\nThe idea of a new convention is started by some men, with the vain\r\nexpectation of having amendments made to suit a particular state, or\r\nto advance their own selfish views. Were this fatal idea adopted, I\r\nshould bid a last adieu to that elevated hope, which now inspires me,\r\nof living under the happiest form of government which the sun ever\r\nbeheld. Recollect again and again, that almost every state in the union\r\nmade a determined point of delegating its first characters to this\r\ngrand convention. Reflect upon the time spent in the arduous work, and\r\nthe sacrifices which those distinguished persons made to their country.\r\nShould the same men be deputed again, would they not, think you, with\r\nthe same unanimity, subscribe and recommend the same plan? So far as I\r\nhave been informed, those members, who, in the progression of the plan,\r\nhad opposed certain parts, and yet afterwards subscribed cheerfully\r\nto the whole, have, with the candour which becomes them, acknowledged\r\ntheir errors in debate. Even an illustrious character, who was of\r\nthe minority, consisting only of three, I have been told, has since\r\nregretted his refusal.\r\n\r\nSuppose then a second convention, with a different choice of delegates.\r\nThese too would either speedily subscribe, or they might propose some\r\nother system, to be debated, paragraph by paragraph, in thirteen\r\ndifferent assemblies; and then there would be the same probability\r\nof a mutilated plan; or they would propose something, to be adopted\r\nor rejected in the whole; and there would be the same necessity of\r\nanother convention. Besides, as the second convention, if it consist\r\nof different men, must _inevitably_ be inferior to the first, there\r\nis little probability that their work will be superior. Never again,\r\nin an assembly constituted as that was, will there be found the same\r\nliberality of sentiment, “the same spirit of amity, and the same mutual\r\ndeference and concession.”\r\n\r\nIf it be contended, that the second, being possessed of the various\r\nobjections from the several states, must be better able to determine, I\r\nwould ask, what conduct this second convention should adopt? Are they\r\nto take the proposed plan, and strike out every thing objected to by\r\nnine states? Or may they likewise adopt and recommend the entire plan?\r\nIn short, to [32] appoint a second convention, merely to consult and\r\npropose, would be the most absurd expedient, that ever, in a matter of\r\nthis amazing magnitude, was proposed. Does any man then entertain the\r\nthought of another kind of convention, invested with full powers to\r\nconsult, amend, adopt, and confirm? A scheme like this was never yet,\r\nI trust, in agitation. But, if it were, I would propose this single\r\nquestion. Whether is it better to amend, before it be tried, that plan,\r\nwhich may be termed the result of the wisdom of America, or leave it to\r\nbe amended, at leisure, as mature experience shall direct?\r\n\r\nAlthough a very great variety of ostensible objections have been\r\npublicly offered, the real and sincere objections are hardly ever\r\ndisclosed in private. There is a class, opposed to the union of\r\n_thirteen different states_, and the reason they assign, is the vast\r\nextent of our territory. Let us consider well their objection.\r\n\r\nTo consolidate the whole thirteen states into a single organization,\r\nwas out of the convention’s contemplation,—for two unanswerable\r\nreasons. In the first place, they were satisfied, that not one of\r\nthe states would renounce its sovereignty. In the next place, they\r\nconsidered, that, in a single government, with a great extent of\r\nterritory, the advantages are most unequally diffused. As the extreme\r\nparts are scarcely sensible of its protection, so are they scarcely\r\nunder its domination. It is generally agreed, that a great extended\r\nnation can long continue under no _single_ form of government, except a\r\ndespotism into which, either a republic, or a limited monarchy, will\r\nbe certain to degenerate. And hence, if I understand the man who styles\r\nhimself a _Centinel_, he insinuates, that, if these states will persist\r\nin remaining under one head, they must soon fall under the dominion of\r\na despot. But, my fellow-citizens, in a confederate\r\nrepublic, consisting of distinct states, completely organized within\r\nthemselves, and each of no greater extent than is proper for a\r\nrepublican form, almost all the blessings of government are equally\r\ndiffused. Its protection extends to the remotest corner, and there\r\nevery man is under restraint of laws. [33]\r\n\r\nA true federal republic is always capable of accession by the peaceable\r\nand friendly admission of new single states. _Its true size is neither\r\ngreater nor less than that, which may comprehend all the states, which,\r\nby their contiguity, may become enemies, unless united under one common\r\nhead, capable of reconciling all their differences._ Such a government\r\nas this, excels any single government, extending over the same\r\nterritory, as a band of brothers is superior to a band of slaves, or as\r\nthirteen common men, for the purposes of agriculture, would be superior\r\nto a giant, enjoying strength of body equal to them all.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a balance has long influenced the politics of Europe. But\r\nhow much superior to this almost impracticable balance would be a\r\ngeneral league, constituting a kind of federal republic, consisting of\r\nall the independent powers of Europe, for preventing the impositions\r\nand encroachments of one upon another! A true and perfect confederate\r\ngovernment, however, in her situation, is not to be attained; although\r\nthe great soul of HENRY THE FOURTH is said to have conceived the idea.\r\n\r\nShall America then form one grand federal republic? Or shall she, after\r\nexperiencing the benefits of even an imperfect union, and when a union\r\nthe most perfect is requisite for her permanent safety;—shall she, in\r\nthis situation, divide into thirteen contemptible single governments,\r\nexposed to every insult and wrong from abroad, and watching each\r\nother’s motions, with all the captiousness of jealous rivals? Or shall\r\nshe divide into two or more federal republics, actuated by the same\r\nmalignant dispositions? In either of these cases, after struggling\r\nthrough infinite toils, difficulty, and danger, should the thirteen\r\nsingle states be, at last, delivered from foreign foes, they will fall\r\nupon each other; and no man can predict, what forms of government, or\r\ndivision of territory, shall finally obtain——. Two or three federal\r\nrepublics might possibly retain their independence. But they would\r\nbe in the same situation, with respect to each other, as France,\r\nEngland, and Spain, scarcely ever free from war; practicing the arts\r\nof dissimulation and intrigue; in vain striving to impose, by endless\r\nnegotiation; and, after all, relying only on the immense naval and land\r\nforces, which they continually maintain. [34]\r\n\r\nLet us then, my countrymen, embrace those blessings which Providence\r\nis ready to shower on us. Open and extend your views! Let the prospect\r\ncomprehend the present and future generations, yourselves, your\r\nchildren, your relatives, your fellow-citizens, dwellers on the same\r\ncontinent, and inhabitants of the whole terraqueous globe.\r\n\r\nWith the prospect of my country’s future glory, presented to my\r\nglowing imagination, it is difficult to resist the strong impulse of\r\nenthusiasm. But it is neither _my_ talent, nor desire, to mislead. I\r\nwish only to impress the genuine advantages of the proposed plan; and,\r\nif possible, to rouse every man from that supineness, into which he is\r\nlulled by the present deceitful calm. To acquit themselves, like men,\r\nwhen visible danger assails; and, when it is repelled, to sink like\r\nsavages, into indolence, is said to be characteristic of Americans. I\r\nam not, however, one of those, who imagine a necessity for embracing\r\nalmost any scheme, which the convention might have devised, for giving\r\nto the union more efficient powers. Had the plan, they have proposed,\r\ncontained the seeds of much, though distant, evil, perhaps a _faithful\r\npatriot_ might address you thus:\r\n\r\n“Let us not, my friends, in a fit of unmanly apprehension, betray\r\nthat immense charge, with which Americans, at this day are entrusted!\r\nLet us confide in _the wisdom of our great men_, with the assistance\r\nof Heaven, to establish yet our safety and happiness! Let us, in the\r\nmeantime, sustain all our evils, with resignation and firmness. Let us\r\nhope, that no foreign power, or lawless internal combinations, shall\r\ndo us a mighty injury! Let us be frugal, economical, industrious! Let\r\nus suspend the cruel collection of debts! Let commerce continue to\r\ndroop! Let us awhile submit even to infamy; and turn a callous ear\r\nto the indignant reproaches of our late faithful and affectionate\r\nservants, friends and benefactors.”\r\n\r\nTo this purpose might a man plausibly declaim; provided the proposed\r\nplan contained many and great faults; provided it were not calculated\r\nto promote the general good, without violating the _just rights_\r\nof a single individual; and provided it were not the best, which,\r\nunder all circumstances, could be reasonably expected. It was the\r\nparting declaration of [35] the American NESTOR, to his exalted\r\nfellow-labourers, that “he would subscribe, because he thought it\r\ngood, and because he did not know, but it was the best that could be\r\ncontrived.” My own declaration, which would be the same, were I now\r\nstanding on the verge of eternity, is, that if the whole matter were\r\nleft to my discretion, I would not change a single part. On reflection,\r\nI was pleased with the conduct of the Virginia and Maryland assemblies,\r\nin appointing distant days for the meeting of their state conventions.\r\nNot that I greatly admired the supposed motive; but because I sincerely\r\nwished every man might have time to comprehend and weigh the plan,\r\nbefore the ultimate decision of these two states should be pronounced.\r\nThe longer it is contemplated, after it is understood, the greater, I\r\nam persuaded, will be the approbation of those, who wish the public\r\ngood, and to whose private views and expectations, nothing, which tends\r\nto promote that good, can be greatly detrimental.\r\n\r\nBut alas! My fellow citizens, on the adoption of this fatal plan,\r\nand when every part of the great complicated machine shall be put in\r\nmotion, the lustre of our state assemblies will be diminished by the\r\nsuperior splendour of the federal head. This single consideration,\r\nalthough many hesitate to avow it, will cause more opposition, than all\r\nthe rest united. Weigh well the objection. If ever it be material to\r\ninquire, by whom reasons are adduced, it is on this peculiar occasion.\r\nFrom the objection itself, may perhaps be discerned the danger we are\r\nopposed to, from the secret views and selfish considerations of the\r\nobjector.\r\n\r\nWhat at this moment to the nations abroad is the state of Maryland? The\r\npoor member of a defenceless system of petty republics. In what light\r\nis she viewed by her sister states? Whatever rank she now possesses,\r\nwill remain after the great alteration of the system. They will all\r\nrise or fall in the proportion which now exists. What then are the\r\npowers an individual state will lose? She will no longer be able to\r\ndeny congress that, which congress, at this moment, has a right to\r\ndemand. She will have no power to enter into a treaty, alliance, or\r\nconfederation. She shall, in time of war, grant no letters of marque\r\nand reprisal. She shall [36] coin no money, emit no bills of credit,\r\nnor make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts.\r\nShe shall pass no bill of attainder, or ex post facto law, or law\r\nimpairing the obligation of a contract. She shall grant no title of\r\nnobility. She shall not, _without consent of congress_, lay any duty\r\non imports or exports, except what may be necessary for executing her\r\ninspection laws. She shall not, _without consent of congress_, lay any\r\nduty on tonnage, keep troops or(64) ships of war, in time of peace;\r\nenter into any agreement, or compact, with another state, or with a\r\nforeign power; or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such\r\nimminent danger, as will not admit of delay.\r\n\r\nOf the several powers, from which an individual state is thus\r\nrestrained, some are improper to be used at all; others belong not even\r\nnow to the individual states; and the rest are strictly proper for only\r\nthe federal head. The aversion from ceding them to congress, is just\r\nas reasonable as in a state of nature would be the reluctance of an\r\nindividual to relinquish any of his natural rights, upon entering into\r\na state of society. The principle, on which, at length, he surrenders,\r\nis the necessity of every one’s making a cession of some rights,\r\nto enable the sovereign to protect the rest. Each state is fully\r\nsensible, that she cannot protect herself; and yet she would enjoy the\r\nadvantages of an union, without making the necessary contributions. To\r\ndiscern how preposterous is the idea, requires not more than a moment’s\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nFor the honour of my countrymen, I hope this extreme reluctance to\r\nsurrender power is confined to those, whose ambition, or private\r\ninterest, would have all things subservient to the omnipotence of\r\nassembly. In the few years that the state constitutions have endured,\r\nhas not everyone seen pregnant proofs of the vain love of domination?\r\nHas he not also seen decisive marks of overbearing secret influence?\r\nWhere are the instances of exalted patriotism? But I forbear. [37]\r\nFar from me is the wish to cast wantonly one stinging or disagreeable\r\nreflection. The subject naturally required the general remark, and I\r\nhope, this short hint may be excused.\r\n\r\nIs there a possible advantage to be derived to the public, from a\r\nsingle state’s exercising powers proper only for the federal head;\r\nsuppose even each state should use them properly and alike; which,\r\nin the nature of things, is not to be expected? If there be men, who\r\ndelight in parliamentary warfare; who choose a fair wide field for\r\ndisplaying their talents; who wish to see every servant of the public\r\nprostrate before them; whose ears soothed by humble supplication; they\r\nmay still enjoy rich sources of gratification. Are not the regulations\r\nof property, the regulations of the penal law, the protection of the\r\nweak, the promotion of useful arts, the whole internal government of\r\ntheir respective republics; are not these the main objects of every\r\nwise and honest legislature? Are not these things still in their power;\r\nand, whilst free from invasion or injuries abroad, are not these almost\r\nthe only things, in which sovereignty is exercised?\r\n\r\nThat the state legislatures will soon “drop out of sight,” is an idea\r\nmost extravagant and absurd; because, in addition to the importance\r\nof their duties, the very existence of the congress depends upon\r\nthem. That they will, at least, dwindle into something like city\r\ncorporations, is an apprehension, founded on no better principle. May\r\nthe Ruler of the universe inspire them with wisdom to discharge those\r\nnumerous and extensive duties, which they will find remaining. To do\r\nthis, as they ought, will be far preferable to the(65) breaking all\r\nuseful national measures, and marring the concerns of a continent.\r\nTo do this, as they ought, will afford more true pleasure to a good\r\nmind, than the carrying, by consummate eloquence and address, the\r\nmost interesting federal measure, which cannot be contrived by an\r\nenlightened honest politician, in a state assembly, possessing all its\r\ndarling sovereignties!\r\n\r\nYou have been assured, that, soon as this fatal plan shall [38]\r\nsucceed, an host of rapacious collectors will _invade_ the land; that\r\nthey will wrest from you the hard product of your industry, turn out\r\nyour children from their dwellings, perhaps commit your bodies to a\r\njail; and your own immediate representatives will have no power to\r\nrelieve you. This is the mere phrenzy of declamation, the ridiculous\r\nconjuration of spectres and hobgobblins!\r\n\r\nTo the five per cent. impost most of the states have more than once\r\ngiven their assent. This is the only tax which congress wishes\r\nimmediately to impose. Of the imposition of assessment, capitation, or\r\ndirect taxes of any kind, the congress entertains no idea at present;\r\nand although it be proper for the federal head to possess this power\r\nin reserve, nothing but some unforeseen disaster will ever drive them\r\nto such ineligible expedients. Setting aside the immediate advantages\r\nof revived credit and trade, and the increased value of your property\r\nand labour, you will be delivered, in a great measure, from that load\r\nof direct taxation, which has been so unequally borne, and produced so\r\nlittle substantial good.\r\n\r\nPermit me to demand, what mighty benefit has resulted from the exercise\r\nof those sovereign rights, that, in general, you should be loth to\r\nresign them? Has not a perpetual clamour been kept up (it matters not\r\nwhether justly or otherwise) concerning the enormous impositions on\r\nthe people? And what are the advantages derived to the people of the\r\nrespective states, to the union, or to meritorious individuals?\r\n\r\nHas not the far greater part of a state’s internal expences been\r\nowing to the extreme length of sessions? Have not these sessions been\r\nconsumed in disgusting altercation, and in passing laws, serving to\r\nlittle better purpose, than to swell the statute book, encourage a\r\nnegligence of duty, and obstruct the administration of justice?\r\n\r\nTo trace each real and ostensible objection up to its proper course,\r\nwould be a task equally invidious, irksome and unnecessary. The\r\ncharacters of the principal advocates and opponents are well known. To\r\nhim who declines not a public avowal of his sentiments, some credit is\r\ndue, for his candour; and he is entitled to your patient attention.\r\nBut, he that prefers a secret corner, for dealing forth his ob- [39]\r\njections, and expositions, should be heard with caution and distrust.\r\nIt is in a land of slavery alone, where truth shuns the open day.—Each\r\nside has imputed to the other illiberal and selfish motives. Consider\r\nthen the particular interests of each; and bear this in your minds,\r\nthat an interest may be either honourable and praiseworthy, or directly\r\nthe reverse.\r\n\r\nYou have been told that the proposed plan was calculated peculiarly for\r\nthe rich. In all governments, not merely despotic, the wealthy must,\r\nin most things, find an advantage, from the possession of that, which\r\nis too much the end and aim of mankind. In the proposed plan, there\r\nis nothing like a discrimination in their favour. How this amazing\r\nobjection is to be supported, I am at a loss to conjecture. Is it a\r\njust cause of reproach, that the constitution effectually secures\r\nproperty? Or would the objectors introduce a general scramble? In\r\neligibility to office, in suffrage, and in every other civil right, men\r\nare all on terms of perfect equality. And yet, notwithstanding this\r\njust equality, each man is to pay taxes in proportion to his ability,\r\nor his expences.\r\n\r\nA still more surpassing objection remains to be considered. “This\r\nnew constitution, so much bepraised, and admired, will commence in a\r\nmoderate aristocracy. To a corrupt and oppressive one the transition\r\nis easy, and inevitable, unless some Cæsar, or a Cromwell, in their\r\nstead, shall make a seizure of their liberties. As to the house of\r\nrepresentatives, they will either be insignificant spectators of the\r\ncontest between the president and the senate, or their weight will be\r\nthrown in to one of the scales.”\r\n\r\nNo man, indeed, has exactly used these words; but they contain the sum\r\nand scope of several recent publications.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my remarks, I have already said enough to expose the\r\nfutility of certain objections, which are ushered to the world, under\r\nthe auspices of a pair of honourable names. Notwithstanding the care\r\nand pomposity, with which they are circulated, it is not worth while to\r\ndraw invidious comparison. One gentleman, whose name is thus _freely_\r\nused, I think, calls the house of representatives a mere [40] shred,\r\nor rag of representation. Does he consider the distinction between the\r\nobjects of a confederate republic, and of a single government? It is\r\na poor return for that singular respect which the convention paid to\r\nthe majesty of the people, in contriving, that congress shall not only\r\nbe a representation of states, as heretofore, but also an immediate\r\nrepresentation of the people. Were 5, 10, or even 20,000, the ratio\r\nproposed, then peradventure the honourable objector might clamour about\r\nthe expence of a mobbish legislature.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the new government, constructed on the broad basis\r\nof equality, mutual benefits, and national good, is not calculated to\r\nsecure a single state all her natural advantages at the expence of the\r\nnatural and acquired advantages of her respectable brethren of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHis real objection against constituting the senate an executive\r\ncouncil arises, I conceive, from the equality of representation. As\r\nto the trite maxim, that the legislative and executive ought ever\r\nto be distinct and separate, I would, in addition to my foregoing\r\nobservations on this head, refer him to Montesquieu’s chapter on\r\nthe English government. I could wish, the writings of that great\r\nman, and of Judge Blackstone, so often either copied, or cited for\r\nconclusive authority, were better understood. Should a second, or a\r\nthird convention, be obtained, the aforesaid honourable gentlemen can\r\nnever be _fully_ indulged in their main object of a proportionate\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe examples of a genuine aristocracy are rare. They were founded in\r\ntimes of profound ignorance, and when the mass of property was in\r\nthe hands of a few, whilst the rest pined in want and wretchedness.\r\nOne European aristocratic government, if such it can be called, has\r\ngrown out of the original defective form, the offspring of necessity,\r\nand commenced amidst the horrors of a civil war. Although the people\r\nof that country fought, and intended, to be free, their compact of\r\ngovernment never was complete; they did not attend to the principle\r\nof rotation, and checks; and a genuine representation did never there\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nAn aristocracy can perhaps subsist with only a moderate extent of\r\nterritory and population. But it is a farce to talk of an aristocracy;\r\nwhen there are two branches, so dif- [41] ferently formed; when the\r\nmembers of each are chosen for a reasonable term; and when their\r\nreappointment depends on the good opinion of their countrymen. It is\r\nnot in nature, that a man with the least portion of _common_ sense\r\ncan believe the people of America will consent to such a deplorable\r\nchange in their constitution, as shall confine all power to a few noble\r\nfamilies, or that, without their consent, the change will be effected,\r\nby internal policy, or force.\r\n\r\nWhilst mankind shall believe freedom to be better than slavery;\r\nwhilst our lands shall be generally distributed, and not held by a\r\nfew insolent barons, on the debasing terms of vassalage; whilst we\r\nshall teach our children to read and write; whilst the liberty of the\r\npress, that grand palladium, which tyrants are compelled to respect,\r\nshall remain; whilst a spark of public love shall animate even a small\r\npart of the people; whilst even self-love shall be the general ruling\r\nprinciple; so long will it be impossible for an aristocracy to arise\r\nfrom the proposed plan.—Should Heaven, in its wrath, inflict blindness\r\non the people of America; should they reject this fair offer of\r\npermanent safety and happiness; to predict what species of government\r\nshall at last spring from disorder, is beyond the short reach of\r\npolitical foresight.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my fellow citizens, that no overweening self conceit,\r\nno vain ambition, no restless meddling spirit, has produced this\r\naddress. Long had I waited to see this vast question treated, as it\r\ndeserves; and the publication disseminated in my native state. Many\r\njudicious observations had appeared in newspapers and handbills. But\r\nno publication, that I have seen, has gone fully into the merits,\r\nconsidered the objections, and explained that, which is doubtful and\r\nobscure. On this account I, at length, made the attempt. That my\r\nperformance is equal to my wishes, I can by no means believe. I have,\r\nhowever, a consolation in reflecting, that it will be difficult for\r\nany man to demonstrate, that, in this business, I have a particular\r\ninterest. In many of my remarks, I have been anticipated by writings,\r\nwhich I have seen; and I have collected ma- [42] terials, wherever I\r\ncould find them. Could I be convinced, that I have said nothing, which\r\nhad not before been said or thought by thousands, the reflection would\r\nyield far less mortification than pleasure.\r\n\r\n  ARISTIDES.\r\n\r\n  Annapolis, January 1st, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter on the Federal Constitution, October 16, 1787, By Edmund\r\nRandolph [Richmond: Printed by Augustin Davis, 1787.]\r\n\r\n  16 mo. pp. 16.\r\n\r\n  Edmund Randolph was a member of the Annapolis, Philadelphia, and\r\n  Virginia Conventions, in all of which he took a prominent though\r\n  equivocal position. His letter on the Constitution was widely\r\n  circulated in the newspapers, and was printed in pamphlet form as\r\n  above, a copy of which is in the Library of Congress, but cannot be\r\n  found, so I am compelled to give the title from Sabin’s _Dictionary\r\n  of Books relating to America_.\r\n\r\n  “I do not know what impression the letter may make in Virginia. It\r\n  is generally understood here that the arguments contained in it in\r\n  favor of the Constitution are much stronger than the objections which\r\n  prevent his assent. His arguments are forcible in all places, and\r\n  with all persons. His objections are connected with his particular\r\n  way of thinking on the subject, in which many of the adversaries to\r\n  the Constitution do not concur.” _Madison to Washington_, Jan. 25,\r\n  1788.\r\n\r\n  P. L. F.\r\n\r\n  RICHMOND, Oct. 10, 1787.\r\n\r\n  THE HONORABLE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES:\r\n\r\n  _Sir_,—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitution which I enclosed to the general assembly in a late\r\nofficial letter, appears without my signature. This circumstance,\r\nalthough trivial in its own nature, has been rendered rather important\r\nto myself at least by being misunderstood by some, and misrepresented\r\nby others.—As I disdain to conceal the reasons for withholding my\r\nsubscription, I have always been, still am, and ever shall be, ready to\r\nproclaim them to the world. To the legislature, therefore, by whom I\r\nwas deputed to the federal convention, I beg leave now to address them;\r\naffecting no indifference to public opinion, but resolved not to court\r\nit by an unmanly sacrifice of my own judgment.\r\n\r\nAs this explanation will involve a summary, but general review of our\r\nfederal situation, you will pardon me, I trust, although I should\r\ntransgress the usual bounds of a letter.\r\n\r\nBefore my departure for the convention, I believed, that the\r\nconfederation was not so eminently defective, as it had been supposed.\r\nBut after I had entered into a free communication with those who were\r\nbest informed of the condition and interest of each State; after I\r\nhad compared the intelligence derived from them with the properties\r\nwhich ought to characterize the government of our union, I became\r\npersuaded, that the confederation was destitute of every energy, which\r\na constitution of the United States ought to possess.\r\n\r\nFor the objects proposed by its institution were, that it should be a\r\nshield against foreign hostility, and a firm resort against domestic\r\ncommotion; that it should cherish trade, and promote the prosperity of\r\nthe States under its care.\r\n\r\nBut these are not among the attributes of our present union. Severe\r\nexperience under the pressure of war—a ruinous weakness manifested\r\nsince the return of peace; and the contemplation of those dangers,\r\nwhich darken the future prospect, have condemned the hope of grandeur\r\nand of safety under the auspices of the confederation.\r\n\r\nIn the exigencies of war, indeed, the history of its effects is but\r\nshort; the final ratification having been delayed until the year\r\n1781. But however short, this period is distinguished by melancholy\r\ntestimonies of its inability to maintain in harmony, the social\r\nintercourse of the States, to defend congress against encroachments on\r\ntheir rights, and to obtain by requisitions, supplies to the federal\r\ntreasury, or recruits to the federal armies. I shall not attempt\r\nan enumeration of the particular instances; but leave to your own\r\nremembrance and the records of congress the support of the assertions.\r\n\r\nIn the season of peace too, not many years have elapsed; and yet each\r\nof them has produced fatal examples of delinquency, and sometimes of\r\npointed opposition to federal duties. To the various remonstrances of\r\ncongress, I appeal, for a gloomy, but unexaggerated narrative of the\r\ninjuries which our faith, honor and happiness, have sustained by the\r\nfailure of the States.\r\n\r\nBut these evils are past; and some may be led by an honest zeal to\r\nconclude that they cannot be repeated. Yes, sir, they will be repeated\r\nas long as the confederation exists, and will bring with them other\r\nmischiefs springing from the same source, which cannot yet be foreseen\r\nin their full array of terror.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the constitution and laws of the several States, it is\r\nimmediately discovered that the law of nations is unprovided with\r\nsanctions in many cases, which deeply affect public dignity and public\r\njustice. The letter however of the confederation does not permit\r\ncongress to remedy these defects, and such an authority, although\r\nevidently deducible from its spirit, cannot without violation of the\r\nsecond article, be assumed. Is it not a political phenomenon, that\r\nthe head of the confederacy should be doomed to be plunged into war,\r\nfrom its wretched impotency to check offences against this law; and\r\nsentenced to witness in unavailing anguish the infraction of their\r\nengagements to foreign sovereigns?\r\n\r\nAnd yet this is not the only grievous point of weakness. After a war\r\nshall be inevitable, the requisitions of congress for quotas of men or\r\nmoney, will again prove unproductive and fallacious. Two causes will\r\nalways conspire to this baneful consequence.\r\n\r\n1. No government can be stable, which hangs on human inclination alone,\r\nunbiased by the coercion; and 2, from the very connection between\r\nStates bound to proportionate contributions, jealousies and suspicions\r\nnaturally arise, which at least chill the ardor, if they do not excite\r\nthe murmurs of the whole. I do not forget indeed, that by one sudden\r\nimpulse our part of the American continent has been thrown into a\r\nmilitary posture, and that in the earlier annals of the war, our armies\r\nmarched to the field on the mere recommendations of congress. But ought\r\nwe to argue from a contest, thus signalized by the magnitude of its\r\nstake, that as often as a flame shall be hereafter kindled, the same\r\nenthusiasm will fill our legions, or renew them, as they may be filled\r\nby losses?\r\n\r\nIf not, where shall we find protection? Impressions, like those, which\r\nprevent a compliance with requisitions of regular forces, will deprive\r\nthe American republic of the services of militia. But let us suppose\r\nthat they are attainable, and acknowledge as I always shall, that they\r\nare the natural support of a free government. When it is remembered,\r\nthat in their absence agriculture must languish; that they are not\r\nhabituated to military exposures and the rigour of military discipline,\r\nand that the necessity of holding in readiness successive detachments,\r\ncarries the expense far beyond that of enlistments—This resource ought\r\nto be adopted with caution.\r\n\r\nAs strongly too, am I persuaded, that the requisitions for money will\r\nnot be more cordially received. For besides the distrust, which would\r\nprevail with respect to them also; besides the opinion, entertained\r\nby each state of its own liberality and unsatisfied demands against\r\nthe United States, there is another consideration not less worth of\r\nattention—the first rule for determining each quota of the value of\r\nall lands granted or surveyed, and of the buildings and improvements\r\nthereon. It is no longer doubted that an equitable, uniform mode of\r\nestimating that value is impracticable; and therefore twelve States\r\nhave substituted the number of inhabitants under certain limitations,\r\nas the standard according to which money is to be furnished. But under\r\nthe subsisting articles of the union, the assent of the thirteenth\r\nState is necessary, and has not yet been given. This does of itself\r\nlessen the hope of procuring a revenue for federal uses; and the\r\nmiscarriage of the impost almost rivets our despondency.\r\n\r\nAmidst these disappointments, it would afford some consolation, if when\r\nrebellion shall threaten any State, an ultimate asylum could be found\r\nunder the wing of congress. But it is at least equivocal whether they\r\ncan intrude forces into a State, rent asunder by civil discord, even\r\nwith the purest solicitude for our federal welfare, and on the most\r\nurgent entreaties of the State itself. Nay the very allowance of this\r\npower would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and men.\r\n\r\nTo these defects of congressional power, the history of man has\r\nsubjoined others not less alarming. I earnestly pray that the\r\nrecollection of common sufferings, which terminated in common glory,\r\nmay check the sallies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friendship\r\nbetween the States. But I cannot presume, that we are superior to\r\nthose unsocial passions, which under like circumstances have infested\r\nmore ancient nations. I cannot presume, that through all time, in the\r\ndaily mixture of American citizens with each other, in the conflicts\r\nfor commercial advantages, in the discontents which the neighborhood\r\nof territory has been seen to engender in other quarters of the\r\nglobe, and in the efforts of faction and intrigue—thirteen distinct\r\ncommunities under no effective superintending control, (as the United\r\nStates confessedly now are, notwithstanding the bold terms of the\r\nconfederation) will avoid a hatred to each other deep and deadly.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of this enquiry, we shall find the general\r\nprosperity to decline under a system thus unnerved. No sooner is the\r\nmerchant prepared for foreign ports, with the treasures which this\r\nnew world kindly offers to his acceptance, than it is announced to\r\nhim, that they are shut against American shipping, or opened under\r\noppressive regulations. He urges congress to a counter-policy, and\r\nis answered only by a condolence on the general misfortune. He is\r\nimmediately struck with the conviction, that until exclusion shall be\r\nopposed to exclusion, and restriction to restriction, the American flag\r\nwill be disgraced. For who can conceive, that thirteen legislatures,\r\nviewing commerce under different regulations, and fancying themselves\r\ndischarged from every obligation to concede the smallest of their\r\ncommercial advantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought\r\ninto a concert of action and defiance of every prejudice? Nor is this\r\nall: Let the great improvements be recounted, which have enriched and\r\nillustrated Europe: Let it be noted, how few those are, which will be\r\nabsolutely denied to the United States, comprehending within their\r\nboundaries, the choicest blessings of climate, soil and navigable\r\nwaters; then let the most sanguine patriot banish, if he can, the\r\nmortifying belief that all these must sleep, until they shall be roused\r\nby the vigor of a national government.\r\n\r\nI have not exemplified the preceding remarks by minute details; because\r\nthey are evidently fortified by truth, and the consciousness of the\r\nUnited States of America. I shall, therefore, no longer deplore the\r\nunfitness of the confederation to secure our peace; but proceed with\r\na truly unaffected distrust of my own opinions to examine what order\r\nof powers the government of the United States ought to enjoy? How\r\nthey ought to be defended against encroachments? Whether they can be\r\ninterwoven in the confederation, without an alteration of its very\r\nessence, or must be lodged in new hands? Showing, at the same time, the\r\nconvulsions which seem to await us, from a dissolution of the union or\r\npartial confederacies.\r\n\r\nTo mark the kind and degree of authority which ought to be confided\r\nto the government of the United States, is no more than to reverse\r\nthe description which I have already given, of the defects of the\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\nFrom thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will\r\nbe clogged without regular advances of money, and that these will\r\nbe slow indeed, if dependent on supplication alone. For what better\r\nname do requisitions deserve, which may be evaded or opposed without\r\nthe fear of coercion? But although coercion is an indispensable\r\ningredient, it ought not to be directed against a State, as a State;\r\nit being impossible to attempt it except by blockading the trade of\r\nthe delinquent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if these violent\r\nschemes were eligible, in other respects, both of them might, perhaps,\r\nbe defeated by the scantiness of the public chest; would be tardy in\r\ntheir complete effect, as the expense of the land and naval equipments\r\nmust be first reimbursed; and might drive the proscribed State into\r\nthe desperate resolve of inviting foreign alliances. Against each of\r\nthem lie separate unconquerable objections. A blockade is not equally\r\napplicable to all the States, they being differently circumstanced\r\nin commerce and in ports; nay an excommunication from the privilege\r\nof the union would be vain, because every regulation or prohibition\r\nmay be easily eluded under the rights of American citizenship, or of\r\nforeign nations. But how shall we speak of the intrusion of troops?\r\nShall we arm citizens against citizens, and habituate them to shed\r\nkindred blood? Shall we risk the inflicting of wounds which will\r\ngenerate a rancour never to be subdued? Would there be no room to fear,\r\nthat an army accustomed to fight for the establishment of authority,\r\nwould salute an emperor of their own? Let us not bring these things\r\ninto jeopardy. Let us rather substitute the same process by which\r\nindividuals are compelled to contribute to the government of their own\r\nStates. Instead of making requisitions to the legislatures, it would\r\nappear more proper that taxes should be imposed by the federal head,\r\nunder due modifications and guards; that the collectors should demand\r\nfrom the citizens their respective quotas, and be supported as in the\r\ncollection of ordinary taxes.\r\n\r\nIt follows, too, that, as the general government will be responsible to\r\nforeign nations, it ought to be able to annul any offensive measure, or\r\nenforce any public right. Perhaps among the topics on which they may be\r\naggrieved or complain, the commercial intercourse, and the manner in\r\nwhich contracts are discharged, may constitute the principal articles\r\nof clamor.\r\n\r\nIt follows, too, that the general government ought to be the supreme\r\narbiter for adjusting every contention among the States. In all their\r\nconnections, therefore, with each other, and particularly in commerce,\r\nwhich will probably create the greatest discord, it ought to hold the\r\nreins.\r\n\r\nIt follows, too, that the general government ought to protect each\r\nState against domestic as well as external violence.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, it follows, that through the general government alone, can\r\nwe ever assume the rank to which we are entitled by our resources and\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nShould the people of America surrender these powers, they can be\r\nparamount to the constitutions and ordinary acts of legislation, only\r\nby being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture\r\nto believe, that if the confederation had been solemnly questioned in\r\nopposition to our constitution, or even to one of our laws, posterior\r\nto it, it must have given away. For never did it obtain a higher\r\nratification, than a resolution of assembly in the daily form.\r\n\r\nThis will be one security against encroachment. But another not less\r\neffectual is, to exclude the individual States from any agency in the\r\nnational government, as far as it may be safe, and their interposition\r\nmay not be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nBut now, sir, permit me to declare, that in my humbled judgment, the\r\npowers by which alone the blessings of a general government can be\r\naccomplished, cannot be interwoven in the confederation, without a\r\nchange in its very essence, or, in other words, that the confederation\r\nmust be thrown aside. This is almost demonstrable from the inefficacy\r\nof requisitions, and from the necessity of converting them into acts\r\nof authority. My suffrage, as a citizen, is also for additional\r\npowers. But to whom shall we commit those acts of authority, these\r\nadditional powers? To congress? When I formerly lamented the defects\r\nin the jurisdiction of congress, I had no view to indicate any other\r\nopinion, than that the federal head ought not to be so circumscribed.\r\nFor free as I am at all times to profess my reverence for that body,\r\nand the individuals who compose it, I am yet equally free to make\r\nknown my aversion to repose such a trust in a tribunal so constituted.\r\nMy objections are not the visions of theory, but the results of my\r\nown observations in America, and of the experience of others abroad.\r\n1. The legislative and executive are concentred in the same persons.\r\nThis, where real power exists, must eventuate in tyranny. 2. The\r\nrepresentation of the States bears no proportion to their importance.\r\nThis is an unreasonable subjection of the will of the majority to that\r\nof the minority, 3. The mode of election and the liability of being\r\nrecalled, may too often render the delegates rather partizans of their\r\nown States than representatives of the union. 4. Cabal and intrigue\r\nmust consequently gain an ascendancy in a course of years. 5. A single\r\nhouse of legislation will sometimes be precipitate, perhaps passionate.\r\n6. As long as seven States are required for the smallest, and nine\r\nfor the greatest votes, may not foreign influence at some future day\r\ninsinuate itself, so as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To\r\ncrown the whole, it is scarce within the verge of possibility, that so\r\nnumerous an assembly should acquire that secrecy, dispatch, and vigour,\r\nwhich are the test of excellence in the executive department.\r\n\r\nMy inference from these facts and principles, is, that the new powers\r\nmust be deposited in a new body, growing out of a consolidation of\r\nthe union, as far as the circumstances of the State will allow.\r\nPerhaps, however, some may meditate its dissolution, and others partial\r\nconfederacies.\r\n\r\nThe first is an idea awful indeed, and irreconcilable with a very\r\nearly, and hitherto uniform conviction, that without union, we must be\r\nundone. For, before the voice of war was heard, the pulse of the then\r\ncolonies was tried, and found to beat in unison. The unremitted labor\r\nof our enemies was to divide, and the policy of every congress to bind\r\nus together. But in no example was this truth more clearly displayed,\r\nthan in the prudence with which independence was unfolded to the sight,\r\nand in the forbearance to declare it, until America almost unanimously\r\ncalled for it. After we had thus launched into troubles, never before\r\nexplored, and the hour of heavy distress, the remembrance of our social\r\nstrength not only forbade despair, but drew from congress the most\r\nillustrious repetition of their settled purpose to depise all terms,\r\nshort of independence.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, how successful and glorious we have been, while we acted\r\nin fraternal concord. But let us discard the illusion, that by this\r\nsuccess, and this glory, the crest of danger has irrecoverably fallen.\r\nOur governments are yet too youthful to have acquired stability from\r\nhabit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration of the union. Among\r\nthe upright and intelligent, few can read without emotion the future\r\nfate of the States, if severed from each other. Then shall we learn\r\nthe full weight of foreign intrigue. Then shall we hear of partitions\r\nof our country. If a prince, inflamed by the lust of conquest, should\r\nuse one State as the instrument of enslaving others—if every State\r\nis to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to maintain large\r\nmilitary establishments—if all questions are to be decided by an\r\nappeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by\r\nnegociation—in a word, if all the direful misfortunes which haunt the\r\npeace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land, for what have\r\nwe to contend? why have we exhausted our wealth? why have we basely\r\nbetrayed the heroic martyrs of the federal cause?\r\n\r\nBut dreadful as the total dissolution of the union is to my mind, I\r\nentertain no less horror at the thought of partial confederacies. I\r\nhave not the least ground for supposing that an overture of this kind\r\nwould be listened to by a single State, and the presumption is, that\r\nthe politics of the greater part of the States, flow from the warmest\r\nattachment to an union of the whole. If, however, a lesser confederacy\r\ncould be obtained by Virginia, let me conjure my countrymen well to\r\nweigh the probable consequences, before they attempt to form it.\r\n\r\nOn such an event, the strength of the union would be divided in two,\r\nor perhaps three parts. Has it so increased since the war as to be\r\ndivisible—and yet remain sufficient for our happiness?\r\n\r\nThe utmost limit of any partial confederacy, which Virginia could\r\nexpect to form, would comprehend the three southern States, and her\r\nnearest northern neighbour. But they, like ourselves, are diminished in\r\ntheir real force, by the mixture of an unhappy species of population.\r\n\r\nAgain, may I ask, whether the opulence of the United States has been\r\naugmented since the war? This is answered in the negative, by a load of\r\ndebt, and the declension of trade.\r\n\r\nAt all times must a southern confederacy support ships of war, and\r\nsoldiery? As soon would a navy move from the forest, and an army\r\nfrom the earth, as such a confederacy, indebted, impoverished in its\r\ncommerce, and destitute of men, could, for some years at least, provide\r\nan ample defence for itself.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten, that nations which can enforce their rights,\r\nhave large claims against the United States, and that the creditor may\r\ninsist on payment from any of them. Which of them would probably be\r\nthe victim? The most productive and the most exposed. When vexed by\r\nreprisals of war, the southern States will sue for alliance on this\r\ncontinent or beyond sea. If for the former, the necessity of an union\r\nof the whole is decided; if for the latter, America will, I fear,\r\nre-act the scenes of confusion and bloodshed, exhibited among most of\r\nthose nations, which have, too late, repented the folly of relying on\r\nauxiliaries.\r\n\r\nTwo or more confederacies cannot but be competitors for power. The\r\nancient friendship between the citizens of America, being thus cut off,\r\nbitterness and hostility will succeed in its place; in order to prepare\r\nagainst surrounding danger, we shall be compelled to vest some where or\r\nother, power approaching near to military government.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the world have abounded so much with instances of a\r\ndivided people being a prey to foreign influence, that I shall not\r\nrestrain my apprehensions of it, should our union be torn asunder. The\r\nopportunity of insinuating it, will be multiplied in proportion to the\r\nparts into which we may be broken.\r\n\r\nIn short, sir, I am fatigued with summoning up to my imagination the\r\nmiseries which will harass the United States, if torn from each other,\r\nand which will not end until they are superseded by fresh mischiefs\r\nunder the yoke of a tyrant.\r\n\r\nI come, therefore, to the last, and perhaps only refuge in our\r\ndifficulties, a consolidation of the union, as far as circumstances\r\nwill permit. To fulfil this desirable object, the constitution was\r\nframed by the federal convention. A quorum of eleven States, and the\r\nonly member from a twelfth have subscribed it; Mr. Mason, of Virginia,\r\nMr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, and myself having refused to subscribe.\r\n\r\nWhy I refused, will, I hope, be solved to the satisfaction of those\r\nwho know me, by saying, that a sense of duty commanded me thus to\r\nact. It commanded me, sir, for believe me, that no event of my life\r\never occupied more of my reflection. To subscribe, seemed to offer no\r\ninconsiderable gratification, since it would have presented me to the\r\nworld as a fellow laborer with the learned and zealous statesmen of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBut it was far more interesting to my feelings, that I was about to\r\ndiffer from three of my colleagues, one of whom is, to the honor of\r\nthe country which he has saved, embosomed in their affections, and can\r\nreceive no praise from the highest lustre of language; the other two of\r\nwhom have been long enrolled among the wisest and best lovers of the\r\ncommonwealth; and the unshaken and intimate friendship of all of whom\r\nI have ever prized, and still do prize, as among the happiest of all\r\nacquisitions.—I was no stranger to the reigning partiality for the\r\nmembers who composed the convention, and had not the smallest doubt,\r\nthat from this cause, and from the ardor of a reform of government, the\r\nfirst applauses at least would be loud and profuse. I suspected, too,\r\nthat there was something in the human breast which for a time would\r\nbe apt to construe a temperateness in politics, into an enmity to the\r\nunion. Nay, I plainly foresaw, that in the dissensions of parties, a\r\nmiddle line would probably be interpreted into a want of enterprise\r\nand decision.—But these considerations, how seducing soever, were\r\nfeeble opponents to the suggestions of my conscience. I was sent to\r\nexercise my judgment, and to exercise it was my fixed determination;\r\nbeing instructed by even an imperfect acquaintance with mankind, that\r\nself approbation is the only true reward which a political career\r\ncan bestow, and that popularity would have been but another name for\r\nperfidy, if to secure it, I had given up the freedom of thinking for\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a peculiar pleasure to me to have ascertained\r\nbefore I left Virginia, the temper and genius of my fellow citizens,\r\nconsidered relatively to a government, so substantially differing from\r\nthe confederation as that which is now submitted. But this was, for\r\nmany obvious reasons, impossible; and I was thereby deprived of what I\r\nthought the necessary guides.\r\n\r\nI saw, however, that the confederation was tottering from its own\r\nweakness, and that the sitting of a convention was a signal of its\r\ntotal insufficiency. I was therefore ready to assent to a scheme of\r\ngovernment, which was proposed, and which went beyond the limits of the\r\nconfederation, believing, that without being too extensive it would\r\nhave preserved our tranquility, until that temper and that genius\r\nshould be collected.\r\n\r\nBut when the plan which is now before the general assembly, was on its\r\npassage through the convention, I moved, that the State conventions\r\nshould be at liberty to amend, and that a second general convention\r\nshould beholden, to discuss the amendments, which should be suggested\r\nby them. This motion was in some measure justified by the manner in\r\nwhich the confederation was forwarded originally, by congress to the\r\nState legislatures, in many of which amendments were proposed, and\r\nthose amendments were afterwards examined in congress. Such a motion\r\nwas doubly expedient here, as the delegation of so much power was\r\nsought for. But it was negatived. I then expressed my unwillingness to\r\nsign. My reasons were the following:\r\n\r\n1. It is said in the resolutions which accompany the constitution, that\r\nit is to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State\r\nby the people thereof, for their assent and ratification. The meaning\r\nof these terms is allowed universally to be, that the convention must\r\neither adopt the constitution in the whole, or reject it in the whole,\r\nand is positively forbidden to amend. If therefore, I had signed,\r\nI should have felt myself bound to be silent as to amendments, and\r\nto endeavor to support the constitution without the correction of a\r\nletter. With this consequence before my eyes, and with a determination\r\nto attempt an amendment, I was taught by a regard for consistency not\r\nto sign.\r\n\r\n2. My opinion always was, and still is, that every citizen of America,\r\nlet the crisis be what it may, ought to have a full opportunity to\r\npropose, through his representatives, any amendment which in his\r\napprehension, tends to the public welfare. By signing, I should have\r\ncontradicted this sentiment.\r\n\r\n3. A constitution ought to have the hearts of the people on its side.\r\nBut if at a future day it should be burdensome after having been\r\nadopted in the whole, and they should insinuate that it was in some\r\nmeasure forced upon them, by being confined to the single alternative\r\nof taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impressions, and with my\r\nopinions, I should not be able to justify myself had I signed.\r\n\r\n4. I was always satisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great\r\nsubject would be placed in new lights and attitudes by the criticism\r\nof the world, and that no man can assure himself how a constitution\r\nwill work for a course of years, until at least he shall have heard the\r\nobservations of the people at large. I also fear more from inaccuracies\r\nin a constitution, than from gross errors in any other composition;\r\nbecause our dearest interests are to be regulated by it; and power,\r\nif loosely given, especially where it will be interpreted with great\r\nlatitude, may bring sorrow in its execution. Had I signed with these\r\nideas, I should have virtually shut my ears against the information\r\nwhich I ardently desired.\r\n\r\n5. I was afraid that if the constitution was to be submitted to\r\nthe people, to be wholly adopted or wholly rejected by them, they\r\nwould not only reject it, but bid a lasting farewell to the union.\r\nThis formidable event I wished to avert, by keeping myself free to\r\npropose amendments, and thus, if possible, to remove the obstacles\r\nto an effectual government. But it will be asked, whether all these\r\narguments, were not be well weighed in convention. They were, sir,\r\nwith great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the respectability of\r\nthose, with whom I was associated, I almost lost confidence in these\r\nprinciples. On other occasions, I should cheerfully have yielded to a\r\nmajority; on this the fate of thousands yet unborn, enjoined me not to\r\nyield until I was convinced.\r\n\r\nAgain, may I be asked, why the mode pointed out in the constitution\r\nfor its amendment, may not be a sufficient security against its\r\nimperfections, without now arresting it in its progress? My answers\r\nare—1. That it is better to amend, while we have the constitution in\r\nour power, while the passions of designing men are not yet enlisted,\r\nand while a bare majority of the States may amend than to wait for\r\nthe uncertain assent of three fourths of the States. 2. That a bad\r\nfeature in government, becomes more and more fixed every day. 3. That\r\nfrequent changes of a constitution, even if practicable, ought not to\r\nbe wished, but avoided as much as possible. And 4. That in the present\r\ncase, it may be questionable, whether, after the particular advantages\r\nof its operation shall be discerned, three fourths of the States can be\r\ninduced to amend.\r\n\r\nI confess, that it is no easy task, to devise a scheme which shall\r\nbe suitable to the views of all. Many expedients have occurred to\r\nme, but none of them appear less exceptionable than this; that if\r\nour convention should choose to amend, another federal convention be\r\nrecommended: that in that federal convention the amendments proposed\r\nby this or any other State be discussed; and if incorporated in the\r\nconstitution or rejected, or if a proper number of the other States\r\nshould be unwilling to accede to a second convention, the constitution\r\nbe again laid before the same State conventions, which shall again\r\nassemble on the summons of the executives, and it shall be either\r\nwholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of\r\namendment. I count such a delay as nothing in comparison with so grand\r\nan object; especially too as the privilege of amending must terminate\r\nafter the use of it once.\r\n\r\nI should now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it\r\nnot incumbent on me, from having contended for amendments, to set forth\r\nthe particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake\r\nthis with reluctance: because it is remote from my intentions to\r\ncatch the prejudices or prepossessions of any man. But as I mean only\r\nto manifest that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to\r\nexplain every objection at full length would be an immense labour,\r\nI shall content myself with enumerating certain heads, in which the\r\nconstitution is most repugnant to my wishes.\r\n\r\nThe two first points are the equality of suffrage in the senate, and\r\nthe submission of commerce to a mere majority in the legislature, with\r\nno other check than the revision of the president. I conjecture that\r\nneither of these things can be corrected; and particularly the former,\r\nwithout which we must have risen perhaps in disorder.\r\n\r\nBut I am sanguine in hoping that in every other justly obnoxious cause,\r\nVirginia will be seconded by a majority of the States. I hope that she\r\nwill be seconded. 1. In causing all ambiguities of expression to be\r\nprecisely explained. 2. In rendering the president ineligible after a\r\ngiven number of years. 3. In taking from him the power of nominating\r\nto the judiciary offices, or of filling up vacancies which may there\r\nhappen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which\r\nshall expire at the end of their next sessions. 4. In taking from him\r\nthe power of pardoning for treason at least before conviction. 5. In\r\ndrawing a line between the powers of congress and individual States;\r\nand in defining the former, so as to leave no clashing of jurisdictions\r\nnor dangerous disputes; and to prevent the one from being swallowed\r\nup by the other, under cover of general words, and implication. 6. In\r\nabridging the power of the senate to make treaties supreme laws of\r\nthe land. 7. In incapacitating the congress to determine their own\r\nsalaries. And 8. In limiting and defining the judicial power.\r\n\r\nThe proper remedy must be consigned to the wisdom of the convention;\r\nand the final step which Virginia shall pursue, if her overtures shall\r\nbe discarded, must also rest with them.\r\n\r\nYou will excuse me, sir, for having been thus tedious. My feelings\r\nand duty demanded this exposition; for through no other channel could\r\nI rescue my omission to sign from misrepresentation, and no more\r\neffectual way could I exhibit to the general assembly an unreserved\r\nhistory of my conduct.\r\n\r\nI have the honor, sir, to be with great respect, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nEDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation / leading to a fair examination / of the / system of\r\ngovernment, / proposed by the late / Convention; / and to several\r\nessential and neces-/ sary alterations in it. / In a number of /\r\nLetters / from the / Federal Farmer to the Republican.

F.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\n  October 8th, 1787.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy letters to you last winter, on the subject of a well balanced\r\nnational government for the United States, were the result of a\r\nfree enquiry; when I passed from that subject to enquiries relative\r\nto our commerce, revenues, past administration, &c. I anticipated\r\nthe anxieties I feel, on carefully examining the plan of government\r\nproposed by the convention. It appears to be a plan retaining some\r\nfederal features; but to be the first important step, and to aim\r\nstrongly at one consolidated government of the United States. It\r\nleaves the powers of government, and the representation of the people,\r\nso unnaturally divided between the general and state governments,\r\nthat the operations of our system must be very uncertain. My uniform\r\nfederal attachments, and the interest I have in the protection of\r\nproperty, and a steady execution of the laws, will convince you,\r\nthat, if I am under any bias at all, it is in favor of any general\r\nsystem which shall promise those advantages. The instability of our\r\nlaws increases my wishes for firm and steady government; but then, I\r\ncan consent to no government, which, in my opinion, is not calculated\r\nequally to preserve the rights of all orders of men in the community.\r\nMy object has been to join with those who have endeavoured to supply\r\nthe defects in the forms of our governments by a steady and proper\r\nadministration of them. Though I have long apprehended that fraudalentd\r\ndebtors, and embarrassed men, on the one hand, and men, on the other,\r\nunfriendly to republican equality, would produce an uneasiness among\r\nthe people, and prepare the way, not for cool and deliberate reforms in\r\nthe governments, but for changes calculated to promote the interests\r\nof particular orders of men. Acquit me, sir, of any agency in the\r\nformation of the new system; I shall be satisfied with seeing, if it\r\nshall be adopted with a prudent administration. Indeed I am so much\r\nconvinced of the truth of Pope’s maxim, that “That which is best [4]\r\nadministered is best,” that I am much inclined to subscribe to it from\r\nexperience. I am not disposed to unreasonably contend about forms. I\r\nknow our situation is critical, and it behooves us to make the best of\r\nit. A federal government of some sort is necessary. We have suffered\r\nthe present to languish; and whether the confederation was capable\r\nor not originally of answering any valuable purposes, it is now but\r\nof little importance. I will pass by the men, and states, who have\r\nbeen particularly instrumental in preparing the way for a change, and\r\nperhaps, for governments not very favourable to the people at large.\r\nA constitution is now presented which we may reject, or which we may\r\naccept with or without amendments, and to which point we ought to\r\ndirect our exertions is the question. To determine this question with\r\npropriety; we must attentively examine the system itself, and the\r\nprobable consequences of either step. This I shall endeavour to do, so\r\nfar as I am able, with candor and fairness; and leave you to decide\r\nupon the propriety of my opinions, the weight of my reasons, and how\r\nfar my conclusions are well drawn. Whatever may be the conduct of\r\nothers, on the present occasion, I do not mean hastily and positively\r\nto decide on the merits of the constitution proposed. I shall be open\r\nto conviction and always disposed to adopt that which, all things\r\nconsidered, shall appear to me to be most for the happiness of the\r\ncommunity. It must be granted, that if men hastily and blindly adopt\r\na system of government, they will as hastily and as blindly be led\r\nto alter or abolish it; and changes must ensue, one after another,\r\ntill the peaceable and better part of the community will grow weary\r\nwith changes, tumults and disorders, and be disposed to accept any\r\ngovernment however despotic, that shall promise stability and firmness.\r\n\r\nThe first principal question that occurs, is, Whether, considering\r\nour situation, we ought to precipitate the adoption of the proposed\r\nconstitution? If we remain cool and temperate, we are in no immediate\r\ndanger of any commotions; we are in a state of perfect peace, and in\r\nno danger of invasions; the state governments are in the full exercise\r\nof their powers; and our governments answer all present exigencies,\r\nexcept the regulation of trade, securing credit, in some cases, and\r\nproviding for the interest, in some instances, of the public debts;\r\nand whether we adopt a change three or nine months hence, can make\r\nbut little odds with the private circumstances of individuals; their\r\nhappiness and prosperity, after all, depend principally upon their own\r\nexertions. We are hardly recovered from a long and distressing war:\r\nThe farmers, fishermen, &c. have not fully repaired the waste made by\r\nit. Industry [5] and frugality are again assuming their proper station.\r\nPrivate debts are lessened, and public debts incurred by the war have\r\nbeen, by various ways, diminished; and the public lands have now become\r\na productive source for diminishing them much more. I know uneasy men,\r\nwho with very much to precipitate, do not admit all these facts; but\r\nthey are facts well known to all men who are thoroughly informed in\r\nthe affairs of this country. It must, however, be admitted, that our\r\nfederal system is defective, and that some of the state governments\r\nare not well administered; but, then, we impute to the defects in our\r\ngovernments many evils and embarrassments which are most clearly the\r\nresult of the late war. We must allow men to conduct on the present\r\noccasion, as on all similar ones. They will urge a thousand pretences\r\nto answer their purposes on both sides. When we want a man to change\r\nhis condition, we describe it as wretched, miserable, and despised;\r\nand draw a pleasing picture of that which we would have him assume.\r\nAnd when we wish the contrary, we reverse our descriptions. Whenever\r\na clamor is raised, and idle men get to work, it is highly necessary\r\nto examine facts carefully, and without unreasonably suspecting men of\r\nfalsehood, to examine, and enquire attentively, under what impressions\r\nthey act. It is too often the case in political concerns that men state\r\nfacts not as they are, but as they wish them to be; and almost every\r\nman, by calling to mind past scenes, will find this to be true.\r\n\r\nNothing but the passions of ambitious, impatient, or disorderly men,\r\nI conceive, will plunge us into commotions, if time should be taken\r\nfully to examine and consider the system proposed. Men who feel easy in\r\ntheir circumstances, and such as are not sanguine in their expectations\r\nrelative to the consequences of the proposed change, will remain quiet\r\nunder the existing governments. Many commercial and monied men, who are\r\nuneasy, not without just cause, ought to be respected; and by no means,\r\nunreasonably disappointed in their expectations and hopes; but as to\r\nthose who expect employments under the new constitution; as to those\r\nweak and ardent men who always expect to be gainers by revolutions, and\r\nwhose lot it generally is to get out of one difficulty into another,\r\nthey are very little to be regarded; and as to those who designedly\r\navail themselves of this weakness and ardor, they are to be despised.\r\nIt is natural for men, who wish to hasten the adoption of a measure, to\r\ntell us, now is the crisis—now is the critical moment which must be\r\nseized or all will be lost; and to shut the door against free enquiry,\r\nwhenever conscious the thing presented has defects in it, which time\r\nand investigation will probably discover. This has been the custom of\r\ntyrants, [6] and their dependants in all ages. If it is true, what\r\nhas been so often said, that the people of this country cannot change\r\ntheir condition for the worse, I presume it still behoves them to\r\nendeavour deliberately to change it for the better. The fickle and\r\nardent, in any community are the proper tools for establishing despotic\r\ngovernment. But it is deliberate and thinking men, who must establish\r\nand secure governments on free principles. Before they decide on the\r\nplan proposed, they will enquire whether it will probably be a blessing\r\nor a curse to this people.\r\n\r\nThe present moment discovers a new face in our affairs. Our object\r\nhas been all along, to reform our federal system, and to strengthen\r\nour governments—to establish peace, order and justice in the\r\ncommunity—but a new object now presents. The plan of government now\r\nproposed is evidently calculated totally to change, in time, our\r\ncondition as a people. Instead of being thirteen republics, under\r\na federal head, it is clearly designed to make us one consolidated\r\ngovernment. Of this, I think, I shall fully convince you, in my\r\nfollowing letters on this subject. This consolidation of the states\r\nhas been the object of several men in this country for some time past.\r\nWhether such a change can ever be effected, in any manner; whether it\r\ncan be effected without convulsions and civil wars; whether such a\r\nchange will not totally destroy the liberties of this country—time\r\nonly can determine.\r\n\r\nTo have a just idea of the government before us, and to shew that\r\na consolidated one is the object in view, it is necessary not only\r\nto examine the plan, but also its history, and the politics of its\r\nparticular friends.\r\n\r\nThe confederation was formed when great confidence was placed in the\r\nvoluntary exertions of individuals, and of the respective states;\r\nand the framers of it, to guard against usurpation, so limited, and\r\nchecked the powers, that, in many respects, they are inadequate to the\r\nexigencies of the union. We find, therefore, members of congress urging\r\nalterations in the federal system almost as soon as it was adopted. It\r\nwas early proposed to vest congress with powers to levy an impost, to\r\nregulate trade, &c. but such was known to be the caution of the states\r\nin parting with power, that the vestment even of these, was proposed to\r\nbe under several checks and limitations. During the war, the general\r\nconfusion, and the introduction, of paper money, infused in the minds\r\nof people vague ideas respecting government and credit. We expected too\r\nmuch from the return of peace, and of course we have been disappointed.\r\nOur governments have been new and unsettled; and several legislatures,\r\nby making tender, suspension, and paper money laws, [7] have given just\r\ncause of uneasiness to creditors. By these and other causes, several\r\norders of men in the community have been prepared, by degrees, for a\r\nchange of government; and this very abuse of power in the legislatures,\r\nwhich in some cases has been charged upon the democratic part of the\r\ncommunity, has furnished aristocratical men with those very weapons,\r\nand those very means, with which, in great measure, they are rapidly\r\neffecting their favourite object. And should an oppressive government\r\nbe the consequence of the proposed change, prosperity may reproach not\r\nonly a few overbearing, unprincipled men, but those parties in the\r\nstates which have misused their powers.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of several legislatures, touching paper money, and tender\r\nlaws, has prepared many honest men for changes in government, which\r\notherwise they would not have thought of—when by the evils, on the\r\none hand, and by the secret instigations of artful men, on the other,\r\nthe minds of men were become sufficiently uneasy, a bold step was\r\ntaken, which is usually followed by a revolution, or a civil war. A\r\ngeneral convention for mere commercial purposes was moved for—the\r\nauthors of this measure saw that the people’s attention was turned\r\nsolely to the amendment of the federal system; and that, had the idea\r\nof a total change been started, probably no state would have appointed\r\nmembers to the convention. The idea of destroying ultimately, the state\r\ngovernment, and forming one consolidated system, could not have been\r\nadmitted—a convention, therefore, merely for vesting in congress power\r\nto regulate trade was proposed. This was pleasing to the commercial\r\ntowns; and the landed people had little or no concern about it.\r\nSeptember, 1786, a few men from the middle states met at Annapolis,\r\nand hastily proposed a convention to be held in May, 1787, for the\r\npurpose, generally, of amending the confederation—this was done before\r\nthe delegates of Massachusetts, and of the other states arrived—still\r\nnot a word was said about destroying the old constitution, and making\r\na new one.—The states still unsuspecting, and not aware that they\r\nwere passing the Rubicon, appointed members to the new convention,\r\nfor the sole and express purpose of revising and amending the\r\nconfederation—and, probably, not one man in ten thousand in the United\r\nStates, till within these ten or twelve days, had an idea that the old\r\nship was to be destroyed, and he put to the alternative of embarking\r\nin the new ship presented, or of being left in danger of sinking.—The\r\nStates, I believe, universally supposed the convention would report\r\nalterations in the confederation, which would pass an examination in\r\ncongress, and after being agreed to there, would be confirmed by all\r\nthe legislatures, [8] or be rejected. Virginia made a very respectable\r\nappointment, and placed at the head of it the first man in America.\r\nIn this appointment there was a mixture of political characters;\r\nbut Pennsylvania appointed principally those men who are esteemed\r\naristocratical. Here the favourite moment for changing the government\r\nwas evidently discerned by a few men, who seized it with address. Ten\r\nother states appointed, and tho’ they chose men principally connected\r\nwith commerce and the judicial department yet they appointed many good\r\nrepublican characters—had they all attended we should now see, I am\r\npersuaded, a better system presented. The non-attendance of eight or\r\nnine men, who were appointed members of the convention, I shall ever\r\nconsider as a very unfortunate event to the United States.——Had they\r\nattended, I am pretty clear that the result of the convention would not\r\nhave had that strong tendency to aristocracy now discernable in every\r\npart of the plan. There would not have been so great an accumulation of\r\npowers, especially as to the internal police of this country in a few\r\nhands as the constitution reported proposes to vest in them—the young\r\nvisionary men, and the consolidating aristocracy, would have been more\r\nrestrained than they have been. Eleven states met in the convention,\r\nand after four months close attention presented the new constitution,\r\nto be adopted or rejected by the people. The uneasy and fickle part of\r\nthe community may be prepared to receive any form of government; but I\r\npresume the enlightened and substantial part will give any constitution\r\npresented for their adoption a candid and thorough examination; and\r\nsilence those designing or empty men, who weakly and rashly attempt to\r\nprecipitate the adoption of a system of so much importance—We shall\r\nview the convention with proper respect——and, at the same time, that\r\nwe reflect there were men of abilities and integrity in it, we must\r\nrecollect how disproportionately the democratic and aristocratic parts\r\nof the community were represented——Perhaps the judicious friends and\r\nopposers of the new constitution will agree, that it is best to let it\r\nrely solely on its own merits, or be condemned for its own defects.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I shall premise, that the plan proposed is a plan\r\nof accommodation—and that it is in this way only, and by giving up a\r\npart of our opinions, that we can ever expect to obtain a government\r\nfounded in freedom and compact. This circumstance candid men will\r\nalways keep in view, in the discussion of this subject.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed appears to be partly federal, but principally\r\nhowever, calculated ultimately to make the states one consolidated\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe first interesting question, therefore suggested, is, how [9] far\r\nthe states can be consolidated into one entire government on free\r\nprinciples. In considering this question extensive objects are to be\r\ntaken into view, and important changes in the forms of government to be\r\ncarefully attended to in all their consequences. The happiness of the\r\npeople at large must be the great object with every honest statesman,\r\nand he will direct every movement to this point. If we are so situated\r\nas a people, as not to be able to enjoy equal happiness and advantages\r\nunder one government, the consolidation of the states cannot be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nThere are three different forms of free government under which the\r\nUnited States may exist as one nation; and now is, perhaps, the time\r\nto determine to which we will direct our views. 1. Distinct republics\r\nconnected under a federal head. In this case the respective state\r\ngovernments must be the principal guardians of the peoples rights,\r\nand exclusively regulate their internal police; in them must rest the\r\nbalance of government. The congress of the states, or federal head,\r\nmust consist of delegates amenable to, and removable by the respective\r\nstates: This congress must have general directing powers; powers to\r\nrequire men and monies of the states; to make treaties; peace and war;\r\nto direct the operations of armies, &c. Under this federal modification\r\nof government, the powers of congress would be rather advisary or\r\nrecommendatory than coercive. 2. We may do away the federal state\r\ngovernments, and form or consolidate all the states into one entire\r\ngovernment, with one executive, one judiciary, and one legislature,\r\nconsisting of senators and representatives collected from all parts\r\nof the union: In this case there would be a compleat consolidation of\r\nthe states. 3. We may consolidate the states as to certain national\r\nobjects, and leave them severally distinct independent republics, as\r\nto internal police generally. Let the general government consist of\r\nan executive, a judiciary, and balanced legislature, and its powers\r\nextend exclusively to all foreign concerns, causes arising on the\r\nseas to commerce, imports, armies, navies, Indian affairs, peace and\r\nwar, and to a few internal concerns of the community; to the coin,\r\npost-offices, weights and measures, a general plan for the militia, to\r\nnaturalization, _and, perhaps to bankruptcies_, leaving the internal\r\npolice of the community, in other respects, exclusively to the state\r\ngovernments; as the administration of justice in all causes arising\r\ninternally, the laying and collecting of internal taxes, and the\r\nforming of the militia according to a general plan prescribed. In this\r\ncase there would be a compleat consolidation, _quoad_ certain objects\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nTouching the first, or federal plan, I do not think much can be said\r\nin its favor: The sovereignity of the nation, without [10] coercive\r\nand efficient powers to collect the strength of it, cannot always be\r\ndepended on to answer the purposes of government; and in a congress\r\nof representatives of foreign states, there must necessarily be an\r\nunreasonable mixture of powers in the same hands.\r\n\r\nAs to the second, or compleat consolidating plan, it deserves to\r\nbe carefully considered at this time by every American: If it be\r\nimpracticable, it is a fatal error to model our governments, directing\r\nour views ultimately to it.\r\n\r\nThe third plan, or partial consolidation, is, in my opinion, the only\r\none that can secure the freedom and happiness of this people. I once\r\nhad some general ideas that the second plan was practicable, but from\r\nlong attention, and the proceedings of the convention, I am fully\r\nsatisfied, that this third plan is the only one we can with safety and\r\npropriety proceed upon. Making this the standard to point out, with\r\ncandor and fairness, the parts of the new constitution which appear\r\nto be improper, is my object. The convention appears to have proposed\r\nthe partial consolidation evidently with a view to collect all powers\r\nultimately, in the United States into one entire government; and from\r\nits views in this respect, and from the tenacity of the small states\r\nto have an equal vote in the senate, probably originated the greatest\r\ndefects in the proposed plan.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the opinions of many great authors, that a free elective\r\ngovernment cannot be extended over large territories, a few reflections\r\nmust evince, that one government and general legislation alone never\r\ncan extend equal benefits to all parts of the United States: Different\r\nlaws, customs, and opinions exist in the different states, which by a\r\nuniform system of laws would be unreasonably invaded. The United States\r\ncontain about a million of square miles, and in half a century will,\r\nprobably, contain ten millions of people; and from the center to the\r\nextremes is about 800 miles.\r\n\r\nBefore we do away the state governments or adopt measures that\r\nwill tend to abolish them, and to consolidate the states into one\r\nentire government several principles should be considered and facts\r\nascertained:——These, and my examination into the essential parts of\r\nthe proposed plan, I shall pursue in my next.\r\n\r\n  Your’s, &c.\r\n\r\n  THE FEDERAL FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] LETTER II.\r\n\r\n  October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of a free and good government are a full and\r\nequal representation of the people in the legislature, and the jury\r\ntrial of the vicinage in the administration of justice—a full and\r\nequal representation, is that which possesses the same interests,\r\nfeelings, opinions, and views the people themselves would were\r\nthey all assembled—a fair representation, therefore, should be so\r\nregulated, that every order of men in the community, according to the\r\ncommon course of elections, can have a share in it—in order to allow\r\nprofessional men, merchants, traders, farmers, mechanics, &c. to bring\r\na just proportion of their best informed men respectively into the\r\nlegislature, the representation must be considerably numerous—We\r\nhave about 200 state senators in the United States, and a less number\r\nthan that of federal representatives cannot, clearly, be a full\r\nrepresentation of this people, in the affairs of internal taxation\r\nand police, were there but one legislature for the whole union. The\r\nrepresentation cannot be equal, or the situation of the people proper\r\nfor one government only—if the extreme parts of the society cannot be\r\nrepresented as fully as the central—It is apparently impracticable\r\nthat this should be the case in this extensive country——it would be\r\nimpossible to collect a representation of the parts of the country\r\nfive, six, and seven hundred miles from the seat of government.\r\n\r\nUnder one general government alone, there could be but one judiciary,\r\none supreme and a proper number of inferior courts. I think it\r\nwould be totally impracticable in this case to preserve a due\r\nadministration of justice, and the real benefits of the jury trial\r\nof the vicinage——there are now supreme courts in each state in the\r\nunion, and a great number of county and other courts subordinate to\r\neach supreme court——most of these supreme and inferior courts are\r\nitinerant, and hold their sessions in different parts every year of\r\ntheir respective states, counties and districts—with all these moving\r\ncourts, our citizens, from the vast extent of the country, must travel\r\nvery considerable distances from home to find the place where justice\r\nis administered. I am not for bringing justice so near to individuals\r\nas to afford them any temptation to engage in law suits; though I\r\nthink it one of the greatest benefits in a good government, that each\r\ncitizen should find a court of justice within a reasonable distance,\r\nperhaps, within a day’s travel of his [12] home; so that, without\r\ngreat inconveniences and enormous expense, he may have the advantages\r\nof his witnesses and jury—it would be impracticable to derive these\r\nadvantages from one judiciary——the one supreme court at most could\r\nonly set in the centre of the union, and move once a year into the\r\ncentre of the eastern and southern extremes of it—and, in this case,\r\neach citizen, on an average, would travel 150 or 200 miles to find\r\nthis court——that, however, inferior courts might be properly placed\r\nin the different counties, and districts of the union, the appellate\r\njurisdiction would be intolerable and expensive.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to consolidate the states, and preserve the\r\nfeatures of a free government, still it is evident that the middle\r\nstates, the parts of the union, about the seat of government, would\r\nenjoy great advantages, while the remote states would experience the\r\nmany inconveniences of remote provinces. Wealth, offices, and the\r\nbenefits of government would collect in the centre: and the extreme\r\nstates; and their principal towns, become much less important.\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations which tend to prove that the idea\r\nof one consolidated whole, on free principles, is ill-founded—the\r\nlaws of a free government rest on the confidence of the people, and\r\noperate gently—and never can extend the influence very far—if they\r\nare executed on free principles, about the centre, where the benefits\r\nof the government induce the people to support it voluntarily; yet\r\nthey must be executed on the principles of fear and force in the\r\nextremes.—This has been the case with every extensive republic of\r\nwhich we have any accurate account.\r\n\r\nThere are certain unalienable and fundamental rights, which in forming\r\nthe social compact, ought to be explicitly ascertained and fixed—a\r\nfree and enlightened people, in forming this compact, will not resign\r\nall their rights to those who govern, and they will fix limits to\r\ntheir legislators and rulers, which will soon be plainly seen by those\r\nwho are governed, as well as by those who govern: and the latter will\r\nknow they cannot be passed unperceived by the former, and without\r\ngiving a general alarm.—These rights should be made the basis of\r\nevery constitution; and if a people be so situated, or have such\r\ndifferent opinions that they cannot agree in ascertaining and fixing\r\nthem, it is a very strong argument against their attempting to form\r\none entire society, to live under one system of laws only.—I confess,\r\nI never thought the people of these states differed essentially in\r\nthese respects; they having derived all these rights from one common\r\nsource, the British systems; and having in the formation of their state\r\nconstitutions, discovered that their ideas [13] relative to these\r\nrights are very similar. However, it is now said that the states\r\ndiffer so essentially in these respects, and even in the important\r\narticle of the trial by jury, that when assembled in convention, they\r\ncan agree to no words by which to establish that trial, or by which\r\nto ascertain and establish many other of these rights, as fundamental\r\narticles in the social compact. If so, we proceed to consolidate the\r\nstates on no solid basis whatever.\r\n\r\nBut I do not pay much regard to the reasons given for not bottoming\r\nthe new constitution on a better bill of rights. I still believe a\r\ncomplete federal bill of rights to be very practicable. Nevertheless I\r\nacknowledge the proceedings of the convention furnish my mind with many\r\nnew and strong reasons, against a complete consolidation of the states.\r\nThey tend to convince me, that it cannot be carried with propriety\r\nvery far—that the convention have gone much farther in one respect\r\nthan they found it practicable to go in another; that is, they propose\r\nto lodge in the general government very extensive powers—_powers_\r\nnearly, if not altogether, complete and unlimited, over the purse and\r\nthe sword. But, in its organization, they furnish the strongest proof\r\nthat the proper limbs, or parts of a government, to support and execute\r\nthose powers on proper principles (or in which they can be safely\r\nlodged) cannot be formed. These powers must be lodged somewhere in\r\nevery society; but then they should be lodged where the strength and\r\nguardians of the people are collected. They can be wielded, or safely\r\nused, in a free country only by an able executive and judiciary, a\r\nrespectable senate, and a secure, full, and equal representation of the\r\npeople. I think the principles I have premised or brought into view,\r\nare well founded—I think they will not be denied by any fair reasoner.\r\nIt is in connection with these, and other solid principles, we are to\r\nexamine the constitution. It is not a few democratic phrases, or a\r\nfew well formed features, that will prove its merits; or a few small\r\nomissions that will produce its rejection among men of sense; they will\r\nenquire what are the essential powers in a community, and what are\r\nnominal ones; where and how the essential powers shall be lodged to\r\nsecure government, and to secure true liberty.\r\n\r\nIn examining the proposed constitution carefully, we must clearly\r\nperceive an unnatural separation of these powers from the substantial\r\nrepresentation of the people. The state government will exist, with all\r\ntheir governors, senators, representatives, officers and expences; in\r\nthese will be nineteen twentieths of the representatives of the people;\r\nthey will have a near connection, and their members an immediate\r\nintercourse with the people; and the probability is, that the state\r\ngovernments will possess the [14] confidence of the people, and be\r\nconsidered generally as their immediate guardians.\r\n\r\nThe general government will consist of a new species of executive,\r\na small senate, and a very small house of representatives. As many\r\ncitizens will be more than three hundred miles from the seat of this\r\ngovernment as will be nearer to it, its judges and officers cannot be\r\nvery numerous, without making our governments very expensive. Thus will\r\nstand the state and the general governments, should the constitution\r\nbe adopted without any alterations in their organization; but as to\r\npowers, the general government will possess all essential ones, at\r\nleast on paper, and those of the states a mere shadow of power. And\r\ntherefore, unless the people shall make some great exertions to restore\r\nto the state governments their powers in matters of internal police; as\r\nthe powers to lay and collect, exclusively, internal taxes, to govern\r\nthe militia, and to hold the decisions of their own judicial courts\r\nupon their own laws final, the balance cannot possibly continue long;\r\nbut the state governments must be annihilated, or continue to exist for\r\nno purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is however to be observed, that many of the essential powers\r\ngiven the national government are exclusively given; and the general\r\ngovernment may have prudence enough to forbear the exercise of those\r\nwhich may still be exercised by the respective states. But this cannot\r\njustify the impropriety of giving powers, the exercise of which\r\nprudent men will not attempt, and imprudent men will, or probably can,\r\nexercise only in a manner destructive of free government. The general\r\ngovernment, organized as it is, may be adequate to many valuable\r\nobjects, and be able to carry its laws into execution on proper\r\nprinciples in several cases; but I think its warmest friends will not\r\ncontend, that it can carry all the powers proposed to be lodged in it\r\ninto effect, without calling to its aid a military force, which must\r\nvery soon destroy all elective governments in the country, produce\r\nanarchy, or establish despotism. Though we cannot have now a complete\r\nidea of what will be the operations of the proposed system, we may,\r\nallowing things to have their common course, have a very tolerable\r\none. The powers lodged in the general government, if exercised by it,\r\nmust intimately effect the internal police of the states, as well\r\nas external concerns; and there is no reason to expect the numerous\r\nstate governments, and their connections, will be very friendly to the\r\nexecution of federal laws in those internal affairs, which hitherto\r\nhave been under their own immediate management. There is more reason\r\nto believe, that the general government, far removed from the people,\r\nand none of its members elected oftener than once in two years, will\r\nbe forgot [15] or neglected, and its laws in many cases disregarded,\r\nunless a multitude of officers and military force be continually kept\r\nin view, and employed to enforce the execution of the laws, and to\r\nmake the government feared and respected. No position can be truer\r\nthan this. That in this country either neglected laws, or a military\r\nexecution of them, must lead to a revolution, and to the destruction\r\nof freedom. Neglected laws must first lead to anarchy and confusion;\r\nand a military execution of laws is only a shorter way to the same\r\npoint—despotic government.\r\n\r\n  Your’s, &c.\r\n\r\n  THE FEDERAL FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\n  October 10th, 1787.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe great object of a free people must be so to form their government\r\nand laws, and so to administer them, as to create a confidence in, and\r\nrespect for the laws; and thereby induce the sensible and virtuous part\r\nof the community to declare in favor of the laws, and to support them\r\nwithout an expensive military force. I wish, though I confess I have\r\nnot much hope, that this may be the case with the laws of congress\r\nunder the new constitution. I am fully convinced that we must organize\r\nthe national government on different principals, and make the parts\r\nof it more efficient, and secure in it more effectually the different\r\ninterests in the community; or else leave in the state governments some\r\npowers proposed to be lodged in it—at least till such an organization\r\nshall be found to be practicable. Not sanguine in my expectations\r\nof a good federal administration, and satisfied, as I am, of the\r\nimpracticability of consolidating the states, and at the same time of\r\npreserving the rights of the people at large, I believe we ought still\r\nto leave some of those powers in the state governments, in which the\r\npeople, in fact, will still be represented—to define some other powers\r\nproposed to be vested in the general government, more carefully, and to\r\nestablish a few principles to secure a proper exercise of the powers\r\ngiven it. It is not my object to multiply objections, or to contend\r\nabout inconsiderable powers or amendments. I wish the system adopted\r\nwith a few alterations; but those, in my mind, are essential ones;\r\nif adopted without, [16] every good citizen will acquiesce, though I\r\nshall consider the duration of our governments, and the liberties of\r\nthis people, very much dependant on the administration of the general\r\ngovernment. A wise and honest administration, may make the people\r\nhappy under any government; but necessity only can justify even our\r\nleaving open avenues to the abuse of power, by wicked, unthinking, or\r\nambitious men. I will examine, first, the organization of the proposed\r\ngovernment, in order to judge; 2d, with propriety, what powers are\r\nimproperly, at least prematurely lodged in it. I shall examine, 3d, the\r\nundefined powers; and 4th, those powers, the exercise of which is not\r\nsecured on safe and proper ground.\r\n\r\nFirst. As to the organization——the house of representatives, the\r\ndemocrative branch, as it is called, is to consist of 65 members:\r\nthat is, about one representative for fifty thousand inhabitants, to\r\nbe chosen biennially——the federal legislature may increase this\r\nnumber to one for each thirty thousand inhabitants, abating fractional\r\nnumbers in each state.——Thirty-three representatives will make a\r\nquorum for doing business, and a majority of those present determine\r\nthe sense of the house.——I have no idea that the interests, feelings,\r\nand opinions of three or four millions of people, especially touching\r\ninternal taxation, can be collected in such a house.——In the nature\r\nof things, nine times in ten, men of the elevated classes in the\r\ncommunity only can be chosen——Connecticut, for instance, will have\r\nfive representatives——not one man in a hundred of those who form\r\nthe democrative branch in the state legislature, will, on a fair\r\ncomputation, be one of the five.—The people of this country, in one\r\nsense, may all be democratic; but if we make the proper distinction\r\nbetween the few men of wealth and abilities, and consider them, as we\r\nought, as the natural aristocracy of the country, and the great body\r\nof the people, the middle and lower classes, as the democracy, this\r\nfederal representative branch will have but very little democracy\r\nin it, even this small representation is not secured on proper\r\nprinciples.——The branches of the legislature are essential parts\r\nof the fundamental compact, and ought to be so fixed by the people,\r\nthat the legislature cannot alter itself by modifying the elections\r\nof its own members. This, by a part of Art. I, Sect. 4, the general\r\nlegislature may do, it may evidently so regulate elections as to secure\r\nthe choice of any particular description of men.——It may make the\r\nwhole state one district—make the capital, or any places in the state,\r\nthe place or places of election—it may declare that the five men (or\r\nwhatever the number may be the state may chuse) who shall have the\r\nmost votes shall be considered as chosen. ——In this [17] case it\r\nis easy to perceive how the people who live scattered in the inland\r\ntowns will bestow their votes on different men—and how a few men in a\r\ncity, in any order or profession, may unite and place any five men they\r\nplease highest among those that may be voted for——and all this may be\r\ndone constitutionally, and by those silent operations, which are not\r\nimmediately perceived by the people in general.——I know it is urged,\r\nthat the general legislature will be disposed to regulate elections on\r\nfair and just principles:——This may be true—good men will generally\r\ngovern well with almost any constitution: but why in laying the\r\nfoundation of the social system, need we unnecessarily leave a door\r\nopen to improper regulations?—This is a very general and unguarded\r\nclause, and many evils may flow from that part which authorises the\r\ncongress to regulate elections.——Were it omitted, the regulations\r\nof elections would be solely in the respective states, where the\r\npeople are substantially represented; and where the elections ought\r\nto be regulated, otherwise to secure a representation from all parts\r\nof the community, in making the constitutions, we ought to provide\r\nfor dividing each state into a proper number of districts, and for\r\nconfining the electors in each district to the choice of some men, who\r\nshall have a permanent interest and residence in it; and also for this\r\nessential object, that the representative elected shall have a majority\r\nof the votes of those electors who shall attend and give their votes.\r\n\r\nIn considering the practicability of having a full and equal\r\nrepresentation of the people from all parts of the union, not only\r\ndistances and different opinions, customs and views, common in\r\nextensive tracts of country, are to be taken into view, but many\r\ndifferences peculiar to Eastern, Middle, and Southern States. These\r\ndifferences are not so perceivable among the members of congress, and\r\nmen of general information in the states, as among the men who would\r\nproperly form the democratic branch. The Eastern states are very\r\ndemocratic, and composed chiefly of moderate freeholders; they have but\r\nfew rich men and no slaves; the Southern states are composed chiefly\r\nof rich planters and slaves; they have but few moderate freeholders,\r\nand the prevailing influence, in them is generally a dissipated\r\naristocracy: The Middle states partake partly of the Eastern and partly\r\nof the Southern character.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, nothing could be more disjointed, unwieldly and incompetent\r\nto doing business with harmony and dispatch, than a federal house of\r\nrepresentatives properly numerous for the great objects of taxation,\r\n&c. collected from the federal states; whether such men would ever\r\nact in concert; whether they would not worry along a few years, and\r\nthen be the means of [18] separating the parts of the union, is very\r\nproblematical?——View this system in whatever form we can, propriety\r\nbrings us still to this point, a federal government possessed of\r\ngeneral and complete powers, as to those national objects which cannot\r\nwell come under the cognizance of the internal laws of the respective\r\nstates, and this federal government, accordingly, consisting of\r\nbranches not very numerous.\r\n\r\nThe house of representatives is on the plan of consolidation, but the\r\nsenate is entirely on the federal plan; and Delaware will have as\r\nmuch constitutional influence in the senate, as the largest state in\r\nthe union: and in this senate are lodged legislative, executive and\r\njudicial powers: Ten states in this union urge that they are small\r\nstates, nine of which were present in the convention.—They were\r\ninterested in collecting large powers into the hands of the senate, in\r\nwhich each state still will have its equal share of power. I suppose\r\nit was impracticable for the three large states, as they were called,\r\nto get the senate formed on any other principles: But this only\r\nproves, that we cannot form one general government on equal and just\r\nprinciples—and proves, that we ought not to lodge in it such extensive\r\npowers before we are convinced of the practicability of organizing it\r\non just and equal principles. The senate will consist of two members\r\nfrom each state, chosen by the state legislatures, every sixth year.\r\nThe clause referred to, respecting the elections of representatives,\r\nempowers the general legislature to regulate the elections of senators\r\nalso, “except as to the places of chusing senators.”—There is,\r\ntherefore, but little more security in the elections than in those of\r\nrepresentatives: Fourteen senators make a quorum for business, and a\r\nmajority of the senators present give the vote of the senate, except\r\nin giving judgment upon an impeachment, or in making treaties, or\r\nin expelling a member, when two-thirds of the senators present must\r\nagree.—The members of the legislature are not excluded from being\r\nelected to any military offices, or any civil offices, except those\r\ncreated, or the emoluments of which shall be increased by themselves:\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present, of either house, may expel a member\r\nat pleasure. The senate is an independent branch of the legislature, a\r\ncourt for trying impeachments, and also a part of the executive, having\r\na negative in the making of all treaties, and in appointing almost all\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe vice president is not a very important, if not an unnecessary part\r\nof the system—he may be a part of the senate at one period, and act as\r\nthe supreme executive magistrate at another.——The election of this\r\nofficer, as well as of the president of the United States seems to be\r\nproperly secured; but [19] when we examine the powers of the president,\r\nand the forms of the executive, we shall perceive that the general\r\ngovernment, in this part, will have a strong tendency to aristocracy,\r\nor the government of the few. The executive is, in fact, the president\r\nand senate in all transactions of any importance; the president is\r\nconnected with, or tied to the senate; he may always act with the\r\nsenate, but never can effectually counteract its views: The president\r\ncan appoint no officer, civil or military, who shall not be agreeable\r\nto the senate; and the presumption is, that the will of so important a\r\nbody will not be very easily controlled, and that it will exercise its\r\npowers with great address.\r\n\r\nIn the judicial department, powers ever kept distinct in well balanced\r\ngovernments, are no less improperly blended in the hands of the same\r\nmen—in the judges of the supreme court is lodged the law, the equity\r\nand the fact. It is not necessary to pursue the minute organical parts\r\nof the general government proposed.—There were various interests in\r\nthe convention, to be reconciled, especially of large and small states;\r\nof carrying and non-carrying states; and of states more and states\r\nless democratic—vast labour and attention were by the convention\r\nbestowed on the organization of the parts of the constitution offered;\r\nstill it is acknowledged there are many things radically wrong in the\r\nessential parts of this constitution—but it is said that these are\r\nthe result of our situation: On a full examination of the subject,\r\nI believe it; but what do the laborious inquiries and determination\r\nof the convention prove? If they prove any thing, they prove that we\r\ncannot consolidate the states on proper principles: The organization\r\nof the government presented proves, that we cannot form a general\r\ngovernment in which all power can be safely lodged; and a little\r\nattention to the parts of the one proposed will make it appear very\r\nevident, that all the powers proposed to be lodged in it, will not be\r\nthen well deposited, either for the purposes of government, or the\r\npreservation of liberty. I will suppose no abuse of power in those\r\ncases, in which the abuse of it is not well guarded against—I will\r\nsuppose the words authorizing the general government to regulate the\r\nelections of its own members struck out of the plan, or free district\r\nelections, in each state, amply secured.—That the small representation\r\nprovided for shall be as fair and equal as it is capable of being\r\nmade—I will suppose the judicial department regulated on pure\r\nprinciples, by future laws, as far as it can be by the constitution,\r\nand consist with the situation of the country—still there will be an\r\nunreasonable accumulation of powers in the general government if all be\r\ngranted, enumerated in the plan proposed. The plan does not present a\r\nwell balanced government: The senatorial [20] branch of the legislative\r\nand the executive are substantially united, and the president, or\r\nthe state executive magistrate, may aid the senatorial interest when\r\nweakest, but never can effectually support the democratic, however\r\nit may be opposed;—the excellency, in my mind, of a well-balanced\r\ngovernment is that it consists of distinct branches, each sufficiently\r\nstrong and independant to keep its own station, and to aid either of\r\nthe other branches which may occasionally want aid.\r\n\r\nThe convention found that any but a small house of representatives\r\nwould be expensive, and that it would be impracticable to assemble\r\na large number of representatives. Not only the determination of the\r\nconvention in this case, but the situation of the states, proves\r\nthe impracticability of collecting, in any one point, a proper\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the senate, and the smallness of the house, being,\r\ntherefore, the result of our situation, and the actual state of things,\r\nthe evils which may attend the exercise of many powers in this national\r\ngovernment may be considered as without a remedy.\r\n\r\nAll officers are impeachable before the senate only—before the men\r\nby whom they are appointed, or who are consenting to the appointment\r\nof these officers. No judgment of conviction, on an impeachment,\r\ncan be given unless two thirds of the senators agree. Under these\r\ncircumstances the right of impeachment, in the house, can be of but\r\nlittle importance; the house cannot expect often to convict the\r\noffender; and, therefore, probably, will but seldom or never exercise\r\nthe right. In addition to the insecurity and inconveniences attending\r\nthis organization beforementioned, it may be observed, that it is\r\nextremely difficult to secure the people against the fatal effects of\r\ncorruption and influence. The power of making any law will be in the\r\npresident, eight senators, and seventeen representatives, relative to\r\nthe important objects enumerated in the constitution. Where there is\r\na small representation a sufficient number to carry any measure, may,\r\nwith ease, be influenced by bribes, offices and civilities; they easily\r\nform private juntoes, and out-door meetings, agree on measures, and\r\ncarry them by silent votes.\r\n\r\nImpressed, as I am, with a sense of the difficulties there are in the\r\nway of forming the parts of a federal government on proper principles,\r\nand seeing a government so unsubstantially organized, after so arduous\r\nan attempt has been made, I am led to believe, that powers ought to be\r\ngiven to it with great care and caution.\r\n\r\nIn the second place it is necessary, therefore, to examine the extent,\r\nand the probable operations of some of those ex- [21] tensive powers\r\nproposed to be vested in this government. These powers, legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial, respect internal as well as external objects.\r\nThose respecting external objects, as all foreign concerns, commerce,\r\nimposts, all causes arising on the seas, peace and war, and Indian\r\naffairs, can be lodged no where else, with any propriety, but in this\r\ngovernment. Many powers that respect internal objects ought clearly to\r\nbe lodged in it; as those to regulate trade between the states, weights\r\nand measures, the coin or current monies, post-offices, naturalization,\r\n&c. These powers may be exercised without essentially effecting the\r\ninternal police of the respective states: But powers to lay and collect\r\ninternal taxes, to form the militia, to make bankrupt laws, and to\r\ndecide on appeals, questions arising on the internal laws of the\r\nrespective states, are of a very serious nature, and carry with them\r\nalmost all other powers. These taken in connection with the others, and\r\npowers to raise armies and build navies, proposed to be lodged in this\r\ngovernment, appear to me to comprehend all the essential powers in this\r\ncommunity, and those which will be left to the states will be of no\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\nA power to lay and collect taxes at discretion, is, in itself, of very\r\ngreat importance. By means of taxes, the government may command the\r\nwhole or any part of the subject’s property. Taxes may be of various\r\nkinds; but there is a strong distinction between external and internal\r\ntaxes. External taxes are import duties, which are laid on imported\r\ngoods; they may usually be collected in a few seaport towns, and of a\r\nfew individuals, though ultimately paid by the consumer; a few officers\r\ncan collect them, and they can be carried no higher than trade will\r\nbear, or smuggling permit—that in the very nature of commerce, bounds\r\nare set to them. But internal taxes, as poll and land taxes, excises,\r\nduties on all written instruments, &c. may fix themselves on every\r\nperson and species of property in the community; they may be carried to\r\nany lengths, and in proportion as they are extended, numerous officers\r\nmust be employed to assess them, and to enforce the collection of\r\nthem. In the United Netherlands the general government has compleat\r\npowers, as to external taxation; but as to internal taxes, it makes\r\nrequisitions on the provinces. Internal taxation in this country is\r\nmore important, as the country is so very extensive. As many assessors\r\nand collectors of federal taxes will be above three hundred miles from\r\nthe seat of the federal government as will be less. Besides, to lay and\r\ncollect taxes, in this extensive country, must require a great number\r\nof congressional ordinances immediately operating upon the body of the\r\npeople; these must continually interfere with the state laws, [22] and\r\nthereby produce disorder and general dissatisfaction, till the one\r\nsystem of laws or the other, operating on the same subjects, shall be\r\nabolished. These ordinances alone, to say nothing of those respecting\r\nthe militia, coin, commerce, federal judiciary, &c. &c. will probably\r\nsoon defeat the operations of the state laws and governments.\r\n\r\nShould the general government think it politic, as some administration\r\n(if not all) probably will, to look for a support in a system of\r\ninfluence, the government will take every occasion to multiply laws,\r\nand officers to execute them, considering these as so many necessary\r\nprops for its own support. Should this system of policy be adopted,\r\ntaxes more productive than the impost duties will, probably, be wanted\r\nto support the government, and to discharge foreign demands, without\r\nleaving any thing for the domestic creditors. The internal sources of\r\ntaxation then must be called into operation, and internal tax laws and\r\nfederal assessors and collectors spread over this immense country.\r\nAll these circumstances considered, is it wise, prudent, or safe, to\r\nvest the powers of laying and collecting internal taxes in the general\r\ngovernment, while imperfectly organized and inadequate; and to trust\r\nto amending it hereafter, and making it adequate to this purpose? It\r\nis not only unsafe but absurd to lodge power in a government before\r\nit is fitted to receive it. It is confessed that this power and\r\nrepresentation ought to go together. Why give the power first? Why\r\ngive the power to the few, who, when possessed of it, may have address\r\nenough to prevent the increase of representation? Why not keep the\r\npower, and, when necessary, amend the constitution, and add to its\r\nother parts this power, and a proper increase of representation at\r\nthe same time? Then men who may want the power will be under strong\r\ninducements to let in the people, by their representatives, into the\r\ngovernment, to hold their due proportion of this power. If a proper\r\nrepresentation be impracticable, then we shall see this power resting\r\nin the states, where it at present ought to be, and not inconsiderately\r\ngiven up.\r\n\r\nWhen I recollect how lately congress, conventions, legislatures, and\r\npeople contended in the cause of liberty, and carefully weighed the\r\nimportance of taxation, I can scarcely believe we are serious in\r\nproposing to vest the powers of laying and collecting internal taxes\r\nin a government so imperfectly organized for such purposes. Should\r\nthe United States be taxed by a house of representatives of two\r\nhundred members, which would be about fifteen members for Connecticut,\r\ntwenty-five for Massachusetts, &c. still the middle and lower classes\r\nof people could have no great share, in fact, in taxation. I am\r\naware it is said, that the representation proposed by the new [23]\r\nconstitution is sufficiently numerous; it may be for many purposes;\r\nbut to suppose that this branch is sufficiently numerous to guard the\r\nrights of the people in the administration of the government, in which\r\nthe purse and sword is placed, seems to argue that we have forgot\r\nwhat the true meaning of representation is. I am sensible also, that\r\nit is said that congress will not attempt to lay and collect internal\r\ntaxes; that it is necessary for them to have the power, though it\r\ncannot probably be exercised.——I admit that it is not probable that\r\nany prudent congress will attempt to lay and collect internal taxes,\r\nespecially direct taxes: but this only proves, that the power would be\r\nimproperly lodged in congress, and that it might be abused by imprudent\r\nand designing men.\r\n\r\nI have heard several gentlemen, to get rid of objections to this part\r\nof the constitution, attempt to construe the powers relative to direct\r\ntaxes, as those who object to it would have them; as to these, it is\r\nsaid, that congress will only have power to make requisitions, leaving\r\nit to the states to lay and collect them. I see but very little colour\r\nfor this construction, and the attempt only proves that this part of\r\nthe plan cannot be defended. By this plan there can be no doubt,\r\nbut that the powers of congress will be complete as to all kinds of\r\ntaxes whatever—Further, as to internal taxes, the state governments\r\nwill have concurrent powers with the general government, and both may\r\ntax the same objects in the same year; and the objection that the\r\ngeneral government may suspend a state tax, as a necessary measure\r\nfor the promoting the collection of a federal tax, is not without\r\nfoundation.——As the states owe large debts, and have large demands\r\nupon them individually, there clearly will be a propriety in leaving in\r\ntheir possession exclusively, some of the internal sources of taxation,\r\nat least until the federal representation shall be properly encreased:\r\nThe power in the general government to lay and collect internal taxes,\r\nwill render its powers respecting armies, navies and the militia, the\r\nmore exceptionable. By the constitution it is proposed that congress\r\nshall have power “to raise and support armies, but no appropriation\r\nof money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years; to\r\nprovide and maintain a navy; to provide for calling forth the militia\r\nto execute the laws of the union; suppress insurrections, and repel\r\ninvasions: to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\r\nmilitia;” reserving to the states the right to appoint the officers,\r\nand to train the militia according to the discipline prescribed by\r\ncongress; congress will have unlimited power to raise armies, and to\r\nengage officers and men for any number of years; but a legislative\r\nact applying money for their support can have operation for no longer\r\nterm than two years, and if a subsequent congress, do [24] not within\r\nthe two years renew the appropriation, or further appropriate monies\r\nfor the use of the army, the army will be left to take care of itself.\r\nWhen an army shall once be raised for a number of years, it is not\r\nprobable that it will find much difficulty in getting congress to pass\r\nlaws for applying monies to its support. I see so many men in America\r\nfond of a standing army, and especially among those who probably will\r\nhave a large share in administering the federal system; it is very\r\nevident to me, that we shall have a large standing army as soon as\r\nthe monies to support them can be possibly found. An army is not a\r\nvery agreeable place of employment for the young gentlemen of many\r\nfamilies. A power to raise armies must be lodged some where; still\r\nthis will not justify the lodging this power in a bare majority of so\r\nfew men without any checks; or in the government in which the great\r\nbody of the people, in the nature of things, will be only nominally\r\nrepresented. In the state governments the great body of the people,\r\nthe yeomanry, &c. of the country, are represented: It is true they\r\nwill chuse the members of congress, and may now and then chuse a man\r\nof their own way of thinking; but it is not impossible for forty, or\r\nthirty thousand people in this country, one time in ten to find a man\r\nwho can possess similar feelings, views, and interests with themselves:\r\nPowers to lay and collect taxes and to raise armies are of the greatest\r\nmoment; for carrying them into effect, laws need not be frequently\r\nmade, and the yeomanry, &c. of the country ought substantially to have\r\na check upon the passing of these laws; this check ought to be placed\r\nin the legislatures, or at least, in the few men the common people of\r\nthe country, will, probably, have in congress, in the true sense of\r\nthe word, “from among themselves.” It is true, the yeomanry of the\r\ncountry possess the lands, the weight of property, possess arms, and\r\nare too strong a body of men to be openly offended—and, therefore,\r\nit is urged, they will take care of themselves, that men who shall\r\ngovern will not dare pay any disrespect to their opinions. It is easily\r\nperceived, that if they have not their proper negative upon passing\r\nlaws in congress, or on the passage of laws relative to taxes and\r\narmies, they may in twenty or thirty years be by means imperceptible to\r\nthem, totally deprived of that boasted weight and strength: This may be\r\ndone in a great measure by congress, if disposed to do it, by modelling\r\nthe militia. Should one fifth or one eighth part of the men capable of\r\nbearing arms, be made a select militia, as has been proposed, and those\r\nthe young and ardent part of the community, possessed of but little\r\nor no property, and all the others put upon a plan that will render\r\nthem of no importance, the former will answer all the purposes of an\r\n[25] army, while the latter will be defenceless. The state must train\r\nthe militia in such form and according to such systems and rules as\r\ncongress shall prescribe: and the only actual influence the respective\r\nstates will have respecting the militia will be in appointing the\r\nofficers. I see no provision made for calling out the _posse comitatus_\r\nfor executing the laws of the union, but provision is made for congress\r\nto call forth the militia for the execution of them—and the militia\r\nin general, or any select part of it, may be called out under military\r\nofficers, instead of the sheriff to enforce an execution of federal\r\nlaws, in the first instance, and thereby introduce an entire military\r\nexecution of the laws. I know that powers to raise taxes, to regulate\r\nthe military strength of the community on some uniform plan, to provide\r\nfor its defence and internal order, and for duly executing the laws,\r\nmust be lodged somewhere; but still we ought not so to lodge them, as\r\nevidently to give one order of men in the community, undue advantages\r\nover others; or commit the many to the mercy, prudence, and moderation\r\nof the few. And so far as it may be necessary to lodge any of the\r\npeculiar powers in the general government, a more safe exercise of\r\nthem ought to be secured, by requiring the consent of two-thirds or\r\nthree-fourths of congress thereto—until the federal representation can\r\nbe increased, so that the democratic members in congress may stand some\r\ntolerable chance of a reasonable negative, in behalf of the numerous,\r\nimportant, and democratic part of the community.\r\n\r\nI am not sufficiently acquainted with the laws and internal police of\r\nall the states to discern fully, how general bankrupt laws, made by the\r\nunion, would effect them, or promote the public good. I believe the\r\nproperty of debtors, in the several states, is held responsible for\r\ntheir debts in modes and forms very different. If uniform bankrupt laws\r\ncan be made without producing real and substantial inconveniences, I\r\nwish them to be made by congress.\r\n\r\nThere are some powers proposed to be lodged in the general government\r\nin the judicial department, I think very unnecessarily, I mean\r\npowers respecting questions arising upon the internal laws of the\r\nrespective states. It is proper the federal judiciary should have\r\npowers co-extensive with the federal legislature—that is, the power\r\nof deciding finally on the laws of the union. By Art. 3, Sec. 2. the\r\npowers of the federal judiciary are extended (among other things)\r\nto all cases between a state and citizens of another state—between\r\ncitizens of different states—between a state or the citizens thereof,\r\nand foreign states, citizens or subjects. Actions in all these cases,\r\nexcept against a state government, are now brought and finally [26]\r\ndetermined in the law courts of the states respectively and as there\r\nare no words to exclude these courts of their jurisdiction in these\r\ncases, they will have concurrent jurisdiction with the inferior federal\r\ncourts in them; and, therefore, if the new constitution be adopted\r\nwithout any amendment in this respect, all those numerous actions,\r\nnow brought in the state courts between our citizens and foreigners,\r\nbetween citizens of different states, by state governments against\r\nforeigners, and by state governments against citizens of other states,\r\nmay also be brought in the federal courts; and an appeal will lay in\r\nthem from the state courts or federal inferior courts to the supreme\r\njudicial court of the union. In almost all these cases, either party\r\nmay have the trial by jury in the state courts; except paper money\r\nand tender laws, which are wisely guarded against in the proposed\r\nconstitution; justice may be obtained in these courts on reasonable\r\nterms; they must be more competent to proper decisions on the laws of\r\ntheir respective states, than the federal states can possibly be. I do\r\nnot, in any point of view, see the need of opening a new jurisdiction\r\nin these causes—of opening a new scene of expensive law suits, of\r\nsuffering foreigners, and citizens of different states, to drag each\r\nother many hundred miles into the federal courts. It is true, those\r\ncourts may be so organized by a wise and prudent legislature, as to\r\nmake the obtaining of justice in them tolerably easy; they may in\r\ngeneral be organized on the common law principles of the country: But\r\nthis benefit is by no means secured by the constitution. The trial by\r\njury is secured only in those few criminal cases, to which the federal\r\nlaws will extend—as crimes committed on the seas, against the laws\r\nof nations, treason and counterfeiting the federal securities and\r\ncoin: But even in these cases, the jury trial of the vicinage is not\r\nsecured—particularly in the large states, a citizen may be tried\r\nfor a crime committed in the state, and yet tried in some states 500\r\nmiles from the place where it was committed; but the jury trial is\r\nnot secured at all in civil causes. Though the convention have not\r\nestablished this trial, it is to be hoped that congress, in putting\r\nthe new system into execution, will do it by a legislative act, in\r\nall cases in which it can be done with propriety. Whether the jury\r\ntrial is not excluded the supreme judicial court is an important\r\nquestion. By Art. 3, Sec. 2, all cases affecting ambassadors, other\r\npublic ministers, and consuls, and in those cases in which a state\r\nshall be party, the supreme court shall have jurisdiction. In all the\r\nother cases beforementioned, the supreme court shall have appellate\r\njurisdiction, both as to _law and fact_, with such exception, and under\r\nsuch regulations as the congress shall make. By court is understood a\r\ncourt consisting of judges; and the [27] idea of a jury is excluded.\r\nThis court, or the judges, are to have jurisdiction on appeals, in all\r\nthe cases enumerated, as to law and fact; the judges are to decide the\r\nlaw and try the fact, and the trial of the fact being assigned to the\r\njudges by the constitution, a jury for trying the fact is excluded;\r\nhowever, under the exceptions and powers to make regulations, congress\r\nmay, perhaps, introduce the jury, to try the fact in most necessary\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThere can be but one supreme court in which the final jurisdiction\r\nwill centre in all federal causes—except in cases where appeals by\r\nlaw shall not be allowed: The judicial powers of the federal courts\r\nextend in law and equity to certain cases: and, therefore, the\r\npowers to determine on the law, in equity, and as to the fact, all\r\nwill concentrate in the supreme court:—These powers, which by this\r\nconstitution are blended in the same hands, the same judges, are in\r\nGreat-Britain deposited in different hands—to wit, the decision of\r\nthe law in the law judges, the decision in equity in the chancellor,\r\nand the trial of the fact in the jury. It is a very dangerous thing to\r\nvest in the same judge power to decide on the law, and also general\r\npowers in equity; for if the law restrain him, he is only to step into\r\nhis shoes of equity, and give what judgment his reason or opinion may\r\ndictate; we have no precedents in this country, as yet, to regulate\r\nthe divisions in equity as in Great Britain; equity, therefore, in the\r\nsupreme court for many years will be mere discretion. I confess in the\r\nconstitution of this supreme court, as left by the constitution, I do\r\nnot see a spark of freedom or a shadow of our own or the British common\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThis court is to have appellate jurisdiction in all the other cases\r\nbefore mentioned: Many sensible men suppose that cases before mentioned\r\nrespect, as well the criminal cases as the civil ones mentioned\r\nantecedently in the constitution, if so an appeal is allowed in\r\ncriminal cases—contrary to the usual sense of law. How far it may be\r\nproper to admit a foreigner or the citizen of another state to bring\r\nactions against state governments, which have failed in performing\r\nso many, promises made during the war is doubtful: How far it may be\r\nproper so to humble a state, as to oblige it to answer to an individual\r\nin a court of law, is worthy of consideration; the states are now\r\nsubject to no such actions; and this new jurisdiction will subject the\r\nstates, and many defendants to actions, and processes, which were not\r\nin the contemplation of the parties, when the contract was made; all\r\nengagements existing between citizens of different states, citizens and\r\nforeigners, states and foreigners; and states and citizens of other\r\nstates were made the parties contemplating the remedies then existing\r\non the laws of the states—— [28] and the new remedy proposed to be\r\ngiven in the federal courts, can be founded on no principle whatever.\r\n\r\n  Your’s, &c.,\r\n\r\n  THE FEDERAL FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\n  OCTOBER 12TH, 1787.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIt will not be possible to establish in the federal courts the jury\r\ntrial of the vicinage so well as in the state courts.\r\n\r\nThird, there appears to me to be not only a premature deposit of some\r\nimportant powers in the general government—but many of those deposited\r\nthere are undefined, and may be used to good or bad purposes as honest\r\nor designing men shall prevail. By Art. 1, Sec. 2, representatives and\r\ndirect taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, &c.——same\r\nart. sect. 8, the congress shall have powers to lay and collect taxes,\r\nduties, &c. for the common defence and general welfare, but all duties,\r\nimposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States:\r\nBy the first recited clause, direct taxes shall be apportioned on the\r\nstates. This seems to favour the idea suggested by some sensible men\r\nand writers that congress, as to direct taxes, will only have power\r\nto make requisitions; but the latter clause, power to lay and collect\r\ntaxes, &c. seems clearly to favour the contrary opinion, and, in my\r\nmind, the true one, the congress shall have power to tax immediately\r\nindividuals, without the intervention of the state legislatures, in\r\nfact the first clause appears to me only to provide that each state\r\nshall pay a certain portion of the tax, and the latter to provide that\r\ncongress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, that is to assess\r\nupon, and to collect of the individuals in the state, the states quota;\r\nbut these still I consider as undefined powers, because judicious men\r\nunderstand them differently.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the vice-president is to have any\r\nqualifications; none are mentioned; but he may serve as president,\r\nand it may be inferred, he ought to be qualified therefore as the\r\npresident; but the qualifications of the president are required only\r\nof the person to be elected president. By art. 2, sect. 2, “But the\r\ncongress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as\r\nthey think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or\r\nin the heads of the departments.” Who are inferior officers? May not\r\na congress disposed to vest the appointment of all officers in the\r\npresident, [29] under this clause, vest the appointment of almost every\r\nofficer in the president alone, and destroy the check mentioned in the\r\nfirst part of the clause, and lodged in the senate. It is true, this\r\ncheck is badly lodged, but then some check upon the first magistrate in\r\nappointing officers, ought it appears by the opinion of the convention,\r\nand by the general opinion, to be established in the constitution. By\r\nart. 3, sect. 2, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction\r\nas to law and facts with such exceptions, &c. to what extent is it\r\nintended the exceptions shall be carried—Congress may carry them so\r\nfar as to annihilate substantially the appellate jurisdiction, and the\r\nclause be rendered of very little importance.\r\n\r\n4th. There are certain rights which we have always held sacred in the\r\nUnited States, and recognized in all our constitutions, and which, by\r\nthe adoption of the new constitution in its present form, will be left\r\nunsecured. By article 6, the proposed constitution, and the laws of\r\nthe United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all\r\ntreaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United\r\nStates, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every\r\nstate shall be bound thereby; anything in the constitution or laws of\r\nany state to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that when the people shall adopt the proposed\r\nconstitution it will be their last and supreme act; it will be adopted\r\nnot by the people of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, &c., but by the\r\npeople of the United States; and wherever this constitution, or any\r\npart of it, shall be incompatible with the ancient customs, rights, the\r\nlaws or the constitutions heretofore established in the United States,\r\nit will entirely abolish them and do them away: And not only this, but\r\nthe laws of the United States which shall be; made in pursuance of\r\nthe federal constitution will be also supreme laws, and wherever they\r\nshall be incompatible with those customs, rights, laws or constitutions\r\nheretofore established, they will also entirely abolish them and do\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\nBy the article before recited, treaties also made under the authority\r\nof the United States, shall be the supreme law: It is not said that\r\nthese treaties shall be made in pursuance of the constitution—nor\r\nare there any constitutional bounds set to those who shall make them:\r\nThe president and two-thirds of the senate will be empowered to make\r\ntreaties indefinitely, and when these treaties shall be made, they will\r\nalso abolish all laws and state constitutions incompatible with them.\r\nThis power in the president and senate is absolute, and the judges\r\nwill be bound to allow full force to whatever rule, article or thing\r\nthe president and senate shall establish by treaty, whether it be [30]\r\npracticable to set any bounds to those who make treaties, I am not\r\nable to say; if not, it proves that this power ought to be more safely\r\nlodged.\r\n\r\nThe federal constitution, the laws of congress made in pursuance of\r\nthe constitution, and all treaties must have full force and effect\r\nin all parts of the United States; and all other laws, rights and\r\nconstitutions which stand in their way must yield: It is proper the\r\nnational laws should be supreme, and superior to state or district\r\nlaws; but then the national laws ought to yield to unalienable or\r\nfundamental rights——and national laws, made by a few men, should\r\nextend only to a few national objects. This will not be the case with\r\nthe laws of congress: To have any proper idea of their extent, we\r\nmust carefully examine the legislative, executive and judicial powers\r\nproposed to be lodged in the general government, and consider them in\r\nconnection with a general clause in art. 1, sect. 8, in these words\r\n(after enumerating a number of powers) “To make all laws which shall be\r\nnecessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers,\r\nand all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of\r\nthe United States, or in any department or officer thereof.”——The\r\npowers of this government as has been observed, extend to internal as\r\nwell as external objects, and to those objects to which all others are\r\nsubordinate; it is almost impossible to have a just conception of their\r\npowers, or of the extent and number of the laws which may be deemed\r\nnecessary and proper to carry them into effect, till we shall come\r\nto exercise those powers and make the laws. In making laws to carry\r\nthose powers into effect, it is to be expected, that a wise and prudent\r\ncongress will pay respect to the opinions of a free people, and bottom\r\ntheir laws on those principles which have been considered as essential\r\nand fundamental in the British, and in our government: But a congress\r\nof a different character will not be bound by the constitution to pay\r\nrespect to those principles.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when people make a constitution, and delegate powers,\r\nthat all powers are not delegated by them to those who govern, is\r\nreserved in the people; and that the people, in the present case,\r\nhave reserved in themselves, and in their state governments, every\r\nright and power not expressly given by the federal constitution to\r\nthose who shall administer the national government. It is said, on the\r\nother hand, that the people, when they make a constitution, yield all\r\npower not expressly reserved to themselves. The truth is, in either\r\ncase, it is mere matter of opinion, and men usually take either side\r\nof the argument, as will best answer their purposes: But the general\r\n[31] presumption being, that men who govern, will in doubtful cases,\r\nconstrue laws and constitutions most favourably for increasing their\r\nown powers; all wise and prudent people, in forming constitutions,\r\nhave drawn the line, and carefully described the powers parted with\r\nand the powers reserved. By the state constitutions, certain rights\r\nhave been reserved in the people; or rather, they have been recognized\r\nand established in such a manner, that state legislatures are bound\r\nto respect them, and to make no laws infringing upon them. The state\r\nlegislatures are obliged to take notice of the bills of rights of their\r\nrespective states. The bills of rights, and the state constitutions,\r\nare fundamental compacts only between those who govern, and the people\r\nof the same state.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1788 the people of the United States made a federal\r\nconstitution, which is a fundamental compact between them and their\r\nfederal rulers; these rulers, in the nature of things, cannot be\r\nbound to take notice of any other compact. It would be absurd for\r\nthem, in making laws, to look over thirteen, fifteen, or twenty state\r\nconstitutions, to see what rights are established as fundamental, and\r\nmust not be infringed upon, in making laws in the society. It is true,\r\nthey would be bound to do it if the people, in their federal compact,\r\nshould refer to the state constitutions, recognize all parts not\r\ninconsistent with the federal constitution, and direct their federal\r\nrulers to take notice of them accordingly; but this is not the case,\r\nas the plan stands proposed at present; and it is absurd, to suppose\r\nso unnatural an idea is intended or implied. I think my opinion is not\r\nonly founded in reason, but I think it is supported by the report of\r\nthe convention itself. If there are a number of rights established by\r\nthe state constitutions, and which will remain sacred, and the general\r\ngovernment is bound to take notice of them—it must take notice of one\r\nas well as another; and if unnecessary to recognize or establish one\r\nby the federal constitution, it would be unnecessary to recognize or\r\nestablish another by it. If the federal constitution is to be construed\r\nso far in connection with the state constitution, as to leave the\r\ntrial by jury in civil causes, for instance, secured; on the same\r\nprinciples it would have left the trial by jury in criminal causes,\r\nthe benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, &c. secured; they all stand\r\non the same footing; they are the common rights of Americans, and have\r\nbeen recognized by the state constitutions: But the convention found\r\nit necessary to recognize or re-establish the benefits of that writ,\r\nand the jury trial in criminal cases. As to _expost facto_ laws, the\r\nconvention has done the same in one case, and gone further in another.\r\nIt is a part of the com- [32] pact between the people of each state\r\nand their rulers, that no _expost facto_ laws shall be made. But the\r\nconvention, by Art. 1, Sect. 10, have put a sanction upon this part\r\neven of the state compacts. In fact, the 9th and 10th Sections in\r\nArt. 1, in the proposed constitution, are no more nor less, than a\r\npartial bill of rights; they establish certain principles as part of\r\nthe compact upon which the federal legislators and officers can never\r\ninfringe. It is here wisely stipulated, that the federal legislature\r\nshall never pass a bill of attainder, or _expost facto_ law; that no\r\ntax shall be laid on articles exported, &c. The establishing of one\r\nright implies the necessity of establishing another and similar one.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the position appears to me to be undeniable, that this\r\nbill of rights ought to be carried farther, and some other principles\r\nestablished, as a part of this fundamental compact between the people\r\nof the United States and their federal rulers.\r\n\r\nIt is true, we are not disposed to differ much, at present, about\r\nreligion; but when we are making a constitution, it is to be hoped, for\r\nages and millions yet unborn, why not establish the free exercise of\r\nreligion, as a part of the national compact. There are other essential\r\nrights, which we have justly understood to be the rights of freemen;\r\nas freedom from hasty and unreasonable search warrants, warrants\r\nnot founded on oath, and not issued with due caution, for searching\r\nand seizing men’s papers, property, and persons. The trials by jury\r\nin civil causes, it is said, varies so much in the several states,\r\nthat no words could be found for the uniform establishment of it. If\r\nso, the federal legislation will not be able to establish it by any\r\ngeneral laws. I confess I am of opinion it may be established, but not\r\nin that beneficial manner in which we may enjoy it, for the reasons\r\nbeforementioned. When I speak of the jury trial of the vicinage, or\r\nthe trial of the fact in the neighborhood, I do not lay so much stress\r\nupon the circumstance of our being tried by our neighbours: in this\r\nenlightened country men may be probably impartially tried by those who\r\ndo not live very near them: but the trial of facts in the neighbourhood\r\nis of great importance in other respects. Nothing can be more essential\r\nthan the cross examining witnesses, and generally before the triers of\r\nthe facts in question. The common people can establish facts with much\r\nmore ease with oral than written evidence; when trials of facts are\r\nremoved to a distance from the homes of the parties and witnesses, oral\r\nevidence becomes intolerably expensive, and the parties must depend on\r\nwritten evidence, which to the common people is expensive and almost\r\n[33] useless; it must be frequently taken ex porte, and but very seldom\r\nleads to the proper discovery of truth.\r\n\r\nThe trial by jury is very important in another point of view. It is\r\nessential in every free country, that common people should have a part\r\nand share of influence, in the judicial as well as in the legislative\r\ndepartment. To hold open to them the offices of senators, judges,\r\nand offices to fill which an expensive education is required, cannot\r\nanswer any valuable purposes for them; they are not in a situation to\r\nbe brought forward and to fill those offices; these, and most other\r\noffices of any considerable importance, will be occupied by the few.\r\nThe few, the well born, &c. as Mr. Adams calls them, in judicial\r\ndecisions as well as in legislation, are generally disposed, and very\r\nnaturally too, to favour those of their own description.\r\n\r\nThe trial by jury in the judicial department, and the collection of\r\nthe people by their representatives in the legislature, are those\r\nfortunate inventions which have procured for them, in this country,\r\ntheir true proportion of influence, and the wisest and most fit means\r\nof protecting themselves in the community. Their situation, as jurors\r\nand representatives, enables them to acquire information and knowledge\r\nin the affairs and government of the society; and to come forward,\r\nin turn, as the sentinels and guardians of each other. I am very\r\nsorry that even a few of our countrymen should consider jurors and\r\nrepresentatives in a different point of view, as ignorant, troublesome\r\nbodies, which ought not to have any share in the concerns of government.\r\n\r\nI confess I do not see in what cases the congress can, with any\r\npretence of right, make a law to suppress the freedom of the press;\r\nthough I am not clear, that congress is restrained from laying any\r\nduties whatever on printing, and from laying duties particularly heavy\r\non certain pieces printed, and perhaps congress may require large bonds\r\nfor the payment of these duties. Should the printer say, the freedom\r\nof the press was secured by the constitution of the state in which he\r\nlived, congress might, and perhaps, with great propriety, answer, that\r\nthe federal constitution is the only compact existing between them\r\nand the people; in this compact the people have named no others, and\r\ntherefore congress, in exercising the powers assigned them, and in\r\nmaking laws to carry them into execution, are restrained by nothing\r\nbeside the federal constitution, any more than a state legislature is\r\nrestrained by a compact between the magistrates and people of a county,\r\ncity, or town of which the people, in forming the state constitution,\r\nhave taken no notice.\r\n\r\nIt is not my object to enumerate rights of inconsiderable [34]\r\nimportance; but there are others, no doubt, which ought to be\r\nestablished as a fundamental part of the national system.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, that all treaties are made by foreign\r\nnations with a confederacy of thirteen states—that the western country\r\nis attached to thirteen states—thirteen states have jointly and\r\nseverally engaged to pay the public debts.—Should a new government be\r\nformed of nine, ten, eleven, or twelve states, those treaties could\r\nnot be considered as binding on the foreign nations who made them.\r\nHowever, I believe the probability to be, that if nine states adopt the\r\nconstitution, the others will.\r\n\r\nIt may also be worthy our examination, how far the provision for\r\namending this plan, when it shall be adopted, is of any importance.\r\nNo measures can be taken towards amendments, unless two-thirds of the\r\ncongress, or two-thirds of the legislature of the several states shall\r\nagree.—While power is in the hands of the people, or democratic part\r\nof the community, more especially as at present, it is easy, according\r\nto the general course of human affairs, for the few influential men in\r\nthe community, to obtain conventions, alterations in government, and to\r\npersuade the common people that they may change for the better, and to\r\nget from them a part of the power. But when power is once transferred\r\nfrom the many to the few, all changes become extremely difficult; the\r\ngovernment, in this case, being beneficial to the few, they will be\r\nexceedingly artful and adroit in preventing any measures which may\r\nlead to a change; and nothing will produce it, but great exertions\r\nand severe struggles on the part of the common people. Every man of\r\nreflection must see, that the change now proposed, is a transfer of\r\npower from the many to the few, and the probability is, the artful\r\nand ever active aristocracy, will prevent all peaceful measures for\r\nchanges, unless when they shall discover some favorable moment to\r\nincrease their own influence. I am sensible, thousands of men in\r\nthe United States, are disposed to adopt the proposed constitution,\r\nthough they perceive it to be essentially defective, under an idea that\r\namendments of it, may be obtained when necessary. This is a pernicious\r\nidea, it argues a servility of character totally unfit for the support\r\nof free government; it is very repugnant to that perpetual jealousy\r\nrespecting liberty, so absolutely necessary in all free states, spoken\r\nof by Mr. Dickinson.—However, if our countrymen are so soon changed,\r\nand the language of 1774, is become odious to them, it will be in\r\nvain to use the language of freedom, or to attempt to rouse them to\r\nfree enquiries: But I shall never believe this is the case with them,\r\nwhatever present appearances may be, till I shall have very strong\r\nevidence indeed of it.\r\n\r\n  Your’s, &c.\r\n\r\n  THE FEDERAL FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[35] LETTER V.\r\n\r\n  OCTOBER 15th, 1787.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThus I have examined the federal constitution as far as a few days\r\nleisure would permit. It opens to my mind a new scene; instead of\r\nseeing powers cautiously lodged in the hands of numerous legislators,\r\nand many magistrates, we see all important powers collecting in one\r\ncentre, where a few men will possess them almost at discretion. And\r\ninstead of checks in the formation of the government, to secure the\r\nrights of the people against the usurpations of those they appoint to\r\ngovern, we are to understand the equal division of lands among our\r\npeople, and the strong arm furnished them by nature and situation, are\r\nto secure them against those usurpations. If there are advantages in\r\nthe equal division of our lands, and the strong and manly habits of our\r\npeople, we ought to establish governments calculated to give duration\r\nto them, and not governments which never can work naturally, till\r\nthat equality of property, and those free and manly habits shall be\r\ndestroyed; these evidently are not the natural basis of the proposed\r\nconstitution. No man of reflection, and skilled in the science of\r\ngovernment, can suppose these will move on harmoniously together for\r\nages, or even for fifty years. As to the little circumstances commented\r\nupon, by some writers, with applause—as the age of a representative,\r\nof the president, &c.—they have, in my mind, no weight in the general\r\ntendency of the system.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, in my opinion, many good things in the proposed\r\nsystem. It is founded on elective principles, and the deposits of\r\npowers in different hands, is essentially right. The guards against\r\nthose evils we have experienced in some states in legislation are\r\nvaluable indeed; but the value of every feature in this system is\r\nvastly lessened for the want of that one important feature in a free\r\ngovernment, a representation of the people. Because we have sometimes\r\nabused democracy, I am not among those men who think a democratic\r\nbranch a nuisance; which branch shall be sufficiently numerous to admit\r\nsome of the best informed men of each order in the community into the\r\nadministration of government.\r\n\r\nWhile the radical defects in the proposed system are not so soon\r\ndiscovered, some temptations to each state, and to many classes of\r\nmen to adopt it, are very visible. It uses the democratic language of\r\nseveral of the state constitutions, particularly that of Massachusetts;\r\nthe eastern states will receive advantages so far as the regulation\r\nof trade, by a bare majority, is committed to it: Connecticut and New\r\nJersey will receive their share of a [36] general impost: The middle\r\nstates will receive the advantages surrounding the seat of government;\r\nThe southern states will receive protection, and have their negroes\r\nrepresented in the legislature, and large back countries will soon have\r\na majority in it. This system promises a large field of employment\r\nto military gentlemen, and gentlemen of the law; and in case the\r\ngovernment shall be executed without convulsions, it will afford\r\nsecurity to creditors, to the clergy, salary-men and others depending\r\non money payments. So far as the system promises justice and reasonable\r\nadvantages, in these respects, it ought to be supported by all honest\r\nmen; but whenever it promises unequal and improper advantages to any\r\nparticular states, or orders of men, it ought to be opposed.\r\n\r\nI have, in the course of these letters observed, that there are many\r\ngood things in the proposed constitution, and I have endeavored to\r\npoint out many important defects in it. I have admitted that we want a\r\nfederal system—that we have a system presented, which, with several\r\nalterations may be made a tolerable good one—I have admitted there\r\nis a well founded uneasiness among creditors and mercantile men. In\r\nthis situation of things, you ask me what I think ought to be done? My\r\nopinion in this case is only the opinion of an individual, and so far\r\nonly as it corresponds with the opinions of the honest and substantial\r\npart of the community, is it entitled to consideration. Though I am\r\nfully satisfied that the state conventions ought most seriously to\r\ndirect their exertions to altering and amending the system proposed\r\nbefore they shall adopt it—yet I have not sufficiently examined the\r\nsubject, or formed an opinion, how far it will be practicable for those\r\nconventions to carry their amendments. As to the idea, that it will\r\nbe in vain for those conventions to attempt amendments, it cannot be\r\nadmitted; it is impossible to say whether they can or not until the\r\nattempt shall be made; and when it shall be determined, by experience,\r\nthat the conventions cannot agree in amendments, it will then be an\r\nimportant question before the people of the United States, whether they\r\nwill adopt or not the system proposed in its present form. This subject\r\nof consolidating the states is new: and because forty or fifty men\r\nhave agreed in a system, to suppose the good sense of this country, an\r\nenlightened nation, must adopt it without examination, and though in a\r\nstate of profound peace, without endeavouring to amend those parts they\r\nperceive are defective, dangerous to freedom, and destructive of the\r\nvaluable principles of republican government—is truly humiliating. It\r\nis true there may be danger in delay; but there is danger in adopting\r\nthe system in its present form; and I see the danger in either case\r\nwill arise principally from the conduct and views of [37] two very\r\nunprincipled parties in the United States—two fires, between which\r\nthe honest and substantial people have long found themselves situated.\r\nOne party is composed of little insurgents, men in debt, who want no\r\nlaw, and who want a share of the property of others; these are called\r\nlevellers, Shayites, &c. The other party is composed of a few, but\r\nmore dangerous men, with their servile dependents; these avariciously\r\ngrasp at all power and property; you may discover in all the actions of\r\nthese men, an evident dislike to free and equal government, and they\r\nwill go systematically to work to change, essentially, the forms of\r\ngovernment in this country; these are called aristocrats, m——ites,\r\n&c. &c. Between these two parties is the weight of the community; the\r\nmen of middling property, men not in debt on the one hand, and men,\r\non the other, content with republican governments, and not aiming at\r\nimmense fortunes, offices, and power. In 1786, the little insurgents,\r\nthe levellers, came forth, invaded the rights of others, and attempted\r\nto establish governments according to their wills. Their movements\r\nevidently gave encouragement to the other party, which, in 1787, has\r\ntaken the political field, and with its fashionable dependants, and\r\nthe tongue and the pen, is endeavoring to establish in a great haste,\r\na politer kind of government. These two parties, which will probably\r\nbe opposed or united as it may suit their interests and views, are\r\nreally insignificant, compared with the solid, free, and independent\r\npart of the community. It is not my intention to suggest, that either\r\nof these parties, and the real friends of the proposed constitution,\r\nare the same men. The fact is, these aristocrats support and hasten the\r\nadoption of the proposed constitution, merely because they think it is\r\na stepping stone to their favorite object. I think I am well founded\r\nin this idea; I think the general politics of these men support it,\r\nas well as the common observation among them, that the proffered plan\r\nis the best that can be got at present, it will do for a few years,\r\nand lead to something better. The sensible and judicious part of the\r\ncommunity will carefully weigh all these circumstances; they will view\r\nthe late convention as a respectable body of men—America probably\r\nnever will see an assembly of men, of a like number, more respectable.\r\nBut the members of the convention met without knowing the sentiments\r\nof one man in ten thousand in these states respecting the new ground\r\ntaken. Their doings are but the first attempts in the most important\r\nscene ever opened. Though each individual in the state conventions will\r\nnot, probably, be so respectable as each individual in the federal\r\nconvention, yet as the state conventions will probably consist of\r\nfifteen hundred or two thousand men of abilities, and versed in the\r\nscience of government, [38] collected from all parts of the community\r\nand from all orders of men, it must be acknowledged that the weight of\r\nrespectability will be in them.—In them will be collected the solid\r\nsense and the real political character of the country. Being revisers\r\nof the subject, they will possess peculiar advantages. To say that\r\nthese conventions ought not to attempt, coolly and deliberately, the\r\nrevision of the system, or that they cannot amend it, is very foolish\r\nor very assuming. If these conventions, after examining the system,\r\nadopt it, I shall be perfectly satisfied, and wish to see men make the\r\nadministration of the government an equal blessing to all orders of\r\nmen. I believe the great body of our people to be virtuous and friendly\r\nto good government, to the protection of liberty and property; and\r\nit is the duty of all good men, especially of those who are placed\r\nas sentinels to guard their rights—it is their duty to examine into\r\nthe prevailing politics of parties, and to disclose them—while they\r\navoid exciting undue suspicions, to lay facts before the people, which\r\nwill enable them to form a proper judgment. Men who wish the people of\r\nthis country to determine for themselves, and deliberately to fit the\r\ngovernment to their situation, must feel some degree of indignation at\r\nthose attempts to hurry the adoption of a system, and to shut the door\r\nagainst examination. The very attempts create suspicions, that those\r\nwho make them have secret views, or see some defects in the system,\r\nwhich, in the hurry of affairs, they expect will escape the eye of a\r\nfree people.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the views of those gentlemen in Pennsylvania, who\r\nprecipitated decisions on this subject? What can be the views of\r\nthose gentlemen in Boston, who countenanced the Printers in shutting\r\nup the press against a fair and free investigation of this important\r\nsystem in the usual way. The members of the convention have done their\r\nduty——why should some of them fly to their states——almost forget a\r\npropriety of behaviour, and precipitate measures for the adoption of a\r\nsystem of their own making? I confess candidly, when I consider these\r\ncircumstances in connection with the unguarded parts of the system I\r\nhave mentioned, I feel disposed to proceed with very great caution,\r\nand to pay more attention than usual to the conduct of particular\r\ncharacters. If the constitution presented be a good one, it will stand\r\nthe test with a well informed people: all are agreed that there shall\r\nbe state conventions to examine it; and we must believe it will be\r\nadopted, unless we suppose it is a bad one, or that those conventions\r\nwill make false divisions respecting it. I admit improper measures\r\nare taken against the adoption of the system as well for it——all\r\nwho object to the plan proposed ought to point out the defects [39]\r\nobjected to, and to propose those amendments with which they can accept\r\nit, or to propose some other system of government, that the public\r\nmind may be known, and that we may be brought to agree in some system\r\nof government, to strengthen and execute the present, or to provide\r\na substitute. I consider the field of enquiry just opened, and that\r\nwe are to look to the state conventions for ultimate decisions on the\r\nsubject before us; it is not to be presumed, that they will differ\r\nabout small amendments, and lose a system when they shall have made\r\nit substantially good; but touching the essential amendments, it is\r\nto be presumed the several conventions will pursue the most rational\r\nmeasures to agree in and obtain them; and such defects as they shall\r\ndiscover and not remove, they will probably notice, keep them in\r\nview as the ground work of future amendments, and in the firm and\r\nmanly language which every free people ought to use, will suggest to\r\nthose who may hereafter administer the government, that it is their\r\nexpectation, that the system will be so organized by legislative\r\nacts, and the government so administered, as to render those defects\r\nas little injurious as possible. Our countrymen are entitled to an\r\nhonest and faithful government; to a government of laws and not of\r\nmen; and also to one of their chusing—as a citizen of the country,\r\nI wish to see these objects secured, and licentious, assuming, and\r\noverbearing men restrained; if the constitution or social compact be\r\nvague and unguarded, then we depend wholly upon the prudence, wisdom\r\nand moderation of those who manage the affairs of government; or on\r\nwhat, probably, is equally uncertain and precarious, the success of the\r\npeople oppressed by the abuse of government, in receiving it from the\r\nhands of those who abuse it, and placing it in the hands of those who\r\nwill use it well.\r\n\r\nIn every point of view, therefore, in which I have been able, as yet,\r\nto contemplate this subject, I can discern but one rational mode of\r\nproceeding relative to it: and that is to examine it with freedom and\r\ncandour, to have state conventions some months hence, which shall\r\nexamine coolly every article, clause, and word in the system proposed,\r\nand to adopt it with such amendments as they shall think fit. How\r\nfar the state conventions ought to pursue the mode prescribed by the\r\nfederal convention of adopting or rejecting the plan in toto, I leave\r\nit to them to determine. Our examination of the subject hitherto has\r\nbeen rather of a general nature. The republican characters in the\r\nseveral states, who wish to make this plan more adequate to security of\r\nliberty and property, and to the duration of the principles of a free\r\ngovernment, will, no doubt, collect their opinions to certain points,\r\nand accurately define those [40] alterations and amendments they wish;\r\nif it shall be found they essentially disagree in them, the conventions\r\nwill then be able to determine whether to adopt the plan as it is, or\r\nwhat will be proper to be done.\r\n\r\nUnder these impressions, and keeping in view the improper and\r\nunadvisable lodgment of powers in the general government, organized\r\nas it at present is, touching internal taxes, armies and militia, the\r\nelections of its own members, causes between citizens of different\r\nstates, &c. and the want of a more perfect bill of rights, &c. I\r\ndrop the subject for the present, and when I shall have leisure\r\nto revise and correct my ideas respecting it, and to collect into\r\npoints the opinions of those who wish to make the system more secure\r\nand safe, perhaps I may proceed to point out particularly for your\r\nconsideration, the amendments which ought to be ingrafted into this\r\nsystem, not only in conformity to my own, but the deliberate opinions\r\nof others—you will with me perceive, that the objections to the plan\r\nproposed may, by a more leisure examination be set in a stronger point\r\nof view, especially the important one, that there is no substantial\r\nrepresentation of the people provided for in a government in which the\r\nmost essential powers, even as to the internal police of the country,\r\nis proposed to be lodged.\r\n\r\nI think the honest and substantial part of the community will wish\r\nto see this system altered, permanency and consistency given to the\r\nconstitution we shall adopt; and therefore they will be anxious\r\nto apportion the powers to the features and organizations of the\r\ngovernment, and to see abuse in the exercise of power more effectually\r\nguarded against. It is suggested, that state officers, from interested\r\nmotives will oppose the constitution presented——I see no reason for\r\nthis, their places in general will not be effected, but new openings to\r\noffices and places of profit must evidently be made by the adoption of\r\nthe constitution in its present form.\r\n\r\n  Your’s, &c.\r\n\r\n  THE FEDERAL FARMER.\r\n\r\n  _To the_ REPUBLICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Objections of the / Hon.

You will readily\r\n  observe, that my objections are not numerous (the greater part of the\r\n  enclosed paper containing reasonings upon the probable effects of\r\n  the exceptionable parts), though in my mind some of them are capital\r\n  ones.” Mason to Washington, October 7th, 1787.\r\n\r\n  Madison’s letter to Washington of October 18th, 1787, contains a\r\n  cursory answer to Mason’s “Objections,” and a more elaborate one by\r\n  James Iredell is printed in this volume.\r\n\r\n  P. L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no declaration of rights: and the laws of the general\r\ngovernment being paramount to the laws and constitutions of the several\r\nstates, the declarations of rights, in the separate states, are no\r\nsecurity. Nor are the people secured even in the enjoyment of the\r\nbenefit of the common law, which stands here upon no other foundation\r\nthan its having been adopted by the respective acts forming the\r\nconstitutions of the several states.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives there is not the substance, but\r\nthe shadow only of representation; which can never produce proper\r\ninformation in the legislature, or inspire confidence in the\r\npeople.—The laws will, therefore, be generally made by men little\r\nconcerned in, and unacquainted with their effects and consequences.(66)\r\n\r\nThe Senate have the power of altering all money-bills, and of\r\noriginating appropriations of money, and the salaries of the officers\r\nof their appointment, in conjunction with the President of the United\r\nStates—Although they are not the representatives of the people, or\r\namenable to them. These, with their other great powers, (viz. their\r\npowers in the appointment of ambassadors, and all public officers, in\r\nmaking treaties, and in trying all impeachments) their influence upon,\r\nand connection with, the supreme executive from these causes, their\r\nduration of office, and their being a constant existing body, almost\r\ncontinually sitting, joined with their being one complete branch of the\r\nlegislature, will destroy any balance in the government, and enable\r\nthem to accomplish what usurpations they please, upon the rights and\r\nliberties of the people.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary of the United States is so constructed and extended, as\r\nto absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the several states; thereby\r\nrendering laws as tedious, intricate, and expensive, and justice as\r\nunattainable by a great part of the community, as in England; and\r\nenabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States has no constitutional council (a\r\nthing unknown in any safe and regular government,) he will therefore\r\nbe unsupported by proper information and advice; and will generally\r\nbe directed by minions and favorites—or he will become a tool to\r\nthe Senate—or a council of state will grow out of the principal\r\nofficers of the great departments—the worst and most dangerous of\r\nall ingredients for such a council, in a free country; for they\r\nmay be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive measures, to\r\nshelter themselves, and prevent an inquiry into their own misconduct\r\nin office. Whereas, had a constitutional council been formed (as was\r\nproposed) of six members, viz., two from the eastern, two from the\r\nmiddle, and two from the southern states, to be appointed by vote of\r\nthe states in the House of Representatives, with the same duration\r\nand rotation of office as the Senate, the executive would always have\r\nhad safe and proper information and advice; the president of such a\r\ncouncil might have acted as Vice-President of the United States, _pro\r\ntempore_, upon any vacancy or disability of the chief magistrate; and\r\nlong continued sessions of the Senate, would in a great measure have\r\nbeen prevented. From this fatal defect of a constitutional council,\r\nhas arisen the improper power of the Senate, in the appointment of the\r\npublic officers, and the alarming dependence and connexion between\r\nthat branch of the legislature and the supreme executive. Hence, also,\r\nsprung that unnecessary officer, the Vice-President, who, for want of\r\nother employment, is made President of the Senate; thereby dangerously\r\nblending the executive and legislative powers; besides always giving to\r\nsome one of the states an unnecessary and unjust pre-eminence over the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States has the unrestrained power of\r\ngranting pardon for treason; which may be sometimes exercised to screen\r\nfrom punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the\r\ncrime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt. By declaring\r\nall treaties supreme laws of the land, the executive and the Senate\r\nhave, in many cases, an exclusive power of legislation, which might\r\nhave been avoided, by proper distinctions with respect to treaties, and\r\nrequiring the assent of the House of Representatives, where it could be\r\ndone with safety.\r\n\r\nBy requiring only a majority to make all commercial and navigation\r\nlaws, the five southern states (whose produce and circumstances are\r\ntotally different from those of the eight northern and eastern states)\r\nwill be ruined: for such rigid and premature regulations may be made,\r\nas will enable the merchants of the northern and eastern states not\r\nonly to demand an exorbitant freight, but to monopolize the purchase\r\nof the commodities, at their own price, for many years, to the great\r\ninjury of the landed interest, and the impoverishment of the people:\r\nand the danger is the greater, as the gain on one side will be in\r\nproportion to the loss on the other. Whereas, requiring two-thirds\r\nof the members present in both houses, would have produced mutual\r\nmoderation, promoted the general interest, and removed an insuperable\r\nobjection to the adoption of the government.\r\n\r\nUnder their own construction of the general clause at the end of\r\nthe enumerated powers, the Congress may grant monopolies in trade\r\nand commerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual and severe\r\npunishments, and extend their power as far as they shall think proper;\r\nso that the state legislatures have no security for the powers now\r\npresumed to remain to them; or the people for their rights. There is no\r\ndeclaration of any kind for preserving the liberty of the press, the\r\ntrial by jury in civil cases, nor against the danger of standing armies\r\nin time of peace.\r\n\r\nThe state legislatures are restrained from laying export duties\r\non their own produce—the general legislature is restrained from\r\nprohibiting the further importation of slaves for twenty odd years,\r\nthough such importations render the United States weaker, more\r\nvulnerable, and less capable of defence. Both the general legislature,\r\nand the state legislatures are expressly prohibited making _ex post\r\nfacto_ laws, though there never was, nor can be, a legislature, but\r\nmust and will make such laws, when necessity and the public safety\r\nrequire them, which will hereafter be a breach of all the constitutions\r\nin the union, and afford precedents for other innovations.\r\n\r\nThis government will commence in a moderate aristocracy; it is at\r\npresent impossible to foresee whether it will, in its operation,\r\nproduce a monarchy, or a corrupt oppressive aristocracy; it will most\r\nprobably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the\r\none or the other.\r\n\r\n  GEO. MASON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Answers to Mr. Mason’s objections to the new Constitution, recommended\r\nby the late Convention. By Marcus. Newbern: Printed by Hodge and Wills.\r\n1788.]\r\n\r\n  By James Iredell, member of the first North Carolina Convention.\r\n  This argument was originally published in the _State Gazette of\r\n  North Carolina_, and was republished in pamphlet form, together with\r\n  pieces by Archibald Maclaine and William R. Davie. The most careful\r\n  search has not enabled me to find the pamphlet, so I am forced to\r\n  reprint the “answers” from McRee’s _Life of James Iredell_, a work of\r\n  considerable rarity; and in consequence the above title is certainly\r\n  not that of the pamphlet.\r\n\r\n  “I have read with great pleasure your answer to Mr. Mason’s\r\n  objections; and surely every man who read them, and on whom Mr.\r\n  Mason’s observations, or indeed the arguments of those in opposition\r\n  in general have had any effect, must be convinced that the objections\r\n  to the constitution are without foundation.” _Witherspoon to Iredell,\r\n  April 3, 1788._\r\n\r\n  P. L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“There is no declaration of rights, and the laws of the general\r\ngovernment being paramount to the laws and constitutions of the\r\nseveral States, the declarations of rights in the separate States are\r\nno security. Nor are the people secured even in the enjoyment of the\r\nbenefit of the common law, which stands here upon no other foundation\r\nthan its having been adopted by the respective acts forming the\r\nConstitutions of the several States.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\n1. As to the want of a declaration of rights. The introduction of\r\nthese in England, from which the idea was originally taken, was in\r\nconsequence of usurpations of the Crown, contrary, as was conceived, to\r\nthe principles of their government. But there no original constitution\r\nis to be found, and the only meaning of a declaration of rights in\r\nthat country is, that in certain particulars specified, the Crown had\r\nno authority to act. Could this have been necessary had there been a\r\nconstitution in being by which it could have been clearly discerned\r\nwhether the Crown had such authority or not? Had the people, by a\r\nsolemn instrument, delegated particular powers to the Crown at the\r\nformation of their government, surely the Crown, which in that case\r\ncould claim under that instrument only, could not have contended for\r\nmore power than was conveyed by it. So it is in regard to the new\r\nConstitution here: the future government which may be formed under that\r\nauthority certainly cannot act beyond the warrant of that authority.\r\nAs well might they attempt to impose a King upon America, as go one\r\nstep in any other respect beyond the terms of their institution. The\r\nquestion then only is, whether more power will be vested in the future\r\ngovernment than is necessary for the general purposes of the union.\r\nThis may occasion a ground of dispute—but after expressly defining\r\nthe powers that are to be exercised, to say that they shall exercise\r\nno other powers (either by a general or particular enumeration) would\r\nseem to me both nugatory and ridiculous. As well might a Judge when he\r\ncondemns a man to be hanged, give strong injunctions to the Sheriff\r\nthat he should not be beheaded.(67)\r\n\r\n2. As to the common law, it is difficult to know what is meant by that\r\npart of the objection. So far as the people are now entitled to the\r\nbenefit of the common law, they certainly will have a right to enjoy it\r\nunder the new Constitution until altered by the general legislature,\r\nwhich even in this point has some cardinal limits assigned to it.\r\nWhat are most acts of Assembly but a deviation in some degree from\r\nthe principles of the common law? The people are expressly secured\r\n(contrary to Mr. Mason’s wishes) against _ex post facto_ laws; so that\r\nthe tenure of any property at any time held under the principles of\r\nthe common law, cannot be altered by any future act of the general\r\nlegislature. The principles of the common law, as they now apply,\r\nmust surely always hereafter apply, except in those particulars in\r\nwhich express authority is given by this constitution; in no other\r\nparticulars can the Congress have authority to change it, and I\r\nbelieve it cannot be shown that any one power of this kind given\r\nis unnecessarily given, or that the power would answer its proper\r\npurpose if the legislature was restricted from any innovations on the\r\nprinciples of the common law, which would not in all cases suit the\r\nvast variety of incidents that might arise out it.\r\n\r\nII. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“In the House of Representatives there is not the substance, but\r\nthe shadow only of representation; which can never produce proper\r\ninformation in the legislature, or inspire confidence in the people;\r\nthe laws will therefore generally be made by men little concerned in,\r\nand unacquainted with their effects and consequences.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nThis is a mere matter of calculation. It is said the weight of this\r\nobjection was in a great measure removed by altering the number of\r\n40,000 to 30,000 constituents. To show the discontented nature of man,\r\nsome have objected to the number of representatives as being too large.\r\nI leave to every man’s judgment whether the number is not sufficiently\r\nrespectable, and whether, if that number be sufficient, it would have\r\nbeen right, in the very infancy of this government, to burthen the\r\npeople with a great additional expense to answer no good purpose.(68)\r\n\r\nIII. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“The Senate have the power of altering all money bills, and of\r\noriginating appropriations of money, and the salaries of the officers\r\nof their own appointment, in conjunction with the President of the\r\nUnited States; although they are not the representatives of the people\r\nor amenable to them.—These, with their other great powers (viz. their\r\npowers in the appointment of Ambassadors, and all public officers,\r\nin making treaties and trying all impeachments) their influence upon\r\nand connection with the supreme Executive, from these causes, their\r\nduration of office, and their being a constant existing body almost\r\ncontinually sitting, joined with their being one complete branch of the\r\nlegislature, will destroy any balance in the government, and enable\r\nthem to accomplish what usurpations they please upon the rights and\r\nliberties of the people.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nThis objection, respecting the dangerous power of the Senate, is one\r\nof that kind which may give rise to a great deal of gloomy prediction,\r\nwithout any solid foundation: An imagination indulging itself in\r\nchimerical fears, upon the disappointment of a favorite plan, may\r\npoint out danger arising from any system of government whatever, even\r\nif angels were to have the administration of it; since I presume none\r\nbut the Supreme Being himself is altogether perfect, and of course\r\nevery other species of beings may abuse any delegated portion of power.\r\nThis sort of visionary scepticism therefore will lead us to this\r\nalternative, either to have no government at all, or to form the best\r\nsystem we can, making allowance for human imperfection. In my opinion\r\nthe fears as to the power of the Senate are altogether groundless, as\r\nto any probability of their being either able or willing to do any\r\nimportant mischief. My reasons are,\r\n\r\n1. Because, though they are not immediately to represent the people,\r\nyet they are to represent the representatives of the people who are\r\nannually chosen, and it is therefore probable the most popular, or\r\nconfidential, persons in each State, will be elected members of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n2. Because one-third of the Senate are to be chosen as often as the\r\nimmediate representatives of the people, and as the President can act\r\nin no case from which any great danger can be apprehended without the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds, let us think ever so ill of the designs\r\nof the President, and the danger of a combination of power among a\r\nstanding body generally associated with him, unless we suppose every\r\none of them to be base and infamous (a supposition, thank God, bad as\r\nhuman nature is, not within the verge of the slightest probability),\r\nwe have reason to believe that the one-third newly introduced every\r\nsecond year, will bring with them from the immediate body of the\r\npeople, a sufficient portion of patriotism and independence to check\r\nany exorbitant designs of the rest.\r\n\r\n3. Because in their legislative capacity they can do nothing without\r\nthe concurrence of the House of Representatives, and we need look no\r\nfarther than England for a clear proof of the amazing consequence which\r\nrepresentatives of the people bear in a free government. There the\r\nKing (who is hereditary, and therefore not so immediately interested,\r\naccording to narrow views of interest which commonly govern Kings, to\r\nconsult the welfare of his people) has the appointment to almost every\r\noffice in the government, many of which are of high dignity and great\r\npecuniary value, has the creation of as many Peers as he pleases, is\r\nnot restricted from bestowing places on the members of both houses of\r\nParliament, and has a direct negative on all bills, besides the power\r\nof dissolving the Parliament at his pleasure. In theory would not any\r\none say this power was enormous enough to destroy any balance in the\r\nconstitution? Yet what does the history of that country tell us?—that\r\nso great is the natural power of the House of Commons (though a very\r\nimperfect representation of the people, and a large proportion of them\r\nactually purchasing their seats) that ever since the revolution the\r\nCrown has continually aimed to corrupt them by the disposal of places\r\nand pensions; that without their hearty concurrence it found all the\r\nwheels of government perpetually clogged; and that notwithstanding\r\nthis, in great critical emergencies, the members have broke through the\r\ntrammels of power and interest, and by speaking the sense of the people\r\n(though so imperfectly representing them) either forced an alteration\r\nof measures, or made it necessary for the Crown to dissolve them.\r\nIf their power, under these circumstances, is so great, what would\r\nit be if their representation was perfect, and their members could\r\nhold no appointments, and at the same time had a security for their\r\nseats? The danger of a destruction of the balance would be perhaps on\r\nthe popular side, notwithstanding the hereditary tenure and weighty\r\nprerogatives of the Crown, and the permanent station and great wealth\r\nand consequence of the Lords. Our representatives therefore being\r\nan adequate and fair representation of the people, and they being\r\nexpressly excluded from the possession of any places, and not holding\r\ntheir existence upon any precarious tenure, must have vast influence,\r\nand considering that in every popular government the danger of faction\r\nis often very serious and alarming, if such a danger could not be\r\nchecked in its instant operation by some other power more independent\r\nof the immediate passions of the people, and capable therefore of\r\nthinking with more coolness, the government might be destroyed by a\r\nmomentary impulse of passion, which the very members who indulged it\r\nmight for ever afterwards in vain deplore. The institution of the\r\nSenate seems well calculated to answer this salutary purpose. Excluded\r\nas they are from places themselves, they appear to be as much above the\r\ndanger of personal temptation as men can be. They have no permanent\r\ninterest as a body to detach them from the general welfare, since six\r\nyears is the utmost period of their existence, unless their respective\r\nlegislatures are sufficiently pleased with their conduct to re-elect\r\nthem. This power of re-election is itself a great check upon abuse,\r\nbecause if they have ambition to continue members of the Senate they\r\ncan only gratify this ambition by acting agreeably to the opinion\r\nof their constituents. The House of Representatives, as immediately\r\nrepresenting the people, are to _originate_ all money bills. This I\r\nthink extremely right, and it is certainly a very capital acquisition\r\nto the popular representative. But what harm can arise from the Senate,\r\nwho are nearly a popular representative also, proposing amendments,\r\nwhen those amendments must be concurred with by the original proposers?\r\nThe wisdom of the Senate may sometimes point out amendments, the\r\npropriety of which the other House may be very sensible of, though\r\nthey had not occurred to themselves. There is no great danger of\r\nany body of men suffering by too eager an adoption of any amendment\r\nproposed to any system of their own. The probability is stronger of\r\ntheir being too tenacious of their original opinion, however erroneous,\r\nthan of their profiting by the wise information of any other persons\r\nwhatever. Human nature is so constituted, and therefore I think we\r\nmay safely confide in the free admission of an intercourse of opinion\r\non the detail of business, as well as to taxation as to other points.\r\nOur House of Representatives surely could not have such reason to\r\ndread the power of a Senate circumstanced as ours must be, as the\r\nHouse of Commons in England the permanent authority of the Peers, and\r\ntherefore a jealousy, which may be well grounded in the one case would\r\nbe entirely ill-directed in the other. For similar reasons I dread\r\nnot any power of originating appropriations of money as mentioned in\r\nthe objection. While the concurrence of the other House must be had,\r\nand as that must necessarily be the most weighty in the government, I\r\nthink no danger is to be apprehended. The Senate has no such authority\r\nas to awe or influence the House of Representatives, and it will be\r\nas necessary for the one as for the other that proper active measures\r\nshould be pursued: And in regard to appropriations of money, occasions\r\nfor such appropriations may, on account of their concurrence with the\r\nexecutive power, occur to the Senate, which would not to the House\r\nof Representatives, and therefore if the Senate were precluded from\r\nlaying any such proposals before the House of Representatives, the\r\ngovernment might be embarrassed; and it ought ever to be remembered,\r\nthat in our views of distant and chimerical dangers we ought not to\r\nhazard our very existence as a people, by proposing such restrictions\r\nas may prevent the exertion of any necessary power. The power of\r\nthe Senate in the appointment of Ambassadors, &c., is designed as a\r\ncheck upon the President. They must be appointed in some manner. If\r\nthe appointment was by the President alone, or by the President and\r\na _Privy_ Council (Mr. Mason’s favorite plan), an objection to such\r\na system would have appeared much more plausible. It would have been\r\nsaid that this was approaching too much towards monarchical power,\r\nand if this new Privy Council had been like all I have ever heard of,\r\nit would have afforded little security against an abuse of power in\r\nthe President. It ought to be shown by reason and probability (not\r\nbold assertion) how this concurrence of power with the President can\r\nmake the Senate so dangerous. It is as good an argument to say that\r\nit will not as that it will.(69) The power of making treaties is\r\nso important that it would have been highly dangerous to vest it in\r\nthe Executive alone, and would have been the subject of much greater\r\nclamor. From the nature of the thing, it could not be vested in the\r\npopular representative. It must therefore have been provided for with\r\nthe Senate’s concurrence, or the concurrence of a Privy Council (a\r\nthing which I believe nobody has been mad enough to propose), or the\r\npower, the greatest monarchical power that can be exercised, must have\r\nbeen vested in a manner that would have excited universal indignation\r\nin the President alone.—As to the power of trying impeachments:—Let\r\nMr. Mason show where this power could more properly have been placed.\r\nIt is a necessary power in every free government, since even the Judges\r\nof the Supreme Court of Judicature themselves may require a trial, and\r\nother public officers might have too much influence before an ordinary\r\nand common court. And what probability is there that such a court,\r\nacting in so solemn a manner, should abuse its power (especially as it\r\nis wisely provided that the sentences shall extend only to removal from\r\noffice and incapacitation) more than any other court? The argument as\r\nto the possible abuse of power, as I have before suggested, will reach\r\nall delegation of power, since all power may be abused when fallible\r\nbeings are to execute it; but we must take as much caution as we can,\r\nbeing careful at the same time not to be too wise to do any thing\r\nat all.—The bold assertions at the end of this objection are mere\r\ndeclamation, and till some reason is assigned for them, I shall take\r\nthe liberty to rely upon the reasons I have stated above, as affording\r\na belief that the popular representative must for ever be the most\r\nweighty in this government, and of course that apprehensions of danger\r\nfrom such a Senate are altogether ill-founded.\r\n\r\nIV. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“The judiciary of the United States is so constructed and extended,\r\nas to absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the several States;\r\nthereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and expensive and justice\r\nas unattainable by a great part of the community, as in England; and\r\nenabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason has here asserted, “That the judiciary of the United\r\nStates is so constructed and extended, as to absorb and destroy the\r\njudiciaries of the several States.” How is this the case? Are not\r\nthe State judiciaries left uncontrolled as to the affairs of that\r\n_State_ only? In this, as in all other cases, where there is a wise\r\ndistribution, power is commensurate to its object. With the mere\r\ninternal concerns of a State, Congress are to have nothing to do: In\r\nno case but where the Union is in some measure concerned, are the\r\nfederal courts to have any jurisdiction. The State Judiciary will be a\r\nsatellite waiting upon its proper planet: That of the Union, like the\r\nsun, cherishing and preserving a whole planetary system.\r\n\r\nIn regard to a possible ill construction of this authority, we must\r\ndepend upon our future legislature in this case as well as others, in\r\nrespect to which it is impracticable to define every thing, that it\r\nwill be provided for so as to occasion as little expense and distress\r\nto individuals as can be. _In parting with the coercive authority\r\nover the States as States, there must be a coercion allowed as to\r\nindividuals. The former power no man of common sense can any longer\r\nseriously contend for; the latter is the only alternative._ Suppose\r\nan objection should be made that the future legislature should not\r\nascertain salaries, because they might divide among themselves and\r\ntheir officers all the revenue of the Union.(70) Will not every man see\r\nhow irrational it is to expect that any government can exist which is\r\nto be fettered in its most necessary operations for fear of abuse?\r\n\r\nV. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“The President of the United States has no constitutional Council (a\r\nthing unknown in any safe and regular government), he will therefore\r\nbe unsupported by proper information and advice, and will generally\r\nbe directed by minions and favorites—or he will become a tool to\r\nthe Senate—or a Council of State will grow out of the principal\r\nofficers of the great departments; the worst and most dangerous of\r\nall ingredients for such a Council in a free country, for they may be\r\ninduced to join in any dangerous or oppressive measures, to shelter\r\nthemselves, and prevent an inquiry into their own misconduct in office:\r\nWhereas, had a constitutional Council been formed (as was proposed)\r\nof six members, viz., two from the eastern, two from the middle, and\r\ntwo from the southern States, to be appointed by a vote of the States\r\nin the House of Representatives, with the same duration and rotation\r\nof office as the Senate, the Executive would always have had safe and\r\nproper information and advice: The President of such a Council might\r\nhave acted as Vice-President of the United States, _pro tempore_, upon\r\nany vacancy or disability of the Chief Magistrate, and long-continued\r\nsessions of the Senate would in a great measure have been prevented.\r\nFrom this fatal defect of a constitutional Council has arisen the\r\nimproper power of the Senate, in the appointment of public officers,\r\nand the alarming dependence and connection between that branch of\r\nthe legislature and the Supreme Executive. Hence also sprung that\r\nunnecessary and dangerous officer, the Vice-President, who for want of\r\nother employment, is made President of the Senate; thereby dangerously\r\nblending the Executive and Legislative powers; besides always giving to\r\nsome one of the States an unnecessary and unjust pre-eminence over the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason here reprobates the omission of a particular Council for\r\nthe President, as a thing contrary to the example of all safe and\r\nregular governments. Perhaps there are very few governments now in\r\nbeing deserving of that character, if under the idea of safety he means\r\nto include safety for a proper share of personal freedom, without\r\nwhich their safety and regularity in other respects would be of little\r\nconsequence to a people so justly jealous of liberty as I hope the\r\npeople in America ever will be. Since however Mr. Mason refers us to\r\nsuch authority, I think I cannot do better than to select for the\r\nsubject of our inquiry in this particular, a government which must\r\nbe universally acknowledged to be the most safe and regular of any\r\nconsiderable government now in being (though I hope America will soon\r\nbe able to dispute that pre-eminence). Every body must know I speak\r\nof Great Britain, and in this I think I give Mr. Mason all possible\r\nadvantage, since in my opinion it is most probable he had Great\r\nBritain principally in his eye when he made this remark, and in the\r\nvery height of our quarrel with that country, so wedded were our ideas\r\nto the institution of a Council, that the practice was generally if\r\nnot universally followed at the formation of our governments, though\r\nwe instituted Councils of a quite different nature, and so far as\r\nthe little experience of the writer goes, have very little benefited\r\nby it. My inquiry into this subject shall not be confined to the\r\nactual present practice of Great Britain; I shall take the liberty\r\nto state the Constitutional ideas of Councils in England, as derived\r\nfrom their ancient law subsisting long before the Union, not omitting\r\nhowever to show what the present practice really is. By the laws of\r\nEngland(71) the King is said to have four Councils,—1, The High Court\r\nof Parliament; 2, The Peers of the realm; 3, His Judges; 4, His Privy\r\nCouncil. By the first, I presume is meant, in regard to the making\r\nof laws; because the usual introductory expressions in most acts\r\nof Parliament, viz., “By the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and\r\nCommons,” &c., show that in a constitutional sense, they are deemed the\r\nKing’s laws, after a ratification in Parliament. The Peers of the realm\r\nare by their birth hereditary Counsellors of the Crown, and may be\r\ncalled upon for their advice, either in time of Parliament, or when\r\nno Parliament is in being: They are called in some law books _Magnum\r\nConcilium Regis_ (the King’s Great Council). It is also considered the\r\nprivilege of every particular Peer to demand an audience of the King,\r\nand to lay before him anything he may deem of public importance. The\r\nJudges, I presume, are called “Council of the King,” upon the same\r\nprinciple as the Parliament is, because the administration of justice\r\nis in his name, and the Judges are considered as his instruments in\r\nthe distribution of it. We come now to the Privy Council, which I\r\nimagine, if Mr. Mason had any particular view towards England when\r\nhe made this objection, was the one he intended as an example of a\r\n_Constitutional Council_ in that kingdom. The Privy Council in that\r\ncountry is undoubtedly of very ancient institution, but it has one\r\nfixed property invariably annexed to it, that it is a mere creature\r\nof the Crown, dependent on its will both for number and duration,\r\nsince the King may, whenever he thinks proper, discharge any member,\r\nor the whole of it, and appoint another.(72) If this precedent is of\r\nmoment to us, merely as a precedent, it should be followed in all its\r\nparts, and then what would there be in the regulation to prevent the\r\nPresident being governed by “minions and favorites?” It would only be\r\nthe means of riveting them on constitutional ground. So far as the\r\nprecedents in England apply, the Peers being constitutionally the\r\n_Great Council_ of the King, though also a part of the legislature, we\r\nhave reason to hope that there is by no means such a gross impropriety\r\nas has been suggested in giving the Senate, though a branch of the\r\nlegislature, a strong control over the Executive. The only difference\r\nin the two cases is, that the Crown in England may or may not give\r\nthis consequence to the Peers at its own pleasure, and accordingly\r\nwe find that for a long time past this great Council has been very\r\nseldom consulted; under our constitution the President is allowed no\r\noption in respect to certain points wherein he cannot act without the\r\nSenate’s concurrence. But we cannot infer from any example in England,\r\nthat a concurrence between the Executive and a part of the legislative\r\nis contrary to the maxims of their government, since their government\r\nallows of such a concurrence whenever the Executive pleases. The rule,\r\ntherefore, from the example of the freest government in Europe, that\r\nthe Legislative and Executive powers must be altogether distinct,\r\nis liable to exceptions; it does not mean that the Executive shall\r\nnot form a part of the Legislative (for the King, who has the whole\r\nExecutive authority, is one entire branch of the legislature, and\r\nthis Montesquieu, who recognizes the general principle, declares is\r\nnecessary); neither can it mean (as the example above evinces) that the\r\nCrown must consult neither House as to any exercise of the Executive\r\npower. But its meaning must be, that one power shall not include _both\r\nauthorities_. The King, for instance, shall not have the sole Executive\r\nand sole Legislative authority also. He may have the former, but must\r\nparticipate the latter with the two Houses of Parliament. The rule\r\nalso would be infringed were the three branches of the legislature\r\nto share jointly the Executive power. But so long as the people’s\r\nrepresentatives are altogether distinct from the Executive authority,\r\nthe liberties of the people may be deemed secure. And in this point\r\nsurely, there can be no manner of comparison between the provisions by\r\nwhich the independence of our House of Representatives is guarded, and\r\nthe condition in which the British House of Commons is left exposed to\r\nevery species of corruption. But Mr. Mason says, for want of a Council,\r\nthe President may become “a tool of the Senate.” Why? Because he cannot\r\nact without their concurrence. Would not the same reason hold for\r\nhis being “a tool to the Council,” if he could not act without their\r\nconcurrence, supposing a Council was to be imposed upon him without his\r\nown nomination (according to Mr. Mason’s plan)? As great care is taken\r\nto make him independent of the Senate as I believe human precaution\r\ncan provide. Whether the President will be a tool to any persons will\r\ndepend upon the man, and the same weakness of mind which would make\r\nhim pliable to one body of control, would certainly attend him with\r\nanother. But Mr. Mason objects, if he is not directed by minions and\r\nfavorites, nor becomes a tool of the Senate, “a Council of State will\r\ngrow out of the principal officers of the great departments; the worst\r\nand most dangerous of all ingredients for such a Council in a free\r\ncountry; for they may be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive\r\nmeasures, to shelter themselves, and prevent an inquiry into their\r\nown misconduct in office.” I beg leave to carry him again to my old\r\nauthority, England, and ask him, what efficient Council they have there\r\nbut one formed of their great officers. Notwithstanding their important\r\n_Constitutional Council_, everybody knows that the whole movements of\r\ntheir Government, where a Council is consulted at all, are directed by\r\ntheir _Cabinet Council_, composed entirely of the principal officers\r\nof the great departments; that when a Privy Council is called, it is\r\nscarcely ever for any other purpose than to give a formal sanction\r\nto the previous determinations of the other, so much so that it is\r\nnotorious that not one time in a thousand one member of the Privy\r\nCouncil, except a known adherent of administration, is summoned to it.\r\nBut though the President under our constitution may have the aid of\r\nthe “principal officers of the great departments,” he is to have this\r\naid, I think, in the most unexceptionable manner possible. He is not\r\nto be assisted by a Council summoned to a jovial dinner perhaps, and\r\ngiving their opinions according to the nod of the President; but the\r\nopinion is to be given with the utmost solemnity _in writing_. No after\r\nequivocation can explain it away. It must for ever afterwards speak\r\nfor itself, and commit the character of the writer, in lasting colors,\r\neither of fame or infamy, or neutral insignificance, to future ages, as\r\nwell as the present. From those _written reasons_, weighed with care,\r\nsurely the President can form as good a judgment, as if they had been\r\ngiven by a dozen formal characters, carelessly met together on a slight\r\nappointment; and this further advantage would be derived from the\r\nproposed system (which would be wanting if he had constitutional advice\r\nto screen him), that the President must be _personally responsible_\r\nfor everything—for though an ingenious gentleman has proposed, that\r\na Council should be responsible for _their opinions_, and the same\r\nsentiment of justice might be applied to these opinions of the great\r\nofficers, I am persuaded it will in general be thought infinitely more\r\n_safe_, as well as more _just_, that the President who _acts_ should\r\nbe responsible for his _conduct_, following advice at his peril, than\r\nthat there should be a danger of punishing any man for an erroneous\r\nopinion which might possibly be sincere. Besides the morality of this\r\nscheme, which may well be questioned, its inexpediency is glaring,\r\nsince it would be so plausible an excuse and the insincerity of it\r\nso difficult to detect, the hopes of impunity this avenue to escape\r\nwould afford would nearly take away all dread of punishment. As to the\r\ntemptation mentioned to the officers joining in dangerous or oppressive\r\nmeasures to shelter themselves, and prevent an inquiry into their\r\nown misconduct in office, this proceeds upon a supposition that the\r\nPresident and the great officers may form a very wicked combination\r\nto injure their country, a combination that in the first place it\r\nis utterly improbable, in a strong respectable government should be\r\nformed for that purpose, and in the next, with such a government as\r\nthis constitution would give us, could have little chance of being\r\nsuccessful, on account of the great superior strength and natural and\r\njealous vigilance of one at least, if not both the weighty branches\r\nof legislation. This evil, however, of the possible depravity of _all\r\npublic officers_, is one that can admit of no cure, since in every\r\ninstitution of government the same danger in some degree or other must\r\nbe risked; it can only be guarded against by strong checks, and I\r\nbelieve it be difficult for the objectors to our new Constitution to\r\nprovide stronger ones against any abuse of the Executive authority than\r\nwill exist in that. As to the Vice President, it appears to me very\r\nproper he should be chosen much in the same manner as the President,\r\nin order that the States may be secure, upon any accidental loss by\r\ndeath or otherwise of the President’s service, of the services in the\r\nsame important station of the man in whom they repose their second\r\nconfidence. The complicated manner of election wisely prescribed would\r\nnecessarily occasion a considerable delay in the choice of another,\r\nand in the mean time the President of the Council, though very fit for\r\nthe purpose of advising, might be very ill qualified, especially in a\r\ncritical period, for an active Executive department. I am concerned\r\nto see, among Mr. Mason’s other reasons, so trivial a one as the\r\nlittle advantage one State might accidentally gain by a Vice President\r\nof their country having a seat, with merely a casting vote, in the\r\nSenate. Such a reason is utterly unworthy of that spirit of amity, and\r\nrejection of local views, which can alone save us from destruction.\r\nIt was the glory of the late Convention, that by discarding such they\r\nformed a general government upon principles that did as much honor to\r\ntheir hearts as to their understandings. God grant, that in all our\r\ndeliberations, we may consider America as _one_ body, and not divert\r\nour attention from so able a prospect to small considerations of\r\npartial jealousy and distrust. It is in vain to expect upon any system\r\nto secure an exact equilibrium of power for all the States. Some will\r\noccasionally have an advantage from the superior abilities of its\r\nmembers; the field of emulation is however open to all. Suppose any\r\none should now object to the superior influence of Virginia (and the\r\nwriter of this is not a citizen of that State), on account of the high\r\ncharacter of General Washington, confessedly the greatest man of the\r\npresent age, and perhaps equal to any that has existed in any period of\r\ntime; would this be a reason for refusing a union with her, though the\r\nother States can scarcely hope for the consolation of ever producing\r\nhis equal?\r\n\r\nVI. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“The President of the United States has the unrestrained power of\r\ngranting pardons for treason; which may be sometimes exercised to\r\nscreen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit\r\nthe crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nNobody can contend upon any rational principles, that a power of\r\npardoning should not exist somewhere in every government, because it\r\nwill often happen in every country that men are obnoxious to a lawful\r\nconviction, who yet are entitled, from some favorable circumstances in\r\ntheir case, to a merciful interposition in their favor. The advocates\r\nof monarchy have accordingly boasted of this, as one of the advantages\r\nof that form of government, in preference to a republican; nevertheless\r\nthis authority is vested in the Stadtholder in Holland, and I believe\r\nis vested in every Executive power in America. It seems to have been\r\nwisely the aim of the late Convention, in forming a general government\r\nfor America, to combine the acknowledged advantages of the British\r\nconstitution with proper republican checks to guard as much as possible\r\nagainst abuses, and it would have been very strange if they had omitted\r\nthis, which has the sanction of such great antiquity in that country,\r\nand if I am not mistaken, a universal adoption in America.(73) Those\r\ngentlemen who object to other parts of the constitution as introducing\r\ninnovations, contrary to long experience, with a very ill grace attempt\r\nto reject an experience so unexceptionable as this, to introduce an\r\ninnovation (perhaps the first ever suggested) of their own. When a\r\npower is acknowledged to be necessary, it is a very dangerous thing\r\nto prescribe limits to it, for men must have a greater confidence in\r\ntheir own wisdom than I think any men are entitled to, who imagine\r\nthey can form such exact ideas of all possible contingencies as to\r\nbe sure that the restriction they propose will not do more harm than\r\ngood. The probability of the President of the United States committing\r\nan act of treason against his country is very slight; he is so well\r\nguarded by the other powers of government, and the natural strength\r\nof the people at large must be so weighty, that in my opinion it is\r\nthe most chimerical apprehension that can be entertained. Such a\r\nthing is however possible, and accordingly he is not exempt from a\r\ntrial, if he should be guilty or supposed guilty, of that or any other\r\noffence. I entirely lay out of the consideration of the probability of\r\na man honored in such a manner by his country, risking like General\r\nArnold, the damnation of his fame to all future ages, though it is a\r\ncircumstance of some weight in considering whether for the sake of such\r\na remote and improbable danger as this, it would be prudent to abridge\r\nthis power of pardoning in a manner altogether unexampled, and which\r\nmight produce mischiefs the full extent of which it is not perhaps\r\neasy at present to foresee. In estimating the value of any power it is\r\npossible to bestow we have to choose between inconveniences of some\r\nsort or other, since no institution of man can be entirely free from\r\nall. Let us now therefore consider some of the actual inconveniences\r\nwhich would attend an abridgment of the power of the President in this\r\nrespect. One of the great advantages attending a single Executive power\r\nis the degree of secrecy and dispatch with which on critical occasions\r\nsuch a power can act. In war this advantage will often counterbalance\r\nthe want of many others. Now suppose, in the very midst of a war of\r\nextreme consequence to our safety or prosperity, the President could\r\nprevail on a gentleman of abilities to go into the enemy’s country,\r\nto serve in the useful, but dishonorable character of a spy. Such are\r\ncertainly maintained by all vigilant governments, and in proportion\r\nto the ignominy of the character, and the danger sustained in the\r\nenemy’s country, ought to be his protection and security in his own.\r\nThis man renders very useful services; perhaps by timely information,\r\nprevents the destruction of his country. Nobody knows of these secret\r\nservices but the President himself; his adherence however to the enemy\r\nis notorious: he is afterwards intercepted in endeavoring to return to\r\nhis own country, and having been perhaps a man of distinction before,\r\nhe is proportionably obnoxious to his country at large for his supposed\r\ntreason. Would it not be monstrous that the President should not have\r\nit in his power to pardon this man? or that it should depend upon mere\r\nsolicitation and favor, and perhaps, though the President should state\r\nthe fact as it really was, some zealous partisan, with his jealousy\r\nconstantly fixed upon the President, might insinuate that in fact the\r\nPresident and he were secret traitors together, and thus obtain a\r\nrejection of the President’s application. It is a consideration also\r\nof some moment, that there is scarcely any accusation more apt to\r\nexcite popular prejudice than the charge of treason. There is perhaps\r\nno country in the world where justice is in general more impartially\r\nadministered than in England, yet let any man read some of the trials\r\nfor treason in that country even since the revolution; he will see\r\nsometimes a fury influencing the judges, as well as the jury, that is\r\nextremely disgraceful. There may happen a case in our country where\r\na man in reality innocent, but with strong plausible circumstances\r\nagainst him, would be so obnoxious to popular resentment, that he might\r\nbe convicted upon very slight and insufficient proof. In such a case\r\nit would certainly be very proper for a cool temperate man of high\r\nauthority, and who might be supposed uninfluenced by private motives,\r\nto interfere and prevent the popular current proving an innocent man’s\r\nruin. I know men who write with a view to flatter the people, and\r\nnot to give them honest information, may misrepresent this account\r\nas an invidious imputation on the usual impartiality of juries. God\r\nknows no man more highly reverences that blessed institution than I\r\ndo; I consider them the natural safeguard of the personal liberties\r\nof a free people, and I believe they would much seldomer err in the\r\nadministration of justice than any other tribunal whatever. But no man\r\nof experience and candor will deny the probability of such a case\r\nas I have supposed sometimes, though rarely, happening; and whenever\r\nit did happen, surely so safe a remedy as a prerogative of mercy in\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of a great country ought to be at hand. There\r\nis little danger of an abuse of such a power, when we know how apt\r\nmost men are in a republican government to court popularity at too\r\ngreat an expense, rather than do a just and beneficient action in\r\nopposition to strong prevailing prejudices among the people. But says\r\nMr. Mason, “The President may sometimes exercise this power to screen\r\nfrom punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the\r\ncrime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt.” This is\r\npossible, but the probability of it is surely too slight to endanger\r\nthe consequences of abridging a power which seems so generally to have\r\nbeen deemed necessary in every well regulated government. It may also\r\nbe questioned, whether supposing such a participation of guilt, the\r\nPresident would not expose himself to greater danger by pardoning,\r\nthan by suffering the law to have its course. Was it not supposed, by\r\na great number of intelligent men, that Admiral Byng’s execution was\r\nurged on to satisfy a discontented populace, when the administration,\r\nby the weakness of the force he was entrusted with, were perhaps the\r\nreal cause of the miscarriage before Minorca? Had he been acquitted, or\r\npardoned, he could have perhaps exposed the real fault: as a prisoner\r\nunder so heavy a charge his recrimination would have been discredited,\r\nas merely the effort of a man in despair to save himself from an\r\nignominious punishment. If a President should pardon an accomplice,\r\nthat accomplice then would be an unexceptionable witness. Before,\r\nhe would be a witness with a rope about his own neck, struggling to\r\nget clear of it at all events. Would any men of understanding, or at\r\nleast ought they to credit an accusation from a person under such\r\ncircumstances?(74)\r\n\r\nVII. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“By declaring all treaties the supreme law of the land, the Executive\r\nand the Senate have, in many cases an exclusive power of legislation;\r\nwhich might have been avoided by proper distinctions with respect to\r\ntreaties, and requiring the assent of the House of Representatives,\r\nwhere it could be done with safety.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nDid not Congress very lately unanimously resolve, in adopting the very\r\nsensible letter of Mr. Jay, that a treaty when once made pursuant to\r\nthe sovereign authority, _ex vi termini_ became immediately the law of\r\nthe land? It seems to result unavoidably from the nature of the thing,\r\nthat when the constitutional right to make treaties is exercised, the\r\ntreaty so made should be binding upon those who delegated authority\r\nfor that purpose. If it was not, what foreign power would trust us?\r\nAnd if this right was restricted by any such fine checks as Mr. Mason\r\nhas in his imagination, but has not thought proper to disclose, a\r\ncritical occasion might arise, when for want of a little rational\r\nconfidence in our own government we might be obliged to submit to a\r\nmaster in an enemy. Mr. Mason wishes the House of Representatives to\r\nhave some share in this business, but he is immediately sensible of\r\nthe impropriety of it, and adds “where it can be done with safety.”\r\nAnd how is it to be known whether it can be done with safety or not,\r\nbut during the pendency of a negotiation? Must not the President and\r\nSenate judge whether it can be done with safety or not? If they are of\r\nopinion it is unsafe, and the House of Representatives of course not\r\nconsulted, what becomes of this boasted check, since, if it amounts\r\nto no more than that the President and Senate may consult the House\r\nof Representatives if they please, they may do this as well without\r\nsuch a provision as with it. Nothing would be more easy than to assign\r\nplausible reasons, after the negotiation was over, to show that a\r\ncommunication was unsafe, and therefore surely a precaution that could\r\nbe so easily eluded, if it was not impolitic to the greatest degree,\r\nmust be thought trifling indeed. It is also to be observed, that this\r\nauthority, so obnoxious in the new Constitution (which is unfortunate\r\nin having little power to please some persons, either as containing\r\nnew things or old), is vested indefinitely and without restriction in\r\nour present Congress, who are a body constituted in the same manner as\r\nthe Senate is to be, but there is this material difference in the two\r\ncases, that we shall have an additional check, under the new system of\r\na President of high personal character chosen by the immediate body of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nVIII. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“Under their own construction of the general clause at the end of the\r\nenumerated powers, the Congress may grant monopolies in trade and\r\ncommerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual and severe punishment,\r\nand extend their power as far as they shall think proper; so that the\r\nState Legislatures have no security for the powers now presumed to\r\nremain to them: or the people for their rights. There is no declaration\r\nof any kind for preserving the liberty of the press, the trial by jury\r\nin civil causes, nor against the danger of standing armies in time of\r\npeace.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nThe general clause at the end of the enumerated power is as follows:—\r\n\r\n“To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution the _foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by\r\nthis Constitution in the United States, or in any department or office\r\nthereof_.”\r\n\r\nThose powers would be useless, except acts of legislation could be\r\nexercised upon them. It was not possible for the Convention, nor is it\r\nfor any human body, to foresee and provide for all contingent cases\r\nthat may arise. Such cases must therefore be left to be provided for by\r\nthe general Legislature as they shall happen to come into existence.\r\nIf Congress, under pretence of exercising the power delegated to them,\r\nshould in fact, by the exercise of any other power, usurp upon the\r\nrights of the different Legislatures, or of any private citizens, the\r\npeople will be exactly in the same situation as if there had been an\r\nexpress provision against such power in particular, and yet they had\r\npresumed to exercise it. It would be an act of tyranny, against which\r\nno parchment stipulations can guard; and the Convention surely can be\r\nonly answerable for the propriety of the powers given, not for the\r\nfuture virtues of all with whom those powers may be intrusted. It does\r\nnot therefore appear to me that there is any weight in this objection\r\nmore than in others. But that I may give it every fair advantage, I\r\nwill take notice of every particular injurious act of power which Mr.\r\nMason points out as exercisable by the authority of Congress under this\r\ngeneral clause.\r\n\r\nThe first mentioned is, “That the Congress may grant monopolies\r\nin trade and commerce.” Upon examining the constitution I find it\r\nexpressly provided, “That no preference shall be given to the ports\r\nof one State over those of another;” and that “citizens of each State\r\nshall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the\r\nseveral States.” These provisions appear to me to be calculated for the\r\nvery purpose Mr. Mason wishes to secure. Can they be consistent with\r\nany monopoly in trade and commerce?(75) I apprehend therefore, under\r\nthis expression must be intended more than is expressed, and if I may\r\nconjecture from another publication of a gentleman of the same State\r\nand in the same party of opposition, I should suppose it arose from a\r\njealousy of the eastern States very well known to be often expressed by\r\nsome gentlemen of Virginia. They fear, that a majority of the States\r\nmay establish regulations of commerce which will give great advantage\r\nto the carrying trade of America, and be a means of encouraging New\r\nEngland vessels rather than Old England. Be it so. No regulations can\r\ngive such advantage to New England vessels, which will not be enjoyed\r\nby all other American vessels, and many States can build as well as\r\nNew England, though not at present perhaps in equal proportion.(76) And\r\nwhat could conduce more to the preservation of the Union than allowing\r\nto every kind of industry in America a peculiar preference! Each State\r\nexerting itself in its own way, but the exertions of all contributing\r\nto the common security, and increasing the rising greatness of our\r\ncountry! Is it not the aim of every wise country to be as much the\r\ncarriers of their own produce as they can be? And would not this be\r\nthe means in our own of producing a new source of activity among the\r\npeople, giving to our fellow-citizens what otherwise must be given to\r\nstrangers, and laying the foundation of an independent trade among\r\nourselves, and of gradually raising a navy in America which, however\r\ndistant the prospect, ought certainly not to be out of our sight.\r\nThere is no great probability however that our country is likely soon\r\nto enjoy so glorious an advantage. We must have treaties of commerce,\r\nbecause without them we cannot trade to other countries. We already\r\nhave such with some nations; we have none with Great Britain, which can\r\nbe imputed to no other cause but our not having a strong respectable\r\ngovernment to bring that haughty nation to terms. And surely no man,\r\nwho feels for the honor of his country, but must view our present\r\ndegrading commerce with that country with the highest indignation,\r\nand the most ardent wish to extricate ourselves from so disgraceful a\r\nsituation. This only can be done by a powerful government which can\r\ndictate conditions of advantage to ourselves, as an equivalent for\r\nadvantages to them; and this could undoubtedly be easily done by such\r\na government, without diminishing the value of any articles of our own\r\nproduce; or if there was any diminution it would be too slight to be\r\nfelt by any patriot in competition with the honor and interest of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs to the constituting of new crimes, and inflicting unusual and severe\r\npunishment, certainly the cases enumerated wherein the Congress are\r\nempowered either to define offences, or prescribe punishments, are\r\nsuch as are proper for the exercise of such authority in the general\r\nLegislature of the Union. They only relate to “counterfeiting the\r\nsecurities and current coin of the United States,” to “piracies and\r\nfelonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law\r\nof nations,” and to “treason against the United States.” These are\r\noffences immediately affecting the security, the honor or the interest\r\nof the United States at large, and of course must come within the\r\nsphere of the Legislative authority which is intrusted with their\r\nprotection. Beyond these authorities, Congress can exercise no other\r\npower of this kind, except in the enacting of penalties to enforce\r\ntheir acts of legislation in the cases where express authority is\r\ndelegated to them, and if they could not enforce such acts by the\r\nenacting of penalties those powers would be altogether useless, since\r\na legislative regulation without some sanction would be an absurd\r\nthing indeed. The Congress having, for these reasons, a just right to\r\nauthority in the above particulars, the question is, whether it is\r\npracticable and proper to prescribe limits to its exercise, for fear\r\nthat they should inflict punishments unusual and severe. It may be\r\nobserved, in the first place, that a declaration against “cruel and\r\nunusual punishments” formed part of an article in the Bill of Rights at\r\nthe revolution in England in 1688. The prerogative of the Crown having\r\nbeen grossly abused in some preceding reigns, it was thought proper to\r\nnotice every grievance they had endured, and those declarations went\r\nto an abuse of power in the Crown only, but were never intended to\r\nlimit the authority of Parliament. Many of these articles of the Bill\r\nof Rights in England, without a due attention to the difference of the\r\ncases, were eagerly adopted when our constitutions were formed, the\r\nminds of men then being so warmed with their exertions in the cause\r\nof liberty as to lean too much perhaps towards a jealousy of power\r\nto repose a proper confidence in their own government. From these\r\narticles in the State constitutions many things were attempted to be\r\ntransplanted into our new Constitution, which would either have been\r\nnugatory or improper. This is one of them. The expressions “unusual\r\nand severe” or “cruel and unusual” surely would have been too vague to\r\nhave been of any consequence, since they admit of no clear and precise\r\nsignification. If to guard against punishments being too severe, the\r\nConvention had enumerated a vast variety of cruel punishments, and\r\nprohibited the use of any of them, let the number have been ever so\r\ngreat, an inexhaustible fund must have been unmentioned, and if our\r\ngovernment had been disposed to be cruel their invention would only\r\nhave been put to a little more trouble. If to avoid this difficulty,\r\nthey had determined, not negatively what punishments should not be\r\nexercised, but positively what punishments should, this must have led\r\nthem into a labyrinth of detail which in the original constitution of\r\na government would have appeared perfectly ridiculous, and not left a\r\nroom for such changes, according to circumstances, as must be in the\r\npower of every Legislature that is rationally formed. Thus when we\r\nenter into particulars, we must be convinced that the proposition of\r\nsuch a restriction would have led to nothing useful, or to something\r\ndangerous, and therefore that its omission is not chargeable as a fault\r\nin the new Constitution. Let us also remember, that as those who are to\r\nmake those laws must themselves be subject to them, their own interest\r\nand feelings will dictate to them not to make them unnecessarily\r\nsevere; and that in the case of treason, which usually in every country\r\nexposes men most to the avarice and rapacity of government, care is\r\ntaken that the innocent family of the offender shall not suffer for\r\nthe treason of their relation. This is the crime with respect to which\r\na jealousy is of the most importance, and accordingly it is defined\r\nwith great plainness and accuracy, and the temptations to abusive\r\nprosecutions guarded against as much as possible. I now proceed to the\r\nthree great cases: The liberty of the press, the trial by jury in civil\r\ncases, and a standing army in time of peace.\r\n\r\nThe liberty of the press is always a grand topic for declamation,\r\nbut the future Congress will have no other authority over this than\r\nto secure to authors for a limited time an exclusive privilege of\r\npublishing their works.—This authority has been long exercised in\r\nEngland, where the press is as free as among ourselves or in any\r\ncountry in the world; and surely such an encouragement to genius is\r\nno restraint on the liberty of the press, since men are allowed to\r\npublish what they please of their own, and so far as this may be deemed\r\na restraint upon others it is certainly a reasonable one, and can be\r\nattended with no danger of copies not being sufficiently multiplied,\r\nbecause the interest of the proprietor will always induce him to\r\npublish a quantity fully equal to the demand. Besides, that such\r\nencouragement may give birth to many excellent writings which would\r\notherwise have never appeared.(77) If the Congress should exercise\r\nany other power over the press than this, they will do it without any\r\nwarrant from this constitution, and must answer for it as for any other\r\nact of tyranny.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the trial by jury in civil cases, it must be observed\r\nit is a mistake to suppose that such a trial takes place in all civil\r\ncases now. Even in the common law courts, such a trial is only had\r\nwhere facts are disputed between the parties, and there are even some\r\nfacts triable by other methods. In the Chancery and Admiralty Courts,\r\nin many of the States, I am told they have no juries at all. The States\r\nin these particulars differ very much in their practice from each\r\nother. A general declaration therefore to preserve the trial by jury\r\nin all civil cases would only have produced confusion, so that the\r\ncourts afterwards in a thousand instances would not have known how to\r\nhave proceeded.—If they had added, “as heretofore accustomed,” that\r\nwould not have answered the purpose, because there has been no uniform\r\ncustom about it.—If therefore the Convention had interfered, it must\r\nhave been by entering into a detail highly unsuitable to a fundamental\r\nconstitution of government; if they had pleased some States they must\r\nhave displeased others by innovating upon the modes of administering\r\njustice perhaps endeared to them by habit, and agreeable to their\r\nsettled conviction of propriety. As this was the case it appears\r\nto me it was infinitely better, rather than endanger everything by\r\nattempting too much, to leave this complicated business of detail to\r\nthe regulation of the future Legislature, where it can be adjusted\r\ncoolly and at ease, and upon full and exact information. There is no\r\ndanger of the trial by jury being rejected, when so justly a favorite\r\nof the whole people. The representatives of the people surely can have\r\nno interest in making themselves odious, for the mere pleasure of being\r\nhated, and when a member of the House of Representatives is only sure\r\nof being so for two years, but must continue a citizen all his life,\r\nhis interest as a citizen, if he is a man of common sense, to say\r\nnothing of his being a man of common honesty, must ever be uppermost in\r\nhis mind. We know the great influence of the monarchy in the British\r\ngovernment, and upon what a different tenure the Commons there have\r\ntheir seats in Parliament from that prescribed to our representatives.\r\nWe know also they have a large standing army. It is in the power of\r\nthe Parliament, if they dare to exercise it, to abolish the trial by\r\njury altogether. But woe be to the man who should dare to attempt it.\r\nIt would undoubtedly produce an insurrection, that would hurl every\r\ntyrant to the ground who attempted to destroy that great and just\r\nfavorite of the English nation. We certainly shall be always sure of\r\nthis guard at least upon any such act of folly or insanity in our\r\nrepresentatives. They soon would be taught the consequence of sporting\r\nwith the feelings of a free people. But when it is evident that such\r\nan attempt cannot be rationally apprehended, we have no reason to\r\nanticipate unpleasant emotions of that nature. There is indeed little\r\nprobability that any degree of tyranny which can be figured to the most\r\ndiscolored imagination as likely to arise out of our government, could\r\nfind an interest in attacking the trial by jury in civil cases;—and in\r\ncriminal ones, where no such difficulties intervene as in the other,\r\nand where there might be supposed temptations to violate the personal\r\nsecurity of a citizen, it is sacredly preserved.\r\n\r\nThe subject of a standing army has been exhausted in so masterly a\r\nmanner in two or three numbers of the Federalist (a work which I hope\r\nwill soon be in every body’s hands) that but for the sake of regularity\r\nin answering Mr. Mason’s objections, I should not venture upon the\r\nsame topic, and shall only presume to do so, with a reference for\r\nfuller satisfaction to that able performance. It is certainly one of\r\nthe most delicate and proper cases for the consideration of a free\r\npeople, and so far as a jealousy of this kind leads to any degree of\r\ncaution not incompatible with the public safety, it is undoubtedly to\r\nbe commended. Our jealousy of this danger has descended to us from our\r\nBritish ancestors; in that country they have a Monarch, whose power\r\nbeing limited, and at the same time his prerogatives very considerable,\r\na constant jealousy of him is both natural and proper. The two last\r\nof the Stuarts having kept up a considerable body of standing forces\r\nin time of peace for the clear and almost avowed purpose of subduing\r\nthe liberties of the people, it was made an article of the bill of\r\nrights at the revolution, “That the raising or keeping a standing army\r\nwithin the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with the consent\r\nof Parliament, is against law;” but no attempt was made, or I dare\r\nsay even thought of, to restrain the Parliament from exercise of\r\nthat right. An army has been kept on foot annually by authority of\r\nParliament, and I believe ever since the revolution they have had some\r\nstanding troops; disputes have frequently happened about the number,\r\nbut I don’t recollect any objection by the most zealous patriot,\r\nto the keeping up of any at all. At the same time, notwithstanding\r\nthe above practice of an annual vote (arising from a very judicious\r\ncaution), it is still in the power of Parliament to authorize the\r\nkeeping up of any number of troops for an indefinite time, and to\r\nprovide for their subsistence for any number of years. Considerations\r\nof prudence, not constitutional limits to their authority, alone\r\nrestrain such an exercise of it—our Legislature however will be\r\nstrongly guarded, though that of Great Britain is without any check\r\nat all. No appropriations of money for military services can continue\r\nlonger than two years. Considering the extensive services the general\r\ngovernment may have to provide for upon this vast continent, no forces\r\nwith any serious prospect of success could be attempted to be raised\r\nfor a shorter time. Its being done for so short a period, if there\r\nwere any appearance of ill designs in the government, would afford\r\ntime enough for the real friends of their country to sound an alarm,\r\nand when we know how easy it is to excite jealousy of any government,\r\nhow difficult for the people to distinguish from their real friends,\r\nthose factious men who in every country are ready to disturb its peace\r\nfor personal gratifications of their own, and those desperate ones\r\nto whom every change is welcome, we shall have much more reason to\r\nfear that the government may be overawed by groundless discontents,\r\nthan that it should be able, if contrary to every probability such\r\na government could be supposed willing, to effect any designs for\r\nthe destruction of their own liberties as well as those of their\r\nconstituents; for surely we ought ever to remember, that there will\r\nnot be a man in the government but who has been either mediately or\r\nimmediately recently chosen by the people, and that for too limited\r\na time to make any arbitrary designs consistent with common sense,\r\nwhen every two years a new body of representatives with all the energy\r\nof popular feelings will come, to carry the strong force of a severe\r\nnational control into every department of government. To say nothing\r\nof the one-third to compose the Senate coming at the same time, warm\r\nwith popular sentiments, from their respective assemblies. Men may\r\nbe sure to suggest dangers from any thing, but it may truly be said\r\nthat those who can seriously suggest the danger of a premeditated\r\nattack on the liberties of the people from such a government as this,\r\ncould with ease assign reasons equally plausible for mistrusting the\r\nintegrity of any government formed in any manner whatever; and really\r\nit does seem to me, that all their reasons may be fairly carried to\r\nthis position, that inasmuch as any confidence in any men would be\r\nunwise, as we can give no power but what may be grossly abused, we\r\nhad better give none at all, but continue as we are, or resolve into\r\ntotal anarchy at once, of which indeed our present condition falls very\r\nlittle short. What sort of a government would that be which, upon the\r\nmost certain intelligence that hostilities were meditated against it,\r\ncould take no method for its defence till after a formal declaration\r\nof war, or the enemy’s standard was actually fixed upon the shore? The\r\nfirst has for some time been out of fashion, but if it had not, the\r\nrestraint these gentlemen recommend, would certainly have brought it\r\ninto disuse with every power who meant to make war upon America. They\r\nwould be such fools as to give us the only warning we had informed\r\nthem we would accept of, before we would take any steps to counteract\r\ntheir designs. The absurdity of our being prohibited from preparing to\r\nresist an invasion till after it had actually taken place(78) is so\r\nglaring, that no man can consider it for a moment without being struck\r\nwith astonishment to see how rashly, and with how little consideration\r\ngentlemen, whose characters are certainly respectable, have suffered\r\nthemselves to be led away by so delusive an idea. The example of other\r\ncountries, so far from warranting any such limitation of power, is\r\ndirectly against it. That of England has already been particularly\r\nnoticed. In our present articles of confederation there is no such\r\nrestriction. It has been observed by the Federalist, that Pennsylvania\r\nand North Carolina appear to be the only States in the Union which\r\nhave attempted any restraint of the Legislative authority in this\r\nparticular, and that their restraint appears rather in the light of\r\na caution than a prohibition; but notwithstanding that, Pennsylvania\r\nhad been obliged to raise forces in the very face of that article\r\nof her bill of rights. That great writer from the remoteness of his\r\nsituation, did not know that North Carolina had equally violated her\r\nbill of rights in a similar manner. The Legislature of that State in\r\nNovember, 1785, passed an act for raising 200 men for the protection of\r\na county called Davidson county against hostilities from the Indians;\r\nthey were to continue for _two years_ from the time of their first\r\nrendezvous, unless sooner disbanded by the Assembly, and were to be\r\nsubject to the same “rules with respect to their government as were\r\nestablished in the time of the late war by the Congress of the United\r\nStates for the government of the Continental army.” These are the very\r\nwords of the act. Thus, from the examples of the only two countries in\r\nthe world that I believe ever attempted such a restriction, it appears\r\nto be a thing incompatible with the safety of government. Whether their\r\nrestriction is to be considered as a caution or a prohibition, in less\r\nthan five years after peace the caution has been disregarded, or the\r\nprohibition disobeyed.(79) Can the most credulous or suspicious men\r\nrequire stronger proof of the weakness and impolicy of such restraints?\r\n\r\nIX. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“The State Legislatures are restrained from laying export duties on\r\ntheir own produce.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nDuties upon exports, though they may answer in some particulars a\r\nconvenience to the country which imposes them, are certainly not things\r\nto be contended for, as if the very being of a State was interested in\r\npreserving them. Where there is a kind of monopoly they may sometimes\r\nbe ventured upon, but even there perhaps more is lost by imposing such\r\nduties, than is compensated for by any advantage. Where there is not a\r\nspecies of monopoly, no policy can be more absurd. The American States,\r\nare so circumstanced that some of the States necessarily export part of\r\nthe produce of neighboring ones. Every duty laid upon such exported\r\nproduce operates in fact as a tax by the exporting State upon the\r\nnon-exporting State. In a system expressly formed to produce concord\r\namong all, it would have been very unwise to have left such a source\r\nof discord open; and upon the same principle, and to remove as much as\r\npossible every ground of discontent, Congress itself are prohibited\r\nfrom laying duties on exports, because by that means those States which\r\nhave a great deal of produce to export would be taxed much more heavily\r\nthan those which had little or none for exportation.\r\n\r\nX. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“The general Legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further\r\nimportation of slaves for twenty odd years, though such importation\r\nrenders the United States weaker, more vulnerable; and less capable of\r\ndefence.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nIf all the States had been willing to adopt this regulation, I should\r\nas an individual most heartily have approved of it, because even if the\r\nimportation of slaves in fact rendered us stronger, less vulnerable and\r\nmore capable of defence, I should rejoice in the prohibition of it,\r\nas putting an end to a trade which has already continued too long for\r\nthe honor and humanity of those concerned in it. But as it was well\r\nknown that South Carolina and Georgia thought a further continuance of\r\nsuch importations useful to them, and would not perhaps otherwise have\r\nagreed to the new constitution, those States which had been importing\r\ntill they were satisfied, could not with decency have insisted upon\r\ntheir relinquishing advantages themselves had already enjoyed. Our\r\nsituation makes it necessary to bear the evil as it is. It will be\r\nleft to the future legislatures to allow such importations or not.\r\nIf any, in violation of their clear conviction of the injustice of\r\nthis trade, persist in pursuing it, this is a matter between God and\r\ntheir own consciences. The interests of humanity will, however, have\r\ngained something by the prohibition of this inhuman trade, though at a\r\ndistance of twenty odd years.\r\n\r\nXI. OBJECTION.\r\n\r\n“Both the general Legislature and the State Legislatures, have\r\nexpressly prohibited making _ex post facto_ laws, though there never\r\nwas, nor can be, a legislature but must and will make such laws, when\r\nnecessity and the public safety require them; which will hereafter be a\r\nbreach of all the constitutions in the Union, and offer precedents for\r\nother innovations.”\r\n\r\nANSWER.\r\n\r\nMy ideas of liberty are so different from those of Mr. Mason, that in\r\nmy opinion this very prohibition is one of the most valuable parts of\r\nthe new constitution. _Ex post facto_ laws may sometimes be convenient,\r\nbut that they are ever absolutely necessary I shall take the liberty\r\nto doubt, till that necessity can be made apparent. Sure I am, they\r\nhave been the instrument of some of the grossest acts of tyranny that\r\nwere ever exercised, and have this never failing consequence, to put\r\nthe minority in the power of a passionate and unprincipled majority,\r\nas to the most sacred things, and the plea of necessity is never\r\nwanting where it can be of any avail. This very clause, I think, is\r\nworth ten thousand declarations of rights, if this, the most essential\r\nright of all, was omitted in them. A man may feel some pride in his\r\nsecurity, when he knows that what he does innocently and safely to-day\r\nin accordance with the laws of his country, cannot be tortured into\r\nguilt and danger to-morrow. But if it should happen, that a great and\r\noverruling necessity, acknowledged and felt by all, should make a\r\ndeviation from this prohibition excusable, shall we not be more safe\r\nin leaving the excuse for an extraordinary exercise of power to rest\r\nupon the apparent equity of it alone, than to leave the door open to\r\na tyranny it would be intolerable to bear? In the one case, every one\r\nmust be sensible of its justice, and therefore excuse it; in the other,\r\nwhether its exercise was just or unjust, its being lawful would be\r\nsufficient to command obedience. Nor would a case like that, resting\r\nentirely on its own bottom, from a conviction of invincible necessity,\r\nwarrant an avowed abuse of another authority, where no such necessity\r\nexisted or could be pretended.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through Mr. Mason’s objections; one thing still\r\nremains to be taken notice of, his prediction, which he is pleased to\r\nexpress in these words: “This government will commence in a moderate\r\naristocracy; it is at present impossible to foresee, whether it\r\nwill in its operation produce a monarchy, or a corrupt, oppressive\r\naristocracy; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two,\r\nand then terminate in the one or the other.” From the uncertainty of\r\nthis prediction, we may hope that Mr. Mason was not divinely inspired\r\nwhen he made it, and of course that it may as fairly be questioned\r\nas any of his particular objections. If my answers to his objections\r\nare, in general, solid, a very different government will arise from\r\nthe new constitution, if the several States should adopt it, as I hope\r\nthey will. It will not probably be too much to flatter ourselves with,\r\nthat it may present a spectacle of combined strength in government,\r\nand genuine liberty in the people, the world has never yet beheld. In\r\nthe meantime, our situation is critical to the greatest degree. Those\r\ngentlemen who think we may at our ease go on from one convention to\r\nanother, to try if all objections cannot be conquered by perseverance,\r\nhave much more sanguine expectations than I can presume to form. There\r\nare critical periods in the fate of nations, as well as in the life of\r\nman, which are not to be neglected with impunity. I am much mistaken\r\nif this is not such a one with us. When we were at the very brink of\r\ndespair, the late excellent Convention with a unanimity that none\r\ncould have hoped for, generously discarding all little considerations\r\nformed a system of government which I am convinced can stand the nicest\r\nexamination, if reason and not prejudice is employed in viewing it.\r\nWith a happiness of thought, which in our present awful situation\r\nought to silence much more powerful objections than any I have heard,\r\nthey have provided in the very frame of government a safe, easy and\r\nunexceptionable method of correcting any errors it may be thought to\r\ncontain. Those errors may be corrected at leisure; in the mean time the\r\nacknowledged advantages likely to flow from this constitution may be\r\nenjoyed. We may venture to hold up our head among the other powers of\r\nthe world. We may talk to them with the confidence of an independent\r\npeople, having strength to resent insults; and avail ourselves of our\r\nnatural advantages. We may be assured of once more beholding justice,\r\norder and dignity taking place of the present anarchical confusion\r\nprevailing almost every where, and drawing upon us universal disgrace.\r\nWe may hope, by proper exertions of industry, to recover thoroughly\r\nfrom the shock of the late war, and truly to become an independent,\r\ngreat and prosperous people. But if we continue as we now are,\r\nwrangling about every trifle, listening to the opinion of a small\r\nminority, in preference to a large and most respectable majority of\r\nthe first men in our country, and among them some of the first in the\r\nworld, if our minds in short are bent rather on indulging a captious\r\ndiscontent, than bestowing a generous and well-placed confidence in\r\nthose who we have every reason to believe are entirely worthy of it,\r\nwe shall too probably present a spectacle for malicious exultation to\r\nour enemies, and melancholy dejection to our friends; and the honor,\r\nglory and prosperity which were just within our reach, will perhaps be\r\nsnatched from us for ever.\r\n\r\n  MARCUS.\r\n\r\n  _January, 1788._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn / Address / to the / Freemen / of / South Carolina, / on the subject\r\nof the / Federal Constitution, / Proposed by the Convention, which met\r\nin / Philadelphia, May, 1787. / Charleston, / Printed by Bowen and Co.,\r\nNo. 31, Bay.\r\n\r\n  16 mo., pp. 12.\r\n\r\n  Written by Dr. David Ramsay, member of the Continental Congress\r\n  and of the South Carolina State Convention which ratified the\r\n  Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Citizens_:\r\n\r\nYou have, at this time a new federal constitution proposed for your\r\nconsideration. The great importance of the subject demands your most\r\nserious attention. To assist you in forming a right judgment on this\r\nmatter, it will be proper to consider,\r\n\r\n1st. It is the manifest interest of these states to be united.\r\nInternal wars among ourselves, would most probably be the consequence\r\nof disunion. Our local weakness particularly proves it to be for the\r\nadvantage of South Carolina to strengthen the federal government; for\r\nwe are inadequate to secure ourselves from more powerful neighbours. [4]\r\n\r\n2d. If the thirteen states are to be united in reality, as well as in\r\nname, the obvious principle of the union will be, that the congress, or\r\ngeneral government, should have power to regulate all general concerns.\r\nIn a state of nature, each man is free, and may do what he pleases:\r\nbut in society, every individual must sacrifice a part of his natural\r\nrights; the minority must yield to the majority, and the collective\r\ninterest must control particular interests. When thirteen persons\r\nconstitute a family, each should forego everything that is injurious to\r\nthe other twelve. When several families constitute a parish, or county,\r\neach may adopt what regulations it pleases with regard to its domestic\r\naffairs, but must be abridged of that liberty in other cases, where the\r\ngood of the whole is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen several parishes, counties, or districts, form a state, the\r\nseparate interests of each must yield to the collective interest of\r\nthe whole. When several states combine in one government, the same\r\nprinciples must be observed. These relinquishments of natural rights,\r\nare not real sacrifices: each person, county, or state, gains more than\r\nit loses, for it only gives up a right of injuring others, and obtains\r\nin return aid and strength to secure itself in the peaceable enjoyment\r\nof all remaining rights. If then we are to be an united people, and\r\nthe obvious ground of union must be, that all continental concerns\r\nshould be managed by Congress—let us by those principles examine the\r\nnew constitution. Look over the 8th section, which enumerates the\r\npowers of Congress, and point out one that is not essential on the\r\nbefore recited principles of union. The first is a power to lay and\r\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and\r\nprovide for the [5] common defence and general welfare of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen you authorised Congress to borrow money, and to contract debts,\r\nfor carrying on the late war, you could not intend to abridge them of\r\nthe means of paying their engagements, made on your account. You may\r\nobserve that their future power is confined to provide _common defence\r\nand general welfare_ of the United States. If they apply money to any\r\nother purposes, they exceed their powers. The people of the United\r\nStates who pay, are to be judges how far their money is properly\r\napplied. It would be tedious to go over all the powers of Congress,\r\nbut it would be easy to show that they all may be referred to this\r\nsingle principle, “that the general concerns of the union ought to be\r\nmanaged by the general government.” The opposers of the constitution\r\ncannot show a single power delegated to Congress, that could be spared\r\nconsistently with the welfare of the whole, nor a single one taken\r\nfrom the states, but such as can be more advantageously lodged in the\r\ngeneral government, than in that of the separate states.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the states cannot emit money: This is not intended to\r\nprevent the emission of paper money, but only of state paper money. Is\r\nnot this an advantage? To have thirteen paper currencies in thirteen\r\nstates is embarrassing to commerce, and eminently so to travellers.\r\nIt is _therefore_, obviously our interest, either to have no paper,\r\nor such as will circulate from Georgia to New Hampshire. Take another\r\ninstance—the Congress are authorized to provide and maintain a\r\nnavy.—Our sea-coast, in its whole extent needs the protection\r\nthereof; but if this was to be done [6] by the states, they who build\r\nships, would be more secure than they who do not. Again, if the local\r\nlegislatures might build ships of war at pleasure, the Eastern would\r\nhave a manifest superiority over the Southern states. Observe, how\r\nmuch better this business is referred to the regulations of Congress.\r\nA common navy, paid out of the common treasury, and to be disposed\r\nof by the united voice of a majority for the common defence of the\r\nweaker as well as of the stronger states, is promised, and will result\r\nfrom the federal constitution. Suffer not yourselves to be imposed\r\non by declamation. Ask the man who objects to the powers of Congress\r\ntwo questions, _is_ it not necessary that the supposed dangerous\r\npower should be lodged somewhere? And secondly, where can it be\r\nlodged, consistently with the general good, so well as in the general\r\ngovernment? Decide for yourselves on these obvious principles of union.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected, that the eastern states have an advantage in\r\ntheir representation in Congress. Let us examine this objection—the\r\nfour eastern states send seventeen members to the house of\r\nrepresentatives, but Georgia, South-Carolina, North-Carolina and\r\nVirginia, send twenty-three. The six northern states send twenty-seven,\r\nthe six southern thirty. In both cases, we have a superiority;—but,\r\nsay the objectors, add Pennsylvania to the northern states, and there\r\nis a majority against us. It is obvious to reply, add Pennsylvania to\r\nthe southern states, and they have a majority. The objection amounts to\r\nno more than that seven are more than six. It must be known to many of\r\nyou, that the Southern states, from their vast extent of uncultivated\r\ncountry, are daily receiving new settlers; but in New England their\r\ncountry is [7] so small, and their land so poor, that their inhabitants\r\nare constantly emigrating. As the rule of representation in Congress\r\nis to vary with the number of inhabitants, our influence in the\r\ngeneral government will be constantly increasing. In fifty years, it\r\nis probable that the Southern states will have a great ascendancy\r\nover the Eastern. It has been said that thirty-five men, not elected\r\nby yourselves, may make laws to bind you. This objection, if it has\r\nany force, tends to the destruction of your state government. By our\r\nconstitution, sixty-nine make a quorum; of course, thirty-five members\r\nmay make a law to bind all the people of South-Carolina.—Charleston,\r\nand any one of the neighboring parishes send collectively thirty-six\r\nmembers; it is therefore possible, in the absence of all others, that\r\nthree of the lower parishes might legislate for the whole country.\r\nWould this be a valid objection against your own constitution? It\r\ncertainly would not—neither is it against the proposed federal plan.\r\nLearn from it this useful lesson—insist on the constant attendance of\r\nyour members, both in the state assembly, and Continental Congress;\r\nyour representation in the latter, is as numerous in a relative\r\nproportion with the other states as it ought to be. You have a\r\nthirteenth part in both houses; and you are not, on principles of\r\nequality, entitled to more.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected, that the president, and two-thirds of the senate,\r\nthough not of your election, may make treaties binding on the state.\r\nAsk these objectors—do you wish to have any treaties? They will say\r\nyes. Ask then who can be more properly trusted with the power of making\r\nthem, than they to whom the convention have referred it? Can the state\r\nlegislature? They would con- [8] sult their local interests.—Can the\r\nContinental House of Representatives? When sixty-five men can keep a\r\nsecret, they may.—Observe the cautious guards which are placed round\r\nyour interests. Neither the senate nor president can make treaties by\r\ntheir separate authority.—They must both concur.—This is more in\r\nyour favour than the footing on which you now stand. The delegates in\r\nCongress of nine states, without your consent, can now bind you; by the\r\nnew constitution there must be two-thirds of the members present, and\r\nalso the president, in whose election you have a vote. Two-thirds are\r\nto the whole, nearly as nine to thirteen. If you are not wanting to\r\nyourselves by neglecting to keep up the state’s compliment of senators,\r\nyour situation with regard to preventing the controul of your local\r\ninterests by the Northern states, will be better under the proposed\r\nconstitution than it is now under the existing confederation.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, we will have a navigation act, and be restricted to\r\nAmerican bottoms, and that high freight will be the consequence. We\r\ncertainly ought to have a navigation act, and we assuredly ought to\r\ngive a preference, though not a monopoly, to our own shipping.\r\n\r\nIf this state is invaded by a maritime force, to whom can we apply for\r\nimmediate aid?—To Virginia and North-Carolina? Before they can march\r\nby land to our assistance, the country may be overrun. The Eastern\r\nstates, abounding in men and in ships, can sooner relieve us, than\r\nour next door neighbours. It is therefore not only our duty, but our\r\ninterest to encourage their shipping. They have sufficient resources on\r\na few months notice, to furnish tonnage enough to carry off all your\r\nexports; and they can afford, and doubtless will undertake [9] to be\r\nyour carriers on as easy terms as you now pay for freight in foreign\r\nbottoms.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, let us consider what we have gained, also what they\r\nhave lost, by the revolution. We have gained a free trade with all the\r\nworld, and consequently a higher price for our commodities; it may be\r\nsaid, and so have they. But they who reply in this manner, ought to\r\nknow, that there is an amazing difference in our favour; their country\r\naffords no valuable exports, and of course the privilege of a free\r\ntrade is to them of little value, while our staple commodity commands\r\na higher price than was usual before the war. We have also gained\r\nan exemption from quit-rents, to which the eastern states were not\r\nsubjected. Connecticut and Rhode Island were nearly as free before the\r\nrevolution as since. They had no royal governor or councils to controul\r\nthem, or to legislate for them. Massachusetts and New Hampshire were\r\nmuch nearer independence in their late constitution than we were. The\r\neastern states, by the revolution, have been deprived of a market for\r\ntheir fish, of their carrying trade, their ship-building, and almost of\r\nevery thing but their liberties.\r\n\r\nAs the war has turned out so much in our favour, and so much against\r\nthem, ought we to grudge them the carrying of our produce, especially\r\nwhen it is considered, that by encouraging their shipping, we increase\r\nthe means of our own defence? Let us examine also the federal\r\nconstitution, by the principles of reciprocal concession. We have\r\nlaid a foundation for a navigation act. This will be a general good;\r\nbut particularly so to our northern brethren. On the other hand,\r\nthey have agreed to change the federal rule of paying the continental\r\ndebt, according to the value of land, as laid down in the confede- [10]\r\nration, for a new principle of apportionment, to be founded on the\r\nnumbers of inhabitants in the several states respectively. This is\r\nan immense concession in our favour. Their land is poor; our’s rich;\r\ntheir numbers great; our’s small; labour with them is done by white\r\nmen, for whom they pay an equal share; while five of our negroes only\r\ncount as equal to three of their whites. This will make a difference of\r\nmany thousands of pounds in settling our continental accounts. It is\r\nfarther objected, that they have stipulated for a right to prohibit the\r\nimportation of negroes after 21 years. On this subject observe, as they\r\nare bound to protect us from domestic violence, they think we ought\r\nnot to increase our exposure to that evil, by an unlimited importation\r\nof slaves. Though Congress may forbid the importation of negroes after\r\n21 years, it does not follow that they will. On the other hand, it is\r\nprobable that they will not. The more rice we make, the more business\r\nwill be for their shipping; their interest will therefore coincide with\r\nour’s. Besides, we have other sources of supply—the importation of the\r\nensuing 20 years, added to the natural increase of those we already\r\nhave, and the influx from our northern neighbours, who are desirous\r\nof getting rid of their slaves, will afford a sufficient number for\r\ncultivating all the lands in this state.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the union to be dissolved by the rejection of the new\r\nconstitution, what would be our case? The united states owe several\r\nmillions of dollars to France, Spain, and Holland. If an efficient\r\ngovernment is not adopted, which will provide for the payment of our\r\ndebt, especially of that which is due to foreigners—who will be the\r\nlosers? Most certainly the southern states. Our ex- [11] ports, as\r\nbeing the most valuable, would be the first objects of capture on\r\nthe high seas, or descents would be made on our defenceless coasts,\r\ntill the creditors of the United States had paid themselves at the\r\nexpense of this weaker part of the union. Let us also compare the\r\npresent confederation with the proposed constitution. The former can\r\nneither protect us at home, nor gain us respect abroad; it cannot\r\nsecure the payment of our debts, nor command the resources of our\r\ncountry, in case of danger. Without money, without a navy, or the means\r\nof even supporting an army of our own citizens in the field, we lie\r\nat the mercy of every invader; our seaport towns may be laid under\r\ncontribution, and our country ravaged.\r\n\r\nBy the new constitution, you will be protected with the force of the\r\nunion, against domestic violence and foreign invasion. You will have a\r\nnavy to defend your coast.—The respectable figure you will make among\r\nthe nations, will so far command the attention of foreign powers, that\r\nit is probable you will soon obtain such commercial treaties, as will\r\nopen to your vessels the West-India islands, and give life to your\r\nexpiring commerce.\r\n\r\nIn a country like our’s, abounding with free men all of one rank,\r\nwhere property is equally diffused, where estates are held in fee\r\nsimple, the press free, and the means of information common, tyranny\r\ncannot reasonably find admission under any form of government; but\r\nits admission is next to impossible under one where the people\r\nare the source of all power, and elect either mediately by their\r\nrepresentatives, or immediately by themselves the whole of their rulers.\r\n\r\nExamine the new constitution with candor and liberality. Indulge no\r\nnarrow prejudices to the disadvantage of your brethren of the [12]\r\nother states; consider the people of all the thirteen states, as a\r\nband of brethren, speaking the same language, professing the same\r\nreligion, inhabiting one undivided country, and designed by heaven\r\nto be one people. Content that what regards all the states should be\r\nmanaged by that body which represents all of them; be on your guard\r\nagainst the misrepresentations of men who are involved in debt; such\r\nmay wish to see the constitution rejected, because of the following\r\nclause, “no state shall emit bills of credit, make any thing but\r\ngold and silver coin, a tender in payment of debts, pass any _expost\r\nfacto_ law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.” This will\r\ndoubtless bear hard on debtors who wish to defraud their creditors,\r\nbut it will be real service to the honest part of the community.\r\nExamine well the characters and circumstances of men who are averse\r\nto the new constitution. Perhaps you will find that the above recited\r\nclause is the real ground of the opposition of some of them, though\r\nthey may artfully cover it with a splendid profession of zeal for state\r\nprivileges and general liberty.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if the proposed constitution be not calculated to better\r\nyour country, and to secure to you the blessings for which you have\r\nso successfully contended, reject it: but if it be an improvement on\r\nthe present confederation, and contains within itself the principles\r\nof farther improvement suited to future circumstances, join the mighty\r\ncurrent of federalism, and give it your hearty support. You were among\r\nthe first states that formed an independent constitution; be not among\r\nthe last in accepting and ratifying the proposed plan of federal\r\ngovernment; it is your sheet anchor; and without it independence may\r\nprove a curse.\r\n\r\n  CIVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n  AND\r\n  REFERENCE LIST\r\n  OF THE\r\n  HISTORY AND LITERATURE\r\n  OF THE\r\n  UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION\r\n  1787-1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe titles in the following list are arranged alphabetically, by\r\nthe authors or editors names if known, or by the first word of the\r\ntitle, omitting participles, with the exception of the editions of\r\nthe Constitution, which are brought together under that head, and the\r\ndebates and journals of the State Conventions, which are placed under\r\neach State.\r\n\r\nThe initials which precede the numbers at the end of the description,\r\nindicate certain public libraries in which the work may be consulted.\r\n\r\n  A.       signifies Astor Library.\r\n  A.

It is almost certain\r\n  that the Federal Convention, the Continental Congress, and each of\r\n  the states printed public official editions, (of which, excepting\r\n  Massachusetts, New York, and possibly Pennsylvania, I have been\r\n  unable to trace copies) while the editions printed for the use of the\r\n  people were undoubtedly numerous. The list includes every edition\r\n  that I could find, in any bibliographies or library catalogues that\r\n  I have examined, except the “Portsmouth, N. H. 1787” given in the\r\n  Library of Congress catalogue, which cannot now be found. I have also\r\n  included the two drafts (Nos. 19 and 20) used by the Convention,\r\n  which, though not properly editions of the Constitution, nevertheless\r\n  seemed best classed among them.

Nos. 9, 14, 23-5, and 34 appeared simultaneously in two\r\n  or more papers. Nos. 77-85 first appeared in the first edition in\r\n  book form. The first publication of the remaining essays I have not\r\n  been able to find.\r\n\r\n  Jay wrote Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 64; Madison, Nos. 10, 14, 37 to 48\r\n  inclusive; Nos. 18, 19 and 20 are the joint work of Madison and\r\n  Hamilton; Nos. 49 to 58, 62 and 63 are claimed by both Madison and\r\n  Hamilton; the rest of the numbers are by Hamilton. The authorship\r\n  of the 12 numbers claimed by both Madison and Hamilton are fully\r\n  discussed by Mr. Lodge in _The Proceedings of the American\r\n  Antiquarian Society for 1882_, and Volume ix of _The Works of\r\n  Hamilton_; by Mr. Dawson and Mr. J.

They frequently say a good deal,\r\n  which does not apply; but yet if it will not convince the judge\r\n  and jury, may perhaps, help to make them forget some part of the\r\n  evidence—embarass their opponents, and make the audience stare.” _N.\r\n  Y.

The most\r\n  diligent search has been made for a copy of that edition, but\r\n  without finding it or obtaining any other information concerning\r\n  it. It is not in any of the principal public libraries, nor, so far\r\n  as can be learned, is a copy of it in any private library in this\r\n  part of the country. The newspapers of that period—both Foederal and\r\n  Republican—have been carefully examined, with the hope of finding the\r\n  Proposals for its publication; personal enquiries have been made of\r\n  Mr. Tiebout’s sons, and of several of the older inhabitants of the\r\n  city; and those whose intimate knowledge of books entitles them to\r\n  the respect of every student have been applied to on the subject; yet\r\n  no trace whatever, beyond the single allusion above referred to, has\r\n  been obtained from any quarter concerning this or any other edition\r\n  of _The Federalist_ from the press of John Tiebout.” _Mr. Dawson’s\r\n  Introduction to The Federalist_, lxvii\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Dawson, after the most exhaustive research, failed to find a\r\n  copy, and only heard of one, or what appeared to be one, in the\r\n  collection of Mr. Force, while his own volume was passing through the\r\n  press, and he was therefore compelled to leave the existence of such\r\n  an edition largely a matter of conjecture. This gap is now filled.\r\n  There is a copy of this edition, probably unique, for the Force copy\r\n  has disappeared, in the Long Island Historical Society.” _Mr. Lodge’s\r\n  Introduction to The Federalist._\r\n\r\n  This copy mentioned by Mr. Lodge is however, imperfect, there being\r\n  but one volume.\r\n\r\n_The Federalist.

See No. 41.\r\n\r\n  “In the year 1802, Mr. Hopkins, printer, of this city, intending to\r\n  publish a new edition of The Federalist, took this opportunity to\r\n  apply to Gen. Hamilton, and solicit him to correct and revise the\r\n  numbers, and, so far succeeded, as to obtain his consent to assist in\r\n  the revisal, provided a gentleman of competent literary talents would\r\n  undertake to make the first verbal corrections, for the original idea\r\n  was to be strictly adhered to:—He then examined the whole with his\r\n  own eye, previous to its being committed to the press, and saw that\r\n  it was free from literary blemishes.” William A.

This annihilates the legislature, and\r\nreduces it to an advisory body. It almost wholly supersedes the uses of\r\n_representation_, the most excellent improvement in modern governments.\r\nBesides the absurdity of constituting a legislature, without supreme\r\npower, such a system will keep the state perpetually embroiled. It\r\ncarries the spirit of discussion into all quarters, without the means\r\nof reconciling the opinions of men, who are not assembled to hear\r\neach others’ arguments. They debate with themselves—form their own\r\nopinions, without the reasons which influence others, and without the\r\nmeans of information. Thus the warmth of different opinions, which, in\r\nother states, dies in the legislature, is diffused through the state\r\nof Pennsylvania, and becomes personal and permanent. The seeds of\r\ndissension are sown in the constitution, and no state, except Rhode\r\nIsland, is so distracted by factions.\r\n\r\n(5) In the decline of the republic, bribery or military force obtained\r\nthis office for persons who had not attained this age—Augustus was\r\nchosen at the age of twenty; or rather obtained it with his sword.\r\n\r\n(6) [“Query.”]\r\n\r\n(7) [of]\r\n\r\n(8) I say the senate was _elective_—but this must be understood with\r\nsome exceptions; or rather qualifications. The constitution of the\r\nRoman senate has been a subject of enquiry, with the first men in\r\nmodern ages. Lord Chesterfield requested the opinion of the learned\r\nVertot, upon the manner of chusing senators in Rome; and it was a\r\nsubject of discussion between Lord Harvey and Dr. Middleton. The most\r\nprobable account of the manner of forming the senate, and filling\r\nup vacancies, which I have collected from the best writers on this\r\nsubject, is here abridged for the consideration of the reader.\r\n\r\nRomulus chose one hundred persons, from the principal families in Rome,\r\nto form a council or senate; and reserved to himself the right of\r\nnominating their successors; that is of filling vacancies. “Mais comme\r\nRomulus avoit lui même choisi les premiers senateurs il se reserva le\r\ndroit de nommer a son gré, leurs successeurs.”—Mably, sur les Romains.\r\nOther well informed historians intimate that Romulus retained the right\r\nof nominating the president only. After the union of the Sabines with\r\nthe Romans, Romulus added another hundred members to the senate, but by\r\n_consent of the people_. Tarquin, the _ancient_, added another hundred;\r\nbut historians are silent as to the manner.\r\n\r\nOn the destruction of Alba by Hostilius, some of the principal Alban\r\nfamilies were added to the senate, _by consent of the senate and\r\npeople_.\r\n\r\nAfter the demolition of the monarchy, Appius Claudius was admitted into\r\nthe senate by _order of the people_.\r\n\r\nCicero testifies that, from the extinction of the monarchy, all the\r\nmembers of the senate were admitted by _command of the people_.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the first creation of the senators was the act of\r\nthe monarch; and the first patrician families claimed the sole right\r\nof admission into the senate. “Les familles qui descendoient des deux\r\ncent senateurs que “Romulus avoit créés,—se crurent seules en droit\r\nd’entrer dans le sénat.”—Mably\r\n\r\nThis right however was not granted in its utmost extent; for many\r\nof the senators in the Roman commonwealth, were taken from plebian\r\nfamilies. For sixty years before the institution of the _censorship_,\r\nwhich was A. U. C. 311, we are not informed how vacancies in the senate\r\nwere supplied. The most probable method was this; to enrol, in the list\r\nof senators, the different magistrates; viz., the consuls, prætors, the\r\ntwo quætors of patrician families, the five tribunes (afterwards ten)\r\nand the two ædiles of plebian families: The office of quæstor gave an\r\nimmediate admission into the senate. The tribunes were admitted two\r\nyears after their creation. This enrollment seems to have been a matter\r\nof course; and likewise their confirmation by the people in their\r\ncomitia or assemblies.\r\n\r\nOn extraordinary occasions, when the vacancies of the senate were\r\nnumerous, the consuls used to nominate some of the most respectable of\r\nthe equestrian order, to be chosen by the people.\r\n\r\nOn the institution of the censorship, the censors were invested with\r\nfull powers to inspect the manners of the citizens,—enrol them in\r\ntheir proper ranks according to their property,—make out lists of the\r\nsenators and leave out the names of such as had rendered themselves\r\nunworthy of their dignity by any scandalous vices. This power they\r\nseveral times exercised; but the disgraced senators had an appeal to\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nAfter the senate had lost half its members in the war with Hannibal,\r\nthe dictator, M. Fabius Buteo, filled up the number with the\r\nmagistrates, with those who had been honored with a civic crown, or\r\nothers who were respectable for age and character. One hundred and\r\nseventy new members were added at once, with _the approbation of the\r\npeople_. The vacancies occasioned by Sylla’s proscriptions amounted to\r\nthree hundred, which were supplied by persons nominated by Sylla and\r\n_chosen by the people_.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of the Gracchi, the number of senators did not\r\nexceed three hundred. But in Sylla’s time, so far as we can collect\r\nfrom direct testimonies, it amounted to about five hundred. The\r\nage necessary to qualify for a seat in the senate is not exactly\r\nascertained; but several circumstances prove it to have been about\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\nSee Vertot, Mably, and Middleton on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn the last ages of Roman splendor, the property requisite to qualify\r\na person for a senator, was settled by Augustus at eight hundred\r\nsestertia—more than six thousand pounds sterling.\r\n\r\n(9) [“Between states, and excluding negroes,” added in author’s\r\ncopy.—P. L. F.]\r\n\r\n(10) It is a capital defect of most of the state-constitutions, that the\r\nsenators, like the representatives, are chosen in particular districts.\r\nThey are thus inspired with local views, and however wrong it may be\r\nto entertain them, yet such is the constitution of human nature, that\r\nmen are almost involuntarily attached to the interest of the district\r\nwhich has reposed confidence in their abilities and integrity. Some\r\npartiality therefore for constituents is always expectable. To destroy\r\nit as much as possible, a political constitution should remove the\r\ngrounds of local attachment. Connecticut and Maryland have wisely\r\ndestroyed this attachment in their senates, by ordaining that the\r\nmembers shall be chosen in the _state at large_. The senators hold\r\ntheir seats by the suffrages of the state, _not of a district_; hence\r\nthey have no particular number of men to fear or to oblige.—They\r\nrepresent _the state_; hence that union and firmness which the senates\r\nof those states have manifested on the most trying occasions, and by\r\nwhich they have prevented the most rash and iniquitous measures.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that when the election of senators is vested in the\r\npeople, they must choose men in their own neighborhood, or else those\r\nwith whom they are unacquainted. With respect to representatives, this\r\nobjection does not lie; for they are chosen in small districts; and as\r\nto senators, there is, in every state, a small number of men, whose\r\nreputation for abilities, integrity and good conduct will lead the\r\npeople to a very just choice. Old experienced statesmen should compose\r\nthe senate; and people are generally, in this free country, acquainted\r\nwith their characters. Were it possible, as it is in small states, it\r\nwould be an improvement in the doctrine of representation, to give\r\nevery freeman the right of voting for every member of the legislature,\r\nand the privilege of choosing the men in any part of the state. This\r\nwould totally exclude bribery and undue influence; for no man can bribe\r\na state; and it would almost annihilate partial views in legislation.\r\nBut in large states it may be impracticable.\r\n\r\n(11) [of]\r\n\r\n(12) It is said by some, that no property should be required as a\r\nqualification for an elector. I shall not enter into a discussion of\r\nthe subject; but remark that in most free governments, some property\r\nhas been thought requisite, to prevent corruption and secure government\r\nfrom the influence of an unprincipled multitude.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Rome none but the free citizens had the right of a suffrage\r\nin the _comitia_ or legislative assemblies. But in Sylla’s time the\r\nItalian cities demanded the rights of the Roman citizens; alledging\r\nthat they furnished two-thirds of the armies, in all their wars, and\r\nyet were despised as foreigners. Vell Paterc. lib. 2. cap. 15. This\r\nproduced the _Marsic_ or _social_ war, which lasted two years, and\r\ncaried off 300,000 men. Ibm. It was conducted and concluded by Pompey,\r\nfather of Pompey the Great, with his lieutenants Sylla and Marius.\r\nBut most of the cities eventually obtained _the freedom of Rome_; and\r\nwere of course entitled to the rights of suffrage in the comitia.\r\n“Paulatim deinde recipiendo in civitatem, qui arma aut non ceperant aut\r\ndeposuerant maturiùs, vires refectæ sunt.” Vell. Paterc. 2. 16.\r\n\r\nBut Rome had cause to deplore this event, for however reasonable it\r\nmight appear to admit the allies to a participation of the rights of\r\ncitizens, yet the concession destroyed all freedom of election. It\r\nenabled an ambitious demagogue to engage and bring into the assemblies,\r\nwhole towns of people, slaves and foreigners;—and everything was\r\ndecided by faction and violence. This Montesquieu numbers among the\r\ncauses of the decline of the Roman greatness. De la grandeur des\r\nRomains, c. 9.\r\n\r\nRepresentation would have, in some measure, prevented the consequences;\r\nbut the admission of every man to a suffrage will ever open the door to\r\ncorruption. In such a state as Connecticut, where there is no conflux\r\nof foreigners, no introduction of seamen, servants, &c., and scarcely\r\nan hundred persons in the state who are not natives, and very few whose\r\neducation and connexions do not attach them to the government; at the\r\nsame time few men have property to furnish the means of corruption,\r\nvery little danger could spring from admitting every man of age and\r\ndiscretion to the privilege of voting for rulers. But in the large\r\ntowns of America there is more danger. A master of a vessel may put\r\nvotes in the hands of his crew, for the purpose of carrying an election\r\nfor a party. Such things have actually taken place in America. Besides,\r\nthe middle states are receiving emigrations of poor people, who are\r\nnot at once judges of the characters of men, and who cannot be safely\r\ntrusted with the choice of legislators.\r\n\r\n(13) [These two paragraphs struck out in author’s copy.—P. L. F.]\r\n\r\n(14) [Last two sentences struck out in author’s copy.—P. L. F.]\r\n\r\n(15) The clause may at first appear ambiguous. It may be uncertain\r\nwhether we should read and understand it thus—“The Congress shall\r\nhave power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises\r\n_in order to pay the debts_,” &c. or whether the meaning is—“The\r\nCongress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and\r\nexcises, and _shall have power to pay the debts_,” &c. On considering\r\nthe construction of the clause, and comparing it with the preamble,\r\nthe last sense seems to be improbable and absurd. But it is not very\r\nmaterial; for no powers are vested in Congress but what are included\r\nunder the general expressions, of _providing for the common defence\r\nand general welfare of the United States_. Any powers not promotive\r\nof these purposes, will be unconstitutional;—consequently any\r\nappropriations of money to any other purpose will expose the Congress\r\nto the resentment of the states, and the members to impeachment and\r\nloss of their seats.\r\n\r\n(16) [“O” changed to “good” in author’s copy P.

But this _virtue_ consisted in pride, contempt of\r\nstrangers and a martial enthusiasm which sometimes displayed itself in\r\ndefence of their country. These principles are never permanent—they\r\ndecay with refinement, intercourse with other nations and increase of\r\nwealth. No wonder then that these republics declined, for they were not\r\nfounded on fixed principles; and hence authors imagine that republics\r\ncannot be durable. None of the celebrated writers on government seems\r\nto have laid sufficient stress on a general possession of real property\r\nin fee-simple. Even the authors of the _Political Sketches_, in the\r\n_Museum_ for the month of September, seems to have passed it over\r\nin silence; although he combats Montesquieu’s system, and to prove\r\nit false, enumerates some of the principles which distinguish our\r\ngovernments from others, and which he supposes constitutes the support\r\nof republics.\r\n\r\nThe English writers on law and government consider Magna Charta,\r\ntrial by juries, the Habeas Corpus act, and the liberty of the press,\r\nas the bulwarks of freedom. All this is well. But in no government\r\nof consequence in Europe, is freedom established on its true and\r\nimmoveable foundation. The property is too much accumulated, and\r\nthe accumulations too well guarded, to admit the _true principle of\r\nrepublics_. But few centuries have elapsed, since the body of the\r\npeople were vassals. To such men, the smallest extension of popular\r\nprivileges, was deemed an invaluable blessing. Hence the encomiums upon\r\ntrial by juries, and the articles just mentioned. But these people\r\nhave never been able to mount to the source of _liberty_, _estates\r\nin fee_, or at least but partially; they are yet obliged to drink at\r\nthe streams. Hence the English jealousy of certain rights, which are\r\nguaranteed by acts of parliament. But in America, and here alone, we\r\nhave gone at once to the _fountain of liberty_, and raised the people\r\nto their true dignity. Let the lands be possessed by the people in\r\nfee-simple, let the fountain be kept pure, and the streams will be\r\npure of course. Our jealousy of _trial by jury_, _the liberty of\r\nthe press_, &c., is totally groundless. Such rights are inseparably\r\nconnected with the _power_ and _dignity_ of the people, which rest on\r\ntheir _property_. They cannot be abridged. All _other_ [free] nations\r\nhave wrested _property_ and _freedom_ from _barons_ and _tyrants_; _we_\r\nbegin our empire with full possession of property and all its attending\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n(28) [Last three sentences struck out in author’s copy.—P.

It is well known, that in most of the\r\nstates the members of their Houses of Representatives are chosen in\r\nequal numbers from each county, and in the eastern states, in equal\r\nnumbers from each town, without any regard to the number of taxable\r\ninhabitants, or the number of souls. Hence it is very frequent for\r\na county, with ten thousand souls, to send only the same number of\r\nmembers to the state house of representatives, as a county with two\r\nthousand souls, by which each person in the least populous county has\r\nfive times as great a voice in electing representatives, as his fellow\r\ncitizen of the most populous county. This is clearly a departure from\r\nthe principles of equal liberty, and ought to be altered in the several\r\nstates. I speak the more plainly because our state constitution is free\r\nfrom that fault in the formation of our house of Assembly. Now the new\r\nconstitution expressly declares, that the fœderal Representatives shall\r\nbe in the proportion of one to every thirty thousand, which accords\r\nwith reason and the true principles of liberty. This house, therefore,\r\nso far as national matters go, will remedy the evil spoken of in the\r\nseveral states, and is one more great step towards the perfection of\r\nequal liberty and genuine republicanism in America. It must strongly\r\nrecommend the fœderal constitution to the serious reflecting patriot,\r\neven though he may formerly have had doubts, and it will suggest to\r\nthe several states the propriety of reconsidering that point in their\r\nrespective constitutions. Pennsylvania, though right in the principles\r\non which her legislative elections are and will be held, is less safe\r\nfrom the existence of this fault in the adjoining sister states of\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Jersey, Delaware and New York, and in others more\r\nremote.\r\n\r\n(38) The candid Reader will suppose Mr. WILSON here means, that it is\r\nthe best form of fœderal government, which has ever been offered to the\r\nworld—and it is surely true that the fœderal constitution, considered\r\nin due connexion with the state constitutions, is the best form of\r\ngovernment that has ever been communicated to mankind.\r\n\r\n(39) See some late publications.\r\n\r\n(40) See late publications.\r\n\r\n(41) “The error of those who reason by precedent, drawn from antiquity,\r\nrespecting the rights of man, is, that they do not go far enough into\r\nantiquity. They do not go the whole way. They stop in some of the\r\nintermediate stages of an hundred or a thousand years, and produce what\r\nwas then done, as a rule for the present day. This is no authority at\r\nall. If we travel still further into antiquity, we shall find a direct\r\ncontrary opinion and practice prevailing; and if antiquity is to be\r\nauthority, a thousand such authorities may be produced, successively\r\ncontradicting each other: but if we proceed on, at last we shall come\r\nout right: We shall then come to the time when man came from the hand\r\nof his Maker. What was he then? _Man._ Man was his high and only title,\r\nand a higher cannot be given him——We are now got at the origin of\r\nman, and at the origin of his rights.——Every history of the creation,\r\nand every traditionary account, whether from the lettered or unlettered\r\nworld, however they may vary in their opinion or belief of certain\r\nparticulars, all agree in establishing one point, the _unity_ of man;\r\nby which I mean that man is all of one degree, and consequently that\r\nall men are born equal, and with equal natural rights. By considering\r\nman in this light, it places him in a close connection with all his\r\nduties, whether to his _Creator_, or to the creation, of which he is a\r\npart; and it is only where he forgets his _origin_, or, to use a more\r\nfashionable phrase, his birth and family, that he becomes dissolute.\r\n\r\n“Hitherto we have spoken only (and that but in part) of the natural\r\nrights of man. We have now to consider the civil rights of man, and to\r\nshew how the one _originates_ out of the other.—Man did not enter into\r\nsociety, to become worse than he was before, nor to have less rights\r\nthan he had before, but to have those rights _better secured_. His\r\nnatural rights are the foundation of all his civil rights. But in order\r\nto pursue this distinction with more precision, it will be necessary to\r\nmark the different qualities of natural and civil rights.\r\n\r\n“A few words will explain this. Natural rights are those which\r\nappertain to man in the right of his existence—civil rights are those\r\nwhich appertain to man in right of his being a member of society. Every\r\ncivil right has for its foundation some natural right pre-existing in\r\nthe individual, but to unite his individual power is not, in all cases,\r\nsufficiently competent. Of this kind are all those which relate to\r\n_security_ and _protection_.\r\n\r\n“From this short review it will be easy to distinguish between that\r\nclass of natural rights which man retains after entering into society,\r\nand those which he throws into _common stock_ as a member of society.\r\nThe natural rights which he retains, are all those in which the power\r\nto execute is as perfect in the individual as the right itself.—The\r\nnatural rights which are not retained, are all those in which, though\r\nthe right is perfect in the individual, the power to execute them is\r\ndefective: _they answer not his purpose_—those he _deposits_ in the\r\n_common stock_ of society, and takes the arm of society, of which he is\r\na part, in preference and in addition to his own. Society grants him\r\nnothing. Every man is a proprietor in society, and draws on the capital\r\nas a matter of right.”—“_Rights of Man_,” 1791, page 30, 31.\r\n\r\n(42) “We have now traced Man from a natural individual to a member of\r\nsociety——Civil power, properly considered as such is made up of the\r\n_aggregate_ of that class of the natural rights, which become defective\r\nin the individual in point of power, and _answers not his purpose_; but\r\nwhen collected into a focus, becomes competent to the purpose of every\r\none.——Let us now apply those principles to government.——\r\n\r\n“Individuals themselves, each in his own personal and sovereign right,\r\nentered into a compact with each other, to produce a government; and\r\nthis is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and\r\nthe only principle on which they have a right to exist.\r\n\r\n“A _constitution_ is not a thing in name only, but in fact.—It\r\nhas not an ideal but a real existence, and wherever it cannot be\r\nproduced in a visible form, there is none. A _constitution_ is a thing\r\nantecedent to a _government_; and a government is only the creature\r\nof a constitution.—A constitution of a country is not the act of its\r\ngovernment, but of the people constituting a government. It is the\r\nbody of elements to which you can refer, and quote article by article;\r\nand which contains the principles on which the government shall be\r\nestablished, the manner in which it shall be organized, the powers\r\nit shall have, the mode of election, the duration of parliaments, or\r\nby what other name such bodies may be called, the powers which the\r\nexecutive part of the government shall have; and, in fine, every thing\r\nthat relates to the complete _organization_ of a civil government,\r\nand the principles on which it shall act, and by which it shall be\r\nbound.”—“_Rights of Man_,” page 35, 36.\r\n\r\n“What is a constitution? it is the form of government, delineated by\r\nthe mighty hand of the people, in which certain first principles or\r\nfundamental laws are established. The constitution is certain and\r\nfixed; it contains the permanent will of the people, and is the supreme\r\nlaw of the land; it is paramount to the power of the legislature, and\r\ncan be revoked or altered only by the authority that made it.—What\r\nare legislatures? creatures of the constitution, they owe their\r\nexistence to the constitution—they derive their powers from the\r\nconstitution.—It is their commission, and therefore all their acts\r\nmust be conformable to it, or else void. The _constitution_ is the work\r\nor will of the _people themselves_, in their original, sovereign, and\r\nunlimited capacity. Law is the work or will of the legislature in their\r\nderivative capacity.”\r\n\r\nJudge Patterson’s charge to the Jury in the Wioming case of Vanhorne’s\r\nlessee against Dorrance; tried at the circuit-court for the United\r\nStates, held at Philadelphia, April term, 1795.\r\n\r\n(43} Constitutional properties are only, as has been observed at the\r\nbeginning of this letter, parts in the organization of the contributed\r\nrights. As long as those parts preserve the orders assigned to them\r\nrespectively by the constitution, they may so far be said to be\r\nbalanced: but, when one part, without being sufficiently checked by the\r\nrest, abuses its power to the manifest danger of public happiness, or\r\nwhen the several parts abuse their respective powers so as to involve\r\nthe commonwealth in the like peril, _the people_ must restore things\r\nto that order, from which their functionaries have departed. If _the\r\npeople_ suffer this living principle of watchfulness and controul to\r\nbe extinguished among them, they will assuredly not long afterwards\r\nexperience that of their “temple,” “there shall not be left one stone\r\nupon another, that shall not be thrown down.”\r\n\r\n(44) When the _controuling power_ is in a constitution, it has\r\nthe _nation_ for its support, and the _natural_ and the political\r\ncontrouling powers are together. The laws which are enacted by the\r\ngovernments, controul men only as individuals, but the _nation_, thro’\r\nits constitution controuls _the whole government,_ and has a _natural\r\nability_ to do so. The _final controuling_ power, therefore, and the\r\n_original constituting_ power, _are one and the same power_.—“_Rights\r\nof Man_,” 1792. part 2d, b. 4, page 42.\r\n\r\n(45) See late publications against the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n(46) Blackstone, III. 279\r\n\r\n(47) Idem, IV. 350.\r\n\r\n(48) Idem, III. 381.\r\n\r\n(49) Instead of referring to musty records and mouldy parchments\r\nto prove that the rights of the living are lost, “renounced, and\r\nabdicated for ever,” by those who are now no more.—M. de la Fayette,\r\nin his address to the national assembly, applies to the living world,\r\nand says—“Call to mind the sentiments which nature has engraved\r\nin the heart of every citizen, and which take a new face when they\r\nare solemnly recognized by all.

Disappointed in these speculations, tho’\r\nthe vast armaments of their enemies were constantly rolling towards\r\nthem, still there was no firmness in their union, no vigor in their\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nThe Persian army passed the Hellespont, and directed its march\r\nwestward. It was then decided, that Thessaly was the frontier to be\r\nfirst attacked.\r\n\r\nThe Thessalians, than whom no people had been more forward in the\r\ncommon cause, hastened a remonstrance to Corinth, urging that unless\r\nthey were immediately and powerfully supported, necessity would oblige\r\nthem to make terms with the invaders.\r\n\r\nThis reasonable remonstrance roused the sluggish and hesitating\r\ncouncils of the confederacy. A body of foot was dispatched who soon\r\noccupied the valley of Tempe, the only pass from Lower Macedonia, into\r\nThessaly.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, these troops being informed that there was another pass\r\nfrom Upper Macedonia, returned to the Corinthian Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe Thessalians thus deserted made their submission.\r\n\r\n“This retreat from Tempe appears to have been a precipate measure,\r\nrendered necessary by nothing so much as by _the want of some powers_\r\nof government extending over the several states which composed the\r\nconfederacy.”—Mitford’s _History of Greece_.\r\n\r\nWith diminished forces, the defence of the confederates was now\r\nto be contracted. But in the conduct even of this business daily\r\nbecoming more urgent, we find them laboring under the defects of their\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\n“Destitute of any sufficient power extending over the whole, no\r\npart could confide in the protection of the whole, while the naval\r\nsuperiority of their enemy put it in his choice, where, when, and\r\nhow to make his attacks; and therefore each republic seems to have\r\nbeen anxious to reserve its own strength for future contingencies.\r\n\r\nTheir generous hearts all beat at the call of freedom; but their\r\nefforts were embarrassed and enfeebled by the vices of their political\r\nconstitution, to their prodigious detriment, and almost to their total\r\ndestruction. For these vices, the ardor of heroism united with love of\r\ncountry could not compensate. These very vices therefore, may truly be\r\nsaid to have wasted the blood of patriots, and to have betrayed their\r\ncountry into the severest calamities.\r\n\r\nIf we shall hereafter by experience discover any vices in our\r\nconstitution, let us _hasten_ with prudence and a fraternal affection\r\nfor each other, to correct them. We are all embarked in the same\r\nvessel, and equally concerned in repairing any defects.\r\n\r\n(56) See objections against the Federal constitution, very similar to\r\nthose made in Scotland.\r\n\r\n(57) Justice Blackstone argues in like manner, after admitting the\r\n“expediency” of titles of nobility. “It is also expedient that\r\ntheir owners should form an independent and separate branch of the\r\nlegislature”—otherwise “their privileges would soon be borne down and\r\noverwhelmed.”—Comment. 2. 157.\r\n\r\n(58) No member of parliament ought to be elected by fewer than the\r\nmajority of 800, upon the most moderate calculation, according to\r\nDoctor Price.\r\n\r\n(59) By the constitution proposed to us, a majority of the house of\r\nrepresentatives, and of the senate, makes a quorum to do business: but,\r\nif the writer is not mistaken, about a fourteenth part of the members\r\nof the house of commons, makes a quorum for that purpose.\r\n\r\n(60) If to the union of England and Scotland, a just connection with\r\nIreland be added, ecclesiastical establishments duly amended; additions\r\nto the peerage regulated, and representation of the commons properly\r\nimproved, it is to be expected, that the tranquility, strength,\r\nreputation, and prosperity of the empire will be greatly promoted, the\r\nmonarchy will probably change into a republic, if representation in the\r\nhouse of commons is not encreased by additions from the counties and\r\ngreat trading cities and towns, without this precaution, an increase\r\nof the peerage seems likely to accelerate an alteration. These two\r\nmeasures should have, it is apprehended, in such a government and in\r\nsuch a progress of human affairs, a well-tempered co-operation. The\r\npower of the crown might thereby become more dignified, moderated, and\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of this subject would embrace a very great number\r\nof considerations; but the conclusion seems to approach as near to\r\ndemonstration, as an investigation of this kind can do.\r\n\r\n(61) Against what is called equality in representation, the great\r\nMontesquieu seems to have declared by the strongest implication. In\r\nhis Spirit of Laws, b. ch. 2, he says, that the confederate republic\r\nof Lycia contained twenty-three associated towns: that, in the common\r\ncouncil, the larger towns had three votes, the middling towns two,\r\nand the lesser only one; that they contributed to the common expence\r\naccording to the proportion of suffrages; and, that were he to give\r\nthe model of an excellent confederate republic, it should be that of\r\nLycia. Could the immortal spirit of Montesquieu revisit the earth, and\r\nbehold the model now offered to America, how quickly would his favorite\r\nrepublic sink in his estimation. In a new quarter of the globe scarcely\r\nheard of by the greater part of Europeans in his day, and since the\r\ncommencement of the present century, he would see men who have attained\r\na perfection in the science most conducive to human happiness, in that\r\nstudy which was the principal occupation of his life, in which his\r\npredecessors had acquired only a few glimmering lights, and of which it\r\nwas reserved for him to develope most of the true first principles.\r\n\r\n(62) Whether the state of Maryland shall be divided into six districts,\r\nfor each to choose one man, or the people at large give their suffrage\r\nfor the whole six, is hereafter to be settled by the assembly. The\r\nlatter mode, on a variety of occasions, would be preferable.\r\n\r\n(63) The importance of having the western territory determined a common\r\nstock, needs only to be mentioned, to excite attention.\r\n\r\nAs the articles of confederation contain no provision, for adjusting\r\nthe dispute between the United States, and particular states, Maryland,\r\nfor a long time, refused her ratification. An adequate provision is\r\nmade by the proposed plan. That the United States will assuredly\r\ninstitute actions against two of the states, setting up claims equally\r\nwild and extensive, may appear from the following statement.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, have\r\nbeen always interested in making good the common claim; as they never\r\nlaid any particular claim to the territory in question.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, if the province of Maine be separate, is likewise become\r\ninterested in the common claim.\r\n\r\nConnecticut, and New York, have both made cessions, which congress has\r\naccepted. These two are therefore become interested.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, although very extensive, has her limits ascertained. She\r\nlikewise is interested.\r\n\r\nVirginia, having made a cession to congress, has since relinquished\r\na part of the reserved lands, or at least offered independence, to\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, having once made a cession, thought proper, in the\r\nomnipotence of her destined sovereignty, to repeal the act. Will not\r\nthe cession be determined valid, and the repeal void?\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina also, it is said, has ceded part of that territory,\r\nwhich lately she disputed with Georgia. In this case the United States\r\nhave their claim fortified.\r\n\r\nBut Georgia, the weakest of all, lays claim to an immense tract of\r\ncountry. In this territory there are warlike and independent tribes\r\nof the aborigines, now carrying terror and desolation towards the\r\nheart of the country occupied by the whites. It is expected, that\r\nthis circumstance, with a consciousness of the weak foundation of her\r\nclaims, will dispose Georgia to give up without a suit, and consent to\r\nbe circumscribed within narrower limits, so soon as a proper tribunal\r\nshall have power to enter upon a rational investigation.\r\n\r\nN. B.—For the above statement I am principally indebted to a member of\r\nthe late continental convention, and who for a considerable time, was a\r\nmember of congress, a gentleman of established honour and accuracy.\r\n\r\n(65) The advantage derived from this to the southern states, is easily\r\nperceived. Have not serious apprehensions been entertained on account\r\nof the vast superiority of the eastern states by sea?\r\n\r\n(65) Is it possible to reflect, without indignation, on the fate of the\r\nfive per cent. impost scheme?\r\n\r\n(66) This objection has been in some degree lessened, by an amendment,\r\noften before refused, and at last made by an erasure, after the\r\nengrossment upon parchment, of the word forty, and inserting thirty, in\r\nthe third clause of the second section of the first article.\r\n\r\n(67) It appears to me a very just remark of Mr. Wilson’s, in his\r\ncelebrated speech, that a bill of rights would have been dangerous, as\r\nimplying that without such a reservation the Congress would have had\r\nauthority in the cases enumerated, so that if any had been omitted (and\r\nwho would undertake to recite all the State and individual rights not\r\nrelinquished by the new Constitution?) they might have been considered\r\nat the mercy of the general legislature.\r\n\r\n(68) I have understood it was considered at the Convention, that the\r\nproportion of one Representative to 30,000 constituents, would produce\r\nat the very first nearly the number that would be satisfactory to Mr.\r\nMason. So that I presume this reason was wrote before the material\r\nalteration was made from 40,000 to 30,000, which is said to have taken\r\nplace the very last day just before the signature.\r\n\r\n(69) It seems by the letter which has been published of Mr. Elsworth\r\nand Mr. Sherman, as if one reason of giving a share in these\r\nappointments to the Senate was, that persons in what are called the\r\nlesser States might have an equal chance for such appointments, in\r\nproportion to their merit, with those in the larger, an advantage that\r\ncould only be expected from a body in which the States were equally\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n(70) When I wrote the above, I had not seen Governor Randolph’s letter.\r\nOtherwise, I have so great a respect for that gentleman’s character\r\nI should have treated with more deference an idea in some measure\r\ncountenanced by him. One of his objections relates to the Congress\r\nfixing their own salaries. I am persuaded, upon a little reflection,\r\nthat gentleman must think this is one of those cases where a trust\r\nmust unavoidably be reposed. No salaries could certainly be fixed now\r\nso as to answer the various changes in the value of money that in the\r\ncourse of time must take place. And in what condition would the supreme\r\nauthority be if their very existence depended on an inferior power! An\r\nabuse in this case too would be so gross that it is very unlikely to\r\nhappen, but if it should it would probably prove much more fatal to the\r\nauthors than injurious to the people.\r\n\r\n(71) See Coke’s Commentary upon Littleton, 110. 1. Blackstone’s\r\nCommentary, 227 and seq.\r\n\r\n(72) 1. Blackstone’s Commentaries, 232.\r\n\r\n(73) I have since found that in the constitutions of some of the States\r\nthere are much stronger restrictions on the Executive authority in\r\nthis particular than I was aware of. In others the restriction only\r\nextends to prosecutions carried on by the General Assembly, or the\r\nmost numerous branch of legislature, or a contrary provision by law;\r\nVirginia is in the latter class. But when we consider how necessary\r\nit is in many cases to make use of accomplices to convict their\r\nassociates, and what little regard ought in general to be paid to a\r\nguilty man swearing to save his own life, we shall probably think\r\nthat the jealousies which (by prohibiting pardons before convictions)\r\neven disabled the Executive authority from procuring unexceptionable\r\ntestimony of this sort, may more fairly be ascribed to the natural\r\nirritation of the public mind at the time when the constitutions were\r\nformed, than to an enlarged and full consideration of the subject.\r\nIndeed, it could scarcely be avoided, that when arms were first taken\r\nup in the cause of liberty, to save us from the immediate crush\r\nof arbitrary power, we should lean too much rather to the extreme\r\nof weakening than of strengthening the Executive power in our own\r\ngovernment. In England, the only restriction upon this power in the\r\nKing, in case of Crown prosecutions (one or two slight cases excepted)\r\nis, that his pardon is not pleadable in bar of an impeachment. But\r\nhe may pardon after conviction, even on an impeachment; which is an\r\nauthority not given to our President, who in case of impeachments has\r\nno power either of pardoning or reprieving.\r\n\r\n(74) The evidence of a man confessing himself guilty of the same crime\r\nis undoubtedly admissable, but it is generally, and ought to be always\r\nreceived with great suspicion, and other circumstances should be\r\nrequired to corroborate it.\r\n\r\n(75) One of the powers given to Congress is, “To promote the progress\r\nof science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors\r\nand inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and\r\ndiscoveries.” I am convinced Mr. Mason did not mean to refer to this\r\nclause. He is a gentleman of too much taste and knowledge himself\r\nto wish to have our government established upon such principles of\r\nbarbarism as to be able to afford no encouragement to genius.\r\n\r\n(76) Some might apprehend, that in this case as New England would at\r\nfirst have the greatest share of the carrying trade, the vessels of\r\nthat country might demand an unreasonable freight. But no attempt could\r\nbe more injurious to them as it would immediately set the Southern\r\nStates to building, which they could easily do, and thus a temporary\r\nloss would be compensated with a lasting advantage to us; the very\r\nreverse would be the case with them. Besides, that from that country\r\nalone there would probably be competition enough for freight to keep it\r\non reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n(77) If this provision had not been made in the new constitution no\r\nauthor could have enjoyed such an advantage in all the United States,\r\nunless a similar law had constantly subsisted in each of the States\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n(78) Those gentlemen who gravely tell us that the militia will be\r\nsufficient for this purpose, do not recollect that they themselves\r\ndo not desire we should rely solely on a militia in case of actual\r\nwar, and therefore in the case I have supposed they cannot be deemed\r\nsufficient even by themselves, for when the enemy landed it would\r\nundoubtedly be a time of war, but the misfortune would be, that they\r\nwould be prepared; we not. Certainly all possible encouragement should\r\nbe given to the training of our militia, but no man can really believe\r\nthat they will be sufficient, without the aid of any regular troops, in\r\ntime of foreign hostility. A powerful militia may make fewer regulars\r\nnecessary, but will not make it safe to dispense with them altogether.\r\n\r\n[79] I presume we are not to be deemed in a state of war whenever any\r\nIndian hostilities are committed on our frontiers. If that is the\r\ncase I don’t suppose we have had six years of peace since the first\r\nsettlement of the country, or shall have for fifty years to come. A\r\ndistinction between peace and war would be idle indeed, if it can be\r\nfrittered away by such pretences as those.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Charles Francis, 413.\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, cited, 316.\r\n\r\n  Adams.
