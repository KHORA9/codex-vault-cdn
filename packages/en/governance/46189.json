First, the toil-worn Craftsman\r\nthat with earth-made Implement laboriously conquers the Earth, and\r\nmakes her man's. Venerable to me is the hard Hand; crooked, coarse;\r\nwherein notwithstanding lies a cunning virtue, indefeasibly royal\r\nas of the Sceptre of this Planet. Venerable too is the rugged face,\r\nall weather-tanned, besoiled, with its rude intelligence; for it\r\nis the face of a Man living manlike. O, but the more venerable\r\nfor thy rudeness, and even because we must pity as well as love\r\nthee! Hardly-entreated Brother! For us was thy back so bent, for\r\nus were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed: thou wert our\r\nConscript, on whom the lot fell, and fighting our battles wert so\r\nmarred. For in thee too lay a god-created Form, but it was not to\r\nbe unfolded; encrusted must it stand with the thick adhesions and\r\ndefacements of Labour: and thy body, like thy soul, was not to know\r\nfreedom. Yet toil on, toil on: _thou_ art in thy duty, be out of it\r\nwho may; thou toilest for the altogether indispensable, for daily\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n\"A second man I honour, and still more highly: Him who is seen\r\ntoiling for the spiritually indispensable; not daily bread, but\r\nthe bread of Life. Is not he too in his duty; endeavouring towards\r\ninward Harmony; revealing this, by act or by word, through all\r\nhis outward endeavours, be they high or low? Highest of all, when\r\nhis outward and his inward endeavour are one: when we can name\r\nhim Artist; not earthly Craftsman only, but inspired Thinker, who\r\nwith heaven-made Implement conquers Heaven for us! If the poor and\r\nhumble toil that we have Food, must not the high and glorious toil\r\nfor him in return, that he have Light, have Guidance, Freedom,\r\nImmortality? These two, in all their degrees, I honour: all else is\r\nchaff and dust, which let the wind blow whither it listeth.\"\r\n\r\n                             THOMAS CARLYLE: _Sartor Resartus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"People who are old enough to write memoirs,\" says my friend Shane\r\nLeslie in _The End of a Chapter_, \"have usually lost their memory.\"\r\nThey have always, he might have added, lost the enthusiasm which\r\nonce inspired and is alone able to explain their part in what they\r\nare trying to remember. Going farther, he might have challenged in\r\nwords, as his book challenged by implication, the belief that there\r\nis any day in a man's life on which--though not an hour before--he\r\nis entitled to set down his reminiscences; yet one page from the\r\njournal of Alcibiades at twenty might well be more instructive than\r\nthree volumes of the wisdom of Socrates at seventy.\r\n\r\nMy reason for writing the present book is that I wish to record\r\ncertain impressions of a vanished generation while I remember\r\nthem clearly and sympathetically; my excuse for publishing it\r\nis that the opinions and recollections of middle life are so\r\nseldom articulate. Reminiscences of childhood, where they survive\r\nundimmed, find their place in fiction and in autobiography;\r\nreminiscences of youth and manhood, collected and chastened from\r\nthe sober angle of old age, are compressed into one patronising\r\nchapter of every standard life; but we are hardly ever allowed\r\nto look through the spectacles of thirty at the world as it\r\nappears to the eyes of thirty. Sometimes we are, indeed, admitted\r\nto the intimacy of a diary; but, if it has been composed with a\r\nview to publication, we may suspect that behind the pretext of\r\nself-communing the author is striking an attitude; if it was never\r\nintended for publication, we may wonder whether it should ever have\r\nbeen published. Possibly there is still room for recollections\r\nthat have frankly been written for publication before age has too\r\ngreatly blurred the outline of memory or distance eliminated too\r\nruthlessly the unimportant.\r\n\r\nAs the art of the novelist demands of him that he should first\r\nand foremost be a spectator of life, so the accident of race\r\nmakes of him an involuntary critic if his lot be cast amid alien\r\nsurroundings, however congenial; and the further accident of health\r\nnot always robust may remove him a yet greater distance from the\r\nactive life of his generation. In so far as this detachment gives\r\nhim a separate standard of comparison, it may be not without value\r\nin the review of past manners and ideals.\r\n\r\nIt is with the life of that generation and not with gossip\r\nabout this or that member of it that I am concerned. A new and\r\ninexcusable terror is added to social intercourse when the\r\nconfidence, the indiscretion or the malice of a dinner-table is\r\nindustriously recorded and published; and it is still believed\r\nby some who were trained in a tradition of reticence that\r\nintimate portraits and studies should be withheld so long as the\r\noriginals or their friends can be offended or hurt by unsought\r\npublicity. While a man of even thirty-three, spending most of his\r\nlife in London, may have met more than a few of the statesmen\r\nand financiers, the sailors and soldiers, the artists, authors\r\nand actors who have now chief place in the interest of their\r\ncountrymen, I feel that it would be impudent for him publicly to\r\nscatter his unsolicited opinion on those whom he has been invited\r\nto meet privately. This book will therefore be free from what has\r\nbeen called an \"index of improper names.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be no less impudent for him to assume that anyone is\r\ninterested in the insignificances of his private life. I venture\r\nto write of this epoch because I hope to present some aspects\r\nof it which might elude the historian who ranges over a wider\r\nfield, preeminently the aspect from the standpoint of youth. Any\r\nautobiographical matter deserves no more honourable place than a\r\nfootnote and is included only to explain how and why one super was\r\nfound at certain times on a certain stage.\r\n\r\nThe generation which ended with the Peace of Versailles in 1919 is\r\nlikely to be cut off from all that follows more completely than any\r\nof which we have record: a higher proportion of its youth has been\r\ndestroyed, and of those who remain hardly one has been left in the\r\nplace that he filled before the war; the standard and distribution\r\nof wealth have changed; and former lines of social demarcation have\r\nbeen obliterated. Though the old forms continue, the life that\r\ninspires them is new: the schools and universities, the learned\r\nprofessions and public services, the government itself are manned\r\nfrom a different class and actuated by different ideals. It may be\r\nnot altogether wasted labour to sketch a corner of that old world\r\nas it was known to the men who were reared in time to be sacrificed\r\nin the late war.\r\n\r\nImpelled by a common interest in changing fashions, Professor\r\nSir Denison Ross, Mr. Hugo Rumbold and I once agreed to compile\r\nan encyclopædia of the catch-words and cant phrases, the popular\r\nsongs and popular dances, the endearments and greetings of the\r\nlast twenty years; though the work has not yet been begun, I am\r\nnot without hope that there may be published in our lifetime\r\na social survey of England which shall contain some few of the\r\nthings commonly considered to be below the dignity of history,\r\nfor the change in manners during the last generation is worthy of\r\nan exhaustive treatise; it is at once the effect and the cause\r\nof a corresponding change in morals; and, whatever progress\r\nthe future have in store, those who first drew breath in Queen\r\nVictoria's reign may congratulate themselves, if it be a matter\r\nfor congratulation, on having passed in thirty years from the\r\ncivilisation of the Stone Age to that of the Cities of the Plain.\r\n\r\nThis book is as deliberately incomplete as the sketch-book of a\r\ntraveller who records some few of the scenes that he most wishes to\r\nconjure up again and none that he would prefer to forget. Whether\r\nmy reminiscences and reflections at thirty-three or at any other\r\nage are of interest to anyone I must leave my readers to determine,\r\ncomforting myself with the thought that the years through which\r\nI have lived are themselves of interest and reminding those who\r\nregard memoir-writing as a prerogative of septuagenarians that in\r\nthe life of most men there is a time when they are unable to look\r\nforward with confidence and must be deemed fortunate if they can\r\nlook back without regret.\r\n\r\nI have striven to avoid inaccuracy, but I have been compelled to\r\nwrite at a distance from all works of reference.\r\n\r\n                                                        S.

G. FRAZER: _The Golden Bough_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOn the last Sunday of July, in the year 1906, Little Dean's\r\nYard filled slowly with sixty or seventy boys in evening dress.\r\nAll but about ten wore the black gown, which is one mark of the\r\nWestminster Scholar, and, over the gown, a white surplice open\r\nor buttoned according to the seniority of the wearer. It was not\r\nyet ten o'clock in the morning; but on Election Sunday all King's\r\nScholars and Major Candidates appear in evening clothes, the Major\r\nCandidates distinguished by carnations of the prized Westminster\r\npink which has been worn since the day, nearly a hundred years\r\nago, when the school rowed against Eton and settled that colour\r\nquestion by trial of strength: the victors were to have pink, the\r\nvanquished blue; and the deeper pink of Leander derives from the\r\nWestminster founders of the club.\r\n\r\nThese were the last few flying moments of the last scene. Six years\r\nago the seniors in the swelling group, escaping from the thunder\r\nof traffic in Victoria Street and Broad Sanctuary, had entered\r\nthe silent backwater of Little Dean's Yard as Minor Candidates;\r\ntheir parents or the masters of their preparatory schools led\r\nthem under the arch and past the fives' courts; they turned shyly\r\nwondering eyes at Home Boarders, Rigaud's, Grant's, College and\r\nAshburnham, at the Bursary and the head master's house; then they\r\nwere shepherded through the Inigo Jones doorway and up the steps\r\ninto School. It was the first day of the Challenge, wherein the\r\ncandidates of other days met all-comers in a disputation--lasting a\r\nweek or more--on the elements of learning and those who outlasted\r\ntheir opponents were elected to scholarships. Now, after six years,\r\nthey were competing for the close scholarships and exhibitions at\r\nChrist Church and at Trinity, Cambridge. The written work was over;\r\non Election Monday would come the _viva voce_, then the annual\r\ncricket match between the King's Scholars and the Town Boys on\r\nVincent Square, then Election dinner in College Hall enlivened by\r\nthe Greek, Latin and English epigrams which Westminster subsidises;\r\nthen on Election Tuesday, still in evening dress, they would attend\r\nthe school service in Abbey for the last time and for the last time\r\nanswer \"_Adsum_\" at roll-call; the results of Election would be\r\nread out, the prizes distributed, the office-holders would divest\r\nthemselves of office and they would walk down School for the last\r\ntime, into their houses, out of them again and into the world.\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the King's Scholars came out of College; the Head\r\nTown Boy joined him at the entrance to the cloisters; next to them\r\nwere the other two School Monitors. The involuntary began; and the\r\nprocession passed through the nave and under the organ loft: first\r\nthe choir, then the Abbey clergy and the Dean of Westminster; the\r\nDean of Christ Church and the Master of Trinity; the examiners from\r\nOxford and Cambridge; the Head Master of Westminster; the assistant\r\nmasters in gowns and hoods; the King's Scholars in surplices, gowns\r\nand evening dress, those of them who were leaving chastened by the\r\nthought that, after the Election Tuesday service two days later,\r\nthey would enter the Abbey as members of the public only.\r\n\r\nWestminster is so much the embodiment and shrine of English history\r\nthat even the alien and the iconoclast cannot spend six years in\r\nthe shadow of the Abbey without becoming steeped in the spirit and\r\nassociations of the place. It is the influence of such foundations\r\nthat makes of English life its present compromise between the\r\nrational and the traditional. From their places in the stalls\r\ncould be seen the arches of the triforium which are filled at\r\ncoronations by the Westminster Scholars: no king, they assert, can\r\nbe duly crowned unless he is acclaimed by their triple shout of\r\n\"_Vivat Rex_\". It is their privilege to be present in Palace Yard\r\nwhen the soveran opens Parliament; Scholars and Town Boys walk,\r\nof unchallenged right, into the gallery of the House of Commons,\r\nScholars--in cap and gown--into the gallery of the House of Lords\r\nand, on Sundays, on to the Terrace; when the Courts of Justice\r\nwere at Westminster, they could wander unchecked into Westminster\r\nHall. Their daily service takes place in the Poets' Corner; they\r\nare present at State funerals, their confirmation is held in Henry\r\nVII's chapel; and the whole Abbey is their heritage. Is not the\r\nschool descended lineally from that group of lay scholars whom the\r\nmonks of Westminster taught? Is not the monks' dormitory their\r\nGreat School? Among the documents discovered of late years in the\r\nAbbey Muniment Room is a record, under the year 1284, of _expensæ_,\r\nbeing provision for the teaching of scholars, and a further record,\r\nunder the year 1339, of payments for \"Westminster School.\" Already\r\nold when Winchester and Eton were founded, with its roots struck\r\ndeep in the Abbey's earliest history and with its life immemorially\r\nintertwined with the life of the Abbey, the two have remained side\r\nby side until Westminster is the last of the London schools to\r\nresist the pressure which has already urged younger rivals from\r\ntheir seats. Changing slowly with the slow unfolding of English\r\nhistory, the school was refounded by Queen Elizabeth on a secular\r\nfooting; and the monitor of the week, kneeling with his back to\r\nBusby's birch-table[1] and facing the school, returns thanks \"_pro\r\nfundatrice nostra Regina Elizabetha_\" on the spot where Robert\r\nSouth prayed \"_pro rege Carolo_\" on the 30th of January, 1649. It\r\nretains, by the Act of Uniformity, its \"almost unique privilege of\r\nusing Latin in religious offices\", though--as a concession to the\r\nReformers--the monkish pronunciation was abandoned for that which\r\nwas the universal English form until misguided empiricists set\r\nup confusion where none existed before by introducing a \"modern\"\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nSince that new Tower of Babel was erected, Westminster has watched\r\nother foundations arguing and striving to discover the correct\r\npronunciation of classical Latin. Despite the periodical rebukes\r\nof its rivals, it has held stubbornly to its course, knowing\r\nthat there is no sure means of recreating the speech of Cicero\r\nand that Westminster at least is too deeply bedded in the past\r\nto bend before each new breeze of educational fashion. A hundred\r\ncustoms are preserved to teach new generations that progress need\r\nnot be divorced from the historic sense: when the bell rings for\r\nprayers at the end of afternoon school, a Second Election knocks\r\nwith his cap at the doors of the form-rooms adjoining school and\r\ncalls out, \"_Instat quinta_\", or, on \"plays\" (half-holidays),\r\n\"_Instat sesquiduodecima_\", although the actual hour is now nearly\r\none o'clock; a Second Election has knocked thus since the time\r\nwas told from a single clock and shouted through the school by a\r\njunior; before prayers begin, the doors are locked, and, when they\r\nare opened, one of the School Monitors[2] mounts guard outside to\r\nrepel a chance raid by the \"sci's\"[3] of the neighbourhood who in\r\nless orderly days carried on a town-and-gown warfare against the\r\nschool. At the lowest, such customs are a picturesque survival,\r\nlike the Latin play acted in College Dormitory, the Pancake Greeze\r\non Shrove Tuesday, the countless phrases and customs which only a\r\nWestminster understands and which all Westminsters love; perhaps,\r\ntoo, they foster, in the alien and the iconoclast, a sense of the\r\npast. Abbey and School are a monument to continuity and ordered\r\nprogress; in 1906, they were a monument at which the leaving\r\nseniors had been involuntarily staring for half a dozen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt is probable that few of them had much attention to spare for\r\nthe sermon on that Election Sunday. At eighteen they had spent a\r\nthird of their life at Westminster; it is a foundation in which\r\nson succeeds father and brother follows brother, as witness the\r\ncarved and painted names of Madans and Waterfields, Goodenoughs and\r\nPhillimores up School, and on a September night of 1900 tradition\r\nhad set them in the footsteps of their families and had sought a\r\nplace for them in the old houses, there to serve and perhaps to\r\nsuffer, to learn and, later, to rule.\r\n\r\n\"You will sometimes be punished when you do not deserve it\", was\r\nthe wise parting advice of one preparatory-school headmaster;\r\n\"before giving vent to your indignation, reflect how much oftener\r\nyou have deserved punishment without receiving it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to say that this consoling philosophy was little\r\nrequired at Westminster: provided that he incurred no suspicion\r\nof \"side\", there was so general a disposition to help the strange\r\nnewcomer that he suffered little; and even his service was\r\nmade easy for him. The \"shadow\", in Westminster language, was\r\ninstructed at once in the rules and customs of the house by a\r\nsenior fag, his \"substance\", who shouldered his sins for the first\r\nfortnight and was theoretically liable to suffer vicariously\r\nfor his shortcomings; after the days of grace a new boy could\r\nbe fagged, though this involved little more than fetching and\r\ncarrying, washing cups, filling saucepans and preparing call-over\r\nlists; he could also be \"tanned\", with an instrument appropriately\r\ndesignated a \"pole\"; but, though this was less agreeable, corporal\r\npunishment was not employed with undue frequency. There was always\r\na right of appeal, too, with the menace of two extra strokes if the\r\nappeal was dismissed; but, as it was a point of honour never to\r\nappeal, the sufferer could only comfort himself with the thought\r\nthat a tanning was over more quickly than \"lines\" or \"drill\" and\r\nwith the hope that he might fall into weak or inexpert hands. Of\r\nbullying there was little; of systematic oppression and torture\r\nof the weak by the strong there was none at all, though the small\r\nboys of that generation (as of every other) believed that, if a\r\ncompanion was offensive, their right and duty impelled them to drum\r\nthe offensiveness out of him.\r\n\r\nThe war has caused the English people to examine searchingly its\r\nscheme of education and especially that public-school system\r\nwhich trains the sons of the well-to-do for future eminence in\r\ngovernment, the public services and the learned professions.\r\nThere have been many books and much discussion: the English love\r\nof finding fault with cherished institutions while approving the\r\nresult has led to a hazy belief that the English public-schoolboy\r\nis the finest raw material in the world, but that only his inborn\r\nsuperiority has saved him from destruction by a burthen of useless\r\nlearning, devastating ignorance, insane athleticism and vicious\r\nassociations. It is more than time to suggest that his excellence\r\nis a delicate bloom nurtured and saved by the public school from\r\nthe criminal neglect of his parents and that most critics, failing\r\nto distinguish between the phases through which every boy passes,\r\nhave written down as chronic disease what was but temporary\r\ngreen-sickness.\r\n\r\nFew men can speak with knowledge of more than one school, but\r\nthere is little risk in the assertion that the natural history of\r\nthe public-schoolboy is broadly the same at all times and places.\r\nWithdrawn at an early age from the dry-nursing of his natural\r\nguardians, he is flung into a vast adolescent society and left to\r\nstruggle through as best he may: his parents commonly escape the\r\nembarrassment of explaining to him the elements of physiology,\r\npreferring that he should learn them from the gloating confidences\r\nof other boys hardly less ignorant than himself. Native chastity\r\nof soul keeps some unsmirched, but most go through an ugly period\r\nof foul tongues, foul minds and sometimes foul propensities which\r\nthe school seeks to circumvent by vigilance and hard physical\r\ndiscipline. During the middle phase, this blind, misunderstood\r\ngroping towards maturity comes to be gradually controlled; and, in\r\nthe last, the adult boy is seen as a clean-living, clean-speaking,\r\nrather solemn blend of scholar, sportsman and despot, very\r\nconscious of his responsibilities and zealous to repress the\r\nprimitive exuberance by which he himself was afflicted two or three\r\nyears earlier.\r\n\r\nBefore public schools are denounced for making boys licentious of\r\nhabit and obscene of tongue, parents might ask themselves what\r\npreventive measures they themselves have taken. And, before any\r\none attacks the insistence on athletics in public schools, he\r\nmight ask himself what better physical discipline he can propose\r\nand whether this derided love of sport is inculcated at school or\r\nat home. If a boy were not compelled by fear of punishment to take\r\npart in games, he would be coerced by the opinion of parents who\r\nwould not understand nor tolerate a son without the Englishman's\r\nnormal and natural preoccupation with sport; and, though compulsory\r\ngames are easy to ridicule, they do not kill the chivalry of good\r\nsportsmanship: an early Westminster memory is of a football shield\r\npassing, after long and honourable contest, from one house to\r\nanother; while the head and captain of the winning house fetched\r\naway the trophy, the losing house lined up to cheer their victors\r\nand, if possible, to drown the cheers of the winning house for the\r\none that had lost.\r\n\r\nA defence of the public-school system would deserve at least as\r\nmuch space as the critics have given to attacking it. This is\r\nneither the place nor time to engage in the endless controversy;\r\nit was not the place nor time, fifteen years ago, for any who sat\r\nthinking of their own school and of the days that they had spent\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMany of those who were leaving must have wondered where the\r\noutgoing draft would be in another six years' time. Westminster\r\ncontains about three hundred boys, drawn chiefly from the\r\nprofessional classes, and in turn sends a steady stream of recruits\r\nto the civil service and the learned professions. Barristers and\r\ndoctors abound; government servants are to be discovered richly\r\ndistributed through Whitehall, India and the colonies; the school\r\nhas its share of clergymen and more than its share of soldiers.\r\nIn less than six years all would have come down from Oxford\r\nand Cambridge, unless any had had the good fortune to secure a\r\nfellowship; and, while those who were destined for a profession had\r\nalready decided on their careers, those who dreamed of public life\r\nand looked, perhaps, towards the north transept where, in white\r\nmarble and late-won peace, Beaconsfield and Gladstone stood side\r\nby side, may have preferred to keep locked in their own hearts the\r\nideals which they had diffidently set before themselves.\r\n\r\nThe changing and strengthening aspirations of a boy have won as\r\nlittle space in all the crop of analytical school literature as\r\nhave the vagaries of his religious faith or the evolution of\r\nhis civic morals. The Victorians, indeed, in strict accordance\r\nwith formula, loaded their hero with vague disquiet which was\r\nonly relieved when he recalled that he had ceased to receive\r\nthe sacraments; a later generation arrested him in full flight\r\nto perdition by intervening opportunely with a soul-steadying\r\npreparation for confirmation; the Catholic propagandists habitually\r\nthrew a sympathetic priest across his path in the course of a\r\nholiday ramble; and, if there be a school literature of dissent, I\r\ndoubt not but that some harassed hero found peace in the practice\r\nof Congregationalism. It was recognised, therefore, that the\r\nfaith of childhood is not infrequently discarded at school; it\r\nwas assumed with less justification that boys undergo spiritual\r\ndistress at such a time; and, as the hero of a novel is not\r\nexpected to suffer as long or as acutely as any one in life, one\r\nor other of the conventional escapes could always be chosen. It\r\nis hard to remember a book in which the hero sheds his belief\r\nin super-natural religion as lightheartedly as once he outgrew\r\nhis faith in Santa Claus; and, even if it be assumed from private\r\nknowledge and experience that many schoolboy heroes have passed\r\nthrough this spiritual transformation, it is harder to recall even\r\none who has been described as constructing a new system to take the\r\nplace of that which has been overthrown.\r\n\r\nThis reconstruction, nevertheless, was being attempted twenty\r\nyears ago, in the aftermath of the higher criticism, by all boys\r\nwith a speculative bent of mind; they were distinguished from\r\ntheir predecessors by inherited scepticism; and their natural\r\nhistory, to venture once more on a generalization from admittedly\r\nincomplete data, was roughly the same everywhere in England.\r\nWere it reasonable to fancy for a moment that modern boys were\r\ndistressed when their faith left them, severe blame would attach\r\nto the timorous, indolent or dishonest parents who shirk the\r\nburden of explaining and who teach as truth what they themselves\r\nbelieve to be untrue, hoping that, when their children are older,\r\nthey will somehow have learned better at the hands of masters,\r\nwho are debarred from religious controversy, or of boys, who can\r\nonly contribute an equal ignorance. In fact, the boy who lost his\r\nfaith in revealed religion lost it more slowly, but no whit more\r\npainfully than his belief in fairies; he no longer wrote to his\r\nfellows, as Gladstone and Manning would write, to discuss the\r\nstate of his soul; he sought no spiritual director and asked no\r\none to pray for him, though he may have wondered why his parents\r\npreserved a grotesque imposture for so long. In reading and in\r\ndiscussion he had absorbed ideas of biological evolution, of\r\ngeological testimony and of religion studied comparatively; he\r\napplied to historical Christianity the tests which he had been\r\ntaught to use on the history of Greece and Rome, accepting nothing\r\nthat could not be proved by evidence and rejecting the pretensions\r\nof faith as he rejected the statements of a secular historian\r\nthat his history was literally inspired. Already he had heard\r\nthat the Old Testament was no longer accepted as heretofore; he\r\nmay even have learned that, for thousands of years before Christ,\r\ncountless gods were sacrificed annually by crucifixion or other\r\nmeans and that a Barabbas was annually released to the people;\r\nthe distillation continued until he was left with the residuum\r\nthat a man named Jesus Christ, claiming or having claimed for him\r\na divine fatherhood, was crucified after a short life of healing\r\nand teaching; there were, he found, no independent contemporary\r\ndocuments, and the fullest accounts, written many years after\r\nthe events they described, were inspired by the devotion of his\r\nfollowers, whose critical judgement, however, was on a level of\r\neducation to be expected in one harassed and turbulent corner of\r\nthe Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe concluding passage from _The Golden Bough_, of which a few\r\nwords have been quoted at the beginning of this chapter, defines,\r\nin prose of rare beauty, the attitude of an agnostic towards\r\nChristianity. \"A man,\" wrote Sir James Frazer, \"whom the fond\r\nimagination of his worshippers invested with the attributes of a\r\ngod, gave his life for the life of the world; after infusing from\r\nhis own body a fresh current of vital energy into the stagnant\r\nveins of nature, he was cut off from among the living before his\r\nfailing strength should initiate a universal decay, and his place\r\nwas taken by another who played, like all his predecessors, the\r\never-recurring drama of the divine resurrection and death.... It\r\nwas played in Babylonia, and from Babylonia the returning captives\r\nbrought it to Judæa, where it was acted, rather as an historical\r\nthan a mythical piece, by players who, having to die in grim\r\nearnest on a cross or gallows, were naturally drawn rather from\r\nthe gaol than the green-room. A chain of causes which, because we\r\ncannot follow them, might in the loose language of daily life be\r\ncalled an accident, determined that the part of the dying god in\r\nthis annual play should be thrust upon Jesus of Nazareth, whom the\r\nenemies he had made in high places by his outspoken strictures\r\nwere resolved to put out of the way. They succeeded in ridding\r\nthemselves of the popular and troublesome preacher; but the very\r\nstep by which they fancied they had simultaneously stamped out his\r\nrevolutionary doctrines contributed more than anything else they\r\ncould have done to scatter them broadcast not only over Judæa but\r\nover Asia; for it impressed upon what had been hitherto mainly an\r\nethical mission the character of a divine revelation culminating in\r\nthe passion and death of the incarnate Son of a heavenly Father.\r\nIn this form the story of the life and death of Jesus exerted an\r\ninfluence which it could never have had if the great teacher had\r\ndied, as is commonly supposed, the death of a vulgar malefactor. It\r\nshed round the cross on Calvary a halo of divinity which multitudes\r\nsaw and worshipped afar off; the blow struck on Golgotha set a\r\nthousand expectant strings vibrating in unison wherever men had\r\nheard the old, old story of the dying and risen god. Every year, as\r\nanother spring bloomed and another autumn faded across the earth,\r\nthe field had been ploughed and sown and borne fruit of a kind\r\ntill it received that seed which was destined to spring up and\r\novershadow the world. In the great army of martyrs who in many ages\r\nand in many lands, not in Asia only, have died a cruel death in\r\nthe character of gods, the devout Christian will doubtless discern\r\ntypes and forerunners of the coming Saviour--stars that heralded\r\nin the morning sky the advent of the Sun of Righteousness--earthen\r\nvessels wherein it pleased the divine wisdom to set before\r\nhungering souls the bread of heaven. The sceptic, on the other\r\nhand, with equal confidence, will reduce Jesus of Nazareth to the\r\nlevel of a multitude of other victims of a barbarous superstition,\r\nand will see in him no more than a moral teacher whom the fortunate\r\naccident of his execution invested with the crown, not merely of a\r\nmartyr, but of a god. The divergence between these views is wide\r\nand deep. Which of them is the truer and will in the end prevail?\r\nTime will decide the question of prevalence, if not of truth. Yet\r\nwe would fain believe that in this and in all things the old maxim\r\nwill hold good--_Magna est veritas et prævalebit_.\"\r\n\r\nThe sceptics of the last Victorian decade left school as agnostics;\r\nof their number, the more reflective set themselves to fill the\r\nvacuum. As a boy, with a prospect of life too long to measure,\r\nhas an equal distaste for the sentimentality of heaven and for\r\nthe melodrama of hell, he probably concerned himself little with\r\nthe condition that he could only attain eternal life by believing\r\nin the divinity of Christ. Scepticism may have forced him to\r\ndoubt whether eternity was intelligible and to be certain that it\r\nwas undesirable; but his knowledge of history and his taste for\r\nspeculative enquiry suggested that eternity in another existence\r\nmight be less important than the conditions on which his present\r\nexistence was carried on: the ethics of Christianity were more\r\nvaluable, in his eyes, than its dogma.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the reconstruction commonly began, with the\r\nquestion: \"If there be no God, no eternal life, no reward for\r\nvirtue, nor punishment for evil, why should any one strive after\r\ngodliness? The policeman, indeed, watches for a breach of the\r\ncivil law, but only a fool would clothe the naked or feed the\r\nhungry without thought of reward. Hitherto this was said to be\r\n'right', 'charitable', 'kind'; but why _should_ any one be kind or\r\ncharitable?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of history was that every member of every community\r\ngained in security and comfort by the comfort and security of the\r\ncommunity and that none was tolerable in which fear and injustice,\r\nwant and cruelty were permitted; in his own interest every man must\r\nstrive to eradicate them, for the other members were his daily\r\nneighbours. Side by side with the teaching of the biologists, who\r\ndestroyed with their theory of evolution the belief in a special\r\ncreation, there came into the common stock of ideas the teaching\r\nof the utilitarians, who offered a new criterion for private and\r\npublic conduct. While Christian dogma might be an obsolete shortcut\r\nto an eternity which few desired and fewer still could contemplate,\r\nChristian ethics remained the noblest and gentlest counsel to\r\nperfection. At length reconstruction found itself back at the\r\ninjunction that a man should love his neighbour as himself.\r\n\r\nEach with his own formula, the young agnostics of the last\r\ngeneration worked by discussion, reading and reflection to a new\r\nimperative; and those who found satisfaction in Christian ethics\r\nas a guide to conduct found also that the Christianity which they\r\nhad fashioned for themselves was a militant faith. Injustice and\r\nfear, suffering and cruelty are not to be eradicated by private\r\nrenunciations and protests; those who care enough for beauty to\r\nwish the world beautiful have to make the world beautiful. And the\r\nmachine in which the form of the world is changed seemed in those\r\ndays to be politics.[4]\r\n\r\nVast as had been the progress of recorded history, vaster progress\r\nremained to be accomplished if civilisation was not to be judged an\r\nhypocrisy or a failure; and, though the saddest limitation of youth\r\nbe its utter misunderstanding of the obstacles in the way of any\r\nchange, its most glorious endowment is surely its impulsive desire\r\nto realise its ideals. Impatient of muddle, intolerant of laziness,\r\nsensitive to beauty and fiercely sympathetic with suffering, youth\r\nglances with disgust at the meanness and squalor that desecrate\r\nevery part of its world and offers the generous ardour of a\r\nworld-builder to set it right. Childhood with its wooden blocks and\r\nsand-castles, boyhood with its tools and engines, youth with its\r\ninstruments and diagrams are the constructive times of life: there\r\nis little that lusty youth will not make, nothing that impatient\r\nyouth is afraid to reform; its heroes are the great conquerors\r\nand builders who tidied some corner of a dilapidated world, the\r\nexplorers who sought new worlds to tidy, even the prophets and\r\nlawyers who tried to bring uniformity into religion and society.\r\n\r\nIn a thousand hours of meditation or wrangling the boys of that\r\ngeneration hammered out each his own formula of political change.\r\nThe ethics of private property and communism, of war and peace,\r\nof equal democracy and paternal despotism, of the national ideal\r\nand the ideal of internationalism were argued at school from the\r\nstandpoint which had been taken up at home and at home from a\r\nstandpoint which had been startlingly occupied at school. Whatever\r\nhad been the inherited preconceptions, every political doctrine\r\nwas now required to justify itself: the party which had enjoyed\r\nalmost unbroken tenure of office for nearly a fifth of a century\r\nfell from power in 1905, to be succeeded by one which brought up\r\nfor settlement or readjustment all the old problems of domestic\r\ncontroversy and many that were new.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt is easy to guess the political path chosen by an Irish boy\r\nbrought up in England and sent to a tory stronghold by a father\r\nwho had reared him on the pure milk of late-Victorian radicalism;\r\nit is not difficult to imagine what lions beset that path. The\r\nway of the minority politician in a public school is hard but\r\nstimulating: while the Boer war continued, any doubts of British\r\nwisdom or justice in South Africa were ill-received and answered by\r\nviolence; for two years more, since free trade had been abandoned\r\nby Mr. Chamberlain, a solitary free-trader would be beaten to\r\nhis knees by phrases about dying industries, dumping and unfair\r\ncompetition; and, all the while, there was little chance of\r\nagreement between those who would have solved the Irish difficulty\r\nby holding Ireland under the sea for five minutes and any one who\r\nwas never able to forget the sailing of crowded emigrant ships from\r\nQueenstown and the keening which rose to Heaven in acknowledgment\r\nof British rule.\r\n\r\nOnly in the dignified atmosphere of the Debating Society, when a\r\ngeneral election had sent hundreds of radicals to Parliament and\r\nproved that radicals existed, in hundreds of thousands, outside\r\nit, did radical policy get a hearing. Political interest revived\r\nsharply in 1905 and 1906: more than ever did the rising politicians\r\nuse their privilege of attending debates in the House of Commons.\r\nIt has been said that politics are made tolerable in England by\r\nthe fact that hardly any one takes them seriously except the\r\npoliticians, who are for the most part not English; but they are\r\ndangerous food for the young in the expectations that they arouse\r\nand in the disillusionment that they entail. After nearly twenty\r\nyears of tory rule, the liberals in 1905 were healed of their long\r\ndomestic dissensions and assured of a majority; the ministry so\r\njudiciously chosen by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was overwhelming\r\nin its varied strength; with the pacification of South Africa\r\nand the repatriation of the indentured Chinese labourers, the\r\ndark infamy of the Boer war and of a calamitous plunge into Rand\r\npolitics were to be forgotten; social reform was sketched with a\r\nbold hand; a message of peace and good-will was sent to the other\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nSo vast was the ministerial majority after the election of 1906\r\nthat a liberal prime minister, for the first time since 1880,\r\nseemed able to fulfil his promises without having to balance the\r\nclaims of ill-assorted groups or to consider the vague menace of\r\nthe House of Lords; the ambitions of the Liberal League had been\r\ndefeated, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had survived the efforts\r\nof his more spirited colleagues to kick him upstairs. In 1906,\r\nfor those who cared to see the world beautiful and would spend\r\ntheir ardour to make it beautiful, there was still a sufficient\r\npart of the population illiterate, hungry and diseased, rendered\r\nmiserable by fear and savage by injustice to keep the social\r\nreformers employed; Ireland, Egypt and India all demanded a change\r\nof administrative system. Those were days in which it seemed good\r\nto be a liberal.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt would have been a meagre tribute to the spell of Westminster\r\nif some of those who, in passing out of Abbey on that last Sunday\r\nof Election Term, passed also out of their pupilage, did not look\r\nforward from the threshold of manhood in a spirit of dedication; it\r\nwould have been an admission of dubious gratitude if, in bidding\r\nfarewell that afternoon under the trees of College Garden, they\r\nhad not confessed their debt to the school. In six years some few\r\nof them had developed into fair scholars along lines of education\r\nwhich had not then been so bitterly attacked as they have been\r\nsince: no one, indeed, aimed to make them proficient in preparing a\r\nmanifest and detecting an escape of sewer gas; in their curriculum\r\nthe financial possibilities of Spanish and Russian were ignored,\r\nlike all other adjuncts to a sound commercial training; and, though\r\nthe art of Asia and the letters of Ethiopia have since been urged\r\nas an alternative to Greek and Latin, they stuck insularly to the\r\nliterature and history of the civilisation from which all the great\r\nmodern civilisations of Europe derive. Those who cared to work\r\ncontrived to cover a wide field even in that English literature\r\nwhich is popularly thought to be excluded from public-school study;\r\nfor the rest, it should be recognised that a point is quickly\r\nreached at which those who do not wish to work can no longer be\r\ncompelled. At the lowest computation, all had received at least a\r\ngrounding in the humanities and an equipment for profounder study\r\nof subjects that by pressure of time could not be exhausted at\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they were for five or six years disciplined to a\r\nsystem, yielding obedience as unquestioningly as afterwards they\r\nexacted it.\r\n\r\n  \"This we learned from famous men,\r\n      Knowing not its uses,\r\n  When they showed, in daily work,\r\n  Man must finish off his work--\r\n  Right or wrong, his daily work--\r\n      And without excuses....\r\n\r\n  This we learned from famous men\r\n      Teaching in our borders,\r\n  Who declared it was best,\r\n  Safest, easiest, and best--\r\n  Expeditious, wise and best--\r\n      To obey your orders.\r\n\r\n  Some beneath the further stars\r\n      Bear the greater burden:\r\n  Set to serve the lands they rule,\r\n  (Save he serve no man may rule),\r\n  Serve and love the lands they rule;\r\n      Seeking praise nor guerdon....\"\r\n\r\nThey learned initiative and responsibility; they were trained to\r\nsubordinate the individual to the community; and they acquired\r\na code which at its worst was limited and foolish, at its best\r\nexalted and honourable. If the panorama of a public school has\r\nits ugly patches, so has the panorama of life; if the prejudices\r\nwere many, they were fewer than the prejudices encountered on\r\nleaving school; if the honour was circumscribed, its boundaries\r\nwere reached perhaps less quickly than the boundaries of honour\r\nin later life. The convention that there is at best an armed\r\nneutrality between boy and master leads the boy to a diplomatic\r\neconomy of truth not always distinguishable from disingenuousness;\r\nin his dealings with seniors, contemporaries and juniors he is\r\nhonest, truthful and substantially just. As he is taught to accept\r\nundeserved punishment without complaining, so he learns to avow the\r\nundetected misdeeds by which a fellow might suffer; never to fail\r\nthe team, the house, the school or a single friend, always to hide\r\nemotion and to be in hard physical condition may be crude social\r\nethics, but they are neither unworthy nor fruitless in their effect\r\non public life. Twenty years ago it would have been unnecessary\r\nto put forward these claims, but the querulous aftermath of the\r\nwar has involved the public schools in ill-defined suspicion; yet\r\nthe leader of a crusade would find no more ardent, generous and\r\nupright spirits than in old British public-schoolboys of seventeen\r\nto twenty-two; and, before the worldling discharges his gibes at\r\ntheir honour and their code, he might stay to reflect whether the\r\nadministration of empire, as carried out in two hemispheres by the\r\nsons of these long-suffering schools, must yield pride of place,\r\nfor integrity and devotion, to the public services of Germany\r\nand France, Italy and Spain, America and Japan, whether, too, the\r\nscandals and treacheries which have broken the monotony of English\r\npublic life in the last ten years are due to excess of these\r\nderided qualities or to want of them.\r\n\r\nIf, on the last Sunday, many lacked the detachment to set out in\r\ndetail their debt to Westminster, all could acknowledge their love\r\nand treasure their last moments. Next morning the Major Candidates\r\nwere imprisoned in a form-room leading to School and summoned\r\none by one to stand before a long table for the _viva voce_\r\nexamination. There followed the match between the King's Scholars\r\nand the Town Boys. Next morning those who were leaving rose and for\r\nthe last time put on dress clothes and a gown for their last day at\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nAfter the breaking-up service in the Abbey, they assembled in\r\nSchool for call-over. The results of Election and the removes were\r\nread out, the prizes distributed, the prize epigrams recited by\r\ntheir authors and rewarded with one of the silver pennies that\r\ncome to Westminster in the distribution of the Maundy. Armed with\r\na birch (\"rod\"), one of the School Monitors was despatched down\r\nthe gangway between the lower forms to find and escort to the\r\nhead master's dais a young offender who paid for his too frequent\r\npresence in penal drill by being publicly flicked across the back\r\nof the hand. Then the Captain and three School Monitors stood up\r\nand in turn were handed the birch which they reversed and gave back\r\nto the head master; as soon as they had been discharged of their\r\ndignity and duties, the new School Monitors were handed the birch\r\nin token of office. At the \"_Oremus_\" the new Captain knelt facing\r\nthe school and read the Latin prayers; with the \"_Ire licet_\" was\r\nborn a new generation of Old Westminsters.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with the Dean of Christ Church, those who had been\r\nelected to the House were told the day on which they had to present\r\nthemselves in Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA SETTING AND A DATE\r\n\r\n \"I am the captive of your bow and spear, sir. The position\r\n has its obligations--on both sides.... Brainy men languishing\r\n under an effete system which, when you take good holt of it, is\r\n England--just all England.... If you want to realise your assets,\r\n you should lease the whole proposition to America for ninety-nine\r\n years.\"\r\n\r\n                                   RUDYARD KIPLING: _The Captive_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe men who in 1914 were of military age, as that definition was\r\nused on the outbreak of war, were born at earliest in the middle\r\nof the eighties. Queen Victoria was to reign for half a generation\r\nlonger, Lord Beaconsfield was but lately dead, Mr. Gladstone had\r\nahead of him more than a dozen years of life and one more term as\r\nprime minister, and Mr. Parnell was appearing for the first time as\r\nthe maker and breaker of ministries.\r\n\r\nAbroad, Prince Bismarck was still chancellor to the Emperor\r\nWilliam I, and the third French Republic was young enough to be\r\nstill unsteady on its legs; but, since British fears of Russian\r\naggression had been for the most part interred with the bones of\r\nDisraeli's spirited foreign policy, the chief imperial problems\r\nrelated to the yet new British responsibility for Egypt and to\r\nborder wars and punitive expeditions on the fringe of empire.\r\nAt home, the conservatives, wagged by the tail of the \"fourth\r\nparty,\" were coming to terms with the liberal-unionists who had\r\nseceded from Mr. Gladstone in 1886; the liberal party, committed\r\nto home rule as a first charge, unless the findings of the Parnell\r\ncommission should discredit its policy, was shelving the rest of\r\nits programme and secretly waiting for its leader's death in order\r\nto infuse a stronger radicalism than was palatable in the lifetime\r\nof a man who had first held office under Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nOn either side of either house, as on either side of the Irish Sea,\r\nthe dominant political problem from 1885 to 1895 was the problem\r\nof Irish self-government: on this old parties were split and new\r\nparties formed; from this proceeded the policies and controversies\r\nwhich filled the life of Parliament to the exclusion of almost\r\neverything else for the twenty years from 1895 to the great war.\r\nIn the first home rule bill and the liberal defeat of 1886, in the\r\nParnell commission and the second home rule bill, in the Parnell\r\ndivorce and the defeat of Mr. Gladstone's last administration, in\r\nthe constitutional struggle between Lords and Commons from 1893\r\nto 1911, in the Wyndham land legislation, the devolution scheme\r\nand the fall of Mr. Wyndham, in the Irish councils bill, the\r\nthird home rule bill, the threat of rebellion and the outbreak of\r\ncivil war, English political history lay under the sable shadow\r\nof Ireland, English political interests and developments were\r\nsacrificed to Irish demands, and English political parties, jointly\r\nand severally, one after another, paid for their failure to give\r\nIreland an acceptable form of self-government.\r\n\r\nThough an Irishman brought up in England may lose the faith, the\r\nspeech and the nationality of the one country without acquiring\r\nthose of the other, he will inevitably be forced into an\r\nalternating sympathy with both; and, while he may hesitate to\r\nexplain the English to the Irish or the Irish to the English, he is\r\nbound, by any affection that he may feel for either, to disperse by\r\nany means in his power the cloud of tragic misunderstanding which\r\nhas for so long poisoned the life of both. It was said, in seeming\r\nparadox, at a time of diplomatic tension between Great Britain and\r\nthe United States, that both countries laboured equally under the\r\ncurse of a common language; and at all times, unless the same words\r\nembody the same ideas to both disputants, they will encounter less\r\nconfusion by translating, however cumbrously, from one language to\r\nanother. When an American says \"gotten\", he means \"gotten\"; but an\r\nEnglishman is too ready to imagine that he meant to say \"got\", but\r\nunhappily knew no better--until, perhaps, set right. Similarly, a\r\nfull half of the immemorial friction between Ireland and England\r\narises from the vulgar belief that, because the two peoples employ\r\nroughly the same language, they must be one people; the other half\r\nfrom the abysmal ignorance of Ireland exhibited by the English\r\nand the no less abysmal ignorance of England exhibited by the\r\nIrish. Apart from those who for reasons of sport or business are\r\ntaken regularly from the one country to the other, there is little\r\nintercourse between them: a hundred Englishmen go to France or\r\nItaly for one who goes to Ireland; and, without a steadying glimpse\r\nof reality to check a too exuberant imagination on either side,\r\nthe Irishman deduces an England made up of commercial travellers\r\nfrom Liverpool and of six-day trippers to Killarney or Portrush,\r\nwhile the Englishman constructs a figure from the novels of Lever\r\nand half persuades himself that Irishmen habitually brandish\r\nshillelaghs and welcome bad government for its own sake and for\r\nlove of a grievance. The literary conception[5] has been somewhat\r\nrefined by the writings of Shaw and Synge, of Somerville and Ross,\r\nbut he would be little out of pocket who offered a reward to any\r\nEnglishman who could distinguish between the intonation of a Galway\r\nfisherman and the accent of Sir Edward Carson.\r\n\r\nSome progress towards understanding will be achieved when it is\r\nrealised that the Irish derive from an older and different wave\r\nof westerly migration and were a civilised and proselytising\r\nnation when the English were a pagan collection of barbarian\r\ntributaries distracted by the withdrawal of the Roman legions\r\nfrom Britain. Insulated from Europe by a second sea, Ireland\r\nhas retained a faith, a poetry and a mysticism which in England\r\ncould not withstand the materialising influence of commercial\r\ndevelopment nor the imperial fruits of participation in European\r\npolitics; the Irish have never regarded industrial pre-eminence as\r\nthe goal of human energy and ambition, they never will; and they\r\nare deaf to the lure of imperialism. Those who confound mysticism\r\nwith sentiment mistake the most mystical people in Europe for the\r\nmost sentimental; the Irish are without sentimentality, and their\r\ncynicism, once realised, tempts the bewildered alien to doubt their\r\nspiritual quality until he discovers that cynicism may be used as\r\nprotective colouring. In conflict with neighbours of sometimes\r\nless generous soul the Irish forgive easily, perhaps they forgive\r\ntoo easily; they never forget, and perhaps it would be for their\r\ngood if they learned to forget. They are more chivalrous than most\r\nof the nations in Europe and more chaste than any. In common with\r\nthe rest of the world they believe that a man is worthless unless\r\nhe will die for his ideals; they believe also that an ideal is\r\nworthless if men will not die for it. To the English, who in normal\r\ntimes will do anything for an ideal but sacrifice themselves for\r\nit and who will risk their necks for anything but an ideal, this\r\nfanaticism is as inexplicable as it is exasperating.\r\n\r\nIn all political relations an Irishman interprets patriotism to\r\nmean his love for Ireland; in all relations with the British\r\nGovernment Ireland is offered, a year too late, what she would have\r\naccepted thankfully a year earlier. When English political parties\r\nare vying with one another to press upon Ireland a remedy for which\r\nthe time has passed, it is hard to recall the days when coercion\r\nbill trod on the heels of coercion bill and \"twenty years of\r\nresolute government\" was proposed as the blunt, common-sense method\r\nof curing a nation that aspired to independence: Ireland turbulent,\r\nit was said, was unfit for self-government, Ireland at peace no\r\nlonger wanted it. In two hundred and fifty years England had tried\r\nevery expedient, from the Cromwellian massacres to the Wyndham land\r\nact, with the exception of just that political autonomy which she\r\nblessed so fervently when it was won by Greece and Italy, Bulgaria,\r\nServia and Roumania. Still the Irish dreamed of a national destiny,\r\nstill the imperial genius of the English bled Ireland slowly to\r\ndeath. More than a century after the act of union, a conservative\r\nministry discovered that perhaps the Irish really desired to\r\ncontrol their own fate; and the twenty years of resolute government\r\nended in an abortive scheme of devolution. It is true that Mr.\r\nWyndham, a great scholar, a greater gentleman and one of the\r\ngreatest friends that Ireland ever had, was denounced, betrayed and\r\nleft to die heartbroken; his work lived after him; and, when the\r\nLiberal party returned to power in 1906, it was agreed, though not\r\nadmitted, by all that some concession must be made to the Irish\r\ndemand for home rule; all in turn now prescribe milk, when brandy\r\nis required, and brandy, when oxygen alone will save the patient's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nDay after day and year after year, the political youth of any one\r\nwho was born after the first home rule bill has been overcast by\r\nIreland; for a moment the dream of O'Connell and Parnell seemed\r\nlikely to be realised by Redmond; but the shadow descended again in\r\nthe hour of his death to darken the youth of another generation,\r\nas it descended in the hour of Mr. Gladstone's last defeat and\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIf the party of reform in the last years of the nineteenth century\r\nseemed to be waiting for the death of its leader, the whole\r\nEnglish world seems, in retrospect, to have been waiting for the\r\ndeath of the older generation and for the passing of an era which\r\nwas arrested in its decay by the venerable presence and vigour\r\nof the queen and Mr. Gladstone, of Cardinal Manning and Cardinal\r\nNewman, of Dr. Spurgeon and Miss Nightingale. The great Victorian\r\nage, solid and stable, rich in discovery and invention, richer\r\nin literature and art, spanned the historical chasm between the\r\neighteenth century and the twentieth: the political unrest and\r\ntransition which perplexed the sons of George III had given\r\nplace to an order so settled that, in the last years of George\r\nIII's granddaughter, it seemed to defy change; the licence which\r\nendured as a legacy of the Napoleonic wars and as a memory of\r\nthe Regency had been ended by the example and influence of the\r\nqueen; in material strength and in the bewildering splendour of\r\nimperial pageantry, England stood higher than at any time since\r\nthe last years of Queen Elizabeth. There is a tendency among\r\nthe shallow-minded of the present day to see only the stiff\r\nconventionality and smug complacency of Victorianism, to ridicule\r\nits solemnity and to castigate its occasional tastelessness: in\r\nthe eyes of such critics, Victorianism is to be remembered only by\r\nthe Albert Memorial. Already in the Queen's last years there might\r\nbe heard murmurs of revolt against the bloodless rectitude of life\r\nwhich she inspired; hopes were entertained that, when at length the\r\nPrince of Wales came to the throne, cheerfulness might be allowed\r\nto break in; the English had been on their best behaviour for too\r\nlong and were profoundly bored.\r\n\r\nWhen those who opened their eyes on the second half of the eighties\r\nwere still young children, the first attack was made on the\r\noutposts of Victorian \"respectability\": the \"new woman\" made her\r\nappearance, defiantly smoking in public and--until threatened with\r\nviolence by an outraged and susceptible mob--bicycling about the\r\nstreets of London in \"bloomers\"; new ideas were spread, new rights\r\nsuggested and an alarming new freedom of discussion inaugurated\r\nby the plays of Ibsen; a new wave of riches poured into England\r\nfrom the Rand, their possessors resolute to enjoy them without\r\nthe restrictions of an outworn decorum. The epithet which has\r\nbecome the historic description of these years is \"roaring,\" and,\r\nif it described something which by modern standards was mild and\r\nblameless, the vigour of the word registers the public misgiving\r\nand astonishment at the thing which it described. Nevertheless,\r\nthough this brawling exuberance gave an earnest of what would\r\ncome when the brawlers had discredited Victorianism, as yet\r\nthey misconducted themselves clandestinely or \"under the eye of\r\nperpetual disapprobation\": the nod and frown of the court were\r\nstill potent; and the rulers of half-a-dozen great houses decided\r\neffectively and subject only to the veto of the queen who should be\r\nreceived in the small and envied world known as \"society.\"\r\n\r\nIn the realm of literature, where the writ of social rulers did\r\nnot run, a steady movement towards intellectual freedom, more\r\npermanent in its results and less open to criticism in its course,\r\nmade itself felt; and few more illuminating contrasts between the\r\nmental range of late Victorianism and that of the present day\r\ncan be presented than by a study of the once forbidden problems\r\nwhich may now be discussed in novels, on the stage and in the\r\npress. The free lover and the unmarried mother have escaped from\r\nthe tribunal of the moralist into the consulting-room of the\r\npathologist and the workshop of the artist; diseases never before\r\nmentioned have supplied the dramatist with a motive; vices still\r\nunmentionable furnish a hinted explanation to the psychologist. And\r\nbetween men and women of almost any age there is an unembarrassed\r\ninterchange of opinion, not always free from the gratification of\r\nmorbid curiosity, which exceeds the limits even of what may be\r\ndebated in print. The belief in safety through innocence has been\r\nreplaced by a belief in safety through knowledge; the war went far\r\ntowards completing the work begun by the early prophets of women's\r\nrights; while the change in outlook must be recorded, there has\r\nnot yet been time to judge it in its effects on the well-being\r\nof the nation or on the spiritual quality of the individual. The\r\nrevolutionaries of this, as of all other epochs, are too much\r\nconcerned in pursuing liberty as an end to regard it as a means.\r\n\r\nTo them the restrictions of Victorianism would be as intolerable as\r\nits pleasures would be insipid. London, in the nineties, formal and\r\nunvarying, was only in session from Easter until Goodwood; and the\r\nslave of routine followed his appointed path from Sussex to Cowes,\r\nfrom Cowes to a foreign watering-place or to Scotland and from\r\nScotland, by way of long visits in different parts of the country,\r\nto the shires, returning to London in the spring after a taste of\r\ncosmopolitanism in the south of France. Once more in England, he\r\nattended a succession of parties as punctually and conscientiously\r\nas he murmured the responses in church; if they grew irksome,\r\nthere was no alternative, and, if he absented himself, he incurred\r\nthe suspicion, in that intimate small world, of having been left\r\nuninvited. So for seven days a week and for twelve weeks of seven\r\ndays: the week-end party, which now diverts a few and exhausts the\r\nrest, only dates from the early nineties; Sunday was always passed\r\nin London, with church and church parade, a luncheon party and\r\nceremonial calls to urge the lagging hours.\r\n\r\nThough the young girl unchaperoned was the young girl abandoned,\r\nit is probably the young bachelor who would have most reason to\r\ndread the obligations entailed by a plunge back into the nineties.\r\nEtiquette ordained that he must leave cards at any house where\r\nhe had dined or danced; and a call in those strict days, when no\r\none but a sloven would dare to be seen without a tall hat between\r\nthe months of May and July, postulated that the caller must array\r\nhimself in frock-coat and all its concomitants and, for a reason\r\nstill obscure, must carry his hat into the drawing-room. Later,\r\nas a concession to human weakness and in imitation of the bar, a\r\nmorning-coat was permitted; serge suits and bowler hats, exhibiting\r\nthemselves tentatively at either end of the week, were excused by\r\na presumed sojourn in the country; and then, with the speed of an\r\navalanche, the reign of dandified dowdiness set in, tidying itself\r\nslowly into comfort that was also presentable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPolitically, too, it was felt that the passing of the Victorian era\r\nwould be accompanied by upheaval and a transference of power.\r\n\r\nThe middle-class electorate which ultimately ruled England from\r\n1832 to 1867 was extended by the reform bills of the latter\r\nyear and of 1884 to include the vast majority of the adult male\r\nworking-classes. At the time of this generous dilution Robert\r\nLowe caustically suggested that it would be well to \"educate\r\nour masters,\" and in the middle of his 1868 administration Mr.\r\nGladstone introduced universal elementary education into England.\r\nThe first children to benefit by this belated afterthought were\r\nmen and women who were in the early twenties by the time that the\r\ngeneration which is now being described was able to read and to see\r\nwhat others were reading; its members grew up side by side with\r\nthe numerous progeny of a popular, cheap press, and its future\r\nrulers were in a state to digest and discuss political problems for\r\nthemselves and by themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that a knowledge of letters gave to democracy\r\npolitical wisdom; it is probable that, while new classes were\r\nenabled to spread and to receive political doctrines, later to\r\nunite and organise themselves into political bodies, their instinct\r\nfor affairs became blunted and debased. \"Some of us,\" wrote Lord\r\nBryce in _Modern Democracies_, \"remember among the English rustics\r\nof sixty years ago shrewd men unable to read, but with plenty of\r\nmother wit, and by their strong sense and solid judgement quite as\r\nwell qualified to vote as are their grandchildren to-day who read\r\na newspaper and revel in the cinema. The first people who ever\r\nworked popular government, working it by machinery more complicated\r\nthan ours, had no printed page to learn from.... These Greek\r\nvoters learnt their politics not from the printed, and few even\r\nfrom any written page, but by listening to accomplished orators\r\nand by talking to one another.... It is thinking that matters,\r\nnot reading.... In conversation there is a clash of wits, and to\r\nthat some mental exertion must go.... The man who reads only the\r\nnewspaper of his own party, and reads its political intelligence in\r\na medley of other stuff, narratives of crimes and descriptions of\r\nfootball matches, need not know that there is more than one side\r\nto a question.... The printed page, because it seems to represent\r\nsome unknown power, is believed more readily than what he hears in\r\ntalk.... A party organ, suppressing some facts, misrepresenting\r\nothers, is the worst of all guides.... That impulse to hasty and\r\nill-considered action which was the besetting danger of ruling\r\nassemblies swayed by orators, will reappear in the impression\r\nsimultaneously produced through the press on masses of men all over\r\na large country.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the last thirty years may come to be regarded,\r\nin the development of democracy, as the history of the press rising\r\nvictorious over the political mass-meeting, even as the political\r\nmass-meeting, since the days of Mr. Gladstone's electoral campaign\r\nof 1880, had been gradually rising victorious over the House of\r\nCommons. It is possible again that the present moment registers\r\nthe highest point which newspaper influence will reach and that,\r\nduring the next thirty years, the publicity of the cinematograph\r\nand of the poster will rise victorious over the press. The\r\npatriotism of the public during the war was kept alive by direct\r\nand simple appeals to enlistment and economy; they issued their\r\nmessage from every hoarding and competed for public interest with\r\nadvertisements for patent foods and soaps. Though its want of\r\ndignity may have offended the fastidious, this method of propaganda\r\npermitted neither argument nor contradiction; the government stated\r\nits case and plastered the countryside with an exhortation or\r\ndeclaration for which the public paid and which the press could not\r\novertake. Since the war, the government has employed this method of\r\npropaganda in more than one industrial dispute: wages and profits,\r\nnationalisation and private ownership are debated on convenient\r\nwalls; it is recognised that, in a democracy, knowledge must not be\r\ndenied to the people; and, as in the first French revolution, it is\r\nbelieved that the information can be supplied most attractively by\r\nthe government itself. Robert Lowe, were he still alive, might feel\r\nmalicious satisfaction in seeing the use to which democracy had put\r\nits long-deferred education and the manner in which the ultimate\r\nmasters of democracy are educated.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of diffused, cheap printing and of the power\r\nof reading and expression was that democracy became articulate and\r\norganised, ready to play in the business of government that part\r\nto which it was entitled by its votes, but to which others were\r\nby no means ready to admit it. In the conversation and literature\r\nof these years may be traced a profound uneasiness at the onward\r\nmarch of labour, and the opponents of democracy vented their fear\r\nand hostility in outbursts of almost hysterical bitterness against\r\nthe ignorant, gullible, self-seeking and rapacious proletariat into\r\nwhose hands the welfare of the empire had been surrendered.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Carlyle's Teufelsdröckh had written: \"Two men I honour,\r\nand no third. First, the toil-worn Craftsman that with earth-made\r\nImplement laboriously conquers the Earth, and makes her man's.\r\nVenerable to me is the hard Hand; crooked, coarse; wherein\r\nnotwithstanding lies a cunning virtue, indefeasibly royal, as of\r\nthe Sceptre of this Planet. Venerable, too, is the rugged face,\r\nall weather-tanned, besoiled, with its rude intelligence; for it\r\nis the face of a Man living manlike. O, but the more venerable\r\nfor thy rudeness, and even because we must pity as well as love\r\nthee! Hardly-entreated brother! For us was thy back so bent, for\r\nus were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed: thou wert our\r\nConscript, on whom the lot fell, and fighting our battles wert so\r\nmarred.\" In 1850 the fear of Chartism had purged Carlyle's mind\r\nof this veneration, pity and love for a man living manlike, a\r\nhardly-entreated brother and a conscript who had been marred in\r\nfighting the battles of others. \"Consider, in fact,\" he exhorts\r\nhis readers, \"a body of Six-hundred and fifty-eight miscellaneous\r\npersons set to consult about 'business' with Twenty-seven millions\r\nmostly fools assiduously listening to them, and checking and\r\ncriticising them--was there ever since the world began, will there\r\never be till the world end, any 'business' accomplished in these\r\ncircumstances?\"\r\n\r\nFor fifty years, from Carlyle to Kipling, this scorn for a\r\ndeliberative assembly and this contempt for an electorate which had\r\nhitherto been sedulously denied all political education frustrated\r\nall attempts to modify the old machine of government and to\r\nassimilate the new rulers to the old. \"Bigots,\" said Macaulay, \"...\r\nnever fail to plead in justification of persecution the vices which\r\npersecution has engendered. England has been to the Jews less than\r\nhalf a country; and we revile them because they do not feel for\r\nEngland more than a half patriotism. We treat them as slaves, and\r\nwonder that they do not regard us as brethren....\"\r\n\r\nWith little change of language, the disabilities of the Jews\r\ncould be paralleled by the disabilities of labour; and both were\r\ndefended by the same spirit of blatant intolerance which rose in a\r\nself-satisfied _crescendo_ during the second half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, till a cynic might have said that, as there had been no\r\nclass-antagonism, it would become necessary to create one. Of\r\nthe present conflict between classes and of any conflict in the\r\nimmediate future the seeds were sown in the last years of Queen\r\nVictoria's reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe men of this epoch grew up half-way between the second harvest\r\nof great nineteenth-century literature and the first crop of\r\nthe twentieth. In their early boyhood, Tennyson was still Poet\r\nLaureate, Browning was still prolific and Swinburne's last song\r\nwas not yet sung; George Meredith and Thomas Hardy were still in\r\npractise as novelists, and Robert Louis Stevenson was approaching\r\nthe climax of his powers; John Ruskin, though silent, was still\r\nalive; the influence of Walter Pater was at its zenith; the\r\nreputation of Herbert Spencer stood higher than at any time before\r\nor since; and John Morley was in his prime. Among the younger men\r\nwho were winning fame--with the surge and thunder that heralded\r\nthe youth of the nineties--was Rudyard Kipling; the seething\r\nbrain of H. G. Wells was boiling over into scientific romance;\r\nand old romance was brought to life by the charm of Anthony Hope.\r\nAmong those who were doing the work for which a belated fame was\r\nreserved were Samuel Butler and Joseph Conrad. For experimenting,\r\nadventurous youth the pages of _The Yellow Book_ lay open; \"the men\r\nof the nineties\" flashed meteorically across the deafened heavens,\r\nand, when they had passed with their falsity and clamour, there\r\nwas discovered in their train the more abiding genius of Whistler\r\nand Beardsley, the precocious, detached perfection of Beerbohm,\r\nthe occasional beauty of Gray and Dowson, the alternate paste and\r\ndiamond of Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nThese were the last working years of Leighton and Watts, of Holman\r\nHunt and Morris, of Tenniel and Crane; the heyday of Ricketts and\r\nShannon; the morning of Phil May. They were the years, too, of the\r\nfirst illustrated magazines and of those _Strands_, ever memorable\r\nto the boys of that generation, in which _Sherlock Holmes_ appeared\r\nmonth after month.\r\n\r\nA new chapter in dramatic history was opened by Pinero with _The\r\nSecond Mrs. Tanqueray_; and, though Shaw and Barrie were not yet\r\ncome into their own, though Galsworthy and Barker were not yet\r\narticulate, the last decade of the nineteenth century was the\r\nsummer time of the British stage for a hundred years. Irving ruled\r\nstill imperially, with Terriss, Forbes Robertson and Wyndham among\r\nhis marshals; Boucicault, Toole and Bancroft were still alive; it\r\nwas not yet impossible to find a theatre for serious drama, and\r\nthe seductions of burlesque and of musical comedy were confined to\r\nDaly's and the old Gaiety.\r\n\r\nThe music-halls of that period did not come within the purview of\r\na boy: the humour was too broad, the air too much tainted, the\r\nassociations too squalid; but in those days the true \"variety\r\nentertainment\"--exhibiting hardly less continuity than the modern\r\n_revue_--was still to be seen, the old-fashioned chairman still sat\r\nat his table surrounded by privileged friends, the prices were\r\nhalf those of the theatre, it was exceptional for a man to appear\r\nin evening dress and inconceivable for a woman of repute to appear\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe memory of a child is pierced, deeply and without order, by\r\nquarter-comprehended sights and sounds. Those were the days of\r\nLottie Collins and _Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay_, of _The Man Who Broke\r\nthe Bank at Monte Carlo_ and of _The Bicycle Made for Two_--this\r\nlast to commemorate the safety bicycle which took England by storm\r\nand urged the citizens of London in endless, untiring circles\r\nround Regent's Park on Sunday mornings. These were the days of\r\nMay Yohe and _Honey, ma Honey_, of Hayden Coffin and _Sunshine\r\nAbove_, of Albert Chevalier and his coster songs; of Dan Leno and\r\nHerbert Campbell in immortal partnership at Drury Lane pantomimes,\r\nof Corney Grain--and a piano; of Sims Reeves at the Queen's Hall,\r\nold and inexpressibly sweet; of Maskelyne and Cook at the Egyptian\r\nHall, of Moore and Burgess at the St. James' Hall; they were the\r\ndays of \"Niagara\" and the old Aquarium.\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle nineties, when the \"knife-board\" omnibus\r\nwas still to be seen in the streets, that London was excited by\r\nan exhibition of \"horseless carriages,\" though for a few years\r\nstill a small boy might be driven to Berkeley Square on a summer\r\nafternoon, there to draw up under the trees opposite Gunter's and\r\nconsume raspberry ices. In those days the cows and milk-stall\r\nwere not yet evicted from St. James' Park; Booksellers Row had\r\nnot been sacrificed to the improvement of London, which was then\r\nmore picturesque and less sanitary. Those were the days of the\r\nlong frost; the days of the Klondike gold-rush, the Jameson raid,\r\nthe Græco-Turkish war; days in which a boy heard dying rumours\r\nof a \"baccarat case,\" of the Parnell divorce, of Barnie Barnato's\r\ndeath, rumours more active but less intelligible of vast financial\r\noperations and vaster crashes.\r\n\r\nThe first five years of life, perhaps the first seven, are the\r\nhinterland of memory in which a trail is blazed by word or name\r\nand, later, a road straightened and made durable by reading. After\r\nseven, memory is in ordered cultivation: after 1895 public events\r\nmarshal themselves and stand out against the uneventful background\r\nof the child's daily life. The fall of the Rosebery government\r\nseemed less important than Mr. Gladstone's retirement the year\r\nbefore and, to a boy, neither equalled in excitement the Diamond\r\nJubilee with its thanksgiving-service and procession, its songs and\r\nmarches, its bunting and illumination. A year later the news-bills\r\nstopped every passer-by with the words: \"DEATH OF GLADSTONE\"; and\r\nchildren who had never seen him cried in the streets of London as\r\nthey had cried in America or Italy at the passing of Lincoln or\r\nGaribaldi.\r\n\r\nA year later still came rumours of discord in South Africa; and\r\nthe patriot of the private school waited eagerly for a declaration\r\nof war, less eagerly for news that President Kruger had yielded\r\nto pressure; the memory of the Spithead review which had followed\r\nthe massing of an empire's troops at the Diamond Jubilee was still\r\nvivid, and in a hundred thousand truculent hearts there lurked the\r\nsinister thought that an army and navy were useless if they did not\r\nfight and that small nations existed, in the scheme of creation,\r\nto be taught sharp lessons. The handful of opponents who cried out\r\non an impious war of aggression were shouted down or manhandled as\r\n\"pro-Boers\" until the cheers of the Irish and of a few radicals,\r\nwhen a British reverse was announced in the House of Commons,\r\nconvinced the wondering militarists that opposition might be\r\nprompted by a moral sense as well as by native factiousness. These\r\nwere the days of _The Absent-Minded Beggar_, of \"Black Friday\"\r\nand the Fall of Ladysmith, of the aged queen's recruiting-tour in\r\nIreland, of the relief of Mafeking and \"Mafeking Night\" in London;\r\nthe days when Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener were sent out to cut\r\nshort the retribution which the arrogance of a swollen power had\r\ncalled down upon its head, the days of concentration-camps and \"the\r\nmethods of barbarism,\" of the \"Khaki\" election, of _The Islanders_\r\nand the last despairing shriek of that vulgar ferocity which had\r\nbrought about this needless and iniquitous bloodshed; the days of\r\nQueen Victoria's last illness and death, the approach of peace.\r\n\r\nThe chapter of imperialism which opened with Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nultimatum and ended with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's grant of\r\nself-government to the Union of South Africa was only symptomatic\r\nof a wider-spread arrogance and savagery. While the war was still\r\nin progress, another chapter of history, shorter but not less\r\ninfamous, was being enacted in the suppression of the Boxer rising\r\nand--incidentally--in the looting of the palace at Pekin. It was in\r\nthe middle of these two excursions that there began the six years'\r\nsojourn at Westminster, to which reference was made in the last\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCHRIST CHURCH\r\n\r\n \"Come, doctor,\" said Euphranor, suddenly, \"you, who find such\r\n fault with others' education, shall tell me how _you_ would bring\r\n up a young knight, till you turned him out of your hands a Man.\"\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n \"I doubt I shall be content with him,\" said I, \"if (at sixteen\r\n say) he shows me outwardly ... a glowing cheek, an open brow,\r\n copious locks, a clear eye, and looks me full in the face withal;\r\n ... the blood running warm and quick through his veins, and easily\r\n discovering itself in his cheeks and forehead, at the mention of\r\n what is noble or shameful.... Candid of soul I hope he is; for\r\n I have always sought his confidence, and never used it against\r\n himself.... He is still passionate perhaps, as in his first\r\n septenniad, but easily reconciled; subdued easily by affection and\r\n the appeal to old and kindly remembrance, but stubborn against\r\n force; generous, forgiving: still liking to ride rather than to\r\n read, and perhaps to settle a difference by the fist than by the\r\n tongue; but submitting to those who do not task him above Nature's\r\n due....\"\r\n\r\n \"And this is your education,\" said Euphranor, \"for all boys\r\n indiscriminately, without regard to any particular genius they may\r\n show.\"\r\n\r\n \"But without injury to it, I hope,\" said I; ... \"if Sir Lancelot\r\n not only _has_ a Genius, (as I suppose all men have some,)\r\n but _is_ a Genius--big with Epic, Lyrical or Parliamentary\r\n inspiration,--I do not meddle with him--he will take his own\r\n course in spite of me. What I have to turn out is, not a Genius,\r\n but a Young Gentleman, qualified at least for the common\r\n professions, or trades, if you like it. Or if he have means and\r\n inclination to live independently on his estate, may, _in spite_\r\n of his genius, turn into a very good husband, father, neighbour,\r\n and magistrate....\"\r\n\r\n               EDWARD FITZGERALD: _Euphranor: A Dialogue on Youth_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAt noon on Friday of the second week in October, 1906, a slow\r\nprocession of cabs jingled down the slope from the Great Western\r\nstation at Oxford and turned under the bridge towards the middle\r\nof the town. At Carfax they separated east, north and south,\r\nbearing through the High, the Corn and Saint Aldates their burden\r\nof expectant, fluttered freshmen, who had been summoned, on this\r\nfirst day of the term, to present themselves early for admission\r\nto their colleges and university. At Tom Gate the newcomers to the\r\nHouse enquired for their rooms, paid their cabmen and left their\r\nluggage to follow them. Over the doors in Peckwater or Canterbury,\r\nMeadow Buildings, Old Library or Tom they found their names\r\npainted in black on a white ground; they introduced themselves to\r\ntheir scouts--who alone in all Oxford affected interest in their\r\nexistence,--ordered luncheon and sat down to recall the more\r\npressing advice on deportment which had been bestowed on them.\r\n\r\nTo a freshman, the etiquette and technique of Oxford abound in real\r\nand, still more, in imaginary pitfalls. He may live for years on\r\nthe same staircase as a man one term his senior, but, unless they\r\nhave been introduced, he must never bow nor say \"good-morning\"\r\nto him. The senior would, perhaps, leave a card on the freshman,\r\nchoosing a moment when he was not at home; the freshman must return\r\nhis call, but it was not enough to leave a card: he must go on\r\ncalling until he ran him to earth. In all things a freshman must\r\ncomport himself humbly, taking a distant seat in the junior common\r\nroom and leaving the arm-chairs in front of the fire to those\r\nwho better deserved them. There were rules of dress and rules of\r\nconduct; there were clubs which a man would feel honoured to join\r\nand clubs which he would prudently avoid; there were games worth\r\nplaying and games that were waste of time.\r\n\r\nWhen the appointed day came, the ordeal was refreshingly light\r\nand quickly forgotten in the joyous sense of possession which a\r\nman's own rooms, with his shining, black name painted over the\r\ndoor, gives him more fully, perhaps, than he ever knows later; the\r\nsense of protection, too, at a time when he feels more solitary and\r\nunwanted than ever before. Though the carpet were threadbare and\r\nthe curtains dingy, though sofa and chairs needed recovering and\r\nthe meagre blankets on one bed bore the name of \"Arthur Bourchier\"\r\nand a date four years before the new owner was born, the rooms\r\nbelonged to him _de facto_, and within a few hours he would _de\r\njure_ belong to them; it was time to unpack books and pictures\r\nand to study the regulations and hints embodied in the brochure\r\nlibellously known as \"The Blue Liar.\"\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon the freshmen were collected in Hall for presentation\r\nto the Dean.[6] The Old Westminsters gathered together to discuss\r\ntheir rooms and to exchange whispered confidences. From Hall\r\nthey were ushered to the Old Schools and admitted members of the\r\nuniversity by the vice-chancellor. Then they drew breath.\r\n\r\nThe bond of an identic school held them in small groups which\r\nexplored one another's rooms and perambulated Oxford to purchase\r\nbedroom ware and such other necessaries of life as had not been\r\nincluded in the equipment taken over, at a valuation, from the\r\nprevious tenants. They made a preliminary inspection of picture\r\nshops and turned over the books in Blackwell's; they bought\r\ntobacco--and refused to buy pipe-racks and tobacco-jars enriched\r\nwith the college arms, because these were \"freshers' delights\" and\r\na mark of juvenility to be avoided. Then they returned to college\r\nand discovered that already a few of their senior friends had left\r\ncards. And then it was time to discover which were the freshmen's\r\ntables in hall.\r\n\r\nIf for an hour or two it had seemed that no one but their scouts\r\nwas interested in their existence, they were to find within their\r\nfirst week a flattering competition for their company. First of\r\nall, their tutors invited them to call and arrange what lectures\r\nthey were to attend; after that, the president and secretary of\r\ninnumerable clubs solicited their patronage. Then came the turn of\r\nthe literary and debating societies, in which the House abounded.\r\nIt was a matter of no little importance to have a club-meeting for\r\nat least six nights in the week: only the more serious members\r\nstayed for anything but the highly personal questions and motions\r\nof \"private business,\" but during that first stimulating half-hour\r\nthe visitors and their hosts could feast richly and variously on\r\nthe abundant dessert supplied by the club; at nine o'clock they\r\ncould leave, pleasantly sated, to work, talk or pay calls, while\r\nthe club stalwarts remained to read plays or, unwillingly and at\r\nshort notice, to deliver conscientious speeches on the political\r\nproblems of the day.[7]\r\n\r\nOutside the college there was an almost unlimited choice of\r\nuniversity clubs: the Bullingdon, Vincent's and the Grid were\r\npurely sporting or social, the O.U.D.S. was primarily theatrical,\r\nwhile the Union--though it was not popular at the House at this\r\ntime--provided the biggest audiences and the most serious\r\ndebating. In addition, the Canning and Chatham, the Palmerston and\r\nRussell, the Strafford and Gladstone, the St. Patrick's and a dozen\r\nmore offered a varied bill of fare to every political appetite and\r\nentailed on their members the obligation of reading a solemn paper\r\nonce in every few terms and of listening to the solemn papers of\r\nother members once a week. At their annual \"wines\" and dinners\r\nthe young politician met such of the leading liberals as could be\r\nenticed to Oxford; after the arid detachment of politics at school,\r\none meeting with a single minister seemed to bring the pulsing\r\nheart of government nearer; there followed cards for receptions in\r\nLondon and invitations to join the Eighty Club.\r\n\r\nPerhaps by reason of its size, the House escaped or defied any\r\neffort to impose a uniform spirit or code. Its members were indeed\r\nunited in such practises as dressing for the theatre and in such\r\nconventions as a general disinclination for the society of other\r\ncolleges; but this was largely because they were numerous enough\r\nto provide every one with the friends, the clubs and the interests\r\nthat he required without seeking them abroad. Rival foundations\r\ncharged them with superiority and sectionalism; but, if they had\r\never made a claim for themselves, it would only have been that\r\nthey allowed their neighbours to live unmolested. There was no\r\nSunday-evening \"After,\" at which the whole college met; no concert;\r\nno \"Freshmen's Wine.\" All were left free to choose their friends\r\nand to pass their time as they liked, provided that they did not\r\noffend against public taste or make a nuisance of themselves to\r\ntheir neighbours.\r\n\r\nNew friendships came rapidly in those first few weeks. At the\r\nfreshmen's tables in hall, the freshmen's pews in the cathedral, on\r\nthe football-ground, in the common room and clubs and at a score of\r\nbreakfast-parties given for their benefit, the men in their first\r\nyear came to know one another. There followed testing, sifting and\r\nan occasional change of value; the bond of the identic school was\r\ngradually relaxed; and small groups broke away from the general\r\ntables in hall and established messes of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOxford is a loose confederation of jealously independent states;\r\nand a man must have considerable personality or prowess to be known\r\noutside his own college. There are always one or two men[8] with a\r\nreputation extending beyond their own walls and promising a later\r\ndistinction; but there are seldom more than a handful of exceptions\r\nin any undergraduate generation. Of the House this is especially\r\ntrue, as it is almost a university in itself, and no one need go\r\noutside it. The patriotism and hero-worship of a public school had\r\nmade it inconceivable that a new boy should pass one week without\r\nknowing who was the Captain of Cricket; at Oxford in every year\r\nthere must have been hundreds unaware who was President of the Boat\r\nClub. The greatest emancipation that came to all on leaving school\r\nwas just this freedom to be interested in what they liked. The\r\ntyranny of games was broken; the snobbism of pretended enthusiasms\r\nsank into abeyance; and many who had been despised and rejected at\r\nschool began suddenly to shine as unexpected social lights.\r\n\r\nThe choice of friends marched step by step with the tentative first\r\nefforts in hospitality. Entertaining is made easy in a college\r\nwhere a man orders breakfast or luncheon for as many guests as\r\nhis rooms will contain, where the epicure descends to the college\r\nkitchen and chooses an apolaustic repast, where wine and cup\r\nare as easily had from the buttery and where the junior common\r\nroom supplies the coffee and dessert. His scout and scout's boy,\r\nprepare the table and attend to the waiting (how they do it when\r\nseveral parties take place simultaneously on the same staircase\r\nis a craft-secret which is handed down from one generation to\r\nanother); when his own cutlery, glass and china run short, his\r\nscout borrows from the abundance of a neighbour. And, when the\r\nfeast is done, the host is not disturbed by the frugal housewife's\r\nconcern for the broken meats, for they have been decently packed\r\nand discreetly removed by his scout. The imagination of the curious\r\nmay sometimes exercise itself to picture the internal chaos of a\r\nscout's digestion: for six days he subsists chiefly on superfluous\r\nbutter and remainder loaves; the seventh day is one on which every\r\nundergraduate seeks to give a luncheon-party or to attend the\r\nboard of a friend. On that day the scout must fare bewilderingly\r\non undetected treasures of dressed crab, unwanted drum-sticks of\r\nchicken, trembling ruins of fruit-jelly and the unmortised halves\r\nof meringues; yet longevity is the reward of their imprudence.\r\n\r\nThere is, furthermore, a guest-table in Hall;[9] there are\r\ndining-clubs; and, when a man is grown weary of monotony, the Grid,\r\nthe O.U.D.S. and Vincent's supply relief to their members. For the\r\nfirst weeks, indeed, the hospitality comes all from the seniors;\r\nthen it is time for a freshman to repay it and to strike out for\r\nhimself in entertaining the new friends of his own year. It is a\r\ndelicate and embarrassing enterprise, for all the mechanical aid of\r\nkitchen and scout: the inexpert host fears that he has not ordered\r\nenough, he never knows how long to wait for a fourth-year man who\r\nlives out of college and has perhaps forgotten the invitation, he\r\nfails to realise--until he has himself ceased to be a freshman--the\r\ndevastating horror of a three-or four-course breakfast at half-past\r\neight with obligatory conversation. And, not content with one\r\nventure, he repeats it in cold blood.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation in being allowed to choose friends and amusements\r\nis hardly greater than the latitude in arranging the work of three\r\nor four years. A mathematical scholar is, indeed, not expected to\r\nread the Modern Language School; but for the commoner there is\r\nalmost unlimited range of optional subjects to take and varied\r\nlectures to attend. Here is a further step in emancipation and\r\nresponsibility: when a man has satisfied the bare minimum demanded\r\nby authority, he must work out his own salvation; there is a point\r\nat which, if he will not read for himself, it is not worth any\r\none's while to compel him. Many of those who kept a political goal\r\nahead of them elected to study Modern History, for which it may\r\nbe asserted that in scope and variety, in the volume of reading,\r\nthe mental discipline and the practical benefit of knowledge and\r\nperspective it excels even the final school of _Literæ Humaniores_\r\nwhich has been for so long the peculiar glory of Oxford. Touching\r\nthe ancient world at one end and modern politics at the other,\r\ninterlaced with geography, economics, political science, law and\r\nmodern languages, it does indeed exclude natural science and\r\nAsiatic languages, but it excludes little else.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSome of the most common English phrases are also those which most\r\nobstinately defy exact definition. It is related of an obscure\r\nenquirer that he gave his life to elucidating the significance of\r\n\"a man-about-town,\" having met the phrase but not the type to which\r\nit is applied. For years he wandered moodily about London in search\r\nof a specimen, growing ever more abstracted and becoming in time a\r\nfamiliar figure in the streets, until his researches were cut short\r\non the day when he was knocked down by a motor-bus and fatally\r\ninjured. Though carried promptly to the nearest hospital, he\r\nsurvived only a few hours; as the end approached, one of the nurses\r\nsought to strengthen his resistance by shewing him an account of\r\nthe mishap in an early edition of an evening paper; the last words\r\nthat he ever read were: \"ACCIDENT TO WELL-KNOWN MAN-ABOUT-TOWN.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fate as disappointing, if not so tragic, awaits him who seeks to\r\nfind a definition of \"the Oxford manner.\" It is seemingly a blazon\r\nborne by every man who has been at Oxford and quickly recognised by\r\nevery one who has not. When Herrick in _The Ebb Tide_ anchored in\r\nthe lagoon of an uncharted Pacific pearl-fishery, something in his\r\nspeech or bearing caused Attwater to ask: '\"University man?\" ...\r\n\"Yes, Merton,\" said Herrick, and the next moment blushed scarlet at\r\nhis indiscretion. \"I am of the other lot,\" said Attwater: \"Trinity\r\nHall, Cambridge. I call my schooner after the old shop....\"'\r\nWithout delay Attwater then made himself insolently rude to the two\r\nmen who had been neither at Oxford nor at Cambridge. The fact that\r\nStevenson was himself an Edinburgh man may explain his creature's\r\nability to detect the Oxford manner; for Oxford men the task is\r\nless easy and is but made the harder by the involved analysis which\r\nexplains it as \"the expression of a superiority which every Oxford\r\nman is too superior to shew.\"\r\n\r\nSo little sense of superiority clouds the brain of most Oxford\r\nmen that they are humbly grateful, their whole life through,\r\nfor their good fortune in spending three happy years, howsoever\r\nlittle distinguished, in the most beautiful of all kingdoms of\r\nyouth. No city in the world has been so decreed, constructed,\r\nendowed and ordered for the benefit and enjoyment of the boys\r\nwho there reach a privileged manhood. The university returns\r\nits own members to parliament and preserves order among the\r\nundergraduates by means of the proctors and their satellites; the\r\nvice-chancellor's court stands between debtor and creditor; and a\r\nmember of the _corps diplomatique_ in a foreign capital is hardly\r\nmore \"extra-territorial\" than the undergraduate at Oxford. This is\r\npartly the law and partly the custom of the constitution; but to\r\nthe visitor it is less impressive than that the entire economic\r\nand social dispensation should have for object the comfort and\r\nhappiness of three thousand men between the ages of eighteen and\r\ntwenty-two. The colleges, their gardens and pleasances; the river\r\nand its barges; the theatre and clubs; the shops and streets; all\r\nhave been designed on the presumption that Oxford contains no women\r\nand that the men are of an age that never changes.[11] In their\r\nmidst there are, indeed, \"townees,\" but even the shops at which\r\nthey buy their meat are not suffered to desecrate the beauty of the\r\nHigh; there are straggling acres of houses in North Oxford, but\r\nthey exist in the undergraduate scheme as unwelcome destinations\r\nfor a duty call on Sunday afternoons in winter; the undergraduate\r\nhorizon is bounded by Christ Church Meadows and the Broad, by\r\nMagdalen Bridge and Carfax; their world consists of those who live\r\nwithin these limits.\r\n\r\nOf the three thousand who for three or four years gloried in that\r\nkingdom, a few did no work at all and, when their days of grace\r\nexpired, went down for good or until they had passed the necessary\r\nexaminations; those who hoped for a high class in an honour school\r\nperforce worked hard during term and harder in vacation; the\r\naverage man of average intelligence, reading a pass school, could\r\nbe content with four or six hours' work a day and an untroubled\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nMore than six hours is not easy to maintain, for, though the\r\nterm is but eight weeks long, a man is living at high pressure\r\nin a low-lying city. Those who had their schools at heart would\r\nget up at half-past seven and keep a chapel at eight, read the\r\nmorning paper, breakfast with friends or by themselves and begin\r\nwork at nine or ten; on most days they would have lectures or a\r\n\"private hour\" with their tutors and for the rest of the morning\r\nthey worked in their rooms or in the library. At one o'clock the\r\nquadrangle woke to sudden life with men returning from lectures,\r\nmen on their way out to luncheon, men in stocks and breeches\r\nassembling at Canterbury Gate to drive in brakes to a meet of the\r\nHouse beagles. They exchanged the news and badinage of the day,\r\nfrom the middle of Peck to an attic window, and from one window to\r\nanother; the quadrangle emptied and sank again to silence, as they\r\nrepaired to the common-room for a light repast of bananas and milk\r\nor toast and honey. And in turn the common room, which had filled\r\nsuddenly, as suddenly emptied; within a quarter of an hour all had\r\ndispersed to the football ground or the House barge, a private\r\ngravel tennis-court or the hockey ground; one or two went sailing\r\non the Upper River, one or two more hacked slowly out of Oxford\r\nfor a gallop on Port Meadow or Shotover; and, as every generation\r\ndiscovered for itself the beauty of the surrounding country and\r\nfell anew under its spell at the whisper of the old unforgettable\r\nnames, the pedestrians struck north-west or south-west to \"the\r\nwarm, green-muffled Cumner Hills\", \"the stripling Thames at\r\nBablock-hithe\", \"Godstow Bridge, when hay-time's here in June\",\r\n\"the skirts of Bagley Wood\" or \"Hinksey and its wintry ridge\".\r\n\r\nConvention and climate ordain that no one in Oxford shall work in\r\nthe early afternoon; when the sacred exercise has been taken and\r\nall are refreshed by tea in common room or at home, there is time\r\nfor two hours' reading before Hall. After that, a man may go to\r\nthe theatre, where he will find a tolerable selection of companies\r\nand of \"London successes\";[12] he may look in at a club or retire\r\nto finish a belated essay in his rooms; he may dawdle over coffee\r\nin the common room and stroll back with a friend for one of those\r\nendless disputations which clear the head and suggest a new point\r\nof view--raw, paradoxical stuff, it may be, but earnestly argued\r\nand perhaps making up in idealism what it lacked in experience.\r\nWhatever is \"universal\" in university education comes chiefly\r\nfrom the men of one's own age and from the distillation of three\r\nthousand minds seething with youth and a new encouragement to\r\nself-expression which had been rigorously withheld at school.[13]\r\nIf the scope of reading is limited there, the limitations are\r\nbroken down to some extent by the sum of all the reading in all the\r\npublic schools. It was in the intimate late hours when some club\r\nhad dispersed that one man would talk of Browning's Jewish blood\r\nand reproduce the savage indignation of _Holy Cross Day_; another\r\nwould give forth the magic music of Synge's plays; and a generation\r\nwhich had hitherto escaped the theological preoccupation of the\r\nVictorian era argued Renan and discussed _The Golden Bough_ in\r\ncomfort of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIf in the pooling of their enthusiasms the men of this vanished\r\ngeneration advanced even one step towards the universality of\r\nspirit which is the intellectual vision of a university, they\r\nadvanced many steps nearer to a social universality than had been\r\npossible at school. Eton, by virtue of its size and repute, is\r\nfed, within the limits of one plane, by the greatest number of\r\ntributaries; but Westminster and Harrow, Winchester, Rugby and\r\nCharterhouse are filled each from its own well-defined source.\r\nAt Oxford, in greater or lesser degree, hitherto unfamiliar\r\ntypes mingled for the first time and, in social and political\r\ndebate, encountered the embodiment of what had hitherto been\r\nmalevolent abstractions: an Orange land-owner lived over the head\r\nof a rebellious home ruler; the hereditary legislator sat in\r\nHall beside the radical who expended his eloquence in trying to\r\nabolish the House of Lords. There were Catholics, Presbyterians\r\nand an occasional Jew; rich men, poor men; scholars, dunces;\r\nsceptics and fanatics; prigs and worldlings; incipient swindlers,\r\ncongenital debauchees and a vast representation of the vast average\r\nEnglish class which is between rich and poor, which is shrewd\r\nwithout being subtile, tenacious but practical, self-satisfied\r\nbut self-depreciatory, with conservative instincts and radical\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nTo all and to each, Oxford smilingly proferred her inexhaustible\r\ntray of _cotillon_ favours. There was and is and, seemingly, always\r\nmust be a class debarred by poverty from entering this kingdom;\r\nbut, once inside, there is an unmatched equality of opportunity\r\nfor rich and poor, exalted and humble, an unprecedented freedom\r\nfor each to express his individuality in the choice of his work\r\nand recreation, his friends and life. Though there, as elsewhere,\r\nthe deepest pocket commanded the greatest material comfort,\r\nnarrow means were no obstacle to the enjoyment and profit which\r\nevery man could extract from four years of the most democratic\r\nlife that England provided outside the House of Commons; nowhere\r\nwas a man taken more ungrudgingly on his merits, nowhere did the\r\neccentric--were he poser, experimenter or monomaniac--obtain a\r\nbetter run for his money.\r\n\r\nIn these days of fifteen years ago, came the first batch of Rhodes\r\nscholars. Nothing but a war will drive the average Englishman\r\nto look at a map; and nothing less than the late war would have\r\nstirred the imagination of the English to concern for the size\r\nand cohesion of the British Empire. Cecil Rhodes had been dead\r\nnearly half a generation before South Africans and Australians,\r\nNew Zealanders and Canadians--to name but a few--met together on a\r\nsingle battle-front; but his vision embraced what the war of 1914\r\nmade actual, and he, who confessedly owed more to Oxford than to\r\nany other phase of his career, made Oxford the trial-ground for\r\nthe greatest historical experiment in imperial education. With the\r\neffect of Oxford on the Rhodes scholars only a Rhodes scholar is\r\ncompetent to deal; the influence of the Rhodes scholars on Oxford\r\nwas marked. They were the picked men from the universities of the\r\nworld; not only from the dominions and colonies of the British\r\nEmpire, but from Germany as well, for Rhodes felt that conflict\r\nbetween the two countries could most surely be avoided by making\r\ntheir peoples better acquainted. Chosen for general prowess--in\r\nsport, in work, in the popularity and position which they had\r\nattained in their own universities,--they came somewhat older than\r\nthe generality in years and much older in experience; they brought\r\nnew intellectual standpoints and a deliberate wisdom to leaven the\r\nfacile cleverness and omniscience of British Oxford.[14]\r\n\r\nThose three or four years resolve themselves into a collection\r\nof exquisite memories in miniature; but, day after day and term\r\nafter term, nothing ever happened to shake a man's soul from its\r\nseating. There were glorious parties in college and on the river;\r\nthere were great rides and walks; there were splendid disputations.\r\nDuring Eights Week a man invited his sisters and friends to lunch\r\nwith him; shy and self-conscious, he met them at the station and\r\npiloted them informatively through the cathedral and hall, the\r\ncloisters and library and kitchen until it was time to stroll\r\nback to his rooms, where through the flower-boxes and open\r\nwindows could be seen cold salmon and roast chicken, meringues,\r\nstrawberries-and-cream and cider-cup spread out in monotonous\r\ninvitation, where, too, the prudent host had enlisted his most\r\nsocially gifted friends to ease the burden of hospitality. Replete\r\nand a trifle weary of so much good behaviour, he and his friends\r\nthreaded their way through the crowded Meadows and took up their\r\nposition on the barge, returning between second and first division\r\nfor tea. Utterly exhausted, he at last drove his patient guests to\r\nthe station and returned for dinner and uninterrupted celibacy.[15]\r\n\r\nHardly had he recovered from the social exigencies of Eights Week\r\nthan Commemoration was upon him with sterner demands, longer\r\ndrawn out. For anxious weeks he debated which balls he would\r\nattend and who should be invited to go with him; parties were\r\narranged, rooms engaged; and for one, two or three nights he\r\ndanced indefatigably from nine till five or six, then shivered in\r\na wind-swept quadrangle or on the pavement outside the Town Hall\r\nwhile he surrendered to the undergraduate herd-instinct of being\r\ncommemoratively photographed. Then, perhaps, he would go to bed\r\nfor a few hours, rising wearily to take part in a picnic on the\r\nCher and returning in time to dress for the next ball, and the more\r\nconscientious sort--hosts and guests alike--would insist on being\r\npresent at the Encænia.[16]\r\n\r\nBefore Commemoration is over, many were laying their plans for\r\nHenley. After that, the pleasure-lovers went to London for the last\r\nweeks of the season; and, for the serious workers, the coming of\r\nAugust marked the beginning of a long ten weeks of uninterrupted\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nSo from term to term and year to year. Every summer carried away\r\nthe older friends, every autumn brought a new draft to take their\r\nplace. With time came better rooms and perhaps greater dignity of\r\nposition; a man worked through the lower offices of various clubs\r\nand succeeded in time to the chair; he woke to find himself a\r\nsenior member of the college, setting to freshmen the tone which\r\nhad been set to him in his own first year. With abrupt suddenness\r\nhe discovered that he must begin looking for digs. out of college;\r\nif he had idled or overspent his allowance, he would perhaps retire\r\nto a distant monastic cell to retrench or work; otherwise he looked\r\nfor good rooms near the House and a friend to share them with him.\r\n\r\nLife out of college diminishes the sense that a man is a living,\r\nbreathing part of a community which wakes to life in hall, common\r\nroom and cathedral, if indeed it is not always awake in the\r\nquadrangle. So long as he is back in digs... by midnight, there are\r\nfew restrictions on his liberty; he can entertain, he can get up\r\nand go to bed when he likes, he can see as much or as little of the\r\ncollege as he chooses. And, with comfortable digs.., an excellent\r\ncook and work which swells like a banking cloud as his schools\r\napproach, there are many temptations to stay at home and only\r\nto visit the college for Sunday evening chapel, hall and a club\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nThe last year, for those who find time to think, is depressing,\r\nfor they are watching the O.U.D.S. or the House Grind for the last\r\ntime, and the menace of their final schools throws a gloom over\r\neverything. Some of the subjects are being read for the first time;\r\nothers, that seemed to have been mastered two years before, are\r\nnow almost wholly forgotten; losing confidence, a man speaks of\r\nhimself as \"lucky to scrape a fourth,\" he grows fatalistic and\r\nsays that he does not care; and his tutor wisely sends him away for\r\na few days' holiday and reestablishes his confidence with a word of\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nThen for a week he faces his examiners, two papers a day, three\r\nhours for each paper; and at the end, when they have laid him bare,\r\nhe cares very little indeed for any other result than that he will\r\nprobably never again be compelled to study English political or\r\nconstitutional history, political economy and economic history,\r\npolitical science and European history, a special subject or even a\r\nmodern language. The taut nerves become of a sudden very slack.\r\n\r\nAnd then it has to be realised that within a week all will be over.\r\n\r\nOne last Commemoration. A day or two of unbearable farewells.\r\nInstructions for the packing of books and pictures which he had\r\nunpacked so very lately, yet at the distant other end of his Oxford\r\ncareer. And then that overwhelming day when a man drives to the\r\nstation and, as the train gathers speed, looks for the last time\r\non Tom Tower. He will come back again, no doubt, but no longer as\r\na resident undergraduate; the Kingdom of the Young has passed to\r\nanother dynasty. In three or four years he has progressed, in age,\r\nfrom boy to man; but the development has been chiefly intellectual,\r\nand, for all his greater knowledge and experience, he has changed\r\nlittle in character or essential instincts. The rigour of school\r\ndiscipline has been relaxed, because it is no longer needed; but\r\nthe simple school ideals of honour and loyalty, restraint and\r\nself-control, clean living and hard condition remain unaltered. Had\r\nhe chosen to defy opinion and to disdain the protection with which\r\nOxford surrounds him, the opportunity was at hand for drinking\r\ntoo much and for getting into debt, for idling and for discarding\r\nthe fastidiousness which impels English boys to keep women at\r\na distance. There are men in every generation who will collect\r\nexperience at all costs, but at Oxford they are not regarded with\r\nadmiration: the undergraduate who drinks or boasts of his exploits\r\nwith women is voted noxious or boring or both.\r\n\r\nA month or six weeks after the end of term comes the viva; then the\r\nclass lists. In the following October the curtain is rung down for\r\nmost, when they meet again--and, perhaps, for the last time--to\r\nreceive the grace of their college and to proceed to the degree of\r\nBachelor of Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLONDON AND ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\n  \"... These homes, this valley spread below me here,\r\n  The rooks, the tilted stacks, the beasts in pen,\r\n  Have been the heartfelt things, past-speaking dear\r\n  To unknown generations of dead men,\r\n\r\n  Who, century after century, held these farms,\r\n  And, looking out to watch the changing sky,\r\n  Heard, as we heard, the rumours and alarms\r\n  Of war at hand and danger pressing nigh.\r\n\r\n  And knew, as we know, that the message meant\r\n  The breaking off of ties, the loss of friends,\r\n  Death, like a miser getting in his rent,\r\n  And no new stones laid where the trackway ends.\r\n\r\n  The harvest not yet won, the empty bin,\r\n  The friendly horses taken from the stalls,\r\n  The fallow on the hill not yet brought in,\r\n  The cracks unplastered in the leaking walls.\r\n\r\n  Yet heard the news, and went discouraged home,\r\n  And brooded by the fire with heavy mind,\r\n  With such dumb loving of the Berkshire loam\r\n  As breaks the dumb hearts of the English kind,\r\n\r\n  Then sadly rose and left the well-loved Downs,\r\n  And so by ship to sea, and knew no more\r\n  The fields of home, the byres, the market towns,\r\n  Nor the dear outline of the English shore,\r\n\r\n  But knew the misery of the soaking trench,\r\n  The freezing in the rigging, the despair\r\n  In the revolting second of the wrench\r\n  When the blind soul is flung upon the air,\r\n\r\n  And died (uncouthly, most) in foreign lands\r\n  For some idea but dimly understood\r\n  Of an English city never built by hands\r\n  Which love of England prompted and made good....\"\r\n\r\n                                 JOHN MASEFIELD: _August_, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhatever the success of English public schools and universities\r\nin training the sons of the wealthier classes for their part in\r\nthe professional and public life of the country, one result of an\r\neducational system which takes charge of a boy at seven or eight\r\nand releases him only at twenty-one or twenty-two is that he\r\nenters upon his adult life and work later than the young men of\r\nother countries, including those which impose a term of military\r\nservice. As all but a negligible few in England have to earn their\r\nown livings and as several years of preparation are required before\r\nthe barristers, doctors or solicitors are qualified to practise\r\nand before artists, politicians or men of business are of any use\r\nin their calling, the English also make their entry into public\r\naffairs later than other nations; they also marry later, but, as\r\nthe climate of England does not necessitate early marriage for men,\r\nthis influences the lives of the women more deeply and goes some\r\nway towards explaining the social and psychological position of\r\ngirls who remain unmarried for some years after they are ripe for\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nWhile the value of general experience, gained in other parts of\r\nthe world, may outweigh that of the technique, the atmosphere and\r\nthe moods of parliament, gained from within, it is indisputable\r\nthat most young men cannot enter the House of Commons even if\r\nthey wish.[17] On leaving Oxford, those who had not to earn their\r\nliving entered the army or returned to manage their estates; the\r\npoliticians dispersed for the most part to the Temple, to Fleet\r\nStreet and to the City, there to forget that they were politicians\r\nuntil they had mastered the business of making themselves\r\nindependent. And a few spent the whole or a part of the next years\r\nin acting as _aides-de-camp_ to colonial governors or in travelling\r\nprivately for the study of imperial and foreign conditions.\r\n\r\nThose who remained in London and those who periodically returned\r\nthither in the five years before the war alike discovered that they\r\nwere in a new imperial Rome in a new silver age. All who had waited\r\nfor the passing of Victorianism were rewarded for their patience\r\nby finding a vacuum which they were free to fill in what way\r\nsoever they chose; and to the task they brought unbounded energy,\r\nalmost unbounded wealth, a vigorous dislike of restraint and an\r\ningenuous ignorance of tradition. Never, in the recorded history\r\nof England, has the social power of money been greater; never has\r\nthe pursuit of pleasure been more widespread and successful; never\r\nhas the daily round of the educated and reflective, of the wealthy\r\nand influential, of the stolid and slow been brought nearer to\r\nthe feverishness, the superficiality and the recklessness which\r\ncharacterized one section--but one only--of the French in the years\r\nimmediately before the first revolution.\r\n\r\nUntil his receptivity and taste for mild excitement became blunted,\r\na young bachelor, who found in London at this time an indefinite\r\nprolongation of his most careless and gregarious undergraduate\r\nmood, could contrive to divert himself with enviably little effort:\r\none dance was, indeed, very like another, the only difference\r\nbetween two _débutantes_ was that of name, and--like Disraeli's\r\nyoung exquisite--he might come to relish bad wine as a relief from\r\nthe monotony of excellence; but, before he grew jaded, there was\r\nnothing, save a substitute for his own attendance, with which his\r\nhostesses refused to provide him. Morning after morning, in those\r\nspacious years, brought to his bedside a thick pile of invitations;\r\nas he breakfasted and dressed, his telephone was only released by\r\none anxious friend in order that another might use it; luncheons\r\nand dinners, theatres and operas, balls and week-end parties poured\r\ndown upon him in promiscuous welcome. The enervating suspicion\r\nthat he was achieving a personal triumph by being passed from\r\nhouse to house and from list to list was quickly dissipated when\r\nhe recognised himself as one of six men whom his dinner hostess\r\nhad pledged herself to bring; but his self-respect could always be\r\nrestored by the reflection that, if his entertainers were solely\r\nconcerned to collect so many male heads, he himself only wanted a\r\nplace where he could smoke, dance and sup between the moment of\r\nleaving the theatre and the moment of going to bed. Every one was\r\nthe gainer by his presence.\r\n\r\nWhile the excess of demand over supply set a premium on young\r\nbachelors, it forced down the value of those who entertained them\r\nand drove entertaining to a lasting discount. In 1910, a few of the\r\nVictorians still left cards at the houses where they had dined; by\r\n1914, the custom was suspect as a weak admission of thankfulness;\r\nand, when the gracious days of the great small courtesies were\r\nvoted obsolete, an uncaring telephone invitation from the lips of a\r\nbutler was inevitably met by an acceptance or a refusal as careless\r\nof even formal obligation. The despised prim decorum of Victorian\r\nsocial intercourse was replaced by head-hunting on the one side\r\nand by moss-trooping on the other; and, as, in three years, there\r\nwas more entertaining and less hospitality in London than in any\r\nother part of the world, so there was also less gratitude and more\r\ngreed. The young girl with social gifts, and the young man without,\r\nwere not only enabled but encouraged to live from Tuesday until\r\nFriday at the expense of those whom they would have disdained to\r\ncall their friends; and the parasite had by no means exhausted\r\nthe flow of hospitality when he bade farewell to his party in the\r\nearly hours of Saturday morning. If he played golf, lawn-tennis\r\nand bridge, if he played any one of them, if--playing no games of\r\nany kind--he could satisfy his hostess that he would be content to\r\nslumber in the country for two nights and a day, he would receive\r\nmore invitations than he could use.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the engaging or tragic folly of the æsthetes, in the literary\r\nand artistic adventures of the nineties, in the blatancy and\r\narrogance of the new imperialism, the death-knell of the Victorian\r\nage was sounded before the death of Queen Victoria. Between the\r\nend of the South African war and the outbreak of hostilities with\r\nGermany, there was time for the whole face of English social life\r\nto be changed.\r\n\r\nThere was time, and there was a will. English society, so defiant\r\nof definition, had hitherto been founded on an aggregate of\r\nfamilies deriving their influence from landed estates and made\r\nsensible of their obligations by their territorial position. The\r\noriginal nucleus was gradually increased by recruits from among\r\nthose who made fortunes in commerce or rose to a commanding\r\nposition in politics or the public services; but the new blood\r\nfiltered in so sparingly that it was absorbed and transmuted by the\r\nold. The existing order was not threatened until the personality\r\nand power of those who clamoured without the gate exceeded the\r\nresistance of those who wilted within.\r\n\r\nThe balance of strength began to be reversed when one of the\r\nperiodical waves of new riches coincided with a sharp depreciation\r\nin the old media of wealth: the industrial millionaire, the Rand\r\nmagnate, the American heiress and the cosmopolitan Jew, hitherto\r\nsuspect and shy, made a simultaneous appearance at a time when to\r\nthe afflictions of agricultural depression was added the capital\r\ntaxation of the Harcourt death duties. Welcomed by the most august\r\nand forced upon the most repellent, new and alien faces appeared\r\nat Cowes, on the turf and at Covent Garden; new names among the\r\nbirthday honours and in the list of those who rented grouse-moors.\r\nFaced with the choice of marrying money or of economising and doing\r\nwithout it, the old aristocracy of land crossed its blood with the\r\nnew aristocracy of commerce, hoping no doubt that the system by\r\nwhich isolated newcomers had been tamed would prevail to convert\r\nthe barbarian host in companies and to baptise it in platoons. On\r\neither side lessons were given and received; but, while interest\r\nurged the stranger to acquire ready-made an air of breeding, the\r\nfading memory of a waning prestige could not preserve to the older\r\nsociety the arbitrament in manners which it had held unchallenged\r\nbefore this surrender to wealth.\r\n\r\nA few families resisted the lure and kept their doors straitly\r\nbarred; but, as Dane-gelt, instead of buying security for English\r\nsoil, only tempted more Danes in search of more gold, so the first,\r\npartial capitulation brought more invaders with ever more and more\r\ngold to offer in exchange for a slice of England. As influence\r\nand importance were focussed on money and no longer on land,\r\npower shifted from the landed estates to London; the steadying\r\nresponsibilities of a territorial position, which was already\r\nthreatened by subversive democratic ideals, were allowed to dwindle.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the South African war London had become a\r\ncosmopolitan place of entertainment with more money, a greater\r\nzest for pleasure, a larger proportion of sycophants and a weaker\r\ncontrol by any recognized group of social leaders than any other\r\nEuropean capital. The first flood of Rand, Jewish, American\r\nand native commercial wealth, which had been at least in part\r\nunobtrusively absorbed, was followed by a second flood which\r\nEnglish society was still too much saturated to take in; and for a\r\ndozen years the tottering sea-wall of society was buffeted by angry\r\nand uncontrolled waves of wealth. As the new rich of those days had\r\nabandoned one social sphere without establishing their position\r\nin another, their first task was to surround themselves with men\r\nand women who would accept their hospitality and mitigate their\r\nsolitude; a few impoverished promoters furnished lists of eligible\r\nnames; money and the amenities of the big hotels, which were then\r\nspringing up in London, accomplished the rest. During those years\r\nthere was on one side a steady stream of rich newcomers who asked\r\nonly that their parties should be well attended; on the other, a\r\nstream no less steady of those who saw in this opportunity the\r\nfinger of God.\r\n\r\nA temporary check was imposed in 1910, when the sudden death\r\nof King Edward plunged the country into mourning, but in 1911\r\nLondon crowded two seasons into one. Perhaps there was a fear that\r\nthe new reign would usher in simpler manners and a more austere\r\nway of life, perhaps the pleasure-loving, who had lived for a\r\ntwelve-month, murmuring in undertones behind shuttered windows,\r\ngrudged their days of abstinence. The coronation gave legitimate\r\nexcuse for carnival; and in 1912 the fear of reaction merged into a\r\nresolve to postpone the reaction until carnival had spent itself:\r\nthe resources of the new rich, not yet exhausted, began to seem\r\ninexhaustible; and every day, by unfitting the parasites for any\r\nother life, multiplied their number. By 1913 the lust for amusement\r\nhad become constant and was whipped by a neurotic dread of\r\nanticlimax; by 1914 there was a panic feeling that this old order\r\ncould not last. Already war had rumbled distantly since Agadir;\r\ntwice in the Balkans the rumblings had given place to storms which\r\nsuggested how the suffering and ruthlessness of twentieth-century\r\nfighting would transcend all that had been known before and had\r\ndemonstrated how strong were the meshes which held all European\r\ndiplomacy involved, how weak the paper safeguard of peace. The\r\nlabour world had half risen in the great railway strike of 1911 and\r\nmight any day rise in its full strength; Ireland was at the mercy\r\nof two lawless armies; and the government was powerless even to\r\nprevent a determined body of women, already opposed by overwhelming\r\npublic opinion, from breaking windows and burning churches.\r\n\r\n\"How long, O Lord?\" asked one.\r\n\r\n\"Après moi, le deluge; mais après le deluge ...?\" asked another.\r\n\r\nAnd in the first week of August, 1914, the cynics who had been\r\nwatching the growth of hostility between classes agreed that, if\r\nthere had been no war, it would have been necessary to create one.\r\n\r\nThese were the mad, neurotic years of private horseplay and public\r\nlawlessness, when no hoax was too gigantic, no folly too laborious\r\nto be undertaken for a wager and when ill-conditioned defiance led\r\nevery class in the land to proclaim that, if it disliked a law,\r\nit would disobey it. They were days of great costume-balls, of\r\nfreak dinners and of nascent night-clubs. Perhaps they are best\r\nregarded as the years which, of all in recent times, the ingrained\r\npuritanism of the English would most gladly forget.\r\n\r\nUnder the shock of war it became fashionable to look upon this\r\nwanton life as an offence to God, which the scourge of God was\r\nbeing used to end; and from an audience whose heart is not yet\r\nhealed the satirist of those years can always be sure of applause.\r\nIt is easy to paint too glittering a picture and to foster a new\r\nsense of superiority which is not justified. For a dozen years\r\nbefore the war there was much ostentation and polite mendicancy,\r\nmuch frivolity of head and vulgarity of soul among a world of\r\nmerrymakers who had been born without a feeling for responsibility\r\nor who had shaken off the restraints of tradition. Was their crime\r\nmore grave than that?\r\n\r\nEvery vulgarian must be vulgar in his own way; so long as the\r\ninstitution of private property continues, rich and poor are\r\nequally free to misspend their money; and, though they differed\r\nin their means and in their tastes, rich and poor were equally\r\nguilty of waste, display, lawlessness and sloth; a just sumptuary\r\nlaw would have borne as hardly on one as on the other. In the\r\nabsence of a civic conscience, all struggled to obtain the maximum\r\nof personal enjoyment with the minimum of exertion, protesting\r\nself-righteously the while against the idleness and improvidence\r\nof their neighbours; and, if the poor murmured at the misuse\r\nof surplus wealth, the rich were sometimes amazed at their own\r\nmoderation in not resenting the sight of so much leisure with so\r\nlittle taxation among the working classes.\r\n\r\nWhile those who mocked at the primness and overthrew the decorum of\r\nthe Victorian era constructed a social system which to Irish eyes\r\nseemed intolerably vulgar and mercenary, it may be pleaded that the\r\nnew and alien arbiters of taste, lacking any tradition of breeding,\r\ncould hardly be expected to know any better and that Providence\r\nwould surely have made allowances for this before unloosing the\r\nscourge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe breach between Victorianism and that which succeeded it was not\r\nmore complete in manners than in art and literature. By the time\r\nthat King George V ascended the throne, the great lights of the\r\npreceding century were, almost without exception, flickering out\r\nor already extinguished; those who survived the transition in time\r\nwere none the less influenced so deeply by the change in atmosphere\r\nthat their later work differs from the earlier as much as one man's\r\nfrom another's. This is so much more than the normal advance from\r\nyouth to maturity that it suggests a revaluation, a new point of\r\nview and a reaction to changed psychological conditions without.\r\nWhile Kipling's art as a supreme story-teller attained by natural\r\ndevelopment to a rarer perfection, his change of standpoint may\r\nbe measured by the distance from any one of the _Plain Tales_ to\r\n_They_ or _The Brushwood Boy_; with Conrad the change is from\r\n_Nostromo_ to _Chance_; with James from _The Wings of a Dove_ to\r\n_The Awkward Age_.\r\n\r\nThe younger men, untrammelled by memories of what they had tried to\r\nexpress in a previous incarnation, worked with a freedom of which\r\nthey only became conscious when they paused to compare it with\r\nthe restrictions under which their predecessors laboured. It has\r\nbeen said that, in the early nineties, _The Second Mrs. Tanqueray_\r\nopened a new chapter in dramatic history; when it was reproduced a\r\ndozen years later, it hardly seemed, for all its skill and power,\r\nso daring as before; and, if it were reproduced again to-day after\r\nanother dozen years, the younger critics would doubtless continue\r\nto praise its technique, but they might be unable to realise its\r\npsychology. In 1920 it is felt to be surprising that any one\r\nshould bother when a man marries his mistress; that she should\r\ncommit suicide when another old lover comes back into her life is\r\ninconceivable: to the modern playwright that is not a dramatic\r\ntheme worthy of his mettle, to the modern English world that is not\r\na problem to cause more than passing embarrassment to any one.\r\n\r\nWhether England has become morally more lax or merely less reticent\r\nabout its laxity is a problem which no one can solve; but the\r\ngreatest change that has overtaken literature and art in the last\r\ntwenty years is in the new freedom to choose any theme and to\r\ntreat it by any method. The plays of Shaw and the novels of Wells\r\nhad embraced every subject from brothels and baldness to God and\r\ngunpowder-factories, from patent medicine and politics to love and\r\nlinen-drapery. The form of the medium has changed as profoundly\r\nas the content; the play and the novel have been made an avowed\r\nplatform for the dramatic or narrative discussion of any thesis\r\nthat interests the author at any given moment.\r\n\r\nThis new emancipation has been accompanied by a new receptivity,\r\nwelcome at first and only dangerous when criticism seeks to\r\nnavigate without a compass; a new willingness to explore unfamiliar\r\nspaces and to experiment with new instruments. The twenty years\r\nwhich have passed since Queen Victoria's death have seen the\r\nliterary birth, development or at least general recognition of a\r\ncompany so varied as Synge and Barker, Housman and Yeats, De Morgan\r\nand Galsworthy, Masefield and Rabindranath Tagore, to take but a\r\nfew; it has seen translations of Russian novels and Chinese lyrics,\r\nof Belgian mystical essays and Scandinavian realistic plays; there\r\nis no form of literature, whatever its atmosphere and language, to\r\nwhich a hearing has been refused.\r\n\r\nNor is this merely an Athenian craving for something new. All--and\r\nperhaps more than all--that was worth rescuing of Oscar Wilde's\r\nperverse wit was restored to circulation as soon as the English had\r\nsatisfied their love for a legal separation between art and morals;\r\nSamuel Butler was one of several to enjoy a posthumous vogue; and,\r\nif the other heroes were rearranged in the national pantheon, many\r\nwere brought into prominence who had long languished in obscurity.\r\nThis period saw an immense flood of cheap reprints issuing from a\r\ndozen different publishers; more experiments were tried on more\r\nShakespearean plays than ever before; and theatrical societies\r\nproduced Elizabethan and Restoration dramas which had been left\r\nlong unplayed.\r\n\r\nThese years were enriched by two repertory seasons at the Court and\r\nDuke of York's Theatres, in which some of the maturest work of Shaw\r\nand Barker, Galsworthy and Barrie was seen; and the Abbey Theatre\r\ncompany came annually from Dublin to delight new audiences with\r\nsome of the greatest comedies, the greatest tragedy and the finest\r\nteamwork in acting that had been seen in London for a generation.\r\nAs a rule, however, the stage was more fortunate in what it\r\nrevived than in what it presented for the first time; dramatic\r\nliterature has lagged so far behind other forms that playwrights\r\nwould compose and managers produce what no conscientious novelist\r\nor self-respecting publisher dared to expose for sale. The level\r\nof acting, too, was no higher than might be expected in a country\r\nwhere actors and actresses \"starred\" on the strength of a single\r\npart and continued in one groove, with plays written down to them,\r\nbecause they had not endured the discipline of a diversified early\r\ntraining. To suggest that the English get the drama that they\r\ndeserve would be unfair to a nation which, on the whole and with\r\nstartling exceptions, enjoys and supports the rare good plays\r\noffered to it; yet there rests unexplained the mystery that,\r\nalthough the dramatic is the most lucrative form of writing,\r\nalthough managers and public were clamouring for plays, although\r\nthe theatres were filled with erotic comedies, brain-saving revues,\r\nemasculated French farces, clattering American melodramas and\r\nperverse, senile sentimentalities, there were not in these years\r\nmore than three British playwrights who could be trusted to give a\r\nrecognisable representation of life.\r\n\r\nThe mystery is deepened by the fact that, during the same period,\r\nthe English, who accept with resignation if not with pride the\r\nstigma of being unmusical, crowded a lifetime of musical progress\r\ninto a few years. Covent Garden has always been a battleground\r\nbetween those who wish to hear the greatest number of the most\r\ninteresting operas in their best rendering and those who find a box\r\nand the second half of a tuneful banality the best place and time\r\nfor meeting again the friends whom they have not seen since dinner.\r\nFor a generation the two armies existed amicably side by side on\r\na compromise by which the music-lovers secured that, whatever the\r\nopera, it should be competently given and the others conceded\r\nthat it might be competently given so long as no experiments or\r\ninnovations were made. Year after year the hackneyed _Rigolettos_\r\nand _Lohengrins_, the _Traviatas_ and _Tannhaüsers_ soothed the\r\nconservative hearing of any one whose musical education had been\r\narrested in childhood; from time to time the _Ring_ was given, but\r\nthe inordinate length of each part provided a plausible excuse\r\nfor those who stayed at home, and a martyr's crown or at least a\r\nvictor's laurel for those who attended.\r\n\r\nThen, without warning, the new artistic receptivity spread to\r\nmusic, and a trial was offered to new men and to new works. _Der\r\nRosenkavalier_ and _Elektra_ were given in those years; _Parsifal_\r\nwas played for the first time in England; and all whose knowledge\r\nof ballet was limited to the Empire and Adeline Genée found\r\nthemselves led to a mountain-top and invited to regard the new\r\nworld wherein Pavlova and Mordken, Karsavina and Nijinski lorded\r\nit. With the Russian ballet and under the shadow of war came the\r\nRussian opera; and, while the old repertory was played at Covent\r\nGarden, a new ecstacy was offered at Drury Lane by _Prince Igor_,\r\n_Boris Godounov_ and _Ivan le terrible_. With the Russian opera\r\ncame an artist whose admirers have not yet determined whether he\r\nis greater as a singer or as an actor, though they agree that as a\r\ncombination of the two he is the greatest figure on any operatic\r\nstage in the world. The incomparable voice and superb presence of\r\nChaliapin blew a new vigour of youth and a new conception of beauty\r\ninto the stale dust of the London theatre.\r\n\r\nThough the spirit of the emancipation breathed also on the\r\ngraphic and the plastic arts, as yet its breath has produced only\r\nintoxication. For ten years one experiment has succeeded another,\r\none school has hustled another out of the way; and the artists\r\nwhom the public is enjoined to admire of a morning are devoured\r\nby their own children in the afternoon. Beyond a contempt for the\r\nacademic and a revolt from the traditional--not always supported by\r\ntechnical proficiency in the method rejected--the impressionists\r\nand post-impressionists, the cubists, vorticists and dadaists have\r\nnot made plain the goal of their exploration and as yet, though\r\nthey have formulated new theories of art, they have not achieved a\r\nnew beauty. As, in the reaction from Victorian stiffness, social\r\nemancipation led to a gilded hooliganism, so, in graphic art,\r\nthe reaction from the strictness of the pre-Raphaelites led to\r\nchaotic lawlessness. If all England went mad for five years before\r\nthe war, her madness is registered, though--it may be hoped--not\r\nimmortalised, in the painting of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt was in these years of change and upheaval that the men of the\r\nvanished generation served their apprenticeship and came to first\r\ngrips with life. Their fathers and grandfathers, seeing England\r\nriven by a new political dispensation, had acquiesced grudgingly\r\nin the transference of power without seeking to understand the\r\naspirations of the newly emancipated millions and without striving\r\nto create a new and united community. The fact of social, economic\r\nand racial antagonism, impressed upon them as the legacy of\r\nthe French revolution by a hundred years of riots, strikes and\r\nwars, came to be buttressed in the middle of the century by a\r\nbiological doctrine which taught that antagonism of beast to beast\r\nand of man to man, of class to class and of creed to creed, of\r\nnation to nation and of hunger, cold and pestilence to all was an\r\neternal and ineluctable decree of nature. It was easier to repeat\r\nhalf-comprehended phrases about a struggle for existence and the\r\nsurvival of the fittest than to attack the disorder which is the\r\nineluctable and eternal result of antagonism.\r\n\r\nAfter a hundred years of ill-will and dissension, a new generation\r\narose to protest against the confusion of this endless antagonism.\r\nImpatience with disorder, hatred of ugliness and preoccupation\r\nwith the government of man by man--a normal part of youth's mental\r\nequipment--were stimulated in the dawn of the twentieth century by\r\nthe literary challenge of each year: in play after play Bernard\r\nShaw was attacking some social abuse with the penetration of an\r\nold controversialist, the ferocity of a fanatic and the wit of\r\nan Irishman; in novel after novel H. G. Wells cried out on the\r\nslovenly thinking and spiritual laziness which barred beauty and\r\norder from life; and in play after play and novel after novel John\r\nGalsworthy pleaded for gentleness and explored with unanswerable\r\nquestions the place where a civic conscience should have been. At\r\nno time since the days of the _philosophes_ has literature been so\r\nmuch engrossed with the shortcomings of civilisation; at no time\r\nhas it appealed so fervently nor experimented so widely. The waking\r\ndream of beauty was reinforced more than ever before by a sense\r\nof personal responsibility; and a higher proportion of the young\r\nmen from twenty-two to twenty-seven were waiting only until they\r\nwere equipped to undertake it. With a background of new ethical\r\nstandards and of new political ideals, in an atmosphere of artistic\r\nexperiment and of social revolt, amid a shifting social population\r\nand an unceasing redistribution of wealth, under the menace of\r\nwar abroad and of revolution at home, they first measured their\r\nstrength against the difficulties of the career that each had\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nBetween 1909 and 1914 a few married; but, as the necessity for\r\nearning a living was their first concern in those days, the\r\nmajority were for the present as much debarred from matrimony as\r\nfrom public life. A few went utterly to pieces, ranging in their\r\ndownfall from the squalor of touting among their friends for\r\ninsignificant loans to the supreme waste of suicide. One or two\r\nflashed meteorically to the highest plane of their professions.\r\nThe rest followed an average course and in diplomacy or in the\r\ncivil service, in the army or in holy orders, in commerce or at the\r\nbar, in medicine or in journalism worked with what patience they\r\ncould muster through the unproductive years of early plodding. By\r\n1914 the original fortunate three or four who had entered public\r\nlife as soon as they came down from Oxford were reinforced by a\r\ndozen more who had made enough progress in five years to fight an\r\nelection or at least to nurse a constituency; and five years were\r\nlong enough to enable the rest to decide whether they had made\r\nwise choice of a career. Some of those who had been called to the\r\nbar now abandoned their wearisome inactivity in order to make a\r\nlivelihood in the City; the young soldiers who had been sent into\r\nthe army to be kept out of mischief now assumed that they had\r\nreached years of discretion and resigned their commissions; and any\r\none who had obstinately cherished the ambition of a literary life\r\nmight well, after five years, be deemed incurable.\r\n\r\nIt was the fate characteristic of nearly all that generation that,\r\nas their training neared completion, they were called away for\r\never from the work for which they had been trained and lost to the\r\npeaceful service of mankind. By 1914 their seniors had completed\r\ntheir apprenticeship and made their transition; though their\r\nuprooting was greater, they had at least found for a moment their\r\nplace in the uncaring void. The apprenticeship of their juniors\r\nhad not yet begun: they passed from school or university to their\r\nwar-service, and the survivors postponed until the end of the war\r\ntheir practical preparation for civic life. This is not to say that\r\none is to be envied more than another; in every country at the\r\noutbreak of every war, one generation is more violently dislocated\r\nthan the rest; when all loss of life is waste of a nation's\r\nresources, it may be felt that the most grievous waste is among\r\nthose who have completed their scholastic education and prepared\r\nthemselves for work which they can never fulfil. \"Childhood makes\r\nthe instrument, youth tunes the strings, and early manhood\r\nplays the melody.\" The vanished generation never played upon the\r\ninstrument; it was hardly tuned before it was struck to the ground,\r\nand music of another kind was heard.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to speculate how much the loss has cost humanity; to\r\nthe men in the middle twenties at least as much as to the men of\r\nany age it was left to pay for the madness of the world and the\r\ncrimes of its rulers. They were at the summit of their physical\r\ncondition; their spirit and training carried them unfalteringly\r\ninto the war; and, enrolling themselves in the first days, they\r\nsupported the chief burden of a game in which the odds lengthened\r\nagainst them with every hour of immunity. A strange marching-song\r\nsent them to their death: strident and shrill cries of impatience\r\nwith everything, revolt against everything; catches of crooning\r\nwaltz and clattering rag-time to bring back memories and to twist\r\nhearts; the craving for excitement and the whimper of fretfulness;\r\nthe sigh of a world in despair heard in the silent pause of mankind\r\nbewildered; all blended their notes to a thunder of confusion,\r\nbanishing thought. The onlookers cried in rival tumult that this,\r\nat all events, would be the last war in history; and an echo of\r\ntheir consoling philosophy carried to the departing troops and, in\r\nthe belief that this was a war to end war, furnished them at last\r\nwith a ready explanation of their going.\r\n\r\nA few perhaps wondered why war could only be ended by war and\r\nwhether this was indeed the last war; hardly any one risked the\r\nodium of penetrating official propaganda in order to enquire why\r\nwar had been made possible, though some liberals searched their\r\nhearts to discover how the historic peace-party of Great Britain,\r\nelected on other issues and periodically fed on professions of\r\ngood-will, had been persuaded in a day to honour, by payment in\r\nflesh and blood, international obligations whose existence the\r\ngovernment had more than once denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FRINGE OF POLITICS\r\n\r\n \"It makes all the difference in the world whether we put Truth in\r\n the first place or in the second place.\"\r\n\r\n                 WHATELEY (quoted by Lord Morley in _Compromise_).\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThough by the outbreak of war, their progress towards the House\r\nof Commons had brought but few of the younger politicians to a\r\nconstituency and fewer still to a contested election, a great\r\npart of the years from 1909 until 1914 was inevitably taken up by\r\npolitical studies in a highly-charged atmosphere. The controversies\r\nof that time were waged with a bitterness of which the straitest\r\nrecluse could not remain unaware; and the unsated passions of\r\nWestminster were carried to Pall Mall and fed to new inspiration in\r\nthe adjoining, ever-open temples of the two great parties.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Club, own sister to Bridgewater House, standing between\r\nthe Travellers' and the Carlton, is the home constructed by Sir\r\nCharles Barry for the supporters of the reform act of 1832 and\r\nfor their successors. A necessary qualification for membership is\r\nthat the candidate shall be a \"reformer\", though the rules do not\r\nindicate whether it is sufficient for him to support the reform of\r\nthe divorce law or of the tariff; and until 1886 a reformer and a\r\nliberal were synonymous. After the home rule split of that year,\r\nthe Gladstonians in this as in every liberal club blackballed\r\na Hartingtonite candidate, the Hartingtonites blackballed a\r\nGladstonian candidate, and both combined to blackball an uncertain\r\ncandidate till a truce had to be declared if the club was to\r\nsurvive. In the headquarters of the liberal party, so loveless a\r\nunion was doomed to a short life; when incompatibility of temper\r\npassed beyond patience and hope, judgement was given for the home\r\nrulers; and, though a few of the unionists kept their names on\r\nthe books, the majority of the seceders drew daily closer to the\r\nconservative party, and the club once more became the headquarters\r\nof liberalism.\r\n\r\nSo it has remained to this day; and the chief party meetings,\r\nsuch as that in December 1916 when Mr. Asquith announced to his\r\nfollowers the resignation of the first coalition, take place within\r\nits walls; though mercifully free from the control of the party\r\nwhips, it is still to liberalism very much what the Carlton is to\r\nconservatism; a liberal member of Parliament takes precedence of\r\nother candidates in the order of election; and the only problem\r\nthat can now perplex the club is the old question, \"What is a\r\nliberal?\" and the new rider, \"Who is leader of the liberal party?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that the conditions of life in even the\r\noldest and most famous clubs could escape the social revolution\r\nwhich was observable before the war and which the war accelerated.\r\nFor several years before 1914 the peculiar glory of club life\r\nin London was coming to be regarded as one of London's departed\r\nglories: the parsimonious father no longer automatically entered\r\nhis infant son's name for five or six clubs, the impatient\r\ncandidate was no longer content to linger indefinitely in the upper\r\nreaches of a waiting-list, and the growing absence of restraint\r\nin all social relationships broke out into intolerance of the\r\ncrusted conservatism to which young members of other days had\r\nsubmitted uncomplainingly. The war, in checking the normal flow of\r\nfresh blood, caused some clubs to waste and die, others to turn a\r\nmore anæmic scrutiny on the qualifications of their candidates;\r\nand, with the coming of peace, the cry has again been heard that\r\neven the most historic institutions must modernize themselves or\r\nforfeit the allegiance of those who require a place where they can\r\nplay squash racquets and invite women to meals. It is so doubtful\r\nwhether club life will ever regain its Victorian popularity and\r\nprestige that a student of changing manners may perhaps be forgiven\r\nfor halting to uncover at the sound of one more passing bell.\r\n\r\nAs the nebulous quality of being a reformer is the sole positive\r\nrequirement of a candidate for the Reform Club, the membership is\r\nmore varied than in most. Naturally, liberal politicians abound;\r\nthe bar and civil service are well represented, but probably no\r\nassociation which is primarily political contains also quite so\r\nmany non-political elements. From the days of Thackeray and James\r\nPayn to those of H. G. Wells and Arnold Bennett it has always bound\r\na spell on men of letters: Henry James had a bedroom there in his\r\nlater years; and novelists, whether or no they can boast the honour\r\nof membership, alike seem unable to keep it out of their novels.\r\nJules Verne laid the first and last scenes of _Round the World in\r\nEighty Days_ in the card-room of the club, and it is chastening for\r\na vegetarian to reflect that in those virile days your reformer\r\nbreakfasted succulently off steaks and chops; it is impossible not\r\nto suspect more than one sly description in some of H. G. Wells'\r\nlater novels, while in _Marriage_--beyond doubt or cavil--one\r\ncharacter leaves the ice and idealism of Labrador, if not for\r\nthe flesh-pots of the Reform Club, at least with the knowledge\r\nthat \"pressed beef, such as they'll give you at the Reform, too,\r\nthat's good eating for a man. With chutnee, and then old cheese to\r\nfollow....\"\r\n\r\nFrom a corner of the Reform Club young political aspirants had an\r\nunrivalled opportunity of watching for ten years the history of\r\nliberalism in the making. With hardly an exception the ministers\r\nwere all members; and most of them used the club regularly.\r\nThe great liberal triumph of 1906 had brought everything but\r\nhomogeneity: there was enthusiasm, authority and numbers, but there\r\nwas also suspicion and a memory of old feuds. The Liberal Leaguers,\r\nit was generally believed, would have liked to banish Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman to the House of Lords; but both he and his\r\nbacking of nonconformist radicals were too strong for them. On his\r\nresignation the liberal party presented the anomalous spectacle\r\nof a radical, peace-loving, nonconformist body with a Liberal\r\nLeague head; and the first election of 1910 was required to unify\r\nthe party. In the cabinet and in the House of Commons there is a\r\ndifference, almost incomprehensible to those outside, between the\r\nposition of a prime minister who has succeeded to the heritage won\r\nby another and the position of a prime minister who has gone into\r\naction at the head of his army and has been invoked and acclaimed\r\nin five hundred single combats. Though he had squandered the vast\r\nmajority which Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman bequeathed to him, Mr.\r\nAsquith returned in 1910 with enhanced prestige as the leader of a\r\nparty which had gone to the polls in his name.\r\n\r\nThe years from 1906 until 1910--the \"Mad Parliament\"[18]--had been\r\nprimarily a time of political education or disillusion for the\r\nliberals who entered the House of Commons with unlimited idealism,\r\nlimited experience and unbounded ignorance of parliamentary\r\nforms. In the first flush of victory they cleared the Rand of its\r\nindentured Chinese labour and carried out the settlement of South\r\nAfrica by a grant of self-government: to such an avalanche of power\r\nthe opposition could offer no resistance, and, so long as the\r\ngovernment effected its reforms by executive action, the reserve\r\nof the old guard could not be brought up. It was when, with a\r\ncuriously negative passion for reversal, ministers tried to upset\r\nthe Taff Vale judgement and the Balfour education and licensing\r\nacts that new legislation was needed; and to new legislation the\r\nconservatives could offer an opposition to overcome the most\r\nbloated of majorities. The Birrell education bill and the new\r\nlicensing bill were destroyed by the House of Lords; the trades\r\ndisputes bill, after hanging by the neck, was cut down before it\r\nwas dead. Of the three, this was the one most open to attack in\r\nthat it placed trades unions, in some respects, above the law; it\r\nwas allowed to pass, amid salvos of abuse, because the House of\r\nLords would not then risk a direct challenge to organized labour;\r\nand this cynical opportunism discredited the Lords far more than\r\nhad their partial and reactionary assault on all bills submitted by\r\na liberal government.\r\n\r\nEither of these rebuffs constituted, in the eyes of the party\r\nstalwarts, an occasion for war; and those who remembered the\r\ndismal policy of \"filling up the cup\" in the Gladstone-Rosebery\r\nadministration yearned for a short, sharp contest in which the\r\nmalevolence of the House of Lords should be fettered for all time.\r\nNevertheless, the memory of even a successful election is so\r\nlittle alluring that the liberal majority of those days did not\r\nwish to engage in a second: the politician of detached judgement\r\nsurmised that, when the Nationalists had secured special favours\r\nfor Catholics and when all parties had united to concede them to\r\nthe Jews, it was invidious to refuse similar treatment to the\r\nChurch of England. In rejecting the education bill, the House of\r\nLords aroused little practical hostility, however much its action\r\nmay have offended doctrinaire democrats; and so artificial was the\r\ntattered passion aroused by the Balfour education act of 1902 that,\r\nwhen it ceased to furnish platform capital, it was left to function\r\nunmolested and is still operative after nearly twenty years.\r\nSimilarly, when the licensing bill was thrown out, the House of\r\nLords was so far from being reprobated by any but prohibitionists\r\nand professional partisans that it even won the sympathy of the\r\naverage man by preventing an intolerable interference with his\r\npersonal habits and by securing to the threatened license-holder\r\nhis means of living. Some such reflections, occurring even to the\r\nless detached politicians, disposed them to wait for a more certain\r\ntriumph than was promised by the half-hearted support accorded to\r\ntheir rejected bills; an opportunity was provided by the budget of\r\n1909; and Mr. Asquith's first general election of 1910 was fought\r\nto reaffirm the hitherto long unquestioned control of finance by\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIf the new liberal majority was smaller and now dependent on the\r\nnationalist vote, it was at least inspired by an unanalytical\r\nadmiration for its chief such as no prime minister had enjoyed\r\nsince the fanatical personality of Mr. Gladstone drew an equally\r\nfanatical devotion from his followers. Personal shyness and\r\nintellectual aloofness deprived Mr. Asquith of the love felt for\r\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman by all who came in contact with\r\nhim; he never pretended passionate enthusiasms nor roused in\r\nothers the passionate enthusiasm which caused Mr. Lloyd George\r\nto be cheered through a division-lobby; he was never the sole\r\nhero of a great bill as Mr. Lloyd George was the sole hero of\r\nthe 1909 budget; outside the House he never won the adoration\r\nof the proletariat as Mr. Lloyd George won--and to some extent\r\nkept--it by his Limehouse campaign; and, when fire was needed in\r\ndebate, Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Churchill was left to supply it.\r\nNevertheless, lack of temperament and limitation of heart were\r\ncompensated, in Mr. Asquith, by the unlimited ascendancy of his\r\nhead. Eloquent, emphatic, and unruffled, patient, experienced and\r\nresourceful, the intellectual and dialectical superior of the\r\noldest parliamentarian in the House and the wisest tactician on\r\neither side, a survivor from Mr. Gladstone's last cabinet and Mr.\r\nGladstone's most brilliant discovery, Mr. Asquith exacted, even\r\nfrom those who resisted him in the Liberal League days, a blind\r\nloyalty which carried him through four years of the hottest and\r\nmost unintermittent domestic fighting in English political history;\r\nit carried him, with closed ranks, into the war and through nearly\r\ntwo and a half years of the war, though many felt in their hearts\r\nthat, by the policy which made war possible, he had betrayed\r\nliberalism and that, by the unheralded formation and dissolution\r\nof the first coalition, he had betrayed the liberal party. After\r\nthe December crisis of 1916 the loyalty of his followers, with\r\ntheir English love for an old, popular favourite, insisted that he\r\nshould still remain at their head; and, when he lost his seat in\r\n1918, he retained his leadership. The general election in that year\r\nextinguished his party; it was characteristic of the men he led and\r\nof the leader they followed that, when all was lost but faith, they\r\nset loyalty to their old chief above private and public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFrom the budget crisis of 1909 until the party crisis of 1916\r\nMr. Asquith, as the Nestor first of his party and then of his\r\ncoalition, was by so much the most commanding figure in public\r\nlife that posterity seemed likely, in reading the history of those\r\nyears, to concentrate upon his name as exclusively as this age\r\nconcentrates on that of Mr. Pitt, while forgetting the names of his\r\nlieutenants as completely as the casual reader in these days has\r\nforgotten the names of Mr. Pitt's. Had he remained in office till\r\nthe armistice to enjoy the fruits of this early war-administration,\r\nhis fame would probably have transcended Mr. Pitt's, as the late\r\nwar transcended in magnitude the war against Napoleon; had he\r\nresigned voluntarily, with every honour that could be bestowed\r\nupon him, three months before the December downfall, he would have\r\nshared with his successor whatever credit history may accord to\r\nthe political leaders in the war. The time and the manner of his\r\nresignation dwarf his personality and his achievements before\r\nthose of Mr. Lloyd George as the achievements and personality\r\nof Lord Aberdeen were dwarfed before those of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\"Nothing in Mr. Asquith's career is more striking than his fall\r\nfrom power,\" writes the anonymous author of _The Mirrors of Downing\r\nStreet_; \"it was as if a pin had dropped.\"\r\n\r\nSeven years earlier he seemed to his supporters, inside the\r\nHouse and out, a leader who could wrest a party victory from\r\nthe jaws of political death. Whoever unloosed the winds, it was\r\nalways Mr. Asquith who harnessed and rode them. Thus, Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, confident that the House of Lords had, by constitutional\r\nconvention, no power to tamper with a money-bill, departed so\r\nfar from the traditional conception of the budget as a means of\r\nbalancing expenditure and revenue that the House of Lords was\r\nthreatened with loss of control over any measure which could be\r\nshielded by a financial clause. It was a bold challenge, boldly\r\naccepted; the House of Lords threw out the budget. No general\r\nelection could paralyse their powers more completely than the\r\ndevice which the chancellor of the exchequer was seeking to\r\nintroduce. With equal boldness the prime minister followed up his\r\nchallenge by advising a dissolution.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith's ministry was returned to power with authority to\r\npiece together and carry its mutilated programme, though the\r\nauthority was by now so much diminished that the opposition\r\nregarded itself and the country as lying at the mercy of a\r\nsmall and tyrannous junto: had they voted by inclination, the\r\nnationalists would have assailed the budget, but they gave their\r\nsupport as a consideration for the later help of British liberals\r\nwho indeed called themselves home rulers, but were more interested\r\nin other issues. From 1910 onwards log-rolling by groups became the\r\nfirst condition of the government's existence; and, before ever the\r\nHouse met, the whips' office was conscious of the change. Political\r\nhistory from 1910 to 1914 is the record of the government's\r\nattempts to meet its liabilities. The great bills were introduced:\r\nhome rule, Welsh disestablishment and electoral reform; they were\r\nrejected, and the parliament bill was drafted to secure that these\r\nand other bills, when passed by the House of Commons without change\r\nin three consecutive sessions, automatically became law. There\r\nwas another election, keenly resented by those who regarded it as\r\nunnecessary and complained that they had been misled by the prime\r\nminister's Albert Hall speech; and Mr. Asquith was empowered to say\r\nthat, if the House of Lords rejected the parliament bill, new peers\r\nwould be created until the government had a majority; the bill\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nAfter less than ten years, many are forgetting the political\r\npassions of those days. To a radical this contest was far the\r\ngreatest democratic victory since the first reform bill, and Mr.\r\nAsquith, after nearly twenty years, seemed to be buckling on the\r\nsword which Mr. Gladstone laid down when, in the last speech\r\ndelivered by him in the House of Commons, he warned his party of\r\nthe conflict which had been forced upon them: to an Irishman, it\r\nwas the promise of freedom and self-government. Nowhere could there\r\nbe found room for compromise, though the opposition saw only the\r\ncoming of mob-rule and confiscation, the betrayal of Ulster and the\r\nspoliation of the church. It is small wonder if war was carried to\r\nthe knife and fork, if old friendships broke, as in the days of\r\nthe first home rule bill, and if stern, unbending tories stalked\r\ndisgustedly from drawing-rooms when ministers and their families\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nMany, too, are forgetting how closely fought was the contest.\r\nBlood, it was boasted, would flow under Westminster Bridge before\r\nthe \"backwoodsmen\" gave way; the whips' office was reported to\r\nhave its lists ready, and new peers were to be created in batches\r\nuntil their opponents abandoned the futile opposition; while the\r\nfinal debate was taking place in the House of Lords, the first\r\ncommissioner was at work on the plans for converting Westminster\r\nHall into a chamber capable of seating the new creations. No one,\r\neven as the last division took place, could predict confidently how\r\nthe votes would be cast.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the government brought to an end the greatest\r\nconstitutional struggle of a century. Henceforward the will of the\r\nmajority, expressed through its representatives in the House of\r\nCommons and thrice affirmed, could no longer be withstood by the\r\nHouse of Lords in its existing or in any reformed state; for the\r\nsecond time in twenty years Ireland looked through an open door\r\nat the vision of freedom. It may be that the war, in overturning\r\nall political conditions, has caused the parliament act to be no\r\nlonger needed: the days of conflict between the two houses may\r\nhave passed away in 1914, and from the present disorder and sorrow\r\nof Ireland may emerge a settlement not less enduring than was\r\nforeshadowed in the third home rule bill; but, whether or not there\r\nbe one to mourn its death, all must recognise that the parliament\r\nact is dead, and, unless its fruits are to be secured by other\r\nmeans, it were better that it had never been born with its promise\r\nof hope and its fulfilment of despair. If war with Germany was\r\ninevitable--an hypothesis which increasing numbers find themselves\r\nunable to accept--democracy and nationalism would have fared better\r\nby its coming in 1911; if the act of God had displaced the liberal\r\nministers on the morrow of their victory, it would have been better\r\nfor their reputation and for the principles which they professed.\r\nFor a moment they and their redoubtable leader loomed big as any\r\nof the greatest parliamentary figures in history; neither Canning\r\nnor Grey, neither Palmerston nor Gladstone could shew a fairer\r\nrecord of achievement in the long battle for democracy and the\r\nuntrammelled development of small nations.\r\n\r\nIt was only for a moment. Political history from the passing of\r\nthe parliament act is the history of liberalism in its decline\r\nand fall. Were ministers exhausted by their effort? Were they\r\nmen who could only do a piece of work when it was forced upon\r\nthem? Among his great qualities it is doubtful whether the prime\r\nminister could include enthusiasm, though he worked in office with\r\nthe mechanical efficiency and speed of a hard-pressed barrister;\r\nit is certain that he could not be credited with imagination: the\r\nIrish ideal and the Ulster ideal floated at an equal distance\r\nabove the practical head of a man who had been taught and trained\r\nto distrust enthusiasm and to reject idealism. His biographer may\r\nsearch through his speeches and writings for one hint of vision\r\nor a single glimmer of sympathy with anything but material logic;\r\nhe might as profitably search through the sole published speech\r\nof Gallio and the comment of his chronicler. Want of vision was\r\ntemporarily compensated by adroitness in escaping the consequences\r\nof this defect. For the next five years, friends and enemies agreed\r\nthat there was no one to equal Mr. Asquith in his tactical retreat\r\nfrom a crisis; the enemies added that, until a crisis arose,\r\nhe never exerted himself; the friends began to wonder whether\r\nthe highest statesmanship consisted in overcoming one crisis by\r\ncreating another, by exchanging an Irish crisis for a European\r\ncrisis until, in the final crisis of December 1916, when for the\r\nlast time he bade his followers choose between Nicias and Cleon, a\r\nmajority voted for any change from the long and precarious policy\r\nof brilliant improvisations.\r\n\r\nAs an instrument of government, the liberal ministry declined\r\nin power as its prestige declined; and its prestige suffered a\r\nsevere blow on the day when the public was informed that Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, the chancellor of the exchequer, Sir Rufus Isaacs, the\r\nattorney-general, and the Master of Elibank, chief liberal whip,\r\nhad been buying American Marconi shares. The attorney-general's\r\nbrother was associated with the English company; and the more\r\ncredulous section of the public, never reluctant to learn or to\r\ninvent a scandal among the highly-placed, jumped to the conclusion\r\nthat ministers with access to information withheld from the public\r\nhad been speculating in stocks which their official position\r\nenabled them to influence in their own favour. A widespread outcry\r\narose, a commission of enquiry was set up, ministers were examined\r\nand the findings of the commissioners were published. As a cynic\r\nobserved at the time:\r\n\r\n\"The tories don't care a damn, but they have to pretend to be\r\nshocked; the liberals are shocked, but they have to pretend not to\r\ncare a damn.\"\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of excited recrimination, public interest gradually\r\ncooled; the hostile press had to admit that there had been no\r\ncorruption, however injudiciously the ministers had behaved. The\r\nepisode might have been forgotten, the prestige of the government\r\nmight have recovered if a concession had been made to the virtuous\r\nindignation of those who were shocked by the \"scandal\" and of those\r\nwho persuaded themselves that they were shocked; no prime minister\r\nis strong enough to despise with impunity the suspicion that,\r\nbecause he cannot afford to lose them, or because he is indifferent\r\nto their offence, he is retaining colleagues for whose resignation\r\nhe should have asked. Too lofty of soul to regard the prejudices\r\nof the vulgar and perhaps reluctant to present Mr. Lloyd George to\r\nthe labour party or to the radical wing of the ministerialists, the\r\ngovernment listened only to the dictates of logic and loyalty: if\r\nthe three ministers were innocent of dishonest purpose or practice,\r\nthey must not be persecuted; indiscretion was not a hanging\r\noffence. The Master of Elibank soon afterwards abandoned political\r\nlife to take up, as Lord Murray of Elibank, a responsible position\r\nwith a firm of contractors; Sir Rufus Isaacs left the House of\r\nCommons to become lord chief justice; Mr. Lloyd George remained\r\nguardian of the public purse; and the less punctilious governments\r\nof the world from Mexico to France warmed to a feeling of cordial\r\nfellowship with methods which they seemed to recognise and with men\r\nwhom they seemed to understand.\r\n\r\nThis obedience to the findings of the commission was strictly\r\nlogical; and in refusing to be swayed by ignorant prejudice the\r\nprime minister gave one more instance of his unfailing loyalty\r\nto colleagues who, it cannot be said too often, were innocent of\r\nall dishonesty. Nevertheless, in the mouths of weaker men there\r\nlingered an unpleasant taste; and, if no one was seriously\r\nsurprised or hurt by the conduct of the principals, even the most\r\ncynical member of parliament was offended by the unprotesting\r\ntolerance of such men as Mr. Asquith and Sir Edward Grey, of whom\r\na more inflexible standard was expected. It was felt that, when a\r\nspeculating chancellor of the exchequer continued in office, it\r\nmust be because his chief was insensible to the undesirability of\r\nsuch practises, or because he was too sensible of his lieutenant's\r\nvalue as a vote-catcher; it was regretfully surmised that the prime\r\nminister would throw a protecting mantle over his colleagues,\r\nwhatever they did, and that his colleagues could do what they liked\r\nbecause the head of the government would never call for their\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nThe sense that the prime minister would only stir himself to use\r\nhis authority in a crisis encouraged a spirit of lawlessness which\r\nin the years following led to active disorder and the threat of\r\ncivil war; secure in the belief that they were too valuable to\r\nbe dismissed and free from fear that the head of the government\r\nwould call them to order, his less temperate colleagues were\r\nstimulated to a license of speech and to an independence of action\r\nthat threatened the solidity of cabinet rule and prepared the rift\r\nwhich ultimately broke the party. These were the days when the\r\nblood of Marlborough, warming in Mr. Winston Churchill's veins,\r\nurged him to take personal part in a military campaign against\r\na couple of hooligans in the east end of London; they were the\r\ndays of Mr. Lloyd George's more finished Limehouse manner. And,\r\nwhile it is fair to assume that the prime minister's intellectual\r\nfastidiousness recoiled from this exuberance of action and speech,\r\nhe did nothing to dissociate himself from it publicly.\r\n\r\nThe same lethargy brooded over the beginning of every new crisis.\r\nIn addition to a long succession of labour troubles, occasionally\r\ncomposed at the eleventh hour, but usually flourishing to the\r\ngeneral discomfort of the community at the thirteenth, ministers,\r\nin their lofty refusal to be stampeded, allowed two incipient\r\nrebellions against public order to reach a point of success and\r\ndetermination at which one could put a pistol to the head of the\r\ngovernment and the other could demonstrate that the executive\r\nlacked power to quell unruliness. During these years the agitation\r\nin favour of female suffrage is only of interest in so far as\r\nit encouraged the enemies of England in their belief that the\r\nstrength of the government was paralysed. The parliamentary vote\r\nhas now been conceded to women; Mr. Asquith, its most stalwart\r\nantagonist, has seen that he mistook a prejudice for a principle\r\nand has repaired his mistake. In the three years before the war,\r\nhowever, he was not yet so well convinced of women's fitness to\r\ngovern that he would allow female suffrage to become a line of\r\nparty division. The suffragettes spoke and stormed, burnt and\r\nbroke; their adherents in the House of Commons were not numerous\r\nenough to force a bill through; and the government was amply\r\njustified in not lending support to a cause which had no certain\r\npopular backing in the country.[19] But, if the time was not yet\r\nripe for a parliamentary contest, the executive had at least a duty\r\nin maintaining public order. The weakness displayed by ministers\r\nin handling this series of sporadic rebellions suggested to other\r\ndiscontented parties in England, Ireland and Germany that ministers\r\nwere powerless to govern; a critic with any detachment wondered, in\r\nspite of himself, why the English fancied that they had any genius\r\nfor self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSalvation by violence, never a healthy doctrine to inculcate, was\r\npeculiarly dangerous teaching for a section of the Irish who had\r\nbeen told for almost thirty years that they would be justified in\r\noffering forcible resistance to any attempt on the part of the\r\nimperial parliament to press home rule upon them. When ministers\r\nhonoured their obligation to the nationalist party by whose votes\r\nthey had been kept in office since 1910, the Orangemen announced\r\nthat they would resist by force. Cynics in England may have been\r\namused, seekers after truth outside England must have been shocked\r\nto find the Irish \"loyalists\"[20] threatening armed resistance to\r\nan act which could only come into force on the authority of the\r\nking of Great Britain and Ireland and of the imperial parliament;\r\nif not shocked, even the avowed anarchist must have been surprised\r\nto find the experiment in constructive treason blessed and headed\r\nby the Right Honourable Sir Edward Carson, K.C., M.P., one time\r\na law-officer of the crown and a man committed by his privy\r\ncouncillor's oath to loyalty towards his soveran. But these were\r\nrestless and unbalanced times, in which constitutionalism came to\r\nbe regarded as an outworn shibboleth: the bitter struggle over the\r\n1909 budget, the two general elections within a single year and\r\nthe more bitter struggle over the parliament bill had familiarized\r\nthe people of Great Britain with a new violence of language,\r\nof boast and of threat. The Ulster covenant and the Ulster\r\nvolunteers, appealing to the twin boyish love--in such men as Mr.\r\nF. E. Smith, K.C., M.P.--of a secret society and of playing at\r\nsoldiers, afforded a new thrill to jaded spirits who were perhaps\r\ndisappointed that, though the parliament bill had passed, no blood\r\nhad flowed under Westminster Bridge.\r\n\r\nBehind Sir Edward Carson stood a young Englishman in a hurry and a\r\nCanadian, no longer young, who had been entrusted with the delicate\r\ntask of teaching the conservative party a newer and better style\r\nof parliamentary opposition than Mr. Balfour had been able to\r\ninculcate; the Irish problem united the three indissolubly, and for\r\npresent violence and later responsibility there is little to choose\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\"I could contribute,\" said Mr. F. E. Smith on 18.6.12, \"very little\r\nto the military efficiency of those who were resisting the Regular\r\nForces or the still more formidable invasion from the South,\r\n_but_....\"\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine,\" said Mr. Bonar Law, on 27.7.12, \"no length of\r\nresistance to which Ulster will go which I shall not be ready to\r\nsupport.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will shortly challenge the Government,\" said Sir Edward Carson\r\non the same day. \"They may tell us if they like that this is\r\ntreason. We are prepared to take the consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not care tuppence whether it is treason or not,\" proclaimed\r\nSir Edward Carson on 21.9.12.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing,\" Mr. F. E. Smith suggested on 25.9.12, \"the Government\r\ngave such an order, the consequences can only be described in the\r\nwords of Mr. Bonar Law, when he said, 'if they did so it would not\r\nbe a matter of argument, but the population of London would lynch\r\nyou on the lamp-posts.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The Attorney-General,\" boasted Sir Edward Carson, himself an old\r\nsolicitor-general and a future attorney-general, on 11.10.12, \"says\r\nthat my doctrines and the course I am taking lead to anarchy. Does\r\nhe not think I know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you attempt to enforce this Bill ...,\" threatened Mr. Bonar Law\r\non 1.1.13, \"I shall assist them in resisting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will set up a Government,\" announced Sir Edward Carson on\r\n7.9.13. \"I am told it will be illegal. Of course it will. Drilling\r\nis illegal ... the Government dare not interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ulster will do well to resist, and we will support her in her\r\nresistance to the end,\" promised Mr. Bonar Law on 28.11.13.\r\n\r\n\"The red blood will flow,\" prophesied Sir Edward Carson on 17.1.14.\r\n\r\n\"To coerce Ulster ... no right to ask army to undertake,\" decided\r\nMr. Bonar Law. \"Any officer who refuses is only doing his duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day I shall like best,\" said Sir Edward Carson on 20.6.14,\r\nless than six weeks before the beginning of war with Germany, \"is\r\nthe day upon which I am compelled, if I am compelled, to tell my\r\nmen, 'You must mobilize.'\"\r\n\r\n\"If the occasion arises,\" Mr. Bonar Law undertook on 28.9.14, eight\r\nweeks after war had broken out, \"we shall support you to the last\r\nin any steps which Sir Edward Carson and your leaders think it\r\nnecessary for you to take.\"[21]\r\n\r\nWhile the leader of the unionist party, a former solicitor-general\r\nand the rising hope of the spent and broken tories were restrained\r\nfrom using language that could be borrowed by malcontents less\r\nhighly placed, their followers imposed less check on the unaffected\r\npoetry of their natures.\r\n\r\n\"There is a spirit spreading abroad,\" declared Captain Craig\r\n(_Morning Post_, 9.1.11[22]), \"which I can testify to from my\r\npersonal knowledge that Germany and the German Emperor would be\r\npreferred to the rule of John Redmond, Patrick Ford and the Molly\r\nMaguires.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they were put out of the Union ...,\" proclaimed Major F.\r\nCrawford, a Larne gun-runner, on 29.4.12, \"he would infinitely\r\nprefer to change his allegiance right over to the Emperor of\r\nGermany or any one else who had got a proper and stable government.\"\r\n\r\nAnd even Mr. Bonar Law ventured to state, even in the House of\r\nCommons, on 1.1.13:\r\n\r\n\"It is a fact which I do not think any one who knows anything about\r\nIreland will deny, that these people in the North-East of Ireland,\r\nfrom old prejudices perhaps more than from anything else, from the\r\nwhole of their past history, would prefer, I believe, to accept the\r\ngovernment of a foreign country rather than submit to be governed\r\nby hon. gentlemen below the gangway.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may not be known to the rank and file of Unionists,\" announced\r\n_The Irish Churchman_ on 14.11.13, \"that we have the offer of aid\r\nfrom a powerful continental monarch who, if Home Rule is forced on\r\nthe Protestants of Ireland, is prepared to send an army sufficient\r\nto release England of any further trouble in Ireland by attaching\r\nit to his dominion, believing, as he does, that if our king breaks\r\nhis coronation oath by signing the Home Rule Bill he will, by so\r\ndoing, have forfeited his claim to rule Ireland. And should our\r\nking sign the Home Rule Bill, the Protestants of Ireland will\r\nwelcome this continental deliverer as their forefathers, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, did once before.\"\r\n\r\nSince the consequences of their menace have been observed in\r\nthe desolation of a hundred million homes throughout the world,\r\nOrangemen have not dwelt with pride on this aspect of their\r\ncampaign; and, even at the time when the last threat was uttered,\r\nthe more temperate souls felt that the controversy was being\r\npushed beyond the limit of fair government-baiting. Weapons of an\r\nolder type were brought into play: Ulstermen, who of all dour,\r\nindependent races can best look after themselves, were depicted as\r\nthe future spiritual and financial victims of \"Rome rule\"; and of\r\nthe plea that Ulster only wished to remain a part of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland much was made by controversialists who would not\r\nconsent to be governed for a day, had the tables been turned, by an\r\ninsignificant minority of Ulster nationalists, backed by political\r\nsympathizers in another country.\r\n\r\nWith the thunder of opposing oratory mingled the rattle of\r\ngrounding arms and the tramp of marching feet; but, though the\r\nOrangemen warned the government that the Ulster rebels were too\r\nmuch in earnest to be disregarded, ministers were by now grown\r\nindifferent to the bluff of their enemies, the counsel of the\r\ndisinterested and the public insults which highly-placed ladies\r\nshowered upon them with impunity at court and in private houses.\r\nWhether the anarchy and treason, preached and admitted by Sir\r\nEdward Carson, would ever have flamed into civil war is a matter of\r\nguess-work. The nationalist leaders, rightly or wrongly, thought\r\nthat it would not; the prime minister who afterwards discounted\r\nthe strength of nationalist idealism from August, 1914, until the\r\nEaster rising was unlikely to give its true value, whatever that\r\nmight be, to the strength of unionist idealism two years before;\r\nby now, moreover, he was too well used to actual crises to be\r\nalarmed by a crisis which had not yet arisen. Mr. Birrell, the\r\nchief secretary, was too busily engaged in concealing his defects\r\nas an administrator under his brilliance as an epigrammatist to\r\nsupply the imagination that his leader lacked. No attempt was made\r\nto scotch the rebellion or bring the ringleaders to book; enrolment\r\nincreased, drilling continued, arms were purchased and imported. In\r\nthe spring of 1914 some uneasiness made itself felt in the bosom of\r\nColonel Seely, the secretary of state for war, and a confidential\r\nquestion directed to the loyalty of the troops stationed at the\r\nCurragh elicited that a number of officers, holding the king's\r\ncommission, would refuse to obey orders if commanded to proceed\r\nagainst the Ulster rebels.\r\n\r\nThough it was still a matter of guess-work whether the Orangemen\r\nwould rise, no one could doubt that, in the event of a rising,\r\nthere would be difficulty in making the army obey its orders. No\r\nless a person than the leader of the opposition had said that the\r\nofficer who refused would only be doing his duty. For a few hours\r\nthe House of Commons tried heatedly to assert itself against this\r\nattempt to establish a military ascendancy over parliament; the\r\ntail wagged and came near to lashing the dog; but the creation of\r\na crisis created with it an opportunity for the prime minister\r\nto shew his adroitness in overcoming crises; Colonel Seely\r\nresigned, and Mr. Asquith undertook the administration of the War\r\nOffice, thereby surprising the Curragh and the House of Commons\r\nso completely that the revolts in both places flickered out. The\r\ngovernment, however, had only escaped from one difficulty by\r\nplunging into a greater; ministers, at last realising that Ulster\r\nmust be coerced or conciliated and that Sir Edward Carson, relying\r\non his volunteers, was pressing them harder than Mr. Redmond, who\r\ncould only rely on a government's honour, decided to conciliate.\r\nIt was announced that the home rule scheme must be amended; a\r\nconference was summoned; the Orangemen were comforted by a promise\r\nthat the home rule act would not be enforced without an amending\r\nact; and ministers committed themselves to a formula which has\r\nbecome an accession-oath to succeeding administrations: Ulster must\r\nnot be coerced. To a liberal, the idea of coercion is so hateful\r\nthat he welcomes any declaration which undertakes to circumscribe\r\nits tyranny; if it has to be applied, he would sooner see one man\r\nin bonds and three at large than one at large and three in bonds;\r\nbut the liberal loathing of oppression, as expressed by Mr. Asquith\r\nand Mr. Lloyd George, seems to have been confined to onehalf of one\r\nprovince of Ireland. To the tortured and distracted other three\r\nprovinces their process of thought has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIn the venerable story of an international gathering which was set\r\nto write an essay on the elephant, it will be remembered that,\r\nwhile the Englishman wrote on \"Elephant-Hunting\" and the Frenchman\r\non \"The Love-Affairs of the Elephant\", it was a German who evolved\r\nan elephant out of his inner consciousness and a Pole who devoted\r\nhimself to \"The Elephant in Relation to the Polish Question.\" For\r\na subject-nation to be obsessed by concern for its nationality is\r\nperhaps tiresome to others; not to be so obsessed is despicable;\r\nand the Irishman and the Pole have at least escaped the degradation\r\nof a deracialised Jew. None the less, though nationality be the\r\nfirst, it is not the only concern; and even an Irishman may have\r\nfelt, during these years, that Irish independence was being\r\npurchased at the cost of a liberalism that was not confined by\r\nnational bounds. Political science has changed so little in two\r\nthousand years that, whatever the origin of the state, it now\r\nexists primarily, as it existed in the days of Aristotle, to\r\nmake life possible: the personal safety of the individual must\r\nbe assured and he must be guaranteed the essentials of living.\r\nOn this foundation there rises now, as in the days of Aristotle,\r\nthe second law, which alone separates an assembly of men from a\r\npack of wolves, that the state exists to make possible a life of\r\nexcellence; the individual must be afforded a chance of living a\r\nnobler life. Despite sporadic crime and external war, the first\r\ncondition of safety was satisfied in England; and, though death by\r\nstarvation was not unknown, the existence of work-houses testified\r\nthat none need starve. Because the second condition is still so far\r\nfrom being fulfilled and because the chance of living a noble life\r\nis confined to an infinitesimal handful of the population, a party\r\npledged to social reform came into existence and will justify its\r\nexistence so long as oppression or fear of oppression, injustice,\r\ninsecurity, disease, ignorance, poverty and squalor remain to\r\nbe removed. It was the business of liberalism to remove these\r\nhandicaps.\r\n\r\nHow far did it succeed? The violence of political controversy\r\nin those days hid from most observers how little was being done\r\nto improve the lot of man, woman or child in England. After the\r\npassion for reversing the legislation of their predecessors had\r\nrun its course, ministers did indeed carry a courageous measure of\r\nold-age pensions; their insurance act was generous in intention\r\neven if it was unneeded and ineffectual in practise; and the\r\nparliament act created a procedure for expediting social reform in\r\nthe future. But how much else did they find time to achieve in the\r\nintervals of the constitutional crisis and of the unending clash\r\nover Ireland?\r\n\r\nWhile they wrangled, the possibility of a noble life was brought\r\nno nearer. Hundreds of thousands were insufficiently fed, ill-clad\r\nand verminous, with insufficient air, light and warmth; millions\r\nwere corrupt with phthisis, cancer or venereal disease. On these\r\nphysical wrecks and starvelings education left little mark; and a\r\ncentury of labour combination and industrial legislation had not\r\nlaid that spectre of unemployment which stunts the soul and turns\r\ncold the heart of even the healthiest and most independent when\r\nthey live within sight of the margin of subsistence. Day after day\r\nthe opportunity of noble living was withdrawn from the thousands\r\nof women who through moral weakness, poverty, indolence or greed\r\nwere pressed as recruits to prostitution; it was withdrawn from the\r\nhomes that were ruined by drink and gambling. The shadow cast by\r\nthe cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces of modern civilisation\r\nwas so dense that there still existed in England, in the twentieth\r\ncentury, private societies to preserve animals and children from\r\nbeing tortured.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a sudden attack was made on the trade in\r\nhuman bodies and souls known by timid English euphemism as \"the\r\nwhite-slave traffic\"; the criminal law was amended and made more\r\nvigorous; the defencelessness of children was recognised and\r\nsafeguarded. For what they were worth, let all credit be given to\r\nthese gingerly attempts to heal unsightly sores, provided that no\r\none mistake part cure for complete prevention. A prison flogging\r\nmay deter the pander from dealing in human flesh, but it does not\r\ndispose him to noble living for its own sake; this is begotten of\r\na sense of beauty by education. During these years a cartoon by\r\nMax Beerbohm depicted Lord Lansdowne trying, with all the amenity\r\nof his kind, to understand just what Mr. H. G. Wells meant by the\r\nbarrenness of official politics; the successive education bills\r\nof the liberal administration sacrificed the elementals of good\r\ncitizenship to an ingenious game of protecting church of England\r\nchildren from the perils of religious instruction in the tenets of\r\ndissent; and whether in after life a man starved his children or\r\nlived on the hire of his wife's body mattered less than that for\r\nthe first twelve years of existence a unitarian should be secured\r\nfrom believing or even understanding that God was Three-in-One and\r\nOne-in-Three.\r\n\r\nWhile only those who are equally ignorant of politics and of\r\nhistory imagine that the party system can be ended without a change\r\nin all the practises of English representative government, it is\r\nunquestionable that the sometimes artificial antagonism of two\r\nparties set eternally in opposition to each other causes undue\r\nimportance to be attached to politics on their tactical side; the\r\ncontent is sacrificed to the form. If man's hope of noble living\r\nwent unstrengthened in the years from 1906 to 1914, this was\r\nbecause the trustees of the nation were too busy squabbling for\r\npossession of the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThroughout July, 1914, all parties were working industriously\r\nto amend the home rule bill in such a way as to compensate the\r\n\"ascendancy\" party for the loss of its ascendancy. That solution\r\nhad not been discovered when war broke out. To present a united\r\nfront in face of the enemy, Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Bonar Law\r\npatriotically promised the prime minister their support in this\r\nlatest crisis; the prime minister, not to be outdone in patriotism,\r\nundertook to postpone controversial legislation for the duration\r\nof the war. The contentious bills were left to hibernate in the\r\nstatute-book; the constitutionalists in Ireland were left to\r\ncompare the failure of constitutionalism with the success of\r\ntreason; and the political historian observed that, once more, the\r\nmajor crisis had saved the government from the consequences of the\r\nminor.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, as controversial legislation was only postponed, so the\r\nconsequences of this surrender to rebellion were only postponed;\r\nmore unhappily still, they were not postponed for so long. Certain\r\nlessons were learned in the years from 1911 to 1914; and they have\r\nnot been forgotten.\r\n\r\nFirst, the government, as the suffragettes and Orangemen had\r\nshewn, could be bullied; it either would not or could not keep\r\norder. And for more than two years it was bullied by strikers,\r\nconscriptionists, \"war groups\", newspaper proprietors and those\r\nwho wished for a coalition; it was bullied in open session and in\r\nsecret session by private members, ex-ministers and commissions of\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\nSecondly, officers of the British army could refuse to obey orders\r\nif commanded to suppress a political agitation with which they\r\nmight sympathise; it was not made clear by the army council that\r\nprivates had the same freedom if commanded to suppress a labour\r\nagitation with which they might sympathise.\r\n\r\nThirdly, a privy councillor might, with impunity, preach armed\r\nresistance to a law, though the result of his preaching were local\r\nbloodshed or a general war; Sir Roger Casement might not practice\r\narmed resistance in protest against the suspension of that law.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the word of a British minister could no longer be\r\naccepted. A political bargain is as binding as any other; and since\r\n1910 the government had depended on nationalist support of which\r\nthe price was the home rule bill. When pressure was applied, the\r\ngovernment refused to honour its bargain; payment was to be made\r\non new conditions and in debased coinage. It is instructive to\r\nread the list of those who acquiesced in this surrender, for the\r\ndishonour of the prime minister was shared by all of his colleagues\r\nand supporters who consented to the act of betrayal: they are\r\nEnglish, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, Jewish and hybrid, so that the\r\ndisgrace is not confined to a single nationality; they are men who\r\nprobably pay their tradesmen, certainly their opponents at bridge.\r\nAnd many of them made eloquent speeches of righteous indignation\r\nwhen the Imperial German government abrogated the Belgian and\r\nLuxemburg treaties. In Ireland to this day and for many years to\r\ncome there is not a man, woman or child who will take the British\r\ngovernment seriously. For defence it is urged that, if the home\r\nrule act had been enforced in 1914, there would have been civil\r\nwar in Ulster; temporary peace was bought at the price of civil\r\nwar throughout the rest of Ireland from the Easter rising onwards,\r\nas the rest of Ireland learned from British ministers and from\r\nSir Edward Carson that \"the great questions of the time are to\r\nbe decided not by speeches and votes of majorities but by blood\r\nand iron.\" Faced with this choice of evils, it was unfortunate\r\nthat ministers selected the alternative which carried with it the\r\nrepudiation of their own bond.\r\n\r\nAs the unconstructive critic is no less irritating and no more\r\nhelpful than a howling child, the Irish policy of the liberal\r\ngovernment may only be attacked by those who are prepared to\r\nsuggest an alternative. The present first essential is that the\r\nimperial parliament should reestablish in Ireland a belief in\r\nits own good-faith; the second, that, as nationalist history has\r\nadvanced rapidly since 1914, the Irish should be given a measure\r\nof independence relatively as great as that promised to them in\r\nthe third home rule act; the third, that they should determine its\r\nform for themselves. All Ireland should be divided into electoral\r\nareas to choose a constituent assembly which would contain Ulster\r\nProtestants, Ulster Catholics, Southern Protestants, Southern\r\nCatholics and Sinn Feiners (who can enter no conference so long\r\nas there is a price on their heads). When a two-thirds majority\r\nof this constituent assembly has agreed upon a constitution, the\r\nimperial parliament should undertake to enforce it, if necessary by\r\narms, whatever its form and without favour for any recalcitrants;\r\nand every section of parliament should pledge itself, jointly and\r\nseverally, to this. The minds of those who are disturbed by talk\r\nof an Irish republic may be soothed if the word \"commonwealth,\"\r\nsufficiently honoured in other parts of the world, be substituted.\r\nThose who see in Ireland a base of attack on England in a future\r\nwar are not entitled to be heard until they have stated (1) what\r\nwar they anticipate; (2) where Ireland is to find the money to\r\nbuild a fleet or to equip an army, and (3) how, in any war, Ireland\r\nis more immune from the supervision of the British navy than are\r\nFrance, Belgium and Holland.\r\n\r\nUntil Ireland has been pacified, the reciprocal murdering and\r\nincendiarism of this new Thirty Years' War will continue, at\r\nthe lowest, to hinder succeeding governments in their task of\r\nreconstruction after the war, as the unsettled Irish problem\r\nhindered the task of social amelioration which had been entrusted\r\nto the liberal government in 1906. Month by month, as the shadow\r\nof Ireland advanced farther into British politics, the authority\r\nand usefulness of a great reforming party receded; and, at the\r\nend, the bruised, the broken-hearted and the disillusionised\r\nagreed that, if the liberal ministry which the genius of Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman had contrived and which the biggest liberal\r\nmajority in history supported so long and faithfully could have\r\nbeen caught up to heaven on the morrow of the parliament act, every\r\nliberal would have said: \"_Felix opportunitate mortis_.\"\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war marked the death of liberalism. Freedom of\r\nspeech was curtailed and suppressed until one scrupulous patriot\r\nasked in the House of Commons whether the Sermon on the Mount\r\nshould not be regarded as subversive of military discipline;\r\nfreedom of action was drowned by a wave of collective hysteria\r\nin which governors and governed vied with one another to impose\r\nnew burdens and to bend submissive and welcoming necks to receive\r\nthem. The theory of representative government, shaken to its\r\nfoundations when a House of Commons which had been elected to\r\ncarry the parliament bill engaged--as a parergon--in a European\r\nwar, was finally destroyed when conscription was imposed without\r\nelection or referendum. The lusty growth of autocracy soon choked\r\nsuch sickly flowers of liberalism as a care for the rights of\r\nminorities and a concern for the pleadings of conscience; though\r\na moment's reflection would have shewn that, if Christianity is\r\npersistently thrust down the throats of all English children, a few\r\nwill almost certainly accept it literally, those who looked for\r\nno qualifications to the injunction that a man must not kill were\r\nquickly taught that Christianity was not a practicable creed for\r\ntimes of war; and a country which prided itself on a traditional\r\nlove of fair play first reviled and then persecuted conscientious\r\nobjectors with so little discrimination that, when one Quaker\r\nwho had acted as a stretcher-bearer received the Mons medal, he\r\ncould only wear it in the prison to which he had been confined for\r\nrefusing to undertake military service.\r\n\r\nWhenever, in the first two years of the war, an article of liberal\r\nfaith came in conflict with the heterogeneous policy of a coalition\r\ngovernment, the article of faith was thrust aside. The resolutions\r\nof the Paris economic conference committed Great Britain to a\r\ntariff war with her enemies; the treaty of London converted a\r\nwar which had been undertaken to satisfy British obligations to\r\nBelgium into an imperialist war in which the present and future\r\nallies of Great Britain were invited to help themselves at the\r\nexpense of their neighbours; gradually there was heard less talk\r\nof a crusade on behalf of small nationalities, and the liberal\r\nparty committed itself to a \"knock-out blow\". So committed, it\r\ncould neither utter nor listen to proposals which involved less\r\nthan unconditional surrender; and, though Belgian neutrality might\r\nperhaps have been vindicated and reparation secured before the war\r\nhad run half its ultimate course, the imperialist policy in which\r\nliberalism acquiesced allowed of no check to hostilities until\r\nEurope was exhausted and revolution had been unloosed in Russia, to\r\nspread no man knows whither. The peace party in English politics\r\nfinally assented to a settlement of which any militarist in France\r\nor Prussia would have been proud to acknowledge the authorship.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that any set of political principles\r\ncould remain unchanged by war, though liberalism would have been\r\nless violently mutilated if it had appealed to the heart rather\r\nthan to the head of liberal leaders. How far their foreign policy\r\ncontributed to the war which destroyed liberalism must be discussed\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON THE EVE\r\n\r\n _Τῶνδε δὲ ὄυτε πλούτον tis τις τὴν ἒτι ἀπόλαυσιν προτιμήσας\r\n ἐμαλακίσθη οῦτε πενίας ἐλπίδι, ὡς κᾶν ἒτι διαφογὼν αοτὴν\r\n πλουτήσειεν, ἀναβολὴν τοῦ δεινοῦ ἐποιήσατο.

At home, the Kiel Canal had been\r\nreconstructed and the western strategic railways completed; abroad,\r\nRussia, with her slow, cumbrous mobilisation, could be left out of\r\naccount for three weeks; and three weeks was thought sufficient\r\nto crumple up an army which the French, true till death to their\r\npolicy of giving everything to their country but the money in\r\ntheir pockets, had neglected to equip. Politically, too, France was\r\ndistracted by one of her periodical Caillaux scandals.\r\n\r\nThere remained Great Britain; and, if the French were uncertain\r\nof armed support until the first units of the expeditionary force\r\nlanded, the German general staff may be excused for thinking that\r\nthe expeditionary force would never embark. For months it was\r\nbelieved at the German Embassy in London that England was faced\r\nwith volcanic labour disturbances; Sir Edward Carson and Lady\r\nLondonderry on one side, Mr. Asquith and Mr. Birrell on the other\r\nhad brought Ireland to the brink of civil war; and a government\r\nwhich could not restrain unruly women from breaking windows and\r\nburning churches was not an efficient machine for waging a war\r\nin which the last ounce of ability and determination would tip\r\nthe balance. Never, since the day when the triple _entente_ first\r\nloomed in the delirium of German statecraft as an aggressive\r\nencircling movement in diplomacy, had it seemed flimsier and more\r\nvulnerable to the first shock of the \"inevitable\" war.\r\n\r\nThis, as will be seen later, is not to hold the German government\r\nsolely responsible for the war nor to admit that war was\r\ninevitable. The ancestral voices of the Chauvinists who in 1914\r\ntook most credit for their prescience in prophesying war might have\r\nbeen stilled by the reflection that from the Fashoda incident to\r\nthe Lansdowne _entente_ they had predicted a no less inevitable\r\nwar with France, as, a generation earlier, they had predicted one\r\nwith Russia; the good-will, moreover, which Great Britain for\r\nhalf-a-dozen years before the war extended to Russia and France had\r\nits exact counterpart in the former good-will which obtained when\r\nLord Salisbury presented Heligoland to Germany and when, earlier,\r\nEnglish sympathy was on the side of Prussia in the war of 1870.\r\nNo war is inevitable until it breaks out, if then; and successful\r\ndiplomacy in effect and in intention is the history of inevitable\r\nwars which have never taken place.\r\n\r\nBy 1914, as indeed in 1911, the blundering of four Foreign Offices\r\nhad produced a state of tension in which war was very difficult\r\nto avoid; but the phrase-fed population which repeated in solemn\r\ntones that Germany had \"been preparing for this war for forty\r\nyears\" seemed never to enquire why the war had not been fought by\r\ninstalments (as, all were told, Germany would assuredly do if Great\r\nBritain did not play her part in 1914) and why the first attack had\r\nnot been launched in 1905 when Russia was exhausted by her struggle\r\nwith Japan in Manchuria and distracted at home by revolution and\r\nexperiments in constitution-making. So she might have rid herself\r\nfor many years of the Russian menace; and, if France had been drawn\r\nin, it is inconceivable that so early as 1906 Great Britain would\r\nhave been drawn in too. The reconstruction of the Kiel Canal was\r\ntherefore unimportant; and, for an occasion of war, nothing less\r\nflimsy than the assassination of an archduke was ever necessary.\r\nAnd archdukes were plentiful. That Germany did not provoke a\r\nconflict in 1905 suggests that she had not in fact devoted forty\r\nyears to preparing for a world-war and, further, that in that\r\nyear she did not regard a war of any kind as inevitable. By 1914\r\nher view of world-politics had swung round; and, if other nations\r\ncontributed to bring war nearer, Germany must bear full and sole\r\nresponsibility for provoking it.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened between 1905 and 1914 to bring about this change\r\nof heart? Now that the war is at last over and truth is no longer\r\ndisguised or concealed for the purposes of propaganda, now too\r\nthat every nation of the world is wondering what benefit any one\r\nhas secured by nearly five years of unequalled sacrifice and\r\nsuffering, it is interesting to examine why this war should have\r\nbeen considered inevitable. It is more than interesting, it is\r\nvital; for the horrors of war are being forgotten even by those\r\nwho suffered most from them, and, in a few years' time, another\r\ngovernment of men who are themselves over military age may see,\r\nwith one eye, the \"necessity\" of war and, with the other, its\r\nromance or glory, as, before 1914, the youth and age of England\r\nalike saw chiefly the \"romance\" of the Napoleonic wars without\r\nremembering the brutality of the press-gang, the nightmare\r\ntortures of field surgery unaided by anæsthetics and antiseptics,\r\nthe calculated atrocities of the Peninsular campaign and the\r\nunromantic, hideous reality of killing and maiming at all times.\r\nIf the war was inevitable, someone should surely have benefited by\r\nit materially. Belgium, a pawn on the board of inevitability, has\r\nbeen dragged from the conflict of the great powers and restored\r\nfor a few years at least to the number of small nations; and all\r\nwho went to the succour of Belgium may feel that they risked the\r\nworld to gain their own souls. Nevertheless, if Belgian neutrality\r\nwas indeed but the occasion of a war which the great powers could\r\nno longer avoid and if no one of them is richer, stronger, safer,\r\nhealthier or happier, it would have been better not to undertake\r\nit; and, before any have time to forget, all should take steps to\r\nmake other wars impossible.\r\n\r\nYet not even this boon has been secured. Since 1914 mankind has\r\ngained the creed of the league of nations, which is reverently\r\nmumbled with as much conviction as would be exhibited by a\r\nwell-bred agnostic who found himself shepherded to church and\r\ndiscovered his neighbours mumbling the apostles' creed. The league\r\nof nations has been accepted with the blithe vagueness of a man\r\nwho proclaims that he \"believes in progress and all that sort of\r\nthing.\" M. Clemenceau accepted it, with the reservation that it\r\nmust not remove the foot of France from the neck of her adversary;\r\nPresident Wilson accepted it, with the reservation that he could\r\nnot bring pressure to bear on Congress if Congress refused to take\r\na hand in policing the world; Mr. Lloyd George accepted it, with\r\nthe reservation that the work of the league was to be entrusted\r\nindefinitely to the supreme council of the allies.\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish to disparage a machine which is being\r\ndeliberately kept from functioning by a number of men too\r\nsuspicious or too lustful of power to give the fly-wheel its\r\npreliminary spin: if that international duelling which men call\r\nwar is to be stamped out as, a hundred years ago, duelling between\r\nindividuals was stamped out in England, every nation must make a\r\nvast preliminary sacrifice by surrendering the right of private\r\nvengeance and aggression, as the individual perforce surrendered\r\nhis private right to punish an enemy or to protect his own\r\nhonour at the sword-point; there must no more be reservations in\r\narbitration between states than there are reservations to the\r\nEnglish law under which aggressor and aggrieved submit their case,\r\neven where it involve their fortune and honour, to the judgement\r\nof an impartial court. Want of courage or of honesty has kept\r\nmost champions of the league[23] from admitting, still more from\r\ninsisting on, this repugnant idea of sacrifice; the league remains\r\nan abstraction; and already there is talk of an \"inevitable\" war\r\nbetween the United States and Japan, \"inevitable\" rivalry in\r\nship-building between Great Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\nMuch is to be hoped from sane historical education; but, whatever\r\ncontribution the League of Nations may make to the peace of the\r\nworld, the first preparatory lesson, which no one as yet should\r\nhave had time to forget, is that every modern war is a complex\r\nwhich includes \"men disembowelled by guns five miles away\" and\r\nthat a war between several of the great powers, conducted with\r\nmodern methods of destruction, is one in which no one, probably,\r\ngains anything. The second lesson is that, as the late war struck\r\nat combatants and noncombatants, neutrals and belligerents\r\nimpartially if not with the same force, involving German women\r\nand children in the starving grip of the allied blockade and\r\nspattering the walls of English coast-towns with the brains and\r\nblood of British women and children slaughtered in some naval\r\nbombardment or air-raid, so any future war, with its call for the\r\nlast resources of the nation, will convert into belligerents and\r\npotential victims the old men who are left to till the fields and\r\nthe boys who stand at a lathe, the girls who fill a shell-case\r\nand the mothers who suckle future soldiers: all are providing the\r\nsinews of war; and the sinews of war have to be cut without too\r\nnice concern for age or sex. The third lesson is that there is no\r\ninherent, life-and-death antagonism between a Stettin dock-hand\r\nand a Bristol dock-hand, between a London physician and a Berlin\r\nphysician, between Professor Gilbert Murray and Professor von\r\nWillamowitz-Moellendorff. So, at least, one school would be\r\ninclined to assert; and, if the assertion hold truth, it was no\r\nless true in 1914. Why, then, was this unnecessary war, which has\r\nimpoverished the world in everything but bravery and suffering,\r\nconsidered necessary?\r\n\r\nThere was much ill intention, it may be submitted; more ignorance;\r\nand bad faith most of all. Russia and Germany stood, like every\r\nautocracy, to gain by a successful blood-bath; the triumph of\r\na \"spirited foreign policy\" deflected attention from domestic\r\npolitics and strengthened the bonds of discipline. France nurtured\r\na spirit of hatred and revenge against the power which had after\r\nmany years curtailed her privilege of exploiting and disturbing the\r\nGerman states for her own profit; she hankered, also, to recover\r\ntwo provinces which had been torn from her side as ruthlessly\r\nas she had torn them from the side of another. So much for ill\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nThere was ignorance in the epidemic of international fear which\r\narose and spread from the day in 1892 when Germany made overtures\r\nof friendship to Great Britain. Before the government of the day\r\nhad time to promulgate its historic doctrine of insularity, France\r\nwas overtaken by panic at the possibility of being encircled; to\r\ncounter an Anglo-German alliance which never came to birth, she\r\npurchased the alliance of Russia by financing the trans-Siberian\r\nrailway and acquired at second-hand an interest in the thieves'\r\nkitchen of south-east Europe and a responsibility for its\r\nperiodical conflagration. It was now Germany's turn to suspect an\r\nencircling movement directed at her immense double frontier; the\r\nuneasy suspicion turned to active alarm when the pacific geniality\r\nof King Edward and the cautious diplomacy of Lord Lansdowne added\r\nthe resources of the world's greatest naval power to those of the\r\nworld's most numerous and of Europe's most scientific armies.\r\n\r\nIn such an atmosphere of suspicion, the \"race of armaments\"\r\nprogressed apace and was fostered by an economic hallucination\r\nthat, if Great Britain or Germany could destroy the other's trade,\r\nthe survivor would be roughly twice as rich--with the embarrassing\r\nrichness of a seller who brings his goods to a market where no\r\none has anything to offer him in exchange. In brief sun-bursts\r\nof sanity, the manipulators of British foreign policy sickened\r\nof the suspicion-disease which themselves had spread; there were\r\n\"peace talks\" and peace missions: Mr. Churchill proposed a naval\r\nholiday; Lord Haldane visited Germany, flitting between Potsdam and\r\nWindsor, from one soveran to another, with a pregnant gravity and\r\nconsequence that would have turned the head of a man less prone\r\nto personal vanity. By this time, unfortunately, the suspicion\r\nwas too deep-seated to be charmed away by the bilingual fluency\r\nof a philosophic chancellor; the offer of a naval holiday, by a\r\npower which was already predominant at sea, suggested some kind of\r\nconfidence trick; and the German government not only believed that\r\nan attack was impending, but knew well that, if the parts had been\r\nreversed, a boat-load of German Churchills and Haldanes would have\r\nbeen sent with messages of good-will to England. And no one outside\r\nthe ranks of labour had proclaimed the simple doctrine that the\r\nNürnberg toy-maker had no inherent, life-and-death quarrel with the\r\ntoy-maker of Birmingham. So much for ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn England at least there was also bad faith.\r\n\r\nA new chapter in British foreign policy began with the Anglo-French\r\n_entente_: designed originally to end a long period of friction in\r\nNorth Africa, it effectually ended the longer period of British\r\nisolation from continental politics. So successful was its work as\r\nan instrument of peace that a similar _entente_ was established\r\nwith Russia; and, as soon as London and Paris had disposed of North\r\nAfrica, London and Petersburg turned their attention to unsettled\r\nproblems in Persia. It was speciously claimed that the _entente_\r\nprinciple reduced the menace of war: henceforth all international\r\ndifferences could be accommodated by friendly chats between the\r\nforeign ministers of _entente_ powers; if Germany would join the\r\nhappy family, the menace of war would vanish.\r\n\r\nThose who sincerely hoped to see growing from the first _entente_an\r\ninformal United States of Europe revealed one blind spot in their\r\nimagination. The object of war, seen from one angle, is to upset\r\nthe existing order in the interests of one belligerent; the object\r\nof the _entente_ was to preserve the existing order; but, though\r\nthis brought substantial advantage to Great Britain, France and\r\nRussia by putting North Africa and Persia out of bounds for\r\ndiplomatic skirmishing, it brought no corresponding advantage to\r\na country which joined the _entente_ after the spoils had been\r\ndivided. \"You have helped yourselves,\" the German imperialist\r\nmight fairly say; \"you not only refuse to let me participate,\r\nbut you wish me to guarantee you in permanent possession.\" The\r\nGerman government refused to recognise the right of three nations\r\nto distribute among themselves the unallocated territories of the\r\nworld; it presumed, further, to doubt their power; and the Agadir\r\nepisode was an experiment to test the strength of the _entente_. A\r\nmailed fist and shining armour had prevailed against Russia when\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina were annexed; they were worth trying again.\r\n\r\nThe international crisis of 1911 proved that, _on this occasion\r\nand on this subject_, Great Britain and France were not to be\r\nintimidated; here, at least, the _entente_ was impregnable.\r\nWould it always be as solid? Throughout Europe, after 1911, the\r\ndominating question in foreign politics was whether the diplomacy\r\nof Great Britain and of France could always count on the armed\r\nbacking of the other. Was there an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance? In the absence of an alliance, was there a binding\r\nobligation on either power to come to the assistance of the other?\r\n\r\nThe question was asked in the House of Commons:\r\n\r\n\"There is a very general belief,\" said Lord Hugh Cecil, on March\r\n10th, 1913, \"that this country is under an obligation, not a treaty\r\nobligation, but an obligation arising owing to an assurance given\r\nby the Ministry, in the course of diplomatic negotiations, to send\r\na very large armed force out of this country to operate in Europe.\r\nThat is the general belief.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Asquith replied:\r\n\r\n\"I ought to say that is not true.\"\r\n\r\nA fortnight later he amplified his assurance by stating that\r\nthis country was not under any obligation, not public and known\r\nto parliament, which compelled it to take part in any war. In\r\nother words, if war arose between European powers, there were no\r\nunpublished agreements, which would restrict or hamper the freedom\r\nof the government, or of parliament, to decide whether or not Great\r\nBritain should participate in a war. The use that would be made of\r\nthe naval and military forces, if the government and parliament\r\ndecided to take part in any war was, for obvious reasons, not a\r\nmatter about which public statements could be made.\r\n\r\nIf the House of Commons had received any assurance less\r\nunequivocal, it is more than possible that the ministerial party\r\nwould have split and that the government would have fallen.\r\nThough heavily reduced in numbers, the liberal majority was\r\nidentical in spirit with that which had been returned to support\r\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman; it was strongly radical, straitly\r\nnonconformist and essentially pacific, knowing little of history\r\nand nothing of foreign policy, neither understanding nor liking\r\ncontinental adventures and occasionally resisting vehemently a\r\nquarter-comprehended drifting which demonstrably absorbed in\r\narmaments a revenue which might have been devoted to social reform.\r\nIt disliked Mr. Churchill's activities at the Admiralty, it\r\ndistrusted the liberal-imperialist elements which had risen to the\r\ntop of the cabinet in the persons of Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward Grey\r\nand Lord Haldane; it had no quarrel with any one and, if its fears\r\nhad not been lulled by the prime minister's explicit assurances,\r\nit would have taken steps to dissipate that danger of a European\r\nwar in which Great Britain began to be involved on the day when\r\nshe involved herself in continental politics. If the \"obligation\r\nof honour,\" disclosed in 1914, had been made public any time in\r\nthe three years preceding, if the government had fallen, if the\r\ncommons of Great Britain had shewn themselves to the pacific\r\nminorities and majorities in every country of Europe as backing\r\ntheir peace-talk with deeds, there would have been reality in the\r\nprofessions of the foreign secretary; the naval holiday and Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman's hopes for proportional disarmament might\r\nhave had a hearing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there would have been no war.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no obligation to participate, there was no cause for\r\nuneasiness. It was not until August Bank Holiday, 1914, that the\r\nHouse of Commons and the country discovered that \"no obligation\"\r\nwas the same as \"an obligation of honour.\" Sir Edward Grey, in\r\nguiding the House to war, used the words:\r\n\r\n\"For many years we have had a long-standing friendship with France\r\n... how far that friendship entails ... an obligation, let every\r\nman look into his own heart, and his own feelings, and construe the\r\nextent of the obligation for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no \"obligation,\" as stated by Mr. Asquith; there was\r\n\"a debt of honour,\" as implied by Sir Edward Grey. \"I ought to\r\nsay that is not true,\" Mr. Asquith had replied in reference to\r\nan alleged \"assurance given by the Ministry, in the course of\r\ndiplomatic negotiations, to send a very large armed force out of\r\nthis country to operate in Europe\"; yet, to judge from another\r\npassage in Sir Edward Grey's same speech, there was so much\r\ntelepathic harmony between the naval staffs of Great Britain and\r\nFrance that the French fleet had already withdrawn to protect\r\ntheir joint trade routes in the Mediterranean and was leaving\r\nthe northern and western coast of France to the hypothetical\r\nprotection of the British navy. An Irishman, unversed in the\r\nniceties of parliamentary good faith, has to pause for thought.\r\nBishop Thirlwall, when challenged to say whether he did not\r\nprefer compulsory religion to no religion at all, is reported\r\nto have confessed that the difference was too subtile for his\r\ncomprehension; any one of sensitive conscience must confess that\r\nhis comprehension is not subtile enough to detect any other\r\ndifference between an \"obligation\" and a \"debt of honour\" than that\r\nthe debt of honour, unbacked by such sanction as is purchasable by\r\na sixpenny contract-stamp, is the more strongly binding. Because\r\nthere had been no exchange of signed notes, it is arguable that Mr.\r\nAsquith was justified by legal training and usage in denying that\r\nan obligation existed; Sir Edward Grey appealed to the chivalry of\r\nthe House of Commons and defied it to say that there existed no\r\nobligation of honour.\r\n\r\nChivalry was stronger than resentment; the pacific majority, which,\r\nin its innocence of legalism, had kept the government in power on\r\nthe assurance that no continental commitments existed, voted the\r\ncountry into war on the assurance that its honour was involved.\r\nIt only remains to put on record the impression left by this hazy\r\nobligation on the mind of one party to it:\r\n\r\n\"We had a compact with France,\" said Mr. Lloyd George in August,\r\n1918, \"that, if she were wantonly attacked, the United Kingdom\r\nwould go to her support.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to an objection he added:\r\n\r\n\"There was no compact as to what force we should bring into the\r\narena. In any discussion that ever took place, either in this\r\ncountry or outside, there was no idea that we should ever be able\r\nto supply a greater force than six divisions.\"\r\n\r\nLater still he borrowed the qualifying language of predecessors\r\nwho had tried to keep faith with France and Great Britain at the\r\nsame time:\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said, \"the word 'compact' was too strong for use in\r\nthat connection. In my judgement it was an obligation of honour....\"\r\n\r\nSo much for bad faith. The people of England, apart from occasional\r\npanics and blood-lusts, are justified in claiming that they did not\r\nwant war; misled--and it is hard to refrain from adding \"wilfully\r\nmisled\"--by their rulers, they were given no chance of preserving\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe public, which was left to pay the bill, is unlikely to know for\r\nmany years how many members of the government shared with the prime\r\nminister and the foreign secretary the responsibility of misleading\r\nthe House of Commons and the country. It is fair to assume that the\r\nterms of this compact, which was not an obligation, but only a debt\r\nof honour, were divulged to Lord Haldane before he carried out his\r\npeace mission to Potsdam; and to so consistent a champion of peace,\r\nof retrenchment on armaments and of social reform as Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, before he lectured Germany in his Mansion House speech\r\nduring the Agadir crisis of 1911; and to Mr. Churchill, before he\r\nchanged in a night from a \"little-navy\" man to a \"big-navy\" man;\r\nand to any one else who, like Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Churchill,\r\nforced the cabinet door to see what manner of skeleton lay behind.\r\nIt is equally fair to assume that the smaller fry of the ministry\r\nwere not admitted to the guilty secret; nothing but ignorance could\r\njustify so egregious a speech as that in which one member informed\r\nthe public that \"he could conceive no circumstance in which\r\ncontinental operations would not be a crime against the people of\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Agadir to Armageddon, those who believed in the word of\r\nthe government believed also that nothing in the international\r\nposition of those days could involve Great Britain in a continental\r\nwar. Sir Edward Grey's adroitness and love of peace had steered\r\nEurope through a Moroccan crisis and two Balkan wars; when Austria\r\nhurled her bullying ultimatum at Servia, it was hoped that his\r\nintervention would again be successful and that, whatever the\r\nforeign ministers might achieve, the world would not commit suicide\r\nin revenge for the assassination of an Austrian archduke.\r\n\r\nNo one troubled; no one, surely, had reason to trouble. London in\r\n1914 was an exaggerated caricature of London in 1913 or 1912. The\r\ncarnival moved with the inconsequent speed and false recklessness\r\nof a _revue_. Of the thousands who besieged every railway-station\r\non the last Friday of July, bound for all parts of England and for\r\nevery kind of holiday, few can have fancied that it was their last\r\nholiday in a world at peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAn average group, assembling at Paddington, found the train\r\nservice disorganised by a minor strike and whiled away its time\r\nof idleness enforced by exchanging news of the Buckingham Palace\r\nconference and of the menace to peace in south-eastern Europe.\r\nOne of the party had been lunching with the Pilgrims and retailed\r\na rumour that there had been a slight run on the Bank of England\r\nthat morning; this was in the early days of rumours, and all\r\nlistened respectfully, though it was difficult to see why English\r\ndepositors should be alarmed at the Balkan imbroglio. Another of\r\nthe party enlivened the journey by exhibiting new maps of Servia\r\nand south-east Austria, but, once away from the neurosis of London,\r\nno one was interested in anything but the threatened civil war in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nAny one who asked perfunctorily for news of Servia was assured that\r\nshe would yield to superior force at the last moment. Though a\r\njournalist might whisper confidentially that the fleet had sailed\r\nfrom Portsmouth with coal stacked on deck, this was very far from\r\nmaking war unavoidable: if Servia refused to comply with the terms\r\nof the ultimatum, Russia would indeed come to her protection\r\nagainst Austria; but then Germany would come to the aid of Austria\r\nagainst Russia, while France would hasten to help Russia against\r\nGermany. The same automatic widening of the conflict had been\r\nthreatened when Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina; but, as it\r\nwas then recognised that one great power would bring in another, so\r\nit would be recognised now and prevented; as Great Britain could\r\nnot face a European war for Bosnia, so she could not now face it\r\nfor Servia.\r\n\r\nSimilar conversations were taking place at that hour in thousands\r\nof similar houses. Few of all who took part in these last meetings\r\nimagined that within a few days they would be training for\r\ncommissions; no one dreamed that, before a year had passed, almost\r\nevery man at all these tables would have entered the army, that\r\nsome would be wounded, others already killed. To most, a general\r\nwar only became conceivable two days later, when the Sunday\r\nnewspapers reported that German troops had crossed the frontiers of\r\nFrance and Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThereafter, more quickly than dazed minds could take in, the\r\nimpossible became the actual. On Monday, though Kuhlmann's\r\nefforts to localise the conflict brought a moment's hope, letters\r\nand telegrams, flying from one part of the country to another,\r\nconvinced even the most sanguine that war--in which Great Britain\r\nwould be involved--was inevitable; and, before nightfall, every\r\ntown and village was ringing with Sir Edward Grey's speech.\r\n\r\n\"How far that friendship entails ... an obligation, let every man\r\nlook into his own heart, and his own feelings, and construe the\r\nextent of the obligation for himself....\"\r\n\r\nThe thousands who had scattered four days earlier to every part of\r\nEngland poured back, on a common impulse, to London. There, all\r\nfelt, they would gain readier news, perhaps better news, when the\r\nsilence and isolation of the country had become unbearable. They\r\nassembled at hundreds of country stations, debating to the last\r\nwhether the peace-trained navy would stand the test of war; and,\r\nas they read the morning papers, they found that the full text of\r\nthe foreign secretary's speech made war a certainty, unless Germany\r\nsubmitted to a diplomatic rebuff more disastrously humiliating than\r\nthe worst defeat in the field.\r\n\r\nLondon that afternoon lay at the mercy of the first war-expositors.\r\nThose who had most vehemently attacked the 1909 ship-building\r\nprogramme now most loudly thanked God that England was an island\r\nprotected by a strong fleet; a few railed against the earlier\r\ncourse of a foreign policy which had embroiled Great Britain\r\nin continental rivalries; no one at that time or in that place\r\nsuggested that war could be averted. When the major issues had been\r\ndiscussed, confidences were exchanged about the ministers who\r\nhad resigned and wobbled and withdrawn their resignations. Lord\r\nMorley and Mr. John Burns had left the cabinet, followed by a small\r\nnumber of minor office-holders; Lord Beauchamp and others, who had\r\nrefused to support a war for which the sanction of the country had\r\nbeen neither obtained nor sought, renewed their allegiance to the\r\ngovernment when the neutrality of Belgium, which Great Britain\r\nwas bound by treaty to defend, was violated; but the champions of\r\npeace, who had vowed that British troops should only leave England\r\nover their dead bodies, and the opponents of intervention, who had\r\nexplained to wavering colleagues that Great Britain was under no\r\ninternational obligation to take part, remained snugly if silently\r\nin office. The fleet, it was now heard, had been ordered to take\r\nup war-stations and to seal the German forces in port before\r\nthe ultimatum was issued; the expeditionary force, it was also\r\nheard, had received at least preliminary mobilization-orders while\r\nwar hung yet in the balance; and so quickly do moral standards\r\ndecline when personal security is threatened that those who had\r\nattacked Germany for her too timely massing of troops congratulated\r\nthemselves that in England also there were men of laudable\r\nvigilance and decision.\r\n\r\nAnd, like punctuation-marks at the end of every sentence, came\r\ninterruptions from men torn out of familiar surroundings and flung\r\ninto a world whose very language they did not understand:\r\n\r\n\"They say there will be a run on the banks for gold ...,\" murmured\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"They say the Government will have to declare a moratorium ...,\"\r\nmurmured another.\r\n\r\n\"They say there will very likely be bread riots....\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that special constables are to be enrolled....\"\r\n\r\n\"They say you ought to lay in a certain amount of food....\"\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock at night a state of war began between Great\r\nBritain and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when the ultimatum took effect until the day when\r\nthe first reports of military activity reached England, political\r\nspeculation and prophecy raged unconfined. In the betting-book of\r\none club stands recorded a wager that, in the event of war, there\r\nwill within ten years be not one crowned head in Europe. Now that\r\nwar had come, every one was calculating how long it could go on:\r\nfor all her preparation, it was said, Germany would soon run short\r\nof certain essentials; but a decision must be reached quickly,\r\nas banking experts were already predicting a general collapse of\r\ncredit in November. Memories of the Franco-German war suggested\r\nthat, with the precision of modern weapons and with the size of\r\nmodern armies, no nation in the world could support the strain for\r\nmore than a few weeks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whether peace were signed within three months or six,\r\nthe old national and international conditions under which the men\r\nof military age had grown up were destroyed for ever: most of them,\r\nthough even now they did not realise it, would be killed or maimed;\r\na long war would bleed the world slowly to death, a short war would\r\nbe followed by such frenzied re-arming and re-equipment as would\r\nexhaust every country not less surely. The days of general luxury,\r\nperhaps even of common comfort, were over; taxation would close the\r\ngreat houses and disperse the old retinues. Ethically, politically,\r\nintellectually, economically and socially every war marked a\r\ntransition from one epoch to another; and, before the first unit\r\nof the expeditionary force had landed in France, every one felt\r\ndimly that an era had closed. As yet there had been no call for\r\nmore men, as yet none knew whether there was time to train them,\r\nas yet it seemed likely that the casualties would be confined to\r\nthe professional soldiers of the regular army and to the volunteers\r\nof the territorial forces; but, though imagination refused to\r\ncontemplate such an upheaval as took place within even one month,\r\nthe men between twenty and thirty felt that their world had passed\r\naway. Before five years had run their course, the best of them had\r\npassed away, too; and of one generation the finest work in the most\r\nfruitful period of construction was lost for ever.\r\n\r\nThis was a time of meditation and heart-searching. So staggering\r\nwas the shock of war that men's minds refused to conceive of it as\r\nthe human punishment of human malevolence or folly: Fleet Street\r\ndragged in Armageddon and laid the responsibility on God, while\r\nfinding an excuse for Him in the depravity of man. The moral\r\nlaxities of France and the perversions of Germany were to be\r\npunished by a retribution not less overwhelming than that which\r\nhad fallen upon Sodom and Gomorrah; as Belgium, Russia and England\r\nwere included in the general destruction, it was explained that\r\nthey were being punished, respectively, for the Congo atrocities,\r\nthe Jewish massacres and the attempted disestablishment of the\r\nWelsh church; only Servia, which suffered first and longest, and\r\nJapan, which was far enough away to be forgotten, were overlooked\r\nby those who set themselves to justify the ways of God to man. It\r\nwould take too long to trace the workings of providence in so many\r\ncountries, but of England at least it may be claimed that there\r\nwas a disproportion between her offence and her punishment: at the\r\nworst her people were indolent, vulgar, selfish and lacking in\r\nan imaginative conscience, but a nation would not seem ripe for\r\ndestruction when four or five million of its members voluntarily\r\noffer themselves for mutilation and death.\r\n\r\nMeditation passed away with the first bewilderment and was\r\ndiscouraged with every forward step of a nation arming itself for\r\ndefence. From time to time spirits dwelling in isolation struggled\r\nto preserve detachment, the young poets who lay out under the\r\nstars in momentary expectation of death raised their voices in\r\nchallenge to incomprehensibility; but the first were arrested as\r\nsedition-mongers and the second were dismissed as poets. Meditation\r\nwas not allowed to become articulate until the armistice. It\r\nwere fruitless and ungracious to dwell on the epidemic delusions\r\nand organised fury of those first days: they are common to every\r\ncountry in every war;[24] though they broke out periodically,\r\ntheir grotesque violence abated as new work called for undivided\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nNot for long did it seem that the casualties would be confined\r\nto the regular army and the expeditionary force. Officers of the\r\nspecial reserve received their mobilisation-orders and reported\r\nfor duty on the south coast; after long and anxious silence, during\r\nwhich it could only be assumed that they had crossed the channel\r\nand were being hurried into Belgium, some of the survivors at\r\nlength wrote that they had been in the great advance and the great\r\nretreat, that they had lost almost every part of their kit, but\r\nwere enjoying a moment's breathing-time. After the Marne, they\r\nmoved up again, \"dodging death and danger, without rest or food\r\nor drink ... till death seemed relaxation and a wound a luxury.\"\r\nAlthough for more than four years hardly a day passed without\r\nbringing news of the death, disablement or loss of some relation or\r\nfriend, for the men under thirty the casualties crowded thickest\r\nin the early weeks; their generation was the most plenteously\r\nrepresented in the first months; and, after four years, of their\r\ngeneration fewest remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FRINGE OF WAR\r\n\r\n \" ... In a few hours at most, as they well knew, perhaps a tenth\r\n of them would have looked their last on the sun, and be a part\r\n of foreign earth or dumb things that the tides push. Many of\r\n them would have disappeared for ever from the knowledge of man,\r\n blotted from the book of life none would know how--by a fall or\r\n chance shot in the darkness, in the blast of a shell, or alone,\r\n like a hurt beast, in some scrub or gully, far from comrades and\r\n the English speech and the English singing. And perhaps a third\r\n of them would be mangled, blinded or broken, lamed, made imbecile\r\n or disfigured, with the colour and the taste of life taken from\r\n them, so that they would never more move with comrades nor exult\r\n in the sun. And those not taken thus would be under the ground,\r\n sweating in the trench, carrying sandbags up the sap, dodging\r\n death and danger, without rest or food or drink ... till death\r\n seemed relaxation and a wound a luxury. But as they moved out\r\n these things were but the end they asked, the reward they had come\r\n for, the unseen cross upon the breast. All that they felt was a\r\n gladness of exultation that their young courage was to be used.\r\n They went like kings in a pageant to the imminent death. As they\r\n passed from moorings to the man-of-war anchorage on their way to\r\n the sea, their feeling that they had done with life and were going\r\n out to something new welled up in those battalions; they cheered\r\n and cheered till the harbour rang with cheering. As each ship\r\n crammed with soldiers drew near the battleships, the men swung\r\n their caps and cheered again, and the sailors answered, and the\r\n noise of cheering swelled, and the men in the ships not yet moving\r\n joined in, and the men ashore, till all the life in the harbour\r\n was giving thanks that it could go to death rejoicing. All was\r\n beautiful in the gladness of men about to die, but the most moving\r\n thing was the greatness of their generous hearts....\"\r\n\r\n                                       JOHN MASEFIELD: _Gallipoli_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\"For various reasons,\" wrote William Glynne Charles Gladstone to\r\nGeneral Sir Henry MacKinnon,[25] \"I feel the time has come when I\r\nought to enlist in His Majesty's Army. Heaven knows, so far from\r\nhaving the least inclination for military service, I dread it and\r\ndislike it intensely; consistently with that I have no natural\r\naptitude for it, and what is more, no training of any sort. I have\r\nnever done a single minute's military training in my whole life,\r\nI am a rank although not a very robust civilian; even my love of\r\nshooting has somehow never led to my learning to shoot with a\r\nrifle. I recall all that to your mind because I want to put it to\r\nyou that under these circumstances there is only one thing for\r\nme to do, and that is to begin at the beginning and enlist as a\r\nprivate. I am not prepared to face the possibility, however remote,\r\nof being put in some post of responsibility without knowing the\r\nropes very well and from the beginning.... I have decided not to\r\nenlist in any force which is confined to home defence, but one\r\nwhich in its turn will be called upon to go to the front.\"\r\n\r\nHad William Gladstone been elected spokesman of the men under\r\nthirty, he could not have expressed their collective and individual\r\nattitude to the war in apter terms than those which described his\r\nown mingled sense of diffidence and duty. All who had loved and\r\nfollowed him at Eton, at Oxford and at Westminster shared his\r\nhatred for a war which arrested human progress and destroyed human\r\nlife, as they shared his ignorance of warfare and his dread of\r\nassuming inexpert responsibility for the lives of other men; all,\r\nor at least all who mattered, living or dead, offered themselves,\r\nno less resolutely than he did, in the first hours of war for any\r\npurpose to which the government might put them. The rank civilians\r\nwho were even less robust than he was laid siege to the doors of\r\nany organisation that would make use of them and, with no more\r\ntraining in their whole life than he had of military training,\r\nenlisted as substitutes in place of those who were accepted for\r\nthe army. Before the government, with its counsel of \"business as\r\nusual,\" attempted to set going again the arrested pulse of the\r\nnational life, those who had time, energy or aptitude, how little\r\nso ever, to place at the service of the community were already\r\nabsorbed in new work or awaiting a call to fresh duties.\r\n\r\nSheer inability to sit idle, no less than patriotism, urged them\r\nto drive cars and ambulances, to raise funds and equip hospitals,\r\nto take the places of their own clerks or gardeners and to toil at\r\nthe routine of a public office. Dependent on censored newspapers,\r\njejune letters and ill-informed gossip, England was an uneasy home\r\nin the unfamiliar days when the whole world was first seething\r\nwith war. To men past middle-age the news-bills recalled the names\r\nof places which they had forgotten since the time, forty-four\r\nyears earlier, when another German army was pouring into France;\r\nwould this onrush, all wondered, be as irresistible? Morning after\r\nmorning the converging black lines of the German advance raced\r\ndown the map, ever nearer to Paris; one Sunday the notorious\r\n\"Amiens despatch\" prepared its readers for the news that the\r\nentire expeditionary force had been encircled. Men, more men and\r\nyet more men were the crying need; the order had gone forth and\r\nvolunteers were to be enrolled by the hundred thousand; but, until\r\nthey could be trained to an equality with the professional soldiers\r\nof Germany, a veritable human breakwater was required to prevent\r\nFrance from being submerged.\r\n\r\nIt is small wonder--the wish being parent to the thought--that\r\nsome accepted unhesitatingly from excited neighbours that twenty,\r\nfifty, a hundred thousand Russians, secretly embarked at Arkangel\r\nand disembarked at Aberdeen, were passing as secretly through\r\nEngland to a southern port; letters from Scotland told of cars\r\ncommandeered to divide the stream between the east-coast route\r\nand the west; the amateur strategist demonstrated with atlas and\r\nencyclopædia that Arkangel could be kept ice-free until September;\r\nand it was both pleasanter and easier to believe the man who\r\nclaimed to have spoken to the mysterious troops in Russian than to\r\nenquire what facilities existed for transporting a single brigade\r\nto the northern coast of Russia.[26]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in London and in the country, impromptu local\r\ncommittees of relief applied for unoccupied cottages and houses,\r\nfor furniture and bedding, for food and money to be distributed\r\namong the Belgians who had sought asylum in England; in those\r\ndays, though the Englishman and the Belgian never pretended to\r\nfeel personal cordiality towards each other, the decision of King\r\nAlbert to uphold the neutrality of his country was ungrudgingly\r\nvoted one of the bravest political acts in history; the brief\r\ndefence of Liége was at least long and unexpected enough to hold\r\nup the annihilating German advance for precious hours while the\r\nBritish expeditionary force effected its union with the French\r\narmy; nothing, in consequence, was too good for the victims of\r\nGerman treachery and of their own honour; and, until it became a\r\nlegitimate form of English humour to describe a Belgian refugee as\r\na Belgian atrocity, these dazed and ruined outcasts were received\r\nwith liberality and general kindness.\r\n\r\nFrom them and from the press England learned a little of the\r\nsavagery which had been let loose in Belgium and North France:\r\nmurders, single and wholesale; raping, private and public;\r\nmutilation worthy of a necrophile; burning and pillage. After\r\nsix years some memories may be dulled, the superior may affect\r\na toleration that they did not feel in those days; some of the\r\nstories were exaggerated, and before the end every belligerent\r\nhad perpetrated a certain number of atrocities. Nevertheless, the\r\noriginal charges were investigated by a commission working under\r\nthe chairmanship of Lord Bryce, who must be credited with some\r\nknowledge of the rules that govern historical and legal evidence;\r\nand, even if other armies followed a vile lead, it was the Germans\r\nwho set the example and enshrined \"frightfulness\" in their\r\nwar-book. There was no effective protest in Germany; and, though\r\nthe need for propaganda and apologetics has lessened, there has\r\nbeen no recantation, no hint of repentance nor sign of grace. It is\r\nnot surprising that, among those who remember, the name of a German\r\nstinks and the presence of a German is an outrage.\r\n\r\nUntil she appears bare-footed and draped in a sheet, Germany must\r\nremain branded with the mark of bestiality: though peace has been\r\nrestored, though trade has been resumed, there can be no good-will\r\nbetween humane, just-minded men and a barbarian nation which has\r\nnot repented of its misdeeds. It is not an excuse to say that\r\n\"frightfulness\" was imposed from above, for the humblest private\r\nhas an inalienable right to disobey such an order and to gain his\r\nsoul at the loss of his life; frightfulness, so far from being\r\nresisted, was applauded and spread by the women who mocked and\r\nspat in the faces of enemy prisoners. Never has a nation been more\r\nsolid; never has the collective responsibility been heavier. As it\r\nis at least conceivable that this will not prove to be the last\r\nwar, the present result of impenitence on the one side and of short\r\nmemory on the other is that, if ever there be another, it can be\r\nbegun in comfortable certainty that murder, rape, arson, pillage\r\nand mutilation go unpunished and are a form of warfare for which\r\nthere is an unchallenged precedent.\r\n\r\nThe civil and military population of Germany has not made even\r\na coward's show of repentance by choosing scape-goats for the\r\nburden of its sins; and repentance has not been forced upon it\r\nfrom without. In the general election of 1918, Mr. Lloyd George\r\npromised that the war criminals should be brought to trial; in 1921\r\nwe are still waiting to see them punished. Already the Kaiser has\r\none party claiming indulgence for him as the creature of his own\r\ngeneral staff, while another would leave him unpunished and even\r\nuntried for fear that apparent persecution might make a martyr of\r\nhim. But was not the Kaiser _Kriegsherr_? Is not the _Kriegsherr_\r\nresponsible for his own war-book? Is it not an offence against\r\nhumanity and even against the laws of nations to use a human screen\r\nwhen advancing through hostile country? On that count alone he\r\nshould be hanged.\r\n\r\nThe fear of making martyrs is based on the misunderstanding of a\r\nsingle historical example: Louis Napoleon fostered the Bonapartist\r\nlegend a quarter of a century after his uncle's death as a romantic\r\nappeal against the unromantic dreariness of the Orleanist rule; it\r\nis forgotten that the \"martyrdom\" of Napoleon I. bore no fruit\r\nuntil the French, with their paradoxical blended love of logic and\r\nsentiment, found themselves more than twenty years later under a\r\ngovernment which satisfied neither craving; it is forgotten that\r\nMarshal Ney, \"the bravest of the brave,\" was executed in a way\r\nwhich shewed that French chivalry was dead, yet no one called\r\nhim martyr. The former German emperor, ruling by right divine,\r\nstrutting and phrase-making by the affliction of congenital\r\ninsanity, may be excused as the Emperor of the Sahara was excused,\r\nor confined with his fellows in a criminal-lunatic asylum; if he\r\nassert his sanity, then his place is on a cart and his fate a\r\nnoosed rope. Yet one more party, its sentiment stirred by the sight\r\nof Count Hohenzollern chopping trees in a Dutch park, pleads that\r\nin his downfall he is paying longer and heavier penalty than that\r\nof instant and painless death; it may be suggested that inglorious\r\nexile is a blessing unexpected and undeserved of the degenerate who\r\nflitted across the frontier when the country that he had misruled\r\nwas in its death agony. The pantaloon of Europe gave up his\r\nmumming when the game grew dangerous; with it he gave up his last\r\nopportunity of ascending from the ridiculous to the sublime.\r\n\r\nWhere no imagination is required, the English are a kindly race\r\nwho find it easier and more congenial to forget than to inflict\r\npunishment even when it is deserved, even when the criminal\r\nunpunished becomes a model for future crime. Every murderer may\r\nbe sure of his petition for reprieve; in the excitement of the\r\npresent an Englishman will always forget the excitement of the\r\npast, even when this shortness of memory leaves a debt unpaid. The\r\nwar is so long over, its later stages were so different from the\r\nearlier that few now remember their obligation to Lord Kitchener\r\nin those first months. It is for soldiers and statesmen to decide\r\nwhether he outlived his own usefulness, whether he reduced the War\r\nOffice to chaos, even whether the new armies would not have been\r\nformed without the inspiration of his name; others may be grateful\r\nto an imagination and a courage that led him to warn the country\r\nthat he was preparing for a three years' war, when the country was\r\nwondering whether war on such a scale could possibly drag on after\r\nChristmas. Those who were then living on the remote fringe of the\r\nwar may recall the indefinable sense of security which was brought\r\nby the news that he had been appointed secretary of state for war.\r\n\r\nMore quickly forgotten than anything else in these days was the\r\nnation's debt of gratitude to Lord Haldane for reorganising the\r\narmy and for preparing, in the expeditionary force, the finest\r\nfighting weapon in recorded history. His admiration for Germany,\r\nhis visits to the Kaiser and his study of German methods led a\r\npeople which prided itself on its dogged common-sense to charge\r\nhim with treacherous German sympathies; political opponents,\r\neager enough before the party truce to discredit the ministry by\r\ndestroying one of its most prominent members, encouraged the belief\r\nthat Lord Haldane, while in temporary charge of the war office,\r\nhad obstructed the mobilisation of the expeditionary force; and\r\nthe man who had made the new model army was credited with designs\r\non the country which it saved. When once it is recognised that the\r\nEnglish, in their present credulity and ignorance, are unfit for\r\nself-government, these aberrations become easily intelligible;\r\nit is not so easy to understand or to justify the action of Lord\r\nHaldane's colleagues who, for all their worthless moral support\r\nand for all their entreaties that he should remain in the cabinet,\r\nallowed him to be sacrificed to popular clamour without raising a\r\nvoice or stirring a finger to protect him publicly.[27]\r\n\r\nThese early impressions are perhaps the deeper for that there was\r\nso little in those early days, before each man had taken up his\r\nnew work, to disturb a course of general reflection. When the\r\nmorning and evening papers had been read, there was nothing to do\r\nbut to brood over this spectacle of a world gone mad. Everywhere\r\nin England there was the same chatter and speculation, the same\r\nspy-rumours and epidemics of hoarding; the same competition in\r\nwar-economies and rivalry in war-services. Every day brought\r\nnews of new recruits to the army, the civil service and a score\r\nof services no less unexpected, until, at the end of September,\r\none who was equally without training or aptitude for teaching\r\nreturned to Westminster with cap and gown, to become a temporary\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere would be a smaller public-school literature if the privilege\r\nof describing or criticising public schools were restricted to\r\nthose who had seen them from both the form-room and the common\r\nroom.[28] \"Ian Hay\" speaks somewhere of the schoolmaster's life\r\nas being the worst paid and the most richly rewarded; and, if no\r\nremuneration compensates the damage to nerves, temper and faith\r\nwhen a man tries simultaneously to maintain order, to excite\r\ninterest and to impart instruction to fifty or sixty boys of\r\nfourteen to seventeen, reward comes from contact with the minds\r\nof boys first stirring to wakefulness and with the characters of\r\nboys who, for all their mischief and resourcefulness of attack, are\r\nlovable in their ingenuousness, their humour, their chivalry, their\r\nconservatism, their strict and strictly-circumscribed honour.\r\n\r\nAnd, if faith is sometimes tried, faith in public-school education\r\nwas justified in the years from 1914 to 1918. If it be granted\r\nhypothetically that the war was won for England and, further, that\r\nit was won by soldiers in the field rather than by ministers,\r\nmunition-makers, bankers and military correspondents, it was won by\r\nthe leadership of the officers and by the fighting quality of the\r\nmen; and the leaders were supplied first to the old army and then\r\nto the new, for the first years of the war, almost wholly by the\r\npublic schools. When, at the end, the net was thrown more widely,\r\nthe quality of the officers deteriorated; though they lacked\r\nnothing of courage, they could furnish no substitute for something\r\nindefinable but recognisable--never so quickly recognised as by the\r\nmen they led--which only a public school provides.\r\n\r\nApart from its training in character, public-school education\r\nwas justified in that, if the aim of education be to teach a\r\nman how to learn, the versatility of the old public-schoolboy\r\nwas a rare tribute to his education; and versatility is not\r\nconfined to knowing the commercial or even the scientific jargon\r\nof half-a-dozen languages. Hardly a man was not in some degree\r\nuprooted; and all took to their new work and to their new\r\nresponsibilities as lightheartedly as they would to a new game.\r\nIt is in this sense that the British may fairly claim to be an\r\nimperial people: the empire, since the days of Warren Hastings\r\n(an Old Westminster), has been administered by public-school boys\r\nwith public-school methods and the public-school tradition of\r\nresponsibility; if the empire disintegrate, it will be because the\r\ntime has come for the administration to pass into native hands or\r\nbecause the work of the public schools abroad is stultified at\r\nhome. It was the public-schoolboy who officered the new armies, the\r\nnew civil service, the whole of a new nation organising itself for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThough outward forms change little in a school so old as\r\nWestminster, the war had brought a new spirit and a new vent for\r\nenthusiasm: all but a handful were in the uniform of the officers'\r\ntraining corps; most of the time out of school was given up to\r\nparades and drills, shooting-practise, lectures and instruction in\r\nmap-reading; and war was the one subject that competed with the\r\nnarrower interests of the school.\r\n\r\nNeither in 1914 nor ten years before the testing of war would an\r\nunbiased observer have suggested that English public schools were\r\nincapable of improvement; at both times, however, he might have\r\ninsisted that the improvement must come from the homes of the boys.\r\nIn effect, English parents try to get their sons, who are destined\r\nfor a controlling position in the life of the nation, educated\r\nfor half-a-dozen of their most critical years at a price which is\r\nless than they would pay for an equal time at a moderate hotel.\r\nThe emoluments of a schoolmaster, as of a soldier or a clergyman,\r\nwould tempt no one who had the assurance or the contrivance to\r\nsupport himself in commerce, in the civil service or at the bar;\r\nand for that reason a fellow of All Souls is not commonly found in\r\nthe army, on the staff of a school or in holy orders. The vaunted\r\nlong holidays give a schoolmaster the leisure to keep his mind\r\nfresh with travel; they do not supply the means. To marry on his\r\nsalary is to look forward to years of sordid economies, rewarded at\r\nlength by the grant of a house and of the right to make money as an\r\ninn-keeper.\r\n\r\nThe establishment fees like those for tuition and board are so\r\ninsufficient that most schools are hampered for want of money\r\nto build, to rebuild, to equip and to replenish; the sanitary\r\naccommodation is usually inadequate and sometimes scandalous. This\r\ncannot be remedied until parents are willing to pay more; and the\r\nmental attitude of many parents is one of irresponsible relief at\r\ngetting rid of their sons for three-quarters of the year and, with\r\nthem, of the educational and moral problems that they have artfully\r\nshelved until their sons reach school age. Between that which a\r\nparent expects a boy to learn at school and that which the school\r\nexpects him to have learned at home, many unnecessary lessons are\r\ntaught and many necessary lessons are left untaught.\r\n\r\nIf, in care and training, a boy were regarded as not less important\r\nthan a race-horse, the public schools would need to ask nothing\r\nmore. An adequate payment for the responsibility of education\r\nwould attract the best scholars in the country and would enable\r\nthem to retire in affluence after ten years' service and before\r\ntheir hearts were broken by routine. The schoolmaster could dictate\r\nto the parent not less than a trainer dictates to an owner, and\r\nin this way the gaps in public-school education might be filled;\r\nif music, French and German were taught abroad during the school\r\nholidays, if the rudiments of divinity and English had been\r\nimparted at home in the first twelve years of a boy's life, if the\r\nintellectual atmosphere in which a boy is brought up were less\r\nfog-infested, the foundations on which the schoolmaster has to\r\nbuild would be more secure.\r\n\r\nAmateur and professional schoolmasters, temporary and permanent\r\ncivil servants, with those who were over age or unfit for the\r\narmy, met to the number of many thousands in these days on one\r\nfield of war activity which deserves a few words of commemoration.\r\nTo relieve the regular police, already depleted, in their normal\r\nduties and to furnish an additional force to guard railway-bridges,\r\npower-stations and similar vital parts from enemy attack, the\r\ngovernment authorized the enrolment of special constables; for\r\nthose who were engaged by day, a separate unit with distinctive\r\nduties was established in the headquarters central detachment.\r\nDivided into sections manned from the clubs and government\r\noffices,[29] this detachment was entrusted with the task of\r\npatrolling the grounds of Buckingham Palace nightly from 9.0 until\r\n5.0; in addition, its members were required to report at Scotland\r\nHouse at every alarm of air-raid or riot and to hold themselves\r\nin readiness to be sent whithersoever required. Organised under a\r\ncommandant, inspectors, sub-inspectors and sergeants, arrayed in a\r\nuniform of its own, equipped with truncheons, whistles, brassards\r\nand torches and drilled--whenever it could be collected--in the\r\ngardens of the Temple, the headquarters detachment watched and\r\nwaited through four years.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the men was better than the use that was made of\r\nthem. It would be consoling to think that the mere existence\r\nof such a force discouraged enemy agents from their work of\r\ndestruction; certainly moral influence was seldom backed by a\r\nsuccessful trial of strength; and, when the truncheons were\r\nsurrendered, very few had been drawn and fewer still blooded. Once\r\nor twice, when German shops were being looted, the headquarters\r\ndetachment was sent to Limehouse or Shoreditch, there as a rule\r\nto be mewed up in reserve at the local police-station while the\r\nnecessary work was done by the ordinary constables; once or twice\r\na cordon would be made round a shattered building or a fallen\r\naeroplane; but for the most part the detachment sat in Scotland\r\nHouse from the summons until the dismissal or patrolled Buckingham\r\nPalace gardens through the night, waiting for a conflict which\r\nnever took place. Before the end, each constable must have sat\r\nin the guardroom for one or two hundred hours and patrolled the\r\ngrounds for one or two thousand miles; the biscuits and tobacco\r\nthat he consumed are to be reckoned by scores of pounds, the coffee\r\nthat he drank by tens of gallons; and, though some at least had\r\nseen the sun rise more often in the summers before the war, none\r\never fancied that he could see it with such weariness and loathing.\r\nFor men who were already overworked by day, the additional fatigue\r\nwas mistaken patriotism; and many dropped out before the armistice.\r\nIf, however, few members of the detachment can look back on their\r\nservice with much sense of pleasure or profit, some can at least\r\nhold themselves indebted for new friendships.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe speed with which men threw themselves into unfamiliar work\r\nduring the war was only equalled by the speed with which they were\r\ntransferred from one kind of unfamiliar work to another; and to a\r\nman who had as little knowledge of administration as of teaching\r\nthere was nothing surprising in the lightning conversion of an\r\namateur schoolmaster into an amateur civil servant.[30]\r\n\r\nOne serious gap in the history of the war remains to be filled by\r\na comprehensive account of the origin and growth of the temporary\r\ndepartments. Their number is to be reckoned by the score, their\r\nstrength by scores of thousands; in function they ranged from\r\nencouraging thrift and translating enemy newspapers to ordering\r\nheavy artillery, commandeering ships and controlling the supply,\r\ndistribution and price of food. Some were vast expansions of a\r\nsub-department in Foreign Office, Admiralty, Board of Trade or War\r\nOffice, others--like those of Food and Shipping--were created by a\r\nminister out of a museum or hotel, a private telephone-exchange,\r\na code of instructions, a supply of official stationery and an\r\nassortment of male and female clerks; some were set to function by\r\nan old civil servant borrowed from another office or resuscitated\r\nfrom retirement, others evolved their system by imitation or by the\r\nlight of nature. If in five years there was a heavy bill to pay\r\nfor overlapping and waste, for errors of judgement and blunders\r\nin execution, for interdepartmental warfare and magnification of\r\nprivate bishoprics, any one who saw the temporary civil service\r\nfrom the inside may feel that it was yet light in relation to\r\nthe multiplicity of interests involved and to the amount of work\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIn its genesis and development, the Trade Clearing House of the\r\nWar Trade Department[31] was typical of most temporary offices.\r\nOn the outbreak of hostilities, the National Service League found\r\nitself with premises, furniture, a staff and a number of at least\r\ntemporarily obsolete functions. For a time a special censorship\r\nwas established in connection with the Admiralty; one recruiting\r\nofficer scoured the clubs of London, another the colleges of Oxford\r\nuntil a big and varied personnel had been collected; when more\r\nhands were required, each of the original members would recruit\r\na friend, for whom he could vouch. As the work of the department\r\nwas concerned with every kind of export trade, no one was admitted\r\nwho could turn to private account any knowledge that came to him\r\nin his official capacity; and, though military service was not yet\r\ncompulsory nor departmental exemption the desire of the gun-shy,\r\nthe recruiting for the office was almost entirely confined to men\r\nwho were over age or unfit.\r\n\r\nThe \"department\" had at first no official status; and, when a\r\nreport of its activities in censorship reached the home secretary,\r\nhe suggested that it should regularise itself if it wished to\r\nescape heavy penalties for interfering with his majesty's mails.\r\nAt this time the Customs were thrown into difficulty and confusion\r\nby the proclamation of the king in council, forbidding all trade\r\nwith the enemy: in the absence of records, investigation and an\r\nintelligence department, it was impossible to say whether goods\r\ncleared from London would ultimately reach enemy destination; and\r\nthe censors who were watching the cable and wireless operations\r\nof Dutch and Scandinavian importers seemed the natural advisers\r\nto approach. At this point the embryonic department, which had\r\nrisen from the ashes of the National Service League, joined with\r\na licensing delegation from the Customs to form the War Trade\r\nDepartment and Trade Clearing House.\r\n\r\nThe formal executive authority lay with the Privy Council, but the\r\ndepartment was a joint administrative and advisory body, receiving\r\nand transmitting information between War Office, Admiralty, Foreign\r\nOffice, Home Office, Scotland Yard, the new Censorships and,\r\nindeed, any other department that would give or accept information\r\ndesigned to strengthen the blockade, to check espionage at home and\r\nthe transmission of information abroad and to prevent trade with\r\nthe enemy. As the work became organised and the records increased,\r\nthere arose further duties of editing, compiling, summarising and\r\ntranslating, too numerous and technical to be described here.\r\n\r\nThe staff was recruited from dons and barristers, men of letters\r\nand stockbrokers, solicitors and merchants; but, until an\r\nincapacitated officer was here and there drafted on light duty\r\nto a government department, there was not one civil servant. The\r\nindependent tributes of Lord Emmott and, later, of Lord Robert\r\nCecil are the most convincing testimony that, even without the\r\nguidance of those who had been trained in the civil service,\r\nthese temporary civil servants acquired its methods and imbibed\r\nsomething of its tradition. Within a few days the raw newcomers\r\nfelt as if they had lived all their lives in a world of registries\r\nand files, of minutes and memoranda, of \"second-division clerks\"\r\nand messengers, as in a few days they were acclimatised to the\r\nuniversal office equipment of trestle-tables and desk-telephones,\r\nof card-indices and steel filing-cabinets, of \"in\" and \"out\" trays,\r\nof rubber stamps and \"urgent\" labels. The work was done first in\r\ncongested corners of Central Buildings, Westminster, later in\r\nBroadway House and later still in Lake Buildings, St. James' Park.\r\nEverywhere the duties of the department expanded more quickly than\r\nits accommodation; and, though it began with apparently sufficient\r\nspace in each new home, within a few weeks the big rooms were being\r\ndivided by temporary partitions and the small were being filled\r\nwith additional occupants.\r\n\r\nAs the civil service has undergone some slight modification in the\r\nlast hundred years, it is encouraging to find that there is also\r\na slight modification in the public estimate of it since Dickens\r\nsatirised the Circumlocution Office. As yet, justice has only been\r\ndone to it by ministers who recognise thankfully that it has no\r\nrival in the world for intellectual ability, conscientiousness,\r\nloyalty, honour and integrity. Recruited by a most searching\r\nexamination from the best brains of the Oxford and Cambridge type,\r\nit receives fewer rewards and less payment than any other body\r\nof men charged with equal responsibility. No \"budget secret\" has\r\never leaked out, though it is in the power of a Treasury clerk\r\nto become rich beyond the dreams of avarice; during the war no\r\nman worked harder than the civil servant. Whether the \"business\r\nmen\" who were acclaimed and imported so eagerly contrived to run\r\ntheir departments more cheaply can be answered by any tax-payer\r\nwho chooses to enquire; that they ran them more efficiently may\r\nbe doubted by any one who recalls the nightmare of confusion in\r\nwhich, say, the Ministry of Munitions came to birth; that they ran\r\nthem with equal integrity may be challenged by small men who were\r\ncompelled to disclose to powerful competitors their organisation\r\nand secret processes.\r\n\r\nThe temporary civil servant may be glad of his experience in a\r\npublic department for many reasons, of which not the least is that\r\nit gave him some idea of the size and complexity of the government\r\nmachine; he might sympathise more with a business man's complaints\r\nif in his correspondence with a government office the business\r\nman were sufficiently businesslike to read what was written and\r\nsufficiently intelligent to understand what he read.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the personnel of the War Trade Department was\r\nremarkably varied and variedly remarkable. The chairman of the\r\nTrade Clearing House, (Sir) Henry Penson was an Oxford economist;\r\nthe head of the Intelligence Section a translator.[32] In a\r\nneighbouring room worked Alfred Sutro; in another, H. W. C. Davis,\r\nof Balliol; in others again would be found a professor, a poet, a\r\npublisher, a critic, a novelist and a historiographer royal.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the war, the department had grown so big that few\r\ncould have known more than half of the men and women in it; during\r\nthe early days, when the machinery of the blockade had still to\r\nbe erected, a small and amazingly harmonious body, contributing\r\ndiverse experience from many countries and callings, established\r\na freemasonry with hard-driven men in other departments; there\r\nwas little obsolete routine; and other offices were not slow to\r\nrecognise sympathetically that an immense burden of work had to be\r\naccomplished with few hands in a short time.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the department changed its domicile several\r\ntimes; it also changed its constitution and title. When Lord Robert\r\nCecil was appointed Minister of Blockade, the Trade Clearing House\r\nsevered its connection with Lord Emmott's War Trade Department and\r\nbecame the War Trade Intelligence Department, under Lord Robert and\r\nin conjunction with such blockade organisations as the Contraband\r\nCommittee and the Foreign Trade Department. At the end of the\r\nwar, its decomposing remains were buried under the Department of\r\nOverseas Trade.\r\n\r\nThe task of preliminary organisation was not made easier by\r\nthe uncertainty into which all government offices were plunged\r\nwhenever a section of the press proclaimed that every department\r\nwas sheltering companies of potential recruits. This is not\r\nthe place to engage in a general discussion of the policy or\r\nthe morality of conscription as imposed, without reference to\r\nthe constituencies, on a country which, six years earlier, had\r\nsupported a liberal government in its contest with the House of\r\nLords. The constitutionalists may object that such a course made\r\nmock of representative government; the idealist may feel that the\r\nachievement of the voluntary system in the first eighteen months of\r\nthe war was the greatest in English history and that no victory is\r\nworth a press-gang; and every critic who is not also a militarist\r\nwill wonder how the army, alone of the services which require to\r\ndraw from the limited common reservoir of man-power, is allowed to\r\nsay that it can fix no maximum but requires all the men that it can\r\nget and then still more.\r\n\r\nThese are general reflections on compulsory service; and, as it\r\nhad been imposed before the summer of 1916, criticism was then\r\nonly relevant when directed to the method of its application.\r\nIf industry was kept in the same uncertainty as the government\r\nservice, it is amazing that industry was not destroyed. The first\r\nprinciple of applied conscription seemed to be that there were no\r\nprinciples: the system of one day was discarded the next; and no\r\npermanent arrangement of work was secure from the risk that a man\r\nexempted on Monday would be called up on Monday week. All men of\r\nmilitary age were periodically reviewed and subjected to medical\r\nreexamination; apart from the waste of time to all concerned\r\nand the occasional incivility of medical boards which attributed\r\nphysical defects to temperamental malice, no personal hardship was\r\ninvolved at first, though, when the doctors were encouraged to pass\r\nas fit for general service a man who had with difficulty qualified\r\nfor \"sedentary duty at home,\" the civil service too often lost a\r\nvaluable worker in presenting to the army a confirmed invalid. The\r\nhardship fell rather on those who were responsible for organising\r\nthe work without being sure who would be left to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen once the machinery of the blockade was perfected, the chief\r\nconcern of the department was to improve and to economise in its\r\nworking. The year 1916 lacked the excitement of those earlier\r\nmonths when the temporary organisations were playing a game,\r\npicking up sides and inventing the rules as they went on; for one\r\namateur civil servant interest only revived with the adhesion of\r\nAmerica to the allies. On Easter-Eve, 1917, the department was\r\nrequested to choose a representative to join the diplomatic mission\r\nwhich was being sent to Washington with Mr. Balfour at its head.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe late war has been described a hundred thousand times as a\r\nlife-and-death struggle. While a soldier may engage in such a\r\nstruggle without allowing his reason to be overmastered by his\r\nnerves, the civilian population at home, learning little and\r\nunderstanding less, is always in some degree influenced by fear\r\nin the formation of its opinions:[33] credit in excess of its\r\nmilitary deserts will be given to the power that joins the war on\r\nthe right side, while opprobrium in excess of its moral turpitude\r\nwill be poured on the power that joins the war on the wrong side or\r\nomits to join it at all. Italy, which forsook the triple alliance\r\nand ran away at Caporetto, is loaded with territorial rewards and\r\npraised as a champion of civilisation, while Turkey, which had no\r\nalliance to forsake and entered the war--like many another--for\r\nwhat could be got out of it, is first vilified and then skinned\r\nalive. It is the fortune of war: by throwing in its lot with the\r\nenemy, the Turkish government embarrassed the allies and increased\r\ntheir despondency; by throwing in its lot with the allies, the\r\nItalian government relieved that embarrassment and lightened that\r\ndespondency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allies would have been strengthened beyond calculation\r\nif, on the outbreak of war, the United States had upheld the\r\nneutrality of Belgium by force of arms; or if, on the sinking of\r\nthe _Lusitania_, they had maintained by force of arms their own\r\nprestige; or if, at any time before 1917 and on any pretext, they\r\nhad eased by military and naval assistance the strain under which\r\nGreat Britain was suffering. It is interesting and, unhappily, not\r\nwholly academic to speculate what Great Britain would have done\r\nor would do in the future if the government of a central or south\r\nAmerican republic appealed to the great powers for assistance in\r\nrepelling an unprovoked Japanese invasion; it is conceivable that\r\nthe notes in which President Wilson defended his neutrality from\r\n1914 to 1917 would constitute a valuable precedent and model for a\r\nBritish foreign secretary in defending his. The public in England\r\ndid not pause to sympathise with a people which aimed at keeping\r\nitself free from the costly heritage of European politics, nor to\r\nunderstand a country in which the interests of the Atlantic coast\r\nwere unintelligible on the coast of the Pacific and both were\r\ndifferent from the interests of the middle west. It did not even\r\npause to record or feel gratitude for the moral, financial and\r\ncharitable support of a big section of the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when President Wilson elected to stand aloof until\r\nthe day when he declared war, Great Britain, despairing of help,\r\ngave herself over to sullen murmuring and periodical explosions.\r\nThat a nation would sooner swallow an indignity than sacrifice its\r\nideal of standing apart from all wars, that it should hope and work\r\nfor a peace in which the victor should not be able to leave the\r\nvanquished only his eyes to weep with was unpalatable in a country\r\nwhich was threatened with starvation at home and with defeat or\r\nstalemate abroad. And no attempt was made to conceal this feeling\r\nof distaste.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, no enthusiasm was too extravagant when at last\r\nAmerica abandoned her neutrality--and abandoned it on the\r\nunidealistic ground of material self-protection. By the autumn\r\nof 1916 the allies had reached their low-water mark. The summer\r\ncampaign on the Somme had cost more than half a million casualties\r\nwithout breaking the German line; the Russian thrust in the\r\nsouth had been repelled and the Russian armies flung back with\r\nsuch violence that they required long leisure for recovery and\r\nre-equipment, if indeed they were ever again to play an effective\r\npart in the war; Servia, left to the undivided attention of\r\nAustria, had been put out of action; and Roumania, entering the\r\nwar precipitously, was now almost expunged from the map of Europe;\r\nif the French had succeeded at Verdun, they had failed everywhere\r\nelse; forgetting everything and learning nothing from the tragedy\r\nof the Dardanelles, the British government had been persuaded\r\nby the French to lock up another army in Salonica; the battle\r\nof Jutland was still widely believed to have been the greatest\r\ndefeat in British naval history; Ireland was smouldering with a\r\nhalf-extinguished half-revolution; and a wave of \"defeatism\" was\r\nspreading through England and France until even the armies were\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nWhen the belligerents took stock before settling down to the\r\ntrench-warfare winter campaign of 1916-17, all must have felt that\r\nthe war had reached its climax. The general exhaustion was so\r\ngreat that, even if hostilities had ceased, every country would\r\nhave been crippled; if hostilities continued, they would continue\r\non a scale of unlimited effort in which no reserve of strength\r\nwould any longer be husbanded. Set free on her eastern frontier,\r\nGermany must mass all her resources in one last effort to break\r\nthrough the western line; the allies must hold out till the attempt\r\nhad spent itself and then strike one last blow at a worn enemy;\r\nGermany must in turn prevent the allies from holding out by cutting\r\ntheir sea-communications. If unrestricted submarine warfare ranged\r\nAmerica on the side of the allies, it must have been felt that\r\neither the war would be over before any effective help could be\r\ngiven or else that, in the final, hopeless, death-grapple, a few\r\nmillion soldiers more or less would not substantially change the\r\ndegree or character of Germany's defeat.\r\n\r\nMany of those who meditate on the war from its climax in 1916\r\nto its end in the Versailles conference may wonder whether they\r\ndid wisely in execrating and howling down any one who shewed the\r\ncourage to advocate peace before the sphere of war underwent its\r\nlast desperate expansion. The government stood by its policy of a\r\n\"knock-out blow\"; the knock-out blow has been dealt. Is any one the\r\nbetter for it? The fire-eaters who proclaimed that anything less\r\nthan the unconditional surrender of Germany would entail another\r\nGerman war within a generation now proclaim with no more doubt or\r\nqualification that Germany is preparing her revenge and has already\r\nrecovered more quickly than any other of the belligerents.[34]\r\nThe added two years of war, then, have not brought such security\r\nas Rome enjoyed after the destruction of Carthage; the added\r\nbitterness of those two years, on the other hand, has made more\r\ndifficult any good-will and any common effort to substitute a saner\r\nand better system of international relationship.\r\n\r\nWorst of all are the world-wide economic depression and political\r\nunrest for which the protraction of the war was responsible. Had\r\nnegotiations been opened in 1916, the Russian revolution and its\r\nconsequences might well have been averted; Germany, Austria and\r\nTurkey might have been left with stable governments and yet with\r\nenough experience of modern warfare to discourage any taste for\r\nfurther adventures; and Italy, France and Great Britain--in that\r\norder--might have been saved from insolvency. The war, if ended at\r\nthat time, would have been ended without American help; and peace\r\nwould have been concluded without American intervention. This last\r\nresult might by now be a matter for regret if thereby the world\r\nhad been cheated of an equitable and permanent peace, such as\r\nPresident Wilson sought to impose on the militarist party of the\r\nVersailles conference; but it would perhaps have been better for\r\nthe terms to be drawn by M. Clemenceau and Mr. Lloyd George on\r\nCarthaginian lines than for the world to be tantalised by a glimpse\r\nof statesmanship that revealed the universal spirit and then to be\r\nfobbed off with a compromise which embraced even the good faith of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOf peace negotiations there was much talk in the last months of\r\n1916; even the cabinet was alleged to have its peace-party; and,\r\nthough the first coalition fell for other reasons, its fall was\r\nmade possible by a vague general belief that one faction was\r\nindifferent whether the war was won or lost and that, if the war\r\nhad to go on, it must be controlled by the faction which was most\r\nvociferously identified with the policy of the knock-out blow.\r\nWhether the most tentative offer was made to Germany or by Germany\r\nhas not been admitted; but informal communications were passing,\r\nfrom the beginning of the war till the end, through unofficial\r\nchannels, and it would interest any one who is dissatisfied with\r\nthe present settlement to know whether the German government\r\nrefused or would have refused a peace in which Belgium, northern\r\nFrance and Russia were evacuated and repaired, in which the authors\r\nof all atrocities were surrendered for trial and in which there\r\nwere neither territorial acquisitions nor indemnities on either\r\nside. For more than this the allies were not entitled to ask, when\r\nthe gamble of war was at its height; with less than this they could\r\nnot be content.\r\n\r\nReturned to power for a second term of office in the November\r\nelections of 1916, President Wilson made a final attempt to open\r\npeace negotiations; but the unrestricted submarine campaign\r\nfrustrated his efforts and impelled him reluctantly to issue a\r\ndeclaration of war: if the allies were defeated, as now seemed\r\nmore than possible, America lay exposed to any power with a fleet\r\nin being. The United States engaged in the war independently and\r\nwithout entering into alliance with any other power; but the\r\nclosest cooperation was expected and invited. To assist this\r\ncooperation, the Foreign Office proposed that a representative\r\nmission should be sent to Washington; and, when the United States\r\ngovernment received the proposal favourably, the mission was\r\nassembled to discuss war-measures with the government of a country\r\nat which the British public and press had been scoffing on the\r\nground that it was \"too proud to fight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAT THE LIBERAL GRAVE-SIDE\r\n\r\n \" ... 'I am no goatherd,' said Faiz Ullah. 'It is against izzat\r\n [my honour].'\r\n\r\n 'When we cross the Bias River again we will talk of izzat,' Scott\r\n replied. 'Till that day thou and the policeman shall be sweepers\r\n to the camp, if I give the order.'\r\n\r\n 'Thus, then, it is done,' grunted Faiz Ullah, 'if the Sahib will\r\n have it so'....\"\r\n\r\n                         RUDYARD KIPLING: _William the Conqueror_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThose who left London for a rare, short holiday between 1914\r\nand 1918 were liable to find that the war followed them into\r\nthe country with agitated headlines and with the daily rolls of\r\nhonour, inevitable and inexorable, with gloomy letters and with\r\nvast departmental files bursting through their official envelopes.\r\nThose who were drawn to America at any time before the end of\r\n1917 found there a people which seemed to realise the war as\r\nlittle as the English had realised it in 1914: the bitterness of\r\ndeath was not yet come. The excitement and preparation of her\r\nfirst entry into world-politics sent hardly a shiver through\r\nthat warm atmosphere of peace and plenty; only the hard-bought\r\nexperience of disorganisation and want, of jealousy and mistrust,\r\nof disappointment and impatience could bring home to America\r\nthe suffering and losses, the occasional hopelessness, the\r\nrecriminations and intrigues, the decline and abandonment of\r\nideals which had overtaken one after another of the belligerents.\r\n\r\nIt was only two and a half years since idealists in England had\r\ntalked of a \"war to end war,\" of international justice and the\r\nrights of small nations, of self-effacement and sacrifice, of a\r\ncrusade and a new way of life. For a few weeks England displayed\r\na great religious enthusiasm: the futility and squalor of the old\r\nworld was sloughed off; a wave of disinterested pity swept over\r\nthe country; there was a rush to arms and to work; old feuds were\r\nforgotten in a magnanimous handshake. How and why did the change\r\ncome?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the conversion was too abrupt; perhaps long uncertainty\r\nand fear, long expectation and sudden knowledge of loss impose too\r\nheavy a strain on tender, unhardy greatness of soul. Death had\r\nhitherto been, for most, a release from suffering or the gentle\r\ntermination of old age; for very few the mutilating rape of youth.\r\nAt one moment, every one in England was clamouring to serve up\r\nto and beyond the limits of his capacity: in the race to the\r\nrecruiting-stations, the old and the halt disguised their age and\r\nhid their infirmities; at another, each man inclined to see first\r\nwhat his neighbour was doing. Why should A fight while B shirked?\r\nWhy should C give all he had, while D amassed riches? Why should\r\nE's husband be left alive when F's had been killed?\r\n\r\nTrust was driven out by suspicion; and for the suspicion there\r\nwas but too good ground. Some men did evade military service or\r\nshelter themselves in fire-proof billets; some made their country's\r\nnecessity their own opportunity; some hoarded coal and gold, food\r\nand oil; there were mistakes of policy and errors of judgement,\r\nas there were German spies and pro-German agents. Of all such,\r\nhowever, there is abundance in every country in every war; and it\r\nis illuminating to find that Ludendorff holds up the morale of\r\nGreat Britain as a model to his own countrymen. Was the strain,\r\nwere the people's defects of character sufficient to justify the\r\nwholesale jettisoning of all the early ideals?\r\n\r\nOr was their sacrifice rejected, were their early ideals betrayed\r\nby a government which cared too little about everything to see\r\nclearly about anything? Two and a half years of war achieved a\r\nseries of contrasts so violent that a man might well rub his eyes\r\nand wonder whether he was in the same country. Great Britain,\r\nat least by the letter of her professions, had entered the war\r\ndisinterestedly to uphold the neutrality of Belgium and to pay a\r\ndebt of honour to France; she had since surrendered so completely\r\nto the acquisitive side of imperialism that she was collecting vast\r\ntracts of territory in Asia, Africa and the Pacific, promising\r\nConstantinople to Russia, Trieste and the Trentino to Italy--the\r\nformer ally of Austria--and Alsace-Lorraine to France. In 1914\r\nthe prime minister had stirred the world with the eloquence of\r\nhis plea for the small nationalities, but the stress of war\r\ninduced him, with colleagues, supporters and opponents bleating\r\njoyous acquiescence, to suspend the home rule act which promised\r\nindependence to at least one small nationality. In an England\r\nlately taught to loathe militarism and autocracy, the life and\r\nliberty of the subject lay so much at the mercy of autocratic\r\nregulations that criticism was stifled. Conscription had been\r\nimposed, with every kind of base capitulation, first to the\r\nincompetence of the War Office, then to the urgency of the press,\r\nthen to sectional rivalries between married and unmarried men. The\r\nrights of minorities and the pleadings of conscience were left to\r\nassert themselves within the four walls of a prison-cell.\r\n\r\nAnd hardly a voice had been raised in protest. When they found that\r\nthe policy of the cabinet was committing tens of millions, without\r\ntheir knowledge, to war, a handful of ministers did indeed resign,\r\nwith less commotion than a man would cause in leaving a table where\r\nthe cards were marked; but of the others who had raved and argued\r\nfor non-intervention all were snugly ensconced in office. The major\r\ncomplaisance made easy the minor; and the party which had left its\r\nprinciples on the threshold before drifting into war drifted into\r\nconscription without realising that it had any more principles to\r\nabandon. Sir John Simon, who had stood forth as the champion of\r\nthe voluntary system, argued half-heartedly from the standpoint\r\nof expediency and resigned when his political influence had\r\nevaporated. And yet this servility to the dictates of government\r\nwas not the result of a splendid resolve to close the ranks and to\r\nsupport the ministry in its hour of crisis: there was no union of\r\nhearts comparable with that effected between the republicans and\r\nthe democrats in America. The united front at home broke down after\r\nthe battle of Neuve Chapelle; and from May 1915 till December 1916\r\nthere was such an orgy of political intrigue as Great Britain had\r\nnot seen in living memory.\r\n\r\nThe battle on the home front was joined on the morrow of the\r\ncampaign which registered the failure of the first British\r\noffensive. Owing to disagreement or misunderstanding between the\r\nmilitary experts, Sir John French at General Headquarters and\r\nLord Kitchener at the War Office, the battle of Neuve Chapelle\r\nwas fought with much shrapnel and little high explosive; Mr.\r\nAsquith, basing himself on his secretary of state for war,\r\nspoke reassuringly at Newcastle on the shell position; but the\r\ncommander-in-chief had by now discovered that high explosive was\r\nwhat he wanted, and on this subject it was impossible to speak\r\nreassuringly. To secure an adequate supply Sir John French put\r\nhimself, through the medium of Captain the Honourable Frederick\r\nGuest, into communication, not with the prime minister nor with\r\nthe secretary of state for war, but, behind their backs, with the\r\nchancellor of the exchequer. Mr. Lloyd George, though equally\r\nresponsible with the rest of the cabinet, now posed before the\r\nworld as the one minister seriously concerned to supply the\r\narmy with munitions, and in his support the godliest and the\r\ngreatest rubbed shoulders: Bishop Furze of Pretoria hurried to the\r\nassistance of the military experts by giving it as his considered\r\nopinion that the Neuve Chapelle failure was due to lack of an\r\nunlimited supply of high-explosive shells; _The Times_ lent its\r\nweight in the same direction. A debate was threatened at the moment\r\nwhen Italy was at last deciding to abandon her neutrality; and,\r\nthough Mr. Asquith had announced but a few hours before that he did\r\nnot contemplate forming a coalition government, his colleagues were\r\ninvited a few hours later to place their resignations in his hands\r\nso that a coalition ministry might be formed.\r\n\r\nThe liberal party was not consulted until the decision had been\r\ntaken; and the men who had answered every demand on their loyalty\r\nfor five, six and eight years were sufficiently disgruntled to\r\ncall a meeting of protest. With the prime minister's entrance,\r\nindignation turned to sympathy; he was urged into the chair, and\r\nafter an explanation in which nothing was explained, the meeting\r\ndispersed, bright-eyed with emotion, to a murmured chorus of \"Trust\r\nthe P.M.\" In the reconstruction of the ministry, room had to be\r\nfound for as many unionists as liberals; and, as at this time Mr.\r\nLloyd George was advertising for \"a man of push and go\" to control\r\nthe supply of munitions, the principle of coalition government was\r\ndefined as one in which the tories pushed and the liberals went.\r\n\r\nThis idea of fusion, with its amnesty of principles, its\r\nabandonment of awkward party controversies and its escape from\r\nembarrassing party opposition, was perhaps a greater novelty to\r\nthe House of Commons than to the new head of the new Ministry of\r\nMunitions. To the coalition principle he is said to have been\r\nattracted for years before the war;[35] he remained faithful to\r\nit until the end; and, with the conclusion of the armistice, he\r\nexalted it into an article of political faith, which to reject\r\nwas tantamount to instant death at the political stake; even now,\r\nwhen peace has been signed, the need for coalition government has,\r\nin his eyes, not yet abated. The change that overcame Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge's mind between the battle of Neuve Chapelle and the December\r\ncrisis of 1916 was that, in addition to the need for a coalition,\r\nhe saw the need for himself at its head.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBefore the House of Commons and the country could be prepared for\r\nthe change of government in war-time, they had to be convinced\r\nthat the old administration not only had failed in the past, but\r\nwas doomed to fail in the future. One bird in the coalition nest\r\nhad to foul it until the offence cried to heaven; thereafter the\r\nnest could be rebuilt and repopulated. So, for a year and a half,\r\nthere was always one member of the government to dissociate himself\r\nfrom his colleagues and to point sorrowfully to mistakes for which\r\nhis sorrow appeared to absolve him from responsibility. Owing to\r\ndelay, mismanagement or lack of preparation, Neuve Chapelle, Loos\r\nand the Somme by land, Jutland by sea had achieved no decision;\r\nthe Gallipoli and Mesopotamia campaigns had ended in smoke and\r\nblood. The difficulty of raising new drafts, of equipping them and\r\nof feeding the civilian population was magnified by a press which\r\nministers scorned to make sympathetic. Ireland had been goaded into\r\nrevolt and was being held quiet by force. As a record of failure,\r\nmuch platform capital could be made out of the government's\r\nsuccession of disasters.[36]\r\n\r\nWhether any other government made fewer mistakes absolutely,\r\nwhether it was generous to emphasise these catastrophes and\r\nto disregard the practical achievements, future historians\r\nmust determine. The whole of Great Britain and of the British\r\nEmpire had been brought unanimously and enthusiastically into\r\nthe war; an unmilitary nation had raised and armed millions of\r\nmen; it was spending thousands of millions of pounds each year;\r\nit was blockading the enemy and policing the seas. It was not,\r\nunfortunately, breaking the German line in the West nor the Turkish\r\nline in the East. Generosity was not a conspicuous quality among\r\nthe men who were engaged in breaking the home front.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Asquith's eternal credit he rated unity in cabinet and\r\ncountry higher than any tactical advantage that he might have\r\nsecured by a dialectical brawl with his energetic lieutenant. Mr.\r\nLloyd George, who was now so anxious to \"get on with the war,\" had\r\nbeen less anxious to follow his chief into war at the outset; \"too\r\nlate here,\" he complained, \"too late there,\" but in every decision,\r\nwere it the Dardanelles expedition or the shell controversy, he\r\nshared full and equal responsibility with the head and every member\r\nof the cabinet, he could have resigned in protest--and with greater\r\ndignity than he shewed in rounding upon his colleagues for mistakes\r\nin which he participated. From the time of Lord Kitchener's death\r\nuntil the December crisis, he was himself secretary of state for\r\nwar with a predominant voice in all military decisions.\r\n\r\nIt was easier to forget his own record and to focus the attention\r\nof his audience upon the future. After the failure of the Somme\r\noffensive, the apparent failure of the Jutland action, another\r\nwinter campaign became inevitable; food was running short and\r\nwould become shorter if German submarines were given free play;\r\nthe evidence collected by the Dardanelles commissioners threw\r\na disturbing light on the happy-go-lucky methods of cabinet\r\ngovernment; ministers were allowing themselves to be bullied\r\nin the House of Commons; and from a hundred different quarters\r\nthere gathered a hundred thousand wisps and wreaths of fog which\r\nintensified in a tarnishing cloud of mistrust and disapproval.\r\nUnder the military service act a man could appeal for exemption on\r\nthe ground that he was indispensable in his present employment;\r\nfrom the first days of the war Mr. Asquith was hailed as the\r\nindispensable prime minister. It is impossible to draw any chart\r\nto shew the change in psychological attitude towards him; but by\r\nthe autumn of 1916, perhaps on the day when he persuaded parliament\r\nto accept conscription and imposed it upon the country without\r\na revolution, he was no longer indispensable; very soon the\r\nantagonism strengthened into a feeling that the war would never be\r\nwon so long as he remained at the head of the government.\r\n\r\nThis feeling was crystallised by Mr. Lloyd George in a memorandum\r\nwhich proposed that a committee of three, excluding the prime\r\nminister, should have full direction of the war. Discussion and\r\ncorrespondence followed; the proposal was made public in _The\r\nTimes_ of December 4th; there was one day's more correspondence,\r\nending with Mr. Asquith's abrupt announcement on December 5th that\r\nhe had tendered his resignation to the king. It seemed unlikely,\r\nto the outside spectator, that either Mr. Bonar Law or Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge would be able to form a new administration, if, as was\r\nexpected, the liberal and unionist ministers remained loyal to\r\ntheir old chief in resisting an ambitious colleague's effort to\r\nsupplant him; but those responsible for the upheaval were leaving\r\nnothing to chance in the \"well-organised, carefully engineered\r\nconspiracy\" which Mr. Asquith described as being \"directed\" in\r\npart against some of his late unionist colleagues, but in the\r\nmain against Lord Grey and himself. Mr. Bonar Law lost no time in\r\nhanding on to Mr. Lloyd George the opportunity of an experiment\r\nin cabinet-making; the unionist members had been approached in\r\nadvance, Mr. Balfour and Lord Robert Cecil consented to take office\r\nand the small fry followed their lead.\r\n\r\nSo perished the first coalition, the liberal party and the\r\npolitical ascendancy of Mr. Asquith. Now, as before, his supporters\r\nwere not consulted any more than when he plunged them into the\r\nfirst coalition or incurred that earlier debt of honour which\r\nwas not an obligation, but which had the compelling force of an\r\nobligation in committing them to hostilities; though he expected\r\nand received their fealty throughout the first two and a half\r\nyears of war, he never found it necessary to take them into his\r\nconfidence before sacrificing every principle of liberalism,\r\nplacing every liberal pledge in suspense and, at the end,\r\nabdicating from his half of the political throne. Ministers had an\r\nunchallenged, victorious majority; there was no adverse vote; the\r\nwhite flag fluttered into view before a shot had been fired; and\r\nit was not until he assembled the liberal party at the Reform Club\r\non December 8th and hinted at the conspiracy before which he had\r\nretired that the party knew its fate. By that time the majority of\r\nthe party was grown restive under this one-sided loyalty.\r\n\r\nThose were days of terrible passion and bitterness. No abuse was\r\ntoo strong for the perfidy of Mr. Lloyd George on the one hand or\r\nthe lethargy of Mr. Asquith on the other. Ingratitude and bad faith\r\nwere spluttered from one set of lips; incompetence and indifference\r\nfrom the other. A \"defeatist\" cabal in the cabinet was discovered\r\nor invented; and ministers were accused of not winning the war\r\nbecause they did not want to win the war. More than four years\r\nhave passed since that black week and it is still too early to\r\nreturn an impartial verdict. No one is likely to question that Mr.\r\nAsquith's loyalty and generosity to his colleagues are without\r\nparallel in our political history: throughout the vulgarity of the\r\nLimehouse campaign, the tragi-comedy of Mr. Churchill's Sidney\r\nStreet offensive and the squalor of the Marconi scandal, the prime\r\nminister's wide and indulgent cloak was ever at the disposal of\r\nthe intemperate youngsters of his cabinet; never was indulgence\r\nrepaid with blacker treachery. Those who like to fancy the workings\r\nof providence in human affairs may think that, as Mr. Asquith\r\nneglected and misled his party more thoroughly than any other prime\r\nminister, so he was overtaken by a more malignant nemesis.\r\n\r\nTo suggest that he would have lost the war, if he had continued in\r\noffice, is hardly less fantastic than to believe that Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge won it. A press-ridden people is liable to exaggerate the\r\ndifference between one prime minister and another; by 1917 a\r\nnumber of amateurs had learned something of war, and the new prime\r\nminister profited by experience as the old would have done; but\r\nthrough the organised clamour and dust of the next two years it\r\nis hard to discern a single act of courage or of decision which\r\nranks higher than the day-by-day courage and decision displayed\r\nby the government in the first half of the war or which entitled\r\nMr. Lloyd George more than Mr. Asquith to be regarded as a great\r\nwar-minister. It was under Mr. Asquith's rule that the country was\r\nconverted from peace to war, that the great armies were raised and\r\nall but one of the great alliances concluded. If Mr. Lloyd George\r\ncan claim credit for the unification of the higher command, he must\r\nallow that from no one but Mr. Asquith would conscription have\r\nbeen accepted; his own effort in 1918 to raise the age-limit and\r\nto include Ireland was hardly a triumph of practical efficiency or\r\nof political honesty. The difficulties of administration had, if\r\nanything, decreased by 1917: if Russia was no longer dependable,\r\nAmerica--with all her resources of food, money and men--came to\r\nredress the balance. While Mr. Lloyd George's buoyant and inspiring\r\noptimism deserves all praise, Mr. Asquith's optimism, if more\r\nrestrained, was no less constant; his determination, even when no\r\nlonger in office, to prosecute the war with all possible vigour\r\nwas a cause of perplexity and of offence to those of his party who\r\nwished him to lead a movement in favour of a negotiated peace and\r\nto those who hoped to see him retaliating on the new government for\r\nthe guerilla so long waged against himself.\r\n\r\nAs the fate of the country they governed is more important than\r\nthat of either man, so the fate of the party they led is more\r\nimportant than the transitory fortune of its leader. One who\r\nlunched at the Reform Club on December 8th, in sight of Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's portrait, may perhaps be excused for thinking\r\nof the library overhead and of the shattered host that listened\r\nthere to the belated apologetics of its leader; he may be pardoned\r\nfor putting on those kindly, shrewd lips the words: \"_Vare, legions\r\nredde_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEven the rout of the liberal party is inconsiderable by\r\ncomparison with the death of liberalism which took place that\r\nday. The old shibboleths of peace, economy, personal liberty and\r\ninternationalism were discarded; when next liberal candidates\r\nmade profession of faith, they deafened themselves with a cry for\r\nrevenge and for indemnities which could not be exacted, until the\r\n\"war to end war\" culminated in a peace to end peace. Forgotten were\r\nthe aspirations of August 1914; nationality was blessed in the\r\ndistant security of Czecho-Slovakia but ignored in Ireland; of the\r\nideals with which Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's lost legions had\r\ncome into power there remained not one, of practical achievement\r\ntheir record shewed little more than a statute-book cumbered\r\nby bold acts of parliament which their authors had rendered\r\ninoperative.\r\n\r\nThe generation that saw the liberalism on which it had been\r\nreared stricken to the ground by the annihilating onrush of war\r\nstill hoped that, with the halting approach of peace, liberalism\r\nmight raise its head again. Among the faithful are numbered the\r\nardent and generous spirits of every generation; and the faith\r\nis imperishable even though from time to time it lack a prophet\r\nor a leader. It is inspired by compassion for all who are any\r\nway afflicted in mind, body or estate and it exists to relieve\r\naffliction by the gift of freedom. Liberty to sleep and wake and\r\nwork and love, secure from the oppression of a despotic ruler or\r\na strong neighbour; liberty to win the best from life, unhampered\r\nby hunger or thirst, by cold or disease, by ignorance or fear;\r\nliberty to enjoy the fruits of labour and to engage in the pursuit\r\nof happiness; liberty for a man to do whatsoever he wishes,\r\nprovided that he does not infringe the liberty of his neighbour:\r\nall this is included in the faith of liberalism, which embraces\r\nalso the liberty of the smaller aggregates, which we call classes,\r\nand of the larger aggregates, which we call nations, to mould their\r\nown destinies and to pursue, each in its own way, its own ideal of\r\nhappiness. It is a militant faith, for, when compassion slumbers,\r\nthe need for liberty and the faith in liberty are dead; it is kept\r\never alert and brightly armoured by the just young, who cannot\r\ntolerate that millions of their fellow creatures should begin\r\nlife handicapped, and by the merciful, who believe that active or\r\npassive cruelty is the root of all evil and the mark of original\r\nsin. What a man becomes in later life is conditioned by the scars\r\nwhich the struggle for existence leaves upon him; for the man who\r\nwas not a liberal in youth, there may be pity, but there can be no\r\nhope. The men who risked anything or everything in the war attached\r\nvarious labels to their political beliefs, but the act of sacrifice\r\nmade liberals of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the crisis of December, 1916, fewer tears were shed for\r\nfallen liberal idols than for unpedestalled liberal ministers,\r\nand compassion was too much needed at home to be spared for\r\nexport; now, as then, less righteous indignation is engendered\r\nby the collapse of liberalism than by the defection of prominent\r\nliberals. Captain Guest and Mr. Shortt, Sir Alfred Mond and Mr.\r\nChurchill, Dr. Addison and Mr. Macpherson, Sir Hamar Greenwood and\r\nMr. Harmsworth, Sir Gordon Hewart and Mr. Montagu are felt by \"wee\r\nfree\" liberals to have sold their master; a year ago,[37] some of\r\nthem were publicly acclaimed as \"rats\" and denied a hearing. Those\r\nwho remained loyal to Mr. Asquith dropped gently out of political\r\nprominence until the general election of 1918 dropped them less\r\ngently out of public life. A British political faith has never been\r\nso completely and tidily demolished as was British liberalism, with\r\nits organisation and its army, at the hands of a Welsh solicitor,\r\nan Irish newspaper proprietor, a Canadian financier and their\r\nsatellites, aided by the inexorable logic of events.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of liberalism was carried out with more despatch\r\nthan solemnity. On the night of Mr. Asquith's resignation the\r\npoliticians separated at once into those who had surrendered\r\noffice and those who hoped to fill the vacant places. _Le roy\r\nest mort; vive le roy!_ Though Irish, English and Scotch were\r\nbeing killed on a dozen fronts, no time was being wasted at home;\r\nas in the political crisis after Neuve Chapelle, more than one\r\nsoldier-politician had returned to London in full readiness to lay\r\naside his sword in exchange for a portfolio; and before Mr. Bonar\r\nLaw had visited the king, a \"new gang\" leader might have been\r\noverheard enquiring of an \"old gang\" minister how much he had got\r\nout of the \"pool\" of ministerial salaries. The mission to America\r\noffered to its members a welcome holiday from English politics.\r\n\r\nIn those days any holiday from London would have been acceptable.\r\nMost of those who passed their time in government offices were\r\noverworked; almost all of them _ex hypothesi_ were in one way or\r\nanother unfit; all were stale. Their blood unfired by hand-to-hand\r\nfighting, they became unconscious victims of despondency which\r\nbore no accurate relation to the fluctuating fortune of war. While\r\nit is probably true that in the winter before America entered the\r\nwar, when the reservoir of men was running dry, when food had first\r\nto be rationed and England was threatened with the \"unrestricted\"\r\nsubmarine campaign, there was better reason for depression than in\r\nSeptember 1914 or March 1918, when the danger was past before it\r\nhad been fully realised, it is also true that depression continued\r\nwhen improving news from the front should have relieved it. There\r\nis a close connection between a temporarily weakening morale and\r\nthe first decline in the standard of living: by the end of 1916\r\nfood was deteriorating in quality and quantity; digestion and\r\nnerves were affected; bodily vitality became impaired. There is\r\na connection no less close between mental vitality and light; an\r\nill-lit room produces low spirits, and London was ill-lit after\r\nthe first threat of an air-raid. Further, the health of mind and\r\nof body is dependent on sleep; and, if a civilian may criticise\r\nthe strategy of the German air-service, it may be suggested that\r\nit would have done better to aim at breaking British morale by\r\nkeeping Britain awake at night. The material achievement of the\r\nraiders must have been disappointing to the German general staff:\r\nthe destruction of life was insignificant; the damage to property\r\ntrifling; it may be doubted whether the bombs dropped on railways,\r\nmunition works and public buildings retarded the pace of the war by\r\nan hour; there was no widespread panic; the civilian population was\r\nnever driven to sue prematurely for peace, the seat of government\r\nwas never transferred. To this extent the air-raids were a failure.\r\n\r\nIf this contention be just, the most successful phase of the\r\ncampaign was reached one week when there were six raid nights in\r\nsuccession. London was, in consequence, fretful and neurotic. While\r\nno one had the honesty to admit that he was frightened by raids,\r\na few would admit their effect on the nerves of others. With the\r\napproach of evening the anxious Londoner calculated from the age of\r\nthe moon and the height of the wind that it was, perhaps, a \"good\r\nnight for the Gothas.\" \"I wonder whether they'll come to-night,\"\r\nhe would observe conversationally, as he went in to dinner; and,\r\nwhether they came or not, the atmosphere was affected by vague,\r\nhardly perceptible uneasiness. When the attack was inopportunely\r\ntimed, dinner would be interrupted while children were flushed from\r\nbed and littered down in hall or cellar. Every taxi disappeared\r\nfrom the streets, the tube stations were filled with highly\r\nscented aliens and the anxious Londoner walked home between the\r\nbombardments of the anti-aircraft guns, perhaps to find that he was\r\nhomeless, roofless or windowless. After a broken night, he awoke\r\nwith a headache; and, if government offices were representative of\r\nLondon as a whole, a proportion of the morning would be spent in\r\nexchanging anecdotes of the raid.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAt mid-day on the Wednesday in Easter week, after one or two false\r\nstarts, the members of Mr. Balfour's mission entered a private bay\r\nat Euston, where the presence of a special train aroused among\r\nthe porters mild speculation which died away in the opinion that\r\nthe king was making an unadvertised journey. The Admiralty was\r\nrepresented by Rear-Admiral Sir Dudley de Chair and Fleet-Paymaster\r\nLawford; the War Office by Major-General (Sir) Tom Bridges, Colonel\r\nSpender-Clay, Colonel Dansey and Major Rees; the Foreign Office by\r\nLord Eustace Percy, Mr. Maurice Peterson, Mr. A. Paton and (Sir)\r\nGeoffrey Butler; the Board of Trade by Mr. F. P. Robinson; the\r\nWheat Commission by (Sir) Alan Anderson; the Ministry of Munitions\r\nby Mr. W. P. Layton and Mr. M. L. Phillips; the Bank of England by\r\nits governor, Lord Cunliffe. Mr. Balfour's personal staff consisted\r\nof Sir Eric Drummond, (Sir) Ian Malcolm and Mr. Cecil Dormer. A\r\nlater boat was to bring others who joined the mission in Washington.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock the special train left Euston for a port chosen\r\nby the Admiralty, but not disclosed. At a time chosen by the\r\nAdmiralty, the mission was to embark on an unknown ship for an\r\nunknown destination on the western side of the Atlantic, there to\r\nescape for a few weeks from the imminence of war and to look upon a\r\ncountry which seemed own sister to the England which all had known\r\nbefore August 4, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nON THE ROAD TO WASHINGTON--AND AFTER\r\n\r\n \"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this\r\n continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the\r\n proposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\n \"Now we are engaged in a great ... war, testing whether that\r\n nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long\r\n endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war....

Greenock\r\nStation rumour says that our mission of twenty, with ten servants\r\nand sixty to eighty pieces of baggage, is carrying bullion....\r\nSome little time on a perishingly cold tender, before boarding\r\n\"Olympic.\" This ... has been for some little time a troopship;\r\nit is in fact heavily loaded with ... Canadian ... wives who are\r\nbeing repatriated; it contains three hundred to four hundred ...\r\nbabies, all with ... a yell on their lips; finally, it has been\r\nwaiting for the mission some six days, being ready to sail last\r\nFriday.... Consequently, when the Secretary of State mounted the\r\ngangway, followed by a score of men carrying a despatch-box in\r\neither hand ... the cheers rang out over the grey waters of the\r\nClyde. \"I cannot help feeling that they were ironical,\" murmured A.\r\nJ. B., as we sat down to sardines on toast, cold ham and whiskey at\r\nmidnight.... Unconscious of their doom, the little victims cheered,\r\nnot guessing that the Admiralty's reason for stopping us yesterday\r\nwas the discovery of a brand-new minefield outside Loch Swilly.\r\nI am told that we shall not start till Saturday, as a further\r\nmission, principally from the W.O. and M. of M. is due to start on\r\nthat day; perhaps we shall wait for it. When, therefore, we arrive\r\nor start back, no man can say. Drummond_ [Mr. Balfour's principal\r\nprivate secretary] _thinks it probable that we shall spend a week\r\nin Canada before returning._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Friday, April 13th._\r\n\r\n_An inauspicious day for starting, say the superstitious; but,\r\nthough the Blue Peter tremble in the breeze, I see no likelihood\r\nof our moving.... Rumour, which is as busy on board the \"Olympic\"\r\nas elsewhere, has discovered that the midnight mission was not a\r\nmission at all, but a clandestine escape and that the £800 suite\r\n'midships contains not the Secretary of State, but the ex-Czar of\r\nall the Russias.... No hopes of a start till to-morrow...._\r\n\r\n  _Saturday, April 14th._\r\n\r\n_Worked industriously ... until noon, when ears were caught by\r\nwelcome sound of anchor being raised. Guns, four forward and\r\ntwo aft, were swung into position; three destroyers, like angry\r\ndragon-flies, appeared from nowhere and flew ahead; orders issued\r\nfor every man, woman and child to put, and keep, on life-belt.\r\nBidden by Drummond to lunch with Secretary of State in his\r\ncabin...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Sunday, April 15th._\r\n\r\n_Twenty hours out from Greenock. Our escort has left us, we no\r\nlonger steer a zigzag course; and high speed, coupled with a bit\r\nof a roll, a bit of a pitch and considerable cold has thinned the\r\nranks of the passengers.... The Atlantic, considering its size, is\r\namazingly deserted._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Monday, April 16th._\r\n\r\n_Fairly smooth, settled down to work in earnest.... Dormer told\r\nme that, the night we were due to sail, every British west-coast\r\nport was carefully mined. Hence our stay at Dumfries. The ship's\r\ncompany has been very busy making a wood-and-canvas imitation of\r\na submarine periscope; this is to be flung overboard to-morrow,\r\nand punctually at 11.0 our guns will try to sink it. Hope they\r\nsucceed; otherwise, a lifelike periscope cruising at large over\r\nwide Atlantic will distress a number of innocent packets._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Tuesday, April 17th._\r\n\r\n_Delightfully warm; steaming well south. This an agreeable surprise\r\nafter being told that we were due to run into a cold patch over\r\nthe Banks.... Gun practise took place, as advertised; £7 per shell.\r\nAs the wood-and-canvas mock-periscope sank shortly after being\r\nlaunched, there was no very satisfactory target, but the gunners\r\nhad still the wide Atlantic at which to shoot and on several\r\noccasions I observed them hit it. Noise disconcerting, but nothing\r\nto consequent uproar, when 400 children all began to cry at once.\r\nHowever, if they had not been crying at the guns, they would have\r\ncried at something else.... Vernon Castle, who in happier times\r\nwaltzes in and out the supper-tables of New York and London in\r\ncompany with his wife, happens to be on board, as an airman._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Wednesday, April 18th._\r\n\r\n_Weather getting warmer each day.

The wireless communiqués seem to grow\r\nmore satisfactory each day.

By midnight we ran into a\r\ndense fog and spent the night almost motionless with the fog-horn\r\nblowing at three-minute intervals. An escort came out to meet\r\nus, but turned tail on failing to find us. Halifax harbour is\r\nimposing[39]--an immense stretch of water with hills on either\r\nside and an October-morning haze gradually disappearing before the\r\nsun. The mission will shortly disintegrate, as the M. of M. and\r\nthe Wheat Commission are going to New York. On dropping anchor,\r\nwe were boarded by an embassage from the Governor-General of\r\nCanada, consisting of Admiral Browning, his naval staff, the G.\r\nG.'s military secretary and others. We are bidden to lunch on the\r\n\"Leviathan.\" Telegrams are flying between Halifax and Washington to\r\ndiscover when the U.S.A. Government would like us to arrive...._\r\n\r\n_Went on board \"Leviathan\" ... and was entertained most hospitably\r\nby ward-room officers; taken ashore in launch and spent hour\r\ninspecting Halifax.

Two days in the hottest train on\r\nrecord rather trying...._\r\n\r\n_Arrived safely at Washington.... We had a pilot engine running\r\nfrom the frontier before us, another following, the line guarded\r\nand the route not disclosed. Despite this, the U.S. head of the\r\nEastern Command states that sleepers were laid across the line last\r\nnight with intent to wreck the train._\r\n\r\n_The mission was received by Secretary Lansing and most of the\r\nBritish Embassy Staff, a U.S. naval band, a crowd and several\r\ncars, which were then escorted by troops of cavalry.... Called\r\nat Embassy.... Summer weather prevailing; and spring leaves and\r\nflowers everywhere._\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Balfour mission remained in Washington from Sunday, April\r\n22nd, until Thursday, May 24th, when it set out on its return\r\njourney through Canada. During that time Mr. Balfour and some of\r\nhis colleagues paid short visits to other places, and almost the\r\nentire mission went up to New York for the week-end which had been\r\nset aside for its reception. Apart from this, as soon as they had\r\nestablished contact with their respective departments, most members\r\nwere kept too busy to leave Washington: for seven days a week,\r\nall day and part of the night, they divided their time between\r\nthe Embassy, the various departments, the headquarters of the\r\nmission in Mr. Secretary Breckenridge Long's house and the mission\r\noffices--opposite the Embassy--on Connecticut Avenue.\r\n\r\nNo one who has ever been to the United States needs to be told\r\nthat the mission was shewn the most lavish hospitality: city and\r\ncountry clubs extended honorary membership to it; public and\r\nprivate parties and receptions were given in its honour; and the\r\nState Department seconded Mr. Winslow and Mr. Hugh Gibson to the\r\nspecial duty of looking after it. While it would be of doubtful\r\ninterest and undoubted impropriety to describe the negotiations\r\nand discussions which took place, it may be said in general terms\r\nthat the mission was charged with the duty of collaborating in all\r\nwar measures which the United States government took, furnishing\r\ninformation and coordinating the work of the corresponding\r\ndepartments. A few further extracts from the diary already cited\r\nwill indicate everything, not closed with a confidential seal, that\r\nhappened to one member of the mission during his four or five\r\nweeks' sojourn in Washington.\r\n\r\n _Monday, April 23rd._\r\n\r\n _ ... Conference at Embassy at 10.20 to apportion work of\r\n mission.... Made exhaustive inspection of city: Washington\r\n Memorial, Capitol, Congress, Congressional Library, River Potomac,\r\n baseball grounds, Federal Museum and the like. Returning to\r\n luncheon at hotel met my friend Sir Hardman Lever, Financial\r\n Secretary of Treasury, who has been regulating Anglo-American\r\n finance in corner of J. P. Morgan's office for four months and has\r\n now come up from New York to join mission. Invited to lunch with\r\n him, Lady Lever and private secretary...._\r\n\r\n _Reception at White House; presented to President Wilson. Similar\r\n receptions in England would be made more tolerable if we adopted\r\n American practise of encouraging guests to smoke._\r\n\r\n\r\n _Tuesday, April 24th._\r\n\r\n _Paid visit to Trade Department of Embassy to ascertain how\r\n Washington conducts its end of our work....

Then, in tall hat, to Navy Yard and embarked on\r\nPresident's yacht, \"Mayflower,\" to be received by Secretary of\r\nNavy Josephus Daniels, in company with entire British and French\r\nmissions and fair slice of administration and Congress.... On\r\ncoming level with Mount Vernon, the band played \"The Star-Spangled\r\nBanner,\" officers and men saluted, and the rest stood to attention.\r\nPut off in launches, landed and climbed hill to Washington's tomb\r\nwhere for first time in history Union Jack was flying (in company\r\nwith the Stars-and-Stripes and Tricoleur). Eloquent speech by\r\nViviani, who ended by placing wreath on tomb; followed by Secretary\r\nof State, shorter and even more eloquent, who in turn laid wreath\r\non tomb in name of British Mission;[40] Marshal Joffre and General\r\nBridges mounting guard the while beside the tomb. Proceeded\r\nuphill to Washington's house, which stands on a magnificent site\r\noverlooking Potomac with beautiful scenery all round. House itself,\r\nwhite-walled, red-roofed, colonnaded and decorated in best Adam\r\nstyle, is preserved by pious body of female Regents in almost\r\nexactly same condition as when Washington was alive: there is the\r\nsame vista which he cut through trees so that he could see guests\r\ncoming miles away over richest English lawn at lodge gates. The\r\nhouse and out-houses, running in crescent away from river, are\r\nas he designed and left them, including smoke-house for curing,\r\nspinning-house and a dozen more. The gardens are as he laid them\r\nout, with box hedges, now grown to breast height, enclosing just\r\nsuch flowers as he knew in his day; and there are trees planted by\r\nLafayette, when staying with him. To me two most interesting relics\r\ninside house were large wooden trunk marked \"Geo. Washington:\r\nVirginia\" and, at other end of life, key of Bastille, sent him by\r\nLafayette shortly after 14th July, '89. Altogether an object-lesson\r\nin preservation of public monuments._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Sunday, May 6th._\r\n\r\n_Sunday is, of course, a day of rest. I worked half the morning\r\nat the Shoreham, the other half at the Embassy; lunched at the\r\nMetropolitan and returned to Embassy till 6.0 p.m. At 6.0 repaired\r\nto La Fayette Hotel, thence to a business dinner given by Eustace\r\nPercy at the Shoreham. We sat down at 6.30, of all ungodly hours,\r\ntalked shop throughout the meal and sped away to the Department of\r\nCommerce. There until 1.30 a.m. we did the real work of the Trade\r\nSection of the Mission: Eustace Percy, Peterson, Broderick (our\r\nAssistant Commercial Adviser) and myself...._\r\n\r\n_Returned to Shoreham at 1.45 a.m._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Monday, May 7th._\r\n\r\n_ ...

Winston Churchill, the American\r\nnovelist...._\r\n\r\n  _Saturday, May 12th._\r\n\r\n_After hot and restless night reached New York at 7.0 a.m. Motored\r\ndown town, called on publishers and drove to Equitable Buildings,\r\nwhere on 39th floor, reached by express non-stop elevator, the\r\nBankers' Club is palatially installed. A considerable view of New\r\nYork is obtainable from a thirty-ninth floor.... Drove slowly up\r\nBroadway_ (_the height of the buildings and the slowness of traffic\r\nare the two most noticeable things to a newcomer_)....\r\n\r\n_Dined at super-palatial Metropolitan (on Fifth Avenue) with\r\nAmerican committee of British Red Cross. ... Adjourned to Carnegie\r\nHall, where grand patriotic show had been arranged. Mission\r\ncomfortably housed in half a dozen first-tier boxes; house\r\ndecorated throughout with flags of the Allies; war-pictures,\r\npatriotic songs and national anthems ad lib.; suddenly everyone\r\nleapt to his feet and cheered, looking in our direction. Reason\r\nwas that Secretary of State had just entered his box with Choate,\r\nformerly U.S. Ambassador in London.[41] At end of performance\r\nentire house rose once more and cheered itself hoarse, shouting\r\n\"Balfour! Balfour!\" until Secretary of State consented to deliver\r\nshort speech...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Monday, May 14th._\r\n\r\n_Reached Washington in time for breakfast. Then to the Department\r\nof Commerce, then to the Capitol. Heard Senate debating the\r\nEspionage Bill, of which one or two provisions will affect the\r\nwar trade policy and powers of the U.S.G.... Crossed to House of\r\nRepresentatives and heard debate on Revenue Bill._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Thursday, May 17th._\r\n\r\n_Divided morning between Embassy and Hotel. At noon drove to\r\nMission House for interesting ceremony. The Senate and Alpha of\r\nVirginia Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Fraternity were convoked to\r\nelect into its membership Arthur James Balfour, Cecil Spring-Rice\r\nand members of the British Commission. The Phi Beta Kappa was\r\nfounded at William and Mary College, as a quasi-masonic students'\r\nfraternity, in 1776; and, though its secret ritual has now been\r\nmade public and its oath is now largely formal, it has continued\r\never since and has spread all over the States. One or two of\r\nthe most distinguished members of a college are, I understand,\r\nadmitted to it every year, but honorary membership is the rarest of\r\ncompliments, reserved hitherto for a handful of men such as Lord\r\nBryce. To quote the President and the Secretary of State, it was\r\nthe highest academic distinction that America could confer or we\r\nreceive._\r\n\r\n_Assembling in an ante-room, the ten of us who happened to be\r\ngraduates of Oxford or Cambridge marched in and were greeted by the\r\nPresident of the Federation on behalf of the Senate and Deputies\r\nof the Alpha of Virginia. Our names were called by one Senator,\r\nand the President made an admirable speech. The President of the\r\nCollege of William and Mary initiated us into the history and\r\nmystery of the Fraternity, and the Rector of the college presented\r\neach of us with a leather case, stamped with our name, containing\r\nthe gold key of membership, also stamped with our name, the date,\r\nthe device of the fraternity and the date of its formation. The\r\noath was then read, and the grip was explained and given. A speech\r\nin reply by the Secretary of State on behalf of the mission ended\r\nthe proceedings, and the Senate was adjourned. We thereupon\r\ndivested ourselves of our robes and drove to the apartment of\r\nSenator Hollis Godfrey, where we were entertained to luncheon.\r\nAltogether a charming and most interesting ceremony._\r\n\r\n_After luncheon I was introduced to Sir Ernest Shackleton, the\r\nantarctic explorer, who is staying in Washington. An early\r\ndinner, after which I attended the Colonial Memorial Hall to hear\r\nShackleton deliver a most interesting lecture, illustrated by\r\nadmirable photographs, on his last \"relative failure,\" as he calls\r\nit, in antarctic exploration._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Sunday, May 20th._\r\n\r\n_Rose and appeared at Department of Commerce to be greeted by\r\nmuscular janitor with six-shooter.... Spent morning arranging what\r\nI hope will be almost last details of department as it is to be set\r\nup here, ranging in my stride from the cubic feet of office space\r\nto be occupied down to the number of dollars to be paid weekly to\r\nthe char-ladies.... Motored out to Arlington, Robert E. Lee's old\r\nhome, now the military cemetery of America and the most beautiful\r\nthat I have ever seen. It stretches over 6,000 acres of valley,\r\nwith magnificent timber and winding drives and an open circular\r\ntemple, from which addresses are delivered on Thanksgiving Day.\r\nThe arrangement and style of the graves are in excellently simple\r\ntaste. For the unknown dead of the Civil War there are plain square\r\nstones, a foot high; when the identity of any number is discovered,\r\nthe stone is rounded at the corners and the name engraved._\r\n\r\n_On leaving Arlington, we motored past the great wireless station\r\nwith the Potomac and Washington lying below, back to the city._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Thursday, May 24th._\r\n\r\n_To President's private entrance at station. Dansey and Butler\r\nwho are staying behind, saw us off on behalf of mission, Tom\r\nSpring-Rice on behalf of Embassy; U.S. Ministers present in\r\nforce....

Our American escort, Mr. Secretary Long, Hugh Gibson of\r\nthe State Department and others provided us with trams and drove\r\nus down to the Rapids, then back to the Falls, from the American\r\nside. In size, beauty and volume of water they came fully up to my\r\nexpectations: it is a strange sensation to stand, as it were, on\r\nthe edge of the world and see a gigantic lake pouring over within\r\na foot of where you stand. The spray rises in a snow-white cloud\r\nas high again as the length of the falls, and it is impossible to\r\npenetrate it to the other side. Our American escort then turned\r\nus out of the cars, which the leading citizens of Niagara had\r\nthoughtfully provided, and restored us to our tram, in which we\r\nproceeded half-way across the bridge. There we took an affecting\r\nfarewell, and, as the Americans left by one door, the Canadian\r\nescort, composed chiefly of lieutenant-governors and custodians\r\nof the Niagara property, entered by the other. We were then shewn\r\nthe Canadian side of the Horse Shoe fall, conducted over the power\r\nstation which supplies Toronto and driven out to the Canadian side\r\nof the Rapids and the Whirlpool. There is an aerial car running on\r\ncables over the Whirlpool (at a sickening height, say the timid)\r\nand almost all of us, myself included, were induced to risk our\r\nlives on the principle that where the Secretary of State leads the\r\nrest of the mission follows...._\r\n\r\n_At Toronto, I was told off to help lieutenant-governor's\r\nsecretary; so sorted procession into carriages, jumped into private\r\ncar and drove ahead of the band's sound and fury to Parliament\r\nBuildings, where I got in touch with a cable office, thanked Sir R.\r\nBorden in suitable terms for his telegram of welcome and strolled\r\nout to front, where, as on scaffold, Secretary of State was being\r\nsubjected to native eloquence of mayors, lieutenant-governors et\r\nillud genus omne. His speech in reply aroused great enthusiasm,\r\nand, after interval for cinematograph men to ply their task, party\r\nmoved away from scaffold.... Hurried away to bombard Government\r\nHouse and porter's office for several pieces of missing baggage;\r\n... and drove in haste to Government House for dinner...._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mission went from Toronto to Ottawa, thence to Montreal and\r\nHalifax.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Saturday, May 26th._\r\n\r\n_Nine hot, dusty hours wherein I was almost too tired to smoke or\r\nlook out of window; general coma.... Peterson met me at Montreal\r\nStation at 6.35 p.m., and we drove to his house. Sir William[42] is\r\nat present in nursing-home, so we have place to ourselves. Heaven\r\nbe thanked for the peace and quiet of it! No elevators, no bands at\r\nmeals, no Middle-West-Congressman's wife being \"paged\" throughout\r\nthe living rooms, no telephone calls, no expectant pressmen,\r\nnothing but simple English food, a silent house, deft female\r\nservants, a comfortable room, a warm bed, a spring-mattress and, in\r\ngeneral, the conditions necessary to the mental peace of one whose\r\nnerves are rather quickly breaking up under the strain of the last\r\nsix weeks._\r\n\r\n_After a tête-à-tête dinner, Peterson and I walked round to the\r\nMount Royal Club.... The rest of the mission is timed to leave\r\nToronto this evening for Ottawa, where we are due to join it in\r\nthree days' time; as, since the Parliament Buildings were burnt\r\ndown, there is nothing much to see or do in Ottawa, and, as the\r\nmission is expected in Montreal on its way home, unless the\r\nanti-conscription riots become unduly intense, it would be highly\r\nsatisfactory if we could arrange to join forces here instead of\r\ntoiling back to Ottawa and from Ottawa to Montreal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Monday, May 28th._\r\n\r\n_Awaiting telegraphic reply from Dormer to our request for leave\r\nto stay in Montreal until the mission picks us up here on its\r\nhomeward journey.

Unfortunately for General Bridges, Governor of Bank\r\nof England and other noted anglers, the salmon have not yet come up\r\nthe river; the rest of us, however, availed ourselves of fishing\r\nclub-house and sat in verandah reading and smoking for portion of\r\nmorning. In afternoon walked for several miles. No better place\r\ncould have been chosen for our 16 hours' delay. Two rivers join\r\nhere and flow down at rapid pace, bearing ceaseless burden of rough\r\nlumber, cut and marked miles nearer source and floated down to\r\ndepot where it is collected.

As a troopship we are restricted in liberty\r\nand comfort to some extent. Shrill bugles have exasperating knack\r\nof blowing a reveillé at 5.0 a.m. and repeating same at half-hour\r\nintervals; troops assemble on deck for physical drill, and between\r\nparades there is never any room to walk anywhere. As a set-off, we\r\nhave a tolerable military band, now, alas, temporarily hushed to\r\nmake room for fog-horn as we steam slowly through the mists of the\r\nNewfoundland Banks._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Monday, June 4th._\r\n\r\n_The day promised to be so lacking in incident that a solicitous\r\nmanagement arranged an impromptu submarine scare. As we sat over\r\nour afternoon coffee and cigars, a bugle sounded a call unknown to\r\nme, but evidently familiar to every officer in the smoking-room,\r\nwho took up his position in the \"Birkenhead\" manner on deck with\r\nhis men. Within a few seconds bugles were calling all over the\r\nship, one call after another, and every door and companion-way was\r\nfilled with troops racing to their places. With a view to avoiding\r\ncrowded promenade deck I sauntered on to boat deck, which by happy\r\ncoincidence chanced to be the station accorded to the mission. As\r\nsoon as the tumult and the shouting had died, we returned to our\r\nformer places and avocations, and I was gratified to see that in\r\nthe disorder I had got rid of a very uncomfortable life-belt in\r\nfavour of one both more comfortable and more becoming._\r\n\r\n  _Tuesday, June 5th._\r\n\r\n_The climate has grown trying, as we run in and out of the Gulf\r\nStream, alternating tolerable cold with moist heat.

The military police march up and down, treading with\r\nheavy foot on any who carry life-belts instead of wearing them;\r\narmed sentries also stand by every life-boat to the end that, when\r\nthe deadly torpedo has done its work and our ship's complement\r\nof 7,000 is tossing about in life-boats and on rafts, there\r\nshall be attached to each party at least one man with a rifle,\r\nmaking life unpleasant to the submarine crew, if any question\r\nof machine-gunning the survivors arise.... As a compliment to\r\nthe United States Navy, the convoy was made up of two American\r\ndestroyers, subsequently increased to four. In the evening, by\r\nurgent request, the Secretary of State addressed the officers of\r\nthe various Canadian regiments in the saloon. There followed a\r\nconcert, principally contributed by Madame Edvina, whom we have\r\nthe honour of carrying this trip.... Having discovered a native\r\naptitude for the game of chess, I left the concert to take care of\r\nitself and competed with Judge Amos.[44]_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Friday, June 8th._\r\n\r\n_Escorted by a varying number of U.S. destroyers, we slipped by\r\neight submarines, and by the end of dinner were in sight of the\r\nIrish and Welsh coasts.

At what else should I look?'\r\n\r\n And He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman,\r\n and said to her, 'Is there no other way in which to walk save the\r\n way of sin?'\r\n\r\n And the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed and\r\n said, 'But you forgave me my sins, and the way is a pleasant\r\n way....'\r\n\r\n And when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by the\r\n roadside a young man who was weeping.\r\n\r\n And He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and\r\n said to him, 'Why are you weeping?'\r\n\r\n And the young man looked up and recognised Him and made answer,\r\n 'But I was dead once and you raised me from the dead. What else\r\n should I do but weep?'\"\r\n\r\n                                  OSCAR WILDE: _The Doer of Good_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nLondon during the second half of 1917 differed from London during\r\nthe late months of 1916 in that, so soon as the United States\r\nabandoned neutrality, the Allies were assured of victory unless\r\nthe German submarine fleet obtained the mastery of the Atlantic\r\nand prevented troops and food from reaching Europe or unless the\r\nGerman army, no longer menaced on the eastern frontier since the\r\nRussian Revolution, could break through on the west and capture\r\nParis or the channel ports. The second course was tried in March,\r\n1918, the first never ceased to be tried until the armistice; but,\r\nwhereas in the winter of 1916-17 there was widespread doubt in\r\nEngland whether the war could end otherwise than in a stalemate,\r\nfrom the middle of 1917 it was evident that the war could and would\r\nbe fought to a finish and that the ultimate military decision lay\r\nwith the inexhausted and inexhaustible armies of the west.\r\n\r\nIt was to Washington, therefore, that the centre of interest now\r\nshifted; and those who had lately returned from America were\r\nbombarded with enquiries about the feeling and condition of the\r\nUnited States. The corporate life of the Balfour mission came to\r\nan end with the welcome accorded to its head at the Guildhall and\r\nat the Mansion House luncheon on July 13th; and, when its members\r\nhad reported their return to their departments, they were free to\r\nstudy the psychology of London in what, even then, was known to be\r\nthe last phase of the war. Since 1914 they had been too busy to\r\ncatch more than a passing glimpse of their friends as they flashed\r\nto and from the front or from their work at home; and the novels\r\nand memoirs of this period will be an untrustworthy guide to future\r\nsocial historians in so far as they suggest a life of unrelieved\r\nfrivolity and pleasure-seeking when the greatest war effort had\r\nyet to be made. There were certainly days and nights of epidemic\r\nexcitement, which occasionally turned to sporadic insanity; now,\r\nas in every phase of the war, there were men and women who made of\r\nthe public disorganisation an excuse for abandoning all recognised\r\nrestraints; but the general change was little more than a universal\r\nrestlessness in which the nerves that had been kept tense by\r\nthe daily demands of the war refused to be relaxed in hours of\r\nleisure. If there were more distractions in 1917 than in 1915,\r\nthere was also more work done, and it was better organised; the\r\nnovels and memoirs, naturally enough, give little space to daily\r\nroutine; but it is less true to suggest that those who lived in\r\nLondon were grown indolent or callous to the war than that they had\r\naccommodated their private lives to public requirements. No one was\r\nsurprised if a man went from his office to dinner without dressing\r\nor if he was made late for luncheon by a daylight air-raid.\r\nInformality, first imposed by necessity, was found to be amusing in\r\nitself; and an element of impromptu picnic crept into most of the\r\nparties of that time.\r\n\r\nThis deliberate attempt to preserve as much of the old life and\r\ninterests as the war would allow was in part a self-imposed\r\ndiscipline and a refusal to be stampeded; in part it was an effort\r\nto make London tolerable for those who were on leave from their\r\nservice abroad and at home; and in part it was an instinctive\r\nstruggle to retain something familiar in an unfamiliar world and to\r\nrefresh the brain with a diversion in which war had no share. The\r\nyears from 1915 to 1919 saw a prodigious output of new literature\r\nand music; and, if it is still too early to judge of its quality,\r\nthere can be no question about the intellectual stimulus which it\r\nsupplied. Every kind of book was read and discussed; every new\r\nschool of painting had its followers; and love of music, ceasing\r\nto be the foible of the few, became the craving of the many.\r\nThough not yet conspicuously prompt in payment, the gratitude\r\nof thousands is due to the devotion of Sir Thomas Beecham and of\r\nhis supporters for the opera which they maintained at Drury Lane\r\nwith untiring enterprise and energy; without their labours, Covent\r\nGarden would be as dead as the London Opera House; no opera in\r\nEnglish would ever get a hearing; and in 1917 and 1918 London would\r\nnot have had its mixed programme of English, Russian, French,\r\nItalian and German opera.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEarly in 1918 came the black days of the last German offensive.\r\nAll the optimism and relief of 1917 evaporated before the quick,\r\nmerciless rain of blows that battered Amiens and threatened Calais,\r\nshattered Rheims and overhung Paris. In the southwesterly onrush of\r\n1914 the French declared that, if Paris fell, they would transfer\r\ntheir seat of government to Bordeaux (as they did) and, if need\r\nbe, to the foot-hills of the Pyrenees; in 1918 any defeat was\r\ntemporary, for in time the new American levies must burst by sheer\r\nweight of metal through any army that had been carded down by four\r\nyears of fighting; but by 1918 many were asking themselves whether\r\nthe French spirit would still be equal to this last desperate\r\nresolution, whether the British could carry on with a spear-head\r\nthrough their line at Amiens and whether the Americans would make\r\nheadway in a country as completely overrun as Belgium had been.\r\n\r\nTo civilians, the crisis of March 1918 arose suddenly; they may be\r\nthankful that it ended no less suddenly, but the results of the\r\ncrisis outlived the crisis itself. In so far as it is true to say\r\nthat the English ever lost their heads, they lost them between the\r\nMarch offensive and the December general election of 1918. For more\r\nthan four years there had been the relaxation of bonds which is\r\nnatural when life is no longer secure: sexual relationships became\r\nincreasingly promiscuous, marriages were contracted, abandoned\r\nand dissolved with reckless disregard of private morals or public\r\nresponsibility; and the craving for such excitement as would bring\r\nforgetfulness led to the excessive indulgence of every physical\r\nappetite. While this relaxation continued at a steadily increasing\r\npace, it was only in the final months of the war that the loss of\r\nself-control became inconsistent with a balanced mind. The sordid\r\nscandals of this last phase, born of intemperance in drink or drugs\r\nand stimulated to their climax by undisciplined passions, were\r\noccasionally dragged to light in a police-court or at a coroner's\r\ninquest; but in degeneracy, as in crime, it is usually the\r\ninexpert who is detected, and any one who lived in London during\r\nthose feverish months had forced upon his notice a spectacle of\r\ndebauchery which would have swelled the record of scandal if it had\r\nbeen made public but which is mercifully forgotten because it was\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nThis is neither the place nor time to pass a judgement on it;\r\nand perhaps it does not deserve to be too strictly condemned. In\r\nthreatening all and in fulfilling with many the unexpected fate\r\nof material ruin, physical mutilation and premature death, a war\r\nwhich strikes at the normal security of life must be accepted\r\nwith abnormal resignation or resisted with abnormal resolution.\r\nAs the instinct of self-preservation, rising sublime into pride,\r\nsinking into base fear and ranging through every spiritual state\r\nbetween these extremes, automatically precludes the alternative\r\nof surrender, the abnormal resistance has to be fortified by an\r\nabnormal appeal to primitive reserves of endurance and courage\r\nwhich modern man, inheriting from his earliest ancestors, keeps\r\nstored for rare moments of emergency. The bodily and mental\r\ntortures of an unanticipated catastrophe, be it war, earthquake,\r\nshipwreck or fire, are only made supportable by the aid of\r\nqualities so primitive as to be extraneous to the character of\r\ncivilised man; and, as it would be unreasonable to expect that\r\nhe should be able to unbar an ancient door and to release one\r\npotent force while keeping all others enchained, the additional\r\nfortitude by means of which the war was borne at least with general\r\ndignity had to be accompanied by the accession of qualities less\r\nconventionally admirable.\r\n\r\nIn short phrase, the restraints of modern civilisation were\r\nburst on the resurgence of primitive man. Honourable, kindly,\r\nfastidious, gentle and reserved spirits, dragged back across the\r\nages, lied and cheated, fought and bullied in an orgy of intrigue\r\nand self-seeking, of intoxication and madness. Only in this way\r\nand at this price could those who had fared delicately and lived\r\nsoftly endure hardships which for generations or centuries had been\r\nremoved from the average experience of civilisation; the bravery\r\nof the savage emerged hand in hand with the savage's ferocity, his\r\nlicence, his superstition and his credulity.\r\n\r\nWhile time and tranquillity are needed before these unruly forces\r\ncan be finally subdued, the panic rush of mob-madness passed\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nWith the second battle of the Marne even a civilian knew that it\r\nwas a matter of months or weeks before the Germans capitulated.\r\nCasualties would still be recorded; agony would be endured,\r\nuncertainty would continue; there might be a final berserk outburst\r\non sea and land, but ultimately the German government would sue\r\nfor peace. No one was surprised when the \"fourteen points\" were\r\nflashed on the sky from Washington; no one was surprised when the\r\nGermans saw in the west the grey, hopeless light which was yet the\r\nonly light that they could ever hope to see. Capitulations poured\r\nin until some of the onlookers, in the spirit of Horace Walpole,\r\nsearched eagerly through their papers of a morning to see which new\r\nenemy had surrendered.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when the maroons burst the stillness of London at the\r\neleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, all\r\nwere surprised; not by the fact of peace but by the imponderable\r\nsignificance of peace. Did this ear-splitting salvo mean one last\r\nraid by every aeroplane in the German fleet, an _auto-da-fé_\r\nwhich should at least achieve that, when peace was negotiated, it\r\nwould be elsewhere than in the smoking, brain-splashed ruins of a\r\nshattered London? In late afterthought, with an air of discovery\r\nand a dread of revealing emotion, every one decided that the\r\nGermans must have accepted the armistice terms.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the government departments were belched forth on\r\nholiday. Along the Processional Avenue moved slowly a double line\r\nof cars and taxis, packed inside and out and above with atoms of\r\na vast concourse infected by a lust for moving from any one place\r\nto any other. Beyond this, no one knew what to do. The king had\r\nalready spoken from a window of Buckingham Palace. Superficially\r\nit was all a little boring; and, below the deliberately suave,\r\nunemotional surface, all knew that the day was so tremendous that\r\nnone dared look at it yet. A child-typist from a Government-office\r\nhut rushed into the Mall, white-faced, bareheaded and delirious.\r\n\"The war's over! Now daddy'll come home!\" By her side a woman\r\nwinced and looked, groping after sympathy, for someone who, like\r\nherself, knew that the armistice had come too late. Throughout the\r\nworld there were houses in which the glory of peace would be turned\r\nto mourning by news of a son who had been killed in the last few\r\nhours of fighting: the roll of honour is not yet complete; and,\r\nmore than two years after the armistice, there are still men in the\r\nblue jackets and trousers of their hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith the armistice another chapter would seem to open; but, in\r\nspite of the tangible fact of victory which should have divided all\r\nthat came before from all that came after, the abrupt transition\r\nto peace was effected in the psychological atmosphere produced by\r\nthe last months of war. Had this not been so, there would have\r\nbeen no purpose in making more than a passing reference to the\r\nwar insanity which followed the dread and despair of the March\r\noffensive; unhappily for the peace of the world and for all hopes\r\nof a universal spirit, the Versailles conference was inspired\r\nby frenzied memories of the mad election of December 1918 and\r\nthe mad election translated into actuality and crystallised that\r\nmood of madness whereof a mental pathologist would have said that\r\nepidemic hysteria was abroad, others--in the words of an old\r\nchronicler--that \"Christ and His angels slept.\"\r\n\r\nPublic degradation in England has scored many good totals; in the\r\nvulgar abuse showered upon O'Connell, in the salacious persecution\r\nof Stead, in periodic waves of insensate arrogance, cruelty,\r\nignorance and injustice; the English have had their South African\r\nwar, their yellow labour and their persecution of conscientious\r\nobjectors to remind the world that, whatever their pretensions,\r\nthey are still human. The personal experience of the oldest and\r\nthe historical reading of the most erudite would have difficulty\r\nin finding a greater collective degradation than was reached in\r\nthe public attitude, during the last months of the war, to what is\r\nknown as the \"Pemberton-Billing case.\"\r\n\r\nThe slightest reference may unprison the foul gases of that trial;\r\nit is best to regard it as the necessary result of a nervous\r\nand physical strain too great to be borne. Day after day, in\r\nan English court of law, before a British jury and the senior\r\njudge of the King's Bench Division there was recited a tale of\r\nintrigue and debauchery from which the librettist of a melodrama\r\nwould have turned away in unbelief and the alienist in disgust.\r\nHonoured names were introduced as pegs for the charge of treason\r\nand sexual perversion; the educational influence of the press was\r\nexerted to secure that a hundred thousand villages should be made\r\nacquainted with the bewildering nomenclature of infamous vices.\r\nWhen the original newspaper charges were met with a countercharge\r\nof criminal libel, the direction of the judge and the intelligence\r\nof a British jury resulted in a verdict of \"Not Guilty.\" And there\r\nwas cheering in court and in the street. And some people believed\r\nthat, as the prisoner had been acquitted, the charges must be true.\r\nAfter three years we can look back on judge and jury, prisoner\r\nand public with less disgust than pity; to the psychologist the\r\nPemberton-Billing trial is a reminder that he must be on his guard\r\nwhenever he hears stereotyped phrases about the political instinct,\r\nthe justice and sanity, still more the chivalry of the English. Not\r\neven as a political manœuvre was it successful.\r\n\r\nThe \"low intelligence and high credulity\"[45] of a public which,\r\nperiodically and in the last resort, is entrusted with an imperial\r\nmission among several hundred millions of people may be measured\r\nby the belief accorded to a single allegation. In the course of\r\nthe trial frequent reference was made to a \"black book,\" then\r\nromantically entrusted to the blackmailing custody of Prince\r\nWilhelm of Wied, in which were recorded the names of at least\r\n47,000 people who occupied some prominent position in English\r\nsociety and who lay, by reason of their vices, at the mercy of the\r\nfirst enemy who threatened them. Any one whose work has taken him\r\namong books, any one who has had occasion to consult a card-index,\r\nwould know that it requires a bulky catalogue to print, even in\r\n\"brilliant,\" 47,000 names with enough crimesheet to each to ensure\r\nthat its bearer could be hushed or drummed out of public life. The\r\nbook, whatever its size, was filled with matter so confidential\r\nthat, when a taste of its contents was to be offered to an officer\r\nwho was conveniently dead before the case came to trial, it had to\r\nbe carried beyond the reach of spies and eavesdroppers and laid\r\nbare under the sky of the English countryside; there was no room,\r\nthere was no open space in London where its guilty secrets could\r\nbe revealed. The limits of a novelist's daring are more quickly\r\nreached than those of a jury's simple faith.\r\n\r\nThis case, with its startling blend of melodrama and pruriency,\r\nwounded and injured in greater or lesser degree everyone whose\r\nname the learned judge tolerantly allowed to be mentioned. That,\r\nperhaps, was the fortune of law as administered, with all the\r\nresponsibility and decorum attaching to his great office, by Mr.\r\nJustice Darling. What was said really does not matter so much as\r\nthat thousands of people believed it to be true. By this test,\r\nif it were indeed ever needed, a big part of the British public\r\nshewed itself to be as ignorant, suspicious, cruel and base-minded\r\nas any big part of any other public, including that which had\r\npersecuted Dreyfus--to the righteous indignation of the equitable\r\nEnglish. And, though perhaps the ignorance and suspicion, the\r\nbase-mindedness and cruelty were the after-result of fear, from\r\nwhich the Englishman suffers as much as any one else, the public\r\ntemper at the time of the Pemberton-Billing trial--not wholly\r\nunlike the temper of a mob in a southern state when a negro is\r\nbeing lynched--survived when fear had been laid to rest: ignorance\r\nand suspicion, fear, revenge and greed provided the atmosphere of\r\nthe conference in which the statesmen of the world met together to\r\ncontrive a peace which should end war.\r\n\r\nIt was in the power of the prime minister to allay these evil\r\npassions or to stimulate them. With the unbounded prestige that\r\nattaches to the head of any government still in office at the end\r\nof a long war, he could have united all parties in his struggle for\r\na great and durable peace not less certainly than he had united\r\nthem in his prosecution of the war; as they had responded to every\r\ndemand in war, so they would have made every sacrifice for peace;\r\nas he had curbed their impatience and lightened their despondency,\r\nso he could check their greed and set an ideal before their eyes.\r\nMr. Lloyd George saw the light and turned his back upon it. With\r\nall an old demagogue's art in playing on popular passion, he outbid\r\nthe wildest and outdid the most sanguinary: the cry for indemnities\r\nand the howl for revenge were drowned in his own shouted promise\r\nthat England should have her fill of blood and gold if she would\r\nbut return him to power.\r\n\r\nIt is at least arguable that Germany in defeat should have paid\r\nnot less than she would have exacted, in victory, from another\r\npower; one school considers that to leave the ex-Kaiser and his\r\nassociates unpunished is to condone the atrocities for which they\r\nwere responsible and to make these the permissible minimum in\r\nany future war. No armistice terms would be complete unless they\r\nmade provision for bringing the war-criminals to book. Equally,\r\nno armistice terms deserve serious attention if they promise that\r\nwhich their signatories know to be incapable of fulfilment. Mr.\r\nLloyd George's offence against the people of his own and of all\r\nfuture generations lay in his giving pledges which could not be\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nFor this turpitude no excuse can be suggested; and of explanations\r\nthere is none less discreditable than that the old electioneering\r\nhand could not resist its opportunity and that the old mob-orator\r\nplayed instinctively with the known and proved shortness of the\r\npublic memory. The allies were not taken unawares by the idea of\r\nan armistice: for more than four years they had been declaring\r\ntheir war-aims and modifying them in accordance with the shifts\r\nand changes of fortune; their agreement was sealed in successive\r\npacts; the utmost limits of what was possible in monetary\r\npayment and territorial redistribution had been assigned in\r\nthe elaborate memoranda of countless experts; and, though this\r\nwork of preparation was speedily abandoned in the turmoil of the\r\nVersailles conference, it should have controlled the exuberance\r\nof the prime minister's electoral campaign and saved him from the\r\nmore flagrant forms of bad faith. Though he deceived others, he, a\r\nformer chancellor of the exchequer, could not have deceived himself\r\nwith the figures which were proposed as an estimate of German\r\nindemnities; and thirteen years' unbroken tenure of office were\r\nmore than enough to teach a cabinet minister that the asylum which\r\nthe Dutch government was extending to the ex-Kaiser could not be\r\ndisturbed save by an unwarrantable declaration of war.\r\n\r\nAll this could have been explained to the public until the fever\r\nof 1918 had abated. There was no need for a general election, and\r\nno justification has even been attempted; but the opportunity was\r\nirresistible, and the election was conducted on lines calculated to\r\nwipe all opposition out of existence. Coalition conservatives and\r\ncoalition liberals consolidated their alliance by means of a system\r\nwhich offered to candidates the choice of unconditional surrender\r\nand of annihilation; ministers constructed their programme\r\nof peace from the hysterical savagery of their most violent\r\nsupporters; and the government swept the country in triumph. It\r\nwould have made little difference to the result if the independent\r\nliberal opposition had shewn the courage and justice to offer an\r\nalternative programme, though the unseated liberals might have\r\nconsoled themselves with the thought that they had fallen in a\r\nstruggle for honesty and moderation. Against madness so widespread\r\nnot one dared to raise his voice in protest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhether or not electors, who are amateurs in politics, deserve the\r\ngovernment which they get, at least they get the government for\r\nwhich they have asked; however disagreeable, this is a necessary\r\npart of their political education, and they might be left,\r\nphilosophically enough, to reap the wild oats that they have sown\r\nif the harvest of disaster were confined to their own country and\r\nto their own generation. Unhappily, the results of the mad election\r\nare more far-reaching: not only is there no guarantee of peace at\r\nthe end of an unparalleled war, but bad blood has been created\r\nbetween the three powers which, in the absence of an effective\r\nleague of nations, are responsible for even the temporary peace of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe German army, it is sometimes forgotten, ceased fire on\r\naccepting the fourteen points promulgated by President Wilson.\r\nBefore the British would consent to an armistice, they reserved\r\nliberty to alter certain naval provisions; otherwise it was\r\nreasonably well understood that the American formula bound\r\nPresident Wilson's associates and limited their utmost demand. At\r\nthe Versailles conference, as Mr. Maynard Keynes and Mr. Lansing\r\nhave shewn, the President was outwitted and overruled by M.\r\nClemenceau, who stood for a second Brest-Litovsk peace, and by\r\nMr. Lloyd George, who stood for everything in turn and nothing\r\nlong. A cynic observed of the completed treaty: \"Gentlemen, in\r\nthis document we are sowing the seeds of a great and durable war\";\r\nwhatever else may be said of it, no one could easily trace even\r\na faint resemblance to the settlement outlined in the fourteen\r\npoints. It was impossible for the British representatives to\r\nkeep faith at the same time with the president and with their\r\nelectors; the French prime minister was more in sympathy with the\r\nblatant materialism of England than with the intangible idealism\r\nof America; and before long Mr. Wilson was first deserted and then\r\noverborne.\r\n\r\nThough he has since been repudiated by his own people, the\r\ndivergence of opinion at Versailles has grown into a wide and\r\ndangerous antagonism between the peoples of Great Britain and\r\nof America; each feels that it has been betrayed by the other;\r\nand, so long as the antagonism lasts, there can be no cooperation\r\nbetween the two in world-politics. The ill-feeling is more than\r\nthe critical and petulant jealousy which breaks out among allies\r\nat the end of every war: any one might have foretold that France\r\nwould impute to Great Britain a niggardly expenditure of men and\r\nthat Great Britain would resent the price charged by France for the\r\nprivilege of using her railways, occupying her trenches and finally\r\ndriving the invaders from her soil; Great Britain and France have\r\nagreed privately that Italy has received more in proportion to\r\nher sacrifices than any of the allies, that America and Japan\r\nhave feathered their nests and that the very name of Russia is\r\nanathema; and America murmurs that, instead of thanking her for\r\ncoming to their rescue, the western powers of the old world only\r\ncalculated how much of their burden in money and casualties could\r\nbe transferred to the shoulders of the newcomer. There was the same\r\ncarping after the Napoleonic wars and after the wars of Marlborough.\r\n\r\nBetween America and Great Britain the antagonism is deeper-seated\r\nbecause each has lost confidence in the good faith of the other.\r\nWho, cries the one, could trust a nation which threw over its own\r\nrepresentative and shirked its share in the labour of policing\r\nthe world? Who, cries the other, could trust a nation which broke\r\nfaith from the beginning of the war, when it used the plight of\r\nBelgium as an excuse for imperial expansion, until the end, when\r\nit used the American armistice-terms as an excuse for disarming\r\nand despoiling Germany? When once the recriminations begin,\r\nevery old cause of difference is dragged in to support one or\r\nother side; and the vision of a lasting union between the two\r\ngreatest English-speaking peoples fades from sight and even from\r\nimagination. This is the price which the English have to pay--the\r\nprice which they have also made others pay--for the dishonest\r\nelection of 1918.\r\n\r\nAs no protest was heard while the election raged, so, while\r\nthe peace conference was sitting, the only protest against\r\nits activities came in occasional blustering telegrams from\r\nself-important members of parliament who conceived themselves to\r\nbe responsible for keeping the prime minister up to the mark. The\r\ngreat, unpolitical mass of the English people was addressing itself\r\nto the new upheaval of demobilisation, to the prospect of hard-won\r\nidleness and, more remotely, to the problems of reconstruction; the\r\nprofessional politicians were more concerned with personalities\r\nthan with principles; and the centre of gravity shifted in 1919\r\nto Paris. Of the great restless army of women who believe that\r\nthey influence domestic and foreign policy all who could secure\r\na passport and a ticket hurried abroad, there to compete with\r\nthe cosmopolitan army whose life is an imperceptible gliding\r\nfrom Ritz to Ritz in waiting with loaded dinner-tables on the\r\nfringe of the conference. One staked out a claim on one hotel and\r\nstatesman, another on another; London, on their return, was filled\r\nwith stories of their _protégés_ and listened patiently to what\r\nColonel House or \"Clemmy\" had said to each and, less patiently,\r\nto what each had said to Mr. Balfour or to President Wilson; all\r\nwho remembered how the Germans had striven to divide the allies\r\nduring the war kept a vague look-out for attempts to sow dissension\r\nbetween them in the making of peace and were vaguely comforted by\r\neach new proof of solidarity among the high contracting parties. In\r\nquestions of detail it was agreed that there must be differences\r\nof opinion; but, so long as a rupture was avoided, the principles\r\nof peace were left to take care of themselves. President Wilson\r\nmight indeed, with a Disraelian gesture, order his ship to get\r\nup steam; but, as he remained at the last moment to see one or\r\ntwo more of his cardinal points rejected by the British and the\r\nFrench, it was assumed that they were impracticable. The treaty\r\nwas signed on July 19th, and it was not until Mr. Maynard Keynes'\r\n_Economic Consequences of the Peace_ had been digested that the\r\npolitical army and the camp-followers ceased gossiping about the\r\npersonalities of the conference and turned their attention to the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThey then discovered that their representatives had imposed on\r\nGermany terms which could not be fulfilled and which the fourteen\r\npoints gave them no right to impose; the league of nations was\r\nleft as a nebulous aspiration; and the pacific future of the world\r\nwas based on the twin hope that the central powers were now bled\r\ntoo white ever again to rear an aggressive head and that, if they\r\ndid, the association of Great Britain, France and America would\r\nendure to beat it once more into the dust. To the old-fashioned\r\nsystem of secret diplomacy, of defensive and offensive alliances,\r\nof competition in armaments, of exploitation and intrigue and\r\nof \"preventive wars\"--the system which had given birth to the\r\ngreatest war in history--the wisdom of the Versailles conference\r\ncould offer no alternative; the one new idea which it contributed\r\nto international politics was that of sharing with America the\r\nprivilege of suffering again in the future from a system which had\r\nlately brought the whole world to the brink of ruin and dissolution.\r\n\r\nThis privilege the people of the United States declined; and Europe\r\nin 1919 differed chiefly from Europe in 1914 by the eclipse of\r\nRussia on the one side and of Austro-Hungary on the other. The\r\nold system and the old spirit have remained. It does not lie in\r\nthe mouth of those who threw overboard the fourteen points to\r\nreproach those who repudiated the covenant and mandates of the\r\nleague of nations. President Wilson pretended to more power than\r\nhe possessed, and his political opponents took their revenge by\r\ndisowning him; Mr. Lloyd George carried out, so far as he was able,\r\nthe policy of spoliation and punishment which he had promised to\r\nthe electors as the price of their support in the election that\r\ngave him his revenge on his political opponents.\r\n\r\nSo the needless, mad war, fed year after year with the life-blood\r\nof an entire generation, came to an end in a hopeless, mad peace.\r\nIf those who cried loudest in their frenzy of greed and revenge got\r\nthe peace which they deserved, it was not the peace for which one\r\nman, turning his back on the splendid promise of youth, had gone\r\nforth to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDEMOBILISATION\r\n\r\n  _Nelson_: What are you thinking, that you speak no word?\r\n\r\n  _Hardy_: ... Thoughts all confused, my lord:--their needs on deck,\r\n           Your own sad state, and your unrivalled past;\r\n           Mixed up with flashes of old things afar--\r\n           Old childish things at home, down Wessex way,\r\n           In the snug village under Blackdon Hill\r\n           Where I was born. The tumbling stream, the garden,\r\n           The placid look of the grey dial there,\r\n           Marking unconsciously this bloody hour,\r\n           And the red apples on my father's trees,\r\n           Just now full ripe.\r\n\r\n  _Nelson_:                   Ay, thus do little things\r\n            Steal into my mind, too. But, ah my heart\r\n            Knows not your calm philosophy!--There's one--\r\n            Come nearer to me, Hardy,--One of all,\r\n            As you well guess, pervades my memory now;\r\n            She, and my daughter--I speak freely to you.\r\n            'Twas good I made that codicil this morning\r\n            That you and Blackwood witnessed. Now she rests\r\n            Safe on the nation's honour....\r\n\r\n                                      THOMAS HARDY: _The Dynasts_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of the armistice the population of the emergency\r\noffices was sharply divided into those who wished to leave, but\r\nwere required to stay, and those who wished to stay, but were\r\nrequired to leave. Though the raising of the blockade was almost\r\nautomatic, the blockade departments took time to wind up; and the\r\ntemporary officer was not infrequently demobilised several months\r\nbefore the temporary civil servant was released.\r\n\r\nThese days of transition were a time of endless comings and\r\ngoings, of unexpected returns and abrupt departures. Men who were\r\nthought to be dead reappeared suddenly from East and West Africa,\r\nfrom Palestine and India, demanding news of their scattered and\r\ndecimated friends; women who had been lost to view for nearly five\r\nyears emerged from hospitals, offices and factories; and all of\r\na stricken generation who had survived set themselves once more\r\nto make a career or a livelihood. By now they were in age nearer\r\nthirty-five than twenty-five, uprooted and unsettled by the war,\r\nwith greater experience and smaller hope, more resignation and\r\nless resiliency. The time ahead of them was ten years shorter than\r\nwhen they came down from their universities; many had married\r\nand begotten children; they could not long afford to wait; their\r\n\"common problem\" was no longer\r\n\r\n  \"to fancy what were fair in life\r\n  Provided it could be,--but, finding first\r\n  What may be, then find how to make it fair\r\n  Up to\" their \"means; a very different thing!\"\r\n\r\nBy an oversight, excusable enough in hard-driven ministers who\r\ncould not be expected to think of everything, no provision had been\r\nmade by the government to secure that every soldier on leaving\r\nthe army should be at least no worse off than when he joined it,\r\nat the risk of his life, to fight in defence of his country.\r\nMachinery was indeed erected for liberating first in order those\r\nfor whom work was waiting; officers in search of employment were\r\nencouraged to submit themselves and their qualifications to a\r\nhastily constructed labour-exchange; the king and Field-Marshal Sir\r\nDouglas Haig invited all employers of labour to give preference to\r\nex-service men; funds were collected, speeches were made; and, as\r\nit is always impolitic to foster a sense of grievance, even the\r\ngrievance of hunger, in men who have been drilled to shoot and, in\r\nshooting, to hold their own lives cheaply, a system of temporary\r\ndoles was instituted to bridge the interval until industrial\r\nconditions became normal, or, in less pretentious language,\r\nuntil something turned up. Admirable as were these remedies, the\r\ndemobilized officers and men felt that the hands which had waved\r\nthem forth to die were chill of touch when extended in welcome to\r\nthose who had not died after all.\r\n\r\nFor two years the men who were once so deafeningly acclaimed as\r\nheroes that, for their own protection, less heroic but still\r\nappreciative patriots were forbidden to stand them drink have\r\nbeen advertising daily for any work that will keep them fed; in\r\ntimes of trade depression they have marched through the streets of\r\nLondon under banners inscribed with the device \"WANTED IN 1914: NOT\r\nWANTED NOW\"; and the passers-by feel that it is very sad (though,\r\nto be sure, some of these mendicants are impostors; and, of the\r\nunemployed, some are always unemployable), but that, if anything\r\ncould be done, it would have been done long ago. While it would be\r\nfoolish to minimise the difficulties of employers who are asked\r\nto replace tried men and women with unskilled soldiers, it may be\r\nsubmitted that the government which caused and the society which\r\nsanctioned such an upheaval as the late war are responsible for\r\nrestoring order when war is at an end. If a civilian can within\r\nsix months be turned into a soldier, the soldier can in little\r\nlonger time be turned back into a civilian; as, during his military\r\ntraining, the state maintained him, so it should maintain him while\r\nhe is being trained for civil work; as he was fed and clothed\r\nin camp, so he should be fed and clothed until he is needed in\r\nfield or mine, office or shop. The voluntary organisations and\r\npatriotic appeals are being launched among the descendants of\r\nNelson's countrymen; they have an opportunity of wiping out their\r\ngreat-grandfathers' disgrace. To suggest that the whole community\r\nis responsible for the men who have faced death on its behalf\r\nis to court the terrific imputation of \"socialism\"; yet war is\r\nthe greatest possible socialisation of society, and it is not\r\nunreasonable to propose that public responsibility shall continue\r\nuntil the first dislocation of war has been corrected. By now\r\nhundreds of thousands have been found employment; but, so long as\r\none suffers from want, the whole community is disgraced. The price\r\nof a woman's dress would keep him in affluence for half a year.\r\n\r\nIn the first weeks of demobilisation the problem was more difficult\r\nin that those who needed and wanted work needed and wanted a\r\nholiday first. The best-intentioned efforts to regulate or retard\r\nthe flow of men from the army until there was a sure position for\r\nthem outside it were met with desertion and mutiny till the sluices\r\nwere opened wide and only sufficient troops retained to enforce the\r\nterms of the armistice. The countries which had been devastated by\r\nthe war and those which were threatened with ruinous indemnities\r\nset to work at once to repair the damage and to build up their\r\nresources; England, which had endured as long a strain as any\r\nwithout having iron driven into her soul at the sight of her land\r\nlaid waste or of her industries ruined, settled down to drowsy\r\nrecuperation until the next crisis should rouse her with the threat\r\nof financial disaster, revolution or another war.\r\n\r\nIn those first months of peace there was much talk of\r\n\"reconstruction,\"[46] but the only thing reconstructed at this time\r\nwas one part of the leisured, social life of the country. To some\r\nextent this was inevitable at a time when political interest was\r\ncentred in Versailles and when a new House of Commons, filled with\r\n\"hard-faced men who looked as though they had done well out of the\r\nwar,\" chafed at the long-continued absence of the prime minister\r\nand tinkered with such unimportant legislation as was entrusted\r\nto the control of Mr. Bonar Law. In an atmosphere of suspense and\r\nunreality, the graver issues were postponed; and all energies were\r\nconcentrated on creating a life as similar as possible to that\r\nwhich had been interrupted by the war and one in which the war\r\ncould be forgotten. Foreign and domestic responsibilities, which\r\nin a democratic country are the concern of every adult man and\r\nwoman, were lost to view in the preoccupation of a \"Victory Ball\"\r\nand of the first \"peace Ascot.\" In 1919, for the first time since\r\n1914, there were garden-parties at Buckingham Palace and a gala\r\nnight at Covent Garden; the Derby was run; great balls were given\r\nin historic houses; entertaining and sport reached a perfection and\r\nprofusion only inferior to 1914 standards in the number of those\r\nwho, killed or maimed by four and a half years of war, were unable\r\nto attend. They, were they able to see the \"reconstruction\" of\r\nthe country which they had redeemed and of the people whom they\r\nhad reprieved, would have known at last what they had sacrificed\r\neverything to preserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIf at the first calling of the half-forgotten roll they were unable\r\nto answer to their names, others stepped quickly forward to take\r\ntheir place. In breaking down social barriers, the war continued\r\nand went some distance towards completing a process which had\r\nbeen going on for twenty years. It has already been suggested\r\nthat, in the last decade of Queen Victoria's reign, \"society\"\r\nwas a word with at least a fairly definite negative connotation:\r\ncertain acts or qualities expelled a man from it; certain other\r\nqualities were needed to admit him to an intimate and interrelated\r\ncommunity of a few hundred men and women who drew their prestige\r\nfrom land, basked in the sunshine of the court, supplied drafts\r\nfor the diplomatic service, the foreign office, the brigade of\r\nguards, the household cavalry and a chosen few other units and\r\nfelt neither need nor desire to know any one outside their own\r\nworld. The first American invasion abolished the pedigree test;\r\nlater, the monied-cosmopolitan invasion abolished every other.\r\nThe close corporation was disbanded; and, though a few hostesses\r\nreceived only their old friends--without their old friends' new\r\nfriends,--the others scattered in search of distraction; and even\r\nbefore the outbreak of war the two essentials in almost every\r\ngathering were that wealth should secure the generous minimum\r\nof comfort and that brains or eccentricity should provide the\r\namusement. If in 1890 social success could be roughly appraised\r\nby the number of people that a man did not know, in 1920 it was\r\nmeasured by his industry and skill in getting to know everybody:\r\naristocratic London and artistic London, diplomatic London and\r\npolitical London, financial London and theatrical London have all\r\noverflowed their old boundaries and now meet in the undefined vast\r\npool of London.\r\n\r\nTo dwellers in other capitals that is London's distinguishing mark;\r\nto many it is, within limits, London's greatest charm: the city\r\nis big enough to find room for every one, and each may lead his\r\nown life among his own friends. The _rastaquouère_ is not penned\r\nwithin his own fold, as in Paris, nor the actress in hers, as in\r\nNew York; soldier and civilian meet on an equality that would amaze\r\nBerlin; Jew and gentile, pre-Conquest family and new rich in a\r\nway which Vienna would not tolerate. Diplomats in London have no\r\ncorporate life of their own; ambassadors and _attachés_ scatter and\r\nlose themselves in a more numerous community; lawyers, merchants,\r\npoliticians and newspaper-proprietors are everywhere. Above the\r\nsuper-tax limit London is wholly democratic: those few houses which\r\nstruggled to exclude all but their owners' friends are one by one\r\nbeing sold or closed; a grave scandal is required to bar the road\r\nto court; a title is still to be had without any \"damned nonsense\r\nof merit.\"\r\n\r\nAs society has been diluted, its political power has evaporated.\r\nFor some years yet the old charm will indeed work fitfully in\r\na country so well trained to the exercise of \"influence\"; but,\r\noutside the sphere of recommendations and minor appointments, the\r\naspirant to office will now carry to Fleet Street the ambitions\r\nwhich in former years he laid on the doorsteps of Downing Street;\r\nwhen every woman is a \"political hostess,\" the most hardened\r\nwire-puller must feel that she does not change the course of\r\nhistory by inviting a labour member to luncheon; the game has\r\nbecome so easy that all can compete without training or practice.\r\nPolitics were finally desocialised when Mr. Asquith moved to\r\nCavendish Square; they were commercialized and put on a business\r\nfooting when Mr. Lloyd George took his place. No longer, as in\r\nthe novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward and in the plays of Oscar Wilde,\r\ndo high-born undersecretaries and omniscient editors chaffer away\r\nstate secrets to sinister millionaires and seductive adventuresses\r\nat a glittering reception in the townhouse of a cultured duke; it\r\nmay be doubted if they ever did. Nowadays, politics and the press\r\nmeet over a hospitable breakfast-cup of coffee in a minister's\r\nhouse or engage in a friendly round of golf, with the minister's\r\npress-secretary ever at hand to carry the clubs and to dart back\r\nwith telephone-messages; at night all take their places at the\r\ntable of some untiring woman to whom society means the collection,\r\nunder one roof, of the greatest number of most incongruous guests.\r\n\r\nThe war lent a powerful impulse to this promiscuity. The old\r\nentertaining was perforce suspended; but London still contained\r\nseveral hundred men and women who were bitten with a craving to\r\nmeet the celebrity of the hour; and war is prolific of celebrities.\r\nEvery day threw up on the patient shores of England the man who\r\nhad invented the new collapsible machine-gun, the man who had\r\ndropped bombs on Bagdad, the man who knew President Wilson's real\r\nfeelings, the man whose slim volume of war-sonnets had convulsed\r\nthe tea-tables of Chelsea. Night after night, they were to be met\r\nat dinner; as their eyes lost the early dazed look, they became\r\nmen with a message; later, as their message, whether on Bagdad or\r\nthe White House, became crisply stereotyped, they faded to the back\r\nof the room and made way for some one yet more arresting.[47] Had\r\nthe heroes of the hour passed like lions in an itinerant menagerie,\r\nthere would have been no congestion; but, inside the theatre and\r\nout, London is loyal to its old favourites.\r\n\r\nThus, by the beginning of the first season after the war, London\r\nhad so far completed its gradual transformation that its numbers\r\nwere wholly unmanageable; and, though timid efforts were made\r\nto dislodge the tentacles of war friendships, it was easier to\r\nbreak down a barrier than to build one up. The former rulers had\r\ndeliberately abdicated; and, though a man has only himself to\r\nblame for admitting to his house any one of whom he disapproves,\r\nnowadays he cannot help meeting in the houses of others many\r\nwho would not have been tolerated in the stricter days of his\r\nyouth. The degeneration of society is to be reckoned less by its\r\npromiscuity than by its abrogation of all moral standards. It is\r\nstill true, presumably, that, in a country as much addicted as\r\nEngland to bridge, those who are caught cheating at cards will not\r\nbe received, though toleration is extended to those who do not pay\r\ntheir card-losses; for any other offence there is no such thing\r\nas what used to be called \"being turned out of decent society\":\r\nif one door is closed in a man's face, he has only to go to the\r\nnext; the enclosure at Ascot may know him no more, but he will be\r\nin excellent company outside. No longer is there a social taboo\r\nfor the corrupt politician, the fraudulent financier, the habitual\r\ndrunkard, the sexual pervert and the professional correspondent; to\r\nwish for one marks the critic as \"old-fashioned\" or \"provincial\";\r\nand, in an age of universal toleration, these are the two moral\r\nkinks for which there is no forgiveness. The mad orgy which broke\r\nout in 1918 seems, indeed, to have spent itself; but it came to a\r\nnatural end and was not cut short by the influence or opinion of\r\nany individual or group; no one has the power, perhaps no one has\r\nthe desire to set and to insist on a standard of seemly conduct.\r\n\r\nA drawback more serious in the eyes of those who think that life\r\nshould go with a swing is that the democratisation of society tends\r\nto suppress all individuality. There is probably as much wit,\r\ncharm and wisdom in London to-day as at any time, but over the new\r\nvast area it is spread so thin that it is almost imperceptible.\r\nThe strident egotism and resounding, inverted platitudes with\r\nwhich Oscar Wilde once held dinner-tables in marvelling subjection\r\nwould now be drowned in the more strident babel of _cliché_\r\npatter and the stolen humour of public comedians. The intelligent\r\nforeigner, revisiting London after twenty years, would find\r\ndifficulty in discovering the new great hostesses, the new great\r\nconversationalists, the wits, the beauties, even the eccentrics.\r\nThe most famous Duchess of Devonshire is dead; Stafford House is\r\na museum; where are the new stars shining? Who are the successors\r\nto the \"Souls\"? Among the authors and statesmen, the artists and\r\nactors, the soldiers and musicians, the journalists and financiers\r\nof the day there is abundant wisdom and wit, their women are\r\nsometimes radiantly beautiful; but it would be difficult to name\r\nmore than six of the younger generation whose force of personality\r\nor strength of lung could prevail over the clatter of a society\r\nwherein a machine-gun-fire of colloquialisms, Robeyisms and the\r\nsigns and countersigns of an exotic group do duty for intellect.\r\nNot until society has subdivided into manageable groups will a\r\nsingle weak human voice be able to make itself heard; and, until it\r\nis less blatantly vulgar, it would be surprising if a voice worth\r\nhearing cared to try.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAfter five years of food-shortage and servant-problems, the\r\ncountry-houses were, in 1919, beginning to open their doors.\r\nEverywhere the first year of peace was one of interlude and\r\nexperiment; as the war was being wound up and the war-machine\r\ndismantled, thousands of officers, hundreds of thousands of men\r\nwere being demobilised; the government-offices, the factories and\r\nhospitals were pouring forth their supernumeraries; every one\r\nexplored cautiously to see how far the old life could be resumed;\r\nno one could forecast the condition of public finance, wages,\r\nprices or labour a twelve-month ahead nor predict whether he would\r\nbe able to keep his house open in a year's time.\r\n\r\nFortunate, in those days, were the few to whom demobilisation meant\r\nleisure to continue long-interrupted work; more fortunate the yet\r\nsmaller company of those who were financially independent of the\r\nnecessity to join in the hunt for paid appointments. The doctrine\r\nthat a man's best work is done at the spurring of poverty has lost\r\nits former popularity: those to whom creation is a fiercely urgent\r\nneed will express themselves in sickness and in health, at leisure\r\nand in the brief intervals of annihilating labour, when they have\r\nto beg for food and to borrow for ink and paper; those who are\r\nenervated by comfort and made slothful by luxury have not been\r\nimpelled by love of creation for its own sake but by creation as a\r\nmeans to soft living and easy applause. The true artist works in\r\nspite of himself, the quality of his work is conditioned not by the\r\npublic market but by his private conscience; and poverty is not so\r\nmuch a spur to his spiritual ambition as a thorn in his material\r\nflesh, distracting his mind with squalid cares when he would fain\r\nkeep it serene and tempting him to youthful prostitution that\r\nhe may later have the means of living in virtue. \"Pot-boiling,\"\r\nwriting to order and self-advertising are more commonly the fruit\r\nof poverty than is the accomplishment of a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFor even the most conscientious, some degree of independence is\r\nessential for the free development and play of their genius. Not\r\nonly must they be secured freedom from interruption and from\r\ncompeting demands on their energy, but they must enjoy full liberty\r\nto work as they choose without regarding the blandishments of\r\npublishers or the exhortations of critics: the one would restrict\r\nthem to working a single rich vein until it was exhausted, the\r\nother would lop or lengthen them until they fitted the Procrustean\r\nbed of the day's fashion. Rightly or wrongly, the creative artist\r\nclaims to choose his own theme and to treat it in his own way;\r\nsooner or later the veering standards of criticism will concentrate\r\nupon him a massed attack to resist which he needs the fortitude of\r\nindependence. At one moment the long novel, pardoned in Dickens,\r\nis condemned in De Morgan; at another the novel-sequence, praised\r\nin Balzac, is deplored in Compton Mackenzie; at another, again,\r\nthe social and political world which Thackeray and Disraeli painted\r\nis put out of bounds for Galsworthy. In some years the drab life\r\nof grey skies and mean streets is commended as the novelist's\r\nsingle hope of salvation; in others he is urged to study Conrad\r\nand the Russians, as Prince Florizel advised the young men in holy\r\norders to study Gaboriau. This urgency the novelist withstands\r\nat his peril, for his impenitence is likely to be rebuked with a\r\nmagisterial reminder that the critics have spoken about this sort\r\nof thing before.\r\n\r\nThe happiest moment in the existence of all who live by their pens\r\nmust surely be that in which they attain sufficient independence\r\nof position, temperament or pocket to write without regarding too\r\nmuch the jeremiads of a publisher or the cautioning of a reviewer;\r\nand this happy moment comes earlier and more often into the life\r\nof the novelist to-day than at any time since novels were first\r\nwritten. In spite of enhanced cost for producers and of diminished\r\nincomes for consumers, the prospects of the novel have never been\r\nmore bright; the number of those who before the age of thirty\r\nenjoy an honourable reputation all over the world has never been\r\nhigher; and the deference paid in private to the novelist and in\r\npublic to his opinions has become so great that some may think it\r\nexaggerated and undeserved. The columns of the press lie open to\r\nhim when he wishes to air an opinion of his own subject; and hardly\r\na week passes without bringing him a prepaid telegram in which he\r\nis invited to enrich the common stock of thought on any theme from\r\n\"youth\" to \"the future of the cinematograph industry.\" During the\r\nwar he was the supreme court of appeal in strategy and politics; he\r\nis regarded no less seriously than was the musical-comedy actress\r\nof ten years ago; and, when his books are used as the basis of a\r\nfilm scenario, his name is quite frequently printed in company with\r\nthose of the adapter, the producer and the chief actors.\r\n\r\nThis last is perhaps a chivalrous concession by the victor to\r\none who continues to put up a game fight. As time and money are\r\nlimited, it is probable that, when film dramas have worked through\r\ntheir present ingenuous crudity, they will develop at the expense\r\nof the novel and of the stage; at present they have much progress\r\nto make and, even in their highest imaginable perfection, they will\r\nonly compete with that novel in which every other ingredient is\r\nsubordinated to action. At present they are for many novelists a\r\nsource of unearned increment.\r\n\r\nThough the practice of their craft bring, at least to the more\r\nfortunate of story-tellers, honour, affluence and friendships more\r\nprecious than either, most of them find their richest reward in the\r\nresults of their creative energy. This does not mean the elation\r\nwhich comes to a man when he feels that he can call his work good:\r\nsuch gratification he shares with the painter and the sculptor,\r\nthe poet and the dramatist; nor does it mean the sensation that,\r\nafter working at what he loves best and perhaps winning honour and\r\nriches from it, he is possibly leaving behind him something that\r\nmay endure when the tongue of the statesman is silent and when the\r\nhand of the surgeon is cold; alone in all the world of art, the\r\nnovelist, working in rivalry to the first creator, fashions men and\r\nwomen in whosesoever image he pleases and sets them in a garden of\r\nhis own planning, where with the knowledge of good and evil and\r\nwith the power of life and death he controls their destinies and\r\nmakes the span of their existence long or short. It is impossible\r\nfor a man to love Balzac or Dickens, Thackeray or Stevenson without\r\ntaking up his abode in their company: Paris becomes a city wherein\r\nhe may at any moment encounter Vautrin, Nucingen and Lucien de\r\nRubempré on one night and in one setting of streets and clothes,\r\nPinkerton and Loudon Dodd on another; the infinite spaces of\r\nLondon are star-spangled with the cigar-divan in which the former\r\nprince of Bohemia led his Olympian if sedentary existence, with\r\nthe Goswell Street lodgings from which Mr. Pickwick set out on his\r\njourney to Rochester and with the academy in Chiswick at which\r\nBecky Sharp, already a lost soul, hurled her copy of Dr. Johnson's\r\n\"Dixonary.\" To the novelist of imagination these people and places\r\nare more real than the usurpers whom he finds in their stead.\r\n\r\nMuch more real, however puny the imagination, are the men and\r\nwomen whom he carries so long in the womb of his own fancy. Their\r\nfeatures and their clothes, their speech and their mannerisms, the\r\ngreatness and the meanness of their characters are better known to\r\nhim than is the single thought of a child to its mother. In their\r\ncompany he withdraws from what others would call \"the real world,\"\r\nforgetting alike its general ugliness and its occasional flashes\r\nof startling beauty; when he walks abroad and rubs shoulders with\r\nthe passers-by, he is still in their company, their shadows are\r\nmore potent than the clumsy substances among which he dodges in and\r\nout, their voices ring clear above the drone of traffic and the\r\nbroken mutter of the street. London, if they were born there, is\r\ndifferent from any London that other eyes have seen: an hotel in\r\nPiccadilly, crowded with officers in uniform, is for him the place\r\nwhere before the war the transparent shade of a girl stood at the\r\nfoot of the stairs to receive the guests at her coming-out ball;\r\na shuttered house in Curzon Street, under renovation for a rich\r\nAmerican, is the scene in which an engagement was made or broken\r\noff; Pall Mall is overlaid, as in a palimpsest, with imaginary\r\nclubs; and the narrow, silent streets behind the Abbey are roused\r\nto life by the hoot or jingle of phantom cabs on their way to a\r\npolitical dinner.\r\n\r\nIt is a world complete in all its generations, all its social\r\ngrades. They are born and educated, these dream-children; they\r\nlove and quarrel, marry and separate, make money and lose it, live\r\nand die. Another generation presses upward to take their place;\r\nbut, if, as in life, they are forgotten by the newcomers, they can\r\nnever be forgotten by the parent who gave them life and who lives\r\namong them so continuously that he can shed tears of pity for their\r\nimaginary sorrows, while the \"real world\" of which others speak\r\nbecomes shrouded in twilight unreality.\r\n\r\nAny one who holds that a book--like a picture or a statue--should\r\nbe its own explanation, grows quickly suspicious of introductions\r\nand footnotes; but a defence or even a postulate may be allowed\r\nagainst a school of criticism which threatens the former, late-won\r\nfreedom of artistic choice. If it be granted that a story-teller\r\nmay take what theme he likes, it must be granted also that he may\r\ntell the story of an epoch as freely as of an episode, the story of\r\na class or nation as freely as of an individual; he may select as\r\nhis model _War and Peace_, in which Tolstoi chose for subject the\r\nlife of all Russia under the cloud of the Napoleonic wars; he may\r\ncopy Romain Rolland in describing the intellectual history of two\r\ngenerations; he may bow his knee to Balzac, who with superlative\r\ngenius and daring planned his human comedy to cover no less a\r\nsubject than the whole of French life under the restored Bourbons.\r\nAn English author is entitled, if he have the presumption, to write\r\nin ten or in fifty volumes, each linked to its predecessor, of\r\nthe whole English world as it existed before the war and as the\r\nwar transmuted it; if he make it unreadable, it is his fault; if\r\nno one read it, his misfortune; but, so long as ambition remain\r\nobdurate, he is unlikely to be persuaded into other paths. If he be\r\nindependent of sales, he is beyond the reach of fear; if the world\r\ninto which he withdraws be real to him, he needs no other than\r\nthis, the story-teller's, reward.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe period of demobilisation, that twelve months' interlude between\r\nwar and peace, is a convenient time for pausing to take stock of\r\nEnglish literary and artistic development since the end of 1914.\r\nThe æsthetic lives of those who were born in the eighties fall\r\nnaturally into three divisions; there is first the period in which\r\nthe Indian summer of Victorian literature paled before the new\r\nsuns of the nineties; there is then the period in which a quieter\r\nand more reasoned revolt against the self-imposed limitations of\r\nVictorianism expressed itself in a mood of universal experiment\r\namong writers and of universal receptivity among readers; before\r\nthe second phase had worked to a natural end by discarding novelty\r\nfor its own sake and by choosing among the new forms and methods\r\nthose which yielded the most fruitful results, the third period\r\ncrashed into existence at the impulse of a war which upset all\r\norderly progress.\r\n\r\nIt may not be superfluous to recall the names of at least a\r\nfew of those who occupied the forefront of the stage in 1914.\r\nConrad, after long neglect by all but a tiny _intelligenzia_,\r\nhad lately come into his own; Galsworthy continued to break new\r\nhearts with the exquisite tenderness and beauty of each new\r\nbook; Wells, no less prolific than versatile, was pouring out an\r\nastounding profusion of challenges to religion, official politics,\r\nconventional morals, accepted economics and established education,\r\nwith an occasional glorious lapse into such skylarking as _Boon_\r\nand into such immortal comedy as _Mr. Polly_; Bennett, most expert\r\nof craftsmen, was completing his great series of giant miniatures\r\nand taking an occasional holiday with _The Card_ and _The Regent_.\r\nAt long intervals there came a new volume of Kipling stories, more\r\nrestrained than of old and lacking the early generous fire. Moore\r\nand James had foregone novel-writing for autobiography and the\r\nretouching of their earlier work.\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to make a longer list of men with settled\r\nand deserved reputations who at this time were continuing to\r\nproduce work of first-rate technique and achievement; but in 1914,\r\nas in 1921, the public was less interested in reading catalogues\r\nof names than in looking at the men who had won chief place of\r\nhonour and in asking who would reign in their stead when they were\r\ngone. In a famous article which he contributed before the war to\r\nthe literary supplement of _The Times_, Henry James discussed\r\nthe form of some half-dozen of the younger novelists; and, since\r\nthat date, there has raged without intermission an informal\r\ncompetition to name the winners among the writers of the future.\r\nHow far this usurpation of posterity's prerogative diverts a living\r\nwriter from the unembarrassed prosecution of his work might be\r\nargued at length; some may feel that no critic, breathing the same\r\nintellectual atmosphere, can pass more than ephemeral judgements on\r\nthe writers of his generation; the game continues, however, despite\r\nthe awful example of those who, forty or fifty years ago, tried to\r\nplace the fame of their own contemporaries beyond challenge, and,\r\nif it be regarded as no more than a game in which no finality is\r\npossible, it is a harmless intellectual pastime.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the younger novelists of promise included Compton Mackenzie\r\nand D. H. Lawrence, J. D. Beresford and Hugh Walpole, Gilbert\r\nCannan and W. L. George. The poets received less attention, in\r\npart because there were fewer of them and in part because poetry\r\nwas less read before the war, though Masefield in his narrative\r\npoems enjoyed a greater popularity than had befallen any one since\r\nKipling. The younger dramatists were generally ignored: apart from\r\nHoughton, Brighouse and Knobloch, few had succeeded in making their\r\nnames known; and the stage was the almost unraided preserve of\r\nBarrie and Shaw, Pinero, Barker, Bennett and Maugham, Sutro and\r\nJones, Carton and Chambers.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the war, unexpected and incomprehensible, beggaring\r\nthe resources of language and yet demanding that it should be\r\ndescribed and expressed even as it was felt, urged to write those\r\nwho had not written before and urged those who had written before\r\nto write differently. It is not to be expected that the permanent\r\nliterary fruits of the war will be seen for another ten years in\r\nthe work of the younger and more impressionable writers.[48] Young\r\nauthors of either sex were for the most part engaged in grimmer\r\nbusiness than that of writing; and, alike among old and young,\r\nbalance and perspective are not to be found in a time of dazing\r\nshock, of fierce indignation and of numbing grief; the repose in\r\nwhich great work is planned and executed was shattered by the noise\r\nof war; calm vision was disturbed by the vivid blaze of sudden\r\ncontrasts; and, though inspiration has charged the atmosphere, the\r\nform in which it will materialise has not yet been revealed. The\r\nliterature of the last six years should be regarded as contemporary\r\ndocuments to illuminate the psychology of a war in progress rather\r\nthan as the considered and definite contribution made by the\r\ncreative artists of a generation which had been shaken by war from\r\nthe seating of tradition.\r\n\r\nAmong these contemporary documents many are of the highest\r\nquality.[49] _Mr. Britling Sees It Through_, _Peter Jackson: Cigar\r\nMerchant_, _The Dark Forest_, _The Pretty Lady_, _Saint's Progress_\r\nand _Naval Occasions_ each commemorate, in a way that has not yet\r\nbeen excelled, a phase of experience, an attitude of mind towards\r\nthe war, a mood of hysteria, a changing ethical standard or an\r\nunchanging spirit first interpreted and proclaimed. The authors\r\nof these documents were for the most part well known before the\r\nwar; but the last six years have seen emerging the less familiar\r\nnames of E. M. Delafield and Clemence Dane, Stella Benson and Enid\r\nBagnold, Rebecca West and Dorothy Richardson, Frank Swinnerton,\r\nSt. John Ervine and Eimar O'Duffy. While it is not surprising\r\nthat war should give an unequalled opportunity to women writers,\r\nit is remarkable that in half-a-dozen years six young women of\r\nindividuality so strong and so distinctive should all have made\r\ngood their claim to a place in the sun; it is encouraging for the\r\nfuture free development of the English novel.\r\n\r\nAnd individuality is sorely needed at a time when so many writers\r\nshelter themselves behind an illustrious model or conceal their\r\nnative talent by using eccentric tools. In novel-writing the\r\nworst original is usually more valuable than the best copy; but\r\nthe atmospheric effects of Dostoevski and Conrad, the exhaustive\r\nanalysis of James and the sweeping abruptness of Wells prove too\r\nstrong a fascination for many young writers. Of late, the study of\r\npsycho-analysis has obsessed more than one brain and distorted more\r\nthan one novel. If a criticism may be ventured on the present phase\r\nof novel-writing, it would be that the whole is subordinated to one\r\novergrown part: much is heard of \"the novel of realism,\" \"the novel\r\nof manners,\" \"the novel of atmosphere,\" \"the novel of psychology\";\r\nless of \"the novel of perspective.\" In the hands of the great\r\nmasters, realism and romance, manners and atmosphere, psychology\r\nand discussion had each its allotted place and proportion. It would\r\nhave been as inconceivable for Thackeray to write a \"novel of\r\npsychology\"--so proclaimed--as for Vardon to play a championship\r\nround with a putter. This preoccupation with a single tool has\r\ninjured the story-teller's art to the extent that the younger\r\ngeneration is less concerned than were the great masters with the\r\nbusiness of telling a story.\r\n\r\nIf poetry be the highest form of literary expression and lyrical\r\npoetry the immediate response to the keenest stimulus, it might be\r\nexpected that the war would have effected a rich output of the most\r\nprecious material and that we should not have to wait ten years\r\nwhile the shock of war was absorbed. Although, once again, the\r\njudgement of a contemporary is impotent to predict what posterity\r\nwill or should admire, there is a present test by which the poetry\r\nof the last six years must be regarded as disappointing: though\r\nits technical excellence has seldom been higher and never more\r\nwidely diffused, it has not been assimilated into the thought,\r\nthe language or the life of its own generation. While the novels\r\nof the war were read, discussed and quoted, while a passage from\r\nthis one or that may seem the classic description of an episode\r\nor the flawless expression of a mood, the poems of the war have\r\nseldom caught and held an emotion so inevitably as to pass into the\r\ncurrency of a plain man's daily reflections. Two poems by Rupert\r\nBrooke and one by Masefield fix the mingled anguish, wonder and\r\nelation of the early days when the world was wrenched from the\r\nsecurity of peace; they indeed register a frame of mind as clearly\r\nand finally as did _The Loss of the Birkenhead_ and may become as\r\nmuch a part of the common stock as did _The Charge of the Light\r\nBrigade_. It is difficult to recall another of which the same can\r\nbe said.\r\n\r\nThat modern poetry should remain so obstinately divorced from\r\nmodern sentiment and modern life is the more disappointing in that\r\nit has never enjoyed more generous opportunities of making itself\r\nheard and accepted. Poetry is more read and bought than at any\r\ntime within living memory; its single blossoms, too fragile to\r\nburgeon alone, are gathered into yearly anthologies; it is coaxed\r\nwith prizes and encouraged with unprecedented space in weekly\r\nreviews and monthly magazines; but almost always it fades in the\r\nseason that gave it birth.\r\n\r\nThe fault does not lie wholly at the door of an unappreciative\r\npublic, for, though the English submit with incredible docility to\r\nthe tenth-rate, they welcome the first-rate when they can get it.\r\nWithin the last six years the normal conservatism of the London\r\nstage has been assailed by new writers, new plays and new modes\r\nof production. Drinkwater and St. John Ervine have established\r\nthemselves; the long rule of inanity has been overthrown in places\r\nby _The Lost Leader_ and _Abraham Lincoln_, by _The Skin Game_ and\r\n_John Ferguson_, by _The White-headed Boy_ and by the revival of\r\n_The Beggars' Opera_, all of which reflected as much credit on the\r\naudiences as on the authors.\r\n\r\nGenius works at unexpected times and in unexplained ways: there\r\nis no obvious reason why the last months of the war should have\r\nbeen chosen for an experiment in biography which has upset the\r\nold-fashioned biographer's every standard. Lytton Strachey's\r\n_Eminent Victorians_ occupies a place by itself in the literature\r\nof any period. Its wit and irony, its learning and lightness,\r\nits humour and mischief make of it a unique literary sport; its\r\nappearance at the close of an epoch encourages the hope that, in\r\nthe new epoch, it will be the model for future biography.\r\n\r\nHow, then, should this stock-taking at the end of the war be\r\nsummarised? Among old and young there was much activity; the\r\nformer never fell below their standard, the latter gave promise of\r\na standard not less high. The enthusiasm, the conscientiousness,\r\nthe efficiency and versatility of those who stand in the front rank\r\nof contemporary literature are hopeful portents for the future.\r\nInto the Jellaby and Postlethwaite game of awarding premature\r\nimmortality it is foolish to be drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLITERARY TOTEMS\r\n\r\n  Illa tamen gravior, quae cum discumbere coepit\r\n  laudat Vergilium, periturae ignoscit Elissae,\r\n  committat vates et comparat, inde Maronem\r\n  atque alia parte in trutina suspendit Homerum.\r\n  cedunt grammatici, vincuntur rhetores, omnis\r\n  turba tacet, nec causidicus nec praeco loquetur,\r\n  altera nec mulier. Verborum tanta cadit vis,\r\n  tot pariter pelves ac tintinnabula dicas\r\n  pulsari. Jam nemo tubas, nemo aera fatiget;\r\n  una laboranti poterit succerrere Lunae.\r\n  imponit finem sapiens et rebus honestis;\r\n  nam quae docta nimis cupit et facunda videri,\r\n  crure tenus medio tunicas succingere debet,\r\n  caedere Silvano porcum, quadrante lavari.\r\n  non habeat matrona, tibi quae iuncta recumbit,\r\n  dicendi genus, aut curvum sermone rotato\r\n  torqueat enthymema, nec historias sciat omnes,\r\n  sed quaedam ex libris et non intellegat. Odi\r\n  hanc ego quae repetit volvitque Palaemonis artem\r\n  servata semper lege et ratione loquendi\r\n  ignotosque mihi tenet antiquaria versus\r\n  nec curanda viris opicae castigat amicae\r\n  verba: soloecismum liceat fecisse marito.\r\n\r\n                                      JUVENAL: Satire VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhile there is excellent authority for the statement that the Holy\r\nRoman Empire was not holy nor Roman nor an empire, the reader of\r\nmediaeval history has, for a century and a half, been left without\r\nan equally trenchant definition of what that empire was. In like\r\nmanner, while it is comparatively easy for the student of modern\r\nmanners to assert that \"literary London\" is neither London nor\r\nliterary, he might find it difficult to amplify this in positive\r\nterms unless he described it as \"cultured Kensington.\" The first\r\nphrase, like its baffling brethren \"a man-about-town\" and \"the\r\nOxford manner,\" to which reference has already been made, is part\r\nof modern currency and is tendered by the press and accepted by the\r\npublic without a thought on either side whether it represents any\r\nvalue as an idea. Is the literary London to which newspapers refer\r\nsynonymous with the committee of the Authors' Society? Is it to be\r\nfound, of a Sunday afternoon, at Mrs. Leo Hunter's house? Does it\r\nlurk, unrecognised and fiercely retiring, in that district which\r\ncabmen call Chelsea and more poetic spirits \"the Latin Quarter of\r\nLondon\"?\r\n\r\nOr is it but a flight of fancy, like \"the upper ten\" or \"the middle\r\nclasses\"?\r\n\r\nRegret is sometimes expressed that there is no assembly in which\r\nall men-of-letters can gather and explain--in a phrase beloved of\r\nH. G. Wells--\"what they are up to.\" Though the experiment had often\r\nbeen tried, it has always failed. There is, indeed, an abundance of\r\nliterary societies which meet for dinner and damnable iteration in\r\nhonour of one or other \"immortal memory\"; there is a plethora of\r\nthe larger, looser associations which have been formed to entertain\r\nauthors and, in sheer lust for culture, to submit to their\r\nlectures. There are houses from which no author is long secure;\r\nthere are clubs, founded to aid their members in life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness, where authors meet in large numbers. But\r\nthere is no one literary clearing-house, there is nothing that can\r\nbe called \"literary London.\" For this, the unreflecting world is\r\nnot always sufficiently grateful.\r\n\r\nThe first business of a poet, it may be submitted, is to write\r\npoetry rather than to talk about what he has written; the\r\nsecond, to write it by himself, as the pure, unaided expression\r\nof his genius, rather than to labour under the limitations and\r\nconfusions of a school; the third, to let his poetry stand as its\r\nown explanation and apology to the critics and to the public.\r\nIf, in the end, his readers persist in wishing to discuss it\r\nwith him, he may not always be able to escape, though he may\r\nforestall disappointment by warning them that, because a man can\r\nexpress himself on paper, he need not be able to express himself\r\nin conversation and that the poet in hours of idleness is not\r\nnecessarily better worth meeting than the dentist on holiday. This\r\n_caveat_ once entered, he can offer no further resistance, short\r\nof a blunt refusal, to the hostesses who are still eager to secure\r\n\"the distinguished author\" of this or that: sooner or later his\r\nneck will be bent over their dinner-tables.\r\n\r\nThere follows one of two inevitable results: the author, from\r\nmodesty or self-consciousness, curvets and shies from the one\r\nsubject which he has been summoned to discuss and takes refuge in\r\nthe Russian ballet and Ascot;[50] or else he resigns himself to his\r\napotheosis and gobbles more complimentary sugar-plums than are good\r\nfor his soul's digestion; he is fated to spoil the party or to be\r\nspoiled by it.\r\n\r\nNext in the preparation of his spiritual downfall comes the bland\r\nassumption that the creator must also be a critic; when he has\r\nadequately descanted upon his own books, he will be required to\r\ngive an opinion on the books of others. These, unless he loftily\r\n(but impressively) refuse to admit that there have been poets\r\nsince Shelley, he never wholly condemns for fear of seeming vain\r\nor small-minded, though he may sometimes admit that he has not had\r\ntime to read them; it is easier to disparage by flattery and to\r\nsay that his rival has not yet done his best work or that he will\r\nnever give rein to his genius until he is less influenced by the\r\nspell of Swinburne (within an hour this has been crystallised into\r\nthe judgement that \"X writes such dreadful Swinburne-and-water\");\r\nit is easier still to shake a regretful head and to hope that X is\r\nnot sacrificing Art to Popularity. As a rule the creator-critic\r\npraises vehemently, thus gaining for himself a reputation for\r\ngenerosity and doing service to a friend who is doing him the\r\nsame service at that moment in another part of London. Mutual\r\nadmiration and log-rolling have not changed since Du Maurier\r\nsatirised them in the _Punches_ of the eighties; and the gentle\r\nart of self-advertisement has at least not diminished in the\r\nresourcefulness of its technique during the last forty years. There\r\nare, however, so many opportunities of securing a wider publicity\r\nthat the author who shews himself off in a drawing-room is wasting\r\nhis time and energy: the columns of the press are already open to\r\nhim, and, as his new book draws near to publication, he can always\r\ndirect attention to himself by inaugurating a discussion on the\r\npagan tendency of modern poetry or on the victimisation of young\r\npoets by unscrupulous editors; he can let himself be persuaded into\r\nspeaking at public dinners and having his speeches reported; he can\r\nbe affably at hand when professional writers of paragraphs are\r\nshort of copy. If it be his ambition to keep his name before the\r\npublic, he can without difficulty emulate the methods of one author\r\nwho backed himself to be mentioned in the press on every day of the\r\nyear--and won his wager. It may be doubted, nevertheless, whether\r\npublic or private popularity-seeking is good for the fibre of a\r\nman's soul.\r\n\r\nIf a writer should avoid the food and flattery of the professional\r\nlion-hunter, so, for a different reason, he should resist the\r\ntemptation to closet himself with those who are plying the same\r\ntrade. If it produce nothing else, the inevitable discussion of\r\nhimself and of his work produces self-consciousness; and a man\r\nwill commonly achieve less valuable results by harkening for the\r\napplause of a clique or by trying to follow lines and tendencies\r\nset by a committee. The great work of art is individual; and,\r\nthough a painter may have his school, though the technique of\r\npainting is usually taught in a school, there is no ground for\r\nthinking that a man may be taught to write by those who are\r\nthemselves learning.\r\n\r\nAs an author should work by himself to produce what is in him,\r\nso, when he has produced it, he should neither explain nor\r\ncomplain. It is perhaps a counsel of perfection to say that\r\nauthors and critics should never meet. Mr. Walkley has expounded\r\nthis difficulty in dramatic criticism: is the critic to eschew\r\nthe actor's company? Is he to rise from the same dinner-table and\r\nslay his friend in print? Should he disparage a friend for fear of\r\npartiality or praise an unknown playwright because he is unknown?\r\nThe difficulties are not less great when the novelist and his\r\ncritic are on terms of friendship; but literature and criticism\r\nboth suffer when this personal relationship is used to influence\r\nthe author or the critic. As a rule the press, turning its back\r\non the brutalities of the early nineteenth century, encourages the\r\nnew writer and relieves its feelings at the expense of one who is\r\nconsidered to be \"established\"; in dramatic criticism it generally\r\nignores the newcomer and atones later for its neglect by praising\r\nindiscriminately the man who has won his niche. Either practise may\r\nbe considered as at least no more senseless than any other which\r\ncriticises the writer rather than the book that he has written. No\r\nreasonable man will object so long as criticism is independent of\r\npersonal obligations, advertisement-revenue, æsthetic prejudice and\r\nprivate predilections; so long, too, as the reviewer is neither a\r\ncareless young man in a hurry to create on his own account, nor an\r\nembittered old man who has tried and failed; so long, finally, as\r\nthe critic brings to his task as much experience, self-discipline\r\nand labour as the author has given to his.\r\n\r\nThe danger which threatens the deliberate formation of a literary\r\nsociety is that authors and critics will both lose something of\r\ntheir independence. In other callings there is often a rigid\r\netiquette to protect social intercourse from professional abuse:\r\nthe barrister who dines too regularly with solicitors will expose\r\nhimself to suspicion, and the surgeon is expected to shew by his\r\ndemeanour that his guests are friends and not potential patients.\r\nAmong writers there is no recognised etiquette and, though the\r\nman whose friendship with reviewers secures him a good press may\r\nbe despised by some, he is envied by more. This is no new vice;\r\nand its ill effects are limited by the logic of facts, whereby a\r\ngood press cannot for ever sell bad books. Vested interests in\r\ncriticism only become formidable to literature when the spheres\r\nof creation and criticism overlap and when critic-creators combine\r\nto organise a crusade. The complaint has of late been heard that\r\nliterary criticism in London is being syndicated: six or eight\r\npapers are said to be inspired by four or five critic-creators who\r\nset their own standard of taste and value, praise one another's\r\nwork and advance across literary no-man's-land in massed formation.\r\nIt is easy to make too much of this. The amiable practise of mutual\r\nback-patting has always existed; the honest zealots of literature\r\nhave always tried to define a formula for exclusive literary\r\nsalvation; and those who stood outside the ring have always fumed\r\nand protested.[51] Is there anything new in Fleet Street? Or in\r\nthose who accept Fleet Street at a pontifical valuation? When\r\nwill authors learn how very little influence the press can exert\r\nover a book? The favourable review of a good book may hasten its\r\nrecognition; the unfavourable review of a bad book may retard that\r\nmeasure of success which even the worst book achieves; but, after\r\nthe first indeterminate months of life, favourable reviews will not\r\nsell a bad book, nor unfavourable kill a good.[52]\r\n\r\nIf, then, an author shews to disadvantage at his apotheosis\r\nenforced and if he cannot be left alone with fellow-authors lest\r\nhe preach that his doxy is orthodoxy and that every other doxy is\r\nheterodoxy, is there any virtue in a literary clearing-house where\r\nany one man of letters can be sure, sooner or later, of finding\r\nevery other? The _salon_ is not acclimatised to London; while it\r\nflourishes in Dublin and Paris, it languishes here for want of a\r\nhostess to inspire it. Daily and nightly throughout the year there\r\nare parties at which eminent men of letters are present in force,\r\nwith a flanking claque of women who have expressed vague desire\r\nto meet them; the general judgement on them is as true now as the\r\nparticular judgement which Oscar Wilde passed some thirty years\r\nago on \"Lady Brandon,\" who \"tried to found a _salon_, and only\r\nsucceeded in opening a restaurant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIf there is no literary London, most men of letters must have\r\nencountered a widespread belief that there should be, even that\r\nthere is. The appropriate atmosphere is sedulously cultivated;\r\nundaunted explorers divide the map into private reservations.\r\n\r\nLeft to themselves and in the absence of a general meeting-place,\r\nauthors--who are at heart quite normally human, liking and\r\ndisliking what other men like and dislike--assemble in ordinary\r\nclubs and ordinary houses. In the first they are still liable\r\nto be from time to time disturbed by an epidemic delusion that\r\nthey are conversationalists of unusual power and charm: more than\r\none club has suffered from the belief that, because A and B are\r\nauthors, they must be conversationalists and that, because they\r\nare conversationalists, the club must be exceptionally well worth\r\njoining; when the premises are sound, more than one club has been\r\nruined by the reputation of its conversationalists; the performers\r\nbecome occasionally despotic and tiresome; and, as in the long run\r\neven club bores die, their death leaves among their mute audiences\r\nno one to succeed them.\r\n\r\nDespite this recurrent danger, certain clubs stand apart from\r\nthe rest in the love which they inspire among authors. For them\r\nthe Athenæum ranks first, with its long list of members who have\r\nachieved distinction in literature; and the privilege of membership\r\ncarries with it, by implication, the honour of having been weighed\r\nand found worthy of admission to a society which is without\r\nrival, among the clubs of the world, for the volume and variety\r\nof its learning. To the Reform Club and to its literary roll from\r\nThackeray to Wells reference has already been made; the Garrick can\r\non occasion mobilise an even braver army of authors; and the Savile\r\nlist is not to be ignored. To men of more Bohemian intention, the\r\nSavage has long made a catholic appeal; and the Beefsteak, with\r\nits genius for securing a little of the best of everything, has\r\nnot disdained the man of letters. The clubs in which a veneration\r\nfor Dickens or Thackeray, Johnson or Omar Khayyám furnishes a\r\npretext to the members for dining together are too numerous to be\r\nset out, but no club or group of clubs can constitute anything\r\nthat may be called literary London; and, though each may foster\r\nfriendships which might otherwise have been retarded, it remains\r\ntrue for normal men that the largest number of the pleasantest\r\nmeetings takes place in private houses where the author is invited\r\nas a friend instead of being summoned as a purveyor of \"literary\"\r\natmosphere. There is no law against mental vivisection; but authors\r\nmight welcome one.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to seek a more recondite explanation than that\r\nthey are wonderfully like the rest of their fellow-creatures and\r\nshould be treated no differently. They eat and sleep, they marry\r\nand beget children, they entertain and are entertained, they serve\r\non juries and pay income-tax, for all the world as though they were\r\nbill-brokers and average-adjusters; if they know their own subject\r\nas well as a staff-officer and a cotton-spinner know theirs, it\r\ntakes little longer to discern their limitations. \"All mad--but\r\nwonderfully decent\" was the verdict passed by Master Stubbs, the\r\nbudding banker, on M. and Mde. Berthelini in _Providence and a\r\nGuitar_; but the modern imaginative artist is almost distressingly\r\nsane and practical; of the leading English novelists several began\r\nas schoolmasters, one or two as barristers, one as a solicitor's\r\nclerk, another as a merchant-seaman. It is hard to believe that\r\nthey enjoy being treated as a class apart. A few, indeed, may wear\r\neccentric clothes, for reasons of health, comfort or eccentricity,\r\nbut then so do a few cabinet ministers, peers of the realm, civil\r\nservants and masters of hounds; a few have pronounced mannerisms,\r\nbut then so have certain bishops, bankers and family-solicitors.\r\nA sparse handful may segregate themselves in an artistic secret\r\nsociety, but this same boyish trait can be found in religion,\r\npolitics and finance. When the conscientiously eccentric have been\r\neliminated, such authors as are to be found in London incline to\r\nthe same collective average as any other class: there are bores\r\nand prigs, rich and poor, puffed-up and humble, dandies and\r\nscarecrows, courtiers and hobbledehoys, fanatics and men of the\r\nworld; and it is only when a man differentiates his species by\r\nfrank advertisement or by less frank posturing about his art that\r\nthe rest of humanity has to be careful.\r\n\r\nOf convincing any one but an author that this contention is true\r\nno hope need be entertained: the glamour and mystery of art are\r\nas indestructible as the appeal of the stage. An atmosphere is\r\ncultivated for the artist and imposed upon him. \"With Rothenstein,\"\r\nsays Max Beerbohm in his tender study of Enoch Soames, \"I paid my\r\nfirst visit to the Bodley Head. By him I was inducted into another\r\nhaunt of intellect and daring, the domino room of the Café Royal.\r\n\r\n\"There, on that October evening--there, in that exuberant vista of\r\ngilding and crimson velvet set amidst all those opposing mirrors\r\nand upholding caryatids, with fumes of tobacco ever rising to the\r\npainted and pagan ceiling, and with the hum of presumably cynical\r\nconversation broken into so sharply now and again by the clatter of\r\ndominoes shuffled on marble tables, I drew a deep breath, and 'This\r\nindeed,' said I to myself, 'is life!'\r\n\r\n\"It was the hour before dinner. We drank vermouth. Those who knew\r\nRothenstein were pointing him out to those who knew him only by\r\nname. Men were constantly coming in through the swing-doors and\r\nwandering slowly up and down in search of vacant tables, or of\r\ntables occupied by friends. One of these rovers interested me\r\nbecause I was sure he wanted to catch Rothenstein's eye. He had\r\ntwice passed our table, with a hesitating look; but Rothenstein,\r\nin the thick of a disquisition on Puvis de Chavannes, had not seen\r\nhim. He was a stooping, shambling person, rather tall, very pale,\r\nwith longish and brownish hair. He had a thin vague beard--or\r\nrather, he had a chin on which a large number of hairs weakly\r\ncurled and clustered to cover its retreat. He was an odd-looking\r\nperson; but in the 'nineties odd apparitions were more frequent,\r\nI think, than they are now. The young writers of that era--and I\r\nwas sure this man was a writer--strove earnestly to be distinct\r\nin aspect. This man had striven unsuccessfully. He wore a soft\r\nblack hat of clerical kind but of Bohemian intention, and a grey\r\nwaterproof cape which, perhaps because it was waterproof, failed\r\nto be romantic. I decided that 'dim' was the _mot juste_ for him.\r\nI had already essayed to write, and was immensely keen on the _mot\r\njuste_, that Holy Grail of the period....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMax Beerbohm was writing of 1893; and, though it is presumption to\r\ncriticise this sketch of the domino room, he has not explicitly\r\ndescribed one aspect of the Café Royal which was observable in that\r\nyear, which is observable still and which, no doubt, will endure\r\nas long as the building itself. Though the cape, perhaps because\r\nit was waterproof, failed to be romantic, it enclosed a spirit\r\nhungry for romance; the Café Royal is still full of souls no less\r\nhungry, though it has never yet succeeded in being romantic. Odd\r\napparitions are frequent enough; some writers of this era try to\r\nbe distinct in aspect; they have not outgrown their keenness for\r\nthe _mot juste_; and all their spirit's striving is of Bohemian\r\nintention. In the hour before dinner vermouth is still drunk; there\r\nis still a hum of presumably cynical conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Café Royal, indeed, changes but little because it satisfies an\r\nunchanging need: a literary conception of Bohemian life has created\r\na demand for its embodiment in a \"haunt of intellect and daring,\"\r\ntentatively Parisian if a little self-conscious, very fearless if\r\nnever quite at ease. Year after year, wide-eyed new generations\r\nsay to themselves, \"This indeed is life.\" The Café Royal is\r\nmore than a literary institution, it is a social safety-valve:\r\nromance, after its little seething, disappears in steam; an hour's\r\ncynical conversation, a glass or two of vermouth, a display of the\r\ndistinctive aspect enable many a young man to return home healed\r\nin spirit to tidy himself and to reappear next morning as a sober,\r\nlaborious and punctual British subject.\r\n\r\nIf chance or design closed this safety-valve, the pent passion\r\nfor romance would be driven inwards until it exploded in the\r\nvery heart of domesticity. Intellectual adolescence must play at\r\nBohemianism as youth plays at soldiers; it is better to restrict\r\nthe game to one lawful area than to allow it to rage unconfined,\r\nfor the English home is not adapted to absinthe-drinking, and a\r\ngeneral repudiation of morality shocks without elevating. Under\r\nthe unsettling influence of war, which closed the Café Royal at\r\nnight before the taste for literary romance had been satisfied,\r\nthere was a severe outbreak of studio-parties at which every one\r\nshewed himself conscientiously unrestrained and fearless; poets and\r\npainters discussed the aims and methods of their art; strange food\r\nand drink appeared disconcertingly; conversation was carried on in\r\nshouts; there was more colour than line in the dresses; every one\r\nsat on the floor until the host gave the signal for dancing; only\r\nVirginian cigarettes were smoked; and, at the end, it was never\r\npossible to find a taxi. It is to be hoped that the artists worked\r\nthe better for this breezy liberation of soul; it is to be wished\r\nthat they had done more and talked less of what they were going to\r\ndo; but it is to be realised that they were unwitting and perhaps\r\nunwilling victims of a conspiracy to make London literary.\r\n\r\nThis craving finds its frankest expression in the meetings of\r\ncertain more formal literary seminars. Here, though the dresses,\r\nthe intellectual freedom and the insufficiency of chairs are the\r\nsame, there is strict procedure: the guest of the evening is\r\nreceived with deference and heard with attention; there follows\r\na grave debate in which conventional compliments usher in a set\r\nspeech of destructive criticism; after a vote of thanks, the\r\naddress is once more examined in the candid atmosphere of lemonade\r\nand sandwiches, and the guest is asked whether he really meant all\r\nthat he said. Rash is the man who trifles with such earnest desire\r\nfor improvement: he might well find himself not invited a second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSo much for the atmosphere which is imposed upon an author.\r\nIf he be more man than peacock, flattery will bring him less\r\ngratification than embarrassment; and he may ask in modesty and\r\nwrath why he should be subjected to treatment from which others are\r\nexempt. The barrister is not forced to expound the principles of\r\npleading to a hushed dinner-table; no one collects a party to meet\r\nthe chairman of an insurance-company. The answer, presumably, would\r\nbe that, while there is a legal London and a financial London, no\r\none has yet created a literary London and all are entitled to try.\r\n\r\nThe initial procedure is commonly the same. Dotted over a wide\r\nexpanse between Chelsea and St. John's Wood are scores of houses\r\nin which one determined woman has, in the first instance, caught\r\nand tamed a single author: he is as much a member of the family as\r\nthe butler; and his employer would be justly incensed if any one\r\ntried to tempt him away with an offer of better wages. At first\r\nhe is a prize in himself, and in his honour parties are given\r\nuntil his owner has established her reputation as a patron of\r\nliterature; later he is a decoy for other prizes; and B., who might\r\nnot come of his own accord, is invited to meet A. Here the artistic\r\nambition is reinforced by the social: the Duchess of Stilton, who\r\nhas hitherto ignored Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns, is lured by the\r\nbait of Mr. Cimabue Brown and Mr. Postlethwaite; and the churl who\r\ntosses all invitations unread into his waste-paper-basket may quite\r\npossibly do for the Duchess of Stilton what he has always refused\r\nto do for Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns. _Noblesse oblige_ has been\r\nfreely rendered: \"One must be obliging to duchesses.\" From this\r\npoint the game develops automatically; and the triumphant hostess\r\nrealises her ambition as the acknowledged ruler of one or other\r\npostal district of London. If any one would meet this Bloomsbury\r\nimpressionist or that Hampstead sculptor, he must meet him in her\r\nhouse; she has proclaimed her reservation, and henceforth, so long\r\nas she can maintain herself, Westminster or Pimlico, Chelsea or\r\nGolders Green, with all that they contain, are hers. Ceasing to\r\ncourt others, she is herself courted.\r\n\r\nWhether she is repaid in the result for her necessary first\r\nhumiliations she alone can decide. Her pretensions are ridiculed\r\nby those who accept her hospitality; she is too busy adding to her\r\nacquaintances to spare time for making friends; and amid all the\r\ninsincerity of her life the one thing brutally sincere is the\r\ningratitude of those who treat her house as a free menagerie. So it\r\nhas been since the days of Du Maurier; but, in spite of satire and\r\nridicule, her breed continues. Perhaps her only alternative is to\r\nlook after a husband and children; perhaps she is consoled by the\r\nmagnitude of her achievement in founding a _salon_ on the strength\r\nof a resident poet; perhaps she is unconscious of the figure which\r\nshe cuts. Literary snobbishness is no more attractive than any\r\nother kind; and it is to be hoped that she sins of ignorance rather\r\nthan of malice.\r\n\r\nIf, no longer hoping, some continue to wish that her breed were\r\nless hardy, that is because all efforts to create a literary London\r\ninspire misgivings for the free development of literature. It is\r\nan author's own fault if he submits to being petted by otherwise\r\nsensible men and women who will lavish on novelists, actors,\r\nmusicians and artists a flattery of which they cannot spare one\r\nthousandth part for scientists, philosophers, humanitarians and\r\nthe great industrial rulers;[53] it is a fault for which he shares\r\nresponsibility with his maker if he allows his head to be turned by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe danger to author and reader from any organised or even\r\nstimulated literary discussion is one which he cannot control; and,\r\nrealising that there is, indisputably, a \"musical London\" and that\r\nits existence has sent musical snobbishness to a premium and the\r\nfreedom of musical development to a discount, he fears the same\r\nfate for literature. It is the common vice of the _salon_, of the\r\ncritical syndicate (if such exist) and of any unofficial \"academy\"\r\nthat they tend equally to pass premature judgements and to force\r\nuniformity upon the hangers-on. They hustle their heroes into the\r\nPantheon or the pauper-grave before life is out of their bodies.\r\nPrizes are now awarded for the best imaginative work of the year.\r\nThe critics are already trying to decide which of the younger men\r\nand women are qualified to succeed H. G. Wells and Arnold Bennett.\r\nMacaulay himself could not have displayed a wilder passion for\r\nclass-lists and labels.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the thoughtful articles which undertake to spot\r\nliterary winners are articles no more thoughtful but perhaps\r\nplayfully philosophical in which to-day's tipsters expose the\r\nfolly of their predecessors. Who now reads Mrs. Humphry Ward? Yet\r\nit is less than forty years since _Robert Elsmere_ marked her out\r\nas the successor to George Eliot. Who now reads George Eliot?\r\n\"Herbert Spencer,\" recalls Mr. Edmund Gosse, \"... expressed a\r\nstrong objection to the purchase of fiction, and wished that for\r\nthe London library no novels should be bought 'except, of course,\r\nthose of George Eliot.' While she lived, critics compared her with\r\nGoethe, but to the disadvantage of the sage of Weimar.... For Lord\r\nActon at her death 'the sun had gone out'; and that exceedingly\r\ndogmatic historian observed, _ex cathedra_, that no writer had\r\n'ever lived who had anything like her power of manifold but\r\ndisinterested and impartial sympathy. If Sophocles or Cervantes\r\nhad lived in the light of our culture, if Dante had prospered\r\nlike Manzoni, George Eliot might have had a rival.' It is very\r\ndangerous,\" adds Mr. Gosse judiciously, \"to write like that....\"\r\n\r\nIn fifty years' time will any one read Herbert Spencer? Or Lord\r\nActon?[54] It was stated at the time of George Meredith's death\r\nthat his executors refused for him the honour of burial in\r\nWestminster Abbey because one of them believed that in a hundred\r\nyears' time he would be unread; his admirers are even now divided\r\nover the question whether he was a great novelist who wrote less\r\ngreat poetry or a great poet who wrote less great novels. The\r\nsame fate lies ahead of Thomas Hardy. Battle has already been\r\njoined over the body of Henry James: to one school he is the\r\ngreat analytical psychologist who revolutionised novel-writing,\r\nthe perfect artist, the subtile craftsman with the inimitably\r\npersonal style; to another he is the pretentious, untidy amateur,\r\nthe man who never learned to select or to compress, the pompous\r\npet of a Chelsea group, the windy impostor with thumbs for fingers\r\nwho partially buried under involution his lack of style and his\r\nignorance of punctuation. One school swears by \"the novels of the\r\nmiddle period\"; another harks back to _Roderick Hudson_; a third\r\nprays _The Turn of the Screw_ in aid and proclaims him less a\r\nnovelist than a master of the short story; one of the three most\r\nhighly esteemed living English novelists likens him to an elephant\r\ntrying to pick up peas with its trunk; and he was decorated with\r\nthe Order of Merit.\r\n\r\nWhat hardly any one will do is to suspend judgement; and the first\r\nbusiness of literary society is to ensure that judgement shall not\r\nbe suspended. Not only has a label to be fixed, but the humblest\r\namateur feels obliged to say whether it was rightly fixed: praise\r\nand proscription are bandied among those who have hardly learned to\r\nread and those who have never been trained to think. When the Henry\r\nJames cult became fashionable, he received equally rapt devotion\r\nfrom those who disliked him, from those who did not understand\r\nhim and from those who had not read him. James was elevated into\r\na literary standard; he collected a following of disciples; those\r\nwho flattered him by imitation were flattered in turn by his\r\nfrank approval. The bellow of the herd drowned the voice of the\r\nindividual. In all the calendar of critical crime there is no more\r\nsoul-destroying dishonesty than a second-hand opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe same premature labelling may be seen in \"musical London\" with\r\nthe appearance of every new composer and the exhumation of every\r\nold score. While Verdi is tolerated and Gounod deplored, Ravel\r\nis--at the moment--a safe winner, and a liking for Delius commands\r\nrespect, Debussy holds his own; Richard Strauss is still a bone\r\nof friendly contention; de Lara and Ethel Smyth are encouraged as\r\nBritish composers by a perplexed audience which has been taught to\r\ndistrust British compositions; but \"musical London\" has decided\r\nthat it is time for a reaction against Puccini.\r\n\r\nDoes \"musical London\" ever turn an introspective eye to watch the\r\nmanufacture of musical opinion? The spectator who wanders from\r\nbox to box on the first night of a new opera, may see the gentle\r\nherd-hypnotism at work.\r\n\r\n_The Honest Ignoramus, who goes to Covent Garden to see his friends\r\nbetween the acts._ \"Well, what d'you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n_The Languid Woman who will not give herself away._ \"I heard it in\r\nMonte Carlo, you know, this winter.\"\r\n\r\n_A Voice._ It's a pure crib from _The Barber_.\r\n\r\n_Another._ Rossini and water.\r\n\r\n_Another._ It's quite too deliciously old-fashioned.\r\n\r\n_The Honest Ignoramus strays into the next box, shedding some of\r\nhis honesty by the way._ \"Rather Rossini and water, don't you\r\nthink? I don't know anything about it, of course, but it seemed to\r\n_me_ a mere up-to-date _Barber_.\"\r\n\r\n_A Voice._ It's very modern certainly. I confess I'm rather\r\nold-fashioned....\r\n\r\nHe moves on. \"D'you like all this modern stuff?

I suppose some people would call\r\nit a bit modern, but it's rather a relief to find a man who's not\r\nafraid to use his orchestra. The, er, wood-wind....\"\r\n\r\n_All (gratefully)._ \"Too wonderful!... Were you here on\r\nThursday?...\"\r\n\r\nThe press-notices next day will add a few more technical terms,\r\nbut regular attendants at the opera can say whether this is a\r\ncaricature of the manner in which contemporary musical opinion is\r\nformed.[55] None will wait to think; few will shew the courage\r\nto express their own unsupported feelings; every one will pass a\r\ncriticism of some kind. And, when the aggregate judgement has been\r\nlaunched, all will be half converted to it. Perhaps only financial\r\ngood or harm is done to a contemporary work, but \"musical London\"\r\nwill not so circumscribe its criticism: there must be an opinion on\r\neverything, a label for every one; and against the verdict of the\r\nhour there is, in all eternity, no appeal.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, is the weakness of all artistic criticism: the critic\r\nis as greatly influenced by atmosphere, fashion and the æsthetic\r\nlimitations of a period as the creator; sometimes it is the same\r\natmosphere, and each new novel by George Eliot was acclaimed a\r\nclassic because her critics believed as strongly in her formula as\r\nshe did; sometimes the atmosphere is different, and readers in this\r\ngeneration may praise Wordsworth and belittle Byron as vehemently\r\nas another generation praised Byron and belittled Wordsworth. Will\r\nit never be understood that in æsthetic taste there can be no\r\nfinality?\r\n\r\nThere is little harm in awarding a Nobel or a Hawthornden prize\r\nif we remember that the judges are breathing the same atmosphere\r\nas the candidates and that their verdict concerns an author of\r\ntheir own generation; in forty years' time their taste may\r\nseem as grotesquely perverted as that of the mid-Victorians who\r\nexhausted their superlatives on George Eliot or of the assassin\r\nwho struck down Keats. That is the price exacted of the critic by\r\nposterity for the infallibility which he enjoys in his lifetime.\r\nThe harm is done when these verdicts are accepted at second-hand\r\nby a public which has not read the evidence nor heard the trial.\r\nIt is neither practicable nor desirable that the work of to-day\r\nshould be pusillanimously referred to the judgement of to-morrow;\r\nbut an artistic assessment, to have any value, must be the sum\r\nof individual and independent opinions. That independence would\r\ndisappear with the birth of a literary London. The propaganda of\r\na coterie, the direction of critics, the explanations of authors\r\nand the herd-voice of literary society narrow artistic sympathy\r\nand stunt artistic originality. Long may England be spared the\r\nunofficial Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS IN A DISSOLVING VIEW\r\n\r\n        Often when warring for he wist not what,\r\n        An enemy-soldier, passing by one weak,\r\n        Has tendered water, wiped the burning cheek,\r\n        And cooled the lips so black and clammed and hot;\r\n\r\n        Then gone his way, and maybe quite forgot\r\n        The deed of grace amid the roar and reek;\r\n        Yet larger vision than the tongue can speak\r\n        He there has reached, although he has known it not\r\n\r\n        For natural mindsight, triumphing in the act\r\n        Over the throes of artificial rage,\r\n        Has thuswise muffled victory's peal of pride,\r\n        Rended to ribands policy's specious page\r\n        That deals but with evasion, code, and pact,\r\n        And war's apology wholly stultified.\r\n\r\n  1915.                    THOMAS HARDY: \"_Often When Warring._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn the life of the English generation which found its climax and\r\ncatastrophe in the war, the last chapter opened on armistice day\r\nand closed with the signature of the German peace treaty on July\r\n19th, 1919. As with the armistice terms, so with the treaty: no one\r\ndoubted that it would be signed, but, until it had been signed, all\r\nefforts at reconstruction, all attempts to resume a normal life\r\nof peace were tentative and provisional. The House of Commons in\r\neffect declared a legislative moratorium and, in the absence of\r\nthe prime minister, marked time to the command of Mr. Bonar Law\r\nwith the disciplined noise and the calculated absence of progress\r\ninseparable from that part of infantry drill.\r\n\r\nAs the general election of the previous December had been won on\r\nthe cry that a coalition was necessary to the conclusion of a\r\nlasting peace, it might have been expected that the supporters\r\nof the coalition would have influenced the course of the peace\r\nnegotiations. Beyond an occasional question, however, which\r\nseldom brought enlightenment to the questioner, and an occasional\r\ntelegram of protest which can never have brought satisfaction to\r\nthe protester, coalition members gave the government a free hand.\r\nIn part, there were comparatively few with any parliamentary\r\nexperience; in part, there was none who could draft a desirable\r\nalternative ministry, if his dissatisfaction with the present\r\nprime minister stimulated him to effective revolt; and, in part,\r\nthere has probably never, since 1832, been a House of Commons so\r\nbankrupt in public spirit, courage, independence or conscience.\r\nSince the end of 1918 the government has triumphantly carried its\r\nsupporters against their inclinations through a dozen crises of\r\nwhich any single one would have seen any other ministry disowned\r\nand broken by a less servile house: the peace treaty with Germany,\r\nas mischievous as it was dishonourable, was flung at parliament\r\nwith an air of \"Take it--or leave it and take the consequences\";\r\nthe treaty with Turkey established the Ottoman government in\r\nConstantinople with licence to misgovern and to massacre as freely\r\nas in the past; the Russian policy began with invective and threats\r\nof war against the bloody-handed soviet and ended with the cordial\r\ngrip of a hand which had only become more bloody in the interval;\r\nIreland drifted through pats of conciliation and dabs of coercion\r\nto a state of anarchy which ministers hoped to end by means of a\r\nnew home rule bill abhorred by every section of Irishmen; and,\r\nwhile financiers protested that the country had reached its taxable\r\ncapacity, the government continued to live beyond its means and the\r\nchancellor of the exchequer complained that it was not in his power\r\nto retrench effectively.\r\n\r\nFor a similar display of cynical incompetence and reckless disorder\r\nthe historian must go back to the days of a great autocracy in\r\ndissolution. The government of Louis XVI or of the last Roman\r\nemperor, would perhaps shew an equal record of vacillations,\r\nlethargy and light-hearted misrule; but in both instances anarchy\r\nended in downfall; and, if history be past politics, present\r\npolitics are future history. It is hardly straining the parallel\r\nto suggest that such misgovernment is always attributable to one\r\ncause, the lack of an efficient opposition; a composite government\r\nunchecked by fear of overthrow and uninspired by any loftier ideal\r\nthan a groping instinct of self-preservation, is no less tyrannical\r\nand prone to abuse than a single ruler.\r\n\r\n \"These various Cæsars and their successors and their women-kind,\"\r\n says H. G. Wells, \"were probably no worse essentially than most\r\n weak and passionate human beings, but they had no real religion,\r\n being themselves gods; they had no wide knowledge on which\r\n to build high ambitions, their women were fierce and almost\r\n illiterate, and they were under no restraints of law or custom.\r\n They were surrounded by creatures ready to stimulate their\r\n slightest wishes and to translate their vaguest impulses into\r\n action. What are mere passing black thoughts and angry impulses\r\n with most of us became therefore deeds with them. Before a man\r\n condemns Nero as a different species of being from himself, he\r\n should examine his own secret thoughts very carefully.\"\r\n\r\nIt is less profitable to condemn the present government than to\r\nenquire why there has been no effective opposition to hold it in\r\ncheck. The political revolution which placed Mr. Lloyd George\r\nin power was described by Mr. Asquith as a \"conspiracy\"; it was\r\ngenerally regarded as a discreditable piece of trickery, and even\r\nthe stalwarts of the new order were for the most part reduced to\r\nmumbling that the end must justify the means and that, without a\r\nchange, the war would have dragged on for ever. It is possible\r\nto see now that a psychological crisis was reached in December\r\n1916 and that after more than two years of unending and unended\r\nfighting the herd-instinct demanded that someone should be made\r\nresponsible. To the bulk of the liberal party who stood by Mr.\r\nAsquith, forgiving his high-handed behaviour in resigning without\r\nan adverse vote and without consultation of his supporters, the\r\nDecember crisis seemed a trial of strength between two men; it was\r\nbelieved first that no alternative ministry could be formed and\r\nthen that it could not endure; the opposition liberals would have\r\nbeen more than human if they had cherished no hope of revenge; and\r\nthey could claim disinterestedly and honestly that the new prime\r\nminister was at least not superior to the old in scruple and was\r\ncertainly inferior in ability.\r\n\r\nHowever great their resentment, however, the new management had\r\nto be given a trial; any show of factiousness would have been\r\ndoubtful patriotism and disastrous tactics; and the chief subject\r\nof discussion among the wire-pullers was how long the trial should\r\ncontinue. Much noise and dust accompanied Mr. Lloyd George's\r\ntriumphal progress to No. 10 Downing Street; at last a \"business\r\ngovernment\" had taken office, and Whitehall became filled with the\r\nunfamiliar forms of shipping-men and railway-men, newspaper-men and\r\nmining-men, all disciplined by practical experience at the head of\r\ngreat commercial enterprises, though unschooled to the teamwork\r\nof administration in which the pace and independence of each are\r\nregulated by his fellows. For a moment the political crisis seemed\r\na successful _bourgeois_ protest against the spirit and methods of\r\nBalliol: neither Mr. Lloyd George nor Lord Beaverbrook, neither\r\nLord Northcliffe nor Lord Rothermere, neither Sir Eric Geddes nor\r\nSir Joseph Maclay, neither Lord Rhondda nor Mr. Neville Chamberlain\r\nwas a Balliol man; and in his strength and in his weakness, in\r\nhis mechanical efficiency and blank want of imagination, in his\r\nintellectual aloofness and touching belief that others too observed\r\nan Oxford standard of honour, Mr. Asquith was a typical product of\r\nBalliol.[56]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the dust and noise of removal had abated, there\r\nwere found to be at least as many defects of administration as\r\nbefore; the wizard's wand failed to charm food from air or to\r\nconjure up men from the vasty deep in place of those who were being\r\nsent to rot in Salonica; the German front remained impregnable\r\nin the west; the new war-cabinet, for all its dash and fire,\r\nwas \"too late\" to prevent the Russian revolution; and German\r\nsubmarine-commanders, perhaps in ignorance of the change that had\r\ntaken place, continued to sink allied and neutral shipping. No\r\nimprovement was observable until the United States entered the\r\nwar; and the warmest panegyrist of the new government has never\r\nsuggested that the credit for this decision should be given to\r\nthe new prime minister. Those who look for a single principle or\r\ndetail in which the second coalition varied the policy of the\r\nfirst are rewarded with an encomium on the blessings of a unified\r\ncommand; but official rhetoric did not conceal that the French\r\nwere being given, with much advertising display, what was waiting\r\nfor them whenever they chose to ask for it; and, if this be Mr.\r\nLloyd George's sole innovation, the assertion that he won the war\r\nstands in need of revision, the more so since the publication of\r\nthe memorandum in which Lord Milner, who was sent to \"report,\" is\r\nshewn to have carried out the unification of command on his own\r\nresponsibility and without reference to the prime minister.[57]\r\nLiberals of the rank and file, growing weary of phrases about\r\n\"instant daily decisions\" and the advantage of \"doing it now,\"\r\nover \"waiting and seeing,\" found so little improvement abroad and\r\nso much calamitous disorder at home that within six months the new\r\nmanagement seemed to have had a long enough trial: in that time\r\ncabinet rule had been abolished, nothing had been put in its place\r\nand the empire was at the mercy of half-a-dozen men who were alike\r\nonly in the distrust which they aroused. From time to time the more\r\nardent liberal skirmishers criticised the government; but their\r\nenthusiasm was damped by consistent failure to \"make the red-hats\r\ngo over the top\"; it was finally destroyed by the faint-hearted\r\nattack of their leaders when at last they called ministers to\r\naccount in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe \"Maurice Debate\" is of party importance in registering the\r\ndeath of the liberal party; it had indeed breathed its last\r\neighteen months before, but the certificate was only written when\r\nMr. Asquith was defeated on a division which challenged the honour\r\nof the prime minister and certain of his colleagues. Since the\r\nparty meeting at the Reform Club on December 8th 1916 some of the\r\nmore enterprising had snatched at office, others awaited their\r\nturn; of those who still sat on the opposition benches several\r\nwere transferring their energies to commerce; and the division\r\nlists shewed that all but a faithful ninety-nine voted with the\r\ngovernment or abstained from voting. For the next and last six\r\nmonths of the parliament's life, Mr. Lloyd George had nothing to\r\nfear in the House of Commons from the man whom he had supplanted.\r\n\r\nFollowing up his advantage, he took care in December that he should\r\nhave nothing to fear from Mr. Asquith in the country. He that was\r\nnot with the prime minister was against the man who had won the\r\nwar and who aspired now to win the peace; there was no room for\r\nindependence or qualification; a candidate went to victory with a\r\n\"coupon\" or to defeat without it. At such a time there was no lead\r\nor guidance from \"old gang\" headquarters; no alternative programme\r\nwas offered; and the bemused elector was left to imagine that the\r\nliberals who refused the \"coupon\" without putting forward a policy\r\nof their own were plotting an assassin's war against a man whom\r\nthey dared not fight openly. The coalition swept the country;\r\nthe old liberal ministers were hurled from seats which some had\r\noccupied for a generation; and, as empty benches have their value\r\nin a division, the ministerial majority was strengthened by every\r\nvacant place once filled, before the Sinn Fein landslide, by a\r\nnationalist. So complete was the rout that, when Sir Donald Maclean\r\nand his scarred following of \"Asquithian liberals\" took their\r\nseats, the labour party challenged his right to be considered the\r\nleader of the opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSince the general election a few seats have been won by \"old\r\ngang\" candidates; the liberal associations in the country have\r\ndenounced Mr. Lloyd George, his followers and all their works;\r\nand Mr. Asquith has returned to the House as member for Paisley.\r\nThe liberal party, however, is more deeply divided than ever; and\r\nan autocratic ministry has established itself so firmly that,\r\nwhile no one can defend its misgovernment, no one can shake it\r\nfrom its seat. The coalition liberals who parted from their old\r\nleader in despair or disgust cannot be detached; the party which\r\nwas so wantonly shattered cannot be reconstructed; and, while the\r\nopposition remains numerically small and impotent in all but voice,\r\nthe strange bed-fellows of the coalition cling comfortably to what\r\nthey have lest a worse fate overtake them. Efforts have been made\r\nto \"fuse\" liberals and conservatives into one permanent union;\r\nand, though the organizations outside the House refuse to blend,\r\nthe ministers within have contrived to discard the old shibboleths\r\nwhich in other days set men and parties in antagonism.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the ministry demands a moment's scrutiny. It was\r\ncomposed of liberals and conservatives, of the older statesmen and\r\nthe young, in roughly equal numbers; it included one or two men,\r\nsuch as Mr. Fisher and Sir Robert Horne, who were new to political\r\nlife and who were first-rate administrators rather than first-rate\r\nparty men: while a coalition is fortunate in being able to draw\r\nupon two sources of political talent, it is less fortunate in\r\nhaving to recognise two party debts instead of one, and Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge's second ministry contained probably more men of third-rate\r\nability than any in modern history; the experiment of giving office\r\nto \"business men\" was not an unqualified success, and before long\r\nonly Sir Eric Geddes remained in an embryonic department where\r\nhe was spared the perhaps inevitable friction that occurs when a\r\nbusiness man is brought in contact with civil servants. Labour\r\nhas withdrawn from the coalition; the Irish members, with the\r\nexception of Sir Edward Carson, never entered it. When the first\r\ncabinet was formed in 1916, two of the appointments most strongly\r\ncriticised were those of Lord Curzon and Lord Milner, who were\r\nfelt to have failed in India and South Africa respectively and to\r\nbe antagonistic to those ideals of democracy and nationalism for\r\nwhich, in theory, the war was being fought; it was added that Lord\r\nMilner was of German extraction. No one criticises them now, for\r\nnationalism and democracy have lost in public interest; but the\r\ncynic, with a recollection of former party divisions, may smile at\r\nthe spectacle of Lord Curzon of Kedleston holding office under Mr.\r\nLloyd George of Criccieth.\r\n\r\nThe government has proved itself more varied than strong; but pure\r\nconservatism, pure liberalism and pure labour have been unable to\r\norganise an alternative. The attempt to perpetuate the coalition\r\nby fusing liberals and conservatives into a \"centre party\" was\r\nperhaps given new vigour by the fear that the liberal party\r\nwould coalesce with labour. There is an engaging belief among\r\nstatisticians and poets that they are the born leaders of nascent\r\ndemocracy, and few popular movements are long secure from their\r\nhelp and guidance: at the time of the 1918 general election Mr.\r\nSidney Webb and Sir Leo Chiozza-Money staked out their claim. They\r\nwere followed by an eager rush of itinerant intellectuals who were\r\neager to sign on before a monopoly could be established. Soon a new\r\nformula was constructed for political grouping: the labour party\r\nwas to be the party of \"earned incomes,\" and the vast liberal and\r\nconservative middle-class of men and women engaged in commercial\r\nand \"professional\" work was at liberty to enter it.\r\n\r\nThough the invitation has not as yet been widely accepted, there\r\nhave been some recruits to labour, and more will no doubt come in;\r\nto the historian the interest of this projected fusion lies in the\r\nchange which it marks in political idealism. The old liberal creed\r\nwould seem to be forfeiting the sympathy of its last supporters;\r\npolitics are losing their soul; and material self-interest is being\r\nmade the touchstone of government. It was perhaps inevitable that\r\nthere should be a move in this direction at the end of a war which\r\ndisturbed the financial equilibrium of every one in the country;\r\ninevitable, too, that more altruistic counsels should have to\r\nwait for a hearing until each man had done the best for himself\r\nin the licenced scramble which economists call the \"distribution\r\nof wealth\" and the \"apportionment of taxation.\" The problems of\r\nthe future, it is urged, are economic; in England at least there\r\nis now as much personal and religious liberty as any one cares to\r\nenjoy; foreign politics only become interesting as they precipitate\r\nor avert war; and war is over for the present. In their existing\r\nstate of physical and nervous exhaustion the inarticulate millions\r\nare concerned only to attain the highest possible level of\r\npersonal comfort and to bask there with the greatest possible\r\ndegree of security. They are profoundly interested in wages and\r\nprices, but here their political interest stops short. Until it\r\nis seen whether this narrowing of political outlook is likely to\r\nbe permanent, liberals will occupy themselves more profitably in\r\nstudying it intelligently than in deploring it self-righteously.\r\nThey must recognise that for the present at least the electors are\r\nconsidering every issue in terms of money; to nationalisation of\r\nindustry they are applying the test: will it make living cheaper\r\nor dearer? So with a crusade against soviet government. So with\r\nthe imperial mission of Great Britain in Mesopotamia. So with Free\r\nTrade. So with the resumption of commercial relations with Russia.\r\nIt is only at Westminster that the nervous party organisers wonder\r\nwhether the middle classes will \"vote labour,\" whether the \"old\r\ngang\" can retain its hold on the liberal machine in the country,\r\nwhether Mr. Lloyd George can form a new party and collect funds.\r\nThe electors will vote at the prompting of their pockets. If they\r\nhave not broken down the familiar lines of party division, it is\r\nbecause they are not deceived by any talk of a party which is to\r\ncontain all the \"earned incomes\" and realise that there is no true\r\ndistinction between incomes earned or unearned; taxation falls\r\non the people with money, however acquired. They are as little\r\ndeceived by warnings about \"Bolshevism\" and suspect that it is all\r\na dodge to make their flesh creep. England, they feel, does not\r\nlove revolutions and has a blind, stupid instinct for avoiding\r\nthem; preeminently by never allowing too large a proportion of the\r\npopulation to become too hungry at the same time; prices indeed are\r\nhigh, but wages have risen to meet them; when trade has recovered\r\nafter the war, prices will fall, but wages will tend to remain\r\nconstant; the poorer classes will find themselves richer, the\r\nrich poorer; an immense economic revolution will have taken place\r\nwithout a single soviet. Every one is concerned to safeguard his\r\nown position.\r\n\r\nThough political interest in England has sunk to low-water mark in\r\none direction, it has risen alarmingly in another. The national\r\ntradition of describing parliament as a \"talking-shop\" and of\r\ndemanding machines or men who will \"_do_ something\" may indicate\r\nsome little confusion of thought among those who would make a\r\ndeliberative assembly executive, but it prepares the way for a\r\ngreat constitutional change when men discover more certain and less\r\ndilatory methods of \"doing something\" than by parliamentary means;\r\ninterest has shifted from the House of Commons to Fleet Street, to\r\nUnity House, to the periodical conferences of labour and, indeed,\r\nto any mass-meeting convened for any purpose by men or women\r\nwho are in earnest about anything. Representative government is\r\nbreaking down; direct government threatens to take its place; and\r\nthe gravest problem of domestic statesmanship is to restore faith\r\nin parliamentary institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThis temporary dislocation is no new phenomenon. The reform bill\r\nof 1867 became a serious part of the ministerial programme when a\r\nLondon mob pulled up the railings of Hyde Park: that was direct\r\npressure from below. Direct pressure from above came when Mr.\r\nGladstone appealed, over the head of some four hundred critical,\r\nangular supporters, to vast mass-meetings throughout the country;\r\ntheir verdict and sanction overrode the authority of the discreet\r\nrepresentatives who had been returned to interpret the will of\r\nthe people; representative government yielded place, on occasion,\r\nto a direct mandate, to an informal referendum: in a word, to\r\ndirect democracy. And, as democracy became articulate through the\r\npress and through public meetings, the doctrine was born that\r\nevery political change must be inaugurated by a press and popular\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIn the last six years every political revolution has been forced on\r\nthe House of Commons from outside. The constitutional passage of\r\nhome rule was checked in 1914 by a threat of military rebellion and\r\npopular violence; the suffrage was extended to women as the reward\r\nof their extra-parliamentary agitation and in the teeth of press\r\nand popular opinion; war with Bolshevist Russia was stopped by the\r\nlabour party, outside the House; and Ireland, despairing of help\r\nor leadership from England, has set up a Sinn Fein government. In\r\none form or another this is \"direct action\"; and \"direct action\" is\r\nthe _ultima ratio_ of the governed against their governors when the\r\nelected representatives slip beyond the control of their electors.\r\nThe course of legislation and of foreign politics is now determined\r\nby a series of political strikes. In 1920, the labour party tried\r\nits hand on a solution of the Irish problem. Certain railway\r\nworkers refused to carry munitions for the government. The National\r\nUnion of Railway Workers was urged to support this local strike\r\nand to declare a general strike if the government tried to run the\r\nIrish railways with the help of engineers working under military\r\ndiscipline. Here, if it had chosen to throw down the challenge,\r\norganised labour would have met and contended with the executive of\r\nrepresentative government on the highest plane. Mr. J. H. Thomas\r\nshewed the statesmanship to avert or postpone this conflict by\r\nasking the prime minister to receive a deputation to discuss an\r\nIrish settlement from the standpoint of labour.\r\n\r\nAt least for a time parliament has been superseded by the direct\r\naction of men who find themselves impotent as parliamentary\r\nelectors but powerful--perhaps, in the future, all-powerful--as\r\nthe mechanicians of the communal life. This change from\r\nconstitutionalism to direct action, from representation to control\r\nat first hand, is too grave to be ignored. As men meet primarily in\r\nhuman associations for the comforts of life, they defeat the object\r\nof their association by encouraging or condoning trials of strength\r\nwhich establish nothing but the momentary triumph of the moment's\r\nvictor; what has been secured by the railway strike of 1919 beyond\r\nthe knowledge that the railwaymen can to a great extent paralyse\r\nthe activity of the country and that the rest of the community\r\ncan to a great extent improvise means and services for preventing\r\ncomplete paralysis?\r\n\r\nIt is more than time alike for employers and employed to realise\r\nthat they are the servants of the public: as every strike comes to\r\nan end at some time and on some terms, there is no reason in equity\r\nwhy a strike should ever begin; if the individual submits--and\r\ncheerfully submits--his honour, life and fortune to the arbitrament\r\nof a judge and jury, every man or body of men who will not\r\nsubmit an industrial dispute to a similar tribunal is suspected\r\nof having discarded equity in favour of the doctrine that might,\r\nhowever temporary, is right. Employers and employed will only win\r\npublic sympathy, if indeed they care to have it, when they agree\r\nto compulsory arbitration backed by the severest penalties for\r\nbreach of agreement; the status of both is at present that of a\r\nrobber-baron. It is more than time, too, for masters and men in any\r\none industry to realise that they represent but a small proportion\r\nof the organised capital and labour in the country, a yet smaller\r\nproportion of the total life and wealth of the community.\r\n\r\nMore needful even than the divorce between militant politics and\r\nmilitant economics is the reestablishment of public order.\r\n\r\nAs the policeman is a symbol, as organised society depends far less\r\non the executive officers of the law than on respect for the law,\r\nnothing but chaos can be expected of any successful resistance to\r\nlaw. When the law-breaker goes not only unpunished but rewarded\r\nand honoured, can it be expected that others will not follow\r\nin the footsteps of those who have risen by anarchy to be lord\r\nchancellor, lord of appeal, chancellor of the exchequer and leader\r\nof the Ulster party? The privy councillor who preaches and prepares\r\narmed resistance to law, the suffragette who breaks a window, the\r\nemployer or the workman who breaks a contract, the conscientious\r\nobjector who repudiates any liability that the soveran government\r\nmay impose upon him is a danger, by contact and example, to the\r\nwhole state, a mad dog whose extirpation is the first duty of all\r\nwho value the stability of the state. Here, as everywhere, popular\r\njudgement is warped by social and intellectual snobbishness: the\r\n\"passive resister,\" whose \"nonconformist conscience\" forbade his\r\npaying rates for the support of Church of England teaching was an\r\nobject of impatient scorn; the lady of rank who declined to lick\r\ninsurance-stamps at the bidding of a little Welsh attorney was\r\na woman of pride and independence; the officers who threatened\r\nmutiny and the civilians who took up arms against home rule\r\nwere regarded as heroes; but the men who preferred prisons and\r\nobloquy to the necessity of trying to take the life of their\r\ncountry's enemies were branded as traitors and cowards. There can\r\nonly be one equitable rule: so long as a man remains a member\r\nof any community--nation, church, profession or club--he must\r\nsubmit scrupulously to its rules and only seek to change them by\r\nconstitutional means.\r\n\r\nBut, inasmuch as constitutional government is the art of\r\nunderstanding and coordinating to a common end human beings who\r\nare at once above and below the mute, mechanical conscripts of an\r\nautocracy, the governors have to make obedience easy by making\r\ngovernment human. In the twentieth century man is too imaginative\r\nand too little servile to worship the inexorable soveranty of\r\nHobbes' _Leviathan_. Men and women will submit still to starvation,\r\ntorture and death rather than compromise with an ideal: it is\r\ndoubtful citizenship, but it is a psychological problem to be faced\r\nand solved; it is best solved by preventing the martyr's high,\r\ntragic sense of desperation and by facilitating the methods of\r\nconstitutional redress. Direct action is a final protest when the\r\nways of constitutionalism are blocked; in Russia, in Ireland, in\r\nEgypt and India, the man with a grievance has been driven back on\r\nthe bomb remedy. England dislikes sporadic violence as much as\r\ngeneral revolution: bombs are unlikely to be thrown in England,\r\nbut the political strike will take their place as an alternative\r\nto the methods of representative government unless these methods\r\ncan be made more sensitive to opinion. First the mode of election\r\nmust be so changed that a minority candidate no longer slips into\r\nparliament over the struggling forms of his majority rivals; then\r\nthe life of parliament must be so shortened that a member can be\r\ncalled to more frequent account; and lastly the constituency must\r\nhave power to demand of its member that he submit himself for\r\nreelection when he is acting against its wishes. The representative\r\nmust, in other words, become more and more the deputy. Such a\r\ndevelopment would have brought consternation to the heart of\r\nEdmund Burke; but it is the only alternative, in a press-ridden,\r\npublicity-ruled state, to direct action.\r\n\r\nThese are the mechanics of politics, the fundamentals governing\r\nthe relations of ruler and ruled in all states at all times.\r\nPolitics--in the sense of a conflict between parties organised in\r\nobedience to common principles and in pursuit of common aims--have\r\nlately been shelved. Now--as always--the king's government must\r\nbe carried on; now--for the first time--it must be carried on by\r\nthe king's present ministers. To secure that consummation, the\r\nunbending partisans of other days have sunk their differences: Mr.\r\nLloyd George and Lord Curzon, Mr. Churchill and Lord Birkenhead,\r\nMr. Montagu and Mr. Balfour work side by side; though liberal and\r\nconservative stalwarts retain enough of the old spirit to assure\r\ntheir constituents that they would resign if a sacrilegious finger\r\nwere laid on their cardinal principles, by luck, contrivance or\r\nthe requirements of the moment Mr. Lloyd George has been able to\r\navoid such controversial legislation as might split his ministry;\r\nand, where legislation threatened to become controversial, as in\r\nthe latest home rule bill, the greatest living conciliator found\r\na means of accommodating minor differences until a united cabinet\r\nrecognised the absurdity of resigning office.\r\n\r\nThough every government falls more or less unexpectedly, there\r\nis no reason why the present one should not continue until its\r\nleaders judge the moment to be ripe for an election. A ministry is\r\nupset by opposition within the House or outside; the coalition has\r\nno organised opposition to fear beyond the \"wee free\" liberals,\r\nwho are numerically unimportant, and the labour party, which is\r\nnot yet ready to take control. Coalition liberals and coalition\r\nconservatives have at least one foot firmly planted in the\r\npromised land; before they try to plant the second foot, they\r\nhave to remember Aesop's fable of the dog that snapped at the\r\nreflection of his own piece of meat. Outside the House there is\r\nplenty of criticism, plenty of opposition; but, though a little of\r\nthe criticism becomes fruitful through the urgency of the press,\r\nthere is no visible alternative government, no one wants a general\r\nelection, and the public is bored with politics. The warning which\r\nCharles II gave to his ambitious brother might be quoted by any\r\nminister to any critic who wished to supplant him.\r\n\r\nSomething as great as the war in its comprehensive, intimate\r\nattack on every member of the community will be required to\r\nreawaken general interest in politics: when Great Britain is even\r\nnearer bankruptcy and starvation, when the United States refuse\r\nher credit, when the world shortage of food affects the stomachs\r\nof the world and the hungry, maddened hordes of central and\r\neastern Europe break raveningly forth, it may be remembered that\r\nthe misrule of the present government has an exact parallel, on a\r\nsmaller scale, in the misrule of Louis XVI's ministers before the\r\nFrench revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the 1918 election the prime minister expressed his\r\npolitical ideal in the formula that England had to be made a home\r\nfit for heroes. How far he has realised this ideal in the years\r\nduring which he has ruled the House of Commons without opposition\r\nis a question which the heroes themselves are best qualified to\r\nanswer; but, exalted as was his vision, some may still feel that,\r\nsince England contains men and women of most unheroic stature and\r\nis but a part of the inhabited world, his formula was inadequate.\r\nThe young men of the generation which this book has attempted to\r\ndescribe were, from the first awakening of their intelligence,\r\nexercised over the function of government and divided over its\r\naim by the political philosophy which they hammered out for\r\nthemselves in reading and discussion. From different angles\r\nand by different paths they reached agreement on the postulate\r\nthat, before all else, every man should have secured to him the\r\nminimum of essentials. He could not claim food, air and warmth\r\nof natural \"right\", for in organised society a man enjoys only\r\nthose rights which his fellow-men allow him; but the communists\r\naccorded them as a payment on account, and the individualists as\r\nan insurance against revolution. Those who fought shy of party\r\nlabels and regarded themselves as having been born fortuitously\r\nand without consultation into a world from which there was no\r\nescape but by death felt that they had every inducement to live,\r\nby mutual consideration, on the best possible terms with their\r\nfellows and that life would be intolerable if a neighbour rifled\r\ntheir pockets as they slept or broke their heads if they snored.\r\nThose who gloried in the name of liberals and believed that the\r\nend of life was the attainment of beauty included in their minimum\r\nthe claim that each man should have secured to him the chance of\r\nmaking his own life beautiful. With generosity not yet tarnished by\r\nexperience and with hatred of injustice not yet tempered by custom,\r\nthese young men felt that they could not be wholly comfortable\r\nwhile others were uncomfortable: the cries of the suffering might\r\nbanish sleep, their desperation might threaten security; if they\r\nobtruded it, as they were so tastelessly prone to do, their misery\r\nmight disquiet an over-active conscience. Policy joined hands with\r\nhumanity in favour of giving every one his minimum of essentials.\r\n\r\nIt had not been given when the war put an end to dreaming. It\r\nhas not been given yet. It will not be fully given until a man\r\nis secure from disease and premature death; from pain, hunger,\r\nthirst and cold; from spiritual and intellectual fear; from terror\r\nof his fellow-man; from the educational inequality that sets him\r\nat a disadvantage with others; from the grievance that comes of\r\na blow struck to his racial or religious sentiment. Twenty years\r\nago, before they discovered the limitations of official politics,\r\nyoung liberals found from the contemplation of those ideals a\r\nvocation: they believed in equality of opportunity and swore by\r\nbetter housing, better feeding, better education; they sympathised\r\nwith the aspirations of nationality half a generation before these\r\nwere discovered and forgotten by the rest of England; they were\r\ndisturbed by the thought that men were flogged to death in the\r\nBelgian Congo or massacred in Armenia; and, maybe, they wearied the\r\ncomplacent with statistics of all those who in a single year and\r\nin the richest country in the world died of cancer and consumption\r\nor rotted away with syphilis. The verminous, rickety child seemed\r\nno less a blot on civilisation than the short-lived prostitute\r\nwho--they were assured--was irreclaimable, \"because that sort of\r\nthing always _has_ gone on; it's the oldest profession in the\r\nworld; and, of course, it _is_ a safety-valve....\"\r\n\r\nTwenty years of work and travel, twenty years of mingling with\r\naverage, sensual men and women, twenty years' experience of inertia\r\nmay have cured young liberals of their optimism, but it should have\r\nstrengthened their faith. By now they have probably seen much of\r\nwhat, before, was made known to them only from books: they have\r\nwalked through factories and seen girls turned into machines by\r\nthe monotonous repetition of one part of one process; they have\r\nlooked, over the side of a liner, at straining, black, half-naked\r\nmen who have already been turned into the semblance of shuffling,\r\ndebased animals by the monotony of carrying coal; they are assured,\r\nperhaps, that industrial conditions are better in England than\r\nanywhere else, but they still wonder what life and what vision\r\nof beauty are possible to these slaves of the work-room and of\r\nthe coal-lighter, who are not the less slaves because they enjoy\r\nfreedom to move from one master to another. Sheltered indeed must\r\nbe the life of any who have not found, in twenty years, a daily\r\nvent for the compassion which is the living breath of liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe communist who seeks to abolish private property has more\r\nchance of success than the impatient reformer who tries to sweep\r\naway all the ugliness of modern life by breaking the mechanism on\r\nwhich modern life with its ugliness and its beauty depends. It\r\nis too late to make an end of industrialism; and man was harder\r\nused and more brutalised before the advent of machinery than ever\r\nsince. His lot is improving daily; and all that the reformer can\r\nreasonably ask is that the rate of improvement shall be accelerated\r\nuntil the employer of labour no longer imposes on his work-people\r\nconditions that he would himself refuse. In war, a British officer\r\ndoes not order his men into an action which he is himself afraid\r\nto undertake; at the end of a march, he does not think of his own\r\nneeds until he has seen that his men have their food. There is\r\nsomething perilously like shirking in the attitude of an employer\r\nwho expects men and women to undertake hardships from which he\r\nstands aloof; and, directly or indirectly, all are employers.\r\n\r\nThe mission of liberalism will not be fulfilled until it has\r\nachieved a form of civilisation whereof no part can inspire\r\nmisgiving or shame. Every country has its dark places; the\r\ninhabitants of every country turn a blind eye to them until the\r\nupheaval of war, the outbreak of revolution or the spread of a new\r\nfaith throws a challenge to every social institution and demands\r\nthat it shall justify itself. When more than five million men\r\nvoluntarily risked their lives in defence of one system against\r\nanother, their decision was less a clean-cut choice than a blend\r\nof herd-instinct, collective hypnotism and that irrational feeling\r\nfor associations which is called patriotism; the decision once\r\ntaken, they committed themselves to a struggle in which one order\r\nof civilisation would probably maintain itself and another would\r\nprobably be overthrown. If they preserved that which was less good\r\nand destroyed that which was more good, they sinned against the\r\nlight; if they preserved that which was more good, they were still\r\nobliged to prove it so much the better that no sacrifice was too\r\ngreat for it; and, if in their scrutiny they discovered blemishes,\r\nthey were bound to remove them for fear the enemy would say that\r\nthey had sacrificed themselves for something that was not worth\r\ntheir lives. During the war, of course, every one was too busy to\r\nhunt for blemishes and to remove them.\r\n\r\nAfter the war every one is too busy; and those who once called\r\nthemselves liberals have lost interest in everything but the\r\ncost of living, though the youngest of them can recall the days\r\nwhen the present prime minister's voice throbbed with emotion in\r\ndescribing the misery of the poor and in championing the outcasts\r\nof civilisation, wherever they were to be found.\r\n\r\nIt is more than time for the young liberals of twenty years ago to\r\nrecognise that the liberal faith has lost its prophets and that the\r\nprophets have lost their liberal faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA MEMORY RETOUCHED\r\n\r\n\r\n  The nineteenth wave of the ages rolls\r\n      Now deathward since thy death and birth.\r\n  Hast thou fed full men's starved-out souls?\r\n      Hast thou brought freedom upon earth?\r\n  Or are there less oppressions done\r\n  In this wild world under the sun?\r\n\r\n  Nay, if indeed thou be not dead,\r\n      Before thy terrene shrine be shaken,\r\n  Look down, turn usward, bow thine head;\r\n      O thou that wast of God forsaken,\r\n  Look on thine household here, and see\r\n  Those that have not forsaken thee.\r\n\r\n                             A. C. SWINBURNE: _Before a Crucifix_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNearly twelve months after the treaty of peace with Germany had\r\nbeen signed, a few of the men who had gone down from Oxford ten\r\nor twelve years before met again at their annual college gaudy.\r\nIt may be not superfluous to explain that all masters of arts who\r\nhave kept their names on the books are invited in rotation, in the\r\nsecond half of June, to the commemoration ceremony, to dinner in\r\nhall, to a service next day and to breakfast in hall. From 1914 to\r\n1918 the gaudies were discontinued; and 1920 provided the first\r\noccasion on which the men who had taken their M.A. degrees in the\r\nyears immediately prior to the war received an invitation.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that they clambered into their hansoms, men\r\nwho had not seen one another for ten years lapsed into a world\r\nwhich they had known as undergraduates in the last days of King\r\nEdward's reign. They had come together from India and Africa:\r\nclergymen, civil servants and officials of the Woods and Forests;\r\nwith or without lasting injury, they had survived the war on one\r\nof its many fronts; some had grown rich, some had married and\r\nbegotten children; some had remained as materially unchanged as\r\nthey were unchanged in appearance; and, after a longer or shorter\r\nOdyssey of adventure, all were now settled to their work in life.\r\nAutomatically they disinterred forgotten nicknames, and the\r\nfirst of all seemed to cast a spell upon them and to revive the\r\natmosphere of the last night of their last term. The awnings and\r\nsupper-tent lingered on as a reminder of Commemoration; ornate\r\nyoung men hurried through Tom Quad to the last ball of the week,\r\nleaden-footed young men limped to the bathrooms next day as their\r\nseniors made ready for prayers in the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nTen years before, a world to which their schools and universities\r\nwere but a window lay before a disintegrating Oxford generation;\r\nand on its youth and enthusiasm, in an age which aspired to keep\r\nsoul and body in hard condition, depended the mark that each member\r\nmade in it. Half unconsciously, the young men of that epoch were\r\nreacting to that epoch's literary fervour of humanity and rational\r\norder: Galsworthy was teaching them that life should be gentle,\r\nWells that it should be tidy, Shaw that it should be ascetic. That\r\nwas the open noon of their idealism; those seemed the brave days\r\nfor men of democratic faith.\r\n\r\nIn little more than the hundred years which ended with Queen\r\nVictoria's death an humane spirit of liberalism, not confined to a\r\nsingle country, had forbidden torture and abolished slavery; it had\r\nachieved political emancipation and religious toleration; in making\r\nthe whole of a community responsible for each part, it was slowly\r\ninculcating an idea of fraternity; and, in asserting public right\r\nbetween nations, it was beginning to merge in that universal spirit\r\nwhich at intervals of many centuries shines through the world and\r\nteaches men to regard mankind as one whole: the constant spirit of\r\nBuddha, of Christ and of Tolstoi, the transitory half-understood\r\ndream of Alexander and of Napoleon. The trend of history seemed,\r\nin those days, to be a term interchangeable with the progress of\r\nliberalism; whatever stood in its way seemed destined to fight a\r\nlosing battle; and the hope of the future was rooted in the record\r\nof the past. Every difficulty that for a moment seemed insuperable\r\nwas matched by some old and seemingly insuperable difficulty which\r\nhad been overcome: if old age, lazy and without vision, predicted\r\nthat there must always be violence and injustice, youth could\r\nretort that injustice and violence were diminishing daily; if war\r\ncontinued, duelling in England had at least been abolished; if the\r\nmodern sportsman fired broadsides into a cloud of driven birds, he\r\nwas at least denied, and perhaps disinclined for, the pleasures of\r\ncock-fighting. Life, until 1914, was sacred; and the conditions\r\nunder which life was carried on were becoming no less important\r\nthan life itself.\r\n\r\nThe young liberals of those days, taught to feel that every human\r\nbeing must have a chance, through freedom, of attaining happiness,\r\nbelieved in their cause and in their leaders; through the pitched\r\nbattles of the next four years their faith was undimmed. More than\r\nthis dumb allegiance it was not yet easy for them to give: still\r\nlittle more than boys, most of them had careers to make before they\r\ncould participate actively in politics. Later, as a few of them\r\nwere ready to take their place in the line, a more urgent war burst\r\nupon them; democracy at home had to be left to take care of itself,\r\nthough in August 1914 they hoped and expected their local democracy\r\nwould be caught up in a greater democracy; they believed then\r\nthat \"a war to end war\" would prepare the way for ultimate human\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nWas it so fantastic a dream? In 1914 less than one hundred and\r\nseventy years had passed since the last civil war in which\r\nEnglishmen fought against Englishmen on British soil; now England\r\nwas consolidated and uniform. Might there not soon be a time\r\nwhen Europe, disarmed and controlled by an international police,\r\nwould be so far uniform and consolidated that war between any of\r\nits component states would be no less unthinkable than war in\r\nEngland between Lancashire and Cornwall? Until Ireland was driven\r\nto anarchy, the common conscience of Great Britain refused to\r\ntolerate disorder and free shooting; might there not be a time when\r\nthe common conscience of Europe refused to tolerate periodical\r\nmassacres? In 1914, though perforce their grip slackened on the\r\nreforms nearer at hand, the souls of the young men were touched for\r\na moment by the universal spirit.\r\n\r\nFor the survivors who paced the quadrangles after dinner, peering\r\nat the familiar staircases and glancing up at the silent windows,\r\nevery comer of the college was haunted by some one who would never\r\nsee Oxford again. In 1910 very few believed that a European\r\nwar was necessary; very many still believe that even by 1910 a\r\ndifferent and more honest diplomacy could have averted it. In 1914,\r\nwhen war broke out, it was fancied that those who were offering\r\ntheir lives would be rewarded everlasting freedom from the fear of\r\nanother war; could that still be fancied in 1920? It was felt and\r\nsaid, too, that, as these men were venturing all for one corner of\r\nthe earth, they--if they came back--or their survivors should find\r\nit so swept and garnished that they would know they had ventured to\r\ngood purpose. Oxford is still the kingdom of youth, and idealism\r\nstill flourishes in its shelter; but, when the gathering speed of\r\nthe London train cut short the last glimpse of Tom Tower and of\r\nthe cathedral spire, it was not easy to feel that the sweeping and\r\ngarnishing were complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\"Whoever attempts to forecast the course systems of government\r\nwill take,\" wrote Lord Bryce in _Modern Democracies_, \"must ...\r\nbegin from the two propositions that the only thing we know about\r\nthe Future is that it will differ from the Past, and, that the\r\nonly data we have for conjecturing what the Future may possibly\r\nbring with it are drawn from observations of the Past, or, in\r\nother words, from that study of the tendencies of human nature\r\nwhich gives ground for expecting from men certain kinds of action\r\nin certain states of fact. We cannot refrain from conjecture. Yet\r\nto realise how vain conjectures are, let us imagine ourselves to\r\nbe in the place of those who only three or four generations ago\r\nfailed to forecast what the next following generation would see.\r\nLet us suppose Burke, Johnson, and Gibbon sitting together at a\r\ndinner of The Club in 1769, the year when Napoleon and Wellington\r\nwere born, and the talk falling on the politics of the European\r\nContinent. Did they have any presage of the future? The causes\r\nwhence the American Revolution and the French Revolution were to\r\nspring, and which would break the sleep of the people in Germany\r\nand Italy, might, one would think, have already been discerned by\r\nthree such penetrating observers, but the only remarks most of us\r\nrecall as made then and for some years afterwards to note symptoms\r\nof coming dangers were made by a French traveller, who said that\r\nthe extinction of French power in Canada had weakened the tie\r\nbetween the American colonies and Great Britain, and by an English\r\ntraveller who saw signs of rottenness in the French Monarchy. Men\r\nstood on the edge of stupendous changes, not discerning the causes\r\nthat were already in embryo beneath their feet, like seeds hidden\r\nunder the snow of winter, which will shoot up under the April\r\nsunlight. How much more difficult has it now become to diagnose\r\nthe symptoms of an age in which the interplay of economic forces,\r\nintellectual forces, moral and religious forces is more complex\r\nthan ever heretofore, incomparably more complex than it had seemed\r\nto be before discovery had gone far in the spheres of chemistry,\r\nphysics, and biology, before education had been diffused through\r\nall classes, before every part of the world had been drawn into\r\nrelations with every other part so close that what affects one must\r\naffect the rest.\"\r\n\r\nIn ten years the men who hoped to beautify the world through the\r\nagency of politics had learned something of parliament and of\r\nits limitations; it is not the perfect instrument for a social\r\nreformation or a spiritual revival; such vain imaginings revealed\r\nthe reformers' folly or at least their youth, but they were misled\r\nby the resonant beatitudes of public speeches. Parliament and the\r\nwhole machine of government are, by their remoteness from the\r\npublic life of the nation, always a little loftier in temper than\r\nthe basest elements of the population: the House of Commons may be\r\nblind, greedy, vindictive or persecuting, but at such moments it\r\nis never so persecuting or vindictive, so greedy or blind as an\r\nincensed mob would like it to be. On the other hand, parliament\r\nand the whole machine of government never, in their most exalted\r\nmoments, attain such a nobility of soul as the mob outside achieves\r\nin its disinterested moods. From the first day of war to the last\r\nand for all their lapses into panic and madness, the uninstructed\r\nsilent masses were prompt in every crisis with more patience and\r\nfortitude, more philosophy and more capacity for sacrifice than\r\nparliament knew how to use. It is not through the House of Commons\r\nthat England will be made a home for heroes.\r\n\r\n\"We had no conception of the quality of politics,\" wrote Wells of\r\none character then aged fifteen, \"nor how 'interests' came into\r\nsuch affairs; we believed men were swayed by purely intellectual\r\nconvictions and were either right or wrong, honest or dishonest\r\n(in which case they deserved to be shot), good or bad. We knew\r\nnothing of mental inertia, and could imagine the opinion of a\r\nwhole nation changed by one lucid and convincing exposition....\r\nWe rebuilt London by Act of Parliament, and once in a mood of\r\nhygienic enterprise we transferred its population _en masse_ to the\r\nNorth Downs by an order of the Local Government Board. We thought\r\nnothing of throwing religious organisations out of employment or\r\nsuperseding all the newspapers by freely distributed bulletins.\r\nWe could contemplate the possibility of laws abolishing whole\r\nclasses; we were equal to such a dream as the peaceful and orderly\r\nproclamation of Communism from the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral,\r\nafter the passing of a simply worded bill,--a close and not\r\nunnaturally an exciting division carrying the third reading....\r\nWe were not fools; it was simply that as yet we had gathered no\r\nexperience at all of the limits and powers of legislation and\r\nconscious collective intention....\"\r\n\r\nAt one-or two-and-twenty the \"mental inertia\" of their conservative\r\nopponents had discouraged the reformers from thinking that the more\r\ndrastic and dramatic methods of the French Revolution could be\r\napplied to British legislation in 1910; of the entire efficacy of\r\nlegislation no doubt was entertained. Everything, it was believed\r\n(and the liberal majority of 1906 believed it too), could be done\r\nby means of a simply worded bill; all that a reformer needed was\r\nthose sure voters who would carry the third reading after \"a close\r\nand not unnaturally an exciting division\"; and they were to be\r\nfound in Scotland and Wales, in the north of England and every\r\nother liberal stronghold not yet seduced by factious, independent\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nIn London, it was soon discovered, there was no help to be expected\r\nsave in the poor fringe of Camberwell and Hornsey, Stratford and\r\nBattersea; the liberal oratory of the period taught that dukes and\r\nslum-landlords were identical; and the young liberal was convinced\r\nin those days that the London he knew was vehemently opposed to\r\nall amelioration of social conditions. If, later, he found that\r\nthe most tory element in society had no greater liking than he for\r\ndirt, disease, crime, misery and hunger, he found, too, that the\r\nworld in which his lot was cast for the next ten years was too\r\nbusily engaged to spare anything but mental inertia for social\r\nreform. Its members displayed no ill-will; they subscribed hundreds\r\nof thousands every year to charity, they worked like slaves for the\r\nobjects in which their interest had been aroused; but they did not\r\nsee and they would not be made to see that Europe was an extension\r\nof England, that England was an extension of the village at their\r\nlodge-gates and that they were acquiescing in conditions of want\r\nand suffering, vice and crime which for very shame they would not\r\nallow among their own tenants.\r\n\r\nIn the course of those ten years young liberals often wondered\r\nwhat daily spur could be applied to imaginations and consciences\r\nwhich are active enough when once the spur has been applied.\r\nThe work done for the relief of suffering is immense; the sums\r\nsubscribed to charity are enormous; and yet by any standard they\r\nare insufficient. For want of a better postulate the reformers\r\nwere agreed that it was incumbent on the state for every man and\r\nwoman to be secured at least the minimum of essentials; in the\r\nsearch for a first principle of private conduct they would not have\r\nrefused the criterion whether an act would increase or decrease,\r\nin any form or any degree, the world's total of unhappiness. To an\r\nagnostic, the value of Christian ethics lay less in the protection\r\nwhich they secured to the weak than in the chivalry which they\r\ndemanded of the strong; and, if the mentally inert began with a\r\ntest even so rudimentary as this, they might progress to a frame\r\nof mind in which a man would be pulled up short by the fear, that,\r\nwhatever the gain to others, his act would cause pain to a single\r\nliving creature.\r\n\r\nPain of heart, pain of mind and pain of body are within the\r\nexperience of all; the desire to escape it is older and stronger\r\neven than the desire to attain pleasure. And directly or\r\nindirectly, by implication, or expression, the most generous and\r\nhumane men and women are daily adding to the world's suffering or\r\nare consenting to leave it unreduced. If the war could not inspire\r\na consecration of life and a crusade for the extirpation of pain,\r\nwhat other spur can avail to rouse this somnolent collective\r\nconscience? Certain streets in every great city are thronged at\r\ncertain hours with the women whom patronage calls \"unfortunate\" and\r\nsuperiority dubs \"fallen\"; the benevolent societies which exist to\r\n\"reclaim\" them succeed as well as a gardener who tries to give back\r\nits lost bloom to a rose. In misery of soul and suffering of body,\r\nevery prostitute adds to the world's total of pain; but no woman\r\ncan become a prostitute without the help of a man.\r\n\r\nHere is a fate from which every man would save his mother, his\r\nsister and his daughter; to a slumbering conscience, other men's\r\nsisters and daughters do not matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the last ten years, all those who find in mental inertia the\r\nchief obstacle to progress have been forced to enquire what does\r\nmatter to the men and women whom they have been meeting. With\r\ncomparatively few exceptions these people are temperate, kindly\r\nand faithful within conventional limits; they are as honourable\r\nand veracious as they are expected to be; almost without exception\r\nthey are physically courageous, though they have little moral and\r\nless intellectual courage; they have a sluggish pride and hardly\r\nany dignity; they have great energy and resource, versatility\r\nand endurance; many have charm, most have ability and some\r\nhave brilliance. A feudal aristocracy leavened by commerce has\r\nproduced a society of men and women whom an alien may, with\r\nadmiring detachment, consider the finest raw material for any\r\nhuman enterprise in any part of the world. No nation scored as\r\nhigh a total in as many different tests during the war. Before\r\n1914, indeed, it seemed as if this incomparable human material was\r\nrunning to waste; since 1919 it seems to be running to waste again.\r\nThe war shewed that in an emergency there was no less available\r\nsupply of courage and endurance, of self-sacrifice and ability than\r\never before; these qualities are still there if any knew how to\r\nrouse them; but it seems that, though the English will always train\r\nfor a race, they will not at other times keep themselves in even\r\nmoderately good condition.\r\n\r\nIn the reaction from the war nothing seems to matter. The _argot_\r\nof London varies from week to week, like the style of dressing\r\nand dancing; but the atmosphere is the same, the restlessness is\r\nthe same, the mad striving after effect is the same, the want\r\nof purpose is the same; and it may be doubted whether the money\r\nand energy demanded of such a life are justified by the tepid,\r\nflat pleasure which they purchase. In ten years London has become\r\nsteadily and uncaringly more greedy and vulgar. Breeding is a\r\nmemory of childhood; manners grew blunt and were discarded during\r\nthe years between the South African war and 1914; happiness has\r\nbeen lost to view in the hunt for distraction; and success is\r\nmeasured, arithmetically, by invitations.\r\n\r\n\"Queer place,\" Mr. Jingle said of Rochester. \"Dock-yard people of\r\nupper rank don't know Dock-yard people of lower rank--Dock-yard\r\npeople of lower rank don't know small gentry--small gentry don't\r\nknow tradespeople--Commissioner don't know anybody.\"\r\n\r\nLondon, it has been suggested, is less exclusive; and the only\r\nperson who is in serious danger of not being received is the\r\nman who is detected cheating at cards. For all this facile\r\naccessibility, however, the tradespeople cannot expect to visit\r\nthe small gentry without effort and assiduity. Before the war,\r\nsince the war and despite the harrowing preoccupation with war's\r\nintensest crisis, a busy army of soft-voiced, watchful women have\r\nplied their unflagging trade of \"getting to know people\"; in wealth\r\nor in rank, in charm or in notoriety, in a combination of all or\r\nany, there is always some one to be found on a slightly higher\r\nplane, there is always one greater eminence from which exclusion\r\nis synonymous with disgrace: to cross the threshold they will fawn\r\non those whom they despise and accept favours from those whom they\r\ndetest. Among men the vice is confined to the very young, the mean,\r\nthe vain and the insufficient; women are afflicted more widely and\r\ndeeply, for they feel their value depreciated when an invitation\r\npasses them by. In the words of 'Algernon Moncrieff,' \"Nothing\r\nannoys people so much as not receiving invitations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA few of the passing generation have retained their vision; many\r\nmore have acquired a new vision from the heart-searching of war.\r\nThe conscious striving after beauty and the gift of laughter\r\nalone differentiate man from the beasts; and to these few the\r\nattainment of beauty still matters here and elsewhere. London is\r\nstill the greatest city of the world; it is no less true than in\r\nDr. Johnson's day that, when a man is tired of London, he is tired\r\nof life; but it is difficult for any one who has lived for thirty\r\nyears in its midst to look patiently on while the lessons of the\r\nwar are forgotten and the debt owing to all who died in the war is\r\nrepudiated. This lapse into futility is, perhaps, only a temporary\r\nreaction from the war; no man, thinking otherwise, would want to\r\ngo on living, for in little more than thirty years the generation\r\nof which the time has now come to take leave has lost the greater\r\npart of those things which it valued. For a few, their country has\r\nbeen handed over to the blind violence and madness of anarchy; for\r\nmore, their political idols have been flung on their faces; for\r\nall, their relations and friends have died in scores. The world of\r\nthe survivors, like that corner of it in which they assembled at\r\nOxford, is peopled with shades; the mood of the survivors is that\r\nof H. W. Garrod, when he wrote his _Intruders_.\r\n\r\n  \"One day, I knew, it had to be:\r\n  Sooner or later I must see\r\n  Another race of men invade\r\n  Rooms which the men I knew had made,\r\n  With books, with pictures on the wall,\r\n  With pipes and caps, with bat or ball,\r\n  Obscurely individual.\r\n  I hate your steps upon the stair,\r\n  Your vacant voices on the air ...\r\n  I hate your chatter overhead.\r\n  And your jests that fall like lead\r\n  Where only golden things were said\r\n  By the men that are dead, the men that are dead.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not a mood of resignation or acquiescence, but of resolution,\r\nhope and preparation to pay a debt and to take up, with hands\r\nhowsoever much enfeebled and reduced, the task left unfinished \"by\r\nthe men that are dead.\" \"The blood of the martyrs is the seed of\r\nthe church\"; and, unless that seed bring forth a spirit of peace\r\nabroad and of community at home, the blood will have been spilled\r\nto no purpose. The survivors of this decimated generation have to\r\nresist, to control or to convert the languid fatalists who would\r\ndrift helplessly and hopelessly into revolution or into another\r\nwar; they have to subdue and to convince the anarchist of Hyde\r\nPark and of Park Lane, to drive \"blood-sucker\" from the lips of\r\nthe one and \"Bolshevist\" from the lips of the other, to mitigate\r\nthe credulity alike of those who find Russian gold in the pocket\r\nof every opponent and of those who scent in all opposition a plot\r\nfor enslaving the proletariat. In a country that has endured,\r\nbleeding but alive, after four years and three months of fighting,\r\nthere must be no talk of class-wars: and it must be realised that\r\nthe miscreant who bases political salvation on the lamp-posts of\r\nWhitehall is own brother to the miscreant who would win economic\r\npeace by shooting strike-leaders. If the war has not made of the\r\nEnglish, at least, a united people, the task lies ready to the hand\r\nof those liberals who have survived it; if they lack a leader, it\r\nis only for a moment.\r\n\r\nOne movement is ended. An _intermezzo_ is playing, perhaps is\r\nalready drawing to a close. Soon the new movement will begin.\r\n\r\n      \"This world has been harsh and strange;\r\n  Something is wrong: there needeth a change.\r\n  But what, or where? at the last or first?\r\n  In one point only we sinned, at worst.\r\n  The Lord will have mercy on Jacob yet,\r\n  And again in his border see Israel set.\r\n  When Judah beholds Jerusalem,\r\n  The stranger-seed shall be joined to them.\r\n  To Jacob's House shall the Gentiles cleave,\r\n  So the Prophet saith and his sons believe.\r\n  Ay, the children of the chosen race\r\n  Shall carry and bring them to their place:\r\n  In the land of the Lord shall lead the same,\r\n  Bondsmen and handmaids....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Once when Charles II visited Westminster, Busby, the head\r\nmaster, conducted him into school without uncovering: it would\r\nnever do, he explained, for the boys to think that there was any\r\none greater than himself. When the present king attended the\r\npancake greeze, Dr. Gow related this story; the king at once\r\ncommanded him to resume his cap.\r\n\r\n[2] _Mon. Stat._, for _Monitor Stationis_.\r\n\r\n[3] A contraction for \"_Volsci_\", the enemies of the \"Romans\",\r\n_i.e._, the Westminsters of many generations ago.\r\n\r\n[4] In such histories of intellectual development as I have\r\nread, too little attention is paid to the dates at which certain\r\ncopyrights have expired and the other dates at which \"popular\r\neditions\" have been issued. Cheap printing, often aided by this\r\nnew freedom to print, made available to the boys of my generation\r\na vast literature of history, biology, politics, economics and\r\ntheology. Darwin, Huxley, J. S. Mill and Carlyle were but a few of\r\nthose who lay at our disposal.\r\n\r\n[5] Until Irish and English cease to put their trust in allegorical\r\ncaricatures, there can be no sympathetic understanding between\r\nthem. Mr. Max Beerbohm has written of the disillusion which he\r\nsustained on finding that all bishops were not as Du Maurier had\r\ndrawn them for _Punch_; and it seems to be a natural failing\r\nof the English to see themselves and others in the terms of a\r\nTenniel cartoon. Until the war, every German was blonde, fat, mild\r\nand spectacled, with an equal love for sausages, beer, music,\r\nmetaphysics and a long, china-bowled pipe; the Frenchman, in\r\nconical tall-hat, loose tie and peg-top trousers, was excitable\r\nand gesticulatory, but polite and--after the _entente_ and\r\nbefore the arrival of Carpentier--a man of whom much might be\r\nmade if he could be interested in field sports. The American,\r\nthin, tall and chin-bearded, with fob-pockets and straps to his\r\ntrousers, was pregnantly deliberate in the artlessly blended\r\ndialect of an East-Side saloon-keeper and a Middle-West farmer,\r\nwhile the indolent but dogged John Bull was made the emblem of\r\nstupid honesty, good sportsmanship and love of fair play; he was\r\nrepresented as being charged, rather against his inclination, with\r\nan imperial mission and as being endowed with a special skill in\r\nadministering an empire; he was credited with a marrow-deep love\r\nof liberty and a genius for self-government. Even the war has done\r\nlittle to disturb these complacent hallucinations.\r\n\r\n[6] While this book was writing, I learned to my own regret and to\r\nthe abiding loss of the House, that Dr. Strong, an Old Westminster,\r\nhad been appointed to the bishopric of Ripon.\r\n\r\n[7] From time to time the regular speakers went on strike. It was\r\nthen usual for one to propose the motion \"That something be now\r\ndone\" and to secure that it was not carried, thus holding up all\r\npublic business indefinitely. At Univ., I believe, it was customary\r\nto open the proceedings of the \"Shakespeare\" with a resolution\r\n\"That the Bard be not read.\"\r\n\r\n[8] In these years Ronald Knox, Patrick Shaw-Stewart and Charles\r\nLister occupied a place once filled by Raymond Asquith and, before\r\nhim, shared by John Simon, F. E. Smith, Hilaire Belloc and E. G.\r\nHemmerde.\r\n\r\n[9] I am informed by my friend, Captain Stephen Holmes, M.C., to\r\nwhom I am indebted for many valuable suggestions, that the use\r\nof the guest-table had to be suspended owing to the rush of new\r\nmembers to the House in 1919.\r\n\r\n[10] One man became so much obsessed by the universality of a\r\nschool in which all knowledge had a place, if he could but find it,\r\nthat he was discovered on the morning of his examination committing\r\nto memory the statement of the _Morning Post_ that Lady X had left\r\nHill Street for Scotland; somehow, he felt, this had a bearing on\r\nmodern history; and I have no doubt that he used the information to\r\nillustrate a point of manorial tenure or to differentiate between\r\nthe life of the new nobility and that described by Tacitus in the\r\n_Germania_.\r\n\r\n[11] I write of 1906-9, before women were admitted to degrees or\r\naccorded an academic position or costume.\r\n\r\n[12] Once a year the Gilbert and Sullivan operas came to Oxford;\r\nthe booking opened a week in advance, and a queue stretched the\r\nlength of George Street and half-way down the Corn. For days\r\nbefore and afterwards every piano in the college was tinkling\r\nwith \"The Silver Church\" or the \"Peers' Chorus.\" And we, in 1909,\r\nwere privileged to entertain at luncheon Fred Billington, a great\r\ncomedian and the greatest of all Pooh Bahs; fifteen or twenty\r\nof us, of the true Gilbert and Sullivan faith, shyly fed him\r\nwith roast turkey and plum pudding, and he too was a little shy,\r\nsuspecting some practical joke.\r\n\r\nThe visitor is sometimes surprised that the New Theatre contains\r\nno boxes; the reason was supplied, in my day, by a famous living\r\nactor, who explained that he and his friends had attended a\r\nmelodrama in the old theatre and had taken an uncontrollable\r\ndislike for the villain's trousers. As Æschylus undertook to finish\r\nany prologue of Euripides with the words \"_ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν_,\" so\r\nthis undergraduate party qualified the villain's every boast and\r\nconfession with the words: \"_Not_ in those trousers.\"\r\n\r\nThe dialogue ran roughly thus:\r\n\r\n  _Villain._ I will carry the girl off and make her my wife----\r\n\r\n  _Interrupters._                  _Not_ in those trousers.\r\n\r\n  _Villain._ I will be revenged----\r\n\r\n  _Interrupters._                  _Not_ in those trousers.\r\n\r\n  _Villain._ I will stick at nothing----\r\n\r\n  _Interrupters._                  _Not_ in those trousers.\r\n\r\nAs the curtain fell on the first act, the interrupters leapt from\r\ntheir box on the stage and pursued the villain down the Corn and\r\nthe High until they captured him on Magdalen Bridge. They then\r\nreturned to the theatre with the offending trousers but without the\r\nvillain.\r\n\r\nJowett, as vice-chancellor, decreed that in the new theatre no\r\nboxes should be built.\r\n\r\n[13] The late Sir Edward Cook once did me the honour to quote the\r\nwords of one of my own characters: \"I am tempted to wonder whether\r\nit much matters what a man be taught, so long as he meet enough men\r\nwho have been taught something else.\" Therein lies the difference\r\nbetween university education and all other kinds.\r\n\r\n[14] It is hardly possible to think of Oxford in those years\r\nwithout thinking of the second volume of _Sinister Street_ and\r\nof the great picture in which Compton Mackenzie's observation,\r\nmemory and delicate realization of atmosphere were so triumphantly\r\nblended. At the House we had, no doubt, a stereotyped conception\r\nof the \"typical\" New College man; Balliol, no doubt, had its\r\nconventional idea of the average St. John's man; it was left to\r\nCompton Mackenzie to shew, from the angle of Magdalen, the reaction\r\nof the Exeter \"type\" on the imagination of Univ. The book is\r\nconfined within the limits which Oxford of necessity imposes on\r\nherself as the theme or background of a novel; Oxford is a phase\r\nthrough which youth passes, a kingdom wherein it tarries, a hive\r\nwhere it grows and works towards maturity; it is not generally a\r\nscene of romance, of spiritual crisis or emotional clash; and,\r\nbecause most novels on Oxford persist in forcing drama into the\r\nleast dramatic lives, they stand condemned as psychological\r\nconfusions. It is a kingdom of youth because youth is made\r\ncomfortably secure from the material conflicts of conventional\r\ndrama; and youth, however intensely interested in itself, does not\r\nregard its spiritual conflicts seriously, it no longer agonizes\r\nin doubt nor wrestles in prayer, and, if it fall in love, ecstacy\r\nwill disturb its digestion as little as despair will derange its\r\nslumbers. And the novelist of Oxford who writes with perspective\r\nand a sense of the appropriate must treat his material as youth\r\nawakening but not yet awake and as youth snugly protected from\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nFor this reason and under these limitations, all women, all men who\r\ndo not know Oxford and even the men who do will, in that order, be\r\nprudently advised to leave Oxford alone; after _Sinister Street_,\r\nwith its analysis and atmosphere, its restraint and its consummate\r\nhandling of countless figures on a giant canvas, there is no room\r\nfor a book conceived on similar lines or scale; the novelist must\r\nforce upon Oxford something which Oxford disowns or he may turn\r\ndisgustedly away from a place where innumerable people talk and\r\nthink endlessly about something that does not matter to any one\r\nelse and where nothing ever happens.\r\n\r\n[15] The House went head of the river in 1907 and remained there\r\nfor the rest of my time, an achievement to be periodically\r\ncelebrated with a triumphant bump-supper, fire-works and a bonfire\r\nwhich once afforded to some an opportunity of venting their\r\ndispleasure on the Oxford Pageant stands.\r\n\r\n[16] Mark Twain was the recipient of an honorary degree in these\r\nyears, and the welcome accorded him was characteristic. By an\r\nunhappy coincidence certain news-bills had appeared with the words:\r\n\"ARRIVAL OF MARK TWAIN IN ENGLAND. THEFT OF ASCOT GOLD CUP.\" Before\r\nhe was allowed to take his degree, an untiring undergraduate\r\nchorus demanded to know: \"Now, Mark, what did you do with the Gold\r\nCup?\" His reply I never heard; it was probably adequate, though\r\noccasionally he met his match in repartee. Once when he was staying\r\nin England as a young man, the income-tax authorities sent him\r\nan assessment form which he referred to Queen Victoria with the\r\nstatement that he had not the honour to be one of her subjects; she\r\nmust forgive his writing to her, because, though he did not know\r\nher, he had once had the pleasure of meeting her son. \"He,\" said\r\nMark Twain, \"was driving in his coach of state to St. Paul's, and\r\nI was on the top of a 'bus.\" Many years later, when he returned to\r\nEngland in his glory, he was presented to King Edward who said that\r\nhe was glad to meet him again. \"Again, sir?\" echoed Mark Twain.\r\n\"Have you forgotten our first meeting?\" asked the king. \"I was in\r\nmy coach of state, driving to St. Paul's, and you were on the top\r\nof a 'bus.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Lord Wolmer, the late W. G. C. Gladstone and the late Francis\r\nMcLaren are the only exceptions that I recall in my own time.\r\n\r\n[18] The phrase is borrowed from my friend, Walter Roch.\r\n\r\n[19] The parliament which ultimately conceded the vote was\r\nsubstantially the same that had refused it in 1913; its \"mandate\"\r\nwas still primarily for the parliament bill and the bills covered\r\nby that; but the war changed, with other things, the responsibility\r\nof a member to his constituents and the new franchise was granted\r\nby men with no more authority to grant it than to abolish the\r\nmonarchy or to make marriage compulsory.\r\n\r\n[20] The name applied to themselves by members of a party which\r\nis Scottish in origin and which has, in the course of history,\r\nrepudiated its allegiance to the Catholic Church and the Stuart\r\ndynasty and threatened to repudiate its allegiance to the\r\nHanoverian dynasty.\r\n\r\n[21] These quotations are taken from Mr. Hugh Martin's _Ireland in\r\nInsurrection_.\r\n\r\n[22] This and the following quotations are taken from _The Complete\r\nGrammar of Anarchy_ compiled by Mr. J. J. Horgan.\r\n\r\n[23] But not Viscount Grey.\r\n\r\n[24] Anatole France, in _Les Dieux ont soif_, which was written\r\nseveral years before the war of 1914, gives a few specimens of the\r\nportents and rumours which agitated Paris when the armies of the\r\nallies were marching against the revolutionary government. They\r\nwere, almost without exception, reproduced in England in the first\r\nmonth of the war.\r\n\r\n[25] _W. G. C. Gladstone: A Memoir._ By Viscount Gladstone.\r\n\r\n[26] I am told that a similar herd-hallucination overtook Paris in\r\nthe war of 1870. A rumour that the Crown Prince's army had been\r\nsurrounded and that the news was posted at the Hôtel de Ville\r\nbrought the inhabitants by thousands into the streets till those\r\nwho were pressed against the Hôtel de Ville and those who were\r\nfarthest away alike maintained that they had read the official\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n[27] Generosity and war seem incompatible!\r\n\r\n  _Wellington._ It's Marshal Ney himself who heads the charge.\r\n                  The finest cavalry commander, he,\r\n                  That wears a foreign plume; ay, probably\r\n                  The whole world through!\r\n\r\n  _Spirit Ironic._ And when that matchless chief\r\n                   Sentenced shall lie to ignominious death\r\n                   But technically deserved, no finger he\r\n                   Who speaks will lift to save him!\r\n\r\n  _Spirit of the Pities._  To his shame.\r\n                           We must discount war's generous impulses\r\n                           I sadly see.\r\n\r\n                                       THOMAS HARDY: _The Dynasts_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] I remained at Westminster a year, judging that period to be as\r\nlong as I could support the daily risk of detection by pupils or\r\ncolleagues. Sometimes--now that it is all over--I blush to think\r\nof the subjects that I essayed to teach; and sometimes I blush to\r\nrecall the lessons that I actually taught. Since leaving, I have\r\nseen my year's work passed in more candid review than was possible\r\nat the time and have been honoured with a place in the repertory of\r\nimitations in which Westminsters love to indulge whenever two or\r\nthree are gathered together. If one or two of my least promising\r\npupils pay me the compliment of saying that I taught them at least\r\nsomething, one or two of the most promising now ask me how it was\r\nthat I never discovered them cribbing in form or thrusting strange\r\ngifts down the necks of their neighbours. Our warfare was waged\r\nwith good humour for the most part, though only a schoolmaster\r\nknows how highly his sense of justice may be tested in dealing\r\nwith some one who is personally antagonistic to him. With many\r\nI am proud to say that I made lasting friendships: during the\r\nlater years of the war I received letters from every front and\r\nmy old pupils came to see me when they were on leave; since the\r\nwar they write from Africa and America, I meet them in London and\r\nOxford, we abandon ourselves to school \"shop\", and they embarrass\r\nme by occasionally addressing me as \"sir\". To my friends of the\r\nModern Transitus from Play Term, 1914, to Election Term, 1915,\r\nto the Classical Transitus, the Modern Sixth, the Mathematical\r\nSixth, the History Sixth and the Seventh, wherever you may be, I\r\nsend greeting; my injustice was unintentional, my incompetence\r\nincurable; I should be well pleased to think that your memories\r\nof me are a hundredth part as kindly as my memories of you. For\r\nperhaps the first three cautious days you were a little awed by me:\r\nthe cap and gown were imposing. I was taller than any of you, as an\r\nOld Westminster I knew too much about detention school and penal\r\ndrill; above all, I also had lived in Arcady and had sat at those\r\nvery desks not ten years before; does it comfort you to know that\r\nmy awe of you continued for three terms? If ever the prayer-bell\r\nhad not rung before I shewed that I could not solve some diabolical\r\nequation! If you had argued a little more confidently against my\r\nmagisterial rulings! If you could have seen into my mind during the\r\nfirst week, when I took down your names, ranged you in alphabetical\r\norder and guided myself despairingly by the two red-heads in the\r\nform!\r\n\r\n[29] I believe that the Education Office section, appropriately\r\nenough, threw into Latin elegiacs the general confession beginning:\r\n\"My beat extends from (the sentry-box) to (the gate on Constitution\r\nHill) and must be patrolled regularly ...\"; I never saw a copy.\r\n\r\n[30] When Lord Emmott, the Director of the War Trade Department,\r\ninvited me to serve under him in the summer of 1915, I intended to\r\ncome only for the school holidays; as, however, the work of the\r\nblockade increased steadily, I asked Dr. Gow to release me for as\r\nlong as I might be wanted.\r\n\r\n[31] As it had been in existence for five months before I entered\r\nit, I can only describe its early history from hearsay.\r\n\r\n[32] Six years before, on the first night of _The Blue Bird_, I\r\nremember constructing from the name of Alexander Teixeira de Mattos\r\na mental picture of some one very tall, very thin, very dark and\r\nsaturnine, with a long amber cigarette-holder and a single eyeglass\r\ndepending from a broad black ribbon. I had not then seen Max\r\nBeerbohm's caricature of him; and, at our first meeting, I murmured\r\nto myself, as hundreds have done before and since: \"Of course! The\r\nold sheep in _Alice Through the Looking-Glass_.\" As hundreds have\r\ndone before and since, I surrendered to his charm; and there is no\r\nfriend to whom I owe more. For over three years we worked together,\r\nmany hours a day for six days a week; our minds and moods found\r\nsomething always in common; in five years there cannot have been\r\nmany days on which we did not meet or telephone or write. In the\r\nnext five years may there be as few!\r\n\r\nI am not alone in fashioning an imaginary figure to bear such\r\na name. I am told that a distinguished black-and-white artist,\r\nmeeting the name fortuitously, would walk pensively through the\r\nstreets of London thereafter, searching the faces of the passers-by\r\nfor one that would fit his ideal, Alexander-Teixeira-de-Mattos\r\nconception. And, when they met, I wonder if the artist was as\r\nmuch frightened as every newcomer to the department. On my second\r\nmorning I looked up suddenly into a white impassive face; eyes\r\nunchanging in expression regarded me through the tortoise-shell\r\nspectacles which bestrid the impressive nose; the mouth was\r\ntightly-shut; neither word nor movement explained this paralysing\r\nfigure which had glided to my table like some wandering sphinx. \"I\r\nam not sure whether your minute intends to convey ...\" he began\r\nat length and to my indescribable relief. Fear departed with that\r\nword, and we collaborated in redrawing the minute. Sometimes the\r\nTeixeira panic spread to distant committees which only knew his\r\nexquisite handwriting and his disabling knowledge of English; they\r\nhastened to do his bidding and to avert his wrath; no chairman\r\nlikes to apologize twice for \"the curiously pococurantist attitude\r\nof your committee\", few care even to have the apology accepted with\r\nthe words that consigned so many controversial files to oblivion:\r\n\"Pray say no more. A.T.\"\r\n\r\n[33] Sir Ian Hamilton's _Gallipoli Diary_ is one of many military\r\ndocuments that shew that civilian morale at home cracked before\r\nthe morale of the soldiers under fire. There was a fantastic\r\nlegend that the English were unvaryingly calm and resolute, with\r\na calmness and resolution that became calmer and more resolute\r\nwith every demand. Nothing is farther from the truth. There\r\nwas a panic when the Amiens despatch was published; and every\r\noutburst of popular violence or madness had panic as its origin\r\nand explanation. The spy-mania, the attack on Lord Haldane, the\r\nconscription campaign, the hunt for aliens and, finally, the\r\nPemberton-Billing case were each in turn the result of a panic\r\ncaused by accumulated despondency or by the violent despair induced\r\nby a sudden reverse. The east-end Jews who cowered in tube stations\r\nduring air-raids had their own means of shewing fear; but it was\r\nnot the only means.\r\n\r\n[34] This is becoming a conventional aftermath of any war in\r\nwhich the vanquished is so heavily defeated that he has to make a\r\nsuperhuman effort to galvanize his country into new life. The same\r\nalarms were spread by the Germans about the French in 1875.\r\n\r\n[35] \"It is said,\" writes Mr. Walter Roch in _Mr. Lloyd George and\r\nthe War_, \"that as a result of this Conference ('the Constitutional\r\nConference which sat in secret between the two General Elections in\r\n1910, and tried to reach a settlement of the constitutional issue,\r\nby agreement'), in the course of which a wide range of topics must\r\nhave been discussed, Mr. Lloyd George then proposed, and committed\r\nto writing, a scheme for a Coalition Government which would settle\r\nthe question of the House of Lords and Home Rule, adopt some form\r\nof National Service, and finance the Navy by means of a loan. But\r\nthe details of this scheme are only vaguely known and add to our\r\nconfusion.\"\r\n\r\nI am not aware, however, that the allegation has ever been denied.\r\n\r\n[36] I have ventured to enumerate, twice within a few pages,\r\nthe chief causes of despondency at the end of 1916: the same\r\nthought-wave, given off from the same psychological effervescence,\r\nconvinced President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George that the allies\r\nwere beaten to their knees; the one was inspired to throw the\r\nresources of America into the struggle, the other to take personal\r\ncharge of the war.\r\n\r\n[37] 1920.\r\n\r\n[38] Sir Ian Malcolm was inspired by this memorandum to write\r\nhis \"rhymed endeavour to convey the contents of a grave\r\n'pronunciamento' on deportment: compiled (it is believed) by Lord\r\nEustace Percy and issued to the Members of the Mission before\r\nlanding in the New World.\" The poem appears among the \"Mission\r\nHymns\" in _Stuff--And Nonsense_. \"CIRCULAR NOTES\"\r\n\r\n_To the Mission_\r\n\r\n      In your hours of ease, I beg you\r\n        Missionaries, one and all,\r\n      Read, mark, learn, digest and pass on\r\n        This concise Encyclical.\r\n      You will find its interest chaining\r\n        --Sometimes even entertaining.\r\n\r\n      First of all you must remember\r\n        That you go to U.S.A.,\r\n      To a land of candid critics;\r\n        So be careful what you say.\r\n      I shan't mind the least if some\r\n      People think you're deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\n      If with questions you are pestered\r\n        By the Press for news athirst,\r\n      Do not risk replying till you've\r\n        Wired home for instructions first.\r\n      Heaven knows what might occur\r\n      If you answered \"on the spur.\"\r\n\r\n      _E.G._: \"Why bring re-made soldiers\r\n        On your diplomatic stunt?\"\r\n      Should the ready lie elude you\r\n        Give a non-committal grunt,\r\n      Or remark with pungent wit\r\n      \"_Miles nascitur non fit_.\"\r\n\r\n      (_Note: for General T.

Olympic._                              A. J. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n[39] This was, of course, before the great explosion.\r\n\r\n[40] It was, I believe, originally intended that no speeches should\r\nbe delivered; but, when M. Viviani felt that he ought to say a few\r\nwords on behalf of the French, Mr. Balfour could not do less than\r\nspeak on behalf of his own mission. There was no time to prepare a\r\nformal oration, but the exquisite phrasing of his inscription was\r\nat least not less impressive than any speech. The original sheet of\r\npaper on which it was written has been, I understand, chemically\r\ntreated against fading or decay and preserved among the historical\r\nrecords of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"M. Viviani,\" said Mr. Balfour, \"has expressed in most eloquent\r\nwords the feelings which grip us all here to-day. He has not only\r\npaid a fitting tribute to a great statesman, but he has brought\r\nour thoughts most vividly down to the present. The thousands who\r\nhave given their lives, French, Russian, Italian, Belgian, Servian,\r\nMontenegrin, Roumanian, Japanese and British, were fighting for\r\nwhat they believed to be the cause of liberty.\r\n\r\n\"There is no place in the world where a speech for the cause of\r\nliberty would be better placed than here at the tomb of Washington.\r\nBut as that work has been so adequately done by a master of\r\noratory, perhaps you will permit me to read a few words prepared by\r\nthe British mission for the wreath we are to leave here to-day:\r\n\r\n\"'Dedicated by the British mission to the immortal memory of George\r\nWashington, soldier, statesman, patriot, who would have rejoiced to\r\nsee the country of which he was by birth a citizen and the country\r\nwhich his genius called into existence fighting side by side to\r\nsave mankind from subjection to a military despotism.'\"\r\n\r\n[41] It is sad to record that the unwonted strain and exertion were\r\ntoo much for the advanced age of Mr. Choate, who died the following\r\nday; yet I doubt whether he could have chosen a happier moment for\r\ndeath than that which saw the great ambition of his life realised\r\nin the cordial friendship and whole-hearted cooperation of the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[42] Sir William Peterson, then Principal of M'Gill University.\r\nWhile writing this book, I received by wireless, on my way to South\r\nAmerica, the sad news of his death.\r\n\r\n[43] In fact, General Pershing crossed independently.\r\n\r\n[44] Judge Amos, now Judicial Adviser in Cairo, endorses\r\nthe substantial truth of the report which circulated about\r\nhis chess-playing at this time. A tall man with a folding\r\npocket-chessboard and a coloured silk handkerchief containing an\r\nincomplete set of chessmen might have been observed at almost any\r\nhour of the day or night prowling the deck with a preoccupied air\r\nand seeking to lure any one into playing with him. Those who knew\r\nthe moves promptly beat him; those who did not know the moves had\r\nthem lucidly explained--and then beat him as promptly. He had, I\r\nbelieve, exhausted the 6,000 Canadian troops, the ship's company\r\nand the other members of the mission before approaching that corner\r\nof the smoking-room in which, according to the story, I was sitting\r\nwith an expression of imbecility calculated to suggest that I\r\ncould not play chess and would not learn. He persevered with his\r\nexplanation and after five minutes challenged me to a game. I hate\r\nto record that he did not win it.\r\n\r\n[45] The phrase is borrowed from Mr. Asquith.\r\n\r\n[46] One of the last words, in a long list beginning with\r\n\"Armageddon,\" to hypnotize the newspaper-reader.\r\n\r\n[47] One evening I entered Covent Garden after the curtain had\r\nrisen. \"M. Kerenski?\" enquired the sole occupant of the box,\r\npeering at me through the gloom. \"I beg your pardon! I see that he\r\nlanded in England this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n[48] At the risk of a prophecy I would suggest that Masefield's\r\n_Gallipoli_ has a lasting place in the treasury of great English\r\nprose, so long, at least, as our present canons of perfection in\r\nprose-style are maintained.\r\n\r\n[49] I am not limiting myself strictly to those war-books which had\r\nbeen published by the date of the armistice.\r\n\r\n[50] \"Honestly, I do not care about the clever people,\" confessed\r\n'Lady Maybury'. \"I find them _borné_, self-centred, touchy, and\r\nembarrassing. They have _no_ conversation, and they always ask me\r\nif I was at Ranelagh last Saturday. Have you ever observed that?\"\r\n\r\n[51] At Oxford I first heard the couplet which tells how\r\n\r\n  \"From out their different tubs\r\n  Stubbs butters Freeman,\r\n  Freeman butters Stubbs,\"\r\n\r\nit was quoted by one member of a prolific triumvirate which then\r\nfilled a considerable proportion of the critical journals. In those\r\ndays it was hardly possible to read an article by A which did not\r\ncontain a panegyric of B's latest book; it was no less difficult to\r\nread B's book without meeting a reference to what had been \"most\r\njustly observed by C.\"\r\n\r\n[52] The volume of hostile reviews, surely too great to be\r\nspontaneous and independent, which greeted _The Autobiography of\r\nMargot Asquith_, was only less remarkable than the success which\r\nthe book achieved in spite of them.\r\n\r\n[53] It will not have been forgotten that, in 1920, a cinematograph\r\nactress received a welcome to London which may have been equalled\r\nby crowned heads, but has, I should think, never been surpassed.\r\nWherever she went, the streets were thronged; in its desire to see\r\nher, the crowd at a theatrical garden party nearly crushed her to\r\ndeath. Would Madame Curie, I wonder, have secured a single cheer?\r\nWould Miss Nightingale have been recognised?\r\n\r\n[54] The temptation to make class-lists is almost irresistible: I\r\nhave been taken to task for saying in an introduction to Couperus'\r\n_Old People and the Things That Pass_ that it was one of the\r\nworld's half-dozen greatest novels; but the temptation should be\r\nresisted, for the proof of our fallibility is ever before our eyes.\r\n\r\n[55] On the first night of _L'Heure espagnole_ a devil entered into\r\none member of the audience and tempted him to murmur at any open\r\ndoor: \"Is this not extraordinarily reminiscent of Aïda?\" Complete\r\nand immediate agreement was his reward.\r\n\r\n[56] _Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret._ It is natural\r\nfor Balliol to gravitate to the cabinet; and distinction was lent\r\nto the business government by the presence of Lord Curzon.\r\n\r\n[57]                      _Memorandum_\r\n\r\nTO THE CABINET BY LORD MILNER ON HIS VISIT TO FRANCE, INCLUDING THE\r\n             CONFERENCE AT DOULLENS, MARCH 26TH, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister having asked me to run over to France in order\r\nto report to the Cabinet personally on the position of affairs\r\nthere, I left Charing Cross at 12.50 on Sunday, March 24th....\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Doullens I was at once seized by Clemenceau, who\r\nstartled me by the announcement that Haig had just declared that\r\nhe would be obliged to uncover Amiens and fall back on the Channel\r\nports. I told him I felt sure there must be some misunderstanding\r\nabout this, and that before the general Conference I thought it\r\nwas desirable that I should have a short conversation with the\r\nField-Marshal and the Army Commanders, whom I had not yet seen....\r\n\r\nThe views of the British Commanders having thus been cleared\r\nup, the Conference assembled.... I asked whether I might have\r\na word with Clemenceau alone. I then told him quite frankly of\r\nthe conviction which had been growing in my mind ever since the\r\nprevious day, and had been confirmed by my conversations with\r\nWilson and Haig, that Foch appeared to me to be the man who had\r\nthe greatest grasp of the situation, and was most likely to deal\r\nwith it with the intensest energy. Could not he be placed by both\r\nthe Governments in a position of general control, and given the\r\nsort of authority which he (Foch) had himself suggested to Wilson?\r\nClemenceau, whose own mind, I am sure, had been steadily moving in\r\nthe same direction, at once agreed, but he asked for a few minutes\r\nto speak to Pétain. While he took Pétain aside, I did the same\r\nwith Haig. While I explained to the latter what was contemplated,\r\nhe seemed not only quite willing, but really pleased. Meanwhile,\r\nClemenceau had spoken to Pétain, and immediately wrote and handed\r\nme the following form of words, to embody what he and I had just\r\nagreed to:\r\n\r\n_Le général Foch est chargé par les gouvernements britanniques\r\net français de coordonner l'action des armées britanniques et\r\nfrançaises sur le front ouest. Il s'entendra à cet effet avec les\r\ndeux généraux en chef, qui sont invités à lui fournir tous les\r\nrenseignements nécessaires._\r\n\r\nI showed this to Haig, who readily accepted it, but suggested that\r\nit should be extended to cover the other armies--Belgian, American\r\nand possibly Italian--that might be employed on the present\r\nFranco-British front. To this Clemenceau at once agreed. We then\r\nall went back to the table. The amended formula, which ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Le général Foch est chargé par les gouvernements britanniques et\r\nfrançais de coordonner l'action des armées alliées sur le front\r\nouest. Il s'entendra à cet effet avec les généraux en chef, qui\r\nsont invités à lui fournir tous les renseignements nécessaires._\r\n\r\n  DOULLENS,\r\n  _le 26 mars, 1918_.\r\n\r\nwas read out, and after a very short discussion, which amounted\r\nto nothing more than cordial approval of the principle by all the\r\nspeakers, the document was signed by Clemenceau and myself, and\r\nthe Conference immediately rose with every appearance of general\r\nsatisfaction....\r\n\r\nThis quotation is taken from the special supplement to _The New\r\nStatesman_ of 23 April, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE\r\n\r\n-Plain print and punctuation errors fixed.",
