Tzaricide is unfortunately as popular in Russia as it ever\r\nwas, and the so-called Nihilists have, since the accession of Nicholas\r\nII., relinquished none of their activity. There was but little genuine\r\nmourning for Alexander III., and the feigned national affliction was\r\nspeedily succeeded by joyful anticipations of a new and prosperous\r\nera. But Russia has already found that her golden hopes have faded.\r\nThe powerful, unscrupulous officials surrounding the young sovereign,\r\nprompted by those evil principles that made Russia under Alexander III.\r\na blot upon European civilisation, have, by painting in lurid colours\r\na rude and ungrateful nation whom to govern is now his thankless task,\r\nquickly succeeded in crushing any projected reforms. Thus the despairing\r\nnation continues to writhe under the oppression of corrupt officials,\r\nand those who dare lift their voices in protest are arrested and hurried\r\nwithout trial to far Siberia. The land is inundated with the swelling\r\nflood of the people’s sorrow as rivers in spring, abundant with water,\r\noverflow the fields, and it will always be as long as an irresponsible,\r\ncruel, and despotic autocracy holds and directs her destinies.\r\n\r\nThe Tzar knows little of the horrors committed in his name. He has never\r\nbeen inside the tenth pavilion in Warsaw Citadel, where starving people\r\nhave, times without number, been knouted to death. He knows nothing of\r\nthe dark underground dungeons overrun with vermin in the Peter-Paul\r\nFortress; he has never breathed their fœtid, poisoned atmosphere. Even\r\nwhen he crossed Siberia the officials who surrounded him took every\r\nprecaution to prevent him from witnessing the troops of wretched,\r\nshivering humanity trudging through trackless snows and driven to their\r\ngloomy tombs with knouts and butt-ends. Revolutionists are the creation\r\nof circumstances, of the general discontent of the people, of the\r\nstriving of Russia after a new social framework. Discontent only grows\r\nthe more when it is repressed. For this reason the places of slain and\r\nimprisoned Revolutionists are constantly taken by individuals who come\r\nforth from among the people in ever-increasing numbers, and who are still\r\nmore embittered, still more energetic. Truly the Imperial Autocracy is\r\ntottering towards its doom.\r\n\r\nBy a special order issued from the Press Bureau at St. Petersburg copies\r\nof this book are prohibited from entering the Russian Empire, while, not\r\ncontent with the formal interdiction of my novel, “Guilty Bonds,” which\r\ndeals with a political conspiracy, the Russian Government has also sent\r\none of its emissaries to my house in London to inform me of the fact.\r\nThis, I believe, is a personal attention received by no other English\r\nauthor. The methods of the agents of the Russian Secret Police in London\r\nand the measures taken by the Revolutionists to repress their activity\r\nwill probably be a revelation to English readers, some of whom will\r\ndoubtless recognise a few of the following chapters as having appeared\r\nin my “Strange Tales of a Nihilist,” now out of print. That I have been\r\ncompelled to bestow fictitious names upon the actors in these dramas, add\r\nand suppress certain incidents, and change the scene in more than one\r\ninstance, is obvious; nevertheless, I anticipate that many will recognise\r\nin Anton Prèhznev’s stories solutions of more than one sensational\r\nmystery that has startled Europe.\r\n\r\n                                                        WILLIAM LE QUEUX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAP.

Unfortunately, English writers, unacquainted with Russian\r\nlife, ignorant of the true objects of the organisation, or of its inner\r\nworking, and only recognising its far-reaching influence, have surrounded\r\nNihilism with a glamour and mystery that would be highly amusing to us\r\nwere it not for the fact that their sensational and sanguinary narratives\r\ninjure our cause. So little does the average Englishman know of the\r\nconditions of life under the Tzar, that any argument in favour of\r\nNihilism would be useless and wearisome, therefore I leave him to decide\r\nfor himself, after reading the exciting episodes of a strange career,\r\nwhether Autocracy or Freedom is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nI, Anton Prèhznev, subject of the Tzar, now in exile in England, hereby\r\nmake free and full confession of my secret alliance with the so-called\r\nand mis-called Nihilist Party. We, who are struggling to effect a change\r\nfor the better in the internal and economical condition of the Russian\r\npeople, look with envy upon every Englishman, at the same time regarding\r\nhim as a brother. To overthrow the dynasty by murder is not our object,\r\nalthough, alas! human life has been sacrificed, as my narrative will\r\nshow. We desire peace; and while staying our hand and refraining from\r\ndealing the blows that are at this moment in our power to strike at the\r\nImperial Autocracy, we are living in the expectation that the flood of\r\npopular indignation will sweep off the face of the Russian soil the\r\nbureaucracy, the _tchinovniks_, and the present ruinous and shameful\r\nsystem of organised robbery and tyranny, and create something better than\r\nthe existing brutality and corruption that has plunged so many millions\r\nin abject misery.\r\n\r\nPrior to narrating the exciting incidents of my career, it will be\r\nnecessary, in order that it should be rightly understood why I lifted a\r\nhand against the rule of the Tzar, Alexander III., or his successor the\r\nTzar Nicholas, to describe the tragic events which led to the overflow of\r\nmy indignation against tyranny, and caused my subsequent alliance with\r\nthe Brothers of Freedom.\r\n\r\nFew English readers rightly understand the claims of the Russian\r\nRevolutionists, therefore it will be well to make an explanation, and I\r\ncannot do better than quote from the secretly printed manifesto issued\r\nby the Narodnoe Pravo (“Popular Right”) Party. This manifesto, which was\r\nrecently circulated widely by clandestine means throughout the Russian\r\nEmpire, and even in Siberia, points out in forcible language that Russia\r\nmust now determine her further destinies, and consider the question of\r\npolitical freedom. It proceeds as follows:—\r\n\r\n“As there is not, and cannot be, a hope that the Government will\r\nwillingly enter upon the path indicated, there is but one course\r\nremaining to the people, to oppose by the force of organised public\r\nopinion the inertness of the Government and the narrow dynastic interests\r\nof the autocracy. The Narodnoe Pravo has in view the creation of this\r\nforce. In the opinion of the Party popular right includes in itself alike\r\nthe conception of the right of the people to political freedom, and the\r\nconception of its right to secure its material needs upon the basis of\r\nnational production. The Party considers the guarantees of this right to\r\nbe:—Representative government on the basis of universal suffrage; freedom\r\nof religious belief; independence of the Courts of Justice; freedom\r\nof the Press; freedom of meeting and association; inviolability of the\r\nindividual, and of his rights as a man.\r\n\r\n“Thus understanding popular right, the Party sets itself the task of\r\nuniting all the oppositional elements of the country, and of organising\r\nan active force which should, with all the spiritual and material means\r\nat its disposal, attain the overthrow of autocracy, and secure to every\r\none the rights of a citizen and a man.”\r\n\r\nI commenced life under a disadvantage, for I am a Jew.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the law declares all Hebrews to be “aliens whose several rights\r\nare regulated by special ordinances,” and my race is regarded as a pariah\r\ncaste in consequence. The memory of my earlier years it is unnecessary\r\nto recall. My father, Isaac Prèhznev, was a well-known operator on the\r\nBourse in Petersburg, and he and my mother moved in good society. Our\r\nhouse in the Isàkievskaya was well known to people with long-sounding\r\ntitles and long pedigrees, and, as children, my sister Mascha and I had\r\nmade a practice of standing upon the stairs on Thursday nights, watching\r\nthe arrival of the uniformed and much-decorated men and handsome ladies\r\nwho attended the receptions which my parents gave weekly during the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nMascha, three years my junior, was petted by the guests and servants none\r\nthe less than I had been, for we were a pair of over-indulged children,\r\nand lived a life of uninterrupted happiness.\r\n\r\nAt last I arrived at an age when departure from home became compulsory,\r\nand one eventful day I bade farewell to those I loved and was drafted to\r\nVologda to perform my military service. From a life of luxurious ease to\r\na soldier’s existence in the barren district around Lake Kubinskoi was\r\nby no means a pleasurable change, especially as, according to law, no\r\nJew can rise to the rank of officer, although he is bound to serve in\r\nthe rank and file like all other Russians. Nevertheless, I endured the\r\nwearying monotony of eternal drill, receiving occasional letters that\r\ncame from my distant home like brief rays of sunshine upon my otherwise\r\ndark, unhappy life. Suddenly, when I had been at Vologda about two\r\nyears, they ceased. Several times I wrote, but received no answer. I\r\ntelegraphed, but with the same result. I wrote to relatives in Petersburg\r\ninquiring the cause of my parents’ strange silence, yet even these\r\nletters remained unanswered.\r\n\r\nUnable to obtain leave of absence, the days passed slowly, and I grew\r\nsorely puzzled at the mystery.\r\n\r\nImagine my feelings when one morning a comrade, who had had a _Novoë\r\nVremya_ sent to him, handed me the newspaper and pointing to a line,\r\nasked—\r\n\r\n“Is he any relation of yours?”\r\n\r\nI looked eagerly where he indicated. My heart stood still, and the paper\r\nfell from my nerveless grasp.\r\n\r\nIt was an announcement to the effect that “Isaac Prèhznev, Jew, of the\r\nIsàkievskaya, St. Petersburg,” had formed one of the convoy of prisoners\r\nexiled by administrative process to Siberia during the past week!\r\n\r\nIgnorant of the whereabouts of my mother and sister, and apprehensive\r\nregarding their future, I was refused leave and forced to continue my\r\nmilitary service until the day arrived when I was free to return and seek\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the continuity of this narrative, events must here be\r\ndescribed which were afterwards related to me by Mascha.\r\n\r\nFrom some unknown cause my unfortunate father had fallen into disfavour\r\nwith the Tzar, although nothing was known of it until one night, during\r\nthe progress of a ball at home, half-a-dozen men from the _Okhrannoë\r\nOtdelenïe_,[1] entered and arrested him. A fortnight later he was sent,\r\nwithout trial, to the mines of the Trans-Baikal, all he possessed was\r\nconfiscated by the Government, and my mother and sister turned into the\r\nstreets to starve.\r\n\r\nOur relations were poor and could do little to assist them; therefore, in\r\norder to hide their poverty, Mascha and her mother went to Mstislavl, a\r\nsmall sleepy town in the Government of Moghilev, where for nearly a year\r\nthey earned a precarious livelihood by doing needlework and making lace.\r\nBut the year was disastrous to Russia, for a terrible famine spread over\r\nthe land, and, alas! for my unfortunate family, its effects were keenly\r\nfelt in Moghilev. At the time I arrived at Petersburg in search of them,\r\nthey had no work and were starving.\r\n\r\nStretched upon a straw mattress in the corner of a cold, bare room in a\r\nwretched _isba_, lay my mother, her thin, haggard face, protruding cheek\r\nbones, and sunken eyes showing unmistakably that death was at hand.\r\n\r\nMascha stood, pale and motionless, looking sorrowfully down upon her.\r\nIn the grey light of the brief autumn day the dismal place presented a\r\nwoeful aspect, being almost devoid of furniture, the round discoloured\r\nstove having gone out several days ago. Notwithstanding her plain shabby\r\ndress, it was certain that Mascha was beautiful; all Mstislavl, if called\r\nupon, would bear witness to this fact. About eighteen years of age, she\r\nwas tall, slender, graceful, with beautifully rounded throat and arms,\r\nfair wavy hair drawn back upon her brow, a dazzling complexion, and eyes\r\nof clear child-like blue. When she smiled her charms were enhanced by an\r\nexpression of indescribable simplicity and frankness.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, she presented a sad picture, for her hair had\r\nfallen dishevelled about her handsome face, and her eyes were red with\r\nweeping. As her mother tossed wearily upon her pallet, moaning in pain,\r\nMascha fell upon her knees and kissed the cold, drawn face.\r\n\r\n“Are you suffering much, mother dearest?” she asked, tenderly, smoothing\r\naway the dark hair from the clammy forehead.\r\n\r\n“Yes—I—I’m sinking fast, my child,” she replied in a faint, hoarse voice.\r\n“I shall leave you very soon, Mascha, and you will be alone, with no\r\nother protector except God, to whose mercy I confide you. Trust in Him\r\nin the hours of affliction or misfortune, and by His infinite power He\r\nwill guide your footsteps and protect you from all harm.” She paused, and\r\nadded, “Though you may be scoffed at and persecuted by Orthodox Russians,\r\nnever forget that you are one of God’s chosen, and while resenting\r\ninsult, always refrain from revenge.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t bear to hear you talk like this,” cried my sister, bursting into\r\ntears. “You must not—you shall not die!” Springing suddenly to her feet,\r\nshe stifled her sobs, and said, “You sha’n’t starve! I’ll save you, even\r\nif compelled to beg bread from the Gentiles. I shall not be long, and I\r\nwill bring you food.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, she threw a cloak around her shoulders, and opening the\r\ndoor, disappeared; while her mother closed her wearied eyes and prayed\r\nearnestly for succour.\r\n\r\nThrough the old uncleanly Ghetto—the quarter in which Jews were suffered\r\nto reside—Mascha wandered aimlessly, wondering where she could discover\r\na person generous enough to give her a morsel of bread. She knew it was\r\nuseless to ask for food of the people of her own faith, for they were\r\nall in terrible distress. Owing to the failure of the harvest for two\r\nconsecutive seasons food was so scarce in Western Russia, that in many\r\nplaces the peasants were subsisting on grass and roots, while hundreds\r\nwere dying daily of sheer starvation. But worst of all, the feeling\r\nagainst the Jews had become greatly embittered, from the fact that the\r\nmoujiks, in their ignorant fanaticism, had been taught to believe by the\r\nvillage _popes_ that the Hebrews had brought the famine upon the land.\r\nHence Jew-baiting had become rife. Unfortunate Israelites were cuffed and\r\nassaulted in the open streets, and were unable to obtain redress, and in\r\ndozens of towns in Little and Central Russia the Ghettos had been looted\r\nand afterwards burned.\r\n\r\nIn these anti-Semitic excesses Jews were treated worse than dogs, often\r\nruthlessly murdered without a hand being stretched forth to save them,\r\nwhile women were outraged in sight of their children, and there were\r\ncommitted diabolical atrocities that had raised the indignation of every\r\nEuropean nation. Murder and pillage ran riot through the Tzar’s domains,\r\nside by side with the grim spectre Famine, that had spread starvation and\r\ndeath through the great Empire from the White Sea to the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto at Mstislavl was the oldest quarter of the little town,\r\nconsisting of one dark, evil-smelling street, into which the sun never\r\nseemed to shine. The black wooden houses, with numerous poles projecting\r\nfrom the windows, further increased the darkness of the narrow lane. From\r\nend to end Mascha walked through it, but found no one who could render\r\nher assistance. The place seemed deserted, the houses were all closed;\r\nthe usually noisy colony seemed hushed by death.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Jews’ quarter, she made her way through the town and entered\r\nthe market-place, where a little business was still being carried on.\r\nGroups of moujiks in their dirty sheepskins were standing about idly,\r\ntheir thin, pinched faces showing that they, too, were feeling the effect\r\nof the dearth of food. While wandering along, engrossed in her own sad\r\nthoughts, Mascha chanced to look up, and her eyes fell upon a buxom young\r\nwoman, who held a large piece of bread in her hand, from which she was\r\nfeeding a great black dog.\r\n\r\nThe thought flashed across her mind that she must get food by some means,\r\nand save her mother’s life. Without a moment’s reflection, she stifled\r\nher pride, and rushing wildly across to where the woman stood, begged for\r\na portion of the bread.\r\n\r\n“You!—Give bread to you!” cried the woman, with a harsh, brutal laugh.\r\n“Hebrews are dogs, but this”—and she pointed to the animal at her\r\nfeet—“this is a Christian dog, and I would rather feed him than you.”\r\n\r\n“For my mother’s sake!” implored Mascha. “She’s dying!”\r\n\r\n“Bah! If she dies it will be one Jewess the less. Your people are our\r\ncurse. Go home and die too!”\r\n\r\nAnd the woman spat upon her contemptuously, and turning her back upon the\r\nsupplicant, continued feeding the dog.\r\n\r\nMascha, crestfallen and dejected, was walking slowly away when she\r\nsuddenly felt a heavy hand upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Now, girl; what do you want here?” inquired a rough, coarse voice.\r\n\r\nGlancing up quickly, she recognised the sinister features and shifty\r\nfeline eyes of Ivan Osnavitsch, the _ispravnik_.[2]\r\n\r\n“I want bread; my mother is starving,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Starving? Like all the other dogs that infest the Ghetto kennels, eh?\r\nWell, you’ve no right to beg of Christians. The law of the Mir forbids\r\nit, and I ought to take you to prison as a vagabond. If you want food\r\nyou should go to the Governor. His Excellency has received relief for\r\ndistribution, and if you call upon him he may probably give you some.\r\nTell him that I sent you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you,” she replied, gratefully; “I’ll go at once.”\r\n\r\nTurning, she directed her steps hurriedly towards the palace of the\r\nGovernment, about a mile from the town on the Lubkovo road, while the\r\n_ispravnik_ laughed, muttering as he watched her retreating figure: “His\r\nExcellency is a connoisseur of pretty faces. He will thank me for sending\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nFeeling that not a moment was to be lost, Mascha walked quickly along the\r\nmuddy highway, that ran through a bare, barren country, beside the sedgy\r\nbank of the swiftly-flowing Soj.\r\n\r\nOnly by repute was General Martianoff, the Governor of Mstislavl, known\r\nto her. She knew that by the inhabitants of the Ghetto he was dreaded as\r\na cruel, drunken, and depraved official, and she had heard the Rabbi warn\r\nthem against breaking any of the thousand tyrannical laws which comprise\r\nthe _Swod_, or penal code. A Russian District Governor is locally as\r\nmuch of an autocrat as his Imperial Master, the Tzar. He can do exactly\r\nwhat he pleases with the poor, cringing wretches over whom he is given\r\nauthority. He can condemn Jew or Gentile to prison without trial; he can\r\norder any one who displeases him to be knouted, and with his colleague,\r\nthe _ispravnik_, and his myrmidons, can enforce inhuman tortures not a\r\nwhit the less terrible than those of the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\nGeneral Martianoff, an average specimen of the _nachalniki_, ruled\r\nhis district with the knout, and hating Jews, considered death without\r\ntorture too good for them. He had even ordered unoffending Hebrews to be\r\nflogged because their children omitted to doff their caps to Government\r\nofficials whom they met in the streets!\r\n\r\nIt was of this harsh, inhuman Governor that my poor, trusting sister,\r\nfamished and desperate, sought aid for her dying mother.\r\n\r\nThe General was lazily smoking a cigar and reading the _Novosti_ in his\r\nown well-furnished room, when a man-servant entered, and, after saluting,\r\nsaid, “A young girl desires to see your Excellency. I told her you could\r\nnot give audience to any one.”\r\n\r\n“Idiot! Why did you send her away?”\r\n\r\n“She was only a Jewess, your Excellency. But she is still here. She’s the\r\ndaughter of the financier Prèhznev, of Petersburg, who was sent to the\r\nmines.”\r\n\r\n“Prèhznev!” repeated the General, in surprise. “Ah! Show her in—and—and\r\nsee we are not disturbed, Ivanovitch—you understand.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your Excellency.” And the man saluted and disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds Mascha, pale and trembling, advanced timidly into the\r\nroom. The Governor was standing near the door when she entered, and as he\r\nclosed it after her he pushed the small brass bolt into its socket. Then\r\nhe turned sharply, and asked—\r\n\r\n“Well, girl, what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency,” said Mascha, bowing with that fawning humility which\r\nevery Hebrew is bound to show towards Government officials, “I have been\r\nsent by our good _ispravnik_, Ivan Osnavitsch.”\r\n\r\n“Very kind of him to select beauty for me and send it to my door, I’m\r\nsure,” remarked the General, under his breath.\r\n\r\nContinuing, Mascha briefly explained that she and her mother were\r\nstarving, and that her parent was dying of sheer want.\r\n\r\n“But you are a Jewess,” he said sternly. “The relief which my Imperial\r\nMaster has entrusted me to distribute is only for Orthodox Russians.”\r\n\r\n“Have pity; have mercy upon us,” she cried earnestly. “I know that I, a\r\nJewess, have no right to ask a favour of your Excellency, but my dear\r\nmother is dying!”\r\n\r\n“I cannot prevent that, my pretty one,” he said more kindly, stroking her\r\nfair, dishevelled hair.\r\n\r\nWith a quick movement he placed his arm around her waist, and grasping\r\nher tightly, pressed her against his breast, adding, “Come, I must have a\r\nkiss!”\r\n\r\nBefore she could evade him, she felt his hot breath upon her face, and\r\nhis lips pressed her soft, dimpled cheek. Trembling with fear and flushed\r\nwith indignation, she struggled and succeeded in freeing herself from his\r\nhateful clutches. But she did not upbraid him, although her face became\r\nmore woeful than before.\r\n\r\nFrowning, he regarded her with an expression of displeasure, saying: “The\r\nwife and child of a political exile classed among dangerous Nihilists can\r\nexpect no relief from His Majesty’s private purse.”\r\n\r\n“It is to your sympathy that I appeal,” Mascha exclaimed imploringly.\r\n“Although my people and yours are of different creed, we all adore the\r\nsame Father, our Tzar.”\r\n\r\n“And Isaac Prèhznev was sent to Siberia by _étape_ for conspiring against\r\nhis life! Curious adoration, eh?”\r\n\r\n“It’s false!” she cried hotly. “He was wrongly accused; denounced by\r\nsome unknown enemy, and sent straight to Irkutsk without any chance of\r\ndefence.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! my pretty champion. So that is the way you speak of the justice\r\nof His Majesty! Your words betray you: they show that you, too, have\r\nbecome imbued with the revolutionary teaching of the propaganda.”\r\n\r\nMascha saw she had been trapped. In a moment she knew that he suspected\r\nher of Nihilistic tendencies.\r\n\r\nMartianoff noticed her alarm, and said: “You need not fear. I don’t\r\nintend that you should share your father’s fate. You are too pretty for\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“Have you decided to give me food?” she demanded, her brows knit in\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nHis coarse, sensual features again relaxed into a leering smile, as he\r\nsuddenly flung his arm around her neck. Bending, he placed his lips close\r\nto her ear, and whispered some words.\r\n\r\n“No! no!” she cried wildly. “God protect me!” And she struggled to free\r\nherself from his hateful embrace.\r\n\r\n“You refuse?” he said, in a stern, harsh voice.\r\n\r\n“I would rather die than agree to such terms,” she replied, her eyes\r\nflashing with indignation.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he snarled, as he thrust her from him impatiently. “Go back\r\nto your hovel and die, you daughter of a dog. Begone!”\r\n\r\n“But your Excellency—I——”\r\n\r\n“No more words,” he thundered, adding a curse. “Go! or I’ll fling you\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nStaggering to the door, sorrowful and crestfallen, she drew back the bolt\r\nand went out, her eyes half-blinded by tears.\r\n\r\nThe moment she had gone, the General touched a gong, at the same time\r\nmuttering: “The dainty, obstinate little bird must be brought to her\r\nsenses. She must be put into a cage and tamed.”\r\n\r\n“Ivanovitch,” he said aloud, addressing his servant. “That Jewess is a\r\nNihilist. Order Osnavitsch to have her closely watched.”\r\n\r\nThen he viciously bit the end off another cigar, and taking up the paper,\r\nresumed his reading.\r\n\r\nMascha, after leaving the Palace of the Governor, had wandered about for\r\nseveral hours in search of some one who would give her bread; but all\r\nher efforts were futile, and when she returned to the Ghetto she had\r\nfound that her mother had passed away.\r\n\r\nWith the moonlight full upon her she was kneeling beside the body, her\r\nface buried in the ragged covering, and sobbing as if her heart would\r\nbreak. Unable to restrain her flood of emotion, she did not notice the\r\ncautious opening of the door, or the entrance of a tall, dark figure that\r\ncrept noiselessly up behind her and stood in the shadow watching, and\r\nlistening to her murmurings.\r\n\r\n“It’s cruel,” she said aloud, suddenly drawing a long breath and\r\nclenching her teeth in despair. “To the Tzar is due the dire misfortune\r\nthat has fallen upon our house. He has taken our money and cast us forth\r\nto die like dogs! It is he—the Tzar—the murderer!—who is responsible for\r\nmy mother’s death. He is a vampire who lives on the blood of such as us.”\r\nRaising her white, tear-stained face and looking up to the bright moon,\r\nshe cried despairingly: “What can I do? My father exiled, my mother dead,\r\nAnton on military service, and I am left alone—alone!” she added, in a\r\nhalf-fearful whisper, “to seek revenge!”\r\n\r\n“Very pretty sentiments indeed,” remarked a gruff, harsh voice.\r\n\r\nSpringing to her feet, she confronted General Martianoff.\r\n\r\n“You!” she gasped. “Why—why do you come here?”\r\n\r\n“To see you, my pretty one,” he replied, throwing off his great\r\nsable-lined _shuba_. He endeavoured to place his arm around her waist,\r\nbut she drew back quickly.\r\n\r\n“And you have followed me here,” she said, in a tone full of reproach\r\nand disgust; “here, into the room where my mother lies dead, in order to\r\ncontinue your hateful attentions—to insult me before her corpse!”\r\n\r\n“Ho! ho!” he exclaimed, annoyed. “Then you have not reconsidered your\r\ndecision?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied firmly. “Have I not already told you that I prefer\r\ndeath?”\r\n\r\nHe argued with her, flattered her, laughing all the time at her\r\nindignation, and treating it with flippancy. Suddenly she turned upon him\r\nwith angry passion, saying: “I desire none of your detestable caresses.\r\nIt is such heartless officials as you who curse our country, who carry\r\nout the ukases of the Autocrat with fiendish delight, and who are the\r\ncatspaws of the Persecutor of our race. What mercy ought I to expect\r\nfrom you, General Martianoff, who sent Anna Ivanovna to the mines merely\r\nbecause she displeased you, and who condemned Paul Souvaroff to solitary\r\nconfinement in Petropaulovsk for no offence except that he endeavoured to\r\nsave a defenceless woman from your merciless clutches. It is——”\r\n\r\n“Silence! Wench!” he thundered.\r\n\r\n“I will not be hushed when you insult me! You talk of love—you—whose\r\ndissolute habits are as well-known as the yellow ticket of shame you\r\nwould thrust upon us Jewesses. I begged bread from you, and you refused.\r\nSee! there is the result!” and she pointed to where the body lay.\r\n\r\nHis face had grown livid, and rushing towards her, he grasped her roughly\r\nby the shoulder. “I have not come here on a fool’s errand,” he said\r\nfiercely; “I don’t intend that you shall evade me—you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Let me go!” she demanded, struggling to get free. “Help! help!” she\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n“Silence! Curse you!” he growled, striking her a heavy blow upon the\r\nmouth. Although stunned for a few moments she continued to struggle\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he lifted her from her feet and tried to drag her by sheer force\r\nto the door leading to the room beyond. She saw his intention, and for\r\nseveral minutes fought fiercely with a renewed strength of which she had\r\nnot believed herself capable.\r\n\r\nPresently, in the heat of the struggle, something heavy fell from his\r\npocket. She stooped and snatched it up. At that moment she felt her\r\nstrength failing, and exerted every muscle.\r\n\r\n“Will you let me go?” she shrieked, her lips cut and swollen by the cruel\r\nblow he had dealt her.\r\n\r\n“No, I will not,” he replied, with an imprecation.\r\n\r\nAs he uttered the words something bright glittered in her hand. He\r\ngrasped her arm, endeavouring to gain possession of it, but was too late.\r\n\r\nThere was a flash, a loud report, and General Martianoff staggered back\r\nagainst the wall with an agonised cry.\r\n\r\n“You—you’ve shot me!” he gasped hoarsely, and then sank upon a chair,\r\ninert and helpless, with blood streaming from a wound in his shoulder.\r\n\r\nMascha, in desperation, had resorted to the last extremity in defence of\r\nher honour.\r\n\r\nThat night was an eventful one in Mstislavl.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant moujiks, encouraged by the officials of the Government,\r\nhad heaped every indignity possible upon the Jews, and the anti-Semitic\r\nfeeling reached a climax when it became known that a Jewess had attempted\r\nto assassinate the Governor.\r\n\r\nLed by a wild-haired local agitator, a mob of a thousand persons\r\nproceeded to the Ghetto and carried out a frightful work of destruction.\r\nThey surged down the narrow street, and after entering the houses and\r\ntreating the inmates with shocking brutality, looted and set fire to\r\ntheir homes. The enraged rioters wrecked the Synagogue and killed the\r\nRabbi, shouting, “Clear out the rats’ nest! Kill them all!” Screams of\r\npain mingled with wild yells of triumph, and through the long night the\r\nGhetto was a veritable Pandemonium.\r\n\r\nThe scene was terrible. The street ran with blood. Many Jewish women fell\r\nvictims to the brutal lust and frantic frenzy of the mob, and were so\r\nbarbarously maltreated that eleven succumbed, while a dozen men were shot\r\nor stabbed.\r\n\r\nBefore dawn the Ghetto had been totally destroyed and its unfortunate\r\ninhabitants, having lost everything they had, were compelled to seek\r\nshelter in the forest on the Kritchev road, where many afterwards died of\r\nexposure and starvation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Martianoff lost no time in wreaking vengeance upon my hapless\r\nsister. She had been arrested and taken to prison immediately after\r\nfiring the shot, and he had condemned her to receive fifty lashes of the\r\nknout. Such a sentence was tantamount to death, for punishment by the\r\nknout is so barbarous a torture that few strong men could survive so many\r\nstrokes. Yet whippings were of everyday occurrence in the Tzar’s empire,\r\nand even women are not spared by the officials.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o’clock on the following morning when Mascha emerged\r\nfrom the grimy portals of the prison, and under a strong escort walked\r\nacross the market-place to the temporary platform that had been erected.\r\nA great crowd had assembled to witness the chastisement of “the pretty\r\nJewess,” and as she mounted the steps, with pale, determined face, they\r\ngreeted her with fierce yells of triumph.\r\n\r\nShe looked round upon the sea of upturned countenances contemptuously.\r\n\r\nOn the platform there had been set up a square wooden frame.\r\nUnceremoniously, the brutal moujiks, who assisted the executioner,\r\ngrasped her with their coarse, dirty hands and tore off her clothing,\r\nexposing her bare, white back down to the waist.\r\n\r\nThe mob roared with approbation when they saw this preparation. A few\r\nmoments later she was forced upon the black frame, and her wrists and\r\nankles secured so tightly that the tension almost caused dislocation of\r\nthe joints. Then the executioner, whose duty it was to carry out the\r\nsentence, seized the knout—a number of triangular thongs of leather fixed\r\ninto a short whip handle—and looked round for the signal to commence. As\r\nhe did so, General Martianoff, with his shoulder bandaged, made his way\r\nthrough the expectant crowd, and shouted—\r\n\r\n“Come, get to work. Don’t spare her, but keep the death-blow till last.”\r\n\r\nHushed and open-mouthed, the spectators awaited the result of the first\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nThe executioner receded, swung the terrible torture instrument over his\r\nhead, and giving it a peculiar twist, brought it down upon the victim’s\r\nback with a sound like a pistol-shot.\r\n\r\nThe cruel thongs cut their way into the flesh and the blood gushed\r\nforth. Time after time the blows fell monotonously, until the quivering\r\nflesh was beaten to a pulp, and both victim and executioner were covered\r\nwith blood.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene of fiendish brutality that met my gaze on my arrival\r\nat Mstislavl, after having traced my mother and sister from Petersburg.\r\n\r\nI was making my way through the shouting populace when, out of mere\r\ncuriosity, I glanced at the face of the unfortunate girl, and recognised\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWas it surprising that I rushed wildly up and endeavoured to stop the\r\nhorrible punishment? So suddenly did it all happen, however, that I\r\nremember very little about it, except that in my wrathful indignation I\r\ncursed the Tzar’s myrmidons, and struck in the face the inhuman Governor\r\nwho attempted to throw me from the platform. Thinking that I was Mascha’s\r\nlover, and enraged at the blow, he thereupon ordered me to receive thirty\r\nlashes.\r\n\r\nI saw them carry away the insensible, mutilated form of my poor sister.\r\nThen they tied me to the frame.\r\n\r\nI felt the thongs cut into my back like knives. Once! Twice! Thrice! The\r\npain became excruciating. My head reeled, and a moment later all became\r\nblank.\r\n\r\nWhen I regained consciousness I found myself in the prison hospital with\r\nwarders rubbing salt into my wounds. I asked after Mascha, and was\r\ninformed that she was still alive, and recovering.\r\n\r\nOne morning, while exercising in the prison yard, I saw her for a few\r\nbrief moments, and she told me the story I have narrated.\r\n\r\nTwo days later my warder announced that we had both been condemned by\r\nGeneral Martianoff as assisting in the dissemination of revolutionary\r\npropaganda, and sentenced to hard labour for life in the Siberian mines!\r\n\r\nThen I made a solemn vow of revenge, and from that moment became a\r\nNihilist.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] “Security Section” of the Secret Police.\r\n\r\n[2] Chief of police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nON TRACKLESS SNOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring six weary months I had been kept in solitary confinement in\r\na small, cold, ill-lit cell in the Fortress of Peter and Paul at\r\nPetersburg, whither I had been transferred from Mstislavl. Dispirited by\r\nsolitude, weakened by lack of exercise, and ill through want of proper\r\nmedical attention, I began to fear that the confinement would cause my\r\nreason to give way; therefore it was with a feeling of relief that one\r\nday I greeted the announcement of my warder that we were to start for\r\nSiberia on the morrow.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the frightful hardships of my long and terrible\r\njourney would fill a volume, but it is only my intention to outline them\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\nWith a hundred other men and women of all ages we left the grim fortress\r\nat midnight, a sorry, smileless band, whose clanking chains formed an\r\nominous accompaniment to the loud shouts and cracking of whips of our\r\nCossack escorts. We were each attired in grey kaftan, strong knee-boots,\r\nand sheepskin bonnet. Our breasts bore a metal plate with a number, while\r\nstrapped over our shoulders was the rug, the mess tin, and the wooden\r\nspoon that comprised our travelling kit.\r\n\r\nWith ankles fettered by long heavy chains held to the waist by means\r\nof a rope, we were fastened together in gangs and passed out upon the\r\nChudova road on the first stage of the weary tramp to that bourne whence\r\nfew exiles return. The rumbling of the springless carts in the rear,\r\nfor those who might fall ill on the way, awoke the echoes of the silent\r\nthoroughfares, and following us were several Cossacks who with lanterns\r\ncarefully examined the road over which we had passed, in order that no\r\nletter should be dropped clandestinely.\r\n\r\nThe night was wet and stormy as our weird, dismal procession passed\r\nthrough the slumbering city and out upon the broad highway on its journey\r\neastward to the Ourals. Our wet clothes clung to us as we walked;\r\nthe icy wind that blew across the wide open plain chilled our bones.\r\nNevertheless, we plodded doggedly onward in silence, for conversation\r\nhad been forbidden, and those who had spoken had felt the heavy thongs\r\nof the escort’s knout. The settled look of despair, and the sighs that\r\nfrequently escaped my fellow-exiles, plainly showed what were their\r\nfeelings at being banished from their native land.\r\n\r\nSince the day I had seen Mascha in the prison-yard I had heard nothing of\r\nher. A thousand times I had wondered what had been her fate; yet now,\r\nin my despair, I had relinquished all hope of seeing her again. Indeed,\r\nirreparable ruin had descended upon myself and my family so swiftly, that\r\nalready I had grown callous as to my ultimate fate.\r\n\r\nWithout trial, I had been sentenced by the Provincial Governor of\r\nMoghilev, upon the report of General Martianoff, to hard labour for\r\nlife. Such, alas! was my punishment for endeavouring to rescue my poor\r\ndefenceless sister from the inhuman wrath of the dissolute representative\r\nof the Tzar! I was well aware that for the Russian political convict\r\nis reserved a death by slow torture to which any other means of ending\r\nlife is preferable. The silver mines in the terrible district beyond\r\nLake Baikal are the tombs of political suspects. The Government is\r\nwell aware that the conditions under which convicts work at Kara,\r\nNerchinsk, Pokrovski, and the other distant mining settlements to which\r\n“politicals” are sent, are such as to cause death in from five to seven\r\nyears. With that refinement of cruelty for which the Government has\r\nearned an unenviable notoriety, it has abolished the death sentence and\r\nsubstituted one more torturing in that distant land where God is high\r\nand the Tzar is far away. The prisons and _étapes_ of Siberia are foul,\r\ninsanitary, half-ruined wooden structures where human beings perish like\r\nflies. Typhoid, diphtheria, and other epidemic diseases prevail there\r\nconstantly, and infect all who have the misfortune to be huddled into\r\nthe awful places. The grievously sick, for want of attendance, wallow on\r\nthe floor in the midst of filth, and their clothes rot on their bodies;\r\nwhile so over-crowded are these pestilential _kameras_ by persons of all\r\nages and both sexes, that for those who are not fever-stricken there is\r\nneither room to sit nor lie.\r\n\r\nThe exiles who are consigned underground are convicts of the worst type,\r\nand political offenders of the best. The murderer for his villainy, the\r\nintelligent honest Muscovite who expresses Liberal opinions—not a whit\r\nmore revolutionary than the ideas of English Radicals—are deemed equally\r\nworthy of slow, agonising death.\r\n\r\nHaving reached Chudova, we were conveyed by train to Nijni Novgorod, and\r\nthere placed in a sort of cage on board a large barge, and taken down the\r\nVolga and up the Kama to Perm, whence we took train to Ekaterinbourg, a\r\ntown of considerable proportions beyond the Ourals.\r\n\r\nHere our weary journey on foot across Siberia commenced, and long before\r\nthe Asiatic frontier was reached, the paucity of human habitations, the\r\nbarrenness of the soil, and the increasing bleakness of the climate, had\r\nhad their effect upon even the hardiest among us. But we still pushed\r\nonward, ill, hungry, footsore.\r\n\r\nI well remember the day we crossed the frontier, and bade farewell to our\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\nAlready we had walked three hundred versts from Ekaterinbourg, along the\r\nGreat Post Road, at that season covered by a deep snow, and only marked\r\nby the long straight line of black telegraph posts and wires. Away, as\r\nfar as the eye could reach, nothing was visible but the broad plain of\r\ndazzling whiteness, and the grey, snow-laden sky, when suddenly we came\r\nto a tall, square, brick-built obelisk, bearing on one side the arms of\r\nthe European province of Perm, and on the other those of the Asiatic\r\nprovince of Tobolsk. It was the boundary-post of that great lonely\r\nprison-land, Siberia.\r\n\r\nNo other boundary-mark in the world has witnessed so much human\r\nsuffering, or, according to Mr. George Kennan, has been passed by such\r\na multitude of heart-broken people. As it is situated about half-way\r\nbetween the last European and the first Siberian _étape_, the captain\r\nallowed our convoy to halt for rest, and for a last farewell to home and\r\ncountry. The Russian peasant, even when a criminal, is patriotic, and\r\ndeeply attached to his native land; and there was a heart-rending scene\r\nwhen our wearied band stopped before the crumbling obelisk. Some gave\r\nway to wild hysterical grief; some comforted the weeping; others knelt\r\nand pressed their faces to the loved soil of their native land, and\r\ncollected a little earth to take with them into exile, while a few of the\r\nwomen, pale, tragic figures in their black-hooded cloaks, pressed their\r\nthin, pale lips to the European side of the cold brick pillar, kissing\r\ngood-bye to all it symbolised.\r\n\r\nThe officer commanding our escort, who had been smoking a cigarette, and\r\nlooking with calm indifference upon this touching scene, suddenly shouted\r\nthe stern order, “_Stroisa!_” (“Form Ranks”), and at the word “March,” a\r\nfew moments later, we crossed ourselves, and with a confused jingling of\r\nchains and leg-fetters, moved slowly away, past the boundary post, into\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nDay after day, week after week, hungry, cold, and fatigued, we trudged\r\nacross the bleak, snow-covered steppes, until life became so burdensome\r\nthat we longed for death.\r\n\r\nSometimes we passed the night in an insanitary _étape_ in one of the\r\nwretched little villages along the road, but often we camped out in the\r\nopen, and, after our meagre ration of soup, wrapped our rugs around us,\r\nand slept upon the ground around the fire we had lit. The hardships\r\nof the long, monotonous marches were bad enough for men to bear, but\r\nthe women—who numbered about twenty, including several of noble birth,\r\ncondemned to the mines as Nihilist conspirators—fared worst of all.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Madame Marie Koutowzow, was a young widow I had met in\r\nPetersburg society. She told me that she had incurred the special\r\nanimosity of a _tschinovnik_, or Government official, by refusing to\r\nmarry him, and he, anxious to avenge himself, had caused her arrest, and\r\nhad heaped up the hardships which might hurry her out of life. Death had\r\nreleased three of these delicately nurtured ladies from their misery, and\r\nwe had buried them, without coffin or religious ceremony, ere we reached\r\nTobolsk.\r\n\r\nWhen at length we arrived at the latter town, we were lodged in the great\r\nconvict prison, and allowed to rest for two days, after which we resumed\r\nour journey eastward to Tomsk, arriving there three weeks later, with our\r\nclothing in rags, and almost shoeless.\r\n\r\nAlthough our experiences had been terrible enough during our forced\r\nmarches, the most horrible of all was our sojourn at the perisilni at\r\nTomsk—the prison where exiles remain until their fate is decided upon by\r\nthe authorities. The horrors of this den of vileness were indescribable.\r\nThe _kamera_, or public cell, into which we were driven like cattle, was\r\na long low room, ill-ventilated, and disgustingly dirty. Already there\r\nwere fully fifty convicts in it, and the smell of humanity that greeted\r\nus as the great iron door was opened I shall never forget. When I looked\r\naround and noted the dreadful groups, ragged, unkempt, unwashed, some\r\nlying on the sloping wooden shelves which formed the common beds, others\r\ncrouching on the filthy floor, I shuddered with horror, and was appalled.\r\n\r\nAmid this filth disease was rife. No fewer than four men and two women\r\nwere at that moment dying of typhoid, while the body of a girl who had\r\nsuccumbed was lying unheeded in a corner. No notice whatever was taken\r\nof invalids by the officials, and I afterwards learnt that this room,\r\noriginally intended as an infirmary, had been converted into a common\r\ncell for the accommodation of the ever-increasing crowds of exiles,\r\n12,000 of which pass through the prison annually.\r\n\r\nCoarse brown bread and tschi were our two articles of diet. The former\r\nwas flung to us as to dogs, and owing to the rations never being\r\nsufficient to satisfy all, a fierce fight for a morsel of food invariably\r\nresulted. Ravenously hungry men struggled with one another to secure\r\nbread for their wives and children who had voluntarily accompanied them\r\ninto exile, while friendless females, too ill to move, were left in\r\ncorners to die.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly surprising that Marie Koutowzow, a refined and delicate\r\nwoman, should become infected by the fever that was raging. Very soon she\r\ngrew too ill to participate in the daily fight for food, and I obtained\r\nher rations for her. Lying upon one of the plank beds at the further end\r\nof the _kamera_, she bore the ravages of the disease bravely, praying\r\nthat death might release her. Her desire was fulfilled, for six days\r\nafter she had been attacked the malady proved fatal.\r\n\r\nFor three whole days the body was allowed to remain in that crowded\r\nden of filth. None dare complain. We knew too well that the reward\r\nfor pointing out the fact to the officials would be an unceremonious\r\nknouting, for in Siberia the lash is used at the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nIn the same ragged dress that I had worn during my three months’ tramp\r\nfrom European Russia, and which was insufficient to protect me from the\r\nintense cold, I was taken from this Dantean _kamera_ at dawn one day and\r\nchained to a large gang of convicts. Then I learned that my sentence was\r\nsubterranean hard labour at Kara, the most terrible mines in the whole of\r\nSiberia!\r\n\r\nTo the exiles who had been my companions from St. Petersburg I bade\r\nfarewell, and as one of a convoy of criminals of the most dangerous\r\nclass, I left the forwarding-prison and wearily dragged my chains across\r\nthe endless snow-covered steppes, _en route_ for the dreaded district\r\nbeyond Irkutsk. The thought that each step took me nearer to my living\r\ntomb rendered me desperate. Why should I, innocent of crime, be tortured\r\nto death in the same manner as murderers and hardened criminals?\r\n\r\nI resolved to endeavour to escape. It was a mad project, I admit,\r\nfor there was but little chance of crossing the wastes of snow which\r\nstretched away three thousand miles before civilisation could be reached.\r\nNevertheless I determined to risk all. If I died in the snow, or starved,\r\nit would end my miserable existence, and prevent further tortures being\r\nheaped upon me.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind hope returned, and I walked on day after day,\r\nwatching for a chance to carry my hazardous design into effect. After\r\nleaving Krasnoyarsk the chains that bound us to one another were removed,\r\nand we were allowed to walk in groups. One day while trudging along the\r\nroad leading to Irkutsk we halted at a post-station. The weather being\r\nintensely cold, the captain commanding the Cossacks sometimes allowed\r\nthose of us who had money to purchase _vodka_. On this occasion, however,\r\nwhen we knocked at the door, our summons remained unanswered. It was\r\nevident that the two men placed in charge of the low log house had\r\ngone to visit their neighbours, the nearest of whom were twenty versts\r\ndistant; so after a further endeavour to open the door, we were compelled\r\nto resume our weary tramp. About ten versts farther on we encamped for\r\nthe night on the border of a gloomy pine forest. This was the first\r\noccasion we had slept near anything that might act as cover, therefore\r\nI resolved, when my comrades were asleep, to slip past the sentries,\r\nand make a dash for liberty. Tying my leg chain tighter to my waist to\r\nprevent it jingling, I threw myself down after eating my evening ration,\r\nand waited with breathless impatience. The minutes seemed hours, until at\r\nlast the camp became hushed in slumber; then I carefully rose, while the\r\nCossack sentry’s back was turned, and plunged swiftly and silently into\r\nthe great, dismal forest.\r\n\r\nIt was an exciting moment. Every second I expected to hear the hue\r\nand cry raised, but as I gradually increased the distance between my\r\ncaptors and myself, it seemed as though my escape remained undiscovered.\r\nFor an hour I walked in a straight line through the trees, and at\r\nlength I doubled, in the hope of finding the post-road I had left. My\r\nanticipations were realised, and during the remainder of the long, dark\r\nSiberian night I sped along as fast as my tired legs would carry me over\r\nthe road we had travelled on the previous day.\r\n\r\nThe almost insurmountable obstacles to my escape never entered my head,\r\nso elated was I at the prospect of freedom.\r\n\r\nDawn came, and the weak, yellow rays of the sun were struggling forth,\r\nwhen by chance I turned and looked behind me.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw caused me breathless terror and dismay. In the distance,\r\nlooking like three black ants on the snowy horizon, were a trio of\r\nmounted Cossacks riding at full gallop.\r\n\r\nIt was evident they had seen me!\r\n\r\nI looked round for some means of concealment, but there was none. In the\r\ndistance, about a verst away, I saw the deserted post-house we had passed\r\non the day previous. Without knowing what impelled me, I started running\r\nas hard as I could in that direction; but as I glanced round from time\r\nto time I saw the Cossacks were fast gaining upon me.\r\n\r\nThey shouted to me to stop, but I took no heed. Some superhuman strength\r\nseemed to possess me, and I ran swiftly and lightly over the snow towards\r\nthe house. Gradually they drew nearer, and then I heard the report of a\r\nrifle, but finding myself unhurt, I redoubled my pace.\r\n\r\nAs the triumphant yells of the galloping Cossacks broke upon my ears, I\r\ngained the rear of the house and halted for a moment to discover some\r\nsafe retreat.\r\n\r\nThere was none. The doors were fastened as they had been on the day\r\nbefore. Not a moment was to be lost, for already I heard the thud of the\r\nhorses’ hoofs upon the snow. I had to choose between a brief life of\r\nhorrible torture that would follow my recapture, and instant death! I\r\nchose the latter.\r\n\r\nGlancing round wildly, I sought means of suicide. As I did so the yelling\r\nsoldiers, with revolvers drawn, came tearing round the side of the house.\r\n\r\n“Surrender! or we’ll fire!” they cried.\r\n\r\nI looked determinedly into their faces. It was a case of life or death,\r\nand they were driving me to the latter.\r\n\r\nBefore they could anticipate my intention or level their weapons at me, I\r\nmade a dash for a deep well, situate about twenty yards distant, shouting\r\nin my despair—\r\n\r\n“I’ll kill myself rather than go back!”\r\n\r\nA moment later I had jumped headlong into it.\r\n\r\nHow long I remained in a state of semi-consciousness I had no idea. I\r\nremember lying silent and motionless listening to the voices of the\r\nsoldiers above, and scarce daring to breathe.\r\n\r\n“See!” cried one, “it’s useless to get him out. His neck is broken or he\r\ncould never be crushed into a heap like that.”\r\n\r\nThe second man suggested that I might be merely stunned, but the third\r\nexclaimed—\r\n\r\n“He’s dead enough, poor devil. Why should we trouble ourselves to take\r\nhim out? Leave that work for the post-house keeper when he returns.”\r\n\r\n“He was no fool either,” observed the first man grimly. “I should kill\r\nmyself if I had the same choice.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the second man did not persist in his demand for my extrication,\r\nhe fired his revolver down the well, afterwards remounting and riding\r\nslowly back with his companions.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought they had departed I rose, and to my intense delight found\r\nmyself uninjured. The well being frozen, the ice was covered with a thick\r\nlayer of snow, and this had considerably diminished the concussion of my\r\nfall. The Cossack’s bullet had not struck me, and beyond a bruise on my\r\nelbow I was none the worse for my reckless leap.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I discovered that the chain used to draw up water was\r\nunwound from the windlass and suspended close to my hand. With an\r\nexclamation of joy I grasped it, and after ascertaining that it was fast\r\nat the top, quickly clambered to the surface and in a few moments again\r\nstood before the post-house.\r\n\r\nThen the thought suggested itself that if I could effect an entrance I\r\nmight discover food and clothing, for it was impossible for me to go far\r\nin a convict’s dress with a yellow diamond upon the back, without being\r\nrearrested. I tried both doors, but they were securely fastened. After a\r\nsearch, however, I came across a long piece of iron in an outhouse, and\r\nwith it contrived to wrench off the latch of a window-shutter. Afterwards\r\nI broke open the double windows and clambered in. The one large room\r\nfacing the road was a bare-boarded, dirty apartment, and, like all\r\nSiberian post-houses, devoid of any furniture beyond a plain deal table,\r\na couple of rush-bottomed chairs, and a bench. In the centre stood a\r\nlarge, round stove, while on the wall was a badly executed picture of the\r\nVirgin. There was some food upon the table, and the room bore evidence of\r\nrecent occupation.\r\n\r\nAs I passed into the sleeping apartment beyond, I started and drew back\r\nin alarm, for lying upon the unclean straw mattress, fully dressed, and\r\ncovered with a heavy fur overcoat, lay a man. His face was turned from\r\nme, but after a moment’s hesitation I shook him gently by the shoulder.\r\nHe did not stir.\r\n\r\nI placed my hand upon his face, but drew it back instantly, for its\r\ncontact thrilled me. It was icy cold! The man was dead!\r\n\r\nAs I realised the truth, my eyes fell upon a piece of paper lying upon\r\nthe chair beside him. Taking it up, I read the following words written in\r\npencil in a feeble, shaky hand—\r\n\r\n“_I shall die before you can return with medical aid. I order you in the\r\nname of the Tzar to send on the despatches by a trusty messenger. You\r\nwill be repaid.—IVAN DRUKOVITCH._”\r\n\r\nOn searching the body I found the dispatches referred to secreted in the\r\nmoney-belt around his waist. There were three official letters, secured\r\nby the Imperial seal, and addressed to General Sergius Okoulow, Governor\r\nof the District of Kolymsk, the Arctic exile settlement in the Province\r\nof Yakoutsk. With the letters I found about 500 roubles in notes, and a\r\npassport which declared the bearer to be “Ivan Drukovitch, messenger in\r\nthe service of His Imperial Majesty the Tzar, on official business to the\r\nGovernor of Kolymsk.”\r\n\r\nIt did not take me long to decide what course to adopt. Divesting myself\r\nof my rags—which I put in the stove and set fire to—I attired myself in\r\nthe dead man’s uniform, strapped the money-belt with its contents around\r\nmy waist, together with a revolver, and destroyed the note the dead man\r\nhad written. After a brief search I discovered a file among the tools\r\nbelonging to the post-house keeper, and in half an hour had succeeded in\r\nfreeing my ankles of the galling fetters. Getting out of the window, I\r\nwent to the stable, where I found the courier’s horse, and having saddled\r\nit mounted and rode away in the direction the convoy had taken.\r\n\r\nFortunately, my head had not been shaved, as is usual with criminals\r\nentering upon the life sentence. The transformation from convict to\r\nImperial messenger was complete. My official dress, with its brass\r\ndouble-headed eagle on the cap, was an effectual disguise. The wide\r\ncollar of my riding-coat was turned up, and just as it was growing dusk I\r\novertook the convoy. As I saluted the officers they responded, and I rode\r\npast, inwardly chuckling, and soon left the sorry band of malefactors far\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nMine was a terribly lonely and monotonous journey. Instead of following\r\nthe road to Irkutsk, I rode due north until I came to the mighty Lena,\r\nafterwards travelling along its bank a distance of 700 English miles,\r\nuntil I reached Yakoutsk. Remaining there for a couple of days, I again\r\nbade farewell to all human companionship, and set out for the terrible\r\nregions within the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I had recognised that it would be useless to attempt to\r\nreturn to Petersburg by recrossing the Ourals, for the passport was\r\nendorsed with dates so recent that if I presented it at the European\r\nfrontier it would be at once discovered that I had not had time to\r\ntravel to Kolymsk. This, combined with various other reasons, caused me\r\nto assume the _rôle_ of courier and deliver the Tzar’s dispatches to the\r\nperson to whom they were addressed.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to refer in detail to my journey of 2,500 versts from\r\nYakoutsk across the great uninhabited desert and over the moss-covered\r\n_tundras_, or Arctic swamps, to the most northerly exile settlement.\r\nLonely and weary, I sometimes rode for three and four days without\r\nreaching a post-house or seeing a single human being, and frequently I\r\nwas in a half-starved, half-frozen condition. Time passed, and I kept no\r\ncount of it. My thoughts were only of eventual freedom. Having destroyed\r\nthe note left by the dying man, together with my convict’s rags, I knew\r\nthe post-house keeper would be puzzled at finding the corpse had been\r\nplundered, and as there was no telegraph to Yakoutsk, I was confident\r\nthat I should not be forestalled by the news of the courier’s death.\r\n\r\nAfter an incessant journey, lasting two months, I arrived at Sredne\r\nKolmysk, a small town of log huts situate at a point far beyond the\r\nArctic circle, where the deep river Ankudine flows into the Kolyma.\r\nThe houses, scattered about in disorder, are inhabited by Cossacks,\r\nMieshchany, Yakouts, and exiles. The highest erection is a log church,\r\nand the only curiosity a small wooden tower, crooked with age, which\r\nstands within the church enclosure, and was built by the conquerors of\r\nthe country as a protection from raids of hostile tribes. The condition\r\nof the unfortunate exiles there was terrible, even for Siberia. In that\r\nland, where winter commences in August and lasts till May, and where the\r\ntemperature varies from nine degrees above freezing-point to thirteen\r\ndegrees below, man is utterly powerless. Only a handful of wretched\r\nsavages inhabit the fearful region, having been driven to outer darkness\r\nby the tribes with more vitality and energy.\r\n\r\nIt takes about eighteen months to reach this extremity of the habitable\r\nglobe, and by introducing, as a part of the penal system, exile to\r\nthe Arctic zone, the Russian Government has overstepped even its\r\nbroad allowance of iniquity. This hamlet is a penitentiary colony for\r\npolitical exiles, whose punishment is purposely aggravated by physical\r\nsuffering, and who are compelled to exist in a perpetual state of famine\r\nin dwellings that are simply wretched huts built of upright beams, with\r\nrafters laid across and covered with layers of earth. From the Government\r\nstore musty rye flour is eked out to them at intervals, and for the rest,\r\nthey subsist upon what fish they can catch in the river.\r\n\r\nI was not long in discovering General Okoulow’s residence, and, acting as\r\nImperial messenger, delivered the dispatches in as ceremonious a manner\r\nas I could. As I had anticipated, they contained several pardons, and\r\nwhen this became known in the little colony I was _fêted_ and treated\r\nwith every courtesy and kindness. Although such a reception was pleasant\r\nafter the wearying monotony of the Verkho-yansk Desert, yet I was anxious\r\nfor an opportunity to shake the snow of Siberia from my feet. Having\r\nwaited several days while the Governor was preparing his reports for\r\nPetersburg, I one morning made a request—not without trepidation, I\r\nadmit—that he should endorse my passport so as to enable me to go on a\r\nbrief visit to a brother in Petropaulovsk before returning to Russia. To\r\nmy joy, the accommodating Governor saw no objection to this course, and\r\nwith a light heart I set out at dawn on the following day towards the\r\nStanovoi mountains.\r\n\r\nCrossing them, I rode onwards for four weeks through the wild grey\r\nmountains until my jaded horse sank and died of sheer exhaustion. Being\r\ncompelled to perform the remainder of the terrible journey on foot, I\r\nwalked by slow, weary stages across the great lone land, where nothing\r\nmarked my route except the sun, and the country being totally uninhabited\r\nI had to eat grass and willow-leaves for sustenance. Suddenly, however,\r\nat the close of a dull, stormy day, I had the satisfaction of seeing, for\r\nthe first time, the broad, grey waters of the Pacific stretching away to\r\na limitless horizon.\r\n\r\nEven when I had arrived at Petropaulovsk I had by no means eluded the\r\npolice. The journey to Kolymsk I had undertaken because I recognised\r\nhow extremely dangerous it would have been to travel to the coast with\r\na passport which distinctly stated my route and destination. The police\r\nat Siberian ports are ever-watchful for escaping convicts, but in my\r\neagerness for freedom it never occurred to me that information would be\r\ntelegraphed to that extreme corner of the empire of the theft of the dead\r\nman’s papers. This carelessness nearly resulted in disaster.\r\n\r\nIt was late one afternoon when I descended the hill at the entrance\r\nto the town, and passed along the quay. In doing so I noticed a ship\r\nanchored about a mile distant. Of a fisherman I casually inquired\r\nwhat the vessel was, and when she would sail. He replied that it was\r\na Canadian sealer, and that it would sail on the morrow. During the\r\nremainder of the day I wandered about the dirty, wretched town in search\r\nof some means of escape. I had only twenty roubles left, but with these I\r\nintended to bribe some foreign sailor to let me embark as a stowaway.\r\n\r\nWhen it had grown dark and I was looking about for lodging for the\r\nnight, I discovered, to my dismay, that I was being closely watched by a\r\npolice spy. In order to allay suspicion, I sought the police bureau, and\r\nentering boldly, presented my passport. The _ispravnik_ chanced to be\r\nthere, and when he glanced at it a curious smile passed over his features.\r\n\r\n“The Imperial courier, Ivan Drukovitch, is dead,” he said, looking at me\r\nsearchingly. “Consider yourself arrested!”\r\n\r\nI waited for no more. Ere he had uttered the last sentence I had dashed\r\nout of the door and down the street. Half-a-dozen policemen were\r\ninstantly in full cry after me, but in desperation I was determined not\r\nto be apprehended just as I was within an ace of securing my freedom.\r\nExerting every muscle, I ran up and down the narrow streets until I\r\nsuddenly found myself upon the quay. In the glimmering starlight my eyes\r\ncaught sight of a moored boat. Without a moment’s hesitation I jumped\r\ninto it and cut the cord that held it. Before my pursuers could gain the\r\nwater-side the swift current had taken the boat down beside some great\r\npiles and I was effectually hidden in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was an intensely exciting moment.\r\n\r\nI heard the hurrying footsteps pass close to where I was concealed, and\r\nlistened to them receding in the distance. Then I breathed again. Taking\r\nthe oars, and dreading lest I should be discovered, I pulled swiftly\r\nacross the bay to the moored ship I had noticed in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe captain, a genial, kind-hearted man, took compassion upon me when I\r\nhad related my story, and a few hours later I had the gratification of\r\nwatching the twinkling lights of Petropaulovsk disappear at the stern.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later I landed at Victoria, Vancouver, and after a short\r\nresidence there was provided with funds by our Organisation, and left for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMY FRIEND, THE PRINCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of Londoners are unaware that the headquarters of the most\r\npowerful secret organisation in the world exist in their midst. The\r\nunsuspecting persons who pass up and down a certain eminently respectable\r\nthoroughfare in a north-west suburb, would be somewhat surprised if they\r\nknew that in one of these houses the Executive Committee of the Russian\r\nRevolutionists holds daily council and matures the plots which from time\r\nto time startle Europe.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughfare, which, for obvious reasons, I shall designate as\r\nOakleigh Gardens, is formed of large, old-fashioned, detached houses\r\nwhich stand somewhat back, with gardens in front. It is lined on each\r\nside by fine old elms, and the residences are for the most part built\r\nof red brick, with those square, white-framed, unornamented windows of\r\nthe Georgian era. The house in question is hidden from the quiet road\r\nby a high wall in which is a heavy wooden door, but inside one finds a\r\nwell-kept flower garden and a roomy old house which bears an unmistakable\r\nair of wealth and prosperity. Here exiles, whose escape from Siberia\r\nFortune has favoured, find an asylum.\r\n\r\nIn this house I took up my abode when I arrived in London. Smarting under\r\nthe terrible punishment to which I had been unjustly subjected, I had\r\nlong ago taken the oath, and thereby fettered myself body and soul to the\r\nParty. I was determined to revenge myself upon the oppressors who had\r\nstarved my mother, knouted my sister, and sent my father to the mines,\r\nalthough all had been perfectly innocent of any crime. Thus, from a\r\ndevil-may-care recruit I had developed into an ardent revolutionist whose\r\nsole ambition was to assist in the struggle for freedom, and who was\r\nprepared to go to any length in order to accomplish the object towards\r\nwhich the Organisation was striving.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age I had been taught English and French, being now able\r\nto speak both languages almost as fluently as my own. This knowledge\r\nI found of the utmost service, inasmuch as I had been selected by the\r\nExecutive to perform certain special duties of secret service. They did\r\nnot hide the fact that the work would require considerable courage and\r\ntact, and that my life might sometimes be at stake. But I was fearlessly\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\nAfter a six months’ residence in Oakleigh Gardens, during which time I\r\ngained a knowledge of London life and made myself acquainted with the\r\nmajority of those devoted to our Cause resident in the metropolis, the\r\nfirst matter was placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nA few months previously, Ivan Grigorovitch, one of our Party, had\r\nbeen chosen to convey some instructions to the Petersburg centre.\r\nAs he was well known to the Secret Police, he disguised himself as\r\na French commercial traveller, and with a French passport journeyed\r\nfrom Marseilles to Odessa by steamer, intending to proceed thence\r\nto Petersburg, the ordinary route from London being considered too\r\ndangerous. His intentions, however, were frustrated, inasmuch as the\r\nOdessa police, who had been apprised of his advent, arrested him\r\nimmediately on landing. A disaster resulted, for the papers found upon\r\nhim were compromising, the plot was discovered, and wholesale arrests\r\nwere made in Petersburg in consequence.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three persons of both sexes were tried in secret, and, according\r\nto the _Novosti_, the evidence given against them by Princess Kochkaryòv\r\ncaused life sentences to be passed upon each of them.\r\n\r\nFrom facts that came to our knowledge, it was evident that some one who\r\nhad learned our secret had divulged it to the police, therefore the five\r\nmen forming the Nihilist Executive Committee—who must be known here as\r\nPaul Pétroff, Alexander Grinevitch, Nicolas Tersinski, Isaac Bounakoff,\r\nand Dmitri Irteneff—sat in council and condemned the Princess to death.\r\n\r\nWe cast dice, and it fell to me to carry out the sentence!\r\n\r\nThe cool, flippant manner in which my fellow-conspirators spoke of murder\r\nawed me. They noticed my scruples and pointed out that the woman had, by\r\ngiving false evidence, been instrumental in the deportation of more than\r\ntwenty innocent persons, therefore she must die. As I had taken an oath\r\nto carry out all commands of the Executive under penalty of death, I was\r\ncompelled to obey.\r\n\r\nI had not far to search for Madame the Princess, for she was residing\r\ntemporarily in London, having taken a furnished flat at Albert Hall\r\nMansions, overlooking Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nIn the stalls at the Avenue Theatre I first obtained an uninterrupted\r\nview of her. She was seated next to me, a fair form in a black evening\r\ndress that revealed her delicate chest and arms, with a gleaming diamond\r\nnecklet around her white throat. Her age was about twenty-four, and her\r\nperfect oval face had a shade of sadness upon it, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat languishing violet eyes, and the tender winning mouth, while her\r\nauburn hair had been deftly coiled, and was fastened with a diamond star\r\nthat flashed and sparkled with a thousand fires. In short, I thought her\r\nthe most lovely woman I had ever seen.\r\n\r\nAnd I was plotting to kill her!\r\n\r\nI gazed into her face, entranced by her marvellous beauty. Toying with\r\nher Watteau fan, she turned her eyes full upon me, and the faintest flush\r\nsuffused her cheek; then she made pretence of reading her programme, and\r\nafterwards became interested in the performance. When I went out to smoke\r\nduring the _entr’acte_ I passed her, and in doing so uttered an apology\r\nin Russian, to which she responded in the same language, with a kindly\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nAccording to information I had obtained, she was the wife of Prince\r\nKochkaryòv, a noble in the third degree, some twenty years her senior.\r\nTheir marriage had been fraught with much unhappiness, and after a year\r\nthey agreed to separate. Since that time the Prince had remained at\r\nhis gloomy old palace near Markovka, in Little Russia, while his wife,\r\naccompanied by an old man-servant and her maid, had resided for brief\r\nperiods in Petersburg, Paris, and London.\r\n\r\nSince her arrival in England it was apparent that she was fulfilling some\r\nmission as a Russian Government agent, yet the suspicion she excited in\r\nsome quarters in no way hindered her from obtaining social influence, and\r\nshe dispensed hospitality to a very select circle. She went everywhere,\r\nand her daily doings were chronicled in the personal columns of the\r\nnewspapers. I had been watching her for several days, and on this evening\r\nhad followed her to the theatre in order, if possible, to become\r\nacquainted with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain descended and we rose to leave I turned, and said to her\r\npolitely in Russian—\r\n\r\n“You are alone, Madame. Will you permit me to find your carriage?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, you are very kind,” she said in English, with a pretty\r\nhesitating accent. “My man has buff livery.”\r\n\r\n“And the name, Madame?”\r\n\r\n“The Princess Kochkaryòv,” she replied, adding, “We are compatriots, are\r\nwe not, m’sieur?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, smiling. “It is always pleasant to meet Russians in a\r\nforeign land,” at the same time handing her a card which gave my name as\r\nVladimir Mordvinoff and my address at a suite of furnished chambers I\r\nrented in Shaftesbury Avenue.\r\n\r\nA few moments later I handed her into her carriage, and as she thanked me\r\nand drove away, I walked, morose and thoughtful, up Northumberland Avenue\r\ntowards my rooms.\r\n\r\nDuring the week that followed we met several times. She showed herself in\r\nno way averse to my companionship, for she told me that she was always\r\nat home on Thursdays and would be pleased to see me. This invitation I\r\naccepted, and thus I became a frequent visitor.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon I had called and lingered. The guests had departed.\r\n\r\nIn the fading light of the summer’s evening I was sitting with her in\r\nher pretty drawing-room that overlooked the dusty trees. As she lolled\r\ngracefully against the window the last ray of sunlight fell upon her, and\r\nshe looked daintily bewitching.\r\n\r\nI admit that I loved her madly, passionately. Overwhelmed by the\r\ncontemplation of her beauty, enchanted by the magic of her voice, which\r\nmade the sweetest music out of the merest phrases, I thought of nought\r\nbut her, and was only happy when at her side. Yet when I remembered the\r\ndifference in our social position, and her marriage with the Prince, I\r\nwas almost beside myself with despair; I knew that mine was an adoration\r\nthat could only end in unhappiness.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily my hand touched my pocket and struck something hard. I drew\r\nit away in horror. What terrible irony of fate! The woman I loved dearer\r\nthan life was doomed to die by my hand!\r\n\r\nShe had been gazing dreamily out of the window, when suddenly with a\r\nmischievous smile she exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“You are very silent, m’sieur.”\r\n\r\nI scarcely know what prompted me, but, jumping up quickly, and grasping\r\nher tiny, bejewelled hand, I raised it to my lips and in English poured\r\nforth a declaration of my love.\r\n\r\nShe trembled. Her breath came and went in short, quick gasps, but she did\r\nnot attempt to arrest the flood of passionate words that escaped me. Ere\r\nI had concluded, my heart was filled with joy, for I saw my passion was\r\nreciprocated.\r\n\r\nVainly striving to overcome her emotion, she exclaimed excitedly—\r\n\r\n“I—I was unprepared—I did not think you loved me, Vladimir. Do you doubt\r\nI care for you? Have you not seen it? _Mon Dieu!_ my married life has\r\nbeen only a grim and dismal tragedy. I loved no man until I met you!”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think sometimes of me, Princess?” I asked, scarcely\r\nbelieving the truth.\r\n\r\n“To you I am Irene,” she said in pretty broken English. “All my life has\r\nbeen wasted hitherto. You have asked me; I have give you answer. I love\r\nonly you. Some day you will know me better. Now, you know me only for the\r\nmad passion I bear for you. But yourself shall make satisfy of my past,\r\nmy truth, my honour, and—and I shall get—what you call—divorce from the\r\nPrince, and we two will marry—eh? Of you I ask not one single question.\r\nYou are my lover, the only man for whom I have affection, and—and in\r\nreturn I am your serf.”\r\n\r\nShe buried her flushed face upon my shoulder and sobbed.\r\n\r\nTaking her in my arms, I swore to her everlasting constancy. All my heart\r\nwas in the declaration. In the glamour of that hour we were reckless and\r\negotistical as most lovers, heedless of the shadow that was growing up\r\nbehind the sunshine of our happy vows of undying affection. When she\r\ngrew calm, she looked up searchingly into my eyes and said: “You cannot\r\nunderstand me. You do not know the bitterness of my life.”\r\n\r\n“No, Irene. Tell me about yourself,” I said.\r\n\r\nHesitatingly she seated herself in a wicker chair, and motioned me to a\r\nseat at her side.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” I said, laughing. “At your feet, Princess; always at your\r\nfeet,” and, casting myself upon a low footstool, I took her hand in mine.\r\n\r\n“My life has been wasted,” she said mournfully. “My mother was French;\r\nmy father an Imperial Councillor of Russia. My earlier life was passed\r\nat Moscow, and afterwards at the Court at Petersburg. I was forced by\r\nmy father to marry the Prince, who, as you are well aware, is rich and\r\npowerful. But, _ma foi!_ from the first he treated me cruelly. Within six\r\nmonths of our marriage he commenced to ill-use me brutally; indeed, I\r\nbear upon my body the scars of his violence. The world was _débonnaire_\r\nwhile I was _triste_ and downcast, for I found he had a _liaison_ with a\r\nFrench _danseuse_. I bore his insults and blows until I was in fear of my\r\nlife; then I came here.”\r\n\r\n“How could he be so cruel?” I cried in indignation.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I have not told all, Vladimir,” she said with a sorrowful sigh.\r\n“The Prince plotted with his friend, Stepán Nekhlindoff, in order to\r\nobtain a divorce, but I thwarted their vile scheme. Nekhlindoff tried to\r\ncompromise me, but I repelled his advances, for although I have so far\r\nabandoned my marriage vow as to love you while I am still wedded, I have\r\ndone nothing by which my husband can obtain the freedom he seeks. Since I\r\nleft Markovka I have wandered about, to Paris, Vienna, Brussels, with no\r\nprotection against the dishonourable conspiracy. I grew tired of life—I—”\r\n\r\n“You have a friend in me,” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, my love,” she exclaimed, stroking my hair tenderly, and bending\r\nto kiss me. “Though I have been in the midst of luxury and gaiety, my\r\nlife has been very dark and dreary. But happiness has now returned.”\r\n\r\n“It gives me joy to hear you speak like this, Irene,” I said. “Nothing\r\nwill, I hope, occur to part us, or cause our love to be less stronger\r\nthan it is at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“What can?” she asked quickly, raising her eyebrows. “We trust one\r\nanother. I have money enough for both. What more?”\r\n\r\nThe horrible thought that the knife in my pocket must sooner or later be\r\nplunged into her heart flashed across my mind, causing me to shudder.\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied with a feigned, hollow laugh, “I—it is only a foolish\r\nfancy on my part. My joy seems almost too perfect to be lasting.”\r\n\r\n“I am yours; you are mine,” she said passionately. “We shall marry and\r\nlive together always as happy as we are to-day.”\r\n\r\nTwilight had faded, and it had grown almost dark. I had risen and was\r\nstanding beside her chair, bending and kissing her soft cheek, when\r\nsuddenly the door opened and the maid entered to light the lamps.\r\n\r\n“Pardon, Madame,” exclaimed the girl, starting back, “I thought you had\r\ngone out.”\r\n\r\n“No, Nina, I shall not go out to-night,” said her mistress. “Tell cook\r\nthat M’sieur Mordvinoff will remain and dine.”\r\n\r\nWhen the maid had lit the lamps and departed, I returned to where the\r\nPrincess sat, and noticed how her face had changed. Instead of the cold,\r\nhaughty expression usual to her, her flushed countenance beamed with\r\ntender, womanly love, an expression that was supremely fascinating. As I\r\nstood admiring her, a morbid fancy crept over me. Why should I not take\r\nher life now she was in the zenith of her happiness? It would be better\r\nso, I argued; better than allowing her passion to develop and overwhelm\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI was too well aware that the violation of my oath would mean death to\r\nme as well as to her, and as I stood behind her chair I placed my hand\r\nupon the hilt of the knife in my pocket and half drew it from its sheath.\r\nBut I could not bring myself to commit the crime. Drawing a long breath,\r\nI pushed the keen blade into its leather case with a firm determination\r\nto overcome my thoughts, and again seating myself upon the stool at her\r\nfeet, continued talking of our plans for the future.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later I was summoned before a council meeting of the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\n“We understand,” exclaimed Pétroff, the President of the Council, “that\r\nyou hesitate to carry out the sentence of death upon the Princess\r\nKochkaryòv. Why?”\r\n\r\nI glanced round at the pale, determined faces of the five desperate\r\nrevolutionists who were sitting at a table in the well-furnished\r\ndining-room in Oakleigh Gardens.\r\n\r\n“I—I want time,” I stammered.\r\n\r\n“Time! You have already had three months. We are well aware that you\r\nadmire her; but she must not escape. Remember the oath you took upon this\r\nknife,” and he pointed to a long bright dagger that lay unsheathed on the\r\ntable before him. “The Executive have decided that the traitress must\r\ndie. If she escapes, you will pay the penalty. We trust in you.”\r\n\r\nIn a frenzy of mad despair I walked the London streets one day a week\r\nlater, seeking some means by which to avert the death of the woman I\r\nloved. The decree of the Executive was irrevocable. Their terrible\r\nfar-reaching vengeance is known throughout the world, and it is their\r\nproud boast that of those whom they have condemned to death, not one has\r\never escaped.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering aimlessly for many hours, my footsteps led me\r\ninvoluntarily to Albert Hall Mansions.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening, somewhere about ten o’clock, when the old\r\nservant Ivan admitted me. As I entered the drawing-room she did not\r\nat first observe my presence, and I stood for a few moments watching\r\nher. She wore a dainty evening gown of cream relieved by amber ribbons,\r\nand was reclining in an armchair, reading a novel. The mellow light of\r\nthe shaded lamp fell upon her fair head pillowed on the satin cushion,\r\nand her whole attitude was one of peace and repose. Between her dainty\r\nfingers she held a cigarette.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my movement startled her.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Vladimir! _Quel plaisir!_” she cried, tossing aside her book and\r\nrising to bid me welcome. “All day I have expected you.”\r\n\r\nAfter kissing her upturned face I sank into a chair without a word.\r\n\r\n“What ails you?” she asked, starting up in alarm, noticing my pale\r\ncountenance and mud-bespattered clothes. “You—you are ill. Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing,” I assured her, striving to smile. “A slight faintness,\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n\r\nAccepting the explanation, she re-seated herself and we commenced to\r\nchat. Of what we said I have no recollection. I know that when she lifted\r\nmy hand to her lips I drew it away as if I had been stung. She was\r\ncaressing the hand that was so soon to take her life! The thought was\r\nhorrifying, and she was at a loss to understand the meaning of my action.\r\n\r\n“You are not well to-night, Vladimir,” she said half-reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Irene,” I replied, “I’m well enough in health. It is the\r\nknowledge of our love that troubles me.”\r\n\r\n“Of our love?”\r\n\r\nI cast her hand aside, and jumping to my feet, paced the room in\r\ndesperation. She clutched my arm, entreating me to tell her the cause of\r\nmy agitation. Suddenly I stopped before her.\r\n\r\n“Princess,” I whispered hoarsely, grasping her slim, white wrist, “hear\r\nme! I am base, ignoble: I have deceived you!”\r\n\r\n“What! You love me not—you——”\r\n\r\n“I love you better than life. I would do anything to save you, yet, by a\r\ndevilish conspiracy of circumstances I am compelled to kill you!”\r\n\r\n“Kill me!” she gasped in Russian. “God! You are an imbecile—mad!”\r\n\r\nHer face blanched; she tottered and almost fell.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was mad,” I said bitterly. “Mad to love you when I knew that I\r\nmust kill you. I am a Nihilist!”\r\n\r\n“A Nihilist!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. By your evidence some members of our Organisation have been sent to\r\nSiberia, and the sentence the Executive has passed upon you is death.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she cried wildly. “My God! It is the statement in the _Novosti_!\r\nListen, Vladimir!” Pausing to gain breath, she shuddered at the sight\r\nof the long knife that I had drawn and held in my hand. “It was a vile\r\nlie concocted by my husband in order that the Nihilist vengeance should\r\nfall upon me. When Stepán Nekhlindoff’s plot failed he resorted to\r\nthis scheme, and got some journalist he knew to insert the libellous\r\nstatement, well knowing that I should not escape death.”\r\n\r\n“Is the allegation untrue, then?” I asked, amazed.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I swear it is. At the time of the trial I was at Odessa with the\r\nArchduchess Paul, and was perfectly ignorant of everything until I saw\r\nthe paragraph. I wrote contradicting it, but they did not publish my\r\nletter. It was the Prince who desired that the Organisation should remove\r\nme and leave him free.”\r\n\r\n“I accept your explanation, Princess,” I said. “Yet how am I to save you?\r\nBy my oath I am bound to obey the mandate of our Circle and encompass\r\nyour death.”\r\n\r\n“I am innocent, Vladimir. Am I compelled to die?” she asked, glancing\r\napprehensively at the knife that flashed so ominously in the lamplight.\r\n“Can I not have time—time to prepare for death?”\r\n\r\n“How long?”\r\n\r\n“Three days, or more. I—I shall not try to escape. I swear.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I replied in a low voice. “It is agreed. Three days.” And\r\nbidding her a strained, sorrowful farewell, I left her.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock on the evening of the third day the door of the flat was\r\nflung open by Ivan in response to my summons.\r\n\r\n“Is the Princess at home?” I asked of the grave-faced old man.\r\n\r\n“Alas, m’sieur,” he replied in a grief-stricken voice, “Madame is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Dead!” I gasped. “When did she die?”\r\n\r\n“She—she has been murdered!” he exclaimed in an awed tone. “I discovered\r\nher body two hours ago. The doctor and police are now in her room.”\r\n\r\nI rushed along the hall to the apartment in which I heard low voices. It\r\nwas a large, well-furnished bedchamber dimly illuminated by two candles.\r\nUpon a couch near the window lay the body of the Princess wrapped in a\r\nwhite Cashmere shawl, the breast of which was only slightly stained with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHeedless of the doctor and two police inspectors who were conversing\r\ntogether, I went over to the body and gazed upon it.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw amazed me. I staggered, yet by presence of mind managed to\r\nconceal my agitation.\r\n\r\nThe fair, handsome face of the Princess had been slashed with the knife\r\nin the form of a cross, and the mutilation gave it a terribly ghastly\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nSomething bright in the hands of one of the police officers attracted my\r\nattention. He was examining it by the light of the candles as I peered\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was a dagger which, in an instant, I recognised as mine!\r\n\r\nI felt in my pocket. The sheath was there but the weapon had gone! I was\r\naghast in horror and amazement. I had been forestalled, and the Princess\r\nhad been murdered with the knife stolen from me!\r\n\r\nThe officer, after questioning me, took my assumed name and address,\r\nexplaining that I should be required at the inquest.\r\n\r\nIn reply to my inquiries, Ivan told me that the Princess, intending to\r\nleave for Paris on the morrow, had sent on Nina, her maid, in advance to\r\nsecure her rooms. At five o’clock, while in the dining-room, he heard the\r\nouter door slam, and concluded that his mistress had gone out. Two hours\r\nlater he entered the bedroom and discovered the crime.\r\n\r\nThe Executive sat on the following evening and I attended to make\r\nmy report. It was a mere formality, for the papers were full of the\r\nmysterious crime.\r\n\r\n“Princess Kochkaryòv is removed,” I said, briefly, when interrogated by\r\nPétroff.\r\n\r\n“Thanks to the assistance of Dmitri,” he added grimly.\r\n\r\n“Irteneff!” I repeated, glancing at the dark, middle-aged man indicated,\r\nwho sat with his elbows leaning upon the table.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the man said, laughing, “I knew how difficult it is to assassinate\r\nthe woman one loves, so I assisted you.”\r\n\r\nAt the inquest I identified the body, and Ivan related his brief story.\r\nTwice the inquiry was adjourned, and subsequently a verdict was returned\r\nthat the Princess had been murdered by “some person or persons unknown.”\r\nThe Prince was communicated with by telegraph, but he took no notice, and\r\nat the funeral Ivan and myself were the only mourners.\r\n\r\nThe police could discover no clue to the assassin, and thus another was\r\nadded to London’s long list of unfathomable mysteries.\r\n\r\nOne day, about six weeks after the funeral, I received a hurried note\r\nfrom Ivan, asking me to meet him at half-past seven that evening under\r\nthe railway bridge adjoining the Charing Cross Station of the Underground\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nThinking that he might have something of importance to tell me, I kept\r\nthe appointment. The road which runs under the bridge is not too well\r\nlit, and the spot is rather quiet about that hour.\r\n\r\nBig Ben had just boomed the half-hour, when I felt a slight pressure on\r\nmy arm, and heard my Christian name uttered.\r\n\r\nTurning quickly, I confronted a female figure enveloped in a travelling\r\ncloak, and wearing a soft felt hat and a veil through which the features\r\nwere recognisable in the lamplight.\r\n\r\nIt was the Princess Kochkaryòv!\r\n\r\n“Irene!” I cried, “is it really you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I am no apparition,” she replied, with a laugh. “But I must not be\r\nseen. Let us walk this way.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we were strolling under the trees on the Embankment.\r\n\r\n“It was quite simple,” she said, in reply to my eager questions. “I\r\nalways was a little inventative. You remember that on the night you told\r\nme of my doom you found me alone reading? Well, that night Nina was ill,\r\nand I had been attending her. I did not call a doctor, as I had no idea\r\nthat she suffered from a weak heart. She died, poor girl, shortly before\r\nfive o’clock on the afternoon you had promised to return. Then a thought\r\noccurred to me that, as her hair was the same colour as my own, I might\r\npass off her body as mine. I took Ivan into my confidence, telling him of\r\nthe attempt which would be made upon my life——”\r\n\r\n“You did not mention my name?” I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. After I had dressed the body in one of my own wraps, we\r\ncarried it to my room and placed it upon the couch. Nina was about my\r\nbuild, therefore I attired myself in her clothes, and taking the most\r\nvaluable of my jewels, left at once for Paris. Meanwhile Ivan remained.\r\nFrom what he has told me it appears that he watched and saw a middle-aged\r\nman enter the flat by means of a latch-key. After searching several rooms\r\nhe went into my bedroom. There the man saw a female form which he thought\r\nwas myself, and stabbed it to the heart. All this occurred within half an\r\nhour of Nina’s death.”\r\n\r\n“And it was the mutilation of the face that prevented me from discovering\r\nthat it was Nina,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Yet no crime has been committed, and I have escaped.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful!” I exclaimed, astounded at the curious combination of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n“The Prince thinks me dead; therefore I am a free woman,” she said,\r\nas we walked up Villiers Street. “I am no longer Princess, but Madame\r\nValakhina. I still love you, Vladimir, but I can see it is useless, for\r\nif we met often the Nihilists would discover how they have been tricked.\r\nI must therefore leave you. To-night I go to Brussels and afterwards to\r\nYvoir, on the Meuse, where I have taken a villa. Ivan is there already.\r\nWhen you can safely leave London, come to me.”\r\n\r\nWe had ascended the steps and entered the Charing Cross terminus. The\r\nhands of the great clock pointed to twenty-five minutes past eight.\r\n\r\n“See,” she added, “I must go to the carriage. The train leaves at\r\neight-thirty.”\r\n\r\nWe walked along the platform, and she entered an empty first-class\r\ncompartment, in which a porter had already arranged her wraps.\r\n\r\nWhen the man had taken his tip and departed, I said—\r\n\r\n“Farewell, Irene.” My heart was too full to say more.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Vladimir. Not farewell,” she sobbed, her large violet eyes wet\r\nwith tears. “_Au revoir._ We shall meet again—some day.”\r\n\r\nAnd, as the Continental train moved slowly out of the station, she kissed\r\nher tiny hand to me, again murmuring—\r\n\r\n“_Au revoir!_ I owe my life to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BURLESQUE OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secret Police attached to the Russian Embassy in London are\r\never-watchful and untiring in their efforts to discover the plans and\r\nmovements of our Party. It is, therefore, our constant endeavour to lead\r\nthem upon false scents and direct their attention to quarters in direct\r\nopposition to that in which we are working.\r\n\r\nNo monarch possesses such a prodigious organisation of police spies and\r\n_agents provocateurs_ as the Tzar. His emissaries are in every European\r\ncity, and it must be admitted that for cunning and astuteness they are\r\nunequalled. Attached to each Embassy is the _Okhrannoë Otdelenïe_,\r\nconsisting of some twenty or thirty detectives, whose duty it is to\r\nclosely watch political suspects and forward elaborate reports of their\r\nmovements to General Sekerzhinski, chief of the department at Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe stratagems practised by these agents and their insolence are\r\nunbounded. In smaller States, such as Bulgaria, Roumania, Switzerland,\r\nand Italy, both law and political decency are violated, and these men\r\nact as if they were in a Russian provincial town. No one in the Balkan\r\nPeninsular doubts that the two Bulgarians who attempted to assassinate\r\nMantoff, the Prefect of Rustchuk, when he was so imprudent as to go\r\nto Bucharest, were the tools of Yakobson, then third secretary of the\r\nRussian Embassy in Roumania. Again, it was proved that they offered\r\npeople bribes to clandestinely introduce implements for false coining\r\ninto the lodgings of a well-known literary man, the Russian refugee,\r\nCass-Dobrogeanu. In dozens of cases attempts have been made—often\r\nsuccessfully—to introduce bombs and explosives into the houses of Russian\r\nsuspects abroad in order that they may be accused and imprisoned, thus\r\nremoving their revolutionary influence. After a recent trial in Paris\r\nwhere six men were condemned to long terms of imprisonment for having\r\ndynamite in their possession, it was proved most conclusively that into\r\nthe houses of four of them the explosive had been introduced by persons\r\nbribed by a provocating agent of the Tzar’s Government!\r\n\r\nIt is also well known in our Circle that in the beginning of the last\r\ndecade Colonel Soudeikin, the then chief of spies and provocating agents\r\nin Petersburg, proposed to his principal confidential agent—afterwards\r\nhis murderer—Degayeff, in order to strengthen his reputation in\r\nrevolutionary circles, that he should murder an unimportant fellow-spy,\r\nP⸺, first exposing him to the revolutionists. “Of course,” remarked\r\nSoudeikin, “it is hard on him, but what can one do? You must gain their\r\nconfidence in some way, and in any case P⸺ will never be good for\r\nanything.” Indeed, the man referred to was already suspected of being a\r\nspy, and all the revolutionists were on their guard against him.\r\n\r\nAt such a level of morality the prospect of a “paying job” is sufficient\r\nto inspire the agents of the Russian “State police” with a spirit of\r\nboundless enterprise. The advantage thus gained by the Russian Government\r\nis enormous; provocation is the surest way to give false impressions\r\nabout the Russian patriots and to terrorise foreign public opinion to the\r\ndetriment of the liberation movement.\r\n\r\nRecently the foreign branch of the “higher police” has been strengthened\r\nand re-modelled. In London the section now works independently. Paris\r\nhas been constituted the centre from which operations in other towns\r\nare superintended; then come university towns, such as Montpellier,\r\nZurich, and Berne, and the towns specially frequented by Russians, as\r\nNice and Mentone. From Paris “flying brigades” of spies and provocators\r\nare sent out to places where “special activity” is required. The staff\r\nof employees in the French capital has within the past year been\r\n“renewed,” and their numbers greatly augmented. As an instance, no\r\nfewer than twelve new agents were sent from Russia immediately after the\r\nassassination of General Seliverstroff in Paris.\r\n\r\nMore attention is bestowed upon London than elsewhere, because it has\r\nbecome known that many of the foremost of the so-called Terrorists reside\r\nin the English metropolis. The satellites of the “Security Section,”\r\nhowever, baffled by the watchfulness of our own spies, are unable to make\r\nmuch progress with their inquiries owing to the traps we lay for them.\r\nIndeed, finding their activity counteracted, they have now founded in\r\nLondon a kind of Russian institution, which by its artistic and literary\r\nattractions induces Russians living in the metropolis to visit it; the\r\naim being to facilitate the obtaining of information and the choice of\r\nfuture victims for provocation. Members of the Party are, however, too\r\nwary to visit it.\r\n\r\nAt the time the events related in this chapter occurred, the Executive\r\nhad resolved upon decisive action.\r\n\r\nAs a protest against the increasing tyranny of the late Tzar Alexander,\r\nit had been decided that a grand _coup_ should be made at the Winter\r\nPalace at Petersburg, where two members of our Organisation were engaged\r\nas trusted servants in the Imperial household. News of the plot was\r\nconveyed secretly to the various Circles on the Continent, while we in\r\nLondon set about arranging the various details.\r\n\r\nTo Nicolas Tersinski, who lived in Heygate Street, Walworth, was the work\r\nof manufacturing a dynamite clock entrusted. He had been a locksmith in\r\nWarsaw and was skilled in mechanical contrivances. It was he who made the\r\nbombs which wrecked the Imperial train near Grodno, and the machines that\r\nhad caused several other “outrages” were due to his ingenuity.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were in progress, it was of course highly\r\nessential that our secret should be strictly guarded and that our\r\nubiquitous enemies, the police spies, should entertain no suspicion of\r\nour intentions. Nevertheless, we were one day amazed and startled to\r\ndiscover that the “Security Section” had suddenly grown more active than\r\nusual, and that there were unmistakable signs that they had gained some\r\nknowledge of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe Executive held a hurried meeting to consider the best means of\r\naverting their espionage. I was still living expensively as a young man\r\nabout town, and as I rarely visited the house in Oakleigh Gardens, my\r\nconnection with the revolutionists was unknown to the police. For this\r\nreason I was chosen, together with Grinevitch, to assist in the work\r\nof “shadowing” the spies in order that Pétroff and the committee might\r\ncomplete their plans and get the machine safely to Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe work was exciting and somewhat risky; but it suited my adventurous\r\nspirit. The daring with which our Organisation acted inspired me with\r\nconfidence, and I went fearlessly about attired in various garbs,\r\ntracking the minions of the Tzar into all sorts of queer corners of\r\nLondon. They were indefatigable; but, owing to our headquarters being\r\ntemporarily abandoned, they were entirely off the scent. It was my object\r\nto further puzzle them, and, assisted by half a dozen other members of\r\nthe Party, I think I succeeded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the clock was being completed and the plans for the _coup_\r\nelaborated.\r\n\r\nWhile sitting one evening at a small table in the Café Royal in Regent\r\nStreet, smoking, sipping kummel, and lazily scanning the _Petit Journal_,\r\na word in guttural Russian addressed to the waiter caused me to glance\r\nacross to a tall dark man in evening dress, who had seated himself\r\nalone and unnoticed at the other side of the table opposite me. A\r\nmomentary glance was sufficient for me to recognise in him the original\r\nof a photograph that had been given me and pointed out as Guibaud, the\r\nrenowned French detective, who had recently been placed at the head of\r\nthe “Security Section” in London.\r\n\r\nHe was lighting his cigar and flashing a fine diamond upon his finger,\r\nwhen I suddenly asked him for the lighted match for my cigarette. By that\r\nmeans I opened a commonplace conversation, and I quickly felt confident\r\nthat he had no suspicion that I was a Terrorist. After spending nearly\r\nan hour together, and drinking at each other’s expense, we strolled to\r\nOxford Circus, where we parted, not, however, before we had exchanged\r\ncards, he giving me one with the name “Jules Guibaud,” while upon mine\r\nwas inscribed the words “Pierre Noirel—National Liberal Club.” He told\r\nme that he was a glove merchant in the Rue de la Paix, while I made him\r\nbelieve that I was a young Belgian of independent means living in England\r\nfor the purpose of acquiring the language.\r\n\r\nOn leaving him, I jumped into an omnibus going in the direction of the\r\nMarble Arch; but as soon as the conveyance had travelled about five\r\nhundred yards, I alighted and followed the astute chief spy, who was then\r\nretracing his steps down Regent Street. Eventually I discovered that he\r\nresided in Russell Square, Bloomsbury, and from that evening I haunted\r\nhim like a shadow, in order to obtain an insight into his methods. I\r\nquickly ascertained how closely day and night the prominent members of\r\nour Circle were being watched, not only by the Russian police, but by\r\ndetectives from Scotland Yard, whose aid they had invoked. Guibaud and I\r\nmet on several occasions, and always as friends.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon when I called at the house of Isaac Bounakoff in Aspland\r\nGrove, Hackney, to which our headquarters had been temporarily\r\ntransferred, Pétroff made a statement that caused me considerable\r\namazement and dismay. Notwithstanding our precautions, the spies had\r\ndiscovered Tersinski’s house in Walworth, and were watching it. Isaac\r\nhad recognised one of the “Security Section” men standing at the corner\r\nof the street. He had completed the machine, and was anxious to remove it\r\nto a place of safety before search was made by the English police. It was\r\nimperative that the incriminating object should be got out of the house\r\nwithout delay, and after some discussion the task of removing it devolved\r\nupon me, Grinevitch volunteering to assist.\r\n\r\nReturning at once to my chambers, I contrived, by the aid of a grey wig\r\nand the contents of my “make-up” box, to assume the appearance of an\r\nelderly man. Attiring myself in a seedy suit, I donned an apron, which\r\nI rolled up around my waist, so that when, an hour later, I alighted\r\nfrom an omnibus in the Walworth Road, I presented the appearance of a\r\nrespectable mechanic. It was now quite dark, and as I turned down the\r\nquiet street I met an ill-clad man sauntering up and down, smoking a\r\nshort, clay pipe. The light of a street lamp fell upon features which I\r\nrecognised as those of Guibaud! He gave me a sharp, inquiring glance, but\r\nwas unsuspicious; therefore I walked on until I came before Tersinski’s\r\nhouse—an eight-roomed dwelling, with area and basement of the usual South\r\nLondon type. Then I looked round suddenly, and seeing the spy’s back\r\nturned, darted up the steps leading to the front door, and swiftly let\r\nmyself in with the latch-key.\r\n\r\nThe unfamiliar interior was pitch dark, and I was afraid to strike a\r\nmatch lest the detective’s attention might be attracted. Groping my way\r\ncarefully up the stairs, I ascended to Tersinski’s workshop on the top\r\nfloor, where he had told me I should find the box.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments’ search I found it standing under a bench near the\r\nwindow. Handling it with the utmost care—for it was already charged with\r\na sufficient quantity of dynamite to wreck the whole street—I drew it\r\nforth and found it had the appearance of a small, black, tin deed box,\r\nwith handles at each end, while upon the side the name “F. Evans, Esq.,”\r\nhad been painted in white capitals.\r\n\r\nI was just bending to lift it from the ground, when I was startled at\r\nfeeling myself seized from behind.\r\n\r\n“Ah! You are my prisoner!” cried a voice, which, in a moment, I\r\nrecognised as that of Guibaud, who had evidently followed me into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAt first both my arms seemed pinioned, but not for long. In a few seconds\r\nI had recovered my breath, wrested my right arm free, and drawn my\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\nIt flashed across my mind that we were alone, and that it was imperative\r\nI should overpower him.\r\n\r\n“Let me go, curse you!” I cried in French. “I give you warning that if\r\nyou don’t I’ll fire into that box and blow you to the devil!”\r\n\r\n“Do it,” he replied. “You would die too. I arrest you for the manufacture\r\nof explosives.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t make too sure of your prey,” I said, at the same time taking him\r\noff his guard, and freeing myself by dint of a great effort.\r\n\r\nIn the dim uncertain light, I saw something lying upon the bench, and\r\nsnatched it up. It was a hammer.\r\n\r\n“_Sacré_,” hissed Guibaud, “you shall not escape now I have caught you in\r\nthe act,” and his dark form darted forward.\r\n\r\nI was only just in time. Raising the hammer, I brought it down with a\r\ncrushing blow upon his skull.\r\n\r\nUttering a loud cry of pain, he reeled backwards and fell.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment’s hesitation I cast the hammer aside, thrust the\r\nrevolver into my pocket, and grasping the box, dashed downstairs to the\r\nstreet door.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I heard a man passing outside, whistling a music-hall air.\r\nIt was Grinevitch; I knew that no one was watching outside. Opening the\r\ndoor, I carried the box down the steps and hurried quickly away in the\r\nopposite direction to that by which I had approached. Walking down Deacon\r\nStreet, in order to return to the Walworth Road, I was surprised to find\r\nso many police constables, for fully a dozen passed me. Nevertheless, I\r\nwas unmolested, and on gaining the main thoroughfare hailed a passing\r\nhansom, and placing the box on the seat beside me, drove to my chambers.\r\n\r\nI had not been joined by Grinevitch as I had arranged, and supposed that\r\nhe had remained behind to ascertain the cause of the sudden arrival of\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nIt was well that I left the house as quickly as I did, for I afterwards\r\nlearnt that a raid was made upon the place almost immediately. But beyond\r\nfinding three rooms full of furniture, some locksmith’s tools, and the\r\nchief spy lying insensible, their vigilance was unrewarded.\r\n\r\nA week later Guibaud had recovered from the blow I had dealt him, and\r\nI was again “shadowing” him. He was walking along the Strand, in the\r\ndirection of Trafalgar Square, when I passed him and appeared to suddenly\r\nrecognise him. After a few minutes’ conversation I found he was going\r\ninto Oxford Street, therefore I proposed that he should accompany me\r\nalong Shaftesbury Avenue, and call at my chambers for a whisky and soda,\r\nan arrangement to which he made no objection.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he sat before my sitting-room fire admiring the artistic\r\ndecorations of my little flat, while I stood upon the hearthrug smoking\r\na cigarette, watching him with anxious expectation. He was foolishly\r\nunsuspicious, or he would not have drunk the liquor I offered him.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after emptying his glass he became dazed.\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t know how it is—but—I feel strangely unwell,” he exclaimed,\r\nwith an attempt to laugh, at the same time drawing his hand across his\r\nbrow. “_Dieu!_—my head is swimming—I—I——”\r\n\r\nAnd after struggling to rise, he fell back in the armchair unconscious.\r\n\r\nUnbuttoning his coat, I quickly abstracted the contents of his pockets.\r\n\r\nThere were only several letters and a well-worn pocket-book. Carefully\r\nexamining the entries in the latter, I found they consisted of the\r\nnames, addresses, and descriptions of various Russian refugees. Some of\r\nthe names had a cross against them, evidently denoting that they were\r\nrevolutionists. In the cover of the book was a letter on thin foreign\r\npaper, which had been carefully preserved. Eagerly reading through the\r\ncommunication, I discovered that the writer had betrayed our secret, and\r\ngave a detailed outline of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIt was written in Russian by a person who gave his address at 88, Rue\r\nRoyale, Dieppe, and signed with the initials “P. P.” But the caligraphy\r\nwas unmistakable, for I had had a number of communications in that\r\nhandwriting, which I recognised as that of Antìp Patrovski, a prominent\r\nmember of the Paris Circle. A number of members of that branch of the\r\nOrganisation had recently been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment,\r\nand now, from the letter I had discovered, it was clear that this\r\ntraitor to our Cause was in the pay of the Secret Police. Taking a\r\npencil and paper, I scribbled out a copy of the evidence of Patrovski’s\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nIt was his death-warrant!\r\n\r\nAfter I had made myself acquainted with the contents of the other\r\nletters, I replaced them all in the pockets of the insensible man, and\r\nthen endeavoured to restore him to consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he opened his eyes and roused himself, I treated the matter\r\njocularly, attributing the result to the strength of the whisky combined\r\nwith the heat of the room. Almost the first thing he did was to feel\r\nin his breast pocket. Finding both pocket-book and letters safe, his\r\nsuspicions were apparently allayed, and after drinking a little brandy he\r\npulled himself together and took a cab home.\r\n\r\nLittle did he dream that within half a dozen yards of where he had been\r\nseated was the dynamite clock which I had taken from under his very\r\nnose, and for which the police of London, Paris, and Berlin were busily\r\nsearching.\r\n\r\nNext day I reported Patrovski’s treachery to the Executive, and sentence\r\nwas passed.\r\n\r\nA week later news was received from Petersburg that all arrangements\r\nthere had been perfected. An emissary from the Russian capital was to\r\ntravel to Brussels and there receive the clock from the Executive. Every\r\nport of departure for the Continent was, however, being carefully\r\nwatched by the police, and passengers by the various mail trains were\r\nclosely scrutinised at the London termini. Even had they not been\r\nwatched, the ordinary routes would have been useless, for the Customs\r\nexamination at any foreign port would have been fatal to our project. The\r\nexact size of the box had been sent to Petersburg, and arrangements had\r\nbeen made for smuggling it across the German and Russian frontiers.\r\n\r\nAt length, after much discussion, the Executive resolved that as the box\r\nwas in my possession, I should undertake the handing of it over to the\r\nrepresentative from Russia.\r\n\r\nOwing to the spies at London stations, I was compelled to leave the\r\nbeaten track. On the day following the final decision, I placed the box\r\nin a small portmanteau, together with some wearing apparel, and, calling\r\na cab, drove to Croydon, thence taking train to the quaint old town of\r\nDeal. As there is no service of boats to the Continent from the sleepy\r\nlittle place, I felt secure, and took up my quarters at the “Ship,” an\r\nold-fashioned inn opposite the beach, frequented mainly by fishermen.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon following my arrival, I was seated in the dingy little\r\nbar-parlour scanning a limp, beer-stained newspaper three days old, when\r\nan elderly toiler of the sea entered.\r\n\r\n“Arf’noon, sir. Fresh breeze outside,” was his greeting in a deep, hoarse\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nI acquiesced, and as he seated himself in the window-bench and ordered\r\nhis rum of the ruddy-faced waiting-maid, I commenced to chat. From his\r\nconversation I learnt that he was the owner of a small smack, and that he\r\nand his three companions were going to “have a turn around the Goodwins\r\nat midnight.” When, with a landsman’s ignorance, I asked whether the\r\nfishermen of those parts were on good terms with the coastguard, he\r\nwinked knowingly and remarked—\r\n\r\n“There’s a good deal wot comes ashore here as don’t pay duty, you bet.”\r\n\r\nThis remark gave me confidence in my man.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” I said in a low tone, after we had been discussing the\r\nvarious modes of evading the Customs dues. “The fact is, I’ve got\r\nsomething that I don’t want to pay duty upon. How much do you want to run\r\nme over to Belgium to-night—eh?”\r\n\r\nThe man looked keenly at me, and his features relaxed into a curious\r\nsmile. Removing the long clay pipe from his lips, he gazed thoughtfully\r\ninto his glass.\r\n\r\n“Where do you want to land?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Anywhere that’s safe. My bag contains jewels—their description is in the\r\nhands of the police—you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Stolen,” he muttered, nodding his head. “I’ve done the same thing afore\r\nfor gents,” and he took a deliberate pull at his pipe. “Wenduyne ’ud\r\nbe the best place to run into. Nobody about; and you could take the\r\ndilly-gance to Blankenberghe and then go by train direct to Brussels.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; how much?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty poun’.”\r\n\r\nI tried to convince him that the sum asked was too much, but he argued\r\nthat it was “a contraband job,” and that there were three of his mates to\r\nbe paid out of it.\r\n\r\nAt last I consented.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said, “we’ll start at seven and land you afore daybreak.”\r\n\r\nThe evening was dark and stormy, but at the hour appointed I managed to\r\nget the portmanteau out of the inn unobserved, and met him on the beach.\r\nQuickly assuming the oilskin and sou’-wester he handed me, I jumped into\r\na small boat with the four men—about as rough-looking a quartette as one\r\ncould imagine—and a quarter of an hour later we boarded the smack that\r\nlay at anchor some distance from the shore.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in preparing to start, and soon hoisted sail, let go our\r\nmoorings, and set our bows around the Goodwins in the direction of the\r\nBelgian coast. Gradually the weather grew more boisterous, and our boat\r\nlaboured heavily through the rolling seas until midnight, when the storm\r\nabated.\r\n\r\nThe men were on deck managing the craft, while I, with the portmanteau\r\nunder the bench near me, sat alone in the corner of the narrow, dirty\r\nlittle cabin, smoking and reading a newspaper by the uncertain light of a\r\nswinging oil lamp. The motion of the boat must, I think, have lulled me\r\nto sleep, for I was suddenly awakened by hearing whispering near me.\r\n\r\nThe lamp had gone out and I was in total darkness.\r\n\r\nI listened, feeling convinced that I had heard subdued voices.\r\n\r\nSuddenly hoarse, ominous words broke upon my ear.\r\n\r\n“Garn. Don’t be a fool, Ned. He’s got jewels in the bag wot he’s stole.\r\nThere ain’t no reason why we shouldn’t share.”\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of the skipper.\r\n\r\n“Hush! You’ll wake him,” exclaimed another voice.\r\n\r\n“If he stirs, darn him, we’ll chuck him overboard, like we did the other\r\ncove, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nI sat breathless, hesitating to move. It was plain that the men were a\r\ngang of unscrupulous villains who intended to rob me.\r\n\r\nWhile I was reflecting upon my position, I heard the portmanteau being\r\ndragged from under the seat where I had placed it. I knew I must act.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you want with my bag, pray?” I cried, jumping to my feet.\r\n\r\n“Lie still, won’t you,” replied the skipper’s gruff voice; “we’re going\r\nto have our pick o’ the stones, and if you utter a word we’ll put you\r\nover where you can’t walk home.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed,” I shouted, drawing my revolver and standing erect and\r\nresolute. “Although I can’t see you, you devils, the first one who\r\ntouches my bag is a dead man.”\r\n\r\nA blow was immediately aimed at me, but fortunately it fell upon my left\r\narm. At that moment one of the men struck a light, and I found that all\r\nfour were in the little cabin with me.\r\n\r\nThe skipper, who had a life-preserver in his hand, noticed my revolver\r\nand hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Twenty poun’ ain’t enough,” he said fiercely, “so me and my mates mean\r\nto have some of your jewellery.”\r\n\r\nAs these words fell from his lips, one of the men, a tall, burly fellow,\r\nin a dirty yellow oilskin, grasped the handle of the portmanteau as if to\r\ncarry it upon deck.\r\n\r\n“We want no jaw,” exclaimed the skipper. “Say a word, and we’ll drown you\r\nlike a rat.”\r\n\r\n“Put that down,” I shouted to the man. “If you don’t, I’ll fire.”\r\n\r\nBut he laughed mockingly.\r\n\r\nPointing the pistol over his head, I pulled the trigger. The bullet\r\nwhizzed past his ear, and smashed the little square mirror that was\r\nhanging up behind where he was standing. The man dropped the bag, and\r\ndrawing a knife, was in the act of rushing upon me, but one of his\r\ncompanions held him back.\r\n\r\n“No,” cried the fellow who had grasped his arm. “Give him one more\r\nchance of life. If he hands over the bag to us, we’ll guarantee to land\r\nhim at Wenduyne.”\r\n\r\n“I sha’n’t give it up,” I replied in anger. “In the first place, you\r\ncowardly brutes have been caught in your own trap. There are no jewels\r\ninside, but stuff that you’d rather not have on board this craft. All\r\nthat’s inside is dynamite!”\r\n\r\n“Dynamite!” ejaculated the men, in alarm.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied. “Now, listen! You mistook your man. I’m not an\r\nabsconding thief, as you thought; but, nevertheless, I mean that you\r\nshall take me to Wenduyne, and what’s more, land me there before sunrise.\r\nIf you don’t, my mission will be useless. I’m tired of life, and if you\r\nfail to fulfil your contract, I shall touch the spring inside, and it\r\nwill send us all to kingdom come. Now, you infernal cut-throats, do as\r\nyou please. I shall remain here, and if you value your lives, you’ll\r\ncarry out the agreement for which I’ve paid you.”\r\n\r\nThen I unlocked the portmanteau, and showed them the box concealed inside.\r\n\r\nMy fierce, determined attitude cowed them. Like beaten dogs, they\r\nreturned on deck without scarcely uttering a word.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that I had such a quantity of explosive had its effect,\r\nfor, just as dawn was spreading, I was put ashore in a small boat upon\r\na lonely part of the beach, about three miles north of Wenduyne, and\r\ndirected to the road down which the diligence to Blankenberghe would\r\npass.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I took my seat in the mail train for the Belgian capital.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner hour on the same day I had taken my place at the _table\r\nd’hôte_ at the Hôtel de l’Europe at Brussels, when a tall, handsome\r\nwoman entered, and bowing stiffly, took a vacant chair opposite me.\r\nShe was about thirty-five, and dressed with taste and elegance. Her\r\ndark, piercing eyes looked into mine inquiringly for a moment, while I\r\ngazed steadily at her. Then, to my surprise, she gave the sign of our\r\nOrganisation. Immediately I gave the countersign, and glanced at her\r\nreassuringly.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal we carried on a commonplace conversation in French, and\r\nwhen it had ended we rose to separate. As we were passing out of the\r\n_salle à manger_, she whispered to me in Russian—\r\n\r\n“My room is number 64. Meet me there in half an hour.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and entered her private sitting-room unobserved. From the\r\nbreast of her dress she drew forth her credential, a letter signed by the\r\nchief of the Petersburg Circle. As my room was in the same corridor, I\r\nexperienced no difficulty in secretly conveying the box from my apartment\r\nto hers, and opening her dressing-case, she placed the clock in the side\r\nwhich had been specially constructed to receive it.\r\n\r\nWe sat talking for some time, she telling me of the progress of the\r\npropaganda in the Venice of the North, and explaining how, on the\r\noccasion of the festival of the Knights of St. George at the Winter\r\nPalace, the _coup_ was to be made.\r\n\r\n“I have been here four days,” she said, in reply to a question. “Early\r\nto-morrow morning I must leave on the return journey. I have now only\r\nfive days, for it is imperative I should be back in time.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, rising to take my leave, “the Executive send you\r\ngreeting, Madame, and wish you _bon voyage_. May this forthcoming blow to\r\nAutocracy prove decisive.”\r\n\r\n“_Merci, m’sieur_,” she replied. “I am utterly devoted to the Cause.” And\r\nwe grasped hands.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when I went down to breakfast, I learned that Madame had\r\nalready left—for Ostend they believed. After eating my meal I returned\r\nto my room, and was astonished to observe a well-dressed man emerging. A\r\nmoment later I met Guibaud face to face.\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear fellow,” he exclaimed, “they told me you were not up, so I\r\ncame to make an early call. Well, what are you doing over here? A little\r\nlove affair, eh?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’ve just run over to see a couple of old chums. I was at college\r\nhere, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, of course,” he said thoughtfully. “I remember, you told me. Well,\r\nI’m going down to get something to eat. Come into the _salle à manger_\r\npresently, will you? We’ll spend the day together.”\r\n\r\nI replied in the affirmative, and left him.\r\n\r\nEntering my room, I at once discovered that my portmanteau had been\r\nopened, and its contents turned over.\r\n\r\nBut the vigilance of the great detective had been frustrated, for he had\r\narrived a couple of hours too late.\r\n\r\nAt evening, six days later, I was walking down Pall Mall when a newsboy\r\nheld a paper under my nose suddenly, crying, “’Ere y’are, sir. Extra\r\nspe-shall! Attempt to murder the Tzar! Spe-shall!”\r\n\r\nI purchased a copy, and read the brief telegram regarding the explosion\r\nat the Imperial Palace. The Salle Blanche, and the adjoining State\r\napartments, had been wrecked, and although no lives had been lost,\r\nseveral persons had been injured. We regarded the plot as successful,\r\nfor once more, without the sacrifice of human life, we had terrified\r\nhis Imperial Majesty, and showed him that, notwithstanding his rigorous\r\nmeasures, Nihilism was still active.\r\n\r\nIn the same journal, under the heading, “A Paris Mystery,” was the report\r\nof the discovery of a body in the Seine, and from the description I knew\r\nit was that of the traitor Patrovski.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSOPHIE ZAGAROVNA’S SECRET.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the kerb in the Strand, opposite the entrance to the Gaiety Theatre, I\r\nwas, one wet winter’s night, selling newspapers.\r\n\r\nIll-clad and unwashed, I lounged about with the cab touts who were\r\nwaiting for the conclusion of the performance, and although for the past\r\nhour I had shouted the contents of the papers under my arm, I had only\r\nsold three copies. The dirty ragged rabble from the slums off Drury Lane\r\neyed me with askance as a new hand, little suspecting that I was acting\r\nthe part of detective.\r\n\r\nI was engaged in watching one of my compatriots who had recently arrived\r\nin England, and whom the Party regarded with suspicion. Ostensibly he was\r\nthe agent of a firm of merchants in Moscow, but from secret information\r\nwe had received from the Circle in that city, we shrewdly suspected that\r\nhis real mission was that of agent of Secret Police. Owing to his failure\r\nto discover the authors of the plot at the Winter Palace, Guibaud had\r\nbeen summarily dismissed from the service, and we believed that this\r\nman who called himself Albert Jacolliot was his successor. The vigilant\r\nobservation which for the past fortnight I had kept upon him went to show\r\nconclusively that he was in London on some secret errand.\r\n\r\nAssuming all sorts of disguises, I had watched him continuously since the\r\nfirst hour we had received warning that he was near us, and under the\r\npretence of selling newspapers, I was now awaiting his reappearance so\r\nthat I might follow him.\r\n\r\nWhilst standing on the kerb, wet and uncomfortable, gazing wistfully into\r\nthe warm, brilliantly-lit vestibule, a tall, beautiful girl descended the\r\nbroad flight of stairs. She was in evening dress, with a pink opera-cloak\r\naround her shoulders, and a black lace shawl over her head. Slight and\r\ndelicate, she had large brown lustrous eyes, wavy hair, a firm mouth, and\r\na nose that was just tip-tilted enough to give the face an expression of\r\npiquancy.\r\n\r\nSeveral touts rushed up to her, crying, “Keb or kerrige, lady?” But she\r\ntook no heed. Standing at the entrance for a moment she looked anxiously\r\nup and down, and then espied me.\r\n\r\nDrawing her cloak closer around her, she walked across to where I stood.\r\n\r\n“Paper, lady?” I asked. “_Globe_, _Echo_, _Star_?”\r\n\r\n“Give me anything you like, Anton Prèhznev,” she replied in Russian,\r\nat the same time uttering a pass-word that is known to the Russian\r\nRevolutionary Party throughout the world.\r\n\r\nI stood for a moment amazed. Noticing my surprise, she exclaimed in a low\r\ntone, “Give me a paper.”\r\n\r\nI gave her one, and in return she handed me a penny and a piece of paper\r\nfolded small.\r\n\r\n“An order from the Executive—conceal it,” she said, and turning quickly,\r\nentered a hansom that was standing near and drove away.\r\n\r\nPresently, when no one was watching, I walked up Catherine Street and\r\nopened the note under a street lamp.\r\n\r\nThe contents were brief, but to the point.\r\n\r\n“The bearer is Sophie Zagarovna. Call upon her at 11 a.m. to-morrow at\r\n76, The Terrace, Richmond, and render all assistance possible.—PAUL\r\nPÉTROFF.”\r\n\r\nSophie Zagarovna! I knew her by reputation and had been anxious to\r\nmeet her, for she was one of the most daring of the Zurich Nihilists.\r\nThe boldness and success of her plots had more than once caused them\r\nto be a source of comment throughout the world. It was she who, alone\r\nand unaided, entrapped General Yagodkin, Chief of the Moscow Police,\r\nand shot him dead because of the wholesale arrests of innocent persons\r\nwhich he made after the attempt to wreck the Winter Palace. For the past\r\nthree years she had lived in Zurich, where she had been the idol of the\r\nstudents. Young, refined, and eminently beautiful, she was queen of that\r\ncentre of learning, and the Russians and Germans studying at the colleges\r\nvied with one another to secure her smiles. She knew well the advantages\r\nof beauty, and influenced her young admirers to join the Party,\r\nafterwards prevailing upon them to go to Russia and perform various risky\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\nIn more than one instance a young man, madly in love with her and\r\nenthusiastic in the cause of freedom, had journeyed to the land of his\r\nbirth determined to strike a blow against Tzardom in order to secure her\r\nfavour, yet, alas! the result has been fatal—either death, or the mines.\r\nVain, and fond of admiration, she had numbers worshipping at her shrine,\r\nyet through all the breath of scandal had never touched her. Indeed, so\r\nintensely bent was she upon her purpose, that her heart appeared steeled\r\nagainst love, and she treated those who paid her court with queenly\r\nreserve. Of her parentage or real name nothing was known except that she\r\ntook the oath in Petersburg and afterwards went to Switzerland, where she\r\nspeedily developed into one of the most fearless of Terrorists.\r\n\r\nI returned to the theatre-entrance after reading the order from Pétroff.\r\nI saw my man emerge, and followed him to the Westminster Palace Hotel,\r\nwhere he was staying.\r\n\r\nPunctually at the time appointed, I was ushered into a pretty\r\nsitting-room at Richmond, the windows of which commanded a broad view of\r\nthe Terrace Gardens and the picturesque valley of the Thames. In a few\r\nmoments Sophie Zagarovna entered, and greeting me with a winning smile\r\nand pleasant words, sat down and commenced to chat.\r\n\r\n“I am here, in England, upon a secret mission from our Circle,” she said\r\nin Russian, replying to my inquiries. “The Executive have recommended you\r\nas one who can assist me. It is for our Cause, but its true object must\r\nnot be known just yet. You must understand that it is not because you are\r\ndistrusted, but because there are spies in the very walls. Will you help\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“For the Cause—yes,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Then listen. For the future I shall be known as Sophie Kalatenka,\r\ndaughter of the late General Kalatenka, Governor of Smolensk, and you are\r\nmy brother Ivan. We shall both change our residence and live at a West\r\nEnd boarding-house, where the other boarders will know us as brother and\r\nsister.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“You wonder why?” she added, arching her brows and laughing. “Well, you\r\nwill see. No one knows you at the Embassy, do they?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then leave all to me, and we shall succeed.”\r\n\r\nI remained and lunched with her, spending a very pleasant couple of hours\r\ndiscussing the prospects of the revolutionary programme, and criticising\r\nits weak points. Then I took leave of her, promising to meet her in\r\nLondon on the morrow.\r\n\r\nTwo months later we were one night guests at a grand ball given at the\r\nRussian Embassy, Chesham House.\r\n\r\nI had assumed the character of the handsome girl’s brother, and we had\r\ntaken up our quarters at an expensive boarding-house at South Kensington.\r\nBy means unknown to me Sophie had procured invitations for us both, and\r\nit was about ten o’clock when we alighted from our hired carriage, and\r\nshortly afterwards entered the fine ball-room. The uniforms of the men\r\nadded brilliancy to the gay scene, but among the women there was not one\r\nso beautiful as my “sister,” who, attired in a dress of pale heliotrope,\r\nlooked fresh and fair as a spring flower.\r\n\r\nSoon we were parted, and for the first hour I only caught occasional\r\nglimpses of her as she waltzed with various partners. Her flushed face\r\nbetokened pleasure, and she laughed merrily at me over her partner’s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, when I grew tired of dancing, I sought the quietude\r\nof the conservatory, which led out from an adjoining room. Casting myself\r\nupon a seat behind a great palm, where I was completely hidden from view,\r\nI gave myself up to reflection, vaguely wondering what was the nature of\r\nSophie’s secret mission.\r\n\r\nOnce, when she had been left alone for a moment during an interval, I sat\r\nbeside her, and asked how she was enjoying herself.\r\n\r\n“Very much,” she replied in a low whisper behind her fan. “If a tragedy\r\noccurs to-night, you need not be surprised.”\r\n\r\nThis warning puzzled me.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, words broke on my ear. I was not alone, as I had imagined. As I\r\nlistened I heard a man’s short, derisive laugh as he replied to an eager\r\nquestion put by a woman.\r\n\r\nI recognised the tones of the latter as those of Sophie.\r\n\r\n“Then you are not afraid of these murderous Nihilists?” she was asking.\r\n“Are they not dreadful people?”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” he replied confidently. “We are fully able to cope with such scum.\r\nSiberia is large enough to hold them all, and before long we shall stamp\r\nout the spirit of revolt from among the scoundrels. I myself have sent\r\ndozens of Nihilists to the mines, and for that reason my life has been\r\nthreatened.”\r\n\r\n“And you are not afraid of their vengeance?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“Scarcely,” he replied, laughing. “The cowardly idiots dare not touch me.”\r\n\r\n“But they are fearless,” she observed. “Their emissaries are everywhere.\r\nThey might kill you!”\r\n\r\n“They are perfectly at liberty to do their worst,” he replied grimly.\r\n“But why talk of such a subject, when all here are so gay? You look\r\ncharming!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks for the compliment,” she said. “But to hear about Nihilists\r\nalways interests me. I suppose you sometimes discover plots, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very often,” he answered. “Indeed, I am causing investigations to\r\nbe made now, at Moscow, and have obtained information which implicates\r\nbetween thirty and forty persons. I shall be returning to Russia in about\r\na fortnight, and as the life of the Tzar must be protected, I shall\r\ngive orders for the arrest and transportation of the whole batch of\r\nconspirators. But surely one so happy as yourself ought not to trouble\r\nyour head about such things,” he added, laughing.\r\n\r\nThen I heard him utter words of love, and the sound of a kiss fell upon\r\nmy ear.\r\n\r\nPresently, when he had declared his affection, and she had admitted in\r\nfaltering tones that she loved him, they rose and passed out into the\r\nball-room. I followed them unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe man upon whose arm she leaned, radiant and content, was Captain\r\nFeodor Matvyèich, a tall fellow of thirty-five, with a well-shaped head,\r\nand in whose fiery grey eyes there lurked a joyous twinkle, which told\r\nof a right merry nature within. He was the very incarnation of robust,\r\nmirthful manhood, and I knew that during the brief period he had been in\r\nEngland he had been exceedingly popular among the attachés. I had no\r\nidea, however, that he was the Chief of the Secret Police of Moscow, and\r\nthat he was in London endeavouring to elucidate some mystery connected\r\nwith the plot he had discovered.\r\n\r\nWhen, shortly before the dawn, Sophie and I were driving home, I remarked\r\nthat the Captain was a pleasant fellow, in order to cause her to talk of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut with a pre-occupied air she merely answered, “Yes, charming.” Then\r\nshe turned our conversation into a different channel.\r\n\r\nA few days later Matvyèich called, and I was introduced by Sophie as her\r\nbrother. Soon he became a constant visitor, and we three frequently dined\r\nand afterwards went to places of amusement together.\r\n\r\nAs time went on it was plain that Sophie’s love for him increased, while\r\non his part he adored her, sending her boxes of choice flowers daily, and\r\nmaking her several costly presents of jewellery. I became more puzzled as\r\nto the object of her mission by an event which occurred about three weeks\r\nlater. I had been out during the day, and returned about seven o’clock.\r\nAs I passed the door of our sitting-room I noticed that it was ajar, and\r\npushing it open, entered noiselessly.\r\n\r\nSophie, who did not notice my entrance, stood facing the fire, bending\r\nand examining intently something she held in her hand.\r\n\r\nCreeping up behind her, and peeping over her shoulder, I saw, to my\r\nsurprise, that she held in her hand a morocco case, containing a pretty\r\nornament, evidently intended for the adornment of the hair. It was in the\r\nshape of a rapier, the tapering blade being of steel, while the hilt was\r\nset with diamonds.\r\n\r\nIntending to frighten her, I suddenly grasped her wrist, and snatched the\r\nornament from its bed of crimson satin.\r\n\r\n“_Dieu!_” she cried, “I—I didn’t know you were here, Anton. You startled\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“What a pretty pin,” I remarked. “Where did you get it from?”\r\n\r\n“It is mine,” she replied.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I made pretence of lunging at her with it, when she shrank\r\nback with expressions of fear and repugnance that amazed me.\r\n\r\n“Is it sharp?” I inquired, feeling the point with my thumb.\r\n\r\n“_Gran’ Dieu!_ what would you do? You will kill yourself!” she cried in\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked, as she wrested the pin from my fingers.\r\n\r\n“I mean that a puncture with this would prove fatal,” she said in a low,\r\nserious tone. “You understand?”\r\n\r\n“Is it poisoned, then?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head, and, holding the pin nearer the shaded lamp, showed\r\nthat for about an inch from the point it was discoloured by some black\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n“Why do you carry about such a dangerous weapon?”\r\n\r\n“Cannot you guess?” she asked hoarsely, at the same time unbuttoning the\r\nbreast of her dress, and drawing forth a letter, which she handed me.\r\nThen she sank into a chair, and covering her face with her small white\r\nhands, burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe letter was in Russian. It acknowledged receipt of the facts regarding\r\nFeodor Matvyèich, and stated that the death sentence had been passed upon\r\nhim. Appended was the warrant of the Moscow Circle, ordering her to kill\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the object of her secret mission was plain.\r\n\r\n“And you love him, Sophie?” I said in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she sobbed. “I came here to discover how he intended to act on\r\nhis return to Moscow. I have betrayed him, and the Circle have passed\r\nsentence. In spite of myself, I have grown to love him, and must save\r\nhim. But how can I? To warn him would be to place the whole Circle in\r\ndanger, besides bringing the vengeance of the Party upon myself.”\r\n\r\nJumping up, she paced the room excitedly, while I stood watching her\r\nsorrowfully, unable to give advice or render assistance.\r\n\r\nAs I stood, meditative and silent, a servant entered with a card. She\r\nglanced at it, drew a long breath, and exclaimed, “Captain Matvyèich!\r\nShow him up!”\r\n\r\nClosing the little morocco case with a snap, she put it quickly into the\r\npocket of her dress, and replaced the letter in her breast. Scarcely had\r\nshe rebuttoned her bodice, when Feodor entered, and she went forward to\r\nmeet him with a smile and an expression of glad welcome. He grasped her\r\nhand—the hand that was ordered to deal the death-blow!\r\n\r\nThen he greeted me, and we seated ourselves before the fire.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, after we had been conversing for several minutes, “this\r\nis my last visit here.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going away?” asked Sophie, in dismay.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dearest, I start for Moscow to-morrow. I have some important work\r\nto perform, and have come to-night to wish you farewell.”\r\n\r\n“So soon?” she said sorrowfully. “When will you return?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps never. I only came here to endeavour to discover a woman whose\r\nChristian name was the same as your own.”\r\n\r\n“What did you want with her?”\r\n\r\n“To arrest her, and demand her extradition. It was she who killed my\r\npredecessor—General Yagodkin.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I remember,” I said. “She escaped from Russia.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she’s a most dangerous Nihilist, and many recent plots have been\r\ndue to her inventative genius. If I find her she will go to the gallows.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t talk of such horrors, Feodor!” exclaimed Sophie, who had\r\nturned somewhat pale, and involuntarily shuddered. “How cold it is! I\r\nmust go and get a shawl.”\r\n\r\nAnd she rose and went out.\r\n\r\nFor nearly half an hour she was absent, while Matvyèich and I smoked,\r\ndrank our whiskys and sodas, and chatted. Then she returned, and together\r\nwe wished him farewell and _bon voyage_.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks passed. Sophie and I, by means of false passports, had\r\njourneyed to Moscow. She had decided to run all risks in warning her\r\nlover of his impending danger, and had persuaded me to accompany her, in\r\norder to allay suspicion. We had taken up our quarters at the Hôtel de\r\nDresde, and frequented the boulevards and summer gardens daily, in order\r\nto meet him alone, for we dare not call at the Bureau of Police.\r\n\r\nBy means only known to the members of our Party we were quickly\r\nintroduced into the circle of official society, in order that Sophie\r\nmight complete her mission. One evening we accepted an invitation to dine\r\nat the house of a wealthy merchant who lived in the Bolshoi Dmietriefka,\r\nhaving previously ascertained that Feodor Matvyèich was also to be a\r\nguest.\r\n\r\nHis surprise and pleasure were unbounded when we met prior to going\r\nin to dinner. Sophie looked bewitching and brilliant in a well-fitting\r\nevening gown, with her hair dressed in Grecian fashion; but one thing\r\ncaused me alarm. She wore in her hair the poisoned ornament.\r\n\r\nThe dinner party was a large one, and Matvyèich sat between myself and\r\nmy “sister.” Over the meal we chatted merrily, she explaining how, owing\r\nto financial business connected with her late father’s estate, she had\r\nbeen compelled to travel to Russia. After we had joined the ladies in\r\nthe drawing-room I saw her in earnest conversation with him, and noticed\r\nthat they presently walked together into an adjoining room, which was\r\nunoccupied. From her movements and agitated manner I surmised that\r\nthe time had come when she intended to warn him, therefore I followed\r\nnoiselessly, and overheard their conversation.\r\n\r\n“Well, _ma chère_, what is this great secret of yours?” he asked, smiling\r\nand balancing himself upon the edge of the table.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she whispered. “Some one may hear us. If they did, it would be\r\nfatal.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? Why all this mystery?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that you are condemned to die!”\r\n\r\n“To die?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You will die in the same manner as General Yagodkin. The Nihilists\r\nhave condemned you.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me—how do you know?” he asked, breathlessly excited, and pale with\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she urged. “Speak lower. I—I know you love me, Feodor. I have not\r\nforgotten your words when in London. You asked me to be your wife; but,\r\nalas! I can never be more to you than what I am—a friend—although we love\r\none another so well.”\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered as she spoke; the last words of the sentence were\r\nalmost lost in choking sobs.\r\n\r\n“And why?” he asked, slipping his arm around her waist and drawing her\r\nhead down upon his gold-braided uniform coat.\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, gently disengaging herself from his embrace.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” she said, in a hoarse, fierce whisper. “I have journeyed here,\r\nto Moscow, on purpose to warn you of your danger. I leave to-night, and\r\nyou will never again see me. I am here at great risk, for my life would\r\nbe taken by the Terrorists if they knew I had given you warning; whereas,\r\nif the Bureau of the Third Section knew of my presence on Russian soil,\r\nthey would undoubtedly arrest me.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, are you?” asked the Captain, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“You know me, surely?” she answered, with a harsh, strained laugh.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I heard voices behind me, and, turning quickly, saw three\r\npolice officers in uniform at the door.\r\n\r\n“There she is!” cried one. “I recognise her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; let us enter.”\r\n\r\nBrushing past me, the men unceremoniously burst into the room.\r\n\r\n“What means this intrusion?” demanded Matvyèich fiercely.\r\n\r\nThe men saluted, but before they could explain a grey-headed man in\r\nordinary dress pushed forward, and, walking up to my “sister,” exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“Sophie Zagarovna! I arrest you for murder, by order of our Imperial\r\nMaster, the Tzar!”\r\n\r\n“_Dieu!_” cried the Chief of Secret Police.\r\n\r\n“Sophie Zagarovna! You—you must be mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Tseklinski!” gasped Sophie, deathly pale, shrinking from the man who had\r\naddressed her. “It is you! By Heaven! then we meet, and—and you are the\r\nvictor! Once I spared your life as I have spared Feodor’s, and this is\r\nhow you repay me—by arrest! I love Feodor, but I know there is no hope of\r\nhappiness now I have fallen into your clutches.”\r\n\r\n“You have deceived me,” cried Matvyèich, angry and bewildered at this\r\nrevelation. “I have loved and trusted a murderess!”\r\n\r\n“I—I have risked my life to save you,” she said wildly. “Kiss me once—for\r\nthe last time,” she implored.\r\n\r\nHe flung her from him with an expression of disgust, coupled with an\r\noath.\r\n\r\n“You—you cast me aside!” she cried, in dismay. “Then I care nothing for\r\nmy future.” Addressing Tseklinski, whom I recognised as the renowned\r\nand expert Petersburg detective, she shrieked, “When you were my\r\nlover I protected you; and through me you escaped the plot for your\r\nassassination. Now you arrest me for murder, merely because I removed a\r\ntyrant whose inhuman delight was to send innocent persons to Kara——”\r\n\r\n“Enough, jade!” cried Tseklinski, his face flushed with rage. “We have\r\nsought for you long enough, and if Captain Matvyèich is weak enough to be\r\ntricked and fooled by you, I am not.”\r\n\r\nTurning to the officers, he added—\r\n\r\n“Arrest her, and take her to the Bureau at once.”\r\n\r\nThe men advanced to obey their chief’s command, but ere they could lay a\r\nfinger upon her she had staggered backward, and had fallen fainting upon\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nThey stooped to raise her, but a look of horror overspread their\r\ncountenances as one of them removed his hand from the back of her head\r\nand found blood upon it.\r\n\r\nTseklinski bent, gazed into her face, placed his hand upon her heart, and\r\nlistened intently.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” he exclaimed, in a tone of awe.\r\n\r\nI rushed forward to ascertain the truth. In a moment it flashed upon me.\r\nThe pin she had worn in her hair had, by the force of the fall, been\r\ndriven into her scalp, and the deadly Obeah poison upon the point had\r\ncaused almost instant death.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange vagary of Fate. The harmless-looking weapon with which\r\nshe had originally intended to assassinate the newly-appointed Chief of\r\nPolice had caused her own death. Yet even that was preferable to the\r\npunishment that awaited her had she lived.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment only I glanced upon the blanched, handsome features,\r\nthen hurried from the house. Before midnight I had left Moscow, and was\r\non my way back to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBY A VANISHED HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI met Felix Karelin in a rather curious manner. I had been visiting two\r\nrefugees, Dobroslavin and Bolomez, who lived in Little Alie Street,\r\nWhitechapel, and about six o’clock one July evening was walking along\r\nLeman Street towards Aldgate Station, intending to take train to the West\r\nEnd. As I turned the corner into Commercial Road, an aged, decrepit,\r\nblind man accidentally stumbled against me. Bent, haggard, and attired in\r\na ragged frock-coat, green with age, wearing a battered silk hat, the nap\r\nof which had long ago disappeared, he looked unutterably miserable and\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\nHalting, and tapping with his stick, he exclaimed in broken English: “I\r\nbeg your pardon, sir.”\r\n\r\nHe was moving onward when I caught him by the arm. There was an accent in\r\nhis voice that I recognised.\r\n\r\n“What nationality are you?” I asked in Russian.\r\n\r\nIn the same language he replied that he was a native of Petersburg, and\r\nan escaped political exile.\r\n\r\n“A political!” I repeated, in surprise, as all escaped revolutionists in\r\nLondon were well known to us, and many received money regularly from our\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said; “I escaped from the Algachi silver mines a year ago. But\r\nyou are Russian also.”\r\n\r\nI replied in the affirmative. He at once urged me to accompany him to\r\nhis lodgings, where we could talk. “It is only in Briton’s Court, St.\r\nGeorge’s Road, not far from here,” he urged.\r\n\r\nFeeling a sudden interest in the old man, I acceded to his request,\r\nand he led me up and down several narrow, squalid streets, with which\r\nhe was evidently well acquainted. At length we turned down a dirty,\r\nevil-smelling court, and he stopped before a small house at the further\r\nend. He opened the door with a latch-key, and I followed him upstairs.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered his sitting-room on the upper floor I was astonished to\r\nfind it bright and comfortably furnished. One would never have expected\r\nsuch a clean, cosy room in a house of that character, situate as it was\r\nin one of the lowest quarters of the metropolis. Crimson damask curtains\r\nhung from a neat gilt cornice; in the centre of the room was a round\r\ntable, upon which tea was laid, and seated at the window, reclining in\r\na cane rocking-chair, was a pretty fair-haired girl of about sixteen\r\nreading a novel.\r\n\r\nRising as we entered, she glanced shyly at me.\r\n\r\n“Elyòna, I’ve brought a friend, one of our compatriots, whose name,\r\nhowever, I have not the pleasure of knowing.”\r\n\r\n“Ivan Lipatkin,” I replied, uttering the first name that crossed my mind.\r\nI considered it politic to conceal my identity until I knew more about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis daughter smiled, shook hands, and welcomed me.\r\n\r\n“You are more comfortable here than in Algachi,” I said, glancing around.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied. “Although I am blind and helpless, I am not exactly\r\ndestitute.”\r\n\r\nWe took tea together, and were quite a merry trio. Elyòna Karelin was\r\ncharming, and her father’s conversation was that of an educated and\r\ncultured man.\r\n\r\nAfter I had given him a fictitious account of myself, he told me his\r\nstory. He was a lapidary in Petersburg, and had been thrice arrested\r\nand confined in one of the bomb-proof casemates of the Prison of\r\nPetropaulovsk, because it was alleged that his freedom was “prejudicial\r\nto public order.” On the last occasion of his arrest he was condemned\r\nto hard labour for life, and sent across Siberia to the dreaded mining\r\ndistrict beyond Irkutsk. His daughter went into voluntary exile with him,\r\nand they remained at Algachi four years. At length, aided by a Cossack\r\nofficer who took compassion on the decrepit old man and his devoted\r\nchild, Karelin succeeded in escaping. He then became a _brodyag_, or\r\nescaped convict who wanders about the country subsisting upon what he\r\ncan beg or steal, but always travelling towards the west. In this way\r\nhe managed to walk nearly a thousand miles towards the Ourals, when by\r\ngood chance he fell in with a train of freight sleighs going to Nijni\r\nNovgorod fair. One of the drivers had fallen ill and died, therefore he\r\ndisguised himself in the dead man’s clothes and took his place, having\r\nfirst, however, succeeded, with the help of some of the other men, in\r\nfiling away his leg-irons. His clothes with the yellow diamond upon them\r\nhe buried in a snowdrift, and with the dead man’s passport was allowed to\r\npass safely back to Europe, after an absence of nearly five years.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival, however, he was stricken down by fever, and lost\r\nhis eyesight. In Kazan he was joined by Elyòna, who had followed him.\r\nAfterwards they came to England.\r\n\r\nThe story of the daughter’s earnest affection was a touching one, and\r\nas the old man related it tears fell from his sightless eyes. The whole\r\nnarrative was intensely interesting to me, inasmuch as his description\r\nof the terrible hardships of deportation by road, of life in the filthy,\r\ninsanitary _étapes_, and the horrors of the Tomsk _perisilni_, were all\r\nwell known and vivid in my own recollection. It was evident that the poor\r\nold man had been subjected to the same inhuman brutality that had wrecked\r\nso many thousand lives, and none could sympathise with him more sincerely\r\nthan myself.\r\n\r\nWithout giving him any idea that I also had been exiled to the Great\r\nPrison Land, I questioned him upon various points, and his replies,\r\none and all, were those of a man who had suffered in the same manner.\r\nBesides, his head had been shaved, for upon one side his white locks were\r\nthin, while on the other they grew thickly, and were of an iron grey.\r\n\r\n“What can I do?” he asked mournfully, when he had concluded his story.\r\n“The money I have will not last me much longer. I must seek work.”\r\n\r\n“But you are blind!” I exclaimed, looking into his dull, bleared, stony\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes; nevertheless I can still do my work. One can feel to cut and polish\r\ngems better than using the keenest eyesight. For three months prior to\r\ncoming here I was employed at the Roeterseiland factory at Amsterdam. Do\r\nyou know any one in London who wants a workman?”\r\n\r\nI was silent. I happened to know a wealthy Jew diamond merchant,\r\nGoldberg by name, who lived in that dingy thoroughfare which contains\r\nmore wealth, perhaps, than the whole of the rest of London—Hatton Garden.\r\n\r\n“Ah! you do not speak,” he said entreatingly, laying his thin hand upon\r\nmy arm. “If you do know any one, give me an introduction to them, and as\r\na Russian and a brother, I shall thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, do,” urged Elyòna, jumping to her feet and placing her arm\r\naffectionately around her father’s neck. “He must do some work, or we\r\nshall starve.”\r\n\r\nI hesitated, reflected upon the curious fact that this man, being an\r\nescaped “political,” was not included in our list. It was useless to give\r\nhim the Nihilist sign, for he could not see.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said presently, “I know one gentleman, a dealer in gems, who\r\nfrequently employs lapidaries. If you like I’ll speak to him to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nBoth father and daughter thanked me effusively, and I took a leaf from\r\nmy pocket-book and wrote Goldberg’s name and address, at the same time\r\npromising to call personally and interest myself on his behalf.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards I bade them farewell, and walked homeward through the\r\ncity in a very meditative frame of mind.\r\n\r\nWithin a week of my first meeting with Karelin, he was engaged by\r\nGoldberg, who found him an excellent workman. The delicate sense of\r\ntouch that he had developed caused him to exercise far greater care over\r\nhis work than the ordinary lapidary, and Goldberg expressed a belief that\r\nthe old man was the best diamond polisher in London.\r\n\r\nI was glad I had been enabled to render the blind man a service, while\r\non his part he continually overwhelmed me with heartfelt gratitude. We\r\nmet frequently, and although I refrained from explaining my connection\r\nwith the Revolutionary Party, I introduced him to several minor Members\r\nof Parliament and other persons who were advocates of Russian freedom,\r\nand who made the National Liberal Club their headquarters. The old blind\r\nman and his daughter were invited to numbers of houses, and much sympathy\r\nwas shown them. Elyòna was petted by the ladies, and her father appeared\r\nnever tired of describing the terrors of administrative exile.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice he lectured; on the first occasion at the National Liberal\r\nClub, and afterwards at various halls in the metropolis. The title of his\r\nlecture was “My Life in Siberia,” and great crowds assembled to hear him,\r\nwhile the newspapers reported his observations and criticisms at unusual\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had been exiled as “a dangerous political,” he denied that he\r\nhad ever entertained revolutionary ideas, and expressed his disagreement\r\nwith the propaganda of the Nihilists. By reason of that expression I\r\nrefrained from admitting that I was a Terrorist. Of course I had reported\r\nto the Executive, and my instructions were to watch him narrowly and\r\npenetrate the mystery enveloping his past.\r\n\r\nAt this period it chanced that we were unusually active with our\r\npropaganda, especially in Poland, and the Government viewed their\r\nfutile efforts to suppress the circulation of revolutionary literature\r\nwith increasing alarm. They were aware that the majority of the books,\r\npamphlets, and manifestoes came from England, yet they were utterly\r\nunable to discover the means by which they evaded the censorship.\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy document which was being circulated by hundreds of\r\nthousands throughout the length and breadth of the Russian Empire was the\r\nnew programme of the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n“By fundamental conviction we are Socialists and Democrats,” was the\r\ntranslation of the opening sentence. Then it proceeded as follows: “We\r\nare satisfied that only through socialistic principles can the human race\r\nacquire liberty, equality, and fraternity; secure the full and harmonious\r\ndevelopment of the individual as well as the material prosperity of all;\r\nand thus make progress. The welfare of the people and the will of the\r\npeople are our two most sacred and most inseparable principles.” The\r\ndocument went on to criticise severely the condition of the country\r\nunder the Tzar Alexander III., and pointed out that in view of the stated\r\naim of the Party its operations might be classified under the heads of\r\npropaganda, destructive activity, the organisation of secret societies,\r\nand the organisation of the revolution.\r\n\r\nClause 2, headed “Destructive and Terroristic Activity,” was perhaps the\r\none most calculated to inspire the Tzar and his Government with feelings\r\nof insecurity and fear. The intentions of the Party were expressed boldly\r\nin the following terms: “Terroristic activity consists in the destruction\r\nof the most harmful persons in the Government, the protection of the\r\nParty from spies, and the punishment of official lawlessness and violence\r\nin all the more prominent and important cases in which such lawlessness\r\nand violence are manifested. The aim of such activity is to break down\r\nthe prestige of Governmental power, to furnish continuous proof of the\r\npossibility of carrying on a contest against the Government, to raise in\r\nthat way the revolutionary spirit of the people, and inspire belief in\r\nthe practicability of revolution, and, finally, to form a body suited and\r\naccustomed to warfare.”\r\n\r\nSo active were the police that it had been impossible to establish a\r\nsecret press in Russia with any degree of safety; hence it was that Boris\r\nDobroslavin and Isaac Bolomez, two working printers of Warsaw, had come\r\nto London for the purpose of printing revolutionary literature, which\r\nwas afterwards smuggled across the Russian frontier.\r\n\r\nThe house in which they had established themselves was one of those\r\nsmall, old-fashioned, grimy private dwellings of the usual type found in\r\nthe East End, and in the back parlour they had fitted up a hand-press,\r\nwhile in an upstairs room they did the work of composing in Russian type\r\nwhich they had brought from Poland.\r\n\r\nHere the manifestoes and pamphlets issued by the Executive were printed,\r\nand by means only known to our Organisation conveyed into Russia and\r\nSiberia to be circulated secretly. For nearly a year the dissemination of\r\nTerrorist literature had been going on, and we were gradually flooding\r\nthe Empire with documents advocating freedom.\r\n\r\nDobroslavin and Bolomez were pleasant, easy-going fellows, and one\r\nday while walking with Karelin in the Whitechapel Road I met them and\r\nintroduced him. They had previously heard me speak of the blind exile,\r\nand were at once interested in him, inviting him to their house. During\r\nthe weeks that followed we four often spent evenings together at Little\r\nAlie Street, although it must be remembered that no intimation was ever\r\ngiven to Karelin of the nature of the business that was carried on there,\r\nor was he ever shown into the work-rooms.\r\n\r\nElyòna sometimes accompanied her father, and on those occasions would\r\nsing some of those old Polish love-songs that touch the heart of the\r\nexiled patriotic Russian. She possessed a pretty contralto voice, and\r\ngenerally accompanied herself upon an old mandoline, which she played\r\nwith considerable skill.\r\n\r\nOne evening an incident occurred that puzzled me greatly. We had been\r\nchatting together in the front sitting-room, and Boris and Isaac had\r\nleft the room in order to consult in private upon a note they had\r\njust received from the Executive. Karelin and myself were sitting in\r\narmchairs on either side of the fireplace, when I noticed that on a\r\ntable, immediately behind my companion, there lay a half-printed copy\r\nof a sixteen-page pamphlet entitled “To-morrow,” which, couched in\r\ninflammatory language, had been so largely circulated as to cause the\r\ngreatest consternation among members of the “Third Section,” who were\r\nutterly at a loss to discover who was primarily responsible for the\r\nmultiplication of this severe and ruthless criticism of the Imperial\r\nAutocrat.\r\n\r\nAs I sat watching the old man’s expressionless face I could not help\r\nreflecting that it was a rash proceeding to allow such a document to lie\r\nabout openly. Yet I remembered that the old man was blind and could not\r\npossibly ascertain the nature of the printed paper. Just at that moment\r\nBolomez put his head inside the door and called me into the next room to\r\njoin in their conference.\r\n\r\nWhen, five minutes later, I returned to the sitting-room, Karelin was\r\nstill in the attitude in which I had left him, but the pamphlet was no\r\nlonger there!\r\n\r\nIts disappearance surprised me, for it seemed quite as impossible that\r\nany one had entered the room and taken it during my brief absence as that\r\nthe blind man had discovered it. It was upon my tongue to remark upon it,\r\nbut I hesitated, perceiving that to refer to it might whet the old man’s\r\ncuriosity and arouse his suspicions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the disappearance of the pamphlet was a mystery, and I\r\ndetermined upon finding out whether he had purloined it, and if so, the\r\nobject of the theft.\r\n\r\nA few days later I called upon Goldberg. His house was at the end of that\r\nlong row of gloomy second-rate-looking residences, with deep basements\r\nand flights of stone steps leading to the front doors, which line one\r\nside of Hatton Garden. There was nothing in the exterior to attract the\r\nattention of any enterprising burglar, with the exception, perhaps, of\r\nthe iron bars which protected the windows in the area, and even the\r\nshining brass plate bore simply the name, “F. Goldberg,” without any\r\nindication of his business. Inside, in the room used as office, the\r\nfeature one would have expected to find—namely, a great green-painted\r\niron safe with enormous handles and hinges—was absent. The room was\r\nnothing more than a comfortable library with well-filled bookcases around\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Goldberg was busy writing letters. Rising, he grasped my\r\nhand, and, greeting me warmly, bade me be seated in the client’s chair.\r\n\r\n“You would like to see your blind _protégé_ at work, eh?” he said, when\r\nwe had been chatting some time. “Well, you shall. He’s a marvellous\r\nworkman. See, here’s a stone he finished this morning;” and taking from\r\na drawer in his writing-table a tiny round cardboard box, he removed the\r\nlid and handed it to me. Lying in its bed of pink cotton wool was an\r\nenormous yellow diamond, which flashed and gleamed in the ray of sunlight\r\nthat strayed into the room.\r\n\r\n“How much is it worth?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“My price is a thousand pounds,” he replied. “That particular one,\r\nhowever, has been ordered by a jeweller, and is to form the centre of an\r\nornament which, in a few weeks’ time, will be presented by a bridegroom\r\nto his bride.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to see Karelin at work,” I said.\r\n\r\nMy friend acquiesced willingly, and took me upstairs to a small back\r\nroom, where the old man was seated. He was busily engaged “cleaving”\r\na rough diamond by means of another sharp-edged gem. In order that he\r\nshould not be aware of my presence, I did not speak. His master addressed\r\nsome words to him regarding his work, which the old lapidary answered\r\nwithout turning his sightless eyes towards us. The careful and accurate\r\nmanner in which he worked was little short of marvellous, for he stopped\r\nevery few moments to feel with the tip of his forefinger the precise\r\ndimensions of the incision he was making in the stone.\r\n\r\nMy object in seeing him at work was twofold. The first was to watch the\r\nmovement of his face, but I found that it wore the blank, expressionless\r\nlook of a blind man. The second was to make an investigation. His coat\r\nwas hanging upon a nail behind the door, and holding up my finger to my\r\nfriend as an indication of secrecy, I crossed noiselessly to the garment,\r\nand placing my hand in the breast-pocket, abstracted its contents.\r\n\r\nA momentary glance was sufficient to detect the object which I sought,\r\nfor, folded in half and lying among a number of letters and bills, was\r\nthe missing copy of the revolutionary pamphlet.\r\n\r\nI pushed the papers back hurriedly, and with Goldberg left the old man’s\r\nworkshop. I was sorely puzzled to know what the blind man wanted with a\r\ndocument of that description, and after replying evasively to Goldberg’s\r\nquestions, I bade him farewell, and left.\r\n\r\nOne evening I visited the house in Little Alie Street and found\r\nDobroslavin, Bolomez, and Karelin smoking together in the dingy little\r\nsitting-room. We sat gossiping for an hour, when the old man knocked the\r\nashes from his pipe, and rising, said, “I must be going now. I promised\r\nElyòna to return early. She will be so lonely, poor child.”\r\n\r\nThe tender manner in which he spoke of her touched me, and I reflected\r\nupon her dull and lonely life, for she was unable to speak English, and\r\nhad no friends.\r\n\r\n“I will see you home,” I said, and presently we set out and walked\r\ntogether to his humble abode. Elyòna was sitting as usual, bright and\r\ncheerful, ready to welcome him. She jumped to her feet, kissed him\r\naffectionately, ran to get his slippers, and bestowed upon him various\r\nlittle attentions which showed how great was the affection between father\r\nand daughter.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining chatting with her for half an hour, I returned to\r\nLittle Alie Street, but judge my astonishment when I found that a\r\ncrowd had assembled outside the house. Hastily inquiring the nature of\r\nthe disturbance, I was informed by a lad that a police inspector had\r\nentered the place. Such intelligence naturally caused me a good deal of\r\nconsternation, but I remembered that it was no offence against English\r\nlaw to print Russian pamphlets.\r\n\r\nI resolved to put on a bold front and enter the premises.\r\n\r\nAs I was forcing my way through the crowd to the door, the latter opened,\r\nand I saw Dobroslavin and Bolomez in the custody of several constables.\r\n\r\n“For what am I arrested?” I heard Bolomez ask in his broken English.\r\n\r\n“You’ve already been told,” the constable replied. “Come, you’d best go\r\nquietly.”\r\n\r\nNeither of my two fellow-conspirators saw me, for I was standing among\r\nthe crowd of Whitechapel rabble; but as soon as they started to walk I\r\nfollowed them to the Leman Street Police Station—famed in the history of\r\nLondon crime as the headquarters of the police when searching for “Jack\r\nthe Ripper.” On arrival I hesitated whether to follow them into the\r\nstation, but at length decided not to do so, lest I might run unnecessary\r\nrisks and be identified as a too-frequent visitor at the house that had\r\njust been raided.\r\n\r\nHaving in vain attempted to ascertain the exact nature of the offence\r\nwith which Dobroslavin and Bolomez were charged, I hurried away to\r\nAldgate and went by rail to Edgware Road, taking a cab thence to Oakleigh\r\nGardens in order to report our misfortune to the Executive.\r\n\r\nWith feelings of intense anxiety I sat in the Thames Police Court on the\r\nfollowing morning, awaiting the two prisoners to be brought before the\r\nmagistrate. Presently, after the usual applications for summonses and the\r\nhearing of night charges, my two compatriots were placed in the dock.\r\n\r\n“Boris Dobroslavin and Isaac Bolomez, you are charged with having forged\r\nRussian banknotes in your possession, and further, with manufacturing\r\nthem at No. 132, Little Alie Street,” exclaimed the clerk of the court.\r\n\r\nForged notes! Impossible, I thought. The press was used for no other\r\npurpose than for printing revolutionary literature. The evidence,\r\nhowever, was extraordinary. As I sat listening to it I could scarce\r\nbelieve my ears.\r\n\r\nThe first witness was a police inspector, who made the following\r\nstatement: “A warrant to search the premises, 132, Little Alie Street,\r\nwas given into my hands, and last night I went there with other officers.\r\nIn answer to a knock, the prisoner Bolomez opened the door, and we at\r\nonce searched the place. In the back room on the ground floor we found\r\na printing-press and printers’ materials, together with a very large\r\nnumber of pamphlets and circulars in Russian. On searching the front\r\nsitting-room, I found concealed under the cushion of the sofa four\r\nengraved copper plates, which have been used for printing Russian notes\r\nof the value of one and five roubles. In a drawer, in the same room,\r\nI found the bundles of forged notes I produce. They are all new, and\r\nrepresent a sum of 18,000 roubles. Two small tins of blue and yellow\r\nlithographic ink I found concealed behind a sideboard. I then caused both\r\nprisoners to be arrested.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to the magistrate, the officer said that a very large number\r\nof forged Russian notes were in circulation, and the Russian Finance\r\nDepartment had obtained information showing that they were being printed\r\nin London. A heavy reward had been offered, but although the London\r\npolice had been endeavouring to trace the offenders, they had not\r\nsucceeded until the present occasion.\r\n\r\nThe other evidence was corroborative. I was dumb with amazement, and the\r\ntwo prisoners seemed too much astonished at hearing the extraordinary\r\ncharge against them to make any effort to cross-examine the witnesses. At\r\nlength the case was remanded, and I left the court.\r\n\r\nThat day the Executive held a meeting to discuss the situation, but no\r\nsolution of the mystery was forthcoming; even the solicitor we employed\r\nto defend entertained little hope of being able to make a satisfactory\r\ndefence in the face of such undeniable evidence.\r\n\r\nFor three days following the arrest of Boris and Isaac, and the seizure\r\nof our press, I was too busy to call on Karelin, but I expected that he\r\nhad heard of the reports in the papers, with the sensational headlines,\r\n“Clever Capture of Banknote Forgers: Thousands of False Notes.” On\r\nthe fourth morning, about nine o’clock, I chanced to be walking along\r\nFarringdon Road, when it suddenly occurred to me to call at Goldberg’s,\r\nand tell the old lapidary how narrowly he had escaped arrest.\r\n\r\nWhen the lad admitted me I met his master talking excitedly with two men\r\nin the hall.\r\n\r\n“It’s a most clever robbery,” I heard one of the men say. “The thief was\r\nevidently an expert.”\r\n\r\n“Robbery!” I echoed. “What’s the matter, Goldberg?”\r\n\r\n“My safe has been ransacked!” he cried wildly. “See, here!” and he pulled\r\nme into his private room.\r\n\r\nBookcases completely lined the walls, but one of these was false,\r\ncontaining only the backs of books behind a glass door. On pressing a\r\nspring it opened, revealing a great safe imbedded in the wall, and large\r\nenough for a man to enter. Both doors now stood open, and the place was\r\nin great confusion. The drawers in the safe had been sacked, the little\r\nboxes that had contained cut and uncut gems had been emptied and cast\r\naside, while papers had been tossed carelessly upon the floor.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” I asked, amazed.\r\n\r\n“It means that I have lost every gem I possessed. They were worth twenty\r\nthousand pounds, and included the great yellow diamond which Karelin cut\r\nso beautifully. The burglars, whoever they were, gained admittance by the\r\narea window after filing away three of the bars.”\r\n\r\nOne of the detectives remarked that it was strange Karelin had not come\r\nto work as usual that morning, and at his request I accompanied him in a\r\ncab to Briton’s Court.\r\n\r\nMy knock at the door was answered by an obese, slatternly woman, who, in\r\nreply to my question, said—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Karelin’s gone away.”\r\n\r\n“Gone!” I gasped.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he came ’ome yesterday about five o’clock, and an ’our afterwards\r\nleft with his daughter. They took a small box with them, and said they\r\nwould probably be absent a month or so.”\r\n\r\n“He is the thief,” the detective briefly remarked, turning to me.\r\n\r\nWe searched his rooms, but found nothing to show the direction of his\r\nflight. I then accompanied the officer to Leman Street Police Station,\r\nwhere I gave a detailed description of the fugitive and his daughter,\r\nwhich was wired to every police station in the metropolitan area. An\r\nhour later information was telegraphed to the ports of departure for the\r\nContinent, together with a description of the stolen gems. As, however,\r\nweeks passed without tidings of him, it was evident that he and his\r\naffectionate daughter had succeeded in getting out of England with their\r\nbooty.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated case of forging Russian notes, tried at the Old Bailey,\r\nis no doubt still remembered by many readers. The evidence for the\r\nprosecution was conclusive, the jury returned a verdict of “guilty,”\r\nand Dobroslavin and Bolomez were each sentenced to seven years’ penal\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nSubsequent inquiries made by our Party, together with an incident that\r\noccurred at Amsterdam, revealed some remarkable facts. Six months after\r\nthe two innocent men had been sentenced we unravelled the mystery\r\nsurrounding Karelin, and discovered that he was a genuine escaped exile,\r\nbut not a “political.” On the contrary, he was accredited by the Russian\r\npolice as the most expert diamond thief in the whole empire, and for\r\nrobbing a jeweller in Kovno he had been sent to Siberia with a yellow\r\ndiamond upon his back. For many years he had had an affection of the\r\neyes, but his blindness was only feigned, and the girl Elyòna was not his\r\ndaughter, but a clever accomplice.\r\n\r\nAfter his escape from the mines he entered the Russian Secret Service\r\nas spy. The Government, viewing with alarm the increasing flood of\r\nrevolutionary literature emanating from England, saw that the only way\r\nto stop it was to get the men who were responsible imprisoned for a term\r\nof years. With this object the _agent provocateur_ we knew as Karelin\r\nassumed the character of a blind lapidary, obtained an entrance to the\r\nhouse in Little Alie Street, and, when his plans were ripe, secreted the\r\nplates and forged notes in the room, first, however, giving anonymous\r\nwarning to the Metropolitan Police. The result was that two innocent\r\nmen were convicted, and placed where they could do nothing to annoy the\r\nGovernment of Russia.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dobroslavin and Bolomez are still at Portland, Karelin met with\r\nhis deserts. He did not escape our vigilance, for our Party found him in\r\nAmsterdam some months afterwards endeavouring to sell the great yellow\r\ndiamond that he had polished. He was arrested, extradited to England,\r\nand sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment, while about half of Goldberg’s\r\nproperty was recovered.\r\n\r\nNo trace, however, has yet been discovered of the charming Elyòna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA ROMANCE OF THE STEPPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur final glasses had been clinked; Mademoiselle had crossed herself\r\ndevoutly before the _ikon_ hanging over the door of the dingy old\r\npost-house at Uziansk, at the foot of the Ourals; and in a few moments\r\nour sleigh-bells were jingling merrily, and our runners hissing over the\r\nfrozen snow, as the pretty Russian and myself sped along in the bright\r\nmoonlight on our journey of over two thousand miles into Siberia. I was\r\non my way to the little town of Lebiázhia, on a secret mission, and was\r\ntravelling, as usual, with a false passport.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment I had been asked by my old friend, Paul Cherniávski,\r\nlieutenant in the Tzar’s Dragoons, to allow a friend of his to travel\r\nwith me to Irkutsk; and having consented, I had discovered, to my\r\nsurprise, that his friend—who was introduced to me only a quarter of an\r\nhour before as Mademoiselle Mariána Néstoff—was an exceedingly handsome,\r\ndark-eyed young lady of about twenty-two.\r\n\r\nWho she was I had no idea, and Paul did not enlighten me. He was the\r\nbest of good fellows, but in Petersburg he had always had a reputation\r\namong the fair sex; and one or two of his little affairs of the heart had\r\nafforded subjects for gossip, notably the coupling of his name with that\r\nof La Belle Estelle—a little French circus-rider, about whom he fought a\r\nduel.\r\n\r\nBut our adieux had been said; he had grumbled at being quartered in that\r\nout-of-the-world village; and soon my fair charge and I were out upon\r\nthe open, snow-covered steppe, where the telegraph poles and verst-posts\r\nran in a long black line to the horizon; and for a couple of hours the\r\nhorses, eager for a spin, galloped steadily, taking us along swift as the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n“Why are you going to Irkutsk?” I asked, after chatting for a long time\r\nwith my pretty travelling companion, who, under her rich furs, had\r\nnestled warmly at my side, and was smoking a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“You will pardon me, M’sieur, if I do not answer that question,” she\r\nreplied in musical French, moving uneasily. Then she whispered into my\r\near, “It—it is a secret!”\r\n\r\nWe were silent. I drew up the collar of my heavy coat and sat silent and\r\npuzzled; while upon my fair companion the rhythmic jingle of the bells\r\nand gliding motion of the sleigh must have had a soothing effect, for\r\nvery soon she closed her great lustrous eyes, and her head gradually\r\npillowed itself upon my shoulder. She fell fast asleep, and I drew her\r\nsoft otter hood across her white cheek to prevent frost-bite.\r\n\r\nShe was evidently tired out, for through the long night she slept\r\nsoundly, now and then murmuring low words that I could not catch. Her\r\nbeauty had enchanted me; the mystery surrounding her added to the intense\r\ninterest I felt in her. Even when, cramped by remaining in the same\r\nposition so as to allow her head to rest comfortably, my arm stole gently\r\naround her waist and drew her towards me, she did not wake. Indeed, she\r\nremained oblivious to her surroundings until, just as the wintry dawn was\r\nspreading, Ivan, our driver, pulled up at the post-house of the little\r\nvillage of Rytsaieva, having accomplished our first stage.\r\n\r\nThen, on opening her eyes and finding herself in my embrace, she blushed\r\ndeeply, apologised for being such an uninteresting companion, and,\r\nshivering, alighted and entered the small log-built house.\r\n\r\nDuring that day and the following night we remained at the post-house.\r\nThen each day passed much as its predecessor. While the light lasted we\r\nsped onward, putting up each night at the wretchedly dirty post-houses,\r\nat last crossing the frontier at Zverinogolovsk and entering that dreaded\r\nprison-land, Siberia. Gaining the Great Post-Road, we continued upon it\r\nday after day, week after week, over the barren snow-covered country\r\nthrough Ishim, Omsk, and Kolivan, until we reached Tomsk, one thousand\r\nmiles from our starting-point. Mariána was an enigma, and, even before we\r\nhad been companions a week, I found myself admiring her. Yet the mystery\r\nsurrounding her was most tantalising. Though apparently a provincial, she\r\nspoke of people in the highest circle in Petersburg in a manner which\r\nshowed them to be intimate friends, for many of the people about whom she\r\ngossiped so pleasantly were my own acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAt times I was inclined to regard her as a pure-minded girl whose safety\r\nhad been entrusted to me by Paul; yet, when I remembered that his life\r\nhad been one of joys without sorrow and loves without a morrow, I felt\r\nmore inclined to suspect her to be a handsome adventuress.\r\n\r\nTime after time we passed convicts dragging their leg-irons onward;\r\nmen and women with hope left far beyond the Ourals, and with looks of\r\nunutterable despair upon their care-lined brows, were trudging wearily\r\nthrough the snow with footsteps hastened by the terrible knout wielded by\r\nfierce, brutal Cossacks.\r\n\r\nMariána, as she gazed with pitying looks at the miserable, smileless\r\nbands, would sigh heavily and lapse into deep thought. Once only when,\r\njust as we were passing, a Cossack’s whip fell heavily upon the shoulders\r\nof a young woman who seemed very weak and ill, the sight moved her to\r\nangrily declare that the Russian penal code was a blot on the progress of\r\nmodern civilisation.\r\n\r\n“Such thoughts are best left unuttered here, Mademoiselle,” I said. “To\r\nrecklessly criticise his Majesty’s actions is a serious matter.”\r\n\r\n“I care nothing for that,” she answered defiantly. “If you knew half as\r\nmuch of the injustice, the bribery, and corruption that exist all over\r\nthe empire as I do, you would find it difficult to restrain your tongue.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke earnestly in French, so that Ivan, the driver, could not\r\nunderstand; and the vehemence of her words showed her to be suffering\r\nfrom some injustice. I was amazed at her violent denunciation. Suddenly a\r\nthought occurred to me, and bending, I whispered into her ear.\r\n\r\n“So Mademoiselle is a _Nihilist_?”\r\n\r\nShe started, turning pale. With trembling fingers she clutched my arm and\r\ngasped—\r\n\r\n“Who—who told you? Have I betrayed my secret?”\r\n\r\n“Words are an index to one’s convictions,” I replied briefly, smiling.\r\n“Now that I know that you are working for the Cause, surely I may know\r\nwhy you are going to Irkutsk.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” she cried, terribly agitated. “Do not let us discuss it. The driver\r\nmay understand, and—and it would mean _death_!”\r\n\r\n“Your secret is quite safe with me, Mariána,” I said, reassuringly,\r\ntaking her gloved hand in mine, and I uttered one word that gave her\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n“I—I do trust you,” she replied, in a low, faltering voice. “Ah! You do\r\nnot know my past!” And her breast heaved and fell in a long, deep-drawn\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n“May I not know it? Are the recollections so very bitter?”\r\n\r\n“Bitter!” she cried. “It is a story of wretched duplicity and dishonour.\r\nIf you knew all you would hate me; therefore it is best that I should\r\nkeep my secret hidden, and when we part you will perhaps sometimes\r\nremember me with kindly thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me one thing,” I demanded anxiously. “Is Paul Cherniávski your\r\nprotector?”\r\n\r\nShe held her breath, and as she looked at me I saw tears welling in her\r\nbright eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she faltered. “He—he is my only friend.”\r\n\r\nThe silence that ensued was long and painful. The truth, as far as it\r\nwent, was out, and I felt angry with myself.\r\n\r\nThat night, having halted at the lonely post-house of Artinsk, we sat in\r\nthe uncleanly common-room, and Mariána, as usual, served tea to Ivan and\r\nmyself from the _samovar_. As she handed the driver his cup I noticed\r\nthat his hand trembled and he looked at her with a strange, almost\r\ndemoniacal expression of hatred. In a moment, however, it had passed; yet\r\nthroughout the evening, while Mariána and I smoked our cigarettes and\r\nchatted to the old post-house keeper and his wife, the sole occupants, I\r\npondered over it, and at night little sleep came to my eyes.\r\n\r\nWas there some secret between them, or had he understood Mariána’s\r\nconfession?\r\n\r\nRising early, I went out into the clear, crisp air to smoke and think. It\r\nwas a lonely place, sixty miles to the nearest village. When I returned\r\nI found the post-house keeper speechless with terror, and at once\r\napprehended that some strange event had occurred. Judge my amazement and\r\nhorror, however, when he half dragged me to a room where I saw Ivan, the\r\ndriver, lying upon his truckle bed fully dressed. He had been stabbed to\r\nthe heart!\r\n\r\nMariána, who came from her room a moment later, was horrified, though\r\nshe declared that she was too much upset to enter to view the murdered\r\nman’s corpse. Pale, nervous, and haggard, she whispered in French a wish\r\nto get away as quickly as possible, and so agitated did she become when\r\nI announced my intention of going on to Irkutsk, four hundred versts\r\ndistant, to inform the police, that suspicions were at once aroused in my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nI noticed, too, a deep scratch across her delicate wrist. How did she get\r\nit? Her actions were strange, and she was so anxious to get away from the\r\nscene of the crime that I at last became convinced of her guilt.\r\n\r\nMy fair travelling companion was a murderess!\r\n\r\nWe arrived in the Siberian city of Irkutsk one afternoon in December, and\r\ntook tea at the post-house. Before we had finished our meal Mariána, who,\r\nthough very pale, looked undeniably beautiful in a dress richly trimmed\r\nwith otter, suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Has any one seen the lady who arrived with me?” I asked presently of the\r\nmen who were warming themselves around the stove.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied a man who had just entered, and was shaking the snow from\r\nhis sheepskin. “I saw her entering the Governor’s Palace.” Then he added,\r\nwith a wink, “His Excellency has an eye for feminine beauty—he has.”\r\n\r\nI waited for no more. Struggling into my _shuba_, I crammed my cap on my\r\nhead and hurried to the Palace, only a few hundred yards away. Of the\r\nsentry at the gate I learned that a lady had called upon his Excellency,\r\nand been admitted. After a short conversation with a flunkey, the man\r\npocketed one hundred roubles as a bribe, and I was conducted through the\r\ngreat handsomely-furnished residence of the representative of the Tzar,\r\nand shown into a small anteroom, shut off from another apartment by heavy\r\nplush curtains.\r\n\r\nAs I entered I heard voices in the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n“So you have come, my little one,” a man’s gruff voice exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes—at last,” was the reply. The words were Mariána’s.\r\n\r\nPeeping through the curtains I found I could observe all that went on in\r\nthe luxuriant gaudy apartment. Before the glowing fire a tall, elderly\r\nman, in the white uniform of the Imperial Guard, with his breast covered\r\nwith orders, was standing; and near him Mariána, pale, erect and queenly.\r\n\r\n“I have come, General Korolénko, to free myself from the hateful toils\r\nyou cast about me three years ago, when you were Chief of the Third\r\nSection of Police in Petersburg,” she said, regarding him steadily. “I\r\nwas a Nihilist, and you, taking advantage of my youth and inexperience,\r\ngave me a choice of alternatives. You ordered me to the mines, and then\r\ngave me a chance of regaining my liberty and of saving my brother’s\r\nhonour by becoming one of your contemptible spies. I agreed. For three\r\nyears I have been your puppet. I have acted my ignominious, dishonourable\r\npart in Petersburg society, and been the means of sending dozens of\r\nunoffending persons to their terrible doom—to rot in the dungeons under\r\nthe Neva, or toil in the dark silver mines of the Trans-Baikal—while you,\r\nthe ex-Chief of Secret Police, live here in luxury and pose before your\r\nImperial Master as the great detector of conspiracies!”\r\n\r\n“And what of that?” he cried angrily. “Is my conduct to be criticised by\r\na mere chit of a girl? Remember, you are an agent of the Third Section\r\ncharged with the protection of the person of his Majesty, and as such you\r\nwill remain. If not, recollect you are now in Siberia, and I have merely\r\nto sign this order here and you will go to hard labour at the mines\r\nfor the remainder of your life, where my Cossacks will soon teach you\r\nobedience. So go, jade, and don’t let me hear or see any more of you,”\r\nand he stretched forth his hand to ring the bell.\r\n\r\n“Hear me out!” she cried hoarsely. “I intend to change my despicable mode\r\nof life. I tell you that you must sign this paper releasing me from our\r\nsecret compact and give me complete immunity from arrest,” and she drew a\r\npaper from her breast. “Otherwise I shall take——”\r\n\r\n“Oh! You use threats—eh? Well, my dear, and what can you do, pray?” he\r\nasked with a sneer.\r\n\r\n“Once you held me in your power,” she continued angrily. “Now the tables\r\nare turned. Refuse, and I shall send to his Majesty proofs, together with\r\nthe signed confession, of the miserable coward who in Petersburg one\r\nnight struck Marie Smirnitskaya dead!”\r\n\r\nThe General started, and his face blanched.\r\n\r\n“How—how do you know?” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“The confession is signed by you! Perhaps you forget that we, the\r\nNihilists, tracked you down, compelled you to confess, and spared your\r\nlife in consequence. Besides, have I not had another instance of your\r\nmurderous villainy only last week at Artinsk, where one of your hired\r\nassassins brutally did our driver, Ivan, to death, because he knew the\r\nidentity of the murderer of Marie Smirnitskaya!”\r\n\r\n“You—you lie!” he cried, livid with rage. “You—you would wreck my life,\r\nand bring me to the mines! But, _diable_, you shall not!” he hissed,\r\ndrawing a revolver and advancing towards her. “You—you too shall die!”\r\n\r\nIn a second I parted the curtains and sprang upon him. I was not a moment\r\ntoo soon, for he fired, and the bullet sped over Mariána’s head, smashing\r\none of the great mirrors.\r\n\r\nWrenching the weapon from his grasp, I covered him.\r\n\r\n“The safety of this lady has been entrusted to me, sir,” I said. “I have\r\noverheard all that has transpired, and as soon as you sign the document\r\nwe will withdraw. Until then, we shall remain.”\r\n\r\nHe turned upon me, threatening to have me arrested; but I laughed,\r\ninforming him that I was an official of the Tzar, holding his Majesty’s\r\npersonal passport, therefore he had no power to detain me. For nearly\r\nhalf an hour he endeavoured to evade appending his signature, but at last\r\nhe did so, and we left, Mariána telling him that if she were arrested as\r\na Nihilist her brother would see that his confession was sent immediately\r\nto the Tzar.\r\n\r\n“Who is your brother?” I asked, at last, as we slowly walked together\r\ndown the frozen road.\r\n\r\n“My brother and protector is your friend, Paul Cherniávski,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Paul—your brother!” I cried, half beside myself with delight. “Then I\r\nhave no longer any hesitation in asking you to become my wife.”\r\n\r\nBefore we again entered the bare smoke-blackened post-house she had given\r\nher promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE VELVET PAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Petersburg I had been compelled to part from Mariána Néstoff,\r\nnevertheless she wrote me weekly letters full of tenderness. Six months\r\nafter my return to London an exciting and extraordinary adventure befel\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOne foggy December evening I had entered an empty second-class carriage\r\nat the Temple Station of the Metropolitan District Railway, when I was\r\nfollowed by a tall girl, neatly attired in black, who seated herself\r\nin a corner opposite me. I noticed she was fairly good-looking, about\r\ntwenty years of age, with auburn hair, clear blue eyes, and well-moulded\r\nfeatures; then, after a furtive glance, I took up my newspaper and\r\ncommenced reading.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the train moved off, however, when I felt a light touch upon\r\nmy arm, and heard a musical voice utter my name with true Russian accent.\r\n\r\n“I confess you have the advantage of me,” I said, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Yes, possibly,” she replied, in Russian. “When last we met it was in\r\nPetersburg. But we never spoke.”\r\n\r\n“In Petersburg! You are Russian, then?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded, adding a word by which I knew at once that she was a Nihilist.\r\n\r\n“You are a friend,” she continued earnestly; “Jakovleff has told me so.\r\nMoreover, I have read your articles in the English magazines, in which\r\nyou exposed the vile treachery of the Secret Police, described the prison\r\nhorrors, and told the English public the truth about our oppressed\r\npeople. You have rendered our cause great assistance, and,” she added,\r\nlooking frankly into my face, “I—I wonder whether I, personally, might\r\ncount upon your aid!”\r\n\r\n“What is the nature of your difficulty?” I asked, rather interested.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation, “I expect my brother\r\nto join me at South Kensington. If you will accompany us home, I will\r\nexplain all to you. I am in great peril—how great you cannot imagine.\r\nIndeed, if you refuse your assistance, I shall probably lose my life.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked in consternation. “Is your life threatened?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she cried. “Although we are strangers, nevertheless our common\r\nCause, the freedom of Russia, unites us.” Then, noticing how perplexed\r\nI was over her strangely sensational announcement, she said quickly,\r\n“Pray pardon my omission. I ought to have told you my name—Axinïa\r\nPankrátiévna.”\r\n\r\nBy her manner and conversation I saw she was a political enthusiast,\r\nand suspected that she was in England for some reason connected with\r\nthe operations of the Circle. My curiosity having now been thoroughly\r\naroused, I told her I would do whatever lay in my power to help her.\r\n\r\nOn alighting at South Kensington, we failed to meet her brother as she\r\nexpected; but, notwithstanding the fog, we walked together a considerable\r\ndistance through several quiet thoroughfares, until we came to a large,\r\nold-fashioned house, standing in a square.\r\n\r\nAn elderly man-servant opened the door, and after I had divested myself\r\nof my overcoat I was ushered into a small drawing-room, while my fair\r\nhostess ascended the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe moment I entered the house I experienced a vague feeling of regret\r\nthat I had accepted her invitation. There was something about the place\r\nI did not like. The room was dimly lit by one pink-shaded lamp, the\r\nfurniture had a frowsy, faded appearance, and there was an odour of\r\npastilles that was sickening.\r\n\r\nFor fully ten minutes I had been patiently awaiting the mysterious\r\nAxinïa’s reappearance, when suddenly I experienced a strange dizziness,\r\nand at the same time a terrible pain shot across my forehead.\r\n\r\nA fit of coughing seized me—my breath came and went in short, quick\r\ngasps, and I felt myself choking.\r\n\r\nRising, I walked quickly across the room, and then discovered something\r\nthat increased my suspicions. Everything was thickly coated with dust.\r\nThe place had evidently not been used for years!\r\n\r\nHalting before the fireplace, and glancing at the fire burning clear and\r\nbright, I discovered, to my horror and dismay, that it was of charcoal!\r\n\r\nThen it suddenly dawned upon me that I had been entrapped into a lethal\r\nchamber!\r\n\r\nRushing to the door I tried to open it, but it was securely fastened;\r\nevery crevice had been stopped up from the outside! I went to the window,\r\nbut, on drawing aside the curtains, found that the heavy shutters were\r\nheld in position by a padlocked bar! The chimney, too, had been closed by\r\nan iron plate, which I could not remove.\r\n\r\nI was being asphyxiated!\r\n\r\nStirring the fire, I endeavoured to subdue it, but it only burned more\r\nbrightly! Unable to breathe on account of the poisonous fumes, and\r\nfeeling my strength fast failing, I tied my handkerchief across my mouth\r\nand nose. Then, taking up a heavy fender, I commenced a frantic but\r\nunsuccessful endeavour to batter down the door.\r\n\r\nIn mad despair I rushed from side to side of the apartment, shouting\r\nfor help, but I could hear no sound, and my voice seemed so hollow and\r\nhoarse that I doubted whether it could be heard even outside in the hall.\r\n\r\nThe objects around me were slowly fading from my gaze. Seconds seemed\r\nhours. I remember hearing a sound as if something heavy had fallen in the\r\nroom above. Confused voices whispered about me, and I have a distinct\r\nrecollection of strange, ominous words.\r\n\r\nA heavy weight seemed to press upon my brain; my palsied limbs failed to\r\nsupport me, and I fell backward upon the dust-encrusted carpet.\r\n\r\nThen all became an utter blank.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGradually I regained consciousness. Awakening as if from some terrible\r\nnightmare, I opened my eyes and gazed wonderingly around.\r\n\r\nThe gray light of the wintry dawn showed that the room, small and\r\nunfamiliar, was evidently used for lumber. Half-reclining in an old and\r\nrickety armchair, I felt some cold object in my right hand, and found\r\nit was a revolver, some of the chambers being loaded. My hand, too, was\r\ncovered with blood that had dried.\r\n\r\nStaggering to my feet, and noticing that a half-open door communicated\r\nwith the adjoining apartment, I walked across and entered a small,\r\nshabbily furnished sitting-room. The sight that met my gaze filled me\r\nwith horror and amazement.\r\n\r\nStretched upon the floor lay the woman Axinïa Pankrátiévna.\r\n\r\nI touched the face! Its contact thrilled me; it was icy cold. Around her\r\nwas a pool of blood, and on examination I discovered she had a bullet\r\nwound in the region of the heart, and that the breast of her dress was\r\nsinged, showing that the weapon had been discharged close against her.\r\n\r\nA horrible thought took possession of me. I still held the revolver in my\r\nhand, and blood was upon my fingers! Was not this circumstantial evidence\r\nthat I had been guilty of murder?\r\n\r\nFor several moments I stood in hesitation, my eyes fixed upon the ghastly\r\nface of the corpse. At length I turned, made my way downstairs, and,\r\nafter inspecting the various apartments and finding the place empty,\r\nstole out at the front door.\r\n\r\nSo suspicious were the circumstances in which I had discovered myself\r\nthat I refrained from giving information to the police, and resolved to\r\nkeep my secret and watch the newspapers, in order to see what sensation\r\nwould be caused when the body of my mysterious hostess was discovered.\r\n\r\nHaving noted the number of the house, and ascertained that it was in\r\nOnslow Square, I found my way into Brompton Road, and turned my footsteps\r\nin the direction of Gray’s Inn, where I at that time had chambers.\r\n\r\nOn arrival home I found I had lost my latch-key, and had therefore to\r\nseek the assistance of a locksmith before I could enter. An additional\r\nsurprise was in store for me, for when I walked into my sitting-room,\r\nI discovered that burglars had effected an entrance during the night\r\nand ransacked the place. Every drawer in my writing-table had been\r\nturned out, and the contents investigated in a methodical manner, after\r\nwhich the thieves had apparently inspected a chest of drawers, a nest\r\nof pigeon-holes, several trunks, and one or two cupboards. The carpets\r\nhad been disturbed, and every nook or corner where anything might be\r\nconcealed had been turned out.\r\n\r\nEvidently the thieves had sought for something of value they believed\r\nI had in my possession, and were disappointed; for, as far as I could\r\ndiscover, they had stolen nothing. My first impulse was to send for the\r\npolice, but on reflection I resolved to remain silent on this matter also.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, but no announcement of the discovery of the body\r\nappeared in the papers.\r\n\r\nThere was a possibility of something belonging to me being found in the\r\nhouse by the police. My pockets had been almost emptied on that night;\r\nbut whether the contents had fallen out or been abstracted I was unable\r\nto determine. It was, however, certain that clues to my identity were\r\nnot wanting, and I confess that the fearful suspicion that I was the\r\nactual murderer caused me constant and terrible anxiety. Inquiries\r\nI made regarding the house revealed that it belonged to a well-known\r\nbaronet, who was abroad in the diplomatic service; that it had been to\r\nlet furnished, but that for nearly five years it had remained unoccupied.\r\n\r\nWith the object of recovering anything which might serve as evidence\r\nagainst me, I called upon the house-agent, and, representing myself as a\r\nlikely tenant, obtained the key. The afternoon was wet and gloomy when I\r\nrevisited the place. Being alone, I felt rather unnerved as I ascended\r\nthe wide, old-fashioned stairs to the chamber of death; but when I\r\nentered the inner room I found, to my amazement, that the body was not\r\nthere! It had mysteriously disappeared!\r\n\r\nAll traces of the crime had been carefully obliterated. Even the portion\r\nof threadbare carpet that had been stained with blood had been cut out,\r\nrevealing the dust-covered boards. The other apartments were just as I\r\nhad left them, and in the drawing-room—where, by unknown means, I had\r\nso narrowly escaped death—the ashes of the charcoal still remained. A\r\nstreak of grey light that came in over the top of the shutters enabled me\r\nto inspect the room, and, although I failed to find any of the missing\r\ncontents of my pockets, I saw that the dust that lay thickly upon a\r\nlittle rosewood table had been disturbed. There was a small mark—the\r\nperfect imprint of a woman’s hand.\r\n\r\nAll endeavours to solve the mystery were in vain. I had been the victim\r\nof an extraordinary plot; but the fact of my friendliness towards the\r\nRevolutionists made its object appear the more incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nOne gloomy day I was sitting before the fire in my bachelor den, lazily\r\nenjoying my pipe and a novel, when there came a heavy knock at the outer\r\ndoor, and a boy handed me a telegram.\r\n\r\nTearing it open, I read words that caused me to utter a cry of dismay.\r\nThey were—\r\n\r\n“Mariána Néstoff arrested. She left Petersburg by _étape_ for Siberia\r\nyesterday.—JAKOVLEFF.”\r\n\r\n“Arrested!” I cried aloud. What, I wondered, could be her crime? She\r\nhad evidently fallen into the drag-net of the Russian police as a\r\n“political,” otherwise Jakovleff would not have telegraphed.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the journey on foot thousands of versts beyond the Ourals,\r\nthe privations, the brutality of Cossack escorts, and the terrible\r\nexistence in the mines to which political exiles are doomed, shut out\r\nfrom the light of hope or mercy, all occurred to me. A dozen times I\r\nre-read the telegram, pacing the room in anxiety and despair; then I\r\nresolved to leave that night for Petersburg, obtain a permit to travel in\r\nSiberia, and endeavour to save her. There was no time to be lost, for it\r\nwas already three o’clock and I should be compelled to draw money from\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nMy only thought was of Mariána. How bitterly I regretted having left\r\nher in Russia, and reproached myself for not having warned her against\r\nassociating too closely with those suspected of holding pronounced\r\npolitical views. For myself I cared nothing; being prepared to run any\r\nrisk in order to rescue her from the terrible fate.\r\n\r\nI had taken out a large portmanteau, and was busy thrusting into it some\r\nthings I should require on my journey, when I was startled by another\r\nloud rat-tat. On opening the door a tall, fair-haired woman entered.\r\nShe was well dressed; wearing a small, close-fitting bonnet, and a\r\nfashionable cape trimmed with costly fur. At first I did not recognise\r\nher; but when she had passed through into my sitting-room and lifted her\r\nveil, I saw with astonishment that the young and handsome face was that\r\nof Agraféna Teréshkevna, a wealthy woman whom I had known in Petersburg\r\nas an active member and generous supporter of the Nihilists.\r\n\r\n“It is with much pleasure that I meet you again, m’sieur,” she exclaimed\r\nin Russian, smiling, and extending her hand. “Since you left us I have\r\noften thought of you,” she added, seating herself as if quite at home.\r\nThen, glancing round, she said, “Ugh! What an untidy room! You want a\r\nwife to keep things straight.”\r\n\r\nAlthough I assured her how greatly I appreciated the honour she had\r\ndone me by calling, I was no means pleased at her visit. Though but\r\ntwenty-four years of age, she had already been a widow two years. At\r\ntwenty, in order to secure a set of diamonds and a position, she had\r\nbound herself to an aged merchant king, who, two years later, died\r\nsuddenly of heart disease. After a brief period of mourning she became\r\none of the leaders of fashion in the Russian capital, and the brilliant\r\nentertainments she gave at her great house in the Nevski were attended\r\nby the smartest set. At her _salon_ I was always a welcome guest, and it\r\nwas the remembrance of certain mild flirtations that now caused me some\r\nlittle uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“My rooms are certainly rather untidy,” I said mechanically. “But I am\r\npreparing to start on a long journey.”\r\n\r\n“To where?”\r\n\r\n“To Siberia.”\r\n\r\n“_Dieu!_ Are you going there voluntarily?” she inquired, shuddering.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For what reason?”\r\n\r\n“To seek a dear friend.”\r\n\r\n“A woman, I presume?” she asked, with an ill-disguised sneer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Madame, it is a woman.”\r\n\r\n“And her name is Mariána Néstoff, eh?” she asked slowly, watching my face.\r\n\r\n“You are right. But how did you know?”\r\n\r\n“I heard of her arrest. It is the common talk of Petersburg. The police\r\nmade a raid at one of the meetings, and captured twenty of our comrades.\r\nSome explosives were found in Mariána’s room, and she has been sent to\r\nSredne Kolymsk.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” I cried. “Why, that is beyond the Arctic Circle—the worst\r\nregion in all Siberia!”\r\n\r\nShe nodded, sighing slightly. “It must indeed be a terrible blow to you,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“I—I love her,” I said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I understand. But do not take it to heart so much, Anton,”\r\nshe urged. “Mariána has been unfortunate; but for what reason should you\r\nsacrifice your own liberty? You are known by the police as a Nihilist;\r\ntherefore, if you go to Siberia, you are almost certain to be detained\r\nthere. Besides, even if you found her, you would be unable to secure her\r\nliberty.”\r\n\r\n“No; I must do my best,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Do not run such an unnecessary risk,” she exclaimed, rising suddenly,\r\nand coming behind my chair in an endeavour to console me. “You remember\r\nthat once you told me you cared for me?”\r\n\r\n“What—what do you mean?” I cried wildly.\r\n\r\n“I mean—I mean that I love you, Anton!”\r\n\r\n“Love me!” I stammered, in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said earnestly. “You know how passionately I have loved you,\r\nyet this is the first time I have admitted it. Surely you are not blind?\r\nSince I first saw you I have thought of no other man. It is you—you\r\nonly—that I care for.”\r\n\r\n“But I——”\r\n\r\n“Say the word,” she implored. “Tell me that you will cast aside that\r\npink-and-white, ill-bred doll, whose prettiness is already fading, and\r\nI, Agraféna Teréshkevna, am ready to become your wife as soon as the\r\nmarriage formalities can be arranged.”\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n“Think!” she urged. “I have wealth, position, and—and men say I have\r\nbeauty. I am at your feet. See...!”\r\n\r\nAnd, casting herself upon her knees, she lifted my hand to her lips,\r\ncovering it with passionate kisses.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” I said, withdrawing my hand firmly, “this interview is painful.\r\nThe _tête-à-tête_ we had some months ago amused us; it had a savour\r\nof romance, but I did not dream that you had taken my foolish words\r\nseriously. Let us part, and forget all that has passed between us to-day.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was pale and mute, her hands clenched, her body rigid\r\nas marble. Then, struggling to her feet, she gave vent to a sudden\r\npassionate outburst, tearing the furs from her throat.\r\n\r\n“You cast me aside!” she cried. “You!—who declared your affection for\r\nme—prefer that red-faced, uncouth furrier’s wench! So! We shall see!”\r\n\r\n“Pray calm yourself,” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Calm myself! _Davolno_, Anton Prèhznev! Have I not been befooled? This\r\nlatest idol of yours has gone to Siberia, and you will follow! Good! When\r\nyou are toiling in the gloom of the lead-mines beyond Irkutsk you will\r\nperhaps remember that you forsook the woman who loves you better than her\r\nlife—that she whom you insulted was Agraféna Teréshkevna.”\r\n\r\nWith a momentary glance at the mirror over the mantel-shelf she\r\nrearranged her bonnet. Then, mortified and affronted, she bowed stiffly,\r\nswept past me, and disappeared, slamming the door after her.\r\n\r\nSix weary, anxious weeks passed.\r\n\r\nUnder a grey, lowering sky, a boundless, snow-covered plain stretched far\r\naway into the mist.\r\n\r\nIt was already sixteen days since my driver and myself had left\r\nEkaterinbourg—the last Russian town—and a fortnight since we had gained\r\nthe great Siberian post road. With three horses, which we changed at\r\nthe post-stations, we had travelled almost night and day; yet I did not\r\nexperience fatigue, for the expectation of finding Mariána sustained me.\r\n\r\nSitting back in the sleigh, wrapped in a heavy otter _shuba_, and half\r\nburied under thick rugs, painful thoughts were produced within me by\r\nthe loneliness and gloom as the last rays of the short wintry day were\r\nfading amidst the icy vapours. The snorting of the horses, the jingling\r\nof the bells on the wooden arch over their heads, and the hissing of\r\nthe sleigh-runners, combined to produce a noise that was indescribably\r\nirritating and monotonous.\r\n\r\nI had already visited Tiumen, where there is a great exile-forwarding\r\nprison, through which all persons condemned to banishment, colonisation,\r\nor penal servitude have to pass. On inquiry at the _Prikaz o Silnikh_, or\r\nChief Bureau of Exile Administration, I had learnt that Mariána had left\r\na week before with a convoy of _katorzhniki_ (hard-labour convicts) on\r\nfoot for Tomsk. With the object of overtaking them, I was now travelling\r\nincessantly. The thought that she, innocent of crime, was compelled to\r\nmix with murderers, robbers, and common criminals, sharing the same\r\nfilth, enduring the terrible hardships of the march, and living in the\r\nsame _entourage_ in the vile, fever-infected _étapes_, goaded me almost\r\nto madness.\r\n\r\nIt grew quite dark, and the icy wind blew in fierce, sharp gusts, while\r\nthe snow, which commenced to fall thickly, beat into my face.\r\n\r\n“How far is the next station?” I asked, in Russian, of the driver.\r\n\r\n“Two versts, your High Nobility,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said, “let us hasten. We must remain there to-night, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\nAs I paid him to drive me with all possible speed and without resting,\r\nhe had not grumbled at being compelled to travel during the night, but\r\nmy decision apparently proved gratifying to him, for he whipped up his\r\nhorses, and within half an hour I was thawing myself before the great\r\nstove in the log-built post-house of Abatskaya, distant two thousand\r\nmiles from Petersburg. Early on the following morning we were again on\r\nthe road, continuing throughout the day. In the dull afternoon, soon\r\nafter we had changed horses at Kalmakova, and were speeding across the\r\ngreat undulating plain towards Omsk, the driver turned suddenly, and,\r\npointing with his whip to a distant hill, exclaimed excitedly—\r\n\r\n“See! there they are!”\r\n\r\nJumping to my feet, and straining my eyes eagerly in the direction\r\nindicated, I descried what appeared to be a black, winding streak\r\ndisappearing over the brow of the hill.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, after all, it may be only a train of freight sleighs,” I said.\r\n\r\n“No! I can see the Cossacks’ bayonets,” he replied; for his practised\r\neyes could detect objects on the snow-covered plains where I could see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFor an hour we travelled at increased speed, until we gradually overtook\r\nthe convoy. My thoughts went back to the ever-to-be-remembered days when\r\nI was a “political.” Trudging wearily onward through the deep snow, they\r\nwere a sorry band. The men wore flat caps on their half-shaven heads,\r\nlong grey overcoats with diamond-shaped patches of black or yellow on\r\nthe back, and leg-fetters that filled the air with an ominous clinking.\r\nThe women, too, wore coarse and ragged clothes of grey homespun, with\r\nwoollen squares tied tightly over their heads, while in the rear of the\r\nsad procession were several _telegas_ filled with the sick.\r\n\r\nDriving on past the party, we came up to the captain of the Cossack\r\nescort. Jumping eagerly from the sleigh, I saluted him, telling him whom\r\nI sought, and at the same time handing him an official paper bearing the\r\nseal of the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nOpening it, he shouted an order to halt, and at that moment a ragged,\r\nunkempt-looking woman rushed towards me and flung her arms wildly about\r\nmy neck. So tightly was the kerchief bound over her head for protection\r\nfrom the icy blast, that it was only on second glance that I recognised\r\nMariána. She shed tears of joy.\r\n\r\n“What’s this?” exclaimed the officer, carefully examining the document.\r\n“An order from the Ministry for the immediate release of the convict\r\nMariána Néstoff?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said. “Here are my identification papers.”\r\n\r\n“An order for my release, Anton?” she cried. “How did you obtain it?”\r\n\r\n“It was simple, darling,” I replied, caressing her tenderly. “General\r\nKorolénko now occupies a high position in the Ministry of the Interior\r\nin Petersburg. In exchange for his written confession of the mysterious\r\ndeath of Marie Smirnitskaya I obtained the document by which you are\r\nreleased, and I have brought it personally in order to take you back\r\nagain to civilisation and happiness.”\r\n\r\nWe conversed with the officer for a few minutes. Then he turned to\r\nher and said, “Death is preferable to the life to which you had been\r\nconsigned. You are indeed fortunate to obtain release, and you both have\r\nmy best wishes for your future welfare.”\r\n\r\nWishing me _bon voyage_, he shouted the order to march, and a moment\r\nlater the envious, despairing band of exiles moved slowly onward towards\r\ntheir doom.\r\n\r\nAs we drove back together in the direction of Kalmakova I asked her about\r\nher arrest. What she related astounded me.\r\n\r\n“The spy who denounced me to the police was Madame Teréshkevna. There are\r\nclaws beneath the velvet paw,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Agraféna Teréshkevna!” I cried. “I thought she was a member of the\r\nCircle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But it has since been ascertained that she is also in the pay of\r\nthe Secret Police, and that she gives her brilliant entertainments in\r\norder to seek victims against whom to give information.”\r\n\r\nAs she went on to describe the circumstances of her arrest, and the\r\nhorrors of her imprisonment in the Fortress, I sat silently listening,\r\nand wondering whether I should ever solve the mysteries connected with my\r\nadventure in Onslow Square.\r\n\r\nThe solution came in a curious manner about six months afterwards.\r\nMariána and I, whose marriage was now publicly announced, had taken\r\nup our residence in London, and were frequently the guests of the\r\nRevolutionary refugees. At the house of one of these I met an elderly man\r\nwho was introduced as Ivan Ivanovitch, which was, of course, an assumed\r\nname. It was he who explained the conspiracy against me.\r\n\r\n“The Third Section received orders to suppress you,” he said. “It was\r\nhinted to an _agent provocateur_ that your death would be gratifying, and\r\nAxinïa—who for some time had acted as maid to Agraféna Teréshkevna—aided\r\nby an adventurer named Goltmann, who assumed the part of ‘flunkey,’\r\nformed a plot to kill you. We, however, were determined to frustrate\r\ntheir designs, and, assisted by Paul Maiefski, I kept a close watch upon\r\nthem. We saw the girl Axinïa induce you to go to the house in Onslow\r\nSquare, a key of which she had obtained, and where she had prepared a\r\nvery ingenious death-trap. Madame was in the house at the time, as well\r\nas Goltmann, and the object was first to murder you, and secondly to\r\nsecure the contents of your pockets, which they suspected contained\r\nletters from ‘politicals.’ Soon after you had been admitted Maiefski\r\nand I entered through a window, afterwards unlocking the door of the\r\ndrawing-room and dragging you out of the suffocating fumes. There were\r\nsounds of quarrelling upstairs, and we took you up with us. The high\r\nwords between Madame and her maid prevented us from being heard, and,\r\nleaving you insensible on the landing, we entered the room unobserved.\r\nThe women were quarrelling about you, when Axinïa uttered some insulting\r\nwords to Madame, and the latter, without more ado, drew a revolver from\r\nher pocket and shot the girl dead.\r\n\r\n“It was then we appeared. Madame, startled at finding her crime had been\r\nwitnessed, gave vent to a loud shriek, whereupon Goltmann decamped,\r\ntaking with him your latch-key and a number of letters, including one\r\nfrom Mariána Néstoff, for he had rifled your pockets the moment we had\r\nleft you.”\r\n\r\n“Then that accounts for my rooms being ransacked on that night!” I\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he continued. “The letters and papers were forwarded by Madame to\r\nPetersburg, with the result that Mariána and the others were arrested.\r\nIt was no doubt one of the chief objects of the plot to get Mariána\r\nexiled, because Madame herself loved you; but when she participated in\r\nthe conspiracy she did not intend that you should die, and it was over\r\nthis that the fatal quarrel arose. In order to make you believe you had\r\ncommitted the murder, she placed the revolver in your hand, and on the\r\nfollowing day, fearing detection, she and Goltmann removed the body\r\nsecretly. The whole motive of the plot, it seems, was the fact that she\r\nloved you, and desired to get Mariána out of the way.”\r\n\r\n“And where is Madame now?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“In Brussels. The Executive have sentenced her to death as a spy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the newspapers contained a telegram from Brussels\r\nheaded, “Mysterious Death of a Russian Lady.” It stated that the body of\r\nthe wealthy and beautiful Madame Teréshkevna, of St. Petersburg, had been\r\nfound floating in the Meuse near Namur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDAS-KISS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBah! How I detest tuberoses! Their odour is gruesome. There is death in\r\ntheir breath.\r\n\r\nHow overpowering the scent is! How it clings to the nostrils and stirs\r\nthe memory!\r\n\r\nShall I never be able to forget? Shall I never succeed in drawing the\r\nveil? Tuberoses and—\r\n\r\nPhew! Where did that whiff of chloroform come from? Is it my imagination\r\nplaying me tricks, or is that man at my side a surgeon, fresh from some\r\nmurderous horrible operation? They are all alike, those doctors, licensed\r\nto butcher.\r\n\r\nTuberoses and chloroform! Chloroform and tuberoses! Faugh! they go well\r\ntogether. The grim spectre breathes the one and wears the other.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is remorse. How horrible remorse is! Bearing you down,\r\ngripping you by the throat and strangling you until your brain whirls,\r\nyour senses are dulled, and you see all over again the scenes you desire\r\nmost to forget.\r\n\r\nIt is a couple of years since, yet how fearfully vivid it all is!\r\n\r\nThat pallid face, whiter than the white pillow; the closed eyes, the\r\nashen-brown hair!\r\n\r\nBy Heaven! I see it all before me even now. A hideous reality. The\r\n_dénouement_ of a terrible drama in our struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nMine was a delicate mission. My readers will probably remember that\r\nabout two years ago a new Russian literary and social star appeared in\r\nthe London firmament, in the person of Madame Vera Kovalski. Her sudden\r\nappearance in English society, and her ostentatious parade of wealth\r\naroused our suspicions that she was an agent of the Russian Government,\r\na surmise which was quickly confirmed, for one morning we saw in certain\r\nLondon daily newspapers a long letter signed by her in defence of Russian\r\nbureaucracy, and eulogising the humane Tzar for his paternal interest in\r\nthe millions who called him “father.”\r\n\r\nFrom that day she was the object of vigilant watchfulness. Communications\r\nwith the various Circles in Russia elicited nothing regarding her past,\r\nuntil one day the Executive received a letter from the Kiev centre,\r\ninforming us that the woman who called herself Kovalski was the young\r\nwife of Colonel Paul Krivenko, chief of police of that town. Her husband,\r\nwith his grey-coated myrmidons, had for a long time past endeavoured\r\nto stamp out the revolutionary movement among the students at the\r\nUniversity, but although dozens of innocent persons had been arrested\r\nand sent without trial to Verkhni Udinsk and Yakoutsk, he had, up to the\r\npresent, been unable to discover any members of the Circle proper.\r\n\r\nHis wife had earned an unenviable reputation by giving information which\r\nled to the arrest of a dozen unfortunate students, who were brought\r\nbefore the special court at Petersburg. Evidently fearing to return to\r\nKiev, she had afterwards mysteriously disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe portrait—taken from a lady’s newspaper—which we had sent, had been\r\nidentified, and the communication warned us that she was in England for\r\nthe purpose of espionage.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances in which I was entrusted with the discovery\r\nof her object in visiting London, and the extent of her knowledge of our\r\nmovements. Matters were again ripe for a further attempt to overthrow\r\nthe Imperial power, and the Executive had in preparation an elaborate\r\nand desperate plot which seemed likely to be as successful as that\r\nwhich—unfortunately for Russia—removed Alexander II.; providing the\r\nastute members of the “Third Section” could be baffled and led upon a\r\nwrong scent. It was highly desirable that we should know what Madame\r\nVera was really doing, and with whom she was in communication in Russia;\r\ntherefore it devolved upon me to watch her.\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals signed articles and letters from her pen were\r\nappearing in the press in defence of the Imperial Autocrat, and\r\nendeavouring to prove, by relating personal narratives, that the prison\r\nhorrors of Siberia as revealed by George Kennan and other travellers\r\nexisted merely in the imagination. She even went so far as to assert that\r\n“the condition of the much-talked-of forwarding prison at Tomsk would do\r\ncredit to any London hospital.”\r\n\r\nThis paid defender of Russian tyranny was but one of a number, each of\r\nwhom has flourished in London society for a season or so and disappeared\r\nas mysteriously as they came. Some have succeeded in performing the\r\nsecret services for which they were sent out from Petersburg, while upon\r\nothers has fallen a relentless vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn order that my connection with the revolutionist colony in Oakleigh\r\nGardens should not be discovered, I never visited them there. We had\r\nanother place of meeting when I desired a conference. Indeed, I had found\r\nit necessary to remove my quarters from Shaftesbury Avenue to Dane’s\r\nInn, that queer grimy abode of bachelors situate off Wych Street—the\r\noldest and quaintest thoroughfare in London—under the shadow of the Law\r\nCourts. There, in chambers, I led the rollicking life of a Bohemian of\r\nindependent means, had artists, authors, and actors, for my friends, and\r\nwas known to them as Pierre Delorme. Speaking French fluently, I had no\r\ndifficulty in disguising my nationality, and assuming the _rôle_ of a\r\nsubject of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Rectory of the sleepy little Northamptonshire village of\r\nKingsthorpe was a spacious old Jacobean house, hidden by ivy, with\r\nred, lichen-covered roofs, tall chimneys, and diamond-paned, mullioned\r\nwindows. Standing back from the broad, white highway, a large,\r\nold-fashioned, flower-garden lay in front, while at the rear an orchard\r\nand well-kept lawn sloped down to the picturesque river Nene. The\r\nReverend George Farrar, the rector, was a rubicund, happy-looking man,\r\na true type of the port-drinking, fox-hunting British parson, and with\r\nhis wife and two handsome daughters, was popular with all throughout\r\nhis rural parish, from the Earl at the Hall down to the most humble and\r\nimpecunious cottager. Though he hunted with the Fitzwilliam Pack, and\r\ncould handle a cue with dexterity acquired by long practice, nevertheless\r\nthere was no cant about him, and he was both pious and charitable.\r\n\r\nIt was at Kingsthorpe that Madame Kovalski was visiting during August,\r\nshe having met the Farrars frequently in London and dispensed to them\r\nthe hospitality of her house in Lexham Gardens, Kensington. By dint of a\r\nlittle artful manœuvring and the exertions of a mutual friend, I also had\r\ncontrived to make the acquaintance of the warm-hearted old rector, and\r\nhad responded to his cordial invitation to spend a fortnight at “Sleepy\r\nHollow,” as he called it.\r\n\r\nThere were several other guests, but my attention was devoted to Madame\r\nVera, with whom I very soon became on terms of pleasant friendship.\r\n\r\nWe were idling away one hot afternoon together in a punt up a romantic\r\nand picturesque backwater of the Nene. Behind us the ground rose, covered\r\nthickly with beeches and hawthorn. A small weir, with a few eel baskets\r\nof brown osier, closed in the creek. The water was still, and around us\r\nmasses of white water-lily studded the surface with silver stars. Beneath\r\nthe deep emerald leaves, perch and dace darted from time to time, or\r\nlazily sucked in some drowning moth or wandering fly.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was stifling in the sun, yet beneath the protecting willow\r\nto which I had chained the punt there was a pleasant soothing breeze that\r\nkept the gnats away and made the afternoon quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nVera looked ravishing. I had no idea that the woman upon whom I had to\r\nkeep observation was so young and beautiful. Her broad white hat, set\r\nback on her shapely head, threw out her copper hair and deep-blue eyes.\r\nThe olive silk that clung round her firm shoulders and waist outlined\r\nthe broad curve of her limbs and fell in soft draperies about her little\r\nfeet. The lace sleeves through which her white arms showed were a pretty\r\nidea, but far too tempting for a bachelor. I had found her not averse to\r\nflirtation, otherwise I should not have spoken as I did.\r\n\r\n“Vera, you are a pretty woman!” I said; “yours are the longest\r\neye-lashes, I think, I ever saw! Your complexion is simply faultless,\r\nwhile the crisp little curls of brown around your forehead take a copper\r\nhue in the warm sun I have never yet seen out of Titian.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you flatter me so?” she asked, laughing and puckering up her rosy\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nShe was lolling upon the cushions at the end of the punt, having flung\r\ndown her novel heedlessly.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I may be permitted to admire you,” I said, smiling. “Parisians\r\nare connoisseurs of beauty. You do not want to read? Then talk to me.\r\nShall I tell you your voice is as sweet as a carillon of silvery chimes?\r\nThat your presence is as graceful and bewitching as the vision of an\r\nhouri? Well, I won’t be idiotic, but as sensible as a man can be when he\r\nhas for companion the most charming woman in England.”\r\n\r\n“How ridiculously you talk!” she exclaimed, with a merry mischievous\r\nsmile. “Remember, I’ve been married two years—and my husband—I——”\r\n\r\n“You are not devoted to him, Vera.”\r\n\r\n“How—how did you know?” she asked, starting. “Who told you?”\r\n\r\n“No one. But why deny it?”\r\n\r\n“I do not deny it. Indeed, I have tried to be good to him, Pierre, but he\r\nis almost double my age; so cold, so careless, and I hear so many awful\r\nstories of his dissipated habits that it is quite impossible to love him.\r\nWe are, therefore, best apart.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Vera! I fear your life is not a happy one if we knew all.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no, alas!” she sighed. “I’ll tell you something of it and you can\r\njudge, Pierre. Indeed, I am lonely and wretched.”\r\n\r\nShe did not speak for some minutes; but her head changed its position\r\nfrom the cushion where it lay, and by some aberration of mind rested\r\nitself lightly upon my shoulder. There was really no harm. She did not\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nThere was such a sweet odour of stephanotis wafted across my senses that\r\nI looked at the copper halo on my arm and wondered if it was not some\r\nrare orchid or tropical moss that had fallen there. She had turned her\r\nhead away, and her hand was playing with the water-lily leaves waving\r\ngently in the stream.\r\n\r\nHer skin was like alabaster. Little curls formed arabesques over the\r\nnape of her neck; and her ear, pink and transparent, tempted me to\r\nwhisper into it words of passionate love. There is no situation in the\r\nhuman drama so interesting as a _tête-à-tête_ with a pretty woman; and\r\nwhen that woman is married, with a grievance against her husband, the\r\n_tête-à-tête_ is all the more attractive.\r\n\r\nShe told me a sad story, how she had been forced to marry Colonel\r\nKovalski, but she did not mention that his real name was Krivenko, or\r\nthat he was an officer of Imperial Police. She merely told me that he\r\nheld an important official position, and that, having discovered his\r\nunfaithfulness, she had left him and come to England, where she had no\r\nenemies to gloat over her unhappiness.\r\n\r\nA tear stole down her cheek as she related her narrative, and a sob\r\nescaped her.\r\n\r\n“Do not think of it, Vera,” I said, endeavouring to console her. “Think\r\nof the charming afternoon. Look at that gorgeous butterfly that hovers\r\nover the stream; look at its wings, now brown, now purple, with its\r\norange tips and blue eyes, staring like Psyche at her discovered Cupid.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” she replied, with a heavy sigh; “but you, a Frenchman, cannot\r\nunderstand one’s social position in Russia.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” I exclaimed with sudden interest; “I have heard and read so\r\nmuch of Nihilism that my curiosity has been aroused, and I’m always eager\r\nto improve my knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“Nihilism!” she repeated in surprise. “Why do you ask me about it? How\r\ncan I know anything about conspirators?”\r\n\r\n“But every Russian has a knowledge of the Terrorists.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are everywhere,” she admitted. “And, indeed, I don’t wonder.\r\nWrong a man, deny him all redress, exile him if he complains, gag him if\r\nhe cries out, strike him in the face if he struggles, and at last he will\r\nstab and throw bombs. In the light of facts recently brought to light,\r\nTerrorism ceases to be an unnatural or inexplicable phenomenon. Our\r\nGovernment manufactures murderers.”\r\n\r\n“Are you, then, in favour of the Revolutionists?” I asked, greatly\r\nsurprised at this expression of opinion in such direct contrast to the\r\nviews set forth in her various articles.\r\n\r\n“A Russian never dares to publicly express his or her political\r\nconvictions. As for me—well, I have ceased to trouble my head about them.\r\nIn a sense, I am an exile.”\r\n\r\nWhat an admirable actress she was; yet how charming! I had not been\r\nthinking of her as an accomplished spy, but as a woman who yearned\r\nfor sympathy and affection. As the sun declined, the river grew more\r\ntranquil, and the cawing of the rooks, as they went to bed, told that day\r\nwas drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nShe offered me a cigarette from her case, and taking one herself,\r\nlit them both with the air of an inveterate smoker. What could be\r\nmore delicious? A balmy breeze, full of the odour of meadow-sweet, a\r\nbewitching woman by one’s side, with nothing absolutely to do but admire\r\nher eyes and lips, while she discoursed with logical clearness upon the\r\nstruggle of the Russian people against the iron rule of the Great White\r\nTzar.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard of your articles,” I said, after she had been describing\r\nincidents in connection with the expulsion of the Jews from Odessa.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I write sometimes,” she replied. “It is a pleasant and profitable\r\namusement; yet one does not always express one’s real political opinions\r\nwhen writing for the press.” And she laughed lightly. “Had you lived in\r\nRussia you would recognise the extreme danger of commenting adversely\r\nupon the Government or criticising its administrative exile system.”\r\n\r\nOur conversation was interrupted by the clock of Kingsthorpe Church\r\nstriking six. Half-past was the dinner hour at the Rectory, therefore I\r\nunloosened the moorings, and, taking up the pole, pushed the punt lazily\r\nhomeward, chatting to my fair freight, expressing the enjoyment her\r\ncompanionship afforded me, and amusing her with tittle-tattle until we\r\nstepped ashore on the Rectory lawn.\r\n\r\nBut before we had left our secluded little backwater I had kissed her,\r\nand in return received a fierce and fond caress.\r\n\r\nI had imprinted a Judas-kiss upon her lips!\r\n\r\nNext morning at breakfast I was sitting beside her. We had just finished\r\nthe meal when the servant entered with letters. Beside her plate the maid\r\nplaced two missives, one a tiny note with a superscription in a feminine\r\nhand; but the appearance of the other was a revelation to me. It lay\r\nfor a moment unheeded, and by a quick, sidelong glance I saw that the\r\nlarge, square envelope bore the official frank stamp and double-headed\r\neagle of the Ministry of the Interior at Petersburg. When she noticed\r\nit she hurriedly folded it in half and thrust it into her pocket without\r\nexamining its contents.\r\n\r\nThat evening, when we joined the ladies in the drawing-room after dinner,\r\nI noticed she was not with them. Leaving the room, I inquired of one of\r\nthe maids, and learnt that the fair diplomat, wearing her cloak and hat,\r\nhad been seen to cross the lawn in the direction of the river’s bank.\r\n\r\nSome influence impelled me to follow. The summer’s night was still and\r\nstarlight; scarcely a leaf stirred, and the quiet was only broken by\r\nthe distant rushing of the weir. Passing out by a gate at the side of\r\nthe lawn, I walked along a by-path that ran through the meadows by the\r\nwater’s edge. Large alders grew beside the stream, and in their shadow I\r\nadvanced noiselessly over the grass.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard voices, and halted to listen. I recognised hers! She was\r\nspeaking in Russian.\r\n\r\n“Tell me. What’s to be done?” she was asking.\r\n\r\n“Act as before,” replied a man’s voice in the same language. “You\r\nreceived your instructions from the Ministry to-day.”\r\n\r\n“They might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have already\r\ncompleted my investigations.”\r\n\r\n“You have!” cried the man. “What is the plot? Explain it to me.”\r\n\r\n“I have not yet made out my report,” she replied coldly. “Besides, I am\r\nin the employ of the Ministry, not in yours.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear Madame, pardon me if I have given offence. It was out of\r\nsheer curiosity that I asked.”\r\n\r\n“Curiosity of a kind that would ruin me, eh? You would sell the secret\r\nto General Gresser, and claim the reward; but I am as wary as yourself,\r\nm’sieur.”\r\n\r\n“I beg Madame’s pardon—she speaks too harshly. Indeed, your secret would\r\nbe quite safe——”\r\n\r\n“As safe as when, by your devilish ingenuity, you learnt of the\r\nconspiracy I had unearthed in Paris, and telegraphed it in detail to\r\nPetersburg as the result of your own vigilance. On that occasion who was\r\nrewarded?—who was decorated by the Emperor? Why, you! As for me, I——”\r\n\r\n“But you are my wife. What does it matter?”\r\n\r\n“Wife—bah!” she replied, in intense disgust. “We have parted, and you\r\nhave no claim whatever upon me. By what right, pray, have you followed\r\nme here? Cannot I carry out this hateful work without your detestable\r\ncompanionship?”\r\n\r\n“But I assist you,” he urged. “Besides, I—I sometimes think, Vera, that\r\nwe might accomplish much better work if we combined our efforts.”\r\n\r\n“With you—never,” she replied angrily. “It is true that I married you,\r\nbut we have never lived together—and never shall.”\r\n\r\n“Do you forget that I once saved you from death?”\r\n\r\n“Was not that a husband’s duty?” she asked, adding, “I cannot stay\r\nlonger; my hostess will miss me.”\r\n\r\n“But you shall remain and hear my proposal. I intend that you shall\r\nreturn to Russia, and live with me.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Then I may at once tell you, Paul Krivenko, that I hate you;\r\nthat I would rather die than be your cat’s-paw,” and she laughed\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n“You!—you speak like that to me!” he cried in rage. “I—I’ll kill you!”\r\n\r\n“Bah! do your worst,” she exclaimed defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Not another word,” he hissed, adding a foul oath. “You’ll explain the\r\nwhole of this conspiracy you have discovered, or—or I’ll wring your white\r\nneck, and fling you into the river here. Now, you have your choice.”\r\n\r\nThere were sounds of a scuffle, and I heard Vera cry hoarsely, “Let me\r\ngo! You hurt my throat—you coward! Help, for God’s sake!”\r\n\r\nCreeping from my hiding-place, I peered round the clump of hawthorns,\r\nand in the faint light beheld Madame struggling with her husband. He\r\nwas about fifty years of age, foppishly dressed, and wore his moustache\r\nwaxed. I could discern that his eyes were unusually close together, his\r\nfeatures were small, except his mouth, which was wide, his lips thin, the\r\neffect being vulpine. By repute I knew Colonel Krivenko as one of the\r\nmost cunning bloodhounds connected with the “Third Section.” He was a\r\nmaster of his craft, and, characteristic of the mercenary spy all over\r\nthe world, he was true to nobody, not even to his employers, not even\r\nto his hatreds, for he had accepted service both for and against the\r\nNihilists, both for and against his Imperial Master, the Tzar.\r\n\r\nI saw he was bending over his young wife. He had clutched her by the\r\nthroat, and was forcing her upon her knees, at the same time uttering\r\nterrible imprecations, and demanding to be informed of the result of her\r\nsecret investigations.\r\n\r\nJust as I had turned, intending to retreat to my place of concealment,\r\nhaving gained knowledge that would put the Executive on its guard, I\r\nheard Krivenko give vent to a fierce guttural oath.\r\n\r\nThen a woman’s shrill cry rang out in the still air, followed by a great\r\nsplash.\r\n\r\nReturning quickly, I looked cautiously behind the bush, but neither\r\nthe man nor woman were there. Upon the surface of the water were great\r\neddying rings, momentarily growing larger, plainly showing that the dark\r\nstream had closed over some heavy body. I gazed for a few moments at the\r\ncircling rings, not knowing how to act. Nothing appeared on the surface,\r\nand the waters gradually resumed their tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThen I searched the bank, behind trees and bushes, and in every nook, but\r\ncould discover no one.\r\n\r\nShuddering, I retraced my steps to the Rectory, and joined the ladies in\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\nDays passed, but Vera Kovalski did not return. Her mysterious\r\ndisappearance caused a great sensation in Kingsthorpe and the\r\nneighbourhood. Although telegrams were despatched in all directions, no\r\ntidings could be gleaned of her. The strange affair cast a gloom over\r\nthe usually merry household, for every one appeared to have forebodings\r\nthat some unknown catastrophe had occurred, and the guests, feeling the\r\nsolemnity irksome, departed, an example I quickly followed.\r\n\r\nBefore I left the Rectory, however, I examined the whole of Madame’s\r\nbelongings, in the hope of finding something which might serve as a clue\r\nto the discovery of the “conspiracy” about which she had spoken. But the\r\nsearch was futile.\r\n\r\nOn returning to London I informed the Executive of the occurrence, a\r\ncouncil was held, at which it was decided that every agency possessed by\r\nour Party should be requisitioned, in order to discover whether either\r\nColonel Krivenko or his wife were really still alive. For the success of\r\nour plot—which was a bold venture, involving the partial destruction of\r\nthe Castle of Schlusselburg and the release of the political prisoners\r\nconfined there—it was of supreme importance that we should know if Madame\r\nKovalski still lived, and if so, the extent of her knowledge.\r\n\r\nDescriptions and photographs, circulated among our members, both in\r\nEngland and on the Continent, failed to elicit any clue.\r\n\r\nWith Dmitri Irteneff as companion, I was ever vigilant in the London\r\nstreets for many weeks, hoping to meet her, while Grinevitch continually\r\nkept Madame’s house in Lexham Gardens, Kensington, under observation. We\r\nhave such a perfect method of tracing those who incur our displeasure\r\nthat, when once the order is issued by the Executive, escape is hopeless.\r\n\r\nColonel Krivenko’s body had already been found floating in the Nene\r\nnear Peterborough, and having satisfied ourselves that his wife had not\r\nreturned to her friends in London, we directed our attention to other\r\nquarters, and continued our search through many weeks.\r\n\r\nA heavy, thick mist was blowing on the gale which swept fiercely in gusts\r\ndown the English Channel. The yellow light of the November afternoon had\r\nalready begun to dwindle. No sun had shone on the dreary Sussex coast\r\nthat day. The tide was out, and the wide, wet sands stretched from the\r\ncliffs to the selvage of white foam that flickered in the grey light far\r\noff, where the waves broke in hissing spray.\r\n\r\nIn this tempestuous afternoon Irteneff and I were walking along the top\r\nof the cliffs between Eastbourne and Beachy Head. Suddenly, as we rounded\r\na point, we saw below a single human being on the level foreshore. At\r\nfirst it was merely a speck, traversing the sand along the margin of\r\nthe wind-whitened sea. We waited for its approach, and as it drew nearer\r\nDmitri took a small binocular from his pocket. Having focused it upon the\r\nmoving object, he quickly handed it to me, exclaiming briefly—\r\n\r\n“At last! We have found her!”\r\n\r\nI looked eagerly, and saw the form of a woman walking with her head bent\r\nagainst the roaring wind. I recognised the figure and gait as that of\r\nVera Kovalski!\r\n\r\nAs she moved along towards Eastbourne, we retraced our steps, and\r\nfollowed her to the Queen’s Hotel, where Irteneff, on inquiry, found she\r\nhad been staying for nearly a month under the name of Mrs. Axford, and\r\nalso that on several occasions gentlemen had called upon her.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later I had transferred my abode from the Cavendish to the\r\nQueen’s, and having duly installed myself in a room in the same corridor\r\nas Madame, I resolved to act promptly.\r\n\r\nI did not go down to dinner, but waited till she returned. I heard her\r\nclose her door; then placing a small phial in my vest pocket, and taking\r\na clean handkerchief from my bag, stole along the corridor and entered\r\nher sitting-room without knocking.\r\n\r\nShe had flung herself upon a couch, but started up on my entrance.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear Madame,” I commenced, as I closed the door behind me. “So I\r\nhave found you at last!”\r\n\r\n“Found me!” she cried in alarm, springing to her feet. “What do you mean\r\nby entering my room in this manner? I know who you are—that your real\r\nname is Anton Prèhznev, and that you are a Nihilist. I’ll ring for the\r\nservants!”\r\n\r\nAnd she made a dash forward. I was compelled to act without hesitation.\r\n\r\n“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” I said, determinedly. As I uttered\r\nthe words I took out the tiny phial and emptied the contents upon the\r\nhandkerchief, which a moment later I held firmly over her nose and mouth.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds, and with only a long sigh, she fell back into my arms,\r\nan inert and helpless burden.\r\n\r\nPlacing her upon the couch, I entered her bedroom and searched her trunk\r\nand dressing-case. In the latter I discovered some letters from the\r\nMinistry of the Interior and some photographs, all of which I crushed\r\ninto my pockets. While doing so, a thought crossed my mind that she would\r\nprobably conceal about her person the more important documents.\r\n\r\nWhen I re-entered the sitting-room she was lying just as I had left her.\r\nI placed my hand in the bodice of her gown, and as I did so a spray of\r\ntuberoses fell to the floor. Feeling crisp paper inside her bodice, I\r\ndrew it forth. It was an envelope, the contents of which I immediately\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nI discovered that it was the report for which I had been searching.\r\nBreathless with excitement, I read it through from beginning to end. Our\r\nplot was completely exposed! Moreover, it gave names and descriptions of\r\nthe Executive and prominent members resident in London, myself included.\r\n\r\nWhen I had devoured the contents, I placed it carefully in my pocket,\r\nafterwards turning to cast a farewell glance at her. With alarm I noticed\r\nthat in the few minutes during which I had been reading an ashen pallor\r\nhad overspread her countenance. I laid my hand softly upon her breast.\r\n\r\nThe heart had ceased to beat! Then the terrible truth dawned upon me. I\r\nhad administered an overdose! Vera Kovalski was dead, and I had murdered\r\nher!\r\n\r\nFor a moment my senses reeled, so overcome was I by the mingled odours\r\nof chloroform and tuberoses. But I managed to recover myself and creep\r\nnoiselessly out.\r\n\r\nIs there any wonder why I have never since been able to endure the\r\ncombined sickly scents of chloroform and tuberoses.\r\n\r\nI can smell them now! Faugh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAN IMPERIAL SUGAR PLUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incident at Borki, when the train in which the Tzar Alexander and\r\nTzarina were travelling was wrecked and partially burned, will no doubt\r\nbe remembered by the majority of readers. Although generally attributed\r\nto a Nihilist plot, the perpetrators of the outrage have never been\r\ndiscovered. It is true that thirty-seven persons of both sexes were\r\narrested at Kirsanoff and Atkarsk and sent to the Kadainski silver mine\r\nin Eastern Siberia as a “precautionary measure,” but all were innocent,\r\nand notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of the Russian “Security\r\nSection,” aided by the police of the whole of Europe, the matter has\r\nalways been regarded as a mystery.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, I have resolved to explain the manner in which\r\nthat attempt was made, the cause of its failure, and the means employed\r\nby the conspirators to effect their escape.\r\n\r\nForeign critics—those in the pay of the Russian Government—frequently\r\nstigmatise Nihilists as frenzied enthusiasts who seek to reform society\r\nand reconstitute their country by the aid of dynamite and bombshells.\r\nNevertheless, although the means employed may, perhaps, appear\r\nreprehensible, yet the majority of patriotic Englishmen are in sympathy\r\nwith the cause of Russian freedom. Have we not had many examples thrust\r\nupon us of the tyranny and callousness of the late Tzar? When the Lord\r\nMayor, representing the City of London, petitioned his Imperial Majesty\r\nregarding the inhuman treatment of Jews, what answer did he receive? The\r\nrepresentative of English liberty was snubbed; the petition was returned\r\nwith a curt reply that Russian Jews did not concern the Lord Mayor. Such\r\nan illustration of Muscovite despotism should be borne in mind by those\r\nwho look upon Nihilists as murderers.\r\n\r\nOur object is to free our beloved country from the terrible yoke. In the\r\ngreat sorrow-stricken land, tens of thousands of our countrymen groan\r\nbeneath the curse of infamous laws and the burden of unjust taxation.\r\nThe young Tzar on his throne is powerless, his myrmidons who surround\r\nhim keep their grip upon the desolated country, and no man can breathe\r\nwith absolute freedom. The police are infamous spies who will sell a\r\nman’s life for a few kopecks; the magistracy is corrupt, and justice a\r\nburlesque. Poverty, misery, and starvation are rampant, and happiness\r\nis unknown, beneath the crushing weight of this monstrous form of\r\ndespotism. The so-called Nihilists desire to free their country from this\r\ncurse, and would do it by peaceable means, and without bloodshed, were it\r\npossible. But it is not, and therefore the Executive are compelled to be\r\nmerciless, and are determined to strike enemies of Russia without pity or\r\nremorse.\r\n\r\nTo sweep the Autocrat from his throne, to break his power, to destroy\r\nthe corrupt ministers and infamous advisers by whom he is surrounded,\r\nto bring enlightenment, peace, and freedom to millions of honest,\r\nGod-fearing men, women, and children in Russia, are the objects and aims\r\nof those who are so frequently designated as murderers.\r\n\r\nYet the work goes on, silently, steadily, deadly. Each day brings the\r\npower of the Tzar’s nearer its disastrous termination; each day increases\r\nthe hopes of those thousands of “political suspects” buried alive in\r\nSiberian snow-drifts; each night brings us nearer the dawn of a bright\r\nand prosperous day.\r\n\r\nAlready my readers have learnt the reason I, Anton Prèhznev, loyal\r\nsoldier of his Imperial Majesty, became transformed into a revolutionist.\r\nMy case is but one of many thousands. In Russia, one must be either a\r\nflunkey or a Nihilist, and most persons prefer to work for the cause of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nIt was in a small room over a dingy and uninviting-looking _café_ in\r\nGerrard Street, Soho—to which our headquarters had been transferred, in\r\norder to elude the vigilance of the spies of the Embassy—that there was\r\narranged one of the most bold and terrible plots since the assassination\r\nof Alexander II.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held hurriedly at midnight, and I attended. Paul\r\nPétroff—who had that day returned from Petersburg—presided, and\r\nTersinski, Irteneff, Grinevitch, and Bounakoff were present.\r\n\r\n“Brothers,” exclaimed Pétroff, after we had seated ourselves and\r\ntransacted some preliminary business, “our time has arrived. By the\r\nexercise of due caution we shall be enabled to strike a blow that will\r\nparalyse Europe, and remove the Tyrant and his underlings. Shall we do\r\nso?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” we replied, with one accord.\r\n\r\n“Now that the lips of that traitress, Vera Kovalski, are sealed, we are\r\nfree to act,” he continued. “The _Zemliá i Vólia_ (”Land and Liberty“)\r\ngroup in Petersburg have supplied us with information. The Tzar and\r\nTzarina will leave the Winter Palace this day fortnight for Astrakhan.”\r\n\r\nHe took from the papers at his elbow a large map of Russia, upon which\r\nwas marked in red the route by which the Imperial party were to travel.\r\nIt showed that they would go by way of Moscow, Riazan, Tambov, Atkarsk,\r\nto Saratov, and thence by steamer down the Volga.\r\n\r\n“You observe, brothers,” he said, “the train will pass over several\r\nunimportant branch lines. It is suggested by the Circle in Petersburg\r\nthat a disaster should occur on one of these, as they will not be so\r\nclosely watched as the trunk lines.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of a disaster?” I asked.\r\n\r\nPétroff ran his fingers through his long, dark hair, and fixed his\r\nsearching eyes upon me.\r\n\r\n“We have yet to decide,” he replied. “Besides, as it would be extremely\r\ndangerous for any member of the Petersburg group to undertake the\r\nattempt, one of us will be compelled to put the plans into execution,\r\nreceiving assistance, of course, from our brothers in the capital.”\r\n\r\n“There are many ways of causing a disaster,” observed Tersinski. “A\r\ncharge of dynamite under the metals, as at Moscow, might prove effective.”\r\n\r\n“Or destroy a bridge, as we did at Elizabethgrad,” suggested Bounakoff.\r\n\r\n“And wreck the pilot engine only,” remarked the President. “No, neither\r\nwill do. The only way it can be done effectually is from the train\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\n“But how?” asked Grinevitch, who had been sitting thoughtful and silent.\r\n\r\nPétroff then entered into a minute explanation, producing plans of the\r\nvarious lines that he had brought from Petersburg, together with a sketch\r\nof the Imperial train, and a list of the suite and ministers who would,\r\nin all probability, travel by it. We sat together until the small hours\r\nof the morning, and at length arranged every detail.\r\n\r\nThen came the momentous question as to who should be deputed to carry\r\nout the project. It was at first suggested that Grinevitch should be\r\nentrusted with the mission, but eventually we decided to cast lots as\r\nusual. We threw dice, and Fate decreed that the choice should fall upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA September night. The rain was falling at intervals from bars of\r\nragged, fleecy cloud, and the lights of Petersburg cast long, uncertain\r\nreflections upon the bosom of the dark Neva. The clock of the Izaak\r\nChurch had long ago struck the hour of one; the theatres were emptied,\r\nand the last _café_ had been closed.\r\n\r\nThe rain plashed gloomily upon the pavement of the Nevski Prospekt as I\r\ntrudged onward. I was making my way to friends who would assist me in my\r\nmission. Only half an hour before I had arrived from England, but I was\r\nno stranger to the city, although some years had elapsed since I had last\r\nwalked its broad streets.\r\n\r\nAlready the rain had soaked through my thick travelling ulster, my teeth\r\nwere chattering, my limbs ached from being cooped up in a close railway\r\ncarriage for five days, and I felt generally depressed and uncomfortable.\r\nAs I was passing the Hôtel de l’Europe my attention was arrested by the\r\nquick passage of a figure through the light shed by a street lamp—a\r\nshort man, whose head was sunk between his shoulders, with sharp features\r\nand small keen eyes—who glanced sharply at me and passed rapidly on.\r\n\r\nI thought nothing of the occurrence at the time, because I was fearless.\r\nMy passport was perfectly legitimate, stating that my name was\r\nAlexandrovitch Charushin, Russian subject, born at Odessa, and living\r\nin Munich; that my calling was that of _chef_, and, further, that I had\r\nreturned to Petersburg in search of employment. So completely was I\r\ndisguised by the removal of my beard and moustache, and the application\r\nof theatrical “make up,” that even the spies of the London division of\r\nthe Secret Police would pass me by unnoticed. Therefore I felt confident\r\nof security.\r\n\r\nPresently I turned from the Nevski into a dingy by-street, and having\r\nwalked through to the farther end, halted before a confectioner’s, and\r\nrang the private bell.\r\n\r\nMy handbag was heavy, and I set it down until I should be admitted.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the door opened mysteriously, and on my entrance was\r\nquickly closed again, leaving me in darkness.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, friend, to Petersburg,” said a man’s voice in a low tone. “Walk\r\nforward, and upstairs.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and on gaining the landing entered a small sitting-room. The\r\ntwo occupants—a man and a woman—rose to greet me.\r\n\r\n“At last,” exclaimed the young fellow, who subsequently introduced\r\nhimself as Ivan Liustig, medical student. “You must be hungry. Mascha,\r\nhere, will get you something to eat.”\r\n\r\nI turned to glance at his companion. Our eyes met. Our voices mingled in\r\na cry of joy. I had at last found my sister Mascha!\r\n\r\nIn the hour that followed we both related briefly our adventures. She had\r\ngrown older, more matronly, yet still more beautiful than when I had last\r\nseen her writhing under the terrible torture of the knout in the open\r\nmarket-place of Mstislavl. As I felt the soothing touch of her hands, and\r\nlooked into the deep-blue eyes, I saw fathomed there a wealth of love,\r\nand patience, and pity.\r\n\r\nSitting at table with Liustig and Boris Soliviof—the proprietor of the\r\nconfectioner’s shop, who had admitted me—I watched Mascha’s face as she\r\nchatted and drew tea from the shining samovar. In repose, its expression\r\nwas one of infinite gentleness; yet in a moment, at a word regarding the\r\nrevolutionary movement, it would change: the rosy, child-like lips would\r\nmeet, the fair cheeks glow, the delicate nostrils dilate, and the eyes\r\nwould flame with an enthusiasm begotten of wrong and long suffering.\r\n\r\nShe described to me her life since that day when we last met at\r\nMstislavl; how she had been kept in prison for three years, two of which\r\nwere spent in the Fortress of Peter and Paul, merely because she was\r\nsuspected of political enthusiasm. She was never brought to trial; but,\r\nafter the long years of solitude in damp, mouldy cells, during which\r\nher health was shattered, she contracted typhoid fever, and was set\r\nat liberty. Since that time she had allied herself with the _Zemliá i\r\nVólia_, and had been considered one of the most daring members of the\r\ngroup. She earned her living by fur-sewing, and was engaged to be married\r\nto Ivan Liustig.\r\n\r\nMy real name had never transpired in connection with the work of the\r\nExecutive, therefore she had all these years believed that I was still in\r\nexile in Siberia, where she had heard our father had died while chained\r\nto his wheel-barrow in the Nerchinsk mine.\r\n\r\nI was relating how I escaped, when the opening of the street-door by a\r\nlatch-key, and flying footsteps on the stairs startled us. The handle of\r\nthe door was turned, and a thin, dark-haired young man dashed into the\r\nroom. He must have sped quickly, for he put his hand to his side, and\r\nwith difficulty gasped—\r\n\r\n“Quick! They are searching. The police are already on their way here!”\r\nThen turning to me, said, “Hide! hide, for your life!”\r\n\r\nMascha wrung her hands, crying, “Fly! fly, Anton! They must not discover\r\nyou! Fly!”\r\n\r\nI was making blindly for the door, when Liustig’s voice arrested me.\r\n\r\n“No—no time; they will meet you—you must hide!”\r\n\r\n“Where can I?” And I looked round the room in dismay.\r\n\r\n“The window—it is dark.” Mascha spoke, pointing upwards. The man who had\r\nwarned us had already disappeared.\r\n\r\nMy sister saw my hesitation. The window was high in the wall, and I could\r\nnot reach it.\r\n\r\n“Take the bag with you. Jump on my shoulders,” gasped Liustig, turning\r\nhis back and lowering his body.\r\n\r\nSomething of their anxious energy was lent to me in that supreme moment.\r\nI sprang with agility upon the proffered shoulders—I opened the window,\r\nand with a rush of cold wind came to me the measured tramp of the police\r\non the stairs.\r\n\r\nAs I crawled outside and closed the window after me, the fury of the\r\nstorm was such that I felt it would sweep me from my insecure retreat. I\r\nclutched the window-frame—my feet were on a sloping roof, which seemed to\r\nmove away under them. In my desperation I felt disposed to let myself go,\r\nfor the precious bag I had brought up seemed to drag me down. In a few\r\nmoments, however, I had found a secure resting-place for it, and, moving\r\ncautiously sideways, discovered a projection, upon which I obtained a\r\nfirm grip. Thus, by bending forward, I was enabled to see into the room,\r\nmyself unseen.\r\n\r\nOne cup had been hidden, and Mascha sat by the stove with a book in her\r\nhand. Her eyes were turned to the door as if in startled surprise. The\r\npicture she thus presented, with the two men calmly smoking cigarettes,\r\nwas tranquil, innocent, and natural.\r\n\r\nNext second five police officers burst into the room. Liustig’s manner\r\nwas perfect. His eyebrows were raised, and he looked astonishment\r\npersonified. Soliviof had gone to the door, and with a polite gesture of\r\nthe hand, seemed to invite the intruders to enter, search, and examine\r\nanything they liked.\r\n\r\nThere was an expression of mystification upon the faces of all the\r\nofficers as their glances travelled round the room. Mascha had risen\r\nto her feet, and stood with proud uplifted head in mute protest at the\r\nunseemly interruption. The _ispravnik_ stepped forward in front of\r\nSoliviof, and holding him with stern eye, evidently questioned him.\r\nAlthough I strained every nerve to hear what was being said, the howling\r\nof the wind prevented me distinguishing a single word. I could only guess\r\nwhat was transpiring by a close observation of the dumb show.\r\n\r\nSoliviof fixed steady unflinching eyes upon his examiner, and gave prompt\r\nreplies, which apparently satisfied him. Liustig was submitted to the\r\nsame cross-examination, but with perfect coolness leaned against the\r\nwall, smoking his cigarette with a half-amused air. Then came Mascha’s\r\nturn. She bore herself like an outraged queen. I saw that her manner\r\nimpressed the officer, who, when handing back her “permit to reside,”\r\nbowed courteously. But Russian officers are mostly impressionable, and\r\nthis _ispravnik_ would go through the same insipid polite formalities\r\nwere he conducting my sister to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nMascha sat down and was silent, but watched every movement of the men,\r\nwho, inactive during the examination, now received orders to prosecute a\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nThey left no corner, probable or improbable, uninvestigated; and whilst\r\nthey were busy a sudden panic of dread seized me that before they went\r\none of them might think of the roof.\r\n\r\nI drew my body up until I lay pressed flat and close to the side of the\r\ndormer window. Just as I had done so, the window opened, and a head\r\nappeared defined distinctly against the sky. The eyes pierced the gloom\r\nin my direction, but only for an instant. I scarcely dared to breathe.\r\n\r\n“There’s nobody up here,” I heard him exclaim to his companions, then\r\nslowly the head disappeared.\r\n\r\nI remained undiscovered, and the officers proceeded to other rooms to\r\nprosecute their search for incriminating papers, of which they found none.\r\n\r\nAt last I heard their heavy tramp below in the silent street. It grew\r\ngradually fainter, until it died away in the distance. Then I breathed\r\na prayer of thanksgiving, and, grasping my bag, descended into the\r\nroom. We all four uttered mutual congratulations upon having had such\r\nan excellent escape, and at once set about preparing to retire for the\r\nremainder of the night. Liustig, however, remained up in order to give\r\nthe alarm, should we again be surprised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Pashol!”\r\n\r\nThe engine of the Imperial train whistled loudly, the lines of\r\nblue-coated soldiers upon the platform saluted and cheered, and the\r\nlong saloon cars glided slowly out of the great station on their way\r\nto Moscow. Five of the carriages were occupied by the royal party and\r\nsuite—which included the Ministers of Finance and the Interior, as well\r\nas General Bieli of the Secret Police—while the sixth, which was next the\r\nengine, was the travelling kitchen. Among the servants in this latter\r\nwere Liustig and myself.\r\n\r\nHow I came to be enrolled in the Imperial service matters little. With\r\nour Organisation everything is possible. It is sufficient to say that two\r\nof the _chef’s_ assistants were taken ill—perhaps purposely for aught I\r\nknow—and that, at the last moment, Soliviof supplied us to fill their\r\nplaces. In the car with us was an officer of the “Security Section,”\r\ndisguised as a waiter; therefore my companion and myself were compelled\r\nto exercise the utmost caution.\r\n\r\nHour after hour we travelled across that great flat tract of country\r\nbetween the Valdai Hills and the Volga. But our pace was slow, and such\r\nwere the extraordinary precautions taken, that the whole distance between\r\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow was lined by troops, who seemed to sustain a\r\ncontinuous cheer as we passed. Arriving at Moscow in the evening, we did\r\nnot break the journey, but continued over the Tambov line through Central\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nIt was about two o’clock in the morning. The upper servants had retired\r\nto the sleeping compartments in order to snatch an hour’s repose, and\r\nthere were only two others beside Liustig and myself in the kitchen. I\r\nhad occasion to carry some wine through to the Imperial dining-car, and\r\nwas met at the door by the waiter-detective; nevertheless, I managed to\r\nobtain a glimpse of the interior. I saw that the Tzarina had gone to her\r\nprivate saloon, and that his Majesty was seated with two officers of his\r\nsuite, calmly smoking and laughing over his wine.\r\n\r\nReturning to my small compartment at the extreme end of the kitchen-car,\r\nI resumed my work of scouring pans, when suddenly Liustig, with white,\r\nscared face, entered, closing the door quickly after him.\r\n\r\n“By heaven! we’re lost!” he gasped, in a hoarse, frightened whisper.\r\n“Some one has placed it on end!”\r\n\r\n“How long ago?” I asked, startled at the position, which I at once\r\nrecognised as extremely critical.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Perhaps a quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation I opened the door, and, affecting carelessness,\r\npassed to the centre of the car, where there was a cupboard in which\r\nwere stored our provisions. On looking inside, I saw on the lower\r\nshelf an object which I had conveyed from London. It was certainly not\r\nsuspicious-looking; merely a small-sized loaf of white sugar, the conical\r\ntop of which had during the day been broken off and used, while part of\r\nits original blue paper wrapping still remained.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the journey I had exercised the greatest caution that\r\nit should be kept in a horizontal position; but one of the servants,\r\nprobably noticing it rolling backwards and forwards with the oscillation\r\nof the train, had set it on end in a corner of the cupboard. Stooping, I\r\nwas about to replace it in its original position, when my fingers came in\r\ncontact with some sticky liquid.\r\n\r\nI saw it was too late! Closing the cupboard, I quickly rejoined Ivan.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he whispered, “what can we do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I replied breathlessly. “We have but one chance.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“To leap for life.”\r\n\r\n“From the train?”\r\n\r\nI nodded, peering through the window into the darkness, and suddenly\r\nrecognising a station through which we passed a moment later. “We are\r\nabout eighteen versts from Borki, and close to the spot that had been\r\narranged. If you remain here, you know what fate awaits you,” I added,\r\nnoticing his hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe door was open, and the two men in the kitchen beyond were smoking\r\ncigarettes and drinking _vodka_.\r\n\r\n“Come,” I said aloud, so that they should overhear. “We are nearing\r\nBorki, I think. Let’s go outside and see. I once lived close by when I\r\nwas a youth.”\r\n\r\nHe followed me. As we stepped out upon the platform at the end of the car\r\nand adjoining the engine, I undid the latch of the little iron gate.\r\n\r\nOur pace had quickened, and we were travelling through the wide open\r\ncountry in the teeth of a fierce storm of rain and wind.\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” I said briefly, and without glancing round, sprang out upon\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nI have a dim recollection of sustaining a severe blow on the top of the\r\nskull. Then all was oblivion.\r\n\r\nOn regaining consciousness, I found myself lying upon a grassy bank near\r\nthe line, with Liustig bending over me. Day was just dawning.\r\n\r\n“Come, pull yourself together, Prèhznev,” he urged; “we must fly, or we\r\nshall be discovered.”\r\n\r\nStaggering to my feet, I rubbed my eyes, and then remembered the exciting\r\nevents of the past few hours.\r\n\r\n“The train! Where is it?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“How should I know?” he asked. “I leapt after you and it went on—to the\r\ndevil most probably.” And he grinned. “But we’ve ourselves to look after\r\nnow,” he continued. “See! our brothers of Tambov have not forgotten us!”\r\nand he pointed to a heap of clothes that lay upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“You have found them, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they were concealed in the shed yonder. We took our leave of our\r\nImperial Master just at the right spot.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, he commenced to divest himself of his clothes,\r\nafterwards attiring himself in the worn and ragged dress of a moujik,\r\nfinally enveloping himself in a _polushuba_, or outer garment of\r\nsheepskin, an example which I quickly followed. This completed, we burned\r\nour passports, and making up our clothes into a bundle, put several heavy\r\nstones in with them and sank them in a stream near by.\r\n\r\nFrom servants of the Tzar’s household we were transformed into two poor\r\npeasants whose passports, signed by the Zemski Natchalnik, allowed us to\r\nleave our Mir and emigrate abroad in search of employment.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole day we tramped along the white road that led across a\r\nbarren desolate steppe, subsequently arriving at Arkadak, a quaint rural\r\ntown, where we were sheltered for the night by the village _pope_, who\r\nwas a member of our Organisation. Facilities for our escape had been\r\nwell arranged by the Tambov Circle, for on our departure on the following\r\nmorning we found a country cart awaiting us at a lonely part of the road,\r\nand in it we were driven along the Koper valley and through the fertile\r\ncountry of the Don Cossacks to Filinovskaia, a small station on the\r\nTzaritzin-Lipetsk railway.\r\n\r\nThis being one of the trunk lines, running right across the Empire, we\r\nwere enabled to travel direct to Dunabürg, thence to Vilna, afterwards\r\ncrossing the frontier at Wirballen and reaching Königsberg, where we at\r\nonce took passages as emigrants for England.\r\n\r\nA dozen times during our adventurous journey to the frontier suspicious\r\npolice officers examined our passports, but they were always found in\r\norder, and we were allowed to proceed.\r\n\r\nOn our way we purchased the _Moscow Gazette_, the _Donskoi Pchela_, and\r\nother newspapers in order to ascertain whether the Imperial travellers\r\nhad arrived at their destination, but none of the journals mentioned the\r\nTzar’s journey. The reason of this was, as we afterwards discovered, that\r\nall references to the affair were forbidden by the censorship.\r\n\r\nFatigued and nauseated by the foulness of the steerage, we at length\r\narrived in London.\r\n\r\nSitting in an easy-chair in the bright, comfortable dining-room at\r\nthe house in Oakleigh Gardens I first learnt of the result of the\r\nattempt. Pétroff handed me a copy of the _Times_, pointing to a brief\r\nreport in the top corner of the page. It was a telegram from its Moscow\r\ncorrespondent, headed “Terrible Disaster in Russia: Narrow Escape of the\r\nImperial Family,” and ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n“A terrible catastrophe is reported from Borki. The Imperial train, with\r\nthe Tzar, Tzarina, and suite, which left St. Petersburg for Saratov, has\r\nbeen totally wrecked and partially burned. The royal party had a most\r\nmiraculous escape, for nineteen persons in the train were killed, and\r\ntwo of the servants are missing. It is evident that an explosion of some\r\nkind occurred, for all the carriages were completely shattered, and a\r\ndeep wide hole was made in the permanent way, which could not possibly\r\nhave been caused by the train leaving the rails. Full details have not\r\nyet transpired, as an order has been issued prohibiting the publication\r\nof any information. It is stated, however, that all the Imperial servants\r\nhave been placed under arrest pending an inquiry.”\r\n\r\nWe had been within an ace of success.\r\n\r\nPerhaps never had an explosion been more cleverly concealed as on that\r\noccasion. The loaf of sugar was so innocent-looking that the Tzar and\r\nhis family had actually eaten some of it! Inside, however, was a most\r\ningenious contrivance—if it is admissible to admire mechanical genius\r\nin the construction of such machines. It consisted of a small American\r\nclock attached to two glass tubes containing liquid explosives of the\r\nmost powerful description, the component parts of which, however, it is\r\nunnecessary to describe. The delicate machinery was so arranged that,\r\nproviding the sugar loaf remained in a horizontal position after being\r\nset, twenty-four hours must elapse before the tubes were broken and the\r\nliquids allowed to come into contact with one another. If, however, it\r\nwas placed on end, the clock in question would only run for a quarter of\r\nan hour, when the tubes would be broken, and a terrific explosion ensue.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement had been made so that, in the event of our inability\r\nto enter the Imperial service, we might smuggle it into the kitchen\r\nalong with the provisions, in which case a quarter of an hour after the\r\ndeparture of the train it would have been wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe failure of what was one of the most daring attempts upon the life of\r\nthe Tzar could only be explained by the machine standing in an upright\r\nposition, as, had it exploded horizontally, it would have destroyed\r\neverything near its own level, and none of the Imperial family would have\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nAs it was, it exploded in a downward direction, making the great hole in\r\nthe railway track, and causing the loss of nineteen lives, a result which\r\nno one more deeply deplored than we did ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFESSION OF VASSILII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI met Vassilii Poklévski at the post-house at Durnovskaia, a small\r\nvillage a few miles from Astrakhan. He had been recommended to me as a\r\nsteady, intelligent _yamstchik_ (driver) of superior education to the\r\naverage Muscovite, and he would, I was assured, serve me faithfully and\r\nwell on the long journey I had been compelled to undertake. I therefore\r\nengaged him. Outwardly, he was a rough, uncouth-looking fellow with\r\nunkempt grey hair and unshorn beard, but very soon I ascertained that he\r\nwas well read, and that he spoke French quite fluently.\r\n\r\nWe set out together in a rather rickety _telega_ drawn by a pair of\r\nshaggy horses I had purchased, and for a fortnight had travelled along\r\nthe post-road that follows the Volga. To inquiries as to where he had\r\npicked up his knowledge of literature and languages Vassilii always gave\r\nevasive replies, and although I knew he was an ardent supporter of the\r\nCause, I began to suspect that his past was enveloped in some mystery, a\r\nsurmise which proved correct.\r\n\r\nAt Nijni Novgorod we encountered the first snow, and exchanged our\r\n_telega_ for a sleigh. One afternoon, just as twilight was setting\r\nin, we were crossing the wide snow-covered steppe which stretched out\r\non one side from Veliki Usting as far as the eye could reach towards\r\nVondokurskoi, in Vologda Province, while on the other was a dense forest\r\nof tall gloomy pines, rendered picturesque by the hoar-frost upon the\r\nbranches. Vassilii was wrapped in his sheepskin until only his eyes and\r\nmoustache were visible, while I, enveloped in my heavy fur-coat, sat back\r\nin the sleigh ruminating.\r\n\r\nThe drive was weary, monotonous, and comfortless. In those parts of the\r\nroad sheltered by trees the coating of snow was absent, but the ground\r\nwas covered with ice. The runners of my sleigh would grind over the bare\r\npatches, and the ragged-coated little horses would flounder about on the\r\nfrozen surface, while Vassilii would crack his long-thonged whip and yell\r\nimprecations at the horses, at the ground, at the snow because it was not\r\nthere, and at the devil as the author of all his troubles.\r\n\r\nHe had driven about fifteen versts from the little town of Nikolskoi\r\ntowards Gorodezkoi, when suddenly we came upon the ruins of a good-sized\r\nhouse that had evidently been burned down a considerable time before, as\r\nivy had thickly overgrown part of the bare blackened walls. It stood\r\nnear the road, overlooking the frozen river, while at the rear was a\r\ncluster of wooden _isbas_, which I afterwards learnt formed the village\r\nof Nagorskoie. The ruin came into view as we rounded a bend in the road,\r\nand I was startled at the effect it had upon Vassilii.\r\n\r\nHe turned, looked at the black crumbling walls for a moment, then,\r\ncrossing himself and uttering a brief exhortation to the Virgin, gathered\r\nup his reins. “_Shiväi! shiväi!_” (“Faster! faster!”) he cried to his\r\nhorses, and as he brought the long thongs of his whip into play we\r\nredoubled our pace and quickly left the dilapidated building far behind.\r\n\r\nI did not seek any explanation just then, but a couple of hours later,\r\nwhen we were sitting together in the post-house at Gorodezkoi, where we\r\nhad put up for the night, I referred to the incident.\r\n\r\nThe bare room had that air of discomfort characteristic of the Russian\r\npost-station. A table, a few chairs, and a large round stove comprised\r\nthe furniture, while upon the walls hung a cheap portrait of his Majesty\r\nthe Tzar and a badly executed picture of the Virgin. A steaming _samovar_\r\nstood on the table between us, for we were taking tea and cigarettes\r\nafter our meal, and conversing in French so that the inquisitive keeper\r\nof the place should not understand what we said.\r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned the ruined house and his apparent desire to get away\r\nfrom it, Vassilii drew a long breath, passed his hand across his eyes,\r\nand gazed up to the _ikon_ hanging opposite. His _papiroska_ trembled a\r\nlittle in his lean brown hand, and he began in a voice that had a strange\r\nquiver in it.\r\n\r\n“You noticed that woman—the one with fair hair and pale complexion—who\r\ncame in for a letter just now? I spoke to her. There was such a\r\nremarkable resemblance that I could not refrain from asking her a\r\nquestion—and yet how foolish!\r\n\r\n“I am not an old man, scarcely sixty, nevertheless I might have seen a\r\ncentury of things in the years that have passed since I last sat in this\r\npost-station. I feel as though I have utterly wasted my life; still I do\r\nnot know that I regret that the sweets came first, all at once, and the\r\ndregs afterwards. Why not? One may at least sit and rail at the present,\r\nthough he envy his neighbours.\r\n\r\n“You know nothing of the tragedy that has overshadowed my life? No. Then\r\nI will tell you. See! I wear the ribbon of St. Andrew in my buttonhole.\r\nIt is worn, and the colours have faded. The Tzar bestowed it upon me\r\nfor bravery in the Crimea. Bravery! Bah! it was not valour but sheer\r\nrecklessness, because I had no desire to live longer.\r\n\r\n“The story is a queer one, and still more queer perhaps that it should be\r\nI who tell it.\r\n\r\n“In that house the ruins of which we passed this afternoon I once lived\r\nwith my father, Count Alexander Nechaieff. My mother died soon after my\r\nbirth, and all my earlier days were passed in that great gloomy old place\r\nwithout any companions of my own age. My father, the _barin_ of that\r\nwretched little village of Nagorskoie, owned many serfs. He was cruel,\r\nharsh, unjust, and hard-hearted, and the peasants regarded him with\r\nterror. This part of Vologda is, you see, flat and exposed; the soil is\r\npoor, the population sparse, and the long winter is always more severe\r\nthan away in Petersburg. The consequence of this was that the inhabitants\r\nof Nagorskoie had become wild and embittered, for my father’s exactions\r\nhad reduced his serfs to the direst poverty; the _isbas_ were devoid of\r\nall but absolute necessities, the fields neglected, and the wretched\r\n_moujiks_ starving. In the majority of the cottages the stove had gone\r\nout owing to lack of fuel, and the _samovar_ disused because there was no\r\ntea. The poverty was worse than in previous years, and the peasantry were\r\ndriven to despair.\r\n\r\n“One day, in the bitterest season of that merciless winter, my father\r\nand I were sitting before the stove in the dining-room, smoking our\r\n_papiroski_ after our mid-day meal. I was then only twenty, having just\r\nreturned from my studies at Moscow. The room in which we sat was cosy\r\nand well furnished, for my father, arrogant and selfish, denied himself\r\nno luxury, and led a life of idleness and ease, spending half his time at\r\nPetersburg, and the remainder at Nagorskoie.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly Artem Makaroff, my father’s secretary, entered. I had always\r\ndisliked him, for he was an oleaginous, soft-spoken man whose ugly face\r\nalways wore a sinister expression. Addressing my father, he said—\r\n\r\n“‘_Barin_, some of the people desire to see you. They are waiting\r\noutside.’\r\n\r\n“‘To see me!’ asked my father, in surprise. ‘What do they want?’\r\n\r\n“‘They refuse to tell me, _barin_. They say they must see you personally.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! very well!’ cried my father, rising angrily and standing with his\r\nback to the stove. ‘If there is any grumbling or sign of disaffection,\r\nI’ll teach them a lesson. Let them enter.’\r\n\r\n“Artem retired, and a few moments later the _starosta_ came in,\r\naccompanied by about a dozen half-starved, shivering _moujiks_ with\r\nwhite, haggard faces and ragged sheepskins.\r\n\r\n“‘Well!’ exclaimed my father, scanning them with angry eye. ‘What does\r\nthis mean, pray? What right have you to come here in a body?’\r\n\r\n“‘Have pity, _barin_,’ implored the elder, bending himself almost double.\r\n‘We have come to beg mercy of you, to cast ourselves upon your sympathy.’\r\n\r\n“‘What for?’\r\n\r\n“‘We are starving, our cattle are dying, our homes have been denuded of\r\nalmost everything, and—and we cannot pay your rent, your High Nobility.\r\nWe have come to beg you to allow us time.’\r\n\r\n“The serfs held their tattered caps in their hands and fidgeted uneasily\r\nwhile their _starosta_ was speaking. There was a look of intense anxiety\r\nupon their pinched faces, for they had been driven to the last extremity.\r\n\r\n“‘It is your duty to pay me,’ replied my father impatiently. ‘If you do\r\nnot I shall treat it as insubordination. You know what that means.’\r\n\r\n“‘_Batiushka!_’ exclaimed the white-haired old man whose head was bowed.\r\n‘We cannot pay just yet, even if our Father the Tzar came himself and\r\ndemanded the tax.’\r\n\r\n“‘Silence!’ thundered my father. ‘You shall pay it. I’ll hear no excuses,\r\nyou understand. It must be paid within a week from to-day—every kopeck.’\r\n\r\n“The _starosta_ shook his head sorrowfully, saying—\r\n\r\n“‘Your High Nobility, it is impossible. We have no money, and we have\r\nnothing that we can sell.’\r\n\r\n“‘No more words!’ my father cried. ‘I’ll not be dictated to. You have\r\nnothing that you can sell, have you? Very well. I give you one week in\r\nwhich to find the money.’\r\n\r\n“‘Have you no pity, _barin_?’ implored the old man.\r\n\r\n“My father smiled sarcastically. ‘Begone! You know my decision,’ he said\r\ncoldly, and, lighting a fresh cigarette, turned his back upon them.\r\n\r\n“Broken-hearted and despairing, the starving _moujiks_ filed slowly out\r\nof the warm, well-furnished room, and with revenge in their souls sought\r\ntheir own cheerless homes. I endeavoured to mediate on behalf of the poor\r\nwretches, but to my supplications my father turned a deaf ear. ‘No, I’ll\r\nteach the brutes a lesson,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“He kept his word, for within a week the knout fell heavily upon the\r\nbacks of some of the defaulters. These arbitrary acts nearly caused a\r\nrevolt, but this was rapidly suppressed by my father, who caused the\r\nringleaders, together with the _starosta_ to receive publicly two hundred\r\nlashes, as a warning to all who tried to oppose his authority.\r\n\r\n“The weeks passed, the snow disappeared, and spring came.\r\n\r\n“My favourite spot was at the bottom of the lower garden, on a little\r\nbridge that was thrown over a small swamp. The view was extremely\r\nrestricted, but very melancholy and pleasing. There was a small pond\r\nwith overgrown banks, directly behind it was the dense pine forest, and\r\ndrooping over the pond was an ancient birch clinging to the damp bank\r\nwith its thick roots, and swaying its curling branches over the unruffled\r\nsurface of the pool, which gave back the reflection of the drooping\r\nboughs and surrounding greenery.\r\n\r\n“Seated one afternoon upon an old stump I was smoking, enjoying the\r\nbright sunshine and calm solitude, when suddenly I discovered an\r\nintruder. Leaning on the railing of the little bridge, with her profile\r\ntowards me, and looking down into the water, was a young girl. She had\r\nevidently forgotten herself, and had no thought that she was being\r\nobserved. Her large eyes were full of intent observation, of deep clear\r\nthought, her pose was unaffected, yet hers was the most beautiful face I\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\n“A tall, graceful figure, well set off by her picturesque peasant dress,\r\ntiny hands, delicate and white, a clear, fresh complexion, deep violet\r\neyes with long black lashes, wavy auburn hair, and small white teeth just\r\nvisible between a pair of lips that seemed made alone for kisses, while\r\nher features had that sweet, half-sad expression that is the birth-gift\r\nof every Russian woman, rich or poor.\r\n\r\n“I rose, and advancing, greeted her. She blushed deeply and appeared\r\nconfused. Very soon, however, we were chatting in friendly manner, and\r\nshe told me her name was Natiónka, and that she was the daughter of old\r\nSavischnoff, one of my father’s serfs.\r\n\r\n“After an hour’s pleasant gossip I walked with her to her home, a small,\r\nlonely cottage in the heart of the forest, five versts along the road to\r\nSeniki. Had she been of noble birth she could not have treated me with\r\nmore queenly reserve, and before I bade her good-bye we had arranged to\r\nmeet on the morrow.\r\n\r\n“From that time I waited for her daily in a secluded part of the\r\nforest, into which no one ever penetrated. As you may well guess I fell\r\nviolently in love with her, even though she was but the daughter of a\r\npoor wood-cutter. We kept our secret, meeting clandestinely with only the\r\nchattering birds in the trees above as witnesses. As a token of affection\r\nI had given her a small heart-shaped locket of blue malachite set round\r\nwith diamonds and containing my miniature. This she wore concealed in the\r\nbreast of her dress.\r\n\r\n“So four months passed—bright months, sunny months. I adored her with all\r\nmy being, and she, in return, loved me passionately.”\r\n\r\nVassilii tossed his dead cigarette away, and passed his hand again\r\nwearily over his eyes, brushing away what appeared suspiciously like a\r\ntear. Sighing heavily, as if the recollection of Natiónka stirred sad and\r\npainful memories, he murmured an apology. Then he went on, talking to\r\nhimself rather than to me.\r\n\r\n“I summoned courage at last to go to old Savischnoff. His _isba_ was\r\npoorly furnished but clean, and the _ikon_ was over the door—always a\r\ngood sign. When we were alone I told him how I loved his daughter, and\r\nthe effect of the announcement was almost magical.\r\n\r\n“‘What! You love her? You love Natiónka?’ the old man gasped in a fierce\r\nwhisper. ‘No, no, you must not,’ he urged. ‘What would the _barin_ say?\r\nIf he knew, he would kill my child.’\r\n\r\n“I laughed at his consternation. ‘Have no fear,’ I said. ‘I shall marry\r\nher, and as my wife she will be under my protection.’\r\n\r\n“‘No. A thousand times, no!’ he declared. ‘Think! It would bring ruin and\r\ndeath upon us.’\r\n\r\n“‘Bah! Leave it all to me,’ I said. I was young, madly impetuous, and\r\nNatiónka was my idol. Little did I imagine that the drama would have such\r\na _dénouement_.\r\n\r\n“Our wedding took place on a day in bright autumn. I told the Count\r\nthat I had grown tired of Nagorskoie, and intended to go to Nijni for\r\na change. To this he raised no objection, and I set out alone with a\r\n_tarantass_. Twelve versts along the road I found Natiónka awaiting me,\r\nand we drove together to the village _pope_ at Dinkova, who, according\r\nto previous arrangement, made us man and wife. Then we travelled on to\r\nNijni, and after three weeks’ absence returned to Nagorskoie. We were\r\nstill bound to keep our marriage secret, therefore Natiónka went home and\r\nwe both led the same lives as before, spending whole days together in\r\nthe solitude of the great pine forest, happy in each other’s love.\r\n\r\n“She was charming. But, alas! how brief a paradise was ours.\r\n\r\n“Standing one evening at our favourite spot in the wood, with my wife\r\nclasped to my breast, I was uttering words of passionate affection and\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n“‘I want you to assume your proper position,’ I said. ‘Yet I confess,\r\nNatiónka, that I dare not tell my father.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, do not tell him,’ she urged earnestly. ‘For the present let us\r\nremain as we are. If your father knew he would separate us. He would send\r\nme to another serf-owner, as he did Anna Ivanovna, Marya Zadlewski, and\r\nthe others.’\r\n\r\n“‘Fear not, little one,’ I replied reassuringly. ‘He dare not send you\r\naway now you are my wife.’\r\n\r\n“‘Could you not take me to Petersburg or Moscow, where we could live\r\ntogether unknown?’ she suggested. ‘You have enough money to do that,\r\nhaven’t you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, dearest. But unfortunately you are still a serf. If you left the\r\nestate he could have you arrested. He even has the right by law to exile\r\nyou to Siberia for desertion. This latter course he would certainly adopt\r\nif he knew we were wedded.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah! You are right,’ she replied sorrowfully. ‘I never thought of that.’\r\n\r\n“At that moment we were startled at hearing the cracking of dried twigs,\r\napparently broken by footsteps. Holding our breath we listened.\r\n\r\n“‘A wolf perhaps!’ exclaimed Natiónka in alarm.\r\n\r\n“I drew my revolver and waited.\r\n\r\n“‘No!’ I exclaimed aloud, as I caught a glimpse of a figure moving\r\nstealthily among the trunks of the trees. ‘Not a wolf, but a more\r\ndangerous animal, Artem Makaroff, my father’s agent!’\r\n\r\n“It was evident that he had followed us, listened to our conversation,\r\nand overheard the declaration I had made regarding our marriage! I felt\r\ncertain that sooner or later he would betray us.\r\n\r\n“On my return home that night the Count was unusually gracious towards\r\nme, and, after watching him narrowly, I came to the conclusion that Artem\r\nhad not informed him of the incident. In the course of the evening,\r\nhowever, my father’s habitual moroseness returned, and he sat smoking and\r\nthinking. Suddenly he grew confidential, and said—\r\n\r\n“‘Vassilii, will you do me a favour? I am in a financial difficulty, and\r\nI want you to take a letter to our friend Mikhailovitch, at Vasilova, and\r\nbring back the money he will give you.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very well,’ I replied. ‘When shall I start?’\r\n\r\n“‘At daybreak. You must be in Vasilova by the day after to-morrow,\r\notherwise he will have departed for Petersburg.’\r\n\r\n“I announced my readiness to go, and he wrote the letter. At dawn I\r\nset out on horseback for Mikhailovitch’s, distant two days’ journey by\r\nroad. Unsuspicious of any double dealing, I had not told Natiónka of my\r\ndeparture, for as I should only be absent four days I knew she would not\r\nfeel any uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“It was not before noon that the suspicion crossed my mind that I had\r\nbeen sent on the errand for an ulterior purpose. Try how I would I could\r\nnot get rid of the thought that I had left Natiónka unprotected. Indeed,\r\na strange presage of evil seemed to possess me, forcing me at last to\r\nturn and ride with all speed back to Nagorskoie. The afterglow was in\r\nthe sky when I spurred my horse into the village. Something unusual had\r\nevidently happened, for all the inhabitants had collected in the tiny\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\n“As I dismounted and turned the corner into the open space a shrill\r\nscream broke upon my ear. Looking round upon the white, scared faces of\r\nthe assembled _moujiks_, I saw that the cause of the commotion was a\r\npublic knouting.\r\n\r\n“Elbowing my way to the centre of the throng, I reached the\r\nwhipping-post, where a scene of inhuman brutality met my eyes, causing\r\nthe spirit of murder to enter my soul.\r\n\r\n“Stretched face downwards was the form of a woman, whose wrists and\r\nankles were bound tightly to an inclined wooden frame. Her back was\r\ncovered with blood, the flesh having been cut into strips by the thongs\r\nof the terrible knout, which, wielded by a brawny brutal servant of\r\nmy father’s, was falling with monotonous regularity upon the victim.\r\nThe Count, with folded arms, stood near, watching the torture with\r\nundisguised satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“At first I could not see the face of the unfortunate girl, but a few\r\nseconds later I recognised the colour of the hair and the distorted\r\nfeatures. It was Natiónka!\r\n\r\n“Rushing forward with a wild cry I flung myself upon the man who was\r\nadministering the horrible punishment. I was young and athletic, and\r\nsucceeded in arresting the blow that was falling, an action which was\r\nregarded with approval by the crowd of indignant but trembling serfs.\r\n\r\n“‘You have no right here,’ cried the Count, white with rage. ‘Return to\r\nthe house at once!’\r\n\r\n“‘What is the meaning of this?’ I demanded fiercely. ‘What has she done?’\r\n\r\n“‘It is no business of yours. The wench is insubordinate; to-morrow she\r\nstarts for Siberia.’\r\n\r\n“‘She will not. She is my wife,’ I cried.\r\n\r\n“‘I am well aware of that,’ he answered coldly. Then, turning to the\r\ngrinning brute who had been interrupted, he added, ‘Ivan, give her the\r\ndeath-blow.’\r\n\r\n“I knew that if the knout fell it would prove fatal. The death-blow\r\nseldom fails to despatch the victim. Springing towards him I endeavoured\r\nto arrest the stroke.\r\n\r\n“But too late! The heavy leaden-weighted thongs struck the insensible\r\ngirl with a noise like a pistol-shot.\r\n\r\n“Turning upon my father I cursed him. But he merely laughed, and,\r\nlighting a fresh cigarette, affected to treat my angry passion with utter\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n“With my pocket-knife I severed the cords that bound my hapless wife to\r\nthe reeking frame, and, lifting her off, held her in my arms.\r\n\r\n“I kissed her ashen, blood-smeared face, and eagerly placed my hand upon\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\n“There was no movement. She was dead!\r\n\r\n“When I withdrew my hand the little blue malachite heart fell to the\r\nground. It had been broken in half by the pressure of the body against\r\nthe frame.\r\n\r\n“Lifting my face to heaven, I swore that the murder of the woman I loved\r\nshould be avenged.\r\n\r\n“But my father only laughed sarcastically. ‘Bah! you’re but a lad,’ he\r\nsaid contemptuously, as he turned away. ‘And, after all, death under the\r\nknout is preferable to work in the mines.’”\r\n\r\nVassilii was silent and thoughtful. Then, with a muttered imprecation, he\r\nground his teeth, and his lean hands clenched tightly.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes passed before he resumed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my father caused my wife to be murdered. The wretched peasants, who\r\nwere compelled by their master to witness his brutality, were ripe for\r\nrevolt, this inhuman act having aroused their fiercest indignation and\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n“Insane with grief, I wandered alone in the forest, but on the night\r\nof the second day, when I sought food and shelter at old Savischnoff’s\r\n_isba_, I was surprised to find a dozen determined-looking men assembled\r\nthere. Without hesitation they boldly informed me that it was their\r\nintention to proceed to the _Barin’s_ house and avenge Natiónka’s death.\r\nHeedless of consequences I assumed the leadership of the band. In the\r\ndead of night we broke into the house, and three of us crept stealthily\r\nupstairs to where the Count lay sleeping. When I struck a match he sprang\r\nup in alarm, but I clutched him tightly by the throat.\r\n\r\n“Recognising me, and noticing the long keen knife in my hand, he gasped——\r\n\r\n“‘Mercy, Vassilii! Surely you would not kill me?’\r\n\r\n“‘What mercy did you extend to her?’ I cried. ‘Why, none. You murdered\r\nher.’ At that moment I seemed possessed of fiendish strength, and in my\r\nmad demoniacal grasp he was absolutely powerless.\r\n\r\n“Laughing at his entreaties, I raised the weapon and plunged it deep into\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n“Then, appalled by my horrible crime, I stole out of the room and left\r\nthe house with the murderous band; not, however, before they had set\r\nfire to the place in order to destroy the evidence of the murder.\r\n\r\n“Before the sun rose I was already on my journey south, and the house\r\nwas a pile of smouldering ruins. For weeks I, a conscience-stricken\r\nparricide, rode onward until I reached the Caspian shore. Assuming the\r\nname of Vassilii Poklévski I obtained employment as a post-driver at\r\nDurnovskaia, where I have lived ever since. The police subsequently\r\ndiscovered that my father had been murdered, and searched diligently\r\nfor the assassin, but it never occurred to them that he had adopted the\r\ndisguise of a Volga _yamstchik_.\r\n\r\n“So the years have passed. I have never visited the spot where I\r\ncommitted my crime until to-day, lest I should betray myself.\r\n\r\n“Poor Natiónka! Is it surprising that I am sad to-night? Is it surprising\r\nthat I am a revolutionist? One memento only I possess of her—the blue\r\nheart. See! here it is. Broken! An emblem of her own tragic end.”\r\n\r\nVassilii handed me the two halves of the malachite ornament, which he had\r\ntaken from a small, well-worn bag of chamois leather. I saw how costly\r\nthe locket must have been when new, for the diamonds set around the edge\r\nwere large and of the first water. When, after examining the broken\r\nportions, I handed them back to him, he sighed, and carefully replaced\r\nthem in his pocket. Then rising, he wished me “Good-night” in a strained,\r\nharsh voice, and sought his room.\r\n\r\nNext day we continued our journey to Onega.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFALSE ZERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bright July evening, a white dusty Italian road, and a fugitive from\r\njustice mounted upon a stout pony, with an outfit consisting of a\r\nwell-filled canvas valise and a revolver.\r\n\r\nThe police were searching for me, and in consequence I had a few weeks\r\nbefore escaped from England, and set out upon a wandering journey\r\neastward across Europe. I was in Emilia, lonely, tired, and dispirited,\r\nhaving left Piacenza at early morning and ridden on throughout the\r\nscorching day. It had, however, grown cooler, for which I was thankful.\r\nThe wind had risen, blowing softly from mountain and from sea across the\r\nplains, through the pines of Pavia, and across the oak forests at the\r\nbase of the Apennines.\r\n\r\nNow and then a puff of blue wood-smoke rose through the branches from\r\ncharcoal-burners’ cabins; now and then some great magnolia flower\r\nshivered its rosy needles upon me as I passed beneath the trees; far away\r\nbelow the _Ave Maria_ was chiming from the church towers in the plain;\r\nabove, low rain clouds, fretted and edged with amber, floated near the\r\nsun; over all the day was of that wondrous hue which is like the soft\r\nviolet blue of the iris, and is clear yet mystical, as children’s eyes\r\nwhen they wake from dreams of angels.\r\n\r\nAs I road slowly up the long mountain road, I was overtaken by a\r\nhorseman, who, light-hearted and happy, was singing to himself staves of\r\ncontadini choruses. He rode up beside me with a genial, “_Buona sera,\r\nsignore_.”\r\n\r\nHe was a fine-looking man of about thirty, with a dark, pointed beard\r\nand waxed moustaches. We rode on together up the hill, and fell into\r\nconversation. He inquired where I was from, and my destination, to which\r\nI replied that I was travelling for pleasure. He told me that he was a\r\nvine-grower living in Marengo, and that he was returning from a business\r\nvisit to Cremona. When we stopped for water at a roadside spring, he\r\nasked me to carry a small pair of saddlebags, as his horse was tired out.\r\nI complied cheerfully, and we pushed on up the steep road. Arrived at the\r\ntop, he took a cross-road, remarking that he believed we should reach the\r\n_albergo_ of Padrone Vincenti before the moon rose.\r\n\r\nI found him a pleasant, entertaining Italian, and being, no doubt,\r\nconceited, imagined that he found me the same. It was dusk when we rode\r\nup to a ruined villa, high upon the mountain-side—vast, crumbling,\r\ndesolate. It was one of those old villas, of which there are hundreds\r\nin Italy, standing on their pale olive slopes. Those who are strange to\r\nthem see only the peeling plaster, the discoloured stone, the desolate\r\ncourts, the grass-grown flags, the broken statues, the straying, unkempt\r\nvines, the look of utter loneliness and decay. But those who know them\r\nwell, love them and learn otherwise; learn the infinite charm of the\r\nsilent halls, of the endless echoing corridors, of the wide, frescoed,\r\nwind-swept, and sun-bathed chambers, and of the shadowy logge where the\r\nroseglow of the oleander burns in the dimness of the arches, and the\r\nlizards bask in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nIt was charmingly situated. The old place had once belonged to a great\r\nfamily, but was now half-ruined; the few rooms remaining intact having\r\nbeen transformed into an inn.\r\n\r\nAs we rode up to the porch, a slender girl of about seventeen, with\r\nbig black eyes, and dark hair coiled tightly, fastened with a Genoese\r\nfiligree pin, came running round the corner of the house. She looked as\r\nwild as the goats on the mountain-side, and my first thought was, “What a\r\nbeauty she will some day be!” I raised my wide-brimmed sun hat, and asked\r\nif we could obtain accommodation for the night.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she said shortly. “But I will ask father,” and she darted\r\ninto the house.\r\n\r\nA moment later an old man made his appearance, rubbing his hands and\r\nsmiling benignly. “How are you, signori?” he asked in his _patois_. “Want\r\nto stop? Very well. Here, Ninetta, call Giovanni to take the horses.”\r\n\r\nI had just dismounted, and started to remove the saddlebags, when a\r\nglance at my travelling companion checked me. He was gazing down the road\r\nand listening intently. I saw an anxious look overspread his face. The\r\nnext moment he stuck spurs into his horse, and, without a word galloped\r\ndown the road in the opposite direction in the gathering gloom.\r\n\r\nSurprised and alarmed, I sprang into the saddle, and, as the sound of\r\nhorses approaching at a rapid rate greeted my ears, I started off down\r\nthe road after my late companion. My first thought was that brigands were\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\nGlancing back, I saw a number of horsemen riding furiously down upon me.\r\nI heard loud oaths in Italian, and orders to halt. Without heeding them,\r\nI spurred on, and drawing my revolver, determined to sell my life as\r\ndearly as possible. The next moment a volley of shots rang out, and my\r\nhorse stumbled and fell.\r\n\r\nBefore I could rise I was surrounded by three gendarmes and a rough crowd\r\nof men, nearly all of whom were half mad with drink and excitement. Cries\r\nof joy were heard on all sides, and a dozen hands seized me in no gentle\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“We want you,” replied one of the gendarmes, stepping forward, “Your\r\nname is Anton Prèhznev!”\r\n\r\nMy heart stood still. The police had tracked me!\r\n\r\n“Well, and if it is? What then?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“We arrest you for murder and conspiracy!”\r\n\r\nHis words gave my arms a demoniacal strength. In a moment I had freed\r\nmyself, and scarcely knowing why I did so, I quickly pointed my revolver\r\nat a man who attempted to recapture me, and pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nThere was a bright flash, a report, and the man fell back into the arms\r\nof one of his companions.\r\n\r\nCries of “Kill him!” “Shoot him!” “Hang him!” were heard on all sides,\r\nwhile I stood, revolver in hand, ready to defend myself.\r\n\r\n“Let’s take him back to old Vincenti’s and hear what he’s got to say,”\r\nsaid a tall man, who seemed to be leader.\r\n\r\nThis proposition met with general disfavour, especially from one\r\nofficious man, the leader of the band of brigands who had resolved to\r\nassist the gendarmes in my capture, who produced a long pair of reins,\r\nand leading the way to a spreading oak-tree that stood near, exclaimed,\r\n“Here’s a good limb. Come, fetch him along.”\r\n\r\nBut the tall man demurred and had his way. “If he can’t give a proper\r\naccount of himself, we’ll make short work of him,” he said.\r\n\r\nI attempted to explain, but a pistol was held at my head with a\r\nperemptory command to be silent. My arms were then bound, and I was\r\nmarched back to the half-ruined villa and placed in one corner of the\r\ncommon room of the inn.\r\n\r\nThe crowd demanded wine, which was served by Vincenti. The girl Ninetta\r\nstood at the door looking at me curiously, and I thought rather\r\npityingly. My trial then began. It was brief and to the point. They had\r\nreceived my description from both the English and Russian police, and\r\nby the latter a large reward had been offered for my capture. They had\r\ntracked me thus far, and by the random shot I had fired I had mortally\r\nwounded one of their companions.\r\n\r\nWithout admitting that I was the man they were looking for, I made\r\nup a fictitious story, declaring my innocence. It was listened to\r\nincredulously by most of them, but among a few I thought I saw looks that\r\nencouraged me, and I wound up with an impromptu appeal for life which I\r\nfelt must touch them. I was doomed to bitter disappointment, when the man\r\nwho had been so officiously anxious to hang me at once, rose, remarking\r\nwith a harsh laugh: “No, no, you can’t deceive us in that way. Come on.\r\nLet’s hang him!”\r\n\r\nSeveral rose, and with loud, deep, voluble oaths supported the\r\nsuggestion. My blood ran cold as I realised my imminent peril. These\r\nrough fellows from Piacenza felt perfectly justified in hanging me to the\r\nnearest tree, seeing that I had shot one of their number. What could I\r\ndo? I gazed from one to the other like a hunted animal.\r\n\r\n“Surely you would not hang a man without evidence,” I cried. “I can show\r\nyou letters to prove who I am.”\r\n\r\nThe tall man, whom they called Luigi, stepped up and unbound my\r\nhands. I drew forth a note I received while in Paris. It contained a\r\n_carte-de-visite_ of my sister Mascha, which fell to the floor as I drew\r\nout the letter. Luigi picked it up.\r\n\r\n“It is my sister’s picture,” I cried. “Here, read the letter any of you.\r\nIt will prove that I am an honest man.”\r\n\r\nLuigi gazed earnestly at the picture. “_Dio mio!_ she’s a beauty!” he\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\nThe picture was passed round, but opinions were freely expressed that she\r\nwas not my sister at all. Ninetta crowded in among the men and asked to\r\nsee the photograph. Luigi handed it to her, jocosely remarking that he\r\nwould marry her when she grew to be as handsome as that.\r\n\r\nShe quietly replied: “He speaks the truth!” and gazed intently on the\r\nphotograph. “I’ll swear that’s his sister,” she added presently.\r\n\r\n“I’m inclined to think so, too,” remarked Luigi. “I think we’d better\r\nwait and take him back to Piacenza.”\r\n\r\nAt this there was a dissenting murmur, which grew so strong that my\r\ncourage failed again. Suddenly Luigi turned to the crowd and cried. “Let\r\nus give him a chance. I’ll play him at dominoes. If he loses we’ll end\r\nhis troubles. What do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Capital idea. Let him be tried by his skill with the ivories!” cried\r\none of the men, and the scheme seemed to tickle the fancy of the crowd.\r\nThey evidently had confidence in Luigi’s ability to play dominoes.\r\nUnfortunately it was a game of which I knew nothing, and I told them so.\r\n\r\nNinetta was still standing beside Luigi. “Let me play for him,” she said\r\neagerly. “Luck is always with me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let her play,” cried the men, evidently amused at the novelty of\r\nthe thing, and also sure that the old Italian’s superior skill would\r\nwin. “Yes, let Ninetta play for him. Give her your money,” they said,\r\naddressing me.\r\n\r\nI looked at the girl curiously. Her big dark eyes were glittering with\r\nexcitement, but she was cool and self-possessed. Taking out my purse\r\nwhich contained my wealth, about £70 in fifty lire notes, I handed it to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe dominoes were produced, and in a few moments she and Luigi were\r\nseated opposite each other, and the game began.\r\n\r\nIt was a weird scene, and I had the odd feeling that I was simply a\r\nspectator and in no way concerned. I remember wishing for paints that I\r\nmight transfer it to canvas. What a picture it would make! The quaint,\r\nold-fashioned, frescoed room; the smoky lamps shedding a sickly light\r\nupon the eager group around the table. I could see the face of Ninetta,\r\nand knew that in all probability my life hung upon her skill.\r\n\r\nShe played in silence, except when she shuffled the clicking dominoes\r\nunderneath her small sun-tanned hands. It was an even game for a while,\r\nuntil the old Italian began to win, and her pile of notes steadily\r\ndiminished. She played coolly on, despite the comments of the crowd. She\r\nwas down to her last note when the luck turned in her favour. She won\r\nsteadily, gathering back the notes, until Luigi had scarcely any left. He\r\nbegan to turn up his dominoes cautiously, having evidently no desire to\r\nbe beaten by a girl.\r\n\r\nI watched Ninetta’s face closely for some sign of excitement, but none\r\nwas visible. She was thoroughly self-possessed, and the fact that she\r\nheld my life in her hands had no outward effect upon her. Fortune\r\nfavoured Luigi again, and they were soon about even. The men who crowded\r\naround the table grew impatient. “_Siete un figurino, Luigi! Sta a\r\nvoi giuocare._ Bah! you’re afraid of her! you don’t bet,” and like\r\nexpressions were heard, while the others encouraged my little champion.\r\nHer father came to where she sat, and patting her upon the shoulder,\r\nremarked, “Ninetta was always a lucky girl.”\r\n\r\nThey commenced to play, and it was the man’s shuffle. The betting was\r\nhigh. Ninetta glanced at her dominoes in an uncertain way, and then at\r\nthe few limp notes at her elbow. She had thirty lire less than he. The\r\nexcitement was intense. For a moment only heavy breathing could be\r\nheard; then the bright-eyed girl laughed nervously and pushed the whole\r\nof the notes into the pool.\r\n\r\nHer opponent threw in the rest of his money, breaking into a discordant\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“It’s the last game,” he said, glancing over at me. “Sorry for you, but\r\nyou can prepare for death. Well, what have you got, Ninetta?”\r\n\r\nShe quietly turned up the double-six, and one by one exhibited dominoes\r\nof high denomination. He struck the table a blow that made the ivories\r\njingle. “_Dio! Domino!_ Luck is always on your side; I’d have staked my\r\nlast couple of _soldi_ that I held a winning hand, but the double-six was\r\ntoo much for me! Come, comrades, let’s have some wine and drink to my bad\r\nluck!”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the small bar at the end of the room, followed by the\r\ncrowd and the gendarmes, now appearing in the best of humours. Ninetta\r\ncalmly swept up the notes, crushed them into my purse and handed it to\r\nme, remarking laconically, “You’d better take this and get over the\r\nApennines to Vernazza, where you can get a passage on board a steamer.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it all,” I exclaimed. “Only what is mine.”\r\n\r\n“Keep it all. It’s yours. They’ve killed your horse,” and before I could\r\nsay anything further, my fair protector had left the room.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to put as much distance as possible between myself\r\nand the uncouth crowd, but on reflection I remembered that there was\r\nno other house for miles, that I knew nothing of the country, and if\r\nI started out on foot I was liable to be attacked by the thieves who\r\ninfested the district. I therefore put on a bold front and asked old\r\nVincenti to give me a lodging for the night. He picked up a guttering\r\ncandle, called Ninetta, and told her to show me upstairs. We entered a\r\nlarge chamber that had evidently once been the ball-room of the villa.\r\nThere were several beds in it, and on a table beside one she placed the\r\ncandle, and was about to leave when I detained her.\r\n\r\n“Ninetta, I have not thanked you for what you have done for me to-night.\r\nMy life is not worth much, but I should have hated to give it up in such\r\na manner. Is there nothing I can do to show my gratitude?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed in an embarrassed manner. “Why, it wasn’t anything. I like to\r\nplay; I’d have done it for anybody.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure of that; but is there nothing I can do for you?”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment. “No,” she replied, “there is nothing you can do\r\nnow. Some day, perhaps, I shall be glad of your assistance.”\r\n\r\n“You will always find me your willing servant,” I replied fervently.\r\n\r\nI grasped her hand warmly, and she wished me a merry “_Buona notte_.”\r\n\r\nI did not see her about the house next morning. The fierce party of the\r\nnight before had left. I inquired for Ninetta, but was informed that\r\nshe had gone off early to attend to her goats on the mountain-side. The\r\nold Tuscan woman who acted as cook provided me with a hearty breakfast,\r\nand presently a peasant’s cart halted on its way to Vernazza. Arranging\r\nwith the driver to give me a lift, I mounted beside him with a feeling of\r\ninexpressible relief. Half an hour later, as we rounded a curve in the\r\nmountain road, we came face to face with Ninetta. She was mounted on a\r\nmule, and galloped rapidly past, her hair streaming in the wind. I had\r\nonly time to raise my hat in response to a smile of recognition, when she\r\npassed, as I then thought, out of my life for ever.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards I arrived at Leghorn, and, taking a passage on board\r\na steamer bound for New York, bade farewell to the sunny garden of\r\nEurope, which, I felt convinced, was a decidedly dangerous place wherein\r\nto sojourn, having regard to the curious circumstances of my capture and\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of aimless wandering and hiding from the police I again\r\ntrod Italian soil. Even in far-off Manitoba intelligence had reached me\r\nof punishments imposed upon the gendarmes who had acted so leniently\r\ntowards me. Two years, however, is a long time, and having a mission to\r\nexecute for our Cause in Italy—my personal appearance being so altered as\r\nto be unrecognisable—I returned.\r\n\r\nThe long, bright day had drawn to a close. The west was a blaze of gold\r\nagainst which the ilex and the acacia were black as funeral plumes, while\r\nin the quaint, crooked streets of ancient Nervi people were moving,\r\nenjoying the _bel fresco_ after the burden of the scorching day.\r\n\r\nThe sun glowed and sank beyond the calm, sparkling Mediterranean, and in\r\nthe tender violet hues of the east the moon rose. Crimson clouds drifted\r\nagainst the azure, and were reflected as in a mirror on the broad Gulf of\r\nGenoa. San Giovanni’s tower stood out clear against the yellow sky, and\r\nits bells chimed solemnly.\r\n\r\nAs the hour wore on, evening fell. Boats glided over the glassy sea; on\r\nthe hills the cypresses were black against the faint gold that lingered\r\nin the west, and there was an odour of carnations and acacias everywhere.\r\nNoiseless footsteps came and went. People passed softly in shadow. The\r\nmoonlight was sweet and clear upon the ancient tower and time-worn\r\nstones; in the stillness the little torrents made sad rushing sounds as\r\nthey plashed towards the sea. Across the moss-grown piazza an old monk\r\nwalked slowly and thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nLeaving the _osteria_ where I had taken up a temporary abode, I strolled\r\nthrough the quaint little half-deserted town, and out upon the road which\r\nran by the sea-shore towards old Savona. Engrossed in my own thoughts, I\r\nhad been standing watching the shadows chase the sun-rays on the dusky\r\npurple sides of the Apennines, and the fireflies dancing away their brief\r\nlives among the boughs of the magnolias and over the fields of maize.\r\n\r\nA cigarette between my lips, I was heedless of where I walked. As I\r\npassed a row of small cottages, and emerged upon the broad Corniche\r\nRoad, the strains of mandolines played by happy, light-hearted fishermen\r\ngreeted my ears, accompanied by snatches of peasant songs.\r\n\r\nI am not a fatalist, neither have I any spiritualistic tendencies,\r\nbut there are times when I am half inclined to believe in a distinct\r\npower—magnetic, if you will.\r\n\r\nI think I must have slept, as I have only the most vague recollection of\r\nmy promenade.\r\n\r\nWhen I became fully aware of things around me, I found myself sitting\r\nin an armchair, with my chin resting upon my hands. There was a dim,\r\nindistinct consciousness of realising that a storm had occurred—that I\r\nhad seen a light and knocked timidly at a cottage door.\r\n\r\nA young woman in peasant costume, and very beautiful, was sitting beside\r\nme. I glanced slowly round the humble interior. We were alone. Little\r\nby little I remembered. It was she who had opened the door and bade me\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThough sad, her face pleased me. Were it not for her light breathing I\r\nshould think she was of wax.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell what air of recognition I found in her voice and manner.\r\nInstantly, however, I remembered a half-forgotten period, like a queer\r\ndream; a name was upon my lips, but I could not utter it. I stammered a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” she said, amused; “they tell me I have altered; yet—why,\r\ndon’t you remember Ninetta?”\r\n\r\n“Ninetta! Do you remember when last we met?” I asked earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she murmured; “but do not speak of it. Such memories are painful.”\r\n\r\n“If to you, none the less to me, Ninetta,” I replied, looking into her\r\nsad, wan face.\r\n\r\nHer lips quivered, and tears stole down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nDuring a whole hour it was nothing but expressions of surprise and\r\nvague regret. To the depth of our beings we felt the voice of these\r\nrecollections. We were speaking of them, when suddenly she withdrew her\r\nhand, and a red flush mounted to her forehead.\r\n\r\n“But you soon forgot me when you went away,” she said reproachfully. “And\r\nI have never ceased to think of you. It was strange, playing a game of\r\ndominoes for your life, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\nI rose and gazed at her. She was seated, her eyes riveted on the dying\r\nembers of the fire, her cheek resting upon her hand, appearing to have\r\nforgotten my presence. There was nothing awkward in the long silence\r\nthat followed. We both felt too deeply for idle words. As we contemplated\r\nour past, the wind whistled without, the thunder pealed, and the rain\r\nfell furiously.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she exclaimed at last, looking up at me seriously, “I am foolish to\r\nspeak so, now that I am married.”\r\n\r\n“Married!” I gasped in astonishment, at the same time noticing the ring\r\nupon her finger. “I thought this cottage was your father’s—that you kept\r\nhouse for him.”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence. Then she spoke. Her voice made me tremble,\r\ncareless ingrate that I was. She uttered the words without moving, as\r\nthough giving utterance to the thought that possessed her. For an hour I\r\nremained talking to her, then went forth again into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe morning was chill and dull as I again walked along the beach-road\r\nuntil I came to the door of the cottage. I had spent a restless night;\r\nher misery tortured me, and despite her entreaty, I was now on my way to\r\nproffer assistance. With trepidation I approached the door of the humble\r\nabode, and knocked.\r\n\r\nNo one stirred. Everything seemed strangely silent.\r\n\r\nA moment later I noticed the door was unlatched. Pushing it open, I\r\nentered, at the same time uttering her name.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped into the neat, well-kept room I at first saw nothing, but\r\non glancing round the opposite side of the table my eyes encountered a\r\nsight that thrilled me with horror.\r\n\r\nStretched on the floor lay Ninetta, partially dressed, the pale morning\r\nlight falling across her calm, upturned features. Falling on my knees, I\r\ntouched her face with my hand. It was cold as marble. She was dead!\r\n\r\nIn her breast a knife was buried up to the hilt, and from the cruel wound\r\nthe blood had oozed, forming a dark pool beside her.\r\n\r\nMy recollection of the events immediately following this ghastly\r\ndiscovery is but faint. I have a hazy belief that my mind became\r\nunhinged; that I left the place without informing any one of the tragedy,\r\nthen walking many miles through woods and vineyards, I reached Ovada,\r\nwhence I took train for Turin.\r\n\r\nThe one thing most vivid in my mind was the terrible look of blank\r\ndespair in the glazed eyes.\r\n\r\nI have never forgotten it.\r\n\r\nOne dusty autumn day I was wandering in quaint, old-world Genoa, that\r\ncity which the bright-eyed, laughing Ligurians love to call “La Superba.”\r\nIt was in festá, and all the ladder-like streets were ablaze with flags,\r\nand the many-coloured façades of the old sea-palaces glowed in the fervid\r\nnoon-heat reflected by the sapphire water. It was the hour of the siesta.\r\nThe blazing sun beat down mercilessly upon the white streets; the shops\r\nwere closed, and behind green jalousies the Genoese were taking their\r\nnoon-day rest.\r\n\r\nPétroff was with me. Together we walked on the shady side of the deserted\r\nVia Roma, and having crossed the Piazza ’Nunziata, were passing the\r\nPalazzo di Giustizia, when a knot of persons talking excitedly attracted\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nA conversation we overheard between two soldiers aroused our curiosity\r\nas to a case in progress in the Criminal Court, and glad to seek shelter\r\nfrom the heat, we entered. As the soldier opened the swing-door of the\r\ncool, dimly lit court, I slipped inside with my companion. The judge had\r\nrisen, and was standing solemn and statuesque. Above him hung a great\r\ngilt crucifix. He was uttering words in Italian, that caused a sensation\r\nit was impossible to mistake.\r\n\r\n“Prisoner Lorenzo Bertini,” he said, addressing the wild-eyed looking man\r\nwho stood in fetters before him, “in this Court of Justice of His Majesty\r\nthe King you have been found guilty of wilfully murdering your wife\r\nNinetta, at Nervi. I therefore condemn you to death, and in the name of\r\nthe Almighty I call upon you to repent!”\r\n\r\nI held my breath, and fixed my gaze upon the unhappy man.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds I had sufficiently recovered to inquire of a young\r\npriest who stood beside me the nature of the tragedy. The condemned man,\r\nhe told me, had confessed that the motive of his crime was jealousy.\r\nHe was intoxicated, and having discovered his wife kissing a stranger\r\nwho had visited her in his absence, he had entered the house and\r\ndeliberately stabbed her to the heart.\r\n\r\nA sickening sensation crept over me. I pleaded that the intense heat\r\nhad brought on faintness, and we retraced our steps to our hotel. That\r\nevening we left Genoa, and a fortnight later I read in the _Secolo_ that\r\nLorenzo Bertini had paid the penalty of his crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF THE TRAITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPale yellow sunset had poured out its cold half-light upon the roofs, and\r\ngradually in the depths of the London streets everything grew grey and\r\ndim. In the clear deep blue the first star was already shining. Objects\r\nbegan to assume a disordered aspect, and melt away in the darkness.\r\nThe city, worn out with the vanity of the day, had become calm, as if\r\ngathering strength to pass the evening in the same vanity and turmoil.\r\n\r\nAlready the lights of the street lamps in Oakleigh Gardens were springing\r\nup, forming long, straight lines, as I drew down the blind and flung\r\nmyself into the inviting armchair before the cheerful fire. Taking from\r\nthe table an open letter written in cipher, I read it through by the\r\nflickering firelight. It was addressed to Pétroff, and ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Nicolas Kassatkin, who will arrive in London on Tuesday next, is a\r\ntrusted and valued member of our Circle at Novgorod. He has been twice\r\nimprisoned, first at Petropaulovsk, and secondly at Schlusselburg, whence\r\nhe has escaped. We are sending him to you because we are confident that\r\nhe can be of assistance. He is daring, enthusiastic, and speaks several\r\nlanguages. Being in possession of a private income, he will not need\r\nany financial help from the Executive. He will be the bearer of a note\r\nto you.—Signed, on behalf of the Novgorod Brothers of Freedom—SOLOMON\r\nGOLDSTEIN, ALEXANDER ROSTOVTZEFF.”\r\n\r\nI replaced it upon the table, and leaning back in the chair, smoked\r\nreflectively.\r\n\r\nHaving called to consult the Executive on some urgent business, Pétroff\r\nhad asked me to remain and welcome the newcomer. By repute I knew him as\r\na fearless Revolutionist, who had taken an active part in several plots\r\nwhich had for their object the removal of corrupt officials, and had been\r\nmore or less successful.\r\n\r\nI was plunged in reverie, induced perhaps by the dim, uncertain light of\r\nthe fire and the soothing properties of nicotine, when a loud ring at the\r\nhall-bell aroused me. Almost immediately afterwards I heard the voices of\r\nPétroff, Tersinski, and Grinevitch welcoming the stranger in Russian, and\r\na few moments later they entered and introduced him to me.\r\n\r\nWe shook hands cordially, and as Grinevitch lit the gas I saw that the\r\nstranger was a man of medium height, and about thirty years of age.\r\nHis face was of a rather low type. He had deep-set, grey eyes, with a\r\nfixed stare, a large, fair moustache, prominent cheek bones, and fair,\r\nlank, unkempt hair, while his deeply-furrowed brow spoke mutely of\r\nlong imprisonment and infinite pain and suffering. Removing his heavy\r\ntravelling-coat, he seated himself before the fire to thaw, at the same\r\ntime taking a letter from his pocket and handing it to Paul Pétroff.\r\n\r\nPresently we sat down to dinner together, and during the meal Kassatkin\r\nshowed himself to be an entertaining companion and vivacious talker.\r\nI sat next him, and he told us of the progress of the revolutionary\r\nmovement in Novgorod, declaring that there were unmistakable signs of\r\ngeneral upheaval, of an awakening of the public spirit, of patriotism,\r\nand of opposition, foreshadowing a coming struggle. He was bitter in his\r\ncondemnation of the dark deeds of the Tzar’s officials, and expressed an\r\nopinion that if Russia could tell something approaching to the full truth\r\nabout what was going on within her boundaries—the crimes committed in\r\ndarkness, the malversations practised, the real state of the exchequer,\r\nthe desperate tricks of the financiers—it would inflict upon the\r\nAutocracy a more severe blow than many conspiracies could strike.\r\n\r\n“Tell us of your escape,” I said, after he had related the story of his\r\narrest and imprisonment for carrying on propaganda among the soldiers of\r\nthe Novgorod garrison.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, his face brightening. “It has been a terrible\r\nexperience, but I was driven to desperation.” Turning to Pétroff he said:\r\n“You know the frightful horrors of Schlusselburg—the cold wet cells below\r\nthe water?”\r\n\r\n“I have, alas! much cause to remember them,” Paul answered, with a heavy\r\nsigh. “My wife, whom I loved so well, was imprisoned there at the same\r\ntime as myself. The solitary confinement and the horrors of her cell\r\ndrove her hopelessly insane. She is now an inmate of the criminal asylum\r\nat Krasnoje Selo.”\r\n\r\n“Madness is the fate of the majority of prisoners there,” said Kassatkin.\r\n“In my case the many months of absolute silence and lack of exercise\r\ndrove me into a state bordering on insanity. In order to check the\r\nimbecility that was slowly but surely taking possession of me, I used to\r\npace my damp, dark cell and compose verses. For days, weeks, months, I\r\nhad no other occupation than the composition of poems, which I afterwards\r\ncommitted to memory, having no writing materials. This was the only\r\nmental employment I had, and, although I grew strangely lightheaded,\r\nyet my self-imposed tasks prevented my mind becoming totally unhinged.\r\nAn opportunity for escape presented itself in a most unexpected manner.\r\nA large batch of ‘common law’ prisoners had been sent from Petersburg,\r\nand the prison being already over-crowded, I was removed from my cell\r\nand confined in a room in the fire-tower. It thus happened that I was\r\nlocked up in an ordinary room, with a window looking upon the bridge. It\r\nwas rather high, but it was near the waterpipe running along the wall\r\noutside, and there was a slanting roof of the lower storey which could\r\nbe utilised for the descent. I could not lose such an opportunity, and,\r\nin the dead of night, I opened the window and descended upon the bridge\r\nconnecting the prison with the bank, congratulating myself upon a happy\r\nescape.”\r\n\r\n“Were you discovered?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, almost immediately. By ill-luck a sentry noticed me and gave the\r\nalarm. It was an exciting moment as I made a dash for the forest and\r\ndisappeared among the trees. Half-a-dozen soldiers pursued me, but only\r\nfor a short distance, and apparently considering that they had a poor\r\nchance of capturing a fugitive in a forest, they returned to the prison\r\nfor assistance. I concealed myself and waited. Presently about twenty\r\nmounted soldiers galloped past along the forest road. When they were out\r\nof sight I left my hiding-place and walked on. My position was, however,\r\ncritical, therefore I returned to the Neva, as I could not lose my way\r\nbeside the river. I soon came to the water’s edge. By the opposite bank\r\nwere some islands and something like a lake or arm of the river, near\r\nwhich I could see what in the fog appeared to be masts. Close beside me\r\non the bank sat a group of fishermen, and a little way off an old man was\r\ndoing something to a boat. Having two or three roubles in my pocket, I\r\nwent up and asked the old man to ferry me across the river. He consented,\r\nbut asked in a conversational way why I wanted to go across. Remembering\r\nthe masts, I replied that I had to go on board a schooner that lay in the\r\ndistance. The old man looked at me suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“He asked who I was, and I told him that I was a working-man from\r\nTichvin. The old man put on a very suspicious air and began a minute\r\ninterrogation. I was at my wits’ end, and ready to make a dash for it;\r\nbut that was out of the question: the fishermen were close by and would\r\nhave caught me in five minutes. I resolved to take the bull by the horns,\r\nso I told the man that I had simply made up the former story, and that,\r\nin reality, I was an escaped political prisoner seeking a hiding-place.\r\nWhen the old man had asked me numerous other questions, he said: ‘Well,\r\nI won’t ferry you across myself, but I’ll tell my boy to. He’ll land you\r\non the island, and you can stop there until to-morrow night. You’re all\r\nright so far. Only, look here, don’t you go telling anybody that you\r\nhave to go to your schooner. In my young days there used to be plenty of\r\nschooners there, but for thirty years past there hasn’t been one near the\r\nplace.’\r\n\r\n“The old man then called a young fisherman, and told him to row me across\r\nto the island. On parting from the man who ferried me, I started to\r\nexplore the place, which I found to be very marshy. The morning broke wet\r\nand cheerless, and I spent the day in a disused hut. When evening set in,\r\nit became too cold for me to spend the night shelterless, and as I was\r\nsuffering severely from hunger, I wandered up and down the swampy forest\r\nlooking for a village. By the time I succeeded in finding one it was\r\nquite dark. I knocked at a cottage door, but the people would not let me\r\nin. I went to a second and third cottage, but with no success. Finally I\r\nlost my temper, and addressing an obdurate householder, asked him where\r\nthe _starosta_ lived.\r\n\r\n“The peasant directed me to the _starosta’s_ cottage, and then slammed\r\nhis door. I tapped at the door of the residence indicated, and it was\r\nopened by a woman. When I asked for the official I was in search of, she\r\nreplied, ‘I am the _starosta_. What do you want?’ It appeared that she\r\nreally was the _starosta_. The office was filled by all the peasants\r\nin the village in turn; and she, being an independent householder,\r\ntook her turn like the men. I rattled off a wild story, how I had come\r\nfor a holiday from Petersburg with some friends; how they had become\r\nintoxicated, and, for a practical joke, had returned home, leaving me\r\nalone on the island. The female _starosta_ evinced the warmest sympathy\r\nwith my misfortune, gave me supper, and allowed me to pass the night in\r\nher cottage.\r\n\r\n“Next morning I hired a boat, arrived safely in Petersburg, and found my\r\nfriends, who hid me for some time, while the police scoured the roads and\r\ncountry around Schlusselburg, and searched all the houses that appeared\r\nto them suspicious. When the excitement died down, I travelled as an\r\nordinary passenger to the frontier, and have now arrived here.”\r\n\r\nThat evening I took Kassatkin to live with me at my chambers, and\r\nfound him a pleasant, easy-going fellow, whose shrewdness proved most\r\nvaluable to me in the various matters upon which I was from time to time\r\nengaged. We went about a good deal, and made many friends. I had always\r\nbeen considered a fair amateur actor, and was prevailed upon to join a\r\nwell-known dramatic club which gave frequent performances at Kensington\r\nTown Hall.\r\n\r\nMany of my friends belonged to the club, and I found the rehearsals a\r\npleasant and amusing recreation, inasmuch as the people with whom I was\r\nbrought into contact were useful to me in a variety of ways. They knew I\r\nwas a foreigner, but believed me to be French, little suspecting that I\r\nwas a Nihilist.\r\n\r\nOne evening there had been a dress-rehearsal of a new comedy which we\r\nwere about to produce for copyright purposes. I was cast for the part of\r\nan affected English curate, one of the chief characters in the piece.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsal passed off satisfactorily, and it was nearly midnight\r\nwhen I left the hall and started on my walk homeward. I had a good\r\nhour’s tramp through the West End before me; but, as the night was clear\r\nand warm, I enjoyed the prospect rather than otherwise. As I walked\r\nalong Kensington Gore there was scarce a sound in the street, save the\r\noccasional tread of a policeman, or the hurried footfall of the belated\r\npleasure-seeker, breaking the stillness of the night suddenly, and then\r\ndying away in a succession of faint echoes.\r\n\r\nHad any friend met me I should scarcely have been recognised, from the\r\nfact that I was still in clerical attire, having dressed myself at\r\nhome to avoid trouble. I wore a long black coat of orthodox cut, black\r\nunmentionables, a clerical collar, a soft, wide-brimmed hat, and was\r\neffectually disguised, though I thought nothing of the circumstances at\r\nthe time, having frequently worn my stage clothes out of doors.\r\n\r\nI had walked for perhaps half an hour in silent contemplation, when\r\nI suddenly became aware that I had taken a wrong turning and that my\r\nfootsteps had involuntarily carried me into that patrician of Kensington\r\nthoroughfares, Cromwell Road.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I was passing a large, handsome-looking house, the outward\r\nappearance of which had an unmistakable air of wealth. The other houses\r\nwere in darkness, but several of the windows of this one were brilliantly\r\nlit.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard something that caused me to pause. It sounded like a\r\nlong, shrill scream.\r\n\r\nA moment later the door was opened by a man-servant, who ran hurriedly\r\ndown the steps. As he confronted me he stopped short, and peering into my\r\nface, said—\r\n\r\n“Sir, would you have the kindness to step inside for a few minutes. His\r\nlordship sent me to look for a gentleman, and it is fortunate I found one\r\nso near.”\r\n\r\n“A gentleman!” I exclaimed, astonished. “But I——”\r\n\r\n“His lordship’s daughter is dying, sir, and he told me to get the first\r\ngentleman I could find.”\r\n\r\nThe man led the way up the steps, and, dumbfounded by the sudden manner\r\nin which I had been accosted, I followed.\r\n\r\nHe ushered me into a small but very elegantly furnished room, and then\r\nwent to find his master. Just at that moment I heard the footsteps of\r\ntwo other men, who apparently entered from the street and walked down\r\nthe hall to the room adjoining the one in which I was. I had hardly\r\ntime to look about me, when the servant returned, accompanied by a\r\nstrange-looking old man. He was well dressed, but seemed out of place\r\nin the clothes he wore. Small and thin, he had snow-white hair, sunken\r\ncheeks, and eyes in which shone a peculiar lustre. The manner in which\r\nhe advanced to greet me was strange, for he seemed to glide noiselessly\r\nacross the room. His face was colourless, and would have seemed almost\r\ndevoid of life had it not been for his restless, glittering eyes.\r\n\r\n“His lordship,” explained the servant.\r\n\r\nI bowed, and the man retired. For a moment the old gentleman’s eyes\r\nshifted and roved, then he fixed my gaze with them, and said slowly, in a\r\nsqueaky voice—\r\n\r\n“I have a theory that everything may be purchased; that every man has his\r\nprice. Do you agree with me?”\r\n\r\nI was surprised. I shrank from him, and despised and hated him.\r\n\r\n“Most things can undoubtedly be bought; but not everything,” I replied.\r\n\r\nHe smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n“Of course, neither life nor intellect can be purchased; but the securing\r\nof any service from any person capable of performing it is merely a\r\nquestion of money.”\r\n\r\nI nodded approbation of this remark, wondering what service he needed at\r\nmy hands.\r\n\r\n“I am quite at my wits’ end, and I require a small service from you,” he\r\nsaid suddenly, as a look of blank, unutterable despair swept over his\r\nface. He looked wearied and despondent; I pitied him.\r\n\r\n“If I can render you that service I shall be pleased,” I replied.\r\n\r\nHis face brightened; the haggard expression vanished.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he said. “It is perhaps a strange request, still I can find\r\nmany men who will be only too eager to accept my offer.”\r\n\r\n“But I am not——”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” he interrupted; “allow me to explain. I am the Earl of\r\nWansford.”\r\n\r\nI gave vent to an ejaculation of surprise, for the Earl was a well-known\r\nfigure in the diplomatic world, and until three years ago had been\r\nBritish Ambassador to Russia. He smiled as he noticed my astonishment,\r\nand continued—\r\n\r\n“I have but one daughter, who, alas! is dying. The physicians say hers is\r\na hopeless case, and I desire that her last moments shall be made happy.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you want me to attend at the bedside and minister words of\r\nconsolation. I am sorry I cannot——”\r\n\r\n“No,” he snarled, “she is religious enough, and does not require you in\r\nthat capacity.”\r\n\r\n“But surely a dying person, whether prepared for the next world or not,\r\nshould see a clergyman!” I said.\r\n\r\n“True; but Muriel is insane,” he replied. “You remember what I said a\r\nminute ago, that it is only a question of money to any man?”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Why, marriage.”\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. I could not comprehend his meaning.\r\n\r\n“But what do you want of me?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“A trifling service. You can perform it now; but if you refuse, you will\r\nalways regret.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what it is, and I will give my answer.”\r\n\r\n“It is this. Some time ago—perhaps about three years—while we were\r\nliving in St. Petersburg, I became ill, and was obliged to go to the\r\nSouth of France. During my absence my daughter met a Russian for whom\r\nshe conceived a violent fancy. Since I returned and brought her home to\r\nEngland, she has done nothing but mope and mourn for him, with the result\r\nthat her intellect is impaired.”\r\n\r\n“But will not the man marry her?” I asked, interested in the romance.\r\n\r\n“He disappeared mysteriously, and although I have made the most strenuous\r\nefforts to trace him, he cannot be found. Of course she would marry him\r\nif she could; but her mental faculties are so weak that she would marry\r\nany one else and believe it to be him. But here’s the point——”\r\n\r\nHe felt in his pocket, and producing a wallet, took from it a roll of\r\nclean crisp Bank of England notes. He counted twenty of them, each for\r\none hundred pounds, and held them towards me.\r\n\r\n“These are yours,” he said slowly, “if you will consent to be my\r\ndaughter’s husband!”\r\n\r\nThe strange proposal caused me to gasp. Two thousand pounds! Did ever\r\ntemptation stand in man’s path in a more alluring guise? I had but\r\nlittle money of my own, and with this sum I could do many things.\r\n\r\nHere was a dying girl whose passage to the grave would be rendered\r\nbrighter by my marrying her; who would die in a few days, or weeks at\r\nmost, and know no difference. Nobody need be aware of this strange\r\nmidnight adventure, or the manner in which I had been bought. I hesitated.\r\n\r\n“I give you my word that none know of her insanity except myself, and\r\nthat she is upon her death-bed,” said my tempter.\r\n\r\nStill I paused. I was wondering what could be the Earl’s ulterior motive.\r\nBesides, I had no desire to enter the ranks of Benedicts.\r\n\r\n“Come, decide. I have a clergyman ready and a licence. Some one shall\r\nmake my darling’s last moments happy. Is not the money enough? Well,\r\nhere’s another thousand. Will you accept it?”\r\n\r\nI summoned courage, and drawing a long breath, stretched forth my hand\r\nand grasped the notes, which I thrust hastily into my pocket.\r\n\r\nI had sold myself. I had offered myself as a sacrifice to Mammon, as\r\nothers had done. My purchaser opened the door, and called softly, “It’s\r\nall right.”\r\n\r\n“Is it?” asked the clergyman who entered. “You are, I understand, the\r\naffianced husband of Lady Muriel?” he asked, addressing me.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied. Was it not true? Had I not three thousand pounds in my\r\npocket as evidence of the fact?\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the old man impatiently, as he led the way upstairs to a\r\nlarge bedroom on the first floor, where the light was so dim that I could\r\nhardly more than distinguish the shape of the bed and the form of some\r\none closely covered up in it. The footman, who had accosted me in the\r\nstreet, entered behind us, and we took our places at the bedside.\r\n\r\nGradually, as my eyes grew accustomed to the semi-darkness, I could see\r\nthat my future wife was lying upon her side, and with her face turned\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n“Take her hand,” commanded the man to whom I had sold myself.\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\n“Proceed with the ceremony.”\r\n\r\nThe clergyman droned off the service by heart with the characteristic\r\nnasal intonation. Probably I faltered a little at the responses, but my\r\ndying bride never hesitated. Though her voice was low as distant music,\r\nher every word was prompt and clear.\r\n\r\nI gave the _alias_ I frequently used, Vladimir Mordvinoff, and when I\r\nuttered the name I fancied that she started.\r\n\r\n“_Mojnoli?_” she gasped in a strange half-whisper, but she did not turn\r\nto look at me. It was evident, however, that she spoke Russian.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony concluded, we were pronounced man and wife; I was the\r\nhusband of a girl who was insane, and whose face I had never looked upon!\r\n\r\nWas ever there a stranger marriage? The thin wasted fingers that lay\r\nin my grasp were cold. A strange sense of guilt crept over me when I\r\nremembered that I had bound myself irrevocably to her, deceiving her\r\nduring her last moments upon earth.\r\n\r\n“Come,” exclaimed his lordship. “Let us go downstairs and sign the\r\nnecessary documents.”\r\n\r\nWe all descended to the library, where the register was filled up and\r\nthe signatures affixed, the clergyman handing me the certificate with a\r\nmurmur of congratulation. A bottle of champagne was produced, and we each\r\ndrank a glass, after which I was allowed to return to the room alone to\r\nmake the acquaintance of my wife.\r\n\r\nI entered on tiptoe, almost breathlessly, and paused for a moment beside\r\nthe bed, trying to speak. At first my mouth refused to utter a sound.\r\nWhat could I say? Suddenly the Nihilist pass-word flashed across my\r\nmind, and I uttered it. It’s effect was almost magical. Struggling, she\r\nendeavoured to rise, but could only support herself upon her elbow, at\r\nthe same time giving me the secret countersign.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to see her countenance, so I turned up the gas, afterwards\r\nbending down to look upon her. It was a pretty, delicate face, but cut\r\nand swollen as if by savage blows, discoloured and disfigured, a blanched\r\nface in which were obvious signs of insanity!\r\n\r\nWhen our eyes met she started, scrutinised me closely, and uttered a\r\nshrill scream of joy.\r\n\r\nI recognised her instantly. While I was living in Petersburg several\r\nyears before, she had been admitted to our Circle. She gave the name\r\nof Muriel Radford, but beyond the fact that she was English and that\r\nshe apparently had plenty of money at her disposal, we knew nothing of\r\nher. At the meetings of the Circle we often met and had many a pleasant\r\n_tête-à-tête_. I had admired her and more than once was tempted to\r\ndeclare my love, but I refrained from doing so until too late, for\r\nsuddenly, one snowy night in midwinter, I was compelled to fly from the\r\nRussian capital. Since then I had neither seen nor heard of her.\r\n\r\nNow I had discovered her under these extraordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nShe kissed me fondly, passionately, and I was about to explain our\r\nstrange marriage, when the terrible light of insanity in her eyes caused\r\nme to hesitate. Of what use was it to speak? She did not understand.\r\n\r\nTaking a small bunch of keys from under her lace-edged pillow, she handed\r\nthem to me, saying—\r\n\r\n“Go to that cabinet over there and unlock the second drawer. In the\r\nright-hand corner you will find a packet. Bring it here and open it.”\r\n\r\nI did as I was commanded, and brought to the bedside a small packet of\r\nletters secured with crimson ribbon. As I untied the knot a cabinet\r\nphotograph fell out upon the bed. I picked it up and looked at it.\r\n\r\nIt was a picture of myself!\r\n\r\n“How did you obtain this?” I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I have never ceased to think of you,” she replied. “I prevailed upon\r\none of your friends in Petersburg to give me the picture. But there is\r\nanother photograph there. Take it out and look at it.”\r\n\r\nSearching among the papers, I found the picture she indicated.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned it face upwards in the gaslight it almost fell from my\r\ngrasp, for I recognised it as a portrait of my companion with whom I\r\nshared chambers.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Kassatkin?” I asked, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” she said, and raising herself upon her elbow, she continued\r\nearnestly: “Listen, Anton! You are now my husband, although I know I am\r\ndying. Nothing can save me, and I shall not live to inflict upon that\r\ncursed spy the punishment he deserves. I know——”\r\n\r\n“Is he a spy?” I interrupted breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. When you had left Petersburg they admitted him into the Circle,\r\nbelieving him to be trustworthy. Soon afterwards, however, the police\r\narrested nearly the whole of the members, and had I not been the\r\ndaughter of the British ambassador I should have been arrested also.\r\nInquiries I afterwards made proved conclusively that Paramòn Markoff—or\r\nNicolas Kassatkin, as he calls himself—was an officer of Secret Police;\r\nthat he was admitted to the Circle by means of forged introductions, and\r\nthat through his instrumentality over one hundred members of our Cause\r\nwere exiled.”\r\n\r\n“But what proof have you?” I asked excitedly, remembering how much\r\nKassatkin knew of the conspiracy we were forming.\r\n\r\n“The papers you hold in your hand will prove what I allege,” she replied.\r\nThen she continued wildly: “Find the spy. Let death be his reward for\r\ningenuity and double-dealing. Kill him! Promise me! Do not let him send\r\nto Siberia other innocent supporters of the Cause!” Clutching my hand,\r\nshe added, “Tell me that you will avenge the deaths of the men and women\r\nwho fell victims to his treachery. Promise me!”\r\n\r\n“I promise,” I replied. “If he is a spy he shall die.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! At last he will receive his well-merited punishment. And he had the\r\naudacity to love me!” She uttered the words feebly, sinking wearily back\r\nupon her pillow.\r\n\r\nHer face had changed, becoming paler and more drawn. She did not move,\r\nand I stood watching, not knowing what to do. The excitement had proved\r\ntoo much for her. Suddenly she opened her eyes, and whispered my name.\r\nThen she gave vent to a long, deep-drawn sigh, shuddered, and lay\r\nstrangely still.\r\n\r\nI knew then that my wife had passed away!\r\n\r\nI was kissing her pale lips and closing the glazing eyes, when the\r\nfootman entered hurriedly, and whispered that I was required in the\r\nlibrary at once. He dashed downstairs, and I followed. On going into the\r\nroom a sight met my gaze which I shall never forget, for, lying stretched\r\nupon the couch was his lordship, writhing in the horrible agonies of\r\ndeath from poisoning. A small bottle standing upon the table and a broken\r\nchampagne glass had but one tale to tell.\r\n\r\nHe had taken his own life!\r\n\r\nThe clergyman was kneeling by his side, but in a few moments the old Earl\r\ngave a final sigh, and ere I had realised it, he passed to the land that\r\nlies beyond human ken.\r\n\r\nI learned from the doctor who attended that the Earl of Wansford had,\r\nsince relinquishing his post at Petersburg, showed signs of madness.\r\nDuring a fit of insanity, a year before, he had struck down his daughter,\r\ninflicting such injuries that she had been an invalid ever since. Her\r\nmind, too, became unhinged. It was supposed that, seized by sudden\r\nremorse, his lordship had imbibed the fatal draught.\r\n\r\nMorning was breaking, cold and grey, as I ascended the stairs to\r\nmy chambers. Opening the door with my latch-key, I entered the\r\nsitting-room. The lamp was still burning, and there were evidences that\r\nKassatkin had not returned.\r\n\r\nUpon the table was a note addressed to me.\r\n\r\nI tore it open, and read as follows:—\r\n\r\n“In the matter upon which we were engaged last week I have made an\r\nimportant discovery, which necessitates me leaving for the Continent\r\nto-night. Will let you know shortly where I am.”\r\n\r\nIt suddenly crossed my mind that, having ascertained the details of the\r\nplot we were preparing, he had left for Petersburg to give information to\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nThat morning I placed the papers my dead wife had given me before the\r\nExecutive, and the same evening Tersinski and I, having discovered the\r\nroute the spy had taken, were on our way to the Continent, following the\r\nman upon whom the sentence of our Order had been passed.\r\n\r\nA week later the special edition of the _Pall Mall Gazette_ contained the\r\nfollowing among its general foreign news:—\r\n\r\n“Reuter’s Cologne correspondent reports that a mysterious murder has\r\ncreated considerable sensation in Germany. Yesterday the body of a man\r\nwas discovered floating in the Rhine, near Bonn, and on being taken from\r\nthe water it was found that the man had been stabbed to the heart. From\r\npapers found upon him, it appears that the name of the murdered man was\r\nNicolas Kassatkin, a Russian, who has recently been living in London.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAN IKON OATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIvan Liustig was not like any one else. His friends of the Petersburg\r\nCircle were conscious of some lack of foundation beneath the graceful\r\nsuperstructure of his character. But they did not array themselves, as\r\nhis critics, against him. They smiled at him, but they loved him.\r\n\r\nSince he had escaped with me after the wrecking of the Tzar’s train near\r\nBorki, he had returned to Russia, whither I had also gone with Bounakoff\r\nupon a secret quest.\r\n\r\nWhen, in Petersburg, I heard of him as investigating psychical phenomena\r\nas encoiled in psychology, it seemed another versatile phase at which\r\nagain to smile. For Ivan, who was an enthusiastic medical student, was\r\nsure to have, here, as elsewhere, some exceptional experiences; was sure\r\nto pour out the recital of the same in due time to his chosen associates\r\nwith a fulness of picturesque detail that shed a new light on all the\r\nquestion involved. But when it appeared that it was not psychical\r\nresearch in the abstract, but a feminine psychist in the concrete that\r\nheld Ivan in thrall, there was an altered feeling inducing a graver view.\r\n\r\n“I hope all this we hear is an airy joke,” I said to him one day after a\r\nmeeting of the Circle. He honoured me, as his elder, with some deference\r\nin his friendship; and the quality of the latter sentiment had been\r\nexceptionally warm between us since our journey together in the Imperial\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me steadily with his handsome blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“You must know well enough. They say that you are spending all your\r\nleisure with some shady female, who, at one and the same time, expounds\r\nspirits, magnetic psychology, and exploits the pockets of the credulous.”\r\n\r\nTo my surprise he turned very pale.\r\n\r\n“Were you not one of my best friends, Anton, I’d knock you down for that.”\r\n\r\n“By the Virgin, you’re lost!” I cried.\r\n\r\nI was about to turn away on my heel, but he drew me back. His anger had\r\nbeen appeased.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind me,” he said in his tractable, normal tone. “But don’t\r\njoin the herd of fools who won’t understand. I looked for sympathy and\r\ncomprehension from you. You can’t judge till you know her—till you know\r\nthis wonderful—most wonderful woman.”\r\n\r\n“I daresay,” I assented dryly. “Who, however, and what is she?”\r\n\r\n“She is half Russian, half German, and wholly a citizen of the world.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I know the type—”\r\n\r\n“You know nothing!” he exclaimed, flushing angrily. “But”—he shrugged his\r\nshoulders—“the prejudices of the world count for—what? Nothing at all.\r\nThe curse of the Philistine is his Philistinism.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Forget what I have said. I approach the Russo-German in the\r\nproperly reverential spirit to apprehend the phenomena. They say she is\r\nyoung and pretty. And what, especially, does she do?”\r\n\r\n“You may see, some day.” His gaze grew bright, soft, and vague, as one\r\nwho catches a glimpse of the floating garments of supernatural mysteries.\r\n“Ah! she is wonderful. She is charming!”\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after this that I obtained an introduction to Ivan\r\nLiustig’s goddess. She lived in the Vosseressenski quarter, on the third\r\nfloor of a tall house, but with a degree of relative elegance that argued\r\neither some personal means or a thriving trade. I had expected to see\r\nan electric, opalescent person, with rouged face and a Cleopatra manner\r\ncalculated to enmesh the unwary. I met instead a little blonde woman with\r\ngreat eyes, soft as black pearls and limpid as a brook. I had understood\r\nfrom Ivan that she had been married and widowed. But with her loops of\r\nflaxen braid tied deftly with ribbon, she looked no more matured than a\r\nschoolgirl. Her dress, from head to foot, was tasteful and pleasing, but\r\nof the simplest. And she had a way, after she had greeted you, of sitting\r\nupon the edge of chairs and sofas and listening in grave-eyed confidence\r\nthat made you think of some precocious child forced, through the loss\r\nof its natural protectors, to face the blackness of an unfamiliar world\r\nalone. She was introduced as Wanda Waluiski.\r\n\r\n“Your friend tells me that you are interested in psychical phenomena,”\r\nshe said to me, after a few moments. “But I fear I can show you nothing\r\nmuch to-night. The conditions do not seem favourable, somehow.”\r\n\r\nI made a murmur of regret.\r\n\r\n“Are these things dependent on atmospheric conditions?”\r\n\r\n“To a certain degree. But other obstacles step in—opposing mental\r\nattitudes and currents.” She passed her hands over her eyes as she spoke,\r\nas if to rid herself of some invisible oppression.\r\n\r\n“A common charlatan, after all,” said I to myself. “She sees I am\r\nsceptical of the validity of her claims and that prevents the full\r\noperation of the trickery.”\r\n\r\nIvan ardently assured her that it was of no moment; that we would return\r\nanother day. Wanda was silent for an instant, and I had begun to think\r\nher manner at least peculiar, when she turned her eyes full upon me.\r\n\r\n“I ought not to let you come here again,” was her extraordinary remark.\r\n“I have been warned this moment, I was warned the moment you entered the\r\nroam that unhappiness must come to me through you. But one’s earthly fate\r\ncannot be fought against. My forbidding you to come here would not delay\r\nor turn aside the onward march of events.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you I have no wish to inflict an unwelcome presence upon you,”\r\nI hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n“No—no.” Her pale, child-like face was overspread with a strange air of\r\nweariness. “All we can do is of no use. Come. Come when you choose.”\r\n\r\nWhen we were in the street Ivan broke out in apologies, urging that I\r\nshould not feel myself insulted.\r\n\r\n“I do not feel insulted,” I said. “In fact, I find Madame Waluiski much\r\nmore interesting than I expected.”\r\n\r\nAnd this was truth. If she were an impostor, an adventuress, I had been\r\nimpressed with the fact that she was one clever enough to be worthy of\r\nstudy. But again, how doubt a personality apparently so unlike that of a\r\ntrickster, a face so transparent, a whole being so unusual, so ingenuous?\r\n\r\nI knew not what to think.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scene was, perhaps, one of the most picturesque in Petersburg. After\r\nthe dust and heat of the August day Mascha, Bounakoff, and myself were\r\nsitting at dinner in the beautiful Gardens of Catherinenhoff. With the\r\nsunset a cool wind had sprung up from the Neva, rendering Andrejeff’s\r\nRestaurant an exceedingly pleasant retreat under the clear sky and\r\nbrilliant stars. At one of the small _al fresco_ tables we were in the\r\nfull enjoyment of our meal. It was a band night, and those who have\r\nvisited the Russian capital know how upon such occasions the Gardens are\r\nilluminated and the tables filled by a fashionable throng of men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIvan was sitting at the next table, and we had invited him to join\r\nus, but as he had already finished his dinner he was waiting until we\r\ncommenced to smoke.\r\n\r\nThose of my readers who have refreshed themselves at Andrejeff’s will\r\nremember that one of the tables is placed against a large trellis\r\ncovered with tangled masses of creepers, which screens it from the gaze\r\nof passers-by, and makes it a very cosy nook. It was here that Ivan sat\r\nalone, contemplatively smoking a cigarette and sipping from the glass\r\nof port beside him, while at our table we chaffed and laughed merrily\r\ntogether. Conversation was general, and the hearty laughter and gay tones\r\nof French voices mingled with the guttural exclamations of the Tzar’s\r\nsubjects as they walked under the linden trees beside the lake, while\r\never and anon a burst of military music reached us from over the water.\r\n\r\nAs I sat watching the crowd of promenaders two figures that passed\r\nengaged my attention. Why, I cannot tell. One was that of a lady,\r\napparently about forty years of age, good-looking, well-preserved, and\r\nattired fashionably in a black jet-trimmed evening dress, with a lace\r\nmantilla over her head. Alone, she walked past slowly and deliberately,\r\nat the same time casting a searching glance in our direction. In the\r\ndim half-light I could see she was undeniably handsome, but in a few\r\nmoments she had passed out of my sight, and I, joining in my companions’\r\nconversation, forgot her.\r\n\r\nThe other figure which followed some minutes later was that of Wanda\r\nWaluiski.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later a lad, son of the _dvornik_ at Ivan’s lodging,\r\nbrought him some letters, being accompanied by his sister, a bright\r\nlittle girl of ten. The student complimented the child on the way she was\r\ndressed, patted her upon the cheek, and gave her some grapes, rewarding\r\nthe lad with a few kopecks. Then the girl laughed pleasantly, displaying\r\nan even row of white teeth, afterwards making a dignified little bow, and\r\nturning away with her brother.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely gone when we were startled by a terrible cry.\r\n\r\nTurning quickly, we saw that Ivan had risen from his chair, his face\r\nflushed and distorted. One hand grasped his wine-glass, while the other\r\nclutched convulsively at his throat, for he was choking.\r\n\r\nStaggering a few uneven steps towards us, he stumbled. The glass fell\r\nfrom his nerveless fingers, and was shattered. We sat speechless in\r\nsurprise and alarm.\r\n\r\nHis face became blanched in a moment, and he passed his hand across his\r\nagonised brow.\r\n\r\n“Ah!—Heaven!” he gasped with great effort. “You fellows—my wine!—can’t\r\nyou see?—I—I’m poisoned!”\r\n\r\nWith one accord we sprang to our feet and rushed towards him, but before\r\nwe could stretch forth our hands he had staggered forward with a loud cry\r\nand fallen heavily upon the gravel.\r\n\r\nOur endeavours to raise him were useless.\r\n\r\n“Let me alone!” he shouted hoarsely. “The poison—was put into my\r\nglass—through the trellis! You cannot save me. Ah! I—I’m dying! The\r\ncowards have killed me!”\r\n\r\nI knelt and raised his head upon my arm.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch me!” he cried. “Can’t you let me die?” Writhing in paroxysms\r\nof intense pain, his face livid, his body horribly distorted, he ground\r\nhis teeth and foamed at the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe sight was awful; yet we were utterly powerless.\r\n\r\nA violent trembling suddenly shook his whole frame, and his palsied limbs\r\nstretched themselves out rigidly in the final struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nThen he gasped. The breath left his body, and he lay pale and motionless\r\nunder the starlight. Ivan Liustig was dead!\r\n\r\nSo quickly had all this happened, that scarcely any one had been\r\nattracted. As we lifted the body and carried it tenderly into the\r\nrestaurant the strains of the “_Boje Zara chrani_,” floating over the\r\nlake, formed a jarring, incongruous dirge to our silent, sorrowful\r\n_cortège_.\r\n\r\nA doctor was quickly procured, but as soon as he touched him he removed\r\nhis hat respectfully, and pronounced him beyond human aid. I handed him\r\nthe pieces of broken glass which I had picked from the gravelled walk. He\r\nsmelt them, and finding a drop of wine remaining, dipped the tip of his\r\nlittle finger into it, and placed it upon his tongue.\r\n\r\n“Strychnine,” he remarked. “Without a doubt.”\r\n\r\nReverently they covered the body with a tablecloth, and it was\r\nsubsequently conveyed away.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to refer in detail to the events that immediately\r\nfollowed. That Ivan had been murdered in the most cowardly and secret\r\nmanner possible was plain, but the identity of the person who had\r\nplaced the poison in the glass from the opposite side of the trellis\r\nwas a mystery. The police quickly apprehended the _dvornik’s_ son and\r\ndaughter, both of whom were submitted to a searching cross-examination.\r\nThere was such an utter absence of motive, however, and so plain and\r\nstraightforward were their answers, that the officials were quickly\r\nconvinced of their innocence.\r\n\r\nBut I had my own suspicions. Later that night I took a _drosky_ to the\r\nVosseressenski quarter and sought the dead man’s idol, intending to break\r\nthe news to her, and closely observe the manner in which she received it.\r\n\r\nWanda Waluiski, when I entered, was sitting alone, dressed in semi-loose\r\ndrapery of white, that made her child-like figure seem only the more\r\nyouthful under the light of the bright lamp. Her eyes met mine instantly\r\nas I came in, and their gaze had a fulness of significance I could not\r\nfathom. I offered her my hand.\r\n\r\n“I never shake the hand of any one,” she observed gently, not moving her\r\nown. “It induces loss of power in psychic sensitives.”\r\n\r\nI was looking into her weirdly delicate visage, with its large eyes\r\nwhose expression was so haunting, and a certain thrill of quickened zest\r\nsuddenly replaced the sensation of repugnance in my mind.\r\n\r\n“I have come to break bad news to you,” I said gently.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she replied. “I—I am aware that Ivan is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you?” I asked quickly, but my inquiry was not answered.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door was flung open unceremoniously, and two police\r\nofficers entered.\r\n\r\n“Wanda Waluiski,” exclaimed the elder of the two, advancing towards her,\r\n“I arrest you, in the name of our Father the Tzar, for the murder of one\r\nIvan Liustig!”\r\n\r\n“For murder!” she gasped, half-rising from her chair. “I—I am innocent!”\r\n\r\n“Upon whose information do you make the arrest?” I asked.\r\n\r\nThe officer referred to the paper in his hand, and replied: “One Mascha\r\nPrèhznev alleges that this woman placed the poison in the victim’s glass.”\r\n\r\n“My sister!” I exclaimed involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Wanda, who had risen and stood stern and haggard before me. “I\r\ntold you on the first occasion you visited me that unhappiness must come\r\nto me through you.” Turning quickly towards the gilded _ikon_ upon the\r\nwall, she crossed herself reverently, murmuring, “Before Heaven, I swear\r\nI am innocent!”\r\n\r\nThen she took up her fur-lined cloak lying upon the couch, and throwing\r\nit about her shoulders, drew the hood over her head and announced her\r\nreadiness to accompany the officers. As they were about to descend the\r\nstairs two police spies in civilian dress entered and received orders\r\nto search the place. I remained behind in order to ascertain what was\r\ndiscovered, but after an hour’s investigation they had to acknowledge the\r\nabsence of any clue.\r\n\r\nDuring the time they were rummaging in holes and corners I chanced to\r\ntake up a photograph album, and was looking casually through it when my\r\neyes fell upon a cabinet portrait of a well-preserved, handsomely attired\r\nwoman, evidently moving in fashionable society.\r\n\r\nIn a moment I recognised it as the counterfeit presentment of the woman\r\nI had seen strolling in the Catherinenhoff Gardens almost immediately\r\nbefore I had noticed Wanda! I closed the album and kept the discovery to\r\nmyself. Within an hour I saw Mascha, and asked her upon what grounds she\r\nhad given the information that had led to the mysterious Wanda’s arrest.\r\n\r\n“She loved Ivan and was my rival,” she replied, shrugging her shoulders.\r\n“I saw her emerge from behind the trellis. That is all the proof I have.”\r\n\r\nI pointed out that the allegations were of so serious a character that,\r\nin all probability, Wanda would be kept in prison while the matter was\r\nbeing investigated, which would certainly be several months, perhaps\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n“But she stole him from me,” my sister replied, with flashing eyes. “She\r\nwill now have to prove her innocence.”\r\n\r\nI could see that Mascha was revengeful, and that all argument was useless.\r\n\r\nThe murder created a good deal of sensation in Petersburg; and, as I had\r\nanticipated, Wanda was confined in the grim fortress of Peter and Paul.\r\nDays, weeks, months passed, but she was not brought before the Court—the\r\npolice were still investigating. At length, after nearly seven months\r\nhad gone by, the case was brought to trial, and the accused was acquitted.\r\n\r\nStrange how Fate directs our course through life. It was about a year\r\nafterwards. I had returned to London, and drifting into journalistic\r\nwork, was representing a certain daily newspaper, that shall be nameless,\r\nin the gallery of the House of Commons. I had a reason for entering\r\njournalism, but that has nothing to do with the present story.\r\n\r\nThe hour was midnight. The Speaker had ordered a division upon an\r\nimportant question affecting Ireland, and honourable members, stretching\r\nthemselves, had risen wearily and were strolling out to vote. Many of\r\nmy _confrères_ had flung down their pens and made for the Press bar;\r\nbut I was busy. The debate had been almost historical, for, in answer\r\nto the objections of the Opposition, Mr. Balfour had made a brilliant\r\nand telling reply, therefore I was unfortunately compelled to continue\r\nwriting, and that at express speed.\r\n\r\nThe _frou-frou_ of silk, mingled with frivolous feminine laughter, caused\r\nme to look upward. The ladies’ gallery is over that devoted to the Press,\r\nand somewhat in the rear, being irreverently termed the “gridiron,”\r\nbecause feminine beauty is hidden from the curious gaze of honourable\r\nmembers by ornamental iron-work. From the side seats, however, we\r\nobtained a good view of the fair ones who came to hear their husbands,\r\nfathers, and lovers descant upon their country’s ills, and as I glanced\r\nup, I saw two faces behind the iron bars peering down upon the half-empty\r\nbenches.\r\n\r\nOne was that of an elderly white-haired lady, evidently a patrician. The\r\nother was younger, and her features struck me as strangely familiar.\r\nWhere could I have seen her before? I tried to think, but, with\r\ntantalising contrariness, my memory refused to answer. Yet I felt a\r\ncurious desire to remember who she was. It was almost like a presage of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nI looked again. Her eyes met mine in a cold, haughty stare, but in a\r\nsecond I had recollected her. She was the woman I had noticed in the\r\nCatherinenhoff Gardens!\r\n\r\nMy pen almost fell from my grasp.\r\n\r\nAlthough I felt positive I had not mistaken the face, yet I admit the\r\nidentification was so sudden that I found myself doubting whether it was\r\nreally the woman I had seen in the dimly illuminated grounds.\r\n\r\n“Campbell,” I said, beckoning one of the attendants, “there’s a lady\r\nupstairs with blue birds in her hat. Don’t notice her for a moment, but\r\nlook up presently and tell me if you know who she is.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sir,” he replied with a significant smile, arranging his gilt\r\nchain of office over his glossy shirt-front, and strolling away along the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nReturning in a few moments, he bent over me and exclaimed, “That lady,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said anxiously.\r\n\r\n“She’s Mrs. Elworthy, wife of the Member for North-west Huntingdon. She’s\r\nwell known in society, and comes as regularly when her husband speaks as\r\nMrs. Gladstone does.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Elworthy!” I ejaculated. “Ah, thanks,” I added.\r\n\r\nRemarking that I was welcome to the information, Campbell walked away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elworthy! My thoughts were only of her. I knew her by reputation as\r\na leader of fashion; the centre of a dashing set. She joked pleasantly\r\nwith her elder companion, uttering a low, musical laugh. The diamonds on\r\nher slim wrist sparkled as the daintily gloved hand grasped the iron-work.\r\n\r\nI was watching that hand surreptitiously, when a strange thought occurred\r\nto me. I wondered whether it was the same that had reached through the\r\ncreeper-covered trellis in Petersburg two years before!\r\n\r\nBut as these grave thoughts took possession of me, the “House” filled,\r\nthe tellers advanced to the table, and the result of the division was\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nI went out to hand it to my telegraphist in the lobby. When I returned\r\nthe object of my thoughts had gone. It was certainly a curious\r\ncoincidence that we should thus meet, yet what proof had I that she was\r\na murderess? Nothing beyond a strange, fitful fancy.\r\n\r\nIn a handsome drawing-room in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, where the\r\nwintry twilight filtered through pale-blue silk curtains, I was, about\r\ntwo months later, sitting alone with Mrs. Elworthy.\r\n\r\nThrough a friend of the family I had succeeded in obtaining an\r\nintroduction to her, and now regularly received cards for all her\r\nlittle festivities. Both she and her husband welcomed me warmly\r\nwhenever I called, and very soon I found myself one of a very pleasant,\r\nif extravagant set. I made, however, two discoveries of a somewhat\r\nremarkable character. Firstly, that Mrs. Elworthy was a Russian, and,\r\nsecondly, that the fascinating girl I had known as Wanda Waluiski was\r\nliving with her, and was, in reality, her daughter!\r\n\r\nOn this particular afternoon I had remained behind after the other\r\nvisitors had departed, and was chatting with Mrs. Elworthy, who, with all\r\na woman’s cunning, had chosen a _vieux rose_ tea-gown, which, falling in\r\nartistic folds, gave sculptural relief to her almost angular outline.\r\n\r\nFor a woman, she was unusually conversant with political questions, and\r\nI had purposely turned our discussion upon the prevalence of famine in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n“Were you ever in Petersburg?” I asked, glancing at her suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at me inquiringly, and the smile died from her face.\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied quickly. “I came from Odessa. I have never been to the\r\ncapital. But of course you have.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said reflectively. “Unfortunately, however, my last visit was\r\nmarred by a very sad occurrence.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” she asked, lounging languidly in her chair.\r\n\r\n“The murder of my friend Ivan Liustig,” I replied calmly, gazing straight\r\ninto her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe announcement did not produce the effect I had intended. She stirred\r\nuneasily, but merely raised her eyebrows and uttered a low exclamation of\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n“The poor fellow was poisoned,” I continued, at the same time drawing my\r\nwallet from my pocket. “Here is his photograph,” I added, handing her a\r\n_carte de visite_.\r\n\r\nShe looked calmly at the pictured face.\r\n\r\n“Very sad—very sad indeed,” she remarked. “And was the murderer caught?”\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes upon the photograph as she asked the question.\r\n\r\n“Murderess,” I said, in as unconcerned a tone as I could.\r\n\r\n“A woman, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and, moreover, I have traced the assassin.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up sharply into my face. Her handsome features presented a\r\nstrange haggard appearance, and she toyed nervously with her rings.\r\n\r\n“Why—what—what do you mean?” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“Disguise is useless, Mrs. Elworthy,” I said sternly, as I rose to my\r\nfeet. “I mean I can prove that you poisoned Ivan Liustig!”\r\n\r\nShe started from her chair and glared at me.\r\n\r\n“You—you say this! You insult me, sir—in my own house—brand me a\r\nmurderess! I’ll call the servants and have you shown out instantly,” she\r\ncried angrily, at the same time making a motion as if to ring the bell.\r\n\r\nI stayed her hand.\r\n\r\n“No, madame,” I said, “you will do nothing of the kind. Your daughter\r\nhas probably not told you that I was present when she was arrested on\r\nsuspicion. Since then your guilt has been proved, and it is useless to\r\ndeny it. The bottle still containing a portion of the poison sold to you\r\nby Wagner, the chemist in the Nevski, is here,” I continued, taking it\r\nfrom my pocket and holding it before her eyes. “Besides, a Russian lad is\r\nnow in London who actually saw you pour it into Ivan’s glass!”\r\n\r\n“He lies—I—I—never was in Petersburg in my life! I never knew Ivan——”\r\n\r\nThe proud, handsome woman, now pale to the lips, stopped suddenly. Her\r\ntongue refused to articulate; she reeled, clutched at the table for\r\nsupport, but, tottering back, fell heavily to the floor. Ringing for the\r\nservants, I told them that their mistress had fainted. Then hurrying on\r\nmy coat, I crammed my hat upon my head, and left the house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLazily smoking before the fire in my chambers a fortnight afterwards,\r\nwith my feet upon the fender, I had given myself up to reflection. My\r\nreverie was somewhat puzzling, for, truth to tell, I was in love, and\r\nthe object of my affection was none other than Wanda Elworthy. Her\r\nface smiled down upon me from a cabinet photograph that stood upon the\r\nmantel-shelf; yet, as the smoke curled before it, I could not help\r\nthinking how much it resembled that of her unhappy mother.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my meditations were interrupted by a loud rat-tat at the door.\r\nOpening it, I was surprised to discover a lady, who passed me without a\r\nword, and entered my sitting-room.\r\n\r\nClosing the door I followed her, and found it was Mrs. Elworthy.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon,” I said, halting before the fire, with my hands behind\r\nmy back. “I confess I’m puzzled, madam, as to the object of this call.”\r\n\r\nFrowning slightly, she tapped the floor impatiently with her shapely foot.\r\n\r\n“My object is to come to terms with you.”\r\n\r\n“Then you admit your guilt?” I remarked, amazed.\r\n\r\n“It is useless, I suppose, to deny it. You have discovered my secret, and\r\nI am prepared to pay the price you name.”\r\n\r\nHer features were pale and set—a haggard face almost statuesque.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, madam,” I replied warmly; “I decline to accept gold as a\r\nbribe to conceal the murder of my friend.”\r\n\r\n“You misunderstand me. I have no intention of offering you money.”\r\n\r\n“Then what request have you to make, pray?” I asked, looking fixedly at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“You know the original of that photograph behind you?” she exclaimed in a\r\nharsh, strained voice, pointing at it.\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“It has come to my knowledge that you love her.”\r\n\r\nI nodded, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n“Then the object of my visit is to make a compact with you. It is this:\r\nIf you will marry Wanda within three months from to-day she shall have a\r\ndowry of twenty thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\nWe were both silent for a moment. Then I said—\r\n\r\n“Which proposal means that you are prepared to sacrifice your daughter\r\nfor the preservation of your own secret, eh?”\r\n\r\nShe did reply, but bowed her head in humiliation.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” I said severely, “I admit I love Wanda, but your proposition is\r\nabsolutely loathsome.”\r\n\r\n“Think—think—she cares for you! Besides, if you had money you would no\r\nlonger be compelled to work for an existence.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” I replied decisively.\r\n\r\n“Ah, don’t say that!” she cried hoarsely, as, with a sudden impulse,\r\nshe threw herself upon her knees before me. “See! I implore you for\r\nmercy. God knows I have tried to atone and do my duty, but I yielded to\r\ntemptation, and this is my punishment!”\r\n\r\nDrawing a long breath, she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“You—you do not know all, Anton Prèhznev, or you would find the\r\ncircumstances extenuating,” she sobbed bitterly. “I—I confess it was I\r\nwho poisoned Ivan! He—he was my son!”\r\n\r\n“Your son?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I—I’m a vile wretch; as degraded as the woman who walks the\r\npavement. I killed my son! For twenty years he was ignorant of his\r\nparentage, but, alas! he discovered the secret of his dishonourable\r\nbirth. As the living evidence of my shame he declared he would denounce\r\nme—I, who had supplied him with money and secretly guided his career.\r\nWhen he knew I was his mother he loathed me; he cursed me for my sin! His\r\nhatred stung me; he threatened to expose me to my husband. Moreover, he\r\nfell in love with my lawful daughter, Wanda, then studying in Petersburg!\r\nWhat was I to do?”\r\n\r\nShe paused. Her hands were clasped; her agonised face was uplifted in\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n“Ah! do not shrink from me!” she cried. “Have mercy, for here, before\r\nHeaven, I swear I am penitent! Exposure meant ruin. Death only could rid\r\nme of the terrible Nemesis. I went to Petersburg—followed him—and—and—you\r\nknow the rest. I—his mother—murdered him!”\r\n\r\nHer chin rested upon her breast; her white lips moved again, but no sound\r\ncame from them.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” I said at length, taking her hand and assisting her to rise,\r\n“this interview is painful to us both, let us end it.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not spare me? will you not be merciful and accept my offer?”\r\nshe implored.\r\n\r\n“I cannot. I pity you, and hope forgiveness may be yours.”\r\n\r\n“You will not accept the dowry?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\nShe turned slowly, and, blinded by tears, tottered out, closing the door\r\ngently after her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the following evening contained a sensational item of\r\nnews, headed “Suicide of an M.P.’s wife.” It ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Elworthy, wife of Mr. Harold Elworthy, M.P., of Brook Street,\r\nGrosvenor Square, was discovered dead in her dressing-room this morning.\r\nA small bottle containing arsenic was found at her side, together with\r\na letter which leaves no doubt that she committed suicide. The contents\r\nof the letter have not been made public, but it is rumoured that the\r\nconfession is of a very remarkable character.”\r\n\r\nAn inquest was held, and a verdict of “suicide whilst temporarily insane”\r\nreturned. Immediately following this came the announcement that the\r\nmember for North-west Huntingdon had accepted the stewardship of the\r\nChiltern Hundreds and gone abroad, accompanied by his daughter Wanda.\r\nThey have never returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE TZAR’S SPY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA chaos of terrible recollections bewilders me. I have the sense of\r\nhaving trodden a stony highway during long years, but have now taken my\r\nlast step for the present in the blood-spotted pathway to Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe windows at the rear of the Château de Trélatête, a quaint old-world\r\nplace, near the high road from St. Germain to Paris, look out upon a\r\nwide, well-kept lawn, flanked by dark yew hedges, and backed by the\r\nwinding Seine, on the opposite bank of which a sparsely timbered slope\r\nleads up to a small farm. Zigzag up this slope runs a path—probably it\r\nhas so run for centuries, for at the foot of it is a ford across a small\r\nstream—which in spring is almost invisible, but in autumn is brown and\r\nrutty.\r\n\r\nTwo men strolled down this path one September evening not long ago.\r\nOne, a young fellow under thirty, fair-haired and pink-cheeked, was\r\nsomething of a fop, while the other was a tall man, about fifty-five,\r\nof military bearing, with a pair of keen eyes, sharply cut features,\r\nand hair and moustache turning grey. Attired in a rather shabby velvet\r\ncoat and gaiters, he looked like a gamekeeper, but was, in fact, General\r\nMartianoff, late Governor of Mstislavl, and now Chief of the Russian\r\nSecret Police in Paris.\r\n\r\n“I really can’t make you out, Gaston,” he said, as they sighted the\r\nChâteau; and, shifting his gun to the other shoulder, he took occasion to\r\nglance searchingly at his companion. “How confoundedly glum you are!”\r\n\r\nThe younger man laughed, but not very merrily, and there was a touch of\r\nsullenness in his tone as he answered—\r\n\r\n“How absurd! A man cannot be always grinning.”\r\n\r\n“No; but _pâté de foie gras_ is not man’s ordinary meat,” retorted the\r\nGeneral imperturbably. “My dear Guéneau.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the other snappishly.\r\n\r\n“You are in a mess; that is my opinion! Now, take my advice, and make a\r\nclean breast of the matter. You have some tie or other which weighs upon\r\nyour mind and of which we are ignorant.”\r\n\r\nThe young man turned his face to his companion, and General Martianoff,\r\nalbeit a very cool personage, was taken aback by the change which anger\r\nor some other emotion had worked in it. Even Gaston Guéneau’s voice was\r\naltered.\r\n\r\n“And what if I have?” he asked hoarsely, stopping short so suddenly that\r\nthe pair confronted one another. “What if I have, m’sieur?”\r\n\r\nThe chief spy twirled his moustache thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, outwardly unmoved, “you must break it—get rid of it.\r\nThat is all, Guéneau.”\r\n\r\n“And if I am unable?”\r\n\r\n“Unwilling, you mean.”\r\n\r\n“No, cannot, cannot!” declared the younger man with vehemence.\r\n\r\n“But you must. You hear! you must! Otherwise it will be your ruin.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! Don’t talk like that. Come with me to the Château?”\r\n\r\n“No!” answered the General violently. And without more, without a word of\r\nfarewell, he turned his back and strode away through the long grass to a\r\npoint half a mile higher up the river, where a wooden bridge gave access\r\nto the station of Le Pecq, whence he returned to Paris.\r\n\r\nI had followed the pair, and overheard their conversation.\r\n\r\nThe news that M. Lozé, the Préfect of Paris Police, had called and\r\nhad a prolonged interview with the Tzar’s spy had caused considerable\r\nexcitement in the Revolutionist settlement at La Glacière. It was\r\nanticipated that the General and the Préfect were putting their\r\nheads together for the purpose of getting the worst-noted of the\r\nrefugees entrapped by the Russian police. In order, therefore, to\r\nwatch Martianoff’s movements closely, I had been sent to Paris with\r\ninstructions to ascertain, if possible, who were the suspected persons\r\nand what system of espionage was being adopted.\r\n\r\nWas it surprising that upon this brutal agent of his Imperial Majesty,\r\nwho had wrecked the careers of my sister and myself, I kept a watchful\r\neye? He was a ferret in human shape, and with the dozen Russian\r\ndetectives under him, he had a keen scent for Revolutionists and\r\ncriminating circumstances. Since his resignation from the governorship of\r\nMstislavl he had graduated at the Bureau of Secret Police in Petersburg.\r\n\r\nHe lived in the Boulevard Haussmann, at the corner of the Avenue de\r\nMessine, where he occupied an _entresol_ which looked out into the\r\ncourtyard, leading the life of a man with an adequate income. He only had\r\ntwo saddle horses, with a groom of all-work brought by him from Russia,\r\nand he contented himself with a hired brougham. He breakfasted in his\r\nrooms, dined at the fashionable restaurants, showed himself in the Bois\r\nof an afternoon, at theatrical first-nights, knew all Paris—the “_tout\r\nParis_” of the Boulevard—and was received in a very exclusive set. Yet he\r\nhad few intimate friends, he seldom received his habitual acquaintances\r\nat his rooms, and often absented himself for several days without saying\r\nwhere he was going.\r\n\r\nHis concierge revered him, and never expressed astonishment when he saw\r\nrather seedy-looking people climb the stairs leading to the apartments\r\nof this rich and respectable tenant. General Martianoff made a show\r\nof philanthropy, and, according to the hall-porter, his reputation\r\nas a charitable gentleman exposed him to the visits of needy-looking\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nI did not return to Paris by the same train as the spy, but lingered in\r\norder to make inquiries regarding the companion he had so unceremoniously\r\nquitted. With that object I remained at a small _estaminet_ on the road\r\nwhich runs through the Bois de Vésinet to Montesson, chatting to an old\r\nwood-cutter, and eliciting some facts regarding the Guéneau family.\r\nThe Château belonged to Count Jules Guéneau, a wealthy old gentleman,\r\nwho, according to the wood-cutter’s statement, had held important\r\nGovernment offices under the Empire, but who was now on the verge of\r\nsenile imbecility, and lived in seclusion with his son Gaston. The latter\r\nhad travelled a great deal, and had quite recently settled down at the\r\nChâteau, at the old Count’s request.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set, and it was growing dusk as I left the _estaminet_. I\r\nhad just emerged from the wood and turned into the high-road when I\r\nperceived, about a hundred paces from me, a figure rapidly approaching.\r\nI slipped behind a tree and watched its progress. It was that of a tall,\r\nslender girl, exquisitely graceful, with rounded throat and arms, her\r\ndark, wavy hair drawn back from her brow, a flawless complexion, and\r\nhandsome brown eyes. As she passed I recognised her as Natalya Lebedeff,\r\ndaughter of a prominent member of our Organisation, who, about four years\r\nbefore, had fled from Russia and taken refuge in Paris, where he now kept\r\na tobacconist’s in the Rue d’Amsterdam, close to the St. Lazare terminus.\r\n\r\nThe road that she followed was bordered with oak-trees and quickset\r\nhedges. I walked after her cautiously, for I was curious to know what had\r\nbrought her to St. Germain.\r\n\r\nAfter making several turns, the road sloped gently towards a stone bridge\r\nthrown across the small stream. Close by was a hamlet built upon the\r\nside of a hill, and surrounded by walnut-trees, while the green waters,\r\nbubbling over the pebbles that formed its bed, rushed onwards towards the\r\nSeine.\r\n\r\nUpon the bridge stood Gaston, and she moved directly towards him.\r\n\r\nWhen they met she did not take the hand he offered. Withdrawing it\r\nquickly, he said, “You are right, Natalya, I am a villain!” The words\r\nseemed to come from his inmost heart. Then he continued, “Spurn me from\r\nyou, as I deserve. I scarcely expected that you would come from Paris to\r\nkeep the appointment. Here are the papers; do what you please with them.”\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking she shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I have forgiven all,” the girl said. Eagerly seizing the papers, and\r\nfolding them small, she placed them in the pocket of her dress.\r\n\r\nShe shivered slightly as they walked together. The path they entered\r\nfollowed the course of the stream and led down to the river. They were\r\nsilent, absorbed in thought. One seemed filled with grief, remorse, and\r\nexpectation; the other felt her destiny weighing heavily upon her, and\r\nthought she heard within the woods the agitated beating of a heart which\r\nwas kept in motion only by its fears.\r\n\r\nFrom my hiding-place I watched them disappear in the fast-falling gloom;\r\nthen I turned and hurried to Le Pecq, where I arrived just in time to\r\ncatch a train for Paris.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, while walking down the Rue de Monceau on my way to my\r\nunpretentious hotel in the Rue de Lisbonne, I passed General Martianoff.\r\nHe was in evening dress, and walking away from the house in which he\r\nlived, evidently on his way to dine.\r\n\r\nThen a thought suddenly occurred to me, and, after a moment’s hesitation,\r\nI turned down the Avenue de Messine to the corner house on the boulevard.\r\n\r\nAscending the stairs unnoticed by the sleepy concierge, I knocked at the\r\ndoor of the General’s apartments. Replying to my inquiry in Russian, the\r\nman-servant, a thin, cadaverous-looking fellow, informed me that his\r\nExcellency was out, and his return was uncertain.\r\n\r\n“But I have to see him upon official business,” I said, at the same time\r\nslipping a ten-franc piece into his ready palm. “Show me to his room, and\r\nI will wait.”\r\n\r\nConducting me along the hall, he showed me into a large well-furnished\r\nroom, the two windows of which looked out upon the boulevard. The heavy\r\ncurtains were drawn, a large brass lamp burned brightly under a shade of\r\ncrimson silk, and the spacious saddle-bag armchairs gave the apartment an\r\nair of cosiness. It was half library, half sitting-room, and the littered\r\nwriting-table that stood in a recess near the fireplace showed that the\r\nex-Governor had considerable correspondence.\r\n\r\nIt was to ascertain the nature of his communications that I had ventured\r\ninto the spy’s sanctum. When the servant had withdrawn and closed the\r\ndoor, I immediately commenced my investigations. Rapidly glancing at\r\nthe open letters and memoranda, I saw they related to various persons\r\nsuspected of Nihilism, resident in Paris.\r\n\r\nPresently I took up a large folded blue paper and opened it. The document\r\nrevealed how closely Russian suspects were being watched. It was the\r\nreport of a Secret Police agent who had been told off to keep observation\r\nupon Israel Lebedeff, the father of Natalya. In order that my readers\r\nmay fully understand the manner in which the “Security Section” carries\r\nout its system of espionage, I give the following copy of the printed\r\nquestions:—\r\n\r\n    IMPERIAL POLICE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n    THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO BE FILLED IN WEEKLY:—\r\n\r\n    1. What is the Christian name, paternal name, and family name\r\n    of the person under observation?\r\n\r\n    2. Where is his (or her) residence? In what district, street,\r\n    and house? What is the number of the room? How many rooms?\r\n\r\n    3. Where did you first see him, and under what circumstances?\r\n    Has he seen you?\r\n\r\n    4. How long has he resided at his present address? Whence did\r\n    he come? Give particulars of his last place of residence.\r\n\r\n    5. Does he live alone, or with some one? In the latter case\r\n    with whom? State particulars of such person.\r\n\r\n    6. Has he any servants? If so, what are their names? If not,\r\n    who looks after his room, or rooms? What things has he in\r\n    his rooms? To whom is his dirty linen sent? State name and\r\n    residence of his laundress?\r\n\r\n    7. Does he have his meals at home, or elsewhere? In the latter\r\n    case, where?\r\n\r\n    8. Does he visit any library, and if so, which one? State what\r\n    books he has borrowed in the course of the week.\r\n\r\n    9. At what o’clock does he leave his rooms, and when does he\r\n    return?\r\n\r\n    10. How does he spend his time at home?\r\n\r\n    11. Has he a wife, or children? If the latter, how many?\r\n\r\n    12. Is he paying attention to any woman? If so, who is she and\r\n    where does she live? Where do they meet?\r\n\r\n    13. Who has visited him in the course of the week? At what\r\n    times? a.m. or p.m.?\r\n\r\n    14. Has any one (male or female) spent the night in his rooms?\r\n    If so, what person or persons? Their residence?\r\n\r\n    15. Has he ever been in a state of intoxication?\r\n\r\n    16. Does he receive letters or papers from Russia?\r\n\r\n    17. What hour is best for his arrest?\r\n\r\nAll these questions were answered with a minuteness of detail that was\r\nastounding, the document being signed by the officer of surveillance,\r\nand countersigned by General Martianoff. Absorbed in the perusal of the\r\nreport, I did not notice the presence of the servant, who had entered\r\nstealthily, and suddenly stood before me, causing me to start and replace\r\nthe paper hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Anton Prèhznev,” he said, “you had better leave before the General\r\nreturns.”\r\n\r\n“You know me?” I gasped in bewilderment.\r\n\r\nFor answer he smiled, and gave me the sign of our Order.\r\n\r\n“How came you in the spy’s service?” I asked. “What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“I’m Paul Shiryàlov. The General engaged me as his servant when he\r\nvisited Petersburg last year.”\r\n\r\n“You know the contents of the papers brought here by the spies?”\r\n\r\n“I make copies of them all and forward them to the Petersburg Circle.”\r\n\r\n“Has Lebedeff been warned?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He has sold his business, and is arranging to leave Paris for\r\nLondon.”\r\n\r\n“And what of Natalya, his daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Hark!—the General has returned. Quick!”\r\n\r\nHe almost dragged me through a door which led into an adjoining room,\r\nwhence I passed out upon the staircase.\r\n\r\nI hurried downstairs, and a few moments afterwards was walking along the\r\nRue de la Pepinière towards my hotel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA loud knocking at the door of my bedroom and a voice demanding\r\nadmittance aroused me.\r\n\r\nWhen I unlocked the door, Paramòn Pouzàtov, a refugee, rushed in.\r\n\r\n“They have arrested Lebedeff!” he exclaimed breathlessly. “Last night\r\nfour _sergents de ville_ went to the house, searched, and discovered\r\nsome bombs in course of manufacture and some literature from the secret\r\npress. He was arrested and taken to the Prefecture.”\r\n\r\n“But he was warned in time to escape,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but he is now in their grip.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Natalya?”\r\n\r\n“She went out yesterday afternoon, and has not yet returned.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said. “But we must secure his release at all hazards.”\r\n\r\nParamòn seated himself and chatted to me while I dressed. It puzzled me\r\nthat the Paris police should have found explosives on the tobacconist’s\r\npremises, especially after the ample warning that Shiryàlov had given.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed. Lebedeff was detained for inquiries, and nothing had\r\nbeen heard of Natalya. Although our Organisation exerted every effort to\r\ntrace the girl, no clue to her whereabouts could be discovered. She had\r\nmysteriously disappeared, and we were seriously handicapped in our search\r\nby the fact that it was not considered wise policy to inquire of Gaston\r\nGuéneau, as he evidently had some secret understanding with General\r\nMartianoff.\r\n\r\nOne morning, a fortnight after Lebedeff’s arrest, I was present at the\r\nCorrectional Court of the Seine, when he was charged with being in the\r\npossession of explosives, contrary to the Code. Evidence was given by\r\nseveral detectives, while Martianoff, disguised as an honest-looking\r\nworkman, stood at the rear of the Court watching the proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhen the evidence regarding the bombs was complete the Public Prosecutor\r\nmade an application. He stated that the prisoner had been identified by\r\npolice agents from Petersburg as one who was “wanted” in that city in\r\nconnection with the laying of a mine of dynamite under the Norwinski\r\nStrasse, in order to make an attempt upon the life of the Tzar. Further\r\nevidence was then given by an _attaché_ of the Russian Embassy and two\r\nagents of the Secret Police, the prisoner eventually being formally\r\ncommitted for extradition to Russia.\r\n\r\nI left the court with a conviction that the escape of my compatriot was\r\nhopeless, and that Siberian hard labour would inevitably be his sentence.\r\n\r\nWhile walking along the Boulevard des Italiens, immersed in my own\r\nthoughts, Paramòn Pouzàtov accosted me, and dragged me into a quiet café.\r\n\r\n“Look,” he exclaimed in a low tone, producing from his pocket a soiled\r\nand crumpled copy of that day’s _Gaulois_; “Read that!” and he pointed to\r\na paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe few lines were as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Last night a bargeman, named Hovelacque, while steering his craft on\r\nthe Seine near Croissy, noticed a dark object floating in the water.\r\nHe grappled it with his boat-hook, and when he drew it on board was\r\nhorrified to find that it was the body of a well-dressed young girl.\r\nNothing was found upon her whereby her identity could be established, and\r\nthe body was conveyed to the Morgue.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” I said, interrogatively, after I had read it.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it can be Natalya Lebedeff?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” I ejaculated, suddenly recollecting her mysterious disappearance.\r\n“We will go to the Morgue and ascertain.”\r\n\r\nWe at once left the Boulevard and proceeded to the house of the dead\r\nbehind Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nIt needed not a second glance at the rigid body lying upon its cold slate\r\nslab to tell that Pouzàtov’s surmise was correct. The body was that of\r\nthe pretty Natalya. Instantly my thoughts reverted to Gaston Guéneau.\r\nCould he be her murderer?\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards I called at General Martianoff’s, when Shiryàlov\r\nhanded me secretly a sheet of paper folded small, which I quickly\r\ntransferred to my pocket. It was a detailed account of the movements of\r\nthe Chief of Secret Police during the last twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the prominent members of the Circle of Paris met at a house\r\nin La Glacière. I produced reports and papers which conclusively showed\r\nthat General Martianoff was the head of the Russian spies in the French\r\ncapital, and Shiryàlov, who also attended, made a statement. The\r\nmanner in which Lebedeff had been watched, arrested, and sent back to\r\nPetersburg had aroused the ire and hatred of every man present, and it\r\nwas unanimously agreed that the ex-Governor of Mstislavl, being a sworn\r\nenemy of Russian freedom, should be sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Tribunal then took a number of pieces of paper,\r\nand upon one sketched roughly the death-emblem of our Order. The papers\r\nwere then folded carefully, placed in a box, and every man drew one. The\r\ndrawing was carried on in silence. The one to whose lot it fell to strike\r\nthe fatal blow made no sign, and none in that assembly were aware who had\r\nbeen selected to carry out the sentence. Silence is always preserved in\r\nsuch cases in order to ensure absolute secrecy, and to give the murderer\r\na better chance of evading the police.\r\n\r\nThat night, as Shiryàlov and I were returning to Paris together, I\r\nnoticed he appeared thoughtful and morose, and asked the reason.\r\n\r\n“I must leave the General’s service to-morrow,” he replied. “There is an\r\nurgent reason that I should do so.”\r\n\r\n“Could I not apply for the situation?” I suggested, as a scheme suddenly\r\nentered my mind.\r\n\r\n“Yes, why not?” he said, brightening. “You could then continue watching.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I replied. “Give notice to-night, and I will apply at\r\nmid-day to-morrow. I already have a recommendation as a valet and\r\ntrustworthy servant,” I added, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Who from?”\r\n\r\n“A Captain of Cossacks with whom I travelled a few years ago.”\r\n\r\nThen he smiled and once more assumed his usual gaiety.\r\n\r\nA week afterwards I was duly installed as valet to the General, while\r\nShiryàlov had been engaged as messenger to the Franco-Russian Club in the\r\nRue Royale. My work was not particularly heavy, for the chief _mouchard_\r\nwas out for greater part of each day, which gave me opportunities for\r\ninvestigating and making copies of the reports of espionage that arrived\r\ndaily from male and female secret agents.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about three weeks after the meeting of the Circle at\r\nLa Glacière, I chanced to take up a paper, and my eyes fell upon a\r\ntelegram from Petersburg, stating that Israel Lebedeff had been tried by\r\ncourt-martial, found guilty of an attempt upon the life of the Emperor,\r\nand had been sentenced to hard labour for life in Siberia.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the door bell rang, and I admitted a short, stout,\r\nshabbily attired Frenchman, who, without addressing me, walked straight\r\nthrough to the room in which the General was sitting, closing the door\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nThe fact that he had a newspaper in his hand aroused my curiosity, and\r\nby placing my ear at the keyhole I was enabled to catch part of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Ah! So they found him guilty, eh?” I heard the General exclaim. “Well,\r\nwe shall be commended by his Majesty for our shrewdness.”\r\n\r\n“Shrewdness!” observed the visitor, with a hollow laugh. “True, we may\r\ncall it so, but _entre nous_, I do not like the aspect affairs might\r\nassume if all the facts were known.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? One Nihilist, more or less, surely cannot matter!”\r\n\r\n“The arrest was made at the cost of the girl Natalya’s life.”\r\n\r\n“She committed suicide,” replied the Tzar’s agent quickly. “And what is\r\nmore, her body has been buried without identification.”\r\n\r\n“She did not commit suicide,” said the detective calmly. “She was\r\nmurdered!”\r\n\r\n“How are you aware of that?”\r\n\r\n“The spies of the Secret Police are everywhere. One was present when she\r\nwas flung into the river—it was I.”\r\n\r\n“Hush! speak lower,” urged the General. “My servant might overhear.”\r\nThen he added: “Listen, and I will prove to you that our action was\r\njustifiable. Gaston Guéneau, who was an _attaché_ at Petersburg, and\r\nwhose father owns the Château, was likely to be of service to Russia, and\r\nfor that reason I carefully courted his companionship. I was not long in\r\ndiscovering that he entertained Nihilistic views, and that he was an old\r\nfriend of Lebedeff’s. Gaston and Natalya, although not lovers, frequently\r\nmet clandestinely in the interests of the revolutionary movement.\r\nNatalya, by some unaccountable means, discovered that I was connected\r\nwith the Imperial Police, and on informing Gaston, prevailed upon him to\r\nsteal some papers relating to our investigations regarding her father.\r\nHe called upon me one day, and I was incautious enough to leave him here\r\nalone for a few moments, during which time he purloined a most important\r\nletter, one, that if ever produced, would be most damning evidence\r\nagainst us, and probably cause our expulsion from France. It exposed our\r\nlittle plot against Lebedeff, and explained the manner in which the bombs\r\nwere to be introduced into his house. Of course, you quite understand\r\nthat the Bureau at Petersburg was growing impatient, and we were bound to\r\narrest some one.”\r\n\r\n“One Nihilist is as good as another, providing you can fasten a\r\nconspiracy upon him, eh?” remarked the visitor with sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” continued Martianoff. “When I found the letter was missing, I\r\nhad strict watch kept upon both Guéneau and the girl, by which means I\r\ndiscovered that he handed her the papers without reading them himself,\r\nfor she had asked him not to do so. It was clear that, when she read\r\nthem, she would place her father upon his guard, and there was also\r\na possibility of us being caught like rats in a trap. Hence it was\r\nimperative, both for the success of our plans and the prestige of the\r\nImperial Police, that we should secure her silence. There was but one way\r\nto do this—death! I returned to St. Germain that night——”\r\n\r\n“I know the rest,” interrupted the spy; “I followed you, thinking you\r\nmight require assistance. You met the girl on the river bank, after she\r\nhad left Gaston, and having taken the papers from her pocket, gripped her\r\nby the throat and threw her into the river.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! she was only a Jewess,” said Martianoff unconcernedly. “Had she\r\nescaped she would have probably taken the papers to one of the Socialist\r\nDeputies, an interpellation would have been made in the Chamber, and the\r\nletter produced. With what result? Disaster, disgrace, and public opinion\r\nso strong against us that we should be compelled to quit France.”\r\n\r\n“Instead of which we shall receive commendation, and perhaps decoration,\r\nfrom the Tzar,” observed the Frenchman. “Ah! you were right, M’sieur le\r\nGénéral. You are always right. His Majesty should, indeed, be gratified\r\nat possessing such a diplomatic agent as yourself. The murder shall not\r\nbe mentioned again between us.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment there were sounds as of some one walking across the room,\r\ntherefore I left the door abruptly and consequently heard no more.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the stout Frenchman I was sent to deliver a\r\nletter in the Avenue de l’Opéra, and after an absence of half an hour\r\nreturned and continued my work in my own room.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I resumed when the door-bell again rang. Opening it, I was\r\nconfronted by Paul Shiryàlov, who held a letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n“An invitation to a ball at the Franco-Russian Club; to be delivered\r\npersonally,” he whispered significantly, as he passed me and entered the\r\nGeneral’s room unannounced. There was nothing unusual in this, for he\r\nfrequently brought messages, therefore I returned to my work of dusting\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nA moment later, however, I heard a low exclamation of surprise, followed\r\nby a peculiar noise as if some heavy article had fallen upon the floor,\r\nand I saw Shiryàlov, with pale, affrighted face, hurrying out.\r\n\r\nI rushed into Martianoff’s room to ascertain what had happened, but at\r\nfirst saw nothing unusual. On the opposite side of the writing-table,\r\nhowever, a horrifying sight met my gaze.\r\n\r\nLying upon the rug before the fireplace was the General. Blood was upon\r\nhis hands, and a brief examination showed that he had been shot in the\r\nbreast with a revolver. He was still breathing, and as I lifted his head\r\nupon my arm he gasped the one word in Russian, “Revenge!”\r\n\r\nThe respiration immediately became fainter, and in a few seconds he died.\r\n\r\nThe chief spy had been assassinated. His papers were in disorder, and\r\nthe fact that a bureau had been broken open showed that the murderer had\r\nsearched for something he particularly desired.\r\n\r\nI quickly summoned medical aid, and was afterwards closely examined by\r\nthe _juge d’instruction_, but as I kept Shiryàlov’s identity a secret,\r\nand could throw no light upon the mysterious crime, I was set at liberty.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy created a great sensation throughout Paris, especially when\r\nit became known that General Martianoff, who was popular in society and\r\nsupposed to be a retired officer possessed of ample means, was in reality\r\nChief of the French Section of Secret Police. The funeral took place at\r\nPère Lachaise a week afterwards, but neither the _mouchards_ of M. Goron\r\nnor the spies of the Tzar discovered the murderer.\r\n\r\nInformation by some means, however, reached the police that Shiryàlov had\r\nnot returned to the club in the Rue Royale. He was at once suspected,\r\nespecially when it was discovered that immediately after the murder\r\nhe had left for Brussels. But the far-reaching influence of Nihilism\r\nhad already been set in motion, and although the police of Europe were\r\nwatching for the fugitive, yet they were baffled at every turn. He\r\nmoved from place to place with an alacrity almost incredible. Secret\r\ninformation we received showed that after leaving Paris he fled to Namur,\r\nthence to Brussels, Antwerp, London, Palermo, Malta, and Gibraltar.\r\nWhile at the latter place he became despondent, and a fiasco nearly\r\nresulted. So rapidly had he travelled that the money collected for him\r\nin Geneva and London did not reach him, consequently he found himself at\r\nthe “Rock” penniless and starving. In this condition he was walking the\r\nstreets and had determined to give himself up to the English authorities,\r\nwhen a delegate from the Paris Circle found him, and supplied him with\r\nfunds, by which he was enabled to sail for America.\r\n\r\nFor several months nothing further was heard of him, although a member of\r\nthe La Glacière colony, who was connected with the Havas Press Agency,\r\nfrom time to time circulated reports as to the movements of the fugitive,\r\nin order to place the police on false scents.\r\n\r\nOne morning, however, the papers published what appeared to be an\r\nauthentic account of Shiryàlov’s suicide, which had taken place in a\r\nremote village in Texas. The pistol with which he had shot himself bore\r\nthe name of a well-known Paris politician, who was known to have aided\r\nthe criminal in his flight. Photographs that were afterwards forwarded\r\nto France were those of Shiryàlov. Moreover, some of the lists of\r\nRevolutionists resident in the French capital, which were abstracted\r\nfrom the spy’s bureau, were found upon the body, together with a written\r\nconfession of the crime.\r\n\r\nNo doubt was therefore entertained by the police as to the suicide’s\r\nidentity, and the search for the assassin was consequently relinquished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne winter’s afternoon several months afterwards, I was sitting at home,\r\nin London, when I received an unexpected visit from Mascha.\r\n\r\n“Congratulate me, Anton,” she said gaily, after we had exchanged warm\r\ngreetings. “I have married!”\r\n\r\n“Married!” I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, our wedding took place in Paris yesterday. Although you know my\r\nhusband by sight, you have never spoken to him.”\r\n\r\n“What’s his name?”\r\n\r\n“Gaston Guéneau.”\r\n\r\n“The son of Count Jules Guéneau?” I asked, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied, laughing. “I knew him when he was an _attaché_ at the\r\nFrench Embassy at Petersburg, and although after poor Ivan’s death we\r\nbecame engaged, we resolved to keep the matter a secret. He joined our\r\nCircle, but his revolutionary tendency was discovered by the police, and\r\nhe was recalled to France. In one of his letters he told me that he had\r\nbecome friendly with a General Martianoff. Knowing that our enemy, the\r\nex-Governor of Mstislavl, was in the service of the ‘Third Section,’ I\r\nsuspected that he was being drawn into the cleverly-woven web. Therefore\r\nI proceeded to Paris in order to keep watch upon the spy, and warn\r\nGaston against him. I had no idea that you were engaged in the same\r\nmatter, or that you had discovered who murdered Natalya Lebedeff until\r\none day, quite recently, when they were talking of it at a meeting at La\r\nGlacière.”\r\n\r\n“But you were aware that Shiryàlov had killed the General?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! there, even you are mistaken,” she said, with a smile. “Paul was\r\ninnocent.”\r\n\r\n“How can that be?” I asked. “I was present when he entered the room, and\r\nwhen he left the house after the assassination.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. But although he sought the spy intending to carry out the\r\nsentence of death that had been passed, he did not commit the deed.\r\nIt was through me that the tyrant of Mstislavl was killed. On the\r\nnight previous to the tragedy I was with Paramòn Pouzàtov who, as you\r\nknow, was one of my admirers. I related to him the story of my life at\r\nMstislavl, and the brutal treatment you and I had received at the hands\r\nof Martianoff. My description of his brutality, coupled with the vile\r\nconspiracy against Lebedeff, so incensed him that he swore he would\r\nremove the Tzar’s chief spy with his own hand. I did not regard his\r\nwords seriously, but on the following morning, while I was waiting in\r\nthe Boulevard in order to follow Martianoff when he emerged from his\r\nhouse, he approached me. He was wild-looking and haggard-eyed. ‘I have\r\nkilled him!’ he whispered, at the same time handing me some papers. Then\r\nhe hurried along the Boulevard and was quickly lost to view. The next I\r\nheard was that Shiryàlov was suspected.”\r\n\r\n“But Paul fled to America.”\r\n\r\n“True. But only in order to baffle the police. He has not committed\r\nsuicide, for I have here a letter which he wrote from New York to my\r\nhusband only a week ago.”\r\n\r\nI took the note and read it. There was no doubt it was from him, for I\r\nrecognised the handwriting.\r\n\r\nSubsequent inquiries I made fully confirmed Mascha’s solution of the\r\nmystery. It had fallen to Paul Shiryàlov’s lot to encompass the death of\r\nGeneral Martianoff, but prompted by vengeance Pouzàtov—one of the most\r\ndesperate of the Terrorists—had entered the room and assassinated the\r\nChief of Secret Police while I was absent delivering the letter in the\r\nAvenue de l’Opéra.\r\n\r\nAfter Shiryàlov had made good his escape, and Pouzàtov considered himself\r\nsecure, he pressed Mascha to marry him. But she refused, and kept her\r\npromise to Gaston.\r\n\r\nCount Guéneau having died, she now lives happily at the Château with her\r\nhusband. Both are still enthusiastic and sanguine as to the ultimate\r\nsuccess of the struggle for freedom, and being possessed of an ample\r\nfortune, contribute generously to the Revolutionary Fund.\r\n\r\nThe Terrorists are now pausing. They believe that the ravages caused by\r\nrecent famines in Russia can never be repaired. The vast Empire of the\r\nTzar has now no alternative but to resign herself and gradually sink to\r\nthe position of a decaying power like Turkey, or to throw open her gates\r\nto European progress, that goes hand in hand with freedom. At present\r\nthere is no corner in the Russian Empire where the _moujik_ is not\r\nmoaning. In the fields and along the highways, in prisons and dungeons,\r\nat the mines in shackles of iron, by the side of hayricks and empty\r\nbarns, under the waggons and on the steppes, the air is everywhere filled\r\nwith groaning—groaning in hovels, cursing even the sunlight, groaning\r\nbefore the palaces of justice, and buffeted at the entrance of garish\r\nmansions, groaning alike in town and village, the wretched _moujik_ is\r\neven ready to rise and strike a desperate blow for liberty. Sounds of woe\r\nfloat over the mighty Russian rivers from Archangel to the Caspian. They\r\ncall it a song, the chant of the _bourlaki_ (workmen) dragging the boats\r\nalong, but alas! it is the sorrowful dirge of an endless agony.\r\n\r\nUntil the new era dawns—as it certainly must ere long—the Great White\r\nTerror will continue its deadly combat with the cruel and despotic\r\nAutocracy; its Damoclean force becoming even stronger and more\r\nirresistible, until it brings another disaster upon the House of the\r\nRomanoffs that will startle the world. Then a time will follow like that\r\nunder Ivan the Terrible. When the day will come no man knows; but none\r\nthe less sooner or later—and perhaps the time is not far distant—the\r\npeople will shake their limbs, and Russia will tremble to her very\r\nfoundations. The people who vainly awaited liberation at the hands of\r\ntheir rulers will then free themselves. They will demand an eye for an\r\neye, a tooth for a tooth. The sins of the past will be visited on the\r\nguilty with all the horrors to which the oppressed in time past have been\r\nsubjected by them. Then the Polish revolution will be mere child’s play\r\nin comparison with the great drama on the day of vengeance, and that such\r\na day will surely come is inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe Russian people will judge who insulted them, who mistrusted them, who\r\nenslaved them, who spilt their blood. They will act in the manner of the\r\nFrench nation, and amid the ruins of wrecked palaces and the _débris_ of\r\na fallen dynasty, the condemned torturers will cry for mercy. The burning\r\nscene at Moscow will be repeated on a larger scale, not for the purpose\r\nof killing French soldiery, but of serving as a beacon fire to proclaim\r\nto Russians the Day of Redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNWIN BROTHERS, THE GRESHAM PRESS, WOKING AND LONDON.",
