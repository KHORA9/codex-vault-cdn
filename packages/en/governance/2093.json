OTIS.\r\n\r\n[MS., copy in Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, March 19th 1773\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI have the honor of joining with my brethren the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence for the town in a letter to you, which the bearer\r\nof this is chargd with & will deliver to you.\r\n\r\nThe occasion is somewhat singular. Our Brother Mr William\r\nMolineux, a few days ago receiv'd an ANONYMOUS letter dated\r\nBarnstable &.c, in which mention is made of some rude Aspersions\r\ncast upon the characters of himself and several others of our\r\nCommittee by your Representative Mr Bacon in a public meeting of\r\nyour Town. As the intelligence was thus uncertain the Committee\r\nwould fain hope that it was impossible for one of Mr Bacon's\r\nstation in life to act so unjustifiable a part; especially after\r\nthe handsome things which he had the credit of saying of every\r\none of Committee upon a late occasion in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Admitting however, that this might be the case,\r\nthey thought it prudent to address you, as the Moderator of your\r\nmeeting, and it is their desire, if you judge there is a proper\r\nfoundation for this letter AND NOT OTHERWISE, to obtain the\r\nconsent of the Town that it should be openly read in the meeting\r\nat the ensuing adjournment. This the Committee refer to your\r\nknown discretion, as they cannot place a full dependence upon an\r\nanonymous letter, although there are some circumstances that may\r\nseem to corroborate it.\r\n\r\nAs there is no measure which tends more to disconcert the Designs\r\nof the enemies of the public liberty, than the raising Committees\r\nof Correspondence in the several towns throughout the Province,\r\nit is not to be wondered at that the whole strength of their\r\nopposition is aim'd against it. Whether Mr B. is of this\r\ncharacter is a question in which his Constituents ought certainly\r\nto satisfy themselves beyond a reasonable doubt. A man's\r\nprofessions may be as he pleases; but I honestly confess I cannot\r\neasily believe him to be a sincere friend to his Country, who can\r\nupon any consideration be prevail'd upon to associate with so\r\ndetestable an enemy to it as I take a BOSTON BORN (I cannot say\r\neducated) Commissioner of Customs to be.\r\n\r\nI am with great regard for your family and conexions in\r\nB[arnstable.]\r\n\r\nSir your assured Friend\r\n& most humble servant\r\n\r\nP. S. If there is not foundation for what is asserted in the\r\nanonymous letter, we desire that you will not only not read our\r\nletter in your meeting but also not let the original or a copy\r\nof it go out of your hands, but return it by the first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nut supra\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT TO THE TOWN OF BOSTON, MARCH 23, 1773.\r\n\r\n[MS., Boston Public Library; the text, with slight variations,\r\nwas printed in the Boston Gazette, March 29, 1773, in the\r\nMassachusetts Spy, March 25, 1773, and in Boston Record\r\nCommissioner's Report, vol. xviii., pp. 120-125.]\r\n\r\nAt a legal Meeting of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of\r\nthe Town of Boston, at Faneuil-Hall on Monday the 8th of March\r\n1773, and continued by Adjournment to the 23d instant.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Adams acquainted the Moderator, that he was directed\r\nby a Committee (of which he was Chairman) to make a report; and\r\nthe same was read as follows, viz.1\r\n\r\nThe Committee appointed \"to consider what is proper to be done,\r\nto vindicate the Town from the gross Misrepresentations &\r\ngroundless Charges in his Excellencys Message to both Houses\" of\r\nthe General Assembly \"respecting the Proceedings of the Town at\r\ntheir last Meeting\", beg Leave to report.\r\n\r\nThat having carefully looked over the several Speeches of the\r\nGovernor of the Province, to the Council and House of\r\nRepresentatives, in the last Session of the General Assembly,\r\nthey find that his Excellency has plainly insinuated;\r\n\r\nFirst, that the said Meeting of the Town was illegal in itself.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the Points therein determind were such, as the Law\r\ngives the Inhabitants of Towns in their Corporate Capacity no\r\nPower to act upon; and therefore that the Proceedings of said\r\nMeeting were against Law. And,\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the Inhabitants thus assembled advanced and\r\nafterwards publishd to the World, such Principles as have a\r\ndirect Tendency to alienate the Affections of the People from\r\ntheir Sovereign: And he plainly asserts, that they \"denied in the\r\nmost express terms the Supremacy of Parliament, and invited every\r\nother Town & District in the Province to adopt the same\r\nPrinciples.\"\r\n\r\nWe have therefore thought it necessary to recur to the Methods\r\ntaken for calling said Meeting. And they find that three\r\nPetitions were prefer'd to the Select Men, signd by 198\r\nrespectable Freeholders and Inhabitants, making Mention of a\r\nReport that then prevaild, & which since appears to have been\r\nwell grounded, that Salaries were allowd to be paid to the\r\nJustices of the Superior Court of the Province by Order of the\r\nCrown; whereby they were to be made totally independent of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and absolutely dependent on the Crown; and\r\nsetting forth their Apprehensions that such an Establishment\r\nwould give a finishing Stroke to the System of Tyranny already\r\nbegun, and compleat the Ruin of the Liberties of the People. And\r\ntherefore earnestly requesting the Selectmen to call a Meeting,\r\nthat this Matter might be duly considerd by the Town, and such\r\nMeasures taken as the Necessity and Importance thereof required.\r\nWhereupon the Selectmen issued a Warrant for calling a Meeting\r\naccordingly. All which was strictly agreable to the Laws of this\r\nProvince, and the Practice of this and other Towns from the\r\nearliest times.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of this Province made in the fourth year of William &\r\nMary it is enacted, that \"when and so often as there shall be\r\nOccasion of a Town Meeting for any Business of publick\r\nConcernment to the Town there to be done, the Constable or\r\nConstables of such Town, by Order of the Selectmen or major Part\r\nof them, or of the Town Clerk by their Order in each respective\r\nTown within this Province shall warn a Meeting of such Town\" &c.2\r\nAnd by another Act made in the 2 Geo. I. it is enacted that \"When\r\nand so often as ten or more of the Freeholders of any Town shall\r\nsignify under their hands to the Selectmen their desire to have\r\nany Matter or thing inserted into a Warrant for calling a Town\r\nMeeting, the Selectmen are hereby required to insert the same in\r\nthe next Warrant they shall issue for the Calling a Town\r\nMeeting.\"3\r\n\r\nBut were there no such Laws of the Province or should our Enemies\r\npervert these & other Laws made for the same Purpose, from their\r\nplain and obvious Intent and Meaning, still there is the great\r\nand perpetual Law of Self preservation to which every natural\r\nPerson or corporate Body hath an inherent Right to recur. This\r\nbeing the Law of the Creator, no human Law can be of force\r\nagainst it: And indeed it is an Absurdity to suppose that any\r\nsuch Law could be made by Common Consent, which alone gives\r\nvalidity to human Laws. If then the \"MATTER OR THING\" viz the\r\nfixing Salaries to the Offices of the Judges of the Superior\r\nCourt as aforesaid, was such as threatned the Lives, Liberties\r\nand Properties of the People, which we have the Authority of the\r\ngreatest Assembly of the Province to affirm, The Inhabitants of\r\nthis or any other Town had certainly an uncontrovertable right to\r\nmeet together, either in the Manner the Law has prescribed, or in\r\nany other orderly Manner, joyntly to consult the necessary Means\r\nof their own Preservation and Safety. The Petitioners wisely\r\nchose the Rule of the province Law, by applying to the Selectmen\r\nfor a Meeting; and they, as it was their Dudty to do, followed\r\nthe same Rule and called a Meeting accordingly. We are therefore\r\nnot a little suprizd, that his Excellency, speaking of this and\r\nother principal Towns, should descend to such an artful Use of\r\nWords, that a \"NUMBER of Inhabitants have assembled together, and\r\nhaving ASSUMED the Name of legal Town Meetings\" &c. Thereby\r\nappearing to have a Design to lead an inattentive Reader to\r\nbelieve, that no Regard was had to the Laws of the Province in\r\ncalling these Meetings, and consequently to consider them as\r\nillegal & disorderly.\r\n\r\nThe Inhabitants being met, and for the Purpose aforesaid, the\r\nPoints determind, his Excellency says, \"were such as the Law\r\ngives the Inhabitants of Towns in their CORPORATE Capacity no\r\nPower to act upon.\" It would be a sufficient Justification of the\r\nTown to say, that no Law FORBIDS the Inhabitants of Towns in\r\ntheir corporate Capacity to determine such Points as were then\r\ndetermined. And if there was no positive legal Restraint upon\r\ntheir Conduct, it was doing them an essential injury, to\r\nrepresent it to the World as ILLEGAL. Where the Law makes no\r\nspecial Provision for the common Safety, the People have a Right\r\nto consult their own Preservation; and the necessary Means to\r\nwithstand a most dangerous attack of arbitrary Power.4 At such a\r\ntime, it is but a pitiful Objection to their thus doing, that the\r\nLaw has not expressly given them a Power to act upon such Points.\r\nThis is the very language of Tyranny: And when such Objections\r\nare offerd, to prevent the Peoples meeting together in a Time of\r\npublick Danger, it affords of it self just Grounds of Jealousy\r\nthat a Plan is laid for their Slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Town enterd upon an Inquiry into the Grounds of a Report, in\r\nwhich the common Safety was very greatly interested. They made\r\ntheir Application to the Governor, a fellow Citizen as well as\r\nthe first Magistrate of the Province; but they were informd by\r\nhis Excellency, that \"it was by no means proper for him\" \"to\r\nacquaint them whether he had or had not receivd any Advices\r\nrelating to the publick Affairs of the Government of the\r\nProvince.\" Their next Determination was, to petition the\r\nGovernor, that the General Assembly might be allowd to meet at\r\nthe time to which it them stood prorogud: But his Excellency\r\nrefused to grant this Request, lest it should be \"encouraging the\r\nInhabitants of other Towns to assemble\" \"to consider of the\r\nNecessity or Expediency of a Session of the General Assembly.\"\r\nHitherto the Town had determind upon no Point but only that of\r\npetitioning the Governor. And will his Excellency or any one else\r\naffirm, that the Inhabitants of this or any other Town, have not\r\na Right in their corporate Capacity to petition for a Session of\r\nthe General Assembly, merely because the Law of this Province,\r\nthat authorizes Towns to assemble, does not expressly make that\r\nthe Business of a Town Meeting? It is the Declaration of the Bill\r\nof Rights, founded in5 Reason, that it is the Right of the\r\nSubjects to petition the King: But it is apparent in his\r\nExcellencys Answer, that the Inhabitants of this Town were in\r\nEffect, denied, in one Instance at least, the Right of\r\npetitioning his Majestys Representative. Which was the more\r\ngrievous to them, because the Prayer of their Petition was\r\nnothing more, than that the General Assembly might have\r\nthe Opportunity of enquiring of the Governor into the Grounds of\r\nthe Report of an intollerable Grievance, which his Excellency had\r\nbefore strongly intimated to them, it was not in his Power to\r\ninform THEM of, \"consistent with Fidelity to the Trust which his\r\nMajesty had reposed in him.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been the more particular in reciting the Transactions of\r\nthat Meeting thus far, in order that the Propriety and Necessity\r\nof the further proceedings of the same Meeting may appear in a\r\ntrue Point of light.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency having thus frownd upon the reasonable Petitions\r\nof the Town; And they, having the strongest Apprehensions, that\r\nin Addition to, or rather in Consequence of other Grievances not\r\nredressd, a mortal Wound would very soon be given to the civil\r\nConstitution of the province; and no Assurance of the timely\r\nInterposition of the General Assembly, to whose Wisdom they were\r\nearnestly sollicitous to refer the whole Matter, The Town thought\r\nit expedient to state as far as they were able the Rights of the\r\nColonists & of this Province; to enumerate the Infringements on\r\nthose Rights, & in a circular Letter to each of the Towns &\r\nDistricts in the province, to submit the same to their\r\nConsideration: That the Subject might be weighd as its Importance\r\nrequired, & the collected Wisdom of the whole people as far as\r\npossible obtaind. At the same [time], NOT \"calling upon\" those\r\nTowns & Districts \"to adopt their Principles\" as his Excellency\r\nin one of his Speeches affirms, but only informing them that \"a\r\nfree Communication of THEIR Sentiments to this Town of our common\r\nDanger was earnestly sollicited & would be gratefully receivd. We\r\nmay justly affirm that the Town had a Right at that Meeting, to\r\ncommunicate their Sentiments of Matters which so nearly concernd\r\nthe publick Liberty & consequently their own Preservation. They\r\nwere matters of \"publick Concernment\" to this & every other Town\r\n& even Individual in the province. Any Attempt therefore to\r\nobstruct the Channel of publick Intelligence in this way, argues\r\nin our opinion, a Design to keep the people in Ignorance of their\r\nDanger that they may be the more easily & speedily enslaved. It\r\nis notorious to all the World, that the Liberties of this\r\nContinent & especially of this province, have been systematically\r\n& successfully invaded from Step to Step; Is it not then, to say\r\nthe least justifiable, in any Town as PART OF THE GREAT WHOLE,\r\nwhen the last Effort of Tyranny is about to be made, to spread\r\nthe earliest Notice of it far & wide, & hold up the INIQUITOUS\r\nSYSTEM in full View. It is a great Satisfaction to us, that so\r\nmany of the respectable Towns in the province, and we may add\r\nGentlemen of figure in other Colonies, have expressd, & continue\r\nto express themselves much pleasd with the Measure; and we\r\nencourage ourselves from the MANIFEST DISCOVERY of an Union of\r\nSentiments in this province, which has been one happy fruit of\r\nthe Measure, there will be the united Efforts of THE WHOLE in all\r\nconstitutional & proper Methods to prevent the entire ruin of our\r\nLiberties.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency is pleasd to say in one of his Speeches, that the\r\nTown have \"denied in the most express Terms the Supremacy of\r\nParliament.\" It is fortunate for the town that they made Choice\r\nof the very Mode of Expression, which the present House of\r\nRepresentatives in their Wisdom made use of in stating the Matter\r\nof Controversy between the Governor & them: And after what they\r\nhave advanced upon the Subject, it appears to us impossible to be\r\nshown that the Parliament of Great Britain can exercise \"the\r\nPowers of Legislation for the Colonists in all Cases whatever\"\r\nconsistently with the Rights which belong to the Colonists as Men\r\nas Christians & as Subjects, or without destroying the foundation\r\nof their own Constitution.--If the Assertion that the Parliament\r\nhath no right to exercise a Power in cases where it is plain they\r\nhave no right, hath a direct Tendency to alienate the Affections\r\nof the People from their Sovereign, because He is a constituent\r\npart of that parliament, as seems to be his Excellencys Manner of\r\nreasoning, it follows as we conceive, that there must never be a\r\ncomplaint of any assumption of power in the Parliamt, or petition\r\nfor the repeal of any Law made repugnant to the Constitution,\r\nlest it should tend to alienate the Affections of the People\r\nfrom their Sovereign; but we have a better Opinion of our fellow\r\nSubjects than to concede to such Conclusions. We are assured they\r\ncan clearly see, that a Mistake in Principle may consist with\r\nIntegrity of Heart; And for our parts we shall ever be inclined\r\nto attribute the Grievances of various Kinds which his Majestys\r\nAmerican Subjects have so long sufferd, to the Weakness or\r\nWickedness of his Ministers & Servants, and not to any\r\nDisposition in HIM to injure them. And we yet perswade our selves\r\nthat could the Petitions of his much aggrievd Subjects be\r\ntransmitted to his Majesty thro the Hands of an honest impartial\r\nMinister, we should not fail of ample redress.\r\n\r\nHis Excellencys Argument seems to us to be rather straind, when\r\nhe is attempting to show, that we have \"invited every other Town\r\n& District to adopt our Principles\". It is this. The Town says If\r\nit should be the general Voice of the Province that the Rights as\r\nstated do not belong [to] them, trusting however that this cannot\r\nbe the Case, they shall lament the Extinction of Ardor for civil\r\n& religious Liberty; THEREFORE says his Excellency The Town\r\ninvited them to ADOPT their principles. Could it possibly be\r\nsupposd that when his Excy had declared to the whole Province\r\nthat we had invited every other Town and District in the province\r\nto adopt the same Principles he intended to avail himself of such\r\nan Explanation! Much the same Way of reasoning follows, (though\r\nit would not be to the Reputation of the other Towns if it should\r\nhave any Weight). That because THEIR consequent Doings were\r\nsimilar to those of this Town THEREFORE they understood that they\r\nwere invited to ADOPT the same Principles, & therefore they were\r\nthus invited to adopt them.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, There can be no room to doubt but that every Town\r\nwhich has thought it expedient to correspond with this on the\r\nOccasion have acted their own Judgment & expressd their own\r\nprinciples: It is an unspeakeable Satisfaction to us that their\r\nSentiments so nearly accord with ours, and it adds a Dignity to\r\nour Proceedings, that when the House of Representatives were\r\ncalled upon by the Governor to bear their Testimony against them,\r\nas \"of a dangerous Nature & Tendency,\" they saw reason to declare\r\nthat \"they had not discoverd that the Principles advanced by the\r\nTown of Boston were unwarrantable by the constitution.\"6\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Report was accepted in the Meeting, Nemine\r\nContradicente, and ordered to be recorded in the Town's Book, as\r\nthe Sense of the Inhabitants of this Town.\r\n\r\nIt was also Voted, That said Report be printed in the several\r\nNews-Papers, and that the Committee of Correspondence be directed\r\nto transmit a printed Copy thereof to such Towns and Districts as\r\nthey have or may correspond with.\r\n\r\nAttest.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COOPER, Town-Clerk.\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n1The preceding portion is in the Gazette, but not in the\r\nmanuscript draft.\r\n\r\n2Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, vol. i.,\r\npp. 64, 68.\r\n\r\n3Ibid., p. 30.\r\n\r\n4At this point the draft originally included the words: \"when\r\nthey see it approaching them with hasty Strides.\"\r\n\r\n5At this point the draft originally included the words: \"Nature\r\nand.\"\r\n\r\n6The following portion, from the Gazette is not in the autograph\r\ndraft by Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, March 27 1773\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI take the Liberty of inclosing an Oration delivered by Dr\r\nBenjamin Church on the Anniversary of the 5th of March 1770,\r\nwhich I beg the favor of you to accept.\r\n\r\nThe Proceedings of our General Assembly at their last Session,\r\nyou may perhaps have seen in the News papers. Our Governor in a\r\nmanner forcd the Assembly to express their Sentiments of so\r\ndelicate though important a Subject as the supreme Authority of\r\nthe Parliament of Great Britain over the Colonies. The Silence of\r\nthe other Assemblies of late upon every Subject that concerns the\r\njoynt Interest of the Colonies, renderd it somewhat difficult to\r\ndetermine what to say with Propriety. As the Sense of the\r\nColonies might possibly be drawn from what might be advanced by\r\nthis Province, you will easily conceive, that the Assembly would\r\nrather have chosen to have been silent till the Sentiments of at\r\nleast Gentlemen of Eminence out of this province could be known;\r\nat the same time that Silence would have been construed as the\r\nAcknowledgment of the Governor's Principles and a Submission to\r\nthe fatal Effects of them. What will be the Consequence of this\r\nControversy, Time must determine. If the Governor enterd into it\r\nof his own Motion, as I am apt to believe he did, he may not have\r\nthe Approbation of the Ministry for counteracting what appears to\r\nme to have been for two years past their favorite Design, to keep\r\nthe Americans quiet & lull them into Security. Could your Health\r\nor Leisure admit of it, a publication of your Sentiments on this\r\n& other Matters of the most interresting Importance would be of\r\nsubstantial Advantage to your Country. Your Candor will excuse\r\nthe freedom I take in this repeated Request. An Individual has\r\nsome Right, in behalf of the publick, still to urge the\r\nAssistance of those who have heretofore approvd themselves its\r\nablest advocates.\r\n\r\nI shall take it as a favor if you will present the other inclosed\r\nOration to Mr Reed, whom I once had the pleasure of conversing\r\nwith in this place, & to whom I would have wrote by this\r\nunexpected Opportunity, but am prevented by the Hurry of the\r\nBearer.\r\n\r\nI am Sir with sincere Regards\r\nYour most humble servt\r\n\r\nMr J[osiah] Q[uincy] a young Gentl but eminent here in the\r\nprofession of the law is soon expected to arrive at Philadelphia\r\nfrom South Carolina.

The agreable manner in which you have communicated to\r\nus their Sentiments lays [us] under great obligation.

It affords us an unspeakeable Satisfaction to find so\r\ngreat a Number of the Towns & Districts in the province\r\nexpressing a just Resentment at the repeated Attacks that have\r\nbeen made on the publick Liberty by a corrupt Administration and\r\ntheir wretched Tools & Dependents. Your District, in the Opinion\r\nof this Committee has very justly held up the publick Grievances\r\nof America in one short but full View; first the power assumed by\r\nthe British parliament (in which we cannot be represented) to tax\r\nus at pleasure; and then their appropriating such taxes, to\r\nrender the executive power of the province independent of the\r\nLegislature, or more properly speaking absolutely dependent on\r\nthe Crown. It was impossible for the Conspirators against our\r\ninvalueable Rights, with all their Art & Assiduity, to prevent\r\nour sensible Brethren in the Country from seeing the fatal\r\nTendency of so dangerous an Innovation: And in a Virtuous Country\r\nit requires only a Sight of such daring Incroachments, to produce\r\na manly & effectual Opposition to them. We applaud the patriotick\r\nDetermination of the District of Rutland \"that it is of the\r\nutmost Importance that the Inhabitants of this province stand\r\nfirm as one man to support & maintain all their just Rights &\r\nPrivileges.\" Such a resolution when general among the people can\r\nseldom fail to reduce the most haughty Invaders of the common\r\nRights to a Submission to Reason.\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n1Clerk of the District of Rutland, Worcester County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO THOMAS MIGHILL.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, April 7 1773\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nWe the Committee of Correspondence for the Town of Boston,\r\nacknowledge the very obliging Letter to said town, signd by\r\nyourself & transmitted to us by order of the Town of Rowley.\r\n\r\nIt gives us great pleasure to find that the proceedings of the\r\nTown we have the Honor to serve, have been so acceptable to our\r\nworthy & much esteemed Brethren of Rowley.

H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp.\r\n197-203; printed also in the Boston Gazette, May 23, 1774.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, 9 April 1773\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI must by no means omit to request you to present my most\r\nrespectful Complimts to the Society of the Bill of Rights and\r\nreturn them my hearty Thanks for the great Honor they have done\r\nme in admitting me one of their Members. The Gentlemen may be\r\nassured that this unexpected mark of their Respect adds to the\r\nObligation which I have ever held myself under, to employ the\r\nsmall Share of Ability which God has given me, in vindicating\r\nthe Rights of my Country & Mankind.\r\n\r\nI can now assure you, that the Efforts of this Town at their\r\nMeeting in November last, have had Effects which are extremely\r\nmortifying to our petty Tyrants. Every Art & every Instrument was\r\nmade use of to prevent the Meetings of the Towns in the Country\r\nbut to no purpose. It is no Wonder that a Measure calculated to\r\npromote a Correspodence and a free Communication among the\r\npeople, should awaken Apprehensions; for they well know that it\r\nmust detect their Falshood in asserting that the people of this\r\nCountry were satisfied with the Measures of the British\r\nparliament and the Administration of Government. Our Governor has\r\nin my Opinion merited greatly of the Ministry by his constant\r\nEndeavors, though in vain, to sooth & quiet the people & perswade\r\nthem to think there were no Grievances that might \"be seen felt\r\nor understood.\" And when the House of Representatives in the last\r\nMay Session, by almost a unanimous Vote remonstrated against his\r\nIndependency, he, without the least Foundation in Truth, & for no\r\nother Reason that I can conceive but to give Countenance to his\r\nPatron Hillsborough, or to establish himself in his Governmt\r\nwhich he recd with so great RELUCTANCE, did not scruple in his\r\nSpeech at the Close of that Session, to insinuate that the House\r\nwas under the Influence of a few factious members. No Speech of\r\nBernards ever gave greater Disgust to the People, nor with more\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThere has been another Session of the Genl Assembly, wch began\r\nunexpectedly on the 6th of Jany last. It is my Opinion that it\r\nwould have been postponed, as usual of late, till near the Close\r\nof our political Year, had it not been for the Boston Town\r\nMeeting; I mean to prevent the designd Effects of it, by giving\r\nan occasion to the small Jobbers in the Country to say, that\r\n\"however expedient it might have been for them to have had their\r\nmeetings before, it now becomes unnecessary & improper since\r\ntheir representatives are soon to meet in Genl Assembly.\" This\r\nhad an Influence in some Towns; and his EXCELLENCY, I suppose\r\njudgd it more probable that he should be able to mannage the\r\nMembers of the House and prevail upon them \"to joyn with him in\r\nbearing Testimony against the UNWARRANTABLE Proceedings of\r\nBoston,\" if they came together without having the explicit\r\nSentiments of their Constituents.\r\n\r\nAt the Meeting of the Assembly, he thought proper to open a\r\nControversy with the two Houses, for which I think Hillsbro would\r\nnot thank him; for he has thereby defeated the favorite Design of\r\nthe Ministry, which was to lull the people into Security, and for\r\nthe effecting of which Design, he had before thought himself, or\r\nendeavord to make Administration believe he was entitled to so\r\ngreat a Share of Merit. It has been publishd in most of the\r\nNewspapers in the Continent & engages much of the Attention of\r\nthe other Colonies. This, together with ye proceedings of a\r\nCONTEMPTIBLE Town meeting, has awakned the Jealousy of all, & has\r\nparticularly raised ye Spirit of the most ancient & patriotick\r\nColony of Virginia. Their manly Resolves have been transmitted to\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives in a printed Sheet of\r\ntheir Journals; and our Come of Correspondence have circulated\r\nCopies of them into every Town & District through the Province.1\r\n\r\nI wish I could hear more of Lord D. to qualify him for his high\r\noffice, than merely that he is a GOOD Man. Goodness I confess is\r\nan essential, tho too rare a Qualification of a Minister of\r\nState. Possibly I may not have been informd of the whole of his\r\nLordships Character. Without a Greatness of Mind adequate to the\r\nImportance of his Station, I fear he may find himself embarrassd\r\nwith his present Connections. It can easily be conceivd what\r\nprinciple induced Lord North to recommend to that Department a\r\nNobleman characterized in America for Piety; but what could\r\nprevail on his Lordship to joyn with such Connections, unless he\r\nhad a Consciousness that his own Abilities were sufficient to\r\ndefeat the plans of a corrupt Administration, I am not able to\r\nconceive. It might be well for his Lordship to be assured, that\r\nthere is now a fairer prospect than ever of an Union among the\r\nColonies, which his predecessor did & had reason to dread, tho he\r\naffected to despise it. Should the Correspondence proposd by\r\nVirginia produce a Congress; and that an ASSEMBLY OF STATES, it\r\nwould require the Head of a very able Minister to treat with so\r\nrespectable a Body. This perhaps is a mere fiction in the Mind of\r\na political Enthusiast. Ministers of State are not to be disturbd\r\nwith Dreams.\r\n\r\nI must now acknowledge your agreeable Letter of the 24 of Decr.2\r\nI cannot wonder that you almost depair of the British Nation. Can\r\nthat people be saved from Ruin, who carry their Liberties to\r\nmarket & sell them to the highest Bidder? But America \"shall rise\r\nfull plumed and glorious from her Mothers Ashes.\"\r\n\r\nOur House of Representatives have sent a Letter to Lord\r\nDartmouth. This must without Question be a wise measure, though I\r\nmust own I was not in it. I feard it would lead the people to a\r\nfalse Dependence; I mean upon a Minister of State, when it ought\r\nto be placed, with Gods Assistance, upon THEMSELVES. You cannot\r\nbetter prepare him for the representatives of the House, than as\r\nyou propose, by giving him a proper Idea of Hutchinson. I am much\r\nobligd to you for your Intention to hold up to the publick the\r\nGenerosity of my esteemed friend Mr. Otis. I wish I could assure\r\nyou that he is perfectly recoverd.\r\n\r\nApril 12.\r\n\r\nThis day I have the pleasure of receiving yours of the 25 of\r\nJany.3 Your putting me in mind of the Honor done me by the\r\nSociety of the Bill of Rights is very kind. I ought sooner to\r\nhave acknowledgd it. My omitting it was owing to being in a Hurry\r\nwhen I last wrote to you. I am sensible I am not one of the most\r\nregular Correspondents; perhaps not so as I should be. I duly\r\nrecd tho I think not by Mr Storey, the Letter which inclosed the\r\nAnswer to the Resolution of the Govr & Council against Junius\r\nAmericanus, which I immediately publishd in the Boston Gazette.\r\nIt was read with great Satisfaction by Men of Sense & Virtue. I\r\nam heartily glad to find that the proceedings of this Town are so\r\npleasing to you. I have heard that Ld Dartmouth recd one of our\r\npamphlets with Coolness & expressd his Concern that the Town had\r\ncome into such Measures. His Lordship probably will be much\r\nsurprizd to find a very great Number of the Towns in this\r\nprovince(& the Number is daily increasing)concurring fully in\r\nSentiments with this Metropolis; expressing Loyalty to the King &\r\nAffection to the Mother Country but at the same time a firm\r\nResolution to maintain their constitutional Rights & Liberties. I\r\nsend you the proceedings of one town, which if you think proper\r\nyou may publish as a Specimen of the whole, for the Inspection of\r\nan Administration either misinformd & credulous to the greatest\r\nDegree of human Weakness, or Obstinate in wilfull Error. They\r\nhave lately employd Eight Regiments of British Troops to bring an\r\nhandful of unfortunate Carribs to a Treaty dishonorable to the\r\nNation. How many Regiments will be thought necessary to penetrate\r\nthe Heart of a populus Country & subdue a sensible enlightned &\r\nbrave people to the ignominious Terms of Slavery? Or will his\r\nLordships superior Wisdom direct to more salutory Measures, and\r\nby establishing Freedom in every part of the Kings extensive\r\nDominions, restore that mutual Harmony & Affection which alone is\r\nwanting to build up the greatest Empire the World has ever yet\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkes was certainly misinformd when he was told that Mr H.\r\nhad deserted the Cause of Liberty. Great pains had been taken to\r\nhave it thought to be so; and by a scurvy Trick of lying the\r\nAdversaries effected a Coolness between that Gentn & some others\r\nwho were zealous in that Cause. But it was of short Continuance,\r\nfor their falsehood was soon detected. Lord Hillsbro I suppose\r\nwas early informd of this imaginary Conquest; for I have it upon\r\nsuch Grounds as I can rely upon, that he wrote to the Govr\r\ntelling him that he had it in Command from the HIGHEST AUTHORITY\r\nto enjoyn him to promote Mr H. upon every Occasion. Accordingly,\r\ntho he had been before frownd upon & often negativd both by\r\nBernard & Hutchinson the latter, who can smile sweetly even upon\r\nthe Man he hates, when he is instructed or it is his Interest so\r\nto do, fawnd & flatterd one of the HEADS OF THE FACTION, & at\r\nlength approvd of him when he was elected a Councellor last May.\r\nTo palliate this inconsistent Conduct it was previously given out\r\nthat Mr H had deserted the faction, & became as they term each\r\nother, a Friend to Governmt. But he had Spirit enough to refuse a\r\nSeat at the Board, & continue a Member of the House, where he has\r\nin every Instance joyned with the friends of the Constituion in\r\nOpposition to the Measures of a Corrupt Administration; & in\r\nparticular no one has discoverd more firmness against the\r\nIndependency of the Govr & the Judges than he.\r\n\r\nI have mentiond to Mr Cushing the Hint in your last concerning\r\nhis not answering your Letter. I believe he will write to you\r\nsoon. The Gratitude of the friends to Liberty towards Mr Otis for\r\nhis eminent Services in times past induces them to take all\r\nOccasions to show him Respect. I am much obligd to you for the\r\nfriendship you have discoverd for him, in holding up to the View\r\nof the Publick his Generosity to Robinson.\r\n\r\nYour Brother in Virginia has lately honord me with a Letter; & I\r\nintend to Cultivate a Correspondence with him, which I am sure\r\nwill be much to my Advantage.\r\n\r\nAs you have confided in me to recommend one or more Gentlemen of\r\nthis place as Candidates for the Society of the Bill of Rights, I\r\nmy two worthy & intimate Friends J Adams & J Warren Esqrs; the\r\none eminent in the profession of the Law & the other equally so\r\nin that of physick. Both of them men of an unblemishd moral\r\nCharacter & Zealous Advocates for the Common Rights of Mankind.\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n1An original print of this circular letter, dated April 9, 1773,\r\nis in the Lenox Library.\r\n2R.

H. Lee,\r\nLife of Richard Henry Lee, vol. I., pp. 88-90, and a draft in in\r\nthe Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, April 10 1773\r\n\r\nSIR---\r\n\r\nYour Letter to me of the 4th Feb last, I receivd with singular\r\nPleasure; not only because I had long wishd for a Correspondence\r\nwith some Gentleman in Virginia, but more particularly because I\r\nhad frequently heard of your Character and Merit, as a warm\r\nAdvocate for Virtue and Liberty.\r\n\r\nI have often thought it a Misfortune, or rather a Fault in the\r\nFriends of American Independence and Freedom, their not taking\r\nCare to open every Channel of Communication. The Colonies are all\r\nembarkd in the same bottom. The Liberties of all are alike\r\ninvaded by the same haughty Power: The Conspirators against their\r\ncommon Rights have indeed exerted their brutal Force, or applied\r\ntheir insidious Arts, differently in the several Colonies, as\r\nthey thought would best serve their Purpose of Oppression and\r\nTyranny. How necessary then is it; that ALL should be early\r\nacquainted with the particular Circumstances of EACH, in Order\r\nthat the Wisdom & Strength of the whole may be employd upon every\r\nproper Occasion. We have heard of Bloodshed & even civil War in\r\nour Sister Colony North Carolina; And how strange is it, that the\r\nbest Intelligence we have had of that tragical Scene, has been\r\nbrought to us from England!\r\n\r\nThis Province, and this Town especially, have sufferd a great\r\nShare of Ministerial Wrath and Insolence: But God be thanked,\r\nthere is, I trust, a Spirit prevailing, which will never submit\r\nto Slavery. The Compliance of New York in making annual Provision\r\nfor a military Force designed to carry Acts of Tyranny into\r\nExecution: The Timidity of some Colonies and the Silence of\r\nothers is discouraging: But the active Vigilance, the manly\r\nGenerosity and the Steady Perseverance of Virginia and South\r\nCarolina, gives us Reason to hope, that the Fire of true\r\nPatriotism will at length spread throughout the Continent; the\r\nConsequence of which must be the Acquisition of all we wish for.\r\n\r\nThe Friends of Liberty in this Town have lately made a successful\r\nAttempt to obtain the explicit political Sentiments of a great\r\nNumber of the Towns in this Province; and the Number is daily\r\nincreasing. The very Attempt was alarming to the Adversaries; and\r\nthe happy Effects of it are mortifying to them. I would propose\r\nit for your Consideration, Whether the Establishment of\r\nCommittees of Correspondence among the several Towns in every\r\nColony, would not tend to promote that General Union, upon which\r\nthe Security of the whole depends.\r\n\r\nThe Reception of the truly patriotick Resolves of the House of\r\nBurgesses of Virginia gladdens the Hearts of all who are Friends\r\nto Liberty. Our Committee of Correspondence had a special Meeting\r\nupon this Occasion, and determined immediately to circulate\r\nprinted Copies in every Town in this Province, in order to make\r\nthem as extensively useful as possible. I am desired by them to\r\nassure you of their Veneration for your most ancient Colony, and\r\ntheir unfeigned Esteem for the Gentlemen of your Committee. This\r\nindeed is a small Return; I hope you will have the hearty\r\nConcurence of every Assembly on the Continent. It is a Measure\r\nthat I think must be attended with great and good Consequences.\r\n\r\nOur General Assembly is dissolved; and Writs will soon be issued\r\naccording to the Charter for a new Assembly to be held on the\r\nlast Wednesday in May next. I think I may almost assure you that\r\nthere will be a Return of such Members as will heartily cooperate\r\nwith you in your spirited Measures.\r\n\r\nThe most enormous Stride in erecting what may properly be called\r\na Court of Inquisition in America, is sufficient to excite\r\nIndignation even in the Breast the least capable of feeling. I am\r\nexpecting an authentick Copy of that Commission, which I shall\r\nsend to you by the first opportunity after I shall have receivd\r\nit. The Letter from the new Secretary of State to the Governor of\r\nRhode Island, which possibly you may have seen in the News\r\npapers, may be depended upon as genuine. I receivd it from a\r\nGentleman of the Council in that Colony, who took it from the\r\nOriginal. I wish the Assembly of that little Colony had acted\r\nwith more firmness than they have done; but as the Court of\r\nEnquiry is adjournd, they may possibly have another Tryal.\r\n\r\nI have a thousand things to say to you, but am prevented by Want\r\nof Time; having had but an hours Notice of this Vessels sailing.\r\nI cannot however conclude without assuring you, that a Letter\r\nfrom you as often as your Leisure will permit of it, will lay me\r\nunder great\r\nObligations.---\r\n\r\nI am in strict Truth\r\nSir\r\nYour most humble servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, April 12, 1773.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nPERHAPS no measure that has been taken by the Town of Boston\r\nduring our present Struggles for Liberty, has thwarted the\r\ndesigns of our enemies more than their Votes and Proceedings on\r\nthe 20th of November last.1 If we take a Retrospect of two or\r\nthree Years past, we shall find that what our \"PRETENDED\r\npatriots\", as they were stiled in the Court Gazette, so zealously\r\nforewarn'd us of, has since turn'd out to be a Fact; that every\r\nart would be made use of to lull the people of this Province and\r\nContinent into Security, in order that the Conspirators against\r\nour Rights and Liberties might carry on their Schemes and\r\ncompleat their system of Tyranny without Opposition or\r\nMolestation. The first part of their plan, they imagin'd they had\r\nfinish'd; that is, the Establishment of a Revenue: And though\r\nthis was far from being sufficient to answer their whole purpose,\r\nthey thought that if they could put the people to sleep, they\r\nmight the more easily add to this revenue, at some future time,\r\nand plead the present submission for a precedent. They therefore\r\nbegan upon the second and equally important part of their plan,\r\nwhich was to appropriate the revenue they had rais'd, to set up\r\nan Executive, absolutely independent of the legislative, which is\r\nto say the least, the nearest approach to absolute Tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, who was the first American PENSIONER, had now an\r\nexhorbitant Salary allowed him out of the monies extorted from\r\nthe people: And although this was directly repugnant to the\r\nobvious meaning, if not the very letter of the Charter, much was\r\nsaid by CHRONUS and the Tribe of ministerial Writers in Mr.\r\nDRAPER'S paper, to reconcile it to the people. But the people,\r\nwhom they generally in their incubrations treated with an air of\r\ncontempt, as an unthinking herd, had a better understanding of\r\nthings than they imagined they had. They were almost universally\r\ndisgusted with the Innovation, while the advocates for it were\r\nyet endeavoring to make the world believe, that the opposition to\r\nit arose from a few men only, of \"no property\" and \"desperate\r\nfortunes,\" who were \"endeavoring to bring things into confusion,\r\nthat they might have the advantage of bettering their fortunes\r\nby plunder.\" Little did they think that it was then known, as it\r\nnow appears in fact, that those who were assiduously watching for\r\nplaces, preferment and pensions, were in truth the very men of NO\r\nPROPERTY, and had no other way of mending thier shattered\r\nfortunes, but by being the sharers in the spoils of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the General Assembly the opportunity of expressing\r\ntheir full Sentiments of the mischievous tendency, of having a\r\nGovernor absolutely dependent on the Crown for his being and\r\nsupport, before the alarming News arriv'd of the Judges of the\r\nSuperior Court being placed in the same Situation. This Insolence\r\nof Administration was so quickly repeated, no doubt from a full\r\nperswasion of the truth of the accounts received from their\r\ninfatuated tools on this side of the atlantick, that the temper\r\nof the people would now admit of the experiment. But the News was\r\nlike Thunder in the ears of all but a detestable and detested\r\nfew: Even those who had been inclin'd to think favorably of the\r\nGovernor and the Judges were alarm'd at it. And indeed what\r\nhonest and sensible man or woman could contemplate it without\r\nhorror! We all began to shudder at the Prospect of the same\r\ntragical Scenes being acted in this Country, which are recorded\r\nin the English History as having been acted when their Judges\r\nwere the meer Creatures, Dependents and tools of the Crown. Such\r\nan indignation was discover'd and express'd by almost every one,\r\nat so daring an Insult upon a free people, that it was difficult\r\nto keep our Resentment within its proper bounds. Many were ready\r\nto call for immediate Vengeance, perhaps with more zeal than\r\ndiscretion: How soon human Prudence and Fortitude, directed by\r\nthe wise and righteous Governor of the world, may point out the\r\ntime and the means of successfully revenging the wrongs of\r\nAmerica, I leave to those who have been the Contrivers and\r\nAbbettors of these destructive Measures, seriously to consider. I\r\nhope and believe that I live in a Country, the People of which\r\nare too intelligent and too brave to submit to Tyrants: And let\r\nme remind the greatest of them all, \"there is a degree of\r\npatience beyond which human Nature will not bear\"!\r\n\r\nAmidst the general Anxiety the memorable Meeting was called, with\r\nDesign that the Inhabitants might have the Opportunity, of\r\nexpressing their Sense calmly and dispassionately; for it is from\r\nsuch a Temper of Mind, that we are to expect a rational, manly\r\nand successful Opposition to the ruinous Plans of an abandoned\r\nAdministration: And it is for this Reason alone, that the petty\r\nTyrants of this Country have always dreaded and continue still to\r\ndread, a regular Assembly of the People.\r\n\r\nThe desirable Effects of this Meeting, contemptible as it was at\r\nfirst represented to be, together with the Prospect of what may\r\nbe further expected from it, my possibly be the subject of a\r\nfuture Paper.\r\n\r\nYour's,\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\nApril 10, 1773.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Volume II., page 350.

Nothing can afford us greater pleasure than to find\r\nso noble a Spirit of Opposition to the Efforts of arbitrary power\r\nprevailing in so great a number of Towns in this province. And it\r\ngives us a particular Satisfaction that our worthy Brethren of\r\nDuxborough, who are settled upon the very spot which was first\r\ncultivated by our renowned Ancestors, inherit so great a Share of\r\ntheir heroick Virtues. It is as you justly observe an Affront to\r\nthe Understanding of our Ancestors to suppose, that when they\r\ntook possession of this Country, they consented, even tacitly, to\r\nbe subject to the unlimited Controul of a Government without a\r\nVoice in it, the merciless Oppression of which was intollerable\r\neven when they had a Voice there. Your just Resentment of the\r\nInjuries done to us by the British parliament more especially in\r\ngiving & granting our property & appropriating it to the most\r\ndestructive purposes, without our Consent, and your resolution to\r\noppose Tyranny in all its forms is worthy the Imitation of this\r\nMetropolis. We wish for & hope soon to see that Union of\r\nSentiments in the several Towns throughout this province & in the\r\nAmerican Colonies which shall strike a Terror in the hearts of\r\nthose who would enslave us; and together with a Spirit of union\r\nmay God inspire us with that ardent Zeal for the support of\r\nreligious & civil Liberty which animated the Breasts of the first\r\nSettlers of the old Colony of Plymouth from whom the native\r\nInhabitants of Duxborough have lineally descended. After the\r\nExample of those renowned Heroes, whose memory we revere, let us\r\ngloriously defend our Rights & Liberites, & resolve to transmit\r\nthe fair Inheritance they purchased for us with Treasure & Blood\r\nto their latest posterity.\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Town Clerk of Duxbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO EZRA WHITMARSH.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\n[April 13, 1773.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nThe Selectmen of this Town have handed to us an attested Copy of\r\na letter directed to them by order of the ancient Town of\r\nWeymouth.

The Town of Boston are deeply sensible\r\nthat our publick Affairs as you justly observe are in a critical\r\nScituation: yet our Intention was, not to obtrude THEIR Opinions\r\nupon their Fellow-Countrymen, as has been injuriously said, but\r\nto be informd, if possible of their real Sentiments, at a time\r\nwhen it was publickly & repeatedly given out that this Country in\r\ngeneral was perfectly reconciled to the measures of the British\r\nAdministration. It affords us pleasure to find it to be the Sense\r\nof the Town of Weymouth that \"Encroachments are made upon our\r\nRights & Liberties,\" & that they are \"disposed at all times to\r\nunite in every lawful & proper measure for obtaining a redress of\r\nour Grievances.\" Many of the Towns in this province have expressd\r\na just Abhorrence of the Attempts that have been & still are made\r\nto deprive us of our inestimable rights. Their good Sense &\r\ngenerous Zeal for the common Liberty is highly animating & we\r\nwould wish to emulate it. We are sensible that \"much Wisdom is\r\nnecessary to conduct us right,\" and we joyn in earnestly\r\nsupplicating \"that Wisdom which is from above.\" The Friendship to\r\nthis Town expressd in your Letter lays us under great\r\nObligations. No greater Blessing can be desired by this Community\r\nthan \"Peace Prosperity & Happiness,\" and the Enjoyment of this\r\nBlessing depends upon CIVIL & RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Town Clerk of Weymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO JOSEPH NORTH.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, April 13 1773\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nThe Votes of the plantation of Gardnerstown have been laid before\r\nthe Committee of Correspondence of the Town of Boston by Mr\r\nSamuel Adams to whom you were so kind as to transmit them. The\r\nnotice which your plantation have taken of the State of the\r\nRights & Grievances of this people publishd by this metropolis\r\ngives us great pleasure.

We\r\nwish you the Blessings of Heaven in your Settlement; and we will\r\nexert our small Share of Influence in getting you protected from\r\nthe savage hand of Tyranny, with which the whole British America\r\nhas so long been contending.

H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 203, 204.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, April 22nd. 1773.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY ESTEEMED FRIEND,---I have written you a long epistle by this\r\nconveyance, and yet as the vessel is detained by a contrary wind,\r\nI cannot help indulging the mood I am in to chat a little more\r\nwith you. When I mentioned Mr. Hancock in my last, I forgot to\r\ntell you that he is colonel of a company, called the governor's\r\ncompany of cadets. Perhaps in this view only he was held up to\r\nMr. Wilkes, when he was informed that he had deserted the cause.\r\nBut it should be known it is not in the power of the governor to\r\ngive a commission for that company to whom he pleases as their\r\nofficers are chosen by themselves. Mr. Hancock was elected by an\r\nunanimous vote; and a reluctance at the idea of giving offence to\r\nan hundred gentlemen, might very well account for the governor\r\ngiving the commission to Mr. H., without taking into\r\nconsideration that most powerful of all other motives, AN\r\nINSTRUCTION, especially at a time when he vainly hoped he should\r\ngain him over. I have been the more particular, because I know\r\nour adversaries avail themselves much by propagating reports that\r\npersons who have signalized themselves as patriots have at length\r\nforsaken their country. Mr. Otis yesterday was engaged in a cause\r\nin the admiralty on the side of Dawson, commander of one of the\r\nking's cutters. At this some of the minions of power triumph, and\r\nsay they have got over to their side the greatest champion of our\r\ncause. I have not yet discovered in the faces of their masters,\r\nan air of exultation at this event; and indeed how can they boast\r\nof the acquisition of one, whom they themselves have been the\r\nmost ready to expose as distracted.\r\n\r\nI send you a complete printed copy of our controversy with the\r\ngovernor, at the end of which you will observe some errors noted\r\nwhich escaped the press.\r\n\r\nThis letter goes under care of Mr. Cushing's to Dr. Franklin. The\r\nfranks you favoured me with I shall make use of as necessity\r\nshall require.\r\n\r\nI am yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 204, 205.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON, May 6th, 1773.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,---My last letter to you I sent by Capt. Symmes, who\r\nsailed a few days ago. This town met yesterday, and made choice\r\nof their representatives for the year ensuing. Enclosed is a copy\r\nof the town's instructions.1 It is a very common practice for\r\nthis town to instruct their representatives; which among other\r\ngood purposes serves to communicate their sentiments and spirit\r\nto the other towns, and may be looked upon as fresh appeals to\r\nthe world. I perceive by the late London newspapers that the\r\ngovernor's first speech had arrived there, and had been very\r\nsensibly remarked upon by Junius Americanus. This warm and\r\njudicious advocate for the province I apprehend was mistaken in\r\nsaying, that the supreme authority of the British parliament to\r\nlegislate forces has been always acknowledged here; when he reads\r\nthe answer of the house to the speech, he will find the contrary\r\nclearly shown, even from Gov. Hutchinson's history. What will be\r\nthe consequence of this controversy, time must discover; it must\r\nbe placed to the credit of the governor, that he has quickened a\r\nspirit of enquiry into the nature and end of government, and the\r\nconnexion of the colonies with Great Britain, which has for some\r\ntime past been prevailing among the people. MAGNA EST VERITAS ET\r\nPREVALEBIT; I believe it will be hardly in the power even of that\r\npowerful nation to hold so inquisitive and increasing a people\r\nlong in a state of slavery.\r\n\r\nPray write to me as often as you can find leisure, and be assured\r\nI am sincerely your friend and servant,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1The text is in Boston Record Commissioner's Report, vol. xviii.,\r\npp. 131-134.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SELECTMEN OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n[W.

Our General Assembly will\r\nmeet next Week, what kind of a Budget the Govr will then open is\r\nuncertain; It is whispered that he intends to bring about a\r\nCoalition of parties, but how he will attempt it I am at a loss\r\nto conceive. Surely he cannot think that the Body of this people\r\nwill be quieted till there is an End put to the Oppressions they\r\nare under; and he dares not to propose a Coalition on these Terms\r\nbecause it would disgust those who are the Instruments of &\r\nSharers in the Oppression. Besides I am inclined to think he\r\nnever will be able to recover so much of the Confidence of the\r\npeople as to make his Administration easy. A few of his Letters\r\nwe have seen, but are restraind at present from publishing them.\r\nCould they be made generally known, his Friends must desert him.\r\nIt is a pity when the most important Intelligence is communicated\r\nwith such Restrictions, as that it serves rather to gratify the\r\nCuriosity of a few than to promote the publick good. I wish we\r\ncould see the Letters he has written since his Advancement to the\r\nGovernment. His friends give out that they are replete with\r\ntenderness to the province; If so, I SPEAK WITH ASSURANCE, they\r\nare the reverse of those he wrote before.\r\n\r\nI send you for your Amusement the Copy of a Vote passd by this\r\nTown at the Adjournment of their Meeting a few days ago and\r\nremain with Sincerity your friend.\r\n\r\nYou cannot write me too often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R.

In the mean time believe me to be with\r\ngreat esteem your unfeigned friend,\r\n\r\nWednesday, June 16th, 1773.---The enclosed resolves are to be\r\nconsidered by the house this afternoon.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1See Journal of the House of Representatives, 1773-1774, under\r\ndates of June 2, 3, 10, 16, 21, 22, 26, 28, 1773; cf.\r\nBigelow, Complete Works of Benjamin Franklin, vol. v., pp. 147-\r\n150, 152, 153, 205-207.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO ELIJAH MORTON.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON June 19 1773\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nThe judicious and manly Resolves of the Town of Hatfield, passd\r\nat the Adjournment of a legal meeting on the 31 of May last, have\r\nbeen laid before the Come of Correspondence for the Town of\r\nBoston. It affords us very great Satisfaction to find that the\r\nAttempts of this Town to state the common Rights of this Colony &\r\nthe many grievances we labor under have been judgd by our\r\nBrethren of Hatfield to be an acceptable Service; and the Thanks\r\nof that Town does great Honor to the metropolis. It has been the\r\nunremitted Endeavor of the Invaders of our Rights & the Tools\r\nthey have employed, to prevail on the people to believe that\r\nthere have been no Infringements made upon them; and the artful\r\nPublications which have frequently issued from one of the presses\r\nin this Town in particular, had perhaps in some degree answerd\r\ntheir purpose. But we have the pleasure to assure you, that the\r\nLetters we have lately receivd from every part of the province,\r\nbreath the true Sentiments & Spirit of Liberty. There seems to be\r\nin every town, an apprehension of fatal Consequences from \"the\r\nillegal & unconstitutional measures which have been ADOPTED, (as\r\nyou justly express it) by the British ministry.\" Your Expression\r\nis indeed pertinent; for it has as we think abundantly appeard\r\nsince you wrote, by some extraordinary Letters which have been\r\npublishd, that the plan of our Slavery was concerted here, &\r\nproperly speaking \"adopted by the British ministry.\" The plan\r\nindeed is concise; first to take the people's money from them\r\nwithout their Consent & then to appropriate that money for the\r\npurpose of supporting an Executive independent of them and under\r\nthe absolute Controul of the Crown or rather the ministry. It was\r\nformerly the saying of an English Tyrant \"Let me have Judges at\r\nmy Command & make what Laws you please.\" And herein he judgd\r\nwisely for his purpose, for what Security can the people expect\r\nfrom the most salutary Laws if they are to be executed by the\r\nabsolute Dependents of a monarch. The nation cannot then wonder\r\nthat not only the several Towns of this province in their more\r\nprivate Departments, but the Representative body of the people in\r\nGeneral Court assembled, are so greatly alarmd at this finishing\r\nStroke of the System of Tyranny. That Union of Sentiments among\r\nthe freemen of this Colony, that firmness, and Resolution to make\r\nevery constitutional Stand against the Efforts of a corrupt\r\nadministration which appears in the proceedings of so many Towns\r\nalready publishd to the World, must afford full conviction to the\r\nEarl of Dartmouth that the opposition is not, as was represented\r\nto his predecessor in office, an expiring Faction. That the\r\nPeople of this province thus animated with a laudable Zeal, may\r\nbe directed to the wisest measures for the Defence & Support of\r\ntheir common Liberty is the ardent wish of this Committee.\r\n\r\nWe are with the warmest affection for our Country, and a due\r\nregard to the Town of Hatfield\r\n\r\nSir\r\nyour assured friends\r\n& humble Servants,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Town Clerk of Hatfield.

Those Resolutions\r\nhave been since considerd by the House and with little Variation\r\nadopted as youl see by the inclosd.

Many if not most of the latter voted for all the other\r\nresolves. A Petition & Remonstrance against Hutchinson & Oliver\r\nwill be brot in I suppose this Week.

It is for\r\nthis Reason that former Houses of Representatives have from time\r\nto time prepared a true State of facts to be laid before your\r\nMajesty; but their Petitions it is presumed, have by some means\r\nbeen prevented from reaching your Royal Hand.\r\n\r\nYour Majestys Petitioners have at length had before them certain\r\nPapers, from which, they conceive it2 may be made manifestly to\r\nappear that there has long been a Combination3 of evil Men in\r\nthis province, who have contemplated Measures and formd a Plan,\r\nto raise their own Fortunes and advance themselves to Posts of\r\nPower Honor & Profit, to the Destruction of the Character of the\r\nprovince, at the Expence of the Quiet of the Nation and to the\r\nannihilating of the Rights & Liberties of the American Colonies.\r\n\r\nAnd we do with all due Submission to your Majesty, beg Leave\r\nparticularly to complain of the Conduct of his Excellency Thomas\r\nHutchinson Esqr Governor, and the Honbe Andrew Oliver Esqr\r\nLieutenant Governor of this province, as having a natural &\r\nefficacious Tendency to interrupt & alienate the Affections of\r\nyour Majesty our Rightful Sovereign from this your loyal\r\nprovince; to destroy that Harmony & Good Will between Great\r\nBritain and this Colony which every honest Subject would wish to\r\nestablish; to excite the Resentment of the British Administration\r\nagainst this Province; to defeat the Endeavors of our Agents &\r\nFriends to serve us by a fair Representation of our State of\r\nfacts; and to prevent our humble and repeated Petitions from\r\nreaching the Ear of your Majesty & having their desired Effect.\r\nAnd finally that the said Thos Hutchinson & Andrew Oliver have\r\nbeen some of the chiefe Instruments in the Introduction of a\r\nFleet and Army into this province to establish & perpetuate their\r\nplans; whereby they have not only been greatly instrumental of\r\ndisturbing the peace & Harmony of the Government and causing\r\nunnatural & hateful Discords and Animosities between the several\r\nparts of your Majestys Dominions, but are justly chargeable with\r\nall that Corruption of Morals in this Province, and all that\r\nConfusion Misery and Bloodshed which have been the natural\r\nEffects of the posting of Troops in a populous Town.\r\n\r\nWe do therefore most humbly beseech your Majesty, to give order\r\nthat Time may be allowed to us to support these our complaints by\r\nour Agents and Council. And as the said Thos Hutchinson Esqr and\r\nAndrew Oliver Esqr have by their above mentiond Conduct and\r\notherwise rendered themselves justly obnoxious to your Majestys\r\nloving Subjects, we pray that your Majesty will be graciously\r\npleasd to remove them from their posts in this Government, and\r\nplace such good and faithful men in their Stead as, your Majesty\r\nin your great Wisdom shall think fit----------\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Adopted by the House of Representatives by a vote of 80 to 11,\r\nafter a motion to refer its consideration to the\r\nnext session had been defeated by a vote of 73 to13.\r\n2As an alternative to the following six words, the draft has\r\nalso, interlined, \"is most reasonable to Suppose.\"\r\n3The draft has also \"Conspiracy,\" interlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text with\r\nmodifications is in R.

I then informd you of the passing of a Number of\r\nResolves in the House of Representatives upon certain Letters\r\nthat had been under their Consideration. Since which the House\r\nhave by a Division of 82/12, voted a Petition & Remonstrance to\r\nthe King praying that Govr Hutchinson & Lt Govr Oliver may be\r\nremovd from their Posts. A Copy of which is sent to Dr Franklin\r\nby this Vessel, who is directed to apply to Arthur Lee, Esqr and\r\nany other Gentleman as Council. Upon my motion the Dr was\r\ndirected to make application to you solely; but the next Day it\r\nwas questiond in the House whether you were yet initiated into\r\nthe Practice of Law, and the Addition was made upon a Doubt which\r\nI was sorry I had it not in my Power to remove. However, you must\r\nbe applyd to; Every Friend of Liberty, or which is the same\r\nthing, nine-tenths of the House having the greatest Confidence in\r\nyour Integrity and Abilities.\r\n\r\nYou have herewith inclosd a Copy of the proceedings of the\r\nCouncil upon the same Subject.\r\n\r\nThe People are highly incensd against the two impeachd Gentlemen.\r\nThey have entirely lost the Esteem of the publick. Even some of\r\ntheir few friends are ashamd to countenance them. The Govr, as he\r\nhas been one of the most obligd, has provd himself to be a most\r\nungrateful man. He appears to me to be totally disconcerted. I\r\nwish I could say humbled.\r\n\r\nThe House are now considering the Independency of the Judges; A\r\nMatter which every day grows still more serious, and employs much\r\nof the Attention of the People without Doors, as well as of the\r\nMembers of the House. I wish Lord Dartmouth & the rest of the\r\nGreat officers of the Crown could be prevaild upon duly to\r\nconsider that British Americans cannot long endure a State of\r\nTyranny.\r\n\r\nI expect the Genl Assembly will be up in a few Days.1 I will then\r\nwrite you more particularly. In the mean time I remain\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1The General Court was prorogued June 29, to meet September 15;\r\nbut the next session did not begin until\r\nJanuary 26, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO THE COMMITTEE OF\r\nCORRESPONDENCE OF WOCESTER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Septemr 11, 1773\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nThe happy fruit of the Appointment of Committees of\r\nCorrespondence in almost every Town in this province, is the\r\nAdvantage that Each has of communicating any Matter of common\r\nConcern & Importance to a chosen Number of Men zealous for the\r\npublick Liberty, in any particular Town or County, where it may\r\nbe specially requisite that such Intelligence shd be given. In\r\norder to support our Cause, it is necessary that we attend to\r\nevery part of the plan which our enemies have concerted against\r\nit. In making Laws & raising revenues from us without our\r\nConsent, a Design is evidently apparent to render an American\r\nLegislative of little Weight; and in appropriating such revenues\r\nto the support of Governor & Judges, it as evidently appears that\r\nthere is a fixd Design to make our Executive dependent upon them\r\n& subservient to their own purposes. Every method is therefore to\r\nbe usd that is practicable, in opposition to these two capital\r\nGrievances, which are the fountain from whence every other\r\nGrievance flows. All the Judges of the Superior Court, except the\r\nChiefe Justice have receivd the Grants out of the province\r\nTreasury in full; but this by no means makes it certain whether\r\nthey intend for the future to depend upon the Crown for Support\r\nor upon the Grants of the Genl Assembly. Indeed one of them viz\r\nMr Trowbridge has explicitly declared to the Speaker of the House\r\nof Representatives that he will receive his Salary from the\r\nprovince only, so long as he shall hold his Commission. The\r\nChiefe Justice (Oliver) has been totally silent. So that neither\r\nof them except Mr Trowbridge has yet thought proper to comply\r\nwith the just Expectation & Demand of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, upon which the Safety, & therefore we trust the\r\nQuiet of this people depends.\r\n\r\nThe Court is now sitting here; and the Grand Jury have presented\r\na Memorial to them, setting forth as we are informd, the Contempt\r\nwith which the Grand Juries of the province have been treated in\r\nthe Letters of Govr Hutchinson & others; asserting the\r\nIndependence of Grand Juries as being accountable to none but God\r\n& their own Consciences for their Conduct; claiming to themselves\r\nequal protection with the Court, & expecting that effectual\r\nmeasures will be taken to secure that most valueable Branch of\r\nour civil Constitution, from further Contempt. They have also\r\nrepresented to the Court, the great Uneasiness in the Minds of\r\nthe people of this County & as they conceive of the whole\r\nprovince, by reason of the uncertainty that yet remains,\r\nrespecting the Dependence of the Judges on the Crown for Support,\r\n& their own Doubts & Difficulties on this Account; & they pray\r\nthat the Court wd come to an explicit & publick Declaration\r\nthereupon.\r\n\r\nThis is the Substance of the Matter. We shall endeavor to obtain\r\na correct Copy, & in that Case you will see it publishd in the\r\nnewspapers. In the mean time we would propose to you whether it\r\nwould not be serving the Cause if every County would take similar\r\nMeasures. And as the Court is to sit next in your County,1 &\r\nyours is the principal Town we have written to your Committee\r\nonly on this Subject, leaving it to your Discretion & good\r\nJudgment to take such methods as shall be most proper.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf.

The \"wild\r\nand extravagant Notions\" (as they have been lately called) of the\r\nsupreme Authority of Parliament \"flowing from the Pen of an House\r\nof Representatives\" has greatly chagrind them; as they apprehend\r\nit has been the means of awakning that Spirit of Opposition to\r\ntheir Measures, which from the Information their Tools on this\r\nside of the Water had given them, and the Confidence they had\r\nplaced in the Art and Address of Mr Hutchinson, they had flatterd\r\nthemselves, had subsided, & would soon be extinguished. At the\r\nsame time they are very sensible, that the impartial Part of the\r\nNation, considering that the House were in a Manner forced to\r\nexpress their own Sentiments on the Subject, be they what they\r\nmight, with Freedom are ready to exculpate them, and lay the\r\nwhole Blame, if there be any, upon the Governor, for his\r\nImprudent Zeal in bringing a Matter into open Controversy which\r\nthe Ministry had hoped to have settled in a silent Way. It is my\r\nOpinion that the present Administration even though the very good\r\nLord Darmouth is one of them, are as fixed in their Resolutions\r\nto carry this favorite point as any of their Predecessors have\r\nbeen; I mean to gain from us an implicit Acknowledgment of the\r\nRight of Parliament to make Laws binding upon us in all Cases\r\nwhatever. The King who you know determines by their Advice, has\r\nexpressd his Displeasure at our late petitions because they held\r\nup Rights repugnant to this Right. Some of our Politicians would\r\nhave the People believe that Administration are disposd or\r\ndetermind to have all the Grievances which we complain of\r\nredressd, if we will only be quiet. But this I apprehend would be\r\na fatal Delusion; for I have the best Assurances, that if the\r\nKing himself should make any Concessions or take any Steps\r\ncontrary to the Right of Parliamt to tax us, he would be in\r\nDanger of embroiling himself with the Ministry; and that under\r\nthe present Prejudices of all about him, even the recalling an\r\nInstruction to the Governor is not yet likely to be advisd. Lord\r\nDartmouth has indeed lately said in the House of Lords as I have\r\nit from a Gentleman in London who receivd the Information from a\r\npeer who was present, that \"he had formd his plan of Redress,\r\nwhich he was determind to carry AT THE HAZARD OF HIS OFFICE.\" But\r\nhis Lordship might very safely make this Promise; for from all\r\nthat I have heard, his Plan of Redress is built very much upon\r\nthe Hopes that we may be prevaild upon, at least implicitly to\r\nyield up the Right, of which his Lordship is as fixd in his\r\nOpinion, as any other Minister. This I conceive they have had\r\nin view from the year 1763; and we may well remember, that when\r\nthe Stamp Act was repeald, our Friends in Parliamt submitted as a\r\nCondition of the Repeal, that the declaratory Act as it is called\r\nshould be passed, declaratory of the Right & Authority of\r\nParliament to make Laws binding upon us in all Cases whatever.\r\nTill that time the Dispute had been limitted to the Right of\r\nTaxation. By assuming the Power of making Laws for America IN ALL\r\nCASES, at the time when the Stamp Act was repeald it was probably\r\ntheir Design to secure, as far as they could do it by an Act of\r\ntheir own, this particular Right of Taxation thinking at the same\r\ntime that if they could once establish the Precedent in an\r\nInstance of so much importance to us, as that of taking our Money\r\nfrom us, they should thenceforward find it very easy to exercise\r\ntheir pretended Right in every other Case. For this Purpose in\r\nthe very next Session if I mistake not, they passed another\r\nrevenue Act, for America; which they have been endeavoring to\r\nsupport by military parade, as well as by other Means, at an\r\nExpence to the Nation, as it is said of more than the revenue\r\nyielded. And yet, in order to induce us to acquiesce in or\r\nsilently to submit to their Exercise of this Right, they have\r\neven condescended to meet us half way (as it was artfully given\r\nout) and lessened this Revenue by taking off the Duty on Glass &\r\nseveral other Articles. Mr George Grenville declared that he\r\nwould be satisfied with a PEPER CORN, but that he must have\r\nTHREE; which shows that he had a stronger Sense of the Importance\r\nof establishing the Power of Parliament, or as his own Words\r\nwere, \"of securing the Obedience of the Colonies\" than barely of\r\na Revenue. The Acknowledgment on our part of the Right of\r\nParliament has been their invariable Object: And could they now\r\ngain this Acknowledgment from us, tho it were but implicitly,\r\nthey would willingly sacrifice the PRESENT revenue by a repeal of\r\nthe Acts, and FOR THE PRESENT redress all our Grievances. I have\r\nbeen assured that a Question has of late been privately put by\r\none in Administration upon whom much Dependence is had by some\r\npersons, to a Gentleman well acquainted with the Sentiments of\r\nthe People of this Province, Whether the present House of\r\nRepresentatives could not be prevaild on to rescind the Answers\r\nof the last House to the Governors Speeches relative to the\r\nsupreme Authority of Parliament; which Answers have been lookd\r\nupon as a Bar in the Way of a Reconciliation and being informd\r\nthat such a measure on our part could by no means be expected, I\r\nam apprehensive that Endeavors will be used to draw us into an\r\nincautious mode of Conduct which will be construed as in Effect\r\nreceding from the Claim of Rights of which we have hitherto been\r\njustly so tenacious. It has been given out, I suspect from the\r\nSecrets of the Cabinet, that if we will now send home decent\r\ntemperate & dutiful petitions, even our imaginary Grievances\r\nshall be redressd; but let us consider what Ideas Administration\r\nhave of Decency Temperance & Dutifulness as applyd to this Case.\r\nOur late petitions against the Independency of the Governor &\r\nJudges were deemd indecent intemperate & undutiful, not because\r\nthey were expressd in exceptionable Words, but because it was\r\ntherein said that by the Charter it plainly appeard to us to be\r\nintended by the Royal Grantors that the General Assembly should\r\nbe the constituted Judge of the adequate Support of the\r\nGovernment of the province and the Ways & Means of providing for\r\nthe same; and further that this operation of an Act of\r\nparliament, by which the People are taxed & the money is\r\nappropriated & used for that purpose, derogates from one of the\r\nmost sacred Rights granted in the Charter, & most essential to\r\nthe Freedom of the Constituion, & divests the Genl Assembly of a\r\nmost important part of legislative Power and Authority expressly\r\ngranted therein, and necessary for the Good and Welfare of the\r\nprovince & the Support and Government of the same. The Subject\r\nMatter of our Complaint was, not that a Burden greater than our\r\nproportion was laid upon us by Parliament; such a Complaint we\r\nmight have made salva Authoritate parliamentaria: But that the\r\nParliament had assumed & exercisd the power of taxing us & thus\r\nappropriating our money, when by Charter it was the exclusive\r\nright of the General Assembly. We could not otherwise have\r\nexplaind to his Majesty the Grievance which we meant to complain\r\nof; and yet he is pleasd in his answer to declare that he has\r\nwell weighd the Subject Matter of the petitions--and is\r\ndetermined to support the Constitution and to resist with\r\nfirmness every Attempt to derogate from the Authority of the\r\nsupreme Legislature. Does not this imply that the parliament is\r\nthe supreme Legislature & its Authority over the Colonies of the\r\nConstitution? And that until we frame our petitions so as that it\r\nmay fairly be construed that we have at least tacitly conceded to\r\nit we may expect they will be still disregarded or frownd upon as\r\nbeing not decent temperate and dutifull? We may even be allowd to\r\nclaim certain Rights and exercise subordinate powers of\r\nLegislation like the Corporations in England, subject to the\r\nuniversal Controul of Parliamt, and if we will implicitly\r\nacknowledge its Right to make Laws binding upon us in all Cases\r\nwhatever, that is, its absolute Sovereignty over us the Acts we\r\nshall them complain of as burdensome to us, shall be repeald, all\r\nGrievances redressd, and Administration will flatter us that the\r\nright shall never be exercisd but in a Case of absolute necessity\r\nwhich shall be apparent to every judicious man in the Empire. To\r\ninduce us to be thus submissive beyond the bounds of reason &\r\nSafety their Lordships will condescend to be familiar with us and\r\ntreat us with Cakes & Sugar plumbs. But who is to determine when\r\nthe necessity shall be thus apparent? Doubtless the Parliamt,\r\nwhich is supposd to be the supreme Legislature will claim that\r\nprerogative; and then they will for ever make Laws for us when\r\nthey think proper. Or if the several Colony Assemblies are to\r\nsignify that such necessity is apparent to every wise man within\r\ntheir respective Jurisdictions before the parliamt shall exercise\r\nthe Right, the point will be given up to us in Effect, that the\r\nParliamt shall not make a Law binding upon us in any Case until\r\nwe shall consent to it, which their Lordships can in no wise be\r\nthought to intend.\r\n\r\nBut I must break off this abruptly. I intend to write you\r\nfurther. In the meantime I must beg to be indulgd with your Thots\r\non these matters & remain with great regard,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1The political leader of Northhampton, Massachusetts. His \"Broken\r\nHints\" is in Niles, Principles and Acts, p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH HAWLEY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Octob 13 1773\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI lately wrote you a long Epistle upon our political Affairs; and\r\nalthough I fear I have put your patience on the Tryal, I can not\r\nwithstand a strong Inclination to communicate more of my mind to\r\nyou on the same Subject. Perhaps it may be of Service to you, as\r\nit may afford you an opportunity of exercising that Charity or\r\nCandor which \"beareth all things.\"\r\n\r\nI have taken some pains to enquire into the true Character of the\r\nMinister in the American Department. And I find that all allow\r\nhim to be a good man. Goodness has rarely I fear been of late the\r\nChracteristick of his Majestys Ministers; for which reason his\r\nLordship is to be sure the more highly to be prizd. But it seems\r\nvery necessary that Men in such elevated Stations should be great\r\nas well as good. The Promotion of a nobleman to this Department,\r\nwho is famed in America for his Piety is easily accounted for on\r\nthe principles of modern Policy. However illy we may deserve it,\r\nthe great men in England have an opinion of us as being a\r\nmightily religious People. Surely than it must be supposd that we\r\nshall place an entire Confidence in a Minister of the same\r\nCharacter. We find it so in fact. How many were filled with the\r\nmost sanguine Expectations, when they heard that the good Lord\r\nDartmouth was entrusted with a Share in Administration? Little\r\ndid they think that if his Lordship did not come in upon express\r\nterms, which however is doubted by some, yet without a Greatness\r\nof mind equal, perhaps superior to his Goodness, it will be\r\nimpossible for him singly to stem the Torrent of Corruption. This\r\nrequires much more Fortitude than I yet believe he is possesd of.\r\nFain would I have him treated with great Decency & Respect, both\r\nfor the Station he is in and the Character he sustains; but\r\nconsidering with whom he is connected, I confess that in regard\r\nto any power he will have substantially to serve us, I am an\r\nInfidel.\r\n\r\nI do not agree with some of our Politicians who tell us that the\r\nMinistry are \"sick of their Measures.\" I cannot but wonder that\r\nany prudent Man should believe this, while he sees not the least\r\nRelaxation of measures; but instead of it new Insult & Abuse. Is\r\nthe Act of Parliament, made the last year, and the Appointment of\r\nCommissioners with Instructions to put it in full Execution in\r\nthe Rhode Island Affair, a Ground of such a Beliefe? Can we think\r\nthe East India Company are so satisfied that Administration are\r\ndisposd to give up their Designs of establishing Arbitrary Power,\r\nwhen no longer ago than the last Session of Parliament they\r\neffected the Deprivation of their Charter Rights, whereby they\r\nhave acquired so great an Addition of Power & Influence to the\r\nCrown? Or are such Hopes to be gatherd from the Treatment given\r\nto our own Petitions the last May, when they were discountenancd\r\nfor no other Reason but because the Rights of our Charter were\r\ntherein pleaded as a Reason against a measure which if a little\r\nwhile persisted in, will infallibly establish a Despotism in the\r\nEnd? Surely this is not a time for us to testify the least\r\nConfidence in the Spirit of the British Government, or from\r\nflattering Hopes that their designs are to alter measures, to\r\ntrust to their Discretion or good Will.\r\n\r\nI am apt to think that Ministry have two great Events in\r\nContemplation both which in all probability will take place\r\nshortly. The one is a War & the other a new Election of\r\nParliament Men. In order to improve these Events to their own\r\npurpose, it will become necessary to sooth & flatter the\r\nAmericans with Hopes of Reliefe. In Case of a War, America if in\r\ngood Humour will be no contemptible Ally. She will be able by her\r\nExertions to annoy the Enemy much. Her aid will therefore be\r\ncourted. And to bring her into this good Humour, the Ministry\r\nmust be lavish in promises of great things to be done for her.\r\nPerhaps some Concessions will be made; but these Concessions will\r\nflow from policy not from Justice. Should they recall their\r\nTroops from the Castle, or do twenty other seemingly kind things,\r\nwe ought never to think their Designs are benevolent toward us,\r\nwhile they continue to exercise the pretended Right to tax us at\r\ntheir pleasure, and appropriate our money to their own purposes.\r\nAnd this they have certainly no Thought at present of yielding\r\nup. With regard to the Election of another House of Commons, that\r\nwill not take place within these Eighteen months unless a\r\nDissolution of parliamt should happen before; which has indeed\r\nbeen hinted, & may be the movement in order suddenly to bring on\r\nthe Election before the People are prepared for it. We are to\r\nsuppose that an Attempt will be made to purchase the Votes of the\r\nwhole Kingdom. This will require much Time and dexterous\r\nManagement. The Ministry have in a great Measure lost the\r\nInfluence of London and other great Corporations as well as that\r\nof the East India Company by their late Treatment of that\r\npowerful Body, whom Lord North now finds it necessary to coax and\r\npascify. They will therefore be glad to sooth America into a\r\nState of Quietness, if they can do it without conceding to our\r\nRights, that they may have the Aid of the Friends of America when\r\nthe new Election comes on. And that America has many Friends\r\namong the Merchants & Manufacturers the Country Gentlemen &\r\nespecially the Dissenters from the establishd Church I am so well\r\ninformd that I cannot doubt. The last of these are so from\r\ngenerous the others from private & selfish Principles. Such\r\nConsiderations as these will be strong Inducements [to] them to\r\nmake us fair & flattering Promises for the present; but Nothing I\r\nthink will be so dangerous as for the Americans to withdraw their\r\nDependence upon themselves & place it upon those whose constant\r\nEndeavor for ten years past has been to enslave us, & who, if\r\nthey can obtain a new Election of old Members, it is to be feard,\r\nunless we keep up a perpetual Watchfulness, will, in another\r\nseven years, effect their Designs. The Safety of the Americans in\r\nmy humble opinion depends upon their pursuing their wise Plan of\r\nUnion in Principle & Conduct. If we persevere in asserting our\r\nRights, the Time must come probably a Time of War, when our just\r\nClaims must be attended to & our Complaints regarded. But if we\r\ndiscoverd the least Disposition to submit our Claims to their\r\nDecision, it is my opinion that our Injuries will be increasd\r\nthen fold. I conclude at present with assuring you that I am with\r\nsincere regard\r\n\r\nSir your Friend & hbl servt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF MASSACHUSETTS TO OTHER\r\nCOMMITTEES OF CORRESPONDENCE.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPRO OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY\r\n\r\nBOSTON Octob 21 1773\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Correspondence appointed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives of this Province have been not altogether\r\ninattentive to the Design of their Institution. We have been\r\nwaiting for Intelligence from Great Britain from whose\r\ninjudicious Councils the common Grievances of the Colonies have\r\nsprang; in hopes that a Change in the American Department would\r\nhave producd a happy Change in the measures of Administration;\r\nBut we are sorry to say, that from the best Accounts that we have\r\nobtaind the Ministry have been hitherto so far from radically\r\nredressing American Grievances that even the least Relaxation has\r\nnot been advisd if thought of. On the Contrary, the British\r\nParliament have been prorogud without taking the least Notice of\r\nthe Affairs of America; while they have been curtailing the\r\nCharter of the East India Company in such a Manner & in such a\r\nDegree, as to indicate that they are much more intent upon\r\nincreasing the power & Influence of the Crown than securing\r\nLiberties of the Subject. At the same time, this Province has had\r\na very recent Discovery of the unalterd Resolution of the\r\nMinistry to pursue their plan of arbitrary Power, in the Kings\r\nAnswer to the Petitions of our Assembly against the appropriation\r\nof the Revenue raisd from the Colonies, for the purpose of\r\nrendering our Governor & Judges dependent on the Crown. In his\r\nMajestys Answer, we have nothing explicit, but his Resolution to\r\nsupport the supreme Authority of the British parliamt to make\r\nLaws binding on the Colonies (altho the petitions were supported\r\nby the express Declarations of the Charter of the province) and\r\nhis great Displeasure, that principles repugnant to that Right\r\nwere therein held forth. Such an Answer to such a petition\r\naffords the strongest Grounds to conclude, that the Ministry are\r\nas firmly resolvd as ever to continue the Revenue Acts & apply\r\nthe tribute extorted by Virtue of them from the Colonies, to\r\nmaintain the executive powers of the several Governments of\r\nAmerica absolutely independent of their respective Legislatures;\r\nor rather absolutely dependent on the Crown, which will, if a\r\nlittle while persisted in, end in absolute Despotism.\r\n\r\nSuch being still the temper of the British Ministry, Such the\r\nDisposition of the parliament of Britain under their Direction &\r\nInfluence, to consider themselves as THE SOVEREIGN of America, Is\r\nit not of the utmost Importance that our Vigilance should\r\nincrease, that the Colonies should be united in their Sentiments\r\nof the Measures of Oppposition necessary to be taken by them, and\r\nthat in whichsoever of the Colonies any Infringments are or shall\r\nbe made on the common Rights of all, that Colony should have the\r\nunited Efforts of all for its Support. This we take to be the\r\ntrue Design of the Establishment of our Committees of\r\nCorrespondence.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which appears to us to be an Object worthy of\r\nthe immediate Attention of the Colonies. Should a War take place,\r\nwhich is thought by many to be near at hand, America will then be\r\nviewd by Administration in a Light of Importance to Great\r\nBritain. Her Aids will be deemd necessary; her Friendship\r\ntherefore will perhaps be even courted. Would it not then be the\r\nhighest Wisdom in the several American Assemblies, absolutely to\r\nwithhold all kinds of Aid in a general War, untill the Rights &\r\nLiberties which THEY OUGHT TO ENJOY are restored, & secured to\r\nthem upon the most permanent foundation? This has always been the\r\nUsage of a spirited House of Commons in Britain, and upon the\r\nbest Grounds; for certainly protection & Security ought to be the\r\nunalterable Condition when Supplys are called for. With Regard to\r\nthe Extent of Rights which the Colonies ought to insist upon, it\r\nis a Subject which requires the closest Attention & Deliberation;\r\nand this is a strong Reason why it should claim the earliest\r\nConsideration of, at least, every Committee; in order that we may\r\nbe prepared when time & Circumstances shall give to our Claim the\r\nsurest prospect of Success. And when we consider how one great\r\nEvent has hurried on, upon the back of another, such a time may\r\ncome & such Circumstances take place sooner than we are now aware\r\nof. There are certain Rights which every Colony has explicitly\r\nasserted, & we trust they will never give up. THAT in particular,\r\nthat they have the sole & unalienable Right to give & grant their\r\nown money & appropriate it to such purposes as they judge proper,\r\nis justly deemd to be of the last Importance. But whether even\r\nthis Right, so essential to our Freedom & Happiness, can remain .\r\n. . to us, while a Right is claimed by the British parliament to\r\nmake Laws binding upon us in all Cases whatever, you will\r\ncertainly consider with Seriousness. It would be debasing to us\r\nafter so manly a Struggle for our Rights to be contented with a\r\nmere TEMPORARY reliefe. We take the Liberty to present you with\r\nthe State of a Controversy upon that Subject, between the\r\nGovernor of this province and the Assembly. And as the Assembly\r\nof this or some other Colony may possibly be called into further\r\nConsideration of it, we should think our selves happy in a\r\nCommunication of such further Thoughts upon it, as we are\r\nperswaded will upon a . . . occur to your Minds. We are far from\r\ndesiring that the Connection between Britain & America should be\r\nbroken. ESTO PERPETUA, is our ardent wish; but upon the Terms\r\nonly of Equal Liberty. If we cannot establish an Agreement upon\r\nthese terms, let us leave it to another & wiser Generation. But\r\nit may be worth Consideration that the work is more likely to be\r\nwell done, at a time when the Ideas of Liberty & its Importance\r\nare strong in Mens Minds. There is Danger that these Ideas will\r\nhereafter grow faint & languid. Our Posterity may be accustomd to\r\nbear the Yoke & being inured to Servility they may even bow the\r\nShoulder to the Burden. It can never be expected that a people,\r\nhowever NUMEROUS, will form & execute a wise plan to perpetuate\r\ntheir Liberty, when they have lost the Spirit & feeling of it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot close without mentioning a fresh Instance of the temper\r\n& Design of the British Ministry; and that is in allowing the\r\nEast India Company, with a View of pacifying them, to ship their\r\nTeas to America. It is easy to see how aptly this Scheme will\r\nserve both to destroy the Trade of the Colonies & increase the\r\nrevenue. How necessary then is it that Each Colony should take\r\neffectual methods to prevent this measure from having its\r\ndesignd Effects.2\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Letter was unanimously agreed to by the Committee\r\nof Correspondence, and is in their name and by their order\r\nTransmitted to you by your most respectfull friends and humble\r\nServants,\r\n\r\nT: CUSHING\r\nS: ADAMS\r\nW: HEATH\r\n\r\nP.S. It is the request of the Committee that the Contents of this\r\nLetter be not made publick least our Common Enemies should\r\ncounteract and prevent its design.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1The origin of this letter appears in the manuscript journal,\r\npreserved in the Boston Public Library, of the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence, consisting of fifteen members, appointed by the\r\nHouse of Representatives of Massachusetts. At a meeting of the\r\ncommittee on June 28, 1773, a sub-committee, consisting of Adams,\r\nHancock, Cushing, Phillips, and Heath, was appointed, to write to\r\nthe Connecticut Committee of Correspondence and also to the\r\ncommittee of each assembly. The letter to Connecticut appears to\r\nhave been approved at a meeting of the sub-committee on July 4.\r\nAt a meeting of the sub-committee on July 15 Adams was asked to\r\ndraft a letter on general government to the committees of the\r\nneighboring governments. This letter was still unwritten on\r\nAugust 19, and on September 29 the sub-committee called a meeting\r\nof the full committee for October 20. On that date it was voted\r\nexpedient to write a circular letter to the other committees, and\r\nin the afternoon of the same day Adams and Warren were appointed\r\na sub-committee to draft such a letter. At the afternoon meeting\r\non October 21 a draft was reported, read several times, and\r\naccepted; and it was voted that the chairman, with Adams and\r\nHeath, should sign the letters. The Journal is printed in\r\nProceedings of Massachusetts Historical Society, 2d ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 85-90.\r\n2The remainder is not in the autograph of Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON, NOVEMBER 5, 1773.\r\n\r\n[Boston Record Commissioner's Report, vol. xviii., pp. 142, 143;\r\na draft of the preamble, in the handwriting of Adams, is in the\r\nMellen Chamberlain collection, Boston Public Library.]\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears by an Act of the British Parliament passed in\r\nthe last Sessions, that the East India Company are by the said\r\nAct allowed to export their Teas into America, in such Quantities\r\nas the Lord of the Treasury shall Judge proper1: And some People\r\nwith an evil intent to amuse the People, and others thro'\r\ninattention to the true design of the Act, have so contrued the\r\nsame, as that the Tribute of three Pence on every Pound of Tea is\r\nnot to be enacted by the detestable Task Masters there2---Upon\r\nthe due consideration thereof, RESOLVED, That the Sense of the\r\nTown cannot be better expressed on this Occasion, than in the\r\nwords of certain Judicious Resolves lately entered into by our\r\nworthy Brethren the Citizens of Philadelphia---wherefore\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, that the disposal of their own property is the Inherent\r\nRight of Freemen; that there can be no property in that which\r\nanother can of right take from us without our consent; that the\r\nClaim of Parliament to tax America, is in other words a claim of\r\nRight to buy3 Contributions on us at pleasure-----\r\n\r\n2d. That the Duty imposed by Parliament upon Tea landed in\r\nAmerica, is a tax on the Americans, or levying Contributions on\r\nthem without their consent-----\r\n\r\n3d. That the express purpose for which the Tax is levied on the\r\nAmericans, namely for the support of Government, the\r\nAdministration of Justice, and the defence of His Majestys\r\nDominions in America, has a direct tendency to render Assemblies\r\nuseless, and to introduce Arbitrary Government and Slavery-----\r\n\r\n4th. That a virtuous and steady opposition to the Ministerial\r\nPlan of governing America, is absolutely necessary to preserve\r\neven the shadow of Liberty, and is a duty which every Freeman in\r\nAmerica owes to his Country to himself and to his Posterity-----\r\n\r\n5th. That the Resolutions lately come by the East India Company,\r\nto send out their Teas to America Subject to the payment of\r\nDuties on its being landed here, is an open attempt to enforce\r\nthe Ministerial Plan, and a violent attack upon the Liberties of\r\nAmerica-----\r\n\r\n6th. That is is the Duty of every American to oppose this\r\nattempt-----\r\n\r\n7th. That whoever shall directly or indirectly countenance this\r\nattempt, or in any wise aid or abet in unloading receiving or\r\nvending the Tea sent or to be sent out by the East India Company\r\nwhile it remains subject to the payment of a duty here is an\r\nEnemy to America-----\r\n\r\n8th. That a Committee be immediately chosen to wait on those\r\nGentlemen, who it is reported are appointed by the East India\r\nCompany to receive and sell said Tea, and to request them from a\r\nregard to their own characters and the peace and good order of\r\nthis Town and Province immediately to resign their appointment.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1At this point the draft includes the words, \"without the same\r\nhaving been exposed to sale in the Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain.\"\r\n2The draft reads \"here.\"\r\n3The town record should apparently read \"lay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO THE COMMITTEE OF\r\nCORRESPONDENCE OF ROXBURY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Novr 9, 1773.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nThe Town of Boston has for a few days past been greatly alarmd\r\nwith hearing of the marching of the Soldiers posted at Castle\r\nIsland from day to day in Companies through the neighboring Towns\r\narmd.

Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp 212, 213.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Dec. 25th, 1773.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,---I wrote you a few days past by Capt. Scott, and\r\nthen promised to write farther by the next opportunity; but not\r\nhaving heard of the sailing of this vessel till this moment, I\r\nhave only time to recommend a letter written and directed to you\r\nby John Scollay, Esq. a worthy gentleman and one of the selectmen\r\nof this town. He desires me to apologise for his addressing a\r\nletter to one who is a perfect stranger to him, and to assure you\r\nthat he is persuaded there is no gentleman in London who has the\r\nliberties of Amercia more warmly at heart, or is more able to\r\nvindicate them than yourself. You see the dependence we have upon\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nExcuse this SHORT EPISTLE, and be assured that as I am a friend\r\nto every one possessed of public virtue, with affection I must be\r\nconstantly yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp 209-212.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Dec. 31, 1773.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,---I am now to inform you of as remarkable an event\r\nas had yet happened since the commencement of our struggle for\r\nAmerican liberty. The meeting of the town of Boston, an account\r\nof which I enclosed in my last, was succeeded by the arrival of\r\nthe ship Falmouth, Captain Hall, with 114 chests of the East\r\nIndia Company's tea, on the 28th of November last. The next day\r\nthe people met in Faneuil hall, without observing the rules\r\nprescribed by law for calling them together; and although that\r\nhall is capable of holding 1200 or 1300 men, they were soon\r\nobliged for the want of room to adjourn to the Old South meeting-\r\nhouse; where were assembled upon this important occasion 5000,\r\nsome say 6000 men, consisting of the respectable inhabitants of\r\nthis and the adjacent towns. The business of the meeting was\r\nconducted with decency, unanimity, and spirit. Their resolutions\r\nyou will observe in an enclosed printed paper. It naturally fell\r\nupon the correspondence for the town of Boston to see that these\r\nresolutions were carried into effect. This committee, finding\r\nthat the owner of the ship after she was unloaded of all her\r\ncargo except the tea, was by no means disposed to take the\r\nnecessary steps for her sailing back to London, thought it best\r\nto call in the committees of Charlestown, Cambridge, Brookline,\r\nRoxbury, and Dorchester, all of which towns are in the\r\nneighborhood of this, for their advice and assistance. After a\r\nfree conference and due consideration, they dispersed. The next\r\nday, being the 14th, inst. the people met again at the Old South\r\nchurch, and having ascertained the owner, they COMPELLED him to\r\napply at the custom house for a clearance for his ship to London\r\nwith the tea on board, and appointed ten gentlemen to see it\r\nperformed; after which they adjourned till Thursday the 16th. The\r\npeople then met, and Mr. Rotch informed them that he had\r\naccording to their injunction applied to the collector of the\r\ncustoms for a clearance, and received in answer from the\r\ncollector that he could not consistently with his duty grant him\r\na clearance, until the ship should be discharged of the dutiable\r\narticle on board. It must be here observed that Mr. Rotch had\r\nbefore made a tender of the tea to the consignees, being told by\r\nthem that it was not practicable for them at that time to receive\r\nthe tea, by reason of a constant guard kept upon it by armed men;\r\nbut that when it might be practicable, they would receive it. He\r\ndemanded the captain's bill of lading and the freight, both which\r\nthey refused him, against which he entered a regular protest. The\r\npeople then required Mr. Rotch to protest the refusal of the\r\ncollector to grant him a clearance under these circumstances, and\r\nthereupon to wait upon the governor for a permit to pass the\r\ncastle in her voyage to London, and then adjourned till the\r\nafternoon. They then met, and after waiting till sun-setting, Mr.\r\nRotch returned, and acquainted them that the governor had refused\r\nto grant him a passport, thinking it inconsistent with the laws\r\nand his duty to the king, to do it until the ship should be\r\nqualified, notwithstanding Mr. Rotch had acquainted him with the\r\ncircumstances above mentioned. You will observe by the printed\r\nproceedings, that the people were resolved that the tea should\r\nnot be landed, but sent back to London in the same bottom; and\r\nthe property should be safe guarded while in port, which they\r\npunctually performed. It cannot therefore be fairly said that the\r\ndestruction of the property was in their contemplation. It is\r\nproved that the consignees, together with the collector of the\r\ncustoms, and the governor of the province, prevented the safe\r\nreturn of the East India Company's property (the danger of the\r\nsea only excepted) to London. The people finding all their\r\nendeavours for this purpose thus totally frustrated, dissolved\r\nthe meeting, which had consisted by common estimation of at least\r\nseven thousand men, many of whom had come from towns at the\r\ndistance of twenty miles. In less than four hours every chest of\r\ntea on board three ships which had by this time arrived, THREE\r\nHUNDRED AND FORTY-TWO chests, or rather the contents of them, was\r\nthrown into the sea, without the least injury to the vessels or\r\nany other property. The only remaining vessel which was expected\r\nwith this detested article, is by the act of righteous heaven\r\ncast on shore on the back of Cape Cod, which has often been the\r\nsad fate of many a more valuable cargo. For a more particular\r\ndetail of facts, I refer you to our worthy friend, Dr. Hugh\r\nWilliamson, who kindly takes the charge of this letter. We have\r\nhad great pleasure in his company for a few weeks past; and he\r\nfavoured the meeting with his presence.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine the height of joy that sparkles in the eyes\r\nand animates the countenances as well as the hearts of all we\r\nmeet on this occasion; excepting the disappointed, disconcerted\r\nHutchinson and his tools. I repeat what I wrote you in my last;\r\nif lord Dartmouth has prepared his plan let him produce it\r\nspeedily; but his lordship must know that it must be such a plan\r\nas will not barely amuse, much less farther irritate but\r\nconciliate the affection of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI had forgot to tell you that before the arrival of either of\r\nthese ships, the tea commissioners had preferred a petition to\r\nthe governor and council, praying \"to resign themselves and the\r\nproperty in their care, to his excellency and the board as\r\nguardians and protectors of the people, and that measures may be\r\ndirected for the landing and securing the tea,\" &c. I have\r\nenclosed you the result of the council on that petition. He (the\r\ngovernor) is now, I am told, consulting HIS lawyers and books to\r\nmake out that the resolves of the meeting are treasonable. I duly\r\nreceived your favours of the 23d June, of the 21st July and 13th\r\nOctober,1 and shall make the best use I can of the important\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to be affectionately your friend,\r\n\r\nP. S.---Your letter of the 28th August is but this moment come to\r\nhand. I hope to have leisure to write you by the next vessel. Our\r\nfriend Dr. Warren has written to you by this2; you will find him\r\nan agreeable and useful correspondent.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Under date of October 13, 1773, Lee had written Adams: \"Every\r\nday gives us new light and new strength.

The People of Boston and the other adjacent Towns\r\nendeavored to have the Tea sent back to the place from whence it\r\ncame & then to prevent the Design from taking Effect. Had this\r\nbeen done in Boston, as it was done in New York & Philadelphia,\r\nthe Design of the Ministry would have been as effectually\r\nprevented here as in those Colonies and the property would have\r\nbeen saved. Governor Hutchinson & the other Crown officers having\r\nthe Command of the Castle by which the Ships must have passed, &\r\nother powers in their Hands, made use of these Powers to defeat\r\nthe Intentions of the people & succeeded; in short the Governor\r\nwho for Art & Cunning as well as an inveterate hatred of the\r\npeople was inferior to no one of the Cabal; both encouragd &\r\nprovoked the people to destroy the Tea. By refusing to grant a\r\nPassport he held up to them the alternative of destroying the\r\nproperty of the East India Company or suffering that to be the\r\nsure means of unhinging the Security of property in general in\r\nAmerica, and by delaying to call on the naval power to protect\r\nthe Tea, he led them to determine their Choice of Difficulties.\r\nIn this View of the Matter the Question is easily decided who\r\nought in Justice to pay for the Tea if it ought to be paid for at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe Destruction of the Tea is the pretence for the unprecedented\r\nSeverity shown to the Town of Boston but the real Cause is the\r\nopposition to Tyranny for which the people of that Town have\r\nalways made themselves remarkeable & for which I think this\r\nCountry is much obligd to them. They are suffering the Vengeance\r\nof Administration in the Common Cause of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\nMARCH 1,1774.1\r\n\r\n[Journal of the House of Representatives, 1773, 1774 p. 219.]\r\n\r\nWhereas Peter Oliver,2 Esq; Chief Justice of the Superior Court\r\nof Judicature, &c. hath declined any more to receive the Grants\r\nof this House for his Services, and hath informed this House by a\r\nWriting under his Hand, that he hath taken and received a Grant\r\nfrom his Majesty for his Services, from the fifth Day of July\r\n1772, to the fifth day of January 1774; and that he is resolved\r\nfor the future to receive the Grants from his Majesty that are or\r\nshall be made for his said Services, while he shall continue in\r\nthis Province as Chief Justice:\r\n\r\nTherefore, RESOLVED, That this House will not proceed to make a\r\nGrant to the said Peter Oliver, Esq; for his Services for the\r\nYear past.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\n1On March 1, 1774, the House of Representatives voted that Adams\r\nshould prepare a resolution stating the reason for omitting the\r\nusual grant to Peter Oliver.

When we consider the Importance\r\nof a Post, by which not only private Letters of Friendship and\r\nCommerce but PUBLICK INTELLIGENCE is conveyd from Colony to\r\nColony, it seems at once proper & necessary that such an one\r\nshould be establishd as shall be under the Direction of the\r\nColonies; more especially when we further consider that the\r\nBritish Administration & their Agents have taken every Step in\r\ntheir Power to prevent an Union of the Colonies which is so\r\nnecessary for our making a successful opposition to their\r\narbitrary Designs, and which depends upon a free Communication of\r\nthe Circumstances and Sentiments of each to the others, and their\r\nmutual Councils Besides, the present Post Office is founded on an\r\nAct of the British Parliament and raises a revenue from us\r\nwithout our Consent, in which View it is equally as obnoxious as\r\nany other revenue Act, and in the time of the Stamp Act as well\r\nas since it has been pleaded as a Precedent against us. And\r\nthough we have appeard to acquiesce in it, because the office was\r\nthought to be of publick Utility, yet, if it is now made use of\r\nfor the purpose of stopping the Channels of publick Intelligence\r\nand so in Effect of aiding the measures of Tyranny, as Mr Goddard\r\ninforms us it is, the necessity of substituting another office in\r\nits Stead must be obvious. The Practicability of doing this\r\nthroughout the Continent is to be considerd. We by no means\r\ndespair of it. But as it depends upon joynt Wisdom & Firmness our\r\nBrethren of New York are sollicitous to know the Sentiments of\r\nthe New England Colonies. It is therefore our earnest Request\r\nthat you would take this matter so interresting to America into\r\nyour consideration, & favor us by the return of Mr Goddard with\r\nyour own Sentiments, and as far as you shall be able to collect\r\nthem, the Sentiments of the Gentlemen of your Town & more\r\nparticularly the Merchants and Traders. And we further request\r\nthat you would, if you shall judge it proper, communicate your\r\nSentiments in a Letter by Mr Goddard to the Committees of\r\nCorrespondence of New York & Philadelphia &c. It is our present\r\nopinion that when a plan is laid for the effectual Establishment\r\nand Regulation of a Post throughout the Colonies upon a\r\nconstitutional Footing, the Inhabitants of this Town will\r\nheartily joyn in carrying it into Execution. We refer you for\r\nfurther particulars to Mr Goddard, who seems to be deeply engagd\r\nin this attempt, not only with a View of serving himself as a\r\nPrinter, but equally from the more generous motive of serving the\r\nCommon Cause of America. We wish Success to the Design and are\r\nwith cordial Esteem,\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\nYour Friends & fellow Countrymen,\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\n1Intended also for the Committees of Correspondence at Salem,\r\nPortsmouth and Newbury Port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 36-39.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, March 25, 1774.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWhile the general court was sitting I received a letter from you\r\nrelating to the unhappy circumstances the town of Marblehead was\r\nthen in; but a great variety of business, some of which was very\r\nimportant, prevented my giving you a convincing proof at that\r\ntime, of the regard with which I am ever disposed to treat your\r\nfavours. Besides, if it had been in my power to have aided you\r\nwith advice, I flattered myself, from the information I\r\nafterwards had, that the storm, though it raged with so much\r\nviolence, would soon spend itself, and a calm would ensue. The\r\ntumult of the people is very properly compared to the raging of\r\nthe sea. When the passions of a multitude become headstrong, they\r\ngenerally will have their course: a direct opposition only tends\r\nto increase them; and as to reasoning, one may as well expect\r\nthat the foaming billows will hearken to a lecture of morality\r\nand be quiet. The skilful pilot will carefully keep the helm, and\r\nso steer the ship while the storm continues, as to prevent, if\r\npossible, her receiving injury.\r\n\r\nWhen your petition was read in the house, I was fearful that our\r\nenemies would make an ill improvement of it. I thought I could\r\ndiscover in the countenances of some a kind of triumph in finding\r\nthat the friends of liberty themselves, were obliged to have\r\nrecourse even to military aid, to protect them from the fury of\r\nan ungoverned mob. They seemed to me to be disposed to confound\r\nthe distinction, between a lawless attack upon property in a case\r\nwhere if there had been right there was remedy, and the people's\r\nrising in the necessary defence of their liberties, and\r\ndeliberately, and I may add rationally destroying property, after\r\ntrying every method to preserve it, and when the men in power had\r\nrendered the destruction of that property the only means of\r\nsecuring the property of ALL.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that such improvement may have been made of the\r\ndisorders in Marblehead, to prejudice or discredit our manly\r\nopposition to the efforts of tyranny; but I hope the friends of\r\nliberty will prevent any injury thereby to the common cause: and\r\nyet, I cannot but express some fears, that parties and\r\nanimosities have arisen among the brethren; because I have just\r\nnow heard from a gentleman of your town, that your committee of\r\ncorrespondence have resolved no more to act! I am loath to\r\nbelieve, nay, I cannot yet believe, that the gentlemen of\r\nMarblehead, who have borne so early and so noble a testimony to\r\nthe cause of American freedom, will desert that cause, only from\r\na difference of sentiments among themselves concerning a matter\r\nwhich has no relation to it. If my fears are groundless, pray be\r\nso kind as to relieve them, by writing to me as soon as you have\r\nan opportunity. I shall take it as the greatest act of friendship\r\nyou can do me. Indeed the matter will soon be put to the trial;\r\nfor our committee, without the least jealousy, have written a\r\nletter to your's, by Mr. Goddard, who is the bearer of this. The\r\ncontents we think of great importance, and therefore I hope they\r\nwill have the serious consideration of the gentlemen of your\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nI am, with strict truth,\r\nYour's affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF MASSACHUSETTS TO BENJAMIN\r\nFRANKLIN.1\r\n\r\n[Seventy-Six Society Publications. Papers Relating to\r\nMassachusetts, pp. 186-192. A draft is in the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence Papers, Lenox Library. A manuscript text, with\r\nautograph signatures, is in the library of the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, March 31st, 1774.\r\n\r\nSIR:\r\n\r\nBy the inclosed Papers you will observe the proceedings of the\r\ntwo Houses of Assembly in the late session with regard to the\r\nJustices of the Superior Court. The conduct of Administration in\r\nadvising an annual Grant of the Crown to the Governor and the\r\nJudges whereby they are rendered absolutely dependent on the\r\nCrown for their being and support, had justly and very\r\nthouroughly alarmed the apprehensions of the people. They clearly\r\nsaw that this measure would complete the Tragedy of American\r\nFreedom, for they could conceive of no state of slavery more\r\nperfect, than for a Parliament in which they could have no voice\r\nto claim a power of making Laws to bind them in all cases\r\nwhatever, and to exercise that assumed Power in taking their\r\nmoney from them and appropriating it for the support of Judges\r\nwho are to execute such laws as that parliament should see fit to\r\nmake binding upon them, and a Fleet and Army to enforce their\r\nsubjection to them. No discerning Minister could expect that a\r\npeople who had not entirely lost the Spirit and Feeling of that\r\nLiberty wherewith they had before been made free, would tamely\r\nand without a struggle submit to be thus disgraced and enslaved\r\nby the most powerful and haughty Nation on Earth. They heard with\r\nastonishment that his Majesty, THEIR OWN SOVEREIGN as well as the\r\nsovereign of Britain, had been advised by his servants to signify\r\nhis displeasure at the decent temperate and humble Petitions of\r\ntheir Representatives, for the redress of this intolerable\r\nGrievance merely because they held up principles founded in\r\nnature, and confirmed to British Subjects by the British\r\nConstitution, and to the subjects in this Province by a sacred\r\ncharter granted to the inhabitants by his illustrious\r\npredecessors for themselves their Heirs and successors forever.\r\nThey regretted that the Influence of the good Lord Dartmouth upon\r\nwhose exertions they had placed a confidence could not prevail to\r\ngain the Royal attention to their just Complaints being assured\r\nthat could his Majesty be truly informed, that the express\r\nintention of the Royal Charter was to establish and confirm to\r\nhis subjects in this Province all the liberties of his natural\r\nborn subjects within the Realm, to all Intents, Purposes and\r\nConstructions whatsoever, they should soon rejoice in the full\r\nredress of their Grievances and that he would revoke his Grants\r\nto his Governor and Judges and leave the Assembly to support his\r\nGovernor in the Province in the way and manner prescribed in the\r\nCharter according to ancient and uninterrupted usage and\r\nconformable to the true spirit of the British Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe People however forbore to take any extraordinary Measures for\r\nthe Removal of this dangerous innovation, and trusted to the\r\nPrudence and fortitude of their Representatives by whose\r\nInfluence four of the Judges have been prevailed upon to renounce\r\nthe Grants of the Crown and to declare their Resolution to depend\r\nupon the Grants of the Assembly for their future services. The\r\nChief Justice has acted a different part. The House of\r\nRepresentatives have addressed the Governor and Council to remove\r\nhim from his Office; they have impeached him of High Crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors, the Governor has refused, even though requested by\r\nthe Council, to appoint a time to determine on the matter, and\r\nfinally the House have Resolved that they have done all in their\r\nPower in their capacity to effect his removal and that the\r\nGovernor's refusal was presumed to be because he received HIS\r\nsupport from the Crown.\r\n\r\nAs the Papers inclosed contain so fully the Sentiments of the two\r\nHouses concerning this important matter, it is needless to make\r\nany observations thereon. The Assembly is prorogued and it is\r\nexpected will soon be Dissolved. Doubtless the People who in\r\ngeneral are greatly agitated with the conduct of the Governor,\r\nwill AT LEAST speculate very freely upon a subject so interesting\r\nto them. They see with resentment the effect of the Governor's\r\nindependency, That he is resolved to save a favorite (with whom\r\nhe has a connection by the intermarriage of their children) and\r\ntherein to set a precedent for future Independent Governors to\r\nestablish any corrupt officers against the remonstrances of the\r\nRepresentative Body. They despair of any Constitutional remedy,\r\nwhile the Governor of the Province is thus dependant upon\r\nMinisters of State against the most flagrant oppressions of a\r\ncorrupt Officer. They take it for certain that SUCH a Governor\r\nwill forever screen the conduct of SUCH an officer from\r\nexamination and prevent his removal, if he has reason to think it\r\nis expected he should so do by those upon whose favor he depends.\r\nOn the other hand his Majesty's Ministers, unless they are\r\nblinded by the plausible Colourings of designing men may see,\r\nthat by the present measures the People are provoked and\r\nirritated to such a degree, that it is not in the Power of a\r\nGovernor(whom they look upon as a mere Instrument of Power)\r\nthough born and educated in the Country, and for a long time\r\npossessed of a great share of the confidence and affections of\r\nthe People now to carry a single point which they the ministers\r\ncan recommend to him. And this will always be the case let who\r\nwill be Governor while by being made totally dependent on the\r\nCrown or perhaps more strictly speaking upon the Ministry, he is\r\nthus aliened from the People whose good he is and ought to be\r\nappointed. In such a state what is to be expected but warm and\r\nangry Debates between the Governor and the two Houses (while the\r\nAssembly is sitting instead of the joint consultation for the\r\npublic Welfare) and violent commotions among the People? It will\r\nbe in vain for any to expect that the people of this Country will\r\nnow be contented with a partial and temporary relief, or that\r\nthey will be amused by Court promises while they see not the\r\nleast relaxation of Grievances. By the vigilance and activity of\r\nCommittees of Correspondence among the several towns in the\r\nProvince they have been wonderfully enlightened and animated.\r\nThey are united in sentiment and their opposition to\r\nunconstitutional Measures of Government in become systematical,\r\nColony communicates freely with Colony. There is a common\r\nAffection * * * * * * * * * * * * * whole continent is now become\r\nunited in sentiment and opposition to tyranny. Their old good\r\nwill and affection for the Parent Country is not however lost, if\r\nshe returns to her former moderation and good humor their\r\naffection will revive. They wish for nothing more than permanent\r\nunion with her upon the condition of equal liberty. This is all\r\nthey have been contending for and nothing short of this will or\r\nought to satisfy them. When formerly the Kings of England have\r\nencroached upon the Liberties of their Subjects, the subjects\r\nhave thought it their Duty to themselves and their Posterity to\r\ncontend with them until they were restored to the footing of the\r\nConstitution. The events of such struggles have sometimes proved\r\nfatal to Crowned Heads--perhaps they have never issued but\r\nEstablishments of the People's Liberties. In those times it was\r\nnot thought reasonable to say, that since the King had claimed\r\nsuch or such a Power the People MUST yield it to him because it\r\nwould not be for the Honor of his Majesty to recede from his\r\nClaim. If the People of Britain must needs flatter themselves\r\nthat they collectively are the Sovereign of America, America will\r\nnever consent that they should govern them arbitrarily, or\r\nwithout known and stipulated Rules. But the matter is not so\r\nconsidered here: Britain and the Colonies are considered as\r\ndistinct Governments under the King. Britain has a Constitution\r\nthe envy of all Foreigners, to which it has ever been the safety\r\nas well of Kings as of subjects steadfastly to adhere. Each\r\nColony has also a Constitution in its Charter or other\r\nInstitution of Government; all of which agree in this that the\r\nfundamental Laws of the British Constitution shall be the Basis.\r\nThat Constitution by no means admits of Legislation without\r\nrepresentation. Why then should the Parliament of Britain which\r\nnotwithstanding all its Ideas of transcendant Power must forever\r\nbe circumscribed within the limits of that Constitution, insist\r\nupon the right of legislation for the people of America without\r\ntheir having Representation there? It cannot be justified by\r\ntheir own Constituion. The Laws of Nature and Reason abhor it;\r\nyet because she has claimed such a Power, her Honor truly is\r\nconcerned still to assert and excise it, and she may not recede.\r\nWill such kind of reasoning bear the test of Examination! Or\r\nrather will it not be an eternal disgrace to any nation which\r\nconsiders her Honor concerned to employ Fleets and Armies for the\r\nSupport of a claim which she cannot in Reason defend, merely\r\nbecause she has once in anger made such a Claim? It is the\r\nmisfortune of Britain and the Colonies that flagitious Men on\r\nboth sides the Water have made it their Interest to foment\r\ndivisions, Jealousies, and animosities between them, which\r\nperhaps will never subside until the Extent of Power and Right on\r\neach part is more explicitly stipulated than has ever yet been\r\nthought necessary, and although such a stipulation should prove a\r\nlasting advantage on each side, yet considering that the views\r\nand designs of those men were to do infinite mischief and to\r\nestablish a Tyranny upon the Ruins of a free constitution they\r\ndeserve the vengeance of the public, and till the memory of them\r\nshall be erased by time, they will most assuredly meet with the\r\nexecrations of Posterity.\r\n\r\nOur Lieutenant Governor Oliver is now dead.2 This event affords\r\nthe Governor a Plea for postponing his voyage to England till\r\nfurther orders. Had the Government by the absence of BOTH\r\ndevolved on the Council, his Majesty's service (which has been\r\nfrequently pleaded to give a Colouring to measures destructive of\r\nthe true Interests of his Subjects) would we are persuaded, have\r\nbeen really promoted. Among other things the Grants of the House\r\nwhich in the late session were repeated for the services of our\r\nAgents would have been passed. There is a degree of Insult in the\r\nGovernor's refusal of his consent to those Grants, for as his\r\nrefusal is grounded upon the Hopes that our Friends will thereby\r\nbe discouraged from further serving us, it is as much as to say\r\nthat there will be no Agents unless the Assembly will be content\r\nwith such as he shall prescribe for their choice. The House by a\r\nMessage urged the Governor to enable them to do their Agents\r\nJustice but in vain. This and other instances serve to show that\r\nthe Powers vested in the Governor are exercised to injure and\r\nProvoke the People.\r\n\r\nWe judge it to be the expectation of the House of Representatives\r\nthat you should warmly solicit the Earl of Dartmouth for his\r\nInterest that as well as other instructions which are grievous to\r\nus, more particularly those which relate to the disposition of\r\nour public * * * * * that which restrains the Governor from\r\nconsenting * * * * * to the Agents may be recalled. And his\r\nLordship ought to consider his Interest in this particular not as\r\na PERSONAL favor done to you but as a piece of Justice done to\r\nthe Province; and in the same light we strongly recommend it to\r\nyour own Consideration especially as we hope for a change in the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWe now write to you by the direction of the House of\r\nRepresentatives to the Committee of Correspondence, and are with\r\nvery great Regard,\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Committe\r\nSir,\r\nYour most humble servants,\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\n1Signed by Samuel Adams, John Hancock, William Phillips and\r\nWilliam Heath.

No ship has yet arrived. I cannot however\r\nomit writing to you by our worthy Friend Mr Watson, by whom I\r\nrecd your obliging Letter of the 27 Instant.\r\n\r\nAltho we have had no Arrival from Londn directly to this place,\r\nwe have heard from thence by the way of Philadelphia as you have\r\nobservd in the News papers. The Account they first receivd of our\r\nopposition to the East India Act, as it is called, particularly\r\nthe transactions at Liberty Tree, they treated with Scorn &\r\nRidicule; but when they heard of the Resolves of the Body of the\r\npeople at the old South Meeting house, the place from whence the\r\norders issued for the removal of the Troops in 1770, they put on\r\ngrave Countenances. No Notice is taken of America in the Kings\r\nSpeech. Our Tories tell us to expect Regiments [to be] quarterd\r\namong us. What Measures an unjudicious Ministry, (to say the\r\nleast of them) will take, cannot easily at present be foreseen;\r\nit will be wise for us to be ready for ALL EVENTS, that WE MAY\r\nMAKE THE BEST IMPROVEMENT OF THEM. It is probable that Mr\r\nHutchinson will make the Death of his Brother Oliver a plea for\r\npostponing a Voyage to London, and if Troops should arrive IT MAY\r\nBE BEST THAT HE SHOULD BE HERE.--I never suffer my Mind to be\r\never much disturbd with Prospects. Sufficient for the Day is the\r\nEvil thereof. It is our Duty at all Hazards to preserve the\r\npublick Liberty. Righteous Heaven will graciously smile on every\r\nmanly and rational Attempt to secure that best of all his Gifts\r\nto Man, from the ravishing Hand of lawless & brutal Power.\r\n\r\nMr Watson will inform you, what Steps [the] Come of\r\nCorrespondence have taken with regard to the Establishment of a\r\nPost Office upon constitutional Principles. Mr Goddard, who brot\r\nus Letters from New York, Newport & Providence relating to that\r\nSubject, is gone with Letters from us to the principal trading\r\nTowns as far as Portsmouth. I will acquaint you with the State of\r\nthe Affair when he returns, and our Come will I doubt not, then\r\nwrite to yours. The Colonies must unite to carry thro such [a]\r\nProject, and when the End is effected it will be a pretty grand\r\nAcquisition.\r\n\r\nI refer you also to Mr Watson, who can inform you respecting one\r\nof your Protecters who has been in Town. The Tryumph of your\r\nTories as well as ours will I hope be short. We must not however\r\nboast as he that putteth off the Harness. H--n is politically\r\nsick and [I] fancy despairs of returning Health. The \"law\r\nlearning\" Judge I am told is in the Horrors and the late\r\nLieutenant (joynt Author of a late Pamphlet intitled Letters &c.)\r\na few Weeks ago \"died & was buried\"--Excuse me from enlarging at\r\npresent. I intend to convince you that I am \"certainly a Man of\r\nmy Word\"--In the mean time with Assurance of unfeigned Friendship\r\nfor Mrs Warren and your agreable Family, in which Mrs Adams\r\njoyns, I remain\r\n\r\nYours Affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO THE COMMITTEE OF\r\n                        CORRESPONDENCE OF MARBLEHEAD.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library; a text,\r\nwith slight modifications, is in J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge\r\nGerry, vol. i. pp. 39-42.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 2d 1774\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nYesterday we receivd your Letter dated the 22d of March, wherein\r\nwe have the disagreeable Intelligence of your \"having resignd the\r\nseveral offices in which you have acted for the Town\" of\r\nMarblehead, and that you shall \"accept them no more--without\r\nmaterial Alteration in the Conduct of the Inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we heard of the unhappy Circumstances of that Town--The\r\nContest that had arisen to so great a Degree of Violence on\r\nAccount of the Hospital lately erected there, it gave us great\r\nConcern and Anxiety, lest it might issue to the Prejudice of the\r\nCommon Cause of American Freedom. We were apprehensive that the\r\nMinds of the Zealous Friends of that good Cause, being warmly\r\nagitated in such a Controversy, would become thereby disaffected\r\nto each other, and that the Advantage which we have hitherto\r\nexperienced from their united Efforts would cease. We are\r\nconfirmd that our Fears were not ill grounded, by your\r\nrelinquishing a Post, which, in our Opinion, and we dare say in\r\nthe Opinion of your Fellow Townsmen you sustaind with Honor to\r\nyour selves and Advantage to your Country. But Gentlemen, Suffer\r\nus to ask, Whether you well considerd, that although you derivd\r\nyour Being as a Committee of Correspondence from that particular\r\nTown which appointed you, yet in the Nature of your office, while\r\nthey continued you in it you stood connected in a peculiar\r\nRelation with your Country. If this be a just View of it, Should\r\nthe ill Conduct of the Inhabitants of Marblehead towards you,\r\ninfluence you to decline serving the publick in this office, any\r\nmore than that of the Inhabitants of this or any other Town? And\r\nwould you not therefore have continued in that office, though you\r\nhad been obligd to resign every other office you held under the\r\nTown, without Injury to your own Reputation? Besides will the\r\nMisfortune end in this Resignation? Does not the Step naturally\r\nlead you to withdraw your selves totally from the publick\r\nMeetings of the Town, however important to the Common Cause, by\r\nwhich the other firm Friends to that honorable Cause may feel the\r\nWant of your Influence and Aid, at a time when, as you well\r\nexpress it \"a FATAL Thrust may be aimed at our Rights and\r\nLiberties,\" and it may be necessary that all should appear, & \"as\r\none Body\" oppose the Design & defeat the Rebel Intent? Should not\r\nthe Disorders that have prevaild and still prevail in the Town of\r\nMarblehead, have been a weighty Motive rather for your taking\r\nMeasures to strengthen your Connections with the People than\r\notherwise; that you might in Conjunction with other prudent Men,\r\nhave employed your Influence & Abilities in reducing to the\r\nExercise of Reason those who had been governd by Prejudice and\r\nPassion, & they have brought the Contest to an equitable &\r\namicable Issue, which would certainly have been to your own\r\nSatisfaction. If Difficulties stared you in the Face, it is a\r\ngood Maxim NIL DESPERANDUM; and are you sure that it was\r\nimpracticable for you, by Patience and Assiduity, to have\r\nrestored \"Order & Distinction\" and renderd the publick offices of\r\nthe Town again respectable?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to enumerate all the Instances in which our\r\nEnemies, as watchful as they are inveterate, will make an ill\r\nImprovement of your Letter of resignation. And therefore we\r\nearnestly wish that a Method may yet be contrived for the\r\nRecalling of it consistent with your own Sentiments. We assure\r\nour Selves that personal Considerations will not be sufferd to\r\nhave an undue Weight in your Minds, when the publick Liberty in\r\nwhich is involvd the Happiness of your own as well as the\r\nChildren of those who have ill treated you, & whom to rescue from\r\nBondage will afford you the most exalted Pleasure, is in Danger\r\nof suffering Injury.\r\n\r\nWe wish most ardently that by the Exercise of Moderation &\r\nPrudence the Differences subsisting among the good People of\r\nMarblehead may be settled upon righteous Terms. And as we are\r\ninformd that the Town at their late Meeting did not see Cause to\r\nmake Choice of other Gentlemen in your Room in Consequence of\r\nyour declining to serve any longer as a Committee of\r\nCorrespondence, we beg Leave still to consider & address you in\r\nthat Character.\r\n\r\nWe are with unfeigned Respect,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Addressed to \"Azor Orne Esqr & other Gentlemen of the Committee\r\nof Correspondence for Marblehead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 215-220.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, April 4th, 1774.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--My last letter to you I delivered to the care of\r\nDr. Williamson, who sailed with Capt. ----------in December last.\r\nThe general assembly has since been sitting, and the important\r\nsubject of the judges of the superior court being made dependent\r\non the crown for thier salaries, was again taken up by the house\r\nof representatives with spirit and firmness. The house had in a\r\nformer session passed divers resolutions expressing their sense\r\nof the dangerous tendency of this innovation, and declaring that\r\nunless the justices should renounce the salaries from the crown,\r\nand submit to a constitutional dependence upon the the assembly\r\nfor their support, they would proceed to impeach them before the\r\ngovernor and council. One of them, Mr. Trowbridge, very early in\r\nthe session, in a letter to the speaker, expressed his former\r\ncompliance with that resolve, which letter was communicated to\r\nthe house and voted satisfactory. The other four had taken no\r\nnotice of the resolve. The house therefore having waited from the\r\n26th of January, which was the first day of the session, till the\r\n1st of February, then came to a resolution, that unless they\r\nshould conform to their order on or before the fourth of the same\r\nmonth, farther proceedings would be had on such neglect. The\r\neffect of this resolve was, that three of them, viz:--Hutchinson,\r\n(a brother to him who is called governor), --------, ----------,\r\nmade similar declarations to that of Trowbridge, which were also\r\nvoted satisfactory. Mr. Justice Oliver, who is a brother of the\r\nlieutenant-governor, and is connected with the governor by the\r\nmarriage of their children, came to a different determination;\r\nwhich occasioned a controversy between the governor and the two\r\nhouses, inserted at large in the enclosed papers. Therein you\r\nwill see that the governor has treated the petitions, complaints,\r\nand remonstrances of the representative body, with haughty\r\ncontempt. The people view it with deep resentment as an effect of\r\nhis independency; whereby he is aliened from them, and become a\r\nfitter instrument in the hands of the ministry to carry into\r\neffect their destructive plans. They are irritated to the highest\r\ndegree, and despair of any constitutional remedy against the\r\noppressions of a corrupt officer, while the governor, BE HE WHO\r\nHE MAY, is thus dependent on ministers of state. They have ever\r\nsince the trial of Preston and his soldiers been murmuring at the\r\nconduct of the superior court, and the partiality which many say\r\nis so clearly discovered in causes between revenue officers and\r\nthe government, abettors, and other subjects. Indeed, the house\r\nof representatives two or three years ago passed a resolution\r\nthat such conduct in several instances had been observed, as\r\nappears in their printed journals. To give you some idea of what\r\nthe temper of that court has been, a lawyer1 of great eminence in\r\nthe province, and a member of the house of representatives, was\r\nthrown over the bar a few days ago, because he explained in a\r\npublic newspaper the sentiments he had advanced in the house when\r\nhe had been misrepresented; and a young lawyer of great genius in\r\nthis town, who had passd the regular course of study, (which is\r\nmore than can be said of the chief-justice) has been and is still\r\nrefused by the governor, only because he mentioned the name of\r\nHutchinson with freedom, and that not in court, but in a Boston\r\ntown-meeting some years before. And to show you from whence this\r\ninfluence springs, I must inform you that not long ago the\r\ngovernor, the lieutenant-governor, and three of the judges, which\r\nmake a majority of the bench, were nearly related; and even now\r\nthe governor has a brother there, and is brother-in-law to the\r\nchief-justice. Such combinations are justly formidable, and the\r\npeople view them with a jealous eye. They clearly see through a\r\nsystem formed for their destruction. That the parliament of\r\nBritain is to make laws, binding them in all cases whatsoever;\r\nthat the colonies are to be taxed by that parliament without\r\ntheir own consent; and the crown enabled to appropriate money for\r\nthe support of the executive and arbitrary powers; that this\r\nleaves their own assembly a body of very little significance;\r\nwhile the officers of government and judges, are to be totally\r\nindependent of the legislature, and altogether under the control\r\nof the king's ministers and counselors; and there an union will\r\nbe effected, as dangerous as it will be powerful; the whole power\r\nof government will be lifted from the hands into which the\r\nconstitution has placed it, into the hands of the king's\r\nministers and their dependents here. This is in a great measure\r\nthe case already; and the consequences will be, angry debates in\r\nour senate, and perpetual tumults and confusions abroad; until\r\nthese maxims are entirely altered, or else, which God forbid, the\r\nspirits of the people are depressed, and they become inured to\r\ndisgrace and servitude. This has long been the prospect in the\r\nminds of speculative men. The body of the people are now in\r\ncouncil. Their opposition grows into a system. They are united\r\nand resolute. And if the British administration and government do\r\nnot return to the principles of moderation and equity, the evil\r\nwhich they profess to aim at preventing by their rigorous\r\nmeasures, will the sooner be brought to pass, viz:--THE ENTIRE\r\nSEPARATION AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing obliged me with a sight of your letter to him of the\r\n22d Dec. last. I think I am not so clearly of opinion as you seem\r\nto be, that \"the declaratory act is a mere nullity,\" and that\r\ntherefore \"if we can obtain a repeal of the revenue acts from\r\n1764, without their pernicious appendages, it will be enough.\"\r\nShould they retract the exercise of their assumed power, you ask\r\nwhen will they be able to renew it? I know not when, but I fear\r\nthey will soon do it, unless, as your worthy brother in Virginia\r\nin a letter I yesterday received from him expresses himself, \"we\r\nmake one uniform, steady effort to secure an explicit bill of\r\nrights for British America.\" Let the executive power and right on\r\neach side be therein stipulated, that Britain may no longer have\r\na power or right to make laws to bind us, in all cases\r\nwhatsoever. While the claim is kept up, she may exercise the\r\npower as often as she pleases; and the colonies have experienced\r\nher disposition to do it too plainly since she in anger made the\r\nclaim. Even imaginary power beyond right begets insolence. The\r\npeople here I am apt to think will be satisfied on no other terms\r\nbut those of redress; and they will hardly think they are upon\r\nequitable terms with the mother country, while by a solemn act\r\nshe continues to claim a right to enslave them, whenever she\r\nshall think fit to exercise it. I wish for a permanent union with\r\nthe mother country, but only on the principles of liberty and\r\ntruth. No advantage that can accrue to America from such an union\r\ncan compensate for the loss of liberty. The time may come sooner\r\nthan they are aware of it, when the being of the British nation,\r\nI mean the being of its importance, however strange it may now\r\nappear to some, will depend on her union with America. It\r\nrequires but a small portion of the gift of discernment for any\r\none to foresee, that providence will erect a mighty empire in\r\nAmerica; and our posterity will have it recorded in history, that\r\ntheir fathers migrated from an ISLAND in a distant part of the\r\nworld, the inhabitants of which had long been revered for wisdom\r\nand valour. They grew rich and powerful; these emigrants\r\nincreased in numbers and strength. But they were at last absorbed\r\nin luxury and dissipation; and to support themselves in their\r\nvanity and extravagance they coveted and seized the honest\r\nearnings of those industrious emigrants. This laid a foundation\r\nof distrust, animosity and hatred, till the emigrants, feeling\r\ntheir own vigour and independence, dissolved every former band of\r\nconnexion between them, and the ISLANDERS sunk into obscurity and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nMay I whisper in your ear that you paid a compliment to the\r\nspeaker when you told him you \"always spoke under the correction\r\nof his better judgment.\" I admire what you say to him, and I hope\r\nit will have a good impression on his mind; THAT WE SHALL BE\r\nRESPECTED IN ENGLAND EXACTLY IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS AND\r\nSTRENGTH OF OUR OPPOSITION.\r\n\r\nI am sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\nAs Capt. Wood is now about to sail, there is not time to have\r\ncopies of the papers; I will send them by the next opportunity.\r\nIn the mean time I refer you to Dr. Franklin, to whom they are\r\nsent by this vessel.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Joseph Hawley, Esq., of North Hampton.

Wood being still detained, I have the\r\nopportunity of acknowledging your favour of the 22d Dec. last,1\r\nwhich is just now come to my hand. As Mr. Cushing received your\r\nletter of the same date near three weeks ago, I am at a loss to\r\nconjecture the reason of my not receiving it at the same time.\r\n\r\nI do not depend much upon Lord Dartmouth's inclination to relieve\r\nAmerica, upon terms which we shall think honourable; upon his\r\nability to do it, I have no dependence at all. He might have said\r\nwith safety, when called upon by Lord Shelburne, that he had\r\nprepared a plan to pursue at the hazard of his office; for I have\r\nreason to believe it was grounded upon the hopes that we could be\r\nprevailed upon, at least impliedly, to renounce our claims. This\r\nwould have been an acceptable service to the ministry, and would\r\nhave secured to him his office. No great advantage can be made\r\nagainst us from the letter which you mention to Lord Dartmouth\r\nfrom the two houses of our assembly; for upon a review of it I\r\nthink the most that is said in it is, that if we are brought back\r\nto the state we were in at the close of the last war, we shall be\r\nas easy as we then were. I do not like any thing that looks like\r\naccommodating our language to the humour of a minister; and am\r\nfully of your opinion that \"the harmony and concurrence of the\r\ncolonies, is of a thousand times more importance in our dispute,\r\nthan the friendship or patronage of any great man in England.\"\r\n\r\nAt the request of our friend, Mr. Hancock, I beg your acceptance\r\nof an oration delivered by him on the fifth of March last. I\r\nintend to write to you again very soon; in the mean time I remain\r\nyour assured friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1R. H.

This\r\nInstitution in a great Measure answers the Design of it, which\r\nis, to preserve in the Minds of the People a lively Sense of the\r\nDanger of standing Armies. We are again threatned with that great\r\nEvil; the British Ministry being highly provoked at the Conduct\r\nof the People here in destroying the East India Companys Tea.\r\nThey shut their Eyes to what might appear obvious to them, that\r\nthe Governors Refusal to suffer it to repass our Castle,\r\ncompelled to that Extremity. The Disappointment of the Ministry,\r\nand, no doubt, the Govrs aggravated Representations, have\r\ninflamed them to the highest Degree. May God prepare this People\r\nfor the Event, by inspiring them with Wisdom and Fortitude! At\r\nthe same time they stand in Need of all the Countenance that\r\ntheir Sister Colonies can afford them; with whom to cultivate and\r\nstrengthen an Union, was a great object in View. WE have borne a\r\ndouble Share of ministerial Resentment, in every Period of the\r\nStruggle for American Freedom. I hope this is not to be\r\nattributed to our having, in general, imprudently acted our Part.\r\nIs it not rather owing to our having had constantly, Governors\r\nand other Crown officers residing among us, whose Importance\r\ndepended solely upon their blowing up the flame of Contention? We\r\nare willing to submit our Conduct to the Judgment of our Friends,\r\n& would gladly receive their Advice.\r\n\r\nColl Lee the Bearer of this Letter and Mr Dalton his Companion,\r\nare travelling as far as Maryland. They are Gentlemen of Fortune\r\nand Merit; and will be greatly disappointed if they should miss\r\nthe Pleasure of seeing the common Friend of America, The\r\nPennsylvania Farmer. Allow me, Sir, to recommend them to you, and\r\nto assure you that I am with great Sincerity,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate Friend and humble servt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T.

The\r\nParliament have taken upon them, from the Representations of our\r\nGovernor & other Persons inimical to and deeply prejudiced,\r\nagainst the Inhabitants, to try, condemn and by an Act to punish\r\nthem, UNHEARD; which would have been in Violation of NATURAL\r\nJUSTICE even if they had an acknowledgd Jurisdiction. They have\r\norderd our port to be entirely shut up, leaving us barely so much\r\nof the Means of Subsistance as to keep us from perishing with\r\nCold and Hunger; and it is said, that [a] Fleet of British Ships\r\nof War is to block up our Harbour, until we shall make\r\nRestitution to the East India Company, for the Loss of their Tea,\r\nwhich was destroyed therein the Winter past, Obedience is paid to\r\nthe Laws and Authority of Great Britain, and the Revenue is duly\r\ncollected. This Act fills the Inhabitants with Indignation. The\r\nmore thinking part of those who have hitherto been in favor of\r\nthe Measures of the British Government, look upon it as not to\r\nhave been expected even from a barbarous State. This Attack,\r\nthough made immediately upon us, is doubtless designd for every\r\nother Colony, who will not surrender their sacred Rights &\r\nLiberties into the Hands of an infamous Ministry. Now therefore\r\nis the Time, when ALL should be united in opposition to this\r\nViolation of the Liberties of ALL. Their grand object is to\r\ndivide the Colonies. We are well informd, that another Bill is to\r\nbe brought into Parliament, to distinguish this from the other\r\nColonies, by repealing some of the Acts which have been complaind\r\nof and ease the American Trade; but be assured, YOU will be\r\ncalled upon to surrender your Rights, if ever they should succeed\r\nin their Attempts to suppress the Spirit of Liberty HERE. The\r\nsingle Question then is, Whether YOU consider Boston as now\r\nsuffering in the Common Cause, & sensibly feel and resent the\r\nInjury and Affront offerd to her? If you do, (and we cannot\r\nbelieve otherwise) May we not from your Approbation of our former\r\nConduct, in Defence of American Liberty, rely on your suspending\r\nyour Trade with Great Britain at least, which, it is acknowledgd,\r\nwill be a great, but necessary Sacrifice, to the Cause of\r\nLiberty, and will effectually defeat the Design of this Act of\r\nRevenge. If this should be done, you will please to consider it\r\nwill be, though a voluntary Suffering, greatly short of what we\r\nare called to endure under the immediate hand of Tyranny.\r\n\r\nWe desire your Answer by the Bearer; and after assuring you,\r\nthat, not in the least intimidated by this inhumane Treatment we\r\nare still determind to maintain to the utmost of our Abilities\r\nthe Rights of America we are,\r\n\r\nGentlemen,\r\nyour Friends & Fellow Countrymen,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Intended also for the Committees of Correspondence of New York,\r\nNew Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Portsmouth.

If the Parliament had a Right to\r\npass such an EDICT, does it not discover the want of every moral\r\nprinciple to proceed to the destruction of a community, without\r\neven the accusation of any crime committed by such community? And\r\nfor any thing that appears, this is in fact the case. There is no\r\ncrime alleged in the Act, as committed by the Town of Boston.\r\nOutrages have been committed within the Town, and therefore the\r\ncommunity, as such, are to be destroyed, without duly inquiring\r\nwhether it deserved any punishment at all. Has there not often\r\nbeen the same kind of reason why the Port of London should be\r\nshut up, to the starving of hundreds of thousands, when their own\r\nmobs have surrounded the Kings Palace? But such are the councils\r\nof a nation, once famed and revered for the character of humane\r\njust and brave.\r\n\r\nThe people receive this cruel edict with abhorrence and\r\nindignation. They consider themselves as suffering the stroke\r\nministerial--I may more precisely say, Hutchinsonian vengeance,\r\nin the common cause of America. I hope they will sustain the blow\r\nwith a becoming fortitude, and that the cursed design of\r\nintimidating and subduing the spirits of all America, will, by\r\nthe joint efforts of ALL, be frustrated. It is the expectation of\r\nour enemies, and some of our friends are afraid, that this Town,\r\nSINGLY, will not be able to support the cause under so severe a\r\ntrial. Did not the very being of every sea-port town, and indeed\r\nof every Colony, considered as a free people, depend upon it, I\r\nwould not even then entertain a thought so dishonorable of them\r\nas that they would leave us now to struggle alone.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of a vote, passed by this Town at a very\r\nfull meeting yesterday, which stands adjourned till Wednesday\r\nnext, to receive the report of a committee appointed to consider\r\nwhat is proper further to be done. The inhabitants in general\r\nabhor the thought of paying for the tea, which is one condition\r\nupon which we are to be restored to the grace and favor of Great\r\nBritain. Our Committee of Correspondence have written letters to\r\nour friends in the Southern Colonies, and they are about writing\r\nto the several towns in this Province. The merchants of\r\nNewburyport have exhibited a noble example of public spirit, in\r\nresolving that, if the other sea-port Towns in this Province\r\nalone, will come into the measure, they will not trade to the\r\nsouthward of South Carolina, nor to any part of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, till the harbor of Boston is again open and free; or\r\ntill the disputes between Britain and the Colonies are settled,\r\nupon such terms as all rational men ought to contend for. This is\r\na manly and generous resolution. I wish Plymouth, which has\r\nhitherto stood foremost, would condescend to second Newburyport.\r\nSuch a determination put into practice would alter the views of a\r\nnation, who are in full expectation that Boston will be unthought\r\nof by the rest of the continent, and even of this Province, and\r\nleft, as they are devoted, to ruin. The heroes who first trod on\r\nyour shore, fed on clams and muscles, and were contented. The\r\ncountry which they explored, and defended with their richest\r\nblood, and which they transmitted as an inheritance to their\r\nposterity, affords us a superabundance of provision. Will it not\r\nbe an eternal disgrace to this generation, if it should now be\r\nsurrendered to that people who, if we might judge of them by one\r\nof their laws, are barbarians. IMPIUS HAEC TAM CULTA NOVALIA\r\nMILES HABEBIT? BARBARUS HAS SEGETES? If our brethren feel and\r\nresent the affront and injury now offered to this town; if they\r\nrealize of how great importance it is to the liberties of all\r\nAmerica that Boston should sustain this shock with dignity; if\r\nthey recollect their own resolutions, to defend the public\r\nliberty AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR FORTUNES AND LIVES, they cannot\r\nfail to contribute their aid by a temporary suspension of their\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nI am your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SILAS DEANE.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text, with\r\nvariations, is in Correspondence of Samuel B.

I trust in God,\r\nwe shall never be so servile as to submit to the ignominious\r\nTerms of the cruel Edict; aided by our Sister Colonies, we shall\r\nbe able to acquit ourselves, under this severe Tryal, with\r\nDignity. But that Aid must be speedy, otherwise we shall not be\r\nable to keep up the Spirits of the more irresolute amongst us,\r\nbefore whom the crafty Adversaries are already holding up the\r\ngrim Picture of Want and Misery. It is feard by the Committee\r\nthat a Conferrence of Committees of Correspondence from all the\r\nColonies, cannot be had speedily enough to answer for the present\r\nEmergency. If your honbl Committee shall think it proper to use\r\ntheir Influence with the Merchants in the Sea port Towns in\r\nConnecticutt to withhold--& prevail with those of each town for\r\nthemselves--their Trade with Great Britain and Ireland and every\r\nPart of the West Indies, to commence at a certain time (say on\r\nthe 14th June next) it will be a great Sacrifice indeed, but not\r\ngreater than Americans have given the World Reason to expect from\r\nthem when called to offer it for the preservation of the publick\r\nLiberty.One years virtuous forbearance wd succeed to our wishes.\r\n2What would this be in Comparison with the Sacrifice our renowned\r\nAncestors made that they might quietly enjoy their Liberties\r\ncivil & religious? They left, many of them, affluence in their\r\nNative Country, crossd an untryed Ocean, encounterd the\r\nDifficulties of cultivating a howling wilderness, defended their\r\nInfant Settlements against a most barbarous Enemy with their\r\nrichest Blood.\r\n\r\nYour Sentiment that Boston is \"suffering in the common Cause\" is\r\njust and humane. Your obliging Letter has precluded any Necessity\r\nof urging your utmost Exertions, that Connecticut may at this\r\nJuncture act her part in the Support of that common Cause,\r\nthough the Attack is made more immediately on the Town of Boston.\r\nBeing at present pressd for time I cannot write so largely as I\r\nfeel disposd to do. I must therefore conclude with assuring you\r\nthat I am with very great Regard for your Come\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nyour sincere Friend and Fellow Countryman,\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\n1Addressed to Deane at Hartford, Connecticut.\r\n2The following two sentences are stricken out in the draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN HOPKINS1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON May 18 1774\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nYou have without Doubt heard of the Edict of the British\r\nParliament to shut up the Harbour of Boston, the Injustice &\r\nCruelty of which cannot be parralled [sic] in the English\r\nHistory. Injustice, in trying condemning and punishing upon the\r\nmere Representations of interrested Men, without calling the\r\nParty to answer; and Cruelty in the Destruction of a whole\r\nCommunity only because it is alledgd that Outrage has been\r\ncommitted in it, without the least Enquiry whether the Community\r\nhave been to blame. The Town of Boston now suffer the Stroke of\r\nministerial Vengeance in the Common Cause of America; and I hope\r\nin God they will sustain the Shock with Dignity. They do not\r\nconceive that their Safety consists in their Servile Compliance\r\nwith the ignominious Terms of this barbarous Act. Supported by\r\ntheir Brethren of the Sister Colonies I am perswaded they will\r\nnobly defeat the diabolical Designs of the common Enemies. If the\r\nSpirit of American Liberty is suppressd in this Colony, which is\r\nundoubtedly the Plan, where will the Victory lead to and end? I\r\nneed not urge upon YOU the Necessity of the joynt Efforts of all\r\nin the Defence of this single Post. I know your great Weight and\r\nInfluence in the Colony of Rhode Island, and intreat that you\r\nwould now employ it for the common Safety of America.

Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 221-223; a draft is\r\nin the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text is in Force,\r\nAmerican Archives, 4th ser., vol. i., p. 332.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, May 18th, 1774.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--The edict of the British parliament, commonly\r\ncalled the Boston Port Act, came safely to my hand. For flagrant\r\ninjustice and barbarity, one might search in vain among the\r\narchives of Constantinople to find a match for it. But what else\r\ncould have been expected from a parliament, too long under the\r\ndictates and control of an administration, which seems to be\r\ntotally lost to all sense and feeling of morality, and governed\r\nby passion, cruelty, and revenge. For us to reason against SUCH\r\nan act, would be idleness. Our business is to find means to evade\r\nits malignant design. The inhabitants view it, not with\r\nastonishment, but indignation. They discover the utmost contempt\r\nof the framers of it; while they are yet disposed to consider the\r\nbody of the nation (though represented by such a parliament) in\r\nthe character they have sustained heretofore, humane and\r\ngenerous. They resent the behaviour of the merchants in London,\r\nthose I mean who receive their bread from them, in infamously\r\ndeserting their cause at the time of extremity. They can easily\r\nbelieve that the industrious manufacturers, whose time is wholly\r\nspent in their various employments, are misled and imposed upon\r\nby such miscreants as have ungratefully devoted themselves to an\r\nabandoned ministry, not regarding the ruin of those who have been\r\ntheir best benefactors. But the inhabitants of this town must and\r\nwill look to their own safety, which they see does not consist in\r\na servile compliance with the ignominious terms of this barbarous\r\nedict. Though the means of preserving their liberties should\r\ndistress and even ruin the British manufacturers, they are\r\nresolved (but with reluctance) to try the experiment. To this\r\nthey are impelled by motives of self-preservation. They feel\r\nhumanely to those who must suffer, but being innocent are not the\r\nobjects of their revenge. They have already called upon their\r\nsister colonies, (as you will see by the enclosed note) who not\r\nonly feel for them as fellow-citizens, but look upon them as\r\nsuffering the stroke of ministerial vengeance in the common cause\r\nof America; that cause which the colonies have pledged themselves\r\nto each other not to give up. In the mean time I trust in God\r\nthis devoted town will sustain the shock with dignity; and\r\nsupported by their brethren, will gloriously defeat the designs\r\nof thier common enemies. Calmness, courage, and unanimity\r\nprevail. While they are resolved not tamely to submit, they will\r\nby refraining from any acts of violence, avoid the snare they\r\nthey discover to be laid for them, by posting regiments so near\r\nthem. I heartily thank you for your spirited exertions. Use means\r\nfor the preservation of your health. Our warmest gratitude is due\r\nto lords Camden and Shelburne. Our dependence is upon the wisdom\r\nof the few of the British nobility. We suspect studied insult, in\r\nthe appointment of the person who is commander-in-chief of the\r\ntroops in America to be our governor; and I think ther appears to\r\nbe in it more than a design to insult upon any specious pretence.\r\nWe will endeavour by circumspection and sound prudence, to\r\nfrustrate the diabolical designs of our enemies.\r\n\r\nI have written in haste, and am affectionately your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 46, 47.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, May 20, 1774.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have just time to acquaint you that yesterday our committee of\r\ncorrespondence received an express from New York, with a letter\r\nfrom thence, dated the 15th instant, informing that a ship\r\narrived there after a passage of twenty-seven days from London,\r\nwith the detested act for shutting up this port; that the\r\ncitizens of New York resented the treatment of Boston, as a most\r\nviolent and barbarous attack on the rights of all America; that\r\nthe general cry was, let the port of New York voluntarily share\r\nthe fate of Boston; that the merchants were to meet on Tuesday\r\nlast, and it was the general opinion that they would entirely\r\nsuspend all commercial connexion with Great Britain, and not\r\nsupply the West Indies with hoops, staves, lumber, &c.; that they\r\nhoped the merchants in this and every colony would come into the\r\nmeasure, as it was of the last importance.\r\n\r\nExcuse me, I am in great haste,\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO THE COMMITTEE OF\r\nCORRESPONDENCE OF MARBLEHEAD.\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON May 22 1774\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nWe have just receivd your favor of this Date by the Hands of Mr\r\nFoster. We cannot too highly applaud your Sollicitude & Zeal in\r\nthe Common Cause. The News you mention as having been receivd\r\nhere from New York by the Post is without Foundation. We have\r\nreceivd a Letter from New York dated the Day before the Post came\r\nout from that City, advising us that there was to be a meeting of\r\nthe merchants there on the Tuesday following (last Tuesday)--that\r\nby a Vessel which had arrivd there from London the Citizens had\r\nreceivd the barbarous Act with Indignation--that no Language\r\ncould express their Abhorrence of this additional Act of Tyranny\r\nto all America--that they were fully perswaded that America was\r\nattackd & intended to be enslavd by their distressing & subduing\r\nBoston--that a Compliance with the provision of the Act will only\r\nbe a temporary Reliefe from a particular Evil, which must end in\r\na general Calamity--that many timid People in that City who have\r\ninterrested themselves but very little in the Controversy with\r\nGreat Britain express the greatest resentment at the Conduct of\r\nthe Ministry to this Town and consider the Treatment as if done\r\nto them--and that this is the general Sense of the Inhabitants--\r\nthat it was the general Talk that at the Meeting of the Merchants\r\nit would be agreed to suspend commercial Connection with Great\r\nBritain--also to stop the Exportation of Hoops Staves Heading &\r\nLumber to the English Islands, & export no more of those Articles\r\nto foreign Islands than will be sufficient to bring home the\r\nSugar Rum & Molasses for the Return of American Cargoes, and we\r\nare to be advisd of the Result of the meeting, which we expect\r\nvery soon. The Express which we sent to New York had not arrivd\r\nwhen this left the City.\r\n\r\nWe have receivd Letters by the post from Portsmt in New\r\nHampshire, from Hartford Newport Providence Westerly &c. all\r\nexpressing the same Indignation and a Determination to joyn in\r\nlike measures--restrictions on their Trade.\r\n\r\nHutchinsons minions are endeavoring to promote an address to him.\r\nThe PROFESSD design is to desire his Friendship; but we take it\r\nrather to be a Design of his own, that when he arrives in England\r\nhe may have THE SHADOW of Importance. It is carried on in a\r\nprivate Way--and is said to be signd by not fifty--Names of\r\nlittle Significance here may serve to make a Sound abroad.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to hear that Mr Hooper is throwing his Weight &\r\nInfluence into the Scale against us. We can scarcely believe it.\r\nIf it be true we would desire to know of him whether he would\r\nadvise the Town of Boston to give up the rights of America.\r\n\r\nWe conclude in haste,\r\n\r\nWe are credibly informd that in the address to Hutchinson are\r\nthese remarkeable Words \"We see no harm in your Letters and\r\napprove of them.\" The most intelligent & respectable merchants\r\namong those who have been reputed Tories have refused to sign it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON May 30 1774\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI receivd your very obliging Letter by the hands of Mr Revere. I\r\nthank you for the warm Affection you therein express for this\r\nTown, your Zeal for the Common Cause of America, and your prudent\r\nand salutary Advice. I hope in God that this People will sustain\r\nthemselves under their pressing Difficulties with Firmness. It is\r\nhard to restrain the Resentment of some within the proper Bounds,\r\nand to keep others who are more irresolute from sinking. While we\r\nare resolved not tamely to comply with the humiliating terms of\r\nthe barbarous Edict, I hope, by refraining from every Act of\r\nViolence we shall avoid the Snare that is laid for us by the\r\nposting of Regiments so near us. We shall endeavor by\r\nCircumspection to frustrate the diabolical Designs of our\r\nEnemies.\r\n\r\nOur Committee of Correspondence will write an Answer to the\r\nLetter they receivd from yours by this opportunity. In order that\r\nyou may have an Understanding of our Appointment I think it\r\nnecessary to inform you, that we are a Committee, not of the\r\nTrade, but of the whole Town; chosen to be as it were outguards\r\nto watch the Designs of our Enemies. We were appointed near two\r\nyears ago, and have a Correspondence with almost every Town in\r\nthe Colony. By this Means we have been able to circulate the most\r\nearly Intelligence of Importance to our Friends in the Country, &\r\nto establish an Union which is formidable to our Adversaries.\r\n\r\nBut it is the Trade that we must at present depend upon for that\r\nSPEEDY Reliefe which the Necessity of this Town requires. The\r\nTrade will forever be divided when a Sacrifice of their Interest\r\nis called for. By far the greater part of the Merchants of this\r\nplace are & ever have been steadfast in the Cause of their\r\nCountry; but a small Number may defeat the good Intentions of the\r\nrest, and there are some Men among them, perhaps more weak than\r\nwicked, who think it a kind of Reputation to them to appear\r\nzealous in Vindication of the Measures of Tyranny, and these it\r\nis said are tempted by the Commissioners of the Customs, with\r\nIndulgencies in their Trade. Nevertheless it is of the greatest\r\nImportance that some thing should be done for the immediate\r\nSupport of this Town. A Congress is of absolute Necessity in my\r\nOpinion, but from the length of time it will take to bring it to\r\npass, I fear it cannot answer for the present Emergency. The Act\r\nof Parliament shuts up our Port. Is it not necessary to push for\r\na Suspension of Trade with Great Britain as far as it will go,\r\nand let the yeomanry (whose Virtue must finally save this\r\nCountry) resolve to desert those altogether who will not come\r\ninto the Measure. This will certainly alarm the Manufacturers in\r\nBritain, who felt more than our Enemies would allow, the last\r\nNonimportation Agreement. The virtuous forbearance of the Friends\r\nof Liberty may be powerful enough to command Success. Our Enemies\r\nare already holding up to the Tradesmen the grim Picture of\r\nMisery and Want, to induce them to yield to Tyranny. I hope they\r\nwill not prevail upon them but this is to be feard, unless their\r\nBrethren in the other Colonies will agree upon Measures of SPEEDY\r\nSupport and Reliefe.\r\n\r\nIt gives me the greatest pleasure to find our worthy Friend the\r\nFarmer2 at the head of a respectable Committee. Pray let him know\r\nthat I am fully of his Sentiments. Violence & Submission would at\r\nthis time be equally fatal.\r\n\r\nI write in the utmost haste.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate Friend,\r\n__________\r\n\r\nYou will see in some of our Papers of this day an infamous\r\nAddress to Hutchinson signd by a Number who call themselves\r\nMerchants Traders & others. In this List of Subscribers are\r\ncontaind the Names of his party taken after abundance of Pains\r\nfrom every Class of Men down to the lowest. I verily believe I\r\ncould point out half a Score Gentlemen in Town able to purchase\r\nthe whole of them. For their understanding I refer you to the\r\nAddress itself. There is also another Paper of this Kind\r\nsubscribed by those who call themselves Lawyers. It was refused\r\nwith Indignation by some who for Learning & Virtue are\r\nacknowledgd to be the greatest Ornaments of that Profession. The\r\nSubscribers are taken from all parts of the Province. A few of\r\nthem are allowed to be of Ability--others of none--others have\r\nlately purchasd their Books and are now about to read. This List\r\nyou will observe is headed by one of our Judges of the\r\nAdmiraltry, & seconded by another--there is also the Solicitor\r\nGeneral (a Wedderburne in Principle but not equal to him in\r\nAbility) the Advocate General &c &c. The whole Design of these\r\nAddresses is to prop a sinking Character in England.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Later secretary of the Continental Congress.\r\n2John Dickinson.

I have just now received\r\nIntelligence(and I am apt to believe it) that several Regiments\r\nare to be posted in the Town. What can this mean but to pick a\r\nQuarrel with the Inhabitants, and to provoke them to take some\r\nviolent Steps from whence they may have a specious Pretence to\r\ncarry Matters to the greatest Extremity. We shall be hard pressd;\r\nand it will be difficult for us to preserve among the people that\r\nEquanimity which is necessary in such arduous Times. The only Way\r\nthat I can at present think of to bring the Ministry to their\r\nSenses, is to make the people of Great Britain share in the\r\nMisfortunes which they bring upon us; and this cannot be done so\r\nspeedily as the Emergency calls for, but by a Suspension of Trade\r\nwith them. I think that should be pushd as far as it will go & as\r\nspeedily as possible. Although the interrested & disaffected\r\nMerchants should not come into it, great Success may attend it.\r\nLet the yeomanry of the Continent, who only, under God, must\r\nfinally save this Country, break off all commercial Connection\r\nwhatever with those who will not come into it. A Congress appears\r\nto me to be of absolute Necessity, to settle the Dispute with\r\nGreat Britain if she by her violent and barbarous Treatment of\r\nus, should not totally quench our Affection for her, and render\r\nit impracticable. I hope no Hardships will ever induce America to\r\nsubmit to voluntary Slavery. I wish for Harmony between Britain &\r\nthe Colonies; but only upon the Principles of Equal Liberty.\r\n\r\nOur Assembly was unexpectedly adjournd on Saturday last till the\r\nseventh of June, then to meet at Salem. By this Means I am\r\nprevented mentioning a Congress to the Members. I wish your\r\nAssembly could find it convenient to sit a fornight longer, that\r\nwe might if possible act in Concert. This however is a sudden\r\nThought. I have written in the utmost haste, and conclude, with\r\ngreat Regard to the Gentlemen of the Committee.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour Friend & fellow Countryman,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CHECKLEY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON June 1 1774\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIt was with singular pleasure that I recd a Letter from you by Mr\r\nHowe, and another since by your worthy Townsman. I began to think\r\nyou had at last entirely forgot me. I sincerely congratulate you\r\non the birth of a Daughter. May God preserve her life & make her\r\na Blessing in the World. Assure Mrs Checkley of our kind Regards\r\nfor her. I hope she will enjoy a better State of Health than she\r\nhas had in time past. You have now devolvd upon you the weighty\r\nCares of a Parent; you will perhaps find it difficult \"to train\r\nup the Child in the way it should go\" in an Age of Levity Folly\r\nand Vice. Doubtless you will consider your self more interrested\r\nthan ever in the Struggles of your Country for Liberty, as you\r\nhope your Infant will outlive you, and share in the Event. Your\r\nnative Town which I am perswaded is dear to you, is now suffering\r\nthe Vengeance of a cruel and tyrannical Administration; and I can\r\nassure you she suffers with Dignity. She scorns to own herself\r\nthe Slave of the haughtiest nation on earth; and rather than\r\nsubmit to the humiliating Terms of an Edict, barbarous beyond\r\nPrecedent under the most absolute monarchy, I trust she will put\r\nthe Malice of Tyranny to the severest Tryal. It is a consolatory\r\nthought, that an Empire is rising in America, and will not THIS\r\nfirst of June be rememberd at a time, how soon God knows! when it\r\nwill be in the power of this Country amply to revenge its Wrongs.\r\nIf Britain by her multiplied oppressions is now accelerating that\r\nIndependency of the Colonies which she so much dreads, and which\r\nin process of time must take place, who will she have to blame\r\nbut herself? We live in an important Period, & have a post to\r\nmaintain, to desert which would be an unpardonable Crime, and\r\nwould entail upon us the Curses of posterity. The infamous Tools\r\nof Power are holding up the picture of Want and Misery; but in\r\nvain do they think to intimidate us; the Virtue of our Ancestors\r\ninspires us--they were contented with Clams & Muscles. For my\r\npart, I have been wont to converse with poverty; and however\r\ndisagreable a Companion she may be thought to be by the affluent\r\n& luxurious who never were acquainted with her, I can live\r\nhappily with her the remainder of my days, if I can thereby\r\ncontribute to the Redemption of my Country.\r\n\r\nThe naval Power of Britain has blocked up this Harbour; but the\r\nLaws of Nature must be alterd, before the port of Salem can\r\nbecome an equivalent. The most remote inland Towns in the\r\nprovince feel the want of a mart, & resent the Injury done to\r\nthemselves in the Destruction of Boston. The British Minister\r\nappears to me to be infatuated. Every step he takes seems designd\r\nby him to divide us, while the necessary Tendency is to unite.\r\nOur Business is to make Britain share in the miseries which she\r\nhas unrighteously brought upon us. She will then see the\r\nNecessity of returning to moderation & Justice.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 17 1774\r\n\r\nWhereas the Towns of Boston and Charlestown are at this time\r\nsuffering under the Hand of Power, by the shutting up the Harbour\r\nby an armed Force, which in the opinion of this House is an\r\nInvasion of the said Towns evidently designd to compel the\r\nInhabitants thereof to a Submission to Taxes imposed upon them\r\nwithout their Consent: And Whereas it appears to this House that\r\nthis Attack upon the said Towns for the Purpose aforesaid is an\r\nAttack made upon this whole Province & Continent which threatens\r\nthe total Destruction of the Liberties of all British America: It\r\nis therefore Resolvd as the clear opinion of this House, that the\r\nInhabitants of the said Towns ought to be relievd; and this House\r\ndo recommend to all, and more especially to [the] Inhabitants of\r\nthis Province to afford them speedy and constant Reliefe in such\r\nWay and Manner as shall be most suitable to their Circumstances\r\ntill the sense & advice of our Sister Colonies shall be known: In\r\nfull Confidence that they will exhibit Examples of Patience\r\nFortitude and Perseverance, while they are thus called to endure\r\nthis oppression, for the Preservation of the Liberties of their\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nAfter debate accepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 48, 49.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, June 22, 1774.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe committee of correspondence take this first opportunity to\r\nmake their most grateful aknowledgments of the generous and\r\npatriotic sympathy of our brethren, the worthy merchants and\r\ntraders of the town of Marblehead, as well those who have already\r\nsubscribed for our relief, as those who express their readiness\r\nto serve the trade of Boston. Our sense of their favour, as it\r\nrespects individuals, is strong and lively; but the honour and\r\nadvantage thereby derived to the common cause of our country, are\r\nso great and conspicuous, that private considerations of every\r\nkind recede before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, June 27, 1774.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nFrom an Extract of a Letter from a Southern Colony, and the\r\nPublications in last Thursday's Gazette, it is very evident a\r\nScheme has been concerted by some Persons to frustrate any\r\nAttempts that might be made to suspend our Trade with Great-\r\nBritain, till our most intolerable Grievances are redressed. The\r\nScheme appears to be, to SEEM to agree to the Suspension in Case\r\nall agreed, and then by construing some Passage in a Letter from\r\nthe Committee of another Province, that they had NOT AGREED, to\r\ndeclare that the conditional Signers were NOT HOLDEN. A GAME or\r\ntwo of such Mercantile Policy would soon have convinced the World\r\nthat Lord North had a just Idea of the Colonies; and that\r\nnotwithstanding their real Power to prove a Rope of Hemp to him,\r\nthey were a Rope of Sand in Reality, among themselves. I would\r\nbeg Leave to ask the voluminous Querists referr'd to. whether\r\nthey conceive a Non-consumption Agreement would ever have been\r\ntho't of in the Country, could our Brethren there have persuaded\r\nthemselves that the Merchants were in earnest to suspend Trade\r\nthe little Time there was between our receiving the Port Bill,\r\nand the Appointment of a Congress, or any other general Measure\r\ncome into, from which a radical Relief might be expected? 2.\r\nWhether the Trade in their last Meeting declaring, That their\r\nCONDITIONAL Agreement was DISSOLVED, on Pretence that Advices\r\nfrom New York and Philadelphia were totally discouraging, was not\r\nhighly unbecoming a People whose peculiar Circumstances rendered\r\nit their duty to stop their Trade to Great Britain the Moment the\r\nPort-Bill reached the Shore of America? 3. Whether they conceive\r\nthe Committee of Boston planned the Non-consumption Agreement,\r\nand sent it first into the Country for their Adoption? or rather,\r\nwhether the Country, enraged at their preposterous Management,\r\ndid not originate the Plan and press the Committee to have it\r\ndigested, printed and recommended throughout the Colony? 4. I\r\nwould enquire whether a Backwardness in the Province, actually\r\nsuffering, to come into the only peaceful Measure that remains\r\nfor our Extrication from Slavery, would not naturally excuse\r\nevery other Province from taking one Step for the common\r\nSalvation? 5. Whether in that Case all the Trade of the Province,\r\nwhether consisting of Spring, Summer or Fall Importations, would\r\nin the End be worth an Oyster-Shell? 6. Whether all the Bugbears\r\nstarted against the Worcester Covenant, as holding up the taking\r\na solemn Oath to \"withdraw all Commercial Connexions,\" which our\r\nhonest Commentators tell the People means even to deny buying or\r\nselling Greens or Potatoes to them, does not betray a great want\r\nof that Candor and manly Generosity, which is expected from well-\r\nbred and reasonble Citizens? 7. Whether the suggestion that the\r\nBoston Merchants ceasing to Import, will throw the Trade into the\r\nHands of Importers in other Provinces, is not utterly unbecoming\r\nan Inhabitant of that Town, into which the Beneficence of the\r\nwhole Continent is ready to flow in the most exemplary Manner?\r\nFor Shame! Self Interested Mortals, cease to draw upon your\r\nworthy Fellow Citizens the just Resentment of Millions. If there\r\nmay be Some Punctilios wrong in the Non-consumption Agreement,\r\nthe united Wisdom of the Continent will surely be capable of\r\nsetting Matters right at the general Congress; and no Gentleman\r\nTrader, be his Haste ever so great to get Rich, need distress\r\nhimself so mightily about the Profits of one Fall-Importation, if\r\nthe constant Clamour of the Trade for two Years past, that they\r\ndid Business for nothing, had any Foundation.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON June 30 1774\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nYour Letter by order of your Committee directed to Mr Cooper with\r\nthe inclosed Resolves came to my hand this day. I shall as soon\r\nas possible call a Committee of the Town who are appointed to\r\nconsider of Ways and Means for the Employment of the poor, and to\r\nappropriate and distribute such Donations as our generous friends\r\nshall make for the Reliefe of those Inhabitants who may be\r\ndeprivd of the Means of Subsistence by the Operation of the Port\r\nBill. This Committee consists of the standing Overseers of the\r\npoor who are to act in Concert with others who had been before\r\nappointed for the purposes above mentiond, as you will observe by\r\nthe inclosed Votes of the Town. The principal Reason assignd in\r\nthe Vote for joyning the Overseers is because by an Act of this\r\nprovince they are a corporate body empowerd to receive Monies &c\r\nfor the Use of the poor, but those Gentlemen have since informd\r\nthe others of the joynt Committee that they cannot consistently\r\nwith the Act of their Incoporation admit of any but their own\r\nBody in the Distribution of the Monies that may at any time come\r\ninto their hands for the Use of the poor. They are heartily\r\ndesirous of acting in Concert agreable to the Vote of the Town\r\nbut consider themselves as under Restraint by the Law. The Donors\r\nmay if they please consign their Donations to any one Gentleman\r\n(William Phillips Esqr) to be appropriated for the EMPLOYMENT or\r\nRELIEFE of such Inhabitants of the Town of Boston as may be\r\ndeprived of the Means of Subsistence by the Operation of the Act\r\nof Parliament commonly stiled the Boston Port Bill, at the best\r\nDiscretion of the Overseers of the poor of Boston joynd by a\r\nCommittee appointed by said Town to consider of Ways and Means\r\nfor the Employment of the poor.\r\n\r\nI have given my private Sentiment, and am with great Respect &\r\nGratitude to the Gentl of the City & County of Philadelphia,\r\n\r\nYour friend & fellow Countryman,1\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1In the interval before the date of the next letter an article\r\nsigned \"Candidus\" was published in the Massachusetts\r\nSpy, July 7, 1774.

Wells,\r\nand portions are printed in his Life of Samuel\r\nAdams, vol. ii., pp. 187,197.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF NORWICH.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON July 11 1774.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nYour obliging Letter directed to the Committee of Correspondence\r\nfor the Town of Boston came just now to my hand; and as the\r\nGentleman who brought it is in haste to return, I take the\r\nLiberty of writing you my own Sentiments in Answer, not doubting\r\nbut they are concurrent with those of my Brethren. I can venture\r\nto assure you that the valueable Donation of the worthy Town of\r\nNorwich will be receivd by this Community with the warmest\r\nGratitude and disposd of according to the true Intent of the\r\ngenerous Donors. The Liberality of the Sister Colonies will I\r\ntrust support & comfort the Inhabitants under the pressure of\r\nenormous Power, & enable them to endure affliction with that\r\nDignity which becomes those who are called to suffer in the Cause\r\nof Liberty & Truth. The Manner of transmitting the Donation will\r\nbe left to your Discretion; and that it may be conducted\r\naccording to the Inclination of the Town, I beg Leave to propose,\r\nthat it be directed to some one Gentleman (say William Phillips\r\nEsqr) to be disposd of for the Employment or Reliefe of such\r\nInhabitants of the Town of Boston as may become Sufferers by\r\nmeans of an Act of the British Parliament called the Boston Port\r\nbill, at the Discretion of the Overseers of the Poor of said Town\r\njoynd with a Committee appointed to consider of Ways & Means for\r\nthe Employmt of such Poor. The Part which the Town of Norwich\r\ntakes in this Struggle for American Liberty is truly noble; and\r\nthis Town rejoyces with you in the Harmony Moderation & Vigor\r\nwhich prevails throughout the united Colonies.\r\n\r\nYou may rely upon it that there is no Foundation for the Report\r\nthat the Opposition gains Ground upon us. The Emissaries of a\r\nParty which is now reduced to a very small Number of Men, a great\r\nPart of whom are in Reality Expectants from & in Connection with\r\nthe Revenue, are daily going out with such idle Stories; but\r\nwhoever reads the Accounts of the Proceedings of our Town\r\nMeetings, which I can assure you have been truly stated in the\r\nNews papers under the hand of the Town Clerk, will see that no\r\nCredit is due to such Reports.\r\n\r\nI shall lay your Letter before the Committee of Correspondence\r\nwho will write to you by the first opportunity. In the mean time\r\nI am in Sincerity\r\n\r\nYour obliged Friend &\r\nFellow Countryman,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Addressed to \"Jed Huntington, Chris Leffingwell, Theoph Rogers\r\nEsqrs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., American Philosophical Society1; a draft is in the Samuel\r\nAdams Papers, Lenox Library; an undated text is in R. H. Lee,\r\nLife of R. H. Lee, vol. i., pp. 99-101.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON July 15th 1774\r\n\r\nI have lately been favour'd with three Letters from you, and must\r\nbeg you to attribute my omitting to make a due Acknowledgment\r\ntill this Time, to a Multiplicity of Affairs to which I have been\r\noblig'd to give my constant Attention.\r\n\r\nThe unrighteous and oppressive Act of the British Parliament for\r\nshutting up this Harbour, although executed with a Rigour beyond\r\nthe Intent even of the Framers of it, has hitherto faild, and I\r\nbelieve will continue to fail of the Effect which the Enemies of\r\nAmerica flatter'd themselves it would have. The Inhabitants still\r\nwear chearful countenances. Far from being in the least Degree\r\nintimidated they are resolved to undergo the greatest Hardships,\r\nrather than Submit in any Instance to the Tyrannical Act. They\r\nare daily encouraged to persevere, by the Intelligence which they\r\nreceive from their Brethren not of this Province only, but of\r\nevery other Colony, that they are consider'd as suffering in the\r\ncommon Cause; and the Resolution of ALL, to support them in the\r\nConflict. Lord North had no Expectation that we should be thus\r\nSustained; on the Contrary he trusted that Boston would be left\r\nby all her Friends to Struggle and fall alone.--He has therefore\r\nmade no Preparation for the Effects of an Union. From the\r\nInformation I have had from Intelligent Persons in England, I\r\nverily believe the Design was to seize some Persons here, and\r\nsend them Home; but the Steadiness and Prudence of the People,\r\nand the unexpected Union of the Colonies, evidenc'd by liberal\r\nContributions for our Support, have disconcerted them; and they\r\nare at a loss how to proceed further. Four Regiments are now\r\nencamp'd on our Common, and more are expected; but I trust the\r\nPeople will, by a circumspect Behavior, prevent their taking\r\noccasion to Act. The Port Bill, is follow'd by two other Acts of\r\nthe British Parliament; the one for regulating the Government of\r\nthis Province, or rather totally to destroy our free Constitution\r\nand substitute an absolute Government in its Stead; the other for\r\nthe more IMPARTIAL Administration of Justice or as some term it\r\nfor the screening from Punishment any Soldier who shall Murder an\r\nAmerican for asserting his Right. A Submission to these Acts will\r\ndoubtless be requir'd and expected; but whether General Gage will\r\nfind it an easy thing to FORCE the People to submit to so great\r\nand fundamental a Change of Government, is a Question I think,\r\nworthy his Consideration--Will the People of America consider\r\nthese measures, as Attacks on the Constitution of an Individual\r\nProvince in which the rest are not interested; or will they view\r\nthe model of Government prepar'd for us as a Sistem for the whole\r\nContinent. Will they, as unconcern'd Spectators, look upon it to\r\nbe design'd only to top off the exuberant Branches of Democracy\r\nin the Constitution of this Province? Or, as part of a plan to\r\nreduce them all to Slavery? These are Questions, in my Opinion of\r\nImportance, which I trust will be thoroughly weighed in a general\r\nCongress.--May God inspire that intended Body with Wisdom and\r\nFortitude, and unite and Prosper their Councils!\r\n\r\nThe People of this Province are thoroughly Sensible of the\r\nNecessity of breaking off all Commercial Connection with the\r\nCountry, whose political Councils direct to Measures to enslave\r\nthem. They however THE BODY of the Nation, are being kept in\r\nprofound Ignorance of the Nature of the Dispute between Britain\r\nand the Colonies; and taught to believe that we are a perfidious\r\n& rebellious People.\r\n\r\nIt is with Reluctance that they come into any Resolutions, which\r\nmust distress those who are not the objects of their Resentment\r\nbut they are urg'd to it from Motives of Self-preservation, and\r\ntherefore are signing an agreement in the several Towns, not to\r\nconsume any British Goods which shall be imported after the last\r\nof August next; and that they may not be impos'd upon, they are\r\nto require an Oath of those from whom they shall hereafter\r\npurchase such Goods. It is the Virtue of the Yeomanry that we are\r\nchiefly to depend upon. Our Friends in Maryland talk of\r\nwithholding the Exportation of Tobacco; this was first hinted to\r\nus by the Gentlemen of the late House of Burgesses of Virginia\r\nwho had been called together after the Dissolution of your\r\nAssembly--This would be a Measure greatly interesting to the\r\nMother Country.\r\n\r\nShould America hold up her own Importance to the Body of the\r\nNation and at the same Time agree in one general Bill of Rights,\r\nthe Dispute might be settled on the Principles of Equity and\r\nHarmony restored between Britain and the Colonies.\r\n\r\nI am with great Regard\r\nYour Friend & Fellow Countryman,\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\n1In this instance the body of the letter actually sent, from\r\nwhich this text is taken, is not in the autograph of\r\nAdams, only the subscription, signature, and address being in his\r\nhand.

Permit me to add Gentlemen that the\r\nCommittee of Correspondence for the Town of Boston at whose\r\nRequest I now write, set too high a Value upon your Advice and\r\nesteem a general Union of too great Importance, to neglect any\r\nSteps at this alarming Crisis, which may have a Tendency to\r\neffect so desirable a Purpose.\r\n\r\nThey have this additional Motive to invite all the Colonies into\r\none firm Band of Opposition to the oppressive Measures of the\r\nBritish Administration, that they look upon this Town as\r\nconflicting for all. The Danger is general; and should we succumb\r\nunder the heavy Rod now hanging over us, we might be esteemd the\r\nbase Betrayers of the Common Interest.\r\n\r\nWe are informd that the Infant Colony of West Florida has\r\ncontended for the Right on an annual Choice of Representatives.

It cannot but afford Pleasure to an observing\r\nAmerican to find, that the British Administration, by every\r\nMeasure they take for the Suppression of the Spirit of Liberty in\r\nthe Colonies, have promoted, till they have at length established\r\na perfect Union; which, if it continues, must effect the\r\nDestruction of their cursed Plans of arbitrary Power.--The Boston\r\nPort bill is a parliamentary Punishment of this People, designd,\r\nas Lord North expressd himself, to convince America that they are\r\nin earnest.--What will his Lordship think, when he finds, that\r\nhis \"spirited Measures\" have not the designd Effect, wch was to\r\nintimidate us--that America is also IN EARNEST and the whole\r\nContinent united in an effectual Measure, which they have always\r\nin their Power to adopt, to distress the Trade of Britain, &\r\nthereby bring her to her Senses. The Premier little thought of\r\nthis united Resentment, and therefore has made no Preparation\r\nagainst the Effects of it. He promisd himself that the . . . ,\r\nand leave her to fall under the Scourge of ministerial Vengeance.\r\nThe noble and generous Part which all are taking & particularly\r\nSouth Carolina on this Occasion must convince him that the\r\nBritish Brothers, each of whom resents an Attack upon the Rights\r\nof one as an Attack upon the Rights of all. The Port bill is\r\nfollowed by two others; One for cutting the Charter of this\r\nProvince into Shivers, and the other to encourage Murderers by\r\nskreening them from Punishment. What short Work these modern\r\nPoliticians make with solemn Compacts founded on the Faith of\r\nKings! The Minds of this People can never be reconciled to so\r\nfundamental a Change of their civil Constitution; and I should\r\nthink that General Gage, allowing that he has but a small Share\r\nof Prudence, will hardly think of risqueing the horrible Effects\r\nof civil War, by suddenly attempting to force the Establishmt of\r\na Plan of civil Government which must be shocking to all the\r\nother Colonies even in the Contemplation of it; but the more so,\r\nas they must consider themselves to be deeply interrested in the\r\nAttempt.--I pray God that he may not wantonly exercise the\r\nexorbitant Power intended to be, if not already, put into his\r\nHands.--If the Wrath of Man is a little while restraind, it is\r\npossible that the united Wisdom of the Colonists, may devise\r\nMeans in a peaceable Way, not only for the Restoration of their\r\nown Rights and Liberties, but the Establishment of Harmony with\r\nGreat Britain, which certainly must be the earnest Desire of Wise\r\nand good Men. I am\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,t,\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf., Vol. i., page 108. [back]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHRISTOPHER GADSDEN AND L.

So very generous a Donation of twenty Gentlemen only of\r\nthe Town of Charlestown, towards the Reliefe of the Sufferers by\r\nthe cruel & oppressive Port bill, demands our most grateful\r\nAcknowledgments; and the Assurances you give us of the kind\r\nDisposition of our worthy Friends in South Carolina towards the\r\nInhabitants of this Town will, we are perswaded, greatly\r\nencourage them to bear up under that oppressive Ministerial\r\nVengeance which they are now called to endure for the common\r\nCause of America. Supported as we are by our Brethren in all the\r\nColonies, we must be ungrateful to them as well as lost to the\r\nfeelings of publick Virtue should we comply with the Demands to\r\nsurrender the Liberty of America. We think you may rely upon it\r\nthat the People of [this] Province in general will joyn in any\r\nproper M[easures] that may be proposed for the restoration &\r\nEstablishment of the Rights of America, and of that Harmony with\r\nthe Mother Country upon the principles of equal Liberty so much\r\ndesired by all wise & good Men. A Non Importation of British\r\nGoods is (with a few Exceptions) universally thought a salutary\r\nand an efficatious Measure; and in order to effectuate such\r\na Measure the yeomanry in the Country (upon whom under God we are\r\nto depend) are signing agreements to restrict themselves from\r\npurchasing & consuming them. We applaud and at the same time\r\n[are] animated by the patriotick Spirit of our Sister Colonies.\r\nSuch an union we believe was little expected by Lord North and we\r\nhave Reason to hope therefore that he has not thought of making\r\nany Preparation against the Effects of it. The Resolution &\r\nMagnanimity of the Colonists and the Firmness Perseverance &\r\nPrudence of the People of this insulted Town astonishes our\r\nAdversaries, & we trust will put them to a Loss how to proceed\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nWe shall dispose of the valueable Donation as you direct, in such\r\nManner as we shall judge most conducible to the Intention of the\r\ngenerous Donors, to whom be pleasd to present our kind Regards\r\nand be assured we are Gentlemen their and your sincere & obliged\r\nFriends and\r\n\r\nFellow Countrymen,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO THE COMMITTEE OF\r\nCORRESPONDENCE OF COLRAIN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON July 18 1774\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN/\r\n\r\nWe receivd your favor by the hand of Mr Wood, and observe the Art\r\nof the Tories in your part of the Province to make the People\r\nbelieve the Non Consumption Agreement is a Trick of the Merchants\r\nof this Town, that they may have the Advantage of selling off the\r\nGoods they have on hand at an exorbitant Rate. So far is this\r\nfrom the Truth, that the Merchants importing Goods from England,\r\na few excepted, were totally against the Covenant. They complaind\r\nof it in our Town Meeting as a Measure destructive to their\r\nInterest. Some of them have protested against it as such; and\r\nthey are now using their utmost Endeavors to prevent it. Can it\r\nthen be rationally said by the Advocates for Tyranny that it is a\r\nPlan laid by the Merchants? The Enemies of our Constitution know\r\nfull well that if there are no Purchasers of British Goodsc there\r\nwill be no Importers. On the Contrary if the People in the\r\nCountry will purchase there are People in the City avaricious\r\nenough to import. Hence it is that they are so agitated with the\r\nNon Consumption Agreement that they will not hesitate at any rate\r\nto discredit it.\r\n\r\nWe highly applaud your Zeal for the Liberties of your Country and\r\nare with great Regard\r\n\r\nYour friends & fellow Countrymen,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ANDREW ELTON WELLS.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON July 25 1774\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BROTHER\r\n\r\nI beg you to believe me when I tell you that incessant publick\r\nBusiness has prevented my writing to you as often as my own\r\nInclination would lead me to do it.

But she prides herself in being calld to suffer for the\r\nCause of American Freedom and rises superior to her proud\r\noppressors, she suffers with Dignity; and while we are enduring\r\nthe hard Conflict, it is a Consolation to us that thousands of\r\nlittle Americans who cannot at present distinguish between the\r\nRight hand & the left, will reap the happy Fruits of it; and\r\namong these I bear particularly in my mind my young Cousins of\r\nyour Family.\r\n\r\nFour Regiments are encampd upon our Common, while the Harbour is\r\nblockd up by Ships of War. Nothing is sufferd to be waterborn in\r\nthe Harbour excepting the Wood and Provisions brot in to keep us\r\nfrom actually perishing. By such Oppressions the British\r\nAdministration hope to suppress the Spirit of Liberty in this\r\nplace; but being encouragd by the generous Supplys that are daily\r\nSent to us the Inhabitants are determind to hold out and appeal\r\nto the Justice of the Colonies & of the World--trusting in God\r\nthat these things shall be overruled for the Establishment of\r\nLiberty Virtue & Happiness in America--Your Sister is in\r\ntollerable Health and together with my Son & Daughter send their\r\naffectionate respects to your self Mrs Wells & your family--I am\r\nsincerely\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf., Vol. II., page 337.

They had before received one barrel of\r\nolive oil. Mr. Gatchel delivered them L 39 Is. 3d. in cash, and\r\nthis day the fish in eleven carts, and the remainder of the oil\r\ncame to hand. I am desired by that Committee to express their\r\nwarmest gratitude to the Gentlemen of Marblehead, who have so\r\nliberally contributed on this occasion, and to assure them that\r\nit will be applied in a manner agreeable to the intention of the\r\ncharitable donors.\r\n\r\nIt was in all probability the expectation of Lord North, the\r\nsister Colonies would totally disregard the fate of Boston, and\r\nthat she would be left to suffer and fall alone. Their united\r\nresolution, therefore, to support her in the conflict, will, it\r\nis hoped, greatly perplex him in the further prosecution of his\r\noppressive measures, and finally reduce him to the necessity of\r\nreceding from them. While we are thus aided by our brethren, you\r\nmay depend upon it that we shall not disgrace the common cause of\r\nAmerica, by any submissions to the barbarous edict. Our\r\ninhabitants still wear cheerful countenances, and they WILL be\r\nsupported by the beneficence of our friends, notwithstanding one\r\nof your addressers meanly insinuated to a gentleman of South\r\nCarolina, at Salem, yesterday, that they would receive no benefit\r\nfrom the large donation of rice received from that place. Such an\r\nintimation discovers a degree of depravity of heart which cannot\r\neasily be expressed. I have received a letter from your\r\n[Committee] to our Committee of Correspondence, which I shall lay\r\nbefore them at their meeting this evening.\r\n\r\nI am, in behalf of the Committee of Donations, Gentlemen, your\r\nfriend and\r\n\r\nfellow-countryman,\r\n\r\nP.

The Congress is resolved\r\ninto Committees and Sub-Committees and all seem fully sensible of\r\nthe intollerable Grievances which the Colonies are struggling\r\nunder, and determined to procure effectual redress. The Subject\r\nMatter of their Debates I am restraind upon Honor from disclosing\r\nat present; but I may assure you that the Sentiments of the\r\nCongress hitherto discoverd and the Business assignd to the\r\nseveral Committees are such as perfectly coincide with your\r\nExpectations.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of our Countrymen does them great Honor--Our Brethren\r\nof the County of Middlesex have resolvd nobly, and their\r\nresolutions1 are read by the several Members of this Body with\r\nhigh Applause.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that an opposition to the new Mode of\r\nGovernment ought to be maintaind. A warm Advocate for the Cause\r\nof Liberty to whom America is much obligd for his former Labors\r\ntold me that he was fully of Opinion that no officer under the\r\nnew Establishment ought to be acknowledgd; on the other hand that\r\neach of them should be warned against exercising any Authority\r\nupon pain of the UTMOST Resentment of the people. It is therefore\r\ngreatly to his Satisfaction to observe the Measures that have\r\nbeen taken. I am pleasd to hear that a provincial Congress is\r\nproposd, and cannot but promise my self that the firm manly and\r\npersevering Opposition of that single province will operate to\r\nthe total frustration of the villainous Designs of our Tyrants\r\nand their Destruction.\r\n\r\nI hope the Committee will continue to act up to their Dignity and\r\nImportance.--I am yet of Opinion that Heaven will honor them with\r\na great Share of the Merit of saving the Rights of all America.\r\nMay God inspire them with Wisdom & Fortitude. I must beg them to\r\nexcuse this hasty Effusion of an honest heart, having been just\r\nnow (while in a Committee) informd that a Vessell is immediately\r\nabout to sail to Marblehead. Pray let me hear from the Committee-\r\n-being as you all know A MAN OF FORTUNE, you need not fear\r\nputting me to the Expence of postage--direct to Mr Saml Smith and\r\nSons Merchts in this City.

Our friend, Mr. Quincy, informed me before\r\nI left Boston, of his intention to take passage for England. I am\r\npersuaded he may do great service to our country there. Agreeably\r\nto his and your requests, I have desired gentlemen here to make\r\nhim known to their friends and correspondents.\r\n\r\nLast Friday Mr. Revere brought us the spirited and patriotick\r\nResolves of your County ofSuffolk.2 We laid them before the\r\nCongress. They were read with great applause, and the Enclosed\r\nResolutions were unanimously passed, which give you a faint idea\r\nof the spirit of the Congress. I think I may assure you that\r\nAmerica will make a point of supporting Boston to the utmost. I\r\nhave not time to enlarge, and must therefore conclude with\r\nassuring you that I am, with great] regard, your affectionate and\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1The date is given as September 18 in Frothingham, Life and Times\r\nof Joseph Warren, p. 367.\r\n2Journals of each Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, pp. 601-\r\n609.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH WARREN.\r\n\r\n[R. Frothingham, Life and Times of Joseph Warren, p. 377; a draft\r\nis in the Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, September, 1774.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 12th instant, directed to Mr. Cushing and\r\nothers, came duly to hand. The subject of it is of great\r\nimportance. It is difficult, at this distance, to form a\r\njudgment, with any degree of accuracy, of what is best to be\r\ndone. The eastern and western counties appear to differ in\r\nsentiment with regard to the two measures mentioned in your\r\nletter. This difference of sentiment might produce opposition, in\r\ncase either part should be taken. You know the vast importance of\r\nunion. That union is most likely to be obtained by a consultation\r\nof deputies from the several towns, either in a House of\r\nRepresentatives or a Provincial Congress. But the question still\r\nremains, which measure to adopt. It is probable that the people\r\nwould be most united, as they would think it safest, to abide by\r\nthe present form of government,--I mean according to the charter.\r\nThe governor has been appointed by the Crown, according to the\r\ncharter; but he has placed himself at the head of a different\r\nconstitution. If the only constitutional council, chosen last\r\nMay, have honesty and courage enough to meet with the\r\nrepresentatives chosen by the people by virtue of the last writ,\r\nand jointly proceed to the public business, would it not bring\r\nthe governor to such an explicit conduct as either to restore the\r\ngeneral assembly, or give the two Houses a fair occasion to\r\ndeclare the chair vacant? In which case the council would hold it\r\ntill another governor should be appointed. This would immediately\r\nreduce the government prescribed in the charter; and the people\r\nwould be united in what they would easily see to be a\r\nconstitutional opposition to tyranny. You know there is a charm\r\nin the word \"constitutional.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH WARREN.\r\n\r\n[R. Frothingham, Life and Times of Joseph Warren, pp. 377, 378; a\r\ndraft is in the Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, September 25, 1774.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I wrote you yesterday by the post. A frequent\r\ncommunication at this critical conjuncture is necessary. As the\r\nall-important American cause so much depends upon each colony's\r\nacting agreeably to the sentiments of the whole, it must be\r\nuseful to you to know the sentiments which are entertained here\r\nof the temper and conduct of our province. Heretofore we have\r\nbeen accounted by many, intemperate and rash; but now we are\r\nuniversally applauded as cool and judicious, as well as spirited\r\nand brave. This is the character we sustain in congress. There\r\nis, however, a certain degree of jealousy in the minds of some,\r\nthat we aim at a total independency, not only of the mother-\r\ncountry, but of the colonies too; and that, as we are a hardy and\r\nbrave people, we shall in time overrun them all. However\r\ngroundless this jealousy may be, it ought to be attended to, and\r\nis of weight in your deliberations on the subject of your last\r\nletter. I spent yesterday afternoon and evening with Mr\r\nDickinson. He is a true Bostonian. It is his opinion, that, if\r\nBoston can safely remain on the defensive, the liberties of\r\nAmerica, which that town has so nobly contended for, will be\r\nsecured. The congress have, in their resolve of the 17th instant,\r\ngiven their sanction to the resolutions of the county of Suffolk,\r\none of which is to act merely on the defensive, so long as such\r\nconduct may be justified by reason and the principles of self-\r\npreservation, but NO LONGER. They have great dependence upon your\r\ntried patience and fortitude. They suppose you mean to defend\r\nyour civil constitution. They strongly recommend perseverance in\r\na firm and temperate conduct, and give you a full pledge of their\r\nunited efforts in your behalf. They have not yet come to final\r\nresolutions. It becomes them to be deliberate. I have been\r\nassured, in private conversation with individuals, that, if you\r\nshould be driven to the necessity of acting in the defence of\r\nyour lives or liberty, you would be justified by their\r\nconstituents, and openly supported by all the means in their\r\npower; but whether they will ever be prevailed upon to think it\r\nnecessary for you to set up another form of government, I very\r\nmuch question, for the reason I have before suggested. It is of\r\nthe greatest importance, that the American opposition should be\r\nunited, and that it should be conducted so as to concur with the\r\nopposition of our friends in England. Adieu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS TO GENERAL GAGE.1 [OCTOBER, 1774.]\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GAGE.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThe Delegates from his Majestys several Colonies of New Hampshire\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * assembled in general Congress in the City\r\nof Philadelphia take the Liberty of addressing you upon Subjects\r\nof the last Importance, to your own Character, Happiness and\r\nPeace of Mind, to his Majestys Service, to the Wellfare of that\r\nProvince over which you preside and of all North America, and,\r\nperhaps, of the whole British Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Act of the British Parliament for shutting up the Harbour of\r\nBoston is universally deemd to be unjust and cruel; and the World\r\nnow sees with Astonishment & Indignation the Distress which the\r\nInhabitants of that loyal though devoted Town are suffering under\r\nthe most rigid Execution of it.\r\n\r\nThere are two other Acts passed in the present Session of\r\nParliament, the one for regulating the Government of the Province\r\nof Massachusetts Bay and the other entitled an Act for the more\r\nimpartial Administration of Justice in the same Province; the\r\nformer of these Acts was made with the professed Purpose of\r\nmaterially altering the Charter of that Province granted by his\r\nMajesties Royal Predecessors King William & Queen Mary for\r\nthemselves their Heirs &c forever; and both or either of them if\r\nput into Execution will shake the Foundations of that free &\r\nhappy Constitution which is the Birthright of English Subjects,\r\nand totally destroy the inestimable Blessing of Security in Life\r\nLiberty and Property.\r\n\r\nBy your own Acknowledgment, the refusal of the People to yield\r\nobedience to these Acts is far from being confind to a Faction in\r\nthe Town of Boston. It is general through the province. And we do\r\nnow assure your Excellency, that this Refusal is vindicable, in\r\nthe opinion of this Congress, by the Laws of Reason and Self\r\npreservation; and the People ought to be and will be supported in\r\nit by the united Voice and Efforts of all America.\r\n\r\nWe are fully convinced that the Town of Boston and Province of\r\nthe Massachusetts Bay are suffering in the righteous Cause of\r\nAmerica, while they are nobly exerting themselves in the most\r\nspirited opposition to those oppressive Acts of Parliament and\r\nMeasures of Administration which are calculated to annihilate our\r\nmost sacred & invalueable Rights.\r\n\r\nIt is with the deepest Concern that we observe, that while this\r\nCongress are deliberating on the most effectual Measures for the\r\nrestoration of American Liberty and a happy Harmony between the\r\nColonies and the parent State, so essentially necessary to both,\r\nyour Excellency is erecting Fortifications round the Town of\r\nBoston, whereby well grounded Jealousies are excited in the Minds\r\nof his Majesties faithful Subjects and apprehensions that all\r\nCommunication between the Town & the Country will be cut off,\r\nor that this Freedom will be enjoyed at the Will of an Army.\r\n\r\nMoreover we would express to your Excellency the just Resentment\r\nwhich we feel at the Indignities offerd to our worthy fellow\r\nCitizens in Boston and the frequent Violations of private\r\nproperty by the Soldiers under your Command. These Enormities\r\ncommitted by a standing Army, in our opinion, unlawfully posted\r\nthere in a time of Peace, are irritating in the greatest Degree,\r\nand if not remedied, will endanger the involving all America in\r\nthe Horrors of a civil War! Your Situation Sir is extremely\r\ncritical. A rupture between the Inhabitants of the Province over\r\nwhich you preside and the Troops under your Command would produce\r\nConsequences of the most serious Nature: A Wound which would\r\nnever be heald! It would probably establish Animosities between\r\nGreat Britain & the Colonies which time would never eradicate! In\r\norder therefore to quiet the Minds & remove the Jealousies of the\r\npeople, that they may not be driven to such a State of\r\nDesperation as to quit the Town & fly for Shelter to their\r\nFriends and Countrymen, we intreat you from the Assurance we have\r\nof the peaceable Disposition of the Inhabitants to desist from\r\nfurther fortifications of the Town, and to give orders that a\r\nfree & safe Communication between them & the country may be\r\nrestored & continued.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Endorsed: \"This was offered to the Comittee of Congress to be\r\nreported as a Remonstrance to Genl Gage.\" On October 6, 1774,\r\nAdams, Lynch and Pendleton were appointed a committee to draft a\r\nletter to General Gage.

The Affidavit inclosd\r\nconfirms the report in Boston about the beginning of July, of a\r\nMans being seizd by the Soldiery, put under Guard & finally sent\r\nto England. But what Remedy can the poor injurd Fellow obtain in\r\nhis own Country where INTER ARMA SILENT LEGES! I have written to\r\nour Friends to provide themselves without Delay with Arms &\r\nAmmunition, get well instructed in the military Art, embody\r\nthemselves & prepare a complete Set of Rules that they may be\r\nready in Case they are called to defend themselves against the\r\nviolent Attacks of Despotism. Surely the Laws of Self\r\nPreservation will warrant it in this Time of Danger & doubtful\r\nExpectation. One cannot be certain that a distracted Minister\r\nwill yield to the Measures taken by the Congress, though they\r\nshould operate the Ruin of the National Trade, until he shall\r\nhave made further Efforts to lay America, as he impiously\r\nexpressd it \"prostrate at his Feet.\"\r\n\r\nI believe you will have seen before this reaches you, some\r\nfurther Resolves of the Congress relative to my native Town &\r\nProvince together with a Letter to Gage. They were sent to the\r\nCome of Correspondence in Boston by Mr Revere who left us a Week\r\nago, and I suppose are or will be publishd in the papers--you\r\nwill therein see the sense of the Gentlemen here of the Conduct\r\nof the General and the \"dignified Scoundrels,\" and of the\r\nopposition made to the tyrannical Acts. I think our Countrymen\r\ndiscover the Spirit of Rome or Sparta. I admire in them that\r\nPatience which you have often heard one say is characteristick of\r\nthe Patriot. I regretted your Removal from Boston when you first\r\ninformd me of it, but I trust it will be for the publick\r\nAdvantage.

The report is, that \"each\r\nMember of the Committee is allowed six shillings, and, as some\r\nsay, half a guinea, for every day's attendance; besides a\r\ncommission upon all the donations received, and other emoluments\r\nfor their trouble.\" The Committee, therefore, thus openly\r\ndeclare, that the above mentioned report is in every part of it\r\ngroundless and false ; and that they have hitherto attended and\r\nacted in their office, and still continue so to do, without any\r\nintention, hope, or desire, of receiving any other reward in this\r\nlife, but the pleasure which results from a consciousness of\r\nhaving done good.--So satisfied are they of their own\r\nDISINTERESTED motives and conduct in this regard, that they can\r\nsafely appeal to the Omniscient Being for their sincerity in this\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the committee have this evening been informed, by a\r\nletter from the country, of another report equally injurious,\r\nviz. that \"the Com- mittee have employed poor persons in working\r\nfor themselves, and gentlemen of fortune with whom they are\r\nparticularly connected in their private concerns, and paid them\r\nout of the donations received \"; the Committee do, with the same\r\nsolemnity, declare the said report to be as false as it is\r\nscandalous.\r\n\r\nThey were early apprehensive that the enemies of TRUTH and\r\nLIBERTY, would spare no pains to misrepresent their conduct and\r\nasperse their characters ; and therefore, that they might always\r\nhave it in their power to vindicate themselves, they have\r\nconstantly kept regular books, containing records of the whole of\r\ntheir proceedings; which books, as the Committee advertised the\r\npublic some months ago, are open for the inspection of such as\r\nare inclined to look into and examine them.\r\n\r\nThe Committee now challenge any person whatever, to make it\r\nappear, that there is a just foundation for such reports. Until\r\nthis reasonable demand is complied with, they confide in the\r\njustice of the public, that no credit will be given to reports,\r\nso injurious to the Committee, and to this oppressed and insulted\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIf the friends of truth will inform the Committee of any reports\r\nthey may hear, tending to defame the Committee, and by that means\r\nto discourage further donations for the benevolent purpose of\r\nrelieving the sufferers above-mentioned, it will be acknowledged\r\nas a particular favor.\r\n\r\nSign'd by Order of the Committee,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1 Signed by Samuel Adams as chairman.

I beg you\r\nwould attribute my not having acknowledgd the favor before this\r\ntime, to continual Avocations which the Necessity of the Times\r\nhave required.\r\n\r\nWhen the cruel Edict for shutting up this Harbour took place,\r\nwhich was in a very short time after we had any notice that such\r\na Measure was intended, the Inhabitants of the Town met in\r\nFaneuil Hall and, as you have long ago heard, resolvd to suffer\r\nall the hardships intended by it, rather than submit to its\r\nunrighteous as well as ignominious Terms. Supported by the most\r\nliberal Donations from their Brethren in all the Colonies, they\r\nsuffer the Suspension of their Trade & Business with Patience and\r\neven laugh at this feeble Effort of their Enemies to force them\r\nto make the Concessions of Slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Act for regulating the Government of this Province and the\r\nMurder Act as it is commonly called soon followd the Port Act;\r\nand General Gage, whether from his own Motives or the\r\nInstructions of the Minister, thought proper to assemble all the\r\nKings Troops then on the Continent, in this Town and has declared\r\nto the Selectmen & others his Resolution to put the Acts in\r\nExecution. The People on the other hand resolve that they will\r\nnot submit to them and the Continent applauds them herein. The\r\nnew appointed Councellors and others who have openly avowd the\r\nMeasures of Administration being conscious that Mr Gage was not\r\nmistaken when he publickly declared under his Hand, that the\r\nOpposition to these Acts was general through the Province, have\r\nfled to this Town for Protection. Thus we appear to be in a state\r\nof Hostility. The General with . . . Regiments with a very few\r\nAdherents on one side & all the rest of the Inhabitants of the\r\nProvince backd by all the Colonies on the other! The People are\r\nuniversally disposd to wait till they can hear what Effect the\r\nApplications of the Continental Congress will have, in hopes that\r\nthe new Parliament will reverse the Laws & measures of the old,\r\nabolish that System of Tyranny which was pland in 1763 (perhaps\r\nbefore), confirm the just Rights of the Colonies and restore\r\nHarmony to the British Empire. God grant they may not be\r\ndisappointed! Lest they should be, they have been, & are still\r\nexercising themselves in military Discipline and providing the\r\nnecessary Means of Defence. I am well informd that in every Part\r\nof the Province there are selected Numbers of Men, called Minute\r\nMen--that they are well disciplind & well provided--and that upon\r\na very short Notice they will be able to assemble a formidable\r\nArmy. They are resolvd however not to be the Aggressors in an\r\nopen Quarrel with the Troops; but animated with an unquenchable\r\nLove of Liberty they will support their righteous Claim to it, to\r\nthe utmost Extremity. They are filled with Indignation to hear\r\nthat Hutchinson & their other inveterate Enemies have hinted to\r\nthe Nation that they are Cowards. Administration may improve this\r\nSuggestion to promote their mad purposes, but whenever it is\r\nbrought to the Test it will be found to be a fatal Delusion. The\r\nPeople are recollecting the Achievements of their Ancestors and\r\nwhenever it shall be necessary for them to draw their Swords in\r\nthe Defence of their Liberties, they will shew themselves to be\r\nworthy of such Ancestors. I earnestly wish that Lord North would\r\nno longer listen to the Voice of Faction. Interested Men whose\r\nvery Being depends upon the Emoluments derivd to them from the\r\nAmerican Revenue, have been artfully deceiving him. Such Men as\r\nthese, some of them, under a mere pretence of flying to the Army\r\nfor Protection, have got themselves about General Gage. They are\r\nsupposd to be perpetually filling his Ears with gross\r\nMisrepresentations. Hutchinson who is now in England has the\r\nTongue & the Heart of a Courtier. His Letters to Whately show\r\nwhat his Designs have been and how much he has contributed\r\ntowards bringing on the present Difficulties. America never will,\r\nBritain never ought to forgive him. I know, at least I thought I\r\nknew his ambitious and avaritious Designs long before he wrote\r\nthose Letters. I know the part he bore in the several\r\nAdministrations of Shirly of Pownal & of Bernard. Pownals Views\r\nwere generous. I pitied him under his Embarrassments. Even\r\nBernard I can forgive. If Administration are determind still to\r\nform their measures from the Information of an inveterate Party,\r\nthey must look to the Consequences. It will be in vain for others\r\nto attempt to undeceive them. If they are disposd to bring\r\nMatters to an Accommodation they know the Sense of the Colonies\r\nby the Measures of the Continental Congress. If our Claims are\r\njust & reasonable they ought to concede to them. To pretend that\r\nit is beneath the Dignity of the Nation for them to do that which\r\nJustice demands of them is worse than Folly. Let them repeal\r\nevery American revenue Law--recall standing Armies--restore. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN COLLINS.\r\n\r\n[Historical Magazine, 2nd ser., vol. iv., p. 219.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Jany 31 1775\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI received your kind letter some time ago, which should have been\r\nacknowledged before this time but I beg you would consider that\r\nour hands are full. Our \"worthy citizen\" Mr Paul Revere will\r\nexplain to you the intelligence which we have just received from\r\nEngland.

God grant that we may not be brought to extremity\r\nor otherwise prepare us for all events.\r\n\r\nMr Tudor has informed me that a report has prevailed in\r\nPhiladelphia of a Fracas between Mr Cushing and myself at our\r\nlate Provincial Congress, he showed me your letter; you may\r\ndepend upon it there is not the least Foundation for the Report.\r\nAny Difference between Mr Cushing and me is of very little\r\nconsequence to the public cause. I take notice of it only as one\r\nof the many Falshoods which I know to have been propagated by the\r\nEnemies of America. It is also a Misrepresentation that the sect\r\ntaken notice of for opening their Shops on our late Thanksgiving\r\nDay, was that of the People called Quaquers. They were the\r\nDisciples of the late Mr Sanderman, who worship God here without\r\nthe least Molestation according to their own manner, and are in\r\nno other Light disregarded here but as it is said they are in\r\ngeneral avowed Friends of the Ministerial Measures. This is what\r\nI am told, for my own part I know but little or nothing about\r\nthem. The Different denominations of Christians here (excepting\r\nthose amongst them who Espouse the cause of our Enemies) are in\r\nperfect peace and Harmony, as I trust they always will be.\r\n\r\nI have written this letter in very great Haste, while in the\r\nCommittee of Correspondence and conclude with due Regard to your\r\nSpouse, and all friends\r\n\r\nYours affectionately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD ARCHER AND OTHERS.1\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 161, 162.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Feb. 1, 1775.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nThe Committee appointed to receive and distribute the donations\r\nmade for the relief and employment of the sufferers by the Port\r\nBill, have received your letter of the 6th December last,\r\ninclosing a bill of lading for seven hundred and fifteen bushels\r\ncorn, thirty-three barrels pork, fifty-eight barrels bread, and\r\nten barrels flour. We are sorry to inform you that the vessel was\r\ncast away, but being timely advised of the disaster by Capt.\r\nRysam, we have, though not without considerable expense, the good\r\nfortune of saving the most part of the cargo.\r\n\r\nThe County and Borough of Norfolk, and Town of Portsmouth, who\r\nmade this charitable donation for the sufferers above mentioned,\r\nhave the due acknowledgments of this Committee, and their hearty\r\nthanks, with assurance that it shall be applied agreeable to the\r\nbenevolent design. The cheerful accession of the gentlemen of\r\nVirginia to the measures proposed by the late Continental\r\nCongress, is an instance of that zeal for, and attachment to the\r\ncause of America, in which that colony has ever distinguished\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThis Town is suffering the severest strokes of ministerial\r\nvengeance, for their adherence to the same virtuous cause; and\r\nwhile the sister Colonies are testifying their approbation of its\r\nconduct, and so liberally contributing for its support, we trust\r\nthe inhabitants will continue to bear their suffering with a\r\nmanly fortitude, and preserve a superiority over their insulting\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nI am, in the name of the Committee, Gentlemen, your sincere\r\nfriend and fellow-countryman,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1A committee for the county and borough of Norfolk and town of\r\nPortsmouth, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD RANDOLPH.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 185, 186.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, February 1, 1775.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 29th December last, directed to Mr. Cushing,\r\nMr. John Adams, Mr. Paine and myself, inclosing bill of lading\r\nfor three hundred twenty-nine and a half bushels wheat, one\r\nhundred thirty-five bushels corn, and twenty-three barrels flour,\r\nwas delivered to us by Capt.

I am, in the name of the Committee, to desire you\r\nto return their hearty thanks to the worthy gentlemen of Henrico\r\nCounty, who have so generously contributed for that charitable\r\npurpose, and to assure them, that their donations shall be\r\napplied so as duly to answer their benevolent intention.\r\n\r\nThe Colony of Virginia made an early stand, by their ever\r\nmemorable Resolves, in 1765, against the efforts of a corrupt\r\nBritish Administration to enslave America, and has ever\r\ndistinguished herself by her exertions in support of our common\r\nrights. The sister Colonies struggled separately, but the\r\nMinister himself has at length united them, and they have lately\r\nuttered language that will be heard. It is the fate of this\r\nTown to drink deep of the cup of ministerial vengeance; but while\r\nAmerica bears them witness that they suffer in HER cause, they\r\nglory in their sufferings. Being thus supported by HER\r\nliberality, they will never ungratefully betray her rights.\r\nInheriting the spirit of their virtuous ancestors, they will,\r\nafter their example, endure hardships, and confide in an all-\r\ngracious Providence. Having been born to be free, they will never\r\ndisgrace themselves by a mean submission to the injurious terms\r\nof slavery. These, Sir, I verily believe to be the sentiments of\r\nour inhabitants, and if I am not mistaken, such assistances are\r\nto be expected from them, as you assure us are most sincerely and\r\nunanimously wished by every Virginian.\r\n\r\nI am, in the name of the Committee, Sir, your sincere friend and\r\nfellow-countryman,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Henrico County, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN WATKINS AND ARCHIBALD CARY.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 182, 183.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, February 1, 1775.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nCapt.

As this Town have appointed\r\na Committee to receive and distribute donations made for the\r\nrelief and employment of the sufferers by the Boston Port Bill,\r\nfor which charitable purpose these donations of your constituents\r\nare appropriated, your letter and the bill of lading are assigned\r\nto them, and in their name I am now to desire you to accept of\r\ntheir grateful acknowledgments for the benevolent part you have\r\ntaken, and also to make their returns of gratitude to the worthy\r\nGentlemen of Chesterfield and Cumberland County, for the very\r\nGenerous assistance they have afforded for the relief of the\r\ninhabitants of Boston, yet suffering, as you express it, under\r\ncruel oppression for the common cause of America. It is a sense\r\nof the dignity of the cause which animates them to suffer with\r\nthat fortitude which you are pleased candidly to attribute to\r\nthem; and while they are thus encouraged and supported by the\r\nsister Colonies, they will, by God's assistance, rather than\r\ninjure or stain that righteous cause, endure the conflict to the\r\nutmost.\r\n\r\nThe Committee have received 192 1/2 bushels of wheat, mentioned\r\nin your letter, as a donation from the people of Goochland\r\nCounty. You will greatly oblige the Committee if you will return\r\ntheir hearty thanks to their generous friends in that County.\r\n\r\nI am, with truth and sincerity, Gentlemen, your respectful friend\r\nand humble servant,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Chesterfield County, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n[R.

A sudden dissolution of the late\r\nparliament was a measure which I expected would take place. I\r\nmust needs allow that the ministry have acted a politic part; for\r\nif they had suffered the election to be put off till the spring,\r\nit might have cost some of them their heads. The new parliament\r\ncan with a very ill grace impeach them for their past conduct,\r\nafter having so explicitly avowed it. The thunder of the late\r\nspeech and the servile answers, I view as designed to serve the\r\npurposes of saving some men from the block. I cannot conclude\r\nthat lord North is upon the retreat, though there seems to be\r\nsome appearance of it. A deception of this kind would prove fatal\r\nto us. Our safety depends upon our being in readiness for the\r\nextreme event. Of this the people here are thoroughly sensible,\r\nand from the preparations they are making I trust in God they\r\nwill defend their liberties with dignity. If the ministry have\r\nnot abandoned themselves to folly and madness the firm union of\r\nthe colonies must be an important objection. The claims of the\r\ncolonies are consistent . . . and necessary to their own\r\nexistence as free subjects, and they will never recede from them.\r\nThe tools of power here are incessantly endeavouring to divide\r\nthem, but in vain. I wish the king's ministers would duly\r\nconsider what appears to me a very momentous truth, that one\r\nregular attempt to subdue those in any other colony, whatever may\r\nbe the first issue of the attempt, will open a quarrel, which\r\nwill never be closed till what some of THEM affect to apprehend,\r\nand we sincerely deprecate, shall take effect. Is it not then\r\nhigh time that they should hearken not to the clamours of\r\npassionate and interested men, but to the cool voice of impartial\r\nreason ? No sensible minister will think that millions of free\r\nsubjects, strengthened by such an union, will submit to be\r\nslaves; no honest minister would wish to see humanity thus\r\ndisgraced.\r\n\r\nMy attendance on the provincial congress now sitting here will\r\nnot admit of my enlarging at present. I will write you again by\r\nthe next opportunity, and till I have reason to suspect our\r\nadversaries have got some of my letters in their possession. I\r\nyet venture to subscribe, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH NYE.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 206, 207.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Feb. 21, 1775.2\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 17th of January, written in behalf of the\r\nCommittee of Correspondence for the Town of Sandwich, came duly\r\nto hand. Capt. Tobey, the bearer, was kind enough to deliver to\r\nthe Committee of this Town, appointed to receive Donations for\r\nthe relief and employment of the sufferers by the Boston Port\r\nBill, a charitable collection from the Congregational societies\r\nin Sandwich, amounting to nineteen pounds and three pence, for\r\nwhich he has our Treasurer's receipt. I am to desire you, in the\r\nname of our Committee, to return their sincere thanks to our\r\nworthy brethren, for the kindness they have shown to those\r\nsufferers by so generous a contribution for their support under\r\nthe cruel hand of oppression. It affords us abundant satisfaction\r\nto have the testimony of such respectable bodies of men, that\r\nthe inhabitants of this Town are not sufferers as evil doers, but\r\nfor \"their steady adherence to the cause of liberty,\" and we\r\ncannot but persuade ourselves that the Supreme Being approves our\r\nconduct, by whose all powerful influence the British American\r\ncontinent hath been united, and thus far successful, in\r\ndisappointing the enemies of our common liberty, in their hopes,\r\nthat by reducing the people to want and hunger, they should force\r\nthem to yield to their unrighteous demands.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, in the name of the Committee, with sincere good\r\nwishes, your friend and countryman,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Member of the committee of correspondence of Sandwich,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n2The actual date of this letter would appear to have been\r\nFebruary 25, from a prior manuscript copy in the library\r\nof the Massachusetts Historical Society.

We\r\nhave also sent you Twenty Pounds as directed by the Congress. We\r\nhope you will make the utmost Dispatch to Canada, as much depends\r\nupon it. We are with sincere good Wishes.\r\n\r\nYour humble Servants,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Pittsfield Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO INHABITANTS OF THE\r\n                              PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Feb 21 1775\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN/\r\n\r\nAt a Time when the British Colonies in North America are\r\nuniversally complaining of the Oppression of a corrupt\r\nAdministration, the Necessity and Advantage of a free\r\nCommunication of Sentiments as well as Intelligence must be\r\nobvious to all. Hence it is that the Committee of Correspondence\r\nappointed by the Town of Boston, have long been sollicitous of\r\nestablishing a friendly Intercourse with their Brethren and\r\nFellow Subjects in your Province. Having receivd Direction for\r\nthis important Purpose from our Provincial Congress sitting at\r\nCambridge on the first of this Instant,2 we take the Liberty of\r\naddressing a Letter to you Gentlemen, begging you would be\r\nassured that we have our mutual Safety and Prosperity at heart.\r\nIt is notorious to all the Colonies, that at the Conclusion of\r\nthe last War, a System was formd for the Destruction of our\r\ncommon Rights & Liberties. The Design of the British Ministry was\r\nto make themselves Masters of the Property of the Colonists, and\r\nto appropriate their Money in such a Manner as effectually to\r\nenslave them. The Ministry had influence enough in Parliament to\r\nprocure an Act, declaratory of a Right in the King Lords and\r\nCommons of Great Britain to make Laws binding his Majestys\r\nSubjects in America in all Cases whatsoever; and also to pass\r\nother Acts for taxing the American Subjects with the express\r\nPurpose of raising a Revenue, and appropriating the same for the\r\nSupport of Civil Government & defraying the Charges of the\r\nAdministration of justice in such Colonies where his Majesty\r\nshould think proper. The Principle upon which these Acts was\r\ngrounded, is in our opinion totally inconsistent with the Idea of\r\na free Government; for there can be no Freedom where a People is\r\ngovernd by the Laws of a Parliament, in which they have no Share\r\nand over which they can have no Controul; and if such a\r\nLegislature shall give and grant as much of our Money as it\r\npleases without our Consent in Person or by our Representatives\r\nwhat are we but Bond Servants instead of free Subjects? These\r\nRevenue Laws have in their operation been grievous to all the\r\nColonies & this in a particular Manner. Our own property has been\r\nextorted from us, and applied to the purpose of rendering our\r\nprovincial & only Legislature an insignificant Body; and by\r\nproviding for the Executive & judiciary Powers in the Province\r\nindependent of the People, to place them under the absolute Power\r\n& Controul of a Minister of State. Our righteous and stedfast\r\nopposition to this System of Slavery, has been artfully held up\r\nto our fellow Subjects in Britain as springing from a latent\r\nDesign to break off all political Connections with the Parent\r\nCountry and to set up an independent Government among ourselves.\r\nThe Letters of Bernard, Hutchinson and Oliver have been detected;\r\nby which it appears how great a Share they have had in\r\nmisrepresenting & calumniating this Country, and in plotting the\r\ntotal Ruin of its Liberties, for the Sake of enriching &\r\naggrandising themselves & their families. The two last named were\r\nNatives of the Colony, of ancient families in it, and having by\r\nArt & Intrigue gaind a considerable Influence over an\r\nunsuspecting People, and thereby a reputation in England, they\r\nfound Means to get themselves advancd to the highest Seats in\r\nthis Government; and they improvd these Advantages, to put a\r\nperiod to our free Constitution, by procuring an Act of\r\nParliament to disanul the essential parts of our Charter &\r\nconstitute an absolute despotick Government in its Stead;\r\nfourteen regiments are now assembled in this Capital, and\r\nReinforcements are expected, to put this Act into Execution. The\r\nPeople are determined that this shall not be done. They are\r\nunited & firmly resolvd to withstand it at the utmost Risque of\r\nLife and Fortune. A Scene therefore may open soon, unless the\r\nMinistry hearken to the Voice of Reason & Justice, which the\r\nFriends of Britain and America must deprecate.\r\n\r\nIn the same Session of the British Parliament the Act for\r\nestablishing a Government in the Province of Quebeck was passed;\r\nwhereby our Brethren & fellow Subjects in that Province are\r\ndeprived of the most valueable Securities of the British\r\nConstitution, for which they wisely stipulated, & which was\r\nsolemnly Guaranteed to them by the Royal Proclamation. These new\r\nGovernments of Quebeck and Massachusetts Bay, of a kind nearly\r\nalike, though before unheard of under a British\r\nKing, are looked upon by the other Colonies from Nova Scotia to\r\nGeorgia, as Models intended for them all; they all therefore\r\nconsider themselves as deeply concernd to have them abolishd; and\r\nit is for this Reason, that, although the Advantage of Delegates\r\nfrom your Province could not be had at the late Continental\r\nCongress, the Quebeck bill was considerd then not only as an\r\nintollerable Injury to the Subjects in that Province but as a\r\ncapital Grievance on all. It is an inexpressible Satisfaction to\r\nus to hear that our fellow Subjects in Canada, of French as well\r\nas English Extract, behold the Indignity of having such a\r\nGovernment obtruded upon them with a resentment which discovers\r\nthat they have a just Idea of Freedom & a due regard for\r\nthemselves & their Posterity. They were certainly misrepresented\r\nin the most shameful Manner, when, in order to enslave them it\r\nwas suggested that they were too ignorant to enjoy Liberty. We\r\nare greatly pleasd to hear that Remonstrances are already sent to\r\nthe Court & Parliament of Britain against an Act so disgraceful\r\nto human Nature, and Petitions for its repeal. We pray God to\r\nsucceed such noble Exertions, & that the Blessing of a free\r\nGovernment may be establishd there & transmitted to their latest\r\nposterity. The Enemies of American Liberty will surely be\r\nchagrind when they find, that the People of Quebeck have in\r\ncommon with other Americans the true Sentiments of Liberty. How\r\nconfounded must they be, when they see those very Peoples upon\r\nwhom they depended to aid them in their flagitious Designs,\r\nlending their Assistance to oppose them, cheerfully adopting the\r\nresolutions of the late Continental Congress & joyning their own\r\nDelegates in another, to be held at Philadelphia on the l0th of\r\nMay next. The Accession of that Colony in particular will add\r\ngreat Reputation & Weight to the Common Cause.\r\n\r\nWe rejoyce in the opportunity of informing you that the Assembly\r\nof the Island of Jamaica have warmly espousd our Interest. We\r\nhave seen a Copy of their Petition to the King in which they\r\ndeclare . . . .\r\n\r\nWe promise ourselves that great Good will be the Effect of this\r\ningenuous Application in Behalf of the Northern Colonies.\r\n\r\nAs it is possible you may not have seen the Kings Speech at the\r\nopening of the Parliament we inclose it. Lord Dartmouth in a\r\nCircular Letter to the Governors in America, a Copy of which we\r\nhave seen is pleasd to say \"The Resolutions of both Houses to\r\nsupport the great CONSTITUTIONAL Principles by which his Majestys\r\nConduct hath been governd, and their entire Approbation of the\r\nSteps his Majesty has taken for carrying into Execution THE LAWS\r\nPASSED IN THE LAST SESSION, will, I trust, have the Effect to\r\nremove the FALSE IMPRESSIONS which have been made upon the Minds\r\nof his Majestys Subjects in America, and put an End to those\r\nEXPECTATIONS OF SUPPORT in their UNWARRANTABLE PRETENSIONS, which\r\nhave been held forth by ARTFUL & DESIGNING MEN.\" Dated Whitehall\r\nDecr 20 1774. What Ideas his Lordship has of the Consistency of\r\nthe Quebec Act with constitutional Principles, which deprives the\r\nSubjects in Canada of those darling Privileges of the British\r\nConstitution, JURORS and the HABEAS CORPUS Act, and in all Crown\r\nCauses, consigns them over to Laws made without their Consent in\r\nperson or by their Representatives, perhaps by a Governor &\r\nCouncil dependent upon the Crown for their Places & Support, & to\r\nbe tryed by Judges equally dependent, we will leave to your\r\nConsideration. The Boston Port Bill is another act passed the\r\nlast Session & it is executed with the utmost Rigour. How\r\nconsistent was it with the great Principles of the Constitution\r\nfounded on the Laws of Nature & reason, to punish forty or fifty\r\nthousand Persons for what was done in all Probability by only\r\nforty or fifty. His Lordship may possibly find it very difficult\r\nwith his superior understanding to prove that the Destruction of\r\nthe Tea in Boston was, considering the Circumstances of the\r\nAction, morally or politically wrong, or, if he must needs think\r\nit was so, could his Lordship judge it inconsistent with the Laws\r\nof God for a Tribunal to proceed to try condemn and punish even\r\nthe Individuals who might be chargd with doing it without giving\r\nthem an opportunity of being heard or even calling them to\r\nanswer! Such however is the Policy, the Justice of the British\r\nCouncils. Such his Lordships Ideas of \"great constitutional\r\nPrinciples\"! Nothwithstanding the great Confidence of the Noble\r\nLord, we still have the strongest \"Expectations of Support,\" not\r\nas his Lordship would have it, in the \"unwarrantable Pretensions\r\nheld forth by artful & designing Men,\" but in the rational & just\r\nClaims of every unpensiond & disinterested Man in this extended\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nWe beg that you will favor the Committee of Correspondence by the\r\nreturn of this Messenger with your own Sentiments and those of\r\nthe respectable Inhabitants of your Colony; and shall be happy in\r\nuniting with you in the necessary Means of obtaining the Redress\r\nof our Common Grievances.\r\n\r\nWe are Gentlemen with sincere good Wishes,\r\n\r\nYour Friends & Countrymen,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1A similar letter was at the same time addressed to residents of\r\nMontreal; their reply, dated, April 28, I775, is in\r\nJournals of each Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, pp. 751,\r\n752.

The\r\ncare you have taken, with our worthy friend Nicholas Vandyke,\r\nEsq., in receiving these contributions, and your joint endeavors\r\nto have them remitted in the safest and most easy manner, is\r\ngratefully acknowledged by our Committee; and they have directed\r\nme to request that you would return their sincere thanks to the\r\npeople of New Castle County, for their great liberality towards\r\ntheir fellow subjects in this place who are still suffering under\r\nthe hand of oppression and tyranny. It will, I dare say, afford\r\nyou abundant satisfaction to be informed that the inhabitants of\r\nthis Town, with the exception only of a contemptible few, appear\r\nto be animated with an inextinguishable love of liberty. Having\r\nthe approbation of all the sister Colonies, and being thus\r\nsupported by their generous benefactions, they endure the most\r\nsevere trials, with a manly fortitude which disappoints and\r\nperplexes our common enemies. While a great continent is thus\r\nanxious for them, and constantly administering to their relief,\r\nthey can even smile with contempt on the feeble efforts of the\r\nBritish administration to force them to submit to tyranny, by\r\ndepriving them of the usual means of subsistence. The people of\r\nthis Province, behold with indignation a lawless army posted in\r\nits capital, with a professed design to overturn their free\r\nconstitution. They restrain their just resentments, in hopes that\r\nthe most happy effects will flow from the united applications of\r\nthe Colonies for their relief.\r\n\r\nMay Heaven grant that the councils of our sovereign may be guided\r\nby wisdom, that the liberties of America may be established, and\r\nharmony restored between the subjects in Britain and the\r\nColonies,\r\n\r\nI am, your very obliged friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ISAAC VAN DAM.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 191, 192.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Feb. 28 1775.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 30th December, addressed to John Hancock,\r\nEsq., has been laid before the Committee appointed by this Town,\r\nto receive and distribute the donations made for the employment\r\nand relief of the sufferers by the Act of Parliament, commonly\r\ncalled the Boston Port Bill. I am directed by the Committee to\r\nreturn you their hearty thanks for the care you have generously\r\ntaken in the disposal of a parcel of corn, (free of charge,)\r\nwhich was shipped for that charitable purpose, by our friends in\r\nEssex County, in Virginia, on board the schooner Sally, James\r\nPerkins, master, driven by stress of weather to St. Eustatia. An\r\naccount of sales of the corn was inclosed in your letter,\r\ntogether with a bill of exchange drawn by Mr. Sampson Mears on\r\nMr. Isaac Moses of New York, for one hundred seventy-one pounds,\r\neight shillings, that currency, being the amount thereof.\r\n\r\nThe opinion you have formed of the inhabitants of this Town, as\r\nhaving so virtuously dared to oppose a wicked and corrupt\r\nministry, in their tyrannical acts of despotism, must needs be\r\nvery flattering to them. The testimony of our friends so fully in\r\nour favor, more especially of those who are not immediately\r\ninterested in the unhappy contest between Britain and her\r\nColonies, must strongly excite this people to a perseverance in\r\nso righteous a cause.\r\n\r\nBe pleased, Sir, to accept of due acknowledgments for your kind\r\nwishes for our speedy relief, and be assured that I am, (in the\r\nname of the Committee,)\r\n\r\nYour very obliged friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1At St. Eustatia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM BLACK.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 188, 189; the text, dated March 2, 1775, is in Force,\r\nAmerican Archives, 4th ser., vol. ii., p. 16.]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 24th December last to Mr. Cushing and others,\r\nby Capt. Tompkins, of the schooner Dunmore, in which was brought\r\nseveral valuable donations from our friends in Virginia, to the\r\nsufferers in this Town by the Port Bill, was communicated to the\r\nCommittee appointed to receive such donations, and by their\r\ndirection I am to acquaint you that they cheerfully consented, at\r\nyour request, that the schooner should be discharged at Salem,\r\nthinking themselves under obligation to promote her dispatch,\r\nmore especially as there was unexpected delay in her loading, and\r\nyou have very generously declined receiving demurrage.\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly had abundant evidence of the firmness of our\r\nbrethren of Virginia in the American cause, and have reason to\r\nconfide in them that they will struggle hard for the prize now\r\ncontending for.\r\n\r\nI am desired by the Committee to acquaint you that a ship has\r\nlately sailed from this place bound to James River, in Virginia;\r\nthe master's name is Crowel Hatch. When he was building his ship,\r\na proposal was made to him by some of the Committee, to employ\r\nthe tradesmen of this Town, for which he should receive a\r\nrecompense by a discount of five per cent on their several bills,\r\nbut he declined to accept of the proposal. This, you are\r\nsensible, would have been the means of his employing our\r\nsufferers at their usual rates, and at the same time as cheap to\r\nhim as if he had got his vessel built by more ordinary workmen\r\nfrom the country. There is also another circumstance which I must\r\nrelate to you. Capt. Hatch proposed that the Committee should\r\nemploy our smith, in making anchors for his vessel, at a price by\r\nwhich they could get nothing but their labor for their pains,\r\nbecause he could purchase cast anchors imported here, for the\r\nsame price, which was refused. At this he was very angry, and\r\n(perhaps in a gust of passion) declared in the hearing of several\r\npersons of credit, that he was used ill, threatening repeatedly\r\nthat he would stop all the donations he could, and that no more\r\nshould come from the place where he was going to, meaning\r\nVirginia. These facts the Committee thought it necessary to\r\ncommunicate to you, and to beg the favor of you to use your\r\ninfluence that Capt. Hatch may not have it in his power, (if he\r\nshould be disposed,) to traduce the Committee and injure the\r\nsufferers in this Town, for whose relief our friends in Virginia\r\nhave so generously contributed.\r\n\r\nI am, in the name of the Committee, Sir, your obliged friend and\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1James River, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DICK, CHARLES WASHINGTON, AND GEORGE THORNTON.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 211.]\r\nBOSTON, March--1775.\r\n\r\nGFNTLEMEN, Your letter of the 23d of January last, directed to\r\nthe Overseers of the Poor of the Town of Boston, has been laid\r\nbefore the Committee appointed to receive and distribute\r\nDonations for the sufferers by that cruel and unrighteous Act\r\nof the British Parliament, commonly called the Boston Port Bill.\r\nI am now in behalf of this Committee to acknowledge the receipt\r\nof seven hundred thirty-six and a quarter bushels wheat, twenty-\r\nfive bushels Indian corn, three barrels flour, and three barrels\r\nbread, shipped on board the schooner Betsey, Capt. John Foster,\r\nbeing a very generous contribution of Spotsylvania County, in\r\nVirginia, to those sufferers.\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased, gentlemen, to return the sincere thanks of\r\nthe Committee to our friends of that County, for the warm\r\nsympathy they have in this instance discovered with their\r\ndistressed brethren in this Capital. Encouraged by these liberal\r\ndonations, the inhabitants of this Town still endure their\r\ncomplicated sufferings with patience. As men, they feel the\r\nindignities which are offered to them. As citizens, they suppress\r\ntheir just resentment. But I trust in God, that this much injured\r\nColony, when urged to it by extreme necessity, will exert itself\r\nat the utmost hazard in the defence of our common rights. I\r\nflatter myself that I am not mistaken, while they deprecate that\r\nnecessity, they are very active in preparing for it.\r\n\r\nI am, Gentlemen, in behalf of the Committee, your obliged and\r\naffectionate friend and countryman,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Spottsylvania County, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON March 4 1775\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nTill now I did not hear of this opportunity of writing to you. I\r\nhave therefore only a few Moments before the Vessel sails to give\r\nyou a short Account of Affairs here. General Gage is still at the\r\nhead of his Troops with a professd Design to put the regulating &\r\nthe Murder Acts into Execution. I therefore consider this Man as\r\nvoid of a Spark of Humanity, who can deliberately be the\r\nInstrument of depriving our Country of its Liberty, or the people\r\nof their Lives in its Defence. We are not however dismayed;\r\nbelieve me this People are prepared to give him a warm Reception\r\nif he shall venture to make the bold Attack. I know very well the\r\npolicy of great Men on your side the Water. They are backward to\r\nexert themselves in the Cause of America, lest we should desert\r\nour selves and leave them to the Contempt and Ridicule of a\r\nMinistry whom they heartily despise. But assure them that though\r\nfrom the Dictates of sound Policy we restrain our just Resentment\r\nat the Indignities already offered to us, we shall not fail to\r\nresist the Tyranny which threatens us at the utmost risque. The\r\npublick Liberty must be preservd though at the Expense of many\r\nLives!\r\n\r\nWe had the last Lords Day a small Specimen of the military Spirit\r\nof our Countrymen in the Town of Salem an Account of which is in\r\nthe inclosed paper. I am just now told by a Gentleman upon whose\r\nVeracity I depend that he knew that Coll L-------- at the\r\nGovernors Table had declared this Account in every part of it to\r\nbe true, excepting his giving orders to fire.\r\n\r\nEvery Art has been practicd to intimidate our leading Men on the\r\npopular side, at the same time the General is held up by the\r\nFriends of Government as a most humane Man, in order to induce\r\nthe leading Men to behave in such a Manner as to be shelterd\r\nunder his Banner in Case of Extremity--this may have an Effect on\r\nSome, but very few--We keep our Town Meeting alive1 and to-morrow\r\nan oration is to be deliverd by Dr Warren. It was thought best to\r\nhave an experiencd officer in the political field on this\r\noccasion, as we may possibly be attackd in our Trenches.\r\n\r\nThe Town of Marshfield, have lately applied to G. Gage for LEAVE\r\nto have a Meeting, according to the Act of Parliament, & have\r\nresolvd as you may observe by the inclosd. They will be dealt\r\nwith according to the Law of the Continental Congress. The Laws\r\nof which are more observd throughout this Continent than any\r\nhuman Laws whatever.\r\n\r\nAnother Congress will meet at Philadelphia in May next. Every\r\nColony has appointed its Delegates (I mean those which did\r\nbefore) except N York, whose Assembly I have just heard have\r\nresolvd not to send any. The People of that City & Colony, are\r\ninfested with Court Scribblers who have labord, perhaps with some\r\nSuccess, to divide them; they are however in general firm, and\r\nhave with regard to the Arrival of a Ship from London since the\r\nfirst of February, behaved well.--You know their Parliament is\r\nseptennial--and therefore must be corrupted. It is best that the\r\nTories in their house have acted without Disguise. This is their\r\nlast Session and the house will, I hope, be purgd at the next\r\nElection.\r\n\r\nThere is a Combination in that Colony of high Church Clergymen &\r\ngreat Landholders--of the former, a certain Dr C is the head; who\r\nknows an American Episcopate cannot be establishd and\r\nconsequently he will not have the pleasure of strutting thro the\r\nColonies in Lawn Sleeves, until the Authority of parliament to\r\nmake Laws for us binding in all Cases whatever is settled. The\r\nLatter are Lords over many Slaves; and are afraid of the\r\nConsequences that would follow, if a Spirit of Liberty should\r\nprevail among them. This however is so far the Case yt I doubt\r\nnot the People will chuse Delegates for the Congress, as they did\r\nbefore.--When that Congress meets, it is expected, that they will\r\nagree upon a Mode of Opposition (unless our Grievances are\r\nredressd) which will render the Union of the Colonies more\r\nformidable than ever. Concordia res parvae crescunt.\r\n\r\nWe have lately opend a correspondence with Canada2 which, I dare\r\nsay will be attended with great and good Effects. Jonathan\r\nPhilanthrop under the Signature of Massachutensis, & other\r\npensiond Scribblers have been endeavoring to terrify the people\r\nwith strange Ideas of Treason & Rebellion, but in vain.

I\r\nnever had the least doubt in my Mind but that the Colony of South\r\nCarolina, which has distinguishd itself through all our Struggles\r\nfor the Establishment of American Liberty, would approve of and\r\nsupport the proceedings of the Continental Congress. I cannot but\r\nthink that every sensible Man (Whig or Tory) must see that they\r\nare well adapted to induce the British Government to do us\r\njustice, and I still flatter my self they will operate to that\r\nEffect. There are a Set of infamous & atrociously wicked Men,\r\nhere & there in this Continent, who have been endeavoring to make\r\nthe Appearance of Divisions among us, in order that our Enemies\r\nin Britain may avail themselves of it, and thereby prevent the\r\ngood Effects of the Decisions of the Congress; but every\r\nimpartial Man who has gone from America must be able to convince\r\nthe Nation, that no human Law has ever been more observd than\r\nthose resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe people of this Town have at length gone through the Winter\r\nwith tollerable Comfort. Next to the gracious Interposition of\r\nHeaven we acknowledge the unexampled Liberality of our Sister\r\nColonies. If I am called an Enthusiast for it, I cannot help\r\nthinking that this Union amoung the Colonies and Warmth of\r\nAffection, can be attributed to Nothing less than the Agency of\r\nthe supreme Being. if we believe that he superintends & directs\r\nthe great Affairs of Empires, we have reason to expect the\r\nrestoration and Establishment of the publick Liberties, unless by\r\nour own Misconduct we have renderd ourselves unworthy of it; for\r\nhe certainly wills the Happiness of those of his Creatures who\r\ndeserve it, & without publick Liberty, we cannot be happy.\r\n\r\nLast Monday an Oration was deliverd to a very crowded Audience in\r\nthis Town in Commemoration of the Massacre perpetrated by Preston\r\nand his party on the 5 of March 1770--Many of the Officers of the\r\nArmy attended. They behaved tollerably well till the Oration was\r\nended, when some of them began a Disturbance, which was soon\r\nsuppressed & the remaining Business of the Meeting went on as\r\nusual.2\r\n\r\nOn Thursday following a simple Country man was inveigled by a\r\nSoldier to bargain with him for a Gun; for this he was put under\r\nGuard and the next day was tarred & featherd by some of the\r\nOfficers and Soldiers of the 47. 1 did not see this military\r\nparade, but am told & indeed it is generally said without any\r\nContradiction that I have heard, that the Lt Coll headed the\r\nProcession. We are at a Loss to account for this Conduct of a\r\npart of the Army in the face of the Sun unless there were good\r\nAssurances that the General would connive at it. However he says\r\nhe is very angry at it. You see what Indignities we suffer,\r\nrather than precipitate a Crisis.\r\n\r\nI have not time to write any more, only to acquaint you that this\r\nLetter will be delivd to you by Mr Wm Savage a son of one of my\r\nmost valueable Acquaintances. Any Civilities which you may show\r\nhim will be gratefully acknowledgd by\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Endorsed as \"To a Southern Friend.\"\r\n2Hutchinson, in his diary for September 6, 1775, mentions a call\r\nfrom Colonel James, who left Nantasket July 29, and continues:\r\n\"He tells an odd story of the intention of the Officers the 5\r\nMarch that 300 were in the Meeting to hear Dr Warrens oration--\r\nthat if he had said anything against the King &c an Officer was\r\nprepared who stood near, with an Egg to have thrown in his face\r\nand that was to have been a signal to draw swords & they would\r\nhave massacred Hancock Adams & hundreds more & he added he wished\r\nthey had. I am glad they did not for I think it would have been\r\nan everlasting disgrace to attack a body of people without arms\r\nto defend themselves. He says one Officer cried Fy Fy. S. Adams\r\nimmediately asked who dared say so and then said to the Officer\r\nhe should mark him. The Officer answered and I will mark you. I\r\nlive at such a place & shall be ready to meet you. Adams said be\r\nwould go to the General.

The\r\nschooner was by contrary winds driven to the island of St.\r\nEustatia. Mr. Isaac Van Dam,2 a reputable merchant of that place,\r\ngenerously took the care of the corn, and having made sale of it,\r\nremitted the amount of the proceeds, (free of all expense,) being\r\none hundred seventy-one pounds 8/, New York currency, in a bill\r\nof exchange, drawn on Mr. Isaac Moses, of that city, which we\r\ndoubt not will be duly honored.\r\n\r\nThe Committee very gratefully acknowledge their obligations to\r\nyou, Gentlemen, for your trouble in transmitting this charitable\r\ndonation, and they request that you would return their sincere\r\nthanks to the benevolent people of your County, for their great\r\nliberality towards the oppressed inhabitants of this devoted\r\nTown.\r\n\r\nThis is one among many testimonies afforded to us, that the\r\nVirginians are warmly disposed to assist their injured brethren\r\nand fellow-subjects in this place. This consideration has\r\nhitherto encouraged our inhabitants to bear indignities with\r\npatience and having the continual approbation of all the\r\nColonies, with that of their own minds, as being sufferers in the\r\ncommon cause of their country, I am fully persuaded of their\r\nresolution, by God's assistance, to persevere in the virtuous\r\nstruggle, disdaining to purchase an exemption from suffering by a\r\ntame surrender of any part of the righteous claim of America. May\r\nHeaven give wisdom and fortitude to each of the Colonies, and\r\nsucceed their unremitted efforts, in the establishment of public\r\nliberty on an immoveable foundation.\r\n\r\nI am, in behalf of our Committee, Gentlemen, your affectionate\r\nfriend and countryman,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Archibald Ritchie, Jonathan Lee, and Robert Beverly, of Essex\r\nCounty, Virginia.\r\n2 Cf., page 190.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL PURVIANCE, JUNIOR.1\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., p. 263.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, March 14th, 1775.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI am directed by the Committee appointed by this Town, to\r\nacquaint you that your bill of exchange, drawn on Jeremiah Lee,\r\nEsq., for two hundred pounds Maryland currency, being the amount\r\nof a generous collection made by the respectable people of the\r\nmiddle division of Frederick County, for the relief of the\r\nsufferers by the Boston Port Bill, is duly received.

V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams,\r\nvol. ii., pp. 256, 257, 281.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON March [21] 1775\r\n\r\nSIR/\r\n\r\nI am much obligd to you for your Favor of the 4th of Feb last by\r\nCap Leighton. From the begining of this great Contest with the\r\nMother Country Virginia has distinguishd herself in Support of\r\nAmerican Liberty; and we have abundant Testimony, in the liberal\r\nDonations receivd from all parts of that Colony, for the\r\nSufferers in this Town, of their Zeal and Unanimity in the\r\nSupport of that all important Cause. I have the pleasure to\r\ninform you, that the People of this Colony are also firm and\r\nunited, excepting a few detestable Men most of whom are in this\r\nTown. General Gage is still here with Eleven Regiments besides a\r\nDetachment from the 59th & 65th, yet it is generally supposd\r\nthere are not more than 2500 effective Men in all. They have been\r\nvery sickly thro' the Winter past. Many of them have died and\r\nmany others have deserted. I have lately seen a joynt List, which\r\nI believe to be a true one, of the Royal Irish and the Detachment\r\nfrom the 65th in which the whole Number was 167 & only 102\r\neffective. But though the Number of the Troops are diminishd, the\r\nInsolence of the officers (at least some of them) is increased.\r\nIn private Rencounters I have not heard of a single Instance of\r\ntheir coming off other than second best. I will give you several\r\nInstances of their Behavior in publick. On the 6th Instant there\r\nwas an Adjournment of our Town Meeting when an Oration was\r\ndeliverd in Commemoration of the Massacre on the 5th of March\r\n1770. I had long expected they would take that Occasion to beat\r\nup a Breeze, and therefore (having the Honor of being the\r\nModerator of the Meeting and seeing Many of the Officers present\r\nbefore the Orator came in) I took Care to have them treated with\r\nCivility, inviting them into convenient Seats &c that they might\r\nhave no pretence to behave ill, for it is a good Maxim in\r\nPoliticks as well as War to put & keep the Enemy in the wrong.\r\nThey behaved tollerably well till the oration was finishd when\r\nupon a Motion made for the Appointmt of another orator they began\r\nto hiss, which irritated the Assembly to the greatest Degree, and\r\nConfusion ensued. They however did not gain their End, which was\r\napparently to break up the Meeting, for order was soon restored &\r\nwe proceeded regularly & finishd. I am perswaded that were it not\r\nfor the Danger of precipitating a Crisis, not a Man of them would\r\nhave been spared. It was provoking enough to the whole Core that\r\nwhile there were so many Troops stationd here with the Design of\r\nsuppressing Town Meetings there should yet be a Meeting, for the\r\npurpose of delivering an Oration to commemorate a Massacre\r\nperpetrated by Soldiers & to show the Danger of Standing Armies.\r\nThey therefore it seems a few days after vented their passion on\r\na poor simple Countryman the state of whose Case is drawn up by\r\nhimself and sworn to before a Magistrate as you will see by the\r\ninclosd. Thus you see that the practice of tarring & feathering\r\nwhich has so often been exclaimd against by the Tories, & even in\r\nthe British House of Commons, as inhuman & barbarous, is at\r\nlength revivd by some of the polite Gentlemen of the British\r\nArmy, stationd in this place, professedly to prevent Riots. Some\r\nGentlemen of the Town waited on the General on this Occasion. He\r\nAPPEARD to be angry at it & declared that he knew Nothing about\r\nany such Design. He said that he indeed heard an irregular beat\r\nof the Drum (for they passed by his House) but thought they were\r\ndrumming a bad Woman through the Streets! This to be sure would\r\nnot have been a Riot. The Selectmen of Billerica an Inland town\r\nabout thirty Miles distant to which the poor abused Man belongs,\r\nhave since made a remonstrance to the General a Copy of which is\r\ninclosd; the General promised them that he would enquire into the\r\nMatter, but we hear nothing more about it. Some say that he is\r\naffraid of displeasing his Officers & has no Command over them.\r\nHow this may be I cannot say. If he does not soon punish the\r\nofficers concernd in this dirty Action, which was done in direct\r\nDefiance of their own Articles, one would think it is so. If he\r\ndoes not do it, he must look to his own Commission. Qui non\r\nprohibet nec puniit fecit. This Town resents it and have directed\r\ntheir Committee of Correspondence to enquire into this and other\r\nConduct and have Depositions before Magistrates in perpetuam rei\r\nMemoriam, to be improvd as Opportunity may offer. A Change of\r\nMinisters and proper representations may reduce a Tyrant, at\r\nleast to the Condition of a private Subject. The People are\r\nuniversally enragd, but from the Motives of sound Policy their\r\nresentment is for the present restraind. Last Saturday a Waggon\r\ngoing from this Town into the Country was stopped by the Guards\r\non the Neck, having Nine Boxes of Ball Cartridges which were\r\nseisd by the Troops. Application has been made to the General, by\r\na private Gentleman who claimd them as his property. The General\r\ntold him that he would order them to be markd as such but they\r\ncould not THEN be deliverd. The Gentleman told him that if they\r\nwere not soon deliverd he should seek recompence elsewhere. I\r\nthink you may be satisfied that though \"the General has\r\ncompleated his Fortification\" at the only Entrance into the Town\r\nby Land, and our Harbour is still shut up, \"our People are in\r\ngood Spirits,\" and I dare say \" the Business of Discipline goes\r\non well.\"\r\n\r\nI have Just received Letters from our mutual Friends in London\r\ndated the 24, 26 & 28 Decr & 4 & 7 Jany, some Extracts from which\r\nI have thought it necessary to have inserted in our News papers,\r\nas youl see by the inclosd. One paragraph which alarms me I have\r\nnot disclosd to any one, which is this \"I have been in the\r\nCountry with Lord Chatham to shew him the petition of the\r\nCongress of which he highly approvd. He is of Opinion that a\r\nsolemn Renunciation of the Right to TAX on the one side, and an\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE SUPREMACY on the other should accompany the\r\nrepeal of all the obnoxious Acts. Without that, he says, the\r\nHearts of the two Countries will not openly embrace each other\r\nwith unfeigned Affection & Reconcilement.\" In this short Sentence\r\nI think it is I easy to see that his Lordships plan of\r\nreconciliation is the same now with that which he held forth in\r\nhis Speech at the time of the repeal of the Stamp Act. However\r\nhighly I think of his Lordships INTEGRITY I confess I am chagrind\r\nto think that he expects an Acknowledgment of the Supremacy in\r\nterms on our part. I imagine that after such an Acknowledgment,\r\nthere may be a variety of Ways by which Great Brittain may\r\nenslave us besides taxing us without our Consent. The possibility\r\nof it should greatly awaken our Apprehensions. Let us take Care\r\nlest America, in Lieu of a Thorn in her foot should have a Dagger\r\nin her heart. Our united Efforts have hitherto succeeded. This is\r\nnot a Time for us to relax our Measures. Let us like prudent\r\nGenerals improve upon our Success, and push for perfect political\r\nFreedom.\r\n\r\nMr John Allston a young Gentleman in my Neighborhood who owns the\r\nVessel in which Cap Leighton returns is also a Passenger on\r\nboard. His Views are to form Commercial Connections in Virginia.\r\nYou will excuse me if I bespeak your favorable Notice of him\r\nshould he fall in your way.\r\n\r\nI am with sincere regards\r\nYour affectionate Friend & Countryman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th ser., vol.\r\niv., pp. 239, 240.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON 21 March, 1775.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have before me your letter of the 10th of February, directed to\r\nMr. Hancock, Mr. Cushing and myself, inclosing a bill of lading\r\nfor one thousand and ninety-two bushels of grain, being a\r\ngenerous donation sent by the inhabitants of Westmoreland County,\r\nin Virginia, to the sufferers in this Town by the Boston Port\r\nBill. Soon after that barbarous edict arrived, our inhabitants\r\nhad notice of the kind intentions of our brethren of the other\r\nColonies, towards them, and they appointed a Committee to receive\r\nand distribute such donations as should be made. I have their\r\ndirection to request that you would be pleased to return their\r\ngrateful acknowledgments to our worthy friends in your County,\r\nfor this very liberal contribution, and to assure them that it\r\nwill be disposed of agreeable to their benevolent design.\r\n\r\nYour candid opinion of the inhabitants of this Town as having\r\nsome share in defending the common rights of British America,\r\ncannot but be very flattering to them, and it will excite in them\r\na laudable ambition, by their future conduct, to merit the\r\ncontinuance of it. They are unjustly oppressed, but, by the\r\nsmiles of Heaven and the united friendship and support of all\r\nNorth America, the designs of our enemies to oblige them make\r\nbase compliances, to the injury of our common cause, have been\r\nhitherto frustrated. They bear repeated insults of the grossest\r\nkind, not from want of the feelings of just resentment, or spirit\r\nenough to make ample returns, but from principles of sound policy\r\nand reason. Put your enemy in the wrong, and keep him so, is a\r\nwise maxim in politics, as well as in war. They consider\r\nthemselves as connected with a great continent, deeply interested\r\nin their patient sufferings. They had rather, therefore, forego\r\nthe gratification of revenging affronts and indignities, than\r\nprejudice that all important cause which they have so much at\r\nheart, by precipitating a crisis. When they are pushed by clear\r\nnecessity for the defence of their liberties to the trial of\r\narms, I trust in God, they will convince their friends and their\r\nenemies, of their military skill and valor. Their constant prayer\r\nto God is, to prevent such necessity; but they are daily\r\npreparing for it. I rejoice with you, Sir, in most earnestly\r\nwishing for the speedy and full restoration of the rights of\r\nAmerica, which are violated with so high and arbitrary a hand,\r\nand am, in behalf of the Committee, with great respect,\r\n\r\nYour obliged and affectionate friend and countryman,\r\n\r\nP.

How can you live without\r\npowder and guns? But we hope to supply you soon with both, of our\r\nown making.\r\n\r\nBrothers,--They have made a law to establish the religion of the\r\nPope in Canada, which lies so near you. We much fear some of your\r\nchildren may be induced, instead of worshipping the only true\r\nGod, to pay HIS dues to images made with their own hands.\r\n\r\nBrothers,--These and many other hardships we are threatened with,\r\nwhich, no doubt, in the end will equally affect you; for the same\r\nreason they would get our lands, they would take away yours. All\r\nwe want is, that we and you may enjoy that liberty and security\r\nwhich we have a right to enjoy, and that we may not lose that\r\ngood land which enables us to feed our wives and children. We\r\nthink it our duty to inform you of our danger, and desire you to\r\ngive notice to all your kindred; and as we much fear they will\r\nattempt to cut our throats, and if you should allow them to do\r\nthat, there will nobody remain to keep them from you, we\r\ntherefore earnestly desire you to whet your hatchet, and be\r\nprepared with us to defend our liberties and lives.\r\n\r\nBrothers,--We humbly beseech that God who lives above, and does\r\nwhat is right here below, to enlighten your minds to see that you\r\nought to endeavor to prevent our fathers from bringing those\r\nmiseries upon us; and to his good providence we commend you.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1It is here stated that portions of the original draft in the\r\nautograph of Adams were in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS.

ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA June 10 1775\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYour last Letter to me was dated the 26 of April. I fear you\r\nthink too much of the Expence of Postage. I beg of you my dear\r\nnot to regard that, for I shall with the utmost Chearfulness pay\r\nfor as many Letters as you shall send to me. It was with very\r\ngreat Pleasure that I heard from Dr Church that he met you on the\r\nRoad and that you were well on the 20th of last Month--that your\r\nMother had been releasd from the Prison Boston. I also have this\r\nday been told that you were at Cambridge on Saturday last in good\r\nhealth. It would afford me double Satisfaction to have such\r\nAccounts under your own hand. Dr Churchs Servant assures me that\r\nhe saw my Son at Cambridge the day before he left that place; but\r\nthe Dr himself tells me that when he saw you (which was after he\r\nleft Cambridge) you expressd great Concern that he was still in\r\nBoston. I am impatient to hear of him and the two Servants,--Pray\r\ndo not omit writing to me by the next post which passes by your\r\nDoor--you may inclose your Letter to our Brother Checkley1 at\r\nProvidence with your Request to him to forward it to me by the\r\nConstitutional Post, which he will readily comply with.\r\n\r\nI have wrote you five or six Letters since my Departure from\r\nWorcester2 the latter End of April. I wish you would inform me\r\nhow many you have receivd and their Dates.\r\n\r\nI have lately receivd a Letter from your Brother Andrew and\r\nanother from your Brother Samll--they were both well in April\r\nlast when their Letters were dated and desire their due Regards\r\nto your Mother and all friends. I am now my dear to inform you\r\nthat your Brother Saml (who supposd I should receive his Letter\r\nin Boston) desired me to communicate to your Mother the sorrowful\r\nNews of the Death of her Son Billy on the 7th of April--he had\r\nbeen long ailing, and was at length seizd with the bilious\r\nCholick and died in three days. May God support your Mother and\r\nother Relations under this repeated Affliction. Saml writes me\r\nthat he left no Will and that he will take Care of his Effects--\r\nwhich I think by Law belong to his Mother to whom they will be\r\nsent when the Times admit of it. I will write to your Brother at\r\nSt Eustatia by the first Vessel from this place. I beg you not to\r\nsuffer your Mind to be overborn with these Tydings. Open the\r\nMatter to your Mother with your usual Discretion.\r\n\r\nI am confident it will afford you Pleasure to be informd that I\r\nam in health. My Duty to your Mother--tell my Daughter & Sister\r\nPolly, & Hannah (who I hope is with you) that I love them, and be\r\nassured my dear Betsy, that I am with the warmest Affection\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf page 127.\r\n2Cf.

Had I not heard that you dined with some of\r\nmy Friends at Cambridge about a fortnight ago I should have\r\nsuspected that you had changed your Place of Abode at Dedham and\r\nthat therefore my Letters had not reached you, or I should have\r\nbeen very anxious lest by some bodily Indisposition you were\r\nrenderd unable to write to me. It is painful to me to be absent\r\nfrom you. As your Letters would in some Measure afford me\r\nReliefe, I beg you would omit no Opportunity of writing. Your\r\nBackwardness leads me to apprehend there has something happend\r\nwhich would be disagreable to me to hear. If any ill Accident has\r\nbefallen my Son or any other person dear to me, I would chuse to\r\nhear it. Our Boston Friends are some of them confined in a\r\nGarrison, others dispersd I know not where. Pray, my dear, let me\r\nknow as much about them as you can. I make no Doubt but it will\r\nbe a pleasure to you to hear that I am in good Health and\r\nSpirits. I wish I could consistently inform you what is doing\r\nhere. I can however tell you that Matters go on, though slower\r\nthan one could wish, yet agreable to my Mind. My Love to all\r\nFriends. I earnestly recommend you and them to the Protection\r\nand Blessing of Heaven. The Bearer is waiting for this Letter, I\r\nmust therefore conclude with assuring you that I am with the\r\ngreatest Sincerity, my dear Betsy,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate husband and Friend\r\n\r\nJune 17\r\n\r\nWe have had Occasion to detain the Bearer which gives me the\r\nPleasure of acknowledging your very acceptable and obliging\r\nLetter of the 6th Instant. I am rejoycd to hear that you are\r\nrecoverd from a late Indisposition of Body. I pray God to confirm\r\nyour Health. I wonder that you have receivd but one Letter from\r\nme since I left Worcester. I wrote to you at Hartford and New\r\nYork and I do not know how often since I came into this City.\r\n\r\nIt is a great Satisfaction to me to be assured from you that your\r\nMother & Family are out of Boston, and also my boy Job. I commend\r\nhim for his Contrivance in getting out. Tell him from me to be a\r\ngood Boy. I wish to hear that my Son and honest Surry were\r\nreleasd from their Confinement in that Town. I am much pleasd my\r\ndear with the good Sense and publick Spirit you discoverd in your\r\nAnswer to Majr Kains Message--your Concern for my comfortable\r\nSubsistence here is very kind and obliging to me--when I am in\r\nWant of Money I will write to you.\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J.

I cannot but be greatly rejoycd\r\nat the tryed Valor of our Countrymen, who by all Accounts behavd\r\nwith an Intrepidity becoming those who fought for their Liberties\r\nagainst the mercenary Soldiers of a Tyrant. It is painful to me\r\nto reflect upon the Terror I must suppose you were under on\r\nhearing the Noise of War so near you. Favor me, my dear, with an\r\nAccount of your Apprehensions at that time, under your own hand.\r\nI pray God to cover the heads of our Countrymen in every day of\r\nBattle, and ever to protect you from Injury in these distracted\r\nTimes. The Death of our truly amiable and worthy Friend Dr Warren\r\nis greatly afflicting. The Language of Friendship is, how shall\r\nwe resign him! But it is our Duty to submit to the Dispensations\r\nof Heaven, \"Whose Ways are ever gracious, ever just.\" He fell in\r\nthe glorious Struggle for the publick Liberty.\r\n\r\nMr Pitts and Dr Church inform me that my dear Son has at length\r\nescapd from the Prison of Boston. I have inclosd a Letter to him,\r\nwhich I desire you would seal and deliver to him, or send it to\r\nhim if he is not with you. Remember me to my dear Hannah and\r\nSister Polly and to all Friends. Let me know where good old Surry\r\nis.\r\n\r\nGage has made me respectable by naming me first among those who\r\nare to receive no favor from him. I thoroughly despise him and\r\nhis Proclamation. It is the Subject of Ridicule here, as you may\r\nsee by the inclosd which I have taken from this days paper. I am\r\nin good health and Spirits. Pray my dear let me have your Letters\r\nmore frequently--by every opportunity. The Clock is now striking\r\ntwelve. I therefore wish you a good Night.\r\n\r\nYours most affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA July 30 1775\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nAs I have no doubt but the Congress will adjourn in a few days,\r\nperhaps tomorrow, I do not expect to have another opportunity of\r\nwriting to you before I set off for New England. The arduous\r\nBusiness that has been before the Congress and the close\r\nApplication of the Members, added to the Necessity and Importance\r\nof their visiting their several Colonies & attending their\r\nrespective Conventions, have inducd them to make a Recess during\r\nthe sultry Month of August. My Stay with you must be short, for I\r\nsuppose the Congress will meet again early in September. I have\r\nlong ago learnd to deny my self many of the sweetest\r\nGratifications in Life for the Sake of my Country. This I may\r\nventure to say to you, though it might be thought Vanity in me to\r\nsay it to others. I hear that my Constituents have given me the\r\nChoice of a Seat in either House of our new Assembly--that is,\r\nthat Boston have chosen me again one of their Members, and the\r\nHouse have chosen me one of the Council--you know better than I\r\ndo, whether there be a foundation for the Report. My Constituents\r\ndo as they please, and so they ought. I never intrigud for their\r\nSuffrages,and I never will. I am intimately conscious that I have\r\nservd them as well as I could, and I believe they think so\r\nthemselves. I heartily wish I could serve them better--but the\r\nTestimony of my own Conscience and their Approbation, makes me\r\nfeel my self superior to the Threats of a Tyrant, either at St\r\nJamess or in the Garrison of Boston.\r\n\r\nI have receivd a Letter from my Friend Mr Dexter dated the 18\r\nInstant. Present my due Regards to him. He informd me that you\r\nhad been at his house a few Evenings before and was well, and\r\nthat you deliverd a Letter to a young Gentleman present, to carry\r\nto Cambridge for Conveyance to me. I am greatly mortified in not\r\nhaving receivd it by the Express that brought me his Letter.\r\n\r\nMr Adams2 of Roxbury also wrote me that he had often met with you\r\nand was surprised at your Steadiness & Calmness under Tryal. I am\r\nalways pleasd to hear you well spoken of, because I know it is\r\ndoing you Justice.\r\n\r\nI pray God that at my Return I may find you and the rest of my\r\ndear Friends in good health. The Treatment which those who are\r\nstill in Boston meet with fills me with Grief and Indignation.\r\nWhat Punishment is due to General Gage for his Perfidy!\r\n\r\nPay my proper Respects to your Mother & Family, Mr & Mrs Henshaw,\r\nmy Son & Daughter, Sister Polly &c. Tell Job and Surry that I do\r\nnot forget them. I conclude, my dear, with the warmest Affection\r\n\r\nYour\r\n\r\nP. S. Mr William Barrell will deliver you this Letter--he was\r\nkind enough to tell me he would go out of his way rather than not\r\noblige me in carrying it--he boards with us at Mrs Yards, and is\r\na reputable Merchant in this City. Richard Checkley is his\r\nApprentice--you know his Sister Mrrs Eliot.

I think it has contributed to the\r\nestablishment of my health, for which I am obliged to my friend\r\nMr. John Adams, who kindly offered me one of his horses the day\r\nafter we sat off from Watertown.\r\n\r\nI write you this letter, principally to put you in mind of the\r\npromise you made me to give me intelligence of what is doing in\r\nour assembly and the camp. Believe me, Sir, it is of great\r\nimportance that we should be informed of every circumstance of\r\nour affairs. The eyes of friends and foes are attentively I fixed\r\non our province, and if jealousy or envy can sully its\r\nreputation, you may depend upon it they will not miss the\r\nopportunity. It behoves our friends, therefore, to be very\r\ncircumspect, and in all their public conduct to convince the\r\nworld, that they are influenced not by partial or private\r\nmotives, but altogether with a view of promoting the public\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nSome of our military gentlemen have, I fear, disgraced us; it is\r\nthen important that every anecdote that concerns a man of real\r\nmerit among them, and such I know there are, be improved, as far\r\nas decency will admit of it, to their advantage and to the honor\r\nof a colony, which, for its zeal in the great cause, well as its\r\nsufferings, deserves so much of America.\r\n\r\nUntil I visited head quarters at Cambridge, I had never heard of\r\nthe valour of Prescott at Bunker's hill, nor the ingenuity of\r\nKnox and Waters in planning the celebrated works at Roxbury. We\r\nwere told here that there were none in our camp who understood\r\nthe business of an engineer, or any thing more than the manual\r\nexercise of the gun. This we had from great authority, and for\r\nwant of more certain intelligence were obliged at least to be\r\nsilent. There are many military geniuses at present unemployed\r\nand overlooked, who I hope, when the army is new modelled, will\r\nbe sought after and invited into the service of their country.\r\nThey must be sought after, for modest merit declines pushing\r\nitself into public view. I know your disinterested zeal, and\r\ntherefore need add no more than to assure you that I am with\r\ncordial esteem,\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Octobr 20th 1775.1\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI have not yet receivd a Letter from you, altho' it is more than\r\nseven Weeks since I left you. I do not mean to chide you, for I\r\nam satisfied it is not your Fault. Your Want of Leisure or\r\nopportunity to write to me, or perhaps the Miscarriage of your\r\nLetters, is certainly a Misfortune to me, for the Receipt of them\r\nwould serve to alleviate my Cares. I have wrote you several times\r\nsince my Arrival here. In my last I gave you a particular Account\r\nof our latest Intelligence from England, which I [rely upon;] it\r\ncame from a Correspondent whose [Connections] have always\r\nafforded him the Opportunity of giving me the earliest and best\r\nAdvice.\r\n\r\nThe Affairs of our Country are at this Moment in the most\r\ncritical Scituation. Every Wheel seems now to be in Motion. I am\r\nso fully satisfied in the Justice of our Cause, that I can\r\nconfidently as well as devoutly pray, that the righteous Disposer\r\nof all things would succeed our Enterprises. If he suffers us to\r\nbe defeated in any or all of them I shall believe it to be for\r\nthe most wise and gracious Purposes and shall heartily acquiesce\r\nin the Divine Disposal. It is an unspeakable Consolation to an\r\nActor upon the publick Stage, when, after the most careful\r\nRetrospect, he can satisfy himself that he has had in his View no\r\nprivate or selfish Considerations, but has ever been [guided] by\r\nthe pure Motive of serving his Country, and delivering it from\r\nthe rapacious Hand of a Tyrant.\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly anxious to hear from our Northern and Eastern\r\nArmies. Much, I was going to say, All depends upon the military\r\nVirtue of Schuyler and Arnold. If they do what they can, it will\r\nbe all in Reason their Country ought to expect from them. Mortals\r\ncannot command Success. Should they succeed, (God grant they\r\nmay!) the plan which our Enemies have laid for the Destruction of\r\nthe New England Colonies, and in the Event of all the rest, will\r\nbe defeated.\r\n\r\nPray, my dear, let me hear from you soon. I am greatly concernd\r\nfor your Security & happiness, and that of my Family. I wrote to\r\nmy Daughter yesterday. Pay my particular Regards to Sister Polly.\r\nTell my Domesticks individually that I remember them. I pray God\r\nto bless you all.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1A letter by Adams, on the same date, to William Heath has\r\nrecently been printed in Collections of\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, 7th ser., vol. iv., pp. 6, 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 119-122; the\r\ntext is in Force, American Archives, 4th ser., vol. iii., p.\r\n1248.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29, 1775.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI wrote to you a few days ago by young Mr. Brown, and then\r\nacknowledged your favour of the 9th instant.\r\n\r\nYou tell me that a committee of both houses of assembly is\r\nappointed to bring in a militia bill. I am of your opinion, that\r\nthis matter requires great attention, and I wish with you to see\r\nour militia formed not only into battalions, but also brigades.\r\nBut should we not be cautious of putting them under the direction\r\nof the generals of the continent, at least until such a\r\nlegislative shall be established over all America, as every\r\ncolony shall consent to?\r\n\r\nThe continental army is very properly under the direction of the\r\ncontinental congress. Possibly, if ever such a legislative should\r\nbe formed, it may be proper that the whole military power in\r\nevery Colony should be under its absolute direction. Be that as\r\nit may, will it not till then be prudent that the militia of each\r\ncolony should be and remain under the sole direction of its own\r\nlegislative, which is and ought to be the sovereign and\r\nuncontrollable power within its own limits or territory? I hope\r\nour militia will always be prepared to aid the forces of the\r\ncontinent in this righteous opposition to tyranny. But this ought\r\nto be done upon an application to the government of the colony.\r\nYour militia is your natural strength, which ought under your own\r\ndirection to be employed for your own safety and protection. It\r\nis a misfortune to a colony to become the seat of war. It is\r\nalways dangerous to the liberties of the people to have an army\r\nstationed among them, over which they have no control. There is\r\nat present a necessity for it; the continental army is kept up\r\nwithin our colony, most evidently for our immediate security. But\r\nit should be remembered that history affords abundant instances\r\nof established armies making themselves the masters of those\r\ncountries, which they were designed to protect. There may be no\r\ndanger of this at present, but it should be a caution not to\r\ntrust the whole military strength of a colony in the hands of\r\ncommanders independent of its established legislative.\r\n\r\nIt is now in the power of our assembly to establish many\r\nwholesome laws and regulations, which could not be done under the\r\nformer administration of government. Corrupt men may be kept out\r\nof places of public trust; the utmost circumspection I hope will\r\nbe used in the choice of men for public officers. It is to be\r\nexpected that some who are void of the least regard to the\r\npublic, will put on the appearance and even speak boldly the\r\nlanguage of patriots, with the sole purpose of gaining the\r\nconfidence of the public, and securing the loaves and fishes for\r\nthemselves or their sons or other connexions. Men who stand\r\ncandidates for public posts, should be critically traced in their\r\nviews and pretensions, and though we would despise mean and base\r\nsuspicion, there is a degree of jealousy which is absolutely\r\nnecessary in this degenerate state of mankind, and is indeed at\r\nall times to be considered as a political virtue. It is in your\r\npower also to prevent a plurality of places incompatible with\r\neach other being vested in the same persons. This our patriots\r\nhave loudly and very justly complained of in time past, and it\r\nwill be an everlasting disgrace to them if they suffer the\r\npractice to continue. Care I am informed is taking to prevent the\r\nevil with as little inconvenience as possible, but it is my\r\nopinion that the remedy ought to be deep and thorough.\r\n\r\nAfter all, virtue is the surest means of securing the public\r\nliberty. I hope you will improve the golden opportunity of\r\nrestoring the ancient purity of principles and manners in our\r\ncountry. Every thing that we do, or ought to esteem valuable,\r\ndepends upon it. For freedom or slavery, says an admired writer,\r\nwill prevail in a country according as the disposition and\r\nmanners of the inhabitants render them fit for the one or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nP.S. Nov. 4th. Yesterday the colours of the 7th regiment were\r\npresented to the Congress. They were taken at Fort Chamblee; the\r\ngarrison surrendered prisoners of war to Major Brown of the\r\nMassachusetts forces, with one hundred and twenty-four barrels of\r\ngunpowder! May heaven grant us further success.1\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1In the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library, is the draft of a\r\nletter, endorsed as to James Warren, the body of which is almost\r\nidentical with the foregoing.

I may venture to tell you one of our\r\nResolutions which in the Nature of it must be immediately made\r\npublick, and that it is to recommend to our Sister Colony of N\r\nHampshire to exercise Government in such a form as they shall\r\njudge necessary for the preservation of peace and good order,\r\nduring the continuance of the present Contest with Britain. This\r\nI would not have you mention abroad till you see it published or\r\nhear it publickly talkd of. The Government of the N England\r\nColonies I suppose will soon be nearly on the same Footing, and I\r\nam of opinion that it; will not be long before every Colony will\r\nsee the Necessity of setting up Government within themselves for\r\nreasons that appear to me to be obvious.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Congress was presented with the Colors of the 7th\r\nRegiment taken at Fort Chamblee which was a few days ago\r\nsurrendered to Major Brown--ONE HUNDRED & TWENTY FOUR BARRILS OF\r\nGUN POWDER--May Heaven grant us further success. I am\r\n\r\nYour affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA, Novr 7th 1775\r\n\r\nMY DEAR\r\n\r\nMy last Letter to you I sent by young Mr Gowen Brown who left\r\nthis place about a fortnight ago. I know not how many I have\r\nwritten. I wish you would send me the Dates of those you have\r\nreceivd, in your next.\r\n\r\nMy Son informs me in a late Letter, that you were about removing\r\nto little Cambridge. I am exceedingly pleasd with it, because I\r\nam sure you could not be comfortable in your house at Dedham in\r\nthe cold Season. When we shall return to our Habitation in\r\nBoston, if ever, is uncertain. The Barbarity of our Enemies in\r\nthe Desolations they have wantonly made at Falmouth and\r\nelsewhere, is a Presage of what will probably befall that Town\r\nwhich has so long endur'd the Rage of a merciless Tyrant. It has\r\ndisgracd the Name of Britain, and added to the Character of the\r\nMinistry, another indelible Mark of Infamy. We must be content to\r\nsuffer the Loss of all things in this Life, rather than tamely\r\nsurrender the publick Liberty. The Eyes of the People of Britain\r\nseem to be fast closed; if they should ever be opened they will\r\nrejoyce, and thank the Americans for resisting a Tyranny which is\r\nmanifestly intended to overwhelm them and the whole British\r\nEmpire. Righteous Heaven will surely smile on a Cause so\r\nrighteous as ours is, and our Country, if it does its Duty will\r\nsee an End to its Oppressions. Whether I shall live to rejoyce\r\nwith the Friends of Liberty and Virtue, my fellow Laborers in the\r\nCommon Cause, is a Matter of no Consequence. I will endeavor by\r\nGods Assistance, to act my little part well--to approve my self\r\nto Him, and trust every thing which concerns me to his all-\r\ngracious Providence.\r\n\r\nThe Newspapers will give you an Account of the Surrender of the\r\nGarrison at Fort Chambly to Major Brown of the Massachusetts. The\r\nColors of the 7th Regiment were taken there and were brought to\r\nthe Congress on Fryday last.\r\n\r\nI wrote to my Daughter not long ago. I hope she has receivd the\r\nLetter. Remember me to her and to Sister Polly and all the other\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nYou will believe, my dear Betsy, without the Formality of my\r\nrepeating it to you, that I am, most affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n[Proceedings of Massachusetts Historical Society, 1st ser., vol.\r\nxii., pp. 226, 227.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA. Nov. 16. 1775.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I embrace this opportunity of writing to you by your son,\r\nwhose unexpected arrival from London the last week gave me much\r\npleasure. He seems in a great degree to have recovered his\r\nhealth; & I dare say it will be still more satisfactory to you to\r\nfind, that he is warmly attached to the Rights of his Country &\r\nof mankind. Give me leave to congratulate you, & also to express\r\nto you the joy I feel on another occasion; which is, that your\r\nown health is so far restored to you, as to enable you again, &\r\nat so important a crisis, to aid our Country with your council.\r\nFor my own part, I had even buried you, though I had not forgot\r\nyou. I thank God who had disappointed our fears; & it is my\r\nardent prayer that your health may be perfectly restored & your\r\neminent usefulness long continued.\r\n\r\nWe live, my Dear Sir, in an important age--an age in which we are\r\ncalled to struggle hard in support of the public Liberty. The\r\nconflict, I am satisfied, will the next spring be more severe\r\nthan ever. The Petition of Congress has been treated with\r\ninsolent contempt. I cannot conceive that there is any room to\r\nhope from the virtuous efforts of the people of Britain. They\r\nseem to be generally unprincipled and fitted for the yoke of\r\narbitrary power. The opposition of the few is feeble and languid-\r\n-while the Tyrant is flushed with expectations from his fleets &\r\narmies, & has, I am told, explicitly declared, that \"Let the\r\nconsequences be what they may, it is his UNALTERABLE\r\ndetermination, to COMPEL the colonists to absolute obedience.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of the British Court, as I was well informed the last\r\nwinter, was, to take possession of New York, make themselves\r\nmasters of Hudson's River & the Lakes, cut off all communication\r\nbetween the Northern & Southern Colonies, & employ the Canadians\r\nupon whom they greatly relied, in distressing the frontiers of\r\nNew England. Providence has smiled upon our northern expedition.\r\nAlready St. Johns is reduced, & if we gain the possession of all\r\nCanada this winter, of which there is a fair prospect, their\r\ndesign, so far as it respects this part of their plan, will be\r\ntotally frustrated.\r\n\r\nI will not further trespass upon your time. If you can find\r\nleisure, a letter from you will exceedingly oblige me, for you\r\nmay believe me when I assure you that I am with the greatest\r\nesteem--\r\n\r\nYour Friend and very humble Servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES OTIS.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a certified copy is in\r\nthe Massachusetts Archives, 194: 160; and a text is in Force,\r\nAmerican Archives, 4th ser., vol. iii, p. 1654, and in Acts and\r\nResolves of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, vol v., pp. 524,\r\n525.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Nov 23 1775\r\n\r\nSIR/\r\n\r\nHaving maturely considerd your Letter of the 11th of Novr written\r\nin the Name & by order of the Honb the Council of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay & directed to the Delegates of that Colony,2\r\nand consulted with my Colleagues3 thereon, I beg Leave to offer\r\nit as my opinion, that the Resolve of Congress passed on the 9th\r\nof June last relative to establishing Civil Government must be\r\nsuperseeded by the subsequent resolve of the 3 of July following\r\nso far as they appear to militate with each other. By the last of\r\nthese Resolves the Conventions, or Assemblies of the several\r\nColonies annually elective are at their Discretion either to\r\nadopt the Method pointed out for the regulation of their Militia\r\nin whole or in part or to continue their former Regulations as\r\nthey on Consideration of all Circumstances shall think fit; It\r\nseems manifest therefore that the Honbl Council are under no\r\nrestraint from yielding to the Honbl House a Voice . . . . them\r\nin the Choice of the Militia officers in the Colony.\r\n\r\nI am prevaild upon to believe that this is the Sense of the\r\nCongress because they have lately recommended to the Colony of\r\nNew Hampshire to set up & exercise Government in such form as\r\nthey shall judge most conducive to the promotion of peace & good\r\norder among themselves--without Restriction of any kind.\r\n\r\nAs the Hon Board have been pleasd to direct us to give our\r\nopinion either with or without consulting our Brethren of the\r\nCongress as we shall judge best, I hope I shall be justified in\r\ndeclining on my part to have the Matter laid before Congress for\r\nReasons which were of Weight in my own Mind; and indeed I am of\r\nopinion that the Congress would not chuse to take any order of\r\nthat kind, they having constantly declind to determine on any\r\nMatter which concerns the internal Police of either of the united\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nIt is my most ardent Wish that a cordial Agreement between the\r\ntwo Houses may ever take place, and more especially in the\r\nEstablishment of the Militia, upon which the Safety of the Colony\r\nso greatly depends.\r\n\r\nI am with all due regards to the Honbl Board,\r\n\r\nSir, your most humble Servant,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Addressed as President of the Council of Massachusetts Bay.\r\n2The words \"in the Continental Congress\" were stricken from the\r\ndraft.\r\n3Originally \"Brethren.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Decr 26 1775\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI have receivd your obliging Letter of the 5th Instt by Fessenden\r\nfor which I am very thankful to you. The present Government of\r\nour Colony, you tell me, is not considerd as permanent. This\r\naffords the strongest Motive to improve the Advantages of it,\r\nwhile it continues. May not Laws be made and Regulations\r\nestablishd under this Government, the salutary Effects of which\r\nthe People shall be so convincd of from their own Experience, as\r\nnever hereafter to suffer them to be repeald or alterd. But what\r\nother Change is expected? Certainly the People do not already\r\nhanker after the Onions & the Garlick! They cannot have so soon\r\nforgot the Tyranny of their late Governors, who, being dependent\r\nupon and the mere Creatures of a Minister of State, and\r\nsubservient his Inclinations, have FORBID them to make such Laws\r\nas would have been beneficial to them or to repeal those that\r\nwere not. But, I find EVERY WHERE some Men, who are affraid of a\r\nfree Government, lest it should be perverted, and made Use of as\r\na Cloke for Licenciousness. The fear of the Peoples abusing their\r\nLiberty is made an Argument against their having the Enjoyment of\r\nit; as if any thing were so much to be dreaded by Mankind as\r\nSlavery. But the Bearer Mr Bromfield, of whose Departure I did\r\nnot know, till a few Minutes past, is waiting. I can therefore\r\nsay no more at present but that I am,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\nMr Bromfield who went in a Stage Coach, set off before I could\r\nclose my Letter. I shall therefore forward it by the Post or any\r\nother Conveyance that may next offer. Your last Letter informd me\r\nthat \"the late Conduct of the _______ had weakned that Confidence\r\n& Reverence necessary to give a well disposd Government its full\r\noperation and Effect.\" I am sorry for it; and presume it is not\r\nto be imputed to a fault in the Institution of that order but a\r\nMistake in the Persons of whom it is composd. All Men are fond of\r\nPower. It is difficult for us to be prevaild upon to believe that\r\nwe possess more than belongs to us. Even publick Bodies of men\r\nlegally constituted are too prone to covet more Power than the\r\nPublick hath judgd it safe to entrust them with. It is happy when\r\ntheir Power is not only subject to Controul while it is exercisd,\r\nbut frequently reverts into the hands of the People from whom it\r\nis derivd, and to whom Men in Power ought for ever to be\r\naccountable. That venerable Assembly, the Senate of Areopagus in\r\nAthens, whose Proceedings were so eminently upright and impartial\r\nthat we are told, even \"foreign States, when any Controversies\r\nhappend among them, would voluntarily submit to their Decisions,\"\r\n\"not only their Determinations might be called into Question and\r\nif need was, retracted by an Assembly of the People, but\r\nthemselves too, if they exceeded the due Bounds of Moderation\r\nwere liable to account for it.\" At present our Council as well as\r\nour House of Representatives are annually elective. Thus far they\r\nare accountable to the people, as they are lyable for Misbehavior\r\nto be discarded; but this is not a sufficient Security to the\r\nPeople unless they are themselves VIRTUOUS. If we wish for\r\n\"another Change,\" must it not be a Change of Manners? If the\r\nyouth are carefully educated--If the Principles of Morality are\r\nstrongly inculcated on the Minds of the People--the End and\r\nDesign of Government clearly understood and the Love of our\r\nCountry the ruling Passion, uncorrupted Men will then be chosen\r\nfor the representatives of the People. These will elect Men of\r\ndistinguishd Worth to sit at the Council Board, and in time we\r\nmay hope, that in the purity of their Manners, the Wisdom of\r\ntheir Councils, and the Justice of their Determinations our\r\nSenate may equal that of Athens, which was said to be \"the most\r\nsacred and venerable Assembly in all Greece.\" I confess, I have a\r\nstrong desire that our Colony should excell in Wisdom and Virtue.\r\nIf this proceeds from Pride, is it not . . . . . . Pride? I am\r\nwilling that the same Spirit of Emulation may pervade every one\r\nof the Confederated Colonies. But I am calld off and must\r\nconclude with again assuring you that I am, with the most\r\nfriendly Regards to Mrs Warren, very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegina Azucena\r\nrazucena@gis.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 125-127; a\r\ntext is in Force, American Archives, 4th ser., vol. iv., p. 541;\r\nand a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Jan. 2, 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour very acceptable letter of the 13th of December is now before\r\nme. Our opinions of the necessity of keeping the military power\r\nunder the direction and control of the legislative, I always\r\nthought were alike. It was far from my intention in my letter to\r\nyou on the subject, to attempt the correcting any imagined errour\r\nin your judgment, but rather shortly to express my own\r\napprehensions at this time, when it is become necessary to\r\ntolerate that power, which is always formidable, and has so often\r\nproved fatal to the liberties of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction to be informed, that the members\r\nof the house of representatives are possessed of so warm a spirit\r\nof patriotism, as that \"an enemy to America may as well attempt\r\nto scale the regions of bliss, as to insinuate himself into their\r\nfavour.\" Whatever kind of men may be denominated enemies to their\r\ncountry, certainly he is a very injudicious friend to it, who\r\ngives his suffrage for any man to fill a public office, merely\r\nbecause he is rich; and yet you tell me there are recent\r\ninstances of this in our government. I confess it mortifies me\r\ngreatly. The giving such a preference to riches is both\r\ndishonourable and dangerous to a government. It is indeed equally\r\ndangerous to promote a man to a place of public trust only\r\nbecause he wants bread, but I think it is not so dishonourable;\r\nfor men may be influenced to the latter from the feelings of\r\nhumanity, but the other argues a base, degenerate, servile temper\r\nof mind. I hope our country will never see the time, when either\r\nriches or the want of them will be the leading considerations in\r\nthe choice of public officers. Whenever riches shall be deemed a\r\nnecessary qualification, ambition as well as avarice will prompt\r\nmen most earnestly to thirst for them, and it will be commonly\r\nsaid, as in ancient times of degeneracy,\r\n\r\nQuaerenda pecunia primum est,\r\nVirtus post nummos.\r\n\r\n\"Get money, money still,\r\nAnd then let virtue follow if she will.\"\r\n\r\nI am greatly honoured, if my late letter has been acceptable to\r\nthe house. I hope the militia bill, to which that letter\r\nreferred, is completed to the satisfaction of both houses of the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nThe account you give me of the success our people meet with in\r\nthe manufacture of salt-petre is highly pleasing to me. I\r\nprocured of a gentleman in the colony of New-York, the plan of a\r\npowder mill, which I lately sent to Mr. Revere. I hope it may be\r\nof some use.\r\n\r\nI have time at present only to request you to write to me by the\r\npost, and to assure that I am\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLVES OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.\r\nJANUARY 5, 1776.1\r\n\r\n[W.

Frothingham,\r\nRise of the Republic, p. 470.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Jany 7 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--\r\n\r\nI verily believe the Letters I write to you are three, to one I\r\nreceive from you--however I consider the Multiplicity of Affairs\r\nyou must attend to in your various Departments, and am willing to\r\nmake due Allowance. Your last is dated the 19th of December. It\r\ncontains a List of very important Matters lying before the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am much pleased to find that there is an End\r\nto the Contest between the two Houses concerning the\r\nEstablishment of the Militia--and that you are in hopes of making\r\nan effectual Law for that Purpose. It is certainly of the last\r\nConsequence to a free Country that the Militia, which is its\r\nnatural Strength, should be kept upon the most advantageous\r\nFooting. A standing Army, however necessary it may be at some\r\ntimes, is always dangerous to the Liberties of the People.\r\nSoldiers are apt to consider themselves as a Body distinct from\r\nthe rest of the Citizens. They have their Arms always in their\r\nhands. Their Rules and their Discipline is severe. They soon\r\nbecome attachd to their officers and disposd to yield implicit\r\nObedience to their Commands. Such a Power should be watchd with a\r\njealous Eye. I have a good Opinion of the principal officers of\r\nour Army. I esteem them as Patriots as well as Soldiers. But if\r\nthis War continues, as it may for years yet to come, we know not\r\nwho may succeed them. Men who have been long subject to military\r\nLaws and inured to military Customs and Habits, may lose the\r\nSpirit and Feeling of Citizens. And even Citizens, having been\r\nused to admire the Heroism which the Commanders of their own Army\r\nhave displayd, and to look up to them as their Saviors may be\r\nprevaild upon to surrender to them those Rights for the\r\nprotection of which against Invaders they had employd and paid\r\nthem. We have seen too much of this Disposition among some of\r\nour Countrymen. The Militia is composd of free Citizens. There is\r\ntherefore no Danger of their making use of their Power to the\r\ndestruction of their own Rights, or suffering others to invade\r\nthem. I earnestly wish that young Gentlemen of a military Genius\r\n(& many such I am satisfied there are in our Colony) might be\r\ninstructed in the Art of War, and at the same time taught the\r\nPrinciples of a free Government, and deeply impressd with a Sense\r\nof the indispensible Obligation which every member is under to\r\nthe whole Society. These might be in time fit for officers in the\r\nMilitia, and being thorowly acquainted with the Duties of\r\nCitizens as well as soldiers, might Command of our Army at such\r\ntimes as Necessity might require so dangerous a Body to exist.\r\n\r\nI am glad that your Attention is turnd so much to the Importation\r\nof Powder & that the manufacture of Salt-petre is in so\r\nflourishing a way. I cannot think you are restraind from\r\nexporting fish to Spain, by the resolve of Congress. I will make\r\nmyself more certain by recurring to our Records when the\r\nSecretary returns tomorrow, he being at this time (6 o'clock P.\r\nM.) at his House three miles from Town; and I will inform you by\r\na Postscript to this Letter, or by another Letter p Post. I have\r\nthe Pleasure to acquaint you that five Tons of Powder CERTAINLY\r\narrivd at Egg harbour the Night before last besides two Tons in\r\nthis River--a part of it is consignd to the Congress--the rest is\r\nprivate property, partly belonging to Mr Thos Boylston and partly\r\nto a Gentleman in this City. Congress has orderd the whole to be\r\npurchasd for publick Use. We are also informd that 6 Tons more\r\narrivd a few days ago in New York which I believe to be true. But\r\nbetter still a Vessel is certainly arrivd in this River with\r\nbetween 50 & 6o Tons of Salt petre. This I suppose will give you\r\nmore Satisfaction for the present than telling you Congress News\r\nas you request.\r\n\r\nYou ask me \"When you are to hear of our Confederation?\" I answer,\r\nwhen some Gentlemen (to use an Expression of a Tory) shall \"feel\r\nmore bold.\" You know it was formerly a Complaint in our Colony,\r\nthat there was a timid kind of Men who perpetually hinderd the\r\nprogress of those who would fain run in the path of Virtue and\r\nGlory. I find wherever I am that Mankind are alike variously\r\nclassd. I can discern the Magnanimity of the Lyon the Generosity\r\nof the Horse the Fearfulness of the Deer and the CUNNING OF THE\r\nFOX--I had almost overlookd the Fidelity of the Dog. But I\r\nforbear to indulge my rambling Pen in this Way lest I should be\r\nthought chargeable with a Design to degrade the Dignity of our\r\nnature by comparing Men with Beasts. Let me just observe that I\r\nhave mentiond only the more excellent Properties that are to [be]\r\nfound among Quadrupeds. Had I suggested an Idea of the Vanity of\r\nthe Ape the Tameness of the Ox or the stupid Servility of the Ass\r\nI might have been lyable to Censure.\r\n\r\nAre you sollicitous to hear of our Confederation? I will tell\r\nyou. It is not dead but sleepeth. A Gentleman of this City told\r\nme the other day, that he could not believe the People without\r\ndoors would follow the Congress PASSIBUS AEQUIS if such Measures\r\nas SOME called spirited were pursued. It put me in mind of a\r\nFable of the high mettled horse and the dull horse. My excellenct\r\nColleague Mr J. A. can repeat this fable to you; and if the\r\nImprovement had been made of it which our very valueable Friend\r\nColl M----- proposd, you would have seen that Confederation\r\ncompleated long before this time. I do not despair of it--since\r\nour Enemies themselves are hastening it. While I am writing an\r\nExpress has come in from Baltimore in Maryland with the\r\nDeposition of Cap Horn of the Snow bird belonging to Providence.\r\nThe Deponent says that on Monday the first Instant, he being at\r\nHampton in Virginia heard a constant firing of Cannon--that he\r\nwas informd a Messenger had been sent to enquire where the firing\r\nwas who reported that the ships of War were cannonading the Town\r\nof Norfolk--that about the Middle of the Afternoon they saw the\r\nsmoke ascending from Norfolk as they supposd--that he saild\r\n[from] Hampton the Evening of the same day and the firing\r\ncontinued till the following afternoon. This will prevail more\r\nthan a long train of Reasoning to accomplish a Confederation and\r\nother Matters which I know your heart as well as mine is much set\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you that a Vessel is arrivd in Maryland having\r\nfour thousand yards of Sail Cloth--an Article which I hope will\r\nbe much in Demand in America.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA January 10 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI wrote to you the 7th Instant by Mr Anthony by the way of\r\nProvidence, and should not so soon have troubled you with another\r\nLetter, but to inform you that upon looking over the journals of\r\nCongress I find that the Recommendation of the 26th of October to\r\nexport Produce for a certain Purpose is confind to the foreign\r\nWest Indies--and the Resolution to stop all Trade till the first\r\nof March is subsequent to it. This last Resolution prevents your\r\nexporting merchantable Fish to Spain, for the purpose mentiond,\r\nwhich I am satisfied was not intended, because I am very certain\r\nthe Congress means to encourage the Importation of those\r\nnecessary Articles under the Direction of proper Persons, from\r\nevery part of the World. I design to propose to my Colleagues to\r\njoyn with me in a Motion, to extend the Recommendation so as to\r\nadmit of exporting fish to any Place besides the foreign West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, being one of a Committee to consider General\r\nWashington's last Letter to Congress, I proposd to the Committee\r\nand they readily consented to report the Inclosd Resolution1\r\nwhich were unanimously agreed to in Congress. The Committee\r\nreorted that a certain sum should be paid to Mr [Lovell] out of\r\nthe military Chest towards enabling him to remove himself & his\r\nFamily from Boston, but Precedent was objected to and the last\r\nResolve was substituted in its stead.

I flatter myself that you still place me among your\r\nFriends. I am not conscious of having done any thing to forfeit\r\nyour Regards for me and therefore I will attribute your Omission\r\nnot to a designd Neglect, but to a more probable Cause, the\r\nconstant Attention you are called upon to give to the publick\r\nAffairs of our Colony. It is for this Reason that I make myself\r\neasy, though one post arrives and one Express after another\r\nwithout a Line from you; assuring myself that your Time is\r\nemployd to much better purpose than writing to or thinking of me.\r\nI speak Truth when I tell you, that I shall be exceedingly\r\ngratified in receiving your Favors, whenever your Leisure may\r\nadmit of your suspending your Attention to Matters of greater\r\nImportance. I will add that your Letters will certainly be\r\nprofitable to me; for I shall gain that Intelligence and\r\nInstruction from them which will enable me the better to serve\r\nthe Publick in the Station I am placed in here. Give me Leave to\r\ntell you therefore, that I think it is a part of the Duty you owe\r\nto our Country to write to me as often as you can.\r\n\r\nYou have seen the MOST GRACIOUS Speech--Most Gracious! How\r\nstrangely will the Tools of a Tyrant pervert the plain Meaning of\r\nWords! It discovers, to be sure, the most BENEVOLENT & HUMANE\r\nFeelings of its Author. I have heard that he is his own Minister\r\n--that he follows the Dictates of his own Heart. If so, why\r\nshould we cast the odium of distressing Mankind upon his Minions\r\n& Flatterers only. Guilt must lie at his Door. Divine Vengeance\r\nwill fall on his head; for all-gracious Heaven cannot be an\r\nindifferent Spectator of the virtuous Struggles of this people.\r\n\r\nIn a former Letter I desired you to acquaint me of your Father's\r\nhealth and the Circumstances of the Family. I have a very great\r\nRegard for them and repeat the Request.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Boston.

I\r\nthank you heartily for the favor and shall be much obligd to you\r\nif you will write to me as often as your Leisure will admit of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt gave me pain to be informd by you, that by an unlucky\r\nCircumstance you were prevented from executing a plan, the\r\nSuccess of which would have afforded you Laurels, and probably in\r\nits immediate Effects turnd the present Crisis in favor of our\r\nCountry. We are indebted to you for your laudable Endeavor;\r\nAnother Tryal will, I hope, crown your utmost Wish.\r\n\r\nI have seen the Speech which is falsly & shamefully called MOST\r\nGRACIOUS. It breathes the most malevolent Spirit, wantonly\r\nproposes Measures calculated to distress Mankind, and determines\r\nmy Opinion of the Author of it as a Man of a wicked Heart. What a\r\npity it is, that Men are become so degenerate and servile, as to\r\nbestow Epithets which can be appropriated to the Supreme Being\r\nalone, upon Speeches & Actions which will hereafter be read &\r\nspoken of by every Man who shall profess to have a spark of\r\nVirtue & Honor, with the utmost Contempt and Detestation.--What\r\nhave we to expect from Britain, but Chains & Slavery? I hope we\r\nshall act the part which the great Law of Nature Points out. It\r\nis high time that we should assume that Character, which I am\r\nsorry to find the Capital of your Colony has publickly and\r\nexpressly disavowd. It is my most fervent prayer to Almighty God,\r\nthat he would direct and prosper the Councils of America, inspire\r\nher Armies with true Courage, shield them in every Instance of\r\nDanger and lead them on to Victory & Tryumph.\r\n\r\nI am yr affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Biddeford; a member of each provincial congress of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; a modified text is in John Adams,\r\nWorks, vol. ix., pp. 371-373, and a draft is in the Lenox\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Jany 15 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nAltho I have at present but little Leisure, I can not omit\r\nwriting you a few Lines by this Express.\r\n\r\nI have seen certain Instructions which were given by the Capital\r\nof the Colony of New Hampshire to its Delegates in their\r\nprovincial Convention,1 the Spirit of which I am not altogether\r\npleasd with. There is one part of them at least, which I think\r\ndiscovers a Timidity which is unbecoming a People oppressd and\r\ninsulted as they are, and who at their own request have been\r\nadvisd & authorizd by Congress to set up and exercise Government\r\nin such form as they should judge most conducive to their own\r\nHappiness. It is easy to understand what they mean when they\r\nspeak of \"perfecting a form of Govt STABLE and PERMANENT\"-They\r\nindeed explain themselves by saying that they \"SHOULD PREFER THE\r\nGOVT OF CONGRESS, (their provincial Convention) till quieter\r\ntimes.\" The Reason they assign for it, I fear, will be considerd\r\nas showing a Readiness to condescend to the Humours of their\r\nEnemies, and their publickly expressly & totally disavowing\r\nIndependency either on the Nation or THE MAN who insolently &\r\nperseveringly demands the Surrender of their Liberties with the\r\nBayonet pointed at their Breasts may be construed to argue a\r\nServility & Baseness of Soul for which Language doth not afford\r\nan Epithet. It is by indiscrete Resolutions and Publications that\r\nthe Friends of America have too often given occasion to their\r\nEnemies to injure her Cause. I hope however that the Town of\r\nPortsmouth doth not in this Instance speak the Sense of that\r\nColony. I wish, if it be not too late, that you would write your\r\nSentiments of the Subject to our worthy Friend Mr L------ who I\r\nsuppose is now in Portsmouth.--If that Colony should take a wrong\r\nStep, I fear it would wholly defeat a Design which, I confess I\r\nhave much at heart.\r\n\r\nA motion was made in Congress the other Day to the following\r\npurpose--that whereas we had been chargd with aiming at\r\nIndependency, a Comte should be appointed to explain to the\r\nPeople at large the Principles & Grounds of our Opposition &c.\r\nThe Motion alarmd me. I thought Congress had already been\r\nexplicit enough, & was apprehensive that we might get our selves\r\nupon dangerous Ground. Some of us prevaild so far as to have the\r\nMatter postpond but could not prevent the assigning a Day to\r\nconsider it.--I may perhaps have been wrong in opposing this\r\nMotion, and I ought the rather to suspect it, because the\r\nMajority of your Colony as well as of the Congress were of a\r\ndifferent Opinion.\r\n\r\nI had lately some free Conversation with an eminent Gentleman\r\nwhom you well know, and whom your Portia, in one of her Letters,\r\nadmired if I recollect right, for his EXPRESSIVE SILENCE, about a\r\nConfederation--A Matter which our much valued Friend Coll W------\r\nis very sollicitous to have compleated. We agreed that it must\r\nsoon be brought on, & that if all the Colonies could not come\r\ninto it, it had better be done by those of them that inclind to\r\nit. I told him that I would endeavor to unite the New England\r\nColonies in confederating, if NONE of the rest would joyn in it.\r\nHe approvd of it, and said, if I succeeded, he would cast in his\r\nLot among us.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nJany 16th\r\n\r\nAs this Express did not sett off yesterday, according to my\r\nExpectation, I have the Opportunity of acquainting you that\r\nCongress has just receivd a Letter from General Washington\r\ninclosing the Copy of an Application of our General Assembly to\r\nhim to order payment to four Companies stationd at Braintree\r\nWeymouth & Hingham. The General says they were never regimented,\r\n& he can not comply with the Request of the Assembly without the\r\nDirection of Congress. A Come is appointed to consider the\r\nLetter, of which I am one. I fear there will be a Difficulty, and\r\ntherefore I shall endeavor to prevent a Report on this part of\r\nthe Letter, unless I shall see a prospect of justice being done\r\nto the Colony, till I can receive from you authentick Evidence of\r\nthose companies having been actually employed by the continental\r\nofficers, as I conceive they have been, in the Service of the\r\nContinent. I wish you wd inform me whether the two Companies\r\nstationd at Chelsea & Malden were paid out of the Continents\r\nChest. I suppose they were, and if so, I cannot see Reason for\r\nany Hesitation about the paymt of these. I wish also to know how\r\nmany Men our Colony is at the Expence of maintaining for the\r\nDefence of its Sea Coasts. Pray let me have some Intelligence\r\nfrom you, of the Colony which we represent. You are sensible of\r\nthe Danger it has frequently been in of suffering greatly for\r\nWant of regular information.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf. New Hampshire Provincial Papers, vol. vii., pp. 701, 702.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams,1 vol. ii., pp. 360-363.]\r\n\r\n[February 3, 1776.]\r\n\r\nWhen the little pamphlet, entitled \" Common Sense,\" first made\r\nits appearance in favor of that so often abjured idea of\r\nindependence upon Great Britain, I was informed that no less than\r\nthree gentlemen of respectable abilities were engaged to answer\r\nit. As yet, I have seen nothing which directly pretends to\r\ndispute a single position of the author. The oblique essay in\r\nHumphrey's paper, and solemn \"Testimony of the Quakers,\" however\r\nintended, having offered nothing to the purpose, I shall take\r\nleave to examine this important question with all candor and\r\nattention, and submit the result to my much interested country.\r\n\r\nDependence of one man or state upon another is either absolute or\r\nlimited by some certain terms of agreement. The dependence of\r\nthese Colonies, which Great Britain calls constitutional, as\r\ndeclared by acts of Parliament, is absolute. If the contrary of\r\nthis be the bugbear so many have been disclaiming against, I\r\ncould wish my countrymen would consider the consequence of so\r\nstupid a profession. If a limited dependence is intended, I would\r\nbe much obliged to any one who will show me the Britannico-\r\nAmerican Magna Charta, wherein the terms of our limited\r\ndependence are precisely stated. If no such thing can be found,\r\nand absolute dependence be accounted inadmissible, the sound we\r\nare squabbling about has certainly no determinate meaning. If we\r\nsay we mean that kind of dependence we acknowledged at and before\r\nthe year 1763, I answer, vague and uncertain laws, and more\r\nespecially constitutions, are the very instruments of slavery.\r\nThe Magna Charta of England was very explicit, considering the\r\ntime it was formed, and yet much blood was spilled in disputes\r\nconcerning its meaning.\r\n\r\nBesides the danger of an indefinite dependence upon an\r\nundetermined power, it might be worth while to consider what the\r\ncharacters are on whom we are so ready to acknowledge ourselves\r\ndependent. The votaries of this idol tell us, upon the good\r\npeople of our mother country, whom they represent as the most\r\njust, humane, and affectionate friends we can have in the world.\r\nWere this true, it were some encouragement; but who can pretend\r\nignorance, that these just and humane friends are as much under\r\nthe tyranny of men of a reverse character as we should be could\r\nthese miscreants gain their ends? I disclaim any more than a\r\nmutual dependence on any man or number of men on earth; but an\r\nindefinite dependence upon a combination of men who have, in the\r\nface of the sun, broken through the most solemn covenants,\r\ndebauched the hereditary, and corrupted the elective guardians of\r\nthe people's rights; who have, in fact, established an absolute\r\ntyranny in Great Britain and Ireland, and openly declared\r\nthemselves competent to bind the Colonies in all cases\r\nwhatsoever,--I say, indefinite dependence on such a combination\r\nof usurping innovators is evidently as dangerous to liberty, as\r\nfatal to civil and social happiness, as any one step that could\r\nbe proposed even by the destroyer of men. The utmost that the\r\nhonest party in Great Britain can do is to warn us to avoid this\r\ndependence at all hazards. Does not even a Duke of Grafton\r\ndeclare the ministerial measures illegal and dangerous? And shall\r\nAmerica, no way connected with this Administration, press our\r\nsubmission to such measures and reconciliation to the authors of\r\nthem? Would not such pigeon-hearted wretches equally forward the\r\nrecall of the Stuart family and establishment of Popery\r\nthroughout Christendom, did they consider the party in favor of\r\nthose loyal measures the strongest? Shame on the men who can\r\ncourt exemption from present trouble and expense at the price of\r\ntheir posterity's liberty! The honest party in England cannot\r\nwish for the reconciliation proposed. It is as unsafe to them as\r\nto us, and they thoroughly apprehend it. What check have they now\r\nupon the Crown, and what shadow of control can they pretend, when\r\nthe Crown can command fifteen or twenty millions a year which\r\nthey have nothing to say to? A proper proportion of our commerce\r\nis all that can benefit any good man in Britain or Ireland; and\r\nGod forbid we should be so cruel as to furnish bad men with the\r\npower to enslave both Britain and America. Administration has now\r\nfairly dissevered the dangerous tie. Execrated will he be by the\r\nlatest posterity who again joins the fatal cord!\r\n\r\n\"But,\" say the puling, pusillanimous cowards, \"we shall be\r\nsubject to a long and bloody war, if we declare independence.\" On\r\nthe contrary, I affirm it the only step that can bring the\r\ncontest to a speedy and happy issue. By declaring independence we\r\nput ourselves on a footing for an equal negotiation. Now we are\r\ncalled a pack of villainous rebels, who, like the St. Vincent's\r\nIndians, can expect nothing more than a pardon for our lives, and\r\nthe sovereign favor respecting freedom, and property to be at the\r\nKing's will. Grant, Almighty God, that I may be numbered with the\r\ndead before that sable day dawns on North America.\r\n\r\nAll Europe knows the illegal and inhuman treatment we have\r\nreceived from Britons. All Europe wishes the haughty Empress of\r\nthe Main reduced to a more humble deportment. After herself has\r\nthrust her Colonies from her, the maritime powers cannot be such\r\nidiots as to suffer her to reduce them to a more absolute\r\nobedience of her dictates than they were heretofore obliged to\r\nyield. Does not the most superficial politician know, that while\r\nwe profess ourselves the subjects of Great Britain, and yet hold\r\narms against her, they have a right to treat us as rebels, and\r\nthat, according to the laws of nature and nations, no other state\r\nhas a right to interfere in the dispute? But, on the other hand,\r\non our declaration of independence, the maritime states, at\r\nleast, will find it their interest (which always secures the\r\nquestion of inclination) to protect a people who can be so\r\nadvantageous to them. So that those shortsighted politicians, who\r\nconclude that this step will involve us in slaughter and\r\ndevastation, may plainly perceive that no measure in our power\r\nwill so naturally and effectually work our deliverance. The\r\nmotion of a finger of the Grand Monarch would produce as gentle a\r\ntemper in the omnipotent British minister as appeared in the\r\nManilla ransom and Falkland Island affairs. From without,\r\ncertainly, we have everything to hope, nothing to fear. From\r\nwithin, some tell us that the Presbyterians, if freed from the\r\nrestraining power of Great Britain, would overrun the peaceable\r\nQuakers in this government. For my own part, I despise and detest\r\nthe bickerings of sectaries, and am apprehensive of no trouble\r\nfrom that quarter, especially while no peculiar honors or\r\nemoluments are annexed to either. I heartily wish too many of the\r\nQuakers did not give cause of complaint, by endeavoring to\r\ncounteract the measures of their fellow-citizens for the common\r\nsafety. If they profess themselves only pilgrims here, let them\r\nwalk through the men of this world without interfering with their\r\nactions on either side. If they would not pull down kings, let\r\nthem not support tyrants; for, whether they understand it or not,\r\nthere is, and ever has been, an essential difference in the\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nFinally, with M. de Vattel, I account a state a moral person,\r\nhaving an interest and will of its own; and I think that state a\r\nmonster whose prime mover has an interest and will in direct\r\nopposition to its prosperity and security. This position has been\r\nso clearly demonstrated in the pamphlet first mentioned in this\r\nessay, that I shall only add, if there are any arguments in favor\r\nof returning to a state of dependence on Great Britain, that is,\r\non the present Administration of Great Britain, I could wish they\r\nwere timely offered, that they may be soberly considered before\r\nthe cunning proposals of the Cabinet set all the timid, lazy, and\r\nirresolute members of the community into a clamor for peace at\r\nany rate.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Wells, at vol. ii,, pp. 349-352, prints an article entitled \" An\r\nEarnest Appeal to the People,\" and signed \"Sincerus,\"\r\nattributing the authorship to Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Feby 26 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR\r\n\r\nI have been impatiently waiting for a Letter from you. I think\r\nyour last was dated the 21st of January--you cannot do me a\r\ngreater Pleasure than by writing to me often. It is my Intention\r\nto make you a Visit as soon as the Roads which are now\r\nexcessively bad shall be settled. Perhaps it may be not before\r\nApril. I have tarried through the Winter, because I thought my\r\nself indispensably obligd so greatly to deny my self. Some of my\r\nFriends here tell me that I ought not to think of leaving this\r\nCity at so critical a Season as the Opening of the Spring, but I\r\nam happy in the return of Mr Adams with Mr Gerry and in being\r\nassured that my Absence from Duty for a short time may be\r\ndispensd with and though I am at present in a good State of\r\nHealth, the Jaunt may be necessary for the Preservation of it.\r\nWhenever I shall have the pleasure of seeing you, to me it will\r\nbe inexpressible, and I dare say our Meeting, after so long an\r\nAbsense, will not be disagreeable to you.\r\n\r\nI have nothing new to write to you. In one of your Letters you\r\ntold me that Dr C had requested that I would sometimes write you\r\non the Politicks of this place, and that he might see my Letters\r\nof that kind. Pay my due Regards to the Doctor when you see him &\r\ntell him that I can scarsely find time to write you even a Love\r\nLetter. I will however for once give you a political Anecdote. Dr\r\nSmith Provost of the College here, by the Invitation of the\r\nContinental Congress, lately deliverd a funeral Oration on the\r\ngallant General Montgomery who fell at the Walls of Quebec.\r\nCertain political Principles were thought to be interwoven with\r\nevery part of the Oration which were displeasing to the Auditory.\r\nIt was remarkd that he could not even keep their Attention. A\r\nCircle of Ladies, who had seated themselves in a convenient place\r\non purpose to see as well as hear the Orator, that they might\r\ntake every Advantage for the Indulgence of Griefe on so\r\nmelancholly an Occasion, were observd to look much disappointed\r\nand chagrind. The next day a Motion was made in Congress for\r\nrequesting a Copy for the Press. The Motion was opposd from every\r\nQuarter, and with so many Reasons that the Gentleman who made the\r\nMotion desired Leave to withdraw it. Such was the fate of that\r\nOration which is celebrated in the NEWSPAPERS of this City,\r\nperhaps by some one of the Orators Friends for I will not presume\r\nthat HE was privy to the Compliment paid to it as \"VERY ANIMATED\r\nAND PATHETICK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE March 8 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI now sit down just to acknowledge the Receipt of your favor of\r\nthe 14th of Feby, and to mention to you a Matter which considerd\r\nin it self may appear to be of small Moment but in its Effects\r\nmay be mischievous. I believe I may safely appeal to all the\r\nLetters which I have written to my Friends since I have been in\r\nthis City to vindicate my self in affirming that I have never\r\nmentiond Mr C or referrd to his Conduct in any of them, excepting\r\none to my worthy Colleague Mr A when he was at Watertown a few\r\nWeeks ago, in which I informd him of the side Mr C had taken in a\r\nvery interresting Debate; and then I only observd that he had a\r\nRight to give his opinion whenever he was prepard to form one.\r\nYet I have been told that it has been industriously reported that\r\nMr J A & my self have been secretly writing to his Prejudice and\r\nthat our Letters had operated to his being superceded. So fully\r\nperswaded were Gentlemen of the Truth of this Report, and Mr D of\r\nN Y in particular whom I have heard express a warm Affection for\r\nMr C, that he seemd scarcely willing to credit me when I\r\ncontradicted it. Whether the report and a Beliefe of it engagd\r\nthe confidential Friends of Mr C to open a charitable\r\nSubscription in support of his Character, I am not able to say.\r\nIf it was so, they ought in justice to him to have made\r\nthemselves certain of the Truth of it; for to offer Aid to the\r\nReputation of a Gentleman without a real Necessity is surely no\r\nAdvantage to it. A Letter was handed about addressed to Mr C. The\r\nContents I never saw--his Friends signd it. Other Gentlemen at\r\ntheir request also set their hands to it, perhaps with as much\r\nIndifference as a Man of Business would give a shilling to get\r\nrid of the Importunity of a Beggar. I hear it is supposd in\r\nWatertown to be an Address of Thanks from the Congress to Mr C\r\nfor his eminent Services, in which his recall from Business here\r\nis mentiond with Regret--but this is most certainly a Mistake.\r\nThe Gentlemen signd it in their private Capacity. With Submission\r\nthey should not have addressd it to another Person or publishd it\r\nto the World after the Manner of other Addressers; for if they\r\nintended it to recommend Mr C to his own Constituents, was it not\r\nhard to oblige him to blow the Trumpet himself which they had\r\nprepared to sound his Praise. But Majr Osgood is in haste. I must\r\ntherefore drop this Subject FOR THE PRESENT and conclude with\r\nassuring you that I am affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA March 10th 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI arrivd in this City from Baltimore last Saturday. Having been\r\nindisposd there so as to be obligd to keep my Chamber ten days, I\r\nwas unable to travel with my Friends, but through the Goodness of\r\nGod I have got rid of my Disorder and am in good Health. Mrs\r\nRoss, at whose House I took Lodging in Baltimore treated me with\r\ngreat Civility and Kindness and was particularly attentive to me\r\nin my Sickness, and Wadsworth is as clever a young Man, as I ever\r\nmet with. Tell Mr Collson, if you see him, he more than answers\r\nmy Expectation even from the good Character he gave me of him.\r\n\r\nI hope, my dear, that you and my Faniily enjoy a good Share of\r\nHealth. It is my constant & ardent Prayer that the best of\r\nHeavens Blessings may rest on you and on them. I lately receivd a\r\nLetter from my Son, and since I came to this Place, General\r\nMorris of New York tells me he frequently saw him at Peeks Kill,\r\nand that he behavd well. Nothing gives me greater Satisfaction\r\nthan to hear that he supports a good Reputation. I hope my\r\nFriends do not flatter me.\r\n\r\nI am greatly disappointed in not receiving your last Letter. It\r\nwas owing to the Friendship of Mr Hancock who took it up in this\r\nplace, and not expecting my Return from Baltimore so soon, he\r\nforwarded it by a careful hand who promisd him to deliver it to\r\nme there. I shall receive it in a day or two by the Post. Pray\r\nwrite to me by every opportunity and believe me to be,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\nP.

C. Ford, Writings of\r\nGeorge Washington, vol. iii., p. 103, from MS. owned by Mrs. J.\r\nS. H. Fogg.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD April 2 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI am yet indebted to you for the obliging Letter I received from\r\nyou some Months ago. The Subject of it was principally concerning\r\na young Gentleman whom I personally know, and whose Merit in my\r\nopinion intitles him to singular Notice from his Country. This\r\nmay seem like Flattery--you may be assured it is not--nor indeed\r\ndo I know how flatter. Words however are oftentimes, though\r\nspoken in Sincerity, but Wind. If I had had it in my power\r\nsubstantially to have servd that young Gentleman you would have\r\nlong ago heard from me. The Want of that opportunity causd me to\r\nlay down my pen divers times after I had even begun to write to\r\nyou--you will not therefore, I hope, construe my long Delay as\r\nthe least Want of that just Regard which I owe to you.\r\n\r\nMany Advantages arose to our Colony by the Congress adopting the\r\nArmy raisd in N Engd the last Spring but among the Misfortunes\r\nattending it this was one, namely that it being now a Continental\r\nArmy, the Gentlemen of all Colonies had a Right to and put in for\r\na Share in behalf of their Friends in filling up the various\r\noffices. By this means it was thought that military knowledge and\r\nExperience as well as the military Spirit would spread thro the\r\nColonies and besides that they would all consider themselves the\r\nmore interrested in the Success of our Army and in providing for\r\nits support. But then there was the less Room for Persons who\r\nwere well worthy of Notice in the Colonies which had first raisd\r\nthe Army. This was the Cause why many of our Friends were\r\ndiscontented who did not advert to it. When the Quarter Master\r\nwas appointed, I question whether any of your Friends knew, I am\r\nsure I did not, that the Gentleman I have referrd to sustaind\r\nthat office; there was therefore no designd Neglect of him here.\r\nMr Ms Character stood so high that no Gentleman could hesitate to\r\nput him into a place which was understood to be vacant & which he\r\nwas so well qualified to fill. The Truth is, we have never had\r\nthat Information from our Friends at Watertown of the State of\r\nthings which we have thought we had good reason to expect from\r\nthem. I do assure you I have often been made acquainted with the\r\nState of Affairs in our Colony, as well as I could from Letters\r\nshown to me by Gentlemen of other Colonies. I do not mention this\r\nwithout duly considering that the Attention of our Friends must\r\nhave been turnd to a great Variety of Business.\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate you upon the sudden and important Change\r\nof our Affairs in the Removal of the Barbarians from the Capital.\r\nWe owe our grateful Acknowledgments to him who is, as he is\r\nfrequently stiled in sacred Writ \"The Lord of Hosts\" \"The God of\r\nArmies\"--We have not yet been informd with Certainty what Course\r\nthe Enemy have steerd. I hope we shall be upon our Guard against\r\nfuture Attempts. Will not Care be taken immediately to fortify\r\nthe Harbour & thereby prevent the Entrance of Ships of War ever\r\nhereafter? But I am called to Duty and must break off abruptly.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend and be assured I am affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Braintree. A member of each provincial congress of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA April 3 1776.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI lately recd a very obliging Letter from you for which I now\r\nreturn you my hearty Thanks. I wish your Leisure would admit of\r\nyour frequently favoring me with your Thoughts of our publick\r\nAffairs. I do assure you I shall make use of them, as far as my\r\nAbility shall extend, to the Advantage of our Country. If you\r\nplease, I will employ a few Minutes in giving you my own Ideas,\r\ngrounded on the best Intelligence I have been able to obtain.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Shame and Loss attended the Measures of the\r\nBritish Court the last Summer and Fall, yet by the latest\r\nAccounts recd from our Friends in that Country, it appears that\r\nthey are determind to persevere. They then reckond (in December)\r\nupon having 20,000 Troops in America for the next Campaign. Their\r\nEstimate was thus-- 6000 in Boston--7000 to go from Ireland--3000\r\nHighlanders raising under General Frazier and the rest to be in\r\nRecruits--of the 7000 from Ireland, we are told, that 3000 were\r\nto sail for Virginia and North Carolina & were expected to be on\r\nthat Coast in March or the Beginning of April. It is probable\r\nthen that the Ministry have not quitted the Plan which they had\r\nagreed upon above a twelvemonth ago; which was, to take\r\nPossession of New York--make themselves Masters of Hudsons River\r\n& the Lakes, thereby securing Canada and the Indians--cut off all\r\nCommunication between the Colonies Northward & Southward of\r\nHudsons River, and thus to subdue the former in hopes by\r\ninstigating the Negroes to make the others an easy Prey. Our\r\nSuccess, a great Part of which they had not then heard of, it is\r\nto be hoped has renderd this Plan impracticable; yet it is\r\nprobable that the main Body of these Troops is designd to carry\r\nit into Execution, while the rest are to make a Diversion in the\r\nSouthern Colonies. Those Colonies, I think, are sufficiently\r\nprovided for. Our Safety very much depends upon our Vigilance &\r\nSuccess in N York & Canada. Our Enemies did not neglect Hudsons\r\nRiver the last year. We know that one of their Transports arrivd\r\nat N York, but Gage, seizd with a Panick orderd that & the other\r\ntransports destind for that Place, to Boston. I have ever thought\r\nit to be their favorite Plan; not only because it appeard to me\r\nto be dictated by sound Policy, but because from good\r\nIntelligence which I receivd from England the last Winter, they\r\nrevivd it after it had been broken in upon by Gage, and sent\r\nTryon to New York to remove every obstacle in the Way of landing\r\nthe Troops there, and to cooperate with Carleton in the Execution\r\nof it.--\r\n\r\nThe Kings Troops have now abandond Boston, on which I sincerely\r\ncongratulate you. We have not yet heard what Course they have\r\nsteerd. I judge for Hallifax. They may return if they hear that\r\nyou are off your Guard. Or probably they may go up St Lawrence\r\nRiver as early as the Season will admit of it. Does it not behove\r\nN England to secure her self from future Invasions, while the\r\nAttention of Congress is turnd to N York & Canada. We seem to\r\nhave the Game in our own hands; if we do not play it well,\r\nMisfortune will be the Effect of our Negligence and Folly. The\r\nBritish Court sollicited the Assistance of Russia; but we are\r\ninformd that they faild of it through the Interposition of France\r\nby the Means of Sweden. The ostensible Reason on the Part of\r\nRussia was, that there was no Cartel settled between Great\r\nBritain and America; the Want of which will make every Power\r\nreluctant in lending their Troops. France is attentive to this\r\nStruggle and wishes for a Separation of the two Countries. I am\r\nin no Doubt that she would with Chearfulness openly lend her Aid\r\nto promote it, if America would declare herself free and\r\nindependent; for I think it is easy to see what great though\r\ndifferent Effects it would have in both those Nations. Britain\r\nwould no longer have it in her Power to oppress.\r\n\r\nIs not America already independent? Why then not declare it? Upon\r\nwhom was she ever supposd to be dependent, but upon that Nation\r\nwhose most barbarous Usage of her, & that in multiplied Instances\r\nand for a long time has renderd it absurd ever to put Confidence\r\nin it, & with which she is at this time in open War. Can Nations\r\nat War be said to be dependent either upon the other? I ask then\r\nagain, why not declare for Independence? Because say some, it\r\nwill forever shut the Door of Reconciliation. Upon what Terms\r\nwill Britain be reconciled with America? If we may take the\r\nconfiscating Act of Parliamt or the Kings last Proclamation for\r\nour Rule to judge by, she will be reconciled upon our abjectly\r\nsubmitting to Tyranny, and asking and receiving Pardon for\r\nresisting it. Will this redound to the Honor or the Safety of\r\nAmerica? Surely no. By such a Reconciliation she would not only\r\nin the most shameful Manner acknowledge the Tyranny, but most\r\nwickedly, as far as would be in her Power, prevent her Posterity\r\nfrom ever hereafter resisting it.\r\n\r\nBut the Express now waits for this Letter. I must therefore break\r\noff. I will write to you again by another opportunity. Pay my\r\nRespects to the Speaker pro Temp. and tell him that I have never\r\nreceivd a Line from him since I have been in this City. My\r\nRespects are also due to Mr S P S,1 from whom I yesterday receivd\r\na kind Letter, which I shall duly acknowledge to him when I have\r\nLeisure to write. Give me Leave to assure you that I am with the\r\nmost friendly Regards for your Lady & Family very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Samuel P. Savage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH HAWLEY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE April 15 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour obliging Letter of the 1st Instt came duly to my hand. So\r\nearly as the last Winter was a twelve month past I was informd by\r\na worthy and very intelligent Friend in London, that the\r\nSubduction of the New England Colonies was the FIRST Object of\r\nour Enemies. This was to be effected, in a Manner coincident with\r\nyour Ideas, by establishing themselves on Hudsons River. They\r\nwere thereby at once to secure Canada and the Indians, give\r\nSupport and Protection to the numerous Tories in New York, supply\r\ntheir Army at Boston with Provisions from that Colony and\r\nintirely prevent the southern from affording any Aid to those\r\ninvaded Colonies. This Plan was in my opinion undoubtedly\r\ndictated by sound Policy; and it would have been put in Execution\r\nthe last Summer, had not the necessities to which Gage was reducd\r\n& his Apprehensions from our having a formidable Army before\r\nBoston, obligd him to break in upon it. They did not neglect\r\nHudsons River the last year; for we know that two of their\r\nTransports actually arrivd at New York; But these were\r\nimmediately orderd by Gage, together with the rest of the Fleet\r\nto Boston. My Friend in London whose Intelligence I have never\r\nyet found to fail, informd me the last Fall, that our Enemies did\r\nnot quit this Plan. Upon hearing that it had been thus\r\ninterrupted, they revivd it, and sent Tryon to New York to keep\r\nthe People there in good Humour and cooperate with Carleton in\r\nthe Execution of it. They reckond the last Winter upon having\r\n20,000 Troops in America for the ensuing Campaign, of which 3000\r\nwere to go to Virginia or one of the Carolinas. These last I\r\nsuppose are designd for a Diversion, while the main Body of all\r\nthe Troops they will be able to send, will be employd in\r\nexecuting their original & favorite Plan. Thus, my Friend, I am\r\nyet happy in concurring with you in Sentiments; and I shall\r\npersevere in using the small Influence I have here, agreable to\r\nyour repeated Advice, \"to prevent the Enemies establishing\r\nthemselves & making Advances on Hudson & St Lawrence Rivers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mercenary Troops have at length abandond Boston on which, I\r\nperceive, you will not allow me YET to give you joy. May I not\r\nhowever advise, that the favorable opportunity which this\r\nimportant Event, added to the Season of the year has offerd, be\r\nimprovd in fortifying the Harbour so as to render it\r\nimpracticable for the Enemies Ships to enter it hereafter. I hope\r\nthis fortunate Change of Affairs has not put you off your Guard.\r\nShould you not immediately prepare against future Invasions,\r\nwhich may be made upon you before you are aware? Your Sea Coasts\r\nmust still be defended. We shall soon realize the Destination of\r\nthe Enemies Forces. Those under the Command of General Howe will\r\nprobably remain at Hallifax till the Season of the year will\r\nadmit of their going up St Lawrence River. The Troops coming from\r\nIreland may be destind to New York & will expect to get\r\nPossession there. At least they will attempt it. A failure may\r\nlead their Views back to Boston; for I am in no Apprehensions\r\nthat they will think of subduing the Southern Colonies till they\r\nshall have first subdued those of the North. The Southern\r\nColonies, I think, are sufficiently provided for, to enable them\r\nto repell any Force that may come against them the ensuing\r\nSummer. Our Safety therefore much depends upon the Care which New\r\nEngland shall take for her own Preservation and our Vigilance and\r\nSuccess in New York and Canada. There are Forces enough already\r\nORDERD to answer all our Purposes. Our business is, to imitate\r\nour Enemies in Zeal Application & Perseverance in carrying our\r\nown Plans into Execution.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly satisfied with the Reasons you offer to show the\r\nNecessity of a publick & explicit Declaration of Independency. I\r\ncannot conceive what good Reason can be assignd against it. Will\r\nit widen the Breach? This would be a strange Question after we\r\nhave raised Armies and fought Battles with the British Troops,\r\nset up an American Navy, permitted the Inhabitants of these\r\nColonies to fit out armed Vessels to cruize on all Ships &c\r\nbelonging to any of the Inhabitants of Great Britain declaring\r\nthem the Enemies of the united Colonies, and torn into Shivers\r\ntheir Acts of Trade, by allowing Commerce subject to Regulations\r\nto be made by OUR SELVES with the People of all Countries but\r\nsuch as are Subjects of the British King. It cannot surely after\r\nall this be imagind that we consider our selves or mean to be\r\nconsiderd by others in any State but that of Independence. But\r\nmoderate Whigs are disgusted with our mentioning the Word!\r\nSensible Tories are better Politicians. THEY know, that no\r\nforeign Power can consistently yield Comfort to Rebels, or enter\r\ninto any kind of Treaty with these Colonies till they declare\r\nthemselves free and independent. They are in hopes that by our\r\nprotracting this decisive Step we shall grow weary of War; and\r\nthat for want of foreign Connections and Assistance we shall be\r\ndriven to the Necessity of acknowledging the Tyrant and\r\nsubmitting to the Tyranny. These are the Hopes and Expectations\r\nof Tories, while moderate Gentlemen are flattering themselves\r\nwith the Prospect of Reconciliation when the Commissioners that\r\nare talked of shall arrive. A mere Amusement indeed! When are\r\nthese Commissioners to arrive? Or what Terms of Reconciliation\r\nare we to expect from them that will be acceptable to the People\r\nof America? Will the King of Great Britain empower his\r\nCommissioners even to promise the Repeal of all or any of their\r\nobnoxious and oppressive Acts? Can he do it? Or if he could, has\r\nhe ever yet discoverd a Disposition which shew the least Degree\r\nof that princely virtue, Clemency? I scruple not to affirm it as\r\nmy opinion that his heart is more obdurate, and his Disposition\r\ntowards the People of America is more unrelenting and malignant\r\nthan was that of Pharaoh towards the Israelites in Egypt. But let\r\nus not be impatient. It requires Time to convince the doubting\r\nand inspire the timid. Many great Events have taken place \"since\r\nthe stopping the Courts in Berkshire\"--Events at that time\r\nunforeseen. Whether we shall ever see the Commissioners is Matter\r\nof Uncertainty. I do not, I never did expect them. If they do\r\ncome the Budget must open and it will be soon known to all\r\nwhether Reconciliation is practicable or not. If they do not come\r\nspeedily, the hopes which some Men entertain of reconciliation\r\nmust vanish. I am my dear Sir very respectfully,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA April 30 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge the Receipt of your Favor of the 18th Instant\r\nby the Post. The Ideas of Independence spread far and wide among\r\nthe Colonies. Many of the leading Men see the absurdity of\r\nsupposing that Allegiance is due to a Sovereign who has already\r\nthrown us out of his Protection. South Carolina has lately assumd\r\na new Government. The Convention of North Carolina have\r\nunanimously agreed to do the same & appointed a Committee to\r\nprepare & lay before them a proper Form. They have also revokd\r\ncertain Instructions which tied the Hands of their Delegates\r\nhere. Virginia whose Convention is to meet on the third of next\r\nmonth will follow the lead. The Body of the People of Maryland\r\nare firm. Some of the principal Members of their Convention, I am\r\ninclind to believe, are timid or lukewarm but an occurrence has\r\nlately fallen out in that Colony which will probably give an\r\nagreable Turn to their affairs. Of this I will inform you at a\r\nfuture time when I may be more particularly instructed concerning\r\nit. The lower Counties on Delaware are a small People but well\r\naffected to the Common Cause. In this populous and wealthy Colony\r\npolitical Parties run high. The News papers are full of the\r\nMatter but I think I may assure you that Common Sense, prevails\r\namong the people--a Law has lately passed in the Assembly here\r\nfor increasing the Number of Representatives and tomorrow they\r\nare to come to a Choice in this City & diverse of the Counties--\r\nby this Means it is said the representation of the Colony will be\r\nmore equal. I am told that a very popular Gentleman who is a\r\nCandidate for one of the back Counties has been in danger of\r\nlosing his Election because it was reported among the Electors\r\nthat he had declared his Mind in this City against Independence.\r\nI know the political Creed of that Gentleman. It is, so far as\r\nrelates to a Right of the British Parliament to make Laws binding\r\nthe Colonies in any Case whatever, exactly correspondent with\r\nyour own. I mention this Anecdote to give you an Idea of the\r\nJealousy of the People & their attention to this Point. The\r\nJerseys are agitating the great Question. It is with them rather\r\na Matter of Prudence whether to determine till some others have\r\ndone it before them. A Gentleman of that Colony tells me that at\r\nleast one half of them have New Engd Blood running in their\r\nVeins--be this as it may their Sentiments & Manners are I believe\r\nsimilar to those of N England. I forbear to say any thing of New\r\nYork, for I confess I am not able to form any opinion of them. I\r\nlately recd a Letter from a Friend in that Colony informing me\r\nthat they would soon come to a Question of the Expediency of\r\ntaking up Government; but to me it is uncertain what they will\r\ndo. I think they are at least as unenlightned in the Nature &\r\nImportance of our political Disputes as any one of the united\r\nColonies. I have not mentiond our little Sister Georgia; but I\r\nbelieve she is as warmly engagd in the Cause as any of us, & will\r\ndo as much as can be reasonably expected of her. I was very\r\nsollicitous the last Fall to have Governments set up by the\r\npeople in every Colony. It appears to me to be necessary for many\r\nreasons. When this is done, and I am inclind to think it will be\r\nsoon, the Colonies will feel their Independence--the Way will be\r\nprepared for a Confederation, and one Government may be formd\r\nwith the Consent of the whole--a distinct State composd of all\r\nthe Colonies with a common Legislature for great & General\r\nPurposes. This I was in hopes would have been the Work of the\r\nlast Winter. I am disappointed but I bear it tollerably well. I\r\nam disposd to believe that every thing is orderd for the best,\r\nand if I do not find my self chargeable with Neglect I am not\r\ngreatly chagrind when things do not go on exactly according to my\r\nmind. Indeed I have the Happiness of believing that what I most\r\nearnestly wish for will in due time be effected. We cannot make\r\nEvents. Our Business is wisely to improve them. There has been\r\nmuch to do to confirm doubting Friends & fortify the Timid. It\r\nrequires time to bring honest Men to think & determine alike even\r\nin important Matters. Mankind are governed more by their feelings\r\nthan by reason. Events which excite those feelings will produce\r\nwonderful Effects. The Boston Port bill suddenly wrought a Union\r\nof the Colonies which could not be brot about by the Industry of\r\nyears in reasoning on the necessity of it for the Common Safety.\r\nSince the memorable 19th of April one Event has brot another on,\r\ntill Boston sees her Deliverance from those more than savage\r\nTroops upon which the execrable Tyrant so much relyed for the\r\nCompletion of his horrid Conspiracys and America has furnishd her\r\nself with more than seventy Battalions for her Defence. The\r\nburning of Norfolk & the Hostilities committed in North Carolina\r\nhave kindled the resentment of our Southern Brethren who once\r\nthought their Eastern Friends hot headed & rash; now indeed the\r\nTone is alterd & it is said that the Coolness & Moderation of the\r\none is necessary to allay the heat of the other. There is a\r\nreason that wd induce one even to wish for the speedy arrival of\r\nthe British Troops that are expected at the Southward. I think\r\nour friends are well prepared for them, & one Battle would do\r\nmore towards a Declaration of Independency than a long chain of\r\nconclusive Arguments in a provincial Convention or the\r\nContinental Congress. I am very affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN SCOLLAY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA April 30 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nWhile I was sitting down to write you a friendly Letter I had the\r\npleasure of receiving your Favor of the 22 Instant by the Post.\r\nMy Intention was to congratulate you and your Brethren the\r\nSelectmen, upon the precipitate Flight of the British Army & its\r\nAdherents from the Town of Boston, and to urge on you the\r\nNecessity of fortifying the Harbour so as that the Enemies Ships\r\nmight never approach it hereafter. Our grateful Acknowledgments\r\nare due to the Supreme Being who has not been regardless of the\r\nmultiplied Oppressions which the Inhabitants of that City have\r\nsufferd under the Hand of an execrable Tyrant. Their Magnanimity\r\n& Perseverance during the severe Conflict has afforded a great\r\nExample to the World, and will be recorded by the impartial\r\nHistorian to their immortal Honor. They are now restored to their\r\nHabitations & Privileges; and as they are purgd of those Wretches\r\na Part of whose Policy has been to corrupt the Morals of the\r\nPeople, I am perswaded they will improve the happy opportunity of\r\nreestablishing ancient Principles and Purity of Manners--I\r\nmention this in the first place because I fully agree in Opinion\r\nwith a very celebrated Author, that, \"Freedom or Slavery will\r\nprevail in a (City or) Country according as the Disposition &\r\nManners of the People render them fit for the one or the other\";\r\nand I have long been convincd that our Enemies have made it an\r\nObject, to eradicate from the Minds of the People in general a\r\nSense of true Religion & Virtue, in hopes thereby the more easily\r\nto carry their Point of enslaving them. Indeed my Friend, this is\r\na Subject so important in my Mind, that I know not how to leave\r\nit. Revelation assures us that \"Righteousness exalteth a Nation\"-\r\n-Communities are dealt with in this World by the wise and just\r\nRuler of the Universe. He rewards or punishes them according to\r\ntheir general Character. The diminution of publick Virtue is\r\nusually attended with that of publick Happiness, and the publick\r\nLiberty will not long survive the total Extinction of Morals.\r\n\"The Roman Empire, says the Historian, MUST have sunk, though the\r\nGoths had not invaded it. Why? Because the Roman Virtue was\r\nsunk.\" Could I be assured that America would remain virtuous, I\r\nwould venture to defy the utmost Efforts of Enemies to subjugate\r\nher. You will allow me to remind you, that the Morals of that\r\nCity which has born so great a Share in the American Contest,\r\ndepend much upon the Vigilance of the respectable Body of\r\nMagistrates of which you are a Member.\r\n\r\nI am greatly concernd at the present defenceless State of Boston,\r\n& indeed of the whole Eastern District which comprehends New\r\nEngland. We have applied for and obtaind a Committee of Congress\r\nto consider the State of that District. In the mean time I hope\r\nthe General Assembly and the Town are exerting themselves for the\r\nSecurity of the Harbour. I could indeed earnestly wish that the\r\nInhabitants of Boston, who have so long born the Heat & Burden of\r\nthe Day might now have some Respite. But this is uncertain. Their\r\ngenerous Exertions in the American Cause, have renderd them\r\nparticularly obnoxious to the Vengeance of the British Tyrant. It\r\nis therefore incumbent on them to be on their Guard, and to use\r\nthe utmost Activity in putting themselves in a Posture of\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\nI trust their Spirits are not depressd by the Injuries they have\r\nsustaind. The large Experience they have had of military Tyranny\r\nshould rather heighten their Ideas of the Blessings of civil\r\nLiberty and a free Government. While THEIR OWN troops are posted\r\namong them for their Protection, they surely will not lose the\r\nFeelings and resign the Honor of Citizens to the military; but\r\nremember always that standing Armies are formidable Bodies in\r\ncivil Society, & the Suffering them to exist at any time is from\r\nNecessity, & ought never to be of Choice.\r\n\r\nIt is with heartfelt Pleasure that I recollect the Meetings I\r\nhave had with my much esteemd Fellow Citizens in Faneuil Hall,\r\nand I am animated with the Prospect of seeing them again in that\r\nPlace which has long been sacred to Freedom. There I have seen\r\nthe Cause of Liberty & of Mankind warmly espousd & ably\r\nvindicated; and that, at Times when to speak with Freedom had\r\nbecome so dangerous, that other Citizens possessd of less Ardour,\r\nwould have thought themselves excusable in not speaking at all.\r\n\r\nBe so kind as to pay my due Respects to my Friends & be assured\r\nthat I am with the most friendly Regards for Mrs Scollay &\r\nFamily,\r\n\r\nVery Affectionately,\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA May 12 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of receiving your very friendly Letter of the\r\n2d Instant by a Mr Parks. I can readily excuse your not writing\r\nto me so often as I could wish to receive your Letters, when I\r\nconsider how much you are engagd in the publick Affairs; and so\r\nyou must be while your Life is spared to your Country. I am\r\nexceedingly concernd to find by your Letter as well as those of\r\nmy other Friends that so little attention has been given to a\r\nMatter of such weighty Importance as the fortifying the Harbour\r\nof Boston. To what can this be attributed? Is it not wise to\r\nprevent the Enemies making Use of every Avenue especially those\r\nwhich lead into the Capital of our Country. I hope no little\r\nparty Animosities even exist much less prevail in our Councils to\r\nobstruct so necessary a Measure. Such Contentions you well\r\nremember that Fiend Hutchinson & his Confederates made it their\r\nconstant Study to stir up between the friends of the Colony in\r\nthe different parts of it, in order to prevent their joynt\r\nexertions for the Common Good. Let us with great Care avoid such\r\nSnares as our Enemies have heretofore laid for our ruin, and\r\nwhich we have found by former Experience have provd too\r\nsuccessfull to their wicked purposes. This will, I think be an\r\nimportant Summer to America; I confide therefore in the Wisdom of\r\nour Colony, and that they will lay aside the Consideration of\r\nsmaller Matters for the present, and bend their whole Attention\r\nto the necessary Means for the common Safety. I hope the late\r\nSituation of Boston is by this time very much alterd for the\r\nbetter; if not, it must needs be a strong Inducement to the Enemy\r\nto reenter it, and whether we ought not by all means in our Power\r\nto prevent it, I will leave to you and others to judge.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Congress resolvd into a Committee of the whole to\r\ntake under Consideration the report of a former Committee\r\nappointed to consider the State of the Eastern District which\r\ncomprehends New Engd. It was then agreed that the Troops in\r\nBoston be augmented [to] Six Thousand. The Question lies before\r\nthe Congress and will be considerd tomorrow. I am inclind to\r\nthink the Vote will obtain. [But] what will avail the ordering\r\nadditional Regiments if Men will not inlist? Do our Countrymen\r\nwant animation at a time when [all] is at Stake! Your Presses\r\nhave been too long silent. What are your Committees of\r\nCorrespondence about? I hear Nothing of circular Letters--of\r\njoynt Committees, &c. Such Methods have in times past raised\r\n[the] Spirits of the people--drawn off their Attention from\r\nPICKING UP PINS, & directed their Views to great objects--But,\r\nnot having had timely Notice of the Return of this Express, I\r\nmust conclude (with my earnest prayers for the recovery of your\r\nHealth,) very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA May 15 1776\r\n\r\nSIR/\r\n\r\nIt was not till the Beginning of this Month that I had the Honor\r\nof receiving your Favor of the 22d of March, respecting a\r\nProposition of Coll Baillie for opening a Road from Connecticutt\r\nRiver to Montreal. The President, soon after, laid before\r\nCongress your Letter of the 5th, a Paragraph of which referrs to\r\nthe same Subject. The Resolution of Congress thereon has, I\r\npresume, before this Time been transmitted to you by him; by\r\nwhich it appears that they have fully concurrd with you in\r\nOpinion of the Utility of the Measure proposd.\r\n\r\nI beg Leave by this Opportunity to acquaint your Excellency, that\r\nthe Letters I have receivd from some Gentlemen of the Colony of\r\nMassachusetts Bay express great Concern at the present\r\ndefenceless state of the Town of Boston, while they are not\r\nwithout Apprehension of another Visit from the Enemy. They\r\nthought themselves extremely happy in your Presense there, and\r\nregretted very much the Necessity of your Departure, to which\r\nNothing reconciles them, but their earnest Desire that the\r\ngeneral Service may be promoted. Congress have resolvd that the\r\nfive Battalions in that Colony be filled up, and new ones raisd\r\nfor the Defence of the Eastern District. As two General Officers\r\nwill be sent thither, it would, I am perswaded, give great\r\nSatisfaction to the People, if General Gates and Mifflin might be\r\nfixed upon. This however, I chearfully submit to your Excellencys\r\nJudgment and Determination; being well assurd, that the Safety of\r\nthat distressd City will have as full a Share of your Attention\r\nas shall be consistent with the good of the whole. I have the\r\nHonor to be with very great Esteem and Affection,\r\n\r\nYour Excellencys most humbe servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORATIO GATES.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE June 10 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour Favor of the 8th Instant was brought to me by Express. I am\r\nexceedingly concernd that a General Officer is not yet fixed upon\r\nto take the Command of the Troops in Boston--ever since the Enemy\r\nabandond that place I have been apprehensive that a renewed\r\nattack would probably be made on some part of Massachusetts Bay.\r\nYour Reasons clearly show that it will be the Interest of the\r\nEnemy to make a grand push there if they are not properly\r\nprovided for a Defence. Congress judgd it necessary that a Major\r\n& Brigr Genl should be sent to Boston or they would not have\r\norderd it three Weeks ago. The Wish of the Colony with regard to\r\nparticular Gentlemen has been repeatedly urgd, and I thought that\r\nan appointment which has been made since you left us would have\r\ngiven a favorable Issue to our request. The Necessity of YOUR\r\ntaking the Command in the Eastern District immediately, has been\r\nin my mind most pressing since I have been informd by your Letter\r\nthat your Intelligence in respect to the Attack on the\r\nMassachusetts is direct & positive.\r\n\r\nIt will be a great Disappointment to me if General Mifflin does\r\nnot go with you to Boston. I believe that to prevent the apparent\r\nnecessity for this, Genl Whitcomb was thrown into View. He is\r\nindeed in many respects a good Man, but to the other I think the\r\npreference must be given.\r\n\r\nThe Hint you gave me when I last saw you respecting the Enemies\r\noffering to treat, I have revolvd in my Mind. It is my opinion\r\nthat no such offers will be made but with a Design to take\r\nAdvantage by the Delay they may occasion. We know how easily our\r\npeople, too many of them, are still amusd with vain hopes of\r\nreconciliation. Such Ideas will, no doubt, be thrown out to them,\r\nto embarrass the Army as others have been; but I conceive that\r\nthe General in whose Wisdom & Valor I confide, will, without\r\nHesitation employ all his Force to annoy & conquer immediately\r\nupon the Enemies Approach. We want our most stable Councellors\r\nhere. To send Gentlemen of INDECISIVE Judgments to assist as\r\nfield Deputies would answer a very ill purpose. The sole Design\r\nof the Enemy is to subjugate America. I have therefore no\r\nConception that any terms can be offerd but such as must be\r\nmanifestly affrontive. should those of a different Complexion be\r\nproposd, under the hand of their Commanding officer, the General\r\nwill have the oppty of giving them in to Congress in the space of\r\na Day. This I imagine he will think prudent to do--at the same\r\ntime, I am very sure, he will give no Advantage to the Enemy, and\r\nthat he will conduct our affairs in so critical a Moment in a\r\nManner worthy of himself.\r\n\r\nI am affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEREZ MOULTON.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA June 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Watertown in August last the General Assembly being\r\nthen sitting, a Crowd of Business prevented our coming to an\r\nAgreement respecting an allowance adequate to your Services in\r\nthe Secretaries Office, or even conversing upon the Subject. I\r\nhave been very easy about it, because I have never had the least\r\nDoubt of your Integrity and Honor. Publick Affairs have demanded\r\nso much of my Attention here that I have scarcely had Time to\r\nspend a thought on my domestick Concerns. But I am apprehensive\r\nthat Mrs A------ will soon be in Want of Money for her Support,\r\nif that is not already her Case. I shall therefore be much obligd\r\nto you if you will let her have such a part of the Fees you may\r\nhave receivd as you can conveniently spare. Her Receipt shall be\r\nacknowledgd by me. And as I foresee that I shall not have the\r\nopportunity of visiting my Friends in New England so soon as I\r\nhave intended, you will further oblige me by sending me an\r\nAccount of the Monies paid into the office together with your own\r\nopinion of what may be a reasonable and generous Allowance for\r\nyour Service.\r\n\r\nI am with great Esteem & Affection,\r\nYour Friend & hbl Servt\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf., page 109.

I dare not at present communicate\r\nto you what I take to have been the real Causes of these\r\nDisasters. Some of them indeed must be obvious to any Man who has\r\nbeen attentive to that Department. Our secret Enemies have found\r\nMeans to sow the Seeds of Discord & Faction there and Heaven has\r\nsufferd the small Pox to prevail among our Troops. It is our Duty\r\nto try all Means to restore our Affairs to a good Footing but I\r\ndespair of that being effected till next Winter. To be acting\r\nmerely on the defensive at the Time when we should have been in\r\nfull possession of that Country is mortifying indeed. The Subject\r\nis disgusting to me. I will dismiss it.\r\n\r\nHow[e] is arrivd, as you have heard, with his Troops at New York.\r\nThe People in this Colony & the Jerseys are in Motion and if the\r\nNew England Militia joyn our Army with their usual Alertness &\r\nSpirit, I have no doubt but the Enemy will meet with a warm\r\nReception. A few days may probably bring on Event which will give\r\na favorable Turn to our Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has at length declared the Colonies free and\r\nindependent States. Upon this I congratulate you for I know your\r\nheart has long been set upon it. Much I am affraid has been lost\r\nby delaying to take this decisive Step. It is my opinion that if\r\nit had been done Nine months ago we might have been justified in\r\nthe Sight of God and Man, three Months ago.1 If we had done it\r\nthen, in my opinion Canada would [by] this time have been one of\r\nthe united Colonies; but \"Much is to be endurd for the hardness\r\nof Mens hearts.\" We shall now see the Way clear to form a\r\nConfederation, contract Alliances & send Embassadors to foreign\r\nPowers & do other Acts becoming the Character we have assumd.\r\nAdieu my Friend. Write to me soon.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1The first thirteen words of this sentence are crossed out in the\r\ndraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., American Philosophical Society; a draft is in the Samuel\r\nAdams Papers, Lenox Library; and a text is in R. H. Lee, Life of\r\nR. H. Lee, vol. i., pp. 182-184.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA July 15 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge that when you left Congress I gave you Reason\r\nto expect a Letter from me before this Time. You will not, I am\r\nvery certain, attribute my omission to the Want of a most cordial\r\nEsteem for you. The Truth is, I hardly knew how to write without\r\nsaying something of our Canadian Affairs; and this is a Subject\r\nso thoroughly mortifying to me, that I could wish totally to\r\nforget all that has past in that Country. Let me however just\r\nmention to you that Schuyler & Gates are to command the Troops to\r\nbe employ'd there; the former, while they are without, and the\r\nlatter, while they are within the Bounds of Canada.--Admitting\r\nboth these Generals to have the military Accomplishments of\r\nMarlborough and Eugene, I cannot conceive that such a Disposition\r\nof them can be attended with any happy Effects, unless Harmony\r\nsubsists between them.--Alass! I fear this is not the Case--\r\nAlready Disputes have arisen, which they have referrd to\r\nCongress! And though they appear to treat each other with a\r\nPoliteness becoming their Rank, in my Mind, Altercations between\r\nCommanders who have Pretensions so nearly equal, I mean in Point\r\nof COMMAND, forebode a Repetition of Misfortunes--I sincerely\r\nwish my Apprehensions may prove to be groundless.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe, as you have heard, is arrivd at New York. He has\r\nbrought with him from 8 to 10,000 troops. Lord Howe arrivd the\r\nlast Week, and the whole Fleet is hourly expected. The Enemy\r\nlanded on Staten Island. Nothing of Importance has been done,\r\nsaving that last Friday at about three in the afternoon a 40 and\r\na 20 Gun Ship with several Tenders, taking the Advantage of a\r\nfair and fresh Gale and flowing Tide, passd by our Forts as far\r\nas the Encampment at Kings bridge. General Mifflin who commands\r\nthere in a Letter of the 5 Instant informd us he had twenty one\r\nCannon planted and hoped in a Week to be formidable.\r\nReinforcements are arrivd from N England, and our Army are in\r\nhigh Spirits. I am exceedingly pleasd with the calm & determind\r\nSpirit, which our Commander in Chiefe has discoverd in all his\r\nLetters to Congress. May Heaven guide and prosper Him! The\r\nMilitia of the Jerseys--Pennsylvania & Maryland are all in\r\nMotion--General Mercer commands the flying Camp in the jerseys.\r\nWe have just now appointed a Committee to bring in a Plan for\r\nReinforcement to compleat the Number of 20,000 Men to be posted\r\nin that Colony.\r\n\r\nOur Declaration of Independency has given Vigor to the Spirits of\r\nthe People. Had this decisive Measure been taken Nine Months ago,\r\nit is my opinion that Canada would at this time have been in our\r\nhands. But what does it avail to find fault with what is past.\r\nLet us do better for the future. We were more fortunate than\r\nexpected in having 12 of the 13 Colonies in favor of the all\r\nimportant Question. The Delegates of N York were not impowered to\r\ngive their Voice on either Side. Their Convention has since\r\nacceeded to the Declaration & publishd it even before they\r\nreceivd it from Congress. So mighty a Change in so short a Time!\r\nN Jersey has finishd their Form of Government, a Copy of which I\r\ninclose. They have sent us five new Delegates, among whom are Dr\r\nWitherspoon & judge Stockden.1 All of them appear to be attachd\r\nto the American Cause. A Convention is now meeting in this City\r\nto form a Constitution for this Colony. They are empowerd by\r\ntheir Constituents to appoint a new Committee of Safety to act\r\nfor the present & to chuse new Delegates for Congress. I am told\r\nthere will be a Change of Men, and if so, I hope for the better.\r\n\r\nA Plan for Confederation has been brot into Congress wch I hope\r\nwill be speedily digested and made ready to be laid before the\r\nseveral States for their approbation. A Committee has now under\r\nConsideration the Business of foreign Alliance.\r\n\r\nIt is high time for us to have Ambassadors in foreign Courts. I\r\nfear we have already sufferd too much by Delay. You know upon\r\nwhom our Thoughts were turnd when you was with us.\r\n\r\nI am greatly obligd to you for favoring me with the Form of\r\nGovernt agreed upon by your Countrymen. I have not yet had time\r\nto peruse it, but dare say it will be a Feast to our little\r\nCircle. The Device on your great Seal pleases me much.\r\n\r\nPray hasten your journey hither. Your Country most pressingly\r\nsollicits, or will you allow me to say, DEMANDS your Assistance\r\nhere. I have written in great haste.

There never was a more pressing Necessity for their\r\nExertions than at present. Our Army in N. Y. consists of not more\r\nthan half the number of those which we have reason to expect will\r\nin a very short Time be ready to attack them--and to this let me\r\nadd that when we consider how many disaffected Men there are in\r\nthat Colony, it is but little better than an Enemies Country. I\r\nam sensible this is a busy Season of the year, but I beg of you\r\nto prevail on the People to lay aside every private Concern and\r\ndevote themselves to the Service of their Country. If we can gain\r\nthe Advantage of the Enemy this Campaign we may promise ourselves\r\nSuccess against every Effort they will be able to make hereafter.\r\nBut I need not multiply words. I am sure YOUR Mind is fully\r\nimpressd with the Importance of this Measure.

It must be\r\nallowd by the impartial World that this Declaration has not been\r\nmade rashly. The inclosd Catalogue of Crimes of the deepest Dye,\r\nwhich have been repeatedly perpetrated by the King will justify\r\nus in the Eyes of honest & good Men. By multiplied Acts of\r\nOppression and Tyranny he has long since forfeited his Right to\r\nGovern. The Patience of the Colonies in enduring the most\r\nprovoking Injuries so often repeated will be Matter of\r\nAstonishmt. Too Much I fear has been lost by Delay, but an\r\naccession of several Colonies has been gaind by it. The Delegates\r\nof every colony were present & concurrd in this important act;\r\nexcept those of N. Y. who were not authorizd to give their Voice\r\non the Question, but they have since publickly said that a new\r\nConvention was soon to meet in that Colony & they had not the\r\nleast Doubt of their acceeding to it. Our Path is now open to\r\nform a plan of Confederation & propose Alliances with foreign\r\nStates. I hope our Affairs will now wear a more agreable Aspect\r\nthan they have of late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA July 20 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI have the Pleasure of informing you, that the Continental Troops\r\nunder the Command of Major Genl Lee, have tryumphd over the\r\nBritish Forces in South Carolina, the particulars of which you\r\nhave in the inclosd Paper. I trust this Blow has given so great a\r\nCheck to the Power of the Enemy as to prevent their doing us any\r\nmaterial Injury in that part of America. We look towards New\r\nYork, and earnestly Pray that God would order a decisive Event in\r\nour Favor there--you must have earlier Intelligence from time to\r\ntime of the Circumstances of our Affairs in that Department than\r\nyou can have from this place. Yesterday Circular Letters with\r\ninclosd Declarations from Lord Howe to the late Governors of New\r\nJersey & the Colonies Southward as far as Georgia, were laid\r\nbefore Congress. As they were orderd to be publishd, I have the\r\nOpportunity of transmitting a printed Copy of them for your\r\nAmusement. There were also Letters from London to private Persons\r\nprobably procured if not dictated by the British Ministry and\r\nwritten with a manifest Intention to form a Party here in favor\r\nof his Lordship, to induce People to believe that he is a cordial\r\nFriend to America, and that he is empowerd to offer Terms of\r\nAccommodation acceptable to the Colonists. But it is now too late\r\nfor that insidious Court to play such Tricks with any reasonable\r\nHopes of Success. The American States have declard themselves no\r\nlonger the Subjects of the British King. But if they had remaind\r\nsuch, the Budget is now opened to the World, and the People see\r\nwith their own Eyes, with how much MAGNANIMITY the Prince offers\r\nthem Pardon on Condition that they will submit to be his abject\r\nSlaves.\r\n\r\nI was informd in a Letter I recd from London last March, that\r\nthis very Nobleman declind to accept the Commission until he\r\nshould be vested with Authority to offer to us honorable Terms--\r\nthat he made a Merit of it. And yet he now comes with Terms\r\ndisgraceful to human Nature. If he is a good kind of Man, as\r\nthese Letters import, I am mistaken if he is not weak & ductile.\r\nHe has always voted, as I am told in favor of the Kings Measures\r\nin Parliament, and at the same time professd himself a Friend to\r\nthe Liberties of America! He seems to me, either never to have\r\nhad any good Principles at all, or not to have had Presence of\r\nMind openly and uniformly to avow them. I have an Anecdote which\r\nI will communicate to you at another Time--at present I have not\r\nLeisure.\r\n\r\nPray let me have a Letter from you soon. You cannot do me a\r\ngreater Act of Kindness or more substantially serve me than by\r\nwriting often.\r\n\r\nI am affectionately,\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\nWill you be kind enough to let my Family know that I am in\r\nhealth. I wish you wd present my respectful Compts to my very\r\nvenerable Friend D C----y.1 I hope the worthy old Gentleman is in\r\nHealth & Spirits.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf., page 155.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN KENT.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD July 27 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI must beg you to impute to the true Reason my not having yet\r\nacknowledgd & answerd your very obliging Letter of the 24 May.\r\nThe WANT OF LEISURE often prevents my indulging the natural\r\nInclination of my Mind to converse with my distant Friends by\r\nfamiliar Epistles; for however unequal I feel my self to the\r\nStation in which our Country has placed me here, I am\r\nindispensibly obligd to attend the Duties of it with Diligence.\r\n\r\nIt has been difficult for a Number of persons sent from all parts\r\nof so extensive a Territory and representing Colonies (or as I\r\nmust now call them STATES) which in many Respects have had\r\ndifferent Interests & Views, to unite in Measures materially to\r\naffect them all. Hence our Determinations have been necessarily\r\nslow. We have however gone on from Step to Step, till at length\r\nwe are arrivd to perfection, as you have heard, in a Declaration\r\nof Independence. Was there ever a Revolution brot about,\r\nespecially so important as this without great internal Tumults &\r\nviolent Convulsions! The Delegates of every Colony in Congress\r\nhave given their\r\n       Voices in favor of the great Question, & the People I am\r\ntold, recognize the Resolution as though it were a Decree\r\npromulgated from Heaven. I have thot that if this decisive\r\nMeasure had been taken six months earlier, it would have given\r\nVigor to our Northern Army & a different Issue to our military\r\nExertions in Canada. But probably I was mistaken. The Colonies\r\nwere not then all ripe for so momentous a Change. It was\r\nnecessary that they shd be united, & it required Time & patience\r\nto remove old prejudices, to instruct the unenlightend, convince\r\nthe doubting and fortify the timid. Perhaps if our Friends had\r\nconsiderd how much was to be previously done they wd not have\r\nbeen, as you tell me some of them were, \"impatient under our\r\nDelay.\"\r\n\r\nNew Govts are now erecting in the several American States under\r\nthe Authority of the people. Monarchy seems to be generally\r\nexploded. And it is not surprising to me, that the Aristocratick\r\nSpirit which appeard to have taken deep Root in some of them, now\r\ngives place to that of Democracy, You justly observe that \"the\r\nSoul or Spirit of Democracy is VIRTUE.\" No State can long\r\npreserve its Liberty \"where Virtue is not supremely honord.\" I\r\nflatter my self you are mistaken in thinking ours is so very\r\ndeficient, and I do assure you, I find reliefe in supposing your\r\nColouring is too high. But if I deceive my self in this most\r\nessential point, I conjure you and every Man of Influence by\r\nExample and by all Means to stem the Torrent of Vice, which, as a\r\ncelebrated Author tells us, \"prevailing would destroy, not only a\r\nKingdom or an Empire, but the whole moral Dominion of the\r\nAlmighty throughout the Infinitude of Space.\" I have Time only to\r\nadd that I am very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH TRUMBULL.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Augt 3 17762\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nOur Friend Coll W brought & deliverd to me your Letter of the---\r\nJuly directed to Mr J. A. and myself. The Inclosures clearly show\r\nthe deplorable State of our Affairs in the Northern Department\r\nand it is easy to see the Source of them. I am fully of opinion\r\nthat ONE MAN must be removd to some other Department, to put an\r\nEnd to our Misfortunes there but this has hitherto been\r\nimpracticable, though it has been attempted and urgd. A little\r\nTime may perhaps unravel Mysteries and convince Gentlemen that\r\nthey have been under certain Prejudices to which the wisest Men\r\nare lyable. It appears to me very extraordinary that Mr L. should\r\ninsist upon acting after being apprizd of the Resolve of\r\nCongress, and it is still more extraordinary that he meets with\r\nthe Support of . . . . in such Conduct. I am very sure that our\r\nAffairs must greatly suffer if he is allowd to persist in so\r\ndoing, and your Reputation as well as the Good of the Service may\r\nbe at Stake. I think it would not be amiss for you to State the\r\nMatter to the General by which means it might be laid before\r\nCongress. You are the best judge of the part proper for you to\r\nact on this occasion in your own Department but I shall certainly\r\ndo all in my Power to have the Evils you mention corrected. I\r\nhave communicated your Letter to several Gentlemen who will joyn\r\nwith me in every practicable Method for this purpose. Congress\r\nhave this day passd several Resolutions which I hope tend to this\r\ngood Effect. Paymasters & Deputy Paymasters are to make weekly\r\nReturns to Congress of the State of the Military Chests under\r\ntheir Direction. Jonn Trumble Esqr Pay Master in the Northern\r\nDepartment is to transmit as soon as possible an Acct of all the\r\nMonies which have passed through his Hands. Commissaries & Depy\r\nComssys Genl in the several Departments are to transmit to\r\nCongress weekly Accots of Monies they receive of Pay Masters or\r\ntheir Deputies--Quarter Masters & Deputy Qr Masters to do the\r\nsame--and the Commanding Officers in Each Departmt are to make\r\nmonthly returns to Congress of the Drafts they make on the\r\nrespective Paymasters. Comry General, Qr Masters Genl & their\r\nDeputies to make monthly Returns at least of Stores in their\r\nPossession & the Distribution of them. These Resolutions perhaps\r\nmay not please EVERY BODY, but if they are duly executed, they\r\nmay detect Mistakes or Frauds if any should happen. As to what\r\nhas happend in Canada & near it, some person is in my opinion\r\nmost egregiously to blame, and, to use a homely Proverb, the\r\nSaddle has been laid, or attempted to be laid on the wrong horse.\r\nI hope that by strict Scrutiny the Causes will be found out and\r\nthe guilty Man made to suffer. My Regards to Genl Mifflin & all\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nI am respectfully,\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nSince writing the foregoing I have turnd to the printed Journals\r\nof Congress and find that on the 17th of July 1775 Walter\r\nLivingston Esq was appointed \"Commissary of Stores & provisions\r\nfor the New York Departmt during the PRESENT Campaign. \"Upon what\r\nGrounds then does he speak of himself as vested by Congress with\r\nfull powers to act TILL REVOK'D? The last Campaign wch limitted\r\nhis power to act, is finishd. Under what pretence can he be\r\nsupported by his Patron, especially since by the Resolution of\r\nCongress of the 8th of July last, you have \"full Power to supply\r\nboth Armies, that upon the Lakes as well as that at N Y, & also\r\nto appoint & employ such persons under you & to remove any Deputy\r\nCommissary as you shall think proper & expedient,\"3 and for this\r\nexpress Reason \"it being absolutely necessary that the Supply of\r\nBOTH Armies shd be under ONE Direction.\" Has not Genl S----- seen\r\nthis Resolution? or if he has seen it, Does he judge that the\r\nSupply of the two Armies shd be under different Directions, &\r\nundertake to order accordingly? If the Persons whom you send to\r\nact under you in the Northern Army are confined & limitted by ANY\r\nother Person after they arrive there, unless by order of\r\nCongress, & without giving you Notice in case such order shd be\r\nmade, we must expect a Repetition of the most mortifying\r\nDisappointments. Upon my Word I think it your Duty to remonstrate\r\nthis, either to the Commander in Chief or to the Congress.

Ferry on Tuesday Six Clock P M & passd over the next\r\nmorning--found the Genl & his family in Health & spirits. Indeed\r\nevery Officer & Soldier appears to be determind. I have not had\r\nOppty to view the Works here, but I am told they are strong &\r\nwill be well defended whenever an Attack is made which is\r\nexpected daily. I see now more than I ever did the Importance of\r\nCongress attending immediately to Inlistments for the next\r\nCampaign. It would be a pity to lose your old Soldiers. I am of\r\nOpinion that a more generous Bounty shd be given, 20 Dollars &\r\n100 Acres of Land for three years at least--but enough of this--\r\n\r\nThe State of our Northern Army mends apace. The Number of\r\ninvalids decreases. Harmony prevails. They carry on all kinds of\r\nBusiness within themselves. Smiths Armourers Carpenters Turners\r\nCarriage Makers Rope Makers &c &c they are well provided with.\r\nThere were at Tyconderoga Augt 12 2,668 Rank & file fit for Duty\r\nat Crown Point & Skeensborough 750, in Hospital 1,110-Lt\r\nWhittemore returnd from his Discoveries--he left St Johns July 30\r\nsaw 2000 or 2500 at that place & Chamblee. Stores coming on from\r\nMontreal--counted 30 Batteaus. No Vessell built or building. This\r\nAccot may I think be depended upon. In my opinion we are happy to\r\nhave G Gates there. The Man who has the Superintendency of Indian\r\nAffairs--the nominal Command of the Army--is the REAL Contractor\r\n& Quarter Master Genl &c &c has too many Employmtts to attend to\r\nthe reform of such an Army--besides the Army can confide in the\r\nVALOR & MILITARY Skill & Accomplishments of GATES--SAT VERBUM\r\nSAPIENTI; pray write me & let me know the Confed. &c goes on.\r\nMajor Meigs a brave officer & a Prisoner taken at Quebeck is at\r\nthis time, as I suppose, at Philadelphia--he wishes to be\r\nexchanged--such an Officer would be very usefull here. I wish you\r\nwd give him your Assistance. I propose to sett off tomorrow for\r\nthe Eastward.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\nCap Palmer is in this City waiting for inlisting orders. I wish\r\nthe Rank of the Navy officers was settled & the Commissions made\r\nout. Capt Dearborne of N Hampshire is in the same Predicament\r\nwith Major Meigs.

I should have written to you from this place\r\nbefore, but I have not had Leisure. My Time is divided between\r\nBoston & Watertown, and though we are not engagd in Matters of\r\nsuch Magnitude as now employ your Mind, there are a thousand\r\nthings which call the Attention of every Man who is concernd for\r\nhis Country. Our Assembly have appointed a Committee to prepare a\r\nForm of Government--they have not yet reported. I believe they\r\nwill agree in two legislative Branches --their great Difficulty\r\nseems to be to determine upon a free and adequate Representative,\r\n--they are at present an unwieldy Body. I will inform you more of\r\nthis when I shall have the Materials. The Defence of this Town\r\nyou know has lain much upon our Minds. Fortifications are erected\r\nupon several of the Islands, which I am told require at least\r\n8000 Men. You shall have a particular Account when I am at\r\nLeisure,--by my Manner of writing you may conclude that I am now\r\nin haste. I have receivd no Letter from Philade or New York since\r\nI was favord with yours, nor can I find that any other person\r\nhas. It might be of Advantage to the common Cause for us to know\r\nwhat is doing at both those important places. We have a Report\r\nthat a Committee is appointed (as the expression is) \"to meet the\r\nHowes,\" and that you are one. This, without Flattery gave me\r\npleasure. I am indeed at a Loss to conclude how such a Movement\r\ncould be made consistent with the Honor of the Congress, but I\r\nhave such an Opinion of the Wisdom of that Body, that I must not\r\ndoubt of the Rectitude of the Measure. I hope they will be\r\nvigilant and firm, for I am told that Lord Howe is, though not a\r\ngreat man, an artful Courtier. May God give us Wisdom Fortitude\r\nPerseverance and every other virtue necessary for us to maintain\r\nthat Independence which we have asserted. It would be ridiculous\r\nindeed if we were to return to a State of Slavery in a few Weeks\r\nafter we had thrown off the Yoke and asserted our Independence.\r\nThe Body of the people of America, I am perswaded, would resent\r\nit--but why do I write in this Stile--I rely upon the Congress &\r\nthe committee. I wish however to know a little about this Matter,\r\nfor I confess I cannot account for it to my own Mind. I will\r\nwrite to you soon-in the mean time,\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\nWhat has been the Issue of the Debates upon a weighty Subject\r\nwhen I left you, and another Matter (you know what I mean) of\r\ngreat Importance? Is it not high time they were finishd?\r\n\r\nPay my due Regards to the President Mess Paine1 & Gerry2 Coll\r\nLees and other Friends.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\n1Robert Treat Paine.\r\n2A portion of a letter by Samuel Adams to Gerry, dated September\r\n23, 1776, is printed in W.

The\r\nCaution given in the first of these Letters was well designd; and\r\nhad it come to me as early as you had Reason to expect it would,\r\nI should have been relievd of a full fortnights Anxiety of Mind.\r\nI was indeed greatly \"concernd\" for the Event of the proposd\r\nConference with Lord Howe. It is no Compliment when I tell you,\r\nthat I fully confided in the Understanding and Integrity of the\r\nGentlemen appointed by Congress; but being totally ignorant of\r\nthe Motives which inducd such a Measure, I was fearful lest we\r\nmight be bro't into a Situation of great Delicacy and\r\nEmbarrassment. I perceive that his Lordship would not converse\r\nwith you as Members of Congress or a Committee of that Body; from\r\nwhence I concluded that the Conference did not take its Rise on\r\nhis part. As I am unacquainted with its Origination and the\r\nPowers of the Committee, I must contemplate the whole Affair as a\r\nRefinement in Policy beyond my Reach, and content myself with\r\nremaining in the Dark, till I have the Pleasure of seeing you,\r\nwhen, I trust, the Mystery will be fully explaind to me. Indeed I\r\nam not so sollicitous to know the Motives from whence this\r\nConference sprang, or the Manner in which it was brought up, as I\r\nam pleasd with its Conclusion. The Sentiments and Language of the\r\nCommittee, as they are related to me, were becoming the Character\r\nthey bore. They mannagd with great Dexterity. They maintaind the\r\nDignity of Congress, and in my Opinion, the Independence of\r\nAmerica stands now on a better footing than it did before. It\r\naffords me abundant Satisfaction, that the Minister of the\r\nBritish King, commissiond to require and fondly nourishing the\r\nHopes of receiving the Submission of America, was explicitly and\r\nauthoritatively assured, that neither the Committee nor that\r\nCongress which sent them had Authority to treat in any other\r\nCapacity than as INDEPENDENT STATES. His Lordship, it seems, \"has\r\nno Instruction on that Subject.\" We must therefore fight it out,\r\nand trust in God for Success. I dare assure my self, that the\r\nmost effectual Care has before this time been taken, for the\r\nContinuance and Support of our Armies, not only for the Remainder\r\nof the present, but for a future year. The People will cheerfully\r\nsupport their Independence to the utmost. Their Spirits will rise\r\nupon their knowing the Result of the late Conference. It has, you\r\nmay depend upon it, been a Matter of great Expectation. Would it\r\nnot be attended with a good Effect, if an Account of it was\r\npublishd by Authority of Congress? It would, I should think, at\r\nleast put it out of the Power of disaffected Men (and there are\r\nsome of this Character even here) to amuse their honest Neighbors\r\nwith vain hopes of Reconciliation.\r\n\r\nI wish that Congress would give the earliest Notice to this\r\nState, of what may be further expected to be done here for the\r\nSupport of the Army. The Season is advancing or rather passing\r\nfast. I intended when I sat down to have written you a long\r\nEpistle, but I am interrupted. I have a thousand Avocations which\r\nrequire my Attention. Many of them are too trifling to merit your\r\nNotice. Adieu, my Friend. I hope to see you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL MATHER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Dreer Collection, Historical Society of Pennsylvania; a\r\ntext is in the Emmet Collection, Lenox Library; and a draft is in\r\nthe Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Octob 26 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nOn the Evening of the 24th Instant I arrivd in good health in\r\nthis City--I give you this Information in Compliance with my\r\nWord, and flattering my self that I shall very soon be favord\r\nwith a Letter from you--I will promise to give you hereafter as\r\nmuch Intelligence as the Secrecy to which I am in honour bound\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\nI met with Nothing disagreable in my journey, saving my being\r\nprevented from passing through the direct Road in East Chester,\r\nthe Enemy having taken Possession of the Ground there--Our Army\r\nis extended in several Encampments from Kings Bridge to White\r\nPlains which is 12 or 15 Miles Northward, commanded by the\r\nGenerals Lord Sterling, Bell (of Maryland) Lincoln, McDougal,\r\nLee, Heath & Putnam--I mention them, I think, in the order as\r\nthey are posted from the Plains to the Bridge--The Generals Head\r\nQuarters are now at Valentine Hill about the Center of the\r\nEncampments. The Army is in high Spirits and wish for Action.\r\nThere have been several Skirmishes; one on Fryday the 18th in\r\nwhich the Massachusetts Regiment commanded by Coll Glover\r\ndistinguishd their Bravery and they have receivd the Thanks of\r\nthe General. In this Rencounter the Enemy sustaind a considerable\r\nLoss, it is said not less than 700 Men--Another on the Night of\r\nthe 21st. The infamous Major Rogers with about 400 Tories of Long\r\nIsland, having advancd towards Mareneck1 on the Main, was\r\ndefeated by a Party of ours with the Loss of 36 Prisoners besides\r\nkilled & wounded. This valiant Hero was the first off the Field--\r\nSuch Skirmishes, if successful on our Part, will give Spirit to\r\nour Soldiers and fit them for more important and decisive Action,\r\nwhich I confess I impatiently wish for.--I have said that our\r\nSoldiers are in high Spirits; I add, that so far as I can learn\r\nthe Character of the General officers of the Enemys Army, we at\r\nleast equal them in this Instance, we have an excellent\r\nCommissary & Quarter Master General, officers of great Importance\r\n--Mifflin, who servd so much to our Advantage in the latter of\r\nthese Employments, has condescended to take it again though he\r\nhad been promoted to the Rank & Pay of a Brigadier General--The\r\nEnemy is posted in a rough hilly Country, the Advantages of which\r\nAmericans have convincd them they know how to improve--Under all\r\nthese Circumstances I should think that the sooner a General\r\nBattle was brot on, the better; but I am no Judge in military\r\nMatters.\r\n\r\nAn interresting Affair, about which a Circle of Friends whom I\r\nhad the Pleasure of meeting at Dr Chauncys, is finishd, I think,\r\nagreably to their Wishes--I can only add at present that I am\r\nwith the most cordial Esteem,\r\n\r\nSir your assured Friend\r\n& very humble Servant\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Mamaroneck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA, Novr 14th 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI wrote to you within a Day or two after my Arrival here by an\r\nExpress. I cannot say that I was not disappointed in not\r\nreceiving a Line from you by the last Post, as I thought I had\r\nReason to expect. While I am absent from you I am continually\r\nanxious to know the State of your Health. I must therefore beg\r\nyou to write to me often. I have not for many years enjoyd a\r\ngreater Share of that invalueable Blessing than I have since I\r\nleft Boston. I believe the journey on Horseback has been greatly\r\nbeneficial to me.\r\n\r\nWe have lately receivd Intelligence from the Northern Army of\r\ncertain Movements of the Enemy in that Quarter, of which you will\r\nsee an Account in the inclosd News Paper. This day we have\r\nfurther Intelligence that they have totally abandond Crown Point\r\n& retreated into Canada. We have also just receivd a Letter from\r\na Gentleman living on the Sea Coasts of New Jersey informing us\r\nthat near 100 Sail of the Enemies Ships with two Frigates & a\r\nfifty Gun Ship were seen steering to the Eastward. It is supposd\r\nthey are bound to England. We had before heard that the whole\r\nForce of the Enemy had marchd unexpectedly & precipitately into\r\nthe City of New York. This evening an Express is come in from\r\nGeneral Greene who commands on this Side the North River in the\r\nJersys with Advice that ten thousand of the Enemies Troops were\r\nembarkd, and that it was given out that they were destind to\r\nSouth Carolina. This may be a Feint. Possibly they may be coming\r\nto this City, which in my Opinion is rather to be desired,\r\nbecause the People of this State are more numerous than that of\r\nSouth Carolina. In either Case however I dare say that a good\r\nAccount will be given of them. It is said that Lord Dunmore is to\r\ntake the Command. If this be true, it looks as if they were going\r\nto Virginia. Be it as it may, the withdrawing so great a Part of\r\ntheir Troops from New York, it is hoped, will make it an easy\r\nmatter for our Army to conquer the Remainder.\r\n\r\nIt has not been usual for me to write to you of War or\r\nPoliticks,--but I know how deeply you have always interrested\r\nyourself in the Welfare of our Country and I am disposd to\r\ngratify your Curiosity. Besides you will hope that from these\r\nMovements of our Enemies a Communication between Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia will be more safe and we may the more frequently\r\nhear from each other.\r\n\r\nNovr 17th I wish you would acquaint your Brother Sammy that\r\nGeneral Mifflin is now Quartermaster General in Room of Coll\r\nMoylan--that when I was at Head Quarters I mentiond to the\r\nGeneral the treatment your Brother had met with. He told me that\r\nhe would have him state the Matter to him in Writing and that he\r\nwould endeavor to have justice done to him. The Letter your\r\nBrother formerly wrote to me I left at Boston. If he will give me\r\na full Account of the Matter in another Letter, I will state it\r\nto General Mifflin, but the Circumstances of things are such at\r\npresent that I would not have him depend on its being immediately\r\nattended to. I will however do all in my power to serve him.\r\n\r\nOur Friend Mr Lovell1 is at last exchangd. We receivd a Letter\r\nfrom him two or three days ago. Probably before this reaches you\r\nhe will have arrivd at Boston. Pray remember me to my Daughter,\r\nSister Polly with the rest of my Family & Friends, and be assured\r\nthat I am most sincerely & affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf. page 248.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS.

This Intelligence, I flatter myself,\r\nwill not be disagreable to you. I have not receivd a Line from\r\nyou since I left Boston which gives me Reason to suspect that\r\nyour Letters may have fallen into wrong hands.\r\n\r\nTraveling, it seems, is of late become somewhat dangerous; should\r\nthis be intercepted and be seen by the two Brothers,1 they will\r\nhave an opportunity of knowing that I am still most firmly\r\nattachd to the best Cause that virtuous Men contend for, and that\r\nI am animated with the full Perswasion that righteous Heaven will\r\nsupport the Americans if they persevere in their manly Struggles\r\nfor their Liberty. I have no Reason to suspect the Virtue of the\r\nGenerality of my Countrymen. There are indeed Poltrons & Trayters\r\neverywhere. I do not therefore think it strange that some such\r\nCharacters are to be found in this City, but the indignation of\r\nthe People kindles at the expected approach of the Enemies Army,\r\nand every proper measure is taking to meet them on the Road and\r\nstop their wild Career.--I am told that Lord Howe has lately\r\nissued a Proclamation offering a general Pardon with the\r\nException of only four Persons viz Dr Franklin Coll Richard Henry\r\nLee Mr John Adams & myself. I am not certain of the Truth of this\r\nReport. If it be a Fact I am greatly obligd to his Lordship for\r\nthe flattering opinion he has given me of my self as being a\r\nPerson obnoxious to those who are desolating a once happy Country\r\nfor the sake of extinguishing the remaining Lamp of Liberty, and\r\nfor the singular Honor he does me in ranking me with Men so\r\neminently patriotick.\r\n\r\nI hope you will write to me by every opportunity.

Indeed I am in hopes your Committee for\r\nproviding Cloathing &c for the Army have already in a great\r\nMeasure answerd the Request. You will have heard of the\r\nScituation of the Armies before this will reach you. A Part of\r\nthe Enemy have got on this Side of Hudsons River, but I dare say\r\nyou will have a good Account of them. I am more chagrind at the\r\nDisgrace than the Loss we have met with by the Surrender of Forts\r\nWashington & Lee. They should not have cost the Enemy less than\r\nthousands of their Troops. After all, what have the mighty\r\nVictors gaind? a few Miles of Ground at the Expence of many\r\nMillions of their Treasure & the Effusion of much of their Blood.\r\nBut we must stop their Career. This I am satisfied can & will be\r\ndone. Mr Gerry writes to you by this opportunity--therefore I\r\nneed not add more than that I am very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1A marginal postscript, in the autograph of Adams, reads: \"Pray\r\ndeliver the inclosd, if your Leisure will admit with\r\nyour own hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. ii., pp. 452-454; an\r\nincomplete text.]\r\n\r\n[PHILADELPHIA, December 4, 1776.]\r\n\r\nIt affords me singular pleasure to be informed that our General\r\nAssembly is now sitting in Boston. I have been of opinion that\r\nthe public business could be done with more despatch there than\r\nelsewhere. \"You have appointed a committee of war,\" with very\r\nextensive powers, \"and appropriated to their disposition two\r\nhundred thousand pounds to purchase everything necessary to carry\r\non the war with vigor next year.\" I heartily rejoice to hear\r\nthis. I hope the committee are men of business, and will make a\r\ngood use of the powers and moneys they are intrusted with. Let me\r\ntell you, that every nerve must be strained to resist the British\r\ntyrant, who, in despair of availing himself of his own troops\r\nwhich lately he so much prided himself in, is now summoning the\r\npowers of earth and hell to subjugate America. The lamp of\r\nliberty burns there and there only. He sees it, and is impatient\r\neven to madness to extinguish it. It is our duty, at all hazards,\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\nBut I am sensible I need not write you in this style. You and the\r\nrest of my countrymen have done, and I have no doubt will\r\ncontinue to do, your duty in defence of a cause so interesting to\r\nmankind. It is with inexpressible pleasure that I reflect that\r\nthe mercenary forces of the tyrant have for two years in vain\r\nattempted to penetrate the Eastern Colonies; there our enemies\r\nthemselves, and those who hate us, acknowledge that the rights of\r\nman have been defended with bravery. And did not South Carolina\r\nnobly withstand the efforts of tyranny? She did. Virginia too,\r\nand North Carolina, have in their turn acted with a spirit\r\nbecoming the character of Americans But what will be said of\r\nPennsylvania and the Jerseys? Have they not disgraced themselves\r\nby standing idle spectators while the enemy overran a great part\r\nof their country? They have seen our army unfortunately separated\r\nby the river, retreating to Newark, to Elizabethtown, Woodbridge,\r\nBrunswick, and Princeton. The enemy's army were, by the last\r\naccount, within sixty miles of this city. If they were as near\r\nBoston, would not our countrymen cut them all to pieces or take\r\nthem prisoners? But by the unaccountable stupor which seems to\r\nhave pervaded these States, the enemy have gained a triumph which\r\nthey did not themselves expect. A triumph, indeed! Without a\r\nvictory! Without one laurel to boast of! For Bunker's Hill they\r\nfought and bled. They sacrificed their bravest officers, and we\r\nwished them twenty such victories. But the people of the Jerseys\r\nhave suffered them to run through their country without the risk\r\nof even a private soldier! They expended their ammunition at\r\ntrees and bushes as they marched! But I hear the sound of the\r\ndrum. The people of Pennsylvania say of themselves, that they are\r\nslow in determining, but vigorous in executing. I hope that we\r\nshall find both parts of this prediction to be just. They say, We\r\nare now determined, and promise to bring General Howe to a hearty\r\nrepentance for venturing so near them. I have the pleasure to\r\ntell you that, within a few days past, they have made a spirited\r\nappearance. In spite of Quakers, Proprietarians, timid Whigs,\r\nTories, petit-maitres, and trimmers, there is a sufficient number\r\nof them in arms resolved to defend their country. Many of them\r\nare now on the march. Heaven grant they may be honorable\r\ninstruments to retrieve the reputation of their countrymen and\r\nreduce Britain to a contemptible figure at the end of this\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear our harbor looks so brilliant. I HOPE IT IS\r\nFORTIFIED AGAINST EVERY ATTEMPT OF THE ENEMY NEXT SPRING.\r\n\r\nIn your letters, you ask me two important questions. I dare not\r\nrepeat them. With regard to the last you will understand me when\r\nI tell you, let not your mind be troubled about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS.

I am still in good Health and Spirits, although the\r\nEnemy is within Forty Miles of this City. I do not regret the\r\nPart I have taken in a cause so just and interresting to Mankind.\r\nI must confess it chagrins me greatly to find it so illy\r\nsupported by the People of Pennsylvania and the Jerseys. They\r\nseem to me to be determind to give it up--but I trust that my\r\ndear New England will maintain it at the Expence of every thing\r\ndear to them in this Life---they know how to prize their\r\nLiberties.

Mr\r\nBrown who carries this Letter will give you a particular Account\r\nof the Circumstances of things here--to him I refer you. Pray\r\nremember me to my Daughter, Sister Polly, the rest of my Family &\r\nFriends. I hope the Life of our valueable Friend Mrs March will\r\nyet be spared. She is indeed a good Woman. Tell my worthy\r\nNeighbor Mr Preston, that I rejoyce to hear of his honorable\r\nAppointment. I hope & believe he will use his office well. I wish\r\nto have a Letter from you. You cannot imagine how highly I prize\r\nsuch a Favor. My daily Prayer is for your Safety, & Happiness in\r\nthis Life & a better. Adieu, my dear. You cannot doubt the\r\nsincere & most cordial Affection of,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\nDecr 11\r\n\r\nSince writing the above I have receivd your Letter of the 9th of\r\nNovr, for which I am much obligd to you. If this City should be\r\nSURRENDERD, I should by no means despair of our Cause. It is a\r\nrighteous Cause and I am fully perswaded righteous Heaven will\r\nsucceed it. Congress will adjourn to Baltimore in Maryland, about\r\n120 Miles from this place, when Necessity requires it and not\r\nbefore. It is agreed to appoint a Day of Prayer, & a Come will\r\nbring in a Resolution for that purpose this day. I wish we were\r\na more religious People. That Heaven may bless you here &\r\nhereafter is the most ardent Prayer of, my dear, most cordially,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Decr 12 1776\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nWe are this moment informd by a Gentleman who is Brother of Coll\r\nGriffin, and has lately been at New York, that a Body of ten\r\nthousand of the Enemies Troops had actually arrivd at Rhode\r\nIsland. As Congress is now adjournd to Baltimore in Maryland, and\r\nthe President and the Board of War are not in Town, we think it\r\nour Duty to send you this Intelligence; and as there is no\r\nGeneral Officer in that Department, we refer it to your\r\nConsideration whether the Service does not absolutely require\r\nthat one be immediately sent to take the Command of Troops that\r\nmay be raisd there to repel the Progress of the Enemy.\r\n\r\nIf Major General Gates or Green,1 who are greatly belovd in that\r\nPart of America with a suitable Number of Brigadiers could be\r\nspared for this Service, it would be attended with another\r\nAdvantage, that of facilitating the new Inlistments.\r\n\r\nWe intreat your Attention to this important Matter, and are with\r\ngreat Respect,\r\n\r\nSir your very humble Servants,2\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1The words \"or Green\" and \"with a suitable number of Brigadiers,\"\r\nwere added by interlineations in the first draft.\r\n2Signed by Adams, Elbridge Gerry, William Ellery, and William\r\nWhipple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE IN MARYLAND\r\n\r\nDecr 19th 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nThe Day before yesterday I arrivd in this Place which is One\r\nhundred Miles from Philadelphia. The Congress had resolvd to\r\nadjourn here when it should become absolutely necessary and not\r\nbefore. This sudden Removal may perhaps be wonderd at by some of\r\nmy Friends, but was not without the advice of Generals Putnam &\r\nMifflin, who were at Philadelphia to take Measures for its\r\nPreservation from the Enemy. For my own part, I had been used to\r\nAlarms in my own Country, and did not see the Necessity of\r\nremoving so soon, but I suppose I misjudgd because it was\r\notherwise ruled. It must be confessd that deliberative Bodies\r\nshould not sit in Places of Confusion. This was heightned by an\r\nunaccountable Backwardness in the People of the jerseys &\r\nPennsylvania to defend their Country and crush their Enemies when\r\nI am satisfied it was in their Power to do it. The British as\r\nwell as Hessian officers have severely chastisd them for their\r\nFolly. We are told that such savage Tragedies have been acted by\r\nthem without Respect to Age or Sex as have equaled the most\r\nbarbarous Ages & Nations of the World. Sorry I am that the People\r\nso long refusd to harken to the repeated Calls of their Country.\r\nThey have already deeply staind the Honor of America, and they\r\nmust surely be as unfeeling as Rocks if they do not rise with\r\nIndignation and revenge the shocking Injuries done to their Wives\r\nand Daughters. Great Britain has taught us what to expect from\r\nSubmission to its Power. No People ever more tamely surrenderd\r\nthan of that Part of the Jerseys through which the Enemy marchd.\r\nNo opposition was made. And yet the grossest Insults have been\r\nofferd to them, and the rude Soldiery have been sufferd to\r\nperpetrate Deeds more horrid than Murder. If Heaven punishes\r\nCommunities for their Vices, how sore must be the Punishment of\r\nthat Community who think the Rights of human Nature not worth\r\nstruggling for and patiently submit to Tyranny. I will rely upon\r\nit that New England will never incur the Curse of Heaven for\r\nneglecting to defend her Liberties. I pray God to increase their\r\nVirtue and make them happy in the full and quiet Possession of\r\nthose Liberties they have ever so highly prizd. YOUR Wellfare, my\r\ndear, is ever near my heart. Remember me to my Daughter Sister\r\nPolly & the rest of my Family and Friends. I am in high Health &\r\nSpirits. Let me hear from you often.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\nMr. Hancock is just now arrivd with his Family--all in good\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE IN MARYLAND Decr 25 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been continually writing to you, I have had the\r\nPleasure of receiving only one Letter from you since I left New\r\nEngland. The Congress is here, scituated conveniently enough and\r\ndoing Business. You will ask me perhaps, How we came here. I\r\nconfess I did not see the Necessity of removing so soon; but I\r\nmust think I misjudgd because it was ruled otherwise, not indeed\r\nuntil the Opinions of Putnam & Mifflin then in Philadelphia, had\r\nbeen taken. The Truth is, the Enemy were within seventeen Miles\r\nof us, and it was apprehended by some that the People of\r\nPennsylvania, influenced by Fear Folly or Treachery, would have\r\ngiven up their Capital to appease the Anger of the two Brothers &\r\natone for their Crime in suffering it to remain so long the Seat\r\nof Rebellion. We are now informd that they have at length\r\nbestirrd themselves and that hundreds are daily flocking to Genl\r\nWashingtons Camp, so that it is hoped if our Army pursues as\r\nexpeditiously as they have retreated, they will take them all\r\nPrisoners before they can reach the Borders of Hudsons River.\r\n\r\nWe have this day receivd a Letter from General Schuyler, which\r\nhas occasiond the passing a Resolution, forwarded to you, I\r\nsuppose by this opportunity. The General says he is informd that\r\nthe Levies are making very tardily. I hope he has been\r\nmisinformd. It is certainly of the greatest Importance that New\r\nEngland in a particular Manner should be very active in\r\nPreparation to meet the Enemy early in the Spring. The British\r\nTyrant will not quit his darling Plan of subduing that Country.\r\nThe Intent of the Enemy seems to me to be to attack it on all\r\nSides. Howes Troops have penetrated this way far beyond his\r\nExpectations; I flatter myself they will be driven back to New\r\nYork & winter there. Carleton will, unless prevented by an\r\nimmediate Exertion of New England, most certainly possess himself\r\nof Tyconderoga as soon as Lake Champlain shall be frozen hard\r\nenough to transport his Army. Clinton it is said is gone to Rhode\r\nIsland with 8 or 10 thousand to make Winter Quarters there. The\r\ninfamous Behavior of the People of Jersey & Pennsylvania will\r\ngive fresh Spirits to the British Court and afford them a further\r\nPretence to apply to every Court in Europe where they can have\r\nany Prospect of Success. Russia has already been applied to.\r\nTheir whole Force will be poured into N England for they take it\r\nfor granted that having once subdued those stubborn States, the\r\nrest will give up without a Struggle. They will take Occasion\r\nfrom what has happend in Jersey to inculcate this Opinion. How\r\nnecessary is it then for our Countrymen to strain every Nerve to\r\ndefeat their Design. The Time is short. Let this be the only\r\nSubject of our Thoughts and Consultation. Our Affairs in France\r\nwear a promising Aspect. Let us do our Duty and defend the fair\r\nInheritance which our Fathers have left us--our pious Forefathers\r\nwho regarded Posterity & fought and bled that they might transmit\r\nto us the Blessing of Liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen we first heard at Philadelphia of Clintons having saild to\r\nRhode Island, Mr Gerry and myself joynd with Coll Whipple of New\r\nHampshire & Mr Ellery of Rhode Island in a Letter to Genl\r\nWashington and proposed to him the sending Gen Gates or Greene\r\nwith a suitable number of Brigadiers to take the Command in the\r\nEastern Departmt. [In] his answer which we receivd in this place\r\nhe tells us he has orderd M Genl Spencer & B Genl Arnold to\r\nrepair thither who he hopes may be sufficient to head the\r\nyeomanry of that Country & repel the Enemy in their attempts to\r\ngain possession of that part of the Continent. He [adds] that he\r\nwill if possible, send some other Brigadiers, and says Gen\r\nWooster is also at hand.\r\n\r\nI wrote to you after my Arrival at Philade & inclosd a Resolution\r\nof Congress relative to the procuring of cloathing in N E for the\r\nArmy. In another Letter I gave you a hint which I think of great\r\nImportance if the Measure proposd [be] practicable. I hope both\r\nthese Letters were duly receivd by you. You cannot, my dear Sir,\r\ndo me a greater Kindness than by writing to me. I suffer much\r\nthro want of Intelligence from N E; I pray you therefore let your\r\nLetters to me be very frequent.\r\n\r\nI am very cordially your friend,\r\n\r\nBy a late Letter from London written by a Gentn upon whose\r\nIntelligence I greatly rely a Treaty is on foot with Russia to\r\nfurnish Britain with 20 or 30,000 troops. Levies are making with\r\nall possible Industry in Germany & in Britain & Ireland from\r\nwhere it is expected that 20,000 will be raisd. It [is] indeed to\r\nbe supposd that, as usual, a greater Appearance will be made on\r\npaper than they will realize. But let us consider that they\r\nrealizd in America the last year 35,000 and do without doubt . .\r\n. . . . . they lose because they are able to do it, we may then\r\nset down their actual force in America by May or June next at\r\nleast 55 and probably 60,000.\r\n\r\nWe have the pleasure of hearing that a valueable Prize is arrivd\r\nat [Boston]--among the rest of her Cargo 10,000 Suits of Cloaths!\r\nA most fortunate Prize for us, especially as she is said to be\r\nthe last of 8 Vessels taken bound to Quebec. However while we are\r\npleasing ourselves with the Acquisition we should remember that\r\nthe Want of those supplys will be a strong Stimulus to Carleton\r\nto make an early & bold push over the Champlain in hopes of\r\nfurnishing himself at Albany; & increases the Necessity of the\r\nEastern States sending their Troops to Tyconderoga immediately to\r\nsupply the places of those who will return home, when the time of\r\ntheir Inlistments shall expire. I have good Information from\r\nEngland that a certain Captn Furze who [was] in Boston the last\r\nyear & gaind the Confidence & recd the Civilities of the People;\r\nwhen he returnd gloried in the Deception & carried Intelligence\r\nto the British Ministry, particularly of the Fortifications in &\r\nabout Boston. Some of the People may remember him. How careful\r\nought we to be lest while we mean only innocent Civility, we\r\nexpose our Councils & Operations to Spies.\r\n\r\nI remain very cordially your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE IN MARYLAND 26 Decr 1776\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI have written to you once since I arrivd here, and am determind\r\nto omit no opportunity, because I flatter myself you will at all\r\ntimes be gratified in hearing from me. I am at present in good\r\nhealth and am exceedingly happy in an Acquaintance with Mr Samuel\r\nPurviance a Merchant of this Place, with whom I have indeed\r\nbefore corresponded, but I never saw him till I came here. He is\r\na sensible, honest and friendly Man, warmly attachd to the\r\nAmerican Cause, and has particularly endeard himself to me by his\r\ngreat Assiduity in procuring Reliefe in this part of the\r\nContinent for the Town of Boston at a Time when her Enemies would\r\nhave starvd her by an oppressive Port bill.\r\n\r\nJust now I receivd a Letter from my Son dated the 7th Instant; he\r\ntells me he had very lately heard from his Sister and that she\r\nand the rest of my Family were well. I pray God to continue your\r\nHealth and protect you in these perilous times from every kind of\r\nEvil. The Name of the Lord, says the Scripture, is a strong\r\nTower, thither the Righteous flee and are Safe. Let us secure his\r\nFavor, and he will lead us through the journey of this Life and\r\nat length receive us to a better.\r\n\r\nWe are now informd that the People of Jersey & Pennsylvania are\r\nin Possession of their Understanding and that they are turning\r\nout in great Numbers to the Assistance of General Washington. Had\r\nthey done this early they would not have so deeply staind the\r\nReputation of America. However I shall hardly think they will do\r\ntheir Duty at last if they suffer the Enemy to return without\r\npaying dearly for the barbarous Outrages they have committed in\r\nthe Country, without Regard to Age or Sex.\r\n\r\nOur Affairs in France & Spain wear a pleasing Aspect, but human\r\nAffairs are ever uncertain. I have strongly recommended to my\r\nFriends in New England to spare no Pains or Cost in preparing to\r\nmeet the Enemy early in the Spring. We have a righteous Cause,\r\nand if we defend it as becomes us, we may expect the Blessing of\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nRemember me to my Daughter, Sister Polly & the rest of my Family\r\n& Friends. Adieu, my dear,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Decr 30 1776\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nBeing a Committee of Congress we are directed to employ some\r\nsuitable Person to make Application to your Honorable Board for\r\ncertain Ordnance and other Stores, which have been represented by\r\nGeneral Schuyler as immediately necessary for the Use of the\r\nNorthern Army. We accordingly send forward Collo Stewart, who\r\nwill lay before the Board such Stores as are wanted; which we\r\nhope may be procurd on just and equitable Terms, and transported\r\nwith all possible Dispatch to General Schuyler, whose Receipt\r\nwill be duly acknowledgd by Congress.\r\n\r\nWe need not urge the great Importance of having our Army in that\r\nQuarter well furnishd with every necessary Article, there being\r\nnot the least Reason to doubt of General Carletons Intentions as\r\nearly as possible to push his Forces into the Eastern States, or\r\nof his Success in such an Attempt unless seasonably prevented.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore our earnest Request that you would afford Coll\r\nStuart every possible advice & assistance in the Prosecution of\r\nthis Business, and furnish him with such Money as he may have\r\nneed of for the purpose in which Case your Draft on the President\r\nof the Congress will be duly honord.\r\n\r\nWe are with the most cordial Esteem\r\nSir\r\nyour most obedient\r\n& very humble Servants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WALTER STEWART.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a portion is printed in\r\nW.

You will then apply to Governor Trumbull, to be furnishd\r\nby him with the Remainder, to be sent to General Schuyler as\r\nearly as possible this Winter.\r\n\r\nFor the Ordnance Stores we depend chiefly upon the Massachusetts\r\nBay; and desire you to make Application to the Council of that\r\nState; although we would by no means restrain you in Endeavors to\r\nprocure them in New York Connecticutt or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe doubt not but you will provide these Necessaries with all\r\npossible Dispatch, and at reasonable Rates; and we desire you to\r\ngive Notice to General Schuyler and to us of the Success you may\r\nmeet with in your several Applications.\r\n\r\nWe would inform you that Congress has contracted for Cannon to be\r\ncast in this State at the Rate of Thirty Six pounds ten shillings\r\np Ton. And the highest price that has been given in Pennsylvania\r\nis Forty Pounds. We desire and expect you will purchase them at\r\nthe lowest Rate you can.

Your second\r\nLetter I receivd a few days ago inclosing Copies of Papers from\r\nSpain. I am much obligd to you for them. Our Affairs in Europe\r\nlook well, and additional Measures are taking here to establish\r\nthem in that Part of the World on a solid Foundation. I assure\r\nyou Business has been done since we came to this Place more to my\r\nSafisfaction than any or every thing done before, excepting the\r\nDeclaration of Independence which should have been made\r\nimmediately after the 19th of April 75. OUR MINISTERS ABROAD are\r\ndirected to assure FOREIGN COURTS that notwithstanding the artful\r\n& insidious Representations of the Emissaries of the British\r\nCourt to the Contrary, the Congress and People of America are\r\ndetermind to maintain their Independence at all Events. This was\r\ndone before the late Success in the Jerseys, of which you will\r\nhave doubtless had Intelligence before this Letter reaches you. I\r\nnow think that Britain will soon make a most contemptible Figure\r\nin America & Europe--but we must still make our utmost Exertions.\r\nPray let the Levies required of our State be raisd with all\r\npossible Expedition. By this Conveyance you will have a\r\nResolution giving large Powers to General Washington for a\r\nlimited Season. It became in my opinion necessary. The Hint I\r\ngave you some time ago, I still think very important. General\r\nGates arrivd here yesterday. I have conversd with him upon it. He\r\ntold me he had conceivd the Idea before and wishes the Measure\r\nmay [be] tryed. It requires Secrecy and Dispatch. Lt Coll Steward\r\nwill set off tomorrow with Directions to proceed as far as Boston\r\nto purchase Ordnance & other Stores if they cannot be procurd\r\nelsewhere. He is General Gates Aid de Camp & is very clev[er.] I\r\nwish you would take Notice of him.\r\n\r\nBut I am now called off. Adieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nRegina Azucena\r\nrazucena@gis.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 225, 226; a draft\r\nis in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE IN MARYLAND, Jan., 2d, 1777.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--It has been altogether from a regard to your safety\r\nthat I have restrained myself from continuing on my part that\r\ncorrespondence which you was obliging enough to indulge for\r\nseveral years. I know very well that your avowal of and warm\r\nattachment to the cause of justice and truth, have rendered you\r\nexceedingly obnoxious to the malice of the British king and his\r\nministers; and that a letter written by a zealous asserter of\r\nthat cause addressed to you while you was in their power, would\r\nhave brought upon you the resentment of that most cruel and\r\nvindictive court. But I cannot omit this opportunity of writing\r\nto you after so long a silence, to assure you that I am most\r\nheartily engaged according to my small ability, in supporting the\r\nrights of America and of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn my last letter to you near two years ago, I ventured to give\r\nyou my opinion that if the British troops then in Boston, should\r\nattempt to march out in an hostile manner, it would most surely\r\neffect a total and perpetual separation of the two countries.\r\nThis they did in a very short time; and the great event has since\r\ntaken place, sooner indeed than I expected it would, though not\r\nso soon, in my opinion, as in justice it might, and in sound\r\npolicy, it ought. But there is a timidity in our nature which\r\nprevents our taking a decisive part in the critical time, and\r\nvery few have fortitude enough to tell a tyrant they are\r\ndetermined to be free. Our delay has been dangerous to us, yet it\r\nhas been attended with great advantage. It has afforded to the\r\nworld a proof, that oppressed and insulted as we were, we are\r\nvery willing to give Britain an opportunity of seeing herself,\r\nand of correcting her own errors. We are now struggling in the\r\nsharp conflict; confiding that righteous heaven will not look\r\nwith an indifferent eye upon a cause so manifestly just, and so\r\ninteresting to mankind.\r\n\r\nYou are now called to act in a still more enlarged sphere. Go on,\r\nmy friend, to exert yourself in the cause of liberty and virtue.\r\nYou have already the applause of virtuous men, and may be assured\r\nof the smiles of heaven.\r\n\r\nYour brother, Mr. R. H. Lee, will give you a particular account\r\nof our affairs in America; nothing therefore remains for me to\r\nadd, but that I am your very affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Jany 8th 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have several times referrd you to a Hint which I gave you not\r\nlong ago, and which I have not thought prudent to repeat lest by\r\nan Accident my Letters should be intercepted. I have still the\r\nsame opinion of the Importance of the Affair, but having spent\r\nthis Evening with General Gates and conversd with him upon that\r\nand other Matters, we have concluded upon a more sure Way of\r\neffecting it than the Way I proposd to you. I wish therefore if\r\nyou have already communicated it to any one of our Friends, that\r\nyou would injoyn them to close Secrecy, and that it may be even\r\nforgot till the Event of it shall be known to the World.\r\n\r\nI am much pleasd to find that the New England Troops have so\r\ngreat a Share in the Honor of the late Action in the Jerseys.\r\nGeneral Gates speaks very highly of the Militia you sent him last\r\nFall. He applauds greatly their Zeal for the Cause and\r\nparticularly their Readiness to tarry in the Service after the\r\nExpiration of the Term of their Inlistments in November, and\r\ntells me he gave them an honorable Discharge. I have not the\r\nPleasure of knowing General Bricket but he mentions him to me as\r\na worthy & good officer.\r\n\r\nWe have further good Accounts from our Army which are credited\r\nalthough they are not yet authenticated. I verily believe that\r\nthe Incursions of the Enemy into the Jerseys will be in the Event\r\nmuch to our Advantage, and that this Campaign will end gloriously\r\non our side; I never will be sanguine in my Expectation for I\r\nknow the Events of War are uncertain, but there seems to be an\r\nenterprizing Spirit in our Army which I have long wishd to see\r\nand without which we may not expect to do great Things. The same\r\nenterprizing Spirit also takes place here. We have done things\r\nwhich I would not have flatterd my self with the least hope of\r\ndoing a Month ago. This Express will carry to the Council a\r\nResolution which I presume will of course be communicated to you.\r\nIn my next I will give you a very particular & good reason\r\nwhy it is not communicated TO YOU in this Letter. We understand\r\nthat by the Enemies Treatment of General Lee there appears to be\r\na Design to consider him as a deserter & take away his Life.\r\nCongress have directed General Washington to acquaint Howe that\r\nif this is his Intention five of the Hessian field officers now\r\nin our hands together with Lt Coll Campbell shall be detained &\r\nsacrificd as an Atonement for his Blood should the Matter be\r\ncarried to that Extremity; and this Resolution will most\r\nundoubtedly in my opinion be executed in full tale.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[John Adams, Works, vol. ix., pp. 448-450.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE, 9 January, 1777.\r\n\r\nI have every day for a month past been anxiously expecting the\r\npleasure of seeing you here, but now begin to suspect you do not\r\nintend to give us your assistance in person. I shall therefore do\r\nall that lies in my power to engage your epistolary aid. You will\r\nby every opportunity receive my letters, and, I dare say, you\r\nwill be so civil as to answer at least some of them.\r\n\r\nI have given our friend Warren, in one of my letters to him, the\r\nbest reason I could for the sudden removal of Congress to this\r\nplace. Possibly he may have communicated it to you. I confess it\r\nwas not agreeable to my mind; but I have since altered my\r\nopinion, because we have done more important business in three\r\nweeks than we had done, and I believe should have done, at\r\nPhiladelphia, in six months. As you are a member of Congress, you\r\nhave a right to know all that has been done; but I dare not\r\ncommit it to paper at a time when the safe carriage of letters is\r\nbecome so precarious. One thing I am very solicitous to inform\r\nyou, because I know it will give you great satisfaction. If you\r\nrecollect our conversation at New Haven, I fancy you will\r\nunderstand me when I tell you, that to ONE PLACE we have added\r\nfour, and increased the number of persons from THREE to six. I\r\nhate this dark, mysterious manner of writing, but necessity\r\nrequires it.\r\n\r\nYou have heard of the captivity of General Lee. Congress have\r\ndirected General Washington to offer six Hessian field-officers\r\nin exchange for him. It is suspected that the enemy choose to\r\nconsider him as a deserter, bring him to trial in a court-\r\nmartial, and take his life. Assurances are ordered to be given to\r\nGeneral Howe, that five of those officers, together with\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Campbell, will be detained, and all of them\r\nreceive the same measure that shall be meted to him. This\r\nresolution will most certainly be executed.\r\n\r\nWe have this day passed a recommendation to the Council of\r\nMassachusetts Bay of a very important nature. It will be sent by\r\nthis express to the Council, to whom I refer you for a perusal of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOur affairs in France and Spain wear a promising aspect, and we\r\nhave taken measures to put them on a respectable footing in other\r\nparts of Europe; and I flatter myself too much if we do not\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the enemy through the Jerseys has chagrined me\r\nbeyond measure; but I think we shall reap the advantage in the\r\nend. We have already beat a part of their army at Trenton, and\r\nthe inclosed paper will give you a farther account which we\r\ncredit, though not yet authenticated. The late behavior of the\r\npeople of Jersey was owing to some of their leading men, who,\r\ninstead of directing and animating, most shamefully deserted\r\nthem. When they found a leader in the brave Colonel Ford, they\r\nfollowed him with alacrity. They have been treated with savage\r\nbarbarity by the Hessians, but I believe more so by Britons.\r\nAfter they have been most inhumanly used in their persons,\r\nwithout regard to sex or age, and plundered of all they had,\r\nwithout the least compensation, Lord Howe and his brother (now\r\nSir William, knight of the Bath) have condescended to offer them\r\nprotections for the free enjoyment of their effects.\r\n\r\nYou have seen the power with which General Washington is vested\r\nfor a limited time. Congress is very attentive to the northern\r\narmy, and care is taken effectually to supply it with every thing\r\nnecessary this winter for the next campaign. General Gates is\r\nhere. How shall we make him the head of that army?\r\n\r\nWe are about establishing boards of war, ordnance, navy, and\r\ntreasury, with a chamber of commerce, each of them to consist of\r\ngentlemen who are not members of Congress. By these means, I\r\nhope, our business will be done more systematically, speedily,\r\nand effectually.\r\n\r\nGreat and heavy complaints have been made of abuse in the\r\nDirector-General's department in both our armies; some, I\r\nsuppose, without grounds, others with too much reason. I have no\r\ndoubt but as soon as a committee reports, which is expected this\r\nday, both Morgan and Stringer will be removed, as I think they\r\nought.1\r\n\r\nTo the eighty-eight battalions ordered to be raised, sixteen are\r\nto be added, which, with six to be raised out of the continent at\r\nlarge, will make one hundred and ten, besides three thousand\r\nhorse, three regiments of artillery, and a company of engineers.\r\nWe may expect fifty or sixty thousand of the enemy in June next.\r\nTheir design will still be to subdue the obstinate States of New\r\nEngland. It was the intention that Carleton should winter in\r\nAlbany, Howe in New York, and Clinton at Rhode Island, that, with\r\nre-enforcements in the spring, they might be ready to attack New\r\nEngland on all sides. I hope every possible method will be used\r\nto quicken the new levies, and that the fortifications in the\r\nharbor of Boston will be in complete readiness. Much will depend\r\nupon our diligence this winter.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is also turned to the southward. Forts\r\nPitt and Randolph are to be garrisoned, and provisions laid up\r\nfor two thousand men, six months. By the last accounts from South\r\nCarolina, we are informed that late arrivals have supplied them\r\nwith every thing necessary for their defence.\r\n\r\nI have written in great haste, and have time only to add, that I\r\nam, with sincere regards to your lady and family, very cordially\r\nyour friend,\r\n\r\nP. S. Dr. Morgan and Dr. Stringer are dismissed without any\r\nreason assigned, which Congress could of right do, as they held\r\ntheir places during pleasure. The true reason, as I take it, was\r\nthe general disgust, and the danger of the loss of an army\r\narising therefrom.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Dr. John Morgan, director general, and Dr. Samuel Stringer,\r\ndirector of hospitals in the northern department, were\r\nremoved from office January 9 by the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Jany 16 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nWe receivd by Mr Williams a Letter from the Council of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, requesting a Sum of Money for Payment of\r\nBounties to the Troops to be raisd in that State. Accordingly\r\nthree hundred thousand Dollars are orderd for that Purpose, which\r\nwill be forwarded to the Paymaster as soon as it can conveniently\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nI observe that our Assembly have made it necessary, that three of\r\ntheir Delegates should be present and concurring in Sentiment\r\nbefore the Voice of our State can be taken on any Question in\r\nCongress. I I could have wishd it had been otherwise. Only three\r\nof your Delegates are now present. So it may happen at other\r\ntimes. One of them may be sick; he may be on a Committee, or\r\nnecessarily absent on publick Business; in which Case our State\r\nwill not be effectually represented. While I am writing at the\r\nTable, Mr Gerry is necessarily employd on the Business of the\r\nPublick at home, and the two present cannot give the Sense of the\r\nState upon a Matter now before Congress. Were all the three\r\npresent, one Dissentient might controul the other two so far as\r\nto oblige them to be silent when the Question is called for.\r\nIndeed the Assembly have increasd the Number of Delegates to\r\nSeven. But I submit the Matter, as it becomes me, to my\r\nSuperiors.\r\n\r\nMajor Hawley and my other patriotick Fellow Laborers, Are they\r\nalive and in Health? I have not receivd a Line from any of them\r\nexcepting my worthy Friend Mr Nathl Appleton, whose Letter I will\r\nacknowledge to him by the first opportunity. My Friends surely\r\ncannot think I can go through the arduous Business assignd to me\r\nhere without their Advice and Assistance. I do not know whether\r\nyou ever intend to write to me again. Assure the Major from me,\r\nthat a few more of his \"BROKEN HINTS\" will be of eminent Service\r\nto me.1\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine how much I am pleasd with the Spirit our\r\nAssembly have discoverd. They seem to have put every Country into\r\nMotion. This forebodes in my Mind that something great will be\r\ndone. I have not, since this Contest began, had so happy Feelings\r\nas I now have. I begin to anticipate the Establishment of Peace\r\non such Terms as independent States ought to demand; and I am\r\neven now contemplating by what Means the Virtue of my Countrymen\r\nmay be secured for Ages yet to come. Virtue, which is the Soul of\r\na republican Government. But future Events, I have learnd by\r\nExperience, are uncertain; and some unlucky Circumstance may\r\nbefore long take Place, which may prove sadly mortifying to me.\r\nBut no such Circumstance can deprive me of the Pleasure I enjoy,\r\nin seeing at a Distance, the rising Glories of this new World.\r\nAdieu my Friend. Believe me to be unfeignedly yours,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Cf., page 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Jan 29th 1777.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYesterday I had the Pleasure of receiving two Letters from you by\r\nthe same hand, dated the 9th and 22d of December. And just now a\r\nLetter is deliverd to me from my Friend Mr Bradford, dated the\r\n13th of this Month, wherein I am informd that you was then in\r\ngood Health and Spirits. If you had not told me that you had\r\nwritten to me Six Letters since I left Boston, I should have\r\nsuspected that you did not keep a good Look out for Expresses\r\nwhich come this Way. I have now receivd only four of them. The\r\nothers may possibly have fallen into the Hands of the Lords\r\nPROTECTORS of America. There is one Way in which you may probably\r\nmake up the Loss to me, and that is by writing oftener. I assure\r\nyou, it would not be troublesome to me to receive half a Dozen\r\nLetters from you at one Time.\r\n\r\nYou tell me you was greatly alarmd to hear that General Howe's\r\nArmy was on the March to Philadelphia. I have long known you to\r\nbe possessd of much Fortitude of Mind. But you are a Woman, and\r\none must expect you will now and then discover Timidity so\r\nnatural to your Sex. I thank you, my Dear, most cordially for the\r\nWarmth of Affection which you express on this Occasion, for your\r\nAnxiety for my Safety and your Prayers to God for my Protection.\r\nThe Man who is conscientiously doing his Duty will ever be\r\nprotected by that Righteous and all powerful Being, and when he\r\nhas finishd his Work he will receive an ample Reward. I am not\r\nmore convincd of any thing than that it is my Duty, to oppose to\r\nthe utmost of my Ability the Designs of those who would enslave\r\nmy Country; and with Gods Assistance I am resolvd to oppose them\r\ntill their Designs are defeated or I am called to quit the Stage\r\nof Life.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that the Winter has been in a remarkable Degree\r\nso favorable in New England, because it must have lessend the . .\r\n. . been increasd . . . . the Poor, is in Holy Writ coupled with\r\nhim who OPPRESSES them. Be you warm and be you cloathd, without\r\nadministering the necessary Means, is but cold Consolation to the\r\nmiserable. I am glad you have given Shelter to Mrs A. who had not\r\nwhere to lay her Head. She deservd your Notice, and she has more\r\nthan rewarded you for it in being, as you say she is, GRATEFUL.\r\nWhenever you see a poor Person grateful, you may depend upon it,\r\nif he were rich he would be charitable. We are not however, to\r\nseek Rewards in this Life, for Deeds of Charity, but rather\r\nimitate the all merciful Being, of whom, if I mistake not, it is\r\nsaid in Scripture, that he doth Good to the Evil and UNTHANKFUL.\r\nThere is indeed no such Thing as disinterrested Benevolence among\r\nMen. Self Love and social, as Pope tells us, is the same. The\r\ntruly charitable Man partakes of the Feelings of the wretched\r\nwherever he sees the Object, and he relieves himself from Misery\r\nby relieving others.\r\n\r\nI am greatly grievd for the Loss we have met with in the Death of\r\nMr Checkley. From the Account you give me of the Nature & Extent\r\nof his Disorder, I conclude he must have died before this Time.\r\nHe was indeed a valueable Relation and Friend. Have you lately\r\nheard from your Brother at St Eustatia?\r\n\r\nWe have no News here. The Events which take place in the Jerseys\r\nmust be known in Boston before you can be informd of them from\r\nthis Place. There is a Report that a Party of the Jersey Militia\r\nfell in with a larger Party of the Enemy, killed about twenty and\r\ntook a greater Number Prisoners besides fifty three Waggons and\r\nProvisions. This is believd. It is also said that General Heath\r\nhas taken Fort Washington. If it be so, we shall soon have the\r\nNews confirmd . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Feb. 1, 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nThe Proceedings of the Committees of the four New England States\r\nhave been read in Congress and are now under the Consideration of\r\na Committee of the whole. They are much applauded as being\r\nsalutary and wise. I had heard that one of your Delegates at that\r\nConvention had written a long Letter to his Friend and Confident\r\nhere, and hearing it whisperd that the Massachusetts State\r\ndisapprovd of the Proceedings, I was led to ask the Gentleman who\r\nhad receivd the Letter concerning it. He confirmd it and said\r\nthat not only the Trade but the landed Gentlemen in the House of\r\nRepresentatives were sanguine against it. I beg'd him to let me\r\nsee his Letter but he refusd in a kind of Pet, telling me it was\r\na private Letter, & leaving me to conjecture whether I had really\r\nbeen impertinent in asking a Sight of his Letter or whether the\r\nContents of it were such as it was not proper for me to see. You\r\nwill easily conceive what a Scituation a Man must be in here, who\r\nhaving receivd no Intelligence of the Sentiments of his\r\nConstituents himself is obligd in vain to ask of another upon\r\nwhat Principles they have disapprovd of a Measure if in truth\r\nthey did disapprove of it, of which he is called to give his own\r\nopinion. You may see, my Friend, from this Instance, the\r\nNecessity of your writing to me oftener. When I was told upon the\r\nforementiond occasion, that I should be intitled to see the\r\nLetters of another whenever I should be disposd to show those\r\nwhich I receive myself, I could have truly said that I had\r\nscarcely receivd any. Two only FROM YOU in the Space of near four\r\nMonths. But I have no Claim to your Favors, however much I value\r\nthem, unless perhaps upon the Score of my having neglected not a\r\nsingle Opportunity of writing to you. Your omitting even to\r\nacknowledge the Receipt of my Letters, I might indeed construe as\r\na silent Hint that they were displeasing to you, but I will not\r\nbelieve this till I have it under your own hand. While I am\r\nwriting your very agreable Letter is brought to me by Mr Lovell.\r\nYou therein speak, as you ever have done, the Language of my\r\nSoul. Mr Adams tells me you are President of the Board of War; I\r\nam therefore inducd to recall what I have just now said which you\r\nmay construe as an implied Censure for your not having written to\r\nme oftener. I am sure you must have a great Deal of Business in\r\nyour hands. I am not however sorry to hear it, provided your\r\nHealth is not injurd by it. I pray God to preserve the Health of\r\nyour Body and the Vigor of your Mind. We must cheerfully deny our\r\nselves domestick Happiness and the sweet Tranquility of private\r\nLife when our Country demands our Services. Give me Leave to hint\r\nto you my Opinion that it would be a Saving to our State in the\r\nWay of Supply if the Board of War would consign the Cargos wch\r\nthey order here to a Merchant of good Character rather than to\r\nthe Master of the Vessell--possibly there may be Exceptions, But\r\nI have Reason to think a Cargo which arrivd about a fortnight ago\r\nconsisting chiefly as I am told of Rum & Sugars was sold at least\r\n30 p Ct under what it wd have fetched if it had been under the\r\nDirection of a Person acquainted in the place, and Flour is\r\npurchasing by the Person who bought the Cargo at an unlimitted\r\nPrice. I am perswaded that if you had by a Previous Letter\r\ndirected a Cargo to be procured here you might have had it 20 p\r\nCent cheaper. If the Board should be of my Mind, I know of no\r\nGentlemen whom I would recommend more chearfully than Mess Samuel\r\n& Robert Purvyance--they are Merchants of good Character, honest\r\n& discrete Men, and warmly attachd to our all important Cause.\r\nBut I get out of my Line when I touch upon Commerce, it is a\r\nSubject I never understood. Adieu my dear Friend. Believe me to\r\nbe yours,\r\n\r\nP. S. I forgot to tell you that, a fair occasion offering, I\r\nmoved in Congress that the eldest Son of our deceasd friend Genl\r\nWarren mt be adopted by the Continent & educated at the publick\r\nExpence. The Motion was pleasing to all and a Come is appointed\r\nto prepare a Resolve. Monuments are also proposd in Memory of him\r\n& Genl Mercer whose youngest Son is also to be adopted &\r\neducated. But these things I would not have yet made publick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Feb 4th 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI send you the inclosd Speech for your Amusement. One or two\r\nRemarks you will observe are made upon it. There is Room for many\r\nmore. I wish some ingenious Pen might be employd. The Contest\r\nwith America, it seems, is now confessd by the British Monarch to\r\nbe \"arduous.\" I think he greatly deceives himself, if he does not\r\nexpect it will be more so. Indeed he sees it; for we must, says\r\nhe, \"AT ALL EVENTS prepare for another Campaign.\" \"If their\r\nTreason is sufferd to take Root, much Mischief will grow out of\r\nit--to the present System of ALL Europe.\" Here we have the\r\nAuthority of a King's (not a very wise one I confess) to affirm,\r\nthat the War between Britain and the united States of America\r\nwill affect the Ballance of Power in Europe. Will not the\r\ndifferent Powers take different Sides to adjust the Ballance to\r\ntheir different Interests? \"I am using my UTMOST Endeavors to\r\nconciliate the unhappy Differences between two Neighboring\r\nPowers.\" If he is still USING his Endeavors, it seems, the\r\nDifferences are not yet made up.--\"I continue to receive\r\nASSURANCES of Amity from the several Courts in Europe\"--But he\r\nadds \"It is expedient we should be in a respectable State of\r\nDEFENCE at home.\" If he has such Assurances of the Continuance of\r\nAmity in Europe, why is it so expedient at this time to be in a\r\nrespectable State of Defence at home? Surely he cannot think the\r\nAMERICAN Navy yet so formidable, as to demand this Caution. Or is\r\nhe at length become wise enough to attend to a good old Maxim, IN\r\nPEACE PREPARE FOR WAR.--By his prefixing a \"NOTWITHSTANDING\" to\r\nhis \"fair Prospect,\" and his being manifestly hard pressd with\r\n\"the present Scituation of Affairs\" in America, I am led to\r\nconclude, that he looks upon his \"Assurances of AMITY\" as the\r\nmere Compliments of a Court; and that he strongly apprehends, the\r\nQuarrel he has plungd himself into with America hath excited a\r\nCuriosity and a Watchfulness in some of the Powers of Europe,\r\nwhich will produce a contrary Effect. I am with very great\r\nEsteem,\r\n\r\nYour assured Friend\r\nand humble Servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Feb 10, 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI beg Leave to inclose my Account of Expences from the 26th of\r\nApril 1775 to the 27 of Augt 1776 amounting to . . . .\r\n\r\nI intended to have laid it before the House of Representatives\r\nwhen I was last in New England, but the sudden Adjournment of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in September last, and my Hurry in preparing for\r\nmy Journey hither after its sitting again in October prevented my\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\nWhen I sat off from Lexington after the memorable Battle there, I\r\nhad with me only the Cloaths on my back, which were very much\r\nworn, those which I had provided for my self being then in\r\nBoston, and it was out of my Power at that time to recover them.\r\nI was therefore under a Necessity, of being at an extraordinary\r\nExpense, to appear with any kind of Decency for Cloathing &\r\nLinnen after my Arrival in this City, which I think makes a\r\nreasonable Charge of Barrils Leonards and Stilles Bills in my\r\nAccot.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be necessary to say something of the Charge of\r\nHorse hire in the last Article. When I left Watertown in\r\nSeptember '75, two Horses were deliverd to me out of the publick\r\nStable for my self & my Servant, by Order of Honbl Council. They\r\nwere very poor when I took them and both tired on the Road as you\r\nwill see in my Account. One of them afterwards died in\r\nPhiladelphia, which obligd me to purchase another in that place,\r\nand with this Horse I returnd to Boston last Fall. His being my\r\nown Property, having purchasd him without Charge to my\r\nConstituents, I think gives me a just Right to make a Charge of\r\nHorse Hire, which is left to be carried out in a reasonable Sum.\r\nMr A says he is obligd to allow seven pounds 10 s for the Hire of\r\neach of his Horses to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI shall take it as a favor if you will present the Account to the\r\nHonbl House, and acquaint the Committee to whom it may be\r\nreferrd, with the Reasons of the Charges above mentiond, and make\r\nany other Explanations which you may judge necessary. Mrs A has\r\nthe Vouchers, to whom I beg you would apply for them in Person\r\nbefore you present the Account. I wish it may be settled as soon\r\nas the House can conveniently attend to it. If an Allowance for\r\nmy Services is considerd at the same time, you will please to be\r\ninformd that I sat off from Lexington or Worcester on the 26th of\r\nApril '75 and returnd on the 14 of August following. And again I\r\nsat off from Watertown on the 1st of Sept '75 and returnd to\r\nBoston on the 27th of August '76.\r\n\r\nI have troubled you with this Epistle of Horse hire and Shop\r\nGoods at a Time when, no Doubt, your Attention is called to\r\nAffairs of the greatest Concern to our Country. Excuse me, my\r\ndear Friend for once, and be assured that I am your affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WALTER STEWART.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Feb 12 1777\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI receivd by Mr Babcock, your Letter dated Lebanon Jany 23,\r\ncommunicated the same to the Committee and afterward laid it\r\nbefore Congress. The Price of the Cannon at Salisbury1 so much\r\nexceeds that at which it is set in a Contract enterd into by\r\nCongress with the Owners of a Foundery in this State, that\r\nCongress have thought proper not to allow it, but have directed\r\nthe Committee to request Governor Trumbull to lend them, to be\r\nreturnd or others in Lieu of them as soon as possible. The Come\r\nhave written accordingly; and I think it necessary to give you\r\nNotice of the Sense of Congress relating to the Price of Cannon\r\nas early as possible, that you may govern yourself thereby in\r\nyour further Execution of your Commission.

It will be an Example for all others to demand the like\r\nPrices; and moreover it may afford a Pretext for those who wish\r\nfor Occasions to spread Jealousy and Discord among the united\r\nStates, to say, that the State of Connecticutt have in this\r\nInstance taken Advantage of the Necessity of the Continent. As\r\nthere is no Reason to entertain so unworthy a Sentiment of that\r\nState we earnestly hope that no Circumstance may take place which\r\nmight gratify the Inclinations of our insidious Enemies to do an\r\nInjury to our common Cause.

I am much concernd to hear that the Tories in\r\nBoston & Massachusetts Bay have lately grown insolent & that no\r\nMeasures are taken to suppress their Insolence. They are the most\r\nvirulent, & I am of Opinion, the most dangerous Enemies of\r\nAmerica. They do not indeed openly appear in Arms, but they do\r\nmore Mischief secretly. I am very apprehensive that they greatly\r\noperate to the preventing Inlistments and doing other essential\r\nInjury to our Cause. If they are not properly dealt with, I am\r\nperswaded, the Publick will much regret the Omission very soon. I\r\ndo not wish for needless Severities; but effectual Measures, and\r\nsevere ones if others are insufficient, to prevent their\r\npernicious Councils & Machinations, I think ought to be taken,\r\nand that without any Delay. It will be Humanity shown to\r\nMillions, who are in more Danger of being reducd to thraldom &\r\nMisery by those Wretches than by British & Hessian Barbarians. I\r\ncannot conceive why a law is not made declaratory of Treason &\r\nother Crimes & properly to punish those who are guilty of them.\r\nIf to conspire the Death of a King is Treason and worthy of\r\nDeath, surely a Conspiracy to ruin a State deserves no less a\r\nPunishment. I have Reason to think you have a Number of such\r\nConspirators among you; and believe me, you will soon repent of\r\nit, if you do not speedily take Notice of them. But let me ask\r\nyou my Friend, Whether some of the late Addressers, Protesters\r\nand Associators, are not seen in the Circles, in the Houses and\r\nat the Tables of Whigs? Is there not Reason to expect that those\r\nwho exiled themselves thro Fear of the just Vengeance of their\r\nCountrymen will be invited by the kind Treatment of those who\r\nhave equal Reason to dread that Vengeance, to return into the\r\nBosom of their much injurd Country. But I need add no more.\r\nBelieve me to be cordially,\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE Feb 16 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nA few days ago a small Expedition was made under the Authority of\r\nthis State, aided by a Detachment of Continental Regulars to\r\nSuppress the Tories in the Counties of Somerset & Worcester on\r\nthe Eastern Shore of Chessapeak, where they are numerous & have\r\narisen to a great Pitch of Insolence. We this day heard rumors\r\nthat one of their Principals, a Doctor Cheyney, is taken & we\r\nhope to hear of the Business being effectually done very soon. In\r\nmy opinion, much more is to be apprehended from the secret\r\nMachination of these rascally People, than from the open Violence\r\nof British & Hessian Soldiers, whose Success has been in a great\r\nMeasure owing to the Aid they have receivd from them. You know\r\nthat the Tories in America have always acted upon System. Their\r\nHead Quarters used to be in Boston--more lately in Philadelphia.\r\nThey have continually embarrassd the publick Councils there, and\r\nafforded Intelligence Advice & Assistance to General Howe. Their\r\nInfluence is extended thro-out the united States. Boston has its\r\nfull share of them and yet I do not hear that Measures have been\r\ntaken to suppress them. On the Contrary I am informd that the\r\nCitizens are grown so polite as to treat them with Tokens of\r\nCivility and respect. Can a Man take fire into his Bosom and not\r\nbe burnd? Your Massachusetts Tories communicate with the Enemy in\r\nBritain as well as New York. They give and receive Intelligences\r\nfrom whence they early form a Judgment of their Measures. I am\r\ntold they discoverd an Air of insolent Tryumph in their\r\nCountenances, and saucily enjoyd the Success of Howes Forces in\r\nJersey before it happend. Indeed, my Friend, if Measures are not\r\nsoon taken, and the most vigorous ones, to root out these\r\npernicious Weeds, it will be in vain for America to persevere in\r\nthis glorious Struggle for the publick Liberty.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe has declared his Intentions that General Lee shall\r\nbe tried by the Laws of HIS Country. So he is considerd as a\r\nDeserter from the British Army. You know the Resolution of\r\nCongress concerning this Matter. It is my Opinion that Lt Colo\r\nCampbell ought immediately to be secured. He is to be detaind as\r\none upon whom Retalliation is to be made. Would you believe it,\r\nthat after the shocking Inhumanity shown to our Countrymen in the\r\nJerseys, plundering Houses, cruelly beating old Men, ravishing\r\nMaids, murdering Captives in cold Blood & sistematically starving\r\nMultitudes of Prisoners under his own Eyes in New York this\r\nhumane General totally disavows even his winking at the Tragedy\r\nand allows that a few Instances may have happend which are rather\r\nto be lamented.\r\n\r\nCongress is now busy in considering the report of the joynt\r\nComtee of the Eastern States. A curious Debate arose on this\r\nSubject, which I have not time now to mention. I will explain it\r\nto you in my next.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE March 19 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI wrote to you by the last Post, and am resolvd to write by every\r\nPost as well as other opportunities. If I have Nothing more to\r\nsay to you, I flatter my self you will be pleasd when I have it\r\nin my Power to tell you, as I now do, that I am in good Health\r\nand Spirits. I must remind you that the last Letter I receivd\r\nfrom you is dated the 26th of January. I am in daily Expectation\r\nof receiving another. You do not conceive with how much\r\nSatisfaction I read your Letters. I wish therefore that you would\r\nnot omit writing to me by the Post if other safe Opportunities do\r\nnot present.\r\n\r\nYesterday we receivd a very agreeable Letter from Doctor Franklin\r\ndated at Nantes (in France) the 8th of December. By this Letter,\r\nthings appear in a very favorable Light to America in that\r\nKingdom. A general War was thought to be unavoidable. The\r\nDifferences between Spain & Portugal were not settled, although\r\nthe British Monarch (as he tells his Parliament) had been using\r\nhis Endeavors for that Purpose. The Passengers tell us it is the\r\nDetermination of the Court of France to prevent the Russian\r\nTroops from coming to America, and that General Howe can expect\r\nno Reinforcement of foreign Mercenaries this year. It is however\r\nthe Wisdom of America to prepare for the most formidable Attacks.\r\nI am sorry to tell you that the Vessel which brought us this\r\nIntelligence was taken near the Capes of Delaware, having Goods\r\non board belonging to the Continent, to what Value is not yet\r\nascertaind. We must expect Misfortunes and bear them. I make no\r\nDoubt but this Contest will end in the Establishment of American\r\nFreedom & Independence.\r\n\r\nI lately received two Letters from my Son. He writes me that he\r\nis in good Health. The Affairs of the Department he is in, will\r\nsoon be settled on a new Plan, when his Friends here say he shall\r\nbe provided for. I have told him he must expect to derive no\r\nAdvantage in point of Promotion from his Connection with me, for\r\nit is well known I have ever been averse to recommending Sons or\r\nCousins. Yet I am far from being indifferent towards him. I feel\r\nthe affection of a Father. It gives me inexpressible Pleasure to\r\nhear him so well spoken of. I hope I am not, indeed I have no\r\nReason to think that I am flatterd and deceivd.\r\n\r\nIn a former Letter you informd that our valueable Brother Mr\r\nCheckley was dangerously ill and his Life despared of. I have\r\nheard Nothing of him since, although I have enquired of Persons\r\nwho came from Providence. My worthy Friend Coll Henshaw you tell\r\nme, still lives, beyond the Expectation of his Physician and\r\nFriends. I did not promise my self the Pleasure of ever seeing\r\nhim again in this World when I left Boston. But Mr Checkley was\r\nby many years younger, and in high Health when I visited him at\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nI have been told that the Law lately made in our State has been\r\nattended with ill Consequences, and that the Inhabitants of\r\nBoston were in Danger of being starvd for Want of the necessary\r\nArticles of living from the Country; but a Letter I have just\r\nreceivd from a Friend upon whom I greatly rely, assures me that\r\nit is likely to answer the good Purposes intended. Pray, my Dear,\r\nlet me know whether you live according to your own Wishes. I am\r\nvery sollicitous concerning you.--Tell my Daughter and Sister\r\nPolly that I daily think of them. Remember me to each of my\r\nFamily and other Friends. I am\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nAfter perusing the inclosd, you will seal and send it to Miss\r\nScollay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN SCOLLAY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE March 20th 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge your Favor of the 22d of Feb. which I receivd\r\na few days ago. The Act for regulating Prices, you tell me has\r\nmade a great Convulsion especially in Boston. I am exceedingly\r\nsorry to hear that Dissentions should arise in a Community,\r\nremarkeable for its publick Spirit, and which has heretofore by\r\nthe united Exertions of Individuals repeatedly done essential\r\nServices in Support of the Liberties of America. Is it indeed\r\ntrue, my Friend, that \"Self Denial is a Virtue rarely to be seen\r\namong you\"? How great a Change in a few years! The Self Denial of\r\nthe Citizens of Boston, their Patience and long Suffering under\r\nthe cruel Oppression of the Port bill was astonishing both to\r\ntheir Friends and their Enemies. Their Firmness and Resolution in\r\nthat severe Conflict, and the Chearfulness with which they endurd\r\nthe Loss of all things, rather than the publick Liberty should\r\nsuffer by their Submission, will be handed down to their Honour\r\nin the impartial History. God forbid that they should so soon\r\nforget their own generous Feelings for the Publick and for each\r\nother, as to set private Interest in Competition with that of the\r\ngreat Community. The Country and the Town, you tell me, mutually\r\ncomplain of each other. I well remember it was the Artifice of\r\nour common Enemies to foment such Divisions but by the social\r\nInterviews of Committees of Correspondence and other Means the\r\nAffections of the Town & Country were conciliated. Indeed there\r\nis no Time for angry Disputes. While the publick Liberty is in\r\nDanger, and every thing that is sacred is threatned, the People\r\nshould, if ever, be in perfect good humour. At such a Time\r\nCitizens should not be over sollicitous concerning their seperate\r\nInterests. There should rather be an Emulation to excell each\r\nother in their Exertions for the Safety of our Country. I confess\r\nI am not sufficiently informd to make up a Judgment for myself of\r\nthe Utility of the Act in every Particular. Perhaps it would have\r\nbeen better if those necessary Articles of Life for the Supply of\r\nwhich you depend upon the Southern Colonies had been put upon a\r\nFooting with other imported Articles. As the Price of Flour for\r\nInstance is not limitted in these States, I cannot see how it can\r\nbe fixed at a certain Rate in New England without Danger of\r\ninjuring the Importer, or altogether preventing the necessary\r\nSupply of Bread. The Committees of the middle States I am told\r\nare now met, and if they should agree to regulate the Prices of\r\ntheir produce it may put it in the power of our Gen Assembly to\r\nfix them at such Rates as to enable the Merchants to supply the\r\nTown without Loss to themselves.\r\n\r\nI observe what you have written concerning the Supply of the Army\r\nwith your Mannufacture. Such Matters are out of my Line, but you\r\nmay assure your self I shall endeavor to promote your Interest as\r\nfar as it may be in my Power, for I am,\r\n\r\nYour unfeigned Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA April 1st 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI wrote to you the Week before last by the Post and since by a Mr\r\nVose of Boston. I wish to hear of your having receivd both those\r\nLetters, especially the last for a Reason which must be obvious\r\nto you if you have seen its Contents.\r\n\r\nWe have receivd the important Intelligence from New Hampshire of\r\nthe Arrival of a Vessel from France with near twelve thousand\r\nStands of Arms and a great Quantity of Powder &c. I congratulate\r\nmy Country on the occasion. By this Vessel I have a Letter from\r\nmy much esteemed Friend A. L. I will recite to you some Passages\r\nin his Letter because I recollect with how much Pleasure you used\r\nto read those which I formerly receivd from him, and because I\r\nthink the Spirit with which he writes and the intelligence\r\ncontaind in his Letter, will afford Satisfaction to you and the\r\nCircle of our Friends. \"It is certain, says he, that the Peace of\r\nEurope hangs upon a Cobweb. It is certain that, Portugal & Russia\r\nexcepted, all Europe wishes us Success. The Ports of France,\r\nSpain and the Mediterranean are open to us on the Terms of\r\nNeutrality. We have already receivd a Benevolence in this\r\nCountry, which Will enable us to Expedite and augment the Stores\r\nnecessary for your Defence.\" The Benevolence he refers to, is a\r\nvoluntary Loan of a Sum of Money in France, without Interest, and\r\nto be paid as soon as it can conveniently be done after a Peace\r\nshall be establishd. You may now remember what I wrote you from\r\nBaltimore in December last. I think we shall soon reap the happy\r\nFruits of the Determinations of Congress at that time. My Friend\r\ntells me \"It is with Pleasure he revives a Correspondence which\r\nthe particular Situation of Affairs has so long interrupted.\" His\r\nLetter is dated in Paris the 21st of January. I had before\r\nwritten to him on the 2d of the same Month, being then fully\r\nsatisfied that mine, if no ill Accident happend, would find him\r\nin that Place. I then observd to him that our Country had called\r\nhim to act in a more enlarged Sphere. He soon after informs me\r\nthat he had \"obeyed the Call of Congress into THE IMMEDIATE\r\nSERVICE of our Country.\" What this Service is our Friends will\r\nconjecture. You may assure them that Matters merely commercial\r\nare not in the Line of HIS Genius. In my Letter, I remark to him\r\nthat our Country is now enduring the sharp Conflict, confiding\r\nthat righteous Heaven will never look with an indifferent Eye\r\nupon a Cause so manifestly just, and so interresting to Mankind.\r\nIn his Letter, he tells me with the Spirit of Prediction \"When\r\nwith Roman Fortitude & Magnanimity we refuse to treat with\r\nHannibal at our Gates, he looks forward to Roman Greatness.\" I am\r\nperswaded that these united States will never treat with any\r\nPower which will not acknowledge their Independence. The\r\nInhabitants of Boston, who have heretofore acted so\r\ndisinterrested and patriotick a Part will Surely persevere in\r\nsupporting this all important Cause. America has already the\r\nApplause of the virtuous and the brave. If we are not wanting to\r\nourselves, we may be assured of the Smiles of Heaven. However\r\nready some of the Powers of Europe may be to aid us in this\r\nglorious Struggle, it will certainly in the End be best for us,\r\nif we can save ourselves by our own Exertions. Our Sufferings\r\nwill indeed be greater if we are left to ourselves, but the more\r\ndearly we purchase our Liberties, the more we shall prize them\r\nand the longer we shall preserve them.\r\n\r\nYesterday an unhappy Man was executed here for attempting to\r\nentice some of the Pilots to enter into the Service of Lord Howe.\r\nHe was first examined by the Board of War, and afterwards tried\r\nby a Court Martial and condemned. The Pilots pretended to him\r\nthat they were in earnest till the Bargain was made and he had\r\ngiven them the Bribe. They then seizd him and had him committed\r\nto Goal. Before his Execution the whole Proceedings of the Court\r\nwere laid before Congress and the judgment was approvd of. The\r\nEvidence against him was full and clear, but not more so than his\r\nown Confession. He said that he had been at New York about a\r\nMonth before he was detected, and that Mr Galloway, a Man of\r\nFortune & a noted Tory in this State, who last Winter went over\r\nto the Enemy, was his Adviser there. No Doubt there were others\r\nhere who secretly abetted & supported him. Some ordinary Persons,\r\nI am told have disappeard since this Mans Detection.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported here these few days past that Lord Howe is\r\ngone to England, and it is thought by some to be probable upon\r\nthis Circumstance that a new Proclamation has made its Appearance\r\nsignd William Howe only.\r\n\r\nI am informd that General Carleton and his Brother have been very\r\nill used and are greatly disgusted with the British Court. That\r\nLord George Sackvill and all the Scotch hate them, and they him.\r\nYou remember the old Proverb.\r\n\r\nI am afraid, my dear, I have tired your Patience with a Letter\r\naltogether upon political Matters. I have only time to tell you\r\nthat I remain in good Health & Spirits--Believe me\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nApril 2d\r\n\r\nYour Kind Letter of the 19th of March is just come to my hand-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATHANIEL GREENE.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE May 12 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nAmidst your Hurry of Business and my own, I cannot help\r\nwithdrawing myself for a Moment to throw on paper a single\r\nSentiment for your Consideration. Europe and America seem to be\r\napplauding our Imitation of the Fabian Method of carrying on this\r\nWar without considering as I conceive the widely different\r\nCircumstances of the Carthaginian & the British Generals. It will\r\nrecur to your Memory that the Faction of Hanno in Carthage\r\nprevented Hannibals receiving the Supplys from them which he had\r\na Right to expect and his Necessities requird. This left him to\r\nthe Resources of his own Mind, and obligd him to depend upon such\r\nSupplys as he could procure from the Italians. Under such a\r\nCircumstance, it was the Wisdom of Fabius to put himself in the\r\nState of Defence but by no means of Inactivity--by keeping a\r\nwatchful Eye upon Hannibal and cutting off his foraging & other\r\nParties by frequent Skirmishes he had the strongest Reason to\r\npromise himself the Ruin of his Army without any Necessity of\r\nrisqueing his own by a general Engagement. But General Howe (who\r\nby the way I am not about to compare to Hannibal as a Soldier)\r\nhas at all times the best Assurances of Supplies from Britain.\r\nThere is no Faction there to disappoint him and the British Navy\r\nis powerful enough to protect Transports & provision Vessels\r\ncoming to him. Hannibal despaird of Reinforcements from Carthage,\r\nbut Howe has the fullest Assurances of early reinforcements from\r\nBritain & cannot fail of receiving them, unless a general War has\r\ntaken place which I think is at least problematical. They are\r\nexpected every Day. Would Fabius, if he were his Enemy, pursue\r\nthe Method he took with the Carthaginian General? Would he not\r\nrather attend to the present Circumstances, and by destroying the\r\nArmy in Brunswick prevent as much as possible the Enemy\r\nincreasing in Strength even if reinforcements should arrive or\r\nputing a total End to the Campaign if they should not. I am\r\nsensible our own Circumstances have been such, thro' the Winter\r\npast, as to make it impracticable to attempt any thing, but I\r\nhope we are or shall be very soon in a Condition to take a\r\ndecisive part, and I do not entertain any Doubt but we shall see\r\nsuch an enterprizing Spirit as will confound our Enemies and give\r\nAssurances to the Friends of Liberty & Mankind that we still\r\nretain a just Sense of our own Dignity and the Dignity of our\r\nCause and are resolvd by God's Assistance to support it at all\r\nHazzards.\r\n\r\nI am, &c\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n1Adressed to General Greene at Morristown, New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE June 17, 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI am disappointed in not receiving a Letter from you by\r\nyesterdays Post. The Fears you expressd in your last of the\r\nArrival of Burgoin gave me Uneasiness. We receivd Advice from our\r\nFriends in France which gave us some Reason to apprehend the\r\nIntention of the Enemy was to attack Boston, and we thought it\r\nnecessary to give timely Notice of it. I hope the People there\r\nwill always be so much on their Guard as to prepare for the\r\nworst, but I think you will not be in Danger this Summer. This\r\nCity has been given out as their Object. Last Saturday General\r\nHowe with the main Body of his Army marchd from Brunswick to\r\nSomerset Court House about 8 Miles on the Road to Cariel's Ferry\r\nwith an Intention as it was thought to cross the Delaware there,\r\nbut Genl Sullivan with about three thousand Regulars and Militia\r\ngot Possession of the post there. The Jersey Militia are coming\r\nout with great Spirit and I think the progress of the Enemy in\r\nthat way is effectually stopped--Coll Whipple will set off\r\ntomorrow for Boston & Portsmouth. If I can possibly get time I\r\nwill write by him. I am now in great Haste. I hope you duly\r\nreceivd my last enclosing one to Henry Gardner Esq.,1 and that\r\nthe Matter therein mentioned is settled to your Advantage. Give\r\nmy Love to my Daughter Sister Polly &c. Write to me by every\r\nPost. Adieu my dear & believe me to be most affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Treasurer of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA June 18 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nThis Letter will be deliverd to you by my worthy Friend Colo\r\nWhipple a Delegate of the State of New Hampshire. He is a\r\nGentleman of Candor, and wishes he could have the opportunity of\r\nconversing freely with some one of Influence in the Massachusetts\r\nBay upon Matters concerning that State particularly. To whom\r\ncould I recommend him on this Occasion with more Propriety than\r\nto your self. He will be able to give you such Information of\r\nPersons and Things as one would not chuse to throw on Paper in\r\nthis precarious Time when an Accident might turn the Intelligence\r\ninto a wrong Channel.\r\n\r\nI observe by the Boston Papers last brought to us, that you are\r\nagain placed in the Chair of the House of Representatives, with\r\nwhich I am well pleasd. Mr Paine Speaker pro Temp. Mr Hancock\r\nfirst Member of the Boston Seat and Mr T. Cushing a Councellor AT\r\nLARGE--I have the Honor of knowing but few of the Members of the\r\nHouse. I hope my Countrymen have been wise in their Elections and\r\nI pray God to bless their Endeavors for the establishment of\r\npublick Liberty Virtue & Happiness.\r\n\r\nYou will hear before this will reach you of the Motions of the\r\nEnemy. It has been the general Opinion for many Months past that\r\nthis City is the Object. Should they gain this Point what will it\r\navail them unless they beat our Army. This I am fully perswaded\r\nthey will not do. My Wish is that our Army may beat them, because\r\nit would put a glorious End to the present Campaign & very\r\nprobably the War. I confess I have always been so very wrong\r\nheaded as not to be over well pleasd with what is called the\r\nFabian War in America. I conceive a great Difference between the\r\nSituation of the Carthaginian & the British Generals. But I have\r\nno Judgment in military Affairs, and therefore will leave the\r\nSubject to be discussd, as it certainly will be, by those who are\r\nMasters of it. I can not conclude this Epistle without thanking\r\nyou for your Care in carrying a Matter in which I was interrested\r\nthrough the General Assemby of which I have been informd by our\r\nFriend Mr______.\r\n\r\nI wish to hear from you. Adieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA June 23 1777\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI wrote to you a few days ago by Colo Whipple with whom I hope\r\nyou will have free Conversation. As he must have been not far\r\nfrom the Spot, he can give you a more particular Accot than has\r\nyet been handed to us, of the late Scituation & Movements of the\r\ntwo Armies. The main Body of our Army was encampd at Middle\r\nBrook, and a considerable Force consisting of Continental Troops\r\nand Militia lay at a place called Sourland Hills within 6 Miles\r\nof the Enemy who were posted at Somersett Court House 9 miles on\r\nthis Side of Brunswick. The Right of the Enemy was at Brunswick &\r\ntheir Left at Somersett. They were well fortified on the Right\r\nand had the Raritan River in front and Millstone on the left. In\r\nthis Situation General W. tho't an Attack upon them would be\r\nattended with bad Consequences. His Design was to collect all the\r\nforces that cd possibly be drawn from other Quarters so as to\r\nreduce the Security of his Army to the greatest Certainty & to be\r\nin a Condition to embrace any fair oppty that mt offer to make an\r\nAttack on advantageous terms. In the mean time by light bodies of\r\nMilitia seconded & encouragd by a few Continental Troops to\r\nharrass & diminish their Numbers by continual Skirmishes. But the\r\nEnemy made a sudden Retreat to Brunswick and from thence with\r\ngreat Precipitation towds Amboy. All the Continental Troops at\r\nPeeks Kill except the number necessary for the Security of the\r\nPost were orderd to hasten on to the Army in Jersey & a part of\r\nthem had joynd. I am not disposd to ascribe great military Skill\r\nto Genl Howe, but if he designd to draw the whole of our Forces\r\nfrom the East to the West Side of Hudsons River, in order to gain\r\nadvantage by suddenly crossing the River with his own Army I\r\ncannot but hope they will be cut off & his Design frustrated.\r\nGreat Credit is due to the Jersey Militia who have turnd out with\r\nspirit & alacrity. I congratulate you on the Success of our State\r\nVessels of War.\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to call on Mrs A & let her know that you\r\nhave recd this Letter, for she charges me with not writing to my\r\nFriends so often as she thinks I ought.\r\n\r\nThe Watchman tells me 'tis past 12 o'Clock.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear friend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society; portions are\r\nprinted in W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. ii., pp. 470,\r\n471, 475.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA June 26 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI intended to have written to you by the last Post, but being\r\nunder a Necessity of dispatching some Letters to Boston by the\r\nEastern Post which went off the same day I was prevented. When\r\nyou left this City you may remember the Enemy was at Brunswick\r\nand our Army at a place called Middlebrook about 9 Miles North of\r\nBrunswick Since which General Howe who had joyned his Army marchd\r\nsuddenly from thence with Design as it was generally believd to\r\nmake a rapid Push for Philadelphia, but he disappointed the Hopes\r\nof some and the fears of others by halting at Somerset Court\r\nHouse about 9 Miles on the Road leading to Caryels Ferry. General\r\nSullivan who you know had been at Princeton made a quick March to\r\ncover our Boats at the Ferry and by retarding Howe's March to\r\ngive an opportunity to our Army to come up & attack them. But the\r\nEnemy continuing at Somerset Sullivan advancd with a considerable\r\nForce--consisting of Continental Troops and Militia & posted\r\nhimself at a place called Sourland hills within six Miles of\r\nSomerset Court house. The Enemy were very strongly posted, their\r\nRight at Brunswick & their Left at Somerset well fortified on the\r\nRight and having the Raritan in front and Millstone on the Left.\r\nIn this Scituation Genl W. did not think it prudent to attack\r\nthem as it did not appear to him to be warranted by a sufficient\r\nprospect of Success and he thought it might be attended with\r\nruinous Consequences. The Design then was to reduce the Security\r\nof his Army to the greatest Certainty by collecting all the\r\nForces that could be drawn from other Quarters, so as to be in a\r\nCondition of embracing any fair opportunity that mt offer to make\r\nan Attack on Advantageous Terms, and in the mean time by light\r\nBodies of Militia seconded & encouragd by a few continental\r\nTroops to harrass & diminish their Numbers by continual\r\nSkirmishes--But the Enemy made an unexpected Retreat to\r\nBrunswick, and afterwards with great Precipitation to Amboy.\r\n\r\nJune 29 ---- On Wednesday last the Enemy reinforcd, as it is\r\nsaid, with Marines, marchd from Amboy, through a Road between\r\nBrunswick and Elizabeth Town to a place called Westfield about 10\r\nMiles, with Design as it is supposd to cut off our Light Troops\r\nand bring on a General Battle, or to take Possession of the High\r\nLand back of Middlebrook, for which last purpose Westfield was\r\nthe most convenient Route and it was also a well chosen Spot from\r\nwhence to make a safe Retreat in Case he should fail of gaining\r\nhis Point. On this march they fell in with General Maxwell who\r\nthought it prudent to retreat to our main Army then at\r\nQuibbletown from whence Genl W. made a hasty march to his former\r\nStation and frustrated the supposd Design of the Enemy. I have\r\ngiven you a very general Narrative of the different Situation &\r\nMovements of the two Armies, without descending to the\r\nparticulars, because we have not as yet an Authentick Account,\r\nand one cannot depend upon the many stories that are told. I\r\nthink I may assure you that our Army is in high Spirits and is\r\ndaily growing more respectable in point of Numbers.\r\n\r\nWe are going on within Doors with Tardiness enough. A Thousand\r\nand [one] little Matters too often throw out greater ones. A kind\r\nof Fatality still prevents our proceeding a Step in the important\r\naffair of Confederation--Yesterday and the day before was wholly\r\nspent in passing Resolutions to gratify N. Y. or as they say to\r\nprevent a civil War between that State and the Green Mountain\r\nMen--A Matter which it is not worth your while to have explaind\r\nto you. Monsr D Coudrays affair is still unsettled. The four\r\nfrench Engineers are arrivd. They are said to be very clever but\r\ndisdain to be commanded by Coudray. Mr Comr D________ continuing\r\nto send us french German & Prussian officers with authenticated\r\nConventions and strong recommendations. The military Science, for\r\nyour Comfort, will make rapid Progress in America. Our Sons and\r\nNephews will be provided for in the Army and a long and moderate\r\nWar will be their happy Portion. But who my Friend, would not\r\nwish for peace. May I live to see the publick Liberty restored\r\nand the Safety of our dear Country secured. I should then think I\r\nhad enjoyd enough and bid this World Adieu.\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE June 30 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI have the Pleasure of receiving your friendly Letter of the 16\r\nInstant, and have little more than time enough barely to\r\nacknowledge the favor. There is an unaccountable Uncertainty in\r\nthe Conduct of the Post office. About a month ago I remonstrated\r\nto the Post Master General that the time allowd the Eastern\r\nDelegates to answer the Letters they receivd by the post (being\r\non the Monday between 9 & 2) was altogether spent in Congress,\r\nand requested that we might have one Evening for the purpose. He\r\ngranted it and the Post has been since detaind till tuesday\r\nMorning, but I am now informd that the former Regulation is\r\nrevivd, for what Reason I know not, and our Letters must be ready\r\nat two o'Clock. I do assure you I should hardly forgive my self,\r\ncould I reflect upon my having once neglected to write to so\r\nvalueable a Friend as you.\r\n\r\nYou wish to hear \"how our Confederation goes on.\" I do not wonder\r\nat your Anxiety to have it completed, for it appears to me to be\r\na Matter of very great Importance. We every now and then take it\r\ninto Consideration, but such a Variety of Affairs have\r\ncontinually demanded the Attention of Congress that it has been\r\nimpracticable hitherto to get thro it. There are but two or three\r\nthings which in my opinion will be the Subjects of much further\r\nDebate, and upon these I believe most if not all the Members have\r\nalready made up their Minds. One is what Share of Votes each of\r\nthe States, which differ so much in Wealth & Numbers, shall have\r\nin determining all Questions. Much has been said upon this\r\nweighty Question upon the decision of which depends the Union of\r\nthe States and the Security of the Liberty of the whole. Perhaps\r\nit would be more easy for a disinterrested Foreigner to see, than\r\nfor the united States to fix upon, the Principles upon which this\r\nQuestion ought in Equity to be decided. The Sentiments in\r\nCongress are not various, but as you will easily conceive\r\nopposite. The Question was very largely debated a few days ago,\r\nand I am apt to think it will tomorrow be determind that each\r\nState shall have one Vote, but that certain great & very\r\ninterresting Questions, shall have the concurrent Votes of nine\r\nStates for a Decision. Whether this Composition will go near\r\ntowards the Preservation of a due Ballance I wish you would\r\nconsider, for if your Life & Health is spared to your Country,\r\nyou will have a great Share in the Determination of it hereafter.\r\nYou have later Advices from abroad than we. Our last Intelligence\r\nI gave you pretty minutely in a Letter which I sent & suppose was\r\ndeliverd to you by Capt Collins.\r\n\r\nI find by the News papers that the Genl Assembly under the\r\nDenomination of a Convention are forming a new Constitution.1\r\nThis is a momentous Business, I pray God to direct you. Shall I\r\nbe favord with your own & others Sentiments upon it. I am greatly\r\nafflicted to hear that angry Disputes have arisen among my dear\r\nCountrymen, at a time especially when perfect good Humour should\r\nsubsist and every Heart and Tongue & Hand should be united in\r\npromoting the Establishment of publick Liberty & securing the\r\nfuture Safety & Happiness of our Country. I am sure you will\r\ncultivate Harmony among those who Love the Country in Sincerity.\r\nWith regard to OTHERS I will say in the apostolick Language \"I\r\nwould they were all cut off\" (banishd at least) \"that trouble\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWill it too much infringe upon your precious time to acquaint Mrs\r\nA that I am in good health & Spirits, and have not opportunity to\r\nwrite to her by this post. I am with the most friendly regards to\r\nyour Lady & Family very affectionately your Friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Columbia University Studies in History, Economics, and Public\r\nLaw, vol. vii., pp. 194-226.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 4 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI did myself the Honor to write to you on the 2d of Jany last\r\nsince which your favor of the 21st of the same month from Paris\r\ncame to my Hand. You have supposd that this Campaign would put\r\nGeneral Howe, after the Junction with Burgoyne in Possession of\r\nthe States of New York, New Jersey Pennsylvania & the Delaware\r\nwith Rhode Island as his Center of Attack upon the States of New\r\nEngland; you have even considerd such a situation of things as\r\nalmost certain. But I have now the Satisfaction of informing you\r\nthat General Howe has found it neces- sary to withdraw all his\r\nTroops from New Jersey, and I am of Opinion that it is\r\nimpracticable for him to distribute his Troops among the States\r\nyou have mentiond in sufficient Numbers to keep possession of\r\nthem and afford enough to attack the New England States with the\r\nleast Prospect of subduing them. I have thought that the\r\nImpression which the Enemy made the last Winter on the State of\r\nNew Jersey was owing to favorable Circumstances which then took\r\nplace, and was not in pursuance of the original Plan. The Time\r\nfor which our Troops were inlisted had expired--our Army was\r\nreducd to a mere handful and General Howe had flatterd himself\r\nthat the middle States were so generally disaffected to our Cause\r\nas to render their total Submission practicable & easy. He\r\ntherefore made a vigorous push in the Depth of Winter as far as\r\nTrenton upon Delaware, and there cantond his Troops with a Design\r\nprobably of availing himself of this City early in the Spring\r\nbefore we should be able to collect a force sufficient to prevent\r\nit. But General Washington, having gaind a signal Advantage by an\r\nAttack as you have heard obligd him to retreat and make his\r\nremaining Winter Quarters in Brunswick, since which the Vigilance\r\n& Activity of the people of Jersey who by frequent Skirmishes\r\nhave lessend his Army, has given him reason to alter his opinion\r\nof their Disposition & his removing from thence has I think\r\nafforded sufficient Proof that he has not been able by Arts or\r\nArms to conquer even one of our smallest States. What his next\r\nStep will be is uncertain, perhaps he may embark his Troops for\r\nPhiladelphia, or more probably he may attempt a Junction with\r\nBurgoyne. If the first, has he to expect more Laurels or better\r\nSuccess than he gaind in Jersey? Or, if the latter should be his\r\nChoice judge what must be his Prospect. Burgoyne who it is said\r\ncannot muster more than 7 or 8 thousand will be opposd by our\r\nNorthern Army & I hope overwhelmd before they can reach Albany.\r\nHowe will be followd close by the Army under the immediate\r\nCommand of G W, at present more than equal it in number, in high\r\nSpirits, full of the Idea of Victory and daily increasing. Under\r\nthese unpromising Circumstances should he even complete a\r\nJunction, he will then have to begin an attempt of the most\r\narduous Business of conquering the whole Army of the united\r\nStates together with the numerous, hardy & stubborn Militia of\r\nNew England. These are my Views of the present State of our\r\nmilitary affairs, and I am perswaded, when I reflect on the\r\nSpirit & Valor discoverd in my Countrymen of Georgia So & No\r\nCarolina Virginia & Jersey to say nothing of Lexington & Bunker\r\nHill in my own dear native State, Great Britain will ever show\r\nher self feeble in her Efforts to conquer America. I beg you to\r\nwrite to me full as often as you may find Leisure, and for my own\r\npart I feel a Disposition almost to persecute you with my Letters\r\nbut I must conclude with congratulating you on this first\r\nAnniversary of American Independence, and assuring you that I am\r\nunfeignedly and very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL HEWES.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA July 7 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI intreat you to ascribe my not having yet acknowledgd the\r\nReceipt of your favor1 to the true Cause, a perpetual Hurry of\r\naffairs. I have not been unmindful of its Contents. Major Ward,\r\nas you have heard, is appointed Commissary General of Musters\r\nwith the Rank and Pay of a Colonel. I have long known him a Man\r\nof Sense and a zealous and steady Patriot, in Times less\r\npromising than the present; and the Part he took on the ever\r\nmemorable 19th of April 75, together with the Experience he has\r\ngaind by constant Application ever since in the military Line,\r\nintitles him to particular Notice. I will bear in my Memory the\r\nHint given in the Close of your Letter. If at any Time I may have\r\nit in my power to render benefit to a Friend by puting him in the\r\nWay of serving our Country it will afford me double Satisfaction.\r\nYou will have heard before this reaches you that General Howe has\r\nat length drawn all his Forces from the State of Jersey to New\r\nYork. It is the Business of General Washington to penetrate his\r\nfuture Design. This City has been threatned for some Months past;\r\nif he ever had such an Intention, it is probable he has now laid\r\nit aside, and that he will attempt to force a Junction with\r\nBurgoyne, and subdue the Eastern States. [But] why should I\r\nhazzard a Conjecture of this kind who profess no Skill in\r\nmilitary affairs. I hope my Countrymen are prepared to give the\r\nEnemy a proper Reception whenever they may be attackd!\r\n\r\nI have written you a friendly Letter though a short one--short\r\nfor want of time to write more. I have twenty things to say to\r\nyou but at present must conclude with most respectful Complts to\r\nyour Lady Family & Connections very cordially your friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of March 25, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PITTS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 8 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI do not recollect to have receivd a Letter from [you] of a later\r\nDate than the 25 of Decr last, although I have been since writing\r\nto you as often as I cod find Leisure. I do not know that I have\r\nby any thing I have written given you just Cause of offence. If\r\nyou think otherwise pray let me know it, and I will make as full\r\nAtonement as I am able, for I do assure you I wish to continue a\r\nfriendly epistolary Correspondence with you. Be so kind as to\r\nwrite me by the very next Post and assure yourself that I am\r\nunfeignedly and most cordially,\r\n\r\nYr Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Emmet Collection, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 15 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI wrote to you a Fortnight ago in so great Haste that I had not\r\ntime to transcribe or correct it and relied on your Candor to\r\noverlook the slovenly Dress in which it was sent to you. You have\r\nsince heard that our Friends in Jersey have at length got rid of\r\nas vindictive and cruel an Enemy as ever invaded any Country. It\r\nwas the opinion of General Gates that Howes advancing to Somerset\r\nCourt House was a Feint to cover the Retreat of his Battering\r\nTrain, ordinary Stores and heavy Baggage to Amboy. I confess I\r\ncan not help yet feeling myself chagrind, that in more . . . .\r\ndiminish his paltry Army in that State. If their Militia, among\r\nwhom so great an Animation prevaild, had been let loose upon the\r\nEnemy, who knows but that they wd have destroyd their Army, or at\r\nleast, so far have weakend it as to have put a glorious End to\r\nthis Campaign, and perhaps the War? I will acknowledge that my\r\nTemper is rather sanguine. I am apt to be displeasd when I think\r\nour Progress in War and in Politicks is Slow. I wish to see more\r\nof an enterprising Spirit in the Senate and the Field, without\r\nwhich, I fear our Country will not speedily enjoy the Fruits of\r\nthe present Conflict--an establishd Independence and Peace. I\r\ncannot applaud the Prudence of the Step, when the People of\r\nJersey were collected, and inspired with Confidence in themselves\r\n& each other, to dismiss them as not being immediately wanted,\r\nthat they might go home in good Humour and be willing to turn out\r\nagain in any OTHER Emergency. I possess not the least Degree of\r\nKnowledge in military Matters, & therefore hazzard no opinion. I\r\nrecollect however that Shakespear tells us, there is a Tide in\r\nhuman Affairs, an Opportunity which wise Men carefully watch for\r\nand improve, and I will never forget because it exactly coincides\r\nwith my religious opinion and I think is warranted by holy writ,\r\nthat \"God helps those who help themselves.\"\r\n\r\nWe have letters from General Schuyler in the Northern Department\r\ngiving us an Account of the untoward Situation of our Affairs in\r\nthat Quarter & I confess it is no more than I expected, when he\r\nwas again intrusted with the Command there. You remember it was\r\nurged by some that as he had a large Interest and powerful\r\nConnections in that Part of the Country, no one could so readily\r\navail himself of Supplys for an Army there, than he. A most\r\nsubstantial Reason, I think, why he should have been appointed a\r\nQuartermaster or a Commissary. But it seems to have been the\r\nprevailing Motive to appoint him to the Chief Command! You have\r\nhis Account in the inclosed Newspaper, which leaves us to GUESS\r\nwhat is become of the GARRISON. It is indeed droll enough to see\r\na General not knowing where to find the main Body of his Army.\r\nGates is the Man of my Choice. He is HONEST and TRUE, & has the\r\nArt of GAINING THE LOVE OF HIS SOLDIERS principally because he is\r\nALWAYS PRESENT with them in FATIGUE & DANGER. But Gates has been\r\ndisgusted! We are however waiting to be relievd from this\r\ndisagreeable State of uncertainty, by a particular Account of\r\nFacts from some Person who WAS NEAR the Army who trusts not to\r\nMEMORY altogether, lest some Circumstances may be OMITTED while\r\nothers are MISAPPREHENDED.\r\n\r\nI rejoyce in the Honors your Country has done you. Pray hasten\r\nyour Journey hither.\r\n\r\nYour very affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 15 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nBefore this reaches you, it is probable you will have heard of\r\nthe untoward Turn our Affairs have taken at the Northward. I\r\nconfess it is not more than I expected when Genl Schur was again\r\nintrusted with the Command there. But it was thought by some\r\nGentlemen that as he had a great Interest & large Connections in\r\nthat Part of the Country, he could more readily avail himself of\r\nSupplys for an Army there as well as Reinforcements if wanted\r\nupon an Emergency, than any other Man. You have the Account in\r\nthe inclosed Paper, which leaves us to guess what is become of\r\nthe Garrison. There is something droll enough in a Generals not\r\nknowing where to find the main Body of his Army. Gates is the Man\r\nI should have chosen. He is honest and true, & has the Art of\r\ngaining the Love of his Soldiers, principally because he is\r\nalways present and shares with them in Fatigue & Danger. We are\r\nhourly expecting to be relievd from a disagreable State of\r\nUncertainty by a particular Relation of Facts. This Account, as\r\nyou are told, is related upon MEMORY, & therefore some\r\nCircumstances may be OMITTED, others MISAPPREHENDED. But the Post\r\nis just going, & I have time only to acknowledge the Receipt of\r\nyour favor of the 12 of June & beg you would write to me often.\r\n\r\nI am affectionately,\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; the text, dated July\r\n12, 1777, is in W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. ii., pp.\r\n484-486.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA July 22 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour very acceptable Letter of the 12th came to my hand\r\nyesterday. The Confederation, is most certainly an important\r\nObject, and ought to be attended to & finishd speedily. I moved\r\nthe other Day and urgd that it might then be brought on; but your\r\nColleague Colo H opposed and prevented it, Virginia not being\r\nrepresented. It is put off till you shall arrive; you see\r\ntherefore the Necessity of your hastening to Congress.\r\n\r\nWe have still further & still confused Accounts from the\r\nNorthward. Schuylers Letters are rueful indeed! even to a great\r\nDegree, and with such an awkward Mixture as would excite one to\r\nlaugh in the Midst of Calamity. He seems to contemplate his own\r\nHappiness in not having had much or indeed any Hand in the\r\nunhappy Disaster. He throws Blame on St Clare in his Letter of\r\nJuly 9th. \"What adds to my Distress is, that a Report prevails\r\nthat I had given orders for the Evacuation of Tyconderoga,\r\nwhereas not the most distant Hint of any such Intention can be\r\ndrawn from any of my Letters to General Sinclare or any other\r\nPerson whatever.\" He adds \"What could induce the General Officers\r\nto a Step that has ruind our Affairs in that Quarter, God only\r\nknows.\" And indeed Sinclares own Letter of the 30th of June dated\r\nat Ty. would induce one to be of the same Opinion, for he there\r\nsays \"My People are in the best Disposition possible and I have\r\nno Doubt about giving a good Account of the Enemy should they\r\nthink proper to attack us.\" Other Parts of his Letter are written\r\nin the same spirited Stile. The General Officers blame N E for\r\nnot furnishing their Quota of Troops. It is natural for Parties\r\nto shift the Fault from one to the other; and your Friend General\r\nSteven, who seems desirous of clearing his Countryman from all\r\nBlame, in a Letter to your Brother says \"Eight thousand Men were\r\nthought adequate to the Purpose. They (N E) furnishd about three\r\nthousand--for Want of the Quota the Place is lost & they stand\r\nanswerable for the Consequences.\" The General forgets that five\r\nof the ten Regiments orderd from Mass. Bay were countermanded and\r\nare now at Peeks Kill. I will give you an Abstract of the Forces\r\nat Ty & Mount Independence the 25th of June taken from the\r\nMuster-master General Colo Varicks Return.\r\n\r\nFit for Duty of the 9 Continental Regiments Commissiond & Non\r\ncommissiond & Staff Officers included 2738\r\n\r\nColo Wells' & Leonard's Regiments of Militia [their time\r\nexpired the 6th of July] 637\r\n\r\nColo Long's Regimt of Militia [engagd to 1st of Augt] 199\r\n\r\nMajor Stephens' Corps of Artillery 151\r\n\r\n5 Companies of Artificers 178\r\n\r\nWhitcombs Aldrichs & Lees Rangers 70\r\n_____\r\n3973\r\n\r\nMen at Out Posts not included in the Above 218\r\n\r\nSick in Camp and Barracks 342\r\n_____\r\n4533\r\n\r\nBesides a Number of Recruits belonging to the Continental\r\nRegiments arrivd at Ty. between the 18th & 29th of June, that are\r\nnot included in the above Abstract. General Schuyler in his\r\nLetter of the 9th of July says, \"I am informd FROM UNDOUBTED\r\nAUTHORITY that the Garrison was reinforced with twelve Hundred\r\nMen AT LEAST, two days before the Evacuation.\" When the Commander\r\nin chiefe writes in so positive Terms, one would presume upon his\r\ncertain knowledge of Facts; BUT AS HE WAS NOT PRESENT WITH HIS\r\nARMY, let us suppose (though it does not seem probable by the\r\ngeneral gloomy Cast of his Letters) that he has overrated the\r\nNumbers, and set down 967 and it would complete the Number Of\r\n5500. Deduct the sick 342, and I am willing also to deduct the\r\ntwo \"licentious and disorderly\" Regiments from Massachusetts who\r\nleft Sinclare, though he acknowledges they kept with him two days\r\nupon the March, and there remaind near five thousand. Mentioning\r\nthis yesterday in a publick Assembly, I was referrd to the\r\nGenerals Information to his Council of War, who says \"the whole\r\nof our Force consisted of two thousand & Eighty nine effective\r\nRank & file.\" But allowing this to be the Case, Is an Army the\r\nworse for having more than one half of its Combatants Officers?\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Nothing is said of it in the publick Letters Genl\r\nSinclair writes to his private Friend that the Enemy came up with\r\nthe Rear of the retreating Army, & a hot Engagement ensued. Other\r\nAccounts say that many were killed on both sides, that our Troops\r\nbeat off the Enemy & that Colo Francis of the Massachusetts &\r\nsome of his officers were among the slain.\r\n\r\nI shall not write you any more Letters for I hope to see you\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PAUL REVERE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 28 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI receivd your favor of the 26th of June and also one from Colo\r\nCrafts of the same Date. I wrote to him by the Return of the Post\r\n& desired him to communicate the Contents to you. I conversd with\r\nMr J A upon the Subject of your Letter, and we venturd, both of\r\nus, to step out of the Line of strict order in a Debate in\r\nCongress the other day, to bring your Regiment of Artillery into\r\nView. It occasiond a Conversation in the House in which we had a\r\nOpportunity of acquainting the Members of the long Standing of\r\nthat Regiment & the Seniority of its Officers. But still it was\r\nconsiderd as a Regiment raisd by a State & not by the Continent.\r\nAnd though we caused the Merit of it to be well understood & it\r\nwas acknowledgd in the House, the Difficulty of altering the\r\nRegulation you refer to appeard so evidently in the Minds of the\r\nGentlemen, that we waved making any Motion at that time, because\r\nwe apprehended that the Issue would be unfavorable. Indeed I am\r\nof Opinion that Congress will not be induced to make the\r\nAlteration you wish for, until it shall become a Continental\r\nRegiment. In that Case, I am apt to think there would be no\r\nDifficulty with Regard to the Seniority of other Regiments which\r\nhave been raisd since, over yours. But till that is done, it is\r\nfeared that an Alteration in this Instance would cause Discontent\r\nin other States, where it is said there are Instances similar. A\r\nRegiment of Artillery raisd in this State under Command of Colo\r\nProcter was lately taken into Continental Service and the\r\nCommissions were dated at the time they were raisd. It was upon\r\nthis Occasion that Colo Crafts Regiment was mentiond; and I\r\nsuppose that Regiment wd be admitted on the same terms. But I\r\nthink I foresee an insuperable Obstacle in that Case. If any\r\nthing can be done consistently with the general Service, to show\r\nHonor, but especially to do Justice to the Regiment of Artillery\r\nin Boston, I shall not fail to push it as far as I may have\r\nInfluence. My fellow Citizens well know that I have never been\r\nindifferent TO THEM. I am thought here in a great Degree partial\r\nin their Favour. I have in particular a Predilection for that\r\nRegiment. But my Friend, let me intreat you and the Gentlemen of\r\nyour Core, above all other feelings to cherish those of the\r\nvirtuous Citizen. I will allow that the Ambition of the Soldier\r\nis laudable. At such a Crisis as this it is necessary. But may it\r\nnot be indulgd to Excess? This War we hope will be of short\r\nDuration. We are contending, not for Glory, but for Liberty\r\nSafety & Happiness of our Country. The Soldier should not lose\r\nthe Sentiments of the Patriot; and the Pride of Military Rank as\r\nwell as civil Promotion should forever give Way to the publick\r\nGood. Be assured that I am very cordially,\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 31 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIt is a long time since I had the pleasure of a Letter from you.\r\nI have not heard your opinion of the Evacuation of Tyconderoga.\r\nYou are doubtless chagrind as much as I am. It is ascribd to\r\ndifferent Causes. Congress is determined that the true Reasons\r\nshall be enquird into, and the Conduct of the General Officers.\r\nSch--rs friends are endeavoring to clear him from all Blame,\r\nbecause, say they, HE WAS NOT THERE. This is true, and as it was\r\nwell known, that he had never been used to keep himself near his\r\nArmy, perhaps it may be pertinently asked, Why HE was pitchd upon\r\nto take the Command. YOUR Delegates, I can assure you, were\r\nutterly against it. And Notwithstanding it was publishd in some\r\nof the Boston News papers, said to be warranted by a Letter from\r\nthis City, that Schr had the entire Confidence of Congress, there\r\nwere five only of 11 States present, in favor of it. The paper I\r\nthink was of the 5 of June. I wish I could know who gave the\r\nLetter to the Printer. In order, I suppose, to give Credit to\r\nthat Letter, there was another publication in the papers here,\r\ninforming the World, that when he set off for the Northern\r\nDepartment he was accompanied by ----- and several other Members\r\nof C-----, which I take for granted is true. These are trifling\r\npolitical Manuevres similar to those which we have seen practicd\r\nin the Mass Bay when a prop was wanted for a sinking Character.\r\nYou may think them not worth your Notice. Excuse my troubling you\r\nwith them. Cunning Politicians often make use of the Names of\r\nPersons, & sometimes of the Persons themselves who have not the\r\nleast Suspicion of it, to serve their own Purposes. When I\r\nmentiond 5 out of 11 I shd have explaind my self. There were 5\r\nfor the measure 4 against it & 2 divided. Had not the state of\r\nRhode Island been at an equal Division, which wd have prevented\r\nthe Measure. The most important Events sometimes depend upon\r\nsmall Circumstances. Some Gentn of the State of N Y are\r\nexceedingly attachd to Genl Schr. They represent him as Instar\r\nOmnium in the Northern Departmt. But after all that has been\r\nsaid, I conceive of him, as I have for a long time, excellently\r\nwell qualified for [a] Commissary or Quartermaster. The N E\r\nDelegates were (perhaps one excepted) to a Man against his having\r\nthe Command of that Army. But [of] this I will write particularly\r\nin another Letter.\r\n\r\nI am not willing to prejudge; but I must say, it is difficult to\r\nreconcile the sudden Evacuation of the Fortress with the previous\r\nflattering Letters of General St Clair. In one of his Letters\r\nwritten but a few days before, he says, \"My People are in the\r\nbest Disposition possible, and I have no Doubt about giving a\r\ngood Account of the Enemy if they shall think proper to attack\r\nus.\" He has been esteemd here a good Officer, & in his Letter he\r\nbespeaks the Candor of the publick till he can be heard. Pains\r\nwill be taken to lay the Blame upon the N E States, for not\r\nfurnishing a sufficient Quota of Men. I wish therefore you wd\r\nprocure for me an authentick Accot of the Number of Men, both\r\nregular & Militia, sent to the Northward from our State, and how\r\nthey were cloathd and armd. You may remember that Congress\r\nrecommended it to the Eastern States, some time, I think in Decr\r\nlast, to send a Reinforcemt, of 4500 Militia to Ty. to remain\r\nthere till they cod be replaced by Continental Troops then\r\nraising. I have never been informd of the Effect of that\r\nRecommendation; or if I have been informd I do not recollect it.\r\nPray put it in our Power to state Facts precisely so far as they\r\nregard our State. It is agreed on all sides that a Fault lies\r\nsomewhere. I hope the Truth will be thoroughly investigated, and,\r\nto use the homely Proverb, the Saddle laid on the right Horse.\r\n\r\nWe are looking every hour for the Arrival of the Enemy in this\r\nRiver. 255 sail were seen on Wednesday last steering from the\r\nHook S. E. Seventy sail were seen from the shore near Egg Harbour\r\n& about 15 or 20 Leagues from these Capes on Saturday steering\r\nthe same Course--the Wind agt them. They cod not come here at a\r\nbetter time. G Washington is drawing his Troops into this\r\nNeighborhood. Some of them are arrivd. But as the Enemy has the\r\nAdvantage of us by Sea, it s too easy for them to oblige us to\r\nharrass our Men by long & fruitless Marches, and I shd not wonder\r\nto hear that they have tackd about & gone Eastward. I hope my\r\nCountrymen are prepared. LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Augt 1--77\r\n\r\nDR SR\r\n\r\nI wrote to you on the 30th Ulto by Mr Bruce who did not leave the\r\nCity on that Day as I expected. His Stay gives me an Oppty of\r\nacquainting you that an Express who left the Capes yesterday\r\ninforms us that the enemies ships all went out to Sea in the\r\nmorning steering E N E supposd to be going to Hudsons River Rh\r\nlsland or Boston. Mr B will give you as particular an Acct as I\r\ncan. I therefore refer you to him. This is what I expected. I\r\ntrust you are upon your Guard. Con. has orderd an Enquiry be made\r\ninto the reasons . . . . that Schr St Clair . . . . . . . . .\r\nrepair to Head Qrs & that G W order such Genl officer as he shall\r\nthink proper immediately to repair to the Nn Departmt to relieve\r\nSchr in his Command there. A Come is appointed to digest & rept\r\nthe Mode of conducting the Enquiry.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me difficult to account for the Evacuation of these\r\nposts even upon the principle of Cowardice. The whole Conduct\r\nseems to carry the evident Marks of Deliberation & Design.\r\n\r\nIf we are vigilant active spirited & decisive, I yet flatter my\r\nself, notwithstanding the present vexatious Situation of our\r\nAffrs at the northwd we shall humble our Enemies this Campaign. I\r\nam truly mortified at their leaving this place because I think we\r\nwere fully prepared for it, & I believe the Cowardly Rascals knew\r\nit. May Heaven prosper our Righteous Cause.

There is strong\r\nReason however to Promise ourselves by the Assistance of Heaven a\r\nfavorable Issue. Men of Virtue throughout Europe heartily wish\r\nwell to our Cause. They look upon it, as indeed it is, the Cause\r\nof Mankind. Liberty seems to be expelled from every other part of\r\nthe Globe & the Prospect of our affording an Asylum for its\r\nFriends in this new World, gives them universal Joy. France &\r\nSpain are in reality though not yet openly yielding us Aid.\r\nNevertheless, it is my Opinion, that it would be more for the\r\nfuture Safety as well as the Honor of the united States of\r\nAmerica, if they would establish their Liberty & Independence,\r\nwith as little foreign Aid as possible. If we can struggle\r\nthrough our Difficulties & establish our selves alone we shall\r\nvalue our Liberties so dearly bought, the more, and be the less\r\nobligd & consequently the more independent on others. Much\r\ndepends upon the Efforts of this year. Let us therefore lay aside\r\nthe Consideration of every Subject, which may tend to a Disunion.\r\nThe Reasons of the Scrutiny. Congress have orderd an Enquiry &\r\nfor this purpose Generals Schuyler & St. Clair are orderd to Head\r\nQuarters. Gates immediately takes the Command of the Northern\r\nArmy. He gains the Esteem of the Soldiers and his Success in\r\nrestoring the Army there the last year from a State of Confusion\r\n& Sickness to Health & good order, affords a flattering Prospect.\r\nIn my opinion he is an honest & able Officer. Bad as our Affairs\r\nin that Quarter appear to be, they are not ruinous. Reinforcemts\r\nof regular Troops are already gone from Peeks Kill, and I hope\r\nthe brave N E Militia will joyn in sufficient Numbers, to damp\r\nthe Spirits of Burgoin. One grand Effort now may put an End to\r\nthis Conflict.\r\n\r\nI am &c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LANGDON.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE August 7, 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nMajor Bass will be kind enough to deliver to you this Letter. He\r\nbrought me a very friendly Message from you, for which I return\r\nyou my hearty Thanks. If I had Inclination or Leisure to write a\r\nLetter of Compliment, I am sure you would not be pleasd with it.\r\nThe Times are very serious; our Affairs are in a critical\r\nSituation. The Enemy, after long promising a Visit to this City,\r\nmade an Appearance last Week near the Capes of Delaware. But they\r\nhave not been seen these six days past. The Hounds are in fault\r\nand have lost Scent of them. We shall hear where they engage, I\r\ndare say, before long. It belongs to the military Gentlemen to\r\nfrustrate their Design. I think they could not have come here in\r\na better time, because we were well prepared for them. General\r\nWashington had drawn his Forces into the Neighborhood of this\r\nPlace, and I verily believe, the people here, divided and\r\ndistracted as they are about their internal Government, would\r\nhave joynd in sufficient Numbers to have given a good Account of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe shameful Defeat of our Forces at Ticonderoga is not more\r\ndistressing to us than it is vexatious. A thorough Scrutiny into\r\nthe Causes of it must and will be made. For this Purpose Schuyler\r\nand St Clair are orderd to Head Quarters. I confess I cannot at\r\npresent account for it even upon the Principle of Cowardice.\r\nThere seems to me to be the evident Marks of Design. Bad as our\r\nAffairs are in that Quarter they are not desperate. Gates is gone\r\nto take the Command. He is an honest and able officer; always\r\nbelovd by his Soldiers because he always shares with them in\r\nFatigue and Danger. This has not been said of his immediate\r\nPredecessor. I hope the N England States will once more make a\r\ngenerous Exertion, and if they do I am deceivd if Burgoyns\r\nProsperity does not soon prove his Ruin.\r\n\r\nOur Intelligence from Europe is very flattering to us. The\r\nvirtuous and sensible there universally wish well to our Cause.\r\nThey say we are fighting for the Liberty and Happiness of\r\nMankind. We are at least, contending for the Liberty & Happiness\r\nof our own Country and Posterity. It is a glorious Contest. We\r\nshall succeed if we are virtuous. I am infinitely more\r\napprehensive of the Contagion of Vice than the Power of all other\r\nEnemies. It is the Disgrace of human Nature that in most\r\nCountries the People are so debauchd, as to be utterly unable to\r\ndefend or enjoy their Liberty.\r\n\r\nPay my respects to Coo Whipple. He promisd to write to me. I hope\r\nhe will soon have Leisure to fulfill his promise. A Letter from\r\nyou would oblige me much. Adieu.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Of Portsmouth, New Hampshire; member of the Continental\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Augt 8 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI have lately written to you by every Opportunity and am\r\ndetermined to omit none for the future, till I shall have the\r\nPleasure of seeing you, which I intend some time in the Fall. We\r\nhave heard Nothing of the Enemies Fleet since this Day Week.\r\nGeneral Gates is gone to take the Command of the Northern Army in\r\nthe Room of Schuyler . . . Gates has always been belovd by his\r\nSoldiers & I hope will restore our Affairs there; for although\r\nthey are in a Situation bad enough I do not think them desperate.\r\nHe is empowerd to call on the N England Militia, who I hope will\r\nonce more make a generous Effort. If they do, I am mistaken if\r\nBurgoyns present Success does not [prove his ruin.] A Change of\r\nOfficers, I dare say, will give new Spirits [to] the Men. But I\r\nforget that I am writing [to] a female upon the Subject of War. I\r\nknow your whole Soul is engagd in the great Cause. May Heaven\r\nprosper it! Adieu my dear,\r\n\r\nMy Respects to my\r\nFamily & Friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROGER SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Library of Massachusetts Historical Society; a draft is in\r\nthe Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Augt 11. 1777\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI duly receivd your obliging Letter of the 11th of July. I thank\r\nyou for the favor, and beg you to continue to write to me as\r\noften as your Leisure will admit of it. The Rumour you mention'd\r\nhas since appeard to be a serious Fact. We have lost\r\nTi[c]onderoga, and as far as I can yet judge, shamefully: I was\r\ngoing to add, vilainously; for indeed I cannot account for it,\r\nbut upon the worst of Principles. The whole appears to me to\r\ncarry the evident Marks of Design. But I hope & believe it will\r\nundergo the strictest Scrutiny. The People at large ought not,\r\nthey will not be satisfied, until a thorough Inquiry is made into\r\nthe Causes of an Event in which their Honor and Safety is so\r\ndeeply interested. The only Letter receivd by Congress from St\r\nClair, you have seen publishd under their Sanction. Schuyler has\r\nwritten a Series of weak & contemptible THINGS in a Stile of\r\nDespondence which alone, I think, is sufficient for the Removal\r\nof him from that Command; for if his Pen expresses the true\r\nFeelings of his Heart, it cannot be expected that the bravest\r\nVeterans would fight under such a General, admitting they had no\r\nSuspicion of Treachery. In a Letter dated the 4th Instant at\r\nStill Water, he writes in a Tone of perfect Despair. He seems to\r\nhave no Confidence in his Troops, nor the States from whence\r\nReinforcements are to be drawn. A third Part of his Continental\r\nTroops, he tells us, consists \"of Boys Negroes & aged Men not fit\r\nfor the Field or any other Service.\" \"A very great Part of the\r\nArmy naked--without Blanketts--ill armed and very deficient in\r\nAccoutrements: without a Prospect of Reliefe.\" \"Many, too Many of\r\nthe Officers wod be a Disgrace to the most contemptible Troops\r\nthat ever was collected.\" The Exertions of others of them of a\r\ndifferent Character \"counteracted by the worthless.\" \"Genl\r\nBurgoyne is bending his Course this Way. He will probably be here\r\nin Eight Days, and unless we are well reinforced\" (which he does\r\nnot expect) \"as much farther as he pleases to go.\"---Was ever any\r\npoor general more mortified! But he has by this Time receivd his\r\nQuietus. Gates takes the Command there, agreeably to what you\r\ntell me is the Wish of the People; and I trust our Affairs in\r\nthat Quarter will soon wear a more promising Aspect.\r\n\r\nThe Enemies Ships, upwards Of 200 sail, after having been out of\r\nSight six Days, were discoverd on Thursday last, off Sinapuxint\r\n15 Leagues from the Capes of Delaware Steering towards Chesapeake\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nYour Friends here are well, except Colo Williams, who has been\r\nconfined a few days, but is growing better. I have a thousand\r\nthings to say to you, but must defer it to other Opportunities, &\r\nconclude in Haste, with friendly Regards to your Family, very\r\naffectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Augt 12 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nThe inclosd is an attested Copy of Genl Schuylers Letter to the\r\nPresident of the Congress. It needs no Comment. How far the\r\nMassachusetts state deserves the Strictures therein made, you can\r\ntell. I send it to you for the Perusal of the Members of your\r\nHonbl House. If they have sent into the Army, Boys Negroes & Men\r\ntoo aged to be fit for any Service they will lay their Hands upon\r\ntheir Mouths. If not, I hope some decent but keen Pen will\r\nvindicate them from that & other Aspersions. This, like all his\r\nother Letters, is written in such a desponding Stile, that it is\r\nno Wonder if Soldiers decline fighting under him, though they may\r\nbe under no Apprehension of Treachery. But he has by this time\r\nreceivd his Quietus, at least till he can give a good Account of\r\nhis Conduct. Gates has gone to take the Command, and our Affairs\r\nin that Ouarter, I dare say will soon wear another Face.\r\n\r\nThe Enemies Fleet have been again seen 200 sail off Sinipunxint\r\n15 Leagues South of the Capes of Delaware. I think I have now a\r\njust Demand upon you for a Letter. I shall be disappointed if I\r\ndo not receive one by the next Post. Adieu my Friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM HEATH.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Library of Massachusetts Historical Society; the text has\r\nrecently been printed in Collections of Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety, 7th ser., vol. iv., p. 140.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Augt 13th 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe Surrender of Tyconderoga has deeply wounded our Cause. The\r\nGrounds of it must be thoroughly inquired into. The People at\r\nlarge have a Right to demand it. They do demand it and Congress\r\nhave orderd an Inquiry to be made. This Matter must be conducted\r\nwith Impartiality. The Troops orderd for the Defence of that Post\r\nwere chiefly from New England. It is said there was a great\r\nDeficiency in Numbers--and General Schuyler tells us that a third\r\nPart of the Army there were Boys Negroes and aged Men not fit for\r\nthe Field or indeed any other Service, that a great Part of them\r\nwere naked, without Blanketts, ill armed & very deficient in\r\nAccoutrements. Such is the Picture he draws. I wish to know as\r\nsoon as possible, how many Men actually marchd for that place\r\nfrom N E, & particularly from Massachusetts Bay. What Quantity of\r\nCloathing was sent for them & under whose Care; and how they were\r\nfurnishd with Arms & Accoutrements. In short I am desirous of\r\nbeing informd by you as minutely as possible, of the part taken\r\nby Muster Masters Quartermasters Cloathiers & their Agents and\r\nall other Persons employed in making and providing for the Army\r\nin the Northern Department, as far as it has properly fallen\r\nunder your Notice & Direction. Excuse me for giving you this\r\nTrouble & be assured that I am very cordially,\r\n\r\nyour Friend,\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n1Major General in the continental army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Augt 8 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI was favord with yours of the 2d of this Month by yesterdays\r\nPost. I am much obligd to you for writing to me so often, and\r\nhope you will not omit any future opportunity. [One] or another\r\nof my Boston Friends write to me by every Post, [so] that I think\r\nI should be informd if any extraordinary Accident should happen\r\nto my Family, but I am never so well satisfied as when I receive\r\none from you. I am in continual Anxiety for your Safety, but am\r\nhappy in committing you to the Protection of all gracious Heaven.\r\nMay He be your Refuge in every Time of Distress! I had before\r\nheard that the Enemies Fleet was seen off Cape Ann. We had an\r\nAccount of it [by] an Express from General Heath, who\r\ncontradicted it the [same] Day by another Express. Indeed I did\r\nnot give Credit to . . . . News for the British Ships were seen\r\noff the Maryland Shore on the first of August, the very day on\r\nwhich they were reported to have been seen off Cape Ann. Having\r\nthe Command of the Sea, they have it in their Power to give\r\nfrequent Alarms to our Seaport Towns. We have not heard of them\r\nsince, and it is the opinion of some that they are gone to South\r\nCarolina, but as it is altogether uncertain where they will go,\r\nit is prudent to be ready to receive them in every Place. It is a\r\nQuestion with me whether they have any Plan upon which they can\r\ndepend themselves. I pray God that [their] Councils may be\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hope with you, my Dear, that our . . . . Life is not\r\nalways to live at this Distance from each [other] but that we\r\nshall see the happy Day when Tyranny [shall] be subdued and the\r\nLiberty of our Country shall be settled upon a permanent\r\nFoundation. If this is not to be accomplishd in our Day, May we\r\nhereafter meet our virtuous Friends in that blessd Region, where\r\nthe wicked shall cease from troubling.\r\n\r\nMy Love to my dear Daughter, Sister Polly & the rest of my Family\r\n& Friends. Tell my Servants I thank them for their kind\r\nRemembrance of me. I am, my dear,\r\n\r\never yours,\r\n\r\nI have sent the Letter to\r\nCapt M. inclosd in one\r\nto Dr F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY BROMFIELD.\r\n\r\n[Publications of Colonial Society of Massachusetts, vol. vi., pp.\r\n78, 79.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Sept 2, 1777.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI am requested by a Member of Congress from South Carolina for\r\nwhom I have a particular Regard, to introduce his Friend Mr Henry\r\nCrouch to some of my Boston Friends. He is a Merchant of\r\nCharlestown and will set off on a Visit your Way tomorrow. I take\r\nthe Liberty of addressing a Letter to you by him. Your friendly\r\nNotice of him will greatly oblige me.\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate you on the happy Change of our Affairs at\r\nthe Northward. The Feelings of a Man of Burgoyne's Vanity must be\r\nsorely touched by this Disappointment.\r\n\r\nHowe's Army remains near where they first landed and is supposed\r\nto be ten thousand fit for Duty. Washington's Army exceeds that\r\nNumber, is in health & high Spirits, and the Militia have joynd\r\nin great Numbers, well equip'd and ambitious to emulate the Valor\r\nof their Eastern Brethren. Our light Troops are continually\r\nharrassing the Enemy. The Day before yesterday they attack'd\r\ntheir out Posts & drove them in, killing & wounding a small\r\nNumber. By the last Account we had taken about seventy Prisoners\r\nwithout any Loss on our side. Our Affairs are at this Moment very\r\nserious and critical. We are contending for the Rights of our\r\nCountry and Mankind--May the Confidence of America be placed in\r\nthe God of Armies! Please to pay my due Respects to my old Friend\r\nMr Phillips & his Family and be assured that I am very cordially\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Sept 17, 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYour kind Letter of the 29th of August is now before me. You\r\ntherein take a very proper Notice of the signal Success of our\r\nAffairs at the Northward. I hope my Countrymen are duly sensible\r\nof the obligation they are under to Him from whose Hand, as you\r\njustly observe, our Victory came. We had a Letter from General\r\nGates yesterday, from which we every hour expect another great\r\nEvent from that Quarter. The two Armies this way had an obstinate\r\nEngagement last Thursday. The Enemy have gaind a Patch of Ground\r\nbut from all Accounts they have purchasd it as dearly as Bunkers\r\nHill. Two or three more such Victories would totally ruin their\r\nArmy. Matters seem to be drawing to a Crisis. The Enemy have had\r\nenough to do to dress their wounded and bury their dead. Howe\r\nstill remains near the Field of Battle. Genl Washington retreated\r\nwith his Army over the River Schuilkill through this city as far\r\nas . . . . and we are every day expecting another battle. May\r\nHeaven favor our righteous Cause and grant us compleat Victory.\r\nBoth the Armies are about 26 miles from this City.\r\n\r\nI am pleasd to hear that Colo Crafts invited Mr Thacher to preach\r\na Sermon to his Regiment. He discoverd the true Spirit of a New\r\nEngland officer. I dare say it was an animating Discourse.\r\nReligion has been & I hope will continue to be the ornament of N.\r\nEngland. While they place their Confidence in God they will not\r\nfail to be an happy People.\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly rejoycd to hear that Miss Hatch is in hopes of\r\nrecovering her Health.\r\n\r\nRemember me, my dear, to my Family and Friends. I am in good\r\nHealth & Spirits and remain with the warmest Affection\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H.

And although I have not hitherto acknowledged to you\r\nthe receipt of them, I assure you I have been and am still\r\nimproving the intelligence you have given me to the best of my\r\npowers, for the advantage of this country. From our former\r\ncorrespondence you have known my sentiments. I have not altered\r\nthem in a single point, either with regard to the great cause we\r\nare engaged in, or to you, who have been an early, vigilant, and\r\nactive supporter of it. While you Honour me with your\r\nconfidential letters, I feel and will freely express to you my\r\nobligation. To have answered them severally, would have led me to\r\nsubjects of great delicacy; and the miscarriage of my letters\r\nmight have proved detrimental to our important affairs. It was\r\nneedless for me to run the risk for the sake of writing; for I\r\npresume you have been made fully acquainted with the state of our\r\npublic affairs by the committee. And as I have constantly\r\ncommunicated to your brother R. H. the contents of your letters\r\nto me, it was sufficient on that score for him only to write, FOR\r\nHE THINKS AS I DO.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Fayette, who does me the honour to take this\r\nletter, is this moment going; which leaves me time only to add,\r\nthat I am and will be your friend, because I know you love our\r\ncountry and mankind.\r\n\r\nI beg you to write to me by every opportunity. Adieu, my dear\r\nsir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORATIO GATES.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\n[ 1777]\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI have had the Honor of laying before the Council Board of this\r\nState your Letter of the 19th of October, inclosing Copy of a\r\nConvention by which the British Lt Genl Burgoyne surrendered\r\nhimself & his whole Army on the 17 of the same Month into your\r\nHands. The repeated Instances of the Success of the American Army\r\nin the Northern Department reflect the highest Honor on yourself\r\n& the gallant officers & Soldiers under YOUR Command. The Board\r\ncongratulate you on this great Occasion; and while the Merit of\r\nyour signal Services remains recorded in the faithful Breasts of\r\nyour Countrymen, the warmest Gratitude is due to the God of\r\nArmies, who has vouchsafed in so distinguished a Manner to favor\r\nthe Cause of America & of Mankind.\r\n\r\nI have the Honor to be\r\nin the Name of the Council Board,\r\nSir &c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n[NOVEMBER 1, 1777.]\r\n\r\n[MS., Papers of the Continental Congress.

To inspire our Commanders both by Land and\r\nSea, & all under them with that Wisdom and Fortitude which may\r\nrender them fit Instruments, under the Providence of Almighty\r\nGod, to secure for these United States, the greatest of all human\r\nBlessings, INDEPENDENCE and PEACE. That it may please Him, to\r\nprosper the Trade and Manufactures of the People, and the Labor\r\nof the Husbandman, that our Land may yet yield its Increase. To\r\ntake Schools and Seminaries of Education, so necessary for\r\ncultivating the Principles of true Liberty, Virtue, & Piety,\r\nunder His nurturing Hand; and to prosper the Means of Religion\r\nfor the Promotion and Enlargement of that Kingdom which\r\nconsisteth \"in RIGHTEOUSNESS PEACE AND JOY IN THE HOLY GHOST.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is further recommended, that servile Labor, and such\r\nRecreation as, though at other times innocent, may be unbecoming\r\nthe Purpose of this Appointment, may be omitted on so solemn an\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[TO JOHN ADAMS.]\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr 8 1777\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI heartily thank you for your two favors of the 12th & 18th of\r\nNovemr, the former of which gave me a piece of Intelligence which\r\nI thought proper to give the Publick through the News paper.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for me, on my Arrival here, I found the General\r\nAssembly sitting, and consequently I am plungd in publick\r\nBusiness sooner than I could wish to have been. Among other\r\nthings I have the Satisfaction of informing you of your\r\nReelection as a Member of Congress. Your old Colleagues are all\r\nagain chosen. I honestly told some of our Countrymen that I\r\nthought it incumbent on them thorowly to acquaint themselves with\r\nthe Character and Conduct of those who represent them at the\r\nDistance of four hundred Miles; but I fear they are too\r\nunsuspecting. What do frequent Elections avail, without that\r\nSpirit of Jealousy & Strict Inquiry which alone can render such\r\nElections any Security to the People? But surely the more\r\nimplicit the Confidence of the Publick is, the more circumspect\r\nought those to be, who are entrusted with publick Affairs.\r\n\r\nMr------ came to this Town with great Pomp, and was receivd by\r\nthe military and naval Gentlemen, as I am informd, with equal\r\nCeremony. His Colleagues arrivd in the Dusk of the Evening and\r\nwithout Observation. He is the most happy who has the greatest\r\nShare of the Affections of his Fellow Citizens, without which,\r\nthe Ears of a sincere Patriot are ever deaf to the ROARING OF\r\nCANNON AND THE CHARMS OF MUSICK. I have not seen nor heard of any\r\nDangers on the Road that should require Guards to protect one. It\r\nis pretty enough in the Eyes of some Men, to see the honest\r\nCountry Folks gapeing & staring at a Troop of Light Horse. But it\r\nis well if it is not some times attended with such Effects as one\r\nwould not so much wish for, to excite the Contempt of the\r\nMultitude, when the Fit of gazing is over, instead of the much\r\nlongd for Hosannas.\r\n\r\nI have not been long enough in Town to be able to give you a full\r\nAccount of the Affairs of this State. The Assembly are\r\ninterresting themselves as much as possible for the Supply of our\r\nArmy--a small parcel of Cloathing is ready to be sent, which is\r\nintended for the Troops of this State. It is proposd that they\r\nshall purchase them at the first Cost and Charges, but not yet\r\ndetermined. The late Commissary General Colo Trumbull came to\r\nTown a few days ago. I have not yet seen him. Your Affairs in\r\nthat Department suffer for want of a Commissary of Issues in the\r\nEastern District to receive the provisions in Colo Trumbull's\r\nHands. The two Houses have requested him to deliver to Mr Colt\r\nwho is also here, 12000 bushells of Salt belonging to the\r\nContinent in this State, and have authorizd a good Man to furnish\r\nhim with Waggons, & to impress them if they cannot be otherwise\r\nprocured. I fear if the Commissaries Department is not soon\r\nalterd, a dangerous Convulsion will take place. Pray attend to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of waiting on your Lady yesterday. She & her\r\nlittle Flock, or as I might better express it, her great Flock of\r\nlittle Folks are in good Health, as I suppose she will inform you\r\nin a Letter which I hope to inclose in this.\r\n\r\nBe so kind as to pay my warm Respects to Mr Gerry and Dana\r\nGeneral Roberdeau the two Colo Lees and many others, not\r\nforgetting the Connecticutt Gentlemen and all who may enquire\r\nafter me. Among these I flatter myself I shall not be forgotten\r\nby the worthy Ladies in the Generals Family. Pray make my very\r\nrespectful Compliments together with those of my Spouse to them,\r\nand assure them that I have a most grateful Remembrance of the\r\nmany Civilities I receivd from them. May Heaven bless them and\r\nthe little Folks under their Charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS TO HENRY LAURENS.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Massachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MASS. BAY COUNCIL CHAMBER Decr 1777\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI have the Honor to acquaint you that your Letter of the 28th of\r\nNovr inclosing Articles of Confederation and diverse Resolutions\r\nof Congress have been laid before the General Assembly of this\r\nState. But the Assembly having previously requested the Council\r\nto order an Adjournment, and many of the Members having returnd\r\nto their respective Homes, the Council have adjournd the Assembly\r\nto a short Day when it is expected there will be a full Meeting;\r\nand the important matters above mentiond will be taken under due\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI am in the Name of the Council--\r\nSir\r\nyour most hbl servt\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME III.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n1President of the Continental Congress.",
