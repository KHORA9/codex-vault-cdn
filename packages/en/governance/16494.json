FITZPATRICK\r\nAUTHOR OF 'THE OUTSPAN'\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nWILLIAM HEINEMANN\r\n1899\r\n\r\n\r\n_Written August, 1896.\r\nPrivately circulated June, 1899.\r\nSupplemented and published September 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was originally designed to compile a statement of the\r\noccurrences of 1895-6 in the Transvaal and of the conditions\r\nwhich led up to them, in the hope of removing the very grave\r\nmisunderstandings which existed. Everybody else had been heard and\r\njudged, the Uitlander had only been judged. It therefore seemed\r\nproper that somebody should attempt to present the case for the\r\nUitlander. The writer, as a South African by birth, as a resident\r\nin the Transvaal since 1884, and lastly as Secretary of the Reform\r\nCommittee, felt impelled to do this, but suffered under the\r\ndisability of President Kruger's three years' ban; and although it\r\nmight possibly have been urged that a plain statement of facts and\r\nexplanations of past actions could not be fairly regarded as a\r\ndeliberate interference in politics, the facts themselves when set\r\nout appeared to constitute an indictment so strong as to make it\r\nworth while considering whether the Government of the Transvaal would\r\nnot regard it as sufficient excuse to put in force the sentence of\r\nbanishment. The postponement of publication which was then decided\r\nupon for a period of three years appeared to be tantamount to the\r\nabandonment of the original purpose, and the work was continued with\r\nthe intention of making it a private record to be printed at the\r\nexpiry of the term of silence, and to be privately circulated among\r\nthose who were personally concerned or interested; a record which\r\nmight perhaps be of service some day in filling in a page of South\r\nAfrican history.\r\n\r\nThe private circulation of that work during June of the present\r\nyear led to suggestions from many quarters that it should be\r\nsupplemented by a chapter or two dealing with later events and\r\npublished; and the present volume is the outcome of these\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nIt is realized that much of what might properly appear in a private\r\nrecord will be considered rather superfluous in a book designed for\r\nwider circulation. For instance, a good deal of space is given to\r\ndetails of the trial and the prison life of the Reformers, which are\r\nof no interest whatever to the public, although they form a record\r\nwhich the men themselves may like to preserve. These might have been\r\nomitted but that the writer desired to make no alterations in the\r\noriginal text except in the nature of literary revision.\r\n\r\nThe writer may be charged by the \"peace\" party with deliberately\r\nselecting a critical and anxious time as opportune to contribute a\r\nnew factor to those already militating against a peaceful settlement.\r\nTwo replies could be made to this: one an excuse and one an answer.\r\nIt would be an excuse that the writer did not deliberately select\r\nthe time of publication, but that the Transvaal Government in its\r\nwisdom chose to impose silence for three years, and that the project\r\nwith which their action had interfered was resumed at the earliest\r\npossible moment. The coincidence of another crisis with the date of\r\nemancipation may be an unlucky coincidence, or it may be a result.\r\nBut there is neither necessity nor intention to offer excuses. The\r\nresponsibility is accepted and the answer is that a case so sound\r\nneeds only to be understood, that a recital of the facts must help\r\nto dispel the mists of race prejudice and misunderstanding which are\r\nobscuring the judgment of many; and that a firm but strictly just\r\nand dignified handling of the question by the Imperial Government\r\nis the only possible way to avert a catastrophe in South Africa. It\r\nis essential therefore that first of all the conditions as they are\r\nshould be understood; and this record is offered as a contribution\r\nto that end. Let the measure of its truth be the measure of its\r\nusefulness!\r\n\r\nThe reader is not invited to believe that the case is presented in\r\nsuch form as it might have been presented by an impartial historian.\r\nIt is the Transvaal _from within_, by one who feels all the\r\ninjustice and indignity of the position. With the knowledge, however,\r\nthat a good case is spoiled by overstatement and with the desire to\r\navoid injustice to others an earnest attempt has been made to state\r\nthe facts fairly. In how far that attempt has been successful the\r\nreader must decide for himself.\r\n\r\nJ.P.F.\r\n  _July, 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to avoid in this volume more or less pointed\r\nreference to certain nationalities in certain connections; for\r\ninstance such expressions as \"the Boers,\" \"the Cape Dutch,\" \"the\r\nHollanders,\" \"the Germans,\" are used. The writer desires to say once\r\nand for all that unless the contrary is obviously and deliberately\r\nindicated, the distinctions between nationalities are intended in the\r\npolitical sense only and not in the racial sense, and if by mischance\r\nthere should be found something in these pages which seems offensive,\r\nhe begs the more indulgent interpretation on the ground of a very\r\nearnest desire to remove and not to accentuate race distinctions.\r\n\r\nGeneral references are also made to classes--\"the civil service,\"\r\n\"the officials,\" &c. There are officials in the Transvaal service\r\nwho would earn the confidence and esteem of the public in any\r\nadministration in the world. It is hardly necessary to say that there\r\nis no intention to disparage them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n  CHAPTER I.

Yes, they'll get\r\nthem--over my dead body!' And volumes of explanation could not better\r\nillustrate the Boer attitude and policy towards the English-speaking\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\n'L'État c'est moi' is almost as true of the old Dopper President as\r\nit was of its originator; for in matters of external policy and in\r\nmatters which concern the Boer as a party the President has his way\r\nas surely and as completely as any anointed autocrat. To anyone who\r\nhas studied the Boers and their ways and policy--who has given more\r\nthan passing consideration to the incidents and negotiations of the\r\npresent year{01}--it must be clear that President Kruger does\r\nsomething more than represent the opinion of the people and execute\r\ntheir policy: he moulds them in the form he wills. By the force of\r\nhis own strong convictions and prejudices, and of his indomitable\r\nwill, he has made the Boers a people whom he regards as the germ of\r\nthe Africander nation; a people chastened, selected, welded, and\r\nstrong enough to attract and assimilate all their kindred in South\r\nAfrica, and then to realize the dream of a Dutch Republic from the\r\nZambesi to Capetown.\r\n\r\nIn the history of South Africa the figure of the grim old President\r\nwill loom large and striking--picturesque, as the figure of one who\r\nby his character and will made and held his people; magnificent, as\r\none who in the face of the blackest fortune never wavered from his\r\naim or faltered in his effort; who, with a courage that seemed, and\r\nstill seems, fatuous, but which may well be called heroic, stood up\r\nagainst the might of the greatest empire in the world. And, it may\r\nbe, pathetic, too, as one whose limitations were great, one whose\r\ntraining and associations--whose very successes--had narrowed, and\r\nembittered and hardened him; as one who, when the greatness of\r\nsuccess was his to take and to hold, turned his back on the supreme\r\nopportunity, and used his strength and qualities to fight against the\r\nspirit of progress, and all that the enlightenment of the age\r\npronounces to be fitting and necessary to good government and a\r\nhealthy State.\r\n\r\nTo an English nobleman, who, in the course of an interview, remarked,\r\n'My father was a Minister of England, and twice Viceroy of Ireland,'\r\nthe old Dutchman answered, 'And my father was a shepherd!' It was not\r\npride rebuking pride; it was the ever-present fact which would not\r\nhave been worth mentioning but for the suggestion of the antithesis.\r\nHe too was a shepherd, and is--a peasant. It may be that he knows\r\nwhat would be right and good for his people, and it may be not; but\r\nit is sure that he realizes that to educate would be to emancipate,\r\nto broaden their views would be to break down the defences of their\r\nprejudices, to let in the new leaven would be to spoil the old bread,\r\nto give unto all men the rights of men would be to swamp for ever the\r\nparty which is to him greater than the State. When one thinks on the\r\none-century history of the people, much is seen that accounts for\r\ntheir extraordinary love of isolation, and their ingrained and\r\npassionate aversion to control; much too that draws to them a world\r\nof sympathy. And when one realizes the old Dopper President hemmed in\r\nonce more by the hurrying tide of civilization, from which his people\r\nhave fled for generations--trying to fight both fate and\r\nNature--standing up to stem a tide as resistless as the eternal\r\nsea--one sees the pathos of the picture. But this is as another\r\ngeneration may see it.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are too close--so close that the meaner details, the\r\ninsincerity, the injustice, the barbarity--all the unlovely touches\r\nthat will by-and-by be forgotten--sponged away by the gentle hand of\r\ntime, when only the picturesque will remain.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the deep, ineradicable aversion to English\r\nrule which is in the heart and the blood and the bones of every Boer,\r\nand of a great many of their kindred who are themselves British\r\nsubjects, one must recall the conditions under which the Dutch came\r\nunder British rule. When, in 1814, the Cape was finally ceded to\r\nEngland, it had been twice acquired and held by conquest. The\r\ncolonists were practically all Dutch, or Huguenots who had adopted\r\nDutch as their language, and South Africa as their home. In any case\r\nthey were people who, by tradition, teaching and experience, must\r\nhave regarded the English as their enemies; people in whom there must\r\nhave been roused bitter resentment against being handed over with the\r\nland to their traditional enemies. Were they serfs or subjects? has\r\nbeen asked on their behalf. Had Holland the right, the power, over\r\nfreemen born, to say to them, 'You are our subjects, on our soil, and\r\nwe have transferred the soil and with it your allegiance to England,\r\nwhose sovereignty you will not be free to repudiate.' The Dutch\r\ncolonist said 'No.' The English Government and the laws of the day\r\nsaid 'Yes.'\r\n\r\nEarly in the century the Boers began to trek away from the sphere of\r\nBritish rule. They were trekkers before that, indeed. Even in the\r\ndays of Van Riebeck (1650) they had trekked away from the crowded\r\nparts, and opened up with the rifle and the plough new reaches of\r\ncountry; pioneering in a rough but most effective way, driving back\r\nthe savage races, and clearing the way for civilization. There is,\r\nhowever, a great difference to be noted between the early treks of\r\nthe emigrants and the treks 'from British rule.' In the former (with\r\nfew exceptions) they went, knowing that their Government would follow\r\nthem, and even anxious to have its support and its representatives;\r\nand the people who formed their migrating parties were those who had\r\nno or insufficient land in the settled parts, those who were starting\r\nlife on their own account, or those whose families could not be\r\nlocated and provided for in the cramped circumstances of the more\r\noccupied parts. In the other case, rich and poor, old and young,\r\nwent off as in the days and in the fashion of Moses or Abraham. They\r\nwent without leave or help of the Government; secretly or openly\r\nthey went, and they asked nothing but to be left alone. They left\r\ntheir homes, their people, the protection of an established\r\nGovernment and a rough civilization, and went out into the unknown.\r\nAnd they had, as it appeared to them, and as it will appear to many\r\nothers, good reasons for taking so grave a step. For, although the\r\ncolonists of South Africa enjoyed better government, and infinitely\r\nmore liberty, under British rule, than they had under the tyrannical\r\n_régime_ of the Dutch East India Company twenty years before\r\n(against which the Boers had twice risen in rebellion) there were\r\nmany things which were not as they should have been. A generation\r\nhad grown up which knew nothing of the arbitrary and oppressive rule\r\nof the old Dutch Company. Simple folks have long memories, and all\r\nthe world over injuries make a deeper and more lasting impression\r\nthan benefits; and the older generation of Boers, which could recall\r\na condition of things contrasting unpleasantly with British rule,\r\nalso remembered the executions of Slagters Nek--a vindication of the\r\nlaw which, when all allowance has been made for disturbed times, and\r\nthe need of strong measures to stop rebellion in a newly-acquired\r\ncountry, seems to us to-day to have been harsh, unnecessary, and\r\nunwise in policy, and truly terrible in the manner of fulfilment.\r\n\r\nThe Boers have produced from their own ranks no literary champion to\r\nplead or defend their cause, and their earlier history is therefore\r\nlittle known, and often misunderstood; but to their aid has come Mr.\r\nGeorge McCall Theal, the South African historian, whose years of\r\nlaborious research have rescued for South Africa much that would\r\notherwise have been lost. In his 'History of the Boers' Mr. Theal\r\nrecords the causes of the great emigration, and shows how the Boers\r\nstood up for fair treatment, and fought the cause, not of Boers\r\nalone, but of all colonists. Boers and British were alike harshly and\r\nignorantly treated by high-handed Governors, and an ill-informed and\r\nprejudiced Colonial Office, who made no distinction on the grounds\r\nof nationality between the two; for we read that Englishmen had been\r\nexpelled the country, thrown in gaol, had their property\r\nconfiscated, and their newspapers suppressed for asserting their\r\nindependence, and for trifling breaches of harsh laws. The following\r\nextract gives the best possible synopsis of the causes, and should\r\nwhet an appetite which can be gratified by the purchase of Mr.\r\nTheal's book:\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did these men abandon their homes, sacrifice whatever\r\nproperty could not be carried away, and flee from English rule as\r\nfrom the most hateful tyranny? The causes are stated in a great mass\r\nof correspondence addressed by them to the Colonial Government, and\r\nnow preserved, with other colonial records, in declarations published\r\nby some of them before leaving, in letters to their relatives and to\r\nnewspapers, and in hundreds of pages of printed matter, prepared by\r\nfriendly and hostile hands. The declaration of one of the ablest men\r\namong them assigns the following as the motives of himself and the\r\nparty that went with him:\r\n\r\n  'GRAHAM'S TOWN,\r\n  '_January 22, 1837_\r\n\r\n'1. We despair of saving the colony from those evils which threaten\r\nit by the turbulent and dishonest conduct of vagrants who are allowed\r\nto infest the country in every part; nor do we see any prospect of\r\npeace or happiness for our children in a country thus distracted by\r\ninternal commotions.\r\n\r\n'2. We complain of the severe losses which we have been forced to\r\nsustain by the emancipation of our slaves, and the vexatious laws\r\nwhich have been enacted respecting them.\r\n\r\n'3. We complain of the continual system of plunder which we have for\r\nyears endured from the Kaffirs and other coloured classes, and\r\nparticularly by the last invasion of the colony, which has desolated\r\nthe frontier districts, and ruined most of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n'4. We complain of the unjustifiable odium which has been cast upon\r\nus by interested and dishonest persons, under the name of religion,\r\nwhose testimony is believed in England, to the exclusion of all\r\nevidence in our favour; and we can foresee, as the result of this\r\nprejudice, nothing but the total ruin of the country.\r\n\r\n'5. We are resolved, wherever we go, that we will uphold the just\r\nprinciples of liberty; but, whilst we will take care that no one is\r\nbrought by us into a condition of slavery, we will establish such\r\nregulations as may suppress crime, and preserve proper relations\r\nbetween master and servant.\r\n\r\n'6. We solemnly declare that we leave this colony with a desire to\r\nenjoy a quieter life than we have hitherto had. We will not molest\r\nany people, nor deprive them of the smallest property; but, if\r\nattacked, we shall consider ourselves fully justified in defending\r\nour persons and effects, to the utmost of our ability, against every\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n'7. We make known that when we shall have framed a code of laws for\r\nour guidance, copies shall be forwarded to this colony for general\r\ninformation; but we take the opportunity of stating that it is our\r\nfirm resolve to make provision for the summary punishment, even with\r\ndeath, of all traitors, without exception, who may be found amongst\r\nus.\r\n\r\n'8. We purpose, in the course of our journey, and on arrival at the\r\ncountry in which we shall permanently reside, to make known to the\r\nnative tribes our intentions, and our desire to live in peace and\r\nfriendly intercourse with them.\r\n\r\n'9. We quit this colony under the full assurance that the English\r\nGovernment has nothing more to require of us, and will allow us to\r\ngovern ourselves without its interference in future.\r\n\r\n'10. We are now leaving the fruitful land of our birth, in which we\r\nhave suffered enormous losses and continual vexation, and are about\r\nto enter a strange and dangerous territory; but we go with a firm\r\nreliance on an all-seeing, just, and merciful God, whom we shall\r\nalways fear, and humbly endeavour to obey.\r\n\r\n'In the name of all who leave the colony with me,\r\n\r\n  'P. RETIEF.'\r\n\r\nBut formal declarations such as the above are not in all instances to\r\nbe trusted. It is much safer to compare numerous documents written at\r\ndifferent times, by different persons, and under different\r\ncircumstances. For our subject this means of information is as\r\ncomplete as can be desired. The correspondence of the emigrants with\r\nthe Cape Government was the work of many individuals, and extended\r\nover many years. The letters are usually of great length, badly\r\nconstructed, and badly spelt--the productions, in short, of\r\nuneducated men; but so uniform is the vein of thought running through\r\nthem all, that there is not the slightest difficulty in condensing\r\nthem into a dozen pages. When analyzed, the statements contained in\r\nthem are found to consist of two charges, one against the Imperial\r\nGovernment, the other against the agents in South Africa of the\r\nLondon Missionary Society.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government was charged with exposing the white\r\ninhabitants of the colony, without protection, to robbery and murder\r\nby the blacks; with giving credence in every dispute to statements\r\nmade by interested persons in favour of savages, while refusing to\r\ncredit the testimony, no matter how reliable, of colonists of\r\nEuropean extraction; with liberating the slaves in an unjust manner;\r\nand generally with such undue partiality for persons with black skins\r\nand savage habits, as to make it preferable to seek a new home in the\r\nwilderness than remain under the English flag.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries of the London Society were charged with usurping\r\nauthority that should properly belong to the civil magistrate; with\r\nmisrepresenting facts; and with advocating schemes directly hostile\r\nto the progress of civilization, and to the observance of order. And\r\nit was asserted that the influence of these missionaries was all\r\npowerful at the Colonial Office in London, by which the colony,\r\nwithout a voice in the management of its affairs, was then ruled\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nIn support of the charges against the Imperial Government, the\r\nemigrants dwelt largely upon the devastation of the eastern districts\r\nby the Kaffirs' inroad of December, 1834, which was certainly\r\nunprovoked by the colonists. Yet Lord Glenelg, who was then Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies, justified the Kaffirs, and not only\r\nrefused to punish them, but actually gave them a large slip of land,\r\nincluding the dense jungles along the Fish River, that had long\r\nbeen part of the colony; and made no other provision against the\r\nrecurrence of a destructive invasion than a series of treaties with a\r\nnumber of barbarous chiefs, who had no regard for their engagements.\r\nThis event is the most prominent feature in the correspondence of\r\nthe emigrants; it is fairly recorded, and the language used is in\r\ngeneral much more moderate than that employed by the English\r\nfrontier colonists when relating the same circumstance.\r\n\r\nNext stands the removal of all restraint from the coloured population\r\nof the colony, without the protection to the whites of even a Vagrant\r\nAct. Several of the colonial divisions had been for ten or twelve\r\nyears overrun by fugitives from the Basuto and Betshuana countries,\r\nwho had been driven from their own homes by the troubles already\r\nrecorded. These people were usually termed Mantatees or Makatees,\r\nfrom the supposition that they were all subjects of Ma Ntatisi.\r\nTowards the eastern frontiers Kaffirs, and after the war Fingos,\r\nwandered about practically wherever they chose. In the remainder of\r\nthe colony Hottentots, free blacks, and mixed breeds came and went as\r\nthey pleased. How is it possible, said the farmers, for us to\r\ncultivate the ground, or breed cattle, with all these savages and\r\nsemi-savages constantly watching for opportunities to plunder\r\nus--with no police, and no law under which suspicious characters can\r\nbe arrested and made to account for their manner of living?\r\n\r\nMuch is said of the reproofs of Sir Benjamin D'Urban by the Secretary\r\nof State, and, after 1838, of the dismissal of that Governor, (1) The\r\nemigrants asserted that he was the best Governor the colony had had\r\nsince it became subject to England; they dwelt upon his benevolence,\r\nhis ability, his strict justice, his impartiality to white and black,\r\nhis efforts to promote civilization; and then they complained, in\r\nwords more bitter than are to be found when they referred to any\r\nother subject, that the good Governor had been reproved, and finally\r\ndeprived of his office, because he had told the plain truth,\r\nregardless of the London Missionary Society; and had endeavoured to\r\nmete out to black criminals the same justice that he would have meted\r\nout had they been white. There is now no one in South Africa who does\r\nnot agree with the emigrants in this matter. Nearly half a century\r\nhas passed away since Sir Benjamin D'Urban was forced into retirement\r\nby Lord Glenelg; and during that period the principal measures which\r\nhe proposed have been approved of and adopted, while the successors\r\nof those missionaries who were his bitter opponents are at present\r\namong the strongest advocates of his system of dealing with the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin D'Urban remained in South Africa, after being deprived\r\nof office, until the reversal of his policy towards the natives was\r\nadmitted by most people even in England to have been a mistake. He\r\ndid not leave the Cape until April, 1846, just after the commencement\r\nof the War of the Axe.\r\n\r\nConcerning the liberation of the slaves, there is less in this\r\ncorrespondence than one might reasonably expect to find. Many scores\r\nof pages can be examined without any allusion whatever to it. Nowhere\r\nis there a single word to be found in favour of slavery as an\r\ninstitution; the view of the emigrants, with hardly an exception,\r\nbeing fairly represented in the following sentence, taken from a\r\nletter of the Volksraad at Natal to Sir George Napier: 'A long and\r\nsad experience has sufficiently convinced us of the injury, loss, and\r\ndearness of slave labour, so that neither slavery nor the slave trade\r\nwill ever be permitted among us.'\r\n\r\n[The allusions to the emancipation of slaves, and to slavery as an\r\ninstitution, will be considered by many to need some modification or\r\nexplanation. The Dutch even to-day speak of the emancipation as the\r\nreal cause of the great exodus; and the system of indenture, and\r\nthe treatment of natives generally by the Boers, cannot fairly be\r\nregarded as warranting the view expressed by Mr. Theal in connection\r\nwith this letter to Sir George Napier.]\r\n\r\nIt is alleged, however, that the emancipation, as it was carried out,\r\nwas an act of confiscation. It is stated that most of the slaves were\r\nbrought to the colony in English ships, and sold by English subjects;\r\nthat when, in 1795, the colony was invited by English officers of\r\nhigh rank to place itself under the protection of England, one of the\r\ninducements held out was security in slave property; at the same time\r\nthose officers warning the colonists that if France obtained\r\npossession she would liberate the slaves, as she had done in\r\nMartinique, thereby ruining this colony as she had ruined that\r\nisland; that the English Government had recently and suddenly changed\r\nits policy, and required them to conform to the change with equal\r\nalacrity, whereas they were convinced that gradual emancipation, with\r\nsecurities against vagrancy, was the only safe course. The\r\nemancipation had been sudden, and the slaves had been placed upon a\r\nperfect political equality with their former proprietors. The\r\nmissionaries applauded this as a noble and generous act of the\r\nImperial Government, and they were told that by everyone in England\r\nit was so regarded. But at whose expense was this noble and generous\r\nact carried out? Agents of the Imperial Government had appraised the\r\nslaves, generally at less than their market value. Two-fifths of this\r\nappraisement, being the share apportioned to the Cape out of the\r\ntwenty million pounds sterling voted by the Imperial Parliament, had\r\nthen been offered to the proprietors as compensation, if they chose\r\nto go to London for it, otherwise they could only dispose of their\r\nclaims at a heavy discount. Thus, in point of fact, only about\r\none-third of the appraised amount had been received. To all\r\nslave-holders this had meant a great reduction of wealth, while to\r\nmany of those who were in debt it was equivalent to the utter\r\ndeprivation of all property.\r\n\r\nAs regards the missionaries, a crusade was organized by some of these\r\nworthies, who had themselves married Kaffir women, and who spared no\r\neffort and showed no scruple in blackening the name of colonist.\r\n\r\nThe views and interests of the colonists and of these men were so\r\ndifferent that concord was hardly possible. The missionaries desired\r\nthat the blacks should be collected together in villages: the\r\ncolonists were unwilling that they should be thus withdrawn from\r\nservice. 'Teach them the first step in civilization, to labour\r\nhonestly for their maintenance, and add to that oral instruction in\r\nthe doctrines of Christianity,' said the colonists. 'Why should they\r\nbe debarred from learning to read and write? And as there can only be\r\nschools if they are brought together in villages, why should they not\r\nbe collected together?' replied the missionaries.\r\n\r\nThen came another and a larger question. By whom should the waste\r\nplaces of the land, the vast areas which were without other occupants\r\nthan a few roving Bushmen, be peopled? 'By the white man,' said the\r\ncolonists; 'it is to the advantage of the world in all time to come\r\nthat the higher race should expand and be dominant here; it would be\r\ntreason to humanity to prevent its growth where it can grow without\r\nwrong to others, or to plant an inferior stock where the superior can\r\ntake root and flourish.' 'By Africans,' said the missionaries; 'this\r\nis African soil; and if mission stations are established on its\r\ndesolate tracts, people will be drawn to them from the far interior,\r\nthe community will grow rapidly, those enlightened by Christianity\r\nhere will desire in their turn to enlighten their friends beyond, and\r\nthus the Gospel teaching will spread until all Africa stretches out\r\nits hands to God.' Coupled with such arguments, which were constantly\r\nused by missionaries in the early part of this century, before their\r\nenthusiasm was cooled by experience, were calculations that appealed\r\nstrongly to the commercial instincts of people in England. A dozen\r\ncolonial farmers required something like a hundred square miles of\r\nland for their cattle runs; on this same ground, under missionary\r\nsupervision, three or four hundred families of blacks could exist;\r\nthese blacks would shortly need large quantities of manufactured\r\ngoods; and thus it would be to the interest of trade to encourage\r\nthem rather than the colonists. 'Already,' said they, 'after only a\r\nfew years' training, many blacks can read as well or better than the\r\nordinary colonists, and are exhibiting a decided taste for\r\ncivilization.'\r\n\r\nThere was thus a broad line of demarcation between the colonists and\r\nsuch of the missionaries as held these views, and the tendency on\r\neach side was to make it still broader. It was deepened into positive\r\nantipathy towards those missionaries who, following Dr. Vanderkemp's\r\nexample, united themselves in marriage with black women, and\r\nproclaimed themselves the champions of the black population against\r\nthe white. Everyone acquainted with South African natives knows how\r\nready they are to please their friends by bringing forward charges\r\nagainst anyone whom those friends dislike. Unfortunately the\r\nmissionaries Vanderkemp and Read were deceived into believing a great\r\nnumber of charges of cruelty made against various colonists, which a\r\nlittle observation would have shown in most instances to be\r\ngroundless; and thereupon they lodged accusations before the High\r\nCourt of Justice. In 1811 between seventy and eighty such cases came\r\nbefore the Circuit Court for trial. There was hardly a family on the\r\nfrontier of which some relative was not brought as a criminal before\r\nthe judges to answer to a charge of murder or violent assault.\r\nSeveral months were occupied in the trials, and more than a thousand\r\nwitnesses were examined, but in every instance the most serious\r\ncharges were proved to be without foundation. Only a few convictions,\r\nand those of no very outrageous crimes, resulted from these\r\nprosecutions, which kept the entire colony in a ferment until long\r\nafter the circuit was closed.\r\n\r\nThus far everyone will approve of the sentiments of one party or the\r\nother according to his sympathy, but in what follows no unprejudiced\r\nperson who will take the trouble to study the matter thoroughly can\r\nacquit the anti-colonial missionaries of something more faulty than\r\nmere error of judgment. For years their writings teemed with charges\r\nagainst the colonists similar to those they had brought before the\r\nHigh Court of Justice. These writings were circulated widely in\r\nEurope, where the voice of the colonists was never heard, and they\r\ncreated impressions there which no refutation made in South Africa\r\ncould ever counteract. The acts, the language, even the written\r\npetitions of the colonists, were so distorted in accounts sent home,\r\nthat these accounts cannot now be read by those who have made\r\nthemselves acquainted with the truth, without the liveliest feelings\r\nof indignation being excited.\r\n\r\nThe colonists learned that in England they were regarded as cruel\r\nbarbarians because they refused to permit Hottentot herds, swarming\r\nwith vermin, to be seated in their front rooms at the time of family\r\nprayer. They found themselves pictured as the harshest of\r\ntaskmasters, as unfeeling violators of native rights. And of late\r\nyears it had become plain to them that the views of their opponents\r\nwere being acted upon at the Colonial Office, while their complaints\r\nwere wholly disregarded.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes of dissatisfaction, besides those above mentioned,\r\ncontributed to the impulse of emigration, but all in a very slight\r\ndegree. Judge Cloete, in his 'Five Lectures,' mentions the severe\r\npunishment inflicted upon the frontier insurgents of 1815 as one of\r\nthem; and there is no doubt that it was so with some families, though\r\nno trace of it can be found in the correspondence of the emigrants.\r\nThe substitution in 1827 of the English for the Dutch language in the\r\ncolonial courts of law was certainly generally felt as a grievance.\r\nThe alteration in 1813 of the system of land tenure, the redemption\r\nin 1825 of the paper currency at only thirty-six hundredths of its\r\nnominal value, and the abolition in 1827 of the courts of landdrost\r\nand heemraden, unquestionably caused much dissatisfaction, though all\r\nof these measures are now admitted by everyone to have been\r\nbeneficial. The long delay in issuing titles to farms, the cost of\r\nwhich has been paid to Government years before, is mentioned as a\r\ngrievance in some of the declarations.\r\n\r\nTwo parties--men, women, and children--numbering ninety-eight in all,\r\npioneered the great trek; of these twenty-six survived fever and\r\nfighting, loss of provisions, waggons, and cattle, and a long weary\r\ntramp from Zoutpansberg to Delagoa Bay, and were rescued and taken\r\nthence to Natal, and two children were carried off by the natives.\r\nThe survivors were three women with their twelve children--seven\r\norphan children and four youths. Not a single grown man escaped.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1836 preparations for emigration were being made\r\nover the eastern and midland districts. The Governor was perfectly\r\nhelpless in the matter. The Attorney-General, Mr. A. Oliphant, was\r\nconsulted by the Governor, and gave his opinion that 'it seemed next\r\nto an impossibility to prevent persons passing out of the colony by\r\nlaws in force, or by any which could be framed.' On August 19 Sir\r\nBenjamin D'Urban wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Andries\r\nStockenstrom, that 'he could see no means of stopping the emigration,\r\nexcept by persuasion, and attention to the wants and necessities of\r\nthe farmers.' In that direction the Governor had done all that was in\r\nhis power, but he could not act in opposition to the instructions of\r\nthe Secretary of State. Sir Andries Stockenstrom himself, in replying\r\nto an address from the inhabitants of Uitenhage, stated that 'he\r\nwas not aware of any law which prevented any of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects from leaving his dominions and settling in another country;\r\nand such a law, if it did exist, would be tyrannical and\r\noppressive.'\r\n\r\nThe story of the trekkers is one of surpassing interest, and must\r\nenlist for them the sympathy and unbounded admiration of all.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the year 1837 there were over one thousand waggons\r\nbetween the Caledon and Vaal rivers--truly a notable and alarming\r\nexodus; and the Boers then began the work of carving out new\r\ncountries for themselves. Their history surpasses all fiction in its\r\nvicissitudes, successes, and tragedies. They fought and worked and\r\ntrekked, onward, always onward--never returning--on beyond the\r\nfurthermost outposts of civilization.\r\n\r\nAnd so the story rolls on, gaining pathos, but losing no whit of\r\ninterest from its eternal sameness. They fought, and worked, and\r\nstarved, and died for their land of promise, where they might hope to\r\nbe alone, like the simple people of their one Book; where they might\r\nnever know the hated British rule; where they might never experience\r\nthe forms and trammels, the restlessness and changes, the worries,\r\nthe necessities or benefits, of progressing civilization. Their\r\nquarrel had been with the abuses and blunders of one Government; but\r\na narrow experience moved them to mistrust all but their own pastoral\r\npatriarchal way, moulded on the records of the Bible, and to regard\r\nthe evidences of progress as warnings of coming oppression and\r\ncurtailment of liberty, and a departure from the simple and ideal\r\nway. The abuses from which they suffered are no more; the methods\r\nwhich were unjust have been abandoned; the ignorance of the ruler has\r\nbeen dispelled; in place of despotism there is autonomy; justice\r\nrules where ignorance and bias sat; liberty where there was\r\ninterference; protection for oppression; progress and civilization\r\nhave increased as in no other epoch; and the nation and Government\r\nfrom which they severed themselves have taken their place in the very\r\nforefront of all. But the Boer sees with the eyes of sixty years ago!\r\n\r\nThe ideal was impossible, the struggle hopeless, the end certain.\r\nThey trekked, and trekked and trekked again; but the flag of\r\nEngland--emblem of all they hated--was close by; behind, beside,\r\nin front, or over them; and the something which they could not\r\nfight--the ever-advancing tide of civilization--lapped at their\r\nfeet, and slowly, silently, and for ever blotted out the line where\r\nthey had written, 'Thus far and no further.'\r\n\r\nThe South African Republic had been in existence as an independent\r\nState for twelve years when it reached that condition of insolvency\r\nwhich appeared to invite, or at least justify, annexation, as the\r\nonly alternative to complete ruin and chaos. And there are very few,\r\neven among the most uncompromising supporters of the Boers, who\r\nseriously attempt to show that the Transvaal had any prospect of\r\nprolonging its existence as an independent State for more than a few\r\nmonths when Sir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it in 1877. The\r\nfollowing picture is from a book published by the late Alfred\r\nAylward, the Fenian, more anti-British than the Boer himself, who was\r\npresent at the time, and wrote his book in order to enlist sympathy\r\nfor the movement then (1878) organized to obtain a cancellation of\r\nthe annexation. The value of Aylward's testimony would not be fairly\r\nappreciated without some explanation.\r\n\r\nSir Bartle Frere describes him (and quotes Scotland Yard authorities\r\nwho knew him well) as one of the party who murdered the policeman at\r\nManchester, and one of the worst and most active of the dynamiting\r\nIrishmen--a professional agitator, who boasted of his purpose to\r\npromote the Transvaal rebellion. Major Le Caron, too, stated on oath\r\nbefore the Parnell Commission that money was sent by the Irish Rebel\r\nSocieties, through Aylward, to stir up the Transvaal rebellion. This\r\nis what Aylward says:\r\n\r\nAll South Africa was for the moment at rest, with the exception of\r\nthe district of Utrecht, where an old-standing grievance with\r\nCetewayo was the cause of some little alarm and excitement (_i.e._,\r\nCetewayo's threatened invasion). Still, the Transvaal was disturbed\r\nthroughout its whole extent by the expectation of some pending\r\nchange--a change coming from the outside, which had been invited by\r\nan active, discontented party, chiefly foreigners, dwellers in towns,\r\nnon-producers, place-hunters, deserters, refugees, land-speculators,\r\n'development-men,' and pests of Transvaal society generally, who\r\nopenly preached resistance to the law, refusal to pay taxes, and\r\ncontempt of the natural and guaranteed owners of the country in\r\nwhich they lived, in the distinctly expressed hope that foreign\r\nintervention would fill the country with British gold, and conduce\r\nto their own material prosperity. The Boers, spread over a country\r\nlarger than France, were stunned into stupor by the demonstrative\r\nloudness of the party of discontent. In some districts they (the\r\nBoers) were poor, and could not readily pay the taxes imposed upon\r\nthem by the wars and railway projects of the Government. Their\r\nVolksraad was in Session, but its every action was paralyzed by the\r\ngloom of impending dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe Republic owed £215,000, which it had no immediate means of\r\npaying. Its creditors were clamorous; whilst the Executive, turn to\r\nwhich side it would, found itself confronted by threats, reproaches,\r\naccusations of slavery and cruelty based upon hearsay, and which,\r\nlike the annexation that steadily approached, could not be met,\r\nbecause neither of them had yet assumed the evidenced consistency of\r\nactual fact. There was no public opinion to support the Government or\r\nto save the Republic. The Boers lived far apart from each other,\r\nwhilst the annexationists and the party of disorder dwelt, in compact\r\ncommunities, in towns and mining villages. Into the midst of this\r\nconfusion--into the capital of this bewildered State--entered Sir\r\nTheophilus Shepstone and his staff. He had not come to seize the\r\ncountry--he had come as 'an adviser, as a helper, and as a friend';\r\nbut his advent was a blight--an incubus which rendered additionally\r\npowerless the unfortunate President and his Council. The coming of\r\nSir Theophilus Shepstone was, to the minds of nearly all, but too\r\nclearly the forerunner of change. In the face of this additional\r\nwhet to the anticipations of the party of disturbance, something\r\nthat has been described as anarchy prevailed. Everyone waited; all\r\nfell into a state of expectation; no one attempted to save the State,\r\nor repel the danger. At the same time, there was no anarchy in the\r\nproper sense of the word. Justice sat on her seat; criminals were\r\narrested and brought to trial; actions at law were heard and\r\ndetermined; and in no one place, save the goldfields, was authority,\r\neven for a moment, defied. There the law vindicated itself without\r\nhaving used violence or shed one drop of blood. Not one single\r\npublic outrage, not one unpunished crime, marked this period of\r\nsuspense, which is described by partizan writers as a time of\r\nchaos and anarchy.\r\n\r\nPeace was granted to Secocoeni, and the quietness and gloom of the\r\ncountry became even more profound.\r\n\r\nNow, had a commission, royal or joint, been opened in Pretoria to\r\ninquire into the truth of the allegations made against the\r\nGovernment, history might perhaps be able to record that judgment,\r\nfollowed by justice, had overtaken the Transvaal. No commission was\r\nopened. There was a banquet and a ball. The suspense increased in\r\nintensity. Understrappers, and agents of the discontented faction,\r\nfilled the country with rumours of impending annexation, and\r\nsometimes of impending conquest. The Boers, the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry, asked day after day what was the mission of the English\r\nCommissioner. They visited him in hundreds; but he knew the wonderful\r\nadvantage to be gathered from the heightening of the mystery, and the\r\nintensifying of the excitement. He listened to everyone; but he\r\nmaintained a gloomy and impassive silence, neither checking the\r\naspirations of the annexationists, nor dissipating the forebodings of\r\nthe farmers.\r\n\r\nNews arrived that troops were marching towards, and massing on,\r\nTheophilus sought not to alleviate the anxieties of the Government,\r\nnor to quell the now rising alarm amongst the people; he simply sat\r\nstill and listened, watching the writhings and stragglings of the\r\ndoomed Volksraad, and awaiting a favourable moment to end its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAt length someone determined to ask: 'Was it not possible to avert\r\nthis annexation which loomed before every mind, brooding like a\r\nshadow upon the country?' He went to Sir Theophilus; he asked his\r\nquestion; and at length the oracle spoke. Without moving a muscle of\r\nhis wonderfully impassive countenance, without even raising his eyes\r\nto look at the interlocutor, Sir Theophilus calmly murmured: 'It is\r\ntoo late!--too late!' And so, without the authorization of the home\r\nGovernment, without the consent of her Majesty's High Commissioner,\r\nwithout the concurrence of the Volksraad, against the will of\r\nthirty-nine-fortieths of the people, and in defiance of the protest\r\nof their Executive, as Mr. Anthony Trollope puts it, Sir Theophilus\r\nsaid: 'Then and from thenceforth the Transvaal shall be British\r\nproperty!' So he put up the Queen's flag.\r\n\r\nNow, it is impossible to conceive anything more admirable for its\r\ndiscretion, more wisely calculated as to the moment of its\r\noccurrence, or more suavely and yet firmly done than this act. There\r\nwas not a blow struck, not a shot fired; and the first impulse of\r\nnearly every person in the country, whether in principle opposed to\r\nannexation or not, was to congratulate Sir Theophilus Shepstone on\r\nthe skill, tact, and good fortune with which he had put an end to the\r\nexcessive anxiety, the mental strain, the fears, hopes, and\r\nexpectations by which the whole country was paralyzed. Whether the\r\nannexation be now held to be right or wrong, its execution, so far as\r\nregards the act itself, was an unparalleled triumph of tact, modesty,\r\nand firmness.\r\n\r\nIt was not discovered at the moment, and it never entered into any\r\nman's mind to consider, that it was the presence in Pretoria of Sir\r\nTheophilus himself that had created the anxiety, and caused the\r\nparalysis; and that it was his arts and presence that had tightened\r\nand strung up into quivering intensity the mind of the country. He\r\nhad broken the spell; he had introduced certainty in place of\r\nuncertainty; and he was congratulated, and very properly so, for the\r\nmanner in which he had brought to a conclusion his hazardous mission.\r\n\r\nSir Theophilus Shepstone's despatches record his negotiations with\r\nPresident Burgers, and the arrangement which allowed him to make a\r\nformal protest against the annexation, so as to satisfy his\r\nIrreconcilables, whilst he in reality not only assented to the\r\nmeasure, but even assisted the completion of it, and discussed the\r\ndetails with Shepstone, who in turn had revised President Burgers'\r\n'protest.'\r\n\r\nOn April 3, 1877, Shepstone had written to Frere:\r\n\r\nMr. Burgers, who had been all along, as far as his conversation and\r\nprofessions to me went, in full accord with me, had suddenly taken\r\nalarm; he made impossible proposals, all of which involved infinite\r\ndelay, and, of course, dangerous agitation. As far as I am concerned,\r\nleave the country, civil war would at once take place, as the natives\r\nwould consider it the sunshine in which they could make hay in the\r\nTransvaal; the goldfields are in a state of rebellion against the\r\nTransvaal Government, and they are kept from overt acts only by my\r\nwarnings and entreaties.\r\n\r\nAnd eight days later he wrote to Mr. Robert Herbert enclosing his\r\nletter under 'flying seal' to Frere:\r\n\r\nThere will be a protest against my act of annexation issued by the\r\nGovernment, but they will at the same time call upon the people to\r\nsubmit quietly, pending the issue; you need not be disquieted by such\r\naction, because it is taken merely to save appearances, and the\r\nmembers of the Government from the violence of a faction that seems\r\nfor years to have held Pretoria in terror when any act of the\r\nGovernment displeased it.\r\n\r\nYou will better understand this when I tell you privately that the\r\nPresident has from the first fully acquiesced in the necessity for\r\nthe change, and that most of the members of the Government have\r\nexpressed themselves anxious for it; but none of them have had the\r\ncourage openly to express their opinions, so I have had to act\r\napparently against them; and this I have felt bound to do, knowing\r\nthe state and danger of the country, and that three-fourths of the\r\npeople will be thankful for the change when once it is made.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning Mr. Burgers came to me to arrange how the matter\r\nshould be done. I read to him the draft of my Proclamation, and he\r\nproposed the alteration of two words only, to which I agreed. He\r\nbrought to me a number of conditions which he wished me to insert,\r\nwhich I have accepted, and have embodied in my Proclamation. He told\r\nme that he could not help issuing a protest, to keep the noisy\r\nportion of the people quiet--and you will see grounds for this\r\nprecaution when I tell you that there are only half a dozen native\r\nconstables to represent the power of the State in Pretoria, and a\r\nconsiderable number of the Boers in the neighbourhood are of the\r\nlowest and most ignorant class. Mr. Burgers read me, too, the draft\r\nof his protest, and asked me if I saw any objection to it, or thought\r\nit too strong. I said that it appeared to me to pledge the people to\r\nresist by-and-by; to which he replied that it was to tide over the\r\ndifficulty of the moment, seeing that my support, the troops, were a\r\nfortnight's march distant, and that by the time the answer to the\r\nprotest came, all desire of opposition would have died out. I\r\ntherefore did not persuade him from his protest.\r\n\r\nYou will see, when the proclamation reaches you, that I have taken\r\nhigh ground. Nothing but annexation will or can save the State, and\r\nnothing else can save South Africa from the direst consequences. All\r\nthe thinking and intelligent people know this, and will be thankful\r\nto be delivered from the thraldom of petty factions, by which they\r\nare perpetually kept in a state of excitement and unrest, because the\r\nGovernment, and everything connected with it, is a thorough sham.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement with President Burgers was a most improper\r\ncompromise on both sides. Moreover, Shepstone received the protests\r\nof the Executive Council and of the Volksraad before he issued his\r\nproclamation. He had plenty of evidence to show that even if his\r\naction was approved by the majority, the Boers were sufficiently\r\ndivided to demand some delay. He knew that the members of the\r\nGovernment and of the Raad would not face the responsibility of\r\nrelinquishing the State's independence, although he received\r\nprivate assurances and entreaties encouraging him to act. He had\r\nrepresentations and deputations from the Boers themselves,\r\nsufficient in weight and number to warrant his belief that a large\r\nproportion of the people desired annexation. He should not have\r\nallowed the 'hedging' that was practised at his expense. The Boer\r\nleaders were 'between the devil and the deep sea.' There can be no\r\ndoubt whatever that they dearly loved and prized their independence,\r\nand would have fought even then for it had they been in a position\r\nto preserve and profit by it; but they were not. They dared neither\r\nask for relief at the price of annexation, nor reject the proffered\r\nrelief at the price of continuing the hopeless struggle. So they\r\ncompromised. They took the relief, they accepted pay of the new\r\nGovernment, and entered a protest, so as to put themselves right\r\nwith the records and stand well with untamed ones of the party.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Annexation is so generally condemned by the friends and\r\nsympathizers of the Boers, and is so persistently quoted by them as\r\nthe cause of the Boer War, that it is only right to show clearly what\r\nthe opinion was at that time; and if it be deemed that overmuch space\r\nis given to this matter, the answer is, that it is quoted now as the\r\ncrime which gave rise to the present hatred and mistrust of England,\r\nand it is all-important that the truth should be clear.\r\n\r\nThis is what Mr. J.F. Celliers, the patriotic editor of the Boer\r\nnewspaper, _De Volksstem_, wrote in reviewing the work of the special\r\nsession of the Volksraad, convened to deal with the questions of Lord\r\nCarnarvon's Federation Bill, and the rescuing of the country from\r\nruin and chaos:--'During the session we have repeatedly had occasion\r\nto comment on the doings of the Raad. These comments have not been\r\nfavourable, and we regret to say that we have found in the closing\r\nscenes of our Legislature no reason to alter our opinions.' Then\r\nfollows a scathing account of the 'work done,' in which occur such\r\nreferences as:--'With the exception of a couple of members,\r\nno one had the sense or manliness to go into the question of\r\nconfederation'; and 'The most surprising feature of the whole\r\naffair was this--that most of the speakers seemed not to have the\r\nfaintest conception of the desperate condition in which the country\r\nstood....' And again, under date of March 28: 'About three months\r\nago we said we would prefer confederation under the British flag if\r\nthe state of anarchy then threatening were to continue. We know that\r\na good and stable Government is better than anarchy any day.'\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the writer of the above is the same Mr.\r\nCelliers who, two years later, was put in gaol by Colonel Lanyon on a\r\ncharge of sedition, because he attacked the Administration for its\r\nfailure to keep the promises made at the time of annexation.\r\n\r\nThree thousand out of eight thousand voters actually signed petitions\r\nin favour of annexation. In the Raad, President Burgers openly\r\nreproached members for proclaiming in public, and for improper\r\nreasons, views diametrically opposed to those privately expressed on\r\nthe confederation and annexation questions; and refused to consult\r\nwith three out of four members appointed as a deputation to confer\r\nwith him on these subjects, because they had not paid their taxes,\r\nand had so helped by example, not less than by the actual offence, to\r\ncause the ruin of the country and the loss of independence. And on\r\nMarch 3 President Burgers read an address to the Raad, in which the\r\nfollowing words occur:\r\n\r\n'I would rather be a policeman under a strong Government than the\r\nPresident of such a State. It is you--you members of the Raad and the\r\nBoers--who have lost the country, who have sold your independence for\r\na _soupe_ (a drink).

[Mr.\r\nMare: 'This is not true.'] 'Then it is not true what the honourable\r\nmember, Mr. Breytenbach, has told us about the state of the Lydenburg\r\ndistrict; then it is not true either what another member has said\r\nabout the farms in Zoutpansberg, which are occupied by Kaffirs.\r\nNeither is it true, then, what I saw with my own eyes at Lydenburg,\r\nwhere the burghers had been driven off their farms by the Kaffirs,\r\nand where Johannes was ploughing and sowing on the land of a burgher.\r\nThese are facts, and they show that the strongest man is the master\r\nhere. The fourth point which we have to take into account affects our\r\nrelations with our English neighbours. It is asked, What have they\r\ngot to do with our position? I tell you, as much as we have to do\r\nwith that of our Kaffir neighbours.

It was not this or\r\nthat thing which impeded their way, but they themselves stopped the\r\nway; and if they asked him what prevented the people from remaining\r\nobstruction, owing to the inherent incapacity and weakness of the\r\npeople. But whence this weakness? Was it because they were deformed?\r\nbecause they were worse than other people? because they were too few\r\nand too insignificant to occupy the country? Those arguments did not\r\nweigh with him. They were not true; he did not consider them of any\r\nimportance. The people were as good as any other people, but they\r\nwere completely demoralized; they had lost faith in God, reliance\r\nupon themselves, or trust in each other. Hence he believed they were\r\ninherently weak.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nHe did not believe that a new constitution would save them; for as\r\nlittle as the old constitution had brought them to ruin, so little\r\nwould a new constitution bring them salvation.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe Great Powers, with all their greatness, all their thousands of\r\nsoldiers, would fall as quickly as this State had fallen, and even\r\nmore quickly, if their citizens were to do what the citizens of this\r\nState had done; if the citizens of England had behaved towards the\r\nCrown as the burghers of this State had behaved to their Government,\r\nEngland would never have stood as long as she had, not even as long\r\nas this State had stood. This State owed obligations to other\r\ncountries; they knew that the fire which had nearly consumed this\r\nState would, if felt by them, very soon consume them also.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn several of the cities of Holland there were people who had\r\nsubscribed for only one debenture, because they thought men of their\r\nown blood were living in South Africa. What was the consequence? The\r\ninterest up to July last had been paid; in January of this year\r\n£2,250 was due for interest, and there was not a penny to meet it.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nTo take up arms and fight was nonsense; to draw the sword would be to\r\ndraw the sword against God, for it was God's judgment that the State\r\nwas in the condition it was to-day; and it was their duty to inquire\r\nwhether they should immerse in blood the thousands of innocent\r\ninhabitants of this country, and if so, what for? For an idea--for\r\nsomething they had in their heads, but not in their hearts; for an\r\nindependence which was not prized. Let them make the best of the\r\nsituation, and get the best terms they possibly could; let them agree\r\nto join their hands to those of their brethren in the south, and then\r\nfrom the Cape to the Zambesi there would be one great people. Yes,\r\nthere was something grand in that--grander even than their idea of a\r\nRepublic--something which ministered to their national feeling. And\r\nwould this be so miserable? Yes; this would be miserable for those\r\nwho would not be under the law, for the rebel and revolutionist, but\r\nwelfare and prosperity for the men of law and order.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThey must not underrate their real and many difficulties. He could\r\npoint to the south-western border, the Zulu, the goldfields, and\r\nother questions, and show them that it was their duty to come to an\r\narrangement with the British Government, and to do so in a bold and\r\nmanly manner. An hon. member on Saturday last had spoken with a\r\nfervent patriotism; but he had failed to appreciate the reference,\r\nbecause it amounted to this--that they must shut their eyes to\r\neverything, so as to keep their independence.\r\n\r\nPresident Burgers, who left the Transvaal broken-hearted, more by the\r\ncruel and mean intriguing and dissensions among, and disloyalty of,\r\nhis own people, which made the annexation possible, than by the Act\r\nitself, when dying left a statement of the case. It is too long to\r\nreproduce in its entirety. He shows how the English faction worked\r\nfor annexation, and how the Dopper party, headed by Kruger, allied\r\nthemselves with the former in intrigue against the Government,\r\nthwarting all effort at reform and organization, and encouraging the\r\nrefusal to pay taxes. He states plainly that this course was pursued\r\nby Kruger in order to oust him from power, and secure the Presidency\r\nfor himself. He shows how he opposed 'that other element which had\r\nformerly worked in secret, viz., British interference, which got a\r\nstrong support from the Boers themselves, and one of their chief\r\nleaders, P. Kruger, who had betrayed me, after promising me his and\r\nhis party's support.' He gives the final scene as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Volksraad had gone away, having done nothing but harm. The\r\nmembers of the Executive had gone home, as if all were safe, and I\r\nsat with a half-new Cabinet and part of an old one, half discharged.\r\nYet I made one attempt more, and drafted a letter to Shepstone,\r\nintimating that I would oppose the annexation by force of arms, etc.;\r\nand showed this to two members of the Executive. The response to my\r\nappeal, however, was so weak (one of them being in league with the\r\nEnglish) that I had to abandon the project, and try to prepare for\r\nthe worst. When, therefore, Shepstone's announcement came--that he\r\ncould wait no longer, that he had given us time enough to reform, and\r\nthat he must issue his proclamation--I could do no more than advise a\r\nprotest, and an appeal to foreign powers. This having been agreed to\r\nby my Government, I met Shepstone in presence of the Executive, and\r\nwhat could be saved for the country, such as its language, its\r\nlegislature, the position of its officials, etc., was arranged.\r\nBefore issuing his proclamation, Shepstone desired to see copies of\r\nboth mine and the Government protest. This I promised, on condition\r\nhe showed me his proclamation before publication: to which he agreed.\r\nTo one clause I greatly objected, and protested--namely, the threat\r\nof confiscation of property for disobeying the proclamation. I\r\npointed out that this was barbarous, and would be punishing a man's\r\ninnocent family for his actions. The clause was omitted. This is\r\nthe origin of the lie that I helped Shepstone in drawing up this\r\nproclamation. In justice to Shepstone, I must say that I would not\r\nconsider an officer of my Government to have acted faithfully if he\r\nhad not done what Shepstone did; and if the act was wrong (which\r\nundoubtedly it was), not he, but his Government, is to blame for it.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Kruger and Jorissen left within a month to protest in England\r\nagainst the annexation.\r\n\r\nSir T. Shepstone wrote (May 9): 'Mr. Paul Kruger and his colleague,\r\nDr. Jorissen, D.D., the Commission to Europe, leave to-day. I do not\r\nthink that either of them wishes the Act of Annexation to be\r\ncancelled; Dr. Jorissen certainly does not.' And Mr. J.D. Barry,\r\nRecorder of Kimberley, wrote to Frere (May 15): 'The delegates, Paul\r\nKruger and Dr. Jorissen, left Pretoria on the 8th, and even they do\r\nnot seem to have much faith in their mission. Dr. Jorissen thinks\r\nthat the reversal of Sir Theophilus's Act would not only be\r\nimpossible, but a great injury to the country.'\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to seek hostile testimony to establish the fact\r\nthat the Boers as a whole acquiesced in the annexation; the\r\nforegoing quotation from Aylward's book supplies all that is\r\nneeded--unintentionally, perhaps. The Zulu menace, which Aylward so\r\nlightly dismisses, was a very serious matter; the danger a very real\r\none. It has frequently been asserted by the Boers and their friends\r\nthat the Zulu trouble was fomented by a section of the Natal people,\r\nand that Sir Theophilus Shepstone himself, if he did not openly\r\nencourage the Zulu King in his threats and encroachments on the\r\nTransvaal, at any rate refrained from using his unique influence and\r\npower with the Zulus in the direction of peace, and that he made a\r\nnone too scrupulous use of the Zulu question when he forced the\r\nannexation of the Transvaal. It is stated that, in the first place,\r\nthere was no real danger, and in the next place, if there were, such\r\nwas Sir Theophilus's power with the Zulus that he could have averted\r\nit; and in support of the first point, and in demolition of Sir T.\r\nShepstone's pro-annexation arguments, the following extract from the\r\nlatter's despatches is quoted by Aylward and others:\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM DESPATCH, DATED UTRECHT, TRANSVAAL, JANUARY 29, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Sir T. Shepstone to Sir H. Bulwer_.\r\n\r\nPar. 12. 'Although this question has existed for many years, and the\r\nsettlement of it has been long postponed, yet on no former occasion\r\nhas it assumed so serious an aspect, or included so wide an area of\r\nterritory; never before has there existed any bar to the farmers\r\noccupying their farms after an absence more or less temporary, caused\r\nby a temporary and local scare. Practically, the line of occupied\r\nfarms has not been heretofore affected by the dispute about the\r\nbeaconed boundary, but now the prohibition to these has become\r\nabsolute by Zulu claims and action. Ruin is staring the farmers in\r\nthe face, and their position is, _for the time, worse under Her\r\nMajesty's Government than ever it was under the Republic_.'\r\n\r\nHad Sir T. Shepstone's power been as great as represented, it is fair\r\nto suppose that it would have been exerted, and would have prevailed\r\nin support of his own administration; but it seems clear that he\r\ncould do nothing; and as to the reality of the danger, nothing could\r\nbetter establish that than the unpleasant admissions in the foregoing\r\nextract and the initial disasters in the Zulu War a year later. The\r\nBoers' protective power was not lessened by the annexation--quite\r\notherwise. It was supplemented by British money, arms, and soldiers,\r\nand the prestige of the British flag, and yet things happened as\r\nabove described. What would they have been under the old conditions?\r\n\r\nThe day before he issued the proclamation Sir T. Shepstone sent a\r\nmessenger to Cetewayo, telling him that the Transvaal would be under\r\nBritish sovereignty, and warning him against aggression in that\r\ndirection. Cetewayo replied: 'I thank my father Somtseu (Shepstone)\r\nfor his message. I am glad that he has sent it, because the Dutch\r\nhave tired me out, and I intended to fight with them once, only once,\r\nand to drive them over the Vaal. Kabana, you see my impis are\r\ngathered. It was to fight the Dutch I called them together. Now I\r\nwill send them back to their houses.' (C. 1883, p. 19.)\r\n\r\nColonel A.W. Durnford; R.E., in a memorandum of July 5, 1877, wrote:\r\n\r\nAbout this time (April 10) Cetewayo had massed his forces in three\r\ncorps on the borders, and would undoubtedly have swept the Transvaal,\r\ncountry not been taken over by the English. In my opinion, he would\r\nhave cleared the country to Pretoria.\r\n\r\n'I am convinced,' wrote Sir A. Cunynghame, June 12, from Pretoria,\r\n'that had this country not been annexed, it would have been ravaged\r\nby the native tribes. Forty square miles of country had been overrun\r\nby natives, and every house burned, just before the annexation.' And\r\nhe wrote again, July 6: 'Every day convinces me that unless this\r\ncountry had been annexed it would have been a prey to plunder and\r\nrapine from the natives on its border, joined by Secocoeni, Mapok,\r\nand other tribes in the Transvaal. Feeling the influence of the\r\nBritish Government, they are now tranquil.'\r\n\r\nSo much for the reality of the danger. As to the causes of it and the\r\nalleged responsibility of Natal, Sir Bartle Frere, in a letter to\r\nGeneral Ponsonby, made the following remarks:\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that while the Boer Republic was a rival and\r\nsemi-hostile power, it was a Natal weakness rather to pet the Zulus\r\nas one might a tame wolf, who only devoured one's neighbour's sheep.\r\nWe always remonstrated, but rather feebly; and now that both flocks\r\nbelong to us, we are rather embarrassed in stopping the wolf's\r\nravages.\r\n\r\nSir B. Frere realized fully the dangers, and gave his testimony as to\r\nBoer opinion. On December 15, 1877, he wrote, concerning his policy\r\ntowards the Zulus:\r\n\r\nMy great anxiety is, of course, to avoid collision, and I am\r\nsatisfied that the only chance I have of keeping clear of it is to\r\nshow that I do not fear it. The Boers are, of course, in a state of\r\ngreat apprehension, and I have ordered those of the two frontier\r\ndistricts of Utrecht and Wakkerstroom to hold themselves in\r\nreadiness, should I find it necessary to call upon them for active\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSir T. Shepstone also wrote, concerning the reality of the danger,\r\nunder date December 25:\r\n\r\nThe Boers are still flying, and I think by this time there must be a\r\nbelt of more than a hundred miles long and thirty broad, in which,\r\nwith three insignificant exceptions, there is nothing but absolute\r\ndesolation. This will give your Excellency some idea of the mischief\r\nwhich Cetewayo's conduct has caused.\r\n\r\nAnd again (April 30, 1878):\r\n\r\nI find that Secocoeni acts as a kind of lieutenant to Cetewayo. He\r\nreceived directions from the Zulu King, and these directions are by\r\nSecocoeni issued to the various Basuto tribes in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nSir T. Shepstone rushed the annexation. He plucked the fruit that\r\nwould have fallen. He himself has said that he might have waited\r\nuntil the Zulus actually made their threatened murderous raid. That\r\nmight have been Macchiavelian statecraft, but it would not have been\r\nhumanity; and there was nothing in the attitude of the Boer leaders\r\nat the time of the annexation which foreshadowed the fierce and\r\ndetermined opposition which afterwards developed. The fact seems to\r\nbe that the people of the Transvaal were either in favour of the\r\nannexation, or were overpowered and dazed by the hopelessness of the\r\nRepublic's outlook; and they passively assented to the action of Sir\r\nTheophilus Shepstone and his twenty-five policemen. The Boers were\r\nquite unable to pay the taxes necessary to self-government and the\r\nprosecution of the Kaffir wars. The Treasury was empty--save for the\r\nmuch-quoted 12s. 6d. The Government £1 bluebacks were selling at 1s.\r\nCivil servants' salaries were months in arrear. The President\r\nhimself--the excitable, unstable, visionary, but truly enlightened\r\nand patriotic Burgers--had not only drawn no salary, but had expended\r\nhis private fortune, and incurred a very heavy liability, in the\r\nprosecution of the unsuccessful Secocoeni war. No amount of _ex post\r\nfacto_ evidence as to the supposed feelings and opinions of the Boers\r\ncan alter a single one of the very serious facts which, taken\r\ntogether, seemed to Sir Theophilus to justify the annexation. But it\r\nall comes down to this: If the passive acquiescence in the annexation\r\ncoincided strangely with the Republic's failure to defeat its enemies\r\nand pay its debts, it is no whit less odd that Lord Carnarvon's\r\nanxiety for the Republic's safety synchronized with his attempt to\r\nconfederate South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe real mistakes of the British Government began _after_ the\r\nannexation. The failure to fulfil promises; the deviation from old\r\nways of government; the appointment of unsuitable officials, who did\r\nnot understand the people or their language; the neglect to convene\r\nthe Volksraad or to hold fresh elections, as definitely promised;\r\nthe establishment of personal rule by military men, who treated the\r\nBoers with harshness and contempt, and would make no allowance for\r\ntheir simple, old-fashioned ways, their deep-seated prejudices, and,\r\nif you like, their stupid opposition to modern ideas: these things\r\nand others caused great dissatisfaction, and gave ample material for\r\nthe nucleus of irreconcilables to work with.\r\n\r\nDuring the occupation period Mr. Kruger took office under the British\r\nGovernment, as also did Dr. Jorissen and Chief Justice (then Judge)\r\nKotzé, and indeed all the officials who had protested against the\r\nannexation, except Mr. Piet Joubert, who declined to do so, and who,\r\nif actions be the test and not words, was the only honest protestant.\r\nMr. Kruger retained his office for some time after he had concerned\r\nhimself in the Repeal agitation, but finally resigned his post on\r\nbeing refused an increased remuneration, for which he had repeatedly\r\napplied. There can be but little doubt that had this inducement been\r\nforthcoming, he would have remained a loyal British subject.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the annexation was to start the wells of plenty\r\nbubbling--with British gold. The country's debts were paid. Secocoeni\r\nand Cetewayo would be dealt with, and the responsibility for all\r\nthings was on other and broader shoulders. With the revival of trade,\r\nand the removal of responsibilities and burdens, came time to think\r\nand to talk. The wave of the magician's wand looked so very simple\r\nthat the price began to seem heavy. The eaten bread was forgotten.\r\nThe dangers and difficulties that were past were of small account now\r\nthat they _were_ past; and so the men who had remained passive, and\r\nrecorded formal protests when they should have resisted, and taken\r\nsteps to show that they were in earnest, began their Repeal\r\nagitation. All the benefits which the Boers hoped from the annexation\r\nhad now been reaped. Their pressing needs were relieved. Their debts\r\nhad been paid; their trade and credit restored; their enemies were\r\nbeing dealt with. Repeal would rob them of none of these; they would,\r\nin fact, eat their cake and still have it. The Zulu question had been\r\ntaken up, and could not now be left by the Imperial Government to\r\nsettle itself. The debts discharged for them and the outlays incurred\r\nmight, it is true, be charged to them. They could not be repaid, of\r\ncourse, for the same reason that you cannot get blood from stone;\r\nand the amount would, therefore, be a National Debt, which was\r\nexactly what they had been trying for years to incur, and the\r\ncondition of their credit had made it impossible to do.\r\n\r\nThe causes of discontent before given were serious, but the failure\r\nto fulfil promises was not deliberate. Circumstances combined to\r\nprevent Sir Bartle Frere from visiting the Transvaal, as intended and\r\npromised. Native wars (Gaika and Galeka), disagreements between the\r\nColonial and Imperial authorities, the obstructions and eventual\r\ndismissal of the Molteno-Merriman Ministry--the first under\r\nResponsible Government--Natal and Diamond-fields affairs, and, above\r\nall, the Zulu War, all combined to prevent Sir Bartle Frere from\r\nfulfilling his obligations to settle Transvaal matters.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime two deputations had been sent to England,\r\nrepresenting the Boers' case against annexation. The active party\r\namong the Boers, _i.e._, the Voortrekker party, the most anti-British\r\nand Republican, though small in itself, had now succeeded in\r\ncompletely dominating the rest of the Boers, and galvanizing them\r\ninto something like national life and cohesion again--a result\r\nachieved partly by earnest persuasion, but largely also by a kind of\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\nSir Bartle Frere, who managed at last to visit the Transvaal, in\r\nApril, 1879, had evidence of this on his journey up, and in a\r\ndespatch to Sir M. Hicks Beach from Standerton on the 6th of that\r\nmonth he wrote:\r\n\r\nI was particularly impressed by the replies of a very fine specimen\r\nof a Boer of the old school. He had been six weeks in an English\r\nprison, daily expecting execution as a rebel, and had been wounded by\r\nall the enemies against whom his countrymen had fought--English,\r\nZulus, Basutos, Griquas, and Bushmen.\r\n\r\n'But,' he said, 'that was in the days of my youth and inexperience.\r\nHad I known then what I know now, I would never have fought against\r\nthe English, and I will never fight them again. Old as I am, I would\r\nnow gladly turn out against the Zulus, and take fifty friends of my\r\nown, who would follow me anywhere; but I dare not leave my home till\r\nassured it will not be destroyed and my property carried off in my\r\nabsence, by the men who call me \"rebel\" because I will not join them\r\nagainst the Government. My wife, brought up like a civilized woman in\r\nthe Cape Colony, has had five times in her life to run from the house\r\nand sleep in the veld when attacked by Zulus and Basutos. One of our\r\ntwelve sons was assegaied in sight of our house, within the last ten\r\nit was surrounded by Basutos, my wife had to fly in the night by\r\nherself, leading one child and carrying another on her back. She\r\nwalked nearly fifty miles through the Lion Veld, seeing three lions\r\non the way, before she reached a place of safety. It is not likely\r\nthat we should forget such things, nor wish them to recur; but how\r\ncan I leave her on my farm and go to Zululand, when the malcontent\r\nleaders threaten me that if I go they will burn my house and drive\r\noff all my stock? Assure me that we are not to be deserted by the\r\nEnglish Government, and left to the mercy of these malcontent\r\nadventurers, and I and my people will gladly turn out to assist\r\nColonel Wood.'\r\n\r\n_I find that this idea that the English Government will give up the\r\nTransvaal, as it formerly did the Orange Free State, has been\r\nindustriously propagated, and has taken a great hold on the minds of\r\nthe well-disposed Boers, and is, I believe, one main cause of\r\nreluctance to support the Government actively_.\r\n\r\n_They argue that what has been done before may be done again, and\r\nthey have no feeling of assurance that if they stand by the English\r\nGovernment to-day they will not be left to bear the brunt of the\r\nmalcontents' vengeance when a Republic is established_.\r\n\r\nAnd again on the 9th, from Heidelberg:\r\n\r\n_The idea that we should somehow be compelled or induced to abandon\r\nthe country had taken great hold on the minds of some of the more\r\nintelligent men that I met_. It has been seduously written up by a\r\nportion of the South African press, English as well as Dutch. I\r\nmarked its effect particularly on men who said they had come from the\r\nold Colony since the annexation, but would never have done so had\r\nthey believed that English rule would be withdrawn, and the country\r\nleft to its former state of anarchy....\r\n\r\n_But there is great practical difficulty in conveying to the mass of\r\nthe people any idea of the real power of Government_.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to pen a more severe and pregnant comment on the\r\nafter-policy of England than that suggested by the italicized lines,\r\nwritten as they were by England's Plenipotentiary--an idea reported\r\nto headquarters, not as a feeler, but as a suggestion so absurd that\r\nit called for no expression of opinion. But he lived to find that it\r\nwas not too absurd to be realized; and perhaps, after all, it was\r\nwritten as a warning, and the wise and cool-headed old statesman in\r\nhis inmost soul had a premonition of what eventually occurred.\r\n\r\nSir Bartle Frere met the Boers in their camp, and discussed with them\r\ntheir grievances. He informed them that he had no power to revoke the\r\nannexation, nor would he recommend it, as, in his judgment, such a\r\ncourse would be a reversion to chaos and ruin. The Boers pressed\r\nsteadily for nothing less than repeal. Sir Bartle Frere reported\r\nthe historical meeting at Erasmus Farm to Sir M. Hicks Beach:\r\n\r\n  _April 14, 1879._\r\n\r\nThey were evidently much disappointed.... Our meeting separated with\r\nno more definite decision than that they must report to the 'people,'\r\nand be guided by their decision as to what was to be done.\r\n\r\nIf I may judge from the gentlemen composing the deputation, and\r\nothers of their class, whom I have had the honour of meeting since\r\ncoming to the Transvaal, the leaders are, with few exceptions, men\r\nwho deserve respect and regard for many valuable and amiable\r\nqualities as citizens and subjects....\r\n\r\nOf the results of our meeting it is impossible at present to say more\r\nthan that it must have cleared away misconceptions on all sides If\r\nthey have learnt anything as to the finality of the act of\r\nannexation--that I have no power to undo it, and do not believe that\r\nit will ever be undone, in the only sense in which they will ask\r\nit--I have, on the other hand, been shown the stubbornness of a\r\ndetermination to be content with nothing else, for which I was not\r\nprepared by the general testimony of officials who had been longer in\r\nthe country, and who professed to believe that the opposition of the\r\nBoers was mere bluster, and that they had not the courage of their\r\nprofessed opinions.... I feel assured that the majority of the\r\nCommittee felt very deeply what they believed to be a great national\r\nwrong.... But my conviction is that the real malcontents are far from\r\nbeing a majority of the whole white population, or even of their own\r\nclass of Boer farmers.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt whatever that if the Executive were in a position to\r\nassert the supremacy of the law, to put an effectual stop to the\r\nreign of terrorism which exists at present, the discontented minority\r\nwould cease to agitate, and would soon cease to feel grievances which\r\na very brief discussion shows to be in the main sentimental; not the\r\nless keenly felt on that account, but not likely to survive\r\nthe prosperity and good government, with a fair measure of\r\nself-government in its train, which are within their reach under\r\nBritish rule.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, he wrote to Lady Frere:\r\n\r\n  PRETORIA, _April 20, 1879._\r\n\r\nMy last letter had not been gone many hours by the mail express when\r\nLanyon ran into my room, to tell me that the Boer camp was actually\r\nbroken up and the Boers dispersing.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you how thankful I was. The one thing I dreaded was\r\ncivil war and bloodshed, and had a single malcontent been shot, I\r\nshould have considered it a greater misfortune than the death of a\r\ndozen Piet Retiefs, or Uys, dying like heroes in the field of battle\r\nfor their country and brethren. So you may imagine how thankful I\r\nfelt to the Giver of all good, who has guided and protected us\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nI am to see a deputation from the Boers' Committee again to-morrow,\r\nand then I hope we shall have done with meetings and grievances--for\r\nthe present a phrase which they carefully put into all references to\r\ntheir breaking up, and which they evidently mean. _It was clear to me\r\nthat it was not the annexation, so much as the neglect to fulfil the\r\npromises and the expectations held out by Shepstone when he took\r\nover the Government, that has stirred up the great mass of the\r\nBoers, and given a handle to agitators._{02}\r\n\r\nThere it is in a single sentence! It was not the annexation which\r\ncaused the war; for nine men in every ten admitted that it was\r\nwelcomed and justified by considerations of general South African\r\npolicy, or else simply inevitable. No! It was the failure to fulfil\r\nthe conditions of annexation!\r\n\r\nIn 'A Narrative of the Boer War,' Mr. Thomas Fortescue Carter has\r\ngiven with admirable skill and impartiality a full account of the\r\ncauses which led to the outbreak. His history is, indeed, so\r\ndeterminedly just as to have met with considerable disapproval in\r\nquarters where feelings are hot on either side, and where plain\r\ntruths are not palatable. Mr. Carter resided in the country for years\r\nbefore the annexation, and went through the war as correspondent of a\r\nwell-known London daily, and this is his opinion:\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows the acquaintance Sir T. Shepstone had with the Boers\r\nof the Transvaal, years prior to the annexation, cannot doubt that,\r\nregarded as a friend and almost as one of themselves, no one better\r\nthan he could have been selected for the task of ascertaining the\r\ndesires of the people; and no one who knows Sir T. Shepstone will\r\nbelieve that he did not take sufficient evidence to prove to any man\r\nthat the Boers were anxious to be extricated from the dilemma they\r\nwere in, and really willing at that time that their country should be\r\nannexed. Men who during the late war were our foes were at the time\r\nof the annexation clamouring for it, welcoming Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone as the deliverer and saviour of the country. I mention\r\nSwart Dirk Uys, an eminent Boer, who fought against the English in\r\n1880-81, as one amongst the hundreds and thousands who went out to\r\nmeet Sir Theophilus Shepstone with palm branches in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe natural aversion of the people to English rule was overcome for\r\nthe moment by their greater aversion to being wiped off the face of\r\nthe Transvaal by the blacks; that was a contingency staring them in\r\nthe face, and yet not even that imminent common danger availed to\r\nsecure unity amongst them, or would rouse men individually to take\r\nupon their shoulders the responsibility which rests upon every member\r\nof a State.\r\n\r\nThe Boer Volksraad, after promising to appeal to their constituents\r\non the subject of the new constitution proposed, almost immediately\r\npassed a measure, which was familiarly styled by the people the 'Hou\r\njou smoel law.' The literal translation of this term is 'Hold your\r\nto discuss the question of either confederation or annexation.\r\n\r\nI come to the conclusion, then, that the cause of the annexation was\r\nEngland's historical greed of territory, especially rich territory;\r\nand that, however unworthy the motive on the part of the visiting\r\npower, the Boers did not at that time receive the visitor with other\r\nfeelings than those of satisfaction, and practically surrendered\r\ntheir country voluntarily and gladly to the ruler of a greater power,\r\nunder the impression that Sir Theophilus Shepstone would be permitted\r\nto carry out, and that he therefore would carry out, the promises he\r\nmade them. As the programme was open before them, they had everything\r\nto gain and nothing to lose, except the loss entailed by nominal\r\ngovernment by the British. No man, whether Boer or Britisher, who was\r\nliving in the Transvaal, or knew the feelings of the Boers at the\r\ntime of annexation, would in 1877 have given any other account of the\r\nfeeling of the nation; and if I have formed too low an opinion of the\r\nmotives of English statesmen at that time, and am not justified in\r\nattributing the annexation to greed instead of to the purer and\r\nnobler desire to protect England's colonies, or even the Transvaal\r\nitself, from the inroads of savages, then my excuse must be that the\r\nfailure of England to send out at that time a force equal to the task\r\nof restraining those savages and maintaining peace, has helped\r\nmaterially to lead me to the unwarrantable conclusion.{03}\r\n\r\nAnd so came the war. The history of it is written that all may read;\r\nand it is not necessary here to refer at length to the details of it.\r\nThe utterly unjust treatment of Bezuidenhout at Potchefstroom was the\r\nimmediate cause of the outbreak. The armed interference of the\r\nPotchefstroom burghers with the Imperial officials followed on\r\nDecember 16, to be in turn succeeded by the battle of Bronkhorst\r\nSpruit on the 20th.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the affair is taken from Mr. Carter's book:\r\n\r\nAll went well on this day till about 2.30 p.m., when the following\r\nwas about the order of march: One mounted infantryman in advance of\r\nthe main body next the band; of F company, forty men; of A company,\r\nforty men; then followed the quarter-guard, thirteen men; and\r\nprovost-escort and prisoners, twenty-three men. The remainder of the\r\nforce was posted along the string of waggons, with the exception of\r\nthe rear-guard of about twenty men, which were some distance behind.\r\nColonel Anstruther, Captains Nairne and Elliott, Lieutenant Hume,\r\nand Adjutant Harrison were riding just in front of the band, when\r\nsuddenly Boers appeared all round. The locality that the regiment had\r\nreached at the time was one where stood several farms, and the trees\r\nsurrounding these homesteads afforded cover under which a hostile\r\nforce could assemble without being perceived from a distance. On the\r\nright was a ravine with wood in it, and amongst that the Boers were\r\nlying in ambush. How unexpected was the appearance of a force of\r\nBoers to the English may be judged from the fact that the band\r\nof the regiment was playing at the time. Colonel Anstruther,\r\nimmediately he caught sight of the enemy on the crest of a slight\r\nrise to the front, called a halt, and the order was passed to the\r\nrear for the waggons to close up. Before this could be done a\r\nmessenger from the enemy, carrying a white flag, came forward and\r\nhanded the Colonel a note signed by Piet Joubert, and countersigned\r\nby other Boer leaders, desiring him to halt where he was until a\r\nreply had been received from Sir Owen Lanyon to the ultimatum the\r\nBoers had addressed to him. The message also contained the warning\r\nthat if the soldiers advanced beyond a small stream in front of\r\nthem, it would be taken as a declaration of war. Colonel Anstruther,\r\nwith Conductor Egerton, had ridden out in front of the advanced\r\nguard to meet this flag of truce; after he had read the message, the\r\nbearer of it informed him verbally that two minutes were allowed for\r\nhis decision. Colonel Anstruther verbally replied that he should\r\nmarch on to Pretoria, and, to use his own words, as published in his\r\ndespatch written just before he died, the Boer messenger 'said that\r\nhe would take my message to the Commandant-General; and I asked him\r\nto let me know the result, to which he nodded assent. Almost\r\nimmediately, however, the enemy's line advanced.'\r\n\r\nWhilst this short parley was going on, every effort was being made in\r\nthe rear to get the waggons up, but without much good result, because\r\nwhen the Boers opened fire the rear-guard would be at least half a\r\nmile behind the head of the column. Even those who were guarding the\r\nwaggons had not time to join the main body. When Colonel Anstruther\r\nsaw the Boers advancing, he gave the order to his men to extend in\r\nskirmishing order, but before they could open out to more than loose\r\nfiles they were met with a murderous volley, and at the same time\r\nBoers on the right and left flank and in the rear, who had previously\r\nmeasured and marked off the distances, picked off every man within\r\nsight. Our men returned the fire as best they could, but in less than\r\nten minutes 120 were either killed or wounded, besides a large\r\nproportion of the oxen in the waggons shot. The officers who exposed\r\nthemselves were picked off almost immediately by the Boer marksmen.\r\nCaptain Nairne, Lieutenant M'Sweeney, Lieutenant and Adjutant\r\nHarrison, Lieutenant Hume, Deputy-Assistant Commissary-General\r\nBarter, Conductor Egerton, Surgeon Ward, were all wounded, besides\r\nColonel Anstruther himself, who was shot in two or three places.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to contend against such odds, and the 'cease fire' was\r\nsounded, and handkerchiefs waved to denote submission. During this\r\nunequal struggle, Mrs. Smith, the widow of the bandmaster of the\r\nregiment, who, with the wife of Sergeant-Major Fox and some children,\r\nwere riding in one of the foremost waggons, came fearlessly up to\r\nwhere the wounded lay, and, tearing strips from her clothing, helped\r\nthe surgeon to bandage the wounds. The sergeant-major's wife was\r\nseverely wounded, as was also Fox himself. There was no lack of\r\nheroism during those awful ten minutes, whilst men were being shot\r\ndown like dogs. Lieutenant Harrison was shot through the head while\r\ncheering on his men; Lieutenant Hume was equally conspicuous\r\nfor his coolness. An orderly-room clerk named Maistre and the\r\nSergeant-Master-Tailor Pears quietly concealed the regimental colours\r\nin a waggon-box when they saw the danger of them falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy; and their work was not in vain, as Conductor\r\nEgerton managed subsequently to wrap them round his body under his\r\ntunic, and having obtained permission after the fight was over to walk\r\nto Pretoria for medical assistance, he carried them safely to the\r\ncapital, as well as the disastrous news of the engagement. Forty-two\r\nmiles traversed by a wounded man on foot in eleven hours is in itself\r\na feat worth mentioning, and one the value of which can only be\r\nreally estimated by those who know what South African roads are in\r\nthe rainy seasons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our force surrendered, Franz Joubert, who had been in\r\ncommand of the Boers, and who, it is said, fired the first shot, with\r\nthe exclamation, 'What is the use of waiting?' came forward with some\r\nof his men, and on finding poor Colonel Anstruther severely wounded\r\nexpressed sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhether the affair of Bronkhorst Spruit can be called an act of\r\ntreachery on the part of the Boers is rather a nice question. Colonel\r\nAnstruther's words--the words of a dying man--rather go to prove that\r\nhe was unfairly treated, though he does not say so directly. He was\r\ngiven to understand by the messenger who came with the flag of truce\r\nthat another communication would be made to him as soon as his reply\r\nto the request to halt had been reported to the Boer Commandant. The\r\nonly reply given him was 'a murderous volley.' The Boers cannot lay\r\nclaim to much bravery or superiority (except in numbers) over our\r\nsoldiers in this fight. Theirs was a deliberately-planned ambush to\r\nentrap men who had no idea that they were marching in an enemy's\r\ncountry. Bronkhorst Spruit engagement is the one during the whole of\r\nthe war which does not redound to the credit of the Dutch, even if it\r\ndoes not reflect great discredit upon them. If a reasonable time had\r\nbeen allowed Colonel Anstruther to give his reply, the 94th could not\r\nthen say, as they do say and will say, that they were treacherously\r\nsurprised. 'Two minutes' looks, under the circumstances, very much\r\nlike an idle pretence of fair dealing to cover an intentional act of\r\ncowardice which subsequent conduct could hardly palliate. The Boers\r\nsay that they had not more men than were marching with the 94th on\r\nthat occasion; that statement is worth very little, considering the\r\nevidence of our officers, and, above all, the harsh evidence of the\r\nfacts that the 94th was from advance-guard to rear-guard practically\r\nsurrounded and outnumbered in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe preparedness of the Boers and the precision of their fire may be\r\ngathered from the testimony of Dr. Crow, of Pretoria, who attended\r\nthe wounded, and vouched for an average of five wounds per man. Dr.\r\nCrow also wrote:\r\n\r\nBut as disastrous as the late war in the Transvaal had been to\r\nBritish prestige, thank God those at Bronkhorst Spruit did their duty\r\nand died like men, a noble example to any army. If any stain has been\r\ncast on the British flag in the Transvaal, the gallant 94th did all\r\nthat was possible by their deeds at Bronkhorst Spruit to obliterate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe news of this affair was received with horror, and the feelings\r\nroused by the details of it have never been allayed. Race-hatred may\r\nhave its origin in a hundred little incidents, but in the Transvaal\r\nthere were two which undoubtedly, whether justly or otherwise, gave\r\na character to the Boers that has embittered feeling against them\r\nmore than any which had occurred in generations previous. The\r\nsecond affair followed very closely on the Bronkhorst Spruit\r\nengagement--_i.e.,_ the infamous murder of Captain Elliott, the only\r\nsurviving unwounded officer from Bronkhorst Spruit. Captains Elliott\r\nand Lambert were taken prisoners, and were offered the choice of\r\ntwo alternatives--either to remain prisoners of war during the\r\nhostilities in the Transvaal, or to be released on _parole\r\nd'honneur_ on condition that they should leave the Transvaal at\r\nonce, cross into the Free State under escort, and not bear arms\r\nagainst the Republican Government during the war. The second\r\nalternative was chosen. They received an escort and free pass from\r\nCommandant-General Piet Joubert. The following is extracted from\r\nCaptain Lambert's Report to Sir George Colley on January 5:\r\n\r\nWe started about 1 p.m. from the Boer camp, passing through the town\r\nof Heidelberg. After going about six to eight miles, I noticed we\r\nwere not going the right road, and mentioned the fact to the escort,\r\nwho said it was all right. Having been 'look-out' officer in the\r\nTransvaal, I knew the district well. I was certain we were going\r\nwrong, but we had to obey orders. At nightfall we found ourselves\r\nnowhere near the river drift, and were ordered to outspan for the\r\nnight, and next morning the escort told us they would look for the\r\ndrift. Inspanning at daybreak, we again started, but after driving\r\nabout for some hours across country, I told the escort we would stop\r\nwhere we were while they went to search for the drift. Shortly after\r\nthey returned and said they had found it, and we must come, which we\r\ndid, eventually arriving at the junction of two rivers (Vaal and\r\nKlip), where we found the Vaal impassable, but a small punt, capable\r\nof holding only two passengers at most, by which they said we must\r\ncross. I pointed out that it was impossible to get my carriage or\r\nhorses over by it, and that it was not the punt the General said we\r\nwere to cross. The escort replied it was Pretorius's punt that the\r\nGeneral told them to take us, and we must cross; that we must leave\r\nthe carriage behind and swim the horses, which we refused to do, as\r\nwe then should have had no means of getting on. I asked them to show\r\nme their written instructions, which they did (written in Dutch), and\r\nI pointed out that the name of Pretorius was not in it. I then told\r\nthem they must either take us back to the Boer camp again or on to\r\nthe proper drift. We turned back, and after going a few miles the\r\nescort disappeared. Not knowing where we were, I proposed to Captain\r\nElliott we should go to the banks of the Vaal, and follow the river\r\ntill we came to the proper punt. After travelling all Monday,\r\nTuesday, and up till Wednesday about 1 p.m., when we found ourselves\r\nfour hours, or twenty-five miles, from Spencer's punt, we were\r\nsuddenly stopped by two armed Boers, who handed us an official\r\nletter, which was opened, and found to be from the Secretary to the\r\nRepublican Government, stating that the members were surprised that,\r\nas officers and gentlemen, we had broken our _parole d'honneur_, and\r\nrefused to leave the Transvaal; that if we did not do so immediately\r\nby the nearest drift, which the bearers would show us, we must\r\nreturn as prisoners of war; that as through our ignorance of the\r\nlanguage of the country there might be some misunderstanding, they\r\nwere loth to think we had willingly broken our promise. We explained\r\nthat we should reply to the letter, and request them to take it to\r\ntheir Government, and were prepared to go with them at once. They\r\ntook us back to a farmhouse, where we were told to wait until they\r\nfetched their commandant, who arrived about 6 p.m., and repeated to\r\nus the same that was contained in our letter of that day. We told\r\nhim we were ready to explain matters, and requested him to take our\r\nanswer back to camp. He then ordered us to start at once for the\r\ndrift. I asked him, as it was then getting dark, if we could start\r\nearly next morning, but he refused. So we started, he having said we\r\nshould cross at Spencer's, being closest. As we left the farmhouse,\r\nI pointed out to him that we were going in the wrong direction; but\r\nhe said, 'Never mind; come on across a drift close at hand.' When we\r\ngot opposite it, he kept straight on; I called to him, and said that\r\nthis was where we were to cross. His reply was, 'Come on!' I then\r\nsaid to Captain Elliott, 'They intend taking us back to Pretoria,'\r\ndistant some forty miles. Suddenly the escort (which had all at once\r\nincreased from two to eight men, which Captain Elliott pointed out\r\nto me; and I replied, 'I suppose they are determined we shall not\r\nescape, which they need not be afraid of, as we are too keen to get\r\nover the border') wheeled sharp down to the river, stopped, and,\r\npointing to the banks, said, 'There is the drift--cross!' I drove my\r\nhorses into the river, when they immediately fell; lifted them, and\r\ndrove on about five or six yards, when we fell into a hole. Got them\r\nout with difficulty, and advanced another yard, when we got stuck\r\nagainst a rock. The current was now so strong and drift deep, my\r\ncart was turned over on to its side, and water rushed over the seat.\r\nI called out to the commandant on the bank that we were stuck and to\r\nsend assistance, or might we return, to which he replied, 'If you\r\ndo, we will shoot you.' I then tried, but failed, to get the horses\r\nto move. Turning to Captain Elliott, who was sitting beside me, I\r\nsaid, 'We must swim for it'; and asked could he swim, to which he\r\nreplied, 'Yes.' I said, 'If you can't, I will stick to you, for I\r\ncan.' While we were holding this conversation, a volley from the\r\nbank, ten or fifteen yards off, was fired into us, the bullets\r\npassing through the tent of my cart, one of which must have mortally\r\nwounded poor Elliott, who only uttered the single word 'Oh!' and\r\nfell headlong into the river from the carriage. I immediately sprang\r\nin after him, but was swept down the river under the current some\r\nyards. On gaining the surface of the water, I could see nothing of\r\nElliott, but I called out his name twice, but received no reply.\r\nImmediately another volley was fired at me, making the water hiss\r\naround where the bullets struck. I now struck out for the opposite\r\nbank, which I reached with difficulty in about ten minutes; but as\r\nit was deep, black mud, on landing I stuck fast, but eventually\r\nreached the top of the bank, and ran for about two hundred yards\r\nunder a heavy fire the whole while.\r\n\r\nThe Boers then invaded Natal and took up a position on Laing's Nek,\r\nfour miles inside the Natal border, from which, on January 28, Sir\r\nGeorge Colley endeavoured to oust them with a mounted force of 70 men\r\nand some 500 men of the 58th Regiment. The position is one difficult\r\nenough to climb unencumbered by military accoutrements, but the\r\ndisposition of the little mounted force covered the approach. By some\r\nunexplained mistake, however, half of the mounted infantry charged\r\nand carried the Boer position before the 58th had climbed the hill,\r\nbut were too weak to hold it and retired, leaving the 58th uncovered\r\nin a terrible ascent. But few of the exhausted men reached the top of\r\nthe hill, and those, led by Colonel Deane, only to be shot down. Of\r\nthe mounted men, 17 were killed and wounded; of the 58th, 73 were\r\nkilled and 100 wounded. The result was absolute defeat of the British\r\nforces. The number of Boers engaged is not known, but the force\r\nbehind the Nek consisted of several thousands, and no doubt a fair\r\nproportion engaged in the fight.\r\n\r\nOn February 8 General Colley made a demonstration in force on the\r\nIngogo Heights. The force consisted of under 300 men, with 4 guns and\r\n38 mounted men. On the Boer side there were about 1,000 men, and the\r\nfight lasted from morning until after dark. It was a drawn fight, in\r\nwhich both parties left the battlefield at night. There cannot be any\r\ndoubt, however, that the balance of advantage was with the Boers,\r\nsince the loss on the British side was very severe: 76 men were\r\nkilled and 69 wounded.\r\n\r\nOn February 27 came Majuba, when Sir George Colley designed to\r\nretrieve his fortunes and strike an effective blow without the aid of\r\nhis second-in-command, Sir Evelyn Wood, whom he had sent to hurry up\r\nreinforcements. The scaling of the mountain at night was a fine\r\nperformance. The neglect to take the rocket apparatus or mountain\r\nguns, or to fortify the position in any way, or even to acquaint the\r\nmembers of the force with the nature of the position which they had\r\ntaken up in the dark, and the failure to use the bayonets, were the\r\nprincipal causes of disaster. The Boers attacked in force a position\r\nwhich should have been absolutely impregnable, held as it was by a\r\nforce of 554 soldiers. The Boer force is not known, but probably\r\nconsisted of upwards of 1,000 men, since Christian Joubert after the\r\nfight offered to take a portion of the men, numbering, as he said,\r\nsome 500, to attack a small British laager on one of the spurs of\r\nthe mountain. The splendid feat of taking the hill-top, however, was\r\naccomplished by a small storming party of less than 200 men, the\r\nbalance of the Boer forces covering the approach of their comrades\r\nby an accurate and incessant long-range fire. The result, as is\r\nknown, was terrible disaster: 92 killed and 134 wounded, and a\r\nnumber taken prisoners, represented the British loss, whilst the\r\nBoers lost 1 killed and 5 wounded. No attempt had been made to\r\noccupy positions below the crown of the hill which commanded the\r\napproaches, and the Boers were able to creep up under good cover\r\nfrom place to place by the exercise of their admirable tactics. It\r\nis impossible to detract from the performance of the Boers, and a\r\nglance at the position leaves one more astonished than ever that a\r\nsuccessful attack could ever have been made upon it. The Boers\r\ndisplayed on this day the finest fighting qualities. The generalship\r\nof their fighting Commandant, Nikolas Smit, was of the highest\r\norder. The cleverness of the attack, and the personal bravery and\r\naudacity of the storming party are beyond praise.\r\n\r\nBy the time Sir Evelyn Wood had ranged his forces for an effective\r\nand extended attack on the Boers, and by the time Sir Frederick\r\nRoberts with the command of about 10,000 men had reached South\r\nAfrica, the administration of Mr. Gladstone had awakened to the fact\r\nthat the war was an unjust--not to say costly--one. An armistice was\r\narranged and peace made without another blow.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the settlement proposed by the Liberal Government fitly\r\nillustrate the generosity of their motives. They proposed doing\r\n'simple justice' to the Boers, but at the same time retaining the\r\ndistricts of Lydenburg, Middelburg, Wakkerstroom, and Utrecht, not to\r\nmention handing back Zoutpansberg to the original native occupants.\r\nSo anxious were the Boer leaders to effect a peaceful settlement, so\r\nfearful were they of the actions of their followers, that when they\r\narranged the long armistice they did not announce to their party the\r\nintentions of the British Government regarding the above districts.\r\nGeneral Joubert did not communicate to his army the terms of peace,\r\nbut simply stated that a Royal Commission was to settle everything.\r\nA month later, when some inkling of the terms reached the Boers, a\r\nsolemn protest and warning was issued, and when the Royal Commission\r\nactually sat, the British representatives were informed that any\r\nsuch curtailment of the territories would be followed by a\r\nresumption of hostilities. Needless to say the proposals were\r\nabandoned and the Boers got their way. So ended the war.\r\n\r\nIngogo has been called a drawn battle. Bronkhorst Spruit was--such as\r\nit was. At Laing's Nek and Majuba the Boers beat us, as Mr. Carter\r\nfairly puts it, 'when they were on the top of the hill and we were at\r\nthe bottom, and when we were on the top of the hill and they were at\r\nthe bottom.' The narrative of these events is about as humiliating a\r\none as an Englishman can read. Here and there it is redeemed by the\r\nheroic conduct of individuals in the midst of general disaster. In\r\nthe smaller affairs, such as the particularly gallant defences of\r\nStanderton, Potchefstroom, and Rustenberg, where little garrisons\r\nheld their own with conspicuous ability and courage, there is\r\nsomething to cheer the disheartened reader. The defence of\r\nPotchefstroom by Colonel Winslow should be read in full for several\r\nreasons. The siege of Standerton witnessed several acts of valour,\r\nbut, above all, that of Hall the volunteer, who single handed\r\ndeliberately engaged a force of over 300 Boers, drawing their fire on\r\nhimself in order to warn his comrades of the danger of being cut off\r\nand to give them a chance of escape--a noble act in which the gallant\r\nfellow achieved his object but lost his life. It was in Rustenberg\r\nwhere Captain Auchinleck, with about seventy men armed only with\r\nrifles, held his laager against hundreds of the enemy, fighting day\r\nand night for weeks; and eventually drove off the Boers who were\r\ntrenching towards his position by charging at night with from nine to\r\nfourteen of his men and clearing the enemy out of the trenches with\r\nthe bayonet. This performance he repeated three times, himself badly\r\nwounded on each occasion. The impression created on the enemy by\r\nthese tactics was such that they overcame their desire to get at\r\nclose quarters with him, and left him severely alone.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to refer in great detail to the settlement In\r\neffect it was that the Boers gained nearly all that they required,\r\nbut not until the haggling and threatening had robbed concessions of\r\nall appearance of grace and justice. The natives were referred to in\r\nthe conventional spirit. The unfortunate loyalists were left to take\r\ncare of themselves. The men who had entered the Transvaal, and\r\ninvested their capital and expended their energies there upon the\r\nmost positive and sacred assurances of the British Government that\r\nthe Queen's authority would never be withdrawn,--assurances given in\r\npublic by the Conservative Government and confirmed by Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government, assurances published by Sir Bartle Frere and\r\nSir Garnet Wolseley, who said that 'as long as the sun would shine\r\nthe British flag would fly over the Transvaal,'--were heartlessly\r\nabandoned, their protests were unheeded, the compensation allotted to\r\nthem, namely, £1,400,000, was amended by the elimination of the\r\nmillion, their representations to Mr. Gladstone's Government were\r\nfinally left unanswered--unless it be that the sneering reference\r\nmade by that right honourable gentleman in the House of Commons to\r\n'interested contractors and landjobbers' may be considered an\r\nadequate answer to a protest as moderate, as able, as truthful, and\r\nas necessary as Mr. Gladstone's remark was the reverse. In very\r\ntruth, the position in which the British Premier had placed himself\r\nthrough his intemperate speeches in the Midlothian campaign, and his\r\nsubsequent 'explaining away,' was an extremely unpleasant one. In\r\nOpposition Mr. Gladstone had denounced the annexation and demanded a\r\nrepeal. On accession to power he adopted the policy of his\r\npredecessors, and affirmed that the annexation could never be\r\nrevoked. On June 8, 1880, he had written to this effect to Messrs.\r\nKruger and Joubert, the Transvaal deputation. Later on, in answer to\r\nan appeal that he should allay the apprehensions of the loyalists,\r\nwho feared the results of the Boer agitation, he referred them to\r\nthis very letter as a final expression of opinion, and authorized the\r\npublication of this message. When, however, peace had been concluded,\r\nand the loyalists, amazed and heartbroken at their threatened\r\ndesertion, reminded him of his pledges and implored him to respect\r\nthem, he answered them in a letter which is surely without parallel\r\nin the record of self-respecting Governments. The wriggling, the\r\nequivocation, the distortion of phrases, the shameless 'explaining\r\naway,' are of a character that would again justify the remark of\r\nLord Salisbury (then Lord Robert Cecil) in another matter many years\r\nbefore, that they were 'tactics worthy of a pettifogging attorney,'\r\nand even the subsequent apology--to the attorney. But what answer\r\ncould be made to a protest which reminded the right honourable\r\ngentlemen of the following deliberate and official expression of his\r\nGovernment's policy?--\r\n\r\nIn your letter to me (wrote Mr. White for the loyalists) you claim\r\nthat the language of your letter does not justify the description\r\ngiven. With the greatest respect I submit that it does, and I will\r\nquote the words on which I and also my colleagues base the opinion\r\nthat it does unequivocally pledge the Government to the\r\nnon-relinquishment of the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nThe actual words of your letter are:\r\n\r\n'Looking at all the circumstances, both of the Transvaal and the rest\r\nof South Africa, and to the necessity of preventing a renewal of the\r\ndisorders, which might lead to disastrous consequences, not only to\r\nthe Transvaal, but to the whole of South Africa, _our judgment is\r\nthat the Queen cannot be advised to relinquish the Transvaal_; but,\r\nconsistently with the maintenance of that sovereignty, we desire that\r\nthe white inhabitants of the Transvaal should, without prejudice to\r\nthe rest of the population, enjoy the fullest liberty to manage their\r\nlocal affairs.'\r\n\r\nBut your letter of the 8th of June not only contained this final and\r\nabsolute announcement of the policy of England, but it gave the\r\nreasons for arriving at it in words which so aptly express the case\r\nof the loyalists that I quote them _in extenso_. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n'It is undoubtedly matter for much regret that it should, since the\r\nannexation, have appeared that so large a number of the population of\r\nDutch origin in the Transvaal are opposed to the annexation of that\r\nterritory, _but it is impossible now to consider that question as if\r\nit were presented for the first time_. We have to do with a state of\r\nthings which has existed for a considerable period, _during which\r\nobligations have been contracted_, especially, though not\r\nexclusively, towards the native population, _which cannot be set\r\naside_.'\r\n\r\nIn your speech in the House of Commons, on the debate on Mr. Peter\r\nRylands' motion condemning the annexation of the country and the\r\nenforcement of British supremacy in it, which was defeated by a\r\nmajority of ninety-six, on the 21st of January in the current year,\r\nyou used words of similar import. You are reported in the _Times_ of\r\nthe 22nd of January as saying:\r\n\r\n'To disapprove the annexation of a country is one thing; to abandon\r\nthat annexation is another. Whatever we do, we must not blind\r\nourselves to the legitimate consequences of facts. By the annexation\r\nobligations entailed by the annexation, and if in my opinion, and in\r\nthe opinion of many on this side of the House, wrong was done by the\r\nannexation itself, _that would not warrant us in doing fresh,\r\ndistinct, and separate wrong by a disregard of the obligation which\r\nthat annexation entailed_. These obligations have been referred to in\r\nthis debate, and have been mentioned in the compass of a single\r\nsentence. First, there was the obligation entailed towards the\r\nEnglish and other settlers in the Transvaal, perhaps including a\r\nminority, though a very small minority, of the Dutch Boers\r\nthemselves; secondly, there was the obligation to the native races;\r\nand thirdly, there was the obligation we entailed upon ourselves in\r\nrespect of the responsibility which was already incumbent upon us,\r\nand which we, by the annexation, largely extended, for the future\r\npeace and tranquillity of South Africa.'\r\n\r\nNor was this all. The loyalists proceeded to remind him that Lord\r\nKimberley, his Secretary of State for the Colonies, had telegraphed\r\nin May, 1880, 'Under no circumstances can the Queen's authority in\r\nthe Transvaal be relinquished,' and had confirmed the telegram in a\r\ndespatch following; and that his lordship had also stated in the\r\nHouse of Lords on May 24 that '... after a careful consideration of\r\nthe position, we have come to the conclusion that we could not\r\nrelinquish the Transvaal. Nothing could be more unfortunate than\r\nuncertainty in respect to such a matter.' (Hansard, cclii., p. 208.)\r\n\r\nThe effects of the settlement, and the exposures in connection with\r\nit, and the attitude of the Imperial Government were most deplorable.\r\nNo credit was given by the Boers to a Government which was clearly\r\nmoved by the meanest considerations. No feeling but contempt,\r\ndisgust, and even hatred, could be entertained by the loyalists for\r\nthe Government which had so shamelessly deserted them. The settlement\r\nhas left its indelible mark upon the sentiment of South Africa. The\r\nwar, it will generally be admitted, was a most unfortunate\r\noccurrence. Only one thing could have been more unfortunate, and that\r\nwas such a settlement as actually was effected--a settlement which\r\nsatisfied no one, which outraged all, which threw South Africa into a\r\nstate of boiling discontent. In some quarters the defeats of Majuba\r\nand Laing's Nek rankled deeply; yet they were fair fights, and Time\r\ncan be trusted to allay the feelings of those who are worsted in a\r\nfair fight; but there were other matters which roused a spirit in\r\nthe English-speaking people of South Africa that had never been\r\nknown before.\r\n\r\nThe former records of the Boers, favourable and unfavourable, are\r\nconsistent with the records established in the War of Independence.\r\nNone dare belittle the spirit which moved them to take up arms\r\nagainst the greatest Power in the world. Their ignorance may have\r\nbeen great, but not so great as to blind them to the fact that they\r\nwere undertaking an unequal contest. It is not possible to say, with\r\ndue regard to their records, that they are not a courageous people.\r\nIndividual bravery, of the kind which takes no heed of personal risk,\r\nreckless heroic dash, they have not, nor do they pretend to have.\r\nTheir system is entirely otherwise. They do not seek fighting for\r\nfighting's sake. They do not like exposing themselves to risk and\r\ndanger. Their caution and their care for personal safety are such\r\nthat, judged by the standard of other people's conduct in similar\r\npositions, they are frequently considered to be wanting in personal\r\ncourage. It seems a hard thing to say of a people who have produced\r\nmen like the first Bezuidenhout, who fought and died single-handed\r\nagainst the British troops; men like Piet Retief, as gallant a man as\r\never walked; men like Piet Uys, an example to all men for all time,\r\nand only one of many generations in one family of equally gallant\r\nDutchmen; but it would truly seem that such examples do not occur\r\nwith such frequency among the Boers as among nations with whom they\r\nhave been compared. Where they have been able to choose their own\r\npositions, or where they have been stimulated by previous successes,\r\nthey have done all that could possibly be asked of them; but their\r\nparticular military system does not conduce to success under\r\ncircumstances where men are suddenly and unexpectedly called upon to\r\nexhibit the virtues of discipline, to make what to the individual may\r\nappear a useless sacrifice of life, or, in cold blood and in the face\r\nof previous defeat, to attempt to retrieve a lost position.\r\n\r\nThe Boer military power has been called the biggest unpricked bubble\r\nin the world. Whether this be so or not--whether the early conflicts\r\nbetween the British troops and the Boers in the Cape Colony and Natal\r\njustify the view that the Boers cannot take a beating and come up\r\nagain--is a matter for those to decide who will give their impartial\r\nattention to the records.\r\n\r\nWhilst conspicuous personal daring among the Boers may not be\r\nproverbial, it must be remembered to their everlasting credit that\r\nthey, as did the Southerners in the American Civil War, robbed the\r\ncradle and the grave to defend their country. Boys who were mere\r\nchildren bore rifles very nearly as long as themselves; old men, who\r\nhad surely earned by a life of hardship and exposure an immunity from\r\nsuch calls, jumped on their horses and rode without hesitation and\r\nwithout provision to fight for their independence.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, unfortunately, matters connected with the war\r\nwhich gave birth to a bitter and aching desire for revenge.\r\nBronkhorst Spruit and the murder of Captain Elliott were among the\r\nearliest. Another was the shooting of Dr. Barbour (who was killed\r\ninstantly) and Mr. Walter Dyas (wounded) by their escort under\r\ncircumstances similar to those of the Elliott murder, with the\r\nexception that in this case the prisoners had been released on foot\r\nand in daylight, and were then shot down.\r\n\r\nBut there were others too. There was the murder of Green in\r\nLydenburg, who was called to the Boer camp, where he went unarmed and\r\nin good faith, only to have his brains blown out by the Boer with\r\nwhom he was conversing; there was the public flogging of another\r\nEnglishman by the notorious Abel Erasmus because he was an Englishman\r\nand had British sympathies; and there were the various white flag\r\nincidents. At Ingogo the Boers raised the white flag, and when in\r\nresponse to this General Colley ordered the hoisting of a similar\r\nflag to indicate that it was seen, a perfect hail of lead was poured\r\non the position where the General stood; and it was obvious that the\r\nhoisting of the flag was merely a ruse to ascertain where the General\r\nand his staff were. There was the ambulance affair on Majuba, when\r\nthe Boers came upon an unarmed party bearing the wounded with the red\r\ncross flying over them, and after asking who they were and getting a\r\nreply, fired a volley into the group, killing Surgeon-Major Cornish.\r\nunder Commandant Cronjé were guilty of actions contrary to the usages\r\nof civilized warfare. They are matters of history, and can easily be\r\nverified. Reference is made to them elsewhere in this volume in\r\nconnection with Commandant Cronjé's action on another occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd so the war left the country, as wars will, divided into two\r\nparties, with feelings towards each other that are deplorable enough\r\nin themselves, and not easily allayed. The curtain was rung down, and\r\nthe scene was lost to the view of the world, but the play went on all\r\nthe same behind the curtain. And this is what the new Government said\r\nto the world on August 8, 1881, when they took over the\r\nadministration of the country:\r\n\r\nTo all inhabitants, without exception, we promise the protection of\r\nthe law, and all the privileges attendant thereon.\r\n\r\nTo inhabitants who are not burghers, and do not wish to become such,\r\nwe notify that they have the right to report themselves to the\r\nResident as British subjects, according to Article 28 of the now\r\nsettled Convention. But be it known to all, that all ordinary rights\r\nof property, trade, and usages will still be accorded to everyone,\r\nburgher or not.\r\n\r\nWe repeat solemnly that our motto is, 'Unity and reconciliation.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter I\r\n\r\n{01} Written in 1896.\r\n\r\n{02} Several of the letters and despatches given in this volume are\r\nquoted from Mr. Martineau's excellent 'Life of Sir Bartle Frere,' a\r\nportion of which book was lately published in cheaper form, under\r\nthe title of 'The Transvaal Trouble and How it Arose.'\r\n\r\n{03} It is only fair to state that _at that time_ the Home Government\r\nbelieved the prestige of the Imperial authority to be sufficient for\r\nall purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAFTER THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Sir Bartle Frere wrote, 'I have never been able to discover\r\nany principle in our policy in South Africa except that of giving way\r\nwhenever any difficulty or opposition is encountered.' The remark is\r\nstill as true as when it was penned, and South Africa--the 'Grave of\r\nReputations,'{04} as it has long been called--must by this time be\r\nregarded with doubtful emotions by successive Colonial Secretaries.\r\nWhat is it about South Africa, one asks, that has upset so many men\r\nof capacity and experience? Who can say? Often--most often--it is the\r\nneglect to thoroughly study and know what are called the 'local\r\nconditions,' and to pay due heed to local experience. Sometimes it is\r\nthe subordination of State policy to party considerations which has\r\nruined the Proconsul: witness Sir Bartle Frere, whose decisive\r\naction, firm character, and wise and statesmanlike policy are\r\nnow--now that he is dead--recognised universally, as they have always\r\nbeen in South Africa. Perhaps there is something in Africa itself\r\nwhich makes it a huge exception to the rules of other lands; the\r\nsomething which is suggested in the 'rivers without water, flowers\r\nwithout scent, and birds without song'; a contrariness which puts the\r\nalluvial gold on the top of mountain ranges and leaves the valleys\r\nbarren; which mocked the experience of the world, and showed the\r\nwaterworn gravel deposit to be the biggest, richest, deepest, and\r\nmost reliable gold reef ever known; which placed diamonds in such\r\nconditions that the greatest living authority, who had undertaken a\r\nhuge journey to report on the occurrence, could only say, in the face\r\nof a successful wash-up, 'Well, there _may_ be diamonds here, but all\r\nI can say is they've no right to be'; the something which many, many\r\ncenturies ago prompted the old Roman to write, 'Ex Africâ semper\r\naliquid novi affert,' and which is in the mind of the South African\r\nto-day when he says, 'The impossible is always happening in Africa.'\r\n\r\nThere is this to be said for the Gladstone Ministry in 1881: that,\r\nhaving decided on a policy of scuttle and abandonment, they did it\r\nthoroughly, as though they enjoyed it. A feeble vote-catching\r\nprovision, with no security attached, was inserted in the Pretoria\r\nConvention relative to the treatment of natives, but no thought or\r\ncare was given to the unfortunate British subject who happened to be\r\na white man, and to have fought for his Queen and country.{05} The\r\nabandonment was complete, without scruple, without shame. It has been\r\nwritten that 'the care and forethought which would be lavished on a\r\nfavourite horse or dog on changing masters were denied to British\r\nsubjects by the British Government.' The intensity and bitterness of\r\nthe resentment, the wrath and hatred--so much deeper because so\r\nimpotent--at the betrayal and desertion have left their traces on\r\nSouth African feeling; and the opinion of the might and honour of\r\nEngland, as it may be gleaned in many parts of the Colonies as well\r\nas everywhere in the Republics, would be an unpleasant revelation to\r\nthose who live in undisturbed portions of the Empire, comfortable in\r\nthe belief that to be a British subject carries the old-time magic of\r\n'Civis Romanus sum.'\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal State, as it was now to be called, was re-established,\r\nhaving had its trade restored, its enemies crushed--for Secocoeni and\r\nCetewayo were both defeated and broken--and its debts paid or\r\nconsolidated in the form of a debt to England, repayable when\r\npossible. For some time not even the interest on this debt was paid.\r\n\r\nNumbers of British subjects left the country in disgust and despair.\r\nRuined in pocket and broken in spirit, they took what little they\r\ncould realize of their once considerable possessions, and left the\r\ncountry where they could no longer live and enjoy the rights of free\r\nmen. For some years the life of a Britisher among the Boers was far\r\nfrom happy. It is not surprising--indeed, not unnatural--that people\r\nunsoftened by education and the conditions of civilization, moved by\r\nfierce race prejudice, and intoxicated by unbroken and unexpected\r\nsuccess, should in many cases make the vanquished feel the\r\nconqueror's heel. The position of men of British name or sympathies\r\nin the country districts was very serious, and the injustice done to\r\nthose who had settled since the annexation, believing that they were\r\nto live under the laws and protection of their own Government was\r\ngrave indeed.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the country was vested in a Triumvirate with Mr.\r\nStephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger as Vice-President during the period\r\nimmediately following the war; but in 1882 the old form was restored\r\nand Mr. Kruger was elected President, an office which he is now\r\nholding for the third successive term.{06}\r\n\r\nPrior to the war the population of the country was reckoned by both\r\nDutch and English authorities to be about 40,000 souls, the great\r\nmajority of whom were Dutch. The memorial addressed to Lord\r\nCarnarvon, dated January 7, 1878, praying for repeal of the\r\nannexation, was 'signed by 6,591 qualified electors out of a possible\r\n8,000,' as is explained in the letter of the Transvaal delegates to\r\nSir M. Hicks-Beach dated July 10, 1878. The fact, already mentioned,\r\nthat 3,000 electors had petitioned for the annexation only means that\r\nsome of them changed their minds under pressure or conviction, and\r\nhelped to swell the number of those who later on petitioned for\r\nrepeal. The signatories to the above memorial would include\r\npractically all the Dutch electors in the country, and the remaining\r\n1,400 or so would probably be the non-Boer party who preferred\r\nBritish rule, and could not be coerced into signing memorials against\r\nit. These figures are useful as a check upon those now put forward by\r\nthe Transvaal Government to combat the assertion that the Uitlanders\r\noutnumber the Boers. Recognizing the fact that the Boers are a\r\nsingularly domestic and prolific people, one may allow that\r\nthey numbered 35,000 out of the total population, an estimate that\r\nwill be seen to be extremely liberal. At the time that the above\r\nfigures were quoted by the Transvaal delegates every Boer youth over\r\nthe age of twenty-one was a qualified voter, so that it would seem\r\nthat the qualified Boer voter had an _average_ of one wife and 4.3\r\nchildren, a fair enough allowance in all conscience. These figures\r\nshould be borne in mind, for the present Boer population consists of\r\nwhat remains of these 35,000 souls and their natural increase during\r\neighteen years. There are other Dutch immigrants from the Cape\r\nColony and Free State: these are aliens, who have the invaluable\r\nqualification of hating England and her sons and her ways and\r\nher works; but, as will be made clear when the Franchise Law is\r\nexplained, the present Boer electorate consists-or, without fraud or\r\nfavouritism, _should_ consist-of the 'possible 8,000' and their\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nMany a champion of liberty has lived to earn the stigma of tyrant,\r\nand the Boers who in 1835 had trekked for liberty and freedom from\r\noppressive rule, and who had fought for it in 1880, began now\r\nthemselves to put in force the principles which they had so stoutly\r\nresisted. In the Volksraad Session of 1882 the first of the measures\r\nof exclusion was passed. The Franchise, which until then-in\r\naccordance with Law No. 1 of 1876-had been granted to anyone holding\r\nproperty or residing in the State, or, failing the property\r\nqualification, to anyone who had qualified by one year's residence,\r\nwas now altered, and Law No. 7 of 1882 was passed which provided that\r\naliens could become naturalized and enfranchised after five years'\r\nresidence, thus attaining the status of the oldest Voortrekker. The\r\nfeeling was now very strong against the Annexation Party, as they had\r\nbeen called, that is to say, the men who had had the courage of their\r\nconvictions, and had openly advocated annexation; and as usual the\r\nbitterest persecutors and vilifiers were found in the ranks of those\r\nwho, having secretly supported them before, had become suspect, and\r\nhad now need to prove their loyalty by their zeal. The intention was\r\navowed to keep the party pure and undiluted, as it was maintained\r\nby many of the Boers that former proselytes had used their\r\nnewly-acquired privileges to vote away the independence of the\r\ncountry. The view was not unnatural under the circumstances, and this\r\nmeasure, had it not been a violation of pledges, might have found\r\ndefenders among impartial persons; but unfortunately it proved to\r\nbe not so much a stringently defensive measure which time and\r\ncircumstances might induce them to modify, as the first step in a\r\npolicy of absolute and perpetual exclusion. It was the first\r\ndeliberate violation of the spirit of the settlement, and, although\r\nthere is no clause in the Pretoria Convention which it can be said\r\nto contravene, it was, as Mr. Chamberlain has since styled it, 'a\r\nviolation of the _status quo_ as it was present to the minds of her\r\nMajesty's Ministers at the time the Convention was negotiated.' But\r\nthe Gladstone Ministry, which had paid so heavily to get rid of the\r\nTransvaal question, was certainly not going to re-open it for the\r\nsake of holding the Boers to the spirit of the settlement.\r\n\r\nAnother precaution was taken to keep all the power in the hands of\r\nthe Boers. The various towns which had formerly been entitled to\r\nrepresentation in Parliament were deprived of this right, and have\r\nremained disfranchised ever since. Mr. Kruger feared that the\r\nenlightened thought of the towns would hinder the growth of his\r\n'national policy.'\r\n\r\nIt was not too late even at this time to have bloodlessly settled the\r\nTransvaal question for ever by a fair but thoroughly firm attitude\r\ntowards the restored Republic. No doubt British Ministers, conscious\r\nof an act of supreme self-restraint and magnanimity, believed that\r\nsome reciprocal justice would be evoked. At any rate, it is possible\r\nthat this was the reason which guided them, and not continued callous\r\nindifference to the fate of British subjects and the future of South\r\nAfrica. In such case, however, they must have forgotten 'the fault of\r\nthe Dutch'--which Andrew Marvell's couplet has recorded--of 'giving\r\ntoo little and asking too much.' The Transvaal Boers are very\r\npractical people, and no matter what they may receive or how they get\r\nit, whether by way of diplomacy or barter or the accident of good\r\nluck or deed of gift, they never neglect to press and scheme for\r\nmore. It is an unpleasant feature in the Boer character, prominent\r\nalike in personal and general relations, begotten, mayhap, of hard\r\nlife, constant struggle, and lack of education and its softening\r\nand elevating influence. It is a feature which is common to all\r\nuneducated peoples who have suffered great hardships, and it will no\r\ndoubt disappear in time; but it is one which has to be reckoned with\r\nat the present day, and one which, when recognized at its true value,\r\nsustains the contention that the Boers, in dealing with those whom\r\nthey regard as not of them, will recognise no right and do no justice\r\nunless compelled to do so. The considerations of a narrow and selfish\r\npolicy are stronger than the sense of right and wrong.\r\n\r\nBritish Ministers and the British people when glowing with a mildly\r\nenthusiastic satisfaction at their tolerant and even generous\r\nattitude towards a weaker opponent may imagine that they have sown\r\ngood seed which in time will bear ample fruit; but it is not so.\r\nNothing but firmness and strict justice will avert a bloody day of\r\nreckoning. Nothing but prompt and effective veto on every attempt to\r\nbreak or stretch the spirit of past undertakings will bring it home\r\nto the Transvaal Government that all the give cannot be on the one\r\nside and all the take on the other; that they cannot trade for ever\r\non the embarrassment of a big Power in dealing with a little one; and\r\nthat they must comport themselves with due regard to their\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first use made by the Transvaal Government of their\r\nrecovered power was one which has wrought much mischief to the State.\r\nThe Triumvirate who ruled the country in 1882 granted numbers of\r\nconcessions, ostensibly for the purpose of opening up industries or\r\ndeveloping mining areas. The real reasons are generally considered to\r\nhave been personal, and the result was the crushing of budding\r\nactivities, and the severe discouragement of those who were willing\r\nto expend capital and energies in legitimate work. Favouritism pure\r\nand simple dictated these grants. It is hardly too much to say that\r\nthe system and spirit then introduced rule to this day, for although\r\nthe Volksraad has taken definite resolution condemning the principle\r\nof monopolies and contracts conferring preferential rights of any\r\nsort, the spirit of this resolution is violated whenever the\r\nPresident and Executive deem it fit to do so--witness, for instance,\r\nthe monopoly granted in December, 1895, for the free importation\r\nof produce, which is disguised as a Government agency with a\r\n'commission' to the agent; but it is really a monopoly and\r\nnothing else!\r\n\r\nThe Boers were not satisfied with the Convention of 1881. They\r\ndesired the removal of the Suzerainty, the cancellation of the\r\nclauses referring to natives, and the restoration of the title of the\r\nSouth African Republic in lieu of that of the Transvaal State. They\r\nalso desired (but did not expect to obtain) complete freedom in\r\nregard to their external relations, and they lost no time in trying\r\nhow far they would be allowed to go in the direction of stretching\r\nthe spirit of the Convention. Nothing in that ineffectual and\r\nmiserable document is clearer than the definition of certain\r\nboundaries, and the provision that no extension shall be allowed.\r\nThis hemming of them in--or shutting them up in a kraal, as President\r\nKruger has expressively put it--was intensely repugnant to them. It\r\ncut into one of the most deeply-rooted habits of the Boer. His method\r\nof trek and expansion has been, to begin by making small hunting\r\nexcursions into adjacent native territories, to follow up with\r\ngrazing his cattle there until he created in his own mind a right by\r\nprescription, and then to establish it either by force or else by\r\nwritten agreement, too often imperfectly translated. This was\r\noftentimes varied or supplemented by helping the weaker of two rival\r\nchiefs, and so demolishing the power of a tribe. The expulsion of the\r\nnative followed as a natural result.\r\n\r\nIn the Transvaal itself there was, and still is, an immense quantity\r\nof unoccupied land, and the Boers were quite unable to properly\r\ncontrol, utilize, and administer their own immense territory, but\r\n'land hunger' is theirs as a birth curse. The individual cannot bear\r\nto see the smoke of his neighbour's chimney; he will not cultivate 50\r\nacres, but wants 50,000; the 'nation' wants Africa--no less. They\r\ncoveted Swaziland, Zululand, Bechuanaland, Matabeleland, Mashonaland,\r\nand Tongaland, and set to work by devious methods to establish claims\r\nto these countries.\r\n\r\nIn Bechuanaland they took sides; that is to say, parties of\r\nfreebooters from the Transvaal took up the cause of certain native\r\nchiefs against certain others. The London Convention in 1884\r\ndisposed of this quarrel by fixing the south-western boundaries\r\nof the Republic, and placing two of the disputing chiefs under\r\nthe Transvaal, and the other two under British protection.\r\nNotwithstanding this, however, the new Convention was no sooner\r\nsigned than the scheming was resumed, and before a year had passed a\r\nparty of Transvaal Boers, several of them now holding high official\r\npositions under the Republic, raided the territory of the chiefs in\r\nthe British Protectorate, and even attacked the chief town Mafeking.\r\nThis was followed by a proclamation by President Kruger placing the\r\nterritory under the protection of the Republic. Mr. Rhodes, who had\r\nalready made himself conspicuous by his advocacy of holding the\r\nhighway to the interior open, was instrumental in inducing the\r\nImperial Government to make a determined stand against this. An\r\nultimatum moved the Transvaal Government to withdraw the proclamation\r\nand forced the Boers to leave the country--only, however, when and\r\nbecause the demand was backed by the Warren expedition at a cost of\r\nover a million and a half to the British taxpayer! This expedition\r\nwas sent by Mr. Gladstone, the Boer benefactor--notwithstanding all\r\nhis anxiety to prove the Transvaal settlement a good one! The action\r\nof the Transvaal, and the most brutal murder of Mr. Bethell by the\r\nindividuals above referred to as holding high official positions\r\nunder the Republic, gave indications of the bent of the Boer\r\nauthorities which people in South Africa did not fail to take note\r\nof. Bethell had been wounded in the invasion of the territory by the\r\nBoers, and as he lay helpless the 'prominent Transvaal official' came\r\nup and, seeing a repeating rifle lying beside him, asked him to show\r\nthem how it worked. He did so, and the 'prominent official' taking it\r\nup under pretext of examining it shot Bethell dead with his own\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nIn Zululand similar tactics were resorted to by the Republic.\r\nTransvaal Boers invaded Zululand and (1884) took up the cause of\r\nDinizulu, a son of the dead Cetewayo, and established him as king,\r\nupsetting Sir Garnet Wolseley's settlement. They then proceeded to\r\nseize the country, but the British Government intervening at this\r\npoint, rescued some two-thirds for the Zulus. A glance at the map\r\nwill show that the intention of the Boers was to get to the sea, and\r\nalso that the unlucky Zulus, who had been broken by the British\r\nGovernment--and very rightly too--because they were a menace to the\r\nTransvaal, even more than to Natal, were now deprived of the pick of\r\ntheir country, plundered and harried by the very people who had been\r\nat their mercy until the Imperial Government stepped in. It is very\r\nnoteworthy that, with the splendid exception of the lion-hearted Piet\r\nUys and his sons, who fought and died (father and one son) in the\r\nZulu war side by side with the Britishers whom he was keenly opposing\r\non the annexation question, none of the Boers came forward to help in\r\nthe Secocoeni or Zulu wars, although these wars were undertaken, the\r\none entirely, and the other mainly, on their account. But a great\r\nmany were ready to raid and annex as soon as the Zulu power was\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nSwaziland became in turn the object of the Boer Government's\r\nattentions. First, grazing concessions were obtained; and next, other\r\nconcessions for the collection of Customs and Revenue dues, for\r\ntelegraphs, railways, banking, surveying, and goodness only knows\r\nwhat. One individual applied for and obtained a concession for the\r\nbalance of ungranted concessions, and another applied for a grant of\r\nthe Chief Justiceship. What chance the unfortunate native had in such\r\na condition of things can be imagined. The Transvaal bought up all\r\nthe concessions necessary to make government of the country\r\nabsolutely impossible, except with their cooperation. The secret\r\nservice fund of the Republic provided means for making the\r\nrepresentatives of the Swazi nation see things in a reasonable light,\r\nso that when the time came to investigate the title to concessions\r\nand to arrange for the future administration of the country the\r\nresult was a foregone conclusion. The judge appointed by the Imperial\r\nGovernment on the Special Joint Commission to inquire into the\r\nconcessions and matters in general let some light on the manner in\r\nwhich these concessions were acquired and granted, by pertinent\r\nquestions to the concessionaires and interpreters. He asked, for\r\ninstance, 'Do you swear that you interpreted this document verbatim\r\nto the king?'--'Yes.' 'Will you kindly tell to the Court what is the\r\nor how you interpreted and explained the significance of the\r\n\"survey,\" \"mint,\" \"revenue,\" and \"townships\" concessions?'\r\n\r\nThe picture of the obese and drunken chief surrounded by fawning\r\nharpies was a shameful and disgusting one. One example is sufficient\r\nto show how the thing was done. A concession for gambling was applied\r\nfor. The man who interpreted knew a smattering of 'kitchen' Kaffir,\r\nand his rendering of the 'monopoly for billiards, card playing,\r\nlotteries, and games of chance' was that he alone should be allowed\r\nto '_tchia ma-ball_ (hit the balls), _hlala ma-paper_ (play the\r\npapers), and _tata zonki mali_ (and take all the money).' The poor\r\ndrunken king nodded sleepily to the first two clauses, but to the\r\nbald proposition of taking all the money, which he _could_\r\nunderstand, he violently objected. The concession was, however,\r\nsubsequently granted on the representations of a more tactful\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nA very flagrant breach of the spirit of the London Convention, and a\r\nvery daring attempt at land-grabbing, was the proposed last will and\r\ntestament of the Swazi King Umbandine, which provided that the\r\ngoverning powers should be assigned to Mr. Kruger as executor of the\r\nKing and trustee and administrator of the country. His project was\r\ndefeated; but the aim of the Boer Government was ultimately achieved,\r\nnevertheless, and Swaziland has now been handed over to the control\r\nof the Republic in spite of the prayers and protestations of the\r\nSwazis themselves, who had proved in the past with very practical\r\nresults to be useful, ready, and loyal allies of the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWhile Swaziland was being entoiled the Transvaal Government were not\r\nidle elsewhere. Matabeleland was looked upon as the heritage of the\r\nBoer, because of the 'old friendship' with the Matabele,--whom they\r\nhad driven out of their country, now the Transvaal; and Mashonaland\r\nwas theirs because it was their ancient hunting-ground. That the\r\nBoers did not abandon their old schemes merely because they had\r\nagreed by treaty to do so is shown by a letter which was found at Lo\r\nBengula's kraal by Mr. F. Thompson when he went up to negotiate for\r\nMr. Rhodes. The stealthy grovelling of the Commandant-General before\r\na savage native chief, the unctuous phraseology, the hypocritical\r\nassurances of an undying friendship between Boer and Matabele so long\r\nas there are living one of each race, throw a lurid light upon the\r\nconduct of Boer diplomacy with native tribes, and explain much of the\r\nineradicable fear and distrust which are felt on the native side in\r\nall dealings with the aggressive Boer. The letter reads:\r\n\r\n  MARICO,\r\n  THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC,\r\n  _March 9, 1882._\r\n\r\n_To the great ruler the Chief Lo Bengula, the son of Umzilikatse, the\r\ngreat King of the Matabili nation_.\r\n\r\nGREAT RULER,\r\n\r\nWhen this letter reaches you, then you will know that it comes from a\r\nman who very much desires to visit you, but who, being a man of the\r\npeople, cannot get loose to make such a long journey. Therefore he\r\nmust now be satisfied with writing a letter to carry his regards to\r\nthe son of the late King of the Matabele, our old friend Umzilikatse.\r\nWhen I say that I desire to see you, it is not to ask for anything,\r\nbut to talk of something, and to tell Lo Bengula of the affairs and\r\nthings of the world, because I know that there are many people who\r\ntalk and tell about these matters, whilst there are but few who tell\r\nthe truth. Now, when a man hears a thing wrong, it is worse than if\r\nhe had never heard it at all. Now, I know that Lo Bengula has heard\r\nsome things wrongly, and for this reason would I tell him the real\r\ntruth. Now, you must have heard that the English--or as they are\r\nbetter known the Englishmen--took away our country, the Transvaal,\r\nor, as they say, annexed it. We then talked nicely for four years,\r\nand begged for our country. But no; when an Englishman once has your\r\nproperty in his hand, then is he like a monkey that has its hands\r\nfull of pumpkin-seeds--if you don't beat him to death, he will\r\nnever let go--and then all our nice talk for four years did not help\r\nus at all. Then the English commenced to arrest us because we were\r\ndissatisfied, and that caused the shooting and fighting. Then the\r\nEnglish first found that it would be better to give us back our\r\ncountry. Now they are gone, and our country is free, and we will now\r\nonce more live in friendship with Lo Bengula, as we lived in\r\nfriendship with Umzilikatse, and such must be our friendship, that so\r\nlong as there is one Boer and one Matabele living these two must\r\nremain friends. On this account do I wish to see Lo Bengula, and if I\r\nmay live so long, and the country here become altogether settled, and\r\n_the stink which the English brought_ is first blown away altogether,\r\nthen I will still ride so far to reach Lo Bengula, and if he still\r\nhas this letter then he will hear the words from the mouth of the man\r\nwho now must speak with the pen upon paper, and who, therefore,\r\ncannot so easily tell him everything. The man is a brother's child of\r\nthe three brothers that formerly--now thirty-two years ago--were at\r\nUmzilikatse's, and then made the peace with him which holds to this\r\nday. He still remembers well when the first Boers, Franz Joubert,\r\nJann Joubert, and Pieter Joubert, came there, and when they made the\r\nthe peace which is so strong that the vile evil-doers were never able\r\nto destroy it, and never shall be able to destroy it as long as there\r\nshall be one Boer that lives and Lo Bengula also lives.\r\n\r\nNow I wish to send something to give Lo Bengula a present as a token\r\nof our friendship. I send for Lo Bengula with the gentleman who will\r\nbring him this letter a blanket and a handkerchief for his great\r\nwife, who is the mother of all the Matabele nation. I will one day\r\ncome to see their friendship. The gentleman who brings the letter\r\nwill tell you about all the work which I have to do here. Some bad\r\npeople have incited Kolahing, and so he thought he would make\r\nfortifications and fight with us, but he got frightened, and saw that\r\nhe would be killed, therefore I made him break down the\r\nfortifications and pack all the stones in one heap, and he had then\r\nto pay 5,000 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats for his wickedness. Now\r\nthere is another chief, Gatsizibe--he came upon our land and killed\r\nthree people and plundered them--he must also pay a fine, or else we\r\nwill punish him or shoot him, because we will have peace in our\r\ncountry. Now greetings, great Chief Lo Bengula, from the\r\nCommandant-General of the South African Republic for the Government\r\nand Administration.\r\n\r\n  P.J. JOUBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA big trek (the Banjailand trek) was organized in 1890 and 1891 by\r\nGeneral Joubert and his relatives and supporters to occupy a portion\r\nof the territory already proclaimed as under British protection and\r\nthe administration of the Chartered Company. The trekkers were turned\r\nback at Rhodes's Drift, stopped by the firmness and courage and tact\r\nof Dr. Jameson, who met them alone and unarmed; and also by the\r\nproclamation of President Kruger, to whom it had been plainly\r\nintimated that the invasion would be forcibly resisted and would\r\ninevitably provoke war. The matter had gone so far that the offices\r\nof the Republic of Banjai had already been allotted. The President's\r\nproclamation instead of being regarded as the barest fulfilment of\r\nhis obligations--very grudgingly done under pressure of threats--was\r\nvaunted as an act of supreme magnanimity and generosity, and was used\r\nin the bargaining for the cession of Swaziland.\r\n\r\nIn Tongaland Boer emissaries were not idle; but they failed, owing to\r\nthe fact that the Tonga Queen Regent, Zambili, a really fine specimen\r\nof the savage ruler, would have nothing to do with any power but\r\nEngland, whose suzerainty she accepted in 1887. Being shut off here,\r\nthe Boer Government made another bid for seaward extension, and,\r\nthrough their emissaries, obtained certain rights from two petty\r\nchiefs, Zambaan and Umbegesa, whom they represented as independent\r\nkings; but Lord Rosebery annexed their territories in 1894, and so\r\nput a final stop to the Transvaal schemes to evade the Convention by\r\nintrigue with neighbouring native tribes.\r\n\r\nNothing can better illustrate the Boers' deliberate evasion of their\r\ntreaty obligations than their conduct in these matters. The Pretoria\r\nConvention defined the Transvaal boundaries and acknowledged the\r\nindependence of the Swazis, and yet the British Government's delay in\r\nconsenting to the annexation of Swaziland by the Republic was\r\nregarded for years as an intolerable grievance, and was proclaimed as\r\nsuch so insistently that nearly all South Africa came at last to so\r\nregard it.\r\n\r\nThe Boers' consent to the Chartered Company's occupation of\r\nMashonaland was looked upon as something calling for a _quid pro\r\nquo_, and the annexation of Zambaan's land is now regarded as an\r\ninfamous act of piracy by England, and an infringement of the\r\nRepublic's rights, which the Dutch papers denounce most vehemently.\r\nThe Boer Government made it clear, not less in their purely internal\r\npolicy than in these matters of extensions of territory, that they\r\nintended pursuing a line of their own.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, the property known as 'Moodies,' consisting of a number of\r\nfarms bearing indications of gold, was thrown open to prospectors.\r\nThe farms had been allotted to Mr. G. Piggott Moodie when he was\r\nSurveyor-General, in lieu of salary which the Republic was unable to\r\npay. This was the beginning of the prospecting era which opened up De\r\nKaap, Witwatersrand, and other fields; but it was a small beginning,\r\nand for some time nothing worth mentioning was discovered. The\r\nRepublic was again in a bad way, and drifting backwards after its\r\nfirst spurt. The greatest uncertainty prevailed amongst prospectors\r\nas to their titles, for in Lydenburg, at Pilgrim's Rest, and on the\r\nDevil's Kantoor, concessions had been granted over the heads of the\r\nminers at work on their claims, and they had been turned off for the\r\nbenefit of men who contributed in no way to the welfare and\r\nprosperity of the State. It has been stated in the Volksraad that not\r\none of those concessionaires has even paid the dues and rents, or\r\ncomplied with the other conditions stipulated in the contracts.\r\ndistrict was practically locked up for fourteen years owing to the\r\nconcession policy, and has only lately been partly released from the\r\nbonds of monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Messrs. Kruger and Smit proceeded to Europe to endeavour to\r\nraise funds, which were badly needed, and also to obtain some\r\nmodifications of the Convention. The attempt to raise funds through\r\nthe parties in Holland to whom the railway concession had just been\r\ngranted failed, but the delegates were more fortunate in their other\r\nnegotiations. They negotiated the London Convention which fixed\r\ncertain hitherto undefined boundaries; and in that document no\r\nreference was made to the suzerainty of Great Britain. They also\r\nsecured the consent of the British Government to the alteration of\r\nthe title of the country. Instead of Transvaal State it became once\r\nmore the 'South African Republic.'{07} During this visit there\r\noccurred an incident which provides the answer to Mr. Kruger's\r\noft--_too_ oft--repeated remark that 'the Uitlanders were never asked\r\nto settle in the Transvaal, and are not wanted there.' Messrs. Kruger\r\nand Smit were staying at the Albemarle Hotel, where they found\r\nthemselves, after some weeks' delay, in the uncomfortable position of\r\nbeing unable to pay their hotel bill. In their extremity they applied\r\nto one Baron Grant, at that time a bright particular star in the\r\nStock Exchange firmament. Baron Grant was largely interested in the\r\ngold concessions of Lydenburg, and he was willing to assist, but on\r\nterms. And the _quid pro quo_ which he asked was some public\r\nassurance of goodwill, protection, and encouragement to British\r\nsettlers in the Transvaal. Mr. Kruger responded on behalf of the\r\nRepublic by publishing in the London press the cordial invitation\r\nand welcome and the promise of rights and protection to all who\r\nwould come, so frequently quoted against him of late.\r\n\r\nBy this time Moodies had attracted a fair number of people, and the\r\nprospects of the country began, for the first time with some show of\r\nreason, to look brighter. No results were felt, however, and the\r\ncondition of the Government officials was deplorable. Smuggling was\r\ncarried on systematically; in many cases officials 'stood in' with\r\nsmugglers. They were obliged either to do that or to enforce the laws\r\nproperly and get what they could by seizing contraband goods. There\r\nwere two objections to the latter course, however. One was that the\r\ncountry was large and detection difficult with men who were both\r\ndaring and resourceful; and the other was that the officials were not\r\nsure of receiving their share of the spoil from a Government so hard\r\npressed as this one was, and whose higher officials also had\r\ndifficulties about payment of salaries. In many cases salaries were\r\nsix months in arrear; and other cases could be quoted of officials\r\nwhose house-rent alone amounted to more than their nominal\r\nremuneration. Yet they continued to live, and it was not difficult to\r\nsurmise _how_. Another significant fact was that goods subject to\r\nheavy duties--such as spirits, hams, etc.--could be bought at any\r\nstore at a price which was less than original cost plus carriage and\r\nduty. Smuggling was a very palpable fact, and--quoth the public and\r\nthe officials--a very convenient and even necessary evil.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the Customs officials conducted the business\r\nof their office was observed by other officials of the Republic, and\r\nin one department, at least, the abuses have had a very far-reaching\r\nand serious effect. The Field-cornets--district officials who act as\r\npetty justices, registering, and pass officers, collectors of\r\npersonal taxes, captains of the burgher forces, etc., etc.--are the\r\nofficers with whom each newcomer has to register. This is an\r\nimportant matter, because the period of residence for the purpose of\r\nnaturalization and enfranchisement is reckoned from the date of\r\nregistration in the Field-cornet's books. As these officials were\r\npractically turned loose on the public to make a living the best\r\nway they could, many of them, notwithstanding that they collected the\r\ntaxes imposed by law, omitted to enter the names of new arrivals in\r\ntheir books, thus securing themselves against having to make good\r\nthese amounts in event of an inspection of the books. Many of the\r\nField-cornets were barely able to write; they had no 'offices,' and\r\nwould accept taxes and registrations at any time and in any place.\r\nThe chances of correct entry were therefore remote. The result of\r\nthis is very serious. The records are either 'lost' when they might\r\nprove embarrassing, or so incorrectly or imperfectly kept as to be of\r\nno use whatever; and settlers in the Transvaal from 1882 to 1890 are\r\nin most cases unable to prove their registration as the law requires,\r\nand this through no fault of their own.\r\n\r\nIn the country districts justice was not a commodity intended for the\r\nBritisher. Many cases of gross abuse, and several of actual murder\r\noccurred; and in 1885 the case of Mr. Jas. Donaldson, then residing\r\non a farm in Lydenburg--lately one of the Reform prisoners--was\r\nmentioned in the House of Commons, and became the subject of a demand\r\nby the Imperial Government for reparation and punishment. He had been\r\nordered by two Boers (one of whom was in the habit of boasting that\r\nhe had shot an unarmed Englishman in Lydenburg since the war, and\r\nwould shoot others) to abstain from collecting hut taxes on his own\r\nfarm; and on refusing had been attacked by them. After beating them\r\noff single-handed, he was later on again attacked by his former\r\nassailants, reinforced by three others. They bound him with reims\r\n(thongs), kicked and beat him with sjamboks (raw-hide whips) and\r\nclubs, stoned him, and left him unconscious and so disfigured that he\r\nwas thought to be dead when found some hours later. On receipt of the\r\nImperial Government's representations, the men were arrested, tried\r\nand fined. The fines were stated to have been remitted at once by\r\nGovernment, but in the civil action which followed Mr. Donaldson\r\nobtained £500 damages. The incident had a distinctly beneficial\r\neffect, and nothing more was heard of the maltreatment of defenceless\r\nmen simply because they were Britishers. Moreover, with the\r\nimprovement in trade which followed the gold discoveries of 1885\r\nand 1886 at Moodies and Barberton, the relations between the two\r\nraces also improved. Frequent intercourse and commercial relations\r\nbegot a better knowledge of each other, and the fierce hatred of the\r\nBritisher began to disappear in the neighbourhood of the towns and\r\nthe goldfields.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the wonderful richness of the Sheba Mine in Barberton\r\nattracted a good deal of attention, and drew a large number of\r\npersons--prospectors, speculators, traders, etc.--to the Transvaal.\r\nBefore the end of 1887 ten or twelve thousand must have poured into\r\nthe country. The effect was magical. The revenue which had already\r\nincreased by 50 per cent. in 1886, doubled itself in 1887, and then\r\nthere came unto the Boer Government that which they had least\r\nexpected--ample means to pursue their greater ambitions. But unmixed\r\ngood comes to few, and with the blessings of plenty came the cares of\r\nGovernment, the problem of dealing with people whose habits,\r\nthoughts, ambitions, methods, language, and logic differed utterly\r\nfrom their own. Father Abraham on the London Stock Exchange would not\r\nbe much more 'at sea' than the peasant farmers of the Volksraad were\r\nin dealing with the requirements of the new settlers.\r\n\r\nAgitations for reforms commenced early in Barberton. At first it was\r\nonly roads and bridges that were wanted, or the remission of certain\r\ntaxes, or security of title for stands and claims. Later on a\r\npolitical association named the Transvaal Republican Union was formed\r\nin Barberton, having a constitution and programme much the same as\r\nthose of the Transvaal National Union, formed some five years later\r\nin Johannesburg. The work of this body was looked on with much\r\ndisfavour by the Government, and it was intimated to some of the\r\nprominent members that if they did not cease to concern themselves\r\nwith politics they would suffer in their business relations, and\r\nmight even be called upon to leave the country. Many reforms were\r\nspecified as desirable, and the franchise question was raised, with\r\nthe object of getting the Government to make some reasonable\r\nprovision in lieu of the registration clause, which was found in most\r\ncases to be an absolute bar.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Witwatersrand conglomerate formation soon\r\nhelped to swell the flowing tide of prosperity. In the middle of\r\n1887 the regular output of gold commenced, and the fields have never\r\n'looked back' since. Johannesburg--named after Mr. Johannes Rissik,\r\nthe Surveyor-General of the Transvaal--was soon a far greater problem\r\nthan Barberton had been. The shareholders in the mines soon found it\r\nnecessary to have some organization to protect their interests and\r\ngive unison to their policy, and to preserve the records and collect\r\ninformation for the industry. The Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines was\r\nthen formed, a voluntary business association of unique interest and\r\nefficiency. The organization includes all the representative and\r\ninfluential men, and every company of any consequence connected with\r\nthe mining industry; and it has, through its committee and officials,\r\nfor eight years represented to the Volksraad the existence of abuses\r\nand grievances, the remedies that are required, and the measures\r\nwhich are felt to be necessary or conducive to the progress of the\r\nindustry in particular, or the welfare of the State in general. The\r\nPresident, Executive and Volksraad, by neglect of their obvious\r\nduties, by their ignorance of ordinary public affairs, by their\r\nwilful disregard of the requirements of the Uitlanders, have given\r\ncohesion to a people about as heterogeneous as any community under\r\nthe sun, and have trained them to act and to care for themselves. The\r\nrefusal year after year to give a charter of incorporation to the\r\nChamber, on the grounds that it would be creating an _imperium in\r\nimperio_, and the comments of Volksraad members on the petition, have\r\nmade it clear that the Government view the Chamber with no friendly\r\neye. The facts that in order to get a workable pass law at all the\r\nChamber had to prepare it in every detail, together with plans for\r\nthe creation and working of a Government department; and that in\r\norder to diminish the litigation under the gold law, and to make that\r\nfearful and wonderful agglomeration of erratic, experimental, crude,\r\ninvolved, contradictory and truly incomprehensible enactments at all\r\nunderstandable, the Chamber had to codify it at its own expense and\r\non its own initiative, illustrate both the indispensable character of\r\nthe organization, and the ignorance and ineptitude of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Volksraad for the last ten years may be searched\r\nin vain for any measure calculated constructively to advance the\r\ncountry, or to better the conditions of the workers in it, with the\r\nfew--very few--exceptions of those proposed by the Chamber of Mines.\r\nThe country has, in fact, run the Government, and the Government has\r\nbeen unable to ruin it.\r\n\r\nShortly after the discovery of the Rand conglomerates, it became\r\nclear that a railway would have to be built between the coalfields\r\nand the mines--some forty miles. But it was a fixed principle of the\r\nBoers that no railways (with the exception of the Delagoa Bay line,\r\nwhich, as the means of diverting trade from British channels, was\r\nregarded as a necessary evil) should be built, since they could\r\ncompete successfully with the ox-waggon, and thus deprive the 'poor\r\nburgher' of his legitimate trade spoil; and great difficulty was\r\nexperienced in getting the consent of the Raad. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe permission to build it was only obtained by subterfuge; for it\r\nwas explained to the worthy law-makers that it was not a railway at\r\nall--only a _steam tram_. And the Rand Steam Tram it is called to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nThe Delagoa Railway--the darling scheme of Presidents Burgers and\r\nKruger in turn--was taken seriously in hand as soon as it was\r\npossible to raise money on almost any terms. The concession for all\r\nrailways in the State was granted on April 16, 1884, to a group of\r\nHollander and German capitalists, and confirmed by the Volksraad on\r\nAugust 23 following. The President's excuse for granting and\r\npreserving this iniquitous bond on the prosperity of the State is,\r\nthat when the country was poor and its credit bad, friends in Holland\r\ncame forward and generously helped it, and this must not be forgotten\r\nto them. As a matter of fact, friends accepted the concession when\r\nthe State was poor and its credit bad, but did nothing until the\r\nState's credit improved to such an extent as to be mortgageable.\r\n_Then_ the friends granted certain favourable terms under their\r\nconcession to other friends, who built the first section of the line\r\nat preposterous rates, and repaid themselves out of moneys raised on\r\nthe State's credit.\r\n\r\nA well-known South African politician, distinguished alike for his\r\nability and integrity, who visited the Transvaal during the progress\r\nof the reformers' trial, and was anxious in the interests of all\r\nSouth Africa to find a solution of the differences, put the position\r\nthus to some of the leading men of the Rand: 'You can see for\r\nyourselves that this is no time to ask for the franchise; for the\r\ntime being, Jameson's invasion has made such a suggestion impossible.\r\nNow, tell me in a word, Is there any one thing that you require more\r\nthan anything else, which we can help you to get?' The answer was:\r\n'The one thing which we must have--not for its own sake, but for the\r\nsecurity it offers for obtaining and retaining other reforms--_is_\r\nthe franchise. No promise of reform, no reform itself, will be worth\r\nan hour's purchase unless we have the status of voters to make our\r\ninfluence felt. But, if you want the chief economic grievances, they\r\nare: the Netherlands Railway Concession, the dynamite monopoly, the\r\nliquor traffic, and native labour, which, together, constitute an\r\nunwarrantable burden of indirect taxation on the industry of _over\r\ntwo and a half millions sterling annually_. We petitioned until we\r\nwere jeered at; we agitated until we--well--came here [Pretoria\r\nGaol]; and we know that we shall get no remedy until we have the vote\r\nto enforce it. We are not a political but a working community, and if\r\nwe were honestly and capably governed the majority of us would be\r\ncontent to wait for the franchise for a considerable time yet in\r\nrecognition of the peculiar circumstances, and of the feelings of the\r\nolder inhabitants. That is the position in a nutshell.'\r\n\r\n[Netherlands Railway Company.]\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands Railway Company is then a very important factor. It\r\nis unnecessary to go very fully into its history and the details of\r\nits administration. As the holder of an absolute monopoly, as the\r\nenterprise which has involved the State in its National Debt, and as\r\nthe sole channel through which such money has been expended, the\r\nCompany has gradually worked itself into the position of being the\r\nfinancial department of the State; and the functions which are\r\nelsewhere exercised by the heads of the Government belong here, in\r\npractice, entirely to this foreign corporation. Petitions for the\r\ncancellation of this concession were presented in 1888, when the\r\nprogressive element in the first Volksraad consisted of one man--Mr.\r\nLoveday, one of the loyalists in the war. The agitation begun and\r\ncarried on by him was taken up by others, but without further result\r\nthan that of compelling the President to show his hand and step\r\nforward as the champion of the monopoly on every occasion on which it\r\nwas assailed. During the years 1893-96 the President stoutly defended\r\nthe Company in the Volksraad, and by his influence and the solid vote\r\nof his ignorant Dopper Party completely blocked all legislation\r\ntending to control the Company. Indeed at the end of the Session of\r\n1895, on receiving representations from the business communities of\r\nthe Republic as to the desirability of removing this incubus from the\r\novertaxed people, the President stated plainly that the Netherlands\r\nRailway Concession was a matter of high politics and did not concern\r\nany but the burghers of the State, and that he would receive no\r\nrepresentations from the Uitlanders on the subject nor would he\r\npermit them to discuss it.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after the granting of this railway concession came the\r\nappointment of Dr. Leyds as State Attorney for the Republic, he\r\nhaving been recommended and pushed forward by the gentlemen in\r\nHolland to whom the concession had been granted. It is stated that he\r\nwas sent out as the agent of the concessionaires in order to protect\r\nand advance their interests, although at the same time in the service\r\nof the Republic. It is only necessary to add that Mr. Beelaerts van\r\nBlokland, the Consul-General for the Republic in Holland, is the\r\nagent of the concessionaires in that country, and the accord with\r\nwhich these two gentlemen, as railway commissioners at their\r\nrespective ends, have always acted becomes intelligible. Several of\r\nthe vital conditions of the concession have been freely violated, the\r\nfirst being that a certain section of the line (Nelspruit) should be\r\ncompleted within four years. It was not completed for eight. The\r\nconcession really became void several times during the years prior to\r\n1890, but always found a stalwart champion in the President, who\r\ncontinued to defend the concessionaires for some two years after they\r\nhad failed to get their capital subscribed. The Company was\r\nfloated on June 21 1887 on the most peculiar terms, the capital of\r\n£166,666 being in 2,000 shares of 1,000 guilders, or £83 6s. 8d.\r\neach. The shares were subscribed for by the following groups:\r\n\r\n  German            819 shares, carrying 30 votes.\r\n  Hollander         581    \"        \"    76   \"\r\n  The Republic      600    \"        \"     6   \"\r\n\r\nThe trust-deed, which limited the Republic to 6 out of 112 votes,\r\nalthough it subscribed about one-third of the capital, and gave to\r\nthe smallest holders, the Hollanders, twice as many votes as all the\r\nothers put together, was passed by Dr. Leyds, in his capacity of\r\nlegal adviser of the Government, having previously been prepared by\r\nhim in his other capacity. The sum of £124,000 appears to have been\r\nexpended on construction ten months before any contract was given out\r\nfor the same or any work begun, and fifteen months before any\r\nmaterial was shipped.\r\n\r\nThe contract for the construction of the first sixty miles compels\r\nadmiration, if only for its impudence. In the first place the\r\ncontractors, Van Hattum and Co., were to build the line at a cost to\r\nbe mutually agreed upon by them and the railway company, and they\r\nwere to receive as remuneration 11 per cent. upon the amount of the\r\nspecification. But should they exceed the contract price then the 11\r\nper cent. was to be proportionately decreased by an arranged sliding\r\nscale, provided, however, that Van Hattum and Co. did not _exceed the\r\nspecification by more than 100 per cent._, in which latter case the\r\nCompany would have the right to cancel the contract. By this\r\nprovision Messrs. Van Hattum and Co. could increase the cost by 100\r\nper cent, provided they were willing to lose the 11 per cent. profit,\r\nleaving them a net gain of 89 per cent. They did not neglect the\r\nopportunity. Whole sections of earthworks cost £23,500 per mile,\r\nwhich should not have cost £8,000. Close upon a thousand Hollanders\r\nwere brought out from Holland to work for a few months in each year\r\non the line and then be sent back to Holland again at the expense of\r\nthe Republic. In a country which abounded in stone the Komati Bridge\r\nwas built of dressed stone which had been quarried and worked in\r\nHolland and exported some 7,000 miles by ship and rail.\r\n\r\nThese are a few instances out of many. The loss to the country\r\nthrough the financing was of course far greater than any manipulation\r\nof the construction could bring about. In the creating of overdrafts\r\nand the raising of loans very large sums indeed were handled.\r\nThree-quarters of a million in one case and a million in another\r\noffered opportunities which the Hollander-German gentlemen who were\r\ndoing business for the country out of love for it (as was frequently\r\nurged on their behalf in the Volksraad) were quick to perceive. The 5\r\nper cent. debentures issued to raise the latter sum were sold at £95\r\n15s.; but the financiers deducted £5 commission from even this, so\r\nthat the State has only benefited to the extent of £90 15s. This\r\ntransaction was effected at a time when the State loan known as the\r\nTransvaal Fives--raised on exactly the same interest and precisely\r\nthe same guarantee--was quoted at over par. What, however, was felt\r\nto be worse than any detail of finance was that this corporation of\r\nforeigners had gradually obtained complete control of the finances of\r\nthe State, and through the railway system it practically dictated the\r\nrelations with the other Governments in South Africa, by such\r\nmeasures for instance as the imposition of a charge of 8-1/2d. per\r\nton per mile on goods travelling over their lines coming from the\r\nCape Colony, whilst the other lines are favoured by a charge of less\r\nthan half that. The burdens placed upon the mining industry by the\r\nexcessive charges imposed for political purposes were, in the case of\r\nthe poorer mines, ruinous. The right which the Company had to collect\r\nthe Customs dues for account of the State, to retain them as security\r\nfor the payment of interest on their shares and debentures, and to\r\nimpose a charge for collection quite disproportionate to the cost,\r\nwas another serious grievance. It was hopeless, however, to deal with\r\nthe whole question. The Government had set its face against any\r\nreform in this quarter. It was not possible to obtain even ordinary\r\nworking facilities such as any business corporation unprotected by an\r\nabsolute monopoly would be bound to concede of its own accord, in\r\norder to catch a measure of trade.\r\n\r\nThe Government have the right, under the agreement with the\r\nCompany, to take over the railway on certain conditions, of which\r\nthe following are the most important:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Company shall receive one year's notice of the intention to\r\ntake over.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Company shall receive twenty times the amount of the\r\naverage of the last three years' dividends.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Company shall receive as a solatium for the unexpired\r\nperiod of the concession an amount equal to one per cent. of its\r\nnominal capital for each year up to the year of expiring (1915).\r\n\r\nThe Government can take over the Krugersdorp-Johannesburg-Boksburg\r\nTramway against payment of the cost of construction.\r\n\r\nIf the Volksraad should not during this Session{08} decide to\r\nnationalize the railway no change can take place before 1898, so that\r\nthe three years 1895 to 1897 would have to be taken as a basis and\r\ntherefore the 6 per cent. for 1894, the only low dividend, would not\r\ncome into the calculation. This would of course considerably increase\r\nthe purchase price--_e.g._,\r\n\r\n  1895              9 per cent.\r\n  1896             14      \"    (estimate),\r\n  1897             14      \"         \"\r\n                   --\r\n          Total    37      \"\r\n\r\nThat is to say an average distribution of 12.33 per cent. for the\r\nthree years. The purchase price would thus be:\r\n\r\n                    12.33 X 20 = 246.66 per cent.\r\n  17 years' premium               17       \"\r\n                                 ------\r\n                 Total           263.66    \"\r\n\r\nThis has been clearly explained to the Volksraad but without avail,\r\nthe President's influence on the other side being too strong. During\r\nthe Session of 1895 it was made clear that agitation against the\r\nCompany was as futile as beating the air. When the Hollander clique\r\nfound that they could no longer convince the Boers as a whole of the\r\nsoundness of their business and the genuineness of their aims, and\r\nwhen they failed to combat the arguments and exposures of their\r\ncritics, they resorted to other tactics, and promulgated voluminous\r\nreports and statements of explanations which left the unfortunate\r\nVolksraad members absolutely stupefied where they had formerly only\r\nbeen confused.{09}\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from an article in the Johannesburg _Mining\r\nJournal_, dealing with the burdens imposed by the railway company\r\nupon the industry:\r\n\r\nRAILWAY MONOPOLY.\r\n\r\nThis is another carefully designed burden upon the mines and country.\r\nThe issued capital and loans of the Netherlands Company now total\r\nabout £7,000,000, upon which an average interest of about 5-1/3 per\r\ncent.--guaranteed by the State--is paid, equal to £370,000 per annum.\r\nNaturally the bonds are at a high premium. The Company and its\r\nliabilities can be taken over by the State at a year's notice, and\r\nthe necessary funds for this purpose can be raised at 3 per cent. An\r\noffer was recently made to the Government to consolidate this and\r\nother liabilities, but the National Bank, which is another\r\nconcession, has the monopoly of all State loan business, and this\r\ncircumstance effectually disposed of the proposal. At 3 per cent. a\r\nsaving of £160,000 per annum would be made in this monopoly in\r\ninterest alone. The value represented by the Custom dues on the\r\nPortuguese border we are not in a position to estimate, but roughly\r\nthese collections and the 15 per cent. of the profits paid to the\r\nmanagement and shareholders must, with other leakages, represent at\r\nleast another £100,000 per annum, which should be saved the country.\r\nAs the revenue of the corporation now exceeds £2,000,000 a year, of\r\nwhich only half is expended in working costs, the estimate we have\r\ntaken does not err upon the side of extravagance. By its neglect of\r\nits duties towards the commercial and mining community enormous\r\nlosses are involved. Thus, in the coal traffic, the rate--which is\r\nnow to be somewhat reduced--has been 3d. per ton per mile. According\r\nto the returns of the Chamber of Mines, the coal production of the\r\nTransvaal for 1895 was 1,045,121 tons. This is carried an average\r\ndistance of nearly thirty miles, but taking the distance at\r\ntwenty-four miles the charges are 6s. per ton. At 1-1/2d. per ton per\r\nmile--three times as much as the Cape railways charge--a saving upon\r\nthe coal rates of 3s. per ton would follow, equal to £150,000 per\r\nannum. Again, by the 'bagging' system, an additional cost of 2s. 3d.\r\nper ton is incurred--details of this item have been recently\r\npublished in this paper--and if this monopoly were run upon ordinary\r\nbusiness lines, a further saving of £110,000 would be made by\r\ncarrying coal in bulk. The interest upon the amount required to\r\nconstruct the necessary sidings for handling the coal, and the\r\ntram-lines required to transport it to the mines, would be a mere\r\nfraction upon this amount; and as the coal trade in the course of a\r\nshort time is likely to see a 50 per cent. increase, the estimate may\r\nbe allowed to stand at this figure without deduction. No data are\r\navailable to fix the amount of the tax laid upon the people generally\r\nby the vexatious delays and losses following upon inefficient railway\r\nadministration, but the monthly meetings of the local Chamber of\r\nCommerce throw some light upon these phases of a monopolistic\r\nmanagement. The savings to be made in dealing with the coal traffic\r\nmust not be taken as exhausting all possible reforms; the particulars\r\ngiven as to this traffic only indicate and suggest the wide area\r\ncovered by this monopoly, which hitherto has made but halting and\r\nfeeble efforts to keep pace with the requirements of the public.\r\nDealing as it does with the imports of the whole country, which now\r\namount in value to £10,000,000, the figures we have given must serve\r\nmerely to illustrate its invertebrate methods of handling traffic, as\r\nwell as its grasping greed in enforcing the rates fixed by the terms\r\nof its concession. Its forty miles of Rand steam tram-line and\r\nthirty-five miles of railway from the Vaal River, with some little\r\nassistance from the Delagoa line and Customs, brought in a revenue\r\nof about £1,250,000 in 1895. Now that the Natal line is opened the\r\nreceipts will probably amount to nearly £3,000,000 per annum, all of\r\nwhich should swell the ordinary revenue of the country, instead of\r\nremaining in the hands of foreigners as a reservoir of wealth for\r\nindigent Hollanders to exploit. The total railway earnings of the\r\nCape and Natal together over all their lines amounted to £3,916,566\r\nin 1895, and the capital expenditure on railways by these colonies\r\namounts to £26,000,000. The greater portion of these receipts come\r\nfrom the Rand trade, which is compelled to pay an additional\r\n£2,500,000, carrying charges to the Netherlands Company, which has\r\n£7,000,000 of capital. Thus, railway receipts in South Africa amount\r\nnow to £7,000,000 per annum, of which the Rand contributes at least\r\n£5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the company is now considerably over £3,000,000 per\r\nannum. The management claim that their expenses amount to but 40 per\r\ncent. of revenue, and this is regarded by them as a matter for\r\ngeneral congratulation. The Uitlanders contend that the concern is\r\ngrossly _mis_managed, and that the low cost of working is a fiction.\r\nIt only appears low by contrast with a revenue swollen by\r\npreposterously heavy rates and protected by a monopoly. The tariff\r\ncould be reduced by one-half; that is to say, a remission of taxation\r\nto the tune of one and a half million annually could be effected\r\nwithout depriving the Company of a legitimate and indeed very\r\nhandsome profit.\r\n\r\n[Selati Railway.]\r\n\r\nThe Selati Railway Scheme! 'Conceived in iniquity, delivered in\r\nshame, died in disgrace!' might be its history, but for the fact that\r\nit is not quite dead yet. But very nearly! The concession was\r\nobtained during the Session of 1890 by a member of the First\r\nVolksraad, Mr. Barend J. Vorster, jun., who himself took part in and\r\nguided the tone of the debate which decided the granting of the\r\nconcession. The Raad resolved to endeavour to obtain the favourable\r\nopinions of their constituents, but before doing so the generous\r\nMr. Vorster made what he was pleased to call 'presents' to the\r\nmembers--American spiders, Cape carts, gold watches, shares in the\r\nCompany to be floated, and sums in cash--were the trifles by which\r\nMr. Vorster won his way to favour. He placated the President by\r\npresenting to the Volksraad a portrait of his Honour, executed by the\r\nlate Mr. Schroeder, South Africa's one artist. The picture cost £600.\r\nThe affair was a notorious and shameless matter of bribery and the\r\nonly profit which the country gained from it was a candid confession\r\nof personal principles on the part of Mr. Kruger himself, who when\r\nthe exposure took place stated that he saw no harm in members\r\nreceiving presents. Debentures to the amount of £500,000 were issued,\r\nbearing Government guarantee of 4 per cent. The Company received £70\r\nfor each £100 debenture. Comment is superfluous. A second issue of a\r\nmillion was made, nominally at £93 10s., but the Company only\r\nreceived £86--a commission to the brokers or agents of 8-3/4 per\r\ncent., at a time when the Company's previous issue of 4 per cents.\r\nwere standing at £97 in the market. The costs of flotation were\r\ncharged at upwards of £32,000; the expenses of one gentleman's\r\ntravelling, etc., £6,000.\r\n\r\nBut these are 'trifles light as air.' This Selati Railway Company,\r\nwhich being guaranteed by Government is really a Government\r\nliability, arranged with a contractor to build the line at the\r\nmaximum cost allowed in the concession, £9,600 per mile. Two days\r\nlater this contractor sub-let the contract for £7,002 per mile. As\r\nthe distance is 200 miles, the Republic was robbed by a stroke of the\r\npen of £519,600--one of the biggest 'steals' even in the Transvaal.\r\nDuring the two years for which Dr. Leyds was responsible as the\r\nrepresentative of the Republic for the management of this affair,\r\nnone of these peculiar transactions were detected--at any rate none\r\nwere reported or exposed; but on the accession to office of an\r\nignorant old Boer the nest of swindles appears to have been\r\ndiscovered without any difficulty. And it is generally admitted that\r\nDr. Leyds is not a fool. This exposure took place at the end of the\r\nSession of 1894, and, inured as the Uitlanders had become to jobs,\r\nthis was an eyeopener even for them, and the startled community\r\ntax-payers--who had to bear the brunt of it all.\r\n\r\n[Revenue.]\r\n\r\nTurning to the finances of the country, the following tables are as\r\ninstructive as anything can be:\r\n\r\nREVENUE AND EXPENDITURE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC.{10}\r\n\r\n           Fiscal period.

This concession was granted shortly\r\nafter the Barberton Fields were discovered, when the prospects of an\r\nindustry in the manufacture of explosives were not really very great.\r\nThe concessionaire himself has admitted that had he foreseen to what\r\nproportions this monopoly would eventually grow he would not have had\r\nthe audacity to apply for it. This, of course, is merely a personal\r\nquestion. The fact which concerned the industry was that the right\r\nwas granted to one man to manufacture explosives and to sell them at\r\na price nearly 200 per cent. over that at which they could be\r\nimported. It was found upon investigation after some years of\r\nagitation that the factory at which this 'manufacture' took place was\r\nin reality merely a depot in which the already manufactured article\r\nwas manipulated to a moderate extent so as to lend colour to the\r\nPresident's statement that a local industry was being fostered. An\r\ninvestigation held by order of the Volksraad exposed the imposition.\r\nThe President himself stated that he found he had been deceived and\r\nthat the terms of the concession had been broken, and he urged the\r\nRaad to cancel it--which the Raad did. The triumph was considerable\r\nfor the mining industry and it was the more appreciated in that it\r\nwas the solitary success to which the Uitlanders could point in their\r\nlong series of agitations for reform. But the triumph was not\r\ndestined to be a lasting one. Within a few months the monopoly was\r\nrevived in an infinitely more obnoxious form. It was now called a\r\nGovernment monopoly, but 'the agency' was bestowed upon a partner of\r\nthe gentleman who had formerly owned the concession, the President\r\nhimself vigorously defending this course and ignoring his own\r\njudgment on the case uttered a few months previously. _Land en Volk_,\r\nthe Pretoria Dutch newspaper, exposed the whole of this transaction,\r\nincluding the system of bribery by which the concessionaries secured\r\ntheir renewal, and among other things made the charge which it has\r\ncontinued to repeat ever since that Mr. J.M.A. Wolmarans, member\r\nof the Executive, received a commission of one shilling per case\r\non every case sold during the continuance of the agency as a\r\nconsideration for his support in the Executive Council, and that he\r\ncontinues to enjoy this remuneration, which is estimated now to be\r\nnot far short of £10,000 a year. Mr. Wolmarans, for reasons of pride\r\nor discretion, has declined to take any notice of the charge,\r\nalthough frequently pressed to take action in the matter. It is\r\ncalculated that the burden imposed upon the Witwatersrand Mines alone\r\namounts to £600,000 per annum, and is, of course, daily increasing.\r\n\r\n[The Franchise Laws.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the franchise, which has achieved the greatest\r\nprominence in the Uitlander agitation, is one with which few people\r\neven in the Transvaal are familiar, so many and peculiar have been\r\nthe changes effected in the law. Lawyers differ as to whether certain\r\nlaws revoke or merely supplement previous ones, and the President\r\nhimself--to the grim amusement of the Uitlanders--frequently goes\r\nastray when he speaks on franchise. The first law on burgher and\r\nelectoral rights is No. 1 of 1876, which remained in force until\r\n1882. By it the possession of landed property or else residence for\r\none year qualified the settler for full burgher privileges. Law No. 7\r\nof 1882 was the first attempt of the restored Republic to deal with\r\nthe question. It was then enacted that an alien could be naturalized\r\nand enfranchised after five years' residence, such residence to be\r\nproved by the Field-cornet's books of registration. It has already\r\nbeen explained that these records in nine cases out of ten were\r\neither improperly kept or non-existent.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Law No. 4 was passed, creating the Second Volksraad and\r\naltering the Grondwet (or constitution) accordingly. By this law the\r\nfranchise was indirectly altered without repealing those portions\r\nwhich may be at variance with or repugnant to the implied\r\nalterations, and this was done by simply defining what class of\r\nelectors should vote for members of the First Raad, and what class\r\nfor members of the Second. Thus, 'the members of the First Volksraad\r\nshall be elected by those enfranchised burghers who have obtained the\r\nright of voting before this law comes in force, or thereafter by\r\nbirth in the State, and on having attained the age of sixteen years.'\r\nSecondly, all those who became naturalized and enfranchised after\r\nthis law was passed could not vote for members of the First\r\nVolksraad, but a subsequent article in the law provides that the\r\nhigher rights can be obtained by those who shall have been eligible\r\nfor ten years for election to the Second Volksraad; and it is then\r\nexplained that, in order to be eligible for the Second Volksraad,\r\nit is necessary to be thirty years of age, to be a member of the\r\nProtestant Church, to live and have landed property in the Republic,\r\nand to have been a naturalized subject for two years. Thus the full\r\nelectoral privileges were only obtainable after fourteen years'\r\nresidence in the State, and the possession of the other\r\nqualifications of religion, property, etc.\r\n\r\nNext came Law No. 13 of 1891, which was rather a codification than an\r\nalteration of previous laws. In 1892 another law was passed again\r\nexplaining, but not materially altering the franchise. In 1893 Law\r\nNo. 14 was passed as an amendment of previous laws: further juggling\r\nthe position--further hedging in the sacred preserve. As the law was\r\nsuperseded in the following year it is unnecessary to go into\r\ndetails; but note how the measure became law! It was not published in\r\nthe _Staats Courant_ for three months as required by law; it was not\r\npublished at all; nor was any special resolution taken affirming that\r\nit was a matter of extreme urgency and therefore to be held exempt\r\nfrom that rule of procedure; so that the High Court ought to be able\r\nto declare it null and void. The circumstances of its introduction\r\ncould not be considered to warrant the plea of urgency. On the 29th\r\nand 30th June, 1893, memorials upon the franchise question were laid\r\nbefore the Raad. From Johannesburg came one memorial bearing 4,507\r\nsignatures out of the grand total of 6,665 memorialists. It was in\r\nfavour of _extension_ of the franchise. Another memorial from 103\r\nFree State burghers was in favour of _extension_, another from\r\nBarberton from 40 burghers also for _extension_. Seven memorials,\r\nbearing 444 signatures, were _against_ extension. All the others\r\nconcerned minor alterations in Law 13 of 1891, and did not affect\r\nthe franchise. The Raad appointed a commission and on the 8th of\r\nSeptember received its report, together with a draft law which had\r\nnot before seen the light of day. After a discussion lasting part of\r\none morning the law was passed provisionally; and to be of full force\r\nand effect until confirmed by the Raad in the following year. Thus\r\nagain were the fundamental political conditions entirely altered by\r\nthe passing of a law which _two hours before_ had not been heard of.\r\n\r\nLaw No. 3 of 1894 purports to supersede all other laws. Therein it is\r\nlaid down that all persons born in the State, or who may have\r\nestablished their domicile therein before May 29, 1876, are entitled\r\nto full political privileges. Those who have settled in the country\r\nsince then can become naturalized after two years' residence dating\r\nfrom the time at which their names were registered in the\r\nField-cornet's books. This naturalization confers the privilege of\r\nvoting for local officials, Field-cornets, landdrosts,{11} and for\r\nmembers of the Second Raad. It is however stipulated that children\r\nborn in the country shall take the status of their fathers. The\r\nnaturalized subject after having been qualified to vote in this\r\nmanner for two years becomes eligible for a seat in the Second\r\nVolksraad--_i.e._, four years after the registration of his name in\r\nthe Field-cornet's books. After he shall have been qualified to sit\r\nin the Second Volksraad for ten years (one of the conditions for\r\nwhich is that he must be thirty years of age) he may obtain the full\r\nburgher rights or political privileges, provided the majority of\r\nburghers in his Ward will signify _in writing their desire that he\r\nshould obtain them_ and provided the President and Executive shall\r\nsee no objection to granting the same. It is thus clear that,\r\nassuming the Field-cornet's records to be honestly and properly\r\ncompiled and to be available for reference (which they are not), the\r\nimmigrant, after fourteen years' probation during which he shall\r\nhave given up his own country and have been politically emasculated,\r\nprivilege of obtaining burgher rights should he be willing and able\r\nto induce the majority of a hostile clique to petition in writing on\r\nhis behalf and should he then escape the veto of the President and\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nThis was the coping-stone to Mr. Kruger's Chinese wall. The\r\nUitlanders and their children were disfranchised for ever, and as far\r\nas legislation could make it sure the country was preserved by entail\r\nto the families of the Voortrekkers. The measure was only carried\r\nbecause of the strenuous support given by the President both within\r\nthe Raad and at those private meetings which practically decide the\r\nimportant business of the country. The President threw off all\r\ndisguise when it came to proposing this measure of protection. For\r\nmany years he had been posing as the one progressive factor in the\r\nState and had induced the great majority of people to believe that\r\nwhile he personally was willing and even anxious to accede to the\r\nreasonable requests of the new population his burghers were\r\nrestraining him. He had for a time succeeded in quelling all\r\nagitation by representing that demonstrations made by the tax-bearing\r\nsection only embarrassed him in his endeavour to relieve them and\r\naggravated the position by raising the suspicions and opposition of\r\nhis Conservative faction.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 a petition signed by upwards of 13,000 aliens in favour of\r\ngranting the extension of the franchise was received by the Raad with\r\ngreat laughter. But notwithstanding this discouragement, during the\r\nfollowing year a monster petition was got up by the National Union.\r\nIt was signed by 35,483 Uitlanders--men of an age and of sufficient\r\neducation to qualify them for a vote in any country. The discussion\r\nwhich took place on this petition was so important, and the decision\r\nso pregnant with results, that copious notes of the Volksraad debate\r\nare published in this volume (Appendix). The only response made to\r\nthis appeal was a firmer riveting of the bonds. It is but just to say\r\nthat the President encountered determined opposition in his attempt\r\nto force his measure through the Raad. The progressive section\r\n(progressive being a purely relative term which the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the country alone can justify) made a stand,\r\nstate that two or three of the intelligent and liberal-minded farmers\r\nbelonging to this progressive party, men who were earnestly desirous\r\nof doing justice to all and furthering the interests of the State,\r\ndeclared at the close of the debate that this meant the loss of\r\nindependence. 'Now,' said one old Boer, 'our country is gone. Nothing\r\ncan settle this but righting, and there is only one end to the fight.\r\nKruger and his Hollanders have taken our independence more surely\r\nthan ever Shepstone did.' The passing of this measure was a\r\nrevelation not only to the Uitlanders, who still believed that\r\nreasonable representations would prevail, but to a section of the\r\nvoters of the country who had failed to realize Mr. Kruger's policy,\r\nand who honestly believed that he would carry some conciliatory\r\nmeasures tending to relieve the strain, and satisfy the large and\r\never-increasing industrial population of aliens. The measure was\r\naccepted on all hands as an ultimatum--a declaration of war to the\r\nknife. There was only one redeeming feature about it: from that time\r\nforward there could be no possibility of misunderstanding the\r\nposition, and no reason to place any credence in the assurances of\r\nthe President. When remonstrated with on this subject of the refusal\r\nof the franchise, and when urged by a prominent man whose sympathies\r\nare wholly with the Boer to consider the advisability of 'opening the\r\ndoor a little,' the President, who was in his own house, stood up,\r\nand leading his adviser by the arm, walked into the middle of the\r\nstreet, and pointed to the Transvaal flag flying over the Government\r\nbuildings, saying, 'You see that flag. If I grant the franchise I may\r\nas well pull it down.'\r\n\r\nIt is seldom possible to indicate the precise period at which a\r\npermanent change in the feeling of a people may be considered to have\r\nbeen effected, but the case of the Uitlanders undoubtedly presents\r\none instance in which this is possible. Up to the passing of this law\r\nquite a considerable section of the people believed that the\r\nPresident and the Volksraad would listen to reason, and would even in\r\nthe near future make considerable concessions. A larger section, it\r\nis true, believed nothing of the sort, but at the same time were so\r\nfar from thinking that it would be necessary to resort to extreme\r\nmeasures that they were content to remain passive, and allow\r\ntheir more sanguine comrades to put their convictions to the test. It\r\nis not too much to say that not one person in a hundred seriously\r\ncontemplated that an appeal to force would be necessary to obtain the\r\nconcessions which were being asked. It might be said that within an\r\nhour the scales dropped from the eyes of the too credulous community,\r\nand the gravity of the position was instantly realized. The passage\r\nof the Bill and the birth of the revolutionary idea were synchronous.\r\n\r\nIn a brief sketch of events, such as this is, it is not possible with\r\ndue regard to simplicity to deal with matters in chronological order,\r\nand for this reason such questions as the franchise, the railway,\r\ndynamite, and others have been explained separately, regardless of\r\nthe fact that it has thereby become necessary to allude to incidents\r\nin the general history for which no explanation or context is\r\nsupplied at the moment. This is particularly the case in the matter\r\nof the franchise, and for the purpose of throwing light on the policy\r\nof which the franchise enactments and the Netherlands Railway affairs\r\nand other matters formed a portion, some explanation should be given\r\nof President Kruger's own part and history in the period under\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nMr. Kruger was elected President in 1882, and re-elected in 1888\r\nwithout serious opposition, his one rival, General Joubert, receiving\r\nan insignificant number of votes. The period for which he was now\r\nelected proved to be one of unexpected, unexampled prosperity,\r\nfurnishing him with the means of completing plans which must have\r\nseemed more or less visionary at their inception; but it was also a\r\nperiod of considerable trial. The development of the Barberton\r\nGoldfields was a revelation to the peasant mind of what the power of\r\ngold is. The influx of prospectors was very considerable, the\r\nincrease of the revenue of the State appeared simply colossal; and no\r\nsooner did the Boer rulers begin to realize the significance of the\r\nBarberton boom than they were confronted with the incomparably\r\ngreater discoveries of the Witwatersrand. The President did not like\r\nthe Uitlanders. He made no concealment of the fact. He could never be\r\ninduced to listen to the petitions of that community, nor to do\r\nanything in the way of roads and bridges in return for the very\r\nheavy contributions which the little community sent to the Republic's\r\ntreasury. In those days he used to plead that the distance\r\nwas great, and the time required for coach-travelling was too\r\nconsiderable; but the development of the Witwatersrand and the\r\ngrowth of Johannesburg within thirty-two miles of the capital, while\r\ndisposing of the pretexts which held good in the case of Barberton,\r\nfound Mr. Kruger no more inclined to make the acquaintance of the\r\nnewcomers than he had been before. Notwithstanding that the law\r\nprescribes that the President shall visit all the districts and towns\r\nof the State at least once during the year, notwithstanding, also,\r\nthe proximity of Johannesburg, the President has only visited the\r\nindustrial capital of the Republic three times in nine years. The\r\nfirst occasion was in the early days--a visit now remembered only as\r\nthe occasion of the banquet at which Mr. Cecil Rhodes, then one of\r\nthe pioneers of the Rand, in proposing the President's health,\r\nappealed to him to make friends with the newcomers, and to extend the\r\nprivileges of the older residents to 'his young burghers--like\r\nmyself.' That was before Mr. Rhodes had secured his concession, and\r\nlong before the Charter was thought of.\r\n\r\nThere is an unreported incident which occurred a year or two later,\r\nconcerning the two strong men of Africa--it was a 'meeting' which\r\ndidn't take place, and only Mr. Rhodes can say how it might have\r\naffected the future of South Africa had it come off. The latter\r\narrived by coach in Pretoria one Saturday morning, and, desiring to\r\nsee the President, asked Mr. Ewald Esselen to accompany him and\r\ninterpret for him. Mr. Rhodes, knowing the peculiar ways of Mr.\r\nKruger, waited at the gate a few yards from the house while Mr.\r\nEsselen went in to inquire if the President would see him. Mr.\r\nKruger's reply was that he would see Mr. Rhodes on Monday. Mr.\r\nEsselen urged that as Mr. Rhodes was obliged to leave on Sunday night\r\nthe reply was tantamount to a refusal. The President answered that\r\nthis was 'Nachtmaal' time and the town was full of his burghers, and\r\nthat he made it a rule, which he would violate for no one, to reserve\r\nthe Saturdays of the Nachtmaal week for his burghers so as to hear\r\nwhat they had to say if any wished to speak to him, as his burghers\r\nwere more to him than anyone else in the world. 'I do no business on\r\nSunday,' he concluded, 'so Rhodes can wait or go!' Mr. Rhodes did not\r\nwait. When he heard the answer he remarked to Mr. Esselen, 'The old\r\ndevil! I meant to work with him, but I'm not going on my knees to\r\nhim. I've got my concession however and he can do nothing.'\r\n\r\nThe second visit of Mr. Kruger to Johannesburg was the famous one of\r\n1890, when the collapse of the share market and the apparent failure\r\nof many of the mines left a thriftless and gambling community wholly\r\nruined and half starving, unable to bear the burden which the State\r\nimposed, almost wholly unappreciative of the possibilities of the\r\nMain Reef, and ignorant of what to do to create an industry and\r\nrestore prosperity. This, at least, the community did understand,\r\nthat they were horribly overtaxed; that those things which might be\r\ntheir salvation, and are necessary conditions for industrial\r\nprosperity--railways, cheap living, consistent and fair\r\ngovernment--were not theirs. The President visited Johannesburg with\r\nthe object of giving the assurance that railways would be built. He\r\naddressed a crowd of many thousands of people from a platform at the\r\nWanderers' Club pavilion. He did not conceal his suspicions of the\r\npeople, and his attempts to conceal his dislike were transparent and\r\ninstantly detected, the result being that there was no harmony\r\nbetween his Honour and the people of Johannesburg. Later in the\r\nevening the crowd, which had hourly become larger and more and more\r\nexcited and dissatisfied, surrounded the house which the President\r\nwas occupying, and, without desire to effect any violence, but by\r\nsimple pressure of numbers, swept in the railings and pillars which\r\nenclosed the house. Most fortunately the Chief of Police had\r\nwithdrawn all the Boer members of the force, and the crowd, to their\r\nsurprise, were held back by Colonial, English, and Irish 'bobbies.'\r\nThis was probably the only thing that prevented a very serious\r\nculmination. As it was, some excited individuals pulled down the\r\nTransvaal flag from the Government buildings, tore it in shreds and\r\ntrampled it under foot. The incident should have been ignored under\r\nthe exceptionally trying conditions of the time, but the Government\r\ndetermined to make much of it. Some arrests were effected, and men\r\nthrown into prison. Bail was refused; in fact, 'martyrs' were made,\r\nand the incident became indelibly stamped on the memory of both Boer\r\nand Uitlander. The President vowed that he would never visit the\r\nplace again, and without doubt made use of his experience to\r\nconsolidate the feeling of his burghers against the Uitlanders.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of burghers several months after this incident, he\r\nreferred to the agitation and constant complaining of the Uitlanders,\r\nand stated that they had only themselves to thank for all their\r\ntroubles, and yet they would blame the Government. He then proceeded\r\nto entertain his hearers with one of the inevitable illustrations\r\nfrom life in the lower animal kingdom. 'They remind me,' said his\r\nHonour, 'of the old baboon that is chained up in my yard. When he\r\nburnt his tail in the Kaffir's fire the other day, he jumped round\r\nand bit me, and that just after I had been feeding him.' For five\r\nyears Mr. Kruger was as good as his word. He would not even pass\r\nthrough Johannesburg when convenience suggested his doing so, but\r\nmade circuits by road to avoid the place of detestation. It was on\r\none of these visits to Krugersdorp, a township within the\r\nWitwatersrand Fields, twenty miles from Johannesburg, that the\r\nPresident, appreciating the fact that besides his beloved burghers\r\nthere might, owing to the proximity of the fields, be some\r\nunregenerate aliens present, commenced his address as follows:\r\n'Burghers, friends, thieves, murderers, newcomers, and others.' This\r\nwas not ill-judged and laborious humour; it was said in absolute\r\nearnest. The references were repeated at various intervals in the\r\naddress and here explained by allusions to the Scriptures and to the\r\nall-merciful God through Whom even the worst might hope to be\r\nredeemed, the inference clearly being that even the Uitlander, by the\r\ngrace of God (and, no doubt, Mr. Kruger), might hope in time to\r\napproach the fitness of the burgher.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another affair occurred, which revived much of the\r\nold feeling expressed at the time of the flag affair. War was\r\ndeclared against Malaboch, a native chief with a following of a few\r\nhundreds, who had, it was alleged, refused to pay his taxes. Such\r\nwars are of frequent occurrence in the Transvaal, the reasons\r\nassigned being usually some failure to pay taxes or to submit to the\r\ndiscipline of the native Commissioners. In this case British subjects\r\nwere commandeered--that is, requisitioned to fight or to find in\r\nmoney or in kind some contribution to the carrying on of the war. It\r\nwas felt that the position of the Republic did not warrant at that\r\ntime a resort to commandeering, a measure which no doubt was\r\nnecessary in the early days when the Republic had no cash; but with a\r\ndeclared surplus of about £1,000,000 in the Treasury, it was deemed\r\nto be an uncivilized and wholly unnecessary measure, and one capable\r\nof the grossest abuse, to permit men of inferior intelligence and\r\ntraining, and of no education, such as the Field-cornets are, to\r\nuse their discretion in levying contributions upon individuals. The\r\nUitlanders were especially sensible of the injustice done to them.\r\nThey had been definitely refused all voice in the affairs of the\r\nState, and they already contributed nine-tenths of the revenue. They\r\nreceived in return an infinitesimal portion in the shape of civil\r\nadministration and public works, and they were distinctly not in\r\nthe humour to be placed at the mercy of Boer officials, who would\r\nundoubtedly mulct them and spare the burghers. Protests were made;\r\nand five of the men commandeered in Pretoria, having point-blank\r\nrefused to comply with the orders, were placed under arrest. The High\r\nCommissioner, Sir Henry (now Lord) Loch, was appealed to, and, acting\r\non instructions from the Imperial Government, immediately proceeded\r\nto Pretoria. The excitement was intense. In Johannesburg a number of\r\nmen were prepared to make a dash on Pretoria to effect the forcible\r\nrelease of the prisoners, and had any steps been taken to enforce the\r\ncommandeering law within the Witwatersrand district, without doubt a\r\ncollision would have taken place. The supply of arms in the town was,\r\nit is true, wholly inadequate for any resistance to the Boers, but in\r\nthe excitement of the time this was not considered.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Loch's visit had the effect of suspending all action; but\r\nthe opinion in Pretoria was that should the High Commissioner proceed\r\nto Johannesburg there would be such an outburst of feeling that no\r\none could foresee the results. Every effort was made to prevent him\r\nfrom going. Among other steps taken by the President was that of\r\nsending over for the President of the Chamber of Mines, Mr. Lionel\r\nPhillips, and requesting him, if he had the interests of the State\r\nand the welfare of the community at heart, to use his influence to\r\ndissuade the High Commissioner from visiting the town in its then\r\nexcited state. Sir Henry Loch, in deference to the opinion expressed\r\non all sides, agreed not to visit Johannesburg, but to receive\r\ndeputations from Johannesburg people at his hotel in Pretoria. The\r\nHigh Commissioner's visit was successful. The Government agreed to\r\nabsolve British subjects from the operation of the Commando Law; but\r\nthe men who had been arrested and already sent under guard to the\r\nfront were allowed to proceed and receive their discharge at the\r\nscene of war, and were compelled to find their own way back,\r\nreceiving no consideration or compensation for the treatment to which\r\nthey had been subjected. In this respect it is difficult to say that\r\nSir Henry Loch achieved all that might have been expected from him.\r\nPossibly, to insist on more than he did would have left President\r\nKruger no alternative but to refuse at all risks. The Volksraad being\r\nthen in session, there may have been some diplomatic reasons for not\r\npressing matters too hard.\r\n\r\nA trivial incident occurred which once more excited bad party\r\nfeeling. The High Commissioner was met at the railway-station by the\r\nPresident in his carriage. The enthusiastic crowd of British subjects\r\nshouldered aside the escorts provided by the Government, took the\r\nhorses from the carriage, and drew it down to the hotel. In the\r\ncourse of the journey an individual mounted the box-seat of the\r\ncarriage with the Union Jack fastened on a bamboo, and in the\r\nexcitement of the moment allowed the folds of England's flag to\r\ngather round the President. His Honour rose very excitedly and struck\r\nat the flag with his walking-stick; but in blissful ignorance of what\r\nwas going on behind him the standard-bearer continued to flip his\r\nHonour with the flag until the hotel was reached. There it was\r\nunderstood that the President would leave the carriage with the High\r\nCommissioner, and under this misapprehension those who had drawn\r\nthe carriage down left their posts and joined the cheering crowd\r\nthe carriage with neither horses nor men to move him, and there he\r\nwas obliged to wait until a number of burghers were called up,\r\nwho drew his Honour off to his own house. The affair was wholly\r\nunpremeditated and almost unobserved at the time, but it was\r\nunfortunately construed by the President as a deliberate insult,\r\nand it increased, if possible, his dislike for the Uitlander.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of dealing with a man of Mr. Kruger's nature and\r\ntraining was further illustrated by another occurrence in these\r\nnegotiations. During a meeting between the President and the High\r\nCommissioner in the presence of their respective staffs the former\r\nbecame very excited and proceeded to speak his mind very openly to\r\nhis friends, referring freely to certain matters which it was\r\nundesirable to mention in the presence of the British party. Mr.\r\nEwald Esselen, the late State Attorney, wrote in Dutch in a very\r\nlarge round schoolboy hand, 'Be careful! There is an interpreter\r\npresent,' and handed the slip of paper to the President. The latter\r\nstopped abruptly, looked at the slip of paper, first one way and then\r\nanother, and after a long pause threw it on the table saying, 'Ewald,\r\nwhat does this mean? What do you _write_ things to me for? Why don't\r\nyou _speak_ so that one can understand?'\r\n\r\nEarly in 1895 efforts were made by the Dutch officials in\r\nJohannesburg and a number of private individuals to induce the\r\nPresident to visit the place again, when it was thought that a better\r\nreception would be accorded him than that which he had experienced on\r\nhis visit in 1890. Mr. Kruger steadily refused for some time, but was\r\neventually persuaded to open in person the first agricultural show\r\nheld on the Witwatersrand. Every precaution was taken to insure him a\r\ngood welcome, or, at least, to avoid any of those signs which would\r\nindicate that Johannesburg likes President Kruger no more than he\r\nlikes Johannesburg; and even those who were most conscious of the\r\nPresident's malign influence did all in their power to make the visit\r\na success, believing themselves to be in duty bound to make any\r\neffort, even at the sacrifice of personal sympathies and opinions, to\r\nturn the current of feeling and to work for a peaceful settlement of\r\nthe difficulties which unfortunately seemed to be thickening all\r\nround. The event passed off without a hitch. It would be too much to\r\nsay that great enthusiasm prevailed; but, at least, a respectful, and\r\nat times even cordial, greeting was accorded to the President, and\r\nhis address in the agricultural show grounds was particularly well\r\nreceived. The President returned to Pretoria that night and was asked\r\nwhat he thought of the affair: 'Did he not consider it an _amende_\r\nfor what had happened five years before? And was he not convinced\r\nfrom personal observation that the people of Johannesburg were loyal,\r\nlaw-abiding, and respectful to the head of the Government under which\r\nthey lived?' Mr. Kruger's reply in the vernacular is unprintable; but\r\nthe polite equivalent is, 'Ugh! A pack of lick-spittles.' In spite of\r\na subsequent promulgation it seems clear that there is no 'forget and\r\nforgive' in his Honour's attitude towards Johannesburg. The result of\r\nthis interview became known and naturally created a very bad\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nDuring his second term of office Mr. Kruger lost much of his personal\r\npopularity and influence with the Boers, and incurred bitter\r\nopposition on account of his policy of favouring members of his own\r\nclique, of granting concessions, and of cultivating the Hollander\r\nfaction and allowing it to dominate the State.\r\n\r\nOutside the Transvaal Mr. Kruger has the reputation of being free\r\nfrom the taint of corruption from which so many of his colleagues\r\nsuffer. Yet within the Republic and among his own people one of the\r\ngravest of the charges levelled against him is that by his example\r\nand connivance he has made himself responsible for much of the\r\nplundering that goes on. There are numbers of cases in which the\r\nPresident's nearest relatives have been proved to be concerned in the\r\nmost flagrant jobs, only to be screened by his influence; such cases,\r\nfor instance, as that of the Vaal River Water Supply Concession, in\r\nwhich Mr. Kruger's son-in-law 'hawked' about for the highest bid the\r\nvote of the Executive Council on a matter which had not yet come\r\nbefore it, and, moreover, sold and duly delivered the aforesaid vote.\r\nThere is the famous libel case in which Mr. Eugene Marais, the editor\r\nof the Dutch paper _Land en Volk_, successfully sustained his\r\nallegation that the President had defrauded the State by charging\r\nheavy travelling expenses for a certain trip on which he was actually\r\nthe guest of the Cape Colonial Government.{12}\r\n\r\nThe party in opposition to President Kruger, with General Joubert at\r\nits head, might, for purposes of nomenclature, be called the\r\nProgressive Party. It was really led by Mr. Ewald Esselen, a\r\nhighly-educated South African, born in the Cape Colony of German\r\nparentage, educated in Edinburgh, and practising as a barrister at\r\nthe Pretoria Bar. Mr. Esselen was a medical student at the time of\r\nthe Boer War of Independence, and having then as he still has\r\nenthusiastic Boer sympathies, volunteered for medical service during\r\nthe war. He subsequently became attached to the President's staff,\r\nand finally, on completing his legal education, was appointed Judge\r\nof the High Court in the Transvaal. Relinquishing his seat on the\r\nBench after some years of honourable service he returned to the Bar,\r\nand became an active factor in politics. Mr. Esselen, from being the\r\nclosest personal adherent of Mr. Kruger, became for a time his most\r\nformidable opponent and his most dreaded critic. A campaign was\r\norganized for the presidential election and feeling ran extremely\r\nhigh. To such lengths, indeed, did the Boer partisans go that for\r\nsome months the possibility of a resort to arms for the settlement of\r\ntheir differences was freely discussed by both parties. The election\r\ntook place in 1893, and at the same time elections of members for the\r\nFirst Volksraad were in progress. Mr. Kruger made masterly use of his\r\nposition in office and of his authority over the officials appointed\r\nduring his _régime_, and for the time being he converted the Civil\r\nService of the country into an election organization. Not even the\r\nenemies of the President will deny that he is both a practised\r\ndiplomat and a determined fighter. By his energy, intrigue, personal\r\ninfluence, and intense determination, he not only compelled his party\r\nto the highest effort, but to a large extent broke the spirit of the\r\nopposition before the real struggle began. There are two stages in\r\nthe Presidential election at which a fight can under certain\r\ncircumstances be made. There were certainly two stages in this\r\nelection. The first is at the polls; the second is in the Volksraad,\r\nwhen objections have to be lodged against candidates and a\r\ncommission of investigation appointed, and the steps necessary for\r\nthe installation of the new President have to be discussed. Mr.\r\nKruger and his party took ample precautions. It has been stated\r\nopenly and without contradiction, and is accepted in the Transvaal as\r\nan unquestionable fact, that at least three properly elected members\r\nof the Volksraad were 'jockeyed' out of their seats because they were\r\nknown to have leanings towards General Joubert. A number of his\r\nsupporters among the prominent officials of the Civil Service were\r\ndisfranchised by the action of President Kruger because they had\r\nfavoured his rival. In a country where the matters of Government\r\nhave been so loosely conducted it is no doubt fairly easy to find\r\nflaws, and the President experienced no difficulty in establishing\r\nsufficient case against General Joubert's supporters to satisfy the\r\npersons appointed by him to investigate matters. On various pretexts\r\nnewly-elected members were debarred from taking their seats. In one\r\ncase, a strong supporter of General Joubert, who was returned by a\r\nmajority of something like six to one, was kept out of his seat\r\nby the mere lodging of an objection by his opponent, the former\r\nrepresentative of the constituency; there being a provision in the\r\nlaw that objections with regard to elections shall be heard by the\r\nVolksraad, and that, pending the return of a new member, the member\r\nlast elected for the constituency shall continue to represent it.\r\nThat the objection lodged in this case was ridiculous in the extreme\r\nhad no bearing on the immediate result. The President, with admirable\r\ngravity, said, 'The law provides that all objections must be heard by\r\nthe Volksraad, and that pending the decision the old member (a\r\nstrenuous supporter of his Honour) shall retain his seat; and before\r\nall things we must support the law.' In the case of Mr. Esselen, who\r\nwas elected member for Potchefstroom, the most flagrant abuses were\r\nproved to have been committed by the polling officer, the landdrost,\r\ndead and absent men having (according to him) rolled up freely to\r\nvote for the Krugerite candidate. Numbers of Mr. Esselen's supporters\r\nwere disqualified on various pretexts, and the voting being conducted\r\nopenly the moral suasion and close supervision of the official\r\n(Krugerite) party were very effective. Mr. Esselen was declared to\r\nhave lost his seat by seven votes. Scrutinies were demanded and\r\nobjections lodged, but without avail. The tactics above indicated\r\nwere pursued in every case. The old Volksraad having been filled with\r\nMr. Kruger's creatures, it was, of course, his interest to support\r\nthe return of old members. He was thus enabled by the law above\r\nquoted to retain an old member in the Volksraad pending the decision\r\nin a case of dispute. Mr. Esselen's defeat was a crushing blow to the\r\nJoubert party, as the want of a leader in the House itself completely\r\ndemoralized the General's followers. The election for President\r\nproceeded, and General Joubert was, without any doubt whatever,\r\nelected by a very considerable majority. The tactics already\r\ndescribed were again followed, and the result was announced as:\r\nKruger, 7,881; Joubert, 7,009. Objections were lodged by General\r\nJoubert, but, deprived of the services of Mr. Esselen in the First\r\nRaad, and overawed by the fierce determination of his opponent, the\r\nGeneral, finding himself in for a struggle, lost heart as usual and\r\ncollapsed.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two men is remarkable. Mr. Kruger, to his\r\ncredit be it said, has not the remotest conception of the meaning of\r\nfear, and would not know how to begin to give in. Mr. Joubert, 'Slim\r\n(sly) Piet,' as he is called, possessing a considerable share of the\r\nreal Africander cunning, is yet no match for his rival in diplomacy,\r\nand has none of his grit and courage. In later years this has been\r\nproved a score of times, and it is, therefore, the more interesting\r\nto recall that at the time of the annexation General Joubert refused\r\nto compromise his principles by taking office under Shepstone, whilst\r\nMr. Kruger was not so staunch; and both before and during the war\r\nGeneral Joubert refused to accept less than what he considered to be\r\nhis rights, and steadily and frequently proclaimed his readiness to\r\nfight whilst Mr. Kruger was diplomatizing.\r\n\r\nThe Commission appointed by the Raad to investigate matters was\r\nconstituted chiefly of Mr. Kruger's supporters, and the result was a\r\nforegone conclusion. They confirmed the result of the election as\r\ndeclared; and Mr. Kruger, with the grim humour which upon occasions\r\ndistinguishes him, seeing an opportunity for inexpensive magnanimity\r\nwhich would gratify himself and be approved by everyone--except\r\nthe recipients--appointed the most prominent supporters of his rival\r\nin the Volksraad to be the official deputation to welcome the new\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe President did not neglect those who had stood by him in his hour\r\nof need. Mr. Kock, landdrost and polling-officer of Potchefstroom,\r\nwho had deserved well of his patron, if for nothing more than the\r\noverthrow of Mr. Esselen, was appointed member of the Executive to\r\nfill a position created purposely for him. The membership of the\r\nExecutive is expressly defined by the Grondwet; but his Honour is not\r\ntrammelled by such considerations. He created the position of Minute\r\nKeeper to the Executive with a handsome salary and a right to vote,\r\nand bestowed this upon his worthy henchman.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Council thus constituted consisted of six members; and\r\nhere again the President contrived to kill two birds with one stone,\r\nthe expression of his gratitude being by no means unprofitable. After\r\nso bitter a struggle and the resort to such extreme measures as he\r\nhad been obliged to use, he anticipated no little opposition even\r\nwithin the inner circle, and, in any case, he as usual deemed it wise\r\nto provide against all contingencies. Dr. Leyds' vote he knew he\r\ncould count on, the interests of the party which the State Secretary\r\nrepresents being such that they are obliged to work with Mr. Kruger.\r\nThe appointment, therefore, of Mr. Kock gave his Honour one half of\r\nthe Executive, and the casting-vote which pertains to his office\r\nturned the scale in his favour. Whatever, therefore, might be his\r\ntroubles with the Volksraad when, by process of justice, reform, or\r\ndeath his adherents should be gradually removed from that Chamber,\r\nhis position was, humanly speaking, assured in the Executive Council\r\nfor the term of his office.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to Mr. Kock's appointment was extremely strong,\r\nculminating in the formulation of charges of theft against him by Mr.\r\nEugene Marais, the spirited editor of the leading Dutch paper, _Land\r\nen Volk_. The charge alleged against Mr. Kock was that during his\r\nterm of office as landdrost at Potchefstroom he had appropriated the\r\ntelegraph-wires in order to fence his own farm. Feeling ran so high\r\nordinary courts was not permitted, but a Special Commissioner, one\r\nnot qualified by legal experience or official position to preside in\r\nsuch a case, was selected. By a positively ludicrous exercise of\r\ndiscretion in the matter of admission of evidence Mr. Kock was\r\ncleared. Mr. Marais, nothing daunted, continued his exposures,\r\nchallenging that action should be taken against himself for libel,\r\nand finally producing photographs taken by competent witnesses\r\nshowing the _corpus delicti in situ_. The President and Mr. Kock were\r\nnot to be drawn, however, and, secure in their newly-acquired\r\npositions, they declined the offer of battle and rested on their\r\nlaurels.\r\n\r\nFor some time the Opposition, now called the Progressive Party, was\r\ncompletely demoralized, and it was not until the following year that\r\nindividuals again endeavoured to give cohesion to the party. Appeals\r\nwere made by them to prominent individuals and firms associated with\r\nthe mining industry for financial support in the manner in which it\r\nis contributed in England for electioneering purposes. A determined\r\nand well-sustained effort was made to educate Boer opinion to better\r\nthings, and to bring such influence to bear on the electorate as\r\nwould result in the return of a better class of men to the Volksraad.\r\nNewspapers conducted with this end in view were circulated throughout\r\nthe country, and when the elections for the Volksraad took place,\r\nspecially qualified agents were sent to ascertain the feeling of the\r\ndistricts, and to work up an opposition to the existing methods of\r\nGovernment. In every case endeavours were made to select a popular\r\nresident within a district of more enlightened views and higher\r\ncharacter than his fellows. A good many thousand pounds were\r\ncontributed and expended for this purpose. Absolutely no stipulation\r\nwas made by the contributors to this fund, except that the aim should\r\nbe for honest and decent government. The funds were placed\r\nunreservedly in the hands of well-known and highly respected men who\r\nwere themselves burghers of the State, and the Uitlanders laid\r\nthemselves out for one more effort to effect the reforms by peaceful\r\nmeans and pressure from within the State. The elections came off and\r\nwere regarded as a triumph for the Progressive Party, which it was\r\nalleged had secured some sixteen out of twenty-six seats in the First\r\nVolksraad, and a similar majority in the Second. Hope revived and\r\nconfidence was restored among the Uitlanders, but old residents in\r\nthe country who knew the Boer character warned the alien community\r\nnot to expect too much, as it was a question yet to be decided how\r\nmany of those who were Progressives at the time of the election would\r\nstand by their professions when brought face to face with the\r\nPresident and his party in battle array.\r\n\r\nThe warning was too well warranted. The Volksraad so constituted was\r\nthe one which rejected with sullen incivility (to apply no harsher\r\nterm) the petition of 40,000 Uitlanders for some measure of franchise\r\nreform. This Progressive Raad was also the one which passed the Bills\r\ncurtailing the liberty of the press, and prohibiting the holding of\r\npublic meetings and the organization of election committees, and\r\nwhich distinguished itself by an attempt to wrest from the High Court\r\nthe decision of a matter still _sub judice_--the cyanide case.\r\n\r\nIn this case the mining industry had combined to test the validity of\r\ncertain patents.{13} In spite of attempts at reasonable compromise on\r\nbehalf of the mines, and these failing, in spite of every effort\r\nmade to expedite the hearing of the case, the question continued\r\nto hang for some years, and in the meantime efforts were being\r\nmade during two successive sessions of the Volksraad to obtain\r\nthe passage of some measure which would practically secure to the\r\nholders of the patents a monopoly for the use of cyanide, or an\r\nindefeasible title to the patents, whether valid in law and properly\r\nacquired or not. These attempts to evade the issue were in themselves\r\na disgrace to a civilized nation. Failing the obtaining of an\r\nabsolute monopoly, an endeavour was made to pass a law that all\r\npatents held without dispute for a certain period should be\r\nunassailable on any grounds. There was a thin attempt at disguising\r\nthe purpose of this measure, but so thin, that not even the\r\noriginators could keep up the pretence, and the struggle was\r\nacknowledged to be one between the supporters of an independent\r\ncourt of justice and honest government on the one side, and a party\r\nof would-be concessionaires--one might say 'pirates'--on the\r\nother. The judges made no secret of their intention to tender their\r\nresignations should the measure pass; the President made no secret\r\nof his desire that it should pass. His party voted as one man in\r\nfavour of it, and the coffee meetings on the Presidential stoep were\r\nunanimously for it. The Raad was exactly divided on the measure,\r\nand it was eventually lost by the casting-vote of the chairman. No\r\nabsolute harm was done, but the revelation of the shameful conditions\r\nof affairs in a Raad of which so much good was expected did as\r\nmuch as anything could do to destroy all hope. It was a painful\r\nexhibition, and the sordid details which came to light, the\r\nunblushing attempts to levy blackmail on those who were threatened\r\nwith pillage by would-be concessionaires, the shameless conduct of\r\nRaad members fighting as hirelings to impose a fresh burden on their\r\nown country, sickened the overburdened community.\r\n\r\nThe Bewaarplaatsen question also excited much discussion, but was not\r\na subject of such close interest to the Uitlander community as\r\nothers, for the reason that but few companies were directly\r\nconcerned. Bewaarplaatsen is a name given to areas granted for the\r\npurpose of conservation of water, for depositing residues of crushed\r\nore, etc.--in fact, they are grants of the surface rights of certain\r\nareas at a lower rate of license than that paid upon claim or mineral\r\nareas. This variation in the licensed areas was a wholly unnecessary\r\ncomplication of the gold law, the difference in cost being\r\ninconsiderable, and the difference in title affording untold\r\npossibilities of lawsuits. In some cases companies had taken out\r\noriginally the more expensive claim-licenses for ground the surface\r\nonly of which it was intended to use. They had been compelled, by\r\norder of the Government, to convert these claims at a later period\r\ninto bewaarplaatsen. They were almost invariably situated on the\r\nsouth side of the Witwatersrand Main Reef, for the reason that, as\r\nthe ground sloped to the south, the water was found there, the mills\r\nwould naturally be erected there, and the inclination of the ground\r\noffered tempting facilities for the disposal of residues. After some\r\nyears of development on the Main Reef it became clear that the\r\nbanket beds, which were known to dip towards the south, became\r\ngradually flatter at the lower levels, and, consequently, it was\r\nclear that bodies of reef would be accessible vertically from\r\nareas south of the reef which had formerly been regarded as quite\r\nworthless as gold-bearing claims. The companies which owned these\r\nbewaarplaatsen now contended that they should be allowed to convert\r\nthem into claims, as, by their enterprise, they had exploited\r\nthe upper levels and revealed the conditions which made the\r\nbewaarplaatsen valuable. The companies had endeavoured to convert\r\nthese bewaarplaatsen into claims when they first discovered that\r\nthere was a possibility of their becoming valuable, and that at a\r\ntime when the areas themselves were of extremely little market\r\nvalue to any except the holders of the surface rights. They were\r\nunsuccessful in this through some lack of provision in the law,\r\nand year after year the subject was fought out and postponed, the\r\ndisputed ground all the time becoming more and more valuable, and\r\nconsequently a greater prize for the concessionaire and pirate, and\r\na greater incentive to bribery on all hands, until it came to be\r\nregarded by the worthy members of the Volksraad as something very\r\nlike a special dispensation of Providence, intended to provide\r\nannuities for Volksraad members at the expense of the unfortunate\r\nowners. After a particularly fierce struggle, the Volksraad went so\r\nfar as to decide that those companies which had been obliged to\r\nconvert their original claim-holdings into bewaarplaatsen should\r\nbe allowed to re-convert them to claims and to retain them. Even\r\nthis was only gained after the Minister of Mines had, on his own\r\nresponsibility, issued the claim licenses, and so forced the\r\nVolksraad to face the issue of confirming or reversing his action!\r\n\r\nIn this matter the President again fought tooth and nail against the\r\nindustry, and most strenuous efforts were made by him and his party\r\nto obtain a reversal of the decision, but without effect. This,\r\nhowever, only disposed of a small portion of the ground at stake.\r\nWith regard to those areas which had never been held as claims, the\r\nissue lay between two parties known respectively as the companies,\r\nwho were the surface-owners, and the applicants. The applicants,\r\naccording to the polite fiction, were those who, having no claim\r\nsuperior to that of any other individual member of the public, had\r\nhappened to have priority in order of application. As a matter of\r\nfact, they were Government officials, political supporters and\r\nrelatives of the President, financed and guided by two or three of\r\nthe professional concession-hunters and hangers-on of Mr. Kruger's\r\nGovernment. Notwithstanding the existence of a law specifically\r\nprohibiting Government servants from concerning themselves in other\r\nbusiness and speculations, the parties to this arrangement entered\r\ninto notarial contracts determining the apportionment of the plunder,\r\nand undertaking to use their influence in every way with the\r\nPresident and his party and with members of the Volksraad to secure\r\nthe granting of the rights in dispute to themselves. With them was\r\nassociated the originator and holder of another infamous monopoly,\r\nand it was stated by him in the Chamber of Mines, that should they\r\nfail to obtain these rights for themselves they were prepared to\r\nco-operate with another party and force the Government to put them up\r\nfor public auction, so that at any rate the mines should not have\r\nthem. The object of this threat was to compel the mining companies to\r\ncome to terms with him and compromise matters.\r\n\r\nOne of the notarial contracts referred to has been made public, and\r\nit contains the names of Mr. 'Koos' Smit, the Government Railway\r\nCommissioner, and one of the highest officials in the State;\r\nLanddrost Schutte, Chief Magistrate of Pretoria, and Mr. Hendrik\r\nSchoeman, one of the most prominent commandants in the Transvaal and\r\na near relation of the President. Needless to say, all are members of\r\nthe Kruger family party, and were most prominent supporters of his\r\nHonour at the time of the 1893 election. They claim that they were\r\ndefinitely promised a concession for the bewaarplaatsen as a reward\r\nfor their services in this election. The precedent quoted on\r\nbehalf of the companies in support of their claim is that of the\r\nbrickmaker's license under the Gold Law. Brickmakers have privileges\r\nunder their license similar to those granted with bewaarplaatsen, but\r\nin their case it is provided that should gold be discovered or be\r\nbelieved to exist in the areas granted under their licenses, the\r\nholder of the license shall have the right to convert his area into\r\nLaw. The companies urged that this reveals the intention of the law,\r\nand that such a condition was omitted in connection with\r\nbewaarplaatsen simply and solely through oversight, and because at\r\nthat time it never occurred to anyone to suppose that the\r\ngold-bearing deposits would shelve off and be accessible at such\r\ngreat distances from the outcrop as where the bewaarplaatsen are\r\nlocated. The companies moreover pointed out that these areas were in\r\nevery case located in the middle of property held under mining\r\nlicenses, that they themselves owned the surface of the property and\r\ntherefore no one else could work on them, that the areas were in\r\nthemselves too small and too irregular in shape to be worked\r\nindependently of the surrounding ground, and that the granting of\r\nthem to others could not be justified by any right on the part of\r\napplicants, and would merely be placing in their hands the means of\r\nimposing on the owners of the surfaces and the adjacent claims an\r\nexcessive purchase price or the alternative of being blocked in the\r\ndevelopment of their own ground. After the Second Raad had decided in\r\nprinciple in favour of the surface-holders, action was taken by the\r\nFirst Raad, and a change of front was effected by a measure\r\nalteration, which hung the question up for another year. Everyone\r\nrealized that this was secured by the influence of the President in\r\nthe first place and by the pliability of Raad members in the second,\r\non the ground that the matter was too profitable to them personally\r\nto be disposed of until it became absolutely compulsory.{14}\r\n\r\nOne of the first concessions granted by the Boer Government after the\r\nrestoration of the country to them was the liquor monopoly. Under\r\nthis grant a factory established within a few miles of Pretoria has\r\nthe sole right to distil spirits. Time and very considerable\r\nexperience are in all countries necessary for the manufacture of good\r\nliquor, and the natural conditions are not more favourable to the\r\nindustry in the Transvaal than elsewhere, consequently the product is\r\nnot regarded with great favour. The enterprise, however, is a very\r\nprosperous one, being dependent almost entirely upon the sale of\r\nliquor to natives. For a number of years representations were made by\r\nthe Chamber of Mines on behalf of the industry, by individuals and by\r\npublic petitions, with the object of controlling the liquor trade and\r\nproperly enforcing the laws which already existed. The following\r\nterse summary of the evils resulting from this sale of liquor is\r\ntaken from the report of the Chamber of Mines for 1895. Unfortunately\r\nthe remarks apply equally well to-day:\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, no doubt that one of the greatest difficulties with\r\nwhich local employers have to deal is the question of the liquor\r\ntrade. In very many cases the liquor supplied to the natives is of\r\nthe vilest quality, quickly inflaming those who take it to madness,\r\nand causing the faction fights which sometimes have fatal results,\r\nand always lead to the, at any rate, temporary disablement of some of\r\nthe combatants, and the damaging of property. Accidents, too, are\r\noften attributable to the effects of drink, and altogether, as stated\r\nin the resolutions, a large percentage of the deaths among the\r\nnatives here is directly due to drink. In its bearing on the labour\r\nquestion, drink also plays an important part. The shortness in the\r\nsupply, as compared with the demand for labour, has been accentuated\r\nby it. Where possible more natives are kept in the compounds than are\r\nactually required for the work to be done, to make allowance for\r\nthose who are disabled by drink.\r\n\r\nThe granting of licenses to liquor houses was carried to such an\r\nextreme that at last the entire community rose against it, and the\r\nexpression of opinion was so strong that the Government was compelled\r\nto make a show of deferring to it. Involved in the liquor question\r\nwas the matter of police, and arising out of this, again, was the\r\nquestion of dealing with crime in general, including the gold and\r\namalgam stealing that was known to be carried on on a considerable\r\nscale at the expense of the companies.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General, or State Attorney, as he is called in the\r\nTransvaal, is the responsible head of the Law Department, and until\r\nlately was the departmental head of the police. The gentleman then\r\noccupying the position of State Attorney was peculiarly unfit--in the\r\nmidst of that world of unfitness--for the duties which he was\r\nsupposed to perform. He was removed from office, and after\r\nconsiderable negotiation Mr. Esselen was prevailed upon at a great\r\nmonetary sacrifice to accept the position of State Attorney, he\r\nstipulating that he should have a free hand in reorganizing the\r\ndetective and police forces. During the months in which Mr. Esselen\r\ncontinued in office admirable reforms were introduced, and a very\r\nappreciable influence was exercised on the condition of affairs in\r\nJohannesburg. It is inadvisable to state explicitly the nature of the\r\nobjections which existed against some of the officials employed under\r\nthe former _régime_; it is sufficient that they were proved to be\r\nparticipators in the offences which they were specially employed to\r\nsuppress. Mr. Esselen's first step was to appoint as chief detective\r\nan officer borrowed from the Cape Colonial Government, Mr. Andrew\r\nTrimble, who in a very little while showed that courage and honesty\r\nof purpose could not only effect considerable reforms, but could\r\nprovoke the undisguised and fierce hostility of a very large section\r\nof the community. The canteen keepers were up in arms; the illicit\r\ngold buyers left no stone unturned; the hangers-on of the Government\r\nlost no opportunity in their campaign against Mr. Esselen and his\r\nsubordinate and their reforms. The liveliest satisfaction however was\r\nexpressed by all those whose interest it was to have matters\r\nconducted decently and honestly, and who had no interest in crime\r\nexcept so far as its suppression was concerned. Representation was\r\nsecured for the Chamber of Mines upon one of the licensing bodies,\r\nand here, too, a very appreciable result followed. During Mr.\r\nEsselen's term of office all went well as far as the public were\r\nconcerned, but influences were soon at work to undermine the two\r\nreforming officials. It was represented to the President that Mr.\r\nTrimble had once been in the British army; that he was even then a\r\nsubject of the Queen, and entitled to a pension from the Cape\r\nGovernment. The canteen interest on the goldfields, playing upon the\r\nprejudices of the Boers, represented that this was unfitting the\r\ndignity of the Republic. The President, who was too shrewd to be\r\ncaught with such chaff, was perfectly ready to support them for the\r\nsake of the liquor interest, which for him constitutes a very useful\r\nelectioneering and political agency throughout the country. Mr.\r\nEsselen was sent for, and it was represented to him by the President\r\nthat the employment of a British subject in such a responsible office\r\nas that of chief detective was repugnant to the burghers. The reply\r\nwas that it was competent for the Executive to naturalize Mr. Trimble\r\nat once and so remove the objection, the Government having power in\r\nspecial cases to dispense with the conditions of the Naturalization\r\nLaw--a power frequently exercised in the case of their Hollander\r\nfriends. The President, in reply, stated that it could not be done,\r\nand he appealed to Mr. Esselen to select a man of another\r\nnationality--'a Frenchman, German, or even an American'--this last\r\nbeing a concession wrung from him by Mr. Esselen's soothing\r\nsuggestion that the Chief of Police should be familiar with the\r\nlanguage of the criminal classes. The hitch was maintained for some\r\nmonths, but finally the influences on the side of the President\r\nbecame too strong, and when it became clear that the many months\r\nof laborious work and self-sacrifice which had been given in the\r\ninterests of reform were to be nullified by the appointment of a\r\ncreature who would connive at every breach of the law, Mr. Esselen\r\ndecided to stand or fall by his subordinate, the result being a\r\ntriumph for the President.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Esselen's place there was appointed as State Attorney Dr.\r\nCoster, a Hollander, who however declined to have anything to do with\r\nthe organization of the police; and in Mr. Trimble's stead reappeared\r\nthe individual whom he had superseded and whose services had been\r\ndispensed with.{15} The triumph of the back-door influences was again\r\ncomplete and the blow was a very nasty one to the mining industry.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that at about this time the Uitlander community stopped\r\nall agitation, and that a mood of sullen opposition and discontent\r\ntook its place. Hope was absolutely dead as abuse after abuse and\r\nscandal after scandal were showered upon them during the Session of\r\n1895. Some of the acts of the Volksraad cut at the foundation of all\r\nsecurity. In the early days of the Republic the Volksraad members had\r\ntaken it upon themselves to reverse several of the decisions of the\r\nHigh Court, and in one case where the Government was being sued for\r\nthe fulfilment of a contract the Volksraad had passed a resolution\r\nabsolving the Government from certain terms of the contract. The\r\ndecision of the Court, delivered by Chief Justice Kotzé, was to the\r\neffect that if the Volksraad should take a decision in conflict with\r\nan existing law, that law became _ipso facto_ so far modified. In\r\nanother case (the Dom's case) a resolution was passed disabling the\r\naggrieved individual from taking action against the Government; in\r\nanother, where the responsibility of the Government for the\r\nmaintenance of roads had been indicated by a judgment for £1,000\r\ndamages, a law was passed in defiance of the conditions of the\r\nGrondwet, which stipulates for a period of notice and publication for\r\nproposed enactments, absolving the Government from all damages of\r\nthis nature.\r\n\r\nMore than once laws were passed with retroactive effect--truly one of\r\nthe grossest abuses possible for a civilized Government. But perhaps\r\nthe most startling case of all was that concerning the proclamation\r\nof the farm Witfontein. This farm had been proclaimed a public\r\ndigging open for pegging on a certain hour of a certain day. An\r\nunprecedented rush of peggers took place. The Government, fearing a\r\nriot and ignoring their obvious duty in the matter of police\r\nprotection and the maintenance of order, issued an illegal notice\r\nwithdrawing the proclamation, and decided to give out the claims by\r\nmeans of lottery. Numbers of prospectors pegged out claims\r\nnotwithstanding this, and the prospect of legal difficulties being\r\nimminent the Government submitted a measure to the Volksraad, passed\r\nalso in defiance of Grondwet provisions, which was broadly to the\r\neffect that all persons who considered that they had claims for\r\ndamages against the Government in regard to the farm Witfontein and\r\nthe proclamation thereof, had none, and that the Government was\r\nabsolved from all liability in this respect. This enactment was only\r\npassed after several persons had signified their intention to sue the\r\nGovernment. The Raad was in fact becoming familiar with the process\r\nof tampering with the Grondwet and members appeared ready to act on\r\nthe dictates of their own sweet will without regard to consequences\r\nor laws.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions the President and Executive had treated with\r\ncontempt the decisions of the High Court, and had practically and\r\npublicly reversed them. There are many instances which it is not\r\nnecessary to quote but among the best-known and most instructive ones\r\nare the two cases known as the 'Rachmann' and 'April' cases. Rachmann\r\nwas an Indian and a British subject, well educated, far better\r\neducated indeed than the Boer of the country. In following a strayed\r\nhorse he had trespassed on the farm of one of the members of the\r\nFirst Raad. He was arrested and charged with intent to steal, tried\r\nby the owner's brother, who was a Field-cornet (district justice),\r\nand sentenced to receive twenty-five lashes and to pay a fine, the\r\nsame sentence being meted out to his Hottentot servant who\r\naccompanied him. Rachmann protested and noted an appeal, stating\r\n(which was the fact) that it was not within the power of a\r\nField-cornet to inflict lashes, and at the same time he offered\r\nsecurity to the value of £40 pending the appeal. His protests were\r\ndisregarded and he was flogged. Not being a native in the sense in\r\nwhich the law uses the term--_i.e._, a member of the aboriginal\r\nraces--he could plead that he was not within the jurisdiction of a\r\nField-cornet, and there is no doubt that the punishment was inflicted\r\nwith full knowledge of its illegality. Rachmann sued Mr. George\r\nMeyer, the Field-cornet in question, in the Circuit Court and\r\nobtained judgment and a considerable sum in damages, the presiding\r\njudge, Dr. Jorissen, animadverting with severity upon the conduct of\r\nthe official. Meyer shortly afterwards obtained from Government the\r\namount of his pecuniary loss through the affair, the President\r\nstating that he had acted in his official capacity and that they\r\nshould protect him.\r\n\r\nThe 'April' case was one in which an unfortunate native named April,\r\nhaving worked for a number of years for a farmer on promise of\r\ncertain payment in cattle and having completed his term, applied for\r\npayment and a permit to travel through the district. On some trivial\r\npretext this was refused him, his cattle were seized, and himself and\r\nhis wives and children forcibly retained in the service of the Boer.\r\nHe appealed to the nearest official, Field-cornet Prinsloo, who acted\r\nin a particularly barbarous and unjustifiable manner, so that the\r\nChief Justice before whom the case was heard (when April having\r\nenlisted the sympathy of some white people was enabled to make an\r\nappeal) characterized Prinsloo's conduct as brutal in the extreme and\r\na flagrant abuse of power perpetrated with the aim of establishing\r\nslavery. Judgment was given against Prinsloo with all costs. Within a\r\nfew days of this decision being arrived at the President addressing a\r\nmeeting of burghers publicly announced that the Government had\r\nreimbursed Prinsloo, adding, 'Notwithstanding the judgment of the\r\nHigh Court, we consider Prinsloo to have been right.'\r\n\r\nActions of this kind have a distinct and very evil influence upon the\r\nsupply of native labour. No attempt is made to supply the industry\r\nwith natives, or to protect the natives whilst on their way to and\r\nfrom the mines. The position became so bad that the Chamber of Mines\r\ninstituted a department with a highly-paid official at its head to\r\norganize supply. It would inadequately describe the position to say\r\nthat the Government have rendered the Chamber of Mines no assistance.\r\nIndeed, it appears as though the officials in the country had of set\r\npurpose hindered in every way possible the work so necessary to\r\nthe working of the industry on profitable lines. Agencies were\r\nestablished in all the neighbouring territories. Some of the tribes\r\ndeclined to work in the Transvaal on account of the risks of\r\nhighway-robbery and personal violence which they ran _en route_.\r\nIn one case an effort was made by certain mine-owners to meet the\r\ndifficulty by importing a whole tribe--men, women, and children--from\r\nBasutoland and locating them upon an adjacent farm. There is however\r\na law known as the Plakkerswet, or Squatters' Law, which, framed\r\nwith that peculiar cunning for which the Transvaal Government\r\nhave achieved a reputation, has the appearance of aiming at the\r\nimprovement of the native labour supply whilst in effect it does the\r\nopposite. It provides that not more than five families may reside\r\nupon one farm, the 'family' being an adult male with or without women\r\nand children. Ostensibly the law purports to prevent the squatting\r\ntogether of natives in large numbers and in idleness. As a matter of\r\nfact however the law is not applied in the cases of Boer farmers.\r\nFrom the President downwards the Boers own farms on which hundreds\r\nof families are allowed to remain, paying their hut-taxes and\r\ncontributing largely to the prosperity of the land-owner. In the case\r\nof the Uitlander however there seems to be a principle at stake, as\r\nthe mine-owners above referred to found to their cost. No sooner had\r\nthey located their tribe and provided them with all the conditions\r\nnecessary to comfort than an official came down to them, Plakkerswet\r\nin hand, and removed all except the five allowed by law and\r\ndistributed them among his friends and relations. The experiment has\r\nnot been repeated.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1894 the Chamber of Mines received assurances from the\r\nGovernment that if they would prepare a Pass Law which would include\r\nprovisions for the protection of natives, for the regulation of\r\ntheir relations with employers, and for their right to travel within\r\nthe country, the Government would give their support to the measure\r\nand would endeavour to have it adopted by the Volksraad. The\r\nCommissioner for Native Affairs, General Joubert, admitted his\r\ninability to deal with so complex an affair, and gratefully accepted\r\nthe aid of the Chamber. Such a concession on the part of the\r\nGovernment was regarded as highly satisfactory; the law was prepared,\r\neverything was explained and agreed to, the support of the Government\r\nwas promised to the draft law, and it was anticipated that it would\r\ncome into force during the Session of 1894. Such was not the case. It\r\nremained pigeon-holed throughout 1894 and 1895, and in the last days\r\nof the latter Session the law was passed; but an important omission\r\noccurred. The Government forgot to create the department to carry out\r\nthe law, so that by the end of 1895 the men were no nearer having a\r\nworkable law than ever. But reforms when introduced by the Transvaal\r\nGovernment, are not usually without an object, although not\r\nnecessarily the declared one. An opportunity was here presented to\r\nthe President to recognize past services, and he appointed to an\r\noffice which required the highest intelligence experience character\r\nand zeal an individual who had been implicated in two disgraceful\r\ncharges and who, having failed to clear himself had been dismissed\r\nhis office by the Boer Government not two years previously. There was\r\nbut one explanation forthcoming. The individual in question was a\r\npolitical supporter of the President and brother of a member of the\r\nExecutive Council. No department has yet been created; but a chief\r\nhas been appointed at a good salary, and the Pass Law has been\r\nproclaimed in one district of the Witwatersrand out of several; so\r\nthat a measure which was designed to effect an immense saving in\r\nexpense and convenience to the mining industry was by the appointment\r\nof an improper man and the neglect to organize a department rendered\r\nquite useless, and by partial promulgation it was made even\r\ndetrimental.{16}\r\n\r\nIt has been aptly said of the Boers--and the present instance\r\nillustrates the truth of the remark--that reform with them seems to\r\nbe impossible; because, in the first place, they do not know what to\r\ndo; in the second place, if they did, they have not got the men to do\r\nit; and, in the third place, if they had the men, they show no\r\nconception of a duty higher than that of utilizing every opportunity\r\nfor personal advantage.{17} To the uninitiated it may well be a\r\npuzzle that President Kruger should encourage a system aiming so\r\ndirectly at the strangling of an industry which is the mainstay of\r\nthe country; but in order to appreciate his motives it is necessary\r\nto see things from his point of view. He and his party are not\r\ndesirous of cheapening the cost of production. He does not aim at\r\nenabling the ever-increasing alien population to work lower-grade\r\nmines, and so double or treble the number of immigrants, even though\r\nit should profit the revenue of the country. A proposal was once made\r\nto proclaim as a public field the town lands of Pretoria--that is to\r\nsay, to enable the public to prospect, and if results warranted,\r\nto open up mines on the lands--some thousands of acres in\r\nextent--surrounding the town. The President attended the debate in\r\nthe Second Raad and violently opposed the measure. The appeal at the\r\nend of his address is perhaps as instructive as anything Mr. Kruger\r\nhas said. 'Stop and think what you are doing,' he exclaimed, 'before\r\nyou throw fresh fields open. Look at Johannesburg. See what a trouble\r\nand expense it is to us. We have enough gold and enough gold-seekers\r\nin the country already. For all you know there may be another\r\nWitwatersrand at your very feet.'\r\n\r\nIn January, 1891, the average wage for native labourers was £2 2s.\r\nper head per month. In 1893 it had risen to £2 18s. 10d., in 1895 to\r\n£3 3s. 6d. In other South African States wages rule from 15s. to 30s.\r\nper month, and the failure to facilitate the introduction of natives\r\nfrom outside and to protect them is largely responsible for the high\r\nfigures paid on the Rand. Unquestionably the ill-will of the Boer\r\nGovernment is to blame for the consistent neglect of this growing\r\nneed of the mines. If decent protection and facilities were given,\r\nthe wage could be reduced to £1 15s. per month. The Government has it\r\nin its power to give the mines labour at this price, but, as a matter\r\nof fact, there is no desire to see the lower-grade mines working. A\r\nreduction of £1 a month--that is, to £2 3s. 6d.--would mean an\r\nannual saving of £650,000, and the main reason why nothing has been\r\ndone to obtain this reduction is that President Kruger holds that the\r\ngold fields are already big enough and that their further extension\r\nwould be a calamity.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1895 considerable suspicion and uneasiness were\r\naroused by indications of the growth of the German policy. The\r\ncommercial section of the community was disturbed by reports of\r\nsecret arrangements favouring German importers. Facilities were\r\ngiven, and 'through rates' quoted from Hamburg to Johannesburg at a\r\nreduction which appeared to be greater than any economies in sea\r\ntransport, coupled with the complete elimination of agency charges,\r\nwould warrant. The formal opening of the Delagoa Bay Railway by the\r\nPresident furnished him with an opportunity to express with\r\nsignificant emphasis his friendliness for all things German. At a\r\nbanquet given in honour of the German Emperor's birthday, January 27,\r\n1895, the President, after eulogizing the old Emperor William, the\r\npresent Emperor, and the loyalty of the Germans in the Transvaal,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\nThe latter I experienced once again at the time of the Kaffir War.\r\nOne day three or four Germans came to me and said: 'We are indeed not\r\nnaturalized, and are still subjects of our Emperor in Germany, but we\r\nenjoy the advantages of this country, and are ready to defend it in\r\naccordance with its laws. If your Excellency requires our services,\r\nwe are willing to march out.' And they marched. That is the spirit\r\nwhich I admire. They were under the laws, they worked under the laws,\r\nthey obeyed the laws, and they fell in war under the laws. All my\r\nsubjects are not so minded. The English, for instance, although they\r\nbehave themselves properly and are loyal to the State, always fall\r\nback upon England when it suits their purpose. Therefore I shall ever\r\npromote the interests of Germany, though it be but with the resources\r\nof a child, such as my land is considered. This child is now being\r\ntrodden upon by one great Power, and the natural consequence is that\r\nit seeks protection from another. The time has come to knit ties of\r\nthe closest friendship between Germany and the South African\r\nRepublic--ties such as are natural between father and child.\r\n\r\nThe very considerable increase in the number of Germans, and the\r\npositive statement that a great many men of military training were\r\ncoming out for service in the Transvaal, that officers were being\r\nemployed to work up the artillery and to design forts, all tended to\r\nincrease the feeling of intense dissatisfaction and uneasiness which\r\nculminated in the outbreak at the close of the year. Dr. Leyds, it\r\nwas well known, went on a political mission to Lisbon and to Berlin,\r\nand it was stated that large sums had been withdrawn from the\r\nTreasury and charged to the secret service fund, the handling\r\nof which was entrusted to this gentleman. Dr. Leyds' personal\r\npopularity, never very great, was at the lowest possible ebb. He was\r\nregarded as the incarnation of Hollanderism--the 'head and front' of\r\nthat detested influence. It was not credited to him in the Transvaal,\r\nas it has been elsewhere, that he designed or prompted the policy\r\nagainst the Uitlanders. There it is fully appreciated that there is\r\nbut one man in it, and that man President Kruger. Dr. Leyds and\r\nothers may be and are clever and willing tools. They may lend acidity\r\nor offensiveness to a hostile despatch, they may add a twist or two\r\nto a tortuous policy, but the policy is President Kruger's own, the\r\nmethods are his own, all but the minor details. Much as the\r\nHollander-German clique may profit by their alliance with Mr. Kruger,\r\nit is not to be believed that he is deceived. He regards them as\r\nhandy instruments and ready agents. If they profit by the\r\nassociation, they do so at the expense of the accursed Uitlander; but\r\nthere is no intention on Mr. Kruger's part to allow Germany or\r\nHolland to secure a permanent hold over the Republic, any more than\r\nhe would allow England to increase hers. He has played off one\r\nagainst another with consummate skill.\r\n\r\nEarly in his official career Dr. Leyds was guilty of an indiscretion\r\nsuch as few would have suspected him of. Shortly after his\r\nappointment as Attorney-General he wrote to a friend in Holland,\r\ngiving his opinion of the Members of the Executive. His judgment was\r\nsound; except of one man. Unfortunately for Dr. Leyds, he quarrelled\r\nwith his correspondent; and the letter was of such a nature that,\r\nwhen published, it made extremely unpleasant reading. Generals\r\nJoubert and Smit, who had been described with admirable truth and\r\ncandour, were so enraged that they demanded the instant dismissal of\r\nthe 'conceited young popinjay' who had dared to criticise his\r\nmasters. The President, however, who had been described as an\r\nignorant, narrow-minded, pig-headed, and irascible old Boer\r\nwhom--with the others thrown in--the writer could play with and twist\r\nround his finger as he chose, was not disturbed by the criticism. In\r\nreply to appeals for forgiveness on the score of youth, and in spite\r\nof the opposition of his colleagues, President Kruger agreed to\r\nretain Dr. Leyds in office, remarking that he was a capable young\r\nfellow and would know better in course of time, and explaining to\r\nhim personally that he would keep him there just as long as it suited\r\nhis (the President's) convenience. The association has lasted for ten\r\nyears, so it is to be presumed that Dr. Leyds has changed his opinion\r\nof President Kruger, and frankly realized his position.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of 1896, when the question of the release on\r\nbail of the reform prisoners seemed to be of some moment, a\r\nwell-known Pretoria man, friendly to the Government, called upon\r\nPresident Kruger and urged the advisability of allowing the prisoners\r\nout on bail, and with considerable lack of tact explained that it was\r\nwell known that the President's humane nature inclined him to be\r\nlenient, but that the malign influence of others was believed to be\r\nswaying him in this matter. The old President jumped up in a huff and\r\nsaid, 'Ja, ja, ja! You always say it is somebody else! First, it was\r\nJorissen who did everything; then it was Nellmapius; and then it was\r\nLeyds. Well, Jorissen is done for; Nellmapius is dead; Leyds is in\r\nEurope--who is it now?'\r\n\r\nThe President's opinion of himself may be commended as food for\r\nreflection to those who think they know everything about the inner\r\nworkings of the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nDr. Leyds' reputation, unfavourable as it had been, was not improved\r\nby the Selati Railway exposure. Rightly or wrongly, in this matter,\r\nas in the jobs of the Netherlands Railway and several others of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, he has been held responsible in the public\r\nmind for the financial loss which the Republic sustained. When he\r\nleft, ostensibly on a recruiting trip, few--very few--believed that\r\nthe illness was a physical one. It is alleged that a gentleman\r\non President Faure's staff, on hearing that Dr. Leyds had gone\r\nto Berlin to consult a physician, inquired what the ailment was?\r\n'Mal de gorge,' was the reply. 'Ah,' said the officer, 'mal de\r\ngorge--diplomatique.' And that was the opinion in the Transvaal,\r\nalbeit differently expressed.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the limits of this volume nor is it at all\r\nnecessary to review all the measures which have been passed by the\r\nVolksraad and pressed by the Government unnecessarily burdening the\r\nUitlanders and unjustifiably assailing their rights; such for\r\ninstance as the Election Law, which made it a crime to form\r\nCommittees or do any of those things which are regarded everywhere as\r\npart of the legitimate business of elections--thus leaving Mr. Kruger\r\nthe sole master of electioneering machinery, namely, the Government\r\nofficials. The Public Meetings Act was another monstrous infringement\r\nof rights. By it a policeman has the right to disperse any gathering\r\nof more than seven persons, if in his opinion it be desirable.\r\nImagine it! Liberty of Speech against the Discretion of a Transvaal\r\npoliceman! But the list would be long, and the tale monotonous. And\r\nas long and equally monotonous would be the list of the measures\r\nproposed or threatened, but fortunately not carried. However, the\r\nreview of the period prior to 1896, and the statement of the causes\r\nleading to the outbreak, may fitly be brought to a close by the\r\nrecital of some of the measures under both the above headings which\r\ngrace the records of the Session of 1895.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the Grondwet (the written constitution of the\r\ncountry) prescribes certain formalities for the introduction of new\r\nlaws. In order to evade the law, and so avoid hostile criticism of\r\nproposed measures, in order, in fact, to prevent the public and even\r\nthe Volksraad members from knowing and studying or explaining and\r\ndigesting the intended legislation, it has become the practice of the\r\nGovernment to propose and rush through the most radical and important\r\nenactments in the form of amendments or explanations of existing\r\nlaws. Prior to 1895 the Transfer Law imposed a tax of 4 per cent.\r\nupon the purchase-price of fixed property; and in the case of sales\r\nfor shares a valuation of the property was made by the Government\r\ndistrict officials, and transfer duty was paid on the amount of the\r\nvaluation. This was universally done in the case of claims, which\r\nmust of necessity in most instances be transferred several times\r\nbefore they become registered in the name of the company eventually\r\nworking them. It was admitted that to pay 4 per cent. of full value\r\non every transfer, or to pay 4 per cent. on the nominal value of\r\nground on which years of work would have to be done and large sums of\r\nmoney expended before shareholders could reap one pennyworth of\r\nprofit would be iniquitous. In 1895, however, the Raad thought\r\notherwise, and amended the law by the insertion of the words 'in cash\r\nor shares' after the words 'purchase-price.' The result is, that\r\nowners who have acquired claims at great cost, who have paid licenses\r\ncontinuously on their claims, and who have paid full transfer duty on\r\neach nominal change of ownership, necessary to consolidation into\r\nworkable blocks or groups, are now required to pay again in cash 4\r\nper cent. on the total capital allotted in respect of these claims in\r\nthe company formed to work them. Members of the Raad, in supporting\r\nthis measure, did not hesitate to argue that it was a good law,\r\nbecause the burghers did not sell their farms for shares, but for\r\ncash, and it was right to tax those people who deal in shares.\r\n\r\nThe sense of insecurity which obtains during the Sessions of the Raad\r\nis due scarcely less to the threats which are not fulfilled and\r\nattempts which do not succeed, than to what is actually compassed. A\r\ndirect tax on gold has more than once been threatened; concessions\r\nfor cyanide, jam, bread, biscuits, and woollen fabrics were all\r\nattempted. The revival of an obsolete provision by which the\r\nGovernment can claim a royalty on the gold from 'mynpachts,' or\r\nmining leases, has been promised, and it is almost as much expected\r\nas it is dreaded.\r\n\r\nWith a monotony which is wearying, but which does not diminish the\r\nunfortunate Uitlanders' interest in the subject, the burden of every\r\nmeasure falls on the alien. One more instance will suffice. It\r\nillustrates the Hollander-Boer genius for fulfilling the letter and\r\nbreaking the spirit of a covenant. It was notified that Government\r\nwere about to introduce a war tax, and that this tax was to be one of\r\n£20 per farm, to be levied in event of war if in the opinion of the\r\nGovernment it should be necessary. Much surprise was felt that\r\nanything so unfavourable to the Boers as a tax on farms should be\r\nproposed. When the measure came on for discussion it was found to\r\ncontain provisions exempting the owner who personally resided on his\r\nfarm, and especially and definitely taxing those farms which are\r\nowned by companies, associations, corporations, or partnerships. The\r\nBoer, it is well known, takes no shares in companies, joins no\r\nassociations, and has partnership with no one. This law was shelved\r\nin 1895, but has since been passed.{18} It is of a piece with the\r\nrest. Having sold his farm to the Uitlander, the Boer now proceeds\r\nto plunder him: and 'plunder' is not too strong a word when it is\r\nrealized that the tax falls, not on the really valuable farms of the\r\nhigh veld, which are nearly all owned by individuals, and are all\r\noccupied, but on the undeveloped outlying farms, the rentable value\r\nof which would not on the average suffice to pay the tax! Indeed, one\r\nvery large land-owner stated to the Government at the time, that if\r\nthis law were passed and put in force, they might take all his\r\nrentals good and bad in lieu of the tax, as it would pay him better!\r\n\r\nThese were matters which more immediately concerned persons of\r\ncertain means. There is another matter, however, which very directly\r\nconcerned every individual who had any intention of remaining in the\r\ncountry; that is, the matter of education. A dead set had always been\r\nmade by the Transvaal Government against any encouragement of liberal\r\neducation which would involve the use or even recognition of the\r\nEnglish language. Indeed, some of the legislators have been known to\r\nexpress the opinion that education was not by any means desirable, as\r\nit taught the rising generation to look with contempt on the hardy\r\nVoortrekkers; and an interesting debate is on record, in which\r\nmembers pointedly opposed the granting of facilities for the\r\neducation of their own women-kind, on the ground that presently the\r\nwomen would be found reading books and newspapers instead of doing\r\ntheir work, and would soon get to know more than their fathers,\r\nhusbands, and brothers, and would, as a consequence, quickly get out\r\nof hand. It did not seem to occur to these worthy gentlemen that the\r\nproper course would be to educate the men. But it would not be fair\r\nto take this view as the representative one. On the point of the\r\nEnglish language, however, and the refusal to give any facilities for\r\nthe education of Uitlander children, the Boer legislature is\r\npractically unanimous. The appalling consequences of allowing the\r\nyoung population to grow up in absolute ignorance were realized by\r\nthe people of Johannesburg, and efforts were constantly made to\r\ninduce the Government to recognize the evil that was growing in the\r\nState. The efforts were so entirely unsuccessful that the Uitlanders\r\nfound in this as in other cases that nothing would be done unless\r\nthey did it for themselves. A fund was opened, to which very liberal\r\ndonations were made. The services of a Director-General were secured,\r\nand an Educational Council was elected. A comprehensive scheme of\r\neducation--in the first place for the Rand district, but intended to\r\nbe extended ultimately for the benefit of the whole of the Uitlander\r\npopulation in the Transvaal--was devised, and it was calculated that\r\nin the course of a few years a fund of close upon half a million of\r\nmoney would be required, and would be raised, in order to place\r\neducational facilities within the reach of the people. Needless to\r\nsay, this did not at all square with the policy of the Transvaal\r\nGovernment, and the scheme was looked upon with the utmost disfavour.\r\nIn order to defeat it, the Superintendent-General of Education, Dr.\r\nMansvelt, a Hollander, who for six years had degraded his high office\r\nto the level of a political engine, felt himself called upon to do\r\nsomething--something to trail the red herring across the too hot\r\nscent; and he intimated that more liberal measures would be\r\nintroduced during the Session of 1895, and in his report proposed\r\ncertain amendments to the existing law, which would (in appearance,\r\nbut, alas! not in fact) improve the condition of the Uitlander. The\r\nfollowing letter appearing in the London _Times_, on October 3, 1896,\r\nalthough dealing with a period some months later than that under\r\nreview, explains the position with authority and clearness--a\r\nposition which has not been materially altered, except for the worse,\r\nduring Dr. Mansvelt's _régime_. It will be noted that the last-named\r\ngentleman coupled with his 'liberal' provisions the suggestion that\r\nall schools, except those of the State, should be suppressed. Such a\r\nsuggestion reveals very clearly the aim of this 'Reform' measure.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI trust you will allow me a little space with a view to enable me to\r\ncorrect, by the application of a little wholesome fact, the erroneous\r\nimpression which has been created in England with reference to the\r\neducation of Uitlanders in the Transvaal by recent crude and\r\nill-considered expressions of opinion, notably by Mr. Reginald\r\nStatham and Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, in a letter addressed to one of your contemporaries,\r\ninformed the British public that in view of a liberal Government\r\ngrant of £4 per head per annum, the Transvaal Uitlander had nothing\r\nto complain of in respect to education. As Mr. ---- claims to be\r\ncompletely informed on Transvaal politics, he can only have been\r\nguilty of a deliberate, if not malicious _suppressio veri_ when he\r\nomitted to say that, like most of the legislation of this country,\r\nwhich has for its ostensible object the amelioration of the condition\r\nof the Uitlander, this measure, which looks like munificence at first\r\nsight, has been rendered practically inoperative by the conditions\r\nwhich hedge it round. Take, for example, a school of 100 children.\r\nStrike out ten as being under age, ten as having been too short a\r\ntime at school, twenty as suspected of being of Dutch parentage. Out\r\nof the sixty that remain suppose fifty satisfy the inspector in the\r\nDutch language and history, and you have as your allowance for the\r\nyear £200--a sum which is insufficient to pay the Dutch teacher\r\nemployed to bring the children up to the required standard in that\r\nlanguage. It is small wonder, then, that most teachers prefer to\r\ndispense with this Will-o'-the-wisp grant altogether, seeing that the\r\nefforts of some to earn it have resulted in pecuniary loss. The\r\nactual sum expended on Uitlander schools last year amounted to £650,\r\nor 1s. 10d. a head out of a total expenditure for education of\r\n£63,000, the expenditure per Dutch child amounting to £8 6s. 1d.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain considers the new educational law for Johannesburg as\r\na subject for gratulation. I should have thought that his recent\r\ndealings with Pretoria would have suggested to him as a statesman\r\nthat felicitations upon the passing of a vague and absolutely\r\nundefined measure might possibly be a little too premature. A\r\nVolksraad, which only rejected the forcible closing of private\r\nschools by a majority of two votes, is hardly likely to give the\r\nExecutive _carte blanche_ to deal with Uitlander education without\r\nsome understanding, tacit or declared, as to how this power is to be\r\nwielded. Be that as it may, nearly two months have elapsed since the\r\npassing of a measure which was to come into operation at once, and\r\nnothing has been done. In the meantime, we can learn from the\r\ninspired press and other sources that English schools which desire\r\naid under the new law must be prepared to give instruction in\r\nStandard V. and upwards, and entirely in the Dutch language. So far,\r\nthe Superintendent of Education, whether acting under instructions or\r\non his own initiative, has been absolutely immovable on this point,\r\nand the much-vaunted law promises to be as much a dead letter as the\r\n1s. 10d. grant. The Johannesburg Council of Education has exerted its\r\ninfluence to secure such an interpretation of the new law as would\r\nlead to the establishment of schools where Dutch and English children\r\nmight sit side by side, and so work towards establishing a bond of\r\nsympathy and the eventual blending of the races. The Pretoria\r\nauthorities however refuse to entertain the idea of meeting the\r\nUitlander in a conciliatory spirit on anything like equal terms, but\r\nwill only treat with us on the footing of master and servant. A\r\ncurious and almost inexplicable feature of the situation is the fact\r\nthat hundreds of Boers are clamouring for the better instruction of\r\ntheir children in English, but which is steadfastly refused them.\r\n\r\nI might enlarge on what I have written, and point out the injustice\r\nand the gross system of extortion practised by the Government in\r\nmaking Johannesburg pay something like £7 per head for the education\r\nof Dutch children, whilst it has to pay from £5 to £15 per annum\r\nfor the education of each child of its own, meanwhile leaving\r\nhundreds growing up in the blackest ignorance and crime. Any comment\r\nwould, however, lay me open to the charge of bias and partisanship,\r\nand I therefore confine myself to the simple statement of a few\r\nfacts, which I challenge anyone to controvert, leaving the reader to\r\ndraw his own conclusions.\r\n\r\n  I am, sir, yours, etc.,\r\n            JOHN ROBINSON,\r\n             _Director-General Johannesburg\r\n             Educational Council._\r\n\r\nImagine it! £650 used for the children of those who contributed\r\nnine-tenths of the £63,000 spent on education!\r\n\r\nThe succession of flagrant jobs, the revelation of abuses\r\nunsuspected, the point-blank refusal to effect any reasonable reforms\r\nhad filled the Uitlanders' cup perilously full, and during the latter\r\nhalf of 1895 the prospect of any change for the better, except at the\r\ncost of fighting, was generally realized to be very poor indeed.\r\n\r\nTrouble came to South Africa with the end of 1895. It very nearly\r\ncame earlier. Mention has been made that the Netherlands Railway\r\nCompany practically dictates the relations of the Transvaal with the\r\nother States in South Africa by means of its tariffs. The competition\r\nbetween the Cape, Natal and Delagoa lines having become very keen,\r\nand the Cape service by superior management and easier gradients\r\nhaving secured the largest share of the carrying trade, attempts were\r\nmade to effect a different division of profits. Negotiations failed\r\nto bring the various parties to terms, and owing to the policy of the\r\nNetherlands Railway Company, the Cape Colony and Free State, whose\r\ninterests were common, were in spirit very hostile to the Transvaal,\r\nand bitterly resentful of the policy whereby a foreign corporation\r\nwas aided to profit enormously to the detriment of the sister South\r\nAfrican States. After all that the Colonial and Free State Dutch had\r\ndone for their Transvaal brethren in days of stress and adversity, it\r\nwas felt to be base ingratitude to hinder their trade and tax their\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Colony-Free State line ends at the Vaal River. Thence all\r\ngoods are carried over the Netherlands Railway Company's section to\r\nJohannesburg, a distance of about fifty miles. In order to handicap\r\nthe southern line, an excessive rate was imposed for carriage on this\r\nsection. Even at the present time the tariff is 8-1/2d. per ton per\r\nmile, as against a rate of about 3d. with which the other two lines\r\nare favoured. Notwithstanding this, however, and the obstructions\r\nplaced in the way by obnoxious regulations and deliberate blocking\r\nof the line with loaded trucks at Vereeniging, and also the blocking\r\nof Johannesburg stations by non-delivery of goods--measures which\r\nresulted sometimes in a delay of months in delivery, and sometimes in\r\nthe destruction or loss of the goods--the Southern line more than\r\nheld its own. The block was overcome by off-loading goods at the Vaal\r\nRiver and transporting them to Johannesburg by mule and ox waggons.\r\n\r\nMr. Kruger and his Hollander friends were almost beaten when the\r\nPresident played his last card. He intimated his intention to close\r\nthe Vaal River drifts against over-sea goods, and, by thus preventing\r\nthe use of waggons, to force all traffic on to _his_ railways upon\r\n_his_ terms; and as the threat did not bring the Colony and Free\r\nState to the proper frame of mind, he closed them. This was a\r\nflagrant breach of the London Convention, and as such it was reported\r\nby the High Commissioner to Mr. Chamberlain, and imperial\r\nintervention was asked. Mr. Chamberlain replied that it was a matter\r\nmost closely affecting the Colony, and he required, before dealing\r\nwith it, to have the assurance of the Colonial Government that, in\r\nthe event of war resulting, the cost of the campaign would be borne,\r\nshare and share alike, by the Imperial and Colonial Governments, and\r\nthat the latter would transport troops over their lines free of\r\ncharge. Such was the indignation in the Colony at the treatment\r\naccorded it that the terms were at once agreed to--a truly\r\nsignificant fact when it is realized that the Ministry undertaking\r\nthis responsibility had been put and was maintained in office by the\r\nDutch party, and included in its members the best and most pronounced\r\nAfricander representatives. But Mr. Kruger is not easily 'cornered.'\r\nHis unfailing instinct told him that business was meant when he\r\nreceived Mr. Chamberlain's ultimatum to open the drifts. The\r\nPresident 'climbed down' and opened them! He has several advantages\r\nwhich other leaders of men have not, and among them is that of having\r\nlittle or no pride. He will bluster and bluff and bully when\r\noccasion seems to warrant it; but when his judgment warns him that\r\nhe has gone as far as he prudently can, he will alter his tactics as\r\npromptly and dispassionately as one changes one's coat to suit the\r\nvarying conditions of the weather. Mr. Kruger climbed down! It did\r\nnot worry him, nor did he take shame that he had failed. He climbed\r\ndown, as he had done before in the Stellaland affair, the Banjailand\r\ntrek, the commandeering incident, and as he no doubt will do in\r\nothers; for he may bluff hard, but it will take a great deal to make\r\nhim fight. There is one matter upon which Mr. Kruger's judgment is\r\nperfect: he can judge the 'breaking strain' to a nicety. He climbs\r\ndown, but he is not beaten; for as surely as the dammed stream will\r\nseek its outlet, so surely will the old Dutchman pursue his settled\r\naim.\r\n\r\nWar is war, and always bad; but sometimes worse; for the cause is\r\nstill a mighty factor, as those may see who contrast the probable\r\neffects upon the people of South Africa of war on the drifts question\r\nwith the actual results of the Jameson raid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter II\r\n\r\n{04} Among the first notes which poor Colley--brave, wise, generous,\r\nand unlucky--wrote after taking office, was one containing these\r\nwords: 'Whether I ... shall find that South Africa is to me, as it is\r\nsaid to be in general, \"the grave of all good reputations,\" remains\r\nto be seen.'\r\n\r\n{05} See Appendix A for the full text of the Pretoria Convention.\r\n\r\n{06} In February, 1898, he was elected for the fourth time.\r\n\r\n{07} For full text of London Convention, see Appendix B. (July,\r\n1899). A very extensive correspondence has passed on the subject of\r\nthe suzerainty. The Transvaal Government now construe the omission of\r\nthe Preamble to the 1881 Convention as the result of an agreement to\r\nabolish the suzerainty. Mr. Chamberlain points out that the London\r\nConvention contains specific and not implied amendments of the\r\nPretoria Convention; that the direct request for abolition of the\r\nsuzerainty was refused by Lord Derby; that the preamble as the\r\nfundamental declaration must be deemed to be in force; and that if\r\nnot, the same reason which is adduced against the continued existence\r\nof the suzerainty would hold good against the independence of the\r\nTransvaal, for in the preamble of the 1881 Convention alone is any\r\nmention made of either the grant or the reservation.\r\n\r\n{08} Written August, 1896.\r\n\r\n{09} To those who are not familiar with the conditions of the\r\ncountry, it will seem incredible that the legislative body could be\r\n'fooled' on such a subject. The extracts from the newspaper reports\r\nof the Raad's proceedings, printed in Appendix D of this volume, will\r\nhelp them to understand and believe.\r\n\r\n{10} The above has been brought up to date for publication,\r\nJuly, 1899.\r\n\r\n{11} Except on the goldfields, where the appointments are made\r\nby Government.\r\n\r\n{12} For Volksraad records on this subject see Appendix C.\r\n\r\n{13} The decision of the High Court was given in November, 1896, in\r\nfavour of the combined companies on all points, and the patents were\r\nthus declared to be invalid!\r\n\r\n{14} During the session of '96 the Volksraad decided to put the\r\nbewaarplaatsen up for public auction, the proceeds of the sale to be\r\ndivided equally between the Government and the original owners of the\r\nfarms on which the bewaarplaatsen had been granted. The _alleged_\r\nreason for this decision is that the areas in question are immensely\r\nvaluable, and the State and the owners should profit by them, whilst\r\nthe companies should be afforded an opportunity of acquiring them at\r\na fair price. The _real_ reason is that the companies had refused\r\nto be blackmailed further; and the 'defence' funds not being\r\nforthcoming, the gentlemen of the back-stairs had introduced the\r\ningenious arrangement safeguarding the original owners' rights,\r\nhaving previously 'arranged' with the same owners. The excuse that\r\nthe areas are too valuable to be given away to the companies is as\r\nillogical and ridiculous as the excuse that the Uitlanders are too\r\nnumerous to justify the granting of the franchise now. When the\r\nquestions were first raised there were neither great values nor large\r\nnumbers in existence. They were questions of principle and justice;\r\nand the fact that 'values' and 'numbers' have grown during the years\r\nof struggle in no way justifies the course taken, but rather shows\r\nvery clearly the magnitude of the injustice done during the years of\r\nunjustifiable denial.\r\n\r\nThis decision shows with admirable clearness how the Uitlander fares\r\nat the hands of the Government. There were, in the last stage of the\r\naffair, four parties concerned: the Government, who are by law\r\nexpressly debarred from selling claims (except in case of overdue\r\nlicenses), and are obliged to allot them for the consideration of\r\nspecified license fees only; the owners of the farms, who are\r\nsimilarly debarred and are compensated in other ways for the throwing\r\nopen of their farms; the 'applicants,' who have been described\r\nelsewhere; and the surface-owners, the mining companies, who were in\r\npossession. Only one of these parties had the slenderest claim to\r\ncompensation--namely, the companies, who must inevitably be disturbed\r\nin the possession of the surface by allowing others to work on or\r\nunder it. But they get nothing; whilst the Government and the 'owner'\r\n(both of whom had years before derived the fullest profit allowed by\r\nlaw from these areas in the form of licenses), and the 'applicants'\r\n(who have allied themselves with the 'owners'), divide as\r\ncompensation the proceeds of the auction!\r\n\r\n{15} (July, 1899.) This individual has been again removed--this\r\ntime by the present State Attorney, Mr. Smuts.\r\n\r\n{16} (July, 1899.) Provision was made for the costs of this\r\ndepartment by doubling the pass fee. In the early days of\r\nJohannesburg as soon as it became evident that hospital accommodation\r\nwas necessary, application was made to the Government for a site\r\n(which was granted on the hill then outside the town), and for some\r\nmonetary assistance. A fund was also publicly subscribed and the\r\nhospital built. For the maintenance of the hospital two plans were\r\nadopted: one, the collection of funds once a year, _i.e._, Hospital\r\nSaturday, a source which has yielded steadily between £2,000 and\r\n£3,000; two, having in view the immense number of native cases which\r\nrequired treatment and the extent to which a native is responsible\r\nfor unsanitary conditions, it was proposed to impose upon them a fee\r\nof 1s. per month for their passes, the proceeds of this to be devoted\r\nentirely to the hospital. For several years this continued to yield\r\nsufficient for the purpose. The Transvaal Government, although\r\naccepting the plan proposed by the Uitlanders and for a considerable\r\ntime carrying it out faithfully, did not establish the right\r\npermanently but adopted the formality of voting the proceeds of the\r\npass-fee year by year. There came a year when the Raad in its wisdom\r\ndecided that this source of revenue was too precarious for so worthy\r\nan object as the hospital, and they decided to vote instead an annual\r\nsubsidy of £30,000. It was then known that the fees of the past year\r\nhad amounted to over £40,000 and there was every prospect of steady\r\nannual increase. This explains why a seemingly generous subsidy by\r\nthe Government does not meet with that hearty recognition to which it\r\nis apparently entitled. When a Pass Department was proposed, the\r\nGovernment inquired how it was suggested to maintain it. The Chamber\r\nof Mines proposed to raise the pass fee from 1s. to 2s. per month,\r\nthe extra shilling to be devoted entirely to the administration of\r\nthe Pass Law. With the experience of the hospital shilling in mind\r\nparticular care was taken to have the agreement minuted and confirmed\r\nin writing. Nevertheless, it transpired in the evidence given at the\r\nIndustrial Commission that the department was being run at a cost of\r\nslightly over £12,000 a year, whilst the proceeds of the shilling\r\nreached the respectable total of £150,000 a year. The Government,\r\ntherefore, by a breach of agreement, make £138,000 a year out of the\r\npass fund, and £120,000 a year out of the hospital fund; and the\r\nmining industry suffers in the meantime through maladministration in\r\nthe department, and are doubly taxed in the sense that the companies\r\nhave been obliged to establish and maintain at their own cost other\r\nhospitals all along the reef. It is not suggested that the companies\r\nshould not provide hospitals, the point is that having established a\r\nfund, which although nominally paid by the natives really has to be\r\nmade up to them in wages, they were entitled to the benefit of that\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n{17} The story is told of two up-country Boers who applied to the\r\n\r\nPresident for appointments, and received the reply, 'What _can_ I\r\ndo for you? All the important offices are filled, and you are not\r\neducated enough to be clerks!'\r\n\r\n{18} (July, 1899.) The law has been declared by the law officers\r\nof the Crown to be a breach of the London Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving failed in their constitutional attempts to secure a reasonable\r\nvoice in the government, or any redress of their grievances, there\r\ncame the time when men's thoughts naturally turned to the last\r\nexpedient--force. Up to and so late as the Volksraad Session of 1895\r\na constitutional agitation for rights had been carried on by the\r\nTransvaal National Union, a body representing the unenfranchised\r\nportion of the population. Of its members but few belonged to the\r\nclass of wealthy mine and land owners: they had so far abstained from\r\ntaking any part in a political organization which was viewed with\r\ndislike and suspicion by the Government and the great majority of the\r\nBoers. It has been asserted by a few Progressive members of the Raad\r\nthat many of the Boers were themselves opposed to the policy adopted\r\ntowards the newcomers; but, whilst this may be to some extent true,\r\nit is more than questionable whether any of the burghers were willing\r\nto concede a share in the power of government, although it is certain\r\nthat great numbers would not have taken active steps against the\r\nUitlanders but for the invasion by a foreign force. Any extending of\r\nthe franchise means to the great majority of the Boers a\r\nproportionate loss of independence.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter of the Independence of the Republic is discussed it\r\nmust not be forgotten that independence conveys something to the\r\nBoers which is radically different from what it means to anyone else.\r\nThat the State should continue for ever to be independent and\r\nprosperous--a true republic--would be mockery heaped on injury if the\r\nabsolute domination by the Boer party should cease; and when the\r\nparrot-like cry of 'The Independence of the State is threatened' is\r\nraised again and again _à propos_ of the most trivial measures and\r\nincidents, this idea is the one that prompts it. Instances\r\ninnumerable could be quoted seemingly illustrating the Boer\r\nlegislators' inability to distinguish between simple measures of\r\nreform and justice, and measures aimed at undermining the State's\r\nstability and independence. It is not stupidity! It is that the Boer\r\nrealizes at least one of the inevitable consequences of reform--that\r\nthe ignorant and incapable must go under. Reform is the death-knell\r\nof his oligarchy, and therefore a danger to the independence of the\r\nState--as he sees it. Until the European people who have lately\r\nbecome so deeply concerned in Transvaal affairs realize how widely\r\ndivergent are the two interpretations of 'Independence,' they will\r\nnot have begun to understand the Transvaal Question.\r\n\r\nThe National Union did not represent any particular class in the\r\nUitlander community. It was formed of men drawn from all classes who\r\nfelt that the conditions of life were becoming intolerable, and that\r\nsomething would have to be done by the community to bring about\r\nreforms which the legislature showed no signs of voluntarily\r\nintroducing.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that it consisted of men drawn from all classes, the\r\nqualification should be made that the richer classes, that is to say,\r\nthe capitalists of the country, were very meagrely if at all\r\nrepresented. Many efforts had been made to enlist the sympathies of\r\nthe capitalists, and to draw them into the movement, but the 'big\r\nfirms,' as they were styled, for a very long time refused to take any\r\npart whatever, preferring to abstain entirely rather than associate\r\nthemselves with a definite agitation. They pleaded, and no doubt\r\nfairly, that in case of failure they with their vested interests\r\nwould be the ones to suffer, while in the event of success they would\r\nnot benefit in a greater degree than the individuals who had little\r\nor no material stake. One by one however they were drawn into the\r\npolitical movement to the extent of supplying funds for carrying on\r\nthe reform agitation, or of giving monetary support to those who were\r\nstimulating and organizing the Progressive party among the Boers.\r\nThere can be no doubt that prior to 1895 the wealthier men without\r\nexception refused to consider the possibility of violent measures.\r\nIt was only when they realized that the Boer party were determinedly\r\nhostile--organizing very large encroachments upon the privileges of\r\nthe Uitlanders and designing fresh burdens to be borne by them--and\r\nwhen it became clear that the dangers threatening as a result of\r\ntheir own supine attitude were worse than any disfavour with which\r\nthey might be viewed on account of political action, that they began\r\nto take an active part with others in the agitation for reform. It\r\nwas not until the Volksraad in the Session of 1895 revealed their\r\nreal policy and their fixed determination to effect no reform that\r\nmen began to talk of the possibility of revolutionary measures\r\nbecoming necessary. The subject once mooted was frequently discussed,\r\nand once discussed became familiar; and the thing which a few months\r\nbefore had been regarded as out of the bounds of possibility came to\r\nbe looked upon as a very probable contingency. The extraordinary boom\r\nin shares, land, and all kinds of property, which lasted throughout\r\nthe year, no doubt operated against the maturing of this feeling, but\r\nit nevertheless continued to grow. The most dissatisfied section of\r\nthe Rand was, naturally enough, that one which included the South\r\nAfrican Uitlander. These men, born in South Africa, or having spent\r\nthe best years of their lives there, felt extremely bitter against\r\nthe Boer Government, and were moved by feelings which were not in any\r\nway connected with considerations of material gain. With them were\r\nclosely associated men of all nationalities who had determined to\r\nmake their homes in the Transvaal, and these formed the class which\r\nhas been disparagingly referred to as 'the political element,' but\r\nwhich the experience of every country shows to be the backbone of a\r\nnation. They were in fact the men who meant to have a hand in the\r\nfuture of South Africa. After them came the much larger class whose\r\ninterest in the reforms was based mainly upon the fact that they\r\nsuffered from the abuses and over-taxation of the Government.\r\n\r\nFor several years a very strong feeling against the capitalists had\r\nruled in Johannesburg. Men who thoroughly knew the Boer had\r\nprophesied and continued throughout to prophesy that absolutely\r\nnothing would be done to improve the conditions, and that the\r\ncapitalists might as well throw in their lot with the general public\r\nearly in the day as be forced to do so later, after spending their\r\nthousands in fruitless efforts for reform, and after committing\r\nthemselves to a policy which would be regarded as selfish,\r\npusillanimous, and foolish. The moneyed men no doubt occupied a very\r\nprominent and powerful position. They were constantly besought by\r\nthe Reform leaders to side with them; they were looked to by the\r\nProgressive Party in the Boer camp to aid reform by peaceful measures\r\nonly, to exercise all their influence towards preventing rash or\r\nviolent measures being taken by the more excited party, and to trust\r\nto time and patience to achieve those results which they were all\r\nhonestly desirous of bringing about; and they were approached, as has\r\nbeen stated, by the President and his party when moments of danger\r\narrived, and when it was felt that their influence could be used\r\ntowards the preservation of peace,--as witness the Loch incident.\r\n\r\n'It is no crime to be a capitalist,' said one commentator on the late\r\nevents, and neither is it necessary to attribute to this section of\r\nthe community motives of patriotism to justify their association with\r\nthe Reform movement. It is not intended to suggest that the men who\r\ndid associate themselves eventually with it were not moved by any\r\nhigher consideration than that of protecting their interests--in many\r\ncases a far larger view than this was taken; but it may be\r\nasked,--assuming that the capitalists were not moved by higher\r\nconsiderations,--What is there in their position which should debar\r\nthem from endeavouring to introduce the reforms which would benefit\r\nthem only equally with every other honest man in the community?\r\n\r\nMost of the wealthy houses in the Transvaal are either offshoots of\r\nor have supporting connections with firms in England or on the\r\nContinent. Between them and their principals much correspondence had\r\ntaken place on the political situation. As far as these houses were\r\nconcerned, it was impossible for them to enter upon any movement\r\nwithout the consent of their European associates. For this reason the\r\nReform movement, as it eventually took place, has in some ways\r\nthe appearance of and has very frequently been stigmatized as an\r\norganization planned and promoted outside the Transvaal. The fact is\r\nthat Mr. Alfred Beit, of the firm of Wernher, Beit and Co., London,\r\nand Mr. Cecil Rhodes, managing director of the Consolidated\r\nGoldfields, may be regarded as the chiefs to whom the ultimate\r\ndecision as to whether it was necessary from the capitalistic point\r\nof view to resort to extreme measures was necessarily left. Each of\r\nthese gentlemen controls in person and through his business\r\nassociates many millions of money invested in the Transvaal; each of\r\nthem was, of course, a heavy sufferer under the existing conditions\r\naffecting the mining industry, and each, as a business man, must\r\nhave been desirous of reform in the administration. Mr. Beit acted\r\nin concert with Mr. Lionel Phillips, of H. Eckstein and Co., the\r\nJohannesburg representatives of Wernher, Beit and Co. Mr. Rhodes was\r\nrepresented by his brother, Colonel Francis Rhodes, and Mr. J.H.\r\nHammond, of the Consolidated Goldfields Company in Johannesburg. Mr.\r\nGeorge Farrar, another very large mine-owner, who joined a little\r\nlater than the others, with the gentlemen above named, may be\r\nconsidered to have represented the capitalist element in the earlier\r\nstages of the Reform movement. The other elements were represented by\r\nMr. Charles Leonard, the chairman of the National Union, and one or\r\ntwo other prominent members of that body.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say with whom the idea of the movement, including\r\nthe arrangement with Dr. Jameson, originated. Perhaps it germinated\r\nwhen Dr. Jameson read the life of Clive! Probably it was the result\r\nof discussion, and no one man's idea. At any rate arms and ammunition\r\nwere purchased, and arrangements were made by which they should be\r\nsmuggled into the country concealed in machinery or gold-mining\r\nappliances. During the month of November Messrs. Leonard and Phillips\r\nwent to Capetown to see Mr. Rhodes, in order to assure themselves\r\nfinally as to the course which was to be pursued. The position of Mr.\r\nRhodes in the matter was recognised by them to be a difficult one.\r\nWhilst as the managing director of the Consolidated Goldfields he\r\nhad as much right as any other man interested in the Transvaal\r\nwould have to concern himself in a movement of this nature, his right\r\nto act in his capacity of managing director of the Chartered Company\r\nwould depend entirely on the nature of the part which he professed\r\nto play; but his position as Prime Minister of the Colony made the\r\nalready difficult position much more complicated. Realizing this,\r\nMessrs. Leonard and Phillips acting on behalf of the others\r\ndetermined to have a perfectly clear understanding and to ascertain\r\nfrom Mr. Rhodes definitely what were his objects in associating\r\nhimself with the movement. The matter was discussed at Mr. Rhodes'\r\nhouse, and the report given by the two deputies to their colleagues\r\non their return was that Mr. Rhodes frankly admitted that he had two\r\nobjects in view: one was to obtain an amelioration of the conditions\r\nsuch as he was entitled to claim as representing an enormous amount\r\nof capital invested in the Transvaal; the other object is best\r\ndescribed by Mr. Leonard. 'We read to him,' said that gentleman when\r\nreporting to his comrades the result of his visit, 'the draft of our\r\ndeclaration of rights. He was leaning against the mantelpiece smoking\r\na cigarette, and when it came to that part of the document in which\r\nwe refer to Free Trade in South African products he turned round\r\nsuddenly, and said: \"That is what I want. That is all I ask of you.\r\nThe rest will come in time. We must have a beginning, and that will\r\nbe the beginning. If you people get your rights, the Customs Union,\r\nRailway Convention, and other things will all come in time.\" He then\r\nadded that we must take our own time about this movement, and that he\r\nwould keep Jameson on the frontier as long as it was necessary as a\r\nmoral support, and also to come to our assistance should we get\r\nourselves into a tight place. We asked him how he hoped to recoup\r\nhimself for his share of the expense in keeping Jameson's force on\r\nthe border, which should be borne by us jointly. He said that seeing\r\nthe extent of his interests in the country, he would be amply repaid\r\nby the improvement in the conditions which it was intended to\r\neffect.'\r\n\r\nIt has since been suggested that the object of the movement was to\r\n'steal the country' and to annex it to Rhodesia, in order to\r\nrehabilitate the Chartered Company. The suggestion is too ludicrous\r\nfor serious discussion. It must be obvious to anyone that the\r\npersons most concerned in the movement, and whose interests lay in\r\nthe Rand, would be the very last to consent to any such scheme. There\r\nappears to be no conceivable basis upon which such an arrangement\r\ncould have been entered into, and it is quite clear that no sensible\r\nbusiness man having interests in a rich country in a comparatively\r\nadvanced state of development would consent to share that certainty\r\nwith a new country such as Rhodesia, the value of which, however\r\npromising, has still to be proved. Notwithstanding the ludicrous\r\nnature of the charge, it is quite certain that the Boers have a\r\ndeep-rooted conviction of its truth.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements with Dr. Jameson were made with him in person.\r\nDuring the month of September he visited Johannesburg, and it was\r\nthen agreed that he should maintain a force of some 1,500 mounted men\r\nfully equipped, a number of Maxims, and some field artillery; that he\r\nwas, in addition to this, to have with him 1,500 spare rifles and a\r\nquantity of spare ammunition; and that about 5,000 rifles, three\r\nMaxim guns, and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition were to be smuggled\r\ninto Johannesburg. It was calculated that in the town itself there\r\nwould be, perhaps, 1,000 rifles privately owned. Thus, in the event\r\nof a junction of forces being effected, Johannesburg would be able to\r\ncommand about 9,000 armed men, with a fair equipment of machine-guns\r\nand cannon. Nor was this all, for on the original plan it was\r\nintended to seize the fort and magazines at Pretoria. And\r\ncircumstances favoured the plans of the Johannesburg men. The\r\nsurrounding wall of the fort, a mere barrack, had been removed on one\r\nside in order to effect some additions; there were only about 100 men\r\nstationed there, and all except half a dozen could be counted on as\r\nbeing asleep after 9 p.m. There never was a simpler sensational task\r\nin the world than that of seizing the Pretoria fort--fifty men could\r\nhave done it. But there was more to be done than the mere taking. In\r\nthe fort there were known to be some 10,000 rifles, ten or twelve\r\nfield-pieces, and 12,000,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition; and it\r\nwas designed to seize the fort and the railway on the night of the\r\noutbreak and, by means of one or two trains, to carry off as much of\r\nthe material as possible and destroy the rest.\r\n\r\nAssociation with Dr. Jameson as the leader of an invading force is\r\nthe one portion of their programme which the Reform leaders find it\r\nextremely difficult to justify. As long as the movement was confined\r\nto the Uitlanders resident in the Transvaal the sympathy of South\r\nAfrica and indeed of the world was with them. It was the alliance\r\nwith the foreign invader which forfeited that sympathy. That the\r\neventual intention of the Reformers was only to call upon Dr. Jameson\r\nin case they found themselves attacked by and unable to cope with the\r\nBoers is a fact, but it is only fair to Dr. Jameson to note that this\r\nwas a modification of the original arrangement by which both forces\r\nwere to act simultaneously and in concert,--when the signal should be\r\ngiven from Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Dr. Jameson's second visit to Johannesburg,\r\ntowards the end of November, the following letter of invitation was\r\nwritten and handed to him:\r\n\r\n_To Dr. Jameson._\r\n\r\n  JOHANNESBURG.{19}\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe position of matters in this State has become so critical that we\r\nare assured that at no distant period there will be a conflict\r\nbetween the Government and the Uitlander population. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary for us to recapitulate what is now matter of history;\r\nsuffice it to say that the position of thousands of Englishmen and\r\nothers is rapidly becoming intolerable. Not satisfied with making the\r\nUitlander population pay virtually the whole of the revenue of the\r\ncountry while denying them representation, the policy of the\r\nGovernment has been steadily to encroach upon the liberty of the\r\nsubject, and to undermine the security for property to such an extent\r\nas to cause a very deep-seated sense of discontent and danger. A\r\nforeign corporation of Hollanders is to a considerable extent\r\ncontrolling our destinies, and in conjunction with the Boer leaders\r\nendeavouring to cast them in a mould which is wholly foreign to the\r\ngenius of the people. Every public act betrays the most positive\r\nhostility, not only to everything English, but to the neighbouring\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWell in short the internal policy of the Government is such as to\r\nhave roused into antagonism to it, not only practically the whole\r\nbody of Uitlanders but a large number of the Boers; while its\r\nexternal policy has exasperated the neighbouring States, causing the\r\npossibility of great danger to the peace and independence of this\r\nRepublic. Public feeling is in a condition of smouldering discontent.\r\nAll the petitions of the people have been refused with a greater or\r\nless degree of contempt; and in the debate on the Franchise petition,\r\nsigned by nearly 40,000 people, one member challenged the\r\nUitlanders to fight for the rights they asked for, and not a single\r\nmember spoke against him. Not to go into details, we may say that the\r\nGovernment has called into existence all the elements necessary for\r\narmed conflict. The one desire of the people here is for fair play,\r\nthe maintenance of their independence, and the preservation of\r\nthose public liberties without which life is not worth living. The\r\nGovernment denies these things, and violates the national sense of\r\nEnglishmen at every turn.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to consider is, What will be the condition of things\r\nhere in the event of a conflict? Thousands of unarmed men, women and\r\nchildren of our race will be at the mercy of well-armed Boers, while\r\nproperty of enormous value will be in the greatest peril. We cannot\r\ncontemplate the future without the gravest apprehensions. All feel\r\nthat we are justified in taking any steps to prevent the shedding of\r\nblood, and to insure the protection of our rights.\r\n\r\nIt is under these circumstances that we feel constrained to call upon\r\nyou to come to our aid,{20} should a disturbance arise here. The\r\ncircumstances are so extreme that we cannot but believe that you and\r\nthe men under you will not fail to come to the rescue of people who\r\nwill be so situated. We guarantee any expense that may reasonably be\r\nincurred by you in helping us, and ask you to believe that nothing\r\nbut the sternest necessity has prompted this appeal.\r\n\r\n  CHARLES LEONARD.\r\n  LIONEL PHILLIPS.\r\n  FRANCIS RHODES.\r\n  JOHN HAYS HAMMOND.\r\n  GEORGE FARRAR.\r\n\r\nThe letter was drafted by Mr. Charles Leonard, and was signed then by\r\nfour out of the five signatories, the fifth signature being added\r\nsome weeks later in Cape Town. It was not dated, and was to be used\r\nonly privately and in case of necessity for the purpose of excusing\r\nDr. Jameson to the directors of the Chartered Company and the\r\nImperial authorities in the course which it was intended to take.\r\n\r\nVarious plans were discussed, and even dates were provisionally\r\narranged. The first arrangement agreed to was that Dr. Jameson should\r\nstart two days before the intended outbreak in Johannesburg. This\r\nwas agreed to for the time being, but subsequent discussion convinced\r\nthe leaders that there were the gravest objections to such a course,\r\nand it was therefore decided that Dr. Jameson should be notified\r\nto start from his camp on the same night as the outbreak in\r\nJohannesburg. The dates of December 28 and January 4 were in turn\r\nprovisionally decided upon, but the primary condition of these\r\narrangements was that under no circumstances should Dr. Jameson move\r\nwithout receiving the word from the Johannesburg party.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the question of going out to meet Dr. Jameson or\r\ngiving him assistance, the only thing that was discussed was that an\r\nofficers' patrol should be sent out to meet him, to escort him to his\r\ncamp. There was no doubt entertained as to the ability of Dr. Jameson\r\nand the force which it was believed he would command to come in\r\nwithout assistance or the arrangement would never have been made. The\r\nidea of the association with him was, of course, that he should\r\nassist the Reformers--not they assist him; and the proposal regarding\r\nthe officers' patrol was one to which he only consented after\r\nscouting the notion of any co-operation.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks which followed the conclusion of the arrangement\r\nconsiderable dissatisfaction was felt at the very slow progress made\r\nin obtaining arms. The number originally agreed to was deemed to be\r\nsufficient but no more; and when it was first found that it would not\r\nbe possible to obtain this number but that a few hundreds less would\r\nhave to be accepted, doubts were freely expressed as to the wisdom of\r\nproceeding until a sufficient supply had been obtained. When on two\r\nsubsequent occasions it was again notified that still a few hundred\r\nless would have to be accepted, some members of the Reform Party were\r\nvery emphatic in their objections to proceeding any further until\r\nthey should be satisfied that the undertakings upon the strength of\r\nwhich they had entered upon the arrangement would be faithfully\r\nadhered to. On the occasion of Dr. Jameson's last visit it had been\r\nextracted from him that instead of 1,500 men he would probably start\r\nwith from 800 to 1,000. These discrepancies and alterations caused\r\nthe liveliest dissatisfaction in the minds of those who realized\r\nthat they were entering upon a very serious undertaking; but although\r\nthe equipment seemed poor, reliance was always placed on the taking\r\nof Pretoria Fort. That at any rate was a certainty, and it would\r\nsettle the whole thing without a blow; for Johannesburg would have\r\neverything, and the Boers would have rifles, but neither ammunition\r\nnor field-guns. Without doubt the Pretoria arsenal was the key of the\r\nposition, and it is admitted by Boer and alien alike that it lay\r\nthere unguarded, ready to be picked up, and that nothing in the world\r\ncould have saved it--except what did!\r\n\r\nOn or about December 19, Messrs. Woolls-Sampson and A. Bailey, two\r\nJohannesburg men concerned in the movement, who had been in\r\ncommunication with Mr. Rhodes and others in Cape Town, arrived in\r\nJohannesburg, and indicated clearly that the question as to which\r\nflag was to be raised was either deemed to be a relatively\r\nunimportant one or one concerning which some of the parties had not\r\nclearly and honestly expressed their intentions. In simple truth, it\r\nappeared to be the case that Dr. Jameson either thought that the\r\nJohannesburg reformers were quite indifferent on the subject of the\r\nflag, or assumed that the provisions for the maintenance of the\r\nTransvaal flag were merely talk, and that the Union Jack would be\r\nhoisted at once. Nothing was further from the truth. The Reform Party\r\nin Johannesburg included men to whom the Union Jack is as dear as\r\ntheir own heart's blood, but it also included many others to whom\r\nthat flag does not appeal--men of other nationalities and other\r\nassociations and other sympathies. It included--perhaps the strongest\r\nelement of all--those men whose sympathies were naturally and most\r\nstrongly all for British rule, which they believed to be the best in\r\nthe world, but whose judgment showed them that to proclaim that rule\r\nwould be to defeat the very objects they honestly had in view, and\r\nwho would have regarded the change of flag at the last moment as an\r\nunprincipled deception of those comrades who had been induced to\r\nco-operate for reform and not for annexation. It had been repeatedly\r\nand emphatically stated that the object was not to deprive the Boer\r\nof his independence or the State of its autonomy, but to alter the\r\nsystem of government in such a way as, first to obtain betterment of\r\nthe economic conditions which affect everyone, and afterwards to\r\ninduce a policy more in accordance with the general South African\r\nsentiment--in fact to get the Transvaal into line with the other\r\nSouth African States, in the same way for instance as the Free State\r\nhad shown itself disposed to go. It is but poor work explaining\r\nfailure, yet it must surely be permissible that something should\r\nbe said for those who alone have had no hearing yet. And it is in\r\nthe minds of the Reformers that the professions of their 'real\r\nintentions' regarding the flag made by Dr. Jameson and Mr. Rhodes\r\nmight appropriately have been made before the raid, instead of\r\nafterwards when all was over. The regard for definite pledges, which\r\nin the Reformers was described as merely an excuse for backing out,\r\nwould, if it had been observed by all, have made a sickening fiasco\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had a doubt been raised on the subject of the flag than a\r\ntrusted emissary was despatched to inquire from Mr. Rhodes the\r\nmeaning of this tampering with one of the fundamental conditions of\r\nthe agreement. The messenger returned on Christmas morning, and at a\r\nlargely-attended meeting of the ringleaders stated that he had seen\r\nMr. Rhodes, and had received from him the assurance that it was all\r\nright about the flag: no question or doubt had been raised on the\r\nsubject. In returning to Capetown however in company with Dr.\r\nRutherfoord Harris, he learned from that gentleman that it was by no\r\nmeans all right, and gathered that it was assumed that the provision\r\nabout maintaining the Transvaal flag was so much talk necessary to\r\nsecure the adhesion of some doubtful people. The announcement was\r\nreceived with the gravest dissatisfaction. Several of the leading men\r\nstated emphatically that nothing would induce them to take part in\r\nthe movement unless the original arrangement was loyally adhered to.\r\nIn consequence of this it was resolved to despatch Messrs. Charles\r\nLeonard and F.H. Hamilton to see Mr. Rhodes and to obtain from him a\r\ndefinite guarantee that in the event of their availing themselves of\r\nDr. Jameson's help under any conditions the latter would abide by the\r\narrangements agreed upon.\r\n\r\nIt was then thought that a week would be sufficient time in which to\r\nclear up the flag question and complete preparations. It was\r\ndecided to call a big public meeting for the night of Monday, January\r\n6, not with the intention of holding the meeting, but as a blind to\r\ncover the simultaneous rising in Johannesburg and seizing of the\r\narsenal in Pretoria on the night of Saturday, January 4. With this in\r\nmind it was arranged to publish, in the form of a manifesto,{21} the\r\naddress which Mr. Charles Leonard had prepared for the meeting.\r\n\r\nAmong the Reformers there had always been a considerable section who\r\nregarded the alliance or arrangement with Dr. Jameson as a very\r\ndoubtful advantage. It was this section which strongly and\r\nsuccessfully opposed the suggestion that he should start before an\r\nactual outbreak. The difference of opinion was not such as to cause\r\ndivision in the ranks, but yet sufficient to keep alive discussion as\r\nto how the common aim could be achieved without risk of the\r\ncomplications which external aid in the initial stages would be sure\r\nto cause. To this feeling of doubt was added a sense of distrust when\r\nDr. Jameson's importunity and impatience became known; and when the\r\nquestion of the flag was raised there were few, if any, among those\r\nconcerned in the movement who did not feel that the tail was trying\r\nto wag the dog. The feeling was so strong that many were prepared to\r\nabandon the whole scheme and start _de novo_ rather than continue an\r\nundertaking in which it looked as though they were being fooled.\r\nHence the despatch of Messrs. Leonard and Hamilton on Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nConfidence in their power to control Dr. Jameson and direct the\r\nmovement, as they considered they had the right and ability to do,\r\nhad been so shaken in the reformers that as soon as Messrs. Leonard\r\nand Hamilton had been sent they began to discuss a complete change of\r\nplans, and awaited only the reply from Capetown before taking the\r\nfirst steps in the prosecution of the new programme. The plan most\r\nfavoured was that the importation and distribution of arms should be\r\ncontinued as speedily and as secretly as possible, that, instead of\r\nan invading force, as many armed and trained men as could be obtained\r\nshould be brought in, nominally as mechanics or men seeking\r\nemployment on the mines, that the public meeting called for\r\nJanuary 6 should be held and made as large and demonstrative as\r\npossible, and a demand made to the Volksraad to grant the redress of\r\nthe grievances complained of, and, failing reasonable concessions,\r\nthat they should rise in arms and at the same time appeal to England,\r\nas the paramount Power, or to the other South African Governments,\r\nto mediate and so avert civil war. It was believed, and with much\r\nreason, that the Boers, knowing, as they then inevitably would, that\r\na considerable quantity of arms and ammunition had been smuggled in,\r\nand knowing also that the sentiment of South Africa, including the\r\nFree State, was all in favour of considerable concessions to the\r\nUitlanders, would have hesitated to take the initiative against\r\nJohannesburg, and would either have yielded to the pressure of the\r\ngeneral South African opinion and have accepted the mediation of the\r\nHigh Commissioner, or would have offered considerable reforms. The\r\nKruger party, it was well known, would proceed to any extreme rather\r\nthan concede anything to the Uitlanders; but at that time the\r\nmajority of the Boers were opposed to the Kruger policy of favouring\r\nthe Hollanders and Germans to the exclusion of all other Uitlanders,\r\nand this majority would not have consented to measures calculated to\r\nembroil them with the people who had made their country prosperous,\r\nand even to imperil the very existence of the State, whilst an\r\nalternative course so easy as the one presented lay open to them.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the despatch of Messrs. Leonard and Hamilton to\r\nCapetown it was decided to send messengers to Dr. Jameson to\r\nemphatically prohibit any movement on his part, also to explain to\r\nhim the position of affairs in Johannesburg with reference to the\r\nflag, and above all to impress upon him the condition of\r\nunpreparedness. Major Heany was sent by train viâ Kimberley, and in\r\norder to facilitate his travelling a telegram was sent to Mr. Rhodes\r\nin Capetown asking him to arrange for a special train, and\r\nacquainting him with the purpose of the trip. Captain Holden was sent\r\non horseback across country to Pitsani. Both gentlemen carried the\r\nmost definite instructions to Dr. Jameson on no account to move. Both\r\ngentlemen have since stated that they delivered the messages in\r\nword and in spirit absolutely as they were given to them in\r\nJohannesburg, and that they carried no private messages whatever from\r\nany individual member of the Committee in any way conflicting with\r\nthe purport of the official message with which they were charged.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday telegrams and messages were\r\nreceived from Dr. Jameson, all revealing impatience and a desire if\r\nnot an intention to disregard the wishes of the Johannesburg people.\r\nReplies were sent to him and to the Capetown agents protesting\r\nagainst the tone adopted, urging him to desist from the endeavour to\r\nrush the Johannesburg people as they were pushing matters on to the\r\nbest of their ability and hoped for a successful issue without\r\nrecourse to violent measures, and stating emphatically that the\r\ndecision must be left entirely in the hands of Johannesburg as\r\nagreed, otherwise there would be certain disaster. Besides what would\r\nbe regarded as the official expressions and messages of the\r\nJohannesburg people, several individual members of the party\r\ntelegraphed to Dr. Jameson informing him of the position and adding\r\ntheir personal advice and testimony. The probability of achieving\r\nsuccess without firing a shot was referred to in the sense of a most\r\nsatisfactory prospect. It did not occur to any one among the\r\nJohannesburg party that it was this prospect that moved Dr. Jameson\r\nto start. That idea is of later birth.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, at about ten o'clock, two telegrams of importance\r\nwere received. The first was from Messrs. Hamilton and Leonard, to\r\nthe following effect: 'We have received perfectly satisfactory\r\nassurance from Cecil Rhodes, but a misunderstanding undoubtedly\r\nexists elsewhere. In our opinion, continue preparations, but\r\ncarefully, and without any sort of hurry, as entirely fresh departure\r\nwill be necessary. In view of changed condition Jameson has been\r\nadvised accordingly.' Portions of this message were in code. It left\r\nCapetown at 2.20 p.m. on Saturday, the 28th, and was received on\r\nSunday at about ten o'clock. The second telegram was one from Dr.\r\nJameson to his brother, Mr. S.W. Jameson, and had been despatched at\r\nabout the same time. It was in the Bedford-McNeil Code, and was much\r\nmutilated--so much so that it was thought to have been purposely\r\ndone in the telegraph office in order to obscure the meaning. One\r\nexpression was clear, however, and that was: 'I shall start without\r\nfail to-morrow night.' It concluded with the words: 'Inform Dr.\r\nWolff--distant cutting. He will understand.'\r\n\r\nThe words 'distant cutting' did not occur in any code-book. Dr.\r\nJameson states that they were words privately agreed upon between him\r\nand Dr. Wolff. The telegram was shown to Dr. Wolff as soon as he\r\ncould be found, but he declared himself unable to throw any light\r\nwhatever upon it. It was however clear from the message that on\r\nSaturday afternoon it had been Dr. Jameson's intention to disregard\r\nthe wishes of the Committee, and to start on Sunday night, and the\r\ntelegram impressed the recipients more than ever with the wisdom of\r\ntheir action in sending the messengers to Capetown and to Pitsani to\r\ninsist upon no further steps being taken. It is of little consequence\r\nwhat the words 'distant cutting' really meant, or whether they were,\r\nor should have been, understood by any of the parties. Major Heany\r\nand Captain Holden, it was known, could not have reached Dr. Jameson\r\nat the time the message was despatched, and therefore no more\r\nimportance was attached to this than to the other impatient\r\ntelegrams.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that, on receiving the emphatic messages sent through\r\nMajor Heany and Captain Holden, Dr. Jameson would realize the\r\nseriousness of the position, and would, in fact, abide by the\r\narrangements made with him. Nor was this all. It was also clear that\r\nthe telegram of Mr. Rhodes to which it was inferred reference was\r\nmade in the concluding words of Messrs. Hamilton's and Leonard's\r\nwire--'Jameson has been advised accordingly'--could not have reached\r\nDr. Jameson at the time his telegram to his brother was despatched.\r\nIt was part of the instructions to Messrs. Hamilton and Leonard that\r\nany communications which they might desire to make to Dr. Jameson\r\nshould pass through Mr. Cecil Rhodes in order to ensure due regard\r\nbeing paid to them. There was therefore no doubt in the minds of the\r\nJohannesburg men that during Saturday afternoon--that is to say, more\r\nthan twenty-four hours before he proposed moving--he must have\r\nreceived a wire forbidding him to move.\r\n\r\nThe facts here given were sufficient to warrant the belief that all\r\nthat was necessary had been done to prevent any movement. But more\r\nreassuring than all precautions was the conviction that Dr. Jameson,\r\nno matter how much he might 'bluff' in order to force immediate\r\naction, would never be guilty of so gross a breach of faith as to\r\nstart in defiance of the wishes of the Johannesburg people. Extreme\r\ndissatisfaction of course prevailed in the minds of a good many when\r\nthey learned of the efforts made by him to force their hands, and\r\nthis feeling was intensified by the report brought in by Dr. Wolff,\r\nwho had just returned from seeing Dr. Jameson at Pitsani. Dr. Wolff\r\nhad arrived at Pitsani on the previous Tuesday, and was then greeted\r\nby Dr. Jameson with the remark that he had 'as nearly as possible\r\nstarted for Pretoria last night.' It was felt that this might appear\r\nto be a very fine and dashing thing for a party of men well armed and\r\ntrained and able to take care of themselves, but that it betrayed\r\ngreat indifference to his pledges, as well as to the fate of his\r\nassociates, who as he knew perfectly well had not even the arms to\r\ndefend themselves from the consequences of any precipitate action on\r\nhis part, and who had moreover the responsibility for the control and\r\nprotection of unarmed Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nThe feeling among the Reformers on Sunday, the 29th, was one of\r\nconsiderable relief at having found out in time the intention of\r\ntheir reckless colleague, and at having taken the necessary steps to\r\ncontrol him. Secure in the belief that the messages from Capetown had\r\nduly reached Dr. Jameson, and that either Major Heany or Captain\r\nHolden had by that time also reached him, and that in the future the\r\nmanagement of their affairs would be left in their own hands, they\r\ncontinued during Sunday and Monday, the 29th and 30th, to arrange\r\nplans on the basis before indicated, awaiting in the meantime further\r\ncommunications from Messrs. Hamilton and Leonard.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile it became generally known in Johannesburg that some\r\nmovement was afoot, and suppressed excitement and expectancy became\r\neverywhere manifest. On Saturday, December 28, the President returned\r\nfrom his annual tour through certain of the outlying districts. On\r\nhis journey he was met by a number of burghers at Bronkhorst\r\nSpruit, the scene of the battle in the War of Independence, about\r\ntwenty miles from Pretoria. One of the burghers, an old Boer named\r\nHans Botha, who was the opponent of Mr. Woolls-Sampson in the 'duel'\r\nat the battle of Zwartkoppies, in addressing the President, said that\r\nhe had heard that there was some talk of a rising in Johannesburg,\r\nand added that although he had many bullets in him (It is stated that\r\nhe still has five!), he could find room for more if it was a question\r\nof tackling the Britishers. The President replied that he had heard\r\nof the threatened rising, and did not believe it: he could not say\r\nwhat was likely to happen, but they must remember this--if they\r\nwanted to kill a tortoise they must wait until he put his head out of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with a representative of the press immediately after\r\nthis the President said that the position was full of gravity and\r\nmight lead to disagreeable consequences, especially to the mining\r\nindustry and commercial enterprise generally; but he was still\r\nconfident that common-sense would prevail in Johannesburg, and\r\nexpressed the conviction that the law-abiding portion of the\r\ncommunity, which included the greater part of the English and other\r\nnationalities, would support all measures for the preservation of law\r\nand order. He said that his endeavours hitherto to secure concessions\r\nfor the Uitlander population had been frustrated by the public\r\nutterances and actions of irresponsible and unscrupulous agitators\r\nwhose methods had often a detrimental effect on the Volksraad and on\r\nthe burghers throughout the Republic. The first commotion created was\r\nby the flag incident some years before (1890), which caused a great\r\nshock to confidence; another sinister incident was the refusal of a\r\nportion of the British community to serve their adopted country in\r\nthe Malaboch War, when the union of Boer and Briton against the\r\ncommon enemy was nearly brought about. 'If wiser counsels\r\nunfortunately should not prevail,' the President continued, 'then let\r\nthe storm arise, and the wind thereof will separate the chaff from\r\nthe grain. The Government will give every opportunity for free speech\r\nand free ventilation of grievances, but it is fully prepared to put a\r\nstop to any movement made for the upsetting of law and order.'\r\n\r\nOn the same day the President was interviewed by a deputation of\r\nAmericans from Johannesburg. They were men of the highest position\r\nand influence in the community and were earnestly desirous of\r\nsecuring reforms, but they were impressed with the idea that peaceful\r\nmeans had not yet been exhausted and that the President and his\r\nExecutive would listen to reason if they were convinced that serious\r\nconsequences would follow the neglect to reform. The President\r\nreceived them civilly, as he often does when he has a strong hand to\r\nplay: it is generally when his cards are poor that he gives way to\r\nthe paroxysms of rage and indulges in the personal abuse and violent\r\nbehaviour which have earned for him so unenviable a reputation. He\r\nlistened to all that had been advanced by the deputation, and then\r\nsaid that 'it was no time to talk when danger was at hand. That was\r\nthe time for action.' The deputation represented to him that there\r\nwas no danger at hand unless the President by his own act\r\nprecipitated matters and caused the trouble himself, that matters\r\nwere completely in his hands, and that if he would deal with the\r\npeople in a liberal and statesmanlike way and grant the reforms which\r\nwere universally acknowledged to be necessary there would not be\r\nanywhere in the world a more law-abiding and loyal community than\r\nthat of Johannesburg. The President answered merely by the question:\r\n'If a crisis should occur, on which side shall I find the Americans?'\r\nThe answer was, 'On the side of liberty and good government.' The\r\nPresident replied, 'You are all alike, tarred with the same brush;\r\nyou are British in your hearts.'\r\n\r\nIn reply to another deputation, representing a section of the\r\ncommunity which was not by any means at one with the reformers, but\r\nthe leading members of which still urged the necessity for reforms,\r\nthe President said, 'Either you are with me in the last extremity or\r\nyou are with the enemy; choose which course you will adopt. Call a\r\nmeeting to repudiate the Manifesto in its entirety, or there is final\r\nrupture between us.' The gentlemen addressed declared emphatically\r\nthat on the Manifesto there could be no retreat. On that Johannesburg\r\nwas absolutely at one. The President replied, 'Then, I shall know how\r\nto deal with Johannesburg,' and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe various business associations of Johannesburg and Pretoria\r\napproached the President at different hours in these threatening\r\ntimes, and did all that was possible to induce him to make reasonable\r\nconcessions. Although numbers of his followers and counsellors were\r\nstrongly in favour of doing something to avert the coming storm, the\r\nPresident himself seemed inclined to fight until the last ditch was\r\nreached rather than concede anything. In reply to the Mercantile\r\nAssociation he said that he was quite willing to give the franchise,\r\nbut that it would be to those who were really worthy of it--those for\r\ninstance who rallied round the Government in this crisis and took\r\nno part in the mischievous agitation and clamouring for so-called\r\nreforms: all malcontents should be excluded. In fact he made it\r\nperfectly plain that the franchise would be treated as a huge bribery\r\nfund; and he himself was introducing the thin end of the wedge in\r\nthe suggestion made to the Association with a view to splitting\r\nup the Reform Party in Johannesburg. He however added that the\r\nspecial duties on food-stuffs would be immediately removed pending\r\nconfirmation by the Volksraad, that equal subsidies would be granted\r\nto Dutch and English schools alike, and that the Netherlands Railway\r\nCompany would be approached with a view to having the tariffs\r\nreduced. The effect of this was however slightly marred by the\r\nconcluding sentence in which he stated that 'as he had kept his\r\nformer promises, so he would do his best to keep this.'\r\n\r\nIn reply to a second deputation of Americans, the President in a\r\nmoment of irritation said that it was impossible to grant the\r\nfranchise to the Uitlander--American, British, or other; he would\r\nlose his power if he did; the Government would no longer be his. A\r\nmember of the deputation said, 'Surely, if we take the oath of\r\nallegiance, you will trust us?' The President hesitated for a moment,\r\nand then said, 'This is no time to talk about these things; I can\r\npromise you nothing.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter III\r\n\r\n{19} The date of 20th December, 1895, was filled in by Dr. Jameson\r\nwhen he decided to start and to publish the letter.\r\n\r\n{20} When this letter was published by Dr. Jameson and cabled to\r\nthe London _Times_ the sense of it was very gravely--but doubtless\r\nunintentionally--altered by terminating this sentence with the word\r\n'aid' and carrying the remaining words into the next sentence.\r\n\r\n(July, 1899.) At the Westminster inquiry it transpired that on\r\nDecember 20 Mr. Rhodes instructed Dr. Harris to wire for a copy of\r\nthe letter. Dr. Jameson forwarded it after filling in that day's\r\ndate. On December 30, Dr. Harris, again acting on Mr. Rhodes'\r\ninstructions, telegraphed the letter to the _Times_, having altered\r\nthe date to 28th, and prefaced it with the statement that the letter\r\nhad been 'sent on Saturday (28) to Dr. Jameson, Mafeking.'\r\n\r\n{21} See Appendix I. for the full text of Manifesto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning Mr. S.W. Jameson (a brother of Dr. Jameson, who,\r\nalthough suffering acutely from rheumatic fever, insisted on taking\r\nhis share of the work and worry during the days that followed)\r\nreceived a telegram addressed to Dr. Wolff, in his care. The latter\r\nbeing away on Monday Mr. Jameson translated the telegram and showed\r\nit at once to as many of his comrades as he could find. It was from\r\nDr. Jameson, despatched from Pitsani at 9.5 a.m. on Sunday, and ran\r\nas follows: 'Meet me as arranged before you left on Tuesday night\r\nwhich will enable us to decide which is best destination. Make\r\nAdvocate Leonard speak--make cutting to-night without fail.'\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to find Dr. Wolff, but he--in common with\r\nothers--believing that there would be no move for a week, was away.\r\nThis telegram was, to say the least of it, disquieting. It showed, so\r\nit was thought, that as late as Sunday morning Dr. Jameson could not\r\nhave received the countermands by Messrs. Heany and Holden, and it\r\nindicated that it must have been a near thing stopping him before he\r\nactually crossed the border. As a matter of fact Major Heany reached\r\nDr. Jameson at noon on Sunday; but Capt. Holden had arrived the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon Mr. Abe Bailey received and showed to others a\r\ntelegram purporting to come from 'Godolphin,' Capetown, to the\r\nfollowing effect: 'The veterinary surgeon says the horses are now all\r\nright; he started with them last night; will reach you on Wednesday;\r\nhe says he can back himself for seven hundred.' By the light of\r\nsubsequent events the telegram is easily interpreted, but as Mr.\r\nBailey said he could not even guess who 'Godolphin' might be, the\r\nmessage remained a puzzle. That it had some reference to Dr. Jameson\r\nwas at once guessed, indeed Mr. Bailey would not have shown it to\r\nothers concerned in the movement did he not himself think so. The\r\nimportance and significance of the message entirely depended upon who\r\n'Godolphin' was, and it afterwards transpired that the sender was Dr.\r\nRutherfoord Harris, who states that he took the first and safest\r\nmeans of conveying the news that Dr. Jameson had actually started in\r\nspite of all. Mysterious and unintelligible as it was the telegram\r\ncaused the greatest uneasiness among the few who saw it, for it\r\nseemed to show that an unknown someone in Capetown was under the\r\nimpression that Dr. Jameson had started. The Reformers however still\r\nrejected the idea that he would do anything so mad and preposterous,\r\nand above all they were convinced that had he started they would not\r\nbe left to gather the fact from the ambiguous phrases of an unknown\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nAll doubts however were set at rest when between four and half-past\r\nfour on Monday afternoon Mr. A.L. Lawley came hurriedly into the room\r\nwhere several of the leaders were met, saying, 'It is all up, boys.\r\nHe has started in spite of everything. Read this!' and at the same\r\ntime throwing on the table the following telegram from Mafeking: 'The\r\ncontractor has started on the earthworks with seven hundred boys;\r\nhopes to reach terminus on Wednesday.'\r\n\r\nThe Reformers realized perfectly well the full significance of Dr.\r\nJameson's action; they realized that even if he succeeded in reaching\r\nJohannesburg, he, by taking the initiative, seriously impaired the\r\njustice of the Uitlanders' cause--indeed, put them hopelessly in the\r\nwrong. Apart from the moral or political aspects of the question\r\nthere was the fact that, either through mistake or by fatuous\r\nimpulse, Dr. Jameson had plunged them into a crisis for which as he\r\nknew they were insufficiently provided and prepared, and at the same\r\ntime destroyed the one chance--the one certainty--on which they had\r\nalways counted for arms and ammunition; by starting first he knocked\r\nout the foundation of the whole scheme--he made the taking of the\r\nPretoria arsenal impossible. For a few minutes it was hoped that\r\nthe chance of taking the arsenal still remained; but while discussion\r\nwas still proceeding and several of those present were protesting\r\nthat the news could not be true (among them Mr. S.W. Jameson, who\r\nstoutly maintained that his brother would never start in defiance of\r\nhis pledges), authentic news of the invasion was received from the\r\nGovernment offices; and this was supplemented a few minutes later by\r\nthe information that the Government had known it at an early hour in\r\nthe morning, and that Pretoria was then full of armed burghers. The\r\nposition then appeared fairly desperate.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that even when Dr. Jameson decided to start in\r\nopposition to the Committee's wishes it was not deemed necessary to\r\ntreat them with the candour which they were entitled to expect from a\r\ncomrade. It is well known that Dr. Jameson never had 700 men, and\r\nthat he started with less than 500, and yet the Reformers were led to\r\nunderstand from the telegrams above quoted that he was starting with\r\n700, and not 800 as last promised. They were at first under the\r\nimpression that the 700 men did not include the Bechuanaland Border\r\nPolice who were to join him after starting, so that it was still\r\nthought that he had over 800 men.\r\n\r\nBefore five o'clock messengers had been sent out in all directions to\r\ncall together those who had interested themselves in the movement, or\r\nas many of them as possible, for several prominent men knowing only\r\nof the steps taken to prevent any movement on the part of Dr.\r\nJameson, were not at hand. As many as possible however gathered\r\ntogether, and it was decided to take instant steps to put the town in\r\na state of defence. In order that the subsequent actions and attitude\r\nof the Reform Committee may be properly understood it is necessary to\r\nexplain somewhat fully the position of affairs on this Monday\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was realized that the news was beyond all doubt true\r\nthe bitterest censure was expressed upon Dr. Jameson's action, and it\r\nwas at first stated by many that either Dr. Jameson or Mr. Rhodes or\r\nboth had deliberately and for the furtherance of their personal aims\r\ndisregarded in treacherous and heartless fashion all their\r\nagreements. Soon however a calmer view was taken, and a consideration\r\nof all the circumstances induced the Reformers to believe that Dr.\r\nJameson had started in good faith, but under some misapprehension.\r\nThey recalled the various reports that had been in circulation in the\r\npress about conflicts between the Boers and Uitlanders at the Simmer\r\nand Jack and Jumpers mines, the reported arrest of Mr. Lionel\r\nPhillips and the demand of £80,000 bail--rumours which had been\r\ntreated by those on the spot as too ridiculous to gain credence\r\nanywhere, but which they nevertheless thought might have reached Dr.\r\nJameson in such guise as to induce him to take the step which he had\r\ntaken. It was assumed that the telegrams sent from Johannesburg and\r\nCapetown to stop him had not reached him, and that Messrs. Heany and\r\nHolden had also failed to catch him before he started. Opinions\r\nhowever were still divided as to whether he had simply lost patience\r\nand come in regardless of all consequences, or had been really misled\r\nand had dashed in to the assistance of Johannesburg. The position was\r\nat best one of horrible uncertainty, and divided as the Committee\r\nwere in their opinions as to his motive they could only give him the\r\nbenefit of the doubt and assume that there was behind his action no\r\npersonal aim and no deliberate disregard of his undertakings. In\r\norder to realize the perplexity of the position it must be understood\r\nthat only the few who happened to meet on Sunday and Monday morning\r\nknew of the telegrams which had passed during the previous\r\ntwenty-four hours, many did not know of them until Pretoria prison\r\ngave them time to compare notes; to some they may be news even now.\r\nThere was no time to argue then!\r\n\r\nKnowing the poorness of the equipment of Johannesburg and the\r\nunpreparedness of the place and its inhabitants the more logical and\r\ncold-blooded course would have been to repudiate Dr. Jameson\r\ninstantly and to have left him to his fate; but against this was\r\nfirstly, the fact publicly admitted that he had remained on the\r\nborder by arrangement with the leaders in order to help them should\r\nthe necessity arise; next, that if he gave heed to the reports which\r\nwere being circulated he might have thought that the necessity had\r\narisen; and finally, that the leaders had taken such steps in the\r\nsmuggling in of arms and the arming of men as would warrant the\r\nBoers, and indeed anybody else, in associating them with Dr. Jameson,\r\nso that they might confidently expect to be attacked as accomplices\r\nbefore the true facts could become known. They realized quite well\r\nthat they had a big responsibility to the unarmed population of\r\nJohannesburg, and it was with the object of fulfilling that\r\nobligation that they decided to arm as many men as possible and to\r\nfortify and defend the place if attacked, but, in view of the\r\nimpossibility of aggressive measures being successful, to take no\r\ninitiative against the Boers. It would in any case have been entirely\r\nuseless to suggest the repudiation of Dr. Jameson at that moment. The\r\nJohannesburg people would never have listened to such a suggestion,\r\nnor could anyone have been found to make it.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the Reform Committee have been charged with\r\nthe crime of plunging the country into civil war with a miserable\r\nequipment of less than 3,000 rifles, it is only fair to give some\r\nheed to the conditions as they were at the time and to consider\r\nwhether any other course would have been practicable, and if\r\npracticable, whether it would have been in the interests of any\r\nconsiderable section of the community. To the Committee the course to\r\nbe taken seemed perfectly clear. They determined to defend and hold\r\nthe town. They threw off all disguise, got in all the arms they\r\npossibly could, organized the various military corps, and made\r\narrangements for the maintenance of order in the town and on the\r\nmines. Throughout Monday night all were engaged in getting in arms\r\nand ammunition and doing all that could be done to enable the town to\r\nhold its own against possible attack.\r\n\r\nDuring Monday night the Reform Committee came into existence. Those\r\nwho had so far taken a prominent part in the agitation had been for\r\nconvenience utilizing Colonel Rhodes' office in the Consolidated\r\nGoldfields Company's building. Many prominent men came forward\r\nvoluntarily to associate themselves with the movement, and as the\r\nnumbers increased and work had to be apportioned it became evident\r\nthat some organization would be necessary. Those who had already\r\ntaken part in the movement formed themselves into a committee, and\r\nmany other prominent men joined immediately. The movement being an\r\nentirely public one it was open for anyone to join provided he\r\ncould secure the approval of the already elected members. The body so\r\nconstituted was then called the Reform Committee.\r\n\r\nThe following is the first notice of the Reform Committee as\r\npublished in the _Johannesburg Star_; and it indicates the position\r\ntaken up:\r\n\r\nNotice is hereby given that this Committee adheres to the National\r\nUnion manifesto, and reiterates its desire to maintain the\r\nindependence of the Republic. The fact that rumours are in course of\r\ncirculation to the effect that a force has crossed the Bechuanaland\r\nborder renders it necessary to take active steps for the defence of\r\nJohannesburg and the preservation of order. The Committee earnestly\r\ndesires that the inhabitants should refrain from taking any action\r\nwhich can be considered as an overt act of hostility against the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nTelegrams were sent to the High Commissioner and to the Premier of\r\nCape Colony informing them that owing to the starting of Dr. Jameson\r\nwith an armed force into the Transvaal Johannesburg had been placed\r\nin a position of extreme peril which they were utterly unprepared to\r\nguard against, and urging the High Commissioner to proceed\r\nimmediately to Johannesburg in order to settle matters and prevent a\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nSub-committees were at once appointed, partly chosen from members of\r\nthe Reform Committee and partly from others who had interested\r\nthemselves in the movement and had come forward to take part but had\r\nnot actually joined the controlling body. The matters to be dealt\r\nwith were: The policing of the town; the control of the natives\r\nthrown out of employment by the closing of the mines; the\r\narrangements for the defence of the town; the commissariat for the\r\nmen bearing arms and for others who were flocking into the town; the\r\nproviding for the women and children who had been brought in from the\r\nmines and had neither food nor shelter. These matters were taken in\r\nhand on Tuesday morning, and before nightfall some 2,000 men had been\r\nsupplied with arms; the Maxims had been brought in and placed in\r\nposition on the hills surrounding the town; various corps had been\r\nformed; a commencement had been made in the throwing-up of earthworks\r\naround the town; and food-supplies and such field equipment as could\r\nbe got together had been provided for the men. As regards the town,\r\nthe Government police having disappeared, it was necessary to take\r\nenergetic steps to prevent actual chaos reigning. Ex-Chief Detective\r\nTrimble was appointed to organize a police force, and the work was\r\nadmirably done. Before nightfall the Reform Committee's police had\r\ntaken entire charge of the town, and from this time until the\r\nwithdrawal of the Committee's police after the laying down of arms,\r\nperfect order was maintained--indeed, the town has never before or\r\nsince been so efficiently controlled as during this period.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the mines stopped work. In some cases the miners remained\r\nto protect the companies' property; in other cases the men came in\r\nand volunteered to carry arms in defence of the town. One of the most\r\nserious difficulties with which the Committee had to deal was that of\r\nsupplying arms. There were under 3,000 rifles, and during the few\r\ndays when the excitement was at its highest no less than 20,000 men\r\ncame forward as volunteers and demanded to be armed. Not unnaturally\r\na great deal of feeling was roused among these men against the\r\nCommittee on account of their inability to arm them. It was believed\r\nfor a long time that the Committee was wholly responsible for the\r\nincursion by Dr. Jameson; that they had precipitated matters without\r\nregard to the safety of the unarmed population, and had actually\r\ncourted civil war with a paltry equipment of some 3,000 rifles. For\r\nseveral days a huge crowd surrounded the Committee's offices\r\nclamouring for guns. It is difficult to say what the feeling would\r\nhave been and what would have been done had it been known then that\r\nthere were less than 3,000 rifles. Not more than a dozen men knew the\r\nactual number, and they decided to take the responsibility of\r\nwithholding this information, for they realized that panic and riot\r\nmight ensue if it were known, whilst the only hope for a successful\r\nissue now lay in Johannesburg presenting a bold, confident, and\r\nunited front.\r\n\r\nAll the well-known medical men in the town came forward at once, and\r\norganized and equipped an ambulance corps which within the day was in\r\nperfect working order.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most arduous task of all was that of the Commissariat\r\nDepartment, who were called upon to supply at a few hours' notice the\r\nmen bearing arms in various positions outside the town and the\r\nvarious depots within the town which were organized for the relief\r\nof those who had flocked in unprovided for. It would have been\r\nimpossible, except in a community where the great majority of men had\r\nbeen trained by the nature of their own business in the habit of\r\norganization, to cope with the difficulties which here presented\r\nthemselves, and it is impossible to pay too high tribute to those who\r\norganized the relief of the women and children from the surrounding\r\ndistricts. Not less than 2,000 women and children were housed and fed\r\non Tuesday night; offices were taken possession of in different parts\r\nof the town and converted into barracks, where sleeping accommodation\r\nwas provided under excellent sanitary conditions; and abundance of\r\nfood, as good as could be expected at an ordinary hotel, was supplied\r\nto these people who had come in expecting to sleep in the streets.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry into effect the scheme of relief above referred to\r\nit was found necessary to form what was called the Relief Committee.\r\nA fund was opened to provide this Committee with the necessary means,\r\nand members of the Reform Committee subscribed upwards of £80,000\r\nwithin a few minutes of the opening of the lists.\r\n\r\nThe native liquor question also called for prompt and determined\r\nhandling. A deputation from the Committee called upon the Landdrost,\r\nthe official head of the Licensing Board, and requested the\r\nco-operation of the Government in dealing with this matter, and an\r\norder was obtained from him compulsorily closing the canteens until\r\nfurther notice. Armed with this the officials appointed by the\r\nCommittee visited the various liquor-houses along the mines and gave\r\ndue notice, with the further warning that if any breach of the new\r\nregulation took place it would be followed by the confiscation of the\r\nentire stock of liquor. The measure generally had a very salutary\r\neffect, but in the lowest quarters it was not sufficient. The\r\nCommittee had realized in the very beginning that nothing but the\r\nremoval of the liquor would prevent the Kaffir canteen-keepers from\r\nsupplying the natives with drink, and patrols were accordingly sent\r\nout to seize the entire stock in those drinking-hells, to pay\r\ncompensation at value agreed upon, and to destroy the liquor. The\r\nstep was no doubt a high-handed one, and before it was taken notice\r\nwas given to the Government officials of the intention. The Committee\r\nwere warned that this action could not be authorized by Government,\r\nas it was both high-handed and illegal, but they decided to take the\r\nresponsibility upon themselves. It is not too much to say that there\r\nwere fewer cases of drunkenness or violence reported during the\r\nperiod of trouble than during any other fortnight in the history of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThe following proclamation had been issued by the President at a very\r\nlate hour on Monday night in Pretoria, and was received in\r\nJohannesburg on Tuesday morning:\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION BY HIS HONOUR THE STATE PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN\r\nREPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has appeared to the Government of the South African\r\nRepublic that there are rumours in circulation to the effect that\r\nearnest endeavours are being made to endanger the public safety of\r\nJohannesburg, and whereas the Government is convinced that, in case\r\nsuch rumours may contain any truth, such endeavours can only emanate\r\nfrom a small portion of the inhabitants, and that the greater portion\r\nof the Johannesburg inhabitants are peaceful, and are prepared to\r\nsupport the Government in its endeavours to maintain law and order,\r\n\r\nNow, know you that I, Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, State\r\nPresident of the South African Republic, with the advice and consent\r\nof the Executive Council, according to Article 913 of its\r\nminutes, dated the 30th of December, 1895, do hereby warn those\r\nevil-intentioned persons (as I do hereby urge all such persons to do)\r\nto remain within the pale of the law, and all such persons not\r\nheeding this warning shall do so on their own responsibility; and I\r\ndo further make known that life and property shall be protected\r\nagainst which attempts may be made, and that every peaceful\r\ninhabitant of Johannesburg, of whatsoever nationality he may be, is\r\ncalled upon to support me herein, and to assist the officials charged\r\ntherewith; and further be it made known that the Government is still\r\nprepared to take into consideration all grievances that may be laid\r\nbefore it in a proper manner, and to submit the same to the people of\r\nthe land without delay for treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Government in Pretoria were no doubt perfectly well aware of all\r\nthat was going on; the Committee could not possibly observe any\r\nsecrecy, nor did it appear desirable, since the position taken up and\r\nmaintained by them to the end was that they were not responsible for\r\nDr. Jameson's incursion and were simply prepared to defend the town\r\nagainst attack.\r\n\r\nDuring the four or five days preceding this the evidences of\r\nexcitement in Johannesburg had been unmistakable, and on Saturday\r\nthe 28th, the day before Dr. Jameson started, several prominent\r\nofficials and two or three members of the Volksraad visited\r\nJohannesburg from Pretoria and openly discussed the seriousness\r\nof the position. At that time they were strongly of opinion that\r\nthe Government had brought the trouble on themselves by their\r\nwrong-headed and corrupt action. The visitors were men who although\r\nofficially associated with the Government were not at all in sympathy\r\nwith the policy of the Krugerite party, and they were sincerely\r\nanxious for a peaceful settlement and desirous of liberal reforms,\r\nbut their influence with the Government was nil. Unfortunately it has\r\nalways been the case that intelligent and upright men associated with\r\nthe Pretoria Government (and there are some as bright examples as can\r\nbe found in any country) never have, and never will have, any weight\r\nwith the party now dominating the State. Their services are not used\r\nas they might be, and their counsels are not regarded as they should\r\nbe in times when they would be of value; in fact, it would seem that\r\nthey are only used when it appears to Mr. Kruger and his party that\r\nthey present opportunities for playing upon the credulity of the\r\nUitlanders with whose progressive notions they are known to be in\r\nsympathy. It is unnecessary to say that these gentlemen do not\r\nconsciously take part in the deception which is practised, but it is\r\nnevertheless a fact that whenever the Pretoria clique desire to trail\r\nthe red herring they do it by the employment in seeming good faith of\r\none or other of those gentlemen whose character and sympathies\r\nentitle them to the respect and confidence of the Uitlander.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday Mr. Eugene Marais, the editor of the leading Dutch paper\r\n_Land en Volk_, a gentleman who has worked consistently and\r\nhonourably both for his people, the Transvaal Dutch, and for the\r\ncause of pure and enlightened government, visited Johannesburg, being\r\nconvinced that there was serious trouble in store for the country\r\nunless prompt and decisive steps were taken to remedy the conditions\r\nunder which the Rand community were suffering. No one in the country\r\nhas fought harder against the abuses which exist in Pretoria nor has\r\nanyone risked more, nor yet is there a more loyal champion of the\r\nBoer; and Mr. Marais, having on his own initiative investigated the\r\ncondition of affairs in Johannesburg and reported the result to some\r\nof the leading members of the Government, telegraphed to a member\r\nof the Committee on Tuesday morning beseeching that body to make a\r\nstrenuous effort to avert bloodshed, using the words, 'For God's\r\nsake, let us meet and settle things like men!' and further stating\r\nthat he and Mr. Malan, son-in-law of General Joubert, were bringing\r\nover a message from the Government, and that he hoped the Committee\r\nwould meet them in a reasonable spirit.\r\n\r\nA full meeting of the Committee was at once called to receive the two\r\ndelegates. The meeting took place at 9 p.m. and lasted until 12 p.m.\r\non Tuesday night. Mr. Marais's evidence during the course of the\r\ntrial detailed the events which led up to this meeting. He stated\r\nthat in consequence of what he had observed in Johannesburg on Monday\r\nand Tuesday he returned to Pretoria, convinced that unless something\r\nwas done by Government to relieve the position there would most\r\ninevitably be a civil war. He reported the condition of things to\r\nGeneral Joubert, who deemed it of sufficient importance to have the\r\nmatter brought before the Executive. Messrs. Marais and Malan were\r\nthereupon received by the Executive and authorized to meet the Reform\r\nCommittee on behalf of the Government. With reference to the now\r\nfamous 'olive branch' phrase, Mr. Marais states that the expression\r\nwas first used by a member of the Committee in Johannesburg on\r\nTuesday morning. The condition of things was being discussed and this\r\nmember commented severely upon the action of the Government. Mr.\r\nMarais urged that things were not so bad as to justify a determined\r\nattempt to provoke civil war, and stated that he believed that the\r\nexcitement prevailing would convince the Government that they had now\r\ngone too far and that when they realized the seriousness of the\r\nposition they would be willing to make proper concessions, and he\r\nsaid in conclusion that the people of Johannesburg, if they were as\r\ngood as their professions and desired reform and not revolution,\r\nwould even at the eleventh hour be willing to meet the Government.\r\nThe member of the Reform Committee replied that this was undoubtedly\r\nthe attitude of the Johannesburg people, but that it was\r\nabsolutely useless to keep on patiently waiting for the fulfilment of\r\npromises which were only made to be broken; that if Johannesburg had\r\nany evidence that the Government meant honestly by them they would of\r\ncourse treat and endeavour to avert bloodshed; that the Uitlanders\r\nhad so far always offered the olive branch and sought to establish\r\nharmony. That however was all over, and let the Government now take\r\nthe first steps if they were in earnest.\r\n\r\nMr. Marais reported the whole of this conversation to the Executive\r\nCouncil and, upon his making use of the expression 'olive branch,'\r\nthe President exclaimed excitedly, 'What are they talking about? What\r\nis an olive branch?' When this was explained to him he nodded and\r\nsaid, 'Yes, that is what we will do,' and Mr. Wolmarans another\r\nmember of the Executive exclaimed, 'Go back to the Johannesburg\r\npeople and tell them that we have already offered the olive branch by\r\nvoluntarily withdrawing our police from the town in order to avoid\r\nconflict, thus leaving them in entire possession. It is for them to\r\nsay whether they will accept it.'\r\n\r\nThe meeting at which Messrs. Marais and Malan were commissioned to\r\nnegotiate with the Johannesburg people was, with the exception of\r\nGeneral Smit (then dying and since dead), attended by every member of\r\nthe Executive Council, and there is no truth in the suggestion made\r\non behalf of the Government that it was an informal meeting of a few\r\nmen who were not acting on behalf of the State, nor is there any\r\njustification for the statement made by Judge Ameshof in the\r\nwitness-box that Messrs. Marais and Malan were not officially\r\nauthorized to negotiate with the Reform Committee.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Marais and Malan met the Reform Committee in the general\r\ncommittee-room, and both gentlemen addressed the meeting several\r\ntimes, going fully into the grievances complained of by the\r\nUitlanders and explaining very fully the position of the Government\r\nand their attitude during the meeting of the Executive Council which\r\nthey had been called upon to attend. They stated that they had been\r\nsent by a full meeting of the Executive to ask the Reform Committee\r\nto send a deputation to Pretoria in order to meet a Commission to\r\nbe appointed by Government with a view to effecting a peaceful\r\nsettlement and the redress of grievances; that the Commission would\r\nconsist of Chief Justice Kotzé, Judge Ameshof, and another, probably\r\na member of the Executive Council; that the Government were willing\r\nto consider and redress the grievances, and were, above all things,\r\nanxious to avoid conflict with their own subjects.\r\n\r\nThen came the much-quoted expression: 'We come in fact to offer you\r\nthe olive branch; it is for you to say if you will take it; if you\r\nare sincere in your professions, you will.' A great deal of\r\ndiscussion took place, many members of the Committee maintaining\r\nthat, although they placed full confidence in the gentlemen who had\r\nbeen sent by Government, they were nevertheless convinced that there\r\nwas treachery at the bottom of it, and they stated in plain language\r\nwhat has become more or less an article of faith with the Uitlander:\r\n'Whenever the Government are earnestly intent upon deceiving us they\r\nselect emissaries in whose character and good faith we have complete\r\ntrust, and by deceiving them ensure that we shall be misled.' Both\r\ngentlemen repeatedly assured the meeting that the Government were\r\nmost anxious to remove the causes of discontent, and stated moreover\r\nthat Johannesburg would get practically all that was asked for in the\r\nManifesto. When asked what was meant by 'practically all,' they\r\nexplained that there would be some minor points of course on which\r\nJohannesburg would have to give way in order to meet the Government,\r\nas their position was also a very difficult one, and there were in\r\nparticular two matters on which there would be some difficulty, but\r\nby no means insurmountable. When asked if the two matters were the\r\nremoval of religious disabilities and the franchise, one of the two\r\ngentlemen replied that he had been told that there would be some\r\ndifficulty on these two points, but that they were quite open to\r\ndiscussion as to the details and he was convinced that there would\r\nsurely be a means of coming to an understanding by compromise even on\r\nthese two. Messrs. Marais and Malan also informed the meeting that\r\nthe High Commissioner had issued a proclamation calling upon Dr.\r\nJameson to desist from the invasion and to return to British\r\nterritory at once; that the proclamation had been duly forwarded\r\nto him from several points; and that there was no doubt that he would\r\nturn back. Messrs. Marais and Malan both stated that they were\r\nthemselves proceeding with the commando against Dr. Jameson should he\r\nfail to obey the High Commissioner's mandate, and stated also that\r\nalthough they were making every effort that was humanly possible to\r\navert conflict it must be clearly understood that if from the\r\nunreasonable action of Johannesburg fighting took place between the\r\nGovernment forces and a revolutionary force from Johannesburg, they\r\nas in duty bound would fight for their Government, and that in the\r\nGovernment ranks would be found those men who had been the most\r\narduous workers in the cause of reform. They were assured that there\r\nwas no such feeling as desire for revenge actuating the people who\r\nhad taken up arms, that it was simply a desire for fair treatment and\r\ndecent government, that the present demand was what had been already\r\ndetailed in the Manifesto, and that the Committee stood by that\r\ndocument, but would nevertheless accept as sufficient for the time\r\nbeing any reasonable proportion of the redress demanded.\r\n\r\nIn spite of differences as to the motives of the Government in\r\nholding out the olive branch it was decided unanimously that the\r\nrequest as conveyed by Messrs. Marais and Malan should be complied\r\nwith, and that a deputation should be sent over early on the\r\nfollowing morning to meet the Government Commission. Under the\r\ncircumstances it was quite useless to discuss whether the Government\r\ndesigned these negotiations merely as a ruse in order to gain time,\r\nor whether they were actually dealing with the Committee in good\r\nfaith and intending to effect the redress promised. At that time\r\nJohannesburg itself had not been protected by earthworks, and the\r\nunpacking of the Maxims and rifles had only just been completed.\r\nThroughout Tuesday night and Wednesday earthworks were being thrown\r\nup, and every effort was being directed towards placing the town in a\r\nstate of defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE'S DILEMMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the best will in the world it would have been quite impossible\r\nto render any assistance to Dr. Jameson's forces, but apart from this\r\nthere never was the slightest doubt of his ability to get into\r\nJohannesburg without assistance should he decide to attempt it. In\r\nconversation with the leaders of the movement he had always scouted\r\nthe idea of requiring assistance from Johannesburg, nor would anyone\r\nhave believed that with a well-equipped and perfectly trained force\r\nof 800 men (as it was believed he had) it was possible for the Boers\r\nto get together a force sufficiently strong to stop him in his dash\r\non Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Mr. Charles Leonard, who had been recognized as the\r\nleader of the movement, Mr. Lionel Phillips was elected Chairman of\r\nthe Reform Committee, and he and Messrs. J.G. Auret, A. Bailey, and\r\nM. Langermann were chosen as the Committee's deputation to proceed to\r\nPretoria and meet the Commission appointed by the Government. They\r\nleft at an early hour on Wednesday morning, and were given\r\npractically a free hand to act on behalf of the Reform Committee. The\r\nposition having been so thoroughly discussed there was no possibility\r\nof misunderstanding; there was no division in the Committee as to the\r\nattitude to be taken up. The deputation were to negotiate with the\r\nGovernment for a peaceful settlement on the basis of the Manifesto,\r\naccepting what they might consider to be a reasonable instalment of\r\nthe reforms demanded. They were to deal with the Government in a\r\nconciliatory spirit and to avoid all provocation to civil strife, but\r\nat the same time to insist upon the recognition of rights and the\r\nredress of the grievances, to avow the association with Dr. Jameson's\r\nforces so far as it had existed, and to include him in any settlement\r\nthat might be made. It was impossible to lay down any definite\r\nlines on which to negotiate on behalf of Dr. Jameson, as the Reform\r\nCommittee were still in complete ignorance of his reasons for\r\nstarting; but it was considered fairer and more reasonable to assume\r\nthat he had started in good faith and that the two messengers who had\r\nbeen sent to stop him had not reached him, and to act accordingly.\r\nHowever awkward a predicament he had placed the Johannesburg people\r\nin, they accepted a certain moral responsibility for him and his\r\nactions and decided to make his safety the first consideration.\r\n\r\nLate on Tuesday night the Collector of Customs at Johannesburg\r\ninformed members of the Reform Committee that he had received a\r\ntelegraphic despatch from the Pretoria head office notifying the\r\nsuspension of all duties on various articles of food. It will be\r\nremembered that this relief was prayed for by the representative\r\nbodies of mining and commerce on the Rand several weeks before the\r\noutbreak and that the Government had replied that they were unable\r\nduring the recess to deal with the matter as the legislative power\r\nand the power of levying and remitting duties had been taken from the\r\nExecutive by the Volksraad some time previously. It will also be\r\nremembered that the Government acted on this hint as to the\r\nnecessities of the community in a wholly unexpected way by granting a\r\nmonopoly for the free importation of grain to a favoured individual\r\nof their party in Pretoria. It is not wonderful therefore that the\r\nnotification conveyed by the Collector of Customs was received with\r\nconsiderable derision, and the opinion was expressed that it would\r\nhave redounded more to the credit of the Government's honesty and\r\nintelligence had they remitted the duties when first petitioned\r\ninstead of doing so at the last moment hastily and ungracefully--so\r\nto speak, at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, whilst the deputation were engaged in\r\nnegotiations with the Government Commission, a telegram was received\r\nby the Reform Committee in Johannesburg from Sir Jacobus de Wet,\r\nthe British agent, conveying the following proclamation of the High\r\nCommissioner:\r\n\r\nWhereas it has come to my knowledge that certain British subjects,\r\nsaid to be under the leadership of Dr. Jameson, have violated\r\nthe territory of the South African Republic, and have cut\r\ntelegraph-wires, and done various other illegal acts; and whereas the\r\nSouth African Republic is a friendly State, in amity with Her\r\nMajesty's Government; and whereas it is my desire to respect the\r\nindependence of the said State;\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I hereby command the said Dr. Jameson and all persons\r\naccompanying him to immediately retire from the territory of the\r\nSouth African Republic, on pain of the penalties attached to their\r\nillegal proceedings; and I do further hereby call upon all British\r\nsubjects in the South African Republic to abstain from giving the\r\nsaid Dr. Jameson any countenance or assistance in his armed violation\r\nof the territory of a friendly State.\r\n\r\nA reply was immediately sent to the British Agent stating that the\r\nReform Committee were not aware of the reasons which prompted Dr.\r\nJameson to start, but that as he was coming to their assistance,\r\npresumably in good faith, they felt morally bound to provide for him,\r\nand they therefore urged the British Agent most strongly to spare no\r\neffort in forwarding the proclamation to Dr. Jameson so that he might\r\nbe aware of the action taken by the Imperial Government and might\r\nturn back before any conflict should take place between his and the\r\nBoer forces. The Committee offered to forward the despatch themselves\r\nif facilities of passport were given.\r\n\r\nA full meeting of the Committee was immediately convened in order to\r\nconsider this new complication of the case, and the following\r\ntelegram was approved and sent at 11.15 a.m., addressed to the\r\nDeputation of the Reform Committee, care of Her Majesty's Agent,\r\nPretoria:\r\n\r\nMeeting has been held since you started to consider telegram from\r\nBritish Agent, and it was unanimously resolved to authorize you to\r\nmake following offer to Government. Begins: 'In order to avert\r\nbloodshed on grounds of Dr. Jameson's action, if Government will\r\nallow Dr. Jameson to come in unmolested, the Committee will guarantee\r\nwith their persons if necessary that he shall leave again peacefully\r\nwithin as little delay as possible.'{22}\r\n\r\nThe Committee well realized the fatal results of Dr. Jameson's\r\ninvasion under the circumstances, and much as their position had been\r\ninjured and complicated by his action, it was felt that it would\r\nstill be better to get rid of the foreign element which he\r\nrepresented and to fight the battle out under such conditions as\r\nmight arise without any assistance than to let things go from bad to\r\nworse through further action on Dr. Jameson's part.\r\n\r\nNo reply had been received from the High Commissioner to the\r\ntelegrams urging him to come up in person. Mr. Cecil Rhodes had\r\ntelegraphed that he was urgently pressing the High Commissioner to\r\ncome, but that he had received no assurances as yet from him. During\r\nWednesday Messrs. Leonard and Hamilton telegraphed that the former\r\nhad seen the High Commissioner, who had declined to move unless\r\ninvited by the other side; they were using every effort to induce him\r\nto move but no reliance could be placed upon him. They further\r\nadvised that in their strong opinion a reasonable compromise should\r\nbe effected, and that it was most vital to avoid offence. Mr. F.H.\r\nHamilton, who was one of the first associated with the movement,\r\nfinding then that nothing more could be done and feeling that his\r\nproper place was with his comrades, refused to remain longer and\r\nreturned to Johannesburg, arriving there after Dr. Jameson's\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half days had now elapsed since Dr. Jameson started, and\r\nthe Committee were still without word or sign from him as to his\r\nhaving started or the reason which prompted him to do so. None knew\r\nbetter than Dr. Jameson himself the difficulties and magnitude of the\r\ntask which he had set the Reform Committee when he struck his camp at\r\nPitsani and marched into the Transvaal. None knew better than he that\r\nwith the best luck and all the will and energy in the world it would\r\nhardly be possible to do as much as place the town in a position of\r\ndefence. Every hour some explanation or some message was expected\r\nfrom him, something to throw a little light on his action; but\r\nnothing ever came, and the Committee were left to act in the dark as\r\ntheir judgment or good fortune might lead them.\r\n\r\nThe deputation which had been sent to Pretoria met the Government\r\nCommission at noon on Wednesday. The Commission consisted of Chief\r\nJustice Kotzé (Chairman), Judge Ameshof, and Executive Member Kock.\r\nThere was a Government shorthand clerk present. Before the business\r\nof the meeting was gone into, at the request of the Chief Justice\r\nthe deputation consented to minutes of the interview being taken,\r\nremarking that as they were dealing with the Government in good faith\r\nthey had nothing to conceal. It may be well to mention that at the\r\nmeeting of Messrs. Malan and Marais with the Reform Committee the\r\nquestion was raised as to the attitude of the Government towards the\r\ndeputation which it was suggested should be sent to Pretoria. Someone\r\nremarked that the Government were quite capable of inducing the\r\ndeputation to go to Pretoria, having them arrested as soon as they\r\ngot there, and holding them as hostages. Messrs. Marais and Malan\r\nboth scouted the idea and stated positively that the Executive\r\nCouncil had formally acknowledged to them that they were negotiating\r\nwith the Reform Committee in good faith, and that negotiations would\r\nof course be carried on in a decent manner as between two civilized\r\nparties in arms. These little incidents have a peculiar interest now\r\nin view of the treachery practised by the Government by means of the\r\nnegotiations with the deputation.\r\n\r\nMr. Lionel Phillips as spokesman detailed at length the position of\r\naffairs in Johannesburg, citing the grievances and disabilities under\r\nwhich the Uitlander population existed. He pointed out that year\r\nafter year the Uitlanders had been begging and petitioning for\r\nredress of these grievances, for some amelioration of their\r\ncondition, for fair and uniform treatment of all the white subjects\r\nof the State, and for some representation in the Legislature of the\r\ncountry, as they were entitled by their numbers and their work and\r\ntheir property to have; yet not only had a deaf ear been turned to\r\nall their petitions, but the conditions were actually aggravated year\r\nby year and, instead of obtaining relief, there was a marked increase\r\nin the burdens and disabilities imposed. He informed the Commission\r\nthat the Manifesto fairly represented the views of the Reform\r\nCommittee and the people of Johannesburg; that, whilst they were\r\ndetermined to have their rights, they recognised that it might not\r\nbe possible to obtain complete redress at once, and they were\r\nprepared to accept what they might consider a reasonable instalment\r\nof redress. He stated that Dr. Jameson had remained on the borders\r\nof the Transvaal with an armed force by a written arrangement with\r\ncertain of the leaders, and that he was there to render active\r\nassistance should the community be driven to extremes and require his\r\nassistance; but as to his present action the Committee could throw no\r\nfurther light upon it, as they were in ignorance of his reason for\r\nstarting; they could only assume that he had done so in good faith,\r\nprobably misled by rumours of trouble in Johannesburg which he\r\nthought he had sufficient reason to believe. He added that so far\r\nfrom being invited by the Committee, messengers had actually been\r\nsent to prevent him from moving, but that it was not known to the\r\nCommittee if these messengers had reached him or if the telegrams\r\nwhich had been sent with a like purpose had ever been delivered to\r\nhim, and that consequently the Committee preferred to believe that he\r\nhad come in in good faith and thinking the community to be in dire\r\nneed, and for this reason the people of Johannesburg were resolved to\r\nstand by him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussion, Executive Member Kock remarked: 'If\r\nyou have erected fortifications and have taken up arms, you are\r\nnothing but rebels.' Mr. Phillips replied: 'You can call us rebels if\r\nyou like. All we want is justice, decent treatment, and honest\r\ngovernment; that is what we have come to ask of you.' Mr. Kock\r\nthereupon remarked that the deputation spoke as though they\r\nrepresented Johannesburg, whereas for all the Government knew the\r\nReform Committee might be but a few individuals of no influence; and\r\nhe asked if they could be informed as to who constituted that body.\r\nThe deputation gave certain names from memory and offered to\r\ntelegraph for a full list. The reply came in time to be handed to the\r\nGovernment and it constituted the sole piece of evidence ever\r\nobtained as to who were members of the Reform Committee. After\r\nhearing the statement of Mr. Phillips the Chief Justice informed the\r\ndeputation that the Commission were not empowered to arrange\r\nterms, but were merely authorized to hear what the deputation had to\r\nsay, to ascertain their grievances and the proposed remedies, and to\r\nreport this discussion to the Government. Taking up certain points\r\nreferred to by Mr. Phillips, the Chief Justice asked whether the\r\nJohannesburg people would consent to lay down their arms if the\r\nGovernment granted practically all the reforms that were asked.\r\nMr. Phillips replied in the affirmative, adding that after\r\nenfranchisement the community would naturally be privileged to take\r\nup arms again as burghers of the State. The Chief Justice asked on\r\nwhat lines it was proposed that the franchise should be granted. The\r\ndeputation replied that the community would be quite content if the\r\nGovernment would accept the principle, leaving the settlement of\r\ndetails to a Commission of three persons--one to be appointed by\r\neach party, and the third to be mutually agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was adjourned at noon until 5 p.m., and in the meantime\r\nthe deputation telegraphed to the Reform Committee in Johannesburg\r\nthe substance of what had taken place, stating among other things\r\nthat they had explained the arrangements with Dr. Jameson. That such\r\na message should be sent through the Government telegraph-office at a\r\ntime when every telegram was read for the purpose of obtaining\r\ninformation as to what was on foot is further proof (if proof be\r\nneeded) that the 'revelations' as to the connection between Dr.\r\nJameson and the Reformers, which were brought out with theatrical\r\neffect later on, were not by any means a startling surprise to the\r\nGovernment, and were in fact well known to them in all essential\r\ndetails before the first encounter between the Boers and Dr. Jameson\r\nhad taken place. The significance of this fact in its bearing upon\r\nDr. Jameson's surrender and the after-treatment of the Reform\r\nprisoners should not be lost sight of.\r\n\r\nThe adjourned meeting between the Government Commission and the\r\nReform Committee deputation took place at 5 p.m., when the Chief\r\nJustice intimated to the deputation that they had reported to a full\r\nmeeting of the Executive Council all that had taken place at the\r\nmorning meeting, and that the Executive had authorized them to hand\r\nto the deputation in answer a resolution, the substance of which\r\nis given hereunder:\r\n\r\nThe High Commissioner has offered his services with a view to a\r\npeaceful settlement. The Government of the South African Republic\r\nhave accepted his offer. Pending his arrival, no hostile step will be\r\ntaken against Johannesburg provided Johannesburg takes no hostile\r\nstep against the Government. In terms of a certain proclamation\r\nrecently issued by the State President the grievances will be\r\nearnestly considered.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give the exact wording of the minute because the\r\noriginal document was inadvertently destroyed and all applications to\r\nGovernment for a copy were met at first by evasions and finally by\r\npoint-blank refusal. The document was required as evidence in the\r\ntrial of the Reform prisoners and every effort was made to secure an\r\nexact copy. As a last resource the above version, as sworn to by a\r\nnumber of men who had seen the original document, was put in. The\r\nGovernment were informed that if a true copy of the original\r\nresolution as recorded in the Minute Book of the Executive Council\r\nwere not supplied for the purposes of evidence in the trial the\r\nprisoners would hand in the version given above. No reply was\r\nreceived to this, and the State Attorney acting on behalf of the\r\nGovernment admitted the version here given in the statement put in by\r\nthe prisoners. It is clear therefore that if this version errs in any\r\nrespect it cannot at all events be to the disadvantage of the\r\nGovernment or they would assuredly have objected to it and have\r\nproduced the resolution itself.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the above resolution the deputation inquired whether\r\nthis offer of the Government's was intended to include Dr. Jameson.\r\nThe Chief Justice replied that the Government declined to treat about\r\nhim as he was a foreign invader and would have to be turned out of\r\nthe country. The deputation thereupon handed in the telegram from the\r\nReform Committee, already quoted, offering their persons as security,\r\nand pointed out that this was the most earnest and substantial\r\nguarantee that it was possible to offer that the Committee had not\r\ninvited Dr. Jameson and had no desire to destroy the independence of\r\nthe State. The Commission in reply stated that the proclamation of\r\nthe High Commissioner was being forwarded to Dr. Jameson from\r\nvarious quarters, and that he would inevitably be stopped. In reply\r\nto the statement by the deputation that they were not empowered to\r\naccept terms which did not explicitly include Dr. Jameson but would\r\nreport to headquarters and reply later on, the Chief Justice stated\r\nthat the Government required no answer to the resolution handed to\r\nthem. This was in fact _their_ answer, and if the people of\r\nJohannesburg observed the conditions mentioned therein there would\r\nbe no further trouble, but if they disregarded them they would be\r\nheld responsible for whatever followed. The deputation returned to\r\nJohannesburg fully convinced that the grievances would be redressed\r\nand a peaceful settlement arrived at through the mediation of the\r\nHigh Commissioner, and that Dr. Jameson would inevitably obey\r\nthe latter's proclamation and leave the country peacefully on\r\nascertaining that there was no necessity for his intervention on\r\nbehalf of the Uitlanders.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Government supply the deputation with the minute in\r\nwriting already quoted, but they also instructed the local officers\r\nof Johannesburg to make public their decision to avail themselves of\r\nSir Hercules Robinson's services. It will be observed that the\r\nnotification published in Johannesburg is not so full as the\r\nExecutive minute handed to the deputation in Pretoria, but the spirit\r\nin which it was given and accepted is shown by the following notice\r\nissued by the Reform Committee embodying the official statement:\r\n\r\nREFORM COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nNOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe Government have handed us a written reply this afternoon (January\r\n1), stating they have agreed to accept the offer of the High\r\nCommissioner to go to Pretoria to assist the Government in preventing\r\nbloodshed, and then the representations of the Committee will be\r\ntaken into serious consideration. The communication referred to is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n'The Government of the South African Republic have accepted the offer\r\nof the High Commissioner to come to Pretoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (Signed)    J. L. VAN DER MERWE, _Mining Commissioner._\r\n              J. F. DE BEER, _Judicial Commissioner._\r\n              CARL JEPPE, _Member of the First Volksraad,_\r\n                              _Johannesburg._\r\n              A. H. BLECKSLEY, _Commandant Volunteers._\r\n\r\nDesirous as the Committee has always been to obtain its objects\r\nwithout the shedding of blood and incurring the horrors of civil war,\r\nthe opportunity of achieving its aims by peaceful means is welcome.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Committee desires that the public will aid them with the\r\nloyalty and enthusiasm which they have shown so far in the\r\nmaintenance of its organization, and will stand firm in the cause of\r\nlaw and order and the establishment of their rights.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Committee.\r\n\r\nThis notice was published in the local press, and also distributed as\r\na leaflet in Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nMore than this! At one o'clock on Wednesday President Kruger had sent\r\nfor Sir Jacobus de Wet and requested him to transmit to the Reform\r\nCommittee the following message: 'I desire again to invite your\r\nserious attention to the fact that negotiations are going on between\r\nMr. Chamberlain and His Honour the President. I am convinced the\r\nGovernment is prepared to meet any committee or deputation at any\r\ntime to discuss matters. In view of this and of negotiations with Mr.\r\nChamberlain I advise you to follow a constitutional course.' That\r\ntelegram was framed at President Kruger's request and approved by him\r\nbefore being transmitted.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said about the impolicy, and even the bad\r\nfaith, of the Johannesburg people in concluding an armistice which\r\ndid not include Dr. Jameson. From the above account it is clear in\r\nthe first place that every effort was made to provide for his safety,\r\nand in the next place that no armistice was concluded. Certain terms\r\nwere offered by the Government which it was open to the Committee to\r\neither accept or reject or ignore, as they might decide later on. In\r\nplain English, the Committee were as free after the negotiations as\r\nthey had been before. They gave no undertaking to abstain from\r\nhostile action; they simply received the offer of the Government.\r\nWhether they complied with those conditions as a matter of\r\ncold-blooded selfish policy, whether they simply selected an easy way\r\nout of a difficult position, or whether they complied with the\r\nconditions solely because they were not in a position to do anything\r\nelse, it is open to every man to decide for himself; but it does not\r\nseem fair, in face of the fact that they were _not_ able to do\r\nanything else, to impute the worst motives of all for the course\r\nwhich they eventually took.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the deputation to Johannesburg a report of what had\r\ntaken place was given to a full meeting of the Reform Committee.\r\nDivers opinions were expressed as to what was the right course to\r\ntake, but eventually all were agreed that, as the first duty of the\r\nCommittee was undoubtedly to protect the town and the unarmed section\r\nof the community, as they could not afford to send a single man out\r\nof the place, as there was no reason to suppose that Dr. Jameson\r\nrequired or would welcome any assistance, and as it seemed certain\r\nthat he would be stopped by the High Commissioner's proclamation and\r\nturned back, it would be nothing short of criminal madness to adopt\r\nany aggressive measures at that stage.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear to have occurred to many of the hostile critics of\r\nthe Reform Committee to consider what might have happened when they\r\nare judging what actually took place. Dr. Jameson had invaded the\r\ncountry with less than 500 men. It must be clear from this that it\r\nwas not his intention to conquer the Transvaal. It must have been and\r\nindeed it was his idea that it would be impossible for the Imperial\r\nGovernment to stand passively by and witness the struggle between its\r\nown subjects preferring legitimate and moderate claims and a corrupt\r\nand incompetent Boer Government. Intervention of one sort or another\r\nhe certainly expected--either material help in the shape of British\r\ntroops, or the intervention of the High Commissioner to effect a\r\npeaceful settlement. By the false step which evoked the High\r\nCommissioner's proclamation he had forfeited all claim to the support\r\non which he reckoned. It was reasonable to suppose therefore that, on\r\nthe receipt of the proclamation ordering him to return and calling on\r\nall British subjects to abstain from assisting him, he would realize\r\nthe consequences of his mistake. He would also learn from the Reform\r\nCommittee's messengers (that is, assuming that he did not know it\r\nalready) that the Johannesburg people neither required nor wished for\r\nhis intervention, and he would elect to leave the country in\r\naccordance with the High Commissioner's mandate rather than continue\r\na course which, with the opposition of the British Government added\r\nto that of the Boer Government, must inevitably end in disgrace and\r\ndisaster. This was the conclusion arrived at in the Reform\r\nCommittee room; and it was then considered what would be the position\r\nof the Johannesburg people if, in defiance of the High Commissioner's\r\nproclamation and in violation of the terms offered by the Transvaal\r\nGovernment, they should adopt aggressive and wholly futile measures\r\nin aid of Dr. Jameson, only to find that he himself had obeyed the\r\nproclamation and had turned back.\r\n\r\nNo man in his senses would have anticipated Dr. Jameson's continuing\r\nhis march after receipt of the proclamation and full information as\r\nto the wishes and position of the Johannesburg people. But, apart\r\nfrom this, it was the opinion of military men, such as Colonel\r\nHeyman, who had been sent in by Dr. Jameson, and who were present at\r\nthe meetings of the Reform Committee, that it would not be possible\r\nfor the Boers to stop him, and that it would require a very large\r\nforce indeed to cope with a body of men so well trained, well\r\nequipped, and well led as his were thought to be. It would moreover\r\nneed extraordinary luck and management on the Boers' side to get\r\ntogether any considerable force in time to intercept him before he\r\nshould reach Johannesburg. It may be added that the opinion expressed\r\nby these gentlemen is still adhered to. They say that, properly led,\r\nJameson's force should have got in without firing a shot, and that,\r\nproperly handled, they should not have been stopped by a much greater\r\nnumber of Boers. However this is as it may be.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, and the statement has gained considerable\r\ncredence, that the very train which brought the deputation back to\r\nJohannesburg after their negotiations with the Government also\r\nbrought a detachment of the State artillery with field-pieces and\r\na plentiful supply of ammunition to reinforce the Boers, who were\r\nthen in position to intercept Dr. Jameson, and it has further been\r\nsuggested that the obvious course for the Reform Committee to have\r\ntaken was to break up the line and to stop trains passing out towards\r\nKrugersdorp, also to seize the telegraph and railway offices. Such\r\naction would have been perfectly futile. As a matter of fact the\r\nartillery and ammunition were sent direct from Pretoria by waggon,\r\nand not through Johannesburg at all.{23} Any such action as the\r\nseizing of the telegraph and railway offices would have been useless\r\nin itself, if intended to aid Jameson's force, and would of course\r\nhave been a declaration of war on the part of the Committee against\r\nthe Transvaal Government, a declaration which they were not able to\r\nback up by any effective measures. A partially successful attempt\r\nwas made to blow up the line between Johannesburg and Krugersdorp by\r\nindividuals who thought that they would be rendering a service to the\r\ncause, and who did not stop to calculate the full effects of their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of Wednesday, while the deputation were still\r\nengaged in negotiation with the Government Commission, the messenger\r\ndespatched by Sir Jacobus de Wet, British Agent in Pretoria, to\r\ndeliver the High Commissioner's proclamation to Dr. Jameson, arrived\r\nin Johannesburg, and applied at the Reform Committee rooms for an\r\nescort through the lines of defence, showing at the same time the\r\npassport given him by the Commandant-General to pass him through the\r\nBoer lines. It was immediately decided to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity in order to bring further pressure to bear upon Dr.\r\nJameson to induce him to leave the country peacefully, and to make\r\nfinally and absolutely sure that he should realize the true position\r\nof affairs. Mr. J. J. Lace, a member of the Reform Committee,\r\nvolunteered to accompany the messenger to explain to Dr. Jameson the\r\nstate of affairs in Johannesburg and to induce him to return while\r\nthere was yet a chance of retrieving the position. On the return of\r\nthe deputation this action of the rest of the Committee was cordially\r\napproved and was found to be in entire accord with the attitude taken\r\nup by them in their dealings with the Government.\r\n\r\nIf any evidence were needed as to the sincerity and singleness of\r\npurpose of the Committee, the action taken by the deputation in\r\nPretoria and the rest of the Committee in Johannesburg, whilst\r\nacting independently of each other and without any opportunity of\r\ndiscussing matters and deciding upon a common line, should be\r\nsufficient. If the Committee as a whole had not been following an\r\nhonest and clearly-defined policy they would have inevitably come to\r\ngrief under such trying circumstances. As a matter of fact, the steps\r\ntaken during Wednesday by the two sections acting independently were\r\nwholly in accord.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day it became known that Dr. Jameson had caused\r\nto be published the letter of invitation quoted in another chapter,\r\nand from this it was clear to those who knew the circumstances under\r\nwhich the letter was given that he had deliberately started in\r\nviolation of the agreement entered into, that he had thrown\r\ndiscretion to the winds, and decided to force the hands of the\r\nJohannesburg people. The result of this was that among the leaders it\r\nwas realized that Dr. Jameson was playing his own hand with complete\r\nindifference to the consequences for others; but the vast majority of\r\nthe Rand community could not possibly realize this, and were firmly\r\nconvinced that the invading force had come in in good faith,\r\nbelieving the community to be in extreme peril.\r\n\r\nIn sensational matters of this kind it is very often the case that a\r\nsingle phrase will illustrate the position more aptly than chapters\r\nof description. It is unfortunately also the case that phrases are\r\nused and catch the ear and survive the circumstances of the time,\r\ncarrying with them meanings which they were never intended to convey.\r\nIn the course of the events which took place in the early part of the\r\nyear many such expressions were seized on and continually quoted.\r\nAmong them, and belonging to the second description above referred\r\nto, is the phrase 'Stand by Jameson.' It was never used in the sense\r\nof sending out an armed force to the assistance of Dr. Jameson,\r\nbecause it was recognized from the beginning that such a course was\r\nnot within the range of possibility. The phrase was first used in\r\nthe Executive Council Chamber when the deputation from the Reform\r\nCommittee met the Government Commission and Mr. Lionel Phillips\r\nexplained the nature of the connection between the Johannesburg\r\npeople and the invading force. After showing that the Rand community\r\nwere not responsible for his immediate action, and after\r\nacknowledging that he was on the border with the intention of\r\nrendering assistance if it should be necessary, he said that the\r\nUitlanders nevertheless believed that, owing to circumstances of\r\nwhich they were ignorant, Dr. Jameson had started in absolute good\r\nfaith to come to their assistance, and for that reason they were\r\ndetermined to stand by him. For that reason they offered their\r\npersons as security for his peaceful evacuation of the country--a\r\ncourse which was then, and is still, deemed to be 'standing by him'\r\nin as effective and practical a manner as it was possible for men in\r\ntheir position to do.\r\n\r\nThe reproach levelled at the Reform Committee by members of the\r\nTransvaal Government ever since the surrender of Dr. Jameson is\r\nthat, whilst professing not to support hostile action against the\r\nState, and whilst avowing loyalty to the Republic, the people of\r\nJohannesburg did not give the logical and practical proof of such\r\nloyalty that the Government were entitled to expect; that is, they\r\ndid not take up arms to fight against the invaders. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to say that such a preposterous idea never entered the\r\nminds of any of the Uitlanders. When all is said and done, blood is\r\nthicker than water, alike with the Uitlanders as with the Boers. The\r\nBoers have shown on many occasions that they elect to side with their\r\nkin on the promptings of their heart rather than support those whom\r\ntheir judgment shows them to be worthy of their assistance. Had the\r\nUitlanders been sufficiently armed there can be no question that\r\nrightly or wrongly they would have sided with Jameson, and would have\r\ngiven him effective support had they known that he needed it. Had he\r\never reached Johannesburg the enthusiasm would have been wild and\r\nunbounded, and, however much the cooler heads among the community\r\nmight realize that such a partial success might have proved a\r\nmore serious misfortune than the total failure has been, no such\r\nconsiderations would have weighed with the community in general; and\r\nthe men who were aiming at practical and lasting good results, rather\r\nthan cultivating popular enthusiasm, would have been swept aside, and\r\nothers, more in accord with the humour of the moment, would have\r\ntaken their places.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to speculate as to what would have happened had Dr.\r\nJameson reached Johannesburg. The prestige of success might have\r\nenabled him, as it has enabled many others, to achieve the apparently\r\nimpossible and compel the acceptance of terms which would have\r\ninsured a lasting peace; but as Johannesburg had neither arms\r\nnor ammunition, especially the latter, commensurate with the\r\nrequirements of anything like severe fighting, even for a single day,\r\nand as the invading force had not more than enough for its own\r\nrequirements, it is difficult to conceive that anything but disaster\r\ncould have followed.\r\n\r\nThroughout the troubles which followed the invasion it was not the\r\npersonal suffering or loss which fell to the lot of the Johannesburg\r\npeople that touched them so nearly as the taunts which were unjustly\r\nlevelled at them for not rendering assistance to Dr. Jameson. The\r\nterms, 'cowards,' 'poltroons,' and 'traitors,' and the name of\r\n'Judasburg,' absolutely undeserved as they were known to be, rankled\r\nin the hearts of all, and it was only by the exercise of much\r\nself-denial and restraint that it was possible for men to remain\r\nsilent during the period preceding Dr. Jameson's trial. Extremely\r\nbitter feeling was roused by the tacit approval given to these\r\ncensures by the officers of the invading force, for their continued\r\nsilence was naturally construed to be tacit approval. 'Not once,'\r\nsaid one of the Reformers, 'has a single member of Dr. Jameson's\r\nparty come forward and stated that the imputations on the Reformers\r\nwere undeserved; yet we gave them the benefit of every doubt, and\r\ntried throughout to screen them, whilst all the time the Doctor and\r\nat least three of his companions knew that they had started to \"make\r\ntheir own flotation.\" That is not cricket.'\r\n\r\nIt has been urged on behalf of Dr. Jameson that he could not have\r\nbeen asked to state prior to his trial that he never expected or\r\narranged for help from Johannesburg--that his case was already a\r\nsufficiently difficult one without embarrassing it with other\r\npeople's affairs. Yet it was noted in Johannesburg that, when a\r\nreport was circulated to the effect that he had started the invasion\r\non the instructions of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, he and another officer of\r\nhis force wrote jointly to the English papers to say that there was\r\nno truth whatever in the statement. The consequences of taking upon\r\nhimself the responsibility for initiative in this way, while he\r\nhad yet to undergo his trial, were far more serious than would have\r\nfollowed a simple statement to the effect that injustice was being\r\ndone to the Rand community in the charges of cowardice laid against\r\nit. It was felt then, and the feeling has not in any way abated,\r\nthat Dr. Jameson regarded the fate and interests of the people of\r\nJohannesburg with indifference, looking upon them merely as pawns\r\nin a game that he was playing. It was only Mr. Rhodes who took an\r\nopportunity to say that 'the Johannesburg people are not cowards;\r\nthey were rushed.'\r\n\r\nThe general public did not know the circumstances under which Dr.\r\nJameson had agreed to remain on the frontier. They did not know that\r\ntelegrams and messengers had been despatched to stop him, nor was it\r\nfelt advisable to inform them of these steps at a time when matters\r\nhad seemingly gone too far to be stopped. It was considered that any\r\nstatement of that kind put forth at that particular juncture would\r\nsimply tend to create a panic from which no good results could\r\naccrue, and that, as Dr Jameson had cast the die and crossed his\r\nRubicon, as little as possible should be done needlessly to embarrass\r\nhim. Suggestions were continually being made, and have been and are\r\nstill being frequently quoted, to the effect that a force should be\r\nsent out to create a diversion among the Boer commandoes in Jameson's\r\nfavour. Suggestions were made by men who had not the remotest idea of\r\nthe resources at the command of the Committee, or who did not stop to\r\nthink of what might have happened had Johannesburg been depleted of\r\nits armed force, and so left at the mercy of a few hundred Boers.\r\nThere were always, as there will always be, men prepared for any\r\nreckless gamble, but this course was most earnestly considered time\r\nafter time by the Committee when some fresh suggestion or development\r\nseemed to warrant a reconsideration of the decision already arrived\r\nat not to attempt any aggressive measures. Finally the matter was by\r\ncommon consent left in the hands of Colonel Heyman, an officer who\r\nhas rendered distinguished service in South Africa, and whose\r\nreputation and judgment were acknowledged by all. This course was the\r\nmore readily agreed to since Colonel Heyman was by none more\r\nhighly thought of than by Dr. Jameson himself. The decision given by\r\nhim was that the invading force, properly led, drilled and equipped\r\nas it was, was a far stronger body than the entire force enrolled\r\nunder the Reform Committee, and that it would require a very large\r\nforce indeed of burghers to stop it. If Dr. Jameson had thought that\r\nhe would need help there had been ample time for him to send a fast\r\nmounted messenger to Johannesburg. He had not done so; and it was\r\ntherefore to be presumed that as he had taken upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of invasion he was prepared for all contingencies;\r\nbut, apart from this, the force available in Johannesburg, which\r\nwould be in a few days a very good one behind earthworks, was at that\r\nmoment utterly unfit to march out in the open. It would in its then\r\ncondition, and with no equipment of field-pieces, be liable to be\r\nannihilated by a relatively small number of Boers before it should\r\nreach Dr. Jameson. It was decided, however, that, should fighting\r\ntake place within such distance from the town that men could be taken\r\nfrom the defences without endangering the safety of the town, a force\r\nshould be taken out at once.\r\n\r\nFault has repeatedly been found with the military organization in\r\nJohannesburg for not having been well served by an Intelligence\r\nDepartment, and for not knowing from day to day what the whereabouts\r\nand position of Dr. Jameson's forces were.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this is that the Johannesburg people had only two days\r\nin which to look after themselves and protect themselves in the\r\ncrisis in which Dr. Jameson's action had plunged them; that as a\r\nmatter of fact strenuous efforts were made to establish communication\r\nwith the invading force; that the Intelligence Department--which,\r\nconsidering how short a time was available for its organization, was\r\nby no means unsatisfactory--was employed in many directions besides\r\nthat in which Dr. Jameson was moving; that some success was achieved\r\nin communicating with him, but that the risks to be taken, owing to\r\nthe imperative necessity of saving time at almost any cost, were\r\ngreater than usual and resulted in the capture of eight or ten of the\r\nmen employed in the endeavour to communicate with Dr. Jameson alone;\r\nand finally, that since he had seen fit to violate all the\r\narrangements entered into and dash into the country in defiance of\r\nthe expressed wishes of the people, whom he was bent on rescuing\r\nwhether they wished to be rescued or not, the least that could be\r\nexpected of him and of his force was that they should acquaint\r\nthemselves with the road which they proposed to travel and take the\r\nnecessary steps to keep the Johannesburg people posted as to their\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by a prominent member of the invading force--not\r\nDr. Jameson--that since the force had been kept on the border for\r\nsome weeks with the sole object of assisting Johannesburg people when\r\nthey should require assistance, the very least that they were\r\nentitled to expect was that someone should be sent out to show them\r\nthe road and not leave them to go astray for want of a guide. To this\r\nit was replied that a force which had been, as they stated, on the\r\nborder for several weeks with the sole object of invading the country\r\nby a certain road, had ample time, and might certainly have been\r\nexpected to know the road; and as for relieving Johannesburg in its\r\nnecessity, the argument might have applied had this 'necessity' ever\r\narisen; but since the idea was to force the hands of the Reformers,\r\nthe latter might fairly regard themselves as absolved from every\r\nundertaking, specific or implied, which might ever have been made in\r\nconnection with the business. But at that time the excuse had not\r\nbeen devised that there had ever been an undertaking to assist\r\nJameson, on the contrary it was readily admitted that such an idea\r\nwas never entertained for a moment; nor can one understand how anyone\r\ncognizant of the telegram from Dr. Jameson to Dr. Rutherfoord\r\nHarris--'We will make our own flotation by the aid of the letter\r\nwhich I shall publish'--can set up any defence at the expense of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nBy Wednesday night it was known that Major Heany had passed through\r\nMafeking in time to join Dr. Jameson's force, and that, bar some\r\nextraordinary accident, Captain Holden must have met Dr. Jameson on\r\nhis way, since he had been despatched along the road which Dr.\r\nJameson would take in marching on Johannesburg; and if all other\r\nreasons did not suffice to assure the Committee that Dr. Jameson\r\nwould not be relying on any assistance from Johannesburg the\r\npresence of one or other of the two officers above mentioned would\r\nenable him to know that he should not count upon Johannesburg to give\r\nhim active support. Both were thoroughly well acquainted with the\r\nposition and were able to inform him, and have since admitted that\r\nthey did inform him, that he should not count upon a single man\r\ngoing out to meet him. Captain Holden--who prior to the trial of\r\nDr. Jameson and his comrades, prompted by loyalty to his chief,\r\nabstained from making any statement which could possibly embarrass\r\nhim--immediately after the trial expressed his regret at the unjust\r\ncensure upon the Johannesburg people and the charges of cowardice and\r\nbad faith which had been levelled against them, and stated that he\r\nreached Pitsani the night before Dr. Jameson started, and that he\r\nfaithfully and fully delivered the messages which he was charged to\r\ndeliver and earnestly impressed upon Dr. Jameson the position in\r\nwhich the Johannesburg people were placed, and their desire that he\r\nshould not embarrass them by any precipitate action.\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak on Thursday, January 2, Bugler Vallé, of Dr.\r\nJameson's force, arrived in the Reform Committee room and reported\r\nhimself as having been sent by the Doctor at about midnight after the\r\nbattle at Krugersdorp on Wednesday. He stated that the Doctor had\r\nsupplied him with the best horse in the troop and sent him on to\r\ninform Colonel Rhodes where he was. He described the battle at the\r\nQueen's Mine, Krugersdorp, and stated that the force had been obliged\r\nto retreat from the position in which they had fought in order to\r\ntake up a better one on higher ground, but that the position in which\r\nthey had camped for the night was not a very good one. When\r\nquestioned as to the exact message that he had been told to deliver\r\nhe replied, 'The Doctor says, \"Tell them that I am getting along all\r\nright, but they must send out to meet me.\"' He was asked what was\r\nmeant by 'sending out to meet him.' Did it mean to send a force out?\r\nDid he want help? His reply was, 'No; the Doctor says he is getting\r\nalong all right, but you must send out to meet him.' The messenger\r\nwas keenly questioned upon this point, but adhered to the statement\r\nthat the force was getting along all right and would be in early in\r\nthe morning. Colonel Rhodes, who was the first to see the\r\nmessenger, was however dissatisfied with the grudging admissions and\r\nthe ambiguous message, and expressed the belief that 'the Doctor\r\nwants help, but is ashamed to say so.' Acting promptly on this\r\nconviction, he despatched all the mounted men available (about 100)\r\nunder command of Colonel Bettington, with instructions to ascertain\r\nthe whereabouts of Dr. Jameson's force, and if possible to join them.\r\n\r\nThis was done without the authority of the Committee and in direct\r\nopposition to the line already decided upon. It was moreover\r\nconsidered to be taking a wholly unnecessary risk, in view of the\r\nfact that an attack upon the town was threatened by burgher forces on\r\nthe north-west side, and it was immediately decided by a number of\r\nmembers who heard of Colonel Rhodes' action to despatch a messenger\r\nordering the troop not to proceed more than ten miles from the town,\r\nbut to reconnoitre and ascertain what Dr. Jameson's position was,\r\nwith the reservation that, should it be found that he actually needed\r\nhelp, such assistance as was possible should of course be given him.\r\nAs a matter of hard fact it would not have been possible for the\r\ntroop to reach Dr. Jameson before his surrender, so that the action\r\ntaken upon the only message received from the invading force had no\r\npractical bearing upon the results.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on Thursday morning Mr. Lace and the despatch rider sent\r\nby the British Agent to deliver the High Commissioner's proclamation\r\nand the covering despatch were passed through the Dutch lines under\r\nthe authority of the Commandant-General, and they delivered the\r\ndocuments to Dr. Jameson in person. In reply to Sir Jacobus de Wet's\r\nappeal Dr. Jameson said, 'Tell Sir Jacobus de Wet that I have\r\nreceived his despatch; and that I shall see him in Pretoria\r\nto-morrow.' Mr. Lace briefly informed him of the position, as he had\r\nundertaken to do. The presence of a Boer escort and the shortness of\r\nthe time allowed for the delivery of the messages prevented any\r\nlengthy conversation. Dr. Jameson made no comment further than to\r\nsay, 'It is too late now,' and then asked the question, 'Where are\r\nthe troops?' to which Mr. Lace replied, 'What troops do you mean? We\r\nknow nothing about troops.' It did not occur to Mr. Lace or to\r\nanyone else that he could have meant 'troops' from Johannesburg. With\r\nthe receipt of Dr. Jameson's verbal reply to the British Agent's\r\ndespatch-carrier the business was concluded, and the escort from the\r\nBoer lines insisted on leaving, taking with them Mr. Lace and the\r\ndespatch-rider. He offered no further remark.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter V\r\n\r\n{22} The telegram originally read 'within twenty-four hours,' but\r\nit was considered impossible to guarantee the time exactly, and the\r\nalteration as above given was made, the word 'within' being\r\ninadvertently left standing instead of 'with.'\r\n\r\n{23} Captain Ferreira, at one time in command of the guard over the\r\nReformers, informed the writer that he had formed one of the cavalry\r\nescort. 'It is a good story,' he said, 'but what fools we would have\r\nbeen to send our guns shut up in trucks through a hostile camp of\r\n20,000 armed men--as we thought--round two sides of a triangle\r\ninstead of going by the shorter and safe road.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE INVASION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence on the trial at bar of Dr. Jameson and his\r\ncomrades, it appears that about 20th October, 1895, orders were given\r\nto the Matabeleland Border Police to move southward. After this,\r\nfurther mobilization of other bodies took place and during the first\r\nweek in December there collected at Pitsani Potlogo the body of men\r\nfrom whom Dr. Jameson's invading column was afterwards selected. For\r\nthree weeks the men were continuously drilled and practised in all\r\nwarlike exercises and thoroughly prepared for the enterprise which\r\ntheir leaders had in view. On Sunday, December 29, at about three in\r\nthe afternoon, the little force was paraded and Dr. Jameson read to\r\nthem the letter of invitation quoted in a previous chapter. He is\r\nalleged by certain witnesses to have said that he had just received\r\nthis and that they could not refuse to go to the assistance of their\r\ncountrymen in distress, and he confidently appealed to the men to\r\nsupport him. He said that he did not anticipate any bloodshed at all.\r\nThey would proceed by forced marching straight through to\r\nJohannesburg, and would reach that town before the Boers were aware\r\nof his movements, and certainly before they could concentrate to stop\r\nhim. It has been alleged by some witnesses that the men of the\r\nBechuanaland Border Police who advanced from Mafeking under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Grey and Major Coventry were not so fully informed\r\nas to their destination and the reasons for the movement until they\r\nwere actually in marching order to start. It would appear however\r\nfrom the general summary of the evidence and from the reports of\r\nthe men who took part in the expedition, that they were informed that\r\nthe destination of the force was Johannesburg, that the object was to\r\nrender assistance to their countrymen in that town who were being\r\ngrossly misruled by the Transvaal Government and were at that time in\r\ngrievous straits and peril through having endeavoured to assert their\r\nrights and obtain the reforms for which they had so long been\r\nagitating, and that the immediate reason for marching was the receipt\r\nof an urgent appeal from Johannesburg citizens, which appeal (the\r\nletter of invitation) was duly read to them. In reply to questions as\r\nto whether they were fighting under the Queen's orders, they were\r\ninformed that they were going to fight for the supremacy of the\r\nBritish flag in South Africa. A considerable proportion of the men\r\ndeclined to take part in the enterprise, and it is probably largely\r\ndue to defections at the last moment that the statement was made that\r\n700 men had started with Dr. Jameson, whereas it appears that only\r\n480 ever left the Protectorate.\r\n\r\nThe following is a portion of the Majority Report of the Select\r\nCommittee on the Jameson Raid appointed by the Cape House of\r\nAssembly:\r\n\r\nOn the 26th December there was a sudden check. On the afternoon of\r\nthat day Colonel Rhodes telegraphs to Charter, Capetown, 'It is\r\nabsolutely necessary to postpone flotation. Charles Leonard left last\r\nnight for Capetown.' Messages to the same effect were sent from Mr.\r\nS.W. Jameson to his brother, and from Dr. Harris for the Chartered\r\nCompany to Dr. Jameson, the latter concluding: 'So you must not move\r\ntill you hear from us again. Too awful. Very sorry.'\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the hitch that occurred, there is some light\r\nthrown on it by the statement from Mr. S.W. Jameson to his brother\r\nthat any movement must be postponed 'until we have C.J. Rhodes'\r\nabsolute pledge that authority of Imperial Government will not be\r\ninsisted on,' a point that is further alluded to in Telegram No.\r\n6,537 of Appendix QQ of the 28th December.\r\n\r\nWhatever the exact nature of the obstacle was, there can be no doubt\r\nthat some at least of the Johannesburg confederates were much alarmed\r\nand took all possible steps to stay proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn addition to urgent telegrams special messengers were sent to\r\nimpress on Dr. Jameson the necessity for delay. One of these, Captain\r\nHolden, made his way across country.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Hammond's evidence Holden arrived at Mafeking on the\r\n28th December, and went in with the column.\r\n\r\nThe other messenger was Captain Maurice Heany, who left Johannesburg\r\non the 26th December, and on the 27th telegraphed from Bloemfontein\r\nto Charter, Capetown, informing them that 'Zebrawood' (Colonel\r\nRhodes) had asked him to 'stop \"Zahlbar\" (Dr. Jameson) till Heany\r\nsees him,' and asking that a special train might be arranged for him.\r\nDr. Harris replied to Kimberley on the 28th informing him that a\r\nspecial train was arranged, and added, 'lose no time or you will be\r\nlate.'\r\n\r\nIt is in evidence that this special train was provided by the\r\nChartered Company, that Heany left by it, caught up the ordinary\r\ntrain at Vryburg, and that he reached Mafeking at 4.30 a.m. on\r\nSunday, the 29th.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is that he was coming with an urgent message to stop Dr.\r\nJameson; that on his arrival at Mafeking he waked up Mr. Isaacs, a\r\nlocal storekeeper, and purchased a pair of field boots and a\r\nkit-bag, and proceeded by special cart to Pitsani; and that he\r\nsubsequently on the same evening accompanied Dr. Jameson on his\r\ninroad and was captured at Doornkop.{24}\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, after receiving the discouraging telegrams mentioned\r\nabove from Johannesburg, Dr. Jameson telegraphed to Harris, Charter,\r\nCapetown, 'I am afraid of Bechuanaland Police for cutting wire. They\r\nhave now all gone forward, but will endeavour to put a stop to it.\r\nTherefore expect to receive telegram from you nine to-morrow morning\r\nauthorizing movements. Surely Col. F.W. Rhodes advisable to come to\r\nterms at once. Give guarantee, or you can telegraph before Charles\r\nLeonard arrived.' This doubtless alludes to the necessity for\r\nguarantee mentioned in the message from S.W. Jameson, and the\r\nalternative suggestion was that authority to proceed should be given\r\nbefore the arrival of the Johannesburg delegate at Capetown.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later on the same day he sends another message of the\r\nutmost importance. He informs Harris, Charter, Capetown, as follows:\r\n'If I cannot, as I expect, communicate with Bechuanaland Border\r\nPolice cutting, then we must carry into effect original plans. They\r\nhave then two days for flotation. If they do not, we will make our\r\nown flotation with help of letter, which I will publish.'\r\n\r\nOn the same day Dr. Jameson telegraphed to his brother in\r\nJohannesburg as follows: 'Guarantee already given, therefore let J.H.\r\nHammond telegraph instantly all right.'\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Hammond sent a most positive reply absolutely condemning\r\nhis proposed action.\r\n\r\nAs bearing upon the attitude of the force at Pitsani, it may be noted\r\nthat on the same day that the foregoing correspondence was taking\r\nplace, Mr. A. Bates was despatched from Mafeking into the Transvaal\r\nwith instructions from Major Raleigh Grey to collect information and\r\nmeet Dr. Jameson _en route._ He was supplied with a horse and money,\r\nand seems to have done his best to carry out instructions.\r\n\r\nEarly the next day Dr. Jameson telegraphed to Harris, Charter,\r\nCapetown: 'There will be no flotation if left to themselves; first\r\ndelay was races, which did not exist; second policies, already\r\narranged. All mean fear.{25} You had better go as quickly as possible\r\nand report fully, or tell Hon. C.J. Rhodes to allow me.'\r\n\r\nThe reply to this was: 'It is all right if you will only wait.\r\nCaptain Maurice Heany comes to you from Col. F.W. Rhodes by special\r\ntrain to-day.' And, again, two hours later, Dr. Harris for the\r\nChartered Company telegraphs: 'Goold Adams arrives Mafeking Monday,\r\nand Heany, I think, arrives to-night; after seeing him, you and we\r\nmust judge regarding flotation, but all our foreign friends are now\r\ndead against it and say public will not subscribe one penny towards\r\neven with you as a director--Ichabod.'\r\n\r\nStill on the same day two further telegrams to Dr. Jameson were sent\r\nfrom Capetown, almost together, of a strongly discouraging tenour.\r\nOne of them concludes by saying 'we cannot have fiasco,' and the\r\nother informs Dr. Jameson that Lionel Phillips anticipates complete\r\nfailure of any premature action.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Dr. Harris informs Colonel Rhodes at Johannesburg\r\nthat, 'Have arranged for Captain Maurice Heany; Dr. Jameson awaiting\r\nCapt. Maurice Heany's arrival. Keep market firm.'\r\n\r\nAnd later:\r\n\r\n'Charles Leonard says flotation not popular, and England's bunting\r\nwill be resisted by public. Is it true? Consult all our friends and\r\nlet me know, as Dr. Jameson is quite ready to move resolution and is\r\nonly waiting for Captain Heany's arrival.'\r\n\r\nA few hours later Dr. Jameson telegraphs to Harris, Charter,\r\nCapetown: 'Received your telegram Ichabod _re_ Capt. Maurice Heany.\r\nHave no further news. I require to know. Unless I hear definitely to\r\nthe contrary, shall leave to-morrow evening and carry into effect my\r\nsecond telegram (Appendix QQ, No. 06365) of yesterday to you, and it\r\nwill be all right.'\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, Sunday the 29th, Heany arrived at Mafeking, and\r\nafter making the purchases detailed above, left by special cart for\r\nthe camp at Pitsani, where he probably arrived about eight o'clock\r\na.m. At five minutes past nine Dr. Jameson telegraphed to Harris,\r\nCharter, Capetown: 'Shall leave to-night for the Transvaal. My reason\r\nis the final arrangement with writers of letter was that, without\r\nfurther reference to them, in case I should hear at some future time\r\nthat suspicions have been aroused as to their intention among the\r\nTransvaal authorities, I was to start immediately to prevent loss of\r\nlives, as letter states. Reuter only just received. Even without my\r\nown information of meeting in the Transvaal, compel immediate move\r\nto fulfil promise made. We are simply going to protect everybody\r\nwhile they change the present dishonest Government and take vote from\r\nthe whole country as to form of Government required by the whole.'\r\n\r\nThe force took with them provisions for one day only, relying on the\r\ncommissariat arrangements made on their behalf by Dr. Wolff _en\r\nroute._ They were well mounted and armed with Lee-Metford carbines,\r\nand took with them eight Maxims, two seven-pounders and one\r\ntwelve-pounder. In order to facilitate quick movement no heavy\r\nequipment was taken, and but little spare ammunition. The vehicles\r\nattending the column were six Scotch carts and one Cape cart. The\r\ntotal distance to be covered was about 170 miles to Johannesburg, or\r\n150 miles to Krugersdorp. The start was made from Pitsani shortly\r\nafter 5 p.m., and marching was continued throughout the night. The\r\nforce consisted of about 350 of the Chartered forces under Colonel\r\nSir John Willoughby, Major in the Royal Horse Guards; the Hon. H. F.\r\nWhite, Major 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards; Hon. R. White, Captain\r\nRoyal Welsh Fusiliers; Major J. B. Tracey, 2nd Battalion Scots\r\nGuards; Captain C. H. Villiers, Royal Horse Guards; and 120 of the\r\nBechuanaland Border Police under Major Raleigh Grey, Captain 6th\r\nInniskillen Dragoons, and the Hon. C. J. Coventry, Captain 3rd\r\nMilitia Battalion Worcester Regiment. The two contingents met at\r\nMalmani at about sunrise on Monday morning, December 30. They marched\r\nthroughout that day and night and the following day, Tuesday. There\r\nwere half-hour rests about every twenty miles for rationing the men\r\nand feeding and watering the horses, the fodder being ready for the\r\nhorses at various stores. Provisions for the men consisted of tinned\r\nmeats and biscuits. There was no lack of provisions at all; but the\r\nmen complained afterwards that they were so overcome with fatigue\r\nfrom continuous marching that when they reached the resting-places\r\nthey generally lay down where they dismounted, and slept, instead of\r\ntaking the food which was ready for them. A serious fault in the\r\nconduct of the expedition appears to have been the lack of\r\nopportunity for rest and food afforded the men. It was contended that\r\nthe same or a higher average of speed might have been attained by\r\npressing on faster for spells of a few hours and allowing reasonable\r\nintervals for rest and refreshment. Only about 130 miles had been\r\ncovered by the column during the seventy hours that they were on the\r\nmarch before they were first checked by any serious opposition from\r\nthe Boers.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, December 30, at about 1 p.m., Mr. F.J. Newton, Resident\r\nCommissioner at Mafeking, received the following telegram from the\r\nHigh Commissioner, Capetown, dated the same day:\r\n\r\nIt is rumoured here that Dr. Jameson has entered the Transvaal with\r\nan armed force. Is this so? If so, send special messenger on fast\r\nhorse directing him to return immediately. A copy of this telegram\r\nshould be sent to the officers with him, and they should be told that\r\nthis violation of the territory of a friendly State is repudiated by\r\nHer Majesty's Government, and that they are rendering themselves\r\nliable to severe penalties.\r\n\r\nMr. Newton at once addressed to Dr. Jameson and each of the chief\r\nofficers with him the following letter:\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to enclose copy of a telegram which I have received\r\nfrom His Excellency the High Commissioner, and I have accordingly to\r\nrequest that you will immediately comply with His Excellency's\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nTrooper J.T. White was despatched as soon as possible with the five\r\nletters, enclosed in waterproof, with instructions to ride until he\r\ncaught up to Dr. Jameson and delivered the letters. He was stopped by\r\na party of armed Boers and taken before Landdrost Marais at Malmani,\r\nwhere the despatches were opened and read. He was delayed for four\r\nhours, and then allowed to proceed with an escort. On Tuesday morning\r\nhe crossed the Elands River and caught up the column at about 11 a.m.\r\nHe had ridden all night, covering about eighty miles. He alleges that\r\nat first the officers would not take the letters, but eventually Sir\r\nJohn Willoughby accepted and read his and the others followed suit.\r\nHe stated that he had been instructed to deliver the letters\r\npersonally, and to get a reply. Sir John Willoughby sent a message by\r\nhim stating that the despatches would be attended to. Shortly after\r\nthis Dr. Jameson also received a protest from the Commandant of the\r\nMarico district against his invasion of the State, to which he\r\nsent the following reply:\r\n\r\n  _December 30, 1895._\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your protest of the above date, and have to inform\r\nyou that I intend proceeding with my original plans, which have no\r\nhostile intention against the people of the Transvaal; but we are\r\nhere in reply to an invitation from the principal residents of the\r\nRand to assist them in their demand for justice and the ordinary\r\nrights of every citizen of a civilized State.\r\n\r\n  Yours faithfully\r\n  L.S. JAMESON.\r\n\r\nWhite states that this was about noon, and 'then the bugle sounded\r\nand the column moved off.' The force continued advancing in much the\r\nsame way throughout Tuesday, and at 6 p.m. a skirmisher of the\r\nadvanced guard met Lieutenant Eloff of the Krugersdorp District\r\nPolice, who had been instructed by his Government to ride to\r\nMafeking, presumably for the purpose of getting information. He had\r\ncome with a guard of nine men, whom he had left some distance off;\r\nadvancing alone to meet the column. He states that when released\r\nafter two hours' delay he left the forces, and passing along the\r\nRustenburg road met a commando of some 300 Boers with whom he made a\r\ncircuit to avoid the column, and reached Krugersdorp before it did.\r\nFrom this it is clear that the Boers were collecting in considerable\r\nnumbers to meet the invading force, and were moving with much greater\r\nrapidity than their enemies.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, at about 5.30, Messrs. Theron and Bouwer\r\n(despatch riders), who had been sent by Sir Jacobus de Wet, British\r\nAgent at Pretoria, at 1.30 p.m. on the previous day with a despatch\r\nfor Dr. Jameson, reached the column and delivered their letters, and\r\nstated that they had been instructed to take back a reply as soon as\r\npossible. Dr. Jameson said, 'All right; I'll give you a reply,' and\r\nwithin a few minutes he handed to them the following letter:\r\n\r\n  _January 1._\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of the message you sent from His Excellency the High\r\nCommissioner, and beg to reply, for His Excellency's information,\r\nthat I should, of course, desire to obey his instructions, but, as I\r\nhave a very large force of both men and horses to feed, and having\r\nfinished all my supplies in the rear, must perforce proceed to\r\nKrugersdorp or Johannesburg this morning for this purpose. At the\r\nsame time I must acknowledge I am anxious to fulfil my promise on the\r\npetition of the principal residents of the Rand, to come to the aid\r\nof my fellow-men in their extremity. I have molested no one, and have\r\nexplained to all Dutchmen met that the above is my sole object, and\r\nthat I shall desire to return at once to the Protectorate. I am,\r\netc.,\r\n\r\n  (Signed) L.S. JAMESON.\r\n\r\nAt about 10.30 a.m. on the same day (January 1) two cyclists, Messrs.\r\nCelliers and Rowland, carrying despatches from members of the Reform\r\nCommittee, met the column. The letters were received by Dr. Jameson,\r\nand taken with him as far as Doornkop, where, upon surrender of the\r\nforce, they appear to have been torn up. With that good fortune which\r\nseems to have followed the Boers throughout this business, these torn\r\nfragments were picked up on the battle-field by a Boer official four\r\nmonths later, having remained undisturbed during the severe rain and\r\nwind storms of the wet season. Some portions were missing, but the\r\nothers were pieced together and produced in evidence against the\r\nReform prisoners. The letters are printed hereunder as they were\r\nwritten, as testified by the writers, and, in the case of the first\r\none, by others who read it before it was despatched. The italics\r\nrepresent the fragments of the letters which were never found:{26}\r\n\r\nDEAR DR.\r\n\r\nThe rumour of massa_cre in_ Johannesburg that started yo_u to_ our\r\nrelief was not true. We a_re all_ right, feeling intense. We have\r\narmed a lot of men.

The letters however were written on Tuesday the 31st, when\r\nthere was a general belief that Dr. Jameson had started in good\r\nfaith, misled by some false reports. In the second letter Colonel\r\nRhodes expresses the opinion that it was wrong to agree to send in\r\na deputation to meet the Government. This was written before the\r\ndeputation had gone to Pretoria, and clearly implies that the moral\r\neffect of treating would be bad. The phrasing also shows that the\r\nso-called armistice was for the purpose of treating, and not the\r\ntreating for the purpose of securing an armistice: in other words,\r\nthat the armistice would expire, and not commence, with the treating.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence given by the cyclist Rowland, it appears that he\r\nstated to Dr. Jameson that he could get 2,000{29} armed men to go out\r\nto his assistance; and Rowland in evidence alleged further that there\r\nwas some offer of assistance in one of the despatches, and that Dr.\r\nJameson, in reply, said he did not need any assistance, but that if\r\n2,000 men should come out probably the Boers would draw off. This\r\nwitness in his evidence at Bow Street also alleged that one of the\r\ndespatches expressed surprise at Dr. Jameson's movement. There is now\r\na complete record of these despatches. They make no allusions to\r\ngiving assistance, and the Johannesburg leaders are very clear on the\r\npoint that no promise or offer of assistance was ever made. The reply\r\nwhich Dr. Jameson caused to be sent was concealed in one of the\r\nbicycles, which were seized by the Boer authorities on the return\r\nride of the despatch-carriers, and was not brought to light until the\r\nfollowing March, when a mechanic who was repairing the broken bicycle\r\ndiscovered it.\r\n\r\nThe much-debated question of whether assistance was ever promised or\r\nexpected should be finally disposed of by the publication of two\r\ndocuments which have not heretofore appeared in print. They are _(a)_\r\nthe reply of Dr. Jameson to Colonel Rhodes' letters, and _(b)_ the\r\nreport of Mr. Celliers, the cyclist despatch-rider who took the\r\nletter and received the reply, which report was taken down in\r\nshorthand by the clerks in the Reform Committee room as it was\r\nmade verbally by him immediately on his return. Both these records\r\ndispose of Mr. Rowland's statement about 2,000 men; and apart from\r\nthis it should be observed that Mr. Celliers was the messenger sent\r\nby Colonel Rhodes and not Mr. Rowland; the latter having been later\r\non picked up 'for company,' was presumably less qualified to speak\r\nabout the instructions and messages than Celliers, from whom indeed\r\nhe learned all that he knew.\r\n\r\nThe letter was written by Col. H. F. White in the presence of the\r\ncyclists, and partly at the dictation of Dr. Jameson. It was in the\r\nform of a memorandum from Col. H. F. White to Col. Frank Rhodes, and\r\nbore no signature; but the last line was in Dr. Jameson's\r\nhandwriting, and was initialed by him. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\nAs you may imagine, we are all well pleased by your letter. We have\r\nhad some fighting, and hope to reach Johannesburg to-night, but of\r\ncourse it will depend on the amount of fighting we have. Of course we\r\nshall be pleased to have 200 men meet us at Krugersdorp, as it will\r\ngreatly encourage the men, who are in great heart although a bit\r\ntired. Love to Sam, Phillips, and rest,\r\n\r\n  L. S. J.\r\n\r\nMr. Celliers' report--after detailing the incidents of the ride\r\nout--runs:\r\n\r\n... I reached the column between 9 and 10 o'clock. I saw Dr. Jameson\r\npersonally. He received us very well, and was very glad with the news\r\nI brought him. He read the despatch, and asked me for full details. I\r\ntold him the strength of the Boers and the dangers he was in. I told\r\nhim that they had no guns, and all that I saw and heard that they had\r\nduring my travels. I explained to him everything in detail. The\r\nDoctor seemed to be very brave. He told me that he had two\r\nscrimmages, and that no damage had been done. I said to him whether\r\nit would not be well for him to halt until we got through and sent\r\nhim some help. The Doctor said he did not think there was anything to\r\nfear, and at the same time he did not want to go to Johannesburg as a\r\npirate, and it would be well for them to send some men to meet him. I\r\nalso made inquiries as to whether I could return by any other road,\r\nbut found it was impossible, and that we had to come back the same\r\nway. I got his despatch, shook hands with him, wished us well, and\r\nset on our journey back.\r\n\r\nThe report, which is given above literally as transcribed from the\r\nshorthand notes, concludes with an account of the return journey.\r\nMr. Celliers in a subsequent statement confirmed the above,\r\nand added:\r\n\r\nThe impression which the Doctor gave me most certainly was that he\r\nhad never expected help and did not want it.{30}\r\n\r\nThe march continued on towards Krugersdorp. At one or two places a\r\nfew shots were fired by Boer pickets, and on one occasion the Maxims\r\nof the invading force were turned on a party of some fifty Boers\r\nensconced in a good position. No casualties however occurred until\r\nKrugersdorp was reached at 3 p.m. on Wednesday. A message was sent by\r\nSir John Willoughby to the authorities at Krugersdorp that if he\r\nencountered any opposition he would shell the town, and he warned\r\nthem to have their women and children removed.\r\n\r\nShortly after mid-day positions were taken up on the hills pear\r\nKrugersdorp, and at three o'clock severe fighting took place which\r\nlasted well on into the night. An ambush at the crushing mill and\r\nworks of the Queen's Mine was shelled and an attempt was made to\r\nstorm it by a small party of the invaders. It was unsuccessful\r\nhowever, and after nightfall Dr. Jameson's force was obliged to\r\nretreat from its position and seek a more advantageous one on higher\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThey had suffered a reverse at the hands of a somewhat larger force\r\nof Boers who had selected a very strong position. Firing did not\r\ncease until 11 p.m. Here it is alleged the fatal military mistake of\r\nthe expedition was committed. No precautions had been taken to\r\nascertain the road. Instead of being well acquainted with the\r\ndirection to be taken the force was dependent upon a guide picked up\r\non the spot, a man who was never seen after the events of the\r\nfollowing day and is freely alleged to have been a Boer agent. It is\r\nstated by competent judges that, had Dr. Jameson's force pushed on\r\nduring the night on the main road to Johannesburg, they would have\r\nsucceeded in reaching that town without difficulty. As it was however\r\nthey camped for the night in the direction of Randfontein and in the\r\nearly morning struck away south, attempting a big detour to avoid the\r\nroad which they had tried to force the previous night. There is but\r\nlittle doubt that they were shepherded into the position in which\r\nthey were called upon to fight at Doornkop. The following description\r\nof the Doornkop fight was written by Captain Frank Younghusband, the\r\ncorrespondent of the London _Times_, who was an eye-witness:\r\n\r\nGalloping over the rolling open grassy downs in search of Dr.\r\nJameson's force which was expected to arrive at Johannesburg at any\r\nmoment, my companion Heygate and myself saw between us two forces,\r\nboth stationary. Then one began to move away and from the regularity\r\nof its movement we recognized that this must be Dr. Jameson's trying\r\nto round the opposing Boer forces. We found a Boer guard holding the\r\nonly ford across the stream; so going up to the Commander we asked\r\nfor news. He, after questioning us, told us all that had occurred.\r\n\r\nHe was a field-cornet from Potchefstroom, and leader of one division\r\nof the Boers. He said that yesterday, January 1, Dr. Jameson had\r\nattacked the Boer force at the George and May Mine, two miles\r\nnorth-west of Krugersdorp, a small mining township twenty-one miles\r\nwest of Johannesburg. Fighting took place from three in the afternoon\r\nto eleven at night, Dr. Jameson making three principal attacks, and\r\ndoing great damage with his artillery, which the Boers, having then\r\nno guns, were unable to reply to.\r\n\r\nMy informant, the Boer leader, said that both then and to-day Dr.\r\nJameson's men behaved with great gallantry, and he also said that\r\nadmirable arrangements had been made at Krugersdorp for nursing the\r\nwounded on both sides.\r\n\r\nThis morning the Boers took up a position at Vlakfontein, eight miles\r\non the Johannesburg side of Krugersdorp, on a circuitous road to the\r\nsouth by which Dr. Jameson was marching. The Boers in the night had\r\nbeen reinforced by men and with artillery and Maxims. Their position\r\nwas an exceedingly strong one on an open slope, but along a ridge of\r\nrocks cropping out of it. It was a right-angled position and Dr.\r\nJameson attacked them in the re-entering angle, thus having fire on\r\nhis front and flank.\r\n\r\nTo attack this position his men had to advance over a perfectly open\r\ngently-sloping grassy down, while the Boers lay hid behind rocks and\r\nfired with rifles, Maxims, and artillery upon their assailants. The\r\nBoers numbered from 1,200 to 1,500, Dr. Jameson's force about 500,\r\nand the position was practically unassailable.\r\n\r\nDr. Jameson, after making a desperate effort to get through,\r\nsurrendered, and as we stood we saw his brave little band riding\r\ndejectedly back again to Krugersdorp without their arms and\r\nsurrounded by a Boer escort.\r\n\r\nWe were allowed to ride close up, but were refused permission to see\r\nDr. Jameson. It is therefore impossible to state his full reasons,\r\nbut it is known that he was made aware that it was impossible to send\r\nassistance from here, and this may have influenced him in giving\r\nup the contest when he found the enemy's position so strong that\r\nin any case it would have been no disgrace to have been beaten by\r\nsuperior numbers of such a brave foe as that Boer force which I\r\nsaw in the very position they had fought in. It was evident that\r\nprobably no one had ever started on a more desperate venture than\r\nhad this daring little force, and they gained by their gallantry the\r\nadoration, not only of the Boer burghers who spoke to me, but of the\r\nwhole town of Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nThese Boers--rough, simple men, dressed in ordinary civilian clothes,\r\nwith merely a rifle slung over the shoulder to show they were\r\nsoldiers--spoke in feeling terms of the splendid bravery shown by\r\ntheir assailants. They were perfectly calm and spoke without any\r\nboastfulness in a self-reliant way. They said, pointing to the\r\nground, that the thing was impossible, and hence the present result.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of Dr. Jameson's force is about twenty. Major Grey\r\nwas, they said, the principal military officer, and they thought that\r\nno officer was killed, and that the report that Sir John Willoughby\r\nhad been killed was unfounded. He and Dr. Jameson have been taken to\r\nPretoria.\r\n\r\nAt 9.15 o'clock the white flag was put up. Sir J. Willoughby, the\r\nofficer in command of the force, then sent the following note\r\naddressed to the Commandant of the Transvaal Forces:\r\n\r\nWe surrender, provided that you guarantee us safe conduct out of the\r\ncountry for every member of the force.\r\n\r\n  JOHN C. WILLOUGHBY.\r\n\r\nA reply was sent within fifteen minutes, of which the following is a\r\nliteral translation:\r\n\r\nOFFICER,--Please take note that I shall immediately assemble our\r\nofficers to decide upon your communication.\r\n\r\n  COMMANDANT.\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty minutes later a second note was received by the\r\nsurrendering force, addressed 'John C. Willoughby':\r\n\r\nI acknowledge your letter. The answer is that, if you will undertake\r\nto pay the expense which you have caused the South African Republic,\r\nand if you will surrender with your arms, then I shall spare the\r\nlives of you and yours. Please send me a reply to this within thirty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n  P. A. CRONJÉ.\r\n  _Commandant, Potchefstroom._\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen minutes of the receipt of this letter, Sir J.\r\nWilloughby replied, accepting the conditions in the following terms:\r\n\r\nI accept the terms on the guarantee that the lives of all will be\r\nspared. I now await your instructions as to how and where we are to\r\nlay down our arms. At the same time I would ask you to remember that\r\nmy men have been without food for the last twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n'The flag sent with the first message (to quote the statement made on\r\nbehalf of Sir J. Willoughby by his solicitor, Mr. B.F. Hawksley) was\r\nsent perhaps a little earlier than 9.15. Dr. Jameson's force ceased\r\nfiring as soon as the flag was hoisted, except on the extreme right.\r\nMessengers were sent to stop that firing, and all firing ceased\r\nwithin five minutes. The Boers continued to fire for some ten\r\nminutes, and for some time after Jameson's force had ceased. After\r\nSir J. Willoughby had received the first answer the State Artillery\r\nopened fire and continued firing for at least fifteen minutes. Sir J.\r\nWilloughby sent Colonel the Hon. H. White and Captain Grenfell to the\r\nCommandant with a note requesting to know the reason for firing on a\r\nflag of truce, and requesting that it might cease. Sir J. Willoughby\r\nhas no copy of the letter he wrote accepting the conditions offered\r\nby Cronjé, but it was to the effect above given. 'Besides Cronjé,\r\nCommandant Malan was acquainted with the terms of surrender, for\r\n_after Jameson's force had given up their arms_ Commandant Malan came\r\nup and repudiated part of the terms, saying he would not guarantee\r\nthe lives of Jameson and the leaders, and that they would be handed\r\nover to General Joubert, who would decide their fate.'\r\n\r\nThe decision having been announced to the forces, and many of the men\r\nhaving stacked their arms and dropped off to sleep where they lay in\r\nthe veld, several other commandants joined Cronjé, and an altercation\r\ntook place in the presence of the surrendered officers, Commandant\r\nMalan of Rustenburg violently proclaiming that Cronjé had no\r\nright to spare the lives of the force, and that it lay with the\r\nCommandant-General and Krijgsraad (or War Council) to decide what\r\nshould be done with the prisoners. Commandant Cronjé replied that\r\nthey had surrendered to him upon certain conditions, and those\r\nconditions had been accepted by him. In the course of the discussion,\r\nin which several other prominent Boers joined, disapproval was\r\ngenerally expressed of Cronjé's acceptance of the terms and threats\r\nwere used to Dr. Jameson in person. Eye-witnesses on the Boer\r\nside state that Dr. Jameson declined to discuss the matter further;\r\nhe merely bowed and walked away. It may be remarked that it is not by\r\nany means unusual for the Boers to seek to stretch to their advantage\r\nterms which they have previously agreed upon. There can now be no\r\nquestion as to the conditions of the surrender. The officer in\r\ncommand on the field agreed to spare the lives of the entire force,\r\nand it was not competent for anyone to reverse that decision or to\r\nreopen the question. The incident is instructive, and also important\r\nsince the lives of Dr. Jameson and his men were made to play a\r\nconsiderable part in President Kruger's game of magnanimity later\r\non.{31}\r\n\r\nThe Johannesburg _Star_ correspondent, describing the surrender,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\nThere were upwards of 400 altogether, and the poor fellows made a\r\nsorry sight--tired from their long march, their privations, and the\r\ntremendous strain of continuous engagements for nearly twenty-four\r\nhours. Some almost slept in their saddles as they were being\r\nescorted; and when they arrived on Krugersdorp Market Square the\r\nscene will not soon be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Boers freely mixed with them and talked with them. Provisions\r\nwere brought, and devoured with ravenous hunger. In many cases the\r\nBoers gave from their own scant stock of provisions to the starving\r\nmen, for whom they expressed the utmost admiration for their\r\npluckiness and determination.\r\n\r\nDr. Jameson and his principal officers, including Sir John\r\nWilloughby, were brought in separately from the main body of the\r\ncaptured troops. Although the Boers treated most of the prisoners\r\nwith consideration, they jeered somewhat when Dr. Jameson was brought\r\nforward; but this was promptly suppressed by the Commandants. Dr.\r\nJameson and the officers were temporarily housed in the Court-house,\r\ntogether with the other officers captured previously.\r\n\r\nA mule-waggon was brought up, fitted with mattresses. The chief\r\nofficers were despatched to Pretoria under a strong escort of Boers.\r\nAbout half an hour later the rest of the prisoners were also escorted\r\nout of the town to Pretoria, most of them on their own horses. Both\r\nmen and horses were extremely emaciated.\r\n\r\nThe burgher losses were reported to have been 4 killed and 5 wounded.\r\nThe losses of Dr. Jameson's force were 18 killed and about 40\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThere were also taken: 400 magazine and Lee-Metford rifles, 8 Maxims\r\n(one spiked, or with the breach-piece gone), 4 field-pieces, 33,000\r\nrifle cartridges, 10 cases of Maxim cartridges, 10 cases of\r\nprojectiles, 2 sacks of projectiles, 300 cartridge-belts, 13\r\nrevolvers, 4 mule-waggons, 5 Scotch carts, 742 horses (in which were\r\nincluded the 250 horses which were captured in charge of two troopers\r\nnear Blaaubank), a full-blooded stallion (the property of Dr.\r\nJameson), 400 saddles, bridles etc., 38 mules with harness, 1\r\ntelegraph instrument (probably to tap wires with), harness and other\r\naccoutrements and instruments of war.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were treated with every consideration by their captors,\r\nwith the exception perhaps of Dr. Jameson himself, who was threatened\r\nby some of the unruly ones and freely hissed and hooted, but was\r\nprotected by the officers in charge. It must be said of the Boers\r\nthat they acted with admirable self-restraint and dignity in a\r\nposition such as very few are called upon to face. However politic\r\ntheir actions may have been in their fear of provoking conflict with\r\nJohannesburg and the Imperial Government, however the juggling with\r\nDr. Jameson's life afterwards and the spurious magnanimity so freely\r\nadvertized, may detract from what they did and may tend to bring\r\nridicule and suspicion upon them, one cannot review the broad facts\r\nof the Jameson invasion, and realize a position which, if only for\r\nthe moment, gave the aggrieved party unlimited scope for revenge upon\r\nan aggressor who had not the semblance of personal wrong or interest\r\nnor the pretext of duty to justify his action, without allowing to\r\nthe Boers that they behaved in such a manner as, for a time, to\r\nsilence even that criticism which is logically justifiable and\r\nultimately imperative. In so far as the invading force are concerned,\r\nthe words of Mr. A. J. Balfour aptly sum up the position: 'President\r\nKruger has shown himself to possess a generosity which is not the\r\nless to be admired because it is coincident with the highest\r\npolitical wisdom.'\r\n\r\nWith reference to the surrender of the force, it is reasonable to\r\nbelieve that the Transvaal Government, knowing how serious the\r\ncomplications would be if civil war actually took place, and\r\nbelieving as they undoubtedly did that Johannesburg contained upwards\r\nof 20,000 armed men, were quite willing--indeed anxious--to secure\r\nthe surrender of Dr. Jameson's force on any terms, and that the\r\nconditions made by Cronjé were quite in accordance with what the\r\nhighest Boer authorities would have accepted. It seems to be beyond\r\nquestion also that the conditions of surrender were purposely\r\nsuppressed in order to enable the President to bargain with\r\nJohannesburg; and, as has already been stated, such action\r\nmaterially detracted from the credit due to the Transvaal Government.\r\nThis is their characteristic diplomacy--the fruit of generations of\r\nsharpening wits against savages; and the same is called Kaffir\r\ncunning, and is not understood at first by European people. But when\r\nall such considerations are weighed, there is still a large balance\r\nof credit due to the Boers for the manner in which they treated\r\nDr. Jameson and his invading force. It is difficult to conceive of\r\nany people behaving better to a foe vanquished under such conditions;\r\nindeed, it would be quite impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Boers when under control of their leaders have generally behaved\r\nin an admirable manner. It is only when the individuals, unrestrained\r\nby those in authority, are left to exercise their power at the\r\ndictates of their own uncurbed passions, that the horrible scenes\r\nhave occurred which have undoubtedly blemished their reputation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Jameson raid there was one such incident--the\r\nshooting of Trooper Black. The unfortunate man fell into the hands of\r\nthe Boers while out scouting and was taken as a prisoner to a\r\nfarmhouse near Blaaubank. There he was tied up and beaten, and it is\r\nstated by a woman who gave him water when he was half mad with\r\nthirst, that his face had been smashed by a blow from a rifle butt.\r\nWhen unable to bear the treatment any longer Black stood up and,\r\ntearing his shirt open, cried out, 'Don't shoot me in the back! Shoot\r\nhere! My heart's in the right place.' He was then untied and (as\r\nalleged by Dutch witnesses) given an opportunity to escape. He\r\nmounted his horse, but before he had gone far was shot dead. On the\r\nappeal of Sir Jacobus de Wet the Government consented to investigate\r\nthe matter; but the Commandant in charge, Piet Grobler, when\r\nquestioned on the subject, merely replied, 'Oh, he [Black] was a very\r\ninsolent fellow. We could do nothing with him.' The man who fired the\r\nshot despatching Black, a half-caste Boer named Graham, stated on his\r\nreturn from Pretoria that he was asked no questions at the so-called\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar incident took place, but fortunately with less\r\nserious results, on the way from the battle of Krugersdorp. A\r\nwell-known resident of Johannesburg had ridden out to ascertain news\r\nof Dr. Jameson, and, arriving as the surrender took place, thrust his\r\nway among the Boers until he reached the Doctor, where he was\r\narrested by the Boer authorities as a spy. Being a burgher of the\r\nState who had been resident in the Transvaal for some sixteen or\r\nseventeen years, he was recognized and rather harshly treated. He was\r\nattached by a leather thong to the saddle of one of the Boer\r\nCommandants and made to run, keeping pace with the horse. After a\r\nspell of this treatment he was released, and the Commandant in\r\nquestion offered to make a bet with him that he would not be able to\r\nrace him on horseback to the ambulance waggons a few hundred yards\r\noff, the prisoner to take a short cut across a swamp and the\r\nCommandant to ride round by the road. The prisoner thereupon replied,\r\n'No, thank you, Commandant. I was in the Boer War myself and saw\r\nseveral men shot by that dodge, on the pretence that they were\r\nescaping.' The worthy Commandant thereupon drew his stirrup from the\r\nsaddle, and thrashed his prisoner with the stirrup end. After some\r\nten days' imprisonment under exceptionally hard conditions the\r\ngentleman in question was released without trial.\r\n\r\nThe complete success of the Boer forces against Dr. Jameson's band\r\nhas been accounted for in many ways, but undoubtedly the one reason,\r\nif one can be selected, which enabled them to deal with the invaders,\r\nwas their ability to mobilize at short notice. And in this connection\r\narises the question: Did the Boers know beforehand of the intended\r\ninvasion, and were they waiting until Dr. Jameson should walk into\r\nthe trap? On behalf of the Boers it is strenuously maintained that\r\nthey had not the remotest notion of what was brewing, and that had\r\nsuch an idea occurred to them they would of course have reported\r\nmatters to the High Commissioner. The President's unyielding mood\r\nbefore he heard of Dr. Jameson's start, and his change afterwards,\r\nthe state of demoralization in Pretoria, the unpreparedness of the\r\nState Artillery, and the vacillation of General Joubert, the\r\ncondition of alarm in which the President was during that night of\r\nsuspense before the surrender, when Chief Justice Kotzé sat with him\r\nto aid and cheer, and when the old white horse stood saddled in the\r\nstable in case Johannesburg should attack Pretoria; all point to the\r\nconclusion that it was not all cut and dried. With a singular\r\nunanimity, the Boers and their friends and the majority of the\r\nUitlanders in the Transvaal support this view; but there are on\r\nrecord certain facts which are not to be ignored. Apart altogether\r\nfrom the hearsay evidence of telegraphists and Boer officials in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, who state that they were under\r\norders from Government to remain at their posts day and night--that\r\nis to say to sleep in their offices--a fortnight before the Jameson\r\nraid took place, a significant piece of evidence is that supplied by\r\nthe Transvaal Consul in London, Mr. Montagu White, who in a letter to\r\nthe London Press stated that on December 16 he received information\r\nas to the plot against the independence of the Republic, and that he\r\non that date cabled fully to President Kruger warning him of what was\r\nin contemplation, and that the President took the necessary\r\nprecautions. Now, on December 14 it was announced in Pretoria that\r\nthe President, being greatly in need of a rest and change, was about\r\nto undertake a tour through the country to visit his faithful\r\nburghers. Perusal of the newspapers of the time shows that among the\r\nUitlanders no significance was attached to this visit. Indeed, the\r\nUitlander press agreed that it had become painfully evident that His\r\nHonour required a change in order to restore his nervous system. As\r\nnothing can better represent the opinions of the time than the\r\ncurrent comments of the Press, the following extracts from the\r\nJohannesburg _Star_ are given:\r\n\r\nIn short, His Honour is developing an ungovernable irritability and a\r\ntendency to choleric obsessions, when the word 'Uitlander' is barely\r\nmentioned in his presence, that are causing the greatest concern to\r\nthose around him. Only on some such grounds are explicable the raging\r\nexclamations he is reported to have permitted himself to lately use\r\ntowards Johannesburg and the cause of reform upon which it is so\r\nearnestly engaged. That His Honour should have been generally\r\ncredited with indulging in unconventional vernacular terms concerning\r\nthe pronouncedly loyal and hearty reception accorded to him on his\r\nvisit to the Rand Agricultural Show, seems to argue a lapse into the\r\nhabits of his youngest days, which has a direct significance in the\r\ncase of ordinary individuals, and is known by a very familiar name.\r\nThat he should tragically declare that only across his bleeding\r\ncorpse will the Uitlander ever come into his own, is merely the\r\nextravagant and regrettable melodrama of an overheated mind. The\r\ngeneral desire is quite averse to encountering any stepping-stones of\r\nthat kind, and most of all averse to Mr. Kruger's taking any such\r\nplace. Our quarrel is with principles and systems, and never yet has\r\na note of personal vengeance been sounded whilst we have endeavoured\r\nto compass their destruction. It is quite obvious that a little\r\nrelaxation from the cares of State, or reversion to more primitive\r\nconditions, a freer communion with Nature--viewed from an\r\nox-waggon--are eminently desirable to restore His Honour's shattered\r\nnerves.--_December 14, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT HIS POST.\r\n\r\nHis Honour the President has returned to the seat of Government. The\r\nitinerary appears to have been somewhat prematurely cut short; but no\r\none is likely to so ridiculously underestimate the sterling qualities\r\nof His Honour as to conceive the possibility of his absence when\r\ndifficulty and danger imperatively command his presence at the head\r\nof public affairs. The conclusions which Mr. Kruger has derived from\r\nconverse with his faithful burghers are likely to remain buried in\r\nhis own breast. The outward and ostensible object of his recent tour\r\nhas been fulfilled in much the accustomed manner; that is to say, he\r\nhas discussed with apparent interest the necessity for a pont here or\r\na bridge there; the desirability of Government aid for tree-planting,\r\nthe trouble which the farmers experience in getting native labour,\r\nand so forth, and so on; but we must not derive from all this\r\nperipatetic fustian the erroneous impression that His Honour has been\r\nvacuously fiddling on the eve of a conflagration. The real business\r\nwhich took him to Lydenburg and Middelburg has no doubt been\r\nsatisfactorily accomplished. Boer sentiment has been tested in\r\nsecret, and the usual professions of fervid patriotism and of\r\nreadiness for target practice with the Uitlander as the mark have\r\nbeen profusely evoked. This sub-official aspect of the itinerary has\r\nbeen discreetly veiled in all the reports which have been permitted\r\nto transpire, and the censorship thereof has been more than normally\r\nexacting and severe; but we are from private sources left in no\r\nmanner of doubt that Mr. Kruger has been canvassing and stimulating\r\nthe Boers to be ready for any emergency, and has been metaphorically\r\nplanting a war-beacon on every hill. All scrutiny and inquiry fail to\r\ndiscover that he has uttered one single word which can be described\r\nas an emollient to the present critical situation. He has pandered\r\nrather to the worst racial passions of the Boer, instead of using the\r\nenormous responsibility resting upon him in the direction of\r\nmediation. Old patriarchs--whom we cannot but respect and admire\r\nwhilst we deplore their immitigable and hopeless rancour against the\r\ncause of the newcomer--have been permitted, apparently without\r\nrebuke, to show their wounds to the younger and more malleable\r\ngeneration in His Honour's presence, and to boast of their readiness\r\nto receive as much more lead as they can conveniently find room for.\r\nThe tour, indeed, has been a _wapenschouwing_, with oratory of the\r\nmost dangerous and pernicious type for its accompaniment. His\r\nHonour's contribution to this interesting display of martial ardour\r\nhas been couched, as usual, in the enigmatic form. He has spoken\r\nanother parable. A mind so fertile in image and in simile cannot have\r\nlost much of its wonted vigour. The one he has chosen to employ on\r\nthis occasion is full of instruction, and is derived, as Mr. Kruger's\r\nimages frequently are, from the arena of natural history. When you\r\nwant to kill your tortoise, he must be artfully induced to\r\nimprudently protrude his head beyond his thick and impregnable shell,\r\nand then the task becomes a very easy one. This little parable was\r\nconsidered good for use on more than one occasion, varied by the\r\naddition that, if the tortoise be up to the trick, it is necessary to\r\nsit down and wait until he does make the fatal mistake. The only\r\ndrawback to our profound intellectual delight in the parable is the\r\nquestion, 'Who will be the tortoise?'--_December 27, 1895._\r\n\r\nA perusal of the German White Book shows that\r\n\r\nOn December 24 the German Consul in Pretoria telegraphed to the\r\nForeign Office that 'news from Johannesburg points to the preparation\r\nof disturbances by the English party there, and the Government is\r\ntaking precautionary measures.' Baron von Marschall communicated this\r\nto Sir Frank Lascelles, and, after pointing out the possible\r\nconsequence of bloodshed, emphasized once again the necessity for\r\nmaintaining the _status quo_. In reply to the German Consul in\r\nPretoria, the Secretary of State telegraphed a similar statement,\r\nadding: 'Impress energetically upon the Transvaal Government that it\r\nmust most scrupulously avoid any provocation if it wishes to retain\r\nGerman sympathy.'\r\n\r\nAnother little light on the inside history is that afforded by Mr.\r\nJ.C. Bodenstein, Field-cornet of the Krugersdorp district, who in the\r\ncourse of an interview accorded to the _Standard and Diggers' News_,\r\nthe Johannesburg Government organ, stated how he came to know of\r\nJameson's intended invasion. He heard that a certain young lady who\r\nresided at Luipaardsvlei, near Krugersdorp, whose _fiancé_ occupied a\r\ngood position in the Bechuanaland Border Police, had received a\r\nletter from him at Mafeking to the effect that he intended paying her\r\na visit about the New Year, and that he would not be alone, as the\r\nwhole force was coming to Johannesburg. The lady proved no exception\r\nto the alleged rule concerning secrets, and Field-cornet Bodenstein\r\npersonally assured himself of the authenticity of the report he had\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, December 27, a German gentleman from the Free State also\r\ninformed the Field-cornet that Dr. Jameson and his troopers might be\r\nexpected at any time. 'On hearing this confirmation of the letter,'\r\nsaid Mr. Bodenstein, 'I went at once to Pretoria. I arrived there at\r\neleven o'clock at night, and early the next morning I saw the\r\nPresident and informed him about the letter and what I had been told.\r\nHe remarked quietly: \"Yes, I have heard all about it\" The General\r\n(Joubert) then said: \"All right; I will send you the ammunition you\r\nrequire.\"'\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Select Committee of the Cape House of Assembly\r\n(Blue Book A 6 of 1896, page 76) there is the evidence of the Hon.\r\nJ.A. Faure, M.L.C., which shows that he and Sir Thomas Upington, the\r\nAttorney-General of Cape Colony, were on a visit to Johannesburg on\r\nDecember 27, and heard it publicly stated that Dr. Jameson with 800\r\nmen was on the border for the purpose of invading the Transvaal.\r\nMr. Faure testifies that he learned this from a very prominent Free\r\nState Dutchman. Among others, one would suppose that the Transvaal\r\nGovernment must also have heard something of it.\r\n\r\nDr. Veale, a well-known Pretoria doctor, states that at daybreak on\r\nThursday, January 2, Commandant Hendrik Schoeman called on him to\r\nsecure his professional attendance for a member of his family who was\r\nvery ill. The Commandant said that he had been sent out on Monday to\r\nwatch the invading force and to ascertain their numbers, and also\r\nstated that he had been following the troop with others for a\r\nconsiderable time and that he was sure Jameson had not 800 but\r\nbetween 450 and 500, as he had repeatedly counted them; that the\r\nforce was being delayed by small parties drawing it into useless\r\nfighting and so losing time; that he himself had been obliged to come\r\non ahead, having been recalled on account of his wife's serious\r\nillness, but that it made little difference as there were others to\r\ntake his place, and they had arranged not to tackle Jameson until\r\nthey had drawn him among the kopjes at Doornkop, where it would be\r\nquite impossible for him ever to get through. This statement it\r\nshould be noted was made in Pretoria some hours before the Jameson\r\nforce surrendered at Doornkop.\r\n\r\nSo certain do the Boers appear to have been, and so confident of\r\ntheir ability to carry out their plans, that they stated to a\r\nreporter of the Government newspaper that they intended to stop\r\nJameson at Rietspruit (Doornkop), and this statement was published in\r\na Johannesburg paper on the morning of January 1, but was of course\r\nregarded as mere gossip of a piece with that which flooded the\r\nnewspapers at the time. It is only right to add that there were\r\nnumbers of other announcements at the same time which by no means\r\nagreed with this one, and it is stated that the editor was as much\r\nsurprised as the public to find that he had been right.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the whole of the circumstances of the raid, not the most\r\nbiased and most interested of persons can withhold a tribute of\r\nadmiration to the President's presence of mind, skill, and courage in\r\ndealing with circumstances wholly without precedent; and in quiet\r\nmoments, when recalling all that has happened, if human at all, his\r\nHonour must indulge in a chuckle now and then to think how completely\r\nhe jockeyed everybody.{32} Not the least amusing recollection must be\r\nthat of the 'great trek' (Banjailand Trek), which his burghers\r\nthreatened to make into Mashonaland viâ Rhodes' Drift when Sir John\r\nWilloughby gained his first experience of Oom Paul. The military\r\ncommander of Dr. Jameson's force had called on the President to add\r\nweight to the remonstrances which were being made against the action\r\nof the burghers in invading the Chartered territory, and the\r\nPresident, playing his cards for a favourable settlement of\r\nSwaziland, had replied that he had done all that he could, and events\r\nmust take their course. 'Tell him,' said Sir John to Dr. Leyds who\r\nwas interpreting, 'that if the trek is not stopped of course the\r\nresult will be war!' 'If it must be, let it be,' the old gentleman\r\nanswered quietly. 'Then tell him,' Sir John replied, 'that in that\r\ncase he will have to reckon with the British Army.' 'And tell _him_',\r\nsaid the President, pointing placidly at his interviewer with his big\r\npipe, 'that I have reckoned with the British Army once before.' If\r\nthe recollection occurred to both men on January 2, it must have been\r\nwith different emotions.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with President Kruger's personal attitude it is not\r\nperhaps pertinent but, it is interesting, to recall an incident of\r\nhis earlier career--a parallel between the prisoner and the\r\nPresident. Oddly enough President Kruger was a rebel and a filibuster\r\nhimself in the days of his hot youth, and one of his earliest\r\ndiplomatic successes was in securing the release and pardon of\r\nmen who, in 1857, stood in exactly the same position as the\r\nUitlanders whom he imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Potchefstroom revolt is little known in England, but\r\nit is told in Theal's 'Standard History of South Africa,' and very\r\ninstructive reading it is. Dr. Hillier, of Johannesburg, one of the\r\nReformers, called attention just before the outbreak to the\r\nextraordinary parallel between the revolt of Potchefstroom in 1857\r\nagainst the dominance of Lydenburg and the condition of Johannesburg\r\nin 1895 under the despotism of Pretoria. Dr. Hillier in his pamphlet\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Republic north of the Vaal attained its twentieth year.\r\nIt had increased in population, and had taken on, to some extent, the\r\nhabits and mode of life of a settled community. Mr. Pretorius and his\r\nfollowers began to feel that in the altered circumstances of the\r\nState the time had arrived for a remodelling of the Constitution.\r\nAmong these followers of Pretorius, these advocates of reform, it is\r\ninteresting to find was Mr. Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger.\r\n\r\nMr. Theal says:\r\n\r\n'During the months of September and October, 1856, Commandant-General\r\nM. W. Pretorius made a tour through the districts of Rutsenburg,\r\nPretoria and Potchefstroom, and called public meetings at all the\r\ncentres of population. At these meetings there was an expression by a\r\nlarge majority in favour of immediate adoption of a Constitution\r\nwhich should provide for an efficient Government and an independent\r\nChurch.'\r\n\r\nAnd again, later on, we have in the words of South Africa's historian\r\nthe gist of the complaint against the then existing state of things:\r\n\r\n'The community of Lydenburg was accused of attempting to domineer\r\nover the whole country, without any other right to preeminence than\r\nthat of being composed of the earliest inhabitants, a right which it\r\nhad forfeited by its opposition to the general weal.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the shocking state of things in this country in 1856. It was\r\na great deal too bad for such champion reformers as Mr. Pretorius and\r\nhis lieutenant, Mr. S.J.P. Kruger, as we shall see later. Shortly\r\nafter these meetings were held, a Representative Assembly, consisting\r\nof twenty-four members, one for each field-cornetcy, was elected for\r\nthe special purpose of framing a Constitution and installing the\r\nofficials whom it should decide to appoint.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1857, the Representative Assembly appointed Mr.\r\nMartinus Wessels Pretorius President, and also appointed members of\r\nan Executive Council. The oaths of office were then taken, the\r\nPresident and Executive installed, and the flag hoisted. When\r\nintelligence of these proceedings reached Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg,\r\nthere was a violent outburst of indignation. At a public meeting at\r\nZoutpansberg the acts and resolutions of the Representative Assembly\r\nat Potchefstroom were almost unanimously repudiated, and a manifesto\r\ndisowning the new Constitution and everything connected with it was\r\ndrawn up. Mr. Pretorius then issued a proclamation, deposing\r\nCommandant-General Schoeman from all authority, declaring\r\nZoutpansberg in a state of blockade, and prohibiting traders from\r\nsupplying 'the rebels' with ammunition or anything else. This conduct\r\non the part of the new Government under Mr. Pretorius appears to me\r\ndistinctly adroit. Having taken upon themselves to remodel the entire\r\nConstitution of the country, they turn round on the adherents of the\r\nolder Government, whom, by-the-by, they had not thought it worth\r\nwhile to consult, and promptly call them 'rebels.' And so you have\r\nthis striking political phenomenon of a revolutionary party turning\r\non the adherents of the Government of the State, and denouncing them,\r\nforsooth, as 'rebels.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Republic of Lydenburg' then declared itself into a sovereign and\r\nindependent State. And thus two Republics, two Volksraads, two\r\nGovernments, were formed and existed simultaneously in the Transvaal.\r\nAnd all this without a shot being fired, each party finding\r\nsufficient relief to its feelings by calling the other party\r\n'rebels.' In order to strengthen its position, the party of Pretorius\r\nnow determined on a bold stroke. They sent emissaries to endeavour to\r\narrange for union with the Free State. The Free State Government\r\nrejected their overtures, but Pretorius was led to believe that so\r\nmany of the Free State burghers were anxious for this union that all\r\nthat was necessary for him to do, in order to effect it, was to march\r\nin with an armed force. He therefore placed himself at the head of a\r\ncommando, and crossed the Vaal, where he was joined by a certain\r\nnumber of Free State burghers.\r\n\r\nBut Pretorius, with whom was Paul Kruger, found, like Dr. Jameson,\r\nthat he had reckoned without his host. When intelligence of this\r\ninvasion reached Bloemfontein, President Boshoff issued a\r\nproclamation declaring martial law in force throughout the Free\r\nState, and calling out burghers for the defence of the country. It\r\nsoon appeared that the majority of the people were ready to support\r\nthe President, and from all quarters men repaired to Kroonstad. At\r\nthis stage the Free State President received an offer of assistance\r\nfrom General Schoeman, of Zoutpansberg, against Pretorius, in which\r\nobject he believed Lydenburg would also join.\r\n\r\nOn May 25 the two commandoes were drawn up facing each other on\r\nopposite banks of the Rhenoster River, and remained in that position\r\nfor three hours. Threatened from the north as well as the south\r\nPretorius felt his chance of success was small, and he therefore sent\r\nout Commandant Paul Kruger with a flag of truce to propose that a\r\npacific settlement should be made.\r\n\r\nHere indeed is a very close parallel, but the climax is still to\r\ncome. The treaty arrived at was practically an apology on the part of\r\nthe South African Republic. Many citizens of the Free State who had\r\njoined the northern forces moved over the Vaal after this event.\r\nThose who remained and those who had been previously arrested were\r\nbrought to trial for high treason. One man was sentenced to death,\r\nbut the sentence was mitigated subsequently to a fine; others were\r\nfined. These fines were again still further mitigated at the\r\nsolicitation of Messrs. Paul Kruger and Steyn, until it came to\r\nlittle more than a ten-pound note apiece.\r\n\r\nThere we have the story of President Kruger and his friends playing\r\nexactly the part Dr. Jameson and the Johannesburg Reformers tried to\r\ndo. As Potchefstroom rose under Mr. Kruger against the oligarchical\r\nrule of Lydenburg, so Johannesburg was to rise against Pretoria. The\r\nPotchefstroom Republic under Pretorius and Kruger made a raid _à la_\r\nJameson into the Orange Free State for political purposes, to\r\nencourage those who were believed to be anxious to effect a\r\nunion. And just as Jameson failed against the Government of Pretoria,\r\nso Pretorius failed against the Government of the Orange Free State.\r\nIn 1857 it was Paul Kruger not Dr. Jameson who hoisted the white\r\nflag. The Free Staters who had tried to help Kruger's raid were\r\narrested just as the Johannesburgers were; but although one of them\r\nwas condemned to death all of them were released, by the intervention\r\nof Mr. Kruger himself, on paying a slight fine.\r\n\r\nHistory has repeated itself indeed; but the offence of Dr. Jameson is\r\nsurely less than that of Mr. Kruger, if we are to pay heed to the\r\nrecords of the Free State Volksraad, wherein it is written that on a\r\ncertain day the President stated in open Raad that proof had been\r\nobtained of a proposed combined attack on the Free State by the\r\nTransvaal Boers, led by Pretorius and Kruger on the one side, and the\r\nBasutos under Moshesh on the other--a horrible and unnatural alliance\r\nwhich was not effected only because Moshesh could not trust his\r\nprofessed allies. The Raad thereupon publicly gave thanks to the\r\nAlmighty, Who had revealed and frustrated this 'hideous complot.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter VI\r\n\r\n{24} In the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons\r\nthe following questions and answers occur, Mr. Blake questioning and\r\nMajor Heany replying:\r\n\r\n'Having got the message you went off with it and you got in, as we\r\nsee by the evidence, as quickly as you could, and you just gave the\r\nmessage as accurately as you could to Dr. Jameson?--I read the\r\nmessage from my note-book absolutely accurately to Dr. Jameson.\r\n\r\n'And he did not lose much time in making up his mind?--No; he went\r\noutside his tent. He was in a bell-tent when I arrived and he went\r\noutside and walked up and down for about twenty minutes, and then he\r\ncame in and announced his determination.'\r\n\r\n{25} In the course of the Inquiry at Westminster, Dr. Jameson\r\nhimself took occasion to explain this reference, when answering a\r\nquestion put by Mr. Sidney Buxton.\r\n\r\nKnowing what you do now of the position at Johannesburg, do you think\r\nit was within their power to send out 300 mounted men?--I cannot give\r\nan opinion upon that; I think all their actions were perfectly _bonâ\r\nfide_. There is one telegram here which has been brought up against\r\nme very unpleasantly, which I wish I had never sent, where 'fear' is\r\nimputed in the telegram as it stands here. My explanation is that I\r\nwas irritated at the time at the trouble going on, and that I used it\r\ninadvertently, or possibly there is a mistake in deciphering the code\r\nword; as to that I cannot tell, but I am sorry that it should appear\r\nso in the telegram, because I never imputed fear or cowardice to\r\nanyone in connection with anything.\r\n\r\n{26} July 1899. The originals have since been photographed and\r\nare here reproduced.\r\n\r\n{27} Colonel Francis Rhodes.\r\n\r\n{28} Lionel Phillips.\r\n\r\n{29} (July, 1899.) Is it not probable that the deleted figures\r\n'2,000' in Colonel Rhodes' letter (see photograph) may account\r\nfor some of the talk about 2,000 armed men?\r\n\r\n{30} After the arrival in England of the officers of Dr. Jameson's\r\nforce, a report dealing with the military aspect of the expedition\r\nwas sent by Sir John Willoughby to the War Office. It has been\r\nprinted and--to a certain extent--circulated, and cannot therefore\r\nbe regarded as private. But apart from this it is a document so\r\npeculiar--so marked by mishandling of notorious facts--that it\r\ndeserves no consideration other than it may earn on merits. It is\r\nprinted _in extenso_ with notes by a member of the Reform Committee.\r\nSee Appendix H.\r\n\r\n{31} See Appendix G. It will be noted that in his declarations\r\nCommandant Cronjé modifies his terms very considerably. It was\r\nimpossible for any reasonable person to accept the explanation\r\npreferred by him, that the promise to spare the lives of the\r\nsurrendered force was only to hold good until they could be handed\r\nover to the Commandant-General. In fact, it is well known that\r\nCommandant Cronjé only took up this attitude after an extremely\r\nacrimonious discussion had taken place between him and Commandant\r\nMalan--a quarrel in which they went the length of making charges\r\nagainst each other in the public press of treachery and neglect of\r\nduty whilst in the field. The Commandant Cronjé referred to here is\r\nthe same gentleman who commanded the Boer forces at Potchefstroom in\r\nthe War of Independence, and his record is an extremely unpleasant\r\none, his conduct of operations having earned for the Potchefstroom\r\ncommando the worst reputation of any. Apart from the execution\r\nof several British subjects who were suspected and, on wholly\r\ninsufficient grounds, summarily shot as spies, there are the\r\nunpleasant facts that he caused prisoners of war to be placed in the\r\nforefront of the besieging operations and compelled them to work in\r\nthe trenches in exposed positions so that they should be--and\r\nactually were--shot by their own comrades. There was also the\r\nincident in which he refused to allow one or two of the ladies who\r\nwere among the beleaguered garrison, and who were then in extremely\r\nbad health, to leave the fort to obtain such food and medical\r\nattendance as would enable them to live. One of the ladies died in\r\nconsequence. But the incident which has more bearing on Jameson's\r\nsurrender than any other is that connected with the armistice, when\r\nCommandant Cronjé, in defiance of treaty obligations, withheld from\r\nColonel Winslow and the besieged garrison the news that an armistice\r\nhad been arranged between the Boer and British forces, and continued\r\nthe siege until the garrison, in order to save the lives of the\r\nwounded and the women and children refugees, were obliged to\r\nsurrender. It will be remembered that this incident was too much even\r\nfor Mr. Gladstone, and that on its becoming known after the terms of\r\npeace had been settled, the Transvaal Government were required by Sir\r\nEvelyn Wood to allow a British force to march up from Natal and\r\nre-occupy Potchefstroom as a formal acknowledgment of Cronjé's\r\ntreachery. Mr. Kruger and his party, who were in the greatest fear\r\nthat the settlement would not be effected, and that Sir Evelyn Wood's\r\naction might provoke a renewal of hostilities, agreed to the terms,\r\nbut with grave apprehensions as to the results. However, no\r\n_contretemps_ occurred.\r\n\r\n{32} Once when out hunting on foot--a young man then--Mr. Kruger,\r\nafter climbing to the top of a kopje, found that he had been seen by\r\na number of hostile natives who were then running towards him, some\r\nto climb the hill, others branching out to surround it. He knew that\r\nthose on the flat could cut him off before he could descend and that\r\nhis only chance lay in 'bluff.' Stepping on to the outermost ledge in\r\nfull view of the enemy he calmly laid down his rifle, drew off first\r\none and then the other of his velschoens (home-made hide shoes, in\r\nthose poorer days worn without socks) and after quietly knocking the\r\nsand out of them drew them on again. By this time the natives had\r\nstopped to observe him. He then picked up his rifle again, and\r\nturning to an imaginary force behind the kopje waved to the right and\r\nthen to the left, as though directing them to charge round each end\r\nof the hill. The next instant the Kaffirs were in full retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAFTER DOORNKOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of Dr. Jameson's surrender was received in Johannesburg\r\ntowards mid-day, at first with derision, but as report after report\r\ncame in, each confirming and supplementing the other, no room for\r\ndoubt was left and a scene of the wildest excitement ensued. It is\r\nnot too much to say that not one person in a hundred, no matter what\r\nhis political leanings were, had doubted for a moment Dr. Jameson's\r\nability to force his way into Johannesburg. There is not the\r\nslightest indication in the newspapers of the time, which without\r\ndoubt reflected every varying mood and repeated every rumour which it\r\nwas possible to catch from an excited people, that there was in any\r\nman's mind a suspicion that the Boers would be able to stop the\r\ninvader. In the first place no one believed that they could mobilize\r\nsufficiently quickly to oppose him, and in the second place, he was\r\nunderstood to have a force of 800 men so admirably equipped and\r\ntrained that it would not be possible for 5,000 Boers hurriedly\r\ncalled together to intercept him. All this, however, was forgotten\r\nwhen it came to accounting for the disaster; or rather, the previous\r\nconvictions only added strength to the rage of disappointment. The\r\npublic by that time knew of the letter of invitation; it had been\r\ntaken on the battle-field and news of it was telegraphed in, and\r\napart from this the writers had made no secret of it. But what the\r\npublic did not know, and what, if they had known it, would not have\r\nappealed with similar force, was the efforts made to stop Jameson and\r\nthe practical withdrawal of the letter before he had started. It\r\nwas sufficient for them during the few remaining hours of that day to\r\nrecall that Jameson had come in, that he had fought against great\r\nodds, and that when almost reaching his goal he had been taken\r\nprisoner for want of assistance. It is perfectly true that in their\r\nrage of grief and disappointment men were willing to march out with\r\npick-handles to rescue him, if there were not rifles enough to arm\r\nthem. While the excitement lasted this was the mood, and the Reform\r\nCommittee were the scapegoats. The attitude of the crowd was due to\r\nignorance of the circumstances and natural emotion which could not be\r\notherwise vented. The excitement had greatly abated by the following\r\nmorning, and it was realized then that the position was practically\r\nbut little worse than that which the Reform Committee had offered\r\nto take up when they tendered their persons as security for the\r\nevacuation of the country by the invading force, and had proposed to\r\ncontinue the struggle without their aid.\r\n\r\nThe reports received by the Johannesburg people were to the effect\r\nthat the surrender had been conditional upon the sparing of the lives\r\nof the force. Indeed the first reports agreed that Jameson upon\r\nreceipt of the High Commissioner's proclamation, had laid down his\r\narms; but upon the return of Mr. Lace (whose mission has been\r\nexplained) it was realized that this was not the case. A later\r\naccount showed that Jameson had surrendered to Commandant Cronjé on\r\nthe condition that the lives of all should be spared, and this\r\nversion of the surrender was published in the Johannesburg\r\nnewspapers. When further accounts were received from Pretoria and\r\nKrugersdorp, stating that the surrender had been unconditional and\r\nthat there was grave doubt as to what would be done with Dr. Jameson,\r\nit was surmised as an explanation that he had declined to bargain for\r\nhis own life and had merely stipulated that those of his followers\r\nshould be spared.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the news that it was contemplated to shoot Dr. Jameson\r\ncaused a frenzy of horror and excitement in the town. Every effort\r\nwas made by the Reform Committee and its supporters to maintain\r\nstrictly the position which the Government had suggested through\r\ntheir Commission on Wednesday, lest some untoward incident should\r\nturn the trembling balance against Dr. Jameson and his men; nor were\r\nthe Committee alone in the desire to maintain that position. On\r\nFriday and on Saturday communications were received from the local\r\nGovernment officials, and from Commandant-General Joubert through the\r\nBritish Agent, drawing the attention of the Committee to alleged\r\nbreaches of the arrangement. The allegations were satisfactorily\r\ndisproved; but the communications clearly indicated that the\r\nGovernment were most desirous of maintaining the position in relation\r\nto Johannesburg which they had laid down before the first battle with\r\nDr. Jameson's forces.\r\n\r\nInformation was received on Thursday that the High Commissioner would\r\nleave Capetown for Pretoria at 9 p.m. that night. It had been a\r\nmatter of surprise that, the arrangement having been entered into\r\nwith him early on Wednesday, he had not found it convenient to start\r\nfor some thirty-six hours. Considering how seriously he had\r\ninterfered with the movement--first by his proclamation, and next by\r\nconcerted action with the Government for a peaceful settlement--it\r\nhad been naturally assumed that he would not lose a moment in leaving\r\nCapetown for the scene of trouble. Such however was not the case.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged that the arrangement made between the Transvaal\r\nGovernment and the High Commissioner with a view to a peaceful\r\nsettlement bore only upon Dr. Jameson's action, and that it was not\r\ncontemplated that there should be any interference between the\r\nGovernment and its own subjects in Johannesburg. In answer to this it\r\nmay be noted that the High Commissioner had in the first place\r\noffered his services, and that those services had been declined by\r\nthe Transvaal Government; but that the latter, on realizing the\r\nseriousness of the position which they were called upon to face, and\r\nacting, it is stated, upon the advice of Mr. J.H. Hofmeyr, the\r\nrecognized leader of the Dutch Africanders in the Cape Colony,\r\nreconsidered this refusal and urgently besought the High Commissioner\r\nto go up to Pretoria and use his influence to effect a peaceful\r\nsettlement. This arrangement, together with the promise of the\r\nredress of grievances, had been made known to the deputation of the\r\nReform Committee by the Government Commission in Pretoria, as has\r\nalready been stated--the Government well knowing that Johannesburg\r\nwas in arms and a party to the arrangement with Dr. Jameson.\r\n\r\nDr. Jameson surrendered at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday. The High\r\nCommissioner did not leave Capetown until 9 p.m. the same day. There\r\nhad therefore been ample time for the Government to intimate to him\r\ntheir opinion that matters had been satisfactorily settled and that\r\nthey did not need his services any longer, had they held such an\r\nopinion. As a matter of fact, that was by no means their opinion.\r\nThey considered that they had yet to deal with 20,000 armed men in\r\nJohannesburg, and that they had to do that, if possible, without\r\nprovoking a civil war, which would inevitably result in the long-run\r\nto their disadvantage, however great their success might be over the\r\nJohannesburg people in the meantime. They not only allowed the High\r\nCommissioner to proceed to Pretoria on the understanding originally\r\neffected, but they took steps to remind the Reform Committee on\r\nseveral occasions that they were expected to adhere to the\r\narrangement entered into. And such was the position when the High\r\nCommissioner arrived on the night of Saturday, the 4th.\r\n\r\nSir Hercules Robinson proceeded direct to Pretoria, but did not\r\ntransact any business until Monday, abstaining, in deference to the\r\nfeelings of the Boers, from any discussion of business matters on the\r\nSabbath. On Sunday, however, he received information from the Reform\r\nCommittee as to the arrangements entered into with the Government. He\r\nwas also informed that threats had been made by persons who without\r\ndoubt were speaking the mind of the Government, that if any trouble\r\nshould take place with Johannesburg Dr. Jameson and probably many of\r\nhis comrades would be shot. It was not stated that the Transvaal\r\nGovernment or authorities would officially countenance any such act\r\nor would authorize it even as the result of a trial; but the\r\nstatement which was made by everyone from the President downward was\r\nthat, in the event of any fighting in Johannesburg, the burghers\r\nwould be so much enraged and so beyond control that the prisoners who\r\nhad caused all the trouble would inevitably be shot. It is a part\r\nof Boer diplomacy to make as much use as possible of every weapon\r\nthat comes to hand without too great a regard for the decencies of\r\ngovernment as they occur to the minds of every civilized people, and\r\nit is not at all unusual to find the President proclaiming at one\r\nmoment that some course must be taken to prevent disaster, for the\r\nreason that he cannot be answerable for his burghers in their excited\r\nstate, and at another moment indignantly repudiating the suggestion\r\nthat they would be guilty of any step that could be considered\r\nunworthy of the most civilized of peoples. In fact such exhibitions\r\nwere repeatedly given by him at a later stage when dealing with the\r\nReform prisoners.\r\n\r\nBefore any communication was received from the High Commissioner on\r\nMonday messages had been received by the members of the Reform\r\nCommittee to the effect that the laying down of arms would be\r\nabsolutely necessary to ensure the safety of Jameson and his men. The\r\nReform Committee had then learnt that the two messengers sent to stop\r\nDr. Jameson--Major Heany and Captain Holden--had reached him, and had\r\ncome in with him, and were at that moment prisoners with him in\r\nPretoria. They had also heard of the reception accorded to Sir\r\nJacobus de Wet's despatch and the High Commissioner's proclamation,\r\nso that it was abundantly clear that the incursion had been made in\r\ndefiance of the wishes of the leaders, whatever other reasons there\r\nmight have been to prompt it. But the public who constituted the\r\nmovement were still under the impression that Dr. Jameson was a very\r\nfine fellow who had come in in a chivalrous manner to help those whom\r\nhe had believed to be in distress. There was however no division of\r\nopinion as to what should be done; even those who felt most sore\r\nabout the position in which they had been placed did not hesitate for\r\na moment. The first and for the time being the only consideration was\r\nthe safety of Dr. Jameson and his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe events and negotiations of the days preceding the arrest of the\r\nReformers have been the subject of so much discussion and so much\r\nmisunderstanding that it will be better as far as possible to compile\r\nthe history from original documents or the published and properly\r\nauthenticated copies. In Blue Book [C. 7,933] the following is\r\npublished:\r\n\r\nSIR HERCULES ROBINSON (Pretoria) to MR. CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n\r\n(_Telegraphic. Received 1.8 a.m., 6th January, 1896._)\r\n\r\n_5th January_. No. 3.--Arrived here last night. Position of affairs\r\nvery critical. On side of Government of South African Republic and of\r\nOrange Free State there is a desire to show moderation, but Boers\r\nshow tendency to get out of hand and to demand execution of Jameson.\r\nI am told that Government of South African Republic will demand\r\ndisarmament of Johannesburg as a condition precedent to negotiations.\r\nTheir military preparations are now practically complete, and\r\nJohannesburg, if besieged, could not hold out, as they are short of\r\nwater and coal. On side of Johannesburg leaders desire to be\r\nmoderate, but men make safety of Jameson and concession of items in\r\nmanifesto issued conditions precedent to disarmament. If these are\r\nrefused, they assert they will elect their own leaders and fight it\r\nout in their own way. As the matter now stands, I see great\r\ndifficulty in avoiding civil war; but I will do my best, and\r\ntelegraph result of my official interview to-morrow. It is said that\r\nPresident of South African Republic intends to make some demands with\r\nrespect to Article No. 4 of the London Convention of 1884.\r\n\r\nMR. CHAMBERLAIN to SIR HERCULES ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n(_Telegraphic. January 6, 1896._)\r\n\r\n_6th January_. No. 3.--It is reported in the press telegrams the\r\nPresident of the South African Republic on December 30 held out\r\ndefinite hopes that concessions would be proposed in regard to\r\neducation and the franchise. No overt act of hostility appears to\r\nhave been committed by the Johannesburg people since the overthrow of\r\nJameson. The statement that arms and ammunition are stored in that\r\ntown in large quantities may be only one of many boasts without\r\nfoundation. Under these circumstances, active measures against the\r\ntown do not seem to be urgently required at the present moment, and I\r\nhope no step will be taken by the President of the South African\r\nRepublic liable to cause more bloodshed and excite civil war in the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThese are followed in the same volume by No. 89:\r\n\r\nSIR HERCULES ROBINSON (Pretoria) to MR. CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n\r\n(_Telegraphic. Received 7th January, 1896._)\r\n\r\n_6th January_. No. 2.--Met President South African Republic and\r\nExecutive Council to-day. Before opening proceedings, I expressed on\r\nbehalf of Her Majesty's Government my sincere regret at the\r\nunwarrantable raid made by Jameson; also thanked Government of South\r\nAfrican Republic for the moderation shown under trying circumstances.\r\nWith regard to Johannesburg, President of South African Republic\r\nannounced decision of Government to be that Johannesburg must lay\r\ndown its arms unconditionally as a precedent to any discussion and\r\nconsideration of grievances. I endeavoured to obtain some indication\r\nof the steps that would be taken in the event of disarmament, but\r\nwithout success, it being intimated that Government of South African\r\nRepublic had nothing more to say on this subject than had been\r\nalready embodied in proclamation of President of South African\r\nRepublic. I inquired as to whether any decision had been come to as\r\nregards disposal of prisoners, and received a reply in the negative.\r\nPresident of South African Republic said that, as his burghers, to\r\nnumber of 8,000, had been collected, and could not be asked to remain\r\nindefinitely, he must request a reply, 'Yes' or 'No,' to this\r\nultimatum within twenty-four hours. I have communicated decision of\r\nSouth African Republic to Reform Committee at Johannesburg through\r\nBritish Agent in South African Republic.\r\n\r\nThe burgher levies are in such an excited state over the invasion of\r\ntheir country that I believe President of South African Republic\r\ncould not control them except in the event of unconditional\r\nsurrender. I have privately recommended them to accept ultimatum.\r\nProclamation of President of South African Republic refers to promise\r\nto consider all grievances which are properly submitted, and to lay\r\nthe same before the Legislature without delay.\r\n\r\nOn January 7 Mr. Chamberlain replied:\r\n\r\nNo. 1.--I approve of your advice to Johannesburg. Kruger will be wise\r\nnot to proceed to extremities at Johannesburg or elsewhere; otherwise\r\nthe evil animosities already aroused may be dangerously excited.\r\n\r\nAnd on the same day Sir Hercules Robinson telegraphed:\r\n\r\nNo. 1.--Your telegram of January 6, No. 2. It would be most\r\ninexpedient to send troops to Mafeking at this moment, and there is\r\nnot the slightest necessity for such a step, as there is no danger\r\nfrom Kimberley volunteer corps or from Mafeking. I have sent De Wet\r\nwith ultimatum this morning to Johannesburg, and believe arms will be\r\nlaid down unconditionally. I understand in such case Jameson and all\r\nprisoners will be handed over to me. Prospect now very hopeful if no\r\ninjudicious steps are taken. Please leave matter in my hands.\r\n\r\nOn Monday Sir Jacobus de Wet, acting under the instructions of the\r\nHigh Commissioner, telegraphed from Pretoria to the Reform Committee,\r\nJohannesburg, informing them that the High Commissioner had seen the\r\nPresident and Executive that morning, that he had been informed that\r\nas a condition precedent to the discussion and consideration of\r\ngrievances the Government required that the Johannesburg people\r\nshould lay down their arms; and that the Government gave them\r\ntwenty-four hours--from 4 p.m. that day--in which to accept or reject\r\nthat ultimatum. The Committee replied that it would receive their\r\nearnest consideration.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that such a condition had been anticipated\r\nthe ultimatum was very unfavourably received, a large number of those\r\npresent protesting that the Uitlanders were being led little by\r\nlittle into a trap, that the Boers as was their wont would never keep\r\nfaith with them, that in the end they would find themselves\r\nbetrayed, and that it would be better at no matter what cost to make\r\na fight for it and attempt to rescue Dr. Jameson and his party. The\r\nlast suggestion was a mad one, and after some consideration, and\r\nhearing the representations of Sir Sidney Shippard and Mr. Seymour\r\nFort, who had been in communication with the High Commissioner on the\r\nprevious day in Pretoria and were used by him as unofficial agents,\r\nthe matter was more calmly considered by the Committee. It was very\r\nwell realized that a struggle between Johannesburg and the Boer\r\nforces would have been an absolutely hopeless one for those who took\r\npart in it, but there was a determination to secure the objects for\r\nthe attainment of which the agitation had been started, and it was\r\nbelieved that if a firm stand were taken, such was the justice of the\r\ncause of the Uitlanders that the Government would not be able to\r\nrefuse definite terms as to what reforms they would introduce,\r\nbesides assuring the safety of Dr. Jameson.\r\n\r\nWhile the discussion was proceeding another telegram was received\r\nfrom the British Agent saying that, under instructions from the High\r\nCommissioner, he was proceeding in person to Johannesburg to meet the\r\nReform Committee and explain matters to them. The meeting took place\r\non the morning of Tuesday, and Sir Jacobus de Wet pointed out to the\r\nCommittee the perilous position in which Dr. Jameson and his comrades\r\nwere placed, owing to the hesitation of the Uitlanders to accept the\r\nultimatum of the Government. He read again and again the following\r\ntelegram from the High Commissioner, which had been despatched from\r\nPretoria early that morning and received by the British Agent in\r\nJohannesburg when on his way to meet the Reform Committee:\r\n\r\n_Urgent_.--You should inform the Johannesburg people that I consider\r\nthat if they lay down their arms they will be acting loyally and\r\nhonourably, and that if they do not comply with my request they\r\nforfeit all claim to sympathy from Her Majesty's Government and from\r\nBritish subjects throughout the world, as the lives of Jameson and\r\nthe prisoners are now practically in their hands.\r\n\r\nIn reply to remarks about grievances, Sir Jacobus de Wet stated that\r\nthe Uitlanders could not expect under the circumstances anything\r\nmore favourable than the discussion and consideration of the\r\ngrievances with the High Commissioner, as had been promised, and\r\nadded that, if there were any spirit of reason in the community at\r\nall, they would be content to leave their case in the hands of so\r\nexperienced a statesman as Sir Hercules Robinson, a man whose\r\ninstinct and training were towards fair and decent government.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a very long discussion, Sir Jacobus de Wet was asked\r\nif he did not consider the Boer Government capable of an act of\r\ntreachery such as disarming the community and then proceeding to\r\nwreak their vengeance upon those whom they might consider responsible\r\nfor the agitation. According to the evidence of a number of those who\r\nwere present, his reply was that 'not a hair of the head of any man\r\nin Johannesburg would be touched.' The discussion was resumed at\r\nvarious times and in various forms, when different groups of men had\r\nopportunities of questioning the British Agent themselves. When\r\nquestioned again more definitely as to whether this immunity would be\r\nextended to the leaders--those who had signed the letter--Sir Jacobus\r\nde Wet replied again in the affirmative. To another member, who had\r\nasked the same question in another form, he said 'Not one among you\r\nwill lose his personal liberty for a single hour. John Bull would\r\nnever allow it.' In reply to the remark, 'John Bull has had to put up\r\nwith a good deal in this country. What do you mean by \"John Bull\"?'\r\nhe answered, 'I mean the British Government could not possibly allow\r\nsuch a thing.'\r\n\r\nIt would have been an easy and no doubt a proper and reasonable\r\nprecaution had the Reformers insisted upon a statement in writing of\r\nthe terms upon which they laid down their arms. There were however\r\ntwo considerations which weighed against any bargain of this sort.\r\nThe first was the overwhelming and paramount consideration of\r\ninsuring Dr. Jameson's safety; and the other was the belief (not\r\nseriously shaken by suggestions to the contrary) that the Government\r\nwould be obliged to abide by the spirit of the terms arranged on\r\nJanuary 1, because the High Commissioner would insist upon it as the\r\nvital condition under which he was endeavouring to effect the\r\ndisarmament of Johannesburg. That Sir Hercules Robinson well\r\nrealized his responsibility to the Uitlander, but found it\r\ninconvenient or impossible to accept it at a later stage, is shown by\r\nhis own reports. On January 7 he telegraphed to Mr. Chamberlain as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Your telegram No. 3 of January 6. I need now only say that I have\r\njust received a message from Reform Committee resolving to comply\r\nwith demand of South African Republic to lay down their arms; the\r\npeople placing themselves (? and) their interests unreservedly in my\r\nhands in the fullest confidence that I will see justice done to them.\r\nI have received also the following from British agent, dated 7th\r\nJanuary:_\r\n\r\n_Begins:_ I have sent the following telegram to His Honour the\r\nPresident:\r\n\r\nI have met the Reform Committee. Am gratified with the spirit shown\r\nin the discussion of the all-important present position. The\r\nCommittee handed me the following resolution--_Begins:_ The Reform\r\nCommittee in Johannesburg, having seriously considered the ultimatum\r\nof the Government of the South African Republic communicated to them\r\nthrough Her Majesty's Agent at Pretoria, in a telegram dated 6th\r\ninstant, to the effect that Johannesburg must lay down its arms as a\r\ncondition precedent to a discussion and consideration of grievances,\r\nhave unanimously decided to comply with this demand, and have given\r\ninstructions to the citizens employed by this Committee for\r\nmaintaining good order to lay down their arms. In coming to this\r\ndetermination, the Committee rely upon the Government that it will\r\nmaintain law and order, and protect life and property in this town at\r\nthis critical juncture. The Committee have been actuated by a\r\nparamount desire to do everything possible to ensure the safety of\r\nDr. Jameson and his men, _to advance the amicable discussion of terms\r\nof settlement with the Government, and to support the High\r\nCommissioner in his efforts in this respect_. The Committee would\r\ndraw the attention of the Government of the Republic to the presence\r\nof armed burgher forces in the immediate vicinity of this town, and\r\nwould earnestly desire that these forces be removed in order to avoid\r\nall risk of any disturbance of the public peace. _Resolution ends_. I\r\nwish to add to my above remarks that I feel convinced there will be\r\nno further difficulty in connection with the laying down of their\r\narms. I would suggest that the Government co-operate with the Reform\r\nCommittee for a day or two for the purpose of restoring the town to\r\nits normal state. This will only take a day or two, and those who are\r\nexcited among the people will by that time have calmed down, and the\r\npolice can resume their ordinary duties. The Committee will\r\nco-operate in this matter. This course will very much facilitate the\r\ntask of your Government if it meets with your approval. _Ends_.\r\n\r\nThe High Commissioner concluded the above telegram with the following\r\nsignificant sentence:\r\n\r\n_I hope now to be able to confer with President of the South African\r\nRepublic and Executive Council as to prisoners and the redress of\r\nJohannesburg grievances_.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th he again telegraphed:\r\n\r\nReferring to your telegram of the 7th inst., No. 1, I consider that\r\nso far throughout this matter Kruger has behaved very well. He\r\nsuspended hostilities pending my arrival, when Johannesburg was at\r\nhis mercy; and in opposition to a very general feeling of the\r\nExecutive Council and of the burghers who have been clamouring for\r\nJameson's life, he has now determined to hand over Jameson and the\r\nother prisoners. If Jameson had been tried here there can be no doubt\r\nthat he would have been shot, and perhaps some of his colleagues\r\nalso. The excitement of the public is now calmed down.\r\n\r\nI shall try to-day to make arrangements with Kruger as to taking over\r\nthe prisoners, and _I will confer with him as to redressing the\r\ngrievances of the residents of Johannesburg on the basis of your\r\ntelegram of the 4th inst. I have given Kruger a copy of that\r\ntelegram._'\r\n\r\nAnd later on the same day:\r\n\r\nSince my telegram No. 1 of this morning, matters have not been going\r\nso smoothly. When the Executive Council met, I received a message\r\nthat only 1,814 rifles and three Maxim guns had been surrendered,\r\nwhich the Government of the South African Republic did not consider a\r\nfulfilment of the ultimatum, and orders would be immediately issued\r\nto a commando to attack Johannesburg. I at once replied that the\r\nultimatum required the surrender of guns and ammunition for which no\r\npermit of importation had been obtained, and that onus rested with\r\nTransvaal Government to show that guns and ammunition were concealed\r\nfor which no permit had been issued. If before this was done any\r\nhostile step were taken against Johannesburg, I should consider it to\r\nbe a violation of the undertaking for which I had made myself\r\npersonally responsible to the people of Johannesburg, and I should\r\nleave the issue in hands of Her Majesty's Government. This had a\r\nsobering effect, and the order for the attack on Johannesburg was\r\ncountermanded, and it was arranged that the Transvaal officials\r\nshould accompany Her Majesty's Agent to Johannesburg and point out to\r\nhim if they could where arms were concealed. Her Majesty's Agent left\r\nat 1 p.m. to-day for Johannesburg for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the change, I take it, is that Kruger has great\r\ndifficulties to contend with among his own people. The apparent\r\nobject is to prove that people of Johannesburg have not fulfilled the\r\nconditions which were to precede the handing over of the prisoners\r\nand consideration of grievances. I should not be surprised if, before\r\nreleasing the prisoners or redressing grievances, an attempt were now\r\nmade to extort an alteration of the London Convention of 1884, and\r\nthe abrogation of Article No. 4 of that instrument. _I intend, if I\r\nfind that the Johannesburg people have substantially complied with\r\nthe ultimatum, to insist on the fulfilment of promises as regards\r\nprisoners and consideration of grievances_, and will not allow at\r\nthis stage the introduction of any fresh conditions as regards the\r\nLondon Convention of 1884. Do you approve?\r\n\r\nThe Reform Committee published the following official notice on\r\nTuesday afternoon:\r\n\r\nThe Reform Committee notify hereby that all rifles issued for the\r\ndefence of life and property in town and the mines are to be returned\r\nat once to the Central Office in order to enable the Committee to\r\ncarry out the agreement with the Government, upon the faithful\r\nobservance of which so much is dependent.\r\n\r\nThe Committee desire to make it known that late last night they\r\nreceived an intimation from Her Majesty's Agent in Pretoria to the\r\neffect that the decision of the Government was that Johannesburg must\r\nlay down its arms as a condition precedent to the discussion and\r\nconsideration of grievances.\r\n\r\nThe Committee met this morning to consider the position, and it was\r\nunanimously resolved to accept the ultimatum of the Government for\r\nreasons which the following communications sufficiently explain:\r\n\r\nHere followed the High Commissioner's telegram to Sir Jacobus de Wet,\r\nurging disarmament, already given, and the following memorandum:\r\n\r\nSir Jacobus de Wet, Her Majesty's Agent at Pretoria, has notified to\r\nthe Committee that he has been officially informed by the Government\r\nin Pretoria that upon Johannesburg laying down its arms Dr. Jameson\r\nwill be handed over to Her Majesty's High Commissioner.\r\n\r\n  By Order.\r\n\r\n  Johannesburg, _7th January._\r\n    The above is correct.\r\n     J.A. DE WET,\r\n          H.B.M. Agent.\r\n\r\nThe Committee can add nothing to the above, and feel that there will\r\nnot be one man among the thousands who have joined the Reform\r\nmovement who will not find it consistent with honour and humanity to\r\nco-operate loyally in the carrying out of the Committee's decision.\r\n\r\n  By order of the Committee.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the investigations effected by the Government, with the\r\naid of the Reform Committee, established the fact that the ultimatum\r\nhad been complied with; but the juggling with Dr. Jameson's life\r\ncontinued for some days. On Thursday the 9th the High Commissioner\r\nreceived a communication from the President in which occurred the\r\nfollowing sentence: 'As I had already caused your Excellency to be\r\ninformed, it is really my intention to act in this sense (_i.e._,\r\nhand over Dr. Jameson and men), so that Dr. Jameson and the British\r\nsubjects who were under his command may then be punished by her\r\nMajesty's Government, and I will make known to your Excellency the\r\nfinal decision in this matter _as soon as Johannesburg shall have\r\nreverted to a condition of quietness and order_.'\r\n\r\nIn the face of this and many other significant messages and\r\nexpressions which reached Sir Hercules Robinson, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that he considered Dr. Jameson's life to be in peril, and\r\nthat he regarded, as he distinctly said he did, disarmament by\r\nJohannesburg as the only means of saving him; but what is less\r\npardonable is, that he did not pin President Kruger to this, and\r\ndemand an explanation when it became known that Jameson and his men\r\nwere secured by the conditions of the surrender. The truth is that\r\nthe wily old Boer President, by a species of diplomacy which does not\r\nnow commend itself to civilized people, managed to jockey everybody\r\nwith whom he had any dealings. He is much in the position of a\r\ncertain financier who, after a vain effort to justify his\r\nproceedings, turned at last in desperation upon his critics and said:\r\n'Well, I don't care what view you hold of it. You can have the\r\nmorality, but I've got the cash.'\r\n\r\nLate in the evening of the 9th the following proclamation was\r\npublished:\r\n\r\nWhereas by resolution of the Government of the South African\r\nRepublic, dated Monday, the 6th of January, 1896, whereby to all\r\npersons at Johannesburg and suburbs twenty-four hours were granted to\r\nhand over and to lay down to the Government unconditionally all arms\r\nand ammunition for which no permit could be shown, and\r\n\r\nWhereas the said period of twenty-four hours has already expired on\r\nTuesday, the 7th of January, 1896, and whereas the so-called Reform\r\nCommittee and other British subjects have consented and decided to\r\ncomply unconditionally with the resolution of the Government, and\r\n\r\nWhereas sundry persons already have laid down their arms and\r\nammunition, and have handed them over to the Government, and\r\n\r\nWhereas the laying down and giving over of the said arms and\r\nammunition is still proceeding, and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is desirable and proper that this be done as soon as\r\npossible, and in a proper way, and that a term be fixed thereto,\r\n\r\nNow I, Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, State President of the South\r\nAfrican Republic, with the advice and consent of the Executive\r\nCouncil, by virtue of Article 5 of their minutes, dated 9th January,\r\n1896, proclaim that further time will be given for that purpose until\r\nFRIDAY, the 10th JANUARY, 1896, at 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nAll persons or corporations with whom, after the expiration of that\r\nperiod, arms or ammunition will be found, for which no permit granted\r\nby Government can be shown, will be dealt with according to law; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the laying down and handing over of the said arms and\r\nammunition should have been effected unconditionally,\r\n\r\nNow I further proclaim that all persons who have already laid down\r\nand given over the said arms and ammunition, or who shall have done\r\nso before Friday, the 10th January, 1896, at 6 p.m., shall be\r\nexempted from all prosecution, and will be forgiven for the misdeeds\r\nthat have taken place at Johannesburg and suburbs, _except all\r\npersons and corporations who will appear to be the chief\r\noffenders, ringleaders, leaders, instigators, and those who have\r\ncaused the rebellion at Johannesburg and suburbs_.\r\n\r\nSuch persons and corporations shall have to answer for their deeds\r\nbefore the legal and competent courts of this Republic.\r\n\r\nI further proclaim that I will address the inhabitants of\r\nJohannesburg to-morrow by a separate proclamation.\r\n\r\n_God save Land and People._\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at the Government Office at Pretoria on this\r\nNinth Day of January, in the Year One Thousand Eight Hundred and\r\nNinety-six.\r\n\r\n  S.J.P. KRUGER,\r\n     _State President_.\r\n  C. VAN BOESCHOTEN,\r\n     _Acting State Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThe grim, cautious method of the President was never better\r\nillustrated than by these proclamations and the concurrent actions.\r\nIn no part of his diplomatic career has he better stage-managed the\r\nbusiness than he did here. To the world at large these addresses\r\ncommend themselves no doubt as reasonable and moderate, and they\r\nestablish a record which will always speak for him when the\r\nchronology of events is lost; but the true worth of it all is only\r\nappreciated when one realizes that the first proclamation extending\r\nthe time for disarmament, and promising amnesty to all except the\r\nleaders, was not issued until two days after the Government had\r\nsatisfied themselves that the disarmament had been completed, and\r\nthat it was deliberately held back until the police and burghers were\r\nin the outskirts of the town ready to pounce upon the men with whom\r\nthey had been treating. It is an absolute fact that the Reform\r\nCommittee-men, who had offered to effect the peaceful settlement\r\nseemingly desired by all parties, who had used every means in their\r\npower to convince the Government that disarming was being effected in\r\na _bonâ fide_ and complete manner, and who had themselves supplied\r\nthe Government in good faith with any documents they had showing the\r\nnumber of guns and the amount of ammunition which had been at the\r\ndisposal of the Reform Committee, had not the remotest suspicion that\r\nan act of treachery was in contemplation, nor any hint that the\r\nGovernment did not regard them as amnestied by virtue of the\r\nnegotiations; and it is a fact that when the proclamation of the 9th\r\nwas issued the detectives were waiting at the clubs, hotels and\r\nhouses to arrest the members of the Reform Committee, and that\r\nthe Reformers did not know of the proclamation exempting them from\r\nthe 'Forgive and Forget' until after they had been seized.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th the address promised to the inhabitants of Johannesburg\r\nduly appeared.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing recent events, it concluded with this appeal:\r\n\r\nNow I address you with full confidence! Strengthen the hands of the\r\nGovernment, and work together with them to make this Republic a\r\ncountry where all inhabitants, so to say, live fraternally together.\r\nFor months and months I have thought which alterations and\r\nemendations would be desirable in the Government of this State, but\r\nthe unwarrantable instigations, especially of the Press, have kept me\r\nback. The same men who now appear in public as the leaders have\r\ndemanded amendments from me in a time and manner which they should\r\nnot have dared to use in their own country out of fear of the penal\r\nlaw. Through this it was made impossible for me and my burghers, the\r\nfounders of this Republic, to take your proposals into consideration.\r\nIt is my intention to submit a draft law at the first ordinary\r\nsession of the Volksraad, whereby a municipality with a Mayor at its\r\nhead will be appointed for Johannesburg, to whom the whole municipal\r\ngovernment of this town will be entrusted. According to all\r\nconstitutional principles, such a municipal council should be\r\nappointed by the election of the inhabitants. I ask you earnestly,\r\nwith your hand upon your heart, to answer me this question: Dare I,\r\nand should I, after all that has happened, propose such to the\r\nVolksraad? What I myself answer to this question is, I know that\r\nthere are thousands in Johannesburg to whom I can with confidence\r\nentrust this right to vote in municipal matters. Inhabitants of\r\nJohannesburg, make it possible for the Government to appear before\r\nthe Volksraad with the motto, 'Forget and Forgive.'\r\n\r\n  (Signed)   S.J.P. KRUGER,\r\n        _State President_.\r\n\r\nOne would think that anyone gifted with even a moderate sense of\r\nhumour would have been restrained by it from issuing a second\r\nproclamation on top of the elaborate fooling of the first. Is it\r\npossible to imagine any other community or any other Government in\r\nthe world in which the ruler could seriously set to work to\r\npromulgate two such proclamations, sandwiching as they did those acts\r\nwhich may be regarded as the practical expression--diametrically\r\nopposed to the published expression--of his intentions?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the negotiations concerning Dr. Jameson were dragging\r\non. After securing the disarmament of Johannesburg and getting rid of\r\nthe troublesome question of the disposal of Jameson, and after\r\nrefusing for several days (to quote the gist of the High\r\nCommissioner's telegram, Blue Book No. 125 [C-7933]) to allow the\r\nnecessary arrangements for the deportation of the men to be made, Mr.\r\nKruger suddenly called upon the High Commissioner to have them\r\nremoved at once, intimating at the same time that it was the decision\r\nof the Executive that all the prisoners, except the Transvaal and\r\nFree State subjects, whom he would retain, should be sent to England\r\nto be tried according to English law. It was pointed out that it was\r\nonly contemplated to send the officers for trial. To this Mr. Kruger\r\nreplied: 'In such case the whole question must be reconsidered.'\r\nThe High Commissioner at once telegraphed for the decision of Her\r\nMajesty's Government, stating that it was the opinion of Sir Jacobus\r\nde Wet and Sir Graham Bower, who had represented him at the interview\r\nwith the Transvaal Government, that, if the whole lot were not sent\r\nhome to be dealt with according to English law, they would be tried\r\nin Pretoria, with a result which he feared would be deplorable. To\r\nthis Mr. Chamberlain replied:\r\n\r\nAstonished that Council should hesitate to fulfil the engagement\r\nwhich we understood was made by President with you, and confirmed by\r\nthe Queen, on the faith of which you secured disarmament of\r\nJohannesburg. Any delay will produce worst impression here, and may\r\nlead to serious consequences. I have already promised that all the\r\nleaders shall be brought to trial immediately; but it would be absurd\r\nto try the rank and file, who only obeyed orders which they could not\r\nrefuse. If desired we may however engage to bring to England all who\r\nare not domiciled in South Africa; but we cannot undertake to bring\r\nall the rank and file to trial, for that would make a farce of the\r\nwhole proceedings, and is contrary to the practice of all civilized\r\nGovernments. As regards a pledge that they shall be punished, the\r\nPresident will see on consideration that although a Government can\r\norder a prosecution, it cannot in any free country compel a\r\nconviction. You may remind him that the murderers of Major Elliott,\r\nwho were tried in the Transvaal in 1881, were acquitted by a jury of\r\nburghers. Compare also the treatment by us of Stellaland and other\r\nfreebooters.\r\n\r\nThe result of this communication was that the President drew in his\r\nhorns and agreed that if the prisoners were deported to England he\r\nwould be satisfied to let the British Government decide which of them\r\nshould be prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThe success of his diplomatic methods had whetted his appetite, it\r\nwould appear. He was not content with the conditional surrender of\r\nDr. Jameson, nor--having suppressed the fact that it was\r\nconditional--with having used him for the purpose of disarming\r\nJohannesburg; but, having achieved both purposes, Mr. Kruger was\r\nstill desirous of keeping him in hand. This however was a length to\r\nwhich the British Government did not see fit to go; but there is no\r\nevidence in the correspondence which has passed tending to show that\r\neven then Sir Hercules Robinson perceived how he was being made use\r\nof and played with by the President.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, the members of\r\nthe Reform Committee to the number of about sixty were arrested and\r\nlodged in gaol; and from this moment the High Commissioner appears to\r\nhave erased them from the tablets of his memory. On January 14 he\r\ntelegraphed to Mr. Chamberlain as follows:\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from Government of South African Republic,\r\nstating that, in their opinion, every reason exists for assuming that\r\nthe complications at Johannesburg are approaching to an end, and that\r\nthere need be no longer any fear of further bloodshed. The President\r\nof the South African Republic and Executive Council tender to me the\r\nwarmest thanks of the Government of the South African Republic for\r\nthe assistance I have been able to render in preventing further\r\nbloodshed, and their congratulations on the manner in which my object\r\nin coming has been fulfilled. They tender also their cordial\r\nacknowledgment of the services rendered by the British Agent at\r\nPretoria, which I think is fully deserved. The Volksraad met\r\nyesterday, and adjourned until May, the only business transacted\r\nbeing a vote of thanks to the Orange Free State and the High\r\nCommissioner for their efforts in promoting a peaceful settlement,\r\nwhich was carried by acclamation. I now only await settlement of\r\nprisoners' difficulty to leave for Capetown, where my presence is\r\nurgently needed in consequence of change of Ministers. Governor of\r\nNatal and General Cox are here, to whom I will give instructions as\r\nto reception and disposal of prisoners as soon as I hear from you.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed a most important reply on January\r\n15:\r\n\r\nI am left in great perplexity by your telegram No. 3, of the 14th\r\ninst., and fear that some previous telegrams must have miscarried.\r\n(Here follow directions to refer to a number of telegrams in which\r\nMr. Chamberlain had indicated the settlement which he anticipated,\r\nthe nature of the reforms which Sir Hercules Robinson was to secure,\r\nand many inquiries as to the reason for the arrests of the reformers\r\nas reported in the English papers.) I have received no reply to any\r\nof these telegrams, but have assumed that negotiations were in\r\nprogress between the President and yourself.\r\n\r\nThere can be no settlement until the questions raised by these\r\ntelegrams are disposed of. The people of Johannesburg laid down their\r\narms in the belief that reasonable concessions would be arranged by\r\nyour intervention; and until these are granted, or are definitely\r\npromised to you by the President, the root-causes of the recent\r\ntroubles will remain.\r\n\r\nThe President has again and again promised reform, and especially on\r\nthe 30th December last, when he promised reforms in education and\r\nfranchise; and grave dissatisfaction would be excited if you left\r\nPretoria without a clear understanding on these points. Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment invite President Kruger, in the interests of the South\r\nAfrican Republic and of peace, to make a full declaration on these\r\nmatters. I am also awaiting a reply respecting the alleged wholesale\r\narrests of English, Americans and other nationalities, made after the\r\nsurrender of Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nIt will be your duty to use firm language, and to tell the President\r\nthat neglect to meet the admitted grievances of the Uitlanders by\r\ngiving a definite promise to propose reasonable concessions would\r\nhave a disastrous effect upon the prospects of a lasting and\r\nsatisfactory settlement.\r\n\r\nSend me a full report of the steps that you have already taken with\r\nregard to this matter, and of the further action that you propose.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sir Hercules Robinson left Pretoria, satisfied that\r\nhe had done all that was necessary, and telegraphed to Mr.\r\nChamberlain as follows:\r\n\r\nFROM THE HIGH COMMISSIONER _en route_ TO CAPETOWN.\r\n\r\n_15th January_, 1896. No. 1.--Your telegram 13 January, No. 1, only\r\nreached me last night, after I had left Pretoria. I could if you\r\nconsider it desirable, communicate purport to President of South\r\nAfrican Republic by letter, but I myself think such action would be\r\ninopportune at this moment. Nearly all leading Johannesburg men are\r\nnow in gaol, charged with treason against the State, and it is\r\nrumoured that Government has written evidence of a long-standing and\r\nwidespread conspiracy to seize government of country on the plea of\r\ndenial of political privileges, and to incorporate the country with\r\nthat of British South Africa Company. The truth of these reports will\r\nbe tested in the trials to take place shortly in the High Court, and\r\nmeanwhile to urge claim for extended political privileges for the\r\nvery men so charged would be ineffectual and impolitic. President of\r\nSouth African Republic has already promised municipal government to\r\nJohannesburg, and has stated in a proclamation that all grievances\r\nadvanced in a constitutional manner will be carefully considered and\r\nbrought before the Volksraad without loss of time; but until result\r\nof trials is known nothing of course will now be done.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain replied to the above:\r\n\r\n_15th January_. No. 5.--Referring to your telegram, No. 1, of the\r\n15th January, see my telegram No. 1 of to-day, which was sent before\r\nreceipt of yours. I recognize that the actual moment is not opportune\r\nfor a settlement of the Uitlanders' grievances, and that the position\r\nof the President of the South African Republic may be an embarrassing\r\none, but I do not consider that the arrest of a few score individuals\r\nout of a population of 70,000 or more, or the supposed existence of a\r\nplot amongst that small minority, is a reason for denying to the\r\noverwhelming majority of innocent persons reforms which are just in\r\nthemselves and expedient in the interests of the Republic. Whatever\r\nmay be said about the conduct of a few individuals, nothing can be\r\nplainer than that the sober and industrious majority refused to\r\ncountenance any resort to violence, and proved their readiness to\r\nobey the law and your authority. I hope, therefore, to hear at an\r\nearly date that you propose to resume discussion with President of\r\nSouth African Republic on lines laid down in my previous telegrams. I\r\ndo not see that the matter need wait until the conclusion of the\r\ntrial of the supposed plotters. I am anxious to receive the\r\ninformation asked for in my telegram No. 1 of the 14th January.\r\nPlease communicate at once with the President on this matter.\r\n\r\nThe following is the telegram to which allusion is made above:\r\n\r\n_14th January_. No. 1.--Press telegrams state numerous arrests of\r\nleading residents on the Rand, including many Americans, Germans, and\r\nother nationalities. Fear that number of these arrests of active\r\nmanagers, representatives, may disorganize industry on the Rand. Wish\r\nto know of what accused, when brought to trial, whether bail allowed,\r\nand what penalities prescribed by law. Shall be glad to learn from\r\nPresident of South African Republic what his intentions are in this\r\nmatter, which affects the subjects of so many States. Propose to\r\ncommunicate President's reply to American and Belgian Governments,\r\nwhich have already asked us to take charge of interests of their\r\nrespective citizens.\r\n\r\nSir Hercules Robinson, replied:\r\n\r\n_15th January_. No. 2.--Your telegram of 14th January, No. 1. The\r\naccused are between fifty and sixty in number, and are mostly members\r\nof the Reform Committee. They have been arrested on charge of\r\ntreason, and of seeking to subvert the State by inviting the\r\nco-operation and entrance into it of an armed force. The proceedings\r\nare based, I understand, on sworn information, and the trials will\r\ntake place before High Court. The accused are being well treated, and\r\nare represented by able counsel. It is alleged that Government has\r\ndocumentary evidence of a widespread conspiracy to seize upon\r\nGovernment, and make use of the wealth of the country to rehabilitate\r\nfinances of British South Africa Company. On taking leave of\r\nPresident of South African Republic, I urged on him moderation as\r\nregards the accused, so as not to alienate the sympathy he now enjoys\r\nof all right-minded persons. Bail is a matter entirely in the hands\r\nof Attorney-General. The Government seem acting within their legal\r\nrights, and I do not see how I can interfere. Mines are at work, and\r\nindustry does not seem to be disorganized.\r\n\r\nWhile still on his way to Capetown, the High Commissioner telegraphed\r\nto Mr. Chamberlain again in a manner indicating his complete\r\nabandonment of the position taken up by him in relation to\r\nJohannesburg--in fact, his repudiation of what his own words have\r\nrecorded against him:\r\n\r\n_16th January_. No. i.--Your telegram of 15th January, No. 1,\r\nreceived. I cannot at this moment follow the complications arising\r\nfrom supposed missing and crossing telegrams, but can only say that\r\nno telegram which has reached me from you has remained unanswered.\r\n\r\nNo promise was made to Johannesburg by me as an inducement to disarm,\r\nexcept that the promises made in the President's previous\r\nproclamation would be adhered to, and that Jameson and the other\r\nprisoners would not be transferred until Johannesburg had\r\nunconditionally laid down its arms and surrendered. I sent your long\r\ntelegram of 4th January to President; _but the question of\r\nconcessions to Uitlanders has never been discussed between us_.\r\nPending result of coming trials, and the extent to which Johannesburg\r\nis implicated in the alleged conspiracy to subvert the State is made\r\nclear, the question of political privileges would not be entertained\r\nby Government of the South African Republic.\r\n\r\nHe justified the change of policy in another communication addressed\r\nto Mr. Chamberlain before he reached Capetown:\r\n\r\n_16th January_. No. 3.--Your telegram of the 15th January, No. 5. If\r\nyou will leave the matter in my hands, I will _resume_ advocacy of\r\nUitlanders' claims at the first moment I think it can be done with\r\nadvantage; the present moment is most inopportune, as the strongest\r\nfeeling of irritation and indignation against the Uitlanders exists\r\nboth amongst the Burghers and Members of Volksraad of both Republics.\r\nAny attempt to dictate in regard to the internal affairs of South\r\nAfrican Republic at this moment would be resisted by all parties in\r\nSouth Africa, and would do great harm.\r\n\r\nI have already replied in my telegram of 15th January, No. 2, in\r\nanswer to your telegram of 14th January, No. 1, and I do not think it\r\npossible to obtain further information at this stage, the matter\r\nbeing _sub judice_.\r\n\r\nSir Hercules Robinson left Pretoria on the 14th, having resided\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of Dr. Jameson and his comrades for a\r\nweek, and of the Reform prisoners for four days, without making any\r\nattempt whatever to ascertain their circumstances or story. During\r\nthat time his military secretary called upon Dr. Jameson for the\r\npurpose of finding out details of the prisoners and wounded of the\r\nforce, but made no further inquiries. Dr. Jameson's solicitor wrote\r\nto the Colonial Office on March 5:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FAIRFIELD,\r\n\r\nYou have probably seen the cable that has come to the _Diggers'\r\nNews_, giving the lie direct to Sir John Willoughby's statement\r\nrespecting terms of surrender.\r\n\r\nI have seen Sir John again, and am authorized by him to state, with\r\nregard to the criticism that it is incredible that nothing should\r\nhave been said by the officers when in prison at Pretoria to anybody\r\nabout the terms of surrender, that it must be remembered that from\r\nthe time of the surrender until they left Africa none of them were\r\nallowed to make any communication. While in gaol they were not\r\nallowed to see newspapers or to receive any news of what was going on\r\nin Pretoria or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSir J. Willoughby made a statement to the head gaoler and other\r\nofficials at the time of his arrival at the gaol when he was searched\r\nand all his papers taken from him. He requested to be allowed to keep\r\nthe document signed by Cronjé, as it contained the terms of the\r\nsurrender, but received as answer that all papers must be taken and\r\nthat they would be returned afterwards. They were in fact taken and\r\nonly returned when the officers were removed from the gaol to go to\r\nDurban.\r\n\r\nMy clients did try to get a note through to Johannesburg concealed in\r\na matchbox. They paid twenty-five pounds to get it through, and sent\r\nit within thirty-six hours of their arrival in gaol, but they have\r\nnever been able to ascertain whether it reached its destination.\r\n\r\nThe gist of it was that they were all right. It never occurred to the\r\nprisoners that neither the British Resident nor the High Commissioner\r\nwould be informed of the terms of the surrender, or that they would\r\nnot satisfy themselves on this point.\r\n\r\nSir Hercules Robinson might urge, in so far as Dr. Jameson's affair\r\nis concerned, that he could not be expected to suspect a deception\r\nsuch as was practised upon him; yet it does seem extraordinary that,\r\nbeing in Pretoria for the purpose of negotiating for the disposal of\r\nDr. Jameson and his comrades, he should not have taken steps to\r\nascertain what there was to be said on their behalf, especially as on\r\nhis own showing it was for the greater part of the time a question of\r\nlife and death for the leaders of the force. It is even more\r\ndifficult to understand why no effort should have been made to\r\ncommunicate with the Reformers. The High Commissioner was thoroughly\r\nwell aware of the negotiations between them and the Government on\r\nJanuary 1. He had received communications by telegraph from the\r\nReformers before he left Capetown; he came up avowedly to settle\r\ntheir business; he negotiated on their behalf and induced them to\r\ndisarm; he witnessed their arrest and confinement in gaol; yet not\r\nonly did he not visit them himself, nor send an accredited member of\r\nhis staff to inquire into their case and conditions, but Sir Jacobus\r\nde Wet alleges that he actually, in deference to the wish of the\r\nPresident, desired the British Agent not to hold any communication\r\nwhatever with the prisoners during his (Sir Hercules Robinson's)\r\nstay in Pretoria. Truly we have had many examples of President\r\nKruger's audacity, and of the success of it; but nothing to equal\r\nthis. That he demanded from Sir Hercules Robinson information as to\r\nthe objects of the Flying Squadron and the movements of British\r\ntroops in British territory, and succeeded in getting it, was a\r\ntriumph; but surely not on a par with that of desiring the High\r\nCommissioner not to hold communication with the British subjects whom\r\nhe, as the official representative of their sovereign, had travelled\r\na thousand miles to disarm, and on whose behalf--ostensibly--he was\r\nthere to negotiate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nARREST AND TRIAL OF THE REFORMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout half of the members of the Reform Committee were arrested and\r\ntaken through to Pretoria on the night of the 9th. Others were\r\narrested at various times during the evening and night, were detained\r\nin the lock-up at Johannesburg as ordinary felons, and escorted to\r\nthe Pretoria gaol on the following morning. The scene on their\r\narrival at Pretoria railway station and during their march to the\r\ngaol was not creditable to the Boers. A howling mob surrounded the\r\nprisoners, hustling them, striking them, and hurling abuse at them\r\nincessantly. The mounted burghers acting as an escort forced their\r\nhorses at the unfortunate men on foot, jostling them and threatening\r\nto ride them down. One of the prisoners, a man close on sixty years\r\nof age, was thrown by an excited patriot and kicked and trampled on\r\nbefore he was rescued by some of his comrades.\r\n\r\nOnce within the gaol, the men were searched and locked up in the\r\ncells, and treated exactly as black or white felons of the lowest\r\ndescription. In many cases four or five men were incarcerated in\r\nsingle cells 9 feet long by 5 feet 6 inches wide, with one small\r\ngrating for ventilation. At night they were obliged to lie on the mud\r\nfloor, or in some cases on filthy straw mattresses left in the cells\r\nby former occupants. No provision was made by which they could obtain\r\nblankets or other covering--indeed at first it was not necessary, as\r\nthe overcrowding and lack of ventilation very nearly resulted in\r\nasphyxiation. With an inhumanity almost incredible, in one instance\r\none of the prisoners, suffering from fever and dysentery, was locked\r\nup for twelve hours with four others in such a cell without any\r\nsanitary provisions whatever. Friends in Pretoria induced the\r\nauthorities, by means not unpopular in that place, to admit a better\r\nclass of food than that allowed to the ordinary prisoners; and it is\r\nstated that the first meal enjoyed by the Reformers cost close upon\r\n£100 for introduction. Day by day fresh concessions were obtained in\r\na similar manner, with the result that before long the prisoners were\r\nallowed to have their own clothing and beds and such food as they\r\nchose to order. Nothing however could alter the indescribable\r\nsanitary conditions, nor compensate for the fact that the cells\r\noccupied by these men were in many cases swarming with vermin.\r\n\r\nThe climate in Pretoria in January is almost tropical, and the\r\nsufferings of many of the older and less robust men under such\r\ncircumstances were very considerable. On the eleventh day of\r\nincarceration the majority of the prisoners were let out on bail of\r\n£2,000 each; in the cases of two or three bail of £4,000 each was\r\nrequired; but bail was refused to Colonel Rhodes, Messrs. Phillips,\r\nFarrar, Hammond (the signatories to the letter), and J.P.\r\nFitzPatrick, the secretary of the Reform Committee. These five\r\ncontinued to occupy the undesirable premises for four weeks more, at\r\nthe end of which time, owing to the serious effect upon their health\r\nwhich imprisonment under these conditions had produced, and owing to\r\nthe repeated representations within the Transvaal and from the\r\nBritish Government as well, an alteration was made under somewhat\r\nnovel conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was notified to the public that the Government had graciously\r\nconsented to admit the prisoners to bail. The terms, however, were\r\nnot at the time publicly announced. First and foremost it was\r\nrequired of them that they should deposit £10,000 in sovereigns each\r\nas security that they would not break the conditions of their altered\r\nimprisonment. They were to reside in a cottage in Pretoria under\r\nstrong guard, and they were to pay the whole of the costs of their\r\ndetention, including the salary and living expenses of the officer\r\nand guard placed over them. The cost, including interest upon the\r\nmoney deposited, was upwards of £1,000 a month.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary examination into the charges against the Reformers\r\nbegan on February 3, and lasted about a month. It resulted in the\r\ncommittal for trial, on the charge of high treason, of all those\r\narrested. The Imperial Government having decided to send a\r\nrepresentative to watch the trial on behalf of the British, American\r\nand Belgian subjects, Mr. J. Rose Innes, Q.C., the leader of the Bar\r\nin Cape Colony, attended on their behalf. It was intimated to the\r\nTransvaal Government that Mr. Innes would represent the Imperial\r\nGovernment; but objection was made to this on the grounds that he had\r\nbeen admitted to the Pretoria Bar during the British administration,\r\nand had failed to comply with a subsequent rule of Court which\r\nrequired some sort of registration; and permission was refused to him\r\nto address the Court. The objection was maintained, and Mr. Innes was\r\nobliged to limit his participation in the affair to sitting at the\r\ncounsels' table and consulting and advising with the Pretoria\r\nbarristers employed to defend the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe examination was, as Dr. Coster the State Attorney announced, of\r\nthe nature of a fishing examination, and he claimed to be permitted\r\nto conduct it in a manner which, he alleged, is popular in Holland,\r\nbut which is entirely unknown in the Transvaal, and certainly does\r\nnot obtain in any British possession. The chief feature of this\r\nsystem appears to be a total disregard of the rules applying to\r\nevidence. A few instances will suffice. One of the first witnesses\r\ncalled was Judge Ameshof, who with Chief-Justice Kotzé and Mr. Kock\r\nformed the Government Commission appointed to meet the deputation\r\nfrom the Reform Committee on January 1. Judge Ameshof was duly sworn,\r\nand was asked to identify a list of the members of the Reform\r\nCommittee. He did so. He stated that it was the list supplied to the\r\nGovernment Commission at the meeting of January 1 by the deputation\r\nof the Reform Committee, and he regarded it therefore as authentic.\r\nThe deputation had stated to the Commission that it was so.\r\n\r\nThis was the first revelation of the tactics about to be pursued by\r\nthe Government, in using information which had been given under\r\nprivilege and in good faith by the prisoners themselves, when\r\nnegotiating with the Government prior to any question of arrest being\r\nraised. Mr. Wessels, counsel for the accused, rose to obtain from\r\nJudge Ameshof the official account of the meeting, desiring to prove\r\nthis very important negotiation by means of witnesses on the\r\nGovernment side. He got no further however than saying to the\r\nwitness, 'You said you were a member of the Government Commission?'\r\nwhen Judge Ameshof replied, 'Yes, but if you are going to ask me\r\nabout anything that took place at that meeting, I cannot answer,\r\nbecause the meeting was a privileged one.' Mr. Wessels did not lose\r\nhis opportunity, 'You have stated,' he said, 'that you are a Judge of\r\nthe High Court?' The witness signified assent. 'And you mean to tell\r\nme,' Mr. Wessels continued, 'that you feel yourself free to divulge\r\nso much as it suits the Government to reveal, but that as soon as I\r\nwish to prove something to my clients' advantage the interview\r\nbecomes privileged?' The witness did not answer, and Mr. Wessels\r\nappealed to the Court. Judicial Commissioner Zeiler, however, upheld\r\nthe witness's contention. Mr. Wessels urged in reply that if it was a\r\nprivileged interview he objected to any evidence whatever being given\r\nin connection with it, and protested vehemently against the admission\r\nof the list of members just sworn to. The objection was overruled,\r\nand it was thus laid down that the interview was privileged as far as\r\nthe Government was concerned, but not in so far as it could benefit\r\nthe Reformers.\r\n\r\nAnother case was that of Mr. Schumacher, a witness who testified,\r\n_inter alia_, that he did not know what the objects of a certain\r\nDevelopment Syndicate were. His evidence showed that he had not been\r\ninformed upon this point. He was very hard pressed by the State\r\nAttorney, but he adhered to his first answer. Dr. Coster then altered\r\nhis tactics and asked, 'Had you no opinions on the subject? Did you\r\nnot guess at all?' The witness replied that he might have thought and\r\nconjectured at various times, but that he had nothing in the nature\r\nof information or knowledge on the point. This did not satisfy Dr.\r\nCoster, who then pressed the question, 'Well, what did you think?\r\nWhat were your thoughts?' The witness objected to state what his\r\nthoughts were, as they could have no bearing on the fact, and might\r\nbe absolutely wide of the mark. He could only repeat that he had no\r\nknowledge. The witness appealed to the Bench for protection. Mr.\r\nWessels urged that it was an unheard-of proceeding to compel a\r\nwitness to state what he thought and to use it as evidence. The\r\nobjections were again overruled, and the witness was ordered by\r\nthe Court to answer. His reply afforded no satisfaction to the\r\nGovernment, being to the effect that he could not then remember what\r\nhis thoughts were at various times. On the application of the State\r\nAttorney the Judicial Commissioner sent him to gaol for twelve hours\r\nfor contempt of court.\r\n\r\nMr. Wessels strenuously objected to the decision and applied to the\r\nCourt to stay imprisonment to enable him to appeal to a judge in\r\nchambers, but even this was refused. Mr. Wessels in the course of his\r\naddress received a reprimand from the Bench for stating that he now\r\nrecognized the force of the State Attorney's contention that the law\r\nof evidence as obtaining in South Africa was not sufficiently wide;\r\nfor, he added, he thought it would suit the purpose of the Government\r\nbetter if they reverted to an older system under which racks and\r\nthumbscrews were popular.\r\n\r\nThe witness was sent to gaol. Some hours later an appeal was heard by\r\nJudge de Korté in chambers, and the decision of the Judicial\r\nCommissioner was reversed, but the prisoner had already completed\r\nseven hours' imprisonment in a dirty cell. Judge de Korté stated that\r\nhe had reversed the decision after consultation with Chief Justice\r\nKotzé, and it was felt that something at least had been achieved by\r\nMr. Schumacher, and the rights of a witness would be recognized. But\r\nthe end is not always in sight in dealing with the Transvaal\r\nGovernment. The State Attorney in turn appealed from the single\r\njudge's decision to the full Bench. Judge Morice, a Scotchman, many\r\nyears a judge of the High Court, supported the decision of Judge de\r\nKorté. The Chief Justice, who had advised Judge de Korté in his\r\ndecision however in a most extraordinary judgment now reversed it,\r\nand in this view he was supported by Judge Ameshof--himself a witness\r\nin the case against the Reformers.\r\n\r\nThus the majority judgment of the High Court against the Reformers on\r\nthis principle of evidence happened to be formulated by the two\r\njudges who had been appointed to negotiate with the Reformers'\r\ndeputation on behalf of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of obtaining justice in the Courts of the Transvaal\r\nunder the then conditions was thus brought home to the prisoners. An\r\nappeal from the decision of the Lower Court on Judge Ameshof's\r\ninterpretation of privilege, which had been seriously discussed, was\r\nthen abandoned as being worse than useless, and calculated only to\r\nprovoke more extreme measures against the prisoners by placing the\r\nBench in a ridiculous position. It could not be expected that the\r\nChief Justice, who was himself a member of the Government Commission\r\nwhich Judge Ameshof had claimed to be privileged, would take any\r\nother view than that favouring the policy and convenience of the\r\nGovernment which he showed himself so ready to befriend.\r\n\r\nIn the Schumacher appeal case before the full Court, Dr. Coster had\r\nmade no secret that he intended to disregard the rules and precedents\r\ngoverning the treatment of witnesses, and even claimed that he should\r\nreceive no opposition from the prisoners' counsel, since he was only\r\n'_fishing_' for evidence and not actually accumulating it against the\r\nprisoners, and had no intention of using the evidence given at this\r\nexamination. Mr. Wessels asked him whether he would pledge himself to\r\nthis effect, and what, for instance, would be done in case a witness\r\nwho had been heard at the preliminary examination should die before\r\nthe main trial came off. The reply was, that in such a case of course\r\nthe Government would be bound to use some of the evidence, but would\r\nuse it with discretion and not unfairly. This undertaking provoked\r\nsmiles even in court. The wisdom and fairness of Mr. Wessels'\r\ncontention were fully justified when the trial actually did take\r\nplace, for the whole of the evidence of the preliminary examination\r\nwas handed in for the guidance of the judge in determining his\r\nsentences against the accused. It may be added that each witness was\r\ncalled upon to sign the notes of his evidence as taken down in Dutch.\r\nWhen required, the official reporter read a free translation of the\r\nnotes to the witness before they were signed.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the examination all the prisoners were committed\r\non the same charge--that of high treason--no distinction whatever\r\nbeing made in the references to them from the Bench. By this time Mr.\r\nHammond, who had been ill, was released on bail of £20,000 in order\r\nto go to the seaside.\r\n\r\nApplication was made on behalf of Colonel Rhodes, Messrs. Phillips,\r\nFarrar, and FitzPatrick for release on bail, upon the grounds that no\r\ndistinction whatever had been made between them and the other\r\nprisoners who had already been released, but this was refused after\r\nthe point had been reserved for consideration by the State Attorney\r\nin consultation with the Chief Justice, and the four men returned to\r\ntheir former conditions of imprisonment. Mr. Chamberlain continued to\r\nmake representations on behalf of these men, and at one time it\r\nappeared as though the restrictions would be removed, Dr. Coster\r\nhaving pledged himself to accept bail, and having actually drawn out\r\nthe bail-bonds and submitted them to the solicitors of the accused\r\nfor approval, and every arrangement having been completed--even to\r\nthe finding of the additional security. They were however at the last\r\nmoment curtly informed that bail would not be allowed. On this being\r\nreported to Mr. Chamberlain, he at once replied to the effect that he\r\ncould not believe that a Government would revoke a promise made on\r\ntheir behalf by the State Attorney. Dr. Leyds, on behalf of his\r\nGovernment, stated that the matter was in the hands of the State\r\nAttorney alone and did not concern the Executive, and that on inquiry\r\nhe found that no such promise had been made and no undertaking given.\r\nThe incident is more or less trivial, but again shows the readiness\r\nwith which the Boer Government repudiate a promise when it is to\r\ntheir convenience to do so. Dr. Coster on his side admitted with\r\nexpressions of regret that there had been a breach of undertaking,\r\nand stated that it had been done by order of the Executive Council.\r\n\r\nCommunications between Mr. Chamberlain and the Pretoria Government\r\nwere of great frequency during this period. The phantom of Mr.\r\nKruger's visit to England was chased with great assiduity. The wily\r\nold President seized on Mr. Chamberlain's suggestions as an excellent\r\npretext for delay to enable him to spread his nets, and he used the\r\ntime to great advantage. But this was not the worst! Mr.\r\nChamberlain's new diplomacy and his stupid or treacherous advisers\r\nled him into blunders; as when, for instance, he tried to bounce\r\nwithout the intention of making good his implied threats; and when\r\nhe sent his 4th of February despatch (publishing it in London before\r\nit reached Pretoria), strongly and ably reviewing the position, but\r\nspoiling all by a proposal which, whilst it had not been suggested to\r\nor discussed by the Rand people, and would not have been acceptable\r\nto them in lieu of what they had demanded, was also an interference\r\nin the internal affairs of the Transvaal. It gave the Pretoria\r\nGovernment an opportunity, which they did not miss, of severely\r\nsnubbing Mr. Chamberlain. When the latter in turn peremptorily\r\nrefused their demands, he was informed that the cancellation of the\r\nLondon Convention would not be pressed '_at present_,' but might\r\nremain in abeyance.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period prior to the main trial, President Kruger\r\ncontinued to use with great effect 'the wishes and intentions of his\r\nburghers.' When bail was first refused to the leaders this course was\r\njustified on the grounds that the burghers were strongly against it,\r\nand that the President could not act against their wishes. When at a\r\nlater stage a petition was presented by a number of burghers more or\r\nless in touch with the Uitlander community, who felt that the\r\ntreatment of the leaders was having a bad effect, counter petitions\r\ncame in within a day or two urging the Government on no account to\r\nextend the privilege of bail to these men. Oddly enough, these\r\npetitions were got up and signed by relatives and near connexions of\r\nthe President himself.\r\n\r\nDuring this period another petition was presented which is surely\r\nwithout parallel in a civilized state; but it illustrates admirably\r\nthe Boer idea of right and liberty. Fifty burghers in the district of\r\nStanderton addressed the Government, pointing out the undesirability\r\nof allowing a 'certain Advocate Wessels to defend the Jameson\r\nrebels,' and praying that the Government would put him over the\r\nborder, 'which is the slightest punishment that can be inflicted upon\r\nhim.' The receipt of this petition was announced in the Government\r\norgan, the _Press_, on March 25.\r\n\r\nAt about this time another incident occurred which excited\r\nconsiderable feeling. Commandant Henning Pretorius, one of the most\r\nprominent Boer officials, having paid a visit to his native district\r\nin the Cape Colony shortly after the Jameson raid, purchased from\r\nthe owner of a farm at Cookhouse Drift the beam from which the five\r\nBoers had been hanged at Slagter's Nek for rebellion in the year\r\n1816. Reference has already been made in the first chapter to this\r\ndeplorable affair. The beam (which had been built into the house) was\r\nbrought up by the purchaser to Pretoria. He states, and no doubt\r\ntruly, that he obtained the historical relic for the purpose of\r\nadding it to the National Museum; but it must be added that the time\r\nwas not well chosen unless the intention was to rouse feeling. The\r\n_Volksstem_, the Hollander-Boer organ, in an extremely violent\r\narticle, described in detail the Slagter's Nek executions, and called\r\nupon the burghers to avenge on the persons of the Reformers their\r\nmurdered countrymen; and it is a fact vouched for by persons by no\r\nmeans friendly to the Uitlander that certain Boers approached\r\nPresident Kruger, intimating to him that the beam had arrived, that\r\nit would not be necessary to bother about a trial, but that the four\r\nmen should be hanged out of hand from the same scaffold which had\r\nserved for their compatriots. It is but right to say that President\r\nKruger's reply was a severe reprimand, and a reminder that they were\r\nnot a barbarous people, but should comply with the law. The matter\r\nhaving been brought to the notice of Mr. Chamberlain, strong\r\nrepresentations were made upon the subject, to which the Transvaal\r\nGovernment replied (forgetful apparently of the fact that the\r\nPresident had frequently urged his inability to control his burghers)\r\nthat the Transvaal was a civilized State, that the burghers were\r\nlaw-abiding and peaceful people, and that their Government was at all\r\ntimes able to control them. It was interesting to see the argument of\r\nthe burghers getting out of hand, which was used with such effect in\r\nthe case of Dr. Jameson and quoted by Sir Hercules Robinson, recoil\r\nupon the head of its originator.\r\n\r\nA final effort was made by the people of Johannesburg to obtain the\r\nrelease on bail of the four prisoners. A petition bearing the\r\nsignatures of 20,000 persons was presented; the gentlemen bearing the\r\npetition were informed that it could not be received; that they must\r\ncall again. Having called again and again, the petition was at last\r\naccepted and placed before the Government; but no reply was ever\r\nvouchsafed. The treatment of this memorial is in sharp contrast\r\nwith that accorded to the one presented by a score or so of the\r\nPresident's relatives and supporters--objecting to the release.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the arrests until just before the trial speculation\r\nwas rife as to which judge would preside. The Chief Justice and Judge\r\nAmeshof could hardly sit (even allowing for the precedents already\r\nestablished by them), since they had both acted on the Government\r\nCommission in negotiating with the prisoners, and one of them had\r\nalready given evidence against the accused. There remained Justices\r\nJorissen, De Korté and Morice. Mr. De Korté was then threatened with\r\nsuspension owing to pecuniary embarrassments, and would evidently not\r\nbe allowed to preside. The fifth judge, Mr. Jorissen, had expressed\r\nhimself so violently against the Reformers that he had himself\r\nrecognized the impossibility of attaining an impartial attitude, and\r\nhad refused to sit. The only judge available was therefore Mr.\r\nJustice Morice, against whom there was no valid objection whatever.\r\nMoreover, in the ordinary routine it so happened that it was his turn\r\nto preside at the forthcoming trial; but he was known to hold Liberal\r\nviews and to be strongly in sympathy with internal reform.\r\n\r\nAt this time Chief-Justice Kotzé undertook several journeys to the\r\nFree State and Cape Colony, ostensibly to rid himself of insomnia,\r\nbut in reality, as results proved, in order to employ a judge for\r\nthis trial. His choice eventually fell upon Mr. Gregorowski, formerly\r\na judge in the Free State, and at that time State-Attorney to that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregorowski was noted on the Bench for the peculiar severity of\r\nhis sentences on all except Boers. He had moreover expressed openly\r\nin Bloemfontein his wish that he might have the trying of 'those\r\nReformers; he would give them what for.' These things were not known\r\nat the time of the trial; nor had the fact yet come out that before\r\ntaking the oath of office he had endeavoured to borrow from at least\r\none of his colleagues a black cap for the forthcoming trial. His\r\nattitude at the time is sufficiently indicated by what he wrote\r\nshortly after the trial, in defence of his action, '_I came up to put\r\ndown rebellion._ I have done so with a strong hand, and I believe\r\nthat my judgment will bear good fruit in the future.' The prisoners\r\ncould not but contrast the action of the Government in employing and\r\nappointing, on approval, a judge who had no status whatever in the\r\ncountry, with their action in declining to allow Mr. Rose Innes to\r\nappear at the Bar on the pretext of his previous qualification not\r\nbeing in order; and it was felt to be ominous that an independent and\r\nupright judge, against whom there could be no objection, should be\r\npassed over, and another specially imported for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe trial was at last fixed to take place on April 27, and the\r\nindictments were served upon the accused six days before that date.\r\nThe following is the list of those who were committed for trial:\r\n\r\n  Lionel Phillips\r\n  Colonel F.W.

Curtis{34}\r\n\r\nThe indictment served on all alike was as follows:\r\n\r\nH.J. Coster, State Attorney of the South African Republic, who, on\r\nbehalf of the State, prosecutes, brings to the notice of the Court:\r\n\r\nThat they (citing the accused), all and each or one or more of them,\r\nare guilty of the crime of High Treason:\r\n\r\nFirstly: In that in or about the months of November and December in\r\nthe year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, the\r\nexact dates being unknown to the State Attorney, they, the said\r\naccused, at Johannesburg, Witwatersrand Goldfields, South African\r\nRepublic, being citizens of, or residing in, this Republic, all and\r\neach or one or more of them wrongfully, unlawfully, and with a\r\nhostile intention to disturb, injure, or bring into danger the\r\nindependence or safety of this Republic, treated, conspired, agreed\r\nwith and urged Leander Starr Jameson, an alien, residing without the\r\nboundaries of this Republic, to come into the territory of this\r\nRepublic at the head of and with an armed and hostile troop, and to\r\nmake a hostile invasion and to march through to Johannesburg\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nSecondly: In that they (the said accused), being citizens of, or\r\nresiding in, this Republic, all and each or one or more of them,\r\nthere and then in conjunction with Charles Leonard and Dr. H. Wolff,\r\nnow fugitives, and other persons unknown to the State Attorney,\r\nappearing and acting as a committee, by them named the 'Reform\r\nCommittee,' after the above-mentioned Leander Starr Jameson, on or\r\nabout December 29, in the year aforesaid, had come from without the\r\nRepublic, at the head of and with an armed and hostile troop, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ottoshoop, district Marico, into the territory of\r\nthis Republic, and had made a hostile invasion, and had violently\r\nattempted to penetrate through to Johannesburg aforesaid, wrongfully,\r\nunlawfully, and with a hostile intention to disturb, injure, or bring\r\ninto danger the independence or safety of this Republic, gave, or\r\nattempted to give, the aforementioned Leander Starr Jameson during\r\nhis hostile invasion aforesaid information about the state of the\r\ndefences at Johannesburg, and had armed troops ready to assist, and\r\nsent assistance to him, and subsequently by seditious speeches made,\r\nor caused to be made, in public, with the object to persuade and\r\ninduce the people there to stand by the aforementioned Jameson in his\r\nhostile invasion, and further have assisted him, the aforementioned\r\nJameson, during his hostile invasion above mentioned, by providing\r\nhim with provisions, forage, and horses.\r\n\r\nThirdly: That in or about the month of December, in the year\r\naforesaid, and in the month of January in the year one thousand eight\r\nhundred and ninety-six, exact dates not known to the State Attorney,\r\nat Johannesburg aforesaid, they (the said accused), being inhabitants\r\nof, and residing in, this Republic, all and each or one or more of\r\nthem, then and there, in conjunction with Charles Leonard and Dr. H.\r\nWolff, now fugitives, and other persons unknown to the State\r\nAttorney, appearing and acting as a committee named by them the\r\n'Reform Committee,' wrongfully and unlawfully, and with a hostile\r\nintention to disturb, injure, or bring into danger the independence\r\nor safety of this Republic, have distributed, or caused to be\r\ndistributed, amongst the population there, and in the neighbourhood\r\nthereof, Maxim guns, other weapons, arms, and ammunition; further,\r\nhave enrolled men, or have caused them to be enrolled, and have\r\nformed them, or have caused them to be formed, into military corps;\r\nhave erected there, or caused to be erected, earthworks and other\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nFourthly: In that in or about the month of December and the month of\r\nJanuary, the exact dates being unknown to the State Attorney, and at\r\nJohannesburg aforesaid they (the said accused), being citizens of,\r\nand residing in, this Republic, all and each or one or more of them,\r\nthen and there, in conjunction with Charles Leonard and Dr. H. Wolff,\r\nnow fugitives, and other persons unknown to the State Attorney,\r\nappearing and acting as a committee called by them the 'Reform\r\nCommittee,' wrongfully and unlawfully, with hostile intention to\r\ndisturb, injure, or bring into danger the independence or safety of\r\nthis Republic, have arrogated to themselves, and have exercised and\r\ncaused to be exercised, the functions, and powers belonging to the\r\nauthorities of this Republic; by violence, or by threats of violence,\r\nhave compelled, or caused to be compelled, the police of this\r\nRepublic stationed at Johannesburg aforesaid to leave the public\r\nsquares and streets; have formed, or caused to be formed, their own\r\npolice corps, and have provided that corps, or caused it to be\r\nprovided, with guns and other arms; and further have appointed, or\r\ncaused to be appointed, as head of that corps, Andrew Trimble, and\r\nhave entrusted him with jurisdiction in police cases, in virtue\r\nwhereof the aforementioned Andrew Trimble has passed sentence and\r\ncaused it to be carried out.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all which acts abovementioned the independence of\r\nthis country was brought into danger, and its safety disturbed and\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nWherefore the State Attorney, after due proof and conviction thereof,\r\nrequests the judgment of this Court against said accused, according\r\nto law.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion based upon the character of the evidence adduced\r\nat the preliminary examination was that it would be impossible to\r\nsustain the charge of high treason; but the disclosure of the\r\ndocuments in the possession of the State Attorney put a different\r\ncomplexion upon the case. Then for the first time the members of the\r\nReform Committee became aware of that factor in their case which has\r\nsince become famous as 'de trommel van Bobby White'--Major Robert\r\nWhite's despatch-box--a veritable conjurer's hat, from which Mr.\r\nKruger produced to an admiring and astonished world the political\r\nequivalents of eggs and goldfish, pigeons and white mice. In this box\r\n(which was taken with the invading force at Doornkop) it appears\r\nMajor White had brought as much of his previous correspondence as he\r\ncould conveniently carry, together with diaries, notebooks,\r\ncode-books, cipher-keys, etc. Nor was this all. He had brought a copy\r\nof the letter of invitation, certified by himself as magistrate in\r\nthe Bechuanaland Protectorate. Revelations at and subsequent to the\r\ntrial show that the State Attorney, on discovering this copy and\r\nfinding that as a copy it would not be admitted and that he might\r\nexperience some difficulty in proving it, prevailed upon Major White\r\nwhile in the Pretoria gaol to confirm his previous certificate, and\r\nto make an affidavit to the effect that he had compared the letter\r\nwith the original, that it was a true copy, and that he had examined\r\nthe signatures, and believed them to be the signatures of the persons\r\nindicated. The State Attorney alleges that he bargained with Major\r\nWhite for this affidavit, and in return surrendered to him certain\r\nprivate documents which had also been taken in the despatch-box.\r\nMajor White on the other hand stated to the writer and to another\r\nmember of the Reform Committee--Mr. H.C. Hull--that there is no truth\r\nin the allegation that he received a _quid pro quo_; but has no\r\nexcuse to offer for making the affidavit, except that he--_'does not\r\nremember having done it.'_\r\n\r\nThe Reform prisoners, who, animated by a desire not to give any of\r\ntheir comrades away, had for a period of close upon four months borne\r\nall the abuse which could be heaped upon them, and had abstained from\r\nmaking any defence in public, or any of those revelations such as\r\nhave since been made through the exertion of the Transvaal\r\nauthorities, the Select Committee of the Cape House of Assembly, and\r\nthe Bow Street officers, found to their inexpressible disgust that\r\nthe efforts which they had made were rendered futile by the capture\r\nof these documents; and they were highly incensed at the action of\r\none of the very men whose lives they believed they had saved by\r\nsurrendering on January 7. The affidavit was looked upon as\r\nunpardonable, and the unnecessary statement regarding the genuineness\r\nof the signatures was interpreted in a very unpleasant sense.\r\n\r\nConsultations now took place between Mr. Advocate Wessels and Mr.\r\nRichard Solomon, Q.C., of Kimberley, who had also been retained on\r\nbehalf of the accused; and endeavours were made to obtain from the\r\nState Attorney details of the evidence which it was proposed to\r\nbring, but with only partial success. From the facts already known to\r\nthem it was clear that the Government were determined to stretch\r\nevery point in law to their own advantage and to indulge in few\r\nscruples as to the means to be employed to secure a conviction. The\r\nJudge, it was known, had been specially imported for this trial,\r\nand provisionally appointed to a seat on the Bench. As the\r\nconfirmation of his appointment was to take place when the Volksraad\r\nshould meet, or at any rate at some period subsequent to the trial,\r\nit was not unnatural to regard his as a case in which a judge was\r\nappointed on approval, the appointment to be either confirmed or\r\ncancelled according to the satisfaction which he should give.\r\n\r\nAppeal to the full bench of the High Court had already been proved to\r\nbe entirely useless; since the only judges to whom appeal could be\r\nmade were those who had in the earlier stages associated themselves\r\nwith the Government against the Reform Committee, and later on in\r\ntheir judicial capacities confirmed the attitude taken up by them as\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\nThe options before the prisoners were therefore three in number. One\r\ncourse would be to enter upon a protracted trial before a Boer jury\r\nand a specially-appointed judge, with the certainty for the majority\r\nof an adverse verdict in any case. In such a trial numberless\r\noccasions would arise for the exercise of discretion in the admission\r\nor rejection of evidence, and any defence of the prisoners must\r\nnecessarily partake of the character of an indictment against the\r\nGovernment and the faction which both judge and jury avowedly\r\nrepresented, and tend only to aggravate the penalty. They would\r\nmoreover have to face that trial as a body of over sixty men, many of\r\nwhom could have reasonably set up special defences, many of whom were\r\nnot even mentioned in any evidence which the Government had yet\r\nsecured (with the exception of course of Judge Ameshof's _privileged_\r\nlist), and could therefore reasonably expect to be discharged on\r\nmaking individual defences. The second alternative was to decline to\r\nplead at all, on the ground that they had negotiated with the\r\nGovernment in good faith, and that a treacherous arrest and breach of\r\nunderstandings arrived at would not be recognised in any way by\r\nthem--in fact, to refuse to condone treachery or take a hand in a\r\nfarce. The third course was to plead guilty, and take a short cut on\r\nthe best terms possible to what was realized to be a pre-arranged\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe second alternative was rejected, because it was found to be\r\nimpossible to secure unanimity of action. In the course of the\r\ndiscussions upon the other alternatives, certain negotiations took\r\nplace between the State Attorney Dr. Coster and Mr. Wessels, the\r\nresult of which was that Dr. Coster made the following offer: If the\r\nleaders (the signatories to the letter of invitation) would consent\r\nto plead guilty to count 1 of the indictment, he would agree to\r\nwithdraw as against them counts 2, 3, and 4; and in such case he\r\nwould agree that the rank and file should plead guilty to counts 3\r\nand 4 only, he withdrawing as against them counts 1 and 2. The matter\r\nwas discussed by the prisoners, and objection was taken to that part\r\nof the indictment in which it was stated that the Reform Committee\r\nhad acted 'with a hostile intention to disturb, injure or bring into\r\ndanger the independence or safety of this Republic.'\r\n\r\nAnother meeting took place between the State Attorney and Mr.\r\nWessels, at which Dr. Coster agreed to eliminate from the indictment\r\nagainst the rank and file the words objected to, provided that the\r\nleaders would plead guilty to count 1. Having arrived at this--to\r\nhim--satisfactory conclusion, Dr. Coster remarked that they (_i.e.,_\r\nall except the four) were now charged with a merely nominal offence.\r\nMr. Wessels endeavoured to obtain the same alteration in the\r\nindictment of the leaders, but this was refused on the ground that it\r\nwould make the indictment ridiculous; and, _apropos_ of the\r\nconcession to the rank and file, Dr. Coster even expressed doubts as\r\nto whether, if the hostile intention were eliminated, any crime could\r\nbe said to remain under the indictment. He however agreed to allow\r\nthe four leaders to qualify their plea by a statement in writing\r\nwhich they were to put in at the same time. He stated that he would\r\nhave _pro forma_ to put in some evidence of the offence, but\r\nundertook not to press for exemplary punishment, and moreover\r\npromised that he would not dispute or question the statement to be\r\nput in, provided that it contained no material error in fact.\r\n\r\nA discussion then followed as to the law under which the trial would\r\ntake place. Mr. Wessels urged that, as there was specific provision\r\nin the statute law for cases of this nature, the statute law would of\r\ncourse apply in preference to Roman-Dutch law. Dr. Coster said he\r\npresumed that this would be the case, but that he was not quite sure\r\nwhether Roman-Dutch law would not apply. He added however that\r\nanything he could say would not be binding upon the judge, who could\r\nalone decide as to the question of law.\r\n\r\nMr. Wessels's report to his clients induced the rank and file to\r\nagree under the altered circumstances to the third alternative,\r\nnamely, pleading guilty, and they agreed to this under the\r\nimpression, which without doubt had been suggested and deliberately\r\nfostered by the Government, that they were pleading guilty to a\r\nnominal offence, and would incur a monetary penalty in proportion.\r\n\r\nIn consultation with the leaders, Mr. Wessels reported the\r\ndiscussions with Dr. Coster as above given. Both he and Mr. Solomon\r\nrepresented to them the gravity of the plea, and said that there was\r\nthe possibility that the judge would invoke Roman-Dutch law and\r\nignore the laws of the country, in which case it would be in his\r\npower to pass sentence of death. In their opinion, they added, and in\r\nthe opinion of Mr. Rose Innes and others, this would be a monstrous\r\nstraining of the law, yet they felt bound to indicate the\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nThe course before the prisoners was not indeed an attractive one, but\r\nit was not without its recommendations. It would have been infinitely\r\npreferable to fight it out had there been a chance of a good fight,\r\nif even a losing one; but, apart from a verdict of guilty being an\r\nabsolute certainty, the circumstances were against any possibility of\r\neffecting anything like a strong impeachment of the Government.\r\nMoreover, the course now proposed would prevent any 'giving away' of\r\nDr. Jameson, who had yet to be tried, and of others; and it also\r\nremoved the necessity for individual defences by those among the\r\nprisoners who had been involved in a less degree than others. The\r\nmatter at that time appeared in one way to concern the leaders only.\r\nIf they were willing to take upon themselves the burden of the charge\r\nand secure the acquittal of others by accepting the full\r\nresponsibility, it could only be regarded as a chivalrous act. But\r\nthere were some among the other the prisoners--'Irreconcilables,'\r\nas they were called--who considered themselves equally responsible\r\nwith the leaders, who strongly objected to shifting any portion of\r\ntheir responsibility upon others, and who desired to stand with those\r\nwho were prepared to bear the brunt of the charge. To them the\r\nsuggestion to plead guilty was as gall and wormwood, and was regarded\r\nas another humiliation which they were required to endure, another\r\nclimbing-down similar to the disarmament, and attended, like it, with\r\nexasperating and baffling complications and involvements that made\r\nrefusal an impossibility. The one call to which these men would\r\nrespond was the call to stand together and have no divisions--a cause\r\nfor which they were still to make many sacrifices. The irony of it\r\nwas that in order to 'stand together' they had to agree to\r\nsegregation.\r\n\r\nDr. Coster would accept no further modification or variation of his\r\nterms--there was no option to individuals to plead not guilty and\r\nfight it out, except at the cost of involving all the others, nor was\r\nthere any option to them to plead with the leaders. One other factor\r\nin the determination of this policy remains to be noted. The\r\ncommunications already recorded as having passed between some of the\r\nmembers of the Reform Committee and Dr. Jameson, after the latter had\r\nactually invaded the country, and some evidence as to the\r\narrangements made for the reception and camping of his force, were in\r\nthe hands of the Government, and these were sufficient to convict\r\nevery member of the Reform Committee under count 2 of the indictment\r\nin a trial before a Boer jury and by a special judge. Conviction\r\nunder count 1 was assured by the letter of invitation and the\r\nadmissions in the 'privileged' meeting with the Government\r\nCommission. Conviction under count 2 would be a distinct aggravation\r\nof the position of the four--or so it seemed then--whilst it would be\r\na most serious thing for the rank and file; and it was finally\r\ndecided to plead in accordance with the suggestion of the State\r\nAttorney. The decision was conveyed to this gentleman and by him to\r\nthe President, who expressed his 'satisfaction' at a course which\r\nwould enable him to 'deal magnanimously with the prisoners,' no doubt\r\nin pursuance of the policy of 'Forget and Forgive.' When, as a\r\nconvincing proof of the wisdom of the decision to plead guilty,\r\nthe 'satisfaction' of the President was made known to the\r\nIrreconcilables, they remarked that this was the worst sign that\r\nthey had yet detected, but others were more hopeful.\r\n\r\nAs to the soundness of the advice on which the prisoners pleaded, it\r\nmay be observed that Messrs. Gregorowski and Coster have both since\r\nthen expressed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence to\r\nconvict one and all of high treason, and they should know what would\r\nhave been considered 'sufficient.' The latter added that the prime\r\nmovers were of course guilty; but they at any rate had tried to stop\r\nJameson, whilst those who joined the Reform Committee in the later\r\nstages were morally worse, since they had only joined when and\r\nbecause they knew that he had invaded the country. Mr. Gregorowski,\r\nat a later stage, defended his sentence on the leaders, but feared he\r\nhad been 'far too lenient with the others.' It would be unfair\r\ntherefore to suggest that the advice on which the prisoners had\r\ndecided to act was other than sound wise and proper in the\r\ncircumstances. That it should afterwards appear that the other\r\nparties to the arrangement had acted with deliberate duplicity and\r\nbad faith cannot be laid as a charge against the gentlemen who gave\r\nthis advice, and whose only fault, if fault it be, was that their\r\ninstincts, their principles, and their training precluded the\r\nsuspicion of treachery.\r\n\r\nThe trial commenced on April 24, when the prisoners were arraigned,\r\nafter which an adjournment was made until the 27th, in order to allow\r\nthree of the prisoners who were then travelling up to take their\r\ntrial to arrive. On the latter date, all being present, and pleas of\r\nguilty having been recorded, the State Attorney put in the cipher\r\ntelegrams, the minutes of the 'privileged' meeting between the\r\nGovernment Commission and the deputation of the Reform Committee,\r\nnone of which had been produced in evidence, and the record of\r\nevidence taken at the preliminary examination. Mr. Wessels then read\r\nand put in the following statement of the four leaders:\r\n\r\nFor a number of years endeavours have been made to obtain by\r\nconstitutional means the redress of the grievances under which the\r\nUitlander population labours. The new-comer asked for no more than is\r\nconceded to emigrants by all the other Governments in South\r\nAfrica, under which every man may, on reasonable conditions, become a\r\ncitizen of the State; whilst here alone a policy is pursued by which\r\nthe first settlers retain the exclusive right of government.\r\n\r\nPetitions supported by the signatures of some 40,000 men were\r\nignored; and when it was found that we could not get a fair and\r\nreasonable hearing, that provisions already deemed obnoxious and\r\nunfair were being made more stringent, and that we were being\r\ndebarred for ever from obtaining the rights which in other countries\r\nare freely granted, it was realized that we would never get redress\r\nuntil we should make a demonstration of force to support our claims.\r\n\r\nCertain provision was made regarding arms and ammunition, and a\r\nletter was written to Dr. Jameson, in which he was asked to come to\r\nour aid under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn December 26 the Uitlanders' Manifesto was published, and it was\r\nthen our intention to make a final appeal for redress at the public\r\nmeeting which was to have been held on January 6. In consequence of\r\nmatters that came to our knowledge we sent on December 26 Major Heany\r\n(by train via Kimberley), and Captain Holden across country, to\r\nforbid any movement on Dr. Jameson's part.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Monday, December 30, we learnt from Government\r\nsources that Dr. Jameson had crossed the frontier. We assumed that he\r\nhad come in good faith to help us, probably misled by some of the\r\nexaggerated rumours which were then in circulation. We were\r\nconvinced, however, that the Government and the burghers would not in\r\nthe excitement of the moment believe that we had not invited Dr.\r\nJameson in, and there was no course open to us but to prepare to\r\ndefend ourselves if we were attacked, and at the same time to spare\r\nno effort to effect a peaceful settlement.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary to form some organization for the protection of\r\nthe town and the maintenance of order; since, in the excitement\r\ncaused by the news of Dr. Jameson's coming, serious disturbances\r\nwould be likely to occur, and it was evident that the Government\r\norganization could not deal with the people without serious risks of\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Committee was formed on Monday night, December 30, and it\r\nwas intended to include such men of influence as cared to associate\r\nthemselves with the movement. The object with which it was formed is\r\nbest shown by its first notice, viz.:\r\n\r\n'Notice is hereby given that this Committee adheres to the National\r\nUnion Manifesto, and reiterates its desire to maintain the\r\nindependence of the Republic. The fact that rumours are in course of\r\ncirculation to the effect that a force has crossed the Bechuanaland\r\nborder renders it necessary to take active steps for the defence\r\nof Johannesburg and preservation of order. The Committee earnestly\r\ndesire that the inhabitants should refrain from taking any action\r\nwhich can be construed as an overt act of hostility against the\r\nGovernment. By order of the Committee,\r\n\r\n  'J. PERCY FITZPATRICK,\r\n  '_Secretary_.'\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken at the preliminary examination will show that\r\norder was maintained by this Committee during a time of intense\r\nexcitement, and through the action of the Committee no aggressive\r\nsteps whatever were taken against the Government, but on the\r\ncontrary, the property of the Government was protected, and its\r\nofficials were not interfered with.\r\n\r\nIt is our firm belief that had no such Committee been formed, the\r\nintense excitement caused by Dr. Jameson's entry would have brought\r\nabout utter chaos in Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged that we armed natives. This is absolutely untrue,\r\nand is disposed of by the fact that during the crisis upwards of\r\n20,000 white men applied to us for arms and were unable to get them.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning, December 31, we hoisted the flag of the Z.A.R.,\r\nand every man bound himself to maintain the independence of the\r\nRepublic. On the same day the Government withdrew its police\r\nvoluntarily from the town and we preserved perfect order.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of that day, Messrs. Marais and Malan presented\r\nthemselves as delegates from the Executive Council. They came (to use\r\ntheir own words) to 'offer us the olive branch,' and they told us\r\nthat if we would send a deputation to Pretoria to meet a Commission\r\nappointed by the Government, we should probably obtain 'practically\r\nall that we asked for in the Manifesto.'\r\n\r\nOur deputation met the Government Commission, consisting of Chief\r\nJustice Kotzé, Judge Ameshof, and Mr. Kock, member of the Executive.\r\n\r\nOn our behalf our deputation frankly avowed knowledge of Jameson's\r\npresence on the border, and of his intention, by written arrangement\r\nwith us, to assist us in case of extremity.\r\n\r\nWith the full knowledge of this arrangement, with the knowledge that\r\nwe were in arms and agitating for our rights, the Government\r\nCommission handed to us a resolution by the Executive Council, of\r\nwhich the following is the purport:\r\n\r\n'The High Commissioner has offered his services with a view to a\r\npeaceful settlement. The Government of the South African Republic has\r\naccepted his offer. Pending his arrival, no hostile step will be\r\ntaken against Johannesburg, provided Johannesburg takes no hostile\r\naction against the Government. In terms of a certain proclamation\r\nrecently issued by the President, the grievances will be earnestly\r\nconsidered.'\r\n\r\nWe acted in perfect good faith with the Government, believing it to\r\nbe their desire, as it was ours, to avert bloodshed, and believing it\r\nto be their intention to give us the redress which was implied in the\r\n'earnest consideration of grievances.'\r\n\r\nThere can be no better evidence of our earnest endeavour to repair\r\nwhat we regarded as a mistake on the part of Dr. Jameson than the\r\nfollowing offer which our deputation, authorized by resolution of the\r\nCommittee, laid before the Government Commission:\r\n\r\n'If the Government will permit Dr. Jameson to come into Johannesburg\r\nunmolested, the Committee will guarantee, with their persons if\r\nnecessary, that he will leave again peacefully as soon as possible.'\r\n\r\nWe faithfully carried out the agreement that we should commit no act\r\nof hostility against the Government; we ceased all active operations\r\nfor the defence of the town against any attack, and we did everything\r\nin our power to prevent any collision with the burghers--an attempt\r\nin which our efforts were happily successful.\r\n\r\nOn the telegraphic advice of the result of the interview of the\r\ndeputation with the Government Commission, we despatched Mr. Lace, a\r\nmember of our Committee, as an escort to the courier carrying the\r\nHigh Commissioner's despatch to Dr. Jameson, in order to assure\r\nourselves that the despatch would reach its destination.\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday, January 4, the High Commissioner arrived\r\nin Pretoria. On Monday, the sixth, the following telegram was sent to\r\nus:\r\n\r\n  'Pretoria, _January 6, 1896._\r\n\r\n'_From_ H.M.'s AGENT _to_ REFORM COMMITTEE, _Johannesburg._\r\n\r\n'_January 6._--I am directed to inform you that the High Commissioner\r\nmet the President, the Executive, and the Judges to-day. The President\r\nannounced the decision of the Government to be that Johannesburg must\r\nlay down its arms unconditionally as a [condition] precedent to a\r\ndiscussion and consideration of grievances. The High Commissioner\r\nendeavoured to obtain some indication of the steps which would be\r\ntaken in the event of disarmament, but without success, it being\r\nintimated that the Government had nothing more to say on this subject\r\nthan had already been embodied in the President's proclamation. The\r\nHigh Commissioner inquired whether any decision had been come to as\r\nregards the disposal of the prisoners, and received a reply in the\r\nnegative. The President said that as his burghers, to the number of\r\n8,000, had been collected and could not be asked to remain\r\nindefinitely, he must request a reply \"Yes\" or \"No\" to this ultimatum\r\nwithin twenty-four hours.'\r\n\r\nOn the following day Sir Jacobus de Wet, H.M.'s Agent, met us in\r\ncommittee, and handed to us the following wire from his Excellency\r\nthe High Commissioner:\r\n\r\n'HIGH COMMISSIONER, _Pretoria, to_ SIR J. DE WET, _Johannesburg._\r\n\r\n'_Received Johannesburg 7.36 a.m., January 7, 1896._\r\n\r\n'_Urgent_--You should inform the Johannesburg people that I consider\r\nthat if they lay down their arms they will be acting loyally and\r\nhonourably, and that if they do not comply with my request they\r\nforfeit all claim to sympathy from Her Majesty's Government, and from\r\nBritish subjects throughout the world, as the lives of Jameson and\r\nprisoners are practically in their hands.'\r\n\r\nOn this, and the assurance given in the Executive Council resolution,\r\nwe laid down our arms on January 6, 7, and 8; on the 9th we were\r\narrested, and have since been under arrest at Pretoria, a period of\r\nthree and a half months.\r\n\r\nWe admit responsibility for the action taken by us. We frankly avowed\r\nit at the time of the negotiations with the Government, when we were\r\ninformed that the services of the High Commissioner had been accepted\r\nwith a view to a peaceful settlement.\r\n\r\nWe submit that we kept faith in every detail in the arrangement with\r\nthe Government; that we did all that was humanly possible to protect\r\nboth the State and Dr. Jameson from the consequence of his action;\r\nthat we have committed no breach of the law which was not known to\r\nthe Government at the time that the earnest consideration of our\r\ngrievances was promised.\r\n\r\nWe can only now lay the bare facts before the Court, and submit to\r\nthe judgment that may be passed upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n            (Signed)       LIONEL PHILLIPS.\r\n                           FRANCIS RHODES.\r\n                           GEORGE FARRAR.\r\n\r\nPretoria, April 24, 1896.\r\n\r\nI entirely concur with the above statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n            (Signed)       JOHN HAYS HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nPretoria, April 27, 1896.\r\n\r\nAn incident which occurred during the reading of this statement\r\nenabled the prisoners to realize how poor would have been their\r\nchance of a fair trial before a Boer jury. On the right hand of the\r\njudge seats had been reserved for higher officials. Several members\r\nof the Executive were present in this quarter, and amongst them in a\r\nvery prominent position and facing the quarter reserved for the\r\nburghers sat Mr. Wolmarans, a member of the Executive Council. When\r\nMr. Wessels came to that portion of the statement referring to the\r\nnegotiations with the Executive Council, Mr. Wolmarans at first\r\nsmiled superciliously, then turned and addressed a remark to one of\r\nhis colleagues, shrugging his shoulder at the same time, and at the\r\nconclusion of the reference looked across the room to where the\r\njurymen sat, still smiling and shaking his head slowly and\r\ncontinuously for half a minute. To men accustomed to the decencies of\r\nBritish Courts of Justice this incident was rather revolting. When it\r\nis remembered that the Government refused to produce the minute\r\nreferred to, and that through their representatives they claimed\r\n'privilege' for the interview at which it was given, in order to\r\nabsolve themselves from appearing in Court, and that Mr. Wolmarans\r\nhimself sent the message to the Rand that the Government by the\r\nwithdrawal of its police gave practical evidence of holding out the\r\nolive-branch, his conduct appears the more unprincipled.\r\n\r\nThe State Attorney in a purely formal address, in consonance with his\r\npromise to Mr. Wessels not to seek exemplary punishment, asked for\r\npunishment according to law. Mr. Wessels in reply made an eloquent\r\nappeal on behalf of the accused and recited the circumstances which\r\nled to their seeking redress in the manner in which they did. He\r\nreferred to the negotiations with the Government, to the part played\r\nby the Reform Committee in the maintenance of order, to the fidelity\r\nwith which they had fulfilled their undertakings with the Government,\r\nand to their attitude towards Dr. Jameson. His references to the\r\nGovernment and to the existing abuses were made as judiciously as\r\npossible. He referred candidly to the relationship with Dr. Jameson,\r\nespecially alluding to the efforts made to protect him from the\r\nresults of his own action and to stand by him even at the cost of\r\npersonal sacrifice, and claimed that such action towards their former\r\ncolleague within the limits set by them did not necessarily imply\r\ntreason against the independence of the State, but should fairly\r\nentitle the prisoners to sympathy for their efforts to save a quondam\r\ncolleague, however wrong he might have been. On the point of law, Mr.\r\nWessels claimed that the Thirty-three Articles formed the basis of\r\nthe State's law, that there was specific provision for such cases as\r\nthis in those Articles, and that the punishment to be meted out to\r\nthe prisoners should be in accordance with these statutes, modified\r\nas the Court in its judgment might deem fit. No sooner had Mr.\r\nWessels resumed his seat than Dr. Coster, as was then thought,\r\nrepenting the fulfilment of his promise and casting off all disguise,\r\nor, as is more probable, carried away by an over-mastering excitement\r\nand strong personal and racial feeling and stimulated by\r\nconcentration upon one aspect only of the case, claimed the right to\r\naddress the Court again after the advocate for the defence had\r\nspoken. Dr. Coster has the reputation among those who know him of\r\nbeing a thoroughly honourable and straight-forward gentleman. As a\r\nHollander no doubt he felt deeply in a matter in which Hollanderism\r\nwas the _casus belli_; as public prosecutor it was his duty to\r\nprosecute, not to judge; and one prefers to think that in peculiar\r\nand trying circumstances he forgot the pledge he had given and\r\nremembered only the cause of his party. In a short but very violent\r\nspeech he depicted in the blackest terms the actions of the men\r\nagainst whom he had agreed not to seek exemplary punishment, and\r\npointing out the provisions of the Roman-Dutch law, claimed that the\r\nCourt should apply it in this case in preference to the statutes of\r\nthe country, and demanded from the Court the severest possible\r\npenalty which could be imposed under that law and under the\r\nThirty-three Articles and the Gold Law as well. With reference to the\r\nlast-named, Dr. Coster having mentioned the provision regarding the\r\nconfiscation of property, said that upon this point he would not\r\nspeak but would leave the matter to the judgment of the Court. The\r\nCourt was then adjourned until the morning of the 28th, ostensibly in\r\norder to enable the judge to consider the evidence and make up his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the prisoners, utterly unsuspicious of what lay\r\nbefore them, made all necessary arrangements to return to their homes\r\nand avocations upon the conclusion of the trial, believing that a\r\nnominal fine would be the penalty imposed. Many of them had taken\r\nreturn tickets from Johannesburg available for two days. The public\r\nthroughout the Transvaal and South Africa anticipated nothing more\r\nthan a nominal punishment upon the majority and a fine of a few\r\nthousand pounds upon the signatories to the letter of invitation.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners however were better informed. News had been\r\nobtained some days before the trial commenced that extra\r\naccommodation was being prepared in the gaol, avowedly to provide for\r\nthe Reformers. Two of the accused visited the gaol and verified this.\r\nOthers of the accused, few in number, were informed by personal\r\nfriends who had special means of getting information in Pretoria that\r\nimprisonment would be the lot of all and that the punishment on the\r\nleaders would be extremely severe; and they provided for this\r\ncontingency accordingly. The manager of the Government newspaper in\r\nPretoria informed two or three of those interested that the sentence\r\nof death would be passed upon the four leaders, as this had been\r\narranged; and men closely associated with the leaders themselves had\r\nbeen confidentially informed beforehand that it was the intention of\r\nthe Government to pass sentence of death, and that the matter was a\r\ncut-and-dried one. The information was given with a view to preparing\r\nthe prisoners for what awaited them.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the temporary Court-house (the Pretoria Market\r\nBuildings having been altered for this purpose) on the morning of the\r\nsentence, it was perfectly evident that some serious development was\r\nafoot. The town was thronged with mounted burghers, State artillery,\r\nand mounted and foot police. Every approach to the Court was guarded\r\nand the streets were patrolled. Most of the population of Pretoria\r\nwere gathered in the Market Square, endeavouring to gain admittance\r\nto the Court. The prisoners were arranged in their former places in a\r\nspecial quarter of the building railed off for the purpose, with the\r\nexception of Messrs. Phillips, Farrar, Rhodes and Hammond, who\r\nwere separated from the rest and placed in a special movable dock,\r\nwhich had been carried in over the heads of the people after the hour\r\nappointed for the sitting of the Court. The appearance of this dock\r\nwas recognized by all to be ominous, but some relief from the feeling\r\nof foreboding was experienced when Judge Gregorowski after taking his\r\nseat was observed to smile several times and to make some jocular\r\nremark to one of the officials of the Court. The faces of the\r\nofficials however damped any hopes that were built upon the judge's\r\ngenial appearance.\r\n\r\nMany of these gentlemen were personal and intimate friends of the\r\nprisoners: some were connected by closer ties; and one of the most\r\ntrying experiences for the prisoners was to witness the complete\r\nbreakdown of the minor officials employed in the carrying out of this\r\ntragic farce. The judge's first order was for the removal of all\r\nladies. The wives and relatives of many of the prisoners had been\r\nwarned by them beforehand of what was likely to happen and had\r\naccordingly absented themselves, but there were nevertheless a good\r\nnumber of ladies present. Judge Gregorowski then took the case in\r\nhand, passed in review the circumstances, and dealt with much of the\r\nevidence, including that taken at the preliminary examination and the\r\ndocuments put in by Government which had not yet been seen by the\r\nprisoners' advisers. He made no reference to the statement of the\r\nprincipal accused, subject to which their plea of guilty had been\r\nmade and accepted. He reviewed the law, and by a method of reasoning\r\nwhich has not commended itself to others he justified himself for\r\nsetting aside special statutes and applying the Roman-Dutch law\r\ninstead. In conclusion, he stated that he held the signatories of the\r\nletter to be directly responsible for the shedding of the burghers'\r\nblood at Doornkop, that he would therefore pass upon them the _only\r\npunishment possible_ under Roman-Dutch law--namely death, and that\r\nwhatever hope there might be in the merciful hearts of the Executive\r\nCouncil and in the President's great magnanimity, they should\r\nremember that in no other country would they have the slightest\r\ngrounds for hope. The usual question as to whether there were any\r\nreasons why sentence of death should not be passed upon them having\r\nbeen put and the usual reply in the negative having been received, in\r\nthe midst of silence that was only disturbed by the breaking down of\r\npersons in various parts of the hall--officials, burghers, and in the\r\ngeneral public--sentence of death was passed, first on Mr. Lionel\r\nPhillips, next on Colonel Rhodes, then on Mr. George Farrar, and\r\nlastly on Mr. Hammond. The bearing of the four men won for them\r\nuniversal sympathy and approval, especially under the conditions\r\nimmediately following the death sentence, when a most painful scene\r\ntook place in Court. Evidences of feeling came from all parts of the\r\nroom and from all classes of people: from those who conducted the\r\ndefence and from the Boers who were to have constituted the jury. The\r\ninterpreter translating the sentence broke down. Many of the minor\r\nofficials lost control of themselves, and feelings were further\r\nstrained by the incident of one man falling insensible.\r\n\r\nSentence was next passed upon the other prisoners. They were\r\ncondemned to suffer two years' imprisonment, to pay a fine of £2,000\r\neach, or as an alternative suffer another year's imprisonment, and\r\nthereafter to be banished from the State for a period of three years.\r\nIt was added that the question of confiscation of their property\r\nwould be one for the Executive to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe action of Mr. Gregorowski has been variously described, but at no\r\ntime more graphically than at the time of the sentence, when a\r\nsergeant of police who was guarding the prisoners exclaimed in the\r\npeculiar Dutch idiom: 'My God! he is like a dog: he has bitten and\r\nchewed and guzzled!'\r\n\r\nAfter passing the minor sentences the judge gave a short address to\r\nthe burghers, in which he thanked them for their attendance and made\r\nallusion with evident signs of satisfaction to the manner in which\r\nthe trial had been brought to a conclusion. A long delay followed\r\nduring which the judge proceeded to note his judgments. Once his\r\nattention was drawn by a remark of an official to which he replied\r\npromptly, at the same time breaking into a broad smile, but suddenly\r\nrecollecting the circumstances and the presence of the men sentenced\r\nto death, placed his hand over his mouth and wiped the smile away.\r\nThe incident was of course noticed by many people in Court and helped\r\nto strengthen the impression which a limited but sufficient\r\nexperience of Mr. Gregorowski had already created.\r\n\r\nIf the belief which now obtains, that the Reformers were enticed to\r\nplead guilty and misled as to the probable consequences of that plea,\r\nshould outlive personal feelings and leave a permanent mark in South\r\nAfrican history, it will be because it survives a searching test. In\r\nSouth Africa--as in many other countries--it is the invariable\r\npractice of the Courts to decline to accept the plea of guilty to a\r\ncapital charge. The prisoner is informed that as the plea involves\r\ncapital punishment it will not be accepted; and a formal trial and\r\nsufficient evidence of the crime are required by the Court. That is\r\ndone even in cases where the prisoner knows what the punishment will\r\nbe! In the case of the Reformers the State Attorney had, it is true,\r\ninformed Mr. Wessels that he would be obliged _pro forma_ to put in\r\ncertain evidence, but the reason was not given, and Mr. Wessels\r\nregarded it merely as the _quid pro quo_ for accepting unquestioned\r\nthe written statement of the four accused! Mr. Gregorowski in\r\ndefending his sentence has stated that under Roman-Dutch law he had\r\nno option but to pass sentence of death. Yet contrary to the custom\r\nwith which seventeen years' practice had made him familiar he\r\naccepted the plea of guilty--and accepted it without a word of\r\nexplanation or of warning! Is it surprising that people should want\r\nto know why?\r\n\r\nThe men were removed from Court under very heavy escort, the\r\ncondemned men being conveyed in a closed carriage and the rest of the\r\nprisoners being marched through the streets to the gaol, the whole\r\nparty moving at a foot pace. A little incident at the start did not\r\nfail to attract attention. The officer commanding a section of the\r\nguard having issued his orders in Dutch and some confusion having\r\nensued, the orders were repeated _in German_, with a satisfactory\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOne more incident--trifling perhaps in itself but leaving an\r\nineffaceable impression--occurred during the march to the gaol. As\r\nthe prisoners slowly approached the Government buildings, Dr. Leyds\r\naccompanied by one friend walked out until within a few yards of the\r\nprocession of sentenced men (a great proportion of whom were\r\npersonally well known to him) and stood there with his hands in his\r\npockets smiling at them as they went past. The action was so\r\nremarkable, the expression on the State Secretary's face so\r\nunmistakable, that the Dutch guards accompanying the prisoners\r\nexpressed their disgust. His triumph no doubt was considerable; but\r\nthe enjoyment must have been short-lived if the accounts given by\r\nother members of the Executive of his behaviour a month later are\r\nto be credited. The man who stood in safety and smiled in the faces\r\nof his victims was the same Dr. Leyds who within a month became\r\nseriously ill because some fiery and impetuous friend of the\r\nprisoners sent him an anonymous letter with a death's head and\r\ncross-bones; who as a result obtained from Government a guard over\r\nhis private house; and who thereafter proceeded about his duties in\r\nPretoria under armed escort.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the death sentence was commuted the same afternoon,\r\nbut no intimation of this was given to the prisoners and no public\r\nannouncement was made until twenty-four hours later. In spite of the\r\nvindictive urgings of the Hollander newspaper, the _Volksstem_, few\r\ncould believe that the death sentence would be carried out and most\r\npeople recognized that the ebullitions of that organ expressed the\r\nfeelings of only a few rabid and witless individuals among the\r\nHollanders themselves and were viewed with disgust by the great\r\nmajority of them. At the same time the scene in court had been such\r\nas to show that the Government party--the officials and Boers then\r\npresent--had not regarded the death sentence as a mere formality, but\r\nhad, on the contrary, viewed it as a deliberate and final judgment.\r\nIn such circumstances therefore it can be believed that the prisoners\r\nthemselves were not without misgivings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter VIII\r\n\r\n{33} Died in prison.\r\n\r\n{34} Unable, owing to illness, to stand trial\r\nwith the others. On recovery, Mr. Curtis returned to the Transvaal,\r\nand decided to plead 'not guilty,' whereupon proceedings were\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN GAOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Transvaal no distinction is made between ordinary criminals\r\nand those who in other countries are recognized as first-class\r\nmisdemeanants. Consequently the Reformers, without regard to the\r\nnature of their offence, their habits, health, age, or condition,\r\nwere handed over to the gaoler, Du Plessis, a relative of President\r\nKruger, to be dealt with at his kind discretion. For two days the\r\nprisoners existed on the ordinary prison fare. The majority being men\r\nin the early prime of life and in excellent health, suffered no ill\r\neffects, preferring to do with little or no food rather than touch\r\nthat which was doled out to them; but to the others it was a rather\r\nserious thing. There were several men between fifty and sixty years\r\nof age whose lives had been spent under favourable conditions. There\r\nwere some suffering from consumption, one from diabetes, one from\r\nfever, one from dysentery, and several others from less dangerous but\r\nsufficiently serious complaints. All alike were compelled to sleep\r\nupon the floor, with two thin blankets for protection. They were\r\nlocked in at 6 p.m., and allowed out at 6 a.m. Sanitary accommodation\r\nwas represented by the presence of a couple of buckets in the\r\nsleeping room. The air-space per man worked out at 145 cubic feet as\r\nagainst 900 feet prescribed by English prison regulations.\r\nVentilation was afforded on the one side by square holes cut in the\r\ncorrugated iron walls of the shed,{35} and on the other (the\r\nbuildings being lean-to's against the permanent prison buildings)\r\nby grated windows opening into the native cells. Needless to say,\r\nthese grated windows were originally intended to afford ventilation\r\nto the native cells, but the buildings to accommodate the Reformers\r\nhad been erected against the side-walls of the Kaffir quarters. The\r\nstench was indescribable. At 6 a.m. the prisoners were allowed out\r\ninto the yard, where they had the option of exercising throughout the\r\nday. The lavatories and bathing arrangements consisted of a tap in\r\nthe yard and an open furrow through which the town water ran, the\r\nlower end of which was used as a wash-place by prisoners, white and\r\nblack alike. Within a foot or two of the furrow where alone washing\r\nof the person or of clothing was allowed stood the gaol urinals.\r\nThere was neither adequate provision in this department nor any\r\nattempt at proper supervision, the result being that through\r\nirregularities, neglect, and defective arrangement the ground on both\r\nsides of the water-furrow for six or eight yards was horribly stained\r\nand saturated by leakage. Many of the prisoners could not approach\r\nthis quarter without being physically ill. Without further detail it\r\nmay be stated that there were at that time over 250 prisoners, about\r\n100 of whom were white. There were three closets and six buckets for\r\nthe accommodation of all, and removals took place sometimes once a\r\nday, sometimes once in every four days. Nothing but the horror of\r\nsuch conditions, and the fact that they prevail still in Pretoria\r\nGaol, and presumably in other gaols more removed from critical\r\nsupervision, could warrant allusions to such a disgusting state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nAt 6.15 breakfast was served. A number of tin dishes, containing one\r\npound of mealie-meal porridge (ground maize) each were placed in a\r\nrow on the ground in the yard in the same manner as a dog's food\r\nmight be set out. A bucket near by contained some coarse salt in the\r\ncondition in which it was collected in the natural salt pans, the\r\ncubes varying from the size of peas to the size of acorns. No sugar,\r\nmilk, tea, or coffee, was allowed. In order to utilize the salt the\r\nprisoners were obliged to crush it with rough stones on the cement\r\nsteps. Needless to say, but few partook of this food. To those who\r\nhad not tasted it before in the course of prospecting or up-country\r\ntravelling where conditions are sometimes very hard, it was no\r\nmore possible to swallow it than to eat sawdust.\r\n\r\nDinner was at twelve o'clock, and it consisted of coarse meat boiled\r\nto that degree which was calculated to qualify the water in which it\r\nwas boiled to be called soup, without depriving the meat of all title\r\nto be considered a separate dish. With this meal was also served half\r\na pound of bread. Supper, which was provided at five o'clock, was\r\nexactly the same as breakfast.\r\n\r\nTwo days of this fare told very severely upon those whose physical\r\ncondition was not of the best. By the third day several of the older\r\nmen and those in ill-health had broken down and were placed on\r\nhospital fare. Matters were sufficiently serious to induce the\r\nauthorities to allow gradual amelioration of the conditions, and by\r\ndegrees food of a better class was introduced. Mattresses and other\r\narticles of bedding were allowed, but stretchers although provided\r\nfor in the prison regulations were denied to the men until a few\r\nhours before their release a month later, when the prisoners were\r\npermitted by the gaoler to purchase them, no doubt with an eye to\r\nreversion to him in the course of a few hours. From time to time the\r\nregulations as to food were varied at the whim of the gaoler. On one\r\nday only cooked food would be allowed in; on another only raw food;\r\non a third nothing but tinned stuff; on a fourth all was turned back\r\nat the gates with the exception of that obtained by a few individuals\r\nat a heavy premium.\r\n\r\nA day or two after the passing of sentence representations were made\r\nto the prisoners, excluding the four death-sentence men, that it\r\nwould be advisable to appeal to the clemency of the Government for\r\nsome mitigation. In that case, it was stated, there was every reason\r\nto believe that the sentence of imprisonment would be entirely\r\nremitted and that the sentence of banishment would also be commuted.\r\nThe individuals from whom this suggestion first came were of the\r\nclass which habitually trades between the Government and the\r\npublic--the gentlemen of the backstairs. For this reason some of the\r\nprisoners gave considerable credence to the reports, whilst others\r\nfor the very same reason would have nothing whatever to do with them.\r\nHence arose a condition of things very like a deadlock among the\r\nprisoners themselves. It was represented by these agents that it\r\nwould be worse than useless for some of the prisoners to petition if\r\nmany others refused to do so and stood out. Some of the prisoners did\r\nactually petition--a course of action which was strongly condemned by\r\nothers; but it should be borne in mind that there were among the\r\nprisoners many men who were in bad health and poor circumstances, who\r\nhad heavy responsibilities in private life, and who were not only\r\nunable to pay their fines, but even unable to make any provision for\r\ntheir families during incarceration. Such conditions would tend to\r\nshake the nerve of most men.\r\n\r\nWith this nucleus to work upon the Government through their agents\r\nbegan a system of terrorism by which they hoped to establish\r\nconditions under which their 'magnanimity by inches' would appear in\r\nthe most favourable possible light. The first petition presented for\r\nthe signature of the prisoners was one in which they were asked to\r\nadmit the justice of their sentences, to express regret for what they\r\nhad done and to promise to behave themselves in the future. The\r\ndocument closed with an obsequious and humiliating appeal to the\r\n'proved magnanimity of the Government.' The reception accorded to\r\nthis was distinctly unfavourable, copies of the petitions being in\r\nsome instances torn up and flung in the faces of those who presented\r\nthem. The great majority of the prisoners refused to have anything to\r\ndo with them, and on representing the view that any appeal so couched\r\nwas not consistent with their self-respect, they were informed that\r\nthe petition had already been shown to the President and members of\r\nthe Executive Council and had been approved by them and that it would\r\nnot look well to alter it now.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made for some days to induce the prisoners to sign\r\nthis document, but they refused. A certain number of the men were\r\nopposed to signing anything whatever, even the most formal appeal to\r\nthe Executive Council for a revision of sentence. They based their\r\nrefusal upon two reasons: 1st, that they had been arrested by an act\r\nof treachery and tried by a packed Court, and if the Executive\r\nrecognized the injustice of the sentence they might act\r\nspontaneously without petition from the prisoners; 2nd, that they\r\nbelieved that any document however moderate which they might sign\r\nwould only be the thin end of the wedge by which the Government hoped\r\nto introduce the principle of individual statements and pleas--that\r\nis to say each one to excuse himself at the expense of his neighbour,\r\nand thus enable the authorities to establish by the prisoners' own\r\nconfessions the extent of the guilt and complicity which they had\r\nbeen unable to prove.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions an appeal was made to Messrs. Rose Innes, Q.C.,\r\nand Solomon, Q.C. These gentlemen had remained in Pretoria and\r\ndevoted their time and energies to obtaining some amelioration of the\r\nconditions of imprisonment and some mitigation of the sentences\r\nimposed upon the Reformers. The petition as presented by the\r\nGovernment was shown to Mr. Innes, who indignantly rejected the\r\nsuggestion of signing any such document. As the strongest reason\r\nadduced in favour of signing petitions was the statement that\r\naccording to law and custom it was impossible for the Government to\r\ntake cognizance of the prisoners' case even with every desire to\r\nmitigate the punishment unless it was brought before them by direct\r\nappeal, Mr. Innes undertook to see the President and Chief-Justice\r\nKotzé on the subject. By this time further suggestions had been made\r\non the subject of petitions, and the prisoners were being urged among\r\nother things to name in plain terms the extent and manner in which\r\nthey would like their sentences commuted. This proposal was regarded\r\nas a preposterous and ridiculous one; but nothing is too ridiculous\r\nfor Pretoria and it was necessary to deal seriously with it.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, Mr. Rose Innes interviewed the Chief Justice,\r\nin order to get the highest authority in the country as a guide. Mr.\r\nKotzé would not at first express an opinion as to whether petitions\r\nshould be sent in, but he was evidently inclined to recommend them as\r\npolitic, 'But,' said Mr. Innes, 'it is not a question of policy; it\r\nis a matter of law. Is there anything in the law which renders it\r\nnecessary for a prisoner to petition before his sentence may be\r\nrevised by the Executive--anything which debars the Executive from\r\ndealing with his case if he does not petition?' Mr. Kotzé's answer\r\nwas clear: 'No, certainly not--nothing whatever!'\r\n\r\nIn the interview with the President which took place immediately\r\nafter this Mr. Innes was brusquely informed that petitions from the\r\nprisoners were of no value, and would receive no consideration; that\r\nthe President did not want any of their petitions; and that he was\r\nguided solely by his burghers, who had already petitioned in the\r\nmatter. 'I would pay more heed,' said Mr. Kruger, 'to a petition from\r\nfifty of my burghers than to one from the whole of Johannesburg.' At\r\nthe conclusion of an unpleasant interview, which called for all the\r\ntact and good temper at the command of the gentleman who was\r\ninteresting himself on behalf of the prisoners, the President added\r\nin an offhand manner, 'The petitions can do no harm and might\r\nstrengthen my hands in dealing with the rest of the Executive; so\r\nthey can send them in if they like.'\r\n\r\nWith this answer Messrs. Innes and Solomon returned to the gaol, and\r\nafter informing the prisoners of what had taken place advised them,\r\nunder the circumstances, to make a formal but respectful appeal for a\r\nrevision of the sentences. It was their opinion, based upon the\r\ninformation which they had at great pains gathered, and it was also\r\nthe opinion of the Chief Justice, that no petition was necessary, and\r\nthat the sentences would be brought under the consideration of the\r\nExecutive by the memorials of the burghers; but they considered that\r\nas interested persons or indiscreet friends had already suggested the\r\nidea of petitions, and as a refusal now to sign anything might have a\r\nvery unfavourable effect upon persons with the disposition and\r\ncharacter of those with whom they had to deal, it would be advisable\r\nto make an appeal so worded as to formally comply with the\r\nrequirements of the extreme party in the Executive; one which would\r\nsatisfy those of the prisoners who were in favour of appealing, and\r\nwould not be offensive to those who were against petitions at any\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe strongest reason for urging this was to preserve unanimity of\r\naction among the prisoners. The course was in fact a compromise\r\ndesigned to satisfy those who considered a petition of some sort to\r\nbe necessary, and those who would not as they expressed it\r\n'sacrifice their self-respect' by asking for anything from the\r\npeople who had treated them in what they deemed to be a dishonest\r\nand treacherous manner.\r\n\r\nAll the prisoners except Messrs. A. Woolls-Sampson and W.D. (Karri)\r\nDavies agreed to this: many did so much against their own wishes\r\nbecause of the appeal to stand together, and because it was strongly\r\nurged that their obstinacy would affect not only themselves but would\r\nprevent the liberation of others whose circumstances were almost\r\ndesperate. They yielded--it is true--but remained unconvinced. To\r\nMessrs. Sampson and Davies the answers of the Chief Justice and the\r\nPresident are now of considerable importance, since the reason given\r\nfor their detention involves the repudiation of the assurances given\r\nby the President and Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThose who had not signed any other form of appeal now made a formal\r\napplication to have their sentences brought into review by the\r\nExecutive Council. They stated then their belief that it was only the\r\nbeginning of the petition business that it would be wholly\r\nineffective and that it was to be understood that they would sign no\r\nmore under any circumstances. This application was deemed by the\r\nemissaries of the Government to be sufficient to comply with the\r\nrequirements, and promises were conveyed to the prisoners that the\r\nsentences would be at once taken into consideration and commutations\r\nannounced. In the course of a day or two however further demands were\r\nmade, and the prisoners were informed that they would be dressed in\r\nprison garb under severer regulations specially passed for them\r\nunless they at once petitioned against this course.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Innes represented their case to the Government at the\r\ndictate of his own feelings of humanity, and not prompted thereto by\r\nthe prisoners themselves, most of whom would have been glad to see\r\nthe Government wreak their vengeance in petty and vindictive\r\nprovisions. The proposed alterations were however abandoned without\r\nprotest from the prisoners after the supply of convict garb had been\r\nsent up to the gaol. So matters went on day by day, each day bringing\r\nits fresh instalment of threats promises and cajoleries, each\r\nmorning its batch of disappointments. It was at first difficult to\r\nsay what object the Government had in view in endeavouring to compel\r\nthe Reformers to sign petitions, unless it were the unworthy one of\r\ndesiring to humiliate men who were already down, or the perhaps\r\nmore contemptible one of forcing them to turn informers by a process\r\nof self-excusing and thus enable them to differentiate in the\r\ncommutations. The fact remained that repeated efforts were made and\r\npressure brought to bear upon the men to induce them to sign. One\r\npretext after another was used. Finally the naked truth came out: the\r\nGovernment required each man to state in an individual declaration\r\nthe extent of his guilt the extenuating facts and the circumstances\r\nunder which he became associated with the Reform movement. This was\r\nexactly what had been foretold by men who understood Boer methods.\r\n\r\nThe means resorted to by the gaol officials to enforce this\r\npetition-signing were characteristic. The gaoler (Du Plessis) is one\r\nof the most unfavourable specimens of his race. Unscrupulous and\r\nbrutal in his methods, untrustworthy as to his undertakings, and\r\nviolent and uncertain in his temper, he singled out those among the\r\nprisoners whom he considered to be the leaders of the 'stiff-necked'\r\nparty as he termed it, and treated them with as much severity as he\r\ncould. These men found themselves unable to obtain those facilities\r\nwhich were regarded as the right of all the prisoners. Upon occasion\r\ntheir food was stopped at the gates, and visitors--their wives and\r\nfamilies--were refused admission, although provided with permits from\r\nthe proper authorities and complying with the gaol regulations; and\r\non more than one occasion he informed individual members of this\r\nparty that the 'petitions would have to be signed,' that they would\r\nhave to 'go down on their knees to the Government,' otherwise they\r\nwould 'rot in gaol.' All this undisguised eagerness to obtain the\r\nsignatures naturally only strengthened the resolution of the men who\r\nstood out. They had already against their wishes and judgment signed\r\none application, and more than that they refused to do. When it was\r\nfound to be impossible to induce the men to inform against each\r\nother, some modification was made in the demands of the\r\npetition-hunters and some prisoners were asked and induced to make\r\nstatements concerning their own part in the late movement, making no\r\nallusion to the part played by others, and, for reasons which it is\r\nimpossible to divine unless it was designed to lead to something\r\nmore, this was regarded by the Government as a desirable step.\r\n\r\nThe suspense and disappointment added to the original sentence upon a\r\nman who was never even mentioned in evidence and who took no part in\r\nthe Reform movement, beyond associating himself with the\r\norganizations for the protection of property in Johannesburg, told so\r\nseverely upon one of the prisoners that his mind became unhinged, and\r\nin the course of the following period he developed marked signs of\r\nhomicidal and suicidal mania. His condition was so serious that\r\nstrong representations were made to all the officials connected with\r\nthe gaol--the gaoler himself, the district surgeon, the commissioner\r\nof police, and the landdrost of Pretoria. The prisoners themselves\r\norganized a system of guards or watches over their comrade, pending\r\nthe result of their representations to the officials. On the fourth\r\nday however the unfortunate man, driven out of his mind by the\r\nconstant and cruel disappointment of purposely raised hopes, eluding\r\nthe watchfulness of his friends took his own life.\r\n\r\nThe news of this event was received with horror throughout South\r\nAfrica, the more so as for some days previously the newspapers had\r\nhinted at some such impending catastrophe. In the course of the\r\ninquiry which was held evidence was given showing that the gaol\r\nsurgeon had reported the state of affairs to the proper authorities\r\nsome days before, but in a formal and half-hearted way. Evidence\r\nhowever was forthcoming that four of the prisoners (themselves\r\nmedical men) had forcibly represented the extreme seriousness of the\r\ncase to the gaoler, the gaol surgeon and the landdrost of Pretoria,\r\nand had induced the assistant-gaoler and warders to support their\r\nrepresentations, but all without avail. The result of the inquiry was\r\nto lay partial blame upon the doctor and to acquit everybody else--a\r\nresult which the public have been used to expect in the Transvaal. It\r\nis somewhat difficult to see how the decision was arrived at, seeing\r\nthat in the offices there was the record of a special pass granted\r\nto the unfortunate man's wife to visit him and remain with him for a\r\nconsiderable period on the previous day in order to cheer him up\r\nand avert serious consequences. The incident told severely upon the\r\nnerves of those who were not themselves in the best of health, and\r\nit was found necessary immediately to release or remove others among\r\nthe prisoners for fear of similar results.\r\n\r\nThe Government seemed to realize that it was incumbent upon them to\r\ndo something in order to allay the feeling of indignation which was\r\nbeing roused throughout South Africa at their manner of treating the\r\nprisoners, so a further instalment of magnanimity was decided upon.\r\nOn the day of the unfortunate affair the manager of the Government\r\nnewspaper, _The Press_, was authorized by President Kruger and other\r\nmembers of the Executive to inform the prisoners that they would have\r\nto make modified personal statements of the nature previously\r\nindicated, and if these petitions were presented to the Executive\r\nCouncil by 8 a.m. on the following Monday (the prisoners would then\r\nhave been three weeks in gaol) orders for their release would be\r\nissued by Monday night. In order to secure a favourable reception of\r\nthis suggestion it was arranged that the clergyman who was to conduct\r\nDivine service on Sunday in the gaol would deliver this message from\r\nthe President to the prisoners at the conclusion of the service, and\r\nurge the men for their own sakes and for the sake of their families\r\nand of their friends to abandon the position which they had taken up\r\nand to sign declarations of the nature required, and so secure their\r\nrelease. Nor was this all. Outside the gaol the wives of those men\r\nwho stood out against the petition movement were informed by\r\nGovernment officials that unless the demands of the Government were\r\ncomplied with by their husbands they would serve the full period of\r\ntheir sentence. Pressure was brought to bear upon these ladies and\r\nspecial facilities were given them to visit the gaol, avowedly in\r\norder to bring about the desired end.\r\n\r\nEleven of the prisoners--apart from the four whose punishment in\r\nsubstitution for death had not been decided upon, and who were\r\ntherefore not concerned in the petitions--declined to reconsider\r\ntheir decision, and elected rather to serve their term of two years;\r\nand they expressed the conviction at the same time that these\r\npromises of the President would not be kept any more than others\r\nhad been. The result justified their judgment. After a postponement\r\nof two days on some flimsy pretext the official intimation of the\r\ncommutations was given to the prisoners on Wednesday, May 20. Instead\r\nof the release positively and definitely promised the term of\r\nimprisonment was reduced in the following degree: Ten men were\r\nreleased, twenty-four men were condemned to three months', eighteen\r\nto five months', and four to one year's imprisonment; and the\r\nclemency of the Government towards the four leaders was indicated by\r\na sentence of fifteen years each.\r\n\r\nEven a short period of imprisonment under the existing conditions\r\nmeant certain death to a proportion of the men sentenced, and it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that the 'magnanimity' displayed by the\r\nGovernment after the disappointments and delays seriously affected\r\nthe health of a number of the men, following as it did closely upon\r\nthe tragic affair already alluded to.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Messrs. Sampson and Davies no decision was announced,\r\nit being intimated by Dr. Leyds that, as they had made no petition,\r\ntheir case had not been brought before the Government, and the\r\nExecutive had therefore no official knowledge of their existence. But\r\nthe extent of the Government's magnanimity was even then not fully\r\nknown. On the following day it was announced to the prisoners that\r\nthey had been misinformed with regard to the five and twelve months'\r\ncommutations--that the intention and resolution of the Executive was\r\nmerely to grant these men permission to appeal at the end of the\r\nperiods named to the aforesaid magnanimity.\r\n\r\nSome prominence has been given to the cases of those prisoners who\r\nwere unable for physical or other special reasons to withstand the\r\nstrain; and it should therefore be made equally clear that in many\r\ncases the men regarded with contemptuous amusement the cat and mouse\r\npolicy and the stage-managed magnanimity displayed towards them. They\r\nwere perfectly well able and willing to endure the sentence passed\r\nupon them, and they were not misled by Boer promises in which they\r\nhad never had any faith at all. There are good reasons to be assigned\r\nfor the willingness of many of the men to make appeals to the\r\nGovernment: sheer hard necessity and the sufferings of those\r\ndependent upon them were among these reasons; and it is unfair to\r\nconsider these appeals to have been due to loss of nerve.\r\n\r\nThere were among the prisoners twenty-three Englishmen, sixteen South\r\nAfricans, nine Scotchmen, six Americans, two Welshmen, one Irishman,\r\none Australian, one Hollander, one Bavarian, one German, one\r\nCanadian, one Swiss, and one Turk. This variety of nationalities\r\nshould receive due consideration when questions such as for instance\r\nthat of the flag are considered. In this matter of petitions it was\r\nnot to be expected that men whose associations with the country had\r\nbeen limited to a few years should experience the same depth of\r\nfeeling and bitterness of resentment as the South Africans born who\r\nlook upon the country as their native land and who view with keen\r\nresentment the attitude of the Boers towards them in the Transvaal,\r\nso much at variance with their attitude towards the Boers in the\r\nneighbouring colonies. Nothing could illustrate this difference in\r\nfeeling better than the fact that of the eleven men who throughout\r\ndeclined to sign petitions eight were South African born, one\r\nAustralian, one English, and one Scotch. There is nothing\r\ndiscreditable to others in these figures; they simply indicate the\r\ndifference of feeling which did and indeed naturally must exist. The\r\nSouth African born men consider themselves to have been robbed of a\r\nportion of their birthright; the others have not the same reason for\r\nthinking this.\r\n\r\nWith men of so many nationalities the position of the British\r\nResident would in any case have been one of difficulty, especially\r\nafter the part played by the High Commissioner. In the case of Sir\r\nJacobus de Wet very little satisfaction was given. What caused the\r\nmost comment and annoyance among the prisoners was that official\r\nrepresentatives of other countries appeared to have unusual\r\nfacilities offered them to visit the subjects of their Government--at\r\nleast, they could command the ordinary courtesies--whereas in the\r\ncase of the British Agent nothing of this sort existed. Frequently he\r\nwas observed standing outside the gaol in the worst of weather\r\nwithout shelter, patiently waiting until the gaoler would deem fit to\r\nsee him. In the meantime that official would stroll through the yard,\r\nmaking remarks to his subordinates indicative of the satisfaction he\r\nexperienced in keeping the representative of Her Majesty outside in\r\nthe rain and mud. Upon occasions when he was afforded admission he\r\nwas hustled through the yard by a warder and not allowed to hold\r\nprivate conversation with any of the prisoners. On several occasions\r\nhe complained that he was refused admission by order of the gaoler,\r\nand the spectacle of England's representative being turned away by an\r\nignorant and ill-conditioned official like Du Plessis was not an\r\nedifying one. It is only necessary to say that upon an occasion when\r\nDu Plessis adopted the same tactics towards the Portuguese Consul\r\nthat gentleman proceeded at once to the Presidency and demanded as\r\nhis right free admission to the gaol whenever he chose to go, and the\r\nright was promptly recognized although there was no subject of his\r\nGovernment at the time within the precincts. Indeed the Portuguese\r\nConsul stated openly that he called for the purpose of visiting as a\r\nfriend one of the Reform prisoners, giving the name of one of the\r\nrecalcitrants most objectionable to the Government. The American\r\nConsul too carried matters with a high hand on the occasion of his\r\nvisit to Pretoria, and it seemed as though the Paramount Power was\r\nthe only one which the Transvaal Government could afford or cared to\r\ntreat with contempt.\r\n\r\nThe period of gaol life afforded the Reformers some opportunity of\r\nstudying a department of the Transvaal Administration which they had\r\nnot before realized to be so badly in need of reform. The system--if\r\nsystem it can be called--upon which the gaol was conducted may be\r\ngathered from the gaoler's own words. When one of the prisoners had\r\ninquired of him whether a certain treatment to which a white convict\r\nhad been subjected was in accordance with the rules of the gaol and\r\nhad received an answer in the affirmative, he remarked that he did\r\nnot think many of the Reformers could exist under such conditions. Du\r\nPlessis replied: 'Oh no! Not one of you would be alive a month\r\nif the rules were enforced. No white man could stand them. Indeed,'\r\nhe added, 'if the rules were _properly_ enforced, not even a nigger\r\ncould stand them!'\r\n\r\nSome subsequent experience of gaol-life induced the Reformers to\r\naccept this view as tolerably correct. It is known for instance that\r\nafter the Malaboch war sixty-four of the tribe were incarcerated in\r\nPretoria Gaol. Some twenty were subsequently released, but of the\r\nremainder twenty-six died within the year. Bad food vile sanitary\r\narrangements and want of clothing and shelter contributed to this\r\nend. Malaboch was a petty chief against whom an expedition was\r\norganized, ostensibly because he had refused to pay his taxes. The\r\nexpedition is chiefly notorious on account of the commandeering of\r\nBritish subjects which led to the visit of Sir Henry Loch already\r\ndescribed. It resulted--as these expeditions inevitably do--in the\r\nworsting of the natives, the capture of the chief and his headmen,\r\nand the parcelling out of his tribe as indentured servants among the\r\nBoers.\r\n\r\nConsiderable sympathy was felt with Malaboch among the Uitlanders,\r\nnot because of his refusal to pay taxes but because the opinion\r\nprevailed that this refusal was due only to the tyrannical and\r\nimproper conduct of the Boer native commissioners; and a number of\r\nJohannesburg men resolved in the interests of the native and also of\r\nthe native labour supply on the Rand to have the matter cleared up at\r\nthe forthcoming trial of the chief. Funds were provided and counsel\r\nemployed, nominally to defend Malaboch, but really to impeach the\r\nnative commissioners, who in many cases were and continue to be a\r\nperfect curse to the country. No sooner had this intended course of\r\naction become known than the Government decided to treat their\r\nprisoners under the provisions of martial law--to treat them, in\r\nfact, as prisoners of war, who were liable to be indefinitely\r\ndetained without further trial. Under these conditions they were\r\nplaced in the Pretoria Gaol, and with the exception of a few\r\nsubordinates there they have lived--or died--since. The offences of\r\nthese natives, for all anyone knows, may have been similar to those\r\nof Langalibalele, Dinizulu, Secocoeni, Cetewayo, and other native\r\nchiefs whom the British Government have also disposed of without\r\ntrial. But it is urged that these men are entitled to a trial,\r\nbecause it is well known that the provocation under which they\r\ncommitted their offences against the law--if indeed any were\r\ncommitted--was such as, in the minds of most people, would justify\r\ntheir action.{36}\r\n\r\nThe position of a native in the Pretoria Gaol is indeed an unhappy\r\none. Sleeping accommodation--that is to say, shed accommodation--is\r\nprovided for about one-quarter of the number confined there. During\r\nfine weather it is no hardship upon the natives to sleep in the open\r\nyard provided that they have some covering. The blankets doled out to\r\nthem are however in many cases such as one would not allow to remain\r\nin one's kennels; and in wet or cold weather (and the fact is that\r\nduring at least one quarter of the year the nights are cold, whilst\r\nduring the five months' wet season rain may fall at any time) the\r\nsufferings of these unfortunates many of whom have no blankets at all\r\nare very severe. Of course the stronger fight their way into the\r\nshed, and even fill the little covered passage-way; the others crouch\r\nor lie about in the open yard like wild beasts without a vestige of\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the native political prisoners representations were made\r\nby the gaol doctor that they were dying in numbers from scurvy and\r\nfever, for want of vegetable food. A special effort on his part\r\nsecured for a few days some allowance of this nature, but the matter\r\nhaving been brought to the notice of General Joubert, the\r\nSuperintendent-General of natives, peremptory orders were issued to\r\ndiscontinue this; and this although the wretched creatures might have\r\nbeen sufficiently supplied from the gardens attached to the gaol\r\nwhich are cultivated by the prisoners, and the product of which was\r\nused by the gaoler to feed his pigs. For a little while longer the\r\ndoctor continued the vegetable diet at his own expense, but being\r\nunable to afford this it was discontinued and the former death-rate\r\nwas resumed.\r\n\r\nFloggings are quite common. In many instances white men have been\r\nflogged there. It is not intended to suggest that this should not\r\nhave been done, but cases occurred in the Pretoria Gaol which are\r\nsurely difficult to justify. Du Plessis stated to the Reform\r\nprisoners that he had with the sanction of the Landdrost inflicted\r\nupon one prisoner named Thompson, who was undoubtedly refractory and\r\ndisobedient, _upwards of eighty lashes within three weeks._ He added\r\nthat this was as good as a death-sentence, because neither white nor\r\nblack could stand two inflictions of twenty-five lashes, as they were\r\ngiven in Pretoria Gaol, without permanent injury to the constitution.\r\nThe effect, he observed, of this severe punishment upon the back was\r\nto cause the blood to rush and settle on the lungs, and in every case\r\nit resulted in fatal lung mischief.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of imprisonment the Reformers witnessed a\r\nconsiderable number of floggings. These when inflicted by the\r\nassistant-gaoler or warders were usually marked by some kind of\r\nmoderation and consideration for the prisoner's physical condition,\r\nand some regard for official decencies. The same cannot be said of\r\nthose in which Du Plessis himself took a prominent part. Upon one\r\noccasion when a native had been released from the triangle, after\r\ntwenty strokes from the cat had been borne without a murmur, Du\r\nPlessis suddenly became infuriated at the stoicism of his victim, and\r\nstepping towards him knocked the released man down with his fist and\r\nspurned him with his foot. Upon another occasion a boy of ten or\r\ntwelve years of age (under what circumstances is not known) was taken\r\nby Du Plessis into the open yard, stretched in mid air by two warders\r\ngripping his wrists and ankles, and flogged with a cane by Du Plessis\r\nhimself. The screams of the child were heart-rending and the sight\r\ncaused one lady who happened to be visiting in the gaol to faint.\r\nWhen the wretched urchin was released by the two warders and stood\r\ncowering before Du Plessis the latter repeated his former performance\r\nof knocking his victim down with his closed fist.\r\n\r\nMr. Du Plessis it should be remembered is a sample of a certain class\r\nonly of the Boers--not by any means of all. He is a man with a\r\ntreacherous and vindictive temper, distinctly unpleasant in\r\nappearance, being coarsely and powerfully built, and enjoying an\r\nexpression of countenance which varies between cunning and\r\ninsincerity on one hand and undisguised malevolence on the other.\r\nSome idea of the general kindliness of his disposition may be\r\ngathered from his actions. On one occasion, when special\r\nrelaxation of the rules was authorized by the Landdrost of Pretoria\r\nin order to enable a number of the Johannesburg friends of the\r\nprisoners to see them, and when about one hundred permits had been\r\nissued by that official to men travelling over from Johannesburg\r\nspecially for the purpose, Du Plessis devised means to defeat this\r\nact of consideration, and issued orders to his guards to admit only\r\nthree visitors at a time to the gaol. As a consequence, more than\r\nhalf failed to gain admittance. Nor was he satisfied with this; he\r\ninformed the prisoners themselves that he wished the Landdrost had\r\nissued two hundred passes instead of one hundred, so that he might\r\nlet those Johannesburg people know who was 'baas' there. Possibly the\r\nfact that on the previous day he had been severely rebuffed in his\r\npetition campaign may have provoked this act of retaliation.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of Mr. Du Plessis' system was afforded by the case\r\nof an old schoolmaster, an Englishman named Grant. He had been a\r\nteacher upon the farm of a Boer near Pretoria. Through some\r\ndifference with his employer he was dismissed; and his own version of\r\nthe affair indicates that he suffered considerable injustice. From\r\nthe evidence given in the case in which he subsequently figured it\r\nappeared that in order to urge his grievance he returned to the\r\nBoer's farm and even re-entered the house which he had formerly\r\noccupied. He was arrested and charged with trespass, or threatening\r\nto molest his late employer and members of his family, and was bound\r\nover to keep the peace for six months and to find £50 surety for the\r\nsame, failing which he should go to gaol for that period. This seemed\r\nto be rather a harsh sentence to pass upon a man who was over fifty\r\nyears of age, entirely destitute of means, of very inferior physique,\r\nand who had been charged at the instance of an individual who could\r\ncertainly have protected himself against five such men as Grant. No\r\ndoubt the accused was an eccentric man, and probably a nuisance,\r\nand it is even possible that his conduct left the magistrate no\r\nalternative but to pass the sentence which he did: it is not intended\r\nto question the justice of this part of the affair. Having been\r\nsent to gaol, however, because he could not deposit £50, Grant was\r\ntreated as the commonest malefactor in all respects but one--he was\r\nallowed to retain his own clothing. The unfortunate old man made a\r\npathetic picture with his seedy clothes, tail coat, tall white hat,\r\nand worn gloves, which he punctiliously wore whenever called upon to\r\nface the authorities--and it happened rather frequently. He objected\r\nto being classed and herded with the thieves and murderers and others\r\nwhose crimes were even more repulsive. He protested against the class\r\nof food that was served to him. For these remonstrances he at first\r\nreceived solitary confinement and even poorer diet; and later with a\r\nbrutality which one can surely only find in a Du Plessis the\r\nunfortunate old man was placed in the Kaffir stocks, thrown out in\r\nthe middle of the yard that he might be humiliated in the sight of\r\nall, and kept there in the fierce heat of a tropical sun for half a\r\nday. The sole excuse for this was that he had been unruly in\r\nprotesting against the treatment which he was receiving. The\r\nspectacle excited the pity of the Reform prisoners to such an extent\r\nthat even with the certainty of an insulting rebuff from the gaoler\r\nthey endeavoured to represent the man's case so as to have him\r\nreleased, but without success. It need only be added that the\r\nunfortunate man did not serve his entire term, the first act of the\r\nfirst released Reformers being to pay up the surety required and\r\nprovide him with funds to leave the country. Grant may have been as\r\nguilty and offensive as eccentricity can make a man, but nothing can\r\njustify the manner in which he was treated.\r\n\r\nThe stocks in the hands of Du Plessis were not the mild corrective\r\ninstrument which they are sometimes considered to be. According to\r\nthis authority the stocks can be made to inflict various degrees of\r\npunishment. Du Plessis states that when he took over the gaol he\r\nfound that the custom was to place men in the stocks within a cell\r\nand to trust to the irksomeness of the position and the solitary\r\nconfinement to bring about a better frame of mind; but he soon found\r\nthat this system was capable of improvement. His first act was to\r\nplace the prisoners white or black in the stocks in the middle of the\r\nyard, so that they should be exposed to the observation and remarks\r\nof all the officials and visitors and their fellow-prisoners. In\r\nexplaining the reasons for this change, he said that he found that\r\nin a cool cell a man could be tolerably comfortable and that even the\r\nmost hardened of them preferred not to be seen in the stocks by\r\nothers; whereas in the yard they were obliged to sit on the uneven\r\ngravel and to endure the heat of the sun as well as being 'the\r\ncynosure of every eye.' But this did not satisfy the ingenious Du\r\nPlessis. The yard of the Pretoria gaol inclines from south to north\r\nabout one foot in four, and Du Plessis' observant eye detected that\r\nthe prisoners invariably sat facing down the slope--for of course\r\nthey were not allowed to lie down while in the stocks, this being too\r\ncomfortable a position. Upon studying the question he found that in\r\nthis way much more ease was experienced owing to the more obtuse\r\nangle thus formed by the body and the legs. This did not suit him and\r\nhe issued further orders that in future all prisoners in the stocks\r\nshould be obliged to sit facing uphill, and that they should not be\r\nallowed to hold on to the stocks in order to maintain themselves in\r\nthis position but should have to preserve the upright posture of the\r\nbody by means of the exertion of the muscles of the back alone.\r\nNeedless to say the maintenance of such a position for hours at a\r\ntime caused an agony of aches which many prisoners were quite unable\r\nto endure, and frequently the men were seen to throw themselves back\r\nand lie down at the risk of being kicked up by the vigilant Du\r\nPlessis and confined in the stocks for a longer period than was\r\noriginally intended. Nor did this complete the list of Mr. Du\r\nPlessis' ingenuities. The stocks had been built to accommodate\r\nseveral persons at the same time, and he found that by inserting the\r\nlegs in the alternate holes, instead of in the pair as designed by\r\nthe architect of the stocks, the increased spread of the legs caused\r\nstill greater strain upon his victim. This was reserved for special\r\ncases--say one in every four or five.\r\n\r\nThe incidents here given illustrating the methods of this delectable\r\nindividual were all witnessed by the Reformers. The account of Du\r\nPlessis may serve the purpose of showing the methods practised under\r\na Government whose officials are appointed whenever possible from the\r\nfamily circle and not because of fitness. It is more especially\r\ndesigned to show the character of the man in whose hands the\r\nprisoners were placed with almost absolute discretion; the man who\r\nenjoys the privilege of discussing with his relative President\r\nKruger, at any hour at which he may choose to visit the Presidency,\r\nthe treatment to be accorded to his victims; the man who is retained\r\nin his position in spite of repeated exposures by his superiors, and\r\nwho is credited with exercising very considerable influence with Mr.\r\nKruger; but, above all, the man in whose charge remain up to the\r\npresent time{37} the two Reformers, Messrs. Sampson and Davies, who\r\ndeclined to sign any petition, and concerning whom Du Plessis stated\r\nopenly: 'Wait until the others have gone, and if the Government leave\r\nthem in my hands, I'll make them ready to sign anything.' Sufficient\r\nhas been said concerning this individual to warrant the description\r\npublicly given of him by Colonel Rhodes{38}--'A brutal and inhuman\r\nwretch!' Like most bullies the man is also a coward. When he\r\nwitnessed the outburst of feeling among the prisoners in consequence\r\nof the death of their comrade, he would not venture into the\r\nprecincts of the gaol for two days, until assured that the men had\r\nagain become capable of self-control.\r\n\r\nSo much for the details of gaol life.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime sympathy with the prisoners began to take practical\r\nform, and the unanimity of feeling on their behalf throughout South\r\nAfrica, which was quite unexpected and which greatly embarrassed\r\nthe Boer Government, tended to bring matters to a head. Mr. Rose\r\nInnes, who had so generously and constantly exerted himself in\r\nPretoria in order to obtain some amelioration of the condition of the\r\nprisoners, and who had in his official capacity as watching the case\r\nfor the Imperial Government made a very strong report to the Colonial\r\nOffice, did not content himself with these exertions. Upon his return\r\nto Capetown he suggested and organized the getting up of a monster\r\npetition to the President and Executive, urging upon them in the\r\ninterests of the peace of South Africa to release the imprisoned men.\r\nThe petitions were to represent the views of every town and village\r\nin South Africa, and were to be presented by the mayors or municipal\r\nheads of the communities. In this movement Mr. Rose Innes was most\r\nably seconded by Mr. Edmund Garrett, the editor of the _Cape Times,_\r\nand other prominent men. A movement of this nature naturally excited\r\nconsiderable attention in Pretoria; but the success of it was wholly\r\nunexpected. The President and his party had played to the South\r\nAfrican gallery, and they had not yet realized that they had in any\r\nway overdone the theatrical part. They had no suspicion of the real\r\nfeeling with which the sentences were regarded, nor of the extent to\r\nwhich they had alienated sympathy by that and the subsequent\r\n'magnanimous' action. 'Magnanimity by inches' had been placarded\r\nthroughout South Africa, and the whole game was characterized as one\r\nof cat and mouse, in which the President was playing with his victims\r\nwith indifference to the demands of justice and humanity, partly with\r\na view to wringing concessions from the British Government, and\r\npartly from a mistaken idea that by such a course he would obtain\r\ncredit at each step afresh for dealing generously with those who were\r\nat his mercy.\r\n\r\nThe movement had been well organized. The resolution had been passed\r\nin every town in South Africa, even including the towns of the Free\r\nState. The mayors (over 200 in number) were on their way to Pretoria,\r\nwhen the President, with his back against the wall, realized for the\r\nfirst time that he had overshot the mark and that unless he released\r\nthe men before the arrival of the deputies he would either have to\r\ndo so apparently at their instance, or refuse to do so and risk\r\nrousing a dangerous feeling. He chose the former course; he released\r\nall the imprisoned men with the exception of the four who had been\r\nsentenced to death and the two who had refused to appeal. Pretoria\r\nand Johannesburg were already full of deputies and visitors from Cape\r\nColony, Natal, and the Free State, all bound on the same errand of\r\nmercy. The feelings of these men, brought many hundreds of miles from\r\ntheir homes, sacrificing their own business and personal convenience\r\nin order to approach the President and to support a measure which\r\nthey felt to be imperatively necessary to the allaying of feeling in\r\nSouth Africa may be imagined, but were not expressed, when they heard\r\nthat they had been allowed to undertake this journey as part of the\r\nPresident's game, only to receive a slap in the face from His Honour\r\nby the carrying out of the measure before they were permitted to\r\ninterview him. This at least was what was felt to be the case upon\r\nthe release of the majority. Absolute proof of it was forthcoming\r\nwithin the week, when the President refused to receive the\r\ndeputations and kept them waiting in Pretoria until he had released\r\nthe four leaders as well, without allowing the delegates the\r\nsatisfaction of a courteous recognition of their mission. He admitted\r\nthem it is true to an informal interview, in the course of which he\r\nmanaged to insult and outrage the feelings of a good many by\r\nlecturing them and giving vent to very candid opinions as to their\r\npersonal action and duties; but he would not receive their\r\nrepresentatives officially.\r\n\r\nOn May 30 the prisoners with the exception of the six already\r\nreferred to were released, the terms being that their fines should be\r\npaid at once, and the unexpired term of imprisonment remitted. Each\r\none as released was required to bind himself for the term of three\r\nyears, reckoned from the 30th day of May, 1896, neither directly nor\r\nindirectly to meddle in the internal or external politics of the\r\nSouth African Republic, and to conduct himself as a law-abiding\r\ncitizen of the State.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the provision was added that if in the opinion of the\r\nExecutive Council the terms of this undertaking should be broken,\r\nthe sentence of banishment which was held in suspense would come into\r\nforce, and the men were required to sign this addendum to the above\r\nundertaking. The resolution of the Executive Council, which deals\r\nwith the mitigation of the sentences, states that the imprisonment\r\nportions of the sentences are remitted; that the fines (£2,000 in all\r\ncases) must be paid at once; and that the banishment shall remain in\r\nabeyance subject to the faithful observance of the above undertaking;\r\nbut that should any action be taken by any of the prisoners\r\nconstituting in the opinion of the Executive Council a breach of the\r\nabove undertaking, the sentence of banishment shall come into force.\r\n\r\nThere is no definition of the phrase 'meddle in politics,' nor is\r\nthere any indication of what in the opinion of the Executive Council\r\nconstitutes politics. There is of course on record the President's\r\nown statement in public that he would not permit any discussion on\r\nthe dynamite and railway questions because they are matters of 'high\r\npolitics'; and if haply the Executive should also hold this view, it\r\nis difficult to see how any of the prisoners will be able to follow\r\ntheir ordinary business and attend to those commercial affairs in\r\nwhich they are concerned without committing some breach of this\r\nridiculous provision.\r\n\r\nNo answer was received to the many representations made on behalf of\r\nthe four leaders, except that the Government were busy with the\r\nmatter. Upon the release of the other prisoners it was suggested to\r\nthem by friends outside that it would be a proper and politic course\r\nto proceed in a body to the Presidency and thank the President for\r\nthe action he had taken in their respect, and at the same time to beg\r\nof him to extend a similar clemency to the four leaders who were\r\nstill left in gaol. Most of the men were dead against taking any such\r\naction. They held very strongly to the opinion that they had been\r\narrested by treachery, condemned by arrangement, and played with as\r\ncounters in an unscrupulous manner. They recognized no obligation\r\ntowards the President. They could see no magnanimity in a policy\r\nwhich had secured their arrest under the circumstances described\r\nwhich inveigled them into pleading guilty to a nominal offence,\r\nand which imposed upon them a sentence such as that passed. They\r\nconsidered the enormous fine which they were then called upon to\r\npay to say nothing of the imprisonment which they had already\r\nsuffered wholly disproportionate to the offence, and their natural\r\nimpulse was to avoid the man who was directly responsible for it all,\r\nor at least not to meet him under circumstances so unequal, when they\r\nwould be sure to be insulted, and would be obliged to suffer the\r\ninsult in silence.\r\n\r\nSome of them however yielded to the representations of their friends,\r\nwho considered that it should be done for the sake of the men who\r\nwere not yet released; whilst there were others who expressed the\r\nview that they would rather go back and do their imprisonment than\r\nsuffer the humiliation which it was proposed to inflict; that they\r\nwould not do it for themselves, and they could not bring themselves\r\nto do it for anybody else. A considerable number of the prisoners\r\ncalled upon His Honour; and this was the 'dog' interview. After\r\nhearing the address of the men the President proceeded to pat himself\r\nand his people on the back, saying that he knew he had behaved with\r\ngreat magnanimity and moderation, and that he hoped that such\r\ngenerosity would not be entirely thrown away.\r\n\r\n'You must know,' he said, 'that I sometimes have to punish my dogs;\r\nand I find that there are dogs of two kinds. Some of them who are\r\ngood come back and lick my boots. Others get away at a distance and\r\nsnarl at me. I see that some are still snarling. I am glad that you\r\nare not like them.'\r\n\r\nThose among his hearers who could understand His Honour's remarks,\r\nalthough they had been prepared for much, were certainly not prepared\r\nfor this. The interpreter stood for a moment without rendering into\r\nEnglish the metaphor chosen by the worthy President, and even His\r\nHonour--slow to perceive where he has transgressed the limits of\r\netiquette and good breeding--gathered from the expressions upon the\r\nfaces that something was wrong, and turning to the interpreter, said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's only my joke! Don't interpret that to them.'\r\n\r\nBut those who witnessed it say that there was no joke in his voice or\r\nhis eye as he said it. Proceeding then with more circumspection he\r\nwalked out his dog in another form, and said that it was very well to\r\npunish the little dogs as he had punished them, but somebody should\r\nalso punish the big dog--evidently referring to Mr. Rhodes--and in\r\nthe course of a homily he again mixed his parable, sticking all the\r\ntime to his dog however, remarking in conclusion that it was very\r\nwell to punish the dogs, but what was to happen to the owner of the\r\ndogs, who stood by urging them on and crying 'Tsaa!'?\r\n\r\nThroughout the week His Honour continued to make the homely dog work\r\nto good purpose, but the interview with the released Reformers was,\r\nit is believed, the first occasion upon which he made use of it.\r\nCertainly on no other occasion did the President do such ample\r\njustice to his reputation as a finished diplomat.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time negotiations had been proceeding for obtaining the\r\nrelease of the leaders. The friends and representatives of the four\r\nprisoners had become subject to all manner of attentions from numbers\r\nof people in Pretoria; near relations of the President himself,\r\nhigh-placed Government officials, their relatives, hangers-on,\r\nprominent Boers, and persons of all sorts and descriptions, all\r\noffered their services and indicated means by which the thing could\r\nbe arranged. All wanted money--personal bribes. The prisoners\r\nthemselves were similarly approached, and they who a month previously\r\nhad been condemned to death witnessed with disgust a keen competition\r\namong their enemies for the privilege of effecting--at a price--their\r\nrelease. Day after day they were subjected to the disgusting\r\nimportunities of these men--men who a little while before had been\r\nvaunting their patriotism and loudly expressing a desire to prove it\r\nby hanging these same Reformers.\r\n\r\nThe gaoler Du Plessis, representing himself as having been sent by\r\nthe President, suggested to the four men that they should 'make a\r\npetition.' They declined to do so. Du Plessis was then reinforced by\r\nthe Chief Commissioner of Police, and the two officials again urged\r\nthis course but stated that they did not wish it to be known that\r\nthey had been sent by the Executive and therefore could not\r\nconsent to their names being used. Upon these terms the prisoners\r\nagain declined. They said that if they were to hold any communication\r\nwith the Government they required to have it on record that they did\r\nso at the suggestion of the two responsible gaol officials who\r\nrepresented themselves as expressing the wish of the Executive\r\nCouncil. After further delay and consultations with the President and\r\nothers the two officials above named consented to allow their names\r\nto be used in the manner indicated. Not content with this the\r\nprisoners demanded that they should be allowed to send an independent\r\nmessenger to the President to ascertain whether he really required a\r\nwritten appeal for revision of sentence. Having received confirmation\r\nin this manner the four men addressed a letter to the Executive\r\nCouncil. In this letter they stated that they had been sentenced to\r\ndeath; that the death-sentence had been commuted; and that they\r\nunderstood--but had received no authoritative information on the\r\nsubject--that they were to suffer instead a term of fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment. They suggested the imposition of a monetary penalty in\r\nplace of the imprisonment; they stated that they held and represented\r\nimportant interests in the State and that they believed their release\r\nwould tend to the restoration of confidence and favourable conditions\r\nin the business community of the Rand; and they concluded by saying\r\nthat, if the Executive saw fit to adopt this suggestion, they the\r\nprisoners would return to their business in good faith.\r\n\r\nIt had frequently been intimated to these men that it would be\r\nimpossible for the Government to impose a fine in place of the\r\ndeath-sentence because money so obtained would be blood-money.\r\nReference had been made in the Executive Council to Biblical\r\nprecedents, notably the case of Judas, and the opinion was held that\r\nif blood-money were taken the Lord would visit His wrath upon the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Boers are in their way a very religious people. But they are also\r\nessentially practical; and it is difficult to find an instance in\r\nwhich the religious principle has operated to their commercial\r\ndisadvantage. This at any rate was not one. The train of reasoning\r\nwhich led them to justify the imposition of a fine was somewhat in\r\nthis wise: To _impose a fine_ would be to take blood-money, and\r\nwould be immoral and iniquitous: to _accept the offer of a present_\r\non condition that the sentence should be entirely remitted however\r\nwould be quite another thing.\r\n\r\nSo negotiations were set on foot to induce the prisoners to make the\r\nnecessary offer; and the prisoners, as has been shown, did so. This\r\nsatisfied the religious scruple of the Boer, but the terms of the\r\noffer were not satisfactory to his commercial requirements. It became\r\nnecessary to make a definite offer. Further negotiations followed,\r\nand the prisoners gathered that an offer of £10,000 apiece would be\r\nviewed with favour by the President and his advisers; and it was\r\nstated by members of the Volksraad and prominent officials who were\r\nin the confidence of and in communication with the Government that,\r\nin the event of such a contingency arising as the prisoners making an\r\noffer of cash, the Executive would not take the money for the benefit\r\nof the State but would accept it for charitable purposes--an\r\neducational institute or a hospital or some such object.\r\n\r\nThis was communicated to the prisoners by the personages referred to,\r\nand an offer was accordingly made of £10,000 apiece. The matter was\r\ndiscussed in the Executive Council, and the Boer, true to his\r\ninstinct and record, perceived an opportunity to improve his\r\nposition. The religious gentlemen who would not take blood-money now\r\nobjected that the amount proposed was altogether too small, and the\r\nPresident with that readiness so characteristic of him observed that\r\nhe thought the prisoners must have made a mistake, and meant £40,000\r\napiece instead of £40,000 for the lot.\r\n\r\nAnother delay ensued, and in the meanwhile more and more deputies\r\nflocked to Pretoria, and stronger grew the feeling, and more angry,\r\ndisappointed, and disgusted grew the communities of Johannesburg and\r\nPretoria. The President, however, played his game unmoved by any such\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nThe next announcement from the Executive was a wholly unexpected one.\r\nIt was that they felt it necessary to consult Judge Gregorowski as to\r\nthe amount of money which ought to be taken as a donation to\r\ncharities. The matter of assessing the value of a death-sentence in\r\ncash might perhaps be deemed a perplexing and a difficult one from\r\nlack of precedent, yet nobody supposed the Executive Council to be\r\nunequal to the task. It might also seem unfair to impose this further\r\nburden of responsibility upon a judge; but Mr. Gregorowski had proved\r\nhimself superior to precedent and untrammelled by custom; and there\r\nwas much to be said in favour of continuing an association which had\r\nworked very satisfactorily so far.\r\n\r\nWhen however the President, with that resolute determination to be\r\ngenerous which was so well advertised, at last overcame all obstacles\r\nand succeeded in holding a meeting of his advisers to receive Mr.\r\nGregorowski's report, and when it was found that that gentleman\r\nassessed capital punishment at £25,000 per head, the Executive\r\nCouncil with one accord avowed themselves to be so utterly taken by\r\nsurprise by the announcement that they required time to think the\r\nmatter over and decide upon a course of action.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this opinion of Mr. Gregorowski's took them quite as much by\r\nsurprise as did his original sentences. However in the course of a\r\nday or two they had recovered sufficiently to intimate to the\r\nprisoners that, if they would amend their first offer of £40,000 for\r\nthe four and make it one of £40,000 apiece, the Executive would\r\ndecline to accept so large a sum, as being greater than they\r\nconsidered equitable and would reply that in the opinion of the\r\nGovernment £25,000 apiece would be sufficient. It was quite plainly\r\nintimated that this procedure presented certain attractions to the\r\nPresident, who desired for political purposes to exhibit further\r\nmagnanimity. The prisoners who by this time had gained some insight\r\ninto Mr. Kruger's methods, who knew from past experience the value of\r\nhis promises, and who could find no record in history to encourage\r\nthem in participating to this extent in the confidence trick,\r\npoint-blank refused to have anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nThey agreed to make a formal offer of a 'reasonable' fine, leaving\r\nthe interpretation of this to the Government, but only on the\r\ndistinct understanding that the amount should not exceed £25,000\r\neach. They had learned that Mr. Gregorowski had fixed this amount and\r\nthat the Executive had agreed to accept it, and they would not offer\r\na penny more for magnanimity or anything else. They stated in\r\nplain terms that they looked upon this matter simply as a bargain;\r\nthat if they should get out they were paying their way out, and that\r\nin so far as their release from the position was concerned the\r\ntransaction was closed upon business terms and there should be no\r\nquestion afterwards as to gratitude or magnanimity. The fines were\r\npaid,{39} and on July 11 the leaders were released.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Phillips, Farrar, and Hammond, who were compelled through\r\ntheir business ties to continue their association with the Transvaal,\r\nsigned the same undertaking concerning politics as that given by the\r\nrest of the prisoners--with the difference that in their case it\r\noperates for a period of fifteen years. Colonel Rhodes however\r\ndeclined to give the required undertaking and elected to take his\r\nsentence of fifteen years' banishment. On the night of June 11\r\ntherefore he was sent across the border under escort, and passing\r\nthrough the Free State proceeded at once to Matabeleland to render\r\nwhat assistance he could to his brother in the suppression of the\r\nrebellion. As though the excitement of the past few months had not\r\nbeen sufficient, it may be added that in the first engagement in\r\nwhich he took part on his arrival at Buluwayo his horse was shot, and\r\nhe narrowly escaped the same fate himself.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time adverse comment has been made on the subject of\r\nthis undertaking of the Reformers to abstain from further\r\nparticipation in politics. The position of the Reformers was this:\r\nThey had entered upon the movement to obtain the redress of certain\r\nmatters closely affecting their feelings as men and their interests\r\nand business as settlers in the country. They were disarmed and\r\nplaced at the mercy of the Boer Government by the action of England's\r\nRepresentative. To decline to give the pledge required would entail\r\nbanishment, which would in many cases mean ruin to them and in all\r\ncases would remove them from the sphere in which they might yet\r\ncontribute to the attainment of the ends they had in view. The only\r\ncompensating consideration possible in such a course would be that\r\nthe redress desired would be effected through the influence of the\r\nImperial Government; but since the Imperial Government had shown\r\nthat under the circumstances they were neither willing nor able to\r\nmaintain to a logical conclusion the position which they took up when\r\nthey secured disarmament, the Reformers concluded that their obvious\r\ncourse was to give the required undertaking. It is true that several\r\namong them did decline to give this undertaking, saying that they\r\nwould prefer to serve their terms of imprisonment; but they received\r\nthe answer that after the term of two years' imprisonment the\r\nGovernment would still require the undertaking or enforce the\r\nbanishment clause, so that it appeared to them there was no way out\r\nof it but to sign what was required and wait patiently.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly obvious that one of two alternatives will present\r\nitself. Either the Government will come to regard this provision as a\r\ndead letter, and wholly ignore it; or some of the men, in the course\r\nof their business and in dealing with economic questions such as they\r\nare morally entitled to discuss will fall foul of the 'opinion of the\r\nExecutive.' The issue will then be a very clear one, and many of\r\nthose who were strongly opposed to the Reformers on the premisses on\r\nwhich they started will find themselves in cordial agreement with\r\nthem in later developments.{40}\r\n\r\nThe Reform movement closed for the time being with the release of the\r\nleaders. Sixty-four men had been committed for trial. From four of\r\nthem the Government had received £100,000, and from fifty-six others\r\n£112,000. One was dead; one had fallen so seriously ill before the\r\ntrial that he was unable to present himself with the rest, but on\r\nrecovering and announcing his intention to plead 'Not guilty' and\r\nfight it out, the case against him was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThere remained two men, Messrs. Sampson and Davies, whose case the\r\nGovernment had refused to consider because they declined to appeal.\r\nThey had been sentenced on April 28 to two years' imprisonment and\r\n£2,000 fine, or failing payment to another year's imprisonment, and\r\nto three years' banishment; and under that sentence do they lie at\r\nthe present moment in the Pretoria gaol, at the mercy of the Boer\r\nGovernment and its very competent representative Mr. Du Plessis.{41}\r\n\r\nMuch _kudos_ has accrued to Mr. Kruger for his magnanimity and much\r\nprofit for his astuteness! Great credit is also given to Mr.\r\nChamberlain for his prompt impartiality. And surely some day a\r\ntribute of sympathy and admiration will go out from a people who like\r\npluck and who love fair play to two Englishmen who hold that a solemn\r\npledge is something which even a Boer should hold to, whilst\r\nself-respect is more than liberty and beyond all price.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter IX\r\n\r\n{35} This was done on the second day--after a night without any\r\nventilation at all.\r\n\r\n{36} See Appendix E.\r\n\r\n{37} (July, 1899.) They were released in June, 1897.\r\n\r\n{38} Du Plessis' threats regarding Messrs. Sampson and Davies were\r\nmade so openly and vengefully that Colonel F.W. Rhodes deemed it to\r\nbe his duty as soon as he was released to report the matter to the\r\nHigh Commissioner, with a view to ensuring some measure of protection\r\nfor the two gentlemen above referred to. After the release of\r\nthe other prisoners, Du Plessis was for a time suspended, owing\r\nto charges laid against him by the Inspector of Prisons. No\r\ninvestigation appears however to have been made, and the man was\r\nreinstated. During the month of September, after Messrs. Sampson and\r\nDavies had already done five months of their sentence in Pretoria\r\nGaol, this man, finding himself unable to break their spirit by other\r\nmeans, made a proposal to the Government to separate the two and to\r\nplace them in two small country gaols at wide distances apart and far\r\nremoved from the friendly offices and watchful eyes of their friends,\r\nand thus deprive them of such benefit as they may be able _in the\r\nfuture_ to get from proximity to the official representative of\r\nEngland. In the past they have certainly derived none.\r\n\r\n{39} It seems like reflecting on the reader's intelligence to add\r\nthat nothing more has been heard of the 'charities.'\r\n\r\n{40} (July, 1899.) A clear indication of the Government's disposition\r\ntowards the Reformers was given by the treatment accorded to Mr.\r\nLionel Phillips. In consequence of a publication by Sir John\r\nWilloughby of an article on the subject of the Raid, which failed to\r\naccurately represent the facts as they were present to the minds of\r\nthe Reformers, Mr. Phillips wrote an article in the _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_ magazine, which was purely historical, moderate in tone, and\r\nobviously designed only as an answer to the allegations which had\r\nbeen made. The Executive Council arrived at the conclusion that it\r\nwas a breach of his undertaking to abstain from interference in\r\npolitics, and they issued a decree of banishment against him. As Mr.\r\nPhillips had taken up his residence permanently in Europe, and as it\r\nwas well known that it would be extremely inconvenient for him to\r\nreturn to South Africa in order to dispute this action it was\r\ngenerally considered that the object of the move was to establish\r\na precedent, so to say, on the cheap, and in the same spirit to\r\nintimidate others among the Reformers who were believed not to have\r\nlost their interest in the cause of reform nor to have abandoned\r\ntheir intention to begin again as soon as they were free to do so. It\r\nis no exaggeration to say that scarcely a week could have passed\r\nduring the last two and a half years in which some or all of the half\r\ndozen Uitlanders most prominent in the cause of reform have not been\r\nin receipt of a warning of one kind or another, ranging from\r\napparently friendly advice not to take too keen an interest in\r\ncertain matters, up to the giddy eminence of being black listed in\r\nthe Dutch papers as one of those to be dragged out and shot without\r\ntrial as a traitor and a rebel. Such are the conditions under which\r\nthe unarmed Uitlanders labour for reform.\r\n\r\n{41} (July, 1899.) Du Plessis was promoted to be Chief Inspector of\r\nPrisons shortly after the release of Messrs. Sampson and Davies,\r\nand still holds that post!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nA POSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHREE YEARS' GRACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery seldom has any community been in a position so unsatisfactory as\r\nthat in which the people of Johannesburg found themselves in the year\r\n1896. Judgments passed in the heat of the moment upon matters which\r\nhad not been properly explained, and which in many cases were\r\ncompletely obscured by deliberate misrepresentation, had incurred for\r\nthe community dislike contempt and mistrust which were wholly\r\nundeserved. Those who knew the facts and who were able and willing to\r\nspeak, the Reformers themselves, were bonded to abstain from politics\r\nfor three years under penalty of banishment. Betrayed, deserted,\r\nmuzzled, helpless, hopeless, and divided, no community could have\r\nbeen in a more unsatisfactory condition. It was abundantly clear that\r\nthe time had been allowed to pass when the Imperial Government might\r\nhave insisted upon reforms and the fulfilment of the President's\r\npromises--not in the spirit in which they had been made, but in the\r\nspirit in which the President himself had intended the world to\r\nconstrue them. The impact of the revelations was too great to permit\r\nof public judgment quickly recovering its balance. It was realized\r\nthat Mr. Kruger's effects had been admirably stage-managed and that\r\nfor the time being, and possibly for a very considerable time, the\r\nUitlanders were completely out of court. There were a few--but how\r\nfew!--whose faith was great and whose conviction that the truth must\r\nprevail was abiding, who realized that there was nothing for it but\r\nto begin all over again--to begin and to persevere upon sound lines;\r\nand they took heart of such signs as there were and started afresh.\r\n\r\nIt has been an article of faith with them that Mr. Kruger missed\r\nhis supreme chance at the time of the trial of the Reformers, and\r\nthat from the date of the death-sentence his judgment and his luck\r\nhave failed him. He abused his good fortune and the luck turned, so\r\nthey say; and the events of the last three years go to support that\r\nimpression. To his most faithful ally amongst the Uitlanders the\r\nPresident, in the latter days of 1896, commented adversely upon the\r\ningratitude of those Reformers who had not called to thank him for\r\nhis magnanimity; and this man replied: 'You must stop talking about\r\nthat, President, because people are laughing at you. You made a\r\nbargain with them and they paid the price you asked, so now they owe\r\nyou nothing.' But his Honour angrily repudiated that construction:\r\nnothing will convert him to that view.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Dr. Jameson is the best friend Paul Kruger ever\r\nhad, and with equal truth it may be said that, in 1896, President\r\nKruger proved himself to be the best friend of the Reformers. Not\r\neven the most sanguine of his enemies could have expected to witness\r\nthe impolitic and unjust acts by which the President revealed\r\nhimself, vindicated the Reformers, and undermined a position of\r\nunparalleled strength in an incredibly short time. The bargaining and\r\nthe bad grace which marked the release of the Reformers had prepared\r\nthe world to view Mr. Kruger's action and attitude a little more\r\ncritically than it had hitherto been disposed to do. The real\r\nconditions of Dr. Jameson's surrender had also become known, and\r\nalthough the action of the Boer leaders was regarded as far too\r\ntrifling a matter to be seriously considered as against the Raid\r\nitself, nevertheless a residuum of impression was left which helped\r\nto form opinion at a later stage. There followed, too, an irritating\r\ncorrespondence between the Transvaal and Imperial Governments, in the\r\ncourse of which Dr. Leyds successfully established his skill as a\r\nsmart letter writer and his limitations as a statesman. The\r\nMunicipal Law, the first product of the 'forget and forgive'\r\nproclamation--which proclamation, by-the-bye, had already begun to\r\nprove itself an awkward weapon placed in the hands of his enemies by\r\nPresident Kruger himself--had been exposed and denounced as farcical,\r\nand it now required but little to convince the once admiring world of\r\nthe President's real character and intentions. That little was\r\nforthcoming in a touch of ridicule more potent than all arguments.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Government formulated their demand for damages for the\r\nRaid in a form which made everyone smile--£677,938 3s. 3d. for actual\r\noutlay, and £1,000,000 for 'Moral and Intellectual Damages.' What\r\nwith the fines of the Reformers, and the seizure of the provisions of\r\nall sorts acquired by them for the purposes of the Reform movement,\r\nwhich latter must have exceeded £50,000 in value, the Boer Government\r\nhad already received upwards of a quarter of a million, and had, in\r\nfact, made a profit on the Raid; so that this demand came as a\r\nsurprise even to the Uitlanders, as much perhaps due to the\r\nextraordinary phrasing of the demand as to the amount claimed.\r\n\r\nIt may be wondered why, under provocation so great as that of\r\ncomplete abandonment by the country whose representative had placed\r\nthem in their then hopeless position, no distinct movement took\r\nplace--no tendency even developed itself--among the Uitlanders\r\ngenerally to unite with the Boers in favour of a Republican movement\r\nthroughout South Africa, to the exclusion of the Imperial power. In\r\nanswer to this it must be said that such an idea undoubtedly did take\r\nstrong hold of the non-British portion of the Uitlander population,\r\nas witness the manner in which the Cape Colony Dutchmen, Hollanders,\r\nGermans, and individuals of other European nationalities associated\r\nthemselves with the Boer party, almost invariably by open\r\ndeclaration, and in many cases even by naturalization, thus\r\nforfeiting their own national rights and obtaining nothing but vague\r\npromises and the liability to military service in return. But the\r\nRepublican movement made no further headway than this because British\r\nsubjects formed the large majority of the Uitlanders. They had, it is\r\ntrue, a great grievance against the Imperial Government; but against\r\nthe Transvaal Government they had one greater still; and it would\r\ntake a great deal to kill the passionate loyalty of the British South\r\nAfrican. It would be idle to discuss what might have happened had Mr.\r\nKruger seized his opportunity and let in a considerable section of\r\nthe then unenfranchised to strengthen the ranks of the Republican\r\nparty; that can only be a matter of individual conjecture. What is\r\ncertain, however, is that he did not do so and never intended to do\r\nso; wherein his lack of statesmanship is again made manifest.\r\n\r\nMr. Kruger has carried out in its fullest (its best or its worst) the\r\ncharacteristic principle of his people already referred to, that of\r\ngiving too little and asking too much. It is doing only bare justice\r\nto the determination with which he adheres to the policy of his life\r\nto say that he gives nothing to anybody. From the most distant to the\r\nnearest he deals alike with all. With the people of Europe, he has\r\ntaxed their investments, disregarded their interests, and flouted\r\ntheir advice; but nevertheless he has for years commanded their moral\r\nsupport. In his dealings with the British Government, pushed as they\r\nhave been some half a dozen times to the very verge of war, he has\r\ninvariably come off with something for nothing. In his dealings with\r\nthe Uitlanders he has bartered promises and in return--_circumspice_!\r\nIn the matter of the events of 1895-6 he came out with a quarter of a\r\nmillion in cash, a claim for £1,677,938 3s. 3d. odd (including Moral\r\nand Intellectual Damages), and a balance of injured innocence which\r\nmay not be expressed in figures. In his dealings with Cape Colony he\r\nhas taxed the products of their land and industry, he went to the\r\nverge of war to destroy their trade in the case of the closing of the\r\nVaal River drifts, he has permitted the Netherlands Railway to so\r\narrange its tariffs as to divert traffic from them to other parts, he\r\nhas refused to their people (his own flesh and blood, among whom he\r\nwas born) the most elementary rights when they settle in his country!\r\nAnd yet in his need he calls upon them, and they come! His treatment\r\nof the Orange Free State has been exactly the same. Their grievance\r\nagainst him is incomparably worse, because of their liability to\r\nbecome involved in the consequences of a policy which they are not\r\nallowed to influence. But President Kruger is, above all things,\r\npractical. Everything is gauged by the measure of the advantage which\r\nit can bring to him; and his treatment of the Free State is\r\ndetermined by their utility to him and his power over them, and is\r\nnot influenced by their moral claims upon his good will. Natal and\r\nPortugal have their experience of broken agreements and strained\r\ninterpretations, of intrigues with native subjects and neighbours\r\nfor the extension of rights or boundaries, all designed to benefit\r\nthe Transvaal and to undermine them. All, all with the same result!\r\nSomething for nothing! Within the borders of the Transvaal the policy\r\nis the same. Moral rights and the claims of justice are unrecognized.\r\nFor services rendered there may be some return; a privilege, a\r\ncontract, an appointment. But this cannot be properly regarded as a\r\nneglect of principle upon Mr. Kruger's part, for after all the reward\r\nis at the expense of the Uitlanders. It is usually the least price at\r\nwhich the service could be secured; and it is generally in such\r\nform as to give the recipient a profit in which the members of the\r\nGovernment party largely share, but it never confers a power to\r\nwhich the President himself is not superior; indeed, it is almost\r\ninvariably hedged about by such conditions as to make its continuance\r\ndependent upon the President's good will. If any one should\r\nthink this description of conditions in the Transvaal and of the\r\nPresident's policy to be unduly harsh, let him satisfy himself by an\r\ninvestigation of those matters which appear on merely superficial\r\nexamination to support opinions contrary to those expressed by the\r\nwriter. Let him examine the terms of the closer union with the Free\r\nState, the circumstances leading to the closing of the Vaal River\r\ndrifts, the condition of the Dutch subjects of Cape Colony and of the\r\nOrange Free State in the Transvaal, the Netherlands Railway tariffs\r\nas they operate against Cape Colony and the Free State, the Railway\r\nAgreement with Natal, the disputes with Portugal, the attempts to\r\nacquire native territory on the East Coast, the terms of the\r\nNetherlands Railway Concession, Selati Railway Concession, Dynamite\r\nConcession--in fact, all other concessions, monopolies, contracts,\r\nprivileges, appointments, and rights, made, granted, or entered\r\ninto by President Kruger to or with his friends. Let him recall the\r\ntreatment and the fate of some of those to whom ampler reference\r\nwill be made later on; for instance, Chief Justice Kotzé and\r\nJudge Ameshof, who in the dealings with the Reformers rendered\r\nvaluable--but perhaps injudicious and unjudicial--service, as already\r\nsufficiently described; the treatment of Dr. Coster, the State\r\nAttorney, who also deserved better of the President; the public\r\nrepudiation of Mr. J.B. Robinson, whose friendship for President\r\nKruger had been frequently and amply evidenced to the grave\r\ndissatisfaction of the Uitlander population; the public and insulting\r\nrepudiation of Sir Henry de Villiers, the Chief Justice of Cape\r\nColony, after he had served his purpose! The result of any such\r\ninquiry must confirm the conclusion that 'something for nothing' is\r\nthe President's policy and achievement.\r\n\r\nA policy or a movement which is to involve the cooperation of\r\nthousands of intelligent men cannot be carried out upon such terms,\r\nand this may be regarded as the main reason why the spirit of\r\nRepublicanism did not generally itself develop under circumstances\r\napparently so favourable to it. The President's policy may be\r\nconsidered astute or unwise according to the point of view from which\r\nit is regarded. Viewed from the standpoint of the State itself,\r\nundoubtedly it fails lamentably in statesmanship. In the interests of\r\nthe Boer party, however, or of the man Paul Kruger, it may well be\r\ndoubted whether the policy may not be a token of remarkable sagacity.\r\nHe knows his own limitations and the limitations of his people. He\r\nknows that to freely admit to a share in the Government a number of\r\nintelligent people, would make a continuance of himself or his party\r\nin absolute power for any length of time a matter of utter\r\nimpossibility. In these circumstances the problem which President\r\nKruger had set himself was a remarkably difficult one. To\r\nrepublicanize South Africa, to secure the support of the majority of\r\nthe white inhabitants, and yet to yield no whit of power to those by\r\nwhose aid he would achieve his object, would indeed be carrying to\r\nsublime heights the policy of 'something for nothing.'\r\n\r\nMany years before the Raid Mr. Kruger had a well-defined policy to\r\nrepublicanize South Africa, and the Uitlanders of the Transvaal were\r\nquite alive to it, as may be gathered by reference to their\r\nnewspapers. But the voice was as a voice crying in the wilderness in\r\nthose days, and, as has been said, it required the Jameson Raid to\r\nadvertize the conditions in the Transvaal and to direct attention to\r\nwhat had been proclaimed unheeded for many years. Immediately prior\r\nto the Raid Mr. Kruger was floundering in a morass of difficulties.\r\nThe policy of 'something for nothing' had been exposed, and it was\r\nseen through by all the Dutchmen in South Africa and was resented by\r\nall save his own little party in the Transvaal; but the Jameson Raid\r\ngave the President a jumping-off place on solid ground, and he was\r\nnot slow to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that the vast majority of people in Europe\r\nand America are indebted to Dr. Jameson for any knowledge which they\r\nmay have acquired of the Transvaal and its Uitlander problem. Theirs\r\nis a disordered knowledge, and perhaps it is not unnatural that they\r\nshould in a manner share the illusion of the worthy sailor who, after\r\nattending divine service, assaulted the first Israelite he met\r\nbecause he had only just heard of the Crucifixion. A number of worthy\r\npeople are still disposed to excuse many things in the Transvaal\r\nbecause of the extreme provocation given by the Jameson Raid. The\r\nrestrictions upon English education are considered to be 'not\r\nunnatural when one remembers the violent attempt to swamp the Dutch.'\r\nThe excessive armaments are held to be 'entirely justifiable\r\nconsidering what has happened.' The building of forts is 'an ordinary\r\nprecaution.' The prohibiting of public meetings is 'quite wrong, of\r\ncourse, but can you wonder at it?' Many of these worthy people will,\r\nno doubt, learn with pained surprise that all these things were among\r\nthe causes which led to the Reform movement of 1895-6, and are not\r\nthe consequences of that movement as they erroneously suppose. The\r\nPress Law and Public Meetings Act had been passed; arms had been\r\nimported and ordered in tens of thousands; machine guns and\r\nquantities of ammunition also; forts were being built;{42} the\r\nsuppression of all private schools had been advocated by Dr.\r\nMansvelt--all long, long before the Jameson Raid. So also had the\r\nrepublican propaganda been at work, but it had not caught on outside\r\nthe two Republics.\r\n\r\nDifficult as his task might appear, Mr. Kruger had now command of the\r\ntwo great persuasive forces--money and sentiment. With the money he\r\npushed on the forts, and imported immense quantities of big guns,\r\nsmall arms, and ammunition--far in excess of what could possibly be\r\nused by the whole of the Boer population of the Transvaal after\r\nmaking every allowance for spare arms in reserve; and such an\r\nextraordinary supply was not unnaturally believed to be designed for\r\nthe use of others outside the Transvaal. More than this, an army of\r\nemissaries, agents, and spies in the pay of the Transvaal Government\r\nwere spread about the Free State, Cape Colony, and Natal. Newspapers\r\nwere supported in different parts of South Africa and a considerable\r\namount of money was spent upon the Press in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nIt would be absurd to suggest and it would be unjust to let it be\r\ninferred that all those who were drawn into sympathy with the Boers\r\nsupported or were even cognizant of President Kruger's ultimate aim.\r\nIt is an everyday experience that the scope of work and ambition\r\nexpands as one progresses. Whether the strong man really sees his\r\nultimate goal and tackles with magnificent courage the innumerable\r\nand seemingly insurmountable obstacles which lie between him and it,\r\nor whether in the wisdom and mercy of Providence there is such an\r\nadjustment of courage and foresight as prevents him from seeing more\r\nthan he is able to face, who can say? But what is beyond all doubt is\r\nthat, given the one strong man who does know his mind, he will lead\r\nas the Pied Piper led, and there is no thought in his following to\r\nask the whither and the why.\r\n\r\nGiven the sympathy and the means, the difficulty of President\r\nKruger's self-imposed task was not so great as at first appeared. To\r\nsome it was advisable to do no more than point to the Jameson Raid\r\nand say: 'We only wish to live in peace and to be left alone.' To\r\nsome again that act is construed as a sign that the British people\r\nwish to upset the two Republics, therefore they must strengthen and\r\nbe prepared. To others the appeal is made: 'We Dutch are the settlers\r\nand owners of the country, we wish for peace, of course, but we must\r\ndominate--you under your form of government, we under ours.'\r\nTo others again it is further advanced: 'Let us negotiate the\r\nelimination of the Imperial power; we do not suggest fight, but if we\r\npresent a united front they must retire peacefully and concede our\r\ndemands.' And lastly comes the appeal to those who are in sympathy\r\nwith the advanced republicans: 'Arm and prepare. Some day we shall\r\nfind England in a difficulty, divided by party or hampered by\r\nexternal complications; it has often happened before and we have\r\nalways profited. That will be our time to drive them out.'\r\n\r\nIt would be very unjust to some of the most prominent men on the\r\nDutch side in Cape Colony to leave the slenderest grounds for the\r\ninference that they are to be associated with the extreme and\r\nactively disloyal aim. All that it is intended to do is to indicate\r\nthe fine gradations in arguments by which a number are drawn\r\ntogether--under a leadership which they do not realize, and going\r\nthey know not where! The strongest of these arguments and appeals are\r\nparticularly popular with the younger generation of Dutch South\r\nAfricans who entertain a visionary scheme of independence suggested\r\nby the history of the United States. But there is something more\r\nserious in it than this, as may be deduced from the fact that in\r\nDecember, 1896, the writer was approached by Mr. D.P. Graaff,\r\nformerly a prominent member of the Cape Legislative Council and now\r\nas always a prominent Afrikander Bondsman, with the suggestion that\r\nall the South African born should combine in the effort to create the\r\nUnited States of South Africa, 'upon friendly terms with England, but\r\nconfining the direct Imperial right in South Africa to a naval\r\nbase at Simonstown and possibly a position in Natal.' This\r\nconcession--from South Africa to England--would not, it was argued,\r\ninvolve disadvantage to the former, because for a considerable time\r\nit would be necessary to preserve friendly relations with England and\r\nto have the protection of her fleet for the coast.\r\n\r\nIt is of course quite easy to attach too much importance to the\r\nopinions of individual politicians of this class, who are as a rule\r\nmerely shouters with the biggest crowd; but the prominent association\r\nof such an apostle of republicanism with the Bond, and the fact that\r\nhe should have gone so far with a Reformer of known strong British\r\nsympathies seem to warrant the attaching of some importance to the\r\nsuggestion.{43} A similar suggestion was made to several of the\r\nReformers at the time of the judicial crisis by one of the judges of\r\nthe Transvaal High Court, when it was hoped to enlist the sympathies\r\nof the Uitlanders with a movement to curtail President Kruger's power\r\nand to establish republicanism on a firmer basis in South Africa. In\r\norder to forestall an obvious comment, it may be said that discussion\r\nwas in both cases declined on the ground that it would be\r\nparticipating in politics in the sense forbidden by President\r\nKruger's three years' ban.\r\n\r\nThe year 1896 was a very bad one for the whole of South Africa.\r\nBesides the Raid and the suspense and disorganization entailed by the\r\nprolonged trial, the terrible dynamite explosion in Johannesburg,{44}\r\nthe still more terrible rebellion and massacre in Rhodesia, and the\r\ncrushing visitation of the great cattle scourge, the Rinderpest,\r\nhelped to produce a deplorable state of affairs in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nThen there was another thing which rankled badly: Messrs. Sampson and\r\nDavies were still in gaol.{45} The feeling throughout South Africa\r\nwas reflected in the monotonous announcement which appeared in the\r\n_Cape Times_ week by week for thirteen months:--'To-day Messrs.\r\nSampson and Davies complete the--week of their imprisonment in\r\nPretoria gaol for the crime of not signing a petition.' It seemed\r\nscarcely credible that the President should still harbour any\r\nillusions about his magnanimity; nevertheless, for some weeks before\r\nthe celebration of the Queen's Record reign it was rumoured that the\r\ntwo prisoners were to be released upon that occasion as a mark of his\r\nHonour's sympathy. Opinion had not been unanimous upon the attitude\r\nof either the President or the prisoners; but an ugly incident\r\nsilenced most of the President's apologists. Gold stealing and the\r\npurchase of stolen gold were being carried on such a scale and with\r\nsuch impunity that at last, in desperation, the directors and\r\nofficials of one of the big mining companies (the City and Suburban\r\nG.M. Co.), at the risk of being shot by desperadoes, took upon\r\nthemselves the functions of the detectives and police. They caught\r\n'red-handed' two notorious characters and delivered them over, with\r\nthe gold in their possession, to the authorities. The thieves\r\nactually boasted then that nothing would happen to them as they had\r\n'made it all right;' and a few days later one of them was allowed to\r\nescape out of the Court-house buildings which stand in the middle of\r\na large square. The other was convicted and sentenced to six months'\r\nimprisonment. He was a criminal of a bad and dangerous type, the head\r\nof a gang known to be concerned in gold stealing and burglary as a\r\nprofession. The penalty was regarded by all parties as most\r\ninadequate and the judge himself commented adversely upon the\r\ndrafting of the law which tended to screen the prisoner. Not one\r\nmitigating circumstance was forthcoming! And yet, whilst ignoring a\r\nfresh outburst of protest against the detention of Messrs. Sampson\r\nand Davies, and whilst the Industrial Commission was exposing the\r\ngold thefts and denouncing the complicity of the police, Mr. Kruger\r\ndecided to remit three-fourths of the sentence and to discharge\r\nthe thief unconditionally. Is it to be wondered that such ill-advised\r\naction called to mind the prisoners' boast, and that it was\r\ncontrasted prominently with the treatment of the two Reformers?\r\n\r\nThree events of importance marked the year 1897 in the history of the\r\nTransvaal. The first was the High Court crisis in February; the\r\nsecond, the appointment of the Industrial Commission of Inquiry; the\r\nthird, the Queen's Record Reign celebration.\r\n\r\nThe High Court crisis arose out of the case of Brown _v._ The State,\r\nalready referred to.{46} Brown had acted within his legal rights\r\naccording to the terms of a proclamation. That proclamation had been\r\nillegally withdrawn, and the Government realizing that they would\r\nhave to stand the consequences of their action in the courts of the\r\ncountry, introduced a law which was immediately passed by the\r\nVolksraad, absolving them from all liability, and practically\r\nnon-suiting all claimants. Mr. Kotzé in his judgment declared this\r\nlaw to be improper and in conflict with the Constitution, and gave\r\njudgment in favour of Brown, but left the amount of damages to be\r\ndetermined later after hearing further evidence.{47}\r\n\r\nThe first Volksraad was then in special session, and the President\r\npromptly introduced a law known as Law 1 of 1897, which empowered him\r\nto exact assurances from the judges that they would respect all\r\nresolutions of the Volksraad as having the force of law and declare\r\nthemselves not entitled to test the validity of a law by its\r\nagreement or conflict with the Constitution; and it further empowered\r\nthe President in the event of his not being satisfied with the\r\ncharacter of the replies to summarily dismiss the judges. The judges\r\nprotested in a body that they would not submit to such treatment. The\r\nHigh Court was adjourned and all legal business was stopped.\r\nParticularly emphatic was Mr. Justice Gregorowski. He stated that\r\nno honourable man could possibly sit upon the Transvaal Bench as long\r\nas Law 1 of 1897 remained upon the Statute Book. At this juncture Sir\r\nHenry de Villiers, Chief Justice of Cape Colony, came to Pretoria for\r\nthe purpose of effecting a compromise and averting a crisis. The\r\ncompromise was practically an armistice. The judges promised not to\r\nexercise the testing right pending the speedy introduction of a\r\nmeasure safeguarding the independence of the courts. Mr. Kruger on\r\nhis side promised to refrain from enforcing the provisions of Law 1\r\nof 1897, and undertook to introduce as speedily as possible the\r\nrequired new law.\r\n\r\nThe position in which the President found himself was undoubtedly one\r\nof some difficulty, but he chose a very bad way out of it.\r\nHigh-handed arbitrary methods cannot effect a permanent and\r\nsatisfactory solution of a question of that character, but Mr. Kruger\r\nwas unwilling to go to the root of the evil and to admit what Mr.\r\nKotzé's judgment had brought home with perhaps too sudden force,\r\nnamely, that the laws and system of Government were in a condition of\r\ncomplete chaos. The sequel can be told in a few words. In February,\r\n1898, Mr. Kotzé considered that ample time had been allowed by him\r\nfor the fulfilment of President Kruger's promise. Sir Henry de\r\nVilliers thought it proper to allow more time. The point of\r\ndifference between Mr. Kotzé and Sir Henry de Villiers was the\r\ninterpretation to be placed upon the expression 'this session,' which\r\nhad been used in the previous February when the President had said\r\nthat if he did not introduce the proposed measures this session, the\r\njudges might consider that he had failed to keep his promise. Mr.\r\nKotzé contended that as the Raad was then in session it meant _that\r\nSession_, and that in any case that session and another had passed,\r\nand a third was in progress and there was still no sign of the\r\npromised measures. Sir Henry de Villiers stated that in his opinion\r\nthe reasonable construction would be that Mr. Kruger meant the\r\nfollowing _ordinary_ session, and that only ordinary sessions could\r\nbe considered (for in each year there are one special and one\r\nordinary session), so that the President might be entitled to claim\r\nthe whole of the year 1898 within which to fulfil his promise, but\r\nthat this would be the extreme limit of forbearance, after which\r\nfailure could only be regarded as a breach of faith. Sir Henry de\r\nVilliers in fact defended Mr. Kruger. Mr. Kotzé, however, held to his\r\nopinion; he wrote to the President reminding him of the undertaking,\r\ncharged him with failure to keep his promise and withdrew the pledge\r\nwhich he had given. The President promptly exercised his right under\r\nLaw 1 of 1897, and dismissed Mr. Kotzé, who had served the country as\r\njudge and chief justice for over twenty years. Whatever the merits of\r\nthe particular case may be it appeared to be a shocking exhibition\r\nof arbitrary power to dismiss without compensation, pension, or\r\nprovision of any sort, a man no longer young, whose services had been\r\ngiven for nearly a quarter of a century, who in the extreme dilemma\r\nof the Raid had stood by the President, and who, from some points of\r\nview, must be admitted to have served him 'not wisely but too well.'\r\n\r\nMr. Kotzé was not at that time popular among the Uitlanders on\r\naccount of his action in the matter of the Reformers, and especially\r\nbecause he had acted on behalf of the Government in securing the\r\nservices of Mr. Gregorowski for the Reform trial; but the\r\ncircumstances of his dismissal and the fact that he was known to be\r\ndependent upon his salary as judge, taken in conjunction with the\r\ncourageous stand which he had made against the President's arbitrary\r\nwill, enlisted public sympathy on his behalf, and a purse amounting\r\nin all to about £6,000 was presented to him as a mark of appreciation\r\nfor his past services. But then followed the 'most unkindest cut of\r\nall.' Mr. Gregorowski, who had resigned a judgeship in order to fill\r\nthe post of State Attorney when Dr. Coster, in consequence of an\r\ninsulting reference of the President's to his countrymen,\r\nrelinquished it,--Mr. Gregorowski, who had been foremost to declare\r\nthat no honourable man could possibly accept the position of judge\r\nwhile Law 1 of 1897 stood on the Statute Book, became Chief Justice\r\n_vice_ Mr. Kotzé dismissed. And by way of finally disposing of the\r\nsubject, the President when questioned in the Raad as to the\r\nexplanation of his apologist, denied that he had ever made any\r\npromise of any sort or description to Sir Henry de Villiers or\r\nanybody else!\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Ameshof, who with Mr. Kotzé had made a stand against the\r\nPresident in this matter, was also obliged to relinquish his\r\njudgeship. Thus it will be seen that at one swoop Mr. Kruger disposed\r\nof three reputable intermediaries whom he had used to great advantage\r\nat one time or another. 'Something for nothing,' for Mr. Kruger!\r\nWhether Mr. Kotzé acted in haste or whether Sir Henry de Villiers'\r\nplea for more time was justified are questions which it is no longer\r\nnecessary to discuss, not alone because Mr. Kruger denied ever having\r\nmade the promise out of which the disagreement arose, but because\r\neven up to the present time no measure safeguarding the High Court\r\nhas been introduced or foreshadowed in the legislature. And Law 1 of\r\n1897, which according to Mr. Gregorowski made it impossible for any\r\nhonourable man to sit upon the Bench, is still upon the Statute Book\r\nand Mr. Gregorowski sits as Chief Justice subject to its provisions.\r\n\r\nNo one disputes that the position of the High Court as determined by\r\nLaw 1 of 1897 is a very unsatisfactory one, but the apologists for\r\nPresident Kruger frequently say that there has been no actual case of\r\nhardship, and that the Uitlanders are crying out before they are\r\nhurt. They maintain that it was a measure passed under great\r\nprovocation for a particular purpose, and that the power granted\r\nunder it, although very undesirable in principle, has never been\r\nused. This is incorrect; the power has been used, and injustice has\r\nbeen suffered. Two cases of actual hardship are those of Brown _v._\r\nGovernment, the case out of which the whole matter arose, and the\r\ncase of the Pretoria Waterworks Company. But there are other cases\r\ntoo which have never been brought into court having been either\r\ncompromised or abandoned because of the hopelessness of the position,\r\nfor it is obvious that there would be great reluctance on the part of\r\nbusiness men to make a fight merely for the purpose of showing that\r\nthey suffered under a disability when the result of such a fight\r\nwould inevitably be to antagonize the only tribunal to which they\r\ncould appeal.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Pretoria Waterworks Company is rather a bad one. The\r\nGovernment in 1889 gave a contract for the water supply of Pretoria.\r\nIt was a permission, but not an exclusive right, to supply the\r\ntown from springs on Government ground. The President, finding that\r\nthe contractor was not in a position to undertake the work, requested\r\ncertain business houses to form a company to acquire this right and\r\nto supply the town with water. After inquiry into the local\r\nconditions and the probable costs, these people represented that\r\nunless they received the exclusive right they would be unable to\r\nundertake the work, as the cost of importing pipes and machinery\r\ntransported from Natal by bullock waggon and the then expensive\r\nconditions of working would make the work so costly that at a later\r\nperiod, after the introduction of railways, it would be possible for\r\ncompetitors, such for instance as the projected Municipality of\r\nPretoria, to establish a system of water supply at probably half the\r\ncost of the first one and thus compete to their disadvantage. For\r\nthese reasons the contractor and his friends declined to proceed with\r\nthe formation of the company. The President, however, was very\r\ndesirous of having a good water supply, and after some months of\r\nnegotiations the original contract was supplemented by a grant from\r\nthe Executive Council, who then held plenary powers from the\r\nVolksraad, giving the proposed company the exclusive right.\r\nImmediately after the receipt of this grant the company was formed,\r\nthe capital subscribed and the machinery and other material\r\npurchased. In 1898, after nine years of work, during which\r\nshareholders had received dividends averaging 2-2/3 per cent. per\r\nannum, some differences occurred between the Company and the\r\nconsumers, and the latter combined and subscribed the necessary funds\r\nto take action in the High Court, the object being to challenge the\r\nexclusive right and to enable the town through its Municipality to\r\nprovide its own supply. At the same time the Government at the\r\ninstance of the townspeople opened negotiations with the Company with\r\na view to expropriation in accordance with the terms stipulated in\r\nthe original contract. While matters were in this position, however,\r\ncertain members of the Volksraad prominently concerned in the action\r\nagainst the Company, introduced a measure in the Volksraad cancelling\r\nthe second or exclusive grant made by the Government nine years\r\nbefore and recommending that the Government should either buy out\r\nthe Waterworks Company upon suitable terms or should give the\r\nnecessary facilities to the Town Council to introduce another system\r\nof supply. The application of the Company to be allowed to state its\r\ncase was ignored, and after a short discussion the resolution was\r\npassed and the measure became law. By the action of the Volksraad the\r\nCompany was deprived of that principal asset upon the security of\r\nwhich the capital had been subscribed, and the Government were\r\nrescued from an awkward position. The Government took no steps to\r\ndefend their action in granting the right or to protest against the\r\naction of the Volksraad, and became, therefore, parties to an act of\r\npiracy. The Company were thus placed entirely at the mercy of the\r\nGovernment, for under the provisions of Law 1 of 1897, the Volksraad\r\nresolution put them out of court both as to upholding their title and\r\nclaiming damages. All doubts as to the Government's complicity in\r\nthis action were removed when upon negotiations being opened for the\r\nexpropriation of the Company the Government refused to follow the\r\nprocedure prescribed in the contract on the ground that as the\r\nCompany had now lost the exclusive right they must accept a less sum\r\nin compensation, otherwise the Government would authorise the rival\r\nMunicipal scheme. Under these circumstances the shareholders having\r\nno other power to appeal to adopted the common-sense course of taking\r\nwhat they could get. The result can only be expressed in figures. The\r\nshares, which had been purchased at over 40s. at the time of the\r\nVolksraad's action were worth less than 28s. in liquidation. The\r\ninquiry into the Raid by the Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, early in 1897, was productive of a result which is not\r\nalways traced to its real cause. The greatest dissatisfaction was\r\nexpressed in the Transvaal and among all the Boers in South Africa\r\nwith one feature of the Westminster inquiry, viz., the investigation\r\nof the causes which made the Raid possible. Mr. Kruger and his\r\nfriends had enjoyed such a run of luck and so much indulgence, and\r\nhad been so successful in presenting their side of the case only,\r\nthat it seemed to them improper that anyone should wish to inquire\r\ninto all the circumstances. It would even appear from what\r\nfollowed that the President had convinced himself that there were no\r\ngrievances, that he was an entirely innocent party deeply injured by\r\nthe Reformers and the British Government, and that the Westminster\r\ninquiry had been authorized and conducted for the sole purpose of\r\nexposing him and justifying the Reform movement.\r\n\r\nAs the months dragged on and no improvement in the conditions of the\r\nUitlanders took place, as indeed the complaints grew louder and the\r\nstate of affairs grew worse, the President again began to hear the\r\nvoices calling for reform. Timid whispers they were, perhaps, and far\r\nbetween, for the great bulk of the Uitlanders were in a morose and\r\nsullen mood. Having tried and failed on stronger lines they were\r\nincapable as yet of returning with any heart to the old fruitless and\r\nalready rejected constitutional methods. The suggestions for reform,\r\nconsequently, came principally from those who were on friendly terms\r\nwith the Boer party and believed themselves to carry some weight.\r\nThey have by this time learned that nobody carries weight with\r\nPresident Kruger unless he has power to back his suggestions. Many\r\nyears before, the late Mr. W.Y. Campbell as spokesman of a deputation\r\nfrom Johannesburg, addressing President Kruger, stated in the course\r\nof his remarks that the people of Johannesburg 'protested' against a\r\ncertain measure. The President jumped up in one of his characteristic\r\nmoods and said: 'Protest! Protest!! what is the good of protesting?\r\nYou have not got the guns! I have.' And Mr. Campbell, in reporting\r\nthis in Johannesburg, remarked: 'That man is sensible; he knows the\r\nposition. I claim to be sensible also, and I know he is right: you\r\ncan take my name off any other deputations, for we'll get nothing by\r\nasking.'\r\n\r\nIt is stated, and the statement comes from one who claims to have\r\nbeen the father of the suggestion, that the President was induced to\r\nappoint a commission of inquiry by the argument that if, as he\r\nbelieved, the wretched state of affairs in Johannesburg was due not\r\nto the action of the Government but to the greed, machinations, and\r\nmismanagement of the capitalists, nothing could suit the latter worse\r\nthan to be taken at their word and to have a commission appointed to\r\ntake evidence on oath and to publicly inquire into the state of\r\naffairs; in fact to copy the Westminster inquiry. It is\r\nconceivable that the resolute refusal to investigate matters or to\r\nlisten to complaints or explanations which the President had\r\nthroughout maintained may have been the means of preserving a\r\nblissful faith in the strength of his own case and the rottenness of\r\nthe Uitlanders'; at any rate, it seems to be an undoubted fact that\r\nthe Industrial Commission of Inquiry, which was appointed by the\r\nExecutive at the request of the President, was appointed in the\r\nconfident belief that it would shift the burden of responsibility\r\nfrom his shoulders to those of the capitalists. This construction of\r\nhis motives may appear to be severe and perhaps even unfair, but it\r\nis entirely borne out by the manner in which he dealt with the report\r\nof the Industrial Commission, fighting against its acceptance,\r\nignoring the recommendations of relief, and even imposing fresh\r\nburdens. There is, nevertheless, one thing to be deduced which is in\r\na manner to Mr. Kruger's credit, and that is that he really must have\r\nbelieved that the case would--from his point of view--bear inquiring\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Commission with power to vote were Messrs. Schalk\r\nW. Burger, Member of the Executive Council (Chairman); J.S. Smit,\r\nGovernment Railway Commissioner; Christiaan Joubert, Minister of\r\nMines; Schmitz-Dumont, Acting State Mining Engineer; and J.F. de\r\nBeer, first special Judicial Commissioner, Johannesburg. Mr. Thos.\r\nHugo, the General Manager of the National Bank, was appointed\r\nfinancial adviser, and certain advisory members were arbitrarily\r\nselected by the Government. The complete exclusion of all those who\r\nhad had any direct or indirect association with the late Reform\r\nmovement or with those in any way connected with it strengthened the\r\nconviction that the Government designed the Commission to be a\r\nwhitewashing one; but whatever the design may have been it would be\r\ndoing an injustice both to the Government officials and to the\r\nadvisory members to have it supposed that they were parties to such\r\nan idea. They were not; they did their work admirably, and no inquiry\r\ncould have been conducted in a better spirit. This, however, was not\r\nforeseen, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the Uitlanders\r\nwere induced to view the thing seriously and to realize that, no\r\nmatter how it had occurred, this was a supreme opportunity for\r\nproving to the world the soundness of their case. The report and\r\nproceedings are published by the Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines in a\r\nvolume containing over 700 pages of printed matter and a number of\r\ndiagrams. The whole constitutes a damning indictment of the\r\nGovernment, as the following extracts from the report of the\r\nCommission testify:--\r\n\r\nYour Commission are pleased to state that at present there exist all\r\nthe indications of an honest administration, and the State, as well\r\nas the Mining Industry, must be congratulated upon the fact that most\r\nof the mines are controlled and directed by financial and practical\r\nmen who devote their time, energy, and knowledge to the mining\r\nindustry, and who have not only introduced the most up-to-date\r\nmachinery and mining appliances, but also the greatest perfection of\r\nmethod and process known to science. But for these a good many of the\r\nmines now producing gold would not have reached that stage....\r\n\r\nTo avoid such a calamity (viz., the closing down of the mines) your\r\nCommission are of opinion that it is the duty of the Government to\r\nco-operate with the mining industry, and to devise means in order to\r\nmake it possible for lower-grade mines to work at a profit, and\r\ngenerally to lighten the burdens of the mining industry. This and the\r\ndevelopment and equipment of the new mines are a few examples among\r\nothers where it is desirable that the Government shall take an active\r\npart, especially when the fact is taken into consideration that up\r\ntill now the mining industry must be held as the financial basis,\r\nsupport, and mainstay of the State.\r\n\r\nThe question, therefore, becomes one of national economy, and it is\r\nincumbent upon the Government, considering the rapid growth and\r\nprogress of the country, to so alter its fiscal laws and systems of\r\nadministration as to meet the requirements of its principal\r\nindustry....\r\n\r\nYour Commission entirely disapprove of concessions, through which the\r\nindustrial prosperity of the country is hampered. Such might have\r\nbeen expedient in the past, but the country has now arrived at a\r\nstate of development that will only admit of free competition\r\naccording to republican principles. This applies more especially to\r\nthe gold industry, which has to face its own economical problems\r\nwithout being further burdened with concessions that are irksome and\r\ninjurious to the industry and will always remain a source of\r\nirritation and dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAs to white labour:--\r\n\r\nYour Commission are of opinion that wages are not excessive, regard\r\nbeing had to the high cost of living at the mines. In fact, they are\r\nonly sufficient to satisfy daily wants, and, consequently, it cannot\r\nbe expected that white labourers will establish their permanent abode\r\nin this Republic unless conditions are made by which their position\r\nwill be ameliorated....\r\n\r\nYour Commission are of opinion that as long as the cost of living\r\ncannot be considerably reduced it will be almost impossible to reduce\r\nthe wages of white labourers, and they would strongly recommend that,\r\nas far as possible, necessaries of life should be imported free of\r\nduty and conveyed to the mines as cheaply as possible.\r\n\r\nAs to the sale of liquor:--\r\n\r\nIt has been proved to your Commission that the Liquor Law is not\r\ncarried out properly, and that the mining industry has real\r\ngrievances in connection therewith, owing to the illicit sale of\r\nstrong drink to the natives at the mines, and they wish especially\r\nand strongly to insist that the stipulations of article 16 of the law\r\nshall be strictly enforced. The evidence given on this point proves\r\nthat a miserable state of affairs exists, and a much stronger\r\napplication of the law is required.\r\n\r\nFollowing this there is a long criticism with recommendations in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nAs to import duties:--\r\n\r\nWith reference to this matter, your Commission can only recommend\r\nthat, if possible, foodstuffs ought to be entirely free from\r\ntaxation, as at the present moment it is impossible to supply the\r\npopulation of the Republic from the products of local agriculture and\r\nconsequently importation is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAs to explosives:--\r\n\r\nBefore entering on this subject, we wish to put on record our\r\ndisappointment with the evidence tendered on behalf of the South\r\nAfrican Explosives Company, Ltd. We expected, and we think not\r\nunreasonably, that they would be able to give reliable information\r\nfor our guidance respecting the cost of importation, as well as of\r\nlocal manufacture, of the principal explosives used for mining\r\npurposes; but, though persistently questioned on these points, few\r\nfacts were elicited and we regret to say that they entirely failed to\r\nsatisfy us in this important respect....\r\n\r\nThat the principal explosives used here can be purchased in Europe,\r\nand delivered here at a price far below the present cost to the\r\nmines, has been proved to us by the evidence of many witnesses\r\ncompetent to speak on the subject, and when we bear in mind that the\r\nexcess charge of 40s. to 45s. per case does not benefit the State,\r\nbut serves to enrich individuals for the most part resident in\r\nEurope, the injustice of such a tax on the staple industry becomes\r\nmore apparent and demands immediate removal.\r\n\r\nAfter showing that the dynamite monopolists make a profit of 47s. 6d.\r\nper case on No. 1 dynamite, and 55s. on blasting gelatine, over and\r\nabove the price at which the mines could buy explosives if there were\r\nno monopoly or protection, the report goes on:--\r\n\r\nThe Mining Industry has thus to bear a burden which does not enrich\r\nthe State or bring any benefit in return, and this fact must always\r\nprove a source of irritation and annoyance to those who, while\r\nwilling to contribute to just taxation for the general good, cannot\r\nacquiesce in an impost of the nature complained of....\r\n\r\nYour Commission inspected the factory at Modderfontein, and it must\r\nbe admitted that the construction of the works and general equipment\r\nare in many respects admirable, and it appears to us greatly to be\r\nregretted that so much money should have been invested in an\r\nundertaking for the manufacture of any article whereof the\r\ningredients have to be imported at a great cost, four tons of raw\r\nmaterial being required to produce one ton of the manufactured\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved to our satisfaction that none of the raw material\r\nused is found in this country, or only in such small quantities as to\r\nmake it practically valueless for the purpose required.... All these\r\ndrawbacks, which make it almost impossible to establish a bonâ-fide\r\nindustry, fall on the mines and render their task, especially that of\r\nthe low-grade mines, extremely difficult and discouraging. Another\r\npoint that has been brought to the notice of your Commission is the\r\nprejudicial effect exercised by this monopoly in practically\r\nexcluding from the country all new inventions in connection with\r\nexplosives, and, in view of the numerous dynamite accidents that have\r\ntaken place from time to time, it is to be regretted that it is not\r\npossible to make satisfactory trials of other and less dangerous\r\nexplosives for the working of the mines. These questions have\r\nreceived the careful consideration of your Commission, who are forced\r\nto the conclusion that the factory has not attained the object for\r\nwhich it was established, and that there is no reasonable prospect of\r\nit doing so. Further, that there are good grounds for believing that\r\nthe contractors have failed to comply with the conditions of their\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nFor the aforesaid reasons, and in view of the opinion expressed by\r\nthe Volksraad Dynamite Commission, that the legal position of the\r\nGovernment against the contractors is undoubtedly strong, your\r\nCommission desire to recommend that the case be placed in the hands\r\nof the legal advisers of the State, with a view to ascertaining\r\nwhether the contract cannot be cancelled.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile your Commission recommend that the Government avail itself\r\nforthwith of its right under Article 15 of the Regulations, to take\r\naway the agency of trading in gunpowder, dynamite, cartridges, and\r\nother explosives from the above-mentioned persons and at once take\r\ninto its own hands the importation of dynamite and other explosives\r\nfor the benefit of the mining industry, subject to a duty of not more\r\nthan 20s. per case or such other less sum as may be determined from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nThis protective duty, while considerably increasing the revenue of\r\nthe State, will at the same time offer ample protection to any\r\nindustry of this description in the Republic. In the event of\r\ncancellation being advised to be possible, free trade in explosives\r\nto be at once established, subject to a duty of 20s. per case or such\r\nother less duty as may be determined upon from time to time, and\r\nmanufacturing of other explosives in the Republic to be allowed, and\r\nalso to be protected by the same import duty....\r\n\r\nYour Commission desire further to observe that it is not clear to\r\nthem, judging from the published accounts of the South African\r\nExplosives Company for 1895 and 1896, that the Government receives\r\nthe proportion of surplus profit secured to it under the contract,\r\nviz., 20 per cent., and would strongly recommend, in accordance\r\nwith Article 6 of the contract, an immediate investigation of the\r\nCompany's accounts by qualified accountants, in conjunction with the\r\nfinancial adviser of the Commission, in order to find out what amount\r\nis still due to the Government under this head.\r\n\r\nAs to railways:--\r\n\r\nYour Commission have followed with great attention and interest the\r\nevidence and statistics submitted on this point. From those it\r\nappears that not only are the tariffs charged by the Netherlands\r\nRailway Company such that by the reduction of the same the industry\r\nwould be considerably benefited, but that such a reduction would\r\nnecessitate that the neighbouring States and Colonies would also have\r\nto reduce their tariffs considerably.\r\n\r\nYour Commission have come to the conclusion that, taking into\r\nconsideration the evidence submitted to them, and taking the gross\r\nrevenue of traffic of goods at about £2,000,000 (as in 1896) it would\r\nbe desirable to recommend so to regulate the tariff that the gross\r\nrevenue for 1896 would have been reduced by £500,000, equivalent to\r\nan average reduction of 25 per cent. Further, your Commission deem it\r\ndesirable that the Government shall make such arrangement as will\r\nsecure to them in the future a voice in the fixing of the tariffs of\r\nthe N.Z.A.S.M., and express their confidence that as soon as\r\nprosperous times will warrant such a course a further reduction in\r\ntariffs will be effected. Your Commission wish to recommend that the\r\nreduction will be chiefly applied to traffic of coal, timber, mining\r\nmachinery, and foodstuffs, according to a scale to be agreed upon\r\nbetween the Government and the N.Z.A.S.M. Your Commission are of\r\nopinion that in this manner the industry will be met in a very fair\r\nway. Your Commission wish to express the opinion that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that the reduction in all local tariffs will be\r\nbrought about as speedily as possible, while they express the hope\r\nthat where the co-operation of the neighbouring States and Colonies\r\nis required, negotiations will be initiated and carried out so\r\nspeedily that the reductions to be so initiated will come into force\r\nnot later than 1st January next. Several witnesses and some of the\r\nCommission have urged the expropriation of the N.Z.A.S.M. by the\r\nGovernment. Your Commission, however, for several reasons known to\r\nthem, and after same have been communicated to those members of the\r\nCommission who wished to urge the expropriation of the N.Z.A.S.M., do\r\nnot at the present moment desire to urge expropriation provided by\r\nthe other means terms can be secured from the Company so as to obtain\r\nthe reduction at present urgently required on the basis as above set\r\nforth. Your Commission have been informed that the Company have\r\nproposed to adopt the dividends of the three years 1895, 1896, and\r\n1897 as a basis for the expropriation price, and your Commission can\r\nagree to such proposal. The expropriation price being thus fixed, the\r\nCompany will have all the more reason to co-operate towards the\r\nlowering of the tariffs. Further, it appears from the evidence of the\r\nmanaging director of the N.Z.A.S.M., that in consideration of the\r\nreduction of tariffs, he wished to have secured to the Company a\r\ncertain period of existence. Your Commission cannot recommend this\r\ncourse, because they do not deem the same to be in the interests of\r\nthe State, and it would be contrary to the wishes of the public.\r\n\r\nAs to gold thefts:--\r\n\r\nAccording to the evidence submitted to your Commission, gold thefts\r\nare on the increase, and although the Volksraad has given the matter\r\ntheir favourable consideration, and have, at the instance of the\r\nMining Industry, so amended the Gold Law as to provide for the\r\npunishment of the sale and being in possession of raw gold, still it\r\nhas been stated to your Commission in evidence, that the gold thefts\r\namount to about 10 per cent. of the output, equivalent to an amount\r\nof £750,000 per annum. It follows that the administration of the law\r\nmust be faulty, because there are only very few instances where the\r\ncrime has been detected and punished. If those figures are not\r\nexaggerated, and your Commission have no reason to suppose so, then\r\nthis matter deserves the serious consideration of the Government. The\r\nsuppression of this crime can be considered as a real saving to the\r\nindustry, and this amount of three-quarters of a million would,\r\nespecially in times of depression, exercise a large influence on the\r\nyield and financial position of the mines. The industry ask that the\r\npenal clauses regarding this matter shall be eliminated from the Gold\r\nLaw, and that a separate law be passed, more or less on the basis of\r\nthe I.D.B. Law of Kimberley, Cape Colony, and that measures shall be\r\ntaken by which the injured parties shall be enabled to exercise\r\ncontrol, and have supervision over any department to be established\r\nfor the detection and suppression of thefts of new gold. Your\r\nCommission are of opinion that the Government could grant this\r\nrequest without injuring their dignity, on the basis hereinafter\r\nmentioned. On the contrary, it would remove the blame from the\r\npresent administration, viz., that these thefts can be practically\r\ncarried on with impunity.\r\n\r\nAs to the Local Board:--\r\n\r\nThe evidence which has been laid before your Commission has contained\r\nsuggestions to establish a Board on which Government nominees and\r\nrepresentatives of the mining industry and of the commercial\r\ncommunity of the Witwatersrand should sit, so that the Government\r\nrepresentatives should have the benefit of the experience of men\r\nwhose daily occupation it is to look closely into all the affairs\r\nappertaining to the mines, &c. Your Commission is of opinion that it\r\nis advisable that these suggestions should be acted upon. The scope\r\nof this Board should consist of the supervision of the administration\r\nof the following laws, viz.:--\r\n\r\nThe Liquor Law as far as it concerns the proclaimed goldfields, the\r\nPass Law, and the Law relating to Gold Thefts; and the Board will\r\nfurther have an advisory voice in the supply of natives to the mines,\r\nwhich your Commission has recommended your Government to take into\r\nits own hands. The area under the surveillance of the Board should\r\ninclude the Heidelberg, Witwatersrand, and Klerksdorp districts, and\r\nother goldfields as may be found desirable hereafter. Your Commission\r\nsuggests that the Board consists of the following: Five members to be\r\nappointed by the Government, and four delegates to be appointed by\r\nthe following bodies, with the consent of the Government, viz., one\r\ndelegate of the Chamber of Mines, one of the Association of Mines (or\r\nin case of an amalgamation, two representatives of the new Chamber),\r\na nominee of the Mine Managers' Association, and a nominee of the\r\ncommercial community of Johannesburg. Your Commission would advise\r\nthat a separate detective force be placed under the department, whose\r\nduty it should be to detect any infringements of the above-mentioned\r\nlaws, and to bring the offenders to justice in the ordinary course of\r\nlaw. It should also be in the sphere of the Board's work to report to\r\nthe proper authorities any laxity on the part of the officials who\r\nhave to administer the above-mentioned laws. The Board is to report\r\nto the Executive Council upon the working of the laws referred to,\r\nand to suggest alterations. It must be well understood that the power\r\nof this Board must in no way clash with the sphere of the Minister of\r\nthe Mines department and the Licensing Board, but co-operate with the\r\nsame. We should adduce as a reason the more for the creation of such\r\na Board that Government could depute to them the right to receive\r\ndeputations, hear their arguments, and report to the Government on\r\nthe subject, whereby a great saving of time would be the result. We\r\nwould recommend that the Commission be appointed at once, and that\r\nthey shall frame their proposals for regulations and submit them at\r\nonce to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a local mining board has been strongly urged by\r\nwitnesses. From an industrial and financial point of view this\r\ncountry must be considered as still in its infancy, and, without loss\r\nof dignity or prestige, the Government may accede to the above\r\nrequest. Experience in these matters can only be attained after the\r\nlapse of long years, and by coming in contact with experts from other\r\ncountries the State will reap the benefit of the knowledge obtained\r\nin their country, where these problems have for decades exercised the\r\nminds of their leading citizens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, your Commission fervently hope that they have truly\r\nand faithfully interpreted the object of the inquiry, and that their\r\nsuggestions and recommendations, if acted upon, will confer a lasting\r\nbenefit on the country and people.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, as has been stated, was all given on oath, and some\r\nvery interesting details came out. In one case Dr. Leyds's system of\r\nmisrepresentation was exposed. Whilst the Commission was actually\r\ntaking evidence the then State Secretary in an interview with the\r\nParis _Temps_ strongly supported the dynamite monopoly, and stated\r\nthat the price charged, namely, 90s. per case, was the same at which\r\nthe Chamber of Mines had offered to enter into a sixteen years'\r\ncontract with Nobel's factory. A witness questioned on this point\r\nexplained that this was quite true as regards price, but that Dr.\r\nLeyds had suppressed the essential fact that whereas out of the 90s.\r\npaid to the monopolists the Government only receive 5s. by way of\r\nduty, they would out of the 90s. which it was proposed to pay for\r\nNobel's dynamite receive no less than 38s. per case as duty, and that\r\nif the contract proposed by the Chamber had been made the Government\r\nwould have profited during the previous four years to the extent of\r\n£1,200,000 instead of £150,000. Upon another occasion light was\r\nthrown on dark places in a rather disconcerting fashion. Mr.\r\nChristiaan Joubert, Minister of Mines, took one of the witnesses in\r\nhand with the object of showing that the people of Johannesburg had\r\nonly themselves to thank for the loss of confidence in this business.\r\nThe following questions and answers are from the official report:--\r\n\r\nShould not the Chamber of Mines co-operate with the Department of\r\nMines to get a law protecting European shareholders from being\r\ndefrauded by swindlers?--I don't know if such a law could be framed\r\nwithout interfering with what, in other countries, is considered to\r\nbe personal liberty. You have to come to the point whether the man\r\nintended to swindle, and that can only be settled by the Court, as a\r\nmatter of personal judgment. If a good law could be devised it would\r\nbe beneficial.\r\n\r\nIs there no possibility for the Chamber of Mines to work with the\r\nDepartment for the passing of such a law?--I don't know if laws exist\r\nin France, Germany, England, or America, to that specific effect; but\r\nif so, I would be guided by the wisdom and immense experience of the\r\nlaw makers of those countries, otherwise we might be rushing in where\r\nangels fear to tread.\r\n\r\nIs it then possible? Are you willing to discuss the matter with\r\nus?--Oh, yes; but I do not think that that is exactly what is wanted\r\nin order to restore confidence. Lots of things combine to shake the\r\nconfidence of investors. For instance, to deal with some small and\r\nhomely matters, I was told by a member of the Sanitary Board\r\nyesterday that an application for the underground rights of the\r\nMarket Square, had been made by Mr. Jan Meyer, a leading member of\r\nthe Volksraad. That does not help to restore confidence. The Sanitary\r\nBoard applied for a portion of the Telephone Tower Park in order to\r\nerect a Town Hall. They were refused. Now, some one has made an\r\napplication for the right to erect swimming baths. That does not\r\nrestore confidence. I hope the mere publication of these things will\r\nprevent them from succeeding. The Sanitary Board applied for the\r\nUnion Ground, also for public purposes, but it was granted to private\r\napplicants on the quiet. They have hawked it about and borrowed money\r\non it. It was offered to many of the big capitalists here, but they\r\nwould not touch it. The Sanitary Board are told that a building is to\r\nbe put up, in which fifty rooms will be set aside for them, but they\r\nare not satisfied that the authorities should do good by stealth and\r\nblush to find it fame.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand how mere applications can shake\r\nconfidence?--Well, they do, because they are only made when there is\r\na chance of their being granted. But, if you want facts, I will tell\r\nyou what shook the investor's confidence as much as anything that has\r\nhappened for years--that was the Ferreira claim-jumping raid, which\r\nit was sworn to in Court had been suggested by you yourself, Mr.\r\nJoubert.\r\n\r\nNot 'suggested' by me--\r\n\r\nThe Chairman said the witness was straying away from the original\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWitness said that the Minister of Mines had wanted examples of what\r\nshook confidence, so he was obliged to give them.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commission created a very favourable impression.\r\nThe majority of people believed that although it might not be\r\nentirely acted upon, yet it would be quite impossible for the\r\nPresident and the Volksraad to disregard suggestions made by so\r\ninfluential a group of officials as those forming the Commission, and\r\nthat at any rate most of the recommendations would be accepted. The\r\nunbelieving few who knew their President Kruger, however, waited for\r\nsomething to be _done_. Presently ominous rumours went round about\r\ndifferences in the Executive. Then came the scenes in the Volksraad,\r\nwhen the President revealed himself and charged Mr. Schalk Burger\r\nwith being a traitor to his country for having signed such a report,\r\nfollowed by the usual fight and the usual victory for the President,\r\nand the usual Committee constituted mainly of extreme Conservatives\r\nappointed to report upon the other Commission's report; and then the\r\nusual result: Something for nothing. The Netherlands Railway made an\r\ninconsiderable reduction in rates, which it appears was designed to\r\nbuy off, and did succeed in buying off, further scrutiny of its\r\naffairs. With regard to the two big monopolies, Dynamite and Railway,\r\nit appears that the Volksraad Commission accepted the private\r\nassurances of the monopolists as sufficient warrant for reversing the\r\nconclusions of the Industrial Commission. The proposed Local Board\r\nfor the goldfields was promptly ruled out as an unthinkable\r\nproposition, a government within a government, and was so denounced\r\nby the President himself. But the report of the Volksraad\r\nCommittee contained one supreme stroke of humour. It adopted the\r\nrecommendations of the Industrial Commission to remit the duties upon\r\ncertain articles of consumption so as to make living cheaper, but as\r\na condition it stipulated that in order that the State revenue should\r\nnot suffer, the duty upon other articles of consumption should be\r\nincreased so as to rather more than counterbalance the loss. That was\r\none result which the Uitlanders had in the beginning confidently\r\nexpected: Something for nothing. But the other result upon which they\r\nhad also calculated was a valuable one. They had put their case on\r\nrecord and for the future the task of justifying the Uitlanders'\r\ncause was to be reduced to the formality of pointing to the\r\nIndustrial Commission's report.\r\n\r\nThe third event of importance, and an event of much greater\r\nimportance than has generally been recognised, was the Queen's Record\r\nReign celebration in Johannesburg. 'Britons, hold up your heads !'\r\nwas the watchword with which the late Mr. W. Y. Campbell started to\r\norganize what he eventually carried out as the biggest and most\r\nenthusiastic demonstration ever made in the country. No more\r\nunselfish and loyal subject of her Majesty ever set foot in South\r\nAfrica than Mr. Campbell, whose organization and example to 'Rand\r\nBritons,' as he called them, did more to hearten up British subjects\r\nin the Transvaal than has ever been fully realized or properly\r\nacknowledged. The celebration was an immense success in itself, and\r\nbesides restoring the hopes and spirits of British subjects it\r\npromoted generally a better feeling and a disposition to forget past\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of the Raid and Reform had been a split in\r\nthe Chamber of Mines caused by the secession of a minority who held\r\nviews strongly opposed to those of the Reform party. It has always\r\nbeen the policy of the Government to endeavour to divide the Rand\r\ncommunity. This is no vague general charge: many instances can be\r\ngiven extending over a number of years. The accidental revelations in\r\na police court showed that in 1891 the Government were supporting\r\nfrom the Secret Service Funds certain individuals with the object of\r\narranging labour unions to coerce employers upon various points. The\r\nmovement was a hopeless failure because the working men declined to\r\nhave anything to do with the so-called leaders. When the split took\r\nplace in the Chamber of Mines, it became the business of Dr. Leyds\r\nand the President to keep the rift open. This was done persistently\r\nand in a very open manner--the seceders being informed upon several\r\noccasions that a fusion of the two Chambers would not be welcome to\r\nthe Government. Both before and since that time the same policy has\r\nfound expression in the misleading statement made on behalf of the\r\nGovernment upon the compound question (namely, that the companies\r\nwere aiming at compounding all the natives and monopolizing all\r\nthe trade of the Rand), a statement made to divide the mercantile\r\nfrom the mining community. The fostering of the liquor industry with\r\nits thousands of disreputable hangers-on is another example; the\r\nanti-capitalist campaign carried on by the Government press another.\r\nAnd the most flagrant of all of course is the incitement to race\r\nhatred. _Divide et impera_, is a principle which they apply with\r\nunfailing regularity whether in their relations with other countries,\r\nin the government of their own State, or in their dealings with\r\nprivate individuals. Happily for the Rand community the effort to\r\nsettle their internal differences was successful; towards the end of\r\n1897 the fusion of the two mining chambers took place, and the\r\nunanimity thus restored has not since been disturbed.\r\n\r\nBy this time even the most enthusiastic and sanguine friends of the\r\nGovernment had to some extent realized the meaning of the 'something\r\nfor nothing' policy. They began to take count of all that they had\r\ndone to please Mr. Kruger, and were endeavouring to find out what\r\nthey had got in return. The result, as they were disposed to admit,\r\nwas that for all the good it had done them they might as well have\r\nhad the satisfaction of speaking their minds frankly as the others\r\nhad done. The Raad's treatment of the Industrial Commission report\r\nhad estranged all those who had taken part in the deliberations of\r\nthe Commission, and as Mr. Kruger had been careful to select only\r\nthose whom he believed to be friendly to him he suffered more in the\r\nrecoil than he would otherwise have done. He fell into the pit which\r\nhe had himself dug.\r\n\r\nMr. Kruger was fast losing his friends, and another affair which\r\noccurred about this time helped to open the eyes of those who still\r\nwished to view him in a favourable light. Mr. Chamberlain in the\r\ncourse of some remarks had stated that the President had failed to\r\nfulfil the promises which he had made at the time of the Raid. His\r\nHonour took an early opportunity to denounce Mr. Chamberlain to Mr.\r\nJ. B. Robinson and the manager of the then Government newspaper in\r\nPretoria. 'I would like Mr. Chamberlain to quote,' he said, 'any\r\ninstances of my failure to keep my promises, and I will know how to\r\nanswer him.' The challenge was published and Mr. Chamberlain\r\npromptly cabled instructions to the British Agent to ask President\r\nKruger whether he had said this and if so whether he really did\r\ndesire a statement by Mr. Chamberlain of the character indicated. Mr.\r\nKruger took his own peculiar way out of the dilemma; he repudiated\r\nthe intermediaries, denounced the statement as untrue, and said\r\nthat he was not in the habit of conveying his requests through\r\nirresponsible nobodies. The result was the immediate resignation of\r\nthe newspaper man and final rupture between the President and Mr.\r\nRobinson. Thus were two more thick-and-thin supporters cast off at\r\nconvenience and without an instant's hesitation, and thus were\r\nprovided two more witnesses to the 'something for nothing' policy.\r\nThis incident was the immediate cause of the fusion of the Chambers.\r\n\r\nIt had all along been realized that while Lord Rosmead continued to\r\nact as High Commissioner in South Africa there would be no\r\npossibility of the Uitlanders' grievances being again taken up by her\r\nMajesty's Government. The High Commissioner had committed himself to\r\nthe opinion that it would be unsuitable and indeed improper to make\r\nany representations on the subject for a considerable time. Moreover,\r\nhis age and ill-health rendered him unfit for so arduous a task. Many\r\nhard things have been said and written about the late High\r\nCommissioner, but it must be admitted that with age and infirmity\r\nweighing him down he was confronted by one of the most desperate\r\nemergencies which have ever arisen to try the nerve of a proconsul.\r\nIt is true that the responsibilities of Government are not to be met\r\nby excuses: the supports of the Empire must stand the strain or be\r\ncondemned. But it is also true that those who regard themselves as\r\nvictims may not lightly assume the functions of independent judges:\r\nand thus it was that in a mood of sympathy and regret, with perhaps\r\nsome tinge of remorse, the news of Lord Rosmead's death was accepted\r\nas evidence unanswerable of the burden which in the autumn of his\r\ndays he was called upon to bear.\r\n\r\nWhen the name of Sir Alfred Milner was mentioned as the coming High\r\nCommissioner all South Africa stood to attention. Seldom surely has a\r\nrepresentative of the Queen been put through such an ordeal of\r\nexamination and inquiry as that to which Sir Alfred Milner's record\r\nwas subjected by the people of South Africa. Not one man in a\r\nthousand had heard his name before; it was as some one coming out of\r\nthe great unknown. The first feeling was that another experiment was\r\nbeing made at the expense of South Africa; but almost before the\r\nthought had formed itself came the testimony of one and another and\r\nanother, representing all parties and all opinions in England; and\r\nthe Uitlanders in the Transvaal began to hope and finally to believe\r\nthat at last they were to have a man to deal with who would exhibit\r\nthose qualities of intelligence, fairness, and firmness, which they\r\nregarded as the essentials. Every word that was said or written about\r\nthe new High Commissioner was read and studied in South Africa. Every\r\nreference made to him by the representatives of the various political\r\nparties was weighed and scrutinized, and the verdict was that it was\r\ngood! Fair firm and able. There had not been a discordant note nor a\r\nvoice lacking in the chorus which greeted the appointment; and the\r\njudgment was, 'They have given one of England's very best.'\r\n\r\nThe impression had somehow gained ground in South Africa that the\r\nfirst act of Sir Alfred Milner would be to visit the Transvaal and\r\nendeavour to arrange matters. The hearts of the Uitlanders sank at\r\nthe thought of even the ablest and best-intentioned of men tackling\r\nso complicated a problem without any opportunity of studying the\r\nlocal conditions and the details. It was therefore with undisguised\r\nsatisfaction that they received the new High Commissioner's assurance\r\nthat as the representative of her Majesty he had plenty of work\r\nbefore him in visiting and making himself acquainted with the\r\nconditions and requirements of her Majesty's dominions in South\r\nAfrica, the people of which had the first call upon his services. The\r\nstatement cleared the political atmosphere and had a distinctly\r\ncooling effect upon the overheated brain of the Boer party, who had\r\nby this time convinced themselves that Pretoria was firmly\r\nestablished as the hub of the universe and that an expectant world\r\nwas waiting breathlessly to know what President Kruger would do next.\r\n\r\nMr. Conyngham Greene, an experienced member of the Diplomatic Corps,\r\nwho had been appointed towards the end of 1896 to succeed Sir Jacobus\r\nde Wet as British Agent in Pretoria, had by this time gained some\r\nexperience of the ways of Pretoria. Probably few servants of the\r\nCrown have been called upon to perform a service more exacting or\r\nless grateful than that which fell to the British Agent during the\r\nperiod in which Mr. Conyngham Greene has held the post. Conscious\r\nthat his Government was prevented by the acts of others from\r\nvindicating its own position, hampered by the knowledge of immense\r\nsuperiority of strength, dealing with people who advanced at every\r\nturn and under every circumstance their one grievance as a\r\njustification for all the acts of hostility which had preceded that\r\ngrievance or had been deliberately perpetrated since, he was\r\ncompelled to suffer snubs and annoyances on behalf of his Government,\r\nwith no relief but such as he could find in the office of recording\r\nthem. A good deal had been done by Mr. Conyngham Greene to establish\r\nvisible and tangible evidence of the desire of her Majesty's\r\nGovernment to interest themselves in the condition of British\r\nsubjects and--as far as the exigencies of a very peculiar case would\r\nfor the time permit--to protect them from at least the more\r\noutrageous acts of injustice; but the strength of the chain is the\r\nstrength of the weakest link, and it was always felt that until the\r\nlink in Cape Town was strengthened there was not much reliance to be\r\nplaced upon the chain.\r\n\r\nVery frequently surprise has been expressed that, after the fortunate\r\nescape from a very bad position which the Jameson Raid afforded to\r\nPresident Kruger's party, the Boers should not have learned wisdom\r\nand have voluntarily undertaken the task of putting their house in\r\norder. But having in mind the Boer character is it not more natural\r\nto suppose that, inflated and misled by a misconceived sense of\r\nsuccess and strength, they should rather persist in and exaggerate\r\nthe ways which they had formerly affected? So at least the Uitlanders\r\nthought and predicted, and their apprehensions were amply justified.\r\nIn each successive year the Raad has been relied upon to better its\r\nprevious best, to produce something more glaring and sensational in\r\nthe way of improper laws and scandalous measures or revelations\r\nthan anything which it had before done. One would imagine that it\r\nwould pass the wit of man to devise a means of exploiting the\r\nUitlanders which had not already been tried, but it would truly\r\nappear that the First Volksraad may be confidently relied upon to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1897 some things were exposed which appeared, even to the\r\nUitlanders, absolutely incredible. What is now known as the 'donkeys\r\nand mealies scandal' was one of them. For the ostensible purpose of\r\nhelping burghers who had been ruined by the rinderpest the President\r\narranged for the purchase of large numbers of donkeys to be used\r\ninstead of oxen for draught purposes, and he also arranged for the\r\nimportation of quantities of mealies to be distributed among those\r\nwho were supposed to be starving. Inquiries instituted by order of\r\nthe Volksraad revealed the fact that Volksraad members and Government\r\nofficials were interested in these contracts. The notorious Mr.\r\nBarend Vorster, who had bribed Volksraad members with gold watches,\r\nmoney, and spiders, in order to secure the Selati Railway Concession,\r\nand who although denounced as a thief in the Volksraad itself\r\ndeclined to take action to clear himself and was defended by the\r\nPresident, again played a prominent part. This gentleman and his\r\npartners contracted with the Government to supply donkeys at a\r\ncertain figure apiece, the Government taking all risk of loss from\r\nthe date of purchase. The donkeys were purchased in Ireland and in\r\nSouth America at one-sixth of the contract price. The contractors\r\nalleged that they had not sufficient means of their own and received\r\nan advance equal to three-quarters of the total amount payable to\r\nthem; that is to say for every £100 which they had to expend they\r\nreceived £450 as an unsecured advance against their profits. It is\r\nbelieved that not 10 per cent. of the animals were ever delivered to\r\nthe farmers for whom they were ostensibly bought. An attempt was made\r\nin the Volksraad to have the matter thoroughly investigated and to\r\nhave action taken against the contractors, but the affair was hushed\r\nup and, as far as it is possible to ascertain, every penny payable\r\nunder the contract has been paid and lost.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the mealies (maize, the ordinary native food),\r\nlarge quantities were bought in South America. It was alleged in\r\nthe Volksraad that the amount was far more than was necessary and\r\nthat the quality was inferior, the result being that the Government\r\nwere swindled and that the State, being obliged to sell what it\r\ndid not require, was entering unfairly into competition with the\r\nmerchants and producers in the country. But the real character of\r\nthis mealie swindle can only be appreciated when it is known how the\r\ncontract originated. The contractors having bargained to deliver\r\ndonkeys, approached the President with the explanation that donkeys\r\nbeing live-stock, would have to be accommodated upon an upper deck\r\nwhere there was ample ventilation; the result of which, they said,\r\nwould be that the ship would be top-heavy and would be obliged to\r\ntake in ballast. Surely, it was argued, it would be folly to carry\r\nworthless ballast when good mealies, which were in any case badly\r\nneeded in the country, would serve the purpose of ballasting equally\r\nwell and would, of course, show a very large profit. A contract for\r\nmealies was therefore entered into. When the inquiry was instituted\r\nin the Volksraad certain awkward facts came to light, and it devolved\r\nupon Mr. Barend Vorster to explain how it happened that the mealie\r\n'ballast' arrived and was paid for before the donkeys were shipped.\r\nThat worthy gentleman may still be thinking out the explanation, but\r\nas the money has been paid it cannot be a cause of great anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve a true perspective the reader should realize\r\nthat the President defended both these affairs and that the exposures\r\ntook place while the recommendations of the Industrial Commission\r\nwere being discussed in the Raad and fiercely combated by the\r\nPresident himself.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the Selati Railway was again brought into prominence in\r\n1897. It is quite impossible as yet to get at all the facts, but it\r\nis very generally believed that a swindle of unusual dimensions and\r\naudacity remains to be exposed, and that a real exposure would\r\nunpleasantly involve some very prominent people. At any rate the\r\nfacts which became public in 1898 would warrant that suspicion. The\r\nSelati Railway Company alleged that they had been unjustly deprived\r\nof their rights, and the Government admitting repudiation of\r\ncontract took refuge in the plea that in making the contract they\r\nhad acted _ultra vires_. It was, in fact, an exemplary case of\r\n'thieves falling out' and when the case got into the law courts a\r\npoint of real interest to the public came out; for the Company's\r\nlawyers filed their pleadings! The following account of the case is\r\ntaken from the newspapers of the time. The plea of the Selati Railway\r\nCompany states that--\r\n\r\nthe Government was very desirous that the railways should be built,\r\nand that for the purpose the business should be taken in hand by\r\ninfluential capitalists, and that, having full knowledge of the sums\r\nasked for by the original concessionaires they insisted upon the said\r\ncapitalists coming to an agreement with the concessionaires and\r\npaying them the amounts asked; that it was thus understood between\r\nthe said capitalists and the Government of the South African Republic\r\nthat the sum named in the concession as the price to be paid to the\r\nconcessionaires for the formation of the Company was wholly\r\ninsufficient under the altered conditions, and that further sums had\r\nto be expended to cover not only the increased amount demanded by the\r\noriginal concessionaires, but _also other sums of money which were\r\nasked by and paid to different members of the Executive Council and\r\nVolksraad of the South African Republic and their relatives and\r\nfriends as the price for granting the concession._\r\n\r\nThe matter came before the High Court, and several of the exceptions\r\nput forward on behalf of the Government were sustained. Regarding the\r\naccusation mentioned, Mr. Advocate Esselen, who was counsel for the\r\nState, excepted that names and particulars should be inserted, and\r\nalso that the State was not bound by the action of the Government or\r\nExecutive. He quoted the Volksraad resolution or _besluit_ upon which\r\nthe concession was granted, showing that £10,000 was mentioned as the\r\nsum to be received by the concessionaires, and then proceeded:--\r\n\r\n'Now, I say that the Government could not contract with the Company\r\nat a higher figure than is above set forth. The measure of authority\r\ngranted to the Government is set forth in the Volksraad _besluit_\r\nwhich I have read, and the Government could not exceed its authority.\r\nSecond, the defendant Company makes allegations which are tantamount\r\nto fraudulent dealing on the part of the agents of the State. But it\r\nwill be said that it is the State which sues, and that it cannot be\r\nheard to avail itself of the wrongful acts of its agents. In this\r\nmatter, however, it is the State Secretary who sues on behalf of the\r\nState. The State is not bound in any event by the acts of individual\r\nmembers of the Government. It was the Government which was entrusted\r\nwith a power of attorney on behalf of the State.'\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, so fatal to concessionaires and their methods, led to\r\nthe following interesting colloquy:--\r\n\r\nMr. Justice JORISSEN: Do you persist in this exception, Mr. Esselen?\r\n\r\nMr. ESSELEN: Certainly I do.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice JORISSEN: You have been very fortunate in succeeding\r\non two exceptions. Without pressing you in the least, I am inclined\r\nto suggest that you withdraw this exception.\r\n\r\nMr. ESSELEN: I cannot possibly withdraw it, but I am willing to allow\r\nit to stand as a special plea and to argue it at a later stage.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice JORISSEN: As I said, I don't wish to press you, but it\r\nseems to me that this is a very dangerous question.\r\n\r\nMr. ESSELEN: It is a very important question.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice JORISSEN: It is not only an important but a perilous\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn an amended plea filed by the Selati Railway Company they give the\r\nnames of persons to whom the Company had to pay certain sums of money\r\nor give presents--in other words, bribes--in order to obtain the\r\nSelati contract. The following are the names filed by Baron Eugene\r\nOppenheim:--To W.E. Bok, then member and minute keeper of the\r\nExecutive Council, on August 12, 1890, in cash £50; the late N.J.\r\nSmit, sen., then Vice-president of the South African Republic, and\r\nmember of the Executive Council, on August 12, 1890, in cash, £500;\r\nF.C.

Greyling, member of the Volksraad for\r\nHeidelberg, one cart. Total value, £1,440.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one members of the First Volksraad out of twenty-five!\r\nThe Vice-President! The son-in-law and Private Secretary of the\r\nPresident! The Secretary of the Volksraad and the Minute Keeper\r\nof the Executive!\r\n\r\nThe Volksraad, one would think, would be bound to take cognizance of\r\nsuch a statement and to cause an investigation to be held. They did\r\ntake cognizance of it after the manner peculiar to them. But the last\r\nthing in the world to be expected from them was an impartial\r\ninvestigation: nothing so foolish was ever contemplated. There were\r\ntoo many in it, and an investigation into the conduct of officials\r\nand Raad members would be establishing a most inconvenient precedent.\r\nSome members contented themselves with a simple denial, others\r\nscorned to take notice of such charges, and others tried to explain\r\nthem away. No opinion need be expressed upon the methods of the\r\nconcessionaires; nor does it matter whether the company, by its\r\nneglect or default, had justified the act of the Government. The\r\npoint which is offered for consideration is that the indisputable\r\nfact of bribes having been taken wholesale was ignored, whilst the\r\ndisputed question of liability to cancellation was arbitrarily\r\nsettled by the Government in its own favour.\r\n\r\nThe crop of scandals in 1897 was as the rolling snowball. It is\r\nunnecessary to refer to them all in detail. The Union Ground, one of\r\nthe public squares of Johannesburg, was granted to a syndicate of\r\nprivate individuals upon such terms that they were enabled to sell\r\nthe right, or portion of it, at once for £25,000 in cash. The\r\nMinister of Mines, in his official capacity, strongly recommended the\r\ntransaction, and was afterwards obliged to admit that he himself had\r\nan interest in it. The Volksraad however refused to confirm it, and\r\nthe purchaser of the concession fell back upon the President for\r\nprotection. The latter advised him to remain quiet until the\r\npresidential election, which was about to take place, should be over,\r\nand gave the assurance that then he would see that the grant was\r\nconfirmed by the Raad. In the session of 1898 his Honour strongly\r\nsupported the proposal and it was duly carried.\r\n\r\nThe Eloff location scandal was another which greatly disturbed even\r\nthe Volksraad. Mr. Frickie Eloff is President Kruger's son-in-law and\r\nenjoys the unsavoury reputation of being interested in every swindle\r\nwhich is worth being in the Transvaal. A piece of ground lying to the\r\nnorth-west of Johannesburg close up to the town had originally been\r\nproclaimed as a goldfield, but no reefs having been found there and\r\nthe ground not having been pegged, it was afterwards withdrawn from\r\nproclamation. The Mining Commissioner of Johannesburg in the course\r\nof his duties discovered some flaw in the second or withdrawing\r\nproclamation. He advised the head office in Pretoria of this\r\ndiscovery and stated that it might be contended that the\r\nde-proclamation was invalid, and that great loss and inconvenience\r\nwould follow if the ground were pegged and the title upheld. Within\r\ntwenty-four hours the ground was pegged by Mr. Eloff, but it is not\r\nknown whence he derived the inspiration. His claim was strongly\r\nopposed by the local officials. They reported that the ground was\r\nknown to be of no value, and advised that as the cost of licenses\r\nwould be very considerable the obvious policy of the Government would\r\nbe--if the title could not be upset--to wait until Mr. Eloff should\r\ntire of paying licenses on valueless ground. The Government, however,\r\ndecided otherwise: they converted Mr. Eloff's claims into residential\r\nstands; that is to say, they made him a present of an immensely\r\nvaluable piece of property and gave him title under which he could\r\ncut it up into small plots and readily sell it. This action of the\r\nGovernment, however, required confirmation by the Raad. The matter\r\ncame before the Volksraad in due course and that body deliberately\r\nrevoked the decision of the Government and refused Mr. Eloff any\r\ntitle except what he could claim according to law. But Mr. Kruger is\r\nnot so easily beaten. He soon discovered that the piece of ground\r\nacquired by Mr. Eloff was exactly the piece which it was necessary\r\nfor the Government to have for a coolie location, and without more\r\nado the Government bought it from Mr. Eloff for £25,000.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of the Boer mind in getting the last possible\r\nfraction of value out of any transaction, is well exemplified in this\r\nmatter. One would naturally conclude that a deal so profitable would\r\nsatisfy anybody. But not so! The piece of ground commands the\r\napproach to many valuable private plots and residences, and it was\r\nsoon found that apart from intrinsic worth it might have a\r\nblackmailing value; thus towards the end of 1898, after the deal had\r\nbeen completed, the owners of these residences and estates were\r\nprivately approached with the information that the coolie location,\r\nconsisting of shelters built of scraps of iron, paraffin tins, and\r\nold pieces of wood, was to be removed to this site (probably to\r\nfacilitate the transference of the present location site, which is\r\nalso very valuable, to some other favourite), but that if sufficient\r\ninducement were offered by landowners in the neighbourhood, the\r\ndecision would be reconsidered!\r\n\r\nThe grant of a Municipality to Johannesburg has often been quoted as\r\nan example of something done by Mr. Kruger in the interests of the\r\nUitlanders. The principal conditions of that grant are that all\r\nburghers of the State, whether they have property or not, shall be\r\nentitled to vote for the election of councillors; that each ward\r\nshall be represented by two councillors, one of whom must be a\r\nburgher; and that the chairman, or burgomaster, shall be appointed by\r\nGovernment and shall have the right of veto. The elections in at\r\nleast two of the wards are completely at the mercy of the police and\r\nof the poor Boers who have no interest whatever in the town. The\r\nburghers in Johannesburg--police, Boers, and officials--who may\r\nnumber a couple of thousand, including the naturalized lot, have\r\ntherefore a permanent and considerable majority over the Uitlanders,\r\nwho probably number over 40,000 adult white males.\r\n\r\nThe scope and value of this grant were made manifest when the now\r\nnotorious sewerage concession came under discussion. The Municipality\r\nhad upon several occasions endeavoured to get the right to introduce\r\na scheme for the disposal of the sewage of the town, and had applied\r\nfor authority to raise the necessary funds, but had been refused.\r\nSuddenly a concession was granted by the Government--they called it a\r\ncontract--to Mr. Emmanuel Mendelssohn, the proprietor of the\r\n_Standard and Diggers News_, the Government organ in Johannesburg.\r\nHe said that he got it for nothing--possibly a reward for loyal\r\nservices; but he also stated that he was not the sole owner. The\r\nvalue of the grant was estimated by the concessionaire himself to be\r\nabout £1,000,000 sterling, and in the lately published proposals\r\nwhich he made to one of the big firms interested in the Transvaal he\r\nindicated how a profit of £100,000 a year could be made out of it.\r\nThe Town Council unanimously and vigorously protested; but the\r\nGovernment took no notice of their protest. They then decided to\r\napply to the Court for an order restraining the Government from\r\nmaking this grant, on the ground that they had no power to alienate a\r\nright which belonged to the town itself. In order to make the\r\napplication to Court it was necessary, in terms of the constitution\r\nof the municipality, to obtain the signature of the Burgomaster. That\r\nofficial as representing the Government refused point blank to\r\nauthorize the council to dispute the Government's action in a Court\r\nof Law, and the council were obliged to apply for an Order of Court\r\ncompelling the Burgomaster to sign the documents necessary to enable\r\nthem to contest in the Courts of the country the validity of an act\r\nof the Government which was deemed to be infringement upon the rights\r\nof the town. In the face of this the President capitulated for the\r\ntime being; but neither he nor the concessionaire makes any secret of\r\nthe determination to find a _quid pro quo_.\r\n\r\nThe year 1898 brought in its turn its full share of fresh\r\nencroachments and exactions. The bare enumeration of the concessions,\r\nprivileges, and contracts, proposed or agreed to, is sufficient to\r\nindicate what must be the condition of mind of one whose interests\r\nare at stake under such a _régime_. Not all 'concessions,'\r\n'contracts,' and 'protected factories' confer exclusive rights, but\r\nmany might easily in effect do so and all are infringements upon the\r\nrights of the public. Here are some from the official list of\r\n1899;--Dynamite, Railways, Spirits, Iron, Sugar, Wool, Bricks,\r\nEarthenware, Paper, Candles, Soap, Calcium Carbide, Oil, Matches,\r\nCocoa, Bottles, Jam, &c.\r\n\r\nA large loan had been constantly talked of throughout the year, but\r\nno one knew for what purpose it could be required. The Government\r\nvouchsafed no information at all but negotiations were carried on\r\nboth in Pretoria and in Europe. Month after month went by, but the\r\nmillions were not forthcoming, and the Government believed or\r\naffected to believe that their failure was due to a conspiracy among\r\nthe capitalists, and in retaliation they directed and subsidised a\r\nfierce anti-capitalist campaign in their press. The explanation of\r\nfailure, which did not occur to them, may have been that investors\r\nbelieved that the course pursued by the Transvaal Government must\r\ninevitably lead to conflict with the paramount power, and they had no\r\nfaith and no assurance that in the event of such a conflict taking\r\nplace the British Government would take over loans which must have\r\nbeen contracted only for the purposes of war against England.\r\n\r\nThe juggling with the dynamite question continued throughout the\r\nyear. The President had successfully defeated the aim of the\r\nVolksraad, and the investigation and reports which had been ordered\r\nby that body in 1897 to be made by lawyers and auditors, although\r\nduly handed into the Government, were suppressed by the President and\r\nnot permitted to be shown to the Raad. On the contrary, the\r\nastounding proposition was made that in return for a very\r\ninconsiderable reduction in the cost of dynamite (half of which was\r\nto be made up by the Government sacrificing its share of profits) and\r\na possible further reduction of 5s. per case under certain\r\nconditions, the monopoly should be renewed for a period of fifteen\r\nyears, all breaches in the past to be condoned, and cancellation on\r\nthe ground of breach of contract in the future to be impossible. This\r\nproposal, it was publicly notified, would be laid before the Raad\r\nduring the first session of 1899. The existence of the dynamite\r\nmonopoly was at this time costing the industry £600,000 a year, and\r\non every possible occasion it was represented to the Government that,\r\nif they really did need further revenue, in no way could it be more\r\neasily or more properly raised than by exercising their undoubted\r\nright to cancel the monopoly and by imposing a duty of such amount as\r\nmight be deemed necessary upon imported dynamite. It was also pointed\r\nout that the proposed reduction in the cost of dynamite would offer\r\nno relief whatever since it was far more than counterbalanced by the\r\ntaxes upon mynpachts and profits which were then being imposed.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the Volksraad instructed the Government to\r\nenforce their right to collect 2-1/2 per cent. of the gross\r\nproduction from mynpachts (mining leases). All mynpachts titles\r\ngranted by the Government contained a clause giving the Government\r\nthis power, so that they were acting strictly within their legal\r\nrights; but the right had never before been exercised. For twelve\r\nyears investors had been allowed to frame their estimates of profit\r\nupon a certain basis, and suddenly without a day's warning this\r\ntax was sprung upon them. It was indisputably the right of the\r\nGovernment, but equally indisputably was it most unwise; both because\r\nof the manner in which it was done and because there was no necessity\r\nwhatever for the doing of it, as the revenue of the country was\r\nalready greatly in excess of the legitimate requirements. Immediately\r\nfollowing this came a resolution to impose a tax of 5 per cent. upon\r\nthe profits of all companies working mining ground other than that\r\ncovered by mynpacht. The same objections applied to this tax with the\r\nadditional one, that no clause existed in the titles indicating that\r\nit could be done and no warning had ever been given that it would be\r\ndone. The proposal was introduced one morning and adopted at once;\r\nthe first notice to investors was the accomplished fact. These\r\nmeasures were particularly keenly resented in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe grievance of hasty legislation was in these cases aggravated by\r\nthe evidence that the taxes were quite unnecessary. President Kruger\r\nstill fought against cancellation of the Dynamite Monopoly, by which\r\nthe State revenue would have benefited to the extent of £600,000 a\r\nyear, if he had accepted the proposal of the Uitlanders, to allow\r\nimportation of dynamite subject to a duty of £2 per case--a tax\r\nwhich represented the monopolists' profit, and would not therefore\r\nhave increased the cost of the article to the mines. He still\r\npersisted in squandering and misapplying the public funds. He\r\nstill openly followed the policy of satisfying his burghers at the\r\nUitlanders' expense; but the burghers have a growing appetite, and\r\nnothing shows the headlong policy of 'squaring'--nothing better\r\nillustrates the Uitlanders' grievance of reckless extravagance in\r\nadministration--than the list of fixed salaries as it has grown year\r\nby year since the goldfields became a factor.\r\n\r\n        TRANSVAAL FIXED SALARIES.\r\n\r\n                    £        s.     d.\r\n  1886             51,831     3     7\r\n  1887             99,083    12     8\r\n  1888            164,466     4    10\r\n  1889            249,641    10    10\r\n  1890            324,520     8    10\r\n  1891            332,888    13     9\r\n  1892            323,608     0     0\r\n  1893            361,275     6    11\r\n  1894            419,775    13    10\r\n  1895            570,047    12     7\r\n  1896            813,029     7     5\r\n  1897            996,959    19    11\r\n  1898          1,080,382     3     0\r\n  1899 (Budget) 1,216,394     5     0\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the Salary List is now twenty-four times as great as\r\nit was when the Uitlanders began to come in in numbers. It amounts to\r\nnearly five times as much as the total revenue amounted to then. It\r\nis now sufficient if equally distributed to pay £40 per head per\r\nannum to the total male Boer population.\r\n\r\nThe liquor curse has grown to such dimensions and the illicit liquor\r\norganization has secured such a firm hold that even the stoutest\r\nchampions of law and order doubt at times whether it will ever be\r\npossible to combat the evil. The facts of the case reflect more\r\nunfavourably upon the President than perhaps any other single thing.\r\nThese are the facts: The law prohibits the sale of liquor to natives;\r\nyet from a fifth to a third of the natives on the Rand are habitually\r\ndrunk. The fault rests with a corrupt and incompetent administration.\r\nThat administration is in the hands of the President's relations and\r\npersonal following. The remedy urged by the State Secretary, State\r\nAttorney, some members of the Executive, the general public, and the\r\nunited petition of all the ministers of religion in the country, is\r\nto entrust the administration to the State Attorney's department and\r\nto maintain the existing law. In the face of this President Kruger\r\nhas fought hard to have the total prohibition law abolished and has\r\nsuccessfully maintained his nepotism--to apply no worse construction!\r\nIn replying to a deputation of liquor dealers he denounced the\r\nexisting law as an 'immoral' one, because by restricting the\r\nsale of liquor it deprived a number of honest people of their\r\nlivelihood--and President Kruger is a total abstainer!\r\n\r\nThe effect of this liquor trade is indescribable; the loss in money\r\nalthough enormous is a minor consideration compared with the crimes\r\ncommitted and the accidents in the mines traceable to it; and the\r\neffect upon the native character is simply appalling.\r\n\r\nMuch could be said about this native question apart from the subject\r\nof drink, for it is one which is very difficult of just appreciation\r\nby any but those who have had considerable experience of and personal\r\ncontact with the natives. It is one upon which there is a great\r\ndivergence of views between the people of Europe and the people of\r\nSouth Africa. South Africans believe that they view it from the\r\nrational standpoint, they believe also that Europeans as a rule view\r\nit more from the sentimental. The people who form their opinions from\r\nthe writings and reports of missionaries only, or who have in their\r\nmind's eye the picturesque savage in his war apparel as seen at\r\nEarl's Court, or the idealized native of the novelist, cannot\r\npossibly understand the real native. The writer holds South African\r\nviews upon the native question, that is to say that the natives are\r\nto all intents and purposes a race of children, and should be treated\r\nas such, with strict justice and absolute fidelity to promise,\r\nwhether it be of punishment or reward: a simple consistent policy\r\nwhich the native mind can grasp and will consequently respect.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind it will, perhaps, be believed that the recital of\r\ncertain instances of injustice is not made with the object of\r\nappealing to sentimentalism, or of obliquely influencing opinions\r\nwhich might otherwise be unfavourable or indifferent. The cases\r\nquoted in this volume are those which have been decided by the\r\ncourts, or the evidence in support of them is given, and they are\r\npresented because they are typical cases, and not, except in the\r\nmatter of public exposure, isolated ones. The report of the case of\r\nToeremetsjani, the native chieftainess,{48} is taken verbatim from\r\none of the newspapers of the time. The woman is the head of the\r\nSecocoeni tribe, whose successful resistance to the Transvaal\r\nGovernment was one of the alleged causes of the annexation. A good\r\ndeal could be said about the ways of Native Commissioners in such\r\nmatters. Much also could be said about the case of the British\r\nIndians and the effect upon the population of India which is produced\r\nby the coming and going of thousands of these annually between India\r\nand the Transvaal, and their recital of the treatment to which\r\nthey are subjected, their tales of appeals to the great British\r\nGovernment, and their account of the latter's inability to protect\r\nthem. Much also could be said of the Cape Boy question, but\r\nsufficient prominence has been given to these matters by the\r\npublication of the official documents and the report of the inquiry\r\ninto Field-Cornet Lombaard's conduct, which was held at the instance\r\nof the British Government.\r\n\r\nIt is not suggested that if the Government in the Transvaal were\r\ninfluenced by the vote of the white British subjects, or if it were\r\nentirely dominated by such vote, any encouragement would be given to\r\nthe Indian hawkers and traders, or that there would be any\r\ndisposition whatever to give voting rights to coloured people of any\r\nkind, but it _is_ suggested that a more enlightened and a more just\r\nsystem of treatment would be adopted; and in any case it is to be\r\npresumed that there would be no appeals to the British Government,\r\ninvolving exhibitions of impotency on the part of the Empire to\r\nprotect its subjects, followed by the deliberate repetition of\r\ntreatment which might become the subject of remonstrance. The\r\nuntutored mind is not given to subtleties and sophistries; direct\r\ncause and effect are as much as it can grasp. These it does grasp and\r\nfirmly hold, and the simple inferences are not to be removed by any\r\namount of argument or explanation, however plausible. There is\r\nscarcely an Uitlander in the Transvaal who would not view with dismay\r\nthe raising of the big question upon such grounds as the treatment of\r\nthe natives, the Cape boys, or the Indians; and the fact that the\r\nTransvaal Government know this may account for much of the\r\nprovocation on these questions. It is nevertheless undeniable that\r\nwhite British subjects in the Transvaal do suffer fresh humiliation\r\nand are substantially lowered in the eyes of the coloured races,\r\nbecause appeals are made on their behalf to the British Government,\r\nand those appeals are useless. The condition of affairs should be\r\nthat such appeals would be unnecessary, and would therefore\r\nbecome--in practice--impossible. Such a condition of affairs would\r\nobtain under a friendly and more enlightened government, and the\r\nonly security for the voluntary continuance of such conditions is\r\nthe enfranchisement of the Uitlander population.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all that was gloomy unfavourable and unpromising\r\nthere came to the Uitlanders one bright ray of sunshine. Dr. Leyds\r\nwho had been re-elected State Secretary on the understanding that he\r\nwould resign immediately in order to take up the post of\r\nplenipotentiary in Europe, and whom the Boers with a growing\r\nanti-Hollander and pro-Afrikander feeling would no longer tolerate,\r\nrelinquished his office. In his stead was appointed Mr. F.W. Reitz\r\nformerly President of the Free State, a kindly, honourable, and\r\ncultured gentleman, whose individual sympathies were naturally and\r\nstrongly progressive but who, unfortunately, has not proved himself\r\nto be sufficiently strong to cope with President Kruger or to rise\r\nabove division upon race lines in critical times. Shortly afterwards\r\nMr. Christiaan Joubert, the Minister of Mines, a man totally unfit\r\nfrom any point of view to hold any office of responsibility or\r\ndignity, was compelled by resolution of the Second Volksraad to hand\r\nin his resignation. His place was filled by a Hollander official in\r\nthe Mining Department who commanded and still commands the confidence\r\nand respect of all parties. The elevation of the Acting State\r\nAttorney to the Bench left yet another highly responsible post open\r\nand the Government choice fell upon Mr. J.C. Smuts, an able and\r\nconscientious young barrister, and an earnest worker for reform. An\r\nAfrikander by birth and educated in the Cape Colony, he had taken his\r\nhigher degrees with great distinction at Cambridge and had been\r\ncalled to the English Bar.\r\n\r\nBut there came at the same time another appointment which was not so\r\nfavourably viewed. There was still another vacancy on the Bench, and\r\nit became known that, in accordance with the recommendation expressed\r\nby the Raad that all appointments should whenever possible be first\r\noffered to sons of the soil, _i.e._, born Transvaalers, it was\r\nintended to appoint to this judgeship a young man of twenty-four\r\nyears of age lately called to the bar, the son of the Executive\r\nMember Kock already referred to in this volume. The strongest\r\nobjection was made to this proposal by all parties, including the\r\nfriends of the Government; the most prominent of all objectors were\r\nsome of the leading members of the bar who, it was believed, carried\r\ninfluence and were in sympathy with the Government. A delay took\r\nplace and it was at one time believed that President Kruger had\r\nabandoned his intention, but it is understood that pressure was\r\nbrought to bear upon the President by a considerable party of his\r\nfollowers, and in the course of a few days the appointment was duly\r\ngazetted.\r\n\r\nThe selection of educated and intelligent Afrikanders, sincerely\r\ndesirous of purifying the administration, for such responsible\r\noffices as those of State Secretary and State Attorney, was\r\ngratefully welcomed by the Uitlander community, who believed that\r\nonly through the influence of such men consistently and determinedly\r\nexerted could a peaceful solution of many difficult questions be\r\nfound. It is but bare justice to these gentlemen to state that never\r\nwere they found wanting in good intention or honest endeavour, ready\r\nat all times to inquire into subjects of complaint, anxious at all\r\ntimes to redress any legitimate grievances. To them and to many other\r\nless prominent but no less worthy officials of the Transvaal Civil\r\nService, whom it is impossible to name and to whom it might prove to\r\nbe no good turn if they were named, is due an expression of regret\r\nthat they may perhaps suffer by references which are not directed\r\nagainst them but which are justified by a rotten system and are\r\ncalled for by the action of others over whom these men have no\r\ncontrol. Nobody but one intimately concerned in Transvaal affairs can\r\nappreciate the unpleasant and undeserved lot of the honest official\r\nwho necessarily, but most unjustly, suffers by association with those\r\nwho deserve all that can be said against them.\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that the gentlemen above referred to would, if\r\nit were in their power, readily accord the terms asked for in the\r\nfranchise memorandum recently submitted by the Uitlanders, but they\r\nare unfortunately entirely without influence over the President and\r\nhis party. It is true that--although British subjects by\r\nbirth--they have chosen to associate themselves with the Transvaal\r\nGovernment and are now uncompromising republicans; but there is no\r\nfault to be found with that. It may be true also that they aspire to\r\nrepublicanize the whole of South Africa, and free it of the Imperial\r\ninfluence; that would be a cause of enmity as between them and those\r\nwho desire to preserve the Imperial connection, but it is no ground\r\nfor reproach. There is one point, however, upon which they in common\r\nwith nearly all the enlightened Afrikanders throughout South Africa\r\nmay be adjudged to have fallen short in their duty; it is this, that\r\nwhilst nine times out of ten they divide upon sound principles, they\r\nwill not follow that policy to a conclusion; for upon the tenth\r\noccasion they will subordinate principle and, at the call of one who\r\nmay use it unscrupulously, will rally upon race lines alone. It is\r\nonly too true of only too many that they cannot be got to see that if\r\nthey would really divide upon principles all danger of conflict would\r\ndisappear and the solution would be both speedy and peaceful; for it\r\nis the division upon race lines that alone raises the distracting\r\nprospect of war.\r\n\r\nFor those who are in this position in the Transvaal it may be allowed\r\nthat their difficulties are great. They cannot, it is true, complain\r\nof lack of warning. They did not, it is also true, after trying their\r\ninfluence and finding it of no avail, cut adrift when they might have\r\ndone so, and by their example have so stripped the reactionaries of\r\nall support that there could now be no question of their standing\r\nout; but they may have honestly believed that they would in time\r\nsucceed, whilst the Uitlanders, judging from a long and bitter\r\nexperience, felt that they would not and could not. They may say that\r\nthis is no time to part from those with whom they associated\r\nthemselves in times of peace. Such reasoning may provide an excuse in\r\nthe Transvaal, but no such plea will avail for those without the\r\nTransvaal who have let the day of opportunity go past, and who cry\r\nout their frightened protest now that the night of disaster is upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter X\r\n\r\n{42} That President Kruger always contemplated controlling the\r\nUitlander population by arbitrary methods was proved by the choice of\r\nthe site for the Johannesburg fort. This site, on a hill commanding\r\nthe town, had been reserved by Government from the commencement, and\r\nwhen the accommodation in the old gaol proved insufficient and a new\r\ngaol was required it was located on this spot, then a favourite\r\nresidential quarter of the town. A deputation of officials waited\r\nupon the President to urge the placing of the new gaol in a more\r\nconvenient locality elsewhere. His Honour replied, 'that he did not\r\ncare about the convenience. He was going to build the gaol there,\r\nbecause some day the town would be troublesome and he would want to\r\nconvert the gaol into a fort and put guns there before that time\r\ncame.' That was at least four years before the Raid.\r\n\r\n{43} The writer has since learned from Mr.\r\nAlfred Beit that the same proposal was made to him by Mr. Graaff in\r\nJanuary, 1896, immediately after the Raid, and that it was baited\r\nwith the promise that if he and Mr. Rhodes would agree to support it\r\nthe threatened 'consequences' of their association with the Raid\r\nwould be averted. But they preferred the 'consequences.'\r\n\r\n{44} About the middle of 1895 a bad explosion of dynamite occurred\r\nin Germany under circumstances very similar to those of the\r\nJohannesburg accident. An inquiry held by the German authorities\r\nresulted in the finding that the explosion must have been due to\r\nsome fault in the dynamite, and an order was issued to destroy the\r\nremainder. The officials charged with this duty found, however, that\r\nthe owners, anticipating some such result, had removed it. It was\r\neventually traced as having been shipped from Antwerp to Port\r\nElizabeth and thence consigned to the Transvaal in November, 1895.\r\nThe Johannesburg explosion occurred in February, 1896. No competent\r\nor independent inquiry was held, although about 100 people were\r\nkilled and many more injured.\r\n\r\n{45} The gaoler--Du Plessis--in the fulfilment of his promise lost\r\nno opportunity to harass them into submission, by depriving them of\r\none thing after another, knowing that they would ask for nothing\r\nexcept as a right. As an instance, the spirit-lamp with which\r\nthey made their tea was taken from them on the pretext that no\r\ncombustibles were allowed under the prison regulations, and upon a\r\nremonstrance being made by Mr. Conyngham Greene to Dr. Leyds the\r\nlatter replied that it was necessary on account of the risk of fire.\r\nFor about eight months, therefore, water was to be--and of course\r\nwas--their only drink. Only once during the thirteen months did Du\r\nPlessis appear to 'get home.' It was when he proposed that the two\r\nshould be separated and sent to out-of-the-way gaols, widely apart\r\nand distant from all friends. Without doubt the conditions told\r\nseriously upon their health, but as both men were endowed with\r\nexceptional physique and any amount of grit they were still able to\r\ntake it smiling.\r\n\r\n{46} It is described as the Witfontein case. See page 100.\r\n\r\n{47} When the case came up again in due course a decision was given\r\nby Mr. Gregorowski, the new Chief Justice, which was regarded by the\r\nplaintiff's advisers as a reversal of the first judgment, and the\r\npractical effect of which was to bring the case under the operations\r\nof Law 1 of 1897--that is to say, to put the plaintiff 'out of court.'\r\nMr. Brown has appealed to the United States Government for redress.\r\n\r\n{48} See Appendix K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the year dragged on with its one little glimmer of light and its\r\nbig black clouds of disappointment, and it was Christmas-time when\r\nthe spark came to the waiting tinder. What a bloody bill could the\r\nholidays and holy days of the world tot up! On the Sunday night\r\nbefore Christmas a British subject named Tom Jackson Edgar was shot\r\ndead in his own house by a Boer policeman. Edgar, who was a man of\r\nsingularly fine physique and both able and accustomed to take care of\r\nhimself, was returning home at about midnight when one of three men\r\nstanding by, who as it afterwards transpired was both ill and\r\nintoxicated, made an offensive remark. Edgar resented it with a blow\r\nwhich dropped the other insensible to the ground. The man's friends\r\ncalled for the police and Edgar, meanwhile, entered his own house a\r\nfew yards off. There was no attempt at concealment or escape; Edgar\r\nwas an old resident and perfectly well known. Four policemen came,\r\nwho in any circumstances were surely sufficient to capture him.\r\nMoreover, if that had been considered difficult, other assistance\r\ncould have been obtained and the house from which there could have\r\nbeen no escape might have been watched. In any case Edgar was\r\nadmitted by the police to have sat on the bed talking to his wife,\r\nand to have been thus watched by them through the window. It is not\r\nstated that they called upon him to come out or surrender himself,\r\nbut they proceeded immediately to burst in his door. Hearing the\r\nnoise he came out into the passage. He may or may not have known that\r\nthey were police: he may or may not have believed them to be the\r\nthree men by one of whom he had been insulted. There is not a word of\r\ntruth in the statement since made that Edgar had been drinking. It\r\nwas not alleged even in defence of the police, and the post-mortem\r\nexamination showed that it was not so. A Boer policeman named\r\nJones (There are scores of Boers unable to speak a word of\r\nEnglish, who nevertheless own very characteristic English, Scotch,\r\nand Irish names--many of them being children of deserters from the\r\nBritish army!) revolver in hand burst the door open. It is alleged\r\nby the prisoner and one of the police that as the door was burst\r\nopen, Edgar from the passage struck the constable on the head\r\ntwice with an iron-shod stick which was afterwards produced\r\nin Court. On the other hand Mrs. Edgar and other independent\r\nwitnesses--spectators--testified that Edgar did not strike a blow\r\nat all and could not possibly have done so in the time. The fact,\r\nhowever, upon which all witnesses agree is that as the police\r\nburst open the door Constable Jones fired at Edgar and dropped him\r\ndead in the arms of his wife, who was standing in the passage a\r\nfoot or so behind him. On the following morning, the policeman was\r\nformally arrested on the charge of manslaughter and immediately\r\nreleased upon his comrades' sureties of £200.\r\n\r\nAs gunpowder answers to the spark so the indignation of the Uitlander\r\ncommunity broke out. The State Attorney to whom the facts were\r\nrepresented by the British Agent in Pretoria immediately ordered the\r\nre-arrest of the policeman on the charge of murder. The feeling of\r\nindignation was such among British subjects generally, but more\r\nespecially among Edgar's fellow-workmen, that it was decided to\r\npresent a petition to her Majesty praying for protection. British\r\nsubjects were invited to gather in the Market Square in order to\r\nproceed in a body to the office of the British Vice-Consul and there\r\npresent the petition, but in order to avoid any breach of the Public\r\nMeetings Act they were requested to avoid speech making and to\r\nrefrain in every way from any provocation to disorder. Some four or\r\nfive thousand persons gathered together. They listened to the reading\r\nof the petition and marched in an orderly manner to the office of\r\nthe British Vice-Consul where the petition was read and accepted.\r\n\r\nThis was the first direct appeal to her Majesty made by British\r\nsubjects since the protests against the retrocession eighteen years\r\nbefore. Not very many realized at the time the importance of the\r\nchange in procedure. There could be no \"As you were\" after the direct\r\nappeal: either it would be accepted, in which event the case of the\r\nUitlanders would be in the hands of an advocate more powerful than\r\nthey had ever proved themselves to be, or it would be declined, a\r\ncourse which would have been regarded as sounding the death-knell of\r\nthe Empire in South Africa. The time was one of the most intense\r\nanxiety; for the future of the Uitlanders hung upon the turn of the\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nIt was late one night when those who had been called to Pretoria to\r\nreceive the reply of her Majesty's Government returned to the Rand.\r\nThe real reply then was known only to three men; it was simply, point\r\nblank refusal to accept the petition. There were no reasons and no\r\nexplanations. It was done on the authority of Sir William Butler, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in South Africa and acting High Commissioner; for\r\nSir Alfred Milner was at that time in England, as also was Mr.\r\nConyngham Greene. But the faith was in these men that it could not be\r\ntrue, that it could not have happened had Sir Alfred Milner not been\r\nabsent, and thus came the suggestion to 'explain it away.' On the\r\nfollowing day British subjects on the Rand learned that a breach of\r\ndiplomatic etiquette had been committed, that the petition should\r\nnever have been published before being formally presented to her\r\nMajesty, and that thus it would be necessary to prepare and present\r\nanother in proper form. The petition was redrawn and in the course of\r\nthe following weeks upwards of 21,000 signatures were obtained by\r\nthat loyal and enthusiastic little band of British subjects who form\r\nthe Johannesburg branch of the South African League.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime other things had been happening. Messrs. Thomas R.\r\nDodd and Clement Davies Webb had been arrested under the Public\r\nMeetings Act for having organized an illegal meeting in the Market\r\nSquare, Johannesburg, for the purpose of presenting the petition to\r\nthe British Vice-Consul. They were released upon bail of £1,000\r\neach. Whether this was a fair example of the judicial perspective in\r\nthe Transvaal, or whether it was a concession to the feelings of the\r\nBoers it is impossible to say, nor does it much matter. The fact is\r\nthat for the crime of killing a British subject the bail was £200;\r\nand for the crime of objecting to it the bail was £1,000. This action\r\nonly added fuel to the fire and a public meeting was immediately\r\nconvened to be held in a circus building known as the Amphitheatre.\r\nMeetings are permitted under the Act provided they are held in an\r\nenclosed building. The object of the meeting was to record a protest\r\nagainst the arrest of Messrs. Dodd and Webb. A great many of the more\r\nardent among the British subjects were of opinion that the time for\r\nprotests and petitions was past, and they would not attend the\r\nmeeting. A great many others feeling that it was more or less a\r\nformality leading to nothing else, did not trouble to attend. Not one\r\nof those who did attend had the least suspicion of any organized\r\nopposition. The following dispatch from the High Commissioner to the\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies sufficiently describes the\r\nsequel:--\r\n\r\n  GOVERNMENT HOUSE, CAPE TOWN,\r\n                _April 5, 1899_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honour to forward herewith the certified and\r\nattested copies of affidavits which form an enclosure to Mr. Wyberg's\r\nletter, transmitted to you in my dispatch of the 28th March, but\r\nwhich did not reach me in time to catch the last mail steamer.\r\n\r\nFrom these affidavits, the number of which and the manner in which\r\nthey confirm one another seem to me to leave no doubt of their\r\ngeneral trustworthiness, it appears:\r\n\r\n1. That early on the morning of Saturday, the 14th January, the\r\nforemen in charge of the various camps along the Main Reef Road were\r\ninstructed to tell a certain number of their workmen to be at the\r\nAmphitheatre in Johannesburg at 2 p.m., where they would be addressed\r\nby an official of the Public Works Department, Mr. P.J. Malan (Hoofd\r\nvan Afdeeling Wegen).\r\n\r\n2. That the affair had been planned beforehand, and that Acting Road\r\nInspector Papenfus and others systematically visited the various\r\ncamps on that morning in order to beat up recruits, and that inquiry\r\nwas made in some cases to ensure that the persons sent should be\r\n'treu,' _i.e._, Boer or Afrikander workmen who might be expected to\r\ntake the side of the Government. The Russian workmen were not asked\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n3. That the men were paid two hours earlier than usual, and that\r\nthose men who were ordered to go were told, if they could not get\r\nGovernment carts, they should hire and recover afterwards.\r\n\r\n4. That in some cases, as that of the Boksburg section, the men were\r\nconveyed the greater part of the way by Government carts.\r\n\r\n5. That when the men arrived at the Amphitheatre, about 2 p.m., a man\r\nwho was either Mr. Bosman, Second Landdrost's Clerk, or Mr. Boshof,\r\nRegistrar of the Second Criminal Court, and perhaps both of them,\r\ntold them to go to the Police Station.\r\n\r\n6. That on arriving at the Police Station, they were addressed by Mr.\r\nBroeksma, Third Public Prosecutor, and told they were there to break\r\nup the meeting when he gave them certain signals.\r\n\r\n7. That they then went into the Amphitheatre, and that there were\r\npresent, besides Mr. Broeksma, Mr. Papenfus, Mr. Jacobs, Special Road\r\nInspector, Mr. de Villiers, Second Public Prosecutor, and Mr.\r\nBurgers, also an official, as well as several prominent members of\r\nthe Town and Special Police in plain clothes.\r\n\r\n8. That the different sections of the Road party men were placed in\r\nvarious parts of the building, under their respective foremen, and\r\nthat several Government officials assisted in locating them.\r\n\r\n9. That a number of the men did not understand what they were there\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n10. That the proceedings on the part of the promoters of the meeting,\r\nwhich, as you are aware, had been sanctioned by the Government, were\r\nperfectly regular.\r\n\r\n11. That on the first appearance of the promoters of the meeting\r\nthere was a concerted disturbance, which rendered it totally\r\nimpossible to go on with the proceedings.\r\n\r\n12. That in the riot which followed several people were seriously\r\ninjured, the sufferers in every case being _bonâ fide_ sympathizers\r\nwith the object of the meeting, and the aggressors being persons who\r\nhad come there with the object of breaking it up.\r\n\r\n13. That the Police did not make the smallest effort to check the\r\ndisturbances though it would have been easy to do so, and that, when\r\nappealed to, they maintained an attitude of indifference.\r\n\r\n14. That Broeksma, Third Public Prosecutor, and Lieutenant Murphy, of\r\nthe Morality Police, actually assisted in breaking chairs, and\r\nencouraged the rioters.\r\n\r\n    I have, &c.,\r\n         A. MILNER,\r\n  _Governor and High Commissioner._\r\n\r\nWith affairs of this kind stirring up race hatred and feeling among\r\nthe class from whom the juries have to be selected, what chance was\r\nthere of securing an impartial trial of the policeman charged with\r\nthe murder of Edgar? The Acting British Agent Mr. Edmund Fraser in\r\nhis dispatch of December 23 tells what he thought of the prospect\r\nbefore these affairs took place. 'As to the ultimate charge to be\r\nbrought against the policeman, the State Attorney was doubtful\r\nwhether the charge had not better be one of culpable homicide, for\r\nthe reason that in the presence of a Boer jury his counsel would have\r\na much easier task in getting him off under a charge of murder than\r\nfor culpable homicide. But the chances of a Boer jury convicting\r\nhim at all are so small that I said I should not assent to either\r\ncharge until I had seen what rebutting evidence the Public Prosecutor\r\nbrought.'\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Immediately after the murder of Edgar, Mr. J.S.\r\nDunn the editor of the _Critic_ newspaper, recited the facts of the\r\ncase as they were known to him and passed some severe strictures upon\r\nDr. Krause, the First Public Prosecutor, who was responsible for\r\ndetermining the charge against policeman Jones and fixing his bail in\r\nthe first instance. The steps now taken by Dr. Krause no doubt were\r\nwithin his legal rights, but they do not appear to a layman\r\ncalculated to ensure justice being done. Before proceeding with the\r\nmurder trial Dr. Krause took criminal action against Mr. Dunn for\r\nlibel, and in order to prove the libel he, whose duty it was to\r\nprosecute Jones for murder, entered the witness-box and swore that\r\nunder the circumstances as known to him he did not consider that\r\nJones had been guilty of murder, and had therefore faithfully\r\nperformed his duty in charging him with the minor offence and\r\nreleasing him on bail. Further, he called upon the Second Public\r\nProsecutor to testify in a similar strain; and finally he directly\r\nand deliberately associated with himself as witness on his side the\r\nman Jones himself who was charged with the murder. All this\r\nostensibly to prove a paltry libel which could have been dealt with\r\nquite as effectively and infinitely more properly after the trial for\r\nmurder had taken place; indeed it is incontestable that the verdict\r\nin the murder trial should properly have been relied upon to a large\r\nextent to determine the gravity of Mr. Dunn's offence. It had\r\nappeared to the British population that the chance of an impartial\r\ntrial, with the jury drawn exclusively from the burgher class, was\r\nsufficiently remote without any proceedings so ill considered as\r\nthese. The result fulfilled anticipations. In due course the\r\nconstable Jones was indicted for culpable homicide and acquitted; and\r\nthe presiding judge (Mr. Kock, who as already described had claimed a\r\njudgeship as a 'son of the soil') when discharging the prisoner said,\r\n'With that verdict I concur and I hope that the police under\r\ndifficult circumstances will always know how to do their duty.'\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary examination of Jones the Acting British Agent\r\nhad written to the Acting High Commissioner (December 30, 1898): 'I\r\nwill only remark that the enclosed report ... seems to show that the\r\nPublic Prosecutor (Krause), who has been deeply offended by the slur\r\ncast upon his judgment through the orders from Pretoria to keep the\r\naccused in prison instead of out on bail, was more inclined to defend\r\nthan to prosecute and showed an extraordinary desire to incriminate\r\neither the British Vice-Consul or the South African League for what\r\nhe termed contempt of court in connection with the publication of\r\ncertain affidavits in the _Star_.'\r\n\r\nThat was indeed the position. In this as in the Cape Boys case (the\r\nLombaard inquiry) the aim of the prosecution appeared to be to prove\r\nthat the British Vice-Consul had investigated and reported cases of\r\ninjustice suffered by British subjects; and the establishment of such\r\nproof seemed to be considered a sufficient and triumphant answer to\r\nthe original complaint. Such action drew the following spirited\r\nprotest from Mr. Emrys Evans to the British Agent: 'He (Krause) seems\r\ngenerally to suppose that I have no right to do anything in the way\r\nof assisting British subjects, and that my action as Vice-Consul is\r\nnothing more nor less than officious meddling.' That well describes\r\nthe position of Great Britain's representative in the Transvaal, and\r\nit has been the same for so many years that among the Uitlanders it\r\ncreates no feeling of surprise; but imagine the representative\r\nof--let us say--the United States being so treated!\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were proceeding an opportunity occurred to raise\r\nfresh funds for the Uitlander Education Council. The scheme had been\r\nperilously near collapse on several occasions, but by a little\r\ngenerous and timely help actual abandonment had been averted. The\r\npossibility of a return of better times had been foreseen by some of\r\nthose interested in education, and the appeals which were made in the\r\nmonths of February and March resulted in raising a fund of over\r\n£100,000. The companies were also applied to for assistance in the\r\nform of annual grants for maintenance; and guarantees were given\r\namounting in all to about £16,000 a year. A final effort was made by\r\nthe Government party and the allies of Dr. Mansvelt, the\r\nSuperintendent of Education, to show that the Government had made\r\nample provision for the education of English-speaking children, and\r\nthat the Uitlanders' scheme was unnecessary. Even Mr. Reitz, the\r\nState Secretary, it is to be regretted, undertook a public defence of\r\nthe system which he has frequently expressed his disapproval of; but\r\nthe more favourable construction which he endeavoured to place upon\r\nthe law was immediately removed by a plain statement from the\r\nPresident to the exact contrary effect.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlanders consider that, if the intentions of the Government\r\nwere as good as they desire them to be thought, firstly, they should\r\nnot object to have the conditions permanently established and not\r\nleave them liable to alteration at the sweet will of the\r\nSuperintendent, as they are to-day; and secondly, as there has been\r\nnothing to hinder the carrying out of benevolent intentions--had they\r\nexisted--there is no reason why there should be five or six thousand\r\nUitlander children without any facilities for education in their own\r\nlanguage except such as are provided by private enterprise or\r\ncharity. And this is so; notwithstanding the expenditure by the State\r\nof nearly a quarter of a million per annum, ostensibly upon\r\neducation, nine-tenths of which sum is contributed by the Uitlander\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which the State aid is given and the aim which the\r\nGovernment have in view are entirely revealed in the conditions, a\r\nbrief reference to which will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe Government capitation grant of £4 per annum may be earned on the\r\nconditions:--\r\n\r\n(a) That the child be over six years of age.\r\n\r\n(b) That it shall have a sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language\r\nand South African history.\r\n\r\n(c) That it be not the child of Dutch or Hollander parents.\r\n\r\n(d) That a qualified Dutch teacher must be retained by the school.\r\n\r\nThe first condition excludes all the children of the kindergarten\r\nschools, and also a class who form a considerable percentage in the\r\nelementary schools. The third condition excludes all those who have\r\nin early years any chance of satisfying the inspectors under the\r\nsecond condition. Obviously the amount earned by the few who would\r\nsatisfy all the conditions could not possibly pay for the salary of\r\na Dutch teacher. It was an actual experience in several schools that\r\nthe acceptance of State aid involved a direct loss; a good example of\r\nthe 'something for nothing' policy.\r\n\r\nEnglish is permitted to be the medium of instruction in Government\r\nschools on the conditions, among others--\r\n\r\nThat Dutch be taught for one hour a day during the first year, two\r\nhours a day during the second year, three hours a day during the\r\nthird year; and that in the fourth year Dutch shall become the sole\r\nmedium of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic trickery and cunning which mark so many of the\r\nBoer-Hollander enactments are again apparent here. The proposal is\r\nmade to appear reasonable, but it is clearly impossible for a child\r\nto attain within the time named such proficiency in a foreign\r\nlanguage as to be able to receive all instruction in it. The effect\r\nand the design are to place English-speaking children at a grave\r\ndisadvantage compared with Dutch-speaking children; either they would\r\nhave to devote a great deal more time to the study of Dutch in the\r\nfirst three years so as to be able to receive all instruction in that\r\ntongue, or they would suffer in the higher standards through their\r\nimperfect knowledge of the medium of instruction. It was not to be\r\nsupposed that the Uitlanders, after an experience extending over a\r\ndecade and a half of all sorts of promises, not one of which had been\r\nkept in the spirit in which it was intended to be construed, would\r\nconsent to abandon their scheme at the behest of Dr. Mansvelt and the\r\nmisguided few who judged his proposals by appearances. President\r\nKruger speaking at Rustenburg as lately as March last laid particular\r\nemphasis upon the stipulation in the Law that in the fourth year\r\nDutch should be the sole medium of instruction, and explained that\r\nhis determination was to make Dutch the dominant language.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February the Transvaal Government received a dispatch\r\nfrom her Majesty's Government with reference to the dynamite\r\nconcession. It referred to the announcement already recorded, that in\r\nthe course of the coming session of the Raad a proposal would be\r\nsubmitted for the extension of the monopoly for fifteen years.\r\nMr. Chamberlain pointed out that her Majesty's Government were\r\nadvised that the dynamite monopoly in its present form constitutes a\r\nbreach of the Convention; he expressed the hope that the Transvaal\r\nGovernment might see its way voluntarily either to cancel the\r\nmonopoly or to so amend it as to make it in the true sense a State\r\nmonopoly operating for the benefit of the State; and he suggested\r\nthat in any case no attempt should be made to extend the present\r\nconcession, as such a proposal would compel her Majesty's Government\r\nto take steps which they had hitherto abstained from taking in the\r\nhope and belief that the Transvaal Government would itself deal\r\nsatisfactorily with the matter. It was with this despatch, so to say\r\nin his pocket, that the President introduced and endeavoured to force\r\nthrough the Raad the proposal to grant a fifteen years' extension of\r\nthe monopoly.\r\n\r\nThat representations had been made by the British Government on the\r\nsubject of the dynamite monopoly, had been known for some time before\r\nthe Peace Negotiations (as they have been called) between the\r\nGovernment and the Capitalists were proposed. On February 27{49} Mr.\r\nEdouard Lippert, the original dynamite concessionaire, who it was\r\nknown would receive the further sum of £150,000 if the monopoly\r\nremained uncancelled for five years, opened negotiations on behalf of\r\nthe Government with certain representatives of the capitalist groups\r\non the Rand; and it was immediately seen that the main--one might\r\nalmost say sole--object of the negotiations was to safeguard the\r\ndynamite monopoly. The Government had, in fact, been placed in a very\r\nawkward position. One of the excuses for not expropriating the\r\nmonopoly had been that the State had not been successful in raising a\r\nloan. In order to deal with this objection the Chamber of Mines had,\r\nin the month of February, 1899, made an offer, guaranteed by all the\r\nprincipal firms on the Rand, to provide the sum of £600,000 to\r\ncompensate the monopolists for their actual expenditure up to date\r\nupon buildings, plant, machinery, &c., so that there should be no\r\nsemblance of injustice in the treatment meted out to them. The\r\nconditions of the offer were that the dynamite monopoly should be\r\ncancelled and importation of explosives permitted under an import\r\nduty which would give the State a very large revenue at once and\r\nwhich in the course of a few years would provide a sinking fund\r\nsufficient to extinguish the loan of £600,000. The offer was so\r\nfavourable to the State that it placed the Government in a\r\nquandary.{50} The attitude of the Volksraad, too, was distinctly\r\nhostile to the dynamite monopoly; and on top of all came the\r\nrepresentations of the Imperial Government upon the subject. It\r\nbecame necessary to do something to save the threatened\r\n'cornerstone'; hence the Peace negotiations between the Government\r\nand the capitalists.\r\n\r\nThis was another and one of the clearest examples of the 'something\r\nfor nothing' policy, for it will be observed that of all the things\r\nmentioned dynamite alone was the matter to be definitely settled--and\r\nthat to the satisfaction of Mr. Kruger. Long years of experience\r\nhad taught the Uitlanders to examine any proposals coming from the\r\nGovernment with the utmost care; and the representatives of the\r\nmining industry were soon of one mind in regarding these negotiations\r\nas nothing but a trap.\r\n\r\nOf the five men who represented the Government, viz., the President,\r\nthe State Secretary (Mr. Reitz), the State Attorney (Mr. Smuts), the\r\nForeign Plenipotentiary (Dr. Leyds), and the 'disinterested\r\nintermediary,' Mr. Lippert, it was easy enough to account for three.\r\nThe President had frequently pledged himself to maintain the\r\nmonopoly, and always referred to it as the corner-stone of the\r\nindependence. Dr. Leyds had chosen to associate himself with the\r\ndefence of the concessionaires upon all occasions, and had even gone\r\nso far, as evidence given at the Industrial Commission showed, as to\r\nmisrepresent the facts in their defence. The difficulty was how to\r\nexplain the association of the State Attorney and State Secretary, in\r\nwhose good intentions and integrity there was a general belief. The\r\nsolution was to be found in the illusory promises of reform under the\r\nheading of franchise and reorganization of the finances and other\r\nmatters. These proposals, it was believed by Mr. Kruger and his\r\nparty, would secure the support of the two above-named officials, as\r\nwell as entice the capitalists into the trap set for them. But there\r\nwere other points of advantage for Mr. Kruger. The whole scheme was\r\nin accordance with the _divide et impera_ policy. The first\r\nimpression, if the scheme were accepted, would be that the\r\ncapitalists had secured something for themselves by bartering away\r\nthe rights of the public; so there would have been a division in\r\nJohannesburg. Another effect to be brought about by the proposed\r\naction regarding the Indians would have been to divide the Uitlanders\r\nfrom the Imperial Government, and the net result of it all would have\r\nbeen that neither the public nor the capitalists would have got\r\nanything but illusory promises and Mr. Kruger would have secured his\r\ndynamite; for had he been able to extract from the Industry an\r\nexpression of approval or acquiescence, it would have given him his\r\nmajority in the Volksraad in favour of the monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe following is the correspondence which passed:--\r\n\r\n  JOHANNESBURG, S.A.R.,\r\n      _27th March, 1899._\r\n\r\n_To the Honourable the State Secretary, Pretoria._\r\n\r\nHONOURABLE SIR,\r\n\r\nBefore communicating to you and the representatives of the Government\r\nwhom we met the expression of our opinion and that of our London\r\nfriends on the proposals submitted to us by Mr. Lippert on behalf of\r\nthe Government of the S.A.R., we deem it advisable to recite shortly\r\nhow we have arrived at the present position.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February Mr. E. Lippert called together Messrs. A.\r\nBrakhan, E. Birkenruth, and G. Rouliot, to whom he submitted a\r\ncertain programme concerning the settlement of some pending questions\r\nforming the subject of grave differences between the Government of\r\nthe S.A.R., on the one part, and the whole Uitlander population and\r\nthe mining industry on the other part, with a view to ascertain\r\nwhether these gentlemen were willing to open negotiations on the\r\nbasis suggested, in order to try to come to a settlement. Upon the\r\naffirmative answer of these gentlemen, Mr. Lippert obtained an equal\r\nexpression of approval from Dr. Leyds, the State Secretary, the State\r\nAttorney, and also of President Kruger. The preliminary programme at\r\nMr. Lippert's request was then communicated by cable to our London\r\nfriends. Upon receipt of a reply to the effect that our London\r\nfriends were in favour of any arrangement which would produce harmony\r\nand secure administrative and financial reform, which was\r\ncommunicated to Mr. E. Lippert, a meeting was arranged with Dr.\r\nLeyds, Messrs. Reitz, Smuts, and Lippert, as representing the\r\nGovernment, on the 9th of March; but as Messrs. Brakhan, Birkenruth,\r\nand Rouliot had repeatedly mentioned that they did not consider\r\nthemselves qualified to discuss matters on behalf of the general body\r\nof Uitlanders, and seeing that the programme submitted was to be\r\nconsidered as a whole, and either adopted or rejected as such,\r\ntherefore it would be necessary to obtain the views, on the franchise\r\nquestion, of prominent citizens more able to express the wishes of\r\nUitlanders on this subject; Mr. Lippert, on behalf of the Government,\r\ninvited in addition Messrs. Pierce and Pistorious to be present at\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting several points were discussed, but as no definite\r\nproposal regarding franchise could be submitted, no decision was\r\narrived at, it being made clear, however, that this was only a\r\npreliminary conversation with the object of exchanging views, and\r\nthat in any case the opinion of the Uitlander population, and also\r\nthat of our friends in Europe, would have to be fully ascertained.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th instant, at the request of Mr. Lippert, Messrs. Brakhan,\r\nBirkenruth, Rouliot, Pierce, Pistorious and Fitzpatrick met, and Mr.\r\nLippert communicated to us the definite proposals of the S.A.R.\r\nGovernment, which were duly cabled the same day to our friends,\r\nrequesting a reply before the end of the week, as the Government\r\nwould have to submit the whole matter to the Raad, and we were\r\nrequested to sign an agreement with the Government, and a declaration\r\nbinding on ourselves and our London friends.\r\n\r\nTheir answer, suggesting a further conference with Dr. Leyds in\r\nLondon, was duly communicated to his Honour the State President. His\r\nHonour's reply, stating that the exchange of views had better take\r\nplace here, was communicated to our European friends.\r\n\r\nNow they have cabled us a full _précis_ of the proceedings and\r\nresolutions passed at the meeting held in London on the 16th\r\ninstant, and the following is therefore the expression of our opinion\r\nas well as that of our European friends, upon the subjects which have\r\nalready been discussed between the representatives of the S.A.R.\r\nGovernment, and ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt having been stipulated by the Government that the various matters\r\nherein dealt with shall be taken as parts of one whole plan, we have\r\nbowed to that decision, and we beg now to reply under the various\r\nheads on the understanding that no one portion may be judged as apart\r\nfrom the whole.\r\n\r\nBEWAARPLAATSEN.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the general settlement, those of us directly\r\nconcerned in the mining industry would be prepared to recommend a\r\nmodification of the claims of the surface holder and a final\r\nsettlement of the question on the lines suggested as preferable to\r\nthe continued uncertainty, on the understanding that the basis for\r\nvaluation should be arrived at by fixing, after consultation, a\r\nmaximum price upon the best situated bewaarplaatsen or water-right,\r\nand that the price of all other mining rights under bewaarplaatsen,\r\nmachine stands or water-rights be valued by competent engineers on\r\nthe basis and in relation to the above maximum value, taking into\r\nconsideration the comparative value of the outcrop claims and the\r\ndiminishing value in depth; the surface holder having the preferent\r\nright to acquire the undermining rights at the price thus arrived at.\r\n\r\nFINANCIER AND AUDITOR.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a suitable man with efficient control and assured\r\nstatus would undoubtedly meet one of the most serious of the\r\ngrievances, and would be universally accepted as satisfactory. The\r\nfinancier, in order to enjoy the confidence of all concerned, and\r\nwith a view to avoid as far as possible ulterior discussion of his\r\nrecommendations, should be approved of by some person belonging to a\r\nfirm of well-known independent standing, such as Lord Rothschild, for\r\ninstance. The financier to be a member of the Executive Council, and\r\nto formulate and approve every scheme of taxation should further or\r\nother taxation become necessary.\r\n\r\nLOAN.\r\n\r\nAny loan offered at reasonable rates and approved by the Finance\r\nMinister for the common good would undoubtedly receive our support;\r\nwe understanding, on the other hand, that no new taxation will be\r\nimposed on the general population or the mining industry pending the\r\nappointment of the financier.\r\n\r\nPRESS AGITATION.\r\n\r\nThere having been, as far as we know, no organized press agitation,\r\nit is impossible for us to deal with this matter, but it is clear\r\nthat the criticism which has been provoked by a certain condition of\r\naffairs here would necessarily cease upon the causes of complaint\r\nbeing removed, and we would be prepared, in case of our coming to a\r\nsettlement with the Government, to declare that the solution of the\r\nquestions arrived at meets with our approval as a whole, so as to\r\ndiscourage further agitation in newspapers on these subjects.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nWe shall at all times be willing to publicly discourage and repudiate\r\nany political organization having for its object the stirring up of\r\nstrife or promoting dissension between the different nationalities\r\ninhabiting this State, and we would and will in any case do this\r\nfreely and upon principle, and entirely apart from other\r\nconsiderations connected with this Conference, but it should be\r\nclearly understood that this declaration must not be construed as\r\nrepudiating or deprecating any legitimate representations which the\r\ncommunity or any section of them may see fit to make in matters which\r\nconcern them as inhabitants of this State.\r\n\r\nCOOLIE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nWe well appreciate the dangers of uncontrolled, indiscriminate\r\nimmigration of the lower class Indians, Chinese, and other coloured\r\nraces, and the necessity for provision for sanitary control, and\r\nshall be most willing to aid the Government in the above objects; but\r\nwe consider it impossible for us to intervene in this matter, which\r\nis governed by the London Convention with the British Government. We\r\nsuggest that for the purpose of guarding against the dangers above\r\nreferred to, this matter be explained to the Imperial Government as\r\npart of the whole scheme for the settlement of differences, and claim\r\ntherefore an especially favourable consideration, for, in the success\r\nof this scheme, all who desire peace and prosperity in this country\r\nmust be deeply concerned and willing to co-operate on generous lines.\r\nWe suggest that this representation be made in such manner as may be\r\ndeemed less calculated to provoke unfavourable comment, or offend\r\nsusceptibilities in any quarter, and that the suggestion be viewed by\r\nall parties in its true proportions as one part of the whole scheme\r\nof settlement. Unless so viewed we should be unable to put ourselves\r\nforward in a matter at issue between the two Governments, nor of\r\ncourse could the proposals of the Government be taken to suggest\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nDYNAMITE.\r\n\r\nWith the principle of granting a monopoly to individuals, agencies,\r\nor corporations it is impossible for us to agree, and whatever\r\narrangement be effected, we should have to make it clear that in this\r\ninstance we are viewing the question solely as a burden--a tax which\r\nthe mines are asked to definitely accept in order that an\r\namelioration of the general conditions affecting the whole Uitlander\r\npopulation may be secured.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the cost at which dynamite could be imported\r\n(exclusive of Transvaal duty) and the price we are now compelled to\r\npay amounts to over £600,000 per annum on the present rate of\r\nconsumption, a sum which will increase steadily and largely in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\nWhether the mining industry should voluntarily accept such an immense\r\nburden as a set-off against terms which, whilst they would doubtless\r\neventually favourably affect the industry, are in their immediate\r\neffects designed to satisfy the Uitlander population in their\r\npersonal rights as distinct from the mining industry as a business,\r\nis a matter which would in the first place have to be submitted to\r\nthe recognized elected representatives of the mining industry, and\r\nwould in the second place depend upon whether the people in whose\r\ninterest such sacrifice is required would accept the terms which the\r\nGovernment would be willing to concede as satisfying their reasonable\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\nIt is also a matter of grave and general concern that a sum so\r\nenormous, when compared with the revenue requirements of the State,\r\nshould be taken annually from the mines with little, if any, benefit\r\nto the country, when it might be utilized in part or entirely in\r\nsupplementing the State revenue, and thus afford relief in other\r\ndirections to every taxpayer in the country.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above considerations, however, we feel that a\r\ngreat monetary sacrifice might be made to secure a peaceful and\r\npermanent solution of vexed questions, and that the subject of\r\ndynamite should be submitted to the Chamber of Mines and discussed in\r\nthat spirit.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are willing, in order to bring about a general settlement\r\nof all pending questions, to recommend such a heavy sacrifice to be\r\nmade, and adopt the proposal made by the Government, it would be a\r\ncondition that there shall not be any extension of the concession,\r\nand that the terms of the contract shall be rigidly enforced; that\r\nthe Dynamite Company shall reduce the price of dynamite to 70s. per\r\ncase, giving to the Government the 5s. per case and the share of the\r\nprofits to which it is entitled; and that at the end of the present\r\nagency the factory shall be taken over at a valuation which shall not\r\ninclude compensation for goodwill or for loss of future business.\r\n\r\nFRANCHISE.\r\n\r\nThis is the vital point upon which a permanent and peaceful\r\nsettlement must hinge, and if a satisfactory solution can be arrived\r\nat on this point, as well as on the others raised, we shall be\r\nprepared to recommend to the Industry to make the sacrifices involved\r\nin accepting the Government proposals.\r\n\r\nWe note that--\r\n\r\n_(a)_ the proposals do not include a substantial recognition of past\r\nresidence;\r\n\r\n_(b)_ that the period is seven years;\r\n\r\n_(c)_ that it is proposed that those who acquire citizenship under\r\nthe law, if changed as proposed, shall not have the vote for the\r\noffice of President, and that the oath of allegiance would be\r\nrequired seven years before the acquisition of limited burgher\r\nrights;\r\n\r\n_(d)_ that the proposed new law would have to be published for a year\r\nand receive the assent of two-thirds of the enfranchised burghers of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nWhilst declaring ourselves willing to accept and recommend the\r\nacceptance of any fair scheme on constitutional reforms, we consider\r\nthat such a scheme must first be laid before, and approved by, the\r\nunenfranchised community, as the rights, liberties, and privileges of\r\nthe community would depend absolutely on the nature of the reform.\r\n\r\nWe have repeated on many occasions that business houses are not\r\nqualified to discuss this question on behalf of the general body of\r\nUitlanders, and that we would not presume that we were appointed by\r\nthe whole community to discuss it on their behalf. It will therefore\r\nbe necessary to find means to bring the whole question before those\r\ndirectly affected, who are the only ones entitled to finally dispose\r\nof the matter, their acquiescence to the scheme having to be first\r\nobtained before we recommend the sacrifices which we contemplate in\r\norder to ensure a general permanent and peaceful settlement.\r\n\r\nFor your guidance we enclose an expression of opinion which has been\r\nfurnished to us by some of the most prominent Uitlanders, and\r\nplaces before you the views of a very large and influential section\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\nThe above subjects are only those which have been discussed between\r\nthe Government representatives and ourselves, but, in order to arrive\r\nat a final permanent settlement, we think that we ought to endeavour\r\nto remove all other causes of disagreement, and treat as well several\r\nother important questions left untouched; and we would beg that the\r\nGovernment will take the necessary steps, as far as lies in their\r\npower, to assist the industry by bringing native labourers to the\r\ngoldfields, and to this end will be willing to confer with the\r\nChamber of Mines as to the best means to be adopted; that the law\r\nrelating to the sale of intoxicating liquor at present in force shall\r\nbe maintained and strictly enforced. We may further state that we\r\nhave every confidence in the probity and honour of the Judges of the\r\nS.A.R., and wish to place on record our desire that the independence\r\nof the Bench should be assured and maintained inviolate in the\r\nhighest interests of all the inhabitants of the Republic.\r\n\r\nWe enclose copy of the cable which we sent, embodying the proposals\r\nof the Government of the S.A.R. as communicated to us by Mr. Lippert,\r\nand copy of the _précis_ and resolution passed at the meeting held in\r\nLondon, when the above cable was considered.\r\n\r\nThis letter conveys to you our opinion as well as that of our friends\r\nin Europe, and we should be most happy to arrange a meeting with you\r\nand any other representatives of the Government to consider and\r\ndiscuss the points contained therein.\r\n\r\nWe beg to assure you once more that we, as well as our European\r\nfriends, are most sincerely desirous to arrive at a satisfactory\r\nsettlement, securing a peaceful future and promoting the welfare of\r\nthe country and the people, and trust that you will regard the\r\nexpression of our opinion in that light.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We remain, honourable Sir,\r\n         Yours obediently,\r\n              G. ROULIOT.\r\n              H.F.E. PISTORIUS.\r\n              E. BIRKENRUTH.\r\n              JOHN M. PIERCE.\r\n              A.

DALRYMPLE.\r\n\r\nThe following memorandum--the one referred to in the above\r\nletter--was prepared by well-known Uitlanders whom the Government,\r\nowing to the refusal of the capitalists to deal with the franchise,\r\nhad been obliged to select in order to get some pronouncement upon\r\nthat question. The little ironies of life have two properties: the\r\nhumour for the winner, and the hurt for the worsted. The Uitlanders\r\nhad for three years enjoyed a singularly monotonous experience in\r\nironies, but a turning came in the long lane when it became necessary\r\nfor the President to suspend the operation of his three years' ban\r\non two of the Reformers in order to get their advice upon the\r\nfranchise question.\r\n\r\n  JOHANNESBURG, S.A.R.,\r\n         _24th March, 1899._\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nIn response to the invitation from the Government of the South\r\nAfrican Republic conveyed to us by Mr. E. Lippert, we beg to submit\r\nthe enclosed memorandum upon the franchise question.\r\n\r\n  Yours faithfully,\r\n    J. PERCY FITZPATRICK.\r\n    H.C. HULL.\r\n    W. DALRYMPLE.\r\n    W.A.

Brakhan,\r\n             J.M. Pierce,\r\n             H.F.E. Pistorius\r\n                       Johannesburg_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM _RE_ FRANCHISE.\r\n\r\nAfter such investigation as the restrictions imposed have permitted,\r\nwe are of opinion that it would be quite useless to approach the\r\nUitlander population with the Government proposal in its present\r\nform, chiefly for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n1. No consideration is given to the term of residence already\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n2. The alteration of the franchise law according to lately prescribed\r\nprocedure, whereby two-thirds of the burghers must signify approval,\r\nis a practical impossibility,--witness the fact that at the last\r\nPresidential election, surpassing in excitement and interest all\r\nother occasions of general voting, with the three recognized leaders\r\nin the field, and every agency at work to stimulate activity, less\r\nthan two-thirds of the burghers on the register recorded their votes.\r\n\r\n3. The present form of oath would be regarded as humiliating and\r\nunnecessary, in support of which view we instance that quite recently\r\nthe Volksraad of the Orange Free State rejected upon the same grounds\r\nthe proposed introduction of the same oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\n4. The period of disqualification, during which the Uitlander would\r\nhave given up his own citizenship by naturalizing and have acquired\r\nnothing in return, would be found most objectionable--especially\r\nwith the experience that rights have in the past been legislated away\r\nas they were on the point of maturing.\r\n\r\n5. In view of the unique conditions of this country, extension of the\r\nfranchise without some approach to equitable redistribution of\r\nrepresentatives would be regarded as no solution of the question and\r\nmight even provoke doubts as to the _bonâ fides_ of the proposal,\r\nwhich would be a deplorable beginning, yet one easily to be avoided.\r\n\r\nRegard being had to the points raised in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4,\r\nwe consider that as restrictive franchise legislation, apparently\r\ndesigned to exclude for ever the great bulk of the Uitlander\r\npopulation, dates its beginning from the Session of 1890, and as the\r\nvarious enactments bearing upon this question have been passed by\r\nsuccessive Volksraads exercising their power to alter, add to, or\r\nrevoke, previous enactments, and as the same powers are to the full\r\nenjoyed by the present Volksraad, it would be both possible and\r\nproper for the present Volksraad to annul all the legislation upon\r\nthis subject from that date, and to restore and confirm the status\r\nprior to 1890, and thus satisfy the indisputable claims of those who\r\nsettled in this country under certain conditions from the benefits of\r\nwhich they could not properly be excluded.\r\n\r\nWith regard to paragraph 5, a moderate proposal designed to give a\r\nmore equitable distribution of representatives in the Volksraad would\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nThe above suggestions are not put forward as the irreducible minimum,\r\nnor are they designed for public use, nor intended as a proposal\r\nacceptable to the eye but impossible in fact, and thus sure of\r\nrejection. They are put forward in good faith as indicating in our\r\nopinion the lines upon which it would be possible to work towards a\r\nsettlement with a reasonable prospect of success.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulties appear great the more reason there is not to put\r\nforward an unalterable proposal foredoomed to failure, but rather to\r\ntry and find points of agreement which, however few and small to\r\nbegin with, would surely make for eventual and complete settlement.\r\nIn any case it is clear that the mere fact of a proposal to extend\r\nthe franchise having been made by the Government, thus frankly\r\nrecognizing the need to deal with the subject, will be hailed as a\r\ngood omen and a good beginning by all fair-minded men.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the negotiators to have the position clearly\r\nstated in writing, and their fear that the use of intermediaries\r\nwould end in the usual unhappy and unpleasant result--namely,\r\nrepudiation of the intermediary in part or entirely--were not long\r\nwanting justification. The following is a translation of Mr. F.W.\r\nReitz's reply:--\r\n\r\n  PRETORIA, _8th April, 1899._\r\n\r\n_Messrs. G. Rouliot, H.F.E. Pistorius, A. Brakhan, E. Birkenruth,\r\nand John M. Pierce, Johannesburg_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIRS,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th\r\nMarch last, referring to certain proposals to the Government from\r\nrepresentatives of the mining industry.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the natural position it is necessary to state\r\nthe facts more extensively than given in your letter.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to say, as you do in the first paragraph of your\r\ncommunication, that Mr. Lippert came to you with certain proposals\r\nfrom the Government.\r\n\r\nIt appears also from the second paragraph of the same that Mr.\r\nLippert came to you _suo motu_ with the object, as he informed me\r\nafterwards, to see 'if it was not possible to obtain a better\r\nunderstanding between the Government on the one side and the mining\r\nindustry on the other.' He acted in no wise as the agent of the\r\nGovernment, or in the name of the Government, to make any proposals\r\nto you, but only as a friendly mediator to see how far unnecessary\r\ndifferences and misunderstandings could be removed.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lippert came to Dr. Leyds and myself, and informed us that\r\nyou and other gentlemen were agreeable to his mediation, we at once\r\nagreed with his plan, being aware that there was a warm desire and\r\ncontinued struggle on the part of this Government to remove out of\r\nthe way all friction and trouble, and that in this case especially it\r\nwas our object to leave no stone unturned to get all differences\r\nsettled. We were the more anxious to meet you, because his Honour the\r\nState President had decided to lay before the Volksraad certain\r\nproposals of law, which are of great importance not only for the\r\npeople of the Republic, but especially for the mining population and\r\nindustry. We gave Mr. Lippert to understand that should the leaders\r\nof the mining industry have no objection to his mediation, we would\r\nnot be unwilling to make use of his good services in this matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippert then went to Johannesburg, and returned to us with the\r\nassurance that there was no objection to his acting as mediator, and\r\ngave us some of the subjects on which it appeared to him that it was\r\npossible to arrive at a friendly understanding.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, and acting on our own initiative, and not as\r\nrepresentatives of the Government, Dr. Leyds, Mr. Smuts, and myself,\r\nmet some of your leading men, as set forth in your letter.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting we informed you of the intention of the President to\r\nalter certain laws for the general good. Only with reference to the\r\nfranchise we gave you no definite proposal, the matter being then\r\nstill under consideration. From your side we requested only a more\r\nfriendly attitude from the Press, as we were convinced that the\r\nexcessive Press campaign carried on by the newspapers, which are\r\ngenerally considered to be owned by you, or influenced by you,\r\nhowever much they may forward certain interests, still, in the end,\r\ndid infinite harm to the existing interests of all sections of the\r\npopulation. Through the continual and incessant agitation and\r\ncreation of suspicion on the part of the papers, the public mind was\r\nconstantly in a state of insecurity, and the fanning of the race\r\nhatred made it impossible for the Government as well as the\r\nlegislature to improve the relations between the so-called Uitlanders\r\nand the old population.\r\n\r\nWe requested your friendly assistance also in the settlement of the\r\ncoolie question, not because we wanted to cause friction between you\r\nand other foreign governments, but only because the policy which\r\nrefers to the native and coloured questions is of the utmost\r\nimportance to South Africa.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippert had in his programme the granting of a promise on your\r\nside that you would support the Government in the obtaining of a loan\r\nwhich the Government may deem necessary, and that you should bind\r\nyourselves in writing to abstain from all political organizations\r\ninimical to the Government.\r\n\r\nThese matters we did not discuss, as we considered them unnecessary\r\nand inadvisable. From your side you deemed it necessary, before\r\nanswering us, first to receive the instructions of your foreign\r\nprincipals. Before you could give us the result the President\r\nexplained his intentions at Heidelberg, and afterwards at Rustenburg\r\nand Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nYour letter, now under consideration, contains practically a definite\r\nanswer to our communication to you. I shall now consider the points\r\nof your answer separately.\r\n\r\nBEWAARPLAATSEN.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this matter, we think that the undermining rights\r\nunder bewaarplaatsen, machine stands, and water-rights should be\r\nvalued on a reasonable basis, independently by the Government, and by\r\nthe owner of the surface rights (should there be a difference which\r\ncannot be settled amicably, then the value can be fixed by\r\narbitration), and that the surface owner shall have the preferent\r\nright to purchase the affected under-mining right at such a\r\nvaluation. From your communication I understand that you suggest a\r\nspecial method of valuation. That is a detail which can be settled\r\nwhen the valuation is actually commenced, and which experts are\r\nbetter able to judge over than I am. Therefore I shall say no more on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nFINANCIER AND AUDITOR.\r\n\r\nOn this subject our opinion was that the auditor should be\r\nindependent of the Government, and alone responsible to the Volksraad\r\nto appoint as financier a man of standing, with a seat in the\r\nExecutive Council, to advise on all matters affecting finances.\r\n\r\nI am glad to see that you are with us, and that it gives you great\r\nsatisfaction. I must express my surprise, however, over your proposal\r\nthat previous to the appointment this Government must first get the\r\napproval of Lord Rothschild or any other capitalist. I can only\r\nanswer that it is in no wise the intention of the Government to frame\r\nthe future financial policy of this State on a capitalistic basis,\r\nand thus your request cannot be agreed to. It is quite possible to\r\nmake such an appointment which will carry general approval without\r\nbeing subjected to such a mutual condition.\r\n\r\nLOAN, PRESS AGITATION, POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nWith reference to these matters, I have already made it plain to you\r\nthat in following the proposals of Mr. Lippert by cabling to your\r\nprincipals, you acted under a misunderstanding. We requested no\r\nbinding declaration from you, only a moral understanding, which would\r\nbe easy for you to maintain, if it was in the interests of the\r\nUitlanders as well as the burghers of the Republic. I regret that the\r\nmistake has arisen, otherwise I cannot see that any objection can\r\ncome from your side to approve of the plans of the President.\r\n\r\nDYNAMITE.\r\n\r\nOn this question there is a small difference between the proposed\r\npolicy of the President and your answer.\r\n\r\nI only wish to add that his Honour goes further than you do, as he\r\nhas declared his readiness to expropriate the Dynamite Company, under\r\nagreement with its representatives, as soon as possible. If the\r\nexpropriation takes place after the expiration of the present\r\nconcession then it will naturally not be on the basis of a going\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nFRANCHISE.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I can well understand that you do not wish to take\r\nupon your shoulders the responsibility of speaking and acting for the\r\nwhole of the new population. It was more your personal opinions as\r\nmen of position that we wished to know. Then again, according to your\r\nassurance at the aforementioned meeting, you do not take any personal\r\ninterest in the franchise question, and that you would rather leave\r\nthe question to the public; your answer is therefore perfectly fair.\r\nHis Honour has therefore already acted in accordance with your idea,\r\nfor he has brought the question of the franchise very prominently\r\nbefore the public, not only at Heidelberg and Rustenburg, but also at\r\nJohannesburg.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to one matter which has caused me much\r\npain. It was clearly and distinctly agreed and understood by you all\r\nas well as by us that both sides would treat this matter as\r\nconfidential and secret, as discussions of such important matters\r\ncannot be carried on with any results on the tops of houses. What has\r\nhappened? On the 28th of March I received your letter, and on the 3rd\r\nof April, whilst I was yet giving it earnest consideration and had\r\ntaken all the measures to keep it secret, the contents of the same\r\nappeared in the London _Times_, while some days later your answer\r\nappeared in full in the _Cape Times_, the _Diamond Fields\r\nAdvertiser_, and other papers under the influence of the capitalists.\r\nThe manner in which these papers favourable to you, or controlled by\r\nyou, have dealt with me in this matter has caused me (I admit it with\r\nregret) to doubt for one moment your good faith. Thinking, however,\r\nof the great interest as it were in the balance, and believing,\r\nmoreover, that you never for private or party purposes intended to\r\nplay with the true and lasting interests of all sections of the\r\ncommunity, I cannot help thinking that the reply has been published\r\nthrough one of your subordinates, and regret that the publication has\r\nnot been immediately repudiated by you publicly as a grave breach of\r\nfaith. I would regret it, while there exists so few points of\r\ndifference between us, that these things should bar the way through\r\ncareless and wrong tactics to a permanent understanding, and trust\r\nthat the hand extended to the Industry in absolute good faith will\r\nnot be slighted purposely and wilfully. Owing to the publication of\r\nyour reply, there exists no further reason for secrecy, and I shall\r\nhand my reply to the press.\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n                  F.W. REITZ,\r\n                     _State Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThe repudiation of Mr. Lippert's \"official\" character; the contention\r\nthat the State Secretary, State Attorney, and Dr. Leyds could divest\r\nthemselves of all responsibility in negotiations such as these, and\r\nclaim to have been acting in their private capacity only; and the\r\nextraordinary anxiety to keep secret matters which deeply affected\r\nthe public, and to the settlement of which the Government designed\r\nthat the public should be committed, compelled the negotiators to\r\nproduce evidence that the statements and conclusions of the\r\nGovernment were not warranted by the facts. The following letter,\r\nwhich was formally acknowledged but never answered, practically\r\nconcluded the negotiations:--\r\n\r\n  JOHANNESBURG, S.A.R., _April 14, 1899._\r\n\r\n_To the Honourable the State Secretary, Pretoria._\r\n\r\nHONOURABLE SIR,--\r\n\r\nWe have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication\r\nof the 8th April, 1899.\r\n\r\nCertain of our statements being doubted and described as erroneous in\r\nyour letter, we deem it advisable to go more fully into the facts\r\nwhich have preceded and led to this correspondence.\r\n\r\nIt may be that communications exchanged through an intermediary have\r\nbeen transmitted in a manner liable to convey a different impression\r\nfrom what was actually meant, and in order to clear any possible\r\nmisunderstanding, we beg to enclose copies of all documents supplied\r\nto us by Mr. Lippert, whom we, at all times, considered as your\r\nauthorized agent.\r\n\r\nFrom these it will be apparent that during the negotiations we acted\r\nin perfect good faith, communicating and discussing what we justly\r\nconsidered were the wishes and proposals of the Government, and it\r\nwill also be clear to you that every one of our statements is based\r\non documents which we had every reason to believe were approved of by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nOn February 27th Mr. Lippert called together Messrs. E. Birkenruth,\r\nA. Brakhan, and G. Rouliot, to whom he stated that a settlement of\r\ncertain pending questions could probably be arrived at. He said that\r\nhe had ascertained the views of Dr. Leyds, Messrs. Reitz and Smuts,\r\nwho had agreed to a certain programme, and he wanted to know whether\r\nwe would be willing to open negotiations on that basis, in which case\r\nthe three officials mentioned would see the State President and\r\nascertain whether he would be prepared to adopt their views.\r\n\r\nIf the State President's approval could be obtained, Mr. Lippert\r\nsuggested that a conference should be held to discuss the subjects\r\nmentioned in his memorandum.\r\n\r\nThis memorandum (Annexure 'A'), as explained to us by Mr. Lippert,\r\nenumerates under Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive the points which the\r\nGovernment expected us to concede, and the other clauses are what the\r\nGovernment proposed doing in return.\r\n\r\nWe were then informed that the programme must be considered as a\r\nwhole, and either adopted or rejected as such, no question being\r\nconsidered separately, and that the matter must be kept absolutely\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nUpon our statement that we personally would be willing to open\r\nnegotiations on the basis suggested, Mr. Lippert went to Pretoria and\r\ninformed the high officials above-named.\r\n\r\nOn March 1st Mr. Lippert informed us that the State President was\r\nviewing the matter favourably, and requested us to acquaint our\r\nfriends by cable.\r\n\r\nOur replies having been communicated to Mr. Lippert, a meeting was\r\narranged on March 9th, as recited in our previous letter, at which,\r\nMr. Lippert informed us, no new subject outside of those mentioned in\r\nhis memorandum could be discussed.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Pistorius and Pierce, being invited by Mr. Lippert to attend\r\nthe meeting, were each supplied by him with a list of the questions\r\nto be discussed, forming part of the proposed settlement (Annexure\r\n'B').\r\n\r\nOn March 12th Mr. Lippert communicated to us what he termed the\r\ndefinite proposals of the Government of the S.A.R., which were duly\r\ncabled to our friends in Europe (a copy of this cable has already\r\nbeen sent to you).\r\n\r\nHe also read to us the declaration, which he suggested we should sign\r\non behalf of ourselves and our European friends (Annexure 'C').\r\n\r\nA speedy reply to our cable was asked for, as Mr. Lippert had\r\ninformed us that, if any settlement could be arrived at, the\r\nagreement had to be submitted to the Honourable the First Volksraad\r\nbefore the closing of the extraordinary session which was drawing\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nWe beg to point out to you that by cabling these proposals to Europe,\r\nwe could not possibly conceive that we were acting under a\r\nmisconception, as the day on which they were made to us, the 12th of\r\nMarch, being a Sunday, the Telegraph Office was specially kept\r\nopen for the purpose of dispatching the cables, which were duly\r\nreceived and forwarded upon production of an order from Mr. Lippert.\r\n\r\nIn our letter of March 17th to his Honour the State President,\r\nconveying the nature of our friends' reply, we mentioned the fact\r\nthat the communication made to us by Mr. Lippert on behalf of the\r\nGovernment had been fully cabled; we stated that our friends no doubt\r\nbased their suggestion to further discuss the whole of the proposals\r\nwith Dr. Leyds upon the fact that the Government had stipulated that\r\nthey should become parties to the proposed settlement.\r\n\r\nIn your reply of March 18th, no exception is taken to these\r\nstatements; you tell us, on behalf of his Honour the State President,\r\n'that the exchange of views can best take place direct with the\r\nGovernment, and here, within the Republic,' pointing out the fact\r\n'that the session of the Volksraad was close at hand, and that\r\ntherefore further delay is undesirable.'\r\n\r\nYou will thus see that we were perfectly justified in thinking that\r\nthe communications made to our European friends, embodied the\r\nproposals of the Government of the South African Republic, were\r\ncabled with the knowledge and approval of the Government, and that\r\nwe were requested to sign a declaration on behalf of ourselves and\r\nour friends, which declaration had to be made public.\r\n\r\nOur letter of the 27th March conveyed to you our opinion and that of\r\nour friends, upon the subjects comprised in the programme which was\r\nsubmitted to us, and it is unnecessary to go over them in detail\r\nagain. We beg only to offer a few remarks upon certain points raised\r\nin your letter of 8th April:--Bewaarplaatsen: We suggest a basis for\r\nthe valuation of bewaarplaatsen, machine stands, and water-rights,\r\nwhich in our opinion ought to be adopted, in order to have a uniform\r\nand easy method of valuing these places.\r\n\r\nFinancier: Being fully aware of the complexity of financial problems\r\nand questions of taxation in this State, we are anxious that the\r\nfinancier appointed should be of such a standing as to command the\r\nconfidence of all, so that his recommendations cannot raise any\r\nulterior discussion. For that reason we expressed the opinion that,\r\nbefore making the appointment, the Government should be guided in its\r\nchoice by someone belonging to a firm of well-known independent\r\nstanding. We have no desire to see this Government base its future\r\nfinancial policy on any particular line, in the interest of, or\r\ndirected against, any special section of the people. We only wish to\r\nsee the financial policy established on sound recognized economic\r\nprinciples, with fair and equitable taxation calculated according to\r\nthe proper requirements of the State.\r\n\r\nPress Agitation--Political Organizations: We have already informed\r\nyou, that so far as we know, there has been no organized press\r\nagitation, and that we should be willing at all times to deprecate\r\nthe stirring up of strife between nationalities caused by any agency\r\nwhatsoever. We consider it desirable to see that feeling more\r\ngeneral, as we are convinced that exaggerated press campaigns\r\nconducted by newspapers generally reported to be influenced by the\r\nGovernment, and tending to create dissension amongst the various\r\nclasses of the community, are calculated to cause an infinite amount\r\nof harm to the vested interests of all sections of the population.\r\n\r\nDynamite: In your letter of the 8th April, you appear to have lost\r\nsight of the fact that the proposed settlement was submitted to us as\r\na whole. Mr. Lippert made it clear that, in consideration of the\r\nGovernment granting the measures enumerated in his memorandum, it was\r\nexpected that we should abandon our present contentions, and declare\r\nourselves satisfied with the settlement proposed by the Government.\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances this would be far from meeting our\r\ndesires, but we intimated to you that we should be willing to\r\nrecommend to the mining industry the adoption of the proposals made\r\nto us on this subject, if by so doing we could promote a permanent\r\nsatisfactory solution of all pending questions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we beg to refer to the publication of our previous\r\nletter to you. It took place here on the 6th inst., in the afternoon;\r\nwe immediately instituted an inquiry, and on the 8th inst., in the\r\nmorning, we wrote that we were in a position to assure you that we\r\ncould in no way be held responsible for the publication. We never for\r\na moment doubted your good faith, nor that of the other gentlemen for\r\nwhom the letter was meant, but thought that possibly the\r\ncommunication could have been made through one of your subordinates.\r\nHowever, not being certain of the fact, we merely repudiated any\r\nresponsibility on our part, and regret that you should have publicly\r\nlaid the blame on our side, without having communicated with us,\r\nasking for an explanation, if you had any suspicion.\r\n\r\nWe beg to assure you that we are as willing as ever to co-operate\r\nwith you in arriving at a settlement of all pending differences in\r\norder to secure peace and prosperity in this country, and we shall be\r\nready at all times to meet and discuss with you, or any other\r\ndelegates of the Government, any matter likely to bring about a\r\nspeedy and permanent solution of all questions, still bearing in mind\r\nwhat we mentioned in our previous correspondence, that we are not\r\nqualified to speak on behalf of the whole community.\r\n\r\nAs you have informed us that you have no objection to it, we shall\r\ngive a copy of this letter to the press.\r\n\r\nWe have the honour to be, honourable Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servants,\r\n                G. ROULIOT,\r\n                JOHN M. PIERCE,\r\n                A. BRAKHAN,\r\n                E.

Thereupon the subscribed parties from Johannesburg, for\r\nthemselves, and for the parties they represent here and in Europe,\r\ndeclared:--\r\n\r\n'The passing by the Volksraad of the laws to be submitted by the\r\nGovernment during this session,--\r\n\r\n'For the appointment during the present year of a Financial Adviser\r\nto the Government, of European reputation, who shall have a seat and\r\na vote in the Executive Council on all financial matters.\r\n\r\n'For placing the Auditor-General on the same status _re_ dismissal as\r\nthe Judges, and for making him responsible directly to the Volksraad,\r\nit being agreed that until such Financial Adviser has laid his budget\r\nproposals before the Government, no fresh taxation shall be laid upon\r\nthe mining industry, nor any other direct taxation.\r\n\r\n'For granting the undermining rights under bewaarplaatsen, machine\r\nstands, and water-rights, to the present holders of the licences,\r\ncovering such reserved areas at a moderate valuation; such valuation\r\nto be arrived at in the following manner: The Government to appoint a\r\nvaluator, with instructions to value these rights at a fair and\r\nmoderate valuation, the holder of the surface licence to appoint a\r\nvaluator; if they agree, then the surface licence holder shall have\r\nthe first right to the undermining rights at such valuation; if the\r\ntwo valuators cannot agree about a valuation, they shall appoint\r\ntogether an umpire; if they cannot agree about an umpire, the Chief\r\njustice of the High Court shall be asked to appoint an umpire; the\r\ndecision of such umpire shall be final as to the value of the area\r\nunder arbitration. If the holder of the surface licence refuses to\r\npurchase at the said valuation, the Government shall be at liberty to\r\ndispose of it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n'For a permanent settlement of the dynamite question on one or the\r\nother bases following, namely, that the _status quo_ remain in force\r\ntill the end of the contract period, the Government making use of its\r\nright to revise the prices under the terms of the agreement or that\r\nthe Dynamite Company reduce the price by 5s. to 70s. for No. 1 and to\r\n90s. for blasting gelatine, the Government undertaking to take over\r\nthe works of the Dynamite Company at the end of the agreement at a\r\nvaluation as provided by the offer now before the Volksraad.\r\n\r\n'For an extension of the franchise to all white aliens in this State,\r\nin the following manner: That naturalization be granted to all\r\nseeking it, who have resided in the State for two years and who are\r\nof good behaviour and who have not suffered any dishonourable\r\nsentence by any Court, upon taking the oath of allegiance as\r\nprescribed by the existing law; upon such naturalization he shall be\r\nentitled to elect a member to the Second Volksraad, and two years\r\nafter shall be entitled to be elected as a member of the Second\r\nVolksraad. A period of seven years having elapsed after\r\nnaturalization, he shall by virtue of that lapse of time and without\r\nfurther hindrance obtain full burgher rights, the Government,\r\nhowever, reserve to themselves the right (in order to secure the\r\npassing of such law through the Volksraad of this and that of the\r\nsession of 1900) to extend the period of naturalization for the right\r\nof voting for the election of a President. Children of naturalized\r\naliens, who attain their majority when their father has obtained full\r\nburgher rights, have _ipso facto_ the same rights as the father. The\r\nGovernment shall also have the right to attach a moderate property\r\nqualification to the obtaining of these extended franchise rights. It\r\nis understood that by the laws of the State, this extended franchise\r\ncan only finally be granted by the Volksraad in session 1900, after\r\nthe law has been submitted to the people for twelve months, but that\r\nthe period of 9 resp. 7 years shall date from the passing of the\r\nresolution to be passed by the Volksraad now in session.\r\n\r\nwill be hailed by us with great satisfaction as removing all\r\nobstacles to a friendly and peaceful development of mutual\r\nunderstanding and co-operation; it is our wish, and in the interest\r\nof those we represent, that the public in Europe and in South Africa\r\nbe made fully aware hereof by means of the press, and that hostile\r\nagitation by means of the press here and elsewhere shall be avoided\r\nin future.\r\n\r\n'We deprecate all attempts that may be made by political agencies to\r\nstir up strife between the different nationalities inhabiting this\r\nState, and shall not be parties to any such organizations.\r\n\r\n'Seeing the many evils springing from indiscriminate immigration of\r\ncoloured races, and having been assured that the Government will do\r\nall in its power to facilitate in other ways the supply of labour, we\r\nsupport the Government in its contention that the regulations\r\nconcerning the treatment of \"coolies and other coloured races\" had\r\nbest be left to them as a matter of internal concern.\r\n\r\n'We will support the placing of a State loan recommended by the\r\nFinancier in the European markets at reasonable rates, if the\r\nGovernment should desire us to do so in the common interest.\r\n\r\n'Seeing the great value the Government evidently sets upon a friendly\r\nand permanent settlement of the dynamite question, which has\r\ncontributed so much to disturbing the good relations, we declare\r\nourselves satisfied with the final settlement arrived at.\r\n\r\n'And should, after the passing of the above proposals of law as a\r\nwhole by the Volksraad, the Government desire us to give publicity to\r\nthis our declaration for the promotion of peace and goodwill, such\r\npublicity as the Government may desire shall be given thereto.'\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiations were actually in progress, and while the\r\nImperial Government were awaiting a reply to their dispatch, the\r\nPresident made two determined attempts to rush the confirmation of\r\nthe dynamite monopoly through the Raad. The first proposal was for\r\nthe fifteen years' extension, and the second provided for condonation\r\nof all breaches of the concession in the past and for compensation\r\nupon the expiry of the concession.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlanders had not failed to perceive that the pit dug for them\r\nmight conceivably serve another purpose. They ignored these two\r\nbreaches of faith on the part of the President, and pursued the\r\nnegotiations; and Mr. Kruger overreached himself. Having failed with\r\nJohannesburg, and having failed in the Raad, he appealed to his\r\nburghers with the scheme of mock reform. His hope was to get such\r\nsupport in the country that the Volksraad in its May session would\r\nhave to spare the monopoly. He did not realize that he would have to\r\nmake good the things which he had offered as shams. His greed had\r\ngiven the opening: his hand had provided the weapon. It is not good\r\nto be too clever; and the luck had turned.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the correspondence between the Government and the\r\ncapitalists created a profound impression. The series of speeches\r\ndelivered by the President in support of his sham reforms only\r\ndeepened that impression by providing more and more convincing\r\nevidence as to who the real intriguers and mischief-makers were. To\r\nthe Uitlander public one thing became quite clear, and that was that\r\nit was the Government who wished to barter their rights away and the\r\ncapitalists--the abused capitalists--who refused to do so. An attempt\r\nwas immediately made to hold a large public meeting for the purpose\r\nof endorsing the attitude taken by the negotiators, but the\r\nGovernment refused permission to hold an open-air meeting. In their\r\nattempt to hold a meeting indoors, the Uitlanders were defeated by\r\nthe building being condemned as unsafe. The Government yielded,\r\nhowever, before the storm of disapproval which followed their\r\nprohibition, and the State Secretary, Mr. Reitz, suggested that the\r\nUitlanders should hold a series of small indoor meetings in different\r\nlocalities. The meetings were accordingly held, and they provided\r\nunmistakable evidence of the gravity of the position. By their\r\nnumbers, their unanimity, their enthusiasm, and their moderation,\r\nthe Uitlanders carried conviction to some and roused the grave\r\napprehension of others. Among the latter, it is fair to infer, were\r\nPresident Kruger and his sympathizers in the Free State and Cape\r\nColony.\r\n\r\nThere is one disability the existence of which the advocates of the\r\nUitlander cause are always painfully conscious of. They know as well\r\nas any of their critics that it is no picture which is all\r\nblack--that you get no perspective, no effects, without contrasts!\r\nYet it has not been believed that they were willing to acknowledge\r\nthe good that there was, and that a politic instinct no less than a\r\nsense of justice prompted a diligent effort to discover and make much\r\nof the genuinely hopeful signs. The monotony was none of their\r\nmaking; it was in the nature of the facts, and not of the recital;\r\nbut monotony there was, and it was productive of one very bad result.\r\nThe conditions, admittedly bad, came to be regarded by a good many as\r\nbeing only as bad as they had for a long time been known to be,\r\nleaving little hope except through the long slow influence of time,\r\nbut causing no immediate anxiety or alarm. Someday a grubbing\r\nhistorian may read the back files of South African newspapers and\r\nmarvel that such warnings should have passed unheeded, but the fact\r\nis that the Transvaal Government and its sympathizers had become\r\nindifferent to warnings followed by no results and accustomed to\r\nprophecies unfulfilled. To say that they were 'fiddling while Rome\r\nburned' is to a great extent true of those of the South African Dutch\r\nwho were sincerely desirous that the Transvaal Government should\r\nreform its ways and who were not consciously aiding in the\r\nrepublicanizing movement; but even of them it is not an adequate\r\ndescription,--as the answers given to two questioners by the most\r\nprominent and one of the most prominent Bondsmen indicate. Both of\r\nthem had in private conversation on different occasions acknowledged\r\nthe soundness of the Uitlander cause. To the suggestion, 'Then why\r\nnot say so publicly?' the less important of the two replied, 'People\r\nwould only say that I am climbing down and ratting on my party.' And\r\nthe more important of the two, answering a similar question, said,\r\n'Yes, the Rev. S.J. Du Toit did that. He was the founder of the\r\nBond; and to-day he is--nothing! If I did it, I should fall as he\r\ndid.' 'Then,' said his British friend, 'what is influence worth if it\r\ncannot be used for good? Can there be said to be influence when it\r\ncannot be used at all?' 'No,' was the reply, 'I have no influence as\r\nagainst the cry of race: blood is thicker than water; and I have no\r\ninfluence at all with Kruger.' The answer to this contained the crux\r\nof the question. 'Indeed you have; but you have not the courage to\r\nexercise it. The influence of advice has failed, dare you try the\r\ninfluence of repudiation?' The answer was a shake of the head and\r\n'Blood is thicker than water.' That is it! The Piper pipes and the\r\nchildren follow.\r\n\r\nIt is too much to believe that the conference between the High\r\nCommissioner and President Kruger was a suggestion to which the\r\nlatter had to be won over either by President Steyn or Mr. Hofmeyr.\r\nIt is, indeed, well-known that the idea of a meeting for the purpose\r\nof discussing matters at issue between the two Governments had been\r\nconsidered in Pretoria for some months before it actually took\r\nplace.{51}\r\n\r\nThe news that, upon the invitation of President Steyn, the High\r\nCommissioner and President Kruger had agreed to meet at Bloemfontein,\r\nwas received by the Uitlanders with relief; not hope, because it was\r\nbelieved that the President's object was to get something, not to\r\ngive something; but sheer relief, because, come what might, the\r\nposition could never again be the same as it was before the\r\nconference. Something must change; someone must yield; the unbearable\r\nstrain must cease. Sir Alfred Milner--wise and just and\r\nstrong--commanded the entire confidence of the Uitlanders. It was not\r\nhoped that he would succeed in effecting a settlement at such a\r\nmeeting, because in the circumstances such an achievement was\r\nbelieved not to be humanly possible; but it was not feared that he\r\nwould fail in his duty to his country and to his trust.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the object of this volume to deal with the\r\nnegotiations which took place at Bloemfontein or with the terms of\r\nsettlement at the present moment under discussion; the object is to\r\nrecite the circumstances and conditions which made these negotiations\r\nnecessary, and which, if they fail, must lead to bloodshed.\r\n\r\nWith a barrier of insurmountable race feeling before them, the\r\nUitlanders are hopeless of effecting a peaceful redress of their\r\ngrievances except by the aid of the Suzerain power. The President and\r\nhis party will not yield one iota except upon the advice of those who\r\nhave the will and the power to see that that advice is followed. Such\r\npower rests in two quarters. It rests with the progressive Dutch of\r\nSouth Africa. They have the power, but unfortunately they have not as\r\nyet the will or they have not the courage to use it. Time after time\r\nhave they been stultified by rallying to the cry of race and\r\ndefending Mr. Kruger's attitude on certain points, only to find the\r\nPresident abandoning as untenable the position which they have\r\nproclaimed to be proper. To them have been addressed most earnest and\r\nmost solemn appeals to be up and doing whilst there was yet time.\r\nFrom them have been extracted--in times of peace--the amplest\r\nadmissions of the justice of the Uitlander case. But there is a point\r\nbeyond which they will not go. They will not say to the President and\r\nhis party: 'We cannot extol in you what we would condemn in\r\nourselves. The claim of kindred cannot for ever be the stalking-horse\r\nfor injustice.' That they cannot do; and thus are they bonded to the\r\none who will raise the race cry without scruple. There is no more\r\nhopeless feature for the peaceful settlement of the Transvaal\r\nquestion from within than the unanimity which marks the public\r\nutterances of those who are claimed as representing Afrikander\r\nsentiment in the present crisis. Those expressions, ranging from the\r\nmost violent denunciations by politicians and ministers of the gospel\r\ndown to the most illogical and hysterical appeals of public writers,\r\nall, all are directed against the injured. Not a warning, not a\r\nhint--not a prayer even--addressed to the offender. They have not the\r\nsense of justice to see or they have not the courage to denounce the\r\nperpetrators of evil, but direct all their efforts to hushing the\r\ncomplaints of the victims. Truly it would almost appear that there\r\nis some guiding principle running through it all; something which\r\nrecognizes the real sinner in the victim who complains and not in\r\nthe villain who perpetrates; the something which found a concrete\r\nexpression when bail was fixed at £200 for the murder of a British\r\nsubject and at £1,000 for the crime of objecting to it.\r\n\r\nNo civilized body of men ever had more just cause for complaint than\r\nthe Uitlanders of the Transvaal have, but they carry on their reform\r\nmovement under very difficult and discouraging conditions. Those who\r\nhave petitioned their Sovereign to secure for them some amelioration\r\nof their lot are branded by the head of the State as rebels for so\r\ndoing, and his example is followed by all his party. Those men who\r\norganized or addressed the public meetings which were suggested by\r\nMr. Reitz, the State Secretary, and held for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing a proposal publicly made by the Government, are the men\r\nwhom Messrs. Dieperink and Viljoen, the members representing\r\nJohannesburg in the First and Second Volksraads, denounced as\r\ntraitors who should be summarily dealt with by the Government.\r\nBritish subjects associated with the Uitlander cause who venture to\r\ncall upon the British Agent in Pretoria or the High Commissioner in\r\nCape Town are regarded as conspirators and are watched by spies and\r\nall their movements are reported to the Transvaal Government.{52} The\r\nrecognized leaders among the Uitlanders are black-listed in the Dutch\r\npress, their names, addresses, and occupations given so that they may\r\nbe identified,--marked down in the newspapers supported by the\r\nGovernment--as men to be dragged out and shot without trial.\r\nUitlander newspapers have been suppressed for mere political reasons,\r\nwithout even the allegation that there was incitement to violence or\r\ndisorder, and it is therefore not unreasonable that the impunity\r\nwith which the Dutch newspapers continue this campaign month after\r\nmonth should be taken as the measure of the Government's complicity.\r\n\r\nIt is in these circumstances that appeal has been made to England,\r\nthe only other quarter in which there rests the power to see that\r\njustice shall be done. It is an appeal which might well be based upon\r\nthe broad and acknowledged right of a subject to claim in case of\r\ninjustice the good offices of his own Government. But here it is\r\nbased upon a special right. It is the _spirit_{53} of the Pretoria\r\nConvention which the Uitlander has invoked for many years, only to be\r\ntold that the spirit is as it may be interpreted from the letter. But\r\nit is not so! Will it be suggested that the British Government\r\ncontemplated such license when they granted the charter of\r\nself-government to the Transvaal or that they would have granted\r\nit had they foreseen the interpretation? Can it be said that Mr.\r\nKruger and his colleagues contemplated it or would have dared to avow\r\nthe intention if it were ever entertained? No! And he will be a\r\nbolder man than Mr. Kruger who will dispute that answer; for the\r\nPresident's own defence is, not that he had the intention or has the\r\nright to differentiate between races and between classes; but--that\r\nhe does not differentiate. So that the issue is narrowed to this,\r\nthat it is merely a question of fact!\r\n\r\nBut the appeal of British subjects in the Transvaal will claim a\r\nhearing for other reasons too! Only the blindest can fail to realize\r\nhow much is at stake, materially and morally, or can fail to see what\r\nis the real issue, and how the Mother Country stands on trial before\r\nall her children, who are the Empire. Only those who do not count\r\nwill refuse to face the responsibility in all seriousness, or will\r\nfail to receive in the best spirit the timely reminder of past\r\nneglect. If the reproaching truth be a hard thing to hear, it is, for\r\nthose whose every impulse jumps towards championing the great Home\r\nLand, a far, far harder thing to say. Unpleasant it may be, but not\r\nwithout good, that England's record in South Africa--of subjects\r\nabandoned and of rights ignored, of duty neglected and of pledge\r\nunkept, of lost prestige and slipping Empire--should speak to quicken\r\na memory and rouse the native sense of right, so that a nation's\r\nconscience will say 'Be just before you are generous! Be just to\r\nall--even to your own!'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes for Chapter XI\r\n\r\n{49} It is stated that President Kruger, ever since the signing of\r\nthe London Convention on Majuba Day--February 27--1884, has believed\r\nin certain lucky days, and has a kind of superstitious regard for\r\nanniversaries. If that be so, the incidence of events has given him\r\nsomething to ponder over during the last three years. Three notable\r\nschemes conceived by himself and carefully designed to strengthen his\r\nposition, have by a curious coincidence matured upon dates of certain\r\ninterest in Transvaal history. All three have failed disastrously.\r\nThe first anniversary of the Reformers' sentence day was the occasion\r\nof the Reformers giving evidence before the Industrial Commission,\r\nwhich so strongly justified their case. The Peace Negotiations with\r\nthe Capitalists were opened by Mr. Lippert upon the anniversary of\r\nMajuba. The Bloemfontein Conference was opened upon the Reformers'\r\nemancipation day, the expiry of the three years' silence. That his\r\nHonour really attaches importance to these things was shown when over\r\ntwo hundred ministers representing the Dutch Reformed Church in the\r\nTransvaal met in Pretoria to urge upon him the suppression of the\r\nIllicit Liquor trade. In all innocence they had chosen May 24 on\r\nwhich to present their address. Their astonishment was great when Mr.\r\nKruger, passing lightly by the liquor question, gave the assembled\r\npastors a thorough wigging for finding fault with his administration\r\nat all, but chiefly for their unpatriotic conduct in selecting the\r\nQueen's birthday of all days on which to expose internal differences\r\nin their country.\r\n\r\n{50} In addressing a meeting of burghers in Heidelburg three months\r\nlater the President showed to what lengths he was prepared to go in\r\ndefending the monopoly when in reply to a question he denied that any\r\nsuch offer had been received '_by the Executive.'_ The explanation,\r\nwhich he did not give, is that the _Government, i.e.,_ the President\r\nand State Secretary, had received it--and withheld it from the\r\nExecutive!\r\n\r\n{51} In March the writer made the suggestion to a representative of\r\nthe Pretoria Government in the hope of getting rid by a 'square talk'\r\nof the many and ever-increasing differences, and was informed that\r\nthe idea had often been discussed and as often abandoned, because it\r\ncontained the objectionable feature of establishing a precedent for\r\nEngland's interference in internal affairs.\r\n\r\n{52} When on a visit to Cape Town in April, the writer called\r\nseveral times upon the High Commissioner, and learning by private\r\nadvice that his movements were being reported in detail through the\r\nSecret Service Department, he informed Sir Alfred Milner of the fact.\r\nSir Alfred admitted that the idea of secret agents in British\r\nterritory and spies round or in Government House was not pleasant,\r\nbut expressed the hope that such things should not deter those who\r\nwished to call on him, as he was there as the representative of her\r\nMajesty for the benefit of British subjects and very desirous of\r\nascertaining for himself the facts of the case.\r\n\r\n{53} Since this was written, Mr. Chamberlain, speaking in the House\r\nof Commons on July 28, 1899, has thus disposed of the question:--\r\n\r\n'It has been broken in the spirit more than it has been broken in the\r\nletter. The whole spirit of the convention is the preservation of\r\nequality as between all the white inhabitants of the Transvaal, and\r\nthe whole policy of the Transvaal has been to promote a position of\r\ninferiority on the part of certain classes. There is something even\r\nmore striking than that. The conventions were, of course, the result\r\nof a previous conference. At that conference definite promises were\r\nmade which made it impossible to doubt with what object the\r\nconvention was signed. On May 10, 1881, at a conference between\r\nrepresentatives of her Majesty and representatives of the Transvaal\r\nthe President, Sir Hercules Robinson, asked this question:--\r\n\r\n'\"Before annexation had British subjects complete freedom of trade\r\nthroughout the Transvaal? Were they on the same footing as citizens\r\nof the Transvaal?\r\n\r\n'\"Mr. Kruger replied: They were on the same footing as the burghers.\r\nThere was not the slightest difference in accordance with the Sand\r\nRiver Convention.\r\n\r\n'\"Sir Hercules Robinson: I presume you will not object to that\r\ncontinuing?\r\n\r\n'\"Mr. Kruger: No. There will be equal protection for everybody.\r\n\r\n'\"Sir Evelyn Wood: And equal privileges.\r\n\r\n'\"Mr. Kruger: We make no difference so far as burgher rights are\r\nconcerned. There may, perhaps, be some slight difference in the case\r\nof a young person who has just come into the country.\"\r\n\r\n(Cheers.) 'Now, there is a distinct promise given by the man who is\r\nnow President of the Transvaal State that, so far as burgher rights\r\nwere concerned, they made and would make no difference whatever\r\nbetween burghers and those who came in. The root of the difficulty\r\nwhich I have been describing lies in the fact that this promise has\r\nnot been kept.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nPRETORIA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nCONVENTION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE TRANSVAAL TERRITORY.\r\n\r\n  _August, 1881._\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Commissioners for the Settlement of the Transvaal\r\nterritory, duly appointed as such by a Commission passed under the\r\nRoyal Sign Manual and Signet, bearing date the 5th of April, 1881, do\r\nhereby undertake and guarantee on behalf of Her Majesty that, from\r\nand after the 8th day of August, 1881, complete self-government,\r\nsubject to the suzerainty of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors,\r\nwill be accorded to the inhabitants of the Transvaal territory, upon\r\nthe following terms and conditions, and subject to the following\r\nreservations and limitations:--\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nThe said territory, to be hereinafter called the Transvaal State,\r\nwill embrace the land lying between the following boundaries, to wit:\r\n[here follow three pages in print defining boundaries.]\r\n\r\nARTICLE II.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty reserves to herself, her heirs and successors, (_a_) the\r\nright from time to time to appoint a British Resident in and for the\r\nsaid State, with such duties and functions as are hereinafter\r\ndefined; (_b_) the right to move troops through the said State in\r\ntime of war, or in case of the apprehension of immediate war between\r\nthe Suzerain Power and any Foreign State or Native tribe in South\r\nAfrica; and (_c_) the control of the external relations of the said\r\nState, including the conclusion of treaties and the conduct of\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with Foreign Powers, such intercourse to be\r\ncarried on through Her Majesty's diplomatic and consular officers\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.\r\n\r\nUntil altered by the Volksraad, or other competent authority, all\r\nlaws, whether passed before or after the annexation of the Transvaal\r\nterritory to Her Majesty's dominions, shall, except in so far as they\r\nare inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of this\r\nConvention, be and remain in force in the said State in so far as\r\nthey shall be applicable thereto, provided that no future\r\nenactment especially affecting the interest of natives shall have\r\nany force or effect in the said State, without the consent of Her\r\nMajesty, her heirs and successors, first had and obtained and\r\nsignified to the Government of the said State through the British\r\nResident, provided further that in no case will the repeal or\r\namendment of any laws enacted since the annexation have a\r\nretrospective effect, so as to invalidate any acts done or\r\nliabilities incurred by virtue of such laws.\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of August, 1881, the Government of the said State,\r\ntogether with all rights and obligations thereto appertaining, and\r\nall State property taken over at the time of annexation, save and\r\nexcept munitions of war, will be handed over to Messrs. Stephanus\r\nJohannes Paulus Kruger, Martinus Wessel Pretorius, and Petrus Jacobus\r\nJoubert, or the survivor or survivors of them, who will forthwith\r\ncause a Volksraad to be elected and convened, and the Volksraad, thus\r\nelected and convened, will decide as to the further administration of\r\nthe Government of the said State.\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.\r\n\r\nAll sentences passed upon persons who may be convicted of offences\r\ncontrary to the rules of civilized warfare committed during the\r\nrecent hostilities will be duly carried out, and no alteration or\r\nmitigation of such sentences will be made or allowed by the\r\nGovernment of the Transvaal State without Her Majesty's consent\r\nconveyed through the British Resident. In case there shall be any\r\nprisoners in any of the gaols of the Transvaal State whose respective\r\nsentences of imprisonment have been remitted in part by Her Majesty's\r\nAdministrator or other officer administering the Government, such\r\nremission will be recognized and acted upon by the future Government\r\nof the said State.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government will make due compensation for all losses or\r\ndamage sustained by reason of such acts as are in the 8th Article\r\nhereinafter specified, which may have been committed by Her Majesty's\r\nforces during the recent hostilities, except for such losses or\r\ndamage as may already have been compensated for, and the Government\r\nof the Transvaal State will make due compensation for all losses or\r\ndamage sustained by reason of such acts as are in the 8th Article\r\nhereinafter specified which may have been committed by the people who\r\nwere in arms against Her Majesty during the recent hostilities,\r\nexcept for such losses or damages as may already have been\r\ncompensated for.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nThe decision of all claims for compensation, as in the last preceding\r\nArticle mentioned, will be referred to a Sub-Commission, consisting\r\nof the Honourable George Hudson, the Honourable Jacobus Petrus de\r\nWet, and the Honourable John Gilbert Kotzé. In case one or more of\r\nsuch Sub-Commissioners shall be unable or unwilling to act, the\r\nremaining Sub-Commissioner or Sub-Commissioners will, after\r\nconsultation with the Government of the Transvaal State, submit for\r\nthe approval of Her Majesty's High Commissioners the names of one or\r\nmore persons to be appointed by them to fill the place or places thus\r\nvacated. The decision of the said Sub-Commissioners, or of a majority\r\nof them, will be final. The said Sub-Commissioners will enter upon\r\nand perform their duties with all convenient speed. They will, before\r\ntaking evidence or ordering evidence to be taken in respect of any\r\nclaim, decide whether such claim can be entertained at all under the\r\nrules laid down in the next succeeding Article. In regard to claims\r\nwhich can be so entertained, the Sub-Commissioners will in the first\r\ninstance afford every facility for an amicable arrangement as to the\r\namount payable in respect of any claim, and only in cases in which\r\nthere is no reasonable ground for believing that an immediate\r\namicable arrangement can be arrived at will they take evidence or\r\norder evidence to be taken. For the purpose of taking evidence and\r\nreporting thereon, the Sub-Commissioners may appoint Deputies, who\r\nwill, without delay, submit records of the evidence and their reports\r\nto the Sub-Commissioners. The Sub-Commissioners will arrange their\r\nsittings and the sittings of their Deputies in such a manner as to\r\nafford the earliest convenience to the parties concerned and their\r\nwitnesses. In no case will costs be allowed to either side other than\r\nthe actual and reasonable expenses of witnesses whose evidence is\r\ncertified by the Sub-Commissioners to have been necessary. Interest\r\nwill not run on the amount of any claim, except as is hereinafter\r\nprovided for. The said Sub-Commissioners will forthwith, after\r\ndeciding upon any claim, announce their decision to the Government\r\nagainst which the award is made and to the claimant. The amount of\r\nremuneration payable to the Sub-Commissioners and their Deputies will\r\nbe determined by the High Commissioners. After all the claims have\r\nbeen decided upon, the British Government and the Government of\r\nthe Transvaal State will pay proportionate shares of the said\r\nremuneration and of the expenses of the Sub-Commissioners and their\r\nDeputies, according to the amount awarded against them respectively.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VIII.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of distinguishing claims to be accepted from those to\r\nbe rejected, the Sub-Commissioners will be guided by the following\r\nrules, viz.:--Compensation will be allowed for losses or damage\r\nsustained by reason of the following acts committed during the recent\r\nhostilities, viz.: _(a)_ commandeering, seizure, confiscation, or\r\ndestruction of property, or damage done to property; _(b)_ violence\r\ndone or threats used by persons in arms. In regard to acts under\r\n_(a)_, compensation will be allowed for direct losses only. In regard\r\nto acts falling under _(b)_, compensation will be allowed for actual\r\nlosses of property, or actual injury to the same proved to have been\r\ncaused by its enforced abandonment. No claims for indirect losses,\r\nexcept such as are in this Article especially provided for, will be\r\nentertained. No claims which have been handed in to the Secretary of\r\nthe Royal Commission after the 1st day of July, 1881, will be\r\nentertained, unless the Sub-Commissioners shall be satisfied that\r\nthe delay was reasonable. When claims for loss of property are\r\nconsidered, the Sub-Commissioners will require distinct proof of the\r\nexistence of the property, and that it neither has reverted nor will\r\nrevert to the claimant.\r\n\r\nARTICLE IX.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Transvaal State will pay and satisfy the amount\r\nof every claim awarded against it within one month after the\r\nSub-Commissioners shall have notified their decision to the said\r\nGovernment, and in default of such payment the said Government will\r\npay interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum from the date of\r\nsuch default; but Her Majesty's Government may at any time before\r\nsuch payment pay the amount, with interest, if any, to the claimant\r\nin satisfaction of his claim, and may add the sum thus paid to any\r\ndebt which may be due by the Transvaal State to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, as hereinafter provided for.\r\n\r\nARTICLE X.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal State will be liable for the balance of the debts for\r\nwhich the South African Republic was liable at the date of\r\nannexation, to wit, the sum of £48,000 in respect of the Cape\r\nCommercial Bank Loan, and £85,667 in respect of the Railway Loan,\r\ntogether with the amount due on 8th August, 1881, on account of the\r\nOrphan Chamber Debt, which now stands at £22,200, which debts will be\r\na first charge upon the revenues of the State. The Transvaal State\r\nwill, moreover, be liable for the lawful expenditure lawfully\r\nincurred for the necessary expenses of the Province since the\r\nannexation, to wit, the sum of £265,000, which debt, together with\r\nsuch debts as may be incurred by virtue of the 9th Article, will be a\r\nsecond charge upon the revenues of the State.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XI.\r\n\r\nThe debts due as aforesaid by the Transvaal State to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment will bear interest at the rate of three and a half per\r\ncent., and any portion of such debt which may remain unpaid at the\r\nexpiration of twelve months from the 8th August, 1881, shall be\r\nrepayable by a payment for interest and sinking fund of six pounds\r\nand nine pence per cent, per annum, which will extinguish the debt in\r\ntwenty-live years. The said payment of six pounds and nine pence per\r\n£100 shall be payable half yearly in British currency on the 8th\r\nFebruary and 8th August in each year. Provided always that the\r\nTransvaal State shall pay in reduction of the said debt the sum of\r\n£100,000 within twelve months of the 8th August, 1881, and shall be\r\nat liberty at the close of any half-year to pay off the whole or any\r\nportion of the outstanding debt.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XII.\r\n\r\nAll persons holding property in the said State on the 8th day of\r\nAugust, 1881, will continue after the said date to enjoy the rights\r\nof property which they have enjoyed since the annexation. No person\r\nwho has remained loyal to Her Majesty during the recent hostilities\r\nshall suffer any molestation by reason of his loyalty, or be liable\r\nto any criminal prosecution or civil action for any part taken in\r\nconnection with such hostilities, and all such persons will have full\r\nliberty to reside in the country, with enjoyment of all civil rights,\r\nand protection for their persons and property.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\nNatives will be allowed to acquire land, but the grant or transfer of\r\nsuch land will, in every case, be made to and registered in the name\r\nof the Native Location Commission, hereinafter mentioned, in trust\r\nfor such natives.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\nNatives will be allowed to move as freely within the country as may\r\nbe consistent with the requirements of public order, and to leave it\r\nfor the purpose of seeking employment elsewhere or for other lawful\r\npurposes, subject always to the pass laws of the said State, as\r\namended by the Legislature of the Province, or as may hereafter be\r\nenacted under the provisions of the Third Article of this Convention.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\nThere will continue to be complete freedom of religion and protection\r\nfrom molestation for all denominations, provided the same be not\r\ninconsistent with morality and good order, and no disability shall\r\nattach to any person in regard to rights of property by reason of the\r\nreligious opinions which he holds.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVI.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Fourth Article of the Sand River Convention are\r\nhereby reaffirmed, and no slavery or apprenticeship partaking of\r\nslavery will be tolerated by the Government of the said State.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVII.\r\n\r\nThe British Resident will receive from the Government of the\r\nTransvaal State such assistance and support as can by law be given to\r\nhim for the due discharge of his functions; he will also receive\r\nevery assistance for the proper care and preservation of the graves\r\nof such of Her Majesty's forces as have died in the Transvaal, and if\r\nneed be for the expropriation of land for the purpose.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe following will be the duties and functions of the British\r\nResident:\r\n\r\n_Sub-section_ 1.--He will perform duties and functions analogous to\r\nthose discharged by a Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General.\r\n\r\n_Sub-section_ 2.--In regard to natives within the Transvaal State, he\r\nwill (_a_) report to the High Commissioner, as representative of the\r\nSuzerain, as to the working and observance of the provisions of this\r\nConvention; (_b_) report to the Transvaal authorities any cases of\r\nill-treatment of natives or attempts to incite natives to rebellion\r\nthat may come to his knowledge; (_c_) use his influence with the\r\nnatives in favour of law and order; and (_d_) generally perform such\r\nother duties as are by this Convention entrusted to him, and take\r\nsuch steps for the protection of the person and property of natives\r\nas are consistent with the laws of the land.\r\n\r\n_Sub-section_ 3.--In regard to natives not residing in the Transvaal,\r\n (_a_) he will report to the High Commissioner and the Transvaal\r\nGovernment any encroachments reported to him as having been made by\r\nTransvaal residents upon the land of such natives, and in case of\r\ndisagreement between the Transvaal Government and the British\r\nResident as to whether an encroachment had been made, the decision of\r\nthe Suzerain will be final (_b_) the British Resident will be the\r\nmedium of communication with native chiefs outside the Transvaal,\r\nand, subject to the approval of the High Commissioner, as\r\nrepresenting the Suzerain, he will control the conclusion of treaties\r\nwith them; and (_c_) he will arbitrate upon every dispute between\r\nTransvaal residents and natives outside the Transvaal (us to acts\r\ncommitted beyond the boundaries of the Transvaal) which may be\r\nreferred to him by the parties interested.\r\n\r\n_Sub-section_ 4.--In regard to communications with foreign Powers,\r\nthe Transvaal Government will correspond with Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment through the British Resident and the High Commissioner.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIX.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Transvaal State will strictly adhere to the\r\nboundaries defined in the First Article of this Convention, and will\r\ndo its utmost to prevent any of its inhabitants from making any\r\nencroachment upon lands beyond the said State. The Royal Commission\r\nwill forthwith appoint a person who will beacon off the boundary line\r\nbetween Ramatlabama and the point where such line first touches\r\nGriqualand West boundary, midway between the Vaal and Hart rivers;\r\nthe person so appointed will be instructed to make an arrangement\r\nbetween the owners of the farms Grootfontein and Valleifontein on the\r\none hand, and the Barolong authorities on the other, by which a fair\r\nshare of the water supply of the said farms shall be allowed to flow\r\nundisturbed to the said Barolongs.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XX.\r\n\r\nAll grants or titles issued at any time by the Transvaal Government\r\nin respect of land outside the boundary of Transvaal State, as\r\ndefined, Article I., shall be considered invalid and of no effect,\r\nexcept in so far as any such grant or title relates to land that\r\nfalls within the boundary of the Transvaal State, and all persons\r\nholding any such grant so considered invalid and of no effect will\r\nreceive from the Government of the Transvaal State such compensation\r\neither in land or in money as the Volksraad shall determine. In all\r\ncases in which any native chiefs or other authorities outside the\r\nsaid boundaries have received any adequate consideration from the\r\nGovernment of the former South African Republic for land excluded\r\nfrom the Transvaal by the First Article of this Convention, or where\r\npermanent improvements have been made on the land, the British\r\nResident will, subject to the approval of the High Commissioner, use\r\nhis influence to recover from the native authorities fair\r\ncompensation for the loss of the land thus excluded, and of the\r\npermanent improvement thereon.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXI.\r\n\r\nForthwith, after the taking effect of this Convention, a Native\r\nLocation Commission will be constituted, consisting of the President,\r\nor in his absence the Vice-President of the State, or some one\r\ndeputed by him, the Resident, or some one deputed by him, and a third\r\nperson to be agreed upon by the President or the Vice-President, as\r\nthe case may be, and the Resident, and such Commission will be a\r\nstanding body for the performance of the duties hereinafter\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXII.\r\n\r\nThe Native Location Commission will reserve to the native tribes of\r\nthe State such locations as they may be fairly and equitably entitled\r\nto, due regard being had to the actual occupation of such tribes. The\r\nNative Location Commission will clearly define the boundaries of such\r\nlocations, and for that purpose will, in every instance, first of all\r\nascertain the wishes of the parties interested in such land. In case\r\nland already granted in individual titles shall be required for the\r\npurpose of any location, the owners will receive such compensation\r\neither in other land or in money as the Volksraad shall determine.\r\nAfter the boundaries of any location have been fixed, no fresh grant\r\nof land within such location will be made, nor will the boundaries be\r\naltered without the consent of the Location Commission. No fresh\r\ngrants of land will be made in the districts of Waterberg,\r\nZoutpansberg, and Lydenburg until the locations in the said districts\r\nrespectively shall have been defined by the said Commission.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXIII.\r\n\r\nIf not released before the taking effect of this Convention,\r\nSikukuni, and those of his followers who have been imprisoned with\r\nhim, will be forthwith released, and the boundaries of his location\r\nwill be defined by the Native Location Commission in the manner\r\nindicated in the last preceding Article.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe independence of the Swazies within the boundary line of\r\nSwaziland, as indicated in the First Article of this Convention, will\r\nbe fully recognized.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXV.\r\n\r\nNo other or higher duties will be imposed on the importation into the\r\nTransvaal State of any article the produce or manufacture of the\r\ndominions and possessions of Her Majesty, from whatever place\r\narriving, than are or may be payable on the like article the produce\r\nor manufacture of any other country, nor will any prohibition be\r\nmaintained or imposed on the importation of any article the produce\r\nor manufacture of the dominions and possessions of Her Majesty, which\r\nshall not equally extend to the importation of the like articles\r\nbeing the produce or manufacture of any other country.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXVI.\r\n\r\nAll persons other than natives conforming themselves to the laws of\r\nthe Transvaal State (_a_) will have full liberty with their families\r\nto enter, travel, or reside in any part of the Transvaal State; (_b_)\r\nthey will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactures,\r\nwarehouses, shops, and premises; (_c_) they may carry on their\r\ncommerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think to\r\nemploy; (_d_) they will not be subject in respect of their persons or\r\nproperty, or in respect of their commerce or industry to any taxes,\r\nwhether general or local, other than those which are or may be\r\nimposed upon Transvaal citizens.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXVII.\r\n\r\nAll inhabitants of the Transvaal shall have free access to the Courts\r\nof Justice for the protection and defence of their rights.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXVIII.\r\n\r\nAll persons other than natives who established their domicile in the\r\nTransvaal between the 12th day of April, 1877, and the date when this\r\nConvention comes into effect, and who shall within twelve months\r\nafter such last-mentioned date have their names registered by the\r\nBritish Resident, shall be exempt from all compulsory military\r\nservice whatever. The Resident shall notify such registration to the\r\nGovernment of the Transvaal State.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXIX.\r\n\r\nProvision shall hereafter be made by a separate instrument for the\r\nmutual extradition of criminals, and also for the surrender of\r\ndeserters from Her Majesty's forces.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXX.\r\n\r\nAll debts contracted since the annexation will be payable in the same\r\ncurrency in which they may have been contracted; all uncancelled\r\npostage and other revenue stamps issued by the Government since the\r\nannexation will remain valid, and will be accepted at their present\r\nvalue by the future Government of the State; all licenses duly issued\r\nsince the annexation will remain in force during the period for which\r\nthey may have been issued.\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXI.\r\n\r\nNo grants of land which may have been made, and no transfer of\r\nmortgage which may have been passed since the annexation, will be\r\ninvalidated by reason merely of their having been made or passed\r\nsince that date.

But I am deeply\r\ngrieved that Mr. Taljaard said what he did say. In future, I can\r\nassure you not a single member of my family shall receive a single\r\noffice. I will not even make one of them a constable.

The Raad further expressed its\r\ndisapproval of this conduct of a Christian Church, whose duty it\r\nshould be to foster Christian love, and set an example to the\r\nburghers.\r\n\r\nFIRST RAAD.\r\n\r\n_August 2_.--A memorial was read from Lichtenburg, praying for a\r\nstringent investigation into the Report of the Estimates Committee of\r\n1890, in which it was stated that of £140,000 spent on the Pretoria\r\nstreets, vouchers for £22,000 were missing. The Raad decided on the\r\nPresident's stating that nothing was wrong with the accounts to send\r\nthe memorialists a copy of the resolution of last year.\r\n\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n_July 17_.--The PRESIDENT said it was simply murdering the erection\r\nof factories to say there should be no concessions. He denied that\r\nfactories could be erected without concessions. If the Raad wished to\r\nthrow out all concessions, well and good. That simply meant the\r\nfostering of industries in other countries.\r\n\r\nSTANDS SCANDAL.{54}\r\n\r\n_August 3_.--The PRESIDENT said that speculation, when fairly\r\nconducted, was justifiable, and the Government had acted according to\r\nthe circumstances, and in the interests of the State. The Government\r\nhad no private interests in view, but thought the sale was quite\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Mines was then attacked for granting stands to Raad\r\nofficials when higher offers had been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote for Appendix C\r\n\r\n{54} By this name is known the series of transactions in which\r\nGovernment land in Johannesburg was sold out of hand to certain\r\nprivate individuals at a nominal figure, many thousands of pounds\r\nbelow the then market value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nVOLKSRAAD DEBATES.\r\n\r\n_Extracts from the Published Reports._\r\n\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n_May 8_.--On the application of the Sheba G. M. Co. for permission to\r\nerect an aërial tram from the mine to the mill,\r\n\r\nMr. GROBLAAR asked whether an aërial tram was a balloon or whether it\r\ncould fly through the air.\r\n\r\nThe only objection that the Chairman had to urge against granting the\r\ntram was that the Company had an English name, and that with so many\r\nDutch ones available.\r\n\r\nMr. TALJAARD objected to the word 'participeeren' (participate) as\r\nnot being Dutch, and to him unintelligible: 'I can't believe the word\r\nis Dutch; why have I never come across it in the Bible if it is?'\r\n\r\n_June 18_.--On the application for a concession to treat tailings,\r\n\r\nMr. TALJAARD wished to know if the words 'pyrites' and 'concentrates'\r\ncould not be translated into the Dutch language. He could not\r\nunderstand what it meant. He had gone to night-school as long as he\r\nhad been in Pretoria, and even now he could not explain everything to\r\nhis burghers. He thought it a shame that big hills should be made on\r\nground under which there might be rich reefs, and which in future\r\nmight be required for a market or outspan. He would support the\r\nrecommendation on condition that the name of the quartz should be\r\ntranslated into Dutch, as there might be more in this than some of\r\nthem imagined.\r\n\r\nREDUCTION OF IMPORT DUTIES ON EATABLES.\r\n\r\n_June 20_.--Mr. WOLMARANS said the diggers simply did not want to buy\r\nfrom the Boers; there was plenty of meat and bread in the land, and\r\nthe Boers could not get good prices for their cattle.\r\n\r\nMr. VAN HEERDEN could not see how the inhabitants of the State would\r\nbenefit in the least by lowering the tariff.\r\n\r\nMessrs. LOMBAARD and WOLMARANS both declared that when duties were at\r\ntheir highest groceries etc. were at their cheapest.\r\n\r\nMr. TALJAARD thought that members who were in favour of lowering the\r\ntariff did not act for the benefit of the country.\r\n\r\n1890.\r\n\r\n_May 29_.--A discussion of considerable length took place on a\r\npetition from burghers of Gatsrand, Potchefstroom district, praying\r\nthat at least two-thirds of the Government money now lying idle in\r\nthe banks should be given out to agriculturists as loans, and the\r\nremainder for other purposes.\r\n\r\n_July 2_.--His Honour was asked why he did not suppress all\r\nsweepstakes and races.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT said gambling and lotteries were in conflict with the\r\nWord of God, but it was also the duty of man to have exercise and to\r\nexercise his horses. For that reason an exception had been made in\r\nthe Bill as to horse-races, etc.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF OFFICIALS' SALARIES.\r\n\r\n_July 7_.--The PRESIDENT supported the increase. He promised the\r\nRaad--and he had done this before--that whenever there was a falling\r\noff in the revenue, he would at once reduce the salaries. He had said\r\nthis before, and if members did not believe him let them call him a\r\nliar at once.\r\n\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nSECOND RAAD.\r\n\r\n_June 5_.--Mr. ESSELEN objected to minutes not being full enough.\r\n\r\nMr. TALJAARD accused Mr. Esselen of insulting the Raad.\r\n\r\nA discussion ensued on minutes, in which certain proposals which had\r\nbeen rejected had not been incorporated. Several members said that\r\nthe incorporation of proposals that had been rejected would entail\r\nsome members being held up to the scorn of the public.\r\n\r\nESTIMATES.\r\n\r\n_June 24_.--Two hundred vouchers were found to be missing from the\r\nyearly accounts, and no explanation could be given. Also £13,000 had\r\nbeen given on loan to the Boeren Winkel (Boer General Store--a\r\nprivate mercantile venture).\r\n\r\n_July 27_.--Mr. MARE maintained that the Public Works were badly\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT dashed down the papers in front of him and stalked out\r\nof the Raad, after emphatically denying that money had been wasted.\r\n\r\n_July 27_.--At the debate on the question of appointing a State\r\nfinancier, who could among other things be held responsible for the\r\ndisappearance of vouchers, the Auditor-General said that he did not\r\nwant an official of that nature, who would be always snivelling about\r\nhis books.\r\n\r\nCLAUSE TWENTY-THREE OF THE GOLD LAW.\r\n\r\n_August 5_.--The PRESIDENT said that owners of properties had quite\r\nsufficient privileges already, and he did not want to give them more.\r\n\r\nMr. LOMBAARD said the Gold Fields wanted too much. The revenue from\r\nthe Gold Fields was already less than the expenditure. He was of\r\nopinion that the best course would be to let the Gold Fields go to\r\nthe devil and look after themselves.\r\n\r\n1892\r\n\r\nSECOND RAAD.\r\n\r\n_May 6._--Protracted discussion arose on the Postal Report, the\r\nConservatives being opposed to erecting pillar-boxes in Pretoria on\r\nthe ground that they were extravagant and effeminate.\r\n\r\nOOM DYLE (Mr. TALJAARD) said that he could not see why people wanted\r\nto be always writing letters. He wrote none himself. In the days of\r\nhis youth he had written a letter, and had not been afraid to travel\r\nfifty miles and more on horseback and by wagon to post it; and now\r\npeople complained if they had to go one mile.\r\n\r\nFIRST RAAD.\r\n\r\n_May 21_.--On the question of abolishing the post of Minute-Keeper to\r\nthe Executive the President fell into a passion with Mr. Loveday who\r\nthought a Minute-Keeper unnecessary, and left the Raad in a temper.\r\n\r\n_June 13_.--The PRESIDENT said the reason why he did not subsidize\r\nsome papers by giving them advertisements was that they did not\r\ndefend the Government. It was the rule everywhere to give\r\nadvertisements to papers which supported the Government.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT AND GENERAL.\r\n\r\n_July 21_.--General JOUBERT tenders his resignation as Chairman of\r\nthe Chicago Exhibition Committee. He had written again and again to\r\nthe President and State Secretary for an intimation of the\r\nGovernment's intention with regard to the amount on the Estimates,\r\nbut his communications were treated with silent contempt.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT made a long speech, in which he said he felt great\r\ngrief at being thus falsely charged by the General, who was also a\r\nmember of the Executive. Still he would only bless those who\r\nspitefully used him and would not blacken the General.\r\n\r\nSECOND RAAD.\r\n\r\n_July 21_.--After the resolution had been taken on Mr. Van Niekerk's\r\nproposition regarding compensation for claims not yet worked out\r\n(Clause 60 of Gold Law), the PRESIDENT was still speaking, and\r\nobjecting to the recording of Van Niekerk's objection to the passing\r\nof the Gold Law Clause Amendment, when Mr. ESSELEN called 'Order,\r\nOrder!' several times.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT said he was insulted by Mr. Esselen and would withdraw\r\nunless he apologized.\r\n\r\nThe Raad adjourned, as Mr. Esselen refused.\r\n\r\nFIRST RAAD.\r\n\r\nLOCUST EXTERMINATION.\r\n\r\n_July 21_.--Mr. Roos said locusts were a plague, as in the days of\r\nKing Pharaoh, sent by God, and the country would assuredly be loaded\r\nwith shame and obloquy if it tried to raise its hand against the\r\nmighty hand of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nMessrs. DECLERQ and STEENKAMP spoke in the same strain, quoting\r\nlargely from the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN related a true story of a man whose farm was always\r\nspared by the locusts, until one day he caused some to be killed. His\r\nfarm was then devastated.\r\n\r\nMr. STOOP conjured the members not to constitute themselves\r\nterrestrial gods and oppose the Almighty.\r\n\r\nMr. LUCAS MEYER raised a storm by ridiculing the arguments of the\r\nformer speakers, and comparing the locusts to beasts of prey which\r\nthey destroyed.\r\n\r\nMr. LABUSCHAGNE was violent. He said the locusts were quite different\r\nfrom beasts of prey. They were a special plague sent by God for their\r\nsinfulness.\r\n\r\n_July 26_.--Mr. DE BEER attacking the railways said they were already\r\nbeginning to eat the bitter fruits of them. He was thinking of\r\ntrekking to Damaraland, and his children would trek still further\r\ninto the wilderness out of the reach of the iron horse.\r\n\r\n_August 16_.--Mr. DE BEER said he saw where all the opposition to\r\nduties came from. It was English blood boiling to protect English\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n_June 21_.--A memorial was read from certain burghers of Waterberg\r\nabout children beating their parents, and praying that such children\r\nshould not be allowed to become officials of the State or sit in\r\nVolksraad!\r\n\r\nMr. DE BEER--the Member for Waterberg--who in the days of his hot\r\nyouth is said to have given his father a sound thrashing, and is the\r\none aimed at by the memorialists, denied all knowledge of the\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nCHARLESTOWN EXTENSION.\r\n\r\n_August 24_.--Mr. WOLMARANS opposed the line, as it would compete\r\nwith the Delagoa Bay Railway, for which the State was responsible.\r\n\r\nMr. LE CLERQ maintained that the Cape Free State line was against the\r\ninterests of the burghers, as a tremendous number of cattle were\r\nbrought into the State from outside countries.\r\n\r\nMr. MALAN said he would never vote for this line.\r\n\r\nMr. ROOS referred to the sacred voice of the people, which he said\r\nwas against railways.\r\n\r\nThe extension was eventually approved of.\r\n\r\n1894.\r\n\r\nFIRST RAAD.\r\n\r\n_May 14_.--A debate took place upon the clause that members should\r\nappear in the House clad in broadcloth and having white neckties.\r\n\r\nMr. JAN DE BEER complained of the lack of uniformity in neckties.\r\nSome wore a Tom Thumb variety, and others wore scarves. This was a\r\nstate of things to be deplored, and he considered that the Raad\r\nshould put its foot down and define the size and shape of neckties.\r\n\r\nJAM CONCESSION.\r\n\r\n_August 28_.--The PRESIDENT said he was against concessions generally\r\nspeaking, but there were cases where exceptions should be made. There\r\nwas for instance the Jam Concession. The manufacture of jam ought to\r\nbe protected.\r\n\r\nREDUCTION OF POSTAGE FROM TWOPENCE TO ONE PENNY THROUGHOUT THE\r\nREPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n_August 22_.--Mr. WOLMARANS opposed the reduction, saying the Postal\r\nDepartment would probably show a deficit at the end of the year. And\r\nbesides who would benefit? Certainly not the farmers.\r\n\r\nMr. LOMBAARD also was against the reduction.\r\n\r\nMr. DE LA REY said speculators could afford to pay the present rates\r\nof postage, and as the reduction would only benefit the townspeople,\r\nlet matters remain unaltered. If he resided in a town and speculated\r\nhe would be able to pay twopence.\r\n\r\nMr. SCHUTTE said the Postal Department was run at a loss at present,\r\nand if they further reduced the tariff things would go very badly\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nReduction rejected, 13 to 9.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF REPRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n_September 6_.--The PRESIDENT throughout the debate maintained that\r\nthere was no advantage to be gained by increased representation, and\r\nthat business could be more quickly transacted with a small number of\r\nmembers. He disagreed with those members who wished to give big towns\r\nrepresentatives as the Raad would be swamped with town members.\r\n\r\nAfter the rejection of various proposals the PRESIDENT rose and\r\npointed out it would mean ruination to the country if the Raad\r\nresolved to increase the number of the members, and amidst some\r\nconfusion he left, declining to occupy the Presidential chair,\r\nmuttering that the Raad was large enough already and if it were\r\nincreased it would be a shame.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION QUESTION.\r\n\r\n_September 7_.--The Committee reported that a number of memorials had\r\nbeen received, praying that more hours weekly should be devoted to\r\nthe English language. Counter memorials had also been received. The\r\nCommittee advised the Raad not to grant the request of more hours for\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nMr. LOMBAARD thought the Raad was bound to refuse the request, and it\r\nwould be useless to discuss the matter.\r\n\r\nMr. DE BEER could see no harm in granting the request, in fact it was\r\ntheir duty to do so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPIES considered there was no necessity to teach English in the\r\nState. Trade did not require it, and they could get on very well\r\nwithout English. Let the English remain in their own country.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT was opposed to extending the hours. He did not object\r\nto English being taught, but then it must not interfere with the\r\nlanguage of the country to the prejudice of the latter language. He\r\nhad schools upon his farm, and parents objected to their children\r\nbeing taught English in those schools. After a very little while they\r\ncould write English as well as or better than their own language, and\r\nneglected Dutch for English. _The Dutch language could not be\r\nmaintained against English in competition._\r\n\r\nMr. WOLMARANS also spoke against the English language saying that if\r\nthey went through the list of those who had signed the memorial for\r\nthe annexation of the Transvaal by the English, they would find\r\nwithout exception that those who signed were English-speaking.\r\nHe was against children being taught English so early, as when they\r\nwere taught young their minds became poisoned with English views.\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO agreed with the spirit of the Committee's report. This was a\r\nDutch country, with Dutch laws, and why should they be asked to\r\nexchange the Dutch language for the English? What had the English\r\ndone for the country that this should be asked?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN thought many members made too much of the English\r\nlanguage already. One language was sufficient, and if a man was\r\nproperly educated in his own tongue that should suffice.\r\n\r\nMr. LE CLERQ and Mr. PRINSLOO both cautioned the Raad against foreign\r\nlanguages in their schools.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEDAY pointed out the absurdity of saying that the National\r\nIndependence depended upon one language only being used, and pointed\r\nto the American and Swiss Republics as examples.\r\n\r\nMr. LOMBAARD in the course of a violent speech said those people who\r\nwanted English taught in the State-aided schools were aiming at the\r\nindependence of the State. They wanted to bring dissension in the\r\nmidst of the burghers by teaching new and wrong ideas, and they\r\nbecame indignant because the burghers would not allow it. He was\r\nashamed that members should argue in favour of injuring their\r\nindependence: English should not be taught in the State-aided\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe law remained unaltered by 12 to 10.\r\n\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n_July 26_.--The matter of purchasing diamond drills cropping up, the\r\nPRESIDENT said it was true that the two industries mining and\r\nagriculture went hand in hand, but it must be remembered that every\r\nfresh goldfield opened meant a fresh stream of people and extra\r\nexpenses. He hoped the Raad would excuse him referring to it, but the\r\nRaad took away the revenue and still asked for money. There was the\r\nreduction of postage; now it was asked to spend money on boring\r\nmachines, when each new field meant so much extra expense. Machines\r\nfor water boring were cheap and not fitted with diamonds like those\r\nfor mining, which required to be handled by experts. It must be\r\nremembered that money voted for agricultural purposes was spent here,\r\nwhile for the gold industry it was sent away. The Raad must be\r\ncareful how the money was voted.\r\n\r\nFIRST RAAD.\r\n\r\nFIRING AT THE CLOUDS TO BRING DOWN RAIN CONSIDERED IMPIOUS.\r\n\r\n_August 5_.--A memorial was read from Krugersdorp praying that the\r\nRaad would pass a law to prohibit the sending up of bombs into the\r\nclouds to bring down rain, as it was a defiance of God and would most\r\nlikely bring down a visitation from the Almighty.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial Committee reported that they disapproved of such a\r\nthing, but at the same time they did not consider they could make a\r\nlaw on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. A.D. WOLMARANS said he was astonished at this advice, and he\r\nexpected better from the Commission. If one of their children fired\r\ntowards the clouds with a revolver they would thrash him. Why should\r\nthey permit people to mock at the Almighty in this manner? It was\r\nterrible to contemplate. He hoped that the Raad would take steps to\r\nprevent such things happening.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN (who is also a member of the Memorial Commission) said\r\nthe Commission thought that such things were only done for a wager.\r\n\r\nMr. ERASMUS said they were not done for a wager but in real earnest.\r\nPeople at Johannesburg actually thought that they could bring down\r\nthe rain from the clouds by firing cannons at them.\r\n\r\nMr. JAN MEYER said such things were actually done in Johannesburg.\r\nLast year during the drought men were engaged to send charges of\r\ndynamite into the clouds. They fired from the Wanderers' Ground and\r\nfrom elsewhere, but without result. Then some one went to Germiston\r\nand fired at a passing cloud; but there was no rain. The cloud sailed\r\naway, and the heavens became clear and beautifully blue. He had\r\nreported the matter to the Government.\r\n\r\nMr. DU TOIT (Carolina) said he had heard that there were companies in\r\nEurope which employed numbers of men to do nothing but shoot at the\r\nclouds simply to bring down rain. It was wonderful that men could\r\nthink of doing such things; they ought to be prohibited here. He did\r\nnot consider that the Raad would be justified in passing a law on the\r\nsubject, however; but he thought all the same that they should\r\nexpress their strongest disapproval of such practices.\r\n\r\nMr. BIRKENSTOCK ridiculed the idea of people forcing rain from the\r\nclouds. In some of the Kaffir countries they had witch-doctors who\r\ntried to bring down rain; whether they succeeded or not was a\r\ndifferent matter. Still, if people were foolish enough to try and\r\nforce the clouds to discharge rain, the Legislature ought not to\r\ninterfere to prevent them. He did not agree with the idea of firing\r\nat the clouds, but did not consider that an Act should be passed to\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN said if such things were actually done--and he was\r\nunaware of it--those who did it ought to be prevented from repeating\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter a further discussion, Mr. A.D. WOLMARANS moved: 'That this\r\nRaad, considering the memorial now on the Order, resolves to agree\r\nwith the same, and instructs the Government to take the necessary\r\nsteps to prevent a repetition of the occurrences referred to.'\r\n\r\nSECOND RAAD.\r\n\r\nBARMAIDS.\r\n\r\nThe article for the abolition of barmaids was dealt with.\r\n\r\nMr. WATKINS declared himself strongly against such an article. He\r\ncould not see why females should be prevented from dispensing liquor.\r\nSuch a clause would prevent many respectable young women from making\r\na living.\r\n\r\nMr. PRETORIUS said there were many memorials on this subject, and in\r\ncompliance with the wish expressed therein the article was inserted\r\nin the Liquor Law. Of course, it was for the Raad to decide.\r\n\r\nMr. RENSBURG spoke strongly against the clause. According to it the\r\nproprietor's wife would be prevented from going behind the counter.\r\nHe would not deny that there were some barmaids who were not strictly\r\nvirtuous, but to accuse them as a class of being dangerous was\r\ngoing too far. Many of the memorials were signed by women. These\r\nmemorials were drawn by men whom he considered were hypocrites, and\r\nthey ought to be ashamed of themselves for their narrow-mindedness.\r\n\r\nMr. VAN STADEN said he did not like to take the bread out of the\r\nmouths of a great many women.\r\n\r\nMr. KOENIG suggested that they could become chambermaids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\nMALABOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 4_.--An Executive resolution was read, stating that the\r\nExecutive had decided to deprive Malaboch of his rights of\r\nchieftainship, and keep him in the custody of the Government, and\r\nthat his tribe be broken up and apprenticed out to burghers, each\r\nburgher applying to have one or two families upon payment of £3 per\r\nfamily per annum. The Executive wished the Raad to approve of this;\r\nthe Government had the right to do this according to law. This was\r\nwithout prejudice to the trial before the High Court. Perhaps when\r\nthe Krijgsraad assembled it would be decided to try him before the\r\nHigh Court on charges of murder and rebellion.\r\n\r\nMr. JEPPE thought this was a matter for the High Court, and\r\ncounselled the Raad to adopt that course, giving the chief a public\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT said the Executive acted strictly in accordance with\r\nthe law; it was not necessary for the Government to send the case to\r\nthe High Court, as it had the power to decide native cases. For\r\ninstance, in the case of Lo Bengula and his headmen, they were not\r\ntried by any High Court.\r\n\r\nMr. MEYER thought they should give Malaboch a fair trial.\r\n\r\nFinally Mr. MEYER moved, and Mr. JEPPE seconded, that Executive\r\nresolution be accepted for notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FRANCHISE DEBATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract is made from the Report of the great Franchise\r\nDebate, published in the Johannesburg _Star_, August 17, 1895:\r\n\r\nEXTENSION OF THE FRANCHISE.--MONSTER UITLANDER PETITIONS.--WHAT THE\r\nBURGHERS WISH.\r\n\r\nPetitions were read praying for the extension of the franchise. The\r\npetitioners pointed out that they were all residents in the Republic,\r\nthat the increase of the wealth of the country and the status of the\r\ncountry were due to their energy and wealth, that the number of the\r\nnon-enfranchised far exceeded the number of the burghers, that\r\ntaxation was so arranged that the non-enfranchised bore four-fifths\r\nof the taxes. The memorialists pointed out that one of the Republican\r\nprinciples was equality, but that notwithstanding the numerously\r\nsigned memorials the Raad decided last year to make the Franchise Law\r\nso stringent that a new-comer could never obtain the franchise, and\r\nhis children could only obtain it under severe conditions. They\r\npointed out the danger of this, and prayed for admission under\r\nreasonable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe petitions came from every part of the country, including all the\r\nBoer strongholds, and some were signed by influential officials. One\r\npetition from Johannesburg was signed by 32,479 persons, and the\r\ntotal signatures amounted to 35,483.\r\n\r\nMemorials to the same effect were read from a large number of farming\r\ndistricts, signed by 993 full burghers, who were anxious that the\r\nfranchise should be extended to law-abiding citizens. These memorials\r\ncontained the names of prominent farmers. There were nineteen of\r\nthese last-named memorials, four of which came from different parts\r\nof the Pretoria district and three from Potchefstroom.\r\n\r\nA memorial was read from Lydenburg, suggesting that ten years'\r\nresidence in the country and obedience to the law be the\r\nqualification. This was signed by about a hundred burghers.\r\n\r\nA number of memorials were read from Rustenberg, Waterberg, Piet\r\nRetief, Utrecht, Middelberg, Zoutpansberg, and Krugersdorp, signed by\r\nabout 500 burghers, stating that while they valued the friendship of\r\nthe peace-abiding Uitlanders they petitioned the Raad not to extend\r\nthe franchise or alter last year's law.\r\n\r\nA memorial from Krugersdorp was to the effect that the franchise\r\nshould not be extended until absolutely necessary, and then only in\r\nterms of Art. 4 of the Franchise Law of 1894. This was signed by\r\nthirteen persons.\r\n\r\nOne was read from the Apies River and Standerton, praying that the\r\nchildren of Uitlanders born here should not be granted the franchise.\r\n\r\nMemorials from other places, with 523 signatures, prayed that the\r\nexisting Franchise Law should be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nSeveral petitions against the prohibition of the Election Committee\r\nwere read.\r\n\r\nA further memorial from the Rand was read, containing 5,152\r\nsignatures, pointing out that they objected to the memorial issued by\r\nthe National Union, and they wanted the system of one-man-one-vote\r\nand the ballot system adopted before they asked for the franchise.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial Committee recommended that the law remain unaltered,\r\nbecause the memorials signed by full burghers requested no extension\r\nto take place.\r\n\r\nMr. LUCAS MEYER, who was chairman of the Memorial Commission,\r\nsubmitted a report, stating that he was in the minority and differed\r\nfrom his fellow-committeemen. There was not a single member of the\r\nRaad who would use his powers more towards maintaining the\r\nindependence of the country than himself, but he was fully convinced\r\nthat the Raad had as bounden duty to propose an alteration to last\r\nyear's law. Proposals to do so had to emanate from the Raad. A large\r\nmajority of memorialists who prayed for the extension were not\r\nburghers, but even those burghers who petitioned the Raad against the\r\nextension asked the Raad not to do so at present. That showed that\r\nthey were convinced that sooner or later the extension would have to\r\ntake place--cautiously perhaps, but the extension would come. Even\r\nthe committee, the majority of whom were against him, recognised\r\nthis. He repeated that it was his opinion that the time would come.\r\nLet the Raad then submit the proposal to the country, and if the\r\nmajority of the burghers were against it, the Raad would have to\r\nstand or fall with the burghers; but at any rate they would be acting\r\naccording to the will of the country, and could not be blamed for\r\npossible consequences. Recently the President said something had to\r\nbe done to admit a portion of the people who were behind the dam,\r\nbefore the stream became so strong that the walls would be washed\r\naway and the country immersed in water. He hoped the Raad would\r\nfavourably consider his proposal.\r\n\r\nMr. TOSEN said that when the proposals came to extend the franchise,\r\nsuch proposals had to come from old burghers, and so far the old\r\nburghers had not signified their willingness that this should be\r\ndone. On the contrary, a large number of them were against it. They\r\ndid not wish to exclude the new-comers for all eternity, but just now\r\nthey should make no concession. It stood to reason that the\r\nnew-comers could not have so much interest in the country as the old\r\ninhabitants. He cautioned the Raad against accepting the\r\nrecommendations of Mr. Meyer. _It would be contrary to Republican\r\nprinciples_. Yes, he repeated it would be contrary to the principles\r\nof Republicanism, and were newcomers admitted to the franchise the\r\nold burghers would be deprived of all their rights. They would not\r\ndare to vote or exercise any of their privileges. Those persons who\r\nsigned the petition for the franchise said they were peaceful and\r\nlaw-abiding citizens, _but they gave a sign that they were not\r\nlaw-abiding, because they were against the law. The Election Law was\r\nthere, and they should abide by it._\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN called the speaker to order and advised him to keep to\r\nthe point, whether it was desirable to extend the franchise or not.\r\n\r\nMr. TOSEN said he was cut short, but in a few words he would say that\r\nhe would resist to the bitter end any attempt to alter the law as it\r\nat present stood. He spoke on behalf of his constituents and himself.\r\n\r\nMr. JEPPE, in the course of his speech, said: Who are the people who\r\nnow demand from us a reasonable extension of the franchise? There are\r\nto begin with almost a thousand old burghers who consent to such\r\nextension. There are in addition 890 petitioners, also old burghers,\r\nwho complain that the franchise has been narrowed by recent\r\nlegislation. There are 5,100, chiefly from the Rand, who ask for\r\nextension subject to the ballot, the principle of which has already\r\nbeen adopted by you, and there is lastly a monster petition, bearing\r\n35,700 names, chiefly from the Rand goldfields: and in passing I may\r\nmention that I have convinced myself that the signatures to it, with\r\nvery few exceptions perhaps are undoubtedly genuine. Well, this\r\npetition has been practically signed by the entire population of the\r\nRand. There are not three hundred people of any standing whose names\r\ndo not appear there. It contains the name of the millionaire\r\ncapitalist on the same page as that of the carrier or miner, that of\r\nthe owner of half a district next to that of a clerk, and the\r\nsignature of the merchant who possesses stores in more than one town\r\nof this Republic next to that of the official. It embraces also all\r\nnationalities: the German merchant, the doctor from Capetown, the\r\nEnglish director, the teacher from the Paarl--they all have signed\r\nit. So have--and that is significant--old burghers from the Free\r\nState, whose fathers with yours reclaimed this country; and it bears\r\ntoo the signatures of some who have been born in this country, who\r\nknow no other fatherland than this Republic, but whom the law regards\r\nas strangers. Then too there are the newcomers. They have settled for\r\ngood: they have built Johannesburg, one of the wonders of the age,\r\nnow valued at many millions sterling, and which, in a few short\r\nyears, will contain from a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand\r\nsouls; they own half the soil, they pay at least three-quarters of\r\nthe taxes. Nor are they persons who belong to a subservient race.\r\nThey come from countries where they freely exercised political rights\r\nwhich can never be long denied to free-born men. They are, in short,\r\nmen who in capital, energy and education are at least our equals. All\r\nthese persons are gathered together, thanks to our law, into one\r\ncamp. Through our own act this multitude, which contains elements\r\nwhich even the most suspicious amongst us would not hesitate to\r\ntrust, is compelled to stand together, and so to stand in this most\r\nfatal of all questions in antagonism to us. Is that fact alone not\r\nsufficient to warn us and to prove how unstatesmanlike our policy is?\r\nWhat will we do with them now? Shall we convert them into friends or\r\nshall we send them away empty, dissatisfied, embittered? What will\r\nour answer be? Dare we refer them to the present law, which first\r\nexpects them to wait for fourteen years and even then pledges itself\r\nto nothing, but leaves everything to a Volksraad which cannot decide\r\nuntil 1905? It is a law which denies all political rights even to\r\ntheir children born in this country. Can they gather any hope from\r\nthat? Is not the fate of the petition of Mr. Justice Morice, whose\r\nrequest, however reasonable, could not be granted except by the\r\nalteration of the law published for twelve months and consented to by\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire burgher population, a convincing proof how\r\nuntenable is the position which we have assumed? Well, should we\r\nresolve now to refuse this request, what will we do when as we well\r\nknow must happen it is repeated by two hundred thousand one day. You\r\nwill all admit the doors must be opened. What will become of us or\r\nour children on that day, when we shall find ourselves in a minority\r\nof perhaps one in twenty, without a single friend amongst the other\r\nnineteen, amongst those who will then tell us they wished to be\r\nbrothers, but that we by our own act made them strangers to the\r\nRepublic? Old as the world is, has an attempt like ours ever\r\nsucceeded for long? Shall we say as a French king did that things\r\nwill last our time, and after that we reck not the deluge? Again I\r\nask what account is to be given to our descendants and what can be\r\nour hope in the future?\r\n\r\nMr. DE CLERCQ opposed the extension.\r\n\r\nMr. JAN DE BEER said he could not agree to the prayer for extension.\r\nThe burghers would decide time enough when the dam was too full, or\r\nwhen fresh water was wanted. He had gone through the memorials, and\r\nsome that wished an extension were unknown to him, even those who\r\nsigned from his district. Very few persons were in favour of the\r\nextension. If the burghers wished it he would give it, he would agree\r\nto it. The people coolly asked the Raad to extend the franchise to\r\n80,000 persons, men who were not naturalized and had nothing to lose.\r\nHe did not mind extending the franchise to a few. When it was a small\r\ncase he did not object, but when it came to giving away their\r\nbirthright wholesale he kicked. He did not object to give the burgher\r\nright to _persons who shot Kaffirs_, or he had better say, persons\r\nwho went into the native wars on behalf of the Transvaal, because\r\nthey shed their blood for the country; but people who came here only\r\nto make money and that only did not deserve the franchise. Let them\r\nlook at that book of signatures on the table with the 70,000 names.\r\nWho were they? (Laughter, and cries of 'Too much.') Well, 38,000\r\nthen. He had 'too much.' They were the persons, the millionaires side\r\nby side with mining workers whom Mr. Jeppe spoke of, but where did\r\nthey find these people side by side? Nowhere! No, he would not grant\r\nan extension of the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT said he wished to say a few words on the subject, and\r\nthe first thing he had to say was that those persons who signed the\r\nmonster petition were unfaithful and not law-abiding.\r\n\r\nMr. JEPPE: I deny that.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT: Yes--I repeat unfaithful.\r\n\r\nMr. JEPPE (excitedly): I say they are not!\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN: Order, order!\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT then endeavoured to qualify his remarks by reasserting\r\nthat these people were disrespectful and disobedient to the law,\r\nbecause they were not naturalized. 'Now,' asked His Honour\r\ntriumphantly, 'can you contradict that? No, you cannot. No one can.\r\nThe law says that they must be naturalized, and they are not.'\r\nSpeeches had been made that afternoon, His Honour proceeded, urging\r\nthat the rich should be made burghers and not the poor. Why not the\r\npoor as well as the rich, if that were the case? But he was against\r\ngranting any extension, saving in cases like that he mentioned the\r\nother day. Those who went on commando were entitled to it, but no\r\nothers. Those persons who showed they loved the country by making\r\nsuch sacrifices were entitled to the franchise, and they should get\r\nit. These memorials were being sent in year by year, and yearly\r\nthreats were made to them if they did not open the flood-gates. If\r\nthe dam was full before the walls were washed over, a certain portion\r\nof the water had to be drained off. Well, this had been done in\r\nthe case of commando men. They were the clean water which was drained\r\noff and taken into the inner dam which consisted of clean water, but\r\nhe did not wish to take in the dirty water also. No, it had to remain\r\nin the outer dam until it was cleaned and purified. The Raad might\r\njust as well give away the independence of the country as give all\r\nthese new-comers, these disobedient persons, the franchise. These\r\npersons knew there was a law, but they wished to evade it; they\r\nwished to climb the wall instead of going along the road quietly, and\r\nthese persons should be kept back. He earnestly cautioned the Raad\r\nagainst adopting Mr. L. Meyer's proposal.\r\n\r\nMr. D. JOUBERT said excitement would not avail them. They had to be\r\ncalm and deliberate. Now, what struck him was first who would give\r\nthem the assurance, were they to admit the 35,000 persons who\r\npetitioned them for the franchise, that they would maintain the\r\nindependence of the country inviolate and as a sacred heritage? They\r\nhad no guarantee. He could not agree with the request of the petition\r\n(here the speaker became excited, and gesticulating violently,\r\ncontinued), and he would never grant the request if the decision was\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\nMr. A.J. WOLMARANS said that his position on this question was that\r\nhe would not budge an inch.\r\n\r\nMr. JAN MEYER impugned the genuineness of the petition, and said he\r\nhad represented Johannesburg in the Raad for some time, and could\r\ntell them how those things were worked. They were nearly all\r\nforgeries. He stated that as there were only 40,000 people in\r\nJohannesburg it was impossible that 38,000 of them signed. Therefore\r\nthey were forgeries. The speaker concluded by saying that as long as\r\nhe lived he would never risk the independence of the country by\r\ngranting the franchise, _except in accordance with the law_. It was\r\nunreasonable to ask him to give up his precious birthright in this\r\nthoughtless manner. He could not do it--he would not do it!\r\n\r\nMr. PRINSLOO said that he had gone through the petitions from\r\nPotchefstroom, and certainly he had to admit that many of the\r\nsignatures were not genuine, for he found on these petitions the\r\nnames of his next-door neighbours, who had never told him a word\r\nabout their signing such petitions.\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO again addressed the Raad, endeavouring to prove that\r\nmemorials from Ottos Hoop contained many forgeries. He said that he\r\ndid not consider the Johannesburg people who signed in that wonderful\r\nand fat book on the table to be law-abiding, and he would have none\r\nof them. The Raad had frequently heard that if the franchise were not\r\nextended there would be trouble. He was tired of these constant\r\nthreats. He would say, 'Come on and fight! Come on!' (Cries of\r\n'Order!')\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO (proceeding): I say, 'Come on and have it out; and the\r\nsooner the better.' I cannot help it, Mr. Chairman, I must speak out.\r\nI say I am prepared to fight them, and I think every burgher of the\r\nSouth African Republic is with me.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN (rapping violently): Order, order!\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO: Yes, this poor South African Republic, which they say they\r\nown three-fourths of. They took it from us, and we fought for it and\r\ngot it back.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN: Order!\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO: They called us rebels then. I say they are rebels.\r\n\r\nLoud cries of 'Order!'\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO: I will say to-day, those persons who signed the memorials\r\nin that book are rebels.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN: Will you keep order? You have no right to say such\r\nthings. We are not considering the question of powers, but the\r\npeaceful question of the extension of the franchise to-day; and keep\r\nto the point.\r\n\r\nMr. OTTO: Very well I will; but I call the whole country to witness\r\nthat you silenced me, and would not allow me to speak out my mind.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT said they had to distinguish between trustworthy\r\npersons and untrustworthy, and one proof was their going on commando,\r\nand the other was their becoming naturalized. People who were\r\nnaturalized were more or less worthy, and if they separated\r\nthemselves from the others who would not get naturalized, and\r\npetitioned the Raad themselves, the Raad would give ear to their\r\npetition. He strongly disapproved of the Raad being deceived in the\r\nmanner it had been by the forged signatures.\r\n\r\nMr. R.K. LOVEDAY, in the course of an address dealing exhaustively\r\nwith the subject, said: The President uses the argument that they\r\nshould naturalize, and thus give evidence of their desire to become\r\ncitizens. I have used the same argument, but what becomes of such\r\narguments when met with the objections that the law requires such\r\npersons to undergo a probationary period extending from fourteen to\r\ntwenty-four years before they are admitted to full rights of\r\ncitizenship, and even after one has undergone that probationary\r\nperiod, he can only be admitted to full rights by resolution of the\r\nFirst Raad? Law 4 of 1890, being the Act of the two Volksraads, lays\r\ndown clearly and distinctly that those who have been eligible for ten\r\nyears for the Second Raad _can_ be admitted to full citizenship. So\r\nthat, in any case, the naturalized citizen cannot obtain full rights\r\nuntil he reaches the age of forty years, he not being eligible for\r\nthe Second Raad until he is thirty years. The child born of\r\nnon-naturalized parents must therefore wait until he is forty\r\nyears-of age, although at the age of sixteen he may be called upon to\r\ndo military service, and may fall in the defence of the land of his\r\nbirth. When such arguments are hurled at me by our own flesh and\r\nblood--our kinsmen from all parts of South Africa--I must confess\r\nthat I am not surprised that these persons indignantly refuse to\r\naccept citizenship upon such unreasonable terms. The element I have\r\njust referred to--namely, the Africander element--is very\r\nconsiderable, and numbers thousands hundreds of whom at the time this\r\ncountry was struggling for its independence, accorded it moral and\r\nfinancial support, and yet these very persons are subjected to a term\r\nof probation extending from fourteen to twenty-four years. It is\r\nuseless for me to ask you whether such a policy is just and\r\nreasonable or Republican, for there can be but one answer, and that\r\nis 'No!' Is there one man in this Raad who would accept the franchise\r\non the same terms? Let me impress upon you the grave nature of this\r\nquestion, and the absolute necessity of going to the burghers without\r\na moment's delay, and consulting and advising them. Let us keep\r\nnothing from them regarding the true position, and I am sure we shall\r\nhave their hearty co-operation in any reasonable scheme we may\r\nsuggest. This is a duty we owe them, for we must not leave them under\r\nthe impression that the Uitlanders are satisfied to remain aliens, as\r\nstated by some of the journals. I move amongst these people, and\r\nlearn to know their true feelings, and when public journals tell you\r\nthat these people are satisfied with their lot, they tell you that\r\nwhich they know to be false. Such journals are amongst the greatest\r\nsources of danger that the country has. We are informed by certain\r\nmembers that a proposition for the extension of the franchise must\r\ncome from the burghers, but according to the Franchise Law the\r\nproposition must come from the Raad, and the public must consent. The\r\nmember for Rustenberg says that there are 9,338 burghers who have\r\ndeclared that they are opposed to the extension of the franchise.\r\nUpon reference to the Report, he will find that there are only 1,564\r\nopposed to the extension. Members appear afraid to touch upon the\r\nreal question at issue, but try to discredit the memorials by vague\r\nstatements that some of the signatures are not genuine, and the\r\nformer member for Johannesburg, Mr. J. Meyer, seems just as anxious\r\nto discredit the people of Johannesburg as formerly he was to defend\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN advanced many arguments in favour of granting the\r\nfranchise to the Uitlander, but nevertheless concluded by stating\r\nthat as the Raad with few exceptions were against the extension, he\r\nwould go with the majority. He was not, he said, averse to the\r\npublication of Mr. Meyer's proposition, because the country would\r\nhave to decide upon it; still he could not favour the extension of\r\nthe franchise in the face of what had been said during the debate.\r\nLet the Raad endeavour to lighten the burden of the alien in other\r\nrespects. Let the alien come to the Raad with his grievances, and let\r\nthe Raad give a patient ear unto him, but he really was not entitled\r\nto the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT again counselled the Raad not to consent to the\r\npublication of Mr. Meyer's proposal. He did not want it put to the\r\ncountry. This business had been repeated from year to year until he\r\nwas tired of it. And why should they worry and weary the burghers\r\nonce more by asking them to decide upon Mr. Meyer's motion? There was\r\nno need for it. There was no uncertainty about it. The burghers knew\r\ntheir minds, and their will, which was supreme, was known. The way\r\nwas open for aliens to become burghers; let them follow that road and\r\nnot try to jump over the wall. They had the privilege of voting for\r\nthe Second Raad if they became naturalized, and could vote for\r\nofficials, and that was more than they could do in the Cape Colony.\r\nIn the Colony they could not vote for a President or any official.\r\nThey were all appointed. They could only vote for Raad members there.\r\nAnd why should they want more power here all at once? What was the\r\ncause of all this commotion? What were they clamouring for? He knew.\r\nThey wanted to get leave to vote for members of the First Raad, which\r\nhad the independence of the country under its control. He had been\r\ntold by these people that 'if you take us on the same van with you,\r\nwe cannot overturn the van without hurting ourselves as well as you.'\r\n'_Ja_,' that was true, '_maar_,' the PRESIDENT continued, they could\r\npull away the reins and drive the van along a different route.\r\n\r\nMr. JEPPE, again speaking, said there was one matter he must refer\r\nto. That was his Honour's remarks about the petitioners, calling them\r\ndisobedient and unfaithful. The law compels no one to naturalize\r\nhimself. How then could these petitioners have disobeyed it? Of\r\ncourse we should prefer them to naturalize. But can we be surprised\r\nif they hesitate to do so? Mr. Loveday has told you what\r\nnaturalization means to them.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT agreed that these people were not obliged by law to\r\nnaturalize, but if they wanted burgher rights they should do so, when\r\nthey would get the franchise for the Second Raad; and upon their\r\nbeing naturalized let them come nicely to the Raad and the Raad would\r\nhave something to go to the country with, and they would receive\r\nfair treatment; but, if they refused naturalization and rejected the\r\nTransvaal laws, could they expect the franchise? No. Let Mr. Jeppe go\r\nback and give his people good advice, and if they were obedient to\r\nthe law and became naturalized they would not regret it; but he\r\ncould not expect his people to be made full burghers if they were\r\ndisobedient and refused naturalization. Let them do as he advised,\r\nand he (the President) would stand by them and support them.\r\n\r\nMr. JEPPE said: His Honour has again asked me to advise the people of\r\nJohannesburg what to do regarding the extension of the franchise. He\r\nsays they must first naturalize and then come again. Then he holds\r\nout hopes that their wishes will be met. Why then does he not support\r\nMr. Meyer's proposal, which affects naturalized people only? What\r\nis it I am to advise the people of Johannesburg? I have had many\r\nsuggestions from different members. You, Mr. Chairman, seem to\r\nsupport the hundred men from Lydenburg who suggest ten years'\r\nresidence as a qualification. Mr. Jan Meyer suggests that those who\r\ncame early to the goldfields should memorialize separately, and he\r\nwould support them. Others say that only those who are naturalized\r\nshould petition, and that if a few hundreds petitioned instead of\r\n35,000, their reception would be different. Well, we have had one\r\npetition here wherein all these conditions were complied with. It was\r\nnot signed by anyone who had not been here ten years, or who is not\r\nnaturalized, or who could at all be suspected of being unfaithful,\r\nnor could any exception be taken to it on the ground of numbers,\r\nsince it was signed by one man only, Mr. Justice Morice, and yet it\r\nwas rejected. Gentlemen, I am anxiously groping for the light; but\r\nwhat, in the face of this, am I to advise my people?\r\n\r\nMr. JAN DE BEER endeavoured to refute Messrs. Jeppe's and Loveday's\r\nstatements, when they said a man could not become a full member until\r\nhe was forty. They were out of their reckoning, because a man did not\r\nlive until he was sixteen. He was out of the country. In the eyes of\r\nthe law he was a foreigner until he was sixteen. (Laughter.) The\r\nmember adduced other similar arguments to refute those of Messrs.\r\nJeppe and Loveday, causing much laughter.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEDAY replied to the President, especially referring to his\r\nHonour's statement that he (Mr. Loveday) was wrong when he said that\r\na person would have to wait until he was forty before he could obtain\r\nthe full rights. He (Mr. Loveday) repeated and emphasized his\r\nstatements of yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN said there was no doubt about it. What Mr. Loveday said\r\nregarding the qualifications and how long a man would have to wait\r\nuntil he was qualified to become a full burgher was absolutely\r\ncorrect. It could not be contradicted. The law was clear on that\r\npoint. There was no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JAN DE BEER: Yes; I see now Mr. Loveday is right, and I am wrong.\r\nThe law does say what Mr. Loveday said. It must be altered.\r\n\r\nThe debate was closed on the third day, and Mr. Otto's motion to\r\naccept the report of the majority of the Committee, to refuse the\r\nrequest of the memoralists, and to refer them to the existing laws,\r\nwas carried by sixteen votes to eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX G.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF DR. JAMESON'S SURRENDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Hercules Robinson to Mr. Chamberlain._\r\n\r\nReceived April 6, 1896.\r\n\r\n  _Government House, Capetown,\r\n               March 16, 1896._\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to transmit for your information a copy of a\r\ndespatch from Her Majesty's Acting Agent at Pretoria, enclosing a\r\ncommunication from the Government of the South African Republic,\r\naccompanied by sworn declarations, respecting the terms of the\r\nsurrender of Dr. Jameson's force, a summary of which documents I\r\ntelegraphed to you on the 12th instant.\r\n\r\nAt my request, Lieutenant-General Goodenough has perused these sworn\r\ndeclarations, and informs me 'that,' in his opinion, 'Jameson's\r\nsurrender was unconditional, except that his and his people's lives\r\nwere to be safe so far as their immediate captors were concerned.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have, etc.,\r\n           HERCULES ROBINSON,\r\n      _Governor and High Commissioner._\r\n\r\nEnclosed in above letter.\r\n\r\n_From H.

Commandant Cronjé, substantiated by Field-Cornet Maartens and\r\nAssistant Field-Cornet Van Vuuren.\r\n\r\n2. Commandant Potgieter.\r\n\r\n3. Commandant Malan.\r\n\r\n4. J.S. Colliers, substantiated by B.J. Viljoen, and the interpreter,\r\nM. J. Adendorff.\r\n\r\nThese sworn declarations given before the State Attorney agree in all\r\nthe principal points, and give a clear summary of all the incidents\r\nof the surrender, and from the main points thereof it appears, _inter\r\nalia_:\r\n\r\nThat the second letter, as published above, and which is alleged to\r\nbe from Cronjé to Willoughby, was not issued from Cronjé, but from\r\nCommandant Potgieter, who has undoubtedly taken up the proper\r\nstandpoint, and has followed the general rule in matters of urgency,\r\nsuch as the one in hand, and where the Commandant-General was not\r\npresent in person on the field of battle, first and before treating\r\nwishing to consult with his co-commandants in as far as was possible.\r\n\r\nThat a note such as appears in his declaration was sent by Commandant\r\nCronjé.\r\n\r\nThat neither Commandant Malan nor Commandant Potgieter were present\r\nat the despatch of it.\r\n\r\nThat the reply thereon from Willoughby was received by Commandant\r\nCronjé, as appears in that declaration.\r\n\r\nThat Commandant Cronjé then, in compliance with the note sent by\r\nCommandant Potgieter, as well as the other commandants and officers\r\nmentioned in the declaration of Cronjé, rode up.\r\n\r\nThat Commandant Cronjé then explained his own note.\r\n\r\nThat thereupon also Commandant Malan joined his co-commandants and\r\nofficers, and at this time Commandants Malan, Cronjé, and Potgieter\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nThat after consultation, and with the approval of Commandants Cronjé\r\nand Potgieter, Commandant Malan, by means of the interpreter\r\nAdendorff, had the following said to Dr. Jameson:\r\n\r\n'This is Commandant Malan. He wishes you distinctly to understand\r\nthat no terms can be made here. We have no right to make terms here.\r\nTerms will be made by the Government of the South African Republic.\r\nHe can only secure your lives to Pretoria, until you are handed over\r\nto Commandant-General at Pretoria.'\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Jameson agreed to these terms and accepted them.\r\n\r\nThat thereupon by order of Dr. Jameson the arms were then also laid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThat Commandant Trichardt then appeared with the orders of the\r\nCommandant-General to himself.\r\n\r\nIt now appears that these orders are those which were contained in\r\nthe telegram of which I already sent you a copy by my above-quoted\r\nletter of the 4th March, 1896, and which, after the final regulation\r\nof matters such as had then taken place, was not further acted upon\r\nbecause as regards the surrender negotiations were in fact carried on\r\nin accordance with the orders of the Commandant-General.\r\n\r\nWhile putting aside the question of the surrender there is little to\r\nbe said about the other points contained in the telegram under reply,\r\nthere is one which is considered of sufficient importance by this\r\nGovernment to even still draw the attention of His Excellency the\r\nHigh Commissioner thereto. His Excellency says: 'I may therefore\r\nexplain that an armistice had been agreed to pending my arrival.'\r\n\r\nThe Government here can only think of one other misunderstanding,\r\nthey having at the time of the disturbances at Johannesburg never\r\nrecognized any acting party, for which reason therefore the\r\nconcluding of an armistice was an impossibility.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to tender thanks both to His Honour the\r\nSecretary of State and His Excellency the High Commissioner for the\r\nunprejudiced manner in which they, as against insinuations of a low\r\ncharacter, have made known their feelings with respect to the good\r\nfaith shown by His Honour the State President in his negotiations in\r\nconnection with the question of the surrender of Dr. Jameson's force.\r\n\r\n    I have, etc.,\r\n           C. VAN BOESCHOTEN,\r\n                _Acting State Secretary_.\r\n\r\n  _His Honour H. Cloete,\r\n     Acting British Agent, Pretoria._\r\n\r\n_Appeared before me,_ HERMANUS JACOB COSTER, _State Attorney and\r\nex-officio J.P. of the South African Republic_, PIETER ARNOLDUS\r\nCRONJÉ, _Commandant of the Potchefstroom District, who makes oath and\r\nstates:_\r\n\r\nI was, together with H.P. Malan (Commandant of the Rustenburg\r\nDistrict), and F.J. Potgieter (Commandant of the Krugersdorp\r\nDistrict), one of the commanding officers of the burgher forces\r\nin the fights against Jameson. When I noticed the white flag, I\r\ninstantly ordered De la Rey to approach the enemy. Instead of De la\r\nRey, Hans Klopper, one of the men of Commandant Potgieter, went. He\r\nbrought back a note from Willoughby to me. The contents of the note\r\nwere that if we left them to themselves he promised to withdraw over\r\nthe boundary. In reply I sent him per Hans Klopper the following\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n'John Willoughby,--I acknowledge your note, and this serves as reply,\r\nthat if you guarantee the payment of the expenses which you have\r\noccasioned the South African Republic and surrender your flag\r\ntogether with your weapons I will spare the life of you and yours.\r\nPlease send reply within thirty minutes.'\r\n\r\nWhen this reply was written by me neither Malan nor Potgieter were\r\npresent. Thereupon he answered that he accepted the terms, and\r\nsurrendered himself fully with all his arms into my hands. After\r\nreceiving Willoughby's answer, I rode to Jameson's troops in order to\r\nmeet the other commandants, in accordance with a note sent by\r\nCommandant Potgieter to the enemy. I went with Field-Cornets Maartens\r\nand Van Vuuren to Jameson's troops, and met Jameson. When I met him\r\nI gave him to clearly understand our agreement namely that he must\r\nplainly understand that the last clause was that I guaranteed his\r\nlife and that of his men until I had handed him over to General\r\nJoubert. Thereupon I asked him if he was willing to lay down his flag\r\nand his arms, to which he replied, 'I have no flag; I am willing to\r\nlay down my arms.' Thereupon I asked him if he could declare upon\r\noath that he had no flag, whereupon he declared under oath that he\r\nhad no flag. Then Commandant Malan arrived, and then the three\r\ncommanding officers, Malan, Potgieter and I, were present on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nBefore I began speaking to Malan, Jameson called Willoughby to be\r\npresent. Thereupon Malan and I spoke together about the surrender\r\nof Jameson. Whereupon Malan said, 'We can't decide anything here.\r\nJameson must surrender unconditionally, and he must be plainly given\r\nto understand that we cannot guarantee his life any longer than till\r\nwe have handed him over to General Joubert.' I fully agreed with\r\nMalan, and the interpreter Adendorff was then instructed by the three\r\ncommandants jointly to convey plainly in English to Jameson what the\r\nthree commandants had agreed upon. After this had been done, Jameson\r\nbowed, took his hat off, and said in English that he agreed to the\r\nterms. Thereupon he issued orders to Willoughby to command the\r\nsubordinate officers to lay down their arms. Then the arms were laid\r\ndown. Later on, after the arms had been laid down, Commandant\r\nTrichardt arrived with orders from the Commandant-General, and his\r\nterms were the same as those we had already laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\n  P.A.

I answered thereon in writing\r\nthat I would call the officers together and would then immediately\r\nnotify him. The report received by me I immediately transmitted to\r\nCommandant Cronjé. A short time after I saw Commandant Cronjé with\r\nthe burghers going towards the enemy. I thereupon also went towards\r\nthe enemy and met Commandant Cronjé there. I then attended the\r\ndiscussion as set forth in the declaration given by J.T. Celliers,\r\ndated March 6, 1896, and confirmed by Messrs. Michiel Joseph\r\nAdendorff and Benjamin Johannes Vilgoen.\r\n\r\nThe purport of that discussion is correctly rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n  F.J.

Cronjé, Commandant of the Krugersdorp\r\nDistrict, one of the commanding forces in the fights against Jameson.\r\nOn the morning of January 2, a despatch rider from Commandant\r\nPotgieter came up and informed me that Jameson had hoisted the white\r\nflag, and that I must quickly attend a meeting with the other\r\ncommandants. When I came up to Jameson I found Cronjé and Potgieter\r\nthere; and, as I saw that Cronjé had been speaking to Jameson, I\r\nasked Cronjé 'What is the subject you have been speaking about? I\r\nalso wish to know it.' Cronjé told me that he had agreed with Jameson\r\nthat Jameson would pay the expenses incurred by the State, and that\r\nhe (Cronjé) would spare the lives of Jameson and his people till\r\nPretoria was reached.\r\n\r\nThereupon I answered, 'We cannot make any terms here. We have not the\r\npower to do so. Jameson must surrender unconditionally, and we can\r\nonly guarantee his life until he is delivered over by us into the\r\nhands of the Commandant-General. Then he will have to submit to the\r\ndecision of the Commandant-General and the Government.' When I had\r\nsaid this, Commandant Potgieter answered, 'I agree with that.'\r\nAnd Commandant Cronjé said, 'So be it, brothers.' Thereupon the\r\ninterpreter (Adendorff) was instructed to translate to Jameson\r\nwhat had been spoken. He did so. Jameson thereupon took off his hat,\r\nbowed, and replied in English that he agreed thereto. Jameson then\r\nordered Willoughby, who was present from the moment that I arrived,\r\nto command the subordinate officers to disarm the men, and thereupon\r\nthe arms were given up.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.P. MALAN, _Commandant._\r\n\r\nSworn before me on this the 9th day of March, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n  H.J.

Viljoen,\r\nKrugersdorp, and another Viljoen, whose place of residence is unknown\r\nto me. I asked one of Jameson's troopers where he was. He showed me\r\nthe direction and the place where Jameson was. Jameson thereupon\r\napproached me, and I greeted him. While this took place Commandant\r\nCronjé, the interpreter (Adendorff), and another man whose name is\r\nunknown to me, came. Cronjé was thereupon introduced by Adendorff,\r\nwho spoke English, to Jameson. Thereupon Cronjé said to Jameson, 'I\r\nunderstand that you and your men will surrender yourselves with your\r\nflag and everything you possess?' Jameson said thereupon, 'I fight\r\nunder no flag.'\r\n\r\nCronjé then replied, 'Then I must believe you upon your word that\r\nyou have no flag?' Jameson then said, 'I declare under oath that I\r\npossess no flag.' This conversation was interpreted word for word by\r\nAdendorff. Shortly afterwards Commandant Malan also arrived there. He\r\nasked, 'What is up here? Tell me the news also.' Then Cronjé told\r\nMalan that Jameson would surrender conditionally, whereupon Malan\r\nsaid in effect, 'There can be no question of a conditional surrender\r\nhere, because we have no right to make terms. The surrender must take\r\nplace unconditionally. If terms must be made, it must take place at\r\nPretoria. We can only guarantee his life and that of his men as long\r\nas they are under us, and until the moment when they are handed over\r\nto the Commandant.'\r\n\r\nGeneral Cronjé answered thereupon, 'So be it, brother.' Then\r\nAdendorff asked if he had to interpret this to Jameson, whereupon\r\nMalan said, 'Yes,' and thereupon said in English to Jameson, 'This\r\nis Commandant Malan. He wishes you to distinctly understand that no\r\nterms can be made here. We have no right to make terms here. Terms\r\nwill be made by the Government of the South African Republic. He can\r\nonly secure your lives to Pretoria, until you are handed over to the\r\nCommandant-General at Pretoria.'\r\n\r\nIn reply, Jameson took off his hat, bowed, stepped backwards and\r\nsaid, 'I accept your terms.' Thereupon Jameson ordered Willoughby to\r\ncommand the subordinate officers that the troopers should lay down\r\ntheir arms. The arms were then laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.S.

The marginal remarks are the notes made\r\nby a member of the Reform Committee to whom it was shown.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL REPORT OF THE EXPEDITION THAT LEFT THE PROTECTORATE AT THE\r\nURGENT REQUEST OF THE LEADING CITIZENS OF JOHANNESBURG WITH THE\r\nOBJECT OF STANDING BY THEM AND MAINTAINING LAW AND ORDER WHILST THEY\r\nWERE DEMANDING JUSTICE FROM THE TRANSVAAL AUTHORITIES. By SIR JOHN C.\r\nWILLOUGHBY, BART., Lieutenant-Colonel Commanding Dr. Jameson's\r\nForces.\r\n\r\n[After they had dated the 'urgent' letter, and had wired to Dr.\r\nHarris (December 27): 'We will make our own notation by the aid\r\nof the letter which I shall publish.']\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, December 28, 1895, Dr. Jameson received a Reuter's\r\ntelegram showing that the situation at Johannesburg had become acute.\r\nAt the same time reliable information was received that the Boers in\r\nthe Zeerust and Lichtenburg districts were assembling, and had been\r\nsummoned to march on Johannesburg.\r\n\r\n[The same time as he got the telegrams from Johannesburg and\r\nmessages by Heany and Holden on no account to move.]\r\n\r\nPreparations were at once made to act on the terms of the letter\r\ndated December 20, and already published, and also in accordance with\r\nverbal arrangements with the signatories of that letter--viz., that\r\nshould Dr. Jameson hear that the Boers were collecting, and that the\r\nintentions of the Johannesburg people had become generally known,\r\nhe was at once to come to the aid of the latter with whatever force\r\nhe had available, and without further reference to them, the object\r\nbeing that such force should reach Johannesburg without any conflict.\r\n\r\n[Twaddle--in the face of Hammond's, Phillips's and Sam Jameson's\r\nwire not to move]\r\n\r\nAt 3 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, December 29, everything was in\r\nreadiness at Pitsani Camp.\r\n\r\nThe troops were paraded, and Dr. Jameson read the letter of\r\ninvitation from Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nHe then explained to the force _(a)_ that no hostilities were\r\nintended; _(b)_ that we should only fight if forced to do so in\r\nself-defence; _(c)_ that neither the persons nor property of\r\ninhabitants of the Transvaal were to be molested; _(d)_ that our sole\r\nobject was to help our fellow-men in their extremity, and to ensure\r\ntheir obtaining attention to their just demands.\r\n\r\nDr. Jameson's speech was received with the greatest enthusiasm by the\r\nmen, who cheered most heartily.\r\n\r\nThe above programme was strictly adhered to until the column was\r\nfired upon on the night of the 31st.\r\n\r\nMany Boers, singly and in small parties, were encountered on the line\r\nof march; to one and all of these the pacific nature of the\r\nexpedition was carefully explained.\r\n\r\n[Start from Pitsani.]\r\n\r\nThe force left Pitsani Camp at 6.30 p.m., December 29, and marched\r\nthrough the night.\r\n\r\nAt 5.15 a.m. on the morning of the 30th the column reached the\r\nvillage of Malmani (39 miles distant from Pitsani).\r\n\r\n[Junction effected at Malmani with B.B.P.]\r\n\r\nPrecisely at the same moment the advanced guard of the Mafeking\r\nColumn (under Colonel Grey) reached the village, and the junction was\r\neffected between the two bodies.\r\n\r\nFor details of the composition of the combined force, as also for\r\ngeneral particulars of the march to Krugersdorp, see sketch of the\r\nroute and schedule attached (marked A. and B. respectively).\r\n\r\n[Defile at lead-mines passed.]\r\n\r\nFrom Malmani I pushed on as rapidly as possible in order to cross in\r\ndaylight the very dangerous defile at Lead Mines. This place, distant\r\n71 miles from Pitsani, was passed at 5.30 p.m., December 30.\r\n\r\nI was subsequently informed that a force of several hundred Boers,\r\nsent from Lichtenburg to intercept the force at this point, missed\r\ndoing so by three hours only.\r\n\r\n[Letter from Commandant-General.]\r\n\r\nAt our next 'off-saddle' Dr. Jameson received a letter from the\r\nCommandant-General of the Transvaal demanding to know the reason of\r\nour advance, and ordering us to return immediately. A reply was sent\r\nto this, explaining Dr. Jameson's reasons in the same terms as those\r\nused to the force at Pitsani.\r\n\r\n[Letter from High Commissioner.]\r\n\r\nAt Doornport (91 miles from Pitsani), during an 'off-saddle' early on\r\nTuesday morning, December 31, a mounted messenger overtook us, and\r\npresented a letter from the High Commissioner, which contained an\r\norder to Dr. Jameson and myself to return at once to Mafeking and\r\nPitsani.\r\n\r\n[Reasons for not retreating.]\r\n\r\nA retreat by now was out of the question, and to comply with these\r\ninstructions an impossibility. In the first place, there was\r\nabsolutely no food for men or horses along the road which we had\r\nrecently followed; secondly, three days at least would be necessary\r\nfor our horses, jaded with forced marching, to return; on the road\r\nahead we were sure of finding, at all events, some food for man and\r\nbeast. Furthermore, we had by now traversed almost two-thirds of the\r\ntotal distance; a large force of Boers was known to be intercepting\r\nour retreat, and we were convinced that any retrograde movement would\r\nbring on an attack of Boers from all sides.\r\n\r\nIt was felt, therefore, that to ensure the safety of our little\r\nforce, no alternative remained but to push on to Krugersdorp to our\r\nfriends, who we were confident would be awaiting our arrival there.\r\n\r\nApart from the above considerations, even had it been possible to\r\neffect a retreat from Doornport, we knew that Johannesburg had risen,\r\nand felt that by turning back we should be shamefully deserting those\r\ncoming to meet us.\r\n\r\n[They could not possibly _know_ it, because the rising--_i.e._\r\nthe public arming and moving of men--only began at the very hour\r\nthey claim to have _known_ it, and because the first news from\r\nJohannesburg only reached them 24 hours later by the two cyclists\r\n'Oh what a tangled web we weave, when--']\r\n\r\nFinally, it appeared to us impossible to turn back, in view of the\r\nfact that we had been urgently called in to avert a massacre, which\r\nwe had been assured would be imminent in the event of a crisis such\r\nas had now occurred.\r\n\r\n[_Vide_ the telegrams and messages to stop! How noble!]\r\n\r\n[Boer scouts.]\r\n\r\nNear Boon's store, on the evening of the 31st, an advanced patrol\r\nfell in with Lieutenant Eloff, of the Krugersdorp Volunteers. This\r\nofficer, in charge of a party of 15 scouts, had come out to gain\r\nintelligence of our movements. He was detained whilst our intentions\r\nwere fully explained to him, and then released at Dr. Jameson's\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n[First skirmish New Year's Eve.]\r\n\r\nAt midnight (New Year's Eve), while the advanced scouts were crossing\r\na rocky wooded ridge at right angles to and barring the line of\r\nadvance, they were fired on by a party of 40 Boers, who had posted\r\nthemselves in this position. The scouts, reinforced by the advanced\r\nguard, under Inspector Straker, drove off their assailants after a\r\nshort skirmish, during which one trooper of the M.M.P. was wounded.\r\n\r\nAt Van Oudtshoorn's, early on the following morning (January 1), Dr.\r\nJameson received a second letter from the High Commissioner, to which\r\nhe replied in writing.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 a.m. the march was resumed in the usual day formation. After\r\nmarching two miles, the column got clear of the hills and emerged\r\ninto open country.\r\n\r\n[10.15 a.m.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Inspector Drury, in command of the rearguard, sent\r\nword that a force of about 100 Boers was following him about one mile\r\nin rear. I thereupon reinforced the rearguard, hitherto consisting of\r\na troop and one Maxim, by an additional half-troop and another Maxim.\r\n\r\n[11 a.m.]\r\n\r\nAbout 5 miles beyond Van Oudtshoorn's store the column was met by two\r\ncyclists bearing letters from several leaders of the Johannesburg\r\nReform Committee. These letters expressed the liveliest approval and\r\ndelight at our speedy approach, and finally contained a renewal of\r\ntheir promise to meet the column with a force at Krugersdorp.{55} The\r\nmessengers also reported that only 300 armed Boers were in the town.\r\n\r\nThis news was communicated to the troops, who received it with loud\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nWhen within two miles of Hind's store, the column was delayed by\r\nextensive wire-fencing, which ran for one and a half miles on either\r\nside of the road, and practically constituted a defile.\r\n\r\nWhile the column was halted and the wire being cut, the country for\r\nsome distance on both sides was carefully scouted.\r\n\r\nBy this means it was ascertained that there was a considerable force\r\nof Boers (1) on the left front, (2) in the immediate front\r\n(retreating hastily on Krugersdorp), (3) a third party on the right\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nThe force which had been following the column from Van Oudtshoorn's\r\ncontinued to hover in the rear.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel White, in command of the advanced guard, sent back\r\na request for guns to be pushed forward as a precaution in case of\r\nan attack from the Boers in front. By the time these guns reached the\r\nadvanced guard, the Boers were still retreating some two miles off. A\r\nfew rounds were then fired in their direction. Had Colonel White, in\r\nthe first instance, opened fire with his Maxims on the Boers, whom he\r\nsurprised watering their horses close to Hind's store, considerable\r\nloss would have been inflicted; but this was not our object, for with\r\nthe exception of the small skirmish on the previous night, the Boers\r\nhad not as yet molested the column, whose sole aim was to reach\r\nJohannesburg if possible without fighting.\r\n\r\n[1.30 p.m.]\r\n\r\nAt this hour Hind's store was reached.\r\n\r\nHere the troops rested for one and a half hours.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, hardly any provisions for men and horses were\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n[3 p.m.]\r\n\r\nAn officers' patrol, consisting of Major Villiers (Royal Horse\r\nGuards) and Lieutenant Grenfell (1st Life Guards) and six men, moved\r\noff for the purpose of reconnoitring the left flank of the Boer\r\nposition, while Captain Lindsell, with his permanent force of\r\nadvanced scouts, pushed on as usual to reconnoitre the approach by\r\nthe main road. At the same time I forwarded a note to the Commandant\r\nof the forces in Krugersdorp to the effect that, in the event of my\r\nfriendly force meeting with opposition on its approach, I should be\r\nforced to shell the town, and that therefore I gave him this warning\r\nin order that the women and children might be moved out of danger.\r\n\r\n[Friendly!]\r\n\r\nTo this note, which was despatched by a Boer who had been detained at\r\nVan Oudtshoorn, I received no reply.\r\n\r\nAt Hind's store we were informed that the force in our front had\r\nincreased during the forenoon to about 800 men, of whom a large\r\nnumber were entrenched on the hillside.\r\n\r\n[4.30 p.m.]\r\n\r\nFour miles beyond Hind's store, the column following the scouts,\r\nwhich met with no opposition, ascended a steep rise of some 400 feet,\r\nand came full in view of the Boer position on the opposite side of\r\na deep valley, traversed by a broad \"sluit\" or muddy water course.\r\n\r\nStanding on the plateau or spur, on which our force was forming up\r\nfor action, the view to our front was as follows:\r\n\r\nPassing through our position to the west ran the Hind's\r\nstore--Krugersdorp Road traversing the valley and the Boer position\r\nalmost at right angles to both lines.\r\n\r\nImmediately to the north of this road, at the point where it\r\ndisappeared over the sky-line on the opposite slope, lay the Queen's\r\nBattery House and earthworks, completely commanding the valley on all\r\nsides and distant 1,900 yards from our standpoint.\r\n\r\nSome 1,000 yards down the valley to the north stood a farmhouse,\r\nsurrounded by a dense plantation, which flanked the valley.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the opposite slope, and adjacent to the road, stood an\r\niron house which commanded the drift where the road crossed the\r\nabove-mentioned watercourse.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the road, and immediately opposite the\r\nlast-named iron house, an extensive rectangular stone wall enclosure\r\nwith high trees formed an excellent advanced central defensive\r\nposition. Further up the slope, some 500 yards to the south of this\r\nenclosure, stretched a line of rifle-pits, which were again flanked\r\nto the south by 'prospecting' trenches. On the sky-line numbers of\r\nBoers were apparent to our front and right front.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the plateau we had observed small parties of Boers\r\nhurrying towards Krugersdorp, and immediately on reaching the high\r\nground the rearguard was attacked by the Boer force which had\r\nfollowed the column during the whole morning.\r\n\r\nI therefore had no further hesitation in opening fire on the\r\nKrugersdorp position.\r\n\r\n[4.30 p.m.]\r\n\r\nThe two seven-pounders and the 12-1/2 pounder opened on the Boer\r\nline, making good practice under Captain Kincaid-Smith and Captain\r\nGosling at 1,900 yards.\r\n\r\n[It must have been here that the waggon-loads of dead Boers\r\nweren't found.]\r\n\r\n[5 p.m.]\r\n\r\nThis fire was kept up until 5 p.m. The Boers made practically no\r\nreply, but lay quiet in the trenches and battery.\r\n\r\nScouts having reported that most of the trenches were evacuated, the\r\nfirst line consisting of the advanced guard (a troop of 100 men),\r\nunder Colonel White advanced. Two Maxims accompanied this force; a\r\nstrong troop with a Maxim formed the right and left supports on\r\neither flank.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Grey, with one troop B.B.P. and one Maxim, had\r\nbeen previously detailed to move round and attack the Boers' left.\r\n\r\nThe remaining two troops, with three Maxims, formed the reserve and\r\nrearguard.\r\n\r\nThe first line advance continued unopposed to within 200 yards of the\r\nwatercourse, when it was checked by an exceedingly heavy cross-fire\r\nfrom all points of the defence.\r\n\r\nColonel White then pushed his skirmishers forward into and beyond the\r\nwatercourse.\r\n\r\nThe left support under Inspector Dykes then advanced to prolong the\r\nfirst line to the left, but, diverging too much to his left this\r\nofficer experienced a very hot flanking fire from the farmhouse and\r\nplantation, and was driven back with some loss.\r\n\r\nColonel Grey meanwhile had pushed round on the extreme right and come\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\n[5.30 p.m.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Major Villiers' patrol returned and reported that the\r\ncountry to our right was open, and that we could easily move round in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nIt was now evident that the Boers were in great force, and intended\r\nholding their position.\r\n\r\nWithout the arrival of the Johannesburg force in rear of the\r\nBoers--an event which I had been momentarily expecting--I did not\r\nfeel justified in pushing a general attack, which would have\r\ncertainly entailed heavy losses on my small force.\r\n\r\n[When Celliers and Rowlands left them at 11 a.m. they had not\r\nexpected anyone. _Vide_ Cellier's report and Colonel H.E. White's\r\nletter.]\r\n\r\n[6.15 p.m.]\r\n\r\nI accordingly left Inspector Drury with one troop and one Maxim to\r\nkeep in check the Boers who were now lining the edge of the plateau\r\nto our left, and placed Colonel Grey with two troops B.B.P., one\r\n12-1/2 pounder, and one Maxim to cover our left flank and continue\r\nfiring on the battery and trenches south of the road.\r\n\r\nI then made a general flank movement to the right with the remaining\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nColonel Grey succeeded in shelling the Boers out of their advanced\r\nposition during the next half-hour, and blew up the battery house.\r\n\r\n[Flank movement.]\r\n\r\nUnder this cover the column moved off as far as the first houses\r\nof the Randfontein group of mines, the Boers making no attempt to\r\nintercept the movement.\r\n\r\nNight was now fast approaching, and still there were no signs of the\r\npromised help from Johannesburg. I determined, therefore, to push\r\non with all speed in the direction of that town, trusting in the\r\ndarkness to slip through any intervening opposition.\r\n\r\nTwo guides were obtained, the column formed in the prescribed night\r\norder of march, and we started off along a road leading direct to\r\nJohannesburg.\r\n\r\nAt this moment heavy rifle and Maxim fire was suddenly heard from the\r\ndirection of Krugersdorp, which lay 1-1/2 miles to the left rear.\r\n\r\nWe at once concluded that this could only be the arrival of the\r\nlong-awaited reinforcements, for we knew that Johannesburg had\r\nMaxims, and that the Staats'-Artillerie were not expected to arrive\r\nuntil the following morning. To leave our supposed friends in the\r\nlurch was out of the question. I determined at once to move to their\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n[Long awaited! Why, this was only 6 hours since the cyclists left.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the carts escorted by one troop on the road I advanced\r\nrapidly across the plateau towards Krugersdorp in the direction of\r\nthe firing, in the formation shown in the accompanying sketch.\r\n\r\nAfter advancing thus for nearly a mile the firing ceased, and we\r\nperceived the Boers moving in great force to meet the column. The\r\nflankers on the right reported another force threatening that flank.\r\n\r\nFearing that an attempt would be made to cut us off from the\r\nammunition carts, I ordered a retreat on them.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that the firing, whatever might have been the cause\r\nthereof, was not occasioned by the arrival of any force from\r\nJohannesburg.\r\n\r\n[This is really magnificent!]\r\n\r\nPrecious moments had been lost in the attempt to stand by our friends\r\nat all costs, under the mistaken supposition that they could not fail\r\nto carry out their repeated promises,{56} renewed to us by letter so\r\nlately as 11 a.m. this same day. It was now very nearly dark. In\r\nthe dusk the Boers could be seen closing in on three sides--viz.,\r\nnorth, east, and south. The road to Johannesburg appeared completely\r\nbarred, and the last opportunity of slipping through, which had\r\npresented itself an hour ago when the renewed firing was heard, was\r\ngone not to return.\r\n\r\n[Bivouac, January 1.]\r\n\r\nNothing remained but to bivouac in the best position available.\r\n\r\nBut for the unfortunate circumstance of the firing, which we\r\nafterwards heard was due to the exultation of the Boers at the\r\narrival of large reinforcements from Potchefstroom, the column would\r\nhave been by this time (7 p.m.) at least four or five miles further\r\non the road to Johannesburg, with an excellent chance of reaching\r\nthat town without further opposition.\r\n\r\nI moved the column to the edge of a wide vley to the right of the\r\nroad, and formed the horses in quarter-column under cover of the\r\nslope. The carts were formed up in rear and on both flanks, and five\r\nMaxims were placed along the front so as to sweep the plateau.\r\n\r\nThe other three Maxims and the heavy guns were posted on the rear and\r\nflank faces.\r\n\r\nThe men were then directed to lie down between the guns and on the\r\nside; sentries and cossack posts were posted on each face.\r\nMeantime the Boers had occupied the numerous prospecting trenches and\r\ncuttings on the plateau at distances from 400 to 800 yards.\r\n\r\n[9 p.m.]\r\n\r\nAt 9 p.m. a heavy fire was opened on the bivouac, and a storm of\r\nbullets swept over and around us, apparently directed from all sides\r\nexcept the south-west.\r\n\r\nThe troops were protected by their position on the slope below the\r\nlevel of the plateau, so that the total loss from this fire, which\r\nlasted about twenty minutes, was very inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe men behaved with admirable coolness, and were as cheery as\r\npossible, although very tired and hungry and without water.\r\n\r\nWe were then left unmolested for two or three hours.\r\n\r\n[Midnight.]\r\n\r\nAbout midnight another shower of bullets was poured into the camp,\r\nbut the firing was not kept up for long.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later a Maxim gun opened on the bivouac, but failed to get\r\nour range.\r\n\r\n[Thursday, January 2.]\r\n\r\nAt 3.30 a.m. patrols were pushed out on all sides, while the force as\r\nsilently and rapidly as possible was got ready to move off.\r\n\r\nAt 4 a.m. a heavy fire was opened by the Boers on the column, and the\r\npatrols driven in from the north and east sides.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of Major R. White (assisted by Lieutenant\r\nJesser-Coope) the column was formed under cover of the slope.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the patrols which had been sent out to the south\r\nreturned, and reported that the ground was clear of the Boers in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe growing light enabled us to ascertain that the Boers in force\r\nwere occupying pits to our left and lining the railway embankment\r\nfor a distance of one and a half miles right across the direct road\r\nto Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nI covered the movements of the main body with the B.B.P. and two\r\nMaxims under Colonel Grey along the original left front of the\r\nbivouac, and two troops M.M.P., under Major K. White on the right\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the firing was excessively heavy; however the\r\nmain body was partially sheltered by the slope.\r\n\r\nColonel White then led the advance for a mile across the vley without\r\ncasualty, but on reaching the opposite rise near the Oceanic Mine,\r\nwas subjected to a very heavy long-range fire. Colonel White hereupon\r\nvery judiciously threw out one troop to the left to cover the further\r\nadvance of the main body.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat delayed, after crossing the rise, by the\r\ndisappearance of our volunteer guide of the previous night.\r\n\r\nSome little time elapsed before another guide could be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Lieutenant-Colonel Grey withdrew his force and the\r\ncovering Maxims out of action under the protection of the M.M.P.\r\ncovering troops, and rejoined the main body.\r\n\r\n[5 a.m.]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Colonel Grey was shot in the foot, but most\r\ngallantly insisted on carrying on his duties until the close of the\r\naction.\r\n\r\nSub-Inspector Cazalet was also wounded here, but continued in action\r\nuntil he was shot again in the chest at Doornkop.\r\n\r\nWhile crossing the ridge the column was subjected to a very heavy\r\nfire, and several men and horses were lost here.\r\n\r\nI detailed a rearguard of one troop and two Maxims, under Major R.\r\nWhite, to cover our rear and left flank, and move the remainder of\r\nthe troops in the ordinary day formation as rapidly forward as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn this formation a running rear and flank guard fight was kept up\r\nfor ten miles. Wherever the features of the ground admitted, a stand\r\nwas made by various small detachments of the rear and flank guard.\r\nIn this manner the Boers were successfully kept a distance of 500\r\nyards, and repulsed in all their efforts to reach the rear and flank\r\nof the main body.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the various mines and the village of Randfontein\r\nwe met with hearty expressions of goodwill from the mining\r\npopulation, who professed a desire to help if only they had arms.\r\n\r\n[8 a.m.]\r\n\r\nTen miles from the start I received intelligence from Colonel Grey,\r\nat the head of the column, that Doornkop, a hill near the\r\nSpeitfontein mine, was held by 400 Boers, directly barring our line\r\nof advance.\r\n\r\nI repaired immediately to the front, Colonel White remaining with the\r\nrear-guard.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the head of the column, I found the guns shelling a\r\nridge which our guide stated was Doornkop.\r\n\r\nThe excellent dispositions for the attack made by Colonel Grey were\r\nthen carried out.\r\n\r\nThe B.B.P., under Major Coventry, who I regret to say was severely\r\nwounded and lost several of his men, attacked and cleared the ridge\r\nin most gallant style and pushed on beyond it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Inspector Barry received the wound which we have\r\nlearnt with grief has subsequently proved fatal.\r\n\r\nChief-Inspector Bodle at the same time, with two troops M.M.P.,\r\ncharged, and drove off the field a large force of Boers threatening\r\nour left flank.\r\n\r\nThe guide had informed us that the road to the right of the hill was\r\nimpassable, and that there was open and easy country to the left.\r\n\r\nThis information was misleading. I afterwards ascertained that\r\nwithout storming the Boer position there was no road open to\r\nJohannesburg except by a wide detour of many miles to the right.\r\n\r\n[8.30 a.m.]\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dr. Jameson received a letter from the High\r\nCommissioner again ordering us to desist in our advance. Dr. Jameson\r\ninformed me at the same time of the most disheartening news, viz.,\r\nthat he had received a message stating that Johannesburg would not\r\nor could not come to our assistance, and that we must fight our way\r\nthrough unaided.\r\n\r\nThinking that the first ridge now in our hands was Doornkop, we again\r\npushed rapidly on, only to find that in rear of the ridge another\r\nsteep and stony kopje, some 400 feet in height, was held by hundreds\r\nof Boers completely covered from our fire.\r\n\r\nThis kopje effectually flanked the road over which the column must\r\nadvance at a distance of 400 yards. Scouting showed that there was no\r\nway of getting round this hill.\r\n\r\nSurrounded on all sides by the Boers, men and horses wearied out,\r\noutnumbered by at least six to one, our friends having failed to\r\nkeep their promises to meet us, and my force reduced numerically\r\nby one-fourth, I no longer considered that I was justified in\r\nsacrificing any more of the lives of the men under me.\r\n\r\n[Wonderfully considerate! seeing how they deliberately risked the\r\nlives of thousands in Johannesburg when they started.]\r\n\r\nAs previously explained, our object in coming had been to render\r\nassistance, without bloodshed if possible, to the inhabitants of\r\nJohannesburg. This object would in no way be furthered by a hopeless\r\nattempt to cut our way through overwhelming numbers, an attempt,\r\nmoreover which must without any doubt have entailed heavy and useless\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n[9.15 a.m.]\r\n\r\nWith Dr. Jameson's permission, I therefore sent word to the\r\nCommandant that we would surrender provided that he would give a\r\nguarantee of safe conduct out of the country to every member of the\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nTo this Commandant Cronjé replied by a guarantee of the lives of all,\r\nprovided that we would lay down our arms and pay all expenses.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this guarantee of the lives of all, Commandant Malan\r\nsubsequently repudiated the guarantee in so far as to say that he\r\nwould not answer for the lives of the leaders, but this was not until\r\nour arms had been given up and the force at the mercy of the Boers.\r\n\r\nI attribute our failure to reach Johannesburg in a great measure to\r\nloss of time from the following causes:\r\n\r\n(1) The delay occasioned by the demonstration in front of\r\nKrugersdorp, which had been assigned as the place of junction with\r\nthe Johannesburg force.\r\n\r\n(2) The non-arrival of that force at Krugersdorp or of the guides to\r\nthe Krugersdorp-Johannesburg section of the road, as previously\r\npromised by Johannesburg.\r\n\r\n(3) The delay consequent on moving to the firing of the supposed\r\nJohannesburg column just before dark on Wednesday evening.\r\n\r\n[How is it that nothing was said of this to Celliers and Rowland;\r\nnothing in the Letter of Colonel White and Dr. Jameson which they\r\nwrote at 11 a.m. Wednesday; nothing in the message sent by Bugler\r\nVallé, who was despatched on Thursday before daybreak _after_ the\r\nKrugersdorp light? How is it that if the forces were to meet at\r\nKrugersdorp Dr. Jameson telegraphed to Dr. Wolff to meet him\r\n_en route,_ so as to decide whether to turn off _20 miles before\r\nreaching Krugersdorp_ and march direct on Pretoria or go into\r\nJohannesburg first?]\r\n\r\nI append (1) a sketch-map of the route from Pitsani to Krugersdorp,\r\nmarked A. This distance (154 miles) was covered in just under 70\r\nhours, the horses having been off-saddled ten times. The 169 miles\r\nbetween Pitsani and Doornkop occupied 86 hours, during 17 of which\r\nthe men were engaged with the Boers, and were practically without\r\nfood or water, having had their last meal at 8 a.m. on the morning of\r\nthe 1st January at Van Oudtshoorn's, 17 miles from Krugersdorp.\r\n\r\nThe average weight carried by each horse was 16 stone.\r\n\r\n(2) List of officers engaged in the expedition and composition of the\r\nforce marked B. From this it will be seen that there was a total of\r\n494 men and officers (exclusive of staff).\r\n\r\n(3) Plans of engagements at Krugersdorp and Doornkop, and of the\r\nbivouac on the night of January 1st.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this narrative without testifying to the very great\r\ngallantry and endurance of all officers, non-commissioned officers,\r\nand troopers under my command in the field and on the march under\r\nmost trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF FORCE.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Willoughby, Royal\r\n      Horse Guards                                 Commanding.\r\n  Major Hon.

July, 1899. In the Report of the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons (No. 311 of 1897), page 298, are the following:--\r\n\r\nSir Henry Campbell Bannerman: \"Did you understand that you were to\r\nmeet a considerable force at Krugersdorp coming from Johannesburg?\"\r\n\r\nSir John Willoughby: _Not when we started_ from Pitsani, but\r\ncertainly after the letters received from the cyclists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nMANIFESTO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I am deeply sensible of the honour conferred upon me by being\r\nelected chairman of the National Union, I am profoundly impressed\r\nwith the responsibilities attached to the position. The issues to be\r\nfaced in this country are so momentous in character that it has been\r\ndecided that prior to the holding of a public meeting a review of the\r\ncondition of affairs should be placed in your hands, in order that\r\nyou may consider matters quietly in your homes. It has also been\r\ndecided that it will be wise to postpone the meeting which was to\r\nhave taken place on the 27th December until the 6th day of January\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nOn that day you will have made up your minds on the various points\r\nsubmitted to you, and we will ask you for direction as to our future\r\ncourse of action. It is almost unnecessary to recount all the steps\r\nwhich have been taken by the National Union, and I shall therefore\r\nconfine myself to a very short review of what has been done.\r\n\r\nTHE THREE PLANKS.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the National Union is very simple. The three\r\nobjects which we set before ourselves are: (1) The maintenance of\r\nthe independence of the Republic, (2) the securing of equal rights,\r\nand (3) the redress of grievances. This brief but comprehensive\r\nprogramme has never been lost sight of, and I think we may\r\nchallenge contradiction fearlessly when we assert that we have\r\nconstitutionally, respectfully, and steadily prosecuted our purpose.\r\nLast year you will remember a respectful petition, praying for the\r\nfranchise, signed by 13,000 men, was received with contemptuous\r\nlaughter and jeers in the Volksraad. This year the Union, apart\r\nfrom smaller matters, endeavoured to do three things.\r\n\r\nTHE RAAD ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\nFirst we were told that a Progressive spirit was abroad, that twelve\r\nout of twenty-four members of the First Volksraad had to be elected,\r\nand we might reasonably hope for reform by the type of broad-minded\r\nmen who would be elected. It was therefore resolved that we should do\r\neverything in our power to assist in the election of the best men who\r\nwere put up by the constituencies, and everything that the law\r\npermitted us to do in this direction was done.\r\n\r\nDISAPPOINTED HOPES.\r\n\r\nThe result has been only too disappointing, as the record of the\r\ndebates and the division list in the Volksraad prove. We were\r\nmoreover told that public speeches in Johannesburg prevented the\r\nProgressive members from getting a majority of the Raad to listen to\r\nour requests, that angry passions were inflamed, and that if we would\r\nonly hold our tongues reform would be brought about. We therefore\r\nresolved in all loyalty to abstain from inflaming angry passions,\r\nalthough we never admitted we had by act or speech given reason for\r\nlegislators to refuse justice to all. Hence our silence for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAY CONCESSION NEXT.\r\n\r\nWe used all our influence to get the Volksraad to take over the\r\nrailway concession, but, alas! the President declared with tears in\r\nhis voice that the independence of the country was wrapped up in this\r\nquestion, and a submissive Raad swept the petitions from the table.\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCHISE PETITION.\r\n\r\nOur great effort however was the petition for the franchise, with the\r\nmoderate terms of which you are all acquainted. This petition was\r\nsigned by more than 38,000 persons. What was the result? We were\r\ncalled unfaithful for not naturalizing ourselves, when naturalization\r\nmeans only that we should give up our original citizenship and get\r\nnothing in return, and become subject to disabilities. Members had\r\nthe calm assurance to state, without any grounds whatever, that\r\nthe signatures were forgeries; and, worst of all, one member in an\r\ninflammatory speech challenged us openly to fight for our rights, and\r\nhis sentiment seemed to meet with considerable approval. This is the\r\ndisappointing result of our honest endeavours to bring about a fusion\r\nbetween the people of this State, and the true union and equality\r\nwhich alone can be the basis of prosperity and peace. You all know\r\nthat as the law now stands we are virtually excluded for ever from\r\ngetting the franchise, and by a malignant ingenuity our children born\r\nhere are deprived of the rights of citizenship unless their fathers\r\ntake an oath of allegiance, which brings them nothing but\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\nTHE BITTER CRY OF THE 'UITLANDER.'\r\n\r\nWe are the vast majority in this State. We own more than half the\r\nland, and, taken in the aggregate, we own at least nine-tenths of the\r\nproperty in this country; yet in all matters affecting our lives, our\r\nliberties, and our properties, we have absolutely no voice. Dealing\r\nnow first with the legislature, we find taxation is imposed upon\r\nus without any representation whatever, that taxation is wholly\r\ninequitable, _(a)_ because a much greater amount is levied from the\r\npeople than is required for the needs of Government; _(b)_ because it\r\nis either class taxation pure and simple, or by the selection of the\r\nsubjects, though nominally universal, it is made to fall upon our\r\nshoulders; and _(c)_ because the necessaries of life are unduly\r\nburdened.\r\n\r\nABUSE OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\nExpenditure is not controlled by any public official independent of\r\nthe Government. Vast sums are squandered, while the Secret Service\r\nFund is a dark mystery to everybody. But, essential as the power to\r\ncontrol taxation and expenditure is to a free people, there are other\r\nmatters of the gravest importance which are equally precious.\r\nThe Legislature in this country is the supreme power, apparently\r\nuncontrolled by any fixed Constitution. The chance will of a majority\r\nin a Legislature elected by one-third of the people is capable of\r\ndominating us in every relation of life, and when we remember that\r\nthose who hold power belong to a different race, speak a different\r\nlanguage, and have different pursuits from ourselves, that they\r\nregard us with suspicion, and even hostility; that, as a rule, they\r\nare not educated men, and that their passions are played upon by\r\nunscrupulous adventurers, it must be admitted that we are in very\r\ngrave danger.\r\n\r\nTRIBUTE TO THE MODERATES.\r\n\r\nI think it is but just to bear tribute to the patriotic endeavours of\r\na small band of enlightened men in the Volksraad who have earnestly\r\ncondemned the policy of the Government and warned them of its danger.\r\nTo Mr. Jeppe, Mr. Lucas Meyer, the De Jagers, Mr. Loveday, and a few\r\nothers in the First Raad, leaving out the second Raad, we owe our\r\nbest thanks, for they have fought our battle and confirmed the\r\njustice of our cause. But when we look to the debates of the last\r\nfew years, what do we find? All through a spirit of hostility, all\r\nthrough an endeavour not to meet the just wants of the people, not\r\nto remove grievances, not to establish the claim to our loyalty by\r\njust treatment and equal laws, but to repress the publication of\r\nthe truth, however much it might be required in the public interest,\r\nto prevent us from holding public meetings, to interfere with the\r\nCourts, and to keep us in awe by force.\r\n\r\nTHE POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVE.\r\n\r\nThere is now threatened a danger even graver than those which have\r\npreceded it. The Government is seeking to get through the Legislature\r\nan Act which will vest in the Executive the power to decide whether\r\nmen have been guilty of sedition, and to deport them and confiscate\r\ntheir goods. The Volksraad has by resolution affirmed the principle,\r\nand has instructed the Government to bring up a Bill accordingly next\r\nsession. To-day this power rests justly with the courts of law, and I\r\ncan only say that if this Bill becomes law the power of the Executive\r\nGovernment of this country would be as absolute as the power of the\r\nCzar of Russia. We shall have said goodbye finally to the last\r\nprinciple of liberty.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT KRUGER INDICTED.\r\n\r\nComing to the Executive Government, we find that there is no true\r\nresponsibility to the people, none of the great departments of State\r\nare controlled by Ministerial officers in the proper sense, the\r\nPresident's will is virtually supreme, and he, with his unique\r\ninfluence over the legislators of the House, State-aided by an able\r\nif hostile State Secretary, has been the author of every act directed\r\nagainst the liberties of the people. It is well that this should be\r\nrecognized. It is well that President Kruger should be known for what\r\nhe is, and that once for all the false pedestal on which he has so\r\nlong stood should be destroyed. I challenge contradiction when I\r\nstate that no important Act has found a place on the Statute-book\r\nduring the last ten years without the seal of President Kruger's will\r\nupon it; nay, he is the father of every such Act. Remember that\r\nall legislation is initiated by the Government, and, moreover,\r\nPresident Kruger has expressly supported every Act by which we and\r\nour children have been deprived by progressive steps of the right to\r\nacquire franchise, by which taxation has been imposed upon us almost\r\nexclusively, and by which the right and the liberty of the Press and\r\nthe right of public meeting have been attacked.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGES AND THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the judicial system. The High Court of this country\r\nhas, in the absence of representation, been the sole guardian of\r\nour liberties. Although it has on the whole done its work ably,\r\naffairs are in a very unsatisfactory position. The judges have\r\nbeen underpaid, their salaries have never been secure, the most\r\nundignified treatment has been meted out to them, and the status\r\nand independence of the Bench have on more than one occasion been\r\nattacked. A deliberate attempt was made two years ago by President\r\nKruger and the Government to reduce the bench to a position\r\nsubordinate to the Executive Government, and only recently we had in\r\nthe Witfontein matter the last of the cases in which the Legislature\r\ninterfered with vested rights of action. The administration of\r\njustice by minor officials, by native commissioners, and by\r\nfield-cornets, has produced, and is producing, the gravest unrest in\r\nthe country; and, lastly, gentlemen,\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BULWARK OF LIBERTY,\r\n\r\nthe right to trial by jurymen who are our peers, is denied to us.\r\nOnly the burgher or naturalized burgher is entitled to be a juryman;\r\nor, in other words, anyone of us is liable to be tried upon the\r\ngravest charge possible by jurymen who are in no sense our peers, who\r\nbelong to a different race, who regard us with a greater or lesser\r\ndegree of hostility, and whose passions, if inflamed, might prompt\r\nthem, as weak human creatures, to inflict the gravest injustice, even\r\nto deprive men of their lives. Supposing, in the present tense\r\ncondition of political feeling, any one of us were tried before a\r\nBoer jury on any charge having a political flavour about it, should\r\nwe be tried by our peers, and should we have a chance of receiving\r\neven-handed justice?\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET SERVICE FUND.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the Administration, we find that there is the\r\ngrossest extravagance, that Secret Service moneys are squandered,\r\nthat votes are exceeded, that the public credit is pledged, as it was\r\npledged in the case of the Netherlands Railway Company, and later\r\nstill in the case of the Selati Railway, in a manner which is wholly\r\ninconsistent with the best interests of the people.\r\n\r\nSQUANDERING THE PUBLIC REVENUE.\r\n\r\nThe Delagoa Bay festivities are an instance of a reckless disregard\r\nof a Parliamentary vote; £20,000 was voted for those useless\r\nfestivities--about £60,000 was really expended, and I believe certain\r\nfavoured gentlemen hailing from Holland derived the principal\r\nbenefit. It is said that £400,000 of our money has been transferred\r\nfor some extraordinary purpose to Holland. Recently £17,000 is said\r\nto have been sent out of the country with Dr. Leyds for Secret\r\nService purposes, and the public audit seems a farce. When the\r\nProgressive members endeavoured to get an explanation about large\r\nsums of money they were silenced by a vote of the majority\r\nprompted by President Kruger. The administration of the public\r\nservice is in a scandalous condition.\r\n\r\nA CORRUPT LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nBribery and corruption are rampant. We have had members of the Raad\r\naccepting presents of imported spiders and watches wholesale from men\r\nwho were applying for concessions, and we have the singular fact that\r\nin every instance the recipient of the gift voted for the concession.\r\nWe have the President openly stating that such acceptance of presents\r\nwas wholly moral. We have a condition of affairs in which the time\r\nof the meeting of the Volksraad is looked upon as the period of the\r\ngreatest danger to our interests, and it is an open secret that a\r\nclass of man has sprung up who is in constant attendance upon the\r\nmembers of the Volksraad, and whose special business appears to be\r\nthe 'influencing' of members one way or the other. It is openly\r\nstated that enormous sums of money have been spent, some to produce\r\nillegitimate results, some to guard against fresh attacks upon vested\r\nrights. The Legislature passed an Act solemnly denouncing corruption\r\nin the public service. One man, not an official, was punished under\r\nthe law, but nothing has ever been done since to eradicate the evil.\r\n\r\nAND A TAINTED CIVIL SERVICE.\r\n\r\nI think thousands of you are satisfied of the venality of many of our\r\npublic servants. I wish to guard against the assumption that all\r\npublic servants are corrupt. Thank God there are many who are able\r\nand honourable men, and it must be gall and wormwood to these men to\r\nfind the whole tone of the service destroyed, and to have themselves\r\nmade liable to be included under one general denunciation. But there\r\ncan be no health in an administration, and the public morals must be\r\nsapped also, when such things as the Smit case, and the recent\r\nStiemens case, go unnoticed and unpunished.\r\n\r\nTWO GLARING CASES.\r\n\r\nI think it right to state openly what those cases are. N.J. Smit\r\nis the son of a member of the Government. He absented himself for\r\nmonths without leave. He was meantime charged in the newspapers\r\nwith embezzlement. He returned, was fined £25 for being absent\r\nwithout leave, and was reinstated in office. He is now the Mining\r\nCommissioner of Klerksdorp. He has been charged in at least two\r\nnewspapers--one of them a Dutch newspaper, _Land en Volk_, published\r\nwithin a stone's throw of the Government Office--with being an\r\n'unpunished thief,' and yet the Government have taken no notice of\r\nit, nor has he thought fit to bring an action to clear himself. In\r\nthe Stiemens case two officials in the Mining Department admitted in\r\nthe witness-box that they had agreed to further the application of a\r\nrelative for the grant of a piece of public land at Johannesburg on\r\ncondition that they were each to receive one quarter of the proceeds.\r\nA third official, the Landdrost of Pretoria, admitted that he had\r\nreceived £300 for his 'influence' in furthering the application;\r\nyet no notice had been taken by the Government of their scandalous\r\nconduct, and sad to say the judges who heard the case did not think\r\nit their duty to comment strongly upon the matter. I have in my\r\npossession now a notarial deed which proves that the Railway\r\nCommissioner, the Landdrost, and the Commandant of Pretoria are\r\nmembers of a syndicate whose avowed object is, or was, to wrest from\r\nthe companies their right to the 'bewaarplaatsen.' This shows what\r\nis going on, and what is the measure of safety of title to property.\r\nThose who should guard our rights are our worst enemies. In a law\r\nintroduced by the present Government, the Government, instead of the\r\nCourts, are the final judges in cases of disputed elections. No\r\nElection Committees are allowed. This operates against candidates\r\nopposed to the Government, because the Government has virtually a\r\nvast standing army of committee men, henchmen, officials being\r\nallowed openly to take part in swaying elections, and the Government\r\nbeing in a position, by the distribution of contracts, appointments,\r\npurchase of concessions, the expenditure of Secret Service money and\r\notherwise, to bring into existence and maintain a large number of\r\nsupporters who act as canvassers always on the right side in times\r\nof elections.\r\n\r\nNATIVE AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\nThe administration of native affairs is a gross scandal and a source\r\nof immense loss and danger to the community. Native Commissioners\r\nhave been permitted to practise extortion, injustice, and cruelty\r\nupon the natives under their jurisdiction. The Government has allowed\r\npetty tribes to be goaded into rebellion. We have had to pay the\r\ncosts of the 'wars,' while the wretched victims of their policy have\r\nhad their tribes broken up, sources of native labour have been\r\ndestroyed, and large numbers of prisoners have been kept in goal\r\nfor something like eighteen months without trial. It was stated\r\nin the newspapers that, out of 63 men imprisoned, 31 had died in\r\nthat period, while the rest were languishing to death for want of\r\nvegetable food. We have had revelations of repulsive cruelty on the\r\npart of field-cornets. We all remember the Rachman case, and the\r\nApril case, in which the judges found field-cornets guilty of brutal\r\nconduct to unfortunate natives; but the worst features about these\r\ncases is that the Government has set the seal of its approval upon\r\nthe acts of these officials by paying the costs of the actions out\r\nof public funds, and the President of the State a few days ago made\r\nthe astounding statement in regard to the April case, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the judgment of the High Court, the Government\r\nthought that Prinsloo was right in his action, and therefore paid\r\nthe costs. The Government is enforcing the 'plakkerswet,' which\r\nforbids the locating of more than five families on one farm. The\r\nfield-cornets in various districts have recently broken up homes of\r\nlarge numbers of natives settled on 'Uitlanders'' lands, just at the\r\ntime when they had sown their crops to provide the next winter's\r\nfood. The application of this law is most uneven, as large numbers\r\nof natives are left on the farms of the Boers. Quite recently a\r\nwell-known citizen brought into the country at great expense some\r\nhundreds of families, provided them with land, helped them to start\r\nlife, stipulating only that he should be able to draw from amongst\r\nthem labour at a fair wage to develop his properties. Scarcely had\r\nthey been settled when the field-cornet came down and scattered the\r\npeople, distributing them among Boer farms. The sources of the native\r\nlabour supply have been seriously interfered with at the borders by\r\nGovernment measures, and difficulties have been placed in the way of\r\ntransport of natives by railway to the mines. These things are all a\r\ndrain upon us as a State, and many of them are a burning disgrace to\r\nus as a people.\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATION SCANDAL.\r\n\r\nThe great public that subscribes the bulk of the revenue is virtually\r\ndenied all benefit of State aid in education. There has been a\r\ndeliberate attempt to Hollanderise the Republic, and to kill the\r\nEnglish language. Thousands of children are growing up in this land\r\nin ignorance, unfitted to run the race of life, and there is the\r\npossibility that a large number of them will develop into criminals.\r\nWe have had to tax ourselves privately to guard against these\r\ndangers, and the iniquity of denying education to the children of\r\nmen who are paying taxes is so manifest that I pass on with mingled\r\nfeelings of anger and disgust.\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS.\r\n\r\nThis important branch of the public service is entirely in the hands\r\nof a corporation domiciled in Holland. This corporation holds a\r\nconcession, of course under which not only was there no adequate\r\ncontrol over expenditure in construction, but it is entitled to\r\ncharge and is charging us outrageous tariffs. How outrageous these\r\nare will be seen from the admission made by Mr. Middelberg that the\r\nshort section of 10 miles between Boksburg and Krugersdorp is paying\r\nmore than the interest on the cost of the construction of the whole\r\nline of railway to Delagoa Bay. To add these to its general revenue,\r\nof which 10 per cent, is set aside as a sinking fund, and then to\r\ntake for itself 15 per cent. of the balance, the Company reports\r\nannually to the Raad from Amsterdam in a language which is\r\npractically foreign to it, and makes up its accounts in guelders, a\r\ncoinage which our legislators I venture to say know nothing of; and\r\nthis is independence. We are liable as guarantors for the whole of\r\nthe debt. Lines have been built entirely on our credit, and yet we\r\nhave no say and no control over these important public works beyond\r\nthe show of control which is supposed to be exercised by the present\r\nRailway Commissioner. The Company in conjunction with the Executive\r\nGovernment is in a position to control our destinies to an enormous\r\nextent, to influence our relations internally and externally, to\r\nbring about such friction with the neighbouring States as to set the\r\nwhole of South Africa in tumult. Petitions have been presented to the\r\nRaad, but the President has constantly brushed these aside with the\r\nwell-worn argument that the independence of the State is involved in\r\nthe matter. It is involved in the matter, as all who remember the\r\nrecent Drifts question will admit. I have been told that it is\r\ndangerous for the country to take over the railway, because it would\r\nafford such an immense field for corruption. Surely this is the\r\nstrongest condemnation of the Government by its friends, for if it is\r\nnot fit to run a railway, how can it be fit to manage a whole State?\r\nThe powers controlling this railway are flooding the public service\r\nwith Hollanders to the exclusion of our own people, and I may here\r\nsay that in the most important departments of the State we are being\r\ncontrolled by the gentlemen from the Low Country. While the innocent\r\nBoer hugs to himself the delusion that he is preserving his\r\nindependence, they control us politically through Dr. Leyds,\r\nfinancially through the Netherlands Railway, educationally through\r\nDr. Mansvelt, and in the Department of Justice through Dr. Coster.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS AND TRADE.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Government in regard to taxation may be practically\r\ndescribed as protection without production. The most monstrous\r\nhardships result to consumers, and merchants can scarcely say from\r\nday to day where they are. Twice now has the Government entered into\r\ncompetition with traders who have paid their licences and rents and\r\nwho keep staffs. Recently grain became scarce. The Government\r\nwere petitioned to suspend the duties, which are cruelly high, in\r\norder to assist the mining industry to feed its labourers. The\r\nGovernment refused this request on the plea that it was not in a\r\nposition to suspend duties without the permission of the Volksraad,\r\nand yet within a few days we find that the Government has granted a\r\nconcession to one of its friends to import grain free of duty and to\r\nsell it in competition with the merchants who have had to pay duties.\r\nI do not attempt to deal with this important question adequately, but\r\ngive this example to show how the Government regards the rights of\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nMONOPOLIES.\r\n\r\nIt has been the steady policy of the Government to grant concessions.\r\nNo sooner does any commodity become absolutely essential to the\r\ncommunity than some harpy endeavours to get a concession for its\r\nsupply. There is scarcely a commodity or a right which has not been\r\nmade the subject of an application for the grant of a concession. We\r\nall remember the bread and jam concession, the water concession, the\r\nelectric lighting concession, and many others, but I need only point\r\nto the dynamite concession to show how these monopolies tend to\r\nparalyse our industries. There may be some of you who have not yet\r\nheard and some who have forgotten the facts connected with this\r\noutrage upon public rights.\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE DYNAMITE CONCESSION.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, Mr. Lippert got a concession for the sole right to\r\nmanufacture and sell dynamite and all other explosives. He was to\r\nmanufacture the dynamite in this country. For years he imported\r\ndynamite under the name of Guhr Impregne duty free. He never\r\nmanufactured dynamite in the country, and upon public exposure, the\r\nGovernment was compelled to cancel the concession, the President\r\nhimself denouncing the action of the concessionnaire as fraudulent.\r\nFor a time we breathed freely, thinking we were rid of this incubus,\r\nbut within a few months the Government granted virtually to the same\r\npeople another concession, under which they are now taking from the\r\npockets of the public £600,000 per annum, and this is a charge which\r\nwill go on growing should the mining industry survive the persistent\r\nattempts to strangle it. How a body charged with the public interests\r\ncould be parties to this scandalous fleecing of the public passes\r\ncomprehension. Then, the curious feature about the matter is that the\r\nGovernment gets some petty fraction of this vast sum, and the\r\nconcessionnaires have on this plea obtained enormous advances of\r\npublic moneys from the Government, without security, to carry on\r\ntheir trade. Shortly, the concessionnaires are entitled to charge\r\n90s. a case for dynamite, while it could be bought if there were no\r\nconcession for about 30s. a case. It may be stated incidentally, that\r\nMr. Wolmarans, a member of the Government, has been for years\r\nchallenged to deny that he is enjoying a royalty of 2s. on every case\r\nof dynamite sold, and that he has up to the present moment neglected\r\nto take up the challenge. Proper municipal government is denied to\r\nus, and we all know how much this means with regard to health,\r\ncomfort, and the value of property. The Statute Books are disfigured\r\nwith enactments imposing religious disabilities; and the English\r\nlanguage, the language spoken by the great bulk of the people, is\r\ndenied all official recognition. The natural result of the existing\r\ncondition of things is that the true owners of the mines are those\r\nwho have invested no capital in them--the Government, the railway\r\nconcessionnaires, the dynamite concessionnaires, and others. The\r\ncountry is rich, and under proper government could be developed\r\nmarvellously, but it cannot stand the drain of the present exactions.\r\nWe have lived largely upon foreign capital, and the total amount of\r\nthe dividends available for shareholders in companies is ridiculously\r\nsmall as compared with the aggregate amount of capital invested in\r\nmining ventures. Some day the inevitable result upon our credit and\r\nupon our trade will be forced upon us.\r\n\r\nHATRED OF THE SAXON.\r\n\r\nThere is no disguising the fact that the original policy of the\r\nGovernment is based upon intense hostility to the English-speaking\r\npopulation, and that even against the enfranchised burgher of this\r\nState there is the determination to retain all power in the hands of\r\nthose who are enjoying the sweets of office now, and naturally the\r\ngrateful crowd of relations and friends and henchmen ardently support\r\nthe existing _régime_; but there are unmistakable signs, and the\r\nPresident fears that the policy which he has hitherto adopted will\r\nnot be sufficient to keep in check the growing population. It seems\r\nthe set purpose of the Government to repress the growth of the\r\nindustry, to tax it at every turn, to prevent the working classes\r\nfrom settling here and making their homes and surrounding themselves\r\nwith their families, and there is no mistaking the significance of\r\nthe action of the President when he opposed the throwing open of the\r\ntown lands of Pretoria on the ground that 'he might have a second\r\nJohannesburg there,' nor that of his speech upon the motion for the\r\nemployment of diamond drills to prospect Government lands, which he\r\nopposed hotly on the ground that 'there is too much gold here\r\nalready.'\r\n\r\nTHE POLICY OF FORCE.\r\n\r\nWe now have openly the policy of force revealed to us. £250,000 is to\r\nbe spent upon the completing of a fort at Pretoria, £100,000 is to be\r\nspend upon a fort to terrorize the inhabitants of Johannesburg, large\r\norders are sent to Krupp's for big guns, Maxims have been ordered,\r\nand we are even told that German officers are coming out to drill the\r\nburghers. Are these things necessary or are they calculated to\r\nirritate the feeling to breaking point? What necessity is there for\r\nforts in peaceful inland towns? Why should the Government endeavour\r\nto keep us in subjection to unjust laws by the power of the sword\r\ninstead of making themselves live in the heart of the people by a\r\nbroad policy of justice? What can be said of a policy which\r\ndeliberately divides the two great sections of the people from each\r\nother, instead of uniting them under equal laws, or the policy which\r\nkeeps us in eternal turmoil with the neighbouring States? What shall\r\nbe said of the statecraft, every act of which sows torments,\r\ndiscontent, or race hatred, and reveals a conception of republicanism\r\nunder which the only privilege of the majority of the people is to\r\nprovide the revenue, and to bear insult, while only those are\r\nconsidered Republicans who speak a certain language, and in greater\r\nor less degree share the prejudices of the ruling classes?\r\n\r\nA STIRRING PERORATION.\r\n\r\nI think this policy can never succeed, unless men are absolutely\r\nbereft of every quality which made their forefathers free men; unless\r\nwe have fallen so low that we are prepared to forget honour,\r\nself-respect, and our duty to our children. Once more, I wish to\r\nstate again in unmistakable language what has been so frequently\r\nstated in perfect sincerity before, that we desire an independent\r\nrepublic which shall be a true republic, in which every man who is\r\nprepared to take the oath of allegiance to the State shall have equal\r\nrights, in which our children shall be brought up side by side as\r\nunited members of a strong commonwealth; that we are animated by no\r\nrace hatred, that we desire to deprive no man, be his nationality\r\nwhat it may, of any right.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARTER OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\nWe have now only two questions to consider: _(a)_ What do we want?\r\n_(b)_ how shall we get it? I have stated plainly what our grievances\r\nare, and I shall answer with equal directness the question, 'What do\r\nwe want?' We want: (1) the establishment of this Republic as a true\r\nRepublic; (2) a Grondwet or Constitution which shall be framed by\r\ncompetent persons selected by representatives of the whole people and\r\nframed on lines laid down by them--a Constitution which shall be\r\nsafe-guarded against hasty alteration; (3) an equitable franchise\r\nlaw, and fair representation; (4) equality of the Dutch and English\r\nlanguages; (5) responsibility of the Legislature to the heads of\r\nthe great departments; (6) removal of religious disabilities; (7)\r\nindependence of the courts of justice, with adequate and secured\r\nremuneration of the judges; (8) liberal and comprehensive education;\r\n(9) efficient civil service, with adequate provision for pay and\r\npension; (10) free trade in South African products. That is what we\r\nwant. There now remains the question which is to be put before you at\r\nthe meeting of the 6th January, viz., How shall we get it? To this\r\nquestion I shall expect from you an answer in plain terms according\r\nto your deliberate judgment.\r\n\r\n  CHARLES LEONARD,\r\n  _Chairman of the Transvaal National Union._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE CHIEFTAINESS TOEREMETSJANI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the reports which have appeared the case or cases of Toeremetsjani\r\n_v_. P.A. Cronjé, Jesaja _v_. P.A. Cronjé and D.J. Schoeman, Segole\r\n_v_. P.A. Cronjé and J.A. Erasmus, have attracted, as well they\r\nmight, a good deal of attention. The following _résumé_ and\r\ncommentary were compiled by a legal gentleman who was present during\r\nthe trial, but not professionally employed in it.\r\n\r\nThe facts revealed in the evidence (writes our correspondent) speak\r\npretty well for themselves, but they were brought out into lurid\r\nprominence in the cross-examination of Commandant Cronjé by Mr.\r\nJustice Jorissen. In order to make the case quite clear, it is as\r\nwell to state for the benefit of those who are not intimately\r\nacquainted with things in the Transvaal that this Mr. Cronjé, who\r\nis now the Superintendent-General of Natives, is the same Cronjé\r\nconcerning whose action in regard to Jameson's surrender there was so\r\nmuch discussion. After the Jameson Raid, President Kruger, pursuing\r\nhis policy of packing the Executive with his own friends, decided to\r\nput Cronjé upon the Executive, for which purpose he induced General\r\nJoubert to resign his position as Superintendent-General of Natives.\r\nThe President's intention becoming known to Raad members, the\r\nstrongest possible objection was expressed to this course as being\r\nwholly unconstitutional and in direct conflict with the Grondwet; the\r\nPresident in the first place having no right to add to the number of\r\nExecutive members and no authority for appointing any person to fill\r\na vacancy if there were one. Notice of motion was promptly given in\r\nthe Raad to instruct the Executive not to take the proposed course,\r\nas the Raad felt that the privilege and power of appointing members\r\non the Executive rested with them alone. Twenty-four hours' notice\r\nwas requisite to bring a matter up for discussion before the Raad.\r\nPresident Kruger hearing that notice had been given promptly called a\r\nmeeting of the Executive and appointed Mr. Cronjé in defiance of the\r\nnotice of motion, so that when the motion came on for discussion on\r\nthe following day he replied to the Raad's instruction that it was\r\ntoo late to discuss the matter, the appointment having been made. Mr.\r\nCronjé, therefore, appears on the scene on this occasion without much\r\nto prejudice the unbiassed reader in his favour. The circumstances of\r\nthe surrender of the Potchefstroom garrison, which was secured by\r\ntreacherously suppressing the news of the armistice between the two\r\nforces (a treachery for which public reparation was afterwards\r\nexacted by Sir Evelyn Wood), the treatment of certain prisoners of\r\nwar (compelled to work for the Boers exposed to the fire and being\r\nshot down by their own friends in the garrison), the summary\r\nexecution of other prisoners, the refusal to allow certain of the\r\nwomen to leave the British garrison, resulting in the death of at\r\nleast one, are matters which although sixteen years old are quite\r\nfresh in the memory of the people in the Transvaal. The condition of\r\nDr. Jameson's surrender revived the feeling that Mr. Cronjé has need\r\nto do something remarkable in another direction in order to encourage\r\nthat confidence in him as an impartial and fair-minded man which his\r\npast career unfortunately does not warrant. Commandant Trichard,\r\nmentioned in this connection as a witness, was one of the commandants\r\nwho refused to confirm the terms accorded by Cronjé to Jameson. Mr.\r\nAbel Erasmus is a gentleman so notorious that it would be quite\r\nunnecessary to further describe him. He is the one whom Lord Wolseley\r\ndescribed as a fiend in human form, and threatened to \"hang as high\r\nas Haman.\" Abel Erasmus is the man who had desolated the Lydenburg\r\ndistrict; the hero of the cave affair in which men, women, and\r\nchildren were closed up in a cave and burnt to death or suffocated; a\r\nman who is the living terror of a whole countryside, the mere mention\r\nof whose name is sufficient to cow any native. Mr. Schoeman is the\r\nunderstudy of Abel Erasmus, and is the hero of the satchel case, in\r\nwhich an unfortunate native was flogged well-nigh to death and\r\ntortured in order to wring evidence from him who, it was afterwards\r\ndiscovered, knew absolutely nothing about the affair. The Queen, or\r\nChieftainess, Toeremetsjani, is the present head of the Secocoeni\r\ntribe and the head wife of the late chief, Secocoeni. This tribe, it\r\nwill be remembered, was the one which successfully resisted the Boers\r\nunder President Burger and Commandant Paul Kruger--a successful\r\nresistance which was one of the troubles leading directly to the\r\nabortive annexation of the Transvaal. The Secocoeni tribe were\r\nafterwards conquered by British troops, and handed over to the tender\r\nmercies of the Boer Government upon the restoration of its\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to bear these facts in mind in order to realise the\r\nhideous significance of the unvarnished tale.\r\n\r\nNow to the trial.\r\n\r\nMr. Advocate WESSELS, who acted for the natives, gauging pretty\r\naccurately what the defence would be, called two witnesses to prove\r\nthe _prima facie_ case. Jesaja, one of the indunas flogged, whose\r\ncase was first on the roll, proved that he was flogged by order of\r\nCommandant Cronjé without any form of trial, and without any charge\r\nor indictment being made against him, and that he received twenty-six\r\nlashes, the extra one being given because he declined to say 'Thank\r\nyou' for the twenty-five. Commandant Trichard next gave evidence, and\r\nfrom him Mr. WESSELS elicited that Cronjé had gone through no form of\r\ntrial, but handed over Jesaja and the other twelve indunas to be\r\nflogged by Erasmus and Schoeman.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: Do you positively swear that Commandant Cronjé specified\r\nthe sentence of twenty-five lashes each?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nWhich answer was quite in accordance with the pleas of Erasmus and\r\nSchoeman, who stated specifically that they administered the lashes\r\nin accordance with the orders and sentence given by Commandant\r\nCronjé. The Court held that a sufficient _prima facie_ case had been\r\nmade out by the plaintiff, and that the onus now lay on the\r\ndefendants to prove their case. The witnesses called were Commandant\r\nCronjé and Mr. Stiemens, secretary to the former. Mr. Stiemens in his\r\nevidence fully corroborated Trichard's evidence as to the passing of\r\nthe sentence by Cronjé upon the indunas and the absence of any\r\nform of trial; and nothing more need be said about this witness. With\r\nMr. Cronjé's evidence, however, it is necessary to deal at length.\r\nMr. Cronjé admitted under cross-examination that he had not observed\r\nany particular form of trial, although, as was pointed out, the law\r\ndealing with native trials stated specifically 'that the rules which\r\ngovern procedure in civilized courts shall be followed as closely as\r\npossible.' He stated that as regards the Chieftainess, he called her\r\nup and read over to her 'point by point' 'the indictment under\r\nwhich she was charged,' which indictment, however, as he admitted,\r\nconsisted merely of a letter of complaint written by Field-cornet\r\nSchoeman to him as Superintendent-General of Natives. He claimed\r\nthat no form of trial was necessary, inasmuch as he acted under the\r\nauthority of the President, who has supreme power over natives, and\r\nwas not obliged to observe any particular form of trial. 'Point by\r\npoint I read the charge,' to use his own words, 'against the woman,\r\nand point by point I could see by her demeanour that she was guilty.'\r\nAs regards the thirteen indunas, Mr. Cronjé admitted that he did not\r\nknow whether these were indunas. He considered them guilty, not\r\nbecause they had done anything, but because in their position as\r\nadvisers of the Chieftainess they ought to have advised her better\r\nthan they appeared to have done. Instructions had therefore been\r\ngiven to arrest these indunas, and they had caught as many as they\r\ncould. There was no evidence to show that they were indunas, or that\r\nthey were ever in a position to advise or had advised the\r\nChieftainess; in fact, it was admitted that they were a lot of\r\nthirteen caught out of a tribe as one might catch so many sheep out\r\nof a flock. Mr. Cronjé denied that he had sentenced these men, and\r\nrepeatedly stated that he had handed them over to Erasmus and\r\nSchoeman, to be dealt with according to law.\r\n\r\nMr. WESSELS cross-examined the witness upon this point as follows:--\r\n\r\nAdvocate: I believe Commandant Trichard accompanied you on this\r\ncommission?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: He was present throughout the whole proceeding?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: He had every opportunity of knowing what took place and\r\nwhat was said?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: You will be surprised to hear that Mr. Trichard states that\r\nyou actually passed sentence upon the thirteen indunas in such words\r\nas, 'I hand you over to the Native Commissioner and Field-cornet to\r\nbe dealt with according to law. And you instigators will get\r\ntwenty-five lashes each between the shoulders.' Do you positively\r\ndeny that you said anything about twenty-five lashes?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes, I deny it.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: Do you deny that you gave any indication or opinion as to\r\nwhat ought to be done with these men?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: Well, Mr. Cronjé, I want to know which of you two the Court\r\nis to believe, you or Commandant Trichard?\r\n\r\nWitness: Commandant Trichard has made a mistake.\r\n\r\nAdvocate: No, no, no, Mr. Cronjé, that won't do; there are no\r\nmistakes in this business. I want you to tell the Court which of you\r\ntwo men under oath is lying and which is telling the truth.\r\n\r\nWitness: Commandant Trichard is lying.\r\n\r\n(At this point there was some commotion in Court caused by Commandant\r\nTrichard jumping up and making use of some expressions towards the\r\nwitness. The matter ended in a rather fierce altercation after the\r\nCourt adjourned.) It is only necessary to add that Mr. Stiemans, who\r\nfollowed Cronjé, fully corroborated Trichard's evidence. There were\r\nmany other interesting points brought out by Mr. WESSELS in his\r\ncross-examination, but it is unnecessary to further detail this part\r\nof the proceedings, as the same ground was covered by Mr. Justice\r\nJorissen, who took the witness in hand and whose cross-examination\r\nbrought out the salient features of the case with extreme vividness\r\nand dramatic effect. The Judge first dealt with that portion of the\r\nevidence relating to the so-called 'trial' of the Chieftainess.\r\n\r\nJudge: Mr. Cronjé, in your evidence just now you said that you read\r\nover to this woman the charge that was laid against her. 'Point by\r\npoint' you say you read it to her, and 'point by point you could see\r\nby her demeanour that she was guilty.' Is that so?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: Very well, Mr. Cronjé, I will take the indictment, 'point by\r\npoint,' as you did. Point the first, Mr. Cronjé. (The Judge here read\r\nthe first of the seven clauses in Schoeman's letter which formed the\r\nindictment.) Now kindly explain to me what there was in the woman's\r\ndemeanour which conveyed to you the idea that she was guilty on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe witness became considerably embarrassed and did not answer.\r\n\r\nJudge: No answer, Mr. Cronjé? Well, we will take point No. 2. (The\r\njudge dealt with all the seven clauses in a similar manner, the\r\nwitness failing to make any answer throughout. After the last point\r\nhad been dealt with and remained unanswered, the Judge addressed the\r\nwitness again amid a most impressive silence in Court).\r\n\r\nJudge: Mr. Cronjé, 'point by point' I have read to you the indictment\r\nas you read it to the woman; 'point by point' I have asked you to\r\ngive me certain information; 'point by point' you have failed to make\r\nany answer. Well, Mr. Cronjé, I can only tell you this, 'point by\r\npoint' I shall set that down in my notes. (After an interval, during\r\nwhich the Judge filled in his notes, the examination was resumed.)\r\n\r\nJudge: Now, Mr. Cronjé, as I understand it, it was in consequence of\r\nField-cornet Schoeman's complaint to you as Superintendent-General of\r\nNatives that you were sent by the Government to investigate the\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: You called the woman up before you and read to her the\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: You brought no evidence against her?\r\n\r\nWitness: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: You did not call upon Schoeman to produce any evidence against\r\nher?\r\n\r\nWitness: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: His letter of complaint to you seemed sufficient?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes.\r\n\r\nJudge: You did not give her any opportunity to bring evidence?\r\n\r\nWitness: It was not necessary.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh, dear no; I quite understand that 'you could tell from her\r\ndemeanour that she was guilty.' But as a matter of form you did not\r\nhear any evidence on her behalf?\r\n\r\nWitness: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: You just sentenced her out of hand.\r\n\r\nWitness: I sentenced her to pay a fine.\r\n\r\nJudge: And then as regards the thirteen indunas, if they were\r\nindunas, as you deny sentencing them we need not refer further to\r\nthat point, but I put this to you--there was no evidence brought\r\nagainst them?\r\n\r\nWitness: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: There was nothing to show that these men had ever advised the\r\nwoman or were in a position to advise her; in fact, as far as the\r\nevidence goes, there was nothing to show that they even belonged to\r\nthe tribe, but in your opinion they ought to have advised her\r\ndifferently, and you therefore sentenced them to twenty-five lashes\r\neach.\r\n\r\nWitness: I did not sentence them, but handed them over to the proper\r\nauthorities to be dealt with according to law.\r\n\r\nJudge: Oh, no, Mr. Cronjé, that is not how the case appears to me.\r\nYou came up to these people in the capacity of Judge, to do justice\r\nas between man and man according to your lights, to follow the\r\nprocedure that is observed in civilized courts, to represent the\r\nstrength, the rights, and the responsibilities of this Republic, and\r\nif we are to accept your evidence as true, you did not try the men\r\nwhom you were to have tried. You heard evidence neither for nor\r\nagainst them, but you handed them over to--to whom, Mr. Cronjé? Not\r\nto the proper authorities, but to Erasmus and Schoeman, the other\r\nparties in the case which you were sent up to try. It seems to me,\r\nMr. Cronjé, that this is a case without parallel.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer from the witness.\r\n\r\nJudge: One point more, Mr. Cronjé, and I have finished. When you\r\nhanded over these men to be dealt with, did you notify them that they\r\nhad the right of appeal from any sentence that might be imposed upon\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nWitness: Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nJudge: Right! Now, Mr. Cronjé, did you notify Erasmus and Schoeman\r\nthat they should stay execution of the sentence pending the hearing\r\nof any appeal?\r\n\r\nAfter considerable pause the witness was understood to say \"No.\"\r\n\r\nJudge: You did not tell these officials to stay execution?\r\n\r\nWitness: No.\r\n\r\nJudge: Then you merely gave these natives the right to appeal against\r\nthe sentence of lashes after they should have received the lashes?\r\n\r\nThere was no answer from the witness.\r\n\r\nJudge: That will do, Mr. Cronjé. I do not think that these people\r\nhave much reason to thank you for the leave to appeal.\r\n\r\nCronjé was followed in the witness-box by Stiemens, whose evidence is\r\nalready referred to, and the Court then adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, shortly before the opening of the Court, the State\r\nAttorney came down on behalf of the Government and arranged with\r\nPlaintiffs' Counsel to adjourn for the day to enable parties to try\r\nand settle the three cases out of Court. The Court thereupon\r\nadjourned at the request of parties, and during the day the three\r\ncases were settled on the following basis: The Government refunds\r\nToeremetsjani the £147 10s. with interest at 6 per cent, from the\r\ndate of payment by her to Erasmus, and pays her costs, to be taxed as\r\nbetween attorney and client.\r\n\r\nThe Defendants Cronjé, Erasmus, and Schoeman, pay each of the\r\nthirteen indunas who were flogged £25 as compensation, and pay the\r\ncosts of Jesaja and Segole, to be taxed as between attorney and\r\nclient.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nOne last touch of irony is needed to complete the story of the suits\r\nbrought by the Chieftainess Toeremetsjani and her indunas against\r\nMessrs. Erasmus, Schoeman, and the rest. It seems that these same\r\ngentlemen have actually been appointed by the Government to\r\n'investigate matters' in the district where these Kaffirs live. Poor\r\nToeremetsjani and the unfortunate indunas, as a contemporary remarks,\r\nmay be expected to give a grovelling welcome. No more High Court for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe natives, by the way, interviewed since their return to the\r\nkraals, state that they have not yet received the settlement\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the above sample of justice to the natives it is\r\nas well to recall another recent incident which has lately taken\r\nplace. Some natives being severely mishandled by the local\r\nauthorities, and being in consequence destitute of means to proceed\r\nagainst them in law, applied to Court for leave to sue _in forma\r\npauperis_. This leave was granted. Immediately upon this becoming\r\nknown petitions were got up among the Boers, with the result that the\r\nVolksraad some six weeks ago took a resolution instructing the\r\nGovernment to immediately bring in a law forbidding the judges to\r\ngrant such leave, and making it impossible for a native to sue\r\nGovernment or any white person _in forma pauperis_. Comment\r\n(concludes the correspondent who sets out these various facts) is\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX L.\r\n\r\n  59, HOLBORN VIADUCT, LONDON, E.C.\r\n       _6th May, 1897._\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE LETTER WRITTEN ON A TORN TELEGRAM FORM SIGNED \"F.R.\",\r\nBY MR. T.H. GURRIN, EXPERT IN HANDWRITING.\r\n\r\nMr. THOMAS HENRY GURRIN, of 59, Holborn Viaduct, London, E.C., is a\r\nprofessional expert in handwriting, recognized and employed by the\r\nDirector of Public Prosecutions, the Home Office, and the authorities\r\nat Scotland Yard, and is constantly engaged by them in that capacity.\r\nHe is also frequently engaged in the same capacity by the Bank of\r\nEngland and other public bodies.\r\n\r\nHe has acted as handwriting expert in a very large number of civil\r\nand criminal cases at sessions, assizes, and before the High Courts,\r\nfor over twelve years past, and can conscientiously say that his\r\nexperience in the identification of genuine handwriting and the\r\ndetection of forged and altered documents is very extensive.\r\n\r\nMr. Gurrin begs respectfully to submit the following report:--\r\n\r\n'Having been instructed by Mr. Braunstein, solicitor, of 27, Great\r\nGeorge Street, Westminster, I have examined a photograph of torn\r\nportions of a letter written on a telegram form of the South African\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n'My attention has been directed to the evidence of Major Sir J.C.\r\nWilloughby, appearing at page 302 of the Minutes, in which he has\r\ngiven his version of the missing portions of this document.\r\n\r\n'I have compared this version of the missing words with the vacant\r\nspaces, and I find that the words supplied in question 5,571 would\r\noccupy, as near as can be estimated, the missing spaces, judging from\r\nthe other writing in the document.\r\n\r\n'I read the first portion of the document as follows:--\r\n\r\n  '\"Dear Dr.,\r\n       \"The rumour of massacre in\"\r\n   \"Johannesburg that started you to our\"\r\n   \"relief was not true. We are all right;\"\r\n   \"feeling intense; we have armed\"\r\n   \"a lot of men. Shall (not 'I shall') be very glad\"\r\n   \"to see you. We are not in possession of\"\r\n   \"town.\"\r\n\r\n'Major Sir J.C. Willoughby reads line 6, \"We (or the Boers).\" It\r\ncannot possibly be \"the Boers,\" as the first letter is clearly a\r\nportion of a capital \"W,\" and corresponds with the first portion of\r\nthe \"W\" as made at line 3; and further, there would be no room for\r\nthe two words \"the Boers,\" between the portion of the letter \"W\" and\r\nthe word \"not.\"\r\n\r\n'Again, I am of opinion that the last word in line 6 was \"of,\" as\r\nthere is still visible an ascending curved stroke corresponding to\r\nthat with which the writer terminates the letter \"f.\"\r\n\r\n'With reference to the rest of the version as contained in question\r\n5,573, I respectfully submit that the missing words supplied are\r\nabsolutely inconsistent with the spaces which these words would\r\noccupy if written naturally by the same writer.\r\n\r\n'The words \"I will bring at least three hundred\" do not correspond\r\nwith the still existing marks on line 7. The portion of a letter\r\nappearing in the middle of the line would not, as far as I can judge,\r\nbe a part of any of the words suggested which would come at the\r\ncentre of that line. It might be a part of a capital \"W,\" or an\r\ninitial \"p,\" or it might be a final \"d\" turned back to the left, and\r\nthe last letter in the line looks as though it was intended for an\r\n\"e.\" In support of this theory, I compare it with the \"e\" at the end\r\nof the word \"true\" in line 3, and the \"e\" at the end of \"intense,\"\r\nline 4. The writer, when making a final \"d,\" makes the latter\r\nportion of the letter something like this, but in the instances in\r\nthis document he exerts more pressure than we find here, see, for\r\ninstance, the \"d\" in \"started,\" at line 2, the \"d\" in \"glad,\" in\r\nline 5, and \"d\" in \"armed,\" line 4. Besides, I cannot think that this\r\ncan be the end of the word \"hundred,\" as, judging from the length of\r\nthe word \"started,\" the word \"hundred\" would have occupied from the\r\nthird vertical line, and this would certainly leave no room for\r\nthe other words suggested in the version given by Major Sir J.C.\r\nWilloughby, viz.: \"We will bring at least, or about three.\" If the\r\nwords \"will send out some,\" or \"we will send out some,\" are written\r\nin line 7 after the word \"town,\" adopting, as nearly as possible, the\r\nspace that would have been occupied by the writer for these words,\r\nthey will just fill the line. In like manner, with regard to line 8,\r\nthere is just room after the words \"men to\" for the two words \"meet\r\nyou,\" and the small mark appearing before the full stop might\r\nhave been the terminal of the letter \"u,\" but it would have been\r\nimpossible to get into this small space the words \"meet you at\r\nKrugersdorp,\" and even if the words \"meet you at\" were omitted, and\r\nif it be assumed that the word which originally stood there was\r\n\"Krugersdorp,\" then the mark appearing before the full stop could\r\nnot by any theory be construed as having been a portion of the\r\nletter \"p,\" as I have examined various specimens of Colonel Rhodes'\r\nhandwriting, and have seen him write specimens containing the letter\r\n\"p\" and find that he does not terminate a \"p\" with any stroke of this\r\ndescription, but that he terminates it inside the oval portion of the\r\nletter near the downstroke. With regard to the rest of the line, the\r\nlast two letters appear to have been \"ne,\" and there is a dot just in\r\nthe position that would apparently have been occupied by the dot had\r\nthe previous letter been \"i.\" Consequently, I am of opinion that the\r\ntheory that the words \"will send,\" or \"we will send out some men to\r\nmeet you,\" \"you are a fine fellow,\" is perfectly consistent with the\r\nspaces left in the torn document, but that the theory that the words\r\nwhich were originally in the spaces were \"I will bring at least or\r\nabout three hundred men to meet you at Krugersdorp, you are a gallant\r\nfellow,\" is not only inconsistent with the amount of space available,\r\nbut does not fit in with the letters and portions of letters still\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'T.H. GURRIN.'\r\n\r\nContents of the letter according to a statement signed by Dr.\r\nJameson, Sir John Willoughby, Major Robert White and Colonel Raleigh\r\nGrey:--\r\n\r\n'The rumour of massacre in Johannesburg that started you to our\r\nrelief was not true. We are all right, feeling intense. We have armed\r\na lot of men. I shall be very glad to see you. We (or the Boers) are\r\nnot in possession of the town. I will bring at least, or about, 300\r\nmen to meet you at Krugersdorp. You are a gallant fellow.'\r\n\r\nAccording to Colonel Francis Rhodes and Mr. Lionel Phillips, the\r\ncontents are as follows:--\r\n\r\n'The rumour of massacre in Johannesburg that started you to our\r\nrelief was not true. We are all right, feeling intense. We have armed\r\na lot of men. Shall be very glad to see you. We are not in possession\r\nof the town. We will send out some men to meet you. You are a fine\r\nfellow.'\r\n\r\n'We, the undersigned, were present in the Reform Committee's room\r\nwhen Colonel Rhodes despatched the letter to Dr. Jameson, which\r\ncommences, \"Dear Dr.--The rumour of massacre.\" We read the letter,\r\nbut cannot now recall the exact words on the missing fragments; but\r\nwe do hereby declare on oath that there was no offer of 300 men, nor\r\nof any other specific number of men, nor was the word Krugersdorp\r\nmentioned. The spirit of the letter was to suggest that a few men\r\nshould or would be sent in the character of a complimentary escort to\r\nshow Dr. Jameson his camp.\r\n\r\n  'GEO. W. FARRAR.\r\n  'S.W. JAMESON.\r\n\r\n  'As witness--\r\n  'J. Percy FitzPatrick.\r\n  'Johannesburg, _10th April, 1897_.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Transvaal from Within, by J. P.
