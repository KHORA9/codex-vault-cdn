It is out of the\r\nquestion, in a book so brief as this must necessarily be, to meet all\r\nthese demands or to alter these points of view. Interests that are\r\npurely local, events that did not with certainty contribute to the final\r\noutcome, gossip, as well as the mere caprice of the scholar--these must\r\nobviously be set aside.\r\n\r\nThe task imposed upon the volume resolves itself, at bottom, into just\r\ntwo questions: Why was there a war? Why was the Lincoln Government\r\nsuccessful? With these two questions always in mind I have endeavored,\r\non the one hand, to select and consolidate the pertinent facts; on the\r\nother, to make clear, even at the cost of explanatory comment, their\r\nrelations in the historical sequence of cause and effect. This purpose\r\nhas particularly governed the use of biographical matter, in which the\r\nmain illustration, of course, is the career of Lincoln. Prominent as it\r\nis here made, the Lincoln matter all bears in the last analysis on one\r\npoint--his control of his support. On that the history of the North\r\nhinges. The personal and private Lincoln it is impossible to present\r\nwithin these pages. The public Lincoln, including the character of his\r\nmind, is here the essential matter.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography at the close of the volume indicates the more important\r\nbooks which are at the reader's disposal and which it is unfortunate not\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL W.

No two\r\nnations upon earth entertain feelings of more bitter rancor toward each\r\nother than these two nations of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark, which is attributed to Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio,\r\nprovides the key to American politics in the decade following the\r\nCompromise of 1850. To trace this division of the people to its ultimate\r\nsource, one would have to go far back into colonial times. There was a\r\nprocess of natural selection at work, in the intellectual and economic\r\nconditions of the eighteenth century, which inevitably drew together\r\ncertain types and generated certain forces. This process manifested\r\nitself in one form in His Majesty's plantations of the North, and in\r\nanother in those of the South. As early as the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the social tendencies of the two regions were already so far\r\nalienated that they involved differences which would scarcely admit of\r\nreconciliation. It is a truism to say that these differences gradually\r\nwere concentrated around fundamentally different conceptions of\r\nlabor--of slave labor in the South, of free labor in the North.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, could be more fallacious than the notion that this\r\ngrowing antagonism was controlled by any deliberate purpose in either\r\npart of the country. It was apparently necessary that this Republic in\r\nits evolution should proceed from confederation to nationality through\r\nan intermediate and apparently reactionary period of sectionalism. In\r\nthis stage of American history, slavery was without doubt one of the\r\nprime factors involved, but sectional consciousness, with all its\r\nemotional and psychological implications, was the fundamental impulse of\r\nthe stern events which occurred between 1850 and 1865.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century the more influential Southerners\r\nhad come generally to regard their section of the country as a distinct\r\nsocial unit. The next step was inevitable. The South began to regard\r\nitself as a separate political unit. It is the distinction of Calhoun\r\nthat he showed himself toward the end sufficiently flexible to become\r\nthe exponent of this new political impulse. With all his earlier fire\r\nhe encouraged the Southerners to withdraw from the so-called national\r\nparties, Whig and Democratic, to establish instead a single Southern\r\nparty, and to formulate, by means of popular conventions, a single\r\nconcerted policy for the entire South.\r\n\r\nAt that time such a policy was still regarded, from the Southern point\r\nof view, as a radical idea. In 1851, a battle was fought at the polls\r\nbetween the two Southern ideas--the old one which upheld separate state\r\nindependence, and the new one which virtually acknowledged Southern\r\nnationality. The issue at stake was the acceptance or the rejection of\r\na compromise which could bring no permanent settlement of fundamental\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nNowhere was the battle more interesting than in South Carolina, for it\r\nbrought into clear light that powerful Southern leader who ten years\r\nlater was to be the masterspirit of secession--Robert Barnwell Rhett. In\r\n1851 he fought hard to revive the older idea of state independence\r\nand to carry South Carolina as a separate state out of the Union.\r\nAccordingly it is significant of the progress that the consolidation\r\nof the South had made at this date that on this issue Rhett encountered\r\ngeneral opposition. This difference of opinion as to policy was not\r\ninspired, as some historians have too hastily concluded, by national\r\nfeeling. Scarcely any of the leaders of the opposition considered the\r\nFederal Government supreme over the State Government. They opposed Rhett\r\nbecause they felt secession to be at that moment bad policy. They saw\r\nthat, if South Carolina went out of the Union in 1851, she would go\r\nalone and the solidarity of the South would be broken. They were not\r\nlacking in sectional patriotism, but their conception of the best\r\nsolution of the complex problem differed from that advocated by Rhett.\r\nTheir position was summed up by Langdon Cheves when he said, \"To secede\r\nnow is to secede from the South as well as from the Union.\" On the basis\r\nof this belief they defeated Rhett and put off secession for ten years.\r\n\r\nThere is no analogous single event in the history of the North,\r\nprevious to the war, which reveals with similar clearness a sectional\r\nconsciousness. On the surface the life of the people seemed, indeed, to\r\nbelie the existence of any such feeling. The Northern capitalist class\r\naimed steadily at being non-sectional, and it made free use of the word\r\nnational. We must not forget, however, that all sorts of people talked\r\nof national institutions, and that the term, until we look closely\r\ninto the mind of, the person using it, signifies nothing. Because the\r\nNorthern capitalist repudiated the idea of sectionalism, it does not\r\nfollow that he set up any other in its place. Instead of accomplishing\r\nanything so positive, he remained for the most part a negative quantity.\r\n\r\nLiving usually somewhere between Maine and Ohio, he made it his chief\r\npurpose to regulate the outflow of manufactures from that industrial\r\nregion and the inflow of agricultural produce. The movement of the\r\nlatter eastward and northward, and the former westward and southward,\r\nrepresents roughly but graphically the movement of the business of that\r\ntime. The Easterner lived in fear of losing the money which was owed him\r\nin the South. As the political and economic conditions of the day made\r\nunlikely any serious clash of interest between the East and the West, he\r\nhad little solicitude about his accounts beyond the Alleghanies. But a\r\ngradually developing hostility between North and South was accompanied\r\nby a parallel anxiety on the part of Northern capital for its Southern\r\ninvestments and debts. When the war eventually became inevitable,\r\n$200,000,000 were owed by Southerners to Northerners. For those days\r\nthis was an indebtedness of no inconsiderable magnitude. The Northern\r\ncapitalists, preoccupied with their desire to secure this account, were\r\nnaturally eager to repudiate sectionalism, and talked about national\r\ninterests with a zeal that has sometimes been misinterpreted. Throughout\r\nthe entire period from 1850 to 1865, capital in American politics played\r\nfor the most part a negative role, and not until after the war did it\r\nbecome independent of its Southern interests.\r\n\r\nFor the real North of that day we must turn to those Northerners who\r\nfelt sufficient unto themselves and whose political convictions were\r\nunbiased by personal interests which were involved in other parts of the\r\ncountry. We must listen to the distinct voices that gave utterance to\r\ntheir views, and we must observe the definite schemes of their political\r\nleaders. Directly we do this, the fact stares us in the face that the\r\nNorth had become a democracy. The rich man no longer played the role\r\nof grandee, for by this time there had arisen those two groups which,\r\nbetween them, are the ruin of aristocracy--the class of prosperous\r\nlaborers and the group of well-to-do intellectuals. Of these, the latter\r\ngave utterance, first, to their faith in democracy, and then, with all\r\nthe intensity of partisan zeal, to their sense of the North as the\r\nagent of democracy. The prosperous laborers applauded this expression\r\nof an opinion in which they thoroughly believed and at the same time gave\r\ntheir willing support to a land policy that was typically Northern.\r\n\r\nAmerican economic history in the middle third of the century is\r\nessentially the record of a struggle to gain possession of public land.\r\nThe opposing forces were the South, which strove to perpetuate by this\r\nmeans a social system that was fundamentally aristocratic, and the\r\nNorth, which sought by the same means to foster its ideal of democracy.\r\nThough the South, with the aid of its economic vassal, the Northern\r\ncapitalist class, was for some time able to check the land-hunger of\r\nthe Northern democrats, it was never able entirely to secure the control\r\nwhich it desired, but was always faced with the steady and continued\r\nopposition of the real North. On one occasion in Congress, the heart\r\nof the whole matter was clearly shown, for at the very moment when the\r\nNortherners of the democratic class were pressing one of their frequent\r\nschemes for free land, Southerners and their sympathetic Northern\r\nhenchmen were furthering a scheme that aimed at the purchase of Cuba.\r\nFrom the impatient sneer of a Southerner that the Northerners sought to\r\ngive \"land to the landless\" and the retort that the Southerners seemed\r\nequally anxious to supply \"niggers to the niggerless,\" it can be seen\r\nthat American history is sometimes better summed up by angry politicians\r\nthan by historians.\r\n\r\nWe must be on our guard, however, against ascribing to either side\r\ntoo precise a consciousness of its own motives. The old days when the\r\nAmerican Civil War was conceived as a clear-cut issue are as a watch in\r\nthe night that has passed, and we now realize that historical movements\r\nare almost without exception the resultants of many motives. We have\r\ncome to recognize that men have always misapprehended themselves,\r\ncontradicted themselves, obeyed primal impulses, and then deluded\r\nthemselves with sophistications upon the springs of action. In a word,\r\nunaware of what they are doing, men allow their aesthetic and dramatic\r\nsenses to shape their conceptions of their own lives.\r\n\r\nThat \"great impersonal artist,\" of whom Matthew Arnold has so much to\r\nsay, is at work in us all, subtly making us into illusions, first to\r\nourselves and later to the historian. It is the business of history, as\r\nof analytic fiction, both to feel the power of these illusions and to\r\nwork through them in imagination to the dim but potent motives on which\r\nthey rest. We are prone to forget that we act from subconscious quite as\r\noften as from conscious influences, from motives that arise out of the\r\ndim parts of our being, from the midst of shadows that psychology has\r\nonly recently begun to lift, where senses subtler than the obvious make\r\nuse of fear, intuition, prejudice, habit, and illusion, and too often\r\nplay with us as the wind with blown leaves.\r\n\r\nTrue as this is of man individually, it is even more fundamentally true\r\nof man collectively, of parties, of peoples. It is a strikingly accurate\r\ndescription of the relation of the two American nations that now found\r\nthemselves opposed within the Republic. Neither fully understood the\r\nother. Each had a social ideal that was deeper laid than any theory of\r\ngovernment or than any commercial or humanitarian interest. Both knew\r\nvaguely but with sure instinct that their interests and ideals\r\nwere irreconcilable. Each felt in its heart the deadly passion of\r\nself-preservation. It was because, in both North and South, men were\r\nsubtly conscious that a whole social system was the issue at stake, and\r\nbecause on each side they believed in their own ideals with their whole\r\nsouls, that, when the time came for their trial by fire, they went to\r\ntheir deaths singing.\r\n\r\nIn the South there still obtained the ancient ideal of territorial\r\naristocracy. Those long traditions of the Western European peoples\r\nwhich had made of the great landholder a petty prince lay beneath the\r\nplantation life of the Southern States. The feudal spirit, revived in a\r\nsofter world and under brighter skies, gave to those who participated in\r\nit the same graces and somewhat the same capacities which it gave to the\r\nknightly class in the days of Roland--courage, frankness, generosity,\r\nability in affairs, a sense of responsibility, the consciousness\r\nof caste. The mode of life which the planters enjoyed and which the\r\ninferior whites regarded as a social paradise was a life of complete\r\ndeliverance from toil, of disinterested participation in local\r\ngovernment, of absolute personal freedom--a life in which the mechanical\r\naction of law was less important than the more human compulsion of\r\nsocial opinion, and in which private differences were settled under the\r\ncode of honor.\r\n\r\nThis Southern life was carried on in the most appropriate environment.\r\nOn a landed estate, often larger than many of Europe's baronies, stood\r\nthe great house of the planter, usually a graceful example of colonial\r\narchitecture, surrounded by stately gardens. This mansion was the center\r\nof a boundless hospitality; guests were always coming and going; the\r\nhostess and her daughters were the very symbols of kindliness and ease.\r\nTo think of such houses was to think of innumerable joyous days;\r\nof gentlemen galloping across country after the hounds; of coaches\r\nlumbering along avenues of noble oaks, bringing handsome women to visit\r\nthe mansion; of great feastings; of nights of music and dancing; above\r\nall, of the great festival of Christmas, celebrated much as had been the\r\ncustom in \"Merrie England\" centuries before.\r\n\r\nBelow the surface of this bright world lay the enslaved black race. In\r\nthe minds of many Southerners--it was always a secret burden from which\r\nthey saw no means of freeing themselves. To emancipate the slaves, and\r\nthereby to create a population of free blacks, was generally considered,\r\nfrom the white point of view, an impossible solution of the problem.\r\nThe Southerners usually believed that the African could be tamed only\r\nin small groups and when constantly surrounded by white influence, as in\r\nthe case of house servants. Though a few great capitalists had taken\r\nup the idea that the deliberate exploitation of the blacks was the high\r\nprerogative of the whites, the general sentiment of the Southern people\r\nwas more truly expressed by Toombs when he said: \"The question is not\r\nwhether we could be more prosperous and happy with these three and a\r\nhalf million slaves in Africa, and their places filled with an equal\r\nnumber of hardy, intelligent, and enterprising citizens of the superior\r\nrace; but it is simply whether, while we have them among us, we would be\r\nmost prosperous with them in freedom or in bondage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern people, in the majority of instances, had no hatred of the\r\nblacks. In the main they led their free, spirited, and gracious life,\r\nconvinced that the maintenance of slavery was but making the best of\r\ncircumstances which were beyond their control. It was these Southern\r\npeople who were to hear from afar the horrible indictment of all\r\ntheir motives by the Abolitionists and who were to react in a growing\r\nbitterness and distrust toward everything Northern.\r\n\r\nBut of these Southern people the average Northerner knew nothing.\r\nHe knew the South only on its least attractive side of professional\r\npolitics. For there was a group of powerful magnates, rich planters or\r\n\"slave barons,\" who easily made their way into Congress, and who played\r\ninto the hands of the Northern capitalists, for a purpose similar to\r\ntheirs. It was these men who forced the issue upon slavery; they warned\r\nthe common people of the North to mind their own business; and for doing\r\nso they were warmly applauded by the Northern capitalist class. It was\r\ntherefore in opposition to the whole American world of organized capital\r\nthat the Northern masses demanded the use of \"the Northern hammer\"--as\r\nSumner put it, in one of his most furious speeches--in their aim to\r\ndestroy a section where, intuitively, they felt their democratic ideal\r\ncould not be realized.\r\n\r\nAnd what was that ideal? Merely to answer democracy is to dodge the\r\nfundamental question. The North was too complex in its social structure\r\nand too multitudinous in its interests to confine itself to one type\r\nof life. It included all sorts and conditions of men--from the most\r\ngracious of scholars who lived in romantic ease among his German and\r\nSpanish books, and whose lovely house in Cambridge is forever associated\r\nwith the noble presence of Washington, to the hardy frontiersman,\r\nbreaking the new soil of his Western claim, whose wife at sunset shaded\r\nher tired eyes, under a hand rough with labor, as she stood on the\r\nthreshold of her log cabin, watching for the return of her man across\r\nthe weedy fields which he had not yet fully subdued. Far apart as were\r\nLongfellow and this toiler of the West, they yet felt themselves to be\r\none in purpose.\r\n\r\nThey were democrats, but not after the simple, elementary manner of the\r\ndemocrats at the opening of the century. In the North, there had come\r\nto life a peculiar phase of idealism that had touched democracy with\r\nmysticism and had added to it a vague but genuine romance. This new\r\nvision of the destiny of the country had the practical effect of making\r\nthe Northerners identify themselves in their imaginations with all\r\nmankind and in creating in them an enthusiastic desire, not only to give\r\nto every American a home of his own, but also to throw open the gates of\r\nthe nation and to share the wealth of America with the poor of all the\r\nworld. In very truth, it was their dominating passion to give \"land to\r\nthe landless.\" Here was the clue to much of their attitude toward the\r\nSouth. Most of these Northern dreamers gave little or no thought to\r\nslavery itself; but they felt that the section which maintained such a\r\nsystem so committed to aristocracy that any real friendship with it was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nWe are thus forced to conceive the American Republic in the years\r\nimmediately following the Compromise of 1850 as, in effect, a dual\r\nnation, without a common loyalty between the two parts. Before long the\r\nmost significant of the great Northerners of the time was to describe\r\nthis impossible condition by the appropriate metaphor of a house\r\ndivided against itself. It was not, however, until eight years after the\r\ndivision of the country had been acknowledged in 1850 that these\r\nwords were uttered. In those eight years both sections awoke to the\r\nseriousness of the differences that they had admitted. Both perceived\r\nthat, instead of solving their problem in 1850, they had merely drawn\r\nsharply the lines of future conflict. In every thoughtful mind there\r\narose the same alternative questions: Is there no solution but fighting\r\nit out until one side destroys the other, or we end as two nations\r\nconfessedly independent? Or is there some conceivable new outlet for\r\nthis opposition of energy on the part of the sections, some new mode of\r\npermanent adjustment?\r\n\r\nIt was at the moment when thinking men were asking these questions that\r\none of the nimblest of politicians took the center of the stage. Stephen\r\nA. Douglas was far-sighted enough to understand the land-hunger of\r\nthe time. One is tempted to add that his ear was to the ground. The\r\nstatement will not, however, go unchallenged, for able apologists have\r\ntheir good word to say for Douglas. Though in the main, the traditional\r\nview of him as the prince of political jugglers still holds its own, let\r\nus admit that his bold, rough spirit, filled as it was with political\r\ndaring, was not without its strange vein of idealism. And then let us\r\nrepeat that his ear was to the ground. Much careful research has indeed\r\nbeen expended in seeking to determine who originated the policy which,\r\nabout 1853, Douglas decided to make his own. There has also been much\r\ndispute about his motives. Most of us, however, see in his course of\r\naction an instance of playing the game of politics with an audacity that\r\nwas magnificent.\r\n\r\nHis conduct may well have been the result of a combination of motives\r\nwhich included a desire to retain the favor of the Northwest, a wish\r\nto pave the way to his candidacy for the Presidency, the intention to\r\nenlist the aid of the South as well as that of his own locality, and\r\nperhaps the hope that he was performing a service of real value to his\r\ncountry. That is, he saw that the favor of his own Northwest would be\r\nlavished upon any man who opened up to settlement the rich lands beyond\r\nIowa and Missouri which were still held by the Indians, and for which\r\nthe Westerners were clamoring. Furthermore, they wanted a railroad that\r\nwould reach to the Pacific. There were, however, local entanglements and\r\npolitical cross-purposes which involved the interests of the free State\r\nof Illinois and those of the slave State of Missouri.\r\n\r\nDouglas's great stroke was a programme for harmonizing all these\r\nconflicting interests and for drawing together the West and the South.\r\nSlaveholders were to be given what at that moment they wanted most--an\r\nopportunity to expand into that territory to the north and west of\r\nMissouri which had been made free by the Compromise of 1820, while the\r\nfree Northwest was to have its railroad to the coast and also its chance\r\nto expand into the Indian country. Douglas thus became the champion of a\r\nbill which would organize two new territories, Kansas and Nebraska, but\r\nwhich would leave the settlers in each to decide whether slavery or free\r\nlabor should prevail within their boundaries. This territorial scheme\r\nwas accepted by a Congress in which the Southerners and their Northern\r\nallies held control, and what is known as the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was\r\nsigned by President Pierce on May 30,1854.*\r\n\r\n     *The origin of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill has been a much\r\n     discussed subject among historians in recent years.  The\r\n     older view that Douglas was simply playing into the hands of\r\n     the \"slavepower\" by sacrificing Kansas, is no longer\r\n     tenable.  This point has been elaborated by Allen Johnson in\r\n     his study of Douglas (\"Stephen A. Douglas: a Study in\r\n     American Politics\").  In his \"Repeal of the Missouri\r\n     Compromise\", P.O. Ray contends that the legislation of 1854\r\n     originated in a factional controversy in Missouri, and that\r\n     Douglas merely served the interests of the proslavery group\r\n     led by Senator David R. Atchinson of Missouri.  Still\r\n     another point of view is that presented in the \"Genesis of\r\n     the Kansas-Nebraska Act,\" by F. H. Hodder, who would explain\r\n     not only the division of the Nebraska Territory into Kansas\r\n     and Nebraska, but the object of the entire bill by the\r\n     insistent efforts of promoters of the Pacific railroad\r\n     scheme to secure a right of way through Nebraska.  This\r\n     project involved the organization of a territorial\r\n     government and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\n     Douglas was deeply interested in the western railroad\r\n     interests and carried through the necessary legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE PARTY OF POLITICAL EVASION\r\n\r\nIn order to understand Douglas one must understand the Democratic party\r\nof 1854 in which Douglas was a conspicuous leader. The Democrats boasted\r\nthat they were the only really national party and contended that their\r\nrivals, the Whigs and the Know-Nothings, were merely the representatives\r\nof localities or classes. Sectionalism was the favorite charge which the\r\nDemocrats brought against their enemies; and yet it was upon these very\r\nDemocrats that the slaveholders had hitherto relied, and it was upon\r\ncertain members of this party that the label, \"Northern men with\r\nSouthern principles,\" had been bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe label was not, however, altogether fair, for the motives of the\r\nDemocrats were deeply rooted in their own peculiar temperament. In the\r\nlast analysis, what had held their organization together, and what had\r\nenabled them to dominate politics for nearly the span of a generation,\r\nwas their faith in a principle that then appealed powerfully, and that\r\nstill appeals, to much in the American character. This was the principle\r\nof negative action on the part of the government--the old idea that the\r\ngovernment should do as little as possible and should confine itself\r\npractically to the duties of the policeman. This principle has seemed\r\nalways to express to the average mind that traditional individualism\r\nwhich is an inheritance of the Anglo-Saxon race. In America, in the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century, it reenforced that tradition of local\r\nindependence which was strong throughout the West and doubly strong in\r\nthe South. Then, too, the Democratic party still spoke the language of\r\nthe theoretical Democracy inherited from Jefferson. And Americans have\r\nalways been the slaves of phrases!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the close alliance of the Northern party machine with\r\nthe South made it, generally, an object of care for all those Northern\r\ninterests that depended on the Southern market. As to the Southerners,\r\ntheir relation with this party has two distinct chapters. The first\r\nembraced the twenty years preceding the Compromise of 1850, and may\r\nbe thought of as merging into the second during three or four years\r\nfollowing the great equivocation. In that period, while the antislavery\r\ncrusade was taking form, the aim of Southern politicians was mainly\r\nnegative. \"Let us alone,\" was their chief demand. Though aggressive\r\nin their policy, they were too far-sighted to demand of the North any\r\npositive course in favor of slavery. The rise of a new type of Southern\r\npolitician, however, created a different situation and began a second\r\nchapter in the relation between the South and the Democratic party\r\nmachine in the North. But of that hereafter.\r\n\r\nUntil 1854, it was the obvious part of wisdom for Southerners to\r\ncooperate as far as possible with that party whose cardinal idea was\r\nthat the government should come as near as conceivable to a system\r\nof non-interference; that it should not interfere with business, and\r\ntherefore oppose a tariff; that it should not interfere with local\r\ngovernment, and therefore applaud states rights; that it should not\r\ninterfere with slavery, and therefore frown upon militant abolition.\r\nIts policy was, to adopt a familiar phrase, one of masterly inactivity.\r\nIndeed it may well be called the party of political evasion. It was a\r\nhuge, loose confederacy of differing political groups, embracing paupers\r\nand millionaires, moderate anti-slavery men and slave barons, all of\r\nwhom were held together by the unreliable bond of an agreement not to\r\ntread on each other's toes.\r\n\r\nOf this party Douglas was the typical representative, both in strength\r\nand weakness. He had all its pliability, its good humor, its broad and\r\neasy way with things, its passion for playing politics. Nevertheless, in\r\ncalling upon the believers in political evasion to consent for this\r\nonce to reverse their principle and to endorse a positive action, he had\r\ntaken a great risk. Would their sporting sense of politics as a gigantic\r\ngame carry him through successfully? He knew that there was a hard fight\r\nbefore him, but with the courage of a great political strategist,\r\nand proudly confident in his hold upon the main body of his party, he\r\nprepared for both the attacks and the defections that were inevitable.\r\n\r\nDefections, indeed, began at once. Even before the bill had been passed,\r\nthe \"Appeal of the Independent Democrats\" was printed in a New York\r\npaper, with the signatures of members of Congress representing both the\r\nextreme anti-slavery wing of the Democrats and the organized Free-Soil\r\nparty. The most famous of these names were those of Chase and Sumner,\r\nboth of whom had been sent to the Senate by a coalition of Free-Soilers\r\nand Democrats. With them was the veteran abolitionist, Giddings of\r\nOhio. The \"Appeal\" denounced Douglas as an \"unscrupulous politician\"\r\nand sounded both the warcries of the Northern masses by accusing him of\r\nbeing engaged in \"an atrocious plot to exclude from a vast unoccupied\r\nregion immigrants from the Old World and free laborers from our own\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nThe events of the spring and summer of 1854 may all be grouped under\r\ntwo heads--the formation of an anti-Nebraska party, and the quick rush\r\nof sectional patriotism to seize the territory laid open by the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Act. The instantaneous refusal of the Northerners to\r\nconfine their settlement to Nebraska, and their prompt invasion of\r\nKansas; the similar invasion from the South; the support of both\r\nmovements by societies organized for that purpose; the war in Kansas\r\nall the details of this thrilling story have been told elsewhere.* The\r\npolitical story alone concerns us here.\r\n\r\n     *See Jesse Macy, \"The Anti-Slavery Crusade\". (In \"The\r\n     Chronicles of America\".)\r\n\r\nWhen the fight began there were four parties in the field: the\r\nDemocrats, the Whigs, the Free-Soilers, and the Know-Nothings.\r\n\r\nThe Free-Soil party, hitherto a small organization, had sought to make\r\nslavery the main issue in politics. Its watchword was \"Free soil, free\r\nspeech, free labor, and free men.\" It is needless to add that it was\r\ninstantaneous in its opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs at the moment enjoyed the greatest prestige, owing to the\r\nassociation with them of such distinguished leaders as Webster and Clay.\r\nIn 1854, however, as a party they were dying, and the very condition\r\nthat had made success possible for the Democrats made it impossible for\r\nthe Whigs, because the latter stood for positive ideas, and aimed to be\r\nnational in reality and not in the evasive Democratic sense of the term.\r\nFor, as a matter of fact, on analysis all the greater issues of the day\r\nproved to be sectional. The Whigs would not, like the Democrats, adopt a\r\nnegative attitude toward these issues, nor would they consent to become\r\nmerely sectional. Yet at the moment negation and sectionalism were the\r\nonly alternatives, and between these millstones the Whig organization\r\nwas destined to be ground to bits and to disappear after the next\r\nPresidential election.\r\n\r\nEven previous to 1854, numbers of Whigs had sought a desperate outlet\r\nfor their desire to be positive in politics and had created a new party\r\nwhich during a few years was to seem a reality and then vanish together\r\nwith its parent. The one chance for a party which had positive ideas\r\nand which wished not to be sectional was the definite abandonment of\r\nexisting issues and the discovery of some new issue not connected with\r\nsectional feeling. Now, it happened that a variety of causes, social and\r\nreligious, had brought about bad blood between native and foreigner, in\r\nsome of the great cities, and upon the issue involved in this condition\r\nthe failing spirit of the Whigs fastened. A secret society which had\r\nbeen formed to oppose the naturalization of foreigners quickly became a\r\nrecognized political party. As the members of the Society answered all\r\nquestions with \"I do not know,\" they came to be called \"Know-Nothings,\"\r\nthough they called themselves \"Americans.\" In those states where\r\nthe Whigs had been strongest--Massachusetts, New York, and\r\nPennsylvania--this last attempt to apply their former temper, though not\r\ntheir principles, had for a moment some success; but it could not escape\r\nthe fierce division which was forced on the country by Douglas. As a\r\nresult, it rapidly split into factions, one of which merged with the\r\nenemies of Douglas, while the other was lost among his supporters.\r\n\r\nWhat would the great dying Whig party leave behind it? This was the\r\nreally momentous question in 1854. Briefly, this party bequeathed\r\nthe temper of political positivism and at the same time the dread of\r\nsectionalism. The inner clue to American politics during the next few\r\nyears is, to many minds, to be found largely in the union of this old\r\nWhig temper with a new-born sectional patriotism, and, to other minds,\r\nin the gradual and reluctant passing of the Whig opposition to a\r\nsectional party. But though this transformation of the wrecks of\r\nWhiggism began immediately, and while the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was\r\nstill being hotly debated in Congress, it was not until 1860 that it was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime various incidents had shown that the sectional\r\npatriotism of the North, the fury of the abolitionists, and the positive\r\ntemper in politics, were all drawing closer together. Each of these\r\ntendencies can be briefly illustrated. For example, the rush to Kansas\r\nhad begun, and the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society was preparing to\r\nassist settlers who were going west. In May, there occurred at Boston\r\none of the most conspicuous attempts to rescue a fugitive slave, in\r\nwhich a mob led by Thomas Wentworth Higginson attacked the guards of\r\nAnthony Burns, a captured fugitive, killed one of them, but failed to\r\nget the slave, who was carried to a revenue cutter between lines of\r\nsoldiers and returned to slavery. Among numerous details of the hour the\r\nburning of Douglas in effigy is perhaps worth passing notice. In duly\r\nthe anti-Nebraska men of Michigan held a convention, at which they\r\norganized as a political party and nominated a state ticket. Of their\r\nnominees, two had hitherto ranked themselves as Free-Soilers, three as\r\nanti-slavery Democrats, and five as Whigs. For the name of their party\r\nthey chose \"Republican,\" and as the foundation of their platform the\r\nresolution \"That, postponing and suspending all differences with\r\nregard to political economy or administrative policy,\" they would \"act\r\ncordially and faithfully in unison,\" opposing the extension of slavery,\r\nand would \"cooperate and be known as 'Republicans' until the contest be\r\nterminated.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the next two years is, in its main outlines, the story\r\nof the war in Kansas and of the spread of this new party throughout the\r\nNorth. It was only by degrees, however, that the Republicans absorbed\r\nthe various groups of anti-Nebraska men. What happened at this time in\r\nIllinois may be taken as typical, and it is particularly noteworthy\r\nas revealing the first real appearance of Abraham Lincoln in American\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThough in 1854 he was not yet a national figure, Lincoln was locally\r\naccredited with keen political insight, and was, regarded in Illinois as\r\na strong lawyer. The story is told of him that, while he was attending\r\ncourt on the circuit, he heard the news of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in\r\na tavern and sat up most of the night talking about it. Next morning\r\nhe used a phrase destined to become famous. \"I tell you,\" said he to a\r\nfellow lawyer, \"this nation cannot exist half slave and half free.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln, however, was not one of the first to join the Republicans.\r\nIn Illinois, in 1854, Lincoln resigned his seat in the legislature to\r\nbecome the Whig candidate for United States senator, to succeed the\r\nDemocratic colleague of Douglas. But there was little chance of\r\nhis election, for the real contest was between the two wings of the\r\nDemocrats, the Nebraska men and the anti-Nebraska men, and Lincoln\r\nwithdrew in favor of the candidate of the latter, who was elected.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year, from the midst of his busy law practice,\r\nLincoln watched the Whig party go to pieces. He saw a great part of its\r\nvote lodge temporarily among the Know-Nothings, but before the end of\r\nthe year even they began to lose their prominence. In the autumn, from\r\nthe obscurity of his provincial life, he saw, far off, Seward, the most\r\nastute politician of the day, join the new movement. In New York, the\r\nRepublican state convention and the Whig state convention merged into\r\none, and Seward pronounced a baptismal oration upon the Republican party\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives which met in December, 1855, the\r\nanti-Nebraska men were divided among themselves, and the Know-Nothings\r\nheld the balance of power. No candidate for the speakership, however,\r\nwas able to command a majority, and finally, after it had been agreed\r\nthat a plurality would be sufficient, the contest closed, on the one\r\nhundred and thirty-third ballot, with the election of a Republican, N.\r\nP. Banks. Meanwhile in the South, the Whigs were rapidly leaving the\r\nparty, pausing a moment with the Know-Nothings, only to find that their\r\ninevitable resting-place, under stress of sectional feeling, was with\r\nthe Democrats.\r\n\r\nOn Washington's birthday, 1856, the Know-Nothing national convention met\r\nat Philadelphia. It promptly split upon the subject of slavery, and\r\na portion of its membership sent word offering support to another\r\nconvention which was sitting at Pittsburgh, and which had been called to\r\nform a national organization for the Republican party. A third assembly\r\nheld on this same day was composed of the newspaper editors of Illinois,\r\nand may be looked upon as the organization of the Republican party in\r\nthat state. At the dinner following this informal convention, Lincoln,\r\nwho was one of the speakers, was toasted as \"the next United States\r\nSenator.\"\r\n\r\nSome four months afterward, in Philadelphia, the Republicans held their\r\nfirst national convention. Only a few years previous its members\r\nhad called themselves by various names--Democrats, Free-Soilers,\r\nKnow-Nothings, Whigs. The old hostilities of these different groups had\r\nnot yet died out. Consequently, though Seward was far and away the most\r\neminent member of the new party, he was not nominated for President.\r\nThat dangerous honor was bestowed upon a dashing soldier and explorer of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and the Far West, John C. Fremont.*\r\n\r\n     *For an account of Fremont, see Stewart Edward White, \"The\r\n     Forty-Niners\" (in \"The Chronicles of America\"), Chapter II.\r\n\r\nThe key to the political situation in the North, during that momentous\r\nyear, was to be found in the great number of able Whigs who, seeing\r\nthat their own party was lost but refusing to be sidetracked by the\r\nmake-believe issue of the Know-Nothings, were now hesitating what to do.\r\nThough the ordinary politicians among the Republicans doubtless wished\r\nto conciliate these unattached Whigs, the astuteness of the leaders was\r\ntoo great to allow them to succumb to that temptation. They seem to have\r\nfeared the possible effect of immediately incorporating in their ranks,\r\nwhile their new organization was still so plastic, the bulk of those\r\nconservative classes which were, after all, the backbone of this\r\nirreducible Whig minimum.\r\n\r\nThe Republican campaign was conducted with a degree of passion that had\r\nscarcely been equaled in America before that day. To the well-ordered\r\nspirit of the conservative classes the tone which the Republicans\r\nassumed appeared shocking. Boldly sectional in their language, sweeping\r\nin their denunciation of slavery, the leaders of the campaign made\r\nbitter and effective use of a number of recent events. \"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin\", published in 1852, and already immensely popular, was used as a\r\npolitical tract to arouse, by its gruesome picture of slavery, a hatred\r\nof slaveholders. Returned settlers from Kansas went about the North\r\ntelling horrible stories of guerrilla warfare, so colored as to throw\r\nthe odium all on one side. The scandal of the moment was the attack made\r\nby Preston Brooks on Sumner, after the latter's furious diatribe in the\r\nSenate, which was published as \"The Crime Against Kansas\". With double\r\nskill the Republicans made equal capital out of the intellectual\r\nviolence of the speech and the physical violence of the retort. In\r\naddition to this, there was ready to their hands the evidence of\r\nSouthern and Democratic sympathy with a filibustering attempt to conquer\r\nthe republic of Nicaragua, where William Walker, an American adventurer,\r\nhad recently made himself dictator. Walker had succeeded in having his\r\nminister acknowledged by the Democratic Administration, and in obtaining\r\nthe endorsement of a great Democratic meeting which was held in New\r\nYork. It looked, therefore, as if the party of political evasion had an\r\nanchor to windward, and that, in the event of their losing in Kansas,\r\nthey intended to placate their Southern wing by the annexation of\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, was a stronger political tempest than Douglas, weatherwise\r\nthough he was, had foreseen. How was political evasion to brave it? With\r\na courage quite equal to the boldness of the Republicans, the Democrats\r\ntook another tack and steered for less troubled waters. Their convention\r\nat Cincinnati was temperate and discreet in all its expressions, and for\r\nPresident it nominated a Northerner, James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, a\r\nman who was wholly dissociated in the public mind from the struggle over\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party leaders knew that they already had two strong\r\ngroups of supporters. Whatever they did, the South would have to go\r\nalong with them, in its reaction against the furious sectionalism of the\r\nRepublicans. Besides the Southern support, the Democrats counted upon\r\nthe aid of the professional politicians--those men who considered\r\npolitics rather as a fascinating game than as serious and difficult work\r\nbased upon principle. Upon these the Democrats could confidently rely,\r\nfor they already had, in Douglas in the North and Toombs in the South,\r\ntwo master politicians who knew this type and its impulses intimately,\r\nbecause they themselves belonged to it. But the Democrats needed the\r\nsupport of a third group. If they could only win over the Northern\r\nremnant of the Whigs that was still unattached, their position would be\r\nsecure. In their efforts to obtain this additional and very necessary\r\nreinforcement, they decided to appear as temperate and restrained as\r\npossible--a well bred party which all mild and conservative men could\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nThis attitude they formulated in connection with Kansas, which at that\r\ntime had two governments: one, a territorial government, set up by\r\nemigrants from the South; the other, a state government, under the\r\nconstitution drawn up at Topeka by emigrants from the North. One\r\nauthorized slavery; the other prohibited slavery; and both had appealed\r\nto Washington for recognition. It was with this quite definite issue\r\nthat Congress was chiefly concerned in the spring of 1856. During the\r\nsummer Toombs introduced a bill securing to the settlers of Kansas\r\ncomplete freedom of action and providing for an election of delegates\r\nto a convention to draw up a state constitution which would determine\r\nwhether slavery or freedom was to prevail--in other words, whether\r\nKansas was to be annexed to the South or to the North. This bill was\r\nmerely the full expression of what Douglas had aimed at in 1854 and of\r\nwhat was nicknamed \"popular sovereignty\"--the right of the locality to\r\nchoose for itself between slave and free labor.\r\n\r\nTwo years before, such a measure would have seemed radical. But in\r\npolitics time is wonderfully elastic. Those two years had been packed\r\nwith turmoil. Kansas had been the scene of a bloody conflict. Regardless\r\nof which side had a majority on the ground, extremists on each side had\r\ndemanded recognition for the government set up by their own party. By\r\ncontrast, Toombs's offer to let the majority rule appeared temperate.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans saw instantly that they must discredit the proposal\r\nor the ground would be cut from under them. Though the bill passed the\r\nSenate, they were able to set it aside in the House in favor of a bill\r\nadmitting Kansas as a free state with the Topeka constitution. The\r\nDemocrats thereupon accused the Republicans of not wanting peace and of\r\nwishing to keep up the war-cry \"Bleeding Kansas\" until election time.\r\n\r\nThat, throughout the country, the two parties continued on the lines\r\nof policy they had chosen may be seen from an illustration. A House\r\ncommittee which had gone to Kansas to investigate submitted two reports,\r\none of which, submitted by a Democratic member, told the true story of\r\nthe murders committed by John Brown at Pottawatomie. And yet, while\r\nthe Republicans spread everywhere their shocking tales of murders of\r\nfree-state settlers, the Democrats made practically no use of this\r\nequally shocking tale of the murder of slaveholders. Apparently they\r\nwere resolved to appear temperate and conservative to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nAnd they had their reward. Or, perhaps the fury of the Republicans had\r\nits just deserts. From either point of view, the result was a choice of\r\nevils on the part of the reluctant Whigs, and that choice was expressed\r\nin the following words by as typical a New Englander as Rufus Choate:\r\n\"The first duty of Whigs,\" wrote Choate to the Maine State central\r\ncommittee, \"is to unite with some organization of our countrymen\r\nto defeat and dissolve the new geographical party calling itself\r\nRepublican.... The question for each and every one of us is...by what\r\nvote can I do most to prevent the madness of the times from working its\r\nmaddest act the very ecstasy of its madness--the permanent formation and\r\nthe actual triumph of a party which knows one half of America only\r\nto hate and dread it. If the Republican party,\" Choate continued,\r\n\"accomplishes its object and gives the government to the North, I turn\r\nmy eyes from the consequences. To the fifteen states of the South that\r\ngovernment will appear an alien government. It will appear worse. It\r\nwill appear a hostile government. It will represent to their eye a\r\nvast region of states organized upon anti-slavery, flushed by triumph,\r\ncheered onward by the voice of the pulpit, tribune, and press;\r\nits mission, to inaugurate freedom and put down the oligarchy; its\r\nconstitution, the glittering and sounding generalities of natural\r\nright which make up the Declaration of Independence.... Practically the\r\ncontest, in my judgment, is between Mr. Buchanan and Colonel Fremont. In\r\nthese circumstances, I vote for Mr. Buchanan.\"\r\n\r\nThe party of political evasion thus became the refuge of the old\r\noriginal Whigs who were forced to take advantage of any port in a storm.\r\nBuchanan was elected by an overwhelming majority. To the careless\r\neye, Douglas had been justified by results; his party had triumphed as\r\nperhaps never before; and yet, no great political success was ever\r\nbased upon less stable foundations. To maintain this position, those\r\nNortherners who reasoned as Choate did were a necessity; but to keep\r\nthem in the party of political evasion would depend upon the ability of\r\nthis party to play the game of politics without acknowledging sectional\r\nbias. Whether this difficult task could be accomplished would depend\r\nupon the South. Toombs, on his part, was anxious to continue making the\r\nparty of evasion play the great American game of politics, and in\r\nhis eagerness he perhaps overestimated his hold upon the South. This,\r\nhowever, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nAlready another faction had formed around William L. Yancey of\r\nAlabama--a faction as intolerant of political evasion as the Republicans\r\nthemselves, and one that was eager to match the sectional Northern party\r\nby a sectional Southern party. It had for the moment fallen into line\r\nwith the Toombs faction because, like the Whigs, it had not the courage\r\nto do otherwise. The question now was whether it would continue fearful,\r\nand whether political evasion would continue to reign.\r\n\r\nThe key to the history of the next four years is in the growth of this\r\npositive Southern party, which had the inevitable result of forcing the\r\nWhig remainder to choose, not as in 1856 between a positive sectional\r\npolicy and an evasive nonsectional policy, but in 1860 between two\r\npolicies both of which were at once positive and sectional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE POLITICIANS AND THE NEW DAY\r\n\r\nThe South had thus far been kept in line with the cause of political\r\nevasion by a small group of able politicians, chief among whom were\r\nRobert Toombs, Howell Cobb, and Alexander H. Stephens. Curiously enough\r\nall three were Georgians, and this might indeed be called the day of\r\nGeorgia in the history of the South.\r\n\r\nA different type of man, however, and one significant of a divergent\r\npoint of view, had long endeavored to shake the leadership of the\r\nGeorgian group. Rhett in South Carolina, Jefferson Davis in Mississippi,\r\nand above all Yancey in Alabama, together with the interests and\r\nsentiment which they represented, were almost ready to contest the\r\northodoxy of the policy of \"nothing doing.\" To consolidate the interests\r\nbehind them, to arouse and fire the sentiment on which they relied, was\r\nnow the confessed purpose of these determined men. So little attention\r\nhas hitherto been given to motive in American politics that the modern\r\nstudent still lacks a clear-cut and intelligent perception of these\r\nvarious factions. In spite of this fact, however, these men may safely\r\nbe regarded as being distinctly more intellectual, and as having\r\ndistinctly deeper natures, than the men who came together under\r\nthe leadership of Toombs and Cobb, and who had the true provincial\r\nenthusiasm for politics as the great American sport.\r\n\r\nThe factions of both Toombs and Yancey were intensely Southern and,\r\nwhenever a crisis might come, neither meant to hesitate an instant over\r\nstriking hard for the South. Toombs, however, wanted to prevent such a\r\nsituation, while Yancey was anxious to force one. The former conceived\r\nfelicity as the joy of playing politics on the biggest stage, and he\r\ntherefore bent all his strength to preserving the so-called national\r\nparties; the latter, scornful of all such union, was for a separate\r\nSouthern community.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, no man could become enthusiastic about political evasion\r\nunless by nature he also took kindly to compromise. So, Toombs and his\r\nfollowers were for preserving the negative Democratic position of 1856.\r\nIn a formal paper of great ability Stephens defended that position when\r\nhe appeared for reelection to Congress in 1857. Cobb, who had entered\r\nBuchanan's Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, and who spoke hopefully\r\nof making Kansas a slave state, insisted nevertheless that such a change\r\nmust be \"brought about by the recognized principles of carrying out the\r\nwill of the majority which is the great doctrine of the Kansas Bill.\"\r\nTo Yancey, as to the Republicans, Kansas was a disputed border-land for\r\nwhich the so-called two nations were fighting.\r\n\r\nThe internal Southern conflict between these two factions began anew\r\nwith the Congressional elections of 1857. It is worth observing that the\r\nmake-up of these factions was almost a resurrection of the two groups\r\nwhich, in 1850, had divided the South on the question of rejecting the\r\nCompromise. In a letter to Stephens in reference to one of the Yancey\r\nmen, Cobb prophesied: \"McDonald will utterly fail to get up a new\r\nSouthern Rights party. Burnt children dread the fire, and he cannot get\r\nup as strong an organization as he did in 1850. Still it is necessary\r\nto guard every point, as McDonald is a hard hand to deal with.\" For the\r\nmoment, he foretold events correctly. The Southern elections of 1857 did\r\nnot break the hold of the moderates.\r\n\r\nYancey turned to different machinery, quite as useful for his purpose.\r\nThis he found in the Southern commercial conventions, which were held\r\nannually. At this point there arises a vexed question which has, of\r\nlate, aroused much discussion. Was there then what we should call\r\ntoday a slave \"interest\"? Was organized capital deliberately exploiting\r\nslavery? And did Yancey play into its hands?* The truth seems to be\r\nthat, between 1856 and 1860, both the idealist parties, the Republicans\r\nand the Secessionists, made peace with, shall we say, the Mammon of\r\nunrighteousness, or merely organized capital? The one joined hands with\r\nthe iron interest of the North; the other, with the slave interest of\r\nthe South. The Republicans preached the domination of the North and a\r\nprotective tariff; the Yancey men preached the independence of the South\r\nand the reopening of the slave trade.\r\n\r\n     * For those who would be persuaded that there was such a\r\n     slave interest, perhaps the best presentation is to be found\r\n     in Professor Dodd's Life of Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\nThese two issues Yancey, however, failed to unite, though the commercial\r\nconvention of 1859 at last gave its support to a resolution that all\r\nlaws, state or federal, prohibiting the African slave trade ought to be\r\nrepealed. That great body of Northern capital which had dealings with\r\nthe South was ready, as it always had been, to finance any scheme that\r\nSouthern business desired. Slavers were fitted out in New York, and\r\nthe city authorities did not prevent their sailing. Against this somber\r\nbackground stands forth that much admired action of Lewis Cass of\r\nMichigan, Buchanan's Secretary of State. Already the slave trade was\r\nin process of revival, and the British Navy, impelled by the powerful\r\nanti-slavery sentiment in England, was active in its suppression.\r\nAmerican ships suspected of being slavers were visited and searched.\r\nCass seized his opportunity, and declaring that such things \"could not\r\nbe submitted to by an independent nation without dishonor,\" sent out\r\nAmerican warships to prevent this interference. Thereupon the British\r\ngovernment consented to give up trying to police the ocean against\r\nslavers. It is indeed true, therefore, that neither North nor South has\r\nan historical monopoly of the support of slavery!\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add that, so far as the movement to reopen the slave\r\ntrade found favor outside the slave barons and their New York allies,\r\nit was advocated as a means of political defense, of increasing Southern\r\npopulation as an offset to the movement of free emigration into the\r\nNorth, and of keeping the proportion of Southern representation in\r\nCongress. Stephens, just after Cass had successfully twisted the lion's\r\ntail, took this position in a speech that caused a sensation. In a\r\nprivate letter he added, \"Unless we get immigration from abroad, we\r\nshall have few more slave states. This great truth seems to take the\r\npeople by surprise. Some shrink from it as they would from death. Still,\r\nit is as true as death.\" The scheme, however, never received general\r\nacceptance; and in the constitution of the Southern Confederacy there\r\nwas a section prohibiting the African slave trade. On the other of\r\nthese two issues--the independence of the South--Yancey steadily\r\ngained ground. With each year from 1856 to 1860, a larger proportion of\r\nSoutherners drew out of political evasion and gave adherence to the\r\nidea of presenting an ultimatum to the North, with secession as an\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Buchanan sent to Kansas, as Governor, Robert J. Walker,\r\none of the most astute of the Democrats of the opposite faction and a\r\nMississippian. The tangled situation which Walker found, the details\r\nof his attempt to straighten it out, belong in another volume.* It is\r\nenough in this connection merely to mention the episode of the Lecompton\r\nconvention in the election of which the Northern settlers refused to\r\nparticipate, though Walker had promised that they should have full\r\nprotection and a fair count as well as that the work of the convention\r\nshould be submitted to a popular vote. This action of Walker's was one\r\nmore cause of contention between the warring factions in the South. The\r\nfact that he had met the Northerners half-way was seized upon by the\r\nYancey men as evidence of the betrayal of the South by the Democratic\r\nmoderates. On the other hand, Cobb, writing of the situation in Kansas,\r\nsaid that \"a large majority are against slavery and... our friends regard\r\nthe fate of Kansas as a free state pretty well fixed... the pro-slavery\r\nmen, finding that Kansas was likely to become a Black Republican State,\r\ndetermined to unite with the free-state Democrats.\" Here is the clue to\r\nWalker's course. As a strict party man, he preferred to accept Kansas\r\nfree, with Democrats in control, rather than risk losing it altogether.\r\n\r\n     * See Jesse Macy, \"The Anti-Slavery Crusade\".  (In \"The\r\n     Chronicles of America\".)\r\n\r\nThe next step in the affair is one of the unsolved problems in American\r\nhistory. Buchanan suddenly changed front, disgraced Walker, and threw\r\nhimself into the arms of the Southern extremists. Though his reasons\r\nfor doing so have been debated to this day, they have not yet been\r\nestablished beyond dispute. What seems to be the favorite explanation\r\nis that Buchanan was in a panic. What brought him to that condition may\r\nhave been the following events.\r\n\r\nThe free-state men, by refusing to take part in electing the convention,\r\nhad given control to the slaveholders, who proved they were not slow to\r\nseize their opportunity. They drew up a constitution favoring slavery,\r\nbut this constitution, Walker had promised, was to be submitted in\r\nreferendum. If the convention decided, however, not to submit the\r\nconstitution, would not Congress have the right to accept it and admit\r\nKansas as a Mate? This question was immediately raised. It now became\r\nplain that, by refusing to take part in the election, the free-state\r\nKansans had thrown away a great tactical advantage. Of this blunder in\r\ngeneralship the Yancey men took instant advantage. It was known that\r\nthe proportion of Free-Soilers in Kansas was very great--perhaps a\r\nmajority--and the Southerners reasoned that they should not be obliged\r\nto give up the advantage they had won merely to let their enemies\r\nretrieve their mistake. Jefferson Davis formulated this position in\r\nan address to the Mississippi Legislature in which he insisted that\r\nCongress, not the Kansas electorate, was entitled to create the Kansas\r\nconstitution, that the Convention was a properly chosen body, and that\r\nits work should stand. What Davis said in a stately way, others said in\r\na furious way. Buchanan stated afterward that he changed front because\r\ncertain Southern States had threatened that, if he did not abandon\r\nWalker, they would secede.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Buchanan did abandon Walker and threw all the\r\ninfluence of the Administration in favor of admitting Kansas with the\r\nLecompton constitution. But would this be true to that principle of\r\n\"popular sovereignty\" which was the very essence of the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nAct? Would it be true to the principle that each locality should decide\r\nfor itself between slavery and freedom? On this issue the Southerners\r\nwere fairly generally agreed and maintained that there was no obligation\r\nto go behind the work of the convention. Not so, however, the great\r\nexponent of popular sovereignty, Douglas. Rising in his place in the\r\nSenate, he charged the President with conspiring to defeat the will of\r\nthe majority in Kansas. \"If Kansas wants a slave state constitution,\"\r\nsaid he, \"she has a right to it; if she wants a free state constitution,\r\nshe has a right to it. It is none of my business which way the slavery\r\nclause is decided. I care not whether it is voted up or down.\"\r\n\r\nThere followed one of those prolonged legislative battles for which the\r\nCongress of the United States is justly celebrated. Furious oratory,\r\npropositions, counter-propositions, projected compromises, other\r\ncompromises, and at the end nothing positive. But Douglas had defeated\r\nthe attempt to bring in Kansas with the Lecompton constitution. As to\r\nthe details of the story, they include such distinguished happenings as\r\na brawling, all-night session when \"thirty men, at least, were engaged\r\nin the fisticuff,\" and one Representative knocked another down.\r\n\r\nDouglas was again at the center of the stage, but his term as Senator\r\nwas nearing its end. He and the President had split their party. Pursued\r\nby the vengeful malice of the Administration, Douglas went home in\r\n1858 to Illinois to fight for his reelection. His issue, of course,\r\nwas popular sovereignty. His temper was still the temper of political\r\nevasion. How to hold fast to his own doctrine, and at the same time\r\nkeep to his programme of \"nothing doing\"; how to satisfy the negative\r\nDemocrats of the North without losing his last hold on the positive\r\nmen of the South--such were his problems, and they were made still more\r\ndifficult by a recent decision of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe now famous case of Dred Scott had been decided in the previous\r\nyear. Its bewildering legal technicalities may here be passed over;\r\nfundamentally, the real question involved was the status of a negro,\r\nDred Scott. A slave who had been owned in Missouri, and who had been\r\ntaken by his master to the State of Illinois, to the free territory\r\nof Minnesota, and then back to Missouri, now claimed to be free. The\r\nSupreme Court undertook to decide whether his residence in Minnesota\r\nrendered him free, and also whether any negro of slave descent could\r\nbe a citizen of the United States. The official opinion of the Court,\r\ndelivered by Chief Justice Taney, decided both questions against\r\nthe suppliant. It was held that the \"citizens\" recognized by the\r\nConstitution did not include negroes. So, even if Scott were free, he\r\ncould not be considered a citizen entitled to bring suit in the Federal\r\nCourts. Furthermore, he could not be considered free, in spite of his\r\nresidence in Minnesota, because, as the Court now ruled, Congress, when\r\nit enacted the Missouri Compromise, had exceeded its authority;\r\nthe enactment had never really been in force; there was no binding\r\nprohibition of slavery in the Northwestern territories.\r\n\r\nIf this decision was good law, all the discussion about popular\r\nsovereignty went for nothing, and neither an act of Congress nor the\r\nvote of the population of a territory, whether for or against slavery,\r\nwas of any value whatsoever. Nothing mattered until the newmade state\r\nitself took action after its admission to the Union. Until that time, no\r\npower, national or local, could lawfully interfere with the introduction\r\nof slaves. In the case of Kansas, it was no longer of the least\r\nimportance what became of the Lecompton constitution or of any other\r\nthat the settlers might make. The territory was open to settlement\r\nby slaveholders and would continue to be so as long as it remained\r\na territory. The same conditions existed in Nebraska and in all the\r\nNorthwest. The Dred Scott decision was accepted as orthodox Democratic\r\ndoctrine by the South, by the Administration, and by the \"Northern men\r\nwith Southern principles.\" The astute masters of the game of politics\r\non the Democratic side struck the note of legality. This was law, the\r\nexpression of the highest tribunal of the Republic; what more was to be\r\nsaid? Though in truth there was but one other thing to be said, and that\r\nrevolutionary, the Republicans, nevertheless, did not falter over it.\r\nSeward announced it in a speech in Congress on \"Freedom in Kansas,\" when\r\nhe uttered this menace: \"We shall reorganize the Court and thus reform\r\nits political sentiments and practices.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1858 Douglas attempted to perform the acrobatic feat\r\nof reconciling the Dred Scott decision, which as a Democrat he had\r\nto accept, with that idea of popular sovereignty without which his\r\nimmediate followers could not be content. In accepting the Republican\r\nnomination as Douglas's opponent for the senatorship, Lincoln used these\r\nwords which have taken rank among his most famous utterances: \"A house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot\r\nendure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union\r\nto be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it\r\nwill cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\r\nEither the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\r\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it\r\nis in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states, old as well\r\nas new--North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nNo one had ever so tellingly expressed the death-grapple of the sections:\r\nslavery the weapon of one, free labor the weapon of the other. Though\r\nLincoln was at that time forty-nine years old, his political experience,\r\nin contrast with that of Douglas, was negligible. He afterward aptly\r\ndescribed his early life in that expressive line from Gray, \"The short\r\nand simple annals of the poor.\" He lacked regular schooling, and it\r\nwas altogether from the practice of law that he had gained such formal\r\neducation as he had. In law, however, he had become a master, and his\r\nposition, to judge from the class of cases entrusted to him, was second\r\nto none in Illinois. To that severe yet wholesome cast of mind which\r\nthe law establishes in men naturally lofty, Lincoln added the\r\ntonic influence of a sense of style--not the verbal acrobatics of a\r\nrhetorician, but that power to make words and thought a unit which\r\nmakes the artist of a man who has great ideas. How Lincoln came by this\r\nliterary faculty is, indeed, as puzzling as how Burns came by it. But\r\nthere it was, disciplined by the court room, made pungent by familiarity\r\nwith plain people, stimulated by constant reading of Shakespeare, and\r\nchastened by study of the Bible.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Douglas and Lincoln should tour the State together\r\nin a series of joint debates. As a consequence there followed a most\r\ninteresting opposition of methods in the use of words, a contest between\r\nthe method formed in Congress at a time when Congress was a perfect\r\nrhetorical academy, and that method of using words which was based on\r\nan arduous study of Blackstone, Shakespeare, and Isaiah. Lincoln issued\r\nfrom the debates one of the chief intellectual leaders of America, and\r\nwith a place in English literature; Douglas came out a Senator from\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nBut though Douglas kept his following together, and though Lincoln was\r\nvoted down, to Lincoln belonged the real strategic victory. In order\r\nto save himself with his own people, Douglas had been forced to make\r\nadmissions that ruined him with the South. Because of these admissions\r\nthe breach in the party of political evasion became irreparable. It was\r\nin the debate at Freeport that Douglas's fate overtook him, for Lincoln\r\nput this question: \"Can the people of a United States territory, in\r\nany lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States,\r\nexclude slavery from its limits, prior to the formation of a state\r\nconstitution?\"\r\n\r\nDouglas answered in his best style of political thunder. \"It matters\r\nnot,\" he said, \"what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to\r\nthe abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory\r\nunder the Constitution; the people have the lawful means to introduce it\r\nor exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist\r\na day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police\r\nregulations. Those police regulations can only be established by the\r\nlocal legislatures; and if the people are opposed to slavery, they will\r\nelect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation\r\neffectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the\r\ncontrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension.\r\nHence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on\r\nthat abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave\r\nterritory or a free territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the moral aspect of his actions, Douglas must ultimately be judged\r\nby the significance which this position in which he placed himself\r\nassumed in his own mind. Friendly critics excuse him: an interpretation\r\nof the Dred Scott decision which explained it away as an irresponsible\r\nutterance on a subject outside the scope of the case, a mere obiter\r\ndictum, is the justification which is called in to save him from\r\nthe charge of insincerity. His friends, today, admit that this\r\ninterpretation was bad law, but maintain that it may have been good\r\nmorals, and that Douglas honestly held it. But many of us have not yet\r\nadvanced so far in critical generosity, and cannot help feeling that\r\nDouglas's position remains political legerdemain--an attempt by a great\r\nofficer of the government, professing to defend the Supreme Court, to\r\nshow the people how to go through the motions of obedience to the Court\r\nwhile defeating its intention. If not double-dealing in a strict sense,\r\nit must yet be considered as having in it the temper of double-dealing.*\r\nThis was, indeed, the view of many men of his own day and, among them,\r\nof Lincoln. Yet the type of man on whom the masters of the game of\r\npolitics relied saw nothing in Douglas's position at which to be\r\ndisturbed. It was merely playing politics, and if that absorbing sport\r\nrequired one to carry water on both shoulders, why--play the game!\r\nDouglas was the man for people like that. They cheered him to the echo\r\nand sent him back to the Senate. So well was this type understood by\r\nsome of Lincoln's friends that they had begged him, at least according\r\nto tradition, not to put the question at Freeport, as by doing so he\r\nwould enable Douglas to save himself with his constituency. Lincoln saw\r\nfurther, however. He understood better than they the forces then at work\r\nin America. The reply reported of him was: \"If Douglas answers, he can\r\nnever be President, and the battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of this.\"\r\n\r\n     * There are three ways of regarding Douglas's position: (1)\r\n     As a daring piece of evasion designed to hold all the\r\n     Democrats together; (2) as an attempt to secure his locality\r\n     at all costs, taking his chances on the South; (3) as a\r\n     sincere expression of the legal interpretation mentioned\r\n     above.  It is impossible in attempting to choose among these\r\n     to escape wholly one's impression of the man's character.\r\n\r\nWell might Yancey and his followers receive with a shout of joy the\r\n\"Freeport Doctrine,\" as Douglas's supreme evasion was called. Should\r\nSoutherners trust any longer the man who had evolved from the principle\r\nof let-'em-alone to the principle of double-dealing? However, the\r\nSoutherners were far from controlling the situation. Though the events\r\nof 1858 had created discord in the Democratic party, they had not\r\nconsolidated the South. Men like Toombs and Stephens were still hopeful\r\nof keeping the States together in the old bond of political evasion. The\r\nDemocratic machine, damaged though it was, had not yet lost its hold on\r\nthe moderate South, and while that continued to be the case, there was\r\nstill power in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE CRISIS\r\n\r\nThe Southern moderates in 1859 form one of those political groups,\r\nnumerous enough in history, who at a crisis arrest our imagination\r\nbecause of the irony of their situation. Unsuspecting, these men went\r\ntheir way, during the last summer of the old regime, busy with the\r\nordinary affairs of state, absorbed in their opposition to the Southern\r\nradicals, never dreaming of the doom that was secretly moving toward\r\nthem through the plans of John Brown. In the soft brilliancy of the\r\nSouthern summer when the roses were in bloom, many grave gentlemen\r\nwalked slowly up and down together under the oaks of their plantation\r\navenues, in the grateful dusk, talking eagerly of how the scales\r\ntrembled in Southern politics between Toombs and Yancey, and questioning\r\nwhether the extremists could ride down the moderate South and reopen the\r\nslave trade. In all their wondering whether Douglas would ever come back\r\nto them or would prove the blind Samson pulling down their temple about\r\ntheir ears, there was never a word about the approaching shadow which\r\nwas so much more real than the shades of the falling night, and yet so\r\nentirely shut away from their observation.\r\n\r\nIn this summer, Stephens withdrew as he thought from public life.\r\nWith an intensely sensitive nature, he had at times flashes of strange\r\nfeeling which an unsophisticated society would regard as prophetic\r\ninspirations. When he left Washington \"on the beautiful morning of the\r\n5th of March, 1859, he stood at the stern of the boat for some minutes\r\ngazing back at the capital.\" He had announced his intention of not\r\nstanding again as a Representative, and one of his fellow-passengers\r\nasked jokingly whether he was thinking of his return as a Senator.\r\nStephen's reply was full of emotion, \"No, I never expect to see\r\nWashington again unless I am brought here as a prisoner of war.\" During\r\nthe summer he endeavored to cast off his intuition of approaching\r\ndisaster. At his plantation, \"Liberty Hall,\" he endeavored to be content\r\nwith the innumerable objects associated with his youth; he tried to feel\r\nagain the grace of the days that were gone, the mysterious loveliness of\r\nthe Southern landscape with its immense fields, its forests, its great\r\nempty spaces filled with glowing sunshine. He tried to possess his\r\ntroubled soul with the severe intellectual ardor of the law. But his\r\ngift of second sight would not rest. He could not overcome his intuition\r\nthat, for all the peace and dreaminess of the outward world, destiny\r\nwas upon him. Looking out from his spiritual seclusion, he beheld what\r\nseemed to him complete political confusion, both local and national. His\r\ndespairing mood found expression a little later in the words: \"Indeed\r\nif we were now to have a Southern convention to determine upon the true\r\npolicy of the South either in the Union or out of it, I should expect to\r\nsee just as much profitless discussion, disagreement, crimination, and\r\nrecrimination amongst the members of it from different states and from\r\nthe same state, as we witness in the present House of Representatives\r\nbetween Democrats, Republicans, and Americans.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the sources of confusion Stephens saw, close at home, was the\r\nSouthern battle over the reopening of the slave trade. The reality\r\nof that issue had been made plain in May, 1859, when the Southern\r\ncommercial congress at Vicksburg entertained at the same time two\r\nresolutions: one, that the convention should urge all Southern States\r\nto amend their constitutions by a clause prohibiting the increase\r\nof African slavery; the other, that the convention urge all the\r\nLegislatures of Southern States to present memorials to Congress asking\r\nthe repeal of the law against African slave trade. Of these opposed\r\nresolutions, the latter was adopted on the last day of the convention*,\r\nthough the moderates fought hard against it.\r\n\r\n     *It is significant that the composition of these Southern\r\n     commercial congresses and the Congress of the whole Southern\r\n     people was strikingly different in personnel.  Very few\r\n     members of the commercial congresses reappear in the\r\n     Confederate Congress.\r\n\r\nThe split between Southern moderates and Southern radicals was further\r\nindicated by their differing attitudes toward the adventurers from\r\nthe United States in Central America. The Vicksburg Convention\r\nadopted resolutions which were thinly veiled endorsements of southward\r\nexpansion. In the early autumn another Nicaraguan expedition was nipped\r\nin the bud by the vigilance of American naval forces. Cobb, prime factor\r\nin the group of Southern moderates as well as Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwrote to Buchanan expressing his satisfaction at the event, mentioning\r\nthe work of his own department in bringing it about, and also alluding\r\nto his arrangements to prevent slave trading off the Florida coast.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of doubt was strong even among the moderates. Douglas was\r\nthe target. Stephens gives a glimpse of it in a letter written during\r\nhis last session in Congress. \"Cobb called on me Saturday night,\" he\r\nwrites. \"He is exceedingly bitter against Douglas. I joked him a good\r\ndeal, and told him he had better not fight, or he would certainly be\r\nwhipped; that is, in driving Douglas out of the Democratic party.\r\nHe said that if Douglas ever was restored to the confidence of the\r\nDemocracy of Georgia, it would be over his dead body politically. This\r\nshows his excitement, that is all. I laughed at him, and told him he\r\nwould run his feelings and his policy into the ground.\" The anger\r\nof Cobb, who was himself a confessed candidate for the Democratic\r\nnomination, was imperiling the Democratic national machine which Toombs\r\nwas still struggling so resolutely to hold together. Indeed, as late as\r\nthe autumn of 1859 the machine still held together.\r\n\r\nThen came the man of destiny, the bolt from the blue, the end of the\r\nchapter. A marvelous fanatic--a sort of reincarnation of the grimmest\r\nof the Covenanters--by one daring act shattered the machine and made\r\nimpossible any further coalition on the principle of \"nothing doing.\"\r\nThis man of destiny was John Brown, whose attack on Harper's Ferry took\r\nplace October 16th, and whose execution by the authorities of Virginia\r\non the charges of murder and treason occurred on the 2nd of December.\r\n\r\nThe incident filled the South with consternation. The prompt\r\ncondemnation of it by many Republican leaders did not offset, in the\r\nminds of Southerners, the fury of praise accorded by others. The South\r\nhad a ghastly tradition derived chiefly from what is known as Nat\r\nTurner's Rebellion in Virginia, a tradition of the massacre of white\r\nwomen and children by negroes. As Brown had set opt to rouse a slave\r\nrebellion, every Southerner familiar with his own traditions shuddered,\r\nidentifying in imagination John Brown and Nat Turner. Horror became rage\r\nwhen the Southerners heard of enthusiastic applause in Boston and of\r\nEmerson's description of Brown as \"that new saint\" who was to \"make the\r\ngallows glorious like the cross.\" In the excitement produced by remarks\r\nsuch as this, justice was not done to Lincoln's censure. In his speech\r\nat Cooper Institute in New York, in February, 1860, Lincoln had said:\r\n\"John Brown's effort...in its philosophy corresponds with the many\r\nattempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors.\r\nAn enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people, until he fancies\r\nhimself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt\r\nwhich ends in little else than in his own execution.\" A few months\r\nafterwards, the Republican national convention condemned the act of\r\nBrown as \"among the gravest of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nAn immediate effect of the John Brown episode was a passionate outburst\r\nfrom all the radical press of the South in defense of slavery. The\r\nfollowers of Yancey made the most of their opportunity. The men who\r\nvoted at Vicksburg to reopen the slave trade could find no words to\r\nmeasure their hatred of every one who, at this moment of crisis, would\r\nnot declare slavery a blessing. Many of the men who opposed the slave\r\ntraders also felt that, in the face of possible slave insurrection,\r\nthe peril of their families was the one paramount consideration.\r\nNevertheless, it is easy for the special pleader to give a\r\nwrong impression of the sentiment of the time. A grim desire for\r\nself-preservation took possession of the South, as well as a deadly fear\r\nof any person or any thing that tended directly or indirectly to incite\r\nthe blacks to insurrection. Northerners of abolitionist sympathies were\r\nwarned to leave the country, and in some cases they were tarred and\r\nfeathered.\r\n\r\nGreat anger was aroused by the detection of book-agents who were\r\ndistributing a furious polemic against slavery, \"The Impending Crisis\r\nof the South: How to Meet It\", by Hinton Rowan Helper, a Southerner of\r\ninferior social position belonging to the class known as poor whites.\r\nThe book teemed with such sentences as this, addressing slaveholders:\r\n\"Do you aspire to become victims of white non-slave-holding vengeance by\r\nday and of barbarous massacres by the negroes at night?\" It is scarcely\r\nstrange, therefore, that in 1859 no Southerner would hear a good word of\r\nanyone caught distributing the book. And yet, in the midst of all this\r\nvehement exaltation of slavery, the fight to prevent a reopening of\r\nthe slave trade went bravely on. Stephens, writing to a friend who was\r\ncorrespondent for the \"Southern Confederacy\", in Atlanta, warned him in\r\nApril, 1860, \"neither to advocate disunion or the opening of the slave\r\ntrade. The people here at present I believe are as much opposed to it\r\nas they are at the North; and I believe the Northern people could be\r\ninduced to open it sooner than the Southern people.\"\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1859-1860 witnessed a famous congressional battle over\r\nthe speakership. The new Congress which met in December contained\r\n109 Republicans, 101 Democrats, and 27 Know-Nothings. The Republican\r\ncandidate for speaker was John Sherman of Ohio. As the first ballot\r\nshowed that he could not command a majority, a Democrat from Missouri\r\nintroduced this resolution \"Whereas certain members of this House, now\r\nin nomination for speaker, did endorse the book hereinafter mentioned,\r\nresolved, That the doctrines and sentiments of a certain book, called\r\n'The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It', are insurrectionary\r\nand hostile to the peace and tranquillity of the country, and that no\r\nmember of this House, who has indorsed or recommended it, is fit to be\r\nspeaker of the House.\"\r\n\r\nDuring two months there were strange scenes in the House, while the\r\nclerk acted as temporary speaker and furious diatribes were thundered\r\nback and forth across the aisle that separated Republicans from\r\nDemocrats, with a passage of fisticuffs or even a drawn pistol to add\r\nvariety to the scene. The end of it all was a deal. Pennington, of the\r\n\"People's Party\" of New Jersey, who had supported Sherman but had not\r\nendorsed Helper, was given the Republican support; a Know-Nothing was\r\nmade sergeant-at-arms; and Know-Nothing votes added to the Republican\r\nvotes made Pennington speaker. In many Northern cities the news of his\r\nelection was greeted with the great salute of a hundred guns, but at\r\nRichmond the papers came out in mourning type.\r\n\r\nTwo great figures now advanced to the center of the Congressional\r\nstage--Jefferson Davis, Senator from Mississippi, a lean eagle of a man\r\nwith piercing blue eyes, and Judah P. Benjamin, Senator from Louisiana,\r\nwhose perpetual smile cloaked an intellect that was nimble, keen, and\r\nruthless. Both men were destined to play leading roles in the lofty\r\ndrama of revolution; each was to experience a tragic ending of his\r\npolitical hope, one in exile, the other in a solitary proscription amid\r\nthe ruins of the society for which he had sacrificed his all. These men,\r\nthough often spoken of as mere mouthpieces of Yancey, were in reality\r\nquite different from him both in temper and in point of view.\r\n\r\nDavis, who was destined eventually to become the target of Yancey's\r\nbitterest enmity, had refused ten years before to join in the secession\r\nmovement which ignored Calhoun's doctrine that the South had become a\r\nsocial unit. Though a believer in slavery under the conditions of the\r\nmoment, Davis had none of the passion of the slave baron for slavery at\r\nall costs. Furthermore, as events were destined to show in a startlingly\r\ndramatic way, he was careless of South Carolina's passion for state\r\nrights. He was a practical politician, but not at all the old type of\r\nthe party of political evasion, the type of Toombs. No other man of the\r\nmoment was on the whole so well able to combine the elements of Southern\r\npolitics against those more negative elements of which Toombs was the\r\nsymbol. The history of the Confederacy shows that the combination which\r\nDavis now effected was not as thorough as he supposed it was. But at the\r\nmoment he appeared to succeed and seemed to give common purpose to the\r\nvast majority of the Southern people. With his ally Benjamin, he struck\r\nat the Toombs policy of a National Democratic party.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the election of Pennington, Davis introduced in\r\nthe Senate a series of resolutions which were to serve as the Southern\r\nultimatum, and which demanded of Congress the protection of slavery\r\nagainst territorial legislatures. This was but carrying to its logical\r\nconclusion that Dred Scott decision which Douglas and his followers\r\nproposed to accept. If Congress could not restrict slavery in the\r\nterritories, how could its creature, a territorial legislature do so?\r\nAnd yet the Douglas men attempted to take away the power from Congress\r\nand to retain it for the territorial legislatures. Senator Pugh of Ohio\r\nhad already locked horns with Davis on this point, and had attempted to\r\nshow that a territorial Legislature was independent of Congress. \"Then\r\nI would ask the Senator further,\" retorted the logical Davis, \"why it is\r\nhe makes an appropriation to pay members of the territorial legislature;\r\nhow it is that he invests the Governor with veto power over their acts;\r\nand how it is that he appoints judges to decide upon the validity of\r\ntheir acts.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Democratic convention which met at Charleston in April, 1860, the\r\nwaning power of political evasion made its last real stand against the\r\nrising power of political positivism. To accept Douglas and the idea\r\nthat somehow territorial legislatures were free to do what Congress\r\ncould not do, or to reject Douglas and endorse Davis's ultimatum--that\r\nin substance was the issue. \"In this convention where there should be\r\nconfidence and harmony,\" said the \"Charleston Mercury\", \"it is plain\r\nthat men feel as if they were going into a battle.\" In the committee on\r\nresolutions where the States were equally represented, the majority were\r\nanti-Douglas; they submitted a report affirming Davis's position that\r\nterritorial legislatures had no right to prohibit slavery and that the\r\nFederal Government should protect slavery against them. The minority\r\nrefused to go further than an approval of the Dred Scott case and a\r\npledge to abide by all future decisions of the Supreme Court. After\r\nboth reports had been submitted, there followed the central event of the\r\nconvention--the now famous speech by Yancey which repudiated political\r\nevasion from top to bottom, frankly defended slavery, and demanded\r\neither complete guarantees for its continued existence or, as an\r\nalternative, Southern independence. Pugh instantly replied and summed up\r\nYancey's speech as a demand upon Northern Democrats to say that slavery\r\nwas right, and that it was their duty not only to let slavery alone but\r\nto aid in extending it. \"Gentlemen of the South,\" he exclaimed, \"you\r\nmistake us--you mistake us--we will not do it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the full convention, where the representation of the States was not\r\nequal, the Douglas men, after hot debate, forced the adoption of the\r\nminority report. Thereupon the Alabama delegation protested and formally\r\nwithdrew from the convention, and other delegations followed. There was\r\nwild excitement in Charleston, where that evening in the streets Yancey\r\naddressed crowds that cheered for a Southern republic. The remaining\r\nhistory of the Democratic nominations is a matter of detail. The\r\nCharleston convention adjourned without making nominations. Each of\r\nits fragments reorganized as a separate convention, and ultimately\r\ntwo Democratic tickets were put into the field, with Breckinridge of\r\nKentucky as the candidate on the Yancey ticket and Douglas on the other.\r\n\r\nWhile the Democrats were thus making history through their fateful\r\nbreak-up into separate parties, a considerable number of the so-called\r\nbest people of the country determined that they had nowhere politically\r\nto lay their heads. A few of the old Whigs were still unable to\r\nconsort either with Republicans or with Democrats, old or new. The\r\nKnow-Nothings, likewise, though their number had been steadily melting\r\naway, had not entirely disappeared. To unite these political remnants\r\nin any definite political whole seemed beyond human ingenuity. A common\r\nsentiment, however, they did have--a real love of the Union and a\r\nreal unhappiness, because its existence appeared to be threatened.\r\nThe outcome was that they organized the Constitutional Union Party,\r\nnominating for President John Bell of Tennessee, and for Vice President\r\nEdward Everett of Massachusetts. Their platform was little more than\r\na profession of love of the Union and a condemnation of sectional\r\nselfishness.\r\n\r\nThis Bell and Everett ticket has a deeper significance than has\r\ngenerally been admitted. It reveals the fact that the sentiment of\r\nUnion, in distinction from the belief in the Union, had become a real\r\nforce in American life. There could be no clearer testimony to the\r\nstrength of this feeling than this spectacle of a great congregation of\r\nmoderate people, unable to agree upon anything except this sentiment,\r\nstepping between the sectional parties like a resolute wayfarer going\r\nforward into darkness along a perilous strand between two raging seas.\r\nThat this feeling of Union was the same thing as the eager determination\r\nof the Republicans, in 1860, to control the Government is one of those\r\nhistorical fallacies that have had their day. The Republican party\r\nbecame, in time and under stress of war, the refuge of this sentiment\r\nand proved sufficiently far-sighted to merge its identity temporarily in\r\nthe composite Union party of 1864. But in 1860 it was still a sectional\r\nparty. Among its leaders Lincoln was perhaps the only Unionist in the\r\nsame sense as Bell and Everett.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the truest Unionists of the North, outside the Constitutional\r\nUnion Party, in 1860, were those Democrats in the following of Douglas\r\nwho, after fighting to the last ditch against both the sectional\r\nparties, were to accept, in 1861, the alternative of war rather than\r\ndissolution. The course of Douglas himself, as we shall see hereafter,\r\nshowed that in his mind there was a fixed limit of concession beyond\r\nwhich he could not go. When circumstances forced him to that limit,\r\nthe sentiment of Union took control of him, swept aside his political\r\njugglery, abolished his time-serving, and drove him into cooperation\r\nwith his bitterest foes that the Union might be saved. Nor was the pure\r\nsentiment of Union confined to the North and West. Though undoubtedly\r\nthe sentiment of locality was more powerful through the South, yet when\r\nthe test came in the election of 1860, the leading candidate of the\r\nupper South, in Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, was John Bell, the\r\nConstitutional Unionist. In every Southern State this sentiment was able\r\nto command a considerable part of the vote.*\r\n\r\n     *A possible exception was South Carolina.  As the\r\n     presidential electors were appointed by the legislature,\r\n     there is no certain record of minority sentiment.\r\n\r\nWidely different in temper were those stern and resolute men whose\r\norganization, in perfect fighting trim, faced eagerly the divided\r\nDemocrats. The Republicans had no division among themselves upon\r\ndoctrine. Such division as existed was due to the ordinary rivalry\r\nof political leaders. In the opinion of all his enemies and of most\r\nAmericans, Seward was the Republican man of the hour. During much of\r\n1859 he had discreetly withdrawn from the country and had left to his\r\npartisans the conduct of his campaign, which seems to have been going\r\nwell when he returned in the midst of the turmoil following the death\r\nof John Brown. Nevertheless he was disturbed over his prospects, for he\r\nfound that in many minds, both North and South, he was looked upon\r\nas the ultimate cause of all the turmoil. His famous speech on the\r\n\"irrepressible conflict\" was everywhere quoted as an exultant prophecy\r\nof these terrible latter days.\r\n\r\nIt was long the custom to deny to Seward any good motive in a speech\r\nwhich he now delivered, just as it was to deny Webster any good motive\r\nfor his famous 7th of March speech. But such criticism is now less\r\nfrequent than it used to be. Both men were seeking the Presidency;\r\nboth, we may fairly believe, were shocked by the turmoil of political\r\ncurrents; each tried oiling the waters, and in the attempt each\r\nruined his candidacy. Seward's speech in condemnation of John Brown\r\nin February, 1860, was an appeal to the conservative North against the\r\nradical North, and to many of his followers it seemed a change of front.\r\nIt certainly gained him no new friends and it lost him some old ones, so\r\nthat his star as a presidential candidate began its decline.\r\n\r\nThe first ballot in the Republican convention surprised the country.\r\nOf the votes, 233 were necessary for a choice. Seward had only 173 1/2.\r\nNext to him, with 102 votes, stood none of the leading candidates, but\r\nthe comparatively obscure Lincoln. A gap of more than 50 votes separated\r\nLincoln from Cameron, Chase, and Bates. On the second ballot Seward\r\ngained 11 votes, while Lincoln gained 79. The enemies of Seward, finding\r\nit impossible to combine on any of the conspicuous candidates, were\r\nmoving toward Lincoln, the man with fewest enemies. The third ballot\r\ngave Lincoln the nomination.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that one of the basal questions of the time was which new\r\npolitical group should absorb the Whig remainder. The Constitutional\r\nUnion party aimed to accomplish this. The Republicans sought to\r\nout-maneuver them. They made their platform as temperate as they could\r\nand yet consistent with the maintenance of their opposition to Douglas\r\nand popular sovereignty; and they went no further in their anti-slavery\r\ndemands than that the territories should be preserved for free labor.\r\n\r\nAnother basal question had been considered in the Republican platform.\r\nWhere would Northern capital stand in the reorganization of parties?\r\nWas capital, like men, to become frankly sectional or would it remain\r\nimpersonal, careless how nations rose or fell, so long as dividends\r\ncontinued? To some extent capital had given an answer. When, in the\r\nexcitement following the John Brown incident, a Southern newspaper\r\npublished a white list of New York merchants whose political views\r\nshould commend them to Southerners, and a black list of those who\r\nwere objectionable, many New Yorkers sought a place in the white list.\r\nNorthern capital had done its part in financing the revived slave trade.\r\nAugust Belmont, the New York representative of the Rothschilds, was one\r\nof the close allies of Davis, Yancey, and Benjamin in their war upon\r\nDouglas. In a word, a great portion of Northern capital had its heart\r\nwhere its investments were--in the South. But there was other capital\r\nwhich obeyed the same law, and which had investments in the North;\r\nand with this capital the Republicans had been trafficking. They had\r\nsucceeded in winning over the powerful manufacturing interests of\r\nPennsylvania, the pivotal State that had elected Buchanan in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe steps by which the new party of enthusiasm made its deal with the\r\nbody of capital which was not at one with Belmont and the Democrats are\r\nnot essential to the present narrative. Two facts suffice. In 1857 a\r\ngreat collapse in American business--\"the panic of fifty-seven\"--led\r\nthe commercial world to turn to the party in power for some scheme of\r\nredress. But their very principles, among which was non-intervention in\r\nbusiness, made the Democrats feeble doctors for such a need, and\r\nthey evaded the situation. The Republicans, with their insistence on\r\npositivism in government, had therefore an opportunity to make a new\r\napplication of the doctrine of governmental aid to business. In the\r\nspring of 1860, the Republican House of Representatives passed the\r\nMorrill tariff bill, consideration of which was postponed by the\r\nDemocratic Senate. But it served its purpose: it was a Republican\r\nmanifesto. The Republicans felt that this bill, together with their\r\nparty platform, gave the necessary guarantee to the Pennsylvania\r\nmanufacturers, and they therefore entered the campaign confident they\r\nwould carry Pennsylvania nor was their confidence misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was characterized by three things: by an ominous quiet\r\ncoupled with great intensity of feeling; by the organization of huge\r\nparty societies in military form--\"Wide-awakes\" for Lincoln, numbering\r\n400,000, and \"Minute Men\" for Breckenridge, with a membership chiefly\r\nSouthern; and by the perfect frankness, in all parts of the South, of\r\nthreats of secession in case the Republicans won.\r\n\r\nIn none of the States which eventually seceded were any votes cast for\r\nLincoln, with the exception of a small number in Virginia. In almost all\r\nthe other Southern States and in the slave-holding border States, all\r\nthe other candidates made respectable showings. In Virginia, Tennessee,\r\nand Kentucky, Bell led. But everywhere else in the other slave-holding\r\nStates Breckinridge led, excepting in Missouri where Douglas won by a\r\nfew hundred. Every free State except New Jersey went for Lincoln.\r\nAnd yet he did not have a majority of the popular vote, which stood:\r\nLincoln, 1,866,459; Douglas, 1,376,957; Breckinridge, 849,781; Bell,\r\n588,879*. The majority against Lincoln was nearly a million. The\r\ndistribution of the votes was such that Lincoln had in the Electoral\r\nCollege, 180 electors; Breckinridge, 72; Bell, 39; Douglas, 12. In\r\nneither House of Congress did the Republicans have a majority.\r\n\r\n     *The figures of the popular vote are variously given by\r\n     different compilers.  These are taken from Stanwood, \"A\r\n     History of the Presidency\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. SECESSION\r\n\r\nIn tracing American history from 1854 to 1860 we cannot fail to observe\r\nthat it reduces itself chiefly to a problem in that science which\r\npoliticians understand so well--applied psychology. Definite types\r\nof men moulded by the conditions of those days are the determining\r\nfactors--not the slavery question in itself; not, primarily, economic\r\nforces; not a theory of government, nor a clash of theories; not any one\r\nthing; but the fluid, changeful forces of human nature, battling with\r\ncircumstances and expressing themselves in the fashion of men's minds.\r\nTo say this is to acknowledge the fatefulness of sheer feeling. Davis\r\ndescribed the situation exactly when he said, in 1860, \"A sectional\r\nhostility has been substituted for a general fraternity.\" To his own\r\nquestion, \"Where is the remedy?\" he gave the answer, \"In the hearts of\r\nthe people.\" There, after all, is the conclusion of the whole matter.\r\nThe strife between North and South had ceased to be a thing of the head;\r\nit had become a thing of the heart. Granted the emotions of 1860,\r\nthe way in which our country staggered into war has all the terrible\r\nfascination of a tragedy on the theme of fate.\r\n\r\nThat a secession movement would begin somewhere in the South before the\r\nend of 1860 was a foregone conclusion. South Carolina was the logical\r\nplace, and in South Carolina the inevitable occurred. The presidential\r\nelection was quickly followed by an election of delegates, on the 6th of\r\nDecember, to consider in convention the relations of the State with the\r\nUnion. The arguments before the Convention were familiar and had been\r\nadvocated since 1851. The leaders of the disunionists were the same\r\nwho had led the unsuccessful movement of ten years before. The central\r\nfigure was Rhett, who never for a moment had wavered. Consumed his life\r\nlong by the one idea of the independence of South Carolina, that stern\r\nenthusiast pressed on to a triumphant conclusion. The powers which had\r\ndefeated him in 1851 were now either silent or converted, so that\r\nthere was practically no opposition. In a burst of passionate zeal the\r\nindependence of South Carolina was proclaimed on December 20, 1860, by\r\nan ordinance of secession.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, by one of those dramatic coincidences which make history\r\nstranger than fiction, Lincoln took a step which supplemented this\r\naction and established its tragic significance. What that step was will\r\nappear in a moment.\r\n\r\nEven before the secession began, various types of men in politics had\r\nbegun to do each after his kind. Those whom destiny drove first into a\r\ncorner were the lovers of political evasion. The issue was forced upon\r\nthem by the instantaneous demand of the people of South Carolina for\r\npossession of forts in Charleston Harbor which were controlled by the\r\nFederal Government. Anticipating such a demand, Major Robert Anderson,\r\nthe commandant at Charleston, had written to Buchanan on the 23d of\r\nNovember that \"Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney must be garrisoned\r\nimmediately, if the Government determines to keep command of this\r\nharbor.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mind of every American of the party of political evasion, there\r\nnow began a sad, internal conflict. Every one of them had to choose\r\namong three courses: to shut his eyes and to continue to wail that the\r\nfunction of government is to do nothing; to make an end of political\r\nevasion and to come out frankly in approval of the Southern position;\r\nor to break with his own record, to emerge from his evasions on the\r\nopposite side, and to confess himself first and before all a supporter\r\nof the Union. One or another of these three courses, sooner or later,\r\nevery man of the President's following chose. We shall see presently the\r\nrelative strength of the three groups into which that following broke\r\nand what strange courses sometimes tragic, sometimes comic--two of the\r\nthree pursued. For the moment our concern is how the division manifested\r\nitself among the heads of the party at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe President took the first of the three courses. He held it with the\r\nnervous clutch of a weak nature until overmastered by two grim men who\r\ngradually hypnotized his will. The turning-point for Buchanan, and the\r\nlast poor crisis in his inglorious career, came on Sunday, December\r\n30th. Before that day arrived, his vacillation had moved his friends to\r\npity and his enemies to scorn. One of his best friends wrote privately,\r\n\"The President is pale with fear\"; and the hostile point of view found\r\nexpression in such comments as this, \"Buchanan, it is said, divides\r\nhis time between praying and crying. Such a perfect imbecile never held\r\noffice before.\"\r\n\r\nWith the question what to do about the forts hanging over his bewildered\r\nsoul, Buchanan sent a message to Congress on December 4, 1860, in which\r\nhe sought to defend the traditional evasive policy of his party. He\r\ndenied the constitutional right of secession, but he was also denied his\r\nown right to oppose such a course. Seward was not unfair to the mental\r\ncaliber of the message when he wrote to his wife that Buchanan showed\r\n\"conclusively that it is the duty of the President to execute the\r\nlaws--unless somebody opposes him; and that no State has a right to go\r\nout of the Union unless it wants to.\"\r\n\r\nThis message of Buchanan's hastened the inevitable separation of the\r\nDemocratic party into its elements. The ablest Southern member of the\r\nCabinet, Cobb, resigned. He was too strong an intellect to continue\r\nthe policy of \"nothing doing\" now that the crisis had come. He was too\r\ndevoted a Southerner to come out of political evasion except on one\r\nside. On the day Cobb resigned the South Carolina Representatives called\r\non Buchanan and asked him not to make any change in the disposition\r\nof troops at Charleston, and particularly not to strengthen Sumter,\r\na fortress on an island in the midst of the harbor, without at least\r\ngiving notice to the state authorities. What was said in this interview\r\nwas not put in writing but was remembered afterward in different ways\r\nwith unfortunate consequences.\r\n\r\nEvery action of Buchanan in this fateful month continued the\r\ndisintegration of his following. Just as Cobb had to choose between his\r\nreasonings as a Democratic party man and his feelings as a Southerner,\r\nso the aged Cass, his Secretary of State, and an old personal friend,\r\nnow felt constrained to choose between his Democratic reasoning and\r\nhis Northern sympathies, and resigned from the Cabinet on the 11th of\r\nDecember. Buchanan then turned instinctively to the strongest natures\r\nthat remained among his close associates. It is a compliment to the\r\ninnate force of Jeremiah S. Black, the Attorney-General, that Buchanan\r\nadvanced him to the post of Secretary of State and allowed him to name\r\nas his successor in the Attorney-Generalship Edwin M. Stanton. Both were\r\ntried Democrats of the old style, \"let-'em-alone\" sort; and both had\r\nsupported the President in his Kansas policy. But each, like every\r\nother member of his party, was being forced by circumstances to make his\r\nchoice among the three inevitable courses, and each chose the Northern\r\nside. At once the question of the moment was whether the new Secretary\r\nof State and his powerful henchmen would hypnotize the President.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of weeks the issue hung in the balance. Then there\r\nappeared at Washington commissioners from South Carolina \"empowered to\r\ntreat...for the delivery of forts...and other real estate\" held by\r\nthe Federal Government within their State. On the day following their\r\narrival, Buchanan was informed by telegraph that Anderson had dismantled\r\nFort Moultrie on the north side of the harbor, had spiked its guns,\r\nand had removed its garrison to the island fortress, Sumter, which\r\nwas supposed to be far more defensible. At Charleston his action was\r\ninterpreted as preparation for war; and all South Carolinians saw in\r\nit a violation of a pledge which they believed the President had given\r\ntheir congressmen, three weeks previous, in that talk which had not been\r\nwritten down. Greatly excited and fearful of designs against them, the\r\nSouth Carolina commissioners held two conferences with the President\r\non the 27th and 28th of December. They believed that he had broken his\r\nword, and they told him so. Deeply agitated and refusing to admit\r\nthat he had committed himself at the earlier conference, he said that\r\nAnderson had acted on his own responsibility, but he refused to order\r\nhim back to the now ruined Fort Moultrie. One remark which he let fall\r\nhas been remembered as evidence of his querulous state of mind: \"You\r\nare pressing me too importunately\" exclaimed the unhappy President;\r\n\"you don't give me time to consider; you don't give me time to say my\r\nprayers; I always say my prayers when required to act upon any great\r\nstate affair.\" One remembers Hampden \"seeking the Lord\" about ship\r\nmoney, and one realizes that the same act may have a vastly different\r\nsignificance in different temperaments.\r\n\r\nBuchanan, however, was virtually ready to give way to the demand of the\r\ncommissioners. He drew up a paper to that effect and showed it to the\r\nCabinet. Then the turning-point came. In a painful interview, Black,\r\nlong one of his most trusted friends, told him of his intention to\r\nresign, and that Stanton would go with him and probably also the\r\nPostmaster-General, Holt. The idea of losing the support of these strong\r\npersonalities terrified Buchanan, who immediately fell into a panic.\r\nHanding Black the paper he had drawn up, Buchanan begged him to retain\r\noffice and to alter the paper as he saw fit. To this Black agreed. The\r\ndemand for the surrender of the forts was refused; Anderson was not\r\nordered back to Moultrie; and for the brief remainder of Buchanan's\r\nadministration Black acted as prime minister.\r\n\r\nA very powerful section of the Northern democracy, well typified by\r\ntheir leaders at Washington, had thus emerged from political evasion\r\non the Northern side. These men, known afterwards as War Democrats,\r\ncombined with the Republicans to form the composite Union party which\r\nsupported Lincoln. It is significant that Stanton eventually reappeared\r\nin the Cabinet as Lincoln's Secretary of War, and that along with him\r\nappeared another War Democrat, Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the\r\nNavy. With them, at last, Douglas, the greatest of all the old Democrats\r\nof the North, took his position. What became of the other factions of\r\nthe old Democratic party remains to be told.\r\n\r\nWhile Buchanan, early in the month, was weeping over the pitilessness\r\nof fate, more practical Northerners were grappling with the question\r\nof what was to be done about the situation. In their thoughts they\r\nanticipated a later statesman and realized that they were confronted by\r\na condition and not by a theory. Secession was at last a reality. Which\r\ncourse should they take?\r\n\r\nWhat strikes us most forcibly, as we look back upon that day, is the\r\nwidespread desire for peace. The abolitionists form a conspicuous\r\nexample. Their watchword was \"Let the erring sisters go in peace.\"\r\nWendell Phillips, their most gifted orator, a master of spoken style at\r\nonce simple and melodious, declaimed splendidly against war. Garrison,\r\nin \"The Liberator\", followed his example. Whittier put the same feeling\r\ninto his verse:\r\n\r\nThey break the links of Union; shall we light The flames of hell to weld\r\nanew the chain On that red anvil where each blow is pain?\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley said in an editorial in the \"New York Tribune\": \"If the\r\ncotton states shall decide that they can do better out of the Union\r\nthan in it, we shall insist on letting them go in peace. Whenever a\r\nconsiderable section of our Union shall deliberately resolve to go out,\r\nwe shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep them in. We hope\r\nnever to live in a republic where one section is pinned to the residue\r\nby bayonets.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democrats naturally clung to their traditions, and, even when they\r\nwent over, as Black and Stanton did, to the Anti-Southern group, they\r\nstill hoped that war would not be the result. Equally earnest against\r\nwar were most of the Republicans, though a few, to be sure, were ready\r\nto swing the \"Northern hammer.\" Summer prophesied that slavery would\r\n\"go down in blood.\" But the bulk of the Republicans were for a sectional\r\ncompromise, and among them there was general approbation of a scheme\r\nwhich contemplated reviving the line of the Missouri Compromise, and\r\nthus frankly admitting the existence of two distinct sections, and\r\nguaranteeing to each the security of its own institutions. The greatest\r\nRepublican boss of that day, Thurlow Weed, came out in defense of this\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nNo power was arrayed more zealously on the side of peace of any kind\r\nthan the power of money. It was estimated that two hundred millions of\r\ndollars were owed by Southerners to Northerners. War, it was reasoned,\r\nwould cause the cancellation of these obligations. To save their\r\nSouthern accounts, the moneyed interests of the North joined the\r\nextremists of Abolition in pleading to let the erring sisters go\r\nin peace, if necessary, rather than provoke them to war and the\r\nconfiscation of debts. It was the dread of such an outcome--which\r\nfinally happened and ruined many Northern firms--that caused the\r\nstock-market in New York to go up and down with feverish uncertainty.\r\nBanks suspended payment in Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.\r\nThe one important and all-engrossing thing in the mind's eye of all\r\nthe financial world at this moment was that specter of unpaid Southern\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Senator Crittenden of Kentucky submitted to the Senate\r\na plan which has been known ever since as the Crittenden Compromise. It\r\nwas similar to Weed's plan, but it also provided that the division of\r\nthe country on the Missouri Compromise line should be established by\r\na constitutional amendment, which would thus forever solidify\r\nsectionalism. Those elements of the population generally called the\r\nconservative and the responsible were delighted. Edward Everett wrote to\r\nCrittenden, \"I saw with great satisfaction your patriotic movement, and\r\nI wish from the bottom of my heart it might succeed\"; and August Belmont\r\nin a letter to Crittenden spoke for the moneyed interest: \"I have yet\r\nto meet the first Union-loving man, in or out of politics, who does not\r\napprove your compromise proposition....\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate submitted the Compromise to a Committee of Thirteen. In this\r\ncommittee the Southern leaders, Toombs and Davis, were both willing to\r\naccept the Compromise, if a majority of the Republican members would\r\nagree. Indeed, if the Republicans would agree to it, there seemed\r\nno reason why a new understanding between the sections might not be\r\nreached, and no reason why sectionalism, if accepted as the basis of the\r\ngovernment, might not solve the immediate problem and thus avert war.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis all eyes were turned to Seward, that conspicuous\r\nRepublican who was generally looked upon as the real head of his\r\nparty. And Seward, at that very moment, was debating whether to accept\r\nLincoln's offer of the Secretaryship of State, for he considered it\r\nvital to have an understanding with Lincoln on the subject of the\r\nCompromise. He talked the matter over with Weed, and they decided that\r\nWeed should go to Springfield and come to terms with Lincoln. It was the\r\ninterview between Weed and Lincoln held, it seems, on the very day on\r\nwhich the Ordinance of Secession was adopted--which gave to that day its\r\ndouble significance.\r\n\r\nLincoln refused point-blank to accept the compromise and he put his\r\nrefusal in writing. The historic meaning of his refusal, and the\r\nsignificance of his determination not to solve the problem of the hour\r\nby accepting a dual system of government based on frankly sectional\r\nassumptions, were probably, in a measure, lost on both Weed and Seward.\r\nThey had, however, no misunderstanding of its practical effect. This\r\ncrude Western lawyer had certain ideas from which he would not budge,\r\nand the party would have to go along with him. Weed and Seward therefore\r\npromptly fell into line, and Seward accepted the Secretaryship and came\r\nout in opposition to the Compromise. Other Republicans with whom Lincoln\r\nhad communicated by letter made known his views, and Greeley announced\r\nthem in The Tribune. The outcome was the solid alignment of all the\r\nRepublicans in Congress against the Compromise. As a result, this last\r\nattempt to reunite the sections came to nothing.\r\n\r\nNot more than once or twice, if ever, in American history, has there\r\nbeen such an anxious New Year's Day as that which ushered in 1861. A\r\nfew days before, a Republican Congressman had written to one of his\r\nconstituents: \"The heavens are indeed black and an awful storm is\r\ngathering...I see no way that either North or South can escape its\r\nfury.\" Events were indeed moving fast toward disaster. The garrison at\r\nSumter was in need of supplies, and in the first week of the new year\r\nBuchanan attempted to relieve its wants. But a merchant vessel, the Star\r\nof the West, by which supplies were sent, was fired upon by the South\r\nCarolina authorities as it approached the harbor and was compelled to\r\nturn back. This incident caused the withdrawal from the Cabinet of the\r\nlast opposition members--Thompson, of Mississippi, the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, and Thomas, of Maryland, the Secretary of the Treasury. In the\r\ncourse of the month five Southern States followed South Carolina out\r\nof the Union, and their Senators and Representatives resigned from the\r\nCongress of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Jefferson Davis was communicated to the Senate in a\r\nspeech of farewell which even now holds the imagination of the student,\r\nand which to the men of that day, with the Union crumbling around\r\nthem, seemed one of the most mournful and dramatic of orations. Davis\r\npossessed a beautiful, melodious voice; he had a noble presence, tall,\r\nerect, spare, even ascetic, with a flashing blue eye. He was deeply\r\nmoved by the occasion; his address was a requiem. That he withdrew in\r\nsorrow but with fixed determination, no one who listened to him could\r\ndoubt. Early in February, the Southern Confederacy was formed with Davis\r\nas its provisional President. With the prophetic vision of a logical\r\nmind, he saw that war was inevitable, and he boldly proclaimed his\r\nvision. In various speeches on his way South, he had assured the\r\nSouthern people that war was coming, and that it would be long and\r\nbloody.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of these Southern members threw the control of the House\r\ninto the hands of the Republicans. Their realization of their power\r\nwas expressed in two measures which also passed the Senate; Kansas was\r\nadmitted--as a State with an anti-slavery constitution; and the Morrill\r\ntariff, which they had failed to pass the previous spring, now\r\nbecame law. Thus the Republicans began redeeming their pledges to the\r\nanti-slavery men on the one hand and to the commercial interest on the\r\nother. The time had now arrived for the Republican nominee to proceed\r\nfrom Springfield to Washington. The journey was circuitous in order to\r\nenable Lincoln to speak at a number of places. Never before, probably,\r\nhad the Northern people felt such tense strain as at that moment; never\r\nhad they looked to an incoming President with such anxious doubt.\r\nWould he prevent war? Or, if he could not do that, would he be able\r\nto extricate the country--Heaven alone knew how!--without a terrible\r\nordeal? Since his election, Lincoln had remained quietly at Springfield.\r\nThough he had influenced events through letters to Congressmen, his one\r\nconspicuous action during that winter was the defeat of the Crittenden\r\nCompromise. The Southern President had called upon his people to put\r\ntheir house in order as preparation for war. What, now, had Lincoln to\r\nsay to the people of the North?\r\n\r\nThe biographers of Lincoln have not satisfactorily revealed the state of\r\nhis mind between election and inauguration. We may safely guess that his\r\nsilence covered a great internal struggle. Except for his one action in\r\ndefeating the Compromise, he had allowed events to drift; but by that\r\none action he had taken upon himself the responsibility for the drift.\r\nThough the country at that time did not fully appreciate this aspect of\r\nthe situation, who now can doubt that Lincoln did? His mind was always a\r\nlonely one. His very humor has in it, so often, the note of solitude,\r\nof one who is laughing to make the best of things, of one who is\r\nspiritually alone. During those months when the country drifted from\r\nits moorings, and when war was becoming steadily more probable, Lincoln,\r\nafter the manner of the prophets, wrestled alone with the problems which\r\nhe saw before him. From the little we know of his inward state, it is\r\nhard for us to conclude that he was happy. A story which is told by his\r\nformer partner, Mr. Herndon, seems significant. As Lincoln was leaving\r\nhis unpretentious law-office for the last time, he turned to Mr. Herndon\r\nand asked him not to take down their old sign. \"Let it hang there\r\nundisturbed,\" said he. \"Give our clients to understand that the election\r\nof a President makes no difference in the firm.... If I live, I'm coming\r\nback some time, and then we'll go right on practising law as if nothing\r\nhad happened.\"\r\n\r\nHow far removed from self-sufficiency was the man whose thoughts, on\r\nthe eve of his elevation to the Presidency, lingered in a provincial law\r\noffice, fondly insistent that only death should prevent his returning\r\nsome time and resuming in those homely surroundings the life he had\r\nled previous to his greatness. In a mood of wistfulness and of intense\r\npreoccupation, he began his journey to Washington. It was not the mood\r\nfrom which to strike fire and kindle hope. To the anxious, listening\r\ncountry his speeches on the journey to Washington were disappointing.\r\nPerhaps his strangely sensitive mind felt too powerfully the fatefulness\r\nof the moment and reacted with a sort of lightness that did not really\r\nrepresent the real man. Be that as it may, he was never less convincing\r\nthan at that time. Nor were people impressed by his bearing. Often he\r\nappeared awkward, too much in appearance the country lawyer. He acted as\r\na man who was ill at ease and he spoke as a man who had nothing to say.\r\nGloom darkened the North as a consequence of these unfortunate speeches,\r\nfor they expressed an optimism which we cannot believe he really felt,\r\nand which hurt him in the estimation of the country. \"There is no\r\ncrisis but an artificial one,\" was one of his ill-timed assurances, and\r\nanother, \"There is nothing going wrong.... There is nothing that really\r\nhurts any one.\" Of his supporters some were discouraged; others were\r\nexasperated; and an able but angry partisan even went so far as to write\r\nin a private letter, \"Lincoln is a Simple Susan.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth of March arrived, and with it the end of Lincoln's\r\nblundering. One good omen for the success of the new Administration was\r\nthe presence of Douglas on the inaugural platform. He had accepted fate,\r\ndeeply as it wounded him, and had come out of the shattered party of\r\nevasion on the side of his section. For the purpose of showing his\r\nsupport of the administration at this critical time, he had taken a\r\nplace on the stand where Lincoln was to speak. By one of those curious\r\nlittle dramatic touches with which chance loves to embroider history,\r\nthe presence of Douglas became a gracious detail in the memory of the\r\nday. Lincoln, worn and awkward, continued to hold his hat in his hand.\r\nDouglas, with the tact born of social experience, stepped forward and\r\ntook it from him without--exposing Lincoln's embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address which Lincoln now pronounced had little similarity\r\nto those unfortunate utterances which he had made on the journey to\r\nWashington. The cloud that had been over him, whatever it was, had\r\nlifted. Lincoln was ready for his great labor. The inaugural contained\r\nthree main propositions. Lincoln pledged himself not to interfere\r\ndirectly or indirectly with slavery in the States where it then existed;\r\nhe promised to support the enforcement of the fugitive slave law; and he\r\ndeclared he would maintain the Union. \"No State,\" said he, \"upon its own\r\nmere motion can lawfully get out of the Union.... To the extent of my\r\nability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins\r\nupon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the\r\nStates.... In doing this, there need be no bloodshed or violence; and\r\nthere shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\r\nThe power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\r\nthe property and places belonging to the government.\" Addressing the\r\nSoutherners, he said: \"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen,\r\nand not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government\r\nwill not assail you.... We are not enemies but friends.... The mystic\r\ncords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to\r\nevery living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet\r\nswell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will\r\nbe, by the better angels of our nature.\"\r\n\r\nGentle, as was the phrasing of the inaugural, it was perfectly firm, and\r\nit outlined a policy which the South would not accept, and which, in the\r\nopinion of the Southern leaders, brought them a step nearer war. Wall\r\nStreet held the same belief, and as a consequence the price of stocks\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. WAR\r\n\r\nOn the day following the inauguration, commissioners of the newly formed\r\nConfederacy appeared at Washington and applied to the Secretary of State\r\nfor recognition as envoys of a foreign power. Seward refused them such\r\nrecognition. But he entered into a private negotiation with them which\r\nis nearly, if not quite, the strangest thing in our history. Virtually,\r\nSeward intrigued against Lincoln for control of the Administration. The\r\nevents of the next five weeks have an importance out of all proportion\r\nto the brevity of the time. This was Lincoln's period of final\r\nprobation. The psychological intensity of this episode grew from the\r\nconsciousness in every mind that now, irretrievably, destiny was to be\r\ndetermined. War or peace, happiness or adversity, one nation or two--all\r\nthese were in the balance. Lincoln entered the episode a doubtful\r\nquantity, not with certainty the master even in his own Cabinet. He\r\nemerged dominating the situation, but committed to the terrible course\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nOne cannot enter upon this great episode, truly the turning point in\r\nAmerican history, without pausing for a glance at the character of\r\nSeward. The subject is elusive. His ablest biographer* plainly is so\r\nconstantly on guard not to appear an apologist that he ends by reducing\r\nhis portrait to a mere outline, wavering across a background of\r\npolitical details. The most recent study of Seward** surely reveals\r\nbetween the lines the doubtfulness of the author about pushing his\r\npoints home. The different sides of the man are hard to reconcile. Now\r\nhe seemed frank and honest; again subtle and insincere. As an active\r\npolitician in the narrow sense, he should have been sagacious and\r\nastute, yet he displayed at the crisis of his life the most absolute\r\nfatuity. At times he had a buoyant and puerile way of disregarding\r\nfact and enveloping himself in a world of his own imagining. He could\r\nbluster, when he wished, like any demagogue; and yet he could be\r\npersuasive, agreeable, and even personally charming.\r\n\r\n     *Frederic Bancroft, \"Life of William H. Seward\".\r\n\r\n     ** Gamaliel Bradford, \"Union Portraits\".\r\n\r\nBut of one thing with regard to Seward, in the first week of March,\r\n1861, there can be no doubt: he thought himself a great statesman--and\r\nhe thought Lincoln \"a Simple Susan.\" He conceived his role in the new\r\nadministration to involve a subtle and patient manipulation of his\r\nchildlike superior. That Lincoln would gradually yield to his spell\r\nand insensibly become his figurehead; that he, Seward, could save the\r\ncountry and would go down to history a statesman above compare, he took\r\nfor granted. Nor can he fairly be called conceited, either; that is part\r\nof his singularity.\r\n\r\nLincoln's Cabinet was, as Seward said, a compound body. With a view to\r\nstrengthening his position, Lincoln had appointed to cabinet positions\r\nall his former rivals for the Republican nomination. Besides Seward,\r\nthere was Chase as Secretary of the Treasury; Simon Cameron of\r\nPennsylvania as Secretary of War; Edward Bates of Missouri as\r\nAttorney-General. The appointment of Montgomery Blair of Maryland as\r\nPostmaster-General was intended to placate the border Slave States. The\r\nsame motive dictated the later inclusion of James Speed of Kentucky in\r\nthe Cabinet. The Black-Stanton wing of the Democrats was represented in\r\nthe Navy Department by Gideon Welles, and in course of time in the War\r\nDepartment also, when Cameron resigned and Stanton succeeded him. The\r\nWest of that day was represented by Caleb B. Smith of Indiana.\r\n\r\nSeward disapproved of the composition of the Cabinet so much that,\r\nalmost at the last moment, he withdrew his acceptance of the State\r\nDepartment. It was Lincoln's gentleness of argument which overcame his\r\nreluctance to serve. We may be sure, however, that Seward failed to\r\nobserve that Lincoln's tactlessness in social matters did not extend to\r\nhis management of men in politics; we may feel sure that what remained\r\nin his mind was Lincoln's unwillingness to enter office without William\r\nHenry Seward as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe promptness with which Seward assumed the role of prime minister\r\nbears out this inference. The same fact also reveals a puzzling detail\r\nof Seward's character which amounted to obtuseness--his forgetfulness\r\nthat appointment to cabinet offices had not transformed his old\r\npolitical rivals Chase and Cameron, nor softened the feelings of an\r\ninveterate political enemy, Welles, the Secretary of the Navy. The\r\nimpression which Seward made on his colleagues in the first days of the\r\nnew Government has been thus sharply recorded by Welles: \"The Secretary\r\nof State was, of course, apprised of every meeting [of ministers] and\r\nnever failed in his attendance, whatever was the subject-matter,\r\nand though entirely out of his official province. He was vigilantly\r\nattentive to every measure and movement in other Departments, however\r\ntrivial--as much so as to his own--watched and scrutinized every\r\nappointment that was made, or proposed to be made, but was not\r\ncommunicative in regard to the transaction of the State Department.\"\r\nSo eager was Seward to keep all the threads of affairs in his own hands\r\nthat he tried to persuade Lincoln not to hold cabinet meetings but\r\nmerely to consult with particular ministers, and with the Secretary\r\nof State, as occasion might demand. A combined protest from the other\r\nSecretaries, however, caused the regular holding of Cabinet meetings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Confederacy, Seward's policy was one of\r\nnon-resistance. For this he had two reasons. The first of these was\r\nhis rooted delusion that the bulk of the Southerners were opposed to\r\nsecession and, if let alone, would force their leaders to reconsider\r\ntheir action. He might have quoted the nursery rhyme, \"Let them alone\r\nand they'll come home\"; it would have been like him and in tune with\r\na frivolous side of his nature. He was quite as irresponsible when he\r\ncomplacently assured the North that the trouble would all blow over\r\nwithin ninety days. He also believed that any display of force would\r\nconvert these hypothetical Unionists of the South from friends to\r\nenemies and would consolidate opinion in the Confederacy to produce\r\nwar. In justice to Seward it must be remembered that on this point time\r\njustified his fears.\r\n\r\nHis dealings with the Confederate commissioners show that he was playing\r\nto gain time, not with intent to deceive the Southerners but to acquire\r\nthat domination over Lincoln which he felt was his by natural right.\r\nIntending to institute a peace policy the moment he gained this\r\nascendency, he felt perfectly safe in making promises to the\r\ncommissioners through mutual friends. He virtually told them that Sumter\r\nwould eventually be given up and that all they need do was to wait.\r\n\r\nSeward brought to bear upon the President the opinions of various\r\nmilitary men who thought the time had passed when any expedition for the\r\nrelief of Sumter could succeed. For some time Lincoln seemed about\r\nto consent, though reluctantly, to Seward's lead in the matter of the\r\nforts. He was pulled up standing, however, by the threatened resignation\r\nof the Postmaster-General, Blair. After a conference with leading\r\nRepublican politicians the President announced to his Cabinet that\r\nhis policy would include the relief of Sumter. \"Seward,\" says Welles,\r\n\"...was evidently displeased.\"\r\n\r\nSeward now took a new tack. Fort Pickens, at Pensacola, was a problem\r\nsimilar to that of Sumter at Charleston. Both were demanded by the\r\nConfederates, and both were in need of supplies. But Fort Pickens lay\r\nto one side, so to speak, of the public mind, and there was not\r\nconspicuously in the world's eye the square issue over it that there\r\nwas over Sumter. Seward conceived the idea that, if the President's\r\nattention were diverted from Sumter to Pickens and a relief expedition\r\nwere sent to the latter but none to the former, his private negotiations\r\nwith the Confederates might still be kept going; Lincoln might yet be\r\nhypnotized; and at last all would be well.\r\n\r\nOn All-Fools' Day, 1861, in the midst of a press of business, he\r\nobtained Lincoln's signature to some dispatches, which Lincoln, it\r\nseems, discussed with him hurriedly and without detailed consideration.\r\nThere were now in preparation two relief expeditions, one to carry\r\nsupplies to Pensacola, the other to Charleston. Neither was to fight\r\nif it was not molested. Both were to be strong enough to fight if\r\ntheir commanders deemed it necessary. As flagship of the Charleston\r\nexpedition, Welles had detailed the powerful warship Powhatan, which\r\nwas rapidly being made ready at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Such was the\r\nsituation as Welles understood it when he was thinking of bed late on\r\nthe night of the 6th of April. Until then he had not suspected that\r\nthere was doubt and bewilderment about the Powhatan at Brooklyn. One\r\nof those dispatches which Lincoln had so hastily signed provided for\r\ndetaching the Powhatan from the Charleston expedition and sending it\r\nsafe out of harm's way to Pensacola. The commander of the ship had\r\nbefore him the conflicting orders, one from the President, one from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy. He was about to sail under the President's\r\norders for Pensacola; but wishing to make sure of his authority, he\r\nhad telegraphed to Washington. Gideon Welles was a pugnacious man. His\r\ndislike for Seward was deepseated. Imagine his state of mind when it was\r\naccidently revealed to him that Seward had gone behind his back and had\r\nissued to naval officers orders which were contradictory to his own!\r\nThe immediate result was an interview that same night between Seward and\r\nWelles in which, as Welles coldly admitted in after days, the Secretary\r\nof the Navy showed \"some excitement.\" Together they went, about\r\nmidnight, to the White House. Lincoln had some difficulty recalling the\r\nincident of the dispatch on the 1st of April; but when he did remember,\r\nhe took the responsibility entirely upon himself, saying he had had\r\nno purpose but to strengthen the Pickens expedition, and no thought of\r\nweakening the expedition to Charleston. He directed Seward to telegraph\r\nimmediately cancelling the order detaching the Powhatan. Seward made a\r\ndesperate attempt to put him off, protesting, it was too late to send\r\na telegram that night. \"But the President was imperative,\" writes\r\nSecretary Welles, in describing the incident, and a dispatch was sent.\r\n\r\nSeward then, doubtless in his agitation, did a strange thing. Instead\r\nof telegraphing in the President's name, the dispatch which he sent read\r\nmerely, \"Give up the Powhatan...Seward.\" When this dispatch was received\r\nat Brooklyn, the Powhatan was already under way and had to be overtaken\r\nby a fast tug. In the eyes of her commander, however, a personal\r\ntelegram from the Secretary of State appeared as of no weight against\r\nthe official orders of the President, and he continued his voyage to\r\nPensacola.\r\n\r\nThe mercurial temper of Seward comes out even in the caustic narrative\r\nwritten afterwards by Welles. Evidently Seward was deeply mortified and\r\ndepressed by the incident. He remarked, says Welles, that old as he was\r\nhe had learned a lesson, and that was that he had better attend to his\r\nown business. \"To this,\" commented his enemy, \"I cordially assented.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless Seward's loss of faith in himself was only momentary. A\r\nnight's sleep was sufficient to restore it. His next communication to\r\nthe commissioners shows that he was himself again, sure that destiny\r\nowed him the control of the situation. On the following day the\r\ncommissioners had got wind of the relief expedition and pressed him for\r\ninformation, recalling his assurance that nothing would be done to their\r\ndisadvantage. In reply, still through a third person, Seward sent them\r\nthe famous message, over the precise meaning of which great debate has\r\nraged: \"Faith as to Sumter fully kept; wait and see.\" If this infatuated\r\ndreamer still believed he could dominate Lincoln, still hoped at the\r\nlast moment to arrest the expedition to Charleston, he was doomed to\r\nbitterest disappointment.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April, the expedition to Fort Sumter sailed, but without,\r\nas we have seen, the assistance of the much needed warship, the\r\nPowhatan. As all the world knows, the expedition had been too long\r\ndelayed and it accomplished nothing. Before it arrived, the surrender\r\nof Sumter had been demanded and refused--and war had begun. During the\r\nbombardment of Sumter, the relief expedition appeared beyond the bar,\r\nbut its commander had no vessels of such a character as to enable him\r\nto carry aid to the fortress. Furthermore, he had not been informed that\r\nthe Powhatan had been detached from his squadron, and he expected to\r\nmeet her at the mouth of the harbor. There his ships lay idle until the\r\nfort was surrendered, waiting for the Powhatan--for whose detachment\r\nfrom the squadron Seward was responsible.\r\n\r\nTo return to the world of intrigue at Washington, however, it must not\r\nbe supposed, as is so often done, that Fort Sumter was the one concern\r\nof the new government during its first six weeks. In fact, the subject\r\noccupied but a fraction of Lincoln's time. Scarcely second in importance\r\nwas that matter so curiously bound up with the relief of the forts--the\r\ngetting in hand of the strangely vain glorious Secretary of State.\r\nMention has already been made of All-Fools' Day, 1861. Several marvelous\r\nthings took place on that day. Strangest of all was the presentation of\r\na paper by the Secretary of State to his chief, entitled \"Thoughts for\r\nthe President's Consideration\". Whether it be regarded as a state paper\r\nor as a biographical detail in the career of Seward, it proves to be\r\nquite the most astounding thing in the whole episode. The \"Thoughts\"\r\noutlined a course of policy by which the buoyant Secretary intended to\r\nmake good his prophecy of domestic peace within ninety days. Besides\r\ncalmly patronizing Lincoln, assuring him that his lack of \"a policy\r\neither domestic or foreign\" was \"not culpable and... even unavoidable,\"\r\nthe paper warned him that \"policies...both domestic and foreign\" must\r\nimmediately be adopted, and it proceeded to point out what they ought to\r\nbe. Briefly stated, the one true policy which he advocated at home was\r\nto evacuate Sumter (though Pickens for some unexplained reason might be\r\nsafely retained) and then, in order to bring the Southerners back into\r\nthe Union, to pick quarrels with both Spain and France; to proceed as\r\nquickly as possible to war with both powers; and to have the ultimate\r\nsatisfaction of beholding the reunion of the country through the general\r\nenthusiasm that was bound to come. Finally, the paper intimated that the\r\nSecretary of State was the man to carry this project through to success.\r\n\r\nAll this is not opera bouffe, but serious history. It must have taxed\r\nLincoln's sense of humor and strained his sense of the fitness of things\r\nto treat such nonsense with the tactful forbearance which he showed and\r\nto relegate it to the pigeonhole without making Seward angry. Yet this\r\nhe contrived to do; and he also managed, gently but firmly, to make it\r\nplain that the President intended to exercise his authority as the chief\r\nmagistrate of the nation. His forbearance was further shown in passing\r\nover without rebuke Seward's part in the affair of Sumter, which might\r\nso easily have been made to appear treacherous, and in shouldering\r\nhimself with all responsibility for the failure of the Charleston\r\nexpedition. In the wave of excitement following the surrender, even so\r\ndebonair a minister as Seward must have realized how fortunate it was\r\nfor him that his chief did not tell all he knew. About this time Seward\r\nbegan to perceive that Lincoln had a will of his own, and that it was\r\nnot safe to trifle further with the President. Seward thereupon ceased\r\nhis interference.\r\n\r\nIt was in the dark days preceding the fall of Sumter that a crowd of\r\noffice-seekers gathered at Washington, most of them men who had little\r\ninterest in anything but the spoils. It is a distressing commentary on\r\nthe American party system that, during the most critical month of the\r\nmost critical period of American history, much of the President's time\r\nwas consumed by these political vampires who would not be put off, even\r\nthough a revolution was in progress and nations, perhaps, were dying\r\nand being born. \"The scramble for office,\" wrote Stanton, \"is\r\nterrible.\" Seward noted privately: \"Solicitants for office besiege the\r\nPresident.... My duties call me to the White House two or three times a\r\nday. The grounds, halls, stairways, closets, are filled with applicants\r\nwho render ingress and egress difficult.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Welles has etched the Washington of that time in his coldly\r\nscornful way:\r\n\r\n\"A strange state of things existed at that time in Washington.\r\nThe atmosphere was thick with treason. Party spirit and old party\r\ndifferences prevailed, however, amidst these accumulated dangers.\r\nSecession was considered by most persons as a political party question,\r\nnot as rebellion. Democrats to a large extent sympathized with the\r\nRebels more than with the Administration, which they opposed, not that\r\nthey wished Secession to be successful and the Union divided, but they\r\nhoped that President Lincoln and the Republicans would, overwhelmed by\r\nobstacles and embarrassments, prove failures. The Republicans on the\r\nother hand, were scarcely less partisan and unreasonable. Patriotism was\r\nwith them no test, no shield from party malevolence. They demanded\r\nthe proscription and exclusion of such Democrats as opposed the Rebel\r\nmovement and clung to the Union, with the same vehemence that they\r\ndemanded the removal of the worst Rebels who advocated a dissolution of\r\nthe Union. Neither party appeared to be apprehensive of, or to realize\r\nthe gathering storm.\"\r\n\r\nSeen against such a background, the political and diplomatic frivolity\r\nof the Secretary of State is not so inexplicable as it would otherwise\r\nbe. This background, as well as the intrigue of the Secretary, helps\r\nus to understand Lincoln's great task inside his Cabinet. At first the\r\nCabinet was a group of jealous politicians new to this sort of office,\r\ndrawn from different parties, and totally lacking in a cordial sense\r\nof previous action together. None of them, probably, when they first\r\nassembled had any high opinion of their titular head. He was looked upon\r\nas a political makeshift. The best of them had to learn to appreciate\r\nthe fact that this strange, ungainly man, sprung from plainest origin,\r\nwithout formal education, was a great genius. By degrees, however, the\r\nlarge minds in the Cabinet became his cordial admirers. While Lincoln\r\nwas quietly, gradually exercising his strong will upon Seward, he was\r\ndoing the same with the other members of his council. Presently they\r\nawoke--the majority of them at least--to the truth that he, for all his\r\nodd ways, was their master.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the gradual readjustment of all factions in the North was\r\nsteadily going forward. The Republicans were falling into line behind\r\nthe Government; and by degrees the distinction between Seward and\r\nLincoln, in the popular mind, faded into a sort of composite picture\r\ncalled \"the Administration.\" Lincoln had the reward of his long\r\nforbearance with his Secretary. For Seward it must be said that, however\r\nhe had intrigued against his chief at Washington, he did not intrigue\r\nwith the country. Admitting as he had, too, that he had met his master,\r\nhe took the defeat as a good sportsman and threw all his vast party\r\ninfluence into the scale for Lincoln's fortunes. Thus, as April wore on,\r\nthe Republican party settled down to the idea that it was to follow the\r\nGovernment at Washington upon any course that might develop.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats in the North were anti-Southern in larger proportion,\r\nprobably, than at any other time during the struggle of the sections.\r\nWe have seen that numbers of them had frankly declared for the Union.\r\nPolitics had proved weaker than propinquity. There was a moment when it\r\nseemed--delusively, as events proved--that the North was united as one\r\nman to oppose the South.\r\n\r\nThere is surely not another day in our history that has witnessed so\r\nmuch nervous tension as Saturday, April 13, 1861, for on that morning\r\nthe newspapers electrified the North with the news that Sumter had been\r\nfired on from Confederate batteries on the shore of Charleston Harbor.\r\nIn the South the issue was awaited confidently, but many minds at\r\nleast were in that state of awed suspense natural to a moment which the\r\nthoughtful see is the stroke of fate. In the North, the day passed for\r\nthe most part in a quiet so breathless that even the most careless could\r\nhave foretold the storm which broke on the following day. The account\r\nof this crisis which has been given by Lincoln's private secretary is\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n\"That day there was little change in the business routine of the\r\nExecutive office. Mr. Lincoln was never liable to sudden excitement\r\nor sudden activity.... So while the Sumter telegrams were on every\r\ntongue...leading men and officials called to learn or impart the news.\r\nThe Cabinet, as by common impulse, came together and deliberated. All\r\ntalk, however, was brief, sententious, formal. Lincoln said but little\r\nbeyond making inquiries about the current reports and criticizing the\r\nprobability or accuracy of their details, and went on as usual\r\nreceiving visitors, listening to suggestions, and signing routine papers\r\nthroughout the day.\" Meanwhile the cannon were booming at Charleston.\r\nThe people came out on the sea-front of the lovely old city and watched\r\nthe duel of the cannon far down the harbor, and spoke joyously of the\r\ngreat event. They saw the shells of the shore batteries ignite\r\nportions of the fortress on the island. They watched the fire of the\r\ndefenders--driven by the flames into a restricted area--slacken and\r\ncease. At last the flag of the Union fluttered down from above Fort\r\nSumter.\r\n\r\nWhen the news flashed over the North, early Sunday morning, April 14th,\r\nthe tension broke. For many observers then and afterward, the only North\r\ndiscernible that fateful Sabbath was an enraged, defiant, impulsive\r\nnation, forgetful for the moment of all its differences, and uniting all\r\nits voices in one hoarse cry for vengeance. There seemed to be no other\r\nthought. Lincoln gave it formal utterance, that same day, by assembling\r\nhis Cabinet and drawing up a proclamation which called for 75,000\r\nvolunteer troops.\r\n\r\nAn incident of this day which is as significant historically as any\r\nother was on the surface no more than a friendly talk between two men.\r\nDouglas called at the White House. For nearly two hours he and Lincoln\r\nconferred in private. Hitherto it had been a little uncertain what\r\ncourse Douglas was going to take. In the Senate, though condemning\r\ndisunion, he had opposed war. Few matters can have troubled Lincoln more\r\ndeeply than the question which way Douglas's immense influence would be\r\nthrown. The question was answered publicly in the newspapers of Monday,\r\nApril 15th. Douglas announced that while he was still \"unalterably\r\nopposed to the Administration on all its political issues, he\r\nwas prepared to sustain the President in the exercise of all his\r\nconstitutional functions to preserve the Union, and maintain the\r\nGovernment, and defend the federal capital.\"\r\n\r\nThere remained of Douglas's life but a few months. The time was filled\r\nwith earnest speechmaking in support of the Government. He had started\r\nWest directly following his conference with Lincoln. His speeches in\r\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, were perhaps the greatest single force in\r\nbreaking up his own following, putting an end to the principle of doing\r\nnothing, and forcing every Democrat to come out and show his colors.\r\nIn Shakespeare's phrase, it was--\"Under which king, Bezonian? speak or\r\ndie!\" In Douglas's own phrase: \"There can be no neutrals in this war;\r\nONLY PATRIOTS--OR TRAITORS.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side with Douglas's manifesto to the Democrats there appeared in\r\nthe Monday papers Lincoln's call for volunteers. The militia of several\r\nNorthern States at once responded.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 17th of April, the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment\r\nentrained for Washington. Two days later it was in Baltimore. There it\r\nwas attacked by a mob; the soldiers fired; and a number of civilians\r\nwere killed as well as several soldiers.\r\n\r\nThese shots at Baltimore aroused the Southern party in Maryland. Led\r\nby the Mayor of the city, they resolved to prevent the passage of other\r\ntroops across their State to Washington. Railway tracks were torn up\r\nby order of the municipal authorities, and bridges were burnt. The\r\ntelegraph was cut. As in a flash, after issuing his proclamation,\r\nLincoln found himself isolated at Washington with no force but a handful\r\nof troops and the government clerks. And while Maryland rose against him\r\non one side, Virginia joined his enemies on the other. The day the Sixth\r\nMassachusetts left Boston, Virginia seceded. The Virginia militia were\r\ncalled to their colors. Preparations were at once set on foot for the\r\nseizure of the great federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry and the Navy Yard\r\nat Norfolk. The next day a handful of federal troops, fearful of being\r\noverpowered at Harper's Ferry, burned the arsenal and withdrew to\r\nWashington. For the same reason the buildings of the great Navy Yard\r\nwere blown up or set on fire, and the ships at anchor were sunk. So\r\ndesperate and unprepared were the Washington authorities that they took\r\nthese extreme measures to keep arms and ammunition out of the hands of\r\nthe Virginians. So hastily was the destruction carried out, that it was\r\nonly partially successful and at both places large stores of ammunition\r\nwere seized by the Virginia troops. While Washington was isolated,\r\nand Lincoln did not know what response the North had made to his\r\nproclamation, Robert E. Lee, having resigned his commission in the\r\nfederal army, was placed in command of the Virginia troops.\r\n\r\nThe secretaries of Lincoln have preserved a picture of his desperate\r\nanxiety, waiting, day after day, for relief from the North which\r\nhe hoped would speedily come by sea. Outwardly he maintained his\r\nself-control. But once, on the afternoon of the 23d, the business of\r\nthe day being over, the Executive office being deserted, after walking\r\nthe floor alone in silent thought for nearly half an hour, he stopped\r\nand gazed long and wistfully out of the window down the Potomac in the\r\ndirection of the expected ships; and, unconscious of other presence in\r\nthe room, at length broke out with irrepressible anguish in the repeated\r\nexclamation, \"Why don't they come! Why don't they come!\"\r\n\r\nDuring these days of isolation, when Washington, with the telegraph\r\ninoperative, was kept in an appalling uncertainty, the North rose.\r\nThere was literally a rush to volunteer. \"The heather is on fire,\" wrote\r\nGeorge Ticknor, \"I never before knew what a popular excitement can\r\nbe.\" As fast as possible militia were hurried South. The crack New York\r\nregiment, the famous, dandified Seventh, started for the front amid\r\nprobably the most tempestuous ovation which until that time was ever\r\ngiven to a military organization in America. Of the march of the\r\nregiment down Broadway, one of its members wrote, \"Only one who passed\r\nas we did, through the tempest of cheers two miles long, can know the\r\nterrible enthusiasm of the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nTo reach Washington by rail was impossible. The Seventh went by boat\r\nto Annapolis. The same course was taken by a regiment of Massachusetts\r\nmechanics, the Eighth. Landing at Annapolis, the two regiments, dandies\r\nand laborers, fraternized at once in the common bond of loyalty to the\r\nUnion. A branch railway led from Annapolis to the main line between\r\nWashington and Baltimore. The rails had been torn up. The Massachusetts\r\nmechanics set to work to relay them. The Governor of Maryland protested.\r\nHe was disregarded. The two regiments toiled together a long day and\r\nthrough the night following, between Annapolis and the Washington\r\njunction, bringing on their baggage and cannon over relaid tracks.\r\nThere, a train was found which the Seventh appropriated. At noon, on\r\nthe 25th of April, that advance guard of the Northern hosts entered\r\nWashington, and Lincoln knew that he had armies behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. LINCOLN\r\n\r\nThe history of the North had virtually become, by April, 1861, the\r\nhistory of Lincoln himself, and during the remaining four years of the\r\nPresident's life it is difficult to separate his personality from the\r\ntrend of national history. Any attempt to understand the achievements\r\nand the omissions of the Northern people without undertaking an\r\nintelligent estimate of their leader would be only to duplicate the\r\nstory of \"Hamlet\" with Hamlet left out. According to the opinion of\r\nEnglish military experts*, \"Against the great military genius of certain\r\nSouthern leaders fate opposed the unbroken resolution and passionate\r\ndevotion to the Union, which he worshiped, of the great Northern\r\nPresident. As long as he lived and ruled the people of the North, there\r\ncould be no turning back.\"\r\n\r\n     * Wood and Edmonds. \"The Civil War in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln has been ranked with Socrates; but he has also been compared\r\nwith Rabelais. He has been the target of abuse that knew no mercy; but\r\nhe has been worshiped as a demigod. The ten big volumes of his official\r\nbiography are a sustained, intemperate eulogy in which the hero does\r\nnothing that is not admirable; but as large a book could be built up\r\nout of contemporaneous Northern writings that would paint a picture of\r\nunmitigated blackness--and the most eloquent portions of it would be\r\nsigned by Wendell Phillips.\r\n\r\nThe real Lincoln is, of course, neither the Lincoln of the official\r\nbiography nor the Lincoln of Wendell Phillips. He was neither a saint\r\nnor a villain. What he actually was is not, however, so easily stated.\r\nProdigious men are never easy to sum up; and Lincoln was a prodigious\r\nman. The more one studies him, the more individual he appears to be. By\r\ndegrees one comes to understand how it was possible for contemporaries\r\nto hold contradictory views of him and for each to believe frantically\r\nthat his views were proved by facts. For anyone who thinks he can hit\r\noff in a few neat generalities this complex, extraordinary personality,\r\na single warning may suffice. Walt Whitman, who was perhaps the most\r\noriginal thinker and the most acute observer who ever saw Lincoln face\r\nto face has left us his impression; but he adds that there was something\r\nin Lincoln's face which defied description and which no picture had\r\ncaught. After Whitman's conclusion that \"One of the great portrait\r\npainters of two or three hundred years ago is needed,\" the mere\r\nhistorian should proceed with caution.\r\n\r\nThere is historic significance in his very appearance. His huge,\r\nloose-knit figure, six feet four inches high, lean, muscular, ungainly,\r\nthe evidence of his great physical strength, was a fit symbol of those\r\nhard workers, the children of the soil, from whom he sprang. His face\r\nwas rugged like his figure, the complexion swarthy, cheek bones high,\r\nand bushy black hair crowning a great forehead beneath which the eyes\r\nwere deep-set, gray, and dreaming. A sort of shambling powerfulness\r\nformed the main suggestion of face and figure, softened strangely by the\r\nmysterious expression of the eyes, and by the singular delicacy of the\r\nskin. The motions of this awkward giant lacked grace; the top hat and\r\nblack frock coat, sometimes rusty, which had served him on the western\r\ncircuit continued to serve him when he was virtually the dictator of his\r\ncountry. It was in such dress that he visited the army, where he towered\r\nabove his generals.\r\n\r\nEven in a book of restricted scope, such as this, one must insist upon\r\nthe distinction between the private and public Lincoln, for there is\r\nas yet no accepted conception of him. What comes nearest to an accepted\r\nconception is contained probably in the version of the late Charles\r\nFrancis Adams. He tells us how his father, the elder Charles Francis\r\nAdams, ambassador to London, found Lincoln in 1861 an offensive\r\npersonality, and he insists that Lincoln under strain passed through a\r\ntransformation which made the Lincoln of 1864 a different man from the\r\nLincoln of 1861. Perhaps; but without being frivolous, one is tempted\r\nto quote certain old-fashioned American papers that used to label their\r\nnews items \"important if true.\"\r\n\r\nWhat then, was the public Lincoln? What explains his vast success? As\r\na force in American history, what does he count for? Perhaps the most\r\nsignificant detail in an answer to these questions is the fact that he\r\nhad never held conspicuous public office until at the age of fifty-two\r\nhe became President. Psychologically his place is in that small group of\r\ngreat geniuses whose whole significant period lies in what we commonly\r\nthink of as the decline of life. There are several such in history:\r\nRome had Caesar; America had both Lincoln and Lee. By contrasting these\r\ninstances with those of the other type, the egoistic geniuses such as\r\nAlexander or Napoleon, we become aware of some dim but profound dividing\r\nline separating the two groups. The theory that genius, at bottom, is\r\npure energy seems to fit Napoleon; but does it fit these other minds who\r\nappear to meet life with a certain indifference, with a carelessness of\r\ntheir own fate, a willingness to leave much to chance? That irresistible\r\npassion for authority which Napoleon had is lacking in these others.\r\nTheir basal inspiration seems to resemble the impulse of the artist to\r\nexpress, rather than the impulse of the man of action to possess. Had\r\nit not been for secession, Lee would probably have ended his days as an\r\nexemplary superintendent of West Point. And what of Lincoln? He dabbled\r\nin politics, early and without success; he left politics for the law,\r\nand to the law he gave during many years his chief devotion. But the\r\nfortuitous break-up of parties, with the revival of the slavery issue,\r\ntouched some hidden spring; the able provincial lawyer felt again the\r\npolitical impulse; he became a famous maker of political phrases; and on\r\nthis literary basis he became the leader of a party.\r\n\r\nToo little attention has been paid to this progression of Lincoln\r\nthrough literature into politics. The ease with which he drifted from\r\none to the other is also still to be evaluated. Did it show a certain\r\nslackness, a certain aimlessness, at the bottom of his nature? Had\r\nit, in a way, some sort of analogy--to compare homespun with things\r\nOlympian--to the vein of frivolity in the great Caesar? One is\r\ntempted to think so. Surely, here was one of those natures which need\r\ncircumstance to compel them to greatness and which are not foredoomed,\r\nNapoleon-like, to seize greatness. Without encroaching upon the\r\nbiographical task, one may borrow from biography this insistent echo:\r\nthe anecdotes of Lincoln sound over and over the note of easy-going good\r\nnature; but there is to be found in many of the Lincoln anecdotes an\r\novertone of melancholy which lingers after one's impression of his good\r\nnature. Quite naturally, in such a biographical atmosphere, we find\r\nourselves thinking of him at first as a little too good-humored, a\r\nlittle too easy-going, a little prone to fall into reverie. We are not\r\nsurprised when we find his favorite poem beginning \"Oh, why should the\r\nspirit of mortal be proud.\"\r\n\r\nThis enigmatical man became President in his fifty-second year. We\r\nhave already seen that his next period, the winter of 1860-61, has its\r\nbiographical problems. The impression which he made on the country as\r\nPresident-elect was distinctly unfavorable. Good humor, or opportunism,\r\nor what you will, brought together in Lincoln's Cabinet at least three\r\nmen more conspicuous in the ordinary sense than he was himself. We\r\nforget, today, how insignificant he must have seemed in a Cabinet that\r\nembraced Seward, Cameron, and Chase--all large national figures. What\r\nwould not history give for a page of self-revelation showing us how he\r\nfelt in the early days of that company! Was he troubled? Did he doubt\r\nhis ability to hold his own? Was he fatalistic? Was his sad smile his\r\nrefuge? Did he merely put things by, ignoring tomorrow until tomorrow\r\nshould arrive?\r\n\r\nHowever we may guess at the answers to such questions, one thing now\r\nbecomes certain. His quality of good humor began to be his salvation.\r\nIt is doubtful if any President except Washington had to manage so\r\ndifficult a Cabinet. Washington had seen no solution to the problem but\r\nto let Jefferson go. Lincoln found his Cabinet often on the verge of a\r\nsplit, with two powerful factions struggling to control it and neither\r\never gaining full control. Though there were numerous withdrawals, no\r\nresigning secretary really split Lincoln's Cabinet. By what turns and\r\ntwists and skillful maneuvers Lincoln prevented such a division and\r\nkept such inveterate enemies as Chase and Seward steadily at their\r\njobs--Chase during three years, Seward to the end--will partly appear\r\nin the following pages; but the whole delicate achievement cannot be\r\nproperly appreciated except in detailed biography.\r\n\r\nAll criticism of Lincoln turns eventually on one question: Was he an\r\nopportunist? Not only his enemies in his own time but many politicians\r\nof a later day were eager to prove that he was the latter--indeed,\r\nseeking to shelter their own opportunism behind the majesty of his\r\nexample. A modern instance will perhaps make vivid this long standing\r\ndebate upon Lincoln and his motives. Merely for historic illumination\r\nand without becoming invidious, we may recall the instance of President\r\nWilson and the resignation of his Secretary of War in 1916 because\r\nCongress would not meet the issue of preparedness. The President\r\naccepted the resignation without forcing the issue, and Congress went\r\non fiddling while Rome burned. Now, was the President an opportunist,\r\nmerely waiting to see what course events would take, or was he a\r\npolitical strategist, astutely biding his time? Similar in character\r\nis this old debate upon Lincoln, which is perhaps best focussed in the\r\nremoval of Secretary Blair which we shall have to note in connection\r\nwith the election of 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the most objective historian to deal with such\r\nquestions without obtruding his personal views, but there is nothing\r\nmerely individual in recording the fact that the steady drift of opinion\r\nhas been away from the conception of Lincoln as an opportunist. What\r\nonce caused him to be thus conceived appears now to have been a failure\r\nto comprehend intelligently the nature of his undertaking. More and\r\nmore, the tendency nowadays is to conceive his career as one of\r\nthose few instances in which the precise faculties needed to solve a\r\nparticular problem were called into play at exactly the critical moment.\r\nOur confusions with regard to Lincoln have grown out of our failure\r\nto appreciate the singularity of the American people, and their\r\nultra-singularity during the years in which he lived. It remains to be\r\nseen hereafter what strange elements of sensibility, of waywardness,\r\nof lack of imagination, of undisciplined ardor, of selfishness, of\r\ndeceitfulness, of treachery, combined with heroic ideality, made up\r\nthe character of that complex populace which it was Lincoln's task to\r\ncontrol. But he did more than control it: he somehow compounded much of\r\nit into something like a unit. To measure Lincoln's achievement in this\r\nrespect, two things must be remembered: on the one hand, his task was\r\nnot as arduous as it might have been, because the most intellectual part\r\nof the North had definitely committed itself either irretrievably for,\r\nor irreconcilably against, his policy. Lincoln, therefore, did not have\r\nto trouble himself with this portion of the population. On the\r\nother hand, that part which he had to master included such emotional\r\nrhetoricians as Horace Greeley; such fierce zealots as Henry Winter\r\nDavis of Maryland, who made him trouble indeed, and Benjamin Wade, whom\r\nwe have met already; such military egoists as McClellan and Pope; such\r\ncrafty double-dealers as his own Secretary of the Treasury; such astute\r\ngrafters as Cameron; such miserable creatures as certain powerful\r\ncapitalists who sacrificed his army to their own lust for profits\r\nfilched from army contracts.\r\n\r\nThe wonder of Lincoln's achievement is that he contrived at last to\r\nextend his hold over all these diverse elements; that he persuaded some,\r\noutwitted others, and overcame them all. The subtlety of this task would\r\nhave ruined any statesman of the driving sort. Explain Lincoln by any\r\ntheory you will, his personality was the keystone of the Northern arch;\r\nsubtract it, and the arch falls. The popular element being as complex\r\nand powerful as it was, how could the presiding statesman have mastered\r\nthe situation if he had not been of so peculiar a sort that he could\r\ninfluence all these diverse and powerful interests, slowly, by degrees,\r\nwithout heat, without the imperative note, almost in silence, with the\r\nuniversal, enfolding irresistibility of the gradual things in nature,\r\nof the sun and the rain. Such was the genius of Lincoln--all but\r\npassionless, yet so quiet that one cannot but believe in the great depth\r\nof his nature.\r\n\r\nWe are, even today, far from a definitive understanding of Lincoln's\r\nstatecraft, but there is perhaps justification for venturing upon one\r\nprophecy. The farther from him we get and the more clearly we see him in\r\nperspective, the more we shall realize his creative influence upon his\r\nparty. A Lincoln who is the moulder of events and the great creator of\r\npublic opinion will emerge at last into clear view. In the Lincoln\r\nof his ultimate biographer there will be more of iron than of a less\r\nenduring metal in the figure of the Lincoln of present tradition. Though\r\nnone of his gentleness will disappear, there will be more emphasis\r\nplaced upon his firmness, and upon such episodes as that of December,\r\n1860, when his single will turned the scale against compromise; upon\r\nhis steadiness in the defeat of his party at the polls in 1862; or his\r\noverruling of the will of Congress in the summer of 1864 on the question\r\nof reconstruction; or his attitude in the autumn of that year when\r\nhe believed that he was losing his second election. Behind all his\r\ngentleness, his slowness, behind his sadness, there will eventually\r\nappear an inflexible purpose, strong as steel, unwavering as fate.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was in truth Lincoln's war. Those modern pacifists who\r\nclaim him for their own are beside the mark. They will never get over\r\ntheir illusions about Lincoln until they see, as all the world is\r\nbeginning to see, that his career has universal significance because of\r\nits bearing on the universal modern problem of democracy. It will not do\r\never to forget that he was a man of the people, always playing the hand\r\nof the people, in the limited social sense of that word, though playing\r\nit with none of the heat usually met with in the statesmen of successful\r\ndemocracy from Cleon to Robespierre, from Andrew Jackson to Lloyd\r\nGeorge. His gentleness does not remove Lincoln from that stern category.\r\nThroughout his life, besides his passion for the Union, besides his\r\nantipathy to slavery, there dwelt in his very heart love of and faith\r\nin the plain people. We shall never see him in true historic perspective\r\nuntil we conceive him as the instrument of a vast social idea--the\r\ndetermination to make a government based on the plain people successful\r\nin war.\r\n\r\nHe did not scruple to seize power when he thought the cause of the\r\npeople demanded it, and his enemies were prompt to accuse him of holding\r\nto the doctrine that the end justified the means--a hasty conclusion\r\nwhich will have to be reconsidered; what concerns us more closely is the\r\ndefinite conviction that he felt no sacrifice too great if it advanced\r\nthe happiness of the generality of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe final significance of Lincoln as a statesman of democracy is brought\r\nout most clearly in his foreign relations. Fate put it into the hands of\r\nEngland to determine whether his Government should stand or fall. Though\r\nit is doubtful how far the turning of the scale of English policy in\r\nLincoln's favor was due to the influence of the rising power of English\r\ndemocracy, it is plain that Lincoln thought of himself as having one\r\npurpose with that movement which he regarded as an ally. Beyond all\r\ndoubt among the most grateful messages he ever received were the New\r\nYear greetings of confidence and sympathy which were sent by English\r\nworkingmen in 1863. A few sentences in his \"Letter to the Workingmen\r\nof London\" help us to look through his eyes and see his life and its\r\nstruggles as they appeared to him in relation to world history:\r\n\r\n\"As these sentiments [expressed by the English workmen] are manifestly\r\nthe enduring support of the free institutions of England, so am I sure\r\nthat they constitute the only reliable basis for free institutions\r\nthroughout the world.... The resources, advantages, and power of the\r\nAmerican people are very great, and they have consequently succeeded to\r\nequally great responsibilities. It seems to have devolved upon them to\r\ntest whether a government established on the principles of human freedom\r\ncan be maintained against an effort to build one upon the exclusive\r\nfoundation of human bondage. They will rejoice with me in the new\r\nevidence which your proceedings furnish that the magnanimity they\r\nare exhibiting is justly estimated by the true friends of freedom and\r\nhumanity in foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nWritten at the opening of that terrible year, 1863, these words are a\r\nforward link with those more celebrated words spoken toward its close\r\nat Gettysburg. Perhaps at no time during the war, except during the few\r\ndays immediately following his own reelection a year later, did Lincoln\r\ncome so near being free from care as then. Perhaps that explains why\r\nhis fundamental literary power reasserted itself so remarkably, why this\r\nspeech of his at the dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg\r\non the 19th of November, 1863, remains one of the most memorable\r\norations ever delivered:\r\n\r\n\"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this\r\ncontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,\r\nor any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met\r\non a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion\r\nof that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their\r\nlives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper\r\nthat we should do this.\r\n\r\n\"But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we\r\ncannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled\r\nhere, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The\r\nworld will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to\r\nbe dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have\r\nthus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to\r\nthe great task remaining before us: that from these honored dead we\r\ntake increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full\r\nmeasure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall\r\nnot have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new\r\nbirth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and\r\nfor the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE RULE OF LINCOLN\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem of the Lincoln Government was the raising of\r\narmies, the sudden conversion of a community which was essentially\r\nindustrial into a disciplined military organization. The accomplishment\r\nof so gigantic a transformation taxed the abilities of two Secretaries\r\nof War. The first, Simon Cameron, owed his place in the Cabinet to\r\nthe double fact of being one of the ablest of political bosses and\r\nof standing high among Lincoln's competitors for the Presidential\r\nnomination. Personally honest, he was also a political cynic to whom\r\ntradition ascribes the epigram defining an honest politician as one who\r\n\"when he is bought, will stay bought.\" As Secretary of War he showed no\r\nparticular ability.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when the tide of enthusiasm was in flood, and volunteers\r\nin hosts were responding to acts of Congress for the raising and\r\nmaintenance of a volunteer army, Cameron reported in December that the\r\nGovernment had on foot 660,971 men and could have had a million except\r\nthat Congress had limited the number of volunteers to be received. When\r\nthis report was prepared, Lincoln was, so to speak, in the trough of two\r\nseas. The devotion which had been offered to him in April, 1861, when\r\nthe North seemed to rise as one man, had undergone a reaction. Eight\r\nmonths without a single striking military success, together with\r\nthe startling defeat at Bull Run, had had their inevitable effect.\r\nDemocracies are mercurial; variability seems to be part of the price of\r\nfreedom. With childlike faith in their cause, the Northern people,\r\nin midsummer, were crying, \"On to Richmond!\" In the autumn, stung by\r\ndefeat, they were ready to cry, \"Down with Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent report, the War Department confessed that at the\r\nbeginning of hostilities, \"nearly all our arms and ammunition\" came from\r\nforeign countries. One great reason why no military successes relieve\r\nthe gloom of 1861 was that, from a soldier's point of view, there\r\nwere no armies. Soldiers, it is true, there were in myriads; but arms,\r\nammunition, and above all, organization were lacking. The supplies\r\nin the government arsenals had been provided for an army of but a few\r\nthousand. Strive as they would, all the factories in the country could\r\nnot come anywhere near making arms for half a million men; nor did the\r\nfacilities of those days make it possible for munition plants to spring\r\nup overnight. Had it not been that the Confederacy was equally hard\r\npushed, even harder pushed, to find arms and ammunition, the war would\r\nhave ended inside Seward's ninety days, through sheer lack of powder.\r\n\r\nEven with the respite given by the unpreparedness of the South, and\r\nwhile Lincoln hurriedly collected arms and ammunition from abroad, the\r\nstartled nation, thus suddenly forced into a realization of what\r\nwar meant, lost its head. From its previous reckless trust in sheer\r\nenthusiasm, it reacted to a distrust of almost everything. Why were the\r\nsoldiers not armed? Why did not millions of rounds of cartridges fall\r\nlike manna out of the sky? Why did not the crowds of volunteers become\r\narmies at a word of command? One of the darkest pages in American\r\nhistory records the way in which the crowd, undisciplined to endure\r\nstrain, turned upon Lincoln in its desire to find in the conduct of\r\ntheir leader a pretext for venting upon him the fierceness of their\r\nanxiety. Such a pretext they found in his treatment of Fremont.\r\n\r\nThe singular episode of Fremont's arrogance in 1861 is part of the\r\nstory of the border States whose friendship was eagerly sought by both\r\nsides--Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and those mountainous counties\r\nwhich in time were to become West Virginia. To retain Maryland and thus\r\nto keep open the connection between the Capital and the North was one\r\nof Lincoln's deepest anxieties. By degrees the hold of the Government\r\nin Maryland was made secure, and the State never seceded. Kentucky, too,\r\nheld to the Union, though, during many anxious months in 1861, Lincoln\r\ndid not know whether this State was to be for him or against him. The\r\nVirginia mountains, from the first, seemed a more hopeful field, for the\r\nmountaineers had opposed the Virginia secession and, as soon as it was\r\naccomplished, had begun holding meetings of protest. In the meantime\r\nGeorge B. McClellan, with the rank of general bestowed upon him by the\r\nFederal Government, had been appointed to command the militia of Ohio.\r\nHe was sent to assist the insurgent mountaineers, and with him went the\r\nOhio militia. From this situation and from the small engagements with\r\nConfederate forces in which McClellan was successful, there resulted the\r\nseparate State of West Virginia and the extravagant popular notion that\r\nMcClellan was a great general. His successes were contrasted in the\r\nordinary mind with the crushing defeat at Bull Run, which happened at\r\nabout the same time.\r\n\r\nThe most serious of all these struggles in the border States, however,\r\nwas that which took place in Missouri, where, owing to the strength\r\nof both factions and their promptness in organizing, real war began\r\nimmediately. A Union army led by General Nathaniel Lyon attacked the\r\nConfederates with great spirit at Wilson's Creek but was beaten back in\r\na fierce and bloody battle in which their leader was killed.\r\n\r\nEven before these events Fremont had been appointed to chief command\r\nin Missouri, and here he at once began a strange course of dawdling and\r\nposing. His military career must be left to the military historians--who\r\nhave not ranked him among the great generals. Civil history accuses him,\r\nif not of using his new position to make illegitimate profits, at least\r\nof showing reckless favoritism toward those who did. It is hardly unfair\r\nto say that Lincoln, in bearing with Fremont as long as he did, showed\r\na touch of amiable weakness; and yet, it must be acknowledged that the\r\nPresident knew that the country was in a dangerous mood, that Fremont\r\nwas immensely popular, and that any change might be misunderstood.\r\nThough Lincoln hated to appear anything but a friend to a fallen\r\npolitical rival, he was at last forced to act. Frauds in government\r\ncontracts at St. Louis were a public scandal, and the reputation of the\r\ngovernment had to be saved by the removal of Fremont in November, 1861.\r\nAs an immediate consequence of this action the overstrained nerves of\r\ngreat numbers of people snapped. Fremont's personal followers, as well\r\nas the abolitionists whom he had actively supported while in command in\r\nMissouri, and all that vast crowd of excitable people who are unable to\r\nstand silent under strain, clamored against Lincoln in the wildest and\r\nmost absurd vein. He was accused of being a \"dictator\"; he was called an\r\n\"imbecile\"; he ought to be impeached, and a new party, with Fremont as\r\nits leader, should be formed to prosecute the war. But through all this\r\nclamor Lincoln kept his peace and let the heathen rage.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year, popular rage turned suddenly on Cameron,\r\nwho, as Secretary of War, had taken an active but proper part in the\r\ninvestigation of Fremont's conduct. It was one of those tremulous\r\nmoments when people are desperately eager to have something done and are\r\nready to believe anything. Though McClellan, now in chief command of\r\nthe Union forces, had an immense army which was fast getting properly\r\nequipped, month faded into month without his advancing against the\r\nenemy. Again the popular cry was raised, \"On to Richmond!\" It was at\r\nthis moment of military inactivity and popular restlessness that charges\r\nof peculation were brought forward against Cameron.\r\n\r\nThese charges both were and were not well founded. Himself a rich\r\nman, it is not likely that Cameron profited personally by government\r\ncontracts, even though the acrimonious Thad Stevens said of his\r\nappointment as Secretary that it would add \"another million to his\r\nfortune.\" There seems little doubt, however, that Cameron showered\r\nlucrative contracts upon his political retainers. And no boss has ever\r\nheld the State of Pennsylvania in a firmer grip. His tenure of the\r\nSecretaryship of War was one means to that end.\r\n\r\nThe restless alarm of the country at large expressed itself in such\r\nextravagant words as these which Senator Grimes wrote to Senator\r\nFessenden: \"We are going to destruction as fast as imbecility,\r\ncorruption, and the wheels of time can carry us.\" So dissatisfied,\r\nindeed, was Congress with the conduct of the war that it appointed a\r\ncommittee of investigation. During December, 1861, and January, 1862,\r\nthe committee was summoning generals before it, questioning them,\r\nlistening to all manner of views, accomplishing nothing, but rendering\r\nmore and more feverish an atmosphere already surcharged with anxiety.\r\nOn the floors of Congress debate raged as to who was responsible for\r\nthe military inaction--for the country's \"unpreparedness,\" we should say\r\ntoday--and as to whether Cameron was honest. Eventually the House in a\r\nvote of censure condemned the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nLong before this happened, however, Lincoln had interfered and very\r\ncharacteristically removed the cause of trouble, while taking upon\r\nhimself the responsibility for the situation, by nominating Cameron\r\nminister to Russia, and by praising him for his \"ability, patriotism,\r\nand fidelity to the public trust.\" Though the President had not\r\nsufficient hold upon the House to prevent the vote of censure, his\r\ninfluence was strong in the Senate, and the new appointment of Cameron\r\nwas promptly confirmed.\r\n\r\nThere was in Washington at this time that grim man who had served\r\nbriefly as Attorney-General in the Cabinet of Buchanan--Edwin M.\r\nStanton. He despised the President and expressed his opinion in such\r\nwords as \"the painful imbecility of Lincoln.\" The two had one personal\r\nrecollection in common: long before, in a single case, at Cincinnati,\r\nthe awkward Lincoln had been called in as associate counsel to serve the\r\nconvenience of Stanton, who was already a lawyer of national repute.\r\nTo his less-known associate Stanton showed a brutal rudeness that was\r\ncharacteristic. It would have been hard in 1861 to find another man more\r\ndifficult to get on with. Headstrong, irascible, rude, he had a sharp\r\ntongue which he delighted in using; but he was known to be inflexibly\r\nhonest, and was supposed to have great executive ability. He was also\r\na friend of McClellan, and if anybody could rouse that tortoise-like\r\ngeneral, Stanton might be supposed to be the man. He had been a valiant\r\nDemocrat, and Democratic support was needed by the government. Lincoln\r\nastonished him with his appointment as Secretary of War in January,\r\n1862. Stanton justified the President's choice, and under his strong\r\nif ruthless hand the War Department became sternly efficient. The whole\r\nstory of Stanton's relations to his chief is packed, like the Arabian\r\ngenius in the fisherman's vase, into one remark of Lincoln's. \"Did\r\nStanton tell you I was a fool?\" said Lincoln on one occasion, in the\r\nodd, smiling way he had. \"Then I expect I must be one, for he is almost\r\nalways right, and generally says what he means.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his efficiency and personal force, Stanton was unable to\r\nmove his friend McClellan, with whom he soon quarreled. Each now sought\r\nin his own way to control the President, though neither understood\r\nLincoln's character. From McClellan, Lincoln endured much condescension\r\nof a kind perilously near impertinence. To Stanton, Lincoln's patience\r\nseemed a mystery; to McClellan--a vain man, full of himself--the\r\nPresident who would merely smile at this bullyragging on the part of\r\none of his subordinates seemed indeed a spiritless creature. Meanwhile\r\nLincoln, apparently devoid of sensibility, was seeking during the\r\nanxious months of 1862, in one case, merely how to keep his petulant\r\nSecretary in harness; in the other, how to quicken his tortoise of a\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nStanton made at least one great blunder. Though he had been three months\r\nin office, and McClellan was still inactive, there were already several\r\nsuccesses to the credit of the Union arms. The Monitor and Virginia\r\n(Merrimac) had fought their famous duel, and Grant had taken Fort\r\nDonelson. The latter success broke through the long gloom of the North\r\nand caused, as Holmes wrote, \"a delirium of excitement.\" Stanton rashly\r\nconcluded that he now had the game in his hands, and that a sufficient\r\nnumber of men had volunteered. This civilian Secretary of War, who had\r\nstill much to learn of military matters, issued an order putting a stop\r\nto recruiting. Shortly afterwards great disaster befell the Union arms.\r\nMcClellan, before Richmond, was checked in May. Early in July, his\r\npeninsula campaign ended disastrously in the terrible \"Seven Days'\r\nBattle.\"\r\n\r\nAnticipating McClellan's failure, Lincoln had already determined to call\r\nfor more troops. On July 1st, he called upon the Governors of the\r\nStates to provide him with 300,000 men to serve three years. But the\r\nvolunteering enthusiasm--explain it as you will--had suffered a check.\r\nThe psychological moment had passed. So slow was the response to the\r\ncall of July 1st, that another appeal was made early in August, this\r\ntime for 300,000 men to serve only nine months. But this also failed\r\nto rouse the country. A reinforcement of only 87,000 men was raised in\r\nresponse to this emergency call. The able lawyer in the War Department\r\nhad still much to learn about men and nations.\r\n\r\nAfter this check, terrible incidents of war came thick and fast--the\r\ndefeat at Second Manassas, in late August; the horrible drawn battle\r\nof Antietam-Sharpsburg, in September; Fredericksburg, that carnival of\r\nslaughter, in December; the dearly bought victory of Murfreesboro, which\r\nopened 1863. There were other disastrous events at least as serious.\r\nForeign affairs* were at their darkest. Within the political coalition\r\nsupporting Lincoln, contention was the order of the day. There was\r\ngeneral distrust of the President. Most alarming of all, that ebb of the\r\nwave of enthusiasm which began in midsummer, 1861, reached in the autumn\r\nof 1862 perhaps its lowest point. The measure of the reaction against\r\nLincoln was given in the Congressional election, in which, though the\r\nGovernment still retained a working majority, the Democrats gained\r\nthirty-three seats.\r\n\r\n     * See Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nIf there could be such a thing as a true psychological history of the\r\nwar, one of its most interesting pages would determine just how far\r\nStanton was responsible, through his strange blunder over recruiting,\r\nfor the check to enthusiasm among the Northern people. With this\r\nspeculation there is connected a still unsolved problem in statistics.\r\nTo what extent did the anti-Lincoln vote, in 1862, stand for sympathy\r\nwith the South, and how far was it the hopeless surrender of Unionists\r\nwho felt that their cause was lost? Though certainty on this point is\r\napparently impossible, there can be no doubt that at the opening of\r\n1863, the Government felt it must apply pressure to the flagging spirits\r\nof its supporters. In order to reenforce the armies and to push the war\r\nthrough, there was plainly but one course to be followed--conscription.\r\n\r\nThe government leaders in Congress brought in a Conscription Act early\r\nin the year. The hot debates upon this issue dragged through a month's\r\ntime, and now make instructive reading for the present generation\r\nthat has watched the Great War*. The Act of 1863 was not the work of\r\nsoldiers, but was literally \"made in Congress.\" Stanton grimly made\r\nthe best of it, though he unwaveringly condemned some of its most\r\nconspicuous provisions. His business was to retrieve his blunder of\r\nthe previous year, and he was successful. Imperfect as it was, the\r\nConscription Act, with later supplementary legislation, enabled him to\r\nreplace the wastage of the Union armies and steadily to augment them.\r\nAt the close of the war, the Union had on foot a million men with an\r\nenrolled reserve of two millions and a half, subject to call.\r\n\r\n     * The battle over conscription in England was anticipated in\r\n     America sixty-four years ago.  Bagot says that the average\r\n     British point of view may be expressed thus: \"What I am\r\n     sayin' is this here as I was a sayin' yesterday.\"  The\r\n     Anglo-Saxon mind is much the same the world over.  In\r\n     America, today, the enemies of effective military\r\n     organization would do well to search the arguments of their\r\n     skillful predecessors in 1888, who fought to the last ditch\r\n     for a military system that would make inescapable \"peace at\r\n     any price.\"  For the modern believers in conscription, one\r\n     of their best bits of political thunder is still the defense\r\n     of it by Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe Act provided for a complete military census, for which purpose the\r\ncountry was divided into enrollment districts. Every able-bodied\r\nmale citizen, or intending citizen, between the ages of twenty and\r\nforty-five, unless exempted for certain specified reasons, was to be\r\nenrolled as a member of the national forces; these forces were to be\r\ncalled to the colors--\"drafted,\" the term was--as the Government found\r\nneed of them; each successive draft was to be apportioned among the\r\ndistricts in the ratio of the military population, and the number\r\nrequired was to be drawn by lot; if the district raised its quota\r\nvoluntarily, no draft would be made; any drafted man could offer a\r\nsubstitute or could purchase his discharge for three hundred dollars.\r\nThe latter provision especially was condemned by Stanton. It was seized\r\nupon by demagogues as a device for giving rich men an advantage over\r\npoor men.\r\n\r\nAmerican politics during the war form a wildly confused story, so\r\nintricate that it cannot be made clear in a brief statement. But\r\nthis central fact may be insisted upon: in the North, there were two\r\npolitical groups that were the poles around which various other groups\r\nrevolved and combined, only to fly asunder and recombine, with all the\r\nmaddening inconstancy of a kaleidoscope. The two irreconcilable elements\r\nwere the \"war party\" made up of determined men resolved to see things\r\nthrough, and the \"copperheads\"* who for one reason or another united\r\nin a faithful struggle for peace at any price. Around the copperheads\r\ngathered the various and singular groups who helped to make up the ever\r\nfluctuating \"peace party.\" It is an error to assume that this peace\r\nparty was animated throughout by fondness for the Confederacy. Though\r\nmany of its members were so actuated, the core of the party seems to\r\nhave been that strange type of man who sustained political evasion\r\nin the old days, who thought that sweet words can stop bullets, whose\r\nprogramme in 1863 called for a cessation of hostilities and a general\r\nconvention of all the States, and who promised as the speedy result of\r\na debauch of talk a carnival of bright eyes glistening with the tears\r\nof revived affection. With these strange people in 1863 there combined\r\na number of different types: the still stranger, still less creditable\r\nvisionary, of whom much hereafter; the avowed friends of the principle\r\nof state rights; all those who distrusted the Government because of its\r\nanti-slavery sympathies; Quakers and others with moral scruples against\r\nwar; and finally, sincere legalists to whom the Conscription Act\r\nappeared unconstitutional. In the spring of 1863 the issue of\r\nconscription drew the line fairly sharply between the two political\r\ncoalitions, though each continued to fluctuate, more or less, to the end\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n     * The term arose, it has been said, from the use of the\r\n     copper cent with its head of Liberty as a peace button.  But\r\n     a more plausible explanation associates the peace advocates\r\n     with the deadly copperhead snake.\r\n\r\nThe peace party of 1863 has been denounced hastily rather than carefully\r\nstudied. Its precise machinations are not fully known, but the ugly fact\r\nstands forth that a portion of the foreign population of the North was\r\nroused in 1863 to rebellion. The occasion was the beginning of the first\r\ndraft under the new law, in July, 1863, and the scene of the rebellion\r\nwas the City of New York. The opponents of conscription had already\r\nmade inflammatory attacks on the Government. Conspicuous among them was\r\nHoratio Seymour, who had been elected Governor of New York in that wave\r\nof reaction in the autumn of 1862. Several New York papers joined the\r\ncrusade. In Congress, the Government had already been threatened with\r\ncivil war if the act was enforced. Nevertheless, the public drawing\r\nby lot began on the days announced. In New York the first drawing took\r\nplace on Saturday, July 12th, and the lists were published in the Sunday\r\npapers. As might be expected, many of the men drawn were of foreign\r\nbirth, and all day Sunday, the foreign quarter of New York was a\r\ncauldron boiling.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the resumption of the drawing was the signal for revolt.\r\nA mob invaded one of the conscription offices, drove off the men in\r\ncharge, and set fire to the building. In a short while, the streets were\r\nfilled with dense crowds of foreignborn workmen shouting, \"Down with\r\nthe rich men,\" and singing, \"We'll hang Horace Greeley on a sour apple\r\ntree.\" Houses of prominent citizens were attacked and set on fire, and\r\nseveral drafting offices were burned. Many negroes who were seized were\r\neither clubbed to death or hanged to lamp posts. Even an orphan asylum\r\nfor colored children was burned. The office of the \"Tribune\" was raided,\r\ngutted, and set on fire. Finally a dispatch to Stanton, early in the\r\nnight, reported that the mob had taken possession of the city.\r\n\r\nThe events of the next day were no less shocking. The city was almost\r\nstripped of soldiers, as all available reserves had already been hurried\r\nsouth when Lee was advancing toward Gettysburg. But such militia as\r\ncould be mustered, with a small force of federal troops, fought the mob\r\nin the streets. Barricades were carried by storm; blood was freely shed.\r\nIt was not, however, until the fourth day that the rebellion was finally\r\nquelled, chiefly by New York regiments, hurried north by Stanton--among\r\nthem the famous Seventh--which swept the streets with cannon.\r\n\r\nThe aftermath of the New York riots was a correspondence between Lincoln\r\nand Seymour. The latter had demanded a suspension of the draft until the\r\ncourts could decide on the constitutionality of the Conscription Act.\r\nLincoln refused. With ten thousand troops now assembled in New York, the\r\ndraft was resumed, and there was no further trouble.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to the Government in New York was but the most terrible\r\nepisode in a protracted contention which involves, as Americans are\r\nbeginning to see, one of the most fundamental and permanent questions\r\nof Lincoln's rule: how can the exercise of necessary war powers by\r\nthe President be reconciled with the guarantees of liberty in the\r\nConstitution? It is unfortunate that Lincoln did not draw up a fully\r\nrounded statement of his own theory regarding this problem, instead\r\nof leaving it to be inferred from detached observations and from his\r\nactions. Apparently, he felt there was nothing to do but to follow the\r\nRoman precedent and, in a case of emergency, frankly permit the use\r\nof extraordinary power. We may attribute to him that point of view\r\nexpressed by a distinguished Democrat of our own day: \"Democracy has to\r\nlearn how to use the dictator as a necessary war tool.\"* Whether Lincoln\r\nset a good model for democracy in this perilous business is still to be\r\ndetermined. His actions have been freely labeled usurpation. The first\r\nnotorious instance occurred in 1861, during the troubles in Maryland,\r\nwhen he authorized military arrests of suspected persons. For the\r\nrelease of one of these, a certain Merryman, Chief Justice Taney\r\nissued a writ of habeas corpus**. Lincoln authorized his military\r\nrepresentatives to disregard the writ. In 1862 he issued a proclamation\r\nsuspending the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus in cases of\r\npersons charged with \"discouraging volunteer enlistments, resisting\r\nmilitary drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice....\" Such persons\r\nwere to be tried by military commissions.\r\n\r\n     *President Edwin A. Alderman, of the University of Virginia.\r\n\r\n     ** The Constitution permits the suspension of the privileges\r\n     of the writ of habeas corpus \"when in cases of rebellion or\r\n     invasion the public safety may require it,\" but fails to\r\n     provide a method of suspension.  Taney held that the power\r\n     to suspend lay with Congress.  Five years afterward, when\r\n     Chase was Chief Justice, the Supreme Court, in ex parte\r\n     Milligan, took the same view and further declared that even\r\n     Congress could not deprive a citizen of his right to trial\r\n     by jury so long as the local civil courts are in operation.\r\n     The Confederate experience differed from the Federal\r\n     inasmuch as Congress kept control of the power to suspend\r\n     the writ.  But both governments made use of such suspension\r\n     to set up martial law in districts where the local courts\r\n     were open but where, from one cause or another, the\r\n     Administration had not confidence in their effectiveness.\r\n     Under ex parte Milligan, both Presidents and both Congresses\r\n     were guilty of usurpation. The mere layman waits for the\r\n     next great hour of trial to learn whether this\r\n     interpretation will stand.  In the Milligan case the Chief\r\n     Justice and three others dissented.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that this proclamation caused something like\r\na panic in many minds, filled them with the dread of military despotism,\r\nand contributed to the reaction against Lincoln in the autumn of 1862.\r\nUnder this proclamation many arrests were made and many victims were\r\nsent to prison. So violent was the opposition that on March 3, 1863,\r\nCongress passed an act which attempted to bring the military and civil\r\ncourts into cooperation, though it did not take away from the President\r\nall the dictatorial power which he had assumed. The act seems; however,\r\nto have had little general effect, and it was disregarded in the\r\nmost celebrated of the cases of military arrest, that of Clement L.\r\nVallandigham.\r\n\r\nA representative from Ohio and one of the most vituperative anti-Lincoln\r\nmen in Congress, Vallandigham in a sensational speech applied to the\r\nexisting situation Chatham's words, \"My lords, you cannot conquer\r\nAmerica.\" He professed to see before him in the future nothing \"but\r\nuniversal political and social revolution, anarchy, and bloodshed,\r\ncompared with which the Reign of Terror in France was a merciful\r\nvisitation.\" To escape such a future, he demanded an armistice, to be\r\nfollowed by a friendly peace established through foreign mediation.\r\n\r\nReturning to Ohio after the adjournment of Congress, Vallandigham spoke\r\nto a mass-meeting in a way that was construed as rank treason by General\r\nBurnside who was in command at Cincinnati. Vallandigham was arrested,\r\ntried by court martial, and condemned to imprisonment. There was an\r\nimmediate hue and cry, in consequence of which Burnside, who reported\r\nthe affair, felt called upon also to offer to resign. Lincoln's reply\r\nwas characteristic: \"When I shall wish to supersede you I shall let\r\nyou know. All the Cabinet regretted the necessity for arresting, for\r\ninstance, Vallandigham, some perhaps doubting there was a real necessity\r\nfor it; but being done, all were for seeing you through with it.\"\r\nLincoln, however, commuted the sentence to banishment and had\r\nVallandigham sent through the lines into the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite plain that the condemnation of Lincoln on this issue of\r\nusurpation was not confined to the friends of the Confederacy, nor has\r\nit been confined to his enemies in later days. One of Lincoln's\r\nmost ardent admirers, the historian Rhodes, condemns his course\r\nunqualifiedly. \"There can be no question,\" he writes, \"that from the\r\nlegal point of view the President should have rescinded the sentence and\r\nreleased Vallandigham.\" Lincoln, he adds, \"stands responsible for\r\nthe casting into prison of citizens of the United States on orders as\r\narbitrary as the lettres-de-cachet of Louis XIV.\" Since Mr. Rhodes,\r\nuncompromising Unionist, can write as he does upon this issue, it is\r\nplain that the opposition party cannot be dismissed as through and\r\nthrough disunionist.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Vallandigham made him a martyr and brought him the\r\nDemocratic nomination for Governor of Ohio*. His followers sought to\r\nmake the issue of the campaign the acceptance or rejection of military\r\ndespotism. In defense of his course Lincoln wrote two public letters in\r\nwhich he gave evidence of the skill which he had acquired as a lawyer\r\nbefore a jury by the way in which he played upon the emotions of his\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n     * Edward Everett Hale's famous story \"The Man Without a\r\n     Country\", though it got into print too late to affect the\r\n     election, was aimed at Vallandigham.  That quaint allegory\r\n     on the lack of patriotism became a temporary classic.\r\n\r\n\"Long experience [he wrote] has shown that armies cannot be maintained\r\nunless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death.\r\nThe case requires, and the law and the Constitution sanction, this\r\npunishment. Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while\r\nI must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert?\r\nThis is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father, or\r\nbrother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working upon his\r\nfeelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is\r\nfighting in a bad cause for a wicked administration and a contemptible\r\ngovernment, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert. I\r\nthink that in such a case to silence the agitator and save the boy is\r\nnot only constitutional, but, withal, a great mercy.\"\r\n\r\nHis real argument may be summed up in these words of his:\r\n\r\n\"You ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all\r\nthe guaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the\r\npublic safety--when I may choose to say the public safety requires it.\r\nThis question, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as\r\nstruggling for an arbitrary prerogative, is either simply a question\r\nwho shall decide, or an affirmation that nobody shall decide, what the\r\npublic safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for\r\ndecision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it. By\r\nnecessary implication, when rebellion or invasion comes, the decision is\r\nto be made, from time to time; and I think the man, whom for the time,\r\nthe people have under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief\r\nof their army and navy, is the man who holds the power and bears the\r\nresponsibility of making it. If he uses the power justly, the same\r\npeople will probably justify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands\r\nto be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in\r\nthe Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln virtually appealed to the Northern people to secure efficiency\r\nby setting him momentarily above all civil authority. He asked them\r\nin substance, to interpret their Constitution by a show of hands. No\r\nthoughtful person can doubt the risks of such a method; yet in Ohio,\r\nin 1863, the great majority--perhaps everyone who believed in the\r\nwar--accepted Lincoln's position. Between their traditional system of\r\nlegal juries and the new system of military tribunals the Ohio voters\r\nmade their choice without hesitation. They rejected Vallandigham\r\nand sustained the Lincoln candidate by a majority of over a hundred\r\nthousand. That same year in New York the anti-Lincoln candidate for\r\nSecretary of State was defeated by twenty-nine thousand votes.\r\n\r\nThough these elections in 1863 can hardly be called the turning-point in\r\nthe history of the Lincoln Government, yet it was clear that the tide\r\nof popularity which had ebbed so far away from Lincoln in the autumn of\r\n1862 was again in the flood. Another phase of his stormy course may be\r\nthought of as having ended. And in accounting for this turn of the tide\r\nit must not be forgotten that between the nomination and the defeat of\r\na Vallandigham the bloody rebellion in New York had taken place,\r\nGettysburg had been fought, and Grant had captured Vicksburg. The autumn\r\nof 1863 formed a breathing space for the war party of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE CRUCIAL MATTER\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of historians to measure the relative strength of North\r\nand South chiefly in terms of population. The North numbered 23,000,000\r\ninhabitants; the South, about 9,000,000, of which the slave population\r\namounted to 3,500,000. But these obvious statistics only partially\r\nindicate the real situation. Not what one has, but what one is capable\r\nof using is, of course, the true measure of strength. If, in 1861,\r\neither side could have struck swiftly and with all its force, the story\r\nof the war would have been different. The question of relative strength\r\nwas in reality a question of munitions. Both powers were glaringly\r\nunprepared. Both had instant need of great supplies of arms and\r\nammunition, and both turned to European manufacturers for aid. Those\r\nAmericans who, in a later war, wished to make illegal the neutral trade\r\nin munitions forgot that the international right of a belligerent to buy\r\narms from a neutral had prevented their own destruction in 1861. In\r\nthe supreme American crisis, agents of both North and South hurried to\r\nEurope in quest of munitions. On the Northern side the work was done\r\nchiefly by the three ministers, Charles Francis Adams, at London;\r\nWilliam L. Dayton, at Paris; and Henry S. Sanford, at Brussels; by\r\nan able special agent, Colonel George L. Schuyler; and by the famous\r\nbanking-house of Baring Brothers, which one might almost have called the\r\nEuropean department of the United States Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe eager solicitude of the War Department over the competition of the\r\ntwo groups of agents in Europe informs a number of dispatches that are,\r\ntoday, precious admonitions to the heedless descendants of that dreadful\r\ntime. As late as October, 1861, the Acting Secretary of War wrote to\r\nSchuyler, one of whose shipments had been delayed: \"The Department\r\nearnestly hopes to receive...the 12,000 Enfield rifles and the remainder\r\nof the 27,000, which you state you have purchased, by the earliest\r\nsteamer following. Could you appreciate the circumstances by which we\r\nare surrounded, you would readily understand the urgent necessity there\r\nis for the immediate delivery of all the arms you are authorized to\r\npurchase. The Department expects to hear that you have been able\r\nto conclude the negotiations for the 48,000 rifles from the French\r\ngovernment arsenals.\" That the Confederate Government acted even more\r\npromptly than the Union Government appears from a letter of Sanford to\r\nSeward in May: \"I have vainly expected orders,\" he complains, \"for\r\nthe purchase of arms for the Government, and am tempted to order from\r\nBelgium all they can send over immediately.... Meanwhile the workshops\r\nare filling with orders from the South.... It distresses me to think\r\nthat while we are in want of them, Southern money is taking them away to\r\nbe used against us.\"\r\n\r\nAt London, Adams took it upon himself to contract for arms in advance of\r\ninstructions. He wrote to Seward: \"Aware of the degree to which I exceed\r\nmy authority in taking such a step, nothing but a conviction of the need\r\nin which the country stands of such assistance and the joint opinion of\r\nall the diplomatic agents of the United States...in Paris, has induced\r\nme to overcome my scruples.\" How real was the necessity of which this\r\nable diplomat was so early conscious, is demonstrated at every turn\r\nin the papers of the War Department. Witness this brief dispatch from\r\nHarrisburg: \"All ready to leave but no arms. Governor not willing to\r\nlet us leave State without them, as act of Assembly forbids. Can arms\r\nbe sent here?\" When this appeal was made, in December, 1861, arms were\r\npouring into the country from Europe, and the crisis had passed. But if\r\nthis appeal had been made earlier in the year, the inevitable answer may\r\nbe guessed from a dispatch which the Ordnance Office sent, as late as\r\nSeptember, to the authorities of West Virginia, refusing to supply\r\nthem with arms because the supplies were exhausted, and adding, \"Every\r\npossible exertion is being made to obtain additional supplies by\r\ncontract, by manufacture, and by purchase, and as soon as they can be\r\nprocured by any means, in any way, they will be supplied.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, not only the Confederacy but various States of the\r\nNorth were more expeditious in this all-important matter than Cameron\r\nand the War Department. Schuyler's first dispatch from London gives\r\nthis singular information: \"All private establishments in Birmingham\r\nand London are now working for the States of Ohio, Connecticut, and\r\nMassachusetts, except the London Armory, whose manufacture is supposed\r\nto go to the Rebels, but of this last fact I am not positively informed.\r\nI am making arrangements to secure these establishments for our\r\nGovernment, if desirable after the present State contracts expire. On\r\nthe Continent, Messrs, Dayton and Sanford...have been making contracts\r\nand agreements of various kinds, of which you are by this time\r\ninformed.\" Soon afterward, from Paris, he made a long report detailing\r\nthe difficulties of his task, the limitations of the existing munitions\r\nplants in Europe, and promising among other things those \"48,000 rifles\r\nfrom the French government arsenals\" for which, in the letter already\r\nquoted, the War Department yearned. It was an enormous labor; and,\r\nstrive as he would, Schuyler found American mail continuing to bring him\r\nsuch letters as this from the Assistant Secretary of War in October: \"I\r\nnotice with much regret that [in the latest consignment] there were no\r\nguns sent, as it was confidently expected that 20,000 would arrive by\r\nthe [steamship] Fulton, and accordingly arrangements had been made to\r\ndistribute them through the different States. Prompt and early shipments\r\nof guns are desirable. We hope to hear by next steamer that you have\r\nshipped from 80,000 to 100,000 stand.\"\r\n\r\nThe last word on the problem of munitions, which was so significant\r\na factor in the larger problem, is the report of the United States\r\nOrdnance Office for the first year of the war. It shows that between\r\nApril, 1861, and June, 1862, the Government purchased from American\r\nmanufacturers somewhat over 30,000 rifles, and that from European makers\r\nit purchased 726,000.\r\n\r\nFrom these illustrations it is therefore obvious that the true measure\r\nof the immediate strength of the American contestants in 1861 was the\r\nextent of their ability to supply themselves from Europe; and this,\r\nstated more concretely, became the question as to which was the better\r\nable to keep its ports open and receive the absolutely essential\r\nEuropean aid. Lincoln showed his clear realization of the situation\r\nwhen he issued, immediately after the first call for volunteers, a\r\nproclamation blockading the Southern coasts. Whether the Northern people\r\nat the time appreciated the significance of this order is a question.\r\nAmid the wild and vain clamor of the multitude in 1861, with its\r\nconventional and old-fashioned notion of war as a thing of trumpets and\r\nglittering armies, the North seems wholly to have ignored its fleet; and\r\nyet in the beginning this resource was its only strength.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was small, to be sure, but its task was at first also small.\r\nThere were few Southern ports which were doing a regular business with\r\nEurope, and to close these was not difficult. As other ports opened and\r\nthe task of blockade grew, the Northern navy also increased. Within a\r\nfew months, to the few observers who did not lose their heads, it was\r\nplain that the North had won the first great contest of the war. It had\r\nso hampered Southern trade that Lincoln's advantage in arming the North\r\nfrom Europe was ten to one. At the very time when detractors of Lincoln\r\nwere hysterical over the removal of Fremont, when Grimes wrote to\r\nFessenden that the country was going to the dogs as fast as imbecility\r\ncould carry it, this great achievement had quietly taken place. An\r\nexpedition sailing in August from Fortress Monroe seized the forts which\r\ncommanded Hatteras Inlet off the coast of North Carolina. In November,\r\nCommander Dupont, U. S. N., seized Port Royal, one of the best harbors\r\non the coast of South Carolina, and established there a naval base.\r\nThenceforth, while the open Northern ports received European munitions\r\nwithout hindrance, it was a risky business getting munitions into the\r\nports of the South. Only the boldest traders would attempt to \"run the\r\nblockade,\" to evade the Federal patrol ships by night and run into a\r\nSouthern port.\r\n\r\nHowever, for one moment in the autumn of 1861, it seemed as if all the\r\nmasterful work of the Northern navy would be undone by the Northern\r\npeople themselves in backing up the rashness of Captain Charles Wilkes,\r\nof the war-ship San Jacinto. On the high seas he overhauled the British\r\nmail steamer, Trent. Aboard her were two Confederate diplomatic\r\nagents, James M. Mason and John Slidell, who had run the blockade from\r\nCharleston to Havana and were now on their way to England. Wilkes took\r\noff the two Confederates as prisoners of war. The crowd in the North\r\nwent wild. \"We do not believe,\" said the New York Times, \"that the\r\nAmerican heart ever thrilled with more sincere delight.\"\r\n\r\nThe intemperate joy of the crowd over the rashness of Wilkes was due in\r\npart to a feeling of bitterness against the British Government. In\r\nMay, 1861, the Queen had issued a proclamation of neutrality, whose\r\njustification in international law was hotly debated at the time and was\r\ngenerally denied by Northerners. England was the great cotton market of\r\nthe world. To the excited Northern mind, in 1861, there could be but one\r\nexplanation of England's action: a partisan desire to serve the South,\r\nto break up the blockade, and to secure cotton. Whether such was the\r\nreal purpose of the ministry then in power is now doubted; but at\r\nthat time it was the beginning of a sharp contention between the two\r\nGovernments. The Trent affair naturally increased the tension. So keen\r\nwas the indignation of all classes of Englishmen that it seemed, for a\r\nmoment, as if the next step would be war.\r\n\r\nIn America, the prompt demand for the release of Mason and Slidell was\r\nmet, at first, in a spirit equally bellicose. Fortunately there were\r\ncool and clear heads that at once condemned Wilkes's action as a gross\r\nbreach of international law. Prominent among these was Sumner. The\r\nAmerican Government, however, admitted the justice of the British demand\r\nand the envoys were released.\r\n\r\nRelations with the United States now became a burning issue in\r\nEnglish politics. There were three distinct groups in Parliament. The\r\nrepresentatives of the aristocracy, whether Liberals or Conservatives,\r\nin the main sympathized with the South. So did most of the large\r\nmanufacturers whose business interests were affected by cotton. Great\r\nbitterness grew up among the Northerners against both these groups,\r\npartly because in the past many of their members had condemned slavery\r\nand had said scornful things about America for tolerating it. To these\r\nNortherners the Englishmen replied that Lincoln himself had declared\r\nthe war was not over slavery; that it was an ordinary civil war not\r\ninvolving moral issues. Nevertheless, the third Parliamentary group\r\ninsisted that the American war, no matter what the motives of the\r\nparticipants, would, in the event of a Northern victory, bring about the\r\nabolition of slavery, whereas, if the South won, the result would be\r\nthe perpetuation of slavery. This third group, therefore, threw all its\r\nweight on the side of the North. In this group Lincoln recognized his\r\nallies, and their cause he identified with his own in his letter to\r\nEnglish workmen which was quoted in the previous chapter. Their leaders\r\nin Parliament were Richard Cobden, W. E. Forster, and John Bright.\r\nAll these groups were represented in the Liberal party, which, for the\r\nmoment, was in power.\r\n\r\nIn the Cabinet itself there was a \"Northern\" and a \"Southern\" faction.\r\nThen, too, there were some who sympathized with the North but who felt\r\nthat its cause was hopeless--so little did they understand the relative\r\nstrength of the two sections--and who felt that the war was a terrible\r\nproof of the uselessness of mere suffering. Gladstone, in later days,\r\nwished to be thought of as having been one of these, though at the time,\r\na famous utterance of his was construed in the North as a declaration\r\nof hostility. To a great audience at Newcastle he said in October, 1862:\r\n\"We may have our own opinions about slavery; we may be for or against\r\nthe South; but there is no doubt that Jefferson Davis and other leaders\r\nof the South have made an army; they are making, it appears, a navy; and\r\nthey have made, what is more than either--they have made a nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, wished to intervene in the American\r\nwar and bring about an amicable separation into two countries, and so,\r\napparently, did the Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell. Recently, the\r\nAmerican minister had vainly protested against the sailing of a ship\r\nknown as 290 which was being equipped at Liverpool presumably for the\r\nservice of the Confederacy, and which became the famous Alabama. For two\r\nyears it roved the ocean destroying Northern commerce, and not until\r\nit was sunk at last in a battle with the U. S. S. Kearsarge did all the\r\nmaritime interests of the North breathe again freely. In time and as a\r\nresult of arbitration, England paid for the ships sunk by the Alabama.\r\nBut in 1862, the protests of the American minister fell on deaf ears.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that the sailing of the Alabama from Liverpool was\r\ndue probably to the carelessness of British officials rather than to\r\ndeliberate purpose. And yet the fact is clear that about the first of\r\nOctober, 1862, the British ministry was on the verge of intervening to\r\nsecure recognition of the independence of the Southern confederacy. The\r\nchief motive pressing them forward was the distress in England caused by\r\nthe lack of cotton which resulted from the American blockade. In 1860,\r\nthe South had exported 615,000 bales; in 1861, only 10,127 bales. In\r\n1862 half the spindles of Manchester were idle; the workmen were out of\r\nemployment; the owners were without dividends. It was chiefly by these\r\nmanufacturing capitalists that pressure was put upon the ministry,\r\nand it was in the manufacturing district that Gladstone, thinking the\r\nGovernment was likely to intervene, made his allusion to the South as a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Emperor of the French was considering a proposal to\r\nEngland and Russia to join with him in mediation between the American\r\nbelligerents. On October 28, 1862, Napoleon III gave audience to the\r\nConfederate envoy at Paris, discussed the Southern cause in the most\r\nfriendly manner, questioned him upon the Maryland campaign, plainly\r\nindicated his purpose to attempt intervention, and at parting cordially\r\nshook hands with him. Within a few days the Emperor made good his\r\nimplied promise.\r\n\r\nThe month of November, 1862, is one of the turning-points in American\r\nforeign relations. Both Russia and England rejected France's proposal.\r\nThe motive usually assigned to the Emperor Alexander is his hatred of\r\neverything associated with slavery. His own most famous action was the\r\nliberation of the Russian serfs. The motives of the British ministry,\r\nhowever, appear more problematical.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes thinks he can discern evidence that Adams communicated\r\nindirectly to Palmerston the contents of a dispatch from Seward which\r\nindicated that the United States would accept war rather than mediation.\r\nPalmerston had kept his eyes upon the Maryland campaign, and Lee's\r\nwithdrawal did not increase his confidence in the strength of the South.\r\nLord Russell, two months previous, had flatly told the Confederate envoy\r\nat London that the South need not hope for recognition unless it could\r\nestablish itself without aid, and that \"the fluctuating events of\r\nthe war, the alternation of defeat and victory,\" composed such a\r\ncontradictory situation that \"Her Majesty's Government are still\r\ndetermined to wait.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the veiled American warning--assuming it was conveyed to\r\nPalmerston, which seems highly probable--was not the only diplomatic\r\ninnuendo of the autumn of 1862 that has escaped the pages of history.\r\nSlidell at Paris, putting together the statements of the British\r\nAmbassador and those of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, found in\r\nthem contradictions as to what was going on between the two governments\r\nin relation to America. He took a hand by attempting to inspire M.\r\nDrouyn de L'huys with distrust of England, telling him he \"HAD SEEN...a\r\nletter from a leading member of the British Cabinet...in which he very\r\nplainly insinuated that France was playing an unfair game,\" trying to\r\nuse England as Napoleon's catspaw. Among the many motives that may\r\nwell have animated the Palmerston Government in its waiting policy, a\r\ndistrust of Napoleon deserves to be considered.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely rash, however, to find the chief motive in home politics.\r\nThe impetuous Gladstone at Newcastle lost his head and spoke too soon.\r\nThe most serious effect of his premature utterance was the prompt\r\nreaction of the \"Northern party\" in the Cabinet and in the country.\r\nWhatever Palmerston's secret desires were, he was not prepared to take\r\nthe high hand, and he therefore permitted other members of the Cabinet\r\nto state in public that Gladstone had been misunderstood. In an\r\ninterview with Adams, Lord Russell, \"whilst endeavoring to excuse Mr.\r\nGladstone,\" assured him that \"the policy of the Government was to adhere\r\nto a strict neutrality and leave the struggle to settle itself.\" In the\r\nlast analysis, the Northern party in England was gaining ground. The\r\nnews from America, possibly, and Gladstone's rashness, certainly, roused\r\nit to increased activity. Palmerston, whose tenure of power was none too\r\nsecure, dared not risk a break that might carry the disaffected into the\r\nranks of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the North rapidly grew in favor in British public\r\nopinion, and its influence upon the Government speedily increased.\r\n\r\nSays Lord Charnwood in his recent life of Lincoln: \"The battle of\r\nAntietam was followed within five days by an event which made it\r\nimpossible for any government of this country to take action unfriendly\r\nto the North.\" He refers of course to the Emancipation Proclamation,\r\nwhich was issued on September 23, 1862. Lord Charnwood's remark may\r\nbe too dramatic. But there can be no doubt that the Emancipation\r\nProclamation was the turning-point in Lincoln's foreign policy; and\r\nbecause of it, his friends in England eventually forced the Government\r\nto play into his hands, and so frustrated Napoleon's scheme for\r\nintervention. Consequently Lincoln was able to maintain the blockade\r\nby means of which the South was strangled. Thus, at bottom, the crucial\r\nmatter was Emancipation.\r\n\r\nLincoln's policy with regard to slavery passed through three distinct\r\nstages. As we have seen, he proposed, at first, to pledge the Government\r\nnot to interfere with slavery in the States where it then existed. This\r\nwas his maximum of compromise. He would not agree to permitting its\r\nextension into new territory. He maintained this position through 1861,\r\nwhen it was made an accusation against him by the Abolitionists and\r\ncontributed to the ebb of his popularity. It also played a great part\r\nin the episode of Fremont. At a crucial moment in Fremont's career, when\r\nhis hold upon popularity seemed precarious, he set at naught the\r\npolicy of the President and issued an order (August 30, 1861), which\r\nconfiscated all property and slaves of those who were in arms against\r\nthe United States or actively aiding the enemy, and which created a\r\n\"bureau of abolition.\" Whether Fremont was acting from conviction or\r\n\"playing politics\" may be left to his biographers. In a most tactful\r\nletter Lincoln asked him to modify the order so as to conform to the\r\nConfiscation Act of Congress; and when Fremont proved obdurate, Lincoln\r\nordered him to do so. In the outcry against Lincoln when Fremont was at\r\nlast removed, the Abolitionists rang the changes on this reversal of his\r\npolicy of military abolition.\r\n\r\nAnother Federal General, Benjamin F. Butler, in the course of 1861, also\r\nraised the issue, though not in the bold fashion of Fremont. Runaway\r\nslaves came to his camp on the Virginia coast, and he refused to\r\nsurrender them to the owners. He took the ground that, as they had\r\nprobably been used in building Confederate fortifications, they might be\r\nconsidered contraband of war. He was sustained by Congress, which passed\r\nwhat is commonly called the First Confiscation Act providing that slaves\r\nused by Confederate armies in military labor should, if captured, be\r\n\"forfeited\"--which of course meant that they should be set free. But\r\nthis did not settle what should be done with runaways whose masters,\r\nthough residents of seceded States, were loyal to the Union. The War\r\nDepartment decided that they should be held until the end of the war,\r\nwhen probably there would be made \"just compensation to loyal masters.\"\r\n\r\nThis first stage of Lincoln's policy rested upon the hope that the Union\r\nmight be restored without prolonged war. He abandoned this hope about\r\nthe end of the year. Thereupon, his policy entered its second stage. In\r\nthe spring of 1862 he formulated a plan for gradual emancipation with\r\ncompensation. The slaves of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, and\r\nthe District of Columbia were to be purchased at the rate of $400 each,\r\nthus involving a total expenditure of $173,000,000. Although Congress\r\nadopted the joint resolution recommended by the President, the \"border\r\nStates\" would not accept the plan. But Congress, by virtue of its\r\nplenary power, freed the slaves by purchase in the District of Columbia,\r\nand prohibited slavery in all the territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the second stage of his policy Lincoln again had to reverse the\r\naction of an unruly general. The Federal forces operating from their\r\nbase at Port Royal had occupied a considerable portion of the Carolina\r\ncoast. General Hunter issued an order freeing all the slaves in South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, and Florida. In countermanding the order, Lincoln\r\nmade another futile appeal to the people of the border States to adopt\r\nsome plan of compensated emancipation.\r\n\r\n\"I do not argue,\" he said; \"I beseech you to make arguments for\r\nyourselves. You cannot, if you would be blind to the signs of the times.\r\nI beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it\r\nmay be, far above personal and partisan politics. This proposal makes\r\ncommon cause for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any. It\r\nacts not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come gently\r\nas the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you not\r\nembrace it? So much good has not been done by one effort in all past\r\ntime, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do.\r\nMay the vast future not have to lament that you neglected it.\"\r\n\r\nThis persuasive attitude and reluctance to force the issue had greatly\r\ndispleased the Abolitionists. Their most gifted orator, Wendell\r\nPhillips, reviled Lincoln with all the power of his literary genius,\r\nand with a fury that might be called malevolent. Meanwhile, a Second\r\nConfiscation Act proclaimed freedom for the slaves of all those who\r\nsupported the Confederate Government. Horace Greeley now published in\r\nthe \"New York Tribune\" an editorial entitled, \"The Prayer of Twenty\r\nMillions.\" He denounced Lincoln's treatment of Fremont and Hunter and\r\ndemanded radical action. Lincoln replied in a letter now famous. \"I\r\nwould save the Union,\" said he, \"I would save it the shortest way under\r\nthe Constitution.... If I could save the Union without freeing any\r\nslave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving\r\nothers alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the\r\ncolored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and\r\nwhat I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save\r\nthe Union.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, at the very time when he wrote this remarkable letter, he had\r\nin his own mind entered upon the third stage of his policy. He had\r\neven then discussed with his Cabinet an announcement favoring general\r\nemancipation. The time did not seem to them ripe. It was decided to wait\r\nuntil a Federal victory should save the announcement from appearing\r\nto be a cry of desperation. Antietam, which the North interpreted as a\r\nvictory, gave Lincoln his opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applied only to the States in arms against\r\nthe Federal Government. Such States were given three months in which to\r\nreturn to the Union. Thereafter, if they did not return, their slaves\r\nwould be regarded by that Government as free. No distinction was made\r\nbetween slaves owned by supporters of the Confederacy and those whose\r\nowners were in opposition to it. The Proclamation had no bearing on\r\nthose slave States which had not seceded. Needless to add, no\r\nseceded State returned, and a second Proclamation making their slaves\r\ntheoretically free was in due time issued on the first of January, 1863.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that this radical change of policy was made in\r\nSeptember, 1862. We have already heard of the elections which took\r\nplace soon after--those elections which mark perhaps the lowest ebb of\r\nLincoln's popularity, when Seymour was elected Governor of New York, and\r\nthe peace party gained over thirty seats in Congress. It is a question\r\nwhether, as a purely domestic measure, the Emancipation Proclamation was\r\nnot, for the time, an injury to the Lincoln Government. And yet it was\r\nthe real turning-point in the fortunes of the North. It was the central\r\nfact in the maintenance of the blockade.\r\n\r\nIn England at this time the cotton famine was at its height. Nearly a\r\nmillion people in the manufacturing districts were wholly dependent\r\nupon charity. This result of the blockade had been foreseen by the\r\nConfederate Government which was confident that the distress of\r\nEngland's working people would compel the English ministry to intervene\r\nand break the blockade. The employers in England whose loss was wholly\r\nfinancial, did as the Confederates hoped they would do. The workmen,\r\nhowever, took a different course. Schooled by a number of able debaters,\r\nthey fell into line with that third group of political leaders who\r\nsaw in the victory of the North, whatever its motives, the eventual\r\nextinction of slavery. To these people, the Emancipation Proclamation\r\ngave a definite programme. It was now, the leaders argued, no longer a\r\nquestion of eventual effect; the North had proclaimed a motive and that\r\nmotive was the extinction of slavery. Great numbers of Englishmen of all\r\nclasses who had hitherto held back from supporting Cobden and Bright now\r\nranged themselves on their side. Addresses of praise and sympathy \"began\r\nto pour into the Legation of the United States in a steady and ever\r\nswelling stream.\" An immense popular demonstration took place at Exeter\r\nHall. Cobden, writing to Sumner, described the new situation in British\r\npolitics, in a letter amounting to an assurance that the Government\r\nnever again would attempt to resist the popular pressure in favor of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of 1862 a meeting of workingmen at Manchester, where the\r\ncotton famine was causing untold misery, adopted one of those New\r\nYear greetings to Lincoln. Lincoln's reply expressed with his usual\r\ndirectness his own view of the sympathetic relation that had been\r\nestablished between the democratic classes of the two countries:\r\n\r\n\"I know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at\r\nManchester, and in all Europe, are called to endure in this crisis. It\r\nhas been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow\r\nthis Government, which was built upon the foundation of human rights,\r\nand to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis\r\nof human slavery, was likely to obtain the favor of Europe. Through\r\nthe action of our disloyal citizens, the workingmen of Europe have been\r\nsubjected to severe trials, for the purpose of forcing their sanction to\r\nthat attempt. Under the circumstances, I cannot but regard your decisive\r\nutterances upon the question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism\r\nwhich has not been surpassed in any age or in any country. It is indeed\r\nan energetic and reinspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth,\r\nand of the ultimate triumph of justice, humanity, and freedom. I do not\r\ndoubt that the sentiments you have expressed will be sustained by your\r\ngreat nation; and, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring\r\nyou that they will excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal\r\nfeelings of friendship among the American people. I hail this\r\ninterchange of sentiment, therefore, as an augury that whatever else may\r\nhappen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own, the peace\r\nand friendship which now exists between the two nations will be, as it\r\nshall be my desire to make them, perpetual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\r\n\r\nThough the defeat of the Democrats at the polls in 1863 and the now\r\ndefinitely friendly attitude of England had done much to secure the\r\nstability of the Lincoln Government, this success was due in part to\r\na figure which now comes to the front and deserves attentive\r\nconsideration. Indeed the work of Salmon Portland Chase, Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, forms a bridge, as one might say, between the first and\r\nsecond phases of Lincoln's administration.\r\n\r\nThe interesting Englishman who is the latest biographer of Lincoln says\r\nof Chase: \"Unfortunately, this imposing person was a sneak.\" But is\r\nLord Charnwood justified in that surprising characterization? He finds\r\nsupport in the testimony of Secretary Welles, who calls Chase, \"artful\r\ndodger, unstable, and unreliable.\" And yet there is another side, for\r\nit is the conventional thing in America to call him our greatest finance\r\nminister since Hamilton, and even a conspicuous enemy said of him, at a\r\ncrucial moment, that his course established his character \"as an honest\r\nand frank man.\"\r\n\r\nTaking these contradictory estimates as hints of a contradiction in the\r\nman, we are forced to the conclusion that Chase was a professional\r\nin politics and an amateur in finance. Perhaps herein is the whole\r\nexplanation of the two characteristics of his financial policy--his\r\nreluctance to lay taxes, and his faith in loans. His two eyes did not\r\nsee things alike. One was really trying to make out the orthodox path\r\nof finance; the other was peering along the more devious road of popular\r\ncaprice.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the war caught the Treasury, as it caught all branches of\r\nthe Government, utterly unprepared. Between April and July, 1861, Chase\r\nhad to borrow what he could. When Congress met in July, his real career\r\nas director of financial policy began--or, as his enemies think, failed\r\nto begin. At least, he failed to urge upon Congress the need of new\r\ntaxes and appeared satisfied with himself asking for an issue of\r\n$240,000,000 in bonds bearing not less than seven per cent interest.\r\nCongress voted to give him $250,000,000 of which $50,000,000 might be\r\ninterest-bearing treasury notes; made slight increases in duties; and\r\nPrepared for excise and direct taxation the following year. Later in\r\nthe year Congress laid a three per cent tax on all incomes in excess of\r\n$800.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress reassembled in December, 1861, expenditures were racing\r\nahead of receipts, and there was a deficit of $143,000,000. It must not\r\nbe forgotten that this month was a time of intense excitability and of\r\nnervous reaction. Fremont had lately been removed, and the attack on\r\nCameron had begun. At this crucial moment the situation was made still\r\nmore alarming by the action of the New York banks, followed by all other\r\nbanks, in suspending specie payments. They laid the responsibility upon\r\nChase. A syndicate of banks in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia had\r\ncome to the aid of the Government, but when they took up government\r\nbonds, Chase had required them to pay the full value cash down, though\r\nthey had asked permission to hold the money on deposit and to pay it as\r\nneeded on requisition by the Government. Furthermore, in spite of their\r\nprotest, Chase issued treasury notes, which the banks had to receive\r\nfrom their depositors, who nevertheless continued to demand specie.\r\nOn January 1, 1862, the banks owed $459,000,000 and had in specie only\r\n$87,000,000. Chase defended his course by saying that the financial\r\ncrisis was not due to his policy--or lack of policy, as it would now\r\nseem--but to a general loss of faith in the outcome of the war.\r\n\r\nThere now arose a moral crisis for this \"imposing person\" who was\r\nSecretary of the Treasury--a crisis with regard to which there are\r\nstill differences of opinion. While he faced his problem silently, the\r\nCommittee on Ways and Means in the House took the matter in hand: Its\r\nsolution was an old one which all sound theorists on finance unite in\r\ncondemning--the issue of irredeemable paper money. And what did the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury do? Previously, as Governor of Ohio, he had\r\ndenounced paper money as, in effect, a fraud upon society. Long after,\r\nwhen the tide of fortune had landed him in the high place of Supreme\r\nJustice, he returned to this view and condemned as unconstitutional the\r\nlaw of 1862 establishing a system of paper money. But at the time\r\nwhen that law was passed Chase, though he went through the form of\r\nprotesting, soon acquiesced. Before long he was asking Congress to allow\r\na further issue of what he had previously called \"fraudulent\" money.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question whether Chase should have stuck to his\r\nprinciples and resigned rather than acquiesce in the paper money\r\nlegislation turns on that other question--how were the politician and\r\nthe financier related in his make-up?\r\n\r\nBefore Congress and the Secretary had finished, $450,000,000 were\r\nissued. Prices naturally rose, and there was speculation in gold. Even\r\nbefore the first issue of paper money, the treasury notes had been\r\nslightly below par. In January, 1863, a hundred dollars in paper would\r\nbring, in New York, only $69.00 in gold; a year later, after falling,\r\nrising, and falling again, the value was $64.00; in July and August,\r\n1864, it was at its lowest, $39.00; when the war closed, it had risen to\r\n$67.00. There was powerful protest against the legislation responsible\r\nfor such a condition of affairs. Justin Morrill, the author of the\r\nMorrill tariff, said, \"I would as soon provide Chinese wooden guns\r\nfor the army as paper money alone for the army. It will be a breach of\r\npublic faith. It will injure creditors; it will increase prices; it will\r\nincrease many fold the cost of the war.\" Recent students agree, in the\r\nmain, that his prophecies were fulfilled; and a common estimate of the\r\nprobable increase in the cost of the war through the use of paper money\r\nand the consequent inflation of prices is $600,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere was much more financial legislation in 1862; but Chase continued\r\nto stand aside and allow Congress the lead in establishing an excise\r\nlaw, an increase in the income tax, and a higher tariff--the last of\r\nwhich was necessitated by the excise law which has been described as a\r\nbill \"that taxed everything.\" To enable American manufacturers to bear\r\nthe excise duties levied upon their business, protection was evoked\r\nto secure them the possession of their field by excluding foreign\r\ncompetition. All these taxes, however, produced but a fraction of the\r\nGovernment's revenue. Borrowing, the favorite method of the Secretary,\r\nwas accepted by Congress as the main resource. It is computed that\r\nby means of taxation there was raised in the course of the war\r\n$667,163,247.00, while during the same period the Government borrowed\r\n$2,621,916,786.00.\r\n\r\nWhatever else he may think of Chase, no one denies that in 1862 he had\r\nother interests besides finance. Lincoln's Cabinet in those days was\r\nfar from an harmonious body. All through its history there was a Chase\r\nfaction and a Seward faction. The former had behind them the Radical\r\nRepublicans, while the latter relied upon the support of the moderates.\r\nThis division in the Republican party runs deep through the politics\r\nof the time. There seems to be good reason to think that Chase was not\r\ntaken by surprise when his radical allies in Congress, in December,\r\n1862, demanded of Lincoln the removal of Seward. It will be remembered\r\nthat the elections of the autumn of 1862 had gone against Lincoln. At\r\nthis moment of dismay, the friends of Chase struck their blow. Seward\r\ninstantly offered his resignation. But Lincoln skillfully temporized.\r\nThereupon, Chase also resigned. Judging from the scanty evidence we have\r\nof his intention, we may conclude that he thought he had Lincoln in\r\na corner and that he expected either to become first minister or the\r\navowed chief of an irresistible opposition. But he seems to have gone\r\ntoo fast for his followers. Lincoln had met them, together with his\r\nCabinet, in a conference in December, 1862, and frankly discussed the\r\nsituation, with the result that some of them wavered. When Lincoln\r\ninformed both Seward and Chase that he declined to accept their\r\nresignations, both returned--Seward with alacrity, Chase with\r\nreluctance. One of the clues to Lincoln's cabinet policy was his\r\ndetermination to keep both these factions committed to the Government,\r\nwithout allowing himself to be under the thumb of either.\r\n\r\nDuring the six months following the cabinet crisis Chase appears at\r\nhis best. A stupendous difficulty lay before him and he attacked it\r\nmanfully. The Government's deficit was $276,900,000. Of the loans\r\nauthorized in 1862--the \"five-twenties\" as they were called, bringing\r\nsix per cent and to run from five to twenty years at the Government's\r\npleasure---the sales had brought in, to December, 1862, only\r\n$23,750,000, though five hundred million had been expected. The banks in\r\ndeclining to handle these bonds laid the blame on the Secretary, who had\r\ninsisted that all purchasers should take them at par.\r\n\r\nIt is not feasible, in a work of this character, to enter into the\r\ncomplexities of the financial situation of 1863, or to determine just\r\nwhat influences caused a revolution in the market for government bonds.\r\nBut two factors must be mentioned. Chase was induced to change his\r\nattitude and to sell to banks large numbers of bonds at a rate below\r\npar, thus enabling the banks to dispose of them at a profit. He also\r\ncalled to his aid Jay Cooke, an experienced banker, who was allowed a\r\ncommission of one-half per cent on all bonds sold up to $10,000,000 and\r\nthree-eighths of one per cent after that. Cooke organized a countrywide\r\nagency system, with twenty-five hundred subagents through whom he\r\noffered directly to the people bonds in small denominations. By all\r\nmanner of devices, patriotism and the purchase of bonds were made to\r\nappear the same thing, and before the end of the year $400,000,000\r\nin five-twenty bonds had been sold. This campaign to dispose of the\r\nfive-twenties was the turning-point in war finance, and later borrowings\r\nencountered no such difficulties as those of 1862 and 1863.\r\n\r\nBetter known today than this precarious legislation is the famous Act\r\nof 1863, which was amended in the next year and which forms the basis\r\nof our present system of national banks. To Chase himself the credit for\r\nthis seems to be due. Even in 1861 he advised Congress to establish\r\na system of national banks, and he repeated the advice before it was\r\nfinally taken. The central feature of this system which he advocated is\r\none with which we are still familiar: permission to the banks accepting\r\ngovernment supervision to deposit government bonds in the Treasury and\r\nto acquire in return the right to issue bank-notes to the amount of\r\nninety per cent of the value of the bonds.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Chase himself rated very highly his own\r\nservices to his country. Nor is there any doubt that, alone among\r\nLincoln's close associates, he continued until the end to believe\r\nhimself a better man than the President. He and his radical following\r\nmade no change in their attitude to Lincoln, though Chase pursued\r\na course of confidential criticism which has since inspired the\r\ncharacterization of him as a \"sneak,\" while his followers were more\r\noutspoken. In the summer of 1863 Chase was seriously talked of as the\r\nnext President, and before the end of the year Chase clubs were being\r\norganized in all the large cities to promote his candidacy. Chase\r\nhimself took the adroit position of not believing that any President\r\nshould serve a second term.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1864 the Chase organization sent out a confidential circular\r\nsigned by Senator Pomeroy of Kansas setting forth the case against\r\nLincoln as a candidate and the case in favor of Chase. Unfortunately\r\nfor Chase, this circular fell into the hands of a newspaper and was\r\npublished. Chase at once wrote to Lincoln denying any knowledge of the\r\ncircular but admitting his candidacy and offering his resignation. No\r\nmore remarkable letter was written by Lincoln than his reply to Chase,\r\nin which he showed that he had long fully understood the situation, and\r\nwhich he closed with these words: \"Whether you shall remain at the head\r\nof the Treasury Department is a question which I do not allow myself\r\nto consider from any standpoint other than my judgment of the public\r\nservice, and, in that view, I do not perceive occasion for change.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chase boom rapidly declined. The deathblow was given by a caucus of\r\nthe Union members of the legislature of his own State nominating Lincoln\r\n\"at the demand of the people and the soldiers of Ohio.\" The defeat\r\nembittered Chase. For several months, however, he continued in the\r\nCabinet, and during this time he had the mortification of seeing Lincoln\r\nrenominated in the National Union Convention amid a great display of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMore than once in the past, Chase had offered his resignation. On one\r\noccasion Lincoln had gone to his house and had begged him to reconsider\r\nhis decision. Soon after the renomination, Chase again offered his\r\nresignation upon the pretext of a disagreement with the President over\r\nappointments to office. This time, however, Lincoln felt the end had\r\ncome and accepted the resignation. Chase's successor in the Treasury was\r\nWilliam Pitt Fessenden, Senator from Maine. During most of the summer\r\nof 1864 Chase stood aside, sullen and envious, watching the progress of\r\nLincoln toward a second election. So much did his bitterness affect his\r\njudgment that he was capable of writing in his diary his belief that\r\nLincoln meant to reverse his policy and consent to peace with slavery\r\nreestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. NORTHERN LIFE DURING THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe real effects of war on the life of nations is one of those old and\r\ncomplicated debates which lie outside the scope of a volume such as\r\nthis. Yet in the particular case of the Northern people it is imperative\r\nto answer two questions both of which have provoked interminable\r\ndiscussion: Was the moral life of the North good or bad in the war\r\nyears? Was its commercial life sound?\r\n\r\nAs to the moral question, contemporary evidence seems at first sight\r\ncontradictory. The very able Englishman who represented the \"Times\",\r\nWilliam H. Russell, gives this ugly picture of an American city in 1863:\r\n\r\n\"Every fresh bulletin from the battlefield of Chickamauga, during my\r\nthree weeks' stay in Cincinnati, brought a long list of the dead and\r\nwounded of the Western army, many of whom, of the officers, belonged to\r\nthe best families of the place. Yet the signs of mourning were hardly\r\nanywhere perceptible; the noisy gaiety of the town was not abated one\r\njot.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a private manuscript of a Cincinnati family describes\r\nthe \"intense gloom hanging over the city like a pall\" during the period\r\nof that dreadful battle. The memories of old people at Cincinnati in\r\nafter days--if they had belonged to the \"loyal\" party--contained only\r\nsad impressions of a city that was one great hospital where \"all\r\nour best people\" worked passionately as volunteer assistants of the\r\ngovernment medical corps.\r\n\r\nA third fact to be borne in mind in connection with this apparent\r\ncontradiction in evidence is the source of the greater fortunes of\r\nCincinnati, a large proportion of which are to be traced, directly or\r\nindirectly to government contracts during the war. In some cases the\r\nmerciless indifference of the Cincinnati speculators to the troubles\r\nof their country are a local scandal to this day, and it is still told,\r\nsometimes with scorn, sometimes with amusement, how perhaps the greatest\r\nof these fortunes was made by forcing up the price of iron at a time\r\nwhen the Government had to have iron, cost what it might.\r\n\r\nThus we no sooner take up the moral problem of the times than we find\r\nourselves involved in the commercial question, for here, as always,\r\nmorals and business are intertwined. Was the commercial management of\r\nthe North creditable to the Government and an honor to the people? The\r\nsurest way to answer such questions is to trace out with some fullness\r\nthe commercial and industrial conditions of the North during the four\r\nyears of war.\r\n\r\nThe general reader who looks for the first time into the matter is\r\nlikely to be staggered by what statistics seem to say. Apparently they\r\ncontradict what he is accustomed to hear from popular economists about\r\nthe waste of war. He has been told in the newspapers that business is\r\nundermined by the withdrawal of great numbers of men from \"productive\"\r\nconsumption of the fruits of labor and their engagement as soldiers in\r\n\"unproductive\" consumption. But, to his astonishment, he finds that the\r\nstatistics of 1861-1865 show much increase in Northern business--as,\r\nfor example, in 1865, the production of 142 million pounds of wool\r\nagainst 60 million in 1860. The government reports show that 13 million\r\ntons of coal were mined in 1860 and 21 million in 1864; in 1860, the\r\noutput of pig iron was 821,000 tons, and 1,014,282 tons in 1864; the\r\npetroleum production rose from 21 million gallons in 1860 to 128\r\nmillion in 1862; the export of corn, measured in money, shows for 1860\r\na business of $2,399,808 compared with $10,592,704 for 1863; wheat\r\nexporting showed, also, an enormous increase, rising from 14 millions\r\nin 1860 to 46 millions in 1863. There are, to be sure, many statistics\r\nwhich seem to contradict these. Some of them will be mentioned\r\npresently. And yet, on the whole, it seems safe to conclude that the\r\nNorth, at the close of the third year of war was producing more and was\r\nreceiving larger profits than in 1860.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this subject in its entirety would lead us into the\r\nlabyrinths of complex economic theory, yet two or three simple facts\r\nappear so plain that even the mere historian may venture to set them\r\nforth. When we look into the statistics which seem to show a general\r\nincrease of business during the war, we find that in point of fact this\r\nincrease was highly specialized. All those industries that dealt with\r\nthe physical necessities of life and all those that dealt peculiarly\r\nwith armies flourished amazingly. And yet there is another side to the\r\nstory, for there were other industries that were set back and some that\r\nalmost, if not entirely, disappeared. A good instance is the manufacture\r\nof cotton cloth. When the war opened, 200,000 hands were employed in\r\nthis manufacture in New England. With the sealing up of the South and\r\nthe failure of the cotton supply, their work temporarily ceased. What\r\nbecame of the workmen? Briefly, one of three things happened: some went\r\ninto other trades, such as munitions, in which the war had created an\r\nabnormal demand for labor; a great number of them became soldiers; and\r\nmany of them went West and became farmers or miners. Furthermore,\r\nmany whose trades were not injured by the war left their jobs and fled\r\nwestward to escape conscription. Their places were left open to be\r\nfilled by operatives from the injured trades. In one or another of\r\nthese ways the laborer who was thrown out of work was generally able to\r\nrecover employment. But it is important to remember that the key to the\r\nlabor situation at that time was the vast area of unoccupied land which\r\ncould be had for nothing or next to nothing. This fact is brought\r\nhome by a comparison of the situation of the American with that of the\r\nEnglish workman during the cotton famine. According to its own ideas\r\nEngland was then fully cultivated. There was no body of land waiting\r\nto be thrown open, as an emergency device, to a host of new-made\r\nagriculturists. When the cotton-mills stopped at Manchester, their\r\noperatives had practically no openings but in other industrial\r\noccupations. As such opportunities were lacking, they became objects of\r\ncharity until they could resume their work. As a country with a great\r\nreserve of unoccupied land, the United States was singularly fortunate\r\nat this economic crisis.\r\n\r\nOne of the noteworthy features of Northern life during the war is that\r\nthere was no abnormal increase in pauperism. A great deal has been\r\nwritten upon the extensive charities of the time, but the term is\r\nwrongly applied, for what is really referred to is the volunteer aid\r\ngiven to the Government in supporting the armies. This was done on\r\na vast scale, by all classes of the population--that is, by all who\r\nsupported the Union party, for the separation between the two parties\r\nwas bitter and unforgiving. But of charity in the ordinary sense of the\r\ncare of the destitute there was no significant increase because there\r\nwas no peculiar need. Here again the fact that the free land could\r\nbe easily reached is the final explanation. There was no need for the\r\nunemployed workman to become a pauper. He could take advantage of the\r\nHomestead Act*, which was passed in 1862, and acquire a farm of 160\r\nacres free; or he could secure at almost nominal cost farm-land\r\nwhich had been given to railways as an inducement to build. Under the\r\nHomestead Act, the Government gave away land amounting to 2,400,000\r\nacres before the close of the war. The Illinois Central alone sold to\r\nactual settlers 221,000 acres in 1863 and 264,000 in 1864. It was during\r\nthe war, too, that the great undertaking of the transcontinental railway\r\nwas begun, partly for military and partly for commercial reasons. In\r\nthis project, both as a field of labor and as a stimulus to Western\r\nsettlement, there is also to be found one more device for the relief of\r\nthe labor situation in the East.\r\n\r\n     *This Act, which may be regarded as the culmination of the\r\n     long battle of the Northern dreamers to win \"land for the\r\n     landless,\" provided that every settler who was, or intended\r\n     to be, a citizen might secure 180 acres of government land\r\n     by living on it and cultivating it for five years.\r\n\r\nThere is no more important phenomenon of the time than the shifting of\r\nlarge masses of population from the East to the West, while the war was\r\nin progress. This fact begins to indicate why there was no shortage in\r\nthe agricultural output. The North suffered acutely from inflation of\r\nprices and from a speculative wildness that accompanied the inflation,\r\nbut it did not suffer from a lack of those things that are produced by\r\nthe soil--food, timber, metals, and coal. In addition to the reason just\r\nmentioned--the search for new occupation by Eastern labor which had\r\nbeen thrown out of employment--three other causes helped to maintain the\r\nefficiency of work in the mines, in the forests, and on the farms. These\r\nthree factors were immigration, the labor of women, and labor-saving\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nImmigration, naturally, fell off to a certain degree but it did not\r\nbecome altogether negligible. It is probable that 110,000 able-bodied\r\nmen came into the country while war was in progress--a poor offset\r\nto the many hundred thousand who became soldiers, but nevertheless a\r\ncontribution that counted for something.\r\n\r\nVastly more important, in the work of the North, was the part taken by\r\nwomen. A pathetic detail with which in our own experience the world has\r\nagain become familiar was the absence of young men throughout most\r\nof the North, and the presence of women new to the work in many\r\noccupations, especially farming. A single quotation from a home\r\nmissionary in Iowa tells the whole story:\r\n\r\n\"I will mention that I met more women driving teams on the road and saw\r\nmore at work in the fields than men. They seem to have said to their\r\nhusbands in the language of a favorite song,\r\n\r\n     'Just take your gun and go;\r\n     For Ruth can drive the oxen, John,\r\n     And I can use the hoe!'\r\n\r\n\"I went first to Clarinda, and the town seemed deserted. Upon inquiry\r\nfor former friends, the frequent answer was, 'In the army.' From\r\nHawleyville almost all the thoroughly loyal male inhabitants had gone;\r\nand in one township beyond, where I formerly preached, there are but\r\nseven men left, and at Quincy, the county seat of Adams County, but\r\nfive.\"\r\n\r\nEven more important than the change in the personnel of labor were the\r\nnew machines of the day. During the fifteen years previous to the war\r\nAmerican ingenuity had reached a high point. Such inventions as the\r\nsewing machine and the horse-reaper date in their practical forms from\r\nthat period, and both of these helped the North to fight the war. Their\r\nfurther improvement, and the extension of the principles involved to\r\nmany new forms of machinery, sprang from the pressing need to make up\r\nfor the loss of men who were drained by the army from the farms and the\r\nworkshops. It was the horse-reaper, the horse-rake, the horse-thresher\r\nthat enabled women and boys to work the farms while husbands, fathers,\r\nand elder brothers were at the front.\r\n\r\nAll these causes maintained Northern farming at a high pitch of\r\nproductivity. This efficiency is implied in some of the figures already\r\nquoted, but many others could be cited. For example, in 1859, the total\r\nproduction of wheat for the whole country was 173 million bushels; in\r\n1862, the North alone produced 177 millions; even in 1864, with over a\r\nmillion men under arms, it still produced 160 million bushels.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the great Northern army produced nothing\r\nwhile it consumed the products of agriculture and manufacture--food,\r\nclothing, arms, ammunition, cannon, wagons, horses, medical stores--at\r\na rate that might have led a poetical person to imagine the army as\r\na devouring dragon. Who, in the last analysis, provided all these\r\nsupplies? Who paid the soldiers? Who supplemented their meager pay and\r\nsupported their families? The people, of course; and they did so both\r\ndirectly and indirectly. In taxes and loans they paid to the Government\r\nabout three thousand millions of dollars. Their indirect assistance was\r\nperhaps as great, though it is impossible today to estimate with any\r\napproach to accuracy the amount either in money or service. Among\r\nobvious items are the collections made by the Sanitary Commission for\r\nthe benefit of the hospital service, amounting to twenty-five million\r\ndollars, and about six millions raised by the Christian Commission. In\r\na hundred other ways both individuals and localities strained their\r\nresources to supplement those of the Government. Immense subscription\r\nlists were circulated to raise funds for the families of soldiers. The\r\ncity of Philadelphia alone spent in this way in a single year $600,000.\r\nThere is also evidence of a vast amount of unrecorded relief of\r\nneedy families by the neighbors, and in the farming districts, such\r\nassistance, particularly in the form of fuel during winter, was very\r\ngenerally given.\r\n\r\nWhat made possible this enormous total of contributions was, in a word,\r\nthe general willingness of those supporting the war to forego luxuries.\r\nThey ceased buying a great multitude of unnecessary things. But\r\nwhat became of the labor that had previously supplied the demand for\r\nluxuries? A part of it went the way of all other Northern labor--into\r\nnew trades, into the army, or to the West--and a part continued to\r\nmanufacture luxuries: for their market, though curtailed, was not\r\ndestroyed. There were, indeed, two populations in the North, and they\r\nwere separated by an emotional chasm. Had all the North been a unit in\r\nfeeling, the production of articles of luxury might have ceased.\r\nBecause of this emotional division of the North, however, this business\r\nsurvived; for the sacrifice of luxurious expenditure was made by only a\r\npart of the population, even though it was the majority.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the whole matter was adjusted voluntarily without\r\nsystematic government direction, since there was nothing in the\r\nfinancial policy of the Government to correspond to conscription.\r\nConsequently, both in the way of loans and in the way of contributions,\r\nas well as in the matter of unpaid service, the entire burden fell\r\nupon the war party alone. In the absence of anything like economic\r\nconscription, if such a phrase may be used, those Northerners who did\r\nnot wish to lend money, or to make financial sacrifice, or to give\r\nunpaid service, were free to pursue their own bent. The election of 1864\r\nshowed that they formed a market which amounted to something between six\r\nand nine millions. There is no reason to suppose that these millions in\r\n1864 spent less on luxuries than they did in 1860. Two or three items\r\nare enough. In 1860, the importation of silk amounted to 32 million\r\ndollars; in 1862, in spite of inflated prices, it had shrunk to 7\r\nmillions; the consumption of malt liquors shrank from 101 million\r\ngallons in 1860 to 62 million gallons in 1863; of coffee, hardly to be\r\nclassed as a luxury, there were consumed in 1861, 184 million pounds and\r\nin 1863, 80 millions.\r\n\r\nThe clue to the story of capital is to be found in this fact, too often\r\nforgotten, that there was an economic-political division cutting deep\r\nthrough every stratum of the Northern people. Their economic life\r\nas well as their political life was controlled on the one hand by a\r\ndevotion to the cause of the war, and on the other hand by a hatred\r\nof that cause or by cynical indifference. And we cannot insist too\r\npositively that the Government failed very largely to take this fact\r\ninto account. The American spirit of invention, so conspicuous at that\r\ntime in mechanics, did not apply itself to the science of government.\r\nLincoln confessedly was not a financier; his instinct was at home only\r\nin problems that could be stated in terms of men. Witness his acceptance\r\nof conscription and his firmness in carrying it through, as a result\r\nof which he saved the patriotic party from bearing the whole burden of\r\nmilitary service. But there was no parallel conservation of power in the\r\nfield of industry. The financial policy, left in the hands of Chase, may\r\ntruly be described as barren of ideas. Incidentally, it may be mentioned\r\nthat the \"loyal\" North was left at the mercy of its domestic enemies and\r\na prey to parasites by Chase's policy of loans instead of taxes and of\r\nvoluntary support instead of enforced support.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this financial policy was an immense opportunity for\r\nthe \"disloyally\" and the parasites to make huge war profits out of the\r\n\"loyals\" and the Government. Of course, it must not be supposed that\r\neveryone who seized the chance to feather his nest was so careless or so\r\nimpolitic as to let himself be classed as a \"disloyal.\" An incident of\r\nthe autumn of 1861 shows the temper of those professed \"loyals\" who were\r\nreally parasites. The background of the incident is supplied by a report\r\nof the Quartermaster-General:\r\n\r\n\"Governors daily complain that recruiting will stop unless clothing is\r\nsent in abundance and immediately to the various recruiting camps and\r\nregiments. With every exertion, this department has not been able to\r\nobtain clothing to supply these demands, and they have been so urgent\r\nthat troops before the enemy have been compelled to do picket duty in\r\nthe late cold nights without overcoats, or even coats, wearing only thin\r\nsummer flannel blouses.... Could 150,000 suits of clothing, overcoats,\r\ncoats, and pantaloons be placed today, in depot, it would scarce supply\r\nthe calls now before us. They would certainly leave no surplus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government attempted to meet this difficulty in the shortest\r\npossible time by purchasing clothing abroad. But such disregard of home\r\nindustry, the \"patriotism\" of the New England manufacturers could not\r\nendure. Along with the report just quoted, the Quartermaster-General\r\nforwarded to the Secretary of War a long argumentative protest from\r\na committee of the Boston Board of Trade against the purchase of army\r\nclothing in Europe. Any American of the present day can guess how\r\nthe protest was worded and what arguments were used. Stripped of its\r\ninsincerity, it signified this: the cotton mills were inoperative for\r\nlack of material; their owners saw no chance to save their dividends\r\nexcept by re-equipment as woolen mills; the existing woolen mills also saw\r\na great chance to force wool upon the market as a substitute for cotton.\r\nIn Ohio, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, the growers of wool saw\r\nthe opportunity with equal clearness. But, one and all, these various\r\ngroups of parasites saw that their game hinged on one condition: the\r\nmunitions market must be kept open until they were ready to monopolize\r\ngovernment contracts. If soldiers contracted pneumonia doing picket duty\r\non cold nights, in their summer blouses, that was but an unfortunate\r\nincident of war.\r\n\r\nVery different in spirit from the protest of the Boston manufacturers\r\nis a dispatch from the American minister at Brussels which shows what\r\nAmerican public servants, in contrast with American manufacturers, were\r\nabout. Abroad the agents of North and South were fighting a commercial\r\nduel in which each strove to monopolize the munitions market. The United\r\nStates Navy, seeing things from an angle entirely different from that of\r\nthe Boston Board of Trade, ably seconded the ministers by blockading the\r\nSouthern ports and by thus preventing the movement of specie and cotton\r\nto Europe. As a consequence, fourmonth notes which had been given by\r\nSouthern agents with their orders fell due, had to be renewed, and\r\nbegan to be held in disfavor. Agents of the North, getting wind of\r\nthese hitches in negotiations, eagerly sought to take over the unpaid\r\nConfederate orders. All these details of the situation help to explain\r\nthe jubilant tone of this dispatch from Brussels late in November, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"I have now in my hands complete control of the principal rebel\r\ncontracts on the continent, viz.: 206,000 yards of cloth ready for\r\ndelivery, already commencing to move forward to Havre; gray but can\r\nbe dyed blue in twenty days; 100,000 yards deliverable from 15th of\r\nDecember to 26th of January, light blue army cloth, same as ours;\r\n100,000 blankets; 40,000 guns to be shipped in ten days; 20,000 saber\r\nbayonets to be delivered in six weeks.... The winter clothing for\r\n100,000 men taken out of their hands, when they cannot replace it, would\r\nalmost compensate for Bull Run. There is no considerable amount of cloth\r\nto be had in Europe; the stocks are very short.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War was as devoid of ideas as the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury was and even less equipped with resisting power. Though he\r\ncould not undo the work already done by the agents of the Government\r\nabroad, he gave way as rapidly as possible to the allied parasites whose\r\nheadquarters, at the moment, were in Boston. The story grows uglier\r\nas we proceed. Two powerful commercial combinations took charge of the\r\npolicy of the woolen interests--the National Woolgrowers' Association\r\nand the National Association of Wool Manufacturers, which were soon in\r\ncontrol of this immense industry. Woolen mills sprang up so fast that\r\na report of the New York Chamber of Commerce pronounced their increase\r\n\"scarcely credible.\" So great was the new market created by the\r\nGovernment demand, and so ruthless were the parasites in forcing up\r\nprices, that dividends on mill stock rose to 10, 15, 25, and even 40 per\r\ncent. And all the while the wool growers and the wool manufacturers were\r\nclamoring to Congress for protection of the home industry, exclusion\r\nof the wicked foreign competition, and all in the name of their devoted\r\n\"patriotism\"--patriotism with a dividend of 40 per cent!\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not meant that every wool grower and every woolen\r\nmanufacturer was either a \"disloyal\" or a parasite. By no means. Numbers\r\nof them were to be found in that great host of \"loyals\" who put their\r\ndividends into government bonds and gave their services unpaid as\r\nauxiliaries of the Commissary Department or the Hospital Service of\r\nthe Army. What is meant is that the abnormal conditions of industry,\r\nuncorrected by the Government, afforded a glaring opportunity for\r\nunscrupulous men of business who, whatever their professions, cared a\r\nhundred times more for themselves than for their country. To these\r\nwas due the pitiless hampering of the army in the interest of the\r\nwool-trade. For example, many uniforms paid for at outrageous prices,\r\nturned out to be made of a miserable cheap fabric, called \"shoddy,\"\r\nwhich resisted weather scarcely better than paper. This fraud gave\r\nthe word \"shoddy\" its present significance in our American speech and\r\nproduced the phrase--applied to manufacturers newly become rich--\"shoddy\r\naristocracy.\" An even more shameful result of the selfishness of the\r\nmanufacturers and of the weakness of the Government was the use of cloth\r\nfor uniforms not of the regulation colors, with the result that soldiers\r\nsometimes fired upon their comrades by mistake.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the capitalists who financed the woolen business did\r\nnot extend to the labor employed in it. One of the ugliest details of\r\nthe time was the resolute attempt of the parasites to seize the whole\r\namount of the abnormal profits they wrung from the Government and from\r\nthe people. For it must not be forgotten that the whole nation had to\r\npay their prices. It is estimated that prices in the main advanced about\r\n100 per cent while wages were not advanced more than sixty per cent.\r\nIt is not strange that these years of war form a period of bitter\r\nantagonism between labor and capital.\r\n\r\nWhat went on in the woolen business is to be found more or less in every\r\nbusiness. Immense fortunes sprang up over night. They had but two\r\nroots: government contracts and excessive profits due to war prices. The\r\ngigantic fortunes which characterized the North at the end of the war\r\nare thus accounted for. The so-called prosperity of the time was a\r\nclass prosperity and was absorbed by parasites who fattened upon the\r\nnecessities of the Government and the sacrifices of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE MEXICAN EPISODE\r\n\r\nThat French demagogue whom Victor Hugo aptly called Napoleon the Little\r\nwas a prime factor in the history of the Union and the Confederacy. The\r\nConfederate side of his intrigue will be told in its proper place. Here,\r\nlet us observe him from the point of view of Washington.\r\n\r\nIt is too much to attempt to pack into a sentence or two the complicated\r\ndrama of deceit, lies, and graft, through which he created at last a\r\npretext for intervention in the affairs of Mexico; it is enough that in\r\nthe autumn of 1862 a French army of invasion marched from Vera Cruz upon\r\nMexico City. We have already seen that about this same time Napoleon\r\nproposed to England and Russia a joint intervention with France between\r\nNorth and South--a proposal which, however, was rejected. This Mexican\r\nventure explains why the plan was suggested at that particular time.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in England and Russia, Napoleon unexpectedly received\r\nencouragement, as he thought, from within the United States through the\r\nmedium of the eccentric editor of the \"New York Tribune\". We shall\r\nhave occasion to return later to the adventures of Horace Greeley--that\r\nerratic individual who has many good and generous acts to his credit, as\r\nwell as many foolish ones. For the present we have to note that toward\r\nthe close of 1862 he approached the French Ambassador at Washington\r\nwith a request for imperial mediation between the North and the South.\r\nGreeley was a type of American that no European can understand: he\r\nbelieved in talk, and more talk, and still more talk, as the cure for\r\nearthly ills. He never could understand that anybody besides himself\r\ncould have strong convictions. When he told the Ambassador that the\r\nEmperor's mediation would lead to a reconciliation of the sections, he\r\nwas doubtless sincere in his belief. The astute European diplomat, who\r\ncould not believe such simplicity, thought it a mask. When he asked for,\r\nand received, permission to pass the Federal lines and visit Richmond,\r\nhe interpreted the permit in the light of his assumption about Greeley.\r\nAt Richmond, he found no desire for reunion. Putting this and that\r\ntogether, he concluded that the North wanted to give up the fight\r\nand would welcome mediation to save its face. The dreadful defeat at\r\nFredericksburg fell in with this reasoning. His reports on American\r\nconditions led Napoleon, in January, 1863, to attempt alone what he had\r\nonce hoped to do supported by England and Russia. He proposed his good\r\noffices to the Government at Washington as a mediator between North and\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nHitherto, Washington had been very discreet about Mexico. Adroit hints\r\nnot to go too far had been given Napoleon in full measure, but there was\r\nno real protest. The State Department now continued this caution and in\r\nthe most polite terms declined Napoleon's offer. Congress, however, took\r\nthe matter more grimly, for throughout the dealings with Napoleon, it\r\nhad been at odds with Lincoln. It now passed the first of a series of\r\nresolutions which expressed the will of the country, if not quite\r\nthe will of the President, by resolving that any further proposal of\r\nmediation would be regarded by it as \"an unfriendly act.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon then resumed his scheming for joint intervention, while in\r\nthe meantime his armies continued to fight their way until they entered\r\nMexico City in June, 1863. The time had now come when Napoleon thought\r\nit opportune to show his hand. Those were the days when Lee appeared\r\ninvincible, and when Chancellorsville crowned a splendid series of\r\ntriumphs. In England, the Southern party made a fresh start; and\r\nsocieties were organized to aid the Confederacy. At Liverpool,\r\nLaird Brothers were building, ostensibly for France, really for the\r\nConfederacy, two ironclads supposed to outclass every ship in the\r\nNorthern navy. In France, 100,000 unemployed cotton hands were rioting\r\nfor food. To raise funds for the Confederacy the great Erlanger\r\nbanking-house of Paris negotiated a loan based on cotton which was to\r\nbe delivered after the breaking of the blockade. Napoleon dreamed of a\r\nshattered American union, two enfeebled republics, and a broad way for\r\nhis own scheme in Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn June an English politician of Southern sympathies, Edward Roebuck,\r\nwent over to France, was received by the Emperor, and came to an\r\nunderstanding with him. Roebuck went home to report to the Southern\r\nparty that Napoleon was ready to intervene, and that all he waited for\r\nwas England's cooperation. A motion \"to enter into negotiations with the\r\nGreat Powers of Europe for the purpose of obtaining their cooperation\r\nin the recognition\" of the Confederacy was introduced by Roebuck in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe debate which followed was the last chance of the Southern party\r\nand, as events proved, the last chance of Napoleon. How completely the\r\nBritish ministry was now committed to the North appears in the fact that\r\nGladstone, for the Government, opposed Roebuck's motion. John Bright\r\nattacked it in what Lord Morley calls \"perhaps the most powerful and the\r\nnoblest speech of his life.\" The Southern party was hardly resolute in\r\ntheir support of Roebuck and presently he withdrew his motion.\r\n\r\nBut there were still the ironclads at Liverpool. We have seen that\r\nearlier in the war, the carelessness of the British authorities had\r\npermitted the escape of ship 290, subsequently known as the Confederate\r\ncommerce-destroyer, Alabama. The authorities did not wish to allow a\r\nrepetition of the incident. But could it be shown that the Laird\r\nships were not really for a French purchaser? It was in the course\r\nof diplomatic conversations that Mr. Adams, speaking of the possible\r\nsailing of the ships, made a remark destined to become famous: \"It would\r\nbe superfluous in me to point out to your lordship that this is war.\" At\r\njest, the authorities were satisfied. The ships were seized and in the\r\nend bought for the British Navy.\r\n\r\nAgain Napoleon stood alone. Not only had he failed to obtain aid\r\nfrom abroad, but in France itself his Mexican schemes were widely and\r\nbitterly condemned. Yet he had gone too far to recede, and what he\r\nhad been aiming at all along was now revealed. An assembly of Mexican\r\nnotables, convened by the general of the invaders, voted to set up an\r\nimperial government and offered the crown to Napoleon's nominee, the\r\nArchduke Maximilian of Austria.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Government at Washington was faced with a complicated\r\nproblem. What about the Monroe Doctrine? Did the Union dare risk war\r\nwith France? Did it dare pass over without protest the establishment\r\nof monarchy on American soil by foreign arms? Between these horns of\r\na dilemma, the Government maintained its precarious position during\r\nanother year. Seward's correspondence with Paris was a masterpiece of\r\nevasion. He neither protested against the intervention of Napoleon\r\nnor acknowledged the authority of Maximilian. Apparently, both he\r\nand Lincoln were divided between fear of a French alliance with the\r\nConfederacy and fear of premature action in the North that would render\r\nNapoleon desperate. Just how far they comprehended Napoleon and his\r\nproblems is an open question.\r\n\r\nWhether really comprehending or merely trusting to its instinct,\r\nCongress took a bolder course. Two men prove the antagonists of a\r\nparliamentary duel--Charles Sumner, chairman of the Senate Committee on\r\nForeign Relations, and Henry Winter Davis, chairman of the corresponding\r\ncommittee of the House. Sumner played the hand of the Administration.\r\nFiery resolutions demanding the evacuation of Mexico or an American\r\ndeclaration of war were skillfully buried in the silence of Sumner's\r\ncommittee. But there was nevertheless one resolution that affected\r\nhistory: it was a ringing condemnation of the attempt to establish\r\na monarchy in Mexico. In the House, a joint resolution which Davis\r\nsubmitted was passed without one dissenting vote. When it came to the\r\nSenate, Sumner buried it as he had buried earlier resolutions. None the\r\nless it went out to the world attended by the news of the unanimous vote\r\nin the House.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, the American Ambassador at Paris called upon the\r\nimperial Foreign Secretary, M. Drouyn de L'huys. News of this resolution\r\nhad preceded him. He was met by the curt question, \"Do you bring peace\r\nor war?\" Again, the Washington Government was skillfully evasive. The\r\nAmbassador was instructed to explain that the resolution had not been\r\ninspired by the President and \"the French Government would be seasonably\r\napprized of any change of policy...which the President might at any\r\nfuture time think it proper to adopt.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt that Lincoln's course was very widely condemned\r\nas timid. When we come to the political campaign of 1864, we shall\r\nmeet Henry Winter Davis among his most relentless personal enemies.\r\nDissatisfaction with Lincoln's Mexican policy has not been sufficiently\r\nconsidered in accounting for the opposition to him, inside the war\r\nparty, in 1864. To it may be traced an article in the platform of the\r\nwar party, adopted in June, 1864, protesting against the establishment\r\nof monarchy \"in near proximity to the United States.\" In the same month\r\nMaximilian entered Mexico City.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent moves of Napoleon are explained elsewhere.* The central\r\nfact in the story is his virtual change of attitude, in the summer of\r\n1864. The Confederate agent at Paris complained of a growing coolness.\r\nBefore the end of the summer, the Confederate Secretary of State was\r\nbitter in his denunciation of Napoleon for having deserted the South.\r\nNapoleon's puppet Maximilian refused to receive an envoy from the\r\nConfederacy. Though Washington did not formally protest against\r\nthe presence of Maximilian in Mexico, it declined to recognize his\r\nGovernment, and that Government continued unrecognized at Washington\r\nthroughout the war.\r\n\r\n     *Nathaniel W. Stephenson, \"The Day of the Confederacy\". (In\r\n     \"The Chronicles of America\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE PLEBISCITE OF 1864\r\n\r\nEvery great revolution among Anglo-Saxon people--perhaps among all\r\npeople--has produced strange types of dreamers. In America, however,\r\nneither section could claim a monopoly of such types, and even the\r\nlatter-day visionaries who can see everything in heaven and earth,\r\nexcepting fact, had their Northern and Southern originals in the time\r\nof the great American war. Among these is a strange congregation which\r\nassembled in the spring of 1864 and which has come to be known, from its\r\nplace of meeting, as the Cleveland Convention. Its coming together was\r\nthe result of a loose cooperation among several minor political groups,\r\nall of which were for the Union and the war, and violently opposed to\r\nLincoln. So far as they had a common purpose, it was to supplant Lincoln\r\nby Fremont in the next election.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was notable for the large proportion of agnostics among\r\nits members. A motion was made to amend a resolution that \"the Rebellion\r\nmust be put down\" by adding the words \"with God's assistance.\" This\r\ntouch of piety was stormily rejected. Another group represented at\r\nCleveland was made up of extreme abolitionists under the leadership of\r\nthat brilliant but disordered genius, Wendell Phillips. He sent a letter\r\ndenouncing Lincoln and pledging his support of Fremont because of the\r\nlatter's \"clearsighted statesmanship and rare military ability.\" The\r\nconvention declared itself a political party, under the style of the\r\nRadical Democracy, and nominated Fremont for President.\r\n\r\nThere was another body of dreamers, still more singular, who were also\r\nbitter opponents of Lincoln. They were, however, not in favor of war.\r\nTheir political machinery consisted of secret societies. As early as\r\n1860, the Knights of the Golden Circle were active in Indiana, where\r\nthey did yeoman service for Breckinridge. Later this society acquired\r\nsome underground influence in other States, especially in Ohio, and did\r\nits share in bringing about the victories at the polls in the autumn of\r\n1862, when the Democrats captured the Indiana legislature.\r\n\r\nThe most serious charge against the Golden Circle was complicity in an\r\nattempt to assassinate Oliver P. Morton, Governor of Indiana, who was\r\nfired at, one night, as he was leaving the state house. When Morton\r\ndemanded an investigation of the Golden Circle, the legislature refused\r\nto sanction it. On his own authority and with Federal aid he made\r\ninvestigations and published a report which, if it did not actually\r\nprove treason, came dangerously near to proof. Thereafter, this society\r\ndrops out of sight, and its members appear to have formed the new Order\r\nof the American Knights, which in its turn was eclipsed by the Sons\r\nof Liberty. There were several other such societies all organized on a\r\nmilitary plan and with a great pretense of arming their members. This,\r\nhowever, had to be done surreptitiously. Boxes of rifles purchased\r\nin the East were shipped West labeled \"Sunday-school books,\" and\r\nnegotiations were even undertaken with the Confederacy to bring in arms\r\nby way of Canada. At a meeting of the supreme council of the Sons of\r\nLiberty, in New York, February 22, 1864, it was claimed that the order\r\nhad nearly a million members, though the Government secret service\r\nconsidered half a million a more exact estimate.\r\n\r\nAs events subsequently proved, the societies were not as formidable as\r\nthese figures would imply. Most of the men who joined them seem to have\r\nbeen fanciful creatures who loved secrecy for its own sake. While real\r\nmen, North and South, were laying down their lives for their principles,\r\nthese make-believe men were holding bombastic initiations and taking\r\noaths such as this from the ritual of the American Knights: \"I do\r\nfurther solemnly promise and swear, that I will ever cherish the sublime\r\nlessons which the sacred emblems of our order suggest, and will, so far\r\nas in me lies, impart those lessons to the people of the earth, where\r\nthe mystic acorn falls from its parent bough, in whose visible firmament\r\nOrion, Arcturus, and the Pleiades ride in their cold resplendent\r\nglories, and where the Southern Cross dazzles the eye of degraded\r\nhumanity with its coruscations of golden light, fit emblem of Truth,\r\nwhile it invites our sacred order to consecrate her temples in the four\r\ncorners of the earth, where moral darkness reigns and despotism holds\r\nsway.... Divine essence, so help me that I fail not in my troth, lest\r\nI shall be summoned before the tribunal of the order, adjudged and\r\ncondemned to certain and shameful death, while my name shall be recorded\r\non the rolls of infamy. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe secret orders fought hard to prevent the Lincoln victory in the\r\nelections of 1863. Even before that time their leaders had talked\r\nmysteriously of another disruption of the Union and the formation of\r\na Northwestern Confederacy in alliance with the South. The scheme was\r\nknown to the Confederates, allusions to it are to be found in Southern\r\nnewspapers, and even the Confederate military authorities considered it.\r\nEarly in 1863, General Beauregard thought the Confederates might \"get\r\ninto Ohio and call upon the friends of Vallandigham to rise for his\r\ndefense and support; then...call upon the whole Northwest to join in the\r\nmovement, form a confederacy of their own, and join us by a treaty\r\nof alliance, offensive and defensive.\" Reliance on the support of the\r\nsocieties was the will-o'-the-wisp that deceived General John Morgan\r\nin his desperate attempt to carry out Beauregard's programme. Though\r\nbrushed aside as a mere detail by military historians, Morgan's raid,\r\nwith his force of irregular cavalry, in July, 1863, through Indiana and\r\nOhio, was one of the most romantic episodes of the war. But it ended\r\nin his defeat and capture. While his gallant troopers rode to their\r\ndestruction, the men who loved to swear by Arcturus and to gabble about\r\nthe Pleiades showed the fiber to be expected of such people, and stayed\r\nsnug in their beds.\r\n\r\nBut neither their own lack of hardihood nor the disasters of their\r\nSouthern friends could dampen their peculiar ardor. Their hero was\r\nVallandigham. That redoubtable person had fixed his headquarters in\r\nCanada, whence he directed his partisans in their vain attempt to elect\r\nhim Governor of Ohio. Their next move was to honor him with the office\r\nof Supreme Commander of the Sons of Liberty, and now Vallandigham\r\nresolved to win the martyr's crown in very fact. In June, 1864, he\r\nprepared for the dramatic effect by carefully advertising his intention\r\nand came home. But to his great disappointment Lincoln ignored him, and\r\nthe dramatic martyrdom which he had planned did not come off.\r\n\r\nThere still existed the possibility of a great uprising, and to that\r\nend arrangements were made with Southern agents in Canada. Confederate\r\nsoldiers, picked men, made their way in disguise to Chicago. There the\r\nworshipers of Arcturus were to join them in a mighty multitude; the\r\nConfederate prisoners at Camp Douglas in Chicago were to be liberated;\r\naround that core of veterans, the hosts of the Pleiades were to\r\nrally. All this was to coincide with the assembling at Chicago of the\r\nDemocratic national convention, in which Vallandigham was to appear. The\r\norganizers of the conspiracy dreamed that the two events might coalesce;\r\nthat the convention might be stampeded by their uprising; that a\r\ngreat part, if not the whole, of the convention would endorse the\r\nestablishment of a Northwestern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nAlas for him who builds on the frame of mind that delights in cheap\r\nrhetoric while Rome is afire! At the moment of hazard, the Sons of\r\nLiberty showed the white feather, were full of specious words, would not\r\nact. The Confederate soldiers, indignant at this second betrayal, had to\r\nmake their escape from the country.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that this Democratic national convention was\r\nmade up altogether of Secessionists. The peace party was still, as\r\nin the previous year, a strange complex, a mixture of all sorts and\r\nconditions. Its cohesion was not so much due to its love of peace as to\r\nits dislike of Lincoln and its hatred of his party. Vallandigham was\r\na member of the committee on resolutions. The permanent chairman was\r\nGovernor Seymour of New York. The Convention was called to order by\r\nAugust Belmont, a foreigner by birth, the American representative of the\r\nRothschilds. He was the head and front of that body of Northern capital\r\nwhich had so long financed the South and which had always opposed the\r\nwar. In opening the Convention he said: \"Four years of misrule by a\r\nsectional, fanatical, and corrupt party have brought our country to the\r\nverge of ruin.\" In the platform Lincoln was accused of a list of crimes\r\nwhich it had become the habit of the peace party to charge against\r\nhim. His administration was described as \"four years of failure,\" and\r\nMcClellan was nominated for President.\r\n\r\nThe Republican managers called a convention at Baltimore in June, 1864,\r\nwith a view to organizing a composite Union Party in which the War\r\nDemocrats were to participate. Their plan was successful. The second\r\nplace on the Union ticket was accepted by a War Democrat, Andrew\r\nJohnson, of Tennessee. Lincoln was renominated, though not without\r\nopposition, and he was so keenly aware that he was not the unanimous\r\nchoice of the Union Party that he permitted the fact to appear in a\r\npublic utterance soon afterward. \"I do not allow myself,\" he said, in\r\naddressing a delegation of the National Union League, \"to suppose that\r\neither the Convention or the League have concluded to decide that I am\r\neither the greatest or the best man in America, but rather they have\r\nconcluded it is not best to swap horses while crossing the river, and\r\nhave further concluded that I am not so poor a horse that they might not\r\nmake a botch of it in trying to swap.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Union Party was so far from being a unit that during the summer\r\nfactional quarrels developed within its ranks. All the elements\r\nthat were unfriendly to Lincoln took heart from a dispute between the\r\nPresident and Congress with regard to reconstruction in Louisiana, over\r\na large part of which Federal troops had established a civil government\r\non the President's authority. As an incident in the history of\r\nreconstruction, this whole matter has its place in another volume.* But\r\nit also has a place in the history of the presidential campaign of\r\n1864. Lincoln's plan of reconstruction was obnoxious to the Radicals in\r\nCongress inasmuch as it did not definitely abolish slavery in Louisiana,\r\nalthough it required the new Government to give its adherence to the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation. Congress passed a bill taking reconstruction\r\nout of the President's hands and definitely requiring the reconstructed\r\nStates to abolish slavery. Lincoln took the position that Congress had\r\nno power over slavery in the States. When his Proclamation was thrown in\r\nhis teeth, he replied, \"I conceive that I may in an emergency do things\r\non military grounds which cannot be done constitutionally by Congress.\"\r\nIncidentally there was a further disagreement between the President and\r\nthe Radicals over negro suffrage. Though neither scheme provided for\r\nit, Lincoln would extend it, if at all, only to the exceptional negroes,\r\nwhile the Radicals were ready for a sweeping extension. But Lincoln\r\nrefused to sign their bill and it lapsed. Thereupon Benjamin Wade of\r\nOhio and Henry Winter Davis of Maryland issued a savage denunciation of\r\nLincoln which has been known ever since as the \"Wade-Davis Manifesto\".\r\n\r\n     * Walter L. Fleming, \"The Sequel of Appomattox\". In \"The\r\n     Chronicles of America\".\r\n\r\nThere was a faction in the Union Party which we may justly name the\r\nVindictives. The \"Manifesto\" gave them a rallying cry. At a conference\r\nin New York they decided to compel the retirement of Lincoln and the\r\nnomination of some other candidate. For this purpose a new convention\r\nwas to be called at Cincinnati in September. In the ranks of the\r\nVindictives at this time was the impetuous editor of the \"New York\r\nTribune\", Horace Greeley. His presence there calls for some explanation.\r\nPerhaps the most singular figure of the time, he was one of the most\r\nirresponsible and yet, through his paper, one of the most influential.\r\nHe had a trick of phrase which, somehow, made him appear oracular to the\r\nplain people, especially in the rural districts--the very people on whom\r\nLincoln relied for a large part of his support. Greeley knew his\r\npower, and his mind was not large enough to carry the knowledge well.\r\nFurthermore, his was the sort of nature that relates itself to life\r\nabove all through the sensibilities. Kipling speaks scornfully of people\r\nwho if their \"own front door is shut will swear the world is warm.\" They\r\nare relations in the full blood of Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\nIn July, when the breach between the President and the Vindictives was\r\njust beginning to be evident, Greeley was pursuing an adventure of his\r\nown. Among the least sensible minor incidents of the war were a number\r\nof fantastic attempts of private persons to negotiate peace. With\r\none exception they had no historic importance. The exception is a\r\nnegotiation carried on by Greeley, which seems to have been the ultimate\r\ncause of his alliance with the Vindictives.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of July, 1864, gold was selling in New York at 285.\r\nThere was distress and discontent throughout the country. The horrible\r\nslaughter of the Wilderness, still fresh in everybody's mind, had put\r\nthe whole Union Party into mourning. The impressionable Greeley became\r\nfrantic for peace peace at any price. At the psychological moment word\r\nwas conveyed to him that two persons in Canada held authority from\r\nthe Confederacy to enter into negotiations for peace. Greeley wrote to\r\nLincoln demanding negotiations because \"our bleeding, bankrupt, almost\r\ndying country longs for peace, shudders at the prospect of fresh\r\nconscriptions, of further wholesale devastations, and of new rivers of\r\nhuman blood.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln consented to a negotiation but stipulated that Greeley himself\r\nshould become responsible for its conduct. Though this was not what\r\nGreeley wanted for his type always prefers to tell others what to\r\ndo--he sullenly accepted. He proceeded to Niagara to meet the reputed\r\ncommissioners of the Confederacy. The details of the futile conference\r\ndo not concern us. The Confederate agents were not empowered to treat\r\nfor peace--at least not on any terms that would be considered at\r\nWashington. Their real purpose was far subtler. Appreciating the\r\ndelicate balance in Northern politics, they aimed at making it appear\r\nthat Lincoln was begging for terms. Lincoln, who foresaw this possible\r\nturn of events, had expressly limited Greeley to negotiations for \"the\r\nintegrity of the whole Union and the abandonment of slavery.\" Greeley\r\nchose to believe that these instructions, and not the subtlety of the\r\nConfederate agents and his own impulsiveness, were the cause of the\r\nfalse position in which the agents now placed him. They published an\r\naccount of the episode, thus effecting an exposure which led to sharp\r\nattacks upon Greeley by the Northern press. In the bitterness of his\r\nmortification Greeley then went from one extreme to the other and joined\r\nthe Vindictives.\r\n\r\nLess than three weeks after the conference at Niagara, the \"Wade-Davis\r\nManifesto\" appeared. It was communicated to the country through the\r\ncolumns of Greeley's paper on the 5th of August. Greeley, who so short\r\na time before was for peace at any price, went the whole length of\r\nreaction by proclaiming that \"Mr. Lincoln is already beaten.... We must\r\nhave another ticket to save us from utter overthrow. If we had such\r\na ticket as could be made by naming Grant, Butler, or Sherman for\r\nPresident and Farragut for Vice, we could make a fight yet.\"\r\n\r\nAt about this same time the chairman of the Republican national\r\ncommittee, who was a Lincoln man, wrote to the President that the\r\nsituation was desperate. Lincoln himself is known to have made a private\r\nmemorandum containing the words, \"It seems extremely probable that this\r\nAdministration will not be reelected.\" On the 1st of September, 1864,\r\nwith three presidential candidates in the field, Northern politics were\r\nbewildering, and the country was shrouded in the deepest gloom. The\r\nWilderness campaign, after slaughter unparalleled, had not in the\r\npopular mind achieved results. Sherman, in Georgia, though his losses\r\nwere not as terrible as Grant's, had not yet done anything to lighten\r\nthe gloom. Not even Farragut's victory in Mobile Bay, in August,\r\nfar-reaching as it proved to be, reassured the North. A bitter cry for\r\npeace went up even from lovers of the Union whose hearts had failed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the brilliant strategist in Georgia was pressing his drive\r\nfor political as well as for military effect. To rouse those Unionists\r\nwho had lost heart was part of his purpose when he hurled his columns\r\nagainst Atlanta, from which Hood was driven in one of the most\r\ndisastrous of Confederate defeats. On the 3rd of September Lincoln\r\nissued a proclamation appointing a day of thanksgiving for these great\r\nvictories of Sherman and Farragut.\r\n\r\nOn that day, it would seem, the tide turned in Northern politics. Some\r\nhistorians are content with Atlanta as the explanation of all that\r\nfollowed; but there are three separate events of importance that now\r\noccurred as incidents in the complicated situation. In the first place,\r\nthree weeks later the radical opposition had collapsed; the plan for a\r\nnew convention was abandoned; the Vindictive leaders came out in support\r\nof Lincoln. Almost simultaneously occurred the remaining two surprising\r\nevents. Fremont withdrew from his candidacy in order to do his \"part\r\ntoward preventing the election of the Democratic candidate.\" And Lincoln\r\nasked for the resignation of a member of his Cabinet, Postmaster-General\r\nMontgomery Blair, who was the especial enemy of the Vindictives.\r\n\r\nThe official biographers of Lincoln* keep these three events separate.\r\nThey hold that Blair's removal was wholly Lincoln's idea, and that from\r\nchivalrous reasons he would not abandon his friend as long as he seemed\r\nto be losing the game. The historian Rhodes writes confidently of a\r\nbargain with Fremont, holding that Blair was removed to terminate a\r\nquarrel with Fremont which dated back even to his own removal in 1861.\r\nA possible third theory turns upon Chase, whose hostility to Blair was\r\nquite equal to that of the illbalanced Fremont. It had been stimulated\r\nthe previous winter by a fierce arraignment of Chase made by Blair's\r\nbrother in Congress, in which Chase was bluntly accused of fraud and\r\nof making money, or allowing his friends to make money, through illicit\r\ntrade in cotton. And Chase was a man of might among the Vindictives. The\r\nintrigue, however, never comes to the foreground in history, but lurks\r\nin the background thick with shadows. Once or twice among those\r\nshadows we seem to catch a glimpse of the figure of Thurlow Weed, the\r\nmaster-politician of the time. Taking one thing with another, we may\r\nrisk the guess that somehow the two radical groups which were both\r\nrelentless against Blair were led to pool their issues, and that Blair's\r\nremoval was the price Lincoln paid not to one faction of radicals but to\r\nthe whole unmerciful crowd.\r\n\r\n     *His private secretaries, John G. Nicolay and John Hay.\r\n\r\nWhatever complex of purposes lay back of the triple coincidence, the\r\nlatter part of September saw a general reunion of the factions within\r\nthe Union Party, followed by a swift recovery of strength. When the\r\nelection came, Lincoln received an electoral vote of 212 against 21, and\r\na popular vote of 2,330,552 against 1,835,985.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable question arises as to what was the real cause of this\r\nsuccess. It is safe to say that the political campaign contained some\r\nadroit strategy; that Sherman was without doubt an enormous factor; that\r\nthe Democrats made numerous blunders; and that the secret societies had\r\nan effect other than they intended. However, the real clue seems to be\r\nfound in one sentence from a letter written by Lowell to Motley when the\r\noutlook for his party was darkest: \"The mercantile classes are longing\r\nfor peace, but I believe that the people are more firm than ever.\" Of\r\nthe great, silent mass of the people, the true temper seems to be struck\r\noff in a popular poem of the time, written in response to one of the\r\ncalls for more troops, a poem with refrains built on the model of this\r\ncouplet:\r\n\r\n\"We're coming from the hillside, we're coming from the shore, We're\r\ncoming, Father Abraham, six hundred thousand more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. LINCOLN'S FINAL INTENTIONS\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Union Party in November enabled Lincoln to enjoy for\r\na brief period of his career as President what may be thought of as a\r\nlull in the storm. He knew now that he had at last built up a firm\r\nand powerful support. With this assured, his policy, both domestic and\r\nforeign--the key to which was still the blockade--might be considered\r\nvictorious at all points. There remains to be noticed, however, one\r\nevent of the year 1864 which was of vital importance in maintaining the\r\nblockade.\r\n\r\nIt is a principle of international law that a belligerent must itself\r\nattend to the great task of suppressing contraband trade with its enemy.\r\nLincoln was careful to observe this principle. Though British merchants\r\nwere frankly speculating in contraband trade, he made no demand upon\r\nthe British Government to relieve him of the difficulty of stopping it.\r\nEngland also took the legitimate position under international law\r\nand warned her merchants that, while it was none of the Government's\r\nbusiness to prevent such trade, they practised it at their own risk,\r\nsubject to well-understood penalties agreed upon among nations. The\r\nmerchants nevertheless continued to take the risk, while both they and\r\nthe authorities of the Confederacy thought they saw a way of minimizing\r\nthe danger. Instead of shipping supplies direct to the Confederate ports\r\nthey shipped them to Matamoros, in Mexico, or to the West Indies. As\r\nthese ports were in neutral territory, the merchants thought their goods\r\nwould be safe against capture until they left the Mexican or West\r\nIndian port on their brief concluding passage to the territory of the\r\nConfederacy. Nassau, then a petty West India town, was the chief depot\r\nof such trade and soon became a great commercial center. To it came vast\r\nquantities of European goods which were then transferred to swift, small\r\nvessels, or \"blockade-runners,\" which took a gambler's chance and often\r\nsucceeded in eluding the Federal patrol ships and in rushing their\r\ncargoes safe into a Confederate port.\r\n\r\nObviously, it was a great disadvantage to the United States to allow\r\ncontraband supplies to be accumulated, without interference, close to\r\nthe blockaded coast, and the Lincoln Government determined to remove\r\nthis disadvantage. With this end in view it evoked the principle of the\r\ncontinuous voyage, which indeed was not new, but which was destined to\r\nbecome fixed in international law by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates. American cruisers were instructed to stop British ships sailing\r\nbetween the British ports of Liverpool and Nassau; they were to use the\r\nrecognized international rights of visit and search; and if there was\r\nevidence that the cargo was not destined for actual consumption at\r\nNassau, they were to bring the ship into an American port to be dealt\r\nwith by an American prize court. When such arrests began, the owners\r\nclamored to the British Government, and both dealers in contraband and\r\nprofessional blockade-runners worked themselves into a fury because\r\nAmerican cruisers watched British ports and searched British ships on\r\nthe high seas. With regard to this matter, the British Government and\r\nthe Government at Washington had their last important correspondence\r\nduring the war. The United States stood firm for the idea that when\r\ngoods were ultimately intended for the Confederacy, no matter how\r\nroundabout the journey, they could be considered as making a single\r\ncontinuous voyage and were liable to capture from the day they left\r\nLiverpool. Early in 1865, the Supreme Court of the United States fully\r\ndeveloped the principle of continuous voyage in four celebrated cases\r\nthat are now among the landmarks of international law.*\r\n\r\n     * The Great war has once again led to controversy over this\r\n     subject, so vital to neutral states.\r\n\r\nThis was the last step in making the blockade effective. Thereafter, it\r\nslowly strangled the South. The Federal armies enormously overmatched\r\nthe Southern, and from November, 1864, their continuance in the field\r\nwas made sure. Grim work still lay before Lincoln, but the day of\r\nanxiety was past. In this moment of comparative ease, the aged Chief\r\nJustice Taney died, and Lincoln appointed to that high position his\r\nungenerous rival, Chase.\r\n\r\nEven now Lincoln had not established himself as a leader superior to\r\nparty, but he had the satisfaction, early in 1865, of seeing the ranks\r\nof the opposition begin to break. Naturally, the Thirteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution, abolishing slavery throughout the United States,\r\nappeared to Lincoln as in a way the consummation of his labors. When\r\nthe House voted on the resolution to send this amendment to the States,\r\nseveral Democrats joined the government forces. Two nights afterward,\r\nspeaking to a serenading party at the White House, Lincoln made a brief\r\nspeech, part of which is thus reported by his secretaries: \"He thought\r\nthis measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct to the\r\nwinding up of the great difficulty. He wished the reunion of all the\r\nStates perfected, and so effected as to remove all causes of disturbance\r\nin the future; and to attain this end, it was necessary that the\r\noriginal disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out.\"\r\n\r\nAn event which in its full detail belongs to Confederate rather than to\r\nUnion history took place soon after this. At Hampton Roads, Lincoln and\r\nSeward met Confederate commissioners who had asked for a parley--with\r\nregard to peace. Nothing came of the meeting, but the conference gave\r\nrise to a legend, false in fact and yet true in spirit, according to\r\nwhich Lincoln wrote on a sheet of paper the word \"Union,\" pushed it\r\nacross to Alexander H. Stephens and said, \"Write under that anything you\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nThis fiction expresses Lincoln's attitude toward the sinking\r\nConfederacy. On his return from Hampton Roads he submitted to his\r\nCabinet a draft of a message which he proposed to send to Congress. He\r\nrecommended the appropriation of $400,000,000 to be distributed among\r\nthe slave states on condition that war cease before April 1, 1865. Not a\r\nmember of the Cabinet approved. His secretary, Mr. Nicolay, writes: \"The\r\nPresident, in evident surprise and sorrow at the want of statesmanlike\r\nliberality shown by his executive council, folded and laid away the\r\ndraft of his message....\" With a deep sigh he added, \"But you are all\r\nopposed to me, and I will not send the message.\"\r\n\r\nHis second inauguration passed without striking incidents. Chase, as\r\nChief Justice, administered the oath. The second inaugural address\r\ncontained words which are now famous: \"With malice towards none; with\r\ncharity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the\r\nright, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the\r\nnation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and\r\nfor his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a\r\njust and a lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\"\r\n\r\nThat gigantic system of fleets and armies, the creation of which was due\r\nto Lincoln, was closing tight around the dying Confederacy. Five weeks\r\nafter the inauguration Lee surrendered, and the war was virtually at an\r\nend. What was to come after was inevitably the overshadowing topic of\r\nthe hour. Many anecdotes represent Lincoln, in these last few days\r\nof his life, as possessed by a high though melancholy mood of extreme\r\nmercy. Therefore, much has been inferred from the following words, in\r\nhis last public address, made on the night of the 11th of April: \"In the\r\npresent situation, as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some\r\nnew announcement to the people of the South. I am considering and shall\r\nnot fail to act when action shall be proper.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done for the South, what treatment should be accorded the\r\nSouthern leaders, engrossed the President and his Cabinet at the meeting\r\non the 14th of April, which was destined to be their last. Secretary\r\nWelles has preserved the spirit of the meeting in a striking anecdote.\r\nLincoln said that no one need expect he would \"take any part in hanging\r\nor killing those men, even the worst of them. Frighten them out of the\r\ncountry, open the gates, let down the bars, scare them off;\" said he,\r\nthrowing up his hands as if scaring sheep. \"Enough lives have been\r\nsacrificed; we must extinguish our resentments if we expect harmony and\r\nunion.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Lincoln was thus arming himself with a valiant mercy, a band of\r\nconspirators at an obscure boardinghouse in Washington were planning his\r\nassassination. Their leader was John Wilkes Booth, an actor, brother of\r\nthe much abler Edwin Booth. There seems little doubt that he was insane.\r\nAround him gathered a small group of visionary extremists in whom much\r\nbrooding upon Southern wrongs had produced an unbalanced condition. Only\r\na morbid interest can attach today to the strange cunning with\r\nwhich Booth laid his plans, thinking of himself all the while as a\r\nreincarnation of the Roman Brutus.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 14th of April, the President attended a performance\r\nof \"Our American Cousin\". While the play was in progress, Booth stole\r\ninto the President's box, came close behind him, and shot him through\r\nthe head. Lincoln never spoke again and, shortly after seven next\r\nmorning, ceased breathing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a futile attempt was made upon the life of Seward.\r\nBooth temporarily escaped. Later he was overtaken and shot. His\r\naccomplices were hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage of sixty years has proved fully necessary to the placing of\r\nLincoln in historic perspective. No President, in his own time, with the\r\npossible exception of Washington, was so bitterly hated and so fiercely\r\nreviled. On the other hand, none has been the object of such intemperate\r\nhero-worship. However, the greatest of the land were, in the main, quick\r\nto see him in perspective and to recognize his historic significance. It\r\nis recorded of Davis that in after days he paid a beautiful tribute to\r\nLincoln and said, \"Next to the destruction of the Confederacy, the death\r\nof Abraham Lincoln was the darkest day the South has known.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\nThere are two general histories, of conspicuous ability, that deal with\r\nthis period:\r\n\r\nJ. F. Rhodes, \"History of the United States from the Compromise of\r\n1850\", 7 vols. (1893-1906), and J. B. McMaster, \"History of the People\r\nof the United States\", 7 vols. (1883-1912). McMaster has the more\r\n\"modern\" point of view and is excellent but dry, without any sense of\r\nnarrative. Rhodes has a somewhat older point of view. For example, he\r\nmakes only a casual reference, in a quotation, to the munitions\r\nproblem of 1861, though analyzing with great force and candor such\r\nconstitutional issues as the arrests under the suspension of the writ\r\nof habeas corpus. The other strong points in his work are its sense\r\nof narrative, its freedom from hero-worship, its independence of\r\nconventional views of Northern leaders. As to the South, it suffers from\r\na certain Narrowness of vision due to the comparative scantiness of the\r\nmaterial used. The same may be said of McMaster.\r\n\r\nFor Lincoln, there is no adequate brief biography. Perhaps the best is\r\nthe most recent, \"Abraham Lincoln\", by Lord Charnwood (\"Makers of the\r\nNineteenth Century\", 1917). It has a kind of cool detachment that hardly\r\nany biographer had shown previously, and yet this coolness is joined\r\nwith extreme admiration. Short biographies worth considering are John\r\nT. Morse, Jr., \"Abraham Lincoln\" (\"American Statesmen\" Series, 2 vols.,\r\n1893), and Ida M. Tarbell, \"Life of Abraham Lincoln\", 2 vols. (1900).\r\nThe official biography is in ten volumes, \"Abraham Lincoln, a History\",\r\nby his secretaries, John G. Nicolay and John Hay (1890). It is a\r\npriceless document and as such is little likely to be forgotten. But its\r\nevents are so numerous that they swamp the figure of Lincoln and yet are\r\nnot numerous enough to constitute a definitive history of the times. It\r\nis wholly eulogistic. The same authors edited \"The Writings of Abraham\r\nLincoln\" (Biographical Edition, 2 vols., 1894), which has since been\r\nexpanded (1905) and now fills twelve volumes. It is the definitive\r\npresentation of Lincoln's mind. A book much sought after by his enemies\r\nis William Henry Herndon and Jesse William Weik, \"The History and\r\nPersonal Recollections of Abraham Lincoln\", 8 vols. (1889; unexpurgated\r\nedition). It contains about all we know of his early life and paints a\r\npicture of sordid ugliness. Its reliability has been disputed. No study\r\nof Lincoln is complete unless one has marched through the \"Diary\" of\r\nGideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, 3 vols. (1911), which is our most\r\nimportant document showing Lincoln in his Cabinet. Important sidelights\r\non his character and development are shown in Ward Hill Lamon,\r\n\"Recollections of Lincoln\" (1911); David Homer Bates, \"Lincoln in the\r\nTelegraph Office\" (1907); and Frederick Trevor Hill, \"Lincoln as a\r\nLawyer\" (1906). A bibliography of Lincoln is in the twelfth volume of\r\nthe latest edition of the \"Writings\".\r\n\r\nThe lesser statesmen of the time, both Northern and Southern, still, as\r\na rule, await proper treatment by detached biographers. Two Northerners\r\nhave had such treatment, in Allen Johnson's \"Stephen A. Douglas\" (1908),\r\nand Frederic Bancroft's \"Life of William H. Seward\", 2 vols. (1900).\r\nGood, but without the requisite detachment, is Moorfield Storey's\r\n\"Charles Sumner\", (\"American Statesmen Series\", 1900). With similar\r\nexcellences but with the same defect, though still the best in its\r\nfield, is Albert Bushnell Hart's \"Salmon P. Chase\" (\"American Statesmen\r\nSeries\", 1899). Among the Southern statesmen involved in the events of\r\nthis volume, only the President of the Confederacy has received adequate\r\nreconsideration in recent years, in William E. Dodd's \"Jefferson Davis\"\r\n(1907). The latest life of \"Robert Toombs\", by Ulrich B. Phillips\r\n(1914), is not definitive, but the best extant. The great need for\r\nadequate lives of Stephens and Yancey is not at all met by the obsolete\r\nworks--R. M. Johnston and W. M. Browne, \"Life of Alexander H. Stephens\"\r\n(1878), and J. W. Du Bose, \"The Life and Times of William Lowndes\r\nYancey\" (1892). There is a brief biography of Stephens by Louis\r\nPendleton, in the \"American Crisis Biographies\". Most of the remaining\r\nbiographies of the period, whether Northern or Southern, are either too\r\nsuperficial or too partisan to be recommended for general use. Almost\r\nalone in their way are the delightful \"Confederate Portraits\", by\r\nGamaliel Bradford (1914), and the same author's \"Union Portraits\"\r\n(1916).\r\n\r\nUpon conditions in the North during the war there is a vast amount of\r\nmaterial; but little is accessible to the general reader. A book of\r\ngreat value is Emerson Fite's Social and Industrial Conditions in\r\nthe North during the Civil War (1910). Out of unnumbered books of\r\nreminiscence, one stands forth for the sincerity of its disinterested,\r\nif sharp, observation--W. H. Russell's \"My Diary North and South\"\r\n(1868). Two newspapers are invaluable: The \"New York Tribune\" for a\r\nversion of events as seen by the war party, \"The New York Herald\" for\r\nthe opposite point of view; the Chicago papers are also important,\r\nchiefly the \"Times\" and \"Tribune\"; the \"Republican \"of Springfield,\r\nMass., had begun its distinguished career, while the \"Journal\" and\r\n\"Advertiser\" of Boston revealed Eastern New England. For the Southern\r\npoint of view, no papers are more important than the Richmond\r\n\"Examiner\", the Charleston \"Mercury\", and the New Orleans \"Picayune\".\r\nFinancial and economic problems are well summed up in D. R. Dewey's\r\n\"Financial History of the United States\" (3d edition, 1907), and in\r\nE. P. Oberholzer's \"Jay Cooks\", 2 vols. (1907). Foreign affairs\r\nare summarized adequately in C. F. Adams's \"Charles Francis Adams\"\r\n(\"American Statesmen Series\", 1900), John Bigelow's \"France and the\r\nConfederate Navy\" (1888), A. P. Martin's \"Maximilian in Mexico\" (1914),\r\nand John Bassett Moore's \"Digest of International Law\", 8 vols. (1906).\r\n\r\nThe documents of the period ranging from newspapers to presidential\r\nmessages are not likely to be considered by the general reader, but if\r\ngiven a fair chance will prove fascinating. Besides the biographical\r\nedition of Lincoln's Writings, should be named, first of all, \"The\r\nCongressional Globe\" for debates in Congress; the \"Statutes at Large\";\r\nthe \"Executive Documents\", published by the Government and containing a\r\ngreat number of reports; and the enormous collection issued by the\r\nWar Department under the title \"Official Records of the Union and\r\nConfederate Armies\", 128 vols. (1880-1901), especially the groups of\r\nvolumes known as second and third series.",
