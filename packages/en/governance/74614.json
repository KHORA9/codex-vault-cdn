He was further enabled to go\r\nover the red-books of the empire, which enter into the details of the\r\npedigrees of illustrious families, and into the minutiæ of Government\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe supposed unalterable character of these institutions induces those\r\nwho have any pretensions to learning in China and Japan to master and\r\nretain by memory the names and duties of the different offices in the\r\nvarious departments of Government; and they are frequently found to\r\nbe good authorities upon questions upon which there is no published\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the intercourse of the Jesuits with Japan, the\r\nletters of the fathers have been almost the only authorities relied\r\nupon; while in the more recent events contemporary publications have\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\nIn taking notes from the conversation of a Japanese who could speak but\r\nlittle English, in too many cases they were written down in what is\r\nknown in China as “pigeon English”; and the Author has to acknowledge\r\nand regret that in many cases the cramped nature of the notes has not\r\nbeen entirely removed, and for such instances he craves the indulgence\r\nof the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL FAMILY AND COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nMan, in the earlier periods of his existence, when he was as yet\r\nputting forth his juvenile strength to subdue creation, was ever\r\ninclined to look upon the great forces of nature as difficulties in\r\nhis path and obstacles to his progress, which, in his more mature\r\nstrength, he has come to regard as aids to help him, and to cherish as\r\nthe very means to the attainment of his ends. Such an object of awe\r\nto the earlier mariner was the great ocean, when he had no compass to\r\nguide him over its unknown and apparently boundless expanse, and with\r\nno knowledge of the winds and no experience of the currents. When he\r\nhad no means of keeping food or fresh water for any great length of\r\ntime, he was a bold man who would venture far out of sight of land.\r\nProvided with the faithful compass, men became bolder; they enlarged\r\ntheir vessels, making longer voyages, until they ran over the length\r\nand breadth of the Eastern seas. Still the China Sea, with its typhoons\r\nand its monsoons and currents, down to a comparatively recent period,\r\nwas looked upon as an obstacle which was to be smoothed down and not\r\nto be wrestled with. To beat up the China Sea against the northeastern\r\nmonsoon was considered a rash struggle and a fool hardy waste of time,\r\nand in consequence the trade-voyages to China were confined to vessels\r\ngoing up the sea in summer with the southerly monsoon and returning\r\nin winter with the northerly. Obstacles such as these made mariners\r\nunwilling to run the risk of pushing up the sea the length of Shanghai\r\nor Japan, when the time of their return was a matter of so much doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the present age, when man is thinking himself of some importance\r\nfrom the little odds and ends of knowledge he has stored up, the\r\nocean, instead of being a barrier of separation between islands and\r\ncontinents, has become what the Mediterranean Sea was to the Old\r\nWorld--a link of connection, a highway of commerce, and steam has\r\nbecome a bridge by which distant shores have been joined together. The\r\nworld is now finding out that she is one--that the interests of nations\r\nare one, and that no one part of the body can say to the other, “I have\r\nno need of thee.” If Japan has hitherto felt herself in a position to\r\nuse such an expression to her fellow-members of the body cosmopolitan,\r\nand the feeling has been responded to by their acquiescence, the time\r\nand circumstances seem to have arrived when this seclusion is to be\r\nended. The distance at which these islands seemed to lie from the heart\r\nof the world’s circulation, Europe, has been almost annihilated, and\r\nEuropean nations have through the settlements in India and China crept\r\nup alongside of the isles of the East. The difficulties of access have\r\nbeen smoothed away, her sumptuary laws have been abrogated, while\r\nthe produce of her rich soil is daily increasing to meet the demands\r\nwhich are made upon it, and which she is becoming willing and ready to\r\nexchange for that of which she is more in need.\r\n\r\nSteam has been the active agent in bringing about these changes,\r\ncausing the pulses of trade to beat with greater frequency and with\r\nincreased vigor. But to any one who looks below the surface there may\r\nbe seen other agents at work, all concurring at this crisis in the\r\nworld’s existence to produce changes of portentous magnitude. The\r\ndiscoveries of chemistry, whether by the aggressive forces obtained in\r\nthe manufacture of munitions of war, or by the more widely extended\r\nbut silent beneficial operations of such an agent as quinine, steam\r\nwith all its ramifications of wealth, the telegraph with its tenfold\r\npower of convertibility, the discovery of gold at the most remote\r\nparts of the world, have combined to produce, by the sudden influx of\r\nreal wealth, by the intermingling of ranks of men, and by the rapid\r\nthrowing into men’s minds of a quantity of information or of knowledge,\r\na condition of things in the mass which makes that mass kneadable by\r\nthose who can knead it, and fitted for the reception of any leaven, for\r\ngood or for evil, which may be mixed with it. The mingling of ranks\r\nin the social system, the disturbance of creeds in the religious, the\r\nconfounding of parties in the political, are preparing the way for some\r\nworld-wide change, by which old systems are to be done away and new\r\nestablished. It is not working in one nation alone, but in all: it is\r\nnot confined to Christendom, showing that the time to come is not to\r\nbe like times past; but that the time is coming when it is possible\r\nfor one person to aim at one rule over the whole world. This change\r\nis coming up like the rising of water. It may overwhelm all existing\r\nthings like a wave. Some call it Progress, others Democracy, but,\r\nwhatever it be, it is evident that every existing institution is to get\r\nsuch a shaking that only the things that cannot be shaken will stand.\r\n\r\nAll national institutions having, or pretending to have, order, will\r\nprobably have to undergo this trial; and when it comes the whole\r\nremains of the feudal system will be tested: monarchies, the peerage,\r\ntenures of land, orders in the Church, and, above all, the question\r\nof primogeniture, cannot fail to be put on trial. The different\r\nsections in the religious and political world seem gradually separating\r\nthemselves into two large parties, the one standing for the _vox\r\nDei_, the other holding the _vox populi_ to be the _vox Dei_--the one\r\nbelieving that power comes from above, the other that power comes from\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe leaven is working in the minds of men, whether they will it or not;\r\nand no nation will feel the effects of this fermentation more than\r\nJapan. Above all nations, she to this hour retains her feudal system\r\nintact. She must learn, as others have in past times and may have to\r\nlearn again, at the expense of revolution and blood. The people are\r\nalready being stirred, and dare to question. The nobles are beginning\r\nto quake, they know not why, in the face of changes which are being\r\nforced upon them. The very throne of the emperor is being searched and\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand where the weakness of a building lies, or how\r\nit is likely to fall down, it is first necessary to know how it is\r\nconstructed; and in order to comprehend the changes which events may\r\nbring about in Japan, some idea must be formed of the government of the\r\ncountry. Without some knowledge of the framework of the constitution,\r\nit is difficult to understand the relative position of men, or to\r\nappreciate the operation of external agents upon the system of the\r\nempire, whether that operation work by a slow process of leavening from\r\nwithin, or by a violent concussion from without.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the author in the following pages has been to give some idea\r\nof the framework of the constitution of Japan. Having resided for some\r\nlittle time in the country, he was enabled to get what seemed to him a\r\nclearer glimpse of the working of the different parts of the machinery\r\nof State than was to be gained from any of the able works published on\r\nthe subject. The time at his command was too short, and his knowledge\r\nof the language too limited, to enable him to do more than prepare a\r\nsketch which may serve a temporary purpose, before works of greater\r\nresearch and fuller information are produced.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Emperor (Spiritual Emperor, as he is sometimes\r\nerroneously called), as the first in the empire, must be recognized;\r\nthe office held by the Temporal Emperor, the Shiogoon (or Tycoon, as\r\nhe has been named), must be correctly and distinctly understood before\r\nthe nature of the rule in the empire can be comprehended. It is further\r\nessential that the student should be acquainted with the rank and\r\nposition of the nobility or nobilities of the empire (for of these\r\nthere are two classes)--that of Miako at the court of the Emperor, the\r\nKoongays; and that of Yedo at the court of the Shiogoon, the Daimio,\r\nand beneath them the Hattamoto. Without some knowledge of these the\r\nreader is lost in a maze of unmeaning names and titles; but with a\r\nslight acquaintance with the rank, offices, and names of these nobles,\r\nhe is able not only to follow the thread of history, but to understand\r\nthe intricacies of current events.\r\n\r\nA description of a picture by a native artist, seen by the author\r\nof this volume, may give some idea of the relation in which these\r\ndignitaries stand the one to the other. The upper half of the picture\r\nrepresents the Shiogoon or Tycoon at the palace in the capital, Miako,\r\nmaking his obeisance and performing homage before his liege lord the\r\nEmperor, seated in the great hall, Shi shin den, of the palace. The\r\nupper part of the Emperor’s person is concealed behind a screen of thin\r\nslips of bamboo hanging from the roof. The throne is three mats, or\r\nthin mattresses, placed one above the other upon the floor. There is no\r\nchair or support to the back. On each side of the Emperor sit on their\r\nknees on the floor the high officers of his court. Before him is seen\r\nthe late Shiogoon, kneeling and prostrating himself, with his head to\r\nthe floor. Behind the Shiogoon are his high officers Stotsbashi and the\r\ngreat Daimio Owarri, both in a similar position of prostration; while\r\nbeneath, in the open court, are military officials of the Imperial\r\nCourt standing or kneeling. This picture represents accurately a fact,\r\nand what appears to be a correct illustration of the ideas of the\r\npeople of Japan with regard to the relative status of the Emperor and\r\nthe Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nIt may almost be a matter of wonder that so little was known of Japan\r\nuntil the advent of the Portuguese. Men were in old times adventurous\r\ntravelers, and yet, except what is contained in the pages of Marco\r\nPolo, written in the thirteenth century, nothing more was known of the\r\nexistence of the country. The Buddhism of India had permeated China,\r\nCorea, and Japan, but it brought nothing back. Mohammedanism, at an\r\nearly stage, reached China, and gained many converts, and the Arabs\r\ncarried on an extensive trade with China and the Eastern Isles; but\r\nneither by their writings nor by the early native accounts do they\r\nseem to have reached the shores of Japan, or, at least, ever to have\r\nreturned from them. This may perhaps be attributed to the wars of\r\nthe Crusades, which appear to have lighted up such a fierce feeling\r\nbetween the Christian and the Moslem as to have proved a barrier to\r\nthe inquisitiveness of the former in his investigations regarding the\r\nEast. When the Portuguese, in the beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\nhad pushed their discoveries and trade as far as Malacca, and thence to\r\nChina, it was to be expected that such adventurous seamen as they then\r\nwere would, before long, solve the question of a people living under\r\nthe rising sun. It is fortunate that, among the lawless buccaneers\r\nand pirates, as they evidently were, on those seas during this time,\r\none man, Mendez Pinto, should have been found with the zeal to write\r\nsome account of the doings on the Sea of China, and to lift the veil\r\nwhich, until he wrote, hung over the events which he records. That\r\nthe latter part of his narrative, relating principally to China,\r\nshould have been called mendacious, is not to be wondered at. But all\r\nthat he relates with reference to Japan is not only corroborated by\r\na closer acquaintance with the country and people, but also by the\r\nnative historians in their accounts of the arrival of foreigners in the\r\ncountry, as well as by the letters of the Jesuits who visited Japan\r\nvery shortly after it was first discovered by the Portuguese traders.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the period at which Mendez Pinto wrote, the history\r\nof foreign relations with the country is kept up by the letters of\r\npriests and Jesuits who occupied Japan as a field for the spread\r\nof Christianity. In the “Histoire de l’Église du Japon” there is\r\nan excellent summary of occurrences connected with the Church, its\r\nmissions, its successes, its difficulties, its martyrs, and its\r\nenemies, together with a glance at events in Japan during the most\r\neventful crisis in the history of the country. After the expulsion of\r\nthe Jesuits and Roman Catholic doctrines from the empire, there are\r\naccounts from time to time published by the officers connected with\r\nthe establishment kept up by Holland at Nagasaki. Caron, Fischer,\r\nMeylan--but, above all, Kæmpfer and Thunberg, and Titsingh and\r\nKlaproth--and, in our own times, Siebold--have done much to elucidate\r\nthe manners and customs and natural history of Japan.\r\n\r\nKæmpfer has given a most interesting and instructive account of what\r\nhe saw in the country during a long residence, and upon more than\r\none progress to the courts at Miako and Yedo. His delineation of the\r\nmanners and customs of the people of Japan will remain as a memorial of\r\na state of things seen under circumstances not likely to occur again.\r\nBut the work was published by another after the death of the author,\r\nand, in consequence of this, many of the names of men, places and\r\nthings are nearly unintelligible. Kæmpfer’s work is well known to the\r\nJapanese, having been translated or repeatedly copied in manuscript,\r\nand is known as “Su koku rong.” It is an interdicted book, and only\r\nrecently a man was punished upon being detected in the act of copying\r\nthe translation. The translation by Klaproth of the “Annales des\r\nEmpereurs de Japon” is a most valuable work, and contains a wonderful\r\namount of information, being, as it were, the complement of Kæmpfer’s\r\nwork, drawn entirely from books and not from personal observation.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Japan appear to have an intense love and reverence for\r\ntheir own country, and every individual in the empire seems to have a\r\ndeep and thorough appreciation of the natural beauties and delights\r\nof the country. To this the genial climate, the rich soil, and the\r\nvariety of the surface contribute. The islands lie at such a latitude\r\nas to make the air in summer warm without being hot, and in winter cold\r\nwithout being raw. The soil, as in all recent lava soils, is of a rich\r\nblack mould, raising the finest crops of millet, wheat and sugar-cane,\r\nand when supplied in unstinted profusion rearing splendid timber, or\r\ncapable, when nearly entirely withdrawn, of keeping life and vigor\r\nand seeding power in a pine tree of two inches in height. The trees\r\nhave a tendency to break out into excrescences from plethora. The\r\nvariety of surface arises from the great height to which the mountains\r\nrise in an island which at no part presents so great a breadth as\r\nEngland, and yet slopes gradually from the mountain tops to the sea.\r\nSome of these ridges appear to rise to the height of Mont Blanc, one\r\nof them, Fusiyama, being upward of thirteen thousand feet in height,\r\nand it would appear that other ranges are higher. The great beauty of\r\nFusi (_pah rh_, not two) consists in its rising singly out of a low\r\ncountry with a beautifully curved sweep to a conical apex; and the\r\natmospheric effects changing from hour to hour, as it is seen from\r\nthirteen provinces, give such a variety to this single object that it\r\nis rightly called by a name to express the feeling that there are not\r\ntwo such in the world. The variations of atmospheric density make it\r\nlook at one time much higher than at another. It may be seen with its\r\nhead clear in the blue sky rising out of a thick base of clouds--or the\r\nclouds rise and roll in masses about the middle, leaving the gentle\r\ncurve to be filled up by the mind’s eye from the base to the apex.\r\nAgain, the whole contour, in a sort of proud, queenly sweep, stands out\r\nagainst a cloudless ether, or with a little vapor drifting to leeward\r\nof the summit giving the appearance of a crater--or, after a cool night\r\nin September, the eye is arrested by the appearance of the bursting\r\ndownward of a flattened shell, the pure white snow filling the valleys\r\nfrom the top, the haze of the morning half concealing the hill beneath.\r\nEvery hour brings a change upon a landscape which consists of a single\r\nobject which the lover of nature can never weary of admiring, in a\r\nclimate where seventy miles of atmosphere does not obscure the larger\r\nfeatures on the face of the mountain even to the naked eye. How often\r\nwould such an object be visible in the climate of England?\r\n\r\nThe first settlement of inhabitants upon an island is always a\r\nsubject of interesting speculation and inquiry. The insular position\r\ngives an idea of a definite time or period at which the peopling of\r\na large island must have taken place. The freedom of possession of\r\nboundless wealth presents every inducement to the immigrant to remain,\r\nwhile distance and difficulties repel the idea of return. In Japan\r\nthis immigration may in all probability have commenced by a gradual\r\nspreading from the north of inhabitants of Manchuria through the\r\nislands of Saghalien and Jezo to those of the Japanese group.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier periods of a nation’s existence, the art of writing\r\nhas been generally kept in the hands of men who have devoted themselves\r\nto a life of retirement and seclusion from the strife and temptations\r\nof the outer world. These have been found among the priesthood, and\r\nit has been their business or their amusement to gather up and commit\r\nto writing what had been up to the time current as oral tradition in\r\nregard to prehistoric occurrences. Men are forced by reasoning to refer\r\nthe appearance of their first ancestors to a creation by, or procession\r\nfrom, a Divine Being. At the same time, those who have wielded the\r\npower of writing, and thereby reached and influenced a larger circle of\r\ntheir fellowmen, have generally endeavored to clothe the deities from\r\nwhom they profess to have sprung with virtues which were to be emulated\r\nby their descendants, or to inculcate through them, by precept, a\r\npurity of moral conduct to be practiced by their followers.\r\n\r\nThe group of islands generally included under the one name Japan was\r\nknown in remote times by a variety of names--“Akitsu sima, Toyo aki,\r\nToyo ashiwarra no nakatsa kooni.” “Wo kwo,” the country of peace, is\r\nused by the Chinese for Japan. “Ho,” pronounced “Yamato,” and used for\r\none province, is frequently applied in Japan to the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe name Nippon--Nits pon--“Yutpone” in Cantonese, “Jih pun” in the\r\nMandarin dialect, by which the whole empire is now known--is of\r\nChinese origin, and has probably been conveyed to the country by the\r\nfirst Chinese settlers. Denoting, as the name implies, that it is\r\nthe country where the sun rises, the idea must have originated with\r\nthe people to the west. “Hon cho,” another name by which it is known,\r\nconveys the same idea, “The beginning or root of the morning.” The name\r\n“Yamato,” peaceful, harmonious, was more likely to have originated\r\nwith the natives. “Akitsu sima” implies that the island resembles a\r\ndragonfly in shape, and was at first applied to Kiusiu alone. “Shin\r\nkoku,” a name by which the Japanese speak of their own empire, means\r\nthe land of spirits; and a similar idea is conveyed by the name “Kami\r\nno kooni.” “Awadsi sima” refers to the supposed origin of the islands\r\nfrom mud or froth, and is still applied to the large island lying\r\nbetween Nippon and Sikok.\r\n\r\nSome of these names probably retain the old words used by the original\r\ninhabitants of the country translated into Chinese by the new\r\nimmigrants. To these newcomers it was no doubt a work of pleasure to\r\ngather up what stores of tradition were floating among the inhabitants\r\nof the country, and, adding thereto much from their own imagination, to\r\ncompose a mythology suited to the genius of the people. This mythology,\r\nwhich we may suppose to have been composed by some of the Chinese\r\n_literati_ about the court, had for its object the elevation of the\r\nreigning family, and the assertion for that family of a divine origin\r\nand divine ancestry. It is worthy of note that these divine ancestors\r\nwere known at a very early period by Chinese names, that of the mother\r\nand founder of the imperial family being “Ten sho dai jin”--the “great\r\nspirit of the celestial splendor of the sun,” four distinct Chinese\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAccording to this mythology, the heavens and the earth having formed\r\nthemselves out of nothing, gave forth a spirit--a “kami”--who was the\r\nfather of a line of seven generations of spiritual beings who ruled\r\nthe universe as it then was, during a period extending over millions\r\nof years, ending in a male and a female, respectively named Issanaghi\r\nand Issanami. These seem equivalents to or representatives of the male\r\nand the female principles which, according to the Chinese, pervade\r\nall animate creation. They are allegorically represented as producing\r\nthe islands of Japan, the mountains, seas and other natural objects\r\ntherein. Subsequently a daughter was brought forth, “Ten sho dai jin,”\r\nwho is the spirit of the sun; and another, “Tsuki no kami,” the spirit\r\nof the moon. These divinities are of no further importance in history\r\nthan as serving to make a line of ancestry for the reigning family. At\r\nthe time when, according to tradition, the genealogy merged in mortal\r\nmen, the country was found to be peopled, and there is no attempt to\r\nshow whence these people came, though described as hairy, uncivilized,\r\nand living in the open air. These myths are generally of a Buddhistic\r\norigin, and were probably brought over or invented by some missionary\r\nof that religion at an early time, when the influence of India operated\r\nstrongly in the spread of its doctrines. This influence is shown to\r\nthis day in the repetition of prayers in an unknown language, and\r\nthe retention of an Indian alphabet and writing--the Sanskrit or\r\nDevanagari--in all the religious works of Japan.\r\n\r\nSome of these divinities are so frequently heard of, and\r\nrepresentations of them, in pictures and carvings, are so common,\r\nthat even a slight acquaintance with their names and attributes is\r\nuseful. The different Buddhas are worshiped; Compera; the five hundred\r\n“Rakhan” or “Lohon”; the “Kwanon,” or goddess of mercy; and the “Stchi\r\nfuku jing,” or seven gods of riches. These last are generally drawn\r\nor carved on a boat, with emblems around them of long life, etc.--the\r\nstork, tortoise, a deer, a bag of money, a fir-tree, a bamboo, a\r\ncrystal ball, a fish. Their names are--Hotay Daikoku, Yaybissu, Benten,\r\nGayho, Bistamong, Fukowo kojiu. But the religion is more or less\r\npantheistic, and there are many other gods and divinities, even down to\r\nshapeless stones.\r\n\r\nTo “Ten sho dai jin” is attributed the origin of the imperial house,\r\nas is shown by the words of the Emperor, in a letter recently written\r\non the political position of affairs, “I am grieved, standing as I do\r\nbetween ‘Ten sho dai jin’ and my people.”\r\n\r\nIn the fifth generation after “Ten sho dai jin,” was born “Zinmu” or\r\n“Jin mu” (Chin: Shinwu--_i.e._, spirit of war). He was the first of\r\nthe earthly or human rulers. He is said to have been born in Fiuga, a\r\nmountainous province on the east side of Kiu siu, on the west coast\r\nof the Boo ngo Channel. This part of the islands is well suited for\r\ntrading purposes, and it is also well adapted for the landing of an\r\ninvading force, and it is not unlikely that Zinmu either originally\r\ncame from China, or was the son of some Chinese who had settled there,\r\nand who started thence on a design of conquest. At the time when he set\r\nout upon his career, the people of the country are said to have been\r\nhairy and uncivilized, but under the rule of a headman in each village.\r\nThe Japanese have to this day a great contempt for the people of Yezo,\r\nwho may be thus described, and they allege that similar tribes occupied\r\nthe whole of the islands, and that they were gradually driven back\r\nbefore the armies of Zinmu. It is more likely that they were conquered,\r\nand gradually amalgamated with their conquerors by the intermarriage of\r\nthese with native females, and that in this way, and by the effects of\r\nthe warm climate of the south, they lost that hirsute appearance which\r\nis so characteristic of the people of Yezo.--Aino, the name given to\r\nthe hairy inhabitants of Yezo by the Japanese, means “between,” and has\r\nreference to a contemptuous idea of the origin of these people from\r\na dog.--There are two strongly-marked varieties of feature in Japan,\r\nwhich are always strikingly portrayed in their own pictures. There is\r\nthe broad flat face of the lower classes, and the high nose and oval\r\nface of the higher. The difference is so marked as to be some argument\r\nin favor of a previous mixing of two different races; the one of which\r\nhad extended southward from the Kurile Islands and Siberia, hairy and\r\nbroad-featured; while the other had originated from the south, with\r\nIndian features and smooth skins.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese themselves do not pretend that there is any native\r\ndocumentary evidence in support of their history at the date of Zinmu,\r\nand the best writers allow that no writings prior to the seventh\r\ncentury are authentic. The introduction of Chinese letters into Japan\r\nis generally attributed to Onin, a learned man who came from Corea\r\nabout the year 285 A.D. But prior to the date of Onin, many of the\r\nnames of offices and officers were Chinese. It is hardly credible that,\r\nwith the communication which is known to have existed at different\r\ntimes between Japan and China, and also with Corea, there should have\r\ncontinued for so long a time such complete ignorance. More than one\r\nembassy had resided at the court of China for months. The Chinese\r\nannals speak of an embassy during the reign of the Han dynasty, A.D.\r\n238, when China was divided into “three kingdoms.” The ruler of Woo,\r\none of these three, proposed to invade Japan, but the expedition\r\nmiscarried. Nearly two centuries before this, in A.D. 57, an embassy\r\nwas sent from Japan to China by Sei nin, which arrived at the court of\r\nKwang ou, of the Eastern Han dynasty, in the last year of his reign.\r\nIt is unlikely that, residing as such an embassy must have done for a\r\nconsiderable time at the court of China, they should not have brought\r\naway some knowledge of letters or some instructors in reading and\r\nwriting. This Corean, Onin, may have been brought over to replace or to\r\nreteach what had been lost: for in more recent times it is known that,\r\nafter the long civil wars of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\r\nso little attention had been given to the instruction of youth that\r\nonly two men were found in the empire competent to teach the written\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWe may be permitted to believe that much of what became tradition had\r\nat one time been committed to writing, and that, corroborated as it is\r\nat some points by Chinese history, there is a foundation for much of\r\nthat part of history subsequent to the time of Zinmu, for the support\r\nof which there existed, when writing recommenced, no documentary\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR OF JAPAN\r\n\r\nThe line of gods carried on through godlike mortal descendants was\r\nprolonged in ordinary mortals, the first of whom was Zinmu. It is of\r\nlittle consequence by whom this pedigree was written or invented. It\r\nevidently was solely written for the then _de facto_ rulers of the\r\nland. It does not pretend to deal with the people of Japan, or with\r\nthe mode in which the peopling of the empire took place, but simply\r\ninvents and details a divine pedigree for one family. At the time when\r\nthis family is first heard of, the islands of Japan are acknowledged\r\nby Japanese historians to have been already peopled and divided into\r\nvillages, each under some municipal rule.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Zinmu is the era of Japan, and is placed at 667 years\r\nbefore Christ. Setting out from Miazaki in Fiuga, on the east side\r\nof the island of Kiusiu, he with troops under his command gradually\r\noverran that island, and the adjoining one of Sikok, together with\r\nthe west half of the island of Nippon, as far as the province of Mino\r\nto the east of Miako. Coming from the most rugged and comparatively\r\nbarren province in the empire, he was attracted by the beauty and\r\ndesirableness of the country around Miako. He settled at a place named\r\nKashiwarra or Kashiwabarra, a site near the city of Narra, about\r\nfifteen miles from the present capital. This choice of a site has been\r\nratified by every succeeding emperor, the Kio or capital (“King,”\r\nChinese) of the empire having been frequently changed, but never\r\nremoved to any great distance from the spot originally selected by\r\nZinmu.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the site is in every way most suitable for the capital of the\r\ncountry. It is, geographically, nearly in the center of the islands\r\nwhich constitute the empire. From the port of the capital, Osaka (or\r\nNaniwa, as it was named of old), a great fringe of the coast of the\r\nthree islands in almost land-locked waters is accessible to ships\r\nwithout their venturing into the open sea. To this port a large body\r\nof water is rolled down by the confluence of several rivers, which\r\nat one time were dispersed into several mouths and branches; but by\r\nlabor these have been collected and confined within two outlets. There\r\nis, in consequence, a large extent of alluvial ground producing rice\r\nand wheat for a numerous population. The inland water-communication\r\nextends to the large lake Owomi--upward of sixty miles in length and\r\neighteen in breadth; and thence, with an interval of a few miles only\r\nof land-carriage, to the port of Tsurunga, on the northern coast;\r\nwhile to the southeast, the natives report that there is uninterrupted\r\nwater-communication to Owarri, and thence to Sinano, and, with a short\r\ninterval of land-carriage, even to Yedo--whence, again, it extends\r\nnorthward by rivers and canals to the vicinity of Nambu. The city\r\nof Miako of the present day stands on a plain, among hills clothed\r\nwith wood, where art has done what it could to assist nature in the\r\ncompletion of landscape scenery, of the beauties of which the natives\r\nspeak with rapture. During twenty-four centuries, members of the family\r\nof Zinmu have sat upon the throne, and during that long time the palace\r\nhas been only at short intervals removed to any considerable distance\r\nfrom the site on which it at present stands.\r\n\r\nThe imperial residence in Japan is a very different structure from\r\nanything that European ideas of palaces would expect, being chiefly\r\nbuilt of wood and other materials so inflammable that a palace has\r\nbeen reconstructed and destroyed within a year. When we read of each\r\nemperor, at an early date, building a palace for himself, it is not to\r\nbe supposed that these were either expensive or very durable buildings.\r\nEach emperor seems to have occupied a different habitation from his\r\npredecessor, removing from one site to another, but generally keeping\r\nwithin the province of Yamashiro, or that adjoining, Yamato. Kwanmu, in\r\nthe year 794, built a palace on the site where the present city stands,\r\nand since his time Miako has been always looked upon as the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the Emperor of Japan is called, as a whole, “Kinri\r\ngo sho.” Though built of fine and expensive timber, it presents no\r\nappearance of that outward splendor which is generally considered by us\r\nto be necessary to an imperial residence. The roofs of the buildings\r\nare said to be white. It is surrounded by a common inclosure of wooden\r\nboarding. This inclosure is pierced by several gates. These entrances\r\nare graduated, and the settlement of the gate by which a great man\r\nshall make his entrance or his exit is a matter of no small importance\r\nat court. These gates lead into a large open space; in this is another\r\ninclosure (with other gates), in the center of which stands the wooden\r\nbuilding, the “Shi shin deng,” or imperial office, in which the emperor\r\nreceives the highest officers of the empire. This he appears to do\r\nalmost in the open air. The emperor does not sit upon a throne or\r\nchair, but is slightly raised above the floor--three of the ordinary\r\nmats of the country, placed one above the other, being used as a\r\nthrone. To the back of this public office is the residence or private\r\napartments of the emperor; and behind these are the female apartments\r\nof the empress, the empress-mother, and other high ladies.\r\n\r\nThe “Shi shin deng” (Ch. “Tsz shin tien”) faces to the south, to the\r\nlarge outer gate, the “Yio may mong”; within this is another gate of a\r\nred inclosure, the gate of the sun, “Hi no go mong.” On passing through\r\nthis, the large wooden-pillar-supported hall, with its roof with\r\nimmense eaves, is seen raised from the ground upon a lower framework\r\nof wood. Before it stand an orange and a cherry tree. Between these,\r\nsix steps lead up to the wooden gallery or veranda, which goes round\r\nthe hall under eaves projecting five or six feet from the supports. A\r\nlow balustrade surrounds this veranda. Under this large canopy of roof,\r\nalmost in the open air, the Emperor sits while he receives homage. The\r\n“Shi shin deng” occupies the red inclosure, having on the east side\r\na small wooden building for covering the car used in processions; to\r\nthe east of that is the building in which the “three jewels” are kept,\r\nthe “Naishi dokoro.” Within the “Shi shin deng” all extraordinary\r\nformal business of importance is transacted. The Shiogoon here presents\r\nhimself to the Emperor. In the long hall to the west of the “Shi shin\r\ndeng,” the “Say rio deng” (“Tsing liang tien”) or “Hiru no ma,” the\r\nmid-day room, ordinary business is transacted. Immediately in the\r\nrear of the “Shi shin deng” is the “Nai go bansho,” or inner hall for\r\nbusiness. To the east side, and overlooking the garden, is the “Tsunay\r\nno goteng,” or hall of meeting, or drawing-room. Behind, in the “Ko ngo\r\nsho,” the Emperor’s son and heir lives; here also are the apartments\r\nof the elder women. “Nanga Hashi no Tsubo nay” is the room in which\r\nlevees are held, where rank is given, and degradations or punishments\r\nare awarded. Formerly all the offices of the different departments of\r\ngovernment were in the neighborhood of the palace, but outside, at a\r\ndistance of one “cho,” or 120 yards.\r\n\r\nAt the back of all are the female apartments. On the east side, outside\r\nof the inclosure, is the Gakumonjo, or imperial school.\r\n\r\nTo the southeast of the whole is another inclosure, the “Ko een go\r\nsho,” the palace of the Emperor after he has abdicated, when he is\r\nknown as Kubo, covering a space of ground nearly as large as the\r\npalace inclosure. Adjoining this, and immediately to the south, is the\r\nresidence of the father or predecessor of the abdicated emperor. He is\r\nknown as Sento (Tsin tung). To the southwest is that of the empress\r\ndowager, and the females of the old emperor’s court. The Shi sin wo,\r\nor four royal families, are located in the neighborhood, while all\r\naround are the residences, with inclosures of ground, belonging to the\r\n“Go sekkay,” or “five assisting” families. Among these also is found\r\na small inclosure, the residence of the Sho shi dai, the envoy of the\r\nShiogoon at the imperial court.\r\n\r\nExcept the greater elevation and whiteness of the roofs, there is\r\nnothing to distinguish the palace from the adjacent streets. That\r\nthe Emperor should be thus housed probably involves a great state\r\nprinciple. The houses of Daimios and high officers are built in a\r\nmuch more durable manner. The Shiogoon’s residences at Osaka, Miako,\r\nYedo, and other places, are generally built more like fortifications\r\nor places of great strength. In similar style are raised the houses,\r\npalaces or forts of the Daimios in their respective provinces. It\r\ncannot, therefore, be from any fear of earthquakes that this style of\r\na plain wood-and-paper house is adopted, but it is probably founded on\r\nthe same principle as that on which the imperial pedigree is drawn up;\r\nviz., with the view of giving to it the appearance of a temple, and\r\nsurrounding the Emperor with the circumstances and attributes of a god.\r\n\r\nThis palace in Miako appears to be the only one now used by the\r\nEmperor. He is supposed to move from it temporarily only upon rare\r\noccasions. When he is obliged to change his residence, as when the\r\npalace is burned down, he occupies apartments in some one of the many\r\ntemples in the neighborhood. Any display of splendor in building is\r\nreserved for the Shiogoon, who has several palaces of great size\r\nand strength, as at Miako, Osaka, Fusimi, Yedo, Kofoo, Soonpoo, all\r\nof which are laid out on the plan of forts and built with a view to\r\ndefense from military attacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPAN AND HER ISLANDS]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, and often repeated, that the Emperor of Japan\r\nsits on a throne all day without moving his hands, or even his eyes;\r\nthat he is treated as a god, and that his subjects believe that the\r\nempire totters if he is unsteady. These are the exaggerations of the\r\nlower classes. There is no doubt that he is treated with the greatest\r\nreverence and respect--that he is, as it were, an ideal abstraction, a\r\nthing apart, necessary to the empire--that he is the Lord’s anointed,\r\nand not to be touched, and that no subject, however great he may be,\r\nor however firmly he may have grasped the power of the empire in the\r\nconvulsions of a revolutionary period, may contemplate placing himself\r\nupon that seat; and we shall find that two of the greatest men who\r\nrose to the highest power did not dare to take such a step, though\r\none, and perhaps both, proposed it to himself, and broached the idea\r\nto his followers. Though Nobunanga set up a representation of\r\nhimself to be worshiped, he did not set aside the Emperor; and though\r\nTaikosama proposed to depose the Emperor, his followers would not\r\nallow it, or at least dissuaded him from making the attempt. Still\r\nthe Emperor is not altogether looked upon as the spiritual being\r\nhe is generally represented in modern books. Indeed, in the first\r\nperiods of the history of the country the head of the empire was the\r\ncommander, the leader of the army. Zinmu led his army to victory; and\r\nlong after him the Empress Jinku Kogoo led her army into Corea. Her\r\nson Osin, better known by his posthumous title of Hatchimang, was at\r\nthe head of his army. But where there is no enemy to fight the post\r\nof commander-in-chief soon falls into abeyance. Japan has long been\r\nin this position--of having no enemy to watch or to attack. Such a\r\nposition entails, almost of necessity, the creation of a duality or\r\ndouble power. The weak condition to which the imperial court descended,\r\nafter it had been denuded of its power, and after the command of its\r\narmies had fallen from the hands of scions of the blood-royal into\r\nthose of other families, was followed by convulsions, civil wars, and\r\nbloodshed, till the people returned to a state of ignorance, and the\r\nfields to barrenness; but this seems only a consequence of having no\r\nenemy, no near neighbor with whom, by a process of constant watching\r\nand battling, as in Europe, the sinews of a nation are strengthened,\r\nand national feeling is concentrated into a unity.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the emperors show that, for long after the time of Zinmu,\r\nhis successors took an active part in the politics, the wars, and the\r\nintrigues of the state. It is not a matter of wonder that the hands\r\nwhich held the scepter should have become feeble during the fierce\r\ncivil wars which raged in the sixteenth century. The country would seem\r\nto have been driven by necessity to have two emperors--or at least,\r\ntwo opposing interests; and when the hereditary commander-in-chief\r\nhad in turn become a nonentity, one adventurer after another started\r\nup--first, Nobunanga; secondly, Taikosama; thirdly, Iyeyas, all able\r\nmen. The first battled with the Buddhist priesthood, the second turned\r\nhis arms against Corea, the third, the ablest of all, devised that\r\ndual system of seemingly divided empire, by which the power of the\r\nexecutive remained in the hands of the Shiogoon at Yedo, while the\r\nsource or fountain of honors remained with the Emperor in Miako. The\r\nconfiguration of the islands prevents their being cut into two empires;\r\nit remained for Iyeyas to devise a dual system by which peace has been\r\npreserved in a remarkable way for two hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nAs to the titles by which the Emperor is known, these are drawn in\r\nmost part from the Chinese, and denote, in language suited to Oriental\r\nideas, the illustrious position which he holds. The names express\r\nthe idea that he reigns by divine right. The oldest of these titles\r\nseems to be Mikoto. This is a Japanese word meaning “venerable,” and\r\ntranslated into Chinese, “tsun.” The word Mikado is more commonly\r\nused now, and is translated by the Chinese “Ti,” or emperor. The\r\nword “O” or “Wo” is the Chinese “Wang,” emperor; and the word “ten,”\r\nor heaven, is commonly added--“Ten wo,” the heavenly ruler; or the\r\ncombination “Owo,” or “Oho-wo,” meaning the great ruler, in which\r\nsense “Dai-wo” is also used. “Tenshi” is the “tien-tsi” of China, the\r\nson of heaven. “O-ooji,” the great family, is sometimes applied to\r\nthe Emperor. The common people talk of the Emperor as “Miyako sama,”\r\nin contradistinction to “Yedo sama,” the Shiogoon, the Lord of Yedo.\r\n“Ooyaysama,” or the superior lord, is also used. “Dairi,” made up of\r\ntwo Chinese words signifying the inner court or “the interior,” is\r\nequivalent to the words “the court” in English, and seems to include\r\nthe residences of the royal families and higher nobility. It is,\r\nhowever, sometimes applied to the Emperor himself, and sometimes to the\r\npalace as a building. The first word, “dai” is written both “great,”\r\n_ta_, and “inner,” _nai_. The latter seems the more common. “Gosho” is\r\na word sometimes applied to the palace, at others to the Emperor and\r\nthe government. The word “in,” or “een,” is a Buddhist word, added to\r\nthe posthumous name of some of the deceased emperors instead of “Ten\r\nwo.” In addition to these, other names are used, as “Kwo tei,” or ruler\r\nof the people, “Chokku,” etc.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period in the history of Japan, mention is made of\r\nthree things which necessarily appertain to the person who sits upon\r\nthe throne. They seem to be looked on as symbols of the imperial power,\r\nas palladia of the empire. In one of the treatises upon the Emperor’s\r\ncourt it is said of these mysterious emblems: “In that early time the\r\nheaven-illuminating god arrived at Kashiwabarra, then the capital, and\r\nplaced an eight-cubit mirror and a grass-shaving sword in the palace,\r\non the throne of the Emperor, and these received such homage as was\r\nrendered in the early times. The efficacy of the god was very great,\r\nso that the Emperor, dwelling with this god (these divine symbols),\r\nwas, as it were, equal to a god. Within the palace these things were\r\nlaid up, that the divine power might remain wherever these things were.\r\nAt that time (two high officers) regulated the sacrificial rites and\r\nceremonies until the tenth emperor, who, fearing the sacredness of the\r\ndivine presence, took these two efficacious symbols, the sword and the\r\nmirror, and put them away in another place, which was the origin of the\r\nidea of the Emperor sitting like a god in the place of a god.”\r\n\r\nIn this quotation only two things are mentioned--the sword and the\r\nmirror. A third is spoken of sometimes as a ball of crystal, at others\r\nas a seal, “sinji.” Klaproth calls it a ball of greenstone with two\r\nsmall round holes. The three things go by the name of “Sanjioo no\r\njinji.” During the long and bloody wars between the emperors of the\r\nnorth and south, in the sixteenth century, the former, who resided\r\nin Miako, and finally established himself on the throne, was not\r\nconsidered incontestably emperor until he obtained possession of these\r\nthree sacred symbols. Though the emperor of the south was hard pressed,\r\nand almost a refugee in the mountains, he kept possession of them, and\r\nfinally concluded a truce, delivering them up to his opponent, emperor\r\n_de facto_. On one occasion the three precious jewels were stolen, and\r\nafter being kept several months were recovered or sent back. On several\r\noccasions they have narrowly escaped destruction by fire, and in the\r\nyear 1040 A.D. the mirror was broken by the heat; but the pieces were\r\nrecognized and placed together. Within the last few years (in 1851)\r\nthey were again nearly exposed to a similar chance of destruction, but\r\nwere saved by Hoongay Hashimoto, who brought them out at the risk of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nIn Japan it is usual to perform a ceremony at the time when the boy\r\nassumes the _toga virilis_ and becomes a man. The age at which this\r\ntakes place is not settled, and seems to vary from the tenth to the\r\nfifteenth year. The eldest son of the Emperor undergoes this operation\r\n(known as “Gembuko”; Ch., “yuen fuh”) about the age of ten or eleven,\r\nwhen he, according to the custom, receives a new name. His hair is\r\nshaved off in the manner usual with men, and he assumes a dress. In\r\nall families the occasion is an important one, and in the case of the\r\nson of the Emperor, the heir-apparent, it becomes national. At the\r\ninauguration of the Emperor (according to Klaproth) his height is\r\nmeasured with a bamboo, which is deposited in one of the great temples\r\nin the province of Isse until his death, when it is removed to another,\r\nand revered as a spirit. With the bamboo of the reigning Emperor are\r\ndeposited a straw-hat, a grass rain-mantle, and a spade, emblems of\r\nagriculture, held in Japan as an occupation second only to that of the\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is said to have his eyebrows shaved, and to blacken his\r\nteeth every morning, which operation is effected by a mixture of\r\nsulphate of iron and some astringent bark. The state dresses of the\r\nEmperor are generally of very rich strong silk of a bright green\r\ncolor. The shape, the color, the pattern are all fixed, and not left\r\nto choice. His under garments are of white silk, and called “mookoo”;\r\nand this is the part of his dress which he never wears twice. Besides\r\nbeing changed every morning, there are other occasions during the day\r\nin which necessity demands a change. These white silk dresses are the\r\nperquisites of one of the servants, and are sold by him in Miako. The\r\nEmperor always uses cold water for bathing. The cups which he uses for\r\nhis meals are also broken; but when it is remembered that the Chinese\r\nand Japanese style of eating requires only one cup, and this perhaps\r\nnot a very expensive one, the total does not amount to a large sum in\r\nthe annual budget. He is said to devote his time to business matters,\r\nwith discussions upon history, laws, and religion. In times past he has\r\ntaken but little part in the business of the country; but his share\r\nin this is every year upon the increase, and he is courted by those\r\nwho see in what direction political power is tending. The power of\r\nconferring titles and rank may have given him an amount of occupation\r\nand an acquaintance with mankind which would hardly leave him the\r\nnonentity he has generally been described. Twelve days of the month are\r\nset apart for conversations and discussions upon the history, laws,\r\nand religion of Japan. Such spare time as he has is devoted to the\r\ncomposition of poetry, with music and chess. The Emperor is supposed\r\nto move out of his palace and the grounds and gardens adjoining only\r\ntwice a year--once during spring, and once in autumn--when he goes in\r\na covered car, inclosed by semi-transparent screens of bamboo, drawn\r\nby large bullocks, to visit the environs of Miako. This procession is\r\nknown as “Miyuki” or “Gokowo.”\r\n\r\nOn this state procession the Emperor is accompanied by all the high\r\nofficers in Miako. He does not always strictly adhere to this rule of\r\nseclusion, however. Twenty-five years ago Kokaku was in the practice of\r\nwalking about the town with his son, afterward Jin-ko, dressed like a\r\ncommon man. The excuse for this was that his palace was being rebuilt,\r\nafter having been burned down. After the Emperor has abdicated no\r\nrestrictions are placed upon him.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, like the majority of his countrymen, is a vegetarian in\r\nhis diet, and, in addition, eats only fish. At one time such animal\r\nfood as venison was considered fit for royalty; but the story goes\r\nthat the Emperor Ssu-jio heard one evening a doe crying plaintively\r\nfor her mate. On the succeeding morning he came to the conclusion\r\nthat some venison for his breakfast was the missing lover; and, ever\r\nsince, venison has not been included among the dainties of the royal\r\nkitchen. In his time the Emperor and all his court began to wear the\r\nstiff-starched ample robes still used, and the long “kio” or train,\r\nwhich was introduced to prevent the feet of retreating courtiers being\r\nseen. On leaving the presence of the Emperor, officers walk backward on\r\ntheir knees.\r\n\r\nSome writers have alleged that the Emperor is looked upon as a god,\r\nand that the people think that he goes in the eleventh month to the\r\nmeeting of the spirits, the “kami.” This meeting is believed by the\r\nlower classes in Japan to take place during the eleventh month in the\r\nprovince of Idzumo, at the temple of Oyashiro, which temple is thus\r\nhonored because the first spirit dwelt there. At this meeting the\r\nspirits arrange the sublunary and mundane business of Japan for the\r\nsubsequent eleven months. The inhabitants of Idzumo call this month\r\n“Kami ari tski,” or the spirit month. All the other provinces call it\r\n“Kami nashi tski,” the month without spirits. The Emperor is supposed\r\nto be above all the kami or spirits, inasmuch as he can confer honors\r\nupon the dead; but he is not looked upon as above the “Tento sama,” or\r\nLord of heaven, showing that a lower position is assigned to the kami\r\n(or “Shin” of the Chinese) than to the highest deity. But no one of\r\nany ordinary education in Japan believes that the Emperor goes to this\r\nmeeting of spirits; these ideas, like many others similar in China,\r\nare only current among the least educated of the people. During this\r\nmonth, when the spirits are so occupied, none of those ceremonies in\r\nwhich their assistance must be invoked, such as marriages, adoptions,\r\netc., takes place; no prayers are offered, as the spirits are supposed\r\nto be engaged. At this meeting they arrange all the marriages which are\r\nto take place during the ensuing year. Each individual in this world,\r\nmale and female, is supposed to have a thread of existence, “yeng.”\r\nThe spirits take the pairs of threads of those who are to be joined in\r\nmatrimony and knot them together. So we speak of marriages being made\r\nin heaven while the hymeneal knot is tied on earth. From this the month\r\nis called “Yeng moosoobi tski”--_i.e._, Tie-the-knot month.\r\n\r\nAbdication from positions of active life is very common among all ranks\r\nin Japan. No position seems to be more easily renounced than that of\r\nthe occupation of the throne. In a country where the heir may have the\r\nmisfortune to be brought up in the lap of luxury, and amid sensual\r\nexcitements and indulgences of every kind, it is not surprising that\r\nthe irksomeness of his position should make the holder sigh to be\r\nrelieved from it, or that vigor of mind or body is only to be found in\r\nthose cases where, the heir-apparent having been cut off, the successor\r\nhas been adopted at a late period of his life, having been reared\r\nwithout the expectation of subsequent elevation. After the Emperor has\r\nabdicated he is named “Tai sho ten wo”--equivalent to “His most exalted\r\nand sacred Majesty.” At the present day, upon his taking this step,\r\nshould he devote himself to religion and become “Fo wo,” his head is\r\nshaved, and he retires to a monastic life, and generally occupies the\r\ntemple Ninaji or Omuro in the neighborhood of Miako.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are unostentatious in their customs, and in the treatment\r\nof their great ones after death are singularly undemonstrative.\r\nConsidering that all the rites connected with the dead are after\r\nthe Buddhist ritual, and that the Chinese devote so much money and\r\nsoil to the tombs and monuments of their ministers and great men and\r\nwomen, something of the same veneration might be expected in Japan.\r\nBut, on the contrary, the tombs are generally very small unpretending\r\nstructures, consisting of a basement, upon which a single stone is\r\nerected of no great size. Such is the tomb of Yoritomo, the great hero,\r\nin the neighborhood of Kamakura; and such, we are told, are the tombs\r\nof the emperors. They are covered over with a roofing of straw, to keep\r\nbefore their countrymen and subjects the remembrance of their primeval\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nAs to the succession to the throne, the laws or regulations in Japan\r\ndo not seem to be very decided. The frequent abdication of the ruler\r\ngives the opportunity for securing that his successor shall have all\r\nthe weight and assistance that the predecessor can give to overcome\r\nthe pretensions of rival claimants. When the death of the Emperor has\r\nsuddenly left the throne vacant, the eldest son is supposed to be the\r\nrightful heir. But when, as frequently has happened, his mind and\r\nbody have been enfeebled by dissipation, and he has neither wit nor\r\nvigor to seize the reins of power, he has too often been supplanted by\r\nthe ambition of a brother, or a wife of his father. When the Emperor\r\nleaves only a daughter, she is married to a member of the four imperial\r\nfamilies, and her husband in that case becomes Emperor. In reality, the\r\nmost powerful party about the court, when any difficulty occurs, puts\r\nin and supports the member of the imperial family most favorable to\r\ntheir continuing in power.\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of the Emperors is considered true and authentic as\r\npublished in the Red Book of the empire; the pedigree of the Shiogoon\r\nis looked upon as made up. The former is to be found fully detailed\r\nfrom native sources in the works of Klaproth and Kæmpfer. The “Oon jo\r\nmay rang” is the title of a small book giving the pedigrees and crests\r\nof the Emperor’s family, and of the koongays or nobility. Two crests\r\nor coats-of-arms are used by the Emperor--the one, “kiku,” for outside\r\nimperial government business, like the flower of a chrysanthemum, with\r\nsixteen petals; the other, the “kiri,” is used for the palace matters\r\npersonal to the Emperor and his family. No notice seems to be taken of\r\nthe common assumption of the imperial crest, but no one dares to use\r\nthe crest of the Shiogoon except by permission.\r\n\r\nThe following sayings give some idea of the reverence with which the\r\nEmperor is spoken of: “Mikado ni ooji nashi,” is a saying to express\r\nthat the Emperor is of no family. “Tenshi foo bo nashi”--“The Emperor\r\nhas neither father nor mother.” “In heaven there is one sun, on earth\r\nthere is one Emperor,” is a Confucian saying in accordance with the\r\nideas of the country. “O wo wa jiu zenn, kami wa ku zenn”--“The power\r\nof the Emperor is as ten, that of the gods as nine”; implying that more\r\nreverence is due to the Emperor than to the lesser spirits, and that\r\nhe has more power. “The Emperor all men respect, the Shiogoon all men\r\nfear.” “Heaven is his father, earth is his mother, his friends are the\r\nsun and moon.” Such ideas are taken from the Chinese classics.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor marries one wife, who is the Empress. He is allowed by the\r\nlaws of the country to take twelve concubines, who are generally the\r\ndaughters of the poorer nobility. The throne can be, and has frequently\r\nbeen, occupied by a female. The Emperor is supposed to receive, as an\r\nallowance from the Shiogoon, 100,000 kobangs, equal to $350,000 per\r\nannum. This he receives from the Yedo government, but he probably has\r\na large revenue from land in the “Go ki nai” or “Go ka koku,” or five\r\nprovinces. He is said to complain of the duties from foreign trade not\r\nbeing paid into his treasury, inasmuch as when the trade was conducted\r\nformerly by the Portuguese at Sakkye, the Emperor received the duties;\r\nbut as Yokohama is out of the Gokinai, the Shiogoon prefers that the\r\nduties should flow to Yedo. These five provinces are frequently spoken\r\nof by the writers of the sixteenth century as the Tensee--heavenly\r\nor sacred soil. They are Yamashiro, Yamato, Setsu, Kaawdsio, and\r\nIdzumi. The whole empire is spoken of, as in China, as all under\r\nheaven--“Tenka.”\r\n\r\nTwo officers in the Emperor’s palace are appointed from Yedo--two\r\nHattamoto, or inferior barons--to superintend the disbursement of\r\nmoney, and to keep accounts of the money paid by the Shiogoon’s\r\ngovernment. These men have fifty soldiers under them. Under them are\r\nnine “Toritsungi,” generally men of some rank and position.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s own private establishment consists of the following\r\nofficers:\r\n\r\n1. Makanye Kashira, generally a Hattamoto, who keeps the accounts of\r\nthe imperial table and pays the money.\r\n\r\n2. Kye mon tskye, called “Kimsakye,” two Hattamoto, who go to buy the\r\nprovisions for the palace.\r\n\r\n3. Go zembang, six men, whose business is to examine the Emperor’s food.\r\n\r\n4. Shuri siki, five men, to look after the buildings; generally Miako\r\nmen of old families.\r\n\r\n5. Makanye kata, six men, whose duty is to say what, and how much, is\r\nto be purchased for the palace.\r\n\r\n6. Gim miakoo and Itamoto--of the former three, of the latter\r\nseventeen--head cooks and ordinary cooks.\r\n\r\n7. Kangay bang, keepers of the keys, seven men.\r\n\r\n8. Sosha bang, messengers.\r\n\r\n9. Tskye bang or Kashira, three men, lower messengers.\r\n\r\nThese are all given in the official list as the ordinary household in\r\ndaily attendance on the emperor.\r\n\r\nAfter his death an honorific title is given to the deceased Emperor, by\r\nwhich he is subsequently known in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHI SINWO, OR FOUR IMPERIAL FAMILIES\r\n\r\nThe “Shi sinwo” (“sz tsan wang”) are “four imperial relatives,” or\r\nroyal families of Japan. This name denotes four families of imperial\r\ndescent set apart, with allotted residences and revenues, as supporters\r\nto the imperial family. The families are cadets of the royal line\r\ndescended from junior branches. From among the members of these four\r\nfamilies, in case of failure of male heirs of the body, an heir to the\r\nthrone, or a husband to the Princess Imperial, is to be sought.\r\n\r\nIn Japan all ranks are under laws more or less strict, and from such\r\nthe imperial family does not escape. The succession to the throne,\r\nat all times an object in Eastern countries for daring ambition to\r\naim at, and a fruitful source of revolution and misery to the people,\r\nis regulated and guarded in Japan on a basis wide enough to secure a\r\nsuccession, and preserved by such safeguards as to put it out of the\r\npower of collaterals to hope for success from intriguing ambition. One\r\nof these safeguards is supposed to be in the Emperor’s being allowed\r\nto take twelve concubines over and above his lawful wife, the Empress.\r\nThese are generally daughters of men of high rank about the court,\r\nand the son of any one of them, if there is no son by the Empress,\r\nmay succeed. If there be a daughter, she marries one of the members\r\nof these four families, and he becomes Emperor. Jinko, the father of\r\nthe late Emperor, succeeded in this way. His father, Kokaku, was a\r\nmember of the royal Kunnin family, and married the only daughter of\r\nthe Emperor, and so became Emperor. He had a concubine, the daughter\r\nof Koongay Kwadjooji. The wife and the concubine had each one son.\r\nSatchay no mia was the son of the wife, and heir-apparent to the\r\nthrone. But the concubine was a fierce, jealous woman, and determined\r\nthat her son should succeed, and she poisoned Satchay. It was the duty\r\nof the Shiogoon’s envoy, Sakkye, to inquire into the reports that\r\nwere circulating; and having done so, he discovered the truth, and\r\nput the concubine into confinement. But, though the Emperor was much\r\ndistressed, he loved her too well and insisted on her being released.\r\nThe government at Yedo heard of what had happened, and required the\r\nenvoy to give his reasons for releasing her, when she had committed\r\nso heinous a crime. He committed suicide. Her son, Jinko, it is said,\r\nalways paid the Empress the greatest respect, and would never see his\r\nown mother afterward.\r\n\r\nBut even with this wide matrimonial basis allowed to the Emperor, there\r\nmay be a failure of heirs direct. These four families are therefore\r\nestablished as a further safeguard to the succession.\r\n\r\nThey take their names from collateral branches of the imperial house,\r\nbeing originally the families of younger sons of previous Emperors. At\r\npresent there are only two families of Sinwo, two having become extinct\r\nby failure of heirs. They are, however, only dormant, as it is a part\r\nof the policy of the state that these families should be in existence,\r\nand it is in the power of the Emperor to put one of his sons into,\r\nas it were, the extinct family--that is, to call him by the name and\r\ngive him the revenues belonging to the house, which revenues have been\r\naccruing until the family is re-established.\r\n\r\nThe four families are called collectively Shi (four) sin (relations) wo\r\n(imperial). The sons of these families are called Sinwo O’nkatta, or\r\nO’nkatta sama [O’nkatta is used as an address of respect to ladies, and\r\nalso to Sinwo and high officers in personal attendance on the Emperor],\r\nand from these sons a successor to the Emperor may be taken.\r\n\r\nThe names of the four “families” are--1, Fusimi; 2, Arisungawa; 3,\r\nKatsura; 4, Kunnin. Of these the last two are the dormant houses. The\r\nrevenues of these two houses are managed by factors or agents, and the\r\nfourth is said to be very wealthy.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the two existing families are:\r\n\r\n1. Fusimi no mia, who has a nominal revenue of 1,016 koku[1] of rice;\r\nbut he has probably twenty or thirty thousand koku. The present man is\r\na Koboong of Jinko, the late Emperor.\r\n\r\nThis “boong” is a voluntary union between two persons, and is quite\r\ndifferent from adoption. It is more of the character of a Masonic\r\nconnection. In the relation of a child he is called Koboong; of a\r\nfather, Oyaboong; of brothers or sisters, Kiodaiboong: and this\r\nconnection is a very common tie between two individuals in Japan, as\r\nwell as in China, to help and assist each other. It runs through all\r\nranks and both sexes. It is a connection which may be as easily severed\r\nas it is made, but it is often strictly adhered to. It is generally\r\nmade by drinking formally out of the same cup, each taking half of\r\nthe liquor. It may be severed by cutting off the queue, or simply by\r\nformally intimating that it is at an end.\r\n\r\n2. Arisungawa Nakatskasa no kio, or head of the Central Board. His\r\nnominal income is 1,000 koku, but his real revenue is much larger.\r\n\r\n3. Katsura; the revenue is 3,006 koku.\r\n\r\n4. Kunnin; the revenue is nominally 1,006 koku.\r\n\r\nIn these families there is generally a sufficient number from among\r\nwhom to select a successor in case of the death, or what seems more\r\ncommon in Japan, the abdication and retirement, of the Emperor. But,\r\nat the same time, the arrangement has its disadvantages. It places\r\na number of men and women of all ages in a very high position, with\r\napparently no occupation for their leisure time. These men might\r\nbecome troublesome in the state by carrying on intrigues for their own\r\nadvancement and for the gratification of their ambition. Within the\r\nlast few years much disquietude has been caused by one of the Sinwo\r\nengaging in intrigues to upset the reigning Emperor. A means has been\r\narrived at for at once giving these persons income, business, position,\r\nand at the same time getting them out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist priesthood was at one time a very powerful element in the\r\ncountry. The number of priests was very great, and the revenues of\r\nthe monasteries were enormous. By their wealth, and from among their\r\nvassals, they were able to keep up a respectable army; and not by their\r\nvassals alone--the priests themselves filled the ranks. The different\r\nsects built magnificent temples, and these were endowed with ample\r\nlands. Immediately before the period of the advent of the Christians\r\nin the sixteenth century, the power of the priesthood seems to have\r\nreached its highest point. Nobunanga, who at one time was inclined to\r\nfavor the foreign priests, had always a great jealousy of, and bore a\r\ngreat ill-will to, the Buddhist priesthood. He destroyed their temples,\r\nkilled their priests, and confiscated their revenues, and thus gave\r\na blow to their power from which they have never recovered, and under\r\nwhich they are withering more and more every day.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, a man while a priest, after having shaved his head and taken\r\nthe vows, is supposed to be out of the world, and it is then much\r\neasier to keep a certain amount of surveillance over him, and to see\r\nthat he is attending to his duties, and is not engaged in political\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\nOf the larger Buddhist temples of different sects, fourteen are\r\nretained as having the largest revenues; and whenever a male member of\r\nthe royal family is unprovided for he is put in as head abbot or bishop\r\nof one of these temples. They are generally appointed while children,\r\nand brought up to the position; and as the revenues of the office have\r\nthus time to accumulate, the reverend holder has sufficient for his\r\nwants and those of a respectable retinue. They are then called Sinwo\r\nMonzekke (Muntsih).\r\n\r\n1. The first is Rinoji Monzekke, or abbot of Rinoji temple. The temple\r\nover which he is abbot is To yay zan, in Yedo. The first high-priest\r\nput into this was Koboong of Iyeyas, then Shiogoon. The revenue amounts\r\nto 13,000 koku of rice. The holder is of the Arisungawa family, and is\r\nof the first rank and second degree. He is known as “Kwan rayee no mia”\r\n(from the nengo, or date, of his appointment), and Yedo no mia or Ooyay\r\nno mia. In 1860 the incumbent was very old, and a boy, Gofutay, of the\r\nFusimi family, was appointed assistant and successor.\r\n\r\n2. The second is Ninaji no mia, otherwise called Omuro. The income is\r\n1,502 koku. The incumbent is of the Fusimi family. He is head of the\r\nSingong sect, and was appointed to the office in 1843, when four years\r\nof age. To this temple the Emperor generally retires should he become a\r\npriest after abdication.\r\n\r\n3. Dai Kakuji, otherwise called Sanga, is vacant.\r\n\r\n4. Mio ho in, at Hiyayzan, a large temple near Miako. The Monzekke is\r\nof the Kunnin family. He is head of the Tendai sect of Buddhists, and\r\nis known as Tendai zass.\r\n\r\n5. Sho ngo in no Monzekke is head of the Yamabooshi religion. He is of\r\nthe Fusimi family, with an income of 1,430 koku. His temple is at Omine\r\nHonzan.\r\n\r\n6. Sho ko in; vacant, but the revenues are held by No. 5.\r\n\r\n7. Say ray in Monzekke: is known as Awata Mia. He is of the Fusimi\r\nfamily. The income is 1,330 koku.\r\n\r\n8. Chi wong in Monzekke, of the Arisungawa family. The temple is in\r\nMiako, and he is the head of the Jodoshiu sect of Buddhists.\r\n\r\n9. Kwajooji is vacant.\r\n\r\n10. Itchi jo in Monzekke. The temple is in Narra, and is very old. Held\r\nby one of the house of Fusimi.\r\n\r\n11. Kaji ee Monzekke, of the Tendai sect. Of the family of Fusimi, with\r\nan income of 1,600 koku.\r\n\r\n12. Manjo in Monzekke is vacant.\r\n\r\n13. Bissa mondo Monzekke is also vacant.\r\n\r\n14. Emmang in Monzekke, commonly called Medora, in the province of\r\nOwomi, is also vacant.\r\n\r\nAll these bishoprics, as they may be called, are held, or may be held,\r\nby Sinwo or sons of Sinwo.\r\n\r\nBut as it is in many countries, both European and Eastern, as necessary\r\nand as difficult to dispose of the females of high families as the\r\nmales, they also are in many cases provided for.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-four temples or nunneries which are, or may be,\r\nunder the superintendence of daughters or relatives of the four royal\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n1. Daijoji, in Miako; of this temple a daughter of the Emperor was\r\nformerly abbess.\r\n\r\n2. Hokio ji.\r\n\r\n3. Dan kay in.\r\n\r\n4. Ko shio in.\r\n\r\n5. Ray gan ji, held by one of the Fusimi family, who has the title of\r\nNio-wo, or Queen of Nuns.\r\n\r\n6. Yenshoji, in Narra, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Japan.\r\n\r\n7. Rin kinji.\r\n\r\n8. Chiu goji and sixteen others of lower class. Many of them are,\r\nhowever, unoccupied; partly, perhaps, from want of ladies of the royal\r\nfamily to fill them, and partly from failure of zeal for the Buddhist\r\nreligion all over the country.\r\n\r\nThe laws with reference to the perpetuity of the vows of these priests\r\nand priestesses do not seem to be very strict, as we find that, when\r\nopportunity offers, the garb is thrown off, the hair is allowed to\r\ngrow, and he or she mixes again in the world in whatever capacity their\r\nworldliness, their ambition, or their sense, has prompted them to\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the Emperor, as the fountain of honor,\r\nreserves to himself the sole right of conferring titles and rank.\r\nThis reservation throws great political power into his hands, the\r\nacquisition of title and rank being, with rare exceptions, an object of\r\nthe highest ambition to a Japanese. The amount of business connected\r\nwith this power is great, and may be said to have been for many\r\nyears the sole occupation for the Miako court. A special office and\r\nofficers are set apart within the palace inclosure for carrying on the\r\ncorrespondence and settling disputes connected with the department.\r\n\r\n\r\nRANKS OF MEN IN JAPAN\r\n\r\nEvery individual in Japan, whether noble, priest or peasant, is\r\nsupposed to know the rank in which he stands relatively to those\r\nabout him. The marks of respect to superiors--which in degree\r\nappear excessive to Western nations--are graduated from a trifling\r\nacknowledgment to the most absolute prostration. When two men or women\r\nmeet, the first point to be ascertained seems to be, which of the two\r\nis to make the acknowledgment of the social position of the other.\r\nThis state of things is supported by law as well as custom, and more\r\nparticularly by the permission given to a two-sworded man, in case of\r\nhis feeling himself insulted, to take the law into his own hands. What\r\nwould be irksome to us seems to become easy and a matter of course in\r\nJapan; and though, no doubt, the assumption of position is often the\r\nsource of brawls and fights, the system works more smoothly than might\r\nhave been expected.\r\n\r\nThe custom of wearing two swords was introduced in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The old Miako nobility do not adopt the custom--civilian\r\nKoongays wearing no sword, and military only one as of old. All Japan\r\nis divided into two classes: those who have a right to wear two swords,\r\nthe “Nihon sashi shto” or “two-sworded man,” called also “Yashiki\r\nshto” or castle retainers; and those who have no such right, the\r\n“Matchi shto” or street man (otherwise called Chonin). The latter class\r\ncomprises merchants, artisans, workmen, etc., who work at some trade,\r\nbut possess no ground; and also Hiaksho, farmers who do not trade, but\r\nfarm or rent ground. In some cases individuals of these classes can\r\nwear two swords. The “swordless man” in Yedo pays rent for his ground,\r\nhouse and shop. The “two-sworded man” pays no rent and no taxes,\r\nbecause he is not allowed to trade. In Yedo, parts of the town are\r\nknown as “Matchi tsuchee,” street ground, and other parts as “Yashiki\r\ntsuchee,” castle ground. Persons living on the former can open shops\r\nand trade; in the latter this is not allowed. This last two-sworded\r\nclass is known as “Samurai” (Ch. Sz), which may be translated “an\r\nofficer and a gentleman,” and is an important distinction conferring\r\nvaluable rights and privileges at the expense of the rest of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThis division of the people into two classes is a measure issuing from\r\nthe executive at Yedo, the Shiogoon’s government, rather than from\r\nMiako. The Samurai class may be said to include the Koongays, the\r\nDaimios, the “Jiki sang,” who are the officers and sub-officers in the\r\nservice of the Shiogoon; the Byshing--_i.e._, officers in the service\r\nof Daimios; and such Chonin as are doing duty as officers in some large\r\ntown, such as Osaka or Miako, and are always spoken of in connection\r\nwith the city--as Osaka chonin, for instance. The term “Samurai” is\r\napplied more particularly to all below the fifth rank, military or\r\ncivilians who are not merchants or artisans. There are others who\r\nhave the right to wear two swords, such as Goshi, large farmers or\r\nlanded proprietors whose ancestors were Daimios. These are strongest\r\nin the provinces of Kahi, Etsjiu and Dewa, some being very wealthy--as\r\nHomma in Dewa, and Hanagura in Etsjiu. The Samurai who have the right\r\nto wear two swords assume the right of giving two swords to their\r\nattendants; and this right, once assumed, is not readily relinquished,\r\nseeing that a two-sworded man has the privilege of traveling at a much\r\ncheaper rate than other members of society, pays no tolls or taxes,\r\nand not infrequently pays nothing for food and lodging, their power\r\nbeing so great that they are feared, if not in actual attendance upon\r\nsome superior. These men are frequently dismissed by, or voluntarily\r\nleave the service of, their Daimio or master; but as those who are so\r\ndismissed are often brawlers, they retain their swords, and gain a\r\nliving by their becoming a terror to quiet people. They are said to be\r\n“floating,” without any attachment, like straws on a stream, and are\r\nthence called “Ronin” or “floating-man.” These men are most imperious\r\nand domineering toward others not having the same privileges as\r\nthemselves, and this power compels wealthy traders and others to enroll\r\nthemselves in the retinue of some Daimio, or take some other roundabout\r\nmode to prevent themselves being insulted. This is not the character of\r\nevery Ronin, many of whom are respectable members of society, holding\r\ntheir privileges in abeyance until called upon to give feudal service\r\nby some superior.\r\n\r\nThe people of Japan are divided generally into the following classes:\r\n\r\n1. Koongays, or Miako nobility.\r\n\r\n2. Daimios, or Yedo nobility.\r\n\r\n3. Hattamoto--Lower Daimio class.\r\n\r\n4. Hiaksho--Farmers and landed proprietors without rank or title.\r\n\r\n5. Shokonin--Artisans, carpenters, etc.\r\n\r\n6. Akindo--Merchants.\r\n\r\n7. Kweiamono--Actors, beggars, etc.\r\n\r\n8. Yayta--Tanners, shoemakers, leather workers, skinners.\r\n\r\nBeneath these are prostitutes, and all connected with them, who are\r\nconsidered beasts, or on a level with them.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the name of “Koongay” (Kung kia), “exalted house,” the\r\nnobility of Miako, the Daimios and officers of the Shiogoon’s court,\r\nare called “Jee ngay” (Ti hia), meaning persons low, on a level with\r\nthe ground, the latter not being recognized by the Emperor as feudal\r\nlords further than as servants of his servant, “Tokungawa”--_i.e._ the\r\nShiogoon.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese titles and classification of officers have been taken\r\ngenerally from China. As in China, all the officers honored with titles\r\nby the Emperor, or performing duties about the court, are divided into\r\nclasses or ranks. In China the Mandarins are divided into nine classes.\r\nEach of these classes is again subdivided into a first and secondary\r\ndivision. The same division and subdivision are found in Japan, with\r\nthis difference, that there are six classes, each subdivided into four\r\nranks. The word used for rank is I, otherwise called Kurai. This is the\r\nChinese word Wai. The six ranks in order are, Itchi-i, Ni-i, Sanm-i,\r\nShi-i, Go-i and Roko-i. Each of these is divided according to the\r\nChinese classification into two, the “shio” (or “jio”) and the “jiu,”\r\ncorresponding to the “ching” and the “tsung.” These are subdivided\r\nagain into two--upper and lower--“jio” and “gay,” the Chinese “shang”\r\nand “hia.” The full description of men of the first and second ranks\r\nwould be respectively “Jo itchi-i no jio” and “Jo itchi-i no gay”--the\r\n“no” meaning “of.” The minor divisions “jio” and “gay” are not much\r\nused in the higher ranks until the highest is reached, an honor now\r\nreserved only for the dead. Indeed, all below Shi-i, or the fourth\r\ngrade, are commonly known now by a general name, “Sho dai boo” (“Chu\r\nta fu”). The higher classes wear at court distinguishing dresses and\r\ncolors, or devices upon black dresses, and they are entitled in virtue\r\nof their rank to have a spear carried before them when moving about\r\nofficially. Officers are presented at court, both at Miako and Yedo,\r\naccording to their rank, not according to the importance of their\r\noffice. Few of the Daimios are higher than the first subdivision of the\r\nfourth rank. The Shiogoon himself is elevated from one rank to another\r\nby the favor of the Emperor, at times not rising higher than the first\r\nsubdivision of the second class. To attain such rank at the imperial\r\ncourt is the great object of ambition in Japan, and next in importance\r\nis the acquisition of a title conferred by the Emperor. But as some\r\ntitles, though not recognized at court, are used by the Daimios as\r\nholding territory under the Shiogoon, there is a distinction observed\r\nbetween the two. The holders of titles conferred by the Emperor are\r\nknown as “Kio kwang” (King kwan) or imperial officers, while the\r\nDaimios are known from their territorial appellations as “Kooni kami”\r\n(Kwoh shau), or keepers of the provinces. An imperial title in the\r\naddress is always placed before the territorial title.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KOONGAY\r\n\r\nAfter the Emperor and royal families, the first in rank in the state\r\nare the Koongays. Until further light be thrown upon Japanese history,\r\nthe remote origin of this class will be somewhat obscure, some tracing\r\ntheir pedigree back upward of 1,500 years. Many of the Koongays are\r\ndescendants of younger sons and cadets of the imperial family branching\r\noff at former periods, while the surnames of some of the other families\r\nare as old as historic records. In all probability their forefathers\r\ncame over to Japan at the time of its invasion and conquest by Zinmu,\r\nand being the assistants, brothers in arms, and mainstays of his\r\nthrone and power, the soil about the center of the empire was divided\r\namong them, and they thenceforward became the nobility of the court\r\nof the Emperor. So long as the empire was under one emperor who ruled\r\nvigorously, this aristocracy seems to have existed in the central\r\nprovinces as feudal lords, much in the same way as the Daimios of\r\nthe present day. But when the vigor of rule relaxed, and power fell\r\ninto the hands of a commander-in-chief, or mayor of the palace, with\r\nuncertainty in the rulers, there followed division in the aristocracy.\r\nPrevious to the beginning of the fifteenth century, the western part\r\nof the empire was all that was known to any who could throw light\r\nupon its position by writing. The large tract of country to the north\r\nand northeast of Yedo, called the obscure or unpenetrated way, was\r\ncomparatively unknown and uninhabited, and was divided into four or\r\nfive large territories, under princes who seldom heard of, and more\r\nrarely visited, the court at Miako. The dissensions and struggles for\r\npower between the two powerful families of Heji and Genji gave rise to\r\na nearly continual state of civil war for upward of 200 years. During\r\nthe Onin war families were destroyed, territories were lost, might was\r\neverywhere right, and though several of the oldest and noblest families\r\namong the Koongays retained their honors and titles and places about\r\nthe court, they lost their property, and many have ever since remained\r\nat the lowest ebb of poverty.\r\n\r\nThose few noble families which had previously to this period of civil\r\nwar divided among themselves the places and titles of the court,\r\nwere denuded of their splendor; but their representatives continued\r\nto struggle on with poverty, proud in the possession of an ancient\r\nlineage, and of their names being enrolled as nobles in the Great Book\r\nof the empire. These are the Koongays of the present day. They are\r\nnot all in this state of poverty, many of them being well off, and\r\nsome very wealthy; but others are very poor, and eke out the scanty\r\nsubsistence given them by the Emperor by painting, basket-making,\r\nand other manual employments, affording, in their persons, their\r\npoverty, and their pretensions, ample scope for the pen of the native\r\ncaricaturist. The names, history, and pedigree of the Koongays are\r\nenrolled in the Great Book of the empire, the equivalent to the\r\nHeralds’ Office or Patent Office of England. A book, the “Koongay\r\nno Kayzu,” or Pedigree of the Koongays, is printed in Japan, giving\r\nall these particulars, and is generally by the natives considered\r\nauthentic. The names of Daimios (as such) are not so enrolled; they\r\nhave no patents of nobility from the Emperor, and the “Hang campu,”\r\ngiving the pedigree and history of the families of Daimios, is regarded\r\nas anything but authentic, and is looked upon as in many cases made up\r\nby individuals to conceal the origin of the family.\r\n\r\nThe Koongay class includes all the illustrious families of Japan. In\r\ncommon estimation the Daimios are far below this class; and even the\r\nShiogoon, though he is feared as the head of the executive, is looked\r\nupon as comparatively a parvenu.\r\n\r\nThe class is divided into two, an older or higher, the “Koongio,” and\r\na lower, or more recently created, “Ten jio bito” (Tien shang jin).\r\n“Koongio” (Kung hiang) is a name which includes all the officers of\r\nthe first, second and third ranks. All of the fourth rank and below\r\nare called “So shing,” in which are included “Ten jio bito,” “Sho\r\ndiabu,” and “Samurai.” The appellation “Mayka” (ming kia) seems to\r\ndenote that the bearer is a civilian. All the higher offices in the\r\nstate are filled by Koongays, but only five families are eligible to\r\nfill the highest. These five families are known as the “Go sek kay”\r\n(Wu ship kia), or “Shippay kay,” or “Sessio no eeyay,” helper of\r\nemperor--lit., to take the handle--“the five assisting families.” They\r\nare: 1, Konoyay; 2, Koojio; 3, Nijio; 4, Itchijio; 5, Takatskasa. If\r\nthe highest offices under the Emperor (as those of “Dai jio dai jin,”\r\n“Kwanbakku,” or “Sessio”) be vacant, no one who is not of one of these\r\nfive families is eligible to fill such office.\r\n\r\nIn regard to rank at court, the Koongays generally stand in the lower\r\nclass of the first, or in the second or third rank. They are known at\r\nMiako by their dress. For a long time past they have had little power,\r\nand were of little importance; but since the commencement of foreign\r\nrelations the political tide has rather flowed toward Miako, and\r\nfrom Yedo, and they have increased in political power as well as in\r\nwealth, as the Daimios and office-seekers of Yedo endeavor to obtain\r\nthe objects of their ambition through the influence of their poorer\r\nbrethren in Miako. The poverty of most of the class prevents their\r\nentering upon an enervating life of dissipation, which too often saps\r\nthe vigor of the constitution of the Daimios, and they are able to take\r\na part in the discussion of political subjects. Many of them fill the\r\nmore or less nominal offices of government in one of the eight great\r\nboards of the empire; and this amount of occupation, together with\r\nwriting imaginative pieces, keeps their minds in a sufficient state of\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the distinctions of rank in Japan, there is also the\r\ndistinction into families or clans, great importance being attached to\r\na family name. The feuds between rival families have in past times rent\r\nthe empire to pieces. The Emperor is said to have no name; but some of\r\nthe cadets, offshoots from the imperial line, have founded lines of\r\ntheir own, taking root and flourishing as distinct families. In this\r\nway have been derived the lines known as the “Say wa Genji,” the “Ooda\r\nGenji,” and the “Murakami Genji.” These are descendants of younger sons\r\nof emperors of these names. But among all the families of Japan, the\r\nfirst place is held by that of Fusiwara, in length of pedigree, in the\r\nhonors held in past ages, and in the present position of the family.\r\nDuring every period in the annals of the empire, members of this family\r\nhave filled the highest offices, civil and military, of the state.\r\nBut it has, perhaps, shone more in civil employment than in military.\r\nThe “five families” of the Sekkay mentioned above belong to the clan\r\nFusiwara. Other families have risen at different times to the highest\r\npinnacle attainable by subjects, but after a time they have gradually\r\nfallen back into comparative obscurity. Ninety-five of the Koongays\r\ncall themselves of the clan Fusiwara. In very remote periods the family\r\nof Nakatomi seems to have held the highest rank, absorbing by its\r\nmembers, at one time, all the offices of religion. Only one Koongay\r\nfamily, Fusinami, now represents this old clan. In point of antiquity,\r\nif not of luster of name, the Sungawara family, commonly called Kwang\r\nkay, ranks second only to Fusiwara. The members of this family are\r\nrarely found in military employment, generally filling the offices of\r\nteachers or lecturers on history or religion.\r\n\r\nThe “Gen kay,” otherwise called “Minnamoto,” are more illustrious as\r\nmilitary men. Seventeen families of the Koongays belong to this clan.\r\nAll the Minnamoto Koongays are descended from younger sons of former\r\nemperors. One of these, the “Say wa” Minnamoto, assert that their line\r\nis the same as that of the present imperial dynasty of China, who are\r\ndescendants of the Emperor Say wa, or “Tsing wa,” whence the “Tsing”\r\nor “Ta Tsing” family, which emigrated from the north of Japan several\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\nThe Taira, or He kay, the great opponent of the Gen kay (otherwise\r\nknown as Heji and Genji) during many years of civil war, includes five\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nNishika koji, of the Tanba clan, is said to represent one of the\r\nemperors of China of the Eastern Han dynasty, who was driven from China\r\nand took refuge in Japan.\r\n\r\nA new creation of Koongays is very rare. About 1830, Kitta koji (of the\r\nclan Oway), whose family for three generations had filled the office of\r\nKurodo, was elevated to the rank.\r\n\r\nThe names of Koongays are, in many cases, derived from the street or\r\nplace where they originally lived, as Itchi jio, No. 1 Street.\r\n\r\nThere are in all 137 Koongays.\r\n\r\nThere is assigned to each Koongay an annual revenue calculated in\r\nkoku of rice. This, in most cases, implies so much ground held of the\r\nEmperor. The total sum divided among these noble families does not\r\namount to that allowed to a third-rate Daimio. But though several of\r\nthese nobles are miserably poor, and have probably little to live upon\r\nbesides the rice which is given them by the Emperor, there are some\r\namong them who have other sources of wealth. In old times the Koongays\r\npossessed large landed property; but in the wars of the He kay and Gen\r\nkay, Kiomori, the leader of the former, despoiled them, and the divided\r\nportions of these lands were seized by whoever had the power. Some\r\nstill retain extensive landed property, but the majority have fixed\r\nsalaries, which they receive at the Emperor’s hands. Residing near\r\nthe court, and often connected with the Emperor and high officers by\r\nmarriage, the poorest may possess some influence, and this frequently\r\ncontributes to swell their incomes. This influence is courted by the\r\nDaimios at a distance, who, aspiring to rank or titles, purchase the\r\nassistance and influence of the Koongays, such as it may be, by solid\r\npresents. The higher class, who really have much power, in this way\r\nbecome very rich. The little land which belongs to them may, by taxes,\r\nduties, or customs, produce much more than the exact number of koku\r\nof the original calculation. Thus the seaport town of Itami stands\r\non the ground of Konoyay dono, and he levies a tax upon the exports\r\nand imports; and, in addition to the customs, he receives the duties\r\nupon all the saki or spirit distilled between the towns of Hiogo and\r\nOsaka, and this is the great distilling district for the whole country.\r\nHaving acquired money, he lends it out at Oriental rates of interest\r\nto the Daimios, who are too often in need of ready money, so that he\r\nis a very wealthy man. The Koongays have not the large expenses which\r\ndrain the purses of the Daimios; having comparatively few retainers,\r\nthey are not obliged to make the ostentatious display which brings the\r\nDaimios to poverty; nor have they the same number of establishments to\r\nkeep up at different places. All this contributes to make the upper\r\nclass of Koongays, already powerful by rank, position and influence,\r\nsubstantial in their independence. The poorer class eke out their\r\nexistence in a variety of ways, honorable enough, but not contributing\r\nmuch in the way of worldly wealth. Assukayee teaches playing at “mari,”\r\na sort of football, which is a fashionable game at court, and which\r\nis probably derived from the Chinese shuttlecock, varied according\r\nto the difference in the style of boots and shoes. In playing at this\r\ngame in Miako, the court turns out in gorgeous dresses. Jimio-in and\r\nothers teach writing. Sono dono teaches the science of dwarfing trees\r\nand the art of arranging flowers in flower-holders. At both of these\r\nthe Japanese excel. In the former they display a wonderful power\r\nover nature, and in the latter a highly cultivated taste. A fir-tree\r\nhas been seen in perfect vigor, bearing a cone, and eight years old,\r\nand only an inch in height. Rayzay teaches poetry and composition.\r\nSijio dono teaches the art of dressing dinners and cookery, which is\r\nconsidered in Japan the occupation of a gentleman. When an artist has\r\nprepared a dinner, and laid it out, it is common for the public to go\r\nto see it as a work of art. Yamashima and Takakura superintend and\r\nteach the art of dressing and of etiquette. Tsutchi Mikado teaches\r\nand explains what is known in China as the “Ta kih,” the ultimate\r\ncause of things, the immaterial principle of the Chinese philosophers,\r\nas contained in and exemplified by a series of diagrams; and, as an\r\nastrologer, divines into futurity. Others paint, and sell their works\r\nof art, or teach painting. The poorer individuals who receive rice\r\nalso get the Emperor’s cast-off outer garments. Their daughters are\r\nin the habit of going to the families of the Daimios as governesses\r\n(and are commonly known by the name of “jorosama”), to teach the young\r\nladies and gentlemen the customs and language of the court. Of these\r\nladies there are generally one or more at the residence of the Shiogoon\r\nin Yedo. They sometimes act in the capacity of spies as well as of\r\ngovernesses; and, having much influence, they are sometimes feared as\r\n_censores morum_.\r\n\r\nUnder the five Go sekkay nearly all the Koongays are classed into five\r\ndivisions; and in his relation to his head, each Koongay is known as\r\n“Monrio” or “Sorio”--one division under each of the five.\r\n\r\nIf any of those in a position of Monrio have any business with the\r\ncourt, such must be dispatched through his head, who then communicates\r\nwith the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the Sin wo and sons of the imperial families are\r\nprovided for by absorption into the higher offices of the priesthood,\r\nand to fill the seats in, and receive the revenues of, the richer\r\nabbeys and monasteries. In a similar way the sons of the Go sekkay and\r\nhigher Koongays (known as Kindatchi) are provided for. There are six\r\nrichly-endowed temples whose revenues are respectively enjoyed by a\r\nmember of one of these families. These men are known by the name of\r\n“Sekkay Monzekke.”\r\n\r\nIf a Daimio happens to meet the norimono or sedan-chair of a Koongay\r\nupon the highroad, he must wait with all his retinue till the latter\r\nshall have passed. Koongays usually blacken their teeth and shave the\r\neyebrows, and do not follow the usual custom in shaving the head.\r\nCivilians do not carry a sword; military carry one called “tatchi.”\r\nIn ordinary times a Koongay is not likely to be put to death, however\r\ngreat may be his crimes; but he may be ordered to shave his head and\r\nenter a monastery, or may be confined to a room in his own house.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to ascertain what was the exact position of the Koongays\r\nin the times before the great civil wars of the thirteenth and\r\nfollowing centuries. The empire seems to have been divided at that time\r\nvery much as it is now, into one large central court at the metropolis,\r\nwith a number of smaller courts in the provinces, each ruled by its\r\nlord, king, Daimio, or dynasta, as they have been called. The court\r\nof the Emperor always remained at Miako. There he was surrounded by\r\nthe members of the old families, among whom he distributed honors.\r\nThere was to be seen a supposed prefect form of government, the\r\nhistory of which is written in the “Annals.” Probably in each of the\r\nlesser courts--such, for instance, as that of Satsuma, Mowori, and\r\nother wealthy lords--the same form of government was carried on in\r\na miniature scale; and, so far as can be gathered from history and\r\nnative historical maps, the extensive territories belonging to these\r\nlords were always under the entire rule each of its own master, and\r\nacknowledging no right in the central court (so long as that master did\r\nnot in any way come into collision with the general good of the empire)\r\nto interfere in any way with what passed within these territories. The\r\nimperial court, in its executive form, was confined to the provinces\r\naround Miako--the Gokinai. The annals of the Emperors are devoted in\r\nthe main to the occurrences which took place within these provinces,\r\ndetailing the names and families, the titles, ranks, and history of the\r\nmen who in that court were looked upon as great and eminent. Of these,\r\nthe more prominent were brought forward and advanced by the Emperor in\r\nhereditary rank and title above their fellows--these were the Koongays;\r\nwhile the territorial lords were only known by their family names, or\r\nthe name of the provinces over which they ruled, and were only expected\r\nto come once a year to Miako, in order to pay their respects to the\r\nEmperor. It is not to be expected but that differences would arise\r\namong these territorial lords, some more or less powerful; ambition and\r\nlust of wealth or power would soon find a cause for a quarrel, and this\r\nwould light up a civil war. In such cases, the Emperor and the officers\r\nof the imperial court were looked to as the arbiters or umpires, and\r\nacquired and retained so firm a position in the machinery of the State\r\nand in the minds of the people as to withstand all the shocks which\r\nhave at different times so frequently and rudely put one down and set\r\nup another of these provincial powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHT BOARDS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving given above a sketch of the ranks eligible in old times to fill\r\nthe offices of government, a step will be gained by obtaining some\r\ninsight into the means by which that government was carried on. The\r\narrangements are of very ancient date, and seem to have been more or\r\nless in actual use until the separation of the empire into two at the\r\nend of the sixteenth century. At that time the executive department of\r\nthe empire was entirely removed to Yedo, but the shadow or the skeleton\r\nof the defunct body was allowed to remain in Miako. The offices which\r\nhad of old conferred power, and demanded exertion in fulfilling the\r\nduties, were now only empty names--honorific appellations; the power of\r\nconferring these nominal offices being all that remained to the Emperor\r\nof his former greatness. Still the retention of the power has not been\r\nwithout its use. Though the actual power has been in the hands of the\r\nShiogoon, the hopes of the people and of the Emperor have ever turned\r\ntoward its ultimate re-establishment at Miako, in a machinery all ready\r\nat any moment to take up the duties of government.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the government of Japan was settled, many of the\r\ninstitutions of China seem to have been copied or transferred by\r\nthe founders of the empire. This must have occurred at a very early\r\nperiod in its history. While the original model has been followed,\r\nmodifications have from time to time been introduced to meet the\r\nvarying exigencies of the country. But perhaps nothing points more\r\nstrongly to a Chinese origin for the ruling ranks of Japan than the\r\nearly adoption of this form of government. As in China six boards are\r\nfound at Pekin, so in Japan eight boards are found at Miako. The names\r\nof these boards or departments, the titles of the officials, the ranks\r\nof the subordinate officers, are all found under Chinese names.\r\n\r\nKlaproth has given in his “Annals of the Emperors” a sketch of these\r\neight boards, with the offices under each. It is probably taken from\r\nthe “Shoku gen sho,” a little work written in the year 1340 by Kitta\r\nBatake Chikafusa, and in use at the present day as a concise account of\r\nthe government of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe study of such a subject is rather dry and uninteresting, but it\r\nis necessary for any one who wishes to make himself acquainted with\r\nJapanese history, either of the past or of the present day, to read\r\nand understand this book. What here follows is only a rough sketch\r\nwith a little further filling in. In what may be called the preface\r\nto the “Shoku gen sho”--a slight historical introduction--the author\r\nsays: “We gather from old records, that in the time of Sui ko (the\r\nfirst Empress), in the twelfth year of her reign, A.D. 605, Sho toku,\r\nbeing prime minister, settled twelve grades of officers. Afterward, the\r\nEmperor Kwo toku, in the fifth year of his reign (A.D. 650), divided\r\nthe country into eight provinces (or divided the government into\r\neight departments), and definitely fixed the offices. Subsequently,\r\nin the first year of the Emperor Mun moo (A.D. 697), Fusiwara no tan\r\nkaiko Kamatariko (canonized as Kassunga dia mio jin) was appointed\r\ngreat minister, and by him laws were made and the officers and nobles\r\nwere appointed. At one time the numbers were greatly diminished, and\r\nagain they were increased, and fresh officers, ‘uncommissioned,’ got\r\nemployment. But the ministers, the ‘Nai dai jin’ and the ‘Chiu nagoon,’\r\nexisted before the first year of Mun moo. But authentic records of that\r\nperiod do not remain in existence at the present time. In old times\r\nthere was a separate office of religion known as the ‘Jin ngi kwang’\r\nor ‘Kami no tskasa,’ answering to the ‘Ta chang sz’ in China. The two\r\nofficers who superintended the rites in worship of the gods were above\r\nall other officers. This was the pristine custom in the kingdom of\r\nspirits (Japan), arising from the reverence paid to the gods of heaven\r\nand the spirits of earth.\r\n\r\n“In the earliest times the Emperor Zinmu established the capital within\r\nthe bounds of the province of Yamato, at Kashiwarra. At that time, in\r\nthe beginning, Ten shio dai shin (the heaven-illuminating spirit) came\r\ndown and placed three things--a ball or seal, an eight-cubit mirror,\r\nand a grass-shaving sword--in the palace, on the throne of the Emperor,\r\nwhich received homage such as was offered in early times. The efficacy\r\nof the spirit was great, so that the Emperor dwelling with the spirit\r\nwas, as it were, equal to a god. Within the palace these three emblems\r\nwere placed in safety, that it might be said that where these are there\r\nis divine power. At this time two high officers, ‘Ama no koya ne no\r\nmikoto’ and ‘Ama no tane ko mikoto,’ regulated the sacrificial rites\r\nand court ceremonies, until the time of the Emperor Soui-zin (97-30\r\nB.C.), who, fearing the majesty of the divinity, took away these three\r\nefficacious symbols, the sword and the seal and the mirror, and put\r\nthem elsewhere (_i.e._, in a palace he built at Miako); which was the\r\norigin of the idea of the Emperor’s sitting like a god in the place of\r\na god.\r\n\r\n“In the reign of Swee nin (A.D. 29-70) the great spirit Tenshio, or Ten\r\nshio dai jin, descended upon the province of Isse (when the Emperor\r\nmeasured and divided that province), and that Emperor built and endowed\r\nthe temple or yashiro of Isse. This is the most sacred temple in the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n“At that time the O nakatomi family were hereditary officers of\r\nreligion, and of rites of worship.\r\n\r\n“After the officers of state had been appointed, the officers of the\r\nJin ngi kwang, or spiritual department, were settled. Originally the\r\nJin ngi kwang was the highest department of all. The temple built by\r\nthe Emperor at Isse had separate officers of worship, and as to duties,\r\nboth regulated worship; the offices were similar in their origin\r\nand character, but the department of religion was of the highest\r\nimportance. Therefore, in the kingdom of spirits (_i.e._, Japan) these\r\nofficers of religion ranked above all other officers. At that time\r\na man of the fourth rank could be an officer of religion, but now\r\nit is confined to the second and third ranks. Formerly, any one was\r\nconsidered capable of filling the office, Nakatomi or other; but in\r\nthe middle ages, since the time of the Emperor Kwa sann, it became\r\nhereditary in the family of his son, and no other family could fill the\r\noffice; and it has since been filled by the members of the royal family.\r\n\r\n“Originally the name Nakatomi designated an office. When one of the\r\nholders was made Oodai jin, he added O (great) to his title; but his\r\ndescendants did not use the title, therefore they are simply called\r\nNakatomi.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the introduction to the “Book of the Government of the Empire.”\r\nWhat follows is the names of the different offices, and ranks of\r\nofficers, whether civil or military, stating what rank is eligible to\r\nhold each office, what offices can be held in conjunction by the same\r\nperson, together with the Chinese equivalent of each title wherever it\r\ncan be given.\r\n\r\nEvery office in Japan is divided into four--a head and three\r\nsubordinates. The head is called by various titles, Kio, Kami, Tayu,\r\nDaiboo, etc. The highest subordinate is called Skay or Ske--in Chinese,\r\nTsu--to assist or help; or Kai, to attend upon; also Tso, to assist:\r\nall three characters are used. The next is Jo--Chinese, Shing, to\r\nassist--deputy. The clerks are called Sakkan--Chinese, Shuh--attached\r\nto as a tail, dependent on. Each of these may be subdivided into great\r\nand small, Dai and Sho; and further, frequently into sa and oo--_i.e._,\r\nleft and right. Besides these official grades, the title of Gong, or\r\nGonno, is found. This seems to be an honorific title, and is generally\r\nconferred by the Emperor upon Koongays and persons about his own\r\ncourt. It seems to mean honorary substitute or deputy, and is added or\r\nprefixed to another title. This is the word K’ün in Chinese, with the\r\nmeaning of power, balance, temporary substitute.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations it may be possible to understand the titles and\r\ndescriptions of offices and officers given in the Shoku gen sho.\r\n\r\nThe first or highest office was that of religion, or board of rites,\r\nthe Jin ngi kwang (shin k’i kwan), the office of the worship of\r\nspirits. This office, at first entirely for regulation of the Sinto\r\nreligion, was rendered unnecessary by the introduction of Buddhism,\r\nand has been practically done away with--the higher titles and larger\r\nemoluments being absorbed by the younger sons of royal families, while\r\nthe working part of the board has been joined with the highest board,\r\nDai jo gwang.\r\n\r\nThe Dai jo gwang, or Matsuri koto tskasa, is the great office of\r\ngovernment. This is the “cabinet,” and is over and superintends the\r\neight boards and the affairs of the whole empire. The chief of the\r\ndepartment is the Dai jo dai jin--the great minister of the whole\r\ngovernment. He is also called Sho koku. This office is not always\r\nfilled up. The holder is in settled times nearly invariably one of\r\nthe “five families.” This is the highest office in the state, and was\r\ncommenced by the Emperor Ten shi, who conferred it on his son. When\r\nthis office is vacant, the next in rank, the Sa dai jin (left great\r\nminister) is highest official in point of rank. The highest subject\r\ngenerally receives at the Emperor’s hands the title of Kwanbakku, first\r\ngiven A.D. 880. The Kwanbakku is always near the Emperor’s person, and\r\nnot engaged so much as others on public business. If the sovereign be\r\na minor or a female, a regent is appointed, who is naturally the most\r\npowerful subject in the empire. He is named Sessio, or Setz jio, helper\r\nof the government. When such a regent is appointed for a young Empress,\r\nit is generally intended that he is to marry her, and become Emperor.\r\nThe Kwanbakku was, in old times, called Omurazi. He is frequently\r\nspoken of as Denga sama. The Dai jo dai jin is commonly known as Sho\r\nkoku, the Sa dai jin as Sa foo sama, Oo dai jin as Eoo foo sama, Nai\r\ndai dai jin as Nai or Dai foo sama. There may be only one of the three\r\ntitles, Dai jio dai jin, Kwanbakku, or Sessio, conferred at a time;\r\nbut whoever holds it is known to be the highest official, and he may\r\nhave all three titles at the same time. The office of Dai jio dai jin\r\nhas frequently remained vacant for lengthened periods.\r\n\r\nIn the Dai jio gwang there are four ministers. Dai jin means great\r\nminister, and the prefix of Sa is left, of Oo is right. In Japan the\r\nleft generally takes precedence. And these four stand in this relation\r\nto one another. The first three are known as the “Sanko,” or three\r\nexalted ones. There is another officer, that of Nai dai jin, inner or\r\nmiddle great minister. This office is filled up if there be no Dai jio\r\ndai jin; but if otherwise it remains in abeyance.\r\n\r\nSince 1780 the Shiogoon has generally been elevated to be Oodai jin or\r\nSadai jin.\r\n\r\nThe next officer below the Oodai jin is the Dai na goon. There are ten\r\nof them. They act with the Sanko in the Dai jo gwang office. They seem\r\nto be the mouthpieces to and from the board, and in consultation with\r\nthe board. They are generally Koongays. But some of the highest Daimios\r\nare competent for the office, Owarri, Kishiu, and Mito.\r\n\r\nThe Chiu (or middle) na goon--ten officers of much lower rank than\r\nthe last--never deliberate with the board, but are consulted after or\r\nbefore. They are generally Koongays.\r\n\r\nThe Sangi (Ts’an i), also called Sei sho and Gisso (I tsau), is a very\r\nimportant office--eight officers. They are of high rank (above the\r\nlast), and are chosen for their talent for the office. This seems to be\r\nto report upon the proceedings and conclusions of the other officers of\r\nthe board; to watch and also advise, and sometimes to act as judges.\r\nThey are both civil and military. If a man has shown himself qualified\r\nfor this office he may rise to it, though not originally of high rank.\r\n\r\nThe Sho (or lesser) nagoon are much below the above officers in rank.\r\nThey are said to help the memories of the principal officers, to put\r\nseals to deeds, and carry communications to other boards: they are both\r\nmilitary and civil.\r\n\r\nGayki or Kwanmu--five officers who act as secretaries to one of the\r\nthree officers of the Dai jo ngwang. Divided into great and small, Dai\r\nand Sho, gayki; the head man is called Kioo ku mu. The duties consist\r\nin writing out the patents and titles conferred by the Mikado. In cases\r\nof dispute between high officers, they seem to write out a statement of\r\nthe case on both sides for the decision of the board. They look after\r\nany newly-introduced business, such as introduction of foreigners to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBen-gwang, seven officers, all Koongay--a higher office than the\r\npreceding. Two head men, left and right, Sa and Oo dai ben. This is a\r\nvery responsible office; all the business of the board passes through\r\nthe hands of the officers. They superintend and set apart to each of\r\nthe minor offices their business.\r\n\r\nSa chiu ben and Oo chiu ben, two men.\r\n\r\nSa sho ben and Oo sho ben, two men.\r\n\r\nThese are subordinates in the office, but men of rank.\r\n\r\nGonno ben. This is an honorific title, giving high rank, but having no\r\nbusiness or duties to perform.\r\n\r\nThe Ben-gwang officers are always in their handsome official dress, and\r\nare at once recognizable on the street.\r\n\r\nShi, eight men. Their business is to act as bookkeepers or registrars\r\nof the transactions of the board; they take charge of the books, and\r\nare referred to for information of past transactions.\r\n\r\nSa and Oo dai shi, four men.\r\n\r\nSi sho, twenty men, attendants of the three high officers.\r\n\r\nKwa jo, four men, attendants of the Ben-gwang. Though low, the office\r\nis an important one.\r\n\r\n\r\nHATCH SHIO, THE EIGHT BOARDS\r\n\r\nThe eight boards under the Dai jo gwang are:\r\n\r\n  1. Nakatskasa no sho.\r\n  2. Siki bu sho (Ch., Li po).\r\n  3. Ji bu sho (Ch., Li po).\r\n  4. Min bu sho (Ch., U po).\r\n  5. Hio bu sho (Ch., Ping po).\r\n  6. Gio bu sho (Ch., Ying po).\r\n  7. Okura no sho (Ch., Ta fu sz).\r\n  8. Koo nai sho (Ch., Kung po).\r\n\r\nI. Nakatskasa no sho, or Naka no matsuri koto suru tskasa (equivalent\r\noffice in China, Chang shu shang).--The Board of the Interior\r\nGovernment, superintends the palace and the affairs of the Emperor, and\r\nregulates the imperial household.\r\n\r\nThe head man, Nakatskasa no kio, is always of very high rank--generally\r\na son of the Emperor, or of one of the royal families.\r\n\r\nNakatskasa no ta yu, chamberlain of the household.\r\n\r\nNakatskasa no gonno tayu is always a Mayka no tenjio bito koongay.\r\n\r\nNakatskasa no shoyu.\r\n\r\nNakatskasa no gonno shoyu.\r\n\r\nNakatskasa no dai and sho jio, subordinates of the above.\r\n\r\nNakatskasa no dai and sho sakkan, secretaries.\r\n\r\nDji jiu, eight men of high rank.\r\n\r\nWo do neri, ninety men of low rank; clean rooms, etc.\r\n\r\nNeiki, writers to the Emperor’s dictation, or for his perusal on\r\ngovernment business; correspond about conferring rank, and write out\r\ndocuments connected with this. They are always able men, and any man\r\nmay rise to fill this office if he shows talent.\r\n\r\nDai neiki, one man; sho neiki, two men; the latter subordinates and\r\nsuccessors of the former.\r\n\r\nKemmootz, Dai and Sho, two men.\r\n\r\nThese are the reporters or spies (ometskys) upon the officers of the\r\nwhole board--literally, lookers into things (kien wuh).\r\n\r\nSho den, one man of low rank to superintend the servants and to see\r\nthat rooms are cleaned, etc.\r\n\r\nKangee no tskasa, keepers of the keys, now done away with.\r\n\r\nIncluded under this department are the establishments of the Emperor’s\r\ngrandmother, mother, and wife. These are called the Shi ngoo--four\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe office of the Emperor’s grandmother is Tai kwo tai kowu goo siki,\r\nthe great Emperor’s great Empress’s office.\r\n\r\nThat of the mother, Kwo tai kowu goo siki.\r\n\r\nThat of the wife having a child, Kwo tai kowu goo siki.\r\n\r\nThat of the wife before she has a child, Chiu ngoo siki.\r\n\r\nThe ladies rank as Dai nagoon.\r\n\r\nUnder the Nakatskasa no shio there are several minor hoards or rio.\r\n\r\nO do neri no rio.--In this office there were formerly 800 men about the\r\ncourt, as messengers, servants, etc.\r\n\r\nOdoneri no kami, Ske, etc.\r\n\r\nDsu sho rio, surveying office for plans of houses, maps of towns,\r\ncountry, harbors, seas, etc.\r\n\r\nDsu sho no kami, Ske, etc.\r\n\r\nKoora rio, storehouse officer, has charge of the valuables belonging to\r\nthe palace--a responsible office.\r\n\r\nOfficers--Koora no kami, K. no gonno kami, K. no ske, etc.\r\n\r\nNoo ee rio superintends the making of the clothes and sewing generally\r\nof the palace.\r\n\r\nNoo ee no kami, N. no ske, N. no gonno ske, etc.\r\n\r\nOng yo rio (literally, clear obscure office), department of\r\nastrology--composer of the almanac--observers of the heavens.\r\n\r\nOng yo no kami, O. no ske, etc. Ong yo no haka se and Gonno haka se,\r\nteacher of astrology.\r\n\r\nRayki haka se, composer of the almanac and teacher.\r\n\r\nTen mong haka se, astronomer-royal.\r\n\r\nRo koku haka se, keeper of time by the clepsydra; teacher of\r\ntime-keeping.\r\n\r\nTaku mi rio, office of the carpenters, woodworkers. Taku mi no kami,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nPalaces, temples, houses and bridges in Japan being, for fear of\r\nearthquakes, nearly entirely built of wood, the trade of carpenter\r\nrises to a science, and, including architecture and engineering, is a\r\nbusiness or profession which is held in high respect.\r\n\r\nIn the official list mention is not made of the head man of the tanner\r\nclass, or that which deals in skins of dead animals, which occupation\r\nis an abomination to the pure Buddhist. The name of the class is\r\nYayta. They live in Yayta mura or village of skinners, often called\r\nYakunin mura. The head man is Kobowozi. His duty is to go every day to\r\nthe palace and clear away all dead animals--rats, mice, birds. He wears\r\ntwo swords and is generally handsomely dressed. The class belongs to\r\nthe Ikkoshiu sect of Buddhists. Some of the men following this trade\r\nare very rich. Teikoya in Osaka and Siroyama in Yedo are both wealthy.\r\nThe head skinner of the “eight provinces,” Danza yay mong, claims to\r\nbe descended from Yoritomo. He also is reputed to be very wealthy,\r\nexercising great power over his own trade, which is governed by its\r\nown laws. Living in a fine house near the Yosiwara in Yedo, he is a\r\ndespotic ruler, and can punish with death those under him. His private\r\nchapel or Bootzu dang is said to be the finest in Yedo.\r\n\r\nII. Siki bu shio (Chinese, Shik po shang; Chinese equivalent office, Li\r\npo), the Board of Civil Office. Has legislative functions, and under\r\nthis board is the department of public instruction and the college. The\r\nhead man of the board is the Siki bu kio. He is generally a Sinwo, or\r\na member of the imperial family. If the Kio be an able, energetic man,\r\nhis position enables him to obtain great power, and he may become the\r\nfirst man in the empire. Formerly, men known by the name Si sho were\r\nsent by the board to all the provinces to report on the government of\r\neach. They were changed every four years, but the custom has become\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\nSiki bu no Tayu.\r\n\r\nSiki bu no Gonno Tayu, both men of high rank, who practically carry on\r\nthe business of the board.\r\n\r\nSiki bu no Sho yu and Gonno sho yu, etc.\r\n\r\nUnder this board is the Dai gaku rio (Ch. equivalent, Kwoh tsz kien),\r\noffice of instruction or education. The head man is Dai gaku no kami.\r\nThis office is divided into four sub-classes, which have to do with the\r\ninstruction conveyed in books and literature to the people.\r\n\r\n1. Ray ki shi, history, including the history of China and Japan and a\r\nlittle of India and Ceylon, as Buddhist countries.\r\n\r\n2. Migio, religion--originally Sinto religion only.\r\n\r\n3. Mio bo, laws and jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n4.

This board deals with the\r\nforms of society, manners, etiquette, worship, ceremonies for the\r\nliving and the dead, etc.\r\n\r\nJi bu kio, the head officer of the board, of very high rank.\r\n\r\nJi bu no tayu, two men; Ji bu no gonno tayu, two men, etc.\r\n\r\nOota rio (Ch., Ya yoh), a department of the board--superintends music\r\nand poetry in all its branches.\r\n\r\nOota no kami, etc.\r\n\r\nGengba rio is another department, called also O shi maro wo dono: takes\r\ncharge of embassies from outer countries--Corea, China, and India;\r\nlooks after Buddhism. All business connected with foreign countries\r\ncomes within the scope of this office.\r\n\r\nGenba no kami, head officer, Ske, etc.\r\n\r\nMisasaki rio, an officer to look after the tombs of the Emperors.\r\n\r\nMisasaki no kami is head officer.\r\n\r\nIV. Min bu sho (Chinese, Min po shang)--Chin. office, Upo,\r\nboard of population and revenue. Tame no tskasa, board of the\r\npopulation--states, provinces, land, houses, census. In this office is\r\nkept a book or register for the registration of all deeds connected\r\nwith land and landed property, surveys, and statistics of the empire.\r\nThe book is called “Min bu shio no dzu sho.”\r\n\r\nMin bu kio, head officer, of high rank.\r\n\r\nMin bu no Tayu.[2] M. Gonno Tayu.\r\n\r\nMin bu no sho, etc.\r\n\r\nKadzuye rio, the office for taxes paid in money. Officers--Kami, Ske,\r\njo, and sakkan.\r\n\r\nSan shi, office for money taken in country places only.\r\n\r\nChikara rio, somewhat similar to the above; taxes paid in kind, rice,\r\netc. The office is now merged in the Kadzuye rio.\r\n\r\nV. Hio bu sho (Chinese office, Ping po), Board of War--war-office. This\r\nis the most important department.\r\n\r\nHio bu kioh the head officer, is sometimes of the imperial blood.\r\n\r\nHio bu no tayu. H. no Gonno tayu, sho, etc.\r\n\r\nHyato no tskasa, seems to be a sort of police in case of war. Hyato no\r\nkami, ske, and sakkan.\r\n\r\nVI. Gio bu shio (Chinese office, Ying po), board of punishments. The\r\nname is changed to Ke be ishi, which includes the criminal courts, with\r\nthe machinery necessary to their working, but the titles remain.\r\n\r\nGio bu Kioh, head of the office.\r\n\r\nGio bu Tayu, Gonno tayu, sho, etc.\r\n\r\nDai ban ji, the first judge.\r\n\r\nThis officer is the judge of civil and criminal cases. There are no\r\nbarristers or advocates used in the law courts of Japan. Each man\r\nstates his own case.\r\n\r\nShiu goku ji--prison department.\r\n\r\nShiu goku no kami, ske, etc.\r\n\r\nAs this title is supposed to convey some disgrace with it, no one\r\nconsiders it an honor, and therefore it is generally combined with some\r\nother.\r\n\r\nVII. Okura no shio (Chinese office, Tafu sz), officer over the imperial\r\nstorehouses and granaries.\r\n\r\nO kura kio is an officer of high rank.\r\n\r\nO kura no tayu, O kura no Gonno tayu, etc.\r\n\r\nOri be no tskasa, weavers of the imperial silks.\r\n\r\nOri be no kami, etc.\r\n\r\nVIII. Koo nai shio, the board of the interior of the palace; was\r\nformerly a department of the Naka tskasa shio. Superintends the\r\nfurniture, food, pathways, etc.\r\n\r\nKoo nai kio, first officer, of high rank.\r\n\r\nKoo nai no tayu, and Gonno tayu.\r\n\r\nKoo nai no sho and Gonno sho, all of high rank.\r\n\r\nKoo no dai jo and sho jo, etc.\r\n\r\nDai zen siki, purveyor to the Emperor’s guests.\r\n\r\nDai zen no daibu, first officer. The Prince of Nagato, Matzdaira Daizen\r\nno daibu, holds this office.\r\n\r\nDai zen no Gonno daibu, of high rank.\r\n\r\nDai zen no ske and Gonno ske.\r\n\r\nThis was formerly the highest ske at court.\r\n\r\nMokoo rio, officer of carpentry and woodwork about the palace.\r\n\r\nMokoo no kami, high rank.\r\n\r\nMokoo no Gonno kami, etc.\r\n\r\nSan shi, bookkeepers.\r\n\r\nOee rio, purveyor of food for the gods of the palace.\r\n\r\nOee no kami, one man. This is said to be a lucrative office; probably\r\nmuch is provided and little consumed.\r\n\r\nOee no ske and Gonno ske, etc.\r\n\r\nTonomo rio, department for superintending the cleaning of the palace.\r\n\r\nT. no kami, etc.\r\n\r\nTen yaku rio--medical department--two apothecaries, medical attendants\r\nupon the Emperor, etc.\r\n\r\nTen yaku no kami, etc.\r\n\r\nEe no haka se, teachers of medicine.\r\n\r\nNio yee haka se, teachers of diseases of women.\r\n\r\nShin no haka se, teachers of acupuncture.\r\n\r\nJee yee, one man--Emperor’s personal medical attendant.\r\n\r\nEe shi, similar, but of lower rank.\r\n\r\nKammon rio (Ch., Si sau shü), scavenger department in the palace.\r\n\r\nKammon no kami--the Daimio Ee holds this title. In 1859 this Daimio was\r\nregent under the Shiogoon’s government, and was assassinated in the\r\nstreets of Yedo.\r\n\r\nKammon no ske, etc.\r\n\r\nO Kimi tskasa, chamberlains to the Sinwo or royal families.\r\n\r\nO Kimi no kami is hereditary in the family of Owo.\r\n\r\nNai zen shi, purveyor of provisions for the imperial household.\r\n\r\nNei zen no kami, obsolete.\r\n\r\nBu zen no kami fills the office above.\r\n\r\nTen zen, of low rank.\r\n\r\nMiki tskasa, office for presenting wine to the gods in the palace. Upon\r\nevery household altar in Japan is seen a small bottle of wine.\r\n\r\nMiki no kami, etc.\r\n\r\nOoneme tskasa, overseer of the female officers of the palace, O. no\r\nkami and O. no sakkan.\r\n\r\nMondo no tskasa, superintends the water supplied to the palace, M. no\r\nkami, M. no sakkan.\r\n\r\nThese (the Ooneme and the Mondo) are the two lowest offices in the\r\neight boards. In the offices about the court the subordinate officers\r\nunder the rank of kami are known by the general name of Shi kwang.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the Shoku gen sho relates to the Boo kang, executive\r\nand military departments.\r\n\r\nDan jo dai (Ch., Yu shi t’ai), was formerly at Miako, is now at Yedo.\r\nThe Kebe ishi at Miako seems to be what remains of the office at that\r\nplace. The office has very great power, acting apparently as police of\r\nthe empire, the business being to arrest criminals of all descriptions.\r\nThe office is within the inclosure of the castle at Yedo.\r\n\r\nThe head officer is the Dan jo in. He is of very high rank--sometimes\r\nof one of the royal families, or one of the three highest ministers.\r\n\r\nThe second is Dan jo no dai hitz; below him, D. sho hitz, etc.\r\n\r\nSa kio siki, office of the left half of Miako.\r\n\r\nSa kio no daibu, mayor or governor of high rank--now has but little\r\npower, as the business is transferred to the Kebe ishi office.\r\n\r\nUnder the Sa kio siki is To itchi tskasa, superintendent of the east\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nTo itchi no Kami.\r\n\r\nOo kio siki, office of the right half of Miako; similar to the above.\r\nOo kio no kami, and the office of Sei itchi tskasa, superintendent of\r\nthe west market.\r\n\r\nTo ngoo, office of the heir-apparent, son of Emperor.\r\n\r\nTo ngoo no fu, head of the office.\r\n\r\nTo ngoo no yaku shi, two men, teachers of the prince--are always either\r\nMunjo haka se, or Mio gio haka se, and of the families of Sungawara\r\nor Owe. To ngoo no bo keeps the prince’s accounts. To ngoo no daibu\r\nis always Dai jo dai jin, or Kwanbakku, or son of one of the highest\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nTo ngoo no gonno daibu, etc.\r\n\r\nShuzen Kang, purveyor for the prince. He is always Nei zen no kami to\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\nTo no mo sho, keeper of the chambers of the prince.\r\n\r\nTo ngoo no shunen sho, keeper of the horses of the prince.\r\n\r\nIsse no sei goo rio, or Sei ki no mia no tskasa. This was an old\r\noffice in connection with the Emperor’s daughters, who officiated as\r\npriestesses at Isse. It is now obsolete. In the year 5 B.C. the Emperor\r\nSei Nin established his daughter at Isse as priestess of the temple he\r\nhad built in honor of Ten shio dai jin. He gave her the title of Seigoo\r\nor Sai koo.\r\n\r\nShun siki (Ch., siu li chih), carpenters of the Buddhist temples.\r\n\r\nShuri no daibu. This office is filled by the Daimio of Satsuma,\r\n“Shimadzu shuri no daibu.”\r\n\r\nSh. no gonno daibu, etc.\r\n\r\nKangay yushi. This seems to be a military board of deliberation. Kangay\r\nyu no cho gwang of high rank.\r\n\r\nKangay yu no ji kwang, one man of high rank, generally a Ben gwang.\r\nThis is a very high office; the officers are always known from their\r\nfine dress.\r\n\r\nK. no hang gwang, military secretaries in the office.\r\n\r\nShuzen shi, the Mint.\r\n\r\nThe Mint is not now at Miako, but at Yedo, where the Shiogoon’s\r\nofficers keep it in their own hands.\r\n\r\nShuri goo jo shi, superintendent of Sintoo temples or mias. Head\r\nofficer is always a Ben gwang.\r\n\r\nDzo ji shi, superintendents of Buddhist temples.\r\n\r\nBo wo ngashi, military man, superintends the banks of the Kamongawa, a\r\nriver at Miako. Is at the same time Ta yee no ske.\r\n\r\nSe yaku in, doctors for the poor in Miako.\r\n\r\nKe bi ishi, Police and Executive. The Kangay yu no cho, the Gio bu\r\nshio, and the Kebi ishi, are now merged in one department, to which all\r\nthe Kokushiu Daimios, the Dai jo gwang, Giobushio, the Ometski, and\r\ncity governors belong, and is very important.\r\n\r\nThe head officer is Kebi ishi no bettowo, a military man of higher rank\r\nthan the Sanghi. There is a saying that a Kebi ishi no bettowo should\r\nhave seven virtues. These seven virtues, the book remarks, it is very\r\ndifficult to find in one man. K. no bettowo is one of the men with most\r\npower over the natives in the empire.\r\n\r\nK. no ske, two men. They are commonly known as Ta yee no ske, and every\r\none in Miako can recognize them at once by their dress.\r\n\r\nThen follow the titles of men as heads of some of the large families or\r\nclans of Japan.\r\n\r\nFusi wara ooji no choja (chang shang), the head of the clan Fusiwara.\r\nBy men of this clan all high civil offices are filled. The offices of\r\nSessio and Kwanbakku are filled by members of this family. When the\r\ncountry is torn by civil war, then he who gets the power may take the\r\ntitle, as in the case of Taiko sma and his son.\r\n\r\nGenji no Choja, the head of the family of Gen. Gen and Minnamoto are\r\nthe same name (Ch., un, a spring of water). It is supposed to be\r\npre-eminently military, and having gained the upper hand in the long\r\ncivil wars with the He family, it has advanced in honor, especially\r\nunder the present dynasty of Shiogoons, who call themselves Minnamoto.\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon is Minnamoto no choja, and as holding this title he now is\r\nalso Shiungaku in no bettowo, or principal of the college of Shiungaku\r\nin, formerly in Miako, now in Yedo. He is also head of the college\r\nJoone wa in.\r\n\r\nThen follow some of the officers more immediately about the Emperor’s\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nNai keoo bo no bettowo, office of music for the ladies, generally held\r\nby a man of high rank, with some knowledge of music.\r\n\r\nNai zen no bettowo, examiner or presenter of the Emperor’s food, of\r\nhigh rank.\r\n\r\nMi dzu shi dokoro no bettowo, superintendent of the kitchen in the\r\npalace, is always Kura no kami.\r\n\r\nO oota dokoro no bettowo, superintendent of singing and poetry, an\r\nofficer of very high rank, sometimes one of the royal family.\r\n\r\nKi roku dokoro no bettowo. Every day there meet in the Emperor’s study,\r\nor Ki roku, this officer, who is of Koongio rank, one of the Ben gwang,\r\none Kaiko, and one Yori oodo, who come to write for the Emperor.\r\n\r\nKaku sho no bettowo, superintendent of a certain kind of music (Yoh).\r\n\r\nKuro wu do or Kurodo dokoro, an important department in the palace. The\r\nEmperor Saga, A.D. 810, commenced the office. The officers seem to be\r\nnoble attendants on the Emperor’s person, and to appear about him when\r\nin public.\r\n\r\nKurodo no Bettowo is an office held by one of the highest\r\nministers--Kwanbakku or Sadaijin.\r\n\r\nKurodo no To (or Tono kurodo dokoro), two officers, one Ben gwang, one\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nGo-i (fifth rank) kuro do dokoro, three officers, civilians, always\r\nrise from this to higher rank: first, to Hatch shio no ske, then to\r\nKangay yu no jikang, to Kebe ishi no ske, to Tono Kurodo, and to\r\nSanghi. Therefore this place is sought after by the Kindatchi (sons of\r\nGo sekkay), as it brings them prominently forward; but it is an office\r\nrequiring great energy and exactness, and mistakes are apt to bring the\r\nofficer into trouble. The dress of the K. no To is somewhat similar in\r\ncolor to the Emperor’s.\r\n\r\nRoko-i (sixth rank) no kurodo, four officers. Must be sons of Shodaibu\r\n(fifth rank); must be able and of good courage, and steady men. The\r\nfirst officer gets as his perquisite the kikuji no ho, the used outer\r\nclothes of the Emperor, of yellow and green colors mixed. One of the\r\nlower officers gets the inner white silk dress, which is changed every\r\nday. The Emperor never wears linen or cotton.\r\n\r\nHi kurodo, many, all of low rank, and are the men-servants of the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nKo do neri, lower servants.\r\n\r\nDzo siki, military officers, young men, guards of the kurodo.\r\n\r\nTokoro no shiu, attendants.\r\n\r\nTake ngootchi, private soldiers.\r\n\r\nThen follows another short historical notice of the Sho koku, all the\r\nprovinces of Japan, to the effect that formerly all Japan belonged to\r\nthe Emperor Zin mu, who was, before becoming Emperor, a (kami yoh)\r\ngod. He came from Miazaki in Fiuga, and at the time Japan was wild and\r\nbarbarous. He fought his way to Yamato, and made his capital Kashiwara.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the tenth Emperor, Shiu jin, Kashiwara existed. He\r\nsent embassies to all the separate princes of Japan. He appointed four\r\ngenerals of the north, south, east and west, Si dono shiogoon, and, war\r\nensuing, he conquered all Japan.\r\n\r\nEmperor Say mu, A.D. 150, the thirteenth after Zin mu, appointed rulers\r\nover the country. These were then called “Kooni no miatsko,” and he\r\nsubsequently divided the empire into provinces. These lords were\r\nafterward called “Koku shiu,” and again were known as “Kami to you.”\r\n\r\nThe provinces were divided into--\r\n\r\n  Gay koku, inferior provinces.\r\n  Dai koku, large provinces.\r\n  Jo koku, superior provinces.\r\n  Chiu koku, central provinces.\r\n  Ki nai koku, the five provinces round Miako.\r\n\r\nTo each of these there were appointed officers--kami, jo, ske, and\r\nsakkan.\r\n\r\nThe provinces were classed together as To kai do (eastern sea-road),\r\nfifteen provinces--1, Iga; 2, Isse; 3, Sima; 4, Owarri; 5, Mikawa; 6,\r\nTootomi; 7, Suruga; 8, Idzu; 9, Kahi; 10, Segami; 11, Musasi; 12, Awa;\r\n13, Kadsusa; 14, Simosa; 15, Hitatsi.\r\n\r\nTo sando (eastern Highland), eight provinces--1, Oomi; 2, Mino; 3,\r\nHida; 4, Sinano; 5, Kowodsuki; 6, Simodsuki; 7, Mootz; 8, Dewa.\r\n\r\nDewa and Mootz are large outlying provinces, and one Kami is not\r\nsufficient, therefore another office is established there, “Azetshi no\r\nfoo.” Originally Mootz and Dewa were one. About A.D. 713, in the time\r\nof the Empress Gen mei, Mootz was divided; and the Empress Gen Sio,\r\nwho succeeded, created the office of Azetshi shi; and the Emperor Sio\r\nmu added Chinji foo and Fooku shio goong, and Goon king and Goon so.\r\nAzetshi shi is the chief officer of Mootz, and is of high rank.\r\n\r\nAzetshi shi no keji, his secretary.\r\n\r\nChin ji foo is another officer in these provinces, of which the head\r\nofficer is named Chin no shiogoong. The Diamio known as “Sendai” is\r\nthe head man of these provinces, and, as Kami of Mootz, is known also\r\nas Fooku shiogoong.\r\n\r\nIn these provinces are the two officers Akita no jo and Ske. The\r\nEmperor Sio mu built a fortress at Akita, and appointed an officer in\r\ncharge. Dewa no ske and Akita no ske are different titles of the same\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nHoku roku do, north-country provinces route. Seven provinces--1,\r\nWakasa; 2, Etsizen; 3, Kanga; 4, Noto; 5, Etjiu; 6, Etsingo; 7, Sado.\r\n\r\nSan in do. The back or north Highland route. Eight provinces--1, Tamba;\r\n2, Tango; 3, Tajima; 4, Inaba; 5, Hoki; 6, Idzumo; 7, Iwami; 8, Oki.\r\n\r\nSan yo do. The fore or south Highland route. Eight provinces--1,\r\nHarima; 2, Mimmesaka; 3, Bizen; 4, Bitsjiu; 5, Bingo; 6, Aki; 7, Suwo;\r\n8, Nagato.\r\n\r\nNankai do. Southern sea route. Six provinces--1, Kii; 2, Awadsi; 3,\r\nAwa; 4, Sanuki; 5, Iyo; 6, Tosa.\r\n\r\nSei kai do. Western sea route in Kiusiu. Eleven provinces--1, Tsikuzen;\r\n2, Tsikugo; 3, Hizen; 4, Higo; 5, Buzen; 6, Bungo; 7, Fiuga; 8, Osumi;\r\n9, Satsuma; 10, Iki; 11, Tsusima.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Siomu created an office in the island of Kiusiu, Da zai\r\nfu, but it is now done away with. All the lords of that island were\r\nformerly required to come to Miako once every four years.\r\n\r\nMilitary department. The imperial guards are called Sho ye (Ch., Chu\r\nwei,) “all keep.”\r\n\r\nSa kon ye fu, and Oo k., office of the left and right guards. A\r\nmilitary office is Jing, or Goong, or Oo rin goong, or Ye fu no jing.\r\n\r\nTai sho, generally commander-in-chief of the army, is sometimes called\r\nShiogoon and Baku foo, is always of the highest rank, his office making\r\nhim of equal rank with the Sadaijin.\r\n\r\nBesides the Tai sho there are two officers, the Sa and Oo daisho;\r\nsometimes called Sakonye no taisho. The Sadaisho is the superior\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nChiujo, lieutenant-generals of the guards, four, or at times six,\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nSa kon ye no Chiujo and Oo kon ye, men of high rank.\r\n\r\nShojo (small general), major-general. Of these there are eight or ten.\r\nAre also of high rank, especially if appointed while young.\r\n\r\nShogeng. Military officers of inferior rank to the above.\r\n\r\nShoso. Secretaries; adjutants.\r\n\r\nBanjiu. Also called Konye no to neri--servants. All the officers above\r\nare near the Emperor as guards.\r\n\r\nGay ye. Outer guards.\r\n\r\nThe office is Sa (and Oo) ye mon no foo. The Emperor Sanga changed the\r\nname from Ye ji no foo.\r\n\r\nSa ye mon no Kami.\r\n\r\nSa ye mon no ske, etc.\r\n\r\nSo (or Oo) hio ye no foo is another office.\r\n\r\nSa (or Oo) hio ye no Kami is head officer of high rank. This officer is\r\nfrequently mentioned by the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nSa hio ye no ske.\r\n\r\nOo hio ye no ske, etc.\r\n\r\nSoma rio or Sa-oo ma rio. The office of right or left superintendent of\r\nthe cavalry.\r\n\r\nSa ma no Kami; Oo ma no Kami. Both of high rank.\r\n\r\nSa ma no gonno Kami; Oo ma no gonno Kami.\r\n\r\nSke and Gonno Ske. These take rank above all other ske.\r\n\r\nSa and Oo ma no dai jo and shojo. This is the first rank attained by a\r\ncommissioned officer in the army.\r\n\r\nHio ngo rio. Ordnance storehouse.\r\n\r\nHio no Kami. One officer.\r\n\r\nGay boo no Kwang. The outer military department. The army in\r\ndistinction from the guards.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the army are very ancient. In Tenshio dai jin’s time, the\r\ntitle of the commander-in-chief was Fu dzu nushino kami, known by his\r\nposthumous honors and title as Kashima Mio jin in Hitatsi province. The\r\ntitle of Shiogoon (tsiang kiun) was first used by the Emperor Shiu jin\r\n50 B.C. In the Emperor Kei ko’s time, his son, Yamato taki no mikoto,\r\nwas dai shiogoon, and there were two others, Sa and Oo shiogoon.\r\nThis Yamato overran all Japan and the island of Yezo, also the three\r\ncountries of Sinra, Corea, and Haxai or Hiakusai, provinces of what is\r\nnow known as Corea, and put into them Japanese offices and officers;\r\nand after that commenced Goonfoo or military offices, or, in short, a\r\nstanding army.\r\n\r\nChinjiu foo. Office for northern provinces. C. no Shiogoon, an officer\r\nwho is general and commander-in-chief in the provinces of Mootz and\r\nDewa. Mootz no Kami (Sendai) is generally the hereditary Shiogoon of\r\nthese provinces. He is bound to keep, in the two provinces, an army of\r\n5,000 men.\r\n\r\nChinji foo no fooku shiogoon is an officer called out only during war.\r\n\r\nChinji foo no goon kan, etc.\r\n\r\nSe i dai Shiogoon (Ch., Tsing i ta tsiang kiun), tranquilizer of\r\nbarbarians; great army general. Yamato take no mikoto was the first\r\ncalled Tai shiogoon. Se i was a title first given to Bunya no wata maro\r\nfor bringing all the wild northern part of Japan under rule. This is\r\nthe officer known to foreigners as Tycoon.\r\n\r\nSee i shi. The office of the tranquilizer of barbarians.\r\n\r\nSei fu is one name by which the Shiogoon’s castle in Yedo is known.\r\nThis title--and it is now only a title--has for long been in the\r\nMinnamoto family. Yoritomo was Sei Shiogoon (not Kubosama, as Kæmpfer\r\nsays).\r\n\r\nSinwo. Imperial families; previously explained.\r\n\r\nKoongio. This class includes all of the first three ranks, and Sanghi,\r\nthough of fourth rank. Only three men have been of the first rank and\r\nfirst class while alive, Tatchibanna moroye, A.D. 749; Fusiwara no\r\nOshikatz, 762, a great tyrant; and Nangatte, so bad a man that the book\r\nwill not say when he lived, A.D. 770, 780. These three men all lived\r\nand rose to power one after the other during the reign of Koken the\r\nEmpress. This woman is notorious in Japanese history for her outrage of\r\nmorality in her conduct with Dokio, a priest. She seems to have shown\r\ntalent and capacity in her public position, and reascended the throne\r\nas Shio toku after one abdication.\r\n\r\nDaijodaijin, Kwanbakku, Sessio, Sa and Oo daijin, previously explained.\r\n\r\nSho shin, all beneath the third rank, including Tenjio bito and\r\nJeengay, being so called, includes some Koongays and all the Daimios.\r\n\r\nKindatchi, sons of the Gosekkay.\r\n\r\nSho dai bu, officers of the fifth rank and below.\r\n\r\nSamurai are all military men and civilians who are independent of trade\r\nor farming.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s wife has the title of Ko-ngoo.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s widow has the title of Nioying.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s daughter has the title of Nei shin wo.\r\n\r\nThe female attendants are called Jo wo ro.\r\n\r\nThe female inferiors are called Ko jowo ro and Chiu ro.\r\n\r\nThe female lowest class are called Gay ro.\r\n\r\nThen follow the titles of Buddhist officials in temples, such as--1,\r\nDai so jo, equal in rank to Shanghi; 2, Ho yin; 3, Ho-moo; 4, Sowodz\r\nand Gonno Sowodz; 5, Ho-ngong; 6, Ris shi.\r\n\r\nThere are different titles of inferior orders of priests who have to do\r\nwith ritual, worship, funerals, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe above gives an imperfect sketch of the offices, with the titles,\r\nranks, and degrees, of the officers connected with the government of\r\nJapan. Such information is at the best uninteresting; but when it is\r\nconveyed in names which have no meaning, it becomes, without some\r\npractical acquaintance with the country, as difficult as it is useless\r\nto attempt to master the subject. But to one living in the country this\r\nknowledge is indispensable, and even for reading the letters of the old\r\nJesuits, who seem to have been thoroughly acquainted with the names\r\nin common use by the people, some such information is very needful.\r\nThus we find, among many others, they speak of Toronosqui as Cauzuye\r\ndono, and of Don Austin as Chikara dono, titles which are rendered in\r\nthe above list as Kadznyay no Kami and Chikara no Kami. These titles,\r\nas has been said, are in use at the present day, but they refer more\r\nto the old form of government of Miako, which has been supplanted by\r\nthe more recent imitation of it at Yedo. The latter having retained\r\nthe whole executive in its hands, the mere form has been left to\r\nMiako. Now, when the country has begun to have relations with foreign\r\ncountries, the difficulty of the double government is hanging over the\r\nrulers, who have not yet seen that one must be swept away as a thing\r\nno longer required. The two parts of the double government come into\r\ncollision in presence of third powers. The Government of Yedo is still\r\nto be explained, and the reader will then be able to see how far the\r\nopposing interests of the two capitals throw difficulties in the way of\r\nsmooth progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE EMPIRE TO THE DEATH OF NOBU NANGA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of the history of Japan which has most interest to a\r\nEuropean is that during which intercourse was carried on with Europe.\r\nBut, independently of this new and interesting element introduced into\r\nthe country, this is, even to a Japanese, the period of the history of\r\nhis country which has most interest. It was the termination of a long\r\nsuccession of bloody civil wars, during which the whole empire was\r\ndeluged with blood, lasting long enough to make the country a desert,\r\nthe inhabitants savages, when agriculture was totally neglected, and\r\nthe knowledge of letters nearly forgotten. Family ties were broken;\r\nyoung men were all soldiers; young women were common property. The\r\nJapanese may well look upon the man raised up, and who proved himself\r\nable to put an end to such a state of things, as a hero, and think\r\nhis family worthy of the highest honors. To reduce order out of chaos,\r\nto insure his country 250 years of peace, during which time every one\r\nhas been able to sit under his own vine, and to rear his family in\r\nhappiness, and gather in the fruits of his labor in peace, may well\r\nrank Iyeyas as among the illustrious of men.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in order to understand the working of the government\r\nas it exists at present, to have some knowledge of the events which\r\npreceded and gradually led up to the period when this change began.\r\n\r\nIn the works of Klaproth and Kæmpfer will be found notes of the earlier\r\nhistorical events occurring in Japan. What follows here is derived from\r\nthese and other sources, and is an attempt to notice some of the more\r\nprominent important events, and to give some interest to the subject\r\nby bringing it down to the present time. It is unnecessary in such a\r\nsketch to go back to the time of remote antiquity, or to try to get\r\nglimmerings of light out of fables, such as the different generations\r\nof heavenly and earthly emperors. To notice shortly the more prominent\r\ncharacters and events may be deemed sufficient.\r\n\r\nAmong the first of these prominent characters was Yamato Daki no\r\nMikoto, prince of warriors, commander-in-chief, and of the imperial\r\nfamily. He is supposed to have lived during the second century. He\r\noverran the eastern and northern parts of Japan as far as the island of\r\nYezo. A story is told of his wife having thrown herself into the sea\r\nto appease a storm, and from his lamentations over her, as Atsuma or\r\nAdzuma, the eastern provinces are spoken of as Adzuma, now sometimes\r\napplied to the east generally, and more specially to the inhabitants,\r\nwho are spoken of as Adzuma Yebis, or “boors of the east,” by way of\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nAnother of these early events in the history of Japan, which bears\r\nan interest even to the present day, is the invasion and conquest of\r\nthe southern part of Corea by the Empress Jingu kogu, known by her\r\nhusband’s name as Chiu ai tenwo, in the third century. The Emperor, her\r\nhusband, was the son of the above-mentioned Yamato. She accompanied\r\nhim to the island of Kiusiu, whither he went to put down a rebellion\r\namong some tributary states; but before the operation was accomplished\r\nhe died, and she assumed the reins of power. Her prime minister was an\r\nold man, Take ootsi no Sukonne. After raising troops, and collecting\r\nships to transport them across the sea, she found herself pregnant, but\r\nshe was fortunate enough to find a stone which delayed her accouchement\r\ntill her return to Japan. Having subdued the three countries of Sinra,\r\nKorai, and Hakusai, and compelled them to give up their treasures\r\nand to promise to pay annual tribute to Japan, she returned to bury\r\nher deceased husband, and was soon after delivered of a son, who was\r\nafterward the Emperor Osin, known better by his posthumous title of\r\nHatchimang. Two older sons of her husband by a concubine, asserting\r\ntheir rights of primogeniture, and probably doubting the virtues of the\r\nstone, raised an army to oppose the Empress. Take ootsi was sent to\r\ndefend her rights, and he put them to flight.\r\n\r\nThere is no incident more frequently taken for a subject by painters\r\nin Japan than the Empress Jingu and her infant in the arms of the aged\r\nTake ootsi. She is worshiped under the name of Kashi no dai mio jin;\r\nbut though her victories threw more luster over the arms of Japan, in\r\nforeign warfare, than any previous reign, or, it may be added, any\r\nsubsequent one, she does not seem to rank so high in the estimation of\r\nher subjects, or in the company of the gods, as her son. During his\r\nreign, Wonin--descended from one of the Emperors of China of the Han\r\ndynasty--is said to have introduced for the first time Chinese letters\r\nfrom Corea. His tomb stands in the neighborhood of Osaka, and divine\r\nhonors have been accorded to him. As has been remarked, it may be\r\ndoubted how far the Japanese, with their previous use of Chinese titles\r\nand names of gods, officers and men, could have been ignorant up to\r\nthis time of the art of writing. To the Emperor Osin, though unborn,\r\nappears to have been given the credit of the conquest of Corea. After\r\nhis death, in A.D. 313, divine honors were paid to him. He was styled\r\nand worshiped as the god of war, and under the title Hatchimang-dai\r\nBosats he is represented as an incarnation of the Buddha of the eight\r\nbanners. The largest temples have been raised in his honor, and every\r\nvillage, almost every hill, has its Hatchimang goo or shrine in honor\r\nof Hatchimang, the god of war.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Buddhism was the next event of importance in the\r\nhistory of Japan. This is said to have taken place toward the middle of\r\nthe sixth century. But it may be presumed, when the Emperor receives\r\nthe posthumous honor of a Bosat, or Bodhisattwa, in the fourth century,\r\neither that the title was given long after his decease, or that the\r\nreligion was beginning to be introduced at an earlier epoch. In all\r\nprobability Wonin, who had access to the imperial family, and must have\r\nhad great influence, had sown the seeds of the new doctrine, and had\r\ngiven the title to his patron. These seeds may not have borne fruit for\r\n200 years; but considering the communication in past times with China,\r\nit is difficult to conceive total ignorance of these doctrines. To\r\nCorea, therefore, Japan was again indebted for a religion. In the year\r\n552, during the reign of the Emperor Kin mei, the King of Hakkusai,\r\na district of Corea, sent an embassy with a present of an image of\r\nBuddha Sakya mooni, with Buddhist books, to the Emperor. The priests\r\nof the old Sinto religion were roused, but the new made its way. The\r\nSinto religion seems to be all prayers, without any idea of a being to\r\nwhom to pray beyond white paper, or a mirror, as an emblem of purity.\r\nThe Buddhist religion supplied this, and presented what is required by\r\nmany minds, the idea of a pure life through self-denial--self-denial\r\ngiving a man power over himself, and enabling him to be the servant or\r\nthe master as his church may require. During the succeeding reign, In\r\nconsequence of an epidemic, some persecution of the new doctrines was\r\nattempted; but Moumaya do no wosi, son of the Emperor, being a convert,\r\nwas very zealous in the propagation of the faith; while Nakatomi,\r\nthen in power, and of the family who superintended the Sinto rites,\r\nopposed him. But the son of the Emperor (known by his Buddhist name\r\nZiou go taisi, or Sho to ku tai si) prevailed. He was appointed regent\r\nduring the reign of the Empress Sui ko. He was a very gentle character,\r\nstrictly acting up to the injunctions of the new faith. At his death,\r\nin the beginning of the seventh century, there were, according to the\r\nAnnales, 46 Buddhist temples, 816 priests, and 569 “religieuses” in the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Buddhism through China and Corea brought with it,\r\nas might have been expected, some of the customs of these countries.\r\nThe use of the Nengo (Nien hau; _i.e._, year name) for marking events\r\nand dates was one of the customs introduced in the year 646 A.D. A\r\nwoman ruling as Empress was another of the changes, and was probably\r\nused as a means for the consolidation of the new religion. Under the\r\nEmpress Sui ko the degrees of rank among the officers of government,\r\nsimilar to those used in China, were introduced about 604 A.D. Six\r\nranks, of two grades each, were settled in place of the nine ranks, of\r\ntwo grades each, as in China. These were distinguished, as in China,\r\nby their head-dress, and by the color of the dress. They were called\r\nby the allegorical names of Virtue, Humanity, Manners, Faith, Justice,\r\nWit. The first Empress was followed in no long time by a second, Kwo\r\nkogoo, and during her reign she had the good fortune to have as a\r\nminister and counselor Nakatomi-kamatar iko. He was not a Buddhist,\r\nbut had no doubt felt the influence which the spread of this doctrine\r\nhad exercised over Japan, and is reputed to this day one of Japan’s\r\ngreatest men, and looked up to as the founder of her law. During a\r\nlong life he seems to have steered safely through the difficulties\r\nof politics--acting as counselor to his mistress, Kwo kogoo, her\r\nbrother who succeeded her, Kwotoku, and again when his former mistress\r\nreascended the throne as Zai mei, and subsequently her son Ten\r\nsi--gaining over those who might have been his opponents by suavity and\r\ngentleness of demeanor. The last-named Emperor deplored his loss, and\r\ngave him the hereditary name of Fusi wara, a family of which he was the\r\nfounder. He was canonized after death, and worshiped as Kassunga dai\r\nmio jin, his temple being near Narra. During his life, and the reign of\r\nKwotoku, the eight boards were completed after the model of the Lok po,\r\nor six boards of China.\r\n\r\nAnother change, which commenced after the introduction of Buddhism, was\r\nthe abdication of the Emperors after very short reigns. This led again\r\nto the successive appointments of mere children as Emperors. The ages\r\nat which several of the Emperors, over a lengthened period, ascended\r\nthe throne, tended to reduce the position of Emperor to a name, and\r\nto throw the entire power into the hands of the ministers. The system\r\nbegan shortly after the introduction of Buddhism at court, and the\r\nminds of the boys and women who successively were nominal sovereigns\r\nof Japan were directed to the study of books of the religion, to the\r\nerection of magnificent temples, and to the manufacture of enormous\r\nidols and bells; such as the enormous copper figures of Buddha at\r\nNarra, Kamakura, and Miako. The latter has been melted down and a\r\nwooden figure substituted. Such were the Empress Sei wa, who began\r\nher reign at the age of nine; Yozei, who commenced his at the age of\r\neight; Daigo, at thirteen; Reizan, a weakly lad of eighteen; Yenwou, at\r\neleven; Go itsi, at nine; Konye, at three; and Rokusio, at two. But at\r\nintervals when a man ascended the throne, as the Emperor Ten si, it is\r\na relief to see that some energy remained in the members of the royal\r\nfamily; and at times the national vigor was shown, and the military\r\nspirit, which the people are always proud of asserting, was fanned,\r\nby wars with Dattang (or Tartary) and Corea in 658 and 661. About the\r\nsame time Yezo was once more overrun by Japanese arms and brought into\r\nsubjection, military stations and officers being appointed in the\r\nisland and in the hitherto barbarous provinces of Mootz and Dewa, in\r\nthe north of Nippon. Revolts in the island of Kiusiu about 740 demanded\r\nfresh action from the center, and tend to show what a loose hold this\r\ncentral power had at that time over the extremities of the country.\r\nNot till the year 794 was this central power finally fixed at Miako.\r\nAbout this year the Emperor Kwan mu built a large palace there, finding\r\nthat the magnitude of the business transacted by the eight boards of\r\nthe empire demanded some settled place at which the court and the\r\nheads of departments might be permanently located. To the introduction\r\nof Buddhism and Chinese literature we may ascribe the completion, by\r\nFusiwara (Tankai ko), who died in 720, of the “Ritz Rio,” a code of\r\nlaws which are in force and use at the present day. The introduction of\r\nan alphabet or syllabary (the Hira Kana and Kata Kana) to facilitate\r\nthe reading and understanding of Chinese was the work of the famous\r\npriest Ko bo, born in the province of Sanuki in 774, and who died in\r\n835. He was canonized as Kobo dai si, and is venerated as one of the\r\nholiest saints of the Japanese calendar, and consequently was very much\r\nabused by the Jesuits. He spent some part of his life in China studying\r\nunder the Buddhists of the time, and brought with him, as many others\r\ndid, large numbers of Buddhist books. The enduring property of Japanese\r\npaper and the absence of white ants have preserved these, and doubtless\r\nin some of the libraries of the country and Corea there may be found\r\nworks of great interest to the student of early Buddhist history in\r\nChina and India. The Issyekio or catalogue of all Buddhist canonical\r\nbooks has been lately republished.\r\n\r\nThe custom grew gradually into use of the Emperor, after his\r\nabdication, adopting the garb of a priest, shaving his head, and\r\nretiring to a religious life. This seems to have been in many cases\r\nmerely nominal, as some retained not only an interest, but took\r\nan active part, in the affairs of the world; while to others the\r\nretirement was a relief and an opening to license. The power, numbers,\r\nand wealth of the Buddhist monasteries had vastly increased. They\r\nthreatened to monopolize the land of the empire; and the head of a\r\nmonastery was equal or superior to one of the most powerful princes.\r\nNot only were the priests themselves living off these lands, but\r\neach of these establishments had a number of retainers and soldiers\r\nsufficient to change the tide of success in any engagement.\r\n\r\nFor three or four centuries the history of the empire may be written\r\nin the successive rise to power of individuals of the great families\r\nof the peerage--Fusiwara, Sungawara, Minnamoto, Tatchibanna, and\r\nothers. Names which are regarded as illustrious in history, and held in\r\nveneration to the present day, occasionally shine out, such as Kan sio\r\njo, better known by his posthumous title, Ten mang, the son of Sungawar\r\nzay zen kio. He has the reputation of having been a very able man, and\r\nwas Kwan bakku and Nai dai jin. Fusiwara no toki hira, ancestor of\r\nKoozio dono of the present day, became very jealous of him, and Ten\r\nmang being of a quiet disposition, Toka hira obtained an order for his\r\nbanishment to Dazai fu, in the island of Kiusiu. Here he retired to the\r\nhill Ten pai zan, in Tsikuzen, and endeavored to get a letter conveyed\r\nto the Emperor, but failed in doing so, and was found starved to\r\ndeath on the 25th day of the second month. A fable is told of letters\r\nhaving passed between him and Haku raku teng, a Chinese poet, both\r\nletters being so similar that only one word out of fourteen differed.\r\nThe repetition of the story in connection with the greatest literary\r\ncharacter of the country may show what admiration Chinese literature\r\nwas held in by the Japanese, and how it was considered the standard of\r\nexcellence. Ten mang occupies in Japanese schools a somewhat similar\r\nposition to that held by Confucius in the Chinese. He is worshiped\r\non the 25th of each month, a day which is marked as a holiday. On\r\nthe anniversary a matsuri or festival is held--“Natane no goku.” His\r\nposthumous title is Ten mang dai ji sei ten jin. His descendants are\r\nknown as Ten jin sang. Of temples to his memory there is in Miako a\r\nfine one at Kitano, called also Say bio, and in Yedo at Kame ido, and\r\nat Yooshima and Shibba. In that at Miako the gilding and lacker are\r\nrenewed every fifty years. There is in it a large library, with many\r\nold pieces of armor and spoils taken during the wars with Corea. These\r\nare exhibited annually on the mooshi boshi day, “insect-brushing-away\r\nday,” when the temple is cleaned.\r\n\r\nAmong others who made a name for themselves by their bravery and other\r\nqualifications was Yoshi iye (son of Yori yoshi, Prince of Mootz),\r\none of the Minnamoto family, born 1057, and known in history by the\r\nappellation given him by his enemies of Hatchi mang taro, or eldest\r\nson of the god of war. His third son was Yoshi kooni, who settled at\r\nAshikanga, in the province of Simotsuki, and is the common ancestor of\r\nthe celebrated families of Ashikanga and Nitta.\r\n\r\nIn 1008 the Empress was one of the great clan of Minnamoto, which\r\nwas rising to power. The distant parts of the empire were being\r\nconsolidated by operations against rebels, and the repeated\r\ntransmission of large bodies of troops to the different parts of the\r\nislands to put them down. This war began to create an excitement or\r\nrivalry among some of the leaders, who, when the rebellions were\r\nput down, had the wish for more enemies to conquer, and could only\r\nturn round in jealousy upon their equals. Yoshi iye was sent to the\r\nprovince of Mootz as commander-in-chief, and, after many years’\r\nfighting, subdued the rebels, and brought this province, as well as\r\nall the Kwanto (the provinces “east of the barrier of Hakonay”), into\r\nsubmission. His son Tame yoshi desired the same post. To Taira tada\r\nmori, descended from the Emperor Kwan mu, was given the island of\r\nTsussima, and in 1153 his son Kio mori succeeded him as President of\r\nthe Criminal Tribunal. This name calls up, to any one acquainted with\r\nJapanese history, the recollection of the most stirring events and the\r\ngreatest struggle which has ever convulsed the empire of Japan. This\r\nstruggle was between the Gen or Minnamoto and the He or Taira families.\r\nHe and Taira are the same word in Japanese writing, meaning “peace,”\r\nthe former being the pronunciation of the Chinese word ping. The\r\nMinnamoto family, or Gen ji, stood on the broadest basis, and had risen\r\nto the greatest fame, and had recently occupied the highest positions\r\nin the state. The Empress had been of the family, and the memoirs of\r\nthe family had been written for her edification or to gratify her own\r\nor her family’s pride. On the other side, members of the Taira family,\r\nor He ji, had occasionally risen up to high rank in the state; and\r\nrecently the family had been honored for its prowess and its activity\r\nin the imperial service.\r\n\r\nYoshi tomo and Kio mori were rising step by step to higher rank and\r\npower, when the abdication of Toba no, 1123, and the question as to his\r\nsuccessor, threw everything into confusion. His immediate successor\r\nwas his son Sho toku, in 1124, who after reigning seventeen years\r\nretired (mainly on account of the intrigues of his stepmother) at the\r\nage of thirty-nine. He left a son, Sighe shto, but was succeeded by\r\nhis half-brother, Kon ye no in, who, after reigning fourteen years,\r\ndied at the age of seventeen. The latter had been elevated to the\r\nthrone by the intrigues of Bi fouk mon, his mother, and she suspected\r\nthe late Emperor of having caused his death in order that his own\r\nson Sighe shto might ascend the throne. But in order to defeat these\r\nprojects, she induced her son on his deathbed to adopt his half-brother\r\nGo ziro kawa. A younger son was thus in actual possession, while his\r\nnephew and the eldest son of the elder brother were displaced. The\r\nlineal heir endeavored to regain his rights. He raised an army, and\r\non his side were ranged as leaders many of the higher members of the\r\nMinnamoto family. On the other side was Kio mori, of the Taira family,\r\nand, of the Minnamoto family, Yoshi tomo and Tada mitsi. A battle was\r\nfought only eleven days after the death of the old Emperor Toba no\r\nin. Notwithstanding the bravery and prowess of the leaders of their\r\nopponents, the He ji, the party in power, gained the day. Among the\r\nleaders of the Gen ji was Tame tomo, famous for his power in drawing\r\na bow (owing, perhaps, to the one arm being shorter than the other),\r\nand, in his subsequent life, as a rover over the Southern seas. He was\r\nthe first historical occupier of the islands to the south of Japan,\r\nHatchi jo and its chain, linked on to the southeastern promontory,\r\nand the Liookioo Islands, with the chain joined by links to the\r\nsouthwestern promontory of the mainland. He was the brother of Yoshi\r\ntomo, who fought on the opposite side. As a reward for their success\r\non behalf of the Emperor _de facto_, Go ziro kawa, Minnamoto Yoshi\r\ntomo and Taira Kio mori were both raised to higher rank and power, and\r\nto each was given a province as a more substantial acknowledgment of\r\ntheir assistance. From this time mutual jealousy seems to have grown\r\nup between these two. But the ability of the reigning Emperor, who\r\nthenceforward took the reins into his own hands, seems to have kept\r\ndown their smoldering jealousy. As to the prince who was endeavoring to\r\nresume his lawful rights, he and his father, the Emperor Sho toku, were\r\nbanished to the province of Sanuki, where the latter died in the year\r\n1163. He died of starvation, having written a letter to the Emperor\r\nwith his blood, upon a piece of his shirt; but Kio mori would not let\r\nthe Emperor see it.\r\n\r\nThe banished Emperor Sho toku was devoted to his worship, and since\r\nhis death he has to many worshipers taken the place of Compera. This\r\nis a name much worshiped in Japan as a god. As a hideous idol with\r\na long nose he has temples erected to his worship in every village.\r\nImmediately after the death of Sho toku, in 1163, a violent storm or\r\nearthquake took place, and as he was known to have a great reverence\r\nfor Compera, this convulsion of nature was attributed to the anger of\r\nthis supposed being, and a magnificent temple was raised by his son and\r\ngrandson on Dzo dzu Hill (Elephant’s Head Hill), at Matzuyama, near\r\nMarungame, in the province of Sanuki. Sho toku (known by the adopted\r\nname of Seengeen) is by many looked upon as Compera gongen. Compera,\r\nfrom the Chinese characters composing the name, seems to be Kapila, of\r\nIndian mythology. Kapila was known as the founder of the Sankya school\r\nof philosophy in India, which, in reference to the sacred Vedas, held\r\nthe authority of revelations as paramount to reason and experience, to\r\nwhich Buddha, either for his philosophical or his moral or religious\r\ndoctrines, would not submit. Some have thought Kapila and Buddha to\r\nbe the same person. His anniversary day is the tenth day of the tenth\r\nmonth. He is revered for his great strength, which he exerted in favor\r\nof Sakya mooni. In Buddhist history, Daibadatta wished to destroy Say\r\nson--_i.e._, Sakya mooni. He took up a large stone, twenty-four yards\r\nlong and four-arms’ length broad, and threw it down on him. Compera\r\nsaw the action, and instantly stretched out his hand and caught the\r\nstone as it fell. Another name of Compera is He-ira. He is called also\r\nKapira, and “Goo pira,” and “Goo he ira.” The name of Ee ngio wo--power\r\nequal to emperor--is also given to him for his strength. Fudowo mio\r\nis, according to some, the same as Compera. Many persons worship him\r\nbecause his name begins with “gold.”\r\n\r\nKio mori turned out to be the ablest and most unscrupulous minister of\r\nthe time, but the Emperor, who had abdicated, still took the principal\r\nmanagement of affairs during the reigns of his son and two grandsons.\r\nKio mori at the age of fifty-one shaved his head, and nominally retired\r\ninto priest’s orders in 1169.\r\n\r\nYoshi tomo in 1159 had conspired to destroy Kio mori. He failed, and\r\nwas killed while in the bath by his own servant, Osada. His eldest son\r\nwent to Miako with the view of killing Kio mori, but was discovered\r\nand put to death. His second son died. His third son, Yoritomo, born\r\n1147, fled with his mother (Tokiwa go zen, a woman of low origin) and\r\ntwo brothers. Overtaken by snow and hunger, they were arrested and\r\nbrought back, when Kio mori forced her to become his concubine. His\r\nfriends demanded that the children should be put to death, but, at\r\nthe intercession of his own aunt, he saved their lives, but banished\r\nYoritomo to Hiruga ko jima, or one of the islands to the south of Idzu.\r\nThe other two boys, Yoshitzune and Nori yori, were kept in Miako and\r\neducated for priests. The former of them was afterward a well-known\r\nhero. His nickname when a boy was Ushi waka, or young ox or calf.\r\nYoritomo, while a boy, was known as Sama no kami, or captain of the\r\nleft cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt this time, 1170, Tame tomo above mentioned, who had been roving\r\nabout the South Sea for years past, landed on the mountainous province\r\nand peninsula of Idzu, and attempted to raise a rebellion; but his men\r\nwere overcome, and he himself committed suicide. A temple was raised to\r\nhis memory, and he is worshiped both in Hatchi jo and in the Liookioo\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nIn 1171 the Emperor Taka kura no in, at the age of eleven years,\r\nmarried the daughter of Kio mori, aged fifteen years. This rendered\r\nKio mori still more powerful, and at the same time more imperious in\r\nhis conduct. He emerged from his seclusion, and placed his two sons in\r\nthe office of Tai sho or first generals, over the heads of others who\r\nhad hoped for the places. This raised a community of feeling against\r\nhim, and again a conspiracy was made to attack and kill him and the\r\nwhole of his family, but it failed through the treachery of some of\r\nthe conspirators. The Empress, Kio mori’s daughter, 1178, had a son,\r\nand in the following year his own son, Sighe mori, died. This son had\r\nproved some obstacle to the working out of his father’s schemes of\r\nambition, and when he was removed by death Kio mori imperiously ruled\r\naccording to his own pleasure. His grandson, Antoku, in 1181, became\r\nEmperor. Kio mori became very tyrannical before his death; he not only\r\nkept the old Emperor confined, but tried to change the residence of\r\nthe court from Miako to Fu ku wara, and determined to extirpate the\r\nfamily of Minnamoto. Once more a conspiracy was set on foot to destroy\r\nthe family of He, by one of the royal princes, who had suffered from\r\nthe arrogant insolence of Kio mori. Letters were obtained from the old\r\nEmperor and secretly dispatched to Yoritomo, then in banishment on the\r\ncoast of Idzu, who was looked upon as the head of the Minnamoto family\r\nand the chief enemy of Kio mori and the He kay. His brother Yoshitzune\r\nhad escaped from Miako, in the retinue of some gold merchants, to the\r\nprovince of Dewa, and was residing in that province with Hide hira,\r\nMootz no kami. Yoritomo had married the daughter of Hojio Toki massa,\r\nin whose charge he was during his banishment. Through her father she\r\nwas descended from Kwan mu, Emperor, and was afterward known as Ama\r\nShiogoon, or female Shiogoon, her name being Taira no Massa go. When\r\nthe letters were given to him from the Emperor and his son, calling\r\nupon him to raise troops to rid the country of Kio mori, and release\r\nthem from the durance in which they were kept, he immediately wrote\r\nto his brother Yoshitzune, calling upon him to assist him. Under such\r\nsurveillance were these royal parties kept that it was only under\r\nthe guise of paying a visit to the great temple of Miajima, on the\r\nbeautiful island Itsuku jima, in the inland sea, in the province of\r\nAki, then belonging to Kio mori, that the conspirators were able to\r\nget the letters dispatched. Yoritomo, with Hojio, collected what\r\nmen he could, and raised the flag at Ishi bashi yama. When he first\r\nstarted only seven men joined him, and he fought his first battle with\r\nonly three hundred under him, against ten times their number. He was\r\ndefeated, and with his seven friends ran away, and the story goes that\r\nthey all hid in the hollow trunk of a large tree near Ishi bashi hatto.\r\nWhile remaining concealed there, the soldiers, having examined every\r\nother place, came to the conclusion they must be there. A Kashiwara man\r\n(secretly a partisan of the Gen party) volunteered to go and look, and,\r\nthough suspected, he was allowed to do so. He went up, looked in, and\r\nsaw the party hiding, and told them to lie still, and taking his spear\r\nshowed his commander that he could turn it all round the hollow. When\r\nhe did so, two bats or birds flew out, and he told his commander that\r\nthe mouth of the hollow was covered over with spiders’ webs. The party\r\nof soldiers went away. Yoritomo and his friends left immediately, and\r\nwent to a temple, where they were secreted in the wardrobe for storing\r\nthe dresses of the priests. Meantime the soldiers returned, looked into\r\nthe tree, and found that they had been there. They then went to the\r\ntemple, demanded of the priest where they were secreted, and, on his\r\nrefusing to tell, they killed him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Yoshitzune collected what forces he could, and with them went\r\ndown to Kamakura, at the head of the Odawara division of the Bay of\r\nYedo.\r\n\r\nYoritomo was forced to take refuge in the remote peninsula of Awa,\r\nsoutheast of Yedo, whence he dispatched missives calling on all the Gen\r\nfamily to collect, sending Hojio, his father-in-law, to the province of\r\nKahi, and joining Hiro tsune with a large body of men on the banks of\r\nthe river Sumida gawa, that division of the Tonay gawa which runs past\r\nthe eastern side of Yedo. In the province of Musasi he was joined by\r\nHatake yama; while his relation, Yoshi naka of Kisso, raised an army\r\nin Sinano. Yoritomo fixed upon Kamakura, in the province of Segami,\r\nat a very early date, for his residence. This beautiful classic spot\r\nis within two hours’ ride of Yokohama, and shows now little trace\r\nof having once been the residence of a court. Trivial circumstances\r\nprobably led him to this conclusion, as it does not seem to be a\r\nplace suited in any way for a large city or for the capital of a\r\ncountry. He was a man of great ability, and of strong will, but had\r\nreceived no education; and having been brought up in the province of\r\nIdzu, had acquired the dialect of the district. The mountain-pass of\r\nHakkone is considered the key to the eastern provinces, and if it were\r\nsufficiently guarded, his position would be one of comparative safety,\r\nat a distance of a day’s march from the pass. His relation, Yori Yoshi,\r\nhad formerly resided there, and he had probably looked upon it, when\r\na boy, as the family property. From his residence here he was called,\r\nby the people of Kwanto, Kam kura dono, a name by which he is spoken\r\nof to this day. Kwanto literally means east of the barrier--_i.e._,\r\nof Hakkone--and is synonymous with Ban do, east of the hill. It is a\r\nname by which are understood all the eight provinces to the east of\r\nthe range of hills running down the promontory of Idzu; viz., Segami,\r\nMusasi, Simotsuki, Kowotsuki, Simosa, Kadsusa, Awa, and Fitatsi. It is\r\ncalled also Kwang hasshiu.\r\n\r\nForces were sent from Miako by Kio mori to oppose Yoritomo, but at\r\nthis time his relative Hojio met him with a large re-enforcement, and\r\nthe He party retired without fighting. Yoritomo overran the province\r\nof Fitatsi and put to death Satake Hide Yoshi. The whole empire was\r\nnow desolated by war. The tide began, before Kio mori died, at the age\r\nof sixty-four, in 1181, to turn in favor of the Gen party. But so long\r\nas Kio mori lived the cause of his opponents did not seem to hold out\r\nmuch prospect of success, and the relatives of Yoritomo are still found\r\nfighting against him, and on the side of the ruling party. Among these\r\nwere his own uncle Yoshi hiro, and Yoshi naka, another relative. The\r\nlatter was afterward reconciled to Yoritomo, and rendered him great\r\nassistance, being everywhere victorious in the northern provinces of\r\nEtsjiu and Kanga. Thence he rapidly pushed on to the capital, and\r\nseized the extensive monastery of Hiyaysan. The Emperor Antoku fled\r\nwestward with his wife, Kio mori’s daughter. His grandfather, the\r\nold Emperor Go Zirakawa, received his deliverers in Miako, and still\r\nretaining his interest in the regulation of affairs, saw another\r\ngrandson, brother of Antoku, proclaimed as Emperor. The possessions\r\nof the He party were confiscated and divided among the members of the\r\nGen family. Antoku remained about Da zai foo, the station from which\r\nmilitary superintendence of the island of Kiusiu was regulated, but\r\nfrom this island the He party was driven out and crossed over to Sikok.\r\nStill they were able in different parts of the country to make a stand,\r\nand even to defeat their adversaries in more than one battle. Several\r\nof the party had been left in Miako in posts of consequence, the son of\r\nKio mori being regent, and they did what they could to support their\r\ncause in the capital. Yoshi naka, who had seized Miako on the part of\r\nthe Genji, became in his turn overbearing, and roused the impatience\r\nof the old Emperor, who stirred up the priests of the monasteries of\r\nHiyaysan and Midera to oppose him. But Yoshi naka suddenly came upon\r\nthem, seized and imprisoned the Emperor, and beheaded the abbots of the\r\nreligious houses. He caused himself to be created Sei dai Shiogoon,\r\nand finally set himself up in opposition to Yoritomo. Yoshitzune and\r\nNori Yori, brothers of Yoritomo, were immediately dispatched from\r\nthe Kwanto to Miako to attack him, and set free the Emperor and his\r\ngrandfather, and he was defeated by them and killed. Meantime, 1184,\r\nthe He ji had been gathering their strength in the western provinces,\r\nand had assembled an army of 100,000 men and fortified themselves. Nori\r\nYori and Yoshitzune attacked them, and after a very severe engagement\r\ntook the fort by assault and completely routed the army, killing\r\nmany of the leaders of the party. After this Yoritomo ordered his\r\nson-in-law, son of Yoshi naka, to be put to death, and Yoshitzune was\r\nappointed governor of Miako. He attacked the enemy in the island of\r\nSikok, and also in the western provinces of Nagato, and at the fort of\r\nAka Magaseki routed them; the mother of the Emperor escaping with the\r\ntwo insignia of rule--the sacred sword and the seal or ball. But in\r\ncrossing over from Simonoseki the Emperor threw himself into the sea\r\nand was drowned. Of the two sacred emblems, the sword was said to have\r\nbeen lost; the seal was saved. At this narrowest part of the passage\r\nbetween Kiusiu and Nippon runs a ledge of rocks, and upon these stands\r\na small column, or tombstone, to the memory of the Emperor. On the\r\nKiusiu side is the village of Dairi, called so from the imperial family\r\nhaving rested there. Moone mori, one of the party, is said to have fled\r\nto the island of Tsussima, where his descendants to this day rule as\r\n(the Chinese sound of the name) Sso. When the men of the party were\r\nall destroyed, the females crowded the port of Simonoseki, and were\r\nobliged to live by prostitution; and hence the females of this class in\r\nSimonoseki are accorded to this day the first rank of the class, and\r\nprivileges--in the way of dress, such as wearing stockings, and wearing\r\nthe knot of the obi or belt behind, like other women, and not before,\r\nas prostitutes--which are denied to others. In the center of the\r\nisland of Kiusiu, between Fiuga and Higo, is a high tableland, partly\r\nmarsh, extending from twenty to thirty miles in length. According to\r\nnative accounts, this place was, a hundred years ago, quite a _terra\r\nincognita_. About that time it was discovered that there were people\r\nliving in three villages within the marsh. The principal village was\r\ncalled Mayra. Further investigation being made, it was discovered that\r\nthese were remnants of the He ji, who had fled there at this period,\r\nand had isolated themselves through fear. They had conveyed their fears\r\nto their children, who, when visited, had a dread of being punished\r\nfor the crimes of their forefathers. The three villages are now under\r\ncharge of a Hattamoto.\r\n\r\nThe power of the He family was thus completely broken, and that of the\r\nGen or Minnamoto firmly established, mainly through the prowess and\r\ngeneralship of Yoshitzune. Yoritomo began to be jealous of his brother\r\non account of the credit and reputation he had gained by his success.\r\nHe picked a quarrel with him on the ground of his having married a\r\ndaughter of the enemy of the house, Kio mori, and sent forces against\r\nhim, demanding of the Emperor that his father-in-law, Hojio, should be\r\nappointed generalissimo, by this means filling the places of command\r\nwith his own creatures. Yoshitzune left the capital and retired to\r\nOshiu to his old friend Hide Hira, governor of the province. Yoritomo\r\nwas enraged at an asylum being given to his brother in the north, and\r\nsent orders to have him put to death. Yasu hira, the son of his old\r\nfriend, attacked him, and Yoshitzune, being unprepared and seeing no\r\nway of escape, destroyed himself, after first killing his wife and\r\nchildren. Yoritomo, angry with the man for doing what he himself had\r\nordered, marched against Yasu hira with a large army, and finally\r\ndestroyed him. Yoritomo built a palace for himself in Miako, but\r\nappears generally to have lived at Kamakura. At this latter place are\r\nto be seen to this day the remains of his work in the roads cut through\r\nrocks which confined the space of ground set apart for his residence.\r\n\r\nIn 1190 he went to Miako, where he had built a palace, and in great\r\nstate visited the Emperor; but after a month’s residence in the\r\ncapital he returned to Kamakura. In 1192 the old Emperor Go zira kawa\r\ndied at the age of sixty-seven. He had lived, after his abdication,\r\nduring parts of the reigns of five emperors, his sons and grandsons.\r\nHe had during forty years taken a very active part in the working of\r\nthe government, and had passed through the most exciting time in the\r\nhistory of his country. His last years were spent in tranquillity.\r\n\r\nYoritomo was appointed Sei dai Shiogoon. Suspecting his brother Nori\r\nYori of plotting against him, he banished him to Idzu, where he was\r\nsoon after put to death. He again visited the capital for four months\r\nin 1195, but returned to Kamakura, from which place he virtually ruled\r\nthe empire. He fell from his horse toward the end of 1198, and died\r\nshortly after, in 1199, at the age of fifty-three. He is generally\r\nregarded as the greatest hero in Japanese history. But his treatment of\r\nhis brother has been a great blot upon his character, and lowered him\r\nvery much in the regard of his countrymen. Yoshitzune is looked upon\r\nas the mirror of chivalry, and his conduct is held up to the youth of\r\nthe country for imitation, rather than the calculating, bloody, though\r\nbrilliant career of Yoritomo.\r\n\r\nKamakura seems to have occupied under Yoritomo very nearly the same\r\nsituation, in a political point of view, that Yedo does in the\r\npresent day. The absence of external foes having created a necessity\r\nfor internal division, two courts arose, the one with forms without\r\npower, the other wielding all the power and dispensing with the forms,\r\nexcept when it suited him to demand them. Yoritomo seems to have been\r\nthe first to establish his court in the eastern part of the empire,\r\na retreat which he chose probably on account of its retired and\r\ndefensible situation. Standing upon the sea, the place is inclosed by\r\nhills, and in order to obtain access to the town a road was cut on\r\neither side through the hills. That to the east, toward Kanesawa, is\r\na fine perpendicular cutting through sandstone. The houses occupied\r\nby Yoritomo, and after him by Ashikanga, or the sites where they\r\nstood, are pointed out. Here stands a fine temple to Hatchimang,\r\nerected since the days of Yoritomo, and upon the spot where his son\r\nwas assassinated. It is known as Suruga oka Hatchimang. An avenue with\r\nthree fine stone archways leads straight to the sea from the door of\r\nthe temple. Upon the platform on which the temple stands is a small\r\nshrine to Inari, the god of rice, worshiped everywhere in Japan;\r\nanother to the spirit of Yoritomo; another to stones in which some\r\ndivine power is supposed to reside. Two stones below show that the\r\nPhallic worship lingers in Japan, female (so to speak) as well as male,\r\nwhile a temple on the shore, near Ooraga, is entirely devoted to this\r\ninfatuation. The tomb of Yoritomo, an unpretending slab, is in the\r\nneighborhood. A small hill opposite has the name of Kinoo hari yama,\r\ntaking this name from Yoritomo having ordered it to be covered with\r\nwhite silk to show some of his lady friends how it looked in winter.\r\nThe story may be doubted, if it were only on account of the scarcity\r\nof silk at that time. At Kanesawa are the tombs of the servants of\r\nYoshitzune. About half a mile from the temple of Hatchimang, on the\r\nroad to Fusisawa, is the fine old temple called Kenchoji, built by\r\norder of Moone taka Sinwo, son of the Emperor Sanga. Further on is a\r\nnunnery or convent for ladies, the Matzunga oka. Looking toward the\r\nsea, the little island or peninsula of Eeno sima is visible. On the\r\nroad in this direction is a temple built by a daughter of Mito; a\r\nlittle beyond is a place famous for the manufacture of swords; and\r\nbeyond this is a village with a temple to Kunon, the goddess of mercy\r\n(Kwan yin of China).\r\n\r\nTurning to the right from the village is a large copper figure of\r\nBuddha sitting in the open air, in a position and with an air of great\r\nrepose. It is between forty and fifty feet high. Around this colossal\r\nfigure are seen in the grass large flat stones. These are the bases\r\nof the pillars of a temple which once covered the figure. But during\r\na severe earthquake a rush of the sea over a temporary subsidence\r\nof the land swept away everything but the massive figure and\r\nfoundation-stones of the temple. It looks at present far out of reach\r\nof the renewal of any such devastation.\r\n\r\nThe glory of Kamakura has removed to Yedo, and what is said by the\r\nJesuit fathers to have been at one time a town of 200,000 houses is now\r\na village of not 200 cottages.\r\n\r\nThe son of Yoritomo, Yori ye, succeeded him in all his employments;\r\nbut proving unequal to the task of governing, he retired, and his son,\r\nSanne tomo, at twelve years of age, was appointed Sei dai Shiogoon,\r\nTokimasa, father-in-law of Yoritomo, being regent; and from this date\r\nthe power of the Hojio family began. The following year they put to\r\ndeath Yori ye. Tokimasa assassinated Hatake yama, and afterward had\r\ndesigns upon Sanne tomo’s life at the instigation of his wife; but\r\nthey were discovered by Sanne tomo’s grandmother, Yoritomo’s widow,\r\nand Tokimasa was banished. Sanne tomo was assassinated by his brother\r\nKokio (who had become a priest, and officiated in the temple) while\r\ndescending the stairs of the large temple of Hatchimang goo, at\r\nKamakura, after worshiping there at night. He was the last Shiogoon\r\nof the family of Yoritomo. The power fell to the hands of Hojio no\r\nYoshi toki, who ruled with Masa go, widow of Yoritomo, known as “Ama\r\nshiogoon,” or the Nun commander-in-chief. Hojio Yasu toki was Sikken,\r\na title which was afterward changed to Kwan rei, or minister to the\r\nShiogoon at Kamakura, and began to assume a similar position toward\r\nthe Shiogoon that the latter held toward the Emperor. Hojio and Hasago\r\nraised to the office of Shiogoon Yoritsone, son of Fusiwara no Mitsi\r\nye. Yoritsone resigned the post of Shiogoon at the age of twenty-seven\r\nto his son, aged six, who the following year married a daughter of\r\nHojio. The father and son, being in 1251 discovered to be concerned in\r\na plot against the Emperor, were seized; and the office was now given\r\nto one of the royal family from Minko, Moone taka, “Sin wo.” In his\r\ntime Hojio Toki yori, then Kwanrei, built the large temple of Kenchoji\r\nat Kamakura. The Hojio family (Fosio of Klaproth) at this time absorbed\r\nthe chief authority in the empire.\r\n\r\nThe historical notes which follow are taken from a native almanac with\r\nthe assistance of a native, and are in themselves uninteresting; but\r\nthey give some short notice of the wars between the Emperors of the\r\nNorth and South, of the rise to power of different families--such as\r\nHojio, Ashikanga, Nitta, Hossokawa, and others--who occupied prominent\r\nplaces in Japanese history down to the time of Nobu nanga, when a\r\nmilitary genius arose to extract order out of confusion, and system\r\nout of a chaos of anarchy. But even the confused and uninteresting\r\nmass of names entangled in facts may give an impression of what the\r\nstate of the country was during a period when nothing but turmoil and\r\nboiling brought one after another to the surface, to make way in turn\r\nfor others from the abyss below. That some information is contained in\r\nthese notes, may be an excuse for placing them here in such a meager\r\nand unentertaining form. But the names of individuals, of places, of\r\ntemples, become interesting as more is known of the history of the\r\ncountry and the religion of Japan.\r\n\r\nIn 1260 the Nitsi ren sect of Buddhists was introduced at Kamakura,\r\na sect which has become of more prominence lately, since foreigners\r\narrived in Japan, owing to a saint of the sect, Saysho gosama, having\r\nbeen a great persecutor of Christians.\r\n\r\nHojio Toki yori, minister of the Shiogoon, one of the great men of\r\nJapan, died in 1263, aged thirty-seven; and the Shiogoon Moone taka\r\nwas forced to resign, and his son, Kore Yassu, a child, raised to the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIn China, the Mokoo (or Mongol), about 1276, had overthrown the Sung\r\ndynasty. Corea was compelled to become tributary, and embassies from\r\nChina were sent to Japan, calling upon the Emperor to send his tribute.\r\nAt different times several large naval expeditions were fitted out by\r\nthe Chinese emperor, the Kublai of Marco Polo. One of these, in 1281,\r\nreached the coast of Tsussima; but in consequence of severe storms,\r\nsaid to have been raised by the opportune assistance of the god at Isse\r\n(whence he is called Kase mo mia, or god of the wind), the vessels\r\nwere knocked to pieces, and 30,000 men taken prisoners and killed. One\r\nof the embassadors was beheaded at Kamakura. The power of the Hojio\r\nfamily had become so great at Kamakura that they retained in their own\r\nhands the appointment of Emperor.\r\n\r\nIn 1282, the Sikken, or Kwanrei, died, and was succeeded by his son,\r\naged fourteen years; so that at this time it would appear that the\r\ncountry was governed by a deputy or assistant of a boy, the deputy or\r\nminister of the commander-in-chief under the reigning Emperor, with the\r\nadvice and assistance of one, and perhaps two, abdicated Emperors.\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not be expected to continue, and could only\r\nexist in a country with no external relations and with no neighbors.\r\nThe divided government made up to some extent for this want, but it\r\nleft so many opportunities for individuals plotting to seize the\r\npower that it is no wonder that the Emperors and the Shiogoons chafed\r\nunder it. This was met by a constant accession to these high posts\r\nof children, who, when they began to be troublesome, were forced to\r\nresign, the Hojio family continuing to hold the real power at Kamakura\r\nand Miako, and also in Kiusiu, and deposing the Emperors and Shiogoons\r\nwhen they pleased, and electing whomsoever suited them.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1284 the laws of the country seem to have followed a\r\npolicy of exclusion. In that year an officer came over from China in\r\nthe quality of embassador, accompanied by a priest, but he was taken\r\nand executed on the pretext that he was come to spy out the land. Some\r\nyears after, another priest, Na yissang, came from China, and he also\r\nwas treated at Kamakura as a spy, and imprisoned, but was afterward\r\nliberated, and built the temple of Nan jenji, still standing in Miako.\r\n\r\nIn 1308, Hana zo no, then twelve years of age, was chosen by the\r\nofficers of the Hojio family at Kamakura as Emperor.\r\n\r\nIn 1312 the Kwanrei Hojio Sada toki died, much respected, and the place\r\nof minister was kept for his son, Sada toki, for five years by two\r\nrelations, till he was fourteen years of age, when he became Kwanrei.\r\n\r\nThe executive at Kamakura had named Godaigo as successor to the\r\nEmperor, and he came to the throne when he was thirty-one years of age.\r\nHe very soon began to be irritated with the position he held, ruled\r\nover by subordinates at Kamakura. He married the daughter of Chiooso\r\nKane Kado, a high officer of Chinese extraction.\r\n\r\nIn 1321 the office known as the Ki rokusho was established in the\r\npalace at Miako.\r\n\r\nTaka toki, the young Kwanrei, was very dissipated, passing his time\r\nbetween wine and women, and in consequence was hated; and in 1325 Yori\r\nKazoo and Kooni nanga, by secret orders from the Emperor, set out on\r\nan attempt to take his life; but he was previously informed of it, and\r\nseized them, and put them to death. Taka toki being ill, shaved his\r\nhead and took orders when he was twenty-four years of age, and his\r\nrelative, Taka Ske, at Nagasaki, assumed the chief power. The arrogance\r\nof the Hojio family at Kamakura excited intense ill-will at Miako, and\r\nthe attempt to overthrow this power gave rise to the troubles known as\r\nthe war between the North and South Emperors, which desolated Japan for\r\nmany years, and which ended in the downfall of both the Emperor and the\r\nHojio faction.\r\n\r\nIn 1327, Oto no mia, one of the Emperor’s sons, determined to break\r\ndown the power of the Hojio family at Kamakura; but his intrigues were\r\ndivulged, and he was compelled to shave his head and become a priest,\r\nas Tendai no Zass, or head of the Buddhists. But this did not prevent\r\nhim putting on his armor again when occasion offered. He afterward,\r\nunder the name of Mori Yoshi, was Shiogoon.\r\n\r\n1330. The Emperor still longed to destroy the influence of the Hojio\r\nparty. He consulted with the Buddhist priests, then a very powerful\r\nbody in the realm. He built the fortress of Kassangi in Yamato, to be\r\nseen to this day; but his design was discovered, and he was obliged to\r\nfly to this fort, whence he sent for Koosinoki massa Singhi, then a\r\nsmall officer in Kawadsi, but considered a very able soldier.\r\n\r\nIn 1331 the forces of Taka toki attacked and took the castle of\r\nKassangi, and taking Godaigo prisoner, sent him to the island of Oki,\r\nand for some years there was no Emperor. Ko gen was called “Tenwo”\r\nby the Kamakura party, but he was called the False Emperor by his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nIn 1332, Otonomia, Nitta, and Koosinoki met at Chi wa ya, a castle near\r\nMiako. While the Kamakura army of Hojio overcame the other detachments,\r\nthey were repulsed by that under Koosinoki. Nitta Yoshi assembled an\r\narmy in the province of Kowotski. Troops were sent against him from\r\nKamakura, but after several engagements he marched upon and sacked\r\nand burned that town. Among the officers of the Hojio party some were\r\nkilled in battle, others were beheaded, and many killed themselves.\r\nAmong the last was Taka toki. His son had his throat cut. In Kiusiu the\r\nHojio party was defeated by Owotomo, who seized the governor, whose\r\nlife was saved, but all the other members of the Hojio family, who\r\nhad been so overbearing during their period of rule, were massacred\r\nby the people. Their authority, which had been paramount for years in\r\nKamakura, and thence in the empire, was completely broken down.\r\n\r\nGodaigo was restored to the throne. He had not improved by adversity,\r\nand was weak in his character. He removed all the officers in place,\r\nand, against the advice of his friends and ministers, conferred rank\r\nand power on Ashikanga Taka ooji, who had entered into a conspiracy\r\nagainst him, and who afterward became the most powerful man in the\r\nempire and founder of a long line of Shiogoons. The Emperor gave to\r\nthose who had assisted him large landed possessions: to Ashikanga, the\r\nprovinces of Hitatsi, Musasi, and Simosa; to Nitta Yoshi Sada, Kowotski\r\nand Harima; and to his son, Etsingo; to Koosinoki, Setsu and Kawadsi;\r\nand to others in proportion. Mori Yosi, the royal priest, had been\r\nappointed Shiogoon, but at the instance of Ashikanga was imprisoned and\r\ndeposed. The Emperor had been warned against Ashikanga by Madenga koji\r\nchika foossa, his minister, in vain. This minister was the author, in\r\n1341, of the “Shoku gen sho,” the red book of the court of Miako.\r\n\r\nThe war which was now commencing is known as the war between the\r\nNorthern and Southern Emperors--the Hokko cho and the Nancho. Each\r\nparty set up one Emperor after another, while the war raged under\r\ngenerals who were fighting for the office of commander-in-chief rather\r\nthan for the empire. Ashikanga and Nitta, Koosinoki and Hossokawa,\r\nKikootchi and Owotomo, were the prominent leaders; while Godaigo,\r\nas Emperor of the South, was succeeded by Go mura Kami, retaining\r\npossession of, during a series of misfortunes, the three insignia of\r\nimperial power. On the other hand, Ko gen, called False Emperor, was\r\nsucceeded as Emperor of the North by his brother Komio, who abdicated\r\nin favor of Sh’ko, who was taken prisoner, and Ko ngong took his place;\r\nbut he and both his predecessors fell into the hands of their opponent.\r\nAfter the destruction of Kamakura and the downfall of the Hojio family\r\nin 1332, the theater of war changed to the neighborhood of Miako. Yoshi\r\nmitz, afterward the great Ashikanga, was appointed Shiogoon in 1367,\r\nwhen he was ten years of age. On both sides treachery on the part of\r\nthe generals seems to have been a trivial and common occurrence; and\r\nthis is not surprising, inasmuch as there was no principle involved,\r\nand no party-cry to rally under. Each general was fighting for himself\r\nand for his own advancement, while the opposing Emperors looked on\r\napparently without much feeling or interest in the question at issue.\r\nBy this war in the island of Kiusiu the family of Satsuma largely\r\nincreased its power and possessions at the expense of Kikootchi.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1392, by the mediation of O-ooji, lord of the provinces\r\nin the west part of Nippon, peace was brought about. He induced the\r\nEmperor of the South to bring to Miako the three emblems, and to\r\ngive them up to his rival, accepting the title of Dai jio ten wo.\r\nThenceforward both Emperors lived in Miako, Go ko matz reigning.\r\nDuring the first troublous times Ashikanga had been strengthening his\r\nposition, enriching himself and rising in rank and favor to the highest\r\nposition to which a subject could attain. He built a splendid house for\r\nhimself in Muro Matchi Street, called the Palace of Flowers, and two\r\nothers called respectively the Gold and Silver Houses, which were large\r\nenough to be taken away in pieces (after his death) and form parts of\r\ndifferent temples, of which these parts are still looked upon as the\r\nchief ornaments. Such is the temple of Tchikuboo shima in the Great\r\nLake. The titles given him were the head of the Gen family: Joone san\r\ngoo--_i.e._, as the Emperor’s second son--and Dai Shiogoon. He was at\r\nlength, before he was forty, raised to be Dai jo dai jin, and during\r\nthe following year he gave up his titles and place, and, shaving his\r\nhead, retired under the Buddhist name of Zensan, or Heavenly Mountain.\r\nHe moved about with a style and equipage similar to that used by the\r\nEmperor. He sent an embassy to China, and received an answer, in\r\nwhich he was styled Nippon wo or King of Japan. The Emperor visited\r\nhim, and conferred on him the title of Kubosama--Kubo being the title\r\nof the father or predecessor of the Emperor after abdication, sama\r\nimplying that he is equal to or “the same as.” He was the first to\r\nwhom the title was given, and it is still a title which is conferred\r\nby the Emperor, and is not inherent in any office. He died in 1408.\r\nThe office of Shiogoon became hereditary in the family of Ashikanga,\r\nand henceforth the position of Kwanrei or Minister to the Shiogoon\r\nwas aspired to as conveying the chief power in the empire. Kamakura\r\nwas still the usual residence of this officer. Eight families were\r\nset apart, from among whom it was eligible to name the Kwanrei, chief\r\namong whom were Hossokawa, Hatake yama, and Ooyay soongi--the family of\r\nHossokawa being at this time the most powerful. After the death of the\r\ngreat Ashikanga, his descendants were unable to wield the power which\r\nhe had transmitted to them. He does not seem to have established any\r\npowerful government throughout the empire, but would appear to have\r\nheld what he had seized rather from the country being tired of civil\r\nwar than from any great administrative talent in himself. During the\r\ncentury which followed, civil war seems to have been the normal state\r\nof Japan--one man after another rising to seize the reins--at one time\r\nat Miako, at another at Kamakura. No one chief was able to reduce the\r\nwhole empire to a settled state of tranquillity. If one rose a little\r\nabove his compeers, they combined against him; while the monasteries\r\nand religious sects were so powerful as to be able to insure success to\r\nwhatever side they gave their influence and assistance. This state of\r\nthings continued till Nobu nanga gradually rose out of the crowd, and\r\nstruck down the power of these Buddhist sects.\r\n\r\n1410. While the appointment of a Dai or great Shiogoon was kept up at\r\nMiako, an inferior officer, with the title of Shiogoon only, was placed\r\nin Kamakura, with a minister under him. The men who filled both offices\r\nwere still of the Ashikanga family. When so many high offices were held\r\nby powerful chiefs, jealousy was excited, and this kept up a state\r\nof constant civil war in some parts of the country. The three rich\r\nprovinces of Bizen, Mimesaka, and Harima were taken from the owner,\r\nAkamatz, who to revenge himself invited the Dai Shiogoon to a banquet\r\nand assassinated him. He in turn committed suicide, and his territory\r\nwas divided.\r\n\r\nIn 1414 the three emblems were stolen, but were afterward recovered.\r\nThe family of Hossokawa was rising to power and wealth at Kamakura,\r\nwhile that of Ashikanga was on the wane.\r\n\r\nIn 1415, for the first time, an act was passed by the ruling powers\r\nknown as a Tokusayay. This is a law suddenly passed, by which all\r\nmercantile engagements are at an end and all debts cancelled. This act\r\nof arbitrary, high-handed injustice has been carried out over and over\r\nagain in Japan, and is generally the act of some high officer who has\r\nborrowed money largely. Whether it was carried to the full extent\r\nstated may be doubted, but it has been the cause of much trouble and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nIn 1462 Ashikanga nari ooji, son of the former Shiogoon of Kamakura,\r\nwas obliged to fly to Ko nga in the province of Simotsuki.\r\n\r\nIn 1466 the war known in history as the “Onin” commenced, and lasted\r\nduring the following eleven years. The dispute arose between two sons\r\nof the chief Shibba, in which the late Shiogoon and his successor took\r\nopposite sides. This was the breeze which fanned the smoldering flame\r\narising in the desire on the part of the wife of the abdicated Shiogoon\r\nthat her son should be nominated to succeed, otherwise he would be\r\ncompelled to shave his head and become a priest. The whole country\r\naround Miako was desolated by war and slaughter, great excesses being\r\ncommitted, during which houses, temples, libraries, and documents\r\nof value were destroyed, and, as might have been expected, a famine\r\noccurred in 1472. This, together with the death of the generals\r\ncommanding on both sides--Yamana Sozeng and Hossokawa--led to a\r\ncessation of hostilities in 1474, when some years of quiet and peace\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n1487. The famous Ota do Kwang was assassinated by Sadamasa. An anecdote\r\nrelated of him is often taken as a subject by Japanese artists. He was\r\nout hawking when a heavy rain came on. Seeing a little cottage, he with\r\nhis attendants went to ask for a grass rain-coat. A beautiful young\r\nwoman came out, and upon his asking for what he wanted, she went to the\r\ngarden, pulled a branch of a flower, and kneeling down presented it to\r\nthe gentleman. Looking at the plant, he at once perceived that she was\r\nmodestly making a play upon the word rain-coat, the plant being known\r\nby the name of “no seed,” which implied also by a turn of words that\r\nshe had no rain-coat to give him.\r\n\r\n1487. War again broke out between the Shiogoon and Sasaki in the\r\nprovince of Oomi, which lasted for three or four years, when the\r\nShiogoon fled to the territories of O-ooji, then chief of the western\r\nprovinces of Nippon.\r\n\r\nAbout 1494 the family of Hojio of Odawara took its rise in the person\r\nof Zinkio, who had been a merchant in Isse, but whose genius seems\r\nto have been military, and who was known afterward as Hojio so woon.\r\nHe seized whatever territory in the Kwanto and around the castle\r\nof Odawara he could lay his hands upon. During these periods this\r\nunfortunate country was not only desolated by civil war and all its\r\nhorrors, but it suffered severely in addition from convulsions of\r\nnature. In 1472 a famine arose as the concomitant of war. In 1475 a\r\nvery extensive earthquake occurred on the sixth day of the eighth\r\nmonth, when a wave from the sea, during a temporary subsidence of the\r\nearth, carried away at one sweep a large part of the lower quarter of\r\nthe city of Osaka. In 1496 there was a drought all over the empire,\r\nwhich was followed by a famine in 1497. And the next year was marked by\r\nsevere earthquakes all over Japan; while in 1506 all the old fir-trees\r\non the hill Kassunga yama near Narra died to the number of above 7,000.\r\nA similar disease had visited Japan in 1406, exactly a hundred years\r\nbefore. Severe drought and dreadful thunderstorms in 1514 were followed\r\nin 1515 by earthquakes over the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe new century brought no cessation from war and assassination.\r\nHossokawa, then prime minister, was assassinated by his servant Kassai.\r\nO-ooji, from the western provinces, marched upon Miako, bringing his\r\nprotégé, the late Shiogoon, with him, and, seizing the capital, caused\r\nthe Emperor to install him as prime minister or Kwanrei, an office\r\nwhich had for many years been in the hold of the three families,\r\nShibba, Hossokawa, and Hatake yama. An attempt was made in Miako to\r\nassassinate the Shiogoon during the night, but he killed the assassins\r\nwith his own sword.\r\n\r\nIn 1510 Nangao, a servant, and relative of Ooyay Soongi, minister at\r\nKamakura, rebelled against his master, defeated him, and entered into\r\npossession of his castle and territory in the province of Etsingo,\r\nwhere he afterward became very powerful as Ooyay Soongi Kengshing.\r\nHossokawa and O-ooji drove one another alternately out of Miako, but\r\nultimately the latter retired to his own western province of Suwo; and\r\nduring the same time Hojio of Odawara was fighting in the Kwanto with\r\nMiura.\r\n\r\n1486. Hossokawa massa moto was made Kwanrei.\r\n\r\nIn 1521, for the first time in many years, the Emperor made a public\r\nappearance. The officers and court were both impoverished. The land\r\nwas barely and sparsely cultivated. The young were growing up in\r\nperfect ignorance. Hossokawa brought Yoshi haru to Miako, and made him\r\nShiogoon, and put the Shiogoon, Yoshitanne, into confinement in the\r\nisland of Awadsi. The following year the latter died in the province of\r\nAwa, where his descendants still live, and the head of the family is\r\nstill known as “Awa kubo.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1523 an attempt was made to commence a trade with China at\r\nNingpo. O-ooji, the lord of the western provinces, sent over ships. But\r\nat this time the coasts of China were infested by Japanese pirates, and\r\nthe attempt to trade does not seem to have been successful: it shows,\r\nhowever, that a commerce was beginning before the Portuguese visited\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n1528. Mioshi kaï woong, from the province of Awa in Sikok, attacked\r\nMiako; the Kwanrei, Takakooni, on the part of the Shiogoon, met him\r\nat the Katsura gawa, the river running into the sea at Osaka, but was\r\ndefeated, and the Shiogoon fled to Oomi, where the head of the Sasaki\r\nfamily gave him shelter.\r\n\r\n1530. The following year the Kwanrei and Mioshi were again at war\r\nin the neighborhood of Osaka, when the former was defeated, taken\r\nprisoner, and put to death.\r\n\r\n1532. Haru moto, whom Mioshi had placed as Kwanrei in Miako, took\r\noffense at some of the proceedings of the latter, and ordered him to be\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n1536. At this period the Emperor was very poor and his expenses were\r\ndefrayed by O-ooji, the lord of the western provinces, to whom the\r\nEmperor gave the title of Da zai no dai ni. The Emperor Go Tsutchi died\r\nin such poverty that his body lay unburied for some days for want of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nTo this date the annals of the Emperors are brought down. Since the\r\naccession of the present dynasty of Shiogoons, the printing of every\r\nwork relative to government is prohibited. There are slight notices of\r\nremarkable occurrences during each year published in an almanac form;\r\nas, for instance, it is noted that in 1533, on the tenth month, eighth\r\nday--_i.e._, November--there were observed an extraordinary number\r\nof falling stars, and in 1534 a very fatal epidemic passed over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n1537. During this year disturbances arose between the Buddhist priests\r\nof the Tendai sect of the Hiyaysan monastery, and those of the Hokkay\r\nor Nitchi ren sect. The former burned down the temple of the latter,\r\nand with it nearly the half of Miako was consumed.\r\n\r\n1538. In Kwanto the chiefs were again at war. Hojio attacked Yamano\r\nootchi in his castle of Kawa goi near Yedo and routed him by a night\r\nattack. Takeda Singeng, now a lad, turned his father out of his\r\npossessions in Kahi.\r\n\r\nIn 1539, muskets were first known--brought over to Tanegasima by\r\nthe Portuguese, pistols being known to this day by the name of\r\n“tanegasima.” According to the “History of the Church in Japan,” “The\r\nislands of Japan were first discovered in the last century, but at what\r\ntime is very uncertain--some say in the year 1534; St. Francis Xavier\r\nbelieved it was rather five or six years after. Be it as it will,\r\nFather Maffius and others tell us that three Portuguese merchants,\r\nAntony Mora, Francis Zaimor, and Anthony Pexot, in their voyage from\r\nDodra, in Siam, to China, were thrown by tempests upon the islands of\r\nJapan in 1541, and put in at the kingdom of Cangoxima.” This is the\r\nsouthern part of the island of Kiusiu, off which lies the island of\r\nTanega or Tanesima. Mendez Pinto, who appears to have been wrecked in\r\nthis vessel, gives no date, but, from his account, the sensation caused\r\nby the pistols and muskets brought to this warlike nation seems to have\r\nbeen much greater than that caused by the apparition of strangers. It\r\nis not wonderful that the year should have been noted in the Japanese\r\ncalendars as that in which firearms were introduced. They did not\r\nanticipate that the arrival of these foreigners was to be to the empire\r\nthe source of much trouble. At this time the Lioo Kioo Islands seem to\r\nhave been well known to the buccaneers on the Chinese coast, and with\r\nthe strong southerly monsoons, so frequently broken up by typhoons,\r\nit was not likely that Japan could remain long undiscovered; and the\r\nJapanese must have known of Europeans and their customs from their own\r\nsailors trading to China and Singapore.\r\n\r\n1540. Mowori Moto nari, ancestor of Choshiu of the present day,\r\nand founder of the family, was embroiled with his feudal superior,\r\nAmako of Idzumo, and gave in his allegiance to O-ooji. This state of\r\ndisturbances is noted in the earliest letters of the Jesuits, written\r\nfrom Amangutchi, the capital of these provinces, which was afterward\r\nvisited by Francis Xavier.\r\n\r\n1542. This year was born (26th day of twelfth month) To sho\r\nShingku--better known as Iyeyas--at Oka saki in Mikawa; and during the\r\nyear Ima ngawa and Nobu hide, father of Nobu nanga, fought a battle\r\nat Atsuka Saka in Mikawa. The Portuguese came to Boongo to trade, and\r\nreceived a warm reception in the territories of Owotomo.\r\n\r\nIn 1543 the Portuguese came back again; Owotomo, Boongo no kami, was\r\nthen lord of this province, and of a great part of the island of\r\nKiusiu. An officer, by name Seito, was sent by him with the Portuguese\r\nto Miako. Hitherto the history of Japan has been made up entirely from\r\nnative sources; but after this time the letters of the Jesuits, and the\r\naccounts published from time to time by Europeans, become of interest.\r\nKagosima, the port of Satsuma at which these Portuguese merchants\r\nfirst touched, is not a place adapted for carrying on a large trade.\r\nIt is too far out to sea, and cut off from the interior (which is not\r\nfertile) by high ranges of hills. The port offered by Owotomo was much\r\nbetter suited to their views. It is in the heart of the inland sea,\r\nwell sheltered, and, at the same time, having water-communication with\r\nthe extensive fringe of coast bordering that sea. The island of Sikok,\r\nthe most fertile part of Japan, was within easy access. The whole of\r\nthe western part of Nippon and the island of Kiusiu could bring their\r\nproducts to this port by water, while intercourse with Osaka and the\r\ncapital was comparatively easy. The objection to Kagosima applies\r\nequally to Nagasaki, which is cut off from trading communication with\r\nthe interior of the country by the difficulty both of its water and\r\nland approaches. The family of Owotomo had gradually risen to wealth\r\nand power in the island of Kiusiu, and at the time the Jesuits arrived,\r\nthe Lord or Tono, called by them Francis, was the greatest of the\r\nfeudal chiefs then ruling in the island.\r\n\r\n1545. Miako was reduced by war and fires to such a state that it\r\nbecame impossible to live in it; whoever did attempt to live there ran\r\nthe risk of being burned, killed, or starved. The Koongays left, and\r\ngenerally settled under the protection of some feudal chief in the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n1548. The Shiogoon, who had fled to Sakamoto, returned to Miako, and\r\nHossokawa was appointed Kwanrei.\r\n\r\n1549. Mioshi tchokay, called Mioxindo no in the “History of the Church”\r\n(or Naga Yoshi), took up arms against Haru moto and the Shiogoon party,\r\nand the latter fled again to Sakamoto, about twelve miles from Miako.\r\nNobu hide, father of Nobu nanga, died, leaving him, his son, heir of\r\nall the possessions he had acquired. Francis Xavier, then at Malacca,\r\nwhither he had gone with the fondness for change and excitement which\r\nseemed to have characterized his career, met with some of those who\r\nwere returning to Japan. He immediately determined to visit it. He\r\narrived in the year 1549, and left it again in 1551, disappointed and\r\ndisheartened with the realities of missionary work. In the “History of\r\nthe Church” it is said, in 1549 (p. 72): “On the way from Amangutchi\r\n(Yama ootchi) to Miako the ways were infested with soldiers, by reason\r\nof troubles between the Dairi and Cubo. Miako inspired Xavier with the\r\ndesire of planting there the standard of Christ, but the effect did not\r\nat all answer his expectations. Miako, which signifies a thing worth\r\nseeing, was no more than the shadow of what it formerly had been, such\r\nterrible fires and wars had laid it waste, and the present condition\r\nof affairs threatened it with total destruction. All the neighboring\r\nprinces were combined against the Cubosama, and nothing was to be heard\r\nbut the noise of armies. However, he endeavored to gain an audience\r\nfrom the Cubosama and Dairi; but his poverty made him contemptible.\r\nIt required 10,000 caixes to gain an audience. To comfort himself he\r\npreached in the streets; but the town being full of confusion, and the\r\nthoughts of every man taken up with reports of war, none listened to\r\nhim. After a fortnight’s stay, hearing that the Dairi bore only the\r\nname of a monarch, and that the Cubo was absolute only in the Tensa and\r\nGokinai, he saw it was nothing but lost labor and expense to have his\r\nleave to preach over all Japan when he was not master.”\r\n\r\n1550. Yoshi haru, late Shiogoon, died. Mioshi tchokay burned Hingashi\r\nyama, or Hiyay san, a collection of monasteries and temples near Miako.\r\n\r\n1551. O-ooji was attacked by the forces of one of his own officers,\r\nSuyay haru kata, who obliged him to fly, and he committed suicide\r\nwith several high Koongays who were residing under his protection.\r\nThis Suyay had promised Owotomo, chief of Boongo, to give back to his\r\nyounger brother, Yoshi Naga, the command in the province of Suwo. At\r\nthe death of O-ooji the seal under which trade with China had been\r\ncarried on was lost, and the trade suspended.\r\n\r\n1552. At this time the religion of Christ was brought, according to\r\nnative accounts, by “Nan bang,” foreigners from the south, to Boongo.\r\nThe period at which this event took place was worthy of note. Japan\r\nhad been for years torn by rival factions, and by the contests of men\r\nintriguing for power. The Emperor was powerless, and reduced by poverty\r\nand neglect to a position bordering on contempt. The eastern court\r\nat Kamakura retained some portions of its former power, and was at\r\nleast a hotbed where schemes might be hatched for overthrowing either\r\nthe power of the court of Miako, or that of some of the neighboring\r\nprinces. Yedo was almost unknown, except as a village dependency of\r\nthe castle. The western provinces were under the sway of independent\r\nchiefs, while the island of Kiusiu hardly acknowledged the authority of\r\nthe Mikado. A small beginning of commerce with China had been going on\r\nfor some years past, and was conducted with Ningpo. It was not likely,\r\ntherefore, that at the first landing upon Tanegasima the country and\r\npeople of Japan were unknown to the Portuguese buccaneers upon the\r\ncoast of China. Not many years had elapsed since China had been first\r\nvisited by the Portuguese, and Liampo or Ningpo was their northern\r\nport. If Mendez Pinto is to be credited, there were 800 Portuguese then\r\nliving near that city under their own laws; but if his account of the\r\ndoings of his countrymen in China be correct--and it is in many things\r\ncorroborated by concurrent testimony--the men who sailed about these\r\nseas were not exactly the men best suited to spread a healthy commerce,\r\nor to propagate correct notions of the Christian religion. They were\r\nthe buccaneers of that day, and mixed up their business of piracy and\r\nmurder with trade and religion in a strange medley. The vast opening\r\nconsequent upon the doubling of the Cape induced these men to push\r\ntheir discoveries further and further. Europe had just been convulsed\r\nby the throes of delivery of the Church of Rome. Twin children had been\r\nborn by the Reformation to the Church, and the schismatic operations\r\nof Luther without gave rise to the crafty strengthening process of\r\nLoyola within the Church. The propagandist zeal of Jesuitism at this\r\nperiod put forth her strength to reap the harvest in Japan; but the\r\nbane of the Church of Rome pursued her here, and her desire to make the\r\nkingdom of Christ of this world brought to naught all her schemes. The\r\nInquisition was in full operation in Portugal and Spain, where John\r\nIII. and Philip II. directed the missions of the Church; and the same\r\nzeal was carried into India and all their foreign possessions. The\r\nwhole power, political and ecclesiastical, in the East, was allowed\r\nby other nations to be in the hands of the King of Portugal: without\r\nhis permission no bishop could be appointed; no episcopal see created\r\nwithout his consent; and he retained the right of filling up vacancies\r\nin every see. No European missionary could go to the East without\r\nhis sanction, and with that only in a Portuguese vessel; and no bull\r\nor brief from the Holy See was of any effect in the East until it\r\nhad received the approbation of the King, who in return was supposed\r\nto protect and support the Church of Rome. This was known as the\r\nProtectorate of the Crown of Portugal, and was annually confirmed by\r\nPapal bulls, in which was inserted a clause whereby the Pope annuled\r\nbeforehand every bull which any one of his successors might issue to\r\nthe contrary. Such was the epoch at which the Portuguese arrived in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n1553. Mioshi attacked and killed Hossokawa, the minister of the\r\nShiogoon, and the following year attacked Miako, whence the Shiogoon\r\nfled to Tanba.\r\n\r\n1555. Fighting was going on between Mowori moto nari (ancestor of\r\nMowori Daizen no diaboo) and Suyay haru taka, who had killed his lord\r\nO-ooji. Mowori was victorious, and gained possession of all the “middle\r\nor central provinces” west of Miako--laying the foundation of the\r\nwealth and power which remain to the family to the present time. An\r\nembassy was sent this year to Japan from China, to complain of pirates\r\nfrom the island of Kiusiu who were ravaging the coasts of China.\r\n\r\n1557. The Emperor Gonara died. Nobu nanga put to death his own younger\r\nbrother Nobu yuki.\r\n\r\n1558. Oki matchi ascended the throne at forty-two years of age. At this\r\ntime Hideyoshi, better known as Taiko sama, as a young man became an\r\nofficer in the service of Nobu nanga.\r\n\r\n1559. Etsingo Nangao Kage tora, a large feudal chief, went to Miako\r\nfrom his province of Etsingo to pay his respects to the Emperor, and to\r\nclaim his installation into the office of Kwanrei, when his name and\r\ndesignation was changed to Ooyay Soongi teru tora.\r\n\r\n1560. Ima ngawa, lord of Suruga, was one of the chiefs who were\r\ncompeting for power. He had raised a large force and met Nobu nanga,\r\nwho was not inclined to face him with a small number such as he then\r\nhad with him; but Hideyoshi persuaded him to join issue, and by skill\r\nand stratagem they defeated and killed Ima ngawa, and Nobu nanga took\r\npossession of all his territory.\r\n\r\n1561. Iyeyas was infeft by Nobu nanga in the province of Mikawa, and\r\nmade the castle of Okasaki his residence.\r\n\r\n1562. Mowori moto nari and Owotomo Boongo no kami, or Zo rin (the great\r\npatron of the foreigners in Kiusiu), were at war, which was terminated\r\nby the interference of the Shiogoon, who sent down a messenger to\r\nrestore peace, through a matrimonial alliance and enlargement of\r\nOwotomo’s territories.\r\n\r\n1563. Fighting was going on in the neighborhood of Yedo between\r\nSattomi, who possessed large territories in Awa and Owota, on the one\r\nside, and Hojio of Odawara on the other. A great battle took place\r\nbetween these chiefs at Kowunodai, near Yedo, in which Sattomi was\r\ndefeated. The defeat took place upon the 9th of the ninth month, a\r\nfestival-day all over Japan. Since the defeat, Kanagawa and Kawasaki,\r\nthen belonging to Sattomi, have held the festival on the 19th. Mowori\r\nMotonari this year completely defeated Amako, the lord Idzumo, and\r\nabsorbed his territories, thus becoming lord of ten provinces.\r\n\r\n1564. Nobu nanga killed his father-in-law Seito Do Sang, the lord of\r\nMino, and seized all his territory, and changed his own residence,\r\nwhich had been hitherto in Nagoya in Owarri, to Gifoo in Mino.\r\n\r\nIn 1565 Matza naga hissa hide (Daxandono, or properly Danshio, in\r\n“History of the Church”) and Mioshi attacked Yoshi teru, Shiogoon, who\r\nwas surprised, and committed suicide. His younger brother Yoshi aki\r\nfled to Oomi, shaved his head, and became a priest. The grandson of\r\nYoshi dzumi aimed at the position of Shiogoon. To oppose the designs of\r\nMioshi, who was attempting to assassinate him, Yoshi aki joined Nobu\r\nnanga, who put him into the post of Shiogoon in 1568, and they together\r\nattacked and defeated Mioshi.\r\n\r\n1569. Nobu nanga found it necessary to begin a crusade against the\r\nBuddhist priests, and their wealthy and powerful establishments. He\r\nattacked and routed and killed Kita batake, the lord of Isse. He built\r\na palace for the Emperor, but it was so small and shabby that the\r\nEmperor would not inhabit it, but lived in the temple of Kammo, near\r\nMiako. This year the palace and castle of Nijio was built in Miako,\r\nand has since been occupied by the Shiogoons as their metropolitan\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n1570. Nobu nanga was fighting with the lord of the province of Etsizen,\r\nAsakura, who was defeated, and his territories seized by Nobu nanga.\r\n\r\nAt this time Nobu nanga, Hideyoshi, and Iyeyas found it their interest\r\nto be friends. Hideyoshi had grown up as an officer in Nobu nanga’s\r\narmy, and both are said to have been jealous of Iyeyas (known as a\r\nyoung man as “Sing Koong”), probably discerning at this early time\r\nsuperior administrative talents, as well as a reticence which may have\r\ndispleased them. He is said to have been put forward by them into\r\ndifficult positions to get rid of him, but the vigor of his character\r\nincreased by overcoming the obstacles in his path. He went to the\r\nprovince of Oomi at the time Nobu nanga was fighting with the troops of\r\nAsayee and Asakura at Anegawa, and by his timely assistance turned the\r\nfortune of the day.\r\n\r\n1571. The Buddhist priesthood had at this time arrived at the height\r\nof their power. The arrival of the Roman Catholics, and the spread\r\nof their doctrines, was probably hailed by many as a relief from the\r\nextravagant pretensions and power of the monasteries, and it was hoped\r\nthat they might in some measure balance the power of the Buddhist\r\npriesthood. All over the country these monasteries had become very\r\nwealthy. The monks, bonzes, or bozans, were very numerous, and their\r\nretainers and dependents formed an army sufficiently powerful to\r\ncope with any single chief. The policy of the Roman Catholics seems\r\nto have been from the first of an aggressive character, attacking\r\nvehemently the native priests, abusing their characters, and getting\r\nup discussions in public, and thus unnecessarily irritating a very\r\npowerful body in the kingdom. Nobu nanga was very jealous of the power\r\nof these Buddhist monasteries, and hated the priests. He therefore gave\r\nhis countenance to these newcomers, who were delighted, as thinking\r\nit showed a zeal for their mission, while, in truth, it was only to\r\ngratify his hatred of the native bozans. He suddenly fell upon the\r\nlargest of the monasteries, the Hiyaysan, also called by the early\r\nwriters Freno yama, and Hiyay no yama. The grounds are said to have\r\nbeen of great beauty, near the lake of Oomi, and inclosing thirteen\r\nvalleys; and at the time the Jesuits arrived in the country there were\r\nsaid to be 500 temples within the area of the monastery. Nobu nanga\r\nburned all the temples and massacred the priests. These latter had been\r\njoined by some of Nobu nanga’s late opponents, but he defeated them all.\r\n\r\n1572. Takeda Singeng, at Mikatta nga harra in Tootomi, was fighting\r\nwith Iyeyas. A great mortality had taken place in the force of the\r\nlatter, and he was nearly overcome, and in great danger, but finally\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nThe same year the Shiogoon Yoshi aki became embroiled with Nobu nanga,\r\nwho arrested him and put him in prison, thus bringing to a termination\r\nthe real power of the Ashikanga family.\r\n\r\nDuring the year Iyeyas was beaten by Takeda near Mitske; he was\r\nobliged to fly, and was pursued across the Tenrio River to a village,\r\nHamamatchi. During the night he heard music, and creeping up with some\r\nof his men to listen, they saw Takeda himself sitting enjoying the\r\nmusic, when one of Iyeyas’s men fired at him with a musket. He was\r\nwounded and gave up the pursuit. He lingered a while, but at length\r\ndied of the injury.\r\n\r\n1574. All over the country Roman Catholic temples were being built,\r\nexciting the Buddhist priesthood to wrath.\r\n\r\n1575. At Nanga shino, in Tootomi, there was some smart fighting\r\nbetween Katzu yori, son of Takeda Singeng, and Iyeyas, as officer of\r\nNobu nanga. Katzu yori was very powerful, and had a large army with\r\nhim of well-trained soldiers, and Nobu nanga was afraid to fight; but\r\nIyeyas declared that if he would not fight he himself would join Katzu\r\nyori.\r\n\r\n1576. Hideyoshi was sent by Nobu nanga to Kiusiu and the west\r\nprovinces. As a whim, he this year made a new name for himself out of\r\nthe half of the names of two of Nobu nanga’s officers, Shibata and\r\nNiwa, and calling himself Hashiba, a name by which he is frequently\r\nspoken of by the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n1576. Nobu nanga built the castle of Azutchi (called Anzuquiama in\r\n“History of the Church”) in the province of Oomi; a castle which now\r\nbelongs to Ee kamong no Kami.\r\n\r\n1577. Matz nanga hissa hide, known in the “History of the Church” as\r\nDaxandono, was killed by Nobu nanga.\r\n\r\n1578. Hashiba hide yoshi was this year fighting with Mowori teru moto,\r\nknown to the Jesuits as the King of Amanguchi, and the island of Kiusiu\r\nwas devastated by war between Owotomo, son of the Jesuits’ friend, and\r\nShimadzu of Satsuma, the result being that Owotomo was defeated and his\r\nterritory much diminished.\r\n\r\n1579. The two Buddhist sects, Jodo shiu and Nitchi ren shiu, held a\r\ngreat discussion upon religion before Nobu nanga at Azutchi, known as\r\nthe “Azutchi rong.”\r\n\r\nAkitchi mitzu hide, one of Nobu nanga’s best officers, seized the\r\nprovince of Tanba. The Ikko shiu, a Buddhist sect, was very powerful at\r\nthis time, and had possession of the castle of Osaka, then known as the\r\ntemple of Hoonganji. Nobu nanga, by one of his generals, had been long\r\nbesieging it, and had failed in taking it. In 1580 he called in the\r\npersuasive interference of the Emperor, and a compact was finally made,\r\nunder which the priests consented to give up this strong fortress,\r\nwhich has ever since remained in the hands of the executive power.\r\n\r\n1581. Hideyoshi this year overran the province of Harima, destroying\r\nthe castle of Miki, and began to build the chateau of Himeji for\r\nhimself in that province; while Nobu nanga, assisted by Iyeyas and\r\nHojio of Odawara, completely demolished the power of the Takeda\r\nfamily in Kahi. The war is known as the “Ten moku san” war, from the\r\nplace where Takeda concealed and destroyed himself. The tie between\r\nNobu nanga and his generals seemed to have been very slight, and he\r\ndoes not appear at any time to have been considered ruler of the\r\ncountry. On more than one occasion Iyeyas threatened to leave him\r\nand throw his weight into the opposite scale. In a portrait drawn\r\nof Nobu nanga in the “History of the Church,” he is described as “a\r\nprince of large stature, but of a weak and delicate complexion, with\r\na heart and soul that supplied all other wants; ambitious above all\r\nmankind; brave, generous and bold, and not without many excellent moral\r\nvirtues; inclined to justice, and an enemy to treason. With a quick\r\nand penetrating wit, he seemed cut out for business; excelling in\r\nmilitary discipline, he was esteemed the fittest to command an army,\r\nmanage a siege, fortify a town, or mark out a camp, of any general in\r\nJapan, never using any head but his own: if he asked advice, it was\r\nmore to know their hearts than to profit by their advice. He sought\r\nto see into others and to conceal his own counsel, being very secret\r\nin his designs; he laughed at the worship of the gods, convinced that\r\nthe bonzes were impostors, abusing the simplicity of the people and\r\nscreening their own debauches under the name of religion.”\r\n\r\nThis is the character given of him by the Jesuits, who considered him a\r\nfriend to their cause and had some hopes of him as a convert. It agrees\r\nin the main with the pictures drawn of him by the Japanese. Hating\r\nthe Buddhist priests, he patronized the Jesuits as a counterpoise,\r\nencouraging them to build even in the neighborhood of his own palace at\r\nAzutchi. Under the encouragement thus given, the Jesuit priests rose to\r\nfavor and power at court. The efforts of the fathers to extend their\r\ninfluence were crowned with success, and at this date the position of\r\nthe church is described as follows: “Father A. Valignan, superior of\r\nJapan, for convenience of government, divided Japan into three parts.\r\nThe first and principal is that island where Miako stands. They had\r\nthere three residences of the Society--Meaco, Anzuquiama (Azutchi-yama\r\nin Oomi) and Takacuqui. In the residence of Miako were two brothers and\r\ntwo fathers, who preached and celebrated the divine mysteries daily\r\nin a very fair church. In Anzuquiama they had two fathers and two\r\nbrothers; the first of these took care of the church, and of all the\r\nChristians round about; the other instructed the young gentlemen in\r\nthe seminary, teaching them their Catechism, and to read and write in\r\nLatin, Portuguese and the language of the country. In Takacuqui (Itami\r\nin Setzu) there was only one father and one brother. Justo Ucondono\r\n(Takayama), governor of the place, built in it a very handsome church\r\nand house for the fathers, and furnished them with all the necessaries\r\nfor their families. About three leagues off were the churches of\r\nVocayama, Fort Imori in Kawadsi, and Sanga--all dependencies of this\r\nresidence. Two leagues from Sanga, Don Simon Tagandono (Tango no Kami),\r\nlord of Yao, had eight hundred subjects, all Christians. There were\r\nalso great numbers of them in Amangutchi, but without any church, it\r\nbeing expressly against the king’s pleasure.\r\n\r\n“The second part of Japan is that which they commonly call Ximo\r\n(Kiusiu). There the Christians had most churches, and the Jesuits most\r\nhouses. In the city of Funay, the metropolis of Bungo, there were both\r\na college and a university, where they took degrees of masters of arts\r\nand doctors of divinity. There were twenty Jesuits in the college. The\r\nnoviceship stood at Vosuqui, where King Francis (_i.e._, Owotomo Boongo\r\nno Kami) resided. Besides, they had two residences--one at the valley\r\nof Ju, some seven leagues from Funay, and another at Nocen--and these\r\nfour houses furnished the whole country with evangelical missionaries.\r\nMoreover, they had a house at Facata, in the kingdom of Chicuzen,\r\nthat was tributary to Bungo; but Aquizuqui, having made himself master\r\nof that country, soon beat them out of those quarters. The kingdom\r\nof Chicungo, bordering upon Chicuzen, had only one church, which was\r\ngoverned since Riozogi’s conquest by a devout Christian, that prince\r\nbeing unwilling to entertain any Jesuits in his states. In the kingdom\r\nof Fingo, which Aquizuqui and Riozogi parted betwixt them, there were\r\ntwo houses of the Society--one in Amacusa and the other at Fort Fundo;\r\nand these two residences took charge of above twenty other churches in\r\nthat country. As for the island of Xequi (Ko Siki), which stands upon\r\nthe confines of Amacusa, they had only one church, with near 5,000\r\nChristians, who were governed by one of the inhabitants; for the lord\r\nof the place, though he was to permit the fathers to visit them, would\r\nnot hear of fixing a residence; which obliged the Christians, on the\r\nmore solemn days, to come over to the church of Amacusa.\r\n\r\n“In the kingdom of Goto (the five small islands to the west of Japan),\r\nsince Don Lewis’s death, there was neither church nor house, the uncle\r\nand tutor to the young prince being, as was said, a most professed\r\nenemy to all religion. The King of Firando, indeed, though a heathen,\r\nwas content to receive two priests and two others for the benefit of\r\nthe Christians, and chiefly his uncle and son, Don John and Don Anthony.\r\n\r\n“As for the kingdoms of Omura and Arima, religion flourished there\r\nabove all other parts, Bungo only excepted. The fathers had three\r\nhouses in Omura, one in Omura itself, where the King kept his court,\r\nanother at Nangasak, and a third at Curi, and out of these three\r\nchurches they visited forty several churches, and had charge of some\r\n50,000 Christians that were in that kingdom. In Arima they had three\r\nresidences: one in the city of Arima, with five Jesuits, whereof two\r\nhad care of the seminary for educating young nobles, among whom was\r\nthe King of Fiungas’ son, cousin-german to the King of Arima, and the\r\nrest, all of them sons to the chief lords in the country; the second at\r\nArie; and the third at Cochinozi, a most celebrated port for commerce.\r\n\r\n“In the kingdom of Saxuma, where St. F. Xaverius landed at his first\r\nentrance into Japan, there were some few Christians whom the fathers\r\nvisited by times, being all banished by the bonzes, who acted by the\r\nKing’s authority. They reckoned in the kingdom of Ximo upward of 30,000\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n“The third part of Japan (Sikok) contains only four kingdoms, and\r\nof these only the King of Tosa received the faith. So Father Alex.\r\nValignan, at the end of his visit, upon his return to the Indies, left\r\n150,000 Christians in Japan, 200 churches and 39 religious of his own\r\norder, besides several able, young and virtuous Japonians who helped to\r\ninstruct the new Christians.”\r\n\r\nIn 1582 Nobu nanga was gradually overrunning all Japan. He had given\r\nthe revenues of the island of Sikok to his son, Nobu taka. “This year\r\nhe built at Azutchi a splendid temple. In this temple he collected\r\nidols of all the gods of Japan, and placed in the midst a statue of\r\nhimself, calling it Xanthi; _i.e._, supreme ruler. He then, like\r\nNebuchadnezzar, issued an edict prohibiting any one from worshiping any\r\nother idol, and ordered all to resort to this place on his birthday\r\nto worship this representation of himself. The first that adored was\r\nhis eldest son. The nobility followed, and then the gentry and people\r\nin their course.” This idol is said to be in existence at the present\r\nday. Nobu nanga, after this public adoration of his statue, returned\r\nto Miako. Akitchi mitzu hide had been one of his most prominent and\r\nsuccessful generals, and was at this time in the neighborhood of the\r\ncapital. Nobu nanga had dispatched a large body of troops to assist\r\nHashiba Hideyoshi in his operations in the west. Whether Akitchi\r\naspired to the position occupied by Nobu nanga, or was really jealous\r\nand hated him, in common with others, as a tyrant, or, as some relate,\r\nsmarted under the insult of being struck by Nobu nanga over the head\r\nwith a fan, is doubtful. But “when he saw that the guards and forces\r\nunder the immediate command of Nobu nanga were so diminished in number\r\nthat he was left nearly unprotected, he took advantage of what seemed\r\nto him an opportunity. He had been ordered by Nobu nanga to take a\r\nlarge body of troops under his command to join Hideyoshi. Accordingly,\r\nhe marched, but, instead of taking the route indicated, he took\r\naside some of the captains whom he knew to be dissatisfied with the\r\ngovernment, discussed with them his design, and gained them over by\r\ndeclaiming against the violence, oppression, and tyranny of Nobu nanga,\r\naccusing him of destroying the gods and murdering the priests, and\r\nconcluding by promises of wealth stored up in the castle of Adzutchi\r\nyama. He then suddenly wheeled round upon Miako, surrounding Honnoji,\r\nwhere Nobu nanga was residing, before he was aware of any danger. All\r\nthe avenues were closed--no escape was left for him. He was washing his\r\nface when the news came that the troops had invested the place, and\r\nopening a window to see what was the matter, they poured in a shower\r\nof darts and wounded him between the shoulders. The place was soon in\r\nflames, and his body was consumed with the building. Thus died Nobu\r\nnanga, at forty-nine years of age, a little after he took upon himself\r\nthe title of god, and had made himself be adored by his subjects.”\r\n\r\nNobu nanga was by birth of higher origin than his successor, Taikosama,\r\nand, as the son of a feudal prince, had, at a time when might gave\r\nright, some pretension to rule. Descended from Kio mori, he was of the\r\nTaira family, that clan which had contested so long with the Minnamoto\r\nfor the executive power in the empire. No question of family origin\r\nentered into his rise or brought about his fall. As an individual, he\r\nrose to power through his military talents; and probably from want of\r\nadministrative ability failed to strengthen himself, or insure to his\r\nsons the succession of the position to which he had risen. The period\r\nof his rule was signalized by the rise and success of the Jesuits, whom\r\nhe countenanced, according to their own showing, rather from hatred to\r\nthe Buddhist priests than from love for the doctrines of Christianity,\r\nor respect for the Roman Catholic priesthood. When he died, the tide\r\nof prosperity turned and ebbed till it gradually swept the whole\r\ndoctrines, priests, and proselytes from the shores of Japan.\r\n\r\nAkitchi mitsu hide, who had thus removed the master-spirit of Japan,\r\nwas not the man to take the vacant seat. Apparently an able second, a\r\nsuccessful lieutenant, he was wanting in every quality for command.\r\nHe had gained over the troops placed in his charge by the promise of\r\nplunder. He marched them upon the city of Azutchi-yama, where Nobu\r\nnanga had stored up the treasures he had accumulated during many years,\r\nand in three days squandered the whole in largesses to those under his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF TAIKOSAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the sudden and unexpected removal of the keystone of the arch,\r\nthere was left a blank to be filled up. It may be said that on either\r\nside was a stone ready for the purpose. On the one side, Hideyoshi, in\r\ncommand of a powerful army, and he himself with a great reputation as\r\na leader and engaged, on the part of Nobu nanga, in a war with Mori,\r\nprince of the ten western provinces; on the other, Iyeyas, firmly\r\nseated as ruler over eight provinces, and hardly acknowledging any\r\nsubmission to the executive at Miako, also in command of an army and\r\nfighting on the side of Nobu nanga against Hojio, lord of Odawara. Had\r\nthe succession been left to the son or sons of Nobu nanga, there was\r\nevery prospect of a continuance of the same state of anarchy and war.\r\nNo one of the three was competent for the post. The eldest, indeed,\r\nhad perished with his father, leaving a son, a child, San hoshi.\r\nThe third, Nobu taka, was lord of the island of Sikok and its four\r\nprovinces. Nobu wo, lord of Owarri, the second son, took part with\r\nHideyoshi.\r\n\r\nIyeyas Mikawa no kami seems, during his career, to have occupied a\r\nposition apart in the empire. This is attributed by his countrymen\r\nto a recognition by Nobu nanga and Hideyoshi of his great talents as\r\na general in command during war, they being always either jealous or\r\nafraid of him. He had been nearly uniformly successful in war, even\r\nwhen fighting against great odds. They had put him into dangerous\r\npositions in the hope of getting rid of him, but he had always come out\r\nof them with additional credit and invariable success. He was ready\r\nto obey and equal to command. Unwilling to thrust himself forward, he\r\ncould bide his time, and was prepared for any emergency. He was born\r\nof a good family, but had cut out for himself a position; and, in the\r\ngeneral scramble for landed possessions at this period, had laid a\r\nsolid foundation in the province of Suruga and Mikawa and some portions\r\nof other provinces. He had already been advanced to high rank by the\r\nEmperor. He resided at Hamamatz, in Towotomi, where he held over the\r\nKwan to supreme sway, with which Taikosama did not think it wise to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi, as has been related, was of low origin, and his birth and\r\nlineage a matter of obscurity; but in such estimation are some sorts of\r\npedigree held in Japan (as in other places) that he contrived to make\r\nit appear that his mother was pregnant with him before she married his\r\nreputed father, Kinoshta mago yaymong. According to his own accounts,\r\nhis mother was daughter of Motchihagee, a Koongay, and during the\r\ntroubles she was obliged to fly, and, falling into great distress,\r\nmarried Kinoshta. She married a second husband, Tchikoo ami. Before her\r\nsecond marriage, she one night dreamed that she had conceived by the\r\nsun, and thence her child was called Hi yoshi maro. He was commonly\r\ncalled Ko chikoo (small boy). His face was small, and he was like\r\na monkey, whence he got the nickname of Saru matz; and, even long\r\nafterward, when he was Kwanbakku, he was called Saru Kwanja, or monkey\r\nwith a crown. When a child, he was very cunning and reckless, and lived\r\non the streets. A story is told of him lying asleep on a bridge in\r\nOkasaka. Among others who passed was Hiko yay mong, a noted robber from\r\nOwarri. He gave the boy a kick, and asked him his name. He said, “Saru\r\nmatz. This is the public road, and is as much mine as yours. Who are\r\nyou?” He said, “I am Hiko yay mong.” “Well,” says the boy, “Hiko is a\r\nthief and a robber, and I have as good a right to be here as he.” He\r\nlong afterward made Hiko a Daimio--the family as Hatchiska existing to\r\nthe present time. He went, when ten years of age, to Hama matz, where\r\nhis master, observing the talent in the boy, recommended him to turn\r\na soldier. He afterward entered the service of Nobu nanga, and called\r\nhimself Kinoshta Tokitchiro. When he rose in military rank, he took the\r\nname of Hashiba Hideyoshi Tchikuzen no kami. In 1583, upon the death of\r\nNobu nanga, he rose rapidly in imperial rank from lieutenant-general\r\nto be Naidaijin and Kwanbakku. As it was unheard-of presumption in any\r\none not of the Fusiwarra family being Kwanbakku, he asked, extorted,\r\nor adopted this family name from the Emperor. But he seems never to\r\nhave used it, and is known by that of Toyo tomi, given him by the\r\nEmperor. In no long time after, he rose to be Dai jo dai jin. He was\r\nKwanbakku during seven years, when he retired under the usual title of\r\nTaiko, given to that officer on retiring, and was known by the name\r\nof Taiko sama, or the Taikosama. After the destruction of Azutchi,\r\nthe city of Nobu nanga, Hideyoshi fixed upon Fusimi and Osaka as his\r\nplaces of residence, taking possession of the castle of Osaka, which\r\ncommands the town, adding to its strength by immense fortifications,\r\nand building in the center a palace of great magnificence. This castle\r\nhad formerly belonged to one of the powerful Buddhist sects, and\r\nhad been wrested from them by Nobu nanga. By command of Taikosama,\r\nimmense canals were dug, and, by artificial means, smaller rivers were\r\nled into that flowing past Osaka, by which, the importance of the\r\ntown as a commercial capital, as well as its strength as a fort, was\r\nmaterially increased. In Miako he built another magnificent palace,\r\nknown as Jui raku; and had another at Fusimi, between Miako and\r\nOsaka. He had married, during his youth, a woman of his own rank. He\r\nafterward married the daughter of Fusi yee; and, thirdly, the daughter\r\nof Gamo Hida no kami. His fourth wife was the daughter of Kio goku;\r\nand the fifth, the daughter of Mayedda of Kanga; and, lastly, Yodo\r\nhime dono, daughter of Azai Bizen no kami, of whom the Jesuit letters\r\nspeak as Kita Mandocoro “quæ est primaria Taici conjunx carissima\r\nerat et conjunctissima.” But notwithstanding this plurality of wives,\r\nit was never pretended that he had a son till his old age. He had a\r\nstepbrother, Hide nanga, and a stepsister, who married Musasi no kami,\r\nand had two sons, Hidetsoongu (who was adopted by Hideyoshi) and Gifoo\r\nsho sho. Another stepsister had a son, Hide toshi, who was adopted by\r\nHide nanga. Hidetsoongu (nephew of Taiko by his stepsister), who was\r\nafterward Kwanbakku, was first adopted by Miyoshi Yamashiro no kami,\r\nand afterward by Taikosama. Taikosama also adopted Hideyuki kingo, son\r\nof Kinoshta, the brother of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe following account of Taikosama is taken from the letters of the\r\nJesuits: “This man (Faxiba, or Hashiba), who was most certainly\r\nimmoderately ambitious, seeing his master dead, and with him his eldest\r\nson, who had left only one child not full three years old; moreover,\r\nfinding the second son to be but a weak man, and the third destitute\r\nboth of fortune and strength to make head against him, he believed it\r\nwould be easy to content him by a donation of some government, and so\r\nthe way was fairly open for himself to step into the throne. To carry\r\non his design, he first sounded all the officers of his army, and\r\nfinding them tight to his interest, for a color of his ambition he took\r\nupon him the title of tutor and governor to the young prince and heir\r\nto the empire, and put him into a fortress with a train answerable to\r\nhis birth. Nobu nanga’s third son soon smelled out his design, and not\r\nable to brook one of his father’s subjects in the government of his\r\nkingdoms, he leagued with several of the lords who were grown jealous\r\nof Faxiba’s power, and resolved to make it a trial of skill; but\r\nFaxiba, who was an old experienced captain, and had good troops under\r\nhim, easily defeated them, and put all to death that durst oppose his\r\ndesigns.” This is hardly correct, inasmuch as, though he marched into\r\nthe province of Mino in pursuit of Nobu taka, third son of Nobu nanga,\r\nand defeated him, he was not so successful in his action against Nobu\r\nwo, the second son, in the year 1584. This latter, without much talent,\r\nhad wit enough to ask Iyeyas to assist him. He came to his assistance,\r\nand in the battles of Komaki and Nangakute, with greatly inferior\r\nforces numerically, defeated, first, Hidetsoongu, Taikosama’s nephew,\r\nand afterward Taikosama himself. Taiko thought it more prudent to make\r\na compact, and having done so, retired to Miako, which Iyeyas permitted\r\nhim to do without further action.\r\n\r\n“Among the confederates of Nobu taka was one Shibata dono,\r\nbrother-in-law to Nobu nanga. He was besieged in the fortress of\r\nShibatta, and seeing no way of escape, he, having dined with his\r\nfriends, wife, and children, and retainers, set fire to the castle,\r\nfirst killing his wife, his children, and the female servants; and his\r\nfriends, following his example, afterward committed suicide, ‘and lay\r\nthere wallowing in their blood till the fire kindled and burned them\r\nto ashes.’” Some of the arms and clothes which were found unburned are\r\nsaid to be all kept to the present day as they were found after this\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\n“Faxiba, being now in peaceable possession of the Tense (or imperial\r\nprovinces), and all Nobu nanga’s other kingdoms, to give color to his\r\nusurpation affected an affable sweetness, which charmed all that ever\r\nsaw or heard him. None, besides the Christians, could in the least\r\nsuspect the sincerity of his intentions; and not long after they, too,\r\nwere quieted of all their fears; for, knowing very well how respectful\r\nthey had been to Nobu nanga, either out of real affection, or for that\r\nhe had no mind to make himself new enemies, he began to caress them,\r\nand gave them several particular instances of his favor. He knew the\r\nChristians in his service to be famous, both for their piety and their\r\ncourage; and, above all, he showed a particular respect for Justo\r\nUcondono (properly called Takayama oo konyay no kami), to whom he had\r\nbeen indebted for his good fortune.\r\n\r\n“So when the fathers went to visit him, he treated them after the same\r\nmanner and with the same ceremony as Nobu nanga had done before him;\r\nand for instance of his real intentions, he appointed them a place\r\nfor building a church and seminary (in Osaka), as was done before in\r\nAnzuquiama. The Queen, his lady, had also several of the Christians\r\namong her maids of honor, whom Faxiba particularly respected for their\r\nsingular modesty and piety. He permitted them to assist at mass and\r\nsermons, and was pleased to show a liking when any of his subjects\r\nbecame Christians, which emboldened them to preach and exercise their\r\nother functions with greater liberty than formerly, to the great\r\nincrease of the faithful. Faxiba, who was advertised of it, far from\r\nbeing displeased, declared he would embrace the Christian religion\r\nhimself were it but a little more indulgent to flesh and blood.”\r\n\r\nTaikosama was feeling his way in the novel position in which he found\r\nhimself after Nobu nanga’s death. The Jesuits did not know how their\r\nposition might be affected. They had basked in the sunshine of court\r\nfavor for some years past; that might now be clouded over. The bozangs,\r\nor native Buddhist priesthood, had been standing in the cold shade for\r\nsome years; they had everything to hope for in a change. There was not\r\nmuch to be feared from Sanhoshi, the infant grandson of Nobu nanga,\r\nas a claimant to the throne. Mowori in the west was quiet. Iyeyas in\r\nthe east was occupied in attacking Hojio of Odawara, who was supposed\r\nto be in opposition to the government. Hojio was superior in the\r\nnumber of his forces, but inferior in the ability of his commanders.\r\nThe proverbial saying of an “Odawara Hio jio”--that is, an Odawara\r\ndeliberation--took its origin in the councils of war of Hojio at\r\nthis time, which, with superior forces, were protracted till Iyeyas\r\nattacked, defeated him, and took the Castle of Odawara.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1583 the Jesuit fathers prevailed upon the Christian\r\nconverts Arima and Omura and Owotomo Boongo no kami to send some\r\nyoung lords on a visit to the Pope. Four were sent, two of them being\r\nrelatives of these lords, and the other two sons of nobles. They were\r\nall four boys of the age of from fifteen to sixteen. They took letters\r\nwith them to Pope Gregory XIII. Leaving Japan on February 22, 1583,\r\nthey, going by Macao and Goa, reached Lisbon on August 10, 1584, and\r\nafter an interview with Philip at Madrid, arrived in Rome on March\r\n20, 1585, where they were received by the Pope, and kissed his feet.\r\nThey re-embarked at Lisbon the last day of April, 1586, with seventeen\r\nreligious of the Society, reaching Goa on May 29, 1587, and finally\r\narrived in Japan in 1590, “eight years from their first setting out,”\r\nbringing with them an Arabian horse, which had been presented to them\r\nby the Viceroy of India.\r\n\r\nIn 1583 Taikosama finished the fortress of Osaka, a work which consumed\r\na great deal of money and occupied a great number of men, and which,\r\nwhen finished, covered a much larger space of ground than that upon\r\nwhich the castle now stands. During this year the island of Kiusiu\r\nwas the theater of war. Riozoji held an office, now done away with,\r\nas governor of the island. He had formerly been a vassal of the small\r\nlordship of Arima, but now had large landed possessions in the island:\r\nand being too desirous of extending his own territory at his neighbors’\r\nexpense, they joined together and rooted him out.\r\n\r\nIn 1585 Taikosama received from the Emperor the family name of\r\nToyotomi. He called himself Fusiwara, and insisted on the Emperor\r\nappointing him Kwanbakku. He had now had sufficient time to feel\r\nhimself settled in his position; but he thought the native monasteries\r\nwere still too powerful, notwithstanding the demolition of Hiyayzan,\r\nthe large monastery near Miako, and the slaughter of great numbers of\r\npriests by Nobu nanga, together with the appropriation as a castle\r\nof the large monastery in Osaka. The sect of Negoros [Negroes in\r\nthe Church of Japan] at Kumano, in the province of Kii, occupied a\r\nvery large monastery, to which the whole of the province belonged in\r\nterritorial right, the military retainers of the monastery being noted\r\nfor prowess and skill in fighting. Taikosama having found or made some\r\ncause of quarrel moved against them, defeated them, and destroyed the\r\nmonastery. Most of these retainers were removed to Yedo, where to this\r\nday they form part of the guard of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nThis year Taikosama sent Nobuwo to order Iyeyas to come to Miako. He\r\nrefused to come until it was arranged that Taikosama’s mother should\r\ncome to Yedo as a hostage during his absence, when Iyeyas went to pay\r\nhis respects to the Emperor. Mowori, lord of the western provinces, was\r\nalso ordered to come to Miako to acknowledge Taikosama as his superior,\r\nan order which he found it prudent to obey. In 1586 Iyeyas married the\r\nyoungest sister of Taikosama.\r\n\r\nA persecuting spirit showed itself among the Jesuits very soon after\r\nthe departure of Francis Xavier. “Sumitanda,” they write, “King of\r\nOmura, who had become a Christian in accordance with a promise to\r\nthat purpose in case his wife should have a child, about the year\r\n1562, or only thirteen years after the first arrival of a missionary\r\nin the country, declared open war against the devils. He dispatched\r\nsome squadrons through his kingdom to ruin all the idols and temples,\r\nwithout any regard to the bonzes’ rage.” All this, doubtless, was done\r\nby the advice and at the instigation of his instructors; and “in 1577\r\nthe lord of the island of Amacusa issued his proclamation, by which all\r\nhis subjects--whether bonzes, gentlemen, merchants or tradesmen--were\r\nrequired either to turn Christians or to leave the country the very\r\nnext day. They almost all submitted, and received baptism, so that in\r\na short time there were more than twenty churches in the kingdom. God\r\nwrought miracles to confirm the faithful in their belief.”\r\n\r\nAll this time one of the most zealous as well as influential among\r\nthe Christian converts was he who was known as Justo Ucondono, or\r\nTakayama oo konyay no kami. His seat was Takaski, in the province of\r\nSetsu, where “he labored with a zeal truly apostolical to extirpate\r\nthe idolaters out of his states, where the number was now fallen to\r\n30,000. He sent word that they should either receive the faith or be\r\ngone immediately out of his country, for he would acknowledge none for\r\nhis subjects but such as adored the true God. This declaration obliged\r\nthem all to accept of instruction, which cut out work enough for all\r\nthe fathers and missionaries at Meaco.” Taikosama still continued\r\nhis wonted favors to the Christians, “saying one day, in a familiar\r\nway, that he would willingly become a Christian himself if they could\r\ndispense with him in polygamy.” In this way the Roman Catholics set\r\nthe example of intolerance, driving those opposed to them in religious\r\nbelief out of the country. True disciples, and breathing the spirit of\r\nthe Inquisition, then in full blow in Spain and Portugal, they would\r\nnot allow within their own states that freedom under which the tree\r\nplanted by them had taken root and was flourishing.\r\n\r\nTakayama brought over as a convert, among others, the young admiral of\r\nTaikosama’s fleet--Don Austin, as he is known to the Jesuits; Konishi,\r\nSetsu no kami, Yuki Naga, as his title is in native history. He and his\r\nfather and mother were baptized in 1584.\r\n\r\nTaikosama, wishing to keep Takaski, gave Takayama in its stead another\r\nestate, Akashi, in Harima; and as “soon as Justo had taken possession\r\nof it, his first thoughts were to reduce it under the obedience of\r\nChrist. The bonzes, smelling his design, with their idols went to cast\r\nthemselves at the Queen’s feet. The Queen, touched with an ardent\r\nzeal for her religion, spoke to the King in their behalf. But Faxiba,\r\nwho was no bigot, answered her briskly that he had absolutely given\r\nJusto that place in change of Tacacuqui; and for the rest, every\r\none was free to dispose of his own. Let the bonzes, if the idols be\r\ntroublesome, drown them in the sea, or dry them for fuel. Don Justo,\r\nmuch pleased with Faxiba’s answer, took then a resolution to oblige\r\nall his subjects to become Christians,” and thus first taught them\r\na lesson which they afterward practiced upon himself. Justo had the\r\nmerit, in his religious zeal, of being unconnected with any seaport\r\ntown. All the other lords who had been brought over to the Roman\r\nChurch were competing more or less for foreign trade--Boongo, Arima,\r\nOmura, Firando, Grotto; and though some of them seem to have been\r\nsincere converts, others wavered with the rise and fall of exports and\r\nimports. Such, for example, may the King of Boongo be called, when\r\nhe returned the following answer to the bozangs: “These good fathers\r\nhave been thirteen or fourteen years in my kingdom. At their arrival\r\nI had only three kingdoms; they are now swelled to five. My treasury\r\nwas exhausted; it now exceeds any other prince in all Japan. I had no\r\nmale issue to succeed me, but now Heaven has blessed me with heirs.\r\nEverything has succeeded and prospered since they came among us. What\r\nblessing did I ever receive from your gods since I began to serve them?\r\nBegone! and never speak ill those I love and respect.” This Boongo\r\nno kami on one occasion during war destroyed a most prodigious and\r\nmagnificent temple with a colossal statue, burning 3,000 monasteries to\r\nashes. “This ardent zeal of the prince is an evident instance of his\r\nfaith and charity,” says the Jesuit writer.\r\n\r\nThis year, upon the occasion of the arrival of the Father Provincial\r\nof Japan at Osaka, Justo and Austin demanded an audience for him with\r\nTaikosama. “To make the way more easy, he exposed, according to the\r\ncustom of the country, his presents for the King and Queen. He was\r\nintroduced (his majesty accepting the presents) to Taikosama seated\r\non a magnificent throne, and was received by him with the most marked\r\nkindness and condescension. He commended them for taking so long a\r\nvoyage to publish in those parts the law of their God. He gave them\r\nsupper. After the collation he entertained them with a long discourse\r\nabout his government, told them he intended to make one-half of Japan\r\nembrace the Christian religion, and that he had thoughts of passing\r\ninto China, not to pillage and plunder the country, but to reduce it\r\nunder the sweet yoke of his obedience. To this end he intended to put\r\nto sea with a fleet of 200 men-of-war. Moreover (and this is the gist\r\nof the conversation), he desired to hire upon any terms two stout ships\r\nof Portugal, well armed and manned, and by means of the fathers made\r\nhimself sure of gaining this point. After the conquest of China, he\r\nwould build temples to the true God in all the cities and towns through\r\nhis empire, and withal oblige his subjects universally by public edict\r\nto become Christians.\r\n\r\n“He afterward conducted them through his palace to the ninth story of\r\na pyramidal building, whence they had a beautiful view of the country\r\naround Osaka. He then alluded to the famous discussion between F.\r\nFroes and the Buddhist high-priest, saying that at the time he was so\r\nincensed at the brute, the insolent bozang, that if he had been in\r\npower he would have taken off his head.”\r\n\r\nAt this meeting the Provincial put in a petition to Taikosama, which he\r\nis said by the Jesuits to have granted; viz., “That it should be lawful\r\nfor them to preach the law of the true God through all his states, and\r\nhis subjects free to embrace it. That their houses should be exempt\r\nfrom lodging soldiers. That, as strangers, they should be exempt from\r\nall cesses and taxes which the lords do usually lay upon their vassals.\r\nAnd he added to that, that he gave them license to preach, not only in\r\nhis kingdoms, but through all Japan, as lords and sovereigns of the\r\nwhole empire.”\r\n\r\nSuch being the inclinations and views of Taikosama toward the Jesuits\r\nin the outset of his reign, by what means, it may be asked, was he\r\nbrought to a change? The statements of the Jesuits are the sole\r\nauthority for this part of history; but they seem to have played their\r\ncards badly.\r\n\r\n“Religion in Japan within this thirty-eight years past, when St.\r\nFrancis Xaverius sowed, the first seeds in that uncultivated soil,\r\nhas now grown so fair and flourishing that one might well compare it\r\nto an orange tree loaded on all sides with fruits and blossoms. It\r\nwas a field cultivated by the workmen of the vineyard, and watered\r\nwith kindly showers from heaven, which gave fair hope of a rich and\r\nplentiful harvest. It was a ship under full sail drove by the wind of\r\nthe Holy Ghost, discovering daily new places and countries.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1587 they reckoned above 200,000 Christians in Japan,\r\namong whom were several persons of distinguished merit--kings, princes,\r\ngenerals of armies, principal lords of the court, and, in a word, the\r\nflower of the Japonian nobility. Moreover, what by Cambacundono’s\r\n[Taikosama’s] esteem of our religion, and kindness to the missioners\r\nthat preached it, and what by his contempt of the bonzes, whom he\r\npersecuted with fire and sword, burning their temples and pulling down\r\ntheir idols wherever he came--what, also, by vesting the Christian\r\nlords in the most considerable places of the government, and indulging\r\nliberty to all his court to receive baptism, over and above, by\r\nerecting so many churches to the true God, and so particularly\r\ncountenancing the fathers of the Society--the number of them daily\r\nincreased. For, not content with sending frequently for the fathers to\r\nhis palace, he went one day himself to visit the Provincial on board\r\nof his ship, and discoursed him after a familiar way for several hours\r\ntogether. Not that he had any thoughts of religion, for he was so proud\r\nthat he pretended equality with Divinity itself, but by this had a mind\r\nto gain a reputation among the princes of Europe.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, these fair appearances put several of the principal\r\nlords in a humor of being instructed, and the number of the proselytes\r\nwas so great that the fathers could rest neither day nor night.\r\nThey were taken up continually with preaching, baptizing, and\r\ninstructing such as earnestly desired this sacrament, among whom was\r\nCambacundono’s own nephew, a prince about nineteen years of age,\r\npresumptive heir to the crown.\r\n\r\n“While the Church was in this profound peace, the devil, foreseeing\r\nan entire conversion of the whole empire must follow, raised such a\r\nfurious tempest as drove the ship of the Japonian Church upon the\r\nrocks, and split it all to pieces.” So writes one of the Jesuit\r\nfathers. He then looks about to find a reason for the foundering of\r\nthe vessel, and finds it anywhere but in the pilots or officers of the\r\nship. The unlucky merchants, whether the failure be ecclesiastical or\r\npolitical, are sure to be made the first scapegoats. Their lives were\r\nso dissolute that the immaculate Taikosama was horrified. This not\r\nbeing completely satisfactory, it was further found that “the scandal\r\nwas so great that Cambacundono, who had notice of it, began to conceive\r\nan ill opinion of the Christian religion, and concluded the fathers\r\nonly used it for a sconce to some underhand intrigue of reducing the\r\nempire of Japan under the obedience of some Christian prince.” After\r\nthese two preliminary reasons, the father goes on to assign other\r\ncauses. “The first was his pride, which rendered him extremely sensible\r\nof the least contradiction.” At his interview with the Provincial at\r\nOsaka, above narrated, his object was to obtain some large foreign\r\nvessels to transport troops to China. Hearing that one had “arrived\r\nat Firando, he requested it might be sent round to Facata, in Boongo,\r\nthat he might see it. The captain said it was impossible, owing to the\r\ndraught of water of the vessel. Taikosama seemed satisfied, but the\r\nsame night he sent orders to the fathers to depart from Japan within\r\ntwenty days, and forbade them to preach the Gospel on pain of death.”\r\nTo justify himself, he gave out that “he did this because the Christian\r\nfaith was contrary to the received and established religion of Japan,\r\nthat he had long since designed to abolish it, and only deferred the\r\nexecution till he had conquered Ximo [Kiusiu], where the Christians,\r\nbeing so numerous, might have formed a party against him.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” says the father, “the main refusal, we discovered afterward\r\ntwo main reasons that put him upon this edict. The first was a design\r\nof ranking himself among the gods, by which he hoped to make himself be\r\nadored by all his subjects as one of the chief conquerors of Japan. Now\r\nknowing that none but Christians would dare to oppose him, he took a\r\nresolution of exterminating them forthwith before they could have time\r\nto make a party against him.\r\n\r\n“The other cause of his aversion to religion was his own lewd life\r\nand conversation. Because some of the Christian ladies of Arima had\r\nrejected the proposal made by a bozang of entering his service, he\r\nwas enraged against the whole religion, and resolved to be revenged\r\non the whole body of Christians.” This bozang, Jacunin (or Shiaku),\r\nhad probably been a resident on the estate of Takayama, or Justo\r\nUcondono, at Takaski, or at Akashi, and had smarted under the severity\r\nof the treatment by Justo, in turning out of house and home every one\r\nnot of his way of thinking. This priest is said to have directed his\r\nmaster’s wrath against Takayama. “All the forces in the empire being\r\nin his power as general, and he the greatest bigot of the sect, it\r\nwas well if, under the mask of religion, he did not underhand form a\r\nleague against the state.” The consequence was, that a dispatch was\r\nimmediately forwarded to Takayama, confiscating his estate, depriving\r\nhim of his offices, and reducing him at once to beggary. Takayama on\r\nthe occasion seems to have displayed great magnanimity, and acted from\r\na deep Christian feeling. He might have temporized and dallied till the\r\nwrath of Taikosama had cooled down, or he might have committed suicide,\r\nas a native noble would have done, and preserved his name as a hero and\r\nhis estate to his son. After prayer, the whole family--his father and\r\nmother, men, women, children, and servants--immediately put themselves\r\non their way, with what little baggage they could carry. They found a\r\nretreat in the territory of Setsu no kami, Don Austin.\r\n\r\nAt this time Taikosama issued the following proclamation: “Being\r\ninformed by the lords of our Privy Council that certain foreign,\r\nreligious were entered into our states, where they preach a law\r\ncontrary to the established religion of Japan, and impudently presume\r\nto ruin the temples of the Camis and Fotoquis, though this attempt\r\ndeserve the very utmost severity, yet out of our royal clemency we do\r\nonly hereby command them upon pain of death to depart from Japan in\r\ntwenty days, during which time it shall not be lawful for any one to\r\nhurt them; but if afterward any of them shall be found in our states,\r\nour will and pleasure is that they be apprehended and punished as in\r\ncases of high treason. As for the Portuguese merchants, we give them\r\nfree leave to traffic and reside in our ports till further order; but\r\nwithal we do hereby strictly forbid them, on pain of having both their\r\nships and merchandises confiscated, to bring over with them any foreign\r\nreligious.”\r\n\r\nThat this change should sooner or later have come is not to be wondered\r\nat. That it should have shown itself so suddenly is in accordance with\r\nJapanese ideas of policy and the character of the Japanese mind. The\r\nempire had been for years, almost ages, torn by internal divisions\r\namong small chiefs. The object of Nobu nanga had been to bring them all\r\ninto one under himself. His lieutenant, Taikosama, totally illiterate,\r\nthough perhaps not more so than those around him, had been imbued\r\nwith his master’s views. The Buddhist monasteries had been hotbeds\r\nof sedition and foci of disturbance, being at the same time large\r\npolitical and military powers of perhaps the second rank, and they had\r\nmade themselves obnoxious on different occasions by marked insolence\r\nto the generals, and even to Nobu nanga himself. They had not even the\r\njustification of having preserved (as monasteries did of old in Europe)\r\nthe literature of the country, not one priest being able to read, or\r\nteach the rising generation the rudiments of the written character.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jesuits appeared with meek and lowly appearance, Nobu nanga\r\nwas charmed with the prospect of establishing them as a counterpoise\r\nto the haughty and insolent Buddhists. He nourished them, showering\r\nfavors upon them, and in every way encouraging them, more especially\r\nborne, as they were, on the wings of wealth and trade. They found\r\nJapan, so far as religions went, a free country, where all religions\r\nwere tolerated so long as they did not become aggressive. But they did\r\nnot come from a free country. Their ideas were not those of religious\r\ntolerance. By a decree of Gregory XIII., January 28, 1585, all priests\r\nand religious whatever except Jesuits were prohibited from going to\r\npreach in Japan. This was confirmed by Clement VIII., March 14, 1597;\r\nand Philip II. of Spain wrote soon after to his viceroy in the Indies\r\nto see the order punctually obeyed. This monarch was wielding the\r\npower as King of Portugal. No priest could come to Japan without his\r\nsanction. He had the power of putting his veto on the appointments made\r\nby the Pope. The fires of the Inquisition were blazing. The wish of\r\nthe Jesuits was, that those who differed from them in religious views\r\nshould be burned as heretics, to be damned; their hope was that they\r\nthemselves, holding the true faith, might be burned as martyrs, to\r\nbe beatified. Doubtless the archives of Simancas could unfold many a\r\nletter breathing such thoughts written from Japan, possibly noted by\r\nPhilip’s own hand.\r\n\r\nThey had hitherto sailed with a fair wind. It may be believed, without\r\ngoing to the full length of taking everything in their letters for\r\ntruth, or, on the other hand, accepting all that is said against them\r\nin the work “La Morale pratique des Jesuites,” or “L’Esprit de Mons. S.\r\nArnauld,” that they had done some good. Many had been won over from a\r\nstate of brutishness to submission in their daily walk and conversation\r\nto the precepts of the Gospel. Some had gone through severe trials and\r\npersecutions, and had stood firm to their professions. Each of the\r\nlords of Boongo, Arima and Omura had suffered more or less for the\r\nfaith they professed. Though the fathers themselves give us a weapon\r\nto attack their conversions when they at one time assure us that “to\r\nwin the favor of Taikosama put several of the principal lords in a\r\nhumor of being instructed, and the number of proselytes was so great\r\nthat the fathers could not rest day or night preaching, instructing\r\nand baptizing such as earnestly desired this sacrament” (among whom\r\nwas Cambacundono’s own nephew, Hidetsoongo), it might be asked, What\r\nsort of converts were these? and how could these fathers abuse this\r\nsacrament in baptizing persons to win the favor of such a master?\r\n\r\nBut these fathers appear to have looked upon the bozangs as their\r\npersonal enemies. They thought that it was their special mission to\r\nroot them out. They would not let the tares and the wheat, as they\r\nlooked upon the respective parties, grow together. They attacked these\r\npriests wherever they met them. Francis Xavier, at the commencement of\r\nhis missionary life in Japan, visited these “bonzes, with the design,\r\nif it were possible, to convert them to Christ, being persuaded that\r\nChristianity would make little progress among the people if they who\r\nwere generally looked upon as oracles of truth opposed the preaching\r\nof the Gospel.” He declared himself much astonished that in Japan the\r\npeople “have a profound respect for the bonzes; for though they be\r\nconscious of their hypocrisy and debaucheries, yet at the same time\r\nthey worship them like deities, and pay them all imaginable submission.”\r\n\r\nOne of the first duties of a missionary should be to learn thoroughly\r\nthe religion of the people of the country to which he is sent. An\r\nacquaintance with Buddhism, and its tenets and principles, would have\r\nbeen a very powerful weapon to convince or to condemn these priests,\r\nwithout trying to hold them constantly up to the scorn of their own\r\npeople and followers. From the commencement of the Romish missions a\r\ncontinued aggressive action appears to have been kept up against the\r\nBuddhist priesthood as individual men. The lives and the morals, or the\r\nwant of morals, of these men seem to have been the constant theme of\r\nthe Jesuit addresses to the people.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be wondered at that a body which was politically strong\r\nenough to cause uneasiness to the monarch of a country like Japan\r\nshould not sit quietly under such attacks. We have no objection to\r\nyou making converts, they may have said; but when it came to breaking\r\ndown temples and destroying the images, a spirit of intense opposition\r\nwas aroused. But when to this a system of persecution was added--such\r\nas that pursued by Don Justo in his territories, when every one not\r\nof his religion was driven out, when the property of the temples was\r\ntaken from them, and perhaps given to their opponents--only one end\r\ncan be looked for; viz., that one party should be victorious over the\r\nother, and that by a war to the knife, a struggle of life and death.\r\nThe Buddhists were roused. They could live alongside of Confucianism,\r\nor of Taouism in the Yamabooshi, or of the different sects among\r\nthemselves; but with the new sect, this Roman Catholicism, which broke\r\nits neighbor’s temples down, abused him to his face, and then turned\r\nevery one out wherever it had the power of doing so--the only method\r\nwith it was to use its own weapons and turn it out--to root it out of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThis Inquisition mode of dealing could have ended in no other way.\r\nJapan was not Spain, as the Jesuits found out.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhists felt that they were worsted on both sides--by the\r\nmilitary power on the one side, which had defeated their soldiers,\r\nburned their monasteries, confiscated their lands, and appropriated\r\ntheir temples; by the Jesuits, who had seduced their people, abused\r\nthemselves, robbed them of their tithes and offerings, broken down\r\ntheir gods, and burned the temples, and were now attempting to make\r\nconverts in the palace itself, being in such favor as to be received by\r\nTaikosama as he received no other.\r\n\r\nTaikosama was probably a proficient in the Japanese art of dissembling.\r\nAt first he was doubtful to which party to incline; but when he had\r\nonce made sure, after his defeat of the Negoros and seizure of their\r\nterritory in Kii, that the Buddhists were thoroughly subdued, there\r\ncould be little doubt, knowing the man, but that he would not give it\r\nto that which was threatening to be the cause of renewed disturbance\r\nin the empire, and whose emissaries thought they had a right to reprove\r\nhim whenever it pleased them to do so. But it was Japanese policy to\r\nflatter them, to amuse them, to dissemble with them till the moment\r\nof making the spring. Inflamed by the Buddhist priests around him, he\r\nmade up his mind that the new sect must be rooted out. In the year\r\n1586 Nagasaki was taken from the Prince of Omura by Taiko, and made a\r\ngovernment port and property. At that time, native history tells us,\r\nSatsuma and Owotomo were fighting. To this war Taikosama put an end.\r\nSome “battereng,” or padres, came to Tsikuzen to see Taiko. He did not\r\nlike Roman Catholics. He found that two of his own servants were of\r\nthat faith; they were speared at the temple of Hatchimang at Hakazaki.\r\nThe padres were sent away. Thirteen churches were destroyed. At that\r\ntime the province of Tsikuzen belonged partly to Owotomo and partly to\r\nSatsuma. Taikosama took it from both, and gave all Hizen and Tsikuzen\r\nto Nabeshima, formerly a servant of Riozoji, and whose descendants hold\r\nit to this day. He now fixed that Nagasaki was to be the only place\r\nwhere foreign trade was to be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of 1587 caused the greatest dismay in the minds of\r\nthe Christians. The heads of the church determined that they would,\r\nat all hazards, keep their posts. They took refuge in the territories\r\nof Boongo, Arima, Omura, Firando and Amacusa, alleging that they\r\nwere waiting until a ship was ready to take them away. When the time\r\narrived, and the ship ready, the captain excused himself from carrying\r\nthe fathers this year, as his ship was already over-laden, sending a\r\nletter to Taikosama, which did not reach him for several months. He was\r\nvery angry, and took down the churches in the neighborhood of Miako. At\r\nthe same time he ordered Don Austin to exchange his lands near Miako\r\nfor others in Kiusiu.\r\n\r\nA meeting was held in Firando in August, 1587, at which the heads of\r\nthe church decided that the proclamation of Taikosama was not to be\r\nobeyed, but that prayers were to be offered up, and that Christians\r\nwere to keep quiet, in the hope that the storm might blow over.\r\n\r\nThe following character of Taikosama is given by one of the Jesuit\r\nwriters: “He reigned in profound peace, and to conserve it he observed\r\nthese rules in his government. First, After subduing his enemies, and\r\nan act of pardon, he never put any one to death, as Nobu nanga, his\r\npredecessor, had done, who never spared any of the great ones, which\r\nrendered his government odious and cruel; but Taikosama not only spared\r\ntheir lives, but further assigned them sufficient pensions to live on,\r\nwhich made them easy and well content.\r\n\r\n“Secondly, He forbade all quarrels and private heats, on grievous\r\npenalties, and whoever were found transgressing in this kind were\r\npunished with death. If any of these fled, they punished the relations\r\nin his place; and in default of relations, his domestics; and in\r\ndefault of these his next neighbors, who were all crucified for not\r\npreventing the disorder. No doubt great injustice was committed by this\r\nmeans, and several innocent people suffered. But yet the fear of death\r\nmade all zealous and careful to stifle these animosities and heats in\r\ntheir very birth, and forced them to live quiet.\r\n\r\n“Thirdly, Though he was a tyrant, he would have justice done\r\nimmediately on all criminals, without regard to birth, quality,\r\nservices or any alliance whatever; and the party, upon the first\r\nconviction of his crime, was put to death out of hand, though he were\r\none of his own relations and of the very blood-royal itself. He was\r\nmost lewdly addicted to women, nevertheless he pretended that none had\r\na right to use these debauches but himself, and expressly forbade any\r\nof his subjects to keep a concubine.\r\n\r\n“Another means of preventing troubles was to keep both soldiers and\r\ngentry busy employed; for he put them upon building palaces, raising\r\nfortresses, etc., knowing very well that the humor of the great ones is\r\nalways restless and unquiet if their thoughts are not taken up about\r\nother business. As for the soldiers, lest idleness should effeminate\r\nthem, he kept them always employed about his works.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, besides the pensions allowed them for life, he also\r\nmaintained them in the field, which kept them in submission and\r\ndependence. As for kings, lords and governors, he made frequent\r\nalterations and changes to break their measures, and hinder them from\r\ngrowing popular. Above all, he studied the humor and genius of his\r\nsubjects; and if any were found to be of a turbulent nature, he secured\r\nthem, and by that put them out of the possibility of revolt in his\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n“In fine, what rendered his government so peaceable, was his immense\r\ntreasures; for by these riches he bound all his subjects tight to his\r\ninterest, keeping all in hopes, though he never intended them any\r\nfavors. These were his principal ways and means of maintaining peace in\r\nhis governments.”\r\n\r\nA very little consideration of the position in which Taikosama, as\r\nruler of Japan, was standing to these foreigners must lead to the\r\nconclusion that he could take no other step than that which he had\r\ntaken. They had come to the country uninvited. They had found the\r\ncountry in the possession, so to speak, of a religion which had never\r\nshown a persecuting spirit. They had come in their own vessels. From\r\nthe very outset they had displayed a hard, persecuting spirit, with a\r\ntendency to re-embroil the country in war, out of which it was only\r\nnow emerging. They had insisted on every one coming into subjection\r\nto them, with the alternative of leaving house and home in case of\r\nrefusal. They were, as usual, now calling in the assistance of the\r\ntemporal power to force the yoke of their priestly supremacy on the\r\npeople of Japan. Had Taikosama been able to send them away in vessels\r\nof the country, he would no doubt have done so. But having no vessels,\r\nhe gave them the alternative of living peaceably in the country,\r\nor of leaving it. They forced the ruling powers of Japan, by their\r\nencroachments and persecuting system, to retaliate upon themselves, and\r\nthen gloried in considering themselves martyrs. They were, in short,\r\nconstituting themselves and their flocks, over whom they, as priests,\r\nhad no political authority, an _imperium in imperio_. They were\r\nteaching them to be rebels to their own government, and the priests\r\nthemselves were obliged to end in the spirit in which they ought to\r\nhave commenced--a spirit of meekness among their enemies. It would\r\nseem, from old as well as from recent experience, that, for Christians\r\nto live among heathens, it is necessary to have an “exterritoriality”\r\npower; but that is equivalent to saying simply that the Christian power\r\nis the strongest, and it means to enforce what it thinks right.\r\n\r\nAccording to the resolutions of the meeting at Firando, the Roman\r\nCatholics kept quiet and in retirement in the several provinces in\r\nwhich they were settled.\r\n\r\nThe first of the line of Owotomo began as personal servant of Yoritomo;\r\nand a portion of Satsuma’s territory was given to him, after which the\r\nfamily rose to greatness during the wars between the Emperors of the\r\nNorth and South. About 1374 they acquired a large territory in the\r\nnortheast of the island of Kiusiu, covering the whole of Boongo and\r\nparts of Boozen and the adjoining provinces--Tsikugo and Tsikuzen. In\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century this territory included nearly\r\none-half of the island. The family was ruined in the persecution of the\r\nRoman Catholics. The principality of Arima covered, at one time, the\r\ngreater part of the province of Fizen. The territory, as was often the\r\ncase with small proprietors in feudal times, was at different times\r\nenlarged and contracted. Latterly, it seems to have included only the\r\npeninsula on which the town of Simabarra stands, and but little more.\r\n\r\nOmura is the name of a town which stands on the land-locked bay of the\r\nsame name, in the province of Fizen, about twenty miles from Nagasaki;\r\nand the territory held by the lord of that name included a strip of\r\nground round the city, and the greater part of the peninsula on which\r\nNagasaki stands. The family seems to have been an offshoot from Arna,\r\nand never to have been of any great power until the rise of Nagasaki,\r\nwhich no sooner became of any value than it was taken from the lord by\r\nTaikosama, and has ever since remained government property.\r\n\r\nThe lord of Boongo, who had patronized the Jesuit priests (“our\r\nMæcenas,” as they call him), and afterward had been converted and\r\nbaptized, had died in the year 1587. He had abdicated in favor of his\r\nson, but at one time resumed the reins; but before his death had the\r\npain of witnessing the diminution of the family estates by powerful and\r\nrapacious neighbors. His son, after losing part of his estates and the\r\nfavor of Taikosama, thought to regain both by showing some activity\r\nin acting up to the recent proclamation. He was the first to commence\r\nthe persecution of his father’s friends. Meantime, Taikosama returned\r\nto Miako, and seems to have forgotten his edict and the Christians\r\naltogether. Probably the truth is, that during all this time, though he\r\nwas annoyed by the Jesuits and their proceedings, he was working out in\r\nhis own mind the means of making an attack upon China. He saw in the\r\nforeign ships easy means of transport, and, knowing the influence the\r\npriests exerted over the merchants, his hopes lay in keeping in with\r\nthe former to obtain the assistance of the latter in his design. Some\r\ntime after the promulgation of the edict, he received most graciously\r\nFather Valignan, Provincial of Japan and the Indies, as embassador from\r\nthe Viceroy of India, and as associate with the four young embassadors\r\nwho had returned from Europe.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Nagasaki by government in 1590 was a great blow to\r\nthe Jesuits, inasmuch as it had been a source of wealth, through the\r\nlord of Omura, who was a Christian; and also, inasmuch as hitherto the\r\ngovernor had always been a Christian, and he was now exchanged for two\r\nheathens. The place had increased rapidly from the time the Jesuits\r\nfirst went there, probably about 1575, when there were only 500 houses\r\nin the place, till 1590, when there were 5,000 families resident,\r\nbesides merchants and tradesmen who came there in June from all parts\r\non the arrival of the fleets.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1592, Taikosama carried out the project he had long been\r\nthinking on, viz., the invasion of Corea and thence of China, called\r\nin the letters “a foolish and temerarious enterprise, infinitely\r\nhazardous, if not morally impracticable.” It is difficult to see what\r\nmotive existed for this invasion. Being a man of war from his youth,\r\nand knowing nothing else, he perhaps longed for new conquests. The\r\nJesuit writers attribute it to a wish to use up the Christians in the\r\nisland of Kiusiu, as well as to get rid of--Uriah-like--some of the\r\nbest generals of his army, who were believers in the new doctrines.\r\nAnother reason they give was his wish to rival the greatest hero of the\r\nempire, now worshiped as the god of war--Hatchimang--who had conquered\r\nCorea through his mother. He made great preparations, giving out that\r\nhe was going to lead the army himself. He handed over the power he held\r\nin Japan to his nephew, Hidetsoongu, giving him, through the Emperor,\r\nthe title of Kwanbakku. He appointed four generals of the army, two of\r\nwhom were Christians, Don Austin and Kahi no kami, son of Don Simon;\r\nthe two other generals were Toronosuqui and Aki no kami. Under the two\r\nformer were several Christian lords, Arima, Omura, Amacusa, Boongo,\r\nTsussima, Don Austin’s son-in-law, and others, with an army of 40,000\r\nmen. The total number of men collected, including seamen and tradesmen,\r\nwas said to have been 300,000, a large number to supply with food, and\r\nonly possible with an army fed nearly wholly upon rice. One-half of the\r\narmy, after a council of war, set sail from Nangoya in Fizen, and was\r\nlanded at Fusancay or Fkusan, at the southern extremity of Corea. Don\r\nAustin commanded this division. In no long time he repeatedly defeated\r\nthe Corean army and captured several fortresses. Taikosama ordered\r\nToronosuqui and his half of the army to follow into Corea without\r\ndelay. He came up to the support of Don Austin, but, according to the\r\nJesuits’ account, treacherously held back his men that Don Austin\r\nmight be defeated before he came to his support. The Coreans seem to\r\nhave shown no capacity for war, and in no long time nearly the whole\r\nfortresses of the kingdom were in possession of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nTaikosama, according to the Roman Catholic authorities, still jealous\r\nof the body of Christians, especially after Don Austin’s success,\r\ncollected 150,000 men out of Kiusiu, and sent them over to Corea,\r\nordering the commander-in-chief to return the vessels immediately in\r\norder that he might follow in the spring. This is said to have been a\r\nruse to shut off their return.\r\n\r\nMeantime the large force in Corea was being neglected; they were left\r\nwithout provisions or ammunition. Their men, deserting, were taken and\r\nkilled, and at length Don Austin was forced to fall back, and, after\r\nseveral engagements, signed an agreement with the Coreans by which the\r\nlatter were to send two embassadors to Taikosama, and the Japanese\r\nwere to retire, and only to occupy twelve forts on the sea-coast.\r\nThe Japanese army was computed to have lost 150,000 men. A truce\r\nwas concluded, and embassadors accompanied Don Austin to Japan. The\r\nfollowing demands were made: 1. That eight provinces of Corea be handed\r\nover to Japan; 2. That the Emperor of China give one of his daughters\r\nto Taikosama; 3. That there should be a free trade between the two\r\ncountries, and that China and Corea should pay Japan a yearly tribute.\r\n\r\nIn 1592, Lupus di Liano, a Spanish envoy, was dispatched from Manila to\r\nlay complaints against the Portuguese before Taikosama. He was lost on\r\nhis return with the vessel in which he sailed.\r\n\r\nIn 1593 the governor of the Philippines sent over another envoy. He\r\ntook over with him four religious Recollects of St. Francis. These were\r\nthe first arrivals in Japan of any other order not of the Jesuit, with\r\nthe exception of one Dominican, who accompanied the previous Spanish\r\nenvoy. Among the presents was a Spanish horse richly harnessed. Among\r\nthe presents brought by Father Valignan had been an Arab horse. The\r\nblood of these presents has probably influenced the breed in Japan.\r\n\r\nAt an interview with Taikosama these Franciscans asked to see his\r\npalace. “With all my heart, provided you do not preach in my states.”\r\nThe religious, being resolved not to obey him, gave no promise, but\r\nmade a low reverence. Shortly after, the governor of Miako sent to the\r\nJesuit fathers to tell them to go on with their work of piety, but with\r\nprivacy and prudence. In consequence of this they hired a house and\r\nmet privately, none appearing in public except two. “But the fathers\r\nof St. Francis thought not themselves obliged to such condescendence.\r\nTheir ardent zeal made them believe that such deference to the order of\r\nthe sovereign was contrary to the liberty of the Gospel, and that they\r\nought to preach the faith despite of all laws to the contrary.” They\r\nwent to Taikosama and asked for some place away from secular people\r\nto build a little house for their own private convenience. He did not\r\ncarry his edict into execution against them, but referred them to the\r\ngovernor of Miako, who assigned “them a very sweet seat without the\r\nwalls of Miako, commanding that they should neither preach nor hold\r\nassemblies of Christians, according to Taikosama’s orders. But the\r\nfathers, without regard to either the governor’s advice or Taikosama’s\r\norders, built immediately both a church and a convent with a wall about\r\nit. Even the wise and more prudent among the Christians advised them to\r\nbe seriously careful of what they were doing. The governor, hearing of\r\nit, sent and requested them to shut up their church.” He was obliged\r\nto inform Taikosama, saying, “He feared that these religious, who call\r\nthemselves embassadors from the Philippines, intend to preach like the\r\nrest.” “They won’t,” replied he, in a passion, “if they be wise; for if\r\nthey do, I’ll teach them to laugh at me.”\r\n\r\nThese Franciscans, thinking they were most successful, wrote to Manila\r\nfor others to come over to assist them. They opened a church at Osaka,\r\nand designed to erect a third at Nagasaki. To this end they desired\r\nthe governor would obtain leave of Taikosama for two sick to change\r\nair. The governor said in case of health they were free to go where\r\nthey pleased. Upon this two went to Nagasaki, and began to say mass and\r\npreach publicly without any regard to the Emperor’s mandates.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits were much surprised that these Franciscan fathers should\r\nfix a residence in their jurisdiction without their consent; while\r\nthe lieutenant-governor, having received strict orders not to permit\r\nany service in the town, was in doubts what to do. He referred to the\r\ngovernor, and he, being alarmed for himself, ordered a note to be taken\r\nof every one who disobeyed the law, but said he would apply for further\r\ninstructions to Taikosama himself. Hearing from Miako that these men\r\nhad asked and received permission to go to Nagasaki on the plea of\r\nsickness only, he ordered them out of his jurisdiction, which seems to\r\nbe a very lenient course of treatment, considering the trouble that had\r\nalready arisen out of this preaching.\r\n\r\nThe success of Konishi (Don Austin) in Corea seems at first to have\r\noperated in his favor. Taikosama was delighted; but as soon as this\r\nfirst feeling was over, alarm at thinking he was a Christian, and as\r\nsuch could command the services of a very large body of his countrymen\r\nat a word from the Jesuit priests, seems to have been the most\r\nprominent feeling in his mind. He knew by experience that the Buddhist\r\npriests had been able to keep the armies of Nobu nanga at bay for\r\nseveral years. He therefore dissembled, and in the meantime he recalled\r\nJusto to court, and gave him a large pension.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, another circumstance occurred which occupied\r\nhis mind for a time. Hidetsoongu, his nephew, had been acknowledged as\r\nheir, and power was delegated to him as regent while Taiko should be\r\naway in Corea. Of this young man a somewhat extraordinary account is\r\ngiven in the Jesuit letters. In 1587, when Taiko chose to make a great\r\nshow of favor to the Roman Catholics and the missionaries, the fathers\r\nwere taken up continually with preaching, baptizing and instructing\r\nsuch of the principal lords as desired earnestly this sacrament, among\r\nwhom was Taiko’s own nephew, and presumptive heir to the crown.\r\n\r\n“Hidetsoongu was a young man of three-and-thirty years of age, endowed\r\nwith all the qualifications that can be desired in a young prince. He\r\nhad a quick and penetrating wit, an excellent judgment, and withal\r\na most courteous and obliging behavior. He was wise, prudent and\r\ndiscreet. He abhorred the vices of his country and loved learning, and\r\ntook pleasure in it. For this reason he was delighted in the company of\r\nthe fathers, and knowing that our religion set value on virtue and good\r\nmanners, he took a particular affection to it.\r\n\r\n“But all these good qualities were quite obscured by a strange and\r\nmost inhuman vice. He took a strange kind of pleasure and diversion in\r\nkilling men, insomuch that when any one was condemned to die, he chose\r\nto be executioner himself. He walled in a place near his palace, and\r\nset in the middle a sort of table for the criminal to lie on till he\r\nhewed him to pieces. Sometimes, also, he took them standing, and split\r\nthem in two. But his greatest satisfaction was to cut them off limb by\r\nlimb, which he did as exactly as one can take off the leg or wing of\r\na fowl. Sometimes, also, he set them up for a mark, and shot at them\r\nwith pistols and arrows. But what is most horrid of all, he used to rip\r\nup women with child to see how the infants lay in their mother’s womb.\r\nFather Froes, who had seen and conversed with him, describes him as you\r\nhave seen.” This account is corroborated by native history.\r\n\r\nFor many years Hidetsoongu had been looked upon as his uncle’s heir.\r\nHe had three children; but about this time one of Taiko’s wives had a\r\nson, who was thought by many to be supposititious. “Be it as it will,”\r\nwrite the fathers, “he made great rejoicing for it all over Japan, and\r\ninsisted on his nephew adopting the child as his son.”\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that uncle and nephew became jealous and\r\ndistrustful each of the other. In the “History of the Church” a full\r\naccount is given of their meetings in Miako. “Taikosama sent to his\r\nnephew to say he would invest him with full power. Hidetsoongu prepared\r\na magnificent feast. The day was settled, but the uncle was afraid\r\nto trust himself within the palace of Juraku, where the nephew was\r\nwaiting for him. At last he was persuaded to go, and went with great\r\nmagnificence in a triumphal chariot (a closed box) all laid with gold,\r\ndrawn by two large oxen with gilt horns. The procession lasted from\r\nmorning till two in the afternoon. All this time Taiko minded more\r\nthe security of his own person than all the entertainments. He placed\r\nguards all about his apartments, and advised his nephew to lodge in\r\nanother palace. The nobility generally believed that Hidetsoongu would\r\nnever let slip so fair an opportunity of avenging the injuries he had\r\nreceived, and therefore every one took care of himself. But no attempt\r\nwas made on Taiko’s life. Appearances were kept up for some days; but\r\nthe nephew, disgusted with his uncle’s treatment, secretly began to\r\nmake the preparations which had been expected of him long before.” But\r\nhe was betrayed by the first of the nobles to whom he applied--probably\r\nMowori (known as Choshiu), who gave Taiko information. In no long\r\ntime Taiko brought the matter to a point by asking explicit answers\r\nto plain questions, and in the meantime collected troops about Miako.\r\nWhen he thought he was safe, he sent to his nephew and ordered him off\r\ninstanter to his father’s territory. He was then ordered to enter the\r\nmonastery of Koga, used as a retreat by exiled nobles. He marched,\r\naccordingly, all night. The prisoner was treated as badly as possible;\r\nand in August, 1795, an order came from his uncle that he and his\r\nservants should rip themselves up. Hidetsoongu paid the last attention\r\none friend can pay to another in Japan, and cut their heads off after\r\nthey had stabbed themselves. He himself repeatedly stabbed himself, and\r\none of his esquires took his master’s saber and cut off his head, and\r\nthen stabbing himself, fell on his body. Father Froes seems to have\r\nbeen on the spot at the time.\r\n\r\nTaikosama, in the whole of this affair, showed a spirit of extreme\r\ncruelty and vindictiveness. He, not satisfied with the life of his\r\nnephew, put to death all his friends, and then, collecting his family,\r\nsent his wives and children, the eldest five years of age, his own\r\ngrand nephews and nieces, to execution; with savage atrocity sending\r\nfor his nephew’s head that it might be shown to them at the scaffold.\r\nThey were all beheaded to the number of thirty-one ladies and three\r\nchildren, and their bodies thrown into a hole in Sanjio Street, over\r\nwhich a sort of erection or tomb was built, and on it the inscription,\r\nTchikushozuka, “The tomb of bitches,” which remains to this day. A\r\ntemple has been built close by, and is named Tchikushozuka no dera.\r\n\r\nTaikosama had long set his heart upon the hope of prevailing upon\r\nthe Emperor of China to send an embassy to Japan, and, to his own\r\nsurprise, his ambition was gratified. Don Austin, according to Jesuit\r\naccounts, by working upon the fears of the officers of the Celestial\r\ncourt, induced them to send two men to Corea, who were ordered to pass\r\nover into Japan. Taikosama made preparations to receive this embassy\r\nwith great magnificence, but in the end treated the envoys with marked\r\ninsolence and rudeness.\r\n\r\nIn August of 1596 a comet was visible for fifteen days in Japan, and on\r\nthe 30th of the same month a frightful earthquake is recorded to have\r\noccurred. By this the greater part of the buildings recently erected\r\nat great expense at Osaka and Fusimi were completely demolished.\r\nRecurring at midnight of the 1st of September with awful violence, all\r\nthe magnificent buildings raised by the Taiko were in a moment thrown\r\ndown--two lofty eight-storied buildings, visited by the fathers, being\r\ndestroyed. Stones, each of which had required the united efforts of\r\n1,500 men to put in their places, were hurled out. The heavy roofs of\r\ntemples and buildings, subsiding _en masse_, buried many under them,\r\nand, as usual in Japan, the fires which arose carried death to those\r\nburied under the wood. The occasion is used by one of the fathers, in\r\nhis letter, to indulge in a sneer against the Buddhist priesthood. In\r\ndoing so, he gives some insight into the tenets inculcated in their\r\nsermons by these Buddhist priests. “He was preaching on the evening\r\nprior to the earthquake with such a torrent of eloquence as to bear\r\nall before him, and the main drift of his discourse was the mercy\r\nand bounty of his god toward his clients, particularly at the hour\r\nof death. He enlarged upon his charity to mankind, showing that he\r\nwould have all men to be saved, without distinction or exception of\r\npersons, exhorting them to cast themselves on his mercy. So soon as\r\nhe had made an end of speaking, the people cried out with a general\r\nvoice, ‘Our god, be merciful to us!’ But Amida was probably asleep,\r\nfor that very night the temple fell to the ground, the idol was\r\nbroken, and the preacher narrowly escaped with his life.” By this\r\nconvulsion the immense copper figure of Buddha at Miako was broken. The\r\nJesuit accounts state that seventy women about the palace at Fusimi\r\nwere killed, the Taiko himself narrowly escaping to a mountain top,\r\nwhere he dwelt in a reed hut, for fear of being swallowed up in the\r\nchasms of the earth. Saccay, the richest and most voluptuous city of\r\nJapan, suffered, at the same time, greatly from one of those fearful\r\nincursions of the sea consequent upon a temporary depression or bending\r\ndownward of the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Taikosama’s passion began to cool, and the fathers\r\n“had grounds to hope that religion would be re-established, as he\r\nwas rather pleased at their obeying his edict, and keeping quiet in\r\ndeference to his wishes.” He still took pleasure in occasionally\r\nreceiving the bishop, and winked at the fathers remaining in the\r\ncapital. But when everything was again promising of fair wind, another\r\nstorm arose, and again the origin is attributed by the Jesuits, not\r\nto the Japanese, but to the same Franciscan fathers who had recently\r\narrived from Manila. The Jesuits’ letters say, “The Recollects of the\r\nregular observance of St. Francis, who were lately settled at Miako,\r\nbeing now conversant in the language of the country, began to preach\r\npublicly in the churches, to hear confessions and baptize the infidels,\r\nwithout any regard to the Emperor’s orders. Had religion been on\r\nthe same footing as heretofore, the zeal and labor of these holy\r\nmen would have wrought wonders, but the design was so ill-concerted\r\nat this juncture, that, instead of reaping any advantage by it, as\r\nwas expected, it drew a bloody persecution both upon themselves and\r\nthe other Christians. For being newly established in Japan, little\r\nacquainted with the genius of the people, and less with Taikosama’s\r\ndesigns, they gave full scope to their zeal without regard to the\r\nEmperor’s threats, or even to the advice of their friends, who\r\ncounseled them all along to act in concert with the other religious,\r\nwho by their prudence and wise conduct had counted so many thousands\r\nof souls in this mission. But nothing was able to stop this torrent\r\nof zeal. Designing well, they believed themselves obliged to overlook\r\nall human respects, and this persuasion made them jealous of friends’\r\nadvice as savoring of jealousy and envy. The Christians, not at all\r\nsatisfied with their conduct, begged of them to moderate their zeal;\r\nbut being men that undervalued their lives, and in a persuasion\r\nthat the Emperor would never offer any rudeness to persons of their\r\ncharacter that bore the name of embassadors from one of the greatest\r\nmonarchs of the world, they continued their functions with new fervor\r\nand zeal. The natives said, ‘These men neither regard our counsel nor\r\nthe Emperor’s orders, but one day they’ll repent it.’”\r\n\r\nBut still, notwithstanding these infractions of the recently published\r\nedict, there was no ill-will shown to these men. Four new governors\r\nof state had been appointed. These governors, hearing of the friars’\r\nrashness, sent to them privately to admonish them of their danger,\r\ntelling them that if it came to Taiko’s ears he would certainly put\r\nthem all to death. This information only added new life and vigor\r\nto their zeal, so desirous were they of suffering martyrdom for\r\nChrist. The viceroy sent for two of these friars to the palace, and\r\nreprimanded them severely for slighting the Emperor’s desires. This\r\nnotwithstanding, they went on with their functions. The superior of\r\nthe Jesuits, F. Organtin, hearing of those complaints by the governor,\r\nas well as the Christians and heathens, sent to Friar Baptist to lay\r\nbefore him the danger himself and his family, as well as the whole\r\nChurch of Japan, was in if he did not (so far as reason, conscience\r\nand zeal of God’s glory would permit) study to give the governor\r\nsatisfaction, and yield a little to the times. “I do not find,” says\r\nthe writer, “what answer was given, but this is certain, they both\r\npreached and administered the sacraments after that more publicly than\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nThese men, under the quality of embassadors, had come to the country,\r\nand under the same name were remaining in Japan to insult the supreme\r\npower, and to irritate the government into taking the only means in its\r\npower of supporting its own dignity; viz., putting them out of the way.\r\n“Guenifoin” (probably Kio no kami, or governor of Miako), “who had all\r\nalong favored the Christians, foreseeing the ill-consequences of this\r\nrefractory humor, suspended still the execution of his threats, and did\r\nnot so much as hint at it either to the court. However, the business\r\nwas discovered at last, and the friars were betrayed by their friend\r\nFaranda, the person who invited them over from the Philippines.” They\r\nintrigued with this man, who seems to have used his knowledge of the\r\nSpanish language and his acquaintance with the Roman fathers of the\r\nChurch for his own advancement. “At first they had some difficulty in\r\naccepting his invitation (in the name of Taikosama) to visit Japan,\r\nas contrary to the decree of Gregory XIII. forbidding all priests\r\n(the Society excepted) to preach in Japan. All the able men whom they\r\nconsulted agreed that embassadors were not included in this decree; and\r\nSextus Quintus having given leave to the religious of St. Francis to\r\npreach the Gospel through the East Indies, the islands of Japan fell in\r\ncourse as part of the whole.”\r\n\r\nThe conduct of these men would in any country have exposed them to the\r\nnotice of the government. There is little need for drawing into the\r\nquestion of the treatment of these embassadorial fathers the conduct\r\nof the captain of a rich Spanish galleon wrecked upon the southern\r\ncoast of Sikok. This man lost his ship, and the treasures were seized\r\nby Taikosama. “Upon being examined, he pointed out on a map the\r\nterritories belonging to the King of Spain, and added that the way\r\nin which he obtained such extensive possessions was by first sending\r\nmissionaries; and so soon as they had gained a sufficient number of\r\nproselytes, the King followed with his troops, and, joining the new\r\nconverts, made a conquest of the kingdoms.”\r\n\r\nUpon the conduct of these Franciscan fathers being brought to the\r\nnotice of Taikosama, he at once ordered them to be executed. At first\r\nthe Jesuits thought that all Christians were included in this order;\r\nbut the Giboo no sho wrote to Nagasaki to the governor, in the name of\r\nTaikosama, to see that no affront was offered to the Jesuits, whom he\r\nwas pleased to have reside there on condition that they did not preach,\r\nor baptize, or hold assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe Father Provincial of the Jesuits, considering this condition\r\nopposed to the law of God, resolved to take no notice of it, but wrote\r\nto those under him to extend the empire of Christ, but still by such\r\nways and means as might not give the Emperor cause of complaint. These\r\nfive Franciscans were sent down from Miako to Nagasaki to be there\r\nexecuted, under the following sentence:\r\n\r\n“Seeing that these men have come from the Philippine Islands in the\r\nquality of embassadors, yet have continued residing at Miako to spread\r\nthe Christian law, which I some years ago prohibited, I command that\r\nall of them, together with those Japanese who have enrolled themselves\r\nunder this law, be arrested, and let the whole twenty-four undergo\r\nthe punishment of the cross at Nagasaki. And once more I prohibit the\r\nforesaid doctrine in time to come. Let all know this, and, further,\r\nthat it be carried into execution. But if any one will not obey my\r\nedict, he, with all his family, shall be punished.”\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the cross is inflicted by tying the criminal to a\r\ncross and transfixing the lungs and heart with two sharp spears. The\r\ntwenty-four were thus executed at Nagasaki on February 5, 1597. The\r\nreligious of St. Francis, together with the three Jesuits, were all\r\nplaced in the Catalogue of Saints by Urban VIII., in the year 1627.\r\n\r\nThese men were punished by the Taiko not on account of their religion,\r\nbut as contumelious persons, defying his laws. He appreciated the\r\nbenefits of foreign trade, he valued the presents brought to him,\r\nand he admired the learning of the Jesuits; but he now saw a new\r\ndoctrine being adopted by his subjects which would tolerate no\r\nother near it. The followers of this doctrine were becoming a great\r\npolitical power in the state, and more particularly in Simo or\r\nKiusiu. Several of his principal military officers adhered to this\r\nnew sect. Some of the highest nobles in the land had, according to\r\nthe accounts of the Jesuits, favored it. The bishop, to whom no\r\ndoubt extraordinary external reverence would be shown by the Roman\r\nCatholics, was an occasional visitor at Taikosama’s court. F. Rodriguez\r\nwas apparently in constant attendance as interpreter. The desire to\r\ncontinue to participate in the advantages of foreign trade was being\r\ncounterbalanced by the probable dangers of the ascendency of such a\r\npower in the state, and Taikosama was becoming alarmed. There was\r\na strong party opposed to the Roman Catholics--those who had been\r\nexpelled from their lands, or who had been obliged to conform to retain\r\nthem; those who were envious or jealous of the rise of such men as\r\nKonishi from a comparatively low position to a high military command;\r\nthe priests, whose flocks were being withdrawn, and their incomes\r\nthereby diminished; and all that numerous class whose interests are on\r\nthe side of things remaining as they are--all these were pressing that\r\nsomething should be done to overthrow the political structure which\r\nthese foreigners were attempting to raise.\r\n\r\nDuring the life of Taikosama these men, with their native associates,\r\nwere the only sufferers for disobedience to his edict.\r\n\r\nWhile Taikosama seemed every day becoming more timid and afraid of\r\nwhat steps might be taken by the Christian party, an embassy arrived\r\nfrom Manila, to whose demand he replied that “he put to death the\r\nFranciscans because they preached the Christian religion in his empire\r\ncontrary to his express command.” But he did not pursue his harsh\r\nmeasures any further. He wished to get rid of such disturbers of the\r\nempire; and “hearing that Spain and Portugal were now under one prince,\r\nhe became jealous to the last degree that the Jesuits of these two\r\nnations concerted together, under the color of religion, to bring Japan\r\nunder the same yoke.” He determined, therefore, while all the Christian\r\nprinces were in Corea, to send away by ship all the foreign priests.\r\nBut still he allowed a few to remain in Nagasaki, on condition that\r\nthey did not stir out of town, nor preach.\r\n\r\nHe ordered Terasawa, governor of Nagasaki, to assemble all the Jesuits\r\nand ship them off by the first convenience to China. This, in truth,\r\nseems to have been the only resource left to him if he wished to\r\nretain the government of the country, or to preserve it from once more\r\nundergoing all the horrors of a civil war. If he had heard of the\r\ndoings of Philip II. in the Netherlands during the few years since\r\nthe first arrival of these foreign priests in Japan, he might have\r\nlearned lessons of more decided measures for refractory subjects, and\r\nhave carried out his wishes in ridding Japan of them by a more summary\r\nmethod of persecution.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1598 Taikosama was attacked by dysentery, and\r\nwas so ill that his life was despaired of. His son (real or supposed)\r\nwas then about six years of age. He saw that, in all probability, the\r\npower, after leaving his own hands, would fall into those of Iyeyas,\r\nnow ruler of the eight provinces around Yedo. He therefore determined\r\nto strike up a family alliance between his son and the granddaughter of\r\nIyeyas, thinking he would thereby induce the latter to throw his whole\r\nweight into the scale on behalf of his own grandchild and her husband,\r\nand that thus the power would descend to his own family. The marriage\r\nwas immediately celebrated; and Iyeyas swore that he would turn the\r\ngovernment over to Taiko’s son so soon as he was able to rule by\r\nhimself. Still further to strengthen the party of his son, he appointed\r\nfive governors of the country (as Gotairo), and four others, to be\r\nabout the boy, with instructions to obey Iyeyas, to acknowledge his\r\nson as sovereign so soon as he came of age, to continue all the lords\r\nin their places as he had appointed, and to oppose all innovations on\r\nthe laws now established. To strengthen the position of his son still\r\nfurther, he appointed boards of officers, Tchiuro and Goboonyo, or five\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\nOn his deathbed, such little animosity as he may have had toward the\r\nforeign priests seems to have been mitigated, as he sent for, or\r\nallowed, Father Rodriguez to visit him, when he thanked the father\r\nfor the trouble he had taken in visiting him in health as well as in\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nA temporary amendment enabled him to rouse himself, when his chief\r\nthoughts ran upon strengthening the citadel of Osaka, where 17,000\r\nhouses were pulled down to build the wall, which was a league in\r\ncircuit. He only survived a few days, dying upon September 15, 1598;\r\nall his nobility, according to the fathers, “being much better pleased\r\nto see him on the list of dead gods than in the land of living men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF IYEYAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the removal of Taikosama, the hopes of the Roman Catholic party\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nOnce more the keystone of the arch was removed, and the ordinary\r\ninstitutions of the country were found unequal to the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe deceased ruler had foreseen this, and had made such arrangements\r\nas he could to strengthen the position of his young son. He foresaw\r\nthat Iyeyas was the man of the future; the man most fitted by talent,\r\nmilitary capacity, and position to take the reins. He therefore tried\r\nto bind him by ties of marriage, as well as by oaths, to support\r\nthe youthful inheritor of power. He had, as one of his methods of\r\ngoverning, induced or compelled the nobles to lavish large sums of\r\nmoney in presents to himself, in keeping up large retinues, in making\r\nexpensive journeys between their country residences and the capital,\r\nand in building palaces in the two cities of Osaka and Fusimi. By these\r\nmeans the nobles were impoverished. They could not afford to keep many\r\narmed followers. Mowori of Nagato had been lately compelled to give\r\nup some of his territories, and to pay his respects at the court.\r\nSatsuma had suffered during the recent wars in Kiusiu. Iyeyas alone\r\nhad kept aloof from Taikosama. He had kept his court and established\r\nhimself at Yedo, where he was allowed to remain undisturbed, an\r\nobject of jealousy as well as of fear. Still he seems to have been\r\noccasionally about the court of Taikosama, as he is mentioned in one of\r\nthe letters as being present at the meeting of Taiko and his nephew.\r\nHe perhaps kept Taikosama’s mother still as a hostage in Yedo. Each\r\nof these potentates, in all probability, knew and read the other’s\r\nthoughts--each thinking that the territories and the position of both\r\nwould fall into the hands of the longest liver. The most dissembling\r\nare often the most credulous, and Taikosama was catching at a straw\r\nwhen he summoned Iyeyas to his deathbed. Iyeyas had refused to visit\r\nhim on a former occasion without a hostage in the person of his mother.\r\nOn this occasion he came, but, no doubt, with sufficient precautions.\r\nHe saw that a political crisis was impending, and he knew that the\r\nfruit he had long waited for was falling into his hands. There was\r\nlittle reason now why he should not seize it.\r\n\r\nThe only persons who seem not to have descried the change that was at\r\nhand were the Roman Catholic fathers. By their own letters they do\r\nnot appear to have paid any court to the sun rising in the east. No\r\nmissions are mentioned to Yedo, or in the Kwanto; no interpreter is\r\nsent to the court of Iyeyas; no conversions are spoken of there as in\r\nMiako and the west; and no priests were located there, who might have\r\nbeen acceptable if they had been able to speak in the dialect of the\r\neastern provinces. The Jesuit fathers, up to this time, had rarely\r\nmentioned any of the provinces east of Mino or Owarri.\r\n\r\nThe Taiko had put to death his nephew, who was of an age fit to have\r\nheld the reins after his departure. He left, as successor, Hideyori, a\r\nchild of six years of age. The general belief was that this child was\r\nnot the son of Taiko, but he himself appears to have firmly regarded\r\nhim as such. Recollecting his own origin and rise to the pinnacle\r\nof power, and knowing the turbulent spirits among the lords, his\r\ncountrymen, whom he had all his life long been trying to curb, it is\r\nlittle wonder that he felt uneasy at the prospect opening up to this\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits of this time write: “As to religion, there were all the\r\ngrounds in the world to believe it in a fair way of being established\r\nin Japan. So many potent kings and general officers being all\r\nChristians at the head of a victorious army, and masters of Simo\r\n(Kiusiu), where the inhabitants had all embraced the faith, it was\r\nonly prudence in the regents (the Gotairo), who were divided among\r\nthemselves, to keep fair with them. Above all, Samburandono (Sanhoshi),\r\ngrandson and heir of Nobu nanga, having lately professed himself a\r\nChristian, it was probable the Christians and malcontents would join in\r\nthese divisions, and put him in possession of his ancient rights, which\r\nthe late Taikosama had unjustly usurped. The faithful began to breathe\r\nafter the tyrant’s death.”\r\n\r\nProbably the conversion of Sanhoshi (if true) to the Christian side\r\nblinded these fathers to the weakness of his claims, and to the weight,\r\npower, and talents of Iyeyas. The claims of Sanhoshi and Hideyori\r\nwere equally weak. Both were the heirs of men who had risen from\r\ncomparatively low rank and seized the coveted position, which had been\r\nhereditary in the families of their predecessors, but which, having\r\nbeen held by these men, their fathers, respectively one after the\r\nother, could not be said to be in their families hereditary.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by the Gotairo, or five governors appointed by\r\nTaikosama before his death, who now assumed the power in the name of\r\nHideyori, was the recall of the army from Corea, showing how much the\r\nwhole expedition depended upon the will of the one man, and with how\r\nlittle favor it was regarded by the people of Japan. This brought back\r\nto the island of Kiusiu a strong re-enforcement of Christians with\r\nDon Austin at their head; and his bitter foe, Toronosuqui, the strong\r\nopponent of the Roman Catholic party.\r\n\r\nIn the letters written by the Jesuits at this period, the Taiko had\r\ngenerally been spoken of as the Emperor, and very rarely is any notice\r\ntaken of the real Emperor, then living at Miako. Still less notice is\r\naccorded to the Shiogoon, Yoshitaru, who was then living at Miako, and\r\nholding the highest hereditary office that could be held by a subject.\r\nHe was of the Ashikanga family, and, so long as he lived, neither\r\nNobu nanga nor Taikosama could hold this office. In 1597 he died, and\r\nthe office, which in the family had become an empty title, was not\r\nconferred on any of his relations. The family is still represented\r\nby individuals at Miako, who, though receiving some privileges, live\r\nin poverty and obscurity. The death of this man, and the cessation\r\nof the hereditary claim to the office, opportunely opened to Iyeyas\r\nthe prospect of combining once more the chief power with the highest\r\nhereditary office in the state.\r\n\r\nThe year 1599 is given, in the native annals, as the first year in\r\nwhich the English and Dutch ships visited Japan (they are said to\r\nhave come to the town of Saccay, near Osaka). Dutch pilots had been\r\nnavigating those seas during several years past; some of the accounts\r\ngiven by Linschoten being the results of observations by Dutchmen.\r\nWilliam Adams, the English pilot of the Dutch fleet of five sail, which\r\nleft the Texel on June 24, 1598, did not reach Boongo till April, 1600,\r\nwith only nine or ten men surviving out of the crew, and these nearly\r\nworn out with scurvy and privations. He was taken to Osaka, where he\r\nhad an interview with Iyeyas, who was much pleased with him; but the\r\njealousy of the Portuguese was roused, and they tried to instill into\r\nthe ears of those to whom they had access malicious reports against\r\nthese newcomers.\r\n\r\nMeantime, it was impossible that affairs should continue long peaceably\r\non the present critical footing. The Jesuits, however, were elated\r\nwith the appearance of things. “(Gieiaso) Iyeyas ko,[3] now called\r\nDaifusama” (another name for Nai dai jin), “spoke favorably of\r\nreligion, giving them leave to exercise their religion at Nagasaki, so\r\nthat every one thought the Society re-established in the exercise of\r\nher functions.\r\n\r\n“However, it was not long before the governors fell at variance among\r\nthemselves--Jiboo no sho and Asano dan jo in the first place. The\r\ngrudge between them was of an early date, but the office now held by\r\nboth induced them to come to a kind of agreement. A like dissension\r\nhappened among the lieutenant-generals in Corea about the late treaty\r\nof peace, and the differences ran so high that each took opposite sides\r\non their return home--Don Austin and his followers with Jiboo no sho,\r\nand the rest with Asano dan jo. Several of the lords and Daifusama\r\nhimself labored hard to compose the difference, and at last sentence\r\nwas given in favor of Jiboo no sho and his party. Asano resolved to\r\nright himself by the sword, and in a short time many lords came over\r\nto his party. Don Austin, with Arima, Omura, Satsuma, Tchikugo, and\r\nTerazawa, stuck close to the interest of Jiboo no sho. But what set\r\nthe whole kingdom in a flame was a misunderstanding between Jiboo no\r\nsho and Daifusama, the regent of the empire. The former charged Iyeyas\r\nwith assuming an air of authority, and with secret practices, as if\r\nhe intended to make himself master of the imperial domain. Iyeyas\r\nanswered these complaints of the governors with a great deal of modesty\r\nand calmness, and, in the main, gave a fair account of his conduct. But\r\nfinding that his opponents were levying troops, he gathered an army of\r\n30,000 men out of his own states to prevent a surprise.\r\n\r\n“The nobility were then all at court, part at Fusimi and part at Osaka,\r\nabout the young prince. But seeing war declared between Jiboo no sho\r\nand the regent, every one armed himself and his followers, until they\r\nreckoned in the two towns 200,000 combatants, besides inhabitants. The\r\nstreets swarmed with soldiers, and nothing was looked for but a grand\r\nmassacre. But it being enacted that whoever first broke the peace\r\nshould be declared an enemy to the state, it was each one’s business to\r\nkeep from hostilities. In this manner they continued for some months\r\nin the same town, and not a stroke on either side. At last Daifusama\r\nbeing much superior to his adversary (whom most deserted to serve the\r\nregent), he sent to him to rip up his belly for the public good.\r\n\r\n“Don Austin, who joined interest with Jiboo no sho (otherwise Ishida\r\nmitzu nari), knew very well that would not serve Daifusama’s turn,\r\nunless, at the same time, he could involve the rest of his party in the\r\nsame ruin. In the meantime, Daifusama seized on the castle of Osaka\r\nwith the young prince so suddenly that neither the garrison, nor Jiboo\r\nno sho, who lived hard by, had time to put themselves in a posture of\r\ndefense. This was a thunderbolt to the latter, who fled to Fusimi, to\r\nthe governors, where he was joined by Don Austin. Daifusama pursued\r\nthem, and a temporary peace was struck up, on condition that Jiboo no\r\nsho gave up his commission and retired to his residence in the province\r\nof Omi. He took a son of Daifusama’s with him as hostage.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, Iyeyas was supreme, the governors continuing to retain\r\ntheir empty titles. The Roman Catholics applied to Iyeyas, who received\r\nthem so kindly that they were generally of a persuasion that he\r\nintended to restore the churches and permit the fathers to preach the\r\nGospel, “so very easy are we to believe what we have a mind should\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\nHowever, at this moment they were annoyed by the lord of Firado showing\r\nsymptoms of intolerance, for in one night six hundred Christians left\r\nthe island and came to Nagasaki, contrary to the laws and edicts of\r\nTaikosama. The province of Higo, in the island of Kiusiu, was now under\r\nthe rule of Don Austin, and by his orders the inhabitants were being\r\nconverted or coerced into Christianity.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Emperor was a mere shadow. The power had fallen\r\nnominally into the hands of a boy. The scepter, or seat of power, was\r\nat the disposal of the most powerful. The respect for, or fears of,\r\nthe lately deceased ruler had not died out; and the carrying out of\r\nhis wishes, and the establishment of this boy in his place, was the\r\nalleged intention of each of the contending parties. The one party was\r\nmade up of those chiefs or lords who had been about Taikosama during\r\nhis life, and had been appointed to high offices under him, such as the\r\nfive governors or regents for his son. To these were added those who\r\nhad been engaged as commanders in the Corean wars, of whom Satsuma and\r\nKonishi were the ablest and most powerful, the latter being looked upon\r\nas the greatest soldier of his day.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Iyeyas had evidently determined that the boy, now\r\nhis grandson by marriage, should not stand in the way of his own\r\nadvancement to power and position, and that he should be made the\r\nladder by which he might reach his object.\r\n\r\nThe empire again resounded with the preparations for war. “Daifusama\r\nwas grown so absolute since the late troubles at Osaka and Menco that\r\nhe acted and did all by himself, none daring so much as dispute his\r\ncommands. This sore perplexed the governors and mortified them to the\r\nquick; however, as soon as Jiboo no sho was retired [to his castle of\r\nSawoyama, by orders of Iyeyas], they all returned back to Osaka and\r\nFusimi, Cangerafu only excepted, who pretended a grant from Taikosama\r\nto live three years in his own states.” This was probably Ooyay soongi\r\nkange katzu of Etsingo, one of the wealthiest and most powerful of\r\nthe lords, and to him Iyeyas sent orders to repair immediately to the\r\nyoung prince on pain of being prosecuted as an enemy to the state. The\r\nconfederates were trying to divide the forces of their opponent, and to\r\ngain by stratagem what he was beginning to feel himself able to obtain\r\nby the open assertion and display of power. He had possession of the\r\ncastle of Osaka and of the town of Fusimi. In the latter he left his\r\nson with a garrison. The confederate lords hoped to seize those places\r\nso soon as Iyeyas left them. Letters were dispatched to Jiboo no sho\r\nand to Konishi, who immediately joined the league, “having no other\r\nintention but to keep their promise with Taikosama, and to preserve\r\nthe crown for the young prince.” They tried to draw over the head\r\nofficers of “Daifusama’s army; and all things being in readiness, they\r\nwheeled round upon Osaka, and so secured most of the nobility to their\r\nparty. The governors, flushed with their success, sent a manifesto to\r\nDaifusama, with heavy complaints of his conduct. They commanded him to\r\nreturn to Quanto, and positively forbade him the court.”\r\n\r\nThe governors at the same time ordered all persons in his army to\r\nreturn to their posts or homes on the penalty of punishment falling\r\non their relatives and property. This order brought about the death\r\nof a Christian lady, Grace, wife of Itowo Tango no kami, one of the\r\ncommanders in the army of Iyeyas, of whom the Jesuits speak as a\r\nmiracle of beauty and piety. Her husband having joined the army of\r\nIyeyas, left command with his servants that, in case of any such order\r\nbeing issued and put in force, they were to cut off his wife’s head.\r\nHis orders were obeyed. His chief servant informed his mistress, with\r\ntears in his eyes, of his master’s orders. He, falling on his knees,\r\nbegged pardon for what he was about to do, promising to revenge her\r\nby his and his fellow-servant’s suicide. With one blow he cut off her\r\nhead, and, thinking it indecent to die in the same room as their\r\nmistress, they retired to another, where they cut open their bellies,\r\nwhile one of them set fire to the powder, and blew up the part of the\r\npalace in which they were lying.\r\n\r\nThe army of the league now numbered 100,000 men. The chiefs determined\r\nto attack the citadel of Fusimi. They contrived to set it on fire,\r\nand in a few hours was consumed “this splendid and last monument of\r\nTaikosama’s greatness, the richest and noblest palace in all Japan.”\r\nAfter this they felt themselves strong enough to take the field, and\r\nhazard a battle, if necessary, which should decide the fate of parties.\r\n“There was this difference betwixt the regent’s and the governors’\r\ntroops: The first, being under one supreme head, acted vigorously\r\nand with unanimous consent; whereas the other, depending on several\r\nmasters, and having each separate interests, the whole time was spent\r\nin marches and countermarches to no manner of purpose.”\r\n\r\nIyeyas laid siege to Gifoo, the fortress of Hide nobu or Saburo dono,\r\nthe nephew of Nobu nanga, in the province of Mino. By a stratagem and\r\nambuscade he routed the army, completely destroying it, and entered\r\nand seized the castle, taking prisoner Hide nobu. He then turned back\r\nwestward to meet the army of the governors, which was lying on the west\r\nof the plain and village of Sekingaharra. The army of his opponents had\r\nbeen re-enforced by the troops of Satsuma and of Konishi. This plain\r\nis to the east side of the hills which form the east wall of the Lake\r\nof Owomi. One hill of this ridge, Ee buki yama, is still noted for the\r\nforeign plants which grow upon its sides, the result or remains of the\r\nlabors of the Portuguese missionaries who had a residence upon the\r\nhill. From this hill flows to the east the waters of the Kisso gawa.\r\nOne of the main roads of Japan, the Naka sen do, passes through this\r\nplain from east to west, and at the village of Sekingaharra another\r\nroad crosses the former from the northwest. Here on this plain the two\r\narmies met; but before the most decisive battle in Japanese history was\r\nfought they lay thirty days facing one another, “and durst not strike a\r\nstroke.”\r\n\r\nThe army of the league numbered 80,000 men, while that of Iyeyas could\r\nonly muster 50,000. Each party had been engaged in trying to gain over\r\nsome of their opponents before trusting to the fate of war. Iyeyas had\r\nbeen delayed by his enemies in the eastern provinces; but hearing of\r\nthe position of affairs at Sekingaharra, he marched rapidly up, and in\r\nOctober, 1600, joined his army with a considerable re-enforcement of\r\ntroops. His motions were so rapid and so secret that his opponents were\r\nnot aware of his being in the province. The following day he commenced\r\nan attack upon the army of the governors, commanded by Jiboo no sho\r\nand Don Austin. “No sooner had the armies begun to move than several\r\nof the general officers, with the troops under their command, marched\r\nstraight over to the side of Iyeyas, which put the rest of the army in\r\nsuch consternation that, instead of fighting, they turned tail and fled\r\nwithout looking behind them. Daifusama, perceiving them in disorder,\r\ngave word for his men to advance; and making his way through the lines,\r\nwhich made very little opposition, gained a complete victory almost\r\nwithout the trouble of striking a blow for it. None besides the general\r\nofficers and some of the leading men had the courage to face the enemy\r\nat the first onset. These partly dispatched themselves, partly were\r\nkilled by the enemy, and partly were taken prisoners. Among these\r\nlatter was the celebrated Don Austin. This great hero, seeing his men\r\nin a rout, and no possibility of rallying again, threw himself into the\r\nmidst of the enemy’s troops, slaying on every side, and bearing all\r\ndown before him, till, wounded from head to foot, and overpowered by\r\nnumbers, he was forced to yield to fate and surrender himself prisoner,\r\ntogether with Jiboo no sho, who had not the heart (as he confessed\r\nhimself afterward) to open his belly after the example of the worthies\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\n“As for Don Austin, nothing but conscience could possibly have hindered\r\nhim from such an attempt; and therefore choosing, as he did, to pass\r\nfor heartless and a coward, and to expose himself to an ignominious\r\ndeath rather than offend God, was an action of the first rate, worthy\r\nto be found upon the roll in the history of his other heroical\r\nexploits.” The native account would make out that Don Austin attempted\r\nto escape from the field of battle, taking the road leading to the\r\nresidence of the Roman Catholic priests on the hill of Ee buki yama,\r\nbut was taken prisoner before reaching a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of this very decisive victory was to blow to the\r\nwinds the rope of sand which his enemies had been endeavoring to coil\r\nround Iyeyas. His opponents were scattered and their hands paralyzed.\r\nIyeyas was master of the situation. He lost no time in marching\r\nwestward to gain possession of Osaka. He seized Sawoyama, a castle then\r\nbelonging to Jiboo no sho, and now known as Hikonay, the residence of\r\nEe kamong no kami. The brother of the proprietor was in command of the\r\nplace. He put to death all the women and children, and set fire to the\r\nhouse, to take from the enemy the honor of leading him in triumph.\r\nMowori was in command at Osaka, and, as ruler over ten provinces,\r\nhe was now the only chief who was likely to dispute with Iyeyas the\r\nposition of regent. But he was panic-struck, and, though at the head\r\nof 40,000 men, gave up the place and surrendered to the conqueror, who\r\nimmediately entered the town in a kind of triumph, and soon after all\r\nJapan submitted to his government. He was, in truth, now the monarch of\r\nJapan. The Emperor was in existence, but this was only known near Miako\r\nby the titles which he occasionally conferred on those about his court.\r\n\r\nHideyori, the boy representative of Taikosama, was only seven years of\r\nage, and had no very strong claim to be considered that potentate’s\r\nsuccessor, a position which he could not hold without the assistance\r\nof Iyeyas, his wife’s grandfather. Iyeyas had felt that the peace of\r\nthe state was depending upon him, and that, from the position which the\r\ngovernors had taken up, either he or they must yield; but neither would\r\ngive way without an appeal to arms. The Jesuits seem all along to have\r\nshown a want of foresight in omitting to see that he was the coming\r\nman, and made a mistake in placing their trust in Don Austin, whose\r\nposition was now to them a source of great anxiety.\r\n\r\nInto the late war there does not seem to have entered any religious\r\nelement of discord, as Christians of rank were found upon both sides.\r\nThe lords of Arima and Omura and Kahi no kami (who is frequently\r\nmentioned by the Jesuit writers) were in the army of Iyeyas, while Don\r\nAustin and others took the opposite side.\r\n\r\nIshida, Jiboo no sho, being now a prisoner, was not likely to receive\r\nmuch mercy at the hands of Iyeyas. Letters had passed between them\r\nwhich reduced their position to a personal quarrel. He had already\r\nbeen once spared by his foe, and had retired on parole to his castle\r\nof Sawoyama. Thinking that an opportunity for revenge had arrived,\r\nhe put himself at the head of the army of the confederates. He had\r\nagain failed, and now found himself a prisoner in an ignominious and\r\ndishonorable position. But Konishi Setsu, or Tsu no kami, also a\r\nprisoner, ran the risk of losing his life, more probably from jealousy\r\nof his military capacity than from any other reason. He was the son of\r\na drug merchant in Sakkai. The eulogiums pronounced upon him by the\r\nChristian writers may pass for what each values them at; but he had\r\nbeen trusted in a very responsible position by Taikosama in Corea. He\r\nhad subsequently been degraded at the instigation of his rivals, and\r\nafterward reinstated for the accomplishment of schemes requiring the\r\nutmost acuteness in diplomacy, as well as for the execution of plans\r\nrequiring military skill and prowess. He had shown himself capable of\r\nboth. As an evidence of the position to which he had raised himself\r\nwas the marriage of his son to the granddaughter of Iyeyas himself. He\r\nhad been appointed to the office then known as viceroy of the island\r\nof Kiusiu, and was at the same time commander-in-chief both of the\r\nnaval and military forces in the Corean war. Had Iyeyas acted with\r\nhis ordinary clemency and judgment, he would after his victory have\r\npardoned such a rival and family connection; but there were hungry\r\nwolves who personally hated Don Austin, who gloated over his downfall,\r\nand cast longing eyes on his territories, about to be confiscated.\r\nChief of these was Toronosuqui, “Vir ter execrandus,” as the Jesuits\r\nstyle him, one of the coarsest men of Japanese history, but since his\r\ndeath canonized as a saint in the Japanese calendar as Say sho go sama\r\nof the Nitchi ren sect of Buddhists. Hitherto known by this name of\r\nToronosuqui, he figures in the subsequent letters of the Jesuits as\r\nCanzuge dono, or properly, as the title now is, Kazuyay no kami.\r\n\r\nAfter his capture, Konishi seems to have been treated with great\r\nrigor--not being allowed to see any of his relatives or any foreign\r\npriest--and was beheaded, along with the Jiboo no sho, at Awata\r\nngootchi, the common execution-ground at Miako. His young son was\r\nshortly afterward inveigled and murdered by Mowori, who thought to\r\nplease Iyeyas and save himself, after his mean surrender of himself\r\nand his position, by sending the head of Don Austin’s child to his\r\nwife’s grandfather; but Iyeyas was disgusted, and Mowori in the end was\r\nstripped of the greater part of his possessions.\r\n\r\nNative writers agree with the Jesuit accounts in giving Iyeyas credit\r\nfor great moderation and sagacity in the use of the power which had\r\nfallen into his hands. Thinking himself firmly seated, he tried to\r\nmake all know that he wished the past to be forgotten--that he was\r\nnot angry with those who had been in arms against him, but that he\r\nwas grieved that it had been necessary that so much blood should have\r\nbeen shed. He granted an amnesty to all who would accept of it; and\r\neven some--such as Tatchibanna--who were not very influential, and who\r\nwould neither accept of it nor submit to him, he left quietly alone\r\nto allow time to work. The great secret of his power seems to have\r\nbeen that when he once made a promise he never broke it, and the most\r\nperfect reliance was placed upon his word. “In effect, Daifusama,\r\nbeing naturally of a meek and easy temper, took quite different\r\nmethods from Taikosama, who had rendered himself extremely odious by\r\nhis cruel and severe oppressions. He proposed to himself to govern\r\nmore by love than fear; and therefore, contrary to the maxims of his\r\npredecessor, pardoned several of the lords that bore arms against him.\r\nMoreover, he sent a pardon to Don Austin’s lady and daughter (who\r\nexpected, according to law, to have shared his fate), as also to his\r\nbrethren and their children; and, what is more, he did not show any\r\nresentment to the fathers for being constant to the interests of Don\r\nAustin, or for harboring his lady at the time of her retreat at Nanga\r\nsaki.” The only unsettled portion of the empire was the island of\r\nKiusiu. The territory of Don Austin in the province of Higo was handed\r\nover to Katto Kiomassa, or Toronosuqui, who, as has been said, was a\r\nvirulent opponent of the Christian religion. While Don Austin held this\r\nterritory, by the advice of his spiritual superiors, every one had been\r\ncompelled to be baptized and turn Christian, or to leave the territory.\r\nIt was now the turn of the opposite party to use the same tactics, and\r\nmost mercilessly they followed the example set by these Spanish priests\r\nboth in Japan and in Europe.\r\n\r\nSatsuma, who had escaped from the field of Sekingaharra, expected that\r\nthe weight of the victor’s wrath would shortly fall upon him, and he\r\nprepared for it. The subjection of Kiusiu was intrusted to Kuroda\r\nKahi no kami and Terasawa Sima no kami, with the lesser lords who had\r\nterritories in the island. Satsuma was obliged to yield, and submitted\r\nto Iyeyas, receiving back from him the greater part of the territory\r\nthen held by him.\r\n\r\nThe part of the island of Nippon east of the barrier of Hakonay, in\r\nthe province of Segami, is commonly called Kwanto; and the Hasshiu, or\r\neight provinces beyond the boundary toward the east part of the island,\r\nhad more or less for many years been under the entire rule of Iyeyas.\r\nKamakura, which had at one period been a rival to Miako as a second\r\ncapital, had fallen into decay. Odawara, the castle of the Hojio\r\nfamily, at the head of the same bay, had never risen to any position\r\nas a central city. The Nishi maro, a part of the castle of Yedo, had\r\nformerly been built and occupied by Owota do kwang, whose memory is to\r\nthis day cherished in Japan, and his name and writings are still extant\r\non some parts of his castle or shiro. On a summer house in the garden\r\nof the castle is a couplet in poetry which is looked upon as a prophecy\r\nof coming events with reference to its accomplishment in the present\r\nage:\r\n\r\n  “From this window I look upon Fusiyama,\r\n  With its snow of a thousand years.\r\n  To my gate ships will come from the far East\r\n  Ten thousand miles.”\r\n\r\nConsidering the associations which hung around Miako and Narra and\r\nOsaka as the capitals, imperial, ecclesiastical and commercial, of the\r\nempire, it might be deemed a great stretch of power and firm confidence\r\nin himself and the stability of his system of government, that Iyeyas\r\nshould think of removing the location of the executive to Yedo. He had\r\ndoubtless pondered long and deeply over the best system of government\r\nfor the country. He had seen the anarchy which preceded the rise of\r\nNobu nanga to power; he had seen the want of system by which the\r\nstructure of government at that time had crumbled down with the fall\r\nof the one man upon whoso shoulders it had been supported; he had all\r\nthe experience since that time to be gained from ruling an extensive\r\nterritory of his own, combined with what observations he might\r\nmake upon the system of Taikosama. In the settling of that system,\r\ndoubtless, he had a large share; but he went further than Taikosama,\r\nand, disregarding the old associations connected with Miako, he removed\r\nthe seat of the executive to his own provinces and to his own court in\r\nthe city of Yedo, in what was considered a remote part of the empire,\r\nthe inhabitants of which were looked upon as rude and unpolished, and\r\nregarded with contempt as savages of the east--“Azuma yebis.” The city,\r\nwhen Iyeyas first took possession of the shiro, consisted only of one\r\nstreet, known then and now as Koji matchi. It had increased very much\r\nin size under his care, and through the residence of the court, the\r\nDaimios, and their wives and families, and in no long time became a\r\ncity of commercial importance. Although Yoritomo, and the Shiogoons and\r\nKwanreis who succeeded him, held court at Kamakura and in the Kwanto,\r\nno one had ever called upon the great feudal lords, or Daimios, as\r\nwe may now call them, to reside or keep up establishments there; but\r\nIyeyas seemed to think that in an empire like Japan, without external\r\nfoes, strength would be gained by a division of the empire. All his\r\nplans seem to have had regard to the welfare and peace of the country\r\nrather than the gratification of ambition, which he never allowed to\r\nmaster his judgment.\r\n\r\nThis year (1600) and the following Iyeyas devoted to internal\r\nimprovements, especially in the highways of the empire. The road\r\nbetween the two capitals, Yedo and Miako, was greatly improved.\r\nHe arranged the stations (tsoongi, or shooku), to the number of\r\nfifty-three, at nearly equal distances along the road, for the\r\naccommodation of Daimios and others traveling on official business. The\r\nDo chioo, or laws of the roads, were laid down, regulating the traffic,\r\nbut more especially the movements and service of these lords when\r\ntraveling.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1603 to Iyeyas was given the hereditary title and\r\npower of Se i dai shiogoon, or tranquilizer of barbarians and\r\ncommander-in-chief. The last who had held this office was Yoshikanga\r\nYoshiteru, who died in 1597. Hideyori was made Naidaijori.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHISTORY TO THE EXPULSION OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis termination of the sixteenth century was in Japan one of the most\r\nnotable time-marks in the history of the empire. It was an era at which\r\na long series of intestine broils and of civil war came to an end, and\r\ngave way to an unexampled period of peace and happiness. Indirectly,\r\nJapan was affected by changes of greater ultimate results which had\r\ncommenced long before at the opposite side of the world.\r\n\r\nPortugal, in the zenith of its maritime glory and power, had hitherto\r\nretained in her own hands the navigation and the trade of the East.\r\nBold as these early navigators were, the accounts given of their\r\nproceedings show them to have conjoined, in strange recklessness,\r\nreligion with war, trade with piracy--“the sweet yoke” of their own\r\nideas of government with ferocious cruelty to every one opposed to\r\nthem. Perhaps this was to some extent necessary, when the health and\r\nprowess of a few men, not easily replaced in case of loss, were opposed\r\nto the climate and weight of numbers whose losses could easily be\r\nrecruited by others equally useless and contemptible as foes. Grotius\r\nsays of Englishmen of that time, that they obey like slaves and govern\r\nlike tyrants. Toward the latter part of the century, the bigotry of\r\nPhilip II. was raising powers against him in Europe, before which\r\nthe then colossal but unwieldy empire under his rule was destined to\r\ncrumble to pieces. The same intolerant policy which his emissaries\r\nin Japan were pursuing was being carried out by the old man, in the\r\nconscientious belief that he was furthering and hastening the kingdom\r\nof heaven, by fierce persecution and diabolical atrocities. The dreams\r\nwhich led men to undertake long voyages to America in the pursuit of\r\na Utopia, infused a new spirit of boldness and adventure into the\r\nnavigators of maritime countries. At the same time, the Reformation\r\nand the changes in the religious ideas among the people of Europe, and\r\nespecially in Holland, England, and for a time in France, tended to\r\nthrow contempt on the concessions and grants and privileges given by\r\nthe Pope to Portugal, and by which their trade to the East was up to\r\nthat time hedged in.\r\n\r\nIn 1577 Sir Francis Drake broke in upon this monopoly; and the\r\nSpaniards complained of the English infringing their rights, granted by\r\nthe Pope, by sailing in the Eastern seas.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese vessels which traded with the East had hitherto carried\r\ntheir produce to Lisbon or Cadiz, and thence it was carried to the\r\ncoasts of Europe by the Dutch and English. But when war broke out\r\nbetween these countries, Philip, thinking to clip the wings of his\r\nenemies, interdicted this trade. This compelled them to take a longer\r\nflight and seek Eastern commodities at the fountain-head. The navies\r\nof the Dutch and Portuguese came into collision on the Eastern seas,\r\nand the former were victorious, and one after another of the large\r\nPortuguese carracks fell to the English and Dutch privateers.\r\n\r\nIn 1599 the East India Company of England was set on foot, and\r\ncommenced operations, after being nearly arrested by the English\r\ngovernment to please the Spaniards, by acknowledging their rights in\r\nthe Eastern seas; and in 1598 the Dutch fleet sailed, of which William\r\nAdams of Gillingham was pilot.\r\n\r\nAccording to native accounts, in the sixth year of Kay cho English\r\nvessels came to Ike no oora; but one of these was wrecked during a gale\r\nin the Sea of Segami. A message was dispatched from Yedo to order the\r\ncrew to be sent there. Among them was Adams. He remained in Yedo, but\r\nthe others returned.\r\n\r\nThe vessels belonging to the East India Company sailed from England\r\nupon the eighth voyage, under the command of Captain Saris, in 1611,\r\nwith the intention of opening a trade with Japan. There seemed at this\r\ntime every prospect of the Portuguese monopoly being broken up, and\r\nof the trade of this distant country being thrown open to the Western\r\nworld. Amid the broils and quarrels with which Japan was torn, whether\r\namong the lords, or between the Buddhists and Roman Catholics, or the\r\nnatives and Portuguese merchants, or the Portuguese and Dutch and\r\nEnglish, it is curious to see the practical and sound good sense of one\r\nman, putting him into a position of eminence and trust, when all around\r\nhim was deceit and jealousy. Rising, after five years of obscurity\r\nand hardship, on the ground of his simple strength of character and\r\npractical training, William Adams seems to have become the trusted\r\nconfidant and referee of Iyeyas on foreign questions. Residing in\r\nYedo, at the southwest corner of the Nihon bashi, or bridge of Japan,\r\nthe street where he lived retains to this day the distinguishing name\r\nof “The Pilot’s,” or Anjin. He seems to have afterward removed to the\r\nstreet Yaiyossu, in close proximity to the castle moat.--Both Anjin and\r\nYaiyossu may be corruptions of the name Adams. In Cantonese dialect,\r\nan cham is a word for a compass, and “Adams” might be written with\r\nthese characters.--Here his knowledge of geometry, navigation and\r\nmathematics, with some acquaintance with shipbuilding, brought him\r\nunder the notice of Iyeyas, by whom he seems to have been employed as\r\ninterpreter, shipbuilder, and general confidant on foreign affairs. He\r\nwas ultimately raised to the position of a small Hattamoto, or lesser\r\nbaron, with ground equal to the support of eighty or ninety families,\r\nbesides his own rental. This estate is said, in one of the letters\r\nfrom Japan, to be in Segami, and to have been named Fibi, and situated\r\nin the neighborhood of Ooraga, the port of Yedo, and must certainly\r\nbe known to the Japanese government as having belonged to the English\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, by all these changes, the position of the Portuguese and\r\nof the Roman Catholic priests was changed in Japan. The converts of\r\nNagasaki would see foreigners coming who paid no respect to the priests\r\nand bishops whom they had been taught to reverence. The powers in\r\nthe country would begin to see that the profits of the trade could\r\nbe enjoyed without winking at the coercion of their own people to a\r\nforeign religion, and which placed them at the disposal of a power\r\nexterior to the state. The English and Dutch tried to loosen the hold\r\nwhich their rivals had in the good opinion of their customers; and\r\nthe eyes of the Japanese were thus opened to the evils of admitting\r\nto their shores foreigners who were likely to prove centers of\r\ndisaffection and to instill ideas of freedom and lawlessness among the\r\nsubjects of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe letters of the Jesuits throw their own light upon the state of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church in Japan at the different points where churches\r\nor seminaries had been erected, and it may thence be gathered in what\r\nmanner they treated their neighbors, or those over whom they could\r\npretend to assume any power. On the other hand, from the narratives\r\ngiven by Cocks and Saris, some idea of the position of the seafaring\r\ncommunities at Firado and Nagasaki, and other ports, may be obtained.\r\nThese seaports seem to have been too often the resorts of the lowest\r\nclass of adventurers. The result was uproars, broils and murders among\r\nthe foreigners, requiring ever and anon the intervention of the native\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nIyeyas was in all probability ignorant of all these circumstances,\r\nwhich were effecting an indirect change upon those resorting to the\r\ncountry. At the Roman Catholic party he had aimed an effectual blow\r\nby putting the leading man of the party, Don Austin, out of the way\r\non grounds totally unconnected with his religion. And the foreign\r\npriests do not seem to have given him personally much concern at\r\nthis time. In the neighborhood of Miako they did not dare of late to\r\nmake any public displays. In 1604 there were of the Jesuits 120 in\r\nJapan. They flattered themselves that “as for religion, it flourished\r\neverywhere, and made vast progress through all the kingdoms under so\r\neasy and peaceable a government. Notwithstanding, two obstacles still\r\nexisted--the one Taikosama’s edict, and the other the vices of the\r\npeople. But what gave our religion most reputation was the gracious\r\nreception the Cubo himself [Iyeyas] was pleased to give the fathers of\r\nthe Society.” The Jesuits had recently extended their mission to the\r\nextreme north of Japan, and even into the islands of Yezo and Sado.\r\n\r\nDuring this and the previous year the Jesuits were unfortunate,\r\ninasmuch as the vessels bringing the yearly supplies, as well as the\r\nlarge annual carrack from Macao to Japan, were taken by the Dutch\r\nprivateers; but Iyeyas, hearing of their loss, presented a donation to\r\nthe Society, by which means they “made a tolerable shift for the rest\r\nof this year.”\r\n\r\nTerasawa, Sima no kami, who had been governor of Nagasaki, irritated\r\nby the influence brought to bear against him by the Roman Catholic\r\nparty at Miako, turned the weapons they had taught him to use against\r\nthemselves, and tried to force his subjects to renounce the new\r\ndoctrines. Part of the estates of Don Austin had fallen to his share.\r\nAnother part had fallen under the rule of Toronosuqui, who in the year\r\n1602 “ravaged the vineyard of the Lord like a wild boar that thirsts\r\nafter nothing but blood. He began like a fox and ended like a lion.”\r\nThus it was in the part of the empire in which most intolerance had\r\nbeen shown by Don Austin (under the instruction of foreign priests) to\r\nhis countrymen, and where they were obliged either to adopt the Roman\r\nCatholic doctrines or leave the country, that the plan was retaliated\r\nupon themselves.\r\n\r\nNative accounts tell: “In 1608 a Dutch ship came to Hirado and asked\r\nthat Adams might be sent down from Yedo. He was sent. Iyeyas wrote\r\nunder the red seal that the English and Dutch might trade in any part\r\nof Japan. Hide tada also allowed them to trade; but the padre sect\r\nwere not allowed to come to Japan. But the English traders said that\r\nthere was no profit to be made out of the trade as it was obliged to be\r\nconducted, and said they could not come back; therefore the Dutch only\r\nremained.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time Iyeyas directed his attention to the internal economy\r\nof the empire--improving the public roads, placing inns upon them, and\r\nstrengthening his castles at Yedo, Suraga, Miako, Osaka, and Kofu. He\r\nwas aided in this by the discovery of valuable gold-deposits in the\r\nisland of Sado, and the coin the koban was for the first time put into\r\ncirculation. During the year 1609 Shimadzu yoshi hissa, a relative of\r\nthe Prince of Satsuma, set out from Satsuma with a force of vessels and\r\ntroops to bring the King of the Liookioo Islands more completely under\r\nthe power of Japan, and succeeded in his object, receiving the islands\r\nhe had conquered as a gift from the hands of Iyeyas.\r\n\r\nThe designs of Iyeyas against Hideyori began to develop themselves.\r\nUpon the occasion of the investiture of his son with the title of\r\nShiogoon, he expressed the thought that Hideyori ought to pay him a\r\nvisit to compliment him; but his mother refused to allow Hideyori to do\r\nso, protesting she would rather cut his belly open with her own hand\r\nthan allow him to go, thus showing the extreme suspicion she had of the\r\nintentions of Iyeyas.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Christians enjoyed a profound peace, which was\r\nattributed in the Jesuit letters rather to the fear of this party\r\njoining Hideyori than to any love for the doctrines promulgated. But\r\nat the same time there were men in power not unfavorable to them, and\r\nthey were always able to keep anything obnoxious out of view. Such\r\nwere Kowotsuki no kami, the favorite of Iyeyas (called by the letters\r\nCoxuquendono), and Itakura, governor of Miako.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1606 the Portuguese bishop, Cerqueria, visited Iyeyas at\r\nMiako, and was received by him with the honors given to one of their\r\nown bishops of royal blood. However, this favor did not seem to last\r\nlong. The mother of Hideyori, incensed at some of her ladies having\r\ndeclared themselves Christians, appealed to Iyeyas. This was an\r\nopportunity of pleasing her not to be missed, and he issued forthwith\r\nthe following proclamation:\r\n\r\n“The Cubosama hearing that several of his subjects, contrary to the\r\nlate edict, have embraced the Christian religion, is highly offended.\r\nWherefore let all officers of his court be careful to see his orders\r\nobserved. Moreover, he thinks it necessary, for the good of the state,\r\nthat none should embrace that new doctrine; and for such as have\r\nalready done so, let them change immediately upon notice hereof.--24th\r\nof the 4th moon” (1606).\r\n\r\nNo immediate action appears to have been taken upon this proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1607, Iyeyas expressed a desire to see the Father\r\nProvincial. He accordingly set out for Kofu, a castle in the province\r\nof Kahi, where Iyeyas was residing, and here he was received with much\r\nkindness. In their notice of Yedo the fathers say that Iyeyas employed\r\nduring the previous year above 300,000 hands in the works about the\r\ncastle of Yedo. The towers of the castle were nine stories high and\r\ngilt at the top, together with delicious gardens, terraces, galleries,\r\ncourts, and magnificent works. By these fathers the mountain Fusiyama\r\nis mentioned as an active volcano, “a mountain of fire, famed for its\r\nbeauty, height, and whirling flames.” Even at this time it is to be\r\nnoticed that all the “kings of Japan” had their palaces there.\r\n\r\nIn this tour a slight notice is given to Kamakura (Cumamura, as it\r\nis called by the fathers), “where the Cubos and Xogoones formerly\r\nkept their courts. It is currently reported that there were upward of\r\n200,000 houses in that town alone; but when these fathers went that way\r\nthey were reduced to near 500.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these slight appearances of returning favor to the\r\nJesuit fathers, the opposition to conversion increased as the profits\r\nfrom trade decreased. The ruling powers in the island of Kiusiu were\r\nnow more or less against the Romish priests, who inculcated a line of\r\nconduct which was incompatible with living at peace with a neighbor,\r\nif holding a different view of religion. Nagasaki was in 1607 said to\r\nbe entirely converted to the Christian religion. It was divided into\r\nfive parishes. “There were two confraternities--a house of mercy and a\r\nhospital--which diffused a sweet odor of sanctity all over Japan.” But\r\nthis odor did not extend to the Portuguese who frequented the port,\r\nand, in consequence of some act of misconduct, Iyeyas ordered Arima\r\n(Don Protase, as he is called by the Roman Catholic writers) to burn\r\na large Portuguese vessel then lying in the harbor. The consequence\r\nwas that the captain left the place. He was pursued by an overwhelming\r\nforce, and, overtaken during a calm, was forced to blow up his ship.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1611, Iyeyas seems to have made up his mind that, to\r\nsettle the country upon a sure basis, some definite understanding\r\nmust be come to with Hideyori and his mother. Of what his designs\r\nreally were there are probably no proofs, as he was not generally\r\ncommunicative before action. He marched from Soonpu to Miako at the\r\nhead of upward of 70,000 men. The general suspicions of his countrymen\r\npointed to Hideyori as the cause of a movement on so large a scale.\r\nArrived at Miako, he insisted upon an interview with the young man,\r\nthen twenty-three years of age. After much delay and show of suspicion,\r\nthis was agreed to, and he arrived at the capital with a splendid\r\nretinue. Here he was received with the utmost deference and kindness by\r\nIyeyas, who shed tears over the remembrance of his father’s kindness.\r\nThe visit was returned in a few days, presents were interchanged, and\r\nthe prince returned to his mother at Osaka overjoyed with his reception.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit writers notice that during the same year died Canzugedono,\r\nKing of Fingo (Toronosuqui), the persecutor of the Christians; “and, as\r\nHeaven would have it, he was seized with an apoplexy on the very day he\r\nwas intending to renew the persecution against the faithful.” Native\r\naccounts attribute his death to poison administered by order of Iyeyas\r\nat Fusimi. He had thrown out some seditious and rebellions threats\r\nagainst Iyeyas. Among other things stated against him, he refused,\r\nwhen ordered, to shave off his whiskers at court. He was, as has been\r\nstated above, canonized in the Japanese calendar by the title of Say\r\nsho go sama--probably on account of his opposition to foreigners, and\r\nthe zeal with which he tried to root out Christianity. To this day\r\nthe mark of his hand upon paper is used as a charm placed over the\r\ndoor to drive away evil spirits. Since the admission of foreigners in\r\n1858, his character as a saint worthy of worship has risen in national\r\nestimation, and his temples have been rebuilt. One in Yokohama is more\r\nlargely patronized than any other temple in the place. Processions\r\nin his honor are among the most prominent indications of religious\r\nfeeling, and the sect to which he belonged, the Nitchi ren shioo, has\r\nprofited largely by excitement and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, at Nagasaki, notwithstanding the proclamations which\r\nhad been issued by government against such exhibitions, upon the\r\nbeatification of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the Society of Jesuits made a\r\nsolemn procession through the streets, when forty priests assisted in\r\ncopes, besides religious of St. Francis, St. Dominic, and St. Austin,\r\nwho then resided in the town. The next day the bishop officiated _in\r\npontificalibus_, and the ceremony concluded with illuminations of joy.\r\nThe same order was observed at Arima.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year the Shiogoon Hide tada, the son of Iyeyas,\r\nmarried the sister of Kita Mandocoro, wife of Taikosama, mother of\r\nHideyori, and niece of Nobu nanga.\r\n\r\nHideyori had still many adherents, who were attached to him and to\r\nhis father’s memory. Iyeyas had been afraid of acting against the\r\nChristians so severely as to compel them to throw their weight into\r\nthe opposite scale; but he began to see that he could keep all the\r\nadvantages of trade through the Dutch, and get rid of the political\r\ndangers which threatened Japan through the foreign priesthood. The\r\nJesuits allege that the Dutch encouraged him in these views, explaining\r\nhow the Society had been driven out of their countries by the princes\r\nof Germany and Holland as disturbers of the public peace.\r\n\r\nIn 1612 he determined to get rid of these ever-disquieting agents,\r\nthe more excited thereto by finding himself in the meshes of a net\r\nout of which he could only break his way by force. He found that the\r\nPrince of Arima, one of the warmest and most devoted to the cause of\r\nChristianity (whose son had married the granddaughter of Iyeyas), had\r\nbeen intriguing with the officers at court, to win their good offices\r\nby bribery, in gaining for him large additions to his territory. He\r\nnow, for the first time, acted with severity against some of the\r\nnative Christians about the court. Fourteen were condemned to death,\r\nbut the sentence was commuted to perpetual banishment and confiscation\r\nof their estates. This action on the part of Iyeyas himself at once\r\nbrought out into bolder relief the two parties. Those officers who had\r\nhitherto winked at the Christians, and had permitted them to carry on\r\ntheir worship and preaching undisturbed, now saw which way the wind\r\nwas blowing, and acted accordingly. This severity was carried into the\r\nheart of the court--one of the concubines of Iyeyas being confined and\r\nbanished to the island of Oshima, and thence to the smaller island of\r\nNishima, and thence to a rock, Cozu shima, upon which seven or eight\r\nfishermen lived in straw huts, subsisting on what they caught; and\r\nthese men were ordered to keep this lady.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Don Protase of Arima suffered. His son Michael,\r\nwho had been brought up as a Christian, fearing to lose possession of\r\nhis father’s dominions, informed against him, accusing him of crimes,\r\nand suborning witnesses against him. Upon the proof offered he was\r\nbeheaded. This Christian’s son Michael, who had divorced a Christian\r\nlady to marry the granddaughter of Iyeyas, then turned apostate,\r\nand began a persecution within his territories of all who professed\r\nChristianity. He began, in order to please Iyeyas, by putting to death\r\ntwo boys, his own nephews. Here again, where the Jesuits had been\r\nmost intolerant, the tables were turned upon them. In the province of\r\nBoongo, at one time the stronghold of the Roman Catholics, the same\r\naction was being taken; and about this time, in Yedo, the Shiogoon,\r\non the representation of informers, put to death some natives who had\r\nbuilt a new church, and banished the father out of the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, Don Michael of Arima was pressed by his wife and others to\r\nrenew his severities, and eight Christians were burned near his castle\r\nby slow fires.\r\n\r\nIn 1614, Iyeyas was stimulated by the opponents of Christianity to take\r\naction against those who professed it. With the advice of his council\r\nhe issued orders that all religious, European and Japanese, should be\r\nsent out of the country, that the churches should be pulled down, and\r\nthe Christian members be forced to renounce their faith. To carry out\r\nthese orders, all foreign priests and natives, members of the Jesuit\r\nSociety, were ordered to leave Miako, Osaka and Fusimi, and retire to\r\nNagasaki. Hojo Segami no kami was ordered to see that this order was\r\nexecuted; but he was chosen, perhaps, from a desire to remove him out\r\nof the way, as well as to take the opportunity of seizing his estate.\r\nAccordingly, while he was so engaged, he was accused of some crime,\r\nand his estates confiscated. The native Christians were banished to\r\nTsoongaru, at the northern extremity of the island. At Kanesawa, in\r\nKanga, Justo Ookon dono Takayama was ordered to leave with the others.\r\nStill further to make sure of the success of his projects, Iyeyas\r\ndispatched to the island of Kiusiu upward of 10,000 men, under three\r\nleaders, for the purpose of overawing the Christians and putting down\r\nany attempts to rise in that quarter. In Kiusiu the new doctrines had\r\nfirst taken root, and had flourished with greater luxuriance than on\r\nthe main island of Nippon. The lordships were smaller, and therefore\r\nthe advantages of trade were proportionably greater in the eyes of\r\nthe proprietors. But as in the outset these lesser lords had favored\r\nwhat seemed to them a source of revenue, when things turned against\r\nthe religion they distinguished themselves by zeal in putting down\r\nwhat in the end threatened to deprive them of everything. In them the\r\ngovernment found the most active and zealous assistants. Many of these\r\nlords or their parents had been baptized. The Jesuits had there most\r\nsway, and had used it with the most intolerance; and Iyeyas determined,\r\nbefore striking a blow at Hideyori in Osaka, to remove any chance of\r\na diversion being made in his favor on the part of the Christians in\r\nthis distant part of the empire. But if we believe the letters of the\r\nfathers, the fortitude and courage with which martyrdom was endured\r\nby professing natives must be looked on with admiration. The better\r\nclasses lost everything--lands, position, comforts, in many cases their\r\nwives and children, and, last of all, their lives--in the cause of\r\ntheir faith. The poorer gave up their lives, all they had to give, with\r\nzeal, fortitude, and even joy.\r\n\r\nIn the other parts of Kiusiu, in Tsikuzen and Figo, and in the remote\r\nislands of Xequi or Kossiki, the same spirit was shown toward the\r\nChristians; and upon October 25, 1614, three hundred persons--in a\r\nword, all the Jesuits, except eighteen fathers and nine brothers, with\r\na few cathechists (who lay hid in the country for the help of the\r\nfaithful)--were shipped off out of the country by a Portuguese vessel.\r\nThis mode of dealing with persons in the position assumed by these\r\nforeigners and their adherents seems to have been at once lenient, yet\r\ndetermined, and mercenary without being severe. The party had assumed\r\na political aspect threatening to the state. The very ladies of his\r\nhousehold had been supported by these foreigners in opposition to\r\nthe Kubosama himself. And as it was intended to be a final political\r\nstep, and not a religious persecution, any foreigner found thereafter\r\nspreading such intolerant doctrines would be treated as a political\r\npartisan. Justo was put on board a Chinese vessel with some Spanish\r\npriests and some Japonian clerks, and set sail for Manila, where he\r\ndied shortly after his arrival.\r\n\r\nThe step of removing from the capital and its neighborhood all the\r\nforeign fathers was, in its results, of the utmost importance to the\r\ncause of religion. During the rule of Nobu nanga and Taikosama, Father\r\nRodriguez, the interpreter, a man evidently well acquainted with the\r\nlanguage and with the court, was invited or allowed to remain in the\r\ncapital. From the accounts sent thence it is evident that by tact and\r\njudgment Father Rodriguez had maintained his place, that he was in\r\ncommunication with the highest officers at court, and exercised an\r\nunseen but potent power in behalf of his brethren. With such a person\r\nat court, opposition cannot so easily gain head. Evil reports are\r\nwarded off, occasional words in favor can be thrown in; but with the\r\nwithdrawal of such a power from the court the foreign cause becomes\r\npowerless. Every one is ready to abuse, and to chime in to please his\r\nsuperior. There is no possibility of warding off the blows aimed. It\r\nis impossible to know whether the highest power knows anything of the\r\nedicts put out in his name. The Buddhists, a powerful body, would\r\nbe ready to press down upon and thrust out opponents who had borne\r\nthemselves so proudly in the day of their prosperity. Their own tactics\r\nrecoiled upon the fathers; and when they were turned out of court,\r\nwithout friends or advocates, their cause became hopeless, and with\r\ntheir downfall the position of all other foreigners in the country was\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, not a good defense of the policy adopted in Japan,\r\nto remember that it was nearly identical with that which England was\r\ncompelled to adopt at the same time, and under similar circumstances.\r\nIn both countries the change was conducted by the government, and\r\nin both the spirit of the people rose against the interference of a\r\nforeign priesthood with the national concerns. The truth is, that\r\nthe doctrine of the Papal supremacy is an “exterritoriality clause”\r\nof itself, which, operating in a country professing another faith,\r\ncreates an _imperium in imperio_, which becomes very embarrassing to\r\na government, whether it be Japan or England. The confiscation of\r\nabbey-lands in England may be compared with, or was analogous to, the\r\nconfiscation of the lands of the lords of Japan, while informers in\r\neach were rewarded by a gift of the property belonging to offenders of\r\nless note. The difficulty with which Japan had to cope was, that there\r\nwas no mode of escape from persecution by going into exile into other\r\ncountries until the storm had blown over.\r\n\r\nIn 1615, after getting rid of these politically dangerous persons,\r\nIyeyas seemed to think that he might push things to extremities with\r\nHideyori and his mother. He ordered up all the troops in Kiusiu to\r\nOsaka, and thither he repaired with a large force. He had endeavored\r\nfor some time to make Hideyori spend his revenues so freely as to\r\nimpoverish his exchequer. He had induced him to rebuild the large\r\ntemple of Buddha in Miako, and the day was fixed for the consecration;\r\nbut the suspicions of the mother were roused, and the solemnity was\r\npostponed. The young man had presented a large bell to the temple,\r\nupon which, it is said, that a wish was engraved that Yedo might be\r\ndestroyed. This bell is never struck. This was made a pretext for a\r\nquarrel, and as the deserters from the castle reported that it was\r\nunprovided, it was forthwith invested, and war entered upon. There\r\nwere many able commanders in the party of Hideyori, and the castle of\r\nOsaka was defended so well that after some time Iyeyas was obliged to\r\nretire and raise the siege, as he was losing prestige by delay, and men\r\nby desertion. An armistice was agreed upon at the desire of Iyeyas;\r\nbut it seems to have been demanded only to give time. The surrounding\r\ncountry was desolated, and before long hostilities were renewed; and as\r\na part of the army of Hideyori was encamped outside, a general battle\r\nensued on June 3, 1615. In the account of the Jesuits, two of whom were\r\npresent, the army of Iyeyas was on the point of defeat, when, probably\r\nthrough treachery, the castle was set on fire, the troops of Hideyori\r\nbecame panic-struck, and a total rout and general slaughter ensued. In\r\nthe relation by Trigautius it is stated that in no battle in Japanese\r\nhistory did so much slaughter take place as in this. The populous\r\nneighborhood, the density of the city, the lawlessness of the troops,\r\nall combined to produce a fearful carnage. No certain information was\r\never got of the death of Hideyori or his mother. In all probability\r\nthey committed suicide, and their bodies were destroyed in the\r\nconflagration. Reports were circulated of their having fled--some said\r\nto Koya, others to Satsuma; but as diligent search was made for six\r\nmonths after, and no trace of them was discovered with certainty either\r\nthen or in after years, the common report is likely to be correct. His\r\nnatural son was taken and beheaded. After this decisive battle, Iyeyas,\r\nhaving satisfied himself that he had made all things sure about Miako\r\nand Osaka, returned to Soonpu, and his son to Yedo. However, Iyeyas\r\ndid not live long to gather the fruits of his sowing, or witness the\r\nsuccess of his schemes in the working of his laws. He died on March\r\n8, 1616, at Soonpu, advising his sons to be kind to the nobles, and,\r\nabove all, to govern their subjects in the spirit of tenderness and\r\naffection. He died not without suspicion of his having been poisoned by\r\nhis second son, Hideyas, the elder brother of Hidetada, the Shiogoon.\r\nHe was buried in the hills of Nikko, a short distance north of Yedo,\r\nwith great splendor. His posthumous title or name and rank is To sho,\r\nDai Gongen mia (Tung chau, Ta K’iuen hien kung) d’zo jo itchi-i, Dai jo\r\ndai jin--The Eastern Light, the Illustrious Gem (a Buddhist title for a\r\ndeified being) of the first rank, Prime Minister. He is often spoken of\r\nas To sho goo and Gongen sama, but this latter is a generic term, and\r\nnot specially applicable to any individual.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company endeavored, shortly before the death of Iyeyas,\r\nto open a trade with Japan, and the letters of Captain Saris, Cocks,\r\nand others, give an interesting account of the country at the time. In\r\nanswer to a letter from the King of Great Britain, Iyeyas granted to\r\nhis majesty’s subjects certain privileges of trade, and the settling\r\nof a factory in Japan, and confirmed these under his broad seal for\r\nthe better determining thereof. This document, a fac-simile of the\r\noriginal, is to be seen in Purchas. For sufficient reasons, the factory\r\nwas in no long time withdrawn, and the trade entirely ceased in 1621.\r\n\r\nIn 1619 some notice of the persecutions carried on against Christians\r\nis given in Mr. Cocks’ letter, which corroborates the accounts received\r\nthrough the Roman Catholic channels, and is worthy of note as being\r\nwritten by one who evidently bore no great goodwill to that form of the\r\nChristian religion, and will render it unnecessary to allude further to\r\nthe fearful particulars detailed by Trigautius and others:\r\n\r\n“The persecution in this country, which before proceeded no further\r\nthan banishment and loss of civil and religious liberties, has since\r\n(as this letter tells us) run up to all the severities of corporal\r\npunishment. The Christians suffered as many sorts of deaths and\r\ntorments as those in the primitive persecutions; and such was their\r\nconstancy that their adversaries were sooner weary of inflicting\r\npunishments than they of enduring the effects of their rage. Very few,\r\nif any at all, renounced their profession; the most hideous forms in\r\nwhich death appeared (by the contrivance of their adversaries) would\r\nnot scare them, nor all the terrors of a solemn execution overpower\r\nthat strength of mind with which they seemed to go through their\r\nsufferings. They made their very children martyrs with them, and\r\ncarried them in their arms to the stake, choosing rather to resign them\r\nto the flames than leave them to the bonzes to be educated in the pagan\r\nreligion. All the churches which the last storm left standing this had\r\nentirely blown down and demolished, and heathen pagodas were erected\r\nupon their ruins.”\r\n\r\nEdict after edict emanated, or at least were said to emanate, from the\r\nShiogoon, ordering more and more severe action to be taken against the\r\nChristians. There remained no power of verifying these edicts, no one\r\nto speak a word at court for the unfortunate creatures; while they\r\nwere surrounded by hungry wolves, who might invent edicts in order to\r\nprofit by the confiscation of property, whose interest it was that the\r\ninfant heir should be destroyed with his father, and who were further\r\nincited by the priests, or bozangs, who gnashed their teeth in the\r\nhour of victory over enemies who had lorded it so proudly over them in\r\nthe short days of their prosperity. By such ferocity, combined with a\r\nstrict watch kept up on foreign vessels, the Christian religion was\r\nnearly extirpated; but in the district of Arima, nearly the whole of\r\nthe inhabitants, having all their lives professed Christianity, at last\r\nin desperation resolved rather to fight than submit to such a system of\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF IYEYAS\r\n\r\n\r\nIyeyas had shown himself an able commander, and an astute, if a\r\nsomewhat unscrupulous, diplomatist. He is known to this day as a\r\nlegislator. Hitherto the country seems to have been governed by the\r\nlaws of Tankaiko, and these are still in force. But Iyeyas thought it\r\nnecessary to lay down rules for those who formed his own court--the\r\nmilitary chiefs (with their two-sworded followers), whom he intended to\r\nact as the executive throughout the empire. He, to this end, issued one\r\nhundred rules or directions as his testament, to be bequeathed to his\r\ndescendants in power, as a guide to them in the office which he hoped\r\nwould be hereditary in his family. It is said that Iyeyas was assisted\r\nin drawing up this code by Nijio dono, Kon chi eeng, Tenkai sojo and\r\nKanga. The originals are now kept at the temple of Koo no san, and it\r\nis intended that no one but the ministers of state shall ever see them.\r\nThese rules are commonly called “Bookay hiak kadjo”--the hundred lines\r\nor rules for the military class. The title is Go yu i jowo or Yu i geng\r\nor gong--the last testament of Tosho goo, in one hundred sections.\r\n\r\nThe following translation of these rules is to be looked upon as a mere\r\nsketch, or such defective information as a Japanese who understood\r\nlittle English could convey to the author, who understood little\r\nJapanese, and the division into 100 sections is difficult to ascertain\r\nin the original.\r\n\r\n* No one is to act simply for the gratification of his own desires,\r\nbut he is to strive to do what may be opposed to his desires--_i.e._,\r\nto exercise self-control--in order that every one may be ready for\r\nwhatever he may be called upon by his superiors to do.\r\n\r\n* The aged, whether widowers or widows, and orphans, and persons\r\nwithout relatives, every one should assist with kindness and\r\nliberality, for justice to these four is the root of good government.\r\n\r\n* Respect the gods, keep the heart pure, and be diligent in business\r\nduring the whole life.\r\n\r\n* If the Kubosama (or Shiogoon) should die childless, then Ee, Honda,\r\nSakakibarra, and Sakai,[4] together with the older and most able\r\nservants of the Kubosama, are to meet together, and, no matter whether\r\nhe be distantly or nearly related, they are to fix upon the man most\r\nworthy, and of most merit, as successor.\r\n\r\n* Upon whomsoever the Mikado may confer the title of Se i shio goon, it\r\nis ordained that the customs shall continue as in the time of Kamakura\r\ndono (Yoritomo).\r\n\r\n* All the rice produce (cheegio) of the empire (at my disposal) amounts\r\nto 28,900,000 koku. Of this, I arrange that 20,000,000 is to be divided\r\namong the Daimios and Shomios or Hattamoto, and the remaining 8,900,000\r\nkoku shall belong to the Kubosama.\r\n\r\n* It is the duty of the Kubosama to guard from danger the Emperor and\r\nhis palace, and to preserve peace and tranquillity in the empire in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\n* All the Bookay--_i.e._, military officers--are to take care that the\r\nlaws of the empire are not lightly changed; but as sometimes necessity\r\nmay arise for a change, they may yield on special occasions.\r\n\r\n* All Daimios and Hattamotos who adhered to me and my cause up to\r\nthe time of the war at Osaka (with Hideyori) are to be Fudai. Those\r\nwho since that time have given in their adhesion, and have remained\r\nsteadfast, are Tozamma (Ch., ngoy yeong), outside lords. Of Tozamma\r\nthere are eighty-six, of Fudai eight thousand and twenty-three, and of\r\nKammong, or relations of my family, thirteen. Of visitors (lords who\r\nvisit Iyeyas on equal terms, called Okiaksama or Hin re-i), five, who\r\nare:\r\n\r\n  1. Kitsure gawa dono, }\r\n                        } descendants of Yoritomo.\r\n  2. Iwa matz manjiro,  }\r\n\r\n  3. Matzdarra Tajima no kami, who was the seventh son of Hideyas (elder\r\n  brother of Hidetada), and so grandson of Iyeyas. He was adopted by\r\n  Taikosama, but was returned to his father on the birth of Hideyori,\r\n  and was afterward adopted by Yuki.\r\n\r\n  4. Tatchibanna hida no kami--of a very old illustrious family. He\r\n  was military teacher of Iyaymitz ko, third Kubosama, and would not\r\n  acknowledge Iyeyas as his superior, but had not much power, and was\r\n  not disturbed by Iyeyas.\r\n\r\n  5. Tokungawa Mantokuji was a very old branch of the Tokungawa line.\r\n\r\n* Ko fhoo jo nai (a name of the shiro or castle of Yedo; the Chinese\r\ncharacters are different from the Ko fu of the province of Kahi, where\r\nthe Shiogoon has a castle) presents on the left side the shape of a\r\ndragon, on the right, that of an (washi) eagle; to the northwest lies\r\nthe second, Kuko or Maro; to the north lies the third; to the west, the\r\nfourth; to the southwest, the fifth.\r\n\r\nThe O ban goomi, or large guard of the Kubosama, consisting of\r\ntwelve companies, may be likened to the twelve gods (the Yakushi\r\nriorai). The Sho eeng bang--the lesser guard of ten companies--are\r\nlike the ten stars. The Dzeng koo or Sakitay (who lead the van in\r\nwar) are thirty-three companies, like the thirty-three heavens. The\r\nMochizutzu, musqueteers (who fire balls of five momays weight), are\r\nseven companies, like the Stchi wo or seven lights--the sun, moon and\r\nplanets. The Sho ban gashira, numbering twenty-eight, are similar to\r\nthe twenty-eight stars. The Ro shing--_i.e._ old servants (acting\r\nas the Gorogiu or cabinet)--are as the four heavens. Over them, and\r\nhigher, is placed the Shiogoon. These are all so arranged to suit\r\nwell-known and easily remembered arrangements in the Buddhist books of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n* There are many Fudai, but of this class the Mikawa, or old Fudai,\r\nare to rank the highest. Of these there are fourteen: 1, Tori yee; 2,\r\nItakura; 3, Owokubo; 4, Todda; 5, Honda; 6, Ogassawara; 7, Akimoto; 8,\r\nSakakibarra; 9, Sakkye; 10, Ishikawa; 11, Kooze; 12, Katto; 13, Abbe;\r\n14, ----. Of these families, if able men can be found among them, the\r\nGorogiu or cabinet is to be chosen. Tozamma Daimios, however able\r\nthey may be, cannot have seats in the Gorogiu, or take any part in\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n* The families and names of all Daimios, large and small, who have\r\nacted with me in my wars, shall continue (_i.e._, shall not be removed\r\nfrom the peerage), however badly they conduct themselves, unless they\r\nturn rebels or traitors.\r\n\r\n* In regard to the Koku shiu, Rio shiu, Jo shu (classes of Daimios--the\r\nfirst, lord of a province; the second, lord of a district; the third,\r\nlord of a castle), Tozamma and Fudai, if they break the laws and\r\noppress the people, no matter how old the line or how large their\r\nterritory, I will use my power and forces to brush them away from both\r\nterritory and castle. This is the duty of the Shiogoon alone.\r\n\r\n* Among officers the different ranks are to be observed, each according\r\nto his rank or his official income; but if they are equal in both, the\r\neldest in years shall take precedence.\r\n\r\n* The President of the Hio jo sho [a deliberative court in Yedo with\r\njudicial powers] must be selected as being a man of the clearest mind\r\nand best disposition; and once every month it shall be the duty of the\r\nShiogoon to go to the meeting, without giving previous notice of the\r\nday, when he himself must decide on the questions brought before him.\r\n\r\n* Each province is divided into kowori, sho, mura, and sato--districts,\r\nparishes, villages, and hamlets. In the mura and sato, should there be\r\nany family of old standing among the lower classes, even though the\r\nhead of it may be very poor, he ought to be appointed officer; and if\r\na rich man settles in the village, he is not to be made an officer.\r\nThis is to be the law in all territories, whether of a Koku shiu, Rio\r\nshiu, Jo shu, or Ji towo (ground-head, _i.e._, landed proprietor, not\r\neligible to office).\r\n\r\n* All Daimios and Hattamotos not in office (_i.e._, not residing at\r\nYedo), whether Tozamma or Fudai, are commanded not to be unjust toward\r\nme. My business is to guard the Emperor and his court and the whole\r\nempire of Japan, and I command you to assist me in repairing and\r\nkeeping up all the imperial castles, roads, rivers, and guards.\r\n\r\n* The repairing the Shiogoon’s residence, the keeping in repair public\r\nroads, keeping up ferries, etc., is Fushin; Daimios are sometimes\r\ncalled shokowo; when they are acting as guards, as in Kanagawa, they\r\nare “Katamme”; and in keeping up these guards, the whole expense is\r\nborne by the Daimios.\r\n\r\n* Irayzumi, the marking a criminal with ink or gunpowder; Go ku mong,\r\nputting a decapitated head in a box for exposure; Haritske, spearing\r\non a cross; Ushizaki, tying four oxen’s tails to a man’s limbs, and\r\nstarting them off by fire to tear off the limbs; Kumma iri, boiling a\r\ncriminal in hot water. These are old punishments for criminals. The\r\nofficers are to try to discover who are worthy men, and they are to be\r\nrewarded with territory, titles, and rank. Criminals are to be punished\r\nby branding (or marking), or beating, or tying-up, and, in capital\r\ncases, by spearing or decapitation; but the old punishments of tearing\r\nto pieces and boiling to death are not to be used.\r\n\r\n* When I was young I determined to fight and punish all my own and my\r\nancestors’ enemies, and I did punish them; but afterward, by deep\r\nconsideration, I found that the way of heaven was to help the people,\r\nand not to punish them. Let my successors follow out this policy, or\r\nthey are not of my line. In this lies the strength of the nation.\r\n\r\n* In regard to filling in new ground, if there are no objections, it\r\nmay be done according to the laws in force in the time of Yoritomo;\r\nbut if objections are made (by neighbors or others), it is not to be\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n* In case also of wishing to make new canals (hori), or lakes (Ikay),\r\nreservoirs of water, old precedents are to guide the officers.\r\n\r\n* If there be a lawsuit as to a property or a road, if it is shown to\r\nhave existed fifty years, the question cannot afterward be reopened.\r\n\r\n* Among officers outside and inside there are at times unseemly brawls\r\nas to rank, but these are all to be settled now, and I settle them\r\naccordingly in the following order:\r\n\r\nTai ro sin, Orussuee, Tai ro jiu (now Gorojiu), Soshi, Osaka jio dai,\r\nSoonpu riobang, Waka doshi yori, Soba yo nin, Kokay, Sosha, Jeesha\r\nboonyo, Oku toshi yori (obsolete), Nishi maro russui, Owo metske, Kotai\r\nyori yaï, Hira toshi yori (obsolete), Kanjo boonyo, Matchi boonyo,\r\nOku ko sho ngashira, Naka oku ko sho, Sho eeng ban gashira, O ban\r\ngashira, Shin ban gashira, Onando kashira, Ko nando kashira, Krii no ma\r\ntsu may bang, Gan no ma tsu may bang, Fuyo no ma yakunin, Tskyebang,\r\nKi roku sho yakunin and Hio moku no mono, Ten shoo bang, Hozo bang,\r\nHatta boonyo, Katana ban gashira, Motchi yumi ngashira, Motchi tsudzu\r\ngashira, Sakitay gashira, Yari boonyo, Kooshi boonyo, Ma ya betto,\r\nFunatay ngashira, Makanai gashira, Jusha, Eeshi, Fushing boonyo, Tan\r\nsz boonyo, Do bo ngashira, Zashiki bang, Hi no ban gashira, Katchi\r\nmetske gashira, Kobito gashira, Iga no kashira, Kurokwa kashira, Tayshi\r\ngashira. And below this rank, all the captains or officers of companies\r\nwill settle the ranks. When the official income is above 10,000 koku,\r\nthe Roshing or Gorogiu shall settle, below this the Waka toshi yori.\r\nThe highest of all is the So to rio, the Tai ro shin, or Go tai ro, or\r\nSosai; _i.e._, the Regent.\r\n\r\n* There are men who always say Yes (_i.e._, agree with me), and there\r\nare others who sometimes say No (_i.e._, express a different opinion\r\nfrom me). Now, the former I wish to put away from me, and the latter I\r\nwish to be near me. The elders of the Gorogiu are to examine and see\r\nthat men do not do such business only as is agreeable to them, and\r\navoid all that is the reverse. I wish to have about me all opinions of\r\nmen, both those who differ from me and those who agree with me.\r\n\r\n* If some man should say such a one deserves to be put to death, the\r\nofficers must not act upon his wish alone; but if all the people say\r\nsuch a one should be put to death, the officers must examine into the\r\ncase; and if all the people say such a one should be rewarded, I myself\r\nmust examine, or the country will be lost.\r\n\r\n* As to cormorant-fishing and hawking, some men used to say that these\r\namusements were useless and expensive, and they were in consequence\r\ninterdicted. But I do not prohibit them. They strengthen the body, and,\r\nwith riding, archery, hunting, and shooting, are not to be forgotten or\r\nomitted in time of peace by the military classes in the empire.\r\n\r\n* Singing, dancing, and music are not strictly military occupations,\r\nand soldiers ought not to devote themselves to these accomplishments;\r\nbut at times the mind is oppressed, and the heart is heavy, and\r\nrequires relaxation and mirth, and therefore these are not to be\r\naltogether prohibited.\r\n\r\n* I am descended from the Emperor Saywa Ten wo,[5] but my family had\r\nlost all its property through the power of our enemies, and had sunk\r\ndown to Matzdaira [a small village in Mikawa, from which the family of\r\nIyeyas takes its name]; but through the kindness of the Emperor I have,\r\nrelying upon documents and history, changed (or traced) the name of my\r\nfamily to Seratta, and Nitta, and Tokungawa, and in all time coming\r\nthis last is to remain the name of the family.\r\n\r\n* I have fought ninety battles, and narrowly escaped with my life\r\neighteen times. Having so escaped, I therefore out of gratitude erected\r\neighteen temples, and I wish my sons and descendants to adhere to the\r\nIodo sect (of Buddhists).\r\n\r\n* In Booffoo (the military office; _i.e._, Yedo) I built the temple\r\nof To yay san, and requested the Mikado to install as chief-priest a\r\nSinwo--_i.e._, of the royal family of the first rank (he is now known\r\nas Oo yay no mia, and is the most illustrious personage in Yedo in\r\npoint of birth and honors acceded to him: he lives in To yay zan, a\r\nresidence formerly the property of Toda, Idzumi no kami)--to pray that\r\nthe evil influences of the devil may be warded off, and that peace\r\nand prosperity may prevail over Japan. And also in order that if the\r\nMikado should be induced to side with traitors or foreigners, and these\r\nconcert with or gain possession of the person of the Mikado, then the\r\nDai Shiogoon shall install the Oo yay no mia as Mikado, and punish the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n* From ancient times there have been different sects of religion other\r\nthan the Jashiu (Crooked sect; _i.e._, Christians). Now any one of the\r\npeople can adhere to which he pleases (except the Christian); and there\r\nmust be no wrangling among sects, to the disturbance of the peace of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\n* The families of Minna moto, Taira, Fusiwara, Tatchibanna, Soongawara,\r\nOway, Ariwara, and Kiowara, are all direct descendants of Mikados. Out\r\nof these families the head of the military must be chosen. If there be\r\namong these families men of good character, but uneducated, cowardly,\r\nand ignorant of the way of holiness, such are not to be selected for\r\nthis office. Therefore it is necessary that all the members of these\r\nfamilies should be diligent in study.\r\n\r\n* To insure the empire peace, the foundation must be laid in the ways\r\nof holiness and religion; and if men think they can be educated, and\r\nwill not remember this, it is as if a man were to go to a forest to\r\ncatch fish, or thought he could draw water out of fire. They must\r\nfollow the ways of holiness.\r\n\r\n* All men are liable to sickness. If doctors become rich they grow\r\nindolent, therefore it is improper that they should acquire territory\r\nor landed property, but they are to be paid by every one, high and low,\r\naccording to the visits paid.\r\n\r\n* Those who study the stars, and the higher orders of Sinto priests,\r\nformerly spread the idea that they were worthy of equal reverence with\r\nthe gods. If in future they presume to do so, they are to be punished.\r\n\r\n* In former times, when high-priests and ministers of the Buddhist\r\nreligion committed crimes, and were liable to punishment, the people\r\nthought that to punish them was the same as punishing the gods. They\r\nare to think so no more, but the military officers are to punish such\r\noffenders without fear.\r\n\r\n* Booffoo, Osaggi, Booggi, Itchiko Meeko, Nobooshi, Yamabooshi, Gozay\r\n[these are different kinds of impostors, fortune-tellers, diviners, fox\r\nmagicians, mesmerizers, clairvoyants, etc.], Maykura, and vagabonds\r\nwho go about without regular business and breaking the laws, raising\r\nquarrels, must all be punished.\r\n\r\n* Let every gentleman with the right to wear a long sword remember that\r\nhis sword is to be as his soul, and that he is not to part from it but\r\nwith his life. If he forget his sword he must be punished.\r\n\r\n* In the Nengo of Boon ro ku, 1592-96, the two officers Ogochi and\r\nAssano surveyed all Japan. They made a report, which was laid before\r\nthe Emperor. A survey of the provinces, counties, districts and\r\nparishes was made, together with the forests, mountains, rivers,\r\nand a calculation was made of the value. If a man possess land\r\nyielding 1,000 koku, he is to provide five horsemen. If 10,000, 50\r\nhorsemen. If 50,000, 250 horsemen. If 100,000 koku, 1,000 horsemen.\r\nThis is one “goon” or regiment. 3,000 horsemen make one battalion,\r\nover which is placed one general or Jo sho. Over 2,000 is placed a\r\nLieutenant-general, or Chiu sho. Over 1,000 is placed a Kasho, or\r\nMajor-general [all this is altered now]. But I have a regard for old\r\ncustoms and long service, therefore the house of Ee shall be over\r\nall the generals. Ee man chiu was my general, therefore I presented\r\nhim with a gold Sai hae [a baton like a fan, used by high military\r\nofficers]; and I made Honda “Kasho,” and gave him a paper Sai hae.\r\nThe above arrangement all military officers are to make themselves\r\nacquainted with.\r\n\r\n* If disputes arise as to the boundaries of the territories (Rioboong\r\nof Daimios or of Hattamoto), these are to be referred to an Owometske\r\nand the Kanjo boonyo, the head of the Treasury. But if the disputants\r\nrefuse to abide by the decision, and fighting ensues, the ground in\r\ndispute shall be confiscated by the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\n* Byshings (Ch., Peichin)--_i.e._, large retainers of Daimios--even if\r\nthey have large landed possessions, and are equal in wealth to Daimios,\r\nare not on the same footing with Jiki shing (_i.e._, retainers of the\r\nShiogoon), and are always inferior to the latter in rank, even though\r\nsuperior in wealth.\r\n\r\n* In fights among the common people, even if two or three are killed\r\non one side, both parties are to be looked upon as criminal, and to be\r\npunished, but not so severely as if a man out of forethought murders\r\nanother, and does not act on the heat of the moment.\r\n\r\n* If a man employs another to commit a murder, if a man poisons, and\r\nwishes to make profit or advantage to himself out of a murder, or if a\r\nthief murders to steal, such men must be discovered, even if the grass\r\nof all Japan is looked through.\r\n\r\n* Of the four employments in Japan--the Samurai, two-sworded gentlemen;\r\nthe Hyaksho, the farmer; Shokonini, artisan; and the Akindo,\r\nmerchant--the Samurai is the first in rank. If one of the other three\r\nare rude in conduct to a Samurai, he himself can punish him. But among\r\nSamurai there are different ranks, some being Jiki shing, others\r\nByshing, retainers of the Shiogoon and retainers of Daimios, and others\r\nservants of Byshings, who also are Kimi and Shing, master and servant.\r\nIf among any of these an inferior is rude or impolite or insolent, then\r\nhe is to be treated as if he were an Akindo; _i.e._, a merchant.\r\n\r\n* That one man and one woman should live together is a great law of\r\nnature, therefore at the age of sixteen all men and women ought to be\r\nmarried. But no man is allowed to marry a woman of the same surname\r\nwith himself, but examination must be made as to the parentage and line\r\nof descent of the betrothed, and thus the way of heaven will be adhered\r\nto.\r\n\r\n* If a man have no son he may adopt one, but the father must be fifteen\r\nyears of age before he adopts a son. If a Daimio or Hattamoto have no\r\nson or adopted son, the line becomes extinct. But if the last heir of\r\na Daimio’s family be very delicate and sickly, he may, even if young,\r\nadopt a child to keep up the line of the house. This is the way of\r\nConfucius.\r\n\r\n* (In old times the Mikado went round the provinces.) Hereafter an\r\nofficer must go round all the provinces once every five or seven years,\r\nand make a report to the Shiogoon. (This is now obsolete.)\r\n\r\n* As to the old Kokoshu, I will not interfere with their provinces; but\r\nin the case of recently made Kokoshu and Daimios, if they keep the same\r\nterritory for a very long time, they become proud, and oppress the\r\npeople, therefore in the case of these latter it is well to change them\r\noccasionally from one territory to another.\r\n\r\n* Among Hyaksho, Shokonin, and Akindo--_i.e._, farmers, artisans, and\r\nmerchants--if their wives secretly commit adultery, the law of nature\r\nis broken; and whether the husband report the matter to the officers\r\nor not is of no consequence, both parties must be punished; but if the\r\nhusband is a proper spirited man, and puts the adulterer to death, he\r\nis not to be punished. But if he should wish to pardon both the wife\r\nand her paramour, it may be done. The judge is not to be hasty.\r\n\r\n* If the same thing take place in the family of a Samurai, the judge\r\nmust be very severe and strict in punishing.\r\n\r\n* In Japan there is an old saying that the same heaven cannot cover\r\na man and the enemy (murderer?) of his father or mother or master or\r\nelder brother. Now, if a man seek to put to death such an enemy, he\r\nmust first inform the Kets dan sho [this is a department which takes\r\ncognizance of criminal matters] office at the Hio jo sho, and say in\r\nhow many days or months he can carry out his intention. This is to be\r\nentered in the book of the office. If he kills this enemy without such\r\nprevious intimation, he is to be considered as a murderer.\r\n\r\n* If a servant kills his master, he is to be considered as the same\r\nas the Emperor’s enemy, and his relations are all likewise to be\r\nconsidered in the same light, and must be extirpated root and branch.\r\nIf a servant has made the attempt, even if unsuccessful, the family is\r\nto be extirpated.--Kando is to take the name of a family out of the\r\nbook of Japan.\r\n\r\n* In regard to wives and concubines, the law and customs are the same\r\nas between master and servant. The Mikado is allowed twelve concubines.\r\nDaimios and Hattamotos are allowed to have eight. Tei fu--_i.e._, men\r\nwith titles--and Sho daibu are allowed five. Officers and Samurai are\r\nallowed two concubines. This is to be found in the old holy books of\r\nthe Rai ki rites and ceremonies (Lei, king of China). At times very\r\nfoolish and bad men have made the way to the Rai ki dark, and have\r\naddicted themselves to numerous concubines, and so broken the laws of\r\nnature. In former times, whenever Daimios or officers have lost their\r\nterritories and castles, it may in nearly all cases be traced to this\r\ncause. Hence the man is not upright who is much given to women.\r\n\r\n[It is a common error with writers upon Japan to allege that the\r\nJapanese are indifferent to the respectability of their wives; and,\r\nindeed, that they rather prefer to take one from among the public\r\ncourtesans; and, further, to convey the impression that nearly all\r\nthe women of the country go through some such course before marriage.\r\nSuch an idea is contrary to common sense as well as to propriety; and\r\nthe common belief that the spirits take a warm interest and perform\r\nan important part in the marriage of every pair in Japan shows that\r\nthe rite itself is looked upon as a very important institution,\r\nrequiring Divine sanction and blessing, and not to be lightly entered\r\nupon for the gratification of temporary or transient feelings. On the\r\nother hand, intercourse between parties not married is looked upon\r\nas disreputable, or at least an attempt is made to convey such an\r\nimpression to young persons. All such connections are called “damass\r\nkoto,” _i.e._, a false, a sham affair; and it is said of such persons\r\nthat the fox--_i.e._, the devil--has tied the yeng or knot. It is a\r\ncommon saying by youths, “I know that it is damass koto; but the fox\r\nalways brings us together again, and I cannot cut the thread.” As their\r\nidea of the yeng is taken from the Chinese, it shows that polygamy\r\nis not, with that large portion of the human race, looked on with\r\napproval. In China the first wife is the only wife; the others who may\r\nbe taken afterward are concubines. In these countries the position of\r\na prostitute is different from what it is in Christian communities, as\r\nthey are forced to the life, and educated to it from childhood; and the\r\neducation and mixing with the world in conversation gives them often a\r\ncleverness and power of pleasing which are often wanting in the ladies\r\nbrought up in the quiet and seclusion of a Chinese family. Besides,\r\nthey go to the same churches and worship the same gods, going through\r\ntheir devotions as religiously as the rest of the community.]\r\n\r\n* The relations of the husband are with external things, those of\r\nthe wife with internal. The observance of this leads to the peace or\r\nsmooth-working of the empire. If these relations are changed, folly\r\nensues, the house is deranged, and it is as if a hen were to crow in\r\nthe morning. All men are to take care to avoid the beginning of this\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n* At Iwatski, and at Kawagoi in Musashi, and at Sakura and Seki yado\r\nand Koga in Simosa, and at Takasaki and Oossuee in Kowotsuki, and at\r\nOotsu no mia in Shimo tsuki, and at Odawara in Segami, nine places are\r\nto be castles, which are as the guards or outposts of Yedo. The Daimios\r\nin possession of these castles are to act in unison with Yedo as a\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\n* At the castles of Soonpu and Kunowo there must be placed able\r\ncommanders, as these places are the keys of Yedo; to Osaka in Setsu and\r\nFushimi in Yamashiro, officers of the fourth rank must be sent, and an\r\nable Fudai Daimio, besides twelve captains. If war begins, Osaka and\r\nFusimi are the keys of the country.\r\n\r\n* To the Nijio castle of the Kubosama at Miako one of the principal\r\nFudai must be sent, who must be a general, because he is the head of\r\nthe executive at Miako, and has the direction of the San jiu san koku;\r\n_i.e._, the thirty-three provinces west of Miako.\r\n\r\n* In the provinces round Yedo there are sixteen gates where travelers\r\nare examined. At each of these gates a Fudai must be stationed, to see\r\nthat the laws are observed, and that not a spear the size of a needle\r\npasses toward Yedo, but pack-horses and carriages may pass.\r\n\r\n* The office of Kiusiu Tandai (the Viceroy of the island of Kiusiu)\r\nwas formerly held by the Owotomo family. Since this family has been\r\ndestroyed, the office has been in abeyance. I now command Shim adzu\r\nand Nabeshima (Satsuma and Fizen) each to act as Viceroy in alternate\r\nyears, and will not permit any other to fill the office.\r\n\r\n* Within the castle of Yedo are twenty-eight places or gates (Bansho or\r\nMitskay), with guards; without there are twenty-eight. Those within the\r\ncastle are to be kept by Fudai, those outside by Tozamma.\r\n\r\n* In regard to San kin [those who are officially on duty in Yedo]\r\nofficers, care must be taken to note such as are diligent and such as\r\nare indolent, and they are to be rewarded or punished accordingly.\r\nThose who are rich are to be put into situations entailing expense, and\r\nthose who are poor into the less expensive.\r\n\r\n* All the Daimios on duty in Yedo are not to be employed\r\nsimultaneously, as some may be suddenly required for extraordinary\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n* Foreign ships are allowed to come to Nagasaki. Old and trustworthy\r\nofficers are to be sent there. The kimbang or guards are to be four\r\ncaptains, whose official income shall be more than 3,000 kokus each.\r\nThere are to be both foot and horse soldiers. As the expenses are\r\ngreat there, the Yakunins or officers must receive yaku rio; _i.e._,\r\nadditional money according to their business.\r\n\r\n* As by convulsions of nature, such as earthquakes, the courses\r\nof rivers are changed, lakes are made or dried up, and mountains\r\noverthrown, the expense of repairing these ravages and paying the\r\nlaborers is to be borne by all Daimios in proportion to their revenues.\r\n\r\n* In all the empire the main roads are to be six keng wide (or about\r\nsixty feet[6]). Cross-roads are to be three mats wide or eighteen feet;\r\nYoko mitchi, or bridle-paths, two mats; Katchi mitchi, walking paths,\r\none mat or six feet; Sakuba mitchi or tchika mitchi, less than three\r\nfeet. On either side of a ferry landing, ground is to be left to the\r\nwidth of sixty mats, or 360 feet, so that when many persons may collect\r\ncare may be taken. This is the custom as to ferries ever since the time\r\nof my ancestor, Nitta, Oee no skay, Yoshi shige, Nioo do, called “Josay\r\ndono.”\r\n\r\n* All the revenues arising from rates levied at ferries, lakes, hills,\r\netc., are not to be used by the military department, but are reserved\r\nfor the Mikado’s treasury.\r\n\r\n* It is not allowed to any one to build a house in the middle of\r\nwheat or rice fields, as the shadow of the house and trees spoils the\r\nsurrounding ground, and renders it unproductive. If any dare so to\r\nbuild, all the building is to be swept away, and he is to be confined\r\nfor 100 days.\r\n\r\n* For the settlement of what is old plantation and what is new, it is\r\ndecided that Furui yama, or old trees, are those which at the level of\r\nthe eye are three feet or more in circumference. Atarashi yama, or new\r\nplantations, are trees which are less than three feet at the level of\r\nthe eye.--At one time this was a source of great trouble in Japan.\r\n\r\n* If a large tree overshadows a neighbor’s house or drying-floor, so\r\nthat rice, grain or wheat cannot be exposed to the sun, when necessary\r\nthe branches may be cut off.\r\n\r\n* Every year the Kanjo sho is to send in a report of bad bridges,\r\nroads, etc., in need of repair.\r\n\r\n* In the good old-fashioned times the relations of master and servant\r\nwere like those of water and fish, but now, in these times, people\r\nare apt to become proud and to dislike their work, but every one is\r\nto do faithfully the work assigned to him, and not to throw his work\r\nor duties on another. This is very important to be remembered, and is\r\nnot difficult to be learned. The result is like water flowing down\r\nencircling the country, at which all the people rejoice.\r\n\r\n* Honcho, or Japan, is the (Shin koku) country of spirits. Therefore\r\nwe have among us the Jiu (Confucianism), Shaku (Buddhist), Sen (Ch.,\r\nTseen), Do (Taouist), and other sects. If we leave our gods (Shin),\r\nit is like refusing the wages of our master and taking them from\r\nanother. Therefore a watch is to be kept as to this. But as to Itchiko\r\n(divination) and Buddhistic practices, the workers are not to be driven\r\naway, but the people are not to follow them.\r\n\r\n* In regard to dancing-women, prostitutes, brothels, night work, and\r\nall other improper employments, all these are like caterpillars or\r\nlocusts in the country. Good men and writers in all times have written\r\nagainst them. But as it is a law of nature that man should desire the\r\nsociety of woman, it is enacted that these people and places shall not\r\nbe tolerated; but as it would, if the laws were rigidly carried out, be\r\na perpetual punishing and nothing else, they are not to be administered\r\nseverely, but out of a regard for the uneducated and the nature of\r\nmankind these offenses are to be lightly passed over.\r\n\r\n* It has been the wont of my ancestors ever to follow out the thread\r\nof the customs of (Yoritomo) Kamakura dono, and no other customs are\r\nto be observed. But the heart and goodness of Hige mori (Komatzu dono,\r\neldest son of Kio mori) is never to be forgotten.--This refers to the\r\nsteady opposition made by him to the “mauvais desseins” of his father,\r\nKio mori, against the family of Yoritomo in 1170-80 A.D. He is called\r\nin the “Annales des Empereurs” “homme habile, vertueux, et juste.” He\r\nwas extremely distressed at hearing of the treachery of his father in\r\ninviting the regent to a conference, and then ordering him to be cut\r\nto pieces. After his death, Kio mori, seeing no one to oppose him,\r\nregardless of everything, acted according to his own pleasure.\r\n\r\n* When a master dies, his servants think it their duty to commit\r\nsuicide. This is an old custom, but it is quite unreasonable, and\r\nnothing can justify a man in so acting. Sometimes, instead of\r\ncommitting suicide, there is a custom of putting into the grave figures\r\nrepresenting servants. This is more unreasonable than the other. Such\r\npersons are not upright, and those who in future do these things must\r\nbe severely punished.\r\n\r\n* If war arise, the (Taisho) commander-in-chief has no other business\r\nbut to mold men to his use. The master of men must know what each\r\nis useful for. Men are like instruments--one cannot do the work of a\r\nchisel with a hammer; one cannot make a small hole with a saw, but a\r\ngimlet must be used. The principle is the same as to men. Men with\r\nbrains are to be used for work requiring brains; men of strong frame\r\nfor work requiring strength; men of strong heart for work requiring\r\ncourage. Weak men are to be put into poor places. Every man in his\r\nproper place. There are places for weak men and places for fools. All\r\nthis must be regulated by the head and brains of the Taisho. Soldiers\r\nare to be chosen on these principles, so that with a thousand men in\r\none body, the whole may act together, and the empire have peace. This\r\nis always to be kept in memory.\r\n\r\n* If one man rises to be full of, or puffed up with, military power\r\n(Boo i ippai), he will try to make himself equal with or superior to\r\nthe highest, the Mikado. This is a very serious error; there is always\r\na tendency to it. But when it happens, it is natural that he should\r\nbecome proud, and not respect the Mikado. The land of spirits--_i.e._,\r\nJapan--will be lost. The judgment of Heaven will assuredly fall upon\r\nhim.--This is intended for his successors, the Shiogoons, who might be\r\npuffed up with their position.\r\n\r\n* The Sinwo kay and Mia gata--_i.e._, the families of those of the\r\nroyal blood--are the supporters of the Mikado. All the high ranks of\r\nthe Mikado’s court, the Koongyo and the Koongays, are not to alter\r\nthe old laws of the empire, but are to pay the highest respect to the\r\nMikado, and are not to be rude or insolent.\r\n\r\n* As to the Hinrei Skiaku [the descendants of old Shiogoons, such as\r\nAshikanga, Hojio and others, to whom rank and territory have been\r\nassigned], their history and pedigree are to be inscribed in a book.\r\nWhat their customs may be is of no consequence to me, but if they\r\ninterfere with the laws or the government established by me, or even if\r\nthey become very proud and oppress the people, I will punish them.\r\n\r\n* As to Nagoya, Wakayama and Mito [known now as Owarri, Kii and Mito,\r\nthe San kay, or “three families,” sons of Iyeyas], and the fifteen\r\nKammong, the heir must always be the eldest son, and the territory of\r\neach cannot be divided among two or three sons.\r\n\r\n* Daimios with incomes of 100,000 koku, and the Roshin or Gorojiu, and\r\nofficers upon outside business, and all captains of the guards, are to\r\nbe of the same rank as Kokushu.\r\n\r\n* In regard to Fudai and Tozamma, and wealthy retainers of Daimios\r\n(Byshings and Karo), in going from and returning to Yedo they must\r\nobserve the laws of the road, and they are not to make their trains\r\nvery splendid or very poor--_i.e._, a man of large income is not to go\r\nwith a very splendid train, neither is a man with small income to go\r\nwith a very meager retinue; and they are not, as if they were puffed\r\nup, and to show their military power, to give trouble to the hotels, or\r\noppress the coolies and porters on the road. This is to be notified to\r\nDaimios each time they come to Yedo.\r\n\r\n* As to ships, the sea, rivers, roads, porters, horses, the rates\r\nare now all settled for greater or shorter distances, and also as to\r\nweights to be carried; but all government carriage is to be done with\r\nthe greatest expedition, regardless of expense.\r\n\r\n* All San kin (those Daimios officially resident in Yedo) are to make a\r\npresent (or rather pay a tax) to the Gorogiu, and to the under officers\r\nof state. Those whose incomes exceed 10,000 koku are to give gold, or\r\nkin badai--_i.e._, gold instead of a horse; if below 10,000 koku, they\r\ngive silver (gin badai) to each of the high officers. Wealthy Daimios,\r\nwith large official incomes, are to give much, those with small incomes\r\nare to give little. This money the Gorogiu is to appropriate to the\r\nexpenses of the office.\r\n\r\n* Among the servants of the Shiogoon are those who have much ability\r\nand influence, and those who have little of either; they are to act\r\ntogether, and mutually to assist one another. By this means the\r\ngovernment will work smoothly. Men must be divided according to their\r\nabilities and dispositions, but they must be rewarded or punished\r\naccording to their actions.\r\n\r\n* When I built the Danring (eighteen temples) before mentioned, I put,\r\n_or_ I made them, San mong (hill-doors). [The San mong temple of Hiyay\r\nsan near Miako is a copy of the Tien Tai shan of China.] The Ten dai no\r\nzass (head of the Buddhists) asked me why I had built these San mong or\r\nhill-doors, saying that he was the same as the center of heaven, and\r\nhad his seat upon the three stars (San tai say, three sets of stars).\r\nI returned no answer. Now it is my wish that long life may be given\r\nto the Mikado (10,000 years); therefore in the sixty-six provinces I\r\nbuilt seventy-three. I have written in a book the names and numbers\r\nof these temples, and have sent this to the temple of Ten dai san (in\r\nMiako), therefore be it known that no other San mong temple is to be\r\nbuilt.--This San mong must allude to some kind of Buddhist temples of\r\nthat name.\r\n\r\n* All oo rin kay (military) officers and others under the Shiogoon\r\nhave since the time of Kamakura dono (Yoritomo) received a commission\r\nfrom the Mikado. All these are under the commands of the Shiogoon. The\r\nbusiness is the same as that of the Jin nee kang, office of the gods in\r\nold time. Therefore, when a death occurs in my palace, or among those\r\nwho come to my residence (_i.e._, Yedo), the customs of the Jin nee\r\nkang are to be observed.--The custom is to consider, when a death takes\r\nplace in a house, all connected with it as temporarily unclean. In the\r\nEmperor’s family women at certain times move to another house; when\r\na child is born, the father and mother are considered unclean for a\r\ntime, and cannot go to office or to a temple; when a death takes place,\r\npersons entering a house either do not take off their shoes, or put on\r\nothers for the purpose, and there should be neither smoking, eating,\r\nnor drinking in the house for three days.\r\n\r\n* If a man neglects his duties and gives himself up to gambling and\r\ndrinking, and thinks that because he is of rank he may do so, and so\r\nseduce others beneath him to the same practices; if such a one has\r\nnot been taught that such conduct is wrong by his teacher, it shall be\r\nconsidered the teacher’s crime; but if he has been taught, he himself\r\nshall be considered the offender, and dealt with accordingly; but in\r\nthese offenses there are great differences in degree, and some are to\r\nbe punished severely, others lightly.\r\n\r\n* Men are prone to become indolent and lazy at work, and in consequence\r\nbecome thieves, breaking the laws and occasioning trouble; all these\r\nmust be severely punished by death; and if any one sets houses on fire,\r\nforges seals or signatures, poisons, coins false money--such shall be\r\neither burned alive or be speared on a cross.\r\n\r\n* A government can easily gather information as to what men do in\r\ntheir business, but as to what they think in their hearts it is more\r\ndifficult. Kamakura dono, in reference to this, followed the customs\r\nof the Tong dynasty of China, and had recourse to informers, offering\r\nrewards to such as should give information as to evil-disposed persons.\r\n\r\n* In regard to the Go koku, or five grains--_i.e._, grain of every\r\nkind--if these are not abundant, the way of the government of the\r\nEmperor is obscure. If crime abounds, the Shiogoon shows himself\r\ndestitute of executive energy. He himself must be active and diligent\r\nin his own duties.\r\n\r\n* The higher men (? nobility) make the laws, and the lower classes\r\nfollow and obey; but it is sometimes difficult to act up to the rules\r\nlaid down, therefore men of rank are not to order one thing and do\r\nanother themselves, but are to take care that they carry out what they\r\nprofess, and observe the laws which they lay down.\r\n\r\n* In regard to Kokushu (territorial princes, or lords of a province)\r\nand Jo shiu (larger Daimios), if they act in such a way as if not to\r\namount to crime, still may be deserving of censure, they cannot be\r\npunished personally, but they are to be ordered to carry out some\r\nexpensive undertaking for the benefit of the country.--Such as making a\r\nfort; that at Kanagawa was thus made by Oki no kami.\r\n\r\n* Upon the death of the Kinri (the Emperor), or Sento (retired\r\nEmperor), or the Emperor’s wife or near relative, all music and shows\r\nof pleasure are to cease for a time. If one of the San ko (either the\r\nOo- or Sa- or Nai-daijin) dies, or the Dai shiogoon, notice shall be\r\ngiven of how many days this cessation shall be.--Mourning for the\r\nEmperor lasts for thirteen months.\r\n\r\n* When a new Emperor ascends the throne, the expenses are all to be\r\nundertaken by me, the Shiogoon, and in these I must be liberal.\r\n\r\n* If any representative of a foreign nation comes to the country, the\r\nofficers must take care that everything is in good order--that horses\r\nand horse-furniture be good, the houses and roads clean. If they are\r\ndirty, it can be seen at a glance whether the nation is prosperous or\r\nthe reverse.\r\n\r\n* If a foreign vessel should be wrecked on the shore of Japan,\r\nthe officers of government are to be immediately informed, and an\r\ninterpreter is to be sent to ask what they require. Sometimes the\r\nofficers may require to be strict and severe, at other times hospitable\r\nand kind. The vessel is to be watched, and no trading allowed.\r\n\r\n* It is said that the Mikado, looking down on his people, loves them\r\nas a mother does her children. The same may be said of me and of my\r\ngovernment. This benevolence of mind is called Jin. This Jin may be\r\nsaid to consist of five parts; these are humanity, integrity, courtesy,\r\nwisdom and truth. Therefore I have divided the government into Tozamma,\r\nFudai, Shing and Sso. This mode of government is according to the way\r\nof heaven. This I have done to show that I am impartial, and am not\r\nassisting my own relations and friends only. Between the Shing and Sso\r\nit is improper that there should be any communications, and therefore\r\nthey are not to be in correspondence with each other.\r\n\r\n* If punishments and rewards are distributed unjustly, upright men\r\nwill disappear. The people will become timid and niggardly. Therefore\r\nit is of the utmost importance that there be not the smallest act of\r\ninjustice committed by government officers.\r\n\r\nThese laws have not been made recently by me, but have existed from\r\ngeneration to generation in the Minnamoto family. What I have written\r\nis like a reflection in a mirror. The arrow, if it does not pierce the\r\nbull’s-eye, will perhaps strike the target.\r\n\r\nOld customs must, when found good on examination, be retained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principles and sentiments, and at times the very words of these\r\nlaws, seem to be taken from the writings of the old sages of China,\r\nConfucius and Mencius. Confucius, in the Chung yung, seems to have\r\nbeen the model after which the code was drawn up. It is founded upon\r\nthe five duties of universal obligation--that of a sovereign and\r\nminister, of a father and son, of husband and wife, of elder and\r\nyounger brothers, and between friends; and upon the principle that the\r\nadministration of government lies in getting proper men, and that such\r\nare to be obtained by means of the ruler’s own character.\r\n\r\nThe idea of turning to look inward and examine one’s self is prominent\r\nin the writings of Mencius.\r\n\r\nMencius said people have this common saying--“The empire, the state,\r\nthe family. The root of the empire is the state--the root of the state\r\nis in the family--the root of the family is in the person of its head.”\r\nAnd Iyeyas seems to have recognized these principles as the foundation\r\nof his rule, believing that when too much weight is given to the\r\nstate, despotism ensues; when the family preponderates, oligarchy of\r\nan aristocracy prevails; and where the interests of the individual man\r\nbecome paramount, democracy rears its head.\r\n\r\nThose who framed the code were in all probability acquainted with the\r\nwritings of the Chinese sages and their commentators, and perhaps they\r\nrefer, in the allusions to Kamakura dono or Yoritomo, to some laws\r\nlaid down by him or his officers, who had more opportunity of studying\r\nthe Chinese writings than could fall to the lot of men who had been\r\nbrought up in the troublous times when Iyeyas was a youth.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of such laws laid down by Iyeyas, and which are more\r\nor less still in force, leads to a comparison with the condition of\r\nEurope during the time when feudal institutions were in force, the\r\ngenius of these laws being in many respects the counterpart of that\r\nwhich was in force in Europe in feudal times. The constitution of\r\nall warlike nations in early times has tended to this condition. The\r\ndiscoveries of gunpowder and printing have been the great means of\r\nbreaking down this system; and in our day steam is rapidly breaking up\r\nwhat these had left.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom had been given the most capacity for dealing with men\r\nand for conducting war, was selected to take the command of those who\r\nsaw these qualities in him, and confided in his ability to prosecute\r\nany undertaking to a successful termination. Of necessity such a man\r\nmust be a soldier. He must have the capacity to govern as well as to\r\nfight; to make laws as well as to lead in battle; to conciliate men as\r\nwell as to control them. He divides the spoils among his followers,\r\nallowing to each a proportion according to his merit.\r\n\r\nA larger portion was retained by the chief, because, independently of\r\nbeing able to appropriate it, he was to rule over all, and to incur\r\nexpenses on behalf of all in the general control of the acquired\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThis chief generally retained in his own hand certain privileges,\r\nsuch as a more or less controlling voice in the legislature, power of\r\nlife and death, and of making peace or war and treaties of commerce,\r\ncoinage of money, right of property in mines of gold and silver, and\r\nother rights. He had the power of conferring some of these on the\r\nbarons holding land from him and under him as superior. By subdivision\r\na feudal kingdom was cut up into many small but semi-independent\r\nbaronies. The execution of legal decisions became difficult, offenders\r\nescaping to other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nThrough the greater expenses falling upon the king, his power often\r\nwaned, while that of the barons waxed greater; and to render their\r\nindependence perpetual, and at the same time to assure a support to the\r\nchief, the system of entail was fallen upon.\r\n\r\nThe barons were ever and again adding to their property and power by\r\nmarriages, by successions, by purchase, or by force and might. Honors\r\nand even offices became hereditary.\r\n\r\nSo long as weapons of war were in each man’s possession, and every one\r\nwas in proportion to his personal strength and activity a soldier, no\r\ngreat expense fell upon the chief. His followers could be summoned at\r\nan hour’s notice.\r\n\r\nBut when the introduction of gunpowder rendered personal strength\r\nand activity of comparatively small value, it increased the expense\r\nfalling upon the leader. Trained skill required time, and education\r\nwas necessary. Large guns, requiring expensive ammunition, called for\r\na more expensive system of fortification. The lesser barons could not\r\nundertake these. The expenses of war fell entirely upon the king.\r\nTrained soldiers required a standing army. When there is any coast to\r\ndefend, a navy is required.\r\n\r\nIn the practical working of the system of Iyeyas, there was the\r\ndifference between Japan and European countries, that, until the use of\r\nsteam, she had no neighbors to dread as foes or to covet as vassals.\r\nThere was always an attempt to compensate for the want of this external\r\npressure in the duality or separation of interests between the Mikado,\r\nthe fountain of honors, and the executive, by whatever name the head\r\nofficer might be called, whether Kwanrei or Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nSecurity was sought for by the laws of Iyeyas, not against external\r\nfoes, but against the decadence of the dynasty from internal weakness,\r\nor from the power of those who ought to be supporters becoming\r\noverwhelming. There was in Japan no call for great expenses, either in\r\nkeeping up fortifications, armaments, or a standing army or navy. No\r\nembassadors were dispatched to foreign courts, to consume the revenues\r\nof the empire. Against the tendency to the aggrandizement of the\r\nbarons, and their increase in wealth and power by marriage and other\r\nmeans, Iyeyas fixed the amount of territory which each lord was to\r\npossess. Land which produced of rice annually a certain quantity was\r\nallotted to each baron, according to his rank or rights. But one great\r\ndifference between this system and that of entails in Europe lay in\r\nthis, that the estate granted to each baron could not be added to or\r\ndiminished, either by marriage or by purchase or by might, except by\r\nexpress permission and grant from the Shiogoon, the superior of all.\r\nThis law tended to prevent the enormous accumulation of land in a few\r\nhands. This land they might lease or grant to their retainers, some of\r\nwhom were very wealthy; but so long as such a one was a retainer of a\r\nDaimio, whatever his wealth might be, there was little chance of his\r\nrising to honors in the state.\r\n\r\nThe barons in Japan are bound to bring a certain number of men to\r\nassist the lord superior in war. Each of these followers is paid by the\r\nbaron by so much land producing a certain quantity of rice.\r\n\r\nSuccession to these lands is hereditary, but not strictly to the eldest\r\nson, while the custom so common over the East of adoption is allowed,\r\nand all the rights of a son are conferred upon the adopted one. Many\r\nof the present Daimios are adopted children--frequently no relative\r\nwhatever of the person who so adopts. But while Iyeyas declared that\r\nthese fiefs should be hereditary, he at the same time laid it down as\r\na principle that it was good that these lesser lords should not remain\r\ntoo long in one place, but that, when occasion seemed to require it,\r\nit was well to change them from one barony to another. He would no\r\ndoubt have gladly laid down a similar principle as to the Kokushu, or\r\nlords of provinces, but their power and influence were too great to\r\nbe lightly interfered with. This power has been frequently put forth\r\ndown to the present time. A Daimio with an income of 10,000 koku is\r\nordered to remove to the territory of another with the same revenue;\r\nor perhaps, if there be some cause for reproof, a Daimio will be\r\ntransferred to a territory in the far north, such as Tanagura, and\r\nthe baron then living there, who may be the son of one who had been\r\nsimilarly deported, is removed to the better locality.\r\n\r\nIyeyas provided for the payment of stated presents on arrival at Yedo.\r\nAt other times gifts are made to the Shiogoon; and, as under the feudal\r\nsystem, presents are to be offered on other occasions, such as marriage\r\nor becoming of age.\r\n\r\nThe civil authority of the Shiogoon was liable to much limitation, and\r\nthis Iyeyas seems to have expected. At first an officer was deputed\r\nby the Shiogoon to reside in the territories of the greater barons,\r\nand to report to Yedo when he saw anything taking place worthy of\r\nanimadversion. But this has been done away with, and the Kokushu are\r\nvirtually in full possession of power, each in his own provincial\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nUnder the laws above recited the men of the country are divided into\r\nfour classes--the gentry, agriculturists, artisans, and merchants. The\r\ngentry are separated from the other classes by the distinctive badge of\r\nwearing a long sword, which they are warned never to forget. By this\r\nsword the class is distinguished over the whole empire. But the class\r\nis again subdivided by the respective badges, shields or coats-of-arms\r\nof the chiefs worn prominently on some part of the dress--generally on\r\nthe back and on each breast.\r\n\r\nThe right of wearing two swords brings with it privileges which may\r\nbe looked upon as means of paying the class--somewhat as purveyance\r\nunder the feudal laws of England conveyed privileges, which were gained\r\ngenerally at the expense of the agricultural class along the highroads.\r\nUnder these laws all two-sworded men are allowed to demand carriage\r\nfor themselves and goods along the highway at a much lower rate than\r\nothers, and this naturally ends in paying nothing. Their goods are\r\npermitted to enter towns free of customs, or at much-reduced rates.\r\nSuch privileges become in time very irksome to the class which has to\r\npay for them.\r\n\r\nWhile a Daimio is not permitted to add to his territories by purchase\r\nor marriage, these may be increased at the will and by the favor of the\r\nShiogoon, or they may be diminished by his fiat. While, if any officer\r\nhas been thought deserving of a little punishment, he may be desired to\r\nbuild a fort or a bridge, or make a road, or do something which shall\r\nbenefit the country, and at the same time act as a pecuniary fine upon\r\nthe person upon whom the honor is conferred.--The fort at Kanagawa was\r\nbuilt in this way.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest measures of control used by the Shiogoon toward\r\nthe barons is put forward when they have been known to be intriguing\r\nagainst their superiors. This is sometimes carried out without trial or\r\nprevious step of any kind, and consists in the intimation to the lord\r\nthat he is to divest himself of the insignia of rank, hand over the\r\npower which he holds as a Daimio to some other individual (generally\r\na near relative and a minor), and confine himself to one room until\r\nfurther orders. Such an intimation would probably not be given unless\r\nthe government were sure of its ground. But the power consists in\r\nthe position in which his own retainers stand toward their lord. If\r\nhe, upon receiving such a notice, obeys it at once, no other changes\r\ntake place; the individual is simply removed out of the way, and the\r\noffices are transferred to his successor. The wealthy and powerful\r\nvassals remain, with their property, unaffected by the step. But\r\nshould he presume to offer resistance, and rise in rebellion, all the\r\nretainers suffer with him. They will all be, in case of the failure of\r\nthe rebellion, deprived of their territories, which will be taken from\r\nthem and given to others. It is therefore the interest of all those\r\nabout a Daimio that he should obey a sentence which they all have an\r\nidea he more or less deserved. All those about him, therefore, insist\r\nupon his abdication; and he, feeling himself alone and forsaken, is\r\nobliged quietly to yield, and thus trouble to the whole province is\r\naverted. But in the case where the retainers believe that the cause of\r\ntheir master is a right one, and that he has the power as well as the\r\nability to defend himself, they will rally round him, and defy even\r\nthe highest government. This took place in the case of Choshiu against\r\nthe Shiogoon; while the cases of Satsuma, Owarri, and others, who were\r\ndeposed by the regent in 1858, show how the power is at times exercised.\r\n\r\nAs a further means of warding off intrigue and plotting among these\r\npowerful and wealthy barons, the plan was adopted by which all were\r\nbrought to the court of the Shiogoon, as inferiors or vassals, to pay\r\nhomage. The custom among these vassals of paying their respects once a\r\nyear had been long in use in an unsettled and desultory way at Miako,\r\nbut henceforth Iyeyas insisted upon each Daimio visiting his capital\r\nof Yedo at certain periods, fixed in proportion to the distance of his\r\nterritory. And he further insisted that his court should be looked\r\nupon as the natural residence of these lords, by their having their\r\nwives and families always resident in Yedo. And it was this law which\r\nrendered such stringent measures to be taken at Hakonay and other\r\ngates to prevent the passage outward of females. By this constant\r\nmoving of the Daimios to and fro between Yedo and the provinces, money\r\nwas circulated; large sums were spent in Yedo on the establishments\r\nthey kept up there, and large sums were spent on the way and at the\r\nresidence of each in his own province.\r\n\r\nIyeyas seems further to have been jealous of any intercourse being\r\ncarried on between these Daimios one with another, and in these laws\r\nmeasures are taken to prevent this as much as possible. The different\r\nclasses of Daimios met in different rooms in his castle, and one of one\r\nclass is not allowed to go into the meeting-room of another.\r\n\r\nAll these compulsory measures of vassalage in Yedo have tended to keep\r\nup in the Daimios a feeling of inferiority to the family in power, and\r\nare liable, when the influence of this family wanes, to become very\r\nirksome.\r\n\r\nThe general features of the country help with these aids to keep the\r\npower in the hands of one man or family. The number of islands, and the\r\nlength and narrowness of the island of Nippon, divided as it is by a\r\nmountainous ridge, prevent intercommunication being kept up or leagues\r\nbeing formed between contiguous proprietors.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of one set of officers at the court of Yedo to inform\r\neach Daimio when he is to come to the capital, and it is probably their\r\ncare to see that the owners of contiguous properties shall not be at\r\nthe same time at their respective country-seats.\r\n\r\nMany of these customs had been in use in the empire during the rule\r\nof those who had preceded Iyeyas; but he seems to have gathered what\r\nhe thought good, and strengthened what seemed weak, so as to provide\r\na firm basis on which to place his dynasty, and inclose it with\r\nsafeguards that should resist attacks from the restless and warlike men\r\nupon whose shoulders his seat had been raised.\r\n\r\nWith the wish natural to a great administrator, Iyeyas settled all\r\nthe offices about his court for the good government of the empire.\r\nThese are mentioned above; but as these offices require a more minute\r\nmention, they are given more in detail below. These rules run over\r\na large ground in their dealings with or allusions to all ranks and\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nExcept in the cases of high treason or open rebellion, the families\r\nof the feudal barons were not to be attainted. Primogeniture and male\r\nsuccession were encouraged as much as possible, and adoption of heirs\r\nsanctioned even during early youth, and sons so adopted can be returned.\r\n\r\nThe higher Daimios were not allowed to take office or to have any part\r\nin the government, except by giving their opinion when asked.\r\n\r\nThe Board or Parliament, where all officers on duty in Yedo met for\r\ndiscussion and consultation on general business (the Hio josho), was\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of crimes was modified, and the old cruel modes of death\r\ndone away with. Clemency toward enemies was urged as the proper method\r\nof gaining them over.\r\n\r\nRecreations for all men were allowed and approved of as useful both to\r\nbody and spirit.\r\n\r\nReverence toward the Emperor was inculcated by the example of the\r\nShiogoon, and by advice to the high officers about the court.\r\n\r\nThe high-priest at Yedo was to be appointed from a near relative of\r\nthe Emperor, in order that, if there should be a party siding with the\r\nEmperor, the Shiogoon might have a rival of the family in his own hands\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nThe exemption from civil and criminal jurisdiction claimed by the\r\npriesthood, and in which they were strongly backed up by the Roman\r\nCatholic priests, was abolished. A tendency to the idea that the\r\npriesthood, and priests as individuals, were hedged in by a divinity,\r\nwhich gave them a license for the committal and an immunity from the\r\npunishment of crimes, was pointed out as an evil to be guarded against.\r\n\r\nGentlemen having the right to wear two swords were to consider such an\r\nhonorable responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe empire was surveyed and good maps were made of every district.\r\n\r\nThe power of judging of what was insolence from an inferior to a\r\nsuperior, and the power of punishing it, were given, in a rather\r\nunguarded way, to individuals.\r\n\r\nMarriage was encouraged, and placed upon the footing of its being the\r\nway of heaven that one man should have one wife.\r\n\r\nThe reverence to be shown toward father, mother, elder brothers, and\r\nteachers is put forth upon the old Chinese views, and the relations of\r\nmaster and servant are in like manner treated of.\r\n\r\nThe military position of the country, the passes through the hills, and\r\ndangers, are all alluded to. The strategical positions about Yedo are\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nRoads come under regulation, and the building of farm-houses.\r\n\r\nThe government is considered as bound to do its best to provide cheap\r\nfood for the people. Mourning for the Emperor, religious sects,\r\nforeigners, prostitution, suicide--all come in for recognition in the\r\nBookay Hiak Kadjo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION AND COURT OF THE SHIOGOON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the above code Iyeyas laid down the order of rank in which the\r\nofficers about him or under him should move. The offices were probably\r\nmore or less settled and in existence during the rule of Taikosama and\r\nof Nobu nanga, and of the ministers who had filled a somewhat analogous\r\noffice during many generations at Kamakura.\r\n\r\nThe head of this Yedo system, as it may be called, is the Shiogoon, the\r\ncommander-in-chief or head of the military department of the empire,\r\nunder which is included the police and financial departments.\r\n\r\nFrom the account of the court of the Mikado, as given in a previous\r\nchapter, it is to be gathered that the Mikado is the chief ruler over\r\nthe empire. To him the whole empire looks up with reverence; from him\r\nflows the stream of honors conferred upon subjects--all equally his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nAfter the royal family (the Shinwo), the highest subject is the\r\nKwanbakku, who is at the head of the five highest families of Koongays.\r\nAfter these follow the other Koongay families in order, down to the\r\nlowest and poorest enrolled in the peerage of the empire.\r\n\r\nBeneath all this court, and standing upon a lower platform, is the\r\ncourt of the Shiogoon, at the head of which is the Shiogoon, the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army, and around him the Kami or Daimio\r\nclass, who receive and hold their territory from him as viceroy for\r\nthe Emperor. The words Shio goon were derived in early times from the\r\nChinese. Tsiang kiun is the title of the general commanding one of the\r\ndivisions of the army in China.--In ancient times in Japan the title of\r\nthe commander-in-chief was Mono nobe.\r\n\r\nThe past history of the empire has shown that the Emperor himself was\r\noriginally the leader or commander-in-chief of his own armies, but that\r\nin course of time the office was conferred upon one of the younger\r\nmembers of the imperial family. It was afterward transferred to the man\r\nwho in a lawless revolutionary period showed himself capable of seizing\r\nand holding the command of the army. Thus Yoritomo held it, and so it\r\nafterward became hereditary in the Ashikanga family, until the last of\r\nthese died out a few years before Iyeyas achieved the object of his\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nIn any consideration of the government of Japan and its relations, it\r\nis necessary to have clear ideas of the position in which the Emperor\r\nand the Shiogoon stand to one another. A reference to the history of\r\nthe country, as given above, may in some measure explain these; but it\r\nmay not be without use to state briefly what is the position of the\r\nShiogoon.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese generally are imbued with the idea that their land is a\r\nreal Shin koku, a Kami no kooni; that is, the land of spiritual beings\r\nor kingdom of spirits. They are led to think that the Emperor rules\r\nover all, and that among other subordinate powers he rules over the\r\nspirits of the country. He rules over men, and is to them the fountain\r\nof honor; and this is not confined to honors in this world, but is\r\nextended to the other, where they are advanced from rank to rank by\r\nthe orders of the Emperor. The doctrine of the divine right is carried\r\nperhaps further than it ever was in England, though, after all, he is\r\nprobably only regarded as “that sanctified person who, under God, is\r\nthe author of our true happiness.” He confers rank upon the officers\r\nof the empire, and from him Nobu nanga, Taikosama and Iyeyas received\r\nwhatever rank each held in the empire. By the death of the last of the\r\nAshikanga Shiogoons the opportunity presented itself of giving the\r\ntitle to one who had earned it, and it was given to Iyeyas.\r\n\r\nThe name by which the Shiogoon of the present day is known to\r\nforeigners is that of Tycoon; there is, however, no such title as\r\nTycoon in the language of Japan. The two words Tai kiun are Chinese,\r\nsignifying “the great prince, sovereign, or exalted ruler,” implying\r\nthat the bearer of the title is the great sovereign or ruler of Japan.\r\nSuch a title conveys an idea of superiority over all in the empire\r\nwhich is not conveyed by any of the native titles given to or assumed\r\nby the Shiogoon. The title is of foreign growth, and the assumption has\r\nbeen looked upon with great jealousy by the Mikado.\r\n\r\nBy the old Jesuit writers, the head of the executive was frequently\r\nspoken of as the Emperor, the Kubosama, the Xogune, etc. There was,\r\nindeed, in their case, some difficulty, as of the three Iyeyas alone\r\nwas Shiogoon, and that toward the end of his life. Kubosama, as has\r\nbeen stated elsewhere, was a title of respect given by the Emperor to\r\nthe first Ashikanga. It was given to him after he had given up the\r\ntitle of Shiogoon, and it is somewhat inconsistent to use them together.\r\n\r\nThe title used by the Mikado to the Shiogoon is Tai jiu, “the large\r\ntree”; and this is probably the best name that could be used by\r\nforeigners in speaking of him, or in addressing him officially. That\r\nused by the Daimios in addressing him is Rioo ay, or “the green tent.”\r\n\r\nThe son and heir of the Tai jiu, whether his father be alive or not,\r\ntill he is fifteen years of age, goes by the name of Takke cheoo, two\r\nChinese words meaning a bamboo shoot of a thousand years. He generally\r\nassumes the _toga virilis_ (the ceremony known as Gembuku) when he is\r\nabout fifteen; but if he is called to the succession as a child, this\r\nmay take place at an earlier period, or about eight or ten, when he\r\nhas his head shaved as a man and takes his man-name, by which he is\r\nthenceforth known.\r\n\r\nThere is a civil title which the present dynasty has been proud to\r\nassume as patrons of learning; namely, the head or rector of the two\r\nprincipal colleges of the empire, June wa and Shoongaku drio in no\r\nbettowo, implying that he is the principal patron or rector of the two\r\ncolleges of June wa and Shoongaku. This title is assumed as his being\r\nthe “Genji no choja”; _i.e._, the head of the Gen or Minnamoto family.\r\nHe may be spoken of as Minnamoto no choja--as such he considers himself\r\nas the first of all the military families of the empire. These titles\r\nhe assumes, and they may be called family and literary honors. So soon\r\nas he has passed the ceremony of Gembuku, the Emperor confers rank\r\nand title upon him; these are civil and military, and also of rank or\r\nposition. The lowest civil rank given to him is probably Dai nagoon,\r\nfrom which he is raised to Naidaijin, Oodaijin, and Sadaijin, and may\r\nbe raised to the highest, Daijodaijin; but this is generally reserved\r\nfor the Kwanbakku. The military rank given him is Shiogoon, to which\r\nthe prefix Dai, “great,” may or may not be added. The Dai Shiogoon is\r\nthe commander-in-chief of the army, and being, to a certain extent,\r\nlooked upon as hereditary, is only an honorary title. To this title\r\nis sometimes added the two words Se i (Ching i of the Chinese), the\r\nchastiser or tranquilizer of the barbarians or of foreigners; _i.e._,\r\noutside people at a distance from court. This title was originally\r\ngiven with reference to the conquest of the Ai nos in the north of\r\nJapan and Yezo; but it has lately been applied to foreigners by the\r\nMikado in his dispatches, as when he says, “I have given you the title\r\nof Se i; why do you not fulfill the expectations which I had of you?”\r\nSe i fhoo, the office of the pacifier of barbarians, is one of the\r\nnames applied to the castle of Yedo.\r\n\r\nOver and above these the Mikado denotes his place in the ranks of the\r\nnobility, as that he is of the second grade, first or second class.\r\n\r\nThe titles of Iyeyas were Jin itchi-i, first of the second\r\ngrade.--Oodaijin, the great minister of the right.--Se i dai Shiogoon,\r\ntranquilizer of foreigners and great commander-in-chief.--June wa,\r\nShoongaku drio in no bettowo, principal of the two colleges of June wa\r\nand Shoongaku.--Genji no choja, the head of the Gen clan.--Minnamoto no\r\nIyeyas.\r\n\r\nThe name of Daifusama, by which the Jesuits spoke of Iyeyas, is\r\na corruption of Naidaijin, as Nai foo sama, or, according to the\r\nsubsequent use of sama, lord of the inner office.\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon adopts a crest or coat-of-arms differing from that in use\r\nby the Mikado. It is called awui, or a representation of three leaves\r\nof a species of mallow, “awui,” joined at the points and inclosed\r\nin a circle. This is used in all official matters issuing from the\r\noffice. No one is allowed to use it but those who are relatives of the\r\nShiogoon, or upon business emanating from the office.\r\n\r\nIyeyas took up his residence at Yedo, in the castle which had been\r\nbuilt at a former period by Owota do kwang, and which was formerly\r\nknown by the name Tchi oda, and is at times still so called. Large sums\r\nof money were expended upon this residence. It was increased greatly\r\nin size. A deep trench or moat was dug round it, cutting it off from\r\ncommunication, except by the gates, with the town. This trench or moat\r\nwas and is kept filled by a canal drawn off from the Rokungo kawa, near\r\nthe village of Omaro, about nine miles from Yedo. At Miako the castle\r\nof Nijio Maro is his residence.\r\n\r\nAt Osaka, the large castle, formerly the temple of Hoonganji, and the\r\nresidence of Buddhist priesthood, afterward converted into a castle or\r\nfort by Taikosama, is in possession of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nAt Surunga, the castle formerly belonging to Imagawa is kept up at his\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIn Kahi, the castle of Kofu, formerly the property of Takeda, is\r\nanother residence, while in different provinces there are minor seats\r\nor residences occupied by retainers and officers.\r\n\r\nIyeyas was buried at Nikko san, where a magnificent temple was reared\r\nin his honor, to which repair at certain times his descendants and the\r\nofficers of the dynasty to pay reverence to his names, to commemorate\r\nhis greatness, or in the way of official duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DAIMIOS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the above laws Iyeyas speaks of Daimios and Shomios, among whom\r\nthe territories at his disposal were to be divided. The division was\r\nmade in the ratio of twenty millions to the Daimios to eight millions\r\nwhich he reserved to himself. “Daimio” is compounded of two Chinese\r\nwords, signifying “great name”; “Shomio” is “little name.” The latter\r\ntitle has fallen into disuse, and is generally replaced by Hattamoto,\r\nmeaning “the root or foundation of the flag.” The Daimio class may be\r\nconsidered to include every officer who holds directly of the Shiogoon,\r\nand has an official income from land held of the Shiogoon of the annual\r\nvalue of 10,000 koku of rice and upward. The real value of a koku is\r\ndifficult to ascertain, as it varies much at different times, whether\r\nit be looked upon as a measure of rice or as a coin--a kobang, as it\r\nis commonly reckoned. Of 4 kobangs assayed by the United States mint\r\nthe variation was from 3 dollars 57 cents to 5 dollars 95 cents, or\r\nfrom 15s. to 24s. 10,000 koku are considered equal to 25,000 piculs of\r\nrice, or nearly 4,000,000 pounds. There are many men whose incomes are\r\nupward of 10,000 koku, but who do not hold their land of the Shiogoon,\r\nbut of some Daimio. Such are not Daimios, but servants or retainers of\r\na Daimio, known sometimes as “By shing.”\r\n\r\nThe offices and officers of the court of the Shiogoon have continued,\r\nwith but little change, from the time of Iyeyas down to the opening\r\nof the country in 1858. The order in which these officers took rank\r\nwas settled by Iyeyas; but the offices seem to have been more or less\r\nin use during the time of his predecessor Taikosama, and had probably\r\nexisted for many years. Iyeyas in his laws did not for a moment\r\ncontemplate any interference with the court of the Emperor. That was\r\nabove him. The lowest Koongay of that court was above him until the\r\nEmperor should have conferred upon himself some title of rank.\r\n\r\nThe nobility of the Emperor’s court are all Koongay. Their names\r\nare enrolled in the Great Book of the Empire as enjoying patents of\r\nnobility, while the names of Daimios as such are not so enrolled. As\r\nDaimios they are not nobles of the empire. Daimios (literally Ta meng),\r\nor feudal lords (Chu haou), are, in contradistinction to Koongay,\r\ncalled Jee ngay (Ti hia). The former means “noble families,” the\r\nlatter meaning low, on a level with the earth. The Shiogoon himself\r\nis Jee ngay until he has been ennobled by the Emperor. Till recently,\r\nDaimios, except the few whose presence was required upon duty, were not\r\npermitted to visit Miako. Even when they received rank and title from\r\nthe Emperor, a relative was sent to pay homage.\r\n\r\nIyeyas, as head of the executive, dealt with these Daimios and\r\nHattamoto, or lesser barons, only. Among them there are recognised\r\nfour classes; viz., Koku shiu, Ka mong, To sama, and Fudai. The\r\nhighest class--Koku shiu (Kwoh chu)--“province lords,” were those\r\nwhose ancestors had been in possession of large territories, and\r\nwho in several cases opposed Iyeyas in arms, yet whom he thought it\r\nsafer to conciliate than to irritate, looking upon them as more on an\r\nequality with himself than the others. About the time of Iyeyas there\r\nwere seventeen of these province lords, to which number four have\r\nsince been added. The second class--Ka mong (Kia mun), family doors or\r\ngates--consisted of relatives of his family who had assisted him in his\r\nrise to power, and upon whom he conferred territory. If the “San kay,”\r\nor three families of his own line, be included, there were ten Ka mong.\r\nThe third class--To sama (Wai yang)--were those who, being no relatives\r\nor connections, were possessed of considerable landed property, and\r\nwho sided with Iyeyas during his struggle for power. The fourth--the\r\nFudai (P’u tai)--includes the officers, retainers, captains of his\r\narmy, or those who in civil capacities, but subordinate, assisted him.\r\nOf this Daimio class there are about 200. Fudai are the only Daimios\r\nwho are eligible for office, or who are allowed to take a part in\r\nofficial business. In rare cases To sama have given up their rank and\r\nprivileges in order to participate and take an active part in official\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe being a Daimio or Kooni kami implies that the officer belongs to\r\none of these four classes, and has an annual income from land, as has\r\nbeen said, of 10,000 koku of rice.\r\n\r\nThe standing of Daimios as a distinct nobility is not recognized at\r\nMiako, and it is therefore an object of ambition to them to obtain\r\nimperial honors at the hand of the Emperor, such honors being looked\r\nupon as much higher than the names by which they are known at the\r\ncourt of the Shiogoon, and which are conferred by him. These latter\r\nare invariably the name of a province, of which each is styled “kami.”\r\nThere are three provinces from which titles as kami are never taken by\r\nDaimios: Kadsusa, Fitatsi, and Kowotsuki; these provinces as a title\r\nbeing reserved for the relatives of the Emperor. This gives rise, as\r\nmentioned before, to the distinction between titles as Kooni kami and\r\nthose known as Kio kwang. These latter titles are much coveted, and a\r\ngreat deal of money is expended and interest employed in endeavoring to\r\nobtain a title from the Emperor. If an officer has both descriptions\r\nof titles, the Kio kwang always takes precedence, as in the case of\r\nSatsuma: he is a Koku shiu and a Kooni kami, as such he has the title\r\nof Ohosumi, or Satsuma no kami; but he is rarely so spoken of. Holding\r\nthe imperial title of Shuri no dai bu, he is known by this added to his\r\nfamily name, Shimadzu, Shuri no dai bu--_i.e._, Shimadzu, head of the\r\necclesiastical carpenters’ office. In addition to these designations\r\nfrom provinces by which Daimios are generally known, the Shiogoon has\r\nthought to confer higher honor upon some, and to attach them more to\r\nhis family and its interests, by giving them permission to use his\r\nfamily name. The name of the parent stock is Tokungawa, but the branch\r\nto which Iyeyas belonged was known as Matzdaira (a village in Mikawa).\r\nWhen the ruling officer is powerful, these lords are proud to use this\r\nname; when he is insignificant, they avoid it. Thus the lord of the\r\nwestern provinces of Nippon uses at times the family name of Mowori, at\r\nother times he is Matzdaira, Daizen no dai bu.\r\n\r\nThe higher class of the lords (the Koku shiu), who generally rule over\r\none or more provinces, are frequently called by the name of one of\r\nthe provinces as spoken according to the Chinese pronunciation of the\r\ncharacter. Thus Mowori is ruler over the province of Nagato; _i.e._,\r\nlong gate or entrance--in Chinese, Chang mun, Japanized into Cho mong.\r\nThe latter word is dropped, and instead of it “shiu,” or province, is\r\nadded--whence Cho shiu, the name by which he is frequently spoken of.\r\nSatsuma is thus Sas shiu, Owarri, Bishiu, etc.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty in completely understanding the use of the various\r\ntitles in Japan arises from a confusion in the application of the word\r\n“kami.” As a title, this word is conferred by the Emperor and the\r\nShiogoon. The word, when conferred by the Shiogoon, is the Chinese\r\ncharacter “shau,” with the meaning of keeper, or to take charge of.\r\nUsed in this way, the name of a province is invariably prefixed, as\r\nYamato no kami. And as the names of the provinces are known as our\r\ncounties are with us, the title is at once understood by a native.\r\nBut this is quite a different word from that found in the title of\r\nEe Kamong no kami. This is an imperial title. The Chinese character\r\nrepresenting this word is that of “tau,” or head, and implies that\r\nhe is the head of a department; viz., that which takes charge of the\r\nverandas and outside pathways about the palace. Again, the word occurs\r\nin military titles, as Sa yay mong no kami. In such a title the Chinese\r\ncharacter “tuh,” meaning to keep, to lead, or a general, is employed,\r\nimplying that he is commander of the guards of the left gate. In a\r\nfourth instance the Chinese character is “ching”--correct, to govern,\r\nor to see that things are correct; and the word is found in such titles\r\nas Oone me no kami, Oone me being the department of the female officers\r\nabout the palace. It is therefore evident that the office must be known\r\nbefore the title can be translated, and that the word prince will not\r\ngive a correct translation of “kami” when connected with such an office\r\nas Gengba, which is the office for foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nThe term “tono” is still frequently applied to Daimios by the common\r\npeople, and is often conjoined with “sama,” as Tonosama. It is the\r\nChinese word “tien,” a palace or hall, and was originally conferred\r\nupon the crown prince of China, and thence transferred to the son of\r\nthe Kwanbakku. The Portuguese writers frequently use “dono.” “Sama”\r\nis the Chinese “yang,” and was at first conferred upon Ashikanga\r\nyoshi haru when the Emperor for the first time gave him the title of\r\nKubosama. From this it passed as a title of respect to other high\r\nofficers, but has now become as common as esquire in England. “Tono” in\r\nthe same way is now used by Hattamoto. “Yakatta” (Ch., kwan), a word\r\nsometimes used by the Jesuits for Daimios, is properly restricted to\r\nthe castle of a Daimio, and is used only for the more or less fortified\r\nresidences of the more powerful of the class.\r\n\r\nThe five hereditary orders of peerage used in China are not known in\r\nJapan except by name (Ko, Ko, Haku, Shi, and Dan). Of the Daimio class\r\nthe Shiogoon is the head.\r\n\r\nOf the present dynasty, if such it can be called, Iyeyas was the first.\r\nHe derived his descent, in his officially published pedigree, from the\r\nEmperor Say wa, one of whose descendants was Iyo no kami, Yori yoshi.\r\nHis son was Hatchimang Taro, Mootz no kami, Yoshi Iyay. He was known\r\nin history as a great warrior, fighting in the province of Mootz for\r\ntwelve years. His third son was Siki bu no Ta yu, Yoshi kooni, the\r\nfounder of the families of Nitta and Ashikanga. His son was Nitta, Oee\r\nno ske, Yisho shigay, commonly called Dai ko een (great light). His\r\nfourth son was Yoshi Suyay, called Tokungawa shiro (_i.e._, fourth\r\nson), from whom was descended Minnamoto no Hirotada, the father of\r\nIyeyas, who was the eldest son. Iyeyas claimed to be descended from the\r\nNitta family. His grandfather was adopted by Matzdaira Tarozayaymon,\r\nthen a farmer in Mikawa, at the village Matzdira.\r\n\r\nI. Iyeyas had twelve children: 1. A daughter, married Okudaira\r\nMimasaka no kami. 2. A son, Nobu yas. His father suspected him of\r\nintriguing against him and was said to have killed him in Mikawa. In\r\none of Mr. Cocks’ letters he says, “It is said that the eldest son was\r\ndisinherited on account of his having lost his nose by disease.” 3.\r\nEtsizen chiu nangoong, Hideyas. As a boy he was given to Taikosama, and\r\nwas adopted by him. After Taiko had a son, he gave Hideyas in marriage\r\nto the heiress of the family of Yuki, in Kadsusa, an old family; and\r\nafter all the territory was overrun and despoiled, his father gave\r\nto him the province of Etsizen. 4. Hidetada ko married a daughter of\r\nTaiko, and succeeded his father as Shiogoon. 5. Tada yoshi ko, commonly\r\ncalled Matzdaira Satsuma no kami. He got Kioss, in Owarri, a place\r\nformerly belonging to Nobu nanga. 6. Nobu noshi. 7. A daughter, married\r\nto Hojo Sagami no kami. 8. A daughter, married first to Gamo Hida no\r\nkami and secondly to Assano Tajima no kami. 9. Etsigo, Kadsusa no\r\nske Tadateru. 10. Owarri, Hioyay no kami, Yoshi nawo, the founder of\r\nthe line of Owarri--one of the “three families.” 11. Kii, Dainagoon,\r\nHitatsi no ske, Yori yoshi, was first of the Kii or Kiisiu line--one\r\nof the “three families.” 12. Mito, Chiunagoon, Sayaymong no kami, Yori\r\nfhoossa, the first of the Mito line--one of the “three families.”\r\n\r\nII. Hidetada, appointed Shiogoon in 1605, married the daughter of\r\nTaikosama. He had nine children: 1. A daughter, married Hideyori,\r\nthe son of Taikosama. 2. A daughter, married Komatzu. 3. A daughter,\r\nmarried the son of Etsizen, the third son of Iyeyas. 4. A daughter,\r\nmarried Kiogoku. 5. A son, died in infancy. 6. Iyaymitz ko, the third\r\nShiogoon. 7. Tada naga. He intrigued to kill his brother Iyaymitz, and,\r\nbeing detected, was confined to his room for life. 8. A daughter, who\r\nmarried the Emperor Go midzuno. 9. Hoshima, Higo no kami, Massa yuki,\r\nfounder of the family now known as “Aidzu.”\r\n\r\nIII. Iyaymitz ko, appointed Shiogoon in 1623. He had five children,\r\nof whom: 1. A daughter, married Owarri. 2. Iyaytsuna ko, the fourth\r\nShiogoon of the dynasty. 3. Kofu, Sama no Kami, Szna Shigay.\r\n\r\nIV. Iyaytsuna ko, appointed Shiogoon in 1650. He was said to have been\r\nkilled by his wife, who was the daughter of a vegetable seller, and\r\nhad been employed as a servant about the palace. Her father was given\r\nthe wealth and rank of a Daimio, as Matzdaira Hoki no kami. The family\r\ncrest was (in reference to the father’s occupation), and is to this\r\nday, two Japanese turnips crossed. He left no family.\r\n\r\nV. Tsna yoshi ko, appointed 1680, was son of Kofu, Sama no Kami. He\r\nhad three children of whom: The second, a daughter, married Kii,\r\nTsunatoshi. 3. Iyay nobu ko, succeeded as Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nVI. Iyay nobu, appointed in 1710. He had three children: 1st and 2d\r\nwere sons, who died young. The youngest of the three was Iyay tsoongo\r\nko, who was the seventh Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nVII. Iyay tsoongo, 1713. He had no children, and was succeeded by a son\r\nof Kii Tsna toshi, who married the daughter of the fifth Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nVIII. Yoshi mone, 1716. During ten years of his youth a regent held\r\nthe reins. He is regarded as one of the most able of the successors of\r\nIyeyas. Is called, from his family, Kiishiu Kubosama. He abdicated in\r\n1745, and died in 1751. He had four children, of whom: 1. Iyay shigay\r\nwas the ninth Shiogoon. 2. Moone taka was the founder of the Go san kio\r\nfamily of Ta yass. 4. Moone kori kio. He is the first of the Go san kio\r\nfamily of Stotsbashi.\r\n\r\nIX. Iyay shigay ko, 1745. He had two sons: 1. Iyay haru ko, the tenth\r\nShiogoon. 2. Shigay yoshi kio. He is the first of the Go san kio family\r\nof Saymidzu.\r\n\r\nX. Iyay haru ko, 1762. He had six children, of whom: A daughter, died\r\nyoung. Another daughter married Owarri. Iyay motu ko, who was called\r\n“half Shiogoon.” It is generally believed that he was poisoned by his\r\nbrother Iyay nari. Iyay nari ko, who married a daughter of Satsuma. And\r\nthe sixth, a daughter, married Kii.\r\n\r\nXI. Iyay nari ko, 1787. He had fifty-one children; but as he was\r\nsubject to epileptic fits, and weakly in mind and body, he is not\r\ngenerally believed to have been the father of many of them. Of his\r\nchildren: The 2d, a daughter, married Owarri. The 3d was Iyay yoshi ko,\r\nthe twelfth Shiogoon of his line. The 11th, a daughter, married Mito.\r\nThe 13th, a son, became Kii, Dainagoong. His son, Iyay muschi ko, was\r\nShiogoon in 1858 to 1866. The 17th, Asahime, married Maizdaira, Etsizen\r\nno kami. The 26th, Ta yass, afterward became Daimio of Owarri. The\r\n28th, a daughter, married to Matzdaira, Hizen no kami (Nabeshima). The\r\n32d, a daughter, married to Kanga. The 34th, a son, Mikawa no kami,\r\nknown afterward as Kakudo sama. He was adopted by Matzdaira Etsigo no\r\nkami, and was considered a very able and judicious man, much respected.\r\nA party wished, in 1858, to make him Shiogoon, but he declined. He\r\nrepublished, for Japanese use, Kanghi’s “Dictionary of the Chinese\r\nLanguage.” The 39th, a daughter, married to Matzdaira, Aki no kami. The\r\n41st, a daughter, married Sakai, Oota no kami. The 42d, a daughter,\r\nmarried Tokungawa, Mimboo kio. The 43d, a son, adopted by Owarri. The\r\n45th, a son, adopted by Kiishiu, and afterward became Kii, Dainagoong.\r\nThe 46th, a son, adopted by Etsizen no kami. The 47th, a son, adopted\r\nby Awa no kami. The 49th, Okura no tayu, adopted by Yamato no kami.\r\nThe 50th, Hiogo no tayu, adopted by Sahio yay no kami. The other\r\nthirty-four children died in infancy or childhood.\r\n\r\nXII. Iyay yoshi ko, 1837. He had twenty-five children, of whom: The\r\nfirst six died in infancy. The 7th, Iyay sada ko, succeeded him. The\r\n9th, Tokungawa, Mimboo kio, was adopted by Stotsbashi, one of the Go\r\nsan kio, and he himself afterward adopted a son of Mito, which son was,\r\nuntil his abdication in 1867, the last Shiogoon of the dynasty. The\r\n21st, a daughter, married Arima, Naka tskasa no tayu. The 25th married\r\nMito. The rest all died in infancy.\r\n\r\nXIII. Iyay sada ko, appointed in 1853. He had no sons.\r\n\r\nXIV. Iyay mutchi ko, 1858, formerly Haru taka, son of Kii, thirteenth\r\nchild of the eleventh Shiogoon, succeeded to the office. The death\r\nof Iyay sada without an heir was the origin of much intrigue and\r\ntrouble in the empire during the year 1858. There were two claimants\r\nto the succession; the one was the son of Mito, who had been adopted\r\nby Tokungawa, Mimboo kio, the ninth son of the twelfth Shiogoon; the\r\nother was the eldest surviving son of the eleventh Shiogoon, who had\r\nbeen adopted by Kiishiu. It became, therefore, a struggle between the\r\ntwo houses of Mito and Kiishiu, and the regent sided with the latter.\r\nIt was a question between a son adopted out of the line and a youth\r\nwho had been adopted into the line. Iyay mutchi died in 1867, and was\r\nsucceeded by Stotsbashi as Yoshi hissa, who in his turn abdicated in\r\n1868, and so the dynasty of Tokungawa terminated.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that the offices about the court of Yedo were\r\nall settled by Iyeyas. In his testamentary rules he laid down the rank\r\nand order in which they were to stand in the court. These may be here\r\nmore particularly described.\r\n\r\nIn the family of the Shiogoon, as given above, mention is made of the\r\nSan kay and of the San kio. The former name means the three families,\r\nthe latter the three princes of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe “three families” referred to are the descendants of the three\r\nyoungest sons of Iyeyas--to the one of whom was given the lordship of\r\nOwarri, to the other that of Kii, and to the third that of Mito, a town\r\nand district in the province of Hitatsi. The heirs of these nobles\r\nstand at the top of the list of Daimios, and from out of these families\r\nis chosen, in case of vacancy, a successor to fill the seat of Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nThe San kio (three princes of the blood) were sons of the eighth and\r\nninth Shiogoons, and having in view the possible extinction of the\r\ndirect line of Iyeyas at the time, these young men and their families\r\nseem to have been set apart, in imitation of the Sin we, or imperial\r\nfamilies at Miako. They were assigned residences within the palace\r\n_enceinte_ at Yedo, but take no regular part in public business. They\r\nare paid a yearly income by the Shiogoon, each having a separate little\r\ncourt. The three princes are respectively called Ta yass, Stotsbashi,\r\nand Say midzu. The last, the house of Say midzu, is, so to speak, at\r\npresent extinct and the residence unoccupied, and though it is in the\r\npower of the Shiogoon to reappoint a member of his family, it is not\r\nlikely soon to be filled up. The Go San kio are not styled Daimios.\r\n\r\nThe Go tai ro, or Regent.--In a hereditary jurisdiction, such as that\r\nof the Shiogoon, provision must be made for the contingency of the\r\nyouth or incapacity of the heir upon his succession. Under this name,\r\nwhich means the great or illustrious elder, a regency--an office\r\nsimilar to that of the Sessio at Miako--is provided. It is an office\r\nwhich is only filled when necessity calls for such an appointment; and\r\nthere are only certain men eligible for the office. He must be a Fudai\r\nDaimio, and, if possible, one of the four known as the Si Ten wo. These\r\nare Eeyee or Ee, Sakakibarra, Sakkai, and Honda. Of these the first, Ee\r\nKamong no kami, is called the Do dai, or foundation-stone of the power\r\nof the dynasty; the ancestor of the family, Ee nawo massa, having been\r\nlieutenant-general and right-hand man to Iyeyas.\r\n\r\nSo long as things go smoothly, and the wheels of government revolve,\r\nsuch rules may be carried out; but when any country begins to ferment,\r\nthe ablest or the least scrupulous man comes to the surface. Previous\r\nto the accession of the thirteenth Shiogoon, Iyay sada, Ee had\r\ngradually crept into a position of power (to which he may have been\r\nmore or less entitled) through the mental infirmity of the reigning\r\nShiogoon. He assumed or was voted into the office of regent. Intrigues\r\nwere rife in Yedo and Miako, and in consequence of his leaning toward\r\nforeigners, or for other reasons, he was assassinated.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the custom that the Fudai and Kamong Daimios\r\nsettled who was to be regent without any reference to the Emperor;\r\nbut since the opening up of the country the Emperor has risen in\r\nimportance, and at present he or his officers settle who is to be the\r\nhighest officer when necessary. A common or vulgar name for the Gotairo\r\nis Koken, or Oshiru me--_i.e._, looker back or behind. They have seldom\r\nheld office long, and have too often come to an untimely end.\r\n\r\nThe Go ro chiu, or Toshi yori (the senior central officers, or the\r\n“Cabinet,” as they may be called), consists generally of four or five\r\nFudai Daimios appointed to the office by the Shiogoon. All Fudai\r\naspire to the office, but the members are in quiet times chosen from\r\nthe thirteen families mentioned in the laws of Iyeyas as head Fudai.\r\nAmong the members of the Cabinet one is generally looked upon as Prime\r\nMinister; but they all take duty in monthly rotation. It is considered\r\na great honor to have been ten years in office, and the Shiogoon in\r\nsuch a case raises the territorial income of such officer. This is\r\nthe most responsible office, and too often in times past has entailed\r\nupon its possessor the mistaken duty of retrieving an error by the\r\ncowardly retreat of suicide. They are responsible for the whole acts of\r\ngovernment, which are supposed either to have originated with them or\r\nto have been carried out with their cognizance. The Go ro chiu meets\r\ndaily at 10 A.M. in the Go yo shta be ya, a room in the palace. They\r\npreside in the Hio jo sho, or deliberative assembly of acting officers,\r\nwhen the Shiogoon is not present. But it is natural to suppose that\r\nwhen great international questions come before the country, as the\r\nopening up of trade with foreigners, the larger Daimios and Koku\r\nshiu should have a voice, and should take a share in changes of such\r\nmagnitude. Consequently of late the Go ro chiu has been rather set\r\naside as things move toward Miako, where before long the power and\r\nresponsibility will fall to the corresponding office at the imperial\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have a saying, that a wealthy man should have little power\r\nin the state, but that comparatively poor men should have the power.\r\nThis seems to be one of their principles of government.\r\n\r\nSoba yo min is an office which is only occasionally filled, as when the\r\nShiogoon is young. He seems to be an officer of communication between\r\nthe Go ro chiu and the other departments. This is the highest office\r\nfilled by Hattamoto.\r\n\r\nWaka toshi yori--literally, the younger elders or senators. They are\r\ngenerally five in number, a second Cabinet, or Under-Secretaries of\r\nState. They are Fudai Daimios, or Hattamoto. They are frequently\r\npromoted to vacancies in the Go ro chiu.\r\n\r\nSosha are generally Fudai, in number about thirty. Their duty seems to\r\nbe attending to officers arriving at the palace. It is an office of\r\nlittle power and considerable expense. They rise in ordinary times to\r\nbe Jee sha, temple lords, and other officers of authority.\r\n\r\nThe Kokay, or Kowokay, can hardly be called officers of state. The\r\nname means high families (Ch., Kau kia), and includes the male\r\nrepresentative lines of some of the families of distinction in ancient\r\ntimes, such as Nobu nanga, Ashikango, Yoritomo, Arima, etc. It seems\r\na matter of policy to keep them under the eye of the court, giving\r\neach an allowance from the state of territory from 500 to 1,000 koku\r\nper annum. They are looked upon as men of high rank but little power,\r\nbeing neither Daimios nor Koongays, but between the two. They are\r\noccasionally employed to act as proxies for the Shiogoon in state\r\nvisits to the temples of Nikko or Isse, and have attempted of late to\r\nassert their right to act as embassadors to foreign countries. There\r\nare about eighteen Kowokay at present.\r\n\r\nO Tsu may shiu are Fudai Daimios who act as guards to the apartments\r\nof the Shiogoon. From the room in which they meet in the palace they\r\nare spoken of as Gan no ma Daimios.--The room being painted with\r\nrepresentations of wild geese.\r\n\r\nJee sha (Ch., Sz shie) boonio, temple governors. These are described by\r\nKæmpfer as “imperial commissioners, inspectors, protectors and judges\r\nof all the temples and the monks belonging thereunto. This employment\r\nis, after the Emperor’s Council of State (_i.e._, the Go ro chiu), one\r\nof the best in the empire, and the persons invested with it are very\r\nmuch considered at court. They hold their court at Yedo. All civil\r\naffairs relating to the clergy--such as lawsuits, disputes arising\r\nabout the limits or revenues of their lands, prosecutions for wrongs\r\nor damages received, and the like--are brought daily in great number\r\nto be decided in this court. Again, all criminal cases--as rebellion,\r\ndisregard of the imperial proclamations and commands, and in general\r\nall capital crimes committed by the ecclesiastics--are tried before\r\nthem, and, in case of conviction, punished with death, though these\r\ncriminals are much more indulged than other people and cannot be\r\nexecuted without the consent of and a warrant signed by the general at\r\nMiako. Another branch of the business of these Dsisia Bugjo is to take\r\ncare of the maintenance of the clergy, to keep the temples in repair,\r\nand otherwise, in all cases where the secular power and authority is\r\nwanted, to assist them.”\r\n\r\nEvery Japanese is registered (or is supposed to be registered) in some\r\ntemple, and whenever he removes his residence, the Nanushi, or head man\r\nof the temple, gives a certificate. The books of each temple are sent\r\nto Yedo, to the office of the Jee sha, where they are copied. These\r\nofficers act as judges in disputes between priests of one temple with\r\nthose of another; between Daimios in disputes about boundaries; between\r\nSamurai and Hattamoto, but not between merchants or farmers. The prison\r\nunder their charge is better kept and under milder restrictions than\r\nother prisons. They have under them numerous Do sin, or runners of a\r\nhigher class, to seize criminals. As they have to keep up the prisons\r\nunder their charge, the office is looked upon as one of expenditure and\r\nnot of profit. The numerous interests with graduated degrees of ruling\r\npower in Japan render great tact necessary in disputes between these\r\ninterests. The monasteries and priesthood are still very powerful, the\r\nDaimios become jealous of interference, and the interests of those\r\nholding of the Shiogoon, as well as of those holding land of the\r\nEmperor in the Go ki nai, must be considered; so that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary, not only that distinct laws should be laid down, but also\r\nthat it should be established who are to be the judges between rival\r\nclaimants.\r\n\r\nOne temple lord sits on the bench in the Hio jo sho every month in\r\nrotation, and he is thence spoken of as Tski ban.\r\n\r\nO Russui are Hattamoto officers, but rank as Daimios, who have charge\r\nof the apartments of the Shiogoon, and of the women of the palace when\r\nhe is absent. They are all old men. All young persons entering or\r\nleaving the private quarter of the palace are examined as to sex. In\r\nthe office there is a female examiner. These officers give passes to\r\nfemales on visits of business or ceremony. There are generally eight\r\nofficers, who have each under them ten Yoriki and fifty Do sin. The\r\nincome of each is 15,000 koku.\r\n\r\nOwo ban kashira.--These are the captains of the great guards of the\r\ncastle of Yedo. There are twelve, seven Daimios and five Hattamoto.\r\nTheir duties are entirely military. Under these twelve are one hundred\r\nOwo ban, who are all Hattamoto.\r\n\r\nSho eeng ban kashira is also a military office, apparently the\r\nbodyguard of the Shiogoon. There are ten commanding officers.\r\n\r\nOkosho ban kashira.--These seem to be lords-in-waiting upon the\r\nShiogoon, of whom there are ten. They are Hattamoto, each having thirty\r\nmen under him.\r\n\r\nOwo metsuki--literally, great or senior attached eye.--Of these there\r\nare five head men. Beneath these are the Metsuki, and an inferior body\r\nof men called Katchi metsuki.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important department of the government of Japan. The\r\ntitle is frequently translated “spy,” and the duties seem in some cases\r\nto corroborate this view. But the idea of espionage by no means conveys\r\nan accurate understanding of the subjects under the care or control of\r\nthese officers.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objects of the superintendence of this department\r\nis the eight roads of Japan, and the regulations of the laws of these\r\nroads. Another is the manners and customs of officers in reference\r\nto state dress, their intended marriages, going and coming to Yedo,\r\nand visiting elsewhere; death and mourning of officers; receiving\r\nreports sent in by the branches of the office in the provinces as to\r\nthe military equipment of Daimios, the uniforms, devices, flags, which\r\nthey use; in regard to religion, and especially the Roman Catholic; as\r\nto the Yakunins, or inferior officers of the Shiogoon’s government,\r\ntheir number and duties, and the census of Japan. Such are some of the\r\ndifferent kinds of business which come before this office.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the roads are regulated in a separate branch of the office,\r\nunder the Do chiu boonio. The book of laws or orders is the Do chiu\r\nboonio kokoroee, and, in its present form, seems to have been published\r\nabout 1840.\r\n\r\nThere were formerly five highways, afterward two were added, and by\r\nthe addition of the road to the temple of Nikko, there are now eight.\r\nThe office issues rules for Daimios and Hattamoto passing along these\r\nroads, and for merchants and farmers when traveling. In every village\r\nor town along the road these rules are affixed in the To iya or\r\ngovernment office, for all the villages upon these highroads are to a\r\ncertain extent under the control of the government, even when the road\r\npasses through the territories of Daimios. The following are headings\r\nof these regulations:\r\n\r\nAs to providing two-sworded men with lodgings on the road, and cangos\r\nor chairs to travel in.\r\n\r\nAs to children traveling, two in one cango, or mother and child.\r\n\r\nAs to members of the Gorochiu when traveling.\r\n\r\nAs to different customs, if such officer be traveling on private or\r\npublic account.\r\n\r\nAs to giving a passport to a traveler (Saki buray); as to where he is\r\nto sleep, and at what hotels he is to stop on the road.\r\n\r\nAs to traveling during the night, if it be necessary.\r\n\r\nRules as to sleeping at towns.\r\n\r\nRules as to (tcha tatte onna) servant-women, and other descriptions of\r\nwomen, in inns.\r\n\r\nTo keep accounts in each town of the number of coolies and horses used\r\non the road each day.\r\n\r\nAs to Buddhist priests when traveling on the road.\r\n\r\nAs to affixing in six public places in Yedo the (Kosatsu) laws of roads.\r\n\r\nAs to the rates for carrying goods.\r\n\r\nAs to the officers who examine the weights of goods.\r\n\r\nLaws as to the porters on the road.\r\n\r\nRules as to going into and leaving hotels on the road.\r\n\r\nRules as to government goods carried upon the roads.\r\n\r\nAs to officers who travel at government expense--as the Tenso,\r\nEmperor’s messengers, etc.\r\n\r\nAs to how many porters each Daimio is entitled to, and the rate of\r\npayment. If he wants more, he must pay at a higher rate.\r\n\r\nIf one of his servants travels by himself, he is not to be provided for.\r\n\r\nRules as to tenants of government lands when they come to Yedo.\r\n\r\nRules as to the dress and payment of meshi mori onna--that is,\r\nservant-women who occasionally act in both capacities--in inns.--By\r\nlaw two women only are allowed in each inn, but more are kept, and\r\nfines paid for keeping them. The strictness and minute care with\r\nwhich the Japanese government watches over its people is shown in the\r\nregulations laid down for public women, known as Joro. This name is\r\nonly applied to those who are kept in government establishments in the\r\nlarger towns, as Yedo, Osaka, Miako, Nagasaki, where a place in the\r\ntown is set apart for their residence. The laws for the regulation of\r\nmorals are very different in different parts of the empire. In the\r\nterritories of some Daimios, as Tosa and Kanga, public prostitutes\r\nare not permitted, indecent songs are interdicted, and the inns and\r\nbathing-houses regulated; but the government of the Shiogoon considers\r\nthese things to be necessary evils, and takes them under its own\r\ncharge. The finest women in Japan are said to be in Etsizen and\r\nIdzumo, where they are famed for the fineness of their complexions and\r\nsmoothness of skin, with higher noses and little or no smallpox. It is\r\nsaid that men cannot leave Neegata, where the public women are called\r\nHak piak ya gokay, or 808 widows. This name arose after one of the\r\ndesolating battles in old times, in which that number of husbands was\r\nslain and the widows obliged to seek for wherewithal to live. In one\r\nnight in 1860 the officers in Yokohama seized 108 young women who were\r\nsuspected of leading immoral lives without a license from government.\r\nThe most beautiful public women of Yedo annually take a prominent part\r\nin the processions, or matsuri, and their portraits are sold and hung\r\nup about the large temples and places of resort.\r\n\r\nLaws as to thieves and robbers on the highway.\r\n\r\nAs to fires breaking out in villages on the road.\r\n\r\nAs to the duties of Daimios on such occasions.\r\n\r\nAs to rivers, and crossing them. Crossing rivers is often very\r\ndangerous, and the porters are made responsible for knowing where the\r\npath of safety lies, and when it is unsafe to attempt passage.\r\n\r\nAs to giving public notice at a hotel before a Daimio arrives.\r\n\r\nAs to harai kata (sweeping and cleaning the road before a Daimio\r\narrives).\r\n\r\nAs to things lost on the road.\r\n\r\nWhen a Daimio’s servants are lodged in a separate inn from their master.\r\n\r\nIf a man become insane upon the road.\r\n\r\nAs to fighting among gentlemen’s servants.\r\n\r\nAs to deaths by killing in such quarrels.\r\n\r\nAs to Daimios falling sick on the road.\r\n\r\nAs to Daimios returning to Yedo on account of sickness.\r\n\r\nAs to rivers when impassable from high floods, what Daimios are to do.\r\n\r\nAs to obstructions from unexpected convulsions of nature, such as an\r\nearthquake, flood, etc.\r\n\r\nAs to servants of Daimios who have died upon the road.\r\n\r\nAs to behavior of Daimios when meeting the Tenso or Koongays upon the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nAs to the rates for carrying Daimios’ luggage.\r\n\r\nAs to occasionally examining goods contained in boxes.\r\n\r\nAs to government packages having the go shu een, or red seal, upon them.\r\n\r\nAs to government packages passing through Yedo.\r\n\r\nAs to the porters of Yedo.\r\n\r\nAs to persons wishing to travel very quickly.\r\n\r\nAs to Owo ban kashira, captains of the guard of Yedo, when traveling.\r\n\r\nAs to porters who have become sick, or who may have run away.\r\n\r\nWhen sometimes a passport has not been previously given on the road,\r\nthe Daimio to give to the keeper of the government inn his seal and a\r\npaper to this effect.\r\n\r\nSome officers travel free on the road, and their expenses become a tax\r\nupon the people living in villages along the road, and who are supposed\r\nto benefit by the travelers. Of such are Daimios coming to pay respects\r\nto a new Shiogoon upon his accession. In 1861 the Ooyay no mia, or\r\nHigh-priest of Yedo, traveled with 250 followers. He was about nineteen\r\nyears of age. The walls of the inns at which he stopped were newly\r\npapered, and new clean mats put on the floors. For this the villages\r\npaid, he paying one boo--_i.e._, 1s. 6d.; and on leaving, his servants\r\ntore the paper off and cut the mats, that they might not be used again.\r\n\r\nAs to the Shoshidai, or envoy of the Shiogoon, when traveling.\r\n\r\nAs to the governors of the castles of Osaka, Soonpu, or Miako, or the\r\nguards of these castles. Governors of places held of the Shiogoon, but\r\nat great distances from Yedo, as Nagasaki and Hakodadi.\r\n\r\nAs to Koongays and such high officers when traveling.\r\n\r\nAs to Ray kayshi, or messengers sent annually to Nikko by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nAs to carriage of ingredients for making gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThe Daikwangs, who look after the government farms and woods. All of\r\ntheir men and goods are carried along the public roads at the expense\r\nof the villages.\r\n\r\nBy this office the ceremonial due to high officers upon the road is\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nIf a Daimio in his norimono meet a high Koongay--one of the Sekkay or\r\nMonzekke--his porters must not walk on, but must stop till the high\r\nofficer has passed, but he need not get out.\r\n\r\nThe same respect is to be paid to the otchatsubo, or jars containing\r\nthe tea for the use of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nA Byshing--_i.e._, one of the higher retinue of a Daimio--must leave\r\nhis norimono and kneel down, taking off his hat.\r\n\r\nThe same respect is to be shown by these Daimios and Byshings to\r\nanything bearing the red seal of the Shiogoon, to the great guards\r\nbringing up muskets, to the governors of the castles at Miako, Soonpu,\r\nand Osaka, and to the Shoshidai.\r\n\r\nWhen a Daimio meets the Tenso, his norimono is to be carried slowly,\r\nand on one side of the road.\r\n\r\nA Byshing must kneel and take off his hat.\r\n\r\nPorters can be obtained from 4 A.M. to 8 P.M., but not at any later\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nKoongay and Monzekke are to be provided at the public expense with\r\n35 horses and 50 porters. If they require more, they must defray the\r\nexpense themselves.\r\n\r\nThe “three families,” and higher Daimios and Emperor’s messengers, are\r\nallowed 100 horses and 100 porters; lower Daimios, 50 horses and men.\r\nSome Daimios are not allowed to travel on the tokaido.\r\n\r\nIt is enjoined that members of the Gorochiu, the envoy and governors of\r\nOsaka castle, when they meet a Daimio upon the highway, ought to speak\r\nto him; but if they do not wish to speak, they may say that they are\r\nnot well.\r\n\r\nIf they meet in the same hotel at night, the Daimio is to ask them if\r\nthe Shiogoon requires his assistance in any way.\r\n\r\nWhen they meet on the road, the Daimio must open the door of his\r\nnorimono and act as if he were going to get out, but the other must\r\nrequest him not to do so.\r\n\r\nOtchatsubo, or jars containing tea for the use of the Shiogoon, are\r\ntreated with great respect. If a captain of a guard meets these jars\r\ncarried by porters, he makes his bearers go to one side, and his\r\nfollowers kneel and take off their hats. The porters call out as they\r\ngo along the roads, and all the common people kneel down. This custom\r\nwas begun by Iyeyas. Recently there have been slights and insults\r\noffered to these jars, to show personal feeling on the part of some of\r\nthose opposed to the present state of things, as Satsuma.\r\n\r\nByshing entitled to carry a spear, upon meeting a member of the\r\nGorochiu, or the Shoshidai, or tea-jars, etc., must wait till such\r\ndignitary is past. Byshing not entitled to a spear are under the same\r\ncustoms as common people.\r\n\r\nTwo-sworded men singly meeting the tea-jars, Gorochiu, etc., stop and\r\ntake off the hat only, but do not kneel down.\r\n\r\nAll common people must kneel down and take off their hats to Koongays,\r\nShoshidai, Gorochiu, Oban kashira; and, though there be no law for it,\r\na Daimio often takes it into his own hands and punishes or kills a man\r\nor woman who does not kneel down while he is passing. Such was the case\r\nwith Shimadzu Saburo and Mr. Richardson in 1862; but Shimadzu was not\r\neven a Daimio, but the father of the young Daimio. On one occasion a\r\nByshing of Kiogoku, Nagato no kami, killed a man of Matzdaira, Sanuki\r\nno kami, for turning aside upon the road and making water while his\r\nnorimono was passing; while another ordered a woman to be cut down for\r\nstanding and looking at him.\r\n\r\nA Daimio with an income of 200,000 koku, with 20 horsemen and 120\r\nfootmen in his retinue, is allowed 300 porters. One of 100,000 koku,\r\nwith 10 horsemen and 80 footmen, is allowed 150 porters. One with\r\n50,000 koku, with 7 horsemen and 60 footmen, is allowed 100 porters;\r\nand so downward in proportion.\r\n\r\nWhen a Daimio meets a Gomiodai, or envoy from the Shiogoon, he is to\r\ngive him half the road, and to stop his norimono while the envoy is\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nThe same respect is to be shown to envoys from the Emperor (Chokoo\r\nshi), the royal family, the Tenso, and other high officers.\r\n\r\nIn the case where one Daimio has taken possession of an inn on\r\nthe road, and another comes from an opposite direction and wishes\r\naccommodation, this is sometimes the cause of serious fighting.\r\n\r\nIf a Byshing be in the retinue of his superior lord, and a government\r\nofficial with the red seal be met, he must not get out of his norimono\r\nor off his horse; but if alone, he must do so.\r\n\r\nIf a Daimio meet an imperial envoy (Chokoo shi) or Eenshi, or a member\r\nof the royal family, a relative of the Emperor, or a high Koongay, he\r\nmay, if he wishes, turn off the road up a by-road till the great man\r\nshall have passed, to save himself from getting out of his norimono and\r\nkneeling down, or, if he be riding on horseback, from dismounting.\r\n\r\nTo lower Koongays the Daimio must give half the road.\r\n\r\nIf a Byshing or Hattamoto is on government business with the red seal,\r\nhe is to be treated as a Daimio.\r\n\r\nTo one of the “three families” a Daimio is to get out of his norimono\r\nand propose to kneel, but is to be requested not to do so. As a general\r\nrule, to men of the third rank and above, Daimios must kneel; to men of\r\nthe fourth rank and below, no ceremonial is required.\r\n\r\nThese headings may give some idea of what the duties of the road\r\ndepartment of the Owo metski office are.\r\n\r\nIt is further the duty of the office to see that the roads and bridges\r\nare kept in repair.\r\n\r\nFrom these rules it is evident that great exactness must be insisted\r\nupon in traveling along the highroads as to the days when officers\r\nare to leave each place, and the houses at which they are to stop, in\r\norder that there may be no confusion in official arrangements, and to\r\navoid unpleasant collisions which might happen on the road. The office\r\nmust even at times take into consideration the private feelings of\r\nindividuals. At one time the young Eeyee Kamong no kami was coming up\r\nto Yedo with a large retinue, and Shimadzu Saburo of Satsuma was going\r\ndown to Miako. In two days they were to meet on the tokaido, when the\r\nwhole country expected to see a fight, for which both parties were\r\nprepared. But the office, hearing of it, sent peremptory orders to\r\nEeyee to go round by another road.\r\n\r\nThe Owo metski office must be consulted previous to the betrothal\r\nor marriage of a Daimio or his eldest son, and also previous to the\r\nadoption of a son by a Daimio. Marriages and adoptions are generally\r\nmade in their own class, and frequently among relatives; but some of\r\nthe Daimios are married to the daughters of the highest Koongays.\r\n\r\nThe members of this office appear to act as reporters in all government\r\nmeetings. Indeed, whenever two or three persons meet together in\r\nJapan, there seems to be some member of this silently observant office\r\npresent. Reports of everything that goes on throughout the empire are\r\nsent into this office for the information of government, and these\r\nreports are recorded for reference. Men acting nominally as horseboys\r\nand servants in the foreign consulates have been emissaries from this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nBy law every innkeeper is obliged to keep a book (Yado cho), in which\r\nevery traveler is noted down, and what he may do or say that may be\r\nthought worth reporting. Similar books (Gio koo cho) are kept in public\r\nbrothels, in which are noted the names of men frequenting them (if the\r\nnames can be got), or marks upon their bodies; how much money they\r\nspend, the saki they drink, etc. These are all for the use of this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe prevention of the spread of the Roman Catholic or Jashiu mong sect\r\nis one of the cares of the Dai Kwang department of the Owo metski\r\noffice. The names, with the genealogy, of all the families among\r\nwhich there were known to be Roman Catholic converts are carefully\r\nkept. Boards, called Christang hatto kaki, on which are printed a\r\nprohibition of the Christian religion, are put up in every large\r\ntemple. Individuals belonging to the families under observation are\r\nnot allowed to move their place of residence without permission of\r\nthis office. If one dies, intimation must be given to the office, when\r\nan officer is sent to view the body, and all the relatives sign a\r\ncertificate. Or if at a distance, it must be preserved in salt. The Dai\r\nKwang office superintended the Yay boomi, or trampling on the cross,\r\nonce a year at Nagasaki. It is the duty of the office to examine for\r\nChristians all over the western provinces once in three years. Whenever\r\na child is born in a family formerly Christian, notice must be given to\r\nthe office. Marriages must be reported; and also the intended adoption\r\nof a son. Adopted sons are sometimes thrown back again by the adopting\r\nparents, but Christians are not allowed to do this. A register for the\r\nsame purpose is kept by the governor of Miako. These forms are kept up\r\nto the great-grandchildren of the original Roman Catholics, but have\r\nof late fallen into desuetude; but it may hereafter prove the means\r\nof stirring up dying embers of faith among the descendants in the\r\nrecollections of their ancestors. The members of this department, while\r\nsitting with others, report, but have neither a voice nor a vote.\r\n\r\nMatchi boonio.--The street governors, or, as they may be called,\r\ngovernors or mayors of Yedo. (The Shiogoon himself is considered\r\ngovernor of Yedo, and Mito is hereditary Fuko Shiogoon or\r\nVice-Shiogoon, and ought as such to reside constantly in Yedo.) Of\r\nthese there are two; the one over the east, the other over the west\r\npart. The authority of these officers is chiefly over the mercantile\r\nclass. They have little or no power over the Samurai, or two-sworded\r\ngentry. Their duties are with the streets and police of Yedo. They\r\nsit as judges alternately, and take cognizance of all questions and\r\nquarrels among the mercantile class. Upon a Daimio coming to stay at\r\nYedo each alternate year, he is to call on and pay his respects to the\r\nGorochiu, Wakatoshiyori, Owo metski, and Matchi boonio, before he goes\r\nto his own house.\r\n\r\nGo Kanjo boonio may be called the head of the exchequer. These are two\r\nofficers who keep the accounts of the empire; they also act as judges\r\nin all cases between persons of the agricultural class. They have great\r\npower. Of the Do chiu boonio, or governors of the roads, one is always\r\nKanjo boonio, and one is Owo metski. The mint and coinage of money\r\ncome under this department. Under them they have five men as seconds\r\nor assistants, Kanjo gim maku, besides two men who upon alternate days\r\nkeep the accounts of the expenses in the Shiogoon’s palace.\r\n\r\nSakushi boonio are two Hattamoto officers, superintendents of the\r\ncarpenters of the Shiogoon, and under them are four men, Daiko kashira.\r\nAs mentioned before, the trade of a carpenter is looked upon in Japan\r\nas a very honorable occupation.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are Shta boonio and Fusim boonio, who superintend\r\nthe carpenters of the offices and women’s apartments, the wells in the\r\ncastle, providing tables, boxes, mats, etc.\r\n\r\nGoong Kan.--The naval department has two governors--Goong Kan boonio.\r\nThese may be called Lords of the Admiralty, but until recently the\r\noffice was one of comparatively minor consideration. There were\r\nfour naval instructors under these governors who had picked up some\r\nlittle knowledge from the Dutch and from Dutch works on naval affairs.\r\nLatterly, the office has become one of much greater importance. Great\r\nattention is being paid to naval matters and to steam, and the office\r\nhas consequently been remodeled. The government has invested largely\r\nin steam-vessels, and has erected steam works for making and repairing\r\nall sorts of machinery, and is making every attempt to obtain a\r\nwell-educated set of men, who shall be thoroughly instructed in all\r\nthe branches requisite for naval officers. At Nagasaki the Japanese\r\ngovernment has one large set of works, and another in the vicinity of\r\nYedo. A dry-dock has been excavated for the cleaning and repair of\r\nthe vessels of government. Until lately the Japanese government seems\r\nto have paid no attention to keeping any vessels of war. Fast-rowing\r\nboats were kept near Nagasaki, and one at Uraga, in the bay of Yedo,\r\nand at other stations ordinary boats were kept. These, however, were\r\ngenerally noted for speed rather than strength, and rarely put to sea,\r\nbut watched vessels coming to land and overhauled them on the part of\r\nthe custom house.\r\n\r\nKo bo shin shi hai.--This seems to be an office for young unemployed\r\nHattamoto officers, where records are kept of what each excels in, for\r\nthe information of government.\r\n\r\nShin ban kashira.--School for teaching young officers about the court\r\nriding, rifle-shooting, etc.\r\n\r\nOkosho is a general name for officers waiting on the person of the\r\nShiogoon.\r\n\r\nNaka oku go ban shiu.--Some of the private guards of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nHoko nando.--Men who look after the dresses and clothes of the\r\nShiogoon; and others are in the flag office or the spear office.\r\n\r\nHiaku nin Kumi no kashira.--These are guards. They were originally\r\nYamabooshi priests, called Negoro and Nengoro, or, as the translator\r\nof the letters writes it, Negroes, in the large monastery of Kumano,\r\nin the province of Kii; and after their buildings were burned down by\r\nTaikosama, and their lands confiscated, they joined the army in a body,\r\nand Iyeyas attached them to himself as guards.\r\n\r\nThere are departments for superintending the manufacture of bows and\r\narrows, and muskets, rifles and cannon.\r\n\r\nAnother office has the charge of balls, shells, powder, etc.; and\r\nanother has the charge of the armory, containing bows and arrows,\r\nrifles and coats of mail.\r\n\r\nHon maro russui ban.--The Hon maro is the name of that part of the\r\ncastle or shiro of Yedo occupied by the Shiogoon. Six officers keep it\r\nwhen he leaves it temporarily.\r\n\r\nNi no maro russui ban.--Keepers of the part assigned to the son or\r\nconcubines of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nHikeshi.--These are fire brigades in the service of the Shiogoon in\r\nYedo, of which there are twelve, one to a district; each under the\r\ncharge of a Daimio.\r\n\r\nThese guard against fires in the castle, the government godowns in the\r\ntown, and the large temples where the tombs of the Shiogoons are. Each\r\nbrigade has a leader, who holds on the end of a long pole a mattoyay,\r\nor white solid device, easily seen at night. The duty of this leader\r\nseems to be to stand as near the fire, and as long as he possibly\r\ncan; and in fulfilling this duty they appear to rival the fabulous\r\nsalamander. Each brigade has overcoats with distinguishing marks,\r\nand masks the better to stand the heat. However, in wooden buildings\r\ntheir organization seems of little use. The fires generally wear out\r\nof themselves, the inhabitants carrying off their money, clothes, mats\r\nand windows to places of safety. There are other fire-engines and fire\r\nbrigades in Yedo under the Matchi boonio. The town is divided into\r\nforty-eight districts, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet I,\r\nRo, Ha, and to each district there is a brigade. If a fire breaks out\r\nin the Ro district, all the men of the Ro brigade go to it. The rest of\r\nthe town unburned pays each man of the brigade employed four tempos, or\r\nabout 6d., after the fire.\r\n\r\nDaimios keep men of their own as firemen, generally men in some small\r\ndisgrace, whose names have been erased from the town books or dismissed\r\nfrom employment.\r\n\r\nAt one time fires occurred so frequently in Yedo that a notification\r\nwas issued that the proprietor of the first house in which a fire\r\nshould thereafter originate should be transported to the islands. The\r\nfirst offender was Mito. It would not do to transport him, so he fell\r\nupon the plan of borrowing, through the priesthood, on payment of a\r\nlarge sum, 30,000 days from eternity, beyond which time he had little\r\nprospect of living. This has frequently since been found to be an\r\ningenious plan for men of wealth escaping punishments.\r\n\r\nMetski are lower officers of the Owo metski department, and seem to act\r\nas judges in civil cases. There are fourteen Metski.\r\n\r\nTskybang are messengers, attendants in war or during fires to the\r\nShiogoon.\r\n\r\nTaka jo.--Keepers of the Shiogoon’s hawks.\r\n\r\nKatchi ngashira.--The officer who superintends the men lining the\r\nstreets when the Shiogoon goes out--a ceremony, however, which has been\r\ndone away with.\r\n\r\nJiu ri si ho--meaning “ten miles in four directions.”--Men whose\r\nduty it is to take care that no one shoots within ten ri--_i.e._,\r\ntwenty-five miles--of the castle. Even within this distance there\r\nare places in which native sportsmen are allowed to shoot, for which\r\npermission is given upon application. An infraction of this law was\r\nthe reason given for the seizure of an Englishman in 1859--one of the\r\n_causes célèbres_ in the early history of Great Britain’s relations\r\nwith Japan. This is a sub-branch of the Owo metski office.\r\n\r\nShiu mong aratame is the branch of the same office which examines into\r\nthe religion of individuals, especially with the object of restraining\r\nthe spread of Christianity.\r\n\r\nDo chiu boonio is the officer who has charge of the highroads, bridges,\r\netc., under the Owo metski.\r\n\r\nTo zoku (Tau tsih--catch thief) Hi tske is the same as Kai\r\nyaku--_i.e._, reforming officers. This is, in its subordinate offices,\r\na very wide department--aiming at thorough espionage, secrecy in\r\ndetection, and surveillance, as well as overpowering strength in\r\ncarrying out the wishes of government. The whole of society in Japan is\r\npermeated by officers of this department. All public places are full\r\nof them. Inns are kept by them; they reside as priests in temples, or\r\nwherever the general public resorts. The keepers of these inns and\r\nfarmers in the country are frequently in the employ of the police.\r\nThere is a saying in Japan, “Dorobo oi zen”--implying that it is\r\nbetter to put money on a thief’s back than to apply to the police. The\r\npolice runners have means at the stations for constantly strengthening\r\nthemselves by gymnastic exercises, and are taught to tie up criminals\r\nin a variety of ways, from so lightly as to lie like a net, to so\r\ntightly that before long the victim is strangled. They are always\r\nprovided with a short iron baton, with which, in case of resistance,\r\nthey strike their man over the head to stun him.\r\n\r\nKo boo shio boonio.--The military school where drill exercise, the\r\nuse of weapons of war, fortification and military tactics generally,\r\nare taught to young officers. There are three officers over the\r\nestablishment, but many teachers of the different branches. The school\r\nis in Owo ngawa matchi or street in Yedo. Artillery is taught near the\r\ngarden of the Shiogoon at Hama go teng. Sword-practice with sticks\r\n(kenjits) is a favorite amusement with young officers. They have sticks\r\nwith basket guards, with which they practice. Before beginning, each\r\nputs on an iron wire grating over the head, a bamboo-and-leather belt\r\naround the chest, and bamboo guards for the arms with gloves. Yet\r\nwith all this one is sometimes severely handled. The sword is long,\r\ntwo-handed, sharp on one edge and at the point, and for about two\r\ninches from the point on the back; so that they either cut or thrust,\r\nand aim at cutting the neck with a back cut. They are very dexterous at\r\nthe use of this weapon, whether against a sword or a bayonet or spear.\r\nPractice with the rifle is also very common in the government schools,\r\nand in the grounds of Daimios about Yedo. There is a large parade\r\nground or open country to the back of Yedo for the use of the military,\r\ncalled Hiro.\r\n\r\nNaka kawa bansho.--An office for the examination of boats coming\r\nfrom and passing to the interior by the communicating branch of the\r\nriver--the Naka gawa. Upon this stream boats can go to the provinces on\r\nthe northwest, north and east of Yedo. Besides these there are officers\r\nwho have charge of the Shiogoon’s barges and boats.\r\n\r\nThere are officials whose duty is to examine into alleged encroachments\r\nby Daimios in Yedo upon the roads, streets, rivers, or sea. The\r\nsuperficial quantity of land as gardens that an officer may hold in\r\nYedo is regulated by his official income. (One tsubo equals thirty-six\r\nsquare feet.) An income of from 300 to 900 koku may have 500 tsubo,\r\n18,000 square feet; 1,000 to 1,900 koku may have 700 tsubo, 25,200\r\nsquare feet; 2,900 koku may have 1,000 tsubo, 36,000 square feet; 4,000\r\nkoku may have 1,500 tsubo, 54,000 square feet. And so on up to 150,000,\r\nwhose allotment is 7,000 tsubo, or about 252,000 feet square.\r\n\r\nThere are sword-keepers of the Shiogoon, and also keepers of the books\r\nor library, and a keeper of the presents, gifts, or tribute paid\r\nby each Daimio. Gifts as tribute are being received daily, and are\r\nregulated by order. But frequently handsome presents are voluntarily\r\nmade by Daimios, perhaps in some cases for favors to come. For\r\ninstance, Owarri is ordered to present to the Shiogoon upon the first\r\nmonth, third day, congratulatory cakes.\r\n\r\nUpon the third and seventh months a large noshi--symbol of a present\r\nwith a piece of dried fish--with paper and two tubs of wine.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of the fourth month, fish; and again in the same month,\r\nA-ï, a fresh-water fish, considered a delicacy.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth and eighth months, the same fish preserved in vinegar.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth month, the first day, ice. It is a custom in Japan to use\r\nice upon that day.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth and seventh months, muskmelon.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, in summer, anything he thinks may please.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of the ninth month, one obang (a large gold coin,\r\nworth above £6) or more.\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth and tenth months, persimmons--the best come from Mino.\r\n\r\nDuring the eleventh month, tea, cakes, fish, saki and Owarri radishes,\r\nwhich are very large and fine.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelfth month, fish, persimmons, storks, which are supposed\r\nto be a royal bird, and only for the table of the Shiogoon; but many\r\npeople eat them.\r\n\r\nA present from an inferior to a superior, as from a Daimio to the\r\nShiogoon, is “Kenjio”; the reverse is “Hyrio.” The Shiogoon is said to\r\nhave called in proclamation the steamer “Emperor,” presented to him by\r\nher majesty the Queen of England, “Kenjio.”\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon has also four secretaries for private business, and others\r\nfor government business.\r\n\r\nThere are professors or teachers of the works and writings of\r\nConfucius. There is a school or college for the study of foreign books;\r\nbut the school was lately entirely remodeled, and greater encouragement\r\ngiven to the study of foreign languages, books, and arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nThere is an observatory, with astronomers, compilers of the almanac,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNineteen physicians attend upon the Shiogoon, five of whom practice\r\nafter the European system, and fourteen after the Chinese. There\r\nare five surgeons, of whom one practices according to the European\r\nsystem, and medical officers for treatment by acupuncture--_i.e._, by\r\ninsertion of fine needles. These are fine flexible wires, not so strong\r\nas those used in imitation of them in Europe, but requiring a tube to\r\nbe used for their insertion to prevent the needles bending. There are\r\nalso dentists and oculists and medical men for attending officers on\r\nduty at the castle, and others for attending officers who are outside\r\nthe castle. There is one medical man for vaccination, together with\r\nconsulting physicians; and also doctors to look after the sick poor and\r\ndestitute. There is or was a public hospital at Koishikawa.\r\n\r\nThere is an officer who may be called poet-laureate.\r\n\r\nThere are musicians to the court, and teachers of the Sinto religion;\r\nalso teachers of a game, a kind of chess, as well as chess itself.\r\n\r\nAfter these are the keepers of the wicket-gate by which females go out\r\nor come in, and men to look out from a lofty platform. Such are always\r\nraised in Diamio’s houses, to enable the watchmen to look down upon the\r\nsurrounding streets by day, and to look out for fires by night.\r\n\r\nThere are keepers of the jewels belonging to the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nThere is one officer who looks after the food for the Shiogoon,\r\nand keeps the accounts of the expenditure of the table, as well as\r\ninspectors of rice for the use of the Shiogoon himself.\r\n\r\nThe head-cook superintends the kitchen, and there are also cooks for\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nHama goteng boonio.--The governor of the Hama goteng, a garden on the\r\nseaside beneath the castle in Yedo. This is a large piece of ground\r\ncut off by a canal, and formerly kept as a private garden for the\r\nrecreation of the Shiogoon on the seaside. It is one of the places\r\noffered to the foreign ministers for residences in Yedo, and refused\r\nby them upon, possibly, good grounds. It has since that time been\r\nconverted into a ground for artillery practice. There were three head\r\ngardeners.\r\n\r\nThere are men to look after the garden for medicinal herbs, and\r\nofficers who have charge of the curtains used for concealment or\r\nprivacy. These “macu” have been sometimes thought by foreigners to be\r\nintended to represent forts; but they are constantly used in Japan by\r\npleasure parties and others wishing to be in the open air, and yet to\r\nenjoy a little privacy; and it is considered rude to look over the\r\nedge of one at the party inclosed. They may be used also in war to\r\nconceal the numbers of a host. The “mong,” or crest of the owner, is\r\ngenerally stamped upon the curtain, which has at a distance, perhaps,\r\ngiven the idea of loopholes.\r\n\r\nKane boonio.--Four officers who pay out and receive payments on account\r\nof the Shiogoon. Payments are made on the 6th, 14th and 26th days of\r\nthe month. Money is received on the 1st, 10th, 18th and 24th.\r\n\r\nThere is an office for the exchange of notes or orders for officers.\r\nBanks and Daimios issue paper money, called tayngata, and also gin\r\nsats (silver card), kin satz (golden card). They are much used by the\r\nmerchants in Osaka in business transactions.\r\n\r\nKoora boonio.--Officers in charge of the rice storehouses belonging to\r\ngovernment. These storehouses of rice are very large, as a great part\r\nof the pay of officers is given in rice. It is considered degrading\r\nto speak of paying money in salary. Even presents of money among the\r\nlower classes are always wrapped up in red paper neatly folded. A man\r\nis hired as servant for so much rice, known as footchi--_i.e._, rice\r\ngiven on hire; footchi is always given in addition to money, and it is\r\nproper to speak of footchi, not of money-hire. In Taikosama’s time one\r\nfootchi was 10 ngo of rice; now it is only 5 ngo, or about 2 pounds.\r\nIn speaking of a man’s income, if pioh (or piculs) are mentioned, rice\r\nis meant; but if koku, ground to the valued extent of production.\r\nRetainers are paid 30 piculs a year, and half a sho (1½ pounds of rice)\r\nper diem. In government payments the rice is measured in boxes, not\r\nweighed. The Chinese picul is equal to 133 pounds, but the Japanese\r\nwas generally larger, and ranged from about 150 to 160 pounds. The\r\nkoku, therefore, would be 450 to 500 pounds. According to Williams, it\r\ncontains 5.13 bushels.\r\n\r\nThere are officers in charge of the oil and lacquer, and others over\r\nthe working carpenters and masons. Others are over the government\r\nforests and trees, for superintending planting, cutting, etc. Special\r\nofficers have charge of the Shiogoon’s pleasure barges on the river. A\r\ntax or license is imposed upon all boats plying on the river at Yedo,\r\ncollected by another officer.\r\n\r\nTattame boonio.--Officer to look after the mats about the palace. The\r\nwhole floor of the rooms of the palace is exactly covered by mats, each\r\nsix feet long by three broad. These mats are two inches in thickness,\r\nand are made of straw tightly tied together by string. This is covered\r\nby a woven web of fine, long, strong, dried grass from the sea-coast.\r\nIn the houses of all classes in Japan these mats are used, but in\r\nthose of the wealthier classes they are very beautifully made, soft\r\nand pleasant to walk on for persons wearing stockings only, as is\r\nthe custom. The reception room in the palace is called the Hall of a\r\nThousand Mats. If there be such a room it would be 150 feet long by 120\r\nwide; but as the partition walls in Japanese houses are, between many\r\nof the apartments, only light sliding screens, movable at pleasure, it\r\nmay be easy to throw open a very large room in an extensive building\r\nsuch as the palace is.\r\n\r\nThere is a jeweler to the court, and auditors of accounts, who are also\r\nassayers or examiners of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThere are teachers of riding to the Shiogoon, and veterinary surgeons\r\nand horsebreakers.\r\n\r\nKatchi me tski.--A low class of spies. These are kept secretly by\r\ngovernment, and are employed in nominal employments, in houses, shops,\r\nor wherever information is likely to be obtained. They are frequently\r\ngrooms, as in this capacity they accompany their masters wherever they\r\ngo. They write down whatever they hear or see that is suspicious:\r\nthe thin paper partitions of the rooms give facility for this, as\r\nthey have only to put the tongue against the paper and then push the\r\nfinger through, when a hole sufficiently large is made, through which\r\nboth to see and hear. If these men allow themselves to be detected\r\nby Samurais, or officers, no mercy is shown to them. If they have,\r\nas is generally the case, a sort of written commission, and this is\r\nfound upon them, they are put to death and the paper is sent to the\r\ngovernment. No notice is afterward taken of such a deed. It is looked\r\nupon as a dangerous profession, and they know the risk, but they are\r\ngenerally well paid. Daimios use them also. Mito had a man in 1862\r\nin the employ of Ikeda, then governor of Yedo. He watched his master\r\nintriguing against his lord, and assassinated him. An officer was long\r\nin the employ of the British consulate at Yokohama who was in constant\r\ncommunication with the government.\r\n\r\nThere are officers, keepers of the stairs of the castle, and others who\r\nlook after the fires and fireplaces.\r\n\r\nBowozu are young men who act as servants to guests or officers residing\r\nin the castle. It is not permitted to Daimios to bring their servants\r\ninto the palace. They are waited on by the Bowozu. These men are said\r\nto be open to giving up to any one copies of any or all documents\r\npassing through the government offices on payment of a small sum--30 to\r\n50 itzaboos per annum.\r\n\r\nOfficers are appointed for keeping the time by striking a large drum,\r\nand there are men who give signals by blowing a shell, such as is used\r\ngenerally for directing movements in warlike operations.\r\n\r\nYoshiba boonio.--Yoshiba is the name of a penal establishment on the\r\nisland of Tsukudajima, at the mouth of the Yedo River, to which certain\r\ncriminals are sent, to prepare oil and charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe above list comprises all the officers engaged in the service of the\r\nShiogoon, and who may be considered government officials conducting the\r\nbusiness of their departments in offices in Yedo. But as the office\r\nof Shiogoon is in abeyance it remains to be seen in what manner the\r\ngovernment is to be hereafter carried on; and whether the court of\r\nMiako, which is now temporarily removed to Yedo, will return to the\r\nolder titles and offices as known at Miako, or will adopt the forms and\r\noffices which have been in use at the court of the Shiogoon in Yedo.\r\n\r\nThe Hio jo shio--The Board of Deliberation.--This is a large place\r\nof meeting for deliberation in Yedo, outside of the palace-moat, and\r\nclose to the residences of the Gorochiu. On fixed days of every month\r\ncertain officers sit here for the discharge of their duties. These\r\nseem to be to receive complaints against officers, and to decide cases\r\nbrought before them for judgment. Upon other fixed days, all Daimios or\r\nHattamoto upon duty in Yedo seem to have the right, or are called upon\r\nas a duty, to meet for the discussion of political matters laid before\r\nthem. Hio jo means to deliberate or hold a consultation; and at these\r\ntimes the Gorochiu, Wakadoshi yori, Owo me tski, and other officers,\r\nmeet here for deliberation upon affairs affecting the government.\r\n\r\nWithin the palace Daimios meet in rooms according to their rank, and\r\nthe class of Daimios is often spoken of by the name of the room in\r\nthe palace in which it meets--as the Obee no ma, the Tomari no ma,\r\nthe Yanangi no ma, the Gan no ma, the Kiri no ma, the Tay kan no ma,\r\nthe Fuyo no ma, or the Goyobeya, or the Siro jo in (or Kuro jo in),\r\nin which last all classes seem on occasions to meet. But it is only\r\nin rare cases that all are called together; such an occasion was the\r\nproposal brought before them by Commodore Perry to overturn the old\r\nlaws and throw open the country. It has been seen that Iyeyas in\r\nhis laws thought the meeting of this assembly, the Hio jo sho, very\r\nimportant, and he said that the president must be a man of the clearest\r\nintellect and best disposition, and that once in every month it should\r\nbe the duty of the Shiogoon to go to the assembly without previous\r\nintimation, and there act as judge.\r\n\r\nImmediately in front of the building stands a box, known as the Mayassu\r\nhako. Into this box any one may put a paper of complaint upon any\r\nsubject which he wishes to bring before the assembly. These papers,\r\n“Mayassu,” are taken out and examined, and those which are signed are\r\ndiscussed, those which have no signature are burned. There are similar\r\nboxes at Miako and Osaka.\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as a sketch, or very imperfect translation,\r\nof the matters which come under the cognizance of the assembly as\r\ninstructions to officers:\r\n\r\n1. When a complaint is made with reference to ground in a street in\r\nfront of, and generally belonging to, a temple, and which is frequently\r\nlet as shops, etc.; or in reference to Go rio, ground belonging to the\r\nShiogoon; or Shi rio, ground belonging to Daimios--these complaints are\r\nnot to be taken up by the board, but are to be referred to the Tskiban\r\n(the temple lord who is sitting for the month).\r\n\r\n2. All quarrels and complaints between and against Yedo street people,\r\ncitizens of Yedo, are to be referred to the governor of Yedo.\r\n\r\n3. In the Kwang hasshiu, or eight provinces immediately around\r\nYedo--Awa, Kadsusa, Simosa, Hitatse, Simotsuki, Kowotsuki, Segami and\r\nMusasi--disputes between the tenants of the Shiogoon and those of\r\nDaimios or Dai kangs are to be referred to the treasury governor. These\r\nthree governors are known as the “San boonio.”\r\n\r\n4. Proceedings as to disputes between Daimios as to ground.\r\n\r\n5. Between brothers as to succession to the father’s property.\r\n\r\n6. In the case of a demand for a new trial after a decision has been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n7. In regard to petitions from friends to let a prisoner out of\r\nconfinement on the ground of his innocence, must have good reasons\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n8. If the people want an alteration or change of a law.\r\n\r\n9. What is to be done with papers, Hakko so, put into the box.\r\n\r\n10. If people complain of officers.\r\n\r\n11. In a complaint of an improper judgment in a case (perhaps in\r\nanother court).\r\n\r\n12. Business in the Hio jo shio. The 2d, 11th and 21st days of the\r\nmonth are “Siki jits,” or days when public political business is\r\ndiscussed. The 4th, 13th and 25th, “Tatchi yeibi,” the officers meet as\r\njudges to decide cases. On the 6th, 18th and 27th, “Uchi yori yeibi,”\r\nsecret meeting days, the officers meet to examine and discuss secret\r\npolitical matters among themselves.\r\n\r\n13. The form to be followed when a case has been for a long time\r\nbefore the Hio jo shio and is referred to another judge, as the street\r\ngovernor; and what is to be done in reference to complaints against the\r\nGorochiu, Wakatoshiyori, or Owometski.\r\n\r\n14. Complaints against Yakunins, or officers on duty outside of Yedo,\r\nare to be referred to the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\n15. Disputes as to water for irrigation, and embankments of rice\r\nfields, which are sources of frequent quarrels, are to be taken up by\r\nthe Hio jo shio.\r\n\r\n16. In disputes as to boundaries of property, the old titles in the\r\nhands of the disputants are to be examined, and compared with the\r\n“Midzu cho” (water book, or register), kept in the Daikang office for\r\nthe registration of boundaries and property.\r\n\r\n17. In disputes as to land, to apply to the proper office to have\r\nsurveys made.\r\n\r\n18. What is to be done in cases of forgery of title-deeds of lands, or\r\nof maps of villages, islands, etc., which is a common offense.\r\n\r\n19. As to disputes between Kanushi, heads of temples and of government\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n20. In cases where application is made by the friends of a criminal to\r\nhave him pardoned, such is not to be entertained in cases of arson,\r\ntheft, murder, either as principal or accomplice, striker of father or\r\nmother or master, gamblers, head men of villages convicted of extorting\r\nmoney, mikassa (literally three hats),[7] and men who have bought young\r\ngirls secretly. These crimes are not to be pardoned.\r\n\r\n21. As to arbitrations ordered by officers, only a certain number of\r\ndays to be allowed to make such arbitration--the office to settle how\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n22. When a petition has been presented by one party and the other does\r\nnot appear, what is to be the proceeding.\r\n\r\n23. Accusations of theft and fire-raising are not to be brought before\r\nthe Hio jo shio, but before the officer in whose jurisdiction the\r\noffense is committed.\r\n\r\n24. In cases of discovery of a long antecedently committed murder.\r\n\r\n25. If a man destroys a summons issued by the office, and refuses to\r\nobey it.\r\n\r\n26. Cases of persons trying to pass the barriers at Hakonay and Arai,\r\nwithout the knowledge of the officers stationed at the barriers.\r\n\r\n27. In a case of firing a pistol or gun at another without killing, the\r\npunishment is “chiu tsui ho”--_i.e._, the culprit is not allowed to\r\nenter a town or village. If a man wishes to shoot or sport near Yedo,\r\nhe must get a license from the Yakunins to do so within the ten ri\r\nbetween Hatch ogee and Kanagawa upon the Tama River. Native sportsmen\r\nfrequently shoot.\r\n\r\n28. How persons are to be dealt with for snaring birds, or _feræ\r\nnaturæ_, on the hunting-lands of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\n29. In towns, if a man have committed a small offense, the Yakunins may\r\norder his door to be shut upon him, and him to be confined in his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n30. Cases of embezzlement of money by village head men.\r\n\r\n31. Punishment for a man who has failed to enroll his name in the\r\nofficial register.\r\n\r\n32. If a man offer a bribe to an officer he is to be severely\r\npunished; the officer, if he accepts it, is lightly dealt with.\r\n\r\n33. All the property of a person, convicted of theft or robbery is to\r\nbe confiscated.\r\n\r\n34. If the people on a Daimio’s territory send a remonstrance against\r\nhis oppression to the Hio jo shio, what is to be done with it.\r\n\r\n35. All the goods belonging to a debtor may be sold to pay his debts,\r\nexcept his wearing apparel.\r\n\r\n36. If persons try to bring wild ground into cultivation, and call it\r\ntheir own without informing the officers, what proceedings are to be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n37. Cases of litigation as to rented ground.\r\n\r\n38. When persons are unable, from poverty, to pay government taxes upon\r\nground occupied by them.\r\n\r\n39. In regard to loans of money, of which twenty different kinds are\r\nalluded to--to a friend, to a temple, etc.\r\n\r\n40. If the whole of a loan cannot be repaid, and it is referred to\r\nthe officers, they are to settle the interest to be paid. Upon large\r\namounts the interest is placed low, upon small amounts it is high. Upon\r\n10,000 kobangs the rate will be 80 kobangs per month, or nearly 10 per\r\ncent per annum. Upon one boo it may be one tenpo a month, or 75 per\r\ncent per annum.\r\n\r\n41. In borrowing money, the interest is to vary with the security.\r\nIf the security is land, the interest is to be low; with any other\r\nsecurities the interest should be high.\r\n\r\n42. In disputes as to money: If no witnesses are brought forward; if\r\npartners in business quarrel; if persons in theaters quarrel; if a\r\ncollector uses subscriptions to temples for his own purposes; if the\r\nevidence depends upon a paper without a date; if no rate of interest is\r\nmentioned--then these cases are not to be taken up.\r\n\r\n43. If it is alleged that a Daimio has borrowed money from some town or\r\nbody of people, and they do not bring forward a receipt, such is to be\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n44. If one creditor refuses to have a composition.\r\n\r\n45. The officers may settle the time to be allowed to pay off a debt,\r\nafter which the securities may be taken. For 1,000 kobangs, 12 months\r\nto be allowed; for 30 kobangs, 40 days.\r\n\r\n46. When property already mortgaged is given in security.\r\n\r\n47. In cases where the cargo of a ship is secretly sold upon her\r\npassage, and a story of bad weather is told.\r\n\r\n48. When a father has sealed a draft of his intended will, and has not\r\nwritten it out, what is the position of the heirs.\r\n\r\n49. When false witnesses are suborned.\r\n\r\n50. Houses or ground are sometimes sold by relatives when the heir is\r\nyoung. It is therefore criminal to buy ground without giving intimation\r\nto the proper officer.\r\n\r\n51. It is the custom to have guarantees for servants, to whom wages are\r\ngenerally paid in advance. If the servant runs away with his wages, his\r\nsurety must pay for him.\r\n\r\n52. Half-yearly engagements with servants at the third and ninth month\r\nare usual. If a servant runs away before his time is out, his surety is\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n53. If it is another servant that is surety, he is responsible.\r\n\r\n54. When a Daimio’s servant runs away, what is to be done.\r\n\r\n55. It is usual to have ten sureties--how this is to be settled. Not\r\nmore than ten to be allowed.\r\n\r\n56. If a runaway servant steals from his master.\r\n\r\n57. If a man stays away from his wife for ten months she may marry\r\nagain. When he returns he is to be punished.\r\n\r\n58. If a poor man secretly marries and has a child, and exposes it on\r\nthe street, or if another man buys it and exposes it, either shall be\r\nspeared or beheaded. The head man of the street is to be fined and\r\ndeported from Yedo, and the Gonin gumi or police guard of the street\r\nare to be punished.\r\n\r\nThe head man of a village or block of streets is Nanushi; under him is\r\nIyaynushi. The Go nin gumi are five police in every street, who are\r\nappointed and paid by the streets. Nanushi often have much power and\r\nbecome wealthy. Iyeyas in his laws tried to prevent this, as it is in\r\ntoo many cases the result of oppression and bribery. In Yedo and Osaka\r\nthe government appoints the Nanushi; in Miako the people appoint them.\r\nThe Nanushi of a village is generally a hereditary office.\r\n\r\n59. If a man shall have adopted a daughter and then sells her to the\r\ngovernment stews (Yosiwara), he is to be punished. The punishment is to\r\nvary according to the wealth and the ability of the offender to support\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\n60. If any one secretly sells girls for prostitution to any one but the\r\nYosiwara, he is liable to punishment.\r\n\r\n61. If a man sells his wife to the Yosiwara without reason, he is to be\r\nbeheaded. But if the wife agrees to be so sold, and they are very poor,\r\nthey may make such an arrangement. It was formerly the custom to kill a\r\nwife if she was unfaithful, but of late the custom has been to dispose\r\nof her to the Yosiwara.\r\n\r\n62. The crime of adultery is to be punished with death (? in the case\r\nof the wife only).\r\n\r\n63. Men and women who commit suicide together are not to receive burial\r\nlike men, but like dogs. If they attempt and do not succeed, they are\r\nto be exposed on the Nihon bas (bridge) for three days, and then made\r\nbeggars.\r\n\r\n64. If a bozan or priest commit adultery, he shall be beheaded. In\r\ncases of fornication, if it be the head priest, he shall be transported\r\nto the islands; if a young priest, he shall be exposed on the Nihon bas\r\nfor three days. (Some years ago one hundred and seventy young priests\r\nwere thus exposed on the bridge at one time by Midzu no Idzumi no kami.)\r\n\r\n65. In cases of persons professing San cho ha (three birds) Foosjiu\r\n(not take), Foossay (not give), they are to be transported. What these\r\nmay mean it is difficult to find out; but possibly they are names for\r\nsome form of religion, either Christianity or Mohammedanism.\r\n\r\n66. No one is allowed to introduce new forms of religion or new gods\r\ninto the country. If they do so, they are to be banished from villages.\r\n\r\n67. In cases of suicide the officers must be informed. If they are\r\nprivately buried with Buddhist burial, both priests and friends shall\r\nbe punished.\r\n\r\n68. Mikassa, Bakuji and Mujing, different kinds of gambling, are to be\r\nseverely punished.\r\n\r\n69. Slight cases of theft are to be punished by flogging and banishment\r\nfrom towns and villages. In more serious cases of theft, the criminals\r\nare first to be carried through Yedo publicly, and then are to be\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\n70. In reference to buyers and receivers of stolen goods.\r\n\r\n71. As to those who engage in a trade without belonging to one of the\r\nguilds.\r\n\r\n72. As to informers.\r\n\r\n73. What steps are to be taken as to persons falling down dead in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n74. As to things lost.\r\n\r\n75. As to accomplices, or persons who indirectly assist criminals to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n76. Forgers are to be beheaded.\r\n\r\n77. As to putters-up of seditious placards on the walls.\r\n\r\n78. What is to be done with a man who (as is sometimes done in Yedo),\r\non meeting a respectable man, suddenly accuses him of striking him, or\r\nsays he is married to his daughter, or gets up some story to extort\r\nmoney from him.\r\n\r\n79. In cases when a man is the indirect cause of loss to another--as by\r\ncoming too late, and so loss is sustained. This is a crime, though the\r\nloss may be small.\r\n\r\n80. Men who give false statements to officers.\r\n\r\n81. As to false money, poison, false medicines, and false weights.\r\n\r\n82. As to setting a house on fire by mistake.\r\n\r\n83. An incendiary is to be burned to death.\r\n\r\n84. A reward to be given to the man who detects him.\r\n\r\n85. As to murder of different kinds. In cases of accidental death, a\r\nfine is to be levied on the homicide. It is said to be a common custom\r\nin Japan to compound for crime by paying relatives and bribing officers.\r\n\r\n86. When a man kills another in self-defense.\r\n\r\n87. If a man kill another by accident, as by a rifle-ball, he is to\r\nbe transported; but if it is done in a military school, he is not\r\npunished. If a working man kills another by accident, he is banished\r\nfrom towns and villages.\r\n\r\n88. If a man is angry with another for marrying a girl he is in love\r\nwith, and breaks in the door and causes a disturbance.\r\n\r\n89. If a man is drunk and angry, and breaks some article of value, the\r\npunishment is to be light; but if several are together, they are to be\r\npunished severely.\r\n\r\n90. If, when drunk, he kills a man by accident, he is not to be\r\nseverely punished.\r\n\r\n91. If a man recovers from sickness and refuses to pay his doctor.\r\n\r\n92. As to offenses committed by mad persons.\r\n\r\n93. If a person under fifteen years of age commit murder,\r\ntransportation is the punishment.\r\n\r\n94. As to concealing criminals.\r\n\r\n95. As to proclamations about offenders.\r\n\r\n96. The officers cannot command a son to inform on or to give up his\r\nfather or mother, or a servant his master, or a younger brother his\r\nelder.\r\n\r\n97. In some cases the relatives of a criminal may be arrested and\r\nconfined, but this Chinese plan is not commonly used in Japan.\r\n\r\n98. Gowo mong--examination by torture, as striking, or pouring water\r\ndown the throat.\r\n\r\n99. As to escaping from banishment on the islands, or crimes committed\r\nduring banishment.\r\n\r\n100. As to escaping from prison.\r\n\r\n101. As to men who free themselves from their irons.\r\n\r\n102. The higher rank a man is of, the more serious is his crime.\r\n\r\n103. And, _vice versa_, a crime is to be considered lighter in a man of\r\nlow degree.\r\n\r\n104. As to criminals who have been banished from towns and villages, if\r\nthey try to return.\r\n\r\n105. If he is ejected a second time he is marked, and if he returns a\r\nthird time he is beheaded. These marks are broad black bands across\r\nthe arm. The different towns (Yedo, Miako, Osaka, and Nagasaki) have\r\ndifferent ways of marking.\r\n\r\n106. If any one shall secretly make weights. All the weights are made\r\nand issued by government in Japan.\r\n\r\n107. In regard to the keepers of the street gates in Yedo, if one shall\r\nfind any money or article of value and keep it.\r\n\r\n108. In Yedo it is the custom to take out a drunken man, or a man that\r\nhas died on the street, and lay him in another. This is to be punished.\r\n\r\n109. If a man accused of a serious crime should die, his body is to be\r\npreserved in salt.\r\n\r\n110. In reference to criminals and prisoners in bad health. There are\r\nfour hospitals for criminals in Yedo.\r\n\r\n111. A criminal whose time is expired, and who has neither home nor\r\nfriends, is to be put to work in Tsukudajima for one thousand days, and\r\nat the end of that time the profits of his labor are to be given him,\r\nand he may get a street gate to keep.\r\n\r\n112. If a man forces a girl to marry him, he shall be beheaded.\r\n\r\n113. Rules as to pawning and pawn-shops. Pawn-shops charge very high\r\ninterest--about ten per cent a month.\r\n\r\n114. If a man be taken ill upon the Tokaido, he is not to be sent from\r\none village to another, but is to be kept, and a doctor sent for to\r\nattend him.\r\n\r\n115. If a man who has no right to do so shall wear two swords.\r\n\r\n116. What is to be done to squatters upon wild ground, who have not\r\ngiven notice to the officers of their having done so.\r\n\r\n117. If a man tries to conceal or prevent the confiscation of his\r\nground.\r\n\r\n118. When the son of a criminal of high rank wishes to shave his head\r\nand become a priest, in some measure to save the reputation of his\r\nfamily, he is to inform the officers and make arrangements with them.\r\n\r\n119. In reference to the children of a criminal, a difference is made\r\nbetween the children of an officer and a common person.\r\n\r\n120. All villages have registers and plans of the ground belonging to\r\neach, and to the families of the villagers. These are sealed and kept\r\nby the head man of the village (nanushi), and he is bound to let any\r\none inspect the registers. If he refuse, and complaint is made, he is\r\nto be punished.\r\n\r\n121. What is to be done upon their liberation with criminals who have\r\nbeen confined for slight offenses.\r\n\r\n122. Different kinds of punishment for different offenses. Of these\r\nthere are specified forty-six.\r\n\r\nIn case of disputes between persons belonging to the four provinces\r\nround Miako, Yamashiro, Yamato, Tanba, and Owomi, they are brought\r\nbefore the street governor of Miako; but if a dispute arises between\r\na person living in one of these provinces and an outsider, the case\r\nis brought to Yedo. Litigation arising in the provinces of Idzumi,\r\nKawatchi, Setsu, and Harima, is brought before the governor of Osaka.\r\n\r\nNo taxes are paid in Miako.\r\n\r\nIf a murder or arson be committed within the territory of a Daimio, it\r\nis not necessary to bring the case to Yedo.\r\n\r\nIf the servants of a Daimio kill the servant of another Daimio the case\r\nmust be brought before the Gorochiu.\r\n\r\nIf a Daimio has no island or place fit for transportation, the\r\ncriminal’s relatives are bound to keep him in confinement.\r\n\r\nThe above is a sketch of the cases which may come before the criminal\r\ndepartment of the Hio jo shio.\r\n\r\nHio jo shio russui are four officers who have charge of the building\r\nwhen not used.\r\n\r\nRo ban.--Keeper of the prison (roya). The execution-ground is at the\r\nsoutheast corner of the prison, under a willow-tree in front of the\r\nback gate. The office of executioner seems to be hereditary. Kubikiri\r\nAsayaymon is at present the executioner, and it is said that his son at\r\nfourteen could cut off a head at a blow. The prison is surrounded by a\r\nhigh embankment, to prevent fires reaching it. If a fire occurs within\r\nthe building the prisoners are all liberated, and those who return have\r\ntheir punishment mitigated.\r\n\r\nJowo ro sama.--These are female officers. They are twelve daughters\r\nof Koongays in Miako, who reside in the palace at Yedo to superintend\r\nall the females, servants, etc., and to look after their manners and\r\nmorals. They are always unmarried while in office, but sometimes marry\r\nDaimios. They generally come to the palace young, and are instructed\r\nthere in their duties. They have the opportunity of having great\r\npower, being at liberty to write to Miako about anything they may deem\r\nimproper either in the conduct of the ladies, women, or men of the\r\ncourt of Yedo, or of the Shiogoon himself.\r\n\r\nOfficers employed in situations at a distance from Yedo.--There are\r\nsix main roads or entrances to Miako; over each of these the Shiogoon\r\nplaces a guard under a Daimio, maintaining in addition a guard in the\r\ncity itself. With the Shoshidai there are nine Daimios resident in\r\nMiako.\r\n\r\nShoshidai.--This is the representative of the Shiogoon at the court\r\nof Miako. It is an office requiring much tact and independence of\r\ncharacter. Formerly it was held by one of the more powerful Daimios,\r\nbut it was found that the tendency to be won over to the party of the\r\nEmperor was great, and it is now generally intrusted to a Fudai. His\r\nduty is to act as a go-between or embassador to the imperial court,\r\nand at the same time report to Yedo all changes. He does not address\r\nhimself personally to the Emperor, or even to the Kwanbakku, but to\r\nthe Tenso, the officer deputed for that purpose, and who in turn is\r\nat times sent to Yedo as envoy from the Emperor. The office is one\r\nwhich entails great expenditure, but it is one in which personal\r\ninfluence may be largely used for the furtherance of intrigue and the\r\nacquisition of power. When Sakai was made Shoshidai, the Shiogoon gave\r\nhim an addition to his income of 10,000 koku per annum. He fell into\r\ndisgrace with the Emperor, and committed suicide in 1862. The Emperor\r\naccused him of telling him falsehoods, while Sakai did not know that\r\nthe accounts furnished him were not true. Had he not committed suicide,\r\nhis property would have been taken from his son. His father committed\r\nsuicide also as Shoshidai at Miako in the time of Kokaku, grandfather\r\nof the present Emperor.\r\n\r\nMiako matchi boonio.--Two officers, governors of Miako, under the\r\nShiogoon, whose duties are similar to those of the governor of Yedo.\r\n\r\nKinri tsuki.--Two officers who act as messengers between the imperial\r\nofficers and the Shoshidai.\r\n\r\nNijio dzei ban.--The castle of the Shiogoon in Miako is called Nijio.\r\nTwo Daimios, and men under them, are appointed guards or governors of\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nThere is a keeper of the storehouses in Miako belonging to the\r\nShiogoon; also a keeper of the weapons of war, guns, great and small,\r\nand an officer who superintends the boats on the Yodongawa, the river\r\nrunning past Miako, to give out licenses and receive the payment.\r\n\r\nFushimi boonio.--A Daimio, governor of the town of Fushimi, near Miako.\r\nHere Taikosama resided, and built the costly palace which was destroyed\r\nby an earthquake. All Daimios have or had residences at Fushimi.\r\n\r\nOsaka jiodai.--Governor of the town of Osaka.\r\n\r\nJiobang.--Keeper or warden of the castle of Osaka, built by Taikosama.\r\n\r\nDzeibang.--Captains of the guards in that castle. Two Daimios take this\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nKabang.--Four Daimios. These three last officers are all together\r\nkeepers of the castle of Osaka.\r\n\r\nOsaka matchi boonio is street governor of Osaka.\r\n\r\nFunate is head officer over the boats and boatmen.\r\n\r\nKohoo, or Kofu.--The capital town of Kahi province, or Koshiu, where\r\nthe Shiogoon has a large castle, built by Takeda Singeng. Hattamoto\r\nthat have fallen into the black books of the government for vicious\r\nconduct, or immorality, drinking, etc., are sent to this castle.\r\nSometimes as many as 500 Hattamoto are there in a sort of arrest, under\r\nsurveillance before being again employed.\r\n\r\nNagasaki boonio.--Governors of Nagasaki, of whom there are two, and two\r\nDaikangs to look after the lands belonging to the Shiogoon. Nagasaki\r\nand the land in the vicinity and the island of Amakusa belong to the\r\nShiogoon.\r\n\r\nNarra boonio.--Governor of Narra, the ancient and ecclesiastical\r\ncapital of Japan, a short distance from Miako.\r\n\r\nSoonpu (Suruga no fu) is the castle of Suruga, built by Imangawa, and\r\noccupied by Iyeyas some years before his death, and afterward occupied\r\nby the ex-Shiogoon, Yoshi hissa. There is a governor of the town and\r\ncastle. At one time the treasury of the Shiogoon was kept at Soonpu.\r\n\r\nSuruga kabang.--One military Daimio. One of the Shiogoon’s physic\r\ngardens for medicinal herbs is at Soonpu, in charge of an officer.\r\n\r\nKowo no san.--Tombs of some of the early predecessors of the Shiogoon.\r\nIyeyas was buried at Nikko, in Simotsuki, a day’s journey north of\r\nYedo. There is an officer in charge of the tombs at both places; where\r\nthere are also, as officers, a keeper of accounts and a gatekeeper.\r\nIn the province of Isse, at the great temple there, the Shiogoon is\r\nrepresented by an officer, Yamada boonio. Over the town of Sakkai, near\r\nOsaka, is a governor.\r\n\r\nOoraga boonio.--The “gate” or seaport of Yedo below Kanagawa, in the\r\nbay of Yedo, has two governors. At Ooraga all junks and boats are\r\nexamined by custom-house officials.\r\n\r\nSado boonio.--Two governors of the island of Sado, where are the gold\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nNeegata boonio.--One governor of the town. This port formerly belonged\r\nto a Daimio, Makino Bizen no kami, but about the year 1840 the Shiogoon\r\ndisplaced him, and gave him Nangaoka, in Etsingo, in place of Neegata.\r\nIt was alleged that an illicit trade was being carried on between Corea\r\nand this port, and also with the Dutch. It is said to be a fine harbor,\r\nand was one of the ports opened to foreign trade by treaty; but the\r\nharbor was found, or supposed to be, too shallow for large ships. It\r\nhas fallen off considerably in trade and wealth since government took\r\npossession of it.\r\n\r\nNikko boonio.--At Nikko Hill is buried To sho goo, or Iyeyas, the first\r\nof the dynasty, and a fine temple (Chiu senji) is erected near the\r\ntomb. The actual tombs of heroes and great men in Japan, as has been\r\nsaid, seem to be generally very modest and unassuming memorials. From\r\nthe roof of the temple at Nikko is hung a large chandelier presented by\r\nthe Dutch. The Shiogoons after Iyeyas are buried, some at the Shibba, a\r\ntemple in Yedo, some at Ooyayno or Toyay san, another large temple in\r\nYedo; others at Kowono san; and at Zozoji, in Yedo.\r\n\r\nGai koku boonio.--Ministers for foreign nations. These officers were\r\nappointed in consequence of the opening of the country, and their duty\r\nis to communicate with the consuls or ministers of foreign nations on\r\ninternational questions, or matters connected with trade. They are\r\nHattamoto of rental varying from 150 to 3,000 koku per annum.\r\n\r\nKanagawa boonio.--There are two Hattamoto, governors of this village,\r\nnow risen into importance. The one is a man of 5,000 koku, the other of\r\n1,200.\r\n\r\nSeki sho.--In the different provinces of Japan there are passes upon\r\nthe roads, where, by reason of the surrounding hills, the road may be\r\neasily defended by a small force. These are considered the keys of\r\nthe country, and at each place barriers (seki) are erected and guards\r\nappointed. These are important from a military point of view.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Segami there are six seki or barriers. Okubo kanga\r\nno kami, Daimio at Odawara, has charge of them. They are--Hakonay upon\r\nthe Tokaido, Neboo kawa, Yangura sawa, Sengo ku bara, Kawa mura, Tanega\r\nmura.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Towotomi there are three gates--Imangiri, Arai and\r\nKenga.\r\n\r\nIn Kowotsuki are fourteen barriers--Fkushima, Goshina, Owo watari and\r\nanother, Oossui, Yoko-ngawa, Koori, Kawa mata, Sarunga harra, Owo\r\nsassa, Dai-ïto, Kari jigu, Minami maki, Tokura.\r\n\r\nIn Etsingo province are five barriers--Itchi foori, Hatchi dzaki, Seki\r\nngawa, Mooshi kawa, Yama ngootchi.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Sinano six--Kin oochi ji, Nami aï, Obi kawa, Ono\r\nngawa, Fkushima, Ni engawa.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Simosa four--Seki yado, Matsudo, Fusa kawa, Nakatta.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Musashi four--Kobo toki, Ko iwa, Itchi kawa, Kana\r\nmatchi.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Owomi three--Yama naka, Yana ngassay, and another.\r\n\r\nAt these barriers no woman is allowed to pass without a passport from\r\nthe governor of Yedo. No Daimio is allowed to bring cannon or muskets\r\npast a barrier without permission. Guards are stationed at each, to\r\nexamine every young person as to sex. This is done in order to keep the\r\nwives and families of Daimios at Yedo.\r\n\r\nIn Sinano province there are large forests, the property of government,\r\non the Kisso hills, under charge of a Hattamoto.\r\n\r\nKoondai (Kiun tai) is an officer who has the superintendence of all\r\nthe Shiogoon’s land in the different provinces in which it lies. One\r\nofficer has generally the lands in two or more provinces under his care.\r\n\r\nDai kwan are smaller and lower offices, with duties similar to and\r\nunder the Koondai. They look after the ground and crops on the ground\r\nbelonging to government. They calculate the amount payable by rice\r\nfields. To ascertain this they frequently cut a tsubo (six feet square)\r\ndry, and thrash it, and calculate the product of the whole field\r\ntherefrom. They receive the rents, make leases, and act as factors on\r\ngovernment lands. There are thirty-seven Dai kwan.\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Mint.--The mint in Yedo is in Drio ngai tcho. It\r\nis under the superintendence of the treasury governor. There is the\r\nKinsa, or the department where gold is coined; and the ginsa, the mint\r\nfor silver coins. Deposits of silver and gold are found in several\r\nparts of Japan, but the most of the gold used by government comes\r\nfrom the island of Sado; the silver is brought from Ikoo no gin sa in\r\nTajima, and from Iwami province. In some of the territories of Daimios\r\nthere are large quantities extracted, as in the lands of Satsuma\r\nand Sendai. The latter has the right of coining money, but the coin\r\nseems to circulate only within his own territory. Silver and gold, as\r\nbullion, are much cheaper relatively to coin than in almost any other\r\ncountry: this arises probably from that peculiarity in the laws and\r\ncustoms of Japan--the Tokusayay, previously mentioned--which prevents\r\nthe natives using either metal as ornaments, or in any useful way. A\r\ngood deal of gold must be used in the manufacture and ornamentation\r\nof the lacquer-ware, which is sometimes profusely covered with gold;\r\nbut, except for this purpose, there is little or none used, as the\r\nladies do not wear jewelry of any kind--neither earrings, nor rings,\r\nnor brooches. No plate is used at their dinners. Owing to this, no one\r\ncan put the precious metals, if they have any in their possession, to\r\nany use, and the owner, in order to realize their value, must take them\r\nto the only market, which is government. The government thus has the\r\npower of declaring what value it will put upon these precious metals,\r\nand pays accordingly for silver bullion thirty per cent below the value\r\nwhich is afterward put upon the coin.\r\n\r\nLastly, among the establishments kept up by the Shiogoon is the Nishi\r\nmaro, literally the west round, the oldest part of the shiro of Yedo.\r\nIt was built by Owota do Kwang, as mentioned before. The castle is\r\nsurrounded by a broad moat filled with water. On the inner side a\r\nfine steep bank of grass slopes up from the water’s edge to such a\r\nheight as entirely to conceal the interior. The water is brought from\r\na considerable distance--from the Tama ngawa River--being led in a\r\ncanal known as Tama ngawa jo sui. This was made by Iyay Mitzko, the\r\nsecond after Iyeyas, and is under the care of the Owometski and Kanjo\r\noffice. The Nishi maro is intended for the occupation of the child or\r\nchildren of the Shiogoon, or for his father if he have abdicated. It is\r\ntherefore frequently empty, and in that case officers have charge of\r\nthe building, who are known as Nishi maro russui.\r\n\r\nWithin the circuit of the castle grounds are the residences of the\r\nGosankioh--the three princes, Stotsbashi, Tayass, and Saymidzu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE DAIMIO CLASS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the official list of Daimios published at Yedo the pedigree of\r\neach is given; the family name and descent; the period when the title\r\ncommenced; the sons and daughters, with the names of their wives and\r\nhusbands; where his residence in Yedo is situated, and likewise his\r\nhouses in Miako, Osaka and Fusimi; the date of his accession to the\r\ntitle; who his wife is; his coats-of-arms, of which each Daimio has\r\ntwo or more; the presents he is to make to the Shiogoon both during\r\nthe year when he resides in Yedo and during that when he resides at\r\nhis provincial residence; the presents the Shiogoon makes to him on\r\nhis coming to Yedo; how his communications are to be carried on with\r\nthe Shiogoon and Gorochiu; the shape and color of the leather covering\r\nof his official spears carried before him, as the spear-points are\r\nalways carried covered with leather; the uniform or livery of his\r\nretainers; the title of his eldest son; the names and titles of his\r\nlarge retainers, or Byshing; the mattoyay or solid ensign carried in\r\nhis train, the flag he carries on his ships, and the large mark upon\r\nhis sails; the amount of his territorial income; the provinces in which\r\nhis property lies; the distance of his residence from Yedo; the room in\r\nthe palace of the Shiogoon to which he goes; the temple in which he is\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nIn the official list the Daimios are classed by families (Kay), from\r\nmany of which families there are cadets or offshoots.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Daimios stand the San Kay, “three families,” Owarri,\r\nKii, and Mito. Iyeyas in his laws calls the first two from their\r\ncities, Nagoya and Wakayama. There are four provinces from which two\r\nDaimios at one time are not permitted to take a title--Mootz, Mikawa,\r\nMusashi and Etsigo. No Daimio is allowed to take his title of Kami from\r\nany of the three provinces, Kadsusa, Hitatsi, or Kowotsuki--they are\r\nreserved for the imperial family.\r\n\r\nOf these Daimios, three are generally known as greater Kokushu; viz.,\r\n1, Kanga; 2, Satsuma; and, 3, Sendai. Fourteen are called lesser\r\nKokushu: 4, Hosokawa; 5, Kuroda; 6, Aki; 7, Nagato Mowori; 8, Hizen\r\nNabeshima; 9, Inaba Ikeda; 10, Bizen Ikeda; 11, Isse no Tzu, Towodo;\r\n12, Awa, Hatchiska; 13, Tosa Yamano ootchi; 14, Sataki; 15, Arima\r\nin Tsikugo; 16, Nambu; 17, Ooyay Soongi. Four are new Kokushu: 18,\r\nEtsizen; 19, Tsuyama; 20, Idzumo; 21, Aidzu.\r\n\r\nThis list comprehends all those who are supposed to be capable of\r\ntaking an active share in the government of Yedo, or in ruling\r\ntheir own districts in the interest of the present dynasty of\r\nShiogoons.[8] When from any cause, such as age or infirmity, a Daimio\r\nis incapacitated from attending to his duties at Yedo, or when he\r\nbecomes tired of the trammels of State to which he is subjected, he may\r\nabdicate, and hand over the dignities or the more irksome part of the\r\nduties of office to his son. If he be suspected of intriguing against\r\nthe powers of the State, he may be displaced, and the title taken from\r\nhim and given to some relative, or any one to whom the Shiogoon may\r\nbe pleased to give it. It seems but rarely that any steps are taken\r\nagainst the person of a Daimio, further than ordering him into arrest\r\nin his own house, which his successor is often too glad to carry into\r\neffect. In the case of a Daimio being accused or convicted of any great\r\ncrime, he may offer to shave his head and become a Buddhist priest,\r\nand so avoid any further consequences. The difficulty of seizing a man\r\nof rank in his own territory has probably led to these compromises.\r\nTherefore the government tries to act through the interest of the\r\nretainers to obtain submission to its decrees. And it is only when\r\na man is powerful enough and wealthy enough (with personal ability\r\nto boot, as in the case of Choshiu in 1866) to carry on war, that it\r\nbecomes necessary to take up arms, and then nothing short of civil war\r\ncan be the result.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this state of things, there is a large number of\r\npersons in Japan who have been Daimios, but who are in a position, real\r\nor nominal, of retirement from the world and its cares. These are the\r\nfathers or brothers or relatives of those who now hold the title, and\r\nwho have probably been put in to fill the position on account of their\r\ntender age. Many no doubt thus retire of their own free will; but the\r\ndisturbances consequent upon Ee Kamong no kami’s vigorous action in\r\n1857 forced others to give up the title and place in order to save them\r\nfor their family. Others have, for the same object, committed suicide.\r\n\r\nDaimios who have thus retired into private life are called Inkio\r\n(Chin., “Yin ku”)--_i.e._, retired into privacy. He is thenceforth\r\nknown generally by the name of his castle or province, with the word\r\nfor “late” or “formerly,” saki no, prefixed to the highest title which\r\nhe bore.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 there were 104 of these Inkio Daimios, whose names are given at\r\nthe end of the peerage, and of whom the following are most prominent:\r\n\r\n1. Owarri, saki no Chiunagoong.--This is the Daimio who was degraded by\r\nthe regent.\r\n\r\n2. Mimasaka, saki no Chiujo.--This is the thirty-fourth child of the\r\neleventh Shiogoon, and known as Kakudo.\r\n\r\n3. Akashi, saki no Shosho, is also a son of the Shiogoon, and was\r\nadopted by Matzdaira Hiobu no tayu.\r\n\r\n4. Ooajima, saki no Shosho. His son is also on the retired list.\r\n\r\n5. Etsizen, saki no Chiujo Shoongaku.--He was degraded by the regent,\r\nbut was restored, and afterward became regent or Sosai.\r\n\r\nA Buddhist name is at times adopted when he does not wish to continue\r\nto bear a title.\r\n\r\nWhen he has shaved his head and becomes a priest, he is called Niudo;\r\n_i.e._, entered the path of Buddha.\r\n\r\nKeng, Sei, Ang, and Eeng are Buddhist titles taken by those who have\r\nretired from the world.\r\n\r\nThe Hattamoto--literally, “the root or foundation of the flag or\r\narmy.”--This rank was formerly called Shiomio, “small names,” in\r\ncontradistinction to Daimio, “great names.” The Hattamoto are officers\r\nof the Shiogoon’s government, who in rank and emoluments come next\r\nto the Daimios. Hattamoto are eligible to fill all the offices in\r\nthe different departments of the Yedo government under the Gorochiu\r\n(to which Daimios alone are appointed). When it is wished to put a\r\nHattamoto into the Cabinet, he is first given by the Shiogoon territory\r\nequivalent to 10,000 koku per annum. A Hattamoto may be described as an\r\nofficer of the government in the possession of land valued from 500 to\r\n9,999 koku. Officers with less than 500 koku are below Hattamoto, and\r\nknown as Go kennin; and beneath them are Ko jiu nin. Lower still are\r\nthe account-keepers; Oto torimi, bird-keepers; Okatchi, spies and men\r\nabout the kitchen; and Yoriki and Do sin. Hattamoto are generally of\r\nthe fifth rank, or Shodaibu, and never of the fourth. Some Hattamoto\r\nhave titles from the Emperor, others have titles of provinces, as\r\nDaimios have, but those who have any titles are a small minority of\r\nthe whole number. Some Hattamoto receive titles for one generation\r\nonly, known as Itchi dai Yoriaï. The class is divided into large and\r\nsmall--the former having from 3,000 to under 10,000 koku of land; the\r\nlatter from 500 to 3,000. They are divided into--\r\n\r\n1. Kotai Hattamoto, or those who go to Yedo on alternate years.\r\n\r\n2. Yoriaï.\r\n\r\n3. Ogo bang.--These live in or have charge of a castle, such as Kofu,\r\nSoonpu, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Shingo bang.--These act as guards to the Shiogoon in Yedo.\r\n\r\n5. O niwa bang.--These are keepers of the gardens, are generally spies,\r\nand consequently avoided by other officers.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal families of Hattamoto are the following:\r\n\r\nSoonga numa, with 7,000 koku, at Shinshiro, in Mikawa province. An old\r\nfamily, proud of the family name.\r\n\r\nMatzdaira Hissamatz is a relative of Matzdaira Oki no kami, related to\r\nthe Shiogoon’s family, and uses the Awoee or crest of the Shiogoon,\r\nwith 6,000 koku; lives at Izassa in Shimosa.\r\n\r\nTakanoya Matzdaira is the lineal descendant of the Nitta family, with\r\n4,500 koku; lives at Nishingori in Mikawa.\r\n\r\nIkoma Tokutaro was, in the time of Taikosama, a powerful Daimio, is now\r\na Hattamoto with 8,000 koku, living at Yajima in Dewa.\r\n\r\nYamano Mondo no ske, also a descendant of the Nitta family; was, in the\r\ntime of Ashikanga, powerful, with 6,700 koku; resides at Mura oka in\r\nTajima, is considered a good family, and, as related to the Shiogoon,\r\nhas special privileges.\r\n\r\nHirano.--His ancestor, H. Gonpe, was a noted warrior in Taikosama’s\r\ntime. The family is much respected, has 5,000 koku, and lives at Sawara\r\nmoto in Yamato.\r\n\r\nKinoshta.--Calls himself of the line of Taikosama, with 5,000 koku. His\r\ncastle is Tateishi in Boongo.\r\n\r\nYamazaki.--Formerly a powerful family, now with 5,000 koku; resides at\r\nNariwoo in Bitsjiu; is descended from the third brother of Hatchimang\r\ntaro.\r\n\r\nMongami, lineally descended from Ashikanga, is looked upon as a\r\nKokushiu; resides at Owomori in Owomi, with a revenue of 5,000 koku.\r\n\r\nKowotsuki, at Kowotsuki in Owomi, with 4,700 koku, is the lineal male\r\ndescendant of the Ooda Genji line.\r\n\r\nBesides these Hattamoto, there are Kotai Yoriaï, who are landed\r\nproprietors of very old families, but who are as Tozama, and take no\r\npart in affairs, such as--\r\n\r\nNassu, a very old family in Shimotsuki.\r\n\r\nMikawa shiu, the line of Iyeyas’s family.\r\n\r\nNakajima Mayra was found in the Mayra district in Kiusiu.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides these, Hattamoto, styled Hira Yoriaï, with revenues\r\nfrom below 10,000 koku downward, such as--\r\n\r\nMinagawa, with 9,000 koku.\r\n\r\nSeigo, and others.\r\n\r\nKondo nobori no ske, with 5,400 koku, who is looked upon as first\r\nHattamoto, not by rank, but because he refused to take the rank of\r\nDaimio from Iyeyas when offered to him.\r\n\r\nKoozai, Foonayoshi.--These two are very wealthy. They were formerly\r\nengaged in trade with the Portuguese in the sixteenth century.--And\r\nmany others, with incomes gradually decreasing to 500 koku per annum.\r\n\r\nHattamoto officers have generally been employed on interviews with\r\nforeign embassadors, or as embassadors to foreign courts on the\r\nconclusion of treaties.\r\n\r\nThose who negotiated the treaty with Lord Elgin in 1858 were--Midzuno\r\nTsikugo no kami, a low Hattamoto. He was afterward disgraced, but in\r\n1862 was appointed governor of Hakodadi, and looked upon as a shrewd,\r\nwily man.--Nagai Genba no kami was also a low Hattamoto. He was also\r\ndisgraced in the changes which followed, but in September, 1862, was\r\nappointed Sa kio, or street governor of Miako.--Inooyay Sinano no kami\r\nwas the minister for naval affairs--was of low origin, the son of\r\na Gokennin. He negotiated the treaty with Mr. Harris, United States\r\nMinister. He was in 1862 made a governor for foreign affairs.--Hori\r\nOribay no kami was considered an upright man and just in his dealings.\r\nAfter the part he took in signing the treaty, he got into difficulties\r\nwith Ando and Koozay in the Gorochiu, and committed suicide.--Iwase\r\nHigo no kami, a low Hattamoto, a very cunning man, since dead.--Isuda\r\nHanzaburo was an obscure Gokennin.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch treaty was signed by Nagai Genba no kami; Okabay Suruga no\r\nkami, a low Hattamoto; and Iwase Higo no kami.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese treaty was signed in 1860 by Misono-gootchi Sanuki no\r\nkami, a high Hattamoto--he was appointed in 1862 general in command\r\nof the castle of Osaka; Sakkai oki no kami, a Hattamoto with 2,000\r\nkoku--he is now governor of the exchequer in Yedo; and Matzdaira\r\nDjirobe--had office in 1862 in the castle Kofu.\r\n\r\nThe embassadors who visited Europe were of the rank of Hattamoto: Take\r\nno ootchi, Simotski no kami, and others. The embassies were accompanied\r\nby agents from the more powerful Daimios, such as Satsuma, Choshiu, and\r\nothers, who reported their observations to their own masters.\r\n\r\nThe Kokay, or Kowokay, as has been before stated, is a class which is\r\nlooked upon as intermediate in rank between Daimios and Koongays. They\r\nare not permitted to take part in the affairs of government. They are\r\nthe representatives of old families, and receive pay from government.\r\nThe class is divided into Kimo iri kokay and Omotte Kokay.\r\n\r\nAmong the former are Hatake yama. His ancestor was a partisan of\r\nYoritomo; his tomb is at Kamakura.--Toki, a general of Ashikanga’s\r\ntime.--Yura, a powerful family in the time of Ashikanga.--Otta, the\r\nlineal descendant of Nobu nanga.--Rokaku; in the time of Yoritomo known\r\nas Sassaki.--Arima, related to Arima, the Roman Catholic.--Imagawa,\r\nformerly lord of Surunga, and builder of Soonpu castle; defeated\r\nby Iyeyas.--Takeda, of the family of T. Singeng, who fought against\r\nIyeyas. And others.\r\n\r\nOf the Omotte Kokay--There are Owotomo, of the family of Owotomo Boongo\r\nno kami, the great patron of the Jesuits in the sixteenth century. At\r\none time a very powerful family, possessing the greater portion of\r\nthe island of Kiusiu, before the power of Satsuma rose to a height.\r\nThe fortunes of the family fell with those of the Jesuits; and to\r\nthe league formed against these foreigners, the confiscation of the\r\nextensive property of Owotomo was the stimulus to energy and the reward\r\nof victory.--Ooyay sungi was very powerful in the province of Etsingo,\r\nand the family for long held the office of Kwanrei at Kamakura. The\r\ndirect descendant of the Nitta line was Jera matz manjiro. He was\r\nnaturally a proud man, and refused to come to Yedo when Iyeyas invited\r\nhim, and, in consequence, he lost his position; but the other Daimios,\r\nwho trace their origin to the same source--the Nitta family--support\r\nhim in a position equal to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe class of officers next below the Hattamoto is the Gokennin. The\r\nhighest income they receive from government is less than 500 koku per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nBeneath the Gokennin, officers come under the general classification of\r\nYakunins or officials--literally, “business men.” This name is applied\r\nto the lower officers employed by the Shiogoon--such as Kumi gashira,\r\nShirabbe yaku, Jo yaku, and Shtabang. There are no Yakunins in Miako;\r\nthere the Emperor’s sub-officials are called Kwannin.\r\n\r\nEvery Yakunin is supposed to swear that he will do whatever, right or\r\nwrong, he is ordered to do by his government.\r\n\r\nIt is not permitted to Gokennin, or to officials of lower rank, to ride\r\nin Yedo or upon the highroads; they must walk.\r\n\r\nSuch being the details of the officers under the Shiogoon, the\r\ngovernment is so well regulated as to have worked with comparative\r\nsmoothness for 250 years. The safeguards and checks which were devised\r\nby Iyeyas have been in operation up to recent times. The setting\r\napart of three families from the members of which the Shiogoon might\r\nbe chosen, gives a powerful support to the reigning family. The\r\ndesignation of four families, from out of which a regent might be\r\nappointed, and the further naming of thirteen families from out of\r\nwhich the Cabinet was advised to be formed, out of the broader basis\r\nof 135 Fudai or working Daimios, who were generally comparatively\r\npoor, gave to all the higher classes a consistency of interest in the\r\nexisting state of things. Power over the person of the individual, and\r\nover his personal power of mischief, in regard to the more powerful\r\nprinces, was sought to be obtained by the detention of the wives and\r\nfamilies in Yedo, and by visiting the sins of an intriguing prince,\r\nnot upon his family or retainers, but upon himself alone. It would\r\nappear that when the Shiogoon is of age, and of sufficient capacity,\r\nhe will appoint his own ministers out of the different families named\r\nby Iyeyas to this end. It is to the interest of the State as well as\r\nof the Kokushiu that they should continue unmolested in the possession\r\nof their extensive territories and jurisdiction; and intrigues are\r\nprevented as far as possible by no one being allowed to visit another\r\nwithin his territories. While the power which the government held over\r\nthe persons and property of these powerful princes, by having the wives\r\nand families as hostages at Yedo, was promoted by the wish for their\r\nwelfare on the part of the husbands or parents, it was kept in force by\r\nthe strange custom of these powerful lords coming up to the court at\r\nYedo every alternate year, or, in some cases, every six months. Perhaps\r\nthis was aided by the dullness of their country quarters compared with\r\nthe gayety of the capital. If the Shiogoon be a minor, or incapable of\r\nholding the reins of power, the ablest or the least scrupulous of those\r\nwho have any claim to the situation becomes regent, and he rules the\r\nempire for the time being. A regency, however, has not been frequently\r\nnecessary during the rule of the present family, but the appointment\r\nhas never been held by one man for more than three years, and the\r\ntenure, it is said, has generally been terminated by assassination.\r\nThe regent removes his political foes, and appoints in their place men\r\nholding his own views. He carries himself as a ruler over men who are\r\nhis superiors in wealth and rank--the Ko kushiu. These men are still\r\nobliged to repair to Yedo, where they find, in place of an acknowledged\r\nsuperior, a haughty inferior, to whom they must pay court. This is one\r\nweak point of the system, and that upon which it threatened to break\r\nup. This forms the last chapter of the history of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe above is a sketch of the court of the Shiogoon, with which one must\r\nbe acquainted before the past history or the current events in the\r\nempire can be thoroughly understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE EMPIRE CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Japan, during the two and a half centuries after the\r\ndeath of Iyeyas, presents a continuous narrative of tranquillity and\r\npeace when contrasted with the stormy times which preceded that era.\r\nThe laws which Iyeyas made, and the steps which he took, seem to have\r\nbrought about the end which he had in view; namely, establishing his\r\nown family as _de facto_ rulers of the empire, and placing them upon a\r\nseat which should be too strong for any rival to overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe peace which was so happily granted to the empire was so perfect and\r\nof such duration that in the year 1806 a great national festival was\r\nheld, when the nobles and people congratulated the Emperor upon what\r\nwas an unprecedented fact in the history of Japan, and indeed it may be\r\nsaid of any nation, an unbroken peace of nearly two hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe only subject of discord left behind him by Iyeyas at his death\r\nwas the question of the treatment of the foreigner in his twofold\r\ncapacity of trader and missionary. The foreigner, as a trader, Iyeyas\r\nwished to retain at his ports, in order that he himself might enjoy the\r\nbenefits of trade, and keep himself acquainted with what was going on\r\nin the world around him. The foreigners, as proselytizing missionaries,\r\nbringing professions of peace and goodwill, but who seemed to be in\r\nreality preachers of sedition and organizers of rebellion, were not to\r\nbe tolerated; and he came to the conclusion, that if any real peace\r\nwas to be obtained for the country, it must be at the expense of the\r\nformer. “Perish trade,” he said, “that my country may have the greater\r\nblessing of peace.” With the view of carrying out his plans, another\r\nedict was, in the year 1616, promulgated against the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion, about which time the evidence of these fathers would lead to\r\nthe belief that, “from Taikosama’s death, 1598, to the year 1614, the\r\nfathers of the Society baptized upward of 104,000; and what is more,\r\nin the first three years of the persecution, when the very pillars\r\nthemselves began to shake, they converted 15,000 more. By this time\r\nthe Jesuits had traversed the whole empire, and claimed converts, not\r\nonly in Yedo, but in Oshiu (or Mootz) and Dewa to the extreme north.\r\nThe province of Oshiu is separated from Dewa by a long chain of high\r\nmountains all covered with snow, and here it was that the poor exiled\r\nChristians lived, destitute of all human assistance. One of the\r\nJesuits, moved with compassion at their misfortune, took a journey into\r\nthat country, climbing up the hills over hideous precipices in deep\r\nsnow. He visited privately the Christians that wrought in the mines,\r\nand confessed and communicated them. The same he did at the hospital\r\nof lepers, which happened to be at that time full of Christians.” This\r\nwas, as we are told, done quietly, and by the assistance of converts;\r\nbut, as heretofore, while some of the different orders of the Roman\r\nChurch were disposed to keep quiet till better times should dawn, and\r\ncarry on their ministrations in secret, as it were, others were still\r\ninclined to show a zeal without knowledge, and thus kept up the ardor\r\nof their enemies about the court. During the year 1626 Midzu no and\r\nTake naka were sent down to Nagasaki to examine into and report upon\r\nthe state of the Christian religion; and the government, knowing that\r\nthe Cross was the symbol of the faith, and an object of the highest\r\nreverence among the Christians, resolved to make the question of such\r\nreverence the shibboleth or test of the individual strength of faith.\r\nIn 1636 orders were issued by government that every one in Nagasaki\r\nwas to assemble each month for the purpose of standing upon, with the\r\nobject of desecrating, a copper “ita,” or plate, with an engraven\r\nrepresentation of the Christian criminal God--_i.e._, of our Saviour.\r\nThis order was strictly carried out at Nagasaki, while another such\r\nplate was (and is) kept at Osaka for the purpose of testing suspected\r\npersons. This act of desecration is known as “Yayboomi,” and was\r\ncarried out till the recent conclusion of treaties with Christian\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThis last device of the government appears to have been successful in\r\nseparating the Christian element from the heathen; but it terminated in\r\na way which was, perhaps, not expected by the authorities; namely, in\r\ndriving the poor Christians of the island of Kiusiu to band together,\r\nand ultimately in desperation to take up arms in their own defense.\r\nHad the Christians resorted to this _ultima ratio_ at first, instead\r\nof leaving it as the last card they had to play, the result of the\r\ngame might have been different from what it turned out to be. Refusing\r\nto perform such an act of irreverence and desecration, they were\r\nobliged to fly to the hills and band together for the common object\r\nof protection. The numbers increased until they amounted to upward of\r\n40,000 men. The most prominent leader among them appears to have been\r\nMassida shiro, fourth son of Jimbe, in Kobemura, in Hizen province;\r\nand he was assisted by two brothers, Oyano Kozayaymon and O. Kemmootz.\r\nThese are probably the two brothers to whom Tavernier, the great\r\nEastern traveler, alludes in an appendix to his work, when he mentions,\r\non the authority of one Father Barr, who seems to have been in Japan\r\nat the time, that “none were more zealous or faithful to the Christians\r\nthan the two lords of Ximo, Francis and Charles, sons of the lord of\r\nBuzen.”\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholics who had been recently forced out of the city of\r\nNagasaki and the town adjacent gathered themselves together under the\r\ncommand of Massida, and resolved to make a final stand in the island\r\nof Amacusa, at that time belonging to Terasawa, formerly governor of\r\nNagasaki, and under the charge of his retainer Miako tobe. The first\r\nmove of this Christian army was to seize the castle of Tomioka. This\r\nput them in possession of the island, after which the army crossed over\r\nto occupy the castle of Simabara, situated about twenty miles from\r\nNagasaki, and meditated an attack upon that town. The movements of both\r\nparties seem to have been slow, as, after a delay of twelve months,\r\nthe government issued orders to the Daimios of the island of Kiusiu to\r\ncollect, equip and send forward an army under the command of Itakura\r\nSuwo no kami to besiege the castle and town of Simabara. Itakura,\r\nprobably acting upon the advice of his augurs, the Buddhist priesthood,\r\nattacked the city upon the first day of the year, and was killed in the\r\nattempt, when the command devolved upon Matzdaira Idzu no kami, with\r\nToda san mong and Matzdaira Sin saburo. After sustaining a siege of\r\ntwo months, and repelling several attacks, the Christians were at last\r\novercome and the castle was taken. The whole of the persons found in\r\nthe city--men, women, and children--were massacred, to the number of\r\n31,000. The three leaders were taken, together with a woman, beheaded,\r\nand the heads put up on the gate of the Dutch factor’s house at Hirado.\r\nAfter the affair was over, the native accounts say that “the guns from\r\nNagasaki were of great use, therefore he presented money.” The factor\r\nat the time appears to have been named Koekkebekker, and the statement\r\nthat money was presented implies in the native account that it was\r\ngiven to the Dutch for the assistance derived from their cannon, which\r\nare said to have fired from a ship and a battery on shore 426 balls.\r\nA great deal has been made of this against the Dutch, as using their\r\ninfluence to extirpate Christianity from the empire; but when the guns\r\nwere demanded by the Japanese, the Dutch factor was powerless to refuse.\r\n\r\nA few native vessels were at this time permitted to trade with China,\r\nHainan, Formosa, and Tonquin; and there must have been a considerable\r\nnumber of Japanese collected in Macao and its neighborhood, some\r\nprobably traders or runaway sailors, others as refugees on account\r\nof religion, or as being educated for the priesthood. Up to a recent\r\nperiod the remains of a large building with a garden-wall were visible\r\non the Lappa, opposite Macao, which was known to the Chinese as the\r\n“Yut pone lao,” or Japanese hall, now better known as the “Fan kwei\r\nlao,” or hall of the outer devils.\r\n\r\nAccording to native history, in the year 1640 some of the “Jashiu mong”\r\n(one of the names by which the Roman Catholic sect was known in Japan)\r\ncame to Kagosima in Satsuma. Orders were given to the inhabitants\r\nnot to speak to and not to listen to these foreigners. Two officers,\r\nKangatsume from Miako and Baba saburo from Nagasaki, were ordered to\r\ninvestigate and communicate the result. They found that “there were\r\nin one ship seventy-three men of this sect; of this number sixty were\r\nbeheaded, and the remainder were sent to the islands.” This is the\r\nway in which native authors put the arrival and treatment of four\r\nPortuguese gentlemen who were sent as embassadors to Japan from Macao\r\nin order to endeavor if possible by a last stroke to reopen the trade\r\nwhich had been lost. The four gentlemen, with their suite and the crews\r\nof the vessels to the number of sixty men, were beheaded at Nagasaki,\r\nwhile the remaining thirteen were sent back to Macao to inform the\r\nauthorities there of the treatment they had received. In the Cathedral\r\nof Macao may be seen a painting of the execution of these embassadors.\r\n\r\nDeeply regretting the loss of the trade of Japan, and nothing daunted\r\nby the fate of these envoys, King John, upon ascending the throne\r\nof Portugal after the separation of the kingdom from the dominion of\r\nSpain, thought it a good opportunity to attempt to reopen negotiations;\r\nand with this view Don Gonzalo de Sequeyra was dispatched with two\r\nvessels and numerous presents to pave the way. He was, though more\r\nfortunate, not more successful than those envoys sent from Macao. By\r\nthe accounts of native historians, “two black ships came to the island\r\nof Iwoga sima, south of Satsuma. They said they were all Nanbang men,\r\nand that there was not one Roman Catholic [priest?] among them. The\r\ncaptain said, ‘My country’s king is now changed. I have a dispatch from\r\nthe new king, and I wish it to be forwarded as soon as convenient to\r\nYedo.’” Inooyay and Yamagaki were sent from Yedo to make inquiries.\r\nThey demanded that the powder and guns should first of all be given\r\nup, and then they would hear what the envoys had to say. The captain\r\nreplied, “‘Trading is a matter which concerns all countries. If Japan\r\ndoes not choose to trade with us, that is her affair, but the guns and\r\npowder cannot be given up.’ Thereupon all the Daimios in the island of\r\nKiusiu were ordered to hold themselves in readiness with men and boats.\r\nThe name of the envoy was Kom sa aru,” etc., in which an attempt was\r\nmade to write his name in Japanese sounds. He said he was a relative\r\nof the King of Portugal. Answer was sent down from Yedo to the effect\r\nthat these ships had committed a serious offense, but that they should\r\nbe dealt leniently with, and were to be ordered to leave the shores and\r\nnot to return. After staying in all forty-three days, the two vessels\r\ndeparted. They had two captains and 400 men. The one was 156 feet long\r\nby 42 broad; the other was 144 feet long by 36 broad. Each vessel had\r\n20 large guns. After this visit orders were given to the Kiusiu Daimios\r\nto have always in readiness a force of 55,000 men and 997 guard-boats\r\nfor the protection of the coasts. In the year 1666 another edict was\r\nissued against the Roman Catholics, so that it would appear that some\r\nsparks of the faith were still lingering here and there, which the\r\ngovernment feared might at any moment be fanned into flame.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1709, Abbé Sidotti, an Italian priest of good family,\r\ndetermined to devote himself to the cause, and to make another attempt\r\nto regain Japan to the Church of Rome. With difficulty he found a\r\ncaptain of a vessel trading at Manila, who agreed to put him ashore on\r\nsome point of the coast, and there to leave him to his own resources.\r\nWhen off the coast of Satsuma a boat was lowered, and the abbé, with a\r\nfew small coins in his pocket, was put on shore. The boat returned, and\r\nthe ship sailed away. After a long interval, a report reached the Dutch\r\nfactory, through Chinese, that the abbé had been taken and immured\r\nbetween two walls, and allowed to perish of hunger. But this has lately\r\nbeen disproved by the discovery of a full account of his arrest and\r\nexamination, and detention about Yedo until his death, which does not\r\nappear to have taken place for many years. This was the last effort\r\nmade by the Church of Rome to regain the footing she had lost.\r\n\r\nHidetada, the son and successor of Iyeyas, would seem not to have\r\npossessed the talents or firmness of his father, but he had the\r\nadvantage of his father’s advice and assistance during the greater\r\npart of his rule. His son, Iyaymitz, when he was capable of ruling,\r\nand had come to the office of Shiogoon, found that the spirit of the\r\nDaimios had been softened by the long peace. The yoke of the Tokungawa\r\nfamily did not gall their necks, and they preferred peace and ease in\r\nthe assured possession of their estates, to the risk and violence of\r\nwars and constant disturbance in the empire. Iyaymitz on more than one\r\noccasion visited the Emperor in Miako with great pomp, but a real or\r\nsuspected attempt to assassinate him seems to have put a stop to these\r\nvisits.\r\n\r\nThe year 1634 is given as the date at which the custom of the Daimios\r\nvisiting Yedo on alternate years commenced. The Daimios coming to Yedo\r\nand returning from it are spoken of as Sankin and Kotai. The custom\r\nseems to have been long in use in Miako, but in a more temporary way,\r\nand simply as being a duty of each lord to visit and pay his respects\r\nat the imperial court once a year when they offered presents. This\r\nvisit was by Iyeyas transferred to his court at Yedo and Soonpu; but it\r\nappears to have fallen into desuetude and irregularity during the life\r\nof Hidetada. But Iyaymitz, who was an able, proud, and precise ruler,\r\nfound that his father had not been much respected by the Daimios, who\r\nstill retained the recollection of the wars and prowess of Iyeyas; but\r\nin course of time these men were succeeded by their sons, who were of a\r\nmore effeminate spirit, and had no such associations. Iyaymitz, taking\r\nadvantage of this change, invited all the Daimios to visit him at Yedo,\r\nwhen he proposed rules for their visiting and residing at his court,\r\nto which they all agreed, swearing fealty, and signing the deed each\r\nwith his own blood drawn from above the nail of the finger. A hall had\r\nbeen built on the Goteng yama, a rising-ground near Yedo, in which the\r\nShiogoon was to meet the Daimios on their arrival; but under Iyaymitz\r\nthe custom was discontinued and the ground made public.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, the “Court of Deliberation,” the Hio jo sho,\r\nwas established in Yedo, with the view at the outset of investigating\r\ncharges brought against Daimios. The Mayassu hako, or box for\r\ncomplaints, now standing in front of the Hio jo sho, was not placed\r\nthere till the year 1721.\r\n\r\nOne Shiogoon after another succeeded to the throne, not always without\r\nsuspicion of unfair means being used to hasten the conclusion of the\r\nreign. It is generally believed that Tsuna yoshi was killed by his wife\r\nwhen he was on the eve of proclaiming the son of Yanangi sawa, one of\r\nhis ministers, his successor. The heir was Iyay nobuko, the son of\r\nthe eldest son of Iyaymitz; the father, when a young man, having been\r\nsent to the castle of Kofoo under arrest on account of irregularity of\r\nconduct. In the year 1716, on the death of the infant Shiogoon, Iyay\r\ntsoongu, a difficulty occurred as to the succession, when Yoshi mone,\r\nwho was of the royal house of Kii shiu, was selected by the Kokushu,\r\non the recommendation of Eeyee kamong no kami, then Regent. Having\r\nabdicated in 1745, he died in 1751, and is reputed as one of the ablest\r\nand wisest of the Shiogoons of the dynasty. The next Shiogoon was Iyay\r\nhige; and during the rule of his successor, Iyay haru, about 1765, a\r\ncommon foot-soldier, Tanuma, rose to be chief minister, a position and\r\npower which he used not only to gratify his own evil propensities,\r\nbut to disseminate the same corruption over the empire. Preventing\r\nall communications with the Shiogoon, he did what was right in his\r\nown eyes; forbade all persons to study; changed the laws; and devoted\r\nhimself and the empire to debauchery. He was made a Daimio, and placed\r\nat the head of the Cabinet. A conspiracy formed against him failed,\r\nand the principal conspirators were beheaded; but he was at length put\r\ndown by Matzdaira Etsjiu no kami, who published at this time the “Tenka\r\nhatto, mikka hatto,” or three days’ proclamation over the empire.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are proud of and delight in the beautiful scenery of their\r\ncountry; and every one who has opportunity, including nearly all the\r\ninhabitants, male and female, makes a walking tour at some period of\r\nhis life over the country, visiting the more remarkable temples, which\r\nare generally placed in favorable sites amid woods, and surrounded\r\nby fine forest-trees, the immediate precincts being kept with the\r\nmost scrupulous care and nicety of gardening. Nowhere are the temples\r\nmore magnificent or the scenery finer than about Miako; and it had\r\nbeen for long the custom for the Emperor to go out and visit some one\r\nof the temples in the neighborhood of Miako, and offer worship. In\r\nthe year 1722 a day was set apart in spring, and again in autumn, on\r\nwhich the whole court should annually go out on a sort of gigantic\r\npicnic--the Emperor drawn in a car by oxen, and accompanied by all the\r\nKoongays--when they visit some of the temples most renowned for their\r\nsanctity or for the beauty of the grounds. This procession is called\r\nMiyuki or Gokowo. There are two gardens adjoining the palace in Miako,\r\nShoongakuji and Katsura, which are said to be most exquisitely laid\r\nout and kept in beautiful order. The gardeners who have the charge\r\nof these gardens belong to a class or sect known as Gayra, a people\r\nwho live apart by themselves in a few villages in the neighborhood of\r\nthe capital. They are said to have kept themselves apart in customs\r\nand religion for many generations. In religion, they say there is\r\nbut one God, and that all men below the Emperor are equal. They, as\r\nQuakers with us, will not use terms of respect to other men, such as\r\n“kudasare,” or call men by titles, as “sama,” similar to “esquire”;\r\nsaying that they only adhere to old customs in so doing. They are\r\nthemselves respected as being of old and pure descent, and their\r\nchildren are often selected by Koongays for adoption. They principally\r\nfollow the occupation of gardeners, or that of breeders of horses.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1639, the Portuguese and Spaniards having been expelled,\r\nand the Dutch factory alone left at Hirado, the commissioner was\r\nordered to remove his people and offices to the small factory on\r\nDesima, “the Outer Island,” at the head of the inlet of Nagasaki, and\r\ntrade was prohibited at all other places in Japan, and to any other\r\nnation, with the exception of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Dutch and their position on these seas, the\r\npirate commonly known as Coxinga is worthy of notice. Koku seng ya, as\r\nhe is known in Japanese history, was the son of a Chinese, Ching tsing\r\nlung (Tayshi rio in Japanese), by a Japanese woman. The father was for\r\nmany years, as pirate and admiral, the terror of the Chinese seas.\r\nHis son succeeded him in his former capacity, and reduced the coasts\r\nof China to such a state of terror and devastation, that an order was\r\ngiven, as a desperate remedy, that every person should remove into the\r\ninterior to a distance of twelve miles from the shore, leaving the\r\ncities to decay and the fields to waste. In 1647 Coxinga went over to\r\nJapan, and offered his services to, or asked the assistance of, the\r\ngovernment in an attack he meditated upon China; but his application\r\nwas refused. He seems to have again applied to the government in\r\n1658, when he turned his attention to the island of Formosa. A large\r\nnumber of Japanese converts had fled to this island, and the Dutch had\r\nbuilt one or two forts with the view of protecting a trade which they\r\nhoped might grow up with China. In 1662 Coxinga attacked and captured\r\nthe fort Zelandia, putting to death nearly all the Dutch soldiers,\r\nmissionaries, and their wives and families. Only a few men and some\r\nof the young women were not killed. A curious but melancholy sigh is\r\nwafted over from this long-forgotten remnant of Dutch Christianity and\r\ncivilization in a letter which was brought to Japan about the year\r\n1711 by the captain of an English vessel who had touched at Formosa\r\non his way out; and as the letter comes through a Japanese channel,\r\nthere is no reason to doubt its authenticity. The captain, in answer to\r\ninterrogations, says, “There is no war in Tonay [Formosa] now, and we\r\nhave no trade there. The Dutch head man asked me to give the following\r\nletter to the Dutch commissioners in Nagasaki: ‘Please ask Japan to\r\nhelp us; we are now shut up as in a prison, and every day we weep. The\r\nnames of the Dutch in Tonay are [here the names are given in Japanese].\r\nI hear that this English vessel is going hence to Japan; therefore we\r\ntake the opportunity of sending this letter to you. The Tonay country\r\nwas seized many years ago; but we are still alive, but we are in a most\r\nmiserable state. Please help us to return to our country. We pray you\r\nto speak to the Kogee [Kubosama].\r\n\r\n“‘Signed by the head man Yohang Hoorohooro, and two others.\r\n\r\n“‘There are ten women and several children here.’”\r\n\r\nNicolas Verburgh seems to have been the name of the officer in command\r\nof the fort at the time of its capture in 1662, and the signature, as\r\nwritten by a Japanese, closely corresponds to the pronunciation of the\r\nname, and Yohang may have been his son John. From the tenor of the\r\nletter it seems hardly possible to doubt but that these were some of\r\nthe survivors of the Dutch captured in 1662; and if so, it is curious\r\nto have such a fact coming to light through Japanese informants, and\r\nmelancholy to think of such a tedious captivity lightened up after\r\nfifty years by the hope of once more revisiting their home, and being\r\nredeemed from their never-ending misery.\r\n\r\nThe name of this English ship is not given, but native history tells\r\nus that the captain brought with him an exact copy of the treaty or\r\nletter signed by Iyeyas, traced upon paper, and expressed a wish to\r\ncommunicate with the Shiogoon at Yedo. A Dutch interpreter was sent to\r\nsee if there were any Portuguese on board. The guns and muskets were\r\ntaken ashore. There were eighty-four of a crew on board. The captain’s\r\nname was Sayemon Terohoo (Simon Drew?). The ship was 114 feet long by\r\n27 broad. Then follows a list of articles on board--ammunition, which\r\nwas taken charge of by the Japanese: Gunpowder, 35 tubs; balls, 660;\r\nleaden bullets, 2 tubs; iron bullets, 1 tub; small stone bullets, 8\r\ntubs; matchlocks, 47; flint muskets, 23; spears, 24; swords, 339.\r\n\r\nThere were on board, as presents for the Shiogoon, “one fine English\r\nmusket, double-barreled, 3 feet 3 inches in length; four muskets with\r\nvery intricate and finely-made locks, besides eight others which cannot\r\nbe used, but are very well made; and four molds for making balls.”\r\n\r\nThe cargo consisted of cotton, woolen and cotton cloth, furs, fragrant\r\nwood, chintz, scented water, quicksilver, looking glasses, tin, silk,\r\ncrape, etc. The captain was interrogated as to his religion, as to the\r\nPortuguese, and as to a change he had made in the national flag which\r\nhe sailed under, which he explained by saying that he was told the\r\nJapanese did not like the cross.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch had carried on their trade at the island of Hirado, where\r\nan extensive land-locked bay is pointed out as the harbor. They\r\nwere ordered in 1639 to leave that port, and in future to resort to\r\nNagasaki, where a small island, which was afterward connected by a\r\nbridge with the town, was appointed them as a place of residence\r\nand for trade, being about the same size as the factories at Canton\r\noccupied by foreigners till 1856.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were made by other nations, at long intervals, to\r\nreopen a trade with the country; but it was thought by the Dutch to\r\nbe their interest to oppose any such competition, and the Japanese\r\nthemselves dreaded, with good cause, any renewal of the former state of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe national annals during the period which elapsed between the era\r\nof Iyeyas and the reopening of the country advert to a number of\r\noccurrences of temporary and local importance only. The comparatively\r\ntrivial nature of these tends to bring out into relief the continued\r\nquiet and rest which the country has enjoyed under the form of\r\ngovernment established by Iyeyas, and after all complications arising\r\nfrom dealings with other nations were forcibly put an end to by the\r\nexpulsion of foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe Daimio Fkushima Massanori was banished in 1619 to the island of\r\nHatchi jo for a series of cruelties practiced upon his family, his\r\nservants, and his people, which show that he was deranged; and his\r\nextensive territories, occupying three provinces, were confiscated.\r\n\r\nIn 1621 the Emperor married the daughter of the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\nThe temple of To yay zan was built in Yedo for the occupation of the\r\nhigh-priest, who is alluded to in the laws of Iyeyas as being appointed\r\nto fill that position as a near relative of the Emperor, and one whom\r\nthe Shiogoon may place on the throne in case of rebels siding with\r\nthe Emperor in opposition to the Shiogoon. He is the most illustrious\r\npersonage in Yedo. The grounds are very beautiful, and formerly\r\nbelonged to the family of Todo.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1631, about the month of November, it is curious to observe\r\nthat the annals take notice of a prodigious number of ironstones having\r\nfallen from heaven, showing that the meteoric orbit has been crossing\r\nthat of the earth as visibly two hundred years ago as it does now.\r\nThis occurrence probably took place during the day, as at other times\r\nthese meteors are spoken of as falling stars.\r\n\r\nThe aqueduct by which water is led from the Tamangawa to Yedo, and\r\nthence discharged into the castle and town by wooden pipes, was\r\nconstructed in 1653. Proposals have been made at different times to\r\nsubstitute iron pipes, but the wooden ones still remain--a cause of\r\nconstant expense to the government.\r\n\r\nThe burning of the palace at Miako, or of that at Yedo, is one of\r\nthe most common occurrences in these annals. Titsingh gives a vivid\r\ndescription of a conflagration which occurred in 1788 in Miako, during\r\nwhich the attendants of the Emperor killed more than a thousand persons\r\nbefore he could be carried out of danger.\r\n\r\nThe government in Japan reserves the privilege of selling weights and\r\nscales guaranteed by mark and certified as correct. The weights as now\r\nused were settled in 1662.\r\n\r\nIn 1666 a new edict was issued against the Roman Catholic religion;\r\nand in 1668 an order was promulgated prohibiting any new Buddhist\r\ntemples being erected. In all probability the Buddhist priesthood\r\nhad been exalted by their victory over the Roman priesthood, and had\r\nagain acquired so much power as to be once more threatening to disturb\r\nthe equilibrium of the state. The zeal of individuals had perhaps\r\nbeen again endowing new and enriching old establishments, actuated by\r\nfeelings with which the state powers did not wish to sympathize. Only\r\nfour years before this edict, the enormous copper idol of Buddha at\r\nMiako had been melted down and coined into copper “cash,” and a wooden\r\nfigure was substituted. If it be true, as is asserted, that it was\r\nthree or four times the size of the figure of Dai boods, near Kamakura\r\n(at present existing in copper, and upward of forty-five feet in\r\nheight), it must have been of considerable value in coin.\r\n\r\nThis edict against the erection of new temples is still in force in\r\nJapan, and while it is aided by a growing want of zeal in the hearts\r\nof the people, with a contempt for the priesthood, it may be broken\r\nthrough by the permission given to repair, or restore, or enlarge any\r\ntemple already existing, however small it may be; and as a temple or\r\nshrine is standing upon nearly every knoll or eminence in Japan, there\r\ncan be no difficulty, were the funds forthcoming, of raising such\r\nedifices as were raised of old by the zeal of fervent worshipers.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist priesthood in 1720, by a great religious festival all over\r\nthe empire, commemorated the eleventh centenary of the establishment of\r\nBuddhism.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese claim the discovery and settlement of the Bonin or Monin\r\nIslands in the year 1683. The name means “no men,” or uninhabited.\r\nAttempts were made to colonize the islands, but they seem to have\r\nfailed; and some English and Americans, with Sandwich Islanders, male\r\nand female, succeeded them. But in 1862 the Japanese government fitted\r\nout a vessel and carried away all these adventurers, bringing them to\r\nYokohama, and it seems to find the islands a convenient distance to\r\nwhich they can send vessels to train officers and men.\r\n\r\nA work was commenced in 1786 which was expected to have proved of great\r\nadvantage to Yedo. This was the cutting of a canal, and thereby joining\r\nseveral already existing channels, by which a through communication\r\nwould have been opened up between Yedo, or the Bay of Yedo, and the\r\nPacific Ocean on the east coast. The part of the province of Simosa\r\nbetween Yedo and the east coast is very low land, and it is generally\r\nbelieved that at one time the sea cut off the three provinces of\r\nSimosa, Kadsusa, and Awa, which then constituted a separate island; and\r\nthat the detritus brought down, after a course of nearly two hundred\r\nmiles, by the largest river in Japan, the Tonay, has filled up with\r\nalluvium the sea channel, leaving now only the passage for the fresh\r\nwater of the river. In the course of the filling up, however, a large\r\nlake was left, the Een bang numa. About twenty miles above Yedo, the\r\nTonay, coming down as one river from the Tonay district, divides into\r\ntwo. The one branch, receiving affluents from Hitatsi and the northern\r\nprovinces, runs due east as the Bando taro, or “eldest son of Bando,”\r\nand enters the sea between Choshi and Itaku on the east coast. The\r\nother branch, running south, enters the sea to the east of the city\r\nof Yedo. The Okawa, or Great River, runs parallel with the Tonay, and\r\npasses through Yedo spanned by five bridges. Between the Okawa and\r\nTonay, and running parallel to, and communicating by canals with both,\r\nis the Nakagawa or Middle River. By these cross canal communications\r\nthe passage may be made from Yedo to the Pacific on the east, or to the\r\nnorthern provinces by running up to Seki Yedo, where the bifurcation\r\ntakes place. It was proposed to deepen the lake, and cut through a\r\npassage from it into the Bay of Yedo.--The lower part of Yedo is so\r\nlow that it is liable to be overflowed should the Tonay rise above its\r\nbanks. To avert this danger, a large and important embankment, the\r\nGongen do, has been made at Koori hashi. Should this give way, the\r\nwhole of the lower parts of Yedo would be submerged, as happened, it is\r\nsaid, in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe town of Sakura first started the project, and commenced a canal,\r\nbut did not finish the work. The Shiogoon, seeing the advantages of the\r\nproposed cut, ordered the Daimios to cut the remainder of this canal\r\n(of about fourteen miles in length), each cutting as his share about\r\n360 feet. The work, which was immediately commenced, was in six months\r\nhalf completed, when orders were given to cease working at it. In 1843\r\nthe work was recommenced by orders of government, but when it was\r\nwithin three thousand yards of being finished it was again stopped, and\r\nit continues in that position to this day.\r\n\r\nThe river and canal communications in Japan are more ramified than the\r\nmountainous nature of the country would lead one to expect. It is said\r\nthat Yedo might, by short canals, be put into water relations with\r\nMito on the east coast and Negata on the north, as boats can go up the\r\nTonay to Shimidzu, within eight miles of the navigable part of the\r\nNegata waters; while Miako might be joined by water to Tsurunga on the\r\nnorth and Owarri on the south. By private enterprise, in the year 1832,\r\nthe Yodo ngawa between Miako and Osaka was deepened and improved by\r\nthe removal of some rocks. It is said that the Katsura gawa, or Hozu\r\nkawa, now a large affluent of the Yodo gawa, formerly ran to the north\r\nthrough the province of Wakasa; but a private individual, Yodo yo, cut\r\na channel by which this river now flows southward into the Osaka River.\r\nHis family is permitted to levy tolls upon the new channel.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of fearful convulsions of nature is one of the most\r\nremarkable circumstances in these annals; and it may be presumed that\r\nonly the most severe are noticed. But recent observations go to show\r\nthat almost every day there is an observable motion of the earth at\r\nYokohama from subterranean causes. The native accounts of these, with\r\ndrawings, give an appalling idea of the suddenness and the severity of\r\nearthquakes. In the year 1707 a very severe earthquake shook the whole\r\nof the southern part of the island of Nippon, and simultaneously from\r\nthe side of the mountain Fusiyama [Fusi--literally “not two,” or none\r\nsuch] issued an eruption of volcanic matter. This eruption continued\r\nfor fifteen days; and at Yedo, a distance of seventy miles, dust fell\r\nto the depth of two feet. Fusiyama had not given any appearance of\r\nvolcanic action for centuries. The projection on the smooth outline of\r\nthe hill on the northwestern side marks the place where this action\r\ntook place, and is known as Ho yay zan. At the same time the volcano\r\nAssama yama, in Sinano, broke out into violent action, by which the\r\ntwo adjacent provinces were laid under lava or dust. The same mountain\r\nbroke out again in 1783, and of the destruction done at that time\r\nTitsingh gives a fearful account. He gives details of an earthquake\r\nwhich occurred in 1793 at Simabara, during which a large portion of\r\nthe mountain was swallowed up; and the boiling sulphurous springs of\r\nOnzen, memorable during the persecutions of the Christians, were dried\r\nup. The fear of the inhabitants was quickened by the recollection\r\nof the eruption of Assama yama, in Sinano, only ten years before.\r\nThe inhabitants, with their houses, were engulfed in the openings of\r\nthe earth; they were carried away by boiling water issuing from the\r\nhill; they were killed by falling stones and enormous rocks; they were\r\nsurrounded and burned by streams of fiery lava; they were drowned by\r\nthe stoppage of rivers. Some were found suspended from trees, some on\r\ntheir knees, some on their heads in mud, the streets strewed with dead\r\nbodies. The falling houses immediately took fire, and the unfortunate\r\ninmates were burned, or were confined prisoners. The outline of the\r\ncoast was completely altered, and the country converted into a desert.\r\nA number of vessels were sunk at their anchors, and those which tried\r\nto get away could hardly do so from dead bodies and floating wood.\r\nFifty-three thousand are known to have perished in this earthquake in a\r\ncomparatively thinly populated district.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 a tremendous earthquake and volcanic eruption took place in the\r\nprovince of Etsingo, during which, at Nadatchi, a large mountain was\r\nengulfed and disappeared. This province seems to be entirely undermined\r\nby fire. The volcano Taka yama is called the entrance to hell. Oil\r\nsprings from the ground. Combustible gas issues in such quantity as\r\nto be used for cooking and lighting, by simply inserting pipes in the\r\nground. Phosphorescent appearances are seen in many parts. Soda is\r\nfound in the province in large quantities. Here many flint arrow and\r\nspear heads have been found, exactly similar in shape to those found in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of these earthquakes is a reason for nearly all the\r\nhabitations of man being built of wood; and by long experience builders\r\nhave arrived at certain modes of building, by which the great danger of\r\na house coming down upon the inmates is in many cases obviated. They\r\nseem to depend upon the roof for weight; and the piles upon which this\r\nheavy roof rests are not fixed firmly into the ground, but some of\r\nthem are fixed slightly into a square framework of wood, laid on stone,\r\nwhile the others stand simply each upon the surface of a large, round,\r\nhard, water-rolled stone, which has been firmly imbedded in broken-down\r\nsandstone. By this means the snap of a sudden shock is avoided, and\r\nsome slight motion is allowed. Whatever be the principle upon which\r\nthese houses are erected, it is wonderful to see buildings, which seem\r\nto be put up in a shape the most ready to topple over upon the least\r\nmotion, withstand the shocks of earthquakes for ages. There are pagodas\r\nin many parts of the country of seven and even nine stories high. At\r\nKamakura is a temple with a narrow circular neck, above which the eaves\r\nof a square roof project to about ten feet on every side, resembling\r\nthe projection of a Chinaman’s hat. If it could withstand the wind, it\r\ncould never be expected to resist an earthquake; and yet it is said to\r\nbe two hundred years old, and seems as sound as when it was built.\r\n\r\nThe annals do not disdain to mention the visits of the Emperor to\r\nwitness theatrical exhibitions, or proceedings of the Shiogoon in quest\r\nof sport.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese appear to be very partial to the theater, and there seems\r\nin the nation an innate aptitude for such representation. But while\r\nthe government regulates this, as it does every other branch of the\r\namusements as well as the education of the people, actors as a class\r\nare looked upon as the lowest in the scale of society. The female parts\r\nare generally taken by boys.\r\n\r\nSome companies go about the country composed entirely of boys or young\r\nchildren, none of whom are apparently upward of ten or twelve years\r\nof age. The people enjoy these very much, and will take their meals\r\nand sit all day watching the different acts, applauding vigorously at\r\nwhatever they appreciate in acting, or what may amuse them in the play.\r\nNothing seems to excite their feelings and evoke their applause more\r\nthan a well-acted suicide by stabbing the abdomen. During the evenings\r\nmany minor places of amusement are open, such as jugglers, marionettes,\r\nand tellers of stories. Wrestling by professionals is another\r\nspectacle which always draws a very large concourse of spectators,\r\ngenerally male; but women are on occasions to be seen viewing the\r\nmaneuvers of the contest with the greatest interest. These spectacles\r\nhave been well, though perhaps over, described by Commodore Perry.\r\nBesides these full-grown wrestlers, companies go about, having under\r\ntuition boys of from eight to twelve years of age, who wrestle with all\r\nthe pomp and circumstance of their full-grown compeers. The same laws\r\nregulate the game under the formal umpire. A successful wrestler is\r\nhailed with loud applause; and under the influence of the excitement of\r\nthe moment, money is frequently thrown to the conqueror, or for want of\r\nit men will throw their coats or napkins, which they afterward redeem.\r\n\r\nThe long peace subsequent to the time of Iyeyas, though unbroken by\r\nany national disturbance, was not wholly free from local events, which\r\nmight, had they been fanned, have broken out in serious trouble. In\r\n1837, Osaka and the neighborhood were disturbed by a rising which\r\nwas instigated by an officer, Oshiwo, who, by the distribution of\r\nmoney and by placards, excited the people of the city against the\r\nauthorities. During the riot, which may be said to have lasted only\r\none day, nearly all the principal shops in Osaka were pillaged and\r\nburned. The ringleader escaped, but was afterward discovered, though he\r\nblew up the house in which he was hiding before he could be arrested.\r\nNotwithstanding that the government exercises such surveillance over\r\nthe people, and that one-fourth of the community seem to be spies\r\nupon the remainder, risings of the people do occasionally take place.\r\nThese riots are especially frequent in the provinces of Oomi, Sinano,\r\nand Kahi. In the latter, during 1838, a rebellion broke out which\r\nthreatened to be somewhat more formidable than usual. Several high\r\nofficers and many men on both sides were killed. In truth, in the\r\nprovince of Kahi (or Koshiu) the people are great politicians and\r\nunruly, and at the same time under some sort of volunteer organization.\r\nOfficers are in general somewhat afraid of an appointment to the\r\nprovince, as the farmers are wealthy, and keep their servants well\r\nsupplied with arms, which they teach them how to use. A strong force is\r\nalways kept at Hatchioji, twenty-five miles from Yokohama on the road\r\nto Koshiu, as a protection to Yedo.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1701 an occurrence took place which terminated in a\r\ntragedy, and has ever since been one of the national tales of revenge,\r\nwhich, though it was confined to a few individuals, has conferred on\r\nthem immortality, and the admiration of their countrymen as heroes.\r\nAssano, a Daimio from Ako, in the province of Harima, while within the\r\nprecincts of the Shiogoon’s palace, was insulted by a Kokay of the name\r\nof Kira, when a quarrel and scuffle took place, during which Assano\r\ndrew his sword. This was looked upon as such a heinous offense that\r\nhe was ordered to kill himself, when the government confiscated his\r\nproperty, reducing his family and retainers to poverty. The retainers\r\n(known as Geeshi), exasperated by this severity, banded together\r\nfor revenge, and forty-seven proceeded to the house of Kira, when a\r\nfight commenced, which was carried on during the whole night till the\r\nmorning, by which time they were able to penetrate to his apartment\r\nand kill him. The whole forty-seven then proceeded in a regular and\r\nmethodical manner to commit suicide. They are all buried at the temple\r\nof Sengakuji, near the temple first occupied by the British Legation.\r\n\r\nIn 1672 the powerful Lord of Sendai was put to death by his own\r\nservants. He also is memorable in Japanese story, but more on account\r\nof his baseness and cruelty, which he showed by a trait of character\r\noften chosen as a subject by native artists. Being a man given up to\r\ndebauchery and the gratification of his passions, he became enamored\r\nof Takawo, the most beautiful courtesan of Yedo at the time. He wished\r\nher to accompany him to his castle in the north, but she refused. She\r\nhad an aversion to him, but the offer of her weight in gold probably\r\nprevailed with her, or with those in whose possession she was, to give\r\nconsent. He took her with him, and on the way to his castle, upon\r\nasking her if she was not happy, she replied that she was not, when in\r\na rage he drew his sword and cut off her head.\r\n\r\nThe occasions upon which European vessels communicated with Japan\r\nduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries seem to have been few,\r\nand at long intervals. About 1637, Lord Waddell, with some ships,\r\ncalled in at Nagasaki, but was not allowed to communicate with the\r\nDutch.\r\n\r\nIn 1673, 1768, 1791, 1793, 1796 and 1803, notices occur in the native\r\nannals of the visits of foreign vessels.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, the “Phaeton” frigate, under Captain Pellew, paid a visit\r\nto Nagasaki during the time when Holland was at war with England.\r\nAccording to native accounts, the captain wished to carry off the Dutch\r\ncommissioner. For that purpose he landed his men (in a boat made of\r\nleather?), who displayed the usual playful habits of English sailors\r\nin a foreign town, “striking everybody, and breaking everything they\r\ncould.” The Prince of Hizen was not on the spot; the governor of\r\nNagasaki was quite unprepared; the Prince’s lieutenant proposed to burn\r\nthe frigate by means of fire-boats, but the frigate sailed before any\r\nsteps could be taken. The governor of the town, the Prince of Hizen,\r\nhis lieutenant and the guards, are all said, by native accounts, to\r\nhave committed suicide.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, during the time when Holland was absorbed by France, Sir\r\nStamford Raffles sent a vessel from Java with a Dutch officer to take\r\nthe place of the representative of Holland then at Nagasaki; but the\r\nman in possession was able to prevent his opponent landing, and held\r\nthe place till he was relieved in 1817.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, the “Cyprus,” a vessel containing some convicts who had\r\nrisen and murdered the crew, touched at Tanega. The “Morrison,” which\r\ncommunicated with Japan shortly after, heard of some foreigners who had\r\nlanded on the island of Tanega and forcibly carried off cattle.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, American vessels came to Nagasaki to beg permission to trade,\r\nand in 1849 some English vessels touched at Uranga.\r\n\r\nThe native record of events concludes by stating that in 1858 treaties\r\nwere concluded with five nations--American, English, Dutch, Russian,\r\nand Portuguese--and that silver boos were exchanged for dollars. That\r\nin 1859 the Regent, Ee Kamong no kami, was assassinated; and the\r\nfollowing year was that year in the cycle in which, recurring once in\r\nsixty years, it is permitted to women to ascend Fusiyama.\r\n\r\nThe history of the empire is now brought down to a very important era,\r\nwhen relations with European nations are about to be reopened, but, in\r\ncomparison with her past experience, at a great disadvantage to Japan,\r\nin so far as she had to meet foes greatly in advance of herself in the\r\npractical application of scientific investigation to the art of war,\r\nand when she allowed herself further to be outwitted in the diplomacy\r\nof treaty-making. The wars and animosities of European powers had\r\nfor a long time drawn them away from the East and concentrated their\r\nattention nearer home; and the history of their withdrawal from the\r\nEastern Seas is that of the struggle among European nations for the\r\nsupremacy of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe English retired from Japan as a field of trade about the year 1623.\r\nThe hatred of Holland to Spain and Portugal gave vigor to her efforts,\r\nand she drove their ships from the East, and remained in possession\r\nof the field, such as it was. By driving away competitors, however,\r\nthe Dutch undermined their own position, and deprived themselves of\r\nsupport, moral as well as physical, and fell gradually into a position\r\nof contemptible dependence for the retention of a worthless trade.\r\n\r\nFrance appears to have made a feeble attempt, at the time when Colbert\r\nwas Minister, to open up a trade with Japan, under the advice probably\r\nof Francis Caron, who had been Dutch commissioner at Nagasaki. In\r\nChardin’s Travels may be seen a letter addressed to the envoy, giving\r\nmost minute instructions as to his conduct and treatment of the\r\nJapanese. Some of these might even be read with benefit by envoys of\r\nthe present day. “You shall keep your finest clothes, and which you\r\nhave never wore in Japan, as shall likewise those of your retainers,\r\ntill you are brought to court, and till the day of your audience. As\r\nsoon as you shall arrive there, you shall cause your retinue to provide\r\nthemselves with little leather pumps and slippers. The floors of the\r\nhouses are covered with tapestry in Japan, for which reason you must\r\nput off your shoes when you enter them, and have some without quarters\r\nthat you may quit them with greater ease.”\r\n\r\nThe United States of America came late into the field in Japan, but\r\nit may be said that the national action toward Japan has had a wider\r\ncosmopolitan influence than any other act since the Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nThe opening up of China, and the enormous trade which followed in\r\nopium, silk, and treasure, caused by steam on the one hand and the\r\ndiscovery of gold in California on the other, together with the rapid\r\nadvance in steam itself, all combined to force a traffic around Japan,\r\nand to place these islands on the very highway of commerce. It became\r\nevery day more obvious that from one side or other, either from the\r\nEnglish on the side of China, from the Russians on the north, or from\r\nAmerica on the east, some attempt must be made before long to insist\r\nat least upon some measures of civil behavior, if not of genuine\r\nhospitality, being shown to vessels which required assistance, or which\r\nmight be wrecked upon the coasts of Japan.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 an attempt was made by the United States government to endeavor\r\nto break down, if possible, the system of exclusion kept up by Japan by\r\nthe dispatch of two vessels of war, under Commodore Biddle, with the\r\nview of feeling the way toward a better acquaintance with the country.\r\nThe result was not satisfactory, the commodore having been grossly and\r\nperhaps intentionally insulted.\r\n\r\nMr. Fillmore, the President of the United States, determined to make\r\nanother effort to break down the barrier, and to make such a display\r\nas should show the Japanese that he was to a certain extent in earnest,\r\nand at the same time prevent any recurrence of such conduct toward his\r\nenvoy. It is needless to discuss whether the Dutch or the Russians had\r\nany claim to priority of action in the matter. Commodore Perry has\r\nendeavored to overthrow any such claims; but such great political steps\r\nare seldom the result of a sudden outburst of vigor--it was gradually\r\napproached from all sides. It was, as has been said, one of the effects\r\nof the great innovator, steam, with other concurring circumstances,\r\nsuch as the opening of China and California, and the conversion of the\r\nPacific Ocean into a highway of commerce. The breaking-up by British\r\ntroops of the sham of the Chinese as a military nation, no doubt\r\nopened the eyes of Western nations. Japan lay in the way. No nation\r\nhad a better claim to ask it to relax its restrictions upon friendly\r\ngrounds than America. No nation was, perhaps, better suited to carry\r\nout the diplomatic part of such a proposal, whether the character of\r\nits officers as individuals, or the generally peaceful professions\r\non the part of the government, be looked at. There can, further, be\r\nlittle doubt but that the United States government was exceedingly\r\nfortunate or prudent in its choice of the man for the work. He had some\r\nacquaintance with Orientals learned in the school of China, and he\r\nbrought this to bear practically upon his present work. He says he was\r\nconvinced that, if he receded from any point which he had once gained,\r\nsuch would be considered as an advantage gained against him--that\r\nfirst-formed impressions among such people carry most weight--that with\r\npeople of forms it is necessary to out-Herod Herod in assumed personal\r\nostentation and personal consequence--that a diplomatist ought with\r\nsuch persons never to recognize any personal superiority, and ought\r\nalways to keep aloof from conversation or intercourse with inferiors,\r\nand yet cultivate as far as possible a friendly disposition toward the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nCommodore Perry left the President’s letter on July 8, 1863, for the\r\nconsideration of the Japanese government. He returned in February,\r\n1854, when the Japanese government returned for answer that they had\r\ndecided to accede to the propositions of the President, and appointed\r\nfive commissioners to treat with Perry. The treaty was signed at\r\nYokohama, and ratifications were exchanged in February, 1855. Although\r\nthe treaty was signed and the negotiations brought to a successful\r\ntermination, this was not accomplished without difficulty and even\r\ndanger, as, according to native accounts, a large force was collected\r\non the hills overlooking Yokohama, under the command of different\r\nDaimios. These forces occupied about fifteen miles of ground between\r\nFusisawa and Kawasaki to the number of a million of men (but numbers\r\nare indefinite in the East). They seem to have suffered a good deal\r\nfrom sickness while lying there, and were afterward the subjects of\r\nmany jokes and caricatures. It was arranged that if any serious hitch\r\ntook place, or any appearance of force was exhibited on the part of\r\nthe Americans, a large bell was to sound, and other bells were to take\r\nup the signal, and a general combined attack was to be made. Idzu no\r\nDaikang volunteered to kill Perry with his own hand, so deeply does\r\npersonal feeling enter into national questions in Japan; but this he\r\nwas ordered not to attempt.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, during the Crimean war, Sir James Stirling, then admiral on\r\nthe China station, with H.M.S. “Winchester” and a squadron, anchored in\r\nNagasaki with the object of concluding a treaty with Japan. The last\r\narticle of the treaty was to the effect that “no high officer coming\r\nafter to Japan should ever have power to alter this treaty.” For this\r\ntreaty the admiral received the thanks of the nation through the House\r\nof Commons. It may by some be thought a mistake not to have stood upon\r\nthe old treaty given to England by Iyeyas in the seventeenth century,\r\nwhich would have been considered more binding upon the government and\r\nupon the empire than a treaty made when the position of the Shiogoon\r\nwas once more being questioned.\r\n\r\nThese treaties were a step forward, but had this step not been followed\r\nup they would soon have become inoperative.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend Harris was appointed consul for America at Simoda, and\r\narrived there in 1856; and being in constant intercourse with the\r\nJapanese authorities, he concluded a convention by which further\r\nadvantages were gained by the Americans. The Japanese government\r\nthought that if the further concessions brought no more trouble than\r\nwhat had resulted from the little opening already made, they might,\r\nwithout much danger, open the sluices a little more; and in 1858, Mr.\r\nHarris, after much negotiation, arranged the articles of a commercial\r\ntreaty (based upon the treaties with China), which was signed by\r\nhim and the Japanese commissioners upon July 29, 1858. After this\r\nwas settled, Holland, Britain, Russia, and France concluded similar\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the trumpets which had been blown to herald the approach\r\nof the American squadron to the shores of Japan had reached those\r\nshores long before the vessels themselves. The government was informed\r\nthrough the Dutch of the coming mission. The American government does\r\nnot seem to have intended anything further than ostentatious display in\r\nthe number and size of the vessels sent. They did not propose to follow\r\nup a refusal to open their doors, on the part of the Japanese, by any\r\nwarlike operations. But the Japanese government does not appear to have\r\nbeen aware of this, and at the time they may have felt some doubts as\r\nto whether their late treatment of foreigners did not call for some\r\ndisplay of power on the part of European nations. Commodore Biddle had\r\nbeen grossly insulted on board a vessel of war. The crew of one vessel\r\nhad been very unkindly treated, and, according to native report, more\r\nthan one vessel had recently been wrecked on the coasts of Japan,\r\nand the crews treated with severity until they died out. Until the\r\nsquadron should arrive, the Japanese could take little or no action.\r\nBut they waited with much anxiety the arrival of the expedition. It was\r\nconsidered as a most important event, fraught with much either of good\r\nor evil to the country--which was it to be?\r\n\r\nThere is a pamphlet, published in Yedo, which professes to give some\r\naccount of the doings in Japan at this time, and which is interesting\r\nas showing the internal state of Japan at this most critical time in\r\nher history, and the feelings with which the proposed opening of the\r\ncountry was viewed by different political parties. The views of the\r\nEmperor are set forth; the daring acts of the Regent in support of\r\nhis own position; the intrigues set on foot against him, ending in\r\nhis assassination, and the subsequent train of events which followed\r\nthereon, and which have led to the overthrow of the Shiogoon’s\r\nposition and the restoration of the Emperor to the power originally\r\nheld in the imperial hands. The letters may appear to be tedious, but\r\nthey show the working of the government more clearly perhaps than a\r\nsimple description would do. The country was threatened with internal\r\ndisturbance, and there were two parties divided upon the point of a\r\nsuccessor to the Shiogoon, who was weakly in mind and body--worn out\r\nand epileptic. As leader of the one party was Ee Kamong no kami, the\r\nhead of the Fudai Daimios, and having a certain right to be appointed\r\nRegent in case of necessity. He seems to have been a clever, bold\r\nman, to Western ideas unscrupulous in the means by which he attained\r\nhis ends. At the head of the other party was Mito, one of the “three\r\nfamilies,” hereditary vice-Shiogoon in Yedo, and connected by marriage\r\nwith the families of the Emperor and the highest Koongays in Miako, and\r\nwith the wealthiest Daimios--a shrewd, clever, scheming old man. What\r\nfollows must be considered a mere imperfect sketch of what the pamphlet\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nThe name of the pamphlet is a play upon the name Mito, meaning\r\nWater-door--Midzu Kara Kori. “Water machines make,” or “A machine made\r\nat Mito.” The Regent (whose name, Ee, means “a well”) wished to take\r\nout, as with a bucket, the water in the well and divide it--_i.e._, to\r\nbreak down the power of Mito.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet commences by stating by way of “contents” that the Regent\r\nsent Manabay Simosa no kami to Miako to seize Takatskasa, the highest\r\nofficer of the empire, the Kwanbakku and his son Daifu dono, and\r\nAwata, a young relative of the Emperor, and at the time the head of the\r\nBuddhists--and that these high officers were all put into confinement,\r\nand that all this trouble had its origin at Mito. The source of the\r\nTokungawa--_i.e._, the line of Iyeyas, or the government by the family\r\nof Iyeyas--is very clear, but this work will show how Mito tried to\r\nmake it impure. The book was published in the spring of 1860. The name\r\nof the author is “Every one drunk.”\r\n\r\nThe anticipated arrival of the United States squadron was agitating the\r\nrulers of Japan, and parties were divided as to the reception which\r\nshould be given it. There was probably some political source of discord\r\nbesides this, connected more or less with the office of Shiogoon,\r\nwhich had fallen into the hands of an epileptic imbecile. It would\r\nappear that in 1854 letters were sent to all the Daimios and Ometskis,\r\nrequiring them to give their opinions as to the reception which should\r\nbe given to the squadron, and whether the Americans should be repelled\r\nby force, or whether a trial should be made of a limited intercourse\r\nwith foreigners, under the impression that if it was not found to work\r\nsatisfactorily the ports might again be closed, and the country might\r\nreturn to its old state of seclusion. The answers sent showed that they\r\nwere divided into a large majority for repelling them, by force of arms\r\nif necessary, and a small minority who were for admitting foreigners\r\nto trade. All agreed that it was a question of peace or war, but many\r\nthought that whether it was to be the one or the other, no answer\r\nshould be sent until time was obtained to put the shores and batteries\r\ninto a state of defense. At present, they alleged, the coasts were weak\r\nand defenseless, and “if Japan does not conquer it will be a great\r\ndisgrace, and the country will be defiled. But, high and low, all must\r\nbe unanimous.” In the first place, it must be ascertained how many men\r\neach Daimio can muster, and the strength of each in guns, ammunition,\r\netc. In 1854, in the tenth month, the Ometskis sent letters to all the\r\nDaimios to obtain information on this head.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, in the 9th month, the Shiogoon sent a commission to Mito,\r\nordering him to put all the coasts of the country into a defensible\r\ncondition. The care of the forts along the shore was to be committed to\r\nMito. The forts and guns were to be examined. The Shiogoon wrote--“You\r\nhave hitherto come to me three times every month, now I wish you to\r\nreport to me every second day what is doing.”\r\n\r\nFrom published documents, it appears by the Emperor’s own letter,\r\n22d day of the 2d month, 1858, in corroboration of what is stated\r\nin the pamphlet quoted, “that this matter was discussed before him\r\nby the Kwanbakku (Koozio dono), the Taiko, or previous Kwanbakku\r\n(Takatskasa),[9] and the Tenso. It appears that the old Taiko pleaded\r\nas an excuse that he was unwell, but as the Mikado sent several times\r\nto command his attendance, he was obliged to come. At the conference\r\nthe Taiko expressed an opinion contrary to that of the others, which\r\nhad been given in favor of the course advocated by the Shiogoon. The\r\nMikado was very angry” (with these others), “and it was with difficulty\r\nthe Kwanbakku succeeded in pacifying him. On the 23d a document bearing\r\nthe refusal of the Mikado to the treaty was written out. Then three\r\nofficers went to the residence of Hotta, the Shiogoon’s first Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs and Envoy to Miako, to obtain the Mikado’s consent\r\nto the American treaty, and informed him of the document hereunder.\r\nThe messengers sent by (to?) the Mikado were afflicted, and shed tears\r\nbecause they did not succeed.”\r\n\r\nThe Mikado wrote to the Shiogoon: “23d, 2d mo., 1858.--It is difficult\r\nfor us to grant you the approval you ask” (to the treaties). “For the\r\nhonor of the name of the first Mikado it is impossible to agree to it.\r\n\r\n“It is our duty to take care to tranquilize the minds of our people.\r\n\r\n“The Shiogoon should gather every one’s opinion, from the three great\r\nhouses to the humblest subject, and give me the result in writing.\r\n\r\n“If it is necessary to ... conclude these treaties” (_i.e._, if it is\r\nimpossible to go back from what has been done), “exception must be made\r\nof the country in the neighborhood of my imperial city, as we have\r\nalready directed in our letter, 24th of the 12th month. [The opening\r\nof] Hiogo in Sitsu must be excepted if possible.\r\n\r\n“The Mikado often considers that he is not safe in his palace at Miako,\r\nand he directs the Shiogoon to appoint some powerful Daimios to protect\r\nthe imperial palace.\r\n\r\n“You have thought it well to open the ports to foreigners, but you did\r\nnot think that foreigners would entangle you with difficulties.\r\n\r\n“We would know your opinion in this respect.”\r\n\r\nThis was evidently considered a refusal on the part of the Emperor to\r\naccede to the conclusion of a treaty. There is not much appearance of\r\nwhat is by a commentator called “puppetism” in the position of the\r\nEmperor when he, standing here almost alone in his council of bribed\r\nand intriguing officers, who were all in the pay of the Regent at\r\nYedo, still manfully keeps them all at bay, and, assisted only by his\r\nfaithful old minister the Taiko, whose attendance he is obliged to\r\ncommand, refuses to accede to the course of expediency pressed upon him\r\nby such meanness. He not only refuses, but he warns them from his lofty\r\nposition of the pit which he foresees they are digging for themselves.\r\nThe Taiko, probably for his conduct and words at this meeting, was put\r\nby the Regent in confinement in his own house, and was only released\r\nafter the fall of this minister.\r\n\r\nThen follows a document, a “Circular from the Shiogoon, the 6th month\r\nof 1858, by Kooze yamato no kami.\r\n\r\n“The Mikado having been consulted by the Shiogoon’s government about\r\nthe making of treaties with foreigners, he answered that the conclusion\r\nof that matter would distress him very much.\r\n\r\n“Thereupon the Shiogoon requested all to send their written opinion\r\nupon the subject. Only a short time was required to gather every one’s\r\nopinion; but, in the meantime, some Russian and American men-of-war\r\ncame here, bringing the news that in a short time English and French\r\nmen-of-war would arrive here; that these two nations had fought and won\r\nmany battles in China; that they would come here in the same warlike\r\nspirit, and it would be difficult for us to negotiate with them. The\r\nAmerican embassador offered to us, that if we would make a temporary\r\ntreaty with him, as soon as we should have signed and given him that\r\ntreaty he would act as mediator between us and the French and English,\r\nand could save us from all difficulties.\r\n\r\n“It was impossible for us to comply with this without consultation with\r\nthe Mikado. However, Inoe Sinano no kami, fearing the immediate assault\r\n(or breaking out of a war), the results of which might be the same as\r\nin China, signed themselves, as men authorized to sign [this expression\r\nis somewhat suspicious], the American treaty at Kanagawa, which treaty\r\nwas given up to the American embassador.\r\n\r\n“Necessity compelled the Japanese to do this.\r\n\r\n“The Mikado, on hearing of this, was much troubled, but to reassure him\r\nwe told him we would fortify our shores.”\r\n\r\nThen further follows a document written by several of the Koongays in\r\nMiako:\r\n\r\n“At this time there are great changes taking place in our holy country\r\nin respect to foreigners. However, it is not for us ignorant people\r\nto judge, and for that reason we lately wrote twice to the Mikado. We\r\nhoped that he would consider the subject.\r\n\r\n“We write to him once more. Since the time of Tensio dai jin the\r\ncountry has been to the present time sublime and flourishing; but\r\nfriendship with foreigners will be a stain upon it, and an insult to\r\nthe first Mikado (Zinmu). It will be an everlasting shame for the\r\ncountry to be afraid of those foreigners, and for us to bear patiently\r\ntheir arbitrary and rough manners; and the time will come when we\r\nshall be subservient to them. This is the fault of the dynasty of\r\nthe Shiogoon. It is reported that the Shiogoon has sent to Miako to\r\nconsult the Mikado about the treaties, but it is impossible to believe\r\nit. Hotta will return to Yedo and say that the Mikado has consented\r\nto give him a secret authorization, and he will thus induce the other\r\nDaimios to follow the party of the Shiogoon. The Shiogoon thus disturbs\r\npeace. If foreigners come to our country they will loudly proclaim the\r\nmutual benefits that trade will produce, but at home they will think\r\nonly of vile profit; and when we shall refuse to comply with all their\r\nwishes, they will threaten us with their artillery and men-of-war.\r\nThey intend to take Japan, and to effect this will resort to any kind\r\nof deep scheme in their negotiations. It is earnestly wished that the\r\nMikado order that the Daimios from the ‘three families’ to the lowest\r\ngive their vote upon the subject.” The Daimios gave their vote, and\r\nthey were generally in favor of exclusion of foreign nations, and of\r\nadhering to their old way.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, on the 28th day of the 12th month, Hino came to Yedo from\r\nMiako, as bearer of a letter from the Emperor addressed to the Shiogoon.\r\n\r\n“Your duty is to act as Shiogoon; and yet you, being Se i dai Shiogoon\r\n[barbarian-quelling commander-in-chief], are unable to perform your\r\nduties. You ought to know what the duties of that office are, and\r\nyet our foreign enemies (eeteki) you are unable to punish. You have\r\nmany high officers with you, and this matter is one of the utmost\r\nimportance; therefore I wish you to come as soon as you can to Miako.\r\nIf you are unable to come on account of the business of the empire,\r\nthen you must dispatch some able and experienced officers, that I may\r\nhear myself what is doing. At the present moment all Daimio, Shomio\r\nand Shonin (people) are in perplexity. Why is this? It is because the\r\nbusiness of the Shiogoon office does not go straight. On this account\r\nI have every day great trouble, and therefore I have commanded Koojio\r\nKwanbakku to send Hino, and to communicate orally with you.”\r\n\r\n(This letter is supposed by some not to have been written by the\r\nEmperor, but to have been a forgery by the Koku shiu and higher\r\nDaimios.)\r\n\r\nMito, in 1855, had been very active and serviceable in telling the\r\nother Daimios that it was all very well to talk of fighting, but that\r\nthey must first know what means they had. He had been appointed to look\r\nafter the defenses of the empire. It may be presumed that the more\r\npowerful of the opposite party were annoyed with his obtaining this\r\nappointment, and with showing them their weaknesses, and had cabaled\r\nagainst him under the headship of Ee Kamong no kami.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th day of the 12th month of 1857, the letter was given by\r\nHino to the Shiogoon; and the same night a meeting of all Daimios\r\nwas held in the Siro jo in, a large hall in the castle of Yedo. The\r\ndeliberations were not over till two o’clock in the morning of the 30th.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, on the 23d day of the 4th month, Ee Kamong no kami was\r\nappointed Regent (Gotairo). He was a Sho sho or major-general, and had\r\nbeen brought up while a boy as a Buddhist priest. Probably by this\r\ntime the Shiogoon was become quite imbecile, and it became necessary\r\nto appoint a regent. Ee, being of an age and capacity fit for the\r\nsituation, had the first claim. He seems to have all along taken a\r\ncourse opposed to Mito, probably arising out of attempts to obtain\r\nthis office; and as Mito was strenuously opposed to the admission of\r\nforeigners, Ee took the opposite side, and declared for the new state\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th day of the 7th month a communication was made to Owarri, the\r\nfirst of the “three families,” to the effect that “the Shiogoon regrets\r\nto have to notice the conduct of Owarri, and that he cannot longer hold\r\nfriendly communication with him. It is the will of the Shiogoon that\r\nOwarri in future shall confine himself to his house at Toyama in Yedo,\r\nand abstain from official business, and that he shall not speak to any\r\none. That, further, all his territories shall be confiscated, and they\r\nare handed over to his relative, Matzdaira Setsu no kami,” who was then\r\na child.\r\n\r\nTo Mito a somewhat similar communication was made, and ordering him to\r\nconfine himself in his house at Koma (ngome near Oji).\r\n\r\nThese commands, dictated by the Regent, were forthwith carried into\r\nexecution. The smaller Ometski were appointed to see that such\r\nsentences were carried out. One result was that a great number of\r\nthe poorer retainers of these chiefs were thrown on the country as\r\n“floating men,” or Ronins, with their two swords to gain themselves a\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nTo Hongo Tango no kami, member of the Wakatoshi yori, a similar letter\r\nwas sent, and he was deprived of the half of his territory and confined\r\nto his house.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, Ishikawa Tosa no kami was fined the half of his\r\nterritory, and a doctor to the Shiogoon, Hoka Riki, was turned out\r\nof his office and all his property taken from him. But his son was\r\npresented with 250 piculs of rice per annum, as he had shown himself on\r\nthe side of the Regent.\r\n\r\n(There is no mention in this work of similar treatment being shown to\r\nthe great lords, Satsuma, Tosa and Etsizen.)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of the 8th month, the name of Harutaka, son of Kii\r\ndainagoon, was changed to Iyay mutchi. This is the boy whom the Regent\r\nand his party had put into the place of power, the Shiogoon having been\r\ndead for some time. It was given out that he was unwell, and the Regent\r\nhad been taking means to strengthen his position against Mito. Mito\r\nclaimed the place for his own son, who had been adopted by Stotsbashi,\r\nwho was the third son of the ninth Shiogoon. The youth who succeeded\r\nwas the nearest heir, according to European ideas; and Mito’s claim had\r\nthe defect, that if adoption carried the full consequences which he\r\nwished it should, it militated against himself.\r\n\r\nThe 9th day of the 9th month was the day chosen for the nominal death\r\nof the Shiogoon. Ee Kamong no kami was much with the late Shiogoon\r\nbefore his death, and gave out that he had ordered him to act as Regent\r\nduring the young man’s minority.\r\n\r\nManabay Simosa no kami, one of the Cabinet, was sent by the Regent to\r\ncarry out his schemes in Miako. He returned in the 12th month, and a\r\nfew days after his return abdicated his honors and his territory.\r\n\r\nHotta, who had acted as envoy from the Regent to Miako, was degraded.\r\nOn the 26th day of the 11th month, the two highest officers, Koo jio\r\ndono the Kwanbakku, and Ni jio dono Nai dai jin, came to Yedo as envoys\r\nfrom the Emperor.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of the 12th month the title of “Se i dai Shiogoon” was\r\nconferred on Se i sho sama Iyaymutchi by the Emperor, by the hands of\r\ntwo chokushi or envoys. The Empress also sent an envoy to the Shiogoon\r\nto compliment him upon his obtaining the title, and perhaps also to\r\nlay the first proposal as to his marrying the Emperor’s younger sister\r\nKadsumia.\r\n\r\nDuring the 12th month, Manabay went down to Miako with orders to\r\nIshigaya Inaba no kami, one of the governors of Miako, to seize the\r\nfollowing persons: Ee kai kitchi, the gentleman in charge of Mito’s\r\nhouse in Miako, and his son; three gentlemen, retainers in the service\r\nof the Kwanbakku Takatskasa dono, and the son of one of them, and a\r\nteacher of Chinese in Miako; Matzdaira Tanba no kami, a Daimio, related\r\nby marriage to Satsuma. His territory was taken from him and given to\r\na child (Matzdaira Toki no skay). This child’s followers were, after\r\nthe Regent’s death, put in charge of the British Legation at Tozenji;\r\nalso a retainer of this Daimio and his secretary. These were all seized\r\nby order of the Regent, and sent to Yedo for trial before the Jeesha\r\nboonyo, the judges in the Hio jo sho.\r\n\r\nIn the 1st month of the following year--_i.e._, about March,\r\n1859--several of the gentlemen about the court in the service of the\r\nmembers of the imperial family and others of very high rank were\r\narrested. Three of these were retainers of Sanjio dono, of Arisungawa\r\nmia, and of Saiwonji dono respectively. Two retainers of the nephew\r\nof the Emperor, the Buddhist high-priest and the secretary of the\r\nKwanbakku, were ordered to be sent up to Yedo. Within two months after\r\nthis, seven high Koongays and four ladies, with seventeen more of the\r\npersons about the court, were all sent to Yedo by orders of Ee Kamong\r\nno kami.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, on the 2d day, 2d month, Itakura Suwo no kami, one of the\r\nJeesha boonyo (temple lords acting as judges) was degraded. His crime\r\nwas, that, being judge in rotation in the Hio jo sho in Yedo when these\r\nprisoners were brought before him, he would not bring them in guilty\r\nof anything, as he did not fear the Regent, and he had been requested\r\nsecretly by the Emperor not to gratify him. At the same time Tsuchiya,\r\ngovernor of Osaka, was degraded and removed. He was an illegitimate son\r\nof Mito.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858, before these strong measures had been taken by\r\nthe Regent, Mito had written to the Emperor in the 8th month to the\r\nfollowing effect: “Your revenue is not large enough, which is the cause\r\nof much sorrow to me. Permit me to present you with a few kobangs; and\r\nif it is in your power, please give to the Kwanbakku Koozio dono some\r\nadditional land, and all the Koongays and those about the court who\r\nhave titles [I give?] 20,000 kobangs among them; and as Hirohashi is\r\nvery diligent and able, I present him with silver.”\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that with the system of espionage so perfected as it\r\nis in Japan, the Regent would soon find out that Mito was intriguing\r\nat Miako, and probably got a copy of this letter before he gave orders\r\nto seize the persons above named, who were all implicated in these\r\nintrigues against him.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858, in the 8th month, the Shiogoon (or the Regent more\r\ntruly) sent three Daimios as envoys to Mito, with a letter to the\r\nfollowing effect:\r\n\r\n“You, Mito, formerly were anxious to assist Japan in her troubles, and\r\nyour reasons for so doing were very good. But the Shiogoon does not\r\napprove of your recent conduct.” (Mito had written to the Emperor, with\r\nwhom he was connected by marriage, to complain of the boy from the Kii\r\nfamily having been made Shiogoon, on the ground of his being too young\r\nfor the office, but in reality to get his own son appointed by the\r\nEmperor to the place.) “You have spoken to the Emperor too much about\r\nthe adopted son of Kii. Further, you have sent letters to the Koongays\r\nand members of the imperial family to gain them over to your views;\r\nand you, a man of rank, have not scrupled to use low men [Ronins] to\r\ncarry letters to Miako, inveighing against the government of Yedo.\r\nFrom these acts of yours great confusion has arisen. The Emperor has\r\nwritten a letter to the Shiogoon, and low men have been used as the\r\nbearers [? to insult the Yedo government]. You have tried to stir up a\r\nquarrel between the Emperor and the Kubosama, and have excited discord\r\namong the Koongays. It is a most improper thing for you thus to be\r\nacting behind our back, and in the dark.” (Mito had sent many letters\r\nto the Fudai Daimios and Yakonins to gain them over to the side of\r\nStotsbashi.) “You must suffer a severe punishment. But as it is now the\r\ntime of Hoji” (_i.e._, the canonization of the late Shiogoon), “we are\r\nwilling to view your crime with leniency. Your punishment is, that you\r\nbe henceforth imprisoned in your room [cheekio]. This letter I intrust\r\nto the care of your son, to be delivered to you.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time a letter was sent to Mito’s son and heir, of tenor as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Your father has been carrying on secret intrigues at Miako. He has\r\nsent many of his servants there upon highly important missions. But\r\nall his intrigues have been against the Shiogoon secretly, and, as\r\nit were, behind his back. The ways of father and son” (_i.e._, the\r\nson cannot help what his father does) “are different, but I think you\r\nmay follow a better way than your father. If you have no better way,\r\nyou must send guards to keep your father, and prevent his carrying on\r\nthese intrigues. The crime of putting himself in opposition to the\r\nShiogoon is very great, and merits severe punishment. But you side with\r\nyour father, and it is natural for you to do so from filial obedience.\r\nBut for this crime your father must be removed from his position and\r\nterritory.”\r\n\r\nOn the 27th day of the 8th month a letter was sent to the principal\r\none of the retainers, the Karo, or minister of Mito. “Your master has\r\nbeen engaged in very dangerous schemes and intrigues, of which you were\r\nignorant.” (Mito had written a letter to say that all the Daimios gave\r\nthemselves up to trifling and debauchery.) “You were very foolish if\r\nyou did not know of this business, and you ought on that account to be\r\nseverely punished. But as Mito, your master, said that this business in\r\nwhich he was engaged was entirely for the good of the empire of Japan,\r\nand of the greatest consequence, your punishment shall be mitigated. In\r\nfuture you will take care to look into what your master is doing, and\r\nnot cause the government of the Shiogoon so much trouble.\r\n\r\n“In future, if you do cause trouble, you shall be severely punished.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared that both parties were trying to gain over the Kwanbakku by\r\nbribes--the Regent on the one hand, and Mito on the other. This high\r\nofficer was perplexed which to side with, but he concealed all from the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon commanded a letter to be written to Mito, to inform him\r\nthat government was aware that many men had come secretly to Yedo from\r\nMito, and warning him of what would be the consequence if any trouble\r\nshould arise; and at the same time eight Daimios were appointed to\r\nguard the approaches to the city.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Regent was maturing his plans, and having arrested\r\nmany of the agents of Mito, brought them before the Hio jo sho and\r\njudges of Yedo. The personal enmity of the two was working for the\r\nopening up of the country to foreign trade.\r\n\r\nMany persons, some of whom were connected with the highest officers in\r\nMiako and Yedo, were arrested as being engaged with Mito in intrigues.\r\nThe head retainer of Mito was kept in confinement, and was commanded to\r\nkill himself in prison:[10] Eekai, the gentleman in charge of Mito’s\r\nhouse in Miako, with his third son, the head chamberlain of Mito’s\r\nestablishment, the gentleman in the service of the late Kwanbakku, the\r\nChinese teacher, and a lady about the establishment of Konoyay dono,\r\nin Miako, were brought before the judges in the Hio jio sho Hoki no\r\nkami, and the two city magistrates, Ishingaya and Ikeda.[11] Of the\r\nprisoners, the first three were beheaded.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th month, 20th day, the following letter was sent to Nakayama\r\nBizen no kami, who was a Hattamoto in the service of government,\r\nresident at Mito’s castle to assist him (or to watch him). Officers\r\nwith the same duties reside at the castles of the other two Sankay,\r\nOwarri and Kii:\r\n\r\n“Your house is a very honorable one, and you are a man of talent and\r\nexperience. You ought to attend more correctly to do your duty. Now\r\nyou have been neglecting your duty, while Mito the elder has been\r\nintriguing at Miako against me. You are ignorant of what is going\r\non, and show yourself to be very indolent. This is a harsh mode of\r\nspeaking, but you are still very young. You are hereby ordered to\r\nconsider yourself under arrest, and remain a prisoner in your own room.”\r\n\r\nToki, a colonel of the Household Guards, was degraded from his rank,\r\nand his territory confiscated.\r\n\r\nTo the Sakuji boonyo, Iwase, and to the First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nNangai, it was ordered that their salaries were to be stopped from that\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe same punishment was inflicted upon Kawadsi, the keeper of the West\r\nCastle. To the Kosho, his eldest grandson, it was written:\r\n\r\n“Your grandfather has been guilty of opposing the government, and has\r\nbeen degraded and deprived of his territory, and ordered to confine\r\nhimself to his room. Therefore it is our will that you take possession\r\nof his territory, and also of his office.”\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the Regent’s policy always to put children in\r\nplace of those men whom he displaced.\r\n\r\nThe other keeper of the West Castle was degraded, and deprived both of\r\nhis territory and office.\r\n\r\nTo Tayki no skay, commander of the vanguard of the army, son of Oodo,\r\nit was written: “Having examined into the offense of your father, I\r\nhave degraded him; but you are his adopted son, and therefore I give to\r\nyou his territory and house.”\r\n\r\nOf other high officers some were beheaded, while others were ordered\r\nnot to enter a town (Chu tsui ho); others were imprisoned in their own\r\nhouses (Oshi kome), or in prison; others were put in irons; others\r\nconfined to one room for life (ay chikio); others were banished to\r\nsmall islands.\r\n\r\nAll the above, who were themselves persons of some rank, and connected\r\nwith the highest in the empire, were brought to the Hio jo sho, in\r\nYedo, and received their sentences from the temple lords sitting there.\r\n\r\nTo Hongo Tango no kami, at that time in the Lower Cabinet, the Shiogoon\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n“Your conduct recently has been very improper. The Shiogoon has heard\r\nof this, and you deserve to be severely punished; but I will be\r\nlenient, and only deprive you of 5,000 koku of revenue, and degrade\r\nyou.” (He had been made a Daimio, with 10,000 koku of revenue, by the\r\nprevious Shiogoon.) To his son the Shiogoon wrote as above, but added:\r\n“I will now take the ground I took from your father, reducing him from\r\na Daimio to a Hattamoto. Your father must stay in his house, and retire\r\nfrom public life, and give over his lands and rank to you.”\r\n\r\nTo Ishikawa Tosa no kami a similar letter was written, depriving him of\r\nhis honors and territory, which were given to his son.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Treasury, Sassaki Sinano no kami, was degraded.\r\n\r\nIyo no ske, a gentleman in the service of Mito, was transported to\r\nHatchi jio. His son, being only three years of age, is to be kept till\r\nhe is fifteen, and then transported also.\r\n\r\nTwo boys, aged four and two years, sons of Mito’s chamberlain, are to\r\nbe expelled from towns when they arrive at fifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nThe Regent, after thus disposing of his enemies, proceeded, in the name\r\nof the Shiogoon, to reward his friends.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Matzdaira Idzumi no kami, then the head of the Cabinet: “I\r\napprove of what you have done, and in testimony I give you twenty-five\r\nobangs. [An obang is a large gold coin worth about thirty-five\r\ndollars.] You have been very diligent in a most difficult and important\r\nbusiness. I am very much satisfied, and will change your territory; and\r\nas that you now possess is very poor, I will give you better.” (He also\r\nsent him a sword.)\r\n\r\nTo the temple lord, Matzdaira Hoki no kami, were given a saddle and six\r\ndresses.\r\n\r\nTo the Owo metski Kowongai were given seven obangs and four dresses.\r\n\r\nTo the street governor of Yedo, Ikeda, were given seven obangs and five\r\ndresses.\r\n\r\nTo the second street governor, Ishi ngaya, ten obangs and five dresses.\r\n\r\nTo the treasurer, five obangs and three dresses.\r\n\r\nThese men had acted as the judges in the Hio jo sho, and had awarded\r\nthe punishments to the accused. Itakura was degraded because he would\r\nnot act as the tool of the Regent in executing his vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to these officers the Shiogoon expresses satisfaction with\r\nthe diligence shown by them, and on that account rewards them, at the\r\nsame time rewarding smaller officers who have been similarly engaged,\r\nbut without specifying them by name.\r\n\r\nTo Manabay, who had been formerly Prime Minister, and lately much\r\nengaged in ferreting out these intrigues for the Regent, the Shiogoon\r\nwrote: “You are now not very strong, and it will be perhaps better that\r\nyou retire from the weight of public duty.”\r\n\r\nThe Regent and he had a difference as to whether he was right in,\r\nor had the power of, punishing these men. The Regent was anxious\r\nto get rid of him, but his arguments were strong, and, besides, he\r\nwas cognizant of all the secrets of the late _coup d’etat_, so that\r\nthe Regent dared not take a stronger step than simply advise him to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\nThe Regent must have been well aware that in acting as he was doing\r\nhe was playing a dangerous game. He had not been afraid to enter the\r\nfamily of the Emperor himself. The servants of the highest Koongays\r\nhad been arrested, and themselves insulted and degraded. He had\r\ndegraded five of the highest Daimios--Owarri, Mito, Satsuma, Tosa, and\r\nEtsizen--and had severely punished all of lower rank who had in any\r\nway countenanced or assisted those opposed to him. He had put his own\r\nprotégé on the seat of the Shiogoon, in opposition to Stotsbashi, the\r\nnominee of Mito. He now felt that he must retain the reins of power in\r\nhis own hands, as, if he yielded a jot, his enemies would overthrow\r\nhim, and take away his place and name. The only thing he had now to\r\nfear was secret enemies, who might wreak their vengeance by poison or\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nThe 3d day of the 3d month is a day when a great levee is held at the\r\ncastle in Yedo, all the Daimios on duty appearing in court dresses,\r\nwith large retinues. At such times it is common for strangers to\r\ngather on the broad road or esplanade by the side of the castle moat,\r\nto watch the trains of the Daimios going to and returning from court.\r\nThey often carry with them the small monthly list of officials in which\r\nthe armorial bearings are given, by which the train of each Daimio may\r\nbe at once recognized. In the Daimios’ quarter of the city the guards\r\nof the streets and cross streets are the retainers of Daimios. The\r\nguard-houses are sometimes divided into two when the guard is divided\r\nbetween two neighboring Daimios. Upon days of levee such as this\r\nstrangers are allowed to loiter about, and are not so readily noticed\r\nas at other times.\r\n\r\nAt the south side of the castle of Yedo is the Soto Sakurada, or\r\nouter Cherry gate, opening from that part of the inclosure in which\r\nthe residences of the Gorochiu are situated. At this gate the moat is\r\ncrossed by a bridge which opens upon a wide graveled road--the Tatsu no\r\nkutchi--bounded on the one side by the moat, on the other by Daimios’\r\nresidences, and leading by a gentle ascent to the residence of the\r\nRegent, Ee Kamong no kami.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of the 3d month the Shiogoon was to hold this levee, at\r\nwhich the Regent, now that he had put down his enemies, would appear in\r\nthe plenitude of his power as the real ruler of Japan. He set out in\r\nhis norimono toward the Sakurada gate, which was at a short distance,\r\nand seen from the door of his own residence. He was surrounded by his\r\nown retinue in white dresses. Suddenly a rush of men was made at the\r\ntrain. The bearers set down the norimono. Men with drawn swords ordered\r\nhim to come out. He expostulated. One fired a pistol through the chair,\r\nwounding him in the back. He tried to crawl out, but his head was\r\nimmediately cut off and carried away by the assassins.\r\n\r\nThe investigation which follows will show what took place.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of the 3d month (March 24, 1860) the Gorochiu wrote to\r\nthe commander of the guard kept by Matzdaira Segami no kami: “Why did\r\nyou allow men in disguise, with small sleeves and drawn swords, to pass\r\nyour guard and loiter about the Tatsu no kutchi?” To this a reply was\r\ngiven: “There was a heavy fall of snow at the time. I noticed the men\r\nonce, and they disappeared; but I acknowledge my fault--I am much to\r\nblame in the matter. But what shall I do now? Shall I cut off my men’s\r\nheads?”\r\n\r\nThe same question was put to Matzdaira Daizen no daibu’s (Choshiu)\r\nguard, who kept the Sakurada gate. He answered: “This morning at nine\r\no’clock many men passed, but whether they were porters or soldiers I\r\ncannot tell. Several passed with blood-stained swords in their hands. I\r\nwas on the point of arresting them, but as there was much snow falling\r\nI could not see them distinctly, or where they went to.”\r\n\r\nThe principal gentleman in the late Regent’s service, Kimatta Watari,\r\nwrote to the Gorochiu as follows: “This morning, while my master was\r\non his way to the shiro to pay his respects to the Shiogoon, an attack\r\nwas made upon his train. In the scuffle one man was killed, and the\r\nservants of Ee brought the body to the house here.”\r\n\r\nIt is a general impression in Yedo that the servants, or some of them,\r\nas well as the guards about, and even some of the Daimios living in the\r\nneighborhood, were cognizant of the attack about to be made. Some of\r\nthem gave no assistance to their master.\r\n\r\nThe same day the Shiogoon sent two Katchi metsuki to Ee Kamong no\r\nkami’s house to make inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe servants of Sakkai oota no kami, guards of the Owo tay, a large\r\ngate of the castle, wrote a similar letter to the above. It is a common\r\nplan in Japan, even among Daimios, when an investigation is to be made\r\nin which many are concerned, for all to write similar letters, to\r\nprevent the government seizing one. They added: “One Ronin, between\r\ntwenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age, cut his throat. He only had\r\nhis sword-sheath when found, and no sword. We found one wounded by a\r\nshot, and seized him.”\r\n\r\nAt Tatsu no kutchi, the men at the cross-street guard-house, occupied\r\nby Tajima no kami and Sakkai oota no kami, said to the Gorochiu: “At\r\nabout eight o’clock this morning a man shot himself through the neck\r\nwhile holding a man’s head in his hand. Immediately one of the guard\r\nsaid, ‘I will ask the man where he came from.’ He said he was a servant\r\nof Satsuma. We sent for a surgeon, and he is now under treatment.”\r\n\r\nEe Kamong no kami writes himself to the Shiogoon (notwithstanding his\r\nhaving had his head removed several hours previous): “I proposed going\r\nto the levee at the palace, and was on my way there, when near the\r\nSakurada gate, and in front of the joint guard of Matzdaira Osumi no\r\nkami and Ooyay Soongi, about twenty men were collected. They began to\r\nfire pistols, and afterward with swords attacked me in my norimono. My\r\nservants thereupon resisted, and killed one of the men--the others ran\r\noff and escaped. I having received several wounds, could not pay my\r\nintended visit to the Shiogoon, and was obliged to return to my house,\r\nand now I send the names of such of my servants as were wounded.”\r\n\r\nOf these there were in all nineteen, of which number several died.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving intelligence of this attack, the Shiogoon sent to the\r\nRegent a present of ginseng root, and to inquire more particularly as\r\nto his health and condition.\r\n\r\nUpon the coats which were left by the assassins pieces of poetry had\r\nbeen worked with the needle; such as, “Let us take and hoist the\r\nsilken standard of Japan, and first go and fight the battles of the\r\nEmperor.” Upon another was the following: “My corpse may dry up with\r\nthe flowers of the cherry, but how can the spirit of Japan relax?”\r\n\r\nThe names of eighteen men are given who were engaged in the\r\nassassination of the Regent. Of these--\r\n\r\nArimura Jesayay mong, who is said to have been the actual perpetrator\r\nof the deed, was head servant of Satsuma.--His brother is probably the\r\nman who assassinated Mr. Richardson in 1862.\r\n\r\nSanno take no ske, a servant of Mito.\r\n\r\nSeito Kemmootz.\r\n\r\nThese three, with two others, are said to have died of the wounds\r\nreceived, on the 7th day of the 3d month, or four days after his death.\r\nSakkai and Yakushuri, on the part of the Shiogoon, sent a letter to Ee\r\nKamong no kami, to ask how he was, and to bestow upon him a present of\r\nfish and sugar, as a mark of regard.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet was in difficulty how to act. They were of the party of the\r\nRegent, but were now afraid that the opposite views would prevail, and\r\nthat power would fall into the hands of Mito.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Gorochiu, Neito Kii no kami wrote to the servants of\r\nEe Kamong no kami:\r\n\r\n“As a severe misfortune has befallen Ee Kamong no kami, all his\r\nservants and relations are liable to be implicated in the trouble.[12]\r\nIf you, in revenge, should raise disturbance with the followers of\r\nMito, it will occasion much trouble. I will endeavor to arrange matters\r\nfor you, and keep things quiet.”\r\n\r\nFor some time after the assassination, the gates of the Shiogoon’s\r\ncastle, known as the Sakurada, Babasaki, and Watakura, were shut. The\r\nTayass gate at Take bashi, the Hanzo and Saymidzu gates, were open\r\nduring the day and shut at night.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet were allowed a guard of sixty men, and those\r\nof the lower Cabinet fifty men.\r\n\r\nThe men now feared by the government, the partisans of Mito, were\r\nlurking about Yedo in numbers. It was known that the head of the Regent\r\nhad been carried off to the city of Mito and put up on a pole, with\r\nmuch abusive writing attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon gave orders to five Daimios to arrest all suspicious\r\npersons from Mito, and to seize the leaders of the movement.\r\n\r\nMito had said, tauntingly, “How can I, a poor Daimio, arrest these men,\r\nwhen you, the Shiogoon, are not able to do so? If you wish to seize\r\nthese men, send your officers and do it. From Tatsuno kootchi a head\r\nwas brought, and Ee Kamong no kami’s servants are very anxious to get\r\npossession of it.”\r\n\r\nThe head of the Cabinet, Neito, wrote to Matzdaira Osumi no kami:\r\n“Three days ago a high officer was assassinated before your door. You\r\ndid not go to his assistance, or prevent the outrage. You were very\r\nnegligent of your duty, and you are to be punished by the door of your\r\nresidence being shut for one week, and you are not to go out during\r\nthat time, but to confine yourself to your own house.”\r\n\r\nA similar message was sent to Katagiri Iwami no kami, keeper of the\r\nHeebiyah gate; and also to Toda stchi no ske (a child), keeper of the\r\nBabasaki gate.\r\n\r\nAt this time the streets of Yedo were placarded with squibs against the\r\nparty of the late Regent and those in favor of foreigners. One of these\r\naccused the late Gotairo of enriching himself by foreign trade at the\r\nexpense of the people of Japan, and others were obscure allusions to\r\nthe founder of the family. Another, by turning the characters of his\r\nname upside down, makes of it, “A gentleman’s head swept away is very\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n(Some of these squibs were what is called “Yabatai” writing. This name\r\nis founded on the following: Abe no naka maro in old times was sent as\r\nembassador to China. The Chinese Emperor was angry with him, and said\r\nthat if he could not read a certain piece of writing he would kill\r\nhim. He failed, and was put to death. Another embassador succeeded, to\r\nwhom the same alternative was given. While he was musing upon it, and\r\npraying to Ten sho go dai jin, a spider dropped from the ceiling upon\r\nthe paper, and went from word to word showing him how it was to be\r\nread. This is called Yabatai, wild-horse writing, now converted into\r\nYaotai, wild-fool writing.)\r\n\r\nThe following information as to the assassins appears to have been\r\ngiven to the Gorochiu by Hossokawa, the Daimio to whose residence\r\nseveral of the assassins fled, saying that they were men from Mito, and\r\nwished to place themselves under his protection. He is supposed to have\r\nknown all about the affair from the first.\r\n\r\nOne of the assassins, Mori, said that, about three months before, he\r\nhad attempted to kill the Regent by shooting him with a pistol. The\r\nball passed through the norimono, and he made his escape. The day they\r\ncame to Hossokawa’s house was very cold, so they were provided with\r\nfood and wine. There was much snow falling, which furthered the designs\r\nof the assassins, as they thought it was assistance given them from\r\nheaven. They were all very tired and sleepy. Upon the 18th day of the\r\n2d month they all went to Mito, afterward returning to Yedo; and they\r\nmet in the morning of the 3d day of the 3d month at Atango yama. They\r\ndid not sleep there; but the Buddhist priest was cognizant of what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nThe government in Yedo had doubtless good cause for alarm at the\r\npresent crisis, as Mito, on the one hand, and the young Ee, son of the\r\nRegent, on the other, were making preparations for a fight. The policy\r\nof Iyeyas in compelling the lords to be personally in Yedo with few\r\nfollowers, while their strength in men remained at their provincial\r\nseats, prevented any outbreak. Mito was gradually filling his houses\r\nin Yedo with men.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the family retainers of the Ee Kamong no kami, the\r\nlad who had succeeded to his father, fearing what might be the result\r\nof the present crisis, brought up ten cannon from his shta yashiki\r\nin the suburbs of Yedo, to his kami yashiki. [Every Daimio of any\r\nwealth has three houses in Yedo: his own residence, kami yashiki,\r\nwhere his wife and family reside, near the castle; naka yashiki, where\r\nconcubines, servants, etc., reside; and shta yashiki, where he has a\r\ngarden, and retainers, servants, and their families reside.] From his\r\nlands at Sano, in the province of Simotsuki, he brought up 400 men.\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which the Regent was killed, an attempt was made\r\nby Ronins of Mito to kill Matzdaira Sanuki no kami, who was a near\r\nrelative of Mito, but a friend and son-in-law of Ee Kamong no kami.\r\nHe had some suspicion, and was unwell on the day of the levee, and\r\nsent his son in his place. The norimono was attacked, but when the\r\nson was dragged out, and they discovered their mistake, the assassins\r\nlet him go. The father did not long escape, however. He had taken as\r\na concubine a girl from Mito, who, during the next month, stabbed him\r\nwhile in bed, and cut off his head, sending it to Mito. Matzdaira\r\nKoonai no tayu, another friend of the Regent’s, and also a relative of\r\nMito, hearing in the palace of the murder of the Regent, escaped by a\r\nback way.\r\n\r\nThe Daimio Hossokawa Etshiu no kami wrote to the government as follows:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday morning some men came to my guards at the main gate, and\r\nsaid they were servants of Mito and had killed the Regent, and it was\r\nright that they should go to the Gorochiu; but as it is the first time\r\nthey have come to Yedo, and do not know where the Gorochiu live, they\r\nrequested me to go with them. I asked them who they were and what they\r\nwanted. They answered, that they had been this morning fighting with\r\nthe Regent at the Sakurada gate; and having first wounded him with a\r\npistol, they pulled him by the right hand out of the kango and cut off\r\nhis head. There came at first only nine men, but these were followed by\r\na number of others: whence they came I do not know.”\r\n\r\nHossokawa accompanied these men to the Hio jo sho, where the judges\r\non duty asked them to give in writing their reasons for killing the\r\nRegent. The answer was: “We have good reasons. From the time of Zin\r\nmu tenwo to the present day the Japanese nation has never received\r\nany insult from a foreign nation; now five foreign nations have made\r\ntreaties, and all through the empire the people are angry and sorry and\r\nvexed, and the Regent did not care. If he does not care for this, he\r\nmakes himself an enemy to the nation, and therefore we killed him. We\r\nhave no other reason.”\r\n\r\nThe officers at the Hio jo sho were afraid to ask any more questions.\r\n\r\nMito sent the following letter to the Shiogoon:\r\n\r\n“I am told that some men who were formerly in my service, but who were\r\ndismissed, have gone this morning to the Sakurada gate and killed Ee\r\nKamong no kami. They appear to have gone to Hossokawa, wishing that\r\nhe should take them into his employ. A messenger from Hossokawa has\r\nbrought me this information. I am very sorry for it, and it has caused\r\nme much distress. I could not employ so many servants, and therefore\r\nwas obliged to reduce my establishment, while some men who would not\r\nobey me went away of their own accord. On this account I am unable\r\nto arrest or punish such men, and must trust to the servants of the\r\nShiogoon doing so, while I must try to find those who have absconded;\r\nbut the Shiogoon is powerful while I am comparatively powerless; I\r\ntherefore beg the assistance of the Shiogoon.”\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon wrote to Mito on the 4th day of the 3d month:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday your servants killed the Gotairo, and now I fear they may\r\nattack and kill some of the Gorochiu. It is ordered that your servants\r\nfrom morning to night, all day and all night, are not to move out of\r\nthe house.”\r\n\r\nOtta, Hiobu sho, wrote to the Shiogoon:\r\n\r\n“This morning about 8 A.M. the men of my guard informed me that two\r\nsoldiers had passed them wounded and covered with blood. They, when\r\nvery near my cross guard, committed suicide. I thereupon sent an\r\nOmetski to investigate the case. I asked the men standing near whence\r\nthey had come. They said from the direction of the Heebiyah gate, and\r\nthat on account of a severe wound of the shoulder one of them was faint\r\nand could not walk. He said to his companion, ‘I cannot kill myself, as\r\nI cannot move my right hand’; the other said, ‘If you are weak I will\r\ndo it for you,’ and cut off his head, and immediately after doing so he\r\ncut his own throat. We found that one of the swords of these men was\r\nbent round like a bow, and on examining the pockets, one had seven boos\r\n[coins], and the other seven boos and a half; and besides the money\r\nwas a crest similar to that used by the Shiogoon [Mito uses the same\r\ncrest--the awoyee, or three leaves], which had been cut from his coat;\r\nand a receipt from the Yebi ya [_i.e._, lobster inn], a tea-house at\r\nthe Yosiwarra [the government brothel]--viz., two boos for Tamanyoshi\r\nand two for Chittosay, two girls; one boo for a singing-girl; one boo\r\nfor drink, two boos for fish, and ten tenpos for rice, with half a boo\r\nas a present to the servants of the house, with the date, 2d month,\r\n27th day.”\r\n\r\nThe street governor came and examined the corpses, and took them away\r\non the 4th day of the 3d month.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of the 3d month--_i.e._, the day after the\r\nassassination--Satsuma wrote to the Shiogoon:\r\n\r\n“A servant of mine, Arimura Yooske, yesterday absconded and has not\r\nyet returned. I find that a man who committed suicide yesterday,\r\nnear the residence of Endo Tajima no kami, was his elder brother. As\r\nI am ignorant of what he has been doing, please to order him to be\r\narrested.”\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of the 3d month the Ronins in the service of Mito who had\r\nassisted in the murder wrote out the following statement and gave it to\r\nHossokawa:\r\n\r\n“We left our province of Hitatsi on the 18th day of last month; we did\r\nnot meet together, but stopped at different parts of the town during\r\nour stay in Yedo. This morning we all met at the temple on Atango Hill\r\n[in the middle of Yedo], and thence we went to the Cherry gate, and\r\nwaited between the guard-house of Osumi no kami and the Cherry gate.\r\nThe Gotairo came along with his retinue. All at once we surrounded the\r\nkango on both sides. For some time we argued with the Gotairo. We told\r\nhim that he was a bad man. We spoke to him about foreigners coming to\r\nthe country, about the export of gold, about his receiving money as\r\nbribes from foreigners. He answered, and his men tried to prevent any\r\nattack being made upon him. One of our men fired a pistol into the\r\nkango (by which shot he was wounded in the back). He crawled out of the\r\nkango, but could not rise off his hands and knees quickly. His servants\r\nran away, and one man cut off his head; six or seven others hacked at\r\nhis body.”\r\n\r\nIn the pocket of Arimura, the servant of Satsuma, who had been killed,\r\nwas found a “sakiburay,” or permit to travel for the Prince of Satsuma,\r\nwho was at this time a child--“My master to-morrow sets out for\r\nSatsuma, and wants at each station coolies and horses.” There was also\r\nfound a piece of poetry:\r\n\r\n  “This is my body, which belongs to my master;\r\n  I will wait in the ground till my name is made greater.”\r\n\r\nThe following is given as information with reference apparently to the\r\nmen who had banded themselves together to free their country from the\r\npresence of foreigners:\r\n\r\n“There are sixty honorable men in the service of Mito who are very hard\r\nand iron-willed. Why are they so iron-willed? To drive away foreigners\r\naccording to the wish of the Emperor expressed in his letter of the\r\n28th day of the 12th month. Mito has received a letter from the\r\nEmperor. Hikonay [_i.e._, the Regent, from the name of his castle] gave\r\nit to him to tell him he must go to Miako. We have got the Emperor’s\r\nletter and know his wishes [that foreigners should be driven out of\r\nJapan], and if we do not obey him we are rebels. The will of the\r\nEmperor we are determined to accomplish.”\r\n\r\nAs further information the following is given: Hotta Bitshiu no kami\r\nwent to Miako on the part of the Gotairo to speak to the Emperor\r\nabout the foreign treaties with Japan. The Emperor said to him: “You\r\nhave made your treaties first, and afterward come to me to tell me of\r\nwhat you have done. I know nothing about it. I know nothing about the\r\nbusiness transacted in Kwanto--_i.e._, in Yedo.” Hotta could not answer\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Regent then sent Manabay to Miako to speak to the Emperor. He had\r\nan audience of the Emperor, and advised him to wipe out the treaty\r\nmade at Yedo, and to make an entirely new and proper one. The Emperor\r\nreplied: “You have fouled my face, and consider me as of no use. From\r\nthe beginning there was always an Emperor in Japan; but if now the\r\npeople do not wish it, I will give up my position. But you are trying\r\nto sow divisions between the Emperor and the Shiogoon.”\r\n\r\nManabay said: “It will be better for us to make their interests one\r\n[alluding to the proposal that the Shiogoon should marry the sister\r\nof the Emperor]. If we do so, we can afterward unite to brush out\r\nforeigners.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor replied: “Now, at three or four audiences you have brought\r\nforward the business of Kwanto, but each time it has been false. Now\r\nyou speak truth. If you think it right, put out these foreigners now.\r\nBut my honor has been fouled and broken.”\r\n\r\nManabay said: “At present the government of Japan is difficult and in a\r\ncritical position, but let us be quiet and delay.”\r\n\r\nManabay had, for the Regent, given large sums of money to the high\r\nKoongays, the Kwanbakku, and others, to bring over the Emperor to his\r\nside. The Emperor was then standing alone, the Kwanbakku having been\r\nbought over. Manabay, on his return, retired from the Gorochiu to his\r\nprovincial residence in Etsizen, but he got the credit of having saved\r\nJapan at this critical period from a civil war. It was only postponed\r\nfor a little.\r\n\r\nThe Gorochiu were in great alarm at this time, and issued orders to all\r\nthe guards around and in Yedo to be on the watch for disturbances.\r\n\r\nAt the Hio jo sho the following evidence was elicited from one of the\r\nguards:\r\n\r\n“I am a Gay zammi.[13] In the open space in front of the gate there\r\nwere eight or nine men standing--some with raincoats on, and some\r\nholding umbrellas--and looking at the Sode bookang.[14] I heard a\r\npistol-shot in the open space in front, and several shots were fired at\r\nthe kango. The bearers ran away. Some men then seized Ee Kamong no kami\r\nby the mangay [_i.e._, the stiff tuft of hair on the top of the head],\r\nand dragged him out of the kango. After that I heard loud speaking,\r\nquarreling and scolding; and soon after they cut off Ee’s head. While\r\nthe quarreling was going on he was not dead, because I saw him moving\r\nhis hands. Afterward many of the assassins stamped upon the body, and\r\nall kicked it; and they afterward hacked the body all over. They then\r\nall ran away.”\r\n\r\nThe Gorochiu immediately sent a letter to the Emperor: “This morning\r\n(3d day of 3d month), on the Soto Sakurada, twenty servants of Mito\r\nassassinated Kamong no kami. We fear that Mito may have a design of\r\nsending men down to Miako to seize the Emperor, and gain over the\r\nKoongays. Therefore his Majesty’s government would do well to keep a\r\nstrict watch round Miako, and in the six roads leading to the capital.”\r\n\r\nMatzdaira Higo no kami wrote to the Gorochiu: “This morning there was a\r\nserious disturbance at Soto Sakurada. My soldiers are at your disposal\r\nto guard any spot where you may please to order them.”\r\n\r\nThe Gorochiu answered, by the usual way of attaching a small slip of\r\npaper to the letter: “We do not require any more soldiers.”\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon ordered Sakkai Sayay mon no jo, who was now, by the death\r\nof the Regent, head of the Tay kan no ma, or room of the Fudai Daimios,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“This morning there was a great disturbance in Soto Sakurada; and\r\nafterward there was fighting close to the Shiogoon’s residence. You\r\nmust keep all the soldiers under your command in readiness within your\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon also wrote to Higo no kami: “You say you have your\r\nsoldiers all ready for any duty they may be called to. Your loyalty has\r\ngiven me much satisfaction.”\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of the 3d month, Okamoto and Soma, the two principal\r\nofficers in the late Regent’s service, went to the Gorochiu with the\r\nfollowing letter: “Our master, Kamong no kami, went out yesterday to\r\ngo to the castle to pay his respects. When about half-way between\r\nhis house and the gate of the castle, several miscreants fell upon\r\nhim and killed him. We have certain information that these assassins\r\nwere servants of Mito and Satsuma. Yesterday all the officers say\r\nto us, ‘Wait a little.’ But this business cannot wait. We wish to\r\nknow for what reason these men killed our master. There are, at the\r\npresent moment, some of these men secreted in the houses of Wakisaka\r\nand Hossokawa--two Daimios. We wish to see them, and ascertain from\r\nthemselves why they killed our master. We desire that these men may be\r\ndelivered up to us. All the people of Hikonay [the Regent’s territory]\r\nwish this, and we trust you will take pity on them and grant their\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\nTo this letter the Gorochiu affixed as answer: “Cannot do so.”\r\n\r\nThe following letter was addressed to the Shiogoon by the son and\r\nservants of the late Regent on the day of the murder. It was written\r\nto ascertain whether the law of Japan would be acted upon in their\r\ncase, by which the territory of any officer who had been assassinated\r\nis confiscated. “3d day, 3d month.--Ee Kamong no kami, when going to\r\nthe castle to-day, and when near the Sakurada gate, was attacked by a\r\nnumber of villains. At the time, so much snow was falling as to make\r\nit impossible to see a yard before one. All the servants of Ee are\r\nenraged. There were but few Ronins and many servants, and they ought\r\nto have overpowered the Ronins. The servants are deeply shamed when\r\nthey think of Ee nawo massa (the first of the family in the time of\r\nIyeyas). Whatever is to become of us we care not; but the retainers and\r\nfriends of Ee wish to know whether the house is, according to the old\r\nlaws of the empire, to be reduced in rank and impoverished, or if it\r\nis to be entirely degraded and removed from the territory. We wish to\r\nunderstand clearly.” This was written in the name of the young Ee; and\r\nwas probably written with the view of preparing to defend themselves\r\nand party by an appeal to arms rather than by submission.\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon answered to this: “All your father’s territory I restore\r\nto you his son.”\r\n\r\nHere terminates the native account of the assassination. It gives some\r\ninsight into the working of the government, and the unscrupulous means\r\nto which the highest magnates of the land will resort to attain their\r\nends. From the general tenor of the statements, the extreme hatred\r\nof one party in Japan to foreign intercourse is brought out, and the\r\nslight which the Emperor considered to have been put upon him by the\r\nconclusion of the treaty without his consent and against his expressed\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nAssassination is the _ultima ratio_ of the desperation of party\r\nweakness. The act implies that the party which has sanctioned it has no\r\none competent to cope with the individual removed, or to fill the place\r\nwhich it has made vacant.\r\n\r\nThe position of the government upon the death of the Regent was that\r\nof helpless inactivity. The sudden removal of the foremost man of the\r\nempire was as the removal of the fly-wheel from a piece of complicated\r\nmachinery. The whole empire stood aghast, expecting and fearing some\r\ngreat political convulsion. The whole country knew who had been the\r\nactive agents in the deed; and perhaps there were at heart very few who\r\ndid not feel more or less satisfaction at the blow given to the party\r\nwhich was responsible for, and instrumental in, bringing foreigners\r\ninto the country; and a civil war or revolution would certainly have\r\nfollowed, had not every one felt that they were, for the first time in\r\ntheir history, face to face with an enemy, fear of whom concentrated\r\nall minor feelings, and consolidated them into one great national\r\ndetermination to rid the land of the hated foreigners. This was the one\r\npolicy which the Emperor demanded of the Shiogoon, which the people\r\nlooked to the government to effect, and which the lords and military\r\nclasses burned to carry into execution. Were the foreigners not a mere\r\nhandful of men, and were such to be allowed to beard and insult the\r\nhighest personages in the land with perfect impunity? Now, when the\r\nhead of the party, who was or pretended to be in favor of such a change\r\nof the laws, is struck down, if some representative of the national\r\nfeelings would only arise and lead them on, they would follow to the\r\ndeath in such a glorious cause. But no such leader appeared. Where was\r\nMito, the rival of the late Regent? and why did he not come forward to\r\ncarry out his own policy at this juncture? The son of the late Regent\r\nwas too young and inexperienced to claim his father’s office, or to\r\nassume the leadership of the party. It was the personal hatred of the\r\ntwo men which had been the moving spring in the daring action of the\r\nRegent, and in the underhand plotting of Mito. In all probability\r\nthe feelings of hostility with which each regarded the foreigner were\r\nequally strong. Mito said you must admit foreigners, because you cannot\r\nkeep them out. He thought we can admit foreigners, and, if we see fit,\r\nafterward turn them out. But Mito was disliked by the other Daimios,\r\nand his name was not sufficient to rally a strong party, while he[15]\r\nand the lately degraded Daimios were now in arrest in their own houses,\r\nin territories which had been transferred to the hands of infants.\r\nThey had thus no opportunity for intriguing, having no common place\r\nof meeting out of Yedo, as by law they were prohibited from going to\r\nMiako, and could only come to Yedo as Daimios, when called there on\r\nduty by the government.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis the only course for the Cabinet to pursue was to go on\r\nquietly, managing the routine of affairs until time should open up some\r\nline of action. The Gorochiu, therefore, with Neito at its head, and\r\nnominally under Tayass as Regent, continued to carry on the ordinary\r\nduties of government.\r\n\r\nEvents have shown that the Regent was right in his judgment of the men\r\nwhom he sought to remove from his path as obstacles--Mito, Etsizen,\r\nSatsuma, Owarri--as these have all since his death reappeared as\r\nleaders of the party opposed to his policy in the Obiroma or council of\r\nthe Kokushu. Etsizen, afterward known by his retired title Shoongaku,\r\nwas the first among these magnates who attempted to take a lead in the\r\ngovernment of Yedo. He had been removed from his position as Daimio\r\nand placed in arrest; but, having subsequently been released, was able\r\nto move about and obtain an influence in high places. He obtained from\r\nthe Emperor a letter [afterward considered a forgery], appointing him\r\nand Awa to fill the place of co-regents, under the name of Sosai Shoku\r\nor Sodangeite. But the fermentation of revolution had already begun\r\nto work, and at such a time the first actors upon the stage seldom\r\nplay the prominent parts they deem themselves fitted to fill. They\r\ngenerally fail to see the causes of the boiling going on around. Such\r\na man is like an atom in a pot of boiling water, and knows and sees\r\nnothing of the fire which is causing all the upturning around him. To\r\neven a superficial looker-on at the state of things in Japan, it was\r\nevident that such a dual condition of government as that then existing\r\ncould not long continue to carry on foreign relations. The discord and\r\nweakness arising from the permission of an _imperium in imperio_ by\r\nthe exterritoriality clause was greatly increased by the government\r\nattempting to carry on foreign relations without the consent or against\r\nthe will of the higher power in Miako. The two powers must work\r\nharmoniously; and so long as the internal affairs of the empire are\r\nthe only possible cause of rupture, the weaker, though more exalted,\r\nwill find it to be its interest to be on good terms with the lower\r\nbut more powerful, the executive. So soon as the latter begins to act\r\nas supreme power toward other nations, it places itself in a wrong\r\nposition, and foreign nations will not treat with such a pretense.\r\nThe opposition finds a head in the Emperor, and the only way to avert\r\na rupture is for the lower power to give way and to act only as the\r\nrepresentative of the head of the empire. If he fails to see this, he\r\nsets himself against the Emperor, who is then supported, not only by\r\nhis own nobility, but also by those powers with whom he has entered\r\ninto relations. The party of the Shiogoon deserts him, and his only\r\n_rôle_ is to work with and under the Emperor; or, if he refuses to do\r\nthis, civil war ensues, and he falls.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of the Gotairo, the Cabinet was able or permitted\r\nto carry on the affairs of State. But while everything seemed smooth,\r\nsmoldering powers were at work preparing for volcanic action. The\r\nKokushu, and especially those who came to Yedo from the west, were\r\nbecoming very much irritated about the question of foreigners in the\r\ncountry, and foreign ministers in Yedo. The latter assumed a position\r\nof superiority to which these lords were quite unaccustomed. They were\r\noccupying temples belonging to great families, situated in cemeteries\r\nconsecrated by the burial of their ancestors and relatives, but now\r\npolluted by intruders hateful to the spirits of the country. The\r\nforeign merchants were able to beard these princes on the highroad,\r\nand to treat with nonchalance dignitaries who looked for the utmost\r\ndeference, and who were authorized by law to punish at their own hands\r\nany real or supposed insolence or insult. On the other hand, they saw\r\ntrade pushing its way in the country; silk which had been sold for 100\r\ndollars was now bringing 1,000, and Emperor and lord longed to share in\r\nsuch advantages and participate in the profits. The first object which\r\nthe more powerful of the Kokushu set themselves to accomplish was to\r\nbreak down this intolerable subjection to the Yedo government. This\r\nwas not difficult to do, as the power of the empire was in the hands\r\nof a delicate lad, and the Emperor, through whom the end was brought\r\nabout, was promised and hoped that the power would revert to him. The\r\nagents in this act were Shoongaku, Shimadzu saburo, Choshiu, and a\r\nKoongay Ohara--a distant relative and the unexpected successor of a\r\nKoongay, and who had spent his early life hanging about the offices of\r\nYedo. After the boy-Shiogoon had been married to Kadsu mia, sister of\r\nthe Emperor, Shoongaku, who was always full of the most economical if\r\nnot parsimonious views, reduced the retinue and court of the Shiogoon\r\ntill it was brought into contempt with the populace. In October, 1862,\r\nthese potentates produced a letter (forged, as is generally believed)\r\nfrom the Emperor, putting an end to the routine of the Yedo court; and\r\nhaving the power in their own hands, they immediately proclaimed the\r\nedict and carried it into execution. The order was to the effect that\r\nthe higher Daimios were to visit Yedo only once in seven years, and\r\nthat the wives and families of all the Daimios were to live at their\r\nown provincial seats. This removed from Yedo all the luster of the\r\ncourt. At the same time these lords filled up the complement of their\r\ndesign by inducing the Emperor to call most of the higher Daimios who\r\nwere of their own views to Miako. The Mikado was swayed hither and\r\nthither as the one party or the other gained the power in the capital;\r\nand so at one time Kanso, the retired lord of Hizen, had the ear of\r\nthe Emperor in the interest of the Shiogoon, while Choshiu appeared to\r\nhave taken up arms against his sovereign. But he seems all along to\r\nhave acted loyally and patriotically in showing an intense hatred to\r\nthe foreigners who were by force of arms thrusting themselves and their\r\nregiments into the country. This act was the great blow which broke\r\nup the power and brought to a termination the dynasty of Iyeyas. He\r\nhad foreseen and made provision for intestine war and revolution, but\r\nhad not been able to provide for a treaty with foreign nations and an\r\nexterritoriality clause.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the foreign ministers, up to that time resident in Yedo,\r\nretired to Yokohama, and pressed one demand after another upon the\r\nJapanese government, already sufficiently occupied with complications\r\narising from intestine difficulties. The Cabinet was worried by\r\nrequests for interviews upon questions of land, of residences, of money\r\nexchanges, of matters of etiquette in interviews with the Shiogoon,\r\nand other matters which might seem trivial in comparison with the\r\ncrisis through which the country was passing in the face of an internal\r\nrevolution. These foreign ministers were now, somewhat unreasonably,\r\nall demanding that residences should be built for them by the Japanese\r\ngovernment, and insisting that these residences should (in the face of\r\nan article of the treaty to the contrary) be fortified and furnished\r\nwith guns. The recreation ground of the people of Yedo, Go teng\r\nyama, was demanded and given up for this purpose by Ando, then Prime\r\nMinister, and a large building was erected by the Japanese government\r\nupon this site; but the feelings of the people at this unjust\r\nappropriation of a piece of ground which had been set apart for their\r\nuse were so much excited that another local _émeute_ was threatened\r\nat Yedo. This was allayed by the burning of the new building, and by\r\nthe attempted assassination of the Prime Minister, who narrowly escaped\r\nwith the loss of an ear.\r\n\r\nBy these annoyances occurring in the neighborhood of Yedo, and through\r\nthe presence of foreigners, a strong party was drawn over to the views\r\nof the Emperor, and the nation began to see that he had all along been\r\nin the right in opposing the admission of foreigners as detrimental\r\nto the quiet of the country. Satsuma and Choshiu built each a large\r\nnew residence in Miako. The Emperor called on twelve of the wealthiest\r\namong the Daimios to keep each a sufficient body of troops in the city\r\nfor his protection. The young Shiogoon was invited or called upon to\r\npay a visit to Miako when Stotsbashi was intriguing against him. He\r\naccordingly went with Kanso, the retired prince of Hizen, while Higo\r\nwas appointed Shugo shoku, or guardian of the palace. This meeting of\r\nthe Emperor and the Shiogoon seems to have opened the eyes of both to\r\nthe power and intelligence of foreigners, of which the Emperor and his\r\ncourt seem to have been ignorant. Some of the Miako nobility went out\r\non a trip with the Shiogoon in his steamer, and were astonished and\r\nconverted; and Anega Koji was assassinated for expressing too plainly\r\nand openly his opinions as to the power and energy of foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse between the two heads of the empire seems to have\r\nconsolidated the power of the government, and promised to bring forth\r\nfruit in a mutual good understanding and co-operation. Stotsbashi\r\nsneaked away to Yedo in disgrace, and had to run the gantlet of an\r\nattack on his way back, when his chief secretary was assassinated on\r\nthe highroad at Saka no shta. Shimadzu and Choshiu retired from Miako\r\nin disgrace to their respective provincial residences, where they\r\nbrooded over their own position and that of the empire. They could not\r\nbut feel that it was the loyalty of their views which had entailed\r\non them their present disgrace, and the prime cause of this was the\r\nforeigners. They knew well that the feeling of every one of their\r\ncountrymen was with them, and they seem to have at last determined to\r\nthrow themselves into the breach by bringing about a quarrel between\r\nthe government and some foreign nation. Shimadzu, the father of the\r\nDaimio, then a minor, determined to carry out the laws of the country\r\nirrespective of any exterritoriality clauses. On leaving Yedo, on\r\nSeptember 14, 1862, he gave out that he would cut down any foreigners\r\nhe might chance to meet upon the road; when, as he approached Kanagawa,\r\nmeeting three gentlemen and a lady, he ordered his retainers to cut\r\nthem down, and Mr. Richardson, wounded and unable to ride away more\r\nthan two hundred yards, was set upon, fainting from loss of blood, and\r\nbrutally murdered. Justice was asked from the Shiogoon’s government and\r\nthe punishment of the offender, who was well known to all Japan. The\r\nmurder of a merchant by a lord like Satsuma was treated with contempt,\r\nand the matter was referred by the British Minister to H.M. government.\r\nThe subsequent necessary delay of many months, before instructions came\r\nout to demand an indemnity and the punishment of the offender, raised\r\nthe courage of the party opposed to foreigners, and Choshiu determined\r\non his part to carry out the laws of the country according to his\r\ninstructions. He held a commission from the Emperor as guardian of the\r\nStraits of Simo no seki, the narrow western entrance to the “inner\r\nsea.” He had thereby a right to overhaul all vessels passing through\r\nthis strait. There is no other sea quite analogous: it resembles, but\r\nis much narrower than, the Dardanelles, the Sound, the Straits of\r\nDover, or Tarifa, at all of which places some recognition of the power\r\nof the nation to defend a vulnerable point of her territories has been\r\nallowed in the exercise of certain surveillance over passing vessels.\r\nChoshiu fired upon some foreign vessels passing through this strait.\r\nThe consequence of this was a combined attack by English, French\r\nand Dutch, by which he or one of his relatives (by error) suffered\r\nseverely in men, ammunition and prestige. The Shiogoon disavowed his\r\nproceedings, and to satisfy foreign demands proposed to punish the\r\nrebel This, however, he found to be no easy matter, as the whole troops\r\nand populace were in favor of Choshiu and his patriotic attempt, and\r\nthe Shiogoon was at last obliged to make terms with the Daimio.\r\n\r\nChoshiu had presented the following memorial to the government upon\r\nthe position of Japan in its internal and external relations at this\r\njuncture:\r\n\r\n“Allow me, notwithstanding your political discussions [with the\r\nMikado’s envoys], to give you my opinion respecting the troubles\r\nwhich foreigners have given us of late years in asking all kinds of\r\nconcessions, in addition to the unexpected troubles which exist in\r\nour own country. This combination of difficulties within and without,\r\noccurring at the same time, and bringing us to a point when our\r\nprosperity or misfortune is decided, keeps my heart day and night in\r\nanxiety, and induces me to give you in confidence my own feelings upon\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\n“I have long thought that union and concord between the Shiogoon and\r\nMikado, and obedience to the Mikado’s orders, are highly necessary in\r\nkeeping up an intercourse with foreign nations, as I have already said\r\nvery often.\r\n\r\n“But every one knows that since the great council of officers, the\r\nShiogoon and Mikado are disunited, which has occasioned a conflict of\r\nparties, and brought with it discord and trouble.\r\n\r\n“I think the reason of this is, that although the signing of the\r\ntreaties was forced upon us by urgent circumstances and pressing\r\nevents, there are some who maintain that the reopening of relations\r\nwith foreigners has occasioned a degradation of the people, who were\r\nso brave and constant ten years ago, to the state of quiescence and\r\ncowardice to which they are now reduced by their fear of war and of the\r\nforeign powers. These persons who are of this opinion are therefore\r\nin opposition to the acts of the Shiogoon, and say that they will\r\nthemselves undertake to set aside the treaties and prepare the country\r\nfor war, declaring that the Mikado still maintains the old laws of our\r\ncountry, which direct the expulsion of foreigners.\r\n\r\n“Other persons accept, on the contrary, the reopening of the country,\r\nand praise the foreigners, and thus destroy all confidence in\r\nourselves. They say that the foreigners have large forces, and that\r\nthey have great knowledge of arts and sciences.\r\n\r\n“These conflicting opinions trouble the minds of the people. Unity is\r\nforce and strength, and discord is weakness; therefore it would be\r\nimprudent to go to war against powerful and brave enemies with discord\r\nin our minds.\r\n\r\n“The closing or opening of Japan is a matter of the greatest moment.\r\nThat which cannot be shut again should not have been opened, and that\r\nwhich cannot be opened should not have been shut.\r\n\r\n“The closing of Japan will never be a real closing, and the opening\r\nwill never be a real opening, so long as our country is not restored to\r\nits independence, and as long as it is menaced and despised by foreign\r\ncountries. Therefore the opening or closing of Japan is dependent upon\r\nthe restoration of our own powers; if that is effected, then war or\r\npeace can be declared.\r\n\r\n“The condition upon which this power can be restored to us is the\r\nenlightening of the people, and their union.\r\n\r\n“I think the only way to bring about national union is by solid union\r\nbetween the Shiogoon and Mikado, acting together as in one body. Should\r\nthere be war, it can be brought to an end very easily.\r\n\r\n“A time is now come very different from the barbarous ages, and arising\r\nout of the long peace which has prevailed. Every little child knows the\r\nrespect it owes to its parents and masters.\r\n\r\n“It will therefore rejoice everybody in this advanced age to see the\r\nShiogoon hold the Mikado in great respect; and the whole nation would\r\nhonor the Shiogoon, and all troubles would cease, and then only we can\r\nbe restored to our independence and power.\r\n\r\n“After our independence is restored, it is urgent and pressing that we\r\nreform our military institutions, the naval sciences, as well as all\r\nbranches of industry. We should find out the great advancements and\r\ndevelopments of arts and sciences in other countries. The whole nation\r\nmust devote life and soul to the benefit of our state, and we must\r\nlearn and study the interior arrangements of foreign lands, in order\r\nthat the commerce of our country may flourish in this important age. I\r\nthink all this ought to have been done long since; but nothing of the\r\nkind is to be found in the edicts which have appeared so often during\r\nthe last seven years.\r\n\r\n“Inventions and improvements pass on with rapidity, and the time is now\r\ncome to make all these changes and improvements; but if our attachment\r\nto old customs causes us to postpone these measures of such great\r\nimportance, if these changes are later suddenly forced by circumstances\r\nupon the inhabitants, a very bad impression will be produced, creating\r\ndisorder and confusion. These are reasons why they should be effected\r\nnow calmly and gradually. I think that the Mikado will not be\r\ndisinclined to this, and therefore I wish that the Shiogoon should act\r\nunder the orders of the Mikado, and not conclude matters by his own\r\nauthority. He ought to let these designs be known to all the Daimios in\r\nthe name of the Mikado; then there will be a general quiet restored;\r\nthen the dormant soul of the whole nation will awake, and will be\r\nunited in power and in independence; and then it will display its force\r\nand strength to the other five portions of the universe without anxiety\r\nand fear for our own country.\r\n\r\n“I do not write these my sentiments to aid you in your negotiations, as\r\nthey may be of little or no use to you, and only like a drop of water\r\nfalling into the ocean; but to show my gratitude for the favors of the\r\nShiogoon, which my ancestors have enjoyed during centuries.”\r\n\r\nThe aim of the party opposed to the policy of the Shiogoon and the\r\nadmission of foreigners seems to have been to poison the mind of the\r\nEmperor against the young Shiogoon, and to embroil the country in a\r\nwar, by setting the one against the other. The letters from the Emperor\r\nwhich have been obtained prove this.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was conveyed by Shimadzu Saburo from the Emperor\r\nto the Shiogoon about October, 1862:\r\n\r\n“I think that the power of the foreigners [Ee jin, wild men] at the\r\npresent time in the country is improper; and the officers of the Kwanto\r\nseem to have lost all knowledge of the right way, and of all plans of\r\naction, causing disturbance all over the empire. All my people [Ban\r\nnin, 10,000 men] seem about to fall down into mud as black as charcoal.\r\nOn this account I, standing between Ten sho go dai jin and my people,\r\nam very deeply distressed. The Bakuri [Shiogoon’s officers] have spoken\r\nto me, saying, ‘All our people are agitated, and the Shiogoon has no\r\npower to hold up his arm. Therefore please give us your sister in\r\nmarriage [to the Shiogoon]. If you can do this, Miako and Yedo will be\r\nat concord, and the whole power of Japan can join together, and we can\r\nthen brush away the Yee teki’ [_i.e._, foreigners, wild enemies].\r\n\r\n“In answer, I said, ‘This is right, and I will give my sister.’\r\n\r\n“At that time the Bakuri said to me, ‘In ten years the foreigners\r\nmust be brushed away.’ This gave me great pleasure; and I pray to the\r\nspirits every day to help Japan.\r\n\r\n“I have now been waiting for a long time for your brushing away. Why\r\nare you so slow?\r\n\r\n“With my sister Kadsumia I sent Tchikusa shosho and Iwakura chiujo, and\r\nat the same time granted a general amnesty;[16] and all the business of\r\nthe government I gave, as in former times, to the Shiogoon. But this\r\nbusiness about foreigners [Gway-Ee] is of the first importance to the\r\ncountry. Therefore I said, ‘Let all this foreign business come under\r\nmy care, and I will settle it.’ At the time, all the Yedo officials\r\nanswered to me that the Emperor’s proposal was very important and\r\nserious, but a speedy answer cannot be given, and that we must wait a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“After this time, several Daimios proposed several different stratagems\r\nfor driving away foreigners. But of all the Daimios only two--viz.,\r\nSatsuma and Choshiu--came in person to speak to me; and all the loyal\r\npeople from San yodo [west of Miako], Nan kaido [island of Sikok], and\r\nSai kaido [island of Kiusiu], came to Miako like bees, and addressed\r\nme secretly. All these tell me that the officers of Yedo are all bad,\r\nand that they are becoming worse from day to day; and that justice\r\nand truth are fallen to the ground; and that they do not hold the\r\nEmperor in respect; and they are friends of the foreigners, giving them\r\neverything they want--silk, tea, and other things--while the whole\r\ncountry loses. All the people are much vexed about this; and they feel\r\nthat they are becoming the same as servants of the foreigners, and now\r\ntheir habits cannot change. On this account, these people of San yodo,\r\nNan kaido, and Sai kaido, and Satsuma and Mowori [Choshiu], wish to\r\nraise the Emperor’s flag. And they say, that if the Emperor with the\r\nflag goes to Hakonay, the Bakufu [Shiogoon’s office] officers, if bad,\r\nmust all be punished.\r\n\r\n“Some men say that, Japan having been at peace for a long time, the\r\nspirits of the people are very lazy and slow; therefore they suggest\r\nthat a letter should be given to the Daimios and people of the Go ki\r\nstchi do [_i.e._, the districts lying upon the seven roads], ordering\r\nthat foreigners must be brushed out of the country.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor says: ‘Throughout the empire there are many loyal and\r\npatriotic men, therefore I will speak to Satsuma and Nagato to desire\r\nthe people to have patience.’\r\n\r\n“I gave a letter to Koozay Yamato no kami, requesting an answer, and\r\nyet none ever came; and last year I wrote and proclaimed an amnesty,\r\nand to this I received no answer. Why has the Shiogoon thus lost the\r\nway? I believe it is not he, but his officers. All the Gorochiu do not\r\ncare. The Ty jiu [great tree] is but young; but I fear that if I delay\r\nbut an instant [till I can stand up], all the empire will be broken up.\r\nTherefore I am every day troubled and weeping. All the officers of the\r\nKwanto [the Shiogoon, Daimios, etc.] think only of the happiness of\r\na day, and forget the misery of a hundred years. The holy books thus\r\nspeak, and you ought to study them. You ought to keep these virtuous\r\nideas in your minds, and be ready with your military preparations, and\r\nthen you will clearly see your way out, and brush away the power of\r\nthe foreign enemies. But while all Japan is in a state of excitement,\r\nI will hold to the medium course [_i.e._, between brushing away\r\nimmediately and waiting indefinitely]. Since the Tokungawa family\r\nbegan [_i.e._, since Iyeyas], there has not arisen a question of so\r\nmuch difficulty. I have three plans to propose: The first is, that I\r\nwill gradually bring the Shiogoon and Daimios and Hattamoto to Miako,\r\nand will hold a council about the government of the country and the\r\nbrushing away of foreigners. If we can do this, the anger of heaven\r\nand the gods will be averted. They will rejoice, and the good minds of\r\nthe lower classes will return. Then all people will stand on a strong\r\nfoundation, and the empire be as strong as a large mountain.\r\n\r\n“My second plan is, you must lean upon the old laws of Ho taiko\r\n[_i.e._, Taikosama], and give the laws of the country and the\r\nsettlement of the question into the hands of the Tai hang [_i.e._,\r\nlarge fence, or the Kokushiu] and the Gotairo [_i.e._, five elders].\r\nIf we do this, the country can keep out or push back the pressure of\r\nforeigners. All round the coasts military preparations must be made;\r\nand so the country will be strong, and foreigners can be brushed away.\r\n\r\n“My third plan is, to order Stotsbashi to assist the Ty jiu on all\r\ninternal business, and to give the office of Regent to Shoongaku, to\r\ntake charge of the outer relations of the office at Yedo. In that case\r\nboth the internal and external business will be well conducted, and\r\nwe shall not blush to think that we are servants to foreigners, and\r\nthat they have obliged us to cross our coats the right over the left\r\nside.[17] For all men fear that in a very little time these foreigners\r\nwill seize all Japan.\r\n\r\n“I think that these three plans should now be considered and settled,\r\nand to that end I send an envoy to Kwanto; but if they cannot all three\r\nbe carried out, I wish the officers of the Shiogoon to examine them and\r\ndetermine on one that can be carried out. All my servants must be very\r\nbusy going round and round, and there is to be no secrecy about it; but\r\nevery one is to be diligent, and all must give me a faithful report.”\r\n\r\nAt the time this letter was written both Stotsbashi and Shoongaku were\r\nin Miako, whither they had hurried down before the arrival of the\r\nShiogoon. The letter bears some internal evidence of being written at\r\ntheir dictation, especially from the proposal made to appoint the two\r\nas Lieutenants and Regent to or over the Shiogoon; and corroborates the\r\nadvice which Kanso had given the young Shiogoon; viz., that he should\r\nrepair at once to Miako, where the enemies of his power were trying to\r\nsubvert him.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, four Koongays of Miako having been discovered\r\nplotting against the Emperor were degraded and obliged to shave their\r\nheads and retire to monasteries. Koonga and his son, and the Empress\r\nherself, with two concubines, were said to be implicated in these\r\nintrigues. The following reasons of punishment were published: “During\r\nthe last five years intrigues have been carrying on against the Emperor\r\nby the late Gotairo and Sakkye Wakasa no kami. The object of these\r\nintrigues has been to get possession of the Emperor’s person and banish\r\nhim to one of the islands (as formerly several were sent by Ashikanga\r\nand Hojio). Sakkye was very false, and tarnished the bright name of\r\nthe Emperor, which is a very foul crime. Now their devices have been\r\ndiscovered, and the Emperor has ordered the Sisshay [another name of\r\nthe Kwanbakku] thus to punish them.”\r\n\r\nThe punishment inflicted by the British government upon Satsuma at\r\nKagosima, on account of the murder of Mr. Richardson, was severe but\r\ndeserved, and, in a political view, was completely successful. The two\r\nmost powerful lords in the empire had each tried a fall with foreigners\r\nand been worsted. They could no longer press on the government to brush\r\nout these intruders, as they knew now by experience how far behind the\r\ncountry was in military and naval tactics and means of warfare. The\r\nnatural result now followed--they began to quarrel among themselves.\r\nSeeing their own weakness, however, they instantly began to take what\r\nsteps they could to bring themselves up to a higher standing by the\r\neducation of their people, and they began by seeking to acquire a\r\nknowledge of steam and steam-vessels. Choshiu and Satsuma sent young\r\nmen to England, arms and ammunition were purchased, steam-factories\r\nwere erected for working in iron, military tactics were studied,\r\nprofessors were appointed in their colleges, and officers were obtained\r\nto drill their young men and teach the use of the rifle.\r\n\r\nThe fruit expected from the intercourse of the Emperor and Shiogoon\r\nunfortunately did not ripen. The latter returned to Yedo despoiled\r\nof much of the former splendor of his position. His court was broken\r\nup. The greater lords paid now no deference to him, and the lesser\r\nDaimios began to side with the greater. His party consisted chiefly\r\nof the Kamong Daimios, the relatives of the family of Tokungawa. Yedo\r\nitself was falling into the position of a fading capital, and, as a\r\nplace of commercial importance, was dwindling with the departure of its\r\npolitical greatness. A feeble attempt was made to recall the edict and\r\nre-establish the old order of things in Yedo; but events rolled on,\r\nand things are shaping themselves in totally different order from that\r\nproposed by the ruling powers.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Satsuma by the English navy at Kagosima separated that\r\nDaimio from the party of Choshiu and others, and his counsels to\r\nthe Emperor were those of peace. Shimadzu Saburo paid the indemnity\r\ndemanded of him, and gave assurances that the offender should be given\r\nup when discovered, which was perhaps as much as could be expected from\r\none who, while a murder was being committed by his orders, was quietly\r\nsitting within ten feet of his victim.\r\n\r\nThe Shiogoon Iyay mutchi had found nothing but trouble and anxiety from\r\nhis elevation to the seat of power in the year 1859. In 1866 his health\r\nbegan to give way, and he shortly after died, leaving no children, and\r\nthe way became open to his rival, Stotsbashi. The period was critical,\r\nand the ablest man would have found difficulty in steering through the\r\ndangers surrounding the vessel of state. The Daimios would now have\r\nlittle hesitation in withholding their allegiance to another Kubosama\r\nuntil it should be settled who was to be the _de facto_ ruler of the\r\nempire--the Emperor or the Shiogoon. Many would see that some change\r\nmust take place in the internal constitution of the empire now when the\r\ngovernment must deal as one body with foreign nations. The necessity\r\nfor dual government was at an end. The mouthpiece of the nation must\r\nbe one, and give no uncertain sound. The internal resources must be\r\ngathered into one treasury. The police, the taxes, must be recognized\r\nas national, and not as belonging to one petty chief here and there.\r\nThe army and navy required reconstruction; and the power of the feudal\r\nlords would have to be broken down in order to be reconstituted into\r\none strong state under one head.\r\n\r\nThe new Shiogoon, Yoshi hisa, attempted to assume the power with the\r\nposition held by his ancestors, but he was too late. His only true\r\npolicy was to stand beside and support the Emperor while the lower\r\nchiefs impoverished themselves by fighting. He attempted to take a side\r\nagainst the Emperor, but not being aided by a strong party, he was\r\nforced in 1867 to give way, and by abdicating retire into temporary\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nTo add still more to the critical position of affairs in Japan at this\r\ntime, the Emperor died, being about thirty-eight years of age, and\r\nleaving a young boy as his heir and successor. It does not clearly\r\nappear who has been pulling the strings of political action on the\r\npart of the boy-Emperor; but there can be little doubt but that the\r\ntwo Daimios to whom Yedo was the most grievous offense, and whose\r\nancestors had smarted from the rise of the Tokungawa family under\r\nIyeyas, Satsuma and Choshiu, have not been idle. On the other hand, the\r\nwealthy Daimios from the north--Sendai, and other Kamong or relatives\r\nof that family--seemed determined to uphold the position of the family,\r\nand carry out the principles of Iyeyas at all hazards. Between these\r\nparties the Shiogoon, who is said to be an able man, tried to steer a\r\nneutral course until he saw what would turn up. At length he came to\r\nthink that submission to the Emperor was the true policy for himself\r\nand for the empire, and he humbly placed himself at the disposal of\r\nthe Emperor rather than involve the country in another civil war. His\r\nsubmission was accepted by the Emperor in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“The conduct of Tokungawa Yoshi hisa having proceeded to such an\r\nextreme as to be properly called an insult to the whole empire, and\r\nhaving caused the deepest pain to the mind of the Emperor, both sea\r\nand land forces were sent to punish him. Hearing, however, that he is\r\nsincerely penitent, and lives in retirement, the excess of the imperial\r\ncompassion shall be exhausted, and the following commands be enjoined\r\nupon him. Let him be respectfully obedient to them. A period of eleven\r\ndays is granted him in which to comply with all these orders.\r\n\r\n“1st, Yoshi hisa having, on the 12th month of the last year, and\r\nafterward, insulted the Emperor, attacked the imperial city, and fired\r\nupon the imperial flag, was guilty of a most heinous crime. The army\r\nwas accordingly sent out to pursue and punish him. But as he has\r\nmanifested sincere contrition and obedience, has shut himself up in\r\nretirement, and begs that his crime may be pardoned: in consideration\r\nof the no small merit of his family, which, since the time of his\r\nancestors, for more than two hundred years has administered the affairs\r\nof government, and more especially of the accumulated meritorious\r\nservices of Mito zo Dainagoon [the father of Yoshi hisa, and rival\r\nof the Regent]; for these various considerations, of which we are\r\nmost profoundly sensible, we give him the following commands, which\r\nif he obeys we will deal leniently with him, grant that the house\r\nof Tokungawa be established [_i.e._, not destroyed from the list of\r\nDaimios], remit the capital punishment his crimes deserve, but command\r\nhim to go to the castle of Mito, and there live shut up in retirement.\r\n\r\n“2d, The castle [of the Shiogoon in Yedo] to be vacated, and delivered\r\nover to the Prince of Owarri.\r\n\r\n“3d, All the ships of war, cannon and small arms to be delivered up;\r\nwhen a proper proportion shall be returned [to the head of the house of\r\nTokungawa, which is reduced to the rank of an ordinary Daimio].\r\n\r\n“4th, The retainers living in the castle shall move out and go into\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n“5th, To all those who have aided Yoshi hisa, although their crimes\r\nare worthy of the severest punishment, the sentence of death shall be\r\nremitted, but they are to receive such other punishment as you shall\r\ndecide on. Let this be reported to the imperial government. This,\r\nhowever, does not include those persons who have an income of more than\r\n10,000 koku--_i.e._, Daimios; the imperial government alone will punish\r\nsuch.”\r\n\r\nAn important political step has been taken within the last few months,\r\nduring the present year 1869. The Daimios appear to have become aware\r\nof the weakness which inevitably accompanies division, and of the\r\nstrength which would be gained to the country by consolidation and\r\nunification under one head. The threatening position taken up by some\r\nor all of the foreign nations with whom treaties of friendship had been\r\nconcluded brought up the subject at some of the recent great councils.\r\nThe crushing defeats which had fallen upon Satsuma and Choshiu warned\r\nindividual Daimios of their weakness as units in carrying on operations\r\nof war; the enormous expense entailed upon them in procuring munitions\r\nof war, and in exercise, and in the purchase of steamers, alarmed these\r\nlords in the prospect of annihilation from exhaustion, and they came\r\nto the conclusion that such expenses could only be borne by the empire\r\nas a whole, and that to gain such an advantage the privileges of the\r\nclass must in some degree be given up. The removal of the Shiogoon\r\npresented a favorable opportunity for carrying out the proposal, and\r\nthey agreed heartily to restore all their fiefs into the hands of the\r\nEmperor, and to give up the exclusive privileges which each held in his\r\nown state, that these might all be thrown into one government, with one\r\nexchequer, one army, and one navy. The latest accounts confirm this\r\ncession of their independent rights--in which cession Satsuma, the\r\nmost powerful, but the Daimio who suffered most from the independent\r\nsystem in the very severe punishment which he received in loss of men,\r\ndestruction of steamers, and payment of indemnity, with total loss of\r\nprestige and position as a military power, has been foremost. It is\r\ntherefore reasonable to suppose that henceforth there will be only one\r\nresponsible ruling power in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEVENTS FOLLOWING THE ABOLITION OF THE SHIOGOONATE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dickson’s history was published in 1869. During the years that\r\nhave since elapsed we have witnessed a complete transformation of\r\nJapan. To make intelligible the sequence of events, it may be well to\r\ndescribe more in detail the incidents which preceded, attended and\r\nimmediately followed the downfall of the Tokungawa Shiogoonate which,\r\nfor more than two and a half centuries, had possessed the substance of\r\npower in Japan, only the shadow thereof being retained by the Mikado.\r\nWithin less than a year after January 6, 1867, when Keiki had been\r\nmade Shiogoon, much against his will, the Prince of Tosa and many able\r\nrepresentatives of the Daimio and Samurai castes urged him to resign\r\nand permit a government to be constituted on the principles which had\r\nprevailed in the ante-Shiogoon era, namely, before the year A.D. 1200.\r\nIn November, 1867, Keiki so far yielded to public opinion as to tender\r\nhis resignation; but, as the Aidzu clan, which was stanchly loyal to\r\nhim, continued to guard the Mikado’s palace, it remained for a time\r\nuncertain whether Keiki might not resume his functions. Ultimately, a\r\ncombination was formed by the Satsuma, Choshiu, Tosa, Etsizen and other\r\nclans, whereby the followers of the Tokungawa family were expelled\r\nfrom the imperial palace and an edict was issued in the name of the\r\nyoung Mikado, Mutsuhito, to the effect that the office of Shiogoon\r\nwas abolished, and that the government of Japan would be henceforth\r\ncarried on by the Mikado himself. A provisional administrator was\r\nappointed, and all the important civil and military posts were allotted\r\nto unflinching upholders of the prospective regime. The ex-Shiogoon,\r\nhowever, was persuaded by his retainers to retract his resignation,\r\nand, at the head of a large force, he undertook to re-enter Kioto\r\n[Miako] for the purpose of reasserting his former authority. After a\r\nbattle, which lasted three days, he was beaten by the loyal troops and\r\nwas forced to take refuge in his castle, where he announced that he\r\nwould never again take up arms against the Mikado. Nevertheless, the\r\nTokungawa clan showed, for a time, signs of disaffection; but by July\r\n1, 1869, all vestiges of rebellion had ceased and the Mikado’s party\r\nwas triumphant. The trials of the new government now began. The Kuge,\r\nor court nobles, and the whole body of Samurai, or two-sworded men,\r\ndesired to drive foreigners out of the country, but Okubo, Goto and\r\nKido, who were conversant with foreign ideas, opposed the execution of\r\nthe plan and sent a noble of the imperial court to give the Mikado’s\r\nconsent to the treaties and to invite the foreign Ministers to an\r\naudience with the Emperor in Kioto. The conversion of the court nobles\r\nto the party that desired to see Japan reconstructed on European\r\nprinciples now went on rapidly, and the young Mikado was induced to\r\nappear in person before the Council of State and to promise that a\r\ndeliberative assembly should be eventually formed. Indicative of an\r\nintention to revolutionize the mode of government was the Emperor’s\r\ndeparture from Kioto, which had been the seat of his ancestors for\r\ntwenty-five centuries, and his adoption of Yedo, thenceforth called\r\nTokio, for his capital. To a considerable extent, freedom of the\r\npress was now guaranteed, and a number of newspapers sprung up. Books\r\nexpounding European methods of thought and education were published,\r\nand many pamphlets advocating the abolition of feudalism appeared.\r\nFour of the great Daimios, or feudal lords, advocated the change. They\r\naddressed a memorial to the throne offering to restore the registers\r\nof their clans and proposing that the Mikado should resume possession\r\nof their fiefs. In conformity to this request, an edict was issued in\r\nSeptember, 1871, summoning the Daimios to Tokio for the purpose of\r\narranging their retirement to private life. With scarcely an exception,\r\nthe order was obeyed; even the Daimios who disapproved of the measure\r\nwere unwilling to oppose the resolute men who had framed the edict. The\r\ntruth is that, even under the feudal system, the real power in each\r\nclan had lain in the hands of able men of inferior rank who ruled their\r\nnominal masters. These are the men who, during the last thirty years,\r\nhave controlled Japan. Having first driven the Shiogoon into private\r\nlife, they then compelled the Daimios to follow him into retirement. Of\r\nthe men who have governed the country since 1868, not one is a Daimio\r\nby birth, and only two or three are Kuge, or court nobles. Almost all\r\nwere simple Samurai, or retainers of the territorial lords.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that, in 1869, the Emperor returned to Kioto for\r\na brief visit, in order to perform certain ceremonies at his father’s\r\ntomb, and, during his sojourn in the western capital, he married the\r\npresent Empress, who was a princess of one of the five regent families,\r\nfrom which the highest officers under the Mikado have always been\r\nselected, and from which the emperors have habitually chosen their\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Emperor had promised to convoke a deliberative\r\nassembly. This promise was, at first, kept to the ear, rather than\r\nthe hope. A so-called Kogisho or Parliament was formed of persons\r\nrepresenting each of the Daimiates, and designated for the position\r\nby the Daimios. It was a mere debating society, whose function was to\r\ngive advice to the imperial government. How conservative the advice\r\ngiven by this body was may be measured by the fact that it refused to\r\nrecommend the abolition of the privilege of hari-kari, or of the custom\r\nof wearing swords. This Kogisho lasted only for some months, being\r\ndissolved in the autumn of the same year in which it was created.\r\n\r\nSoon after the suppression of the feudal system in Japan, the\r\nDaimiates, considered as administrative areas, were superseded by\r\nPrefectures. At first, the ex-Daimios were appointed Prefects, but\r\nmost of them were soon found to be unfit for high executive office,\r\nand they have been gradually replaced by competent persons drawn from\r\nthe Samurai class. It should further be noted that the extinction of\r\nfeudalism imposed some onerous financial obligations. It was decided\r\nthat each ex-Daimio, and each of the sub-feudatories that had been\r\ndependent on him, should receive one-tenth of the income which they\r\nhad drawn from their fiefs. This income was to be free from any claim\r\nfor the support of the Samurai who had formed the standing army in\r\neach clan. The central government undertook to make all payments to\r\nthe Samurai for services of any kind. The assumption of this burden\r\ncompelled the government to borrow $165,000,000. In lieu of the\r\npensions which they had formerly received, lump sums were given to\r\nthe Samurai, but these were soon squandered, and much poverty and want\r\nwere eventually experienced by the ex-feudal retainers. Among other\r\nremarkable events which took place in 1871, should be mentioned the\r\nremoval of the ancient disqualification of the _eta_ and _heimin_,\r\nwhereby these pariah castes were placed on the same legal footing as\r\nthe rest of the population. In the following year, the first railway\r\nin Japan was opened. This was a line between Yokohama and Tokio. In\r\n1873, the European calendar was adopted, so far as the beginning of the\r\nyear and the beginning of the months are concerned. The year is still\r\nreckoned, however, from Jimmu Tenno, which is 1873 of the Christian\r\nera, and corresponds to the year 2533 of the Japanese era. Still\r\nemployed occasionally, also, is the Meiji year-period, which began in\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 1872, the remodeling of the Japanese system of\r\neducation was undertaken. In April of that year, the Mikado, Mutsuhito,\r\nvisited the Imperial College, subsequently to be known as the Imperial\r\nUniversity. The new buildings consisted of three wings, each 192 feet\r\nlong, joined to a main edifice 324 feet in length. The students in this\r\ninstitution soon numbered 350, taught by 20 foreign professors. The\r\nforeign language school, in which pupils learned English or some other\r\nEuropean language, preparatory to entering the college, presently had\r\n600 students and 20 foreign teachers. For educational purposes, the\r\nempire was divided into eight districts, in each of which a university\r\nwas contemplated, which was to be supplied by 210 secondary schools\r\nof foreign languages. It was arranged that the elementary vernacular\r\nschools should number 53,000, or one for every 600 persons in Japan.\r\nTo these elementary establishments were to be deputed native teachers\r\ntrained in normal schools. Before many years had passed, the school\r\nattendance was computed at three millions.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1872, two legations and three consulates were\r\nestablished abroad. Before long, the number was increased to ten. The\r\nJapanese press quickly emerged from the realm of experiment and became\r\na powerful civilizing force. In the course of a few years, ten daily\r\nnewspapers in the capital and 200 publications in the empire, equipped\r\nwith metal type and printing presses, began to flood the country with\r\ninformation and awaken thought. In the department of jurisprudence,\r\nalso, great progress was made. Since the restoration of the Mikado\r\nto actual power, revised statutes have greatly decreased the list of\r\ncapital punishments; the condition of the prisons has been ameliorated;\r\nlegal processes have been improved from the viewpoint of justice, and\r\nthe use of torture to obtain testimony has been entirely abolished.\r\nLaw schools were established, and to accused persons was given the\r\nassistance of counsel for their defense. By the year 1874, there had\r\nbeen a great change for the better in the diet, clothing, and hygienic\r\nprotection of the people. In the year named, there were in the empire\r\none government hospital and twenty-one hospitals assisted by government\r\ngrants, twenty-nine private hospitals, 5,247 physicians practicing\r\naccording to the principles and methods of Western science, and 5,205\r\napothecaries. In 1875, there were 325 students in the medical colleges\r\nat Tokio and Nagasaki, and there were some twenty-five foreign surgeons\r\nand physicians in the employ of the Japanese government. Public decency\r\nwas improved and the standards of Christendom approached. The sale of\r\norphan female children to brothel keepers, the traffic in native or\r\nEuropean obscene pictures, lascivious dances, the exhibition of nude\r\nsinging girls, the custom of promiscuous bathing in the public baths,\r\nand the toleration of nakedness on the part of the rural coolies\r\nwere brought to an end. Religious persecution ceased. All the native\r\nChristians who had been exiled or imprisoned in 1868-69 were set free\r\nand restored to their villages. We note, finally, that, as early as\r\n1876, the fulfillment of the promise made by the Mikado in 1868, that\r\n“intellect and learning should be sought for throughout the world,” had\r\nbeen so far fulfilled that 400 foreigners from many Western countries\r\nhad been invited to occupy posts in the government civil service. In\r\n1870, there had been not ten Protestant Christians in the empire. By\r\nMay, 1876, there were ten Protestant churches, with a membership of 800\r\nsouls. In March of the year just named, Prime Minister Sanjo issued a\r\nproclamation abolishing the custom of wearing two swords. This measure,\r\nwhich had been first advocated by Arinori Mori in 1870, now became\r\nlaw throughout the land. It was in August, 1876, that the commutation\r\nof the hereditary pensions and life incomes of the Samurai, which\r\npreviously had been optional, was made compulsory. This act forced the\r\nprivileged classes to begin to earn their bread. In the same month, the\r\nempire was redivided and the 68 Ken, or Prefectures, were reduced in\r\nnumber to 35. It was to be expected that the progressive course of the\r\nMikado’s Ministers would excite some disaffection. There were during\r\nthis year some insurrections on the part not only of discontented\r\nSamurai, but also of the farmers on whom the burdens of taxation mainly\r\nfell. It was to redress the grievances of the agricultural class that,\r\nin January, 1877, the national land tax was reduced from 3 to 2½ per\r\ncent, while the local tax, which had formerly amounted to one-third\r\nof the land tax, was cut down to one-fifth. About the same time, the\r\nsalaries of nearly all the government officers were diminished, several\r\nthousand office-holders were discharged, the Department of Revision\r\nand the Prefecture of Police were abolished, and their functions were\r\ntransferred to the Home Department. An annual saving of about eight\r\nmillion dollars was thus effected, and the loss to the Treasury from\r\nthe curtailment of land taxation was made good. In 1877, however, a\r\ngreat rebellion broke out in Satsuma, instigated by Saigo Takamori,\r\nwho had been formerly a marshal of the empire. After a contest of\r\nsome months, the imperial authority was everywhere re-established,\r\nand Saigo, at his own request, was beheaded by one of his friends.\r\nThis insurrection represented the final struggle between the forces of\r\nfeudalism and misrule against order and unity. The contest cost Japan\r\n$50,000,000 and many thousands of lives. In the ultimate treatment of\r\nthe rebels, the government displayed a spirit of leniency worthy of an\r\nenlightened state. Of upward of 38,000 persons tried in Kiushiu, only\r\ntwenty were decapitated, about 1,800 were condemned to imprisonment,\r\nand some 36,000 were pardoned. During the same year, 1877, the cholera\r\nbroke out in Japan, but, owing to the enforcement of sanitary measures,\r\nthere were but 6,297 deaths.\r\n\r\nThe Mikado had now been governing Japan for ten years by means of an\r\nirresponsible Ministry. The oath which he had taken at Kioto in 1868\r\nto form a deliberative assembly had never been fully carried out. We\r\nhave seen that the Kogisho, or advisory body, called into existence in\r\n1868, had been dissolved in the same year. Subsequently, in 1875, a\r\nSenate had been established and an assembly of the ken governors, or\r\nprefects, held one session. The meetings of the latter body, however,\r\nwere soon indefinitely postponed. Nevertheless, the era of personal\r\ngovernment was drawing to a close. On July 22, 1878, a long step\r\nwas taken toward representative institutions by an edict convoking\r\nprovincial parliaments or local assemblies which were to sit once a\r\nyear in each ken or province. Under the supervision of the Minister of\r\nthe Interior, these bodies were empowered to discuss questions of local\r\ntaxation, and to petition the central government on other matters of\r\nlocal interest. There were both educational and property qualifications\r\nof the franchise. Each voter had to prove his ability to read and\r\nwrite, and he must have paid an annual land tax of at least five\r\ndollars. In October, 1881, the Mikado announced by a proclamation that,\r\nin 1890, a Parliament would be established. In June, 1884, an edict was\r\nissued readjusting the system of nobility. In the newly created orders\r\nof princes, marquises, counts, viscounts and barons, were observed\r\nthe names of many men who had once belonged to the class of Samurai,\r\nor gentry, but who had earned promotion by distinguished services on\r\nbehalf of their country. Three hundred persons, that may be described\r\nas pertaining to the aristocracy of intellect, were thus ennobled on\r\nthe score of merit. It was expected that out of these newly created\r\nnobles would be constituted the upper house, or Chamber of Notables,\r\nin the Parliament which was to come into being in 1890. In December,\r\n1885, the triple premiership, the Privy Council and the Ministries,\r\nas they had been hitherto established, came to an end. In their place\r\nwas created a Cabinet, at the head of which was a Minister-President.\r\nThe old government boards, together with a new board, which was to\r\nsupervise the post-office, telegraph and railway, were organized in\r\nsuch a way as to discharge many thousand office-holders. All the\r\nmembers of the new Cabinet were men of modern ideas, and such Asiatic\r\nfeatures as the government had hitherto retained were now extinguished.\r\nBy 1886, notable progress had been made in the applications of steam\r\nand electricity. Of railroads there were already 265 miles open, 271\r\nmiles in course of construction, and 543 miles contemplated. Although\r\nthese lines were built and equipped on British models, most of the\r\nsurveying, engineering and constructive work and all of the mechanical\r\nlabor were performed by natives. The trains and engines were worked\r\nby Japanese; such light materials as were made of wood and metal\r\nwere manufactured in Japan, only the heavy castings, the rails and\r\nthe engines being brought from Great Britain. The telephone and the\r\nelectric light were now seen in the large cities, and four cables\r\nconnected the island empire with the Asiatic mainland. Already the\r\nJapan Mail Shipping Company employed a large fleet of steamships and\r\nsailing vessels in their coasting trade and passenger lines. We add\r\nthat, in 1885, the Postal Department forwarded nearly 100,000,000\r\nletters and packages.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had, for some time, recognized that education is the basis\r\nof progress, and that their efforts for intellectual advancement were\r\nseriously impeded by their use of the Chinese graphic system. They\r\nperceived that what they needed most of all was an alphabet. In 1884,\r\nthe Roma-ji-Kai, or Roman Letter Association, was formed in Tokio,\r\nand, within two years, had 6,000 members, native and foreign. As their\r\nname implies, their purpose was to supplant the Chinese character and\r\nnative syllabary by the Roman alphabet, as the vehicle of Japanese\r\nthought. It was demonstrated that all possible sounds and vocal\r\ncombinations could be expressed by using twenty-two Roman letters. It\r\nwas further proved that, by means of the Roman alphabet, a child could\r\nlearn to read the colloquial and book language in one-tenth of the time\r\nformerly required. Scarcely was the Roman Letter Association under way\r\nthan it printed a newspaper, edited text-books, and transliterated\r\npopular and classic texts in the appropriate characters of the Roman\r\nalphabet. By an imperial decree, issued in November, 1884, the English\r\nlanguage was made part of the order of study in the common schools.\r\nMeanwhile, the progress of Christianity acquired considerable momentum.\r\nNot only were many converts made by Catholic missionaries, but, by the\r\nend of 1885, there were 200 Protestant churches, with a membership of\r\nover 13,000. In December, 1885, the Mikado’s Cabinet was reorganized,\r\nand, during the next four years, Ito and Inouye were the principal\r\nmolders of the national policy. In April, 1888, a new body called the\r\nPrivy Council was created, of which Ito became President, while Kuroda\r\nfilled the position of Prime Minister. In this body, active debate upon\r\nthe forthcoming Constitution began in May of the year last-named, and\r\nproceeded until February 11, 1889, when the long-awaited instrument was\r\nproclaimed. Exactly thirty-five years after the American treaty-ships\r\nappeared in sight of Idzu, the Mikado, Mutsuhito, took oath to maintain\r\nthe government according to the Constitution, the documents defining\r\nwhich he, before an audience of nobles, officials and foreign envoys,\r\nhanded to Kuroda, the principal Minister of State. On this occasion,\r\nfor the first time in Japan’s history, the Emperor rode beside the\r\nEmpress in public. The one blot upon the record of the day was the\r\nassassination of the Minister of Education, Arinori Mori, by a\r\nShintoist fanatic.\r\n\r\nLet us glance at some of the features of Japan’s fundamental organic\r\nlaw. The Constitution proper consists of sixty-six articles, but,\r\nsimultaneously with it, two hundred and sixty-six expositionary laws\r\nwere proclaimed. In the first place, the Mikado’s person was declared\r\nsacred and inviolable. In him continued to be concentrated the rights\r\nof sovereignty, which, however, he was to exercise according to the\r\nprovisions of the organic law. A Diet or Parliament was created to\r\nmeet once a year, and to be opened, closed, prorogued and dissolved by\r\nthe Emperor. Its debates are public. The Mikado’s Ministers may take\r\nseats and speak in either House, but are accountable, not to the Diet,\r\nbut to the Emperor alone. Bills raising revenue and appropriating the\r\nsame require the consent of the Diet, but certain fixed expenditures,\r\nprovided for by the Constitution, cannot be abolished or curtailed\r\nwithout the concurrence of the Executive. To a large extent, the\r\npower over the purse is thus withheld from the representatives of\r\nthe people. The tenure of judges is for good behavior. The Upper\r\nHouse consists partly of hereditary, partly of elected, and partly of\r\nnominated members; the combined number, however, of the members of\r\nthe two last-named classes is not to exceed that of those who hold\r\nheritable titles of nobility. The House of Representatives consists of\r\nabout 300 members, who serve four years. For them there is a property\r\nqualification; they must pay annually national taxes to the amount of\r\nfifteen yen or dollars. Those who elect them must also pay national\r\ntaxes to the same amount. Those persons who pay taxes to the amount of\r\nover five yen are entitled to vote for members of the local assembly.\r\nThese numbered, in 1887, about 1,500,000, whereas the electorate of\r\nthe national House of Representatives numbered only about 300,000. We\r\nobserve, lastly, that certain fundamental rights were guaranteed to\r\nthe Japanese people. They have, for instance, the right of changing\r\ntheir domicile. Except according to law, they are not to be arrested,\r\ndetained or punished. They are also to enjoy the right of freedom from\r\nsearch, the inviolability of letters, freedom of religious belief\r\nand the liberty of speech, petition, writing, publishing, association\r\nand public meeting within the limits of laws to be laid down by the\r\nnational Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe threefold election--namely, for a fraction of the Upper House, for\r\nthe whole of the national House of Representatives, and for the local\r\nassembly--took place in July, 1890. About eighty-five per cent of\r\neligible voters availed themselves of the franchise, and there was a\r\ngreat superfluity of candidates. It turned out at the ballot-box that\r\nto be in any way connected with government employment was to invite\r\nalmost certain defeat, while, on the other hand, few of the old party\r\nleaders were chosen as standard-bearers in the new Parliamentary field.\r\nWe add that, on April 22, 1890, a new code of civil procedure, and the\r\nfirst portion of a Civil Code, were promulgated; since 1881, a new\r\nCriminal Code based on the principles of Western jurisprudence has been\r\nin successful operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFOREIGN POLICY OF NEW JAPAN AND WAR WITH CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to consider separately the foreign policy which\r\nwas gradually evolved after the transformation of Japan that followed\r\nthe Mikado’s resumption of actual power. Scarcely had the Shiogoon been\r\noverthrown than the desire of conquest and expansion was reawakened.\r\nRepresentatives of the advanced school of Japanese ideas presently\r\nmaintained that the national jurisdiction should include not only Yezo,\r\nSaghalien and the Bonin islands, but also Corea and the eastern part\r\nof Formosa, the last claim being based upon settlements made by the\r\nJapanese. The Bonin islands, first occupied by Ogasawara, a Daimio,\r\nin 1593, and visited by a party of explorers from Nagasaki in 1675,\r\nhad been neglected by the Japanese for centuries, though long a noted\r\nresort of whalers. In 1878, the islands were formally reoccupied in\r\nthe name of the Mikado, and a local government established by Japanese\r\nofficers. Saghalien and the Kurile islands had been a debatable ground\r\nbetween the Japanese and the Russians since 1790, and had been the\r\nscene of a good deal of bloodshed. In 1875, Admiral Enomoto concluded\r\nat St. Petersburg a convention by which Russia received the whole of\r\nSaghalien, while Japan obtained all the Kurile islands. The large\r\nisland of Yezo was administered by a special department until the\r\nyear 1882, when it was divided into three ken, or prefectures, which\r\nare governed like the rest of the empire. Let us glance, next, at\r\nJapan’s assumption of sovereignty over the little island kingdom of\r\nRiu Kiu, or Loo Choo, an assumption which subjected the relations\r\nbetween China and Japan to severe tension. These islands are strung\r\nlike a long thread between Japan and Formosa. For many centuries, these\r\nislanders sent tribute to both China and Japan. Toward the close of the\r\nsixteenth century, Hideyoshi demanded that they should pay tribute to\r\nJapan alone; but he never enforced his demands. In 1609, Iyehisa, the\r\nDaimio of Satsuma, conquered the islands, and made their chiefs swear\r\nallegiance to his house and to the Shiogoon. Between 1611 and 1850,\r\nno fewer than fifteen embassies from Riu Kiu visited Yedo to obtain\r\ninvestiture for the island king, or to congratulate a Shiogoon upon his\r\naccession to power. The same policy, however, was pursued toward China\r\nalso. After the revolution of 1868 the Loo Choo islands were made a\r\ndependency of the Japanese empire, and the king acknowledged the Mikado\r\nfor his suzerain. Some five years later, the Japanese reduced the king\r\nto the status of a retired Daimio, and transformed Riu Kiu into a ken,\r\nor prefecture. To this the islanders objected, and continued to send a\r\ntribute-junk to Ningpo, and implored China’s interposition. The Pekin\r\ngovernment, on its part, considered that Japan, by its annexation of\r\nthe Loo Choo islands, had wrongfully cut off a fringe of the robe of\r\nthe Middle Kingdom.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance at Japan’s connection with Formosa, before examining,\r\nsomewhat in detail, her much more important relations to Corea. It was\r\ntoward the end of 1873 that a Loo Choo junk was wrecked on the eastern\r\nshore of Formosa; the crew were killed by the savage inhabitants of\r\nthat region, and, as it was reported, eaten. The Loo Choo islanders\r\nappealed to their hereditary suzerain at Satsuma, who referred the\r\nmatter to Tokio. As it happened, China laid no claim to the eastern\r\npart of Formosa, and no trace of it appeared on the maps of the Middle\r\nKingdom. In the spring of 1874, the Mikado dispatched Soyejima as\r\nEmbassador to Pekin, and his representative there obtained an audience\r\nwith the Chinese Emperor. The Tsungli Yamen disclaimed responsibility\r\nfor eastern Formosa, and conceded the right of Japan to chastise the\r\nsavages there. While Soyejima was absent in China, a Japanese junk\r\nwas wrecked in Formosa, and its crew were stripped and plundered. On\r\nthe return of the Embassy, 1,300 Japanese soldiers, under the command\r\nof Saigo Yorimichi, were ordered to avenge the outrage, and, after\r\na few skirmishes with savages, they proceeded to occupy the eastern\r\npart of Formosa. There they built roads, organized camps, and directed\r\nfortifications in accordance with the principles of modern engineering\r\nand military art. Incited, it is said, by foreign influence, the\r\nChinese government now began to urge its claims upon the whole of\r\nFormosa, and to denounce the Japanese as intruders. For a time war\r\nseemed inevitable, but the result of the negotiations, intrusted to\r\nOkubo, who was sent to Pekin, was that the Chinese paid an indemnity\r\nof $700,000, and the Japanese evacuated the island. The abortive\r\nexpedition had cost Japan $5,000,000 and seven hundred lives.\r\n\r\nJapan’s relations with Corea were to have much more momentous\r\nconsequences. During the Tokungawa period, the so-called Hermit\r\nKingdom had sent regularly embassies conveying homage to Japan; but,\r\nnot relishing the change which the latter country underwent in 1868,\r\ndisgusted at the departure of the Mikado’s government from traditional\r\nideals, and emboldened by the failure of the French and American\r\nexpeditions against her own territory, Corea sent to Tokio insulting\r\nletters, in which she taunted Japan with slavish truckling to the\r\nforeign barbarians, and declared herself an enemy. This incident, which\r\ntook place in 1872, rendered the project of a war with Corea extremely\r\npopular in the Japanese army and navy. Some years, however, were to\r\nelapse before an armed contest took place between the two countries. In\r\n1875, Mr. Arinori Mori was dispatched to Pekin, and Kuroda Kiyotaka,\r\nat the head of some men-of-war, entered Corean waters. The twofold\r\ndiplomatic and naval demonstration was crowned with success. A treaty\r\nof peace, friendship and commerce was concluded between Japan and Corea\r\non February 27, 1876. In pursuance of this treaty, Japan, in 1876,\r\nsecured the opening of the port of Fushan to her trade, as compensation\r\nfor an outrage perpetrated on some of her sailors. In 1880, Chemulpo,\r\nthe port of Seoul, the Corean capital, was also thrown open to Japanese\r\ncommerce. The activity of the Japanese gave umbrage to the court of\r\nPekin, and, in 1881, a draft commercial treaty was drawn up by the\r\nChinese authorities, in conjunction with the representatives of the\r\nprincipal Western powers at the Chinese capital, and carried to Seoul\r\nfor acceptance by the American naval officer, Commodore Schufeldt. The\r\ntreaty, being recommended by China, was, naturally, accepted by Corea.\r\nWhen the Japanese, however, observed that the Chinese were putting\r\nforward a pretension to control exclusively the destinies of the Hermit\r\nKingdom, they determined to assert their old claim to an equal voice\r\nwith China in the Corean peninsula. They allied themselves with the\r\nso-called progressive party in Corea, and thus forced China to link her\r\nfortunes with the reactionists.\r\n\r\nExcept among the reformers, who constituted but a weak minority of the\r\nCorean population, the Japanese were far from popular in the Hermit\r\nKingdom, and, in June, 1882, the reactionists attacked the Japanese\r\nLegation, murdered some of its inmates and compelled the survivors to\r\nflee. Thereupon, the Japanese sent a force to exact reparation, while\r\nthe Chinese, on their part, sent a force to restore order. A temporary\r\naccommodation was effected, but, for two years, Chinese and Japanese\r\nsoldiers remained close to one another under the walls of Seoul. In\r\nDecember, 1884, a second collision occurred between the Japanese and\r\nCoreans, the latter being aided this time by the Chinese. The first\r\nnamed were compelled to flee. The Tokio government obtained reparation\r\nfor this fresh outrage, but, not satisfied therewith, it dispatched\r\nCount Ito to Pekin to bring about some permanent arrangement. There\r\nis no doubt that, at this time, the Chinese occupied a much stronger\r\nposition in Corea than did the Mikado’s subjects, but the advantage\r\nwas thrown away by an agreement which tied China’s hands and had\r\nfar-reaching consequences.\r\n\r\nLi Hung Chang was appointed Plenipotentiary to negotiate with Count\r\nIto, and a convention was signed by them at Tientsin, on April 18,\r\n1885. It provided, first, that both countries should recall their\r\ntroops from Corea; secondly, that no more officers should be sent by\r\neither country to drill Corean soldiers; and, thirdly, that if, at any\r\nfuture time, either of the parties to the convention should decide to\r\nsend a force to Corea, it must straightway inform the other. By this\r\ncompact, China acknowledged that Japan’s right to control Corea was\r\non a level with her own, and it was henceforth unreasonable for the\r\nPekin authorities to speak of Corea as a vassal State. For nine years\r\nafter the conclusion of the Tientsin Convention, peace prevailed in the\r\nHermit Kingdom. In the spring of 1894, however, the Tong Haks, a body\r\nof religious reformers, broke into open rebellion, and, toward the end\r\nof May, obtained a considerable success over the troops of the Corean\r\nGovernment. China was at once requested to dispatch a force to save the\r\ncapital, and, by the 10th of June, 2,000 Chinese soldiers were encamped\r\nat Asan, a port some distance to the south of Seoul. A few Chinese\r\nmen-of-war were also ordered to cruise off the Corean coasts. In\r\npursuance of the terms of the Tientsin Convention, notification of the\r\ndispatch of these forces to Corea was given to the Tokio government,\r\nwhich, having had equal rights conceded to it, was resolved to exercise\r\nthem with promptitude and vigor. Within forty-eight hours after the\r\narrival of the Chinese at Asan, the Japanese had placed a far superior\r\nnumber of soldiers at Seoul, and of ships at Chemulpo. They thus\r\nsecured complete possession of the capital and of the court, although\r\nboth had been in thorough sympathy with China. To avert an insurrection\r\nin Seoul, it was thought needful to secure the person of the King of\r\nCorea, and his palace was, accordingly, captured by the Japanese, and\r\nthe ruler of the peninsula converted into their tool or ally. He was,\r\nforthwith, required to put his seal to a document ordering the Chinese\r\ntroops, who had come at his invitation, to leave the country. This\r\nseizure of the King’s person took place on July 23, 1894. Two days\r\nlater, the Japanese squadron attacked the transport “Kowshing” and some\r\narmed vessels which were convoying it. In the ensuing engagement, one\r\nChinese man-of-war was sunk, one was disabled, and 1,200 soldiers went\r\ndown with the “Kowshing.” On the same day, the Japanese General Oshima\r\nleft Seoul with a small force to attack the Chinese camp, which had\r\nbeen transferred from Asan to Song-hwan, a strongly fortified position.\r\nThe place was carried on July 29 by a night surprise with a loss to\r\nthe Chinese of 500 killed and wounded; the remainder of the force then\r\nretreated to Pingyang, a town north of Seoul, on the main road to\r\nChina. These encounters were followed by a reciprocal declaration of\r\nwar between China and Japan on August 1, 1894. There ensued a lull in\r\nhostilities, during which Japan poured her troops into Corea, while\r\nthe Chinese fleet remained inactive in the harbors of Wei-hai-Wei\r\nand Port Arthur. About the beginning of September, a Japanese force\r\nof 13,000 men under General Nodzu was ordered to attack the strong\r\nposition occupied by the Chinese at Pingyang. The assault was delivered\r\non May 15, and the Chinese were compelled to retreat with a loss of\r\n2,000 killed, in addition to the wounded and prisoners. The sturdiness\r\nof the defense at certain points was attested by the fact that the\r\nvictors themselves lost 633 killed, wounded and missing. The capture of\r\nPingyang resulted in the Chinese evacuation of Corea.\r\n\r\nWhile the fighting was taking place on land at Pingyang, the Chinese\r\nfleet, under the command of Admiral Ting, was conveying troops to the\r\nmouth of the Yalu River, the northwestern boundary of Corea, where the\r\nChinese were collecting a second army. Returning from the fulfillment\r\nof this task, the fleet was encountered off the island of Hai Yang\r\non September 17, by a Japanese squadron under Admiral Ito. The naval\r\ncombatants were nearly equal in strength, each numbering ten war\r\nvessels; two of the Chinese ships, however, were superior in armament.\r\nThe result of the action was that five of the Chinese torpedo-boats\r\nwere destroyed, and the total loss of the Chinese in killed and wounded\r\nwas 1,000, while that of the Japanese was but 265.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, having been re-enforced by a considerable body of\r\nsoldiers under Marshal Yamagata, began their forward movement from\r\nPingyang early in October, 1894, and on the 10th of the month reached\r\nthe Yalu, where they found a considerable Chinese army posted on the\r\nnorthern bank of the river. After a merely nominal resistance, however,\r\nthe Chinese officers and soldiers abandoned their fortifications on\r\nOctober 25 and 26, thus allowing the Japanese to capture an enormous\r\nquantity of war materials, including seventy-four cannon, over 4,000\r\nrifles and more than 4,000,000 rounds of ammunition. While Marshal\r\nYamagata was forcing the passage of the Yalu, another Japanese army\r\nunder Marshal Oyama had landed on the Liau-tung, or Regent’s Sword\r\npeninsula, with the view of assailing the great naval station of Port\r\nArthur. The natural and artificial strength of this place was great;\r\nover 300 guns were in position, and the garrison numbered at least\r\n10,000 men, while the assailants did not exceed 13,000, although, of\r\ncourse, they were materially aided by their fleet. Having landed at the\r\nmouth of the Hua-yuan River, about 100 miles north of Port Arthur,\r\nthe Japanese pushed southward and captured the well-fortified city of\r\nChinchow without losing a man. On the next day, they had a similar\r\nexperience at Talien-wan, where they found over 120 cannon, 2,500,000\r\nrounds of artillery ammunition, and nearly 34,000,000 rifle cartridges.\r\nOn November 22, 1894, the Japanese army and fleet made a concerted\r\nattack upon Port Arthur, and, with the loss of eighteen men killed\r\nand 250 wounded, gained possession of a naval stronghold on which\r\n$20,000,000 had been spent. During the following month of December, the\r\nforce under Marshal Yamagata advanced into Manchuria, but here they\r\nwere confronted by a fresh Chinese army, which had been assembled to\r\ndefend Mukden, the old Manchu capital, and which evinced a good deal\r\nof courage. In one fight at Kangwasai, the Japanese experienced a loss\r\nof 400 men, and the subsequent capture of Kaiping cost them 300 killed\r\nand wounded. About the middle of January, 1895, the energies of the\r\nJapanese were turned against the naval fortress of Wei-hai-Wei, which\r\nis situated on the northern coast of Shantung, opposite Port Arthur,\r\nand constitutes, with the last-named place, the keys of the Gulf of\r\nPechili. After landing, on January 20, at Yungchang, a little west\r\nof the place to be attacked, the Japanese, six days later, appeared\r\nat the gates of Wei-hai-Wei. The place was defended not only by a\r\nsemicircular line of forts and batteries and two fortified islands\r\nin the bay, but also by the Chinese fleet under Admiral Ting, which\r\ncomprised nine large vessels, besides six small gunboats and seven\r\nlarge and four small torpedo-boats. The attack began on January 29,\r\nand continued for three weeks; nor would Admiral Ting, even then, have\r\nconsented to surrender, had he not received a telegraphed message from\r\nLi Hung Chang to the effect that no help need be looked for. After the\r\nterms of surrender were agreed upon, the Chinese admiral committed\r\nsuicide. After the fall of Wei-hai-Wei, the Japanese in Manchuria\r\ncontinued their advance, and captured the twin city of Newchang,\r\nthus placing themselves between Mukden and the Chinese capital.\r\nWhen spring was about to open, they possessed an army of 100,000\r\nmen, ready to move upon Pekin, and there is no doubt that they could\r\nhave taken the city speedily and easily. Two months previously, the\r\nChinese had sent to Tokio a pretended peace mission with inadequate\r\npowers, but now the Pekin government, recognizing the impossibility of\r\nresistance, appointed Li Hung Chang plenipotentiary, and dispatched\r\nhim to Shimonoseki, which he reached on March 20, 1895. Luckily for\r\nthe success of his mission, he was shot in the cheek by a fanatic four\r\ndays after his arrival, while he was returning from a conference with\r\nCount Ito, the representative of Japan. This outrage aroused great\r\nsympathy for Li Hung Chang, and, to prove the sincerity of his regret,\r\nthe Mikado consented to an armistice, and sensibly modified the terms\r\nof peace upon which he had originally insisted. On April 17, 1895, the\r\nTreaty of Shimonoseki was signed, and, on May 8, the ratifications were\r\nexchanged at Chefoo. The provisions of the treaty may be briefly summed\r\nup as follows: The Chinese were to surrender the islands of Formosa and\r\nthe Pescadores, and also, on the Asiatic mainland, the southern part\r\nof the province of Shingking, including the Regent’s Sword peninsula,\r\nand, of course, the naval fortress of Port Arthur. By way of pecuniary\r\nindemnity, China was to pay 200,000,000 Kuping taels, or, say,\r\n$170,000,000, in eight installments, with interest at the rate of five\r\nper cent on those unpaid. The commercial concessions were to include\r\nthe admission of ships under the Japanese flag to the different rivers\r\nand lakes of China and the appointment of consuls; and the Japanese\r\nwere to retain Wei-hai-Wei until the whole indemnity had been paid and\r\nan acceptable commercial treaty had been concluded. These terms were\r\nby no means excessive, in view of the completeness of the Japanese\r\ntriumph, but they gave great umbrage to Russia, which foresaw that the\r\npresence of the Japanese on the Regent’s Sword peninsula would prove\r\nan obstacle to its plans of southward extension through Manchuria,\r\nand to the attainment of an ice-free port. Moreover, had the Japanese\r\nbeen suffered to remain on the mainland of Asia, they, instead of the\r\nRussians, would have become preponderant at Pekin. Accordingly, the\r\nCzar’s advisers, having secured the co-operation not only of their\r\nFrench ally, but also of Germany, proceeded to make a diplomatic move,\r\nthe aim of which was to despoil the Mikado of a part of the fruits of\r\nvictory. Scarcely was the ink dry on the Treaty of Shimonoseki, when\r\nJapan received from the three European powers just named a polite\r\nrequest, which veiled, of course, a threat, that she should waive\r\nthat part of the Shimonoseki Treaty which provided for the cession of\r\nPort Arthur and the Liau-tung peninsula. Japan would doubtless have\r\nrepelled the demand, had she been assured of Great Britain’s support.\r\nBut no assurance to that effect was forthcoming from Lord Rosebery,\r\nthen British Prime Minister, and, accordingly, the Mikado consented\r\nto resign his claim to the Liau-tung peninsula for the additional\r\nindemnity of $30,000,000. The final installment of the indemnity was\r\npaid in May, 1898, whereupon Wei-hai-Wei was evacuated by the Japanese,\r\nand, soon afterward, was ceded by the Pekin government to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSince the compulsory revision of the Shimonoseki Treaty, the attitude\r\nof the Tokio Foreign Office has been marked by much reserve and\r\ndignity. Japan has employed the years that have since elapsed, and the\r\nmoney received from China, in prosecuting extensive military and naval\r\nreforms. Nor is the time distant when, with the warships built at home\r\nor purchased in foreign shipyards, she will have a navy only second\r\nto that possessed by Great Britain in the Far East, and will be able\r\nto place half a million thoroughly trained and equipped soldiers on\r\nthe mainland of Asia. In Corea, she has obtained increased freedom of\r\naction, Russia having practically waived her claims to ascendency in\r\nthat country; Japan has turned the opportunity to account by building\r\na railway from Chemulpo to Seoul, which should materially help her to\r\nmaintain control of the Hermit Kingdom. Whatever may be the Mikado’s\r\nultimate intention, he has, as yet, given no conclusive proof of a wish\r\nto participate in the game of partition now being played in China. No\r\nprotest came from him when, toward the close of 1897, Germany seized\r\nthe harbor of Kiao Chou, or when, on March 27, 1898, a convention\r\nsigned at Pekin gave the Russians the usufruct of Port Arthur and\r\nTalien-wan. In September, however, the Marquis (formerly Count) Ito\r\nwas dispatched as a special embassador to the Chinese capital, for the\r\npurpose, as it is believed, but not positively known, of arranging an\r\nalliance between the Japanese and Chinese empires, which should put an\r\neffectual stop to further encroachments on the part of Russia. Then\r\noccurred the palace revolution at Pekin, whereby the young Emperor\r\nKwangsu was virtually dethroned, and the supreme authority usurped by\r\nthe Empress Dowager, Tsi An. There being, thenceforward, no hope of\r\neffecting the desired arrangement, the Marquis Ito returned to Japan,\r\nsoon after which--namely, on October 31--the homogeneous Ministry which\r\nhad taken office in June of this year--the first Ministry of the kind,\r\nby the way, since the establishment of the Constitution in 1889--was\r\ncompelled to resign, and was succeeded by an eclectic cabinet even\r\nmore thoroughly representative of the Japanese desire to play a great\r\nrôle in the Far East. On November 6, an envoy deputed by the Mikado to\r\npresent certain gifts to the Chinese Emperor insisted upon obtaining\r\nan audience, and thus succeeded in discovering that the unfortunate\r\nKwangsu was still living.\r\n\r\nIt remains to note that the Tokio Foreign Office has at last\r\nsucceeded in inducing the principal Western powers to abolish the\r\nexterritoriality clauses in their respective treaties, whereby their\r\nsubjects were exempted from the jurisdiction of the Japanese tribunals.\r\nWith the disappearance of these clauses, which are still exacted not\r\nonly in the case of China, Siam, Persia and Morocco, but also in the\r\ncase of Turkey and Egypt, the Mikado’s empire may be said to have taken\r\na recognized place among highly civilized nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTWENTIETH CENTURY JAPAN AND THE WAR WITH RUSSIA\r\n\r\n  The Period of Enlightened Rule--The Japanese Imperial\r\n    Family--Semi-Democratic Government--Social and Educational\r\n    Conditions--Religion and Law--Industries and Commerce--European\r\n    Influence--The Agricultural Class--The Greater Japan--Japan and\r\n    Asia--The Leader of Asiatic Countries--Japan’s Development of\r\n    Formosa--Her Influence in Siam--Her Interests in China--Japan\r\n    and the Boxer Movement--Japanese Trade in Manchuria--Japan’s\r\n    Interests in Corea--The Anglo-Japanese Alliance--Japan and the\r\n    United States--Japan and Russia--Russian Interference with Japan in\r\n    Manchuria and Corea--The Diplomatic Game with Russia--Outbreak of\r\n    the Russo-Japanese War--Japan’s Naval and Military Strength--The\r\n    Naval and Military Operations at the Opening of War\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving taken her place as a power on an equality with the great\r\nworld-powers, Japan entered upon the Twentieth Century as the leader\r\nof Asiatic nations in introducing modern civilization. The year\r\n1901, in the Japanese calendar, was called the Meiji Era, or Period\r\nof Enlightened Rule--a fitting name for the first year of the New\r\nEmpire in the new century. The electoral franchise had been extended,\r\nin 1900, to include all excepting certain uneducated persons in the\r\nlowest classes. The country was now divided politically into fifty\r\nPrefectures, Imperial Cities and Territories, in each of which the\r\npeople had a voice in the administration. Consistent with her alliance\r\nwith the great nations of Christendom, and with a constitutional\r\ngovernment, the Japanese people now enjoyed, not only representative\r\ninstitutions, but also local self-government, freedom of the press and\r\nof public meetings, and religious liberty. Behold Twentieth Century\r\nJapan, then, open to any and every religious faith; her people taking\r\npart in the government, and through the Imperial Diet, a representative\r\nbody, wielding a direct influence; the right of petition, assembly,\r\ndiscussion, and publication, free and open; advocating free and\r\nuntrammeled education of her masses; and to the ambitious student\r\nlending a helping hand to the attainment of the highest education.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Imperial family, at the dawn of the twentieth century,\r\nhad severed its connection with all the impracticable and æsthetic\r\ntraditions of 2,600 years; and its members permitted the people now to\r\nlook upon their faces, meeting Japanese subjects face to face, without\r\nfear on either side. Even the Emperor, Mutsuhito, the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-second Mikado in direct descent of the dynasty founded B.C. 660,\r\nis to-day a personage far different from the Mikado of 1804. Instead\r\nof the secluded monarch, whose face was never seen by his subjects,\r\nthe Mikado of 1904 appears in public quite as freely as the King of\r\nEngland or the President of France. Three times a year he reviews his\r\ntroops; he permits foreign visitors to be shown through his palace;\r\nhe receives distinguished foreigners in person; he drives through the\r\nstreets and parks daily. This monarch, not by force or by revolution,\r\nbut voluntarily, surrendered to the people many of his prerogatives.\r\nBy the Mikado, in fact, more than by any statesman or party, Japan was\r\nrecreated.\r\n\r\nAs for the Empress, Her Majesty, more than any Japanese man, is\r\nresponsible for the changed conditions surrounding Japanese womanhood.\r\nToward the close of the nineteenth century she adapted modern ideas to\r\nJapanese customs, in so far as they affected those of her sex. Instead\r\nof being a recluse, a prisoner, virtually a slave, with blackened\r\nteeth and shaved eyebrows, like her predecessor of 1804, the Empress\r\nof 1904 appears frequently in public with her beauty unimpaired. She\r\nencourages, in every practical way, feminine education. She is a patron\r\nof many artistic and philanthropic enterprises and a member of the\r\nInternational Red Cross Society. She is beloved by the people for her\r\nmany good and charitable deeds. Mainly through the influence of the\r\nEmpress, then, the conditions surrounding Japanese women, with the dawn\r\nof the twentieth century, had changed for the better. Formerly, the\r\nJapanese women had no rights whatsoever. A wife was merely an Oriental\r\nchattel--she could be sold or divorced as her husband willed. In\r\n1899, however, rights which her husband was bound to respect, together\r\nwith her legal social status, were defined as follows: “A woman can\r\nnow become the head of a family and exercise authority as such; she\r\ncan inherit and own property and manage it herself; she can exercise\r\nparental authority; she can act as guardian or executor and has a voice\r\nin family councils.”\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince of Japan, Yoshihito--Prince of Haru-no-Miya--who will\r\nsucceed the present Mikado on the throne, followed his father and\r\nmother in the adoption of Western ideas and customs. Though he has\r\nnever traveled outside of Japan, he has ignored the traditions of his\r\ndynasty to an extent unheard of in any other Oriental country. His\r\nattendance at the Nobles School in Tokio marked the beginning of the\r\nnew era in Japanese education. For theretofore the Imperial Princes\r\nwere educated privately within the seclusion of the palace walls. The\r\nCrown Prince, however, recited his lessons with the children of the\r\nnobles and joined them in their games. In May, 1900, the Crown Prince,\r\nthen in his twenty-first year, was married at Haru to the second\r\ndaughter of Prince Kujo. His bride, Princess Sava-Ko, was then in her\r\nnineteenth year. As the future Empress of Japan, she is now receiving\r\nan education that will fit her for the throne.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this mention of the Imperial family, it may be stated that\r\nthe Shogun, meantime, and all that he represented, had passed into\r\nhistory. The last of the Tokugawa dynasty--referred to in a previous\r\nchapter--who abdicated in 1867, was, in 1901, living in retirement in\r\nTokio as a private citizen, riding a bicycle and otherwise evincing\r\npractical approval of the New Japan that had shouldered aside the Old\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nThe new form of government in Japan was declared by statesmen of the\r\nLiberal party to be only semi-democratic. Enlightened Japanese and\r\nstudents of Japan’s development asserted that Japan was hampered rather\r\nthan helped by this semi-democracy, and affirmed that the new order of\r\nthings was a complete disappointment.\r\n\r\n“The representative assembly of Japan, so admirably arranged in\r\ntheory,” wrote United States Senator Beveridge, after a close study of\r\nthe subject, “has more than once proved to be a vexatious interference\r\nwith the far-seeing plans of the empire’s real statesmen. The floors\r\nof the Diet have frequently been made rostrums from which demagogy\r\nhas shouted to the masses--a stage upon which candidates for applause\r\nhave outscreamed one another in playing the rôle of parliamentary\r\nconspicuity.”\r\n\r\nAll such criticism of the new form of government was based on\r\ncomparison with that of European powers whose period of development\r\nincluded centuries, while Japan’s period of advancement covered barely\r\nhalf a century. Against the “disappointment” of students who had been\r\neducated out of Japan, and of “enlightened Japanese” who had traveled\r\nabroad, stood the satisfaction of the great body of people, whose\r\nsource of satisfaction was the comparison of conditions in their\r\ncountry at the beginning of the twentieth century with conditions at\r\nthe opening of the nineteenth century. Conditions in Japan in the\r\nfirst years of the nineteenth century are given in detail in previous\r\nchapters of this work. In comparison with those conditions, it is now\r\nin order to give the most important details of conditions one hundred\r\nyears later. It must be remarked, first, that all Japan’s real advance\r\ntook place during the last third of the nineteenth century, and that\r\nconditions in 1904 were the result, therefore, of the achievements of a\r\nsingle generation. It is not recorded in history that any other nation\r\nadvanced so far in so short a time.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, foreigners, instead of being feared, hated, and excluded\r\nfrom the country, as in 1804, were invited to come to Japan by the\r\nGovernment itself--to teach in Japanese universities, to drill the\r\nJapanese army and navy, to advise in matters of administration, and\r\nto engage in trade. Thousands of foreigners, then, of many different\r\nnationalities, not only traveled in Japan, but resided there. On the\r\nother hand, thousands of Japanese subjects were now seen in all parts\r\nof the world; many were enrolled as students in European and American\r\nuniversities; and many were residing in foreign countries as merchants\r\nand traders. In all the harbors of Japan were seen vessels flying the\r\nflags of many different nationalities; while vessels carrying the\r\nJapanese flag plied regularly between home ports and Asia, America,\r\nEurope, and Australia, conducting freight and passenger service.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, too, the classes below the nobility had been minimized to\r\ntwo--namely, the gentry and the commons. Even in these two classes the\r\ndistinction was nominal. Only in official records, in the exercise of\r\nthe elective franchise and on certain other occasions, were the people\r\nrequired to register their grade in the social or political scale.\r\nAside from the nobility, caste had disappeared. Merit, not rank, was\r\nrewarded in public life; while in private life claim to respect lay in\r\nachievement and education rather than in one’s standing as to class.\r\n\r\nIn education, a suggestion of the broadening process in this\r\nfield--from the mere study of the Japanese and Chinese classics--is\r\ncontained in the statement that one college in Tokio, in its desire\r\nto attract students, took the name “College of One Hundred Branches.”\r\nStudies in Japan now include all Occidental as well as all Oriental\r\nbranches. With the spread of education, with the learning of languages,\r\ncame foreign books. The study of the English language had been made\r\ncompulsory in all schools, and with the advent of the twentieth century\r\nthousands of students had learned also French, German, Spanish, Dutch,\r\nRussian, and Italian. Books in all these languages were imported, and\r\nlibraries throughout Japan now contained as many books in foreign\r\nlanguages as in Japanese. The dead languages, too--Greek, Latin,\r\nHebrew, and Sanskrit--had become part of the curriculum of nearly all\r\nschools and colleges. Formerly, only nobles, priests, and those of the\r\nmilitary classes received an education. Now elementary education was\r\nfree for all, the American school system, with certain modifications,\r\nhaving been put into effect throughout the Empire. Books in many\r\ndifferent foreign languages were also now printed within the Empire, in\r\nprinting-offices equipped with modern type, presses, and appliances.\r\nA large number of magazines were published in Tokio and Yokohama, and\r\nalmost every town had its local newspaper.\r\n\r\nIn religion, Japan in 1904 still remained a Buddhist country, yet\r\nChristianity had 125,000 enrolled believers. With religious freedom\r\ncame Christian ministers, who built Christian churches which were\r\nopenly attended by Christian converts, while a gospel ship cruised in\r\nthe Inland Sea, seeking converts among Japanese sailormen and fishermen.\r\n\r\nJapan began the twentieth century with a system of law and legal\r\nadministration based on European models. The criminal law, for example,\r\nwas based on the Code Napoleon. Trial by jury, however, had not\r\nyet been adopted. There were four courts--namely, Local, District,\r\nAppellate, and Supreme. The judges were appointed by the Emperor and\r\nheld office for life or during good behavior. Certain foreigners\r\nclaimed at this time that a European citizen stood small chance of\r\nreceiving justice in a Japanese court. To refute these charges a\r\nYokohama newspaper, the “Japan Mail,” made an examination of the courts\r\nthere covering a period of six years, with the following result:\r\nNinety-six cases brought by Europeans. In eight a judgment partly in\r\nfavor of each party; compromised and settled thirty-eight. Out of\r\nthe remaining fifty, thirty-six were decided in favor of the foreign\r\nplaintiff and fourteen in favor of the Japanese defendant. These facts\r\nshow that foreigners were treated fairly in, at least, the courts of\r\nYokohama.\r\n\r\nIn the world’s commerce, Japan at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury played so small a part that no record was kept of her exports\r\nor her imports. In the first year of the twentieth century, the figures\r\nfor Japan’s commerce showed $130,000,000 for exports and $140,000,000\r\nfor imports. At this time, next to the soldier, the merchant was the\r\nmost important factor in Japanese society and civilization. Formerly\r\ndespised for trading for profit, the Japanese merchant class now\r\nrepresented the complete change from feudal and æsthetic Japan to\r\ncommercial and democratic Japan. The sword and the barracks were still\r\nfirst in Japanese esteem, but the next highest honors belonged to the\r\nledger and the business office. Behind her new commerce lay Japan’s\r\nnewly developed manufacturing industries. In the gardens of the Prince\r\nof Mito in Tokio was built a national arsenal. And all over the Empire,\r\nJapanese makers of things had built an immense number of manufacturing\r\nplants--engine works, electrical apparatus manufactories, cotton,\r\nwoolen, and paper mills, and iron foundries, dockyards, and shipyards.\r\n\r\nAs for modern means of communication, Japan began the present century\r\nwith four thousand miles of railway, ten thousand miles of telegraph,\r\nand, in the Japanese capital city alone, sixty-five hundred telephones.\r\nTelegraph and telephone bureaus in the Mikado’s palace placed the\r\nEmperor in direct communication with his entire Empire and with the\r\nwhole world. The jinrikisha remained the most popular local conveyance,\r\nprincipally because Japan lacked horses. But there were also\r\nhorse-cars, stages, a few horses, and some carriages, trolley-cars, and\r\nbicycles. In 1904, an electric railway had even invaded Kyoto, once\r\nsacred to the Mikado. Trolley-cars even ran through the ancient domains\r\nof Shogun and Emperor, where once the peasant who even unwittingly\r\nstepped foot was arrested and ultimately beheaded.\r\n\r\nIn the three great necessities--food, clothing, and shelter--Japan\r\nbegan the twentieth century with a modern bill of fare, with European\r\ndress, and with houses built and furnished to some extent in Western\r\nfashion. Once a nation of vegetarians, the Japanese diet now included\r\nanything and everything to eat and drink known in Europe. Many\r\nfamilies employed foreign cooks, and great numbers of the common\r\npeople ate foreign food at least once a day. In 1904, the Empress of\r\nJapan received foreign visitors dressed precisely as were dressed\r\nthe European women in Tokio; that is to say, in the latest Parisian\r\ngowns, with the addition of the latest Parisian millinery. The Emperor,\r\ntoo, abandoned the kimono for trousers and frock coat; at least on\r\npublic occasions. In short, European clothes were as common a sight in\r\nthe streets of the greater cities as native costumes, though in the\r\nrural districts the people still adhered strictly to the costumes of\r\ntheir forefathers. In the matter of houses, the influence of foreign\r\narchitecture was, in 1904, just beginning to be perceptible. Not\r\nthat dwelling-houses were built European style, but that Japanese\r\narchitecture had become somewhat modified by foreign architecture.\r\nBrick and stone were replacing wood in the construction of residences,\r\nstores, and offices. Paper in doors and windows was giving way to\r\nglass; matting for floors was being replaced by rugs. And in rooms\r\nwhere formerly there was not one article of furniture--rooms in which\r\nthe family sat and slept and ate on the floor--there were now European\r\nchairs, bedsteads, and tables. Where once the only light in the\r\nhouse was furnished by a pith-wick floating in vegetable oil, or by\r\nlightning-bugs imprisoned in a bamboo-cage, there were now lamps filled\r\nwith oil from Russia or America, and, in the cities, gas and electric\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nOne class alone, in all Japan at the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, was still of the Japan of old. This was the agricultural\r\nclass. Agriculture was still the chief pursuit of the common people.\r\nThe soil, of volcanic origin, was liberally fertilized, and yielded\r\nimmense harvests. The farms were small, exceeding in few cases more\r\nthan fifteen acres. Upon these few acres, however, a Japanese peasant\r\nsupported himself and his family, and even had something left over\r\nafter paying his tax-bills. The chief products for export were rice,\r\ntea, and silk. It was in the _method_ that farming remained the same\r\nas in years gone by. Very few farmers owned horses; in general, the\r\nfarmers broke the ground with a spade and cultivated it with a hoe. Of\r\nthis class a traveler has said: “Left to the soil to till it, to live\r\nand die upon it, the Japanese farmer has remained the same--with his\r\nhorizon bounded by his rice fields, his water courses, or the timbered\r\nhills, his intellect laid away for safe keeping in the priest’s\r\nhands--caring little who rules him, unless he is taxed beyond the power\r\nof flesh and blood to bear.”\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of the twentieth century, the Japanese promised\r\nto make of their country that which they called Greater Japan. Public\r\nopinion, in 1904, regarding Japan’s immediate future, as summed up by\r\nJapanese statesmen and by Japanese publicists, was as follows: “Japan\r\nis especially favored by nature with beauty and picturesqueness of\r\nscenery and a healthful climate, and has been appropriately called the\r\n‘Paradise of the East.’ We shall turn this country into a grand park\r\nof the nations, and draw pleasure-seekers from all parts of the world.\r\nWe shall build magnificent hotels and establish excellent clubs, in\r\nmost splendid style, to receive the royal visitors of Europe and the\r\nmillionaires of America.\r\n\r\n“To all appearances, the seas about Japan and China will be the\r\nfuture theatre of the Far East. The Philippines have been reduced to\r\na province of the United States. China, separated from us only by a\r\nvery narrow strip of water, is offering every promise of becoming a\r\ngreat resource open to the world of the twentieth century. The Siberia\r\nrailway has been opened to traffic; and the construction of a canal\r\nacross Central America is expected to be finished before long.... As\r\nfor fuel, our supply of coal from the mines of Hokkaido and Kiushiu is\r\nso abundant that the surplus, not required for our own consumption, is\r\nexported largely into various parts of the East, where no productive\r\ncoal mines have been found except a very few ones of poor quality....\r\n\r\n“Taking all these things into account, it is not too much to say that\r\nthe future situation of Japan will be that of a central station of\r\nvarious water passages--a situation most conducive to the good of our\r\ncountry; and that, numerous as the attractive places of historical\r\ninterest and natural beauty are, it is chiefly from our excellently\r\nadvantageous position--a connecting link common to the three chains of\r\nwater passage to and from Europe, America, and Asia--that we shall be\r\nable to obtain the largest share of the riches of the nations of the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nIn the story of Japan’s interests and influence in Asia, in which are\r\ninvolved the events that led to the war with Russia, we will first\r\nexplain the relationship of Japan to Asia from the Japanese viewpoint.\r\nThe substance of the Japanese idea at this time was that the Japanese\r\npeople regarded themselves as the natural leaders in all Asiatic\r\ncountries in the introduction of modern civilization. The Japanese\r\nagreed that the Chinese and Coreans, for example, could learn about\r\ncivilization much faster and easier from Japan than from the countries\r\nin Europe and America, for they had a common system of letters, and\r\nto a certain extent common ideas. A Japanese professor is reported as\r\nsaying: “It is the mission of Japan to set up an example of a civilized\r\nand independent national state for her Asiatic neighbors, and then\r\nto make a confederation of all the Asiatic nations on the basis of\r\ninternational law; just as it is the mission of the United States of\r\nAmerica to form one vast pan-American Union of all the republics of\r\nthe new hemisphere, and thus to hasten on the progress toward the\r\norganization of the whole world.”\r\n\r\nSupplementing which a Japanese editor is quoted as follows: “It is\r\nour duty to transmit the essence of Occidental civilization to our\r\nneighbors, as better success may be realized by so doing than by\r\nintroducing there the new institutions directly from the West. The\r\npresent state of things in China does not allow her to appreciate fully\r\nthe ideas of Westerners, more so because their fundamental conception\r\nof morals is at variance with that of Occidentals. But Japan has\r\nevery facility to win the confidence of China, in consideration of\r\nits geographical situation and of its literary affinity. The valor,\r\ndiscipline, and order of our army have already gained the confidence\r\nand respect of the Chinese, and it now remains for us to guide them\r\nto higher possibilities with enlightened thoughts and ideas. Such\r\na work can not be accomplished in a day; it will require years of\r\nperseverance and toil.”\r\n\r\nAfter this citation of what the Japanese deemed to be their mission\r\nand duty in Asia, let us see what Japan has accomplished in Asiatic\r\nterritory already acquired. Formosa, as stated in the foregoing\r\nchapter, was ceded to Japan by China after the Chino-Japanese War.\r\nIn the first eight years under Japanese rule, the revenue of the new\r\nterritory increased many hundred per cent--from $1,500,000 in 1896\r\nto $12,000,000 in 1903. In 1897, Japan took a complete census of the\r\npopulation, built 800 miles of roads and constructed a tramway line\r\nfrom Takow to Sintek. This was followed by the construction of a main\r\nline of railway between principal cities, which now, in 1904, is open\r\nto passenger and freight traffic. Japan also laid down three cables\r\nconnecting Formosa with Japan, Foo Chow, and the Pesadores. In the\r\ninterior of Formosa, Japan has since established a complete system of\r\nintercommunication by means of 1,500 miles of telegraph and telephone\r\nwires. She has opened over a hundred post-offices in Formosa, and\r\nletters can now be sent to any part of the Empire for two cents each.\r\nShe has established nearly one hundred and fifty Government educational\r\ninstitutions in Formosa, only a few of these being for Japanese,\r\nleaving the majority for natives. Japan has now twelve great Government\r\nhospitals on the island, at which more than 70,000 patients are treated\r\nwithout charge every year. Japan has also given considerable attention\r\nto Formosa in the matter of free vaccination and general sanitary\r\nprecautions, and has consequently greatly reduced the danger from\r\nthe frequent outbreaks of smallpox and the plague. When the Japanese\r\nfirst took possession of Formosa in 1895, the people rose in rebellion\r\nagainst their new rulers. By 1904, however, Japan had restored peace\r\nthroughout the island, a settled government had assumed full control\r\nand the island’s resources were being developed to their fullest extent.\r\n\r\nNow to glance at Japan’s influence in Asiatic countries not under\r\nJapanese rule. First of all, Siam. The Siamese Crown Prince, for\r\nexample, after a visit to Japan, caused a Japanese building to be\r\nconstructed for himself, while the King ordered a Japanese house and\r\ngarden to be added to his palace grounds. Japan is in many ways,\r\nindeed, the teacher and leader of the Siamese. She sends teachers to\r\nSiam, and many Siamese boys and girls, on the other hand, are enrolled\r\nin schools in Japan. Japan also sends seeds of raw materials to be\r\ngrown in Siam, for to Japan Siam has ever represented a source of food\r\nsupply which would remain neutral in war-time. In 1904, Japan reaped\r\nthe benefit from all such influence and teaching and seed supply; for\r\nin that year, with the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan was\r\nable to depend upon Siam for vast reserves in food supplies.\r\n\r\nIn China, the interest of the Japanese, after the Chino-Japanese War,\r\nmultiplied year by year. In 1897, a Japanese consulate was established\r\nat Foo Chow. In that year there were only eight Japanese residents\r\nin Foo Chow; in 1904, the number has increased to three hundred,\r\nincluding natives of Formosa who have become naturalized Japanese. In\r\nAmoy, because of its position directly opposite northern Formosa, the\r\nJapanese have large interests. Further, on the Yangtse River, there are\r\nJapanese lines of passenger steamers, Japanese steamers for the iron\r\nand coal trade, and other Japanese enterprises.\r\n\r\n“Side by side with this development of carrying facilities,” says a\r\ntraveler, “many Japanese, in the capacity of merchants, Government\r\nemployees or projectors, may be seen traveling in the Yangtse\r\nValley; and further the number of persons engaged in the translation\r\nof Japanese books into Chinese has increased in an extraordinary\r\ndegree.... Nothing is more remarkable than the popularity enjoyed by\r\nJapanese things and Japanese subjects in China.”\r\n\r\nThe facts just mentioned typify the growing influence of Japan in\r\nChina at the time of the outbreak of the Boxer Insurrection in 1900.\r\nIt should first be mentioned that in 1900 a General Missionary\r\nConference, attended by delegates from many branches of the Protestant\r\nand Catholic Churches, was held in Tokio. In that same year, when\r\nChristianity was still sending missionaries to Japan to convert the\r\nBuddhists, behold the “heathen” nation allied with the armies of\r\nChristendom in a suppression of the Boxer Movement in the Chinese\r\nEmpire. During that troublous year, the Japanese not only helped to\r\nrescue Christian missionaries and Chinese converts from the fury of\r\nmobs and an uncontrolled soldiery, but those whom they had thus saved\r\nwere transported free of charge to Japan and there given comfortable\r\nrefuge until it was safe to return to China. The principal distinct\r\nevents of historical interest marking Japan’s connection with the\r\nsuppression of the Boxer uprising were as follows: On June 11, the\r\nChancellor of the Japanese Legation at Pekin was murdered by a\r\nChinese mob. On June 17, the Japanese troops, with the allied armies,\r\ncaptured the forts at Taku. On July 13-14, the Japanese, again with\r\nthe allies, took Tien-tsin by storm. On August 14, the Japanese, this\r\ntime with the divisions of the allied armies destined for the relief\r\nof Legations and foreign residents, entered Pekin. September found the\r\nJapanese doing their full share in policing the disturbed districts.\r\nThe Boxer Movement soon after came to an end, and the Chinese Imperial\r\nCourt--which fled from Pekin at the beginning of the trouble--now\r\nreturned to the capital. Altogether, in quelling the disturbances which\r\nhad shocked the world, and particularly in raising the siege of Pekin,\r\nthe Japanese played a brave and conspicuous part which, more than any\r\nof their previous military triumphs, helped to establish their right to\r\na place on an equal footing among the world-powers.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, only twelve months after the events just narrated, Japan’s\r\ntrade in North China, especially in Manchuria, had increased more than\r\nin the twelve years previous to the Boxer uprising. In 1903, Japanese\r\ntrade with Newchwang alone amounted to $8,000,000 and her trade with\r\nall Manchuria to $12,000,000. And, from a commercial viewpoint, other\r\nparts of China as well as Manchuria had become of great importance to\r\nJapan. A partial summary of her achievements in the Chinese Empire at\r\nthe beginning of 1904, by peaceable invasion, by the introduction of\r\nmodern ideas and educational institutions, as given in the “Chinese\r\nRecorder,” includes the following:\r\n\r\n“1. The Agricultural College, established some years ago at Wuchang by\r\nthe Viceroy Chang Chih-tung, and managed for some time by an expert\r\nAmerican, has now been given over to Japanese management.\r\n\r\n“2. The military school in Hangchau is taught wholly by Japanese.\r\n\r\n“3. A large amount of translation work is done by the Japanese.\r\n\r\n“4. Many Chinese students have been sent by Chang Chih-tung during\r\nrecent years to be educated in Japanese schools for Chinese Government\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n“5. Influential Chinese newspapers, owned by Japanese, and advocating\r\ncloser union between the two countries.\r\n\r\n“6. One hundred Japanese students enrolled in the schools at Shanghai,\r\nstudying Chinese and English.\r\n\r\n“7. Formation of societies of Japanese in China to push the circulation\r\nin China of books on Western learning.”\r\n\r\nAt this time, then, every Japanese subject employed in China, in\r\nwhatever capacity, “was a centre diffusing the light of liberalism.”\r\nThe Chinese themselves acknowledged that they were led along their new\r\npath by the Japanese, who “have some degree of distant kinship with the\r\nChinese.” That Japan was doing her duty in the way of helping China\r\nto the benefits of material civilization, that Japan was exerting her\r\ninfluence in China for good on high planes, is shown in the words of\r\nthe most eminent Chinese scholar in America, Dr. Hirth, professor of\r\nChinese in Columbia University, New York City. Said he: “No capable\r\nobserver of events in China since the Imperial Court returned to Pekin\r\ncan doubt that the Government has decided to adopt the policy of\r\nJapan, which is to take the methods of Western civilization for their\r\nmodels. In directing the new movement in China, Japan is taking the\r\nlead over other foreign nations, and this, it is asserted, is due to\r\nher superior command of the language.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, every educated Japanese is imbued with the ideas prevalent\r\nin Chinese literature, religious and political, and hence he has a\r\ndifferent standing in the eyes of the Chinese from that of Americans\r\nand Europeans. China has thus placed the work of educating the rising\r\ngeneration in the hands of the Japanese as being less likely to destroy\r\nthe old knowledge while familiarizing the students with the advantages\r\nof the new.\r\n\r\n“A National university has been established by the Emperor at Pekin,\r\nwhich it is calculated will be the model for educational institutions\r\nall over the country. Recently a Japanese professor has been selected\r\nto draft a new code of laws for the Empire. The reason why a Japanese\r\nwas selected for this work in preference to an equally learned German,\r\nAmerican, or Englishman, is because men who are both willing and\r\ncapable of making due allowance for traditional prejudices will never\r\narise from a country where the study of Chinese institutions is so much\r\nin its infancy as with all of us, except Japan.”\r\n\r\nAfter the above consideration of Japan’s leadership in Formosa, Siam,\r\nand China, including Manchuria, there remain the facts relating to\r\nJapan’s most important interests in Corea. In the latter country,\r\nJapanese influence, at the beginning of 1904, was felt even more widely\r\nand more potently than in any other part of Asia. In Corea, on January\r\n1, 1904, there were more than twenty thousand Japanese subjects. These\r\nmanaged practically all the important commercial and educational\r\nenterprises in the kingdom. By far the largest part of Corea’s foreign\r\ntrade--with respect to both imports and exports--was with Japan. Corea\r\nsent agricultural products to Japan, and imported Japanese manufactured\r\ngoods. Japan also virtually controlled Corea’s means of communication\r\nwith foreign countries; for the postal and telegraph offices in every\r\nopen port in the kingdom were in the hands of the Japanese. All Corea’s\r\ncoasting trade, also, was carried on by Japanese vessels; for Corea\r\nherself had only an insignificant merchant marine. Practically all the\r\nrailways were controlled by the Japanese who had built them. Every bank\r\nof good standing was managed by Japanese. The fisheries and mining\r\nindustries were conducted almost entirely by subjects of the Mikado.\r\nAltogether, all the greatest business enterprises, of whatsoever nature\r\nthroughout the kingdom, were conducted by the Japanese. In short, the\r\nJapanese represented the employers of Corea, while the subjects of the\r\nCorean king composed the great body of employees.\r\n\r\nSo great were Japanese interests in China and Corea, that the question\r\nof the integrity of those countries, with “open doors,” had become of\r\nvital importance to the Island Empire. To secure both integrity and\r\n“open doors,” Japan utilized the full power of her diplomatic genius to\r\nobtain an alliance with Great Britain. Her endeavors in this direction\r\nwere highly successful. On February 12, 1902, was formed the historical\r\nAnglo-Japanese Alliance to preserve the integrity of China and the\r\nindependence of Corea. What led to this greatest political event in\r\n1902? this first alliance in history between a white nation and a\r\nyellow nation? What induced England to abandon her traditional policy\r\nof “splendid isolation”? Why did England break that policy for the\r\nfirst time in many decades to ally herself with an Oriental rather than\r\nan Occidental power? It is to be noted here that Japan at this time\r\ncalled herself the England of the East, one historian--Diosy--referring\r\nto the matter thus: “Japan, geographically to the mighty continent of\r\nAsia what Great Britain is to the continent of Europe; Japan, an island\r\npeople with all the strength, mental and physical, that is the heritage\r\nof a nation cradled on the sea; Japan, by the necessities of her\r\nenvironment compelled to appreciate the importance of sea-power; Japan,\r\nin short, the Britain of the Orient.”\r\n\r\nJapan’s first opportunity to back up this view of herself, by concrete\r\ndemonstration, was furnished by the Boxer Movement in China. Even\r\nthen, in 1900, Japan had in mind an alliance with Great Britain; and\r\nnow she determined to make the best possible showing. So thoroughly,\r\naccordingly, did she display her military and naval efficiency, so\r\nrepeatedly did her troops win laurels side by side with European\r\ntroops, that England was greatly impressed. It was by her triumph\r\nduring the Boxer uprising, indeed, that Japan confirmed her claim\r\nto recognition as a world power--a claim recognized by the powers\r\nin 1899, but not reaching full completion until the signing of the\r\nAnglo-Japanese Convention in 1902.\r\n\r\nSecond, the alliance was said to be the result of a natural community\r\nof British and Japanese interests in the East; that the two countries\r\nwere now allies in fact, while formerly they had only been allies in\r\nspirit; that Japan and England had similar sympathies and similar\r\npolicies in the East; and that therefore the convention was entirely\r\nvoluntary, spontaneous, and natural.\r\n\r\nThird, the alliance was popularly supposed to include the two greatest\r\nnaval powers in the world, and as such it was said to represent a\r\nguarantee of peace in the Orient, and of fairness in all matters\r\nrelating to China and Corea. A Japanese official, in his exaltation,\r\nsaid: “There is no power or combination of powers that could make head\r\nagainst this union in the Far East; the attempt would be like spitting\r\nat a tiger.”\r\n\r\nThe signing of the convention met with popular disapproval in England;\r\nbut it was the occasion of great rejoicing in Japan. In every province\r\nin the Mikado’s empire feasts were held, the celebration being\r\ncontinued over a period of ten days.\r\n\r\nOne significant phase of public opinion regarding the alliance, was\r\nthat to all intents and purposes it would include the United States\r\nas a “silent partner.” An American historian, Ernest W. Clement, in\r\nhis “Hand Book of Modern Japan,” wrote: “It is well known that the\r\nconvention was shown at Washington before it was promulgated, and that\r\nit was heartily approved by our Government. Practically, therefore,\r\nit is, in a very broad sense, an Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Certainly\r\nour interests in the Far East have been and are identical with those\r\nof Great Britain and Japan; and all our ‘moral influence,’ at least,\r\nshould be exerted toward the purposes of that convention. Indeed, the\r\nAnglo-Japanese Alliance should mean the union of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States with Japan to maintain in the Orient the ‘open door,’ not\r\nmerely of trade and commerce, but of all social, intellectual, moral,\r\nand religious reforms; the open door, not of material civilization\r\nonly, but also of the gospel of Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nIt was natural that Japan should be eager for American assistance. When\r\nevents foretold the coming war between Russia and Japan, the influence\r\nof the United States in international councils was so great that, as an\r\nally, she would have been welcomed by Japan, of course. Until the exact\r\nposition which the United States would take in regard to affairs in the\r\nFar East was known Japan was nervous; for Japan understood that the\r\npolicy of Great Britain as well as that of France and Germany would be\r\ngoverned to some extent by that of America. As a government, however,\r\nthe government would take no part in the coming war, principally\r\nbecause the government, for the present, at least, could not see\r\nwherein American interests would be threatened. However, Japan asked\r\nthe question pointblank: Would the United States assist Japan? The\r\nanswer was an emphatic but courteous “No.”\r\n\r\nWith the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Convention began the\r\nseventh great period in the Japan of the nineteenth and twentieth\r\ncenturies--the period of Cosmopolitanism. Japan was no longer native\r\nJapan, or Asiatic Japan; she was now Cosmopolitan Japan. The sixth\r\nprevious periods were:\r\n\r\nI. Seclusion (1801-1853). II. Treaty-making (1854-1858). III. Civil\r\nCommotions (1858-1868). IV. Reconstruction (1868-1878). V. Internal\r\nDevelopment (1879-1889). VI. Constitutional Government (1889-1904).\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Japanese Alliance was presumably a proof that both the\r\nnations signing the convention regarded the presence of Russian\r\ntroops in Manchuria and Russian aggression in the East generally as a\r\ngenuine, threatening, and immediate source of danger--danger to British\r\nand Japanese trade. The facts concerning Russia’s interference with\r\nJapan were these: The Russian military forces which were stationed\r\nthroughout Manchuria, in 1900, to suppress the Boxer Movement, had\r\nremained on Manchurian soil. In 1901, Japan and other European powers\r\nbegan pressing the Pekin Government to order the Russian forces out\r\nof Manchuria. Finally, on April 8, 1902, Russia and China signed a\r\nconvention at Pekin, wherein Russia agreed to evacuate Manchuria by the\r\n8th of October. In the meantime, however, through astute diplomatic\r\nprocedure on the part of Russia, the Convention of April 8th “lapsed,”\r\nand on October 8th, consequently, there was as great a number of\r\nRussian troops in Manchuria as on April 8th. It was the “lapse” of the\r\nConvention of April 8th that aroused the Japanese nation to the fact\r\nthat she would have to deal sternly with Russia; else Russia, secure\r\nin Manchuria, would assume a like position in Corea, and thus prepare\r\nthe way for Russian armed invasion of Japan. A Japanese statesman\r\nreferred to Corea at this time as “an arrow with the point aimed at our\r\nheart.” “The absorption of Manchuria by the Russians,” continued the\r\nstatesman, “renders the position of Corea precarious. Corea is life or\r\ndeath to Japan. For the safety of my country I insist that it shall\r\nbecome Japanese, and upon that insistence every subject of the Mikado\r\nis willing to lay down his life.”\r\n\r\nCorea represented for Japan, indeed, a territorial outlet for her\r\nalready congested population. Still further, Japan feared for her\r\nenormous material interest in Corea--her railways, banks, and trade,\r\nalready mentioned. Russia’s interest in Corea, at the same time, lay\r\nin the fact that in Corea, as in Manchuria, were ice-free ports, or\r\ndoors for the great cage called the Russian Empire. With the Russians\r\nin Manchuria, Japan’s vast interests in Corea were believed to be so\r\nseriously imperiled that Japanese diplomats in St. Petersburg were\r\nordered to insist to the end upon the evacuation by the Russians of\r\nManchuria.\r\n\r\nTo all the representations of the Japanese Government, the Russian\r\nGovernment gave no heed, but proceeded with her railroad construction\r\nand her colonization in Manchuria, regardless of Japanese protestation.\r\nOn May 8, 1903, the largest Russian force that had entered China since\r\n1900 occupied the province of Newchwang, Manchuria. And on October 29,\r\n1903, the Russian troops entered Mukden, Manchuria, and established\r\nthere a military base. From that day onward, both countries understood\r\nthat war was inevitable, both sides prepared for the conflict. In the\r\ncoming struggle Russia counted upon the assistance, if needed, of\r\nFrance, with whom she had formed an alliance similar to that of Japan’s\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February, 1904, the prolonged tension between the two\r\ncountries reached a climax. Diplomatic notes had been exchanged in\r\nvain; diplomacy had done all it could. At a Cabinet conference in\r\nTokio, hope of peace was practically abandoned, for the reason that\r\nwhile Russia was unreasonably delaying her reply to the last Japanese\r\nnote, she was daily increasing her warlike activities. When this\r\nlong-awaited Russian document was sent to the Russian Minister at\r\nTokio, it was never delivered. It was known in advance that Russia\r\npartly conceded the demand of Japan in Corea, but would not place\r\nherself on record as recognizing the sovereignty of China in Manchuria.\r\nNor would Russia even discuss these questions with Japan. On Saturday,\r\nFebruary 6th, at four o’clock in the afternoon, M. Kurino, the Japanese\r\nMinister at St. Petersburg, called personally to inform the Russian\r\nGovernment that in view of the futility of negotiations Japan deemed\r\nit useless to continue diplomatic relations, and that Japan would take\r\nsuch steps as she deemed proper for the protection of her interests.\r\nThereupon M. Kurino asked for his passports. A few hours later the\r\nRussian Minister to Japan prepared to leave the Island Empire.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later, forty Japanese transports were loaded with\r\ntroops to be landed at various points in Corea. A naval division sailed\r\nfrom Japanese waters for Chemulpo and another for Port Arthur, and the\r\nfirst landing force was disembarked at Masanpo, Corea. It was to be a\r\nwar for mastery on the Continental shore of Asia, and Japan invited the\r\nwar with open defiance.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the story of hostilities, it may be well to give\r\nthe facts concerning Japan’s naval and military strength. Her naval\r\nstrength had for several years been such that European nations\r\nmarveled. Joseph Chamberlain, England’s Colonial Secretary, had\r\nsaid of Japan’s navy: “Any foreign power that should venture to\r\nattack Japan in her own waters would be strangely advised.” With her\r\nsplendidly equipped arsenals and dockyards, with her abundant supply\r\nof coal, with the number and fighting strength of her ships, with\r\nthe proved efficiency of her naval officers, with her perfection of\r\nnaval organization, with the _esprit de corps_ of the personnel of\r\nher navy--Japan at the beginning of 1904 was indeed a naval power\r\nwhich any European country might respect. Of this naval power Arthur\r\nDiosy, in the “New Far East,” said: “Japan possesses all the elements\r\nof sea-power: swift, powerful ships, adapted to the work they are\r\nintended for, numerous good harbors, excellent coal in abundance,\r\ncapital facilities for the repair of her vessels, and the necessary\r\nplant, constantly augmented and improved, for building new ones. Her\r\nnaval organization is wise and efficient, her administrative services\r\nare thorough and honest; her naval officers are gallant, dashing, and\r\nscientifically trained, and the armament they control is of the latest\r\nand best pattern. Strong in ships, strong in guns, Japan is stronger\r\nstill in the factor without which ships and guns are useless--‘the Man\r\nbehind the Gun.’”\r\n\r\nAs for her military strength, Japan’s army was conceded by military\r\nauthorities to be the finest “land fighting machine” east of Germany.\r\n“Their tactics,” wrote Senator Beveridge, in his “Russian Advance,”\r\n“are almost wholly German, even to the artificial and exhausting ‘goose\r\nstep’ on parade. Indeed, the Japanese army is a perfect machine, built\r\non the German model, but perfected at minute points and in exquisite\r\ndetail with the peculiar ability of the Japanese for diminutive\r\naccuracy and completeness. The Japanese army, regiment, company, is\r\n‘built like a watch,’ and each Japanese soldier is a part of this\r\nmachine, like a screw or spring or disk, with this exception--every\r\nsoldier is capable of being transformed into another part of this\r\ncomplex yet simple mechanism.”\r\n\r\nAt midnight, Monday, February 8, the first shot in the war was fired.\r\nWaiving entirely the formality of a declaration of war, Japan ordered\r\nher finest fleet, under Admiral Togo, to Port Arthur. There, in the\r\nouter harbor, the fleet suddenly appeared and sent in a flotilla of\r\ntorpedo-boats to attack the Russian warships which lay at anchor\r\nunder the guns of the forts. For this unexpected attack the Russians\r\nwere ill-prepared. Many of the officers of the ships were ashore at\r\nplaces of amusement. None of the Russian ships was even stripped for\r\naction. With the onslaught of the torpedo-boats, therefore, the Russian\r\nfleet, under Admiral Stark, was thrown into the utmost confusion.\r\nDefeat ensued. Two Russian first-class battleships were torpedoed and\r\nbeached, and a Russian cruiser was torpedoed and sunk. The Japanese\r\ntorpedo-boats escaped unharmed. In this attack, the Russians reported\r\ntwo men killed and thirteen wounded. The Japanese reported no losses.\r\n\r\nRussia at the time claimed treachery on the part of Japan for attacking\r\nher ships prior to a declaration of war. Experts on international law,\r\nhowever, agreed that under circumstances such as then existed either\r\nnation might attack as Japan did. All diplomatic relations had ceased,\r\naffairs had reached an acute stage, each country was preparing for war,\r\nand the experts declared that it was unnecessary for either country to\r\nawait a declaration of war before striking the blow.\r\n\r\nThe next day, February 9, the Japanese fleet of sixteen vessels\r\nreturned to Port Arthur and opened a bombardment on the Russian ships\r\nand forts. The Russian return-fire was ineffectual. During this\r\nbombardment one Russian battleship and three cruisers were damaged\r\nbelow the water line. The Russian commanders also reported two officers\r\nand fifty-one men wounded, and nine killed.\r\n\r\nThat same day, February 9, a division of the Japanese fleet consisting\r\nof three cruisers, four gunboats, and eight torpedo craft, under the\r\ncommand of Admiral Uriu, approached the harbor of Chemulpo, Corea.\r\nTwo Russian cruisers, one of them the _Variag_, of the first class,\r\nthe other an inconsiderable fighting unit, the _Korietz_, were given\r\nuntil noon to come out of the neutral port. In the harbor were French,\r\nBritish, Italian, and American cruisers, whose crews cheered the craft\r\nto sea like the crowds at a football game. Four miles out the battle\r\nbegan. The Russians were smothered by weight of metal, and after being\r\ncrippled and set on fire, crawled back to the harbor where they blew\r\nup and sank. The _Variag_ lost 30 men and 7 officers killed and 42\r\nwounded, while the Japanese reported no losses.\r\n\r\nAltogether in these first engagements of the war, ten Russian ships\r\nwere put out of action, while the Japanese vessels suffered little\r\ndamage and reported no loss of life. The best ships of the Russian\r\nfleet were now out of the problem of attack against Japan; and Japan\r\nfelt free to pour her troops into Corea.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Togo, however, continued to blockade and harass Port Arthur, at\r\nthe same time sending a small squadron to hover off Vladivostok, and\r\nhold in check the Russian cruisers there. The Japanese control of the\r\nsea was so complete by this time that preparations were made to resume\r\nthe mail steamer service between Shanghai and Japanese ports without\r\nconvoy, and to return several of the liners, which had been taken as\r\nauxiliary cruisers, to their regular runs across the Pacific and to\r\nAustralia. Such were, in brief, the naval operations during the first\r\nmonth of the war.\r\n\r\nThe land operations of the same period included no engagements that\r\nmight be called battles. The Japanese landed twenty thousand men on\r\nRussian territory, south of Vladivostok; and a similar number of men\r\nhad been landed on the east coast of Corea. Thus Japan began a flank\r\nmovement, whose objective was the isolation of Vladivostok; while\r\nat the same time other troops advanced toward Harbin, in Manchuria,\r\nwhere the Russians occupied a strategic position. During this time the\r\nRussian and Japanese outposts clashed repeatedly near Ping-yang in\r\nnorthern Corea. On March 1st, the Japanese General Staff left Japan for\r\nCorea, and a few days later the landing and the mobilization of the\r\nJapanese army in Corea was complete.\r\n\r\nIn the first week in March, Japan announced that a treaty had been\r\nmade with Corea which recognized the entity of that kingdom, included\r\nguarantees against absorption by Japan or Russia, and virtually\r\nestablished a protectorate, such as England held in Egypt. Corea became\r\nan ally of Japan by the terms of this treaty.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first month of the war both combatants had settled\r\ndown to the most thorough preliminary campaign, for the establishment\r\nof bases and lines of communication, before their armies swung into\r\nbattle line. Such was the war situation in the Far East in March, 1904,\r\nwhen throughout the world it was feared that the Russo-Japanese War\r\nwould end in a world war, or in a conflict involving, at least, Japan’s\r\nally, England, and Russia’s ally, France. Friends of the Japanese put\r\nthe matter thus: “Russia and Japan can not both breathe freely in the\r\nOrient. One or the other must be cramped in opportunity and warped in\r\ndevelopment. Each is acting upon the law of self-preservation, not as\r\na pretext, but as an immediate, pressing necessity. If Russia wins,\r\nEurope becomes rapidly more like Asia. If Japan is the victor, the\r\ncontinent of so many glories may have a future of its own.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE WAR WITH RUSSIA, AND JAPAN A WORLD POWER\r\n\r\n  War Operations on Land--Four Great Japanese Armies in the\r\n    Field--The Siege and Capitulation of Port Arthur--Operations of\r\n    the Navy--The Annihilation of the Russian Fleet--Terms of the\r\n    Treaty of Portsmouth--Treaty of Alliance with England--Financial\r\n    Troubles in Japan and Riotous Demonstrations against the\r\n    Government--Supplementary Treaty with Russia--Government Control in\r\n    Corea Transferred to Japan--Abdication of the Corean Emperor and\r\n    a Japanese Resident-General Appointed--Attacks on Japanese on the\r\n    United States Pacific Coast--General Arbitration Treaty with the\r\n    United States\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the striking of the first blows to check Russia’s advance, Japan\r\nat once became master of the situation in the Far East and remained\r\nmaster till the end of the war through repeated victories on land and\r\nsea. Japanese progress and expansion had been imperiled by Russia’s\r\noccupation of Manchuria and by Russian aggression in Corea, these two\r\ncountries being the very territory needed by Japan for her overflowing\r\npopulation. Therefore, behind national pride in the splendid\r\nachievements of the Japanese army and navy, was national instinct\r\nof self-preservation. Corea and Manchuria were to Japan national\r\nnecessities; and so Japan began ridding herself of the menace of Russia\r\nin territory that the Japanese regarded as being logically their own\r\nsphere of influence. Japan won; and, by reason of victory, became a\r\nworld power, to dominate in the East for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe last week of February, 1904, found General Kuroki, commanding the\r\nJapanese First Army in the East, with his forces concentrated along\r\nthe Yalu River that separates Corea from Manchuria. General Kuroki had\r\nalready occupied Ping Yang, and now was ready to begin the forward\r\nmovement against the Russian army under General Kuropatkin.\r\n\r\nMarch and April witnessed the steady advance of the Japanese First\r\nArmy, Kuroki having crossed the Yalu River with three divisions\r\nto attack divisions of Kuropatkin’s army under General Sassulitch\r\nand others. On May 1st, the first serious blow was struck, at\r\nKiu-lien-cheng, when Kuroki drove the Russians out of that place. The\r\nJapanese immediately followed up this victory with another--driving the\r\nRussians from their position north of Kiu-lien-cheng, to which they had\r\nretreated. The losses in these two engagements were (officially) 2,397\r\nofficers and men of the Russian forces; and (unofficially) 800 officers\r\nand men of the Japanese army.\r\n\r\nOn May 7th, Kuroki captured another town, Feng-wang-cheng, the Russians\r\nretreating without giving battle. The first setback to the Japanese\r\nin the war came with defeat in an engagement with Cossacks north of\r\nFeng-wang-cheng, May 18th.\r\n\r\nEight days later (May 26), however, the almost monotonous succession\r\nof victories that characterized the movement of the Japanese armies\r\nthroughout the war was resumed with a victory at the great battle of\r\nKinchow and Nanchan Hill. This was the first really notable pitched\r\nbattle of the war. After sixteen hours of continuous fighting, the\r\nRussians began a precipitous retreat, pursued by the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe casualties on both sides were very heavy, those of Japan being\r\nestimated at between 3,500 and 4,300 killed and wounded. The Russians\r\nleft 704 dead on the field at Nanshan Hill alone--the bodies being\r\nburied by the Japanese some two weeks later (June 12). Altogether\r\nthe Russian total loss in killed and wounded was 2,600. The Japanese\r\nreported the capture (during the Kinchow and Nanshan Hill engagements\r\nand in the minor engagements that were taking place simultaneously), of\r\n600 prisoners, 21 guns, 1,000 rifles, and 350,000 rounds of ammunition.\r\nThis great victory was the first of the many to be celebrated in Japan\r\nwith joyful popular demonstrations.\r\n\r\nOn May 30th, the Japanese attacked and defeated 2,000 Cossacks at\r\nAi-pien-men; and on the same day, General Oku, commanding the Japanese\r\nSecond Army, reported to his Government that he had occupied the port\r\nof Dalny, which the Russians had evacuated after destroying a large\r\npart of the town. General Oku reported, however, that the docks, piers,\r\nand railroad station, were not seriously damaged.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile (May 23 to 26), the Japanese Third Army, under General Nodzu,\r\nengaged in a series of battles with the Russian forces (under General\r\nFock) which General Stoessel had sent out from Port Arthur to attempt\r\nto restore the line of communication between the besieged city and\r\nMukden.\r\n\r\nFifty thousand men of General Oku’s Second Army caught a large body\r\nof Russians under General Stakelberg in ambush, near Telissu, on June\r\n14th, and a battle ensued in which the Russians lost 4,300 men and\r\nthe Japanese 1,100. Thus the Japanese thwarted one more attempt of\r\nthe Russians to move to the relief of Port Arthur, General Stakelberg\r\nhaving concentrated his troops on the line of railroad leading to\r\nthe besieged city. The Russians now fell back upon Kaiping, but the\r\nJapanese drove them from that position, July 9th. Meantime, the Third\r\nArmy under General Nodzu had effected a junction with Kuroki, and\r\ntogether the two armies advanced to Sunachen and there again defeated\r\nthe Russians, after a two hours’ battle. A Fourth Japanese Army had\r\ntaken the field, and Field Marshal Oyama was placed in supreme command\r\nof all Japanese operations.\r\n\r\nNow came another notable defeat of the Russians. In a desperate attempt\r\nto prevent the separation of their forces, 20,000 Russians, under\r\nGeneral Keller, unsuccessfully attacked the Japanese at Fenshiuling\r\n(July 17), and then retired to a strong position on the Yantze Pass. On\r\nJuly 23d, General Oku advanced to the attack on Yinkow, and compelled\r\nthe Russians to abandon the place. Furthermore, on July 31st, the\r\nJapanese, after a desperate fight, drove the Russians under General\r\nKeller from their position on Yantze Pass. General Keller was killed\r\nand his men fell back to Liaoyang. Simultaneously, Generals Oku and\r\nNodzu combined in an attack on the Russians at Haicheng (August 2),\r\ncompelling the enemy to evacuate that place also. Thus with a loss of\r\n2,400 men, the Japanese had within a few days driven the enemy back\r\nfrom the mountains into the Manchu Plains.\r\n\r\nWith 200,000 men the Japanese then renewed the attack on the Russians\r\n(who had 148,000 men), at Liaoyang. The First, Second and Third Armies\r\nbegan a general advance (August 26), and continued to push forward\r\ntill September 3d, when the Russians were driven out of Liaoyang and\r\ncompelled to retreat toward Mukden. By September 5th the Russian forces\r\nunder General Kuropatkin were practically surrounded by the Japanese.\r\n\r\nIn October occurred one of the greatest battles of the war, that of\r\nthe Sha River and Lone Tree Hill. This time the Russians took the\r\noffensive, advancing, 300,000 strong, upon the Japanese battle line\r\nalong the Sha River. For a week, fighting night and day, the battle\r\ncontinued, the Japanese losing their commanding position on Lone Tree\r\nHill. This battle also checked the Japanese advance and ended the\r\ncampaign for the fall and winter. In this seven days’ fight each side\r\nlost about 45,000 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nFighting was resumed on January 25, 1905, when the Russians again\r\ntook the initiative, General Kuropatkin, with 400,000 men, ordering\r\na general attack on the enemy near Liaoyang. For six days the battle\r\nlasted, with desperate fighting on both sides, but resulting in the\r\nrepulse of the Russians. Then, from February 20th to March 15th, was\r\nfought the series of terrific engagements known as the battle of\r\nMukden. Field Marshal Oyama’s four armies, consisting of 500,000 men,\r\nextending in line-of-battle over a semicircle 120 miles long, advanced\r\nin a general attack which resulted in the taking of Mukden on March\r\n10th and the demoralized retreat of the Russians, March 15th. In these\r\noperations the Japanese lost 60,000 men, the Russians 100,000.\r\n\r\nAt Port Arthur the siege continued with a number of aggressive\r\nmovements by the Japanese who, by assault, began taking the inner\r\nforts on August 21st. Ten days later a general assault, directed by\r\nGeneral Nogi, was made on the city, but was repulsed. On September 24th\r\nthe Japanese captured the forts commanding the water supply of the\r\ncity. On November 4th, the Japanese took Wantai Hill, and on November\r\n30th captured 203-Metre Hill commanding city and harbor. Fight after\r\nfight took place until January 2, 1905, when the capitulation of the\r\ncity became an accomplished fact, General Stoessel surrendering to\r\nGeneral Nogi. After this most notable siege of modern history, in which\r\nthe Japanese gained the richest prize of the war (Port Arthur being the\r\nkey to the situation on land), the reckoning showed that the Japanese\r\nlost three times as many men as the enemy--45,000 on the Japanese side,\r\nwhile the Russian losses were only 15,000.\r\n\r\nOn the sea, at the same time, Japanese operations resulted in still\r\nmore brilliant victories. On April 13, 1904, the Russian battleship\r\n_Petropavlovsk_, returning to Port Arthur harbor with Admiral Makaroff\r\non board, struck a mine (or possibly a torpedo), and sank, the Russian\r\nadmiral and 600 of the crew of the battleship losing their lives.\r\nIn May the Japanese bombarded Vladivostok, and, by sinking merchant\r\nvessels at the entrance to Port Arthur harbor, attempted to bottle up\r\nthe Russian squadron. On May 11th the Japanese lost a cruiser that was\r\ntorpedoed off Port Arthur; and on the 17th lost two more warships, one\r\nby a mine and the other by collision. Naval fights occurred during the\r\nsummer and fall, usually with decided success for the ships of the\r\nMikado. On December 6th, having captured 203-Metre Hill, the Japanese\r\nshelled the Russian fleet in the harbor, sinking a turret-ship and a\r\nbattleship, and seriously damaging other vessels, thus rendering Russia\r\nhelpless in naval operations in those waters.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Russian Baltic Sea fleet, under Admiral Rojestvensky,\r\nwas on the way to the East; and upon this fleet now were centred all\r\nRussian hopes of regaining even partial control on the Far Eastern\r\nseas. But Admiral Togo, commanding the Japanese naval forces, was\r\nlying in wait off Tsu Island, in the east channel of Corea Strait,\r\nand no sooner did Rojestvensky’s fleet arrive (after junction with a\r\nsmaller squadron under Admiral Nebogatoff) than Togo steamed forward\r\nto deliver a crushing blow that was to end the war and to bring Togo\r\neverlasting fame. Togo signaled to his vessels: “The destiny of our\r\nEmpire depends upon this action. You are all expected to do your\r\nutmost.” That was at noon, May 27, 1905. All that afternoon and all\r\nthe following day the fighting continued, resulting in the practical\r\nannihilation of the Russian fleet--all the best remaining ships of\r\nthe Russian navy being sunk. Admiral Rojestvensky was taken prisoner;\r\nAdmiral Nebogatoff surrendered his squadron. Admiral Togo sank six\r\nbattleships, six cruisers, a coast-defense vessel, a repair ship, and\r\na number of destroyers, while on his own very slightly damaged vessels\r\nthere were less than 1,000 casualties.\r\n\r\nTen days later (June 8, 1905), Theodore Roosevelt, President of the\r\nUnited States, intervened to end the war. Addressing the Japanese and\r\nRussian Governments, Mr. Roosevelt urged immediate and direct peace\r\nnegotiations and offered his friendly services. Both the belligerent\r\nnations accepted the President’s offer (June 12) and plenipotentiaries\r\nwere at once appointed to discuss the terms of peace. Baron Komura\r\nand Mr. Takahira representing Japan, and Baron Rosen and Count Witte\r\nrepresenting Russia, were introduced to one another on the President’s\r\nyacht, _Mayflower_, at Oyster Bay, Long Island, August 5th. The envoys\r\nwere then conveyed to the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where\r\nthe sessions of the peace conference continued for thirty days, the\r\nTreaty of Portsmouth being signed on September 5th.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this treaty, Japan secured from Russia “not one kopek,”\r\nas Count Witte expressed it, for war indemnity. Japan gained, however,\r\na recognition of her preponderant influence in Corea and an agreement\r\nby Russia to evacuate Manchuria and to return to China the civil\r\nadministration of Manchurian territory. Also Japan acquired Russia’s\r\nleasehold of Port Arthur, the holding of all military works at Port\r\nArthur and Dalny, and the control of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\r\nFinally, Japan secured from Russia the cession of one-half of the\r\nisland of Sakhalin, Japan taking the half nearest to her own islands\r\n(the southern half) while Russia retained the northern half.\r\n\r\nThese terms, however, wore unsatisfactory to the Japanese\r\npeople--especially the failure to secure any indemnity--the people\r\nfeeling that they should have received more for their sacrifices made\r\nduring the war. Riotous demonstrations against the Government broke out\r\nin Tokio and elsewhere, but were quelled after the placing of Tokio\r\nunder martial law.\r\n\r\nIn the reckoning of grand totals of forces engaged and men lost in\r\nthe war, it was estimated that Japan had over 1,200,000 troops in the\r\nfield, and that her losses in killed and wounded, and from disease,\r\namounted to 370,000. Russia had only 870,000 men actually in the field,\r\nthough her available force in the East was over 1,000,000 men. Russian\r\nfield casualties were estimated at 350,000.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, Japan\r\nrenewed her Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain (September 27, 1905),\r\nto remain in force for ten years. By the terms of this treaty both\r\ncountries agreed to maintain peace in Eastern Asia and India and to\r\nrespect the integrity of China; England agreed, also, to recognize\r\nJapan’s paramount political, military, and economic interests in Corea.\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 1905, the Emperor of Japan opened the first Diet\r\nfollowing the war and the new Alliance Treaty with England, referring\r\nin his speech to the fact that Japan had become a world power and that\r\nit was the duty of Parliament and of all citizens to assist to the\r\nutmost in fulfilling the country’s newly acquired obligations.\r\n\r\nA new Cabinet was then formed with Marquis Saionji as Premier. Through\r\nthe two years following, during which the Marquis was in power, the\r\ncountry was agitated by a succession of popular demonstrations against\r\nthe Government, the people declaring that the nation’s finances were\r\nnot properly administered and that taxation had increased “beyond\r\ntolerance.” The crisis in the financial situation was reached on\r\nJanuary 14, 1908, when Marquis Saionji tendered his resignation, only\r\nto have it refused by the Emperor, his Majesty asserting that the\r\nPremier’s policies possessed his entire confidence.\r\n\r\nOn January 19th, the Progressive Party of Japan adopted a platform\r\nattacking the Cabinet for “bad finance and weak diplomacy.” And as late\r\nas March 21, 1908, figures presented to the House of Peers showed the\r\nnecessity for an increase in taxes to meet deficits. This additional\r\ndrain on the popular pocketbook resulted in disturbances and even\r\nsanguinary riots in May of 1908.\r\n\r\nA supplementary treaty with Russia, known as the Russo-Japanese\r\nConvention, signed July 30, 1907, strengthened the diplomatic\r\nfriendship that was re-established between Japan and her erstwhile\r\nenemy by the Treaty of Portsmouth. By the terms of the new Convention,\r\nthe contracting nations agreed each to respect the existing territorial\r\nintegrity of the other. Both recognized the independence and\r\nterritorial integrity of China and the principle of equal opportunities\r\nin commerce and industry of all nations in the Chinese Empire. Also the\r\nConvention provided for a linking of the Japanese and Russian railways\r\nin Manchuria.\r\n\r\nJapanese control in Corea was completed, indeed, only after a series\r\nof wordy conflicts with the Corean Emperor and his Ministry, and after\r\na number of riots throughout Corea that had to be put down by Japanese\r\ntroops with much shedding of blood.\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of hostilities between Japan and Russia, an\r\nagreement between the Mikado’s representative and the Corean Emperor\r\nwas signed (February 23, 1904), whereby Corea adopted the advice of\r\nJapan in respect to various improvements in administration, while Japan\r\ninsured the safety of the Imperial Household of Corea and guaranteed\r\nthe independence and territorial integrity of the Corean Empire. By\r\nthis agreement, Japan secured the assistance of the Corean army in\r\nmovements in Corea.\r\n\r\nA second agreement between Japan and Corea, signed August 22, 1904,\r\nprovided for a Japanese Financial Adviser and a Foreign Diplomatic\r\nAdviser to regulate the Corean finances and foreign relations.\r\n\r\nOn November 18, 1905, two months after the signing of the Treaty of\r\nPortsmouth, occurred the formal transfer to Japan of the control of the\r\nCorean Government. This transfer was in accordance with a treaty signed\r\nthe day before, at Seoul, whereby it was provided that Japan should\r\ncontrol and direct the external relations and affairs of Corea, through\r\nthe Japanese Department of Foreign Affairs in Tokio. It was also agreed\r\nthat Japan should have direct representation at the Court of the\r\nEmperor of Corea by a Resident-General residing at Seoul. Count Ito, of\r\nTokio, was appointed to this post; and, acting under the terms of the\r\ntreaty, he at once stationed Japanese Residents (or local governors) at\r\nthe several open ports of Corea and at other places in Corea.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of Japanese control, the attitude of the Emperor of\r\nCorea toward the Mikado’s representatives was one of active opposition\r\nand at times even of open hostility. The secret plottings of the\r\ndisgruntled Emperor against the Japanese authorities reached their\r\nculminating act in the spring of 1907, when he sent a delegation,\r\nwith more or less secrecy, to the Hague Peace Conference. This led to\r\nhis abdication in favor of the Crown Prince, July 19, 1907. Coreans\r\nasserted that the abdication was compulsory. The facts, as given\r\nofficially, however, show that the Emperor abdicated by unanimous\r\nadvice of his Ministers.\r\n\r\nWith the accession to the throne of the new Emperor, a new Convention\r\nwas promulgated (July 25), in which the future course of Japanese\r\ncontrol was defined and agreed to by his Corean Majesty, as follows:\r\nFirst, the administration of the Corean Government was to be under the\r\nJapanese Resident-General, Count Ito; second, all transactions of\r\nimportant state affairs, as well as the enactment of all laws, were to\r\nreceive the approval of the Resident-General before going into effect;\r\nthird, all appointments of high executive officials were to receive\r\nthe approval of the Resident-General; fourth, Japanese subjects, if\r\nrecommended by the Resident-General, were to be eligible to hold\r\noffice under the Corean Government; fifth, no foreigners were to be\r\nemployed by the Corean Government excepting with the consent of the\r\nResident-General.\r\n\r\nAfter the signing of this Convention, the Corean army was disbanded. By\r\nMay 2, 1908, cordial relations between the new Emperor and the Japanese\r\nResident-General had progressed to such an extent that the Corean\r\nGovernment itself began an active campaign against the disorderly\r\nelements throughout the Empire.\r\n\r\nRelations between the Governments of Japan and the United States\r\ncontinued undisturbed through the first three years following the\r\nclose of the Russo-Japanese War, though at one time, in 1907, the\r\npress and people both in Japan and the United States went so far as to\r\ndiscuss the possibility of war between the two countries. The rumors\r\nof war were the outgrowth, first, of the act of the authorities of San\r\nFrancisco, California, in barring Japanese pupils from the regular\r\npublic schools; second, of the agitation in the United States to\r\nrestrict Japanese immigration; third, of the decision of the United\r\nStates Government to send a great fleet of battleships, for the first\r\ntime in history, to the Pacific; fourth, of attacks on Japanese\r\nsubjects at San Francisco and other places on the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nWhile barring Japanese pupils from the regular schools, the authorities\r\nof San Francisco proposed that a separate Oriental School be maintained\r\nfor Japanese, on the ground that the Japanese “schoolboys” were, many\r\nof them, grown men and that they corrupted the morals of the white\r\npupils. President Roosevelt sent Secretary of the Navy Metcalf to make\r\na thorough investigation and, upon receiving his report, requested\r\nthat the San Francisco officials abandon the idea of a separate school\r\nfor Orientals and that Japanese pupils be readmitted to the regular\r\npublic schools. San Francisco agreed to this, on condition that the\r\nUnited States Government take immediate measures to restrict further\r\nimmigration of Japanese from Hawaii, the Philippines, Canada, Mexico,\r\nand Panama.\r\n\r\nMeantime, popular demonstrations against the Japanese had taken place\r\nat various cities on the Pacific Coast. In San Francisco, especially,\r\nstores and other places of business conducted by Japanese were wrecked\r\nand the owners and employees thereof attacked. Action taken by the\r\nauthorities to punish the offenders led to rioting and still further\r\nattacks on the Japanese. The result was a formal protest from the\r\nJapanese Government demanding protection for Japanese subjects in\r\nCalifornia. Thereupon the Federal Government at Washington announced\r\nthat it would “proceed to use every available means, civil and\r\nmilitary, to protect aliens.” Attacks on the Japanese occurred at\r\nintervals, nevertheless, until well into 1908, when peace was seemingly\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1907, while the anti-Japanese feeling on the Pacific Coast\r\nof the United States ran highest, the Japanese Government received\r\nproposals from the United States Government in regard to restricting\r\nimmigration. To these restrictions the Japanese Government agreed\r\n(December 31), and in February, 1908, the matter was closed by an\r\nagreement signed by Japan to supervise future immigration to the United\r\nStates in accordance with the restrictions agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Japanese people in regard to the visit of the\r\nUnited States fleet to the Pacific Coast was at first one of mild alarm\r\nand resentment. Altogether different was the attitude of official\r\nJapan. So far was the Japanese Government from resenting the movement\r\nof the fleet that a formal invitation was sent to President Roosevelt\r\ninviting the United States ships of war to visit Japan. This invitation\r\nwas accepted March 20, 1908. In June the fleet, then on the Pacific\r\nCoast of the United States, was making preparations for the long\r\nvoyage to Japanese waters and thence around the world. And in proof\r\nof the cordial reception accorded to Americans and American wares in\r\nJapan, the Government at Tokio (April 1, 1908), published a report\r\ncontaining figures showing that the United States led the nations of\r\nthe world in trade with Japan. Moreover, a general Arbitration Treaty\r\nbetween Japan and the United States was signed at Washington, May 5,\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nPrince Fushimi, adopted brother of the Mikado, arrived in the United\r\nStates in November, 1904, calling on President Roosevelt on the 15th.\r\nThe reception accorded the Prince in Washington and other American\r\ncities gave great satisfaction in Japan, as did also the manner in\r\nwhich he was received in Canada and England, which countries he visited\r\nafter leaving the United States.\r\n\r\nJapanese-Chinese relations continued on a basis of uninterrupted\r\ncordiality following the close of the Russo-Japanese War, until early\r\nin 1908, when, in the Chinese harbor of Macao, Chinese officials seized\r\na Japanese merchant steamer, the _Tatsu Maru_, a large part of the\r\ncargo of which consisted of arms and munitions of war. The seizure\r\nimmediately created a sensation throughout both Empires. Japan, on\r\nFebruary 29th, demanded an apology and an indemnity from China for the\r\nseizure. On March 14th China returned the vessel to Japan and agreed\r\nto pay an indemnity, though she retained the arms found on board. The\r\nrelease of the ship caused widespread indignation among the Chinese,\r\nwho in vengeance started, in March, a boycott against the Japanese\r\nthat lasted until June, though Japan meanwhile formally requested the\r\nChinese authorities to suppress the boycott.\r\n\r\nJapan needed, of course, a confirmation from China of the transfer by\r\nRussia to Japan of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and of the lease of\r\nPort Arthur and the Liau-tung Peninsula, in accordance with the Treaty\r\nof Portsmouth. Accordingly, a Convention between the two countries was\r\nsigned January 22, 1906--thus completing the final move in securing to\r\nJapan her prizes won in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The koku, or “stone,” contains 5.13 bushels; is the measure by\r\nwhich revenue is estimated; is the standard value of the country;\r\nand is generally considered equivalent to one gold kobang. The only\r\ninvariable standard of value in the world is the average amount of food\r\nthat will suffice to keep a man in health--a pound varies, the other\r\ndoes not.\r\n\r\n[2] This was the title of the young man living in Paris in 1867.\r\nCommonly called brother of the Tycoon.\r\n\r\n[3] Ko, coming after a name, has the meaning of “a high personage,” a\r\ntitle of honor.\r\n\r\n[4] These four are the highest of the official or Fudai class of\r\nDaimio, and are commonly known as the Si Ten wo, or “four heavenly\r\nemperors”--a Buddhist title.\r\n\r\n[5] Saywa made the laws as to the Shinwo and royal families. His sixth\r\nson was Sadadzumi Sinwo. On Momidji yama (a little hill within the\r\ngrounds of the Yedo castle) is a small temple. On the altar are tablets\r\nwith the names of men of six generations: 1, Sadadzumi; 2, of his son\r\nTsune moto (who first took the name of Minna moto); 3, of his son Mitz\r\nnaka (a soldier of note); 4, of his son Yori nobu; 5, of his son Yori\r\nYoshi; 6, of his son Yoshiyay (otherwise called Hatchimang taro), and\r\nof his son Yoshi Kooni (whose descendants divided into the Nitta and\r\nAshikanga lines). The temple was erected for the reception of those\r\ntablets, to which worship is offered every morning.\r\n\r\n[6] There are two keng, one used at Miako, known as Miako no keng, or\r\nKioma, or Homma, the longer of the two. The other is the Inaka keng,\r\nor Inakama, shorter by three or four inches. Taikosama introduced the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n[7] A gambling game analogous to the “white-pigeon card” of China\r\n(Pak kop piu), at which much money is lost by families. A head office\r\nissues papers upon which the eighty first characters of the “Thousand\r\nCharacters Classic” are printed in rows. These may be purchased for\r\nany price the purchaser chooses to lay upon them. During the night\r\nten characters are marked by the office. The purchaser marks ten, and\r\nspeculates upon his hitting some or all of the same as were marked at\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\n[8] The dynasty having been recently set aside, the country is in a\r\ntransition state, and the position of these Daimios in the future\r\nremains to be worked out.\r\n\r\n[9] Whose retainers and secretary the Regent had arrested and brought\r\nto Yedo.\r\n\r\n[10] The mode of suicide common in Japan may be noticed here. It is\r\ncalled by the natives literally to “cut the belly.” The name “happy\r\ndispatch” seems to have been a felicitous suggestion of some foreigner.\r\nIt is said to be done by a cut across the abdomen, and sometimes\r\nanother cut is said to be made in the form of a cross. But any one who\r\nknows anything of the subject will think this nearly an impossibility,\r\nfrom the extreme difficulty of making the two other cuts necessary\r\nto make a cross. This would be a very butchering and trying job, and\r\nwould bring on only a lingering death. So far as can be judged from\r\nthe way it is performed in theaters, the knife, a short well-sharpened\r\ninstrument, is inserted into the abdomen, and then drawn across the\r\nbackbone, so as to sever the great blood-vessels, the aorta and\r\nascending vein, which are there of such a size as to allow of death\r\nfrom their division in a few seconds. There seems to be no drawing\r\nacross the abdomen. What is called swallowing gold leaf in China is in\r\nreality inhaling it when rubbed to a sort of flaky powder. It seems to\r\nchoke the air-vessels, and so produce suffocation.\r\n\r\n[11] Afterward assassinated by his servant, an emissary of Mito, who\r\nhad got into the office as clerk, and kept Mito informed of all that\r\ntranspired.\r\n\r\n[12] It is a custom in Japan that the territory of a man who has been\r\nkilled by assassins is taken from his family, and the family and\r\nretainers of the Regent were afraid of this law being put in operation\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[13] These are men at the palace gate who look out for Daimios\r\napproaching, and give notice to the guard, that they may know how to\r\nsalute them, according to their rank. They make money by bribes to give\r\nthe Daimios higher salutes than they are entitled to.\r\n\r\n[14] The sleeve peerage, as it is called, a little abridgment of the\r\nBookang, with the crests, names, and offices of Daimios, often used by\r\nstrangers to recognize Daimios passing.\r\n\r\n[15] Mito is said to have traveled over the empire incog. at this time,\r\nto study the feelings of the people.\r\n\r\n[16] The Gorochiu would not allow this to be granted, and never\r\npublished it.\r\n\r\n[17] The custom in Japan is to bring the left of the dress over the\r\nright side in front, “migi yeri”; and it is a common saying that\r\nforeigners will soon oblige them to change even this custom, and\r\n“hidari yeri,” cross it over the left side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation of English words have been\r\n    standardized.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation of words other than English have been\r\n    retained.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.\r\n\r\n  New original cover art included with this eBook is granted to the\r\n    public domain.",
