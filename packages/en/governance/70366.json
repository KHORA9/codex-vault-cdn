C., January 4, 1909_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to submit herewith for publication, with your\r\napproval, as Bulletin 41 of this Bureau, the report of Dr. Jesse\r\nWalter Fewkes on the work of excavation and repair of Spruce-tree\r\ncliff-ruin in the Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado. This was\r\nundertaken, pursuant to your instructions, under the direction of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, and a résumé of the general results\r\naccomplished is published in the latter’s annual report for 1907-8.\r\nThe present paper is more detailed, and deals with the technical\r\narcheological results.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to state that Doctor Fewkes was able to complete\r\nthe work assigned him, and that Spruce-tree House—the largest ruin\r\nin Mesa Verde Park with the exception of the Cliff Palace—is now\r\naccessible for the first time, in all its features, to those who\r\nwould view one of the great aboriginal monuments of our country.\r\nThis is the more important since Spruce-tree House fulfills the\r\nrequirements of a “type ruin,” and since, owing to its situation, it\r\nis the cliff-dwelling from which most tourists obtain their first\r\nimpressions of structures of this character.\r\n\r\n                   Respectfully, yours,         W. H. HOLMES, _Chief_.\r\n\r\n                     THE SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,\r\n                                                   _Washington, D.

The canyon ends\r\nblindly at the northern extremity, where there is a spring of good\r\nwater; it is wooded with tall piñons, cedars, and stately spruces,\r\nthe tops of which in some cases reach from its bed to its rim. The\r\ntrees predominating on the rim of the canyon are cedars and pines.\r\n\r\nThe rock out of which the canyon is eroded is sandstone of varying\r\ndegrees of hardness alternating with layers of coal and shale. The\r\nwater percolating through this sandstone, on meeting the harder\r\nshale, seeps out of the cliffs to the surface. As the water permeates\r\nthe rock it gradually undermines the harder layers of sandstone,\r\nwhich fall in great blocks, often leaving arches of rock above deep\r\ncaves. One of these caves is situated at the end of the canyon where\r\nthe rim rock overhangs the spring, which is filled by water seeping\r\ndown from above the shale. Another of these caves is that in which\r\nSpruce-tree House is situated. Several smaller caves, and ledges of\r\nrock harder than that immediately above, serve as sites for small\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThe wearing away of the fallen fragments of the cliffs is much\r\nhastened by the waterfalls which in time of heavy rains fall over\r\nthe rim rock, their force being greatly augmented by the height from\r\nwhich the water is precipitated. The fragments continually falling\r\nfrom the roofs of the caves form a talus that extends from the floors\r\nof the caves down the side of the cliff. The cliff-dwellings are\r\nerected on the top of this talus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there was once an old Spanish trail winding over the\r\nmountains by way of Mancos and Dolores from what is now New Mexico to\r\nUtah, the early visitors to this part of Colorado seem not to have\r\nbeen impressed with the prehistoric cliff-houses in the Montezuma\r\nvalley and on the Mesa Verde; at least they left no accounts of them\r\nin their writings. It appears that these early Spanish travelers\r\nencountered the Ute, possibly the Navaho Indians, along this trail,\r\nbut the more peaceable people who built and occupied the villages\r\nnow ruins in the neighborhood of Mancos and Cortez had apparently\r\ndisappeared even at that early date. Indian legends regarding the\r\ninhabitants of the cliff-dwellings of the Mesa Verde are very limited\r\nand indistinct. The Ute designate them as the houses of the dead,\r\nor _moki_, the name commonly applied to the Hopi of Arizona. One\r\nof the Ute legends mentions the last battle between the ancient\r\nhouse-builders of Montezuma valley and their ancestors, near Battle\r\nRock, in which it is said that the former were defeated and turned\r\ninto fishes.\r\n\r\nThe ruins in Mancos canyon were discovered and first explored in 1874\r\nby a Government party under Mr. W. H. Jackson.[2] The walls of ruins\r\nsituated in the valley have been so long exposed to the weather that\r\nthey are very much broken down, being practically nothing more than\r\nmounds. The few cliff-dwellings in Mancos canyon which were examined\r\nby Jackson are for the most part small; these are found on the west\r\nside. One of the largest is now known as Jackson ruin.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1875 Prof. W. H. Holmes, now Chief of the Bureau of\r\nAmerican Ethnology, made a trip through Mancos canyon and examined\r\nseveral ruins. He described and figured several cliff-houses\r\noverlooked by Jackson and drew attention to the remarkable stone\r\ntowers which are so characteristic of this region.[3] Professor\r\nHolmes secured a small collection of earthenware vessels, generally\r\nfragmentary, and also a few objects of shells, bone, and wood,\r\nfigures and descriptions of which accompany his report. Neither\r\nJackson nor Holmes, however, saw the most magnificent ruins of the\r\nMesa Verde. Had they followed up the side canyon of the Mancos\r\nthey would have discovered, as stated by Nordenskiöld, “ruins so\r\nmagnificent that they surpass anything of the kind known in the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\nThe following story of the discovery of the largest two of these\r\nruins, one of which is the subject of this article, is quoted from\r\nNordenskiöld:[4]\r\n\r\n  The honour of the discovery of these remarkable ruins belongs to\r\n  Richard and Alfred Wetherill of Mancos. The family own large herds\r\n  of cattle, which wander about on the Mesa Verde. The care of these\r\n  herds often calls for long rides on the mesa and in its labyrinth\r\n  of cañons. During these long excursions ruins, the one more\r\n  magnificent than the other, have been discovered. The two largest\r\n  were found by Richard Wetherill and Charley Mason one December day\r\n  in 1888, as they were riding together through the piñon wood on the\r\n  mesa, in search of a stray herd. They had penetrated through the\r\n  dense scrub to the edge of a deep cañon. In the opposite cliff,\r\n  sheltered by a huge, massive vault of rock, there lay before their\r\n  astonished eyes a whole town with towers and walls, rising out of\r\n  a heap of ruins. This grand monument of bygone ages seemed to them\r\n  well deserving of the name of the Cliff Palace. Not far from this\r\n  place, but in a different cañon, they discovered on the same day\r\n  another very large cliff-dwelling; to this they gave the name of\r\n  Sprucetree House, from a great spruce that jutted forth from the\r\n  ruins. During the course of years Richard and Alfred Wetherill have\r\n  explored the mesa and its cañons in all directions; they have thus\r\n  gained a more thorough knowledge of its ruins than anyone. Together\r\n  with their brothers John, Clayton, and Wynn, they have also carried\r\n  out excavations, during which a number of extremely interesting\r\n  finds have been made. A considerable collection of these objects,\r\n  comprising skulls, pottery, implements of stone, bone, and wood,\r\n  etc., has been sold to “The Historical Society of Colorado.” A\r\n  still larger collection is in the possession of the Wetherill\r\n  family. A brief catalogue of this collection forms the first\r\n  printed notice of the remarkable finds made during the excavations.\r\n\r\nMr. F. H. Chapin visited the Mesa Verde ruins in 1889 and published\r\nillustrated accounts[5] of his visit containing much information\r\nlargely derived from the Wetherills and others. Dr. W. R. Birdsall\r\nalso published an account of these ruins,[6] illustrated by several\r\nfigures. Neither Chapin nor Birdsall gives special attention to the\r\nruin now called Spruce-tree House, and while their writings are\r\ninteresting and valuable in the general history of the archeology\r\nof the Mesa Verde, they are of little aid in our studies of this\r\nparticular ruin. The same may be said of the short and incomplete\r\nnotices of the Mesa Verde ruins which have appeared in several\r\nnewspapers. The scientific descriptions of Spruce-tree House as well\r\nas of other Mesa Verde ruins begin with the memoir of the talented\r\nSwede, Baron Gustav Nordenskiöld, who, in his work, “The Cliff\r\nDwellers of the Mesa Verde”, gives the first comprehensive account\r\nof the ruins of this mesa. It is not too much to say that he has\r\nrendered to American archeology in this work a service which will be\r\nmore and more appreciated in the future development of that science.\r\nIn order to make more comprehensive the present author’s report on\r\nSpruce-tree House, the following description of this ruin is quoted\r\nfrom Nordenskiöld’s memoir (pp. 50-56):\r\n\r\n  A few hundred paces to the north along the cliff lead to a large\r\n  cave, in the shadow of which lie the ruins of a whole village,\r\n  _Sprucetree House_. This cave is 70 m. broad and 28 m. in depth.\r\n  The height is small in comparison with the depth, the interior\r\n  of the cave thus being rather dark. The ground is fairly even and\r\n  lies almost on a level, which has considerably facilitated the\r\n  building operations. A plan of the ruins is given in Pl. IX. A\r\n  great part of the house, or rather village, is in an excellent\r\n  state of preservation, both the walls, which at some places are\r\n  several stories high and rise to the roof of rock, and the floors\r\n  between the different stories still remaining. The architecture\r\n  is the same as that described in the ruins on Wetherill’s Mesa.\r\n  In some parts more care is perhaps displayed in the shape of\r\n  the blocks and in the joints between them. The walls, here as\r\n  in other cliff-dwellings, are about 0.3 m. thick, seldom more.\r\n  A point which immediately strikes the eye in Pl. IX, is that no\r\n  premeditated design has been followed in the erection of the\r\n  buildings. It seems as if only a few rooms had first been built,\r\n  additions having subsequently been made to meet the requirements\r\n  of the increasing population. This circumstance, which I have\r\n  already touched upon when describing other ruins, may be observed\r\n  in most of the cliff-dwellings. There is further evidence to\r\n  show that the whole village was not erected at the same time. At\r\n  several places it may be seen that new walls have been added to\r\n  the old, though the stones of both walls do not fit into each\r\n  other, as is the case when two adjacent walls have been constructed\r\n  simultaneously. The arrangement of the rooms has been determined\r\n  by the surrounding cliff, the walls being generally built either\r\n  at right angles or parallel to it. At some places the walls\r\n  of several adjoining apartments of about equal size have been\r\n  consistently erected in the same direction, some blocks of rooms\r\n  thus possessing a regularity which is wanting in the cliff-village\r\n  as a whole. This is perhaps the first stage in the development of\r\n  the cliff-dwellings to the villages whose ruins are common in the\r\n  valleys and on the mesa, and which are constructed according to a\r\n  fixed design.\r\n\r\n  In the plan (Pl. IX) it may be seen that the cave contains two\r\n  distinct groups of rooms. At about the middle of the cliff-village\r\n  a kind of passage (23), uninterrupted by any wall, runs through\r\n  the whole ruin. We found the remains, however, of a cross wall\r\n  projecting from an elliptical room (14 in the plan) in the south\r\n  part of the village. Each of these two divisions of the ruin\r\n  contains an open space (16 and 28) at the back of the cave, the\r\n  ground in both these places being covered with bird droppings. It\r\n  is probable that this was the place where tame turkeys were kept,\r\n  though it can not have been a very pleasant abode for them, for\r\n  at least in the north of the ruin this part of the cave is almost\r\n  pitch dark, the walls of the inner court (28), rising up to the\r\n  roof of rock. In each of the two divisions of the cliff-village a\r\n  number of estufas were built, in the north at least five, in the\r\n  south at least two; while several more are, no doubt, buried in\r\n  the heaps of ruins. These estufas preserve to the least detail\r\n  the ordinary type (diam. 4-5 metres) fully described above. They\r\n  are generally situated in front of the other rooms, with their\r\n  foundations sunk deeper in the ground, and have never had an\r\n  upper story. Even their site suggests that they were used for\r\n  some special purpose, probably as assembly-rooms at religious\r\n  festivities held by those members of the tribe who lived in the\r\n  adjacent rooms. In all the estufas without exception the roof has\r\n  fallen in. It is probable, as I have mentioned before, that the\r\n  entrance of these rooms, as is still the case among the Pueblo\r\n  Indians, was constructed in the roof. The other rooms were entered\r\n  by narrow doorways (breadth 40-55 cm., height 65-80 cm.). These\r\n  doorways are generally rectangular, often somewhat narrower at the\r\n  top; the sill consists, as already described, of a long stone slab,\r\n  the lintel of a few sticks a couple of centimetres in thickness,\r\n  laid across the opening to support the wall above them. The arch\r\n  was unknown to the builders of these villages, even in the form\r\n  common among the ruins of Central America, and constructed by\r\n  carrying the walls on both sides of the doorway nearer to each\r\n  other as each course of stones was laid, until they could be\r\n  joined by a stone slab placed across them. Along both sides of the\r\n  doorway and under the lintel a narrow frame of thin sticks covered\r\n  with plaster was built (see fig. 28 to the left). This frame,\r\n  which leant inwards, served to support the door, a thin, flat,\r\n  rectangular stone slab of suitable size. Through two loops on the\r\n  outside of the wall, made of osiers inserted in the chinks between\r\n  the stones, and placed one on each side of the doorway, a thin\r\n  stick was passed, thus forming a kind of bolt. Besides this type of\r\n  door most cliff-villages contain examples of another. Some doorways\r\n  present the appearance shown in fig. 28 to the right (height 90\r\n  cm., breadth at the top, 45 cm., at the bottom 30 cm.) They were\r\n  not closed with a stone slab. They probably belonged to the rooms\r\n  most frequented in daily life, and were therefore fashioned so as\r\n  to admit of more convenient ingress and egress. The other doorways,\r\n  through which it is by no means easy to enter, probably belonged in\r\n  general to storerooms or other chambers not so often visited and\r\n  requiring for some reason or other a door to close them. It should\r\n  be mentioned that the large, =T=-shaped doors described above are\r\n  rare in the ruins on Wetherill’s Mesa which both in architecture\r\n  and in other respects bear traces of less care and skill on the\r\n  part of the builders, and are also in a more advanced stage of\r\n  decay, thus giving the impression of greater age than the ruins\r\n  treated of in the present chapter, though without showing any\r\n  essential differences.\r\n\r\n  The rooms, with the exception of the estufas, are nearly always\r\n  rectangular, the sides measuring seldom more than two or three\r\n  metres. North of the passage (23) which divides the ruin into two\r\n  parts, a whole series of rooms (26, 29-33) still extends outwards\r\n  from the back of the cave, their walls reaching up to the roof of\r\n  rock, and the floors between the upper and lower stories being in\r\n  a perfect state of preservation. The lower rooms are generally\r\n  entered by small doors opening directly on the “street.” In the\r\n  interior the darkness is almost complete, especially in room 34,\r\n  which has no direct communication with the passage. It must be\r\n  approached either through 35, which is a narrow room with the short\r\n  side towards the “street” entirely open, or through 33. We used 34\r\n  as a dark room for photographic purposes.\r\n\r\n  The walls and roof of some rooms are thick with soot. The\r\n  inhabitants must have had no great pretensions as regards light\r\n  and air. The doorways served also as windows, though at one or two\r\n  places small, quadrangular loop-holes have been constructed in\r\n  the walls for the passage of light. Entrance to the upper story\r\n  is generally gained by a small quadrangular hole in the roof at a\r\n  corner of the lower room, a foothold being afforded merely by some\r\n  stones projecting from the walls. This hole was probably covered\r\n  with a stone slab like the doors. Thick beams of cedar or piñon\r\n  and across them thin poles, laid close together, form the floors\r\n  between the stories. In some cases long sticks were laid in pairs\r\n  across the cedar beams at a distance of some decimeters between the\r\n  pairs, a layer of twigs and cedar bast was placed over the sticks,\r\n  and the whole was covered with clay, which was smoothed and dried.\r\n\r\n  In several other parts of the ruin besides this the walls still\r\n  reach the roof of the cave. These walls are marked in the plan.\r\n  In all the estufas and in some of the other rooms, perhaps the\r\n  apartments of chiefs or families of rank, the walls are covered\r\n  with a thin coat of yellow plaster. In one instance they are\r\n  even decorated with a painting, representing two birds, which is\r\n  reproduced in one of the following chapters. Pl. X: 2 shows a part\r\n  of the ruin, situated in the north of the cave. The spot from which\r\n  the photograph was taken, as well as the approximate angle of view,\r\n  is marked in the plan. The left half of the photograph is occupied\r\n  by a wall with doorways, rising to a height of three stories and\r\n  up to the roof of the cave; within the wall lies a series of five\r\n  rooms on the ground floor; behind these rooms the large open space\r\n  mentioned above (28) occupies the depths of the cavern. Here the\r\n  beams are all that remains of the floors of the upper stories,\r\n  their ends projecting a foot or two beyond the wall between the\r\n  second and third stories, where support was probably afforded in\r\n  this manner to a balcony, as an easier means of communication\r\n  between the rooms of the upper stories. In front of this part of\r\n  the building, but not visible in the photograph, lie two estufas\r\n  and outside the latter is a long wall. To judge by the ruins, the\r\n  roofs of these estufas once lay on a level with the floors of the\r\n  adjoining rooms, so that over the estufas, which were sunk in the\r\n  ground, only the roofs being left visible, the inhabitants had an\r\n  open space, bounded on the outside by the said long wall, which\r\n  formed a rampart at the edge of the talus. The same method of\r\n  construction is employed by the Moki Indians in their estufas; but\r\n  these rooms are rectangular in form.—Farther north lies another\r\n  estufa. Its site, nearest to the cliff wall, would seem to indicate\r\n  that it is the oldest. The walls in the north of the ruin still\r\n  rise to a height of 6 metres.\r\n\r\n  The south part of the ruin is similar in all respects to the north.\r\n  Its only singularity is a room of elliptical shape (axes 3.6 and\r\n  2.9 m.); from this room a wall runs south, enclosing a small open\r\n  space (16) where, as at the corresponding place in the north of the\r\n  ruin, the ground is covered with bird droppings mixed with dust and\r\n  refuse. At one end there are two semicircular enclosures (17, 18)\r\n  of loose stones forming low walls. In a pentagonal room (8) south\r\n  of this open space one corner contains a kind of closet (height 1.2\r\n  m., length and breadth O.9 m.) composed of two large upright slabs\r\n  of stone, with a third slab laid across them in a sloping position\r\n  and cemented fast (see fig. 29). Of the use to which this “closet”\r\n  was put, I am ignorant. Farther south some of the rooms are\r\n  situated on a narrow ledge, along which a wall has been erected,\r\n  probably for purposes of defense.\r\n\r\n  Plate X: 1 is a photograph of Sprucetree House from the opposite\r\n  side of the cañon. The illustrations give a better idea of the\r\n  ruin’s appearance than any description could do.\r\n\r\n  Our excavations in Sprucetree House lasted only a few days. This\r\n  ruin will certainly prove a rich field for future researches.[7]\r\n  Some handsome baskets and pieces of pottery were the best finds\r\n  made during the short period of our excavations. In a room (69)\r\n  belonging to the north part of the ruin we found the skeletons of\r\n  three children who had been buried there.\r\n\r\n  A circumstance which deserves mention, and which was undoubtedly\r\n  of great importance to the inhabitants of Sprucetree House, is the\r\n  presence at the bottom of the cañon, a few hundred paces from the\r\n  ruin, of a fairly good spring.\r\n\r\n  Near Sprucetree House there are a number of very small, isolated\r\n  rooms, situated on ledges most difficult of access. One of these\r\n  tiny cliff-dwellings may be seen to the left in fig. 27. It is\r\n  improbable that these cells, which are sometimes so small that one\r\n  can hardly turn in them, were really dwelling places; their object\r\n  is unknown to me, unless it was one of defense, archers being\r\n  posted there when danger threatened, so that the enemy might have\r\n  to face a volley of arrows from several points at once. In such a\r\n  position a few men could defend themselves, even against an enemy\r\n  of superior force, for an assailant could reach the ledge only by\r\n  climbing with hands and feet. Another explanation, perhaps better,\r\n  was suggested to me by Mr. Fewkes. He thinks that these small\r\n  rooms were shrines where offerings to the gods were deposited. No\r\n  object has, however, been found to confirm this suggestion.\r\n\r\n  To the right of fig. 27 a huge spruce may be seen. Its roots lie\r\n  within the ruins of Sprucetree House, the trunk projecting from the\r\n  wall of an estufa. In Pl. X: 1 the tree is wanting. I had it cut\r\n  down in order to ascertain its age. We counted the rings, which\r\n  were very distinct, twice over, the results being respectively 167\r\n  and 169. I had supposed from the thickness of the tree that the\r\n  number of the rings was much greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the majority of cliff-dwellings in the Mesa Verde National\r\nPark, Spruce-tree House stands in a recess protected above by an\r\noverhanging cliff. Its form is crescentic, following that of the cave\r\nand extending approximately north and south.\r\n\r\nThe author has given the number of rooms and their dimensions in his\r\nreport to the Secretary of the Interior (published in the latter’s\r\nreport for 1907-8) from which he makes the following quotation:\r\n\r\n  The total length of Spruce-tree House was found to be 216 feet,\r\n  its width at the widest part 89 feet. There were counted in the\r\n  Spruce-tree House 114 rooms, the majority of which were secular,\r\n  and 8 ceremonial chambers or kivas. Nordenskiöld numbered 80 of\r\n  the former and 7 of the latter, but in this count he apparently\r\n  did not differentiate in the former those of the first, second and\r\n  third stories. Spruce-tree House was in places 3 stories high;\r\n  the third-story rooms had no artificial roof, but the wall of the\r\n  cave served that purpose. Several rooms, the walls of which are\r\n  now two stories high, formerly had a third story above the second,\r\n  but their walls have now fallen, leaving as the only indication of\r\n  their former union with the cave lines destitute of smoke on the\r\n  top of the cavern. Of the 114 rooms, at least 14 were uninhabited,\r\n  being used as storage and mortuary chambers. If we eliminate these\r\n  from the total number of rooms we have 100 enclosures which might\r\n  have been dwellings. Allowing 4 inhabitants for each of these 100\r\n  rooms would give about 400 persons as an aboriginal population of\r\n  Spruce-tree House. But it is probable that this estimate should\r\n  be reduced, as not all the 100 rooms were inhabited at the same\r\n  time, there being evidence that several of them had occupants long\r\n  after others were deserted. Approximately, Spruce-tree House had a\r\n  population not far from 350 people, or about 100 more than that of\r\n  Walpi, one of the best-known Hopi pueblos.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the houses are two large recesses used for\r\nrefuse-heaps or for burial of the dead. From the abundance of guano\r\nand turkey bones it is supposed that turkeys were kept in these\r\nplaces for ceremonial or other purposes. Here have been found several\r\ndesiccated human bodies commonly called mummies.\r\n\r\nThe ruin is divided by a street into two sections, the northern and\r\nthe southern, the former being the more extensive. Light is prevented\r\nfrom entering the larger of these recesses by rooms which reach the\r\nroof of the cave. In front of these rooms are circular subterranean\r\nrooms called _kivas_, which are sunken below the surrounding level\r\nplaces, or plazas, the roofs of these kivas having been formerly\r\nlevel with the plazas.\r\n\r\nThe front boundary of these plazas is a wall[9] which when the\r\nexcavations were begun was buried under débris of fallen walls, but\r\nwhich formerly stood several feet above the level of the plazas.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR ANTIQUITIES\r\n\r\nUnder this term are included those immovable prehistoric remains\r\nwhich, taken together, constitute a cliff-dwelling. The architectural\r\nfeatures—walls of rooms and structures connected with them, as beams,\r\nbalconies, fireplaces—are embraced in the term “major antiquities.”\r\nNone of these can be removed from their sites without harm, so they\r\nmust be protected in the place where they now stand.\r\n\r\nIn a valuable article on the ruins in valley of the San Juan and\r\nits tributaries, Dr. T. Mitchell Prudden[10] recognizes in this\r\nregion what he designates a “unit type;” that is, a ruin consisting\r\nof a kiva backed by a row of rooms generally situated on its north\r\nside, with lateral extensions east and west, and a burial place\r\non the opposite, or south, side of the kiva. This form of “unit\r\ntype,” as he points out, is more apparent in ruins situated in an\r\nopen country than in those built in cliffs. The same form may be\r\nrecognized in Spruce-tree House, which is composed of several “unit\r\ntypes” arranged side by side. The simplicity of these “unit types”\r\nis somewhat modified, however, in this as in all cliff-dwellings, by\r\nthe form of the site. The author would amend Prudden’s definition of\r\nthe “unit type” as applied to cliff-houses by adding to the latter’s\r\ndescription a bounding wall connecting the two lateral extensions of\r\nthe row of rooms, thus forming the south side of the enclosure of the\r\nkiva. For obvious reasons, in this amended description the burial\r\nplace is absent, as it does not occur in the position assigned to it\r\nin the original description.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAZAS AND COURTS\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the buildings of Spruce-tree House are divided into\r\na northern and a southern section by a street which penetrates from\r\nplaza G to the rear of the cave. (Pl. 1.) The northern section is not\r\nonly the larger, but there is evidence that it is also the older. It\r\nis bounded by some of the best-constructed buildings, situated along\r\nthe north side of the street. The rooms of the southern section are\r\nless numerous, although in some respects more instructive.\r\n\r\nThere are practically the same number of plazas as of kivas in this\r\nruin. With the exception of C and D, each plaza is occupied by a\r\nsingle kiva, the roof of which constitutes the central part of the\r\nfloor of the square enclosure (plaza). The plazas commonly contain\r\nremnants of small shrines, fireplaces, and corn-grinding bins, and\r\nare perforated by mysterious holes evidently used in ceremonies.\r\nTheir floors are hardened by the tramping of the many feet that\r\npassed over them. The best preserved of all the plazas is that which\r\ncontains kiva G. It can hardly be supposed that the roof of kiva A\r\nserved as a dance place, which is the ordinary office of a plaza, but\r\nit may have been used in ceremonies. The largest plaza of the series,\r\nin the rear of which are rooms while the front is inclosed by the\r\nbounding wall, is that containing kivas C and D. The appearance of\r\nthis plaza before and after clearing out and repairing is shown in\r\nplate 3; the view was taken from the north end of the ruin.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of fireplaces and similar evidences it may be\r\nconcluded that the street already mentioned as dividing the village\r\ninto two sections served many purposes. Most important of these was\r\nits use as the open-air dwellings of the villagers. Its hardened\r\nclay floor suggests the constant passage of many feet. Its surface\r\nslopes gradually downward from the back of the cave, ending at a step\r\nnear the round room in the rear of kiva G. This step marks also the\r\neastern boundary of the plaza (G) which contains the best preserved\r\nof all the ceremonial rooms of Spruce-tree House.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by excavation of the wall that originally formed the\r\nfront of the village was important. In this way was revealed a\r\ncorrect ground plan of the ruin (pl. 1) which had never before been\r\ntraced by archeologists. When the work began, this wall was deeply\r\nburied under accumulated débris, its course not being visible to\r\nany considerable extent. By removing the fallen stones composing\r\nthe débris the wall could be readily traced. In the repair work\r\nthe original stones were replaced in the structure. As in the\r\nfirst instance this wall was probably about as high as the head,\r\nit may have been used for protection. The only openings are small\r\nrectangular orifices, the presence of one opposite the external\r\nopening of the air flue of each kiva suggesting that formerly these\r\nflues opened outside the wall. Two kivas, B and F, are situated west\r\nof this wall and therefore outside the village. There are evidences\r\nof a walk on top of the talus along the front of the pueblo outside\r\nthe front wall, and of a retaining wall to prevent the edge of the\r\ntalus from wearing away. (Pls. 4, 5.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF WALLS\r\n\r\nThe walls of Spruce-tree House were built of stones generally laid in\r\nmortar but sometimes piled on one another, the joints being pointed\r\nlater. Sections of walls in which no mortar was used occur on the\r\ntops of other walls. These dry walls served among other purposes to\r\nshield the roofs of adjacent buildings from snow and rain. Whenever\r\nmortar was used it appears that a larger quantity was employed than\r\nwas necessary, the effect being to weaken the wall since the pointing\r\nwashed out quickly, being less capable than stone of resisting\r\nerosion. When the mortar wore away, the wall was left in danger of\r\nfalling of its own weight. The pointing was generally done with the\r\nhands, the superficial impressions of which show in several places.\r\nSmall flakes of stone or fragments of pottery were sometimes inserted\r\nin the joints, serving both as a decoration, and as a protection by\r\npreventing the rapid wearing away of the mortar. Little pellets of\r\nclay were also used in the joints for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe character of masonry in different rooms varies considerably, in\r\nsome places showing good, in others poor, workmanship. As a rule\r\nthe construction of the corners is weak, the stones forming them\r\nbeing rarely bonded or tied. Component stones of the walls seldom\r\nbreak joints; thus a well-known device by means of which walls are\r\nstrengthened is lacking, and consequently cracks are numerous and\r\nthe work is unstable. Fully half the stones used in construction\r\nwere hammered or dressed into desirable shapes, the remainder being\r\nlaid as they were gathered, with their flat surfaces exposed when\r\npossible. (Pls. 6, 7.)\r\n\r\nSome of the walls were out of plumb when constructed and the faces\r\nof many were never straight. The walls show evidences of having been\r\nrepeatedly repaired, as indicated by a difference in color of the\r\nmortar used.\r\n\r\nPlasters of different colors, as red, white, yellow, and brown, were\r\nused. The lower half of the wall of a room was generally painted\r\nbrownish red, the upper half often white. There are evidences of\r\nseveral coats of plastering, especially on the walls of the kivas,\r\nsome of which are much discolored with smoke.\r\n\r\nThe replastering of the walls of Hopi kivas is an incident of the\r\n_Powamû_ festival, or ceremonial purification of the fields commonly\r\ncalled the “Bean planting,” which occurs every February. On a certain\r\nday of this festival girls thoroughly replaster the four walls of the\r\nkivas and at the close of the work leave impressions of their hands\r\nin white mud on the kiva beams.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of Spruce-tree House may be considered under two headings:\r\nsecular rooms, and ceremonial rooms, or kivas. The former are\r\nrectangular, the latter circular, in form.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECULAR ROOMS\r\n\r\nThe secular rooms are the more numerous in Spruce-tree House. In\r\norder to designate them in future descriptions they were numbered\r\nfrom 1 to 71, in black paint, in conspicuous places on the walls.\r\n(Pl. 1.) This enumeration begins at the north end and passes thence\r\nto the south end of the ruin, but in one or two instances this order\r\nis not followed. The author has given below a brief reference to some\r\nof the important secular rooms in the series.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of room 1 were apparently built on a fallen bowlder,\r\nthe entrance being reached by means of a series of stone steps built\r\ninto the side hill. The floor of this room is on the level of the\r\nsecond story of other rooms, being continuous with the top of kiva\r\nA. It is probable that when this kiva was constructed it was found\r\nimpossible to make it subterranean on account of the solid rock. A\r\nretaining wall was built outside the kiva and the intervening space\r\nwas filled with earth in order to impart to the room a subterranean\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nRoom 2 has three stories, or tiers, of rooms. The floor of the second\r\nstory, which is the roof of the first, is well preserved, the sides\r\nof the hatchway, or means of passage from one room to the one below\r\nit, being almost entire. This room possesses a feature which is\r\nunique. The base of its south wall is supported by curved timbers,\r\nwhose ends rest on walls, while the middle is supported by a pillar\r\nof masonry. (Pl. 8.) The =T=-shaped door in this wall faces south. It\r\nis difficult to understand how the aperture could have been of any\r\nuse as a doorway unless there was a balcony below it, and no sign of\r\nsuch structure is now visible. The west wall of rooms 2 and 3 was\r\nbuilt on top of a fallen rock from which it rises precipitously to a\r\nconsiderable height. The floor of room 4, which lies in front of kiva\r\nA, is on a level with the roof of the kiva, and somewhat higher than\r\nthe surface of the neighboring plaza but not higher than the roof\r\nof the first story. As the floors of room 1 and room 4 are on the\r\nsame level, it would appear that both were considerably elevated or\r\nso constructed otherwise that the kiva should be subterranean. This\r\nendeavor to render the kiva subterranean by building up around it,\r\nwhen conditions made it impossible to excavate in the solid rock, is\r\nparalleled in some other Mesa Verde ruins.\r\n\r\nThe ventilator of kiva A, as will be seen later, does not open\r\nthrough the front wall, as is usually the case, but on one side. This\r\nis accounted for by the presence of a room on this side of the kiva.\r\nRooms 2, 3, 4 were constructed after the walls of kiva A were built,\r\nhence several modifications were necessary in the prescribed plan of\r\nbuilding these rooms.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the inclosure, 5, conforms on one side to the\r\nouter wall of the village, and on the other to the curvature of kiva\r\nB. As this inclosure does not seem ever to have been roofed, it is\r\nprobable that it was not a house. A fireplace at one end indicates\r\nthat cooking was formerly done here. It is instructive to note that\r\nthe front wall of the ruin begins at this place.\r\n\r\nRooms 6, 7, 8, which lie side by side, closely resemble one another,\r\nhaving much in common. They were evidently dwellings, and may have\r\nbeen sleeping-places for families. Rooms 7 and 8 were two stories\r\nhigh, the floor of no. 8 being on a level with the adjoining plaza.\r\nRoom 9 is so unusual in its construction that it can not be regarded\r\nas a living room. It was used as a mortuary chamber, evidences being\r\nstrong that it was opened from time to time for new interments. Room\r\n12 also was a ceremonial chamber, and, like the preceding, will be\r\nconsidered later at greater length. The walls of the two rooms, 10\r\nand 11, are low, projecting into plaza C, of whose border they form\r\na part. Near them, or in one corner of the same plaza, is a bin, the\r\nsides of which are formed of stone slabs set on edge. The use of this\r\nbin is problematical.\r\n\r\nThe front wall of room 15 had been almost wholly destroyed before\r\nthe repair work began, and was so unstable that it was necessary to\r\nerect a buttress to support it. This room, which is one story high,\r\nis irregular in shape; its doorways open into rooms 14 and 16. The\r\nwalls of rooms 16 and 18 extend to the roof of the cave, shutting out\r\nthe light on one side from the great refuse-place in the rear of the\r\ncliff-dwellings. The openings through the walls of these rooms into\r\nthis darkened area have been much broken by vandals, and the walls\r\ngreatly damaged. Room 17, like 16 and 18, is somewhat larger than\r\nmost of the apartments in Spruce-tree House.\r\n\r\nTheoretically it may be supposed that when Spruce-tree House was\r\nfirst settled it had one clan occupying a cluster of rooms, 1-11,\r\nand one ceremonial room, kiva A. As the place grew three other “unit\r\ntypes” centering about kivas C-H were added, and still later each of\r\nthese units was enlarged and new kivas were built in each section.\r\nThus A was enlarged by addition of B; C by addition of D; E by\r\naddition of F; and G was subordinated to H. In this way the rooms\r\nnear the kivas grew in numbers. The block of rooms designated 50-53\r\nis not accounted for, however, in this theory.\r\n\r\nRooms numbered 19-22 are instructive. Their walls are well preserved\r\nand form the east side of plaza C. These walls extend from the level\r\nof the plaza to the top of the cavern, and in places show some of the\r\nbest masonry in Spruce-tree House. Just in front of room 19, situated\r\non the left-hand side as one enters the doorway, is a covered recess,\r\nwhere probably ceremonial bread was baked or otherwise cooked. This\r\nplace bears a strong resemblance to recesses found in Hopi villages,\r\nespecially as in its floor is set a cooking-pot made of earthenware.\r\nRooms 19-21 are two stories high; there are fireplaces in the corners\r\nand doorways on the front sides. The upper stories were approached\r\nand entered by balconies. The holes in which formerly rested the\r\nbeams that supported these balconies can be clearly seen.\r\n\r\nRooms 21 and 22 are three stories high, the entrances to the three\r\ntiers being seen in the accompanying view (pl. 6). The beams that\r\nonce supported the balcony of the third story resemble those of the\r\nfirst story; they project from the wall that forms the front of room\r\n29.\r\n\r\nThe external entrance to room 24 opens directly on the plaza. Some of\r\nthe rafters of this room still remain, and near the rear door is a\r\nprojecting wall, in the corner of which is a fireplace. Although room\r\n25 is three stories high, it does not reach to the cave top. None of\r\nthe roofs of the rooms one over another are intact, and the west side\r\nof the second and third stories is very much broken. The plaster of\r\nthe second-story walls is decorated with mural paintings that will\r\nbe considered more fully under Pictographs. It is not evident how\r\nentrance through the doorway of the second story was made unless we\r\nsuppose that there was a notched log, or ladder, for that purpose\r\nresting on the ground. In order to strengthen the north wall of room\r\n25 it was braced against the walls of outer rooms by constructing\r\nmasonry above the doorway that leads from plaza D to room 26. This\r\ntied all three walls together and imparted corresponding strength to\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nThe lower-story walls of room 26 are in fairly good condition, having\r\nneeded but little repair. There is a good fireplace in the floor at\r\nthe northeast corner. Excavations revealed a passageway from kiva D\r\ninto room 26, the opening into the upper room being situated near its\r\nnorth wall. The west wall of room 26 is curved. The walls of rooms\r\n27 and 28 are much dilapidated, the portion of the western section\r\nthat remains being continuous with the front wall of the pueblo. A\r\nsmall mural fragment ending blindly arises from the outside of the\r\nwest wall of room 27. This is believed to have been part of a small\r\nenclosure used for cooking purposes. Much repairing was necessary\r\nin the walls of rooms 27 and 28, since they were situated almost\r\ndirectly in the way of torrents of water which in time of rains fall\r\nover the rim of the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe block of rooms numbered 30-44, situated east of kiva E, have\r\nthe most substantial masonry and are the best constructed of any in\r\nSpruce-tree House. (Pl. 9.) As room 45 is only a dark passageway\r\nit should be considered more a street than a dwelling. Rooms 30-36\r\nare one story each in height, rectangular in shape, roofless, and\r\nof about the same dimensions; of these room 35 is perhaps the best\r\npreserved, having well-constructed fireplaces in one corner. Rooms\r\n37, 38, 39 are built deep in the cavern; their walls, especially\r\nthose of 38, are very much broken down. There would seem to be hardly\r\na possibility that these rooms were inhabited, especially after the\r\nconstruction of the rooms in front of the cave which shut off all\r\nlight. But they may easily have served as storage places. Their walls\r\nwere constructed of well-dressed stones and afford an example of\r\ngood masonry work.\r\n\r\nHere and there are indications of other rooms in the darker parts of\r\nthe cave. In some instances their walls extended to the roof of the\r\ncave where their former position is indicated by light bands on the\r\nsooty surface.\r\n\r\nRooms 40-47 are among the finest chambers in Spruce-tree House. Rooms\r\n48 and 49 are very much damaged, the walls having fallen, leaving\r\nonly the foundations above the ground level. Several rooms in this\r\npart of the ruin, especially rooms 43 (pl. 9) and 44, still have\r\nroofs and floors as well preserved as when they were built, and\r\nalthough dark, owing to lack of windows, they have fireplaces in\r\nthe corners, the smoke escaping apparently through the diminutive\r\ndoor openings. The thresholds of some of the doorways are too high\r\nabove the main court to be entered without ladders or notched poles,\r\nbut projecting stones or depressions for the feet, still visible,\r\napparently assisted the inhabitants, as they do modern visitors, to\r\nenter rooms 41 and 42.\r\n\r\nEach of the small block of rooms 50-53 is one story and without a\r\nroof, but possessing well-preserved ground floors. In room 53 there\r\nis a depression in the floor at the bottom of which is a small\r\nhole.[11]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages there have been considered the rooms of the\r\nnorth section of Spruce-tree House, embracing dwellings, ceremonial\r\nrooms, and other enclosures north of the main court, and the space\r\nin the rear called the refuse-heap—in all, six circular ceremonial\r\nrooms and a large majority of the living and storage rooms. From all\r\nthe available facts at the author’s disposal it is supposed that\r\nthis portion is older than the south section, which contains but two\r\nceremonial rooms and not more than a third the number of secular\r\ndwellings.[12]\r\n\r\nThe cluster of rooms connected with kivas G and H shows signs of\r\nhaving been built by a clan which may have joined Spruce-tree House\r\nsubsequent to the construction of the north section of the village.\r\nThe ceremonial rooms in this section differ in form from the others.\r\nHere occur two round rooms or towers, duplicates of which have not\r\nbeen found in the north section.\r\n\r\nRoom 61 in the south section of Spruce-tree House has a closet made\r\nof flat stones set on edge and covered with a perforated stone slab\r\nslightly inclined from the horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe inclosures at the extreme south end, which follow a narrow ledge,\r\nappear to have been unroofed passages rather than rooms. On ledges\r\nsomewhat higher there are small granaries each with a hole in the\r\nside, probably for the storage of corn.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the terraced form of buildings, almost\r\nuniversal in modern three-story pueblos and common in pictures of\r\nruins south of the San Juan, does not exist in Spruce-tree House. The\r\nfront of the three tiers of rooms 22, 23, as shown in plate 3, is\r\nvertical, not terraced from foundation to top. Whether the walls of\r\nrooms now in ruins were terraced or not can not be determined, for\r\nthese have been washed out and have fallen to so great an extent that\r\nit is almost impossible to tell their original form. Rooms 25-28,\r\nfor instance, might have been terraced on the front side, but it is\r\nmore reasonable to suppose they were not;[13] from the arrangement of\r\ndoors it would seem that there was a lateral entrance on the ground\r\nfloor rather than through roofs.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALCONIES\r\n\r\nBalconies attached to the walls of buildings below rows of doors\r\noccurred at several places. On no other hypothesis than the presence\r\nof these structures can be explained the elevated situation of\r\nentrances opening into the rooms immediately above rooms 20, 21,\r\n22. In fact, there appear to have been two balconies at this place,\r\none above the other, but all now left of them is the projecting\r\nfloor-beams, and a fragment of a floor on the projections at the\r\nnorth end of the lower one, in front of room 20. These balconies (pl.\r\n3) were apparently constructed in the same way as the structure that\r\ngives the name to the ruin called Balcony House; they seem to have\r\nbeen used by the inhabitants as a means of communication between\r\nneighboring rooms.\r\n\r\nNordenskiöld writes:[14]\r\n\r\n  The second story is furnished along the wall just mentioned, with\r\n  a balcony; the joists between the two stories project a couple of\r\n  feet, long poles lie across them parallel to the walls, the poles\r\n  are covered with a layer of cedar bast, and, finally with dried\r\n  clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIREPLACES\r\n\r\nThere are many fireplaces in Spruce-tree House, in rooms, plazas, and\r\ncourts. From their number it is evident that most of the cooking must\r\nhave been done by the ancients in the courts and plazas, rather than\r\nin the houses. The rooms are so small and so poorly ventilated that\r\nit would not be possible for any one to remain in them when fires are\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nThe top of the cave in which Spruce-tree House is built is covered\r\nwith soot, showing that formerly there were many fires in the courts\r\nand other open places of the village. In almost every corner of the\r\nbuildings in which a fire could be made the effect of smoke on the\r\nadjoining walls is discernible, while ashes are found in a depression\r\nin the floor. These fireplaces are very simple, consisting simply\r\nof square box-like structures bounded by a few flat stones set on\r\nedge. In other instances a depression in the floor bordered with\r\na low ridge of adobe served as a fireplace. There remains nothing\r\nto indicate that the inhabitants were familiar with chimneys or\r\nfirehoods as is the case among the modern pueblos. Certain small\r\nrooms suggest cook-houses, or places where _piki_, or paper bread,\r\nwas fried by the women on slabs of stone over a fire, but none of\r\nthese slabs were found in place. The fireplaces of the kivas are\r\nconsidered specially in an account of the structure of those rooms\r\n(see p. 18).\r\n\r\nNo evidence that Spruce-tree House people burnt coal was observed,\r\nalthough they were familiar with lignite and seams of coal underlie\r\ntheir mesa.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOORS AND WINDOWS\r\n\r\nThere are both doors and windows in the secular houses of Spruce-tree\r\nHouse, although the two rarely exist together. The windows, most of\r\nwhich are small square peep-holes or round orifices, look obliquely\r\ndownward, as if their purpose was rather for outlook than for air,\r\nthe latter being admitted as a rule through the doorway. (Pls. 10,\r\n11.)\r\n\r\nThe two types of doorways differ more in shape than in any other\r\nfeature. These types may be called the rectangular and the =T=-shaped\r\nform. Both are found at a high level, but it can not be discovered\r\nhow they could have been entered without ladders or notched logs.\r\nAlthough these modes of entrance were apparently often used it is\r\nremarkable that no traces of the logs have yet been found in the\r\nextensive excavations at Spruce-tree House. The =T=-shaped doorways\r\nare often filled in at the lower or narrow part, sometimes with\r\nstones rudely placed, oftentimes with good masonry, by which a\r\n=T=-shaped door is converted into one of square type. Doorways\r\nof both types are often completely filled in, leaving only their\r\noutlines on the sides of the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOORS AND ROOFS\r\n\r\nThe floors of the rooms are all smoothly plastered and, although\r\npurposely broken through in places by those in search of specimens,\r\nare otherwise in fairly good condition. In one of the rooms at the\r\nleft of the main court is a small round hole at the bottom of a\r\nconcave depression like a fireplace, the use of which is not known.\r\nMany of the floors sound hollow when struck, but this fact is not\r\nan indication of the presence of cavities below. In tiers of rooms\r\nthat rise above the first story the roof of one room forms the floor\r\nof the room above it. Wherever roofs still remain they are found to\r\nbe well constructed (pl. 9) and to resemble those of the old Hopi\r\nhouses. In Spruce-tree House the roofs are supported by timbers laid\r\nfrom one wall to another; these in turn support crossbeams on which\r\nwere placed layers of cedar bark covered with a thick coating of mud.\r\nIn several roofs hatchways are still to be seen, but in most cases\r\nentrances are at the sides. One second-story room has a fireplace\r\nconstructed like those on the ground floor or on the roof. Several\r\nfireplaces were found on the roofs of buildings one story high.\r\n\r\nThe largest slabs of stone used in the construction of the rooms of\r\nSpruce-tree House were generally made into lintels and thresholds.\r\nThe latter surfaces were often worn smooth by those crawling through\r\nthe opening and in some cases they show grooves for the insertion\r\nof the door slabs. Although the sides of the door are often upright\r\nslabs of stone these may be replaced by boards set in adobe plaster.\r\nSimilar split boards often form lintels.\r\n\r\nThe door was apparently a flat stone set in an adobe casing on the\r\ninside of the frame where it was held in position by a stick. Each\r\nend of this stick was inserted into an eyelet made of bent osiers\r\nfirmly set in the wall. Many of these broken eyelets can still be\r\nseen in the doorways and one or two are still entire. A slab of stone\r\nclosing one of the doorways is still in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVAS\r\n\r\nThere are eight circular subterranean rooms identified as ceremonial\r\nrooms, or _kivas_, in Spruce-tree House (pls. 12, 13). Beginning on\r\nthe north these kivas are designated by letters A-H. When excavation\r\nbegan small depressions full of fallen stones, with here and there\r\na stone buttress projecting out of the débris, were the only\r\nindications of the sites of these important chambers. The walls of\r\nkiva H were the most dilapidated and the most obscured of all, the\r\ncentral portion of the front wall of rooms 62 and 63 having fallen\r\ninto this chamber; added to the débris were the high walls of the\r\nround room, no. 69. Kiva G is the best-preserved kiva and kiva A the\r\nmost exceptional in construction. Kiva B, never seen by previous\r\ninvestigators, was in poor condition, its walls being almost\r\ncompletely broken down. Part of the wall of kiva A is double (pl.\r\n13), indicating a circular room built inside another room the shape\r\nof which inclines to oval, the former utilizing a portion of the wall\r\nof the latter. This kiva is also exceptional in being surrounded on\r\nthree sides by rooms, the fourth side being the wall of the cavern.\r\nFrom several considerations the author regards this as the oldest\r\nkiva in Spruce-tree House.\r\n\r\nThe typical structure of a Spruce-tree House kiva is as follows: Its\r\nform is circular or oval; the site is subterranean, the roof being\r\nlevel with the floor of the surrounding plaza. (Pls. 13-15.) Two\r\nwalls, an outer and an inner, inclose the room, the latter forming\r\nthe lower part. Upon the top of this lower wall rest six pedestals,\r\nwhich support the roof beams; the outer wall braces these pedestals\r\non one side. The spaces between these pedestals form recesses in\r\nwhich the floors extend a few feet above the floor of the room.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the kiva is generally plastered, but in some cases is\r\nsolid rock. The fireplace is a circular depression in the floor, its\r\npurpose being indicated by the wood ashes found therein. Its lining\r\nis ordinarily made of clay, which in some instances is replaced by\r\nstones set on edge.\r\n\r\nThe other important opening in the floor is one called _sipapû_, or\r\nsymbolic opening into the underworld. This is generally situated near\r\nthe center of the room, opposite the fireplace. This opening into the\r\nunderworld is barely large enough to admit the human hand and extends\r\nonly about a foot below the floor surface. It is commonly single, but\r\nin one kiva two of these orifices were detected. A similar symbolic\r\nopening occurs in modern Hopi kivas, as has been repeatedly described\r\nin the author’s accounts of pueblo ceremonials. An important\r\nstructure of a Spruce-tree House kiva is an upright slab of rock, or\r\na narrow thin wall of masonry, placed between the fireplace and the\r\nwall of the kiva. This object, sometimes called an altar, serves as\r\na deflector, its function being to distribute the air which enters\r\nthe kiva at the floor level through a vertical shaft, or ventilator.\r\nEvery kiva has at least one such deflector, a single fireplace, and\r\nthe sipapû, or ceremonial opening mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSeveral small cubby-holes, or receptacles for paint or small\r\nceremonial objects, generally occur in the lower walls of the kiva.\r\nIn addition to these there exist openings ample in size to admit\r\nthe human body, which serve different purposes. The first kind\r\ncommunicate directly with passageways through which one can pass from\r\nthe kiva into a neighboring room or plaza. Such a passageway in kiva\r\nE has steps near the opening in the floor of room 35. This entrance\r\nis not believed, however, to be the only way by which one could enter\r\nor leave this room, but was a private passage, the main entrance\r\nbeing through the roof. Another lateral passageway is found in kiva\r\nD, where there is an opening in the south wall communicating with\r\nthe open air by means of an exit in the floor of room 26; another\r\nopening is found in the wall on the east side. Kiva C has a lateral\r\nopening communicating with a vertical passageway which opens in the\r\nmiddle of the neighboring plaza. In addition to lateral openings all\r\nkivas without exception have others that serve as ventilators, as\r\nbefore mentioned, by which air is introduced on the floor level of\r\nthe kivas. The opening of this kind communicates through a horizontal\r\npassage with a vertical flue which finds its way outside the room\r\non a level with the roof. In cases where the kiva is situated near\r\nthe front wall these ventilators open through this wall by means of\r\nsquare apertures. All ventilator openings are in the west wall except\r\nthat of kiva A, which is the only one that has rooms on that side.\r\n\r\nThe construction of kiva roofs must have been a difficult problem\r\n(pls. 14, 15). The beams (L-1 to L-4) are supported by the six\r\npedestals (C) which stand upon the banquettes (A), and in turn are\r\nsupported by the outer wall (B) of the kiva. On top of each of these\r\npedestals is inserted a short stick (H) that served as a peg on\r\nwhich the inmates hung their ceremonial paraphernalia. The supports\r\nof the roof were cedar logs cut in suitable lengths by stone axes.\r\nThree logs were laid, connecting adjacent pedestals upon which they\r\nrested. These logs, which were large enough to support considerable\r\nweight, had been stripped of their bark. Upon these six beams were\r\nlaid an equal number of beams, spanning the intervals between those\r\nfirst placed, as shown in the illustration (pl. 15). Upon the\r\nlast-mentioned beams were still other logs extending across the kiva,\r\nas also shown in the plate.\r\n\r\nThe main weight of the roof was supported by two large logs which\r\nextended diametrically across the kiva from one wall to the wall\r\nopposite; they were placed a short distance apart, parallel with\r\neach other. The distance between these logs determines the width of\r\nthe doorway, two sides of which they form. The other two sides are\r\nformed by two beams (L-4) of moderate size, laid across these logs,\r\nthe space between them and the two beams being filled in with other\r\nlogs, forming a compact framework. No nails are necessary in a roof\r\nconstructed in this way.\r\n\r\nThe smaller interstices between the logs were filled in with small\r\nsticks and twigs, thus preventing soil from dropping into the room.\r\nOver the supports of the roof was spread a layer of cedar bark (M)\r\ncovered with mud (N), laid deep enough to bring the top of the roof\r\nto the level of the plaza in which the kiva is situated.\r\n\r\nNo kiva was found in which the plastering of the walls was supported\r\nby sticks, as sometimes occurs here, according to Nordenskiöld, and\r\nin one or more of the Hopi kivas. The plastering of the walls was\r\nplaced directly on the masonry.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the kiva walls were painted with various devices\r\nbefore their roofs fell in and other mutilation of the walls took\r\nplace. Among these designs parallel lines in white were common.\r\nSimilar lines are still made with meal on kiva walls in Hopi\r\nceremonies, as the author has often described. One of the pedestals\r\nof kiva A is decorated with a triangular figure on the margin of the\r\ndado, to which reference will be made later.\r\n\r\nThe author has found no conclusive answer to the question why\r\nthe kivas are built under ground and are circular in form. He\r\nbelieves both conditions to be survivals of ancient “pit-houses,”\r\nor subterranean dwellings of an antecedent people. In this\r\nexplanation the kiva is regarded as the oldest form of building in\r\nthe cliff-dwellings. We have the authority of observation bearing\r\non this point. Pit-dwellings are recorded from several ruins. In a\r\nrecent work Dr. Walter Hough figures and describes certain dwellings\r\nof subterranean character that are sometimes found in clusters,[15]\r\nwhile the present author has observed subterranean rooms so situated\r\nas to leave no doubt of their great antiquity.[16]\r\n\r\nThe form of the kiva is characteristic and may be used as a basis of\r\nclassification of pueblo culture. The people whose kivas are circular\r\ninhabited villages now ruins in the valley of the San Juan and its\r\ntributaries, in Chelly canyon, Chaco canyon, and on the western\r\nplateau of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe rectangular kiva is a structure altogether different from a\r\nround kiva, morphologically, genetically, and geographically. It\r\nis peculiar to the southern and western pueblo area, and while\r\nof later growth, should not be regarded as an evolution from the\r\ncircular kiva. Several authors have found in circular kivas survivals\r\nof nomadic architectural conditions, while the position of these\r\nrooms, in nearly every instance in front of the other rooms of\r\nthe cliff-dwelling, has led others to accept the theory that they\r\nwere later additions to the village, which should be ascribed to a\r\ndifferent race. It would seem that this hypothesis hardly conforms\r\nto facts, as some kivas have secular rooms in front of them which\r\nshow evidences of later construction. The strongest objection to the\r\ntheory that kivas are modified houses of nomads is the style of roof\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVA A\r\n\r\nThis room (pl. 13), which is the most northerly of all of the\r\nceremonial rooms of Spruce-tree House, is, the author believes, the\r\noldest. In construction this is a remarkable chamber. It is built\r\ndirectly under the cliff, which forms part of its walls. In addition\r\nto its site the remarkable features are its double walls, and its\r\nfloor on the level of the roofs of the other kivas. Although this\r\nkiva is not naturally subterranean, the earth and walls built up\r\naround it make it to all intents below the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the arrangement of walls and banquettes that there is\r\nhere presented an example of one room constructed inside of another,\r\nthe inner room utilizing for its wall a portion of the outer. The\r\ninner room is more nearly circular than the outer in which it was\r\nsubsequently built. In this inner room as in other kivas there are\r\nsix banquettes, and the same number of pedestals to support the roof.\r\nThree of these pedestals are common to both rooms. The floor of this\r\nroom shows nothing peculiar. It has a fire hole, a sipapû, and a\r\ndeflector, or low wall between the fire hole and the entrance into\r\nthe horizontal passageway of the ventilator. The ventilator itself\r\nopens just outside the west wall through a passageway, the walls\r\nof which stand on the wall of a neighboring room. No plaza of any\r\nconsiderable size surrounded the top of this kiva.\r\n\r\nIn order to get an idea as to how many rectangular rooms naturally\r\naccompany a single kiva, the author examined the ground plans of\r\nsuch cliff-dwellings as are known to have but one circular kiva,\r\nthe majority of these being in the Chelly canyon. While it was not\r\npossible to determine the point satisfactorily, it was found that in\r\nseveral instances the circular kiva lies in the middle of several\r\nrooms, a fact which would seem to indicate that it was built first\r\nand that the square rooms were added later. Several clusters of\r\nrooms, each cluster having one kiva, closely resemble kiva A and its\r\nsurroundings, in both form and structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVA B\r\n\r\nThe walls of this subterranean room had escaped all previous\r\nobservers. They are very much dilapidated, being wholly concealed\r\nwhen work of excavation began. A large old cedar tree growing in\r\nthe middle of this room led the author to abandon its complete\r\nexcavation, which promised little return either in enlarging our\r\nknowledge of the ground plan of Spruce-tree House or in shedding\r\nadditional light on the culture of its prehistoric inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVAS C AND D\r\n\r\nThe two kivas, C and D, the roofs of which form the greater part of\r\nplaza C, logically belong together in our consideration. One of these\r\nrooms, C, was roofed over by the author, who followed as a model the\r\nroofs of the two kivas of the House with the Square Tower (Peabody\r\nHouse); the other shows a few log supports of an original roof—the\r\nonly Spruce-tree House kiva of which this is true.\r\n\r\nNot only was the roof of the kiva restored but its walls were well\r\nrepaired, so that it now presents all the essential features of\r\nan ancient kiva. On one of the banquettes of this room the author\r\nfound a vase which was evidently a receptacle for pigments or other\r\nceremonial paraphernalia.\r\n\r\nKiva D has a passageway leading into room 26 and a second opening in\r\nthe west wall on the floor level, besides a ventilator of the type\r\ncommon to all kivas. The top of the opening in the west wall appears\r\ncovered with a flat stone in one of the photographic views (plate 11).\r\n\r\nThe wall in front of the village in the neighborhood of kivas C and\r\nD was wholly concealed by débris when work was begun on this part of\r\nthe ruin. Excavation of this débris showed that opposite each kiva\r\nthere was an opening with which the ventilator is believed formerly\r\nto have been connected. There seems to have been a low-storied house,\r\npossibly a cooking-place, provided with a roof, in an interval\r\nbetween kivas C and D; in the floor of the plaza at this point a\r\nwell-made fire hole was uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVA E\r\n\r\nKiva E is one of the finest which was excavated, showing all the\r\ntypical structures of these characteristic rooms; it almost fills\r\nthe plaza in which it is situated. The exceptional feature of this\r\nroom is a passageway through the west wall. Room 35 may have been the\r\nhouse of a chief or of a priest who kept in it his masks or other\r\nceremonial paraphernalia. A similar opening in the wall of one of the\r\nHopi kivas communicates with a dark room in which are kept altars and\r\nother ceremonial objects. When such a passageway into a dark chamber\r\nis not in use it is closed by a slab of stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVA F\r\n\r\nKiva F might be designated the Spruce-tree kiva from the large\r\nspruce tree that formerly grew near its outer wall. Its stump is now\r\nvisible, but the tree lies extended in the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe walls of this kiva were poorly preserved, and only two of the\r\npedestals were in place. The walls were repaired and the roof\r\nrestored. This room is situated outside the walls, and in that\r\nrespect recalls kiva B, described above. The ventilator opening of\r\nthis kiva is situated on the south instead of on the west side of\r\nthe room, as is the rule in other kivas. The large size of this room\r\nwould indicate that it was of great importance in the religious\r\nceremonials of the prehistoric inhabitants of Spruce-tree House, but\r\nall indications point to its late construction.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVA G\r\n\r\nKiva G was so well preserved that its walls were thoroughly restored;\r\nit now stands as typical of one of these rooms in which the several\r\ncharacteristic features may be seen. For the guidance of visitors,\r\nletters or numbers accompanied by explanatory labels were painted by\r\nthe author on the walls of the kiva.\r\n\r\nKiva G lies just below and in front of the round tower of Spruce-tree\r\nHouse, which is situated in the neighborhood of the main court, and\r\nmay therefore be looked on as one of the most important kivas in the\r\ncliff-dwelling.[18] The solid stone floor of this room had been cut\r\ndown about 8 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIVA H\r\n\r\nKiva H, the largest in Spruce-tree House, contained some of the best\r\nspecimens excavated by the author. Its shape is oval rather than\r\ncircular, and it fills the whole space inclosed by walls of rooms\r\non three sides. In the neighborhood of kiva H is a comparatively\r\nspacious plaza which is bounded on the front by a low wall, now\r\nrepaired, and on the other sides are high rooms. The plaza containing\r\nthis kiva was ample for ceremonial dances which undoubtedly formerly\r\noccurred in it. The walls of kiva H formerly had a marked pinkish\r\ncolor, showing no sign of blackening by smoke except in places.\r\nCharred roof beams were excavated at one place, however, and charcoal\r\noccurred deep under the débris that filled this room.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR ROOMS OTHER THAN KIVAS\r\n\r\nThere are two rooms (nos. 54, 69) of circular shape in Spruce-tree\r\nHouse, one of which resembles the “tower” in the Cliff Palace. This\r\nroom (no. 54) is situated to the right hand of the main court above\r\nreferred to, into which it projects without attachment except on one\r\nside. Its walls have two small windows or openings which have been\r\ncalled doorways, and are of a single story in height. This tower was\r\napparently ceremonial in character.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to mention that remains of a fire hole containing\r\nwood ashes occur in the floor on one side of this room, and that the\r\nwalls are pierced with several small holes opening at an angle. Only\r\nfoundations remain of the other circular room. It was situated on the\r\nsouth side of the open space containing kiva H and formed a bastion\r\nat the north end of the front wall. The floor of this room was wholly\r\ncovered with fallen débris and its ground plan was wholly concealed\r\nwhen the excavations began; it was only with considerable difficulty\r\nthat the foundation walls could be traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREMONIAL ROOM OTHER THAN KIVA\r\n\r\nWhile the circular subterranean rooms above mentioned are believed\r\nto be the most common ceremonial chambers, there are others in the\r\ncliff-dwellings which were undoubtedly used for similar purposes.\r\nOne of these, designated room 12, adjoins the mortuary room (11) and\r\nopens on the plaza C, D. In some respects the form of this room is\r\nsimilar to an “estufa of singular construction” described and figured\r\nin Nordenskiöld’s account of Cliff Palace. Certain distinctive\r\ncharacters of this room separate it on one side from a kiva and on\r\nthe other from a dwelling. In the first place, it lacks the circular\r\nform and subterranean site. The six pedestals which universally\r\nsupport the roofs are likewise absent. In fact they are not needed\r\nbecause in this room the top of the cave serves as the roof. A\r\nbank extends around three sides of the room, the fourth side being\r\nthe perpendicular wall of the cliff. In the southeast corner is an\r\nopening, which recalls that in the “estufa of singular construction”\r\ndescribed by Nordenskiöld.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTUARY ROOM\r\n\r\nRoom 9 may be designated a mortuary room from the fact that at least\r\nfour human skeletons and accompanying offerings have been found in\r\nits floor. Three of those, excavated several years ago, were said\r\nto have been infants; the skull of one of these was figured and\r\ndescribed by Prof. G. Retzius, in Nordenskiöld’s memoir. The skeleton\r\nfound by the author was that of an adult and was accompanied by\r\nmortuary offerings. The skull and some of the larger bones were well\r\npreserved.[20] Evidently the doorway of this room had been walled up\r\nand there are indications that the burials took place at intervals,\r\nthe last occurring before the desertion of the village.\r\n\r\nThe presence of burials in the floors of rooms in Spruce-tree House\r\nwas to be expected, as the practice of thus disposing of the dead\r\nwas known from other ruins of the Park, but it has not been pointed\r\nout that we have in this region good evidence of several successive\r\ninterments in the same room. The existence of this intramural burial\r\nroom in the south end of the ruin is one of the facts that can be\r\nadduced pointing to the conclusion that this part of the ruin is very\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL LEDGE-HOUSES\r\n\r\nNot far from the Spruce-tree House, situated in the same canyon,\r\nthere are small one-room houses perched on narrow ledges situated\r\ngenerally a little higher than the cave containing the main ruin.\r\nAlthough it is difficult to enter some of these houses, members of\r\nthe author’s party visited all of them, and two of the workmen slept\r\nin a small ledge-house on the west side of the canyon. Except in rare\r\ncases these smaller houses can not be considered dwellings; they may\r\nhave been used for storage, although it is more than likely that they\r\nwere resorted to by priests when they wished to pray for rain or to\r\nperform certain ceremonies. The ledge-houses form a distinct type\r\nof ruin; they are rarely multiple-chambered and therefore are not\r\ncapacious enough for more than one family.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAIRWAYS\r\n\r\nThere are two or three old stairway trails in the neighborhood of\r\nSpruce-tree House. These consist of a succession of holes for hands\r\nand feet, or of a series of pits cut in the face of the cliff at\r\nconvenient distances. One of these ancient trails is situated on the\r\nwest side of the canyon not far from the modern trail to the spring;\r\nthe other lies on the east side a few feet north of the ruin. Both\r\nof these trails were appropriately labeled for the convenience of\r\nfuture visitors. There is still another ancient trail along the east\r\ncanyon wall south of the ruin. Although all these trails are somewhat\r\nobscure, it is hoped that they can be readily found by means of the\r\nlabels posted near them.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFUSE-HEAPS\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the buildings are two large open spaces which, from\r\ntheir positions relative to the main street, may be called the\r\nnorthern and southern refuse-heaps. They merit more than passing\r\nconsideration. The former, being the larger, has not yet been\r\nthoroughly cleared out, although pretty well dug over before the\r\nrepair work was begun. The author completely cleared out the southern\r\nrefuse-heap and excavated to its floor.[21]\r\n\r\nThe southern recess opens directly into the main street and is\r\nflooded with light. Its floor is covered with large fragments of\r\nrock that have fallen from the cliff above. The spaces between these\r\nbowlders were filled with débris and the bowlders themselves were\r\ncovered with the same accumulations the removal of which was no small\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR ANTIQUITIES\r\n\r\nThe rooms and refuse-heaps of Spruce-tree House had been pretty\r\nthoroughly ransacked for specimens by those who preceded the author,\r\nso that few minor antiquities were expected to come to light in the\r\nexcavation and repair work. Notwithstanding this, however, a fair\r\ncollection, containing some unique specimens and many representative\r\nobjects, was made, and is now in the National Museum where it will\r\nbe preserved and be accessible to all students. Considering the\r\nfact that most of the specimens previously abstracted from this\r\nruin have been scattered in all directions and are now in many\r\nhands, it is doubtful whether a collection of any considerable size\r\nfrom Spruce-tree House exists in any other public museum. In order\r\nto render this account more comprehensive, references are made in\r\nthe following pages to objects from Spruce-tree House elsewhere\r\ndescribed, now in other collections. These references, quoted from\r\nNordenskiöld, the only writer on this subject, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Plate XVIII: 2. a and b. Strongly flattened cranium of a child.\r\n  Found in a room in Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  Plate XXXIV: 4. Stone axe of porphyrite. Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  Plate XXXV: 2. Rough-hewn stone axe of quartzite. Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  Plate XXXIX: 6. Implement of black slate. Form peculiar (see the\r\n  text). Found in Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  [In the text the last-mentioned specimen is again referred to, as\r\n  follows:]\r\n\r\n  I have still to mention a number of stone implements the use of\r\n  which is unknown to me, first some large (15-30 cm.), flat, and\r\n  rather thick stones of irregular shape and much worn at the edges\r\n  (Pl. XXXIX: 4, 5), second a singular object consisting of a thin\r\n  slab of black slate, and presenting the appearance shown in Pl.\r\n  XXXIX: 6. My collection contains only one such implement, but among\r\n  the objects in Wetherill’s possession I saw several. They are all\r\n  of exactly the same shape and of almost the same size. I cannot\r\n  say in what manner this slab of slate was employed. Perhaps it is\r\n  a last for the plaiting of sandals or the cutting of moccasins. In\r\n  size it corresponds pretty nearly to the foot of an adult.\r\n\r\n  Plate XL: 5. Several _ulnæ_ and _radii_ of birds (turkeys) tied\r\n  on a buckskin string and probably used as an amulet. Found in\r\n  Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  Plate XLIII: 6. Bundle of 19 sticks of hard wood, probably employed\r\n  in some kind of knitting or crochet work. The pins are pointed at\r\n  one end, blunt at the other, and black with wear. They are held\r\n  together by a narrow band of yucca. Found in Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  Plate XLIV: 2. Similar to the preceding basket, but smaller. Found\r\n  in Sprucetree House....\r\n\r\n  [The “preceding basket” is thus described in explanation of the\r\n  figure (Pl. XLIV: 1):] Basket of woven yucca in two different\r\n  colors, a neat pattern being thus attained. The strips of yucca\r\n  running in a vertical direction are of the natural yellowish brown,\r\n  the others (in horizontal direction) darker....\r\n\r\n  Plate XLV: 1(95) and 2(663): Small baskets of yucca, of plain\r\n  colour and of handsomely plaited pattern. Found: 1 in ruin 9, 2 in\r\n  Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\n  Plate XLVIII: 4(674). Mat of plaited reeds, originally 1.2 × 1.2\r\n  m., but damaged in transportation. Found in Sprucetree House.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the foregoing that the following specimens have been\r\ndescribed and figured by Nordenskiöld, from Spruce-tree House: (1)\r\nA child’s skull; (2) 2 stone axes; (3) a slab of black slate; (4)\r\nseveral bird bones used for amulet; (5) bundle of sticks; (6) 2 small\r\nbaskets; (7) a plaited mat.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the specimens above referred to, the majority of\r\nwhich are duplicated in the author’s collection, no objects from\r\nSpruce-tree House are known to have been described or figured\r\nelsewhere, so that there are embraced in the present account\r\npractically all printed references to known material from this ruin.\r\nBut there is no doubt that other specimens as yet unmentioned in\r\nprint still exist in public collections in Colorado, and later these\r\nalso may be described and figured. From the nature of the author’s\r\nexcavations and method of collecting, little hope remains that\r\nadditional specimens may be obtained from rooms in Spruce-tree House,\r\nbut the northern refuse-heap situated at the back of the cavern may\r\nyet yield a few good objects. This still awaits complete scientific\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\nThe author’s collection from Spruce-tree House, the choice specimens\r\nof which are now in the National Museum, numbers several hundred\r\nobjects. All the duplicates and heavy specimens, about equal in\r\nnumber to the lighter ones, were left at the ruin where they are\r\navailable for future study. These are mostly stone mauls, metates\r\nand large grinding implements, and broken bowls and vases. The\r\nabsence from Spruce-tree House of certain characteristic objects\r\nwidely distributed among Southwestern ruins is regarded as worthy\r\nof comment. It will be noticed in looking over the author’s\r\ncollection that there are no specimens of marine shells, or of\r\nturquoise ornaments or obsidian flakes, from the excavations made at\r\nSpruce-tree House. This fact is significant, meaning either that the\r\nformer inhabitants of this village were ignorant of these objects or\r\nthat the excavators failed to find what may have existed. The author\r\naccepts the former explanation, that these objects were not in use by\r\nthe inhabitants of Spruce-tree House, their ignorance of them having\r\nbeen due mainly to their restricted commercial dealings with their\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nObsidian, one of the rarest stones in the cliff-dwellings of the Mesa\r\nVerde, as a rule is characteristic of very old ruins and occurs in\r\nthose having kivas of the round type, to the south and west of that\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt is said that turquoise has been found in the Mesa Verde ruins.\r\nThe author has seen a beautiful bird mosaic with inlaid turquoise\r\nfrom one of the ruins near Cortez in Montezuma valley. This specimen\r\nis made of hematite with turquoise eyes and neckband of the same\r\nmaterial; the feathers are represented by stripes of inlaid\r\nturquoise. Also inlaid in turquoise in the back is an hourglass\r\nfigure, recalling designs drawn in outline on ancient pottery.\r\n\r\nThe absence of bracelets, armlets, and finger rings of sea shells,\r\nobjects so numerous in the ruins along the Little Colorado and the\r\nGila, may be explained by lack of trade, due to culture isolation.\r\nThe people of Mesa Verde appear not to have come in contact with\r\ntribes who traded these shells, consequently they never obtained\r\nthem. The absence of culture connection in this direction tells\r\nin favor of the theory that the ancestors of the Mesa Verde\r\npeople did not come from the southwest or the west, where shells\r\nare so abundant. Although not proving much either way by itself,\r\nthis theory, when taken with other facts which admit of the same\r\ninterpretation, is significant. The inhabitants of Spruce-tree House\r\n(the same is true of the other Mesa Verde people) had an extremely\r\nnarrow mental horizon. They obtained little in trade from their\r\nneighbors and were quite unconscious of the extent of the culture of\r\nwhich they were representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTERY\r\n\r\nThe women of Spruce-tree House were expert potters and decorated\r\ntheir wares in a simple but artistic manner. Until we have more\r\nmaterial it would be gratuitous to assume that the ceramic art\r\nobjects of all the Mesa Verde ruins are identical in texture, colors,\r\nand symbolism, and the only way to determine how great are the\r\nvariations, if any, would be to make an accurate comparative study of\r\npottery from different localities. Thus far the quantity of material\r\navailable does not justify comparison even of the ruins of this\r\nmesa, but there is a good beginning of a collection from Spruce-tree\r\nHouse. The custom of placing in graves offerings of food for the\r\ndead has preserved several good bowls, and although whole pieces are\r\nrare fragments are found in abundance. Eighteen earthenware vessels,\r\nincluding those repaired and restored from fragments, rewarded the\r\nauthor’s excavations at Spruce-tree House. Some of these vessels bear\r\na rare and beautiful symbolism which is quite different from that\r\nknown from Arizona. The few plates (16-20) here given to illustrate\r\nthese symbols are offered more as a basis for future study and\r\ncomparisons than as an exhaustive representation of ceramics from one\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nThe number and variety of pieces of pottery figured from the Mesa\r\nVerde cliff-dwellings have not been great. An examination of\r\nNordenskiöld’s memoir reveals the fact that he represents about 50\r\nspecimens of pottery; several of these were obtained by purchase, and\r\nothers came from Chelly canyon, the pottery of which is strikingly\r\nlike that of Mesa Verde. The majority of specimens obtained by\r\nNordenskiöld’s excavations were from Step House, not a single ceramic\r\nobject from Spruce-tree House being figured. So far as the author\r\ncan ascertain, the ceramic specimens here considered are the first\r\nrepresentatives of this art from Spruce-tree House that have been\r\ndescribed or figured, but there may be many other specimens from this\r\nlocality awaiting description and it is to be hoped that some day\r\nthese may be made known to the scientific world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS\r\n\r\nEvery form of pottery represented by Nordenskiöld, with the exception\r\nof that which he styles a “lamp-shaped” vessel and of certain platter\r\nforms with indentations, occurs in the collection here considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Lid of jar.]\r\n\r\nNordenskiöld figures a jar provided with a lid, both sides of which\r\nare shown.[22] It would seem that this lid (fig. 1),[23] unlike those\r\nprovided with knobs, found by the author, had two holes near the\r\ncenter. The decoration on the top of the lid of one of the author’s\r\nspecimens resembles that figured by Nordenskiöld, but other specimens\r\ndiffer from his as shown in figure 1. The specimens having raised\r\nlips and lids are perforated in the edges of the openings, with one\r\nor more holes for strings or handles. As bowls of this form are found\r\nin sacred rooms they would seem to have been connected with worship.\r\nThe author believes that they served the same purposes as the netted\r\ngourds of the Hopi. Most of the ceramic objects in Spruce-tree House\r\nwere in fragments when found.[24] Some of these objects have been\r\nrepaired and it is remarkable that so much good material for the\r\nstudy of the symbolism has been obtained in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Repaired pottery.]\r\n\r\nBlack-and-white ware is the most common and the characteristic\r\npainted pottery, but fragmentary specimens of a reddish ware occur.\r\nOne peculiarity in the lips of food bowls from Spruce-tree House\r\n(pls. 16-18) is that their rims are flat, instead of rounded as in\r\nmore western prehistoric ruins, like Sikyatki. Food bowls are rarely\r\nconcave at the base.\r\n\r\nNo fragments of glazed pottery were found, although the surfaces of\r\nsome species were very smooth and glossy from constant rubbing with\r\nsmoothing stones. Several pieces of pottery were unequally fired,\r\nso that a vitreous mass, or blotch, was evident on one side. Smooth\r\nvessels and those made of coiled ware, which were covered with soot\r\nfrom fires, were evidently used in cooking.\r\n\r\nSeveral specimens showed evidences of having been broken and\r\nafterwards mended by the owners (fig. 2); holes were drilled near\r\nthe line of fracture and the two parts tied together; even the yucca\r\nstrings still remain in the holes, showing where fragments were\r\nunited. In figure 3 there is represented a fragment of a handle of an\r\namphora on which is tied a tightly-woven cord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Handle with attached cord.]\r\n\r\nNot a very great variety of pottery forms was brought to light in\r\nthe operations at Spruce-tree House. Those that were found are\r\nessentially the types common throughout the Southwest, and may be\r\nclassified as follows: (1) Large jars, or ollas; (2) flat food bowls;\r\n(3) cups and mugs; (4) ladles or dippers (fig. 4); (5) canteens; (6)\r\nglobular bowls. An exceptional form is a globular bowl with a raised\r\nlip like a sugar bowl (pl. 19, _f_). This form is never seen in other\r\nprehistoric ruins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Ladle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\n\r\nClassified by structure, the pottery found in the Spruce-tree\r\nHouse ruin falls into two groups, coiled ware and smooth ware, the\r\nlatter either with or without decoration. The white ware has black\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Handle of mug.]\r\n\r\nThe bases of the mugs (pl. 19) from Spruce-tree House, like those\r\nfrom other Mesa Verde ruins, have a greater diameter than the lips.\r\nThese mugs are tall and their handles are of generous size. One of\r\nthe mugs found in this ruin has a =T=-shaped hole in its handle (fig.\r\n5), recalling in this particular a mug collected in 1895 by the\r\nauthor at Awatobi, a Hopi ruin.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful specimen of canteen found at Spruce-tree House is\r\nhere shown in plate 20.\r\n\r\nThe coiled ware of Spruce-tree House, as of all the Mesa Verde ruins,\r\nis somewhat finer than the coiled ware of Sikyatki. Although no\r\ncomplete specimen was found, many fragments were collected, some of\r\nwhich are of great size. This kind of ware was apparently the most\r\nabundant and also the most fragile. As a rule these vessels show\r\nmarks of fire, soot, or smoke on the outside, and were evidently\r\nused as cooking vessels. On account of their fragile character they\r\ncould not have been used for carrying water, for, with one or two\r\nexceptions, they would not be equal to the strain. In decoration of\r\ncoiled ware the women of Spruce-tree House resorted to an ingenious\r\nmodification of the coils, making triangular figures, spirals, or\r\ncrosses in relief, which were usually affixed to the necks of the\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe symbolism on the pottery of Spruce-tree House is essentially that\r\nof a cliff-dwelling culture, being simple in general characters.\r\nAlthough it has many affinities with the archaic symbols of the\r\nPueblos, it has not the same complexity. The reason for this can be\r\nreadily traced to that same environmental influence which caused the\r\ncommunities to seek the cliffs for protection. The very isolation of\r\nthe Mesa Verde cliff-dwellings prevented the influx of new ideas and\r\nconsequently the adoption of new symbols to represent them. Secure\r\nin their cliffs, the inhabitants were not subject to the invasion\r\nof strange clans nor could new customs be introduced, so that\r\nconservatism ruled their art as well as their life in general. Only\r\nsimple symbols were present because there was no outside stimulus or\r\ncompetition to make them complex.\r\n\r\nOn classification of Spruce-tree House pottery according to\r\ntechnique, irrespective of its form, two divisions appear: (1)\r\nCoiled ware showing the coils externally, and (2) smooth ware with\r\nor without decorations. Structurally both divisions are the same,\r\nalthough their outward appearance is different.\r\n\r\nThe smooth ware may be decorated with incised lines or pits, but is\r\npainted often in one color. All the decorated vessels obtained by the\r\nauthor at Spruce-tree House belong to what is called black-and-white\r\nware, by which is meant pottery having a thin white slip covering the\r\nwhole surface upon which black pictures are painted. Occasionally\r\nfragments of a reddish brown cup were found, while red ware bearing\r\nwhite decorative figures was recovered from the Mesa Verde; but none\r\nof these are ascribed to Spruce-tree House or were collected by the\r\nauthor. The general geographical distribution of this black-and-white\r\nware, not taking into account sporadic examples, is about the same\r\nas that of the circular kivas, but it is also found where circular\r\nkivas are unknown, as in the upper part of the valley of the Little\r\nColorado.\r\n\r\nThe black-and-white ware of modern pueblos, as Zuñi and Hano, the\r\nlatter the Tewan pueblo among the Hopi, is of late introduction from\r\nthe Rio Grande; prehistoric Zuñi ware is unlike that of modern Zuñi,\r\nbeing practically identical in character with that of the other\r\nancient pueblos of the Little Colorado and its tributaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECORATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Fragment of pottery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Zigzag ornament.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the decoration on pottery from Spruce-tree House is\r\nsimple, being composed mainly of geometrical patterns. Life forms\r\nare rare, when present consisting chiefly of birds or rude figures\r\nof mammals painted on the outside of food bowls (fig. 6). The\r\ngeometrical figures are principally rectilinear, there being a great\r\npaucity of spirals and curved lines. The tendency to arrange rows of\r\ndots along straight lines is marked in Mesa Verde pottery and occurs\r\nalso in dados of house walls. There are many examples of stepped\r\nor terraced figures which are so arranged in pairs that the spaces\r\nbetween the terraces form zigzag bands, as shown in figure 7. A band\r\nextending from the upper left hand, to the lower right hand, angle\r\nof the rectangle that incloses the two terraced figures, may be\r\ndesignated a sinistral, and when at right angles a dextral, terraced\r\nfigure (fig. 8). Specimens from Spruce-tree House show considerable\r\nmodification in these two types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Sinistral and dextral stepped figures.]\r\n\r\nWith exception of the terrace the triangle (fig. 9) is possibly the\r\nmost common geometrical decoration on Spruce-tree House pottery. Most\r\nof the triangles may be bases of terraced figures, for by cutting\r\nnotches on the longer sides of these triangles, sinistral or dextral\r\nstepped figures (as the case may be) result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Triangle ornament.]\r\n\r\nThe triangles may be placed in a row, united in hourglass forms, or\r\ndistributed in other ways. These triangles may be equilateral or\r\none of the angles may be very acute. Although the possibilities of\r\ntriangle combinations are almost innumerable the different forms can\r\nbe readily recognized. The dot is a common form of decoration, and\r\nparallel lines also are much used. Many bowls are decorated with\r\nhachure, and with line ornaments mostly rectilinear.\r\n\r\nThe volute plays a part, although not a conspicuous one, in\r\nSpruce-tree House pottery decoration. Simple volutes are of two\r\nkinds, one in which the figure-coils follow the direction of the\r\nhands of the clock (dextral); the other, in which they take an\r\nopposite direction (sinistral). The outer end of the volute may\r\nterminate in a triangle or other figure, which may be notched,\r\nserrated, or otherwise modified. A compound sinistral volute is one\r\nwhich is sinistral until it reaches the center, when it turns into\r\na dextral volute extending to the periphery. The compound dextral\r\nvolute is exactly the reverse of the last-mentioned, starting as\r\ndextral and ending as sinistral. If, as frequently happens, there is\r\na break in the lines at the middle, the figure may be called a broken\r\ncompound volute. Two volutes having different axes are known as a\r\ncomposite volute, sinistral or dextral as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Meander.]\r\n\r\nThe meander (fig. 10) is also important in Spruce-tree House or Mesa\r\nVerde pottery decoration. The form of meander homologous to the\r\nvolute may be classified in the same terms as the volute, into (1)\r\nsimple sinistral meander; (2) simple dextral meander; (3) compound\r\nsinistral meander; (4) compound dextral meander; and (5) composite\r\nmeander. These meanders, like the volutes, may be accompanied by\r\nparallel lines or by rows of dots enlarged, serrated, notched, or\r\notherwise modified.\r\n\r\nIn some beautiful specimens a form of hachure, or combination of\r\nmany parallel lines with spirals and meanders, is introduced in a\r\nvery effective way. This kind of decoration is very rare on old Hopi\r\n(Sikyatki) pottery, but is common on late Zuñi and Hano ceramics,\r\nboth of which are probably derived from the Rio Grande region.\r\n\r\nLines, straight or zigzag, constitute important elements in\r\nSpruce-tree House pottery decoration. These may be either parallel,\r\nor crossed so as to form reticulated areas.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines rows of dots or of triangular enlargements may\r\nbe introduced. The latter may be simply serrations, dentations, or\r\ntriangles of considerable size, sometimes bent over, resembling\r\npointed bands.\r\n\r\nCurved figures are rarely used, but such as are found are\r\ncharacteristic. Concentric rings, with or without central dots, are\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\nRectangles apparently follow the same general rules as circles, and\r\nare also sometimes simple, with or without central dots.\r\n\r\nThe triangle is much more common as a decorative motive than\r\nthe circle or the rectangle, variety being brought about by the\r\ndifference in length of the sides. The hourglass formed by two\r\ntriangles with one angle of each united is common. The quail’s-head\r\ndesign, or triangle having two parallel marks on an extension at one\r\nangle, is not as common as on Little Colorado pottery and that from\r\nthe Gila valley.\r\n\r\nAs in all ceramics from the San Juan area, the stepped figures are\r\nmost abundant. There are two types of stepped figures, the sinistral\r\nand the dextral, according as the steps pass from left to right or\r\nvice versa. The color of the two stepped figures may be black, or\r\none or both may have secondary ornamentation in forms of hachure or\r\nnetwork. One may be solid black, the other filled in with lines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned geometrical figures, the S-shaped\r\ndesign is common; when doubled, this forms the cross called swastika.\r\nThe S figure is of course generally curved but may be angular, in\r\nwhich case the cross is more evident. One bowl has the S figure on\r\nthe outside. All of the above-mentioned designs admit of variations\r\nand two or more are often combined in Spruce-tree House pottery,\r\nwhich is practically the same in type as that of the whole Mesa Verde\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERAMIC AREAS\r\n\r\nWhile it is yet too early in our study of prehistoric pueblo\r\nculture to make or define subcultural areas, it is possible to\r\nrecognize provisionally certain areas having features in common,\r\nwhich differ from other areas.[25] It has already been shown that\r\nthe form of the subterranean ceremonial room can be used as a basis\r\nof classification. If pottery symbols are taken as the basis, it\r\nwill be found that there are at least two great subsections in the\r\npueblo country coinciding with the two divisions recognized as the\r\nresult of study of the form of sacred rooms—the northeastern and the\r\nsouthwestern region or, for brevity, the northern and the southern\r\narea. In the former region lie, besides the Mesa Verde and the San\r\nJuan valley, Chaco and Chelly canyons; in the latter, the ruins of\r\n“great houses” along the Gila and Salt rivers.\r\n\r\nFrom these two centers radiated in ancient times two types of pottery\r\nsymbols expressive of two distinct cultures, each ceremonially\r\ndistinct and, architecturally speaking, characteristic. The line of\r\njunction of the influences of these two subcultural areas practically\r\nfollows the Little Colorado river, the valley of which is the site\r\nof a third ceramic subculture area; this is mixed, being related on\r\none side to the northern, on the other to the southern, region. The\r\ncourse of this river and its tributaries has determined a trail of\r\nmigration, which in turn has spread this intermingled ceramic art far\r\nand wide. The geographical features of the Little Colorado basin have\r\nprevented the evolution of characteristic ceramic culture in any part\r\nof the region.\r\n\r\nUsing color and symbolism of pottery as a basis of classification,\r\nthe author has provisionally divided the sedentary people of the\r\nSouthwest into the following divisions, or has recognized the\r\nfollowing ceramic areas: (1) Hopi area, including the wonderful\r\nware of Sikyatki, Awatobi, and the ruins on Antelope mesa, at old\r\nMishongnovi, Shumopavi and neighboring ruins; (2) Casa Grande area;\r\n(3) San Juan area, including Mesa Verde, Chaco canyon, Chelly canyon\r\nas far west as St. George, Utah, and Navaho mountain, Arizona; (4)\r\nLittle Colorado area, including Zuñi. The pottery of Casas Grandes in\r\nChihuahua is allied in colors but not in symbols to old Hopi ware. So\r\nlittle is known of the old Piros ceramics and of the pottery from all\r\nruins east of the Rio Grande, that they are not yet classified. The\r\nceramics from the region west of the Rio Grande are related to the\r\nSan Juan and Chaco areas.\r\n\r\nThe Spruce-tree House pottery belongs to the San Juan area, having\r\nsome resemblance and relationship to that from the lower course of\r\nthe Little Colorado. It is markedly different from the pottery of\r\nthe Hopi area and has only the most distant resemblance to that from\r\nCasas Grandes.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPI AREA\r\n\r\nThe Hopi area is well distinguished by specialized symbols which\r\nare not duplicated elsewhere in the pueblo area. Among these may be\r\nmentioned the symbol for the feather, and a band representing the sky\r\nwith design of a mythic bird attached. As almost all pueblo symbols,\r\nancient and modern, are represented on old Hopi ware, and in addition\r\nother designs peculiar to it, the logical conclusion is that these\r\nHopi symbols are specialized in origin.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of a ceramic area in the neighborhood of the modern\r\nHopi mesas is due to special causes, and points to a long residence\r\nin that locality. It would seem from traditions that the earliest\r\nHopi people came from the east, and that the development of a purely\r\nHopi ceramic culture in the region now occupied by this people\r\ntook place before any great change due to southern immigration had\r\noccurred. The entrance of Patki and other clans from the south\r\nstrongly affected the old Hopi culture, which was purest in Sikyatki,\r\nbut even there it remained distinctive. The advent of the eastern\r\nclans in large numbers after the great rebellion in 1680, especially\r\nof the Tanoan families about 1710, radically changed the symbolism,\r\nmaking modern Hopi ware completely eastern in this respect. The old\r\nsymbolism, the germ of which was eastern, as shown by the characters\r\nemployed, almost completely vanished, being replaced by an introduced\r\nsymbolism.\r\n\r\nIn order scientifically to appreciate the bearing on the migration of\r\nclans, of symbolism on pottery, we must bear in mind that a radical\r\ndifference in such symbolism as has taken place at the Hopi villages\r\nmay have occurred elsewhere as well, although there is no evidence of\r\na change of this kind having occurred at Spruce-tree House.\r\n\r\nThe author includes under Hopi ware that found at the Hopi ruins\r\nSikyatki, Shumopavi, and Awatobi, the collection from the first-named\r\nbeing typical. Some confusion has been introduced by others into the\r\nstudy of old Hopi ware by including in it, under the name “Tusayan\r\npottery,” the white-and-black ware of the Chelly canyon.[27] There\r\nis a close resemblance between the pottery of Chelly canyon and\r\nthat of Mesa Verde, but only the most distant relationship between\r\ntrue Hopi ware and that of Chelly canyon. The latter belong in fact\r\nto two distinct areas, and differ in color, symbolism, and general\r\ncharacters. In so far as the Hopi ware shares its symbolism with the\r\nother geographical areas of the eastern region, to the same extent\r\nthere is kinship in culture. In more distant ruins the pottery\r\ncontains a greater admixture of symbols foreign to Mesa Verde. These\r\ndifferences are due no doubt to incorporation of other clans.\r\n\r\nThe subceramic area in which the Mesa Verde ruins lie embraces the\r\nvalleys of the San Juan and its tributaries, Chelly canyon, Chaco\r\ncanyon, and probably the ruins along the Rio Grande, on both sides\r\nof the river. Whether the Chaco or the Mesa Verde region is the\r\ngeographical center of this subarea, or not, can not be determined,\r\nbut the indications are that the Mesa Verde is on its northern\r\nborder. Along the southwestern and western borders the culture of\r\nthis area mingles with that of the subcultural area adjoining on the\r\nsouth, the resultant symbolism being consequently more complex. The\r\nceramic ware of ruins of the Mesa Verde is little affected by outside\r\nand diverse influences, while, on the contrary, similar ware found\r\nalong the western and southern borders of the subcultural area has\r\nbeen much modified by the influence of the neighboring region.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE COLORADO AREA\r\n\r\nAlthough the decoration on pottery from Spruce-tree House embraces\r\nsome symbols in common with that of the ruins along the Little\r\nColorado, including prehistoric Zuñi, there is evidence of a mingling\r\nof the two ceramic types which is believed to have originated in\r\nthe Gila basin. The resemblance in the pottery of these regions\r\nis greater near the sources of the Little Colorado, differences\r\nincreasing as one descends the river. At Homolobi (near Winslow) and\r\nChevlon, where the pottery is half northern and half southern in\r\ntype, these differences have almost disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis is what might be expected theoretically, and is in accordance\r\nwith legends of the Hopi, for the Little Colorado ruins are more\r\nmodern than the round-kiva culture of Chaco canyon and Mesa Verde,\r\nand than the square-ceremonial-house culture of the Gila. The\r\nindications are that symbolism of the Little Colorado ruins is a\r\ncomposite, representative in about equal proportions of the two\r\nsubcultures of the Southwest.[28]\r\n\r\nAs confirmatory of this suggested dual origin we find that the\r\nsymbolism of pottery from ruins near the source of the Little\r\nColorado is identical with that of the Salt, the Verde, and the\r\nTonto basins, from which their inhabitants originally came in larger\r\nnumbers than from the Rio Grande. In the ruins of the upper Salt\r\nand Gila the pottery is more like that of the neighboring sources\r\nof the Little Colorado because of interchanges. On the other hand,\r\nthe ancient Hopi, being more isolated than other Pueblos, especially\r\nthose on the Little Colorado, developed a ceramic art peculiar to\r\nthemselves. Their pottery is different from that of the Little\r\nColorado, the upper Gila and its tributary, the Salt, and the San\r\nJuan including the Mesa Verde.\r\n\r\nThe Zuñi valley, lying practically in the pathway of culture\r\nmigration or about midway between the northern and southern\r\nsubceramic areas, had no distinctive ancient pottery. Its ancient\r\npottery is not greatly unlike that of Homolobi near Winslow but has\r\nbeen influenced about equally by the northern and the southern type.\r\nWhatever originality in culture symbols developed in the Zuñi valley\r\nwas immediately merged with others and spread over a large area.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nMESA VERDE AREA\r\n\r\nWhile there are several subdivisions in the eastern subcultural area,\r\nthat in which the Mesa Verde ruins are situated is distinctive. The\r\narea embraces the ruins in the Montezuma valley and those of Chelly\r\ncanyon, and the San Juan ruins as far as Navaho mountain, including\r\nalso the Chaco and the Canyon Largo ruins. Probably the pottery of\r\nsome of the ruins east of the Rio Grande will be found to belong\r\nto the same type. That of the Hopi ceramic area, the so-called\r\n“Tusayan,” exclusive of Chelly canyon, is distinct from all others.\r\nThe pottery of the Gila subculture area is likewise distinctive but\r\nits influence made its way up the Verde and the Tonto and was potent\r\nacross the mountains, in the Little Colorado basin. Its influence is\r\nlikewise strong in the White Mountain ruins and on the Tularosa, and\r\naround the sources of the Gila and Salt rivers.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the decoration of pottery from Spruce-tree House\r\nfails to reveal a single specimen with the well-known broken\r\nencircling line called “the line of life.” As this feature is\r\nabsent from pottery from all the Mesa Verde ruins it may be said\r\nprovisionally that the ancient potters of this region were unfamiliar\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThis apparently insignificant characteristic is present, however,\r\nin all the pottery directly influenced by the culture of the\r\nsouthwestern subceramic area. It occurs in pottery from the Gila\r\nand the Salt River ruins, in the Hopi area, and along the Little\r\nColorado, including the Zuñi valley, and elsewhere. Until recorded\r\nfrom the northeastern subceramic area, “the line of life” may be\r\nconsidered a peculiarity of ceramics of the Gila subarea or of the\r\npottery influenced by its culture.\r\n\r\nAmong the restored food bowls from Spruce-tree House, having\r\ncharacteristic symbols, may be mentioned that represented in plate\r\n16, _d_, _d′_, which has on the interior surface a triangular design\r\nwith curved appendages to each angle. The triangular arrangement of\r\ndesigns on the interior surface of food bowls is not uncommon in the\r\nMesa Verde pottery.\r\n\r\nAnother food bowl has two unusual designs on the interior surface, as\r\nshown in plate 18, _c_, _c′_. The meaning of this rare symbolism is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nIn plates 16-19 are represented some of the most characteristic\r\nsymbols on the restored pottery.\r\n\r\nThe outer surfaces of many food bowls are elaborately decorated with\r\ndesigns as shown, while the rims in most cases are dotted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE IMPLEMENTS\r\n\r\nStone implements from Spruce-tree House include axes, mauls, stone\r\nhammers, and grinding stones, in addition to other objects of unknown\r\nuses. As a rule these stone implements are rudely made, although\r\nsome of them are as fine as any known from the Southwest. It is but\r\nnatural that these implements should have been manufactured from more\r\ncompact and harder rock than that of which the walls of the buildings\r\nwere constructed. Apparently these objects were not picked up in\r\nthe neighborhood but brought to the site of the ruin from a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAXES\r\n\r\nThe author collected several stone axes (pl. 21 and fig. 11) from\r\nSpruce-tree House, some of which (_a_-_f_) are fine specimens. These\r\nare all of the same general type, sharpened at one end and blunt at\r\nthe opposite end, with a groove midway for attachment of the handle.\r\nIn no case is there a ridge bordering this groove which in one\r\nspecimen (pl. 21, _g_) is partially duplicated.\r\n\r\nOne ax has a cutting edge at each end, while another (fig. 12) has\r\nthe handle still attached, recalling the two specimens figured by\r\nNordenskiöld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Stone axes.]\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of stone taken from Spruce-tree House are several\r\nsimilar to those called by the Hopi _tcamahias_ (pl. 21, _h_).\r\nThese implements are as a rule long, with smooth surfaces; they are\r\nsharpened at one end and pointed at the opposite end. Generally they\r\nhave no groove for the attachment of a handle; in one instance,\r\nhowever, there is an indentation on opposite borders. The use\r\nof these objects is unknown; they may have been axes or planting\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nStone objects of precisely the same type are highly prized by the\r\nHopi and play important parts in their ceremonials. A number of these\r\nobjects are arranged about the sand picture of the Antelope altar in\r\nthe Snake dance at Walpi.[30]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Stone ax with handle.]\r\n\r\nSimilar specimens are attached by the Hopi to their most sacred\r\npalladium, called the _tiponi_, or badge of office of the chief of\r\na priesthood. The tiponi of the Antelope society has one of these\r\nprojecting from its top. The meaning of this association may be even\r\ngreater than at first would be suspected, for according to legends\r\nthe Snake family, which is the guardian of the fetishes used in the\r\nsnake ceremonies, originally lived at Tokonabi, near Navaho mountain,\r\nat the mouth of the San Juan river. The culture of the ancient\r\ninhabitants of the ruins at that place was not very different from\r\nthat of the people of the Mesa Verde.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRINDING STONES\r\n\r\nBoth pestles and hand stones used in grinding maize were excavated,\r\nthe latter in considerable numbers. There were found also many\r\nstone slabs having rounded depressions, or pits, on opposite sides,\r\nevidently similar to those now used by the Hopi in grinding the\r\npaints for their ceremonials. In some places peckings or grooves in\r\nthe surfaces of the rocks show where these grinding stones were used,\r\nand perhaps flattened to the desired plane. These grinding places are\r\nfound in the plazas, on the sides of the cave back of the village,\r\nand elsewhere. A number of these grooves in a lower ledge of rock at\r\nthe spring indicate that this was a favorite spot for shaping the\r\nhand grinders, possibly for grinding corn or other seeds.\r\n\r\nThe hand stones are of several types: (1) Polygonal, having corners\r\nsomewhat worn, but flat on both sides, and having grooves on opposite\r\nedges to insure a firm hold for the hand; (2) convex on one face and\r\nflat on the opposite; (3) having two faces on each side, separated by\r\na sharp ridge. The third type represents apparently the last stage in\r\nthe life of a grinding stone the surfaces of which have been worn to\r\nthis shape by constant use.\r\n\r\nSeveral flat stones, each having a slight depression on one side,\r\nwere found to be covered with pigments of various colors, which were\r\nground on their surfaces by means of conical stones, as shown in\r\nfigure 13. Two rectangular flat stones (pl. 21, _i_, _j_) with finely\r\npolished surfaces and rounded edges have a notch on the rim. Their\r\nuse is unknown. Nordenskiöld refers to similar stones as “moccasin\r\nlasts,” but there seems no valid reason thus to identify these\r\nobjects except that they have the general form—although larger—of\r\nthe sole of the foot. The Spruce-tree House aborigines wore sandals\r\nand had no need for lasts. Moreover, so far as known, the Pueblo\r\nIndians never made use of an object of this kind in fashioning their\r\nmoccasins.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUNDING STONES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Stone pigment-grinder.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the excavations a large number of stones having pits\r\nin the sides were exhumed, but these are so heavy that they were not\r\nsent to Washington. Several of these stones are cubical in form and\r\nhave lateral pits, one on each of four faces. Some are thick, while\r\nothers are thin and sharpened at the end like an ax. These stones\r\nare probably the mauls with which the masons dressed the rocks used\r\nin the construction of the buildings. With such mauls the surfaces\r\nof the floors of some ceremonial rooms were cut down several inches\r\nbelow the original level. Some of the pounding stones resemble in\r\na measure the grinding stones, but in them pits replace grooves\r\ncommonly found in the edge of the latter.\r\n\r\nCorn was usually ground on flat stones called _metates_ which were\r\nfound in considerable numbers. These metates commonly show wear on\r\none or both surfaces, and a few specimens have a ridge on each border\r\nresulting from the wearing down of the middle of the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYLINDER OF POLISHED HEMATITE\r\n\r\nAmong the objects from the ruins of Mesa Verde figured by\r\nNordenskiöld is one designated a “cylinder of polished hematite,\r\nperhaps a fetish.” Another stone cylinder closely resembling this was\r\nfound by the present author at Spruce-tree House. This object closely\r\nresembles a bead, but as the author has seen similar stones used on\r\nHopi altars, especially on the altar to the cardinal points, he is\r\ninclined to accept the identification suggested by Nordenskiöld. On\r\naltars to the cardinal points small stones of different shapes and\r\ncolors are arranged near ears of corn surrounding a medicine bowl.\r\nAs black is the symbolic color of the underworld, a stone of this\r\ncolor is found on the black ear of corn representing the nadir. If\r\nthis cylinder is a fetish it may have been somewhat similarly used.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASKETRY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Fragment of basket.]\r\n\r\nNot a single entire basket was found, although a few fragments of\r\nbaskets made of woven rushes or osiers were obtained (fig. 14). It\r\nwould appear, however, from a fine basket figured by Nordenskiöld,\r\nwhich he ascribes to Spruce-tree House and from other known\r\nspecimens, figured and unfigured, that the Mesa Verde people were\r\nskillful basket makers. None of the fragments obtained by the author,\r\nand the same holds true regarding the basket figured by Nordenskiöld,\r\nare decorated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODEN OBJECTS\r\n\r\nFew objects made of wood were obtained at Spruce-tree House, but\r\nthose which were found are well made and reveal the existence of\r\ninteresting aboriginal customs. Wooden objects closely resembling\r\nsome of these were used until a few years ago by the Hopi and other\r\nPueblo tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTICKS TIED TOGETHER\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Sticks tied together.]\r\n\r\nAmong the wooden objects found are many perforated sticks tied\r\ntogether by strings. This specimen (fig. 15) is not complete, but\r\nenough remains to show that it is not unlike the covering in which\r\nthe Hopi bride rolls her wedding blankets. From the place where\r\nthe object was found, it appears that the dead were wrapped in\r\ncoverings of this kind. Although the specimen is much damaged, it is\r\nnot difficult to make out from the remaining fragment the mode of\r\nconstruction of the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLABS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Wooden slab.]\r\n\r\nNordenskiöld figures a wooden object of rectangular shape, slightly\r\nconcave on one side and more or less worn on the edges. Two similar\r\nwooden slabs (fig. 16) were found at Spruce-tree House. The objects\r\noccasioned much speculation, as their meaning is unknown. It has been\r\nsuggested they are cradle-boards, a conjecture which, in view of the\r\nfact that similar specimens are sometimes found in child burials, is\r\nplausible. In this interpretation the holes which occur on the sides\r\nmay have served for attachment of blankets or hoops. These boards, it\r\nmay be said, are small even for the most diminutive Indian baby.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion not without merit is that these boards are\r\npriest’s badges and were once carried in the hands suspended by\r\nstrings tied to the holes in their edges.\r\n\r\nStill another theory identifies them as parts of head dresses called\r\ntablets, worn in what the Pueblos call a _tablita_ dance.\r\n\r\nThe upright portions of some of the Hopi altars have similar wooden\r\nslabs painted with symbolic figures and tied together. Altars having\r\nslabs of the same description are used in ceremonials of certain\r\nTewan clans living in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINDLES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Spindle and whorl.]\r\n\r\nThere were found at Spruce-tree House a complete spindle with stick\r\nand whorl (fig. 17), and a whorl without the spindle, both of which\r\nare practically identical in type with the spinning apparatus of\r\nthe Hopi Indians. When in use this spindle was made to revolve by\r\nrubbing it on the thigh with one hand, while the other held the\r\nunspun cotton, the fiber being wound on one end of the spindle. This\r\nimplement affords still another indication that the arts of the\r\npeople of Spruce-tree House were similar to those still practised by\r\nthe Pueblos.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING-STICKS\r\n\r\nA few sticks which resemble those used by the Hopi as dibbles were\r\ncollected at Spruce-tree House. These measure several feet in length;\r\nthey are flat at one end, while the opposite end is pointed and\r\nrubbed down to a sharp edge. Some of these implements were slightly\r\nbent at one extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Ceremonial sticks.]\r\n\r\nAmong various wooden objects found at Spruce-tree House may be\r\nmentioned sticks resembling prayer offerings and others which may\r\nhave been employed in ceremonials (fig. 18.)\r\n\r\nA fragment of a primitive fire-stick (fig. 19) was obtained from\r\nthe northern refuse-heap and near it were straight sticks that\r\nundoubtedly served as fire-drills. There were one or two needles\r\n(fig. 20), made of hard wood, suggesting weaving or some similar\r\nprocess. A fragment of an arrow was unearthed in the débris of the\r\nnorthern refuse-heap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Primitive fire-stick.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Wooden needle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFABRICS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Belt.]\r\n\r\nThe yucca plant, which grows wild in the canyons and level places of\r\nthe Mesa Verde, furnishes a tough fiber which the prehistoric people\r\nof Spruce-tree House used in the manufacture of various fabrics.\r\nSmall packages of this fiber and cords made of the same material were\r\nfound in the refuse-heap and in the houses; these were apparently\r\nobtained by heating and chewing the leaves, after which the fiber was\r\ndrawn out into cords or braided into strings.\r\n\r\nA braided cord was also found attached to the handles of jars, and\r\nthis fiber was a favorite one in mending pottery. It was almost\r\nuniversally employed in weaving cloth netting and other fabrics,\r\nwhere it was combined with cotton fiber. Belts (fig. 21) or headbands\r\n(figs. 22, 23) show the best examples of this weaving. Native cotton\r\nfiber is not as common as yucca, being more difficult apparently to\r\nprocure. There is some doubt regarding the cultivation of the cotton\r\nplant, and no cotton seeds were identified; the cloth woven from this\r\nfiber shows great skill in weaving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Headband.]\r\n\r\nThe bark of willows and alders was utilized for fabrics, but this\r\nfurnished material for basketry rather than for cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. End of headband. FIG. 24. Head ring.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful specimens of woven cloth yet obtained in\r\nthe Mesa Verde ruins was taken from room 11; this is apparently a\r\nheadband for carrying bundles.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects obtained in the northern refuse-heap were rings\r\nmade of the leaf and fiber of yucca and other plants, sometimes\r\nblackened as if by fire (fig. 24). These rings may have been used\r\nfor carrying jars on the head, although some are too large and flat\r\nfor that purpose. It has been suggested that the largest were used in\r\nsome game, but this theory lacks confirmation.\r\n\r\nSmall fragments of matting were found, but no complete specimen came\r\nto light. These fragments resemble those referred to by Nordenskiöld\r\nas “objects used in carpeting the floors.” It was customary\r\namong some of the sedentary Indians of the Southwest to sleep on\r\nrectangular mats, and in one building of compound B of Casa Grande\r\nimpressions of these mats were found on the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Yucca-fiber cloth with attached feathers.]\r\n\r\nFragments of cloth made of yucca fiber (fig. 25), in which feathers\r\nare woven, are abundant in the refuse-heaps of Spruce-tree House.\r\nThere were found also many strings in which feathers were woven (fig.\r\n26), but of these nothing but the midribs remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Woven cord.]\r\n\r\nThe object shown in figure 27 is made of agave fiber tied in a series\r\nof loops. Its use is unknown.\r\n\r\nSeveral sandals were excavated at Spruce-tree House, the majority\r\nfrom the refuse-heap in the rear of the dwellings. One of these\r\nspecimens, figure 28, is in good condition; it is evidently a\r\nmortuary object, being found near a skeleton. The other specimen\r\n(fig. 29) is fragmentary, consisting of a sole of a sandal with\r\nattached toe cords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Agave fiber tied in loops.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Woven moccasin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Fragment of sandal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Hair-brush.]\r\n\r\nSeveral specimens of slender yucca leaves bound in a bundle were\r\nfound. One of these (fig. 30) served as a hair-brush, or was used in\r\nstirring food. One brush made of finer material was collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE IMPLEMENTS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Bone implements.]\r\n\r\nA large collection of beautiful bone implements (see fig.\r\n31)—needles, awls, tubes, and dirks—rewarded the work at Spruce-tree\r\nHouse. Some of these show the effects of fire throughout their\r\nlength, while others are smoked only at one end. When unearthed, one\r\nof these dirks was still in the original sheath of cedar bark (fig.\r\n32).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Dirk and cedar-bark sheath.]\r\n\r\nMost of the needles, bodkins, and awls are made of bones of birds or\r\nsmall animals. These were apparently rubbed down and pointed on stone\r\nimplements or on the sides of the cliff, where grooves are often\r\nfound (fig. 33).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Bone implement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Bone scraper.]\r\n\r\nSeveral fine bone scrapers (figs. 34, 35) were dug out of the débris\r\ncovering the floors of the rooms. These are beveled to a sharp edge\r\nat one end, the trochanter of the bone serving as a handle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. Bone scraper.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFETISH\r\n\r\nOnly one fetish in the form of a human being was obtained at\r\nSpruce-tree House, this being found in the débris near the floor of\r\nkiva G. So far as the objects from Mesa Verde ruins have been figured\r\nor described, this is the first record of the finding of a fetish\r\nof human shape in any of these ruins. Moreover, such a fetish is a\r\nrarity in cliff-house ruins elsewhere in the Southwest, a fact which\r\nimparts to this specimen more than usual interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGNITE GORGET\r\n\r\nIn the author’s account of his excavations in ruins in the Little\r\nColorado valley there was figured a large fragment of a disk made\r\nof cannel coal or lignite. This disk is convex on one side and\r\nplain on the side opposite, the latter having an eyelet, or two\r\nholes for suspension. A lignite gorget, similar for the most part\r\nto the above-mentioned specimen, but differing therefrom in having\r\nthe eyelet in the convex instead of in the flat side, was found\r\nat Spruce-tree House. Probably both objects were formerly used as\r\nornaments, being suspended about the neck. No similar specimen has\r\nthus far been described from Mesa Verde ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN, BEANS, AND SQUASH SEEDS\r\n\r\nAll indications point to maize, or Indian corn, as the chief food\r\nplant of the prehistoric people of this cliff-dwelling. This is\r\nevident not only from the presence in the ruins of metates and\r\ngrinding stones, but also from the abundance of corn ears and other\r\nfragments discovered; corn husks and seed corn were especially\r\nplentiful in rooms and in the refuse-heaps. As in the case of the\r\nmodern Pueblos, the corn appears to have been of several colors,\r\nwhile the size of the cobs indicates that the ears were small with\r\nbut few rows of seeds. In addition to cobs, fragments of corn stalks,\r\nleaves, and even tassels were found in some of the rooms. Beans of\r\nthe brown variety, specimens of which were numerous in one room,\r\nwere the most esteemed. There were obtained also stalks and portions\r\nof gourds some of which are artificially perforated, as well as a\r\ngourd the rind of which is almost complete. Apparently these gourds\r\nwere used for ceremonial rattles and for drinking vessels. The form\r\nsuggests that of a Hopi netted gourd in which sacred water is brought\r\nfrom distant springs for use in the kivas, or ceremonial rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOP-AND-POLE GAME\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. Hoop used in hoop-and-pole game.]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the discovery of a small wooden hoop in one of the\r\nrooms that the prehistoric people of Spruce-tree House were familiar\r\nwith the hoop-and-pole game (fig. 36) so popular among several of our\r\naboriginal tribes. But whether or not the individual hoop obtained\r\nwas used in a secular game or a ceremony may be open to differences\r\nof opinion. The author is inclined to connect the specimen above\r\nreferred to with basket dances, one of which is called by the Hopi\r\nthe _Owakulti_.[31] In this dance the hoop is rolled on the ground\r\nand the players throw or attempt to throw darts through it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEATHER AND SKIN OBJECTS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. Portion of leather moccasin.]\r\n\r\nFragments of leather or dressed skin (fig. 37) were found in several\r\nof the rooms. These are apparently parts of moccasins or sandals,\r\nbut may have been pouches or similar objects. A strip of rawhide by\r\nmeans of which an ax was lashed to its handle was picked up in the\r\ndump, where also was a fragment of what may have been a leather pouch\r\nwith a thong of hide woven in one edge. If skins of animals were used\r\nfor clothing, as they probably were, but slight evidence of the fact\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF OBJECTS SHOWING EUROPEAN CULTURE\r\n\r\nIn the excavations which were necessary to clean out the rooms of\r\nSpruce-tree House no object of European make was discovered. There\r\nwas no sign of any metal, even copper being unrepresented; no object\r\ndiscovered shows traces of cutting by knives or other implements made\r\nof metal. Evidently European culture exerted no influence on the\r\naborigines of Spruce-tree House.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\nNear Spruce-tree House, as elsewhere on the Mesa Verde, are\r\nfound examples of those rock-etchings and other markings known\r\nas pictographs. Some of these represent human beings in various\r\nattitudes, and animals, as deer, mountain sheep, snakes, and other\r\nsubjects not yet determined. As seems to be true of the other\r\nrock-inscriptions just mentioned, some of those near Spruce-tree\r\nHouse are religious symbols, some are totems, while others are mere\r\nscribblings.\r\n\r\nThese pictographs are so rude that they give little idea of the\r\nartistic possibilities of their makers, while many are so worn that\r\neven the subjects intended to be depicted are doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe walls of some of the rooms in the Mesa Verde cliff-dwellings\r\nstill show figures painted while the rooms were inhabited. Among\r\nthese the favorite designs are of triangular form.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the secular rooms and kivas of Spruce-tree House were\r\nformerly covered with a thin wash of colored sand which was well\r\nadapted for paintings of symbolic or decorative character. The colors\r\n(yellow, red, and white), were evidently put on with the hands,\r\nimpressions of which can be found in several places. In some cases,\r\nas with the upper part of the wall painted white and the lower part\r\nred, the contrast brings out the colors very effectively. The walls\r\nof some of the rooms are blackened with smoke.\r\n\r\nAmong the designs used are the triangular figures on the upper margin\r\nof the dados and pedestals of kivas. Figures similar in form, but\r\nreversed, are made by the Hopi, who call them butterfly and raincloud\r\nsymbols.\r\n\r\n_Birds and quadrupeds._—Nordenskiöld (pp. 108-9) thus writes of one\r\nof the ancient paintings:\r\n\r\n  The first of them, fig. 77, is executed in a room at Sprucetree\r\n  House. Here too the lower part of the mural surface is dark red,\r\n  and triangular points of the same colour project over the yellow\r\n  plaster; above this lower part of the wall runs a row of red dots,\r\n  exactly as in the estufa at Ruin 9. To the left two figures are\r\n  painted, one of them evidently representing a bird, the other a\r\n  quadruped with large horns, probably a mountain sheep. [Elsewhere,\r\n  as quoted on p. 5, Nordenskiöld identifies these figures as “two\r\n  birds.”] The painting shown in fig. 78 is similar in style to the\r\n  two just described.\r\n\r\nIn this room the dado bears at intervals along its upper edge the\r\ntriangular figures already noticed, and rows of dots which appear\r\nto be a symbolic decoration, occurring likewise on pottery, as an\r\nexamination of the author’s collection makes evident.\r\n\r\n_Square figures._—On the eastern wall of the same room in which occur\r\nthe figures of a bird and a horned mammal there is a square figure on\r\nthe white surface of the upper wall. This figure is black in outline;\r\npart of the surface bears an angular meander similar to decorations\r\non some pieces of pottery. Similar designs, arranged in series\r\naccording to Mindeleff’s figures, form the decoration band of one of\r\nthe kivas in Chelly canyon.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this figure is unknown but its widespread\r\ndistribution, especially in that region of the Southwest\r\ncharacterized by circular kivas, adds considerable interest to its\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n_Terraced figure._—Covering almost the whole side of a wall north of\r\nkiva C and overlooking the plaza of which this room forms in part the\r\nnorthern wall, is a conspicuous figure painted white. If we regard\r\nthe building of which this is a side as formerly two stories high,\r\nthis painting would have been on the inside of a room, otherwise we\r\nhave the exceptional feature of a painting on an outer wall. The\r\npurpose of this painting is not clear to the author, but similar\r\nfigures, reversed, signify rain clouds. The figure recalls in form a\r\nrepresentation of a =T=-shaped doorway and appears to be a unique one\r\namong Mesa Verde ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding facts it is evident that the people who once\r\ninhabited Spruce-tree House were not highly developed in culture,\r\nalthough the buildings show an advanced order of architecture for\r\naborigines of North America. Architecturally the cliff-dwellings\r\nexcel pueblos of more recent construction.\r\n\r\nThe pottery is not inferior to that of other parts of the Southwest,\r\nbut has fewer symbols and is not as fine or varied in colors as that\r\nfrom Sikyatki or from Casas Grandes in Sonora. It is better than the\r\npottery from the Casa Grande and other compounds of the Gila and\r\nabout the same in texture and symbols as that from Chelly canyon and\r\nChaco canyon.\r\n\r\nThe remaining minor antiquities, as cloth, basketry, wood, and bone,\r\nare of the same general character as those found elsewhere in the\r\nSouthwest. Shell work is practically lacking; no objects made from\r\nmarine shells have been found.\r\n\r\nThe picture of culture drawn from what we know of the life at\r\nSpruce-tree House is practically the same as that of a pueblo like\r\nWalpi at the time of its discovery by whites, and until about\r\nfifty years ago. The people were farmers, timid, industrious, and\r\nsuperstitious. The women were skillful potters and made fine baskets.\r\nThe men made cloth of good quality and cultivated corn, beans, and\r\nmelons.\r\n\r\nIn the long winters the kivas served as the lounging places for the\r\nmen who were engaged in an almost constant round of ceremonies of\r\ndramatic character, which took the place of the pleasures of the\r\nchase. They never ventured far from home and rarely met strangers.\r\nThey had all those unsocial characteristics which an isolated life\r\nfosters.\r\n\r\nWhat language they spoke, and whether various Mesa Verde Houses\r\nhad the same language, at present no one can tell. The culture was\r\nselfcentered and apparently well developed. It is not known whether\r\nit originated in the Mesa Verde canyons or was completely evolved\r\nwhen it reached there.\r\n\r\nAlthough we know little about the culture of the prehistoric\r\ninhabitants of Mesa Verde, it does not follow that we can not find\r\nout more. There are many ruins awaiting exploration in this region\r\nand future work will reveal much which has been so long-hidden.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of outside tribes, or what may be called human\r\nenvironment, probably had much to do originally with the choice of\r\ncaves for houses, and the magnificent caverns of the Mesa Verde\r\nnaturally attracted men as favorable sites for their houses. The\r\nhabit of huddling together in a limited space, necessitated by a life\r\nin the cliffs, possibly developed the composite form which still\r\npersists in the pueblo form of architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANTELOPE MESA RUINS, pottery from, 35\r\n\r\n  ANTIQUITIES—\r\n    major—\r\n      ceremonial room other than kiva, 24\r\n      circular rooms other than kivas, 23\r\n      construction of walls, 9-10\r\n      kivas, 17-23\r\n      ledge-houses, 24-25\r\n      mortuary room, 24\r\n      plazas and courts, 8-9\r\n      refuse-heaps, 25\r\n      secular rooms, 10-17\r\n      stairways, 25\r\n    minor—\r\n      absence of objects showing European culture, 51\r\n      basketry, 42\r\n      bone implements, 48-49\r\n      corn, beans, and squash seeds, 50\r\n      fabrics, 44-47\r\n      fetish, 49\r\n      general discussion, 25-28\r\n      hoop-and-pole game, 50-51\r\n      leather and skin objects, 51\r\n      lignite gorget, 49-50\r\n      pictographs, 51-53\r\n      pottery, 28-38\r\n      stone implements, 38-42\r\n      summary, 53\r\n      wooden objects, 42-44\r\n\r\n  ARCH unknown to cliff-dwellers, 4\r\n\r\n  AWATOBI, pottery from, 35, 36\r\n\r\n  AXES, STONE, description of, 26, 38-40\r\n\r\n\r\n  BALCONIES, description of, 15\r\n\r\n  BALCONY HOUSE, features of, 15\r\n\r\n  BASKETRY, description of, 42, 53\r\n    baskets found in Spruce-tree House, 6, 26\r\n\r\n  “BEAN PLANTING,” a Hopi festival, 10\r\n\r\n  BIRDSALL, DR.

Morley, the third story is indicated by crosshatching, the second\r\nby parallel lines, while the first has no markings. (Pl. 1.)\r\n\r\n[9] See H. R. No. 3703, 58th Cong., 3d sess., 1905.—The Ruined Cliff\r\nDwellings in Ruin and Navajo Canyons, in the Mesa Verde, Colorado, by\r\nCoert Dubois.\r\n\r\n[10] See _American Anthropologist_, n. s., v. no. 2, 224-288, 1903.\r\n\r\n[11] In Hopi dwellings the author has often seen a provisional\r\n_sipapû_ used in household ceremonies.\r\n\r\n[12] The proportion of kivas to dwellings in any village is not\r\nalways the same in prehistoric pueblos, nor is there a fixed ratio in\r\nmodern pueblos. It would appear that there is some relation between\r\nthe number of kivas and the number of inhabitants, but what that\r\nrelation is, numerically, has never been discovered.\r\n\r\n[13] Nordenskiöld on the contrary seems to make the terraced rooms\r\none of the points of resemblance between the cliff-dwellings and the\r\ngreat ruins of the Chaco. He writes:\r\n\r\n“On comparison of the ruins in Chaco Cañon with the cliff-dwellings\r\nof Mancos, we find several points of resemblance. In both localities\r\nthe villages are fortified against attack, in the tract of Mancos\r\nby their site in inaccessible precipices, in Chaco Cañon by a high\r\nouter wall in which no doorways were constructed to afford entrance\r\nto an enemy. Behind this outer wall the rooms descended in terraces\r\ntowards the inner court. One side of this court was protected by a\r\nlower semicircular wall. In the details of the buildings we can find\r\nseveral features common to both. The roofs between the stories were\r\nconstructed in the same way. The doorways were built of about the\r\nsame dimensions. The rafters were often allowed to project beyond\r\nthe outer wall as a foundation for a sort of balcony (Balcony House,\r\nthe Pueblo Chettro Kettle). The estufa at Hungo Pavie with its six\r\nquadrangular pillars of stone is exactly similar to a Mesa Verde\r\nestufa (see p. 16). The pottery strewn in fragments everywhere in\r\nChaco Cañon resembles that found on the Mesa Verde. We are thus\r\nnot without grounds for assuming that it was the same people, at\r\ndifferent stages of its development, that inhabitated these two\r\nregions.”—The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[14] Ibid., p. 67.\r\n\r\n[15] _Bulletin 35 of the Bureau of American Ethnology_, Antiquities\r\nof the Upper Gila and Salt River Valleys in Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\n[16] In some cases the walls of the later rectangular rooms are built\r\nacross and above them, as in compound B in the Casa Grande group of\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n[17] An examination of the best of previous maps of Spruce-tree House\r\nshows only a dotted line to indicate the location of this kiva.\r\n\r\n[18] It has no doubt occurred to others, as to the author, that the\r\nnumber of Spruce-tree House kivas is a multiple of four, the number\r\nof horizontal cardinal points. Later it may be found that there is\r\nsome connection between them and world-quarter clan ownership, or it\r\nmay be that the agreement in numbers is purely a coincidence.\r\n\r\n[19] The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde, p. 63.\r\n\r\n[20] In clearing the kivas several fragments of human bones and\r\nskulls were found by the author. The horizontal passageways, called\r\nventilators, of four of the kivas furnished a single broken skull\r\neach, which had not been buried with care.\r\n\r\n[21] From the great amount of bird-lime and bones in these heaps it\r\nhas been supposed that turkeys were domesticated and kept in these\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n[22] See The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde, pls. XXVIII, XXIX: 7.\r\n\r\n[23] The text figures which appear in this paper were drawn from\r\nnature by Mrs. M. W. Gill, of Forest Glen, Md.\r\n\r\n[24] The author is greatly indebted to Mr. A. V. Kidder for aid in\r\nsorting and labeling the fragments of pottery. Without his assistance\r\nin the field it would have been impossible to repair many of these\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n[25] The classification into cavate houses, cliff-dwellings, and\r\npueblos is based on form.\r\n\r\n[26] The above classification coincides in some respects with that\r\nobtained by using the forms of ceremonial rooms as the basis.\r\n\r\n[27] Of 40 pieces of pottery called “Tusayan,” figured in Professor\r\nHolmes’ Pottery of the Pueblo Area (_Second Annual Report of the\r\nBureau of Ethnology_), all but three or possibly four came from\r\nChelly canyon and belong to the San Juan rather than to the Hopi\r\nware. Black-and-white pottery is very rare in collections of old Hopi\r\nware, but is most abundant in the cliff-houses of Chelly canyon and\r\nthe Mesa Verde ruins.\r\n\r\n[28] The pottery from ruins in the Little Colorado basin, from Wukoki\r\nat Black Falls to the Great Colorado, is more closely allied to that\r\nof the drainage of the San Juan and its tributaries.\r\n\r\n[29] There is of course very little ancient Zuñi ware in museums, but\r\nsuch as we have justifies the conclusion stated above.\r\n\r\n[30] Snake Ceremonials at Walpi, in _Journal of American Archæology\r\nand Ethnology_, IV, 1894.\r\n\r\n[31] See figure of Owakulti altar in the author’s account of the\r\nOwakulti. Mr. Stewart Culin thus comments on the “hoop-and-pole”\r\ngame among Pueblos: “Similar ceremonies or games were practised\r\nby the cliff-dwellers, as is attested by a number of objects from\r\nMancos canyon, Colorado, in the Free Museum of Science and Art of\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania.”—_Twenty-fourth Annual Report of the\r\nBureau of American Ethnology._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added,\r\n  when a predominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\n  The name ‘Spruce-tree’ (with a hyphen) is used consistently in the\r\n  etext, except in quotations of Nordenskiöld where his use of\r\n  ‘Sprucetree’ is retained.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg 3: ‘Gustav Nordenksiöld’ replaced by ‘Gustav Nordenskiöld’.\r\n  Pg 16: ‘underlie their messa’ replaced by ‘underlie their mesa’.\r\n  Footnote 7: ‘Nordenskjöld’ replaced by ‘Nordenskiöld’.",
