Dakyns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a\r\n     pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,\r\n     and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land\r\n     and property in Scillus, where he lived for many\r\n     years before having to move once more, to settle\r\n     in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.\r\n\r\n     The Polity of the Lacedaemonians talks about the\r\n     laws and institutions created by Lycurgus, which\r\n     train and develop Spartan citizens from birth to\r\n     old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREPARER'S NOTE\r\n\r\n  This was typed from Dakyns' series, \"The Works of Xenophon,\" a\r\n  four-volume set.

I repeat, I withhold my praise so\r\nfar; but, given the fact that this is the type agreed upon, I propose\r\nto show that they set about its preservation in the right way; and that\r\nthose other transactions in connection with it, which are looked upon as\r\nblunders by the rest of the Hellenic world, are the reverse.\r\n\r\n (1) See Grote, \"H. G.\" vi. p. 47 foll.; Thuc. i. 76, 77; viii. 48;\r\n    Boeckh, \"P. E. A.\" passim; Hartman, \"An. Xen. N.\" cap. viii.;\r\n    Roquette, \"Xen. Vit.\" S. 26; Newman, \"Pol. Arist.\" i. 538; and\r\n    \"Xenophontis qui fertur libellus de Republica Atheniensium,\" ed.\r\n    A. Kirchhoff (MDCCCLXXIV), whose text I have chiefly followed.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"I do not praise their choice of the (particular) type, in so\r\n    far as...\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I maintain, it is only just that the poorer classes\r\n(3) and the People of Athens should be better off than the men of birth\r\nand wealth, seeing that it is the people who man the fleet, (4) and put\r\nround the city her girdle of power. The steersman, (5) the boatswain,\r\nthe lieutenant, (6) the look-out-man at the prow, the shipright--these\r\nare the people who engird the city with power far rather than her heavy\r\ninfantry (7) and men of birth of quality. This being the case, it seems\r\nonly just that offices of state should be thrown open to every one both\r\nin the ballot (8) and the show of hands, and that the right of speech\r\nshould belong to any one who likes, without restriction. For, observe,\r\n(9) there are many of these offices which, according as they are in good\r\nor in bad hands, are a source of safety or of danger to the People, and\r\nin these the People prudently abstains from sharing; as, for instance,\r\nit does not think it incumbent on itself to share in the functions of\r\nthe general or of the commander of cavalry. (10) The sovereign People\r\nrecognises the fact that in forgoing the personal exercise of these\r\noffices, and leaving them to the control of the more powerful (11)\r\ncitizens, it secures the balance of advantage to itself. It is only\r\nthose departments of government which bring emolument (12) and assist\r\nthe private estate that the People cares to keep in its own hands.\r\n\r\n (3) Cf. \"Mem.\" I. ii. 58 foll.\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. \"ply the oar and propel the galleys.\"\r\n\r\n (5) See \"Econ.\" viii. 14; Pollux, i. 96; Arist. \"Knights,\" 543 foll.;\r\n    Plat. \"Laws,\" v. 707 A; Jowett, \"Plat.\" v. 278 foll.; Boeckh, \"P.\r\n    E.

It is these\r\npoor people, this common folk, this riff-raff, (13) whose prosperity,\r\ncombined with the growth of their numbers, enhances the democracy.\r\nWhereas, a shifting of fortune to the advantage of the wealthy and the\r\nbetter classes implies the establishment on the part of the commonalty\r\nof a strong power in opposition to itself. In fact, all the world over,\r\nthe cream of society is in opposition to the democracy. Naturally, since\r\nthe smallest amount of intemperance and injustice, together with the\r\nhighest scrupulousness in the pursuit of excellence, is to be found in\r\nthe ranks of the better class, while within the ranks of the People\r\nwill be found the greatest amount of ignorance, disorderliness,\r\nrascality--poverty acting as a stronger incentive to base conduct, not\r\nto speak of lack of education and ignorance, traceable to the lack of\r\nmeans which afflicts the average of mankind. (14)\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"these inferiors,\" \"these good-for-nothings.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"some of these folk.\" The passage is corrupt.\r\n\r\nThe objection may be raised that it was a mistake to allow the universal\r\nright of speech (15) and a seat in council. These should have been\r\nreserved for the cleverest, the flower of the community. But here,\r\nagain, it will be found that they are acting with wise deliberation in\r\ngranting to (16) even the baser sort the right of speech, for supposing\r\nonly the better people might speak, or sit in council, blessings would\r\nfall to the lot of those like themselves, but to the commonalty the\r\nreverse of blessings. Whereas now, any one who likes, any base fellow,\r\nmay get up and discover something to the advantage of himself and his\r\nequals. It may be retorted: \"And what sort of advantage either for\r\nhimself or for the People can such a fellow be expected to hit upon?\"\r\nThe answer to which is, that in their judgment the ignorance and\r\nbaseness of this fellow, together with his goodwill, are worth a great\r\ndeal more to them than your superior person's virtue and wisdom, coupled\r\nwith animosity. What it comes to, therefore, is that a state founded\r\nupon such institutions will not be the best state; (17) but, given a\r\ndemocracy, these are the right means to procure its preservation. The\r\nPeople, it must be borne in mind, does not demand that the city should\r\nbe well governed and itself a slave. It desires to be free and to be\r\nmaster. (18) As to bad legislation it does not concern itself about\r\nthat. (19) In fact, what you believe to be bad legislation is the very\r\nsource of the People's strength and freedom. But if you seek for good\r\nlegislation, in the first place you will see the cleverest members of\r\nthe community laying down the laws for the rest. And in the next place,\r\nthe better class will curb and chastise the lower orders; the\r\nbetter class will deliberate in behalf of the state, and not suffer\r\ncrack-brained fellows to sit in council, or to speak or vote in\r\nParliament. (20) No doubt; but under the weight of such blessings the\r\nPeople will in a very short time be reduced to slavery.\r\n\r\n (15) Lit. \"everybody to speak in turn.\"\r\n\r\n (16) Or, \"it is a counsel of perfection on their part to grant to,\"\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"the ideal state.\"\r\n\r\n (18) Or, \"and to govern and hold office.\"\r\n\r\n (19) Or, \"it will take the risk of that.\"\r\n\r\n (20) See Grote, \"H. G.\" v. p. 510 note.\r\n\r\nAnother point is the extraordinary amount of license (21) granted to\r\nslaves and resident aliens at Athens, where a blow is illegal, and a\r\nslave will not step aside to let you pass him in the street. I will\r\nexplain the reason of this peculiar custom. Supposing it were legal\r\nfor a slave to be beaten by a free citizen, or for a resident alien or\r\nfreedman to be beaten by a citizen, it would frequently happen that\r\nan Athenian might be mistaken for a slave or an alien and receive a\r\nbeating; since the Athenian People is no better clothed than the slave\r\nor alien, nor in personal appearance is there any superiority. Or if the\r\nfact itself that slaves in Athens are allowed to indulge in luxury, and\r\nindeed in some cases to live magnificently, be found astonishing, this\r\ntoo, it can be shown, is done of set purpose. Where you have a naval\r\npower (22) dependent upon wealth (23) we must perforce be slaves to our\r\nslaves, in order that we may get in our slave-rents, (24) and let\r\nthe real slave go free. Where you have wealthy slaves it ceases to be\r\nadvantageous that my slave should stand in awe of you. In Lacedaemon my\r\nslave stands in awe of you. (25) But if your slave is in awe of me there\r\nwill be a risk of his giving away his own moneys to avoid running a risk\r\nin his own person. It is for this reason then that we have established\r\nan equality between our slaves and free men; and again between our\r\nresident aliens and full citizens, (26) because the city stands in need\r\nof her resident aliens to meet the requirements of such a multiplicity\r\nof arts and for the purposes of her navy. That is, I repeat, the\r\njustification for the equality conferred upon our resident aliens.\r\n\r\n (21) See Aristot. \"Pol.\" v. 11 and vi. 4; Jowett, op. cit. vol. i. pp.\r\n    179, 196; Welldon, \"The Politics of Aristotle,\" pp. 394 323; Dem.\r\n    \"Phil.\" III. iii. 10; Plaut. \"Stich.\" III. i. 37.\r\n\r\n (22) See Diod. xi. 43.\r\n\r\n (23) Reading, {apo khrematon, anagke}, or (reading, {apo khrematon\r\n    anagke}) \"considerations of money force us to be slaves.\"\r\n\r\n (24) See Boeckh, \"P.

R.\r\n    Kennedy.\r\n\r\nCitizens devoting their time to gymnastics and to the cultivation of\r\nmusic are not to be found in Athens; (27) the sovereign People has\r\ndisestablished them, (28) not from any disbelief in the beauty and\r\nhonour of such training, but recognising the fact that these are things\r\nthe cultivation of which is beyond its power. On the same principle, in\r\nthe case of the coregia, (29) the gymnasiarchy, and the trierarchy, the\r\nfact is recognised that it is the rich man who trains the chorus, and\r\nthe People for whom the chorus is trained; it is the rich man who is\r\ntrierarch or gymnasiarch, and the People that profits by their labours.\r\n(30) In fact, what the People looks upon as its right is to pocket\r\nthe money. (31) To sing and run and dance and man the vessels is well\r\nenough, but only in order that the People may be the gainer, while the\r\nrich are made poorer. And so in the courts of justice, (32) justice is\r\nnot more an object of concern to the jurymen than what touches personal\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n (27) For {mousike} and {gumnastike}, see Becker's \"Charicles,\" Exc.\r\n    \"Education.\"\r\n\r\n (28) See \"Revenues,\" iv. 52; Arist. \"Frogs,\" 1069, {e xekenosen tas te\r\n    palaistras}, \"and the places of exercise vacant and bare.\"--Frere.\r\n\r\n (29) \"The duties of the choregia consisted in finding maintenance and\r\n    instruction for the chorus\" (in tragedy, usually of fifteen\r\n    persons) \"as long as they were in training; and in providing the\r\n    dresses and equipments for the performance.\"--Jebb, \"Theophr.\r\n    Char.\" xxv. 3.

A.\" II. xvi. p. 241.\r\n\r\n (32) For the system of judicature, the {dikasteria}, and the boards of\r\n    jurymen or judges, see Aristot. \"Constitution of Athens,\" ch.\r\n    lxiii.; \"Dict. of Antiq.\" s.v.\r\n\r\nTo speak next of the allies, and in reference to the point that\r\nemissaries (33) from Athens come out, and, according to common opinion,\r\ncalumniate and vent their hatred (34) upon the better sort of people,\r\nthis is done (35) on the principle that the ruler cannot help being\r\nhated by those whom he rules; but that if wealth and respectability are\r\nto wield power in the subject cities the empire of the Athenian People\r\nhas but a short lease of existence. This explains why the better people\r\nare punished with infamy, (36) robbed of their money, driven from their\r\nhomes, and put to death, while the baser sort are promoted to honour. On\r\nthe other hand, the better Athenians throw their aegis over the better\r\nclass in the allied cities. (37) And why? Because they recognise that it\r\nis to the interest of their own class at all times to protect the best\r\nelement in the cities. It may be urged (38) that if it comes to strength\r\nand power the real strength of Athens lies in the capacity of her allies\r\nto contribute their money quota. But to the democratic mind (39) it\r\nappears a higher advantage still for the individual Athenian to get hold\r\nof the wealth of the allies, leaving them only enough to live upon\r\nand to cultivate their estates, but powerless to harbour treacherous\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n (33) For {oi ekpleontes}, see Grote, \"H. G.\" vi. p. 41.\r\n\r\n (34) Reading {misousi}; or, if with Kirchhoff, {meiousi}, \"in every\r\n    way humiliate.\"\r\n\r\n (35) Or, \"(they do so) as recognising the fact.\"\r\n\r\n (36) {atimia} = the loss of civil rights, either total or partial. See\r\n    C. R. Kennedy, \"Select Speeches of Demosthenes,\" Note 13,\r\n    Disenfranchisement.\r\n\r\n (37) See Thuc. viii. 48.\r\n\r\n (38) See Grote, \"H. G.\" vi. 53.\r\n\r\n (39) Or, \"to a thorough democrat.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, (40) it is looked upon as a mistaken policy on the part of the\r\nAthenian democracy to compel her allies to voyage to Athens in order to\r\nhave their cases tried. (41) On the other hand, it is easy to reckon up\r\nwhat a number of advantages the Athenian People derive from the practice\r\nimpugned. In the first place, there is the steady receipt of salaries\r\nthroughout the year (42) derived from the court fees. (43) Next, it\r\nenables them to manage the affairs of the allied states while seated\r\nat home without the expense of naval expeditions. Thirdly, they thus\r\npreserve the partisans of the democracy, and ruin her opponents in the\r\nlaw courts. Whereas, supposing the several allied states tried their\r\ncases at home, being inspired by hostility to Athens, they would destroy\r\nthose of their own citizens whose friendship to the Athenian People was\r\nmost marked. But besides all this the democracy derives the following\r\nadvantages from hearing the cases of her allies in Athens. In the first\r\nplace, the one per cent (44) levied in Piraeus is increased to the\r\nprofit of the state; again, the owner of a lodging-house (45) does\r\nbetter, and so, too, the owner of a pair of beasts, or of slaves to\r\nbe let out on hire; (46) again, heralds and criers (47) are a class of\r\npeople who fare better owing to the sojourn of foreigners at Athens.\r\nFurther still, supposing the allies had not to resort to Athens for the\r\nhearing of cases, only the official representative of the imperial\r\nstate would be held in honour, such as the general, or trierarch, or\r\nambassador. Whereas now every single individual among the allies is\r\nforced to pay flattery to the People of Athens because he knows that he\r\nmust betake himself to Athens and win or lose (48) his case at the bar,\r\nnot of any stray set of judges, but of the sovereign People itself,\r\nsuch being the law and custom at Athens. He is compelled to behave as\r\na suppliant (49) in the courts of justice, and when some juryman comes\r\ninto court, to grasp his hand. For this reason, therefore, the allies\r\nfind themselves more and more in the position of slaves to the people of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n (40) Grote, \"H.

(51) A man who is perpetually voyaging\r\nis forced to handle the oar, he and his domestics alike, and to learn\r\nthe terms familiar in seamanship. Hence a stock of skilful mariners is\r\nproduced, bred upon a wide experience of voyaging and practice. They\r\nhave learnt their business, some in piloting a small craft, others a\r\nmerchant vessel, whilst others have been drafted off from these for\r\nservice on a ship-of-war. So that the majority of them are able to row\r\nthe moment they set foot on board a vessel, having been in a state of\r\npreliminary practice all their lives.\r\n\r\n (50) See \"Mem.\" II. viii. 1.\r\n\r\n (51) See \"Hell.\" VII. i. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs to the heavy infantry, an arm the deficiency of which at Athens is\r\nwell recognised, this is how the matter stands. They recognise the fact\r\nthat, in reference to the hostile power, they are themselves inferior,\r\nand must be, even if their heavy infantry were more numerous. (1) But\r\nrelatively to the allies, who bring in the tribute, their strength even\r\non land is enormous. And they are persuaded that their heavy infantry is\r\nsufficient for all purposes, provided they retain this superiority.\r\n(2) Apart from all else, to a certain extent fortune must be held\r\nresponsible for the actual condition. The subjects of a power which is\r\ndominant by land have it open to them to form contingents from several\r\nsmall states and to muster in force for battle. But with the subjects of\r\na naval power it is different. As far as they are groups of islanders it\r\nis impossible for their states to meet together for united action, for\r\nthe sea lies between them, and the dominant power is master of the sea.\r\nAnd even if it were possible for them to assemble in some single island\r\nunobserved, they would only do so to perish by famine. And as to the\r\nstates subject to Athens which are not islanders, but situated on the\r\ncontinent, the larger are held in check by need (3) and the small ones\r\nabsolutely by fear, since there is no state in existence which does not\r\ndepend upon imports and exports, and these she will forfeit if she does\r\nnot lend a willing ear to those who are masters by sea. In the next\r\nplace, a power dominant by sea can do certain things which a land power\r\nis debarred from doing; as for instance, ravage the territory of a\r\nsuperior, since it is always possible to coast along to some point,\r\nwhere either there is no hostile force to deal with or merely a small\r\nbody; and in case of an advance in force on the part of the enemy they\r\ncan take to their ships and sail away. Such a performance is attended\r\nwith less difficulty than that experienced by the relieving force on\r\nland. (4) Again, it is open to a power so dominating by sea to leave its\r\nown territory and sail off on as long a voyage as you please. Whereas\r\nthe land power cannot place more than a few days' journey between itself\r\nand its own territory, for marches are slow affairs; and it is not\r\npossible for an army on the march to have food supplies to last for any\r\ngreat length of time. Such an army must either march through friendly\r\nterritory or it must force a way by victory in battle. The voyager\r\nmeanwhile has it in his power to disembark at any point where he finds\r\nhimself in superior force, or, at the worst, to coast by until he\r\nreaches either a friendly district or an enemy too weak to resist.\r\nAgain, those diseases to which the fruits of the earth are liable as\r\nvisitations from heaven fall severely on a land power, but are scarcely\r\nfelt by the navel power, for such sicknesses do not visit the whole\r\nearth everywhere at once. So that the ruler of the sea can get in\r\nsupplies from a thriving district. And if one may descend to more\r\ntrifling particulars, it is to this same lordship of the sea that the\r\nAthenians owe the discovery, in the first place, of many of the luxuries\r\nof life through intercourse with other countries. So that the choice\r\nthings of Sicily and Italy, of Cyprus and Egypt and Lydia, of Pontus or\r\nPeloponnese, or wheresoever else it be, are all swept, as it were,\r\ninto one centre, and all owing, as I say, to their maritime empire. And\r\nagain, in process of listening to every form of speech, (5) they have\r\nselected this from one place and that from another--for themselves. So\r\nmuch so that while the rest of the Hellenes employ (6) each pretty much\r\ntheir own peculiar mode of speech, habit of life, and style of dress,\r\nthe Athenians have adopted a composite type, (7) to which all sections\r\nof Hellas, and the foreigner alike, have contributed.\r\n\r\n (1) Reading after Kirchhoff, {ettous ge... kan ei meizon en, ton\r\n    dia k.t.l.} See Thuc. i. 143; Isocr. \"de Pace,\" 169 A; Plut.\r\n    \"Them.\" 4 (Clough, i. 235).\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"they are superior to their allies.\"\r\n\r\n (3) Reading with Kirchhoff, {dia khreian... dia deos}.\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"the army marching along the seaboard to the rescue.\"\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"a variety of dialects.\"\r\n\r\n (6) Or, \"maintain somewhat more.\"\r\n\r\n (7) Or, \"have contracted a mixed style, bearing traces of Hellenic and\r\n    foreign influence alike.\" See Mahaffy, \"Hist. of Greek Lit.\" vol.\r\n    ii. ch. x. p. 257 (1st ed.); cf.

But it has hit upon a means of meeting the\r\ndifficulty. They sacrifice--that is, the whole state sacrifices--at the\r\npublic cost a large number of victims; but it is the People that keeps\r\nholiday and distributes the victims by lot amongst its members. Rich men\r\nhave in some cases private gymnasia and baths with dressing-rooms, (9)\r\nbut the People takes care to have built at the public cost (10) a number\r\nof palaestras, dressing-rooms, and bathing establishments for its own\r\nspecial use, and the mob gets the benefit of the majority of these,\r\nrather than the select few or the well-to-do.\r\n\r\n (8) Reading with Kirchhoff, {istasthai}.\r\n\r\n (9) See Jebb, \"Theophr. Char.\" vii. 18, p. 202.\r\n\r\n (10) Reading with Kirchhoff, {demosia}.\r\n\r\nAs to wealth, the Athenians are exceptionally placed with regard to\r\nHellenic and foreign communities alike, (11) in their ability to\r\nhold it. For, given that some state or other is rich in timber for\r\nshipbuilding, where is it to find a market (12) for the product except\r\nby persuading the ruler of the sea? Or, suppose the wealth of some state\r\nor other to consist of iron, or may be of bronze, (13) or of linen yarn,\r\nwhere will it find a market except by permission of the supreme maritime\r\npower? Yet these are the very things, you see, which I need for my\r\nships. Timber I must have from one, and from another iron, from a third\r\nbronze, from a fourth linen yarn, from a fifth wax, etc. Besides which\r\nthey will not suffer their antagonists in those parts (14) to carry\r\nthese products elsewhither, or they will cease to use the sea.\r\nAccordingly I, without one stroke of labour, extract from the land and\r\npossess all these good things, thanks to my supremacy on the sea; whilst\r\nnot a single other state possesses the two of them. Not timber, for\r\ninstance, and yarn together, the same city. But where yarn is abundant,\r\nthe soil will be light and devoid of timber. And in the same way bronze\r\nand iron will not be products of the same city. And so for the rest,\r\nnever two, or at best three, in one state, but one thing here and\r\nanother thing there. Moreover, above and beyond what has been said, the\r\ncoast-line of every mainland presents, either some jutting promontory,\r\nor adjacent island, or narrow strait of some sort, so that those who are\r\nmasters of the sea can come to moorings at one of these points and wreak\r\nvengeance (15) on the inhabitants of the mainland.\r\n\r\n (11) Or, \"they have a practical monopoly.\"\r\n\r\n (12) Or, \"how is it to dispose of the product?\"\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"coppert.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Reading {ekei}. For this corrupt passage see L. Dindorf, ad.\r\n    loc.; also Boeckh, \"P. E. A.\" I. ix. p. 55. Perhaps (as my friend\r\n    Mr. J. R. Mozley suggests) the simplest supposition is to suppose\r\n    that there is an ellipsis before {e ou khresontai te thalatte}:\r\n    thus, \"Besides which they will not suffer their antagonists to\r\n    transport goods to countries outside Attica; they must yield, or\r\n    they shall not have the use of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n (15) {lobasthai}. This \"poetical\" word comes to mean \"harry,\"\r\n    \"pillage,\" in the common dialect.\r\n\r\nThere is just one thing which the Athenians lack. Supposing that they\r\nwere the inhabitants of an island, (16) and were still, as now, rulers\r\nof the sea, they would have had it in their power to work whatever\r\nmischief they liked, and to suffer no evil in return (as long as they\r\nkept command of the sea), neither the ravaging of their territory nor\r\nthe expectation of an enemy's approach. Whereas at present the farming\r\nportion of the community and the wealthy landowners are ready (17) to\r\ncringe before the enemy overmuch, whilst the People, knowing full well\r\nthat, come what may, not one stock or stone of their property will\r\nsuffer, nothing will be cut down, nothing burnt, lives in freedom from\r\nalarm, without fawning at the enemy's approach. Besides this, there\r\nis another fear from which they would have been exempt in an island\r\nhome--the apprehension of the city being at any time betrayed by their\r\noligarchs (18) and the gates thrown open, and an enemy bursting suddenly\r\nin. How could incidents like these have taken place if an island had\r\nbeen their home? Again, had they inhabited an island there would have\r\nbeen no stirring of sedition against the people; whereas at present,\r\nin the event of faction, those who set it in foot base their hopes of\r\nsuccess on the introduction of an enemy by land. But a people inhabiting\r\nan island would be free from all anxiety on that score. Since, however,\r\nthey did not chance to inhabit an island from the first, what they now\r\ndo is this--they deposit their property in the islands, (19) trusting\r\nto their command of the sea, and they suffer the soil of Aticca to be\r\nravaged without a sigh. To expend pity on that, they know, would be to\r\ndeprive themselves of other blessings still more precious. (20)\r\n\r\n (16) See Thuc. i. 143. Pericles says: \"Reflect, if we were islanders,\r\n    who would be more invulnerable? Let us imagine that we are.\"\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"are the more ready to cringe.\" See, for the word\r\n    {uperkhontai}, \"Pol. Lac.\" viii. 2; Plat. \"Crit.\" 53 E;\r\n    Rutherford, \"New Phrynichus,\" p. 110.\r\n\r\n (18) Or, \"by the minority\"; or, \"by a handful of people.\"\r\n\r\n (19) As they did during the Peloponnesian war; and earlier still,\r\n    before the battle of Salamis, in the case of that one island.\r\n\r\n (20) Or, \"but mean the forfeiture of others.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, states oligarchically governed are forced to ratify their\r\nalliances and solemn oaths, and if they fail to abide by their\r\ncontracts, the offence, by whomsoever committed, (21) lies nominally at\r\nthe door of the oligarchs who entered upon the contract. But in the case\r\nof engagements entered into by a democracy it is open to the People to\r\nthrow the blame on the single individual who spoke in favour of some\r\nmeasure, or put it to the vote, and to maintain to the rest of the\r\nworld, \"I was not present, nor do I approve of the terms of the\r\nagreement.\" Inquiries are made in a full meeting of the People, and\r\nshould any of these things be disapproved of, it can at once discover\r\nten thousand excuses to avoid doing whatever they do not wish. And if\r\nany mischief should spring out of any resolutions which the People has\r\npassed in council, the People can readily shift the blame from its own\r\nshoulders. \"A handful of oligarchs (22) acting against the interests\r\nof the People have ruined us.\" But if any good result ensue, they, the\r\nPeople, at once take the credit of that to themselves.\r\n\r\n (21) Reading {uph otououn adikeitai onomati upo ton oligon}, which I\r\n    suggest as a less violent emendation of this corrupt passage than\r\n    any I have seen; or, reading with Sauppe, {uph otou adikei\r\n    anomeitai apo ton oligon}, \"the illegality lies at the door of.\"\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"a few insignificant fellows.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit it is not allowed to caricature on the comic stage\r\n(23) or otherwise libel the People, because (24) they do not care to\r\nhear themselves ill spoken of. But if any one has a desire to satirise\r\nhis neighbour he has full leave to do so. And this because they are well\r\naware that, as a general rule, this person caricatured (25) does not\r\nbelong to the People, or the masses. He is more likely to be some\r\nwealthy or well-born person, or man of means and influence. In fact,\r\nbut few poor people and of the popular stamp incur the comic lash, or if\r\nthey do they have brought it on themselves by excessive love of meddling\r\nor some covetous self-seeking at the expense of the People, so that no\r\nparticular annoyance is felt at seeing such folk satirised.\r\n\r\n (23) See Grote, \"H. G.\" viii. 446, especially p. 449, \"growth and\r\n    development of comedy at Athens\"; Curtius, \"H. G.\" iii. pp. 242,\r\n    243; Thirlwall, \"H. G.\" ch. xviii. vol. iii. p. 42.\r\n\r\n (24) Or, more lit. \"it would not do for the People to hear,\" etc.\r\n\r\n (25) Or, \"the butt of comedy.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, I venture to assert is, that the People of Athens has no\r\ndifficulty in recognising which of its citizens are of the better\r\nsort and which the opposite. (26) And so recognising those who are\r\nserviceable and advantageous (27) to itself, even though they be base,\r\nthe People loves them; but the good folk they are disposed rather to\r\nhate. This virtue of theirs, the People holds, is not engrained in their\r\nnature for any good to itself, but rather for its injury. In direct\r\nopposition to this, there are some persons who, being (28) born of the\r\nPeople, are yet by natural instinct not commoners. For my part I pardon\r\nthe People its own democracy, as, indeed, it is pardonable in any one to\r\ndo good to himself. (29) But the man who, not being himself one of the\r\nPeople, prefers to live in a state democratically governed rather than\r\nin an oligarchical state may be said to smooth his own path towards\r\niniquity. He knows that a bad man has a better chance of slipping\r\nthrough the fingers of justice in a democratic than in an oligarchical\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n (26) Or, \"and which are good for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n (27) Or,\"its own friends and supporters.\"\r\n\r\n (28) Reading {ontes} or (if {gnontes}), \"who, recognising the nature\r\n    of the People, have no popular leaning.\" Gutschmidt conj. {enioi\r\n    egguoi ontes}, i.e. Pericles.\r\n\r\n (29) On the principle that \"the knee is nearer than the shin-bone,\"\r\n    {gonu knemes}, or, as we say, \"charity begins at home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI repeat that my position concerning the polity of the Athenians is\r\nthis: the type (1) of polity is not to my taste, but given that a\r\ndemocratic form of government has been agreed upon, they do seem to me\r\nto go the right way to preserve the democracy by the adoption of the\r\nparticular type (2) which I have set forth.\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"manner.\"\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"manner.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are other objections brought, as I am aware, against the\r\nAthenians, by certain people, and to this effect. It not seldom happens,\r\nthey tell us, that a man is unable to transact a piece of business with\r\nthe senate or the People, even if he sit waiting a whole year. Now this\r\ndoes happen at Athens, and for no other reason save that, owing to the\r\nimmense mass of affairs they are unable to work off all the business on\r\nhand, and dismiss the applicants. And how in the world should they be\r\nable, considering in the first place, that they, the Athenians, have\r\nmore festivals (3) to celebrate than any other state throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of Hellas? (During these festivals, of course, the\r\ntransaction of any sort of affairs of state is still more out of the\r\nquestion.) (4) In the next place, only consider the number of cases they\r\nhave to decide--what with private suits and public causes and scrutinies\r\nof accounts, etc., more than the whole of the rest of mankind put\r\ntogether; while the senate has multifarious points to advise upon\r\nconcerning peace and war, (5) concerning ways and means, concerning the\r\nframing and passing of laws, (6) and concerning the thousand and one\r\nmatters affecting the state perpetually occurring, and endless\r\nquestions touching the allies; besides the receipt of the tribute, the\r\nsuperintendence of dockyards and temples, etc. Can, I ask again, any one\r\nfind it at all surprising that, with all these affairs on their hands,\r\nthey are unequal to doing business with all the world?\r\n\r\n (3) See Arist. \"Wasps,\" 661.\r\n\r\n (4) This sentence is perhaps a gloss.\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"about the war,\" {peri tou polemou}.\r\n\r\n (6) See Thirlwall, ch. xxxii. vol. iv. p. 221, note 3.\r\n\r\nBut some people tell us that if the applicant will only address himself\r\nto the senate or the People with a fee in his hand he will do a good\r\nstroke of business. And for my part I am free to confess to these\r\ngainsayers that a good many things may be done at Athens by dint of\r\nmoney; and I will add, that a good many more still might be done, if\r\nthe money flowed still more freely and from more pockets. One thing,\r\nhowever, I know full well, that as to transacting with every one of\r\nthese applicants all he wants, the state could not do it, not even if\r\nall the gold and silver in the world were the inducement offered.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the cases which have to be decided on. Some one fails\r\nto fit out a ship: judgement must be given. Another puts up a building\r\non a piece of public land: again judgement must be given. Or, to take\r\nanother class of cases: adjudication has to be made between the choragi\r\nfor the Dionysia, the Thargelia, the Panathenaea, year after year. ( (7)\r\nAnd again in behalf of the gymnasiarchs a similar adjudication for the\r\nPanathenaea, the Prometheia, and the Hephaestia, also year after year.)\r\nAlso as between the trierarchs, four hundred of whom are appointed each\r\nyear, of these, too, any who choose must have their cases adjudicated\r\non, year after year. But that is not all. There are various magistrates\r\nto examine and approve (8) and decide between; there are orphans (9)\r\nwhose status must be examined; and guardians of prisoners to appoint.\r\nThese, be it borne in mind, are all matters of yearly occurrence; while\r\nat intervals there are exemptions and abstentions from military service\r\n(10) which call for adjudication, or in connection with some other\r\nextraordinary misdemeanour, some case of outrage and violence of an\r\nexceptional character, or some charge of impiety. A whole string of\r\nothers I simply omit; I am content to have named the most important part\r\nwith the exception of the assessments of tribute which occur, as a rule,\r\nat intervals of five years.

(12) If so, will any one say which\r\nought, and which ought not, to be adjudicated on, there and then? If, on\r\nthe other hand, we are forced to admit that these are all fair cases for\r\nadjudication, it follows of necessity that they should be decided during\r\nthe twelve-month; since even now the boards of judges sitting right\r\nthrough the year are powerless to stay the tide of evildoing by reason\r\nof the multitude of the people.\r\n\r\n (12) Reading with Kirchhoff. Cf. for {oiesthai khre}, \"Hell.\" VI. iv.\r\n    23; \"Cyr.\" IV. ii. 28.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. (13) \"But,\" some one will say, \"try the cases you\r\ncertainly must, but lessen the number of the judges.\" But if so, it\r\nfollows of necessity that unless the number of courts themselves are\r\ndiminished in number there will only be a few judges sitting in each\r\ncourt, (14) with the further consequence that in dealing with so small\r\na body of judges it will be easier for a litigant to present an\r\ninvulnerable front (15) to the court, and to bribe (16) the whole body,\r\nto the great detriment of justice. (17)\r\n\r\n (13) See Grote, \"H. G.\" v. 514, 520; Machiavelli, \"Disc. s. Livio,\" i.\r\n    7.\r\n\r\n (14) Reading with Sauppe, {anagke toinun, ean me}  (for the vulgate\r\n    {ean men oliga k.t.l.}) {oliga poiontai dikasteria, oligoi en\r\n    ekasto esontai to dikasterio}.

(18) As\r\na matter of fact these festivals are twice as numerous as those of any\r\nother people. But I will reckon them as merely equal to those of the\r\nstate which has the fewest.\r\n\r\n (18) Lit. \"it is not possible to give judgment\"; or, \"for juries to\r\n    sit.\"\r\n\r\nThis being so, I maintain that it is not possible for business affairs\r\nat Athens to stand on any very different footing from the present,\r\nexcept to some slight extent, by adding here and deducting there.\r\nAny large modification is out of the question, short of damaging the\r\ndemocracy itself. No doubt many expedients might be discovered for\r\nimproving the constitution, but if the problem be to discover some\r\nadequate means of improving the constitution, while at the same time the\r\ndemocracy is to remain intact, I say it is not easy to do this, except,\r\nas I have just stated, to the extent of some trifling addition here or\r\ndeduction there.\r\n\r\nThere is another point in which it is sometimes felt that the Athenians\r\nare ill advised, in their adoption, namely, of the less respectable\r\nparty, in a state divided by faction. But if so, they do it advisedly.\r\nIf they chose the more respectable, they would be adopting those whose\r\nviews and interests differ from their own, for there is no state in\r\nwhich the best element is friendly to the people. It is the worst\r\nelement which in every state favours the democracy--on the principle\r\nthat like favours like. (19) It is simple enough then. The Athenians\r\nchoose what is most akin to themselves. Also on every occasion on which\r\nthey have attempted to side with the better classes, it has not fared\r\nwell with them, but within a short interval the democratic party has\r\nbeen enslaved, as for instance in Boeotia; (20) or, as when they chose\r\nthe aristocrats of the Milesians, and within a short time these revolted\r\nand cut the people to pieces; or, as when they chose the Lacedaemonians\r\nas against the Messenians, and within a short time the Lacedaemonians\r\nsubjugated the Messenians and went to war against Athens.\r\n\r\n (19) I.e. \"birds of a feather.\"\r\n\r\n (20) The references are perhaps (1) to the events of the year 447\r\n    B.C., see Thuc. i. 113; cf. Aristot. \"Pol.\" v. 3, 5; (2) to 440\r\n    B.C., Thuc. i. 115; Diod. xii. 27, 28; Plut. \"Pericl.\" c. 24; (3)\r\n    to those of 464 B.C., followed by 457 B.C., Thuc. i. 102; Plut.\r\n    \"Cimon,\" c. 16; and Thuc. i. 108.\r\n\r\nI seem to overhear a retort, \"No one, of course, is deprived of his\r\ncivil rights at Athens unjustly.\" My answer is, that there are some\r\nwho are unjustly deprived of their civil rights, though the cases are\r\ncertainly rare. But it will take more than a few to attack the democracy\r\nat Athens, since you may take it as an established fact, it is not the\r\nman who has lost his civil rights justly that takes the matter to heart,\r\nbut the victims, if any, of injustice. But how in the world can any one\r\nimagine that many are in a state of civil disability at Athens, where\r\nthe People and the holders of office are one and the same? It is from\r\niniquitous exercise of office, from iniquity exhibited either in speech\r\nor action, and the like circumstances, that citizens are punished with\r\ndeprivation of civil rights in Athens. Due reflection on these matters\r\nwill serve to dispel the notion that there is any danger at Athens from\r\npersons visited with disenfranchisement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITY OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI recall the astonishment with which I (1) first noted the unique\r\nposition (2) of Sparta amongst the states of Hellas, the relatively\r\nsparse population, (3) and at the same time the extraordinary power and\r\nprestige of the community. I was puzzled to account for the fact. It was\r\nonly when I came to consider the peculiar institutions of the Spartans\r\nthat my wonderment ceased. Or rather, it is transferred to the\r\nlegislator who gave them those laws, obedience to which has been the\r\nsecret of their prosperity. This legislator, Lycurgus, I must needs\r\nadmire, and hold him to have been one of the wisest of mankind.\r\nCertainly he was no servile imitator of other states. It was by a\r\nstroke of invention rather, and on a pattern much in opposition to the\r\ncommonly-accepted one, that he brought his fatherland to this pinnacle\r\nof prosperity.\r\n\r\n (1) See the opening words of the \"Cyrop.\" and of the \"Symp.\"\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"the phenomenal character.\" See Grote, \"H.

Throughout the\r\nrest of the world the young girl, who will one day become a mother (and\r\nI speak of those who may be held to be well brought up), is nurtured\r\non the plainest food attainable, with the scantiest addition of meat\r\nor other condiments; whilst as to wine they train them either to total\r\nabstinence or to take it highly diluted with water. And in imitation,\r\nas it were, of the handicraft type, since the majority of artificers are\r\nsedentary, (5) we, the rest of the Hellenes, are content that our girls\r\nshould sit quietly and work wools. That is all we demand of them. But\r\nhow are we to expect that women nurtured in this fashion should produce\r\na splendid offspring?\r\n\r\n (4) Cf. a fragment of Critias cited by Clement, \"Stromata,\" vi. p.\r\n    741, 6; Athen. x. 432, 433; see \"A Fragment of Xenophon\" (?), ap.\r\n    Stob. \"Flor.\" 88. 14, translated by J. Hookham Frere, \"Theognis\r\n    Restitutus,\" vol. i. 333; G. Sauppe, \"Append. de Frag. Xen.\" p.\r\n    293; probably by Antisthenes (Bergk. ii. 497).\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"such technical work is for the most part sedentary.\"\r\n\r\nLycurgus pursued a different path. Clothes were things, he held, the\r\nfurnishing of which might well enough be left to female slaves. And,\r\nbelieving that the highest function of a free woman was the bearing of\r\nchildren, in the first place he insisted on the training of the body\r\nas incumbent no less on the female than the male; and in pursuit of the\r\nsame idea instituted rival contests in running and feats of strength\r\nfor women as for men. His belief was that where both parents were strong\r\ntheir progeny would be found to be more vigorous.\r\n\r\nAnd so again after marriage. In view of the fact that immoderate\r\nintercourse is elsewhere permitted during the earlier period of\r\nmatrimony, he adopted a principle directly opposite. He laid it down\r\nas an ordinance that a man should be ashamed to be seen visiting the\r\nchamber of his wife, whether going in or coming out. When they did meet\r\nunder such restraint the mutual longing of these lovers could not but be\r\nincreased, and the fruit which might spring from such intercourse\r\nwould tend to be more robust than theirs whose affections are cloyed\r\nby satiety. By a farther step in the same direction he refused to allow\r\nmarriages to be contracted (6) at any period of life according to the\r\nfancy of the parties concerned. Marriage, as he ordained it, must only\r\ntake place in the prime of bodily vigour, (7) this too being, as he\r\nbelieved, a condition conducive to the production of healthy offspring.\r\nOr again, to meet the case which might occur of an old man (8) wedded to\r\na young wife. Considering the jealous watch which such husbands are apt\r\nto keep over their wives, he introduced a directly opposite custom; that\r\nis to say, he made it incumbent on the aged husband to introduce\r\nsome one whose qualities, physical and moral, he admired, to play the\r\nhusband's part and to beget him children. Or again, in the case of a\r\nman who might not desire to live with a wife permanently, but yet\r\nmight still be anxious to have children of his own worthy the name, the\r\nlawgiver laid down a law (9) in his behalf. Such a one might select\r\nsome woman, the wife of some man, well born herself and blest with fair\r\noffspring, and, the sanction and consent of her husband first obtained,\r\nraise up children for himself through her.\r\n\r\n (6) \"The bride to be wooed and won.\" The phrase {agesthai} perhaps\r\n    points to some primitive custom of capturing and carrying off the\r\n    bride, but it had probably become conventional.\r\n\r\n (7) Cf. Plut. \"Lycurg,\" 15 (Clough, i. 101). \"In their marriages the\r\n    husband carried off his bride by a sort of force; nor were their\r\n    brides ever small and of tender years, but in their full bloom and\r\n    ripeness.\"\r\n\r\n (8) Cf. Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 15 (Clough, i. 103).\r\n\r\n (9) Or, \"established a custom to suit the case.\"\r\n\r\nThese and many other adaptations of a like sort the lawgiver sanctioned.\r\nAs, for instance, at Sparta a wife will not object to bear the burden\r\nof a double establishment, (10) or a husband to adopt sons as\r\nfoster-brothers of his own children, with a full share in his family and\r\nposition, but possessing no claim to his wealth and property.\r\n\r\n (10) Cf. Plut. \"Comp. of Numa with Lycurgus,\" 4; \"Cato mi.\" 25\r\n    (Clough, i. 163; iv. 395).\r\n\r\nSo opposed to those of the rest of the world are the principles which\r\nLycurgus devised in reference to the production of children. Whether\r\nthey enabled him to provide Sparta with a race of men superior to all in\r\nsize and strength I leave to the judgment of whomsoever it may concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWith this exposition of the customs in connection with the birth of\r\nchildren, I wish now to explain the systems of education in fashion here\r\nand elsewhere. Throughout the rest of Hellas the custom on the part of\r\nthose who claim to educate their sons in the best way is as follows. As\r\nsoon as the children are of an age to understand what is said to them\r\nthey are immediately placed under the charge of Paidagogoi (1) (or\r\ntutors), who are also attendants, and sent off to the school of some\r\nteacher to be taught \"grammar,\" \"music,\" and the concerns of the\r\npalestra. (2) Besides this they are given shoes (3) to wear which tend\r\nto make their feet tender, and their bodies are enervated by various\r\nchanges of clothing. And as for food, the only measure recognised is\r\nthat which is fixed by appetite.\r\n\r\n (1) = \"boy-leaders.\" Cf. St. Paul, \"Ep. Gal.\" iii. 24; The Law was our\r\n    schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.\r\n\r\n (2) Cf. Plato, \"Alc. maj.\" 106 E; \"Theages,\" 122 E; Aristot. \"Pol.\"\r\n    viii. 3.\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"sandals.\"\r\n\r\nBut when we turn to Lycurgus, instead of leaving it to each member of\r\nthe state privately to appoint a slave to be his son's tutor, he\r\nset over the young Spartans a public guardian, the Paidonomos (4) or\r\n\"pastor,\" to give them his proper title, (5) with complete authority\r\nover them. This guardian was selected from those who filled the highest\r\nmagistracies. He had authority to hold musters of the boys, (6) and as\r\ntheir overseer, in case of any misbehaviour, to chastise severely. The\r\nlegislator further provided his pastor with a body of youths in the\r\nprime of life, and bearing whips, (7) to inflict punishment when\r\nnecessary, with this happy result that in Sparta modesty and obedience\r\never go hand in hand, nor is there lack of either.\r\n\r\n (4) = \"boyherd.\"\r\n\r\n (5) Cf. Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 17 (Clough, i. 107); Aristot. \"Pol.\" iv. 15,\r\n    13; vii. 17, 5.\r\n\r\n (6) Or, \"assemble the boys in flocks.\"\r\n\r\n (7) {mastigophoroi} = \"flagellants.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of softening their feet with shoe or sandal, his rule was to\r\nmake them hardy through going barefoot. (8) This habit, if practised,\r\nwould, as he believed, enable them to scale heights more easily and\r\nclamber down precipices with less danger. In fact, with his feet so\r\ntrained the young Spartan would leap and spring and run faster unshod\r\nthan another shod in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n (8) Cf. Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 16 (Clough, i. 106).\r\n\r\nInstead of making them effeminate with a variety of clothes, his rule\r\nwas to habituate them to a single garment the whole year through,\r\nthinking that so they would be better prepared to withstand the\r\nvariations of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nAgain, as regards food, according to his regulation the Eiren, (9) or\r\nhead of the flock, must see that his messmates gathered to the club\r\nmeal, (10) with such moderate food as to avoid that heaviness (11)\r\nwhich is engendered by repletion, and yet not to remain altogether\r\nunacquainted with the pains of penurious living. His belief was that by\r\nsuch training in boyhood they would be better able when occasion demanded\r\nto continue toiling on an empty stomach. They would be all the fitter,\r\nif the word of command were given, to remain on the stretch for a long\r\ntime without extra dieting. The craving for luxuries (12) would be\r\nless, the readiness to take any victual set before them greater, and,\r\nin general, the regime would be found more healthy. (13) Under it he\r\nthought the lads would increase in stature and shape into finer men,\r\nsince, as he maintained, a dietary which gave suppleness to the limbs\r\nmust be more conducive to both ends than one which added thickness to\r\nthe bodily parts by feeding. (14)\r\n\r\n (9) For the Eiren, see Plut. \"Lycurg.\" (Clough, i. 107).\r\n\r\n (10) Reading {sumboleuein} (for the vulg. {sumbouleuein}). The\r\n    emendation is now commonly adopted. For the word itself, see L.\r\n    Dindorf, n. ad loc., and Schneider. {sumbolon} = {eranos} or club\r\n    meal. Perhaps we ought to read {ekhontas} instead of {ekhonta}.\r\n\r\n (11) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 17 (Clough, i. 108).\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"condiments,\" such as \"meat,\" \"fish,\" etc. See \"Cyrop.\" I.\r\n    ii. 8.\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"and in general they would live more healthily and increase\r\n    in stature.\"\r\n\r\n (14) See L. Dindorf's emendation of this corrupt passage, n. ad loc.\r\n    (based upon Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 17 and Ps. Plut. \"Moral.\" 237), {kai\r\n    eis mekos d' an auxanesthai oeto kai eueidesterous} vel {kallious\r\n    gignesthai, pros amphotera ton radina ta somata poiousan trophen\r\n    mallon sullambanein egesamenos e ten diaplatunousan}. Otherwise I\r\n    would suggest to read {kai eis mekos an auxanesthai ten  (gar)\r\n    radina... egesato k.t.l.}, which is closer to the vulgate, and\r\n    gives nearly the same sense.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in order to guard against a too great pinch of\r\nstarvation, though he did not actually allow the boys to help themselves\r\nwithout further trouble to what they needed more, he did give them\r\npermission to steal (15) this thing or that in the effort to alleviate\r\ntheir hunger. It was not of course from any real difficulty how else to\r\nsupply them with nutriment that he left it to them to provide themselves\r\nby this crafty method. Nor can I conceive that any one will so\r\nmisinterpret the custom. Clearly its explanation lies in the fact that\r\nhe who would live the life of a robber must forgo sleep by night, and in\r\nthe daytime he must employ shifts and lie in ambuscade; he must\r\nprepare and make ready his scouts, and so forth, if he is to succeed in\r\ncapturing the quarry. (16)\r\n\r\n (15) See \"Anab.\" IV. vi. 14.\r\n\r\n (16) For the institution named the {krupteia}, see Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 28\r\n    (Clough, i. 120); Plato, \"Laws,\" i. 633 B; for the {klopeia}, ib.\r\n    vii. 823 E; Isocr. \"Panathen.\" 277 B.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, I say, that the whole of this education tended, and was\r\nintended, to make the boys craftier and more inventive in getting in\r\nsupplies, whilst at the same time it cultivated their warlike instincts.\r\nAn objector may retort: \"But if he thought it so fine a feat to steal,\r\nwhy did he inflict all those blows on the unfortunate who was caught?\"\r\nMy answer is: for the self-same reason which induces people, in other\r\nmatters which are taught, to punish the mal-performance of a service.\r\nSo they, the Lacedaemonians, visit penalties on the boy who is detected\r\nthieving as being but a sorry bungler in the art. So to steal as many\r\ncheeses as possible (off the shrine of Orthia (17)) was a feat to be\r\nencouraged; but, at the same moment, others were enjoined to scourge the\r\nthief, which would point a moral not obscurely, that by pain endured for\r\na brief season a man may earn the joyous reward of lasting glory. (18)\r\nHerein, too, it is plainly shown that where speed is requisite the\r\nsluggard will win for himself much trouble and scant good.\r\n\r\n (17) I.e. \"Artemis of the Steep\"--a title connecting the goddess with\r\n    Mount Orthion or Orthosion. See Pausan. VIII. xxiii. 1; and for\r\n    the custom, see Themistius, \"Or.\" 21, p. 250 A. The words have\r\n    perhaps got out of their right place. See Schneider's Index, s.v.\r\n\r\n (18) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 18; \"Morals,\" 239 C; \"Aristid.\" 17; Cic.\r\n    \"Tusc.\" ii. 14.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, and in order that the boys should not want a ruler, even\r\nin case the pastor (19) himself were absent, he gave to any citizen who\r\nchanced to be present authority to lay upon them injunctions for their\r\ngood, and to chastise them for any trespass committed. By so doing he\r\ncreated in the boys of Sparta a most rare modesty and reverence. And\r\nindeed there is nothing which, whether as boys or men, they respect more\r\nhighly than the ruler. Lastly, and with the same intention, that the\r\nboys must never be reft of a ruler, even if by chance there were no\r\ngrown man present, he laid down the rule that in such a case the most\r\nactive of the Leaders or Prefects (20) was to become ruler for the\r\nnonce, each of his own division. The conclusion being that under no\r\ncircumstances whatever are the boys of Sparta destitute of one to rule\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n (19) Lit. \"Paidonomos.\"\r\n\r\n (20) Lit. \"Eirens.\"\r\n\r\nI ought, as it seems to me, not to omit some remark on the subject of\r\nboy attachments, (21) it being a topic in close connection with that of\r\nboyhood and the training of boys.\r\n\r\n (21) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 17 (Clough, i. 109).\r\n\r\nWe know that the rest of the Hellenes deal with this relationship in\r\ndifferent ways, either after the manner of the Boeotians, (22) where man\r\nand boy are intimately united by a bond like that of wedlock, or after\r\nthe manner of the Eleians, where the fruition of beauty is an act of\r\ngrace; whilst there are others who would absolutely debar the lover from\r\nall conversation (23) and discourse with the beloved.\r\n\r\n (22) See Xen. \"Symp.\" viii. 34; Plato, \"Symp.\" 182 B (Jowett, II. p.\r\n    33).\r\n\r\n (23) {dialegesthai} came to mean philosophic discussion and debate. Is\r\n    the author thinking of Socrates? See \"Mem.\" I. ii. 35; IV. v. 12.\r\n\r\nLycurgus adopted a system opposed to all of these alike. Given that some\r\none, himself being all that a man ought to be, should in admiration of\r\na boy's soul (24) endeavour to discover in him a true friend without\r\nreproach, and to consort with him--this was a relationship which\r\nLycurgus commended, and indeed regarded as the noblest type of bringing\r\nup. But if, as was evident, it was not an attachment to the soul, but\r\na yearning merely towards the body, he stamped this thing as foul and\r\nhorrible; and with this result, to the credit of Lycurgus be it said,\r\nthat in Lacedaemon the relationship of lover and beloved is like that\r\nof parent and child or brother and brother where carnal appetite is in\r\nabeyance.\r\n\r\n (24) See Xen. \"Symp.\" viii. 35; Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 18.\r\n\r\nThat this, however, which is the fact, should be scarcely credited in\r\nsome quarters does not surprise me, seeing that in many states the laws\r\n(25) do not oppose the desires in question.\r\n\r\n (25) I.e. \"law and custom.\"\r\n\r\nI have now described the two chief methods of education in vogue; that\r\nis to say, the Lacedaemonian as contrasted with that of the rest of\r\nHellas, and I leave it to the judgment of him whom it may concern, which\r\nof the two has produced the finer type of men. And by finer I mean the\r\nbetter disciplined, the more modest and reverential, and, in matters\r\nwhere self-restraint is a virtue, the more continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nComing to the critical period at which a boy ceases to be a boy and\r\nbecomes a youth, (1) we find that it is just then that the rest of the\r\nworld proceed to emancipate their children from the private tutor and\r\nthe schoolmaster, and, without substituting any further ruler, are\r\ncontent to launch them into absolute independence.\r\n\r\n (1) {eis to meirakiousthai}, \"with reference to hobbledehoy-hood.\"\r\n    Cobet erases the phrase as post-Xenophontine.\r\n\r\nHere, again, Lycurgus took an entirely opposite view of the matter.\r\nThis, if observation might be trusted, was the season when the tide\r\nof animal spirits flows fast, and the froth of insolence rises to the\r\nsurface; when, too, the most violent appetites for divers pleasures, in\r\nserried ranks, invade (2) the mind. This, then, was the right moment at\r\nwhich to impose tenfold labours upon the growing youth, and to devise\r\nfor him a subtle system of absorbing occupation. And by a crowning\r\nenactment, which said that \"he who shrank from the duties imposed on\r\nhim would forfeit henceforth all claim to the glorious honours of the\r\nstate,\" he caused, not only the public authorities, but those personally\r\ninterested (3) in the several companies of youths to take serious\r\npains so that no single individual of them should by an act of craven\r\ncowardice find himself utterly rejected and reprobate within the body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"range themselves.\" For the idea, see \"Mem.\" I. ii. 23;\r\n    Swinburne, \"Songs before Sunrise\": Prelude, \"Past youth where\r\n    shoreward shallows are.\"\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"the friends and connections.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in his desire to implant in their youthful souls a root of\r\nmodesty he imposed upon these bigger boys a special rule. In the very\r\nstreets they were to keep their two hands (4) within the folds of the\r\ncloak; they were to walk in silence and without turning their heads to\r\ngaze, now here, now there, but rather to keep their eyes fixed upon the\r\nground before them. And hereby it would seem to be proved conclusively\r\nthat, even in the matter of quiet bearing and sobriety, (5) the\r\nmasculine type may claim greater strength than that which we attribute\r\nto the nature of women. At any rate, you might sooner expect a stone\r\nimage to find voice than one of those Spartan youths; to divert the eyes\r\nof some bronze stature were less difficult. And as to quiet bearing, no\r\nbride ever stepped in bridal bower (6) with more natural modesty. Note\r\nthem when they have reached the public table. (7) The plainest answer to\r\nthe question asked--that is all you need expect to hear from their lips.\r\n\r\n (4) See Cic. \"pro Coelio,\" 5.\r\n\r\n (5) See Plat. \"Charmid.\" 159 B; Jowett, \"Plato,\" I. 15.\r\n\r\n (6) Longinus, {peri ups}, iv. 4, reading {ophthalmois} for\r\n    {thalamois}, says: \"Yet why speak of Timaeus, when even men like\r\n    Xenophon and Plato, the very demigods of literature, though they\r\n    had sat at the feet of Socrates, sometimes forget themselves in\r\n    the pursuit of such pretty conceits? The former in his account of\r\n    the Spartan Polity has these words: 'Their voice you would no more\r\n    hear, than if they were of marble, their gaze is as immovable as\r\n    if they were cast in bronze. You would deem them more modest than\r\n    the very maidens in their eyes.' To speak of the pupils of the\r\n    eyes as modest maidens was a piece of absurdity becoming\r\n    Amphicrates rather than Xenophon; and then what a strange notion\r\n    to suppose that modesty is always without exception, expressed in\r\n    the eye!\"--H. L. Howell, \"Longinus,\" p. 8. See \"Spectator,\" No.\r\n    354.\r\n\r\n (7) See Paus. VII. i. 8, the {phidition} or {philition}; \"Hell.\" V.\r\n    iv. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBut if he was thus careful in the education of the stripling, (1) the\r\nSpartan lawgiver showed a still greater anxiety in dealing with those\r\nwho had reached the prime of opening manhood; considering their immense\r\nimportance to the city in the scale of good, if only they proved\r\nthemselves the men they should be. He had only to look around to see\r\nwhat wherever the spirit of emulation (2) is most deeply seated, there,\r\ntoo, their choruses and gymnastic contests will present alike a far\r\nhigher charm to eye and ear. And on the same principle he persuaded\r\nhimself that he needed only to confront (3) his youthful warriors in\r\nthe strife of valour, and with like result. They also, in their degree,\r\nmight be expected to attain to some unknown height of manly virtue.\r\n\r\n (1) See \"Hell.\" V. iv. 32.\r\n\r\n (2) Cf. \"Cyrop.\" II. i. 22.\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"pit face to face.\"\r\n\r\nWhat method he adopted to engage these combatants I will now explain. It\r\nis on this wise. Their ephors select three men out of the whole body of\r\nthe citizens in the prime of life. These three are named Hippagretai,\r\nor masters of the horse. Each of these selects one hundred others,\r\nbeing bound to explain for what reason he prefers in honour these and\r\ndisapproves of those. The result is that those who fail to obtain the\r\ndistinction are now at open war, not only with those who rejected them,\r\nbut with those who were chosen in their stead; and they keep ever a\r\njealous eye on one another to detect some slip of conduct contrary to\r\nthe high code of honour there held customary. And so is set on foot that\r\nstrife, in truest sense acceptable to heaven, and for the purposes of\r\nstate most politic. It is a strife in which not only is the pattern of a\r\nbrave man's conduct fully set forth, but where, too, each against other\r\nand in separate camps, the rival parties train for victory. One day the\r\nsuperiority shall be theirs; or, in the day of need, one and all to\r\nthe last man, they will be ready to aid the fatherland with all their\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nNecessity, moreover, is laid upon them to study a good habit of the\r\nbody, coming as they do to blows with their fists for very strife's sake\r\nwhenever they meet. Albeit, any one present has a right to separate the\r\ncombatants, and, if obedience is not shown to the peacemaker, the Pastor\r\nof youth (4) hales the delinquent before the ephors, and the ephors\r\ninflict heavy damages, since they will have it plainly understood that\r\nrage must never override obedience to law.\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. \"the Paidonomos.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to those who have already passed (5) the vigour of early\r\nmanhood, and on whom the highest magistracies henceforth devolve, there\r\nis a like contrast. In Hellas generally we find that at this age the\r\nneed of further attention to physical strength is removed, although the\r\nimposition of military service continues. But Lycurgus made it customary\r\nfor that section of his citizens to regard hunting as the highest honour\r\nsuited to their age; albeit, not to the exclusion of any public duty.\r\n(6) And his aim was that they might be equally able to undergo the\r\nfatigues of war with those in the prime of early manhood.\r\n\r\n (5) Probably the {agathoergoi}, technically so called. See Herod. i.\r\n    67; Schneider, ap. Dindorf.\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"save only if some public duty intervened.\" See \"Cyrop.\" I.\r\n    ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe above is a fairly exhaustive statement of the institutions traceable\r\nto the legislation of Lycurgus in connection with the successive stages\r\n(1) of a citizen's life. It remains that I should endeavour to\r\ndescribe the style of living which he established for the whole body,\r\nirrespective of age. It will be understood that, when Lycurgus first\r\ncame to deal with the question, the Spartans like the rest of the\r\nHellenes, used to mess privately at home. Tracing more than half the\r\ncurrent misdemeanours to this custom, (2) he was determined to drag\r\nhis people out of holes and corners into the broad daylight, and so\r\nhe invented the public mess-rooms. Whereby he expected at any rate to\r\nminimise the transgression of orders.\r\n\r\n (1) Lit. \"with each age.\"; see Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 25; Hesychius, {s. u.\r\n    irinies}; \"Hell.\" VI. iv. 17; V. iv. 13.\r\n\r\n (2) Reading after Cobet, {en touto}.\r\n\r\nAs to food, (3) his ordinance allowed them so much as, while not\r\ninducing repletion, should guard them from actual want. And, in fact,\r\nthere are many exceptional (4) dishes in the shape of game supplied\r\nfrom the hunting field. Or, as a substitute for these, rich men will\r\noccasionally garnish the feast with wheaten loaves. So that from\r\nbeginning to end, till the mess breaks up, the common board is never\r\nstinted for viands, nor yet extravagantly furnished.\r\n\r\n (3) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 12 (Clough, i. 97).\r\n\r\n (4) {paraloga}, i.e. unexpected dishes, technically named {epaikla}\r\n    (hors d'oeuvres), as we learn from Athenaeus, iv. 140, 141.\r\n\r\nSo also in the matter of drink. Whilst putting a stop to all unnecessary\r\npotations, detrimental alike to a firm brain and a steady gait, (5) he\r\nleft them free to quench thirst when nature dictated (6); a method which\r\nwould at once add to the pleasure whilst it diminished the danger of\r\ndrinking. And indeed one may fairly ask how, on such a system of common\r\nmeals, it would be possible for any one to ruin either himself or his\r\nfamily either through gluttony or wine-bibbing.\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"apt to render brain and body alike unsteady.\"\r\n\r\n (6) See \"Agesilaus\"; also \"Mem.\" and \"Cyrop.\"\r\n\r\nThis too must be borne in mind, that in other states equals in age, (7)\r\nfor the most part, associate together, and such an atmosphere is little\r\nconducive to modesty. (8) Whereas in Sparta Lycurgus was careful so\r\nto blend the ages (9) that the younger men must benefit largely by the\r\nexperience of the elder--an education in itself, and the more so since\r\nby custom of the country conversation at the common meal has reference\r\nto the honourable acts which this man or that man may have performed in\r\nrelation to the state. The scene, in fact, but little lends itself to\r\nthe intrusion of violence or drunken riot; ugly speech and ugly deeds\r\nalike are out of place. Amongst other good results obtained through this\r\nout-door system of meals may be mentioned these: There is the necessity\r\nof walking home when the meal is over, and a consequent anxiety not to\r\nbe caught tripping under the influence of wine, since they all know of\r\ncourse that the supper-table must be presently abandoned, (10) and that\r\nthey must move as freely in the dark as in the day, even the help of a\r\ntorch (11) to guide the steps being forbidden to all on active service.\r\n\r\n (7) Cf. Plat. \"Phaedr.\" 240 C; {elix eklika terpei}, \"Equals delight\r\n    in equals.\"\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"these gatherings for the most part consist of equals in age\r\n    (young fellows), in whose society the virtue of modesty is least\r\n    likely to display itself.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 12 (Clough, i. 98).\r\n\r\n (10) Or, \"that they are not going to stay all night where they have\r\n    supped.\"\r\n\r\n (11) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 12 (Clough, i. 99).\r\n\r\nIn connection with this matter, Lycurgus had not failed to observe the\r\neffect of equal amounts of food on different persons. The hardworking\r\nman has a good complexion, his muscles are well fed, he is robust\r\nand strong. The man who abstains from work, on the other hand, may be\r\ndetected by his miserable appearance; he is blotched and puffy, and\r\ndevoid of strength. This observation, I say, was not wasted on him. On\r\nthe contrary, turning it over in his mind that any one who chooses, as\r\na matter of private judgment, to devote himself to toil may hope to\r\npresent a very creditable appearance physically, he enjoined upon the\r\neldest for the time being in every gymnasium to see to it that the\r\nlabours of the class were proportional to the meats. (12) And to my mind\r\nhe was not out of his reckoning in this matter more than elsewhere. At\r\nany rate, it would be hard to discover a healthier or more completely\r\ndeveloped human being, physically speaking, than the Spartan. Their\r\ngymnastic training, in fact, makes demands alike on the legs and arms\r\nand neck, (13) etc., simultaneously.\r\n\r\n (12) I.e. \"not inferior in excellence to the diet which they enjoyed.\"\r\n    The reading here adopted I owe to Dr. Arnold Hug, {os me ponous\r\n    auton elattous ton sition gignesthai}.\r\n\r\n (13) See Plat. \"Laws,\" vii. 796 A; Jowett, \"Plato,\" v. p. 365; Xen.\r\n    \"Symp.\" ii. 7; Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThere are other points in which this legislator's views run counter to\r\nthose commonly accepted. Thus: in other states the individual citizen\r\nis master over his own children, domestics, (1) goods and chattels, and\r\nbelongings generally; but Lycurgus, whose aim was to secure to all the\r\ncitizens a considerable share in one another's goods without mutual\r\ninjury, enacted that each one should have an equal power of his\r\nneighbour's children as over his own. (2) The principle is this. When a\r\nman knows that this, that, and the other person are fathers of children\r\nsubject to his authority, he must perforce deal by them even as he\r\ndesires his own child to be dealt by. And, if a boy chance to have\r\nreceived a whipping, not from his own father but some other, and goes\r\nand complains to his own father, it would be thought wrong on the part\r\nof that father if he did not inflict a second whipping on his son. A\r\nstriking proof, in its way, how completely they trust each other not to\r\nimpose dishonourable commands upon their children. (3)\r\n\r\n (1) Or rather, \"members of his household.\"\r\n\r\n (2) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 15 (Clough, i. 104).\r\n\r\n (3) See Plut. \"Moral.\" 237 D.\r\n\r\nIn the same way he empowered them to use their neighbour's (4) domestics\r\nin case of need. This communism he applied also to dogs used for the\r\nchase; in so far that a party in need of dogs will invite the owner to\r\nthe chase, and if he is not at leisure to attend himself, at any rate he\r\nis happy to let his dogs go. The same applies to the use of horses.\r\nSome one has fallen sick perhaps, or is in want of a carriage, (5) or\r\nis anxious to reach some point or other quickly--in any case he has a\r\nright, if he sees a horse anywhere, to take and use it, and restores it\r\nsafe and sound when he has done with it.\r\n\r\n (4) See Aristot. \"Pol.\" ii. 5 (Jowett, i. pp. xxxi. and 34; ii. p.\r\n    53); Plat. \"Laws,\" viii. 845 A; Newman, \"Pol. Aristot.\" ii. 249\r\n    foll.\r\n\r\n (5) \"Has not a carriage of his own.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here is another institution attributed to Lycurgus which scarcely\r\ncoincides with the customs elsewhere in vogue. A hunting party returns\r\nfrom the chase, belated. They want provisions--they have nothing\r\nprepared themselves. To meet this contingency he made it a rule that\r\nowners (6) are to leave behind the food that has been dressed; and the\r\nparty in need will open the seals, take out what they want, seal up the\r\nremainder, and leave it. Accordingly, by his system of give-and-take\r\neven those with next to nothing (7) have a share in all that the country\r\ncan supply, if ever they stand in need of anything.\r\n\r\n (6) Reading {pepamenous}, or if {pepasmenous}, \"who have already\r\n    finished their repasts.\"\r\n\r\n (7) See Aristot. \"Pol.\" ii. 9 (Jowett, i. pp. xlii. and 52); Muller,\r\n    \"Dorians,\" iii. 10, 1 (vol. ii. 197, Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThere are yet other customs in Sparta which Lycurgus instituted in\r\nopposition to those of the rest of Hellas, and the following among them.\r\nWe all know that in the generality of states every one devotes his full\r\nenergy to the business of making money: one man as a tiller of the soil,\r\nanother as a mariner, a third as a merchant, whilst others depend\r\non various arts to earn a living. But at Sparta Lycurgus forbade his\r\nfreeborn citizens to have anything whatsoever to do with the concerns\r\nof money-making. As freemen, he enjoined upon them to regard as their\r\nconcern exclusively those activities upon which the foundations of civic\r\nliberty are based.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, one may well ask, for what reason should wealth be regarded\r\nas a matter for serious pursuit (1) in a community where, partly by a\r\nsystem of equal contributions to the necessaries of life, and partly by\r\nthe maintenance of a common standard of living, the lawgiver placed so\r\neffectual a check upon the desire of riches for the sake of luxury? What\r\ninducement, for instance, would there be to make money, even for the\r\nsake of wearing apparel, in a state where personal adornment is held to\r\nlie not in the costliness of the clothes they wear, but in the healthy\r\ncondition of the body to be clothed? Nor again could there be much\r\ninducement to amass wealth, in order to be able to expend it on the\r\nmembers of a common mess, where the legislator had made it seem far more\r\nglorious that a man should help his fellows by the labour of his body\r\nthan by costly outlay. The latter being, as he finely phrased it, the\r\nfunction of wealth, the former an activity of the soul.\r\n\r\n (1) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 10 (Clough, i. 96).\r\n\r\nHe went a step further, and set up a strong barrier (even in a society\r\nsuch as I have described) against the pursuance of money-making by\r\nwrongful means. (2) In the first place, he established a coinage (3) of\r\nso extraordinary a sort, that even a single sum of ten minas (4) could\r\nnot come into a house without attracting the notice, either of the\r\nmaster himself, or of some member of his household. In fact, it would\r\noccupy a considerable space, and need a waggon to carry it. Gold and\r\nsilver themselves, moreover, are liable to search, (5) and in case of\r\ndetection, the possessor subjected to a penalty. In fact, to repeat\r\nthe question asked above, for what reason should money-making become an\r\nearnest pursuit in a community where the possession of wealth entails\r\nmore pain than its employment brings satisfaction?\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"against illegitimate commerce.\"\r\n\r\n (3) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 9 (Clough, i. 94).\r\n\r\n (4) = 40 pounds, circa.\r\n\r\n (5) See Grote, \"H. G.\" ix. 320; Aristot. \"Pol.\" ii. 9, 37.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nBut to proceed. We are all aware that there is no state (1) in the world\r\nin which greater obedience is shown to magistrates, and to the laws\r\nthemselves, than Sparta. But, for my part, I am disposed to think that\r\nLycurgus could never have attempted to establish this healthy condition,\r\n(2) until he had first secured the unanimity of the most powerful\r\nmembers of the state. I infer this for the following reasons. (3) In\r\nother states the leaders in rank and influence do not even desire to be\r\nthought to fear the magistrates. Such a thing they would regard as in\r\nitself a symbol of servility. In Sparta, on the contrary, the stronger\r\na man is the more readily does he bow before constituted authority.\r\nAnd indeed, they magnify themselves on their humility, and on a prompt\r\nobedience, running, or at any rate not crawling with laggard step,\r\nat the word of command. Such an example of eager discipline, they are\r\npersuaded, set by themselves, will not fail to be followed by the rest.\r\nAnd this is precisely what has taken place. It (4) is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that it was these same noblest members of the state who combined\r\n(5) to lay the foundation of the ephorate, after they had come to the\r\nconclusion themselves, that of all the blessings which a state, or an\r\narmy, or a household, can enjoy, obedience is the greatest. Since, as\r\nthey could not but reason, the greater the power with which men fence\r\nabout authority, the greater the fascination it will exercise upon the\r\nmind of the citizen, to the enforcement of obedience.\r\n\r\n (1) See Grote, \"H. G.\" v. 516; \"Mem.\" III. v. 18.\r\n\r\n (2) Or, reading after L. Dindorf, {eutaxian}, \"this world-renowned\r\n    orderliness.\"\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"from these facts.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"It was only natural that these same...\"\r\n\r\n (5) Or, \"helped.\" See Aristot. \"Pol.\" v. 11, 3; ii. 9, 1 (Jowett, ii.\r\n    224); Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 7, 29; Herod. i. 65; Muller, \"Dorians,\" iii.\r\n    7, 5 (vol. ii. p. 125, Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\nAccordingly the ephors are competent to punish whomsoever they choose;\r\nthey have power to exact fines on the spur of the moment; they have\r\npower to depose magistrates in mid career (6)--nay, actually to imprison\r\nthem and bring them to trial on the capital charge. Entrusted with\r\nthese vast powers, they do not, as do the rest of states, allow the\r\nmagistrates elected to exercise authority as they like, right through\r\nthe year of office; but, in the style rather of despotic monarchs, or\r\npresidents of the games, at the first symptom of an offence against the\r\nlaw they inflict chastisement without warning and without hesitation.\r\n\r\n (6) Or, \"before the expiration of their term of office.\" See Plut.\r\n    \"Agis,\" 18 (Clough, iv. 464); Cic. \"de Leg.\" iii. 7; \"de Rep.\" ii.\r\n    33.\r\n\r\nBut of all the many beautiful contrivances invented by Lycurgus to\r\nkindle a willing obedience to the laws in the hearts of the citizens,\r\nnone, to my mind, was happier or more excellent than his unwillingness\r\nto deliver his code to the people at large, until, attended by the most\r\npowerful members of the state, he had betaken himself to Delphi, (7)\r\nand there made inquiry of the god whether it were better for Sparta, and\r\nconducive to her interests, to obey the laws which he had framed. And\r\nnot until the divine answer came: \"Better will it be in every way,\"\r\ndid he deliver them, laying it down as a last ordinance that to refuse\r\nobedience to a code which had the sanction of the Pythian god himself\r\n(8) was a thing not illegal only, but profane.\r\n\r\n (7) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 5, 6, 29 (Clough, i. 89, 122); Polyb. x. 2, 9.\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"a code delivered in Pytho, spoken by the god himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe following too may well excite our admiration for Lycurgus. I speak\r\nof the consummate skill with which he induced the whole state of Sparta\r\nto regard an honourable death as preferable to an ignoble life. And\r\nindeed if any one will investigate the matter, he will find that by\r\ncomparison with those who make it a principle to retreat in face of\r\ndanger, actually fewer of these Spartans die in battle, since, to speak\r\ntruth, salvation, it would seem, attends on virtue far more frequently\r\nthan on cowardice--virtue, which is at once easier and sweeter, richer\r\nin resource and stronger of arm, (1) than her opposite. And that virtue\r\nhas another familiar attendant--to wit, glory--needs no showing, since\r\nthe whole world would fain ally themselves after some sort in battle\r\nwith the good.\r\n\r\n (1) See Homer, \"Il.\" v. 532; Tyrtaeus, 11, 14, {tressanton d' andron\r\n    pas' apolol arete}.\r\n\r\nYet the actual means by which he gave currency to these principles is a\r\npoint which it were well not to overlook. It is clear that the lawgiver\r\nset himself deliberately to provide all the blessings of heaven for the\r\ngood man, and a sorry and ill-starred existence for the coward.\r\n\r\nIn other states the man who shows himself base and cowardly wins to\r\nhimself an evil reputation and the nickname of a coward, but that is\r\nall. For the rest he buys and sells in the same market-place as the\r\ngood man; he sits beside him at play; he exercises with him in the same\r\ngymnasium, and all as suits his humour. But at Lacedaemon there is not\r\none man who would not feel ashamed to welcome the coward at the common\r\nmess-tabe, or to try conclusions with such an antagonist in a wrestling\r\nbout. Consider the day's round of his existence. The sides are being\r\npicked up in a football match, (2) but he is left out as the odd man:\r\nthere is no place for him. During the choric dance (3) he is driven away\r\ninto ignominious quarters. Nay, in the very streets it is he who must\r\nstep aside for others to pass, or, being seated, he must rise and make\r\nroom, even for a younger man. At home he will have his maiden relatives\r\nto support in isolation (and they will hold him to blame for their\r\nunwedded lives). (4) A hearth with no wife to bless it--that is a\r\ncondition he must face, (5) and yet he will have to pay damages to the\r\nlast farthing for incurring it. Let him not roam abroad with a smooth\r\nand smiling countenance; (6) let him not imitate men whose fame is\r\nirreproachable, or he shall feel on his back the blows of his superiors.\r\nSuch being the weight of infamy which is laid upon all cowards, I, for\r\nmy part, am not surprised if in Sparta they deem death preferable to a\r\nlife so steeped in dishonour and reproach.\r\n\r\n (2) See Lucian, \"Anacharsis,\" 38; Muller, \"Dorians,\" (vol. ii. 309,\r\n    Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\n (3) The {khoroi}, e.g. of the Gymnopaedia. See Muller, op. cit. iv. 6,\r\n    4 (vol. ii. 334, Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\n (4) {tes anandrias}, cf. Plut. \"Ages.\" 30; or, {tes anandreias}, \"they\r\n    must bear the reproach of his cowardice.\"\r\n\r\n (5) Omitting {ou}, or translate, \"that is an evil not to be\r\n    disregarded.\" See Dindorf, ad loc.; Sturz, \"Lex. Xen.\" {Estia}.\r\n\r\n (6) See Plut. \"Ages.\" 30 (Clough, iv. 36); \"Hell.\" VI. iv. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nThat too was a happy enactment, in my opinion, by which Lycurgus\r\nprovided for the continual cultivation of virtue, even to old age. By\r\nfixing (1) the election to the council of elders (2) as a last ordeal at\r\nthe goal of life, he made it impossible for a high standard of virtuous\r\nliving to be disregarded even in old age. (So, too, it is worthy of\r\nadmiration in him that he lent his helping hand to virtuous old age.\r\n(3) Thus, by making the elders sole arbiters in the trial for life, he\r\ncontrived to charge old age with a greater weight of honour than that\r\nwhich is accorded to the strength of mature manhood.) And assuredly\r\nsuch a contest as this must appeal to the zeal of mortal man beyond all\r\nothers in a supreme degree. Fair, doubtless, are contests of gymnastic\r\nskill, yet are they but trials of bodily excellence, but this contest\r\nfor the seniority is of a higher sort--it is an ordeal of the soul\r\nitself. In proportion, therefore, as the soul is worthier than the body,\r\nso must these contests of the soul appeal to a stronger enthusiasm than\r\ntheir bodily antitypes.\r\n\r\n (1) Reading {protheis}. See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 26 (Clough. i. 118);\r\n    Aristot. \"Pol.\" ii. 9, 25.\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"seniory,\" or \"senate,\" or \"board of elders\"; lit. \"the\r\n    Gerontia.\"\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"the old age of the good. Yet this he did when he made...\r\n    since he contrived,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnd yet another point may well excite our admiration for Lycurgus\r\nlargely. It had not escaped his observation that communities exist\r\nwhere those who are willing to make virtue their study and delight fail\r\nsomehow in ability to add to the glory of their fatherland. (4) That\r\nlesson the legislator laid to heart, and in Sparta he enforced, as a\r\nmatter of public duty, the practice of virtue by every citizen. And so\r\nit is that, just as man differs from man in some excellence, according\r\nas he cultivates or neglects to cultivate it, this city of Sparta, with\r\ngood reason, outshines all other states in virtue; since she, and she\r\nalone, as made the attainment of a high standard of noble living a\r\npublic duty.\r\n\r\n (4) Is this an autobiographical touch?\r\n\r\nAnd was this not a noble enactment, that whereas other states are\r\ncontent to inflict punishment only in cases where a man does wrong\r\nagainst his neighbour, Lycurgus imposed penalties no less severe on him\r\nwho openly neglected to make himself as good as possible? For this, it\r\nseems, was his principle: in the one case, where a man is robbed, or\r\ndefrauded, or kidnapped, and made a slave of, the injury of the misdeed,\r\nwhatever it be, is personal to the individual so maltreated; but in the\r\nother case whole communities suffer foul treason at the hands of the\r\nbase man and the coward. So that it was only reasonable, in my opinion,\r\nthat he should visit the heaviest penalty upon these latter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he laid upon them, like some irresistible necessity, the\r\nobligation to cultivate the whole virtue of a citizen. Provided they\r\nduly performed the injunctions of the law, the city belonged to them,\r\neach and all, in absolute possession and on an equal footing. Weakness\r\nof limb or want of wealth (5) was no drawback in his eyes. But as for\r\nhim who, out of the cowardice of his heart, shrank from the painful\r\nperformance of the law's injunction, the finger of the legislator\r\npointed him out as there and then disqualified to be regarded longer as\r\na member of the brotherhood of peers. (6)\r\n\r\n (5) But see Aristot. \"Pol.\" ii. 9, 32.\r\n\r\n (6) Grote, \"H. G.\" viii. 81; \"Hell.\" III. iii. 5.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, that there was no doubt as to the great antiquity of\r\nthis code of laws. The point is clear so far, that Lycurgus himself is\r\nsaid to have lived in the days of the Heraclidae. (7) But being of so\r\nlong standing, these laws, even at this day, still are stamped in the\r\neyes of other men with all the novelty of youth. And the most marvellous\r\nthing of all is that, while everybody is agreed to praise these\r\nremarkable institutions, there is not a single state which cares to\r\nimitate them.\r\n\r\n (7) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThe above form a common stock of blessings, open to every Spartan to\r\nenjoy, alike in peace and in war. But if any one desires to be informed\r\nin what way the legislator improved upon the ordinary machinery of\r\nwarfare and in reference to an army in the field, it is easy to satisfy\r\nhis curiosity.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the ephors announce by proclamation the limit of\r\nage to which the service applies (1) for cavalry and heavy infantry;\r\nand in the next place, for the various handicraftsmen. So that, even\r\non active service, the Lacedaemonians are well supplied with all the\r\nconveniences enjoyed by people living as citizens at home. (2) All\r\nimplements and instruments whatsoever, which an army may need in common,\r\nare ordered to be in readiness, (3) some on waggons and others on\r\nbaggage animals. In this way anything omitted can hardly escape\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\n (1) I.e. \"in the particular case.\" See \"Hell.\" VI. iv. 17; Muller,\r\n    \"Dorians,\" iii. 12 (vol. ii. 242 foll., Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"the conveniences of civil life at home.\"\r\n\r\n (3) Reading {parekhein}, or if {paragein}, \"to be conveyed.\" Cf.\r\n    Pausan.

The soldier has a crimson-coloured uniform and a\r\nheavy shield of bronze; his theory being that such an equipment has no\r\nsort of feminine association, and is altogether most warrior-like. (4)\r\nIt is most quickly burnished; it is least readily soiled. (5)\r\n\r\n (4) Cf. Aristoph. \"Acharn.\" 320, and the note of the scholiast.\r\n\r\n (5) See Ps. Plut. \"Moral.\" 238 F.\r\n\r\nHe further permitted those who were above the age of early manhood to\r\nwear their hair long. (6) For so, he conceived, they would appear\r\nof larger stature, more free and indomitable, and of a more terrible\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n (6) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 22 (Clough, i. 114).\r\n\r\nSo furnished and accoutred, he divided his citizen soldiers into six\r\nmorai (7) (or regimental divisions) of cavalry (8) and heavy infantry.\r\nEach of these citizen regiments (political divisions) has one polemarch\r\n(9) (or colonel), four lochagoi (or captains of companies), eight\r\npenteconters (or lieutenants, each in command of half a company), and\r\nsixteen enomotarchs (or commanders of sections). At the word of command\r\nany such regimental division can be formed readily either into enomoties\r\n(i.e. single file) or into threes (i.e. three files abreast), or into\r\nsixes (i.e. six files abreast).

In fact, this disposition is so easy to understand\r\nthat no one who can distinguish one human being from another could fail\r\nto follow it. One set have the privilege of leaders, the other the duty\r\nof followers. The evolutional orders, (12) by which greater depth or\r\nshallowness is given to the battle line, are given by word of mouth by\r\nthe enomotarch (or commander of the section), who plays the part of the\r\nherald, and they cannot be mistaken.

G.\" vii. 108; Thuc. v. 66;\r\n    also Rustow and Kochly, op. cit. p. 111, S. 8, note 19; p. 121,\r\n    $17, note 41.\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to their ability to do battle equally well in spite\r\nof some confusion which has been set up, and whatever the chapter of\r\naccidents may confront them with, (13) I admit that the tactics here are\r\nnot so easy to understand, except for people trained under the laws of\r\nLycurgus. Even movements which an instructor in heavy-armed warfare (14)\r\nmight look upon as difficult are performed by the Lacedaemonians with\r\nthe utmost ease. (15) Thus, the troops, we will suppose, are marching in\r\ncolumn; one section of a company is of course stepping up behind another\r\nfrom the rear. (16) Now, if at such a moment a hostile force appears in\r\nfront in battle order, the word is passed down to the commander of each\r\nsection, \"Deploy (into line) to the left.\" And so throughout the whole\r\nlength of the column, until the line is formed facing the enemy. Or\r\nsupposing while in this position an enemy appears in the rear. Each file\r\nperforms a counter-march (17) with the effect of bringing the best men\r\nface to face with the enemy all along the line. (18) As to the point\r\nthat the leader previously on the right finds himself now on the left,\r\n(19) they do not consider that they are necessarily losers thereby, but,\r\nas it may turn out, even gainers. If, for instance, the enemy attempted\r\nto turn their flank, he would find himself wrapping round, not their\r\nexposed, but their shielded flank. (20) Or if, for any reason, it be\r\nthought advisable for the general to keep the right wing, they turn the\r\ncorps about, (21) and counter-march by ranks, until the leader is on the\r\nright, and the rear rank on the left. Or again, supposing a division of\r\nthe enemy appears on the right whilst they are marching in column, they\r\nhave nothing further to do but to wheel each company to the right, like\r\na trireme, prow forwards, (22) to meet the enemy, and thus the rear\r\ncompany again finds itself on the right. If, however, the enemy should\r\nattack on the left, either they will not allow of that and push him\r\naside, (23) or else they wheel their companies to the left to face the\r\nantagonist, and thus the rear company once more falls into position on\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"alongside of any comrade who may have fallen in their way.\"\r\n    See Plut. \"Pelop.\" 23 (Clough, ii. 222); Thuc. v. 72.\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"drill sergeant.\"\r\n\r\n (15) See Jebb, note to \"Theophr.\" viii. 3.\r\n\r\n (16) Or, \"marching in rear of another.\"\r\n\r\n (17) See Rustow and Kochly, p. 127.\r\n\r\n (18) Or, \"every time.\"\r\n\r\n (19) See Thuc. v. 67, 71.\r\n\r\n (20) See Rustow and Kochly, p. 127.\r\n\r\n (21) For these movements, see \"Dict. of Antiq.\" \"Exercitus\"; Grote,\r\n    \"H. G.\" vii. 111.\r\n\r\n (22) See \"Hell.\" VII. v. 23.\r\n\r\n (23) I am indebted to Professor Jebb for the following suggestions\r\n    with regard to this passage: \"The words {oude touto eosin, all\r\n    apothousin e}, etc., contain some corruption. The sense ought\r\n    clearly to be roughly parallel with that of the phrase used a\r\n    little before, {ouden allo pragmateuontai e}, etc. Perhaps\r\n    {apothousin} is a corruption of {apothen ousin}, and this\r\n    corruption occasioned the insertion of {e}. Probably Xenophon\r\n    wrote {oude touto eosin, all apothen ousin antipalous}, etc.:\r\n    'while the enemy is still some way off, they turn their companies\r\n    so as to face him.' The words {apothen ousin} indirectly suggest\r\n    the celerity of the Spartan movement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nI will now speak of the mode of encampment sanctioned by the regulation\r\nof Lycurgus. To avoid the waste incidental to the angles of a square,\r\n(1) the encampment, according to him, should be circular, except where\r\nthere was the security of a hill, (2) or fortification, or where they\r\nhad a river in their rear. He had sentinels posted during the day along\r\nthe place of arms and facing inwards; (3) since they are appointed not\r\nso much for the sake of the enemy as to keep an eye on friends. The\r\nenemy is sufficiently watched by mounted troopers perched on various\r\npoints commanding the widest prospect.\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"Regarding the angles of a square as a useless inconvenience,\r\n    he arranged that an encampment should be circular,\" etc. See\r\n    Polyb. vi. 31, 42.\r\n\r\n (2) Cf. \"Hell.\" VI. iv. 14; Polyaen. II. iii. 11, ap. Schneider.\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"these,\" {tas men}. Or, \"He had lines of sentinels posted\r\n    throughout the day; one line facing inwards towards the place of\r\n    arms (and these were appointed, etc.); while observation of the\r\n    enemy was secured by mounted troopers,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTo guard against hostile approach by night, sentinel duty according to\r\nthe ordinance was performed by the Sciritae (4) outside the main\r\nbody. At the present time the rule is so far modified that the duty is\r\nentrusted to foreigners, (5) if there be a foreign contingent present,\r\nwith a leaven of Spartans themselves to keep them company. (6)\r\n\r\n (4) See Muller's \"Dorians,\" ii. 253; \"Hell.\" VI. v. 24; \"Cyrop.\" IV.\r\n    ii. 1; Thuc. v. 67, 71; Grote, \"H. G.\" vii. 110.\r\n\r\n (5) See \"Hipparch.\" ix. 4.\r\n\r\n (6) Reading {auton de}. The passage is probably corrupt. See L.\r\n    Dindorf ad loc.\r\n\r\nThe custom of always taking their spears (7) with them when they go\r\ntheir rounds must certainly be attributed to the same cause which\r\nmakes them exclude their slaves from the place of arms. Nor need we be\r\nsurprised if, when retiring for necessary purposes, they only withdraw\r\njust far enough from one another, or from the place of arms itself, not\r\nto create annoyance. The need of precaution is the whole explanation.\r\n\r\n (7) See Critias, ap. Schneider ad loc.\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which they change their encampments is another point.\r\nIt is done quite as much for the sake of benefiting their friends as of\r\nannoying their enemies.\r\n\r\nFurther, the law enjoins upon all Lacedaemonians, during the whole\r\nperiod of an expedition, the constant practice of gymnastic (8)\r\nexercises, whereby their pride (9) in themselves is increased, and they\r\nappear freer and of a more liberal aspect than the rest of the world.\r\n(10) The walk and the running ground must not exceed in length (11) the\r\nspace covered by a regimental division, (12) so that no one may find\r\nhimself far from his own stand of arms. After the gymnastic exercises\r\nthe senior polemarch gives the order (by herald) to be seated. This\r\nserves all the purposes of an inspection. After this the order is given\r\n\"to get breakfast,\" and for \"the outposts (13) to be relieved.\" After\r\nthis, again, come pastimes and relaxations before the evening exercises,\r\nafter which the herald's cry is heard \"to take the evening meal.\" When\r\nthey have sung a hymn to the gods to whom the offerings of happy omen\r\nhad been performed, the final order, \"Retire to rest at the place of\r\narms,\" (14) is given.\r\n\r\n (8) Cf. Herod. vii. 208; Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 22 (Clough, i. 113 foll.)\r\n\r\n (9) Reading {megalophronesterous} (L. Dindorf's emendation) for the\r\n    vulg. {megaloprepesterous}. Xen \"Opusc. polit.\" Ox.

See \"Cyrop.\" II. iv.\r\n    27, and L. Dindorf ad loc.\r\n\r\n (12) A single mora, or an army corps.\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"vedettes,\" {proskopon}. See \"Cyrop.\" V. ii. 6.\r\n\r\n (14)? Or, \"on your arms.\" See Sturz, \"Lex. Xen.\" s.v.\r\n\r\nIf the story is a little long the reader must not be surprised, since it\r\nwould be difficult to find any point in military matters omitted by the\r\nLacedaemonians which seems to demand attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nI will now give a detailed account of the power and privilege assigned\r\nby Lycurgus to the king during a campaign. To begin with, so long as he\r\nis on active service, the state maintains the king and those with him.\r\n(1) The polemarchs mess with him and share his quarters, so that by dint\r\nof constant intercourse they may be all the better able to consult in\r\ncommon in case of need. Besides the polemarch three other members of the\r\npeers (2) share the royal quarters, mess, etc. The duty of these is to\r\nattend to all matters of commisariat, (3) in order that the king and the\r\nrest may have unbroken leisure to attend to affairs of actual warfare.\r\n\r\n (1) I.e. \"the Thirty.\" See \"Ages.\" i. 7; \"Hell.\" III. iv. 2; Plut.\r\n    \"Ages.\" 6 (Clough, iv. 6); Aristot. \"Pol.\" ii. 9, 29.\r\n\r\n (2) For these {oi omoioi}, see \"Cyrop.\" I. v. 5; \"Hell.\" III. iii. 5.\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"supplies and necessaries.\"\r\n\r\nBut I will resume at a somewhat higher point and describe the manner in\r\nwhich the king sets out on an expedition. As a preliminary step, before\r\nleaving home he offers sacrifice (in company with (4) his staff) to Zeus\r\nAgetor (the Leader), and if the victims prove favourable then and there\r\nthe priest, (5) who bears the sacred fire, takes thereof from off the\r\naltar and leads the way to the boundaries of the land. Here for the\r\nsecond time the king does sacrifice (6) to Zeus and Athena; and as soon\r\nas the offerings are accepted by those two divinities he steps across\r\nthe boundaries of the land. And all the while the fire from those\r\nsacrifices leads the way, and is never suffered to go out. Behind follow\r\nbeasts for sacrifice of every sort.\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. reading {kai oi sun auto}, after L. Dindorf, \"he and those\r\n    with him.\"\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"the Purphuros.\" See Nic. Damasc. ap. Stob. \"Fl.\" 44, 41;\r\n    Hesych. ap. Schneider, n. ad loc.\r\n\r\n (6) These are the {diabateria}, so often mentioned in the \"Hellenica.\"\r\n\r\nInvariably when he offers sacrifice the king begins the work in the\r\ngloaming ere the day has broken, being minded to anticipate the goodwill\r\nof the god. And round about the place of sacrifice are present the\r\npolemarchs and captains, the lieutenants and sub-lieutenants, with the\r\ncommandants of the baggage train, and any general of the states (7) who\r\nmay care to assist. There, too, are to be seen two of the ephors, who\r\nneither meddle nor make, save only at the summons of the king, yet have\r\nthey their eyes fixed on the proceedings of each one there and keep\r\nall in order, (8) as may well be guessed. When the sacrifices are\r\naccomplished the king summons all and issues his orders (9) as to\r\nwhat has to be done. And all with such method that, to witness the\r\nproceedings, you might fairly suppose the rest of the world to be\r\nbut bungling experimenters, (10) and the Lacedaemonians alone true\r\nhandicraftsmen in the art of soldiering.\r\n\r\n (7) I.e. \"allied\"? or \"perioecid\"?\r\n\r\n (8) {sophronizousin}, \"keep every one in his sober senses.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See Thuc. v. 66.\r\n\r\n (10) {autoskhediastai, tekhnitai}. See Jebb, \"Theophr.\" x. 3.\r\n\r\nAnon the king puts himself at the head of the troops, and if no enemy\r\nappears he heads the line of march, no one preceding him except the\r\nSciritae, and the mounted troopers exploring in front. (11) If, however,\r\nthere is any reason to anticipate a battle, the king takes the leading\r\ncolumn of the first army corps (12) and wheels to the right until he has\r\ngot into position with two army corps and two generals of division on\r\neither flank. The disposition of the supports is assigned to the eldest\r\nof the royal council (13) (or staff corps) acting as brigadier--the\r\nstaff consisting of all peers who share the royal mess and quarters,\r\nwith the soothsayers, surgeons, (14) and pipers, whose place is in the\r\nfront of the troops, (15) with, finally, any volunteers who happen to be\r\npresent. So that there is no check or hesitation in anything to be done;\r\nevery contingency is provided for.\r\n\r\n (11) Or, \"who are on scouting duty. If, however, they expect a\r\n    battle,\" etc.\r\n\r\n (12) Technically, \"mora.\"\r\n\r\n (13) {ton peri damosian}. See \"Hell.\" IV. v. 8; vii. 4.\r\n\r\n (14) See \"Anab.\" III. iv. 30; \"Cyrop.\" I. vi. 15; L. Dindorf, n. ad\r\n    loc.\r\n\r\n (15) Schneider refers to Polyaenus, i. 10.\r\n\r\nThe following details also seem to me of high utility among the\r\ninventions of Lycurgus with a view to the final arbitrament of battle.\r\nWhensoever, the enemy being now close enough to watch the proceedings,\r\n(16) the goat is sacrificed; then, says the law, let all the pipers,\r\nin their places, play upon the pipes, and let every Lacedaemonian don\r\na wreath. Then, too, so runs the order, let the shields be brightly\r\npolished. The privilege is accorded to the young man to enter battle\r\nwith his long locks combed. (17) To be of cheery countenance--that,\r\ntoo, is of good repute. Onwards they pass the word of command to the\r\nsubaltern (18) in command of his section, since it is impossible to hear\r\nalong the whole of each section from the particular subaltern posted on\r\nthe outside. It devolves, finally, on the polemarch to see that all goes\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n (16) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 22 (Clough, i. 114); and for the goat\r\n    sacrificed to Artemis Agrotera, see \"Hell.\" IV. ii. 20; Pause. IX.\r\n    xiii. 4; Plut. \"Marcell.\" 22 (Clough, ii. 264).\r\n\r\n (17) See Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 22 (Clough, i. 114). The passage is corrupt,\r\n    and possibly out of its place. I cite the words as they run in the\r\n    MSS. with various proposed emendations. See Schneider, n. ad loc.\r\n    {exesti de to neo kai kekrimeno eis makhen sunienai kai phaidron\r\n    einai kai eudokimon. kai parakeleuontai de k.t.l.} Zeune,\r\n    {kekrimeno komen}, after Plut. \"Lycurg.\" 22. Weiske, {kai komen\r\n    diakekrimeno}. Cobet, {exesti de to neo liparo kai tas komas\r\n    diakekrimeno eis makhen ienai}.\r\n\r\n (18) Lit. \"to the enomotarch.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the right moment for encamping has come, the king is responsible\r\nfor that, and has to point out the proper place. The despatch of\r\nemissaries, however, whether to friends or to foes, is (not) (19) the\r\nking's affair. Petitioners in general wishing to transact anything\r\ntreat, in the first instance, with the king. If the case concerns some\r\npoint of justice, the king despatches the petitioner to the Hellanodikai\r\n(who form the court-martial); if of money, to the paymasters. (20) If\r\nthe petitioner brings booty, he is sent off to the Laphuropolai (or\r\nsellers of spoil). This being the mode of procedure, no other duty is\r\nleft to the king, whilst he is on active service, except to play the\r\npart of priest in matters concerning the gods and of commander-in-chief\r\nin his relationship to men. (21)\r\n\r\n (19) The MSS. give {au}, \"is again,\" but the word {mentoi}, \"however,\"\r\n    and certain passages in \"Hell.\" II. ii. 12, 13; II. iv. 38 suggest\r\n    the negative {ou} in place of {au}. If {au} be right, then we\r\n    should read {ephoren} in place of {basileos}, \"belongs to the\r\n    ephors.\"\r\n\r\n (20) Technically the {tamiai}.\r\n\r\n (21) See Aristot. \"Pol.\" iii. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV (1)\r\n\r\nNow, if the question be put to me, Do you maintain that the laws of\r\nLycurgus remain still to this day unchanged? that indeed is an assertion\r\nwhich I should no longer venture to maintain; knowing, as I do, that in\r\nformer times the Lacedaemonians preferred to live at home on moderate\r\nmeans, content to associate exclusively with themselves rather than\r\nto play the part of governor-general (2) in foreign states and to be\r\ncorrupted by flattery; knowing further, as I do, that formerly they\r\ndreaded to be detected in the possession of gold, whereas nowadays there\r\nare not a few who make it their glory and their boast to be possessed of\r\nit. I am very well aware that in former days alien acts (3) were put\r\nin force for this very object. To live abroad was not allowed. And why?\r\nSimply in order that the citizens of Sparta might not take the infection\r\nof dishonesty and light-living from foreigners; whereas now I am very\r\nwell aware that those who are reputed to be leading citizens have\r\nbut one ambition, and that is to live to the end of their days as\r\ngovernors-general on a foreign soil. (4) The days were when their sole\r\nanxiety was to fit themselves to lead the rest of Hellas. But nowadays\r\nthey concern themselves much more to wield command than to be fit\r\nthemselves to rule. And so it has come to pass that whereas in old days\r\nthe states of Hellas flocked to Lacedaemon seeking her leadership (5)\r\nagainst the supposed wrongdoer, now numbers are inviting one another to\r\nprevent the Lacedaemonians again recovering their empire. (6) Yet, if\r\nthey have incurred all these reproaches, we need not wonder, seeing that\r\nthey are so plainly disobedient to the god himself and to the laws of\r\ntheir own lawgiver Lycurgus.\r\n\r\n (1) For the relation of this chapter to the rest of the treatise, see\r\n    Grote, ix. 325; Ern. Naumann, \"de Xen. libro qui\" {LAK. POLITEIA}\r\n    inscribitur, p. 18 foll.; Newmann, \"Pol. Aristot.\" ii. 326.\r\n\r\n (2) Harmosts.\r\n\r\n (3) \"Xenelasies,\" {xenelasiai} technically called.

He granted him to receive honorary gifts of the things offered\r\nin sacrifice, and he appointed him choice land in many of the provincial\r\ncities, enough to satisfy moderate needs without excess of wealth. And\r\nin order that the kings also might camp and mess in public he appointed\r\nthem public quarters; and he honoured them with a double portion (3)\r\neach at the evening meal, not in order that they might actually eat\r\ntwice as much as others, but that the king might have wherewithal to\r\nhonour whomsoever he desired. He also granted as a gift to each of the\r\ntwo kings to choose two mess-fellows, which same are called Puthioi. He\r\nalso granted them to receive out of every litter of swine one pig, so\r\nthat the king might never be at a loss for victims if in aught he wished\r\nto consult the gods.\r\n\r\n (2) I.e. a Heracleid, in whichever line descended, and, through\r\n    Heracles, from Zeus himself. The kings are therefore \"heroes,\"\r\n    i.e. demigods. See below; and for their privileges, see Herod. vi.\r\n    56, 57.\r\n\r\n (3) See \"Ages.\" v. 1.\r\n\r\nClose by the palace a lake affords an unrestricted supply of water; and\r\nhow useful that is for various purposes they best can tell who lack the\r\nluxury. (4) Moreover, all rise from their seats to give place to the\r\nking, save only that the ephors rise not from their thrones of office.\r\nMonthly they exchange oaths, the ephors in behalf of the state, the king\r\nhimself in his own behalf. And this is the oath on the king's part: \"I\r\nwill exercise my kingship in accordance with the established laws of the\r\nstate.\" And on the part of the state the oath runs: \"So long as he (5)\r\n(who exercises kingship) shall abide by his oaths we will not suffer his\r\nkingdom to be shaken.\" (6)\r\n\r\n (4) See Hartman, \"An. Xen. N.\" p. 274; but cf. \"Cyneget.\" v. 34;\r\n    \"Anab.\" V. iii. 8.\r\n\r\n (5) Lit. \"he yonder.\"\r\n\r\n (6) Lit. \"we will keep it for him unshaken.\" See L. Dindorf, n. ad\r\n    loc. and praef. p. 14 D.\r\n\r\nThese then are the honours bestowed upon the king during his lifetime\r\n(at home) (7)--honours by no means much exceeding those of private\r\ncitizens, since the lawgiver was minded neither to suggest to the kings\r\nthe pride of the despotic monarch, (8) nor, on the other hand, to\r\nengender in the heart of the citizen envy of their power. As to those\r\nother honours which are given to the king at his death, (9) the laws of\r\nLycurgus would seem plainly to signify hereby that these kings of\r\nLacedaemon are not mere mortals but heroic beings, and that is why they\r\nare preferred in honour. (10)\r\n\r\n (7) The words \"at home\" look like an insertion.\r\n\r\n (8) Lit. \"the tyrant's pride.\"\r\n\r\n (9) See \"Hell.\" III. iii. 1; \"Ages.\" xi. 16; Herod. vi. 58.\r\n\r\n (10) Intentionally or not on the part of the writer, the concluding\r\n    words, in which the intention of the Laws is conveyed, assume a\r\n    metrical form:\r\n\r\n        {oukh os anthropous all os eroas tous\r\n         Lakedaimonion basileis protetimekasin.}\r\n\r\n    See Ern.
