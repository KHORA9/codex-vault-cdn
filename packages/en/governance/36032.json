FOSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION BY\r\nJOHN A. FITCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\nB. W. HUEBSCH, INC.\r\nMCMXX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1920, BY B. W. HUEBSCH, INC.\r\nPRINTED IN U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a million men are employed in the steel industry of the United\r\nStates. At a period in which eight hours is rapidly coming to be\r\naccepted as the standard length of the working day, the principal mills\r\nin this industry are operating on a 12-hour work schedule, and many of\r\ntheir workmen are employed seven days in every week. These half million\r\nmen have, for the most part, no opportunity to discuss with their\r\nemployers the conditions of their work. Not only are they denied the\r\nright of bargaining collectively over the terms of the labor contract,\r\nbut if grievances arise in the course of their employment they have no\r\nright in any effective manner to take up the matter with their employer\r\nand secure an equitable adjustment.[1] The right even of petition has\r\nbeen at times denied and, because of the organized strength of the steel\r\ncompanies and the disorganized weakness of the employees, could be\r\ndenied at any time.\r\n\r\nThe right of workers in this country to organize and to bargain\r\ncollectively is unquestioned. On every hand the workers are exercising\r\nthis right in order to protect and advance their interests. In the steel\r\nmills not only is the right generally denied but the attempt to exercise\r\nit is punished by expulsion from the industry. Through a system of\r\nespionage that is thoroughgoing and effective the steel companies know\r\nwhich of their employees are attending union meetings, which of them are\r\ntalking with organizers. It is their practice to discharge such men and\r\nthus they nip in the bud any ordinary movement toward organization.\r\n\r\nTheir power to prevent their employees from acting independently and in\r\ntheir own interest, extends even to the communities in which they live.\r\nIn towns where the mayor's chair is occupied by company officials or\r\ntheir relatives--as was the case during the 1919 strike in Bethlehem,\r\nDuquesne, Clairton and elsewhere--orders may be issued denying to the\r\nworkers the right to hold meetings for organizing purposes, or the\r\npolice may be instructed to break them up. Elsewhere--as in Homestead,\r\nMcKeesport, Monessen, Rankin and in Pittsburgh itself--the economic\r\nstrength of the companies is so great as to secure the willing\r\ncooperation of officials or to compel owners of halls and vacant lots to\r\nrefuse the use of their property for the holding of union meetings.\r\n\r\nOne who has not seen with his own eyes the evidences of steel company\r\ncontrol in the towns where their plants are located will have difficulty\r\nin comprehending its scope and power. Social and religious organizations\r\nare profoundly affected by it. In many a church during the recent\r\nstrike, ministers and priests denounced the \"agitators\" and urged the\r\nworkmen in their congregations to go back to the mills. Small business\r\nmen accepted deputy sheriffs' commissions, put revolvers in their belts\r\nand talked loudly about the merits of a firing squad as a remedy for\r\nindustrial unrest.\r\n\r\nFor twenty or more years in the mill towns along the Monongahela--since\r\n1892 in Homestead--the working men have lived in an atmosphere of\r\nespionage and repression. The deadening influence of an overwhelming\r\npower, capable of crushing whatever does not bend to its will, has in\r\nthese towns stifled individual initiative and robbed citizenship of its\r\nvirility.\r\n\r\nThe story of the most extensive and most courageous fight yet made to\r\nbreak this power and to set free the half million men of the steel mills\r\nis told within the pages of this book by one who was himself a leader in\r\nthe fight. It is a story that is worth the telling, for it has been told\r\nbefore only in fragmentary bits and without the authority that comes\r\nfrom the pen of one of the chief actors in the struggle.\r\n\r\nMr. Foster has performed a public service in setting down as he has the\r\nessential facts attendant upon the calling of the strike. The record of\r\ncorrespondence with Judge Gary and with President Wilson indicates\r\nclearly enough where responsibility for its occurrence lies. It answers\r\nthe question also of who it was that flouted the President--the strike\r\ncommittee that refused to enter into a one sided truce, or Judge Gary,\r\nwho would not accept Mr. Wilson's suggestion that he confer with a union\r\ncommittee, but who was willing to take advantage of the proposed truce\r\nto undermine and destroy the union.\r\n\r\nThis thoughtful history, remarkably dispassionate upon the whole,\r\nconsidering the fact that the author was not only an actor in the events\r\nhe describes but the storm center of a countrywide campaign of\r\nslanderous falsehood, is an effective answer to those whose method of\r\nopposing the strike was to shout \"Bolshevism\" and \"Revolution.\" Not thus\r\nare fomenters of revolution accustomed to write. It is this very quality\r\nwhich will make the book of great value both to the student and to the\r\nlabor organizer. Never before has a leader in a great organizing\r\ncampaign like the one preceding the steel strike sat down afterward to\r\nappraise so calmly the causes of defeat. Explanations of failure are\r\ncommon, usually in the form of \"alibis.\" Mr. Foster has been willing to\r\nlook the facts steadily in the face and his analysis of the causes of\r\nthe loss of the strike--laying the responsibility for it at the doors of\r\nthe unions themselves--cannot fail to be helpful to every union leader,\r\nno matter what industry his union may represent. On the other hand his\r\naccount of such a feat as the maintenance of a commissary adequate to\r\nmeet the needs of the strikers at a cost of $1.40 per man is suggestive\r\nand encouraging to the highest degree. This achievement must stand as a\r\nmonument to the integrity and practical ability of the men who conducted\r\nthe strike.\r\n\r\nIt is with no purpose of underwriting every statement of fact or of\r\nmaking his own every theory advanced in the book that the writer\r\nexpresses his confidence in it. It is because the book as a whole is so\r\nwell done and because the essential message that it conveys is so true,\r\nthat it is a pleasure to write these words of introduction. Other books\r\nhave been written about the steel industry. Some have concerned\r\nthemselves with metallurgy, others with the commercial aspects of steel\r\nmanufacture, and still others with certain phases of the labor problem.\r\nThis book is different from all the others. It sets forth as no other\r\nbook has, and as no other writer could, the need of the workers in this\r\ngreat basic industry for organization, and the extreme difficulty of\r\nachieving this essential right. It shows also in the sanity, good\r\ntemper, and straightforward speech of the author what sort of leadership\r\nit is that the steel companies have decreed their workers shall not\r\nhave!\r\n\r\n  JOHN A.

He told of a strike which occurred because a\r\ngrievance remained unadjusted after a committee of the workers had tried\r\nto take it up with the management. The president of the company involved\r\nwas for crushing the strike without knowing what the grievance was or\r\neven of the existence of the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                        v\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n      I.

Begun on\r\nSeptember 22, 1919, by 365,600 men quitting their places in the iron and\r\nsteel mills and blast furnaces in fifty cities of ten states, it ended\r\non January 8, 1920, when the organizations affiliated in the National\r\nCommittee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers voted to permit the\r\n100,000 or more men still on strike to return to work upon the best\r\nterms they could secure.\r\n\r\nThe steel manufacturers \"won\" the strike. By forcing an unconditional\r\nsurrender, they drove their men back to the old slavery. This they\r\naccomplished in their wonted and time-honored way by carrying on a reign\r\nof terror that outraged every just conception of civil and human rights.\r\nIn this unholy task they were aided by a crawling, subservient and\r\nlying press, which spewed forth its poison propaganda in their behalf;\r\nby selfish and indifferent local church movements, which had long since\r\nlost their Christian principles in an ignominious scramble for company\r\nfavors; and by hordes of unscrupulous municipal, county, state and\r\nfederal officials, whose eagerness to wear the steel collar was equalled\r\nonly by their forgetfulness of their oaths of office. No suppression of\r\nfree speech and free assembly, no wholesale clubbing, shooting and\r\njailing of strikers and their families was too revolting for these Steel\r\nTrust[2] hangers-on to carry out with relish. With the notable exception\r\nof a few honorable and courageous individuals here and there among these\r\nhostile elements, it was an alignment of the steel companies, the state,\r\nthe courts, the local churches and the press against the steel workers.\r\n\r\nUpon the ending of the strike the steel workers got no direct\r\nconcessions from their employers. Those who were able to evade the\r\nbitter blacklist were compelled to surrender their union cards and to\r\nreturn to work under conditions that are a shame and a disgrace. They\r\nwere driven back to the infamous peonage system with its twelve hour\r\nday, a system which American steel workers, of all those in the world,\r\nalone have to endure. In England, France, Italy and Germany, the steel\r\nworkers enjoy the right of a voice in the control of their industry;\r\nthey regularly barter and bargain with their employers over the\r\nquestions of hours, wages and working conditions; they also have the\r\neight hour day. One must come to America, the land of freedom, to find\r\nsteel workers still economically disfranchised and compelled to work\r\ntwelve hours a day. In this country alone the human rights of the steel\r\nworkers are crushed under foot by the triumphant property rights of\r\ntheir employers.\r\n\r\nWho can uphold this indefensible position? Are not our deposits of coal\r\nand iron immeasurably greater, our mills more highly developed, our\r\nlabor force more numerous and more skilled than those of any other\r\ncountry? Who then will venture to assert that American workingmen are\r\nnot entitled to exercise all the rights and privileges enjoyed by\r\nEuropean workingmen? If the steel workers of England, or France, or\r\nItaly, or Germany can practice collective bargaining, why not the steel\r\nworkers of America? And why should the steel workers here have to work\r\ntwelve hours daily when the eight hour day obtains abroad?\r\n\r\nThere are a hundred good reasons why the principles of collective\r\nbargaining and the shorter workday should prevail in the steel industry\r\nof America, and only one why they should not. This one reason is that\r\nthe industry is hard and fast in the grip of absentee capitalists who\r\ntake no part in production and whose sole function is to seize by hook\r\nor crook the product of the industry and consume it. These parasites, in\r\ntheir voracious quest of profits, know neither pity nor responsibility.\r\nTheir reckless motto is \"After us the deluge.\" They care less than\r\nnaught for the rights and sufferings of the workers. Ignoring the\r\ninevitable weakening of patriotism of people living under miserable\r\nindustrial conditions, they go their way, prostituting, strangling and\r\ndismembering our most cherished institutions. And the worst of it is\r\nthat in the big strike an ignorant public, miseducated by employers'\r\npropaganda sheets masquerading under the guise of newspapers, applauded\r\nthem in their ruthless course. Blindly this public, setting itself up as\r\nthe great arbiter of what is democratic and American, condemned as\r\nbolshevistic and ruinous the demands of almost 400,000 steel workers for\r\nsimple, fundamental reforms, without which hardly a pretense of freedom\r\nis possible, and lauded as sturdy Americanism the desperate autocracy of\r\nthe Steel Trust. All its guns were turned against the strikers.\r\n\r\nIn this great struggle the mill owners may well claim the material\r\nvictory; but with just as much right the workers can claim the moral\r\nvictory. For the strike left in every aspiring breast a spark of hope\r\nwhich must burn on till it finally bursts into a flame of\r\nfreedom-bringing revolt. For a generation steel workers had been\r\nhopeless. Their slavery had overwhelmed them. The trade-union movement\r\nseemed weak, distant and incapable. The rottenness of steel districts\r\nprecluded all thought of relief through political channels. The\r\nemployers seemed omnipotent. But the strike has changed all this. Like\r\na flash the unions appeared upon the scene. They flourished and expanded\r\nin spite of all opposition. Then boldly they went to a death grapple\r\nwith the erstwhile unchallenged employers. It is true they did not win,\r\nbut they put up a fight which has won the steel workers' hearts. Their\r\nearnest struggle and the loyal support, by money and food, which they\r\ngave the strikers, have forever laid at rest the employers' arguments\r\nthat the unions are cowardly, grafting bodies organized merely to rob\r\nand betray the workers. Even the densest of the strikers could see that\r\nthe loss of the strike was due to insufficient preparation; that only a\r\nfraction of the power of unionism had been developed and that with\r\nbetter organization better results would be secured. And the outcome is\r\nthat the steel workers have won a precious belief in the power of\r\nconcerted action through the unions. They have discovered the Achilles'\r\nheel of their would-be masters. They now see the way out of their\r\nslavery. This is their tremendous victory.\r\n\r\nNo less than the steel workers themselves, the whole trade-union\r\nmovement won a great moral victory in the steel strike and the campaign\r\nthat preceded it. This more than offsets the failure of the strike\r\nitself. The gain consists of a badly needed addition to the unions' thin\r\nstore of self-confidence. To trade-union organizers the steel industry\r\nhad long symbolized the impossible. Wave after wave of organizing effort\r\nthey had sent against it; but their work had been as ineffectual as a\r\nsummer sea lapping the base of Gibraltar. Pessimism regarding its\r\nconquest for trade unionism was abysmal. But now all this is changed.\r\nThe impossible has been accomplished. The steel workers were organized\r\nin the face of all that the steel companies could do to prevent it. Thus\r\na whole new vista of possibilities unfolds before the unions. Not only\r\ndoes the reorganization of the steel industry seem strictly feasible,\r\nbut the whole conception that many of the basic industries are immune to\r\ntrade unionism turns out to be an illusion. If the steel industry could\r\nbe organized, so can any other in the country; for the worst of them\r\npresents hardly a fraction of the difficulties squarely vanquished in\r\nthe steel industry. The mouth has been shut forever of that insufferable\r\npest of the labor movement, the large body of ignorant, incompetent,\r\nshort-sighted, visionless union men whose eternal song, when some\r\nimportant organizing project is afoot, is \"It can't be done.\" After this\r\nexperience in the steel industry the problem of unionizing any industry\r\nresolves itself simply into selecting a capable organizer and giving him\r\nsufficient money and men to do the job.\r\n\r\nThe ending of the strike by no means indicates the abandonment of the\r\nsteel workers' battle for their rights. For a while, perhaps, their\r\nadvance may be checked, while they are recovering from the effects of\r\ntheir great struggle. But it will not be long before they have another\r\nbig movement under way. They feel but little defeated by the loss of the\r\nstrike, and the trade unions as a whole feel even less so. Both have\r\ngained wonderful confidence in themselves and in each other during the\r\nfight. The unions will not desert the field and leave the workers a\r\nprey to the demoralizing propaganda of the employers, customary after\r\nlost strikes. On the contrary they are keeping a large crew of\r\norganizers at work in an educational campaign, devised to maintain and\r\ndevelop the confidence the steel workers have in themselves and the\r\nunions. Then, when the opportune time comes, which will be but shortly,\r\nthe next big drive will be on. Mr. Gary and his associates may attempt\r\nto forestall the inevitable by the granting of fake eight hour days,\r\npaper increases in wages and hand-picked company unions, but it is safe\r\nto say that the steel workers will go on building up stronger and more\r\naggressive combinations among themselves and with allied trades until\r\nthey finally achieve industrial freedom. So long as any men undertake to\r\noppress the steel workers and to squeeze returns from the industry\r\nwithout rendering adequate service therefor, just that long must these\r\nmen expect to be confronted by a progressively more militant and\r\nrebellious working force. The great steel strike of 1919 will seem only\r\na preliminary skirmish when compared with the tremendous battles that\r\nare bound to come unless the enslaved steel workers are set free.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] Throughout this book the term \"Steel Trust\" is used to indicate the\r\ncollectivity of the great steel companies. It is true that this is in\r\ncontradiction to the common usage, which generally applies the term to\r\nthe United States Steel Corporation alone, but it is in harmony with the\r\nfacts. All the big steel companies act together upon all important\r\nmatters confronting their industry. Beyond question they are organized\r\nmore or less secretly into a trust. This book recognizes this situation,\r\nhence the broad use of the term \"Steel Trust.\" It is important to\r\nremember this explanation. Where the writer has in mind any one company\r\nthat company is named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA GENERATION OF DEFEAT[3]\r\n\r\n    THE URGE FOR MASTERY--DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE--THE HOMESTEAD\r\n      STRIKE--THE STRIKES OF 1901 AND 1909--THE STEEL TRUST\r\n      VICTORIOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent upheaval in the steel industry was but one link in a long\r\nchain of struggles, the latest battle in an industrial war for freedom\r\nwhich has raged almost since the inception of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe steel manufacturers have always aggressively applied the ordinary,\r\nalthough unacknowledged, American business principles that our\r\nindustries exist primarily to create huge profits for the fortunate few\r\nwho own them, and that if they have any other utility it is a matter of\r\nsecondary importance. The interests of society in the steel business\r\nthey scoff at. And as for their own employees, they have never\r\nconsidered them better than so much necessary human machinery, to be\r\nbought in the market at the lowest possible price and otherwise handled\r\nin a thoroughly irresponsible manner. They clearly understand that if\r\nthey are to carry out their policy of raw exploitation, the prime\r\nessential is that they keep their employees unorganized. Then, without\r\nlet or hindrance, wages may be kept low, the work day made longer,\r\nspeeding systems introduced, safety devices neglected, and the human\r\nside of the industry generally robbed and repressed in favor of its\r\nprofit side; whereas, if the unions were allowed to come in, it would\r\nmean that every policy in the industry would first have to be considered\r\nand judged with regard to its effects upon the men actually making steel\r\nand iron. It would mean that humanity must be emphasized at the expense\r\nof misearned dividends. But this would never do. The mill owners are\r\ninterested in profits, not in humanity. Hence, if they can prevent it,\r\nthey will have no unions. Since the pioneer days of steel making their\r\npolicy has tended powerfully on the one hand towards elevating the\r\nemployers into a small group of enormously wealthy, idle, industrial\r\nautocrats, and on the other towards depressing the workers into a huge\r\narmy of ignorant, poverty-stricken, industrial serfs. The calamity of it\r\nis that this policy has worked out so well.\r\n\r\nAgainst this will-to-power of their employers the steel workers have\r\nfought long and valiantly. In the early days of the industry, when the\r\ncombinations of capital were weak, the working force skilled,\r\nEnglish-speaking and independent, the latter easily defended themselves\r\nand made substantial progress toward their own inevitable, even if\r\nunrecognized goal of industrial freedom; but in later years, with the\r\ngrowth of the gigantic United States Steel Corporation, the displacement\r\nof skilled labor by automatic machinery and the introduction of\r\nmultitudes of illiterate immigrants into the industry, their fight for\r\ntheir rights became a desperate and almost hopeless struggle. For the\r\npast thirty years they have suffered an unbroken series of defeats.\r\nTheir one-time growing freedom has been crushed.\r\n\r\nAt first the fight was easy, and by the later '80's, grace to the\r\nactivities of many unions, notable among which were the old Sons of\r\nVulcan, the Knights of Labor and the Amalgamated Association of Iron,\r\nSteel and Tin Workers, considerable organization existed among the men\r\nemployed in the iron and steel mills throughout the country. The\r\nAmalgamated Association, the dominating body, enjoyed great prestige in\r\nthe labor movement generally. It consisted almost entirely of highly\r\nskilled men and paid little or no attention to the unskilled workers. In\r\nthe heyday of its strength, in 1891, it numbered about 24,000 members.\r\nIts stronghold was in the Pittsburgh district. Its citadel was\r\nHomestead. During the period of its greatest activity some measure of\r\ndemocracy prevailed in the industry, and prospects seemed bright for its\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nBut about that time Andrew Carnegie, grown rich and powerful, began to\r\nchafe uneasily under the restrictions placed upon his rapacity by his\r\norganized employees. He wanted a free hand and determined to get it. As\r\nthe first step towards enshackling his workers he brought into his\r\ncompany that inveterate enemy of democracy in all its forms, Henry C.\r\nFrick. Then the two, Carnegie and Frick, neither of whom gave his\r\nworkers as much consideration as the Southern slave holder gave his\r\nbondmen--for chattel slaves were at least assured sufficient food, warm\r\nclothes, a habitable home and medical attendance--began to war upon the\r\nunion. They started the trouble in Homestead, where the big mills of the\r\nCarnegie Company are located. In 1889 they insisted that the men accept\r\nheavy reductions in wages, write their agreements to expire in the\r\nunfavorable winter season instead of in summer, and give up their union.\r\nThe men refused, and after a short strike, got a favorable settlement.\r\nBut Carnegie and Frick were not to be lightly turned from their purpose.\r\nWhen the contract in force expired, they renewed their old demands, and\r\nthus precipitated the great Homestead strike.\r\n\r\nThis famous strike attracted world-wide attention, and well it might,\r\nfor it marked a turning point in the industrial history of America. It\r\nbegan on June 23, 1892, and lasted until November 20 of the same year.\r\nCharacterized by extreme bitterness and violence, it resulted in\r\ncomplete defeat for the men, not only in Homestead, but also in several\r\nother big mills in Pittsburgh and adjoining towns where the steel\r\nworkers had struck in support of their besieged brothers in Homestead.\r\nThis unsuccessful strike eliminated organized labor from the mills of\r\nthe big Carnegie Company. It also dealt the Amalgamated Association of\r\nIron, Steel and Tin Workers a blow from which it has not yet recovered.\r\nIt ended the period of trade-union expansion in the steel industry and\r\nbegan an era of unrestricted labor control by the employers. At\r\nHomestead Carnegie and Frick stuck a knife deep into the vitals of the\r\nyoung democracy of the steel workers.\r\n\r\nRecuperating somewhat from the staggering defeat at Homestead, the\r\nAmalgamated Association managed to retain a firm hold in the industry\r\nfor a few years longer. Its next big setback, in 1901, was caused by the\r\norganization of the United States Steel Corporation. Foreseeing war from\r\nthis monster combination dominated by the hostile Carnegie interests,\r\nthe union, presided over at that time by Theodore J. Shaffer, decided to\r\ntake time by the forelock and negotiate an agreement that would extend\r\nits scope and give it a chance to live. But the plan failed; the\r\nanti-union tendencies of the employers were too strong, and a strike\r\nresulted. At first the only companies affected were the American Tin\r\nPlate Company, the American Sheet Steel Company and the American Steel\r\nHoop Company. Finally, however, all the organized men in all the mills\r\nof the United States Steel Corporation were called out, but to no avail;\r\nafter a few weeks' struggle the strike was utterly lost.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the 1901 strike broke the backbone of the Amalgamated\r\nAssociation. Still, with characteristic trade-union tenacity, it\r\nlingered along in a few of the Trust plants in the sheet and tin section\r\nof the industry. Its business relations with the companies at this stage\r\nof its decline, according to the testimony of its present President, M.\r\nF. Tighe, before the Senate Committee investigating the 1919 strike,\r\nconsisted of \"giving way to every request that was made by the companies\r\nwhen they insisted upon it.\" But even this humble and pliant attitude of\r\nthe once powerful Amalgamated Association was intolerable to the haughty\r\nsteel kings. They could not brook even the most shadowy opposition to\r\ntheir industrial absolutism. Accordingly, early in the summer of 1909,\r\nthey served notice upon the union men to accept a reduction in wages and\r\ngive up their union. It was practically the same ultimatum delivered by\r\nCarnegie and Frick to the Homestead men twenty years before. With a last\r\ndesperate rally the union met this latest attack upon its life. The\r\nensuing strike lasted fourteen months. It was bitterly fought, but it\r\nwent the way of all strikes in the steel industry since 1892. It was\r\nlost; and in consequence every trace of unionism was wiped out of the\r\nmills not only of the United States Steel Corporation, but of the big\r\nindependent companies as well.\r\n\r\nAlthough the union was not finally crushed in the mills until the strike\r\nof 1909, the steel mill owners were for many years previous to that time\r\nin almost undisputed control of the situation. During a generation,\r\npractically, they have worked their will unhampered; and the results of\r\ntheir policy of unlimited exploitation are all too apparent. For\r\nthemselves they have taken untold millions of wealth from the industry;\r\nfor the workers they have left barely enough to eke out an existence in\r\nthe miserable, degraded steel towns.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the World war the steel workers generally, with the\r\nexception of the laborers, who had secured a cent or two advance per\r\nhour, were making less wages than before the Homestead strike. The\r\nconstant increase in the cost of living in the intervening years had\r\nstill further depressed their standards of life. Not a shred of benefit\r\nhad they received from the tremendously increased output of the\r\nindustry. While the employers lived in gorgeous palaces, the workers\r\nfound themselves, for the most part, crowded like cattle into the filthy\r\nhovels that ordinarily constitute the greater part of the steel towns.\r\nTuberculosis ran riot among them; infant mortality was far above normal.\r\nThough several increases in wages were granted after the war began,\r\nthese have been offset by the terrific rise in the cost of living. If\r\nthe war has brought any betterment in the living conditions of the steel\r\nworkers, it cannot be seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe twelve hour day prevails for half of the men. One-fourth work seven\r\ndays a week, with a twenty-four hour shift every two weeks. Their lives\r\nare one constant round of toil. They have no family life, no opportunity\r\nfor education or even for recreation; for their few hours of liberty are\r\nspoiled by the ever-present fatigue. Furthermore, working conditions in\r\nthe mills are bad. The men are speeded up to such a degree that only the\r\nyoungest and strongest can stand it. At forty the average steel worker\r\nis played out. The work, in itself extremely dangerous, is made still\r\nmore so by the employers' failure to adopt the necessary safety devices.\r\nMany a man has gone to his death through the wanton neglect of the\r\ncompanies to provide safeguarding appliances that they would have been\r\ncompelled to install were the unions still in the plants.[4] Not a\r\ntrace of industrial justice remains. The treatment of the men depends\r\naltogether upon the arbitrary wills of the foremen and superintendents.\r\nA man may give faithful service in a plant for thirty years and then be\r\ndischarged offhand, as many are, for some insignificant cause. He has no\r\none to appeal to. His fellow workers, living in constant terror of\r\ndischarge and the blacklist, dare not even listen to him, much less\r\ndefend his cause. He must bow to the inevitable, even though it means\r\nindustrial ruin for him and his family.\r\n\r\nSuch deplorable conditions result naturally from a lack of unionism. It\r\nis expecting too much of human nature at this stage of its development\r\nto count on employers treating their employees fairly without some form\r\nof compulsion. Even in highly organized industries the unions have to be\r\nconstantly on guard to resist the never-ending encroachments of their\r\nemployers, manifested at every conceivable point of attack. For the\r\nworkers, indeed, eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Hence\r\nnothing but degradation for them and autocracy for their employers may\r\nbe looked for in industries where they are systematically kept\r\nunorganized and thus incapable of defending their rights, as is the case\r\nin the steel industry. This system of industrial serfdom has served the\r\nsteel barons well for a generation. But it is one the steel workers will\r\nnever accept. Regardless of the cost they will rebel against it at every\r\nopportunity till they finally destroy it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Students desiring a full account of the early struggles of the steel\r\nunions are advised to read Mr. John A. Fitch's splendid book, \"The Steel\r\nWorkers.\"\r\n\r\n[4] The practice of the different steel companies varies with respect to\r\nsafety devices. Some of them are still in the dark ages that all were in\r\na few years ago, with reckless disregard of human life. Others have made\r\nsome progress. Of these the U. S. Steel Corporation is undoubtedly in\r\nthe lead, for it has installed many safety appliances and has safety\r\ncommittees actively at work. At best, however, steel making is an\r\nexceedingly dangerous industry and the risk is intensified by the great\r\nheat of the mills and the long hours of work--the twelve hour day and\r\nthe seven day week--which lead inevitably to exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT LABOR AWAKES\r\n\r\n    A BLEAK PROSPECT--HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL--A GOLDEN CHANCE\r\n      --DISASTROUS DELAY--THE NEW PLAN--A LOST OPPORTUNITY--THE\r\n      CAMPAIGN BEGINS--GARY FIGHTS BACK\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom just previous to, until some time after the beginning of the world\r\nwar the situation in the steel industry, from a trade-union point of\r\nview, was truly discouraging. It seemed impossible for the workers to\r\naccomplish anything by organized effort. The big steel companies, by\r\ndriving the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers from\r\nthe mills, had built up a terrific reputation as union crushers. This\r\nwas greatly enhanced by their complete defeat of Labor in the memorable\r\nstrikes of the structural iron workers, the lake sailors, the iron\r\nminers, and the steel workers at McKees Rocks in 1909, Bethlehem in 1910\r\nand Youngstown in 1915-16. It was still further enhanced by their\r\nblocking every attempt of the individual trades to re-establish\r\nthemselves, and by the failure of the A. F. of L. steel campaign,\r\ninaugurated by the convention of 1909, to achieve even the slightest\r\ntangible results. The endless round of defeat had reduced almost to zero\r\nthe trade unions' confidence in their ability to cope with the militant\r\nand rapacious steel manufacturers.\r\n\r\nBut as the war wore on and the United States joined the general\r\nslaughter, the situation changed rapidly in favor of the unions. The\r\ndemand for soldiers and munitions had made labor scarce; the Federal\r\nadministration was friendly; the right to organize was freely conceded\r\nby the government and even insisted upon; the steel industry was the\r\nmaster-clock of the whole war program and had to be kept in operation at\r\nall costs; the workers were taking new heart and making demands--already\r\nthey had engaged in big strike movements in the mills in Pittsburgh\r\n(Jones and Laughlin Company), Bethlehem and Birmingham (U. S. Steel).\r\nThe gods were indeed fighting on the side of Labor. It was an\r\nopportunity to organize the industry such as might never again occur.\r\nThat the trade union movement did not embrace it sooner was a calamity.\r\n\r\nThe writer was one of those who perceived the unparalleled opportunity.\r\nBut being at that time Secretary-Treasurer of the committee organizing\r\nthe packing industry I was unable to do anything substantial in the\r\nsteel situation until the handing down of Judge Alschuler's decision\r\ngiving the packing house workers the eight hour day and other vital\r\nconcessions enabled me to slacken my efforts in that important movement.\r\nImmediately thereafter, on April 7, 1918, I presented a resolution to\r\nthe Chicago Federation of Labor requesting the executive officers of the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor to call a general labor conference and to\r\ninaugurate thereat a national campaign to organize the steel workers.\r\nThe resolution was endorsed by twelve local unions in the steel\r\nindustry. It was adopted unanimously and forwarded to the A. F. of L.\r\nThe latter took the matter up with the rapidly reviving Amalgamated\r\nAssociation, and the affair was slowly winding along to an eventual\r\nconference, with a loss of much precious time, when the resolution was\r\nresubmitted to the Chicago Federation of Labor, re-adopted and sent to\r\nthe St. Paul convention of the A. F. of L., June 10-20, 1918. It\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION #29\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, the organization of the vast armies of\r\n      wage-earners employed in the steel industries is vitally\r\n      necessary to the further spread of industrial democracy in\r\n      America, and\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, Organized Labor can accomplish this great\r\n      task only by putting forth a tremendous effort; therefore,\r\n      be it\r\n\r\n      RESOLVED, that the executive officers of the A. F.\r\n      of L. stand instructed to call a conference during this\r\n      convention of delegates of all international unions whose\r\n      interests are involved in the steel industries, and of all\r\n      the State Federations and City Central bodies in the steel\r\n      districts, for the purpose of uniting all these\r\n      organizations into one mighty drive to organize the steel\r\n      plants of America.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted by unanimous vote. Accordingly, a number of\r\nconferences were held during the convention, at which the proposed\r\ncampaign was discussed and endorsed. The outcome was that provisions\r\nwere made to have President Gompers call another conference, in Chicago\r\nthirty days later, of responsible union officials who would come\r\nprepared to act in the name of their international unions. This involved\r\nfurther waste of probably the most precious time for organizing work\r\nthat Labor will ever have.\r\n\r\nFrom past events in the steel industry it was evident that in the\r\nproposed campaign radical departures would have to be made from the\r\nordinary organizing tactics. Without question the steel workers' unions\r\nhave always lacked efficiency in their organizing departments. This was\r\na cardinal failing of the Amalgamated Association and it contributed as\r\nmuch, if not more than anything else to its downfall. If, when in its\r\nprime, this organization had shown sufficient organizing activity in the\r\nnon-union mills, and especially by taking in the unskilled, it would\r\nhave so intrenched itself that Carnegie and his henchman, Frick, never\r\ncould have dislodged it. But, unfortunately, it undertook too much of\r\nits organization work at the conference table and not enough at the mill\r\ngates. Consequently, more than once it found itself in deadly quarrels\r\nwith the employers over the unionization of certain mills, when a live\r\norganizer working among the non-union men involved would have solved the\r\nproblem in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nNor had the other unions claiming jurisdiction over men employed in the\r\nsteel industry developed an organizing policy equal to the occasion.\r\nTheir system of nibbling away, one craft at a time in individual mills,\r\nwas entirely out of place. Possibly effective in some industries, it was\r\nworse than useless in the steel mills. Its unvarying failure served only\r\nto strengthen the mill owners and to further discourage the mill\r\nworkers and Organized Labor. It is pure folly to organize one trade in\r\none mill, or all trades in one mill, or even all trades in all the mills\r\nin one locality, when, at any time it sees fit to do so, the Steel Trust\r\ncan defeat the movement by merely shutting down its mills in the\r\naffected district and transferring its work elsewhere, as it has done\r\ntime and again. It was plain, therefore, that the proposed campaign\r\nwould have to affect all the steel mills simultaneously. It would have\r\nto be national in scope and encompass every worker in every mill, in\r\nevery steel district in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe intention was to use the system so strikingly successful in the\r\norganization of the packing industry. The committee charged with\r\norganizing that industry, when it assembled, a year before, to begin the\r\nwork, found three possible methods of procedure confronting it, each\r\nwith its advocates present. It could go along on the old, discredited\r\ncraft policy of each trade for itself and the devil take the hindmost;\r\nit might attempt to form an industrial union; or it could apply the\r\nprinciple of federating the trades, then making great headway on the\r\nrailroads. The latter system was the one chosen as the best fitted to\r\nget results at this stage in the development of the unions and the\r\npacking industry. And the outcome proved the wisdom of the decision. In\r\nthe steel campaign the unions were to be similarly linked together in an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance.\r\n\r\nBut all this relates merely to the shell of the plan behind Resolution\r\nNo. 29. Its breath of life was in its strategy; in the way the\r\norganization work was to be prosecuted. The best plans are worthless\r\nunless properly executed. The idea was to make a hurricane drive\r\nsimultaneously in all the steel centers that would catch the workers'\r\nimagination and sweep them into the unions _en masse_ despite all\r\nopposition, and thus to put Mr. Gary and his associates into such a\r\npredicament that they would have to grant the just demands of their men.\r\nIt was intended that after the Chicago conference a dozen or more\r\ngeneral organizers should be dispatched immediately to the most\r\nimportant steel centers, to bring to the steel workers the first word of\r\nthe big drive being made in their behalf, and to organize local\r\ncommittees to handle the detail work of organization. In the meantime\r\nthe co-operating international unions were to recruit numbers of\r\norganizers and to send them to join the forces already being developed\r\neverywhere by the general organizers. They should also assemble and pay\r\nin as quickly as possible their respective portions of the fund of at\r\nleast $250,000 to be provided for the work. The essence of the plan was\r\nquick, energetic action.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three or four weeks, when the organizing forces were in\r\ngood shape and the workers in the mills acquainted with what was afoot,\r\nthe campaign would be opened with a rush. Great mass meetings, built up\r\nby extensive advertising, would be held everywhere at the same time\r\nthroughout the steel industry. These were calculated to arouse hope and\r\nenthusiasm among the workers and to bring thousands of them into the\r\nunions, regardless of any steps the mill owners might take to prevent\r\nit. After two or three meetings in each place, the heavy stream of men\r\npouring into the unions would be turned into a decisive flood by the\r\nelection of committees to formulate the grievances of the men and\r\npresent these to the employers. The war was on; the continued operation\r\nof the steel industry was imperative; a strike was therefore out of the\r\nquestion; the steel manufacturers would have been compelled to yield to\r\ntheir workers, either directly or through the instrumentality of the\r\nGovernment. The trade unions would have been re-established in the steel\r\nindustry, and along with them fair dealing and the beginnings of\r\nindustrial democracy.\r\n\r\nThe plan was not only a bold one, but also under the circumstances the\r\nlogical and practical one. The course of events proved its feasibility.\r\nThe contention that it involved taking unfair advantage of the steel\r\nmanufacturers may be dismissed as inconsequential. These gentlemen in\r\ntheir dealings with those who stand in their way do not even know the\r\nmeaning of the word fairness. Their workers they shoot and starve into\r\nsubmission; their competitors they industrially strangle without\r\nceremony; the public and the Government they exploit without stint or\r\nlimit. The year before the campaign began, 1917, when the country was\r\nstraining every nerve to develop and conserve its resources, the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation alone, not to mention the many independents,\r\nafter paying federal taxes and leaving out of account the vast sums that\r\ndisappeared in the obscure and mysterious company funds, unblushingly\r\npocketed the fabulous profit of $253,608,200.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to be seen how far the unions would sustain such a\r\ngeneral and energetic campaign. The fateful conference met in the New\r\nMorrison Hotel, Chicago, August 1-2, 1918. Samuel Gompers presided over\r\nits sessions. Representatives of fifteen international unions were\r\npresent. These men showed their progressive spirit by meeting many\r\ndifficult issues squarely with the proper solutions. They realized fully\r\nthe need of co-operation along industrial lines, from the men who dig\r\nthe coal and iron ore to those who switch the finished products onto the\r\nmain lines of the railroads. Plainly no trade felt able to cope\r\nsingle-handed with the Steel Trust; and joint action was decided upon\r\nalmost without discussion. Likewise the conference saw the folly of\r\ntrying to organize the steel industry with each of the score of unions\r\ndemanding a different initiation fee. Therefore, after much stretching\r\nof constitutions, the international unions, with the exception of the\r\nBricklayers, Molders and Patternmakers (who charged respectively $7.25,\r\n$5.00 and $5.00), agreed to a uniform initiation fee of three dollars,\r\none dollar of which was to be used for defraying expenses of the\r\nnational organization work.\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel\r\nWorkers was formed. It was made to consist of one representative from\r\neach of the co-operating international unions. Its given function was to\r\nsuperintend the work of organization. Its chairman had to be a\r\nrepresentative of the A. F. of L. Mr. Gompers volunteered to fill this\r\nposition; the writer was elected Secretary-Treasurer. Including later\r\nadditions, the constituent unions were as follows:\r\n\r\n  International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop-Forgers\r\n  and Helpers\r\n\r\n  Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Iron Ship Builders\r\n  and Helpers of America\r\n\r\n  United Brick and Clay Workers\r\n\r\n  Bricklayers', Masons' and Plasterers' International\r\n  Union of America\r\n\r\n  International Association of Bridge, Structural and\r\n  Ornamental Iron Workers\r\n\r\n  Coopers' International Union of North America\r\n\r\n  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\r\n\r\n  International Brotherhood of Foundry Employees\r\n\r\n  International Hod Carriers', Building, and Common\r\n  Laborers' Union of America\r\n\r\n  Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin\r\n  Workers\r\n\r\n  International Association of Machinists\r\n\r\n  International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter\r\n  Workers\r\n\r\n  United Mine Workers of America\r\n\r\n  International Molders' Union of North America\r\n\r\n  Patternmakers' League of North America\r\n\r\n  United Association of Plumbers and Steam Fitters\r\n\r\n  Quarry Workers' International Union of North America\r\n\r\n  Brotherhood Railway Carmen of America\r\n\r\n  International Seamen's Union of America\r\n\r\n  Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Alliance\r\n\r\n  International Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen and\r\n  Oilers\r\n\r\n  International Union of Steam and Operating Engineers\r\n\r\n  International Brotherhood of Steamshovel and Dredgemen\r\n\r\n  Switchmen's Union of North America.\r\n\r\nThis group of unions, lined up to do battle with the Steel Trust,\r\nrepresents the largest body of workers ever engaged in a joint movement\r\nin any country. Their members number approximately 2,000,000, and\r\ncomprise about one-half of the entire American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. The conference had removed the barriers in the way of\r\nthe campaign. But when it came to providing the large sums of money and\r\nthe numerous crews of organizers that were immediately and imperatively\r\nneeded to insure success, it failed dismally. The internationals\r\nassessed themselves only $100 apiece; they furnished only a corporal's\r\nguard of organizers to go ahead with the work; and future reinforcements\r\nlooked remote.\r\n\r\nThis was a facer. The original plan of a dashing offensive went to smash\r\ninstanter, and with it, likewise, the opportunity to organize the steel\r\nindustry. The slender resources in hand at once made necessary a\r\ncomplete change of strategy. To undertake a national movement was out of\r\nthe question. The work had to be confined to the Chicago district. This\r\nwas admittedly going according to wrong principles. The steel industry\r\nis national in scope and should be handled as such. To operate in one\r\ndistrict alone would expose that district to attacks, waste invaluable\r\ntime and give the employers a chance to adopt counter measures against\r\nthe whole campaign. It meant playing squarely into Mr. Gary's hands. But\r\nthere was no other way out of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe writer had hoped that the favorable industrial situation and the\r\norganization of the packing industry, which had long been considered\r\nhopeless, would have heartened the trade-union movement sufficiently for\r\nit to attack the steel problem with the required vigor and confidence.\r\nBut such was not the case. The tradition of defeat in the steel industry\r\nwas too strong,--thirty years of failure were not so easily forgotten.\r\nLack of faith in themselves prevented the unions from pouring their\r\nresources into the campaign in its early, critical days. The work in the\r\nChicago district was undertaken, nevertheless, with a determination to\r\nwin the hearty support of Labor by giving an actual demonstration of the\r\norganizability of the steel workers.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of September the drive for members was opened in\r\nthe Chicago district. Monster meetings were held in South Chicago, Gary,\r\nIndiana Harbor and Joliet--all the points that the few organizers could\r\ncover. The inevitable happened; eager for a chance to right their\r\nwrongs, the steel workers stormed into the unions. In Gary 749 joined at\r\nthe first meeting, Joliet enrolled 500, and other places did almost as\r\nwell. It was a stampede--exactly what was counted upon by the movers of\r\nResolution #29. And it could just as well have been on a national scale,\r\nhad the international unions possessed sufficient self-confidence and\r\ngiven enough men and money to put the original plan into execution. In a\r\nfew weeks the unions would have been everywhere firmly intrenched; and\r\nin a few more the entire steel industry would have been captured for\r\ntrade unionism and justice.\r\n\r\nBut now the folly of a one-district movement made itself evident. Up to\r\nthis time the steel barons, like many union leaders, apparently had\r\nviewed the campaign with a skeptical, \"It can't be done\" air. But\r\nevents in Gary and elsewhere quickly dissipated their optimism. The\r\nmovement was clearly dangerous and required heroic treatment. The\r\nemployers, therefore, applying Mr. Gary's famous \"Give them an extra cup\r\nof rice\" policy, ordered the basic eight hour day to go into effect on\r\nthe first of October. This meant that the steel workers were to get\r\nthereafter time and one half after eight hours, instead of straight\r\ntime. It amounted to an increase of two hours pay per day but the actual\r\nworking hours were not changed. It was a counter stroke which the\r\nnational movement had been designed to forestall.\r\n\r\nAlthough this concession really spelled a great moral victory for the\r\nunions its practical effect was bad. Just a few months before the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation had publicly announced that, come what might,\r\nthere would be no basic eight hour day in the steel industry. Its sudden\r\nadoption, almost over night, therefore, was a testimonial to the power\r\nof the unions. But this the steel workers as a whole could not realize.\r\nIn the Chicago district, where the campaign was on, they understood and\r\ngave the unions credit for the winning; but in other districts, where\r\nnothing had been done, naturally they believed it a gift from the\r\ncompanies. Had the work been going on everywhere when Mr. Gary attempted\r\nthis move, the workers would have understood his motives and joined the\r\nunions _en masse_,--the unions would have won hands down. But with\r\noperations confined to one district he was able to steal the credit from\r\nthe unions, partially satisfy his men, and strip the campaign of one of\r\nits principal issues. No doubt he thought he had dealt it a mortal\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nFLANK ATTACKS\r\n\r\n    A SEA OF TROUBLES--THE POLICY OF ENCIRCLEMENT--TAKING THE\r\n      OUTPOSTS--ORGANIZING METHODS--FINANCIAL SYSTEMS--THE\r\n      QUESTION OF MORALE--JOHNSTOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nPittsburgh is the heart of America's steel industry. Its pre-eminence\r\nderives from its splendid location for steel making. It is situated at\r\nthe point where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers join their murky\r\nwaters to form the Ohio, this providing excellent water transportation.\r\nImmense deposits of coal surround it; the Great Lakes, the gateway to\r\nMinnesota's iron ore, are in easy reach; highly developed railway\r\nfacilities make the best markets convenient. In the city itself there\r\nare only a few of the larger steel mills; but at short distances along\r\nthe banks of its three rivers, are many big steel producing centers,\r\nincluding Homestead, Braddock, Rankin, McKeesport, McKees Rocks,\r\nDuquesne, Clairton, Woodlawn, Donora, Midland, Vandergrift,\r\nBrackenridge, New Kensington, etc. Within a radius of seventy-five miles\r\nlie Johnstown, Youngstown, Butler, Farrell, Sharon, New Castle,\r\nWheeling, Mingo, Steubenville, Bellaire, Wierton and various other\r\nimportant steel towns. The district contains from seventy to eighty per\r\ncent. of the country's steel industry. The whole territory is an amazing\r\nand bewildering network of gigantic steel mills, blast furnaces and\r\nfabricating shops.\r\n\r\nIt was into this industrial labyrinth, the den of the Steel Trust, that\r\nthe National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers moved its\r\noffice on October 1, 1918, preparatory to beginning its work. Success in\r\nthe Chicago district had made it imperative to overcome the original\r\ntactical blunder by extending the campaign, just as quickly as possible,\r\nto a national scope.\r\n\r\nThe outlook was most unpromising. Even under the best of circumstances\r\nthe task of getting the enormous army of steel workers to thinking and\r\nacting together in terms of trade unionism would be tremendous. But the\r\ndisastrous mistake of not starting the campaign soon enough and with the\r\nproper vigor multiplied the difficulties. Unfavorable winter weather was\r\napproaching. This was complicated by the influenza epidemic, which for\r\nseveral weeks suspended all public gatherings. Then came the end of the\r\nwar. The workers had also just been given the basic eight hour day. All\r\nthese things tended to still them somewhat and to weaken their interest\r\nin organization. What was left of this interest was almost entirely\r\nwiped out when the mills, dependent as they were on war work, began to\r\nslacken production. The workers became obsessed with a fear of hard\r\ntimes, a timidity which was intensified by the steel companies'\r\ndischarging every one suspected of union affiliations or sympathies.\r\nAnd to cap the climax, the resources of the National Committee were\r\nstill pitifully inadequate to the great task confronting it.\r\n\r\nBut worst of all, the steel companies were now on the _qui vive_. The\r\noriginal plan had been conceived to take them by surprise, on the\r\nsupposition that their supreme contempt for Labor and their conceit in\r\ntheir own power would blind them to the real force and extent of the\r\nmovement until it was too late to take effective counteraction. And it\r\nwould surely have worked out this way, had the program been followed.\r\nBut now the advantage of surprise, vital in all wars, industrial or\r\nmilitary, was lost to the unions. Wide awake and alarmed, the Steel\r\nTrust was prepared to fight to the last ditch.\r\n\r\nThings looked desperate. But there was no other course than to go ahead\r\nregardless of obstacles. The word failure was eliminated from the\r\nvocabulary of the National Committee. Preparations were made to begin\r\noperations in the towns close to Pittsburgh. But the Steel Trust was\r\nvigilant. It no longer placed any reliance upon its usual methods--its\r\nwelfare, old age pension, employees' stockholding, wholesale discharge,\r\nor \"extra cup of rice\" policies--to hold its men in line, when a good\r\nfighting chance to win their rights presented itself to them. It had\r\ngained a wholesome respect for the movement and was taking no chances.\r\nIt would cut off all communication between the organizers and the men.\r\nConsequently, its lackey-like mayors and burgesses in the threatened\r\ntowns immediately held a meeting and decided that there would be no\r\nassemblages of steel workers in the Monongahela valley. In some places\r\nthese officials, who for the most part are steel company employees, had\r\nthe pliable local councils hurriedly adopt ordinances making it unlawful\r\nto hold public meetings without securing sanction; in other places they\r\nadopted the equally effective method of simply notifying the landlords\r\nthat if they dared rent their halls to the American Federation of Labor\r\nthey would have their \"Sunday Club\" privileges stopped. In both cases\r\nthe effect was the same--no meetings could be held. In the immediate\r\nPittsburgh district there had been little enough free speech and free\r\nassembly for the trade unions before. Now it was abolished altogether.\r\n\r\nAt this time the world war was still on; our soldiers were fighting in\r\nEurope to \"make the world safe for democracy\"; President Wilson was\r\nidealistically declaiming about \"the new freedom\"; while right here in\r\nour own country the trade unions, with 500,000 men in the service, were\r\nnot even allowed to hold public meetings. It was a worse condition than\r\nkaiserism itself had ever set up. This is said advisedly, for the German\r\nworkers were at least permitted to meet when and where they pleased. The\r\nworst they had to contend with was a policeman on their platform, who\r\nwould jot down \"seditious\" remarks and require the offenders to report\r\nnext day to the police. I remember with what scorn I watched this system\r\nin Germany years ago, and how proud I felt to be an American. I was so\r\nsure that freedom of speech and assembly were fundamental institutions\r\nwith us and that we would never tolerate such imposition. But now I have\r\nchanged my mind. In Pennsylvania, not to speak of other states, the\r\nworkers enjoy few or no more rights than prevailed under the czars. They\r\ncannot hold meetings at all. So far are they below the status of pre-war\r\nGermans in this respect that the comparative freedom of the latter seems\r\nalmost like an unattainable ideal. And this deprival of rights is done\r\nin the name of law and patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such suppression of constitutional rights and in the face\r\nof all the other staggering difficulties it was clearly impossible for\r\nour scanty forces to capture Pittsburgh for unionism by a frontal\r\nattack. Therefore a system of flank attacks was decided upon. This\r\nresolved itself into a plan literally to surround the immediate\r\nPittsburgh district with organized posts before attacking it. The\r\noutlying steel districts that dot the counties and states around\r\nPittsburgh like minor forts about a great stronghold, were first to be\r\nwon. Then the unions, with the added strength, were to make a big drive\r\non the citadel.\r\n\r\nIt was a far-fetched program when compared with the original; but\r\ncircumstances compelled it. An important consideration in its execution\r\nwas that it must not seem that the unions were abandoning Pittsburgh.\r\nThat was the center of the battle line; the unions had attacked there,\r\nand now they must at least pretend to hold their ground until they were\r\nable to begin the real attack. The morale of the organizing force and\r\nthe steel workers demanded this. So, all winter long mass meetings were\r\nheld in the Pittsburgh Labor Temple and hundreds of thousands of\r\nleaflets were distributed in the neighboring mills to prepare the\r\nground for unionization in the spring. Besides, a lot of noise was made\r\nover the suppression of free speech and free assemblage. Protest\r\nmeetings were held, committees appointed, investigations set afoot,\r\npoliticians visited, and much other more or less useless, although\r\nspectacular, running around engaged in. These activities did not cost\r\nmuch, and they camouflaged well the union program.\r\n\r\nBut the actual fight was elsewhere. During the next several months the\r\nNational Committee, with gradually increasing resources, set up\r\nsubstantial organizations in steel towns all over the country except\r\nclose in to Pittsburgh, including Youngstown, East Youngstown, Warren,\r\nNiles, Canton, Struthers, Hubbard, Massillon, Alliance, New\r\nPhiladelphia, Sharon, Farrell, New Castle, Butler, Ellwood City, New\r\nKensington, Leechburg, Apollo, Vandergrift, Brackenridge, Johnstown,\r\nCoatesville, Wheeling, Benwood, Bellaire, Steubenville, Mingo,\r\nCleveland, Buffalo, Lackawanna, Pueblo, Birmingham, etc. Operations in\r\nthe Chicago district were intensified and extended to take in Milwaukee,\r\nKenosha, Waukegan, De Kalb, Peoria, Pullman, Hammond, East Chicago,\r\netc., while in Bethlehem the National Committee amplified the work\r\nstarted a year before by the Machinists and Electrical Workers.\r\n\r\nMuch of the success in these localities was due to the thoroughly\r\nsystematic way in which the organizing work was carried on. This merits\r\na brief description. There were two classes of organizers in the\r\ncampaign, the floating and the stationary. Outside of a few traveling\r\nforeign speakers, the floating organizers were those sent in by the\r\nvarious international unions. They usually went about from point to\r\npoint attending to their respective sections of the newly formed local\r\nunions, and giving such assistance to the general campaign as their\r\nother duties permitted. The stationary organizers consisted of A. F. of\r\nL. men, representatives of the United Mine Workers, and men hired\r\ndirectly by the National Committee. They acted as local organizing\r\nsecretaries, and were the backbone of the working force. The floating\r\norganizers were controlled mostly by their international unions; the\r\nstationary organizers worked wholly under the direction of the National\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the organizing system used was the same. The local secretary\r\nwas in full charge. He had an office, which served as general\r\nheadquarters. He circulated the National Committee's weekly bulletin,\r\nconsisting of a short, trenchant trade-union argument in four languages.\r\nHe built up the mass meetings, and controlled all applications for\r\nmembership. At these mass meetings and in the offices all trades were\r\nsigned up indiscriminately upon a uniform blank. But there was no \"one\r\nbig union\" formed. The signed applications were merely stacked away\r\nuntil there was a considerable number. Then the representatives of all\r\nthe trades were assembled and the applications distributed among them.\r\nLater these men set up their respective unions. Finally, the new unions\r\nwere drawn up locally into informal central bodies, known as Iron and\r\nSteel Workers' councils. These were invaluable as they knit the movement\r\ntogether and strengthened the weaker unions. They also inculcated the\r\nindispensable conception of solidarity along industrial lines and\r\nprevented irresponsible strike action by over-zealous single trades.\r\n\r\nA highly important feature was the financial system. The handling of the\r\nfunds is always a danger point in all working class movements. More than\r\none strike and organizing campaign has been wrecked by loose money\r\nmethods. The National Committee spared no pains to avoid this menace.\r\nThe problem was an immense one, for there were from 100 to 125\r\norganizers (which was what the crew finally amounted to) signing up\r\nsteel workers by the thousands all over the country; but it was solved\r\nby the strict application of a few business principles. In the first\r\nplace the local secretaries were definitely recognized as the men in\r\ncharge and placed under heavy bonds. All the application blanks used by\r\nthem were numbered serially. They alone were authorized to sign\r\nreceipts[5] for initiation fees received. Should other organizers wish\r\nto enroll members, as often happened at the monster mass meetings, they\r\nwere given and charged with so many receipts duly signed by the\r\nsecretaries. Later on they were required to return these receipts or\r\nthree dollars apiece for them. The effect of all this was to make one\r\nman, and him bonded, responsible in each locality for all paper\r\noutstanding against the National Committee. This was absolutely\r\nessential. No system was possible without this foundation.\r\n\r\nThe next step was definitely to fasten responsibility in the transfer of\r\ninitiation fees from the local secretaries to the representatives of the\r\nvarious trade unions. To do so was most important. It was accomplished\r\nby requiring the local secretaries to exact from these men detailed\r\nreceipts, specifying not only the amounts paid and the number of\r\napplications turned over, but also the serial number of each\r\napplication. Bulk transfer of applications was prohibited, there being\r\nno way to identify the paper so handled.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of these regulations was to enable the National\r\nCommittee almost instantly to trace any one of the thousands of\r\napplications continually passing through the hands of its agents. For\r\ninstance, a steel worker who had joined at an office or a mass meeting,\r\nhearing later of the formation of his local union, would go to its\r\nmeeting, present his receipt and ask for his union card. The secretary\r\nof the union would look up the applications which had been turned over\r\nto him. If he could not find one to correspond with the man's receipt he\r\nwould take the matter up with the National Committee's local secretary.\r\nThe latter could not deny his own signature on the receipt; he would\r\nhave to tell what became of the application and the fee. On looking up\r\nthe matter he would find that he had turned them over to a certain\r\nrepresentative. Nor could the latter deny his signature on the detailed\r\nreceipt. He would have to make good.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the work, district offices were established in Chicago\r\nand Youngstown. Organizers and secretaries held district meetings\r\nweekly. Local secretaries at points contiguous to these centers reported\r\nto their respective district secretaries. All others dealt directly with\r\nthe general office of the National Committee.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that the co-operating unions, at the August 1-2\r\nconference, agreed that the sum of one dollar should be deducted from\r\neach initiation fee for organization purposes. The collection of this\r\nmoney devolved upon the National Committee and presented considerable\r\ndifficulty. It was solved by a system. The local secretaries, in turning\r\nover to the trades the applications signed up in their offices or at the\r\nmass meetings, held out one dollar apiece on them. For the applications\r\nsecured at the meetings of the local unions they collected the dollars\r\ndue with the assistance of blank forms sent to the unions. Each week the\r\nlocal secretaries sent reports to the general office of the National\r\nCommittee, specifying in detail the number of members enrolled and\r\nturned over to the various trades, and enclosing checks to cover the\r\namounts on hand after local expenses were met. These reports were duly\r\ncertified by the representatives of the organizations involved, who\r\nsigned their names on them at the points where the reports referred to\r\nthe number of members turned over to their respective bodies. The whole\r\nsystem worked well.\r\n\r\nPractical labor officials who have handled mass movements understand the\r\ngreat difficulties attendant upon the organization of large bodies of\r\nworkingmen. In the steel campaign these were more serious than ever\r\nbefore. The tremendous number of men involved; their unfamiliarity with\r\nthe English language and total lack of union experience; the wide scope\r\nof the operations; the complications created by a score of international\r\nunions, each with its own corps of organizers, directly mainly from\r\nfar-distant headquarters; the chronic lack of resources; and the need\r\nfor quick action in the face of incessant attacks from the Steel\r\nTrust--all together produced technical difficulties without precedent.\r\nBut the foregoing systems went far to solve them. And into these systems\r\nthe organizers and secretaries entered whole-heartedly. They realized\r\nthat modern labor organizations cannot depend wholly upon idealism. They\r\nbore in mind that they were dealing with human beings and had to adopt\r\nsound principles of responsibility, standardization and general\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nBut another factor in the success of the campaign possibly even more\r\nimportant than the systems employed was the splendid morale of the\r\norganizers. A better, more loyal body of men was never gathered together\r\nupon this continent. They knew no such word as defeat. They pressed on\r\nwith an irresistible assurance of victory born of their faith in the\r\npracticability of the theory upon which the campaign was worked out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIONAL COMMITTEE DELEGATES\r\n\r\nYOUNGSTOWN, OHIO MEETING, Aug. 20, 1919.--Standing, left to\r\nright: F.

C.\r\nCashen, _Switchmen_; D. J. Davis, _Amalgamated Association_.]\r\n\r\nThe organization of workingmen into trade unions is a comparatively\r\nsimple matter when it is properly handled. It depends almost entirely\r\nupon the honesty, intelligence, power and persistence of the organizing\r\nforces. If these factors are strongly present, employers can do little\r\nto stop the movement of their employees. This is because the hard\r\nindustrial conditions powerfully predispose the workers to take up any\r\nmovement offering reasonable prospects of bettering their miserable lot.\r\nAll that union organizers have to do is to place before these\r\npsychologically ripe workers, with sufficient clarity and persistence,\r\nthe splendid achievements of the trade-union movement, and be prepared\r\nwith a comprehensive organization plan to take care of the members when\r\nthey come. If this presentation of trade unionism is made in even\r\nhalf-decent fashion the workers can hardly fail to respond. It is\r\nlargely a mechanical proposition. In view of its great wealth and latent\r\npower, it may be truthfully said that there isn't an industry in the\r\ncountry which the trade-union movement cannot organize any time it sees\r\nfit. The problem in any case is merely to develop the proper organizing\r\ncrews and systems, and the freedom-hungry workers, skilled or unskilled,\r\nmen or women, black or white, will react almost as naturally and\r\ninevitably as water runs down hill.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that there should be rosy-hued hopes held out to the\r\nworkers and promises made to them of what the unions will get from the\r\nemployers once they are established. On the contrary, one of the first\r\nprinciples of an efficient organizer is never, under any circumstances,\r\nto make promises to his men. From experience he has learned the extreme\r\ndifficulty of making good such promises and also the destructive\r\nkick-back felt in case they are not fulfilled. The most he can do is to\r\ntell his men what has been done in other cases by organized workingmen\r\nand assure them that if they will stand together the union will do its\r\nutmost to help them. Beyond this he will not venture. And this position\r\nwill enable him to develop the legitimate hope, idealism and enthusiasm\r\nwhich translates itself into substantial trade-union structure. The wild\r\nstories of extravagant promises made to the steel workers during their\r\norganization are pure tommyrot, as every experienced union man knows.\r\n\r\nThe practical effect of this theory is to throw on the union men the\r\nburden of responsibility for the unorganized condition of the\r\nindustries. This is as it should be. In consequence, they tend to blame\r\nthemselves rather than the unorganized men. Instead of indulging in the\r\ncustomary futile lamentations about the scab-like nature of the\r\nnon-union man, \"unorganizable industries,\" the irresistible power of the\r\nemployers, and similar illusions to which unionists are too prone, they\r\nseek the solution of the problem in improvements of their own primitive\r\norganization methods.\r\n\r\nThis conception worked admirably in the steel campaign. It filled the\r\norganizers with unlimited confidence in their own power. They felt that\r\nthey were the decisive factor in the situation. If they could but\r\npresent their case strongly enough, and clearly enough to the steel\r\nworkers, the latter would have to respond, and the steel barons would be\r\nunable to prevent it. A check or a failure was but the signal for an\r\noverhauling of the tactics used, and a resumption of the attack with\r\nrenewed vigor. At times it was almost laughable. With hardly an\r\nexception, when the organizers went into a steel town to begin work,\r\nthey would be met by the local union men and solemnly assured that it\r\nwas utterly impossible to organize the steel mills in their town. \"But,\"\r\nthe organizers would say, \"we succeeded in organizing Gary and South\r\nChicago and many other tough places.\" \"Yes, we know that,\" would be the\r\nreply, \"but conditions are altogether different here. These mills are\r\nabsolutely impossible. We have worked on them for years and cannot make\r\nthe slightest impression. They are full of scabs from all over the\r\ncountry. You will only waste your time by monkeying with them.\" This\r\nhappened not in one place alone, but practically everywhere--illustrating\r\nthe villainous reputation the steel companies had built up as union\r\nsmashers.\r\n\r\nSide-stepping these pessimistic croakers, the organizers would go on to\r\ntheir task with undiminished self-confidence and energy. The result was\r\nsuccess everywhere. The National Committee can boast the proud record of\r\nnever having set up its organizing machinery in a steel town without\r\nultimately putting substantial unions among the employees. It made\r\nlittle difference what the obstacles were; the chronic lack of funds;\r\nsuppression of free speech and free assembly; raises in wages;\r\nmultiplicity of races; mass picketing by bosses; wholesale discharge of\r\nunion men; company unions; discouraging traditions of lost local\r\nstrikes; or what not--in every case, whether the employers were\r\nindifferent or bitterly hostile, the result was the same, a healthy and\r\nrapid growth of the unions. The National Committee proved beyond\r\nperadventure of a doubt that the steel industry could be organized in\r\nspite of all the Steel Trust could do to prevent it.\r\n\r\nEach town produced its own particular crop of problems. A chapter apiece\r\nwould hardly suffice to describe the discouraging obstacles overcome in\r\norganizing the many districts. But that would far outrun the limits of\r\nthis volume. A few details about the work in Johnstown will suffice to\r\nindicate the tactics of the employers and the nature of the campaign\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nJohnstown is situated on the main line of the Pennsylvania railroad,\r\nseventy-five miles east of Pittsburgh. It is the home of the Cambria\r\nSteel Company, which employs normally from 15,000 to 17,000 men in its\r\nenormous mills and mines. It is one of the most important steel centers\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nFor sixty-six years the Cambria Company had reared its black stacks in\r\nthe Conemaugh valley and ruled as autocratically as any mediaeval baron.\r\nIt practically owned the district and the dwellers therein. It paid its\r\nworkers less than almost any other steel company in Pennsylvania and was\r\nnoted as one of the country's worst union-hating concerns. According to\r\nold residents, the only record of unionism in its plants, prior to the\r\nNational Committee campaign, was a strike in 1874 of the Sons of Vulcan,\r\nand a small movement a number of years later, in 1885, when a few men\r\njoined the Knights of Labor and were summarily discharged. The\r\nAmalgamated Association, even in its most militant days, was unable to\r\nget a grip in Johnstown. That town, for years, bore the evil reputation\r\nof being one where union organizers were met at the depot and given the\r\nalternative of leaving town or going to the lockup.\r\n\r\nInto this industrial jail of a city the National Committee went in the\r\nearly winter of 1918-19, at the invitation of local steel workers who\r\nhad heard of the campaign. A. F. of L. organizer Thomas J. Conboy was\r\nplaced in charge of the work. Immediately a strong organization spirit\r\nmanifested itself--the wrongs of two-thirds of a century would out. It\r\nwas interesting to watch the counter-moves of the company. They were\r\ntypical. At first the officials contented themselves by stationing\r\nnumbers of bosses and company detectives in front of the office and\r\nmeeting halls to jot down the names of the men attending. But when this\r\navailed nothing, they took the next step by calling the live union\r\nspirits to the office and threatening them with dismissal. This likewise\r\nfailed to stem the tide of unionism, and then the company officials\r\napplied their most dreaded weapon, the power of discharge. This was a\r\ndangerous course; the reason they did not adopt it before was for fear\r\nof its producing exactly the revolt they were aiming to prevent. But,\r\nall else unavailing, they went to this extreme.\r\n\r\nNever was a policy of industrial frightfulness more diabolically\r\nconceived or more rigorously executed than that of the Cambria Steel\r\nCompany. The men sacrificed were the Company's oldest and best\r\nemployees. Men who had worked faithfully for ten, twenty or thirty years\r\nwere discharged at a moment's notice. The plan was to pick out the men\r\neconomically most helpless; men who were old and crippled, or who had\r\nlarge families dependent upon them, or homes half paid for, and make\r\nexamples of them to frighten the rest. The case of Wm. H. Seibert was\r\ntypical; this man, a highly skilled mechanic, had worked for the Cambria\r\nCompany thirty years. He was deaf and dumb, and could neither read nor\r\nwrite. He was practically cut off from all communication with his fellow\r\nworkers. Yet the company, with fiendish humor, discharged him for being\r\na union agitator. For every worker, discharge by the Cambria Company\r\nmeant leaving Johnstown, if he would again work at his trade; for most\r\nof them it brought the severest hardships, but for such as Seibert it\r\nspelled ruin. With their handicaps of age and infirmities, they could\r\nnever hope to work in steel mills again.\r\n\r\nFor months the Company continued these tactics.[6] Hundreds of union men\r\nwere thus victimized. The object was to strike terror to the hearts of\r\nall and make them bow again to the mastery of the Cambria Steel Company.\r\nBut the terrorists overshot the mark. Human nature could not endure it.\r\nThey goaded their workers to desperation and forced them to fight back,\r\nhowever unfavorable the circumstances. The National Committee met in\r\nJohnstown and ordered a ballot among the men. They voted overwhelmingly\r\nto strike. A committee went to see Mr. Slick, the head of the Company,\r\nwho refused to meet it, stating that if the men had any grievances they\r\ncould take them up through the company union.\r\n\r\nThis company union played a large part in the drama of Johnstown. It was\r\norganized late in 1918 to forestall the trade unions. Such company\r\nunions are invariably mere auxiliaries to the companies' labor-crushing\r\nsystems. They serve to delude the workers into believing they have some\r\nsemblance of industrial democracy, and thus deter them from seeking the\r\nreal thing. They consist merely of committees, made up for the most part\r\nof hand-picked bosses and \"company suckers.\" There is no real\r\norganization of the workers. The men have no meetings off the property\r\nof the companies; they lack the advice of skilled trade unionists; they\r\nhave no funds or means to strike effectively; they are out of touch with\r\nthe workers in other sections of the industry. Consequently they have\r\nneither opportunity to formulate their grievances, nor power to enforce\r\ntheir adjustment. And little good would it do them if they had, for the\r\nlickspittle committees are always careful to see that they handle no\r\nbusiness unless it relates to \"welfare\" work or other comparatively\r\ninsignificant matters.\r\n\r\nCompany unions are invariably contemptible. All of them are cursed with\r\ncompany dictation, and all of them lack the vivifying principles of\r\ndemocratic control; but it is doubtful if a more degraded specimen can\r\nbe found anywhere than that of the Cambria Steel Company. Without a\r\nmurmur of protest it watched the company abolish the basic eight hour\r\nday late in 1918. Nor did it raise a finger to help the multitude of\r\nunfairly discharged union men. It habitually pigeonholed all real\r\ngrievances submitted to it. But what else could be expected of a\r\ncommittee from which the company boldly discharged every man who dared\r\nsay a word for the workers?\r\n\r\nBy referring the men's grievances to the despised company union, Mr.\r\nSlick only added fuel to the fire. A strike loomed threateningly, but\r\njust as it was about to break, Mr. Slick lost his job, presumably\r\nbecause of his unsuccessful labor policy. He was supplanted by A. A.\r\nCorey, Jr., formerly general superintendent of the Homestead Steel\r\nWorks. Thinking perhaps the change in personnel might involve a change\r\nin policy, the committee approached Mr. Corey. He, too, refused to meet\r\nwith it, stating publicly that the management would not deal with the\r\nrepresentatives of outside organizations, but would take up the men's\r\ngrievances, either through the company union, or \"through any other\r\naccredited committee selected by the men in any way that is agreeable to\r\nthem from among their own number.\" The last proposition was acceptable,\r\nand with joy the men held big open mass meetings of union and non-union\r\nmen, and elected their committee. But their joy was short-lived. Mr.\r\nCorey, unashamed, wrote the committee that he had acted hastily before,\r\nand said, \"I have had no previous experience with arrangements in the\r\nnature of collective bargaining, but a careful survey of this plan\r\n(company union), which I have since had time to make, convinces me that\r\nit makes full and complete provision for every contingency which can\r\narise between the company and its employees.\" And then to make the men\r\nlike this bitter medicine, the Company discharged an active member of\r\nthe committee. All these events consumed many weeks and wore away the\r\nlate winter and early spring months.\r\n\r\nMr. Corey's double-dealing provoked a fresh strike crisis; but by heroic\r\nmeasures the organizers repressed it. At all times a strike in Johnstown\r\nalone against the united steel companies was considered a move of\r\ndesperation, a last resort to be undertaken only because nothing else\r\ncould be done. But now relief was in sight. Spring was at hand and the\r\nnational movement fast coming to a head. Its committees were knocking at\r\nthe doors of the steel companies. The exposed and invaluable Johnstown\r\nposition had to be held until this main army could come up and relieve\r\nit. So the Johnstown workers were told that they must refrain from\r\ncounter-attacking, that they had to take all the blows heaped upon them\r\nand hold their ground at all costs.\r\n\r\nAnd right nobly they did it. In spite of the bitterest hardships they\r\nbuilt up and developed their organizations. In this they were\r\nunwittingly but powerfully aided by the company union. Several weeks\r\nbefore the big strike the officials took the hated general committee to\r\nAtlantic City, wined them and dined them and flattered them, as usual,\r\nand then had them adopt a set of resolutions condemning the national\r\nmovement of the steel workers and endorsing long hours, low wages and\r\nheavier production as the remedy for prevailing bad conditions. This\r\nbetrayal was the last straw. It provoked intense resentment among the\r\nmen. Whole battalions of them, the most skilled and difficult in the\r\nplant to organize, walked down and joined the unions in protest. Almost\r\n3000 enrolled the week after the resolutions were adopted. But it was\r\nalways thus. Every move that the Cambria made the unions turned to their\r\nadvantage. They outgeneraled the Company at every turn.\r\n\r\nIt was almost pitiful to watch the later antics of the haughty and\r\nhitherto unchallenged Cambria Company, humbled in its own town by its\r\nown workers. A few weeks before Labor day the unions, innocently\r\npresuming the mills would be closed as usual on that day, decided to\r\nhave a parade. Then the strategical experts of the Company became\r\nactive. A warning was issued that every man marching in the parade would\r\nbe summarily discharged. The unions would not brook this unwarranted and\r\ncold-blooded attack. They promptly sent word to the Company that if a\r\nsingle man was discharged the whole plant would be stopped the next day.\r\nIt was a clear-cut issue, and Johnstown held its breath. When Labor day\r\ncame the city saw the biggest demonstration in its history. Fifteen\r\nthousand organized workers defied their would-be masters and marched.\r\nThe Company swiftly backed water. And the next day not a man was\r\ndischarged. It was a victory well worth the heroic efforts and suffering\r\nof the previous eight months.\r\n\r\nWhen the great strike broke on September 22 the Johnstown workers went\r\ninto the fight almost one hundred per cent. organized, and with about\r\nthe same percentage of grievances. So few men were left in the plant\r\nthat the Company had to ask the unions to give them help to shut down\r\ntheir furnaces, and to keep the fire protection in operation. All the\r\npower of the great corporation, which had made $30,000,000 the year\r\nbefore, could not forestall the unions. It had no arrow in its quiver\r\nthat could strike fear to the hearts of its workers; no trick in its\r\nbrain pan that could be substituted for industrial democracy.\r\n\r\nAnd Johnstown was only one point in the long battle line. Its\r\nexperiences were but typical. Each steel town had its own bitter story\r\nof obstacles encountered and overcome. Youngstown, Chicago, Bethlehem,\r\nCleveland, Wheeling, Pueblo, Buffalo and many other districts, each put\r\nup a hard fight. But one by one, despite all barriers, steel towns all\r\nover the country were captured for unionism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] As a side light on organizing methods, it may be noted that the\r\ntemporary receipts were red, white and blue cards. The patriotic\r\nforeigners were proud to carry these emblematic cards pending the time\r\nthey got their regular cards. More than one man joined merely on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[6] In its war against unionism the Cambria Steel Company held nothing\r\nsacred, not even the church. During the campaign the Reverend George\r\nDono Brooks, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Johnstown, took an\r\nactive part, speaking at many meetings and generally lending\r\nencouragement to the workers. For this crime the company punished him by\r\ndisrupting his congregation and eventually driving him from the city,\r\npenniless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBREAKING INTO PITTSBURGH\r\n\r\n    THE FLYING SQUADRON--MONESSEN--DONORA--McKEESPORT--RANKIN\r\n      --BRADDOCK--CLAIRTON--HOMESTEAD--DUQUESNE--THE RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time was now ripe for a great drive on Pittsburgh, a district which\r\nhad been the despair of unionism for a generation. The new strategy of\r\nthe National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers was\r\nsucceeding. Pittsburgh had been surrounded by organized posts,\r\nestablished during the winter. The Chicago district had also been held.\r\nThe committee's finances were improving. The crew of organizers was\r\nlarger and more enthusiastic than ever. The mills were operating\r\nstronger and stronger. And spring was here. The movement was now ready\r\nfor a tremendous effort to capture Pittsburgh, and thus overcome, as far\r\nas might be, the original mistake of not starting the campaign soon\r\nenough and everywhere at the same time. This done, it would put the work\r\nsquarely upon the essential national basis. So the assault was ordered\r\non the stronghold of the Steel Trust.\r\n\r\nFirst free speech and free assembly had to be established; for the towns\r\nabout Pittsburgh were still closed tight against the unions. During the\r\nwinter incessant attempts had been made to break the embargo by\r\npolitical methods, but without avail. In vain a special convention of\r\nall the unions in Western Pennsylvania had appealed to the Governor for\r\nassistance. For a moment the federal Department of Labor displayed a\r\nlanguid interest and sent a dozen men to investigate conditions. But\r\nuntil this day their report has never appeared. In answer to inquiries,\r\nthe Secretary of Labor is reported to have said that \"its publication at\r\nthis time would be inadvisable.\" That may be one reason, and another may\r\nbe that the Department, in its eager cooperation with Attorney General\r\nPalmer, in deporting hundreds of workingmen without trials, is so busy\r\nthat it hasn't time to attend to such trifles as the wholesale\r\nsuppression of constitutional rights in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBut in seeking relief no appeal was made to the courts to set up the\r\nrights of the unions. This was for two reasons. First, it would involve\r\nsuch a loss of time that the chance to organize the steel workers would\r\nhave passed long before any decision could be secured. Then, again,\r\nthere was no faith that the courts of Pennsylvania would be just, and\r\nthe National Committee had no money to carry the fight higher. The\r\nunions conceived their rights to speak and assemble freely too well\r\nestablished to necessitate court sanction at this late date. Hence, they\r\ndetermined to exercise them, peacefully and lawfully, and to take the\r\nconsequences. At Atlantic City, where the A. F. of L. was in convention,\r\na dozen presidents of international unions in the steel campaign\r\nexpressed their willingness to enter the steel districts, to speak on\r\nthe streets, and to go to jail if necessary.\r\n\r\nTo carry on the difficult and dangerous free speech fight, and to\r\noversee generally the organization of the immediate Pittsburgh district,\r\na special crew of organizers was formed. This was known as \"The Flying\r\nSquadron,\" and was headed by J. L. Beaghen, A. F. of L. organizer and\r\nPresident of the Pittsburgh Bricklayers' Union. The following brief\r\nreferences to the fights in the various towns will illustrate the forces\r\nat play and the methods employed.\r\n\r\nMonessen, forty miles from Pittsburgh on the Monongahela river, the home\r\nof the Pittsburgh Steel Company and several other large concerns, and\r\nnotorious as the place where organizer Jeff. Pierce got his death blow\r\nin a previous campaign, was the first point of attack. Wm. Feeney,\r\nUnited Mine Workers' organizer and local secretary in charge of the\r\ndistrict for the National Committee, superintended operations. Several\r\nmonths previously the Burgess of Monessen had flatly refused to allow\r\nhim to hold any meetings in that town. So he was compelled to operate\r\nfrom Charleroi, several miles away. But as soon as spring peeped the\r\nquestion was opened again. He called a meeting to take place square in\r\nthe streets of Monessen on April 1st. The Burgess forbade it with\r\nflaming pronunciamentos and threatened dire consequences if it were\r\nheld. But Feeney went ahead, and on the date set marched 10,000 union\r\nminers from the surrounding country into Monessen to protest the\r\nsuppression of free speech and free assembly. Mother Jones,[7] James\r\nMaurer, President of the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor, Philip\r\nMurray, President of District No. 5, U. M. W. A., Mr. Feeney, the writer\r\nand others spoke. The demonstration was a huge success. Public opinion\r\nwas clearly on the side of the steel workers, and the Burgess had to\r\nrecede from his dictatorial attitude and allow them to exercise their\r\nconstitutional rights. This they hastened to do with gusto. The affair\r\nestablished the unions in the big mills of Monessen.\r\n\r\nIn Donora, an important steel town a few miles down the river from\r\nMonessen, and part of organizer Feeney's district, the fight was not so\r\neasily won. The United States Constitution provides that not even\r\nCongress may pass laws abridging the rights of free speech and free\r\nassembly; but in Pennsylvania the Constitution is considered a sort of\r\nhumorous essay; hence the lickspittle Donora council, right in the face\r\nof the steel campaign, passed an ordinance forbidding public meetings\r\nwithout the sanction of the Burgess, which sanction, of course, the\r\nunions could not get. But nothing deterred, the indomitable Feeney hired\r\na couple of lots on the edge of the town and held meetings there. The\r\ncompany officials left nothing undone to break up these gatherings. They\r\nheld band concerts and ball games at the same hour, and set dozens of\r\ntheir bosses and police to picket the meetings. But it was no use; the\r\nworkers attended and joined the unions in droves.\r\n\r\nThis lasted a couple of months. And all the while a local paper was\r\nvillainously assailing Feeney. Finally, the steel company agents got the\r\nbusiness men to sign an ultimatum to Feeney, demanding that he leave the\r\ndistrict at once. Feeney took this matter up with his miners, and they\r\ndecided that not he, but they, would quit Donora. Organized solidly,\r\nthey easily put a strict boycott on the town, and it was not long before\r\nthe same business men, with their trade almost ruined, made a public\r\napology to Feeney, and ousted their own officials who had been\r\nresponsible for the attack.\r\n\r\nNaturally these events heartened the steel workers. They organized very\r\nrapidly, and soon had a majority of the men in the mills--a large plant\r\nof the American Steel and Wire Company. They also became a big factor in\r\nthe local fraternal associations, which controlled all the halls; and\r\nsuddenly the Lithuanian Society deposed its President, who was friendly\r\nto the steel company, and voted to give its hall to the unions, permits\r\nor no permits. In the face of this situation the Burgess reluctantly\r\ngranted sanction for union meetings. And thus free speech and free\r\nassembly were established in the benighted town of Donora, and with\r\nthem, almost complete organization of the steel workers.\r\n\r\nBut the heart of the conspiracy against free speech and free assembly\r\nwas in McKeesport, twenty miles from Pittsburgh. When the organizers\r\ntried to hold meetings in that city they could hire no halls without\r\nthe Mayor's permission, and this the latter, George H. Lysle, stubbornly\r\nrefused to give. He feared a revolution if the staid A. F. of L. unions\r\nwere permitted to meet; but the Socialist party and other radical\r\norganizations went ahead with their gatherings without opposition. The\r\ntruth was that he knew the unions would organize the workers if they\r\ncould but get their ear, and this he determined to prevent. Nor would he\r\nshift from his autocratic position. Appeals by the organizers to the\r\nFederal government, the Governor and the local city council were alike\r\nfruitless. No meetings could be held in McKeesport. And the officials of\r\nall the steel towns along the Monongahela river, drawing inspiration\r\nfrom the little despot, Lysle, took the same stand. Free speech and free\r\nassembly were stifled in the whole district.\r\n\r\nThe Federal authorities being so active setting the outside world aright\r\nthat they could find no time or occasion to correct the most glaring\r\nabuses at home, the unions resolved to attend to the free speech and\r\nfree assembly matter themselves. Knowing that Lysle could knife the\r\nworkers' rights only so long as he was allowed to work in the dark, they\r\ndetermined to drag him into the daylight and let the public judge of his\r\ndeeds. They would hold meetings on the streets of McKeesport in spite of\r\nhim; give him a few hundred test court cases to handle, and finally find\r\nout whether the A. F. of L. is entitled to the same rights as other\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe fight opened as soon as the weather permitted. May 18 was the date\r\nset for the first meeting. The Mayor stormed and threatened all\r\nconcerned with instant arrest; but the preparations went on just the\r\nsame. When the fated day arrived thousands turned out to hear the\r\nspeakers. But the Mayor, failing to defend his course, dared not molest\r\nthe meeting. After this, meetings were held on the streets each Sunday\r\nafternoon, always in the face of the Mayor's threats, until eventually\r\nthe latter, seeing that he was the laughing stock of the city and that\r\nthe street meetings were organizing hundreds of the workers,\r\nshame-facedly granted the following niggardly permit for meetings:\r\n\r\n  CITY OF McKEESPORT.\r\n\r\n  Department of Police.\r\n  McKeesport, Pa., July 7, 1919.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Reddington,\r\n  Chief of Police,\r\n  McKeesport, Pa.,\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n  This is to certify that the McKeesport Council\r\n  of Labor has permission to hold a mass meeting in\r\n  Slavish Hall on White Street on July 8, 1919.\r\n\r\n  Permission is granted subject to the following conditions,\r\n  and also subject to police regulation.\r\n\r\n  (1st) That no speaker shall talk in any other\r\n  languages, except the English language.\r\n\r\n  (2nd) That a list of the speakers be submitted\r\n  to the Mayor before the meeting is held.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  (Signed) Geo. H. Lysle\r\n  Mayor\r\n\r\nDisregarding the three provisions of this contemptible document, the\r\nunions held their meetings under the auspices of the A. F. of L. (not of\r\nthe McKeesport Council of Labor), had their speakers talk in whatever\r\nlanguages their hearers best understood, and submitted no list to Lysle.\r\nThen the big steel companies rushed to the aid of the hard-pressed\r\nMayor. All the while they had discharged every man they could locate who\r\nhad either joined the unions or expressed sympathy with them, but now\r\nthey became more active. As each meeting was held they stationed about\r\nthe hall doors (under the captaincy of Mr. William A. Cornelius, Manager\r\nof the National Tube Company's works) at least five hundred of their\r\nbosses, detectives, office help, and \"loyal\" workers to intimidate the\r\nmen who were entering. About three hundred more would be sent into the\r\nhall to disrupt the meetings. And woe to the man they recognized, for he\r\nwas discharged the next morning. The organizers, running the gauntlet of\r\nthese Steel Trust gunmen, carried their very lives in their hands.\r\n\r\nUnder these hard circumstances few steel workers dared to go to the\r\nmeetings or to the union headquarters. But the organizations grew\r\nrapidly nevertheless. Every discharged man became a volunteer organizer\r\nand busied himself getting his friends to enroll. A favorite trick to\r\nescape the espionage was to get a group of men, from a dozen to fifty,\r\nto meet quietly in one of the homes, fill out their applications, and\r\nsend them by a sister or wife to the union headquarters--the detectives\r\nstationed outside naturally not knowing the women. Conditions in the\r\nlocal mills were so bad that not even the most desperate employers'\r\ntactics could stop the progress of the unions. McKeesport quickly became\r\none of the strong organization points on the river.\r\n\r\nSweeping onward through the Pittsburgh district, the unions gained great\r\nheadway by the collapse of the petty Czar of McKeesport, for all the\r\nlittle nabobs in the adjoining steel towns felt the effects of his\r\ndefeat. Rankin fell without a blow. A few months before the hall had\r\nbeen closed there by the local board of health, when the Burgess refused\r\nto act against the unions. But now no objections were made to the\r\nmeetings. Braddock also capitulated easily. At a street meeting held in\r\nthe middle of town against the Burgess' orders, organizers J. L.\r\nBeaghen, R. L. Hall, J. C. Boyle, J. B. Gent and the writer were\r\narrested. The Burgess, however, not wishing to meet the issue, found it\r\nconvenient to leave town, and the Acting Burgess, declaring in open\r\ncourt that he would not \"do the dirty work of the Burgess,\" postponed\r\nthe hearings indefinitely. That settled Braddock.\r\n\r\nBurgess Williams of North Clairton, chief of the Carnegie mill police at\r\nthat point, swore dire vengeance against the free speech fighters should\r\nthey come to his town. But the National Committee, choosing a lot owned\r\nby its local secretary on the main street of North Clairton, called a\r\nmeeting there one bright Sunday afternoon. But hardly had it started\r\nwhen, with a great flourish of clubs, the police broke up the gathering\r\nand arrested organizers J. G. Brown, J. Manley, A. A. Lassich, P. H.\r\nBrogan, J. L. Beaghen, R. L. Hall, and the writer. Later all were fined\r\nfor holding a meeting on their own property. But the Burgess, learning\r\nthat the speaker for the following Sunday was Mother Jones of the\r\nMiners' Union, and that public sentiment was overwhelmingly against him,\r\ndecided not to fight. Instead he provided a place on the public commons\r\nfor open air meetings. The contest resulted in almost all of the local\r\nsteel workers joining the unions immediately.\r\n\r\nIn Homestead, however, that sacred shrine of Labor, the unions had to\r\nput up a harder fight. The Burgess there, one P. H. McGuire, is a\r\nveteran of the great Homestead strike, and for many years afterwards led\r\nthe local fight against the Carnegie Steel Company. But he has now fully\r\nrecovered from his unionism. He has made peace with the enemy. It was in\r\nthe early winter of 1918 that the unions first tried to hold meetings in\r\nhis town. But they were careful to make tentative arrangements for a\r\nhall before asking a permit from McGuire. The latter stated flatly that\r\nthere would be no union meetings in Homestead, saying no halls could be\r\nsecured. \"But,\" said the organizers, \"we have already engaged a hall.\"\r\nThe next day the rent money was returned with the explanation that a\r\nmistake had been made. Later the unions managed to sneak by the guard of\r\nthe ex-union man Burgess and hold a meeting or two--said to be the first\r\nsince the Homestead strike, twenty-six years before--but nothing\r\nsubstantial could be done, and the fight was called off for the winter.\r\n\r\nDuring the big spring drive on Pittsburgh the Flying Squadron turned\r\nits attention to Homestead as soon as the McKeesport and many other\r\npressing situations permitted. Mass meetings were held on the main\r\nstreets. At first the Burgess, with a weather eye on McKeesport, did not\r\nmolest these; but when he saw the tremendous interest the steel workers\r\nshowed and the rapidity with which they were joining the unions, he\r\nattempted to break up the meetings by arresting two of the organizers,\r\nJ. L. Beaghen and myself. At the trial McGuire, as magistrate, was shown\r\nthat his ordinance did not cover street meetings. \"But,\" said he, \"it's\r\nthe best we've got, and it will have to do.\" He fined the defendants,\r\nand a day or two later had an ordinance adopted to his liking. Such\r\ntrifles don't worry the executives in steel towns.\r\n\r\nBut such an enormous crowd assembled to witness the next street meeting\r\nthat McGuire had to agree to permit hall meetings. No sooner were they\r\nattempted however, than he broke his agreement. He would allow no\r\nlanguages other than English to be spoken--the object being to prevent\r\nthe foreign workers from understanding what was going on. Of course all\r\nother organizations in Homestead could use what tongues they pleased.\r\nThe unions balked, with the result that more street meetings were held\r\nand Mother Jones, J. G. Brown, R. W. Reilly and J. L. Beaghen were\r\narrested. Public indignation was intense; thousands marched the streets\r\nin protest; the unions grew like beanstalks. And so the affair went on\r\ntill the great strike broke on September 22.\r\n\r\nThat curse of the campaign since its inception, the lack of resources,\r\nbore down heavily on the work in the crucial summer months just before\r\nthe strike. At least one hundred more men should have been put in the\r\nfield to take advantage of the unparalleled opportunity. But the\r\nNational Committee could not beg, borrow or steal them. The organizers\r\nin the various localities fairly shrieked for help, but in vain.\r\nEspecially was the need keenly felt in the big drive on Pittsburgh.\r\nInstead of eight or ten men, which was all that the Flying Squadron\r\ncould muster, there ought to have been at least fifty men delegated to\r\nthe huge task of capturing the score of hard-baked steel towns on\r\nPittsburgh's three rivers. The consequence was that the work everywhere\r\nhad to be skimped, with disastrous effects later on in the strike. In\r\nthose towns where the unions did get started lack of help prevented\r\ntheir taking full advantage of the situation. And then some towns had to\r\nbe passed up altogether, although the men were infected with the general\r\nfever for organization and were calling for organizers. It was\r\nimpossible to send any one to either Woodlawn or Midland, both very\r\nimportant steel towns. Even the strategic city of Duquesne, with its\r\nenormous mills and blast furnaces, could not be started until three\r\nweeks before the strike.\r\n\r\nDuquesne is just across the river from McKeesport and only four miles\r\nfrom Homestead. It gave the organizers a hot reception. Its Mayor, James\r\nS. Crawford, is President of the First National Bank. His brother is\r\nPresident of the Port Vue Tinplate Company. Besides being Mayor, Mr.\r\nCrawford is city Commissioner, President of the city council, Director\r\nof Public Safety, and Magistrate. He makes the laws, executes them and\r\npunishes the violators. He is a true type of Pennsylvania steel town\r\npetty Kaiser and exercises his manifold powers accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo eager was the Mayor, popularly known as \"Toad\" Crawford, to give the\r\nworld a demonstration of Steel Trust Americanism that he challenged the\r\norganizers to come to his town. He even offered to meet in personal\r\ncombat one of the men in charge of the campaign. Of course he\r\ninsultingly refused to grant permits for meetings. The organizers, who\r\ncould not hire an office in the place, so completely were the property\r\nowners dominated by the steel companies, managed to lease a couple of\r\nlots in an obscure part of town. But when they attempted to hold a\r\nmeeting there Mr. Crawford jailed three of them, J. L. Beaghen, J.\r\nMcCaig, and J. G. Sause. The next day he fined them each $100 and costs.\r\n\r\nRabbi Wise of New York was the speaker billed for the following Sunday.\r\nBut the Steel Trust Mayor forbade his meeting. And when it was proposed\r\nto have Frank Morrison, with whom Crawford boasted a slight\r\nacquaintance, confer with him about the situation, he declared, \"It\r\nwon't do you any good. Jesus Christ himself could not speak in Duquesne\r\nfor the A. F. of L!\" It so happened that Rabbi Wise was unable to come\r\nto Pennsylvania for his scheduled lectures on behalf of the steel\r\nworkers, and the organizers held the Duquesne meeting themselves.\r\nCrawford had his whole police force on hand and immediately arrested the\r\nspeakers, Mother Jones, J. L. Beaghen and the writer. Forty-four steel\r\nworkers, all the jail would hold, were arrested also, for no other\r\nreason than attending the meeting. Organizer J. M. Patterson, who had\r\nnothing to do with the gathering, was thrown into jail merely for trying\r\nto find out what bail we were held for. The next day the organizers were\r\neach fined $100 and costs, and the rest from $25 to $50 apiece.[8] In\r\nsentencing Mr. Beaghen, Mayor Crawford declared that nothing would be\r\nmore pleasurable than to give him 99 years, and then be on hand when he\r\ngot out to give him 99 more.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor was going it strong; but he was riding fast to a hard fall.\r\nThe unions were planning to bring to Duquesne some of the most prominent\r\nmen in the United States and to give Crawford the fight of his life,\r\nwhen the outbreak of the great strike swamped them with work and\r\ncompelled them to turn their attention elsewhere.[9]\r\n\r\nWhatever its general disadvantages, in some respects, at least, the\r\nfree speech fight was very good for the unions. For one thing, it served\r\nwonderfully well to infuse the necessary hope and confidence into the\r\nsteel workers. So tremendous had been the manifestations of the Steel\r\nTrust--its long record of victory over the trade unions, its vast wealth\r\nand undisputed political supremacy, its enormous mills and furnaces--so\r\ntremendous had been all these influences that they had overcome the\r\nindividual workers with a profound sense of insignificance and\r\nhelplessness, and practically destroyed all capacity for spontaneous\r\naction. What the steel men needed to rouse them from their lethargy was\r\na demonstration of power from outside, a tangible sign that there was\r\nsome institution through which they could help themselves. Throughout\r\nthe campaign this consideration was borne in mind, and bands and other\r\nspectacular methods of advertising were used to develop among the steel\r\nworkers a feeling of the greatness and power of the unions. Nor were\r\nthese methods unsuccessful. Most effective of all, however, was the free\r\nspeech fight in Pennsylvania. That gave the unions a golden opportunity\r\nto defeat the Steel Trust so easily and spectacularly that the steel\r\nworkers couldn't help but be encouraged thereby. They simply had to cast\r\nin their lot with a movement able to defeat so handily their autocratic\r\nmasters. And once they came in they felt the utmost confidence in their\r\nleaders, the men they had seen jailed time and again for fighting their\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of The Flying Squadron's heroic battles in the immediate\r\nPittsburgh district the whole campaign was put practically upon a\r\nnational basis, where it should have been at the start. Almost every\r\nsteel centre in America was being organized simultaneously. Members were\r\nstreaming into the co-operating unions by thousands. The entire steel\r\nindustry was on the move. Perhaps it may be fitting to introduce at this\r\npoint an official digest of the general report of the number of men\r\norganized by the National Committee during the whole campaign. The\r\nreport covers the period up to January 31, 1920, but almost all of the\r\nmen were enrolled before the strike started on September 22.\r\n\r\n                        GENERAL REPORT\r\n                              on\r\n       250,000 members enrolled by the National Committee for\r\n           Organizing Iron and Steel Workers during the\r\n             American Federation of Labor Organizing\r\n              Campaign in the Steel Industry, from\r\n                 August 1, 1918, until January\r\n                            31, 1920.\r\n\r\n         _By Localities_                       _By Trades_\r\n\r\n  South Chicago             6,616     Blacksmiths               5,699\r\n  Chicago Heights             569     Boilermakers              2,097\r\n  Misc.

It represents approximately 50 to 60\r\nper cent. of the total number of steel workers organized during the\r\ncampaign, and is minimum in every respect.\r\n\r\nThe report does not include any of the many thousands of men signed up\r\nat Bethlehem, Steelton, Reading, Apollo, New Kensington, Leechburg and\r\nmany minor points which felt the force of the drive but where the\r\nNational Committee made no deductions upon initiation fees. In Gary,\r\nJoliet, Indiana Harbor, South Chicago and other Chicago District points\r\nthe National Committee ceased collecting on initiation fees early in\r\n1919, hence this report makes no showing of the thousands of men signed\r\nup in that territory during the last few months of the campaign.\r\nLikewise, at Coatesville and Sparrows' Point, during only a short space\r\nof the campaign were deductions made for the National Committee. Many\r\nthousands more men were signed up directly by the multitude of local\r\nunions in the steel industry, that were not reported to the National\r\nCommittee. These do not show in this calculation. Nor do the great\r\nnumber of ex-soldiers who were taken into the unions free of initiation\r\nfees--in Johnstown alone 1300 ex-soldier steel workers joined the unions\r\nunder this arrangement. Of course no accounting is here included for the\r\narmy of workers in outside industries who became organized as a result\r\nof the tremendous impulse given by the steel campaign.\r\n\r\nIn view of these exceptions it may be conservatively estimated that well\r\nover 250,000 steel workers joined the unions notwithstanding the\r\nopposition of the Steel Trust, which discharged thousands of its\r\nworkers, completely suppressed free speech and free assembly in\r\nPennsylvania and used every known tactic to prevent the organization of\r\nits employees.\r\n\r\n  WM. Z. FOSTER,\r\n  Secretary-Treasurer\r\n  National Committee for Organizing\r\n  Iron & Steel Workers.\r\n\r\n  Certified by\r\n  Enoch Martin\r\n  Auditor, District No. 12\r\n  United Mine Workers of America.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Throughout the latter part of the organizing campaign and the first\r\ntwo months of the strike, Mother Jones lent great assistance to the\r\nsteel workers. This veteran organizer (she testified in court to being\r\n89 years old) of the United Mine Workers labored dauntlessly, going to\r\njail and meeting the hardships and dangers of the work in a manner that\r\nwould do credit to one half her age.\r\n\r\n[8] Relative to this meeting there occurs the following dialogue on page\r\n508 of the report on the Senate Committee's Hearings on the Steel\r\nStrike:\r\n\r\nSenator Sterling. \"Was Mr. Foster here prior to the strike?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Diehl (Gen. Manager Duquesne Works, Carnegie Steel Co.). \"Yes; he\r\nwas here trying to hold a meeting, but the meeting was not held.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman. \"What happened to the meeting?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Diehl. \"Well, we simply prohibited it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd naturally so. Mr. Diehl and other company officials shut off\r\nmeetings in the halls and on the lots of their towns just as readily as\r\nthey would have done had attempts been made to hold them in the mill\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n[9] Now that the strike is over and spring is again at hand, the unions\r\nhave resumed the battle for free speech and assembly in Duquesne and\r\npromise to fight it to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSTORM CLOUDS GATHER\r\n\r\n    RELIEF DEMANDED--THE AMALGAMATED ASSOCIATION MOVES--A GENERAL\r\n      MOVEMENT--THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE--GOMPERS' LETTER\r\n      UNANSWERED--THE STRIKE VOTE--GARY DEFENDS STEEL AUTOCRACY\r\n      --PRESIDENT WILSON ACTS IN VAIN--THE STRIKE CALL\r\n\r\n\r\nSurging forward to the accomplishment of the \"impossible,\" the\r\norganization of the steel industry, the twenty-four co-operating\r\ninternational unions found themselves in grips with the employers long\r\nbefore they were strong enough to sustain such a contest. It is almost\r\nalways so with new unions. In their infancy, when their members are\r\nweak, undisciplined and inexperienced, and the employers are bitterly\r\nhostile and aggressive, is exactly the time when they must establish\r\nprinciples and adjust grievances that would test the strength of the\r\nmost powerful unions. Inability to do so means dissolution, either\r\nthrough a lost strike or by disintegration. Following in the wake of the\r\nnewly formed steel workers' unions came a mass of such difficulties\r\nrequiring immediate settlement. The demand for relief from the evils of\r\nlong hours, low wages and miserable working conditions was bad enough;\r\nbut infinitely more serious was the need to take care of the army of men\r\ndischarged for union membership. Thousands of these walked the streets\r\nin the various steel towns clamoring for protection. And the men on the\r\njob demanded it for them. Nor could these appeals be ignored. Whether\r\nthey deemed the occasion propitious or not, the steel workers' unions,\r\non pain of extinction, had to act in defence of their harassed\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nSo bad was the situation by early spring that, lacking other means of\r\nrelief, local strikes were threatening all over the country. To allow\r\nthese forlorn-hope walkouts to occur would have meant disintegration and\r\ndisaster to the whole campaign. They had to be checked at all costs and\r\nthe movement kept upon a national basis. Therefore, the National\r\nCommittee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers called a general\r\nconference of delegates of steelworkers' unions of all trades through\r\nthe entire industry, to take place in Pittsburgh, May 25, 1919. The\r\nobject was to demonstrate to the rank and file how fast the national\r\nmovement was developing, to turn their attention to it strongly, and\r\nthus hearten them to bear their hardships until it could come to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nRight in the face of this general movement of all the trades the\r\nAmalgamated Association made a bid for separate consideration by the\r\nsteel companies. By instruction of its convention, President Tighe wrote\r\nthe following letter to Mr. Gary:\r\n\r\n      Convention Hall, Louisville, Ky., May 15, 1919\r\n      Honorable Elbert H. Gary, Chairman,\r\n      Executive Officers, United States Steel Corporation,\r\n      Hoboken, N. J.\r\n\r\n      _Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n      The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers\r\n      of North America, in National Convention assembled, have by\r\n      resolution, instructed the undersigned to address you as\r\n      Chairman of the Executive Officers of the United States\r\n      Steel Corporation on a matter which in the opinion of the\r\n      representatives of the Amalgamated Association of Iron,\r\n      Steel and Tin Workers, is of vital importance to the\r\n      Corporation you have the honor to represent and to the\r\n      Amalgamated Association.\r\n\r\n      As you no doubt are aware, there is a serious disturbing\r\n      element in the industrial world at the present time, a great\r\n      spirit of unrest has spread over our common country. It is\r\n      becoming more and more acute, and there is no telling when\r\n      or where the storm clouds will break. It is the judgment of\r\n      the representatives of the Amalgamated Association that it\r\n      is the patriotic duty of all good citizens to use their\r\n      every effort to stem the tide of unrest, if possible.\r\n\r\n      The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers\r\n      have admitted many thousands of the employees of the United\r\n      States Steel Corporation into their organization; these\r\n      members are asking that they be given consideration by the\r\n      Corporation you are the Honorable Chairman of, in their\r\n      respective crafts and callings, and also that as law-abiding\r\n      citizens who desire the privilege of having their\r\n      representatives meet with the chosen representatives of the\r\n      Corporation you represent, to jointly confer on questions\r\n      that mutually concern both.\r\n\r\n      Sincerely believing that the granting of their request on\r\n      your part will not only be the means of allaying that\r\n      unrest, but will also promote and insure that harmony and\r\n      co-operation that should at all times exist between employer\r\n      and employee to the end that all will share in the glorious\r\n      triumphs so lately achieved in the war and thereby add still\r\n      more to the lustre and glory of our common country.\r\n\r\n      Trusting that you will give this request on the part of the\r\n      aforesaid employees of your Corporation your most earnest\r\n      consideration, I await your pleasure.\r\n\r\n      M. F. TIGHE, International President\r\n      Hotel Tyler, Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\nTo this letter Mr. Gary replied as follows:\r\n\r\n      UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION\r\n\r\n      Chairman's Office,\r\n      New York, May 20th, 1919\r\n\r\n      Mr. M. F. Tighe,\r\n      International President,\r\n      Amalgamated Association of\r\n      Iron, Steel and Tin Workers,\r\n      Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\n      _Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n      I have read with interest your letter of May 15th inst. I\r\n      agree that it is the patriotic duty of all good citizens to\r\n      use their efforts in stemming the tide of unrest in the\r\n      industrial world whenever and wherever it exists.\r\n\r\n      As you know, we do not confer, negotiate with, or combat\r\n      labor unions as such. We stand for the open shop, which\r\n      permits a man to engage in the different lines of\r\n      employment, whether he belongs to a labor union or not. We\r\n      think this attitude secures the best results to the\r\n      employees generally and to the employers.\r\n\r\n      In our own way, and in accordance with our best judgment,\r\n      we are rendering efficient patriotic service in the\r\n      direction indicated by you.\r\n\r\n      With kind regards, I am,\r\n\r\n      Yours respectfully,\r\n      E. H. GARY, Chairman\r\n\r\nThe Amalgamated Association's action threatened the existence of the\r\ngeneral movement, but Mr. Gary's refusal to deal with its officials kept\r\nthem in the fold. Where the principle of solidarity was lacking outside\r\npressure served the same end. It would be interesting to hear the\r\nAmalgamated Association officials explain this attempt at desertion.\r\n\r\nAt the conference of May 25 there assembled 583 delegates, representing\r\ntwenty-eight international unions in eighty steel centers, the largest\r\ngathering of steel worker delegates in the history of the industry. The\r\nreports of the men present made it clearly evident that action had to be\r\ntaken to defend the interests of their constituents. Consequently,\r\ndisregarding the rebuff given the Amalgamated Association by Mr. Gary,\r\nthe conference, which was only advisory in character, adopted the\r\nfollowing resolution:\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, We have now arrived at a point in our\r\n      nation-wide campaign where our organizations control great\r\n      numbers of the workers in many of the most important steel\r\n      plants in America, and\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, Various officials of the iron and steel\r\n      industry, including Judge Gary, Charles Schwab, and other\r\n      heads of these gigantic corporations have expressed their\r\n      solicitude for the welfare of the workers in this industry,\r\n      and\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, They have been continuously quoted as\r\n      defenders of the rights of the workers in industry, and\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, The corporations, to block our progress,\r\n      are organizing company unions, discharging union men\r\n      wholesale and otherwise trying to break up our organization,\r\n      thus compelling us to take action to escape destruction,\r\n      therefore be it\r\n\r\n      RESOLVED, That it be the will of this conference\r\n      that a joint effort be made by all unions affiliated with\r\n      the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers\r\n      to enter into negotiations with the various steel companies\r\n      to the end that better wages, shorter hours, improved\r\n      working conditions and the trade-union system of collective\r\n      bargaining be established in the steel industry; and be it\r\n      further\r\n\r\n      RESOLVED, That this resolution be submitted for\r\n      action to the National Committee for Organizing Iron and\r\n      Steel Workers at its next meeting in Washington, D. C., May\r\n      27.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the National Committee met in Washington and adopted this\r\nresolution. The following were appointed as a conference committee to\r\nhave charge of the preliminary negotiations with the steel companies:\r\nSamuel Gompers, Chairman of the National Committee; John Fitzpatrick,\r\nActing Chairman; D. J. Davis, Amalgamated Association; Edw. J. Evans,\r\nElectrical Workers; Wm. Hannon, Machinists; Wm. Z. Foster, Railway\r\nCarmen. As the first approach, Mr. Gompers addressed the following\r\nletter to Mr. Gary, requesting a conference:\r\n\r\n      AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR\r\n\r\n      The Alamac Hotel,\r\n      Atlantic City, N. J., June 20, 1919\r\n\r\n      Mr. Elbert H. Gary, Chairman,\r\n      Board of Directors, U. S. Steel Corporation,\r\n      New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n      _Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n      Of course you are aware that upon the request of a number of\r\n      men in the employ of the United States Steel Corporation,\r\n      and realizing the need of it, the convention of the American\r\n      Federation of Labor decided to respond and give such\r\n      assistance as is possible in order to bring about more\r\n      thorough organization of the workers in the iron and steel\r\n      industry, particularly those employed by your Corporation.\r\n\r\n      A campaign of organization was begun in June, 1918, and\r\n      within that period we have secured the organization of more\r\n      than 100,000 of the employees in the iron and steel\r\n      industry. The prospects for the complete organization are, I\r\n      am informed, exceedingly bright.\r\n\r\n      Of course, knowing the policy of the Organized Labor\r\n      movement I have the honor in part to represent, we aim to\r\n      accomplish the purposes of our labor movement; that is,\r\n      better conditions for the toilers, by American methods, and\r\n      American understandings, not by revolutionary methods or the\r\n      inauguration of a cataclysm.\r\n\r\n      We believe in the effort of employer and employees to sit\r\n      down around a table and, meeting thus, face to face, and\r\n      having a better understanding of each other's position in\r\n      regard to conditions of labor, to hours, standards, etc.,\r\n      and after reaching an amicable understanding to enter into\r\n      an agreement for collective bargaining that is to cover\r\n      wages, hours of labor, conditions of employment, etc.\r\n\r\n      At the Atlantic City convention of the American Federation\r\n      of Labor just closed, the committee reported upon the\r\n      progress made, and I am instructed and authorized to suggest\r\n      to you whether you will consent to hold a conference with a\r\n      committee representing not only the iron and steel workers\r\n      who are organized, but representing the best interests of\r\n      the unorganized men in the employ of your Corporation. The\r\n      names of the committee I am asking you to meet are:\r\n\r\n      Assistant President Davis, Amalgamated Iron and Steel and\r\n      Tin Workers.\r\n\r\n      William Hannon, member executive board, International\r\n      Association of Machinists.\r\n\r\n      Edward Evans, representing International Brotherhood of\r\n      Electrical Workers.\r\n\r\n      Wm. Z. Foster, secretary of the National Committee for\r\n      Organizing Iron and Steel Workers and representing the\r\n      Brotherhood of Carmen of America.\r\n\r\n      John Fitzpatrick, president Chicago Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\n      If you can advise me at your early convenience that the\r\n      request contained in this letter meets with your approval\r\n      and that a conference can be held, I am sure I shall be\r\n      additionally appreciative.\r\n\r\n      Kindly address your reply, which I trust may be favorable,\r\n      to the American Federation of Labor Building, Washington, D.\r\n      C.\r\n\r\n      Respectfully yours,\r\n      SAMUEL GOMPERS,\r\n      President American Federation of Labor\r\n\r\nThis letter was sent during the A. F. of L. convention at Atlantic City.\r\nAbout the same time Mr. Gompers resigned the chairmanship of the\r\nNational Committee and appointed in his stead John Fitzpatrick, hitherto\r\nActing Chairman. Mr. Fitzpatrick has been President of the Chicago\r\nFederation of Labor for many years. He is a horseshoer by trade and one\r\nof America's sterling union men. Possessed of a broad idealism,\r\nunquestioned integrity, a magnetic personality and a wide knowledge of\r\ntrade-union practice, his services were beyond value as Chairman of the\r\ncommittees that carried on the organization work in the steel and\r\npacking industries. He is now taking an active part in the launching of\r\nthe new Labor party.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Gompers' courteous letter Czar Gary did not deign to reply. This\r\nwas bad. It looked like war. But the unions had no alternative; they had\r\nto go ahead. Conditions in the steel industry were so unbearable that\r\nthey had to exert their utmost power to right them, come what might.\r\nTherefore, after waiting several weeks for word from Mr. Gary, the\r\nNational Committee met, gave the situation profound consideration, and\r\nadopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, Working conditions in the steel industry\r\n      are so intolerable and the unrest arising therefrom so\r\n      intense that they can only be remedied by the application of\r\n      the principles of collective bargaining; and,\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, All efforts have failed to bring about a\r\n      conference between the heads of the great steel corporations\r\n      and the trade unions, representing many thousands of\r\n      organized steel workers, for the purpose of establishing\r\n      trade union conditions in the steel industry; therefore, be\r\n      it\r\n\r\n      RESOLVED, That the National Committee for\r\n      Organizing Iron and Steel Workers recommends to its 24\r\n      affiliated unions that they take a strike vote of their\r\n      local unions throughout the steel industry; and, be it\r\n      further\r\n\r\n      RESOLVED, That a special meeting be held in the\r\n      Pittsburgh Labor Temple, July 20th, at 10 A. M., of\r\n      representatives of all the co-operating international unions\r\n      for the purpose of taking action on this matter.\r\n\r\nThe National Committee meeting of July 20th, called in accordance with\r\nthe above resolution, approached the situation from every possible angle\r\nand with the keenest sense of responsibility. But it had to recognize\r\nthat the matter was wholly in the hands of Mr. Gary and his associates.\r\nThe resolution to take a strike vote of the men was re-adopted. Also the\r\nfollowing general demands, based on accurate surveys of the situation,\r\nand subject to revision over the conference table, were formulated:\r\n\r\n      1. Right of collective bargaining\r\n\r\n      2. Reinstatement of all men discharged for union activities\r\n         with pay for time lost\r\n\r\n      3. Eight hour day\r\n\r\n      4. One day's rest in seven\r\n\r\n      5. Abolition of 24-hour shift\r\n\r\n      6. Increases in wages sufficient to guarantee American\r\n         standard of living\r\n\r\n      7. Standard scales of wages in all trades and\r\n         classifications of workers\r\n\r\n      8. Double rates of pay for all overtime after 8 hours,\r\n         holiday and Sunday work\r\n\r\n      9. Check-off system of collecting union dues and assessments\r\n\r\n      10. Principles of seniority to apply in the maintenance,\r\n          reduction and increase of working forces\r\n\r\n      11. Abolition of company unions\r\n\r\n      12. Abolition of physical examination of applicants for\r\n          employment\r\n\r\nSo plain, fair and equitable are these demands that to reasonable\r\npeople they require no defence. The only explanation they might need\r\nrelates to #9 and #12. The check-off was to apply only to the mining end\r\nof the steel industry, and the abolition of the physical examination was\r\nto put a stop to the rank discrimination practiced by the companies\r\nthrough their medical departments.\r\n\r\nA month was allowed in which to take the vote. Each trade looked after\r\nits own members, with the National Committee voting those men who were\r\nenrolled but not yet turned over to their respective unions, and in some\r\ncases the unorganized also. Enthusiasm was intense. The steel workers\r\nsaw a glimmer of hope and welcomed with open arms the opportunity to\r\nright their crying wrongs. When the vote was tabulated in Youngstown,\r\nOhio, on August 20, it was found that every trade had voted\r\noverwhelmingly for a strike in case no settlement could be reached.\r\nWhole districts voted to a man in the affirmative. Of all the thousands\r\nof ballots cast in Homestead, Braddock, Rankin, McKeesport, Vandergrift,\r\nPittsburgh and Monessen not one was in the negative. Donora produced one\r\n\"no\" vote, with the great Youngstown, Chicago and Cleveland districts\r\nabout the same. Everywhere the sentiment was practically unanimous to\r\nmake a stand. The vote was calculated conservatively at 98 per cent. for\r\na strike. The Conference Committee was accordingly instructed to request\r\na conference with the heads of the United States Steel Corporation and\r\nthe big independent companies, and if at the end of ten days no such\r\nmeeting had been arranged, to set the strike date. [Illustration:\r\nSTRIKE BALLOT]\r\n\r\nTaking no further chances on unanswered letters, the Committee bearded\r\nMr. Gary in his lair at 71 Broadway. He was in but refused to meet the\r\nCommittee, requesting that its proposition be submitted in writing. The\r\nCommittee thereupon sent him the following request for a conference:\r\n\r\n      New York, August 26, 1919\r\n      Hon. Elbert H. Gary, Chairman Finance Committee,\r\n      United States Steel Corporation,\r\n      71 Broadway, New York City\r\n\r\n      _Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n      During a general campaign of organization and education\r\n      conducted under the auspices of the American Federation of\r\n      Labor, many thousands of men employed in the iron and steel\r\n      industry made application and were enrolled as members of\r\n      the various organizations to which they were assigned.\r\n\r\n      This work has been carried on to a point where we feel\r\n      justified in stating to you that we represent the sentiment\r\n      of the vast majority of the employees in this industry, and,\r\n      acting in behalf of them, we solicit of you that a hearing\r\n      be given to the undersigned Committee, who have been\r\n      selected by the duly accredited representatives of the\r\n      employees, to place before you matters that are of vital\r\n      concern to them, and concerning hours of labor, wages,\r\n      working conditions and the right of collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n      The committee called at your office at 3 P. M., Tuesday,\r\n      August 26, and requested a conference. We were advised by\r\n      your messenger that you wished to be excused from a personal\r\n      interview at this time and requested us to have our business\r\n      in writing and whatever matters we wished to submit would\r\n      be taken up by yourself and your colleagues and given\r\n      consideration.\r\n\r\n      Therefore we are submitting in brief the principal subjects\r\n      that we desired to have a conference on. The committee has\r\n      an important meeting in another city on Thursday next and\r\n      will leave New York at 5 o'clock on August 27, 1919. May we\r\n      respectfully request that your answer be sent before that\r\n      time to Mr. John Fitzpatrick, Continental Hotel, Broadway\r\n      and Forty-first Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n      Very truly yours,\r\n      John Fitzpatrick\r\n      D. J. Davis\r\n      Wm. Hannon\r\n      Edw. J. Evans\r\n      Wm. Z. Foster\r\n          Committee\r\n\r\nTo this letter Mr. Gary replied as follows:\r\n\r\n      UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION\r\n\r\n      Office of the Chairman,\r\n      New York, August 27, 1919\r\n      Messrs. John Fitzpatrick, David J. Davis, William\r\n      Hannon, Wm. Z. Foster, Edw. J. Evans, Committee\r\n\r\n      _Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\n      Receipt of your communication of August 26 instant is\r\n      acknowledged.\r\n\r\n      We do not think you are authorized to represent the\r\n      sentiment of a majority of the employees of the United\r\n      States Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries. We express no\r\n      opinion concerning any other members of the iron and steel\r\n      industry.\r\n\r\n      As heretofore publicly stated and repeated, our Corporation\r\n      and subsidiaries, although they do not combat labor unions\r\n      as such, decline to discuss business with them. The\r\n      Corporation and subsidiaries are opposed to the \"closed\r\n      shop.\" They stand for the \"open shop,\" which permits one to\r\n      engage in any line of employment whether one does or does\r\n      not belong to a labor union. This best promotes the welfare\r\n      of both employees and employers. In view of the well-known\r\n      attitude as above expressed, the officers of the Corporation\r\n      respectfully decline to discuss with you, as representatives\r\n      of a labor union, any matter relating to employees. In doing\r\n      so no personal discourtesy is intended.\r\n\r\n      In all decisions and acts of the Corporation and\r\n      subsidiaries pertaining to employees and employment their\r\n      interests are of highest importance. In wage rates, living\r\n      and working conditions, conservation of life and health,\r\n      care and comfort in times of sickness or old age, and\r\n      providing facilities for the general welfare and happiness\r\n      of employees and their families, the Corporation and\r\n      subsidiaries have endeavored to occupy a leading and\r\n      advanced position among employers.\r\n\r\n      It will be the object of the Corporation and subsidiaries to\r\n      give such consideration to employees as to show them their\r\n      loyal and efficient service in the past is appreciated, and\r\n      that they may expect in the future fair treatment.\r\n\r\n      Respectfully yours,\r\n      E. H. GARY, Chairman\r\n\r\nIn a last effort to prevail upon Mr. Gary to yield his tyrannical\r\nposition, the committee addressed him this further communication:\r\n\r\n      New York City, Aug. 27, 1919.\r\n      Hon. Elbert H. Gary, Chairman\r\n      Finance Committee, United States Steel Corporation,\r\n      71 Broadway, New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n      _Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n      We have received your answer to our request for a conference\r\n      on behalf of the employees of your Corporation, and we\r\n      understand the first paragraph of your answer to be an\r\n      absolute refusal on the part of your corporation to concede\r\n      to your employees the right of collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n      You question the authority of our committee to represent the\r\n      majority of your employees. The only way by which we can\r\n      prove our authority is to put the strike vote into effect\r\n      and we sincerely hope that you will not force a strike to\r\n      prove this point.\r\n\r\n      We asked for a conference for the purpose of arranging a\r\n      meeting where the questions of wages, hours, conditions of\r\n      employment, and collective bargaining might be discussed.\r\n      Your answer is a flat refusal for such conference, which\r\n      raises the question, if the accredited representatives of\r\n      your employees and the international unions affiliated with\r\n      the American Federation of Labor and the Federation itself\r\n      are denied a conference, what chance have the employees as\r\n      such to secure any consideration of the views they entertain\r\n      or the complaints they are justified in making.\r\n\r\n      We noted particularly your definition of the attitude of\r\n      your Corporation on the question of the open and closed\r\n      shop, and the positive declaration in refusing to meet\r\n      representatives of union labor. These subjects are matters\r\n      that might well be discussed in conference. There has not\r\n      anything arisen between your Corporation and the employees\r\n      whom we represent in which the question of \"the closed shop\"\r\n      has been even mooted.\r\n\r\n      We read with great care your statement as to the interest\r\n      the Corporation takes in the lives and welfare of the\r\n      employees and their families, and if that were true even in\r\n      a minor degree, we would not be pressing consideration,\r\n      through a conference, of the terrible conditions that exist.\r\n      The conditions of employment, the home life, the misery in\r\n      the hovels of the steel workers is beyond description. You\r\n      may not be aware that the standard of life of the average\r\n      steel worker is below the pauper line, which means that\r\n      charitable institutions furnish to the pauper a better\r\n      home, more food, clothing, light and heat than many steel\r\n      workers can bring into their lives upon the compensation\r\n      received for putting forth their very best efforts in the\r\n      steel industry. Surely this is a matter which might well be\r\n      discussed in conference.\r\n\r\n      You also made reference to the attitude of your Corporation\r\n      in not opposing or preventing your employees from joining\r\n      labor organizations. It is a matter of common knowledge that\r\n      the tactics employed by your Corporation and subsidiaries\r\n      have for years most effectively prevented any attempt at\r\n      organization by your employees. We feel that a conference\r\n      would be valuable to your Corporation for the purpose of\r\n      getting facts of which, judging from your letter, you seem\r\n      to be misinformed.\r\n\r\n      Some few days are still at the disposal of our committee\r\n      before the time limit will have expired when there will be\r\n      no discretion left to the committee but to enforce the\r\n      decree of your employees whom we have the honor to\r\n      represent.\r\n\r\n      We submit that reason and fairness should obtain rather than\r\n      that the alternative shall be compulsory upon us.\r\n\r\n      Surely reasonable men can find a common ground upon which we\r\n      can all stand and prosper.\r\n\r\n      If you will communicate with us further upon this entire\r\n      matter, please address your communication to the National\r\n      Hotel, Washington, D. C. where we will be Thursday and\r\n      Friday, August 28 and 29.\r\n\r\n      Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n      JOHN FITZPATRICK\r\n      D. J. DAVIS\r\n      WM. HANNON\r\n      EDW. J. EVANS\r\n      WM. Z. FOSTER\r\n          Committee\r\n\r\nNo reply came to the last letter. Mr. Gary, behind the smoke screen of\r\nhis hypocrisies about the \"open shop,\" was determined to have the strike\r\ngo on. But the committee, fully conscious of the tremendous\r\nresponsibility resting upon it, was equally decided to exhaust every\r\npossible means of adjustment before things came to a rupture. The\r\ncommitteemen went to Washington, appeared before the Executive Council\r\nof the A. F. of L., and received its endorsement and praise for the\r\nmanner in which the campaign had been conducted.\r\n\r\nMr. Gompers was delegated by the Council to go with the committee to\r\npresent the matter to President Wilson, and to request him to arrange a\r\nconference with the steel people.\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson was informed of the true situation in the steel\r\nindustry, that all the men were asking for was a conference at which to\r\npresent their grievances--absolutely no other demand having been made\r\nupon Mr. Gary--he immediately admitted the justice of the committee's\r\nposition. He stated frankly that he was entirely out of sympathy with\r\nemployers who refused to meet with representatives of their workers for\r\nthe purpose of bargaining collectively on labor conditions, and he\r\ndefinitely agreed to use all his influence privately to have Mr. Gary\r\nalter his decision and to arrange the conference. In order to give him a\r\nchance to work the unions withheld the setting of the strike date.\r\n\r\nA week passed, with no word from the President. Conditions in the steel\r\nindustry were frightful. The companies, realizing the importance of\r\nstriking the first blow, were discharging men by the thousands. The\r\nunions could wait no longer. They had to move or be annihilated. On\r\nSeptember 4, the National Committee met and sent to President Wilson,\r\nwho was on his ill-starred trip through the West advocating the League\r\nof Nations, the following telegram, in the meantime calling a meeting of\r\nthe Presidents of all the international unions co-operating in the steel\r\ncampaign to consider the critical situation:\r\n\r\n\r\n      Washington, September 4, 1919\r\n      Honorable Woodrow Wilson,\r\n      President of the United States,\r\n      Indianapolis, Ind., _en route_\r\n\r\n      The Executive Committee representing the various\r\n      international unions in the iron and steel industry met\r\n      today to consider the awful situation which exists in many\r\n      of the iron and steel industry centres. The coercion, the\r\n      brutality employed to prevent men and unions from meeting in\r\n      halls engaged, upon private property, in the open air, the\r\n      thuggery of the Corporations' emissaries, the wholesale\r\n      discharge of numbers of men for no other reason than the one\r\n      assigned, that they have become members of the unions, have\r\n      brought about a situation such that it is exceedingly\r\n      difficult to withhold or restrain the indignation of the men\r\n      and the resistance they declare it is their purpose to\r\n      present. The Executive Committee, relying upon the case as\r\n      presented to you last week and your earnest declaration to\r\n      endeavor to bring about a conference for the honorable and\r\n      peaceful adjustment of the matters in controversy, have thus\r\n      far been enabled to prevail upon the men not to engage in a\r\n      general strike. We cannot now affirm how much longer we will\r\n      be able to exert that influence; but we urge you, in the\r\n      great work in which you are engaged, to give prompt\r\n      attention to this most vital of issues; for if the men can\r\n      no longer be restrained it is impossible to foretell what\r\n      the future may hold in store for an industrial crisis which\r\n      may ensue and frustrate the project which you have worked at\r\n      for a peaceful and honorable adjustment of industrial\r\n      affairs in our country. A meeting of all the Presidents of\r\n      the twenty-four international unions in the steel industry\r\n      has been called to take place on Tuesday, September 9th in\r\n      Washington, D. C. to take such action as they deem\r\n      necessary. May we not have your reply on or before that time\r\n      as to whether or not a conference with the Steel Corporation\r\n      is possible.\r\n\r\n      SAMUEL GOMPERS\r\n      JOHN FITZPATRICK\r\n      D. J. DAVIS\r\n      WM. HANNON\r\n      EDW. J. EVANS\r\n      WM. Z. FOSTER\r\n\r\nThe international presidents met on September 9. A telegram from\r\nSecretary Tumulty was laid before them, to the effect that President\r\nWilson had not yet been successful in arranging the requested\r\nconference; that he was somewhat discouraged, but was continuing his\r\nefforts. The general opinion took this to be final, that Mr. Gary had\r\ndefinitely refused the President's request. But in order to make\r\nassurance doubly sure and to convince all involved that everything\r\npossible had been done to avert a break, the following further telegram\r\nwas sent to Mr. Wilson, over the objections of some who felt it was\r\npractically asking him to declare the strike:\r\n\r\n     Washington, September 9, 1919\r\n\r\n     Honorable Woodrow Wilson,\r\n     President of the United States,\r\n     St. Paul Hotel,\r\n     St. Paul, Minnesota\r\n\r\n     Secretary Tumulty's telegram of September fifth to Samuel\r\n     Gompers was read today at the meeting of the presidents of\r\n     the twenty-four international unions in the steel industry,\r\n     and given the most careful consideration. After a long and\r\n     earnest discussion of it the undersigned were instructed to\r\n     wire you requesting a more definite statement as to the\r\n     possibility of an early conference being arranged by your\r\n     efforts between the heads of the United States Steel\r\n     Corporation and of the unions involved. Large numbers of men\r\n     are being discharged and otherwise discriminated against and\r\n     abused, and it will be impossible to hold our men much longer\r\n     from defending themselves by striking unless some genuine\r\n     relief is vouchsafed them. Our meeting will remain in session\r\n     here for forty-eight hours awaiting your reply before taking\r\n     final action. Please send answer to John Fitzpatrick,\r\n     Chairman of National Committee, American Federation of Labor\r\n     Building, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n     JOHN FITZPATRICK\r\n     M. F. TIGHE\r\n     WM. HANNON\r\n     WM. Z. FOSTER\r\n\r\nOn the day following Secretary Tumulty's answer was laid on the table\r\nbefore the meeting, practically repeating what his first telegram had\r\nsaid. It held out no definite hope for a conference, neither did it\r\nsuggest any alternative.[10] Clearly the unions had to act. President\r\nGompers and others had warned of the great power of the Steel Trust and\r\nthe eagerness with which the employing class would unite to give\r\nOrganized Labor a heavy blow in the steel industry. The union\r\nrepresentatives keenly realized the gravity of the situation and their\r\nheavy responsibilities. It was in this frame of mind that they could see\r\nno honorable way out of the difficulty except to strike. Accordingly\r\nPresident Tighe of the Amalgamated Association moved that the strike be\r\nset for September 22. His motion was unanimously adopted. The die was\r\ncast. After telegraphing the strike order broadcast, the union men\r\nscattered to their respective posts to organize the walkout.\r\n\r\nThen came a bolt from the blue. Next morning the newspapers carried a\r\ntelegram from Secretary Tumulty to President Gompers requesting that the\r\nstrike be held off until after the Industrial conference, beginning\r\nOctober 6. The committeemen could hardly believe their eyes, because the\r\ntelegram they had received from Mr. Tumulty had said absolutely nothing\r\nabout postponing the strike. Besides, since the President had asked Mr.\r\nGary privately to grant his workers the conference they were seeking,\r\nand so gave him an opportunity to decline without publicity, it was\r\nincredible that he would publicly make a request upon the unions which\r\ninvolved their destruction, and which they would have openly to refuse,\r\nthus putting them in a bad light and giving their opponents a powerful\r\nweapon. But all doubts were set at rest by this communication from Mr.\r\nGompers:\r\n\r\n  AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR\r\n\r\n  Washington, D. C., Sept. 11, 1919\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Fitzpatrick, Chairman,\r\n  National Committee For Organizing Iron\r\n    and Steel Workers,\r\n  Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Mr. Fitzpatrick_:\r\n\r\n  This morning I received a telegram as follows:\r\n\r\n                            Dickinson, N. Dak., Sept. 10, 1919\r\n  Hon. Samuel Gompers,\r\n  President American Federation of Labor,\r\n  Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n  In view of the difficulty of arranging any present\r\n  satisfactory mediation with regard to the steel situation,\r\n  the President desires to urge upon the steel men, through\r\n  you, the wisdom and desirability of postponing action\r\n  of any kind until after the forthcoming Industrial conference\r\n  at Washington.\r\n\r\n  J. P. TUMULTY.\r\n\r\n  You are aware of the reason which prevented my\r\n  participating further, the past few days, in the conferences\r\n  with the representatives of the various national\r\n  and international unions involved in this question.\r\n\r\n  In transmitting the above to you (which I am doing\r\n  by long distance telephone from New York) I want to\r\n  express the hope that something can be done without\r\n  injury to the workers and their cause to endeavor to\r\n  conform to the wish expressed by the President; that\r\n  even though the corporations may endeavor to provoke\r\n  the men to action, that they may hold themselves in\r\n  leash and under self-control, consciously demonstrating\r\n  their stamina and willingness to abide by the justice of\r\n  their cause and that their rights will be finally protected.\r\n\r\n  Fraternally yours,\r\n  SAMUEL GOMPERS,\r\n  President\r\n  American Federation of Labor\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of this letter a meeting of the National Committee was\r\nat once called to consider the situation. And a serious one it was\r\nindeed. Before the Committee lay two requests to postpone the strike;\r\none from President Wilson, clear and categoric; the other from Mr.\r\nGompers, qualified by the hope that it could be done \"without injury to\r\nthe workers and their cause.\" To deny these powerful requests meant to\r\nbe accused, in the first instance, of hasty and disloyal action, and in\r\nthe second, of practical revolt against the officials of the A. F. of L.\r\nIt would be to start the strike under the handicap of an unduly hostile\r\npublic opinion. Yet to grant them meant ruin complete.\r\n\r\nConditions in the steel industry were desperate. Everywhere the\r\nemployers were making vigorous attacks on the unions. From Chicago,\r\nYoungstown, Newcastle, Steubenville, Wheeling, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and\r\nmany other points large numbers of men were being thrown out of work\r\nbecause of their union membership. Johnstown was a bleeding wound. In\r\nthe towns along the Monongahela river thousands of discharged men walked\r\nthe streets, and their number was daily being heavily increased.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this situation it would have been folly to have the steel\r\nworkers abandon their strike preparations, even if it could have been\r\ndone. It was like asking one belligerent to ground arms in the face of\r\nits onrushing antagonist. The employers gave not the slightest sign of a\r\ntruce. Long before anything could be hoped for from the Industrial\r\nconference, they would have cut the unions to pieces, had the workers\r\nbeen foolish enough to give them the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis the steel workers were determined not to do. Immediately after the\r\nstory got abroad that the strike might be postponed, they met in their\r\nunions and notified the National Committee that they were going to\r\nstrike on September 22, regardless of anything that body might do short\r\nof getting them definite concessions and protection. Many long weary\r\nmonths they had waited patiently, under the urgings of the organizers,\r\nfor a chance to redress their grievances. And now when they had built\r\ntheir organizations; taken their strike vote; received their strike call\r\nand were ready to deliver a blow at their oppressors, the opportunity of\r\na generation was at hand, and they were not going to see it lost. They\r\nwould not postpone indefinitely, and in all likelihood break up\r\naltogether, the movement they had suffered so much to build, in the\r\nvague hope that the Industrial conference, which they had no guarantee\r\nwould even consider their case, and which was dominated by their arch\r\nenemies, Gary and Rockefeller, would in some distant day do something\r\nfor them. Their determination to have the strike go on was intensified\r\nby the constant ding-donging of the Steel Trust propaganda in the mills\r\nto the effect that the A. F. of L. unions were cowardly and corrupt;\r\nthat they would make no fight for the steel workers, and that a\r\npostponement of the strike would be proof positive that they had sold\r\nout. Under such circumstances the workers could not consent to the\r\nwithholding of the strike. Practically all the steel districts in the\r\ncountry solemnly warned the National Committee that they would strike on\r\nSeptember 22, in spite of any postponement that was not based on\r\npositive assurances that justice would be done. The control of the\r\nsituation was in the hands of the rank and file.\r\n\r\nThe field secretaries and organizers present at the National Committee\r\nmeeting, men intimately acquainted with actual conditions, emphasized\r\nthe impossibility of postponement. Many of them, among whom were some of\r\nthe best and most conservative men in the whole campaign, declared that\r\nan attempt to delay the strike, merely upon the strength of possible\r\naction by the Industrial conference, would result in the swift\r\ndestruction of the movement under the worst of circumstances. The\r\nworkers would be bound to consider it a gigantic sell-out and to act\r\naccordingly. As for themselves, they declared they would have nothing to\r\ndo with it, and would be compelled to present their resignations the\r\nminute a motion to postpone prevailed. Dozens of them took this stand.\r\n\r\nTo the National Committee two courses were open: (1) It could postpone\r\nthe strike with the absolute certainty that it would break the steel\r\nmovement by so doing, because the strike would have gone ahead anyway in\r\na series of wild, uncontrolled, leaderless revolts, waged in an\r\natmosphere fatally charged with accusations of cowardice and graft. In\r\nall probability the A. F. of L. would suffer one of the worst defeats in\r\nits history, and gain such an evil reputation among the steel workers\r\nthat it could not approach them for many years, if ever, with an\r\norganization project. Or (2) it could go ahead with the strike, with a\r\nfighting chance to win. In any event, even if the strike were lost, it\r\nwould be through a clean fight and the honor of the movement would be\r\npreserved. The steel workers would be convinced that everything possible\r\nhad been done for them. Thus the unions would retain their confidence\r\nand be enabled to re-organize them at an early date.\r\n\r\nBetween certain, ignominious defeat and possible victory, or at the\r\nworst honorable failure, the National Committee had only one choice.\r\nPractically all the delegates present were of the opinion that the\r\nstrike had to go on. But some had to wire their international offices to\r\ncancel their instructions to vote for postponement. On September 18, D.\r\nJ. Davis, Assistant President of the Amalgamated Association moved that\r\nSeptember 22 be reaffirmed as the strike date. This was carried.[11]\r\nThen the Conference Committee addressed a long letter to President\r\nWilson, explaining in detail the situation as the union men saw it and\r\noutlining the reasons for not postponing the strike. The letter closed\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n      Mr. President, delay is no longer possible. We have tried to\r\n      find a way but cannot. We regret that for the first time\r\n      your call upon Organized Labor cannot meet with favorable\r\n      response. Believe us the fault is not ours. If delay were no\r\n      more than delay, even at the cost of loss of membership in\r\n      our organizations, we would urge the same to the fullest of\r\n      our ability, notwithstanding the men are set for an\r\n      immediate strike. But delay here means the surrender of all\r\n      hope. This strike is not at the call of the leaders, but\r\n      that of the men involved. Win or lose, the strike is\r\n      inevitable and will continue until industrial despotism will\r\n      recede from the untenable position now occupied by Mr. Gary.\r\n      We have faith in your desire to bring about a conference and\r\n      hope you will succeed therein. We fully understand the\r\n      hardships that meanwhile will follow and the reign of terror\r\n      that unfair employers will institute. The burden falls upon\r\n      the men, but the great responsibility therefor rests upon\r\n      the other side.\r\n\r\nAfter agreeing that all settlements made with the employers should cover\r\nall trades, and sending a letter to the independent steel companies\r\ninviting conferences with them, the meeting adjourned and the organizers\r\nand delegates left to make good the following strike call, of which\r\n200,000 copies, in seven languages, had been scattered broadcast\r\nthroughout the entire steel industry:\r\n\r\n      STRIKE SEPTEMBER 22, 1919\r\n\r\n      The workers in the iron and steel mills and blast furnaces,\r\n      not working under union agreements, are requested not to go\r\n      to work on September 22, and to refuse to resume their\r\n      employment until such time as the demands of the\r\n      organizations have been conceded by the steel corporations.\r\n\r\n      The union committees have tried to arrange conferences with\r\n      the heads of the steel companies in order that they might\r\n      present our legitimate demands for the right of collective\r\n      bargaining, higher wages, shorter hours and better working\r\n      conditions. But the employers have steadfastly refused to\r\n      meet them. It therefore becomes our duty to support the\r\n      committees' claims, in accordance with the practically\r\n      unanimous strike vote, by refusing to work in the mills on\r\n      or after September 22, until such time as our just demands\r\n      have been granted. And in our stoppage of work let there be\r\n      no violence. The American Federation of Labor has won all\r\n      its great progress by peaceful and legal methods.\r\n\r\n      IRON AND STEEL WORKERS! A historic decision confronts us. If\r\n      we will but stand together now like men our demands will\r\n      soon be granted and a golden era of prosperity will open for\r\n      us in the steel industry. But if we falter and fail to act\r\n      this great effort will be lost, and we will sink back into a\r\n      miserable and hopeless serfdom. The welfare of our wives and\r\n      children is at stake. Now is the time to insist upon our\r\n      rights as human beings.\r\n\r\n      STOP WORK SEPTEMBER 22\r\n\r\n      NATIONAL COMMITTEE\r\n      FOR ORGANIZING IRON AND STEEL WORKERS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Out of courtesy to the President the National Committee has never\r\nmade public these telegrams.\r\n\r\n[11] After he had been made fully acquainted with the situation Mr.\r\nGompers said before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor,\r\ninvestigating the steel strike: (Hearings, page 109) \"Notwithstanding\r\nwhat any of the officials of the trade unions would have done,\r\nregardless of what the Committee would have done, the strike would have\r\noccurred anyway, a haphazard, loose, disjointed, unorganized strike,\r\nwithout leadership, without consultation, without advice. It was simply\r\na choice whether the strike would take place under the guidance and\r\nleadership of men who have proven their worth, or under the leadership\r\nof some one who might spring up for the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE STORM BREAKS\r\n\r\n    THE STEEL TRUST ARMY--CORRUPT OFFICIALDOM--CLAIRTON--McKEESPORT\r\n      --THE STRIKE--SHOWING BY DISTRICTS--A TREASONABLE ACT--GARY\r\n      GETS HIS ANSWER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the memorable twenty-second of September approached a lurid and\r\ndramatic setting developed for the beginning of the great steel strike.\r\nEverywhere the steel companies made gigantic preparations to crush their\r\naspiring workers back to slavery. The newspapers shrieked revolution.\r\nThe whole country was a-tremble with anxiety and apprehension.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh was the storm center. There, in its stronghold, the Steel\r\nTrust went ahead with strike-breaking measures unprecedented in\r\nindustrial history. It provisioned and fortified its great mills and\r\nfurnaces, surrounding them with stockades topped off with heavily\r\ncharged electric wires, and bristling with machine guns. It assembled\r\nwhole armies of gunmen. Brute force was to be used in breaking the\r\nsolidarity of the workers. Said the New York _World_ editorially\r\nSeptember 22: \"In anticipation of the steel strike, what do we see? In\r\nthe Pittsburgh district thousands of deputy sheriffs have been recruited\r\nat several of the larger plants. The Pennsylvania State Constabulary\r\nhas been concentrated at commanding points. At other places the\r\nauthorities have organized bodies of war veterans as special officers.\r\nAt McKeesport alone 3,000 citizens have been sworn in as special police\r\ndeputies subject to instant call. It is as though preparations were made\r\nfor actual war.\"\r\n\r\nAlong the Monongahela river from Pittsburgh to Clairton, a distance of\r\ntwenty miles, there were not less than 25,000 armed men in the service\r\nof the Steel Trust. In the entire Pittsburgh district, practically all\r\nthe petty parasites who prey upon the steel workers--the professional\r\nand small business men--had been sworn in as deputies and furnished\r\nfirearms to defend their great overlord, to whom they all do\r\nunquestioning service no matter how dirty the job. During the strike\r\nSheriff Haddock of Allegheny county stated to the Senate Committee\r\ninvestigating the strike that there were 5,000 deputy sheriffs and 5,000\r\nstrikers in his jurisdiction, or one deputy for each striker. His totals\r\nshould have been multiplied by at least ten in each case; 50,000\r\ndeputies and 50,000 strikers would have been well below the mark. It is\r\nnoteworthy that although the danger of an uprising in the Pittsburgh\r\ndistrict was widely advertised no appeal was made for troops, nor was\r\nthere even any talk of an appeal. The reason was that the Steel Trust\r\nhad a vast army of its own, officered by its own officials, and it\r\nneeded no outside help.\r\n\r\nWestern Pennsylvania is controlled body and soul by the Steel Trust. The\r\nwhole district has the psychology of a company-owned town. All authority\r\ncenters in the steel industry. From there practically every institution\r\ntakes its orders. Local governmental agencies are hardly more than\r\npublic service departments of the Steel Trust. Their officials, city,\r\ncounty, state and federal, obey the mandates of the steel magnates just\r\nabout as readily and naturally as do the superintendents and mill\r\nbosses. No less than the latter they felt it to be their duty to break\r\nthe strike by whatever means their masters told them to use.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of the strike these lackey officials hastened _en\r\nmasse_ to the aid of the Steel Trust. Sheriff Haddock, besides swearing\r\nin an army of guards and turning them over to the steel companies to\r\ncarry out their plan of terrorism, issued a flaming proclamation\r\npractically setting up martial law and making it a riotous assembly for\r\nthree steel workers to meet together. Next day, September 21, the\r\norganizers tried to hold a meeting in North Clairton--with the Burgess'\r\npermission, and at a place on the public commons especially set aside by\r\nthe authorities for union meetings. About 3,000 steel workers gathered\r\nto hear the speakers. Everything was going as peacefully as a Sunday\r\nschool picnic, when suddenly a troop of State Constabulary appeared upon\r\nthe scene, and without a word of warning, rode full tilt into the crowd,\r\nclubbing and trampling men and women indiscriminately. They tore down\r\nand threw in the mud the American flag floating above the speakers'\r\nstand. Scores were arrested (including organizers J. B. Etchison and P.\r\nH. Brogan) and held for heavy bonds on charges of rioting.[12] Many\r\nwere seriously injured, but fearing to report their cases to the doctors\r\nand thus court arrest, as the latter were nearly all deputies, they\r\ncured themselves as best they could. This crying outrage was perpetrated\r\nunder the authority of the Sheriff's proclamation. It was endorsed and\r\nlauded by Governor Sproul, than whom the Steel Trust has no more willing\r\nchampion.\r\n\r\nAt the same hour as the Clairton outrage a similar attack was made on\r\nthe workers at Glassport, adjoining McKeesport. Not being allowed to\r\nmeet at the latter city the organizers had leased a plot of ground in\r\nGlassport and had been holding regular meetings there, with the full\r\nsanction of the local authorities. For the meeting in question they had\r\nan official permit. But just as it was about to begin the State\r\nConstabulary broke it up in true Cossack fashion, almost riding down the\r\nBurgess in so doing. They arrested all they could seize. These were held\r\nas rioters under bail of from $1,000 to $3,000 each. The venal\r\nPittsburgh papers screamed about the outbreaks that had been crushed by\r\nthe gallant State police, and praised them for their bravery in facing\r\nthe \"rioting mobs.\"\r\n\r\nDespite all these terroristic methods the Steel Trust could not break\r\nthe will of its workers. On September 22 they struck throughout the\r\nentire industry with a discipline and universality that will be\r\nremembered so long as steel is made in America. On Tuesday, the\r\ntwenty-third, 304,000 had quit their posts in the mills and furnaces.\r\nAll week their ranks were augmented until by September 30, there were\r\n365,600 on strike. It was a magnificent effort for freedom, and twice as\r\nbig a strike as this country had ever known. By cities and districts,\r\nthe numbers of strikers were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Pittsburgh                               25,000\r\n  Homestead                                 9,000\r\n  Braddock                                 10,000\r\n  Rankin                                    5,000\r\n  Clairton                                  4,000\r\n  Duquesne & McKeesport                    12,000\r\n  Vandergrift                               4,000\r\n  Brackenridge                              5,000\r\n  New Kensington                            1,100\r\n  Apollo                                    1,500\r\n  Leechburg                                 3,000\r\n  Donora & Monessen                        12,000\r\n  Johnstown                                18,000\r\n  Coatesville                               4,000\r\n  Youngstown district,\r\n    including Youngstown, E. Youngstown,\r\n    Struthers, Hubbard, Niles, Canton,\r\n    Alliance, Massillon, Warren, Farrell,\r\n    Newcastle, Sharon, Butler, etc.        70,000\r\n  Wheeling district                        15,000\r\n  Cleveland                                25,000\r\n  Steubenville district                    12,000\r\n  Chicago district,\r\n    including Gary, Joliet, DeKalb,\r\n    South Chicago, Indiana Harbor, East\r\n    Chicago, Hammond, Evanston, Sterling,\r\n    Peoria, Milwaukee, etc.                90,000\r\n  Buffalo district                         12,000\r\n  Pueblo                                    6,000\r\n  Birmingham                                2,000\r\n  5 Bethlehem Plants                       20,000\r\n                                          -------\r\n  Total                                   365,600\r\n\r\nThe shut-down was almost complete. Throughout the country the industry\r\nwas stricken with paralysis. On an average the strike was at least 90\r\nper cent. effective. In the great Chicago district practically all the\r\nmen struck, hamstringing the big plants in the various steel towns of\r\nthat section, Gary, Joliet, Indiana Harbor, South Chicago, etc. The\r\nholding of the organizations in this district for a year, in the face of\r\nSteel Trust opposition, by the organizers under Secretary Evans, and\r\nlater, De Young, was one of the most notable achievements of the whole\r\ncampaign. When the pent-up force was finally released it swept the\r\ndistrict like a flood, leaving hardly a wheel turning anywhere.\r\n\r\nYoungstown is another place where great difficulties had been\r\nencountered in the organizing work, the workers being deeply discouraged\r\nby recently lost local strikes, and the authorities at some points so\r\nhostile that it was impossible to hold meetings in the strategic places.\r\nBut so widespread was the discontent at the miserable working\r\nconditions, and so well had the district crew of organizers under\r\nSecretaries McCadden and Hammersmark done their work that when the\r\nstrike clarion sounded, the masses of steel workers responded almost to\r\na man. Trust plants and \"independents\" alike had to shut down. The steel\r\nworking population of the entire Mahoning Valley went on holiday. It was\r\na clean walkout. In the outer Youngstown district, as established by the\r\nNational Committee system, the companies, by the use of desperate\r\ntactics, succeeded in keeping some of their men at work; in Sharon,\r\nFarrell and Newcastle probably twenty per cent refused to obey the\r\nstrike call. But in Canton and Massillon, John Olchon and the other\r\norganizers brought all the important mills to a dead stop.\r\n\r\nWithout exception, the enormous Cleveland mills and furnaces shut down\r\ntight. In Johnstown the Cambria Company was so hard hit that, swallowing\r\nits pride, it had to ask the hated unions for a detachment of workers to\r\nprotect its plants. The Buffalo district men struck almost 100 per\r\ncent., after a bitter organizing campaign and an eight months' free\r\nspeech fight. The Wheeling and Steubenville districts' steel mills and\r\nblast furnaces were abandoned altogether by their crews. In Coatesville\r\nand Birmingham, the response was poor, in the first locality because of\r\ninsufficient organization; and in the second because of discouragement\r\ndue to a lost local strike the year before. But in far away Colorado,\r\nthe steel workers, hearkening to the voice of freedom abroad in the\r\nland, expressed their contempt for the company-union slavery of John D.\r\nRockefeller, Jr., by tieing up every department in his big Pueblo\r\nmills.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate Pittsburgh district, though here more strenuously\r\nopposed by the Steel Trust, the strike ranged from 75 to 85 per cent.\r\neffective. That it did not go as strong as other districts was purely\r\nbecause of the denial, by the companies and the authorities, of the\r\nworkers' rights to meet and to organize. In the \"Black Valley\" section\r\nof the district, comprising the towns lying along the Allegheny river,\r\nApollo, Vandergrift, Leechburg, Brackenridge, Natrona and New\r\nKensington, and notorious as the scene of the brutal murder of organizer\r\nMrs. Fannie Sellins, the strike went 90 per cent. or better; but in the\r\nMonongahela river section it was not so good. Of the steel towns in that\r\ndistrict, Donora and Monessen took the lead with a 100 per cent. strike.\r\nDue to the terrorism prevailing exact figures were almost impossible to\r\nget for the other towns, but according to the best information\r\nprocurable they averaged about as follows; Clairton 95, Braddock 90,\r\nHomestead 80, Rankin 85, McKeesport 70, and Duquesne 50 per cent. In\r\nPittsburgh itself all the larger mills and furnaces, except those of the\r\nJones and Laughlin Company, either suspended operations altogether or\r\nlost heavily of their employees during the first two days of the strike.\r\nThe Jones and Laughlin men had been profoundly discouraged by a lost\r\nstrike two years previously, and had responded poorly to the organizers'\r\nefforts. But when they saw the magnitude of the strike they took heart\r\nsomewhat, and by strenuous efforts in a rapid fire campaign, the\r\norganizers had at least 60 per cent. of them on strike by the end of the\r\nfirst week.\r\n\r\nIn the plants of the Bethlehem Steel Company the strike did not become\r\neffective until September 29. The cause was to be found in local\r\nconditions. In the early spring of 1918, before the National Committee\r\nbegan its campaign, ruthless exploitation by the company had resulted in\r\na strike of machine shop employees. The National War Labor Board settled\r\nthe strike, erecting a shop organization to handle grievances. In the\r\nmeantime the National Committee came into the field and began active\r\noperations. Up till this time the organized movement, led by David\r\nWilliams and Patrick Duffy, had been confined principally to the\r\nMachinists, Electrical workers and a few other skilled trades; but now\r\nit spread to the main body of the employees. To head it off the company\r\nproposed to the National Committee that a Rockefeller union be set up in\r\nthe plants. Naturally this was unacceptable. Then they offered to sign\r\nan agreement covering all their shipyard employees if the organization\r\nof their steel plants was given up, feeling no doubt that the shipyard\r\nboom was only temporary. For the National Committee, John Fitzpatrick\r\nspurned this shameful trade, and the organization campaign went on--with\r\nthe shipyard men getting their agreement later on just the same.\r\n\r\nTechnically the employees of the Bethlehem Company should have struck\r\nunder the first strike call, as they had no union agreement; but being\r\ntied up with futile negotiations under their \"collective bargaining\"\r\narrangement, they did not get out until the twenty-ninth. When they did\r\nstrike the response was not so good. A fair average for the plants in\r\nSouth Bethlehem, Steelton, Reading, Lebanon and Sparrows' Point would\r\nbe a 50 per cent. strike.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the strike affected practically the entire industry,\r\nseventy important steel centres being involved. About the only mills of\r\nconsequence to escape it were those located at Midland, Woodlawn, Lorain\r\nand Duluth. And the only reason for this was lack of sufficient\r\norganizers to cover them. It is noteworthy that the strike followed\r\nstrictly the lines of organization. In hardly a single instance did the\r\nunorganized go out spontaneously, even though they had previously been\r\nclamoring for the unions to help them. This tends to show how completely\r\nthe steel companies dominated their unorganized workers and how hard it\r\nwas for the latter to act in concert.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the great walkout was concentrated on the smelting and\r\nrolling branches of the steel industry. It had been the original\r\nintention to make the movement thoroughly industrial, taking in all the\r\nworkers from those who mine the coal and iron to those who transfer the\r\nfinished products to the railroad lines. But insufficient resources\r\ncompelled the modification of this program, and forced the unions to\r\nconfine their work principally to the blast furnaces and rolling mills.\r\nHowever, where the company mines or fabricating works lay close to the\r\ngeneral plants, or were part of them, the essentially industrial\r\ncharacter of the campaign manifested itself and these departments were\r\norganized along with the rest. In various places, including Gary,\r\nChicago, Homestead, etc., bridge, car, and other fabricating shops were\r\nan integral part of the drive. The iron miners working close in to\r\nBirmingham responded to some extent, but a big defeat of the local\r\nmetal trades in the mills a couple of years previously held them back\r\nfrom making a strong demonstration. The coal miners struck in several\r\nplaces. In Johnstown, 2,000 of them working in the Cambria Steel\r\nCompany's mines organized during the campaign, became affiliated with\r\nthe local mill workers' council, and walked out 100 per cent. on the\r\nhistoric twenty-second of September.\r\n\r\nAlthough the United States Steel Corporation was recognized as the arch\r\nenemy of the unions, the strike was not directed against it alone. Every\r\niron and steel mill and furnace in the country not working under union\r\nagreements was included. This meant at least 95 per cent. of the\r\nindustry, because the only agreements of any consequence were between\r\nsome of the smaller companies and the Amalgamated Association. A number\r\nof these concerns were affected also, their agreements relating only to\r\nskilled workers, and the plants having to close when the laborers\r\nstruck. This occurred quite extensively in the Cleveland, Youngstown and\r\nPittsburgh districts.\r\n\r\nConsidering the large number of them involved and their traditions of\r\nisolated action, the unions displayed reasonably good solidarity in\r\ngoing \"over the top\" against the Steel Trust. The battle line was far\r\nfrom perfect, however. Much harm was done the morale of the strikers by\r\nlocal unions here and there that were under the sway of ignorant\r\nblockheads or designing tools of the bosses, refusing to recognize the\r\nNational Committee's strike call and insisting upon getting instructions\r\nfrom their own headquarters, meanwhile scabbing it in the mills. And\r\nthe worst of it was that sometimes it was difficult, or even impossible\r\nto have the necessary instructions issued.\r\n\r\nFar more serious than this, however, was the action of the executive\r\nofficers of the International Union of Steam and Operating Engineers.\r\nJust as the strike was about to begin President Snellings and Secretary\r\nComerford sharply condemned it by letter and through the press, urging\r\ntheir men to stay at work upon the flimsy pretext that the President's\r\nindustrial conference would attend to their interests. Roused to\r\nindignation by this cold-blooded course, the local unions of engineers,\r\nalmost without exception, repudiated their international misleaders and\r\nstuck with the rest of the steel workers. After President Gompers had\r\nbeen quoted in the newspapers as pledging the support of the A. F. of L.\r\nto the strike (two days after it started) and Labor generally had shown\r\nits determination to stick by the steel workers, the officers of the\r\nEngineers' international were compelled to publicly endorse the strike.\r\nBut throughout its duration they nevertheless privately encouraged their\r\nstrategically situated tradesmen to return to work, thus doing\r\nincalculable harm when the strikers had begun to weaken a little. This\r\nplain case of official scabbery was inspired by a jurisdictional dispute\r\nbetween the engineers and the electrical workers over the disposition to\r\nbe made of electrical crane-men signed up in the campaign. Because they\r\ncould not have their unreasonable way in the matter, the officials of\r\nthe engineers deliberately knifed the strike and lent aid and comfort\r\nto the bitterest opponents of Organized Labor on this planet. To such\r\nextremes will union men go in internecine wars over trade demarcations.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of opposition, blundering and treachery, the steel workers\r\nhad spoken. Mr. Gary was answered. Previous to the strike, he declared\r\nthat the unions represented only an insignificant minority of his men,\r\nthe great bulk of his working force being satisfied. He compelled the\r\nCommittee to show its credentials. Result: 365,600 steel workers laid\r\ndown their tools. This estimated total has never been disputed by the\r\nsteel companies. Here and there, in some individual town or district,\r\nthey pointed out a figure occasionally as being excessive; but although\r\nimportuned by newspaper men to do so, they never ventured to issue a\r\nstatement of the number on strike at all points. The reason was that\r\nthey feared to print the grand total which even their lying press bureau\r\nwould have to admit. Word came to the Committee from reliable sources\r\nthat the steel manufacturers considered the union figure well within the\r\nreal total.\r\n\r\nWhile not accurately ascertainable, the number of Mr. Gary's employees\r\nactually taking part in the strike may be closely approximated. Mr. Gary\r\nstated to the Senate Committee that the total number employed by the\r\nUnited States Steel Corporation in the departments affected by the\r\nstrike was 201,065. Against this number should be checked off about half\r\nof the total number of strikers, or 182,500. This is based upon the\r\ntheory that the official U. S. Steel Corporation plants form\r\napproximately 50 per cent. of the industry, and that the strike was\r\njust as effective against them as against those of any other company. It\r\nis not asserted that these figures are absolutely accurate; but they\r\nwill serve to indicate that the claim of a 90 per cent. strike in the\r\nplants of the Steel Corporation is a fair one. It is exceedingly\r\ndoubtful if as many as 10 per cent. of Mr. Gary's employees remained at\r\ntheir posts and failed to heed the strike call. Fully 125,000 of them\r\nwere members of the unions before the strike started, and most of the\r\nrest would have been also, had they dared brave the anger of their\r\nbosses.\r\n\r\nThe great steel strike thoroughly exposed the hypocrisies of Mr. Gary\r\nand his ilk that in some mysterious way labor policies and conditions in\r\nthe steel industry depend upon the wishes of the body of the workers. It\r\nmade plain that in the autocratic system now prevailing the democratic\r\nprinciples of majority and minority do not enter. It is a case pure and\r\nsimple of the absolute sway of property rights over human rights. A\r\nhandful of social parasites hidden away in Wall street, with no other\r\ninterest in the steel industry than to exploit it, settle arbitrarily\r\nthe vital questions of wages, hours and working conditions, while the\r\nenormous mass of the workers, actual producers whose very lives are\r\ninvolved, have no say whatsoever. No matter how bitter their grievances,\r\nwhen they raise their voice to ask redress, they are discharged,\r\nblacklisted, starved, beaten, jailed and even shot, until they bend the\r\nknee again and yield to the will of their industrial masters.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] In this connection occurred one of the finest incidents in the\r\nstrike: Wm. J. Brennan, an able, conscientious attorney of Pittsburgh,\r\nand one of the counsel who defended the Homestead strikers in 1892, went\r\nto Clairton to get the \"rioters\" released on bonds. But such a state of\r\nterror existed that no one dared to go their bail. Thereupon, Mr.\r\nBrennan himself, without knowing a single one of the defendants, but\r\nsmarting under the injustice of it all, pledged his entire property\r\nholdings, amounting to $88,000, to get them set free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nGARYISM RAMPANT\r\n\r\n    THE WHITE TERROR--CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS DENIED--UNBREAKABLE\r\n      SOLIDARITY--FATHER KAZINCY--THE COSSACKS--SCIENTIFIC\r\n      BARBARITY--PROSTITUTED COURTS--SERVANTS REWARDED\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of the steel strike to occur in the midst of the\r\npost-war reaction, which still persists unabated, and which constitutes\r\nthe most shameful page in American history. Ours are days when the\r\norganized employers, inspired by a horrible fear of the onward sweep of\r\nrevolution in Europe and the irresistible advance of the labor movement\r\nin this country, are robbing the people overnight of their most precious\r\nrights, the fruits of a thousand years of struggle. And the people, not\r\nyet recovered from war hysteria and misled by a corrupt press, cannot\r\nperceive the outrage. They even glory in their degradation. Free speech,\r\nfree press, free assembly, as we once knew these rights, are now things\r\nof the past. What poor rudiments of them remain depend upon the whims of\r\na Burleson, or the rowdy element of the American Legion. Hundreds of\r\nidealists, guilty of nothing more than a temperate expression of their\r\nhonest views, languish in prison serving sentences so atrocious as to\r\nshock the world--although Europe has long since released its war and\r\npolitical prisoners. Working class newspapers are raided, denied the use\r\nof the mails and suppressed. Meetings are broken up by Chamber of\r\nCommerce mobs or thugs in public office. The right of asylum is\r\ngone--the infamous Palmer is deporting hundreds who dare to hold views\r\ndifferent from his. The right of the workers to organize is being\r\nsystematically curtailed; and crowning shame of all, workingmen can no\r\nlonger have legislative representatives of their own choosing. In a\r\nword, America, from being the most forward-looking, liberty-loving\r\ncountry in the world, has in two short years become one of the most\r\nreactionary. We in this country are patiently enduring tyranny that\r\nwould not be tolerated in England, France, Italy, Russia or Germany. Our\r\ngreat war leaders promised us the New Freedom; they have given us the\r\nWhite Terror.\r\n\r\nRealizing full well the reactionary spirit of the times, the steel\r\ncompanies proceeded safely to extremes to crush the steel strike, dubbed\r\nby them an attempt at violent revolution. To accomplish their end they\r\nstuck at nothing. One of their most persistent and determined efforts\r\nwas to deprive the steel workers of their supposedly inalienable right\r\nto meet and talk together. Throughout the strike, whenever and wherever\r\nthey could find municipal or court officials willing to do their\r\nbidding, the steel barons abolished the rights of free speech and free\r\nassembly, so precious to strikers. Few districts escaped this evil, but\r\nas usual, Pennsylvania felt the blow earliest and heaviest. Hardly had\r\nthe strike started when the oily Schwab prohibited meetings in\r\nBethlehem; the Allegheny and West Penn Steel Companies did the same at\r\nNatrona, jailing organizer J. McCaig for \"inciting to riot\"; in the\r\nSharon-Farrell district the steel workers, denied their constitutional\r\nrights in their home towns, had to march several miles over into Ohio\r\n(America they called it) in order to hold their meetings.\r\n\r\nAlong the Monongahela river the shut-down was complete. Following\r\nSheriff Haddock's proclamation and the \"riots\" at Clairton and\r\nGlassport, it was only a few days until the city and borough officials\r\nhad completely banned strike meetings in all the territory from\r\nCharleroi to Pittsburgh. The unions' free-speech, free-assembly victory\r\nof the past summer was instantly cancelled. For forty-one miles through\r\nthe heart of America's steel industry, including the important centers\r\nof Monessen, Donora, Clairton, Wilson, Glassport, McKeesport, Duquesne,\r\nHomestead, Braddock, Rankin, etc., not a meeting of the steel workers\r\ncould be held. Even in Pittsburgh itself meetings were prohibited\r\neverywhere except in Labor Temple. The steel-collared city officials\r\nnever could quite muster the gall to close Labor's own building--or\r\nperhaps because it is so far from the mills and so poorly situated for\r\nmeetings they felt it to be of no use to the strikers. Thus the Steel\r\nTrust gave its workers a practical demonstration of what is meant by the\r\nphrase, \"making the world safe for democracy.\"\r\n\r\nNot only were mass meetings forbidden, but so also were regular business\r\nmeetings under the charters of the local unions. To test out this\r\nparticular usurpation, Attorney W. H. Rubin, then in charge of the\r\nstrike's legal department and possessed of a keener faith in\r\nPennsylvania justice than the Strike committee had, keener probably than\r\nhe himself now has, prayed the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas to\r\nenjoin Mayor Babcock and other city officials from interfering with a\r\nlocal union of the Amalgamated Association holding its business meetings\r\non the south side of the city where its members lived and where several\r\nlarge mills are located. At the hearing the Mayor and Chief of Police\r\nfreely admitted that there had been no violence in the strike, and even\r\ncomplimented the men on their behavior, but they feared there might be\r\ntrouble and so forbade the meetings. The honorable Judges Ford and\r\nShafer agreed with them and denied the writ, saying among other things:\r\n\r\n      It is the duty of the Mayor and Police Department to\r\n      preserve the peace, and it must be sometimes necessary for\r\n      that purpose to prevent the congregating in one place of\r\n      large numbers of people such as might get beyond the control\r\n      of the Police Department, and it must be left to the\r\n      reasonable discretion of the officers charged with keeping\r\n      the peace when such intervention is made.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the sacred right of the workers to meet together depends\r\nupon the arbitrary will of any politician who may get into the office\r\ncontrolling the permits. Shortly before Judges Ford and Shafer handed\r\ndown this noble conception of free assembly, Judge Kennedy of the\r\nAllegheny County Court, ruling on the appeal of Mother Jones, J. L.\r\nBeaghen, J. M. Patterson and Wm. Z. Foster in the Duquesne free speech\r\ncases of several weeks prior to the strike, had this to say:\r\n\r\n      It cannot be questioned that the object of these\r\n      meetings--increasing the membership in the American\r\n      Federation of Labor--is a perfectly lawful one, but the\r\n      location of the meetings in the Monongahela valley, built up\r\n      as it is for mile after mile of an unbroken succession of\r\n      iron and steel mills, and thickly populated with iron\r\n      workers, many of whom obviously are not members of this\r\n      association, and among whom, on both sides, there are, in\r\n      all probability, some who upon the occasion of meetings such\r\n      as these purported to be, might through excitement\r\n      precipitate serious actions of which the consequences could\r\n      not be foreseen and might be disastrous, presents questions\r\n      which are sufficient to cause the court to hesitate before\r\n      interfering with the exercise of discretion on the part of\r\n      the Mayor in refusing to permit such meetings at this time.\r\n\r\nThe Court is still hesitating to interfere with Mayor Crawford's\r\ntyranny, and the defendants had to pay $100 and costs each for trying to\r\nhold a meeting on ground they had leased. One would think that the\r\nremedy in the case conjured out of thin air by the learned judge (for in\r\nthe thousands of meetings held in the steel campaign he cannot point to\r\none incident of violence) would be for the local authorities to provide\r\nample police protection to insure order. But no, in Pennsylvania the\r\nthing to do is to set aside the constitutional rights of the workers.\r\nWould such action be taken in the case of members of a Chamber of\r\ncommerce? Wouldn't the governor, rather, order out the state troops, if\r\nnecessary, to uphold their right of assembly?\r\n\r\nIn the hope of getting some relief, or at the least some publicity about\r\nthe unbearable situation, a committee of 18 local labor men,\r\nrepresenting the largest trade unions in Western Pennsylvania, went to\r\nWashington and presented to the Allegheny County congressional\r\ndelegation a petition expressing contempt for the judges and other\r\nofficials in their part of the State and asking Congress to give them\r\nthe justice these men refused to mete out. Surely, the Allegheny County\r\ncongressmen were exactly the ones to bring the Steel Trust to time. With\r\na grand flourish they introduced a resolution into the House calling for\r\nan investigation--then they forgot all about it.\r\n\r\nThe official tyranny and outlawry along the Monongahela was so bad that\r\nthe Pennsylvania Federation of Labor had to voice its protest. On\r\nNovember 1-2 it held a special convention in Pittsburgh, attended by\r\nseveral hundred delegates. A resolution was adopted demanding that\r\nprotection be given the rights of the workers, and that if the\r\nauthorities failed to extend this protection, \"the Executive Council of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Federation of Labor shall issue a call for a State-wide\r\nstrike, when in its judgment it is necessary to compel respect for law\r\nand the restoration of liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and of the State of Pennsylvania.\" For this action\r\nPresident Jas. H. Maurer of the Federation was hotly assailed and even\r\nmenaced with lynching by the lawless business interests.\r\n\r\nBy some inexplicable mental twist the ex-union man Burgess of Homestead\r\neventually allowed the unions to hold one mass meeting each week--to\r\nthis day the only ones permitted in the forty-one miles of Monongahela\r\nsteel towns. They were under the supervision of the State police. At\r\neach meeting a half dozen of these Cossacks, in full uniform, would sit\r\nupon the platform as censors. Only English could be spoken. As the\r\nsaying was, all the organizers were permitted to talk about was the\r\nweather. When one touched on a vital strike phase a Cossack would yell\r\nat him, \"Hey, cut that out! You're through, you--! Don't ever come back\r\nhere any more.\" And he never could speak there again.\r\n\r\nJudging from past experiences the strike in the Pittsburgh district\r\nshould have been impossible under such hard circumstances. With little\r\nor no opportunity to meet for mutual encouragement and enlightenment,\r\nthe strikers, theoretically, should have been soon discouraged and\r\ndriven back to work. But they were saved by their matchless solidarity,\r\nbred of a deep faith in the justice of their cause. In the black,\r\nCossack-ridden Monongahela towns there were thousands of strikers who\r\nwere virtually isolated, who never attended a meeting during the entire\r\nstrike and seldom if ever saw an organizer or read a strike bulletin,\r\nyet they fought on doggedly for three and one-half months, buoyed up by\r\na boundless belief in the ultimate success of their supreme effort. Each\r\nfelt himself bound to stay away from the mills, come weal or come woe,\r\nregardless of what the rest did. These were mainly the despised\r\nforeigners, of course, but their splendid fighting qualities were a\r\nnever-ending revelation and inspiration to all connected with the\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark night of oppression a bright beacon of liberty gleamed\r\nfrom Braddock. There the heroic Slavish priest, Reverend Adelbert\r\nKazincy, pastor of St. Michel's Roman Catholic church, bade defiance to\r\nthe Steel Trust and all its minions. He threw open his church to the\r\nstrikers, turned his services into strike meetings, and left nothing\r\nundone to make the men hold fast. The striking steel workers came to his\r\nchurch from miles around, Protestants as well as Catholics. The\r\nneighboring clergymen who ventured to oppose the strike lost their\r\ncongregations,--men, women and children flocked to Father Kazincy's, and\r\nall of them stood together, as solid as a brick wall.\r\n\r\nReverend Kazincy's attitude aroused the bitterest hostility of the steel\r\ncompanies. They did not dare to do him bodily violence, nor to close his\r\nchurch by their customary \"legal\" methods; but they tried everything\r\nelse. Unable to get the local bishop to silence him, they threatened\r\nfinally to strangle his church. To this the doughty priest replied that\r\nif they succeeded he would put a monster sign high up on his steeple:\r\n\"This church destroyed by the Steel Trust,\" and he would see that it\r\nstayed there. When they tried to foreclose on the church mortgage, he\r\npromptly laid the matter before his heterogeneous congregation of\r\nstrikers, who raised the necessary $1200 before leaving the building and\r\nnext day brought in several hundred dollars more. Then the companies\r\ninformed him that after the strike no more Slovaks could get work in\r\nthe mills. He told them that if they tried this, he would do his level\r\nbest to pull all the Slovaks out of the district (they are the bulk of\r\nthe mill forces) and colonize them in the West. The promised blacklist\r\nhas not yet materialized.\r\n\r\nFather Kazincy and the clergymen who worked with him, notable among whom\r\nwas the Reverend Molnar, a local Slavish Lutheran minister, constituted\r\none of the great mainstays of the strike in their district. They are men\r\nwho have caught the true spirit of the lowly Nazarene. The memory of\r\ntheir loyal co-operation will long live green in the hearts of the\r\nPittsburgh district steel strikers.\r\n\r\nA description of the repressive measures taken by the Steel Trust\r\nagainst its workers during the early period of the strikes necessarily\r\nrelates almost entirely to Western Pennsylvania. With few exceptions,\r\nthe other districts were in a deadlock. So tightly were the mills shut\r\ndown that the companies could hardly stir. It took them several weeks to\r\nget their stricken fighting machinery in motion again. But it was\r\ndifferent in Western Pennsylvania, in what we call the greater\r\nPittsburgh district; that has always been the key to the whole industry,\r\nand there, from the very first, the steel companies made a bitter fight\r\nto control the situation and to break the strike. The tactics used there\r\nare typical in that they came to be universally applied as the strike\r\ngrew older, the degree of their application depending upon the amount of\r\ncontrol exercised by the Steel Trust in the several localities.\r\n\r\nTo carry on the terror so well begun by the suppression of free speech\r\nand free assembly, the Steel Trust turned loose upon the devoted\r\nstrikers in Western Pennsylvania the great masses of armed thugs it had\r\nbeen recruiting since long before the strike. These consisted of every\r\nimaginable type of armed guard, official and unofficial, except\r\nuniformed troops. There were State Constabulary, deputy sheriffs, city\r\npolice, city detectives, company police, company detectives, private\r\ndetectives, coal and iron police, ordinary gunmen, armed\r\nstrike-breakers, vigilantes, and God knows how many others. These\r\nlegions of reaction, all tarred with the same brush--a servile,\r\nmercenary allegiance to the ruthless program of the Steel Trust--vied\r\nwith each other in working hardships upon the steel workers. In this\r\nshameful competition the State Constabulary stood first; for downright\r\nvillainy and disregard of civil and human rights, these so-called\r\nupholders of law and order easily outdistanced all the other plug-uglies\r\nassembled by the Steel Trust. They merit our special attention.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania State Constabulary dates from 1905, when a law was\r\nenacted creating the Department of State Police. The force is modelled\r\nsomewhat along the lines of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the\r\nCanadian Northwest Mounted Police. The men are uniformed, mounted,\r\nheavily armed and regularly enlisted. For the most part they consist of\r\nex-United States army men. At present they number somewhat less than the\r\namount set by law, 415 officers and men. Their ostensible duty is to\r\npatrol the poorly policed rural sections of the state, and this they do\r\nwhen they have nothing else to take up their time. But their real\r\nfunction is to break strikes. They were organized as a result of the\r\nfailure of the militia to crush the anthracite strike of 1902. Since\r\ntheir inception they have taken an active part in all important\r\nindustrial disturbances within their jurisdiction. They are the heart's\r\ndarlings of Pennsylvania's great corporations. Labor regards them with\r\nan abiding hatred. Says Mr. Jas. H. Maurer (_The Cossack_, page 3):\r\n\r\n      The \"English Square\" is the only open-field military\r\n      formation of human beings that has ever been known to\r\n      repulse cavalry. All other formations go down before the\r\n      resistless rush of plunging beasts mounted by armed men, mad\r\n      in the fierce excitement induced by the thundering gallop of\r\n      charging horses. A charge by cavalry is a storm from\r\n      hell--for men on foot. A cavalry-man's power, courage and\r\n      daring are strangely multiplied by the knowledge that he\r\n      sits astride a swift, strong beast, willing and able to\r\n      knock down a dozen men in one leap of this terrible rush.\r\n      Hence, the Cossacks, the mounted militiamen--for crushing\r\n      unarmed, unmounted groups of men on strike.\r\n\r\nBut the State Police do not confine themselves merely to the crude\r\nbusiness of breaking up so-called strike riots. Their forte is\r\nprevention, rather than cure. They aim to so terrorize the people that\r\nthey will cower in their homes, afraid to go upon the streets to\r\ntransact necessary business, much less to congregate in crowds. They\r\nplay unmercifully upon every fear and human weakness. They are skilled,\r\nscientific terrorists, such as Czarist Russia never had.\r\n\r\nOn a thousand occasions they beat, shot, jailed or trampled steel\r\nworkers under their horses' hoofs in the manner and under the\r\ncircumstances best calculated to strike terror to their hearts. In\r\nBraddock, for instance, a striker having died of natural causes, about\r\ntwo hundred of his fellows assembled to accompany the body to the\r\ncemetery. To stop this harmless demonstration all the State Police\r\nneeded to do was to send a word to the union. But such orderly,\r\nreasonable methods do not serve their studied policy of frightfulness.\r\nTherefore, without previously informing the strikers in any way that\r\ntheir funeral party was obnoxious, the Cossacks laid in wait for the\r\nprocession, and when it reached the heart of town, where all Braddock\r\ncould get the benefit of the lesson in \"Americanism,\" they swooped down\r\nupon it at full gallop, clubbing the participants and scattering them to\r\nthe four winds.\r\n\r\nSimilar outrageous attacks occurred not once, but dozens of times. Let\r\nFather Kazincy speak of his experiences:\r\n\r\n      Braddock, Pa., Sept. 27, 1919\r\n      W. Z. Foster,\r\n      Pittsburgh, Pa.,\r\n\r\n      _Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n      The pyramidal impudence of the State Constabulary in denying\r\n      charges of brutal assaults perpetrated by them upon the\r\n      peaceful citizens of the borough of Braddock prompts me to\r\n      send a telegram to the Governor of Pennsylvania, in which I\r\n      have offered to bring forth two specific cases of bestial\r\n      transgression of their \"calling.\"\r\n\r\n      On Monday last at 10 A. M. my congregation, leaving\r\n      church, was suddenly, without any cause whatever, attacked\r\n      on the very steps of the Temple of God, by the Constables,\r\n      and dispersed by the iron-hoofed Huns. Whilst dispersing\r\n      indignation and a blood frenzy swayed them, a frenzy\r\n      augmented by that invisible magnetic force, the murmuring,\r\n      raging force of 3,000 strong men. One could feel that\r\n      helpless feeling of being lifted up by some invisible force,\r\n      forced, thrown against the flux of raging, elemental passion\r\n      of resentment, against the Kozaks of this State.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, it was the most magnificent display of\r\n      self-control manifested by the attacked ever shown anywhere.\r\n      They moved on, with heads lowered and jaws firmly set, to\r\n      submit. Oh, it was great; it was magnificent. They, these\r\n      husky, muscle-bound Titans of raw force walked home ... only\r\n      thinking, thinking hard. Oh, only for one wink from some\r\n      one, would there be a puddle of red horseblood mixed with\r\n      the human kind.\r\n\r\n      But no. We want to win the strike. We want to win the\r\n      confidence of the public.\r\n\r\n      Tuesday afternoon the little babies of No. 1 were going to\r\n      the school. They loitered for the school bell to summon\r\n      them. And here come Kozaks. They see the little innocents\r\n      standing on the steps of the school-house, their parents on\r\n      the opposite side of the street. What a splendid occasion to\r\n      start the \"Hunkey's\" ire. Let us charge their babies--that\r\n      will fetch them to an attack upon us.\r\n\r\n      They did. But the \"Hunkey\" even at the supreme test of his\r\n      cool-headedness, refused to flash his knife to save his\r\n      babies from the onrush of the cruel horses' hoofs.\r\n\r\n      I am relating to you, Mr. Foster, things as they happened.\r\n      You may use my name in connection with your charges against\r\n      the Constabulary.\r\n\r\n      Sincerely yours,\r\n      REV.

M. he\r\n      went to visit his cousin on Fifth Avenue, Homestead, Pa.:\r\n      that he did in fact visit his cousin and after leaving the\r\n      house of his cousin was accosted on the street by a member\r\n      of the State Police who commanded him, the deponent, to\r\n      enter a certain house, which house was not known to the\r\n      deponent; that deponent informed said State Policeman that\r\n      he, deponent, did not live in the house indicated by the\r\n      State Policeman; nevertheless, the said State Policeman\r\n      said, \"It makes no difference whether you live in there or\r\n      not, you go in there anyhow\"; thereupon in fear of violence\r\n      deponent did enter the said house, which house was two doors\r\n      away from the house of the cousin of deponent; that after a\r\n      time deponent came out of the house into which he had been\r\n      ordered, thereupon the same State Policeman returned and\r\n      ordered deponent to re-enter the house aforesaid and upon\r\n      again being informed by deponent that he, the deponent, did\r\n      not live in said house, the said State Policeman forthwith\r\n      arrested the deponent and brought him to Homestead police\r\n      station, and at a hearing at said station before the burgess\r\n      was fined the sum of nine dollars and sixty-five cents,\r\n      which amount was paid by deponent.\r\n\r\n      JOHN BODNAR\r\n\r\n      Sworn to and subscribed before me\r\n      this first day of October, 1919.\r\n      A. F. Kaufman, Notary Public.\r\n\r\nHere is what happened in the house into which Bodnar was driven:\r\n\r\n      STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA  }\r\n      COUNTY OF ALLEGHENY    }  SS.\r\n\r\n      Before me, the undersigned authority, personally appeared\r\n      Steve Dudash, who being duly sworn according to law deposes\r\n      and says that he resides at 541 E. 5th Ave., Homestead, Pa.;\r\n      that on Tuesday September 23, 1919, in the afternoon of said\r\n      day, his wife, Mary Dudash, was severely scalded, burned,\r\n      and injured by reason of a sudden fright sustained when a\r\n      State Policeman forced John Bodnar into the home of the\r\n      deponent and his wife, Mary Dudash; that said Mary Dudash,\r\n      the wife of the deponent, was in a very delicate condition\r\n      at the time of the fright and injury complained of, caused\r\n      by the State Police and that on Sunday, Sept. 28, 1919,\r\n      following the date in question, namely the 23rd, the said\r\n      Mary Dudash, wife of deponent, gave birth to a child; that\r\n      on account of the action of the State Police in forcing John\r\n      Bodnar with terror into the home of deponent and his wife,\r\n      Mary Dudash, she, the said Mary Dudash, wife of the\r\n      deponent, has been rendered very sick and has suffered a\r\n      nervous collapse and is still suffering from the nervous\r\n      shock sustained, on account of the action of the State\r\n      Police, above referred to.\r\n\r\n      STEVE DUDASH\r\n\r\n      Sworn to and subscribed before me\r\n      this first day of October, 1919\r\n      A. F. Kaufman, Notary Public.\r\n\r\nWhen on a mission of terrorism the first thing the State Troopers do is\r\nto get their horses onto the sidewalks, the better to ride down the\r\npedestrians. Unbelievable though it may seem, they actually ride into\r\nstores and inner rooms. Picture the horror a foreign worker and his\r\nfamily, already badly frightened, at seeing a mounted policeman crashing\r\ninto their kitchen. The horses are highly trained. Said an N. E. A. news\r\ndispatch, Sept. 26th, 1919:\r\n\r\n      Horses of the Pennsylvania State Constabulary are trained\r\n      not to turn aside, as a horse naturally will do, when a\r\n      person stands in its way, but to ride straight over any one\r\n      against whom they are directed. Lizzie, a splendid black\r\n      mare ridden by Trooper John A. Thorp, on duty at Homestead,\r\n      uses her teeth as well as her heels when in action. Her\r\n      master will sometimes dismount, leaving Lizzie to hold a\r\n      striker with her strong jaws, while he takes up the pursuit\r\n      of others on foot.\r\n\r\nIf this is thought to be an overdrawn statement, read the following\r\naffidavit:\r\n\r\n      Butler, Pa., October 3, 1919\r\n\r\n      I, Jacob Sazuta,\r\n      21 Bessemer Ave.,\r\n      Lyndora, Pa.\r\n\r\n      Commenced work for the Standard Steel Car Company in\r\n      September, 1913, as laborer. About October 1916 was promoted\r\n      to car fitter in the erection department; in February, 1919,\r\n      was then taken and placed as a wheel roller, and I worked in\r\n      this capacity until August 6th, 1919 [the date the steel\r\n      strike began there].\r\n\r\n      On August 25, after receiving my pay, I was standing looking\r\n      in a store window, when State Trooper No. 52 rode his horse\r\n      upon me, THE HORSE STEPPING ON MY LEFT FOOT. Trooper No. 52\r\n      ordered me to move on, BUT AS THE HORSE WAS STANDING ON MY\r\n      FOOT I COULD NOT MOVE. He then struck me across the head\r\n      with his club, cutting a gash in the left side of my head\r\n      that took the doctor three stitches to close up the wound.\r\n      After hitting me with his club, he kept chasing me with his\r\n      horse.\r\n\r\n      JACOB SAZUTA\r\n\r\n      Sworn and subscribed before me\r\n      this third day of October, 1919.\r\n      E. L. Cefferi, Notary Public.\r\n\r\nA few affidavits, and extracts from affidavits, taken at random from\r\namong the hundreds in possession of the National Committee, will\r\nindicate the general conditions prevailing in the several districts:\r\n\r\n      Clairton, Pa.\r\n\r\n      John Doban, Andy Niski and Mike Hudak were walking home\r\n      along the street when the State Police came and arrested the\r\n      three, making ten holes in Mike Hudak's head. Were under\r\n      arrest three days. Union bailed them out, $1,000.00 each.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Butler, Pa., Oct. 3, 1919.\r\n\r\n      I, James Torok, Storekeeper,\r\n      103 Standard Ave.,\r\n      Lyndora, Pa.,\r\n\r\n      On about August 15, 1919, I saw State Troopers chase a\r\n      crippled man who could not run as fast as his horse, and run\r\n      him down, the horse bumping him in the back with his head,\r\n      knocked him down. Later three men were coming to my store to\r\n      buy some things; the State Troopers ran their horses right\r\n      on them and chased them home. One of the men stopped and\r\n      said: \"I have to go to the store,\" and the Trooper said:\r\n      \"Get to hell out of here, you sons -- ----, or I will kill\r\n      you,\" and started after them again, and the people ran home\r\n      and stayed away from the store.\r\n\r\n      JAMES TOROK\r\n\r\n      Sworn to and subscribed before me\r\n      this 3rd day of October, 1919.\r\n      E.

Two State\r\n      Policemen brusquely ordered them home and when they did not\r\n      move fast enough to suit, followed them home, forced himself\r\n      into the house and struck affiant with a stick on the head\r\n      and grabbed her by the hair and pulled her from the kitchen\r\n      and forced her into a patrol wagon and took her to the\r\n      borough jail.... Sworn to before Henry Fusarini, Notary\r\n      Public, October 11, 1919.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Newcastle, Pa.\r\n\r\n      John Simpel,\r\n      1711 Morris Ave.,\r\n      Newcastle.\r\n\r\n      On Sept. 22, about 5.30 P. M. he was walking along\r\n      towards his home on Moravia Street. Hearing shots fired he\r\n      stopped in the middle of the street and was instantly struck\r\n      by bullets three times, one bullet going through his leg,\r\n      one through his finger, while the third entered his back and\r\n      went through his body, coming out through his abdomen. The\r\n      shots were fired from inside the gates of the Carnegie Steel\r\n      Company's plant. Mr. Simpel believes the shots were fired\r\n      from a machine gun, because of their rapid succession. He\r\n      fell on the ground and lay there for about ten minutes,\r\n      until he was picked up by a young boy.... He is now totally\r\n      disabled. He has a wife and a child and is 48 years of\r\n      age....\r\n\r\n      JAS. A. NORRINGTON, Secretary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Farrell, Pa.\r\n\r\n      ... There were four men killed here, one in a quarrel in a\r\n      boarding house and three by the Cossacks. Half a dozen were\r\n      wounded, one of them a woman. She was shot in the back by a\r\n      Cossack, while on her way to the butcher shop....\r\n\r\n      S. COATES, Secretary.\r\n\r\nMany hundreds of similar cases could be cited. In the steel strike a\r\nscore were killed, almost all on the workers' side; hundreds were\r\nseriously injured, and thousands unjustly jailed. To the State\r\nConstabulary attaches the blame for a large share of this tyranny. The\r\neffect of their activities was to create a condition in Western\r\nPennsylvania, bordering on a reign of terror. Yet it is extremely\r\ndifficult to definitely fasten their crimes upon them. No matter how\r\ndastardly the outrage, when the Steel Trust cracks its whip the local\r\nauthorities and leading citizens come forth with a mass of affidavits,\r\n\"white-washing\" the thuggery in question, and usually sufficing to cast\r\nserious doubts on the statements of the few worker witnesses courageous\r\nenough to raise their voices. What is to be thought of the following\r\nincident?\r\n\r\nTestifying before the Senate Committee investigating the strike, Mr.\r\nGompers related how, in an organizing campaign in Monessen, Pa. several\r\nyears ago, A. F. of L. organizer Jefferson D. Pierce was bludgeoned by\r\nSteel Trust thugs, receiving injuries that resulted in his death. Mr.\r\nGompers had his facts straight. Yet the very next day, Mr. Gary,\r\ntestifying before the same Committee, produced a sworn statement from\r\nthe son of Mr. Pierce containing the following assertions:\r\n\r\n      I was with my father the night he received his injuries in\r\n      Monessen, Pa., and wish to state very emphatically that his\r\n      injury was not caused by any one connected with the United\r\n      States Steel Corporation. On the contrary, it was caused by\r\n      a member of the I. W. W. organization from out of town, who\r\n      was sent there at the time to create trouble, as the I. W.\r\n      W. organization was then trying to gain control of the\r\n      organizing situation. I wish again most emphatically to\r\n      refute Mr. Gompers' statement that this injury was caused by\r\n      some one connected with the United States Steel Corporation.\r\n\r\nUpon being questioned, Mr. Gary \"thought\" that Mr. Pierce is employed at\r\nWorcester, Mass. by the American Steel and Wire Company, a subsidiary of\r\nthe U. S. Steel Corporation.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, in the steel strike the photographer secured a\r\nproof of State Police brutality which the most skilled Steel Trust\r\napologists cannot explain away--a picture of the typically vicious\r\nassault upon Mr. R. Dressel, a hotel keeper of 532 Dickson St. (foreign\r\nquarter), Homestead, Pa. I quote from the latter's statement in\r\nconnection therewith:\r\n\r\n      I, Rudolph Dressel, of the aforesaid address, do hereby make\r\n      this statement of my own volition and without solicitation\r\n      from any one. That on the 23rd day of September I was\r\n      standing in front of my place of business at the aforesaid\r\n      address and a friend of mine, namely, Adolph Kuehnemund,\r\n      came to visit and consult me regarding personal matters. As\r\n      I stood as shown in the picture above mentioned with my\r\n      friend, the State Constabulary on duty in Homestead came\r\n      down Dickson St. They had occasion to ride up and down the\r\n      street several times and finally stopped directly in front\r\n      of me and demanded that I move on. Before I had time to\r\n      comply I was struck by the State Policeman. (The attitude of\r\n      said Policeman is plainly shown in the aforesaid picture,\r\n      and his threatening club is plainly seen descending towards\r\n      me.)\r\n\r\n      My friend and I then entered my place of business and my\r\n      friend a few minutes afterwards looked out on the street\r\n      over the summer doors. The policeman immediately charged him\r\n      and being unable to enter my place of business on horseback,\r\n      dismounted and entered into my place of business on foot.\r\n\r\n      My friend being frightened at what had happened to me\r\n      retired to a room in the rear of my place of business. The\r\n      Policeman entered this room, accompanied by another State\r\n      Police, and without cause, reason or excuse, struck my\r\n      friend and immediately thereafter arrested him. I was\r\n      personally present at his hearing before Burgess P. H.\r\n      McGuire of the above city, at which none of the aforesaid\r\n      policemen were heard or even present. Burgess asked my\r\n      friend what he was arrested for, and my friend referred to\r\n      me inasmuch as he himself did not know. The Burgess\r\n      immediately replied, \"We have no time to hear your\r\n      witnesses,\" and thereupon levied a fine of $10.00 and costs\r\n      upon him. My friend having posted a forfeit of $25.00, the\r\n      sum of $15.45 was deducted therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe State Constabulary were sent, unasked for, into the quiet steel\r\ntowns for the sole purpose of intimidating the strikers. The following\r\ntook place at the meeting of the Braddock Borough Council, October 6:\r\n\r\n      Mr. Verosky: (County detective and council member) \"Mr.\r\n      Chairman, the citizens of the borough wish to know by whose\r\n      authority the State Constabulary was called into Braddock to\r\n      take up their quarters here and to practically relieve the\r\n      police of their duties, by patrolling the streets on foot,\r\n      mounted, and always under arms.\"\r\n\r\n      Mr. Holtzman: (President of Council) \"I surely do not know\r\n      who called them into town, but were I the Burgess, I would\r\n      make it my business to find out, in view of the fact that\r\n      the Constabulary is neither wanted nor needed here.\"\r\n\r\n      Mr. Verosky: \"Well, in that case, the Burgess may throw some\r\n      light on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n      Mr. Callahan: (Burgess) \"The question comes to me as a\r\n      surprise and I am sure that I don't know by whose authority\r\n      the Constabulary was called in.\"\r\n\r\nEverything was calm in Braddock until the State Police came in. Then the\r\ntrouble began. It was the same nearly everywhere. The arrival of these\r\nmen was always the signal for so-called riots, and wholesale clubbing,\r\nshooting and jailing of strikers.\r\n\r\nGreat praise has been poured upon the State Constabulary for their\r\nsupposedly wonderful bravery and efficiency, because a few hundred of\r\nthem, scattered thinly through a score of towns, have been able\r\napparently to overawe many thousands of strikers. But the credit is\r\nundeserved. In strikes they always form, in point of actual weight, an\r\ninsignificant part of the armed forces arrayed against the strikers. For\r\ninstance, in a steel town, during the strike, there would usually be a\r\ndozen or so State Police and from 3,000 to 4,000 deputy sheriffs,\r\ncompany police, etc. The latter classes of gunmen make up the body of\r\nthe real repressive force; the State Police are merely raiders. It is\r\ntheir particularly dirty job to harass the enemy; to break the strike\r\nby scientifically bulldozing the strikers in their homes and on the\r\nstreets. Thus they are thrown into the limelight, while the company\r\nthugs remain in comparative obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe State Police feel reasonably sure of their skins when carrying on\r\ntheir calculated campaigns of terrorism, for behind them are large\r\nnumbers of armed guards of various sorts ready to spring to their\r\nsupport at an instant's notice, should the workers dare to resist them.\r\nBesides, they know they have _carte blanche_ to commit the greatest\r\nexcesses, since the highest state officials, not to speak of local\r\ncourts and other authorities, give them undivided support. They are\r\nabove the law, when the rights of the workers are concerned. Moreover,\r\nthey realize fully that they can depend upon trade-union leaders to hold\r\nthe strikers in check from adopting measures of retaliation. Few of them\r\nare hurt during their depredations. Once in a while, however, they drive\r\ntheir victims to desperation and get themselves into trouble.\r\n\r\nFor example, a few days after a fight in Farrell, Pa., that cost the\r\nstrikers two dead and a dozen seriously wounded, the local secretary\r\nthere, S. Coates, was on his way to Ohio to hold a meeting, when the\r\ndelivery truck upon which he was riding overturned, rendering him\r\nunconscious. He woke up in a Sharon hospital. The six beds adjoining his\r\nwere occupied by Cossacks, injured in the riot started by themselves in\r\nFarrell. The public knew nothing of their injuries, it being the regular\r\nthing to suppress such facts, in order to surround the dreaded Cossacks\r\nwith a reputation for invulnerability. The way the latter \"get even\"\r\nfor their casualties is to victimize and outrage as many workers as they\r\nthink necessary to balance the score. But such methods cannot go on\r\nindefinitely. It will be marvellous, indeed, if some day the State\r\nConstabulary, with their policy of deliberate intimidation, are not the\r\nmeans of causing riots such as this country has not yet experienced in\r\nlabor disputes. Not always will the unions be able to hold their men as\r\nsteady in the face of brutal provocation as they did in the recent steel\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nHand in glove with the Cossacks in their work of terrorizing\r\nPennsylvania's steel towns went the less skilful but equally vicious\r\ncompany police, gunmen, deputy sheriffs, etc., many of whom, ex-service\r\nmen, disgraced their uniforms by wearing them on strike duty. Nor were\r\nthe city police, save for a few honorable exceptions here and there,\r\nappreciably better. As for the police magistrates, almost to a man they\r\nseconded unquestioningly the work of the sluggers. In fact, all the\r\nforces of \"law and order\" in Western Pennsylvania, official and\r\nunofficial, worked together like so many machines--in the interest of\r\ntheir powerful master, the Steel Trust.\r\n\r\nMany of the armed guards were murderous criminals; penitentiary birds\r\nscraped together from the slums of the great cities to uphold Garyism by\r\ncrushing real Americanism. They took advantage of the strike situation\r\nand the authority vested in them to indulge in an orgy of robbery and\r\nthievery. Dressed in United States army uniforms and wearing deputies'\r\nbadges, they even robbed strikers in broad daylight on the main\r\nstreets. And if the latter dared to protest they were lucky not to be\r\nbeaten up, jailed and fined for disorderly conduct. The strike\r\ncommittees have records of many such cases. And worse yet, more than one\r\nstriker was robbed while he was in jail. Liberty bonds and cash\r\ndisappeared frequently. To lose watches, knives, etc., was a common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nPicketing was out of the question, although, like many other liberties\r\ndenied the steel strikers, it is theoretically permitted under the laws\r\nand court rulings of Pennsylvania. Strikers foolhardy enough to attempt\r\nit were usually slugged and arrested. Even the right to strike was\r\nvirtually overthrown. The practice was for several company and city\r\npolice, without warrants, to seek a man in his home, crowd in and demand\r\nhis return to work. Upon refusal he would be arrested and fined from $25\r\nto $100 for disorderly conduct. Then he would be offered his money back,\r\nif he would agree to be a scab. This happened not once, but scores, if\r\nnot hundreds of times. Like practices were engaged in almost everywhere.\r\nIn Monessen State Police and other \"peace officers\" would regularly\r\nround up batches of strikers before the mill gates. Those that agreed to\r\ngo to work were set free; the rest were jailed. Many were kept overnight\r\nin an old, unlighted building and threatened from time to time with\r\nhanging in the morning, if they would not become scabs. This was\r\nparticularly terrifying, as the strikers, mainly foreigners knowing\r\nlittle of their supposed legal rights, had very good reason to think\r\nthat State Police, as well as armed thugs, would go to any extreme\r\nagainst them. In Pittsburgh itself, the decisive question asked petty\r\nprisoners in the police courts was, \"Are you working?\" Those who could\r\nshow that they were strike-breakers were released forthwith; while those\r\nwho admitted being on strike were usually found guilty without further\r\nquestioning. Throughout the whole district, to be a scab was to be a\r\npeaceable, law abiding citizen; to be a striker was criminal.\r\n\r\nThe courts put every obstacle in the way of the strikers getting\r\njustice. In those towns where it was possible to get lawyers at all no\r\ncourtesies were extended the representatives of the men. They were\r\ndenied the right of cross-examination; could not get the necessary\r\npapers for appeals, and in some cases were actually ordered out of\r\ncourt. Attorney Roe was arrested in McKeesport for attempting to confer\r\nwith a dozen of his clients in a private hall. The strikers were held\r\nunder excessive bail and fined shamefully for trivial charges, to\r\ndisprove which they were often denied the right to produce witnesses.\r\nThe following quotations from a report by J. G. Brown, formerly\r\npresident of the International Union of Timber Workers, who was a\r\ngeneral organizer in the Pittsburgh district and later director of the\r\nlegal department of the National Committee, will give an indication of\r\nthe situation and some of the reasons therefor:\r\n\r\n      ... The next day came the strike. The jails swarmed with\r\n      arrested strikers. This was especially true in the Soho\r\n      district of Pittsburgh, where are located the main entrances\r\n      of the National Tube Works, and the Jones and Laughlin\r\n      Company's plants. In the afternoon two organizers who were\r\n      walking down the street in this section were taken to jail,\r\n      held without bail on charges of being \"suspicious persons.\"\r\n      Information was given to us that only the Supt. of Police\r\n      had authority to fix bail. He could not be located. Indeed,\r\n      that these men were arrested at all was learned only through\r\n      the newspapers. They were not allowed to communicate with\r\n      their friends or attorneys. Attorney Brennan eventually\r\n      found the Chief of Police and went bail for the men.\r\n\r\n      Deciding to utilize the right of picketing, which the laws\r\n      of the state permit, a group of men were chosen for this\r\n      work, captains assigned and stationed at the entrances of\r\n      the mills in Soho. No sooner had they arrived there than\r\n      they were hustled right on to jail, which was already filled\r\n      to overflowing. Many were convicted on disorderly conduct\r\n      charges; others were warned of dire things in store for\r\n      them, and all were advised to return to their work in the\r\n      mills.\r\n\r\n      Many women and young girls were among the victims of police\r\n      brutalities in the Soho district. Located in this section\r\n      were only city policemen; the State Constabulary did not\r\n      \"work\" much within the city limits. Much wonder was created\r\n      by the undiminishing brutality of the Soho police. The\r\n      Central Labor Council of Pittsburgh tried to have the City\r\n      Council inaugurate an investigation of the shameful state of\r\n      affairs, but nothing could be done.\r\n\r\n      Shortly after the strike was called off the Pittsburgh\r\n      papers carried a story to the effect that the city policemen\r\n      working in the Soho district had been \"paid\" $150 each by\r\n      the National Tube Co. It was stated also that the same men\r\n      were paid a like amount by the Jones and Laughlin Company.\r\n      This explains, perhaps, why justice was so blind in this\r\n      section.\r\n\r\n      On the opposite side of the Monongahela river, where the\r\n      Jones and Laughlin Company has other immense works the\r\n      police were equally bad, the police magistrate even worse.\r\n      The Police Commissioner was boss of the situation. And now\r\n      come the Pittsburgh papers with the story that this very\r\n      Commissioner, Peter P. Walsh, has made application to be\r\n      retired from the Pittsburgh police force on half pay in\r\n      order that he might accept the appointment as chief of the\r\n      mill police of the Jones and Laughlin Company. The half pay\r\n      allowance gives, according to reports, $1800 per year. The\r\n      new position Mr. Walsh is to fill is popularly understood to\r\n      carry with it a salary of $5000 per year.... The Central\r\n      Labor Council is making an effort to have this matter\r\n      investigated, but without serious hope of success.\r\n\r\nWhen a labor committee demanded that Mayor Babcock of Pittsburgh\r\ninvestigate the situation, the honorable gentleman refused. He admitted\r\nthat the action of the steel companies was ill-advised; the money should\r\nhave been given to the pension fund, instead of to a few men; however,\r\nthe matter was now past history, and there was nothing to be added to\r\nthe fair name of Pittsburgh by airing it in public. The Mayor admitted,\r\nthough, that he would object to having labor unions raise funds to pay\r\npolicemen to favor them during strikes. So reason public officials in\r\nthe steel districts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuppression of the rights of free speech and free assembly; gigantic\r\norganized campaigns of outlawry by the State Police and armies of\r\nselected plug-uglies; subornation and intimidation of city, county,\r\nstate and federal officials and police; prostitution of the\r\ncourts--these are some of the means used to crush the strike of the\r\nsteel workers, and to force these over-worked, under-paid toilers still\r\ndeeper into the mire of slavery. And the whole monstrous crime was\r\nhypocritically committed in the name of a militant, 100 per cent.\r\nAmericanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nEFFORTS AT SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n    THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCE--THE SENATE COMMITTEE\r\n      --THE RED BOOK--THE MARGOLIS CASE--THE INTERCHURCH WORLD\r\n      MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon October 6 the National Industrial Conference opened its sessions in\r\nWashington, D. C. This body was called together by President Wilson to\r\nmake an effort to solve the pressing labor difficulties confronting the\r\ncountry, and was the one, pending whose deliberations the steel workers\r\nhad been asked to postpone their strike. It was a three-party\r\narrangement, Capital, Labor and the Public being represented. Naturally\r\nit was only advisory in character; and under the rules adopted all\r\naction taken, not relating merely to methods of procedure, had to have\r\nthe endorsement of all three sections, each of which voted as a unit in\r\naccordance with the majority sentiment of its members.\r\n\r\nThe Conference met in the midst of a tense situation. The steel industry\r\nwas almost completely paralysed; the miners were just about to launch\r\ntheir national general strike; the railroaders were in a foment of\r\ndiscontent, and many other large and important sections of workers were\r\ndemanding better conditions. Capital and Labor were arrayed against\r\neach other as never before. Both appeared determined to fight; Capital\r\nin a bitter, revengeful spirit to oust Labor from the favorable position\r\nwon during the war, and Labor in a decided effort to hold what it had\r\nand to make more winnings to offset the rapidly mounting cost of living.\r\nThe United States seemed upon the brink of an industrial war.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the touchstone of the Conference, the measure by\r\nwhich all its activities were gauged, was the steel strike. It was clear\r\nthat its attitude towards this great issue would settle its general\r\npolicy. This was felt by all parties to the Conference, even though some\r\nhated the thought. The labor delegation, headed by Samuel Gompers,\r\nprecipitated matters by introducing, by previous arrangement with the\r\nNational Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers, the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, The Nation-wide strike now in progress in\r\n      the steel industry of America affects not only the men and\r\n      women directly concerned, but tends to disturb the relations\r\n      between employers and workers throughout our industrial\r\n      life; and\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, This conference is called for the purpose\r\n      of stabilizing industries and bringing into being a better\r\n      relation between employers and employees; and\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, Organized Labor wishes to manifest its\r\n      sincere and fair desire to prove helpful in immediately\r\n      adjusting this pending grave industrial conflict; therefore,\r\n      be it,\r\n\r\n      RESOLVED, That each group comprising this\r\n      conference select two of its number and these six so\r\n      selected to constitute a committee to which shall be\r\n      referred existing differences between the workers and\r\n      employers in the steel industry for adjudication and\r\n      settlement. Pending the findings of this committee, this\r\n      conference requests the workers involved to return to work\r\n      and the employers to re-instate them in their former\r\n      positions.\r\n\r\nThis resolution provoked a storm of opposition from the reactionary\r\nemployers, who, headed by Mr. Gary (ironically seated with John D.\r\nRockefeller, Jr., as a representative of the Public) insisted that the\r\nConference ignore the steel strike situation altogether, its purpose\r\nbeing, according to them, not the settlement of existing disputes, but\r\nthe formulation of principles and plans which would provide for the\r\nprevention of such disputes in the future. Finally, seeing that if they\r\ninsisted upon their resolution it would wreck the Conference, the\r\nworkers held it in abeyance temporarily and submitted the following:\r\n\r\n      The right of wage earners to organize without\r\n      discrimination, to bargain collectively, to be represented\r\n      by representatives of their own choosing in negotiations and\r\n      adjustments with employers in respect to wages, hours of\r\n      labor and relations and conditions of employment, is\r\n      recognized.\r\n\r\nSuch a mild proposition as this would hardly meet with serious\r\nopposition in a similar conference in any other important country than\r\nours. All over Europe it would be far too conservative to fit the\r\nsituation. In England, for example, the British Industrial Conference\r\nrecently adopted the following:\r\n\r\n      The basis of negotiation between employers and work people\r\n      should, as is presently the case in the chief industries of\r\n      the country, be the full, frank acceptance of the employers'\r\n      organizations on the one hand, and trade unions on the other\r\n      as the recognized organizations to speak and act on behalf\r\n      of their members.\r\n\r\nAnd just across our border, in Canada, this advanced conception was\r\nformulated but a few months before:\r\n\r\n      On the whole we believe the day has passed when any employer\r\n      should deny his employees the right to organize. Employers\r\n      claim that right for themselves and it is not denied by the\r\n      workers. There seems to be no reason why the employer should\r\n      deny like rights to those who are employed by him. Not only\r\n      should employees be accorded the right of organizing, but\r\n      the prudent employer will recognize such organization and\r\n      will deal with the duly accredited representatives thereof\r\n      in all matters relating to the interests of the employees\r\n      when it is fairly established to be representative of them\r\n      all.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Gary and his associates care nothing about the reputation of\r\nAmerica as a progressive, liberty-loving country. They have their\r\nprerogatives, and they intend to exercise them, cost what it may. They\r\norganize as they see fit and pick out such representatives as they will;\r\nbut by virtue of their economic strength they deny to their workers\r\nthese same rights. So they voted down Labor's collective bargaining\r\nresolution, and at the same time the one providing for a settlement of\r\nthe steel strike. The employers insisted upon absolute rule by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis action discredited the Conference, and sentenced it to dissolution.\r\nBy its refusal to meet the great steel strike issue the Conference\r\nshowed that it had neither the will nor the power to settle industrial\r\ndisputes. Labor, openly denied the fundamental right of organization,\r\ncould no longer sit with it. The workers' representatives, therefore,\r\ntook the only honorable course left to them; they withdrew, allowing the\r\nwhole worthless structure to collapse. Said Mr. Gompers in his final\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n      Gentlemen, I have sung my swan song in this conference. You\r\n      have, by your action--the action of the employers'\r\n      group--legislated us out of this conference. We have nothing\r\n      further to submit; and with a feeling of regret we have not\r\n      been enabled with a clear conscience to remain here longer.\r\n      We have responsibilities to employees and workers and those\r\n      dependent upon them. We must fulfill these obligations.\r\n\r\nThus ingloriously ended the Conference upon which the steel workers had\r\nbeen asked to hang all their hopes. Even with powerful organizations\r\nintact and with their industry almost entirely at a standstill, the\r\nlatter could get no consideration from it. What, then, would have been\r\ntheir fate if they had postponed the strike? With their forces\r\nshattered, half of their men being on strike and the rest at work\r\nthoroughly disgusted, they would have been helpless and unable to strike\r\nin any event. They would have been absolutely at the mercy of the\r\nemployers. And any one who may imagine that the latter would have done\r\nanything short of giving the steel workers their _coup de grace_ at the\r\nConference is an optimist indeed. The steel strike was a clean fight\r\nand an honorable defeat for Labor. Its bad effects will soon wear off.\r\nBut it would have been a ruinous calamity, with ineradicable harm, had\r\nthe strike been postponed for the sake of the ill-fated Industrial\r\nConference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPursuant to a resolution adopted by the Senate on September 23, in the\r\nwhite heat of the strike excitement, the Committee on Education and\r\nLabor was instructed to investigate the steel strike and to report back\r\nto the Senate as soon as possible. Accordingly this Committee held\r\nsittings in Washington and Pittsburgh, hearing about one hundred\r\nwitnesses all told. Its active members were Senators Kenyon (Chairman),\r\nMcKellar, Walsh (Mass.), Sterling and Phipps.\r\n\r\nFor the workers Samuel Gompers, John Fitzpatrick, M. F. Tighe and many\r\norganizers and strikers testified, setting forth in detail the\r\ngrievances and demands of the men. For the steel companies came the\r\nusual crop of strike-breakers and company officials, pliable city\r\nauthorities and business men from the steel towns. The star witness was\r\nJudge Gary, who presented practically the entire case for the whole\r\nsteel industry. It is noteworthy that with the exception of one minor\r\nhothead, the so-called \"independents\" made no defense before the\r\ncommittee. They left it all to their master, the United States Steel\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\nMr. Gary was a good witness. Not for him were the antiquated blusterings\r\nof a \"divine-right\" Baer or a \"public-be-damned\" Vanderbilt. He used the\r\nmodern method,--a mass of silky hypocrisies and misrepresentations for\r\nthe public, to cover up the mailed fist he has for his workers. He was\r\nsuave, oily, humble, obliging, persuasive, patriotic. He pictured the\r\nsteel industry as a sort of industrial heaven and the U. S. Steel\r\nCorporation as a beneficent institution, leading even the trade-union\r\nmovement in reform work.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Mr. Gary's peculiar notions of the \"open shop,\" minority\r\nrule by the unions, etc., set forth afresh by him at the strike\r\nhearings, are discussed quite generally throughout this book, there is\r\nno need to review them again here. We will note his testimony no more\r\nthan to give the facts of the death of Mrs. Fannie Sellins, of whose\r\nmurder he was so anxious to clear the Steel Trust.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fannie Sellins was an organizer for the United Mine Workers of\r\nAmerica, stationed in the notorious, anti-union Black Valley district\r\nalong the Allegheny river. An able speaker, and possessed of boundless\r\ncourage, energy, enthusiasm and idealism, she was a most effective\r\nworker. Due largely to her efforts many thousands of miners and\r\nmiscellaneous workers in this hard district were organized. She was the\r\nvery heart of the local labor movement, which ranked second to none in\r\nPennsylvania for spirit and progress. When the steel campaign began,\r\nMrs. Sellins threw herself whole-heartedly into it. She worked\r\nindefatigably. More than any other individual she was responsible for\r\nthe unionization of the big United States Steel Corporation mills at\r\nVandergrift, Leechburg and New Kensington, as well as those of the\r\nso-called independent Allegheny and West Penn Steel Companies at\r\nBrackenridge. The results secured by her will compare favorably with\r\nthose of any other organizer in the whole campaign.\r\n\r\nBy her splendid work in behalf of the toilers Mrs. Sellins gained the\r\nundying hatred of the untamed employers in the benighted Black Valley\r\ndistrict. Open threats were made to \"get\" her. The opportunity came on\r\nAugust 26, 1919, when she was deliberately murdered under the most\r\nbrutal circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe miners of the Allegheny Coal and Coke Company were on strike at West\r\nNatrona. The mine is situated in the mill yard of the Allegheny Steel\r\nCompany and furnishes fuel for that concern. All was going peacefully\r\nwhen a dozen drunken deputy sheriffs on strike duty, led by a mine\r\nofficial, suddenly rushed the pickets, shooting as they came. Joseph\r\nStrzelecki fell, mortally wounded. Mrs. Sellins, standing close by,\r\nrushed first to get some children out of danger. Then she came back to\r\nplead with the deputies, who were still clubbing the prostrate\r\nStrzelecki, not to kill him. What happened then is told in the _New\r\nMajority_ (Chicago) of September 20:\r\n\r\n      ---- ----, the mine official, snatched a club and felled the\r\n      woman to the ground.\r\n\r\n      This was not on company ground, but just outside the fence\r\n      of a friend of Mrs. Sellins.\r\n\r\n      She rose and tried to drag herself toward the gate.\r\n\r\n      ---- shouted: \"Kill that -- -- -- -- -- --!\"\r\n\r\n      Three shots were fired, each taking effect.\r\n\r\n      She fell to the ground, and ---- cried: \"Give her another!\"\r\n\r\n      One of the deputies, standing over the motionless and\r\n      silent body, held his gun down and, without averting his\r\n      face, fired into the body that did not move.\r\n\r\n      An auto truck, in waiting, was hurried to the scene and the\r\n      body of the old miner thrown in; then Mrs. Sellins was\r\n      dragged by the heels to the back of the car. Before she was\r\n      placed in the truck, a deputy took a cudgel and crushed in\r\n      her skull before the eyes of the throng of men, women and\r\n      children, who stood in powerless silence before the armed\r\n      men. Deputy ---- picked up the woman's hat, placed it on his\r\n      head, danced a step, and said to the crowd: \"I'm Mrs.\r\n      Sellins now.\"\r\n\r\nThus perished noble Fannie Sellins: shot in the back by so-called peace\r\nofficers. And she 49 years old, a grandmother, and mother of a boy\r\nkilled in France, fighting to make the world safe for democracy.\r\n\r\nMany people witnessed this horrible murder. The guilty men were named\r\nopenly in the newspapers and from a hundred platforms. Yet no one was\r\never punished for the crime. Witnesses were spirited away or\r\nintimidated, and the whole matter hushed up in true Steel Trust fashion.\r\nA couple of deputies were arrested; but they were speedily released on\r\nsmaller bonds than those often set for strikers arrested for picketing.\r\nEventually they were freed altogether.\r\n\r\nThe killing of Mrs. Sellins, right in the teeth of the strike as it was,\r\nlent much bitterness to the general situation. Rightly or wrongly, the\r\nsteel workers, almost to a man, felt that this devoted woman was a\r\nmartyr to their cause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. FANNIE SELLINS, TRADE UNION ORGANIZER\r\n\r\nKilled by Steel Trust gunmen, West Natrona, Pa., Aug. 26, 1919.]\r\n\r\nUpon November 8, the Senate Committee, having completed its hearings,\r\nmade public its report. This document is a strange mixture of\r\nprogressive and reactionary principles. In some respects, especially\r\nwhere it grants, however confusedly, the right of collective bargaining\r\nand the eight hour day, it is just and meets the situation; but in other\r\nrespects it is so unfair to the workers' cause as to be grotesque. For\r\none thing it shoulders upon the unions the entire responsibility for the\r\nfailure to postpone the strike, choosing to disregard completely the\r\nclearly established fact that the steel companies were discharging men\r\nso fast that for the unions it was a case of strike or perish. In fact,\r\nthe report ignores altogether the bitter grievance of men being\r\ndischarged for union membership. Mr. Gary had said that this practice\r\nwas not engaged in, and that apparently settled it so far as the\r\nCommittee was concerned,--the testimony of dozens of victimized workers\r\n(with thousands more available) to the contrary notwithstanding. Other\r\nsins of the Steel Trust, the suppression of free speech and free\r\nassembly, etc., were passed over lightly; but the alleged virtues of its\r\nhousing and welfare plans were very highly lauded.\r\n\r\nNowhere are the workers more ruthlessly robbed and exploited by their\r\nemployers than in the steel industry. Speaking recently in Brooklyn on\r\nthe subject of profiteering, Mr. Basil Manly, formerly Joint Chairman of\r\nthe National War Labor Board, cited Page 367 of the Treasury report as\r\nshowing one steel company \"earning\" $14,549,952 in 1917 on a capital of\r\n$5,000, or a profit of 290,999 per cent. As the department conveniently\r\nsuppresses all details, it is impossible to learn the name of this\r\ncompany or how it made such fabulous profits. On the same page appeared\r\nanother steel company with a profit rate of 20,180 per cent. Speaking of\r\nthe United States Steel Corporation's returns, which of course were\r\ngarbled so that no outsider could understand them, Mr. Manly said:\r\n\r\n      For this reason I am unable to tell you, on the basis of the\r\n      Treasury Department's figures, what the net income of the\r\n      Steel Corporation is, but on the basis of its own published\r\n      report I can tell you that in two years, 1916 and 1917, the\r\n      net profits of the Steel Corporation, after payment of\r\n      interest on bonds and after making allowance for all charges\r\n      growing out of the installation of special war facilities,\r\n      amounted to $888,931,511. This is more by $20,000,000 than\r\n      the total capital stock of the Steel Corporation (which is\r\n      $868,583,600). In other words, in 1916 and 1917 every dollar\r\n      of the capital stock of the Steel Corporation was paid for\r\n      in net profits. In this connection it should be remembered\r\n      that when the Steel Corporation was formed its entire\r\n      $500,000,000 worth of common stock represented nothing but\r\n      water.\r\n\r\nThe other steel companies did as well or better, proportionately. W.\r\nJett Lauck, acting on behalf of the railroad workers, submitted figures\r\nto the United States Railroad Labor Board (A. P. dispatches May 19,\r\n1920) showing that during the years 1916-18 the Bethlehem Steel\r\nCorporation \"earned\" average annual profits of $29,000,000, or six times\r\nits pre-war average. In 1916 its profits amounted to 146 per cent. on\r\nits capital stock. Our Johnstown friend, the Cambria Steel Company, in\r\n1916-17 cleaned up $50,000,000 on $45,000,000 capital stock; while the\r\nLackawanna, Republic, Colorado Fuel and Iron, Jones and Laughlin,\r\nCrucible, etc., companies made similar killings.\r\n\r\nAs against useless, non-producing drones getting these millions, the\r\ngreat mass of workers actually operating the industry were receiving the\r\nbeggarly wages of from 42 to 48 cents per hour. They had received no\r\nincrease for a year before the strike, notwithstanding the skyrocketing\r\ncost of living. Yet the Senate Committee could discover no discontent at\r\nthis condition nor see any injustice in it. Upon page 10 of its report\r\nappears the startling statement that \"The question of wages is not\r\ninvolved in this controversy.\" Forty-two cents per hour would hardly buy\r\ncigars for these smug, well-fed gentlemen; still they would have us\r\nconclude that it is enough for a steel worker to raise a family upon.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, of course, that an increase in wages was a cardinal demand\r\nof the strikers, even though the Senate Committee did not get to learn\r\nof it.[13] And so great was the steel workers' need for more money that\r\nthe strike had scarcely ended when the United States Steel Corporation,\r\nfollowed soon after by the \"independents,\" granted its lesser skilled\r\nhelp 10 per cent. increase in wages, and promised \"an equitable\r\nadjustment\" to the widely advertised small minority of highly paid men.\r\n\r\nPart of the strike-breaking strategy of the Steel Trust was to alienate\r\npublic sympathy from the strike by denouncing it as an incipient\r\nrevolution which had to be put down at all costs. Public opinion was\r\nalready violently inflamed against everything savoring no matter how\r\nslightly of radicalism, and it was not difficult for the reactionary\r\nnewspapers to make the steel strike unpopular, even as they had, under\r\nvarious pretexts, the movements of the miners and railroad men of the\r\nperiod. One weapon they used extensively against the steel strike was an\r\nalmost forgotten pamphlet, \"Syndicalism,\" written by Earl C. Ford and\r\nmyself eight years ago.\r\n\r\nThroughout the hearings the investigating senators went along with this\r\nSteel Trust propaganda, which was not so surprising considering the fact\r\nthat of the five active committee men, one was a steel magnate, and\r\nthree others typical Bourbons. By playing up the \"little red book\" they\r\nsystematically fed the newspapers with the sensationalism they wanted\r\nand which the steel companies desired them to get. I was called before\r\nthe Committee and gruffly ordered to express my opinion on the doctrines\r\nin the booklet. In reply, I stated that the steel movement had been\r\ncarried on according to the strictest trade-union principles. It was\r\noverseen by the National Committee, consisting of twenty-four\r\npresidents of large international unions. As secretary of this committee\r\nI had necessarily worked under the close scrutiny of these men and\r\ndozens of their organizers--not to speak of the highest officials in the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor. Yet none of these trade unionists, keen\r\nthough they be to detect and condemn unusual practices and heresy in the\r\nranks, had found fault with the character of my work. Nor could the crew\r\nof detectives and stool pigeons of the steel companies and Department of\r\nJustice, who had dogged my footsteps for a year past, cite a single word\r\nsaid, a thing done, or a line written by me in the entire campaign which\r\nwould not measure up to most rigid trade-union standards. I contended\r\nthat my private opinions were immaterial as they did not and could not\r\nenter into the organizing work or the strike.\r\n\r\nBut the nation-wide head hunt of the radicals was on in full cry, and\r\nthe Senators had a good blood scent. They would follow it to the end.\r\nThey insisted that I express my opinion upon the wage system, the state,\r\nmorality, patriotism, marriage, etc. Finally, in a last effort to\r\nprotect the interests of the 2,000,000 men, women and children affected\r\nby the strike, I stated that if the vulture press, which was bound to\r\nmisrepresent what I said, was removed from the room, I would be glad to\r\noblige the Senators with a frank expression of my views upon any\r\nsubject. But this simple fairness to the steel workers and their\r\nfamilies they denied. The newspapers were clamoring for red meat, and\r\nthe Senators seemed determined they should have it. Having made my\r\nprotest and my prediction, I was compelled to yield; but the first\r\nnewspapers on the streets proved the soundness of my fears. My answers\r\nwere garbled and twisted against both the steel movement and me.\r\n\r\nThen there was the Margolis case. I charge that to be a deliberate\r\nframe-up against the steel strike. To prove the Steel Trust's contention\r\nthat the strike was a desperate revolutionary _coup_, engineered by men\r\nseeking to destroy our civilization generally, somewhat more was\r\nrequired than merely an eight year old booklet. The thing had to be\r\nbrought down to date and a far-reaching plot constructed. Hence the\r\nSenate Committee dragged in Mr. Margolis and made him a scapegoat. Mr.\r\nMargolis is a well known Anarchist attorney of Pittsburgh. He has the\r\nreputation of having served ably as counsel for several trade-union\r\norganizations, and has a wide circle of acquaintances among labor men.\r\nThe Senate Committee selected him as the man who had organized, with my\r\nhearty support and co-operation, the real force behind the strike, the\r\nI. W. W.'s, Anarchists and Bolshevists.\r\n\r\nNow the fact is that Mr. Margolis had nothing whatever to do, officially\r\nor unofficially, with the policies or management of either the\r\norganizing campaign or the strike. He had no connection with the Strike\r\ncommittee; nor did he ever even speak at a union meeting of steel\r\nworkers during the whole movement in question. If he wrote an article in\r\nsome radical paper, or spoke to a meeting of Russian workmen in\r\nYoungstown, endorsing the strike, as is said, he did it purely as an\r\nindividual sympathizer acting upon his own initiative. Mr. Margolis\r\nfreely stated this on the stand, and every union official in Pittsburgh\r\nknew it to be the case. So did the investigating Senators; but it the\r\nbetter served their purpose to enlarge upon Mr. Margolis' activities, in\r\nthe hope that his radical reputation would lend color to the plot theory\r\nwhich they were laboring so hard to establish, and which was so\r\nadvantageous to the Steel Trust.\r\n\r\nIn their final report the Senators continued their plot \"evidence\" and\r\ninsinuations, so persistently worked up all through their hearings. They\r\nignored highly important testimony tending to put the movement in its\r\nright light as a strictly trade-union affair, and gave prominence to\r\neverything to the contrary. They elevated unheard-of I. W. W.'s into\r\npowerful strike leaders and surrounded the most ordinary comings and\r\ngoings with revolutionary mystery. Where they lacked facts they cast\r\nsuspicion, leaving a vicious daily press to draw its own conclusions.\r\n\r\nAlthough they expressed great concern for the sufferings of the public\r\nin strikes, and advocated the establishment of an industrial tribunal to\r\nprevent them in the future, the worthy Senators, nevertheless,\r\nrecommended no means to end the steel strike. So far as they were\r\nconcerned, apparently they were willing to have the steel strike fought\r\nto a conclusion. At one of the Senate Committee hearings, John\r\nFitzpatrick, Chairman of the National Committee, agreed to arbitration.\r\nBut later Mr. Gary gave an emphatic \"No\" to this proposition. Mr. Gary's\r\nwishes usually had decisive weight with the Senators, so the matter was\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nOn October 1-3, 1919, a national conference called by the Industrial\r\nRelations Department of the Interchurch World Movement met at the Hotel\r\nPennsylvania in New York and adopted a resolution providing for a full\r\ninvestigation of the steel strike, then a burning public question. Under\r\nthe terms of this resolution the Industrial Relations Department set up\r\nan independent Commission of Inquiry, composed of representative\r\nchurchmen from all over the country who should be responsible for\r\ncarrying out the investigation. This Commission consisted of Bishop\r\nFrancis J. McConnell (Methodist), Chairman, Dr. Daniel A. Poling\r\n(Evangelical), vice-Chairman, Dr. John McDowell (Presbyterian), Mrs.\r\nFred Bennett (Board of Foreign Missions), Dr. Nicholas Van Der Pyl\r\n(Congregational), Dr. Alva W. Taylor (Disciples), and Mr. Geo. W.\r\nColeman (Baptist).\r\n\r\nIn order to commit the investigation of technical data to the hands of\r\ntrained men, the Industrial Relations Department obtained the services\r\nof the Bureau of Industrial Research, New York, which, besides its own\r\nresearches, obtained the co-operation of various other scientific\r\nagencies and organized a staff of field workers whose principal members\r\nwere: Mr. George Soule, Mr. David J. Saposs, Miss Marian D. Savage, Mr.\r\nMarion K. Wisehart and Mr. Robert Littell. A member of the Bureau of\r\nIndustrial Research, Mr. Heber Blankenhorn, had charge of the field work\r\nand later acted as Secretary to the Commission of Inquiry, which held\r\nhearings in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and other steel centres.\r\n\r\nThe Interchurch World Movement, representing as it does the organized\r\nProtestant millions of America, is a conservative and respectable body,\r\nif there is such in this country. Yet when it stepped upon the toes of\r\nthe Steel Trust by starting the investigation it found itself soon\r\nclassed among the revolutionaries. Persistent rumors were sent\r\nbroadcast, and even newspaper stories, to the effect that the\r\nCommission's investigators were \"Bolsheviks\" and that the Interchurch\r\nWorld Movement was permeated with \"anarchists.\" This hampered the work\r\ngreatly, especially among employers. Finally a threat of legal action\r\nwas necessary against a large commercial organization which had\r\ncirculated the rumors officially. It eventually retracted in full. As\r\nfor the workers, they gave the fullest co-operation to the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the scientific methods and apparent desire to get at the\r\ntruth of the strike situation manifested in the Interchurch\r\ninvestigation--which stood in striking contrast to the slipshod,\r\nhaphazard system, \"red\" mania, and violent partiality towards the steel\r\ncompanies shown by the Senate Committee,--the strike leaders decided to\r\nask the Commission to undertake a settlement of the strike by mediation,\r\nwhich the Commission had the power to do under the resolution creating\r\nit. The workers' representatives felt that no stone should be left\r\nunturned to get a settlement, and that if the powerful Interchurch\r\nmovement stirred in their behalf possibly Mr. Gary would be dislodged\r\nfrom his position.\r\n\r\nConsequently, John Fitzpatrick, Chairman of the National Committee, put\r\nbefore Mr. Blankenhorn a plan for the settlement of the strike by\r\nmediation. Mr. Blankenhorn felt, however, that it might be better to\r\nrecommend that the Commission move independently, rather than as merely\r\nrepresenting the strikers, and submitted the following plan, which was\r\nadopted by the Commission:\r\n\r\n      1. To mediate in behalf of all the steel workers, both those\r\n      on strike and those who had gone back to work.\r\n\r\n      2. That the purpose of the mediation should be to establish\r\n      a new deal in the steel industry rather than merely to end\r\n      the strike.\r\n\r\n      3. That the ending of the strike should be arranged solely\r\n      with a view to giving the new deal the best possible chance.\r\n\r\nOn December 1, the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel\r\nWorkers met and formally accepted this proposition of mediation. What\r\nhappened next is told in an official statement to the writer of this\r\nbook:\r\n\r\n      On December 5 a committee from the Commission, consisting of\r\n      Bishop McConnell, Dr. Poling and Dr. McDowell, called on Mr.\r\n      Gary with the purpose of, first, ascertaining if he would\r\n      accept their office as mediators; next, of proposing their\r\n      plan of mediation and pressing the acceptance of it by the\r\n      employers; and, finally, of ordering the men back to work,\r\n      the strike leaders to step out of the situation, and the\r\n      Commission to set up a permanent mediation body to bring\r\n      about a conference between employers and employees in the\r\n      steel industry. There was the feeling in the Commission that\r\n      extraordinary concessions had been made by the leaders of\r\n      the strike and that any reasons advocated by the employers\r\n      for not accepting the mediation plan would have to be\r\n      weighty.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Gary received the Commission courteously and after\r\n      minutely cross-examining them concerning the \"anonymous\"\r\n      report of the presence of \"Bolsheviks\" among them, he heard\r\n      the Commission to the extent of learning the first step in\r\n      their proposal. He made his reply immediately, an absolute\r\n      refusal of arbitration or mediation. The Commission\r\n      therefore never had any opportunity to present the\r\n      authorized acceptance of the mediation plan by the other\r\n      side and in no sense conveyed to Mr. Gary the extent of the\r\n      concessions which the strikers were then willing to make.\r\n      Mr. Gary, however, clearly understood that acceptance of the\r\n      mediation plan would mean that the men would all return to\r\n      work at once.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Gary based his refusal on the grounds that any dealings\r\n      which in any way involved representatives of the men then on\r\n      strike would be an acceptance of the closed shop, sovietism,\r\n      and the forcible distribution of property. Mr. Gary said\r\n      that if the Commission represented the men who had gone back\r\n      to work, those men were content; if the Commission\r\n      represented the men who had not gone back to work, those men\r\n      are nothing but red radicals whom the plants did not want\r\n      anyway. He said that there was absolutely no issue for\r\n      discussion with the U. S. Steel Corporation.\r\n\r\n      The Commission presented its viewpoint on the advisability\r\n      of mediation at great length and with insistence. Mr. Gary\r\n      did not in any respect modify his immediate decision.\r\n\r\n      The Commission felt it necessary therefore to drop the plan\r\n      and transmitted the following to the National Committee:\r\n\r\n\r\n      December 6, 1919\r\n\r\n      Memorandum for Mr. Fitzpatrick:\r\n\r\n      The independent Commission of Inquiry, instituted by the\r\n      Interchurch World Movement to investigate the steel strike,\r\n      received on December 2 a communication marked\r\n      \"confidential,\" dealing with an official action taken by the\r\n      National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers,\r\n      signed by Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Foster.\r\n\r\n      On December 5, members of the Commission informally\r\n      conversed with Mr. Gary for two hours, proposing to plan a\r\n      new basis of relations in the steel industry, with an ending\r\n      of the strike best calculated to further better relations.\r\n      They offered to act as mediators both on behalf of the men\r\n      still on strike, whose leaders were to order them back and\r\n      then step out of the situation, and on behalf of still\r\n      dissatisfied men who had nevertheless returned to work.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Gary refused to confer with these representatives of the\r\n      churches as mediators in behalf of any interests represented\r\n      by you in the strike, on the ground that the men still out\r\n      were Bolshevist radicals who were not wanted in the mills\r\n      and who would not be taken back.\r\n\r\n      And as to mediating in behalf of any other interests, Mr.\r\n      Gary said that the men were contented and that \"there is no\r\n      issue.\"\r\n\r\n      I am requested to communicate the above information to you\r\n      by the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n      Very truly yours,\r\n      H. BLANKENHORN.\r\n\r\nAt the time this book goes to press the findings and recommendations of\r\nthe Commission have not yet been made public.\r\n\r\nThis made the sixth attempt of the National Committee to settle the\r\nsteel controversy--not to mention the individual effort of the\r\nAmalgamated Association. They were: (1) The letter from Mr. Gompers to\r\nMr. Gary requesting a conference; (2) the visit to his office of the\r\nNational Committee conference committee, equipped with the power to set\r\na strike date; (3) the appeal to President Wilson to arrange a\r\nconference; (4) Organized Labor's resolution in the National Industrial\r\nConference to have that body select an arbitration board; (5) The offer\r\nof arbitration by John Fitzpatrick while testifying before the Senate\r\nCommittee; and, (6) the Interchurch mediation incident.\r\n\r\nBut they were all futile. Mr. Gary's policy is the time-honored one of\r\nall tyrants, rule or ruin. The unions had no option but to fight, and\r\nthis they did to the best of their ability.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[13] There seemed to be many important things of which this committee\r\nhad never heard. For instance, when in my testimony I referred to Lester\r\nF. Ward, Senator Sterling innocently inquired who he was. He had\r\napparently never even heard of this eminent American sociologist, who\r\nwas perhaps the greatest scholar ever born in the western hemisphere,\r\nand whose name is honored by scientific minds the world over. And what\r\nmakes Senator Sterling's ignorance the more inexcusable is that he was\r\nactually holding office in Washington at the same time that Professor\r\nWard was carrying on his brilliant studies in that very city. For one\r\nwho stresses so much his 100 per cent. Americanism as does the Senator\r\nit is indeed a sad showing not to be familiar with this great native\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE COURSE OF THE STRIKE\r\n\r\n    PITTSBURGH DISTRICT--THE RAILROAD MEN--CORRUPT NEWSPAPERS\r\n      --CHICAGO DISTRICT--FEDERAL TROOPS AT GARY--YOUNGSTOWN\r\n      DISTRICT--THE AMALGAMATED ASSOCIATION--CLEVELAND--THE ROD\r\n      AND WIRE MILL STRIKE--THE BETHLEHEM PLANTS--BUFFALO AND\r\n      LACKAWANNA--WHEELING AND STEUBENVILLE--PUEBLO--JOHNSTOWN\r\n      --MOB RULE--THE END OF THE STRIKE.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Steel strike was national in scope and manifested the same\r\ngeneral, basic tendencies everywhere, nevertheless it differed enough\r\nfrom place to place to render necessary some indication of particular\r\nevents in the various districts in order to convey a clear conception of\r\nthe movement as a whole. It is the purpose of this chapter to point out\r\na few of these salient features in the several localities and to draw\r\nsome lessons therefrom.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate Pittsburgh district, due to the extreme difficulties\r\nunder which the organizing work was carried on and the strike\r\ninaugurated, the shut-down was not so thorough as elsewhere.\r\nConsiderable numbers of men, notably in the skilled trades, remained at\r\nwork, and the mills limped along, at least pretending to operate. This\r\nwas exceedingly bad, Pittsburgh being the strategic centre of the\r\nstrike, as it is of the industry, and the companies were making\r\ntremendous capital of the fact that the mills there were still producing\r\nsteel. Accordingly, the National Committee left no stone unturned to\r\ncomplete the tie-up, already 75 per cent. effective. But under the\r\ncircumstances, with meetings banned and picketing prohibited, it was out\r\nof the question to reach directly the men who had stayed at work. The\r\nkey to the situation was in the hands of the railroad men.\r\n\r\nOperating between the various steel plants and connecting them up with\r\nthe main lines, there are several switching roads, such as the Union\r\nRailroad and the McKeesport and Monongahela Connecting Lines. They are\r\nthe nerve centers of the local steel industry. If they could be struck\r\nthe mills would have to come to a standstill. The National Committee\r\nimmediately delegated organizers to investigate the situation. These\r\nreported that the body of the men in the operating departments were\r\norganized; that they had no contracts with the steel companies, and that\r\nthey were ready for action, but awaiting co-operation from their\r\nrespective national headquarters.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the National Committee arranged a conference in Washington\r\nwith responsible representatives of the Brotherhoods and laid the\r\nsituation before them. In reply they stated that their policy was\r\nstrictly to observe their contracts wherever they had such, and that\r\ntheir men would be forbidden to do work around the mills not done by\r\nthem prior to the strike. It was up to the men on the non-contract roads\r\nand yards to decide for themselves about joining the strike. We informed\r\nthem then that the situation was such, with the men scattered through\r\nmany locals, that merely leaving it up to them was insufficient; it\r\nwould be impossible for them to act together without direct aid and\r\nencouragement from their higher officials. We made the specific request\r\nthat each of the organizations send a man into Pittsburgh to take a\r\nstrike vote of the men in question, who are all employees of the steel\r\ncompanies. They took the matter under advisement; but nothing came of\r\nit, although long afterwards, when the opportune moment had passed,\r\norganizer J. M. Patterson of the Railway Carmen (also of the Trainmen)\r\nwas authorized to take a strike vote. Thus was lost the chance to close\r\ndown these strategic switching lines and with them, in all likelihood,\r\nseveral big mills in the most vital district in the entire steel\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThroughout the strike zone general disappointment was expressed by the\r\nsteel workers at the apparent lack of sympathy with their cause shown by\r\nthe officials of the Brotherhoods. The steel workers, bitterly oppressed\r\nfor a generation and fighting desperately towards the light in the face\r\nof unheard-of opposition, turned instinctively for aid to their closely\r\nrelated, powerfully organized fellow workers, the railroad men. And the\r\nlatter could easily have lent them effective, if not decisive assistance\r\nwithout violating a contract or in any way endangering their standing.\r\nIt was not to be expected that the trunk line men, working as they were\r\nunder government agreements, would refuse to haul the scab steel; but\r\nthere were many other ways, perfectly legitimate under current\r\ntrade-union practice and ethics, in which help could have been given;\r\nyet it was not. From Youngstown and elsewhere the railroad men who did\r\ngo on strike in the mill yards complained with bitterness that they were\r\nneglected and denied strike benefits, and that the rule that no road man\r\nshould do work around the mills not customary before the strike was\r\nflagrantly violated. Usually the rank and file were strongly disposed to\r\nassist the hard-pressed steel workers, and they could have everywhere\r\nwonderfully stiffened the strike, but the necessary encouragement and\r\ncooperation from the several headquarters was lacking. Truth demands\r\nthat these unpleasant things be set down. Labor can learn and progress\r\nonly through a frank acknowledgment and discussion of its weaknesses,\r\nmistakes and failures.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all their other handicaps the Pittsburgh district\r\nstrikers had to contend with a particularly treacherous local press.\r\nEverywhere our daily papers are newspapers only by courtesy of a\r\nmisapplied term. They are sailing under false colors. Pretending to be\r\npurveyors of unbiased accounts of current happenings, they are in\r\nreality merely propaganda organs, twisting, garbling and suppressing\r\nfacts and information in the manner best calculated to further the\r\ninterests of the employing class. The whole newsgathering and\r\ndistributing system is a gigantic mental prostitution. Consequently,\r\nconsidering the issues involved, it was not surprising to see the big\r\ndaily papers take such a decided stand against the steel workers.\r\nEverywhere in steel districts the papers were bad enough, but those in\r\nthe Pittsburgh district outstripped all the rest. They gave themselves\r\nover body and soul to the service of the Steel Trust.\r\n\r\nFrom the first these Pittsburgh papers were violently antagonistic to\r\nthe steel workers. Every sophistry uttered by Mr. Gary to the effect\r\nthat the strike was an effort to establish the \"closed shop,\" a bid for\r\npower, or an attempt at revolution, the papers echoed and re-echoed _ad\r\nnauseum_. They played up the race issue, virtually advising the\r\nAmericans to stand together against the foreigners who were about to\r\noverwhelm them. They painted the interests of the country as being\r\nsynonymous with those of the steel companies and tried to make\r\nAmericanism identical with scabbery. For them no further proof of one's\r\npatriotism was needed than to go back to the mills. Every clubbing of\r\nstrikers was the heroic work of the law-abiding against reckless mobs.\r\nStrike \"riots\" were manufactured out of whole cloth. For instance, when\r\nthe senators investigating the strike were visiting the Homestead mills,\r\na couple of strike-breakers quarreling with each other, several blocks\r\naway, fired a shot. An hour later screaming headlines told the startled\r\npopulace of Pittsburgh that \"STRIKERS SHOOT AT SENATORS\" and \"MOB\r\nATTACKS SENATE COMMITTEE.\" Even the stand-pat senators had to protest\r\nthat this was going it too strong.\r\n\r\nIn revenge for an alleged dynamiting in Donora, Pa., the authorities\r\nswooped down upon the union headquarters, arrested 101 strikers present,\r\nincluding organizer Walter Hodges, and charged them with the crime.\r\nSince there was not a shred of evidence against the accused, they were\r\nall eventually discharged. Then the Donora _Herald_, which forever\r\nyelped that the organizers advocated violence, had this to say:\r\n\r\n      One of the reasons we have sedition preached in America is\r\n      because we have grand juries like that at Washington (Pa.)\r\n      this week which ignored the dynamiting cases. Possibly the\r\n      biggest mistake of all was made in not using rifles at the\r\n      time instead of turning the guilty parties over to the very\r\n      sensitive mercies of the grand jury.\r\n\r\nBut the journalistic strike-breaking master-stroke was an organized\r\neffort to stampede the men back to work by minimizing the strike's\r\neffectiveness. First the papers declared that only a few thousands of\r\nPittsburgh's steel workers went out. Then they followed this for weeks\r\nwith stories of thousands of men flocking back to the mills. Full page\r\nadvertisements begged the men to go back; while flaming headlines told\r\nus that \"MEN GO BACK TO MILLS,\" \"STEEL STRIKE WANING,\" \"MILLS OPERATING\r\nSTRONGER,\" \"MORE MEN GO BACK TO WORK,\" etc. It became a joke, but the\r\npatient Pittsburgh people couldn't see it. Said Wm. Hard in the\r\n_Metropolitan_ for February, 1920:\r\n\r\n      \"Mr. Foster,\" I said, \"I am going to be perfectly frank with\r\n      you. I know your strike's a fizzle of course, but I know\r\n      more. I not only take pains to read the telegraphic\r\n      dispatches of the news from the managers of the steel mills,\r\n      but I keep the clippings. I have the history of your strike\r\n      in cold print. Hardly anybody struck anyhow, in most places,\r\n      except some foreigners; and then they began at once to go\r\n      back in thousands and thousands and new thousands every day\r\n      for months. If you claim there were 300,000 strikers, I\r\n      don't care. I've counted up the fellows that went back to\r\n      work, and I've totalled them up day by day. They're a little\r\n      over 4,800,000. So you're pretty far behind.\"\r\n\r\nBut despite everything--the suppression of free speech and free\r\nassembly, Cossack terrorism, official tyranny, prostitution of the\r\ncourts, attacks from the lying press, and all the rest of it--the steel\r\nworkers in the immediate Pittsburgh district (comprising the towns along\r\nthe Allegheny and Monongahela rivers from Apollo to Monessen) made a\r\nsplendid fight. The very pressure seemed to hold them the better\r\ntogether. Their ranks were never really broken, the strike being\r\nweakened only by a long, costly wearing-away process. The stampede back\r\nto work, so eagerly striven for by the employers, did not materialize.\r\nIn the beginning of the strike the Pittsburgh district was the weakest\r\npoint in the battle line; at the end it was one of the very strongest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chicago district struck very well, but it weakened earlier than\r\nothers. This was because the employers scored a break-through at Indiana\r\nHarbor and Gary, particularly the latter place, which shattered the\r\nwhole line.\r\n\r\nGary, the great western stronghold of the United States Steel\r\nCorporation, was the storm center of the Chicago district at all times.\r\nHardly had the organization campaign begun in 1918, when the Gary\r\n_Tribune_ bitterly assailed the unions, accusing them of advocating\r\nevasion of the draft, discouragement of liberty bond sales, and general\r\nopposition to the war program. These lies were run in a full page\r\neditorial in English, and repeated in a special eight page supplement\r\ncontaining sixteen languages, a half page to each. Many thousands of\r\ncopies were scattered broadcast. Other attacks in a similar vein\r\nfollowed. It was a foul blast straight from the maw of the Steel Trust.\r\nIncidentally it created a situation which shows how the steel men\r\ncontrol public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe new unions immediately boycotted the _Tribune_. Result: the Gary\r\n_Post_, somewhat friendly inclined, doubled its circulation at once. The\r\n_Post_ then became more friendly; whereupon, it is alleged, a leading\r\nbanker called the editor to his office and told him that if he did not\r\ntake a stand against the unions his credit would be stopped, which would\r\nhave meant suspension within the week. That very day the _Post_ joined\r\nthe _Tribune's_ campaign of abuse. Apparently the _Post's_ youthful\r\neditor had learned a new wrinkle in journalism.\r\n\r\nThe Steel Trust did all it could to hold Gary from unionizing; but when\r\nthe strike came the walkout was estimated to be 97 per cent. At first\r\neverything went peacefully, but the Steel Corporation was watching for\r\nan opportunity to get its strategic Gary mills into operation. The\r\noccasion presented itself on October 4, when strikers coming from a\r\nmeeting fell foul of some homeward bound scabs. Local labor men declare\r\nthe resultant scrimmage \"did not make as much disturbance as ordinarily\r\nwould occur in a saloon when two or three men were fighting.\" It was a\r\ntrivial incident--a matter for the police. Only one man was injured, and\r\nhe very slightly. But the inspired press yelled red murder and pictured\r\nthe hospitals as full of wounded. The militia were ordered in. The\r\nunions offered to furnish 700 ex-service men to enforce law and order;\r\nbut this was rejected. Later the militia were transferred to Indiana\r\nHarbor; on October 6, a provisional regiment of regular troops, under\r\ncommand of General Leonard Wood, came to Gary from nearby Fort Sheridan,\r\nand martial law was at once proclaimed. The Steel Corporation now had\r\nthe situation in hand; and the Gary strike was doomed.\r\n\r\nGrave charges were voiced against the misuse made of the Federal troops\r\nin Gary. John Fitzpatrick writes me as follows, basing his statements\r\nupon reliable witnesses:\r\n\r\n      Now we have military control, the city of Gary being placed\r\n      under martial law. The strike leaders and pickets were\r\n      arrested by the soldiers and put to work splitting wood and\r\n      sweeping the streets. This was most humiliating, because the\r\n      camp was across the street from the city hall and in the\r\n      most frequented part of the city.\r\n\r\n      When street-sweeping here did not break their spirits, these\r\n      men were taken to the back streets, where they had their\r\n      homes and where their own and the neighbor's children\r\n      watched them through the windows.\r\n\r\n      The so-called foreigners have great respect for law and\r\n      authority, especially military authority, which plays such a\r\n      big part in their native environments. The U. S. Steel\r\n      Corporation did not fail to take advantage of this. In the\r\n      first place they gave out the impression that the letters\r\n      \"U. S.\" in the corporation's name indicated that it was\r\n      owned by the U. S. Government, and that the Government\r\n      soldiers being in town meant that any one interfering with\r\n      the steel company's affairs would be deported or sent to\r\n      Fort Leavenworth.\r\n\r\n      Then a mill superintendent would take a squad of soldiers\r\n      and go to the home of a striker. The soldiers would be lined\r\n      up in front of the house; the superintendent would go in. He\r\n      would tell John that he came to give him his last chance to\r\n      return to work, saying that if he refused he would either go\r\n      to jail or be deported. Then he would take John to the\r\n      window and show him the row of soldiers. John would look at\r\n      the wife and kids and make up his mind that his first duty\r\n      was to them; that was what the strike was for anyway. So he\r\n      would put on his coat and go back to the mills. Then the\r\n      superintendent would go to the next house and repeat the\r\n      performance.\r\n\r\nSuch tactics, coupled with spectacular midnight raids to \"unearth\" the\r\nwidely advertised \"red\" plotters,--conveniently ignored until the\r\nstrike,--the suppression of meetings, limitations on picketing, and the\r\nhundred forms of studied intimidation practiced by the soldiery, in a\r\nfew weeks broke the backbone of the strike. And while the regular troops\r\noperated so successfully and systematically against the workers in Gary,\r\nthe militia did almost as well in Indiana Harbor, where the strike also\r\ncracked.\r\n\r\nThe great reactionary interests which backed General Wood for the\r\nRepublican presidential nomination, including the Steel Trust, are\r\ngiving him boundless credit for breaking the steel strike in Gary.\r\nConsequently there are many workers who believe the whole affair was\r\nstaged to further his political fortunes. If not, how did it happen that\r\nthe militia, who could have handled the situation easily, were sent out\r\nof Gary to make room for his regulars? And why was it that before there\r\nwas a sign of trouble General Wood had formed his provisional regiment,\r\nshipped it from Fort Dodge to Fort Sheridan, and made other active\r\npreparations to invade Gary? And then, how did it come that he took\r\ncharge of the situation in person, when at best it was only a colonel's\r\njob? In fact, how about the whole wretched business? Was it merely a\r\npolitical stunt to give General Wood the publicity that came to him for\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThe collapse at Gary and Indiana Harbor affected adversely South Chicago\r\nand almost the whole Chicago district. Worse still, it weakened the\r\nmorale everywhere; and thus undermined, the strike rapidly\r\ndisintegrated. By the middle of November, district secretary De Young\r\nreported that all the mills in the district, except those in Joliet and\r\nWaukegan, were working crews from 50 to 85 per cent. of normal,\r\nalthough, due to green hands and demoralized working forces, production\r\naveraged considerably lower. And the situation gradually grew worse.\r\nJoliet and Waukegan, however, held fast to the end, making a fight\r\ncomparable with that of the men in Peoria and Hammond, who had gone out\r\nseveral weeks before September 22. It was at the latter place that\r\npolice and company guards brutally shot down and killed four strikers on\r\nSeptember 9.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the immediate Youngstown district the strike was highly effective,\r\nhardly a ton of steel being produced anywhere for several weeks. This\r\nwas due largely to the walkout of the railroad men employed in the mill\r\nyards, who acted on their own volition. Many of these belonged to the\r\nBrotherhoods, and others to the Switchmen's Union, while some were\r\nunorganized; but all struck together. Then they held joint mass\r\nmeetings, got an agreement from the A. F. of L. unions that they would\r\nbe protected and represented in any settlement made, and stuck loyally\r\nto the finish. They were a strong mainstay of the strike.\r\n\r\nThe weakening of the strike began about November 15. In a number of\r\nplants, notably those of the Trumbull Steel Company and the Sharon Steel\r\nHoop Company, the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers\r\nhad agreements covering the skilled steel making trades, but when the\r\nlaborers struck these skilled men had to quit also. The break in the\r\ndistrict came when the Amalgamated Association virtually forced the\r\nlaborers back to work in these shops in order to get them in operation.\r\nThis action its officials justified by the following clause in their\r\nagreements:\r\n\r\n      It was agreed that when a scale or scales are signed in\r\n      general or local conferences, said scales or contracts shall\r\n      be considered inviolate for that scale year, and should the\r\n      employees of any departments (who do not come under the\r\n      above named scales or contracts) become members of the\r\n      Amalgamated Association during the said scale year, the\r\n      Amalgamated Association may present a scale of wages\r\n      covering said employees, but in case men and management\r\n      cannot come to an agreement on said scale, same shall be\r\n      held over until the next general or local conference, and\r\n      all men shall continue work until the expiration of the\r\n      scale year.\r\n\r\nRelying upon their rights under this clause, the companies naturally\r\nrefused to give the laborers any consideration whatever until the end of\r\nthe scale year. This meant that the latter were told to work and wait\r\nuntil the following June, when their grievances would be taken up. The\r\nresult was disastrous; the laborers generally lost faith in the\r\nAmalgamated Association, feeling that they had been sacrificed for the\r\nskilled workers. They began to flock back to work in all the plants.\r\nThen men in other trades took the position that it was foolish for them\r\nto fight on, seeing that the Amalgamated Association was forcing its men\r\nback into the mills. A general movement millward set in. By December 10\r\nthe strike was in bad shape. In passing it may be noted that in\r\nPittsburgh and other places where it had contracts, the Amalgamated\r\nAssociation took the same action, with the same general results,\r\nalthough not so extensive and harmful as in the Youngstown district. In\r\nCleveland the charters were taken from local unions that refused to\r\nabide by this clause.\r\n\r\nThe other trades affiliated with the National Committee protested\r\nagainst the enforcement of the clause. They declared it to be invalid,\r\nbecause it violated trade-union principles and fundamental human\r\nrights. Seeing that no consideration was given the laborers under the\r\nagreement, their right to strike should have been preserved inviolate.\r\nIt verged upon peonage to tie them up with an agreement that gave them\r\nno protection yet deprived them of the right to defend themselves. These\r\ntrades freely predicted that to enforce the clause would break the\r\nstrike in the Youngstown district, as it was altogether out of the\r\nquestion to ask men who had been on strike two months (especially men\r\ninexperienced in unionism) to resume work upon such conditions. But all\r\narguments were vain; the Amalgamated Association officials were as\r\nadamant. They held their agreements with the employers to be sacred and\r\nto rank above any covenants they had entered into with the co-operating\r\ntrades. They would enforce them to the letter--the interests of the\r\nlaborers, the mechanical trades, and even the strike itself, to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. Being a federated body, the National Committee\r\nhad to bow to this decision and stand by, helpless, while its effects\r\nworked havoc with the strike.\r\n\r\nInto Youngstown, in common with all the other districts, armies of scabs\r\nwere poured. It was the policy of the United States Steel Corporation to\r\noperate, or at least to pretend to operate its mills, regardless of\r\ncost. So all the \"independents\" had to do likewise. Word came to the\r\nNational Committee of several companies which, rather than try to run\r\nwith the high-priced, worthless strike-breakers, would have been glad\r\neither to settle with the unions or to close their plants. But they were\r\nafraid to do either; Gary had said \"Operate,\" and it was a case of do\r\nthat or risk going out of business.\r\n\r\nThe demand for scabs was tremendous. Probably half the strike-breaking\r\nagencies in the country were engaged in recruiting them. Thousands of\r\nnegroes were brought from the South, and thousands of guttersnipe whites\r\nfrom the big northern cities. But worst of all were the skilled steel\r\nworkers from outlying sections. There were many of such men who went on\r\nstrike in their own home towns, sneaked away to other steel centres and\r\nworked there until the strike was over. Then they would return to their\r\nold jobs with cock-and-bull stories (for the workers only) of having\r\nworked in other industries, thus seeking to escape the dreaded odium of\r\nbeing known as scabs. These contemptible cowards, being competent\r\nworkers, wrought incalculable injury to the strike everywhere,\r\nespecially in the Youngstown district.\r\n\r\nThe Youngstown authorities, to begin with, were reasonably fair towards\r\nthe strikers; but as the strike wore on and the steel companies and\r\nbusiness men became desperate at the determined resistance of the\r\nworkers, they began to apply \"Pennsylvania tactics.\" In Youngstown and\r\nEast Youngstown, Mayors Craver and McVey prohibited meetings, \"the\r\nobject of which is discussion of matters pertaining to prolonging the\r\nstrike.\"[14] On November 22, district secretary McCadden, and organizers\r\nJohn Klinsky and Frank Kurowsky were arrested in East Youngstown,\r\ncharged with criminal syndicalism and held for $3,000 bonds each. Later\r\na whole local union, No. 104 Amalgamated Association, was arrested in\r\nthe same town for holding a business meeting. \"Citizens' committees\"\r\nwere formed, and open threats made to tar and feather all the organizers\r\nand drive them out of town. But the steel companies were unable to\r\ninflame public opinion sufficiently for them to venture this outrage.\r\n\r\nAfterward the organizers were discharged; and in releasing the men\r\narrested for holding a business meeting, Judge David G. Jenkins said:\r\n\r\n      I regard the ordinance (E. Youngstown anti-free assembly) as\r\n      a form of hysteria which has been sweeping the country,\r\n      whereby well-meaning people, in the guise of patriots, have\r\n      sought to preserve America even though going to the extent\r\n      of denying the fundamental principles upon which Americanism\r\n      is based, and free assemblage is one of those fundamentals.\r\n\r\nIn the principal outlying towns of the Youngstown district, namely\r\nButler, Farrell, Sharon, Newcastle and Canton, the strikers were given\r\nthe worst of it. The first four being Pennsylvania towns, no specific\r\ndescription of them is necessary. Suffice it to say that typical Cossack\r\nconditions prevailed. In Canton it was not much better. The companies\r\nturned loose many vicious gunmen on the strikers. The mayor was removed\r\nfrom office and his place given to a company man; and a sweeping\r\ninjunction was issued against the strikers, denying them many\r\nfundamental rights.[15] The district, nevertheless, held remarkably\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nCleveland from the first to the last was one of the strong points in\r\nthe battle line. On September 22 the men struck almost 100 per cent. in\r\nall the big plants, and until the very end preserved a wonderful\r\nsolidarity. Under the excellent control of the organizers working with\r\nSecretary Raisse there was at no time a serious break in the ranks, and\r\nwhen the strike was called off on January 8, at least 50 per cent. of\r\nthe men were still out, with production not over 30 per cent. of normal.\r\nThousands of the men refused to go back to the mills at all, leaving\r\nthem badly crippled.\r\n\r\nThe backbone of the Cleveland strike was the enormous mills of the\r\nAmerican Steel and Wire Co. This calls attention to the fact that, as a\r\nwhole, the employees of this subsidiary of the U. S. Steel Corporation\r\nmade incomparably a better fight than did the workers in any other\r\nconsiderable branch of the steel industry. Long after the strike had\r\nbeen cracked in all other sections of the industry, the rod and wire\r\nmill men of Cleveland, Donora, Braddock, Rankin, Joliet and Waukegan\r\nstood practically solid. Even as late as December 27, only twelve days\r\nbefore the end, the companies were forced to the expedient of assembling\r\na rump meeting in Cleveland of delegates from many centres, for the\r\npurpose of calling off the strike. But the men voted unanimously for\r\ncontinuation under the leadership of the National Committee. When the\r\nstrike was finally ended, however, they accepted the decision with good\r\ngrace, because they were penetrated with the general strike idea and\r\nrealized the folly of trying alone to whip the united steel companies.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fight of the rod and wire mill men was due in large\r\nmeasure to the peculiar circumstances surrounding their organization.\r\nThese are highly important and require explanation: The regular system\r\nused by the National Committee resulted usually in organization from the\r\nbottom upward; that is, in response to the general appeals made to the\r\nmen in the great mass meetings, ordinarily the first to join the unions\r\nwere the unskilled, who are the workers with the least to lose, the most\r\nto gain, and consequently those most likely to take a chance. Gradually,\r\nas the confidence of the men developed, the movement would extend on up\r\nthrough the plants until it included the highest skilled men. Given time\r\nand a reasonable opportunity, it was an infallible system. It was far\r\nsuperior to the old trade-union plan of working solely from the top\r\ndown, because the latter always stopped before it got to the main body\r\nof the men, the unskilled workers.\r\n\r\nThe \"bottom upward\" system was used with the rod and wire mills, the\r\nsame as with all others. But while it was operating the skilled men who\r\nhad been attracted to the movement in Joliet, Donora and Cleveland\r\nstarted a \"top downward\" movement of their own. They sent committees to\r\nall the large rod and wire mills in the country, appealing to the\r\nskilled men to organize. These committeemen, actual workers and\r\nacquainted with all the old timers in the business, could do more real\r\norganizing in a day with their tradesmen than regular organizers could\r\nin a month. Hardly would they go into a locality, no matter how\r\ndifficult, than they would at once inspire that confidence in the\r\nmovement which is so indispensable, and which takes organizers so long\r\nto develop. The result was a \"top downward\" movement working\r\nsimultaneously with the \"bottom upward\" drive, which produced a high\r\ndegree of organization for the rod and wire mill men.\r\n\r\nA great weakness of the strike was the failure of many skilled workers\r\nto participate therein. This tended directly to aid the employers, and\r\nalso to discourage the unskilled workers, who looked for their more\r\nexpert brothers to take the lead in the strike as well as in the regular\r\nshop experiences. The explanation has been offered that this aloofness\r\nwas because the skilled men are \"unorganizable.\" But this is a dream. In\r\nthe mills controlled by it, the Amalgamated Association (which is really\r\na skilled workers' union) has thousands of them in its ranks, most of\r\nwhom earn higher wages than employees of similar classes in the Trust\r\nmills. If the proper means to organize them could have been applied, the\r\nskilled workers would have been the leaders in the late strike, instead\r\nof generally the scabs. The same thing done in the rod and wire mills\r\nshould have been done in all the important sections of the industry,\r\nblast furnaces, open hearths, sheet, tin, rail, plate, tube mills, etc.\r\nCommittees of well-known skilled workers in these departments should\r\nhave been sent forth everywhere to start movements from the top to meet\r\nthe great surge coming up from the bottom. Had this been done, then Gary\r\nwith all his millions could not have broken the strike. The tie-up would\r\nhave been so complete and enduring that a settlement would have been\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\nBut it was impossible; the chronic lack of resources prevented it. With\r\nthe pitifully inadequate funds and men at its disposal, all the National\r\nCommittee could do was to go ahead with its general campaign, leaving\r\nthe detail and special work undone. It is certainly to be hoped that in\r\nthe next big drive this committee system will be extensively followed.\r\nIt is the solution of the skilled worker problem, and when applied\r\nintelligently in connection with the fundamental \"bottom upward\"\r\nmovement, it must result in the organization of the industry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Bethlehem Steel Company's plants the strike was not very\r\neffective. This was due principally to the failure of previous strikes\r\nand to general lack of organization. In Reading and in Lebanon there had\r\nbeen strikes on for many weeks before the big walkout. The workers'\r\nranks there were already broken. In Sparrows' Point likewise several\r\ndepartments had been on strike since May 3. Not more than 500 men,\r\nprincipally laborers and tin mill workers, responded to the general\r\nstrike call; but they made a hard fight of it. In Steelton the men had\r\nbeen very strongly organized during the war; but the error was made of\r\nputting all the trades into one federal union. Then when the craft\r\nunions insisted later that their men be turned over to them, the\r\nresultant resistance of the members, and especially of the paid\r\nofficers, virtually destroyed the organization. When the strike came\r\nonly a small percentage struck, nor did they stick long.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the strike in the main plant at Bethlehem, Secretary\r\nHendricks says:\r\n\r\n      The strike was called September 29, and about 75 per cent.\r\n      of the men responded. These were largely American workers.\r\n      The Machinists, which comprise about 40 per cent. of the\r\n      total workers, were the craft most involved. In the mill and\r\n      blast furnace departments, the response was among the\r\n      rollers, heaters, and highly skilled men generally, which\r\n      led to the complete shut-down of these departments. The\r\n      molders practically shut the foundries down. Electrical\r\n      workers, steamfitters, millwrights, and general repairmen\r\n      responded well. The patternmakers did not go out.\r\n\r\nThe first break came a week later. It was charged largely to the steam\r\nengineers, who heeded the strike-breaking advice of their international\r\nofficials and returned to work. Another factor was the failure of\r\nsupport from the railroad men on the inter-plant system. Had these two\r\nbodies of men been held in line by their officers, the Bethlehem strike\r\nwould have been a success.\r\n\r\nIn the Bethlehem situation too much reliance was placed in the skilled\r\ntrades; more attention should have been given to the organization of the\r\nreal fighting force, the unskilled workers. Another mistake was to have\r\nallowed the strikes to take place in Reading, Lebanon and Sparrows'\r\nPoint. Even a tyro could see that they had no hope of success. Those\r\nmen could easily have been held in line until the big strike, to the\r\nenormous strengthening of the latter. The National Committee had little\r\nto do with the Bethlehem situation before the strike, the movement\r\ndeveloping to a great extent independently.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the strike zone was there a more bitter fight than in the\r\nBuffalo district, which was directed by organizers Thompson and\r\nStreifler. All the important plants were affected, but the storm\r\ncentered around the Lackawanna Steel Company. This concern left nothing\r\nundone to defeat its workers. For eight months it had prevented any\r\nmeetings from being held in Lackawanna, and then, when the workers broke\r\nthrough this obstruction and crowded into the unions, it discharged\r\nhundreds of them. This put the iron into the workers' hearts, and they\r\nmade an heroic struggle. So firm were their ranks that when the general\r\nstrike was called off on January 8, they voted to continue the fight in\r\nLackawanna. But this was soon seen to be hopeless.\r\n\r\nMuch company violence was used in the Lackawanna strike. The New York\r\nState Constabulary and the company guards, of a cut with their odious\r\nPennsylvania brethren, slugged, shot and jailed men and women in real\r\nSteel Trust style. Many strikers were injured, and two killed outright.\r\nOne of these, Joseph Mazurek, a native-born American, was freshly back\r\nfrom the fighting in France. Lackawanna was just a little bit of an\r\nindustrial hell.[16]\r\n\r\nAs a strike measure the Lackawanna Steel Company evicted many strikers\r\nfrom the company houses. In Braddock, Rankin, Homestead, Butler,\r\nWierton, Natrona, Bethlehem and many other places, the companies put\r\nsimilar pressure upon their men, either evicting them or foreclosing the\r\nmortgages on their half-paid-for houses. Threats of such action drove\r\nthousands back to work, it being peculiarly terrifying to workers to\r\nfind themselves deprived of their homes in winter time. Where evictions\r\nactually occurred the victims usually had to leave town or find crowded\r\nquarters with other strikers. The much-lauded housing schemes of the\r\nsteel companies are merely one of a whole arsenal of weapons to crush\r\nthe independence of their workers. No employer should be permitted to\r\nown or control the houses in which his men live.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Wheeling district is noted as strong union country. The\r\n\"independent\" mills therein had provided the main strength of the\r\nAmalgamated Association for several years prior to this movement; but\r\nthe Trust mills were still unorganized. Under the guidance of National\r\nCommittee local secretary J. M. Peters, however, these men, in the mills\r\nof Wheeling, Bellaire, Benwood and Martin's Ferry, were brought into the\r\nunions. On September 22 they struck 100 per cent., completely closing\r\nall the plants. They held practically solid until the first week in\r\nDecember, when they broke heavily.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of this break merits explanation. The National\r\nCommittee, at the outset of the strike, organized a publicity\r\ndepartment, headed by Mr. Edwin Newdick, formerly of the National War\r\nLabor Board. In addition to getting out strike stories for the press,\r\nmany of which were written by the well-known novelist, Mary Heaton\r\nVorse, this department assembled and issued in printed bulletin form\r\nstatistical information relative to the progress and effectiveness of\r\nthe strike. The steel companies, through spies in the unions,\r\nnewspapers, etc., disputed this information, telling the strikers that\r\nthey were being victimized as the mills in all districts except their\r\nown were in full operation, and advising them to send out committees to\r\ninvestigate the situation.\r\n\r\nIt was a seductive argument and many were deceived by it. Consequently,\r\nquite generally, such committees (usually financed and chaperoned by the\r\nlocal Chambers of Commerce) went forth from various localities. Of\r\ncourse, they returned the sort of reports the companies wished. Much\r\nharm was done thereby. The Steubenville district suffered from the lying\r\nstatement of such a committee, the strikers having made a winning fight\r\nup till the time it was made public, the middle of November. But nowhere\r\nwas the effect so serious as in the Wheeling district.\r\n\r\nThe Wheeling committee was headed by one Robert Edwards, widely known\r\nfor years as an extreme radical. It visited many points in the steel\r\nindustry, taking its figures on steel production and strike conditions\r\nfrom employers' sources, and completely ignoring national and local\r\nstrike officials everywhere. The ensuing report pictured the steel\r\nindustry as virtually normal. Although he had been recently expelled\r\nfrom the Amalgamated Association Edwards still had great influence with\r\nthe men, and his report broke their ranks. In future general strikes\r\ndrastic disciplinary measures should be taken to forestall the\r\nactivities of such committees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the 6500 men employed by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. in its Pueblo\r\nmills, 95 per cent. walked out on September 22. When the strike was\r\ncalled off three and one-half months later not over 1500 of these had\r\nreturned to their jobs. Production was below 20 per cent. of normal.\r\nLocally the tie-up was so effective that on January 9, at the biggest\r\nlabor meeting in Pueblo's history, National Committee local secretary W.\r\nH. Young and the other organizers had to beg the men for hours to go\r\nback to work. These officials knew that the great struggle had been\r\ndecided in the enormous steel centers of the East (Pueblo being credited\r\nwith producing only two per cent. of the nation's steel) and that it\r\nwould be madness for them to try to win the fight alone.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the Pueblo strike was opposition to the Rockefeller\r\nIndustrial Plan, in force in the mills. This worthless, tyrannical\r\narrangement the men could not tolerate and were determined to contest to\r\nthe end. Realizing the minor importance of the Pueblo mills in the\r\nnational strike, the men offered at the outset to waive all their\r\ndemands pending its settlement, provided the company would agree to meet\r\nwith their representatives later to take up these matters. But this was\r\nflatly refused; it was either accept the Rockefeller Plan or fight, even\r\nthough 98 per cent. of the men had voted to abolish it.\r\n\r\nShortly after this incident John D. Rockefeller, Jr., gained much\r\nfavorable comment and pleasing publicity by his glowing speech about\r\nindustrial democracy and the right of collective bargaining, delivered\r\nat the National Industrial Conference at Washington, D. C. He was hailed\r\nas one of the country's progressive employers. But when the striking\r\nPueblo workers wired him, requesting that he grant them these rights, he\r\nreferred them to Mr. Welborn, President of the C. F. and I. Company,\r\nwell knowing that this gentleman would deny their plea.\r\n\r\nThe strike was markedly peaceful throughout, no one being hurt and\r\nhardly any one arrested. But on December 28, the state militia were\r\nsuddenly brought in, ostensibly because of an attack supposed to have\r\nbeen made two days previously upon Mr. F. E. Parks, manager of the\r\nMinnequa works. The public never learned the details of this mysterious\r\naffair which served so well to bring in the troops. Nor was the\r\n\"culprit\" ever located, although large rewards were offered for his\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Johnstown strike was so complete that for eight weeks the great\r\nCambria Steel Co., despite strenuous efforts, could not put a single\r\ndepartment of its enormous mills into operation. Every trick was used\r\nto break the strike. The Back-To-Work organization[17] labored\r\nceaselessly, holding meetings and writing and telephoning the workers to\r\ncoax or intimidate them back to their jobs. Droves of scabs were brought\r\nin from outside points. But to no effect; the workers held fast. Then\r\nthe company embarked upon the usual Pennsylvania policy of terrorism.\r\n\r\nI, personally, was the first to feel its weight. I was billed to speak\r\nin Johnstown on November 7. Upon alighting from the train I was met by\r\ntwo newspaper men who advised me to quit the town at once, stating that\r\nthe business men and company officials had held a meeting the night\r\nbefore and organized a \"Citizens' Committee,\" which was to break the\r\nstrike by applying \"Duquesne tactics.\" Beginning with myself, all the\r\norganizers were to be driven from the city. Disregarding this warning, I\r\nstarted for the Labor Temple; but was again warned by the newspapermen,\r\nand finally stopped on the street by city detectives, who told me that\r\nit would be at the risk of my life to take a step nearer the meeting\r\nplace. I demanded protection, but it was not forthcoming. I was told to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL TRUST NEWSPAPER PROPAGANDA Pittsburgh _Chronicle\r\nTelegraph_, October 6, 1919.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Secretary Conboy arriving upon the scene, the two of us\r\nstarted to the Mayor's office to protest, when suddenly, in broad\r\ndaylight, at a main street corner in the heart of the city, a mob of\r\nabout forty men rushed us. Shouldering me away from Mr. Conboy, they\r\nstuck guns against my ribs and took me to the depot. While there they\r\nmade a cowardly attempt to force me to sign a Back-To-Work card, which\r\nmeant to write myself down a scab. Later I was put aboard an eastbound\r\ntrain. Several of the mob accompanied me to Conemaugh, a few miles out.\r\nThe same night this \"Citizens' Committee,\" with several hundred more,\r\nsurrounded the organizers in their hotel and gave them twenty-four hours\r\ntime to leave town. The city authorities refused to stir to defend them,\r\nand the following day organizers T. J. Conboy, Frank Hall, Frank\r\nButterworth, and Frank Kurowsky were compelled to go. Domenick Gelotte,\r\na local organizer of the miners, refused to depart and was promptly\r\narrested. Up to this time the strike had been perfectly peaceful. The\r\nshut-down was so thorough that not even a picket line was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe mob perpetrating these outrages (duly praised by the newspapers as\r\nexamples of 100 per cent. Americanism) was led by W. R. Lunk, secretary\r\nof the Y. M. C. A., and H. L. Tredennick, president of the chamber of\r\ncommerce. This pair freely stated that the strike could never be broken\r\nby peaceful means, and that they were prepared to apply the necessary\r\nviolence, which they did. Of course, they were never arrested. Had they\r\nbeen workers and engaged in a similar escapade against business men,\r\nthey would have been lucky to get off with twenty years imprisonment\r\napiece.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of weeks the organizers returned to Johnstown. Their\r\nefforts at holding the men together were so fruitful that the Cambria\r\nCompany, in its own offices, organized a new mob to drive them out\r\nagain. But this time, better prepared, they stood firm. On November 29,\r\nwhen the fresh deportation was to take place, Secretary Conboy demanded\r\nthat Mayor Francke give him and the others protection. He offered to\r\nfurnish the city a force of 1000 union ex-service men to preserve law\r\nand order. This offer was refused, and the Mayor and Sheriff reluctantly\r\nagreed to see that peace was kept. They informed the business men's mob\r\nthat there was nothing doing. It was a tense situation. Had the\r\nthreatened deportation been attempted, most serious trouble would surely\r\nhave resulted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime numbers of the State Constabulary had been sent into\r\ntown (the city and county authorities denying responsibility for their\r\npresence) and they terrorized the workers in their customary, brutal\r\nway. Eventually the result sought by all this outlawry developed; a\r\nbreak occurred in the ranks of the highly-paid, skilled steel workers.\r\nAlthough small at first, the defection gradually spread as the weeks\r\nrolled on, until, by January 8, about two-thirds of the men had returned\r\nto work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsidered nationally, strike sentiment continued strong until about the\r\nmiddle of the third month, when a feeling of pessimism regarding the\r\noutcome began to manifest itself among the various international\r\norganizations. Consequently, a meeting of the National Committee was\r\nheld in Washington on December 13 and 14, to take stock of the\r\nsituation. At this meeting I submitted the following figures:\r\n\r\n                        _Men on Strike_  _Men on Strike_\r\n        _District_         _Sept. 29_       _Dec. 10_\r\n  Pittsburgh                 25,000           8,000\r\n  Homestead                   9,000           5,500\r\n  Braddock-Rankin            15,000           8,000\r\n  Clairton                    4,000           1,500\r\n  Duquesne-McKeesport        12,000           1,000\r\n  Vandergrift                 4,000           1,800\r\n  Natrona-Brackenridge        5,000           1,500\r\n  New Kensington              1,100             200\r\n  Apollo                      1,500             200\r\n  Leechburg                   3,000             300\r\n  Donora-Monessen            12,000          10,000\r\n  Johnstown                  18,000           7,000\r\n  Coatesville                 4,000             500\r\n  Youngstown district        70,000          12,800\r\n  Wheeling district          15,000           3,000\r\n  Cleveland                  25,000          15,000\r\n  Steubenville district      12,000           2,000\r\n  Chicago district           90,000          18,000\r\n  Buffalo                    12,000           5,000\r\n  Pueblo                      6,000           5,000\r\n  Birmingham                  2,000             500\r\n  Bethlehem Plants (5)       20,000           2,500\r\n                            -------         -------\r\n                            365,600         109,300\r\n\r\n  Estimated production of steel, 50 to 60 per cent. of normal\r\n  capacity.\r\n\r\nOwing to the chaotic conditions in many steel districts, it was\r\nexceedingly difficult at all times to get accurate statistics upon the\r\nactual state of affairs. Those above represented the very best that the\r\nNational Committee's whole organizing force could assemble. The\r\nofficials of the Amalgamated Association strongly favored calling off\r\nthe strike, but agreed that the figures cited on the number of men still\r\nout were conservative and within the mark. The opinion prevailed that\r\nthe strike was still effective and that it should be vigorously\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nOn January 3 and 4, the National Committee met in Pittsburgh. At this\r\ngathering it soon became evident that the strike was deemed hopeless,\r\nso, according to its custom when important decisions had to be made, the\r\nNational Committee called a special meeting for January 8, all the\r\ninternational organizations being notified. The situation was bad.\r\nReliable reports on January 8 showed the steel companies generally to\r\nhave working forces of from 70 to 80 per cent., and steel production of\r\nfrom 60 to 70 per cent. of normal. Possibly 100,000 men still held out;\r\nbut it seemed merely punishing these game fighters to continue the\r\nstrike. They were being injured by it far more than was the Steel Trust.\r\nThere was no hope of a settlement, the steel companies being plainly\r\ndetermined now to fight on indefinitely. Therefore, in justice to the\r\nloyal strikers and to enable them to go back to the mills with clear\r\nrecords, the meeting adopted, by a vote of ten unions to five, a\r\nsub-committee's report providing that the strike be called off; that the\r\ncommissaries be closed as fast as conditions in the various localities\r\nwould permit, and that the campaign of education and organization of the\r\nsteel workers be continued with undiminished vigor.\r\n\r\nAt this point, wishing to have the new phase of the work go ahead with a\r\nclean slate, I resigned my office as Secretary-Treasurer of the National\r\nCommittee. Mr. J. G. Brown was elected to fill the vacancy. The\r\nfollowing telegram was sent to all the strike centers, and given to the\r\npress:\r\n\r\n      The Steel Corporations, with the active assistance of the\r\n      press, the courts, the federal troops, state police, and\r\n      many public officials, have denied steel workers their\r\n      rights of free speech, free assembly and the right to\r\n      organize, and by this arbitrary and ruthless misuse of power\r\n      have brought about a condition which has compelled the\r\n      National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers to\r\n      vote today that the active strike phase of the steel\r\n      campaign is now at an end. A vigorous campaign of education\r\n      and reorganization will be immediately begun and will not\r\n      cease until industrial justice has been achieved in the\r\n      steel industry. All steel strikers are now at liberty to\r\n      return to work pending preparations for the next big\r\n      organization movement.\r\n\r\n      John Fitzpatrick\r\n      D. J. Davis,\r\n      Edw. J. Evans,\r\n      Wm. Hannon,\r\n      Wm. Z.

E. A. Kirby, pastor of St. Rose Roman Catholic church of\r\nGirard, Ohio. Usually the churchmen (of all faiths) in the various steel\r\ntowns were careful not to jeopardize the fat company contributions by\r\nhelping the unions. But not these men. They realized that all true\r\nfollowers of the Carpenter of Nazareth had to be on the side of the\r\noppressed steel workers; and throughout the entire campaign they\r\ndistinguished themselves by unstinted co-operation with the unions. The\r\nservice was never too great nor the call too often for them to respond\r\nwillingly.\r\n\r\n[16] In connection with this matter it is interesting to note that after\r\nthe strike had ended the union men entered suits against the steel\r\ncompanies for heavy damages. Up to the present writing the Lackawanna\r\nSteel Company, realizing the indefensibility of the outrages, has made\r\nout-of-court settlements to the extent of $22,500.\r\n\r\n[17] These Back-To-Work organizations were formed in many steel towns;\r\ntheir purpose was to recruit scabs. They were composed of company\r\nofficials, business men and \"loyal\" workers. The companies furnished the\r\nwherewithal to finance them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nNATIONAL AND RACIAL ELEMENTS\r\n\r\n    A MODERN BABEL--AMERICANS AS SKILLED WORKERS--FOREIGNERS AS\r\n      UNSKILLED WORKERS--LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES--THE NEGRO IN THE\r\n      STRIKE--THE RACE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to prove its charge that the purpose of the steel strike was\r\ncontrary to the spirit of our institutions, the Steel Trust's great\r\npropaganda organization never ceased asserting, (1) that the strike was\r\na movement of foreigners, (2) that the Americans in the mills were\r\nopposed to it for patriotic reasons and were taking no part therein. The\r\nvicious press made much capital of these allegations, using them heavily\r\nagainst the strike. Now let us see how much truth there was in them:\r\n\r\n1. Unquestionably the foreign-born were in the majority among the\r\nstrikers; but how could it be otherwise in view of the fact that they\r\nmake up the bulk of the working force in the industry? The following\r\ntable, submitted to the Senate Committee by Mr. A. F. Diehl, General\r\nManager of the Duquesne Works of the Carnegie Steel Co., illustrates\r\nthis fact:[18]\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION OF NATIONALITIES, AS OF AUG. 1ST, 1919, FOR TOTAL PLANT,\r\nDUQUESNE WORKS\r\n\r\n  _Nationality_           _Total_    _Per cent._\r\n\r\n  American                 2,097         34.6\r\n  American (colored)         344        5.7\r\n  English                    147        2.4\r\n  Scotch                      41         .7\r\n  Welsh                       28         .5\r\n  Irish                       58         .9\r\n  Canadian                     4         .1\r\n  German                     104        1.8\r\n  French                       6         .1\r\n  Swedish                     79        1.3\r\n  Italian                    128        2.1\r\n  Greek                       23         .4\r\n  Swiss                        5         .1\r\n  Norwegian                    4         .1\r\n  Danish                       1         .0\r\n  Hollander                    1         .0\r\n  Russian                    185        3.0\r\n  Lithuanian                 201        3.3\r\n  Lattis                       3         .0\r\n  Bohemian                     3         .0\r\n  Croatian                   222        3.7\r\n  Magyar                     742       12.2\r\n  Slovak                     930       15.3\r\n  Roumanian                    7         .1\r\n  Ruthenian                   82        1.3\r\n  Bulgarian                   25         .4\r\n  Servian                    219        3.6\r\n  Polish                     246        4.0\r\n  Armenian                    34         .5\r\n  Dalmatian                    6         .1\r\n  Macedonian                  10         .2\r\n  Hebrew                      10         .2\r\n  Turkish                     80        1.3\r\n                           -----      -----\r\n  Totals                   6,075      100.0\r\n\r\nThis condition is typical of steel mills generally in the greater\r\nPittsburgh and Middle West districts, where the body of the industry is\r\nlocated. In Clairton, of 4,600 employees, divided into 39 nationalities,\r\n35 per cent. are Americans. On page 480 of the report of the Senate\r\nCommittee Steel Strike Hearings, appears a table covering the employees\r\nof the Homestead Steel Works, Howard Axle Works, and Carrie Furnaces (an\r\nindustrial unit), submitted by General Manager J. S. Oursler. It shows a\r\ntotal of 14,687 employees, of 54 nationality divisions. Of these\r\nemployees, 5,799, or 39.45 per cent. are stated to be American whites.\r\nBut as Mr. Oursler re-iterated in his testimony that he had classed as\r\nAmericans all those who had their citizenship papers, both these figures\r\nshould therefore be considerably reduced. Besides, it must be borne in\r\nmind that these several tables include the office forces, bosses, etc.,\r\nwhich are almost entirely American, and which were not involved in the\r\nstrike. In the steel districts in question it is exceedingly doubtful if\r\nover 25 per cent. of the actual workers are American-born whites. How,\r\nthen, can a general strike of steel workers be anything else than\r\nlargely a strike of foreigners?\r\n\r\n2. Regarding the alleged non-participation of Americans in the movement:\r\nAlthough in many districts where the strike was practically 100 per\r\ncent. effective, the Americans struck almost to a man with the other\r\nworkers and fought gamely to the finish, nevertheless it must be\r\nadmitted that in the main, when compared with the foreigners,[19] they\r\nmade a poor showing. To begin with they organized slowly; then they\r\nstruck reluctantly and scatteringly; and finally, they showed little\r\ntenacity as strikers. But this general sluggishness originated, however,\r\nnot in patriotic objections to the movement or lack of sympathy with its\r\naims; but chiefly because the Americans, as skilled workers, were\r\nnaturally slower and less determined in action than the foreigners, or\r\nunskilled workers.\r\n\r\nIn the steel industry the most skilled men are to be found in those\r\ntrades actually engaged in the making and rolling of iron and\r\nsteel--the melters, puddlers, shearmen, rollers, roughers, heaters,\r\nBessemer blowers, etc. These men are paid upon a tonnage basis and\r\ngenerally receive considerably higher wages than the mechanical\r\ntradesmen--bricklayers, machinists, boilermakers, riggers, firemen,\r\nengineers, electrical workers, blacksmiths, etc., who build, maintain\r\nand generally operate the plants. It is among the favored tonnage\r\ntrades that the Americans are especially intrenched.\r\n\r\nIn the old days these highly skilled workers took the initiative in the\r\nstruggle for human rights in the steel industry--the mechanical trades\r\nand unskilled workers playing a very minor part. Homestead was one of\r\ntheir great battles, only 752 of the 3800 men employed being union\r\nmembers in good-standing. They were then bold, militant and tenacious as\r\nbull dogs. But since those times they have been defeated so often, due\r\nto a weakening of their proportional strength and strategical position,\r\nthat they have lost much of the independent spirit which once\r\ncharacterized them. They now fear the power of the Steel Trust; they\r\ndread its pitiless blacklist; they hesitate to put in jeopardy their\r\ncomparatively good jobs, which they secured only after long years of\r\nservice in minor positions, and which, once lost, are so hard to regain.\r\nThey want better conditions now as much as they ever did, but they lack\r\nthe self-confidence to fight for them. All through the campaign their\r\nattitude, barring the exceptions here and there, was to wait until the\r\nlesser skilled men had so far perfected the organization as to make it\r\nseem safe for them to join it. When the strike came the unskilled\r\nworkers led the way; then came the mechanical trades; with the\r\naristocratic steel workers bringing up the rear. But in scurrying back\r\nto scab in the mills, the order was just the reverse. This was the\r\nexperience in virtually every section of the industry.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong, however, to say that the failure of American workers\r\nto participate more heartily in the movement was due solely to their\r\nfavored position in the industry. To some extent race prejudice also\r\ncame into play, especially in those districts where the organization had\r\nnot yet reached far enough up into the plants to include the skilled\r\nworkers. Everywhere American-born workingmen, unfortunately, are prone\r\nto look with some suspicion, if not contempt and hatred, upon\r\nforeigners, whom they have been taught to believe are injuring their\r\nstandard of living. The companies made the most of this. Dubbing the\r\nwalkout a \"hunky\" strike, they told the Americans that if it succeeded\r\nthe latter would have to give over to the despised foreigners all the\r\ngood jobs and shop privileges they enjoyed. Their slogan was \"Don't let\r\nthe 'hunkies' rule the mills.\" They openly circulated handbills inciting\r\nto race war. The following, from Elwood, Pa., where a National Tube\r\nCompany plant is located, is typical:\r\n\r\n                          WAKE UP AMERICANS!!\r\n\r\n      ITALIAN LABORERS, organized under the American\r\n      Federation of Labor are going to strike Monday and are\r\n      threatening workmen who want to continue working.\r\n\r\n      These foreigners have been told by labor agitators that if\r\n      they would join the union they would get Americans' jobs.\r\n\r\n      They are being encouraged by ITALIAN MERCHANTS, who are in\r\n      sympathy with them. ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP AND LET MOB RULE\r\n      THREATEN THE PEACE OF OUR TOWN?\r\n\r\nIn towns where often the foreign population is three-fourths of the\r\nwhole, such propaganda was most inflammatory. The newspapers did all\r\nthey could to make it more so. They solemnly warned of the danger of a\r\nforeign uprising and advised a campaign of militant, 100 per cent.\r\nAmericanism; which meant, on the one hand for the local authorities,\r\ngunmen, and business men to set up a reign of terror, and on the other,\r\nfor the workers all to go back to work at once. The courts and so-called\r\npeace officers did their part. They jailed, clubbed and shot the\r\nforeigners and left the Americans, even if they were strikers, in\r\ncomparative immunity. Nothing was left undone to create a race issue,\r\nand it is not surprising that many American workers, unorganized and\r\nignorant, were mislead by this and inveigled back to the mills.\r\n\r\nIt has been charged that the unions neglected the American steel workers\r\nand concentrated upon the organization of the foreigners. If anything,\r\nthe reverse is true; for by far the weight of the appeal made was to the\r\nEnglish speaking elements. Every piece of literature put out stressed\r\nheavily the English language. Of twenty-five National Committee district\r\nand local secretaries, only three were born in Europe; of a dozen\r\nAmalgamated Association organizers, not one spoke anything but English,\r\nand of the crew as a whole, over 80 per cent. were American born. By its\r\nvery nature such an organizing force had to make strong appeal to the\r\nAmerican workers. In fact, the foreigners constantly insisted upon this,\r\nbecause, strangers in a strange land, they always crave and seek\r\nAmerican co-operation in their union movements. That this co-operation\r\nwas not more in evidence in the steel campaign was the cause of much\r\nbitter complaint among them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if the Americans and skilled workers generally proved indifferent\r\nunion men in the steel campaign, the foreign, unskilled workers covered\r\nthemselves with glory. Throughout the whole affair they showed an\r\nunderstanding discipline, courage and tenacity of purpose that compared\r\nfavorably with that shown in any organized effort ever put forth by\r\nworkingmen on this continent. Beyond question they displayed trade-union\r\nqualities of the very highest type. Their solidarity was unbreakable;\r\ntheir fighting spirit invincible. They nobly struggled onward in the\r\nface of difficulties that would try the stoutest hearts. They proved\r\nthemselves altogether worthy of the best American labor traditions.\r\nThousands of them were intending to return to Europe shortly and\r\napparently had slight reason to establish good conditions here; but they\r\nfought on, many spending their little savings during the strike, and\r\nthus postponing indefinitely the long-looked-for trip to the homelands.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of the foreign workers is a bitter pill for the Steel\r\nTrust. For many years it had scoured the countries of Eastern and\r\nSouthern Europe, and packed its mills with poor, dispirited, ignorant\r\nimmigrants of three score nationalities, in the hope that it was finally\r\nsupplanting its original crew of independent American and Western\r\nEuropean workmen by a race of submissive, unorganizable slaves. And for\r\na long time this shameful policy worked well. Wages sank to nowhere;\r\nconditions became unspeakably wretched; every strike of the old-time,\r\norganized workers was smothered by an avalanche of job-hungry\r\nimmigrants.[20] But now these foreigners are waking up; in consequence\r\nof hard economic conditions, a better acquaintance with our language and\r\ninstitutions, an inherent class solidarity, the example of union men in\r\nother industries, and the social upheavals in Europe, these men are\r\nopening their eyes; and they are fast taking their place in the very\r\nfront rank of the working class fighters for industrial liberty. And now\r\nthe Steel Trust, discovering that its hoped-for-scabs are in truth\r\nhighly rebellious workingmen, is making the welkin ring with\r\ninconsistent denunciation of the \"revolutionary foreigners,\" with whom\r\njust a short while ago it was so anxious to crowd its plants. The biter\r\nhas been very badly bitten.\r\n\r\nFor the unions the nationality problem was serious throughout the entire\r\ncampaign--the employers had worked for years to make it an insoluble\r\none. Something of the situation may be gleaned when it is recalled that\r\nthe steel industry comprises hundreds of mills, scattered through a\r\ndozen states, and employing half a million workers. These speak dozens\r\nof widely differing languages, worship through many mutually\r\nantagonistic religions, and are moved by numberless racial and national\r\nanimosities. Yet the National Committee, with the skimped resources it\r\nhad in hand, had to and did weld together this vast polyglot,\r\nheterogeneous mass into a voluntary organization, kept it thinking\r\nalike, and held it in strong discipline for months in the face of the\r\nbitter opposition of the Steel Trust, which sought in every conceivable\r\nway to divide the workers by playing upon their multiplicity of fears\r\nand prejudices.\r\n\r\nIn accomplishing this huge task the first requisite was to overcome the\r\nlanguage difficulty sufficiently to permit the message of trade unionism\r\nto be brought forcefully to the many diverse elements. Because doing so\r\nwould have rendered the meetings ruinously cumbersome and unwieldy, it\r\nwas out of the question to utilize all the languages or any considerable\r\nnumber of them; so the plan was followed of using only the predominant\r\nones; the theory being that if the large bodies of workers speaking them\r\ncould be reached, they in turn would find means to influence the\r\nminorities speaking other languages.\r\n\r\nAs the various foreign groups tend strongly to colonize in certain\r\ndistricts, the basic languages spoken in a given plant, regardless of\r\nhow many nationalities work therein, ordinarily number not more than\r\nfour or five, including always English, usually a couple of the Slavic\r\ntongues (Slavish, Polish, Russian, Croatian, Lithuanian, Serbian, etc.),\r\noften Hungarian, and occasionally Italian, Roumanian or Greek. For\r\nexample, among the fifty-four nationalities in the big Homestead plants,\r\nthe principal languages spoken are, in the order of their numerical\r\nimportance, English, Slavish, Russian, Hungarian and Polish. Move these\r\npredominate language groups and you move the whole working force; that\r\nwas the system in the steel campaign. Seldom was a piece of literature\r\nissued, even for national circulation, with as many as six languages\r\nupon it; the vitally important strike call had but seven, while four was\r\nthe customary number.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five organizers who spoke these predominating languages\r\nwere put in the field. Great care was taken by the A. F. of L., National\r\nCommittee and co-operating unions to select reliable, level-headed men\r\nof influence and standing among their respective peoples, men who could\r\nbe depended upon to go along with the general program, and not to work\r\nupon some destructive side-issue of their own. Besides, efforts were\r\nmade to take every possible advantage of the fact that practically all\r\nthe foreign workers have some slight smattering of English. Accordingly,\r\nthe English-speaking organizers were coached to get rid of all\r\ntrade-union technical expressions and to confine their talks to\r\nfundamentals; to speak slowly, distinctly, and in the simplest, even\r\n\"pidjinized\" terms, to illustrate the whole with sign language, and to\r\nfollow out a system of repetition and restatement that was bound to make\r\ntheir meaning plain to the most unknowing. Such talks, while not\r\ncalculated to stir the emotions, made clear the situation and were\r\ngreatly appreciated by the foreigners, thousands of whom, during the\r\nsteel campaign, for the first time felt the pleasure and encouragement\r\nof understanding the despairingly difficult English spoken from a\r\nplatform. The steel workers' meetings were schools in practical\r\nAmericanization.[21]\r\n\r\nWith the language problem solved in even this imperfect way, the\r\npersistent advocacy of labor union principles, backed up by a few\r\nthoroughgoing, common-sense systems of organization, did the rest.\r\nGradually the great armies of linguistically, religiously, racially\r\ndivided steel workers were united into the mighty force which threw\r\nitself against the Steel Trust. In the main the foreign workers were\r\nsimple, sincere, earnest minded folk, naturally disposed to co-operative\r\neffort. While the individualistic, sophisticated American workers all\r\ntoo often attended the ball games and filled the pool rooms, the\r\nforeigners packed the union meeting halls. Their worst fault was a\r\nwoeful unacquaintance with trade-union methods. This the organizers\r\ndiligently labored to overcome by patient instruction and a faithful\r\nattendance to their duties. The general result was that the foreign\r\nworkers developed a confidence in the organizers and a loyalty to the\r\nunions, which not even the heavy shock of the loss of the strike has\r\nbeen able to destroy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe indifference, verging often into open hostility, with which negroes\r\ngenerally regard Organized Labor's activities, manifested itself\r\nstrongly in the steel campaign. Those employed in the industry were\r\nextremely resistant to the trade-union program; those on the outside\r\nallowed themselves to be used freely as strike-breakers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Immigration Commission's Report, which furnished the\r\nlatest official figures (period 1907-08), 4.7 per cent. of the total\r\nnumber of steel industry employees at that time were negroes, most of\r\nwhom were located in the Alabama and Maryland districts. Since then,\r\nhowever, considerable additions to their numbers have been made, and in\r\nmany northern mills will be found groups of them, ranging in strength\r\nfrom 1 to 20 per cent. of the whole working force. They work mostly at\r\nhard, rough, unskilled labor, especially in the blast furnace\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, these bodies of negroes took small part in the\r\nmovement. In certain districts, notably Cleveland and Wheeling, it is\r\ntrue that they organized 100 per cent. and struck very creditably; but\r\nin most places, and exactly those where their support was needed the\r\nworst, they made a wretched showing. Consider the situation, for\r\ninstance, in the Homestead Steel Works. In these plants (including the\r\nCarrie Furnaces at Rankin), of the 14,687 employees, 1,737 are negroes.\r\nMaking deductions for office forces, bosses, etc., this would make them\r\nfrom 12 to 14 per cent. of the actual workers, a most important factor\r\nindeed. During the organizing campaign, of all these men, only eight\r\njoined the unions. And of these but one struck. He, however, stayed\r\nloyally to the finish. The degree of this abstention from the movement\r\nmay be gauged when it is recalled that of the white unskilled workers in\r\nthe same plants at least 75 per cent. joined the unions, and 90 per\r\ncent. struck.\r\n\r\nThroughout the immediate Pittsburgh district, where the unions operated\r\nunder such great handicaps and had to rely so much on the initiative of\r\nthe individual workers, the same condition prevailed. In Duquesne, of\r\n344 negroes employed, not one struck; in Clairton, of 300, six joined\r\nthe unions and struck for two weeks. Of the several hundred working in\r\nthe Braddock plants, not one joined a union or went on strike; and a\r\ndozen would cover those from the large number employed in the mills in\r\nPittsburgh proper who walked out with the 25,000 whites on September 22.\r\nSimilar tendencies were shown in the Chicago, Youngstown, Buffalo,\r\nPueblo, Sparrows' Point and other districts. In the entire steel\r\nindustry, the negroes, beyond compare, gave the movement less\r\nco-operation than any other element, skilled or unskilled, foreign or\r\nnative.\r\n\r\nThose on the outside of the industry seemed equally unsympathetic.\r\nNational Committee secretaries' reports indicate that the Steel Trust\r\nrecruited and shipped from 30,000 to 40,000 negroes into the mills as\r\nstrike-breakers. Many of these were picked up in Northern cities, but\r\nthe most of them came from the South. They were used in all the large\r\ndistricts and were a big factor in breaking the strike. The following\r\nstatement illustrates some of the methods used in securing and handling\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n      Monessen, November 23, 1919\r\n\r\n      Eugene Steward--Age 19--Baltimore, Md.\r\n\r\n      My native place is Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n      I arrived in Monessen on Wednesday, November 19. There were\r\n      about 200 of us loaded in the cars at Baltimore; some were\r\n      white; and when we were loaded in the cars were told that we\r\n      were being taken to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n      We were not told that a strike was in progress. We were\r\n      promised $4.00 a day, with the understanding that we should\r\n      be boarded at $1.00 a day.\r\n\r\n      When we took the train a guard locked the doors so that we\r\n      were unable to get out, and no meals were given us on the\r\n      way, although we were promised board.\r\n\r\n      We were unloaded at Lock 4 and had a guard placed over us,\r\n      and were then marched into the grounds of the Pittsburgh\r\n      Steel Products Co. We were then told to go to work, and when\r\n      I found out that there was a strike on I got out. They\r\n      refused to let me out at the gate when I protested about\r\n      working, and I climbed over the fence, and they caught me\r\n      and compelled me to go back and sign a paper and told me\r\n      that I would have to go to work. I told them that I would\r\n      not go to work if they kept me there two years. I was placed\r\n      on a boat. There were about 200 other people there. The\r\n      guards informed me that if I made any attempt to again run\r\n      away that they would shoot me. I got a rope and escaped, as\r\n      I will not work to break the strike.\r\n\r\n             his\r\n      Eugene  X  Steward\r\n             mark\r\n\r\n      Witness Jacob S. McGinley\r\n\r\nFew, however, of the imported negro strike-breakers showed the splendid\r\nspirit of this unlettered boy. Most of them seemed to take a keen\r\ndelight in stealing the white men's jobs and crushing their strike. They\r\nclashed badly with the pickets, where picketing was allowed. And between\r\nthem and the white strike-breakers many murderous encounters occurred in\r\nthe mills, although the companies were very careful to suppress news of\r\nthese outbreaks.\r\n\r\nSo serious was the race situation in the steel strike that the National\r\nCommittee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers requested President\r\nGompers to arrange a conference between prominent negro leaders and\r\ntrade-union officials, to the end that the proper remedies may be\r\nindicated. The need for action looking towards better relations between\r\nwhites and blacks in the industrial field should be instantly patent;\r\nfor there can be no doubt but that the employing class, taking advantage\r\nof the bitter animosities of the two groups, are deliberately attempting\r\nto turn the negroes into a race of strike-breakers, with whom to hold\r\nthe white workers in check; on much the same principle as the Czars used\r\nthe Cossacks to keep in subjection the balance of the Russian people.\r\nShould they succeed to any degree it would make our industrial disputes\r\ntake on more and more the character of race wars, a consummation that\r\nwould be highly injurious to the white workers and eventually ruinous to\r\nthe blacks.\r\n\r\nFor the tense situation existing the unions are themselves in no small\r\npart to blame. Many of them sharply draw the color line, thus feeding\r\nthe flames of race hatred. This discriminatory practice is in direct\r\nconflict with the fundamental which demands that all the workers be\r\norganized, without regard to sex, race, creed, politics or nationality.\r\nIt injures Labor's cause greatly. Company agents harp upon it\r\ncontinually, to prevent negroes from joining even the organizations\r\nwilling to take them in. This was the case in the steel campaign.\r\nMoreover these same company agents cited this discriminatory practice\r\nmost effectively to induce thousands of outside colored workers to come\r\ninto the industry as strike-breakers. Such a condition cannot be allowed\r\nto persist. But to relieve it the unions will have to meet the issue\r\nhonestly and broad-mindedly. They must open their ranks to negroes, make\r\nan earnest effort to organize them, and then give them a square deal\r\nwhen they do join. Nothing short of this will accomplish the desired\r\nresult.[22]\r\n\r\nThis action by the unions will be a step in the right direction, but it\r\nalone will not solve the vexed problem. The best negro leaders must join\r\nheartily in destroying the pernicious anti-union policies so deeply\r\nrooted among their people. It is a lamentable fact, well known to all\r\norganizers who have worked in industries employing considerable numbers\r\nof negroes, that there is a large and influential black leadership,\r\nincluding ministers, politicians, editors, doctors, lawyers, social\r\nworkers, etc., who as a matter of race tactics are violently opposed to\r\ntheir people going into the trade unions. They look upon strike-breaking\r\nas a legitimate and effective means of negro advancement. Time and\r\nagain, they have seen their people, by use of it, readily work their way\r\ninto trades and industries previously firmly sealed against them by the\r\nwhite workers' and white employers' prejudices. Nor can they see any\r\nwrong in thus taking advantage of the white man, who has so brutally\r\noppressed them for centuries. On the contrary, they consider it a\r\njustified retaliation. They are in a race war. Inasmuch as the steel\r\nstrike resulted in more negroes being in the industry than was the case\r\nbefore, they look upon the outcome as a victory. For these elements, and\r\nthey are numerous and powerful among negroes, the color line clauses in\r\nthe union constitutions are meat and drink; such leaders don't want them\r\nabolished,--they make too strong an argument against the unions.\r\n\r\nConsider the situation faced by the unions in the campaign to organize\r\nthe Chicago packing houses in 1917-18. The negroes in this industry are\r\na strong factor (numbering 14,000 of a total of some 65,000 employees),\r\nand the unions were determined to organize them. But no sooner had\r\norganizers begun the work than they met the firm opposition of the negro\r\nintelligencia above-noted. These warned their people to have nothing to\r\ndo with the movement, as their interest lay in working with the packers\r\nto defeat the unions. They said that was how the negroes came into the\r\npacking industry, and that was how they would progress in it.\r\n\r\nNaturally, they repeated the accusations about white men not taking\r\nnegroes in their unions, a charge which was not true in the packing\r\nindustry. The organizers replied by launching a vigorous campaign to get\r\nthem into the unions. Then the propaganda was sent forth that the only\r\nreason the whites were willing to take the blacks into their locals was\r\nbecause the latter, being in a minority, could exert no control; that\r\nthe whites would not dare to give them a local of their own, etc. This\r\nwas met by the establishment of a negro local of miscellaneous workers\r\nin a convenient neighborhood. Then the Jim Crow cry was raised that the\r\nwhites wanted the blacks to herd by themselves. This the organizers\r\nanswered by insisting that a free transfer system be kept up between the\r\nwhite and black locals. These were affiliated with the basic\r\norganization of the industry, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher\r\nWorkmen of North America.\r\n\r\nBut even this did not satisfy; the anti-union propaganda went on\r\nundiminished and with tremendous effect. It is true that some\r\nfar-sighted negro intellectuals defended the unions; but they were as\r\nmen crying in the wilderness; the others prevailed. And although the\r\nunions kept a crew of negro organizers in the field, and won many\r\nconcessions for the packing house workers, including the eight hour day,\r\nright of collective bargaining, large increases in wages, 40 hour weekly\r\nguarantee, retroactive pay, seniority rights, etc., they have never\r\nsucceeded in organizing the negroes.\r\n\r\nThey know little of the race problem in industry who declare that it can\r\nbe settled merely by the unions opening their doors to the negroes. It\r\nis much more complex than that, and will require the best thought that\r\nconscientious whites and blacks can give it. The negro has the more\r\ndifficult part to solve, in resisting the insidious efforts of\r\nunscrupulous white employers and misguided intellectuals of his own race\r\nto make a professional strike-breaker of him. But I am confident that he\r\nwill win out and will take his place where he belongs in the industrial\r\nfight, side by side with the white worker.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Senate Committee Steel Strike Hearings, page 532.\r\n\r\n[19] In steel industry usage (followed in this book unless otherwise\r\nnoted) the term \"foreigners\" applies chiefly to the nationalities of the\r\nlater immigrations, including the Slavic races, Roumanians, Bulgarians,\r\nHungarians, Greeks, Italians and others from Eastern and Southern\r\nEurope. These are the so-called \"hunkies.\" The peoples of the earlier\r\nimmigrations--the English, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, Germans and\r\nScandinavians--who speak our language, hold good jobs, and are generally\r\nwell established, are not exactly considered Americans, but they are\r\nrarely called foreigners.\r\n\r\n[20] The brazen frankness with which this policy was carried out is\r\nillustrated by the following advertisement, which appeared in the\r\nPittsburgh _Gazette-Times_, July 15, 1909, during the big steel strike\r\nof that time:\r\n\r\n      MEN WANTED--Tinners, catchers and helpers to work in open\r\n      shops. Syrians, Poles and Roumanians preferred. Steady\r\n      employment and good wages to men willing to work. Fare paid\r\n      and no fees charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] During the great organization drive in the Chicago packing houses\r\nin 1917-18, this method was used for several months in the large local\r\nunion of car builders and repairmen, fully 90 per cent. of whom, born in\r\nEastern Europe, were supposedly non-English-speaking. As a result they\r\nacquired such confidence in their ability to use the language that they\r\ndropped the customary practice of translating all their business into\r\nseveral languages and took to using English only.\r\n\r\n[22] The Miners, Building Laborers and several other unions are taking\r\nthe lead in this direction and are getting good results. Negroes are\r\njoining their ranks in considerable numbers and are proving themselves\r\nto be excellent union men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSARIAT--THE STRIKE COST\r\n\r\n    THE RELIEF ORGANIZATION--RATIONS--SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION\r\n      --COST OF COMMISSARIAT--STEEL STRIKE RELIEF FUND--COST OF\r\n      THE STRIKE TO THE WORKERS, THE EMPLOYERS, THE PUBLIC, THE\r\n      LABOR MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all strikes the problem of keeping the wolf from the door is a\r\npressing one. Usually it is met by the unions involved paying regular\r\nbenefits of from $5.00 to $15.00 per week to each striker. But in the\r\nsteel strike this was out of the question.[23] The tremendous number of\r\nmen on strike and the scanty funds available utterly forbade it. To have\r\npaid such benefits would have required the impossible sum of at least\r\n$2,000,000 per week. Therefore, the best that could be done was to\r\nassist those families on the brink of destitution by furnishing them\r\nfree that most basic of human necessities, food. Ordinarily in strikes\r\nthe main body of men are able to take care of themselves over an\r\nextended period. The danger point is in the poverty-stricken minority.\r\nFrom them come the hunger-driven scabs who so demoralize and discourage\r\nthe men still out. Hence, to take care of this weaker element was\r\nscientifically to strengthen the steel strike, and to make the best use\r\nof the resources available.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of strikers and their incomplete organization making it\r\nmanifestly impossible for each union to segregate and take care of its\r\nown members, the internationals affiliated with the National Committee\r\n(with the two exceptions noted) pooled their strike funds and formed a\r\njoint commissariat.[24] They then proceeded to extend relief to all\r\nneedy strikers, regardless of their trades or callings, or even\r\nmembership or non-membership in the unions. To get relief all that was\r\nnecessary was to be a steel striker and in want. This splendid\r\nsolidarity and rapid modification of trade-union tactics and\r\ninstitutions to meet an emergency is probably without a parallel in\r\nAmerican labor annals.\r\n\r\nThe commissariat was entirely under the supervision and direction of the\r\nNational Committee. Its national headquarters was in Pittsburgh, with a\r\nsub-district in Chicago. Goods were shipped from these two points. In\r\nPittsburgh they were bought and handled through the Tri-State\r\nCo-operative Association, with National Committee employees making up\r\nthe shipments. In Chicago the same was done through the National\r\nCo-operative Association. As Bethlehem, Birmingham, Pueblo and a few\r\nother strike-bound towns lay beyond convenient shipping distance from\r\nthe two distributing points, the men in charge there were sent checks\r\nand they bought their supplies locally.\r\n\r\nThe General Director of the commissariat was Robert McKechan, business\r\nmanager of the Central States Wholesale Co-operative Association. He was\r\npaid by the Illinois Miners, District No. 2. He was ably assisted by A.\r\nV. Craig (Ass't. Director), Enoch Martin (Auditor--also paid by Illinois\r\nminers), Wm. Orr (Warehouse Manager), and E. G. Craig. Secretary De\r\nYoung was in charge of the Chicago sub-district. The local distributing\r\ncentres were operated altogether by National Committee local secretaries\r\nand volunteer strike committees, with an occasional paid assistant.\r\n\r\nAll told, 45 local commissaries were set up throughout the strike zone.\r\nThis elaborate organization was created and put in motion almost over\r\nnight. Within a week after Mr. McKechan arrived in Pittsburgh, he and\r\nofficials of the National Committee had devised the commissary\r\nsystem--with hardly a precedent to go by,--organized its nation-wide\r\nmachinery, and started the first shipment _en route_ to the many strike\r\ncentres. To break in this machinery, a small pro rata of provisions,\r\nbased upon the number of men on strike, was sent to each place. The\r\nfollowing week this was doubled, and each succeeding week it was\r\nincreased to keep pace with the growing need. It finally developed into\r\na huge affair. Few strikers had to be turned away for lack of food, and\r\nthese only for a short while until the necessary additional stuff could\r\nbe secured from the shipping points. Throughout the fourteen weeks it\r\nwas in operation the commissariat, despite the tremendous difficulties\r\nit had to contend with, worked with remarkable smoothness. It was one of\r\nthe greatest achievements of the entire steel campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FITZPATRICK _Chairman, National Committee for\r\nOrganizing Iron and Steel Workers._]\r\n\r\nThe wide extent of the relief work made it necessary to develop the most\r\nrigid simplicity and standardization in the apportionment of food to the\r\nstrikers. Hence, only two sizes of rations could be used; one for\r\nfamilies of five or less, and the other for families of six or more.\r\nThese were varied from time to time, always bearing in mind the cooking\r\nfacilities of the strikers and the many food likes and dislikes of the\r\nvarious nationalities. To facilitate the carrying away of the food and\r\nto make it last the better, two commissary days were held each week, in\r\neach locality. The rations were listed on large posters (white for\r\nfamilies of five or less, and green for families of six or more) which\r\nwere prominently displayed in the local commissaries in order that the\r\nstrikers could see exactly how much provisions they were entitled to.\r\nThe following are typical rations:\r\n\r\n              FAMILIES OF FIVE OR LESS\r\n\r\n      First Half Week             Second Half Week\r\n\r\n  Potatoes      15 lbs.

Milk            1 can\r\n  Milk           1 can        Syrup           1 can\r\n\r\nIt was not contended that these rations were enough to sustain\r\ncompletely the recipients' families; but they helped mightily. Few, if\r\nany, went hungry. Single men in need received a half week's rations to\r\nlast the week. The greatest care was taken to have the supplies of the\r\nbest quality and in good condition. Whatever the unions gave they wanted\r\nthe strikers to understand was in the best spirit of brotherly\r\nsolidarity.[25]\r\n\r\nThe provisions were distributed strictly according to the following card\r\nsystem:\r\n\r\n1. Identification card: An applicant requesting relief would be referred\r\nto a credentialed volunteer relief committee. If this committee deemed\r\nthe case a needy one, it would issue the striker an identification card.\r\nThis he was required to show when dealing at the commissary.\r\n\r\n2. Record card: In addition, the relief committee would write out the\r\ndata of the case upon a record card and turn it over to the local\r\nsecretary in charge of the commissary, who would keep it on file.\r\n\r\n3. Commissary card: When the applicant presented his identification card\r\nat the commissary, the local secretary, referring to the record card on\r\nfile, would make him out a commissary card, white or green, accordingly\r\nas his family was of five or less, or six or more members. This\r\ncommissary card entitled him to draw supplies.\r\n\r\nThe commissary card had a stub attached. When a striker got his first\r\nhalf week's supplies, this stub would be detached and retained by the\r\ncommissary clerk. Upon his next visit the body of the card would be\r\ntaken up. Two important purposes were served by this collection of the\r\ncommissary cards--rather than having permanent cards and merely punching\r\nthem. First, the canceled cards being sent to the commissariat national\r\nheadquarters, it proved conclusively that the strikers had actually\r\nreceived the provisions shipped to the district; and second, by\r\ncompelling the strikers to get new commissary cards each week, it\r\nenabled the local secretaries to keep in close touch with those on the\r\nrelief roll.\r\n\r\nTo lighten the load upon the many inexperienced men working in the\r\nvarious commissaries, a special effort was made to do as much of the\r\ntechnical work as possible in the main offices of the National\r\nCommittee. Otherwise the commissariat could not possibly have succeeded.\r\nThis consideration was a prime factor in restricting the buying of\r\nprovisions to Pittsburgh, Chicago and the fewest practical number of\r\noutlying points. It also caused the adoption of the package system, all\r\nbulk goods, except potatoes, being prepared for delivery before leaving\r\nthe warehouses. Likewise, the local bookkeeping was simplified to the\r\nlast degree. In fact, for the most part the secretaries in charge of the\r\ncommissaries hardly needed books at all. The whole system checked itself\r\nfrom the central points.\r\n\r\nAs an example of its working, let us suppose that the allotment of a\r\ncertain town was 1000 rations. Accordingly, there would be shipped to\r\nthat place exactly enough of each article to precisely cover the\r\nallotted number of rations. Then, if the secretary simply saw to it that\r\nhe got what he was charged with and issued his supplies carefully in the\r\nright proportions, the whole transaction would balance to a pound, with\r\nhardly a scratch of a pen from him. The bookkeeping was all done at the\r\ngeneral offices. The latter's assurances that each striker had received\r\nhis proper ration and that the right number of rations had been issued\r\nwere, in the first place, the ration posters hanging on the walls of the\r\ncommissary; and in the second, the returned canceled commissary cards.\r\nBarring an occasional slight disruption from delayed shipments, spoiled\r\ngoods, shortages, and a little carelessness here and there, the system\r\nworked very well.\r\n\r\nThe commissariat was in operation from October 26 until January 31,\r\nthree weeks after the strike had ended. It was continued through this\r\nextra period in order to help to their feet the destitute strikers who\r\nhad fought so nobly. Probably nothing done by the unions in the entire\r\ncampaign won them so much good will with the steel workers as this one\r\nact.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of operating the commissariat was $348,509.42. The\r\nsignificance of this figure stands out when it is reduced to a per man\r\nbasis. At the strike's start there were 365,600 men out, and at its\r\nfinish about 100,000. Considering that few serious breaks occurred until\r\nthe eighth to tenth weeks, a fair average for the whole period would be\r\nabout 250,000. Accordingly, this would give (disregarding the three\r\nweeks after January 8) a total relief cost of a fraction less than $1.40\r\nper man for the entire fifteen weeks of the strike, or about one day's\r\nstrike benefits of an ordinary union. Reduced to a weekly basis, it\r\namounts to but 9-1/3 cents for each striker. Just how unusually small\r\nthis sum is may be judged from the fact that the International Molders'\r\nUnion paid the few men it had on strike regular benefits of $9.00 per\r\nweek after the first week. The fact is that, except for a small,\r\nimpoverished minority, the steel workers made their long, hard fight\r\nvirtually upon their own resources.[26]\r\n\r\nTo help finance the commissariat the American Federation of Labor was\r\nrequested to issue a general appeal for funds, which it did. Then, to\r\nadd force to this call, the National Committee recruited and put in the\r\nfield a corps of solicitors, including among others, Anton Johannson, J.\r\nD. Cannon, J. W. Brown, J. G. Sause, Jennie Matyas and G. A. Gerber. At\r\na meeting in Madison Square Garden on November 8 a collection of\r\n$150,000 was taken up. Many local unions, notably those of Altoona, Pa.,\r\ngave half their local treasuries and assessed their members one day's\r\npay each. The Marine Engineers, local 33 of New York, contributed\r\n$10,000; the International Fur Workers' Union $20,000; the International\r\nLadies Garment Workers' Union, $60,000; and the Amalgamated Clothing\r\nWorkers of America, $100,000. All these donations were highly\r\npraiseworthy, but especially the last one mentioned, because the\r\norganization making it is not affiliated to, nor even in good grace\r\nwith, the A. F. of L.\r\n\r\nThe total amount collected and turned over to the National Committee was\r\n$418,141.14. This more than covered the entire cost of the commissariat,\r\nleaving $69,631.42 to be applied to other expenses. Thus, taking them as\r\na whole, the co-operating international unions in the National Committee\r\nwere not required to pay a penny to the feeding of the strikers and\r\ntheir families. The commissariat was a monument to the solidarity of\r\nLabor generally with the embattled steel workers.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the employers bitterly hated the commissaries. They sneered\r\nat the quantity and quality of the food given out by them, and in many\r\nplaces printed handbills in several languages advising the strikers to\r\ngo at once to union headquarters and demand strike benefits in cash. And\r\nby the same token, the strikers held the commissaries in high esteem.\r\nThe foreign-born among them especially, would stand around watching\r\nwith never-ceasing wonder and enthusiasm the stream of men and women\r\ncoming forth laden with supplies. To them there was something sacred\r\nabout the food. Many of them in desperate circumstances had to be\r\npractically compelled to accept it; not because they felt themselves\r\nobjects of charity, but because they thought others needed help worse\r\nthan they. They conceived the whole thing as a living demonstration of\r\nthe solidarity of labor. The giving of the food produced an effect upon\r\ntheir morale far better than could have come from the distribution of\r\nten times its value in money. The commissariat enormously strengthened\r\nthe strikers. Without it the strike would have collapsed many weeks\r\nbefore it did. Unions in future great walkouts will do well to study the\r\nsteel strike commissary plan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrikes, even the smallest, affect so many people in so many ways that\r\nit is difficult under the best of circumstances to compile accurate data\r\nupon their cost. In the case of the steel strike it is next to\r\nimpossible to do so. The great number of steel companies and the armies\r\nof men involved; the wide scope of the strike; the condition of outlawry\r\nin many steel districts; the fact that the strike was lost; the workers'\r\nnumerous nationalities and imperfection of organization--all these and\r\nvarious other factors make it exceedingly difficult, at least at this\r\nearly date, to give more than a hint of the strike's cost.\r\n\r\nIn the steel strike, as in all others, the burden of suffering fell to\r\nthe workers' lot. To win their cause they gave freely of their lives,\r\nliberty, blood and treasure. A poll of the National Committee local\r\nsecretaries yields the following list of strike dead:\r\n\r\n  Buffalo           2\r\n  Chicago           1\r\n  Cleveland         1\r\n  Farrell           4\r\n  Hammond           4\r\n  Newcastle         2\r\n  Pittsburgh        1\r\n  West Natrona      2\r\n  Wheeling          1\r\n  Youngstown        2\r\n                   --\r\n  Total            20\r\n\r\nThe killed were all on the strikers' side, except two. The above list\r\nproperly includes Mrs. Fannie Sellins. But it does not include the\r\nscores of scabs who, because of their own or other incompetent workers'\r\nineptness, were roasted, crushed to death, or torn to pieces in the\r\ndangerous steel-making processes during the strike. Although the steel\r\ncompanies were exceedingly alert in suppressing the names of these\r\nignoble victims to their greed, it is a well-known fact that there were\r\nmany of them. There was hardly a big mill anywhere that did not have\r\nseveral to its account.\r\n\r\nHow many hundreds of strikers were seriously injured by being clubbed\r\nand shot will never be known, because most of them, especially in\r\nPennsylvania, healed themselves as best they might. With good grounds\r\nthey feared that disclosing their injuries to doctors would lead to\r\ntheir arrest upon charges of rioting. The number of arrested strikers\r\nran into the thousands. But so orderly were the strikers that few\r\nserious charges could be brought against them. They were jailed in\r\ndroves and fined heavily mostly for minor \"offenses.\" Except in Butler,\r\nPa., where a score of strikers were arrested for stopping a car of scabs\r\non the way to work (framed-up by the State Police) and sent to the\r\npenitentiary, no strikers anywhere in the whole strike zone received\r\nheavy jail sentences. Considering the terrific provocations offered the\r\nmen and the extreme eagerness with which the courts punished them, this\r\nremarkable record is an eloquent testimonial to their orderliness.[27]\r\nOf course, the companies did not neglect to avail themselves of the\r\nheartless blacklist. Just now hundreds of their former employees, denied\r\nwork and forced to break up their homes and leave town, are\r\ncriss-crossing the country looking for opportunities to make new starts\r\nin life.\r\n\r\nAs for the cost to the strikers in wages, the Philadelphia _Public\r\nLedger_ of January 10, two days after the strike was called off, carried\r\na special telegram from Pittsburgh, stating (authority not quoted) that\r\nthe wage loss in that district was $48,005,060.35, specified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Clarksburg, W. Va.       $310,000.00\r\n  Wheeling District       6,100,000.00\r\n  Donora                  1,200,000.00\r\n  Steubenville dist.      2,260,000.00\r\n  Youngstown             15,500,000.00\r\n  Monessen                2,660,000.00\r\n  Brackenridge              450,000.00\r\n  New Kensington            375,000.00\r\n  McKeesport                597,869.00\r\n  Port Vue                  900,000.00\r\n  Sharon-Farrell          1,250,000.00\r\n  New Castle                705,000.00\r\n  Homestead                 737,840.00\r\n  Duquesne                   55,030.00\r\n  Johnstown               5,712,321.35\r\n  Ellwood City               35,000.00\r\n  Butler                  1,450,000.00\r\n  Aliquippa                  10,000.00\r\n  Pittsburgh              5,715,000.00\r\n  Sharpsburg, AEtna          435,000.00\r\n  Vandergrift               357,000.00\r\n  Clairton                  165,000.00\r\n  Rankin                    375,000.00\r\n  Braddock                  650,000.00\r\n\r\nTo the above, the New York _Herald_ of January 12 editorially adds an\r\nestimate of $39,000,000 for steel districts other than Pittsburgh,\r\nmaking a grand total of $87,000,000 as the strikers' wage loss. But\r\nthese figures, bearing the earmarks of Steel Trust origin, are too low.\r\nOn the basis of the minimum figures of an average of 250,000 strikers\r\nfor 90 working days (actual strike length 108 days) at $5.00 per day per\r\nman, we arrive at a total of $112,500,000.00, or $450.00 per average\r\nstriker. Doubtless these figures are also too low, but they will serve\r\nto indicate the tremendous sums of money the already poverty-stricken\r\nsteel workers were willing to sacrifice in order to change the\r\nconditions which Mr. Gary so glowingly paints as ideal.\r\n\r\nThe loss to the steel companies must have been enormous. Without doubt\r\nit runs into several hundred millions of dollars. The items going to\r\nmake up this huge bill are many and at this time impossible of accurate\r\nestimate. There must have been not only a complete cessation of profits\r\nduring the strike period, but also a vast outlay of money to finance the\r\nstrike-breaking measures, such as maintaining scores of thousands of\r\ngunmen to guard the plants; paying rich graft to employment offices and\r\ndetective agencies for recruiting armies of scabs, who, receiving high\r\nstrike wages, idled for weeks around the plants, shooting craps, playing\r\ncards, pitching quoits, and absolutely refusing to work; keeping on the\r\npayroll great staffs of office workers with nothing to do, and high paid\r\nskilled workers doing the work of common laborers; corrupting police and\r\ncourt officials to give the strikers the worst of it, etc., etc.\r\nBesides, there should be added the cost of repairing the great injuries\r\ndone the furnaces by their sudden shutting down, this item alone\r\namounting to many millions of dollars. But a more important factor than\r\nall, perhaps, in counting the cost of the strike to the companies was\r\nthe serious injury done to their wonderful producing organization by the\r\npermanent loss of thousands of competent men who have quitted the\r\nindustry; the dislocation of many thousands more from jobs for which\r\nthey were well fitted and the substitution in their places of green men;\r\nthe lowering of the men's morale generally, due to disappointment and\r\nbitterness at the loss of the strike, etc. We may depend upon it that\r\nthe companies, following out their policy of minimizing the strike's\r\neffects, will so juggle their financial and tonnage statements as to\r\nmake it impossible for years to figure out what it really cost them, if\r\nit can ever be done.\r\n\r\nThe cost to the people at large is indicated by the New York Sun, quoted\r\nby the _Literary Digest_, January 31, 1920, as follows:\r\n\r\n      There was the loss to the railroads not only in freights\r\n      from the steel plants, but in freights from general mills\r\n      and factories which, failing to get their steel supplies,\r\n      could not maintain their production and fulfill their own\r\n      deliveries. There was the loss in wages in such mills and\r\n      factories due to that failure to get their material on which\r\n      their wage-earners could work. There was the loss in such\r\n      communities to trade folk whose customers thus had their\r\n      spending power reduced by the steel strike.--Hence this loss\r\n      of steel tonnage begins at once to widen until the loss\r\n      eventually could be figured in the billions.\r\n\r\nFor the privilege of having an autocracy in the steel industry the\r\nAmerican people pay not only huge costs in unearned dividends each year,\r\nbut also, occasionally, such monster special charges as the above.\r\nGaryism is an expensive luxury.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing figures and statements merely serve to point out the\r\nimmensity of the steel strike by indicating its approximate cost to the\r\nstrikers, the steel companies, and the public. Admittedly they are but\r\nloose estimates, based upon scanty data. Absolute accuracy is not\r\nclaimed for them. The expenditures of the labor movement in the campaign\r\ncan be more closely calculated, although they, too, are far from\r\ndefinite. They fall into three general classes: (1) those by the general\r\noffice of the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers;\r\n(2) those by the A. F. of L. and co-operating international steel trades\r\nunions not through the office of the National Committee; (3) those by\r\nlocal steel workers' councils and unions from their own treasuries. Of\r\nthese the latter may be eliminated as impossible of estimation, there\r\nbeing so many local organizations involved and the after-strike\r\nconditions so unfavorable to statistics gathering. They were a minor\r\nelement of expense compared to the other two, which we will try to\r\napproximate as closely as may be.\r\n\r\n1. From the beginning of the steel campaign, August 1, 1918, until\r\nJanuary 31, 1920, the total net disbursements of the National Committee\r\nfor all purposes, after making deductions for refunds, transfers, etc.,\r\namounted to $525,702.72. This stretch of time may be divided into two\r\nparts: (a), Organizing period, from August 1, 1918, until September 22,\r\n1919--during which time virtually all the 250,000 men enrolled in the\r\ncampaign (see end of Chapter VII) had joined the unions; (b), Strike\r\nperiod, from September 22, 1919, until January 31, 1920--during which\r\ntime the heavy special strike expenses were incurred. This period is\r\nextended three weeks past the date of the strike's close, because the\r\ncommissariat was still in operation and other important strike expenses\r\nwere going on.\r\n\r\nThe total net disbursements made by the National Committee during the\r\norganizing period were $73,139.66, which amounts to a small fraction\r\nover 29 cents for each of the 250,000 men organized. The total net\r\ndisbursements of the National Committee during the strike period were\r\n$452,563.06, or $1.81 for each of the 250,000 average strikers. Adding\r\nthese two figures together gives $2.10 as the cost to the National\r\nCommittee of organizing each steel worker and taking care of him during\r\nthe whole strike.\r\n\r\n2. The disbursements of the National Committee covered general\r\norganizing and strike expenses, such as commissary, legal, rent,\r\nprinting, salaries, etc. The A. F. of L. and the co-operating\r\ninternational unions also incurred heavy expenses upon their own\r\naccount, whose chief items were for keeping organizers in the field,\r\npaying strike benefits, and making lump donations to strike-bound local\r\nunions. At this date these expenditures may be only approximated.\r\n\r\nFor the above bodies almost the sole expense during the organizing\r\nperiod was for maintaining organizers. Forty would be a fair average of\r\nthe number of these men actually kept at the steel industry work. In the\r\nearlier part of the campaign the number was far less; in the later part,\r\nconsiderably more. The cost of maintaining them per month may be set at\r\nnot more than $400.00 each, for salaries and general expenses. Thus, for\r\nthe 13-3/4 months of the organizing period the expense to the A. F. of\r\nL. and co-operating unions for this item would be about $220,000, or 88\r\ncents per man organized. This is a top figure.\r\n\r\nDuring the strike period, on an average, 75 organizers were kept in the\r\nfield by these bodies. Due to increases in wages, etc., their upkeep\r\nshould be calculated at about $500.00 per month each. For 4-1/4 months,\r\nSeptember 22 to January 31, our strike period, this would amount to\r\n$159,375. To this should be added $100,000, which according to reports\r\nreceived approximates what the organizations paid in strike benefits and\r\ndonations direct to their strikers and not through the office of the\r\nNational Committee. This would make their total expenditures for the\r\nstrike period $259,375, or slightly less than $1.04 per striker. Adding\r\ntogether the amounts for the organizing period and the strike period, we\r\narrive at a grand total of $479,375, or $1.92 per man, spent during the\r\nentire campaign by the A. F. of L. and co-operating internationals.\r\n\r\nThe figures for the A. F. of L. and co-operating internationals are\r\nestimates,--the constant shifting of organizers during the campaign,\r\ntheir widely varying rates of pay, etc., making accuracy impossible. But\r\nfrom my knowledge of what went on I will venture that the figures cited\r\nare close enough to the reality to give a fair conception of this class\r\nof expenditures.\r\n\r\nCombining the National Committee expenditures with those of the A. F. of\r\nL. and co-operating unions, we arrive at the following totals:\r\n\r\n  ORGANIZING PERIOD:\r\n                                _Expenditures_             _Per Man_\r\n    By Nat.

Com.,    -------------------------   ------------\r\n      A. F. L. & Unions                     $1,005,007.72          $4.02\r\n\r\nIn order to approximate more closely the actual cost of the campaign to\r\nthe A. F. of L. and the twenty-four co-operating internationals forming\r\nthe National Committee, the total of $479,375, figured in a previous\r\nparagraph as their independent expenditures, must be increased by\r\n$101,047.52, the amount they contributed directly to the National\r\nCommittee for organizing and for strike expenses during the course of\r\nthe campaign;[28] making a grand total outlay for them of $580,422.52.\r\nThis in turn should be reduced by $118,451.23, the amount in the\r\nNational Committee treasury on January 31, 1920. Against the remaining\r\n$461,971.29 must be checked off what the steel workers paid into these\r\norganizations in initiation fees and dues.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the co-operating internationals received directly $1.00 to\r\n$2.00 (mostly the latter) from the initiation fees of the approximately\r\n250,000 steel workers signed up during the campaign, not to speak of\r\nthousands of dollars in per capita tax from armies of dues payers over a\r\nperiod of many months, it is safe to say that their net outlay of\r\n$461,971.29 would be nearly if not altogether offset by their income. It\r\nis true that some of the organizations, like the Miners and the A. F. of\r\nL. itself made large expenditures, with little return; and that others,\r\nlike the Structural Iron Workers, broke about even; while the\r\nAmalgamated Association put a huge sum in its treasury. All things\r\nconsidered, taking the twenty-four organizations as a whole, one is not\r\nmuch wrong in saying that so far as their national treasuries were\r\nconcerned, the great movement of the steel workers, including the\r\norganizing campaign and the strike, was, financially speaking, just\r\nabout self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nWas the steel strike, then, worth the great suffering and expenditure of\r\neffort that it cost the steel workers? I say yes; even though it failed\r\nto accomplish the immediate objects it had in view. No strike is ever\r\nwholly lost. Even the least effective of them serve the most useful\r\npurpose of checking the employers' exploitation. They are a protection\r\nto the workers' standards of life. Better by far a losing fight than\r\nnone at all. An unresisting working class would soon find itself on a\r\nrice diet. But the steel strike has done more than serve merely as a\r\nwarning that the limit of exploitation has been reached; it has given\r\nthe steel workers a confidence in their ability to organize and to fight\r\neffectively, which will eventually inspire them on to victory. This\r\nprecious result alone is well worth all the hardships the strike cost\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Exceptions to this were the cases of the Molders' and Coopers'\r\nUnions. These organizations were compelled by constitutional\r\nrequirements to pay regular strike benefits. But they included only a\r\nvery small percentage of the total number of strikers.\r\n\r\n[24] The commissariat was suggested by John Fitzpatrick, as a result of\r\nhis experiences in the Chicago Garment Workers' strike of a decade ago.\r\n\r\n[25] In addition to the regular commissaries, the local organizations,\r\ngrace to their own funds or occasional donations from their\r\ninternational unions, had relief enterprises of various sorts, such as\r\nsoup kitchens, milk, clothes, rent and sickness funds. In Monessen and\r\nDonora the strikers actually served a big turkey dinner on Thanksgiving\r\nDay. Strikers paid five cents a plate for all they wished to eat.\r\nSympathizers donated liberally according to their means. But the\r\ncommissary system was the main source of strike relief.\r\n\r\n[26] It is true, as noted above, that several other unions besides the\r\nMolders and Coopers made occasional contributions to their strike-bound\r\nlocals, but when measured against the vast armies of strikers, these\r\nfunds dwindled almost into insignificance.\r\n\r\n[27] This was largely because the men were sober. In fact, prohibition\r\nhelped the steel campaign in several important respects; (1) because\r\nhaving no saloons to drown their troubles in, the workers, clear-headed,\r\nattended the union meetings and organized more readily; (2) when the\r\nstrike came they did not waste their few pennies on liquor and then run\r\nback to work in the old way; they bought food with them and stayed on\r\nstrike; (3) being sober, they were the better able to avoid useless\r\nviolence and to conduct their strike effectively.\r\n\r\n[28] This sum represents the actual cash given by these affiliated\r\norganizations directly to the National Committee throughout the entire\r\nmovement.

I do not blame the failure of the\r\nstrike upon these factors. I put the responsibility upon the shoulders\r\nof Organized Labor. Had it but stirred a little the steel workers would\r\nhave won their battle, despite all the Steel Trust could do to prevent\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBy this I mean no harsh criticism. On the contrary, I am the first to\r\nassert that the effort put forth in the steel campaign was wonderful,\r\nfar surpassing anything ever done in the industry before, and marking a\r\ntremendous advance in trade-union tactics. Yet it was not enough, and it\r\nrepresented only a fraction of the power the unions should and could\r\nhave thrown into the fight. The organization of the steel industry\r\nshould have been a special order of business for the whole labor\r\nmovement. But unfortunately it was not. The big men of Labor could not\r\nbe sufficiently awakened to its supreme importance to induce them to sit\r\ndeterminedly into the National Committee meetings and to give the\r\nmovement the abundant moral and financial backing so essential to its\r\nsuccess. Official pessimism, bred of thirty years of trade-union failure\r\nin the steel industry, hung like a mill-stone about the neck of the\r\nmovement in all its stages.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset this pessimism and lack of faith dealt the movement a\r\nfatal blow. When the unions failed to follow the original plan of the\r\ncampaign (outlined in Chapter III) to throw a large crew of organizers\r\ninto the field at the beginning and thus force a settlement with the\r\nsteel companies during war time, as they could easily have done, they\r\nmade a monumental blunder, one for which Organized Labor will pay\r\ndearly. Notwithstanding all their best efforts in the long, bitter\r\norganizing campaign and the great strike, the organizers could not\r\novercome its effects. It was a lost opportunity that unquestionably cost\r\nthe unionization of the steel industry.\r\n\r\nAnd the same pessimism which caused this original deadly mistake made\r\nitself felt all through the steel campaign, by so restricting the\r\nresources furnished the National Committee as to practically kill all\r\nchance of success. Probably no big modern trade-union organizing\r\ncampaign and strike has been conducted upon such slender means.\r\nConsidering the great number of men involved, the viciousness of the\r\nopposition and the long duration of the movement (18 months), the\r\nfigure cited in the previous chapter as covering the general expenses,\r\n$1,005,007.72, is unusually low. It amounts to but $4.02 per man, or\r\nhardly a half week's strike benefits for each. Compared to the sums\r\nspent in other industrial struggles, it is proportionally insignificant.\r\nFor example, in the great coal miners' strike in Colorado, begun\r\nSeptember 23, 1913, and ended December 10, 1914, the United Mine Workers\r\nare authoritatively stated to have spent about $5,000,000.00 As there\r\nwere on an average about 12,000 strikers, this would make the cost\r\nsomewhere about $400.00 per man involved. And in those days a dollar was\r\nworth twice as much as during the steel strike. Had a fraction of such\r\namounts been available to the steel workers they would have made\r\nincomparably a better fight.\r\n\r\nThe unions affiliated with the National Committee have at least two\r\nmillion members. Even if they had spent outright the total sum required\r\nto carry on the organizing campaign and strike it would not have\r\nstrained them appreciably. But they did not spend it, nor any\r\nconsiderable part of it. In the previous chapter we have seen that with\r\ndonations from the labor movement at large, and initiation fees and dues\r\npaid in by the steel workers, the movement was virtually self-sustaining\r\nas far as the co-operating unions were concerned--taking them as a\r\nwhole. Now, in the next campaign, all that must be different. The unions\r\nwill have to put some real money in the fight. Then they may win it.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that there was a shortage of resources in the steel campaign\r\nI include particularly organizers from the respective international\r\nunions. Of these there were not half enough. Often the National\r\nCommittee had to beg for weeks to have a man sent in to organize a local\r\nunion, the members for which it had already enrolled. Hundreds of local\r\nunions suffered and many a one perished outright for want of attention.\r\nWhole districts had to be neglected, with serious consequences when the\r\nstrike came.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the system used by many internationals in handling their\r\norganizers was wrong. They controlled them from their several general\r\nheadquarters, shifting them around or pulling them out of the work\r\nwithout regard to the needs of the campaign as a whole. This tended to\r\ncreate a loose, disjointed, undisciplined, inefficient organizing force.\r\nIt was indefensible. Now, in the next drive there are two systems which\r\nmight be used. (1) The international unions could definitely delegate a\r\ncertain number of organizers to the campaign and put them entirely under\r\nthe direction of the National Committee. This was the plan followed by\r\nthe A. F. of L., the Miners, and the Railway Carmen. It worked well and\r\ntended to produce a homogeneous, well-knit, controllable, efficient\r\norganizing force. (2) The organizers definitely assigned to the steel\r\ncampaign by the internationals could be formed into crews, each crew to\r\nbe controlled by one man and charged with looking after the needs of its\r\nparticular trade. The Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, Machinists, and\r\nElectrical Workers used this system to some extent. A series of such\r\ncrews, working vertically along craft lines while the National\r\nCommittee men worked horizontally along industrial lines, would greatly\r\nstrengthen the general movement. When the strike came it would not only\r\nbe an industrial strike but twenty-four intensified craft strikes as\r\nwell. Of the two systems, the first is probably the better, and the\r\nsecond, because of the individualism of the unions, the more practical.\r\nEither of them is miles superior to the plan of controlling the field\r\norganizers from a score of headquarters knowing very little of the real\r\nneeds of the situation.\r\n\r\nBut more than men and money, the steel workers in their great fight\r\nlacked practical solidarity from closely related trades. In their\r\nsemi-organized condition they were unable to withstand alone the\r\nterrific power of the Steel Trust, backed by the mighty capitalistic\r\norganizations which rushed to its aid. They needed from their organized\r\nfellow workers help in the same liberal measure as Mr. Gary received\r\nfrom those on his side. And help adequate to the task could have come\r\nonly by extending the strike beyond the confines of the steel industry\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nWhen the steel unions end their present educational campaign and launch\r\nthe next big drive to organize the steel workers (which should be in a\r\nyear or two) they ought to be prepared to meet the formidable employer\r\ncombinations sure to be arrayed against them by opposing to them still\r\nmore formidable labor combinations. The twenty-four unions should by\r\nthen be so allied with the miners' and railroad men's organizations that\r\nshould it come to a strike these two powerful groups of unions would\r\nrally to their aid and paralyse the steel industry completely by\r\ndepriving it of those essentials without which it cannot operate, fuel\r\nand rail transportation. How effective such assistance would be was well\r\nindicated by the speedy and wholesale shutting down of steel mills,\r\nfirst during the general strike of bituminous miners in November and\r\nDecember of 1919, and then during the \"outlaw\" railroad strike in April,\r\n1920. With such a combination of allied steel, mine and railroad workers\r\nconfronting them, there is small likelihood that the steel companies (or\r\nthe public at large) would consider the question of the steel workers'\r\nright to organize of sufficient importance to fight about. Mr. Gary\r\nmight then be brought to a realization that this is not Czarist Russia,\r\nand that the men in his mills must be granted their human rights.\r\n\r\nThat the miners and railroaders have sufficient interests at stake to\r\njustify their entrance into such a combination no union man of heart\r\nwill attempt to deny. Not to speak of the general duty of all unionists\r\nto extend help to brothers in trouble, the above-mentioned groups have\r\nthe most powerful reasons of their own to work for the organization of\r\nthe steel industry. The United States Steel Corporation and so-called\r\n\"independent\" steel mills are the stronghold of industrial autocracy in\r\nAmerica. Every union in the labor movement directly suffers their evil\r\neffects in lower wages, longer hours and more difficult struggles for\r\nthe right to organize than they otherwise would have. No union will be\r\nsafe until these mills are under the banner of Organized Labor. Beyond\r\nquestion the organization of the steel workers would tremendously\r\nbenefit the miners and railroaders. The latter cannot possibly do too\r\nmuch to assist in bringing it about. It is their own fight.\r\n\r\nFor the miners and railroad men to join forces with the steel workers\r\nwould mean no new departure in trade-unionism. It would be merely\r\nproceeding in harmony with the natural evolution constantly taking place\r\nin the labor movement. For instance, to go no further than the two\r\nindustries in question, it is only a few years since the miners\r\nnegotiated agreements and struck, district by district. Even though one\r\nsection walked out, the rest would remain at work. And as for the\r\nrailroaders, they followed a similar plan upon the basis of one craft or\r\none system. Each unit of the two industries felt itself to be virtually\r\na thing apart from all the others when it came to common action against\r\nthe employers. It was the heyday of particularism, of craft unionism\r\ncomplete. And anyone who did not think the system represented the acme\r\nof trade-union methods was considered a crank. But both groups of\r\norganizations are fast getting away from such infantile practices. We\r\nnow find the miners striking all over the country simultaneously, and\r\nthe railroad men rigging up such wide-spreading combinations among\r\nthemselves that soon a grievance of a section hand in San Diego,\r\nCalifornia will be the grievance of an engineer in Bangor, Maine. The\r\nman who would advocate a return to the old method of each for himself\r\nand the devil take the hindmost would be looked upon today, to say the\r\nleast, with grave suspicion.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent steel strike the National Committee tried to arrange a\r\njoint meeting with the officials of the miners and railroad brotherhoods\r\nto see if some assistance, moral if nothing else, could be secured for\r\nthe steel workers. But nothing came of it. In the next big drive,\r\nhowever, these powerful organizations should be allied with the steel\r\nworkers and prepared to give them active assistance if necessary. And in\r\nthe tuning and timing of movements to permit of such a condition, so\r\nthat no lots, legal or contractual, need be cut across, there are\r\ninvolved no technical problems which a little initiative and\r\nfar-sightedness on the part of the labor men in control could not\r\nreadily overcome.\r\n\r\nIn order to cover up their own inveterate opposition to Organized Labor\r\nin all its forms and activities, and to blind the workers to the real\r\ncause of the defeat, namely lack of sufficient power on the employees'\r\nside, great employing interests caused to be spread over the whole\r\ncountry the statement that the steel strike failed because of radical\r\nleadership, and that if such \"dangerous\" men as John Fitzpatrick and\r\nmyself had not been connected with it everything would have been lovely.\r\nThey were especially severe against me for my \"evil\" influence on the\r\nstrike. But somehow their propaganda did not seem to strike root among\r\nlabor men, especially those who were backing the steel campaign. The\r\nworkers are getting too keen these days to let the enemy tell them who\r\nshall or shall not be their officials; and when they see one of these\r\nofficials made the target of bitter attack from such notorious interests\r\nas the Steel Trust they are much inclined to feel that he is probably\r\ngiving them a square deal.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, and I know John Fitzpatrick took the same position\r\nregarding himself, I was willing to resign my position on the National\r\nCommittee the very instant it was indicated by those associated with me\r\nthat my presence was injuring the movement. I felt that to be my duty.\r\nBut to the last, that indication never came. When I finally resigned as\r\nSecretary-Treasurer on January 31, it was entirely of my own volition.\r\n\r\nThe avalanche of vituperation and personal abuse was started several\r\nmonths before the strike, when a traitor labor paper in Pittsburgh (one\r\nof the stripe which lives by knifing strikes and active unionists for\r\nthe employers) published articles containing quotations from the \"red\r\nbook,\" and the other stuff later bruited about in the daily press. To\r\nhear this sheet tell it, the revolution was at hand. Immediately after\r\nthe articles appeared I sent copies to the presidents of all the\r\ntwenty-four co-operating unions, with the result that almost all of\r\nthese officials wrote me, advising that I pay no attention to these\r\nattacks, but continue with my work. They seemed to consider it something\r\nof a compliment to be so bitterly assailed from such a quarter. Again,\r\nat the very moment when President Gompers was dictating his letter to\r\nJudge Gary asking for a conference (long after the above-mentioned\r\nattacks) I stated that possibly too much prominence for me in the\r\nmovement might attract needless opposition to it and I offered to resign\r\nfrom the conference committee which handled all negotiations concerning\r\nthe steel strike. But my objections were over-ruled and I was continued\r\non the committee. Moreover, at any time in the campaign a word from the\r\nexecutive officers of the A. F. of L. would have brought about my\r\nresignation. This they were aware of for months before the strike. All\r\nof which indicates that the men responsible for the organizations in the\r\nmovement were satisfied that it was being carried on according to\r\ntrade-union principles, and also that in consideration of the Steel\r\nTrust's murderous tactics in the past it was a certainty that if the\r\nopposition had not taken the specific form it did, it would have\r\nmanifested itself in some other way as bad or worse. It was to be\r\ndepended upon that some means would have been found to thoroughly\r\ndiscredit the movement.\r\n\r\nThis conviction was intensified by the unexampled fury with which each\r\nimportant move of Labor during the past year has been opposed, not only\r\nby employers but by governmental officials as well. All through the war\r\nthe moneyed interests watched with undisguised alarm and hatred the\r\nrapid advance of the unions; but they were powerless to stop it. Now,\r\nhowever, they are getting their revenge. The usual method of defeating\r\nsuch movements during this period of white terrorism is to attach some\r\nstigma to them; to question the legitimacy of their aims, and then, when\r\nthe highly organized and corrupted press has turned public sentiment\r\nagainst them, to crush them by the most unscrupulous means. It makes no\r\ndifference how mild or ordinary the movement is, some issue is always\r\nfound to poison public opinion against it.\r\n\r\nThe first important body of workers to feel the weight of this\r\nopposition was the railroad shopmen. The Railroad Administration having\r\ndilly-dallied along with their demands for several months, these\r\nunder-paid workers, goaded on by the mounting cost of living, finally\r\nbroke into an unauthorized strike in the early summer of 1919. This\r\nalmost destroyed the organizations. Officials who ought to know declared\r\nthat at one time over 200,000 men were out. Naturally the press roundly\r\ndenounced them as Bolsheviki. Upon a promise of fair treatment they\r\nreturned to work. When the matter finally came to President Wilson for\r\nsettlement, he declared that to raise wages would be contrary to the\r\nGovernment's policy of reducing the cost of living, and requested that\r\nthe demands be held in abeyance. This statement was a Godsend to all the\r\nreactionary elements, who used it to break up wage movements everywhere.\r\nThus came to grief the effort of the shopmen. Up to May, 1920, they have\r\nsecured no relief whatsoever.\r\n\r\nNext came the affair of the Boston police in September, 1919. This\r\ndeveloped from an effort of typically conservative policemen to\r\norganize. The strike was deliberately forced by the action of State\r\npoliticians, inspired by big business, in cold-bloodedly discharging a\r\nnumber of the officers of the new union and stubbornly refusing to\r\nre-instate them. When the inevitable strike occurred they labelled it\r\nnot merely an attempted revolution, but a blow at the very foundations\r\nof civilization. The press did the rest. The strike was buried beneath a\r\ndeluge of abuse, misrepresentation and vilification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GROUP OF ORGANIZERS\r\n\r\nStanding, left to right: W. Searl, F. Wilson, A. V.

During the war this body\r\nof men sent fully 60,000 members to the front in France. They bought\r\nuntold amounts of liberty bonds and worked faithfully to keep the\r\nindustries in operation. But no sooner did they make demand for some of\r\nthe freedom which they thought they had won in the war than they found\r\nthemselves crowded into a strike, and their conservative, old-line,\r\ntrade-union leaders harshly assailed as revolutionists. For instance,\r\nsaid Senator Pomerene:[29]\r\n\r\n      Years ago the American spirit was startled because a\r\n      Vanderbilt had said, \"The public be damned.\" But Vanderbilt\r\n      seems to have no patent on the phrase, or if he had it is\r\n      being infringed today by men who have as little regard for\r\n      the public welfare as he himself had. There is no difference\r\n      in kind between him and a Foster, who, aided by the extreme\r\n      Socialist and I. W. W. classes of the country, aims to\r\n      enlist under his leadership all the iron and steel workers\r\n      of a nation and to paralyze industry, or a Lewis (President\r\n      of the United Mine Workers of America), who, to further his\r\n      own ambitions, aided as he was by the same elements, calls\r\n      400,000 men out of the mines and says to the public, \"Freeze\r\n      or starve.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government condemned the strike as \"unjustifiable and unlawful\" and\r\ninvoked against it the so-called Lever law. This law, a war measure\r\nagainst food and fuel profiteers, was, when up for adoption, distinctly\r\nstated by its author, Representative Lever, and by Attorney General\r\nGregory, as not applying to workers striking for better conditions.[30]\r\nMoreover, since the armistice it had fallen into disuse,--as far as\r\nemployers were concerned; but upon the strength of it the miners' strike\r\nwas outlawed, Federal Judge Anderson issuing an injunction which\r\ncommanded the union officials to rescind the strike order and to refuse\r\nall moral and financial assistance to the strikers. Rarely has a labor\r\nunion found itself in so difficult a situation. The only thing that\r\nsaved the miners from a crushing defeat was their splendid organization\r\nand strategic position in industry. On November 11, after the union\r\nofficials had agreed to rescind the strike order, the Philadelphia\r\n_Public Ledger_ expressed an opinion widely held when it said:\r\n\r\n      The truth of the matter is that we all \"got it wrong\" on\r\n      this coal situation. This is the time to say in entire\r\n      frankness that _the Government handled the situation with\r\n      the tact, timeliness and conciliatory spirit of a German war\r\n      governor jack-booting a Belgium town into docility_.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have the unauthorized strike of the Railroad yard and road\r\nmen; this is clearly an outbreak of workers exasperated on the one hand\r\nby a constantly increasing cost of living, and on the other by dilatory\r\nmethods of affording relief. The orthodox tactics are being employed to\r\nbreak it. The Lever law, disinterred from the legislative graveyard to\r\nbeat the miners, has been galvanized into life again and is being used\r\nto jail the strike leaders. This is not all, however. Probably there\r\nnever was a big strike in this country more spontaneous and unplanned\r\nthan the one in question. But that does not worry our Department of\r\nJustice; it has just announced to a credulous world that the whole\r\naffair is a highly organized plot to overthrow the Government. Within\r\nthe hour I write this (on April 15) I read in the papers that I have\r\nbeen singled out by Attorney-General Palmer as one of the strike\r\nleaders. Eight-column headlines flare out the charge, \"PALMER BLAMES\r\nFOSTER FOR RAIL STRIKE,\" etc.[31]\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Palmer's \"penny dreadful\" plot, the local newspapers add lying\r\ndetails of their own. The Pittsburgh _Leader_, for instance, recites _in\r\nextenso_ how I returned from the West in disguise to Pittsburgh several\r\ndays ago--presumably after a trip plotting with Mr. Palmer's wonderful\r\nrevolutionaries, who not only can bring whole industries to a standstill\r\nby a wave of the hand, but can do it in such a manner that although many\r\nthousands of workers are \"in the know\" the Department of Justice never\r\ngets to hear about it until the strikes have occurred.\r\n\r\nNow the fact is that I have been so busy writing this book that I have\r\nhardly stirred from the house for weeks. Since the steel strike ended I\r\nhave not been beyond the environs of Pittsburgh. Moreover, I do not know\r\na solitary one of the men advertised as strike leaders, nor has there\r\nbeen any communication whatsoever between us. I have not attended any\r\nstrike meetings, nor have I even seen a man whom I knew to be a striker.\r\nBut of course such details are irrelevant to the Department of Justice\r\nand the newspapers. The latter boldly announce that it is officially\r\nhoped that Mr. Palmer's charges will stampede the men back to work.[32]\r\nIn fact that is their aim. These charges are a strike-breaking measure,\r\npure and simple, and have no necessary relation to truth.[33]\r\n\r\nSimilar instances might be multiplied to illustrate the extreme\r\nvirulence of the attacks on Labor in late struggles--how the press\r\nmanufactured the general strikes in Seattle and Winnipeg into young\r\nrevolutions; and how even when Mr. Gompers announced some time back that\r\nthe American Federation of Labor would continue its customary political\r\npolicy of \"rewarding its friends and punishing its enemies,\" the scheme\r\nwas denounced in influential quarters as an attempt to capture the\r\nGovernment and set up a dictatorship of the proletariat. But enough. The\r\nsteel strike was a drive straight at the heart of industrial autocracy\r\nin America; it could expect to meet with nothing less than the most\r\ndesperate and unscrupulous resistance. If the issue used against the\r\nstrike had not been the charge of radical leadership, we may rest\r\nassured there would have been another \"just as good.\" The next movement\r\nwill have to win by its own strength, rather than by the vagaries of a\r\nnewspaper-created public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut a far more pressing problem even than any of those touched upon in\r\nthe foregoing paragraphs is the one involved in the attitude of the\r\nAmalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers toward the steel\r\ncampaign. This organization withdrew from the National Committee\r\nimmediately after the strike was called off, and it has apparently\r\nabandoned trying, at least for the time being, to organize the big steel\r\nmills. Thus the whole campaign is brought to the brink of ruin, because\r\nthe Amalgamated Association has jurisdiction over about 50 per cent. of\r\nthe workers in the mills, including all the strategic steel-making\r\ntrades, without whose support the remainder cannot possibly win. Unless\r\nit can be brought back to the fold, the joint movement of the trades in\r\nthe steel industry will almost certainly be broken up, to the great glee\r\nof Mr. Gary and his associates.\r\n\r\nThis action was in logical sequence to the position taken through the\r\ncampaign by several of the Amalgamated Association's general officers.\r\nFrom the beginning, they considered the movement with pessimism, often\r\nwith hostility. It received scant co-operation from them. As related in\r\nChapter VI, they tried to get a settlement with the U. S. Steel\r\nCorporation right in the teeth of the general movement; and their\r\nfinancial support was meager, to say the least.[34] For a few weeks\r\nduring the strike movement, when victory seemed near, they displayed\r\nsome slight enthusiasm; but this soon wore off and they adopted a policy\r\nof \"saving what they could.\" They were exceedingly anxious to call off\r\nthe strike many weeks before its close, and went about the country\r\ndiscouraging the men and advising them to return to work. And even\r\nworse, they attempted to make separate settlements with the steel\r\ncompanies. The following proposed agreement, presented to (and refused\r\nby) the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at Sparrows' Point when the strike\r\nwas not yet two months old, tells its own story:\r\n\r\n\r\n      November 19th, 1919.\r\n\r\n      Agreement entered into between the Bethlehem Steel Company\r\n      of Sparrows' Point, Maryland, and its employees, governing\r\n      wages and conditions in the Sheet and Tin mills, and Tin\r\n      House Department.\r\n\r\n      1. It is agreed that the wages and conditions agreed upon\r\n      between the Western Sheet and Tin Plate Manufacturers'\r\n      Association and the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel\r\n      and Tin Workers, as agreed upon in the Atlantic City\r\n      Conference, June, 1919, will be the prices and conditions\r\n      paid to the employees in the above-mentioned departments.\r\n\r\n      2. That the company will also agree to the re-instatement of\r\n      all their former employees, such as seek employment without\r\n      any discrimination.\r\n\r\n      3. The above Agreement to expire June 30th, 1920.\r\n\r\nDuring the strike the general officers of the Amalgamated Association\r\nnever tired of telling how sacred they considered their contracts with\r\nthe employers, and did not hesitate to jeopardize the strike by living\r\nup to them most strictly. But when it came to their obligations to the\r\nother trades it was a different story. They well knew, when they tried\r\nto make separate settlements with the U. S. Steel and Bethlehem\r\nCompanies, that they were violating solemn agreements which they had\r\nentered into with the other trades in the industry, not to speak of\r\nfundamental principles of labor solidarity.\r\n\r\nThe national officials in question looked with undisguised jealousy upon\r\nthe growth to importance of other unions in the industry where their own\r\norganization had operated alone so long. They lost no love on the\r\nNational Committee. In fact more than one of their number seemed to take\r\nparticular delight in placing obstructions in its way. If they wanted\r\nto see the steel industry organized they certainly showed it in a\r\npeculiar manner. A goodly share of my time--not to speak of that of\r\nothers--was spent plugging the holes which they punched through the\r\ndike. And apparently they always had the hearty support of their fellow\r\nofficers. It is only fair to say, however, that the lesser officials and\r\nthe rank and file of the Amalgamated Association strongly favored the\r\nNational Committee movement and gave it their loyal cooperation.\r\n\r\nAs a justification for the Amalgamated Association officials' action in\r\nquitting the joint campaign, word is being sent through the steel\r\nindustry that henceforth that organization will insist upon its broad\r\njurisdictional claims and become an industrial union in fact, taking\r\ninto its ranks and protecting workers of all classes in the steel\r\nindustry. But no one familiar with the Amalgamated Association will take\r\nthis seriously. It is a dyed-in-the-wool skilled workers' union, and has\r\nbeen such ever since its foundation forty-five years ago. Its specialty\r\nis the \"tonnage men,\" or skilled iron and steel making and rolling\r\ntrades proper. All its customs, policies and instincts are inspired by\r\nthe interests of this industrial group. It has never looked after the\r\nwelfare of the mechanical trades and the common laborers, even though\r\nfor the past few years it has claimed jurisdiction over them. In its\r\nunion mills it is the regular thing to find only the tonnage men covered\r\nby the agreements, no efforts whatever being made to take care of the\r\nother workers. It is true that during the recent campaign, due to the\r\nstimulus of the National Committee, laborers were taken in; but of the\r\nway they were handled, probably the less said the better. The incidents\r\nrelated in Chapter X are typical.\r\n\r\nThat the men now at the head of the Amalgamated Association will upset\r\nthese craft practices and revolutionize their organization into a bona\r\nfide, vigorous industrial union is incredible to those who have seen\r\nthem in action. But even if the miracle happened, even if they got rid\r\nof their mid-nineteenth century ideas and methods, adopted modern\r\nprinciples and systems, and put on the sweeping campaign necessary to\r\norganize the industry, it would not solve the problem. The other unions\r\nin the steel industry are not prepared to yield their trade claims to\r\nthe Amalgamated Association, and any serious attempt by that\r\norganization to infringe upon them would result in a jurisdictional\r\nquarrel, so destructive as to wreck all hope of organizing the industry\r\nfor an indefinite period. The unions would be so busy fighting among\r\nthemselves that they would have no time, energy or ambition to fight the\r\nSteel Trust.\r\n\r\nProgress and organization in the steel industry are to be achieved not\r\nby splitting the ranks and dividing the forces, but by consolidating and\r\nextending them. The only rational hope in the situation lies in a firm\r\nfederation of all the trades in the industry, allied with the miners and\r\nrailroad men in such fashion that they will extend help in case of\r\ntrouble. The steel workers are fast recovering from their defeat. The\r\neducational campaign is getting results, and the work should be made a\r\npermanent institution until the industry is organized. For the\r\nAmalgamated Association to desert the field now is suicidal. It is\r\nworse; it is a crime against the labor movement. It will break up the\r\ncampaign and throw the steel workers, helpless, upon the mercy of Gary\r\nand his fellow exploiters. Organized Labor should not permit it. The\r\ntime is past when a few short-sighted union officials can block the\r\norganization of a great industry.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Quoted from _The Coopers' Journal_ for February, 1920.\r\n\r\n[30] For important details, see article entitled \"The Broken Pledge,\" by\r\nSamuel Gompers, in the _American Federationist_, January, 1920.\r\n\r\n[31] Pittsburgh _Post_, April 15, 1920.\r\n\r\n[32] Pittsburgh _Chronicle-Telegraph_, April 15, 1920.\r\n\r\n[33] In connection with this matter I promptly called Mr. Palmer a liar,\r\na statement which was widely carried by the press. Our would-be tyrant\r\nswallowed it. In the situation two courses were open to him: If his\r\naccusations against me were true, under his own interpretation of the\r\nLever law he was duty-bound to arrest me; and if they were not true,\r\ncommon justice demanded that he admit the incorrectness of the\r\nstatements he had sent flying through the press, attacking me. But he\r\nhas done neither. And in the meantime I have been subjected to a storm\r\nof journalistic abuse. For example, says the Donora, Pa. _Herald_ of\r\nApril 16: \"Wm. Z. Foster seems determined to have that little revolution\r\nif he has to get out and start one himself. About the best remedy for\r\nthat bird would be one of those old-fashioned hangings.\"\r\n\r\nOne can readily imagine how quickly the wheels of justice would have\r\nwhirled and how speedily the editor would have been clapped into jail\r\nwere such an incitement to murder printed in a labor journal. But When\r\nthe case in point was called to the attention of the Pittsburgh\r\nofficials of the Department of Justice they could do nothing about it.\r\nNor could those of the Post Office Department, although the Donora\r\n_Herald_ circulates through the mails. Similarly the county and state\r\nofficials could see no cause for action. Finally the opportunities for\r\nrelief sifted down to a libel suit. And what chance has a workingman in\r\nsuch a suit against a henchman of the Steel Trust in the heart of\r\nPennsylvania's black steel district?\r\n\r\n[34] In the report included at the end of Chapter VI, the Amalgamated\r\nAssociation is shown to have enrolled 70,026 members during the\r\ncampaign. But, for the reasons cited, the figure is far too low.\r\nPresident Tighe gave a better idea of the number when, testifying before\r\nthe Senate Committee, he said (Hearings, page 353) that the secretary\r\nhad told him \"that he had already issued in the neighborhood of 150,000\r\ndues cards,\" and could not get them printed fast enough. For each man of\r\nthis army of members, the national headquarters of the Amalgamated\r\nAssociation received two dollars. Yet in return the officials in charge,\r\nthroughout the entire movement, gave the National Committee directly\r\nonly $11,881.81 to work with. Of this, $3,881.81 was for organizing\r\nexpenses, and $8,000.00 was to feed and furnish legal help to the great\r\nmultitudes of strikers, half of whom were members of the Amalgamated\r\nAssociation. What strike help was extended in other directions was\r\ncorrespondingly scanty. The balance of the funds taken in is still in\r\nits treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n    THE POINT OF VIEW--ARE THE TRADE UNIONS REVOLUTIONARY\r\n      --CAMOUFLAGE IN SOCIAL WARS--RUINOUS DUAL\r\n      UNIONISM--RADICALS SHOULD STRENGTHEN TRADE UNIONS--THE\r\n      ENGLISH RENAISSANCE--TOM MANN'S WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those progressives who will look upon the steel campaign from an\r\nevolutionary standpoint--that is by a comparison with past\r\nexperiences--it will stand out in its true light as marking a great\r\nadvance in trade-union methods and practices. It is true that the unions\r\nin the campaign made many mistakes, quarreled seriously among\r\nthemselves, and put forth only a fraction of their real strength; but\r\nwhen one considers that they substituted a group of twenty-four unions\r\nfor individual action in other campaigns; established a standard\r\ninitiation fee instead of the multitude that existed before; adopted\r\nmodern methods of organizing in place of the antiquated system\r\npreviously prevailing; organized a joint commissariat, carried on a\r\nsuccessful organizing campaign and waged a great strike together, one\r\nmust admit that a tremendous stride forward has been made. The\r\nconclusion is bound to be optimistic and full of enthusiasm for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately there are large bodies of progressives who do not\r\njudge from the evolutionary viewpoint when it comes to trade unionism.\r\nThese range all the way from the mildest liberals and friends of Labor\r\nto the most extreme I. W. W.'s. They form an influential group. Theirs\r\nis the idealistic method; more or less clearly, these elements hold in\r\ntheir mind's eye a smooth-running, intelligent, imaginary \"one big\r\nunion.\" This they use as an inelastic criterion by which to judge the\r\ntrade unions. And the natural result is that, even in such cases as the\r\nsteel campaign, the unions cut a sorry figure. Their weaknesses are\r\nunduly emphasized; their progressive innovations lose their import and\r\nseem but make-shift imitations of the real thing. The conclusions are\r\nnecessarily pessimistic. The true significance of the epoch-making\r\nmovement is lost. This viewpoint is so general and its consequences so\r\nfar-reaching and detrimental, not only to the steel unions but to the\r\nwhole labor movement, that perhaps a discussion of it may not be amiss\r\nat this point.\r\n\r\nFor many years radicals in this country have almost universally\r\nmaintained that the trade unions are fundamentally non-revolutionary;\r\nthat they have no real quarrel with capitalism, but are seeking merely\r\nto modify its harshness through a policy of mild reform. They have been\r\npictured as lacking both the intelligence to want industrial freedom and\r\nthe courage to demand it. And so often have these ideas been repeated,\r\nso slight has been the inquiry into their soundness, that they have come\r\nto be accepted in a large degree by virtually the entire left wing of\r\nthe labor movement. To these ideas, more than anything else, is due the\r\ncurrent idealistic labor pessimism, the unsympathetic attitude toward,\r\nand general lack of understanding of, the trade unions.\r\n\r\nYet their falsity is readily apparent when one takes into consideration\r\nthe real situation. It is an indisputable fact that the trade unions\r\nalways act upon the policy of taking all they can get from their\r\nexploiters. They even overreach themselves sometimes, as a thousand lost\r\nstrikes eloquently testify. Their program is directly anti-capitalistic.\r\nBut let me quote from a booklet, written by myself several years ago,\r\nentitled, \"Trade Unionism; The Road To Freedom,\" page 18:\r\n\r\n      It is idle to say that the trade unions will rest content\r\n      with anything short of actual emancipation. For they are as\r\n      insatiable as the veriest so-called revolutionary unions. In\r\n      the measure that their strength increases, so do their\r\n      demands. They have sent wages up: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\r\n      dollars per day, and hours down: 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, per\r\n      day with all kinds of other concessions sandwiched in\r\n      between. And now they are more radical in their demands than\r\n      ever before in their history. Permanently satisfied trade\r\n      unions under capitalism would be the eighth wonder of the\r\n      world, outrivalling in interest the famous hanging gardens\r\n      of Babylon. They would be impossible. With its growing\r\n      power, Organized Labor will go on winning greater and\r\n      greater concessions, regardless of how profound they may be.\r\n      It is purest assumption to state that the trade unions would\r\n      balk at ending the wages system.\r\n\r\nSo far as the tendency of their demands is concerned, there can be no\r\nquestion about that to anyone who will look at them squarely; the trade\r\nunions may be depended upon always to check exploitation through the\r\nwages system as far as their power enables them. The big question is\r\nwhether or not they will be able to develop enough power to stop this\r\nexploitation altogether. As for me, I am confident that they will. In\r\nevery country they are constantly adding to and solidifying their ranks;\r\nbuilding ever more gigantic and militant combinations and throwing them\r\nathwart the exploiter's path. It is safe to say that if they cannot\r\nfinally stop him it will be because it does not lie within the realms of\r\npossibility for the working class to produce a sufficiently powerful\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, have these strongly anti-capitalistic qualities been so long\r\nand generally ignored and the trade unions considered merely as\r\npalliative bodies? In my opinion it is because they, like various other\r\naggressive social movements, have more or less instinctively surrounded\r\nthemselves with a sort of camouflage or protective coloring, designed to\r\ndisguise the movement and thus to pacify and disarm the opposition. This\r\nis the function of such expressions as, \"A fair day's pay for a fair\r\nday's work,\" \"The interests of Capital and Labor are identical,\" etc. In\r\nactual practice little or no attention is paid to them. They are for\r\nforeign consumption. The fact that those who utter them may actually\r\nbelieve what they say does not change the situation a particle. Most\r\nmovements are blind to their own goals anyway. The important thing is\r\nthe real trend of the movement, which is indisputably as I have stated\r\nabove, on the one hand constantly expanding organization, and on the\r\nother constantly increasing demands. The trade unions will not _become_\r\nanti-capitalistic through the conversion of their members to a certain\r\npoint of view or by the adoption of certain preambles; they _are_ that\r\nby their very makeup and methods. The most that can be done is to\r\nclarify their aims and intensify their efforts towards freedom.\r\n\r\nIf the trade unions instinctively throw dust in the eyes of their\r\nenemies, they do it for an altogether worthy purpose, the elevation of\r\nthe standard of well-being for the mass of the people. In the case of\r\nthe capitalist class we see the same principle applied to an utterly\r\nvicious end. The whole trend of the great employing interests is to set\r\nup an oligarchy of wealthy parasites, neither toiling nor spinning, yet\r\nfor whom the whole body of workers would be compelled to labor in\r\ndegradation and poverty. And if unopposed, they would not only bring\r\nabout this condition, but in so doing would rob the people of every\r\nright they have--free speech, free press, free assemblage, legislative\r\nrepresentation, trial by jury, and all the rest. But do they openly avow\r\ntheir purpose? Most assuredly not, for they know that powerful though\r\nthey are they would be swept away by a wave of popular opposition.\r\nTherefore, through their newspapers and innumerable other propaganda\r\nagencies, they proceed to cover up their nefarious schemes of\r\nexploitation and oppression with hypocritical cloaks of patriotism,\r\nreligion, benevolence, and the like. Their practice is one thing, their\r\npreaching something entirely different. Thus we have Garys and\r\nRockefellers actually enslaving their workers by the most brutal\r\nmethods and at the same time seeking to convince the public that what\r\nthey are trying to do is to protect these workers from union domination,\r\nto preserve to them their sacred right to work for whomever they please,\r\netc. Men such as these are knifing America and doing it in the name of\r\n100 per cent. Americanism. They are social camouflagers par excellence.\r\n\r\nThe question may be pertinently asked, why, if camouflage is such a\r\npotent weapon in social as well as military warfare, should the true\r\nnature and tendency of the trade unions be pointed out, thus stripping\r\nthe movement of its philosophic protection and leaving it bare before\r\nits enemies? The answer is that the camouflage works both ways; it\r\ndeceives friends as well as enemies. It has thus to a great extent cost\r\nthe unions the support of the whole left wing of the labor movement. Its\r\nadvantages are outweighed by its disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn what I have called the left wing of the movement there are large and\r\never-increasing numbers of workers and sympathizers who refuse to face\r\nthe prospect of a society forever based upon the wage system. They\r\ndemand an organization that is making for its abolition and the\r\nsubstitution therefor of a system of industrial justice. If they were to\r\nlook sharply, they would see that the trade-union movement is traveling\r\nfaster than any other body toward the end they wish to reach. But\r\nunfortunately, looking sharply is not their method. They habitually\r\nattach too much importance to surface indications and not enough to real\r\nresults. They go almost entirely by preambles and manifestoes.\r\nConsequently, taking the trade-union slogans at their face value and\r\nfinding them altogether unsatisfactory, they turn their backs upon the\r\ntrade-union movement and give support to the organizations which have\r\nthe sort they want, the I. W. W., the W. I. I. U., etc.\r\n\r\nThis belief, that the trade unions are inherently conservative bodies,\r\nis the basis of the strong conviction that they are hopeless and that\r\nthey must be supplanted by a new organization, aiming to abolish the\r\nwage system. The conception is found in some degree or other among\r\nvirtually all radicals. And it has done incalculable harm to the unions.\r\nIt has cost them the support of thousands of militants, of the best and\r\nmost intelligent that the working class produces. These might have done\r\na wonderful work; but their time and energies have been worse than\r\nwasted in trying to build up organizations such as the I. W. W. When one\r\nconsiders that the life of nearly every labor union depends upon the\r\nactivities of a very small fraction of its membership, it is clear that\r\nthis constant drain upon its best blood must have seriously hindered the\r\nadvance of the trade-union movement. Many have complained at the slow\r\nprogress it has made; but the marvel is rather that it has been able to\r\nprogress at all.\r\n\r\nThis devitalizing drain must be stopped, and the great body of\r\nprogressives and radicals won over to a whole-hearted support of the\r\ntrade unions. I consider this one of the most important tasks\r\nconfronting the labor movement. But it can be accomplished only by\r\ndriving home to these elements the patent facts that the trade unions\r\nare making straight for the abolition of capitalism and that they are\r\ngoing incomparably faster towards this goal than any of the much\r\nadvertised, so-called revolutionary unions, in spite of the latter's\r\nglittering preambles. They must be taught that the weaknesses of the\r\ntrade unions are but the weaknesses of the working class, and that as\r\nthe latter gradually improves in education and experience, the unions\r\nwill correspondingly take on higher forms and clearer aims. You cannot\r\nhave perfect organizations with imperfect workers to build upon. In a\r\nword, the progressives must be won over from the idealistic and utopian\r\nto the evolutionary point of view.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it must be granted that insistence upon the real goal and\r\ntendency of trade unionism will provoke the capitalist class into\r\ngreater opposition against the movement. But this will be trebly offset\r\nby the added support which the unions will get from the large numbers of\r\nmilitants who now stand apart from them because of lack of\r\nunderstanding. The power of even a few such men, proceeding\r\nintelligently along practical lines, is one of the marvels of the labor\r\nmovement. It may be confidently expected, therefore, that when the many\r\nthousands of these, now indifferent or hostile, begin to work together,\r\nsetting up their own press and systematically furthering amalgamation\r\nand federation projects to bring the unions into closer cooperation,\r\ninitiating and prosecuting organizing campaigns, retiring to private\r\nlife such officials as now find themselves at the head of the\r\nAmalgamated Association, etc., vast changes for the better are bound to\r\noccur in the labor movement.\r\n\r\nThe trade unions have cost the workers untold efforts to build, and in\r\nthe main they seem loath to give them up, despite the blandishments of\r\nutopian dual unions. Apparently, it is through the old unions that the\r\nworkers will eventually achieve their industrial freedom, save, perhaps,\r\nin such cases as the United Garment Workers, where conditions in the\r\norganization were so utterly hopeless that there was nothing to do but\r\nform a new body, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. But this was an\r\nexceptional case. Most of the unions are moving steadily onward and\r\nupward, and they have an unshakable grip upon the workers in their\r\nrespective spheres. This being so, the logical thing to do is\r\nsystematically to set about improving and strengthening them. If this is\r\ndone, then, instead of the wild, desperate, dualistic outbreaks and\r\nstrikes, which have characterized the American labor movement for years,\r\nand done it incalculable harm, the discontented rank and file will find\r\nrelief through an orderly and rapid progress within the folds of the\r\norganizations they already have. The sooner these facts are recognized\r\nthe better for American Labor.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years much has been said about the wonderful\r\nprogress being made by the English trade-union movement. This, I venture\r\nto assert, is due largely, if not altogether, to the absence among the\r\nradicals of England of the idealistic, dualistic attitude towards the\r\nunions which exists so widely here, and which has produced the I. W. W.\r\nand its great body of sympathizers. The English radicals have a better\r\nconception than ours of the trade unions; for, flesh and blood of the\r\nlabor movement, they pit their policies and energies against the\r\nconservatives, and win. They are the ones who are writing the\r\nhighly-praised programs, and driving onward the great wage movements.\r\nThey are practical and constructive. Unlike so many of our radicals they\r\ndo not waste their time and strength in empty, pessimistic criticism of\r\nthe trade unions, and in vain, foolhardy attempts to tear the whole\r\nlabor structure to pieces and to reconstruct it according to the dream\r\nof Daniel De Leon.\r\n\r\nIn England the turning point came ten years ago when she felt the great\r\nwave of sentiment for revolutionary unionism then sweeping the world.\r\nThe question was whether this movement should realize its aims through\r\nthe old unions or by starting new ones. The existing unions were\r\nnotoriously conservative. Several of our leading radicals had said they\r\nwere even more hopeless than our own organizations and strongly urged\r\nthe formation of an English I. W. W. But fortunately, Tom Mann and his\r\ncolleagues, with a deeper knowledge of trade unionism, were able to\r\nforestall this movement and to direct the strong stream of progressive\r\nthought and energy into the old unions. The result was magical. Within\r\ntwo years the great and successful strikes of the transport workers,\r\nrailroaders and miners had occurred, and the renaissance of the English\r\nlabor movement was assured. British workingmen will never realize the\r\ninvaluable service which Tom Mann rendered them in saving England from\r\nan I. W. W. dual movement, with its tremendous waste of power and its\r\nweakening effect upon the trade unions.\r\n\r\nHow long are American progressives going to continue deceiving\r\nthemselves with the words of high-sounding preambles? When are they\r\ngoing to quit chasing rainbows and settle down to real work? These are\r\nimportant considerations indeed. The hour when our militants generally\r\nadopt English methods, and turn their whole-hearted attention to\r\nbuilding up and developing the trade-union movement,--that hour will be\r\nthe dawn of a new day for American Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |             Transcriber's Note:                  |\r\n    |                                                  |\r\n    | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the     |\r\n    | original document have been preserved.           |\r\n    |                                                  |\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in the text:      |\r\n    |                                                  |\r\n    | Page   55  Monogahela changed to Monongahela     |\r\n    | Page   86  convine changed to convince           |\r\n    | Page   92  acordingly changed to accordingly     |\r\n    | Page  101  Joilet changed to Joliet              |\r\n    | Page  103  Brackenbridge changed to Brackenridge |\r\n    | Page  107  struck changed to stuck               |\r\n    | Page  125  depondent changed to deponent         |\r\n    | Page  137  Brennon changed to Brennan            |\r\n    | Page  146  Leechburgh changed to Leechburg       |\r\n    | Page  153  childen changed to children           |\r\n    | Page  205  resistent changed to resistant        |\r\n    | Page  209  compaign changed to campaign          |\r\n    | Page  233  affiiliated changed to affiliated     |\r\n    | Page  246  in changed to  it                     |\r\n    | Page  255  tweny changed to twenty               |\r\n    | Page  260  tre changed to the                    |\r\n    | Page  262  advertized changed to advertised      |\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------+",
