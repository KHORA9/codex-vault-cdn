The passengers are from every\r\nsection of the Union. There are men of talent and high integrity among\r\nus. The emigrants in the Crescent City have never been excelled,\r\nalways excepting the Pilgrim Fathers. On leaving the Pier, I noticed\r\nbut two females, who waved their handkerchiefs most gracefully, and\r\nimparted their sweetest smiles. The stewardess is the only female on\r\nboard, who is a legion, and has contributed much to make us happy.\r\nExtraordinary harmony has prevailed. All are armed to the teeth, which\r\nwarns us to respect each other. I have not heard an unfriendly word\r\nsince I left New York, nor seen a wry face, save off Cape Hatteras\r\nand while crossing the Gulf Stream in the trough of the sea, with\r\nthe wind blowing very hard. Christmas was the sickest and saddest\r\nday of my life. Tho Crescent was a perfect hospital. All were sick,\r\nincluding some of the boat’s officers, and extending even to the crew.\r\nOn the first day out, the knives and forks rattled like hail, but on\r\nChristmas, hardly a man made his appearance at table. Such sighs and\r\ngroans, and anathemas of gold—such longing for friends, and home and\r\nsafety, and such contortions as on that unhappy Christmas, I have\r\nnever seen. A countryman staggered up and down the cabin, solemnly\r\nvociferating that he had vomited a fragment of his liver, and that he\r\nmust soon die, and bade us all a most doleful farewell, and besought us\r\nto kindly remember him to his wife and children. But the surgeon came\r\nand analysed his apparently ejected liver, which proved to be a huge\r\njunk of beef which he swallowed the day previous, without mastication.\r\nThe same verdant genius asked the Captain, during the awful gale,\r\nwhat he would charge to turn round and take him back to New York. The\r\nCaptain screamed, and swallowed a large cud of tobacco, and seized a\r\nhandspike and threatened to dash the countryman’s brains upon the deck\r\nif he didn’t go below. Amid the horrors of the hurricane, the gentle\r\nand courageous stewardess gave us gruel, for which we rewarded her with\r\na purse of gold. The tempest was terrible. The ocean mountains smote\r\nthe frantic clouds, and the snowy spray of the ocean vales resembled\r\nlakes of glittering silver. The Crescent’s stern was mutilated, the\r\nbulwarks stove, the wheel-house injured, and a man washed into the\r\nprecarious sea, who was miraculously rescued by four daring men,\r\nwhom I trust the Humane Society will reward for their extraordinary\r\ncourage and humanity. His preservation caused much joy on board, and\r\nthose who saved him have been lions since. When 700 miles from Chagres,\r\nthe thermometer was 95 in the shade on deck, and in the sun or cabin\r\nthe heat was almost intolerable. The intense heat made us stare, and\r\nwonder what was in store for us when we first mounted the fiery steed\r\nof the equator. Some of the passengers were very languid, and gasped\r\nfor breath like Peytona when leading Fashion a span on the fourth heat.\r\nChagres is the Five Points in miniature, consisting of the very dregs\r\nof filth, squalid penury and human degradation. I have been reading\r\nBlunt’s Coast Pilot, and found on page 476 the following consolatory\r\nnarrative of Chagres and its fatal harbor, from the pen of Captain G.\r\nSidney Smith, of Her Majesty’s sloop Bastard: “Chagres is more sickly\r\nthan the same latitude on the coast of Africa. The bar of Chagres\r\nharbor has two and a-half fathoms on it at low water. The entrance is\r\nrather difficult, and at all times requires a fair wind, but when in\r\nyou are perfectly safe. (O, me! O, Jonah!) I would not recommend its\r\nbeing entered if the measure could possibly be avoided, or suffer the\r\nboats to be there at night. It is, perhaps, the most unhealthy place\r\nknown. The Bastard’s cutter was, by stress of weather, obliged to\r\nstay at night in the harbor. The consequent loss was a Lieutenant and\r\nseven men. Only one of the number attacked recovered. This happened\r\nbetween the 27th and 30th of November, 1827.” We approached Chagres\r\nthis morning, amid torrents of rain. The land for 20 miles was high\r\nand undulating, with occasional bluffs towering high above the general\r\nelevation, and rocks some distance from the shore. The American Consul\r\narrived to-day, at Chagres, and in crossing the Isthmus sunk into the\r\nmud nearly up to his hat, mule and all. There are about 50 huts at\r\nChagres, with a population of about 300. An alligator snapped at our\r\nboat, near Moro Castle, while approaching the shore, and we learn that\r\nthe banks of the river are literally covered with hideous reptiles. The\r\nCastle is very dilapidated, and about 200 years old, and has within its\r\ndismal walls some 80 brass pieces, with no soldiers, and a family of\r\nnatives. A large sample of all the abominable reptiles with which these\r\nfatal latitudes abound, lurk within and around it. Board at Chagres is\r\n$5 per day, in a common hut. We are about to draw lots for the first\r\nopportunity of ascending the river. I shall endeavor to be faithful in\r\nmy narratives, during my entire pilgrimage. Adieu.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LATOON, twelve miles from Chagres,\r\n  6, P. M., in the doorway of a hut.\r\n\r\n_James Gordon Bennett_: Four of us left Chagres, at 12, M., to-day,\r\nin a canoe about 25 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 18 inches deep. Our\r\naverage weight is 160 pounds. We have three boatmen averaging 140\r\npounds each. Our baggage weighs about 800 pounds—total, 1,860 pounds.\r\nIn high water, as now, in consequence of heavy rains, the oarsmen\r\npaddle against a current of six miles. Our canoe has a thatch covering\r\ncomposed of bamboo leaves and canvass. You cannot sit upright with a\r\nhat on, in the canoe, but must lie or rest on your elbow. The thatch\r\nroof is about two feet six inches from the bottom of the canoe, and\r\nabout eight feet long, under which four of us sit and lie in a most\r\nuncomfortable position, with the air very close, and ants, and white,\r\ngreen and red spiders, and gallinippers, crawling all over us, with\r\nalligators snapping at us occasionally (when we look over the sides of\r\nthe canoe), with now and then a hideous water snake leaping into the\r\ncanoe, when nearly on its beam ends. The rain has poured in torrents\r\nsince we left, and after “_tea_,” (good heavens! what tea!) at the\r\nhouse, or hut, or hog-pen, of one of our boatmen, at Latoon, embark\r\nfor the night on our journey towards Gorgona, Cruces and Panama. The\r\nequator children are yelling and squalling in the contiguous huts; the\r\npigs are squealing; the hens and ducks cackling, and the reptiles on\r\nthe banks of the river are breathing the most frightful sounds. Before\r\nme is Jamaica rum, cocoa nuts, oranges, lemons, sugar-cane and other\r\npoisonous substances, which my companions have eaten, and one of them\r\nhas already had the gripes. Latoon has some 20 huts. From Chagres to\r\nthis place I saw three or four residences on rising ground, one of\r\nwhich, contrasted with the dismal scenery of the Chagres, looked rather\r\npretty, which I espied while emerging from the most sepulchral views I\r\never beheld. Nearly all the fruits of the earth grow in wild luxuriance\r\non the banks of the Chagres, and the atmosphere is the sweetest I\r\never inhaled—fragrant even unto poison. Birds of all hues and of all\r\nclimes assemble here, and fill the air with the most delightful music.\r\nAnd yet, with all this to cheer the traveler of these burning zones,\r\nthe rain, sun, currents, shadows and malaria, and anacondas large as\r\ntrees, and the ceaseless chattering of monkeys, and growls of panthers,\r\nand snaps of alligators, render the Chagres the most infernal river in\r\nthe world. This is called the dry season, and, so far, it has rained\r\nor poured about twelve times a day. The lightning is so vivid and\r\nincessant as to produce the most brilliant, yet frightful illumination\r\nof the scenery and atmosphere, and the thunder sounds like the crash\r\nof ten thousand worlds. But I must close, as I now embark on my solemn\r\njourney for the night.—Adieu,\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In my canoe, on the Chagres, Jan 4, 1849.\r\n\r\nOur supper, last night, consisted of rice and a stew of bad meat, with\r\na sprinkling of all the fruits I have yet seen in Grenada. I smelt,\r\nbut did not eat a particle. My comrades ate freely, and they look blue\r\nthis morning. The natives poison rats with goat milk and pine apple\r\ncombined, or with bananas and brandy. Either of these combinations\r\nwill kill a man in about one hour, so I guess I shall keep a bright\r\nguard on what goes into my belly, which is rather loose and gripy\r\nto-day. To continue long wet is a matter of death in these latitudes,\r\nand if the bowels begin to degenerate, you must say your orisons\r\nimmediately. A native died one hour before our arrival, during the\r\nfifth shake of fever and ague. On reaching the canoe, last evening,\r\nto embark, we bailed it out, chopping up and casting overboard some\r\ndozen water-snakes, that had got into the canoe while at tea. Last\r\nnight was the hardest I ever passed. It rained very hard. The monkeys\r\nchattered in droves of thousands. Our boatmen sang the most doleful\r\nsongs all night. Bull frogs rent the air with their discordant sounds;\r\nthe snakes hissed, and the alligators brought their jaws together so\r\nfiercely, as to make even the forest tremble. Amid this frightful\r\nscene, with the thermometer at 97°, pent up in the veriest cubby hole\r\nyou ever saw, where we could not move or turn over without endangering\r\nour lives by upsetting the canoe—it was altogether a night of extreme\r\nsuffering to us all. We stopped at about two this morning, at a hut on\r\nthe borders of the river, where being very sleepy, we took lodging for\r\ntwo hours, for which, with three cups of coffee, we gave $1 50, and\r\ndeparted at about five o’clock. Our bed was a piece of cloth spread\r\non a bamboo floor, with a pillow about one foot long and six inches\r\nwide. It was the funniest pillow I ever saw, and we had hard work to\r\nkeep our heads upon it. When the natives supposed we were asleep, I\r\nheard some of the rascals whispering about our assassination, and I\r\nawoke my comrade from a profound snore with a severe pinch and scratch\r\nwith my long nails, when the glistening of our weapons, and a whisper\r\nbetween ourselves, and a slight movement towards arising amid the total\r\ndarkness, scattered the cowardly assassins back to their hammocks, when\r\nwe arose, and descended the ladder stairs, and paid our bill, and went\r\nto our canoe. The males and females nearly all smoke, and men, women,\r\nand children are nearly in a state of nature. Their apparel costs them\r\nvery little, and the green earth affords them, without cultivation,\r\nevery species of vegetable and animal production.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GORGONA, Jan 5, 1849.\r\n  [5½ A. M.]\r\n\r\n_James Gordon Bennett_: I thank God that I have arrived at this\r\ninfernal place, because it is the least odious of all the mud holes\r\nbetween this and Chagres. Ours was the first canoe into Gorgona. Money\r\nmade our men work for their lives. We are about to take breakfast on\r\nthe shore, and then pass on to Cruces, and will, doubtless be the\r\nfirst canoe in, and then we will try our luck over the mountains to\r\nPanama. We have had a truly awful time. The current ran against us in\r\nsome places at the rate of eight miles, and we came near upsetting\r\nseveral times. The thermometer is 99 this morning. I must close and\r\nrun to the canoe. I will write you when I get to Panama, but doubt if\r\nyou will get my letters, as every thing is uncertain. I have not eaten\r\nfor twenty-two hours, and have been lying wet in my canoe nearly ever\r\nsince I left Chagres. My health is good, but irregularity, fatigue,\r\nand loss of sleep, affect me adversely, but I shall strive to vanquish\r\nall impediments. I have acquired more practical knowledge of animate\r\nand inanimate nature, since I left you, than I have attained in all\r\nmy travels, but I have paid dearly for my information. Poor Columbus,\r\nVespucius, Robinson Crusoe, and Daniel Boon are constantly before my\r\nvision, with whom I can truly sympathise, being like them, a pioneer\r\nin the exploration of the Western Hemisphere, and its adjacent isles.\r\nI could drop a tear to-day, my feelings are so extremely pensive, and\r\nyet I wont, but, if necessary, I’ll yet brave tigers in their dens. So,\r\ngood bye.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PANAMA, NEW GRENADA,\r\n  Sunday, Jan. 17, 1849.\r\n\r\n_James Gordon Bennett_: This being a very interesting locality of the\r\nglobe, at this time, I will strive to transmit daguerreotype views\r\nof what transpires. I stopped at Cruces one night, where several\r\ndied, whose graves were dug by the natives (just below the earth’s\r\nsurface,) with little sticks and earthern bowls, which is the custom\r\nof the country. In one case, the grave was not dug long enough, and\r\nthe neck was broken by turning the head over on the breast. I found\r\nseveral American officers at Cruces, under the command of General\r\nPersifer F. Smith, who had proceeded to Panama. Finding no mules in\r\nCruces, I wandered alone in the swamps in pursuit of one, amid rain,\r\nlightning and thunder that shook the deep foundations of the earth,\r\nand made the alligators show their hideous jaws. Through a flash of\r\nlightning, I discovered a muletteer in the dark and deep perspective,\r\nwith whom, by signs and grim contortions, I contracted for a mule. The\r\ntempest twilight passed, and the mild equator stars emerged from their\r\nmysterious depths, and guided myself and muletteer from the dismal\r\nswamp. I learn from a passenger who has just entered my apartment at\r\nthe Americano, that three emigrants were buried last night in the\r\nmountains. Two more are supposed to be dying at the French hotel. God\r\nonly knows where all this will end. An aged passenger entered the gate\r\nof the city about three hours since, whose locks were as white as the\r\nuntrodden snow, crying, with uplifted arms: “My children! my children!\r\nO God! restore my beloved children.” He looked and enacted the\r\ncharacter of Lear more perfectly than I had ever seen it. The snow that\r\nfell on Grandfather Whitehead and poor old Lear, were only wanting to\r\nmake it the most harrowing scene I ever witnessed. But unfortunately,\r\nit has not snowed on the equator, since the advent of creation. The\r\nold man’s children arrived about an hour since, and I had the pleasure\r\nof bathing the father of the flock with brandy, which revived and\r\nexhilarated him, and made him dance before me quite a reel. The old\r\nfellow really danced wonderfully; I think I never saw a man of his\r\nyears step round so lively, alter I washed his exterior, and especially\r\nhis interior, with sparkling brandy. The old man has just told me that\r\na person went from his canoe into a thicket on the Chagres, and shot a\r\nmonkey, when all his tribe began to chatter wildly, and drop from the\r\ntrees upon him, and stole his hat, and scratched, and hit him severely,\r\nand finally, about 400 monkeys chased him into the Chagres, where he\r\nhad to swim for his life until he was rescued by his comrades. Although\r\nmy brandy has made the old man extremely loquacious and facetious, yet\r\nI believe his monkey story is as reliable as my snake and alligator\r\nnarratives.\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY APRIL 24 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Adam and Eve at the hymeneal altar, contemplating the interminable\r\ngenerations of sinners; like Noah surveying the horrors of the deluge;\r\nlike Julius Cæsar projecting the passage of the Rubicon; like the\r\nChristians braving the persecutions of the Jews; like William Tell,\r\nwith his bow and quiver, hurling defiance at Gesler in the mountain\r\ngorges of Switzerland; like the great Columbus going into a midnight\r\nstorm in untraversed latitudes; like the supernatural Washington going\r\ninto battle, on whose consummation the liberty of the human race\r\nimpends; like Napoleon at Helena reviewing his wondrous reign; like\r\nAndre and poor Orsini going to the scaffold, amid the tears of their\r\ncountrymen; and like the cheerful moon, in her ramble with romantic\r\nlovers through summer skies and groves of perfume, we calmly survey the\r\nhorizon in our virgin advent of to-day, although we discern a snowy\r\ncloud that resembles the terrific monsoon. But as the impetuous sun\r\ndarts through infinitude, we shall soon dash among the adversaries of\r\nintegrity and patriotism, and be as merciless as Jackson to the robbers\r\nof the toiling masses, or to the cruel Indians, or to British tyrants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have exhibited some old wares to-day, because a tried article, like\r\na winter friend, wears well. We did not deem it necessary to italicise\r\narticle and wears. And to be more specific in the Roman language,\r\nAlligators, Autobiography, William Tell, and Worms, can never expire,\r\nbut be as eternal as the garments of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator David C. Broderick challenged us to fight a duel in 1848, and\r\nCongressman John B. Haskins brought the challenge. The law might cage\r\nus if we acknowledged our acceptance of the challenge, but we will\r\npermit Broderick or Haskins to declare if we stained the mantles of\r\nGreen and Perry of Rhode Island, whose gorgeous canopy we first beheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall soon give sketches of President Buchanan, Mayor Tiemann,\r\nComptroller Flagg, members of the Common Council, the Supervisors, Ten\r\nGovernors, Commissioners of Record, Education, and Emigration, and of\r\nour New York editorial brethren, including their Secretaries. James\r\nWatson Webb being the eldest, we may start with him. We shall also\r\nsketch the lives of the newspaper venders, and give those the most\r\nimmortal characters who sell the most of our Alligators.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.—A large reward will be paid to the\r\npolicemen who will prove by affidavits, or the poll lists, that\r\nChief Matsell, the Corporation Counsel, Register, County Clerk, or\r\nCorporation Attorney, have voted for municipal, state, or national\r\nofficers, since the promulgation of our Brandon Report, on the aliens\r\nof both hemispheres. As the County Clerk and Corporation Attorney are\r\nformidable candidates for Comptroller, it is important to know if they\r\nhave been naturalized. We will bet they have not.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrespondents will address Stephen H. Branch through the Post Office,\r\nwhose editorial room will be in a house, whose floor is the green\r\nearth, and whose ceiling is the glittering dome of Heaven, until his\r\npatronage will enable him to hire commodious apartments in the central\r\nbusiness portion of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur warm and graceful salutations to the editors of New York, who clung\r\nto us in adversity, whom we will love forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PUFF OF MERIT WITHOUT CHARGE.—William W. Britt engraved our\r\nAlligator, whose widespread jaws speak for themselves in tones of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisements are ONE DOLLAR a line. The overshadowing Bonner cannot\r\nhave a page, lest he shoot the Alligator with our wadding.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall have no pictures for premature children, save the omnipotent\r\nAlligator, who can devour a lion, or swallow, an eagle without\r\ncontortion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe withered grass of Kansas not admitted in the jaws of the\r\n_Alligator_, lest it lacerate his bowels with black vomit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeware of alluring serpents in virtue’s paths, and save your money, and\r\nbuy nourishment for your wives and children.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall commence, next week, the publication of Alfred Carson’s\r\nthunderbolts at the Common Council of 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n  In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United\r\n  States for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H. Branch.\r\n\r\n  Mortals who write their lives are shy\r\n  Of crimes that wound and make them sigh;\r\n  But I’ll disclose my evil deeds,\r\n  Although my heart in sorrow bleeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in Providence, Rhode Island, July 11, 1813, and am the\r\nsecond son of Stephen and Lucretia Branch. My mother was my father’s\r\nsecond wife. My father had four wives, the last of whom survives.\r\n\r\nHistorians are liars, and gild distinguished villains, whose political,\r\nreligious, and military views harmonize with their own. Autobiographers\r\nare liars, and boast of virtues they never possessed, and conceal vices\r\nthey always cultivated. I shall divulge the whole story of my funny\r\nand mournful career. I shall meander life’s comic and dismal stream,\r\nfrom the earliest recollections of childhood to the present hour, and\r\nmoisten my manuscript with tears of mirth and sadness, as my capers\r\nand errors emerge from the mysterious realms of memory. As I advance,\r\nthe retrospect of my freaks and follies may appal, but it shall not\r\ndeter me from its proclamation to the present and coming generations.\r\nI desire to record my frivolities and foibles, that youth and age may\r\navoid them as alligators, (with hideous jaws distended,) in hot pursuit\r\nof their affrighted victims up the embankments of the Chagres, and into\r\nthe tallest trees.\r\n\r\nI did not inherit my peccadilloes, as I cannot discover a notorious\r\nsinner among my ancestors for nearly two centuries. My father was\r\none of the purest men I ever knew, and his deeds are inscribed on\r\nthe archives of Rhode Island, in letters that can never be effaced.\r\nAlthough the minds of my parents had a beautiful symmetry, yet I can\r\ntrace my eccentricity to their parents, who were as strange as Diogenes\r\nin his tub, or Zantippe in the streets of Athens torturing poor\r\nSocrates.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey was my first school-marm, and Mr. Hill my first\r\nschool-master, followed by Miss Latham, Mr. Shaw, Pettis, Osborne,\r\nRecord, Hammond, Gregg and Ainsworth, all of whom I terribly tormented.\r\nAlthough my mother died before I was seven years old, yet I remember\r\nthe trouble I gave her, and how I cried when the messenger came to the\r\nschool-house, and told me of her sudden death, and how my father and\r\naunt Lucy wept on my arrival home. My father’s third wife was my first\r\nstep-mother, and although she was very kind, yet there was a melancholy\r\nvacuum in my home, and at eight years old, I sought diversion at the\r\ncircus and theatre, and resolved to be a circus-rider, and ground and\r\nlofty tumbler. But a fall from my horse while standing on one leg, and\r\nserious bruises while striving to turn summersets, disgusted me with\r\nthe circus, and I determined to be an actor, and carried the wardrobes\r\nof the actors to and from the theatre, for which I was admitted free.\r\nBut my father heard of it, and told me not to visit the theatre again.\r\nBut I went, and he gently whipped me. On the next night, brother Albert\r\naccompanied me to the theatre, and while I was wildly screaming at the\r\nDromios, father entered the pit and seized me, amid the convulsions\r\nof the audience and actors. On arriving home, he took us down cellar,\r\nand began to rope Albert, who instantly bellowed: “O, my salt rheum!\r\nO, spare my salt rheum!” Father then grabbed me, and I cried: “O, my\r\nboils! O, spare my boils!” when he roped me in a fresh spot, and did\r\nnot cease until he gave me my own chastisement and Albert’s too, and I\r\nnever let Ally go with me to the theatre again, as my own licking was\r\nabout as much as I could endure. But I derided father’s castigation,\r\nand the following night, I retired at nine o’clock to my bed-room, in\r\nthe second story, and tied a rope to the bed-post, and, at the peril\r\nof my life, descended the house fronting the yard, and went to the\r\ntheatre, and about midnight ascended the house, and hauled in the\r\nrope, and went to bed. In about a week, John Horsewell got locked out,\r\nand I invited him to ascend the rope and sleep with me, to which he\r\nreadily assented. In the morning, I did not rise at my usual hour,\r\nand father came to ascertain the cause, when he heard John Horsewell\r\nsnoring like thunder under my bed. He looked, and discovered John,\r\nand grabbed him by the hair, and spanked him most awfully, and while\r\nspanking poor John, I jumped from the bed, and seized my clothes, and\r\nran down stairs, and did not stop until I got into the barn, where I\r\ndressed myself, and went to school without my breakfast. After school,\r\nI prowled around the house until father left for his place of business,\r\nand then went into the house and ate my dinner. I took an early tea\r\nand went to bed; but father soon came home, and into my bed-room and\r\nseverely spanked me, and struck me several times with the very rope\r\nwith which I had descended and ascended the house, muttering something\r\nabout one Haman of old, while he roped me. I then exchanged a top for a\r\nfishing-line, and told my brother William, that if he would tie one end\r\nof the line to his little toe, and throw the other out of the window,\r\nso that I could pull it and arouse him from his midnight slumber, to\r\nsoftly unlock the door and let me in after the theatrical performance,\r\nthat I would let him tie the fishing-line to my little toe on alternate\r\nnights while he went to the theatre. This plot was successful for\r\nabout two weeks, when some boys on their return from night-school,\r\ncame into our yard to get some water from our well. After one of the\r\nboys had enjoyed a delicious draught of water from our bucket, his\r\nkeen eyes rested on the plummet at the end of the fishing-line, which\r\nhe seized, and began to pull without success, when he jerked it so\r\nhard, as to snap the line, with cries of fire and murder in the second\r\nstory. Himself and little comrades seized their scholastic lanterns,\r\nand scampered for their lives. One of them was caught by a faithful\r\nwatchman and brought into our yard, when my father escorted them up\r\nstairs, where brother William was weltering in blood that flowed\r\nfrom his toe and nose, and from bruises he received while running and\r\ntumbling over chairs and tables, and other bed-room utensils, when the\r\nboy gave his last terrible jerk of the fish-line. The boy and watchman\r\nnow departed, and father put salve on William’s toe, and checked the\r\ncopious effusion of blood from his nose, and bathed his wounds with\r\nwater and apple-jack, and put him to bed with a solitary but tremendous\r\nspank, with a promise of more when his dislocated toe was set and\r\nhealed. Father then took his ambush position in the yard, and awaited\r\nmy arrival from the theatre. I softly opened and closed the gate, and\r\nwhile feeling for the plummit, he suddenly grabbed me, and nearly\r\nscared me into the eternal world. He then led me into the barn, and\r\nilluminated the stable lantern, and took off my pants, and spanked me\r\nwith the curry-comb until the blood spurted in his face, and the horse\r\nsnorted and kicked him so hard that he had to arouse and send brother\r\nAlbert for a surgeon to dress the fearful wound. I always blessed the\r\nhumane and intelligent old horse for kicking father, and thus saving\r\nmy blood and bones, and I so intensely loved the noble animal, that I\r\nstole father’s oats, and fed him until he got so fat that I dared not\r\ngive him more lest his belly would explode, and the oats fall out, and\r\nmy theft be discovered. After my last trouncing, I became disgusted\r\nwith the theatre, and resolved to go no more to witness such nonsense.\r\nSoon afterwards, I told John Horsewell that for a dozen marbles, I\r\nwould give him some of my father’s corn, that would parch as white as\r\nsnow, and as round as hail,\r\n\r\n  And would pop as high\r\n  As the pretty sky.\r\n\r\nJohn assented, and we went up stairs to the attic, where father kept\r\nhis corn. John brought his father’s rainy hat, so that he could get\r\nmuch corn, and while I was filling it, I heard footsteps on the lower\r\nstairs that closely resembled father’s. John’s hat was about half full,\r\nand when I put it on his head, it sunk so far as to require both his\r\nhands to keep it above his eyes. We met father on the garret stairs,\r\nwhen John boldly looked up into his face, (with corn pouring down over\r\nboth ears,) and gravely exclaimed: “Mr. Branch, I aint got no corn.”\r\nFather uplifted the hat, and down went about two quarts of horse corn\r\non poor John’s head. I crawled between father’s legs, and was at the\r\nbottom of two pairs of stairs in about two strides, and away I flew to\r\nthe woods, about two miles distant, and did not return for two days,\r\nfearing that father would murder me for stealing corn so soon after my\r\nrope and fishing-line, and theatrical operations. When I next saw John,\r\nhe complained of a sore back and legs, and declared that father grabbed\r\nand wrenched a handful of his posterior pants clean off, and tore hair\r\nenough from his skull to render it slightly bald. I trembled at this\r\nintelligence, but I got cold and hungry, and went home to take my\r\nlicking, but my step-mother was ill, and she ardently plead my cause,\r\nand father forgave me.\r\n\r\n  (_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Farewell to his Country.\r\n\r\n[From the New York Daily Times, of 1856.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I have traveled all over the globe, and have no desire to rove\r\nagain, yet I am constrained to forever leave my beloved country. You\r\nmay not mourn over my departure, but I leave you with painful emotions\r\nand apprehensions. I would linger, and toil, and die among you, but\r\nyour fanaticism drives me to foreign skies. The noble deeds of my\r\nfather and his sires are inscribed on the civil and military archives\r\nof Rhode Island, whose virtues I would imitate and consecrate to the\r\nglory of my whole country; but your reckless tendency towards disunion,\r\nwith all its horrors, forces me to abjure my native land, and the\r\nhallowed tomb erected by my lamented father for the eternal repose of\r\nhis immediate posterity. Go on, then, ye fanatics and devils of all\r\nsections, to your hearts’ content, in your apostacy to the living and\r\ndeparted patriots of your distracted and divided country. Stop not\r\nuntil your wives and children run wild through streets and fields of\r\nblood, and this whole land is a pile of bleeding and burning ruins. Go\r\non ye incarnate fiends in your bloody enterprise, until the mounds of\r\nyour fathers are divested of their fragrant verdure, and are trampled\r\nby foreign marauders, who wildly gloat over your impending suicide.\r\nAn irresistible horde of demagogues and vampires, and fanatics and\r\nlunatics, are at the throats of the American patriots, and threaten\r\nthem with strangulation and utter annihilation. Go on, then, ye\r\ndemons of hell, and tear to fragments the glorious Constitution that\r\nwas created by Washington, Greene, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton,\r\nWarren, Franklin, Adams, Lafayette and Kosciusko, and nobly defended\r\nby Jackson, Perry, Taylor, Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Harrison, Grogan,\r\nDecatur, (and the living Scott), whose sighs and tears, and expiring\r\nenergies, were consecrated to its eternal duration. Go on, then,\r\nye slimy vultures, in your ruthless desecration of their graves,\r\nuntil despotic soldiers line our streets and frontiers, and stab the\r\npatriots who breathe the enchanting word of liberty. Go on, I say, in\r\nyour inhuman sacrilege, but I will fly to Switzerland, in whose deep\r\nmountain glades I will strive to efface that I was born and reared\r\namong the gang of consummate fools and knaves who now level their\r\nrifles at the race of noble birds that have graced the American skies\r\nfor nearly a hundred years. Go on, then, ye dastard traitors, in your\r\nbloody demolition, but I will go and live and die in the land of\r\nWILLIAM TELL, whose fair posterity evince a purer fidelity to their\r\nremotest ancestors, than those pernicious monsters whose infernal\r\nmadness will soon surrender the bones of WASHINGTON and JACKSON to the\r\ndespots of Europe, whose shafts they foiled, until they went down,\r\nwith tottering footsteps, into their immortal graves. Farewell, then,\r\nye crazy parricides—farewell, ye BURRS and ARNOLDS—and when you have\r\nconsigned your deluded countrymen to all the horrors of anarchy and\r\neternal despotism, think of the humble admonitions of one who, rather\r\nthan behold the downfall of his beautiful and glorious country, sought\r\npeace, and succor, and a mausoleum in the mountains of Switzerland,\r\nonce traversed by WILLIAM TELL and his gallant archers, who created\r\na love of liberty that has survived the flight of centuries, and\r\nwhich can never be subdued by foes without, nor fools within, her\r\nborders. In my voluntary exile, I will implore God to visit you with\r\nHis displeasure, through the withering curses of your children, and\r\ntheir posterity to the remotest age, for destroying the liberties of\r\ntheir country, which you should bequeathe to them as they came to\r\nyou from your illustrious fathers, whose sacred and silent ashes you\r\ndare not visit and contemplate at this fearful crisis, amid the pure\r\nand tranquil solitudes of the patriotic dead lest the memory of their\r\nheroic deeds and sacrifice should remind you of your hellish treason,\r\nand paralyze your hearts, and smite your worthless bodies to the dust,\r\nand consign your pallid livers to undying torture. Although these\r\nadmonitions are inscribed in tones of burning scorn, yet they emanate\r\nfrom a bosom that glows with love for my bewildered countrymen. And my\r\nlast request is, that every patriotic father will gather his little\r\nflock around him at evening shades, and read this parting admonition in\r\na clear and feeling voice, and then kneel before the God of nations,\r\nand implore Him to preserve their liberties, with a blessing on the\r\nhumble author of this production, in his unhappy seclusion in a distant\r\nland. I would write more, but gushing tears blind my vision, and swell\r\nmy heart with dying emotions.\r\n\r\n  Affectionately,\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\nNew York, May 30, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the New York Times, of 1855.]\r\n\r\n Stephen H. Branch on Worms,—The Vermicular Theory of\r\n Greatness.—Subdued Sea-Serpents—Alligators Outdone—Look out for a\r\n Rise in the price of Vermifuges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  To the Editor of the New York Daily Times:\r\n\r\nSome men donate or construct public and private institutions for the\r\npublic applause while living, while others write the sunny side of\r\ntheir lives from motives of fame and accumulation. I shall leave both\r\nsides of my career for the historian after I have departed for the\r\nspirit land.\r\n\r\nSince my return from Europe, with the Brandon Register, with little\r\nGeorgy Matsell recorded therein, (as having been baptised and received\r\ninto the Church in 1811, which corresponds with his own oath before\r\nthe Police Committee, that he was born in 1811—stick a pin here,)—I\r\nhave been violently assailed by journals in the Matsell interest,\r\npublished on the Five Points, who attack me for sins committed while I\r\nhad a superabundance of mischievous worms in youth and early manhood,\r\nand while I was scattering wild oats rather profusely over my father’s\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nNo man lives who would not gladly efface every oat he sowed during\r\nthe fervors and exhilerations of boyhood and early manhood. But\r\nthe deliberate perjury of full-grown manhood can only be effaced\r\nthrough long years of retired and tearful contrition. By unceasing\r\nsupplication, the wilderness may ultimately hide from scorn the cool\r\nand premeditated perjurer; but no man exists who would not blot from\r\nthe living and eternal records whole rows of wild oat hillocks; and\r\nno infant who has not premature teeth, to bite and snarl at their\r\nnurses, and to scream and raise Beelzebub all night—and no boy who\r\ndoes not have a profusion of worms, and a nature literally suffused\r\nwith sharp vinegar and aqua-fortis, with two or three little devils\r\nin his stomach—no infant or boy without these hateful qualities ever\r\nmake much stir in the world. And if, in the morning of life, we do not\r\nreflect Vesuvius in our eyes, and belch lava and brimstone from our\r\nmouths, we seldom effect much in the great scuffle of life, and go down\r\nto our graves with Miss Nancy inscribed at the head and tail of our\r\ngrassy mounds.\r\n\r\nMan, like a horse, must have mettle, and plenty of it, with an immense\r\nbottom, or he cannot expect to contend with the fiery steeds of the\r\nturf and the forum. And, above all, a man must have a crop or two of\r\nworms at 40. All men have more worms in their bellies than they are\r\naware of, (or their physicians, either,) and some have quarts.\r\n\r\nBut they must not keep the old crop too long. Worms must come and go\r\nwith the seasons, or they will produce incarcerated wind, which often\r\nproduces apoplexy and paralysis. Nervous dyspepsia also arises from\r\nan old crop of worms and a pent-up atmosphere. 1 got rid of eleven\r\nworms, ten inches long, about two years since, and I have been losing\r\nmy energy and courage ever since. I caught the rascals thus: While\r\nin a bath-room one day, I saw something very mysterious. I applied a\r\nlighted cigar to its head or tail, (for it was sharp at both ends,) and\r\nI observed a slight movement. I touched it at the other end, and it\r\nmoved in an opposite direction. I then struck a match, which I applied\r\nto its middle, when, lo! it was a worm, and alive and kicking. It\r\ndied in about two minutes by Shrewsbury clock. I began immediately to\r\ntake worm seed, and the following day I discovered five worms, one of\r\nwhich was tied in a perfect knot. The last worm I discovered was very\r\nsmall, which satisfied me that it was the last of his race. I think I\r\nalways had whole generations of worms up to this last little scamp,\r\nand I kept him to transmit to my posterity. For, when coming home from\r\nschool one day, I pulled on a worm until I could pull no longer, and\r\ngot another boy to pull him entirely out. And when I beheld the monster\r\non the ground, I ran home for my life, and before I got home, a thunder\r\nstorm arose and terrified me almost to death.\r\n\r\nWorms, doubtless, are the source of impulse. And impulsive persons have\r\nmore or less worms, and never less than a pint. And very impulsive\r\npersons have not less than a quart. Matsell is nearly as fat as Daniel\r\nLambert, and has about two gallons of colossal worms. And these\r\nmiserable worms conquer us when living and dead. They have been my\r\nmasters all my days. They have produced the dark spots in my history,\r\nover which I have dropped many a tear, and over which I shall weep\r\nuntil I get down into my extremely narrow and tranquil and undying\r\nabode.\r\n\r\nWorms produce the evil in the history of all men, and yet they are\r\nprolific of infinite good. When they violently dart from extremity to\r\nextremity, and come up and look over the tongue, and dart back to the\r\nsweet bowels’ depths, and squirm most horribly for their regular food,\r\na man swells with unconquerable fear, and can face the cannon’s mouth,\r\nand the devil himself, and people call him a courageous patriot,—when\r\nworms achieved every battle that was ever won. Napoleon had a most\r\nungodly quantity of worms, and in their constant pecking at his liver,\r\nthey finally produced a cancer of which he died. Worms did not start\r\nPatrick Henry’s eloquence until he was forty years old. Jackson, too,\r\nhad worms, that made his eye flash like a rifle and his voice drown\r\nthe cannon. Jackson’s worms, in early life, elicited a passion for\r\nhorse-racing and cock-fighting, and caused such expressions as “by the\r\nEternal.” But as soon as the worms left him he lost his nerve, and\r\njoined the Presbyterians. The worms of Julius Cæsar, at the verge of\r\nthe Rubicon, were asleep over a hearty meal, but during his protracted\r\ncontemplation of its passage, they suddenly awoke, and over he went\r\nwith gigantic strides, and established Brandon, in the eastern counties\r\nof England, where little Georgy Matsell was born. Worms incarcerated\r\nLafayette and Louis Napoleon, and worms made Eve tempt Adam, and Cain\r\nkill Abel, and are the source of the rise and fall of empires, and of\r\nall the good and evil that exist. And Shakspeare’s worms got hungry\r\none day, and he went out on a poaching excursion, and thereby lost his\r\nhonor, and had to fly from the dear scenes of his youth. But a fresh\r\ncrop of worms, and their subsequent generations, directed a pen that\r\nwill entwine his memory around and within the body, flesh, blood, bones\r\nand marrow of the solitary being who beholds the orbs of night and day\r\nforever close their brilliant eyes on a numerous, funny, and mysterious\r\nrace of worms that have so long defaced, and polluted and crawled\r\nthrough earth, sea and air, leaving their nauseous slime behind.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,      STEPHEN H.
