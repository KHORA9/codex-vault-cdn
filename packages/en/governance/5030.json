Every step taken is under the observation of an\r\nintelligent and watchful people. The state of the Union is known from day\r\nto day, and suggestions as to needed legislation find an earlier voice than\r\nthat which speaks in these annual communications of the President to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nGood will and cordiality have characterized our relations and\r\ncorrespondence with other governments, and the year just closed leaves few\r\ninternational questions of importance remaining unadjusted. No obstacle is\r\nbelieved to exist that can long postpone the consideration and adjustment\r\nof the still pending questions upon satisfactory and honorable terms. The\r\ndealings of this Government with other states have been and should always\r\nbe marked by frankness and sincerity, our purposes avowed, and our methods\r\nfree from intrigue. This course has borne rich fruit in the past, and it is\r\nour duty as a nation to preserve the heritage of good repute which a\r\ncentury of right dealing with foreign governments has secured to us.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of high significance and no less of congratulation that the\r\nfirst year of the second century of our constitutional existence finds as\r\nhonored guests within our borders the representatives of all the\r\nindependent States of North and South America met together in earnest\r\nconference touching the best methods of perpetuating and expanding the\r\nrelations of mutual interest and friendliness existing among them. That the\r\nopportunity thus afforded for promoting closer international relations and\r\nthe increased prosperity of the States represented will be used for the\r\nmutual good of all I can not permit myself to doubt. Our people will await\r\nwith interest and confidence the results to flow from so auspicious a\r\nmeeting of allied and in large part identical interests.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of this international conference of enlightened\r\nstatesmen will doubtless have the considerate attention of Congress and its\r\ncooperation in the removal of unnecessary barriers to beneficial\r\nintercourse between the nations of America. But while the commercial\r\nresults which it is hoped will follow this conference are worthy of pursuit\r\nand of the great interests they have excited, it is believed that the\r\ncrowning benefit will be found in the better securities which may be\r\ndevised for the maintenance of peace among all American nations and the\r\nsettlement of all contentions by methods that a Christian civilization can\r\napprove. While viewing with interest our national resources and products,\r\nthe delegates will, I am sure, find a higher satisfaction in the evidences\r\nof unselfish friendship which everywhere attend their intercourse with our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAnother international conference having great possibilities for good has\r\nlately assembled and is now in session in this capital. An invitation was\r\nextended by the Government, under the act of Congress of July 9, 1888, to\r\nall maritime nations to send delegates to confer touching the revision and\r\namendment of the rules and regulations governing vessels at sea and to\r\nadopt a uniform system of marine signals. The response to this invitation\r\nhas been very general and very cordial. Delegates from twenty-six nations\r\nare present in the conference, and they have entered upon their useful work\r\nwith great zeal and with an evident appreciation of its importance. So far\r\nas the agreement to be reached may require legislation to give it effect,\r\nthe cooperation of Congress is confidently relied upon.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting, if not, indeed, an unprecedented, fact that the two\r\ninternational conferences have brought together here the accredited\r\nrepresentatives of thirty-three nations.\r\n\r\nBolivia, Ecuador, and Honduras are now represented by resident envoys of\r\nthe plenipotentiary grade. All the States of the American system now\r\nmaintain diplomatic representation at this capital.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be noted that all the nations of the Western\r\nHemisphere, with one exception, send to Washington envoys extraordinary and\r\nministers plenipotentiary, being the highest grade accredited to this\r\nGovernment. The United States, on the contrary, sends envoys of lower\r\ngrades to some of our sister Republics. Our representative in Paraguay and\r\nUruguay is a minister resident, while to Bolivia we send a minister\r\nresident and consul-general. In view of the importance of our relations\r\nwith the States of the American system, our diplomatic agents in those\r\ncountries should be of the uniform rank of envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary. Certain missions were so elevated by the last Congress\r\nwith happy effect, and I recommend the completion of the reform thus begun,\r\nwith the inclusion also of Hawaii and Hayti, in view of their relations to\r\nthe American system of states.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that timely provision be made for extending to Hawaii an\r\ninvitation to be represented in the international conference now sitting at\r\nthis capital.\r\n\r\nOur relations with China have the attentive consideration which their\r\nmagnitude and interest demand. The failure of the treaty negotiated under\r\nthe Administration of my predecessor for the further and more complete\r\nrestriction of Chinese labor immigration, and with it the legislation of\r\nthe last session of Congress dependent thereon, leaves some questions open\r\nwhich Congress should now approach in that wise and just spirit which\r\nshould characterize the relations of two great and friendly powers. While\r\nour supreme interests demand the exclusion of a laboring element which\r\nexperience has shown to be incompatible with our social life, all steps to\r\ncompass this imperative need should be accompanied with a recognition of\r\nthe claim of those strangers now lawfully among us to humane and just\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the young Emperor of China marks, we may hope, an era of\r\nprogress and prosperity for the great country over which he is called to\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe present state of affairs in respect to the Samoan Islands is\r\nencouraging. The conference which was held in this city in the summer of\r\n1887 between the representatives of the United States, Germany, and Great\r\nBritain having been adjourned because of the persistent divergence of views\r\nwhich was developed in its deliberations, the subsequent course of events\r\nin the islands gave rise to questions of a serious character. On the 4th of\r\nFebruary last the German minister at this capital, in behalf of his\r\nGovernment, proposed a resumption of the conference at Berlin. This\r\nproposition was accepted, as Congress in February last was informed.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the understanding thus reached, commissioners were appointed by\r\nme, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, who proceeded to\r\nBerlin, where the conference was renewed. The deliberations extended\r\nthrough several weeks, and resulted in the conclusion of a treaty which\r\nwill be submitted to the Senate for its approval. I trust that the efforts\r\nwhich have been made to effect an adjustment of this question will be\r\nproductive of the permanent establishment of law and order in Samoa upon\r\nthe basis of the maintenance of the rights and interests of the natives as\r\nwell as of the treaty powers.\r\n\r\nThe questions which have arisen during the past few years between Great\r\nBritain and the United States are in abeyance or in course of amicable\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the government of the Dominion of Canada an effort has been\r\napparent during the season just ended to administer the laws and\r\nregulations applicable to the fisheries with as little occasion for\r\nfriction as was possible, and the temperate representations of this\r\nGovernment in respect of cases of undue hardship or of harsh\r\ninterpretations have been in most cases met with measures of transitory\r\nrelief. It is trusted that the attainment of our just rights under existing\r\ntreaties and in virtue of the concurrent legislation of the two contiguous\r\ncountries will not be long deferred and that all existing causes of\r\ndifference may be equitably adjusted.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made by an international agreement for\r\nvisibly marking the water boundary between the United States and Canada in\r\nthe narrow channels that join the Great Lakes. The conventional line\r\ntherein traced by the northwestern boundary survey years ago is not in all\r\ncases readily ascertainable for the settlement of jurisdictional\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nA just and acceptable enlargement of the list of offenses for which\r\nextradition may be claimed and granted is most desirable between this\r\ncountry and Great Britain. The territory of neither should become a secure\r\nharbor for the evil doers of the other through any avoidable shortcoming in\r\nthis regard. A new treaty on this subject between the two powers has been\r\nrecently negotiated and will soon be laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the commerce of Cuba and Puerto Rico with the United\r\nStates, their nearest and principal market, justifies the expectation that\r\nthe existing relations may be beneficially expanded. The impediments\r\nresulting from varying dues on navigation and from the vexatious treatment\r\nof our vessels on merely technical grounds of complaint in West India ports\r\nshould be removed.\r\n\r\nThe progress toward an adjustment of pending claims between the United\r\nStates and Spain is not as rapid as could be desired.\r\n\r\nQuestions affecting American interests in connection with railways\r\nconstructed and operated by our citizens in Peru have claimed the attention\r\nof this Government. It is urged that other governments in pressing Peru to\r\nthe payment of their claims have disregarded the property rights of\r\nAmerican citizens. The matter will be carefully investigated with a view to\r\nsecuring a proper and equitable adjustment.\r\n\r\nA similar issue is now pending with Portugal. The Delagoa Bay Railway, in\r\nAfrica, was constructed under a concession by Portugal to an American\r\ncitizen. When nearly completed the road was seized by the agents of the\r\nPortuguese Government. Formal protest has been made through our minister at\r\nLisbon against this act, and no proper effort will be spared to secure\r\nproper relief.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the charter granted by Congress and under the terms of its\r\ncontract with the Government of Nicaragua the Interoceanic Canal Company\r\nhas begun the construction of the important waterway between the two oceans\r\nwhich its organization contemplates. Grave complications for a time seemed\r\nimminent, in view of a supposed conflict of jurisdiction between Nicaragua\r\nand Costa Rica in regard to the accessory privileges to be conceded by the\r\nlatter Republic toward the construction of works on the San Juan River, of\r\nwhich the right bank is Costa Rican territory. I am happy to learn that a\r\nfriendly arrangement has been effected between the two nations. This\r\nGovernment has held itself ready to promote in every proper way the\r\nadjustment of all questions that might present obstacles to the completion\r\nof a work of such transcendent importance to the commerce of this country,\r\nand, indeed, to the commercial interests of the world.\r\n\r\nThe traditional good feeling between this country and the French Republic\r\nhas received additional testimony in the participation of our Government\r\nand people in the international exposition held at Paris during the past\r\nsummer. The success of our exhibitors has been gratifying. The report of\r\nthe commission will be laid before Congress in due season.\r\n\r\nThis Government has accepted, under proper reserve as to its policy in\r\nforeign territories, the invitation of the Government of Belgium to take\r\npart in an international congress, which opened at Brussels on the 16th of\r\nNovember, for the purpose of devising measures to promote the abolition of\r\nthe slave trade in Africa and to prevent the shipment of slaves by sea. Our\r\ninterest in the extinction of this crime against humanity in the regions\r\nwhere it yet survives has been increased by the results of emancipation\r\nwithin our own borders.\r\n\r\nWith Germany the most cordial relations continue. The questions arising\r\nfrom the return to the Empire of Germans naturalized in this country are\r\nconsidered and disposed of in a temperate spirit to the entire satisfaction\r\nof both Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction that the internal disturbances of the\r\nRepublic of Hayti are at last happily ended, and that an apparently stable\r\ngovernment has been constituted. It has been duly recognized by the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA mixed commission is now in session in this capital for the settlement of\r\nlong-standing claims against the Republic of Venezuela, and it is hoped\r\nthat a satisfactory conclusion will be speedily reached. This Government\r\nhas not hesitated to express its earnest desire that the boundary dispute\r\nnow pending between Great Britain and Venezuela may be adjusted amicably\r\nand in strict accordance with the historic title of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the Empire of Japan has been evidenced by the recent\r\npromulgation of a new constitution, containing valuable guaranties of\r\nliberty and providing for a responsible ministry to conduct the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly recommended that our judicial rights and processes in Korea\r\nbe established on a firm basis by providing the machinery necessary to\r\ncarry out treaty stipulations in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe friendliness of the Persian Government continues to be shown by its\r\ngenerous treatment of Americans engaged in missionary labors and by the\r\ncordial disposition of the Shah to encourage the enterprise of our citizens\r\nin the development of Persian resources.\r\n\r\nA discussion is in progress touching the jurisdictional treaty rights of\r\nthe United States in Turkey. An earnest effort will be made to define those\r\nrights to the satisfaction of both Governments.\r\n\r\nQuestions continue to arise in our relations with several countries in\r\nrespect to the rights of naturalized citizens. Especially is this the case\r\nwith France, Italy, Russia, and Turkey, and to a less extent with\r\nSwitzerland. From time to time earnest efforts have been made to regulate\r\nthis subject by conventions with those countries. An improper use of\r\nnaturalization should not be permitted, but it is most important that those\r\nwho have been duly naturalized should everywhere be accorded recognition of\r\nthe rights pertaining to the citizenship of the country of their adoption.\r\nThe appropriateness of special conventions for that purpose is recognized\r\nin treaties which this Government has concluded with a number of European\r\nStates, and it is advisable that the difficulties which now arise in our\r\nrelations with other countries on the same subject should be similarly\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nThe recent revolution in Brazil in favor of the establishment of a\r\nrepublican form of government is an event of great interest to the United\r\nStates. Our minister at Rio de Janeiro was at once instructed to maintain\r\nfriendly diplomatic relations with the Provisional Government, and the\r\nBrazilian representatives at this capital were instructed by the\r\nProvisional Government to continue their functions. Our friendly\r\nintercourse with Brazil has therefore suffered no interruption.\r\n\r\nOur minister has been further instructed to extend on the part of this\r\nGovernment a formal and cordial recognition of the new Republic so soon as\r\nthe majority of the people of Brazil shall have signified their assent to\r\nits establishment and maintenance.\r\n\r\nWithin our own borders a general condition of prosperity prevails. The\r\nharvests of the last summer were exceptionally abundant, and the trade\r\nconditions now prevailing seem to promise a successful season to the\r\nmerchant and the manufacturer and general employment to our working\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury for the fiscal year ending June\r\n30, 1889, has been prepared and will be presented to Congress. It presents\r\nwith clearness the fiscal operations of the Government, and I avail myself\r\nof it to obtain some facts for use here.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate receipts from all sources for the year were $387,050,058.84,\r\nderived as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom customs - $223, 832, 741.69\r\n\r\nFrom internal revenue - 130,881,513.92\r\n\r\nFrom miscellaneous sources - 32,335,803.23\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures for the same period were $281,996,615.60, and the\r\ntotal expenditures, including the sinking fund, were $329,579,929.25. The\r\nexcess of receipts over expenditures was, after providing for the sinking\r\nfund, $57,470,129.59.\r\n\r\nFor the current fiscal year the total revenues, actual and estimated are\r\n$385,000,000, and the ordinary expenditures, actual and estimated, are\r\n$293,000,000, making with the sinking fund a total expenditure of\r\n$341,321,116.99, leaving an estimated surplus of $43,678,883.01.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year there was applied to the purchase of bonds, in\r\naddition to those for the sinking fund, $90,456,172.35, and during the\r\nfirst quarter of the current year the sum of $37,838,937.77, all of which\r\nwere credited to the sinking fund. The revenues for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1891, are estimated by the Treasury Department at $385,000,000,\r\nand the expenditures for the same period, including the sinking fund, at\r\n$341,430,477.70. This shows an estimated surplus for that year of\r\n$43,569,522.30, which is more likely to be increased than reduced when the\r\nactual transactions are written up.\r\n\r\nThe existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should have the\r\nimmediate attention of Congress, with a view to reducing the receipts of\r\nthe Treasury to the needs of the Government as closely as may be. The\r\ncollection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary\r\nburden upon our people, and the presence of so large a surplus in the\r\npublic vaults is a disturbing element in the conduct of private business.\r\nIt has called into use expedients for putting it into circulation of very\r\nquestionable propriety. We should not collect revenue for the purpose of\r\nanticipating our bonds beyond the requirements of the sinking fund, but any\r\nunappropriated surplus in the Treasury should be so used, as there is no\r\nother lawful way of returning the money to circulation, and the profit\r\nrealized by the Government offers a substantial advantage.\r\n\r\nThe loaning of public funds to the banks without interest Upon the security\r\nof Government bonds I regard as an unauthorized and dangerous expedient. It\r\nresults in a temporary and unnatural increase of the banking capital of\r\nfavored localities and compels a cautious and gradual recall of the\r\ndeposits to avoid injury to the commercial interests. It is not to be\r\nexpected that the banks having these deposits will sell their bonds to the\r\nTreasury so long as the present highly beneficial arrangement is continued.\r\nThey now practically get interest both upon the bonds and their proceeds.\r\nNo further use should be made of this method of getting the surplus into\r\ncirculation, and the deposits now outstanding should be gradually withdrawn\r\nand applied to the purchase of bonds. It is fortunate that such a use can\r\nbe made of the existing surplus, and for some time to come of any casual\r\nsurplus that may exist after Congress has taken the necessary steps for a\r\nreduction of the revenue. Such legislation should be promptly but very\r\nconsiderately enacted.\r\n\r\nI recommend a revision of our tariff law both in its administrative\r\nfeatures and in the schedules. The need of the former is generally\r\nconceded, and an agreement upon the evils and inconveniences to be remedied\r\nand the best methods for their correction will probably not be difficult.\r\nUniformity of valuation at all our ports is essential, and effective\r\nmeasures should be taken to secure it. It is equally desirable that\r\nquestions affecting rates and classifications should be promptly decided.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a new schedule of customs duties is a matter of great\r\ndelicacy because of its direct effect upon the business of the country, and\r\nof great difficulty by reason of the wide divergence of opinion as to the\r\nobjects that may properly be promoted by such legislation. Some disturbance\r\nof business may perhaps result from the consideration of this subject by\r\nCongress, but this temporary ill effect will be reduced to the minimum by\r\nprompt action and by the assurance which the country already enjoys that\r\nany necessary changes will be so made as not to impair the just and\r\nreasonable protection of our home industries. The inequalities of the law\r\nshould be adjusted, but the protective principle should be maintained and\r\nfairly applied to the products of our farms as well as of our shops. These\r\nduties necessarily have relation to other things besides the public\r\nrevenues. We can not limit their effects by fixing our eyes on the public\r\nTreasury alone. They have a direct relation to home production, to work, to\r\nwages, and to the commercial independence of our country, and the wise and\r\npatriotic legislator should enlarge the field of his vision to include all\r\nof these. The necessary reduction in our public revenues can, I am sure, be\r\nmade without making the smaller burden more onerous than the larger by\r\nreason of the disabilities and limitations which the process of reduction\r\nputs upon both capital and labor. The free list can very safely be extended\r\nby placing thereon articles that do not offer injurious competition to such\r\ndomestic products as our home labor can supply. The removal of the internal\r\ntax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural product from a\r\nburden which was imposed only because our revenue from customs duties was\r\ninsufficient for the public needs. If safe provision against fraud can be\r\ndevised, the removal of the tax upon spirits used in the arts and in\r\nmanufactures would also offer an unobjectionable method of reducing the\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\nA table presented by the Secretary of the Treasury showing the amount of\r\nmoney of all kinds in circulation each year from 1878 to the present time\r\nis of interest. It appears that the amount of national-bank notes in\r\ncirculation has decreased during that period $114,109,729, of which\r\n$37,799,229 is chargeable to the last year. The withdrawal of bank\r\ncirculation will necessarily continue under existing conditions. It is\r\nprobable that the adoption of the suggestions made by the Comptroller of\r\nthe Currency, namely, that the minimum deposit of bonds for the\r\nestablishment of banks be reduced and that an issue of notes to the par\r\nvalue of the bonds be allowed, would help to maintain the bank circulation.\r\nBut while this withdrawal of bank notes has been going on there has been a\r\nlarge increase in the amount of gold and silver coin in circulation and in\r\nthe issues of gold and silver certificates.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of money of all kinds in circulation on March 1, 1878, was\r\n$805,793,807, while on October 1, 1889, the total was $1,405,018,000. There\r\nwas an increase of $293,417,552 in gold coin, of $57,554,100 in standard\r\nsilver dollars, of $72,311,249 in gold certificates, of $276,619,715 in\r\nsilver certificates, and of $14,073,787 in United States notes, making a\r\ntotal of $713,976,403. There was during the same period a decrease of\r\n$114,109,729 in bank circulation and of $642,481 in subsidiary silver. The\r\nnet increase was $599,224,193. The circulation per capita has increased\r\nabout $5 during the time covered by the table referred to.\r\n\r\nThe total coinage of silver dollars was on November 1, 1889, $343,638,001,\r\nof which $283,539,521 were in the Treasury vaults and $60,098,480 were in\r\ncirculation. Of the amount in the vaults $277,319,944 were represented by\r\noutstanding silver certificates, leaving $6,219,577 not in circulation and\r\nnot represented by certificates.\r\n\r\nThe law requiring the purchase by the Treasury of $2,000,000 worth of\r\nsilver bullion each month, to be coined into silver dollars of 412 1/2\r\ngrains, has been observed by the Department, but neither the present\r\nSecretary nor any of his predecessors has deemed it safe to exercise the\r\ndiscretion given by law to increase the monthly purchases to $4,000,000.\r\nWhen the law was enacted (February 28, 1878) the price of silver in the\r\nmarket was $1.204 per ounce, making the bullion value of the dollar 93\r\ncents. Since that time the price has fallen as low as 91.2 cents per ounce,\r\nreducing the bullion value of the dollar to 70.6 cents. Within the last few\r\nmonths the market price has somewhat advanced, and on the 1st day of\r\nNovember last the bullion value of the silver dollar was 72 cents.\r\n\r\nThe evil anticipations which have accompanied the coinage and use of the\r\nsilver dollar have not been realized. As a coin it has not had general use,\r\nand the public Treasury has been compelled to store it. But this is\r\nmanifestly owing to the fact that its paper representative is more\r\nconvenient. The general acceptance and the use of the silver certificate\r\nshow that silver has not been otherwise discredited. Some favorable\r\nconditions have contributed to maintain this practical equality in their\r\ncommercial use between the gold and silver dollars; but some of these are\r\ntrade conditions that statutory enactments do not control and of the\r\ncontinuance of which we can not be certain.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear that if we should make the coinage of silver at the\r\npresent ratio free we must expect that the difference in the bullion values\r\nof the gold and silver dollars will be taken account of in commercial\r\ntransactions; and I fear the same result would follow any considerable\r\nincrease of the present rate of coinage. Such a result would be\r\ndiscreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all business\r\ninterests. We should not tread the dangerous edge of such a peril. And,\r\nindeed, nothing more harmful could happen to the silver interests. Any safe\r\nlegislation upon this subject must secure the equality of the two coins in\r\ntheir commercial uses.\r\n\r\nI have always been an advocate of the use of silver in our currency. We are\r\nlarge producers of that metal, and should not discredit it. To the plan\r\nwhich will be presented by the Secretary of the Treasury for the issuance\r\nof notes or certificates upon the deposit of silver bullion at its market\r\nvalue I have been able to give only a hasty examination, owing to the press\r\nof other matters and to the fact that it has been so recently formulated.\r\nThe details of such a law require careful consideration, but the general\r\nplan suggested by him seems to satisfy the purpose--to continue the use of\r\nsilver in connection with our currency and at the same time to obviate the\r\ndanger of which I have spoken. At a later day I may communicate further\r\nwith Congress upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the Chinese exclusion act has been found to be very\r\ndifficult on the northwestern frontier. Chinamen landing at Victoria find\r\nit easy to pass our border, owing to the impossibility with the force at\r\nthe command of the customs officers of guarding so long an inland line. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury has authorized the employment of additional\r\nofficers, who will be assigned to this duty, and every effort will be made\r\nto enforce the law. The Dominion exacts a head tax of $50 for each Chinaman\r\nlanded, and when these persons, in fraud of our law, cross into our\r\nterritory and are apprehended our officers do not know what to do with\r\nthem, as the Dominion authorities will not suffer them to be sent back\r\nwithout a second payment of the tax. An effort will be made to reach an\r\nunderstanding that will remove this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation required by section 3 of the act of March 2, 1889,\r\nrelating to the killing of seals and other fur-bearing animals, was issued\r\nby me on the 21st day of March, and a revenue vessel was dispatched to\r\nenforce the laws and protect the interests of the United States. The\r\nestablishment of a refuge station at Point Barrow, as directed by Congress,\r\nwas successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nJudged by modern standards, we are practically without coast defenses. Many\r\nof the structures we have would enhance rather than diminish the perils of\r\ntheir garrisons if subjected to the fire of improved guns, and very few are\r\nso located as to give full effect to the greater range of such guns as we\r\nare now making for coast-defense uses. This general subject has had\r\nconsideration in Congress for some years, and the appropriation for the\r\nconstruction of large rifled guns made one year ago was, I am sure, the\r\nexpression of a purpose to provide suitable works in which these guns might\r\nbe mounted. An appropriation now made for that purpose would not advance\r\nthe completion of the works beyond our ability to supply them with fairly\r\neffective guns.\r\n\r\nThe security of our coast cities against foreign attacks should not rest\r\naltogether in the friendly disposition of other nations. There should be a\r\nsecond line wholly in our own keeping. I very urgently recommend an\r\nappropriation at this session for the construction of such works in our\r\nmost exposed harbors.\r\n\r\nI approve the suggestion of the Secretary of War that provision be made for\r\nencamping companies of the National Guard in our coast works for a\r\nspecified time each year and for their training in the use of heavy guns.\r\nHis suggestion that an increase of the artillery force of the Army is\r\ndesirable is also, in this connection, commended to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of our important rivers and harbors should be promoted by\r\nthe necessary appropriations. Care should be taken that the Government is\r\nnot committed to the prosecution of works not of public and general\r\nadvantage and that the relative usefulness of works of that class is not\r\noverlooked. So far as this work can ever be said to be completed, I do not\r\ndoubt that the end would be sooner and more economically reached if fewer\r\nseparate works were undertaken at the same time, and those selected for\r\ntheir greater general interest were more rapidly pushed to completion. A\r\nwork once considerably begun should not be subjected to the risks and\r\ndeterioration which interrupted or insufficient appropriations necessarily\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe assault made by David S. Terry upon the person of Justice Field, of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, at Lathtop, Cal., in August last, and\r\nthe killing of the assailant by a deputy United States marshal who had been\r\ndeputed to accompany Justice Field and to protect him from anticipated\r\nviolence at the hands of Terry, in connection with the legal proceedings\r\nwhich have followed, suggest questions which, in my judgment, are worthy of\r\nthe attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nI recommend that more definite provision be made by law not only for the\r\nprotection of Federal officers, but for a full trial of such cases in the\r\nUnited States courts. In recommending such legislation I do not at all\r\nimpeach either the general adequacy of the provision made by the State laws\r\nfor the protection of all citizens or the general good disposition of those\r\ncharged with the execution of such laws to give protection to the officers\r\nof the United States. The duty of protecting its officers, as such, and of\r\npunishing those who assault them on account of their official acts should\r\nnot be devolved expressly or by acquiescence upon the local authorities.\r\n\r\nEvents which have been brought to my attention happening in other parts of\r\nthe country have also suggested the propriety of extending by legislation\r\nfuller protection to those who may be called as witnesses in the courts of\r\nthe United States. The law compels those who are supposed to have knowledge\r\nof public offenses to attend upon our courts and grand juries and to give\r\nevidence. There is a manifest resulting duty that these witnesses shall be\r\nprotected from injury on account of their testimony. The investigations of\r\ncriminal offenses are often rendered futile and the punishment of crime\r\nimpossible by the intimidation of witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of providing some more speedy method for disposing of the\r\ncases which now come for final adjudication to the Supreme Court becomes\r\nevery year more apparent and urgent. The plan of providing some\r\nintermediate courts having final appellate jurisdiction of certain classes\r\nof questions and cases has, I think, received a more general approval from\r\nthe bench and bar of the country than any other. Without attempting to\r\ndiscuss details, I recommend that provision be made for the establishment\r\nof such courts.\r\n\r\nThe salaries of the judges of the district courts in many of the districts\r\nare, in my judgment, inadequate. I recommend that all such salaries now\r\nbelow $5,000 per annum be increased to that amount. It is quite true that\r\nthe amount of labor performed by these judges is very unequal, but as they\r\ncan not properly engage in other pursuits to supplement their incomes the\r\nsalary should be such in all cases as to provide an independent and\r\ncomfortable support.\r\n\r\nEarnest attention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the\r\nquestion how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly\r\ncalled \"trusts\" is matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they\r\noften are, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the\r\nproduction or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity, they\r\nare dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be made the\r\nsubject of prohibitory and even penal legislation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of an international copyright has been frequently commended to\r\nthe attention of Congress by my predecessors. The enactment of such a law\r\nwould be eminently wise and just.\r\n\r\nOur naturalization laws should be so revised as to make the inquiry into\r\nthe moral character and good disposition toward our Government of the\r\npersons applying for citizenship more thorough. This can only be done by\r\ntaking fuller control of the examination, by fixing the times for hearing\r\nsuch applications, and by requiring the presence of some one who shall\r\nrepresent the Government in the inquiry. Those who are the avowed enemies\r\nof social order or who come to our shores to swell the injurious influence\r\nand to extend the evil practices of any association that defies our laws\r\nshould not only be denied citizenship, but a domicile.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of a national bankrupt law of a character to be a permanent\r\npart of our general legislation is desirable. It should be simple in its\r\nmethods and inexpensive in its administration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General not only exhibits the operations of\r\nthe Department for the last fiscal year, but contains many valuable\r\nsuggestions for the improvement and extension of the service, which are\r\ncommended to your attention. No other branch of the Government has so close\r\na contact with the daily life of the people. Almost everyone uses the\r\nservice it offers, and every hour gained in the transmission of the great\r\ncommercial mails has an actual and possible value that only those engaged\r\nin trade can understand.\r\n\r\nThe saving of one day in the transmission of the mails between New York and\r\nSan Francisco, which has recently been accomplished, is an incident worthy\r\nof mention.\r\n\r\nThe plan suggested of a supervision of the post-offices in separate\r\ndistricts that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating of the\r\nefficiency of the postmasters would, I have no doubt, greatly improve the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nA pressing necessity exists for the erection of a building for the joint\r\nuse of the Department and of the city post-office. The Department was\r\npartially relieved by renting .outside quarters for a part of its force,\r\nbut it is again overcrowded. The building used by the city office never was\r\nfit for the purpose, and is now inadequate and unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory condition of the law relating to the transmission\r\nthrough the mails of lottery advertisements and remittances is clearly\r\nstated by the Postmaster-General, and his suggestion as to amendments\r\nshould have your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a reorganization of the\r\nbureaus of the Department that will, I do not doubt, promote the efficiency\r\nof each.\r\n\r\nIn general, satisfactory progress has been made in the construction of the\r\nnew ships of war authorized by Congress. The first vessel of the new Navy,\r\nthe Dolphin, was subjected to very severe trial tests and to very much\r\nadverse criticism; but it is gratifying to be able to state that a cruise\r\naround the world, from which she has recently returned, has demonstrated\r\nthat she is a first-class vessel of her rate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary shows that while the effective force of the\r\nNavy is rapidly increasing by reason of the improved build and armament of\r\nthe new ships, the number of our ships fit for sea duty grows very slowly.\r\nWe had on the 4th of March last 37 serviceable ships, and though 4 have\r\nsince been added to the list, the total has not been increased, because in\r\nthe meantime 4 have been lost or condemned. Twenty-six additional vessels\r\nhave been authorized and appropriated for; but it is probable that when\r\nthey are completed our list will only be increased to 42--a gain of 5. The\r\nold wooden ships are disappearing almost as fast as the new vessels are\r\nadded. These facts carry their own argument. One of the new ships may in\r\nfighting strength be equal to two of the old, but it can not do the\r\ncruising duty of two. It is important, therefore, that we should have a\r\nmore rapid increase in the number of serviceable ships. I concur in the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary that the construction of 8 armored ships, 3\r\ngunboats, and 5 torpedo boats be authorized.\r\n\r\nAn appalling calamity befell three of our naval vessels on duty at the\r\nSamoan Islands, in the harbor of Apia, in March last, involving the loss of\r\n4 officers and 47 seamen, of two vessels, the Trenton and the Vandalia, and\r\nthe disabling of a third, the Nipsic. Three vessels of the German navy,\r\nalso in the harbor, shared with our ships the force of the hurricane and\r\nsuffered even more heavily. While mourning the brave officers and men who\r\ndied facing with high resolve perils greater than those of battle, it is\r\nmost gratifying to state that the credit of the American Navy for\r\nseamanship, courage, and generosity was magnificently sustained in the\r\nstorm-beaten harbor of Apia.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the transactions of\r\nthe Government with the Indian tribes. Substantial progress has been made\r\nin the education of the children of school age and in the allotment of\r\nlands to adult Indians. It is to be regretted that the policy of breaking\r\nup the tribal relation and of dealing with the Indian as an individual did\r\nnot appear earlier in our legislation. Large reservations held in common\r\nand the maintenance of the authority of the chiefs and headmen have\r\ndeprived the individual of every incentive to the exercise of thrift, and\r\nthe annuity has contributed an affirmative impulse toward a state of\r\nconfirmed pauperism.\r\n\r\nOur treaty stipulations should be observed with fidelity and our\r\nlegislation should be highly considerate of the best interests of an\r\nignorant and helpless people. The reservations are now generally surrounded\r\nby white settlements. We can no longer push the Indian back into the\r\nwilderness, and it remains only by every suitable agency to push him upward\r\ninto the estate of a self-supporting and responsible citizen. For the adult\r\nthe first step is to locate him upon a farm, and for the child to place him\r\nin a school.\r\n\r\nSchool attendance should be promoted by every moral agency, and those\r\nfailing should be compelled. The national schools for Indians have been\r\nvery successful and should be multiplied, and as far as possible should be\r\nso organized and conducted as to facilitate the transfer of the schools to\r\nthe States or Territories in which they are located when the Indians in a\r\nneighborhood have accepted citizenship and have become otherwise fitted for\r\nsuch a transfer. This condition of things will be attained slowly, but it\r\nwill be hastened by keeping it in mind; and in the meantime that\r\ncooperation between the Government and the mission schools which has\r\nwrought much good should be cordially and impartially maintained.\r\n\r\nThe last Congress enacted two distinct laws relating to negotiations with\r\nthe Sioux Indians of Dakota for a relinquishment of a portion of their\r\nlands to the United States and for dividing the remainder into separate\r\nreservations. Both were approved on the same day--March 2. The one\r\nsubmitted to the Indians a specific proposition; the other (section 3 of\r\nthe Indian appropriation act) authorized the President to appoint three\r\ncommissioners to negotiate with these Indians for the accomplishment of the\r\nsame general purpose, and required that any agreements made should be\r\nsubmitted to Congress for ratification.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of April last I appointed Hon. Charles Foster, of Ohio,\r\nHon. William Warner, of Missouri, and Major-General George Crook, of the\r\nUnited States Army, commissioners under the last-named law. They were,\r\nhowever, authorized and directed first to submit to the Indians the\r\ndefinite proposition made to them by the act first mentioned, and only in\r\nthe event of a failure to secure the assent of the requisite number to that\r\nproposition to open negotiations for modified terms under the other act.\r\nThe work of the commission was prolonged and arduous, but the assent of the\r\nrequisite number was, it is understood, finally obtained to the proposition\r\nmade by Congress, though the report of the commission has not yet been\r\nsubmitted. In view of these facts, I shall not, as at present advised, deem\r\nit necessary to submit the agreement to Congress for ratification, but it\r\nwill in due course be submitted for information. This agreement releases to\r\nthe United States about 9,000,000 acres of land.\r\n\r\nThe commission provided for by section 14 of the Indian appropriation bill\r\nto negotiate with the Cherokee Indians and all other Indians owning or\r\nclaiming lands lying west of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude for the\r\ncession to the United States of all such lands was constituted by the\r\nappointment of Hon. Lucius Fairchild, of Wisconsin, Hon. John F. Hartranft,\r\nof Pennsylvania, and Hon. Alfred M. Wilson, of Arkansas, and organized on\r\nJune 29 last. Their first conference with the representatives of the\r\nCherokees was held at Tahlequah July 29, with no definite results. General\r\nJohn F. Hartranft, of Pennsylvania, was prevented by ill health from taking\r\npart in the conference. His death, which occurred recently, is justly and\r\ngenerally lamented by a people he had served with conspicuous gallantry in\r\nwar and with great fidelity in peace. The vacancy thus created was filled\r\nby the appointment of Hon. Warren G. Sayre, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nA second conference between the commission and the Cherokees was begun\r\nNovember 6, but no results have yet been obtained, nor is it believed that\r\na conclusion can be immediately expected. The cattle syndicate now\r\noccupying the lands for grazing purposes is clearly one of the agencies\r\nresponsible for the obstruction of our negotiations with the Cherokees. The\r\nlarge body of agricultural lands constituting what is known as the\r\n\"Cherokee Outlet\" ought not to be, and, indeed, can not long be, held for\r\ngrazing and for the advantage of a few against the public interests and the\r\nbest advantage of the Indians themselves. The United States has now under\r\nthe treaties certain rights in these lands. These will not be used\r\noppressively, but it can not be allowed that those who by sufferance occupy\r\nthese lands shall interpose to defeat the wise and beneficent purposes of\r\nthe Government. I can not but believe that the advantageous character of\r\nthe offer made by the United States to the Cherokee Nation for a full\r\nrelease of these lands as compared with other suggestions now made to them\r\nwill yet obtain for it a favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nUnder the agreement made between the United States and the Muscogee (or\r\nCreek) Nation of Indians on the 19th day of January, 1889, an absolute\r\ntitle was secured by the United States to about 3,500,000 acres of land.\r\nSection 12 of the general Indian appropriation act approved March 2, 1889,\r\nmade provision for the purchase by the United States from the Seminole\r\ntribe of a certain portion of their lands. The delegates of the Seminole\r\nNation, having first duly evidenced to me their power to act in that\r\nbehalf, delivered a proper release or conveyance to the United States of\r\nall the lands mentioned in the act, which was accepted by me and certified\r\nto be in compliance with the statute.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of both the acts referred to all the lands so purchased were\r\ndeclared to be a part of the public domain and open to settlement under the\r\nhomestead law. But of the lands embraced in these purchases, being in the\r\naggregate about 5,500,000 acres, 3,500,000 acres had already, under the\r\nterms of the treaty of 1866, been acquired by the United States for the\r\npurpose of settling other Indian tribes thereon and had been appropriated\r\nto that purpose. The land remaining and available for settlement consisted\r\nof 1,887,796 acres, surrounded on all sides by lands in the occupancy of\r\nIndian tribes. Congress had provided no civil government for the people who\r\nwere to be invited by my proclamation to settle upon these lands, except as\r\nthe new court which had been established at Muscogee or the United States\r\ncourts in some of the adjoining States had power to enforce the general\r\nlaws of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of things I was quite reluctant to open the lands to\r\nsettlement; but in view of the fact that several thousand persons, many of\r\nthem with their families, had gathered upon the borders of the Indian\r\nTerritory with a view to securing homesteads on the ceded lands, and that\r\ndelay would involve them in much loss and suffering, I did on the 23d day\r\nof March last issue a proclamation declaring that the lands therein\r\ndescribed would be open to settlement under the provisions of the law on\r\nthe 22d day of April following at 12 o'clock noon. Two land districts had\r\nbeen established and the offices were opened for the transaction of\r\nbusiness when the appointed time arrived.\r\n\r\nIt is much to the credit of the settlers that they very generally observed\r\nthe limitation as to the time when they might enter the Territory. Care\r\nwill be taken that those who entered in violation of the law do not secure\r\nthe advantage they unfairly sought. There was a good deal of apprehension\r\nthat the strife for locations would result in much violence and bloodshed,\r\nbut happily these anticipations were not realized. It is estimated that\r\nthere are now in the Territory about 60,000 people, and several\r\nconsiderable towns have sprung up, for which temporary municipal\r\ngovernments have been organized. Guthrie is said to have now a population\r\nof almost 8,000. Eleven schools and nine churches have been established,\r\nand three daily and five weekly newspapers are published in this city,\r\nwhose charter and ordinances have only the sanction of the voluntary\r\nacquiescence of the people from day to day.\r\n\r\nOklahoma City has a population of about 5,000, and is proportionately as\r\nwell provided as Guthrie with churches, schools, and newspapers. Other\r\ntowns and villages having populations of from 100 to 1,000 are scattered\r\nover the Territory.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the peace of this new community in the absence of civil\r\ngovernment, I directed General Merritt, commanding the Department of the\r\nMissouri, to act in conjunction with the marshals of the United States to\r\npreserve the peace, and upon their requisition to use the troops to aid\r\nthem in executing warrants and in quieting any riots or breaches of the\r\npeace that might occur. He was further directed to use his influence to\r\npromote good order and to avoid any conflicts between or with the settlers.\r\nBelieving that the introduction and sale of liquors where no legal\r\nrestraints or regulations existed would endanger the public peace, and in\r\nview of the fact that such liquors must first be introduced into the Indian\r\nreservations before reaching the white settlements, I further directed the\r\ngeneral commanding to enforce the laws relating to the introduction of\r\nardent spirits into the Indian country.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the troops has given a sense of security to the\r\nwell-disposed citizens and has tended to restrain the lawless. In one\r\ninstance the officer in immediate command of the troops went further than I\r\ndeemed justifiable in supporting the de facto municipal government of\r\nGuthrie, and he was so informed, and directed to limit the interference of\r\nthe military to the support of the marshals on the lines indicated in the\r\noriginal order. I very urgently recommend that Congress at once provide a\r\nTerritorial government for these people. Serious questions, which may at\r\nany time lead to violent outbreaks, are awaiting the institution of courts\r\nfor their peaceful adjustment. The American genius for self-government has\r\nbeen well illustrated in Oklahoma; but it is neither safe nor wise to leave\r\nthese people longer to the expedients which have temporarily served them.\r\n\r\nProvision should be made for the acquisition of title to town lots in the\r\ntowns now established in Alaska, for locating town sites, and for the\r\nestablishment of municipal governments. Only the mining laws have been\r\nextended to that Territory, and no other form of title to lands can now be\r\nobtained. The general land laws were framed with reference to the\r\ndisposition of agricultural lands, and it is doubtful if their operation in\r\nAlaska would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe have fortunately not extended to Alaska the mistaken policy of\r\nestablishing reservations for the Indian tribes, and can deal with them\r\nfrom the beginning as individuals with, I am sure, better results; but any\r\ndisposition of the public lands and any regulations relating to timber and\r\nto the fisheries should have a kindly regard to their interests. Having no\r\npower to levy taxes, the people of Alaska are wholly dependent upon the\r\nGeneral Government, to whose revenues the seal fisheries make a large\r\nannual contribution. An appropriation for education should neither be\r\noverlooked nor stinted.\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the population and the great distances between the\r\nsettlements offer serious obstacles to the establishment of the usual\r\nTerritorial form of government. Perhaps the organization of several\r\nsub-districts with a small municipal council of limited powers for each\r\nwould be safe and useful.\r\n\r\nAttention is called in this connection to the suggestions of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury relating to the establishment of another port of entry in\r\nAlaska and of other needed customs facilities and regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the land laws the policy of facilitating in every\r\nproper way the adjustment of the honest claims of individual settlers upon\r\nthe public lands has been pursued. The number of pending cases had during\r\nthe preceding Administration been greatly increased under the operation of\r\norders for a time suspending final action in a large part of the cases\r\noriginating in the West and Northwest, and by the subsequent use of unusual\r\nmethods of examination. Only those who are familiar with the conditions\r\nunder which our agricultural lands have been settled can appreciate the\r\nserious and often fatal consequences to the settler of a policy that puts\r\nhis title under suspicion or delays the issuance of his patent. While care\r\nis taken to prevent and to expose fraud, it should not be imputed without\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe manifest purpose of the homestead and preemption laws was to promote\r\nthe settlement of the public domain by persons having a bona fide intent to\r\nmake a home upon the selected lands. Where this intent is well established\r\nand the requirements of the law have been substantially complied with, the\r\nclaimant is entitled to a prompt and friendly consideration of his case;\r\nbut where there is reason to believe that the claimant is the mere agent of\r\nanother who is seeking to evade a law intended to promote small holdings\r\nand to secure by fraudulent methods large tracts of timber and other lands,\r\nboth principal and agent should not only be thwarted in their fraudulent\r\npurpose, but should be made to feel the full penalties of our criminal\r\nstatutes. The laws should be so administered as not to confound these two\r\nclasses and to visit penalties only upon the latter.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled state of the titles to large bodies of lands in the\r\nTerritories of New Mexico and Arizona has greatly retarded the development\r\nof those Territories. Provision should be made by law for the prompt trial\r\nand final adjustment before a judicial tribunal or commission of all claims\r\nbased upon Mexican grants. It is not just to an intelligent and\r\nenterprising people that their peace should be disturbed and their\r\nprosperity retarded by these old contentions. I express the hope that\r\ndifferences of opinion as to methods may yield to the urgency of the case.\r\n\r\nThe law now provides a pension for every soldier and sailor who was\r\nmustered into the service of the United States during the Civil War and is\r\nnow suffering from wounds or disease having an origin in the service and in\r\nthe line of duty. Two of the three necessary facts, viz, muster and\r\ndisability, are usually susceptible of easy proof; but the third, origin in\r\nthe service, is often difficult and in many deserving cases impossible to\r\nestablish. That very many of those who endured the hardships of our most\r\nbloody and arduous campaigns are now disabled from diseases that had a real\r\nbut not traceable origin in the service I do not doubt. Besides these there\r\nis another class composed of men many of whom served an enlistment of three\r\nfull years and of reenlisted veterans who added a fourth year of service,\r\nwho escaped the casualties of battle and the assaults of disease, who were\r\nalways ready for any detail, who were in every battle line of their\r\ncommand, and were mustered out in sound health, and have since the close of\r\nthe war, while fighting with the same indomitable and independent spirit\r\nthe contests of civil life, been overcome by disease or casualty.\r\n\r\nI am not unaware that the pension roll already involves a very large annual\r\nexpenditure; neither am I deterred by that fact from recommending that\r\nCongress grant a pension to such honorably discharged soldiers and sailors\r\nof the Civil War as, having rendered substantial service during the war,\r\nare now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance and by disease or\r\ncasualty are incapacitated from earning it. Many of the men who would be\r\nincluded in this form of relief are now dependent upon public aid, and it\r\ndoes not, in my judgment, consist with the national honor that they shall\r\ncontinue to subsist upon the local relief given indiscriminately to paupers\r\ninstead of upon the special and generous provision of the nation they\r\nserved so gallantly and unselfishly. Our people will, I am sure, very\r\ngenerally approve such legislation. And I am equally sure that the\r\nsurvivors of the Union Army and Navy will feel a grateful sense of relief\r\nwhen this worthy and suffering class of their comrades is fairly cared\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThere are some manifest inequalities in the existing law that should be\r\nremedied. To some of these the Secretary of the Interior has called\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to state that by the adoption of new and better\r\nmethods in the War Department the calls of the Pension Office for\r\ninformation as to the military and hospital records of pension claimants\r\nare now promptly answered and the injurious and vexatious delays that have\r\nheretofore occurred are entirely avoided. This will greatly facilitate the\r\nadjustment of all pending claims.\r\n\r\nThe advent of four new States--South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, and\r\nWashington--into the Union under the Constitution in the same month, and\r\nthe admission of their duly chosen representatives to our National Congress\r\nat the same session, is an event as unexampled as it is interesting.\r\n\r\nThe certification of the votes cast and of the constitutions adopted in\r\neach of the States was filed with me, as required by the eighth section of\r\nthe act of February 22, 1889, by the governors of said Territories,\r\nrespectively. Having after a careful examination found that the several\r\nconstitutions and governments were republican in form and not repugnant to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, that all the provisions of the act\r\nof Congress had been complied with, and that a majority of the votes cast\r\nin each of said proposed States was in favor of the adoption of the\r\nconstitution submitted therein, I did so declare by a separate proclamation\r\nas to each--as to North Dakota and South Dakota on Saturday, November 2; as\r\nto Montana on Friday, November 8, and as to Washington on Monday, November\r\n11.\r\n\r\nEach of these States has within it resources the development of which will\r\nemploy the energies of and yield a comfortable subsistence to a great\r\npopulation. The smallest of these new States, Washington, stands twelfth,\r\nand the largest, Montana, third, among the forty-two in area. The people of\r\nthese States are already well-trained, intelligent, and patriotic American\r\ncitizens, having common interests and sympathies with those of the older\r\nStates and a common purpose to defend the integrity and uphold the honor of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been called to the\r\nurgent need of Congressional legislation for the better protection of the\r\nlives and limbs of those engaged in operating the great interstate freight\r\nlines of the country, and especially of the yardmen and brakemen. A\r\npetition signed by nearly 10,000 railway brakemen was presented to the\r\nCommission asking that steps might be taken to bring about the use of\r\nautomatic brakes and couplers on freight cars.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of State railroad commissioners and their accredited\r\nrepresentatives held at Washington in March last upon the invitation of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission a resolution was unanimously adopted urging\r\nthe Commission \"to consider what can be done to prevent the loss of life\r\nand limb in coupling and uncoupling freight cars and in handling the brakes\r\nof such cars.\" During the year ending June 30, 1888, over 2,000 railroad\r\nemployees were killed in service and more than 20,000 injured. It is\r\ncompetent, I think, for Congress to require uniformity in the construction\r\nof cars used in interstate commerce and the use of improved safety\r\nappliances upon such trains. Time will be necessary to make the needed\r\nchanges, but an earnest and intelligent beginning should be made at once.\r\nIt is a reproach to our civilization that any class of American workmen\r\nshould in the pursuit of a necessary and useful vocation be subjected to a\r\nperil of life and limb as great as that of a soldier in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe creation of an Executive Department to be known as the Department of\r\nAgriculture by the act of February 9 last was a wise and timely response to\r\na request which had long been respectfully urged by the farmers of the\r\ncountry; but much remains to be done to perfect the organization of the\r\nDepartment so that it may fairly realize the expectations which its\r\ncreation excited. In this connection attention is called to the suggestions\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary, which is herewith submitted. The\r\nneed of a law officer for the Department such as is provided for the other\r\nExecutive Departments is manifest. The failure of the last Congress to make\r\nthe usual provision for the publication of the annual report should be\r\npromptly remedied. The public interest in the report and its value to the\r\nfarming community, I am sure, will not be diminished under the new\r\norganization of the Department.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the weather service be separated from the War Department\r\nand established as a bureau in the Department of Agriculture. This will\r\ninvolve an entire reorganization both of the Weather Bureau and of the\r\nSignal Corps, making of the first a purely civil organization and of the\r\nother a purely military staff corps. The report of the Chief Signal Officer\r\nshows that the work of the corps on its military side has been\r\ndeteriorating.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the people of the District of Columbia should not be lost\r\nsight of in the pressure for consideration of measures affecting the whole\r\ncountry. Having no legislature of its own, either municipal or general, its\r\npeople must look to Congress for the regulation of all those concerns that\r\nin the States are the subject of local control. Our whole people have an\r\ninterest that the national capital should be made attractive and beautiful,\r\nand, above all, that its repute for social order should be well maintained.\r\nThe laws regulating the sale of intoxicating drinks in the District should\r\nbe revised with a view to bringing the traffic under stringent limitations\r\nand control.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the power conferred upon me by the act making\r\nappropriations for the expenses of the District of Columbia for the year\r\nending June 30, 1890, I did on the 17th day of August last appoint Rudolph\r\nHering, of New York, Samuel M. Gray, of Rhode Island, and Frederick P.\r\nStearns, of Massachusetts, three eminent sanitary engineers, to examine and\r\nreport upon the system of sewerage existing in the District of Columbia.\r\nTheir report, which is not yet completed, will be in due course submitted\r\nto Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District is herewith transmitted,\r\nand the attention of Congress is called to the suggestions contained\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery\r\nof America by the opening of a world's fair or exposition in some one of\r\nour great cities will be presented for the consideration of Congress. The\r\nvalue and interest of such an exposition may well claim the promotion of\r\nthe General Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March last the Civil Service Commission had but a single\r\nmember. The vacancies were filled on the 7th day of May, and since then the\r\nCommissioners have been industriously, though with an inadequate force,\r\nengaged in executing the law. They were assured by me that a cordial\r\nsupport would be given them in the faithful and impartial enforcement of\r\nthe statute and of the rules and regulations adopted in aid of it.\r\n\r\nHeretofore the book of eligibles has been closed to everyone, except as\r\ncertifications were made upon the requisition of the appointing officers.\r\nThis secrecy was the source of much suspicion and of many charges of\r\nfavoritism in the administration of the law. What is secret is always\r\nsuspected; what is open can be judged. The Commission, with the full\r\napproval of all its members, has now opened the list of eligibles to the\r\npublic. The eligible lists for the classified post-offices and\r\ncustom-houses are now publicly posted in the respective offices, as are\r\nalso the certifications for appointments. The purpose of the civil-service\r\nlaw was absolutely to exclude any other consideration in connection with\r\nappointments under it than that of merit as tested by the examinations. The\r\nbusiness proceeds upon the theory that both the examining boards and the\r\nappointing officers are absolutely ignorant as to the political views and\r\nassociations of all persons on the civil-service lists. It is not too much\r\nto say, however, that some recent Congressional investigations have\r\nsomewhat shaken public confidence in the impartiality of the selections for\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory advance\r\nuntil the present law and its equal administration are well established in\r\nthe confidence of the people. It will be my pleasure, as it is my duty, to\r\nsee that the law is executed with firmness and impartiality. If some of its\r\nprovisions have been fraudulently evaded by appointing officers, our\r\nresentment should not suggest the repeal of the law, but reform in its\r\nadministration. We should have one view of the matter, and hold it with a\r\nsincerity that is not affected by the consideration that the party to which\r\nwe belong is for the time in power.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor, on the 4th day of January, 1889, by an Executive order to\r\ntake effect March 15, brought the Railway Mail Service under the operation\r\nof the civil-service law. Provision was made that the order should take\r\neffect sooner in any State where an eligible list was sooner obtained. On\r\nthe 11th day of March Mr. Lyman, then the only member of the Commission,\r\nreported to me in writing that it would not be possible to have the list of\r\neligibles ready before May 1, and requested that the taking effect of the\r\norder be postponed until that time, which was done, subject to the same\r\nprovision contained in the original order as to States in which an eligible\r\nlist was sooner obtained.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the revision of the rules, of the new classification, and of\r\nthe inclusion of the Railway Mail Service, the work of the Commission has\r\nbeen greatly increased, and the present clerical force is found to be\r\ninadequate. I recommend that the additional clerks asked by the Commission\r\nbe appropriated for.\r\n\r\nThe duty of appointment is devolved by the Constitution or by the law, and\r\nthe appointing officers are properly held to a high responsibility in its\r\nexercise. The growth of the country and the consequent increase of the\r\ncivil list have magnified this function of the Executive disproportionally.\r\nIt can not be denied, however, that the labor connected with this necessary\r\nwork is increased, often to the point of actual distress, by the sudden and\r\nexcessive demands that are made upon an incoming Administration for\r\nremovals and appointments. But, on the other hand, it is not true that\r\nincumbency is a conclusive argument for continuance in office.\r\nImpartiality, moderation, fidelity to public duty, and a good attainment in\r\nthe discharge of it must be added before the argument is complete. When\r\nthose holding administrative offices so conduct themselves as to convince\r\njust political opponents that no party consideration or bias affects in any\r\nway the discharge of their public duties, we can more easily stay the\r\ndemand for removals.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that both in and out of the classified service great benefit\r\nwould accrue from the adoption of some system by which the officer would\r\nreceive the distinction and benefit that in all private employments comes\r\nfrom exceptional faithfulness and efficiency in the performance of duty.\r\n\r\nI have suggested to the heads of the Executive Departments that they\r\nconsider whether a record might not be kept in each bureau of all those\r\nelements that are covered by the terms \"faithfulness\" and \"efficiency,\" and\r\na rating made showing the relative merits of the clerks of each class, this\r\nrating to be regarded as a test of merit in making promotions.\r\n\r\nI have also suggested to the Postmaster-General that he adopt some plan by\r\nwhich he can, upon the basis of the reports to the Department and of\r\nfrequent inspections, indicate the relative merit of postmasters of each\r\nclass. They will be appropriately indicated in the Official Register and in\r\nthe report of the Department. That a great stimulus would thus be given to\r\nthe whole service I do not doubt, and such a record would be the best\r\ndefense against inconsiderate removals from office.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the General Government in the education of the people found\r\nan early expression, not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warning\r\nutterances of our ablest statesmen, but in liberal appropriations from the\r\ncommon resources for the support of education in the new States. No one\r\nwill deny that it is of the gravest national concern that those who hold\r\nthe ultimate control of all public affairs should have the necessary\r\nintelligence wisely to direct and determine them. National aid to education\r\nhas heretofore taken the form of land grants, and in that form the\r\nconstitutional power of Congress to promote the education of the people is\r\nnot seriously questioned. I do not think it can be successfully questioned\r\nwhen the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the public\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nSuch aid should be, as it always has been, suggested by some exceptional\r\nconditions. The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the South, the\r\nbestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, and the impairment of the\r\nability of the States where these new citizens were chiefly found to\r\nadequately provide educational facilities presented not only exceptional\r\nbut unexampled conditions. That the situation has been much ameliorated\r\nthere is no doubt. The ability and interest of the States have happily\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nBut a great work remains to be done, and I think the General Government\r\nshould lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant in aid of\r\neducation grows chiefly out of the condition and needs of the emancipated\r\nslave and his descendants, the relief should as far as possible, while\r\nnecessarily proceeding upon some general lines, be applied to the need that\r\nsuggested it. It is essential, if much good is to be accomplished, that the\r\nsympathy and active interest of the people of the States should be\r\nenlisted, and that the methods adopted should be such as to stimulate and\r\nnot to supplant local taxation for school purposes.\r\n\r\nAs one Congress can not bind a succeeding one in such a case and as the\r\neffort must in some degree be experimental, I recommend that any\r\nappropriation made for this purpose be so limited in annual amount and as\r\nto the time over which it is to extend as will on the one hand give the\r\nlocal school authorities opportunity to make the best use of the first\r\nyear's allowance, and on the other deliver them from the temptation to\r\nunduly postpone the assumption of the whole burden themselves.\r\n\r\nThe colored people did not intrude themselves upon us. They were brought\r\nhere in chains and held in the communities where they are now chiefly found\r\nby a cruel slave code. Happily for both races, they are now free. They have\r\nfrom a standpoint of ignorance and poverty--which was our shame, not\r\ntheirs--made remarkable advances in education and in the acquisition of\r\nproperty. They have as a people shown themselves to be friendly and\r\nfaithful toward the white race under temptations of tremendous strength.\r\nThey have their representatives in the national cemeteries, where a\r\ngrateful Government has gathered the ashes of those who died in its\r\ndefense. They have furnished to our Regular Army regiments that have won\r\nhigh praise from their commanding officers for courage and soldierly\r\nqualities and for fidelity to the enlistment oath. In civil life they are\r\nnow the toilers of their communities, making their full contribution to the\r\nwidening streams of prosperity which these communities are receiving. Their\r\nsudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disorder into the\r\nhousehold as well as the shop. Generally they do not desire to quit their\r\nhomes, and their employers resent the interference of the emigration agents\r\nwho seek to stimulate such a desire.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this, in many parts of our country where the\r\ncolored population is large the people of that race are by various devices\r\ndeprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of\r\ntheir civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes\r\nare suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.\r\n\r\nIt has been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of\r\nrespect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evils.\r\nSurely no one supposes that the present can be accepted as a permanent\r\ncondition. If it is said that these communities must work out this problem\r\nfor themselves, we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it. Do\r\nthey suggest any solution? When and under what conditions is the black man\r\nto have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights\r\nwhich have so long been his in law? When is that equality of influence\r\nwhich our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be\r\nrestored? This generation should courageously face these grave questions,\r\nand not leave them as a heritage of woe to the next. The consultation\r\nshould proceed with candor, calmness, and great patience, upon the lines of\r\njustice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty. No question in our\r\ncountry can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI earnestly invoke the attention of Congress to the consideration of such\r\nmeasures within its well-defined constitutional powers as will secure to\r\nall our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other\r\ncivil right under the Constitution and laws of the United States. No evil,\r\nhowever deplorable, can justify the assumption either on the part of the\r\nExecutive or of Congress of powers not granted, but both will be highly\r\nblamable if all the powers granted are not wisely but firmly used to\r\ncorrect these evils. The power to take the whole direction and control of\r\nthe election of members of the House of Representatives is clearly given to\r\nthe General Government. A partial and qualified supervision of these\r\nelections is now provided for by law, and in my opinion this law may be so\r\nstrengthened and extended as to secure on the whole better results than can\r\nbe attained by a law taking all the processes of such election into Federal\r\ncontrol. The colored man should be protected in all of his relations to the\r\nFederal Government, whether as litigant, juror, or witness in our courts,\r\nas an elector for members of Congress, or as a peaceful traveler upon our\r\ninterstate railways.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more justly humiliating to the national pride and nothing\r\nmore hurtful to the national prosperity than the inferiority of our\r\nmerchant marine compared with that of other nations whose general\r\nresources, wealth, and seacoast lines do not suggest any reason for their\r\nsupremacy on the sea. It was not always so, and our people are agreed, I\r\nthink, that it shall not continue to be so. It is not possible in this\r\ncommunication to discuss the causes of the decay of our shipping interests\r\nor the differing methods by which it is proposed to restore them. The\r\nstatement of a few well-authenticated facts and some general suggestions as\r\nto legislation is all that is practicable. That the great steamship lines\r\nsailing under the flags of England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, and\r\nengaged in foreign commerce, were .promoted and have since been and now are\r\nliberally aided by grants of public money in one form or another is\r\ngenerally known. That the American lines of steamships have been abandoned\r\nby us to an unequal contest with the aided lines of other nations until\r\nthey have been withdrawn, or in the few cases where they are still\r\nmaintained are subject to serious disadvantages, is matter of common\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe present situation is such that travelers and merchandise find Liverpool\r\noften a necessary intermediate port between New York and some of the South\r\nAmerican capitals. The fact that some of the delegates from South American\r\nStates to the conference of American nations now in session at Washington\r\nreached our shores by reversing that line of travel is very conclusive of\r\nthe need of such a conference and very suggestive as to the first and most\r\nnecessary step in the direction of fuller and more beneficial intercourse\r\nwith nations that are now our neighbors upon the lines of latitude, but not\r\nupon the lines of established commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nI recommend that such appropriations be made for ocean mail service in\r\nAmerican steamships between our ports and those of Central and South\r\nAmerica, China, Japan, and the important islands in both of the great\r\noceans as will be liberally remunerative for the service rendered and as\r\nwill encourage the establishment and in some fair degree equalize the\r\nchances of American steamship lines in the competitions which they must\r\nmeet. That the American States lying south of us will cordially cooperate\r\nin establishing and maintaining such lines of steamships to their principal\r\nports I do not doubt.\r\n\r\nWe should also make provision for a naval reserve to consist of such\r\nmerchant ships of American construction and of a specified tonnage and\r\nspeed as the owners will consent to place at the use of the Government in\r\ncase of need as armed cruisers. England has adopted this policy, and as a\r\nresult can now upon necessity at once place upon her naval list some of the\r\nfastest steamships in the world. A proper supervision of the construction\r\nof such vessels would make their conversion into effective ships of war\r\nvery easy.\r\n\r\nI am an advocate of economy in our national expenditures, but it is a\r\nmisuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that withholds an\r\nexpenditure for the purpose of extending our foreign commerce. The\r\nenlargement and improvement of our merchant marine, the development of a\r\nsufficient body of trained American seamen, the promotion of rapid and\r\nregular mail communication between the ports of other countries and our\r\nown, and the adaptation of large and swift American merchant steamships to\r\nnaval uses in time of war are public purposes of the highest concern. The\r\nenlarged participation of our people in the carrying trade, the new and\r\nincreased markets that will be opened for the products of our farms and\r\nfactories, and the fuller and better employment of our mechanics which will\r\nresult from a liberal promotion of our foreign commerce insure the widest\r\npossible diffusion of benefit to all the States and to all our people.\r\nEverything is most propitious for the present inauguration of a liberal and\r\nprogressive policy upon this subject, and we should enter upon it with\r\npromptness and decision.\r\n\r\nThe legislation which I have suggested, it is sincerely believed, will\r\npromote the peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and security\r\nof the people. I invoke the diligent and serious attention of Congress to\r\nthe consideration of these and such other measures as may be presented\r\nhaving the same great end in view.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nBenjamin Harrison\r\nDecember 1, 1890\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe reports of the several Executive Departments, which will be laid before\r\nCongress in the usual course, will exhibit in detail the operations of the\r\nGovernment for the last fiscal year. Only the more important incidents and\r\nresults, and chiefly such as may be the foundation of the recommendations I\r\nshall submit, will be referred to in this annual message.\r\n\r\nThe vast and increasing business of the Government has been transacted by\r\nthe several Departments during the year with faithfulness, energy, and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe revenues, amounting to above $450,000,000, have been collected and\r\ndisbursed without revealing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case of\r\ndefalcation or embezzlement. An earnest effort has been made to stimulate a\r\nsense of responsibility and public duty in all officers and employees of\r\nevery grade, and the work done by them has almost wholly escaped\r\nunfavorable criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom because the\r\ncredit of this good work is not mine, but is shared by the heads of the\r\nseveral Departments with the great body of faithful officers and employees\r\nwho serve under them. The closest scrutiny of Congress is invited to all\r\nthe methods of administration and to every item of expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of the\r\nEast have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common interest\r\nthat bind us to the States of the Western Hemisphere have been notably\r\nstrengthened by the conference held in this capital to consider measures\r\nfor the general welfare. Pursuant to the invitation authorized by Congress,\r\nthe representatives of every independent State of the American continent\r\nand of Hayti met in conference in this capital in October, 1889, and\r\ncontinued in session until the 19th of last April. This important\r\nconvocation marks a most interesting and influential epoch in the history\r\nof the Western Hemisphere. It is noteworthy that Brazil, invited while\r\nunder an imperial form of government, shared as a republic in the\r\ndeliberations and results of the conference. The recommendations of this\r\nconference were all transmitted to Congress at the last session.\r\n\r\nThe International Marine Conference, which sat at Washington last winter,\r\nreached a very gratifying result. The regulations suggested have been\r\nbrought to the attention of all the Governments represented, and their\r\ngeneral adoption is confidently expected. The legislation of Congress at\r\nthe last session is in conformity with the propositions of the conference,\r\nand the proclamation therein provided for will be issued when the other\r\npowers have given notice of their adhesion.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of Brussels, to devise means for suppressing the slave trade\r\nin Africa, afforded an opportunity for a new expression of the interest the\r\nAmerican people feel in that great work. It soon became evident that the\r\nmeasure proposed would tax the resources of the Kongo Basin beyond the\r\nrevenues available under the general act of Berlin of 1884. The United\r\nStates, not being a party to that act, could not share in its revision, but\r\nby a separate act the Independent State of the Kongo was freed from the\r\nrestrictions upon a customs revenue. The demoralizing and destructive\r\ntraffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnest\r\nattention of the conference, and the delegates of the United States were\r\nforemost in advocating measures for its repression. An accord was reached\r\nthe influence of which will be very helpful and extend over a wide region.\r\nAs soon as these measures shall receive the sanction of the Netherlands,\r\nfor a time withheld, the general acts will be submitted for ratification by\r\nthe Senate. Meanwhile negotiations have been opened for a new and completed\r\ntreaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States\r\nand the Independent State of the Kongo.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the past year the only independent monarchical government\r\non the Western Continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist, and was\r\nsucceeded by a republic. Diplomatic relations were at once established with\r\nthe new Government, but it was not completely recognized until an\r\nopportunity had been afforded to ascertain that it had popular approval and\r\nsupport. When the course of events had yielded assurance of this fact, no\r\ntime was lost in extending to the new Government a full and cordial welcome\r\ninto the family of American Commonwealths. It is confidently believed that\r\nthe good relations of the two countries will be preserved and that the\r\nfuture will witness an increased intimacy of intercourse and an expansion\r\nof their mutual commerce.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a\r\nrevolutionary change in Salvador, which was not recognized by other States,\r\nand hostilities broke out between Salvador and Guatemala, threatening to\r\ninvolve all Central America in conflict and to undo the progress which had\r\nbeen made toward a union of their interests. The efforts of this Government\r\nwere promptly and zealously exerted to compose their differences, and\r\nthrough the active efforts of the representative of the United States a\r\nprovisional treaty of peace was signed August 26, whereby the right of the\r\nRepublic of Salvador to choose its own rulers was recognized. General\r\nEzeta, the chief of the Provisional Government, has since been confirmed in\r\nthe Presidency by the Assembly, and diplomatic recognition duly followed.\r\n\r\nThe killing of General Barrundia on board the Pacific mail steamer\r\nAcapulco, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala,\r\ndemanded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary attempt to\r\ninvade Guatemala from Mexican territory, General Barrundia took passage at\r\nAcapulco for Panama. The consent of the representatives of the United\r\nStates was sought to effect his seizure, first at Champerico, where the\r\nsteamer touched, and afterwards at San Jose. The captain of the steamer\r\nrefused to give up his passenger without a written order from the United\r\nStates minister. The latter furnished the desired letter, stipulating as\r\nthe condition of his action that General Barrundia's life should be spared\r\nand that he should be tried only for offenses growing out of his\r\ninsurrectionary movements. This letter was produced to the captain of the\r\nAcapulco by the military commander at San Jose as his warrant to take the\r\npassenger from the steamer. General Barrundia resisted capture and was\r\nkilled. It being evident that the minister, Mr. Mizner, had exceeded the\r\nbounds of his authority in intervening, in compliance with the demands of\r\nthe Guatemalan authorities, to authorize and effect, in violation of\r\nprecedent, the seizure on a vessel of the United States of a passenger in\r\ntransit charged with political offenses, in order that he might be tried\r\nfor such offenses under what was described as martial law, I was\r\nconstrained to disavow Mr. Mizner's act and recall him from his post.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens, is making\r\nmost encouraging progress, all the preliminary conditions and initial\r\noperations having been accomplished within the prescribed time.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year negotiations have been renewed for the settlement of\r\nthe claims of American citizens against the Government of Chile,\r\nprincipally growing out of the late war with Peru. The reports from our\r\nminister at Santiago warrant the expectation of an early and satisfactory\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nOur relations with China, which have for several years occupied so\r\nimportant a place in our diplomatic history, have called for careful\r\nconsideration and have been the subject of much correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe communications of the Chinese minister have brought into view the whole\r\nsubject of our conventional relations with his country, and at the same\r\ntime this Government, through its legation at Peking, has sought to arrange\r\nvarious matters and complaints touching the interests and protection of our\r\ncitizens in China.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the concurrent resolution of October 1, 1890, I have\r\nproposed to the Governments of Mexico and Great Britain to consider a\r\nconventional regulation of the passage of Chinese laborers across our\r\nsouthern and northern frontiers.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of August last Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator selected\r\nunder the treaty of December 6, 1888, rendered an award to the effect that\r\nno compensation was due from the Danish Government to the United States on\r\naccount of what is commonly known as the Carlos Butterfield claim.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the French Republic continue to be cordial. Our\r\nrepresentative at that court has very diligently urged the removal of the\r\nrestrictions imposed upon our meat products, and it is believed that\r\nsubstantial progress has been made toward a just settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Samoan treaty, signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of the\r\nUnited States, Germany, and Great Britain, after due ratification and\r\nexchange, has begun to produce salutary effects. The formation of the\r\ngovernment agreed upon will soon replace the disorder of the past by a\r\nstable administration alike just to the natives and equitable to the three\r\npowers most concerned in trade and intercourse with the Samoan Islands. The\r\nchief justice has been chosen by the King of Sweden and Norway on the\r\ninvitation of the three powers, and will soon be installed. The land\r\ncommission and the municipal council are in process of organization. A\r\nrational and evenly distributed scheme of taxation, both municipal and upon\r\nimports, is in operation. Malietoa is respected as King.\r\n\r\nThe new treaty of extradition with Great Britain, after due ratification,\r\nwas proclaimed on the 25th of last March. Its beneficial working is already\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two Governments touching the fur-seal question\r\nin the Bering Sea is not yet adjusted, as will be seen by the\r\ncorrespondence which will soon be laid before the Congress. The offer to\r\nsubmit the question to arbitration, as proposed by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, has not been accepted, for the reason that the form of\r\nsubmission proposed is not thought to be calculated to assure a conclusion\r\nsatisfactory to either party. It is sincerely hoped that before the opening\r\nof another sealing season some arrangement may be effected which will\r\nassure to the United States a property right derived from Russia, which was\r\nnot disregarded by any nation for more than eighty years preceding the\r\noutbreak of the existing trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the tariff act a wrong was done to the Kingdom of Hawaii which I am\r\nbound to presume was wholly unintentional. Duties were levied on certain\r\ncommodities which are included in the reciprocity treaty now existing\r\nbetween the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indicating the\r\nnecessary exception in favor of that Kingdom. I hope Congress will repair\r\nwhat might otherwise seem to be a breach of faith on the part of this\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAn award in favor of the United States in the matter of the claim of Mr.\r\nVan Bokkelen against Hayti was rendered on the 4th of December, 1888, but\r\nowing to disorders then and afterwards prevailing in Hayti the terms of\r\npayment were not observed. A new agreement as to the time of payment has\r\nbeen approved and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of the\r\nUnited States for redress of wrongs suffered during the late political\r\nconflict in Hayti will, it is hoped, speedily yield to friendly treatment.\r\n\r\nPropositions for the amendment of the treaty of extradition between the\r\nUnited States and Italy are now under consideration.\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to provide the means of accepting the invitation of the\r\nItalian Government to take part in an approaching conference to consider\r\nthe adoption of a universal prime meridian from which to reckon longitude\r\nand time. As this proposal follows in the track of the reform sought to be\r\ninitiated by the Meridian Conference of Washington, held on the invitation\r\nof this Government, the United States should manifest a friendly interest\r\nin the Italian proposal.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may refer with approval to the suggestion of my\r\npredecessors that standing provision be made for accepting, whenever deemed\r\nadvisable, the frequent invitations of foreign governments to share in\r\nconferences looking to the advancement of international reforms in regard\r\nto science, sanitation, commercial laws and procedure, and other matters\r\naffecting the intercourse and progress of modern communities.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time threatened\r\nto interrupt the cordiality of our relations with the Government of\r\nPortugal. That Government seized the Delagoa Bay Railway, which was\r\nconstructed under a concession granted to an American citizen, and at the\r\nsame time annulled the charter. The concessionary, who had embarked his\r\nfortune in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of redress, was\r\ncompelled to invoke the protection of his Government. Our representations,\r\nmade coincidently with those of the British Government, whose subjects were\r\nalso largely interested, happily resulted in the recognition by Portugal of\r\nthe propriety of submitting the claim for indemnity growing out of its\r\naction to arbitration. This plan of settlement having been agreed upon, the\r\ninterested powers readily concurred in the proposal to submit the case to\r\nthe judgment of three eminent jurists, to be designated by the President of\r\nthe Swiss Republic, who, upon the joint invitation of the Governments of\r\nthe United States, Great Britain, and Portugal, has selected persons well\r\nqualified for the task before them.\r\n\r\nThe revision of our treaty relations with the Empire of Japan has continued\r\nto be the subject of consideration and of correspondence. The questions\r\ninvolved are both grave and delicate; and while it will be my duty to see\r\nthat the interests of the United States are not by any changes exposed to\r\nundue discrimination, I sincerely hope that such revision as will satisfy\r\nthe legitimate expectations of the Japanese Government and maintain the\r\npresent and long-existing friendly relations between Japan and the United\r\nStates will be effected.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between our country and Mexico, born of close neighborhood\r\nand strengthened by many considerations of intimate intercourse and\r\nreciprocal interest, has never been more conspicuous than now nor more\r\nhopeful of increased benefit to both nations. The intercourse of the two\r\ncountries by rail, already great, is making constant growth. The\r\nestablished lines and those recently projected add to the intimacy of\r\ntraffic and open new channels of access to fresh areas of demand and\r\nsupply. The importance of the Mexican railway system will be further\r\nenhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a\r\nlink in the projected intercontinental railway. I recommend that our\r\nmission in the City of Mexico be raised to the first class.\r\n\r\nThe cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope that by\r\nthe continuance of methods of friendly negotiation much may be accomplished\r\nin the direction of an adjustment of pending questions and of the increase\r\nof our trade. The extent and development of our trade with the island of\r\nCuba invest the commercial relations of the United States and Spain with a\r\npeculiar importance. It is not doubted that a special arrangement in regard\r\nto commerce, based upon the reciprocity provision of the recent tariff act,\r\nwould operate most beneficially for both Governments. This subject is now\r\nreceiving attention.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a\r\ngratifying occasion to honor the memory of the great inventor, to whose\r\ngenius our country owes so much, and to bear witness to the unbroken\r\nfriendship which has existed between the land which bore him and our own,\r\nwhich claimed him as a citizen.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September last the commission appointed to revise the\r\nproceedings of the commission under the claims convention between the\r\nUnited States and Venezuela of 1866 brought its labors to a close within\r\nthe period fixed for that purpose. The proceedings of the late commission\r\nwere characterized by a spirit of impartiality and a high sense of justice,\r\nand an incident which was for many years the subject of discussion between\r\nthe two Governments has been disposed of in a manner alike honorable and\r\nsatisfactory to both parties. For the settlement of the claim of the\r\nVenezuela Steam Transportation Company, which was the subject of a joint\r\nresolution adopted at the last session of Congress, negotiations are still\r\nin progress, and their early conclusion is anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the past few years has evinced on the part of Congress a\r\ngrowing realization of the importance of the consular service in fostering\r\nour commercial relations abroad and in protecting the domestic revenues. As\r\nthe scope of operations expands increased provision must be made to keep up\r\nthe essential standard of efficiency. The necessity of some adequate\r\nmeasure of supervision and inspection has been so often presented that I\r\nneed only commend the subject to your attention.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1890, were $463,963,080.55 and the total expenditures for the same\r\nperiod were $358,618,584.52. The postal receipts have not heretofore been\r\nincluded in the statement of these aggregates, and for the purpose of\r\ncomparison the sum of $60,882,097.92 should be deducted from both sides of\r\nthe account. The surplus for the year, including the amount applied to the\r\nsinking fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts for 1890 were\r\n$16,030,923.79 and the expenditures $15,739,871 in excess of those of 1889.\r\nThe customs receipts increased $5,835,842.88 and the receipts from internal\r\nrevenue $11,725,191.89, while on the side of expenditures that for pensions\r\nwas $19,312,075.96 in excess of the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury statement for the current fiscal year, partly actual and\r\npartly estimated, is as follows: Receipts from all sources, $406,000,000;\r\ntotal expenditures, $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,000,000, not\r\ntaking the postal receipts into the account on either side. The loss of\r\nrevenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated at $25,000,000, but\r\nfrom this is deducted a gain of about $16,000,000 realized during the first\r\nfour months of the year.\r\n\r\nFor the year 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000 and the\r\nestimated expenditures $357,852,209.42, leaving an estimated surplus of\r\n$15,247,790.58, which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the beginning\r\nof the year, will give $67,247,790.58 as the sum available for the\r\nredemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of receipts\r\nand expenditures for the Post-Office Department, being equal, are not\r\nincluded in this statement on either side.\r\n\r\nThe act \"directing the purchase of silver bullion and the issue of Treasury\r\nnotes thereon,\" approved July 14, 1890, has been administered by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury with an earnest purpose to get into circulation\r\nat the earliest possible dates the full monthly amounts of Treasury notes\r\ncontemplated by its provisions and at the same time to give to the market\r\nfor the silver bullion such support as the law contemplates. The recent\r\ndepreciation in the price of silver has been observed with regret. The\r\nrapid rise in price which anticipated and followed the passage of the act\r\nwas influenced in some degree by speculation, and the recent reaction is in\r\npart the result of the same cause and in part of the recent monetary\r\ndisturbances. Some months of further trial will be necessary to determine\r\nthe permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver values, but it\r\nis gratifying to know that the increased circulation secured by the act has\r\nexerted, and will continue to exert, a most beneficial influence upon\r\nbusiness and upon general values.\r\n\r\nWhile it has not been thought best to renew formally the suggestion of an\r\ninternational conference looking to an agreement touching the full use of\r\nsilver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care has been taken to observe\r\nclosely any change in the situation abroad, and no favorable opportunity\r\nwill be lost to promote a result which it is confidently believed would\r\nconfer very large benefits upon the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nThe recent monetary disturbances in England are not unlikely to suggest a\r\nreexamination of opinions upon this subject. Our very large supply of gold\r\nwill, if not lost by impulsive legislation in the supposed interest of\r\nsilver, give us a position of advantage in promoting a permanent and safe\r\ninternational agreement for the free use of silver as a coin metal.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Secretary to increase the volume of money in circulation\r\nby keeping down the Treasury surplus to the lowest practicable limit have\r\nbeen unremitting and in a very high degree successful. The tables presented\r\nby him showing the increase of money in circulation during the last two\r\ndecades, and especially the table showing the increase during the nineteen\r\nmonths he has administered the affairs of the Department, are interesting\r\nand instructive. The increase of money in circulation during the nineteen\r\nmonths has been in the aggregate $93,866,813, or about $1.50 per capita,\r\nand of this increase only $7,100,000 was due to the recent silver\r\nlegislation. That this substantial and needed aid given to commerce\r\nresulted in an enormous reduction of the public debt and of the annual\r\ninterest charge is matter of increased satisfaction. There have been\r\npurchased and redeemed since March 4, 1889, 4 and 4 1\\2 per cent bonds to\r\nthe amount of $211,832,450, at a cost of $246,620,741, resulting in the\r\nreduction of the annual interest charge of $8,967,609 and a total saving of\r\ninterest of $51,576,706.\r\n\r\nI notice with great pleasure the statement of the Secretary that the\r\nreceipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year\r\nnearly $12,000,000, and that the cost of collecting this larger revenue was\r\nless by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year. The\r\npercentage of cost of collecting the customs revenue was less for the last\r\nfiscal year than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe Customs Administration Board, provided for by the act of June 10, 1890,\r\nwas selected with great care, and is composed in part of men whose previous\r\nexperience in the administration of the old customs regulations had made\r\nthem familiar with the evils to be remedied, and in part of men whose legal\r\nand judicial acquirements and experience seemed to fit them for the work of\r\ninterpreting and applying the new statute. The chief aim of the law is to\r\nsecure honest valuations of all dutiable merchandise and to make these\r\nvaluations uniform at all our ports of entry. It had been made manifest by\r\na Congressional investigation that a system of undervaluation had been long\r\nin use by certain classes of importers, resulting not only in a great loss\r\nof revenue, but in a most intolerable discrimination against honesty. It is\r\nnot seen how this legislation, when it is understood, can be regarded by\r\nthe citizens of any country having commercial dealings with us as\r\nunfriendly. If any duty is supposed to be excessive, let the complaint be\r\nlodged there. It will surely not be claimed by any well-disposed people\r\nthat a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system of quasi smuggling.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War exhibits several gratifying results\r\nattained during the year by wise and unostentatious methods. The percentage\r\nof desertions from the Army (an evil for which both Congress and the\r\nDepartment have long been seeking a remedy) has been reduced during the\r\npast year 24 per cent, and for the months of August and September, during\r\nwhich time the favorable effects of the act of June 16 were felt, 33 per\r\ncent, as compared with the same months of 1889.\r\n\r\nThe results attained by a reorganization and consolidation of the divisions\r\nhaving charge of the hospital and service records of the volunteer soldiers\r\nare very remarkable. This change was effected in July, 1889, and at that\r\ntime there were 40,654 cases awaiting attention, more than half of these\r\nbeing calls from the Pension Office for information necessary to the\r\nadjudication of pension claims. On the 30th day of June last, though over\r\n300,000 new calls had come in, there was not a single case that had not\r\nbeen examined and answered.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendations of the Secretary that adequate and regular\r\nappropriations be continued for coast-defense works and ordnance. Plans\r\nhave been practically agreed upon, and there can be no good reason for\r\ndelaying the execution of them, while the defenseless state of our great\r\nseaports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expedition.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement that has been extended to the militia of the States,\r\ngenerally and most appropriately designated the \"National Guard,\" should be\r\ncontinued and enlarged. These military organizations constitute in a large\r\nsense the Army of the United States, while about five-sixths of the annual\r\ncost of their maintenance is defrayed by the States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General is under the law submitted directly to\r\nCongress, but as the Department of Justice is one of the Executive\r\nDepartments some reference to the work done is appropriate here.\r\n\r\nA vigorous and in the main an effective effort has been made to bring to\r\ntrial and punishment all violators of the law, but at the same time care\r\nhas been taken that frivolous and technical offenses should not be used to\r\nswell the fees of officers or to harass well-disposed citizens. Especial\r\nattention is called to the facts connected with the prosecution of\r\nviolations of the election laws and of offenses against United States\r\nofficers. The number of convictions secured, very many of them upon pleas\r\nof guilty, will, it is hoped, have a salutary restraining influence. There\r\nhave been several cases where postmasters appointed by me have been\r\nsubjected to violent interference in the discharge of their official duties\r\nand to persecutions and personal violence of the most extreme character.\r\nSome of these cases have been dealt with through the Department of Justice,\r\nand in some cases the post-offices have been abolished or suspended. I have\r\ndirected the Postmaster-General to pursue this course in all cases where\r\nother efforts failed to secure for any postmaster not himself in fault an\r\nopportunity peacefully to exercise the duties of his office. But such\r\naction will not supplant the efforts of the Department of Justice to bring\r\nthe particular offenders to punishment.\r\n\r\nThe vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates of\r\nnaturalization, upon bills in equity filed by the Attorney-General in the\r\ncircuit court of the United States, is a new application of a familiar\r\nequity jurisdiction. Nearly one hundred such decrees have been taken during\r\nthe year, the evidence disclosing that a very large number of fraudulent\r\ncertificates of naturalization have been issued. And in this connection I\r\nbeg to renew my recommendation that the laws be so amended as to require a\r\nmore full and searching inquiry into all the facts necessary to\r\nnaturalization before any certificates are granted. It certainly is not too\r\nmuch to require that an application for American citizenship shall be heard\r\nwith as much care and recorded with as much formality as are given to cases\r\ninvolving the pettiest property right.\r\n\r\nAt the last session I returned without my approval a bill entitled \"An act\r\nto prohibit bookmaking and pool selling in the District of Columbia,\" and\r\nstated my objection to be that it did not prohibit but in fact licensed\r\nwhat it purported to prohibit. An effort will be made under existing laws\r\nto suppress this evil, though it is not certain that they will be found\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows the most gratifying progress in\r\nthe important work committed to his direction. The business methods have\r\nbeen greatly improved. A large economy in expenditures and an increase of\r\nfour and three-quarters millions in receipts have been realized. The\r\ndeficiency this year is $5,786,300, as against $6,350,183 last year,\r\nnotwithstanding the great enlargement of the service. Mail routes have been\r\nextended and quickened and greater accuracy and dispatch in distribution\r\nand delivery have been attained. The report will be found to be full of\r\ninterest and suggestion, not only to Congress, but to those thoughtful\r\ncitizens who may be interested to know what business methods can do for\r\nthat department of public administration which most nearly touches all our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the act to amend certain sections of the Revised Statutes\r\nrelating to lotteries, approved September 19, 1890, has been received with\r\ngreat and deserved popular favor. The Post-Office Department and the\r\nDepartment of Justice at once entered upon the enforcement of the law with\r\nsympathetic vigor, and already the public mails have been largely freed\r\nfrom the fraudulent and demoralizing appeals and literature emanating from\r\nthe lottery companies.\r\n\r\nThe construction and equipment of the new ships for the Navy have made very\r\nsatisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have been put\r\nin commission, and during this winter four more, including one monitor,\r\nwill be added. The construction of the other vessels authorized is being\r\npushed both in the Government and private yards with energy and watched\r\nwith the most scrupulous care.\r\n\r\nThe experiments conducted during the year to test the relative resisting\r\npower of armor plates have been so valuable as to attract great attention\r\nin Europe. The only part of the work upon the new ships that is threatened\r\nby unusual delay is the armor plating, and every effort is being made to\r\nreduce that to the minimum. It is a source of congratulation that the\r\nanticipated influence of these modern vessels upon the esprit de corps of\r\nthe officers and seamen has been fully realized. Confidence and pride in\r\nthe ship among the crew are equivalent to a secondary battery. Your\r\nfavorable consideration is invited to the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits with great fullness\r\nand clearness the vast work of that Department and the satisfactory results\r\nattained. The suggestions made by him are earnestly commended to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, though they can not all be given particular\r\nmention here.\r\n\r\nThe several acts of Congress looking to the reduction of the larger Indian\r\nreservations, to the more rapid settlement of the Indians upon individual\r\nallotments, and the restoration to the public domain of lands in excess of\r\ntheir needs have been largely carried into effect so far as the work was\r\nconfided to the Executive. Agreements have been concluded since March 4,\r\n1889, involving the cession to the United States of about 14,726,000 acres\r\nof land. These contracts have, as required by law, been submitted to\r\nCongress for ratification and for the appropriations necessary to carry\r\nthem into effect. Those with the Sisseton and Wahpeton, Sac and Fox, Iowa,\r\nPottawatomies and Absentee Shawnees, and Coeur d'Alene tribes have not yet\r\nreceived the sanction of Congress. Attention is also called to the fact\r\nthat the appropriations made in the case of the Sioux Indians have not\r\ncovered all the stipulated payments. This should be promptly corrected. If\r\nan agreement is confirmed, all of its terms should be complied with without\r\ndelay and full appropriations should be made.\r\n\r\nThe policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the patenting\r\nof lands to settlers upon the public domain has been carried out in the\r\nadministration of the Land Office. No general suspicion or imputation of\r\nfraud has been allowed to delay the hearing and adjudication of individual\r\ncases upon their merits. The purpose has been to perfect the title of\r\nhonest settlers with such promptness that the value of the entry might not\r\nbe swallowed up by the expense and extortions to which delay subjected the\r\nclaimant. The average monthly issue of agricultural patents has been\r\nincreased about 6,000.\r\n\r\nThe disability-pension act, which was approved on the 27th of June last,\r\nhas been put into operation as rapidly as was practicable. The increased\r\nclerical force provided was selected and assigned to work, and a\r\nconsiderable part of the force engaged in examinations in the field was\r\nrecalled and added to the working force of the office. The examination and\r\nadjudication of claims have by reason of improved methods been more rapid\r\nthan ever before. There is no economy to the Government in delay, while\r\nthere is much hardship and injustice to the soldier. The anticipated\r\nexpenditure, while very large, will not, it is believed, be in excess of\r\nthe estimates made before the enactment of the law. This liberal\r\nenlargement of the general law should suggest a more careful scrutiny of\r\nbills for special relief, both as to the cases where relief is granted and\r\nas to the amount allowed.\r\n\r\nThe increasing numbers and influence of the non-Mormon population of Utah\r\nare observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff,\r\npresident of the Mormon Church, in which he advised his people \"to refrain\r\nfrom contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the land,\" has\r\nattracted wide attention, and it is hoped that its influence will be highly\r\nbeneficial in restraining infractions of the laws of the United States. But\r\nthe fact should not be overlooked that the doctrine or belief of the church\r\nthat polygamous marriages are rightful and supported by divine revelation\r\nremains unchanged. President Woodruff does not renounce the doctrine, but\r\nrefrains from teaching it, and advises against the practice of it because\r\nthe law is against it. Now, it is quite true that the law should not\r\nattempt to deal with the faith or belief of anyone; but it is quite another\r\nthing, and the only safe thing, so to deal with the Territory of Utah as\r\nthat those who believe polygamy to be rightful shall not have the power to\r\nmake it lawful.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the States of Wyoming and Idaho to the Union are events\r\nfull of interest and congratulation, not only to the people of those States\r\nnow happily endowed with a full participation in our privileges and\r\nresponsibilities, but to all our people. Another belt of States stretches\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Patent Office has won from all sources very high\r\ncommendation. The amount accomplished has been very largely increased, and\r\nall the results have been such as to secure confidence and consideration\r\nfor the suggestions of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of the people of the United States under the provisions of\r\nthe act of March 1, 1889, has been completed, and the result will be at\r\nonce officially communicated to Congress. The completion of this decennial\r\nenumeration devolves upon Congress the duty of making a new apportionment\r\nof Representatives \"among the several States according to their respective\r\nnumbers.\"\r\n\r\nAt the last session I had occasion to return with my objections several\r\nbills making provisions for the erection of public buildings for the reason\r\nthat the expenditures contemplated were, in my opinion, greatly in excess\r\nof any public need. No class of legislation is more liable to abuse or to\r\ndegenerate into an unseemly scramble about the public Treasury than this.\r\nThere should be exercised in this matter a wise economy, based upon some\r\nresponsible and impartial examination and report as to each case, under a\r\ngeneral law.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of Agriculture deserves especial attention in\r\nview of the fact that the year has been marked in a very unusual degree by\r\nagitation and organization among the farmers looking to an increase in the\r\nprofits of their business. It will be found that the efforts of the\r\nDepartment have been intelligently and zealously devoted to the promotion\r\nof the interests intrusted to its care.\r\n\r\nA very substantial improvement in the market prices of the leading farm\r\nproducts during the year is noticed. The price of wheat advanced from 81\r\ncents in October, 1889, to $1.00 3/4 in October, 1890; corn from 31 cents\r\nto 50 1/4 cents; oats from 19 1/4 cents to 43 cents, and barley from 63\r\ncents to 78 cents. Meats showed a substantial but not so large an increase.\r\nThe export trade in live animals and fowls shows a very large increase. The\r\ntotal value of such exports for the year ending June 30, 1890, was\r\n$33,000,000, and the increase over the preceding year was over $15,000,000.\r\nNearly 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more hogs were exported than in\r\nthe preceding year. The export trade in beef and pork products and in dairy\r\nproducts was very largely increased, the increase in the article of butter\r\nalone being from 15,504,978 pounds to 29,748,042 pounds, and the total\r\nincrease in the value of meat and dairy products exported being\r\n$34,000,000. This trade, so directly helpful to the farmer, it is believed,\r\nwill be yet further and very largely increased when the system of\r\ninspection and sanitary supervision now provided by law is brought fully\r\ninto operation.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Secretary to establish the healthfulness of our meats\r\nagainst the disparaging imputations that have been put upon them abroad\r\nhave resulted in substantial progress. Veterinary surgeons sent out by the\r\nDepartment are now allowed to participate in the inspection of the live\r\ncattle from this country landed at the English docks, and during the\r\nseveral months they have been on duty no case of contagious\r\npleuro-pneumonia has been reported. This inspection abroad and the domestic\r\ninspection of live animals and pork products provided for by the act of\r\nAugust 30, 1890, will afford as perfect a guaranty for the wholesomeness of\r\nour meats offered for foreign consumption as is anywhere given to any food\r\nproduct, and its nonacceptance will quite clearly reveal the real motive of\r\nany continued restriction of their use, and that having been made clear the\r\nduty of the Executive will be very plain.\r\n\r\nThe information given by the Secretary of the progress and prospects of the\r\nbeet-sugar industry is full of interest. It has already passed the\r\nexperimental stage and is a commercial success. The area over which the\r\nsugar beet can be successfully cultivated is very large, and another field\r\ncrop of great value is offered to the choice of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury concurs in the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture that the official supervision provided by the\r\ntariff law for sugar of domestic production shall be transferred to the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe law relating to the civil service has, so far as I can learn, been\r\nexecuted by those having the power of appointment in the classified service\r\nwith fidelity and impartiality, and the service has been increasingly\r\nsatisfactory. The report of the Commission shows a large amount of good\r\nwork done during the year with very limited appropriations.\r\n\r\nI congratulate the Congress and the country upon the passage at the first\r\nsession of the Fifty-first Congress of an unusual number of laws of very\r\nhigh importance. That the results of this legislation will be the\r\nquickening and enlargement of our manufacturing industries, larger and\r\nbetter markets for our breadstuffs and provisions both at home and abroad,\r\nmore constant employment and better wages for our working people, and an\r\nincreased supply of a safe currency for the transaction of business, I do\r\nnot doubt. Some of these measures were enacted at so late a period that the\r\nbeneficial effects upon commerce which were in the contemplation of\r\nCongress have as yet but partially manifested themselves.\r\n\r\nThe general trade and industrial conditions throughout the country during\r\nthe year have shown a marked improvement. For many years prior to 1888 the\r\nmerchandise balances of foreign trade had been largely in our favor, but\r\nduring that year and the year following they turned against us. It is very\r\ngratifying to know that the last fiscal year again shows a balance in our\r\nfavor of over $68,000,000. The bank clearings, which furnish a good test of\r\nthe volume of business transacted, for the first ten months of the year\r\n1890 show as compared with the same months of 1889 an increase for the\r\nwhole country of about 8.4 per cent, while the increase outside of the city\r\nof New York was over 13 per cent. During the month of October the clearings\r\nof the whole country showed an increase of 3.1 per cent over October, 1889,\r\nwhile outside of New York the increase was 11.5 per cent. These figures\r\nshow that the increase in the volume of business was very general\r\nthroughout the country. That this larger business was being conducted upon\r\na safe and profitable basis is shown by the fact that there were 300 less\r\nfailures reported in October, 1890, than in the same month of the preceding\r\nyear, with liabilities diminished by about $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe value of our exports of domestic merchandise during the last year was\r\nover $115,000,000 greater than the preceding year, and was only exceeded\r\nonce in our history. About $100,000,000 of this excess was in agricultural\r\nproducts. The production of pig iron, always a good gauge of general\r\nprosperity, is shown by a recent census bulletin to have been 153 per cent\r\ngreater in 1890 than in 1880, and the production of steel 290 per cent\r\ngreater. Mining in coal has had no limitation except that resulting from\r\ndeficient transportation. The general testimony is that labor is everywhere\r\nfully employed, and the reports for the last year show a smaller number of\r\nemployees affected by strikes and lockouts than in any year since 1884. The\r\ndepression in the prices of agricultural products had been greatly relieved\r\nand a buoyant and hopeful tone was beginning to be felt by all our people.\r\n\r\nThese promising influences have been in some degree checked by the\r\nsurprising and very unfavorable monetary events which have recently taken\r\nplace in England. It is gratifying to know that these did not grow in any\r\ndegree out of the financial relations of London with our people or out of\r\nany discredit attached to our securities held in that market. The return of\r\nour bonds and stocks was caused by a money stringency in England, not by\r\nany loss of value or credit in the securities themselves. We could not,\r\nhowever, wholly escape the ill effects of a foreign monetary agitation\r\naccompanied by such extraordinary incidents as characterized this. It is\r\nnot believed, however, that these evil incidents, which have for the time\r\nunfavorably affected values in this country, can long withstand the strong,\r\nsafe, and wholesome influences which are operating to give to our people\r\nprofitable returns in all branches of legitimate trade and industry. The\r\napprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subjected to\r\nimportant general changes would undoubtedly add a depressing influence of\r\nthe most serious character.\r\n\r\nThe general tariff act has only partially gone into operation, some of its\r\nimportant provisions being limited to take effect at dates yet in the\r\nfuture. The general provisions of the law have been in force less than\r\nsixty days. Its permanent effects upon trade and prices still largely stand\r\nin conjecture. It is curious to note that the advance in the prices of\r\narticles wholly unaffected by the tariff act was by many hastily ascribed\r\nto that act. Notice was not taken of the fact that the general tendency of\r\nthe markets was upward, from influences wholly apart from the recent tariff\r\nlegislation. The enlargement of our currency by the silver bill undoubtedly\r\ngave an upward tendency to trade and had a marked effect on prices; but\r\nthis natural and desired effect of the silver legislation was by many\r\nerroneously attributed to the tariff act.\r\n\r\nThere is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject of\r\ntariff revision shall be again opened before this law has had a fair trial.\r\nIt is quite true that every tariff schedule is subject to objections. No\r\nbill was ever framed, I suppose, that in all of its rates and\r\nclassifications had the full approval even of a party caucus. Such\r\nlegislation is always and necessarily the product of compromise as to\r\ndetails, and the present law is no exception. But in its general scope and\r\neffect I think it will justify the support of those who believe that\r\nAmerican legislation should conserve and defend American trade and the\r\nwages of American workmen.\r\n\r\nThe misinformation as to the terms of the act which has been so widely\r\ndisseminated at home and abroad will be corrected by experience, and the\r\nevil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, the\r\nsavings banks, international trade balances, and the general prosperity of\r\nour people. Already we begin to hear from abroad and from our customhouses\r\nthat the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to the act is not\r\njustified. The imports at the port of New York for the first three weeks of\r\nNovember were nearly 8 per cent greater than for the same period in 1889\r\nand 29 per cent greater than in the same period of 1888. And so far from\r\nbeing an act to limit exports, I confidently believe that under it we shall\r\nsecure a larger and more profitable participation in foreign trade than we\r\nhave ever enjoyed, and that we shall recover a proportionate participation\r\nin the ocean carrying trade of the world.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms of the bill that have come to us from foreign sources may\r\nwell be rejected for repugnancy. If these critics really believe that the\r\nadoption by us of a free-trade policy, or of tariff rates having reference\r\nsolely to revenue, would diminish the participation of their own countries\r\nin the commerce of the world, their advocacy and promotion, by speech and\r\nother forms of organized effort, of this movement among our people is a\r\nrare exhibition of unselfishness in trade. And, on the other hand, if they\r\nsincerely believe that the adoption of a protective-tariff policy by this\r\ncountry inures to their profit and our hurt, it is noticeably strange that\r\nthey should lead the outcry against the authors of a policy so helpful to\r\ntheir countrymen and crown with their favor those who would snatch from\r\nthem a substantial share of a trade with other lands already inadequate to\r\ntheir necessities.\r\n\r\nThere is no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory or\r\nretaliatory legislation. Our policies are adopted not to the hurt of\r\nothers, but to secure for ourselves those advantages that fairly grow out\r\nof our favored position as a nation. Our form of government, with its\r\nincident of universal suffrage, makes it imperative that we shall save our\r\nworking people from the agitations and distresses which scant work and\r\nwages that have no margin for comfort always beget. But after all this is\r\ndone it will be found that our markets are open to friendly commercial\r\nexchanges of enormous value to the other great powers.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of my induction into office the duty of using every power and\r\ninfluence given by law to the executive department for the development of\r\nlarger markets for our products, especially our farm products, has been\r\nkept constantly in mind, and no effort has been or will be spared to\r\npromote that end. We are under no disadvantage in any foreign market,\r\nexcept that we pay our workmen and workwomen better wages than are paid\r\nelsewhere--better abstractly, better relatively to the cost of the\r\nnecessaries of life. I do not doubt that a very largely increased foreign\r\ntrade is accessible to us without bartering for it either our home market\r\nfor such products of the farm and shop as our own people can supply or the\r\nwages of our working people.\r\n\r\nIn many of the products of wood and iron and in meats and breadstuffs we\r\nhave advantages that only need better facilities of intercourse and\r\ntransportation to secure for them large foreign markets. The reciprocity\r\nclause of the tariff act wisely and effectively opens the way to secure a\r\nlarge reciprocal trade in exchange for the free admission to our ports of\r\ncertain products. The right of independent nations to make special\r\nreciprocal trade concessions is well established, and does not impair\r\neither the comity due to other powers or what is known as the\r\n\"favored-nation clause,\" so generally found in commercial treaties. What is\r\ngiven to one for an adequate agreed consideration can not be claimed by\r\nanother freely. The state of the revenues was such that we could dispense\r\nwith any import duties upon coffee, tea, hides, and the lower grades of\r\nsugar and molasses. That the large advantage resulting to the countries\r\nproducing and exporting these articles by placing them on the free list\r\nentitled us to expect a fair return in the way of customs concessions upon\r\narticles exported by us to them was so obvious that to have gratuitously\r\nabandoned this opportunity to enlarge our trade would have been an\r\nunpardonable error.\r\n\r\nThere were but two methods of maintaining control of this question open to\r\nCongress--to place all of these articles upon the dutiable list, subject to\r\nsuch treaty agreements as could be secured, or to place them all presently\r\nupon the free list, but subject to the reimposition of specified duties if\r\nthe countries from which we received them should refuse to give to us\r\nsuitable reciprocal benefits. This latter method, I think, possesses great\r\nadvantages. It expresses in advance the consent of Congress to reciprocity\r\narrangements affecting these products, which must otherwise have been\r\ndelayed and unascertained until each treaty was ratified by the Senate and\r\nthe necessary legislation enacted by Congress. Experience has shown that\r\nsome treaties looking to reciprocal trade have failed to secure a\r\ntwo-thirds vote in the Senate for ratification, and others having passed\r\nthat stage have for years awaited the concurrence of the House and Senate\r\nin such modifications of our revenue laws as were necessary to give effect\r\nto their provisions. We now have the concurrence of both Houses in advance\r\nin a distinct and definite offer of free entry to our ports of specific\r\narticles. The Executive is not required to deal in conjecture as to what\r\nCongress will accept. Indeed, this reciprocity provision is more than an\r\noffer. Our part of the bargain is complete; delivery has been made; and\r\nwhen the countries from which we receive sugar, coffee, tea, and hides have\r\nplaced on their free lists such of our products as shall be agreed upon as\r\nan equivalent for our concession, a proclamation of that fact completes the\r\ntransaction; and in the meantime our own people have free sugar, tea,\r\ncoffee, and hides.\r\n\r\nThe indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and favorable\r\naction by the countries from which we receive our large imports of coffee\r\nand sugar, and it is confidently believed that if steam communication with\r\nthese countries can be promptly improved and enlarged the next year will\r\nshow a most gratifying increase in our exports of breadstuffs and\r\nprovisions, as well as of some important lines of manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the important bills that became laws before the adjournment\r\nof the last session, some other bills of the highest importance were well\r\nadvanced toward a final vote and now stand upon the calendars of the two\r\nHouses in favored positions. The present session has a fixed limit, and if\r\nthese measures are not now brought to a final vote all the work that has\r\nbeen done upon them by this Congress is lost. The proper consideration of\r\nthese, of an apportionment bill, and of the annual appropriation bills will\r\nrequire not only that no working day of the session shall be lost, but that\r\nmeasures of minor and local interest shall not be allowed to interrupt or\r\nretard the progress of those that are of universal interest. In view of\r\nthese conditions, I refrain from bringing before you at this time some\r\nsuggestions that would otherwise be made, and most earnestly invoke your\r\nattention to the duty of perfecting the important legislation now well\r\nadvanced. To some of these measures, which seem to me most important, I now\r\nbriefly call your attention.\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat with added urgency the recommendations contained in my\r\nlast annual message in relation to the development of American steamship\r\nlines. The reciprocity clause of the tariff bill will be largely limited\r\nand its benefits retarded and diminished if provision is not\r\ncontemporaneously made to encourage the establishment of first-class steam\r\ncommunication between our ports and the ports of such nations as may meet\r\nour overtures for enlarged commercial exchanges. The steamship, carrying\r\nthe mails statedly and frequently and offering to passengers a comfortable,\r\nsafe, and speedy transit, is the first condition of foreign trade. It\r\ncarries the order or the buyer, but not all that is ordered or bought. It\r\ngives to the sailing vessels such cargoes as are not urgent or perishable,\r\nand, indirectly at least, promotes that important adjunct of commerce.\r\nThere is now both in this country and in the nations of Central and South\r\nAmerica a state of expectation and confidence as to increased trade that\r\nwill give a double value to your prompt action upon this question.\r\n\r\nThe present situation of our mail communication with Australia illustrates\r\nthe importance of early action by Congress. The Oceanic Steamship Company\r\nmaintains a line of steamers between San Francisco, Sydney, and Auckland\r\nconsisting of three vessels, two of which are of United States registry and\r\none of foreign registry. For the service done by this line in carrying the\r\nmails we pay annually the sum of $46,000, being, as estimated, the full sea\r\nand United States inland postage, which is the limit fixed by law. The\r\ncolonies of New South Wales and New Zealand have been paying annually to\r\nthese lines lbs. 37,000 for carrying the mails from Sydney and Auckland to\r\nSan Francisco. The contract under which this payment has been made is now\r\nabout to expire, and those colonies have refused to renew the contract\r\nunless the United States shall pay a more equitable proportion of the whole\r\nsum necessary to maintain the service.\r\n\r\nI am advised by the Postmaster-General that the United States receives for\r\ncarrying the Australian mails, brought to San Francisco in these steamers,\r\nby rail to Vancouver, an estimated annual income of $75,000, while, as I\r\nhave stated, we are paying out for the support of the steamship line that\r\nbrings this mail to us only $46,000, leaving an annual surplus resulting\r\nfrom this service of $29,000. The trade of the United States with\r\nAustralia, which is in a considerable part carried by these steamers, and\r\nthe whole of which is practically dependent upon the mail communication\r\nwhich they maintain, is largely in our favor. Our total exports of\r\nmerchandise to Australasian ports during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1890, were $11,266,484, while the total imports of merchandise from these\r\nports were only $4,277,676. If we are not willing to see this important\r\nsteamship line withdrawn, or continued with Vancouver substituted for San\r\nFrancisco as the American terminal, Congress should put it in the power of\r\nthe Postmaster-General to make a liberal increase in the amount now paid\r\nfor the transportation of this important mail.\r\n\r\nThe South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a very favored position toward the\r\nnew and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the tariff act\r\nand the postal shipping bill are designed to promote. Steamship lines from\r\nthese ports to some northern port of South America will almost certainly\r\neffect a connection between the railroad systems of the continents long\r\nbefore any continuous line of railroads can be put into operation. The very\r\nlarge appropriation made at the last session for the harbor of Galveston\r\nwas justified, as it seemed to me, by these considerations. The great\r\nNorthwest will feel the advantage of trunk lines to the South as well as to\r\nthe East and of the new markets opened for their surplus food products and\r\nfor many of their manufactured products.\r\n\r\nI had occasion in May last to transmit to Congress a report adopted by the\r\nInternational American Conference upon the subject of the incorporation of\r\nan international American bank, with a view to facilitating money exchanges\r\nbetween the States represented in that conference. Such an institution\r\nwould greatly promote the trade we are seeking to develop. I renew the\r\nrecommendation that a careful and well-guarded charter be granted. I do not\r\nthink the powers granted should include those ordinarily exercised by\r\ntrust, guaranty, and safe-deposit companies, or that more branches in the\r\nUnited States should be authorized than are strictly necessary to\r\naccomplish the object primarily in view, namely, convenient foreign\r\nexchanges. It is quite important that prompt action should be taken in this\r\nmatter, in order that any appropriations for better communication with\r\nthese countries and any agreements that may be made for reciprocal trade\r\nmay not be hindered by the inconvenience of making exchanges through\r\nEuropean money centers or burdened by the tribute which is an incident of\r\nthat method of business.\r\n\r\nThe bill for the relief of the Supreme Court has after many years of\r\ndiscussion reached a position where final action is easily attainable, and\r\nit is hoped that any differences of opinion may be so harmonized as to save\r\nthe essential features of this very important measure. In this connection I\r\nearnestly renew my recommendation that the salaries of the judges of the\r\nUnited States district courts be so readjusted that none of them shall\r\nreceive less than $5,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and the\r\nurgent necessity for providing some commission or tribunal for the trial of\r\nquestions of title growing out of them were twice brought by me to the\r\nattention of Congress at the last session. Bills have been reported from\r\nthe proper committees in both Houses upon the subject, and I very earnestly\r\nhope that this Congress will put an end to the delay which has attended the\r\nsettlement of the disputes as to the title between the settlers and the\r\nclaimants under these grants. These disputes retard the prosperity and\r\ndisturb the peace of large and important communities. The governor of New\r\nMexico in his last report to the Secretary of the Interior suggests some\r\nmodifications of the provisions of the pending bills relating to the small\r\nholdings of farm lands. I commend to your attention the suggestions of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of a national bankrupt law I still regard as very desirable.\r\nThe Constitution having given to Congress jurisdiction of this subject, it\r\nshould be exercised and uniform rules provided for the administration of\r\nthe affairs of insolvent debtors. The inconveniences resulting from the\r\noccasional and temporary exercise of this power by Congress and from the\r\nconflicting State codes of insolvency which come into force intermediately\r\nshould be removed by the enactment of a simple, inexpensive, and permanent\r\nnational bankrupt law.\r\n\r\nI also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation affording just\r\ncopyright protection to foreign authors on a footing of reciprocal\r\nadvantage for our authors abroad.\r\n\r\nIt may still be possible for this Congress to inaugurate by suitable\r\nlegislation a movement looking to uniformity and increased safety in the\r\nuse of couplers and brakes upon freight trains engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce. The chief difficulty in the way is to secure agreement as to the\r\nbest appliances, simplicity, effectiveness, and cost being considered. This\r\ndifficulty will only yield to legislation, which should be based upon full\r\ninquiry and impartial tests. The purpose should be to secure the\r\ncooperation of all well-disposed managers and owners; but the fearful fact\r\nthat every year's delay involves the sacrifice of 2,000 lives and the\r\nmaiming of 20,000 young men should plead both with Congress and the\r\nmanagers against any needless delay.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the conservation and equal distribution of the water supply\r\nof the arid regions has had much attention from Congress, but has not as\r\nyet been put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis. The urgency of the\r\nsubject does not grow out of any large present demand for the use of these\r\nlands for agriculture, but out of the danger that the water supply and the\r\nsites for the necessary catch basins may fall into the hands of individuals\r\nor private corporations and be used to render subservient the large areas\r\ndependent upon such supply. The owner of the water is the owner of the\r\nlands, however the titles may run. All unappropriated natural water sources\r\nand all necessary reservoir sites should be held by the Government for the\r\nequal use at fair rates of the homestead settlers who will eventually take\r\nup these lands. The United States should not, in my opinion, undertake the\r\nconstruction of dams or canals, but should limit its work to such surveys\r\nand observations as will determine the water supply, both surface and\r\nsubterranean, the areas capable of irrigation, and the location and storage\r\ncapacity of reservoirs. This done, the use of the water and of the\r\nreservoir sites might be granted to the respective States or Territories or\r\nto individuals or associations upon the condition that the necessary works\r\nshould be constructed and the water furnished at fair rates without\r\ndiscrimination, the rates to be subject to supervision by the legislatures\r\nor by boards of water commissioners duly constituted. The essential thing\r\nto be secured is the common and equal use at fair rates of the accumulated\r\nwater supply. It were almost better that these lands should remain arid\r\nthan that those who occupy them should become the slaves of unrestrained\r\nmonopolies controlling the one essential element of land values and crop\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe use of the telegraph by the Post-Office Department as a means for the\r\nrapid transmission of written communications is, I believe, upon proper\r\nterms, quite desirable. The Government does not own or operate the\r\nrailroads, and it should not, I think, own or operate the telegraph lines.\r\nIt does, however, seem to be quite practicable for the Government to\r\ncontract with the telegraph companies, as it does with railroad companies,\r\nto carry at specified rates such communications as the senders may\r\ndesignate for this method of transmission. I recommend that such\r\nlegislation be enacted as will enable the Post-Office Department fairly to\r\ntest by experiment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph.\r\n\r\nIf any intelligent and loyal company of American citizens were required to\r\ncatalogue the essential human conditions of national life, I do not doubt\r\nthat with absolute unanimity they would begin with \"free and honest\r\nelections.\" And it is gratifying to know that generally there is a growing\r\nand nonpartisan demand for better election laws; but against this sign of\r\nhope and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable fact that\r\nelection laws and methods are sometimes cunningly contrived to secure\r\nminority control, while violence completes the shortcomings of fraud.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I suggested that the development of the existing\r\nlaw providing a Federal supervision of Congressional elections offered an\r\neffective method of reforming these abuses. The need of such a law has\r\nmanifested itself in many parts of the country, and its wholesome\r\nrestraints and penalties will be useful in all. The constitutionality of\r\nsuch legislation has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its probable\r\neffectiveness is evidenced by the character of the opposition that is made\r\nto it. It has been denounced as if it were a new exercise of Federal power\r\nand an invasion of the rights of States. Nothing could be further from the\r\ntruth. Congress has already fixed the time for the election of members of\r\nCongress. It has declared that votes for members of Congress must be by\r\nwritten or printed ballot; it has provided for the appointment by the\r\ncircuit courts in certain cases, and upon the petition of a certain number\r\nof citizens, of election supervisors, and made it their duty to supervise\r\nthe registration of voters conducted by the State officers; to challenge\r\npersons offering to register; to personally inspect and scrutinize the\r\nregistry lists, and to affix their names to the lists for the purpose of\r\nidentification and the prevention of frauds; to attend at elections and\r\nremain with the boxes till they are all cast and counted; to attach to the\r\nregistry lists and election returns any statement touching the accuracy and\r\nfairness of the registry and election, and to take and transmit to the\r\nClerk of the House of Representatives any evidence of fraudulent practices\r\nwhich may be presented to them. The same law provides for the appointment\r\nof deputy United States marshals to attend at the polls, support the\r\nsupervisors in the discharge of their duties, and to arrest persons\r\nviolating the election laws. The provisions of this familiar title of the\r\nRevised Statutes have been put into exercise by both the great political\r\nparties, and in the North as well as in the South, by the filing with the\r\ncourt of the petitions required by the law.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, a question whether we shall have a Federal election\r\nlaw, for we now have one and have had for nearly twenty years, but whether\r\nwe shall have an effective law. The present law stops just short of\r\neffectiveness, for it surrenders to the local authorities all control over\r\nthe certification which establishes the prima facie right to a seat in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. This defect should be cured. Equality of\r\nrepresentation and the parity of the electors must be maintained or\r\neverything that is valuable in our system of government is lost. The\r\nqualifications of an elector must be sought in the law, net in the\r\nopinions, prejudices, or fears of any class, however powerful. The path of\r\nthe elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush of fear and the\r\nenticements of fraud; the count so true and open that none shall gainsay\r\nit. Such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and impartial. It should\r\ngive the advantage to honesty and the control to majorities. Surely there\r\nis nothing sectional about this creed, and if it shall happen that the\r\npenalties of laws intended to enforce these rights fall here and not there\r\nit is not because the law is sectional, but because, happily, crime is\r\nlocal and not universal. Nor should it be forgotten that every law, whether\r\nrelating to elections or to any other subject, whether enacted by the State\r\nor by the nation, has force behind it; the courts, the marshal or\r\nconstable, the posse comitatus, the prison, are all and always behind the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nOne can not be justly charged with unfriendliness to any section or class\r\nwho seeks only to restrain violations of law and of personal right. No\r\ncommunity will find lawlessness profitable. No community can afford to have\r\nit known that the officers who are charged with the preservation of the\r\npublic peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves the\r\nproduct of fraud or violence. The magistrate is then without respect and\r\nthe law without sanction. The floods of lawlessness can not be leveed and\r\nmade to run in one channel. The killing of a United States marshal carrying\r\na writ of arrest for an election offense is full of prompting and\r\nsuggestion to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against\r\nlife or property.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and some\r\nhave even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made\r\nimpossible they may be supplanted by intimidation and violence. If the\r\nproposed law gives to any qualified elector by a hair's weight more than\r\nhis equal influence or detracts by so much from any other qualified\r\nelector, it is fatally impeached. But if the law is equal and the\r\nanimosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors have\r\nbeen accustomed to exercise the franchise for others as well as for\r\nthemselves, then these animosities ought not to be confessed without shame,\r\nand can not be given any weight in the discussion without dishonor No\r\nchoice is left to me but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secure\r\nto the citizen his constitutional rights and to recommend that the\r\ninadequacies of such laws be promptly remedied. If to promote with zeal and\r\nready interest every project for the development of its material interests,\r\nits rivers, harbors, mines, and factories, and the intelligence, peace, and\r\nsecurity under the law of its communities and its homes is not accepted as\r\nsufficient evidence of friendliness to any State or section, I can not add\r\nconnivance at election practices that not only disturb local results, but\r\nrob the electors of other States and sections of their most priceless\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the general appropriation bills should be conducted with\r\nthe greatest care and the closest scrutiny of expenditures. Appropriations\r\nshould be adequate to the needs of the public service, but they should be\r\nabsolutely free from prodigality.\r\n\r\nI venture again to remind you that the brief time remaining for the\r\nconsideration of the important legislation now awaiting your attention\r\noffers no margin for waste. If the present duty is discharged with\r\ndiligence, fidelity, and courage, the work of the Fifty-first Congress may\r\nbe confidently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nBenjamin Harrison\r\nDecember 9, 1891\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments required by\r\nlaw to be submitted to me, which are herewith transmitted, and the reports\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney-General, made directly to\r\nCongress, furnish a comprehensive view of the administrative work of the\r\nlast fiscal year relating to internal affair. It would be of great\r\nadvantage if these reports could have an alternative perusal by every\r\nmember of Congress and by all who take an interest in public affairs. Such\r\na perusal could not fail to excite a higher appreciation of the vast labor\r\nand conscientious effort which are given to the conduct of our civil\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe reports will, I believe, show that every question has been approached,\r\nconsidered, and decided from the standpoint of public duty upon\r\nconsiderations affecting the public interests alone. Again I invite to\r\nevery branch of the service the attention and scrutiny of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe work of the State Department during the last year has been\r\ncharacterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and by\r\ndiplomatic results of a notable and highly beneficial character. Among\r\nthese are the reciprocal trade arrangements which have been concluded, in\r\nthe exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the tariff law, with\r\nthe Republic of Brazil, with Spain for its West India possessions, and with\r\nSanto Domingo. Like negotiations with other countries have been much\r\nadvanced, and it is hoped that before the close of the year further\r\ndefinitive trade arrangements of great value will be concluded.\r\n\r\nIn view of the reports which had been received as to the diminution of the\r\nseal herds in the Bering Sea, I deemed it wise to propose to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment in February last that an agreement for a closed season should be\r\nmade pending the negotiations for arbitration, which then seemed to be\r\napproaching a favorable conclusion. After much correspondence and delays,\r\nfor which this Government was not responsible, an agreement was reached and\r\nsigned on the 15th of June, by which Great Britain undertook from that date\r\nand until May 1, 1892, to prohibit the killing by her subjects of seals in\r\nthe Bering Sea, and the Government of the United States during the same\r\nperiod to enforce its existing prohibition against pelagic sealing and to\r\nlimit the catch by the fur-seal company upon the islands to 7,500 skins. If\r\nthis agreement could have been reached earlier in response to the strenuous\r\nendeavors of this Government, it would have been more effective; but coming\r\neven as late as it did it unquestionably resulted in greatly diminishing\r\nthe destruction of the seals by the Canadian sealers.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I stated that the basis of arbitration proposed\r\nby Her Majesty's Government for the adjustment of the long-pending\r\ncontroversy as to the seal fisheries was not acceptable. I am glad now to\r\nbe able to announce that terms satisfactory to this Government have been\r\nagreed upon and that an agreement as to the arbitrators is all that is\r\nnecessary to the completion of the convention. In view of the advanced\r\nposition which this Government has taken upon the subject of international\r\narbitration, this renewed expression of our adherence to this method for\r\nthe settlement of disputes such as have arisen in the Bering Sea will, I\r\ndoubt not, meet with the concurrence of Congress.\r\n\r\nProvision should be made for a joint demarcation of the frontier line\r\nbetween Canada and the United States wherever required by the increasing\r\nborder settlements, and especially for the exact location of the water\r\nboundary in the straits and rivers.\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to announce some favorable disposition of the\r\nboundary dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela touching the western\r\nfrontier of British Guiana, but the friendly efforts of the United States\r\nin that direction have thus far been unavailing. This Government will\r\ncontinue to express its concern at any appearance of foreign encroachment\r\non territories long under the administrative control of American States.\r\nThe determination of a disputed boundary is easily attainable by amicable\r\narbitration where the rights of the respective parties rest, as here, on\r\nhistoric facts readily ascertainable.\r\n\r\nThe law of the last Congress providing a system of inspection for our meats\r\nintended for export, and clothing the President with power to exclude\r\nforeign products from our market in case the country sending them should\r\nperpetuate unjust discriminations against any product of the United States,\r\nplaced this Government in a position to effectively urge the removal of\r\nsuch discriminations against our meats. It is gratifying to be able to\r\nstate that Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria, and France, in the order\r\nnamed, have opened their ports to inspected American pork products. The\r\nremoval of these restrictions in every instance was asked for and given\r\nsolely upon the ground that we have now provided a meat inspection that\r\nshould be accepted as adequate to the complete removal of the dangers, real\r\nor fancied, which had been previously urged. The State Department, our\r\nministers abroad, and the Secretary of Agriculture have cooperated with\r\nunflagging and intelligent zeal for the accomplishment of this great\r\nresult. The outlines of an agreement have been reached with Germany looking\r\nto equitable trade concessions in consideration of the continued free\r\nimportation of her sugars, but the time has not yet arrived when this\r\ncorrespondence can be submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe recent political disturbances in the Republic of Brazil have excited\r\nregret and solicitude. The information we possessed was too meager to\r\nenable us to form a satisfactory judgment of the causes leading to the\r\ntemporary assumption of supreme power by President Fonseca; but this\r\nGovernment did not fail to express to him its anxious solicitude for the\r\npeace of Brazil and for the maintenance of the free political institutions\r\nwhich had recently been established there, nor to offer our advice that\r\ngreat moderation should be observed in the clash of parties and the contest\r\nfor leadership. These counsels were received in the most friendly spirit,\r\nand the latest information is that constitutional government has been\r\nreestablished without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe lynching at New Orleans in March last of eleven men of Italian nativity\r\nby a mob of citizens was a most deplorable and discreditable incident. It\r\ndid not, however, have its origin in any general animosity to the Italian\r\npeople, nor in any disrespect to the Government of Italy, with which our\r\nrelations were of the most friendly character. The fury of the mob was\r\ndirected against these men as the supposed participants or accessories in\r\nthe murder of a city officer. I do not allude to this as mitigating in any\r\ndegree this offense against law and humanity, but only as affecting the\r\ninternational questions which grew out of it. It was at once represented by\r\nthe Italian minister that several of those whose lives had been taken by\r\nthe mob were Italian subjects, and a demand was made for the punishment of\r\nthe participants and for an indemnity to the families of those who were\r\nkilled. It is to be regretted that the manner in which these claims were\r\npresented was not such as to promote a calm discussion of the questions\r\ninvolved; but this may well be attributed to the excitement and indignation\r\nwhich the crime naturally evoked. The views of this Government as to its\r\nobligations to foreigners domiciled here were fully stated in the\r\ncorrespondence, as well as its purpose to make an investigation of the\r\naffair with a view to determine whether there were present any\r\ncircumstances that could under such rules of duty as we had indicated\r\ncreate an obligation upon the United States. The temporary absence of a\r\nminister plenipotentiary of Italy at this capital has retarded the further\r\ncorrespondence, but it is not doubted that a friendly conclusion is\r\nattainable.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions growing out of this unhappy incident are worthy the\r\nattention of Congress. It would, I believe, be entirely competent for\r\nCongress to make offenses against the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled\r\nin the United States cognizable in the Federal courts. This has not,\r\nhowever, been done, and the Federal officers and courts have no power in\r\nsuch cases to intervene, either for the protection of a foreign citizen or\r\nfor the punishment of his slayers. It seems to me to follow, in this state\r\nof the law, that the officers of the State charged with police and judicial\r\npowers in such cases must in the consideration of international questions\r\ngrowing out of such incidents be regarded in such sense as Federal agents\r\nas to make this Government answerable for their acts in cases where it\r\nwould be answerable if the United States had used its constitutional power\r\nto define and punish crime against treaty rights.\r\n\r\nThe civil war in Chile, which began in January last, was continued, but\r\nfortunately with infrequent and not important armed collisions, until\r\nAugust 28, when the Congressional forces landed near Valparaiso and after a\r\nbloody engagement captured that city. President Balmaceda at once\r\nrecognized that his cause was lost, and a Provisional Government was\r\nspeedily established by the victorious party. Our minister was promptly\r\ndirected to recognize and put himself in communication with this Government\r\nso soon as it should have established its de facto character, which was\r\ndone. During the pendency of this civil contest frequent indirect appeals\r\nwere made to this Government to extend belligerent rights to the insurgents\r\nand to give audience to their representatives. This was declined, and that\r\npolicy was pursued throughout which this Government when wrenched by civil\r\nwar so strenuously insisted upon on the part of European nations. The\r\nItata, an armed vessel commanded by a naval officer of the insurgent fleet,\r\nmanned by its sailors and with soldiers on board, was seized under process\r\nof the United States court at San Diego, Cal., for a violation of our\r\nneutrality laws. While in the custody of an officer of the court the vessel\r\nwas forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It would have been\r\ninconsistent with the dignity and self-respect of this Government not to\r\nhave insisted that the Itala should be returned to San Diego to abide the\r\njudgment of the court. This was so clear to the junta of the Congressional\r\nparty, established at Iquique, that before the arrival of the Itata at that\r\nport the secretary of foreign relations of the Provisional Government\r\naddressed to Rear-Admiral Brown, commanding the United States naval forces,\r\na communication, from which the following is an extract: The Provisional\r\nGovernment has learned by the cablegrams of the Associated Press that the\r\ntransport Itata, detained in San Diego by order of the United States for\r\ntaking on board munitions of war, and in possession of the marshal, left\r\nthe port, carrying on board this official, who was landed at a point near\r\nthe coast, and then continued her voyage. If this news be correct this\r\nGovernment would deplore the conduct of the Itata, and as an evidence that\r\nit is not disposed to support or agree to the infraction of the laws of the\r\nUnited States the undersigned takes advantage of the personal relations you\r\nhave been good enough to maintain with him since your arrival in this port\r\nto declare to you that as soon as she is within reach of our orders his\r\nGovernment will put the Itata, with the arms and munitions she took on\r\nboard in Sail Diego, at the disposition of the United States. A trial in\r\nthe district court of the United States for the southern district of\r\nCalifornia has recently resulted in a decision holding, among other things,\r\nthat inasmuch as the Congressional party had not been recognized as a\r\nbelligerent the acts done in its interest could not be a violation of our\r\nneutrality laws. From this judgment the United States has appealed, not\r\nthat the condemnation of the vessel is a matter of importance, but that we\r\nmay know what the present state of our law is; for if this construction of\r\nthe statute is correct there is obvious necessity for revision and\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the war in Chile this Government tendered its good\r\noffices to bring about a peaceful adjustment, and it was at one time hoped\r\nthat a good result might be reached; but in this we were disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to our naval officers and to our minister at Santiago from\r\nthe first to the last of this struggle enjoined upon them the most\r\nimpartial treatment and absolute noninterference. I am satisfied that these\r\ninstructions were observed and that our representatives were always\r\nwatchful to use their influence impartially in the interest of humanity,\r\nand on more than one occasion did so effectively. We could not forget,\r\nhowever, that this Government was in diplomatic relations with the then\r\nestablished Government of Chile, as it is now in such relations with the\r\nsuccessor of that Government. I am quite sure that President Montt, who\r\nhas, under circumstances of promise for the peace of Chile, been installed\r\nas President of that Republic, will not desire that in the unfortunate\r\nevent of any revolt against his authority the policy of this Government\r\nshould be other than that which we have recently observed. No official\r\ncomplaint of the conduct of our minister or of our naval officers during\r\nthe struggle has been presented to this Government, and it is a matter of\r\nregret that so many of our own people should have given ear to unofficial\r\ncharges and complaints that manifestly had their origin in rival interests\r\nand in a wish to pervert the relations of the United States with Chile.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the Government of Balmaceda brought about a condition which\r\nis unfortunately too familiar in the history of the Central and South\r\nAmerican States. With the overthrow of the Balmaceda Government he and many\r\nof his councilors and officers became at once fugitives for their lives and\r\nappealed to the commanding officers of the foreign naval vessels in the\r\nharbor of Valparaiso and to the resident foreign ministers at Santiago for\r\nasylum. This asylum was freely given, according to my information, by the\r\nnaval vessels of several foreign powers and by several of the legations at\r\nSantiago. The American minister as well as his colleagues, acting upon the\r\nimpulse of humanity, extended asylum to political refugees whose lives were\r\nin peril. I have not been willing to direct the surrender of such of these\r\npersons as are still in the American legation without suitable conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the Government of Chile is not in a position, in view\r\nof the precedents with which it has been connected, to broadly deny the\r\nright of asylum, and the correspondence has not thus far presented any such\r\ndenial. The treatment of our minister for a time was such as to call for a\r\ndecided protest, and it was very gratifying to observe that unfriendly\r\nmeasures, which were undoubtedly the result of the prevailing excitement,\r\nwere at once rescinded or suitably relaxed.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of October an event occurred in Valparaiso so serious and\r\ntragic in its circumstances and results as to very justly excite the\r\nindignation of our people and to call for prompt and decided action on the\r\npart of this Government. A considerable number of the sailors of the United\r\nStates steamship Baltimore, then in the harbor at Valparaiso, being upon\r\nshore leave and unarmed, were assaulted by armed men nearly simultaneously\r\nin different localities in the city. One petty officer was killed outright\r\nand seven or eight seamen were seriously wounded, one of whom has since\r\ndied. So savage and brutal was the assault that several of our sailors\r\nreceived more than two and one as many as eighteen stab wounds. An\r\ninvestigation of the affair was promptly made by a board of officers of the\r\nBaltimore, and their report shows that these assaults were unprovoked, that\r\nour men were conducting themselves in a peaceable and orderly manner, and\r\nthat some of the police of the city took part in the assault and used their\r\nweapons with fatal effect, while a few others, with some well-disposed\r\ncitizens, endeavored to protect our men. Thirty-six of our sailors were\r\narrested, and some of them while being taken to prison were cruelly beaten\r\nand maltreated. The fact that they were all discharged, no criminal charge\r\nbeing lodged against any one of them, shows very clearly that they were\r\ninnocent of any breach of the peace.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have yet been able to learn no other explanation of this bloody\r\nwork has been suggested than that it had its origin in hostility to those\r\nmen as sailors of the United States, wearing the uniform of their\r\nGovernment, and not in any individual act or personal animosity. The\r\nattention of the Chilean Government was at once called to this affair, and\r\na statement of the facts obtained by the investigation we had conducted was\r\nsubmitted, accompanied by a request to be advised of any other or\r\nqualifying facts in the possession of the Chilean Government that might\r\ntend to relieve this affair of the appearance of an insult to this\r\nGovernment. The Chilean Government was also advised that if such qualifying\r\nfacts did not exist this Government would confidently expect full and\r\nprompt reparation.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the reply of the secretary for foreign affairs\r\nof the Provisional Government was couched in an offensive tone. To this no\r\nresponse has been made. This Government is now awaiting the result of an\r\ninvestigation which has been conducted by the criminal court at Valparaiso.\r\nIt is reported unofficially that the investigation is about completed, and\r\nit is expected that the result will soon be communicated to this\r\nGovernment, together with some adequate and satisfactory response to the\r\nnote by which the attention of Chile was called to this incident. If these\r\njust expectations should be disappointed or further needless delay\r\nintervene, I will by a special message bring this matter again to the\r\nattention of Congress for such action as may be necessary. The entire\r\ncorrespondence with the Government of Chile will at an early day be\r\nsubmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation of my special message dated January 16, 1890,\r\nfor the adoption of the necessary legislation to enable this Government to\r\napply in the case of Sweden and Norway the same rule in respect to the\r\nlevying of tonnage dues as was claimed and secured to the shipping of the\r\nUnited States in 1828 under Article VIII of the treaty of 1827.\r\n\r\nThe adjournment of the Senate without action on the pending acts for the\r\nsuppression of the slave traffic in Africa and for the reform of the\r\nrevenue tariff of the Independent State of the Kongo left this Government\r\nunable to exchange those acts on the date fixed, July 2, 1891. A modus\r\nvivendi has been concluded by which the power of the Kongo State to levy\r\nduties on imports is left unimpaired, and by agreement of all the\r\nsignatories to the general slave-trade act the time for the exchange of\r\nratifications on the part of the United States has been extended to\r\nFebruary 2, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe late outbreak against foreigners in various parts of the Chinese Empire\r\nhas been a cause of deep concern in view of the numerous establishments of\r\nour citizens in the interior of that country. This Government can do no\r\nless than insist upon a continuance of the protective and punitory measures\r\nwhich the Chinese Government has heretofore applied. No effort will be\r\nomitted to protect our citizens peaceably sojourning in China, but recent\r\nunofficial information indicates that what was at first regarded as an\r\noutbreak of mob violence against foreigners has assumed the larger form of\r\nan insurrection against public order.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government has declined to receive Mr. Blair as the minister of\r\nthe United States on the ground that as a participant while a Senator in\r\nthe enactment of the existing legislation against the introduction of\r\nChinese laborers he has become unfriendly and objectionable to China. I\r\nhave felt constrained to point out to the Chinese Government the\r\nuntenableness of this position, which seems to rest as much on the\r\nunacceptability of our legislation as on that of the person chosen, and\r\nwhich if admitted would practically debar the selection of any\r\nrepresentative so long as the existing laws remain in force.\r\n\r\nYou will be called upon to consider the expediency of making special\r\nprovision by law for the temporary admission of some Chinese artisans and\r\nlaborers in connection with the exhibit of Chinese industries at the\r\napproaching Columbian Exposition. I regard it as desirable that the Chinese\r\nexhibit be facilitated in every proper way.\r\n\r\nA question has arisen with the Government of Spain touching the rights of\r\nAmerican citizens in the Caroline Islands. Our citizens there long prior to\r\nthe confirmation of Spain's claim to the islands had secured by settlement\r\nand purchase certain rights to the recognition and maintenance of which the\r\nfaith of Spain was pledged. I have had reason within the past year very\r\nstrongly to protest against the failure to carry out this pledge on the\r\npart of His Majesty's ministers, which has resulted in great injustice and\r\ninjury to the American residents.\r\n\r\nThe Government and people of Spain propose to celebrate the four hundredth\r\nanniversary of the discovery of America by holding an exposition at Madrid,\r\nwhich will open on the 12th of September and continue until the 31st of\r\nDecember, 1892. A cordial invitation has been extended to the United States\r\nto take part in this commemoration, and as Spain was one of the first\r\nnations to express the intention to participate in the World's Columbian\r\nExposition at Chicago, it would be very appropriate for this Government to\r\ngive this invitation its friendly promotion.\r\n\r\nSurveys for the connecting links of the projected intercontinental railway\r\nare in progress, not only in Mexico, but at various points along the course\r\nmapped out. Three surveying parties are now in the field under the\r\ndirection of the commission. Nearly 1,000 miles of the proposed road have\r\nbeen surveyed, including the most difficult part, that through Ecuador and\r\nthe southern part of Colombia. The reports of the engineers are very\r\nsatisfactory, and show that no insurmountable obstacles have been met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1884, a treaty was concluded with Mexico reaffirming the\r\nboundary between the two countries as described in the treaties of February\r\n2, 1848, and December 30, 1853. March 1, 1889, a further treaty was\r\nnegotiated to facilitate the carrying out of the principles of the treaty\r\nof 1884 and to avoid the difficulties occasioned by reason of the changes\r\nand alterations that take place from natural causes in the Rio Grande and\r\nColorado rivers in the portions thereof constituting the boundary line\r\nbetween the two Republics. The International Boundary Commission provided\r\nfor by the treaty of 1889 to have exclusive jurisdiction of any question\r\nthat may arise has been named by the Mexican Government. An appropriation\r\nis necessary to enable the United States to fulfill its treaty obligations\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\nThe death of King Kalakaua in the United States afforded occasion to\r\ntestify our friendship for Hawaii by conveying the King's body to his own\r\nland in a naval vessel with all due honors. The Government of his\r\nsuccessor, Queen Liliuokolani is seeking to promote closer commercial\r\nrelations with the United States. Surveys for the much-needed submarine\r\ncable from our Pacific coast to Honolulu are in progress, and this\r\nenterprise should have the suitable promotion of the two Governments. I\r\nstrongly recommend that provision be made for improving the harbor of Pearl\r\nRiver and equipping it as a naval station.\r\n\r\nThe arbitration treaty formulated by the International American Conference\r\nlapsed by reason of the failure to exchange ratifications fully within the\r\nlimit of time provided; but several of the Governments concerned have\r\nexpressed a desire to save this important result of the conference by an\r\nextension of the period. It is, in my judgment, incumbent upon the United\r\nStates to conserve the influential initiative it has taken in this measure\r\nby ratifying the instrument and by advocating the proposed extension of the\r\ntime for exchange. These views have been made known to the other\r\nsignatories.\r\n\r\nThis Government has found occasion to express in a friendly spirit, but\r\nwith much earnestness, to the Government of the Czar its serious concern\r\nbecause of the harsh measures now being enforced against the Hebrews in\r\nRussia. By the revival of antisemitic laws, long in abeyance, great numbers\r\nof those unfortunate people have been constrained to abandon their homes\r\nand leave the Empire by reason of the impossibility of finding subsistence\r\nwithin the pale to which it is sought to confine them. The immigration of\r\nthese people to the United States--many other countries being closed to\r\nthem--is largely increasing and is likely to assume proportions which may\r\nmake it difficult to find homes and employment for them here and to\r\nseriously affect the labor market. It is estimated that over 1,000,000 will\r\nbe forced from Russia within a few years. The Hebrew is never a beggar; he\r\nhas always kept the law--life by toil--often under severe and oppressive\r\ncivil restrictions. It is also true that no race, sect, or class has more\r\nfully cared for its own than the Hebrew race. But the sudden transfer of\r\nsuch a multitude under conditions that tend to strip them of their small\r\naccumulations and to depress their energies and courage is neither good for\r\nthem nor for us.\r\n\r\nThe banishment, whether by direct decree or by not less certain indirect\r\nmethods, of so large a number of men and women is not a local question. A\r\ndecree to leave one country is in the nature of things an order to enter\r\nanother--some other. This consideration, as well as the suggestion of\r\nhumanity, furnishes ample ground for the remonstrances which we have\r\npresented to Russia, while our historic friendship for that Government can\r\nnot fail to give the assurance that our representations are those of a\r\nsincere wellwisher.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua shows that\r\nmuch costly and necessary preparatory work has been done during the year in\r\nthe construction of shops, railroad tracks, and harbor piers and\r\nbreakwaters, and that the work of canal construction has made some\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nI deem it to be a matter of the highest concern to the United States that\r\nthis canal, connecting the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and\r\ngiving to us a short water communication between our ports upon those two\r\ngreat seas, should be speedily constructed and at the smallest practicable\r\nlimit of cost. The gain in freights to the people and the direct saving to\r\nthe Government of the United States in the use of its naval vessels would\r\npay the entire cost of this work within a short series of years. The report\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy shows the saving in our naval expenditures\r\nwhich would result.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Alabama (Mr. Morgan) in his argument upon this subject\r\nbefore the Senate at the last session did not overestimate the importance\r\nof this work when he said that \"the canal is the most important subject now\r\nconnected with the commercial growth and progress of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIf this work is to be promoted by the usual financial methods and without\r\nthe aid of this Government, the expenditures in its interest-bearing\r\nsecurities and stock will probably be twice the actual cost. This will\r\nnecessitate higher tolls and constitute a heavy and altogether needless\r\nburden upon our commerce and that of the world. Every dollar of the bonds\r\nand stock of the company should represent a dollar expended in the\r\nlegitimate and economical prosecution of the work. This is only possible by\r\ngiving to the bonds the guaranty of the United States Government. Such a\r\nguaranty would secure the ready sale at par of a 3 per cent bond from time\r\nto time as the money was needed. I do not doubt that built upon these\r\nbusiness methods the canal would when fully inaugurated earn its fixed\r\ncharges and operating expenses. But if its bonds are to be marketed at\r\nheavy discounts and every bond sold is to be accompanied by a gift of\r\nstock, as has come to be expected by investors in such enterprises, the\r\ntraffic will be seriously burdened to pay interest and dividends. I am\r\nquite willing to recommend Government promotion in the prosecution of a\r\nwork which, if no other means offered for securing its completion, is of\r\nsuch transcendent interest that the Government should, in my opinion,\r\nsecure it by direct appropriations from its Treasury.\r\n\r\nA guaranty of the bonds of the canal company to an amount necessary to the\r\ncompletion of the canal could, I think, be so given as not to involve any\r\nserious risk of ultimate loss. The things to be carefully guarded are the\r\ncompletion of the work within the limits of the guaranty, the subrogation\r\nof the United States to the rights of the first-mortgage bondholders for\r\nany amounts it may have to pay, and in the meantime a control of the stock\r\nof the company as a security against mismanagement and loss. I most\r\nsincerely hope that neither party nor sectional lines will be drawn upon\r\nthis great American project, so full of interest to the people of all our\r\nStates and so influential in its effects upon the prestige and prosperity\r\nof our common country.\r\n\r\nThe island of Navassa, in the West Indian group, has, under the provisions\r\nof Title VII of the Revised Statutes, been recognized by the President as\r\nappertaining to the United States. It contains guano deposits, is owned by\r\nthe Navassa Phosphate Company, and is occupied solely its employees. In\r\nSeptember, 1889, a revolt took place among these laborers, resulting in the\r\nkilling of some of the agents of the company, caused, as the laborers\r\nclaimed, by cruel treatment. These men were arrested and tried in the\r\nUnited States court at Baltimore, under section 5576 of the statute\r\nreferred to, as if the offenses had been committed on board a merchant\r\nvessel of the United States on the high seas. There appeared on the trial\r\nand otherwise came to me such evidences of the bad treatment of the men\r\nthat in consideration of this and of the fact that the men had no access to\r\nany public officer or tribunal for protection or the redress of their\r\nwrongs I commuted the death sentences that had been passed by the court\r\nupon three of them. In April last my attention was again called to this\r\nisland and to the unregulated condition of things there by a letter from a\r\ncolored laborer, who complained that he was wrongfully detained upon the\r\nisland by the phosphate company after the expiration of his contract of\r\nservice. A naval vessel was sent to examine into the case of this man and\r\ngenerally into the condition of things on the island. It was found that the\r\nlaborer referred to had been detained beyond the contract limit and that a\r\ncondition of revolt again existed among the laborers. A board of naval\r\nofficers reported, among other things, as follows: We would desire to state\r\nfurther that the discipline maintained on the island seems to be that of a\r\nconvict establishment without its comforts and cleanliness, and that until\r\nmore attention is paid to the shipping of laborers by placing it under\r\nGovernment supervision to prevent misunderstanding and misrepresentation,\r\nand until some amelioration is shown in the treatment of the laborers,\r\nthese disorders will be of constant occurrence. I recommend legislation\r\nthat shall place labor contracts upon this and other islands having the\r\nrelation that Navassa has to the United States under the supervision of a\r\ncourt commissioner, and that shall provide at the expense of the owners an\r\nofficer to reside upon the island, with power to judge and adjust disputes\r\nand to enforce a just and humane treatment of the employees. It is\r\ninexcusable that American laborers should be left within our own\r\njurisdiction without access to any Government officer or tribunal for their\r\nprotection and the redress of their wrongs.\r\n\r\nInternational copyright has been secured, in accordance with the conditions\r\nof the act of March 3, 1891, with Belgium, France, Great Britain and the\r\nBritish possessions, and Switzerland, the laws of those countries\r\npermitting to our citizens the benefit of copyright on substantially the\r\nsame basis as to their own citizens or subjects.\r\n\r\nWith Germany a special convention has been negotiated upon this subject\r\nwhich will bring that country within the reciprocal benefits of our\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe general interest in the operations of the Treasury Department has been\r\nmuch augmented during the last year by reason of the conflicting\r\npredictions, which accompanied and followed the tariff and other\r\nlegislation of the last Congress affecting the revenues, as to the results\r\nof this legislation upon the Treasury and upon the country. On the one hand\r\nit was contended that imports would so fall off as to leave the Treasury\r\nbankrupt and that the prices of articles entering into the living of the\r\npeople would be so enhanced as to disastrously affect their comfort and\r\nhappiness, while on the other it was argued that the loss to the revenue,\r\nlargely the result of placing sugar on the free list, would be a direct\r\ngain to the people; that the prices of the necessaries of life, including\r\nthose most highly protected, would not be enhanced; that labor would have a\r\nlarger market and the products of the farm advanced prices, while the\r\nTreasury surplus and receipts would be adequate to meet the appropriations,\r\nincluding the large exceptional expenditures for the refunding to the\r\nStates of the direct tax and the redemption of the 4 1/2 per cent bonds.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of the\r\neffects of the legislation to which I have referred; but a brief\r\nexamination of the statistics of the Treasury and a general glance at the\r\nstate of business throughout the country will, I think, satisfy any\r\nimpartial inquirer that its results have disappointed the evil prophecies\r\nof its opponents and in a large measure realized the hopeful predictions of\r\nits friends. Rarely, if ever before, in the history of the country has\r\nthere been a time when the proceeds of one day's labor or the product of\r\none farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of those things that\r\nenter into the living of the masses of the people. I believe that a full\r\ntest will develop the fact that the tariff act of the Fifty-first Congress\r\nis very favorable in its average effect upon the prices of articles\r\nentering into common use.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months from October 1, 1890, to September 30, 1891, the\r\ntotal value of our foreign commerce (imports and exports combined) was\r\n$1,747,806,406, which was the largest of any year in the history of the\r\nUnited States. The largest in any previous year was in 1890, when our\r\ncommerce amounted to $1,647,139,093, and the last year exceeds this\r\nenormous aggregate by over one hundred millions. It is interesting, and to\r\nsome will be surprising, to know that during the year ending September 30,\r\n1891, our imports of merchandise amounted to $824,715,270, which was an\r\nincrease of more than $11,000,000 over the value of the imports of the\r\ncorresponding months of the preceding year, when the imports of merchandise\r\nwere unusually large in anticipation of the tariff legislation then\r\npending. The average annual value of the imports of merchandise for the ten\r\nyears from 1881 to 1890 was $692,186,522, and during the year ending\r\nSeptember 30, 1891, this annual average was exceeded by $132,528,469.\r\n\r\nThe value of free imports during the twelve months ending September 30,\r\n1891, was $118,092,387 more than the value of free imports during the\r\ncorresponding twelve months of the preceding year, and there was during the\r\nsame period a decrease of $106,846,508 in the value of imports of dutiable\r\nmerchandise. The percentage of merchandise admitted free of duty during the\r\nyear to which I have referred, the first under the new tariff, was 48.18,\r\nwhile during the preceding twelve months, under the old tariff, the\r\npercentage was 34.27, an increase of 13.91 per cent. If we take the six\r\nmonths ending September 30 last, which covers the time during which sugars\r\nhave been admitted free of duty, the per cent of value of merchandise\r\nimported free of duty is found to be 55.37, which is a larger percentage of\r\nfree imports than during any prior fiscal year in the history of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to exports of merchandise, the statistics are full of\r\ngratification. The value of such exports of merchandise for the twelve\r\nmonths ending September 30, 1891, was $923,091,136, while for the\r\ncorresponding previous twelve months it was $860,177,115, an increase of\r\n$62,914,021, which is nearly three times the average annual increase of\r\nexports of merchandise for the preceding twenty years. This exceeds in\r\namount and value the exports of merchandise during any year in the history\r\nof the Government. The increase in the value of exports of agricultural\r\nproducts during the year referred to over the corresponding twelve months\r\nof the prior year was $45,846,197, while the increase in the value of\r\nexports of manufactured products was $16,838,240.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly nothing in the condition of trade, foreign or domestic,\r\nthere is certainly nothing in the condition of our people of any class, to\r\nsuggest that the existing tariff and revenue legislation bears oppressively\r\nupon the people or retards the commercial development of the nation. It may\r\nbe argued that our condition would be better if tariff legislation were\r\nupon a free-trade basis; but it can not be denied that all the conditions\r\nof prosperity and of general contentment are present in a larger degree\r\nthan ever before in our history, and that, too, just when it was prophesied\r\nthey would be in the worst state. Agitation for radical changes in tariff\r\nand financial legislation can not help but may seriously impede business,\r\nto the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation is\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nI think there are conclusive evidences that the new tariff has created\r\nseveral great industries, which will within a few years give employment to\r\nseveral hundred thousand American working men and women. In view of the\r\nsomewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the United States,\r\nevery patriotic citizen should rejoice at such a result.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows that the total receipts\r\nof the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1891, were $458,544,233.03, while the expenditures for the same period were\r\n$421,304,470.46, leaving a surplus of $37,239,762.57.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, actual and estimated,\r\nare $433,000,000 and the expenditures $409,000,000. For the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1893, the estimated receipts are $455,336,350 and the\r\nexpenditures $441,300,093.\r\n\r\nUnder the law of July 14, 1890, the Secretary of the Treasury has purchased\r\n(since August 13) during the fiscal year 48,393,113 ounces of silver\r\nbullion at an average cost of $1.045 per ounce. The highest price paid\r\nduring the year was $1.2025 and the lowest $0.9636. In exchange for this\r\nsilver bullion there have been issued $50,577,498 of the Treasury notes\r\nauthorized by the act. The lowest price of silver reached during the fiscal\r\nyear was $0.9636 on April 22, 1891; but on November 1 the market price was\r\nonly $0.96, which would give to the silver dollar a bullion value of 74 1/4\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nBefore the influence of the prospective silver legislation was felt in the\r\nmarket silver was worth in New York about $0.955 per ounce. The ablest\r\nadvocates of free coinage in the last Congress were most confident in their\r\npredictions that the purchases by the Government required by the law would\r\nat once bring the price of silver to $1.2929 per ounce, which would make\r\nthe bullion value of a dollar 100 cents and hold it there. The prophecies\r\nof the antisilver men of disasters to result from the coinage of $2,000,000\r\nper month were not wider of the mark. The friends of free silver are not\r\nagreed, I think, as to the causes that brought their hopeful predictions to\r\nnaught. Some facts are known. The exports of silver from London to India\r\nduring the first nine months of this calendar year fell off over 50 per\r\ncent, or $17,202,730, compared with the same months of the preceding year.\r\nThe exports of domestic silver bullion from this country, which had\r\naveraged for the last ten years over $17,000,000, fell in the last fiscal\r\nyear to $13,797,391, while for the first time in recent years the imports\r\nof silver into this country exceeded the exports by the sum of $2,745,365.\r\nIn the previous year the net exports of silver from the United States\r\namounted to $8,545,455. The production of the United States increased from\r\n50,000,000 ounces in 1889 to 54,500,000 in 1890. The Government is now\r\nbuying and putting aside annually 54,000,000 ounces, which, allowing for\r\n7,140,000 ounces of new bullion used in the arts, is 6,640,000 more than\r\nour domestic products available for coinage.\r\n\r\nI hope the depression in the price of silver is temporary and that a\r\nfurther trial of this legislation will more favorably affect it. That the\r\nincreased volume of currency thus supplied for the use of the people was\r\nneeded and that beneficial results upon trade and prices have followed this\r\nlegislation I think must be very clear to everyone. Nor should it be\r\nforgotten that for every dollar of these notes issued a full dollar's worth\r\nof silver bullion is at the time deposited in the Treasury as a security\r\nfor its redemption. Upon this subject, as upon the tariff, my\r\nrecommendation is that the existing laws be given a full trial and that our\r\nbusiness interests be spared the distressing influence which threats of\r\nradical changes always impart. Under existing legislation it is in the\r\npower of the Treasury Department to maintain that essential condition of\r\nnational finance as well as of commercial prosperity--the parity in use of\r\nthe coined dollars and their paper representatives. The assurance that\r\nthese powers would be freely and unhesitatingly used has done much to\r\nproduce and sustain the present favorable business conditions.\r\n\r\nI am still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existing\r\nconditions would disastrously affect our business interests at home and\r\nabroad. We could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power\r\nof the gold and silver dollar in our own markets, and in foreign trade the\r\nstamp gives no added value to the bullion contained in coins. The producers\r\nof the country, its farmers and laborers, have the highest interest that\r\nevery dollar, paper or coin, issued by the Government shall be as good as\r\nany other. If there is one less valuable than another, its sure and\r\nconstant errand will be to pay them for their toil and for their crops. The\r\nmoney lender will protect himself by stipulating for payment in gold, but\r\nthe laborer has never been able to do that. To place business upon a silver\r\nbasis would mean a sudden and severe contraction of the currency by the\r\nwithdrawal of gold and gold notes and such an unsettling of all values as\r\nwould produce a commercial panic. I can not believe that a people so strong\r\nand prosperous as ours will promote such a policy.\r\n\r\nThe producers of silver are entitled to just consideration, but they should\r\nnot forget that the Government is now buying and putting out of the market\r\nwhat is the equivalent of the entire product of our silver mines. This is\r\nmore than they themselves thought of asking two years ago. I believe it is\r\nthe earnest desire of a great majority of the people, as it is mine, that a\r\nfull coin use shall be made of silver just as soon as the cooperation of\r\nother nations can be secured and a ratio fixed that will give circulation\r\nequally to gold and silver. The business of the world requires the use of\r\nboth metals; but I do not see any prospect of gain, but much of loss, by\r\ngiving up the present system, in which a full use is made of gold and a\r\nlarge use of silver, for one in which silver alone will circulate. Such an\r\nevent would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver\r\nmovement. Bimetallism is the desired end, and the true friends of silver\r\nwill be careful not to overrun the goal and bring in silver monometallism\r\nwith its necessary attendants--the loss of our gold to Europe and the\r\nrelief of the pressure there for a larger currency. I have endeavored by\r\nthe use of official and unofficial agencies to keep a close observation of\r\nthe state of public sentiment in Europe upon this question and have not\r\nfound it to be such as to justify me in proposing an international\r\nconference. There is, however, I am sure, a growing sentiment in Europe in\r\nfavor of a larger use of silver, and I know of no more effectual way of\r\npromoting this sentiment than by accumulating gold here. A scarcity of gold\r\nin the European reserves will be the most persuasive argument for the use\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\nThe exports of gold to Europe, which began in February last and continued\r\nuntil the close of July, aggregated over $70,000,000. The net loss of gold\r\nduring the fiscal year was nearly $68,000,000. That no serious monetary\r\ndisturbance resulted was most gratifying and gave to Europe fresh evidence\r\nof the strength and stability of our financial institutions. With the\r\nmovement of crops the outflow of gold was speedily stopped and a return set\r\nin. Up to December 1 we had recovered of our gold lost at the port of New\r\nYork $27,854,000, and it is confidently believed that during the winter and\r\nspring this aggregate will be steadily and largely increased.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a large cash surplus in the Treasury has for many years\r\nbeen the subject of much unfavorable criticism, and has furnished an\r\nargument to those who have desired to place the tariff upon a purely\r\nrevenue basis. It was agreed by all that the withdrawal from circulation of\r\nso large an amount of money was an embarrassment to the business of the\r\ncountry and made necessary the intervention of the Department at frequent\r\nintervals to relieve threatened monetary panics. The surplus on March 1,\r\n1889, was $183,827,190.29. The policy of applying this surplus to the\r\nredemption of the interest-bearing securities of the United States was\r\nthought to be preferable to that of depositing it without interest in\r\nselected national banks. There have been redeemed since the date last\r\nmentioned of interest-bearing securities $259,079,350, resulting in a\r\nreduction of the annual interest charge of $11,684,675. The money which had\r\nbeen deposited in banks without interest has been gradually withdrawn and\r\nused in the redemption of bonds.\r\n\r\nThe result of this policy, of the silver legislation, and of the refunding\r\nof the 4 1/2 per cent bonds has been a large increase of the money in\r\ncirculation. At the date last named the circulation was $1,404,205,896, or\r\n$23.03 per capita, while on the 1st day of December, 1891, it had increased\r\nto $1,577,262,070, or $24.38 per capita. The offer of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to the holders of the 4 1/2 per cent bonds to extend the time of\r\nredemption, at the option of the Government, at an interest of 2 per cent,\r\nwas accepted by the holders of about one-half the amount, and the\r\nunextended bonds are being redeemed on presentation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War exhibits the results of an intelligent,\r\nprogressive, and businesslike administration of a Department which has been\r\ntoo much regarded as one of mere routine. The separation of Secretary\r\nProctor from the Department by reason of his appointment as a Senator from\r\nthe State of Vermont is a source of great regret to me and to his\r\ncolleagues in the Cabinet, as I am sure it will be to all those who have\r\nhad business with the Department while under his charge.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of army affairs some especially good work has been\r\naccomplished. The efforts of the Secretary to reduce the percentage of\r\ndesertions by removing the causes that promoted it have been so successful\r\nas to enable him to report for the last year a lower percentage of\r\ndesertion than has been before reached in the history of the Army. The\r\nresulting money saving is considerable, but the improvement in the morale\r\nof the enlisted men is the most valuable incident of the reforms which have\r\nbrought about this result.\r\n\r\nThe work of securing sites for shore batteries for harbor defense and the\r\nmanufacture of mortars and guns of high power to equip them have made good\r\nprogress during the year. The preliminary work of tests and plans which so\r\nlong delayed a start is now out of the way. Some guns have been completed,\r\nand with an enlarged shop and a more complete equipment at Watervliet the\r\nArmy will soon be abreast of the Navy in gun construction. Whatever\r\nunavoidable causes of delay may arise, there should be none from delayed or\r\ninsufficient appropriations. We shall be greatly embarrassed in the proper\r\ndistribution and use of naval vessels until adequate shore defenses are\r\nprovided for our harbors.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendation of the Secretary that the three-battalion\r\norganization be adopted for the infantry. The adoption of a smokeless\r\npowder and of a modern rifle equal in range, precision, and rapidity of\r\nfire to the best now in use will, I hope, not be longer delayed.\r\n\r\nThe project of enlisting Indians and organizing them into separate\r\ncompanies upon the same basis as other soldiers was made the subject of\r\nvery careful study by the Secretary and received my approval. Seven\r\ncompanies have been completely organized and seven more are in process of\r\norganization. The results of six months' training have more than realized\r\nthe highest anticipations. The men are readily brought under discipline,\r\nacquire the drill with facility, and show great pride in the right\r\ndischarge of their duty and perfect loyalty to their officers, who declare\r\nthat they would take them into action with confidence. The discipline,\r\norder, and cleanliness of the military posts will have a wholesome and\r\nelevating influence upon the men enlisted, and through them upon their\r\ntribes, while a friendly feeling for the whites and a greater respect for\r\nthe Government will certainly be promoted.\r\n\r\nThe great work done in the Record and Pension Division of the War\r\nDepartment by Major Ainsworth, of the Medical Corps, and the clerks under\r\nhim is entitled to honorable mention. Taking up the work with nearly 41,000\r\ncases behind, he closed the last fiscal year without a single case left\r\nover, though the new cases had increased 52 per cent in number over the\r\nprevious year by reason of the pension legislation of the last Congress.\r\n\r\nI concur in the recommendation of the Attorney-General that the right in\r\nfelony cases to a review by the Supreme court be limited. It would seem\r\nthat personal liberty would have a safe guaranty if the right of review in\r\ncases involving only fine and imprisonment were limited to the circuit\r\ncourt of appeals, unless a constitutional question should in some way be\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the Court of Private Land Claims, provided for by the act of\r\nMarch 3, 1891, have been appointed and the court organized. It is now\r\npossible to give early relief to communities long repressed in their\r\ndevelopment by unsettled land titles and to establish the possession and\r\nright of settlers whose lands have been rendered valueless by adverse and\r\nunfounded claims.\r\n\r\nThe act of July 9, 1888, provided for the incorporation and management of a\r\nreform school for girls in the District of Columbia; but it has remained\r\ninoperative for the reason that no appropriation has been made for\r\nconstruction or maintenance. The need of such an institution is very\r\nurgent. Many girls could be saved from depraved lives by the wholesome\r\ninfluences and restraints of such a school. I recommend that the necessary\r\nappropriation be made for a site and for construction.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement by the Treasury Department of the law prohibiting the\r\ncoming of Chinese to the United States has been effective as to such as\r\nseek to land from vessels entering our ports. The result has been to divert\r\nthe travel to vessels entering the ports of British Columbia, whence\r\npassage into the United States at obscure points along the Dominion\r\nboundary is easy. A very considerable number of Chinese laborers have\r\nduring the past year entered the United States from Canada and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Treasury Department and of the Department of Justice\r\nhave used every means at their command to intercept this immigration; but\r\nthe impossibility of perfectly guarding our extended frontier is apparent.\r\nThe Dominion government collects a head tax of $50 from every Chinaman\r\nentering Canada, and thus derives a considerable revenue from those who\r\nonly use its ports to reach a position of advantage to evade our exclusion\r\nlaws. There seems to be satisfactory evidence that the business of passing\r\nChinamen through Canada to the United States is organized and quite active.\r\nThe Department of Justice has construed the laws to require the return of\r\nany Chinaman found to be unlawfully in this country to China as the country\r\nfrom which he came, notwithstanding the fact that he came by way of Canada;\r\nbut several of the district courts have in cases brought before them\r\noverruled this view of the law and decided that such persons must be\r\nreturned to Canada. This construction robs the law of all effectiveness,\r\neven if the decrees could be executed, for the men returned can the next\r\nday recross our border. But the only appropriation made is for sending them\r\nback to China, and the Canadian officials refuse to allow them to reenter\r\nCanada without the payment of the fifty-dollar head tax. I recommend such\r\nlegislation as will remedy these defects in the law.\r\n\r\nIn previous messages I have called the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity of so extending the jurisdiction of the United States courts as\r\nto make triable therein any felony committed while in the act of violating\r\na law of the United States. These courts can not have that independence and\r\neffectiveness which the Constitution contemplates so long as the felonious\r\nkilling of court officers, jurors, and witnesses in the discharge of their\r\nduties or by reason of their acts as such is only cognizable in the State\r\ncourts. The work done by the Attorney-General and the officers of his\r\nDepartment, even under the present inadequate legislation, has produced\r\nsome notable results in the interest of law and order.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General and also the Commissioners of the District of Columbia\r\ncall attention to the defectiveness and inadequacy of the laws relating to\r\ncrimes against chastity in the District of Columbia. A stringent code upon\r\nthis subject has been provided by Congress for Utah, and it is a matter of\r\nsurprise that the needs of this District should have been so long\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Postmaster-General some very gratifying results are\r\nexhibited and many betterments of the service suggested. A perusal of the\r\nreport gives abundant evidence that the supervision and direction of the\r\npostal system have been characterized by an intelligent and conscientious\r\ndesire to improve the service. The revenues of the Department show an\r\nincrease of over $5,000,000, with a deficiency for the year 1892 of less\r\nthan $4,000,000, while the estimate for the year 1893 shows a surplus of\r\nreceipts over expenditures.\r\n\r\nOcean mail post-offices have been established upon the steamers of the\r\nNorth German Lloyd and Hamburg lines, saving by the distribution on\r\nshipboard from two to fourteen hours' time in the delivery of mail at the\r\nport of entry and often much more than this in the delivery at interior\r\nplaces. So thoroughly has this system, initiated by Germany and the United\r\nStates, evidenced its usefulness that it can not be long before it is\r\ninstalled upon all the great ocean mail-carrying steamships.\r\n\r\nEight thousand miles of new postal service has been established upon\r\nrailroads, the car distribution to substations in the great cities has been\r\nincreased about 12 per cent, while the percentage of errors in distribution\r\nhas during the past year been reduced over one-half. An appropriation was\r\ngiven by the last Congress for the purpose of making some experiments in\r\nfree delivery in the smaller cities and towns. The results of these\r\nexperiments have been so satisfactory that the Postmaster-General\r\nrecommends, and I concur in the recommendation, that the free-delivery\r\nsystem be at once extended to towns of 5,000 population. His discussion of\r\nthe inadequate facilities extended under our present system to rural\r\ncommunities and his suggestions with a view to give these communities a\r\nfuller participation in the benefits of the postal service are worthy of\r\nyour careful consideration. It is not just that the farmer, who receives\r\nhis mail at a neighboring town, should not only be compelled to send to the\r\npost-office for it, but to pay a considerable rent for a box in which to\r\nplace it or to wait his turn at a general-delivery window, while the city\r\nresident has his mail brought to his door. It is stated that over 54,000\r\nneighborhoods are under the present system receiving mail at post-offices\r\nwhere money orders and postal notes are not issued. The extension of this\r\nsystem to these communities is especially desirable, as the patrons of such\r\noffices are not possessed of the other facilities offered in more populous\r\ncommunities for the transmission of small sums of money.\r\n\r\nI have in a message to the preceding Congress expressed my views as to a\r\nmodified use of the telegraph in connection with the postal service. In\r\npursuance of the ocean mail law of March 3, 1891, and after a most careful\r\nstudy of the whole subject and frequent conferences with ship-owners,\r\nboards of trade, and others, advertisements were issued by the\r\npostmaster-General for 53 lines of ocean mail service--10 to Great Britain\r\nand the Continent, 27 to South America, 3 to China and Japan, 4 to\r\nAustralia and the Pacific islands, 7 to the West Indies, and 2 to Mexico.\r\nIt was not, of course, expected that bids for all these lines would be\r\nreceived or that service upon them all would be contracted for. It was\r\nintended, in furtherance of the act, to secure as many new lines as\r\npossible, while including in the list most or all of the foreign lines now\r\noccupied by American ships. It was hoped that a line to England and perhaps\r\none to the Continent would be secured; but the outlay required to equip\r\nsuch lines wholly with new ships of the first class and the difficulty of\r\nestablishing new lines in competition with those already established\r\ndeterred bidders whose interest had been enlisted. It is hoped that a way\r\nmay yet be found of overcoming these difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe Brazil Steamship Company, by reason of a miscalculation as to the speed\r\nof its vessels, was not able to bid under the terms of the advertisement.\r\nThe policy of the Department was to secure from the established lines an\r\nimproved service as a condition of giving to them the benefits of the law.\r\nThis in all instances has been attained. The Postmaster-General estimates\r\nthat an expenditure in American shipyards of about $10,000,000 will be\r\nnecessary to enable the bidders to construct the ships called for by the\r\nservice which they have accepted. I do not think there is any reason for\r\ndiscouragement or for any turning back from the policy of this legislation.\r\nIndeed, a good beginning has been made, and as the subject is further\r\nconsidered and understood by capitalists and shipping people new lines will\r\nbe ready to meet future proposals, and we may date from the passage of this\r\nlaw the revival of American shipping interests and the recovery of a fair\r\nshare of the carrying trade of the world. We were receiving for foreign\r\npostage nearly $2,000,000 under the old system, and the outlay for ocean\r\nmail service did not exceed $600,000 per annum. It is estimated by the\r\nPostmaster-General that if all the contracts proposed are completed it will\r\nrequire $247,354 for this year in addition to the appropriation for sea and\r\ninland postage already in the estimates, and that for the next fiscal year,\r\nending June 30, 1893, there would probably be needed about $560,000.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a gratifying increase of new\r\nnaval vessels in commission. The Newark, Concord, Bennington, and\r\nMiantonomoh have been added during the year, with an aggregate of something\r\nmore than 11,000 tons. Twenty-four warships of all classes are now under\r\nconstruction in the navy-yards and private shops; but while the work upon\r\nthem is going forward satisfactorily, the completion of the more important\r\nvessels will yet require about a year's time. Some of the vessels now\r\nunder construction, it is believed, will be triumphs of naval engineering.\r\nWhen it is recollected that the work of building a modern navy was only\r\ninitiated in the year 1883, that our naval constructors and shipbuilders\r\nwere practically without experience in the construction of large iron or\r\nsteel ships, that our engine shops were unfamiliar with great marine\r\nengines, and that the manufacture of steel forgings for guns and plates was\r\nalmost wholly a foreign industry, the progress that has been made is not\r\nonly highly satisfactory, but furnishes the assurance that the United\r\nStates will before long attain in the construction of such vessels, with\r\ntheir engines and armaments, the same preeminence which it attained when\r\nthe best instrument of ocean commerce was the clipper ship and the most\r\nimpressive exhibit of naval power the old wooden three-decker man-of-war.\r\nThe officers of the Navy and the proprietors and engineers of our great\r\nprivate shops have responded with wonderful intelligence and professional\r\nzeal to the confidence expressed by Congress in its liberal legislation. We\r\nhave now at Washington a gun shop, organized and conducted by naval\r\nofficers, that in its system, economy, and product is unexcelled.\r\nExperiments with armor plate have been conducted during the year with most\r\nimportant results. It is now believed that a plate of higher resisting\r\npower than any in use has been found and that the tests have demonstrated\r\nthat cheaper methods of manufacture than those heretofore thought necessary\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\nI commend to your favorable consideration the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary, who has, I am sure, given to them the most conscientious study.\r\nThere should be no hesitation in promptly completing a navy of the best\r\nmodern type large enough to enable this country to display its flag in all\r\nseas for the protection of its citizens and of its extending commerce. The\r\nworld needs no assurance of the peaceful purposes of the United States, but\r\nwe shall probably be in the future more largely a competitor in the\r\ncommerce of the world, and it is essential to the dignity of this nation\r\nand to that peaceful influence which it should exercise on this hemisphere\r\nthat its Navy should be adequate both upon the shores of the Atlantic and\r\nof the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that a very gratifying\r\nprogress has been made in all of the bureaus which make up that complex and\r\ndifficult Department.\r\n\r\nThe work in the Bureau of Indian Affairs was perhaps never so large as now,\r\nby reason of the numerous negotiations which have been proceeding with the\r\ntribes for a reduction of the reservations, with the incident labor of\r\nmaking allotments, and was never more carefully conducted. The provision of\r\nadequate school facilities for Indian children and the locating of adult\r\nIndians upon farms involve the solution of the \"Indian question.\"\r\nEverything else--rations, annuities, and tribal negotiations, with the\r\nagents, inspectors, and commissioners who distribute and conduct them--must\r\npass away when the Indian has become a citizen, secure in the individual\r\nownership of a farm from which he derives his subsistence by his own labor,\r\nprotected by and subordinate to the laws which govern the white man, and\r\nprovided by the General Government or by the local communities in which he\r\nlives with the means of educating his children. When an Indian becomes a\r\ncitizen in an organized State or Territory, his relation to the General\r\nGovernment ceases in great measure to be that of a ward; but the General\r\nGovernment ought not at once to put upon the State or Territory the burden\r\nof the education of his children.\r\n\r\nIt has been my thought that the Government schools and school buildings\r\nupon the reservations would be absorbed by the school systems of the States\r\nand Territories; but as it has been found necessary to protect the Indian\r\nagainst the compulsory alienation of his land by exempting him from\r\ntaxation for a period of twenty-five years, it would seem to be right that\r\nthe General Government, certainly where there are tribal funds in its\r\npossession, should pay to the school fund of the State what would be\r\nequivalent to the local school tax upon the property of the Indian. It will\r\nbe noticed from the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that\r\nalready some contracts have been made with district schools for the\r\neducation of Indian children. There is great advantage, I think, in\r\nbringing the Indian children into mixed schools. This process will be\r\ngradual, and in the meantime the present educational provisions and\r\narrangements, the result of the best experience of those who have been\r\ncharged with this work, should be continued. This will enable those\r\nreligious bodies that have undertaken the work of Indian education with so\r\nmuch zeal and with results so restraining and beneficent to place their\r\ninstitutions in new and useful relations to the Indian and to his white\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak among the Sioux which occurred in December last is as to its\r\ncauses and incidents fully reported upon by the War Department and the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. That these Indians had some just complaints,\r\nespecially in the matter of the reduction of the appropriation for rations\r\nand in the delays attending the enactment of laws to enable the Department\r\nto perform the engagements entered into with them, is probably true; but\r\nthe Sioux tribes are naturally warlike and turbulent, and their warriors\r\nwere excited by their medicine men and chiefs, who preached the coming of\r\nan Indian messiah who was to give them power to destroy their enemies. In\r\nview of the alarm that prevailed among the white settlers near the\r\nreservation and of the fatal consequences that would have resulted from an\r\nIndian incursion, I placed at the disposal of General Miles, commanding the\r\nDivision of the Missouri, all such forces as were thought by him to be\r\nrequired. He is entitled to the credit of having given thorough protection\r\nto the settlers and of bringing the hostiles into subjection with the least\r\npossible loss of life.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of $2,991,450 for the Choctaws and Chickasaws contained\r\nin the general Indian appropriation bill of March 3, 1891, has not been\r\nexpended, for the reason that I have not yet approved a release (to the\r\nGovernment) of the Indian claim to the lands mentioned. This matter will be\r\nmade the subject of a special message, placing before Congress all the\r\nfacts which have come to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Five Civilized Tribes now occupying the Indian\r\nTerritory to the United States is not, I believe, that best calculated to\r\npromote the highest advancement of these Indians. That there should be\r\nwithin our borders five independent states having no relations, except\r\nthose growing out of treaties, with the Government of the United States, no\r\nrepresentation in the National Legislature, its people not citizens, is a\r\nstartling anomaly.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be inevitable that there shall be before long some\r\norganic changes in the relation of these people to the United States. What\r\nform these changes should take I do not think it desirable now to suggest,\r\neven if they were well defined in my own mind. They should certainly\r\ninvolve the acceptance of citizenship by the Indians and a representation\r\nin Congress. These Indians should have opportunity to present their claims\r\nand grievances upon the floor rather than, as now, in the lobby. If a\r\ncommission could be appointed to visit these tribes to confer with them in\r\na friendly spirit upon this whole subject, even if no agreement were\r\npresently reached the feeling of the tribes upon this question would be\r\ndeveloped, and discussion would prepare the way for changes which must come\r\nsooner or later.\r\n\r\nThe good work of reducing the larger Indian reservations by allotments in\r\nseveralty to the Indians and the cession of the remaining lands to the\r\nUnited States for disposition under the homestead law has been prosecuted\r\nduring the year with energy and success. In September last I was enabled to\r\nopen to settlement in the Territory of Oklahoma 900,000 acres of land, all\r\nof which was taken up by settlers in a single day. The rush for these lands\r\nwas accompanied by a great deal of excitement, but was happily free from\r\nincidents of violence.\r\n\r\nIt was a source of great regret that I was not able to open at the same\r\ntime the surplus lands of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation, amounting\r\nto about 3,000,000 acres, by reason of the insufficiency of the\r\nappropriation for making the allotments. Deserving and impatient settlers\r\nare waiting to occupy these lands, and I urgently recommend that a special\r\ndeficiency appropriation be promptly made of the small amount needed, so\r\nthat the allotments may be completed and the surplus lands opened in time\r\nto permit the settlers to get upon their homesteads in the early spring.\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer the Cherokee Commission have completed arrangements\r\nwith the Wichita, Kickapoo, and Tonkawa tribes whereby, if the agreements\r\nare ratified by Congress, over 800,000 additional acres will be opened to\r\nsettlement in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for the release by the Cherokees of their claim to the\r\nCherokee Strip have made no substantial progress so far as the Department\r\nis officially advised, but it is still hoped that the cession of this large\r\nand valuable tract may be secured. The price which the commission was\r\nauthorized to offer--$1.25 per acre--is, in my judgment, when all the\r\ncircumstances as to title and the character of the lands are considered, a\r\nfair and adequate one, and should have been accepted by the Indians.\r\n\r\nSince March 4, 1889, about 23,000,000 acres have been separated from Indian\r\nreservations and added to the public domain for the use of those who\r\ndesired to secure free homes under our beneficent laws. It is difficult to\r\nestimate the increase of wealth which will result from the conversion of\r\nthese waste lands into farms, but it is more difficult to estimate the\r\nbetterment which will result to the families that have found renewed hope\r\nand courage in the ownership of a home and the assurance of a comfortable\r\nsubsistence under free and healthful conditions. It is also gratifying to\r\nbe able to feel, as we may, that this work has proceeded upon lines of\r\njustice toward the Indian, and that he may now, if he will, secure to\r\nhimself the good influences of a settled habitation, the fruits of\r\nindustry, and the security of citizenship.\r\n\r\nEarly in this Administration a special effort was begun to bring up the\r\nwork of the General Land Office. By faithful work the arrearages have been\r\nrapidly reduced. At the end of the last fiscal year only 84,172 final\r\nagricultural entries remained undisposed of, and the Commissioner reports\r\nthat with the present force the work can be fully brought up by the end of\r\nthe next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nYour attention is called to the difficulty presented by the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior as to the administration of the law of March 3, 1891,\r\nestablishing a Court of Private Land Claims. The small holdings intended to\r\nbe protected by the law are estimated to be more than 15,000 in number. The\r\nclaimants are a most deserving class and their titles are supported by the\r\nstrongest equities. The difficulty grows out of the fact that the lands\r\nhave largely been surveyed according to our methods, while the holdings,\r\nmany of which have been in the same family for generations, are laid out in\r\nnarrow strips a few rods wide upon a stream and running back to the hills\r\nfor pasturage and timber.. Provision should be made for numbering these\r\ntracts as lots and for patenting them by such numbers and without reference\r\nto section lines.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Pension Bureau has been characterized during the\r\nyear by great diligence. The total number of pensioners upon the roll on\r\nthe 30th day of June, 1891, was 676,160. There were allowed during the\r\nfiscal year ending at that time 250,565 cases. Of this number 102,387 were\r\nallowed under the law of June 27, 1890. The issuing of certificates has\r\nbeen proceeding at the rate of about 30,000 per month, about 75 per cent of\r\nthese being cases under the new law. The Commissioner expresses the opinion\r\nthat he will be able to carefully adjudicate and allow 350,000 claims\r\nduring the present fiscal year. The appropriation for the payment of\r\npensions for the fiscal year 1890-91 was $127,685,793.89 and the amount\r\nexpended $118,530,649.25, leaving an unexpended surplus of $9,155,144.64.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner is quite confident that there will be no call this year\r\nfor a deficiency appropriation, notwithstanding the rapidity with which the\r\nwork is being pushed. The mistake which has been made by many in their\r\nexaggerated estimates of the cost of pensions is in not taking account of\r\nthe diminished value of first payments under the recent legislation. These\r\npayments under the general law have been for many years very large, as the\r\npensions when allowed dated from the time of filing the claim, and most of\r\nthese claims had been pending for years. The first payments under the law\r\nof June, 1890, are relatively small, and as the per cent of these cases\r\nincreases and that of the old cases diminishes the annual aggregate of\r\nfirst payments is largely reduced. The Commissioner, under date of November\r\n13, furnishes me with the statement that during the last four months\r\n113,175 certificates were issued, 27,893 under the general law and 85,282\r\nunder the act of June 27, 1890. The average first payment during these four\r\nmonths was $131.85, while the average first payment upon cases allowed\r\nduring the year ending June 30, 1891, was $239.33, being a reduction in the\r\naverage first payments during these four months of $107.48.\r\n\r\nThe estimate for pension expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1893, is $144,956,000, which, after a careful examination of the subject,\r\nthe Commissioner is of the opinion will be sufficient. While these\r\ndisbursements to the disabled soldiers of the great Civil War are large,\r\nthey do not realize the exaggerated estimates of those who oppose this\r\nbeneficent legislation. The Secretary of the Interior shows with great\r\nfullness the care that is taken to exclude fraudulent claims, and also the\r\ngratifying fact that the persons to whom these pensions are going are men\r\nwho rendered not slight but substantial war service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Railroads shows that the total debt of\r\nthe subsidized railroads to the United States was on December 31, 1890,\r\n$112,512,613.06. A large part of this debt is now fast approaching\r\nmaturity, with no adequate provision for its payment. Some policy for\r\ndealing with this debt with a view to its ultimate collection should be at\r\nonce adopted. It is very difficult, well-nigh impossible, for so large a\r\nbody as the Congress to conduct the necessary negotiations and\r\ninvestigations. I therefore recommend that provision be made for the\r\nappointment of a commission to agree upon and report a plan for dealing\r\nwith this debt.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Census Bureau is now far in advance and the great bulk of\r\nthe enormous labor involved completed. It will be more strictly a\r\nstatistical exhibit and less encumbered by essays than its immediate\r\npredecessors. The methods pursued have been fair, careful, and intelligent,\r\nand have secured the approval of the statisticians who have followed them\r\nwith a scientific and nonpartisan interest. The appropriations necessary to\r\nthe early completion and publication of the authorized volumes should be\r\ngiven in time to secure against delays, which increase the cost and at the\r\nsame time diminish the value of the work.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary exhibits with interesting fullness the\r\ncondition of the Territories. They have shared with the States the great\r\nincrease in farm products, and are bringing yearly large areas into\r\ncultivation by extending their irrigating canals. This work is being done\r\nby individuals or local corporations and without that system which a full\r\npreliminary survey of the water supply and of the irrigable lands would\r\nenable them to adopt. The future of the Territories of New Mexico, Arizona,\r\nand Utah in their material growth and in the increase, independence, and\r\nhappiness of their people is very largely dependent upon wise and timely\r\nlegislation, either by Congress or their own legislatures, regulating the\r\ndistribution of the water supply furnished by their streams. If this matter\r\nis much longer neglected, private corporations will have unrestricted\r\ncontrol of one of the elements of life and the patentees of the arid lands\r\nwill be tenants at will of the water companies.\r\n\r\nThe United States should part with its ownership of the water sources and\r\nthe sites for reservoirs, whether to the States and Territories or to\r\nindividuals or corporations, only upon conditions that will insure to the\r\nsettlers their proper water supply upon equal and reasonable terms. In the\r\nTerritories this whole subject is under the full control of Congress, and\r\nin the States it is practically so as long as the Government holds the\r\ntitle to the reservoir sites and water sources and can grant them upon such\r\nconditions as it chooses to impose. The improvident granting of franchises\r\nof enormous value without recompense to the State or municipality from\r\nwhich they proceed and without proper protection of the public interests is\r\nthe most noticeable and flagrant evil of modern legislation. This fault\r\nshould not be committed in dealing with a subject that will before many\r\nyears affect so vitally thousands of our people.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of Congress for the repression of polygamy has, after years\r\nof resistance on the part of the Mormons, at last brought them to the\r\nconclusion that resistance is unprofitable and unavailing. The power of\r\nCongress over this subject should not be surrendered until we have\r\nsatisfactory evidence that the people of the State to be created would\r\nexercise the exclusive power of the State over this subject in the same\r\nway. The question is not whether these people now obey the laws of Congress\r\nagainst polygamy, but rather would they make, enforce, and maintain such\r\nlaws themselves if absolutely free to regulate the subject? We can not\r\nafford to experiment with this subject, for when a State is once\r\nconstituted the act is final and any mistake irretrievable. No compact in\r\nthe enabling act could, in my opinion, be binding or effective.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made for the organization of a simple form of\r\ntown government in Alaska, with power to regulate such matters as are\r\nusually in the States under municipal control. These local civil\r\norganizations will give better protection in some matters than the present\r\nskeleton Territorial organization. Proper restrictions as to the power to\r\nlevy taxes and to create debt should be imposed.\r\n\r\nIf the establishment of the Department of Agriculture was regarded by\r\nanyone as a mere concession to the unenlightened demand of a worthy class\r\nof people, that impression has been most effectually removed by the great\r\nresults already attained. Its home influence has been very great in\r\ndisseminating agricultural and horticultural information, in stimulating\r\nand directing a further diversification of crops, in detecting and\r\neradicating diseases of domestic animals, and, more than all, in the close\r\nand informal contact which it has established and maintains with the\r\nfarmers and stock raisers of the whole country. Every request for\r\ninformation has had prompt attention and every suggestion merited\r\nconsideration. The scientific corps of the Department is of a high order\r\nand is pushing its investigations with method and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe inspection by this Department of cattle and pork products intended for\r\nshipment abroad has been the basis of the success which has attended our\r\nefforts to secure the removal of the restrictions maintained by the\r\nEuropean Governments.\r\n\r\nFor ten years protests and petitions upon this subject from the packers and\r\nstock raisers of the United States have been directed against these\r\nrestrictions, which so seriously limited our markets and curtailed the\r\nprofits of the farm. It is a source of general congratulation that success\r\nhas at last been attained, for the effects of an enlarged foreign market\r\nfor these meats will be felt not only by the farmer, but in our public\r\nfinances and in every branch of trade. It is particularly fortunate that\r\nthe increased demand for food products resulting from the removal of the\r\nrestrictions upon our meats and from the reciprocal trade arrangements to\r\nwhich I have referred should have come at a time when the agricultural\r\nsurplus is so large. Without the help thus derived lower prices would have\r\nprevailed. The Secretary of Agriculture estimates that the restrictions\r\nupon the importation of our pork products into Europe lost us a market for\r\n$20,000,000 worth of these products annually.\r\n\r\nThe grain crop of this year was the largest in our history--50 per cent\r\ngreater than that of last year--and yet the new markets that have been\r\nopened and the larger demand resulting from short crops in Europe have\r\nsustained prices to such an extent that the enormous surplus of meats and\r\nbreadstuffs will be marketed at good prices, bringing relief and prosperity\r\nto an industry that was much depressed. The value of the grain crop of the\r\nUnited States is estimated by the Secretary to be this year $500,000,000\r\nmore than last; of meats $150,000,000 more, and of all products of the farm\r\n$700,000,000 more. It is not inappropriate, I think, here to suggest that\r\nour satisfaction in the contemplation of this marvelous addition to the\r\nnational wealth is unclouded by any suspicion of the currency by which it\r\nis measured and in which the farmer is paid for the products of his\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Civil Service Commission should receive the careful\r\nattention of the opponents as well as the friends of this reform. The\r\nCommission invites a personal inspection by Senators and Representatives of\r\nits records and methods, and every fair critic will feel that such an\r\nexamination should precede a judgment of condemnation either of the system\r\nor its administration. It is not claimed that either is perfect, but I\r\nbelieve that the law is being executed with impartiality and that the\r\nsystem is incomparably better and fairer than that of appointments upon\r\nfavor. I have during the year extended the classified service to include\r\nsuperintendents, teachers, matrons, and physicians in the Indian service.\r\nThis branch of the service is largely related to educational and\r\nphilanthropic work and will obviously be the better for the change.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the several Executive Departments have been directed to\r\nestablish at once an efficiency record as the basis of a comparative rating\r\nof the clerks within the classified service, with a view to placing\r\npromotions therein upon the basis of merit. I am confident that such a\r\nrecord, fairly kept and open to the inspection of those interested, will\r\npowerfully stimulate the work of the Departments and will be accepted by\r\nall as placing the troublesome matter of promotions upon a just basis.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the appropriation for the Civil Service Commission be made\r\nadequate to the increased work of the next fiscal year.\r\n\r\nI have twice before urgently called the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity of legislation for the protection of the lives of railroad\r\nemployees, but nothing has yet been done. During the year ending June 30,\r\n1890, 369 brakemen were killed and 7,841 maimed while engaged in coupling\r\ncars. The total number of railroad employees killed during the year was\r\n2,451 and the number injured 22,390. This is a cruel and largely needless\r\nsacrifice. The Government is spending nearly $1,000,000 annually to save\r\nthe lives of shipwrecked seamen; every steam vessel is rigidly inspected\r\nand required to adopt the most approved safety appliances. All this is\r\ngood. But how shall we excuse the lack of interest and effort in behalf of\r\nthis army of brave young men who in our land commerce are being sacrificed\r\nevery year by the continued use of antiquated and dangerous appliances? A\r\nlaw requiring of every railroad engaged in interstate commerce the\r\nequipment each year of a given per cent of its freight cars with automatic\r\ncouplers and air brakes would compel an agreement between the roads as to\r\nthe kind of brakes and couplers to be used, and would very soon and very\r\ngreatly reduce the present fearful death rate among railroad employees.\r\n\r\nThe method of appointment by the States of electors of President and\r\nVice-President has recently attracted renewed interest by reason of a\r\ndeparture by the State of Michigan from the method which had become uniform\r\nin all the States. Prior to 1832 various methods had been used by the\r\ndifferent States, and even by the same State. In some the choice was made\r\nby the legislature; in others electors were chosen by districts, but more\r\ngenerally by the voters of the whole State upon a general ticket. The\r\nmovement toward the adoption of the last-named method had an early\r\nbeginning and went steadily forward among the States until in 1832 there\r\nremained but a single State (South Carolina) that had not adopted it. That\r\nState until the Civil War continued to choose its electors by a vote of the\r\nlegislature, but after the war changed its method and conformed to the\r\npractice of the other States. For nearly sixty years all the States save\r\none have appointed their electors by a popular vote upon a general ticket,\r\nand for nearly thirty years this method was universal.\r\n\r\nAfter a full test of other methods, without important division or dissent\r\nin any State and without any purpose of party advantage, as we must\r\nbelieve, but solely upon the considerations that uniformity was desirable\r\nand that a general election in territorial divisions not subject to change\r\nwas most consistent with the popular character of our institutions, best\r\npreserved the equality of the voters, and perfectly removed the choice of\r\nPresident from the baneful influence of the \"gerrymander,\" the practice of\r\nall the States was brought into harmony. That this concurrence should now\r\nbe broken is, I think, an unfortunate and even a threatening episode, and\r\none that may well suggest whether the States that still give their approval\r\nto the old and prevailing method ought not to secure by a constitutional\r\namendment a practice which has had the approval of all. The recent Michigan\r\nlegislation provides for choosing what are popularly known as the\r\nCongressional electors for President by Congressional districts and the two\r\nSenatorial electors by districts created for that purpose. This legislation\r\nwas, of course, accompanied by a new Congressional apportionment, and the\r\ntwo statutes bring the electoral vote of the State under the influence of\r\nthe \"gerrymander.\"\r\n\r\nThese gerrymanders for Congressional purposes are in most cases buttressed\r\nby a gerrymander of the legislative districts, thus making it impossible\r\nfor a majority of the legal voters of the State to correct the\r\napportionment and equalize the Congressional districts. A minority rule is\r\nestablished that only a political convulsion can overthrow. I have recently\r\nbeen advised that in one county of a certain State three districts for the\r\nelection of members of the legislature are constituted as follows: One has\r\n65,000 population, one 15,000, and one 10,000, while in another county\r\ndetached, noncontiguous sections have been united to make a legislative\r\ndistrict. These methods have already found effective application to the\r\nchoice of Senators and Representatives in Congress, and now an evil start\r\nhas been made in the direction of applying them to the choice by the States\r\nof electors of President and Vice-President. If this is accomplished, we\r\nshall then have the three great departments of the Government in the grasp\r\nof the \"gerrymander,\" the legislative and executive directly and the\r\njudiciary indirectly through the power of appointment.\r\n\r\nAn election implies a body of electors having prescribed qualifications,\r\neach one of whom has an equal value and influence in determining the\r\nresult. So when the Constitution provides that \"each State shall appoint\"\r\n(elect), \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of\r\nelectors,\" etc., an unrestricted power was not given to the legislatures in\r\nthe selection of the methods to be used. \"A republican form of government\"\r\nis guaranteed by the Constitution to each State, and the power given by the\r\nsame instrument to the legislatures of the States to prescribe methods for\r\nthe choice by the State of electors must be exercised under that\r\nlimitation. The essential features of such a government are the right of\r\nthe people to choose their own officers and the nearest practicable\r\nequality of value in the suffrages given in determining that choice.\r\n\r\nIt will not be claimed that the power given to the legislature would\r\nsupport a law providing that the persons receiving the smallest vote should\r\nbe the electors or a law that all the electors should be chosen by the\r\nvoters of a single Congressional district. The State is to choose, and\r\nfinder the pretense of regulating methods the legislature can neither vest\r\nthe right of choice elsewhere nor adopt methods not conformable to\r\nrepublican institutions. It is not my purpose here to discuss the question\r\nwhether a choice by the legislature or by the voters of equal single\r\ndistricts is a choice by the State, but only to recommend such regulation\r\nof this matter by constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity and\r\nprevent that disgraceful partisan jugglery to which such a liberty of\r\nchoice, if it exists, offers a temptation.\r\n\r\nNothing just now is more important than to provide every guaranty for the\r\nabsolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the respective\r\nStates of all the officers of the National Government, whether that\r\nsuffrage is applied directly, as in the choice of members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, or indirectly, as in the choice of Senators and electors\r\nof President. Respect for public officers and obedience to law will not\r\ncease to be the characteristics of our people until our elections cease to\r\ndeclare the will of majorities fairly ascertained without fraud,\r\nsuppression, or gerrymander. If I were called upon to declare wherein our\r\nchief national danger lies, I should say without hesitation in the\r\noverthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of the\r\npopular suffrage. That there is a real danger here all must agree; but the\r\nenergies of those who see it have been chiefly expended in trying to fix\r\nresponsibility upon the opposite party rather than in efforts to make such\r\npractices impossible by either party.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive debate\r\nwhile we take by consent one step in the direction of reform by eliminating\r\nthe gerrymander, which has been denounced by all parties as an influence in\r\nthe selection of electors of President and members of Congress? All the\r\nStates have, acting freely and separately, determined that the choice of\r\nelectors by a general ticket is the wisest and safest method, and it would\r\nseem there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment making that\r\nmethod permanent. If a legislature chosen in one year upon purely local\r\nquestions should, pending a Presidential contest, meet, rescind the law for\r\na choice upon a general ticket, and provide for the choice of electors by\r\nthe legislature, and this trick should determine the result, it is not too\r\nmuch to say that the public peace might be seriously and widely\r\nendangered.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the \"gerrymander\" as affecting the method of selecting\r\nelectors of President by Congressional districts, but the primary intent\r\nand effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the selection\r\nof members of the House of Representatives. The power of Congress is ample\r\nto deal with this threatening and intolerable abuse. The unfailing test of\r\nsincerity in election reform will be found in a willingness to confer as to\r\nremedies and to put into force such measures as will most effectually\r\npreserve the right of the people to free and equal representation.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in the last Congress to bring to bear the\r\nconstitutional powers of the General Government for the correction of fraud\r\nagainst the suffrage. It is important to know whether the opposition to\r\nsuch measures is really rested in particular features supposed to be\r\nobjectionable or includes any proposition to give to the election laws of\r\nthe United States adequacy to the correction of grave and acknowledged\r\nevils. I must yet entertain the hope that it is possible to secure a calm,\r\npatriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory changes as may\r\nbe necessary to secure the choice of the officers of the Government to the\r\npeople by fair apportionments and free elections.\r\n\r\nI believe it would be possible to constitute a commission, nonpartisan in\r\nits membership and composed of patriotic, wise, and impartial men, to whom\r\na consideration of the question of the evils connected with our election\r\nsystem and methods might be committed with a good prospect of securing\r\nunanimity in some plan for removing or mitigating those evils. The\r\nConstitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vested in\r\nthe Supreme Court if that method would give the best guaranty of\r\nimpartiality. This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiring\r\ninto the whole subject of the law of elections as related to the choice of\r\nofficers of the National Government, with a view to securing to every\r\nelector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an\r\napproach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as is attainable.\r\n\r\nWhile the policies of the General Government upon the tariff, upon the\r\nrestoration of our merchant marine, upon river and harbor improvements, and\r\nother such matters of grave and general concern are liable to be turned\r\nthis way or that by the results of Congressional elections and\r\nadministrative policies, sometimes involving issues that tend to peace or\r\nwar, to be turned this way or that by the results of a Presidential\r\nelection, there is a rightful interest in all the States and in every\r\nCongressional district that will not be deceived or silenced by the\r\naudacious pretense that the question of the right of any body of legal\r\nvoters in any State or in any Congressional district to give their\r\nsuffrages freely upon these general questions is a matter only of local\r\nconcern or control. The demand that the limitations of suffrage shall be\r\nfound in the law, and only there, is a just demand, and no just man should\r\nresent or resist it. My appeal is and must continue to be for a\r\nconsultation that shall \"proceed with candor, calmness, and patience upon\r\nthe lines of justice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty.\"\r\n\r\nTo the consideration of these very grave questions I invite not only the\r\nattention of Congress, but that of all patriotic citizens. We must not\r\nentertain the delusion that our people have ceased to regard a free ballot\r\nand equal representation as the price of their allegiance to laws and to\r\ncivil magistrates.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly rejoiced to notice many evidences of the increased\r\nunification of our people and of a revived national spirit. The vista that\r\nnow opens to us is wider and more glorious than ever before. Gratification\r\nand amazement struggle for supremacy as we contemplate the population,\r\nwealth, and moral strength of our country. A trust momentous in its\r\ninfluence upon our people and upon the world is for a brief time committed\r\nto us, and we must not be faithless to its first condition--the defense of\r\nthe free and equal influence of the people in the choice of public officers\r\nand in the control of public affairs.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nBenjamin Harrison\r\nDecember 6, 1892\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn submitting my annual message to Congress I have great satisfaction in\r\nbeing able to say that the general conditions affecting the commercial and\r\nindustrial interests of the United States are in the highest degree\r\nfavorable. A comparison of the existing conditions with those of the most\r\nfavored period in the history of the country will, I believe, show that so\r\nhigh a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comforts of\r\nlife were never before enjoyed by our people.\r\n\r\nThe total wealth of the country in 1860 was $16,159,616,068. In 1890 it\r\namounted to $62,610,000,000, an increase of 287 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe total mileage of railways in the United States in 1860 was 30,626. In\r\n1890 it was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent; and it is estimated that\r\nthere will be about 4,000 miles of track added by the close of the year\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nThe official returns of the Eleventh Census and those of the Tenth Census\r\nfor seventy-five leading cities furnish the basis for the following\r\ncomparisons:\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the capital invested in manufacturing was $1,232,839,670.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the capital invested in manufacturing was $2,900,735,884.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the number of employees was 1,301,388.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the number of employees was 2,251,134.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the wages earned were $501,965,778.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the wages earned were $1,221,170,454.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the value of the product was $2,711,579,899.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the value of the product was $4,860,286,837.\r\n\r\nI am informed by the Superintendent of the Census that the omission of\r\ncertain industries in 1880 which were included in 1890 accounts in part for\r\nthe remarkable increase thus shown, but after making full allowance for\r\ndifferences of method and deducting the returns for all industries not\r\nincluded in the census of 1880 there remain in the reports from these\r\nseventy-five cities an increase in the capital employed of $1,522,745,604,\r\nin the value of the product of $2,024,236,166, in wages earned of\r\n$677,943,929, and in the number of wage earners employed of 856,029. The\r\nwage earnings not only show an increased aggregate, but an increase per\r\ncapita from $386 in 1880 to $547 in 1890, or 41.71 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe new industrial plants established since October 6, 1890, and up to\r\nOctober 22, 1892, as partially reported in the American Economist, number\r\n345, and the extension of existing plants 108; the new capital invested\r\namounts to $40,449,050, and the number of additional employees to 37,285.\r\n\r\nThe Textile World for July, 1892, states that during the first six months\r\nof the present calendar year 135 new factories were built, of which 40 are\r\ncotton mills, 48 knitting mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk mills, 4 plush\r\nmills, and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in the\r\nSouthern States. Mr. A. B. Shepperson, of the New York Cotton Exchange,\r\nestimates the number of working spindles in the United States on September\r\n1, 1892, at 15,200,000, an increase of 660,000 over the year 1891. The\r\nconsumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2,396,000 bales, and in\r\n1892 2,584,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales. From the year 1869 to\r\n1892, inclusive, there has been an increase in the consumption of cotton in\r\nEurope of 92 per cent, while during the same period the increased\r\nconsumption in the United States has been about 150 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe report of Ira Ayer, special agent of the Treasury Department, shows\r\nthat at the date of September 30, 1892, there were 32 companies\r\nmanufacturing tin and terne plate in the United States and 14 companies\r\nbuilding new works for such manufacture. The estimated investment in\r\nbuildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June 30, 1893, if\r\nexisting conditions were to be continued, was $5,000,000 and the estimated\r\nrate of production 200,000,000 pounds per annum. The actual production for\r\nthe quarter ending September 30, 1892, was 10,952,725 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe report of Labor Commissioner Peck, of New York, shows that during the\r\nyear 1891, in about 6,000 manufacturing establishments in that State\r\nembraced within the special inquiry made by him, and representing 67\r\ndifferent industries, there was a net increase over the year 1890 of\r\n$30,315,130.68 in the value of the product and of $6,377,925.09 in the\r\namount of wages paid. The report of the commissioner of labor for the State\r\nof Massachusetts shows that 3,745 industries in that State paid\r\n$129,416,248 in wages during the year 1891, against $126,030,303 in 1890,\r\nan increase of $3,335,945, and that there was an increase of $9,932,490 in\r\nthe amount of capital and of 7,346 in the number of persons employed in the\r\nsame period.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six months of the year 1891 and the first six months of\r\n1892 the total production of pig iron was 9,710,819 tons, as against\r\n9,202,703 tons in the year 1890, which was the largest annual production\r\never attained. For the same twelve months of 1891-92 the production of\r\nBessemer ingots was 3,878,581 tons, an increase of 189,710 gross tons over\r\nthe previously unprecedented yearly production of 3,688,871 gross tons in\r\n1890. The production of Bessemer steel rails for the first six months of\r\n1892 was 772,436 gross tons, as against 702,080 gross tons during the last\r\nsix months of the year 1891.\r\n\r\nThe total value of our foreign trade (exports and imports of merchandise)\r\nduring the last fiscal year was $1,857,680,610, an increase of $128,283,604\r\nover the previous fiscal year. The average annual value of our imports and\r\nexports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was\r\n$1,457,322,019. It will be observed that our foreign trade for 1892\r\nexceeded this annual average value by $400,358,591, an increase of 27.47\r\nper cent. The significance and value of this increase are shown by the fact\r\nthat the excess in the trade of 1892 over 1891 was wholly in the value of\r\nexports, for there was a decrease in the value of imports of $17,513,754.\r\n\r\nThe value of our exports during the fiscal year 1892 reached the highest\r\nfigure in the history of the Government, amounting to $1,030,278,148,\r\nexceeding by $145,797,338 the exports of 1891 and exceeding the value of\r\nthe imports by $202,875,686. A comparison of the value of our exports for\r\n1892 with the annual average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows an\r\nexcess of $265,142,651, or of 34.65 per cent. The value of our imports of\r\nmerchandise for 1892, which was $829,402,462, also exceeded the annual\r\naverage value of the ten years prior to 1891 by $135,215,940. During the\r\nfiscal year 1892 the value of imports free of duty amounted to\r\n$457,999,658, the largest aggregate in the history of our commerce. The\r\nvalue of the imports of merchandise entered free of duty in 1892 was 55.35\r\nper cent of the total value of imports, as compared with 43.35 per cent in\r\n1891 and 33.66 per cent in 1890.\r\n\r\nIn our coastwise trade a most encouraging development is in progress, there\r\nhaving been in the last four years an increase of 16 per cent. In internal\r\ncommerce the statistics show that no such period of prosperity has ever\r\nbefore existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trade of the Great\r\nLakes in 1890 aggregated 28,295,959 tons. On the Mississippi, Missouri, and\r\nOhio rivers and tributaries in the same year the traffic aggregated\r\n29,405,046 tons, and the total vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit\r\nRiver during that year was 21,684,000 tons. The vessel tonnage entered and\r\ncleared in the foreign trade of London during 1890 amounted to 13,480,767\r\ntons, and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total for these two great\r\nshipping ports of 24,422,568 tons, only slightly in excess of the vessel\r\ntonnage passing through the Detroit River. And it should be said that the\r\nseason for the Detroit River was but 228 days, while of course in London\r\nand Liverpool the season was for the entire year. The vessel tonnage\r\npassing through the St. Marys Canal for the fiscal year 1892 amounted to\r\n9,828,874 tons, and the freight tonnage of the Detroit River is estimated\r\nfor that year at 25,000,000 tons, against 23,209,619 tons in 1891. The\r\naggregate traffic on our railroads for the year 1891 amounted to\r\n704,398,609 tons of freight, compared with 691,344,437 tons in 1890, an\r\nincrease of 13,054,172 tons.\r\n\r\nAnother indication of the general prosperity of the country is found in the\r\nfact that the number of depositors in savings banks increased from 693,870\r\nin 1860 to 4,258,893 in 1890, an increase of 513 per cent, and the amount\r\nof deposits from $149,277,504 in 1860 to $1,524,844,506 in 1890, an\r\nincrease of 921 per cent. In 1891 the amount of deposits in savings banks\r\nwas $1,623,079,749. It is estimated that 90 per cent of these deposits\r\nrepresent the savings of wage earners. The bank clearances for nine months\r\nending September 30, 1891, amounted to $41,049,390,08. For the same months\r\nin 1892 they amounted to $45,189,601,947, an excess for the nine months of\r\n$4,140,211,139.\r\n\r\nThere never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant or\r\nwhen wages were as high, whether measured by the currency in which they are\r\npaid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. It\r\nis true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is one\r\nof the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer can not produce\r\nupon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate production\r\nof the year, and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follows\r\noverproduction. But while the fact I have stated is true as to the crops\r\nmentioned, the general average of prices has been such as to give to\r\nagriculture a fair participation in the general prosperity. The value of\r\nour total farm products has increased from $1,363,646,866 in 1860 to\r\n$4,500,000,000 in 1891, as estimated by statisticians, an increase of 230\r\nper cent. The number of hogs January 1, 1891, was 50,625,106 and their\r\nvalue $210,193,925; on January 1, 1892, the number was 52,398,019 and the\r\nvalue $241,031,415. On January 1, 1891, the number of cattle was 36,875,648\r\nand the value $544,127,908; on January 1 ,1892, the number was 37,651,239\r\nand the value $570,749,155.\r\n\r\nIf any are discontented with their state here, if any believe that wages or\r\nprices, the returns for honest toil, are inadequate, they should not fail\r\nto remember that there is no other country in the world where the\r\nconditions that seem to them hard would not be accepted as highly\r\nprosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to exchange the returns\r\nof his labor for those of the American farmer and the Manchester workmen\r\ntheir wages for those of their fellows at Fall River.\r\n\r\nI believe that the protective system, which has now for something more than\r\nthirty years continuously prevailed in our legislation, has been a mighty\r\ninstrument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful\r\nagency in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the invasion of want.\r\nI have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to our working people\r\nrates of wages that would not only give daily bread but supply a\r\ncomfortable margin for those home attractions and family comforts and\r\nenjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are\r\nAmerican citizens--a part of the great people for whom our Constitution and\r\nGovernment were framed and instituted--and it can not be a perversion of\r\nthat Constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the\r\ncomfort, independence, loyalty, and sense of interest in the Government\r\nwhich are essential to good citizenship in peace, and which will bring this\r\nstalwart throng, as in 1861, to the defense of the flag when it is\r\nassailed.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective\r\ntariff. The result of the recent election must be accepted as having\r\nintroduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff,\r\nconstructed upon the lines of protection, is to be repealed and that there\r\nis to be substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference\r\nto revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the increase will keep\r\nopen an American mill or keep up the wages of an American workman, but that\r\nin every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring to the\r\nTreasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The\r\ncontention has not been between schedules, but between principles, and it\r\nwould be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into\r\nlegislation the principles advocated by it and the pledges given to the\r\npeople. The tariff bills passed by the House of Representatives at the last\r\nsession were, as I suppose, even in the opinion of their promoters,\r\ninadequate, and justified only by the fact that the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives were not in accord and that a general revision could not\r\ntherefore be undertaken.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the\r\nincoming Congress. It is matter of regret that this work must be delayed\r\nfor at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changes\r\nintroduces so much uncertainty that an amount, not easily estimated, of\r\nbusiness inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result. It\r\nis possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased revenues\r\nfrom customs duties, for our merchants will make cautious orders for\r\nforeign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions and the\r\nuncertainty as to when they will take effect. Those who have advocated a\r\nprotective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecasts of a\r\nchange of policy disappointed. If a system of customs duties can be framed\r\nthat will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd our\r\nwarehouses with foreign-made goods and at the same time keep our own mills\r\nbusy; that will give us an increased participation in the \"markets of the\r\nworld\" of greater value than the home market we surrender; that will give\r\nincreased work to foreign workmen upon products to be consumed by our\r\npeople without diminishing the amount of work to be done here; that will\r\nenable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to 100 per\r\ncent more in wages than is paid in the foreign mill, and yet to compete in\r\nour market and in foreign markets with the foreign producer; that will\r\nfurther reduce the cost of articles of wear and food without reducing the\r\nwages of those who produce them; that can be celebrated, after its effects\r\nhave been realized, as its expectation has been in European as well as in\r\nAmerican cities, the authors and promoters of it will be entitled to the\r\nhighest praise. We have had in our history several experiences of the\r\ncontrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff, but this\r\ngeneration has not felt them, and the experience of one generation is not\r\nhighly instructive to the next. The friends of the protective system with\r\nundiminished confidence in the principles they have advocated will await\r\nthe results of the new experiment.\r\n\r\nThe strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the\r\nemployees and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments have\r\nnot been favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of the effect\r\nupon wages of the protective system. The facts that his wages were the\r\nhighest paid in like callings in the world and that a maintenance of this\r\nrate of wages in the absence of protective duties upon the product of his\r\nlabor was impossible were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests.\r\nHe may now be able to review the question in the light of his personal\r\nexperience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If that\r\nexperience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby\r\nmaintained or increased, either absolutely or in their purchasing power,\r\nand that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country is\r\nincreased or even maintained, so that there are more or as many days' work\r\nin a year, at as good or better wages, for the American workmen as has been\r\nthe case under the protective system, everyone will rejoice. A general\r\nprocess of wage reduction can not be contemplated by any patriotic citizen\r\nwithout the gravest apprehension. It may be, indeed I believe is, possible\r\nfor the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign\r\nrival in many branches of production without the defense of protective\r\nduties if the pay rolls are equalized; but the conflict that stands between\r\nthe producer and that result and the distress of our working people when it\r\nis attained are not pleasant to contemplate. The Society of the Unemployed,\r\nnow holding its frequent and threatening parades in the streets of foreign\r\ncities, should not be allowed to acquire an American domicile.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments, which are\r\nherewith submitted, have very naturally included a resume of the whole work\r\nof the Administration with the transactions of the last fiscal year. The\r\nattention not only of Congress but of the country is again invited to the\r\nmethods of administration which have been pursued and to the results which\r\nhave been attained. Public revenues amounting to $1,414,079,292.28 have\r\nbeen collected and disbursed without loss from misappropriation, without a\r\nsingle defalcation of such importance as to attract the public attention,\r\nand at a diminished per cent of cost for collection. The public business\r\nhas been transacted not only with fidelity, but progressively and with a\r\nview to giving to the people in the fullest possible degree the benefits of\r\na service established and maintained for their protection and comfort.\r\n\r\nOur relations with other nations are now undisturbed by any serious\r\ncontroversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany and\r\nEngland relating to Samoan affairs, with England in relation to the seal\r\nfisheries in the Bering Sea, and with Chile growing out of the Baltimore\r\naffair have been adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere have been negotiated and concluded, under section 3 of the tariff\r\nlaw, commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the following\r\ncountries: Brazil, Dominican Republic, Spain for Cuba and Puerto Rico,\r\nGuatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain for certain West\r\nIndian colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras, and\r\nAustria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nOf these, those with Guatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain,\r\nNicaragua, Honduras, and Austria-Hungary have been concluded since my last\r\nannual message. Under these trade arrangements a free or favored admission\r\nhas been secured in every case for an important list of American products.\r\nEspecial care has been taken to secure markets for farm products, in order\r\nto relieve that great underlying industry of the depression which the lack\r\nof an adequate foreign market for our surplus often brings. An opening has\r\nalso been made for manufactured products that will undoubtedly, if this\r\npolicy is maintained, greatly augment our export trade. The full benefits\r\nof these arrangements can not be realized instantly. New lines of trade are\r\nto be opened. The commercial traveler must survey the field. The\r\nmanufacturer must adapt his goods to the new markets and facilities for\r\nexchange must be established. This work has been well begun, our merchants\r\nand manufacturers having entered the new fields with courage and\r\nenterprise. In the case of food products, and especially with Cuba, the\r\ntrade did not need to wait, and the immediate results have been most\r\ngratifying. If this policy and these trade arrangements can be continued in\r\nforce and aided by the establishment of American steamship lines, I do not\r\ndoubt that we shall within a short period secure fully one-third of the\r\ntotal trade of the countries of Central and South America, which now\r\namounts to about $600,000,000 annually. In 1885 we had only 8 per cent of\r\nthis trade.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics show the increase in our trade with the countries\r\nwith which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date when such\r\nagreements went into effect up to September 30, 1892, the increase being in\r\nsome almost wholly and in others in an important degree the result of these\r\nagreements:\r\n\r\nThe domestic exports to Germany and Austria-Hungary have increased in value\r\nfrom $47,673,756 to $57,993,064, an increase of $10,319,308, or 21.63 per\r\ncent. With American countries the value of our exports has increased from\r\n$44,160,285 to $54,613,598, an increase of $10,453,313, or 23.67 per cent.\r\nThe total increase in the value of exports to all the countries with which\r\nwe have reciprocity agreements has been $20,772,621. This increase is\r\nchiefly in wheat, flour, meat, and dairy products and in manufactures of\r\niron and steel and lumber. There has been a large increase in the value of\r\nimports from all these countries since the commercial agreements went into\r\neffect, amounting to $74,294,525, but it has been entirely in imports from\r\nthe American countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, india rubber,\r\nand crude drugs. The alarmed attention of our European competitors for the\r\nSouth American market has been attracted to this new American policy and to\r\nour acquisition and their loss of South American trade.\r\n\r\nA treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britain\r\nand the United States as to the killing of seals in the Bering Sea was\r\nconcluded on the 29th of February last. This treaty was accompanied by an\r\nagreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitration, and a\r\nvigorous effort was made during this season to drive out all poaching\r\nsealers from the Bering Sea. Six naval vessels, three revenue cutters, and\r\none vessel from the Fish Commission, all under the command of Commander\r\nEvans, of the Navy, were sent into the sea, which was systematically\r\npatrolled. Some seizures were made, and it is believed that the catch in\r\nthe Bering Sea by poachers amounted to less than 500 seals. It is true,\r\nhowever, that in the North Pacific, while the seal herds were on their way\r\nto the passes between the Aleutian Islands, a very large number, probably\r\n35,000, were taken. The existing statutes of the United States do not\r\nrestrain our citizens from taking seals in the Pacific Ocean, and perhaps\r\nshould not unless the prohibition can be extended to the citizens of other\r\nnations. I recommend that power be given to the President by proclamation\r\nto prohibit the taking of seals in the North Pacific by American vessels in\r\ncase, either as the result of the findings of the Tribunal of Arbitration\r\nor otherwise, the restraints can be applied to the vessels of all\r\ncountries. The case of the United States for the Tribunal of Arbitration\r\nhas been prepared with great care and industry by the Hon. John W. Foster,\r\nand the counsel who represent this Government express confidence that a\r\nresult substantially establishing our claims and preserving this great\r\nindustry for the benefit of all nations will be attained.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year a suggestion was received through the British minister\r\nthat the Canadian government would like to confer as to the possibility of\r\nenlarging upon terms of mutual advantage the commercial exchanges of Canada\r\nand of the United States, and a conference was held at Washington, with Mr.\r\nBlaine acting for this Government and the British minister at this capital\r\nand three members of the Dominion cabinet acting as commissioners on the\r\npart of Great Britain. The conference developed the fact that the Canadian\r\ngovernment was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange for\r\nthe concessions asked the admission of natural products. The statement was\r\nfrankly made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as\r\nagainst the mother country. This admission, which was foreseen, necessarily\r\nterminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchange\r\nof natural products would be almost wholly with the people of Canada. Some\r\nother topics of interest were considered in the conference, and have\r\nresulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundary\r\nand the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay adjacent to Eastport, Me., and in the\r\ninitiation of an arrangement for the protection of fish life in the\r\ncoterminous and neighboring waters of our northern border.\r\n\r\nThe controversy as to tolls upon the Welland Canal, which was presented to\r\nCongress at the last session by special message, having failed of\r\nadjustment, I felt constrained to exercise the authority conferred by the\r\nact of July 26, 1892, and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of St.\r\nMarys Falls Canal to cargoes in transit to ports in Canada. The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury established such tolls as were thought to be equivalent to\r\nthe exactions unjustly levied upon our commerce in the Canadian canals.\r\n\r\nIf, as we must suppose, the political relations of Canada and the\r\ndisposition of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged, a somewhat\r\nradical revision of our trade relations should, I think, be made. Our\r\nrelations must continue to be intimate, and they should be friendly. I\r\nregret to say, however, that in many of the controversies, notably those as\r\nto the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing interests on the Pacific, and\r\nthe canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain have continuously been\r\nthwarted or retarded by unreasonable and unfriendly objections and protests\r\nfrom Canada in the matter of the canal tolls our treaty rights were\r\nflagrantly disregarded. It is hardly too much to say that the Canadian\r\nPacific and other railway lines which parallel our northern boundary are\r\nsustained by commerce having either its origin or terminus, or both, in the\r\nUnited States. Canadian railroads compete with those of the United States\r\nfor our traffic, and without the restraints of our interstate-commerce act.\r\nTheir cars pass almost without detention into and out of our territory.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway brought into the United States from China and\r\nJapan via British Columbia during the year ended June 30, 1892, 23,239,689\r\npounds of freight, and it carried from the United States, to be shipped to\r\nChina and Japan via British Columbia, 24,068,346 pounds of freight. There\r\nwere also shipped from the United States over this road from Eastern ports\r\nof the United States to our Pacific ports during the same year 13,912,073\r\npounds of freight, and there were received over this road at the United\r\nStates Eastern ports from ports on the Pacific Coast 13,293,315 pounds of\r\nfreight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo, Jr., former chief of the Bureau of Statistics,\r\nwhen before the Senate Select Committee on Relations with Canada, April 26,\r\n1890, said that \"the value of goods thus transported between different\r\npoints in the United States across Canadian territory probably amounts to\r\n$100,000,000 a year.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no disposition on the part of the people or Government of the\r\nUnited States to interfere in the smallest degree with the political\r\nrelations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It is\r\ntime for us, however, to consider whether, if the present state of things\r\nand trend of things is to continue, our interchanges upon lines of land\r\ntransportation should not be put upon a different basis and our entire\r\nindependence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence as an outlet to the\r\nsea secured by the construction of an American canal around the Falls of\r\nNiagara and the opening of ship communication between the Great Lakes and\r\none of our own seaports. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our\r\ngreat natural trade advantages. We should withdraw the support which is\r\ngiven to the railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a traffic that\r\nproperly belongs to us and no longer furnish the earnings which lighten the\r\notherwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have been\r\ngiven to them. The subject of the power of the Treasury to deal with this\r\nmatter without further legislation has been under consideration, but\r\ncircumstances have postponed a conclusion. It is probable that a\r\nconsideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of the\r\narticle of the treaty of Washington relating to the transit of goods in\r\nbond is involved in any complete solution of the question.\r\n\r\nCongress at the last session was kept advised of the progress of the\r\nserious and for a time threatening difference between the United States and\r\nChile. It gives me now great gratification to report that the Chilean\r\nGovernment in a most friendly and honorable spirit has tendered and paid as\r\nan indemnity to the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who were\r\nkilled and to those who were injured in the outbreak in the city of\r\nValparaiso the sum of $75,000. This has been accepted not only as an\r\nindemnity for a wrong done, but as a most gratifying evidence that the\r\nGovernment of Chile rightly appreciates the disposition of this Government\r\nto act in a spirit of the most absolute fairness and friendliness in our\r\nintercourse with that brave people. A further and conclusive evidence of\r\nthe mutual respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the fact\r\nthat a convention submitting to arbitration the mutual claims of the\r\ncitizens of the respective Governments has been agreed upon. Some of these\r\nclaims have been pending for many years and have been the occasion of much\r\nunsatisfactory diplomatic correspondence.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored in every way to assure our sister Republics of Central\r\nand South America that the United States Government and its people have\r\nonly the most friendly disposition toward them all. We do not covet their\r\nterritory. We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting in our\r\ndealings with any of them, even the weakest. Our interests and our hopes\r\nfor them all lie in the direction of stable governments by their people and\r\nof the largest development of their great commercial resources. The mutual\r\nbenefits of enlarged commercial exchanges and of a more familiar and\r\nfriendly intercourse between our peoples we do desire, and in this have\r\nsought their friendly cooperation.\r\n\r\nI have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in the greatest\r\nsincerity, that we must insist upon a just responsibility for any injuries\r\ninflicted upon our official representatives or upon our citizens. This\r\ninsistence, kindly and justly but firmly made, will, I believe, promote\r\npeace and mutual respect.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Hawaii have been such as to attract an increased\r\ninterest, and must continue to do so. I deem it of great importance that\r\nthe projected submarine cable, a survey for which has been made, should be\r\npromoted. Both for naval and commercial uses we should have quick\r\ncommunication with Honolulu. We should before this have availed ourselves\r\nof the concession made many years ago to this Government for a harbor and\r\nnaval station at Pearl River. Many evidences of the friendliness of the\r\nHawaiian Government have been given in the past, and it is gratifying to\r\nbelieve that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very close\r\nrelations is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe friendly act of this Government in expressing to the Government of\r\nItaly its reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching of Italian subjects in\r\nNew Orleans by the payment of 125,000 francs, or $24,330.90, was accepted\r\nby the King of Italy with every manifestation of gracious appreciation, and\r\nthe incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the action of the French Government in proclaiming a\r\nprotectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africa\r\neastward of the San Pedro River, which has long been regarded as the\r\nsoutheastern boundary of Liberia, I have felt constrained to make protest\r\nagainst this encroachment upon the territory of a Republic which was\r\nrounded by citizens of the United States and toward which this country has\r\nfor many years held the intimate relation of a friendly counselor.\r\n\r\nThe recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders on\r\nthe Mexican frontier have afforded this Government an opportunity to\r\ntestify its good will for Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill the\r\nobligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing the evil\r\ndoers. The work of relocating the boundary of the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably.\r\n\r\nOur intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret,\r\nhowever, not to be able to report as yet the adjustment of the claims of\r\nthe American missionaries arising from the disorders at Ponape, in the\r\nCaroline Islands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjustment in view of\r\nrenewed and urgent representations to the Government at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the religious and educational establishments of American\r\ncitizens in Turkey has of late called for a more than usual share of\r\nattention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so beneficially\r\nprevailed is discernible and has called forth the earnest remonstrance of\r\nthis Government. Harassing regulations in regard to schools and churches\r\nhave been attempted in certain localities, but not without due protest and\r\nthe assertion of the inherent and conventional rights of our countrymen.\r\nViolations of domicile and search of the persons and effects of citizens of\r\nthe United States by apparently irresponsible officials in the Asiatic\r\nvilayets have from time to time been reported. An aggravated instance of\r\ninjury to the property of an American missionary at Bourdour, in the\r\nprovince of Konia, called forth an urgent claim for reparation, which I am\r\npleased to say was promptly heeded by the Government of the Porte.\r\nInterference with the trading ventures of our citizens in Asia Minor is\r\nalso reported, and the lack of consular representation in that region is a\r\nserious drawback to instant and effective protection. I can not believe\r\nthat these incidents represent a settled policy, and shall not cease to\r\nurge the adoption of proper remedies.\r\n\r\nInternational copyright has been extended to Italy by proclamation in\r\nconformity with the act of March 3, 1891, upon assurance being given that\r\nItalian law permits to citizens of the United States the benefit of\r\ncopyright on substantially the same basis as to subjects of Italy. By a\r\nspecial convention proclaimed January 15, 1892, reciprocal provisions of\r\ncopyright have been applied between the United States and Germany.\r\nNegotiations are in progress with other countries to the same end.\r\n\r\nI repeat with great earnestness the recommendation which I have made in\r\nseveral previous messages that prompt and adequate support be given to the\r\nAmerican company engaged in the construction of the Nicaragua ship canal.\r\nIt is impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of this great\r\nenterprise, and I hope that there may be time, even in this Congress, to\r\ngive to it an impetus that will insure the early completion of the canal\r\nand secure to the United States its proper relation to it when completed.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has been already advised that the invitations of this\r\nGovernment for the assembling of an international monetary conference to\r\nconsider the question of an enlarged use of silver were accepted by the\r\nnations to which they were addressed. The conference assembled at Brussels\r\non the 22d of November, and has entered upon the consideration of this\r\ngreat question. I have not doubted, and have taken occasion to express that\r\nbelief as well in the invitations issued for this conference as in my\r\npublic messages, that the free coinage of silver upon an agreed\r\ninternational ratio would greatly promote the interests of our people and\r\nequally those of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may\r\nbe accomplished by the conference. If any temporary check or delay\r\nintervenes, I believe that very soon commercial conditions will compel the\r\nnow reluctant governments to unite with us in this movement to secure the\r\nenlargement of the volume of coined money needed for the transaction of the\r\nbusiness of the world.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will attract especial interest\r\nin view of the many misleading statements that have been made as to the\r\nstate of the public revenues. Three preliminary facts should not only be\r\nstated but emphasized before looking into details: First, that the public\r\ndebt has been reduced since March 4, 1889, $259,074,200, and the annual\r\ninterest charge $11,684,469; second, that there have been paid out for\r\npensions during this Administration up to November 1, 1892,\r\n$432,564,178.70, an excess of $114,466,386.09 over the sum expended during\r\nthe period from March 1, 1885, to March 1, 1889; and, third, that under the\r\nexisting tariff up to December 1 about $93,000,000 of revenue which would\r\nhave been collected upon imported sugars if the duty had been maintained\r\nhas gone into the pockets of the people, and not into the public Treasury,\r\nas before. If there are any who still think that the surplus should have\r\nbeen kept out of circulation by hoarding it in the Treasury, or deposited\r\nin favored banks without interest while the Government continued to pay to\r\nthese very banks interest upon the bonds deposited as security for the\r\ndeposits, or who think that the extended pension legislation was a public\r\nrobbery, or that the duties upon sugar should have been maintained, I am\r\ncontent to leave the argument where it now rests while we wait to see\r\nwhether these criticisms will take the form of legislation.\r\n\r\nThe revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all sources\r\nwere $425,868,260.22, and the expenditures for all purposes were\r\n$415,953,806.56, leaving a balance of $9,914,453.66. There were paid during\r\nthe year upon the public debt $40,570,467.98. The surplus in the Treasury\r\nand the bank redemption fund passed by the act of July 14, 1890, to the\r\ngeneral fund furnished in large part the cash available and used for the\r\npayments made upon the public debt. Compared with the year 1891, our\r\nreceipts from customs duties fell off $42,069,241.08, while our receipts\r\nfrom internal revenue increased $8,284,823.13, leaving the net loss of\r\nrevenue from these principal sources $33,784,417.95. The net loss of\r\nrevenue from all sources was $32,675,972.81.\r\n\r\nThe revenues, estimated and actual, for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1893, are placed by the Secretary at $463,336,350.44, and the expenditures\r\nat $461,336,350.44, showing a surplus of receipts over expenditures of\r\n$2,000,000. The cash balance in the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year\r\nit is estimated will be $20,992,377.03. So far as these figures are based\r\nupon estimates of receipts and expenditures for the remaining months of the\r\ncurrent fiscal year, there are not only the usual elements of uncertainty,\r\nbut some added elements. New revenue legislation, or even the expectation\r\nof it, may seriously reduce the public revenues during the period of\r\nuncertainty and during the process of business adjustment to the new\r\nconditions when they become known. But the Secretary has very wisely\r\nrefrained from guessing as to the effect of possible changes in our revenue\r\nlaws, since the scope of those changes and the time of their taking effect\r\ncan not in any degree be forecast or foretold by him. His estimates must be\r\nbased upon existing laws and upon a continuance of existing business\r\nconditions, except so far as these conditions may be affected by causes\r\nother than new legislation.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, are\r\n$490,121,365.38, and the estimated appropriations $457,261,335.33, leaving\r\nan estimated surplus of receipts over expenditures of $32,860,030.05. This\r\ndoes not include any payment to the sinking fund. In the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary that the sinking-fund law be repealed I concur. The\r\nredemption of bonds since the passage of the law to June 30, 1892, has\r\nalready exceeded the requirements by the sum of $990,510,681.49. The\r\nretirement of bonds in the future before maturity should be a matter of\r\nconvenience, not of compulsion. We should not collect revenue for that\r\npurpose, but only use any casual surplus. To the balance of $32,860,030.05\r\nof receipts over expenditures for the year 1894 should be added the\r\nestimated surplus at the beginning of the year, $20,992,377.03, and from\r\nthis aggregate there must be deducted, as stated by the Secretary, about\r\n$44,000,000 of estimated unexpended appropriations.\r\n\r\nThe public confidence in the purpose and ability of the Government to\r\nmaintain the parity of all of our money issues, whether coin or paper, must\r\nremain unshaken. The demand for gold in Europe and the consequent calls\r\nupon us are in a considerable degree the result of the efforts of some of\r\nthe European Governments to increase their gold reserves, and these efforts\r\nshould be met by appropriate legislation on our part. The conditions that\r\nhave created this drain of the Treasury gold are in an important degree\r\npolitical, and not commercial. In view of the fact that a general revision\r\nof our revenue laws in the near future seems to be probable, it would be\r\nbetter that any changes should be a part of that revision rather than of a\r\ntemporary nature.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the Secretary purchased under the act of July\r\n14, 1890, 54,355,748 ounces of silver and issued in payment therefor\r\n$51,106,608 in notes. The total purchases since the passage of the act have\r\nbeen 120,479,981 ounces and the aggregate of notes issued $116,783,590. The\r\naverage price paid for silver during the year was 94 cents per ounce, the\r\nhighest price being $1.02 3/4 July 1, 1891, and the lowest 83 cents March\r\n21, 1892. In view of the fact that the monetary conference is now sitting\r\nand that no conclusion has yet been reached, I withhold any recommendation\r\nas to legislation upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War brings again to the attention of\r\nCongress some important suggestions as to the reorganization of the\r\ninfantry and artillery arms of the service, which his predecessors have\r\nbefore urgently presented. Our Army is small, but its organization should\r\nall the more be put upon the most approved modern basis. The conditions\r\nupon what we have called the \"frontier\" have heretofore required the\r\nmaintenance of many small posts, but now the policy of concentration is\r\nobviously the right one. The new posts should have the proper strategic\r\nrelations to the only \"frontiers\" we now have--those of the seacoast and of\r\nour northern and part of our southern boundary. I do not think that any\r\nquestion of advantage to localities or to States should determine the\r\nlocation of the new posts. The reorganization and enlargement of the Bureau\r\nof Military Information which the Secretary has effected is a work the\r\nusefulness of which will become every year more apparent. The work of\r\nbuilding heavy guns and the construction of coast defenses has been well\r\nbegun and should be carried on without check.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General is by law submitted directly to\r\nCongress, but I can not refrain from saying that he has conducted the\r\nincreasing work of the Department of Justice with great professional skill.\r\nHe has in several directions secured from the courts decisions giving\r\nincreased protection to the officers of the United States and bringing some\r\nclasses of crime that escaped local cognizance and punishment into the\r\ntribunals of the United States, where they could be tried with\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\nThe numerous applications for Executive clemency presented in behalf of\r\npersons convicted in United States courts and given penitentiary sentences\r\nhave called my attention to a fact referred to by the Attorney-General in\r\nhis report, namely, that a time allowance for good behavior for such\r\nprisoners is prescribed by the Federal statutes only where the State in\r\nwhich the penitentiary is located has made no such provision. Prisoners are\r\ngiven the benefit of the provisions of the State law regulating the\r\npenitentiary to which they may be sent. These are various, some perhaps too\r\nliberal and some perhaps too illiberal. The result is that a sentence for\r\nfive years means one thing if the prisoner is sent to one State for\r\nconfinement and quite a different thing if he is sent to another. I\r\nrecommend that a uniform credit for good behavior be prescribed by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI have before expressed my concurrence in the recommendation of the\r\nAttorney-General that degrees of murder should be recognized in the Federal\r\nstatutes, as they are, I believe, in all the States. These grades are\r\nrounded on correct distinctions in crime. The recognition of them would\r\nenable the courts to exercise some discretion in apportioning punishment\r\nand would greatly relieve the Executive of what is coming to be a very\r\nheavy burden--the examination of these cases on application for\r\ncommutation.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of claims pending against the Government in the Court of\r\nClaims is enormous. Claims to the amount of nearly $400,000,000 for the\r\ntaking of or injury to the property of persons claiming to be loyal during\r\nthe war are now before that court for examination. When to these are added\r\nthe Indian depredation claims and the French spoliation claims, an\r\naggregate is reached that is indeed startling. In the defense of all these\r\ncases the Government is at great disadvantage. The claimants have preserved\r\ntheir evidence, whereas the agents of the Government are sent into the\r\nfield to rummage for what they can find. This difficulty is peculiarly\r\ngreat where the fact to be established is the disloyalty of the claimant\r\nduring the war. If this great threat against our revenues is to have no\r\nother check, certainly Congress should supply the Department of Justice\r\nwith appropriations sufficiently liberal to secure the best legal talent in\r\nthe defense of these claims and to pursue its vague search for evidence\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows a most gratifying increase and a\r\nmost efficient and progressive management of the great business of that\r\nDepartment. The remarkable increase in revenues, in the number of\r\npost-offices, and in the miles of mail carriage furnishes further evidence\r\nof the high state of prosperity which our people are enjoying. New offices\r\nmean new hamlets and towns, new routes mean the extension of our border\r\nsettlements, and increased revenues mean an active commerce. The\r\nPostmaster-General reviews the whole period of his administration of the\r\noffice and brings some of his statistics down to the month of November\r\nlast. The postal revenues have increased during the last year nearly\r\n$5,000,000. The deficit for the year ending June 30, 1892, is $848,341 less\r\nthan the deficiency of the preceding year. The deficiency of the present\r\nfiscal year it is estimated will be reduced to $1,552,423, which will not\r\nonly be extinguished during the next fiscal year but a surplus of nearly\r\n$1,000,000 should then be shown. In these calculations the payments to be\r\nmade under the contracts for ocean mail service have not been included.\r\nThere have been added 1,590 new mail routes during the year, with a mileage\r\nof 8,563 miles, and the total number of new miles of mail trips added\r\nduring the year is nearly 17,000,000. The number of miles of mail journeys\r\nadded during the last four years is about 76,000,000, this addition being\r\n21,000,000 miles more than were in operation in the whole country in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe number of post-offices has been increased by 2,790 during the year, and\r\nduring the past four years, and up to October 29 last, the total increase\r\nin the number of offices has been nearly 9,000. The number of free-delivery\r\noffices has been nearly doubled in the last four years, and the number of\r\nmoney-order offices more than doubled within that time.\r\n\r\nFor the three years ending June 30, 1892, the postal revenue amounted to\r\n$197,744,359, which was an increase of $52,263,150 over the revenue for the\r\nthree years ending June 30, 1888, the increase during the last three years\r\nbeing more than three and a half times as great as the increase during the\r\nthree years ending June 30, 1888. No such increase as that shown for these\r\nthree years has ever previously appeared in the revenues of the Department.\r\nThe Postmaster-General has extended to the post-offices in the larger\r\ncities the merit system of promotion introduced by my direction into the\r\nDepartments here, and it has resulted there, as in the Departments, in a\r\nlarger volume of work and that better done.\r\n\r\nEver since our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebel\r\ncruisers during the War of the Rebellion the United States has been paying\r\nan enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in the shape of freight and\r\npassage moneys. Our grain and meats have been taken at our own docks and\r\nour large imports there laid down by foreign shipmasters. An increasing\r\ntorrent of American travel to Europe has contributed a vast sum annually to\r\nthe dividends of foreign shipowners. The balance of trade shown by the\r\nbooks of our custom-houses has been very largely reduced and in many years\r\naltogether extinguished by this constant drain. In the year 1892 only 12.3\r\nper cent of our imports were brought in American vessels. These great\r\nforeign steamships maintained by our traffic are many of them under\r\ncontracts with their respective Governments by which in time of war they\r\nwill become a part of their armed naval establishments. Profiting by our\r\ncommerce in peace, they will become the most formidable destroyers of our\r\ncommerce in time of war. I have felt, and have before expressed the\r\nfeeling, that this condition of things was both intolerable and\r\ndisgraceful. A wholesome change of policy, and one having in it much\r\npromise, as it seems to me, was begun by the law of March 3, 1891. Under\r\nthis law contracts have been made by the Postmaster-General for eleven mail\r\nroutes. The expenditure involved by these contracts for the next fiscal\r\nyear approximates $954,123.33. As one of the results already reached\r\nsixteen American steamships, of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 tons,\r\ncosting $7,400,000, have been built or contracted to be built in American\r\nshipyards.\r\n\r\nThe estimated tonnage of all steamships required under existing contracts\r\nis 165,802, and when the full service required by these contracts is\r\nestablished there will be forty-one mail steamers under the American flag,\r\nwith the probability of further necessary additions in the Brazilian and\r\nArgentine service. The contracts recently let for transatlantic service\r\nwill result in the construction of five ships of 10,000 tons each, costing\r\n$9,000,000 to $10,000,000, and will add, with the City of New York and City\r\nof Paris, to which the Treasury Department was authorized by legislation at\r\nthe last session to give American registry, seven of the swiftest vessels\r\nupon the sea to our naval reserve. The contracts made with the lines\r\nsailing to Central and South American ports have increased the frequency\r\nand shortened the time of the trips, added new ports of call, and sustained\r\nsome lines that otherwise would almost certainly have been withdrawn. The\r\nservice to Buenos Ayres is the first to the Argentine Republic under the\r\nAmerican flag. The service to Southampton, Boulogne, and Antwerp is also\r\nnew, and is to be begun with the steamships City of New York and City of\r\nParis in February next.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge the continuance of the policy inaugurated by this\r\nlegislation, and that the appropriations required to meet the obligations\r\nof the Government under the contracts may be made promptly, so that the\r\nlines that have entered into these engagements may not be embarrassed. We\r\nhave had, by reason of connections with the transcontinental railway lines\r\nconstructed through our own territory, some advantages in the ocean trade\r\nof the Pacific that we did not possess on the Atlantic. The construction of\r\nthe Canadian Pacific Railway and the establishment under large subventions\r\nfrom Canada and England of fast steamship service from Vancouver with Japan\r\nand China seriously threaten our shipping interests in the Pacific. This\r\nline of English steamers receives, as is stated by the Commissioner of\r\nNavigation, a direct subsidy of $400,000 annually, or $30,767 per trip for\r\nthirteen voyages, in addition to some further aid from the Admiralty in\r\nconnection with contracts under which the vessels may be used for naval\r\npurposes. The competing American Pacific mail line under the act of March\r\n3, 1891, receives only $6,389 per round trip.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been making within the last year, as I am informed, to\r\nestablish under similar conditions a line between Vancouver and some\r\nAustralian port, with a view of seizing there a trade in which we have had\r\na large interest. The Commissioner of Navigation states that a very large\r\nper cent of our imports from Asia are now brought to us by English\r\nsteamships and their connecting railways in Canada. With a view of\r\npromoting this trade, especially in tea, Canada has imposed a\r\ndiscriminating duty of 10 per cent upon tea and coffee brought into the\r\nDominion from the United States. If this unequal contest between American\r\nlines without subsidy, or with diminished subsidies, and the English\r\nCanadian line to which I have referred is to continue, I think we should at\r\nleast see that the facilities for customs entry and transportation across\r\nour territory are not such as to make the Canadian route a favored one, and\r\nthat the discrimination as to duties to which I have referred is met by a\r\nlike discrimination as to the importation of these articles from Canada.\r\n\r\nNo subject, I think, more nearly touches the pride, the power, and the\r\nprosperity of our country than this of the development of our merchant\r\nmarine upon the sea. If we could enter into conference with other\r\ncompetitors and all would agree to withhold government aid, we could\r\nperhaps take our chances with the rest; but our great competitors have\r\nestablished and maintained their lines by government subsidies until they\r\nnow have practically excluded us from participation. In my opinion no\r\nchoice is left to us but to pursue, moderately at least, the same lines.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits great progress in the\r\nconstruction of our new Navy. When the present Secretary entered upon his\r\nduties, only 3 modern steel vessels were in commission. The vessels since\r\nput in commission and to be put in commission during the winter will make a\r\ntotal of 19 during his administration of the Department. During the current\r\nyear 10 war vessels and 3 navy tugs have been launched, and during the four\r\nyears 25 vessels will have been launched. Two other large ships and a\r\ntorpedo boat are under contract and the work upon them well advanced, and\r\nthe 4 monitors are awaiting only the arrival of their armor, which has been\r\nunexpectedly delayed, or they would have been before this in commission.\r\n\r\nContracts have been let during this Administration, under the\r\nappropriations for the increase of the Navy, including new vessels and\r\ntheir appurtenances, to the amount of $35,000,000, and there has been\r\nexpended during the same period for labor at navy-yards upon similar work\r\n$8,000,000 without the smallest scandal or charge of fraud or partiality.\r\nThe enthusiasm and interest of our naval officers, both of the staff and\r\nline, have been greatly kindled. They have responded magnificently to the\r\nconfidence of Congress and have demonstrated to the world an unexcelled\r\ncapacity in construction, in ordnance, and in everything involved in the\r\nbuilding, equipping, and sailing of great war ships.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Secretary Tracy's administration several difficult\r\nproblems remained to be grappled with and solved before the efficiency in\r\naction of our ships could be secured. It is believed that as the result of\r\nnew processes in the construction of armor plate our later ships will be\r\nclothed with defensive plates of higher resisting power than are found on\r\nany war vessels afloat. We were without torpedoes. Tests have been made to\r\nascertain the relative efficiency of different constructions, a torpedo has\r\nbeen adopted, and the work of construction is now being carried on\r\nsuccessfully. We were without armor-piercing shells and without a shop\r\ninstructed and equipped for the construction of them. We are now making\r\nwhat is believed to be a projectile superior to any before in use. A\r\nsmokeless powder has been developed and a slow-burning powder for guns of\r\nlarge caliber. A high explosive capable of use in shells fired from service\r\nguns has been found, and the manufacture of gun cotton has been developed\r\nso that the question of supply is no longer in doubt.\r\n\r\nThe development of a naval militia, which has been organized in eight\r\nStates and brought into cordial and cooperative relations with the Navy, is\r\nanother important achievement. There are now enlisted in these\r\norganizations 1,800 men, and they are likely to be greatly extended. I\r\nrecommend such legislation and appropriations as will encourage and develop\r\nthis movement. The recommendations of the Secretary will, I do not doubt,\r\nreceive the friendly consideration of Congress, for he has enjoyed, as he\r\nhas deserved, the confidence of all those interested in the development of\r\nour Navy, without any division upon partisan lines. I earnestly express the\r\nhope that a work which has made such noble progress may not now be stayed.\r\nThe wholesome influence for peace and the increased sense of security which\r\nour citizens domiciled in other lands feel when these magnificent ships\r\nunder the American flag appear is already most gratefully apparent. The\r\nships from our Navy which will appear in the great naval parade next April\r\nin the harbor of New York will be a convincing demonstration to the world\r\nthat the United States is again a naval power.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Interior Department, always very burdensome, has been\r\nlarger than ever before during the administration of Secretary Noble. The\r\ndisability-pension law, the taking of the Eleventh Census, the opening of\r\nvast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the organization of Oklahoma, and\r\nthe negotiations for the cession of Indian lands furnish some of the\r\nparticulars of the increased work, and the results achieved testify to the\r\nability, fidelity, and industry of the head of the Department and his\r\nefficient assistants.\r\n\r\nSeveral important agreements for the cession of Indian lands negotiated by\r\nthe commission appointed under the act of March 2, 1889, are awaiting the\r\naction of Congress. Perhaps the most important of these is that for the\r\ncession of the Cherokee Strip. This region has been the source of great\r\nvexation to the executive department and of great friction and unrest\r\nbetween the settlers who desire to occupy it and the Indians who assert\r\ntitle. The agreement which has been made by the commission is perhaps the\r\nmost satisfactory that could have been reached. It will be noticed that it\r\nis conditioned upon its ratification by Congress before March 4, 1893. The\r\nSecretary of the Interior, who has given the subject very careful thought,\r\nrecommends the ratification of the agreement, and I am inclined to follow\r\nhis recommendation. Certain it is that some action by which this\r\ncontroversy shall be brought to an end and these lands opened to settlement\r\nis urgent.\r\n\r\nThe form of government provided by Congress on May 17, 1884, for Alaska was\r\nin its frame and purpose temporary. The increase of population and the\r\ndevelopment of some important mining and commercial interests make it\r\nimperative that the law should be revised and better provision made for the\r\narrest and punishment of criminals.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary shows a very gratifying state of facts as to\r\nthe condition of the General Land Office. The work of issuing agricultural\r\npatents, which seemed to be hopelessly in arrear when the present Secretary\r\nundertook the duties of his office, has been so expedited that the bureau\r\nis now upon current business. The relief thus afforded to honest and worthy\r\nsettlers upon the public lands by giving to them an assured title to their\r\nentries has been of incalculable benefit in developing the new States and\r\nthe Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Private Land Claims, established by Congress for the promotion\r\nof this policy of speedily settling contested land titles, is making\r\nsatisfactory progress in its work, and when the work is completed a great\r\nimpetus will be given to the development of those regions where unsettled\r\nclaims under Mexican grants have so long exercised their repressive\r\ninfluence. When to these results are added the enormous cessions of Indian\r\nlands which have been opened to settlement, aggregating during this\r\nAdministration nearly 26,000,000 acres, and the agreements negotiated and\r\nnow pending in Congress for ratification by which about 10,000,000\r\nadditional acres will be opened to settlement, it will be seen how much has\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe work in the Indian Bureau in the execution of the policy of recent\r\nlegislation has been largely directed to two chief purposes: First, the\r\nallotment of lands in severalty to the Indians and the cession to the\r\nUnited States of the surplus lands, and, secondly, to the work of educating\r\nthe Indian for his own protection in his closer contact with the white man\r\nand for the intelligent exercise of his new citizenship. Allotments have\r\nbeen made and patents issued to 5,900 Indians under the present Secretary\r\nand Commissioner, and 7,600 additional allotments have been made for which\r\npatents are now in process of preparation. The school attendance of Indian\r\nchildren has been increased during that time over 13 per cent, the\r\nenrollment for 1892 being nearly 20,000. A uniform system of school\r\ntext-books and of study has been adopted and the work in these national\r\nschools brought as near as may be to the basis of the free common schools\r\nof the States. These schools can be transferred and merged into the\r\ncommon-school systems of the States when the Indian has fully assumed his\r\nnew relation to the organized civil community in which he resides and the\r\nnew States are able to assume the burden. I have several times been called\r\nupon to remove Indian agents appointed by me, and have done so promptly\r\nupon every sustained complaint of unfitness or misconduct. I believe,\r\nhowever, that the Indian service at the agencies has been improved and is\r\nnow administered on the whole with a good degree of efficiency. If any\r\nlegislation is possible by which the selection of Indian agents can be\r\nwholly removed from all partisan suggestions or considerations, I am sure\r\nit would be a great relief to the Executive and a great benefit to the\r\nservice. The appropriation for the subsistence of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe\r\nIndians made at the last session of Congress was inadequate. This smaller\r\nappropriation was estimated for by the Commissioner upon the theory that\r\nthe large fund belonging to the tribe in the public Treasury could be and\r\nought to be used for their support. In view, however, of the pending\r\ndepredation claims against this fund and other considerations, the\r\nSecretary of the Interior on the 12th of April last submitted a\r\nsupplemental estimate for $50,000. This appropriation was not made, as it\r\nshould have been, and the oversight ought to be remedied at the earliest\r\npossible date.\r\n\r\nIn a special message to this Congress at the last session, I stated the\r\nreasons why I had not approved the deed for the release to the United\r\nStates by the Choctaws and Chickasaws of the lands formerly embraced in the\r\nCheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation and remaining after allotments to that\r\ntribe. A resolution of the Senate expressing the opinion of that body that\r\nnotwithstanding the facts stated in my special message the deed should be\r\napproved and the money, $2,991,450, paid over was presented to me May 10,\r\n1892. My special message was intended to call the attention of Congress to\r\nthe subject, and in view of the fact that it is conceded that the\r\nappropriation proceeded upon a false basis as to the amount of lands to be\r\npaid for and is by $50,000 in excess of the amount they are entitled to\r\n(even if their claim to the land is given full recognition at the rate\r\nagreed upon), I have not felt willing to approve the deed, and shall not do\r\nso, at least until both Houses of Congress have acted upon the subject. It\r\nhas been informally proposed by the claimants to release this sum of\r\n$50,000, but I have no power to demand or accept such a release, and such\r\nan agreement would be without consideration and void.\r\n\r\nI desire further to call the attention of Congress to the fact that the\r\nrecent agreement concluded with the Kiowas and Comanches relates to lands\r\nwhich were a part of the \"leased district,\" and to which the claim of the\r\nChoctaws and Chickasaws is precisely that recognized by Congress in the\r\nlegislation I have referred to. The surplus lands to which this claim would\r\nattach in the Kiowa and Comanche Reservation is 2,500,000 acres, and at the\r\nsame rate the Government will be called upon to pay to the Choctaws and\r\nChickasaws for these lands $3,125,000. This sum will be further augmented,\r\nespecially if the title of the Indians to the tract now Greet County, Tex.,\r\nis established. The duty devolved upon me in this connection was simply to\r\npass upon the form of the deed; but as in my opinion the facts mentioned in\r\nmy special message were not adequately brought to the attention of Congress\r\nin connection with the legislation, I have felt that I would not be\r\njustified in acting without some new expression of the legislative will.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Pensions, to which extended notice is\r\ngiven by the Secretary of the Interior in his report, will attract great\r\nattention. Judged by the aggregate amount of work done, the last year has\r\nbeen the greatest in the history of the office. I believe that the\r\norganization of the office is efficient and that the work has been done\r\nwith fidelity. The passage of what is known as the disability bill has, as\r\nwas foreseen, very largely increased the annual disbursements to the\r\ndisabled veterans of the Civil War. The estimate for this fiscal year was\r\n$144,956,000, and that amount was appropriated. A deficiency amounting to\r\n$10,508,621 must be provided for at this session. The estimate for pensions\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, is $165,000,000. The Commissioner\r\nof Pensions believes that if the present legislation and methods are\r\nmaintained and further additions to the pension laws are not made the\r\nmaximum expenditure for pensions will be reached June 30, 1894, and will be\r\nat the highest point $188,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nI adhere to the views expressed in previous messages that the care of the\r\ndisabled soldiers of the War of the Rebellion is a matter of national\r\nconcern and duty. Perhaps no emotion cools sooner than that of gratitude,\r\nbut I can not believe that this process has yet reached a point with our\r\npeople that would sustain the policy of remitting the care of these\r\ndisabled veterans to the inadequate agencies provided by local laws. The\r\nparade on the 20th of September last upon the streets of this capital of\r\n60,000 of the surviving Union veterans of the War of the Rebellion was a\r\nmost touching and thrilling episode, and the rich and gracious welcome\r\nextended to them by the District of Columbia and the applause that greeted\r\ntheir progress from tens of thousands of people from all the States did\r\nmuch to revive the glorious recollections of the Grand Review when these\r\nmen and many thousand others now in their graves were welcomed with\r\ngrateful joy as victors in a struggle in which the national unity, honor,\r\nand wealth were all at issue.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I called attention to the fact that some\r\nlegislative action was necessary in order to protect the interests of the\r\nGovernment in its relations with the Union Pacific Railway. The\r\nCommissioner of Railroads has submitted a very full report, giving exact\r\ninformation as to the debt, the liens upon the company's property, and its\r\nresources. We must deal with the question as we find it and take that\r\ncourse which will under existing conditions best secure the interests of\r\nthe United States. I recommended in my last annual message that a\r\ncommission be appointed to deal with this question, and I renew that\r\nrecommendation and suggest that the commission be given full power.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of Agriculture contains not only a most\r\ninteresting statement of the progressive and valuable work done under the\r\nadministration of Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for the enlarged\r\nusefulness of this important Department. In the successful efforts to break\r\ndown the restrictions to the free introduction of our meat products in the\r\ncountries of Europe the Secretary has been untiring from the first,\r\nstimulating and aiding all other Government officers at home and abroad\r\nwhose official duties enabled them to participate in the work. The total\r\ntrade in hog products with Europe in May, 1892, amounted to 82,000,000\r\npounds, against 46,900,000 in the same month of 1891; in June, 1892, the\r\nexport aggregated 85,700,000 pounds, against 46,500,000 pounds in the same\r\nmonth of the previous year; in July there was an increase of 41 per cent\r\nand in August of 55 per cent over the corresponding months of 1891. Over\r\n40,000,000 pounds of inspected pork have been exported since the law was\r\nput into operation, and a comparison of the four months of May, June, July,\r\nand August, 1892, with the same months of 1891 shows an increase in the\r\nnumber of pounds of our export of pork products of 62 per cent and an\r\nincrease in value of 66 1/2 per cent. The exports of dressed beef increased\r\nfrom 137,900,000 pounds in 1889 to 220,500,000 pounds in 1892 or about 60\r\nper cent. During the past year there have been exported 394,607 head of\r\nlive cattle, as against 205,786 exported in 1889. This increased\r\nexportation has been largely promoted by the inspection authorized by law\r\nand the faithful efforts of the Secretary and his efficient subordinates to\r\nmake that inspection thorough and to carefully exclude from all cargoes\r\ndiseased or suspected cattle. The requirement of the English regulations\r\nthat live cattle arriving from the United States must be slaughtered at the\r\ndocks had its origin in the claim that pleuro-pneumonia existed among\r\nAmerican cattle and that the existence of the disease could only certainly\r\nbe determined by a post mortem inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has labored with great energy and\r\nfaithfulness to extirpate this disease, and on the 26th day of September\r\nlast a public announcement was made by the Secretary that the disease no\r\nlonger existed anywhere within the United States. He is entirely satisfied\r\nafter the most searching inquiry that this statement was justified, and\r\nthat by a continuance of the inspection and quarantine now required of\r\ncattle brought into this country the disease can be prevented from again\r\ngetting any foothold. The value to the cattle industry of the United States\r\nof this achievement can hardly be estimated. We can not, perhaps, at once\r\ninsist that this evidence shall be accepted as satisfactory by other\r\ncountries; but if the present exemption from the disease is maintained and\r\nthe inspection of our cattle arriving at foreign ports, in which our own\r\nveterinarians participate, confirms it, we may justly expect that the\r\nrequirement that our cattle shall be slaughtered at the docks will be\r\nrevoked, as the sanitary restrictions upon our pork products have been. If\r\nour cattle can be taken alive to the interior, the trade will be enormously\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAgricultural products constituted 78.1 per cent of our unprecedented\r\nexports for the fiscal year which closed June 30, 1892, the total exports\r\nbeing $1,030,278,030 and the value of the agricultural products\r\n$793,717,676, which exceeds by more than $150,000,000 the shipment of\r\nagricultural products in any previous year.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and a promising work for the benefit of the American farmer\r\nhas been begun through agents of the Agricultural Department in Europe, and\r\nconsists in efforts to introduce the various products of Indian corn as\r\narticles of human food. The high price of rye offered a favorable\r\nopportunity for the experiment in Germany of combining corn meal with rye\r\nto produce a cheaper bread. A fair degree of success has been attained, and\r\nsome mills for grinding corn for food have been introduced. The Secretary\r\nis of the opinion that this new use of the products of corn has already\r\nstimulated exportations, and that if diligently prosecuted large and\r\nimportant markets can presently be opened for this great American product.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Secretary for an enlargement of the work of the\r\nDepartment are commended to your favorable consideration. It may, I think,\r\nbe said without challenge that in no corresponding period has so much been\r\ndone as during the last four years for the benefit of American\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nThe subject of quarantine regulations, inspection, and control was brought\r\nsuddenly to my attention by the arrival at our ports in August last of\r\nvessels infected with cholera. Quarantine regulations should be uniform at\r\nall our ports. Under the Constitution they are plainly within the exclusive\r\nFederal jurisdiction when and so far as Congress shall legislate. In my\r\nopinion the whole subject should be taken into national control and\r\nadequate power given to the Executive to protect our people against plague\r\ninvasions. On the 1st of September last I approved regulations establishing\r\na twenty-day quarantine for all vessels bringing immigrants from foreign\r\nports. This order will be continued in force. Some loss and suffering have\r\nresulted to passengers, but a due care for the homes of our people\r\njustifies in such cases the utmost precaution. There is danger that with\r\nthe coming of spring cholera will again appear, and a liberal appropriation\r\nshould be made at this session to enable our quarantine and port officers\r\nto exclude the deadly plague.\r\n\r\nBut the most careful and stringent quarantine regulations may not be\r\nsufficient absolutely to exclude the disease. The progress of medical and\r\nsanitary science has been such, however, that if approved precautions are\r\ntaken at once to put all of our cities and towns in the best sanitary\r\ncondition, and provision is made for isolating any sporadic cases and for a\r\nthorough disinfection, an epidemic can, I am sure, be avoided. This work\r\nappertains to the local authorities, and the responsibility and the penalty\r\nwill be appalling if it is neglected or unduly delayed.\r\n\r\nWe are peculiarly subject in our great ports to the spread of infectious\r\ndiseases by reason of the fact that unrestricted immigration brings to us\r\nout of European cities, in the overcrowded steerages of great steamships, a\r\nlarge number of persons whose surroundings make them the easy victims of\r\nthe plague. This consideration, as well as those affecting the political,\r\nmoral, and industrial interests of our country, leads me to renew the\r\nsuggestion that admission to our country and to the high privileges of its\r\ncitizenship should be more restricted and more careful. We have, I think, a\r\nright and owe a duty to our own people, and especially to our working\r\npeople, not only to keep out the vicious, the ignorant, the civil\r\ndisturber, the pauper, and the contract laborer, but to check the too great\r\nflow of immigration now coming by further limitations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the World's Columbian Exposition has not yet been submitted.\r\nThat of the board of management of the Government exhibit has been received\r\nand is herewith transmitted. The work of construction and of preparation\r\nfor the opening of the exposition in May next has progressed most\r\nsatisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and magnificence that will\r\nworthily sustain the honor of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia is left by a decision of the supreme court of the\r\nDistrict without any law regulating the liquor traffic. An old statute of\r\nthe legislature of the District relating to the licensing of various\r\nvocations has hitherto been treated by the Commissioners as giving them\r\npower to grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating liquors and as\r\nsubjecting those who sold without licenses to penalties; but in May last\r\nthe supreme court of the District held against this view of the powers of\r\nthe Commissioners. It is of urgent importance, therefore, that Congress\r\nshould supply, either by direct enactment or by conferring discretionary\r\npowers upon the Commissioners, proper limitations and restraints upon the\r\nliquor traffic in the District. The District has suffered in its reputation\r\nby many crimes of violence, a large per cent of them resulting from\r\ndrunkenness and the liquor traffic. The capital of the nation should be\r\nfreed from this reproach by the enactment of stringent restrictions and\r\nlimitations upon the traffic.\r\n\r\nIn renewing the recommendation which I have made in three preceding annual\r\nmessages that Congress should legislate for the protection of railroad\r\nemployees against the dangers incident to the old and inadequate methods of\r\nbraking and coupling which are still in use upon freight trains, I do so\r\nwith the hope that this Congress may take action upon the subject.\r\nStatistics furnished by the Interstate Commerce Commission show that during\r\nthe year ending June 30, 1891, there were forty-seven different styles of\r\ncar couplers reported to be in use, and that during the same period there\r\nwere 2,660 employees killed and 26,140 injured. Nearly 16 per cent of the\r\ndeaths occurred in the coupling and uncoupling of cars and over 36 per cent\r\nof the injuries had the same origin.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Commission ask for an increased appropriation for needed\r\nclerical assistance, which I think should be given. I extended the\r\nclassified service March 1, 1892, to include physicians, superintendents,\r\nassistant superintendents, school-teachers, and matrons in the Indian\r\nservice, and have had under consideration the subject of some further\r\nextensions, but have not as yet fully determined the lines upon which\r\nextensions can most properly and usefully be made.\r\n\r\nI have in each of the three annual messages which it has been my duty to\r\nsubmit to Congress called attention to the evils and dangers connected with\r\nour election methods and practices as they are related to the choice of\r\nofficers of the National Government. In my last annual message I endeavored\r\nto invoke serious attention to the evils of unfair apportionments for\r\nCongress. I can not close this message without again calling attention to\r\nthese grave and threatening evils. I had hoped that it was possible to\r\nsecure a nonpartisan inquiry by means of a commission into evils the\r\nexistence of which is known to all, and that out of this might grow\r\nlegislation from which all thought of partisan advantage should be\r\neliminated and only the higher thought appear of maintaining the freedom\r\nand purity of the ballot and the equality of the elector, without the\r\nguaranty of which the Government could never have been formed and without\r\nthe continuance of which it can not continue to exist in peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is time that mutual charges of unfairness and fraud between the great\r\nparties should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess a desire\r\nfor pure and honest elections should be brought to the test of their\r\nwillingness to free our legislation and our election methods from\r\neverything that tends to impair the public confidence in the announced\r\nresult. The necessity for an inquiry and for legislation by Congress upon\r\nthis subject is emphasized by the fact that the tendency of the legislation\r\nin some States in recent years has in some important particulars been away\r\nfrom and not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. Is it\r\nnot time that we should come together upon the high plane of patriotism\r\nwhile we devise methods that shall secure the right of every man qualified\r\nby law to cast a free ballot and give to every such ballot an equal value\r\nin choosing our public officers and in directing the policy of the\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\nLawlessness is not less such, but more, where it usurps the functions of\r\nthe peace officer and of the courts. The frequent lynching of colored\r\npeople accused of crime is without the excuse, which has sometimes been\r\nurged by mobs for a failure to pursue the appointed methods for the\r\npunishment of crime, that the accused have an undue influence over courts\r\nand juries. Such acts are a reproach to the community where they occur, and\r\nso far as they can be made the subject of Federal jurisdiction the\r\nstrongest repressive legislation is demanded. A public sentiment that will\r\nsustain the officers of the law in resisting mobs and in protecting accused\r\npersons in their custody should be promoted by every possible means. The\r\nofficer who gives his life in the brave discharge of this duty is worthy of\r\nspecial honor. No lesson needs to be so urgently impressed upon our people\r\nas this, that no worthy end or cause can be promoted by lawlessness.\r\n\r\nThis exhibit of the work of the Executive Departments is submitted to\r\nCongress and to the public in the hope that there will be found in it a due\r\nsense of responsibility and an earnest purpose to maintain the national\r\nhonor and to promote the happiness and prosperity of all our people, and\r\nthis brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of the country will give us\r\na level from which to note the increase or decadence that new legislative\r\npolicies may bring to us. There is no reason why the national influence,\r\npower, and prosperity should not observe the same rates of increase that\r\nhave characterized the past thirty years. We carry the great impulse and\r\nincrease of these years into the future. There is no reason why in many\r\nlines of production we should not surpass all other nations, as we have\r\nalready done in some. There are no near frontiers to our possible\r\ndevelopment. Retrogression would be a crime.\r\n\r\nBENJ. HARRISON",
