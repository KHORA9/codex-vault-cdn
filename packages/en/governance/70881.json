They illumined my being, and\r\nmy life became inspired through association with the immortal Abraham\r\nLincoln and the great men of the anti-slavery conflict.\r\n\r\nI am unwilling to allow these reminiscences to go forth without giving\r\ncredit to my old friend Julius Chambers, for the valuable assistance he\r\nrendered in compiling them.\r\n\r\n                                                         [Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                  Abram J. Dittenhoefer]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HOW WE ELECTED\r\n                                LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n                           THE MAN--LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances brought to me personal knowledge of Mr. Lincoln for\r\nnearly four years. I had frequent interviews with him, and so was able\r\nto form a well-considered estimate of the great Emancipator’s character\r\nand personality.\r\n\r\nBorn in Charleston, South Carolina, of Democratic pro-slavery parents,\r\nI was brought in early youth to New York; and although imbued with the\r\nsentiments and antipathies of my Southern environment, I soon became\r\nknown as a Southerner with Northern principles. At that time there were\r\nmany Northern men with Southern principles.\r\n\r\nThe city of New York, as I discovered upon reaching the age of\r\nobservation, was virtually an annex of the South, the New York\r\nmerchants having extensive and very profitable business relations with\r\nthe merchants south of the Mason and Dixon line.\r\n\r\nThe South was the best customer of New York. I often said in those\r\ndays, “Our merchants have for sale on their shelves their principles,\r\ntogether with their merchandise.”\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident occurred to my knowledge which aptly illustrates\r\nthe condition of things in this pro-slavery city. A Southerner came to\r\na New York merchant, who was a dealer in brushes and toilet articles,\r\nand offered him a large order for combs. The New York merchant, as it\r\nhappened, was a Quaker, but this was not known to the Southerner. The\r\nlatter made it a condition, in giving this large order, that the Quaker\r\nmerchant should exert all his influence in favor of the South. The\r\nSoutherner wished to do something to offset the great agitation headed\r\nby the abolitionists which had been going on for years in the North\r\nfor the extinction of slavery in the South. The Quaker merchant coolly\r\nreplied that the South would have to go lousy for a long time before he\r\nwould sell his combs to them under any such conditions.\r\n\r\nAnother occurrence that took place at an earlier period still further\r\nillumines this intense pro-slavery feeling. When Wendell Phillips, to\r\nmy mind one of the greatest orators of America, delivered a radical\r\nand brilliant anti-slavery speech at the old Tabernacle, situated in\r\nBroadway below Canal Street, the hall was filled with pro-slavery\r\nshouters; they rotten-egged Phillips in the course of his address. With\r\nsome friends I was present and witnessed this performance.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen I was wavering in my fidelity to the principles of the\r\nDemocratic party, which, in the city of New York, was largely in favor\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nI had just graduated from Columbia College, which was then situated\r\nin what is now known as College Place, between Chambers and Murray\r\nstreets. At that time many of our prominent and wealthy families\r\nlived in Chambers, Murray, and Warren streets, and I frequently\r\nattended festivities held by the parents of the college boys in the\r\nold-fashioned mansions which lined those thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving college I became a student in the law office of\r\nBenedict & Boardman, occupying offices in Dey Street, near Broadway.\r\nAt that time the late John E. Parsons, a distinguished member of the\r\nNew York bar, was the managing clerk; and Charles O’Connor, the head of\r\nthe New York bar in that generation, and who, in later years, ran as an\r\nIndependent candidate for the Presidency, was connected with that firm\r\nas counsel.\r\n\r\nSitting one day at my desk, I took up a newspaper, and the debate\r\nbetween Judah P. Benjamin, the rabid but eloquent pro-slavery Senator\r\nfrom Louisiana, and Benjamin F. Wade, the free-soil Senator from Ohio,\r\nattracted my attention.\r\n\r\nBenjamin had made a strong address in defense of slavery when Wade\r\narose and replied. He began his reply with some bitter and memorable\r\nwords, words which completely changed my political views.\r\n\r\n“I have listened with intense interest,” said he, “as I always do\r\nto the eloquent speech of my friend, the Senator from Louisiana--an\r\nIsraelite with Egyptian principles.”\r\n\r\nMy father, who was a prominent merchant of New York in those days, and\r\nvery influential with the German population, had urged me to become a\r\nDemocrat, warning me that a public career, if I joined the Republican\r\nparty, would be impossible in the city of New York. I felt that he was\r\nright in that view, as the party was in a hopeless minority, without\r\napparent prospect of ever being able to elect its candidates.\r\n\r\nThis was absolutely plain from the fact that Tammany Hall controlled\r\nthe entire election machinery in this city, there being no law at that\r\ntime which required the registration of voters before Election Day.\r\nMoreover, the inspectors of election were Tammany heelers, without any\r\nRepublican representation on the election boards. In consequence,\r\nfraudulent voting prevailed to a large extent.\r\n\r\nAnd yet my convictions were irrevocably changed by the reading of\r\nWade’s speech in answer to Benjamin. It struck me with great force that\r\nthe Israelite Benjamin, whose ancestors were enslaved in Egypt, ought\r\nnot to uphold slavery in free America, and could not do so without\r\nbringing disgrace upon himself.\r\n\r\nHaving convinced my father that slavery should no longer be tolerated,\r\nhe abandoned his old political associations, cast his vote for Lincoln\r\nand Hamlin, and remained a Republican until his death.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, if I may anticipate, William M. Tweed, who had not\r\nyet become “Boss,” but who had great and powerful influence in Tammany\r\nHall, besought me to join Tammany, calling my attention to the fact\r\nthat the power of the Democratic party was supreme in the city of New\r\nYork, and that the organization needed some one to influence the German\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nHe gave me his assurance that if I came into Tammany Hall I should\r\nreceive prompt recognition, and in a few years undoubtedly would become\r\njudge of the Supreme Court; later on I might go still higher up. I\r\nthanked Mr. Tweed for his friendly interest in me, but told him that\r\nno political preferment could induce me to abandon my convictions and\r\nlead me to support slavery.\r\n\r\nWhen Tweed became the absolute “Boss” of Tammany, some years later,\r\nhe renewed his request that I should join Tammany Hall. Recurring to\r\nhis previous promise, he again urged me to become a member of his\r\norganization; again I refused.\r\n\r\nOne can hardly appreciate to-day what it meant to me, a young man\r\nbeginning his career in New York, to ally myself with the Republican\r\nparty. By doing so, not only did I cast aside all apparent hope of\r\npublic preferment, but I also subjected myself to obloquy from and\r\nostracism by my acquaintances, my clients, and even members of my own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI was about twenty years of age when the first Republican convention\r\nmet at Pittsburg. It succeeded the disruption of the old Whig party,\r\nthe latter losing in public esteem on account of its indifference\r\ntoward the slavery question.\r\n\r\nGen. John C. Fremont, known as the Pathfinder, was nominated for\r\nPresident, and William L. Dayton, of New Jersey, was nominated for\r\nVice-President. The appellation of Pathfinder was given to Fremont\r\nbecause in earlier years he had explored the then hardly known Western\r\nterritory, with the aid of scouts and pioneers, and had indicated\r\npasses and routes through the mountains.\r\n\r\nThough not yet of age, I stumped for Fremont and Dayton, making many\r\nspeeches during that memorable campaign, and participating in several\r\nbarbecues, which were then the usual accompaniment of a political\r\ncampaign. I was well received in the towns where I was scheduled to\r\nspeak. A military band and a citizens’ committee generally met me\r\nat the station, and escorted me through the streets to the hotel or\r\nprivate house in which it was arranged that I should stay.\r\n\r\nThe thrilling battle-cry of that campaign was, “Free Speech, Free Soil,\r\nFree Men, and Fremont!” These words were shouted at all public meetings\r\nand in all public processions, and were received with the wildest\r\nenthusiasm. Indeed, the cry was a stump speech in itself; it still\r\nthrills me as I write. Like the “Marseillaise,” it was a shout for\r\nfreedom set to music.\r\n\r\nFremont had served by appointment for a brief period as Senator from\r\nthe State of California. His popularity as a candidate was aided by the\r\nfact that his wife, Jessie Benton Fremont, was the brilliant daughter\r\nof Thomas H. Benton, who for thirty years was a Senator from Missouri;\r\nand who, in later years, published his well-known book, _Thirty\r\nYears in the United States Senate_. In the later part of his career,\r\nBenton, who had been a strong supporter of the “peculiar institution”\r\nin the South, became an opponent of the extension of slavery in new\r\nterritory. Mrs. Fremont was an important figure in that campaign; her\r\nname was always mentioned with great respect by the opposition speakers.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Civil War, President Lincoln, in appreciation of Fremont’s\r\nsplendid services in the exploration of the West and because he had\r\nbeen the first Republican candidate for President, appointed him\r\ncommander of a portion of the Federal forces. On August 31, 1861,\r\nFremont issued a military order emancipating the slaves of all persons\r\nin arms against the United States. This action did not meet with Mr.\r\nLincoln’s approval; he considered it premature, and perhaps he was\r\nright in that view; accordingly he directed that the proclamation\r\nshould be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI was afterward reconciled to Fremont’s defeat in 1856, for the reason\r\nthat, had he been elected, the probability is that Abraham Lincoln,\r\nthe greatest figure in American history, never would have attained the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nHere it may be of interest to record that in the convention of 1856,\r\nwhich nominated Fremont, Lincoln received one hundred and ten votes for\r\nthe Vice-presidency, while Mr. Dayton, the successful candidate, had\r\nonly a few more votes. Nevertheless, Lincoln did not achieve a national\r\nreputation until he engaged in the memorable Lincoln and Douglas\r\ndebates in Illinois.\r\n\r\nDuring the Fremont campaign I sometimes spoke in German, especially in\r\ntowns in which there was a large Teutonic population, and I was hoping\r\nthat I might influence the German population of New York, two-thirds of\r\nwhich had allied itself with the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe most memorable event in Mr. Lincoln’s career, after the Fremont\r\ncampaign, was his appearance in joint debate with Stephen A. Douglas,\r\nthen known as the “Little Giant,” during the months of August,\r\nSeptember, and October, 1858. The challenge came from Lincoln, in a\r\nletter of July 24th, proposing the joint meetings. Seven debates were\r\nsubsequently agreed upon to take place in Ottawa, Freeport, Jonesboro,\r\nCharleston, Galesburg, Quincy, and Alton. These debates attracted\r\ngreat attention in all parts of the country, and were fully reported\r\nby the New York and Chicago newspapers. Robert H. Hitt, who afterward\r\nbecame chargé d’affaires at Paris, and in later years chairman of the\r\nHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs, reported stenographically all the\r\nspeeches, and gave me a vivid impression of them.\r\n\r\nIn the opening address at Ottawa, the “Little Giant” explained clearly\r\nwhat he meant by the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which he had\r\nadvocated in the United States Senate for many years, and which by the\r\nFree Soil people of the North was looked upon as merely a blind to\r\ncover the extension of slavery in free territory.\r\n\r\nDouglas had introduced bills giving Statehood to the Territories of\r\nKansas and Nebraska, and commenting upon these bills he said it was not\r\nintended to legislate slavery into any State or Territory or to exclude\r\nit therefrom, but “to leave the people thereof entirely free to form\r\nand regulate their domestic institutions as they thought best, subject\r\nonly to the Federal Constitution.”\r\n\r\nNow in the North the agitation to prevent the extension of slavery in\r\nthose States was intense; indeed, as the question involved the repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited the extension of slavery\r\nin newly acquired territory and which had been on the statute-book for\r\nmany years, it became the great issue of the Republican party.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s speeches were filled with quaint phrases and interpolated\r\njests. The latter always were apt and calculated to keep his hearers,\r\nfriendly or antagonistic, in a good humor. In his Ottawa answer to\r\nDouglas’s opening speech Mr. Lincoln asserted that any attempt to show\r\nthat he (Lincoln) advocated “perfect social and political equality\r\nbetween the negro and the white man is only a specious and fantastic\r\narrangement of words, by which one might prove a horse-chestnut was a\r\nchestnut horse.”\r\n\r\nAll Lincoln demanded for the negro was the right to eat the bread which\r\nhis own hands had earned without leave of anybody.\r\n\r\nLincoln was fond of quoting from the Bible without mentioning the\r\nfact, whereas Douglas was often caught differing with the Scriptures.\r\nNaturally Lincoln took advantage of his political opponent’s lack of\r\nBiblical knowledge.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas, in the debate of July 16, 1858, said: “Mr. Lincoln tells\r\nyou in his speech made in Springfield, ‘A house divided against itself\r\ncannot stand. I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half\r\nslave, half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not\r\nexpect the house to fall; but I do expect it to cease to be divided. It\r\nwill become all one thing or all the other.’”\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas then proceeded to use as his keynote of his speech\r\nLincoln’s sentence: “A house divided against itself cannot stand,”\r\narguing eloquently and apparently quite unaware of its Biblical origin.\r\n\r\nReferring to Judge Douglas’s criticism of his expression, “A house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand,” Lincoln asked: “Does the judge\r\nsay it can stand? If he does, then it is a question of veracity not\r\nbetween him and me, but between the judge and an authority of somewhat\r\nhigher character.”\r\n\r\nLincoln’s fondness for scriptural stories and incidents is further\r\nillustrated when, having appointed a man to a judgeship who had been\r\nsuspected of having been connected with a certain secret organization\r\nwhich was opposed to Lincoln’s renomination, he was remonstrated with\r\nand his magnanimity criticized. He replied: “I suppose Judge ----,\r\nhaving been disappointed, did behave badly, but I have scriptural\r\nreasons for appointing him. When Moses was on Mount Sinai, getting a\r\ncommission for Aaron, that same Aaron was at the foot of the mountain\r\nmaking a false god for the people to worship. Yet Aaron got the\r\ncommission.”\r\n\r\nAs an answer to Douglas’s doctrine of popular sovereignty Lincoln said\r\nthat he could not understand why, in the Territories, any man should be\r\n“obliged to have a slave if he did not want one. And if any man wants\r\nslaves,” argued Lincoln, “all other citizens in the Territory have no\r\nway of keeping that one man from holding them.”\r\n\r\nHe denounced fiercely the scheme of the Southern slaveholders to annex\r\nCuba as a plan to increase the slave territory. It may be recalled that\r\nthe conference at Ostend during Buchanan’s administration was held for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nHorace White has published an admirable description of his tour with\r\nthese debaters. In a parade at Charleston thirty-two young ladies,\r\nrepresenting States of the Union, carried banners. This “float” was\r\nfollowed by a handsome young woman on horseback, holding aloft a burgee\r\ninscribed: “Kansas, I will be free!” Upon the side of the float was the\r\nlegend:\r\n\r\n    Westward the star of empire takes its way;\r\n    We girls link on to Lincoln, as our mothers did to Clay.\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas charged that these debates had been instituted for the\r\npurpose of carrying Lincoln into the United States Senate. Although\r\nLincoln denied this, the Democrats believed there was some foundation\r\nfor the assumption.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at Dayton was a particularly boisterous one. Elijah Parish\r\nLovejoy, a brother of the distinguished Owen Lovejoy, who was very\r\nprominent in the abolitionist agitation, had been assassinated there\r\nnineteen years before for his anti-slavery opinions, but neither of the\r\nspeakers referred to the fact.\r\n\r\nTo show the pro-slavery sentiment that dominated the entire Government\r\nat that time, the famous dictum of Chief-Justice Taney in the Dred\r\nScott decision that “a negro had no rights that a white man was bound\r\nto respect,” may appropriately be recalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                  LINCOLN’S INTRODUCTION TO THE EAST\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln made his first public appearance in New York at Cooper\r\nUnion on the night of the 27th of February, 1860. My anti-slavery\r\nattitude was strengthened by that wonderful speech.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with Abraham Lincoln began on the afternoon of that\r\nmemorable day. I was presented to him at his hotel, and I venture\r\nto hope that I made some impression on him. This may have been due\r\nto the fact that at an early age I had taken an active part in the\r\nRepublican campaigns, and had followed with close attention the Lincoln\r\nand Douglas debates as they were reported in the New York journals.\r\nConsequently I could talk intelligently of national politics.\r\n\r\nI was on hand early at the Institute that night, and, having a seat\r\nupon the platform, I was able to observe the manner of the orator as\r\nwell as to hear every word he uttered. The way in which he carried\r\nhimself before the large audience that filled every nook and corner of\r\nthat underground hall is engraven on my mind. He was a very homely man.\r\nIndeed, he often referred to his homeliness himself. His tall, gaunt\r\nbody was like a huge clothed skeleton. So large were his feet and so\r\nclumsy were his hands that they looked out of proportion to the rest of\r\nhis figure. No artistic skill could soften his features nor render his\r\nappearance less ungainly, but after he began to talk he was awkwardness\r\ndeified.\r\n\r\nIn repose, as I saw him on many subsequent occasions, his face seemed\r\ndull, but when animated it became radiant with vitalized energy.\r\n\r\nNo textual report of his Cooper Institute address can possibly give any\r\nidea of its great oratorical merits. Mr. Lincoln never ranted, but gave\r\nemphatic emphasis to what he wished especially to “put across” by a\r\nslowness and marked clearness of enunciation. His voice was unpleasant,\r\nalmost rasping and shrill at first. Perhaps this was due to the fact\r\nthat he found it necessary to force it. A little later, he seemed to\r\ncontrol his voice better, and his earnestness invited and easily held\r\nthe attention of his auditors.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the seven thousand words spoken by Mr. Lincoln on that\r\ngreat occasion would be a difficult task and could not be successfully\r\nattempted in these reminiscences. I will only state that his theme was\r\n“slavery as the fathers viewed it.” Its delivery occupied more than an\r\nhour, its entire purpose being to show that the fathers of the Republic\r\nmerely tolerated slavery where it existed, since interference with it\r\nwould be resisted by the South; moreover, recognition of the legality\r\nof slavery in those States had been the inducement offered to them to\r\nenter the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, however, indicated that he was unalterably and inflexibly\r\nopposed to the extension of slavery in territory in which it did not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln began with a quotation from one of Senator Douglas’s\r\nspeeches, in which the “Little Giant” asserted that the framers of the\r\nConstitution understood the slavery question as well as, or better\r\nthan, their descendants. He brilliantly traced the origin and growth of\r\ndemocracy under the various forms that preceded the final adoption of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nAs it appeared to an abolitionist in principle, the speaker handled\r\nthe slavery question somewhat cautiously, chiefly condemning the\r\ncontemplated repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and opposing the\r\nextension of slavery into Territories and States where it did not\r\nexist. The appeal that he made to the reason and the common sense\r\nof the Southerner was forcible. He denied that the Republicans of\r\nthe North were sectional, or that they blamed the present generation\r\nof the South for the existence of slavery. He went out of his way\r\nto condemn the John Brown raid, asserting that the Republican party\r\nhad no sympathy with that foolhardy enterprise. He compared the John\r\nBrown raid to the previous outbreak at Southampton, Virginia, under\r\nthe negro, Nat Turner, in which sixty white people, mostly women and\r\nchildren, were destroyed. He denounced the declaration of the Southern\r\npeople that Northern anti-slavery men had instigated the John Brown\r\nincursion at Harper’s Ferry, and he showed that the trial of John Brown\r\nat Charlestown proved the allegation to be utterly fallacious.\r\n\r\nThe sentences near the close of Mr. Lincoln’s address will serve as\r\nthe keynote upon which he subsequently based his candidacy for the\r\nPresidency in opposition to the extremely radical anti-slavery views of\r\nHorace Greeley and William H. Seward.\r\n\r\n“Wrong as we think slavery,” said Lincoln, “we can afford to let it\r\nalone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising\r\nfrom its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes\r\nwill prevent, allow it to spread in the national Territories and to\r\noverrun us here in these free States? Let us have faith that right\r\nmakes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we\r\nunderstand it.”\r\n\r\nThe reception of these closing words by former Whigs and partially\r\nconvinced Republicans who were in the audience can hardly be described\r\nas enthusiastic. Many of these men left the auditorium that night, as I\r\ndid, in a seriously thoughtful mood.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Lincoln was congratulated by many upon the “boldness”\r\nof his views. And, indeed, they seemed radical at a time when nearly\r\nevery prominent statesman of the country was “trimming” on the slavery\r\nquestion. The great Daniel Webster had ruined his political career some\r\nyears previously by trying to be “all things to all men” politically.\r\n\r\nWhen I called at Mr. Lincoln’s hotel the following morning, I found Mr.\r\nLincoln alone. The shouts of approbation of the previous night were\r\nstill ringing in my ears, but the figure of the awkward Illinoisan\r\nsuggested nothing in the way of public enthusiasm or personal\r\ndistinction. He then and there appeared as a plain, unpretentious man.\r\nI ventured to congratulate him upon the success of his speech, and\r\nhis face brightened. “I am not sure that I made a success,” he said,\r\ndiffidently.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the brief time I was with Mr. Lincoln in his\r\nhotel, together with two members of the Republican committee, there was\r\nonly a general conversation about the Douglas-Lincoln debates, and the\r\nintense anti-slavery agitation prevailing in the Kansas and Nebraska\r\nTerritories and in Illinois.\r\n\r\nA few days after that epoch-making speech a prominent Democratic\r\nacquaintance, who had often expressed to me in language of bitterness\r\nhis hatred of all people who opposed the South, assured me that Mr.\r\nLincoln’s speech had made him a Free-Soiler, although he had not\r\nbelieved it possible that such a change in his views could ever occur.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent speeches throughout New England Mr. Lincoln went to\r\ngreater lengths in his denunciation of slavery. At Hartford, on the 5th\r\nof March, he denounced slavery as the enemy of the free working-man;\r\na day later, at New Haven, he characterized slavery as “the snake in\r\nthe Union bed”; at Norwich, on the ninth of that month, he described\r\nDouglas’s popular sovereignty as “the sugar-coated slavery pill.”\r\n\r\nThese later speeches greatly strengthened the anti-slavery agitation\r\nthroughout the North, and went far to settle the opinions of the\r\nvoters, who were wavering between Douglas’s popular sovereignty and the\r\nultra radicalism of Garrison and Phillips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                    HOW LINCOLN WAS FIRST NOMINATED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention that convened in Chicago, May 16,\r\n1860, proved a complete refutation of the frequently expressed belief\r\nthat the new party had died with Fremont’s defeat in 1856. Some of the\r\nablest and most distinguished men in the country appeared as delegates\r\nand as candidates for nomination. During the four years following\r\nFremont’s defeat by James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, former minister to\r\nEngland, the Republican party had been strengthened by the affiliation\r\nof many Northern Democrats who were inclined to oppose the extension of\r\nslavery. The struggles to exclude the curse of slavery from Kansas and\r\nNebraska had agitated the entire country during these years, and had\r\nbrought many new voters into the ranks of the Republican party.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward was admittedly the great Republican leader and the\r\nablest champion of his party. His speech in the United States Senate\r\non the “Irrepressible Conflict” had made him famous all over the\r\ncountry, and he was constantly talked of by both friends and foes. At\r\nleast two-thirds of the delegates at the Chicago convention favored\r\nhis nomination, and even the majority of the delegates from Illinois,\r\nLincoln’s own State, while instructed to vote for “Honest Old Abe” as\r\nthe favorite son, passively favored Seward.\r\n\r\nIn the New York delegation was Tom Hyer, the noted champion\r\nprize-fighter of his generation. He bore the banner of the New York\r\nCity Republican Club, and was an ardent supporter of Seward. Being a\r\nman six feet two and a half inches in height, he presented an imposing\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Seward’s ambition was generally ascribed to an unhealed\r\nbreak between Horace Greeley, Thurlow Weed, and himself. These three\r\nmen, all eminent in their spheres, constituted what was known then\r\nas the “Republican Triumvirate,” or what would now be called the\r\n“Big Three.” This breach occurred in November, 1854, over five years\r\npreviously. Greeley resented the injustice that he believed had been\r\nmeted out to him, being sincerely of the opinion that Senator Seward\r\nhad deceived him, and this unfriendly feeling had fermented into a\r\nfully developed hatred.\r\n\r\nHis letter to Seward announcing “a dissolution of the political firm of\r\nSeward, Weed, and Greeley, by the withdrawal of the junior partner,”\r\nis a part of political history. It is a long epistle, covering more\r\nthan five pages in Greeley’s _Recollections of a Busy Life_, in which\r\nis recounted the writer’s career in New York, from his start as “a\r\npoor young printer” to his affiliations with the political powers of\r\nthe Empire State. While it contains kindly words for Thurlow Weed, it\r\nproclaims the severance of all relations with Seward. In conclusion, it\r\nacknowledges acts of kindness by his former partner in politics, and,\r\nreiterating that “such acts will be gratefully remembered, the writer\r\ntakes an eternal farewell.”\r\n\r\nIn the stormy days preceding the Chicago convention the New York\r\n_Tribune’s_ opposition to Seward’s nomination had been continuous. But\r\nI have always had an idea, based upon a study of the actual occurrences\r\nin the convention where I was a looker-on, and from my intimacy with\r\nMr. Greeley, that the factor which had the most to do with Seward’s\r\ndefeat was the fear of Henry S. Lane, Republican candidate for Governor\r\nof Indiana, and of Andrew G. Curtin, Republican candidate for Governor\r\nof Pennsylvania, that Seward could not carry these two States. This\r\nweakness would not only insure defeat of the Presidential ticket, but\r\nwould carry down with it the aspirations of these two Gubernatorial\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nI talked with both of these able politicians on the subject, and the\r\nreasons they gave for their opposition to Seward were that he had\r\nantagonized the Protestant element of the country and the remnants of\r\nthe old “Know Nothing party” by his advocacy, in a message to the New\r\nYork Legislature, of a division of the school funds between Catholic\r\nparochial schools and the common or public schools of the States in\r\nproportion to the number of Catholics and non-Catholics. How much\r\nground there was for the anxiety of Lane and Curtin I have never been\r\nable to settle in my mind. Whether they were unduly alarmed or not, the\r\ndissemination of these views among the delegates created a noticeable\r\nweakening on the part of Seward’s friends.\r\n\r\nThe battle in the convention was a contest of political giants. Thurlow\r\nWeed, to whom Lincoln afterward became greatly attached, was Seward’s\r\ndevoted and loyal friend and champion. He gallantly led the fight for\r\nhim, ably supported by Edwin D. Morgan, the war Governor of New York,\r\nand chairman, at that time, of the National Committee, and also by\r\nHenry J. Raymond, the distinguished founder of the New York _Times_,\r\nand in later years Lieutenant-Governor of the State of New York.\r\n\r\nBefore the convention was called to order at least eight candidates\r\nwere in the field; to enumerate them:\r\n\r\n    William H. Seward, of New York.\r\n    Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois.\r\n    Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania.\r\n    Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio.\r\n    Edward Bates, of Missouri.\r\n    William L. Dayton, of New Jersey.\r\n    Justice John McLean, of the Supreme Court.\r\n    Jacob Collamer, of Vermont.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ashman, of Massachusetts, was chosen permanent chairman of the\r\nconvention, and after the platform was read Joshua Giddings moved\r\nthat it should be amended by inserting a part of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. This was violently opposed by another delegate in a\r\nrather sarcastic speech, whereupon George William Curtis, one of the\r\ngreat orators of America, and at the time editor of _Harper’s Weekly_,\r\ngot the floor and in his mellifluous voice said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, have you dared to come to this convention to undo what your\r\nfathers did in Independence Hall?”\r\n\r\nCurtis’s speech carried the amendment.\r\n\r\nTo impress all wavering delegates, an imposing political parade through\r\nthe streets was organized by Seward’s friends. It was great in numbers\r\nand enthusiasm. Hundreds of marchers, among whom Tom Hyer, in his\r\nglossy silk hat, was a prominent figure, were drafted into the parade\r\nby the political wire-pullers, but it had no effect in determining the\r\nresult on the floor of the convention.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from my long political experience I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat these public parades, while imposing for the moment, have no\r\npermanent influence upon the voters. The mob of spectators along the\r\nstreets are there largely as a matter of curiosity, and are not to be\r\nswerved from their convictions by any mere spectacle.\r\n\r\nWhile this outside parade was being carried on, Lincoln’s friends\r\ndeveloped tremendous energy and skill in marshaling the delegates.\r\nAmong the leaders of the “rail-splitter’s” cause were Joseph Medill,\r\nthe celebrated editor of the Chicago _Tribune_, David Davis, the\r\nintimate friend of Lincoln, afterward appointed by him justice of\r\nthe United States Supreme Court; Norman B. Judd; and Leonard Swett,\r\nremarkable for his close resemblance to Lincoln.\r\n\r\nGreeley was an intense champion of Edward Bates, who had been a\r\nrepresentative from Missouri during the administration of John Quincy\r\nAdams.\r\n\r\nGreeley’s championship of Bates was remarkable for several reasons.\r\nBates was born in Virginia, he had been a lifelong slaveholder, and in\r\npolitics he was what was known as a “Silver-gray Whig.” Consequently he\r\nwas conservative on the slavery question, clinging to the doctrine of\r\nthe revolutionary sages that “slavery was an evil to be restricted,\r\nnot a good to be diffused.” Greeley insisted that the position that\r\nBates thus held made him essentially a Republican. While he believed\r\nthat Bates would poll votes even in the slave States, he was confident\r\nthat he would rally about him all that was left of the old Whig party.\r\n\r\nGreeley, regarding trouble with the Southern States as probably\r\ninevitable, yet believed that the nomination of Bates would check\r\nand possibly avert an open schism. He did not at the time avow these\r\nreasons for supporting Bates, but afterward frankly admitted them.\r\nWhile these views may have influenced his opposition to Seward’s\r\nnomination, there is no doubt in my mind but that the real reason of\r\nhis fight against Seward were the grounds hereinbefore stated.\r\n\r\nThe Free Soil element at Chicago was both prominent and aggressive. A\r\ncharacteristic anecdote is told of Greeley during a caucus at which a\r\nFree Soil member shouted, “Let us have a candidate, this time, that\r\nrepresents our advanced convictions against slavery.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” inquired Greeley, in his falsetto voice, as he rose to\r\nhis feet, “suppose each Republican voter in your State were to receive\r\na letter to-morrow advising him that he (the said voter) had just\r\nlost a brother living in the South, who had left to him a plantation\r\nstocked with slaves. How many of the two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nRepublicans would, in response, set free those slaves?”\r\n\r\n“I fear I could not stand that test myself,” was the rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“Then it is not yet time to nominate an abolitionist,” retorted\r\nGreeley, sitting down.\r\n\r\nThis is a good story, but if the incident took place at all it must\r\nhave occurred elsewhere than in the caucus of the New York delegation,\r\nfor the reason that Greeley, not being a delegate from the State of New\r\nYork, could not attend the caucus of that delegation. He was appointed\r\na delegate from Oregon, by the special request of the Republicans of\r\nthat State, and as such sat in the convention.\r\n\r\nSeward had all of the delegates from New York, Michigan, Massachusetts,\r\nand he counted many followers in other States.\r\n\r\nLincoln had a strong following from his own State, and on the first\r\nballot mustered one hundred and two votes out of a total of four\r\nhundred and sixty-six. Seward received one hundred and seventy-two\r\nand a half on the second ballot; then Cameron turned his votes over\r\nto Lincoln, and thirteen of the Bates delegates followed suit. On the\r\nthird ballot Lincoln’s vote had increased to two hundred and thirty-one\r\nand a half, while Seward’s was only one hundred and eighty. When the\r\nbreak started I turned to my neighbor in the gallery and remarked,\r\n“Seward is defeated; Lincoln will be nominated.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he objected; “this is only one delegation, and Seward’s friends\r\nare too devotedly attached to his fortunes. They will never go over to\r\nhis opponent.”\r\n\r\n“And what will Greeley do?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Greeley will be left with only his hatred,” he rejoined.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even as we were speaking, the tide had turned. Delegate after\r\ndelegate came over to Lincoln, and the final ballot gave him three\r\nhundred and fifty-four votes and the nomination. When the result was\r\nannounced there was an outbreak from the galleries which had been\r\npacked with Lincoln sympathizers, but the New York delegates sat silent\r\nand sullen in their seats. It seemed a long time, although it was\r\nreally only a few minutes, before William M. Evarts, the distinguished\r\nmember of the New York bar, who later became Secretary of State under\r\nPresident Hayes, and Senator from the State of New York, rose and\r\nmoved, presumably with Seward’s acquiescence, that Lincoln’s nomination\r\nbe made unanimous. Then the applause broke out again and this time it\r\nwas much more general and spontaneous.\r\n\r\nHannibal Hamlin, of Maine, was nominated for Vice-President\r\npractically without opposition. The singular coincidence that the last\r\nsyllable of Lincoln’s first name, “Abraham,” and the first syllable\r\nof his last name, “Lincoln,” form the name “Hamlin,” attracted wide\r\nattention at that time.\r\n\r\nA great many anti-slavery advocates in the North differed with Lincoln\r\nas regards his views on the grave question of the immediate extinction\r\nof slavery in the Southern States. They did not understand him.\r\n\r\nThey did not comprehend that he was at heart thoroughly imbued with the\r\nunrighteousness of property in human beings, but that he felt it was\r\ngood policy to go gradually, step by step, hoping to unite the entire\r\nNorth and so bring about the ultimate abolishment of slavery; whereas,\r\nif the policy for the immediate extinction of slavery should be adopted\r\nit must inevitably have disrupted the Republican party.\r\n\r\nI was present at that convention, not as a delegate, but as a\r\n“looker-on” and a student of American politics. I need not say that I\r\nlearned much about the finesse and spirit of compromise that enters\r\ninto all national conventions.\r\n\r\nFrom a brief conversation which I had with Mr. Greeley, I understood\r\nthat while he disclaimed having effected Seward’s defeat, he was only\r\nmoderately gratified at Lincoln’s nomination.\r\n\r\nIn his well-known volume of _Recollections_ he intimates that he\r\nexerted much less influence in bringing about Seward’s defeat than I\r\ngathered from the conversation I had with him on the morning following\r\nLincoln’s nomination.\r\n\r\nThe demand of the people of the North, where the Republican strength\r\nlay exclusively, was for a candidate who would appeal to both\r\nFree-Soilers and abolitionists. Between these factions there was an\r\nalmost impassable gulf.\r\n\r\nNow as the years have rolled on Lincoln has grown steadily in the love\r\nand admiration of the American people, and the unjust criticism which\r\nwas made by the abolitionists at the time of his nomination, namely,\r\nthat he did not favor the abolition of slavery in the States because\r\nhe was born in the South, is regarded with disdain. The abolitionists\r\nin their intemperate criticism used language, in discussing Lincoln,\r\nhardly less acrimonious than that employed by the “fire-eaters” of the\r\nSouth; but they had no recourse except to vote for him. Thus were added\r\nthousands of unwilling votes to swell the Lincoln aggregate in the\r\nNovember election.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic convention had convened at an earlier date in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, the city of my birth. After quarreling\r\nover a platform for a week, the convention was split by the withdrawal\r\nof the majority of the delegates of the slave States, following the\r\nadoption of the plank favoring the Douglas “popular sovereignty”\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nAfter fifty-seven ballots for President, in which Douglas had the\r\nmajority in every instance, but not the two-thirds required for\r\nnomination in Democratic conventions, the convention adjourned on\r\nMay 3, 1860, to reassemble at Baltimore, June 18. There, the places\r\nof the seceders having been filled, Douglas received one hundred and\r\nseventy-three and a half votes on the first ballot and one hundred\r\nand eighty-one and a half on the second, still lacking the vote of\r\ntwo-thirds of the three hundred and three delegates in convention. On\r\nmotion of Sanford E. Church, of New York, who, in later years, became\r\nchief-justice of the Court of Appeals of that State, he was declared\r\nthe nominee. Herschel V. Johnson, of Georgia, was named as candidate\r\nfor Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe remnant of the Charleston convention gathered itself together\r\nin a separate convention, also held in Baltimore, on the eleventh\r\nday of June. It adjourned on the 25th of that month, when John\r\nC. Breckenridge, of Kentucky,--at that time Vice-President under\r\nBuchanan--was unanimously named for President, with Gen. Joseph H.\r\nLane, of Oregon, as his running mate.\r\n\r\nIn the Charleston convention Benjamin F. Butler, of Massachusetts, who\r\nduring the Civil War became identified with the North and was made a\r\nmajor-general in the Union Army, cast a solitary vote for Jefferson\r\nDavis as the Democratic candidate for President.\r\n\r\nThe three-cornered contest that followed between Lincoln, Douglas,\r\nand Breckenridge is paralleled in American political history by the\r\nfamous campaign of 1824 when Jackson, Adams, Clay, and Crawford, all\r\nof the same party, were running for the Presidency. As none of the\r\nlatter received a majority of the electoral vote, the election, under\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution, was thrown into the House of\r\nRepresentatives, where John Quincy Adams received the nomination.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee went to Springfield to notify Mr. Lincoln of his\r\nnomination, Judge Kelly, of Pennsylvania, known, because of his\r\nservice of over thirty years in Congress, as the father of the House\r\nof Representatives, was one of the committee. The judge was unusually\r\nlarge in stature, and his great height attracted Mr. Lincoln, who, upon\r\nshaking hands with him, asked, “What is your height, Judge?”\r\n\r\n“About six feet three,” said Judge Kelly. “What is yours, Mr. Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n“Six feet four,” replied Lincoln, with a smile, pulling himself up to\r\nhis full stature.\r\n\r\n“Pennsylvania,” said Judge Kelly, “bows to Illinois. My dear man, for\r\nyears my heart has been aching for a President that I could ‘look up\r\nto,’ and I have found him in the land where we thought there was none\r\nbut ‘Little Giants.’”\r\n\r\nLincoln replied, “There is one man in this country who, though little\r\nin stature, is a giant in mind, and he has given me much hard work to\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s reply to the committee that visited Springfield on\r\nMay 19, to notify him of his nomination, and his formal letter of\r\nacceptance, dated May 23, avoided all reference to what Mr. Seward had\r\ndescribed as “the impending crisis.” In his letter Mr. Lincoln pledged\r\n“due regard to the rights of all States and Territories and people of\r\nthe nation, to the inviolability of the Constitution, and the perpetual\r\nunion, harmony, and prosperity of all.” This assurance satisfied\r\nneither slaveholders of the South nor anti-slave men of the North. This\r\nletter often rose to haunt Lincoln in the latter part of the war, after\r\nhe had issued the Emancipation Proclamation which gave freedom to all\r\nthe slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was in the office of the Springfield _Journal_ when he\r\nreceived the first notification of his nomination. After allowing the\r\nassembled people to congratulate him, he said, “There is a little woman\r\ndown at our house that would like to hear the news,” and he started at\r\nonce for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                     HOW LINCOLN WAS FIRST ELECTED\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after the nomination I went to Chicago and thence to\r\nSpringfield. When I called at the modest Lincoln home, in order to\r\noffer my congratulations, I found him eager to obtain every ray of\r\nlight upon the prospects of the coming campaign.\r\n\r\n“What are the chances of my election?” he asked, as he took my hand.\r\n\r\n“You are going to get the entire North,” I replied, “on account of the\r\nDemocratic division between Breckenridge and Douglas.”\r\n\r\n“That is my own way of calculating,” he assented, “but I am glad to get\r\nthe views of everybody of experience in political matters.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dittenhoefer is absolutely correct in his figuring,” put in a\r\nbystander, and the glimmer of a smile of satisfaction passed over\r\nMr. Lincoln’s rugged countenance. I stepped back and stood looking\r\nand wondering. Typically Western he seemed to be in face, figure,\r\nand dress. How would he bear himself if called upon to direct the\r\ndestinies of the Republic? Let me say frankly that, at this early day,\r\nno suspicion of his real greatness had ever entered my mind. I knew\r\nhe was an able man, and I was content to hope that he might be strong\r\nenough to cope with the coming crisis in national affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Republican campaign, which began in earnest by the middle of June\r\nand lasted until the night before election day in November, differed in\r\nmany respects from any other in my recollection.\r\n\r\nI believe that there was more sincerity of soul put into the efforts to\r\nwin by fair means than has appeared in more recent national contests.\r\n\r\nA few days before the election of 1860 I made a speech at Cooper\r\nInstitute, which began as follows:\r\n\r\n    “With banners waving and with bugle horns,\r\n    We are coming, Father Abraham, five hundred thousand strong,\r\n    One blast upon the bugle horn is worth a thousand men.”\r\n\r\nThis was repeated by numerous speakers on the stump throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMemories of these parades, stump speeches, and bonfires linger with me\r\nvividly. The marching clubs were called “Wide Awakes,” and upon the\r\noil-cloth cloaks, cut amply long in order to protect their wearers\r\nfrom the weather, the words “Wide Awake,” in tall, white letters, were\r\npainted. Each man carried a swinging torch which maintained an upright\r\nposition no matter how it was held. The campaign developed numerous\r\nparades of these “Wide Awakes” in cities and towns throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Committee was not in possession of large\r\nfunds, and each organization financed itself. It is doubtful if the\r\nNational Committee had more than $100,000 to spend, and most of this\r\nwent for printing and postage. There was no “yellow-dog fund” in those\r\ndays. Had it been necessary for Mr. Lincoln or his managers to raise a\r\nhalf-million dollars, or go down to defeat, Lincoln would have lost out.\r\n\r\nOur “infant industries” had not yet been developed and “brought to a\r\nhead by the poultice of protection.” The late Senator Hanna would have\r\nregarded the prospects of a successful campaign without contribution\r\nfrom the protected interests as exceedingly doubtful.\r\n\r\nI threw all my energy into this campaign, and, though young, I was\r\nfrequently making several speeches during a day and evening. I marched\r\nwith the “Wide Awakes,” and was sent to different parts of the State,\r\nwhere, with other speakers, I addressed large audiences. The temper of\r\nmy hearers was not always encouraging.\r\n\r\nI have always doubted whether Seward’s partisan adherents in central\r\nNew York gave really loyal support to Lincoln, since it continued\r\nto rankle in their breasts that the sentiment of two-thirds of the\r\nconvention, originally in favor of Seward, had been turned to Lincoln\r\nthrough the machinations of Horace Greeley, Reuben E. Fenton--afterward\r\nGovernor of the State of New York--and other prominent anti-Seward men.\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made by the Republicans to campaign in the Southern\r\nStates, where the breach existing between the Douglas and Breckenridge\r\nadherents was remorselessly unrelenting. The drift in those States\r\nwas naturally unanimously in favor of Breckenridge, and it was early\r\nrecognized that Douglas, though a Democrat, would not carry a single\r\nSouthern State.\r\n\r\nIn the North the contest lay between Lincoln and Douglas. Breckenridge\r\nand Bell counted comparatively few and scattered followers, and their\r\nnames awakened no enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas was one of the best types of the American aggressive\r\npolitician this country ever produced. I heard Douglas speak on several\r\noccasions. His figure was short and chunky, hardly measuring up to his\r\npopular title of the “Little Giant.” He was very eloquent, but his\r\ncampaign theme, “Popular Sovereignty,” was never a drawing-card in\r\nthe North, and the practical application of this doctrine was really\r\nrestricted to the Territories, including “Bleeding Kansas.” The many\r\nspeeches that Douglas made throughout the North only had the effect of\r\nconsolidating the opponents of “Squatter Sovereignty.”\r\n\r\nThe adoption by Southern States of the principle of “State rights,”\r\nwhich in effect was only another name for the right of secession, was\r\nthe reason advanced to justify the rebellion which broke out with such\r\nfury in later years; but the demand for the right to introduce slavery\r\ninto new territory was, in my opinion, the impelling reason that\r\nfinally made the Civil War inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn the free States the division of the popular vote was chiefly\r\nbetween Lincoln and Douglas, while the slave States were largely\r\nfor Breckenridge, with a minority for Bell, the “Silver-gray Whig”\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nThe totals in the two sections are interesting as matters of record:\r\n\r\n               LINCOLN    DOUGLAS    BRECKENRIDGE  BELL\r\nFree States    1,831,180  1,128,049  279,211       130,151\r\nSlave States      26,430    163,574  570,871       515,973\r\n               ---------  ---------  ------------  -------\r\nTotal          1,857,610  1,291,623  850,082       646,124\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had 180 electoral votes to 123 for all the other\r\ncandidates. Every free State, with the exception of New Jersey, went\r\nfor him, and even New Jersey gave him four votes, the three remaining\r\ngoing to the “Little Giant.” Breckenridge, with a much smaller popular\r\nvote than Douglas, had 72 electoral votes, while Douglas, with a larger\r\npopular vote, had only 12 in all.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Greeley accurately summed it up: “A united North succeeded over\r\na divided South; while in 1856 a united South triumphed over a divided\r\nNorth.”\r\n\r\nLet us remember that a majority of the members of the Supreme Court\r\nhad shown strong Southern proclivities; the Senate was also largely\r\nanti-Republican, and the House of Representatives had a very mixed\r\npolitical complexion, owing to the fact that many of its members had\r\nbeen chosen in the October election preceding the Presidential election.\r\n\r\nSuch was the national situation after the popular verdict had been\r\ndeclared in favor of Lincoln and Hamlin. The South could not reconcile\r\nitself to the result. Trouble was in the air, but the North did not yet\r\nrealize the inevitability of civil war.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, anxious winter for the President-elect, and the strain\r\nupon him then was even more noticeable than after he assumed the burden\r\nof his great office.\r\n\r\nHe delivered his pathetic farewell address to his neighbors and friends\r\nin Springfield on February 11, 1861, and the following extract is\r\nentitled to a place in this record:\r\n\r\n My friends: No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling\r\n of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these\r\n people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century,\r\n and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been\r\n born, and here one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when or whether\r\n I ever may return, with a task before me greater than that which\r\n rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being\r\n who ever attended him I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot\r\n fail. Trusting in Him who can go with me, and yet remain with you and\r\n be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be\r\n well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will\r\n commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\nMany of Mr. Lincoln’s neighbors were in tears. I was not at Springfield\r\non that day, but I heard directly from men who were present that the\r\npain of separation was keenly felt by all classes of society.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln left Springfield not to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                      THE JOURNEY TO THE CAPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trip from Springfield to Washington was one of continuous\r\nenthusiasm, the President-elect receiving an ovation at every city en\r\nroute. The first halt was made at Indianapolis, where he addressed a\r\nmeeting, at which the famous War-Governor Morton presided. On this\r\noccasion he declared that “the preservation of the Union rests entirely\r\nwith the people.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day he spoke before a joint meeting of the Indiana\r\nLegislature, choosing for his theme: “The Union, is it a marriage bond\r\nor a free-love arrangement?”\r\n\r\nWhen about to cross the Ohio River into Virginia, a slave State, he\r\ngave it as his opinion that devotion to the Constitution was equally\r\ngreat on both sides of the stream, and he went on to emphasize the\r\nright of the majority to rule.\r\n\r\nArriving at Cleveland, he made an address in which he referred to the\r\napprehended trouble as “altogether artificial, due only to differences\r\nin political opinion.” “Nothing,” he declared, “is going to hurt the\r\nSouth; they are citizens of this common country and we have no power to\r\nchange their conditions. What, then, is the matter with them? Why all\r\nthese complaints? Doesn’t this show how artificial is the crisis? It\r\nhas no foundation in fact. It can’t be argued up and it can’t be argued\r\ndown. Let it alone, and it will go down of itself.”\r\n\r\nThis would seem to show that Mr. Lincoln really believed that the\r\ntrouble in the South would blow over. How sadly he was mistaken! It was\r\nnot until he arrived in the East and learned from trustworthy sources\r\nof the danger confronting him between New York and Washington that he\r\naccepted the situation as it actually existed.\r\n\r\nBuffalo was the next stopping-place, and the mayor and a large\r\nassemblage welcomed the President-elect. The stability of the Union was\r\nthe speaker’s theme, but he reiterated that he relied more upon divine\r\nassistance than help from human hands and hearts.\r\n\r\nAt Albany Governor Morgan presided over a public meeting, at which\r\nLincoln again declared that he would be “President not of a party,\r\nbut of a nation.” Later in the day he delivered another address, in\r\nwhich he said that “the mightiest of tasks confronted the humblest of\r\nPresidents.”\r\n\r\nHe remained two days in New York City, where he delivered two\r\naddresses. To a large audience, over which the unsympathetic Democratic\r\nmayor, Fernando Wood, presided, Mr. Lincoln expressed his doubts as to\r\nthe situation in quaint language. He likened the Union to a ship and\r\nits traditions to the cargo, saying that he was willing and anxious to\r\nsave both the ship and cargo, but if not both, the cargo would have to\r\ngo overboard for the safety of the ship.\r\n\r\nI heard that address and it gave me the impression that Mr. Lincoln had\r\nbecome bolder in the expression of his feeling against the continuance\r\nof slavery in the South. To-day it recalls itself to me as being the\r\nfirst gleam of emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was more grave and serious than usual; his voice was harsh\r\nand his manner indicated either fatigue or anxiety regarding the\r\nfuture. I detected a decided change in Mr. Lincoln since seeing him at\r\nSpringfield; he was a man carrying a burden that grew heavier day by\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe journey toward Washington was resumed on February 21, a halt being\r\nmade at Trenton for the President-elect to address, separately, the\r\nSenate and the Assembly of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon the train reached Philadelphia, where a\r\nreception presided over by the mayor was tendered to him. In\r\nconsequence of reports of danger he was practically smuggled away from\r\nPhiladelphia, being hurried in a closed carriage to the old Prince\r\nStreet station, on South Broad Street, where an engine and one car\r\nwas waiting. This was run through to Baltimore and thence over the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio branch to Washington.\r\n\r\nA large number of citizens in Baltimore, not confined by any means\r\nto the mob, were bitterly hostile to “the Yankee President,” as they\r\nderisively described the man from Illinois. That the precautions\r\ntaken were justified was proven within two months by the murderous\r\nassault upon the Sixth Massachusetts regiment during its march through\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nA little over four years later, when Lincoln’s funeral cortège passed\r\nthrough Baltimore, a complete change of feeling had taken place. In the\r\nselfsame city which had been considered unsafe for President Lincoln to\r\npass through, the first great demonstration of grief occurred.\r\n\r\nThe President-elect arrived in Washington on February 27, and although\r\nno outward evidence of the coming storm was observable, there was an\r\nintense feeling of anxiety among all classes at the national capital;\r\nit must be remembered that most of the office-holders were Southerners\r\nand that the city was filled with residents sympathetic with the\r\nSouth. In a reply to a serenade at his hotel on the evening of February\r\n28, Mr. Lincoln lamented the misunderstanding that existed between the\r\npeople of the North and the South, and reiterated his determination to\r\nenforce equal rights under the Constitution to all citizens. He pledged\r\nan impartial administration of the law.\r\n\r\nI was present at the delivery of Lincoln’s inaugural address, a\r\nwonderful piece of English composition which will continue to live when\r\nthe monuments of bronze and marble erected to his memory have crumbled\r\nto dust. In it occur these unforgetable words:\r\n\r\n With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the\r\n right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive to finish\r\n the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him\r\n who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and orphan--to\r\n do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among\r\n ourselves, and with all nations.\r\n\r\nThe President impressed me as being very serious in manner. His voice\r\nsounded shrill, but he was talking at high pitch in order that he might\r\nbe heard by as many as possible of the immense crowd. The assemblage\r\nwas orderly, respectful, and attentive. Little by little his auditors\r\nwarmed toward him, until finally the applause became overwhelming,\r\nspontaneous, and enthusiastic. Then, for the first time, it dawned\r\nupon me that Lincoln was not only the strong man needed at this crisis\r\nof our national affairs, but one of the few great men of all time; and\r\nI may say safely that this conviction was shared by all within hearing\r\nof his voice.\r\n\r\nThirty-nine days later the cannon were booming at Fort Moultrie and\r\nFort Sumter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n                         STORIES AND INCIDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently the world is never weary of asking what was the true Abraham\r\nLincoln, and every side-light upon his character is significant.\r\n\r\nA man whom I knew well discovered the President at his office counting\r\ngreenbacks and inclosing them in an envelope. He asked Mr. Lincoln how\r\nhe could spare the time for such a task in the midst of the important\r\nduties that were pressing upon him.\r\n\r\nLincoln replied: “The President of the United States has a multiplicity\r\nof duties not specified in the Constitution or the laws. This is one\r\nof them. It is money which belongs to a negro porter from the Treasury\r\nDepartment. He is now in the hospital, too sick to sign his name, and\r\naccording to his wish I am putting a part of it aside in an envelope,\r\nproperly labeled, to save it for him.”\r\n\r\nAn eye-witness relates that one day while walking along a shaded path\r\nfrom the Executive Mansion to the War Office, he saw the tall form of\r\nthe President seated on the grass. He afterward learned that a wounded\r\nsoldier, while on his way to the White House seeking back pay and a\r\npension, had met the President and had asked his assistance. Whereupon\r\nMr. Lincoln sat down, looked over the soldier’s papers, and advised him\r\nwhat to do; he ended by giving him a note directing him to the proper\r\nplace to secure attention.\r\n\r\nDriving up to a hospital one day he saw one of the patients walking\r\ndirectly in the path of his team. The horses were checked none too\r\nsoon; then Mr. Lincoln saw that he was nothing but a boy and had been\r\nwounded in both eyes. He got out of the carriage and questioned the\r\npoor fellow, asking him his name, his service, and his residence.\r\n“I am Abraham Lincoln,” he said, upon leaving; and the sightless\r\nface lighted at the President’s words of sympathy. The following day\r\nthe chief of the hospital delivered to the boy a commission in the\r\nArmy of the United States as first lieutenant. The papers bore the\r\nPresident’s signature and were accompanied by an order retiring him on\r\nthree-quarters pay for the years of helplessness that lay before him.\r\n\r\n“Some of my generals complain that I impair discipline in the Army by\r\nmy pardons and respites,” Lincoln once said. “But it rests me, after a\r\nhard day’s work, if I can find some excuse for saving a man’s life, and\r\nI go to bed happy as I think how joyous the signing of my name will\r\nmake him and his family and his friends.”\r\n\r\nI once heard Mr. Lincoln telling a number of Congressmen in the\r\nanteroom of the White House that in the distribution of patronage care\r\nshould be taken of the disabled soldiers and the widows and orphans of\r\ndeceased soldiers, and these views were subsequently conveyed to the\r\nSenate in a message which contained the following language:\r\n\r\n Yesterday a little endorsement of mine went to you in two cases of\r\n postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the\r\n battles of the war. These cases occurring on the same day brought me\r\n to reflect more attentively than I had before as to what is fairly\r\n due in the dispensing of patronage to the men who, by fighting our\r\n battles, bear the chief burden of saving our country. My conclusion\r\n is that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the\r\n better right; and this is especially applicable to the disabled\r\n soldier and the deceased soldier’s family.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to consider here what would be Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nattitude toward the irrepressible conflict that has been raging with\r\nsuch fierceness all over the world, between capital and labor, and\r\nwhich is ever increasing in intensity. I quote the following extracts\r\nfrom Lincoln’s message to Congress as showing his views on that\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n It is not needed, not fitting here, that a general argument should be\r\n made in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point not so\r\n hackneyed to which I ask a brief attention--it is an effort to place\r\n capital on an equal footing with, if not above, labor in the structure\r\n of the Government. Capital is the fruit of labor, and could never have\r\n existed if labor had not existed. Labor is the superior of capital,\r\n and deserves much higher consideration.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the President’s sympathies were with\r\nstruggling labor, and against the powerful capitalists, and that he\r\nwould exercise his constitutional powers to promote the welfare of the\r\nlaboring class. That attitude is in keeping with the broad humanitarian\r\nprinciples that always influenced Mr. Lincoln’s actions.\r\n\r\nTruly, Lincoln’s great, tender heart was always open to the sufferings\r\nof humanity; certainly his sympathy was never branded by the\r\nlimitations of creed or dogma. He never became a member of any church,\r\nbut no one could doubt that he was a man of deep religious feeling.\r\nI remember on one occasion hearing him say, “Religion is a matter of\r\nfaith; all good men will be saved.” Judging by our standard of to-day,\r\nthis utterance would class him with the Unitarians.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, after he had become our President, he visited the\r\nFive Points Mission in New York, at that time a notorious slum, and\r\naddressed a number of children; while there he gave no intimation that\r\nhe was President of the United States. When he was leaving the teacher\r\nthanked him, and asked who he was. He simply answered, “Abraham\r\nLincoln, of Illinois.”\r\n\r\nI have spoken of seeing Lincoln smile, but I never remember hearing\r\nhim laugh heartily, even when he was convulsing every one about him\r\nwith one of his inimitably told stories. And yet he apparently enjoyed\r\nexciting the mirth of others, and to that extent, at least, he seemed\r\nto enter into the spirit of the comedy. Many of the great humorists of\r\nthe world have been men of melancholy mood, and both tears and laughter\r\nare based on the same precious essence.\r\n\r\nI was often in Washington in those days, and I recollect frequently\r\nseeing the great President walking on Pennsylvania Avenue, with “Little\r\nTad” clasping his hand. The fact that he took Tad with him on his\r\nimportant mission to Richmond, where he attended the conference with\r\nsome of the leaders of the Confederacy, shows the companionship and\r\nintense affection between the President and the son of his old age.\r\n\r\nOnce while Mrs. Lincoln was at Manchester, Vermont, she received a\r\nmessage from the President, saying, “All is well, including Tad’s pony\r\nand the goats.” A little later he asked her to tell “dear Tad that poor\r\nnanny-goat is lost.”\r\n\r\nI often saw the President sitting in the White House in carpet\r\nslippers, and wearing an old bombazine coat out at the elbows. Indeed,\r\nMr. Lincoln was not created to adorn fashionable society, and did\r\nnot care for it. Clothing never troubled him, while Mrs. Lincoln set\r\nmuch store upon appearances and was concerned over her husband’s\r\nindifference to them.\r\n\r\nThe severe trials which confronted him, greater than any other\r\nPresident encountered, and the heavy burden that rested on him, did not\r\nblunt his finer feelings.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with Mr. Lincoln, in which his visit to Richmond came\r\nup, I casually inquired what he thought should be done with Jefferson\r\nDavis at the end of the war, which appeared then to be approaching.\r\nAfter a moment’s deliberation his sad face brightened as he answered\r\nthat, if he had his way, he would let him die in peace on his Southern\r\nplantation. I remember well that at that time my interpretation of his\r\nwords was that he would not permit any punishment to be inflicted on\r\nJefferson Davis, unless it were absolutely demanded by the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of President Johnson’s administration, after the\r\ncollapse of the rebellion, Davis was captured and brought on habeas\r\ncorpus proceedings before a Virginia court and released on bail. Horace\r\nGreeley, Gerritt Smith, and other Northern anti-slavery men became\r\nsureties on the bail bond, but no proceedings were ever taken to\r\nbring Davis to trial. He was allowed to die in peace on his Southern\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nCan history show any thought more magnanimous in the life of a ruler\r\nor statesman than this? Lincoln urged Meade, after the battle of\r\nGettysburg to pursue Lee in retreat and with one bold stroke end the\r\nwar. The order was peremptory, but a friendly note was attached, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n The order I enclose is not of record. If you succeed, you need not\r\n publish the order. If you fail, publish it. Then, if you succeed, you\r\n will have all the credit of the movement. If not, I’ll take care of\r\n the responsibility.\r\n\r\nA striking example of the President’s unselfish refusal to use his\r\nofficial position for the advancement of any member of his family, is\r\nfound in his letter to General Grant, asking for a commission for his\r\nson, Robert.\r\n\r\n Please read and answer this letter as though I was not President, but\r\n only a friend. My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated\r\n at Harvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends. I do\r\n not wish to put him in the ranks, nor yet give him a commission to\r\n which those who have already served long are better entitled and\r\n better qualified to hold.\r\n\r\n Could he, without embarrassment to you or detriment to the service,\r\n go into your military family with some nominal rank; I, and not the\r\n public, furnishing his necessary means? If not, say so without the\r\n least hesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply interested\r\n that you shall not be encumbered as you can be yourself.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was famous for disposing of office-seekers without leaving\r\na sting behind. H. C. Whitney told this story to a friend of mine:\r\n\r\n“I had business in Washington in 1861 pertaining to the Indian service,\r\nand I remarked to Mr. Lincoln that, ‘Everything is drifting into the\r\nwar, and I guess you will have to put me in the Army.’ Lincoln smiled\r\nand said: ‘I’m making generals now. In a few days I’ll be making\r\nquartermasters, then I’ll see to you.’”\r\n\r\nLincoln, referring to the criticisms made upon the administration,\r\nparticularly in regard to matters entirely outside of its jurisdiction,\r\nsaid that he was reminded of a certain Long Island fisherman who\r\nwas accustomed to go out eeling every morning. In the old days, he\r\nasserted, he never caught less than a pailful of eels, but since\r\nthis administration came into power he had to be content with half a\r\npailful. Therefore he was going to vote for the Democratic party; he\r\n_wanted a change_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                    FOUR YEARS OF STRESS AND STRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBuchanan belonged to the school of American pro-slavery Presidents.\r\nDuring the last year of his administration he was as completely\r\ndominated by the Southern members of his Cabinet as were the\r\nMerovingian kings by their mayors of the palace. By blackest treachery,\r\nJohn B. Floyd, Secretary of War, and Isaac Toucey, Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, gorged the armories and navy-yards located in the slave\r\nStates with arms, ordnance, and all manner of munitions of war, thus\r\nanticipating months ahead what the Southern politicians regarded as\r\nthe “inevitable conflict.” The Federal Government, with the spineless\r\nBuchanan at its head, was utterly unprepared for the crisis.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when President Lincoln took the oath of office;\r\nsuch the already divided nation when the irresolute, truckling Buchanan\r\nhanded over the destinies of the Republic to his successor.\r\n\r\nNo heavier burden ever was imposed upon a ruler of any people.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was only partially fortunate in choosing his Cabinet.\r\nSeward was inevitable. Chase was a lucky guess, because he was without\r\na record as a financier. Cameron was a mistake, and the error was\r\nnot rectified as promptly as it should have been. The other members,\r\nwith the possible exception of Gideon Welles, who received the Navy\r\nportfolio, were negligible.\r\n\r\nThe administration found itself without an army, many of its ablest\r\nofficers having left the service to take up arms against the Federal\r\nGovernment. The rank and file of the army was fairly loyal, but the\r\ntroops had been so scattered by Buchanan’s secretary of war that they\r\ncould not be mobilized promptly when the hour of danger came. Despite\r\nthe plottings of Secretary Toucey, however, the vessels of the Navy\r\nwere so dispersed that the Confederacy was unable to seize many of\r\nthem. This was most fortunate, since it made possible the prompt\r\nestablishment of a Federal blockade over important Atlantic and Gulf\r\nports.\r\n\r\nLegal business took me to Washington about four months after Lincoln’s\r\nfirst inauguration and I called at the White House, in company with Mr.\r\nFenton. Although a score of men were present in the different parts of\r\nthe large room overlooking the South lot, Mr. Lincoln was walking the\r\nfloor in a preoccupied manner, evidently deeply distressed.\r\n\r\nThe Federal troops had just been defeated at Big Bethel by a much\r\nsmaller force under Magruder, a crushing blow for the Union arms.\r\n\r\nI suggested to Mr. Fenton that we should retire, as the visit seemed\r\ninopportune, but the President’s grave face showed signs of recognition\r\nwhen he saw Mr. Fenton. He stopped, and as we approached him, he said:\r\n\r\n“The storm is upon us; it will be much worse before it is better.\r\nI suppose there was a divine purpose in thrusting this terrible\r\nresponsibility upon me, and I can only hope for more than human\r\nguidance. I am only a mortal in the hands of destiny. I am ready for\r\nthe trial and shall do my best, because I know I am acting for the\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nHe did not mention the defeat that had occurred only two days before,\r\nbut it was evident that he comprehended fully the desperate situation\r\nthat confronted the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nBig Bethel was within ten miles of Fortress Monroe, and I subsequently\r\nlearned from a member of the Cabinet that the utmost anxiety existed\r\nregarding the safety of that post. If treachery existed among its\r\nofficers, the secret has been kept until this day, but one can\r\nunderstand the agonizing suspense of that hour. Had the great fortress\r\nat Old Point Comfort fallen into the hands of the Confederacy, the\r\nearly part of the war would necessarily have been fought upon entirely\r\ndifferent lines.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln possessed no knowledge of the art of war, but he had\r\nsufficient intuitive foresight to comprehend what the loss of control\r\nof the entrance to Chesapeake Bay and the mouth of the James River\r\nwould mean. Although he said so little, this meeting and the few words\r\nhe used were most impressive, and are stamped deep upon my memory.\r\n\r\nAs I have just remarked, military and naval technicalities did not\r\nmatter much to Lincoln, and he was accustomed to brush them aside in\r\nhis familiar, humorous way. When Mr. Bushnell brought to Washington\r\nthe plans for the _Monitor_, the recent invention of Mr. Ericsson,\r\nwhich became famous in the sea-fight with the rebel _Merrimac_, most\r\nof the naval officers expressed doubts as to the efficiency of the\r\n_Monitor_ in a naval fight. Mr. Lincoln’s opinion was asked. He said he\r\nknew little about ships, but he “did understand a flat-boat, and this\r\ninvention was flat enough.”\r\n\r\nLater, at a meeting of the Army board, when asked by Admiral Smith what\r\nhe thought of the _Monitor_, he remarked, with his most quizzical look,\r\n“Well, I feel a good deal about it as a fat girl did when she put her\r\nfoot in her stocking; she thought there was something in it.”\r\n\r\nAll present laughed at this drollery, but it was the way Lincoln\r\nsometimes took of conveying a really serious thought.\r\n\r\nAt that period of the war and until the battle of Gettysburg, two\r\nyears later, Southern leaders acted upon the theory that the people\r\nof the North were greatly divided in their sympathies, and that the\r\n“Copperheads” would either develop sufficient strength to stop the war;\r\nor, in the event of invasion of the Northern States, they would take\r\nup arms in support of the Confederacy. John Morgan’s raid into Ohio\r\nencouraged that belief, although he was captured and imprisoned; but\r\nthe utter indifference shown by the Pennsylvania “Copperheads,” who had\r\ntalked loudest in favor of the Southern cause, completely disillusioned\r\nthe Confederate chiefs. Vallandigham and Voorhees were shown to be\r\nwithout great influence. I had a direct statement from a member of the\r\nLincoln Cabinet that the President did not approve of Vallandigham’s\r\narrest by General Burnside, or his trial by court-martial and\r\nbanishment to the Southern lines. Lincoln declared the proceedings to\r\nbe those of an over-zealous general.\r\n\r\nDefeat after defeat of the Northern forces followed that of Big Bethel.\r\nThe raw volunteers from the Northern States could not successfully\r\noppose the better-trained Southern troops, led by West Point graduates.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln never lost heart; his courage never abated during those\r\nterrible months, while many men close to him were in a mental condition\r\nof dismay and panic.\r\n\r\nThe day of Burnside’s defeat at Fredericksburg Lincoln spent hours\r\nin the office of the War Department in dressing-gown and slippers,\r\nforgetting even to eat. When he heard of the great disaster he bowed\r\nhis head in despair, and murmured, “If there is any man out of\r\nperdition who suffers more than I do, I pity him.”\r\n\r\nSufficient credit was never given to Thurlow Weed for his successful\r\nefforts in England to prevent recognition of the Confederacy. Mr.\r\nLincoln described Weed as “a master of masters in politics,” and sent\r\nhim on that difficult mission late in 1861 when the situation looked\r\nvery dark. Our able minister at the court of St. James’s, Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, possessed Mr. Lincoln’s entire confidence, but the\r\nPresident deemed it advisable to have a special commissioner to present\r\nhis protest against the apprehended British recognition of the Southern\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nThe day before Mr. Weed’s departure I met him in the rotunda of the\r\nold Astor House, and found him imbued with more hope than I felt,\r\nregarding the conflict with the South. Of course, he made no mention\r\nof his intended mission to England, thinking that he could get away\r\nwithout the fact becoming known. He was disappointed, however, as the\r\nday following his departure all the newspapers published the news of\r\nhis special embassy. There were no Atlantic cables in those days, and\r\nby prompt action on his arrival he managed to hold his first interview\r\nwith Lord Russell before official information reached the British\r\nCabinet from Washington regarding the purpose of his presence in London.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher also visited England at Mr. Lincoln’s request,\r\npossibly at the suggestion of John Bright, who was almost the only\r\nprominent Briton who remained friendly to the Federal cause. Gladstone,\r\nPalmerston, and Disraeli were at that time in open sympathy with the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Beecher’s mission was wholly unofficial, and his efforts were\r\ndevoted to delivering addresses, such as only he could make, throughout\r\nEngland. These speeches and Mr. Weed’s efforts created such a wave\r\nof popular sentiment in behalf of the Federal cause that the British\r\nCabinet, if ever it had the purpose, was deterred from recognizing the\r\nStates in rebellion. It was the same kind of moral suasion employed\r\nby Gladstone prior to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, and which\r\nprevented England from going to the defense of Turkey, then her ally.\r\n\r\nThe relief experienced through General Lee’s defeat at Gettysburg and\r\nhis retreat across Maryland into Virginia was followed, ten days later\r\n(July, 1863), by the draft riots in New York.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of those three days have never been fully described.\r\n\r\nLed and encouraged by Southern sympathizers, who had retained\r\nthe feelings they held before the war, the rabble of the city\r\nsurged through the streets, destroying property, burning a negro\r\norphan-asylum, and killing black men. Nominally a protest against\r\nenforced enlistment, the riots were really an uprising of the dangerous\r\nelement that existed in the city at the time.\r\n\r\nI lived in Thirty-fourth Street, near Eighth Avenue, and had been a\r\npersistent speaker against the extension of slavery and in favor of the\r\nFederal cause. The day before the riots began, an anonymous note was\r\nreceived by my family, stating that our home would be attacked and that\r\nwe had best leave the city. We did not heed the warning.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the riots, July 13, 1863, a crowd gathered in\r\nfront of my house, shouting: “Down with the abolitionists!” “Death to\r\nDittenhoefer!” I sent a messenger for the police, and a squad arrived\r\nas the leaders of the mob were preparing to break in my door. Active\r\nclub work dispersed the crowd, and by order of the captain of the\r\nprecinct several policemen were kept on guard until the end of the\r\nriots.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I met Mrs. Carson, the daughter of the only\r\nUnion man in South Carolina, who, with her father, was compelled, after\r\nthe firing on Fort Sumter, to leave South Carolina, while his property\r\nwas confiscated. I had been anxious to sell my house in Thirty-fourth\r\nStreet. Noticing a “For Sale” sign on the property, Mrs. Carson called\r\non me and expressed a willingness to buy the house at the price named,\r\nasking me to see Samuel Blatchford, who in later years became a Supreme\r\nCourt Judge of the United States, and who, she said, was the head\r\nof an association raising funds for her support in New York. I saw\r\nJudge Blatchford, and a contract was signed for the sale. Later, in\r\nconsequence of the serious illness of my wife, I was obliged to ask\r\nJudge Blatchford to cancel the contract, saying that, by way of making\r\nup for the disappointment, I would gladly contribute a sum of money\r\nto the fund for Mrs. Carson. The contract was accordingly canceled. I\r\nnever saw Mrs. Carson afterward. About a year before the close of the\r\nrebellion, Mr. Lincoln offered to appoint me judge of the district\r\ncourt of South Carolina, my native State, but my increasing business\r\nin the city of New York and the disinclination of my wife to move to\r\nSouth Carolina compelled me to decline the honor.\r\n\r\nA little while before the offer of the Carolina judgeship was made me\r\nby the President I received a letter signed by Mrs. Carson, in which\r\nthe writer said that the President had asked her to recommend a man for\r\nthe position, and, remembering what I had done years before, she had\r\nsuggested my name to him. For a long time I could not think who Mrs.\r\nCarson could be, until my wife reminded me of the incident of the sale\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nPatriotic neglect of self-interest in behalf of the salvation of\r\nthe Union caused thousands of Northerners to lose opportunities\r\nfor accumulating wealth from the vast sums of money disbursed by\r\nthe Government; but there was a class at home and in Congress that\r\nneglected no chance to enrich itself. Its leaders were more concerned\r\nabout the commercial phase of the conflict than the triumph of the\r\nFederal arms.\r\n\r\nThey gambled on the destiny of the Republic, and their sources of\r\ninformation reached to the innermost sanctuaries of Government\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nOn advance information of a staggering defeat to the Northern arms,\r\nthey bought gold for a rise. Early news of a Federal victory caused\r\nthem to sell the precious metal for a decline. This transaction was\r\ndescribed by these gamblers in the nation’s life-blood as “coppering\r\nold Lincoln.”\r\n\r\nThis detestable clan pushed its representatives into the very councils\r\nof state, asserting its right to dictate the policy of the country,\r\nforeign and domestic. Its members were as intolerably arrogant as if\r\nthey had amassed their wealth by the strictest integrity.\r\n\r\nDuring a great part of the war President Lincoln, unsuspected by\r\nhim, was surrounded by a coterie of professional heroes, commercial\r\ngrafters, and alleged statesmen, every one of whom was in politics for\r\npersonal profit. Many “shining lights” then lauded for their patriotism\r\nhave long since been exposed as selfish and corrupt egotists. Close as\r\nsome of these unworthy persons contrived to get to Mr. Lincoln, they\r\nwere never able to besmirch him in any way.\r\n\r\nDuring one of my visits to the White House some weeks before the\r\npromulgation of the Emancipation Proclamation, I had the temerity to\r\nrefer to the oft-reported plan of Mr. Lincoln, before the rebellion\r\nburst upon the country, to free the Southern slaves by purchase. It\r\nwas a theme that had often engaged my thoughts. After the beginning\r\nof the war and a realization that the conflict was costing more than\r\n$1,000,000 per day, I had become somewhat reconciled to the idea.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was slow to answer, saying, in effect, that however wise\r\nthe idea might have been, it was too late to revive it. He did not\r\nintimate that he had in contemplation the Emancipation Proclamation\r\nwhich was to take effect January 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had all the figures about slave property at his\r\nfinger-ends, but, much to my regret, I did not make a memorandum of\r\nthe interview and, therefore, cannot recall the exact number of slaves\r\nthat he estimated would have to be purchased. Field hands were valued\r\nat from six hundred to one thousand dollars each, but the old men and\r\nwomen and young children would reduce the average price. This would\r\nhave absorbed $500,000,000, a sum that, prior to the experience of one\r\nyear’s war expenditure, would have appeared staggering. When, however,\r\nMr. Lincoln called attention to the rapidly growing national debt, with\r\nno prospect of ending the conflict for years to come, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“What a splendid investment it would have been!”\r\n\r\nThese words, as the mentally distressed Lincoln uttered them in that\r\ndark hour of the Civil War, were of thrilling import. He rose to his\r\nfull height; my eyes instinctively traced his majestic length from his\r\nslippers to his head of iron-gray hair, and there was an expression of\r\nsadness in his face that I never shall forget.\r\n\r\nReferring to the severe criticisms that were launched against him\r\nrespecting the views he entertained about the reconstruction of the\r\nUnion, he said:\r\n\r\n“I do the best I can, and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If\r\nthe end brings me out all right, what is said against me won’t amount\r\nto anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was\r\nright would make no difference.”\r\n\r\nThe entrance of a delegation prevented a continuance of the\r\nconversation. Years afterward, Col. A. K. McClure told me that as late\r\nas August, prior to the November elections of 1864, President Lincoln\r\nhad recurred to his plan for freeing the negroes by purchase, and\r\nsettling the war on the basis of universal extinction of slavery in all\r\nStates of the Union at an expense of $400,000,000, a compromise which\r\nhe believed the Southern leaders, in their hopeless condition after\r\nthe battle of Gettysburg, would be glad to accept. Mr. Lincoln went on\r\nto predict that the promulgation of such a scheme at that time would\r\ndefeat his re-election. McClure not only confirmed him in that opinion,\r\nbut added that Congress was in no mood to appropriate so large a sum of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nRedemption of these bonds, if the Union was restored after the war,\r\nwould fall in part on the Southern people; they would be paying out of\r\ntheir own pockets for the liberation of their slaves. This statement\r\nof McClure’s is remarkable because it indicates that Lincoln believed\r\nthat the _status quo ante bellum_ could be restored and reconstruction\r\nformalities avoided. Unfortunately, under Andrew Johnson, who succeeded\r\nto the Presidency after Lincoln’s assassination, and subsequently under\r\nPresident Hayes, the “carpet-bag” régime, with all its horrors and\r\ncorruption, was inflicted upon the Southern States.\r\n\r\nColonel McClure’s judgment was keen and accurate. Congress, led by\r\nSenator Sumner and Representatives Thaddeus Stevens and Henry Winter\r\nDavis, would have repudiated such a proposition if made by Lincoln.\r\nEven after his re-election he could not have secured the money for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter, who made the famous painting of the Cabinet when Mr.\r\nLincoln read the draft of the Emancipation Proclamation, and who was\r\na client of mine, told me Mr. Lincoln had said to him that for a long\r\ntime he had been considering the necessity of eventually issuing the\r\nProclamation; but that he was held back by the intense desire that\r\nwas always in his mind to restore the Union, and his fear that if he\r\nproclaimed emancipation prematurely the restoration of the Union would\r\nbe prevented. During his entire administration and in all his addresses\r\nthis desire to restore the Union was supreme and it controlled his\r\nevery action.\r\n\r\nOn the momentous occasion when Lincoln read the preliminary draft of\r\nhis Emancipation Proclamation before his Cabinet, he amused himself and\r\nthe others--with the exception of Secretary Stanton, who was plainly\r\namazed at the President’s seeming levity--by first reading to them from\r\nArtemas Ward’s amusing story of “The High-Handed Outrage at Utica.”\r\n\r\nLater on I remember having been present when Lincoln said, “If my name\r\nis ever remembered it will be for this act; my whole soul is in it.”\r\n\r\nIt is curious, the thing we call history. An act popularly regarded as\r\nmadness at one period is hailed as concrete wisdom at another. History\r\nis only a crystallization of popular beliefs.\r\n\r\nMany people very close to Lincoln have doubted his sympathy for\r\nthe slaves, and have referred to his frequent characterization of\r\nabolitionists as “a disturbing element in the nation, that ought to be\r\nsubjected to some sort of control.” They assert that his efforts were\r\ndirected solely to restraining the ambitions of the slaveholders to\r\nextend their system of human bondage over larger areas of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSuch judgment of Lincoln is at variance with my personal observations\r\nand does him a grave injustice. His nature was essentially\r\nsympathetic, although he never went the length of asserting that he\r\nregarded the black man as his social equal.\r\n\r\nSubsequent observation has shown me that the immediate admission of the\r\nliberated slaves to equal rights of franchise was an error.\r\n\r\nIt revived the former bitterness with which the Southern people had\r\nregarded the Northerners, and imposed a grievous injustice upon them,\r\nan injustice naturally and forcibly resented. And so followed the\r\nformation of the “Invisible Empire” and the excesses of the “Ku-Klux\r\nKlan.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII\r\n\r\n                           THE RENOMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe renomination of Mr. Lincoln in 1864 was not accomplished with ease.\r\nThe difficulties did not all show upon the surface, because some of the\r\nPresident’s closest associates were secretly conspiring against him.\r\nOpen and frank opposition came from such influential Republicans as\r\nHenry Winter Davis, of Maryland, Benjamin F. Wade, of Ohio, and Horace\r\nGreeley, of New York, who believed his re-election impossible. But the\r\nopposition of Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio, was secret, as he had been\r\nscheming for the nomination himself. Chase, while regarding himself as\r\nMr. Lincoln’s friend and constantly protesting his friendship to the\r\nPresident, held a condescending opinion of Mr. Lincoln’s intellect.\r\nHe could not believe the people so blind as to prefer Abraham Lincoln\r\nto Salmon Chase. He vigorously protested, both verbally and in\r\nletters written to every part of the country, his indifference to the\r\nPresidency, at the same time painting pessimistically the dreadful\r\nstate of government affairs, and indicating, not always subtly, his\r\nwillingness to accept the nomination.\r\n\r\nAs to Chase’s candidacy, Lincoln once said, according to Nicolay: “I\r\nhave determined to shut my eyes as far as possible to everything of the\r\nsort. Mr. Chase makes a good secretary and I shall keep him where he\r\nis.” Then with characteristic magnanimity, he added: “If Chase becomes\r\nPresident, all right. I hope we may never have a worse man.” But as\r\nJoseph Medill, editor of the Chicago _Tribune_, wrote in December, 1863:\r\n\r\n I presume it is true that Mr. Chase’s friends are making for his\r\n nomination, but it is all lost labor; Old Abe has the inside track\r\n so completely that he will be nominated by acclamation when the\r\n convention meets.\r\n\r\nA reference here to the activities of Chase’s brilliant daughter,\r\nKate Chase Sprague, in the Tilden and Hayes contest many years later,\r\nmay be pardoned. It is well known that through her potent influence\r\nthe contest was finally decided in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes, and\r\nagainst Samuel J. Tilden. This influence, it has been said, was used\r\nin a spirit of revenge against Mr. Tilden for defeating her father for\r\nthe Democratic nomination in 1868. Col. A. K. McClure agrees with me in\r\nthis, as will be shown by the following quotation from his book, _Our\r\nPresidents and How We Make Them_:\r\n\r\n The Democratic National Convention met in New York on the 4th\r\n of July, 1868. There was a strong sentiment among the delegates\r\n favorable to the nomination of a liberal Republican for President,\r\n but Chief Justice Chase, who was an old-time Democrat and who had won\r\n a very large measure of Democratic confidence by his ruling in the\r\n impeachment case of President Johnson, was a favorite with a very\r\n powerful circle of friends who had quietly, but very thoroughly, as\r\n they believed, organized to have him nominated by a spontaneous tidal\r\n wave after a protracted deadlock between the leading candidates.\r\n Chase would have been nominated at the time Seymour was chosen,\r\n and in like manner, had it not been for the carefully laid plan of\r\n Samuel J. Tilden to prevent the success of Chase. Tilden was a master\r\n leader, subtle as he was able, and he thoroughly organized the plan to\r\n nominate Seymour, not so much that he desired Seymour, but because he\r\n was implacable in his hostility to Chase.\r\n\r\n It was well known by Chase and his friends that Tilden crucified Chase\r\n in the Democratic convention of 1868, and this act of Tilden’s had\r\n an impressive sequel eight years later when the election of Tilden\r\n hung in the balance in the Senate, and when Kate Chase Sprague, the\r\n accomplished daughter of Chase, decided the battle against Tilden.\r\n\r\nWhile Charles Sumner was openly for Lincoln, he privately criticized\r\nhim, even after the promulgation of the Emancipation Proclamation which\r\nhad freed the slaves of the South.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that Lincoln did not consult with Sumner as to\r\nthat message, and that that was the cause of his ill-feeling. Thaddeus\r\nStevens, the great Free Soil representative of Pennsylvania, was\r\ndissatisfied because the President was unwilling to confiscate all the\r\nproperty of the secessionists and to inflict other punishments upon\r\nthem: he was openly hostile to Lincoln.\r\n\r\nFor the following hitherto unpublished letter, from Horace Greeley to\r\nMark Howard, a prominent Connecticut Republican, I am indebted to the\r\nlatter’s daughter, Mrs. Graves. It throws an interesting light upon the\r\nfears and uncertainties of the period, and indicates Greeley’s lack of\r\nconfidence in Lincoln as the strong man of the nation. The letter is\r\ndated ten months before the second election, and Greeley’s opposition\r\nto Mr. Lincoln’s renomination became the more undisguised and intense\r\nas time went on.\r\n\r\n                                                  OFFICE OF THE TRIBUNE.\r\n\r\n                                              NEW YORK, _Jan. 10, 1864_.\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR,--I mean to keep the Presidency in the background until\r\n we see whether we cannot close up the war. I am terribly afraid of\r\n letting the war run into the next Presidential term; I fear it will\r\n prove disastrous to go to the ballot-boxes with the war still pending.\r\n Let us have peace first, then we can see into the future.\r\n\r\n                                                         Yours,\r\n                                                         HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n                                                      MARK HOWARD, ESQ.,\r\n                                                      Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley gave open expression to his opposition in the New York\r\n_Tribune_, Friday, April 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn this issue Mr. Greeley, referring to the statement of the President,\r\n“I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events\r\nhave controlled me,” declared that “had he been a little more docile\r\nto their teaching and prompt to apprehend their bearing we should have\r\nbeen saved many disasters and rivers of precious blood. May we hope\r\nthat with regard to the murder of our soldiers who have surrendered,\r\nand other questions of the hour, he will have learned something from\r\nthe sore experience of the past?”\r\n\r\nOther newspapers joined the _Tribune_ in opposing Lincoln’s\r\nrenomination, as witness these excerpts from the New York _Herald_,\r\nAugust 6, 1864:\r\n\r\n Senator Wade, of Ohio, and Representative Davis, of Maryland,\r\n Chairman of the Senate and House Committees on the rebellious States\r\n prepared and presented in their official capacity an indictment\r\n against Abraham Lincoln, the executive head of the nation, and the\r\n nominee of his party for another term of office, charging him with\r\n arrogance, ignorance, usurpation, knavery, and a host of other deadly\r\n sins including that of hostility to the rights of humanity and to the\r\n principles of republican government.\r\n\r\n Mr. Lincoln has been frequently represented as entertaining and\r\n expressing an ardent wish that he could slip off his shoulders the\r\n anxieties and labors belonging to his present position and place upon\r\n them the musket and knapsack of a Union volunteer. The opportunity\r\n of realizing that wish now presents itself. The country would be\r\n overjoyed to see it realized, and all the people would say “Amen” to\r\n it. Let him make up his mind to join the quota which his town of\r\n Springfield, Ill., will next be called on to furnish. He is said to\r\n have done well as railsplitter, and we have no doubt that he will do\r\n equally well as a soldier. As a President of the United States he must\r\n have sense enough to see and acknowledge he has been an egregious\r\n failure. The best thing he can do now for himself, his party, and his\r\n country is to retire from the high position to which, in an evil hour,\r\n he was exalted.\r\n\r\n One thing must be self-evident to him, and that is that under no\r\n circumstances can he hope to be the next President of the United\r\n States, and if he will only make a virtue of necessity and withdraw\r\n from the Presidential campaign....\r\n\r\nIn the New York _Tribune_, August 24, 1864, under the heading,\r\n“Copperhead Treason,” the _Daily News_ is quoted as referring to\r\nPresident Lincoln as “our intriguing chief magistrate.”\r\n\r\nFinally, there was general disaffection, centering largely in New York\r\nand St. Louis, and a so-called convention of opponents of Lincoln\r\ngathered at Cleveland in May, and indulged in denunciation of Lincoln,\r\nwhich included a bitter letter from Wendell Phillips. This self-styled\r\n“radical Democracy” adopted a platform, nominated Fremont, and\r\npractically disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic and self-sacrificing people of the North were almost a\r\nunit in sustaining President Lincoln, and, by sheer force of numbers,\r\nswept aside the ungrateful or designing Republican leaders who would\r\nhave defeated the great emancipator.\r\n\r\nDuring the days that immediately preceded his renomination, Mr. Lincoln\r\ngave way to despondency, and, although he never said so in words, one\r\ncould clearly see by the anxiety he manifested that he was sorely\r\nperplexed to account for the animus of certain men against him. He\r\nappeared to be especially anxious about New York, and to fear that\r\nthe enmity of Seward’s old friends and the hostility of Mr. Greeley\r\nmight cause him to lose the delegation from the Empire State. I was\r\nin Washington at that time on professional business, and was able to\r\nimpart to him positive information regarding his strength in various\r\nparts of the State. To his inquiry about the situation in New York,\r\nI told him that, while Greeley was still in the sulks, yet I thought\r\nSeward and Weed were coming around to him (Lincoln) handsomely, and\r\nthat their action would undoubtedly influence the Seward partisans.\r\nI added that in my opinion Greeley would before long forget his\r\ndisappointment and fall into line. Mr. Lincoln listened attentively and\r\nnodded assent. “That’s good news,” he said, heartily, seemingly well\r\npleased with my prognostications.\r\n\r\nCol. A. K. McClure, of Pennsylvania, stood very close to the President\r\nat this time and did not disguise from him the treachery of several\r\nRepublican leaders.\r\n\r\nAnxiety had become an obsession with the President. This seemed due to\r\na physical and mental reaction after three years of incessant worry and\r\nstrain. And yet at this hour General Grant appeared to be smashing his\r\nway through the Wilderness, toward Richmond; General Sherman had left\r\nChattanooga on his march to the sea by which the Confederacy was cut\r\nin two; the dashing Sheridan was harassing the enemy in the Shenandoah\r\nValley, and the collapse of the rebellion was foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nI am sure Mr. Lincoln cared but little for his own political future,\r\nbut he was most desirous of carrying out his plans regarding\r\nreconstruction, and the frankness with which he had spoken his views on\r\nthe subject made enemies of such men as Greeley, Sumner, and Stevens.\r\nHad he dissembled, concealing his sympathies for the suffering civilian\r\npopulation in the South who had taken no active part in the rebellion,\r\nuntil such time as he could properly lay his plans before Congress and\r\nexplain them, hostility against him would have been confined to a few\r\npoliticians actuated by envy or personal ambition.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Lincoln made no secret of his desire for the prompt\r\nreorganization of the seceded States, immediately peace was attained;\r\nand for their readmission into the Union, with representation in both\r\nHouses of Congress, thus carrying out the thought always uppermost\r\nin his mind of the restoration of the Union. And yet his sorrows,\r\nworriments, and perplexities could not drown his sense of humor, as the\r\nfollowing occurrence shows:\r\n\r\nA conference was held on shipboard in Hampton Roads about the time\r\nthat the collapse of the Confederacy seemed imminent, the consultants\r\nincluding the Vice-President of the Confederacy, Alexander H. Stevens,\r\nand R. M. T. Hunter and J. A. Campbell, on the one side, and Mr.\r\nLincoln and Mr. Seward on the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter, to enforce his contentions, referred to the correspondence\r\nbetween Charles the First, of England, and Parliament.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln’s face,” it is reported, “wore the inscrutable expression\r\nwhich generally preceded his hardest hits,” as he replied: “Upon\r\nquestions of history I must refer you to Mr. Seward, for he is\r\nposted in such things, and I do not profess to be; my only distinct\r\nrecollection of the matter is that Charles lost his head.”\r\n\r\nUnder the reconstruction policy planned by the great President and\r\ncarried out by his successor, President Johnson, the rebel States were\r\ntaken back in the Union with the same representation in Congress they\r\nhad before they started on the war of secession.\r\n\r\nTo obviate the danger which would arise from the control of the\r\nSouthern States by the unrepentant rebels, and to minimize the danger\r\nthat might result from the large number of members they would have in\r\nCongress, it was deemed necessary to give the illiterate and shiftless\r\nnegroes, just emerging from slavery, and who constituted a majority of\r\nthe voters in many of the Southern States, the right to vote.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in the detestable State governments composed of negroes\r\nand “carpet-bag” whites, no less corrupt than the negroes. The whites\r\nwere called “carpet-baggers,” because they came from the North, with\r\nno intention of remaining permanently; they only wanted to exploit\r\nthe South for their own profit; and they generally traveled in light\r\nmarching order, with all their worldly possessions packed in the\r\nfamiliar carpet-bag of the period.\r\n\r\nSumner, Stevens, and Winter Davis opposed this reconstruction policy,\r\ncontending that the rebel States should be held as conquered territory\r\nuntil a new generation should arrive on the scene.\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate to say at the time that they were right. Had their\r\npolicy been adopted the terrible evils of the “carpet-bag” governments\r\nwould have been avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the last conversation I had with Mr. Lincoln on the subject of his\r\nrenomination, about ten days before the convention of 1864, I tried\r\nto convince him that his doubts and fears were unwarranted, but I\r\ndid not succeed in lightening the gloom. He probably thought me too\r\nyoung a man to form an accurate opinion, but I had investigated for\r\nmyself, as well as advised with the best-informed Republicans in my\r\nState. It seemed as though he could not forget that previous miraculous\r\nnomination by a convention in which two-thirds of the delegates favored\r\nanother candidate; he feared lest now the boot might be on the other\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention assembled at Baltimore on June\r\n7, 1864, the aged Rev. Dr. Robert J. Breckinridge, of Kentucky,\r\nbeing temporary chairman, and ex-Governor William Dennison, of Ohio,\r\npermanent presiding officer.\r\n\r\nAll opposition melted away when the platform was read and adopted. The\r\nthird plank therein denounced “slavery as the cause of the rebellion,\r\nalways and everywhere hostile to principles of republican government;\r\ntherefore, national safety demands its utter and complete extirpation\r\nfrom the soil of the Republic.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was renominated on the first ballot, receiving the\r\nunanimous vote of every State, with the exception of Missouri, the\r\ndelegation from which State was instructed for General Grant. The\r\nMissouri vote was at once changed to Lincoln, making the nomination\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nAt that convention I circulated among the representatives from other\r\nStates, and overheard many mutterings of dissatisfaction at the\r\ninevitability of the choice, but not a hostile word was spoken from the\r\nrostrum. I joined with delegates from my State in addressing a message\r\nof congratulation to Mr. Lincoln at Washington.\r\n\r\nGreeley, of course, was obliged to come around to support Lincoln’s\r\nre-election, but he could not refrain from damning him with faint\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nUnder the caption of “Opening the Presidential Campaign,” Mr. Greeley,\r\nin the _Tribune_ of February 23, 1864, thus indicated his change of\r\nfront toward Mr. Lincoln:\r\n\r\n He has been patriotic, honest, and faithful. He has done his utmost to\r\n serve and save the country.... He is not infallible, not a genius, not\r\n one of those rare, great men who mould their age into the similitude\r\n of their own high character, massive abilities, and lofty aims. But,\r\n considering his antecedents and his experience of public affairs we\r\n are sure the verdict of history in his case will be “well done, thou\r\n good and faithful servant.” The luster of his good deeds will far\r\n outlive the memory of his mistakes and faults.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Greeley stood too close to his subject, but surely these\r\ncondescending words may be considered a masterpiece of ineptitude.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Greeley averse to reprinting hostile criticisms from\r\noutside sources, as the following excerpts will witness:\r\n\r\nIn the New York _Tribune_, June 21, 1864, under the heading, “Rebel\r\nViews of our Nomination--A Railsplitter and a Tailor,” the Richmond\r\n_Examiner_ is quoted as saying:\r\n\r\n The Convention of Black Republicans in Baltimore have nominated for\r\n President of their country Abraham Lincoln, the Illinois railsplitter.\r\n\r\n The great army of contractors and office-holders--in short, those who\r\n live by war and on the country--have succeeded, at least, in starting\r\n Lincoln fairly for another race. It amounts to a declaration that\r\n those conventioners desire to see four years more in all respects like\r\n unto the last four years.\r\n\r\nAnother extract from the Richmond _Examiner_ also appears in the\r\n_Tribune_ at about the same date:\r\n\r\n The only merit we can discover in this Baltimore ticket is the merit\r\n of _consistency_; it is all of a piece; the tail does not shame the\r\n head, nor the head shame the tail. A railsplitting buffoon and a\r\n boorish tailor, both from the backwoods. Both growing up in uncouth\r\n ignorance, they would afford a grotesque subject for a satiric poet.\r\n\r\nI had known from the President’s own lips, at my last interview,\r\nthat he desired the selection of Andrew Johnson, a Tennessean, whose\r\nsteadfast support of the Federal cause in these troublesome times had\r\nattracted attention. I was not in sympathy with that plan, because I\r\nthought that Johnson would cost the party many votes among the radicals\r\nin New England.\r\n\r\nNobody could forecast at that time with reasonable certainty the\r\nDemocratic candidates, and there was considerable fear that General\r\nGrant might be named. He was popularly believed to be bringing\r\nthe rebellion to an early finish; if he succeeded in forcing the\r\ncapitulation of General Lee before the Democratic convention met in\r\nChicago at the end of August, the opposition party might seize upon him\r\nand could probably elect him. Grant had been an old-line Democrat and,\r\nso far as known, had voted for Douglas in 1860. There was no political\r\nreason why Grant could not accept such a nomination.\r\n\r\nIn June, General McClellan’s name had not been seriously considered. He\r\nwas a man with a grievance, for he had been removed from the command of\r\nthe Federal Army after a long endurance of his procrastinating policy\r\nby the administration. The universal affection felt for McClellan\r\nthroughout the Northern Army, especially the Army of the Potomac, seems\r\ndifficult of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX\r\n\r\n                         THE CAMPAIGN OF 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign for the Republican ticket began before the name of\r\nthe Democratic candidate was known. Speakers were haranguing the\r\npeople in every Northern State, but if Mr. Lincoln’s doubts about\r\nhis renomination had been serious, his fear of defeat at the polls\r\ndeveloped into a veritable mental panic. Both Nicolay and Gideon\r\nWelles refer to the following note, which, indorsed on the back by all\r\nthe Cabinet members, was sealed and committed to the keeping of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, with instructions that it should not be opened\r\nuntil after election. I believe that the original has been presented by\r\nMiss Nicolay to the Library of Congress:\r\n\r\n This morning, as for some days past, it seemed improbable that\r\n this administration will be re-elected. Then it will be my duty\r\n to co-operate with the President-elect so as to save the Union\r\n between the election and the inauguration, as my successor will have\r\n secured his election on such grounds that he cannot possibly save it\r\n afterwards.\r\n\r\n                                          _August 23, 1864._ A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this remarkable document bears date six days\r\nbefore the assembling of the Democratic convention at Chicago, on\r\nAugust 29. At that time Mr. Lincoln was aware of the plan to nominate\r\nMcClellan, and feared his strength.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the Republican convention, early in June, and\r\nthe gathering of the Democrats at the end of August, the progress of\r\nthe Federal arms had not realized expectations. Grant had not taken\r\nRichmond, and Sherman had not administered a decisive blow to General\r\nJohnson.\r\n\r\nPolitically, the situation was somewhat more hopeful. The selection\r\nof Andrew Johnson as Vice-President on the Republican ticket had\r\nconciliated many Northern Democrats like Judge Holt, General Dix,\r\nand General Butler; moreover, it had prevented recognition of the\r\nConfederacy by France and England. Lincoln’s foresight in substituting\r\nthe Tennessean for Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, was generally admitted.\r\n\r\nMcClellan developed more strength than was suspected. The best opinion\r\nis that, had the election occurred directly after his nomination and\r\nbefore people had had opportunity to study the platform upon which\r\nhe had consented to stand, he would have been successful. Soon after\r\nthe Democratic convention adjourned, however, the capture of Atlanta\r\nby Sherman was announced; then followed the sturdy blows of Grant\r\nat the Confederate capital and Sheridan’s series of victories in the\r\nShenandoah Valley. These happy events completely changed the political\r\nattitude of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic managers at Chicago had committed the execrable blunder\r\nof declaring in their platform that the war had been a failure and\r\nthat the public welfare demanded “an immediate effort be made for a\r\ncessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate convention of all\r\nthe States.”\r\n\r\nLittle more than two months remained before election day in November,\r\nand every speaker that could be commandeered was put into active\r\nservice. Lincoln himself took no active part in the campaign outside\r\nof a few addresses to soldiers, but mass-meetings were held every day\r\nand night of the week, and popular preachers with Republican sympathies\r\nfilled their discourses with appeals in behalf of Lincoln and the\r\nnecessity of his re-election for the preservation of the Union. Henry\r\nWard Beecher became a tower of strength to the Lincoln cause, and in\r\nand out of Plymouth pulpit he advocated the duty of sustaining the\r\nadministration that had already saved the Union and must ultimately put\r\ndown the rebellion. I addressed meetings every night.\r\n\r\nThe campaign soon became one of great acrimony on both sides. Night and\r\nday, without cessation, young men like myself, in halls, upon street\r\ncorners, and from cart-tails, were haranguing, pleading, sermonizing,\r\norating, arguing, extolling our cause and our candidate, and denouncing\r\nour opponents. A deal of oratory, elocution, rhetoric, declamation, and\r\neloquence was hurled into the troubled air by speakers on both sides.\r\n\r\nDenunciation of Lincoln by Democratic spellbinders was of the bitterest\r\ncharacter. Newspapers affiliated with the anti-war party criticized\r\nevery act of the administration and belittled the conduct of the war by\r\nFederal generals in the field. Therefore, Republican speakers did not\r\nmince words in criticism of the Democratic Presidential candidate, Gen.\r\nGeorge B. McClellan.\r\n\r\nOn September 27, five weeks before election day, I spoke to an audience\r\nthat filled every seat in Cooper Institute, on the questions of the\r\nhour. Read in the calmness of to-day my language appears unwarrantedly\r\naggressive, but at that time it seemed conservative. As an example of\r\nthe spirit of the campaign I venture to quote a few extracts:\r\n\r\n The battle that will be fought in November between the Union and the\r\n Confederate forces north of the Potomac will end in the destruction\r\n or exhaustion of the Southern Confederacy. Abraham Lincoln is the\r\n commander of the Union forces. I will now prove that George B.\r\n McClellan is the leader of the Confederate forces.\r\n\r\n While at the head of the Army, McClellan attempted to dictate to\r\n President Lincoln a policy acceptable to the Confederate South.\r\n Every man in the North influenced by “Copperheads,” who opposed the\r\n war, demanded that this “fighting general” be replaced at the head\r\n of our armies. He had become harnessed to the slave power, and he,\r\n with General Pendleton, candidate for Vice-President, became the\r\n incarnation of the Democratic peace platform.\r\n\r\n McClellan’s nomination was received with enthusiasm and cheers by\r\n the Confederate soldiers; the Southern newspapers declared that\r\n McClellan’s election would be helped by Grant’s defeat in the field.\r\n Confederate bonds advanced on the announcement of McClellan’s\r\n nomination. Every Southern sympathizer in the North, passive or active\r\n in his devotion to Jefferson Davis, will vote for McClellan.\r\n\r\n He says in his letter of acceptance that his sentiments are identical\r\n with those of the platform which pronounced the war a failure, and\r\n he promised, if the Democratic candidate were elected, an immediate\r\n cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nI called attention to the fact that such men as Fernando Wood,\r\nVallandigham, and Horatio Seymour, once Governor of New York, supported\r\nMcClellan, thus indorsing the letter of acceptance, in which he\r\npromises to enforce the policy set forth in the peace platform of his\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n McClellan’s military career, consistent with his whole history, may\r\n be summed up in one word--“delay”--which gave to the Confederacy what\r\n it needed--time. Is it not then true that McClellan heads, in this\r\n campaign, the Confederate forces North?\r\n\r\nI then read the following excerpt from the Democratic platform:\r\n\r\n Resolved, that this Convention does explicitly declare, as the sense\r\n of the American people, that after four years of failure to restore\r\n the Union by the experiment of war during which, under the pretense\r\n of a military necessity for a war-power higher than the Constitution,\r\n the Constitution itself has been disregarded in every part; and\r\n public liberty and private right alike trodden down, and the material\r\n prosperity of the country essentially impaired, justice, humanity,\r\n liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts be\r\n made for the cessation of hostilities, with a view to the ultimate\r\n convention of the States or other peaceful means, to the end that at\r\n the earliest practicable moment peace may be restored on the basis of\r\n Federal Union of the States. Resolved, that the direct interference of\r\n the military authorities of the United States in the recent elections\r\n held in Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and Delaware was a shameful\r\n violation of the Constitution and a repetition of such acts in the\r\n approaching election will be held as revolutionary and resisted with\r\n all the means and power under our control.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n In other words [I resumed], it was a bold and pernicious declaration\r\n of hostilities that war should close at once and that a convention\r\n should be called at a later period, to revise the Constitution. But it\r\n is easy to comprehend that when such a convention should be called,\r\n Jefferson Davis would refuse to enter its doors, and be prepared to\r\n enforce his refusal.\r\n\r\n Jefferson Davis, his resources crippled and with his last levies on\r\n the firing-line, is naturally anxious that Lincoln be defeated, for he\r\n knows, by this time, that with Lincoln as President the Confederacy\r\n will be compelled to abandon a hopeless contest. Davis cannot, and\r\n will not, continue the fight if Lincoln is re-elected, notwithstanding\r\n his threat to “fight to the last ditch.”\r\n\r\n Lincoln’s re-election will banish all hope of triumph for the\r\n Confederacy. A firm and everlasting peace will follow, based upon\r\n a reconstructed Union and freedom everywhere. The American Union,\r\n strong, powerful, and freed from slavery, will be honored the world\r\n over.\r\n\r\n    “Be it storm, or summer weather,\r\n      Peaceful calm or battle jar,\r\n    Stand in beauteous strength together,\r\n      Sister States as once ye were.”\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money were expended in expensive printing during that\r\ncampaign. Some of the publications were elaborately designed and\r\nillustrated. Recently one of the Lincoln and Johnson posters has been\r\npresented to me, and the miniature reproduction on the following page\r\nshould be of interest.\r\n\r\nThe names of the electors for the State of New York include that of\r\nthe writer. The poster is printed in several colors, it is five feet\r\nhigh and three and one-half feet wide. It is in a perfect state of\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nAs I have indicated, the victories of Sheridan and Sherman produced a\r\nrevulsion against peace sentiment throughout the North that literally\r\nswamped McClellan. The popular vote was large, Lincoln securing\r\n2,213,665 votes, and McClellan 1,802,237 votes. Except among the troops\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and Kentucky, the soldier vote was overwhelmingly in\r\nfavor of Lincoln. This was a surprise.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration:\r\n\r\n                           Union Nominations\r\n\r\n                         CLARRY & REILLEY, ENG.\r\n\r\n   For Electors of President and Vice President of the United States,\r\n\r\n                     HORACE GREELEY, PRESTON KING,\r\n     Obadiah Bowne William H.

In the latter year Mr. Wilson received 435 votes, Mr.\r\nTaft 15, and Mr. Roosevelt 81.\r\n\r\nThe electoral ticket for Lincoln having been successful in New York\r\nState, the thirty-three electors, of whom I was one, met at Albany and\r\ncast the votes of the State for Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe ballots were inscribed on wooden blocks, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n President, Abraham Lincoln\r\n\r\nand underneath, in brackets,\r\n\r\n [Abram J. Dittenhoefer] Elector\r\n\r\nA few weeks later I took one of these wooden block ballots with me to\r\nWashington and showed it to the President. He asked me if I would not\r\ngive it to him as a souvenir, which I was very glad to do.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley and Preston King were the two electors-at-large.\r\nAlthough Greeley had violently opposed the renomination of Lincoln,\r\nwise counsels put him at the head of the Presidential electors, a\r\ncompliment that Mr. Greeley told me highly gratified him, in view of\r\nhis previous attitude toward the President.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Greeley became the Democratic candidate for President in 1872\r\nand many Republicans seceded from the Republican party, Mr. Greeley\r\nrequested me to act as chairman of the executive committee of the\r\nLiberal Republican Central Committee in New York City, and I consented\r\nto do so. Chauncey M. Depew, who also identified himself with the\r\nLiberal Republican organization, became the candidate of the party for\r\nSecretary of State of New York. I afterward regretted that I had joined\r\nin that movement, and my regret was intensified when Greeley’s campaign\r\nturned out to be so great a fiasco.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s assassination, April 12, 1865, thwarted the generous,\r\nnoble-hearted plans which he had devised for the restoration of the\r\nUnion, and resulted in imposing upon the Southern people by Andrew\r\nJohnson, Lincoln’s successor, the corrupt “carpet-bag” régime.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s place in the history of civilization is immutably fixed.\r\nDuring the last ten years of his career, he was the greatest of all\r\nliving men. As statesman and reformer he belongs not alone to America,\r\nbut to the whole world.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington established this Republic, but the curse of human\r\nslavery adhered to the otherwise splendid Government he was so largely\r\ninstrumental in creating.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln eradicated this curse.\r\n\r\nHalleck’s verse comes back to me again as I close these recollections:\r\n\r\n    One of the few, the immortal names\r\n      That were not born to die!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END",
