Though I feel\r\nthat my knowledge of English is so imperfect that many errors of idiom\r\nand style and even of grammar must appear in my pages, yet I hope that\r\nthe courtesy which I have ever experienced in this country will be\r\nextended also to my book.\r\n\r\nMy aim has been twofold: on the one hand, to arouse my own countrymen to\r\na sense of the great part Japan has to play in the coming century; on\r\nthe other, to call the attention of Englishmen to the important position\r\nmy country occupies with regard to British interests in the far East.\r\n\r\nThe first part deals with Japan and the Pacific Question: but so closely\r\nis the latter bound up with the so-called Eastern Question that in the\r\nsecond part I have traced the history of the latter from its genesis to\r\nits present development. Commencing with a historical retrospect of\r\nRussian and English policy in Eastern Europe, I have marked the\r\nappearance of a rivalry between these two Powers which has extended from\r\nEastern Europe to Central Asia, and is extending thence to Eastern Asia\r\nand the Pacific. This I have done because any movement in Eastern Europe\r\nor Central Asia will henceforth infallibly spread northwards to the\r\nBaltic and eastwards to the Pacific. An acquaintance with the Eastern\r\nQuestion in all its phases will thus be necessary for the statesmen of\r\nJapan in the immediate future. I have confined my view to England and\r\nRussia because their interests in Asia and the North Pacific are so\r\ndirect and so important that they must enter into close relations with\r\nmy own country in the next century.\r\n\r\nI cannot claim an extensive knowledge of the problems I have sought to\r\ninvestigate, but it is my intention to continue that investigation in\r\nthe several countries under consideration. By personal inquiries and\r\nobservations in Eastern Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia,\r\nChina, and the Malay Archipelago, I hope to correct some and confirm\r\nothers of my conclusions.\r\n\r\nI have to thank many members of the University of Cambridge for their\r\nhelp during the writing and publication of my book. To Professor Seeley\r\nespecially, whose hints and suggestions with regard to the history of\r\nthe eighteenth century in particular have been so valuable to me, I\r\ndesire to tender my most hearty and grateful thanks. To Dr. Donald\r\nMacalister (Fellow and Lecturer of St. John’s College) and Mr. Oscar\r\nBrowning, M.A. (Fellow and Lecturer of King’s College) I owe much for\r\nkindly encouragement and advice and assistance in many ways, while I am\r\nindebted to Mr. G. E. Green, M.A. (St. John’s College), for his labour\r\nin revising proofs and the ready help he has given me through the many\r\nyears in which he has acted as my private tutor.\r\n\r\nThe chief works which I have used are Professor Seeley’s “Expansion of\r\nEngland,” Hon. Evelyn Ashley’s “Life of Lord Palmerston,” and Professor\r\nHolland’s “European Concert in the Eastern Question.” The latter I have\r\nconsulted specially for the history of treaties.\r\n\r\n                                                             M.

This truth, however, escapes the\r\neyes of ninety-nine out of a hundred, just as did the importance of\r\nEastern Europe in 1790, and of Central Asia in 1857. In the former case\r\nEngland did not appreciate the danger of a Russian aggression of Turkey,\r\nand so Pitt’s intervention in the Turkish Question failed. It was\r\notherwise in the second half of the nineteenth century, when the Crimean\r\nWar and the Berlin Congress proved great events in English history. In\r\n1857 the national feeling in England was not aroused as to the\r\nimportance of defending Persia from foreign attack. Lord Palmerston had\r\nwritten to Lord Clarendon, Feb. 17, 1857, “It is quite true, as you say,\r\nthat people in general are disposed to think lightly of our Persian War,\r\nthat is to say, not enough to see the importance of the question at\r\nissue.” How strongly does the Afghan question attract the public\r\nattention of England at the present day?\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that in 1857 very few in England were awake to the\r\nvital importance of withstanding Russian inroads into the far East,\r\nviz., the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAfter defeating Russia miserably in the Crimean War and driving her back\r\nat the Balkans by the Treaty of Paris, Lord Palmerston’s mind was now\r\nrevolving and discussing the following serious thought: “Where would\r\nRussia stretch out her hands next?”\r\n\r\nI think I am not wrong in stating the following as Lord Palmerston’s\r\nsolution of the problem:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) That Russia was about to strike the English interests at\r\nAfghanistan by an alliance with Persia.\r\n\r\n(_b_) That she would attack the Afghan frontier single-handed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) That an alliance would be formed with the Chinese, and a combined\r\nhostility against Britain would be shown by both.\r\n\r\n(_d_) She would extend her Siberian territory to the Pacific on the\r\nnorth, thereby obtaining a seaport on that ocean’s coast, and make it an\r\noutpost for undermining English influence in Southern China.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore in 1856 Lord Palmerston declared war against Persia remarking\r\nthat “we are beginning to reveal the first openings of trenches against\r\nIndia by Russia.”[1]\r\n\r\nThis policy proved a winning one. The Indian Mutiny of 1857, however,\r\nscarcely gave Palmerston time to mature his Afghan Frontier scheme,\r\nconsequently his views with regard to that country were to a great\r\nextent frustrated by Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1856, the _Arrow_ dispute gave Palmerston his\r\nlong-wished for opportunity of gaining a stronghold in the South China\r\nSea. He declared war on China. The causes of this dispute on the English\r\nside were morally unjust and legally untenable. Cobden brought forward a\r\nresolution to this effect—that “The paper laid on the table failed to\r\nestablish satisfactory grounds for the violent measure resorted to.”\r\nDisraeli, Russell, and Graham all supported Cobden’s motion. Mr.\r\nGladstone, who was also in favour of the motion, said, at the conclusion\r\nof his speech, “with every one of us it rests to show that this House,\r\nwhich is the first, the most ancient, and the noblest temple of freedom\r\nin the world, is also the temple of that everlasting justice without\r\nwhich freedom itself would only be a name, or only a curse, to mankind.\r\nAnd I cherish the trust that when you, sir, rise in your place to-night\r\nto declare the numbers of the division from the chair which you adorn,\r\nthe words which you speak will go forth from the halls of the House of\r\nCommons as a message of British justice and wisdom to the farthest\r\ncorner of the world.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, it certainly seems to me, only viewed the matter from a\r\nmoral point of view. If we look at it in this light, then the British\r\noccupation of Port Hamilton was a still more striking example of English\r\n“loose law and loose notion of morality in regard to Eastern nations.”\r\n\r\nPalmerston was defeated in the House by sixteen votes, but was returned\r\nat the general election by a large majority backed by the aggressive\r\nfeelings of the English nation.\r\n\r\nHe contended that “if the Chinese were right about the _Arrow_, they\r\nwere wrong about something else; if legality did not exactly justify\r\nviolence, it was at any rate required by _policy_.”[2] He described this\r\npolicy in the following way—“To maintain the rights, to defend the lives\r\nand properties of British subjects, to _improve our relations with\r\nChina_, and in the selection and arrangement of those objects to perform\r\nthe duty which we owed to the country.”\r\n\r\nThis is easy to understand, and showed at any rate a disposition, in\r\nfact a wish, for the Anglo-Chinese alliance.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Pekin was finally concluded in 1860, the terms of which\r\nwere—Toleration of Christianity, a revised tariff, payment of an\r\nindemnity, and resident ambassadors at Pekin.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the policy of Palmerston in the Chinese War,\r\nRussia took it as indirectly pointed at herself.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ignatieff[3] was sent to China immediately as Russian\r\nPlenipotentiary. It is said that he furnished maps to the allies, in\r\nfact did his very best to bring the negotiations to a successful and\r\npeaceful close, and immediately after the signing of the agreement, he\r\ncommenced overtures for his own country, and succeeded in obtaining from\r\nChina the cession of Eastern Siberia with Vladivostock and other\r\nseaports on the Pacific (1858).\r\n\r\nLord Elgin asked Ignatieff why Russia was so anxious to obtain naval\r\nports on the Pacific. He replied: “We do not want them for our own sake,\r\nbut chiefly in order that we may be in a position to compel the English\r\nto recognize that it is worth their while to be friends with us rather\r\nthan foes.”\r\n\r\nHere began the struggle between England and Russia in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Russia obtained the Saghalien[4] Island, in the North Pacific,\r\nfrom Japan, in exchange for the Kurile Island, while England was\r\nbombarding[5] Kagoshima, a port in South Japan (1862), but the English\r\nwere virtually repelled from there.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this period the English policy in Asia was to establish a\r\nfirm hold of Indian commerce with the South China Sea, for she could not\r\nfind so large and profitable a field of commerce elsewhere. Therefore\r\nthe English attention for the time being was entirely directed in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the island of Singapore, as well as all the seas, straits, and\r\nislands lying within ten miles of its coast, were ceded to the British\r\nby the Sultan of Johor. It then contained only a few hundred piratical\r\nfishermen, but now it is on the great road of commerce between the\r\neastern and western portions of Maritime Asia, and is a most important\r\nmilitary and naval station.\r\n\r\nHong Kong, an island off the southern coast of China, was occupied by\r\nthe English, and in 1842 was formally handed over by the Treaty of\r\nNankin. It has now become a great centre of trade, besides being a naval\r\nand military station.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Labuan, the northern part of Borneo, was ceded to Great Britain\r\nby the Sultan of Borneo, and owing to the influence of Sir James Brooke\r\na settlement was at once formed. Now it also, like Singapore, forms an\r\nimportant commercial station, and transmits to both China and Europe the\r\nproduce of Borneo and the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nOwing to the opening of seaports in Northern China for foreign trade in\r\n1842, the growing Russian influence in the Northern Pacific and many\r\nother circumstances caused England to perceive the necessity of having a\r\nnaval depôt and commercial harbour on the Tong Hai and on the Yellow\r\nSea. England was doubtless casting her eyes upon the Chusan Island or\r\nsome other island in the Chusan Archipelago, but did not dare to occupy\r\nany one of them lest she should thereby offend the chief trading nation\r\nof that quarter, viz., China.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1885 England annexed Port Hamilton, on the southern coast of\r\nthe Corea, during the threatened breach with Russia on the Murghab\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Port Hamilton,” said the author of “The Present Condition of European\r\nPolitics,”[6] “was wisely occupied as a base from which, with or without\r\na Chinese alliance, Russia could be attacked on the Pacific. It is vital\r\nto us that we should have a coaling station and a base of operations\r\nwithin reach of Vladivostock and the Amoor at the beginning of a war, as\r\na guard-house for the protection of our China trade and for the\r\nprevention of a sudden descent upon our colonies; ultimately as the head\r\nstation for our Canadian Pacific railroad trade; and at all times, and\r\nespecially in the later stages of the war, as an offensive station for\r\nour main attack on Russia.”\r\n\r\nPort Hamilton forms the gate of Tong Hai and the Yellow Sea; it cannot,\r\nhowever, become a base of operations for an attack on the Russian force\r\nat Vladivostock and the Amoor unless an English alliance is formed with\r\nJapan. The above writer shows an ignorance of the importance of the\r\nsituation of Japan in the Pacific question. Japan holds the key of the\r\nNorth China Sea and Japan Sea in Tsushima.[7] She has fortified that\r\nisland, and placed it in direct communication with the naval station of\r\nSasebo, also with the military forces of Kumamoto. She also can send\r\ntroops and fleets from the Kure naval station and the garrison of\r\nHiroshima. She would also, if required, have other naval stations on the\r\ncoast of the Japan Sea ready for any emergency. In this manner she would\r\nbe able to keep out the British fleet from attacking Vladivostock and\r\nthe Amoor through the Japan Sea. Even if she might not be able to do\r\nthis single-handed she certainly could by an alliance with Russia.\r\n\r\nIf also Japan occupied Fusan, on the south-eastern shore of the Corea,\r\nthe Japan Sea would be rendered almost impregnable from any southern\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAgain, Port Hamilton would be useless as a head station for the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway trade without an Anglo-Japanese alliance. If you look at\r\nthe map, you can easily appreciate the situation. Japan, with many\r\nhundreds of small islands, lies between 24° and 52° in N. lat., its\r\neastern shores facing the Pacific and cutting off a direct line from\r\nVancouver’s Island to Port Hamilton. It must therefore depend mainly\r\nupon Japan as a financial and political success.\r\n\r\nJapan is now divided into six military districts, while the seas around\r\nit are divided into five parts, each having its own chief station in\r\ncontemplation. The Government are now contemplating establishing a\r\nstrong naval station at Mororan in Hokkukaido, for the defence of the\r\ndistrict and also the shore of the northern part of the mainland,\r\nespecially of the Tsugaru Strait. The strait of Shimonoseki also has\r\nbeen fortified and garrisoned on both sides, and has close communication\r\nfrom the Kure naval station, and with Hiroshima, and Osaka. Railway\r\ncommunication has also made great strides during the last few years, and\r\nrapid transit has consequently greatly improved throughout the empire.\r\n\r\nIf the Kiushiu, the Loo Choo, and the Miyako Islands are well looked\r\nafter by the Japanese fleet from the Sasebo naval station, then Japan\r\nwould be able to sever the communication between Vancouver’s Islands and\r\nPort Hamilton, and also between the former place and Hong Kong to a\r\ncertain extent. The San-Francisco-Hong Kong route would be injured, and\r\nShanghai-Port-Hamilton line would be threatened. Without doubt _Japan is\r\nthe Key of the Pacific_.\r\n\r\nReviewing the discussion, we find that Port Hamilton is rather useless\r\nwith regard to the Japan Sea and the Canadian Pacific railway road\r\nwithout a Japanese alliance, but it would be of immense importance in\r\nwithstanding a Russian attack on the British interests from the Yellow\r\nSea through Mongolia or Manchooria. It is also an excellent position for\r\nany offensive attack upon China in case of war breaking out.\r\n\r\nThe British occupation of Port Hamilton was very galling to the Chinese\r\nnation, in fact, quite as disagreeable as the occupation of Malta and\r\nCorsica was to Italy, and the annexing of the Channel Islands and\r\nHeligoland to France and Germany. It has therefore somewhat shaken the\r\nAnglo-Chinese alliance.\r\n\r\nA Chinese alliance, however, is of far greater importance for English\r\ninterests than the occupation of Port Hamilton. If relations became\r\nstrained a severe blow would be dealt to English trade and commerce in\r\nthat part. The main portion of the commercial trade of China is with the\r\nUnited Kingdom and her colonies; for instance, in 1887, the imports of\r\nChina from Great Britain, Hong Kong, and India amounted to about\r\n89,000,000 tael, while the exports to the same countries were 48,000,000\r\ntael. It is hardly possible to find two countries more closely connected\r\nby trade than England and China.[8] The Hamilton scheme was wisely\r\nabandoned in 1887, and the English Government obtained a written\r\nguarantee from China against a Russian occupation in future years.\r\n\r\nViscount Cranbrook said in his reply to a question asked by Viscount\r\nSidmouth: “That the papers to which he referred did contain a written\r\nstatement, and a very long written statement on the part of the Chinese\r\nGovernment giving the guarantee in question. It was not a mere verbal\r\nstatement by the Chinese Government, but a very deliberate note. It was\r\nfound that the Chinese had received from the Russian Government a\r\nguarantee that Russia would not interfere with Corean territory in\r\nfuture if the British did not, and the Chinese Government were naturally\r\nin a position, on the faith of that guarantee by the Russian Government,\r\nto give a guarantee to the British Government. The Marquess of\r\nSalisbury, on the part of her Majesty’s Government, had accepted it as a\r\nguarantee in writing from the Chinese Government.”\r\n\r\nThis policy was undoubtedly an exceedingly wise and good one. By this\r\nEngland not only regained a firm and complete commercial alliance, but\r\nalso maintained and strengthened a political alliance against Russian\r\nattacks from the Corea and indirectly from Manchooria and Mongolia.\r\n\r\nEngland also saved money by the abandonment of the Port Hamilton scheme,\r\nand saved her fleet from being, to a certain degree, scattered in such a\r\nfar-off quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nEngland now holds complete sway both commercially and navally in the\r\nPacific. Lord Salisbury’s policy is worthy of all praise, together with\r\nMr. Gladstone’s original scheme. If the scheme had never been originated\r\nthere would not have been so firm an Anglo-Chinese alliance as there now\r\nis.\r\n\r\nEngland’s power at the present time is three times as great as that of\r\nRussia in the Pacific; in fact Russia has always been overweighted in\r\nthat respect. Therefore it is selfevident she could never be able to\r\nwithstand the combined Anglo-Chinese fleets.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the only feasible plan for a Russian attack on\r\nAnglo-Chinese alliance would be from Mongolia and Manchooria by means of\r\nan alliance with the Mongolian Tartars. This would be preferable to\r\ncoping with England face to face in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nChinese history plainly tells us that the Chinese could not withstand an\r\nattack of the brave Mongol Tartars from the north, and that they have\r\nproved a constant source of dread to them.\r\n\r\nThe Great Wall which stretches across the whole northern limit of the\r\nChinese Empire from the sea to the farthest western corner of the\r\nProvince of Kansal, was built only for the defence of China against the\r\nnorthern “daring” Tartars.\r\n\r\nGhenghis Khan (1194), the rival of Attila, in the extent of his kingdom,\r\nwho overran the greater part of China and subdued nearly the whole of N.\r\nAsia, who carried his arms into Persia and Delhi, drove the Indians on\r\nto the Ganges, and also destroyed Astrakhan and the power of the\r\nOttoman, was a Mongolian Tartar.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century Kokpitsuretsu invaded China from Mongolia and\r\nformed the Gen dynasty which ruled over the whole eastern part of Asia\r\nexcept Japan (1280 to 1368). The founder of the present Chinese dynasty\r\nwas a Manchoorian. Both, however, were of Mongolian extraction, and well\r\nkept up the fame of the Tartars for boldness and general daring. Since\r\ntheir times the Tartars have fully maintained their title of being the\r\nmost warlike tribe in Asia.\r\n\r\nTherefore if Russia were allied with the Mongol Tartars she would be\r\nable at least to reach the Yellow Sea, even if she were not able to do\r\nChina serious harm.\r\n\r\nHer best policy would be to extend the Omsk-Tomsk Railway[9] to Kiakhta\r\n_viâ_ Kansk and Irkutsk, and from there to Ust Strelka and\r\nBlagovestchensk through Nertchinsk; a branch also might be thrown off\r\nfrom Kiakhta to Oorga, in the direction of Pekin, the metropolis of\r\nChina; two branches might also be constructed from Nertchinsk—(_a_) to\r\nIsitsikar, through the western boundary of Manchooria, with the ultimate\r\nobject of reaching some convenient harbour on the Gulf of Leaotong, or\r\nthe Yellow Sea, _viâ_ Kirin[10] and Moukden—(_b_) to L. Kulon through\r\nthe northern boundary of Mongolia in the direction of Pekin; and to\r\nconstruct a branch line from Blagovestchensk to Isitsikar _viâ_ Merghen.\r\n\r\nBy these means Russia would not only open sources of untold wealth in\r\nSiberia, but also secure a larger field of commerce in Manchooria and\r\nMongolia than she has done by the opening of the Trans-Caspian Railway.\r\nIt is clear that there would be more political and strategical\r\nadvantages in this quarter, than in Central Asia. Should Russia ever be\r\nable to get possession of a seaport in the Gulf of Leaotong or in the\r\nYellow Sea, she would deal a heavy blow against the Anglo-Chinese\r\nalliance, and ultimately frustrate, to a great extent, British\r\naspirations in the East.\r\n\r\nRussia, however, has worked in quite a different way, and is\r\nstrengthening the defences at Vladivostock both in military and naval\r\nforces, and is acting towards the Corea in a gradually-increasing\r\naggressive spirit, which had succeeded in Europe and Central Asia\r\npreviously for more than one hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nLord Derby well described the Russian tactics in the following\r\nspeech:—“It has never been preceded by storm, but by sap and mine. The\r\nfirst process has been invariably that of fomenting discontent and\r\ndissatisfaction amongst the subjects of subordinate states, then\r\nproffering mediation, then offering assistance to the weaker party, then\r\ndeclaring the independence of that party, then placing that independence\r\nunder the protection of Russia, and finally, from protection proceeding\r\nto the incorporation, one by one, of those states into the gigantic body\r\nof the Russian Empire.”\r\n\r\nBut Russia should remember that a Russian annexation of Corea—“the\r\nTurkey” in Asia—would necessitate an alliance of England, China, and\r\nJapan, who all possess common interests in the Pacific and Yellow Sea;\r\nalso that it might cause a second Crimean war in the Pacific instead of\r\non the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nJapan was comparatively unknown until Commodore Perry, of the United\r\nStates, introduced her to European society in 1854. Since that date a\r\n“wonderful metamorphosis” has taken place in every branch of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe total area of Japan is about 148,742 square miles, or nearly a\r\nquarter greater than that of the United Kingdom, while the population is\r\nabout 38,000,000. The climate is very healthy, while the natural\r\nresources are many.\r\n\r\nJapanese patriotism is very keen, and their love of country stands\r\nbefore everything; they are brave, honest, and open-minded. The\r\nfollowing facts bear out the above statement: In 1281 the “Armada of\r\nMongol Tartars” reached the Japanese shores, only to be easily repulsed\r\nin Kiushiu by the Japanese fleet. Hideyoshi in the sixteenth century\r\nconquered the Corea, and General Saigo defeated and subjugated eighteen\r\nof the resident chiefs with all their followers in Formosa (1873).\r\n\r\nOne of the great traits in the Japanese character is that they never\r\nhesitate to adopt new systems and laws if they consider them beneficial\r\nfor their country. Feudalism was abolished in 1871 without bloodshed. In\r\n1879 city and prefectural assemblies were created, based on the\r\nprinciple of the election. The new Constitution was promulgated in 1889,\r\nand new Houses of Peers and Commons will be opened this year (1890).\r\n\r\nRailways are rapidly growing, over 1,000 miles already having been laid,\r\nand soon the whole country will be opened out by the “iron horse.” All\r\nthe principal towns are connected by telegraph[11] with one another and\r\nwith Europe. The postal system[12] is carried out on English lines,\r\nwhile the police force is strong and very efficient. The standing army\r\nconsists of about forty-three thousand men, which, however, could be\r\nquickly increased to two hundred thousand in case of war, all trained\r\nand equipped under the European system. The navy consists of thirty-two\r\nships, including several protected cruisers, and in this or next year it\r\nwill be reinforced by three more ironclads and five or six gunboats. The\r\nJapanese navy is organized chiefly upon the pattern of the English navy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE PACIFIC & ITS SEA ROUTES.]\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation and condition of Japan are very favourable to\r\nher future prosperity, both commercially and from a manufacturing point\r\nof view. Look at a map of the world—the country lies between two of the\r\nlargest commercial nations, viz., the United States and China, the\r\nformer[13] being England’s great commercial rival of the present day,\r\nwhile the latter offers a large field for trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nIf M. de Lesseps’ scheme of the Panama Canal should happen to be\r\ncompleted on his Suez Canal line, undoubtedly the Pacific Ocean would be\r\nrevolutionized in every way. Up to now the waterway from Europe to the\r\nPacific has been from the West, viz., _viâ_ the Suez Canal, or the Cape\r\nof Good Hope.\r\n\r\nBut in case of the “gate of the Pacific” being open, then European goods\r\ncould be transported in another direction, and the nations in the\r\nPacific would have two sea routes. Japan would be placed practically in\r\nthe _centre_ of _three large markets_—Europe, Asia, and America—and its\r\ncommercial prosperity would be ensured.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Panama scheme failed from one cause or another there\r\nwould be another sea route.[14]\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the American Senate sanctioned the creation of a company for the\r\nconstruction of a maritime canal across Nicaragua,[15] and the actual\r\nwork was begun in October, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe President of the country, which has a surplus of 57,000,000 dollars,\r\nalluding to the commencement of the Nicaragua Canal said in his message\r\nto the Senate:—\r\n\r\n“This Government is ready to promote every proper requirement for the\r\nadjustment of all questions presenting obstacles to its completion.” It\r\nis therefore pretty sure, sooner or later, to be completed, and would\r\ntake the place of the Panama Canal and give the same advantages with\r\nregard to the Pacific and Japan.\r\n\r\n“In the school of Carl Ritter,”[16] said Professor Seeley, “much has\r\nbeen said of three stages of civilization determined by geographical\r\nconditions—the potamic, which clings to rivers; the thalassic, which\r\ngrows up around inland seas; and lastly, the oceanic.” He also traced\r\nthe movements of the centre of commerce and intelligence in Europe, and\r\nat last found out why England had attained her present greatness.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, since the discovery of a new world the whole world has\r\nbecome the oceanic.\r\n\r\nBut the discoveries of Watt and Stephenson, seem to me to have added\r\nanother stage to general civilization, viz., the railway; and it seems\r\nalso to me that we might call the present era “the railway-oceanic.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway scheme was completed in 1887. It has a\r\ntotal length of at least 3,000 miles, starting from Quebec and finishing\r\nat Vancouver’s Island on the Pacific. Its marvellous success will also\r\nconsiderably change the general tenor of the Pacific even more than the\r\nPanama or Nicaragua scheme will do. An express train can cross in five\r\ndays, while the voyage from Vancouver to Yokohama in Japan, would only\r\noccupy twelve days steaming at the rate of fourteen or fifteen knots an\r\nhour. From England the whole journey to Shanghai and Hong Kong by this\r\nroute would take only thirty-four or thirty-five days, and Australia now\r\nhas direct communication with the mother country through a sister\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nLast of all, Japan would have much better communication with the\r\nEuropean markets generally than is possible at the present time, if the\r\nEnglish proposed[17] mail steamers should run, and it is said that the\r\nCanadian Pacific route would bring Japan within twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-seven days’ reach of England.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the Russian Siberian Railway scheme should be\r\ncarried out to the Pacific at Vladivostock, it would open a very large\r\nfield of trade and commerce with inland Siberia to Japan. It would be\r\nstill more so if the Chinese railways were extended so as to open the\r\nentire empire.[18]\r\n\r\nJapan has not only a splendid future before her with regard to\r\ncommercial greatness, but has every chance of rising to the head of\r\nmanufacturing nations. In the latter respect she has advantages over\r\nVancouver’s Island and New South Wales, her rivals on the Pacific. She\r\nis known to possess valuable mineral resources, having good coal mines\r\nat Kiushiu and Hokkukaido. The climate of Japan varies in different\r\nlocalities, but on the whole is exceedingly healthy. Consisting as the\r\ncountry does of numerous islands she has many good harbours and trading\r\nports. Wages are low though they might rise if a corresponding increase\r\nof labour is required. The credit system is fairly well carried out[19]\r\nand is growing day by day. There are about four hundred banks, including\r\nthe Bank of Japan; and the medium of exchange has a regular standard.\r\nThe principal exports are silk, tea, coal, and rice. Japan is not the\r\nproducer of raw goods for manufacturing purposes, but simply works them\r\nup. Her area is not in comparison with the commercial greatness which\r\nshe will attain in the future. She may import raw goods from America,\r\nAustralia, and the Asiatic countries, in the same way that England does.\r\nHer position enables her also to obtain wool from Australia and\r\nCalifornia, also cotton from China, Manchooria, India, and Queensland.\r\nAll these imports are worked up into different manufacturing goods. She\r\nhas an advantage here over England, for she has not so far to send her\r\nmanufactured goods, and does not need, like England, to send them all\r\nround the world.\r\n\r\nThus we see Japan has ample scope from a commercial point of view, and\r\nhas plenty of friendly countries close at home for the production of her\r\nraw material, and has great advantages in sea routes to America and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are born sailors, being islanders.\r\n\r\nThere are several large steamship companies[20] whose ships are\r\ncontinually plying along her own shores[21] and also to the mainland of\r\nChina, and one company contemplates shortly opening communication with\r\nNorth and South America. It has often puzzled me why Japan does not hold\r\ncloser relations with Australia, especially as Australia is becoming one\r\nof her most important neighbours in commerce. I can certainly predict\r\nthat if this suggestion comes to pass, that together they will in the\r\nfuture hold the key of the Pacific trade.\r\n\r\nAustralia and her near colonies have already begun to play an important\r\npart in the affairs of the Pacific; and why should she not, considering\r\ntheir natural wealth and general progress? European Powers have begun to\r\ntake great interest, both commercially and diplomatically, in these\r\ncolonies. England, France, Spain, and Holland long ago saw the advantage\r\nof having secured coaling stations in the Pacific, and England and\r\nFrance have always taken great care in selecting posts in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the sea route between America and Australia; and since the\r\nworking of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Panama Canal, they have\r\nbegun to annex those islands which lie near the route from Panama to the\r\nAustralian colonies, and from the latter to Vancouver. The French\r\noccupation of Tahiti and the Rapa (both containing good harbours) in\r\n1880 was with the distinct object of controlling the sea route from\r\nPanama to Sydney, Brisbane, and Auckland. England also began to fortify\r\nJamaica in 1887, and she is now casting her eyes on Raratonga. The\r\ndispute regarding the New Hebrides and the Samoan Conference[22] were\r\nsimply for the protection of the Vancouvan-Australian-San-Franciscan\r\nsea-ways. England has lately annexed the Ellice Islands and undoubtedly\r\nwill shortly occupy the Gilbert and Charlotte Islands.\r\n\r\nGermany also has been considering the Asiatic-Australian routes,\r\nforeseeing that the whole Pacific question rests on that basis. In 1884\r\nshe annexed New Guinea, and the Bismarckian policy proved a severe blow\r\nto the British power in the North and West Pacific. There are three\r\ngreat sea routes from New South Wales to Hong Kong and other parts of\r\nthe North Pacific; one travels eastward of the Solomon Islands and New\r\nCaledonia (6,000 miles) and the other two westward of the\r\nabove-mentioned islands (5,500 and 5,000 miles).\r\n\r\nThe German occupation of New Guinea actually resulted in her having the\r\nentire control of these three important sea routes. The English\r\npossession of the Treasury Islands, the depôt made there, and of the\r\nLouisiade Archipelago is certainly not strong enough to protect these\r\nroutes, though they are very important for the defence of the Australian\r\ncolonies. Even the trade route from Vancouver’s Island to Brisbane has\r\nto a certain extent been endangered. It would be policy on England’s\r\npart to annex the Solomon Islands if she means to regain the prestige\r\nwhich she has lost owing to the Germanic policy of annexation in the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nIn order to firmly establish her power in this quarter, Germany, in\r\n1885, raised a quarrel with Spain concerning the sovereignty of the\r\nCaroline and Pelew Islands, but this quarrel was composed by the\r\nmediation of the Pope.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great “preferred regiments, as a ship cost as much as a\r\nregiment.” Bismarck preferred “the Greater Germany,” and his policy was\r\n“the German trade with the German flag” (_i.e._, the German flag shall\r\ngo where German trade has already established a footing). This policy\r\nproved very successful, not only in the West Pacific, but also in the\r\nNorth Pacific and the eastern coast of Africa. Germany now is the chief\r\ncolonizing rival of England.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Mr. Chester annexed all the parts of New Guinea with the\r\nadjacent islands lying between 141 deg. and 155 deg. of E. long. Lord\r\nDerby; however, annulled this annexation, regarding it as an unfriendly\r\nact, and he also assured the Colonial Government that “Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment are confident that no foreign power contemplates interference\r\nin New Guinea.” This occurred in May, 1884. But this prognostication did\r\nnot prove true, for in November of the same year Germany occupied New\r\nGuinea.\r\n\r\nThis caused much public indignation in the English colonies against the\r\nHome Government, and the public of England recognized that the reasons\r\nand complaints of the Australian Colonies were right and just.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Imperial Federation sprang up in England, the chief\r\nobject of which was “a closer association between the Colonies and Great\r\nBritain and Ireland for common national purposes such as colonial and\r\nforeign policy, defence and trade.” The result of this was the Colonial\r\nConference in 1887; and Lord Salisbury, offering a hearty welcome to the\r\nColonial delegates, said: “I do not recommend you to indulge in schemes\r\nof Constitution making;” but also said: “It will be the parent of a long\r\nprogeniture, and distant councils of the empire may, in some far-off\r\ntime, look back to the meeting in this room as the root from which their\r\ngreatness and beneficence sprang.”\r\n\r\nThe following subjects were submitted for discussion: (1) The local\r\ndefence of ports other than Imperial coaling stations; (2) the naval\r\ndefence of the Australian Colonies; (3) measures of precaution in\r\nrelation to the defences of colonial ports; (4) various questions in\r\nconnection with the military aspects of telegraph cables, their\r\nnecessity for purpose of war, and their protection; (5) questions\r\nrelating to the employment and training of local or native troops to\r\nserve as garrisons of works of defence; and, lastly (6), the promotion\r\nof commercial and social relations by the development of our postal and\r\ntelegraphic communication.\r\n\r\nThus, by means of this Conference, the military federation of the\r\nBritish Empire was established. By its efforts the English squadron in\r\nthe China Sea and in the Australian seas are more closely connected\r\ntogether than they have been before, and, if needed, the English forces\r\nin the North Pacific would be reinforced by Australian troops. We saw an\r\ninstance of this in the late Egyptian campaign.\r\n\r\nOne more question remains to be ventilated, viz., whether England is\r\nable to secure absolute power in the North Pacific with the naval and\r\nmilitary forces she has at her command there, using Hong Kong as the\r\ncentre of war preparations.\r\n\r\nI answer in the negative. It could be maintained only by an occupier of\r\nthe Island of Formosa, the “Malta” of the North Pacific, which lies\r\nbetween the North China Sea and the South China Sea. Its area is\r\nestimated at 14,978 square miles. It has a healthy climate, tempered by\r\nthe influence of the sea and its mountains. Coal is to be found in\r\nconsiderable quantities, although not of the best quality. Its natural\r\nproducts are plentiful, such as sugar, tea, and rice. It possesses\r\nseveral good harbours, one of which, Tam-sui, or Howei, is surrounded by\r\nhills upwards of 2,000 feet high, and has a depth of 3½ fathoms with a\r\nbar of 7½ feet.\r\n\r\nFrom this island, with a good navy, any power almost might be exerted\r\nover the North and South China Seas, and over the Pacific highways from\r\nHong Kong to Australia, Panama, Nicaragua, San Francisco, Vancouver,\r\nJapan, Shanghai. All these are in fairly close proximity to Formosa, and\r\nthe Shanghai route to Hong Kong actually runs between the island and the\r\nChina mainland.\r\n\r\nThere remain still two or three more facts which must not be neglected\r\nin order to obtain a fair view of this important question.\r\n\r\n(_a_) It is a fine post for any offensive attack upon China, and also a\r\nstronghold for an attack upon the British power in the Pacific. If\r\nfortified and defended by a navy from any other power, Formosa would\r\nprove a great rival to Hong Kong, which would lose at least half of its\r\nimportance, commercially and strategically, and which has already been\r\nsomewhat weakened by the French occupation of Cochin China, in 1882.[23]\r\n\r\n(_b_) In case of Asiatic complications, England would naturally expect\r\nreinforcements from Australia, and from the mother country by the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway, but after they arrive at Vancouver, and are on\r\ntransport, they will be at the mercy either of Japan or the occupier,\r\nwhoever it may be, of Formosa. Even the Bismarckian policy _re_ New\r\nGuinea would be broken down, _i.e._, all commercial and strategical\r\ncommunication between Hong Kong and Australia would be seriously\r\nincommoded by the occupation of Formosa.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If China herself occupied Formosa thoroughly,[24] and allied with\r\nJapan who occupies the Loo Choo Islands, they would be impregnable in\r\nthe sea above 20° of N. lat.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the occupier of the Loo Choo Islands[25] also occupied Formosa\r\non a military basis, she again would have nearly absolute control of the\r\nNorth Pacific. England would be supreme if she held both Hong Kong and\r\nFormosa; Germany if the holder would not only complete the Bismarckian\r\npolicy in New Guinea, but would start a new Germanic policy in the North\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThus we see that Japan, China, England, and Germany, might become\r\nimportant actors in the China Sea, while Russia and China would be\r\nactors behind the scenes in Manchooria and Mongolia.\r\n\r\nThe whole result of a historical study of the foreign policy of England\r\nand Russia tells us that Russia has increased her influence by annexing\r\nand conquering in every[26] direction of the compass with Moscow as the\r\ncentre of the Empire. Peter the Great started in the direction of the\r\nBaltic, _i.e._, north-west; Catherine II. towards the Crimea and Poland\r\nin a south and westerly direction; Alexander I. confined his attention\r\nto the Balkans and Caucasus, while Nicholas improved on the same\r\ndirections, and marched into Central Asia, and since 1858 the Russian\r\nattention has been turned on the East, _i.e._, the Pacific.\r\n\r\nEngland, on the other hand, has added to her fame by establishing the\r\nfollowing naval and coaling stations along the great highways of trade:—\r\n\r\nHeligoland in the North Sea, the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, Malta,\r\nCyprus, Perim, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong and Labuan; the\r\nAccession Islands, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa; the\r\nBermuda Islands, Halifax, the West Indies, especially Jamaica, and the\r\nFalkland Islands in America, besides many important islands in the South\r\nand West Pacific.\r\n\r\nBy means of these, in the present days of steam, she has been able to\r\nmaintain her place as the Queen of the Maritime World—a position\r\nsuperior to Russia, although the latter country is lord of one-seventh\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\nWith such great rivals, we can surely predict that at some future time\r\nRussia will work her way into Manchooria and Mongolia to the Yellow Sea\r\nand attack the North Pacific. “Everything is obtained by pains,” said\r\nPeter the Great, in 1722; “even India was not easily found after the\r\nlong journey round the Cape of Good Hope.”[27] To this Soimonf, who\r\nafterwards devoted himself for seventeen years to the exploration of\r\nSiberia, and was its governor, said that “Russia had a much nearer road\r\nto India, and explained the water system of Siberia, how easily and with\r\nhow little land carriage goods could be sent from Russia to the Pacific\r\nand then by ships to India.” Peter replied, “It is a long distance and\r\nof no use yet awhile.” But in the present days of telegraphy and\r\nrailroads it is not a great distance at all.\r\n\r\nEngland will without doubt occupy Formosa in order to uphold her power\r\nin the same quarter. The result it would be almost impossible to\r\nforetell. But this fact remains a certainty that will one day come to\r\npass, that England and Russia will at some future period fight for\r\nsupremacy in the North Pacific. Japan lies between the future\r\ncombatants!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II.\r\n                        _THE EASTERN QUESTION._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n    FOREIGN POLICY OF ENGLAND DURING THE SIXTEENTH, SEVENTEENTH, AND\r\n                         EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES.\r\n\r\n  _The Spanish Empire, its power, and its decline—Commercial rivalry of\r\n    England and Holland—The ascendency of France; threatened by the\r\n    Grand Alliance—The Spanish succession and the Bourbon\r\n    league—England’s connection with the war of the Austrian\r\n    succession—The Seven Year’ War—Revival of the Anglo-Bourbon struggle\r\n    in the American and Napoleonic wars._\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles V. of Spain in the height of his power reigned over almost the\r\nwhole of Western Europe. Besides being King of Spain he was Archduke of\r\nAustria, Duke of Burgundy, and Lord of Spanish-America. “The Emperor,”\r\nsaid Sir William Cecil, “is aiming at the sovereignty of Europe which\r\ncannot be obtained without the suppression of the reformed religion, and\r\nunless he crushes the English nation he cannot crush the Reformation.”\r\nPerceiving this important fact, Charles directed his attention to\r\nEngland, and offered the hand of his son Philip to Mary of England who\r\nwas anxious to bring back the Catholic Faith into England.\r\n\r\nTheir marriage took place in 1554, and proved a great help towards\r\nre-establishing the Papal supremacy in England, besides making Spain and\r\nEngland strong political allies.\r\n\r\nCharles V. abdicated in 1555 and spent the rest of his life in seclusion\r\nat San Yusti, and the great part of his dominions, viz., the Colonies,\r\nItaly, and the Netherlands descended to his son, Philip II., who was by\r\nhis marriage with Mary nominal King of England.\r\n\r\nOn the childless death of Mary the English crown descended to Elizabeth\r\nin 1558. Philip thereupon offered marriage to her, but the virgin queen\r\nwisely declined. England was by this refusal emancipated from Papal\r\ninterference and the tyrannies of Philip, and Elizabeth resolved to\r\ncarry out her religious and political views independently. Her\r\ndoctrinal[28] reform and foreign policy naturally made Spain her bitter\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands Philip’s general conduct raised the inhabitants to\r\nrevolt, and under the leadership of the Prince of Orange they soon\r\nobtained a strong position, and eventually, in 1648, after a long and\r\nprotracted struggle, their independence was recognized.\r\n\r\nThus the two great sea powers of Philip’s age were both common enemies\r\nagainst the arrogance of Spain and were consequently united.\r\n\r\nIn France a similar religious struggle, fierce and bitter, was raging.\r\nCivil war was rampant and atrocities numerous, the massacre on St.\r\nBartholomew’s Day being a notable example. In 1585 the Catholic party\r\nformed the “League,” whose main objects were the annihilation of the\r\nreformed party, and the elevation of the Guises to the French throne\r\nthrough an alliance with Philip II. of Spain. Its manifesto stated that\r\nFrench subjects were not bound to recognize a prince who was not a\r\nCatholic. The death of Henri III. made the situation worse, for two\r\ncandidates for the French throne appeared,—Henry of Navarre, who was\r\nsupported by the Huguenots and the Cardinal of Bourbon, whom the\r\nLeaguers followed, while Philip II. laid claim to the throne on behalf\r\nof his daughter by his third marriage with Elizabeth of Valois, sister\r\nof Henri III. Hence, after the accession of the House of Bourbon, a\r\ncoalition of England, Holland, and France was formed against Philip II.\r\nof Spain, and from 1600 to 1660 the European coalition was England,\r\nHolland, and France, _versus_ the Spanish Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Spain had acquired Portugal in 1580, by which both\r\ncountries became one state, and Philip II. sovereign of the whole\r\noceanic world. Portugal for sixty years remained a dependency of Spain,\r\nand then the Spanish Empire had attained to vast and unwieldy\r\ndimensions. She could no longer defend her colonies from foreign\r\ninvasion and plunder. The Dutch established themselves wherever they\r\npleased, and plundered and occupied most of the Portuguese possessions.\r\nIt has been truly said that the Colonial Empire of Holland was founded\r\nat the expense first of Portugal, and ultimately of Spain.[29]\r\n\r\nEngland at this time was rapidly rising into the front rank of European\r\nnations. In 1588 the “Invincible Armada” appeared in the English Channel\r\nand was annihilated and disgraced. This was the introduction to that\r\nEnglish colonial greatness on which the sun never sets.\r\n\r\nThen came the beginning of the fall of the Spanish Empire. In 1640\r\nCardinal Richelieu, the ablest French statesman, provoked Portugal to\r\nrebel, his object being the aggrandizement of his own country abroad.\r\nThe revolt proved successful under John of Braganza, and again Portugal\r\nposed as a nation. This proved a deadly blow to Spanish power, and\r\nCromwell finally crushed her power by his invincible foreign policy. He\r\nseized Jamaica while Charles II. acquired Bombay.\r\n\r\nThis gradual decay of Spain had a corresponding inspiriting effect on\r\nEngland and Holland. Both became commercial and colonial rivals one with\r\nanother. Ashley Cooper said, “Holland is our great rival in the ocean\r\nand in the New World. Let us destroy her though she be a Protestant\r\nPower; let us destroy her with the help of a Catholic Power.”[30]\r\n\r\nThe great naval victories of England and the Navigation Acts, 1651,\r\n1663, and 1672,[31] crushed the Dutch carrying trade and navy, and\r\nEngland now began to assume the supremacy of the whole oceanic world\r\nwhich has from that time never departed from her.\r\n\r\nHowever, France gradually filled the breach left by Holland and Spain,\r\nand became a great naval rival of England. The strength of all the\r\nnations round her had been considerably weakened by the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, while her commercial and manufacturing progress soon made her one\r\nof the strongest European Powers.\r\n\r\nFrom 1660 to 1672 may be regarded as the period of the great national\r\nrise of France. Louis XIV. laid claim to Belgium and Burgundy in 1665 on\r\nthe death of Philip IV. of Spain, and in order to enforce his claim his\r\narmy entered Flanders and Burgundy, but owing to the pressure of the\r\nTriple Alliance[32] the unfavourable Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nHowever, later on Louis broke the Triple Alliance and secured the\r\nvaluable assistance of England and Spain, and with the assistance of the\r\nformer nation he made a concerted attack upon Holland. France had now\r\nreached the topmost rung of the ladder between 1678 and 1688.\r\n\r\nAbout this period the struggle against absolute monarchy was nearly\r\nconcluded in England, and was further strengthened in 1689 by the\r\nDeclaration of Rights. The English crown was offered to William of\r\nOrange and Mary and accepted by them. Already this personal union had\r\ncaused an alliance to be formed between England and Holland, at that\r\ntime the two great Protestant Powers of Europe, against France the great\r\nRoman Catholic upholder.\r\n\r\nIf France had remained quiet during the above-mentioned internal\r\ndiscord, England would have been unable to form the “Grand Alliance.”\r\nThus Louis committed a great error in assuming an offensive attitude\r\nagainst the two Protestant Powers. This caused a coalition to be formed\r\nagainst him of England, Holland, Spain, and Austria.\r\n\r\nThis new system in Europe existed from 1688 to 1700. Then new\r\ncomplications arose, for Charles II., King of Spain, died childless, and\r\nthe extinction of the Spanish House of Hapsburg seemed to be near at\r\nhand. The question of a Spanish successor now occupied the minds of the\r\nEuropean cabinets after the Peace of Ryswick.\r\n\r\nThere were three claimants: Louis XIV., Leopold I., and the Electoral\r\nPrince of Bavaria. The dominions of the Spanish sovereign were still\r\nextensive, viz., Spain itself, the Milan territory, Italy, the\r\nNetherlands, and Spanish-America. To unite the Spanish monarchy with\r\nthat of France or Austria, would destroy the European balance of power.\r\nConsequently a general council with regard to the succession took place,\r\nand the First Partition Treaty was drawn up. Charles II. of Spain,\r\nhowever, made a will, appointing Louis’ grandson, Philip of Anjou, as\r\nhis successor, so Louis XIV. determined to uphold the will rather than\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\nIn 1701 the Duke of Anjou was peacefully proclaimed king as Philip V.\r\nLouis XIV. on hearing this boasted that “Il n’y a plus de Pyrenees.”\r\nThis Bourbon succession in Spain changed the European system, and\r\nhenceforth we have England, Holland, and Austria, as opposed to France\r\nand Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Marlborough, who combined the qualities of a general,\r\ndiplomatist, and minister skilfully together, was the leader of the\r\nSecond Grand Alliance against the Houses of Bourbon.\r\n\r\nThe inability of France to defend the Spanish Empire, followed by the\r\nWar of the Spanish Succession, paved the way for the Peace of Utrecht\r\n(1713). By this treaty the Bourbons lost Italy and the Low Countries,\r\nbut retained the throne of Spain, thus still leaving that country open\r\nto the influence of France. Hence the permanent alliance of France and\r\nSpain was formed in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Holland had fallen into decay through internal exhaustion\r\ncaused by her struggle against foreign enemies; thus England had taken\r\nher place as the great maritime and colonial power. Thus we see the\r\nstruggle between England and France (supported by Spain) for the oceanic\r\nworld in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBy the Utrecht Treaty, France ceded to England Newfoundland, Arcadia,\r\nand Hudson’s Bay territory, while Spain also ceded Gibraltar, the\r\nMinorca Island, and the Asiento, the occupation of the two former making\r\nanother bitter enemy to England.\r\n\r\nSpain had already a hatred of English trade with her colonies in\r\nAmerica, so that only a single English ship was conceded by the Treaty\r\nof Utrecht, giving thereby only a limited right of trade in South\r\nAmerica to England. But this was evaded by a vast system of smuggling\r\nwhich arose and proved a constant source of dispute between England and\r\nSpanish revenue officers and rendered peace almost impossible.\r\n\r\nIn 1733 the first secret _pacte de famille_ had been concluded between\r\nFrance and Spain for the ruin of English maritime trade. The American\r\ncoast was keenly watched, and the result was “The Jenkins’ Ear War,”\r\n1739.\r\n\r\nCharles VI., having no son, established an order of succession by the\r\nPragmatic Sanction, signed by nearly all the European Powers, by which\r\nhis daughter, Maria Theresa, was to succeed to all the hereditary\r\ndominions of Hapsburg. But on his death two claimants appeared on the\r\nscene—the Elector of Bavaria and Philip V. of Spain.\r\n\r\nWalpole did his best to form a Grand Alliance between Hanover and\r\nPrussia, also between England, Holland, and Austria. However,\r\nFrederick’s claim to Silesia being refused by Austria, the French and\r\nPrussian armies crossed the Rhine, 1741. Thus France began the War of\r\nthe Austrian Succession. In 1743 the Battle of Dettingen was fought\r\nbetween England and France, the former fighting on behalf of Maria\r\nTheresa, and as yet feeling her way carefully before she was brought\r\ninto direct conflict with the latter Power.\r\n\r\nAfter the Treaty of Worms the question at issue was changed to that of\r\nnaval supremacy, and the War of the Austrian Succession fell into the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, after an attempted invasion of England on behalf of the\r\nPretender, France declared war against both England and Austria. This\r\nwas bad policy, for if she had fought against one enemy at a time she\r\nwould have stood a far better chance of crushing England’s power.\r\nProfessor Seeley says, “If we compare together those seven wars between\r\n1688 and 1815, we shall be struck with the fact that most of them were\r\ndouble wars, and that there is one aspect between France and England,\r\nanother between France and Germany.... It is France,” says he, “that\r\nsuffers by it.”[33]\r\n\r\nEngland and Holland firmly allied with one another, and German troops\r\nwere subsidized by England.\r\n\r\nAgainst this alliance the second secret _pacte de famille_ was founded.\r\n\r\nBattles were fought on all sides, by land and sea, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica. In spite of French successes at Fontenoy and Laufeldt, she was\r\nseverely defeated both on the sea and in America. Louisburg fell, Cape\r\nBreton Island was captured, and many other losses sustained. At length\r\nthe Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle brought a nominal peace into the oceanic\r\nworld, in 1748.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 this nominal peace came to an end, and the Seven Years’ War[34]\r\nwas fought out, both in the Old and New Worlds; Pitt the elder then\r\nappeared as a great actor on England’s side, and used his great talents\r\nto crush down the French Colonial Empire, and to obtain for his country\r\nthe sole mastery of the oceanic world.\r\n\r\nHe was essentially a war Minister: “The war was vigorously carried on\r\nthroughout 1758 in every part of the globe where French could be found,\r\nand in 1759 Pitt’s energy and his tact in choosing men everywhere were\r\nrewarded by the extraordinary success by land and sea.”[35]\r\n\r\nThe glorious death of Wolfe on the Heights of Abraham was followed by\r\nthe surrender of Montreal and the brilliant victory of Plassey in India\r\nby Clive over the French. Pitt assured his countrymen that “they should\r\nnot be losers” (in giving pecuniary assistance to Frederick the Great)\r\n“and that he would conquer America for them in Germany.”\r\n\r\nThis proved true. In 1762 the fall of the French Colonial Empire\r\noccurred, and England obtained Canada and India.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful statesman[36] undoubtedly made England the first country\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Three Wars of Revenge._\r\n\r\n“A height of prosperity and glory unknown to any former age,”[37] was\r\nreached in England during the administration of Chatham. Now the tide of\r\nfortune began to run against England.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the famous Stamp Act, and many other “repeated injuries\r\nand usurpations,”[38] made the relations between England and the\r\nAmerican Colonies virtually hostile. At last the Colonies revolted, and\r\nit gave Spain and France the long-wished-for opportunity of taking\r\nrevenge upon England. France and Spain formed the third _pacte de\r\nfamille_, and assisted the insurgent Colonies, and the independence of\r\nthe United States was acknowledged in 1783.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the French Revolution broke out, and the first effect felt in\r\nEngland was the breaking-up of the Whig party.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Austria and Prussia invaded France in order to put down the\r\nRepublicans in that country. In retaliation France determined to declare\r\nwar against all countries governed by kings, which principle she\r\nestablished by the “Decree of November 19th,” and in 1793 she declared\r\nwar against England and Holland.\r\n\r\nThe younger Pitt had now come to the front. He was an economist and\r\nadvocated a peace policy. In the spring of 1792 he reduced the navy and\r\nconfidently looked forward to at least fifteen years of peace. There is\r\nno doubt that if France had remained quiet his hopes would have proved\r\ncorrect, and that the west bank of the Rhine would now be under French\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nBut France was eager to revenge past injuries put upon her by England;\r\nand, as if in answer to her desires, the second Alexander the Great\r\nappeared in Napoleon, and began “alarming the Old World with his\r\ndazzling schemes of aggrandizement.”\r\n\r\nAgainst England his whole energies were directed. “Let us be masters,”\r\nsaid he, “of the Channel for six hours and we are masters of the\r\nworld.”[39] In 1798, he captured Malta, occupied Egypt, and undertook a\r\ncampaign in Syria, as a furtherance to his desires of obtaining India,\r\nat the same time retaining his ideas with regard to England. Malta to\r\nEgypt, Egypt to India, India to England.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 a momentary universal peace occurred. But Napoleon could not\r\nrest, his ambition spurred him on. His anger was again kindled by the\r\nEnglish retention of Malta, after his defeat in Egypt, and he saw if\r\nMalta was wrested from him his lofty schemes would be undermined. In\r\n1803 he again declared war against England and Holland. He arrested all\r\nthe English residents in France between the ages of sixteen and sixty\r\nand kept them confined.\r\n\r\nThe younger Pitt was just the statesman fit to cope with him, and\r\nfrustrate his aims. He aimed at a European coalition,[40] by which all\r\nthreatening dangers from the overwhelming greatness of one nation might\r\nbe averted.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1805, the glorious victory at Trafalgar, the outcome and\r\nconsummation of Nelson’s inspiring command, “England expects every man\r\nto do his duty,” broke the naval power of France. And yet this was\r\nfollowed by the capitulation of Ulm, the defeat at Austerlitz, and the\r\nsubsequent Treaty of Presburg, which broke up the coalition of England,\r\nRussia, and Austria, and seriously affected Pitt’s health thereby.\r\nTruly, “Austerlitz killed Pitt.”[41]\r\n\r\nAt once Napoleon proceeded to turn the whole forces he had on the\r\nContinent against England, especially after the Peace of Tilsit, (1807).\r\nHe first attacked England with the “Continental System,” _i.e._, he\r\nprohibited all direct and indirect European trade with the British\r\nIsles. This he confirmed by the Decrees of Berlin (1806) and Milan\r\n(1807).\r\n\r\nIn 1812 he invaded Russia and entered the famous city with the cry of\r\n“Moscow! Moscow!” Even at that moment, however, his real aim of attack\r\nwas England, across the Channel.\r\n\r\nEngland was ever uppermost in his thoughts. “He conquers Germany, but\r\nwhy? Because Austria and Russia, subsidized by England, march against\r\nhim while he is brooding at Boulogne over the conquest of England. When\r\nPrussia was conquered, what was his first thought? That now he has a new\r\nweapon against England, since he can impose the Continental System upon\r\nall Europe. Why does he occupy Spain and Portugal? It is because they\r\nare maritime countries, with fleets and colonies that may be used\r\nagainst England.”[42]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was driven out of Moscow by fire, and his return march turned\r\nliterally into a defeat, while his plan of a direct attack in England,\r\nthrough Belgium, three years after, was frustrated at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThus the scene of the great Napoleonic drama in English history closed\r\non June 18, 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\nFOREIGN POLICY OF RUSSIA DURING THE REIGNS OF PETER THE GREAT, CATHERINE\r\n                         II., AND ALEXANDER I.\r\n\r\n  _Peter the Great, and establishment of Russian power on the\r\n    Baltic—Consequent collision with the Northern States and the\r\n    Maritime Powers—Catherine II. and Poland—First partition—Russia\r\n    reaches the Black Sea—Russo-Austrian alliance against Turkey opposed\r\n    by Pitt—Second and third partitions of Poland—Rise of\r\n    Prussia—Alexander I. and the conquest of Turkey—Treaty of\r\n    Tilsit—Peace of Bucharest—Congress of Vienna—French influence in the\r\n    East destroyed._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Peter the Great_ (1689–1725).\r\n\r\nThe Russian territory now extends over one-seventh of the globe, and\r\nAlexander III. rules over more than 100,000,000 souls. Russia is a\r\npowerful political rival not only of England alone, but of all the\r\nEuropean Powers.[43]\r\n\r\nHowever, on Peter the Great’s accession to the throne, his country\r\ncovered an area of only 265,000 square miles, and no harbours were to be\r\nfound either on the Baltic or the Black Sea. This was felt to be a\r\nserious obstacle for a rising Power. Peter himself said, in the preface\r\nto the “Maritime Regulations”: “For some years I had the fill of my\r\ndesires on Lake Pereyaslavl, but finally it got too narrow for me. I\r\nthen went to the Kubensky Lake, but that was too shallow. I then decided\r\nto _see the open sea_ and began often to beg the permission of my mother\r\nto go to Archangel.”[44] His first and great object was to establish\r\nharbours on the Baltic or the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were the preliminary object of his attack. The first campaign\r\nagainst Azof (1695) proved a failure, but a new campaign was started\r\nagain in 1696, and the Czar’s “bravery and his genius” were rewarded\r\nwith a great victory over Azof. Here begins the modern history of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE EXPANSION OF RUSSIA IN EUROPE.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the capture of Azof Peter determined to carry out his\r\ndesign of creating a large fleet on the Black Sea. For the purpose, “no\r\nsooner had the festivities in Moscow ended than, at a general council of\r\nthe boyars, it was decided to send 3,000 families of peasants and 3,000\r\nstreltsi and soldiers to populate the empty town of Azof and firmly to\r\nestablish the Russian power at the mouth of the Don. At a second council\r\nPeter stated the absolute necessity for a large fleet, and apparently\r\nwith such convincing arguments, that the assembly decided that one\r\nshould be built. Both civilians and clergy were called upon for\r\nsacrifices.”[45]\r\n\r\nPeter also sent fifty men of the highest families in Russia to Italy,\r\nHolland, and England, to study the art of ship-building. Peter himself\r\nvisited Holland and England that he might learn ship-building. “One\r\nthing, however, he could not learn there, and that was the construction\r\nof galleys and galliots, such as were used in the Mediterranean, and\r\nwould be serviceable in the Bosphorus and on the coast of the Crimea.\r\nFor this he desired to go to Venice.”[46] This clearly shows us that\r\nPeter had conceived the idea of establishing a strong navy on the Black\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of the streltsi recalled him home; however, he found no\r\ndifficulty in suppressing the insurrection.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he sent an envoy to the Ottoman Empire to obtain permission\r\nfor the Russian fleet to enter the Black Sea, to which the Porte\r\nreplied: “The Black Sea and all its coasts are ruled by the Sultan\r\nalone. They have never been in the possession of any other Power, and\r\nsince the Turks have gained sovereignty over this sea, from time\r\nimmemorial no foreign ship has ever sailed its water, nor ever will sail\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles XII., King of Sweden, began to assume an attitude of\r\nhostility to Peter, and the Battle of Narva was fought, where Peter was\r\nmiserably defeated. After this war, Charles made Russia the great object\r\nof his attack instead of Poland. He said, “I will treat with the Czar at\r\nMoscow.” Peter replied, “My brother Charles wishes to play the part of\r\nAlexander, but he will not find me Darius.” The Battle of Pultawa (1709)\r\nsoon decided Peter’s superiority, and the Peace of Nystadt (1721) added\r\nthe Baltic provinces and a number of islands in the Baltic to Russia.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 “a great window for Russia to look out at Europe”—so Count\r\nAlgaratti called St. Petersburg—was made by Peter on the marshes of the\r\nNeva. This step firmly established Russian power on the Baltic.\r\n\r\nBut to establish Russian power on the Baltic at all was as great a\r\nmistake as ever has been committed by so shrewd a statesman as Peter the\r\nGreat. The predominance of Russia in the Baltic with her strong navy\r\nthreatened the interest of the commerce and carrying-trade of the\r\nEnglish and Dutch. Hence it was natural enough that England and Holland,\r\ntwo great maritime powers, should have joined to protect their interest\r\nin the Baltic as well as the integrity of Sweden against Russian\r\naggression. In the case of the Northern War, England had formed an\r\nalliance with Sweden and sent her fleet to the Baltic under command of\r\nAdmiral Norris to prevent the Russian sway on those waters.\r\n\r\nHad Peter thought less of the importance of the Baltic, and concentrated\r\nhis energies on obtaining a sure foothold in the Crimea, Constantinople\r\nwould now be a Russian southern capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Catherine II._ (1762–1796).\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years’ War had been brought to a finish when Catherine II.\r\nascended the Russian throne. The next great European complication was\r\nbrought about by the affairs of Poland.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Augustus III., Stanislaus Poniatowski was elected King\r\nof Poland, and at the request of Prussia and Russia the dissenters,\r\nadherents of the Greek Church and the Protestants, received all civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this a Confederation of Bar was formed in 1768, with\r\nthe object of dethroning the King. Catherine now began to interfere with\r\nPoland on behalf of the Greek Christians, and supported the King with\r\nher Russian army. This interference made her practically mistress of\r\nPoland. Turkey, an ally of the Confederacy, being alarmed at the growing\r\nRussian influence and being urged on by France, declared war upon Russia\r\nin order to resist the progress of Catherine in Poland; but this proved\r\ndisastrous, as she was miserably defeated, both on land and sea, and\r\nbrought to the verge of ruin. This Russian success alarmed Western\r\nEurope, and especially the two neighbouring Christian Powers, Prussia\r\nand Austria, each of whom had a special interest in the existence of\r\nPoland and Turkey. Catherine would not make peace without acquiring\r\nterritory as a compensation for her exertions and outlay, while Prussia\r\nand Austria would not allow her to do this unless they acquired a\r\ncertain amount of territory themselves. Hence the First Partition of\r\nPoland took place, by which the three Powers secured equal\r\naggrandizement, Russia receiving the eastern part of Lithuania as her\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 the Treaty of Kutschouk Kainardji was concluded with Turkey, by\r\nwhich the independence of the Mongol Tartars in the Crimea was\r\nacknowledged by the Sultan; Russia obtained the right of protection over\r\nall the Christian subjects of the Porte within a certain limit, and also\r\nthe right of free navigation in all Turkish waters for trading vessels.\r\nThis treaty firmly planted Russia on the northern coasts of the Black\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 the Crimea was incorporated with Russia, and in 1787 Catherine\r\nvisited the southern part of Russia as far as Kherson, on the Black Sea.\r\nJoseph II. of Austria, on hearing of her approach to his dominions,\r\nhastened to meet her, and together they journeyed through the Crimea,\r\nthe Czarina unfolding to the Emperor both her own plans and those of\r\nPotemkin, her favourite, viz., to expel all the Turks from Europe,\r\nre-establish the old Empire of Greece, and place her younger grandson\r\nConstantine on the throne of Constantinople. Joseph fell in with her\r\nview, and it was hinted that something like a Western Empire should be\r\nalso constituted and placed under the Austrian sway. In this way a\r\ndivision of the Ottoman Empire was contemplated between the two\r\ncountries. This soon aroused the suspicions of Turkey, and war was again\r\ndeclared. But now it was two against one, and the fate of Turkey again\r\nseemed sealed.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt was the first statesman who directly opposed Russia and\r\ntendered assistance to Turkey against Russian encroaching power. His\r\nforeign policy of opposition to Russia has been followed more or less by\r\ngenerations of English Ministers. The Triple Alliance of England,\r\nPrussia, and Holland was formed by Pitt against the “Colossus of the\r\nNorth,” in order to preserve the balance of power in Europe, and the\r\ndeath of Joseph. II., saved Turkey again. Pitt, by means of this\r\nAlliance, demanded that a peace be made between Russia and Turkey on the\r\n_status quo ante bellum_, and threatened to maintain his demand by arms.\r\nThe English people, however, cared very little about a Russian invasion\r\nof Turkey, while Catherine disregarded Pitt’s threats.\r\n\r\nSoon after a peace between Russia and Turkey was concluded at Jassy, by\r\nwhich Turkey ceded Oczakow and the land between the Dnieper, Bug, and\r\nDniester, containing several good harbours, and notably Odessa; the\r\nprotectorate of Russia over Tiflis and Kartalinia was also recognized.\r\n\r\nBy the above-mentioned acquisitions she felt certain that very soon\r\nConstantinople would be in her hands. However, a nearer, and, in her\r\nopinion, a more important matter engaged her attention. In 1792 the new\r\nConstitution of Poland was drawn up by Ignaz Potocki, converting the\r\nElective Monarchy into an hereditary one, the House of Saxony supplying\r\na dynasty of kings. The Confederacy of Jargowitz, which was formed in\r\nopposition to this new Constitution, called in the help of Russia.\r\n\r\nThis now seemed to be a grand opportunity for Russia to finally annex\r\nPoland, because the deaths of Frederick the Great (1786) and Joseph\r\n(1790), and the French Revolution, which occupied the attention of all\r\nWestern Europe, set the Czarina free from her most watchful rivals. A\r\nRussian army invaded Poland, and the new Constitution was repealed.\r\nPrussian troops also entered Poland under the pretence of suppressing\r\nJacobinism, and Russia again found herself frustrated, and concluded a\r\nSecond Partition (1793) with Prussia, by which she received Lithuania,\r\nVolhynin, and Podolia.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 the Polish nation rebelled, under the leadership of Xoscruscko,\r\nand this led to a Third Partition between Russia, Prussia, and Austria,\r\nand the former Power added 181,000 square miles, with 6,000,000\r\ninhabitants, together with Curland, to her already vast dominions.\r\n\r\nBy this last Partition a road of aggression was open towards Sweden on\r\nthe north-west, and towards Turkey on the south.\r\n\r\nMany combined circumstances led Russia to assume an aggressive policy\r\ntowards Turkey specially. Sweden, or rather Finland, was not of\r\nsufficient importance as a prey to the “northern bear”—a warmer climate\r\nwas also wanted. Catherine had already discovered the mistaken policy of\r\nPeter the Great, who had spent all his energy in getting the strongholds\r\nof the Baltic in opposition to Charles XII. of Sweden. Russian sway on\r\nthe Baltic meant a direct opposition from two great sea Powers, viz.,\r\nEngland and Holland, whose interests would suffer thereby. A striking\r\nproof of the opposition was seen in the case of the Northern War.\r\n\r\nThe Partition of Poland produced another stray Power in the Baltic, to\r\nwit, Prussia.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Partition of Poland, Prussia Proper and her dominions,\r\nBrandenberg and Silesia, were separated, Poland being between them. The\r\nFirst Partition joined the Prussian kingdom to the main body of the\r\nMonarchy; by the Second and Third Partitions Prussia obtained the then\r\nSouth Prussia and East Prussia, thereby uniting all into one compact\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThus unconsciously a powerful Russian enemy was being formed in the\r\nBaltic. Thus Russia had three great enemies—England, Holland, and\r\nPrussia, joined by Sweden and Denmark, on the Baltic.\r\n\r\nCatherine had already obtained a firm footing on the Black Sea coast,\r\nand was confident of her ability to occupy Constantinople and make it a\r\nRussian southern capital; the French Revolution attracting the attention\r\nof Western Europe, the Ottoman Empire was left at the mercy of Russia.\r\nAgain a Russian occupation would give a fine prospect of extending\r\nRussian authority into Danubian territory, Central Asia, and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nSo we may conclude that Catherine’s annexation of Poland was only a step\r\ntowards attaining her great aim, and gave her time to mature her plans.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Catherine died, and was succeeded by Paul (1796). He\r\nreversed his mother’s policy by concluding an alliance with Turkey\r\nagainst Napoleon, seeing that the latter’s policy was to destroy the\r\nTurkish Empire for the benefit of France. He changed his policy later,\r\nhowever, after his unsuccessful campaign in Holland, and threw himself\r\ninto Napoleon’s arms by establishing an armed neutrality in the north\r\nagainst England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Alexander I._ (1801–1825).\r\n\r\nCatherine died (1796), but her plan did not perish with her. Alexander\r\nI. proved a faithful expounder of the late Czarina’s schemes.\r\n\r\nHis strong-handed policy was chiefly directed against Armenia and the\r\nPersian frontier, although the Danubian territory, Poland and Finland,\r\ndid not escape his watchful eyes. Mingrelia and Imeretia were conquered\r\nin 1803, Shiroan in 1805–1806.\r\n\r\nAt last Alexander’s policy took a definite form at the Treaty of Tilsit\r\n(1807), for by the first provision “Russia was to take possession of\r\nTurkey in Europe, and push on her conquests in Asia as she thought\r\nproper.” This secret treaty, which was made with Napoleon I., caused\r\ngreat uneasiness in England, and a coolness sprang up between the two\r\nPowers (1807–1812), although England had adhered to an Anglo-Russian\r\nAlliance during Chatham’s administration, and Alexander joined the\r\ncoalition of 1805.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Russia gained Finland, with the whole of East Bothnia and part\r\nof West Bothnia, as far as the River Tornea, by the Treaty of\r\nFriedrichsham. The Peace of Bucharest (1812) was the result of England’s\r\nmediation, by which Russia added Bessarabia, and the Pruth was made the\r\nboundary between Russia and Turkey, while Russia gave up Moldavia and\r\nWallachia, which at that time were occupied by her.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Russia and France concerning the “Continental\r\nSystem”[47] brought about a French invasion of Russia by 678,000 men\r\n(1812). But Russia coped successfully with her powerful foe.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) met to restore the balance of power\r\nand regulate the European relations, and also established the “Pentarchy\r\nof the Great Powers.” Eight nations signed the Act of the Congress of\r\nVienna, by which Russia was, generally speaking, the greatest gainer,\r\nfor she received the greater part of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw.\r\n\r\nAt the Congress of Vienna, Castlereagh (the English representative)\r\nevidently had in view three aims—(1) to prevent any revival of the\r\nContinental System; (2) to protect English communication with India; and\r\n(3) to maintain her supremacy in the Mediterranean. For the first aim,\r\nEngland obtained Heligoland, and the kingdom of the Netherlands was\r\nformed, and “the surrender of Java was made to the Dutch by way of\r\nincreasing the wealth and power of that kingdom, and so helping to\r\nre-establish the due counterpoise to French power which nature has given\r\nto the possession of the Low Countries”; for the second aim, England\r\nalso obtained the possession of Cape Colony (from the Dutch) and the\r\nMauritius (from France) to render safe the road to India; and for the\r\nthird aim, England retained Malta, and also the seven Ionian islands\r\nwere brought under English protection.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Waterloo stamped out Napoleon’s[48] ambitious schemes.\r\nFrench power and influence in Eastern Europe vanished with Napoleon, and\r\nfrom that time France has not fully recovered, and is therefore unable\r\nto settle the Eastern Question for her benefit. The Napoleonic plan of\r\noccupying Constantinople has been stolen by Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n                        THE NEW EUROPEAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n  _The concert of the Great Powers; its aims—It does not protect small\r\n    states from its own members_, e.g., _Polish Revolution—How far can\r\n    it solve the Turkish question?_\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon the Great fell at the Battle of Waterloo, 1815. The “concert of\r\nthe Great Powers,” the primary object of which is to avoid the\r\nrecurrence of universal war in Europe, was first established at the\r\nCongress of Vienna in the same year. This new European System is,\r\nhowever, only applicable to the case of a small Power or Powers, but not\r\nto the Great Powers themselves. For instance, in the Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nas well as the Franco-Prussian War, none of the other Great Powers could\r\ninterfere, and matters were entirely left to themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EASTERN EUROPE & WESTERN ASIA.]\r\n\r\nBut in the case of a lesser state or states becoming breaker of the\r\npeace, the Great Powers have never hesitated to step in and settle the\r\ndifference according to their mutual agreement. We see good instance of\r\nit in the Independence of Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe “concert of the Great Powers” is actually a second phase of the Holy\r\nAlliance, and the new system has usually its object the protection of a\r\nsmaller state against the larger. Greek Independence was a singular\r\nexample of the new system. The revolt of Greece was entirely suppressed\r\nby the Sultan, and there was no hope of freeing themselves from the\r\nTurkish yoke. Though hardly justifiable, the Great Powers at last\r\ninterfered, and made Greece an independent state. The Independence of\r\nItaly was another example.\r\n\r\nThus we see that under the new system now prevalent in Europe, a smaller\r\nstate _at least_ attains her end.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the Polish Revolution against Russia. The Poles said, Let\r\nus revolt. We shall undoubtedly be beaten by Russia; but we don’t mind\r\nthat at all, because we shall _at last_ attain our own end through the\r\ninterference of the Great Powers. There was every reason for the event\r\nturning out as they had calculated. Louis Napoleon was the first\r\nEuropean sovereign who interfered in the Polish Revolution, and he\r\ninvited England to join him. England, however, declined, owing to the\r\ndifficulties of the situation. France, from her isolation, failed in her\r\ndesires, and Louis Napoleon lost his European confidence. Truly the fall\r\nof the French Empire began from that date.\r\n\r\nThis Polish Revolution disclosed another characteristic of the new\r\nEuropean System. In the event of either country concerned being one of\r\nthe Great Powers, the system is of no effect at all. The late dispute\r\nbetween England and Portugal comes under this heading.\r\n\r\nOne more interesting question needs investigation. How far this new\r\nEuropean System is applicable to the question of Turkey, a country which\r\nmay be placed among the first-class Powers, and where Christian\r\ninhabitants are in an inferior position to the Turkish Mahomedans. This\r\nis what I have to discuss in the following five chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n                          GREEK INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n  _The Holy Alliance—The Greek insurrection—Interference of the Three\r\n    Powers—Battle of Navarino—Treaty of Adrianople—The policy of\r\n    Nicholas I.; Treaty of Unkiar Ikelessi—Turkey only saved by English\r\n    and French aid—Palmerston succeeds to Canning’s policy._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander I., Emperor of Russia; Francis, Emperor of Austria; and\r\nWilliam I., King of Prussia, formed what was known as the Holy Alliance,\r\nthe first-named being the chief instigator.\r\n\r\nIts aim was to promote peace and goodwill among European nations, based\r\nupon Christianity, although it seemed quite liable to be abused for the\r\nbenefit of absolute monarchy, as in the case of Spain. Nearly all the\r\nEuropean Powers joined it, England[49] being the only one who declined.\r\nEngland’s argument was that “such interference is inconsistent with the\r\nfundamental laws of Great Britain. It must lead to a system of continual\r\ninterference incompatible with European interests and the independence\r\nof nations.”[50] However, we are forced to admit and acknowledge that\r\nthe present system of Europe is conducted on the same lines, slightly\r\nmodified, as the Holy Alliance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century the songs of the poet Rhegus and\r\nthe revolutionary influence of France (1789) stirred up the Greeks to\r\nfeelings of hatred against the Porte.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the Danubian Provinces (Roumania), under the leadership of\r\nHypisilands, rose in rebellion, trusting to receiving assistance from\r\nAlexander I., the instigator of the Holy Alliance. But their hopes were\r\nshattered, and Turkey soon crushed the revolt. This was the only case in\r\nwhich Russia did not interfere with Turkey in the Danubian question.\r\n\r\nA little reflection, however, will show the cause of the Russian\r\nnon-interference in this case. Alexander’s power and influence were\r\ndeclining, and Russia was filled internally with discontent. Secret\r\nsocieties flourished everywhere, and the Czar dreaded a revolution in\r\nhis own country if he gave help to the Danubian Provinces, which would\r\nbe approving a rebellion against a legitimate sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Greek rising in the Morea was answered by a counter Turkish massacre\r\nof Greeks in most of the principal cities of Turkey, and Gregory, the\r\nhead of the Greek Church at Constantinople, was executed. This caused\r\ngreat indignation in the Russias and war appeared imminent, but owing to\r\nthe mediation of England and Austria it was averted.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Russia felt that it was to her advantage to\r\nassist a revolutionary movement, in order that she might secure as much\r\ninfluence in Turkey as possible. But Austrian interest in the Balkans\r\nwas of vital importance. Her policy was naturally to oppose Russia in\r\nher desires, in order to keep the Turkish honour unstained and use her\r\nas a bulwark against Russia.\r\n\r\nHowever, great enthusiasm was aroused, not only in England, but also in\r\nGermany and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nLord Byron died,[51] and Shelley wrote for the Greek cause. Lord\r\nCochrane and Sir Richard Church fought, while the German poet, Müller,\r\nand the Swiss Eynard, warmly upheld the cause of the oppressed Greeks.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this help, the Greeks were far from fortunate, and the\r\nSultan, with the help of the Egyptians, captured Athens. But their brave\r\ndefence of Missolonghi aroused the sympathies of the European Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Nicholas I._ (1825–1855).\r\n\r\nOn the death of Alexander I. the Holy Alliance vanished (1825), and\r\nNicholas I. ascended the throne (1825–1855). Now the Greeks appealed to\r\nEngland for help, and Canning[52] saw that it was the best policy for\r\nEngland to assist Greece in order to control the ambitious plans of\r\nRussia. Accordingly he sent the Duke of Wellington as the English\r\nrepresentative, and a protocol was signed at St. Petersburg by which\r\nGreece was to remain tributary to the Sultan, but to be independent as\r\nregards commercial relations. This protocol developed into the Treaty of\r\nLondon, between England, France, and Russia, by which the three Powers\r\nbound themselves to act as mediators in the Eastern question. The\r\nmediation of the Powers was rejected by the Porte, but accepted by the\r\nGreeks. The result was that the Turko-Egyptian fleet was totally\r\ndestroyed at the Battle of Navarino by the allies, and the Sultan\r\nretreated from the Morea. Canning’s death in 1827 gave England an\r\nopportunity of retiring from active participation in the alliance,\r\nespecially as she regarded the Battle of Navarino as an “untoward\r\nevent,” so Russia and Turkey were left alone in conflict.\r\n\r\nThis, in my opinion, was a half-hearted policy on the part of England,\r\nalthough the Cabinet at that time could do no other, because their\r\ntenets would not allow them to help a revolutionary people against a\r\ncountry governed by a legitimate sovereignty.\r\n\r\nNow had the long-wished-for opportunity arrived for Russia to carry into\r\neffect on Turkey her long-cherished designs. Diebitch, a Russian\r\ngeneral, crossed the Balkans, and soon captured Adrianople; while\r\nPaskevitch took Kars and Erzeroom in Asia.\r\n\r\nThese successes resulted in the Treaty of Adrianople (1829), between\r\nRussia and Turkey. By the treaty[53] Russia gave back almost all her\r\nconquests to Turkey, only retaining the ports of Anapa and Poti, on the\r\neastern coast of the Black Sea, and the Protectorate powers of the Czar\r\nover the Danubian Principalities were confirmed and extended. In return\r\nTurkey acquiesced in all the provisions of the London Conference.\r\n\r\nThis made Greece practically an independent state.\r\n\r\nNicholas pursued the policy of Alexander I. with regard to the Asiatic\r\nboundaries, and successfully carried on a war with Persia from 1826 to\r\n1828 which was terminated by the Treaty of Turkmantchai (1828), Russia\r\nreceiving the provinces of Erivan and Nakhitcheven. This was the period\r\nof the expansion of Russia, and the first appearance of Russia as a real\r\nrival of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nReviewing the general policy of Nicholas the reader cannot help being\r\nstruck with the skilful manner and clever system by which the Czar\r\ncarried out his plans.\r\n\r\nBefore his reign the Russian attacks were all made particularly in the\r\nsouth-west and south-east direction, viz., the Danubian territory, and\r\nArmenia; but on his accession he began to attack from a more southerly\r\ndirection even than Turkey, viz., Greece, whom he assisted in rebellion\r\nagainst her Turkish oppressors. From 1826–1828 he attacked in a\r\nsouth-easterly quarter, viz., Armenia and Persia, at the same time\r\noccupying Adrianople and threatening Constantinople. Finally, to\r\ncomplete his plans, he struck a fatal blow at the heart of Turkey, viz.,\r\nits capital, Constantinople, in 1833, with the Treaty of Unkiar\r\nSkelessi, by which Turkey was practically made a vassal of Russia.\r\n\r\nThis treaty exercised a great influence upon foreign powers. For Russia\r\nby it would have obtained actual possession not only of the Black Sea\r\nbut also of its only entrance, the Dardanelles, which thus would have\r\nbecome a fortified Russian outpost.\r\n\r\nTurkey now was in a very precarious state. She was almost past the aid\r\nof any earthly powers. But luckily two doctors stepped into the breach,\r\nnamely, England and France, and, after a course of treatment, the\r\nfollowing protocol was indited by the Pentarchy of Powers: “That ships\r\nof war have at all times been prohibited from entering the Channel of\r\nConstantinople, viz., by the Straits of the Dardanelles and of the Black\r\nSea.”\r\n\r\nReshid Pacha had performed for Turkey great internal reforms, but,\r\nunfortunately, he was exiled through a Court intrigue. This proved a\r\ngreat blow to Turkish politics.\r\n\r\nThus Turkey began to decline again; and, as John Bright said in an able\r\nspeech at Manchester (1854), “Turkey is a decaying nation;” and Cobden\r\non the same occasion said, “Turkey is a decaying country, and the Turks\r\ncannot be permanently maintained as a ruling Power in Europe.” The Czar\r\nhimself said that “a sick man is dying,” referring to Turkey, in his\r\nremarkable conversation with Sir Hamilton Seymour on January 28, 1853.\r\n\r\nWhen Turkey appeared at her last gasp she had been saved by England and\r\nFrance. Now, for the second time, the same Powers rescued her from\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\nEngland a short time previously had been in a feeble state owing to her\r\nsevere war with Napoleon the Great. This had exhausted her financially\r\nto a great extent.[54]\r\n\r\nHowever, Huskisson’s commercial policy (1823), Wellingtons Catholic\r\nEmancipation (1829), Russell’s great Reform Bill (1832), and the Repeal\r\nof the Corn Laws by Sir Robert Peel (1846), had exercised a refreshing\r\ninfluence upon her general prosperity.\r\n\r\nHere Lord Palmerston, a disciple[55] of Canning, appeared on the scene\r\nto play his part in “the European concert.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n                            THE CRIMEAN WAR.\r\n\r\n  _Nicholas I. alienates France from England by the Egyptian\r\n    question—Mehemet Ali and Palmerston’s convention against\r\n    him—Nicholas I. in England—The Protectorate of the Holy Land; breach\r\n    between Russia and France—Proposed partition of Turkey—War of Russia\r\n    and Turkey—The Vienna Note—Intervention of France and England to\r\n    save Turkey—Treaty of Paris; Russia foiled—Correspondence between\r\n    Palmerston and Aberdeen as to the declaration of war—National\r\n    feeling of England secures the former’s triumph—French motives in\r\n    joining in the war._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Turkey was unable to withstand Russia alone, yet, with the help\r\nof England and France, she was able to prevent the Russian inroad, on\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nNicholas, ever crafty, now turned his attention to fostering the minor\r\ndisputes which still existed between England and France.\r\n\r\nBeing envious of the English naval supremacy in the Mediterranean,\r\nFrance resumed her traditional policy of obtaining influence in Egypt,\r\nin order to be able to have a stronghold there against English power,\r\nand succeeded in making Egypt a faithful ally.\r\n\r\nEngland, on the other hand, clung to the alliance with Turkey, and\r\nassisted the Sultan in quelling the rebellion of Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\nThus we see there existed a difference between the two Powers,\r\nnotwithstanding that Russia was a common rival of both.\r\n\r\nNicholas used this difference as a tool to weaken the allies against his\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Mehemet Ali, with the silent approval of Russia, determined to\r\nbecome an independent monarch.\r\n\r\nThiers, a minister of Louis Phillipe, in helping Mehemet Ali, the\r\nviceroy of Egypt, had fallen into a Russian trap, although he believed\r\nand hoped that he was following the traditional policy of Napoleon the\r\nGreat. This proved, however, a mistaken policy; for it was the general\r\nEuropean feeling that if war resulted the Egyptians would be victorious,\r\nConstantinople would be in danger; the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi would\r\ncome into force, the Russians would rush to help the Porte, while the\r\nAnglo-French fleets would be barred from the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston saw that the united action of the five Great Powers\r\nmight settle the Eastern Question and destroy the influence of Russia,\r\nwhich seemed to be too arbitrarily strong. His idea was that a\r\nConference should be held by the five Great Powers, and this was\r\napproved of by all.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that the Conference was not as unanimous as could be\r\nwished, and certainly England did not agree with France on several\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nAt length Palmerston made a convention with three of the Powers for an\r\narmed interference in the Eastern Question. France was left alone. And\r\nPalmerston determined to pursue the above-mentioned policy.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Stopford captured Beyrout, and Sir Charles Napier bombarded\r\nAcre. The fall of the fortress of Acre—which was thought to be\r\nimpregnable—before the English fleet, terminated the war, and Mehemet\r\nAli became only an hereditary ruler over Egypt under the over-lord of\r\nthe Porte.\r\n\r\nThe breach between England and France having become serious, Russia\r\nhaving obtained her desires stationed her fleet at Sebastopol, where it\r\nremained quiescent during the English bombardment of Acre.\r\n\r\nThus, although Lord Palmerston succeeded in crushing the French\r\nMinister’s scheme, yet he fell into the snare laid for him by Russia,\r\nviz., of bringing about a diplomatic disagreement between England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBut Russia did not gain by the transaction, for she in her turn lost her\r\nsingle-handed power over Turkey, which was given into the hands of the\r\nFive Powers.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston offered the following condition to the Turkish\r\nGovernment. “England having, in conjunction with other Christian Powers,\r\nsucceeded in restoring Syria to the Sultan, she is entitled to expect\r\nthat the Sultan, in return for such assistance, should secure his\r\nChristian subjects from oppression.”[56]\r\n\r\nAt last the Syrian affairs were settled, but still England was always\r\ndreading a French attack both on Egypt and Syria.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the Emperor Nicholas paid his famous visit to England. What was\r\nhis object in coming to England at such a period? The only idea that I\r\ncan put forward is, that he wanted to see to what extent the\r\nAnglo-French disagreement[57] with regard to Syrian affairs had reached;\r\nalso to widen them as much as possible in order to make it impossible to\r\nform an Anglo-French alliance against him, and thus leave him a free\r\nhand in the settlement of the Eastern Question when the fall of Turkey\r\nshould take place.\r\n\r\nNicholas was at once informed, after his arrival, by the British Prime\r\nMinister, “that no foreign influence in Egypt would be allowed by the\r\nBritish Government, who desired to keep the way open to India.” He at\r\nonce perceived that the English were fearful of the French historic\r\nNapoleonic plans; and he at once used this fear to his advantage.\r\n\r\nHe first proposed a partition of Turkey, knowing that the English\r\nGovernment would not dare to agree to it, because it would hurt the\r\nnational feeling of England. Soon after the Anti-Napoleonic Revolution\r\nwas over the Holy Alliance was concluded between several European\r\nCourts, and the moral feelings in the western states of Europe were to\r\ndefend the weak against the strong, and to resist unjust aggression.\r\nThese feelings were clearly shown during the Russian oppression of\r\nPoland (1837), and in the Independence of Greece (1821–1829).\r\n\r\nIn England these feelings had manifested themselves, and any English\r\nGovernment which should venture to shock them would have been certainly\r\nupset. Therefore, a proposed partition of Turkey by Russia was received\r\nby the English Government with decided disfavour.\r\n\r\nThen the Czar proposed that the guardianship of the Holy Land should be\r\nentrusted to Russia. This was his great aim, and was his principal\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nEngland found herself in a dilemma. What was she to do? She had already\r\nrefused the Czar’s first proposal, and she felt obliged to accept the\r\nsecond. “The three representatives of the Conservative party, namely,\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and Lord Aberdeen, met the Czar\r\nand signed a secret memorandum, promising to exert their personal\r\ninfluence on behalf of the Greeks as opposed to the Latin Church at\r\nJerusalem, and so practically to forward Russian claims to the\r\nguardianship of the Holy Places, as opposed to those of France, who was\r\nto be ignored in the matter. This memorandum, to a certain extent\r\nfavouring Russia’s claim to a protectorate of the Greek Church, was\r\nnever placed in the Foreign Office archives, but was forwarded in\r\nsuccession from one English Foreign Secretary to another, until, as we\r\nshall show, poor Lord Aberdeen (Wellington and Peel being dead) was\r\ncalled on for his pound of flesh in 1853.”[58]\r\n\r\nThus Nicholas attained the end he had in view, and left England, well\r\npleased with the brilliant reception he had met with. “The Greek and the\r\nCatholic Church,” Lord Palmerston had written to Canning, 1849, “are\r\nmerely other names for Russian and French influence.”\r\n\r\nFrance at once perceived that the Czar’s visit to England was connected\r\nwith some secret arrangement to the prejudice of French interests, and\r\nfelt highly indignant.\r\n\r\nFrance did not lose any time, and commenced plans to overturn Russian\r\ninfluence in the Holy Land. Russia resented this, thinking that France\r\nwould be her only enemy. The Holy Land dispute soon became general.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish compromise did not please Russia and France. “Suddenly, the\r\nFrench ambassador at Constantinople, M. de Lavalette, was instructed to\r\ndemand that the grants[59] to the Latin Church should be strictly\r\nexecuted in the Holy Land.”[60]\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Lord Aberdeen was made the British Prime Minister, and “the\r\nEmperor Nicholas heard the tidings of Lord Aberdeen’s elevation to a\r\npremiership with a delight he did not suppress.”[61]\r\n\r\nNicholas thought that now an alliance between England and France was\r\nimpossible,[62] and at the same time, seeing that Prussia and Austria\r\nwere neutral, determined to obtain “the key of the Black Sea.”[63]\r\n\r\nHowever, he wanted to ascertain whether England would keep her secret\r\nengagement to come to a separate understanding with him. He again\r\nproposed a partition of Turkey, on January 28, 1853, at the same time\r\nmaking use of the curious expression to Sir Hamilton Seymour that “a\r\nsick man is dying,” and that his (the sick man’s) property should be\r\ndivided according to agreement between England and Russia. Nicholas’\r\nidea was (_a_) that Servia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, and the other\r\nprincipalities of the Danube, should become independent states under\r\nRussian protection, and (_b_) that he would “have no objection to\r\noffer,” to the occupation of Egypt and Candia by England “in the event\r\nof a distribution of the Ottoman Succession upon the fall of the\r\nEmpire,” (_c_) that Constantinople should never be held by the English\r\nor French, or any other great nation, and Greece should not strengthen\r\nherself “so as to become a powerful state,” and (_e_) that Russia should\r\noccupy Constantinople provisionally, not “as a proprietor, of course,\r\nbut as a trustee.”\r\n\r\n“In answer to these overtures,” Kinglake says, “the Government of the\r\nQueen disclaimed all notion of aiming at the possession of either\r\nConstantinople or any other of the Sultan’s possessions, and accepted\r\nthe assurances to the like effect which were given by the Czar. It\r\ncombated the opinion that the extinction of the Ottoman Empire was near\r\nat hand, and deprecated the discussions based on that supposition as\r\ntending directly to produce the very result against which they were\r\nmeant to provide.”[64]\r\n\r\nThen the Czar sent Prince Menschikoff to Constantinople, and entrusted\r\nto him the two following missions: viz., (_a_) to set forth a Russian\r\nclaim on the Holy Places, and (_b_) that all orthodox Christians, who\r\nwere subjects of Turkey, should be placed under the immediate\r\nprotectorate of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe above second mission was planned by Russia owing to her deep\r\nsympathy with the Sclavonic races, who had adhered to the same religion\r\nalthough they were still under Turkish rule. But this bond was rapidly\r\ngetting weaker, and the Christian inhabitants were determined to throw\r\noff, if possible, the Mahomedan yoke.\r\n\r\nBut the second demand of Russia, to my mind, was an unjust claim,\r\nbecause it would have considerably affected the independence or dignity\r\nof the Sultan.[65]\r\n\r\nThe English Ambassador in Turkey, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, a great\r\nopponent of Russia, advised the Porte to stand firm and resist to the\r\nutmost the second demand.[66] He and Lord Clarendon (the English Foreign\r\nSecretary), however, tried to persuade the Porte to agree to the first\r\ndemand, but the Porte, with decided firmness, declined to accept this\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nThis was followed, on May 21, 1853, by the departure of Prince\r\nMenschikoff from Constantinople, with the threat that “he had come in\r\nhis great coat, but would return in his uniform.” Russia then crossed\r\nthe Pruth on July 2nd, and occupied the Danubian Principalities as a\r\npreliminary to her demands. On the same day of the Russian invasion the\r\nrepresentatives of the Great Powers assembled at Vienna. This Congress\r\ndrew up what is known as the “Vienna Note.” Russia acceded to the terms\r\ncontained in the Note, but the Porte refused, and offered certain\r\namendments. The Powers after a time accepted them, and forwarded them to\r\nRussia, who, however, rejected them.[67] The Conference then dissolved.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1853, the Porte declared war on Russia; and the destruction\r\nof the Turkish fleet at Sinope sealed the Russian acquiescence to the\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nEngland and France allied themselves with Turkey against Russia, and\r\ndeclared war on March 28, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Sebastopol lasted for nearly a year, and its fall was\r\nfollowed by the Congress of Paris.[68] The plenipotentiaries of France,\r\nEngland, Russia, Turkey, Sardinia, Austria, and at last Prussia,\r\nassembled at Paris (February, 1856), and the “Treaty of Paris” was\r\nsigned, by which the following matters were settled:—\r\n\r\n1. The Great Powers “declare the Sublime Porte admitted to participate\r\nin the advantages of the public law and system (concert) of Europe.\r\nTheir Majesties engage, each on his part, to respect the independence\r\nand the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire; guarantee in common\r\nthe strict observance of that engagement; and will, in consequence,\r\nconsider any act tending to its violation, as a question of general\r\ninterest” (Art. VII.).\r\n\r\n2. “The Black Sea is neutralized; its waters and its ports thrown open\r\nto the mercantile marine of every nation, are formally and in perpetuity\r\ninterdicted to the flag of war, either of the Powers possessing its\r\ncoasts, or of any other Power” (Art. XI.), and, “The Black Sea being\r\nneutralized according to the terms of Article XI., the maintenance or\r\nestablishment upon its coast of military maritime arsenals becomes alike\r\nunnecessary and purposeless; in consequence, His Majesty the Emperor of\r\nall the Russias, and His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, engage not to\r\nestablish or to maintain upon that coast any military maritime arsenal”\r\n(Art. XIII.).\r\n\r\nThe docks and fortifications at Sebastopol were destroyed by the Western\r\nPowers; but it was allowed that Russia and the Porte should keep up “the\r\nnumber of light vessels necessary for the service of the coast” (Art.\r\nXIV.), and merchant ships of all kinds were allowed freely to enter it.\r\n\r\n3. All control over the mouth of the Danube was taken from Russia and\r\nentrusted to the authority of the Riverain Commission (Art. XVII.). “A\r\nCommission shall be established, and shall be composed of delegates of\r\nAustria, Bavaria, the Sublime Porte, and Würtemburg (one for each of\r\nthose Powers), to whom shall be added commissioners from the three\r\nDanubian Principalities, whose nomination shall have been approved by\r\nthe Porte. This Commission, which shall be permanent: (1) Shall prepare\r\nregulations of navigation and river police; (2) Shall remove the\r\nimpediments, of whatever nature they may be, which still prevent the\r\napplication to the Danube of the arrangements of the Treaty of Vienna;\r\n(3) Shall order and cause to be executed the necessary works throughout\r\nthe whole course of the river; (4) Shall, after the dissolution of the\r\nEuropean Commission, see to maintaining the mouths of the Danube and the\r\nneighbouring parts of the sea in a navigable state” (Art. XVII.).\r\n\r\n4. A portion of Bessarabia on the left bank of the Danube was ceded by\r\nRussia in order to make the Turkish defence against Russia more easy,\r\nand more fully to secure the freedom of the navigation of the Danube\r\n(Art. XX.).\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt Russia was beaten by the combined alliance against\r\nher. She had entirely overreached herself and miscalculated the temper\r\nof the other Powers. She had thought that an Anglo-French alliance was\r\nimpossible, and that Prussia and Austria would have remained neutral.\r\nPrussia indeed did maintain a neutrality at the commencement of the war,\r\nand the King of Prussia himself said, “I am resolved to maintain a\r\nposition of complete neutrality, and to this I add with proud elevation\r\nthat my people and myself are of one mind. They require absolute\r\nneutrality from me.”\r\n\r\nAustria, however, only maintained a conditional neutrality. The Austrian\r\nEmperor, in replying to the Russian Ambassador, Count Orloff, said,\r\n“Then must Austria be equally free to act as her interest and dignity\r\nmay direct,” if Russia was to cross the Danube, or seek to occupy fresh\r\nterritory, or not evacuate the Principalities when the war was over.\r\n\r\nLater on both Prussia and Austria formed a defensive alliance against\r\nRussia, and with the consent of the Porte, the Principalities were\r\nprovisionally occupied by Austria.\r\n\r\nIn England Lord Aberdeen did his utmost to bring about a peace between\r\nRussia and Turkey, but it was a hopeless task. Lord Palmerston, on the\r\nother hand, described the aggressive policy of Russia as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The policy and practice of the Russian Government has always been to\r\npush forward its encroachments as fast and as far as the apathy or want\r\nof firmness of other Governments would allow it to go, but always to\r\nstop and retire when it was met with decided resistance, and then to\r\nwait for the next favourable opportunity to make another spring on its\r\nintended victim. In furtherance of this policy, the Russian Government\r\nhas always had two strings to its bow—moderate language and\r\ndisinterested professions at Petersburg and at London; active aggression\r\nby its agents on the scene of operations. If the aggressions succeed\r\nlocally, the St. Petersburg Government adopts them as a _fait accompli_\r\nwhich it did not intend, but cannot, in honour, recede from. If the\r\nlocal agents fail, they are disavowed and recalled, and the language\r\npreviously held is appealed to as a proof that the agents have\r\noverstepped their instructions. This was exemplified, in the treaty of\r\nUnkiar-Skelessi, and in the exploits of Simonivitch and Vikovitch in\r\nPersia.”[69] And Lord Palmerston wrote as follows to Lord Aberdeen (July\r\n4, 1853), when the combined fleets of England and France were at Besika\r\nBay:—“In the meantime, however, I hope you will allow the squadrons to\r\nbe ordered to go up to the Bosphorus as soon as it is known at\r\nConstantinople that the Russians have entered the Principalities, and to\r\nbe further at liberty to go into the Black Sea, if necessary or useful\r\nfor the protection of Turkish territory. The advantages of such a course\r\nseem to be—\r\n\r\n“First. That it would encourage and assist the Turks in those defensive\r\narrangements and organizations which the present crisis may give the\r\nTurkish Government facilities for making, and the benefit of which, in\r\nstrengthening Turkey against attack, will continue after the crisis is\r\nover.\r\n\r\n“Secondly. It would essentially tend to prevent any further inroad on\r\nTurkish territory in Europe or in Asia, and it is manifest that any such\r\nfurther inroad would much increase the difficulties of a settlement.\r\n\r\n“Thirdly. It would act as a wholesome check upon the Emperor and his\r\nadvisers, and would stimulate Austria and Prussia to increased exertions\r\nto bring the Russian Government to reason.\r\n\r\n“Fourthly. It would relieve England and France from the disagreeable,\r\nand not very creditable, position of waiting without venturing to enter\r\nthe back door as friends, while the Russians have taken forcible\r\npossession of the front hall as enemies.\r\n\r\n“If these orders are to be given, I would suggest that it is very\r\nimportant that they should be given without delay, so that we may be\r\nable, when these matters are discussed this week in Parliament, to say\r\nthat such orders have been sent off. Of course they would at the same\r\ntime be communicated to the Russian Government.”\r\n\r\nBut the Premier did not agree with Palmerston’s views.\r\n\r\nThe combined fleets, at the request of the Sultan, passed up to\r\nConstantinople (October 7, 1853). Palmerston then made two propositions\r\nto the Cabinet:—\r\n\r\n“First. That instructions should be sent to Constantinople that, in the\r\nevent of war having been declared, the two squadrons should enter the\r\nBlack Sea, and should send word to the Russian admiral at Sebastopol\r\nthat, in the existing state of things, any Russian ship of war found\r\ncruising in the Black Sea would be detained, and be given over to the\r\nTurkish Government.\r\n\r\n“Secondly. That England and France should propose to the Sultan to\r\nconclude a convention to the effect that, whereas war has unfortunately\r\nbroken out between Russia and Turkey, in consequence of differences\r\ncreated by unjust demands made upon Turkey by Russia, and by\r\nunwarrantable invasion of the Turkish territory by a Russian army; and\r\nwhereas it is deemed by England and France to be an object of general\r\nEuropean interest, and of special importance to them that the political\r\nindependence and the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire should\r\nbe maintained inviolate against Russian aggression, the two Powers\r\nengage to furnish to the Sultan such naval assistance as may be\r\nnecessary in existing circumstances for the defence of his empire; and\r\nthey moreover engage to permit any of their respective subjects who may\r\nbe willing to do so, to enter the military or naval service of the\r\nSultan. In return, the Sultan is to engage that he will consult with\r\nEngland and France as to the terms and conditions of the new treaty\r\nwhich is to determine, on the conclusion of hostilities, the future\r\nrelations of Russia and Turkey.”\r\n\r\nBut Lord Aberdeen in reply said:—\r\n\r\n“I cannot say that I think the present state of the Russo-Turkish\r\nquestion would authorize such a proceeding on our part as that which you\r\nintend to propose.”\r\n\r\nOn November 1, 1853, Palmerston again said in concluding another letter\r\nto Lord Aberdeen:—\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, then, that our course is plain, simple, and straight.\r\nThat we must help Turkey out of her difficulties by negotiation, if\r\npossible; and that if negotiation fails, we must, by force of arms,\r\ncarry her safely through her dangers.”\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the Turkish fleet at Sinope, Palmerston wrote\r\nto Aberdeen as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Will you allow me this opportunity of repeating in writing what I have\r\nmore than once said verbally, on the state of things between Russia and\r\nTurkey? It appears to me that we have two objects in view: the one to\r\nput an end to the present war between these two Powers; the other to\r\nprevent, as far as diplomatic arrangements can do so, a recurrence of\r\nsimilar differences, and renewed dangers to the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\n“Now it seems to me that, unless Turkey shall be laid prostrate at the\r\nfeet of Russia by the disasters of the war—an event which England and\r\nFrance could not without dishonour permit—no peace can be concluded\r\nbetween the contending parties unless the Emperor consents to evacuate\r\nthe Principalities, to abandon his demands, and to renounce some of the\r\nembarrassing stipulations of former treaties upon which he has founded\r\nthe pretensions which have been the cause of existing difficulties.\r\n\r\n“To bring the Emperor to agree to this, it is necessary to exert a\r\nconsiderable pressure upon him; and the quarter in which that pressure\r\ncan at present be most easily brought to bear is the Black Sea and the\r\ncountries bordering upon it. In the Black Sea, the combined English,\r\nFrench, and Turkish squadrons are indisputably superior to the Russian\r\nfleet, and are able to give the law to that fleet. What I would strongly\r\nrecommend, therefore, is that which I proposed some months ago to the\r\nCabinet, namely, that the Russian Government and the Russian admiral at\r\nSebastopol should be informed that so long as Russian troops occupy the\r\nPrincipalities, or hold a position in any other part of the Turkish\r\nterritory, no Russian ships of war can be allowed to show themselves out\r\nof port in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n“You will say that this would be an active hostility towards Russia; but\r\nso is the declaration already made, that no Russian ships shall be\r\npermitted to make any landing or attack on any part of the Turkish\r\nterritory. The only difference between the two declarations is that the\r\none already made is incomplete and insufficient for its purpose, and\r\nthat the one which I propose would be complete and sufficient. If the\r\nRussian fleet were shut up in Sebastopol, it is probable that the Turks\r\nwould be able to make in Asia an impression that would tend to\r\nfacilitate the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the conditions of peace, it seems to me that the only\r\narrangement which could afford to Europe a fair security against future\r\ndangers arising out of the encroachments of Russia on Turkey, and the\r\nattempts of the Russian Government to interfere in the internal affairs\r\nof the Turkish Empire, would be that arrangement which I have often\r\nsuggested, namely, that the treaty to be concluded between Russia and\r\nTurkey should be an ordinary treaty of peace and friendship, of\r\nboundaries, commerce, and mutual protection of the subjects of the one\r\nparty within the territories of the other; and that all the stipulations\r\nwhich might be required for the privileges of the Principalities and of\r\nServia, and for the protection of the Christian religion and its\r\nchurches and the Ottoman dominions by the Sultan and the five Powers. By\r\nsuch a treaty, Russia would be prevented from dealing single-handed with\r\nTurkey in regard to those matters on which she has, from time to time,\r\nendeavoured to fasten a quarrel on the Sultan.”\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen’s reply was:—\r\n\r\n“I confess I am not prepared to adopt the mode which you think most\r\nlikely to restore peace.”\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston tendered his resignation on receiving this reply, but\r\nwithdrew it ten days after when the Cabinet adopted his views.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1854, Lord Palmerston wrote to the Duke of Newcastle, then\r\nMinister of War—“Our only chance of bringing Russia to terms is by\r\n_offensive_ and not by defensive operations. We and the French ought to\r\ngo to the Crimea and take Sebastopol. If this blow were accompanied by\r\nsuccessful operations in Georgia and Circassia, we might have a Merry\r\nChristmas and a Happy New Year.”\r\n\r\nThus we see that the English policy during the Crimean crisis changed\r\nfrom peace tactics to defensive operations, and was subsequently turned\r\ninto an offensive line of action which terminated in a brilliant triumph\r\nfor England.\r\n\r\nBut how was Lord Palmerston able to carry out his war policy so\r\nvigorously? The answer is a very simple one. He was backed and urged on\r\nby the nation at large, who were incensed at the insolence of Russia.\r\nThus he was able to pursue his plans, being encouraged and supported by\r\na people who were well able to carry out what they resolved upon.\r\n\r\nKinglake said he (Lord Palmerston) “was gifted with the instinct which\r\nenables a man to read the heart of a nation.”\r\n\r\nHis judgment was rightly pronounced, for Palmerston saw the feelings of\r\nhis national constituents and steered his course well and skilfully.[70]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the national feeling of England at that time?\r\n\r\n“In the present instance,” said the Prince Consort, “their (the English)\r\nfeeling is something of this sort: The Emperor of Russia is a tyrant,\r\nthe enemy of all liberty on the Continent, and the oppressor of Poland.”\r\nFrom these royal remarks, I do not think I shall be far wrong in saying\r\nthat the growing tendency of the English people towards liberalism since\r\nthe Reform Bill of 1832, and the teaching of William Wilberforce, had\r\nled them to consider Russia not only as a national enemy but as a\r\ngeneral opponent of the rights of humanity and civilization. No wonder\r\nthat a war became a necessity after this public manifestation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last chapter I stated that England had rapidly\r\nincreased, in wealth and prosperity since the Repeal of the Corn Laws.\r\nGladstone, in the House of Commons, stated that such was the vigour and\r\nelasticity of the English trade, that even after the disadvantage of a\r\nbad harvest, and under the pressure of war, the imports from day to day,\r\nand almost from hour to hour, were increasing, and that the very last\r\npapers laid on the table showed within the last three months of the year\r\nthat there was an increase of £250,000 in the national exports.[71]\r\nThis, then, was one of the reasons which enabled England to carry on\r\nthis war so successfully.\r\n\r\nLet us turn our attention for a short time to France, which at this\r\nperiod was undergoing considerable internal agitation. Republicanism was\r\nnow abolished and Monarchy reigned in its stead in the hands of Napoleon\r\nIII. (1852). There seemed every prospect of the French Monarchy being\r\nfirmly re-established.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor was very desirous of starting a European War for the\r\npurpose of securing his seat on the throne, and also for the\r\naggrandizement of his country abroad.[72] The interests of his country,\r\nboth religious and political, were opposed to those of Russia with\r\nregard to the Holy Places, while both England and France had a common\r\ninterest in keeping the Ottoman Empire from Russia. This latter interest\r\nacted as a means of union between the two Powers, both of whom were\r\nready at any moment to attack Russia, and the publication of the Czar’s\r\nmemorable conversation with Sir H. Seymour still further cemented that\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThe result we have already seen. Russia was humiliated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n                       THE BLACK SEA CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\n  _French influence destroyed by the Franco-Prussian War—Russia annuls\r\n    the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris—Condition of Europe\r\n    prevents their enforcement by the Powers—London Conference; Russia\r\n    secures the Black Sea; England’s mistake—Alsace and Lorraine destroy\r\n    the balance of power._\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia had convinced herself that the separation of England from France\r\nwas not a sufficient guarantee to hinder the possibility of the alliance\r\nof the two Powers against her, because a common interest would unite\r\nthem immediately. Russia now determined to crush down one of the two\r\nPowers, independently of the other, and was only waiting for an\r\nopportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Franco-Prussian War broke out through the question of the\r\nSpanish Succession. England maintained a strict neutrality, and this now\r\nseemed a glorious opportunity for Russia to carry out her long-cherished\r\ndesigns. She supported Prussia _morally_, in this way hoping to crush\r\nFrance, and then only England would be left to attack. The result proved\r\nfavourable; France was defeated by Prussia, and this was followed by the\r\nfall of the Monarchy, and the proclamation of the Republic (September\r\n14, 1870).\r\n\r\nRussia now looked around, and at a glance saw the favourable position\r\nshe occupied, and her strength. Austria had been weakened by the war\r\nwith Prussia in 1866, Spain and Italy were convulsed with revolutions,\r\nTurkey was naturally weak; Prussia had suffered somewhat in 1866 with\r\nAustria, and with France in 1870. France herself had undoubtedly\r\nreceived a crushing blow, while England was worried over the Alabama\r\nclaims with America.\r\n\r\nThus we see the balance of power was considerably shaken by the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, while an alliance among the Western states seemed\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Western Europe was startled by Prince Gortchakoff’s declaration\r\nthat the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris, 1856, were null and\r\nvoid. “He declared it would no longer be submitted to by his Imperial\r\nmaster.”[73]\r\n\r\nEngland naturally felt very indignant, but was practically helpless, as\r\nshe was unable to get any ally from among the Western Powers, and she\r\nfelt unable to cope singly with Russia. The Government were perplexed,\r\nand the Premier, Mr. W. E. Gladstone, sent Lord Odo Russell to the\r\nGerman Chancellor to ask his advice on the subject, and to inform him\r\nthat “the question was of such a nature that England, with or without\r\nallies, would have to go to war with Russia.”\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck, who was afraid of a Franco-Russian alliance, and wished\r\nto conciliate the Russian Emperor, recommended that a conference should\r\nbe held in St. Petersburg. The English Government objected to this, so a\r\nConference was held in London where the following provisions were agreed\r\nto:—\r\n\r\n“Article I. Articles XI., XIII., and XIV., of the Treaty of Paris, 1856,\r\nare abrogated.\r\n\r\n“Article II. The principle of the closing of the Straits of the\r\nDardanelles and the Bosphorus is maintained, with power to his Imperial\r\nMajesty the Sultan to open the said Straits in time of peace to the\r\nvessels of war of friendly and allied Powers, in case the Sublime Porte\r\nshould judge it necessary in order to secure the execution of the\r\nstipulations of the Treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\n“Article III. The Black Sea remains, as heretofore, open to the\r\nmercantile marine of all nations.\r\n\r\n“Article IV. The Commission managing the navigation of the Danube “is\r\nmaintained in its present composition” for a further period of twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n“Article VIII. The high contracting parties renew and confirm all the\r\nstipulations of 1856, which are not annulled or modified by the present\r\ntreaty.”\r\n\r\nThis treaty resulted in what Russia wished, viz., the opening of the\r\nBlack Sea to Russian war ships—a right which she had held previous to\r\nthe Crimean War.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli (afterwards Lord Beaconsfield) vigorously attacked the\r\nGladstonian policy by saying that “the neutral character of the Black\r\nSea is the essence of the Treaty of Paris, and that that, in fact, was\r\nthe question for which we had struggled and made great sacrifice and\r\nendured these sufferings which never can be forgotten,” and the “point\r\nupon which the negotiations for peace (at Vienna, 1855) was broken off\r\nwas the neutral character of the Black Sea.”[74]\r\n\r\nIn answer to this attack Mr. Gladstone replied, “I do not speak from\r\ndirect communication with Lord Clarendon, but I have been told since his\r\ndeath that he never attached a value to that neutralization. Again I do\r\nnot speak from direct communication, but I have been told that Lord\r\nPalmerston always looked upon the neutralization as an arrangement which\r\nmight be maintained and held together for a limited number of years, but\r\nwhich, from its character, it was impossible to maintain as a permanent\r\ncondition for a great settlement of Europe.”\r\n\r\nHowever, Russia had regained what she had lost at the close of the\r\nCrimean War by skilful diplomacy. She now was perfectly at liberty to\r\nkeep her fleet in the Black Sea, and to refortify Sebastopol and Keotch\r\nto such an extent as to render them impregnable.\r\n\r\nShe felt gratified at the result of the Franco-Prussian War, and on\r\nhearing that Prussia had annexed Alsace and Lorraine. General Ignatieff,\r\nthe Russian Ambassador at Constantinople, hastened to the German\r\nAmbassador, Count Karserling, and said, “Permit me to congratulate you,\r\nand _thank you_; for you it is a prodigious mistake, but on Russia you\r\nhave conferred the greatest possible boon.” At the time of the\r\nannexation of the two French provinces, Germany thought that they would\r\nprove of the greatest value to the German Empire, but this idea proved a\r\nmistake, and since then Russia has used, and still uses them, as a pivot\r\non which the Eastern Question turns.\r\n\r\nFrederick III.’s idea of selling back Alsace and Lorraine would no doubt\r\nprove a great benefit, not only to the German nation, but also to the\r\nmaintenance of the balance of power in Europe.\r\n\r\nYet, though Bismarck defeated Napoleon III. in a sanguinary war, Prince\r\nGortschakoff had beaten all the signitary powers at the Treaty of Paris\r\nby one stroke of the pen, and the greatest gainer, in the\r\nFranco-Prussian War was not Germany but Russia. Verily, indeed, is it\r\nonce more proved that the Pen is mightier than the Sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n                     THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR OF 1878.\r\n\r\n  _Bulgarian atrocities—The Andrassy Note; England destroys its\r\n    effect—The Berlin Memorandum; England opposes it—Russia prepares for\r\n    a Turkish war—Conference of Constantinople—New Turkish\r\n    Constitution—Russo-Turkish War—Treaty of San Stefano—Intervention of\r\n    the Powers—The Berlin Congress—Final treaty of peace._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Slavs migrated to the Balkan Peninsula as early as 450 A.D., and\r\nBosnia remained the only Slavonic part of the Turkish Empire where a\r\nnative nobility owned the land and a peasantry tilled it for them.\r\n\r\nHaving been defeated by the Turks, the nobility became Mahommedans to\r\nsave their patrimony, while the peasantry, having nothing to lose,\r\nremained Christians; but the tyranny of their nobility at length obliged\r\nthe Turks to put an end to the Feudal System in Bosnia (1850–1851).\r\n\r\nIn August, 1875, Herzegovina (the southwestern district of Bosnia)\r\nrevolted against the Sultan, being aided by a strong natural position\r\nand receiving the assistance of both Servia and Montenegro.\r\n\r\nWhile this revolt was going on the Bulgarians also rose in rebellion\r\nagainst the Sultan (1876), but were put down by the Turkish Government,\r\nalthough not without shameful cruelties and outrages being committed by\r\nthe Turkish troops and militia, which caused great indignation\r\nthroughout Europe,[75] and specially so in Russia. This, therefore, gave\r\nthe latter country a good opportunity of claiming to be a general\r\nprotector of the Christians in Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Minister, Count Andrassy, on behalf of Austria,\r\nGermany, and Russia, drew up a Note in which five[76] chief concessions\r\nwere insisted upon from the Porte as necessary for the pacification of\r\nthe revolted provinces.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, on behalf of the English Government, signed[77] it, but\r\nadded that the integrity[78] of the Ottoman Empire was to be respected.\r\nHere the Czar caught a key-note of the English policy, and he played on\r\nit afterwards to his own advantage.\r\n\r\nThe Porte accepted the conditions of the Note, but the rebels did not\r\ntrust the Turkish promises, so the insurrections continued.\r\n\r\nThe Czar then, with Gortschakoff, met Bismarck and Andrassy at Berlin,\r\nand, together, they drew up the “Berlin Memorandum,”[79] in which the\r\nthree Powers asked the Sultan to grant an armistice for two months in\r\norder that the demands of the insurgents might receive a fair\r\nconsideration. Italy and France added their voices, but England\r\nrefused[80] to sign the Memorandum and sent a powerful squadron to\r\nBesika Bay, expecting that the Sultan would refuse the Memorandum\r\nbecause it would endanger the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. This\r\n“Berlin Memorandum” displays the skilful way in which Russia, under the\r\nclever guidance of the Czar and his Minister Gortschakoff, carried on\r\nnegotiation. She was only seeking a _pretence_[81] for a single-handed\r\nwar policy with Turkey, and in order to do this she proposed measures at\r\nBerlin which she knew would prove objectionable to England. Germany, who\r\ndreaded a special alliance between France and Russia, was obliged to\r\nagree to these measures, thus becoming a tool of Russia, who wanted to\r\nmake England first deviate from the Treaties of Paris and London, and,\r\nif possible, to break down the balance of power in Europe which she\r\nherself had already done by her withdrawal from the Black Sea clauses in\r\nthe Treaty of Paris. England fell into the snare together with the other\r\nPowers. She objected to the Berlin Memorandum, refused to sign, and sent\r\na fleet to Besika Bay in support of her objection. This was just what\r\nRussia desired.\r\n\r\nA new Sultan now ascended the throne, and Russian influence declined\r\nwhile that of England increased.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1876, Prince Milan of Servia, and Prince Mikita of Montenegro,\r\ndeclared war against Turkey, having open assistance from Russia. The\r\nrebels, however, were subjugated by the Turks.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1876, Alexander II. of Russia, made a public declaration\r\nthat “if Turkey did not give due guarantees for the better government of\r\nher Christian subjects he would force them to do so, either in concert\r\nwith his allies or by independent action.”\r\n\r\nThe European Powers, in consequence of this proclamation, proposed a\r\nConference at Constantinople to settle the matter. The Czar, seeing that\r\nthe Conference was inevitable, agreed to it. The representatives met,\r\nand, as was to be expected, asked nearly the same conditions as had been\r\ncontained in the “Andrassy Note.”\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of a new Constitution for the Ottoman Empire was the\r\nresult of the Conference, much to the disappointment of Russia, who did\r\nnot expect that any such result would be arrived at. Thus, in order to\r\nstop any further reforms or concessions being made by Turkey, she\r\nsucceeded in removing from power the author of the new Constitution,\r\nviz., Midhat Pasha, who was an important personage in Turkish politics.\r\n\r\nThe following little story shows the skilful way in which the Turkish\r\nMinister was removed from power by the agency of Russia:—\r\n\r\n“During the Conference, the day after the Turks had proclaimed their new\r\nConstitution, General Ignatieff met Sir W. White.\r\n\r\n“‘Have you read the Constitution?’ asked Ignatieff. ‘No,’ said the\r\nEnglishman; ‘what does it matter? It is not serious.’ ‘But,’ said\r\nIgnatieff, ‘you must really read one Article;’ and so saying he pointed\r\nout the Article which set forth that all provisions to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding the Sultan was to retain an absolute right to banish\r\nfrom the capital any person whose presence might seem objectionable to\r\nhim. ‘Mark my words,’ said Ignatieff, ‘the first man to be exiled under\r\nthat clause will be Midhat Pasha, the author of the Constitution.’\r\n\r\n“The prediction was fulfilled to the letter. Meeting Ignatieff some time\r\nafter, Sir W. White recalled the prophecy and its fulfilment. ‘Oh! yes,’\r\nsaid the general, carelessly; ‘I arranged that.’ ‘But you had left\r\nConstantinople before Midhat’s exile.’ ‘Certainly, but I arranged it\r\njust before I left.’ ‘How?’ ‘It was very simple; the weather was stormy\r\nin the Black Sea, and I could not leave for some days after the\r\ndeparture of my colleague. I went on board my steamer and anchored\r\nexactly opposite the Sultan’s palace. I did not go and bid him farewell,\r\nbut waited. In a day or two, as I anticipated, there came an\r\n_aide-de-camp_ from the Sultan to express his regret and surprise that\r\nI, whom he had known better than any of the Ambassadors, should be\r\ndeparting without paying him a farewell visit. I replied that, of\r\ncourse, I should have been delighted to have paid my respects to His\r\nMajesty, but that it was no longer necessary. I had paid my farewell\r\nvisit to Midhat Pasha, as, under the Constitution, it was to him, not\r\nthe Sultan, that such an act of respect was due. Almost immediately\r\nafter arriving in Russia I heard of the exile of Midhat. My parting shot\r\nhad secured his downfall.’”[82]\r\n\r\nThe Conference failed, and Russia declared war against Turkey, for now\r\nshe had obtained what she had been striving for during the diplomatic\r\ntransactions, viz., a pretence for a single-handed policy with regard to\r\nTurkey, and, secondly, she had obtained sufficient time for making all\r\nnecessary war preparations. Now, although she had already got back what\r\nshe had lost in the Crimean War (through the Franco-Prussian War), yet\r\nshe was determined to obtain what she had intended to take at the\r\nCrimean War, viz., Constantinople.\r\n\r\nA large Russian army crossed the Pruth (April, 1877), and encamped\r\nbefore Constantinople. In Asia Kars was captured. This led to the Treaty\r\nof San Stefano.\r\n\r\nBy this treaty the Ottoman Empire in Europe was completely abrogated. It\r\nrecognized the independence of Servia, Montenegro, and Roumania;\r\nBulgaria was created, and its boundaries now extended to the Black and\r\nÆgean Seas, embracing several valuable harbours. Although the latter\r\ncountry still remained tributary to Turkey, yet Russia had the\r\nappointment of a Christian prince in her hands. It has now to have a\r\nseparate administration, to be supervised by Russian commissioners, and\r\nwas also to be garrisoned by Russian troops.\r\n\r\nIn Bosnia, Crete, Thessaly, and Epirus a certain amount of reform was to\r\nbe introduced by the Porte under the supervision of Russia. It was also\r\nenacted that the part of Bessarabia taken from Russia in 1856 should be\r\nceded back to her, to which Lord Palmerston attached great value,\r\n“because,” he said, “it is not of local, but of European interest.”\r\nKars, Batoum, and other adjoining districts in Asia were added to\r\nRussia, by which cession she undoubtedly held the strongholds of\r\nArmenia. Turkey had to pay Russia three hundred million roubles.\r\n\r\nThe results of this treaty may be described as follows: It was nothing\r\nless than (1) “To take all the European dominions of the Ottoman Empire\r\nfrom the Porte and put them under the administration of Russia;” (2) “to\r\nmake the Black Sea as much a Russian lake as the Caspian;” (3) to give\r\nRussia a firm hold of the Mediterranean, and thereby imperil the naval\r\nsupremacy of England in that quarter.\r\n\r\nNaturally, England could not accept the Treaty of San Stefano without\r\nsome alterations. Lord Derby resigned on the refusal of his demand that\r\nthe treaty should be laid before Parliament, and Lord Salisbury sent out\r\na vigorous circular which showed the injustice towards other races of a\r\nlarge Bulgaria establishing Slav supremacy in the Balkan Peninsula under\r\nRussian influence; also the loss of the ports of Bourgas and Batoum by\r\nthe Turks would give Russia command of the Black Sea trade, while the\r\ncession of Kars to her would also influence Turkey’s Asiatic\r\npossessions. This would also affect the English interests in the Persian\r\nGulf, the Levant, and the Suez Canal, which were in the Ottoman keeping,\r\nand therefore was a matter of extreme solicitude for England. She would\r\nbe willing, however, to join in general stipulations made by the joint\r\nPowers, but would not submit to Prince Gortschakoffs commands. Again, an\r\nunpaid pecuniary debt owing to Russia by Turkey would give the former\r\ndangerous power.\r\n\r\nThe following words occur in the first despatch of the English\r\nGovernment to Russia:—\r\n\r\n“The course on which the Russian Government has entered involves graver\r\nand more serious consideration. It is in contravention of the\r\nstipulation of the Treaty of Paris (March 30, 1856), by which Russia and\r\nthe other signatory Powers engaged, each on its own part, to respect the\r\nindependence and the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire. At the\r\nclose of the Conference of London of 1871, the above plenipotentiary, in\r\ncommon with those of the other Powers, signed a declaration affirming it\r\nto be an essential principle of the law of nations that no Power can\r\nliberate itself from the engagement of a treaty, nor modify the\r\nstipulations thereof, unless with the consent of the contracting parties\r\nby means of an amicable arrangement. In taking action against Turkey on\r\nhis own part, and having recourse to arms without further consultation\r\nwith his allies, the Emperor of Russia has separated himself from the\r\nEuropean concert hitherto maintained, and has at the same time departed\r\nfrom the rule to which he himself had solemnly recorded his\r\nconsent.”[83]\r\n\r\nThe English Government addressed a second despatch to Russia, stating\r\nthat the English Government is “of opinion that any treaty concluded by\r\nthe Governments of Russia and the Porte affecting the treaties of 1856\r\nand 1871 must be a European treaty, and would not be valid without the\r\nassent of the Powers who were parties to those treaties.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian Minister’s (Gortschakoff’s) reply was received at last: “We\r\nrepeat the assurance that we do not intend to settle by ourselves\r\nEuropean questions having reference to the peace which is to be made.”\r\n\r\nThen the English Government sent another despatch to Russia and the\r\nother foreign Courts, and it was communicated through an English\r\nAmbassador at St. Petersburg that the Russian Emperor “stated\r\ncategorically that questions bearing on European interests will be\r\nconcerted with European Powers, and he had given Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment clear and positive assurance to this effect.”\r\n\r\nAt length Austria, with the full appreciation of Russia, invited England\r\nto a Conference at Berlin for the object of establishing “an European\r\nagreement as to the modifications which it might become necessary to\r\nintroduce in existing treaties in order to make them harmonize with the\r\npresent situation.”\r\n\r\nThe English Government, however, stipulated beforehand “that it would be\r\ndesirable to have it understood in the first place that all questions\r\ndealt with in the San Stefano Treaty between Russia and Turkey” should\r\nbe fully considered in the Congress, and “that no alteration in the\r\ncondition of things previously established by treaty should be\r\nacknowledged as valid until it has received the consent of the Powers.”\r\n\r\nRussia replied that “the preliminary treaty of peace between Russia and\r\nTurkey will be textually committed to the Great Powers before the\r\nmeeting of the Congress, and that in the Congress itself each Power will\r\nhave full liberty of assent and of its free action” (“_la pleine liberté\r\nde ses appréciations et de son action_”).\r\n\r\nThis was a diplomatic triumph for England, and the treaty was formally\r\nsubmitted to the Congress. But there were certain facts which must not\r\nescape our notice, for just before the publication of the Treaty of San\r\nStefano the excitement in England had attained its zenith. Russia,\r\nperceiving this, and hearing that England was quite ready to take up\r\narms against her, took the utmost precautions not to injure English\r\ninterests; so a Russian occupation of Constantinople, or any other\r\ncircumstance which might excite the enmity of England, were omitted in\r\nthe San Stefano Treaty.\r\n\r\nWhen this became known in England the excitement abated somewhat; and,\r\nseeing this, Russia consented to submit the treaty to the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was opened at Berlin, under the presidency of the German\r\nChancellor, Bismarck; and Beaconsfield firmly stood his ground at the\r\nCongress, previously calling out the reserve forces and summoning seven\r\nthousand Indian troops to Malta. Austria began to arm. Russia now could\r\nnot be obstinate.\r\n\r\nThe following conditions were fixed and drawn up by the Congress:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Bulgaria._\r\n\r\nArticle I. Bulgaria is constituted an autonomous and tributary\r\nprincipality under the suzerainty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan; it\r\nwill have a Christian Government and a national militia.\r\n\r\nArticle III. The Prince of Bulgaria shall be freely elected by the\r\npopulation and confirmed by the Sublime Porte, with the assent of the\r\nPowers. No member of the reigning dynasties of the Great European Powers\r\nmay be elected Prince of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nIn case of a vacancy in the princely dignity, the election of the new\r\nprince shall take place under the same conditions and with the same\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Eastern Roumelia._\r\n\r\nArticle XIII. A province is formed south of the Balkans which will take\r\nthe name of “Eastern Roumelia,” and will remain under the direct\r\npolitical and military authority of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan,\r\nunder conditions of administrative autonomy. It shall have a Christian\r\nGovernor-general.\r\n\r\nArticle XVII. The Governor-general of Eastern Roumelia shall be\r\nnominated by the Sublime Porte, with the assent of the Powers, for a\r\nterm of five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Crete, &c._\r\n\r\nArticle XXIII. The Sublime Porte undertakes to scrupulously apply to the\r\nisland of Crete the Organic Law of 1868, with such modifications as may\r\nbe considered equitable.\r\n\r\nSimilar laws adapted to local requirements, excepting as regards the\r\nexemption from taxation granted to Crete, shall also be introduced into\r\nthe other parts of Turkey in Europe for which no special organization\r\nhas been provided by the present treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Bosnia and Herzegovina._\r\n\r\nArticle XXV. The provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be occupied\r\nand administered by Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania._\r\n\r\nArticle XXVI. The independence of Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania is\r\nrecognized by the Sublime Porte, and by all the high contracting\r\nparties, subject to the conditions set forth in the following:—\r\n\r\nIn Montenegro the difference of religious creeds and confessions shall\r\nnot be alleged against any person as a ground for exclusion or\r\nincapacity in matters relating to the enjoyment of civil and political\r\nrights, admission to public employments, functions, and honours, or the\r\nexercise of the various professions and industries in any locality\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe freedom and outward exercise of all forms of worship shall be\r\nassured to all persons belonging to Montenegro, as well as to\r\nforeigners; and no hindrance shall be offered either to the hierarchical\r\norganization of the different communions or to their relations with\r\ntheir spiritual chiefs.\r\n\r\nArticle XLV. The principality of Roumania restores to His Majesty the\r\nEmperor of Russia that portion of Bessarabian territory detached from\r\nRussia by the Treaty of Paris of 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Cessions in Asia._\r\n\r\nArticle LVIII. The Sublime Porte cedes to the Russian Empire in Asia the\r\nterritories of Ardahan, Kars, and Batoum, together with the latter port.\r\n\r\nArticle XIX. His Majesty the Emperor declares that it is his intention\r\nto constitute Batoum a free port, essentially commercial.\r\n\r\nArticle LX. The valley of Alaxhkerd and the town of Bayazid, ceded to\r\nRussia, are restored to Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe Sublime Porte cedes to Persia the town and territory of Khotou for\r\nits delimitation of the frontiers of Turkey and of Persia.[84]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Anglo-Turkish Convention._\r\n\r\nArticle I. Batoum, Ardahan, Kars, or any of them, shall be retained by\r\nRussia, and if any attempt shall be made at any future time by Russia to\r\ntake possession of any further territories of His Imperial Majesty the\r\nSultan in Asia, as fixed by the Definitive Treaty of Peace, England\r\nengages to join His Imperial Majesty the Sultan in defending them by\r\nforce of arms.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her\r\nengagement, His Imperial Majesty the Sultan further consents to assign\r\nthe island of Cyprus to be occupied and administrated by England.\r\n\r\nBeaconsfield having thus attained “peace with honour” for England,\r\nreturned, and in a speech[85] in the House, said, “They are not\r\nmovements of war, they are operations of peace and civilization; we have\r\nno reason to fear war. Her Majesty has fleets and armies which are\r\nsecond to none.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n                   REMARKS UPON THE TREATY OF BERLIN.\r\n\r\n  _The position of affairs—The Salisbury-Schouvaloft Memorandum and its\r\n    disastrous effect on the negotiations at Berlin—Russia’s\r\n    gain—England and Austria the guardians of Turkey—Austria’s vigorous\r\n    and straightforward Balkan policy—Thwarted in Servia but triumphant\r\n    in Bulgaria—Relations of Greece to Austria—Solution of the Crete\r\n    question—Neutrality of Belgium threatened—Importance of\r\n    Constantinople to Russia; the Anglo-Turkish Convention—England’s\r\n    feeble policy in Asia Minor—The question of Egypt—A new route to\r\n    India by railway from the Mediterranean to Persian Gulf—England’s\r\n    relation to Constantinople._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now review and make a few remarks on the Treaty of Berlin.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the whole treaty seems to me to be virtually a repetition[86]\r\nand revision of the conditions of the European concert in the Eastern\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck’s opinion was that the Treaty of San Stefano meant to\r\nalter “the state of things as fixed by former European Conventions,”\r\nconsequently the Berlin Congress followed for “the free discussion of\r\nthe Cabinets’ signatories of the treaties of 1856 and 1871.”\r\n\r\nThe Treaties of Paris and London being still in force, and owing to the\r\nrise of a new nationality and the redistribution of territory, these\r\ntreaties were altered and amended by the Congress.\r\n\r\nBefore we criticize the Treaty of Berlin we ought to bear two things in\r\nour mind. (1) At the Conference of Paris, 1856, England, France, and\r\nTurkey were victorious, while Russia was conquered. (2) At the Berlin\r\nCongress, 1878, Russia was victorious over Turkey, while England and\r\nFrance were neutral.\r\n\r\nIn both meetings it was asserted and claimed that the Powers\r\ncollectively had the right of settling the Eastern Question as against\r\nRussia’s single-handed interference, England leading the van with fair\r\nwords but selfish interests.\r\n\r\nOn Russia concluding the San Stefano Treaty with Turkey, England said\r\nthat, according to the conditions of the Treaty of Paris, the Great\r\nPowers of Europe “engaged each on its own part to respect the\r\nindependence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire,” and consequently\r\nTurkish affairs produced a general interest throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nRussia had committed a serious breach of “the law of nations” by a\r\ntreaty single-handed with Turkey. When the European Congress at Berlin\r\nwas consented to by Russia, England said that the Treaty of San Stefano\r\nwas not valid without the consent of the signatory Powers of the\r\nTreaties of Paris and London. She also demanded from Russia that, “in\r\nthe Congress itself, each Power should have full liberty of assent and\r\nfree action.” These demands seemed perfectly reasonable. However,\r\nEngland, before the Berlin meeting, contracted a secret agreement with\r\nRussia, in which the modifications asked for by England in the Treaty of\r\nSan Stefano were specified. This agreement did not leave out the\r\nbringing in of other changes by mutual consent, but, if these failed,\r\ntended to be a mutual engagement by the ambassadors of Russia and Great\r\nBritain as to their general behaviour and conduct at the Congress. This\r\nsecret agreement between the two Powers practically blocked the full\r\nliberty of the other Powers and the full amount of good they might\r\notherwise have done. England had been one of the first to attack Russia\r\nfor committing a breach of the Treaties of Paris and London; yet she\r\noverlooked the fact that she herself had morally broken the same\r\ntreaties by her secret negotiation with Russia, the other Powers not\r\nbeing at the time cognizant of the fact.\r\n\r\nOnce more Russia, by the Black Sea Conference, had gained full freedom\r\non the Black Sea, now she had regained the part of Bessarabia which she\r\nhad lost during the Crimean War, the principal object of which was to\r\ndrive Russia from the banks of the Danube. The above-mentioned territory\r\nwas ceded to Russia through the influence of Lord Salisbury, who had\r\nsecretly promised Schouvaloff, the Russian ambassador, that he would\r\nsupport the Russian demand with regard to that land.\r\n\r\nBy the Berlin Treaty England and Austria were invested with a special\r\nresponsibility for protecting the integrity of the Ottoman Empire\r\nagainst Russian aggression—England in Asia Minor, and Austria in the\r\nBalkans.\r\n\r\nIf Russia attacked through Asia Minor the English interests would be\r\nimperilled; and by the disappearance of the Balkan States, then Austria\r\nwould be open to Russian immediate attacks—a consummation which would be\r\nlittle desired by that Power.\r\n\r\nThis responsibility has undoubtedly from that time engrossed the\r\nattention of Austria and Hungary. She has had to encounter several\r\ndifficulties. Bessarabia was no longer a Turkish province, and had been\r\nceded to Russia by the Salisbury-Schouvaloff memorandum. Also there, was\r\nno possibility of the Balkan States being confederated owing to the\r\ndifferent races, language, and feelings of the nationality.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1879, Bismarck visited Vienna and concluded an\r\nAustro-German defensive alliance against the alliance of France and\r\nRussia. Bismarck, however, described the German policy in the following\r\nterse manner: “Fight by all means, if you feel yourself strong enough to\r\nbeat Russia single-handed. France and Germany will see all fair, and you\r\ncan hardly expect anybody effectually to help you.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these rather unfavourable circumstances, and her\r\nfinancial difficulties as well, still the policy of Austria is at the\r\npresent time carried on straightforwardly and vigorously, and the duty\r\nwith which she charged herself at the Berlin Treaty is ably done, and is\r\nwell backed up by the five million Magyars who inhabit Hungary and the\r\nadjoining provinces. This nation had been cruelly put under Austria by\r\nRussia (1848–49), and consequently their hatred against Russia was\r\ndeeply rooted.\r\n\r\nAt present, therefore, Russia’s schemes with regard to Constantinople\r\nhave been frustrated, and Austria holds the lead in the Balkan Peninsula\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAustria was asked to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to secure\r\npeace and order there. She did so, and, notwithstanding an armed\r\nresistance, entered and fulfilled her promise. She is now strengthening\r\nher hold on these states by stationary garrisons of soldiers in\r\ndifferent parts, and also Jesuits, who exercise a moral influence over\r\nthe people. The affairs of Servia have also deeply occupied the\r\nattention of the Austrian Government. She captured King Milan, and used\r\nhim as a tool for her own purposes. Russia, however, desired to get hold\r\nof Servia through the ex-queen.\r\n\r\nIntrigues at the Servian Court were numerous, and at last the miserable\r\ndivorce of the king and queen leaked out. The present young king\r\nascended the throne. This was a blow to the Austrian influence.\r\n\r\nBulgaria had been declared an independent country by the Berlin Treaty.\r\nOn this state the question of supremacy between Russia and Austria in\r\nthe Balkans hangs to a great degree. In 1855 Bulgaria and Eastern\r\nRoumelia were united into a single state. This revolution occasioned\r\nvery great displeasure in Russia, and under her influence Prince\r\nAlexander was kidnapped and compelled to abdicate, and Prince Ferdinand\r\nof Coburg was elected as the ruling prince.\r\n\r\nAlthough of German extraction, he is an Austrian by allegiance, and a\r\nRoman Catholic. He was originally an officer in the Hungarian army.\r\nThere seems to me no doubt that his election was illegal, because, in\r\nthe first place, by the Berlin Treaty the ruling prince must belong to\r\nthe Greek Church.\r\n\r\nPrince Ferdinand was quite ready to submit his claim for decision to the\r\nGreat Powers, and abide by the result. All the Powers except England and\r\nAustria declared that he had no claim to the crown, but the two had\r\ntheir own way, and he ascended the Bulgarian throne—another repulse and\r\nblow to Russian influence. Prince Alexander meanwhile was given a post\r\nin the Austro-Hungarian army. Only recently, to show the friendly spirit\r\nthat exists between Austria and Bulgaria, a loan has been concluded and\r\nadvanced by the former to the latter.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Austria committed a slight mistake in her policy with regard\r\nto Greece. She had arrogantly displayed her fleet and strength at\r\nSalonika, which no doubt was a source of irritation to Greece. Her best\r\npolicy would have been kindness and consideration, not forcible means,\r\nfor the prosperity of Austria was to a certain extent dependent on her\r\ntreatment of neighbouring countries, and, together with the Great Powers\r\nshe was to a certain extent dependent upon Greece’s action. The latter,\r\ntherefore, was a necessary bulwark against Russian encroachments, and\r\nwas thus of primary importance to England, France, and Italy. If,\r\ntherefore, the Turks were driven from Europe, Greece would occupy the\r\nplace of Turkey with regard to Russia, and would be the only obstacle to\r\nRussian Mediterranean advance. “I would never permit,” said the Czar\r\nNicholas, “such an extension of Greece as would render her a powerful\r\nstate.” Truly Greece might well be called the Belgium of the\r\nMediterranean!\r\n\r\nBy the Berlin Treaty the Porte was advised to cede Thessaly and Epirus\r\nto Greece. This was done, and as the Greeks were noted for being good\r\ntraders and sailors, great progress and improvement was made in their\r\nnewly acquired territory.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see the reason why the Berlin Congress did not advise\r\nthe Porte to cede Crete to Greece. If the island was left alone it would\r\nbe harmless, and exercise no influence on the naval supremacy of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nHowever, an occupation of Crete by a European Power would to a great\r\nextent change the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean, destroy\r\nEuropean tranquillity and peace, the Levant would be in the hands of the\r\nCretan occupiers. Again, its position would completely command the Ægean\r\nSea, and if properly fortified might be rendered almost impregnable. Its\r\nnatural wealth, population, and general productiveness afford ample\r\nresources both in times of war and peace; in fact, it might be very well\r\ntermed the Second Gate to the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nTherefore it seems to me the best policy to let this important island\r\nremain in a neutral state by an agreement between the Great Powers, and\r\nthe sooner it is agreed to the better it would be for the peace of\r\nEurope generally.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it would have been better to have placed it under Grecian\r\nrule for the following reasons:—\r\n\r\n(1) Because Greece herself was a neutral nation. (2) They were a\r\ncommercial people, and peaceful, which would have a beneficial effect\r\nupon the island. (3) More than half of the Cretan population are of\r\nGrecian extraction.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that if any one[87] of the Great Powers had proposed\r\nthe cession of Crete to Greece it would have met with the general\r\napprobation of the Congress. This would not have met with Turkish\r\nopposition, particularly as England had before the Berlin Congress\r\nmentioned it in the Anglo-Turkish agreement; and to show that Turkey did\r\nnot attach much importance to Crete, it is related in Turkish history\r\nthat it was offered to Mehemet Ali as a reward for his help in the Greek\r\ninsurrection; besides, the national force of Turkey was not large enough\r\nto utilize the strong natural position of the island.\r\n\r\nAustria,[88] unless she had been influenced by her national vanity,\r\nwould have agreed to such a proposal owing to the great value as a\r\nnational defence that she received from the Balkan States. Again,\r\nGermany, France, and Italy could find no reasonable argument for\r\nopposing this plan.\r\n\r\nThe policy of England with regard to a neutral state has always been to\r\nstrengthen its national power, and that to such a degree as to properly\r\nmaintain its fixed neutrality.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 England ceded the Java Islands to the Dutch on the formation of\r\nthe Netherlands at the Congress of Vienna. Why did she do this? For this\r\nreason: because by doing this the new States would be rendered neutral\r\nin case of a French or German invasion, and by this cession of Java the\r\nDutch national power was increased in every way, and their power of\r\nmaintaining a strict neutrality rendered stronger.\r\n\r\nAnother instance may strengthen my statement. Corfu, an important\r\nmilitary and naval post, was put under English protection at the Vienna\r\nCongress, 1815. Lord Palmerston at one time saw that it would be\r\nimpolitic to hand over Corfu to Austria, and declared that the islands\r\nought never to be abandoned by England.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the new kingdom of Greece was formed England cordially\r\nagreed to hand over Corfu and several other islands to Greece, on the\r\ncondition that the Greeks should choose a king subject to the approval\r\nof England. The fortifications of Corfu were demolished, and the\r\nneutrality of the islands was declared by the Great Powers.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, then, tend to show us that England was distinctly\r\nfavourable[89] to the cession of Crete to Greece, and they were\r\nconsiderably strengthened by the fact that Greece was an ally of\r\nEngland, and the commercial relations between the two were very free.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the marriage of the Crown Prince of Greece with a\r\nGerman Princess (1889) has morally strengthened the position and power\r\nof Greece. However, Greece still needs material strength for the\r\nmaintenance of a strict neutrality.\r\n\r\nTurning to another country, we find that it is a matter of considerable\r\ndoubt whether Belgium can maintain a firm neutrality in case of a\r\nFranco-German war. At the time of Lord Palmerston she might perhaps have\r\nbeen able to do so, but the recent discoveries in the world of science,\r\nand their application to military purposes, and the immense increase of\r\nthe French and German armies, have changed the military world, and the\r\nneutrality of Belgium is a doubtful point. In 1887 an important\r\ndiscussion on this question took place, which resulted in the\r\nfortification of Namur and Liege. This was followed by the fortification\r\nof the Meuse, but it is said that the Belgians have not enough troops to\r\ngarrison these newly-made defences. It has been publicly admitted in\r\nBelgium that their national force is not sufficient to defend a\r\nviolation of neutrality against France and Germany, therefore Belgium\r\nmust regard the first violator of her neutrality as her national enemy,\r\nand will be obliged to ally herself with a nation which is an enemy of\r\nthe state which has violated neutrality. This is not the Belgium which\r\nLord Palmerston meant it to be.\r\n\r\nAnother important fact is that since the Franco-German war German\r\nattention has been turned to the North Sea, and a new naval harbour and\r\narsenal have been built at Wihelmshafen. Two other large harbours in the\r\nNorth Sea have also been improved lately, viz., Hamburg and Bremen.\r\nKiel, the finest port on the Baltic, has been confiscated, and is now\r\nconnected with the North Sea by a canal, through which ships of large\r\ntonnage may one day pass. Numerous ironclads and fleets of large\r\nmerchant and emigrant steam vessels have been constructed which, in case\r\nof war, can be armed and turned into transports. Her land forces have\r\nbeen well organized and augmented, and military tactics scientifically\r\ndeveloped. From these threatening facts it is certain that in the event\r\nof a Franco-German war both Holland and Belgium would occupy most\r\ndangerous positions. Having these events staring them in the face, only\r\none expedient could present itself to the two states, viz., union. This\r\nwould enable them to show a powerful front to the rival Powers, and\r\nwould enable them both to maintain a united fixed neutrality, thus\r\nshowing Lord Palmerston’s mistaken policy of the separation of the two\r\nstates to be a weak one with regard to the present state of affairs,\r\nthough perhaps it may have served its purpose at that time.\r\n\r\nAll these arguments go to prove that a cession of Crete to Greece would\r\nbe beneficial to both European and Grecian interests.\r\n\r\nConstantinople was hardly mentioned in the Berlin Treaty, although it is\r\nsaid that Lord Beaconsfield had suggested to General Ignatieff a Russian\r\noccupation of the Bosphorus with an English one of Mitylene. Ignatieff\r\nsaid, however, that “Mitylene was too near, as it was only two hours’\r\nsteam from the north of the Dardanelles.” Lord Beaconsfield did not,\r\ntherefore, press the discussion. The importance of Constantinople can be\r\nexplained in a few words.\r\n\r\nBy possession of the Straits Russia would be able to make the Black Sea\r\na second Caspian, whose coasts are left undefended, and it would become\r\na great Russian arsenal, for ten or fifteen thousand troops would be\r\nsufficient to shut out an English fleet from the Straits, and by this\r\nmeans quite two hundred thousand Russian troops could be withdrawn from\r\nthe Black Sea and turned to the Balkans, Asia Minor, or Central Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Anglo-Turkish Convention._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that Austria has fulfilled her contract in\r\npreventing Russian aggression through the Balkans, yet Russia could find\r\na way through Asia Minor, although her progress through Asia was stopped\r\nby England at the Anglo-Turkish Convention.\r\n\r\nBy this treaty, however, England committed a still more grave and\r\nserious breach of the Treaties of 1856 and 1871 than by this Berlin\r\nTreaty. Yet although England and Russia had made a secret agreement\r\nbeforehand, still the Berlin Treaty was discussed and drawn up by the\r\nCongress. Therefore England was only morally to blame. But the\r\nAnglo-Turkish Convention was concluded between the two countries\r\nthemselves, and was never submitted for the consideration of the Great\r\nPowers. Lord Beaconsfield sought to screen England by declaring that\r\nRussia had concluded the San Stefano Treaty with Turkey without the\r\nknowledge and consent of the Powers, and Russia herself, therefore, had\r\nbroken the principles of the 1856 and 1871 Treaties. Yet this did not\r\nconceal the fact that England herself had not acted up to her tenets in\r\nthe Anglo-Turkish Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Porte ceded Ardahan, Kars, and Batoum, together with its port, to\r\nRussia. England occupied Cyprus, and engaged to defend Asiatic Turkey,\r\nSyria, Palestine, Assyria, Arabia, and Armenia, against Russian\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nHas England performed her contract in Asiatic Turkey as Austria has done\r\nin the Balkans? We will see. Cyprus is left almost in the same condition\r\nas it was before our English occupation, and nothing has been done by\r\nEngland for the defence of Asiatic Turkey, while only a few hundred\r\nsoldiers guard against a Russian invasion in Asia Minor. Surely this\r\ncannot be a sufficient number of men to withstand a Russian army. What,\r\nthen, has become of the Anglo-Turkish Convention? Russia has taken\r\nadvantage of this, and is doing her utmost to bring about war in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nBy the Berlin Treaty the Russian Emperor declared that it was his\r\n_intention_ to constitute Batoum a free port essentially commercial.\r\nLord Salisbury interpreted this remark that the port of Batoum was to be\r\n_only_ a commercial port. The Russian Emperor has, however, _changed his\r\nintention_, and Batoum is essentially a fortress, and is connected with\r\nPoti by a railway through Kutais.\r\n\r\nWhy cannot, therefore, Russia have an idea of breaking the Berlin Treaty\r\nwith equal freedom as England did with regard to the Treaties of 1856\r\nand 1871 by concluding the Anglo-Turkish Convention single-handed? It\r\nseems to me that Russia has a great opportunity of advancing to\r\nErzeroum, and from there proceeding to Alexandretta; and from there to\r\nConstantinople. At any rate she has ample opportunities of reaching the\r\nPersian Gulf by piercing the northern frontiers and western part of\r\nPersia, and thus completing the far-seeing policies of Peter the Great,\r\nNicholas, and Alexander.\r\n\r\nHow can England withstand this? When Cyprus was placed under English\r\nadministration both France and Italy were opposed to this, France\r\nespecially so, because she had a special interest with regard to Syria.\r\nHowever, she concluded a secret agreement with England, that the latter\r\nwould consent to a French Protectorate over Tunis, which was done in\r\n1881, a protectorate which is now extending to Tripoli. Many regard this\r\naction of France as an indirect third offer of Egypt to England, the\r\nfirst having been made by Nicholas I., and the second by Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nWhatever the French occupation of Tunis might be, England occupied Egypt\r\nin 1885, thus fulfilling Lord Palmerston’s prophecy of a quarter of a\r\ncentury before, when he said that “if a practicable waterway were\r\ncreated between the Gulf of Pelusium and the Red Sea England would be\r\ncompelled sooner or later to annex Egypt, and that he opposed M. de\r\nLessep’s scheme because he considered it undesirable that England should\r\nannex territory in that part of the world.”[90]\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal was opened in 1869, and Lord Palmerston’s prophecy was\r\nfulfilled. In 1875 the English Government purchased the Khedive’s shares\r\n(£4,000,000) in the Suez Canal, and this was followed by the bombardment\r\nof Alexandria by the British fleet in 1885. The chief aim of the English\r\noccupation of Egypt was “to possess the inns on the north road.”[91]\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to avoid the conflict of English and French\r\ninterests as long as there is only one route through the Suez Canal to\r\nIndia, and an Anglo-French alliance on the subject seems to be far\r\ndistant, particularly as England has three-fourths of the traffic\r\nthrough the canal.\r\n\r\nIt is also a matter of great importance that England should keep Egypt\r\norderly and peaceful. Lord Salisbury, in an excellent speech on Lord\r\nMayor’s Day, 1889, said:\r\n\r\n“We (English) have undertaken to sustain Egypt until she is competent to\r\nsustain herself against every enemy, foreign or domestic. We cannot see\r\nthat that time has yet arrived. It may arrive quicker or later. Other\r\nPowers may help us by concurring in measures which will improve the\r\nposition and increase the prosperity of Egypt, or they may defer that\r\nday by taking an opposite course. But whether the day comes sooner or\r\nlater, our policy remains unaltered, and we will pursue our task to the\r\nend.”\r\n\r\nWe can easily get at the pith of Lord Salisbury’s speech. If France\r\nagain became a co-partner of England in establishing peace and order in\r\nEgypt, then England would be quite willing to restore the dual control\r\nwith regard to Egypt, and Lord Salisbury in 1878 had declared that\r\nEngland did not desire to annex Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe dual control of France and England with regard to Egypt might\r\npossibly settle affairs there temporarily, or neutralize that country on\r\nthe same lines as Belgium; but still this is not a sufficient guarantee\r\nagainst an Anglo-French dispute on the Egyptian question.\r\n\r\nThe French Government of the present day is not noted for stability,\r\nalways changing, never agreeing, and ready for foreign quarrels, and\r\nalthough now they are supporting the English Government in Egypt, it is\r\nnot safe to depend upon them, for the feeling of rivalry is sure to\r\narise, and great caution has to be exercised in order to prevent\r\ncomplications arising. No matter what happens, England must have free\r\ncommunication with India, and as long as there is only one road,\r\nruptures will be inevitable, and there can be no firm alliance as in the\r\ncase of the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be a favourable time to suggest to Turkey the\r\nconstruction of a railway from Constantinople or some other port on the\r\nMediterranean to Bussorah on the Persian Gulf: why should not England\r\nundertake the construction herself? This route would certainly possess\r\nfour great advantages:\r\n\r\n(1) It would be a shorter route to India.\r\n\r\n(2) It would be a valuable means of quick transportation of either\r\nTurkish or English troops for the defence of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n(3) It would avoid a clashing of English and French interests in Egypt\r\nto a certain extent, and a dual control would thereby be strengthened,\r\nand would produce two more results, viz:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) A firmer alliance between England and France.\r\n\r\n(_b_) England would be able to reduce her troops in Egypt, and devote\r\nthem to the defence of Asia Minor, and by this means be more able to\r\nwithstand Russian attacks in that quarter and in Persia.\r\n\r\n(4) Lastly, Turkey would be strengthened financially owing to the\r\nprosperity of her commerce, and productions in Asia Minor, which is the\r\nusual effect of such a communication.\r\n\r\nBy this means England can fulfil her public duty to Turkey, which she\r\nhad undertaken to do by the Anglo-Turkish Convention, and can maintain\r\nher national honour pledged when Lord Beaconsfield and Count Andrassy\r\ndiscussed the defence of Turkey from Russian invasion in Asia and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see why this railway scheme was not brought forward\r\nat the Anglo-Turkish Convention, because it appears to me to be of\r\nprimary importance for the defence of both Asia Minor and India; and\r\nalso how it escaped the mind of so clever a statesman as Lord\r\nBeaconsfield.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been informally discussed both at political meetings\r\nand by pamphlet only recently: the financial difficulties seemed quite\r\nsurmountable, but political opinions are decidedly at variance on the\r\nsubject. But it is my opinion that England would be perfectly right in\r\ncompelling Turkey to carry out this scheme, and if she was not able to\r\nexecute it, then England could perform it herself, and she would be only\r\nfulfilling one of the duties which she has undertaken to perform with\r\nthe Sultan at the Anglo-Turkish Convention.\r\n\r\nThe following articles strangely enough appeared in one of the English\r\ndaily papers[92]:—\r\n\r\n“The tradition, adhered to even by Lord Beaconsfield, of remaining\r\nallied with Turkey at all hazards, is no longer advocated even by\r\nConservative occupants of the Foreign Office. Since the occupation by\r\nEngland of Cyprus, and still more of Egypt, Constantinople has lost much\r\nof its importance to England. The Russian fleet in the Black Sea would,\r\nin the event of war, pass through the Dardanelles, with or without the\r\nSultan’s consent, and advance into the Mediterranean. The rule of the\r\nSultan at Constantinople, therefore, no longer affords a guarantee\r\nagainst a Russian attack of the English possessions in the\r\nMediterranean. Russia already possesses a road to India _viâ_ Merv, and\r\nthe possession of Constantinople could afford her no resistance in this\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n“England, on the other hand, in the event of Russia’s impeding the\r\nconveyance of English troops through the Suez Canal, has at her disposal\r\nanother way to India, one which leads exclusively through British\r\ndominions—the new Canadian railway. One no longer thinks of defending\r\nIndia at Constantinople, but in Afghanistan and on the Anglo-Afghan\r\nfrontier. England has as much interest as the other Powers in preventing\r\nRussia from advancing towards Constantinople, but this is no longer held\r\nto be a vital interest that would have to be protected even by force of\r\narms.”\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a serious mistake in policy if backed up by the\r\nEnglish Government, even more so than that of the Duke of Wellington,\r\n1827–1830.\r\n\r\nIf Constantinople were once occupied by Russia, it is certain that\r\nTurkey would be a thing of the past, the Russian fleet on the Black Sea\r\nwould at once sail into the Mediterranean and attack the English\r\nsupremacy there. The Russian occupation would enable them to withdraw\r\nquite 200,000 troops from the Black Sea coasts which could be used for\r\nan attack on the Balkans, Armenia, or Central Asia; Cyprus would be lost\r\nto England, and Asia Minor to Turkey; Russia would have a largely\r\nincreased power in the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf would be no\r\nlonger open to English ships.\r\n\r\nIf the Franco-Russian alliance of to-day remained firm, and war was to\r\nbe declared, then England would only have two long routes to India:\r\n(_a_) round the Cape of Good Hope, (_b_) the new Canadian railway. Lord\r\nCharles Beresford said, “With the Cape well fortified and held by a\r\nmilitary force, England might laugh at the world.” But the Cape would be\r\nunsafe, owing to France having now firm hold of the Indian Ocean\r\n“Malta,” viz., Madagascar.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the new Canadian route passes exclusively through\r\nBritish dominions, yet it cannot be called a direct route, for it is\r\ncertainly a seven days longer journey than the Gibraltar route to\r\nCalcutta. Russia, on the other hand, could send an immense number of\r\ntroops in seven or ten days from Moscow to the Afghan frontiers, and in\r\nabout another extra day from St. Petersburg, or the Caucasian Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis would be all in favour of Russia gaining the first military move—a\r\nmatter of extreme importance in the present advanced stage of military\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\nThis question may also be viewed from two other points:—\r\n\r\nFirst, Cobden[93] and Bright were once under the idea that if Russia\r\noccupied Constantinople, she would change into a peaceful and civilized\r\nnation, and that England would be materially benefited commercially.\r\nThis was merely an imaginary dream, for there is no doubt in my mind\r\nthat a Russian occupation of the Turkish capital is a preliminary to\r\nshutting out English trade from the Black Sea by heavy protective\r\nduties. Second, England has engaged herself, together with the other\r\nEuropean Powers, to respect the integrity and independence of the\r\nOttoman Empire by the Treaties of Paris, London, and Berlin, and still\r\nmore emphatically by the Anglo-Turkish Convention. If, therefore, she\r\nfollowed the policy of leaving Constantinople to its fate, and simply\r\ndefended her interests on the Afghan frontiers, she would at once be\r\nbranded with disgrace, and stigmatized as a breaker of the 1856, 1871,\r\nand 1878 Treaties, and a backslider from the Anglo-Turkish Convention.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, however, an indirect change of policy may be\r\nobserved. Early in March, 1889, the First Lord of the Admiralty (Lord\r\nGeorge Hamilton) introduced and passed the Naval Defences Bill,\r\nauthorizing an expenditure of £21,500,000 on the Navy by constructing\r\neight first and two second-class battle-ships, nine first-class and\r\nthirty-three smaller cruisers, and eighteen torpedo gunboats. This\r\nsurely implies that England is determined to prevent Russian\r\nencroachments both at Constantinople and in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nReviewing the above, the following things seem plainly revealed, viz.,\r\nthat Russia has in the majority of cases assumed an offensive policy\r\nwhile England has maintained a defensive one with regard to Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nPitt started a splendid scheme of resistance against Russia; Canning\r\nworked upon it, and developed the European Concert scheme with regard to\r\nTurkey; Palmerston improved, expanded, and eventually completed a\r\nperfectly harmonious unison; while Beaconsfield composed and worked\r\nvariations upon the original strain of the Concert. Surely the example\r\nof such noble and great statesmen is worthy of veneration both in the\r\npresent and the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n                             CENTRAL ASIA.\r\n\r\n  _Rise of British power in India—Rivalry of France—Aims of\r\n    Napoleon—Russian influence in Central Asia—Its great extension after\r\n    the Crimean War—And after the Berlin Congress—Possible points of\r\n    attack on India—Constantinople the real aim of Russia’s Asiatic\r\n    policy—Recent Russian annexations and railways in Central\r\n    Asia—Reaction of Asiatic movements on the Balkan question—Dangerous\r\n    condition of Austria—Possible future Russian advances in\r\n    Asia—England’s true policy the construction of a speedy route to\r\n    India by railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf—Alliance\r\n    of England, France, Turkey, Austria, and Italy would effectively\r\n    thwart Russian schemes._\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not mean to detain my readers for any length of time upon this\r\ntedious subject which has been so often discussed. I shall sketch the\r\npolicy of England and Russia in the region in question. However, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that the subject is important, as it leads up to the\r\ngreat Pacific Question which will occupy European attention for many\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the British Empire in India dates from the Battle of\r\nPlassey, June 23, 1757, and Clive’s Second Governorship of the East\r\nIndia Company established the India administration on a firm basis.\r\n\r\nWarren Hastings improved and properly organized the foundation laid by\r\nClive, and Lord Cornwallis consolidated Bengal and the other chief\r\nstates, and rendered them fairly secure.\r\n\r\nLord Wellesley was the first who felt fully convinced that England\r\nshould be the permanent predominant Power in India, and he carried out\r\nthis policy by extensive subsidiary alliances with native princes by\r\nwhich the states were placed under British protection.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this policy was suggested by “the great events that were\r\ntaking place in Europe, where French ideas and French arms under the\r\ngenius of Bonaparte were reducing kingdoms and states to provinces of an\r\nEmpire.”[94]\r\n\r\nLord Minto first opened relations with the Punjaub, Afghanistan, and\r\nPersia. He was succeeded by Lord Moira, who saw that the British\r\nfrontiers in India could never be secured till the natural barrier of\r\nthe Himalayas and the sea were reached; while Lord Dalhousie proved a\r\nfaithful follower and improver of this policy, and at last made India a\r\ncompletely organized state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _England’s Opponents in British India._\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese ascendency in India was of short duration. It was\r\nfollowed by a keen rivalry between the English and French, the former\r\neventually obtaining the precedence. This was owing to the naval\r\nsuperiority of the English in Indian seas, under the wise guidance of\r\nChatham, supported by the skilful military and civil administration of\r\nClive and Hastings.\r\n\r\nIn 1797–1798 Napoleon threatened to invade India from the north; first\r\nhe threatened an attack from the Deccan, then in the latter part of the\r\nyear he concluded an alliance with several Asiatic princes preparatory\r\nto another attack from the same quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis Wellesley was at once sent out and landed in Madras, April\r\n26, 1798. Affairs seemed critical. Napoleon was preparing for a great\r\ninvasion of Egypt prior to a descent on India. Tippoo Sultan, in India,\r\nwas raising troops, disciplined under French management, and\r\nstrengthened by French help, commanded by Raymond. Rao Sindia (the\r\nMahratta ruler), the Peshawar (Governor of Poonah), the Ameer of\r\nAfghanistan, and Holkar were all hostile to English interests in India,\r\nand threatened to plunge everything into war with the assistance of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nWellesley plainly saw that a defensive policy was the best. Accordingly\r\nhe made an alliance with some of the Mahratta powers to frustrate a\r\nFrench invasion from the north. He also strongly urged the English Home\r\nGovernment to take possession of the Cape of Good Hope, and the Isles of\r\nFrance and Bourbon, in order to cut off the sea route to India from\r\nFrance. This advice was followed by the English Government, who retained\r\nMalta, Mauritius, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Ionian Islands by the\r\nprovisions of the Congress of Vienna, 1815.\r\n\r\nHe then began to crush Tippoo Sultan and his allies, and by the\r\nbrilliant victories of Assaye and Argaum brought them to his feet.\r\nHaving conquered these Native states he now began to take measures to\r\nconsolidate them. He allowed the princes to retain their titles, but\r\nsubjected them to the English Power, which secured them from foreign\r\naggression, and also let them have full liberty with regard to internal\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nOn his recall in 1805 a policy of non-interference was carried on by his\r\nsuccessor, Lord Cornwallis.\r\n\r\nDuring the Napoleonic European War, Lord Minto was Governor-General.\r\nUnder his able administration the French Isles of Bourbon and Mauritius\r\nand the Dutch East Indian Islands were captured. He also sent political\r\nmissions into Persia, Sindia, and Poonah to crush down the French\r\ninfluence and intrigue there.\r\n\r\nNapoleon fell in 1815, and the most formidable opponent to British\r\nIndian interests disappeared.\r\n\r\nYet the Marquis of Hastings and his successors still carried out the\r\nsame policy of annexation as had been in existence during the alarms of\r\nNapoleon, and the Indian frontiers have ever since been keenly watched\r\nand guarded from foreign attack. The second Mahratta War (1817–1819) and\r\nthe first Burmese War (1824–1826) are instances of British watchfulness\r\nover the frontiers.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, Russia appeared on the scene in the place of\r\nFrance, and the drama of the Anglo-Russian struggle in Afghanistan was\r\nenacted in 1837.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE EXPANSION OF RUSSIA IN ASIA.]\r\n\r\nFor some time previously Russia had been gradually advancing into\r\nCentral Asia. This movement started with Peter the Great, while\r\nAlexander I. arranged with Napoleon by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) to\r\nannex whatever he pleased in Central Asia. Hence the Russian boast of\r\nNicholas that “Russia has no boundary in Central Asia.” For some time,\r\nhowever, Turkish affairs occupied the Russian minds, and Asia was left\r\nuntouched, while for twenty or thirty years after the fall of Napoleon,\r\nall the great countries were endeavouring to restore the balance of\r\npower in Europe. Then in 1830 Russia began to show her hand, and seized\r\nJaxartes, and in 1837 the siege of Herat by the Persians (no doubt\r\nincited by the Russians), which is sometimes called the north-western\r\ngate of India, and the failure of negotiations with Dost Mohammed, who\r\nwas backed by Russian influence, urged the English to take strong\r\nmeasures in order to protect India from Russian invasion, especially\r\nthrough the two Afghan Passes, the Bolon and Khyber.\r\n\r\nThe first English move was the sending of an expedition to Cabul, and\r\nits occupation in 1839. Its intention was to place a ruler over\r\nAfghanistan who should be under English influence. This was considered\r\ndefensive policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Lord Palmerston wrote to Lord John Russell the following:—\r\n\r\n“The roads through Persia are good, and the Caspian gives additional\r\nfacilities. From Astrabad through Afghanistan are very practicable\r\nmilitary roads. A Russian force in occupation of Afghanistan might\r\nconvert Afghanistan into the advanced post of Russia.”\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Sind (1843), Punjaub (1849), Oudh (1856), and the\r\nsecond Burmese War (1852), are all policies on the same lines.\r\n\r\nJust at this period Russia was warmly engaged with Turkish affairs, and\r\nin 1853–1856 was employed in the Crimean War against England, France,\r\nand Turkey. She was beaten, and by the Treaty of Paris was driven back\r\nfrom the Danube, and forbidden to put a Russian fleet of any description\r\nin the Black Sea, and the fortifications of Sebastopol were dismantled.\r\nThus a Russian advance on the Balkans and Armenia seemed then almost\r\nhopeless. Therefore she turned her attention to Central Asia, and\r\nvigorously carried out her plans for several years.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the Russian forces captured Tchenken, in Turkestan, and she had\r\nadvanced as far as the river Syr Daria. In 1865 she declared war with\r\nBokhara, and captured Taskend, which was followed by the surrender of\r\nKhojind (1866).\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the province of Syr Adria was annexed, and in the same year\r\nNicholas installed a Russian Government in Turkestan. In 1868 Samarcand\r\nwas subjugated, and the Ameer of Bokhara was practically made a vassal\r\nof the Czar. In 1869 Krasnovodok, on the east coast of the Caspian, next\r\nfell a prey to Russian greed, and a fort was built there, and at present\r\nforms one of the Russian military outposts.\r\n\r\nDuring and after the Franco-German War she was busily engaged in Central\r\nAsia, and still increased and extended her boundaries, until at length\r\nthe Oxus was reached, and the Clarendon boundary in 1872 for a time\r\nstopped her roving footsteps. In 1873, however, the whole territory of\r\nthe Khan of Khiva was drawn in, and the river Atrak was now the boundary\r\nwith Persia. Zerafshan next fell before her, and now the Tian Shan\r\nmountains and the eastern part of Semipolatinsk formed the eastern\r\nboundary with China. Lastly, 1876 saw the annexation of Ferghana.\r\n\r\nLet us now direct our attention to the English frontiers and territory,\r\nwhich she was trying to consolidate more firmly.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Mutiny of 1857 had led to the transferring of the Government\r\nof India from the East India Company to the Crown, and the reins of\r\ngovernment from a Governor-General to a Viceroy (1858). The tour of the\r\nPrince of Wales through India, 1875–1876, had done a good deal of good\r\nin creating a friendly feeling with the natives, and he had met with a\r\nbrilliant reception. This was the preliminary to Queen Victoria being\r\nproclaimed Empress of India in 1877.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Turkish War (1878), the San Stefano Treaty, and the Congress\r\nof Berlin, produced a new phase in the Afghan question. The opposition\r\nof Austria to Russia at the Balkans, the defence of England in Asia\r\nMinor, both by the provisions of the Berlin Treaty, and the\r\nAnglo-Turkish Convention had frustrated the schemes of Russia in Europe;\r\nshe therefore turned her undivided energies to her advance in Central\r\nAsia, with the object of dividing the attention and forces of the\r\nEnglish between Asia Minor and the Afghan frontiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the final conquest of the Turcomans along the northern frontier\r\nof Persia and the east coast of the Caspian facilitated her designs, and\r\nAskhabad was occupied. The dispute of the Kulja frontier with China was\r\na winning move also in the eastern direction, also a part of\r\nSemipolatinsk was added, and fresh boundaries were made in the\r\nsouth-west of Ferghana towards the Chinese Empire, which measure caused\r\nEngland to adopt a defensive policy by the third Burmese War (1885).\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the Russo-Merv Convention was concluded, finally deciding the\r\nsubmission of the latter, while in 1884 “His Imperial Highness (of\r\nRussia) had determined to accept the allegiance of the Merv-Turcomans,\r\nand to send an officer to administer the government of that region.”[95]\r\nThe annexation of Merv gave Russia possession of the river Murghab,\r\ngiving her an opportunity of having a waterway to Herat if needed.\r\n\r\nThis action compelled England to appoint a Commission to define the\r\nNorth-West frontier of Afghanistan (1885). England at this time was\r\nworried also with Egyptian affairs. Russia, notwithstanding, advanced\r\nand occupied Sarakhs and various other posts on the North-West frontier,\r\nall being strategically important. This aroused the English Government,\r\nwho at once asked for a vote of credit of £11,000,000, and began to show\r\nsuch a determined front that Russia was compelled to make certain\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the conclusion of the negotiations it was found that Russia\r\nhad pushed herself a considerable distance towards Herat, and had\r\nreached Ak Robat, while the railway to Samarcand was nearly finished.\r\nThus Russia certainly scored a winning point, and, if desirous, could\r\nattack the Anglo-Indian frontier by three ways:\r\n\r\n(1) By advancing towards Cabul from Bokhara across the Oxus.\r\n\r\n(2) By marching towards Candahar _viâ_ Herat by the Meshed line.\r\n\r\n(3) By attacking the same place through the Attric Valley and Merv\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled condition of the boundary between the Oxus and the Heri\r\nRud, and particularly the Upper Oxus, will undoubtedly prove a source of\r\ndiscord between Russia and England for many years to come.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the strenuous efforts of Russia in advancing, and extending\r\nher power and boundaries in Central Asia, yet her great and absorbing\r\nthought was not revealed openly to the watchful eyes of European Powers,\r\nviz., to have full control of Constantinople, the key to the Black Sea,\r\nand by obtaining this to command the Mediterranean and be paramount in\r\nWestern Europe.\r\n\r\nA favourite manœuvre in military operations is to try and divert an\r\nopponent’s eyes from the true point of attack, and by so doing to weaken\r\nthe opposition at that point.\r\n\r\nAs we have casually mentioned before, the elder Pitt “conquered America\r\nin Germany,” and afterwards when Charles III. of Spain concluded a\r\nsecret Treaty known as the (third) “Family compact” with France,\r\nintending really to make war upon England, Chatham “determined to attack\r\nwithout delay the Havannah and Philippine Islands.”\r\n\r\nAgain, as another illustration of the above statement, we saw that\r\nNapoleon’s Egyptian expedition and his invasion of Russia were really\r\nunderhand blows at England.\r\n\r\nBut why did he not attack America or Ireland? Surely if he had sailed\r\ndirectly from Brest, 1798, to either of the above places, instead of\r\ngoing to Egypt as he did, with the combined fleets of France, Spain, and\r\nHolland, he would have dealt a much deadlier blow at British power.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the policy of Russia which has caused me to make the\r\nabove statement.\r\n\r\nCatherine II. had resolved to reach Constantinople through the Balkan\r\nPeninsula. Pitt withstood this resolution by supporting the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, together with Austria, as conducive to the interests of both\r\nnations. Austria, therefore, became an enemy of Russia.\r\n\r\nAlexander I., therefore, seeing the united interests of England, France,\r\nAustria, and Turkey allied against him, changed his front and determined\r\nto reach Constantinople along the Caucasian route. He plainly saw that\r\nby this manœuvre he would compel England and France to defend the\r\nCaucasus.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his career the Czar Nicholas followed the same plans\r\nas his predecessor, but carried them out much more firmly; he increased\r\nhis field of operations by invading Persia, 1826–1828, and occupied\r\nArmenia.\r\n\r\nBy this measure, no doubt, he expected to attract either England or\r\nFrance, perhaps both of them, to the Caucasian Question, thereby\r\nweakening the power of their alliance in the Balkans. France certainly\r\nwould feel considerable uneasiness for the Holy Places which had a\r\nspecial charm for her Catholic followers. England would also have felt\r\nqualms, seeing that if Russia occupied Persia, and made it an outpost\r\nfor attacking India through Afghanistan she would have considerable\r\ntrouble in defending her possession. However, this scheme did not prove\r\nso effective as Nicholas wished, for it did not divide the attention of\r\nEngland and France in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nRussia, therefore, perceiving this, followed the Napoleonic scheme of a\r\ndirect attack on India with the help of several Asiatic states. In 1830\r\nshe first appeared in Central Asia and soon subjugated Persia and\r\ninduced the Shah to occupy Herat, 1837. Alarmed at this, the whole\r\nenergy of England was directed towards Afghanistan, and special\r\npreparations, which lasted for a quarter of a century, were made to\r\ndefend an attack from that quarter. The home affairs of England,\r\ntogether with these alarming schemes of Russia with regard to India,\r\ndetermined the Wellington Ministry to advocate non-interference in\r\nBalkan affairs.\r\n\r\nRussia also removed French opposition from the Balkans to Syria by\r\nstirring up quarrels between the Greek and Latin Churches in Jerusalem.\r\nIn addition to this, as I have shown, Nicholas separated England and\r\nFrance by his diplomatic tact.\r\n\r\nThus Turkey was left alone with Austria in the Balkans. Nicholas then,\r\nfeeling confident of success, at once threatened Constantinople by\r\ntaking the steps which led to the Crimean War. He, however, overreached\r\nhimself, and was beaten, as we have seen, by the allied armies of\r\nEngland, France, and Turkey.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Crimean War Russia again stretched out her hands\r\non Persia as she had done in 1837. Lord Palmerston, however, closed them\r\nby declaring war with the same country. “We are beginning,” wrote Lord\r\nPalmerston, “to repel the first openings of trenches against India by\r\nRussia, and whatever difficulties Ferokh may make about Afghanistan we\r\nmay be sure that Russia is his prompt and secret backer.”[96]\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the peace of Paris was concluded by which the Shah renounced all\r\nclaim over Herat and Afghanistan. This was a clever political stroke\r\nagainst a Russian attack on India.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Lord Palmerston wrote:—\r\n\r\n“Persia must, I (Lord Palmerston) fear, now be looked on as an advanced\r\npost for Russia whenever she chooses to make use of it. She will command\r\nit either by overpowering force or by bribing the state by prospect of\r\nacquisition in Afghanistan.”\r\n\r\nHowever, ultimately the same policy was again resorted to by the Czar to\r\nworry England in Central Asia. Again the Russians advanced into Central\r\nAsia towards the Indian frontier and extended their borders both south\r\nand east with great celerity.\r\n\r\nBut a fresh complication arose extremely favourable for Russian plots.\r\nThe Franco-German War (1870) seemed to be an introduction to the\r\naccomplishment of her wishes. France was miserably defeated, while the\r\nhands of Germany were fully tied up with Alsace and Lorraine. Two\r\nformidable opponents to Russian arms were therefore placed _hors de\r\ncombat_. England and Austria were thus the only powers left for the\r\ndefence of Constantinople. Austria had previously been weakened by a war\r\nwith Prussia. It therefore seemed that England was the only strong\r\nsupporter of the Ottoman Empire, and Russia determined to _conquer\r\nTurkey in Central Asia_, so she conquered and annexed Central Asia as\r\nfar as possible until her boundaries reached Afghanistan and the Chinese\r\nEmpire in 1874. Being naturally alarmed at these encroachments, England\r\nagain was obliged to devote all her energies to the Indian and Afghan\r\nfrontiers, and engaged in the Afghan War.\r\n\r\nRussia now saw that she was in a better position with regard to Turkey\r\nthan she had been before the Crimean War, for although Turkey was still\r\nassisted by Austria, yet the latter had not fully recovered from the\r\nPrusso-Austrian War. Again France was in a convulsed state, while\r\nEngland was harassed with Afghan affairs. A general alliance of the\r\nMediterranean Powers seemed therefore impossible.\r\n\r\nRussia, therefore, boldly declared war in 1878, and marched to the gates\r\nof Constantinople, and eventually concluded the San Stefano Treaty. This\r\naroused both England and Austria, and, owing to their warlike attitude,\r\nthe Berlin Congress was convened, and Russia again found her hands\r\nwithheld from the Turkish metropolis, although she succeeded in\r\ndefinitely dividing the attention of England and Austria in the Balkans\r\nby turning English eyes towards Asia Minor. Her success was still\r\ngreater in obtaining the outlet of the Danube and the arsenal of Batoum\r\nin the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nGlancing, then, at the situation generally, one can perceive that Russia\r\nsaw that the English opposition in Asia Minor would prove formidable,\r\nbut she did not think that the Austrian defence of the Balkans would\r\nturn out so dangerous to her hopes. Her reasons for thinking this were\r\nplain. England at this crisis was a nation of the first magnitude, both\r\nin strength and wealth, and if only she (England) had fortified and\r\noccupied Cyprus as she ought to have done, she would have proved a\r\nvaluable ally to Turkey, and would also have commanded the Ægean Sea.\r\nRussia saw that the most advantageous policy would be to distract\r\nEngland’s attention both from Cyprus and Asia Minor. To accomplish this\r\nshe for the _third time started to conquer Turkey through Central Asia_.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 she concluded a secret agreement with Persia by which the\r\nterritory down to Sarakhs from the Russian frontier was ceded, to her.\r\nHer influence in Khorasan was increasing day by day, and especially so\r\nin Meshed, owing to the skill and tact of M. Vlassoff, the Russian\r\nConsul-General in that district. India was again threatened by her, and\r\nHerat approached. Her boundaries were extended into the Chinese\r\ndominions, and great uneasiness was caused in England concerning the\r\nboundary question of the Oxus.\r\n\r\nThe most effective and important step, however, taken by Russia for the\r\naccomplishment of her schemes, was the construction of the\r\nCaspian-Samarcand Railway. It was started in 1881 with the primary\r\nobject of facilitating the war operations of General Skobeloff for the\r\nreduction of the Tekkes. Lord Hartington called General Annenkoff, the\r\npromoter of the railway, “a foolish fellow.” However, Samarcand was\r\nreached in 1885, during the time that an Anglo-Russian war was\r\nthreatening about the Murghab question. Thus a general military[97]\r\ncommunication of Russia with Asia was established. She had three ways of\r\nsending troops and materials in the direction of the eastern shores of\r\nthe Caspian:—\r\n\r\n(1) From St. Petersburg to Saratoff on the Volga, _viâ_ Moscow, by\r\nrailway, from there to Astrakhan by steamboat on the river, and from the\r\nlatter place to Krasnovodsk or Uzan Ada.\r\n\r\n(2) From St. Petersburg to Voladis Caucase per railway, from thence to\r\nTiflis by post road (an eighteen hours’ journey), from Tiflis to Baku by\r\nrailway, and from there to Uzan Ada.\r\n\r\n(3) From Odessa or the Crimea to Poti on the eastern Black Sea coast by\r\nsteam, from Poti to Baku, and from there to Uzan Ada.\r\n\r\nThe water traffic across the Caspian, from its different ports is\r\ncarried on by fifteen ships of the Caucasus and Mercury Company. They\r\nare in receipt of a large annual subsidy from the state for the\r\nconveyance of mails and troops, and also for the use of their boats for\r\ntransport in case of war. One of these fifteen steamers sails from Baku\r\nto Uzan Ada twice a week.[98]\r\n\r\nThe Trans-Caucasian Railway starts from the latter place, running east\r\nand afterwards north-east to Merv. From there it proceeds in the same\r\ndirection, crossing the Oxus, passing Bokhara, and eventually terminates\r\nat Samarcand—a distance altogether of about nine hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe work of laying the rails was done by two battalions of Russian\r\nsoldiers (five hundred each) and also by five thousand native labourers,\r\nwhose wage was threepence a day. Wages have since been increased to\r\nsixpence a day. From the amount expended in labour we can see that the\r\nrailway expense did not prove inordinately dear, viz., 30,000,000\r\nroubles, including also the cost of the Siberian Railway, especially as\r\nthe Russian estimate at first was 60,000,000 roubles. The average rate\r\nof laying the rails was exceedingly rapid, viz., four or five miles a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThere are now one hundred and four locomotives and one thousand two\r\nhundred wagons, fifteen new locomotives have lately been ordered, six\r\nnew passenger wagons, and eighty cistern cars. A commission has recently\r\nreported in favour of a further grant to General Annenkoff of 8,000,000\r\nroubles.[99]\r\n\r\nThis line has opened a wide field for trade with Central Asia. The\r\ntraffic in 1888 alone was about £3,000,000, and General Annenkoff\r\nannounced that the net profit of the railway in 1888 amounted to about\r\n£80,000, that 2,000,000 pods of cotton had been conveyed by it during\r\nthe same year, and that in 1889 a total of 4,000,000 pods was\r\nanticipated.[100]\r\n\r\nViewing from a political and strategical point of view this railway has\r\nbeen an even more important factor. The northern frontier of Persia by\r\nits means has been placed completely at the mercy of Russia, and by it\r\nshe was enabled to consolidate her new Asiatic territories which she had\r\nannexed and conquered, Russian troops were able to be transported to the\r\nAfghan frontier at a very short notice from all parts of Russia.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the construction of the Trans-Caspian Railway and its\r\nthreatening results have proved of immense value for the success of\r\nRussia. By its means England was induced to turn her attention from Asia\r\nMinor to Indian affairs. This resulted in embroiling England with the\r\nsecond Afghan War, compelled her to appoint a boundary commission, and\r\nplunged her into the third Burmese War. All these catastrophes compelled\r\nher to neglect her Anglo-Turkish Convention promises—a result aimed at\r\nby her Russian friends(?)\r\n\r\nEven in Persia English influence is at a discount, and proportionately\r\nRussian influence is rising. The appointment of Sir H. D. Wolff, a\r\nclever diplomatist, to the Teheran Court, and the brilliant reception\r\naccorded to the Shah during his recent visit by the English, were too\r\nlate to do any good. It may do good, and it may not.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what effect upon Austria the Russo-Asiatic policy had.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Austria had been left alone to cope with Russia in the Balkans,\r\nand she was practicably left to defend the Ottoman Empire. France and\r\nGermany were practicably disarmed, and were unable materially, to assist\r\nTurkey against Russia. England, as we have seen before, was occupied\r\nelsewhere, and had practically deserted Asia Minor, although this might\r\nbe altered if only she would station troops at Cyprus or somewhere near\r\nat hand. Austria did not wish for a naval alliance only, which she\r\nconsidered practically useless in event of war, but she wanted a\r\ncomplete alliance. An alliance between the two Powers failed at the\r\nBerlin Congress, and also in October, 1886.\r\n\r\nThus Russia obtained her desires in dividing the two Powers in Europe\r\nand Asia, and prevented a general alliance by threatening Central Asia.\r\n\r\nCertainly Austria had performed her Balkan duty well, although she was\r\nclearly overweighted, and the result was internal exhaustion, financial\r\ndifficulties, social discontent, the result of pecuniary troubles.[101]\r\n\r\nOf all the great European cities, the socialists are at the present\r\nmoment strongest in Vienna. An able political writer of the present day\r\nhas said: “The Dualism of the Monarchy (Austria-Hungary) is very nearly\r\ndead, and if Austria is to exist at all she must rapidly become\r\ntripartite, and ultimately resolve herself into a somewhat loose\r\nconfederation.”[102]\r\n\r\nThese domestic difficulties have caused her to gradually lose her\r\ninfluence in the Balkans, and the abdication of King Milan of Servia has\r\nproved a still more serious blow to her power in that quarter.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me impolitic for Russia to go to war with the five million\r\nMagyars. It would be better to influence Austria so as to increase her\r\ninternal discords and foster them by skilful diplomacy if she wished to\r\nattain her objects. For instance, to demonstrate against the accession\r\nof Prince Ferdinand to the Bulgarian throne, to oppose the Bulgarian\r\nloans, and give pecuniary help herself to immigrants from Montenegro to\r\nServia.\r\n\r\nThe consequence would be that Austria could not possibly remain peaceful\r\nwhen inhabited by bitter anti-Russian Magyars. She would have to make\r\nwar preparations and spend money, and would thus increase her financial\r\ndifficulties, and the result would be the breaking down of the Dual\r\nMonarchy, “the personal union of fifty-six states,” a mixture of races,\r\nreligions, and tongues.\r\n\r\nA strong and compact confederation can only be obtained by sound\r\nfinancial dealings. Austria once broken down by internal discord, then\r\nConstantinople and the Balkans would be Russian possessions.\r\n\r\nIf Russia is desirous of accomplishing her ends, her great aim must be\r\nto prevent any of the great Powers from making an alliance with Austria.\r\nOwing to the Franco-Russian alliance, Russia is quite powerful enough to\r\nhinder any effective alliance with Germany.\r\n\r\nWith regard to an alliance with England, there is one strong barrier\r\nwhich, if kept up, will always prevent such a coalition, viz., the\r\nTrans-Caspian Railway.\r\n\r\nThe following ideas would still further separate the two Powers:—\r\n\r\n(1) The extension of the railway from Samarcand to Kokan, because from\r\nKokan Russia can threaten to push on her border to Eastern Turkestan,\r\nand move southward to Tibet, and from there will be able to threaten the\r\nterritory of Cashmere, which are the boundaries at present unsettled.\r\n\r\n(2) An extension of railway from Samarcand to Tashkend, which is\r\ncontemplated, and when completed will connect Siberia from a military\r\npoint of view. It can be also taken north-west, along the north-eastern\r\nshore of the Aral Sea, and may be connected with the parent line at\r\nOrenburg, and connected with Russia and Central Asia for military\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n(3) To construct a line from Mertvi, or Dead Bay, on the Caspian, to the\r\nwestern shore of the Sea of Aral. This would prove another quick mode of\r\ntransit, particularly from St. Petersburg and Moscow to Kilif, on the\r\nOxus, and also to Samarcand. At present steamers ply on the Amu Daria\r\nfrom the Aral Sea southwards as far as Kilif on the northern boundary of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\nThese steamers are 20 feet broad, 150 feet long, and are of 500–horse\r\npower, travelling 16 miles an hour, and are capable of conveying 300\r\nsoldiers and 20 officers.\r\n\r\n(4) To throw off a branch line from Bokhara to Kilif, and from there to\r\nBalkh.\r\n\r\n(5) Two branch lines (_a_) from Merv to Herat, _viâ_ Penjdeh; (_b_) from\r\nMerv to Sarakhs, _viâ_ Chacha, and still further to Kuhsan, in the\r\ndirection of Herat.\r\n\r\n(6) By entering the Persian dominion from the present northern boundary\r\nto occupy Meshed, proceeding thence to Kuhsan to meet the line from\r\nSarakhs.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the approaching departure for Persia of M. de\r\nBuelzoff, the newly-appointed minister at Teheran, most of the Russian\r\nnewspapers warmly advocated the immediate construction of a line from\r\nthe northern part of Persia.\r\n\r\n(7) An extension of railway from Meshed through Khorasan and Serstan\r\nsouthwards as far as Nasirabad, and eventually to get a port on the\r\nPersian Gulf or Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nOnce let Russia get the long-wished-for outlet in the southern seas, and\r\nthen she will be still more able to strike another blow against English\r\ninfluence. There is not the least doubt that Persian affairs will occupy\r\nthe attention of England for some years to come.\r\n\r\nAll these extensions will, if carried out, mean a Russian invasion all\r\nalong the Hindostan frontier, and thus would further indirectly her\r\nEuropean aspiration.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, looking from an English point of view, we can suggest\r\na scheme of frustration by means of sound and politic administration.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at present large railways start from Calcutta, Madras, and\r\nBombay, traversing Delhi and Lahore, terminating at Peshawar; from\r\nLahore the line runs to Kurrachee, on the Arabian Sea, and a branch line\r\ngoes north-west from Sakkar to Pishin, _viâ_ Quetta. Thus we see the\r\nEnglish defence of her Indian frontier is fairly well looked after,\r\nalthough a “_forward_” policy of railway construction in India may, and\r\nno doubt will, be advantageous to English defence and commerce.\r\n\r\nEngland is certainly heavily handicapped owing to the want of a short\r\nand safe communication with India. The Suez Canal is not safe enough,\r\nboth the Canadian Railway and the Cape of Good Hope routes are long,\r\ntherefore it is a matter of great moment that she should have a safe and\r\nquick route by which she might despatch troops and materials with\r\ncelerity.\r\n\r\nThe following route, if carried out, would prove of the very greatest\r\nadvantage to England. First, the occupation of the Karrack Island in the\r\nPersian Gulf, which is in every respect suitable for a military station,\r\nhaving good water and being healthy. It is with truth often termed the\r\nkey of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nSecondly, a railway should be constructed from Scandarum, on the\r\nMediterranean, to Bussorah, on the Persian Gulf, through the Euphrates\r\nValley—a saving of from seven hundred to one thousand miles, and of\r\nnearly four days.\r\n\r\nIf an Afghan war arose, troops could be landed at Kurrachee instead of\r\nBombay, and time would be gained and the monsoon also avoided. Troops\r\ncould be forwarded at very short notice from Malta to Pishin and\r\nPeshawar, with almost equal speed to that with which Russia can collect\r\ntroops in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nIf once opened, the trade of Central Asia, India, and China would find\r\nits way by this route, and open out Persian and Indian relations with\r\nEurope as much as the Suez Canal[103] did after its opening; Persia\r\nwould be considerably strengthened. It would also, together with the\r\nmilitary occupation of Karrack and Cyprus (if done properly), give a\r\nguarantee to both India and Persia against Russian attacks.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Scandarum to Bussorah is only seven hundred miles, and\r\nwould be safe against attacks, being protected by the double rivers, the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris, for most of its course. Its cost would be\r\nestimated at £9,000,000, which might easily be raised in the London\r\nmarket. Also if the Mudinia Aksu line be extended to Scandarum, _viâ_\r\nKiniah or the Scutari-Ismid line to Aleppo, through Angora, Kaisariyeh,\r\nand Abbiston, other beneficial effects may be produced. In the latter\r\ncase it amounts, and is practically similar, to an extension of the\r\nEastern Railway to the Persian Gulf, which starts from Paris, and passes\r\nVienna, Belgrade, Sophia, Adrianople, terminating at Constantinople. So\r\na direct land route could be obtained from Bussorah to Calais or\r\nRotterdam if a bridge was constructed over the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nAs I have already shown in chapter VIII., the construction of the\r\nEuphrates Railway would avoid a Franco-English conflict of interests in\r\nEgypt to a certain extent, and a dual control would be established; thus\r\na strong and effective alliance would ensue, caused by mutual interests,\r\nand England would be able thereby to withdraw her troops from Egypt, and\r\ndevote them to the defence of Asia Minor. Thus a firm alliance between\r\nEngland and Turkey would follow, and would prevent a Mahommedhan\r\nrebellion in India against England, the Sultan being looked upon as the\r\nMahommedhan Pope.\r\n\r\nEngland will also be able to call Indian troops to her assistance in\r\nAsia Minor. It will follow that as a larger number of troops and a\r\nbetter communication is obtained in Asia Minor, Austria would be quite\r\nwilling to ally herself with England, instead of refusing, as she had\r\ndone twice before, the English power at sea being only of little use.\r\nEngland and Austria therefore can not only jointly support Turkey, but\r\nalso England can “come to the assistance of Austria in Europe, and\r\nAustria make common cause with England in the event of Turkey being\r\nattacked in Asia Minor.”\r\n\r\nHaving a French, Austrian, and Turkish alliance, England can send her\r\nhome troops both to India and Asia Minor by the Eastern Railway in a\r\nvery short space of time, and can strengthen both countries and also\r\nhelp in the Balkans if required, and a firm and lasting alliance would\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nWhy cannot Italy join this alliance? It is a matter of necessity and\r\nadvantage, both geographically and strategically, to do so, and if an\r\nalliance in Southern Europe could thus be made, the safety of the\r\nBalkans, Asia Minor, Persia, and Afghanistan might be assured, even if\r\nGermany joined Russia, and the lofty hopes of Russia would be dashed to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Lord Palmerston’s letter to Lord Clarendon, Feb. 17, 1857.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  John Morley’s “The Life of Richard Cobden,” vol. ii. p. 189.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  “In the year 1855 or 1856 his father’s influence succeeded in\r\n  procuring him a position in the suite of General Muravieff, who as\r\n  Governor-general of Eastern Siberia, had undertaken a more accurate\r\n  investigation of the Amoor territory, and was preparing for its\r\n  colonization.

Wealth, power, every\r\n  national advantage, flows into them, provided that where Nature has\r\n  done her utmost, man does not neglect to avail himself of her\r\n  beneficent assistance.\r\n\r\n  “Those countries are in the most favourable conditions which are\r\n  situated on the high road of commerce, and which offer to commerce the\r\n  safest ports and harbours, as well as the most profitable interchange\r\n  of commodities. Such countries, finding in the intercourse of foreign\r\n  trade illimitable resources, are enabled to take advantage of the\r\n  fertility of their soil; and in this way a home trade springs up\r\n  commensurate with the increase of mercantile traffic. It is by such\r\n  means that Tyre and Carthage, Constantinople, Venice, Genoa,\r\n  Amsterdam, Liverpool, and London attained to such great prosperity,\r\n  rising from the condition of poor hamlets to extensive and affluent\r\n  commercial cities, and exhibiting to surrounding nations the\r\n  astonishing spectacle of powerful states springing suddenly from\r\n  unwholesome swamps and marshes. Venice in particular was indebted for\r\n  her overwhelming grandeur to the geographical position which\r\n  constituted her for centuries the _entrepôt_ between Europe and the\r\n  East; and it was only when the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope\r\n  opened a ship passage to the latter that her prosperity gradually\r\n  declined. Notwithstanding, so great was her accumulation of wealth,\r\n  and consequent commercial influence, that she withstood for three\r\n  centuries the formidable competition thus created.\r\n\r\n  “There exists another city famous in history, although now fallen from\r\n  its pristine grandeur, so admirably situated as to excite the jealousy\r\n  of all the great European Powers, who combine to maintain in it a\r\n  government so far barbarous as to be incapable of taking advantage of\r\n  the great resources bestowed upon it by nature. The geographical\r\n  position of Constantinople is such as rendered her the queen of the\r\n  ancient world. Occupying, as she does, the central point between\r\n  Europe, Asia, and Africa, she could become the _entrepôt_ of the\r\n  commerce of all these countries, and obtain over them an immense\r\n  preponderance; for in politics, as in strategy, a central position\r\n  always commands the circumference. Situated between two seas, of\r\n  which, like two great lakes, she commands the entrance, she could shut\r\n  up in them, sheltered from the assaults of all other nations, the most\r\n  formidable fleets, by which she could exercise dominion in the\r\n  Mediterranean as well as in the Black Sea, thereby commanding the\r\n  entrance of the Danube, which opens the way to Germany, as well as the\r\n  sources of the Euphrates, which open the road to the Indies, dictating\r\n  her own terms to the commerce of Greece, France, Italy, Spain, and\r\n  Egypt. This is what the proud city of Constantine could be, and this\r\n  is what she is not, ‘because’ as Montesquieu says, ‘God permitted that\r\n  Turks should exist on earth, a people the most fit to possess\r\n  uselessly a great empire.’\r\n\r\n  “There exists in the New World a state as admirably situated as\r\n  Constantinople, and we must say, up to the present time, as uselessly\r\n  occupied; we allude to the state of Nicaragua. As Constantinople is\r\n  the centre of the ancient world, so is the town of Leon, or rather\r\n  Massaya, the centre of the new; and if the tongue of land which\r\n  separates its two lakes from the Pacific Ocean were cut through, she\r\n  would command by her central position the entire coast of North and\r\n  South America. Like Constantinople, Massaya is situated between two\r\n  extensive natural harbours, capable of giving shelter to the largest\r\n  fleets, safe from attack. The state of Nicaragua can become, better\r\n  than Constantinople, the necessary route for the great commerce of the\r\n  world, for it is for the United States the shortest road to China and\r\n  the East Indies, and for England and the rest of Europe to New\r\n  Holland, Polynesia, and the whole of the western coast of America. The\r\n  state of Nicaragua is, then, destined to attain to an extraordinary\r\n  degree of prosperity and grandeur; for that which renders its\r\n  political position more advantageous than that of Constantinople is,\r\n  that the great maritime powers of Europe would witness with pleasure,\r\n  and not with jealousy, its attainment of a station no less favourable\r\n  to its individual interests than to the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\n  “France, England, Holland, Russia, and the United States, have a great\r\n  commercial interest in the establishment of a communication between\r\n  the two oceans; but England has more than the other powers a political\r\n  interest in the execution of this project. England will see with\r\n  pleasure Central America become a flourishing and powerful state,\r\n  which will establish a balance of power by creating in Spanish America\r\n  a new centre of active enterprise, powerful enough to give rise to a\r\n  great feeling of nationality and to prevent, by backing Mexico, any\r\n  further encroachment from the north. England will witness with\r\n  satisfaction the opening of a route which will enable her to\r\n  communicate more speedily with Oregon, China, and her possessions in\r\n  New Holland. She will find, in a word, that the advancement of Central\r\n  America will renovate the declining commerce of Jamaica and the other\r\n  English island in the Antilles, the progressive decay of which will be\r\n  thereby stopped. It is a happy coincidence that the political and\r\n  commercial prosperity of the state of Nicaragua is closely connected\r\n  with the policy of that nation which has the greatest preponderance on\r\n  the sea.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  “The total length of the canal from sea to sea would be little short\r\n  of 200 miles, viz., 15½ miles from the Pacific to the lake, 56½ across\r\n  the lake, and 119 to the Atlantic; total, 191 miles; and the Lake of\r\n  Nicaragua is navigable for ships of the largest class down to the\r\n  mouth of the river San Juan” (C.

There is no reason\r\n  to doubt that care will be taken to ensure punctual payment in future\r\n  on this account until the entire extinction of this debt in 1895.”\r\n  Japan has never failed to pay her foreign debts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  There is also a Maritime Insurance Company.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Light-houses—fifty-seven in number and some of them are very powerful.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  The Samoan Convention declared the Samoan Islands to be neutral\r\n  territory.

Such as is one of these magnificent machines when\r\n  springing from inaction into a display of its strength, such is\r\n  England herself, while apparently passive and motionless she silently\r\n  causes power to be put forth on an adequate occasion” (Canning’s\r\n  speech at Plymouth, August, 1823).\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Holland’s “European Concert on the Eastern Question,” p. 206.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  “The growth of intimate relations between England and that country\r\n  France ... was manifestly viewed by him with jealous distrust,\r\n  calculated as it was to affect most seriously any designs which might\r\n  be entertained at St. Petersburg for enlarging Russian territory at\r\n  the expense of Turkey. To detach England from this alliance would\r\n  naturally be regarded by the Czar as a master-stroke of policy, and\r\n  the recent conduct of France in the Eastern Question may have seemed\r\n  to furnish an opening for making the attempt. If, however, as\r\n  currently believed at the time, one main object of his visit was to\r\n  ascertain for himself whether this was possible, he must soon have\r\n  been satisfied to the contrary by the very decided language with which\r\n  Sir Robert Peel received his suggestions as to the probably selfish\r\n  action of France, in the event of the affairs of Turkey coming to a\r\n  crisis” (Sir T.

We\r\n  could not therefore honestly continue to give an interpretation to the\r\n  Note, and ask the Turks again to sign it, when we knew that the\r\n  interpretation of the Emperor is entirely different” (Lord Sheridan’s\r\n  letter to Earl Russel, Sept. 22, 1853).\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  “I thought the Emperor Alexander had shown considerable moral courage\r\n  in making peace after the Crimean War, contrary to the general feeling\r\n  in Russia, and Prince D—— gave me the following curious details of\r\n  what occurred on that occasion, which he said had been related to him\r\n  by one of the Ministers present:—The Emperor called a Council of War\r\n  at St. Petersburg, which was composed of the following members: Prince\r\n  Dolgorouky, Minister of War; the Grand Duke Constantine, Minister of\r\n  Marine; M. de Broek, Minister of Finance; Count Blondoff, Prince\r\n  Moronzow, and, I think, M. Lapouchine, Minister of the Interior. The\r\n  Emperor first called on the Minister of War to report on the state of\r\n  the army, and he said the resources were exhausted, that more\r\n  recruiting was almost impossible, and that he did not see how the war\r\n  could be continued. The Emperor next addressed himself to his brother,\r\n  who, together with Count Blondoff, was in favour of continuing\r\n  hostilities at all risks. The Emperor asked what was the state of the\r\n  navy? The Grand Duke answered, ‘Sire, we have a fleet in the Baltic,\r\n  and another in the Black Sea.’ The Emperor acquiesced, but added,\r\n  ‘True; but those fleets have never left our harbours. Are they fit to\r\n  oppose the English and French fleets?’ The Grand Duke was obliged to\r\n  reply in the negative. ‘Then,’ said the Emperor, ‘it appears we have\r\n  no army and no fleet?’ The Grand Duke sighed, looked down, but made no\r\n  answer. The Emperor next addressed the Minister of Finance, and asked\r\n  what report he could give. He said, ‘Sire, we have just made one\r\n  disadvantageous loan, upon conditions imposed upon us at Hamburg, and\r\n  I believe another to be impossible.’ The Emperor then addressed the\r\n  Council, and said, ‘Gentlemen, it appears from what we have just heard\r\n  that we have neither army, navy, nor money; how, then, is it possible\r\n  for me to continue the war?’ Count Blondoff then stepped forward and\r\n  said, with deep emotion, ‘Sire, after the report we have just heard,\r\n  it is clear that your Majesty is forced to make peace, but at the same\r\n  time you must dismiss your incompetent Ministers, who have not known\r\n  how to serve either your father or yourself—dismiss us all.’ The\r\n  consternation of the other members of the Council at this outburst was\r\n  great, but peace was signed forthwith” (Lady Bloomfield’s “Court and\r\n  Diplomatic Life”).\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  A letter to Lord Clarendon, May 22, 1853.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  The strength of Lord Palmerston’s character and his determination in\r\n  matters of ready action is well illustrated through an incident\r\n  recorded by Baron Bunsen (“Memoirs of Bunsen”): “Bunsen and Palmerston\r\n  had elected to be rowed over to Portsmouth from Osborne, when guests\r\n  of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and, the weather being rough, the\r\n  Foreign Minister took the helm, demonstrating the connection between\r\n  steering the vessel of State, as Bunsen phrased it, and steering a\r\n  boat at sea—‘Oh, _one learns boating at Cambridge, even though one may\r\n  have learnt nothing better_,’ remarked Lord Palmerston; and guide the\r\n  craft safely to shore he certainly did. But when they landed, alas!\r\n  the train was gone.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Gladstone’s speech, May 8, 1854.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  “Napoleon’s object was clear: in the first place, to wrest from the\r\n  Emperor Nicholas the moral hegemony which he wielded on the Continent,\r\n  and then, after conquering Russia, to get his hands free to tear up\r\n  the treaties of 1815, restore to France her so-called natural\r\n  frontiers, and reconstruct the map of Europe in accordance with\r\n  Napoleonic ideas” (Count Vitzthum’s “St. Petersburg and London,” vol.\r\n  i. p. 73).\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Earl Russell’s “Recollections and Suggestions, 1813–1873,” p. 476.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  “No sooner had Napoleon learned that an English Cabinet Minister was\r\n  to go to Vienna than he sent thither also his own Minister of Foreign\r\n  Affairs, M. Drouyn de Lhuys, while Prince Gortschakoff, who had\r\n  already been designated as Nesselrode’s successor, represented Russia\r\n  at the Conference. The first two points—the cessation of the Russian\r\n  protectorate over Moldavia and Wallachia, and the regulation of the\r\n  navigation of the Danube in conformity with the resolutions of the\r\n  Congress of Vienna—presented little difficulty. On the other hand, a\r\n  lively word combat, and a not less lively interchange of despatches,\r\n  arose over the third point, which demanded the revision of the\r\n  Dardanelles Treaty of July 13, 1841, and the abrogation of Russian\r\n  supremacy in the Black Sea. The words, ‘mettre fin à la prépondérance\r\n  russe dans la Mer Noire,’ were of a very elastic nature, and capable\r\n  of various interpretations. The Western Powers, mindful of Europe,\r\n  demanded the neutralization of the Black Sea and a limitation of the\r\n  number of Russian and Turkish war ships. Gortschakoff declared that\r\n  Sebastopol was not yet taken, and probably never would be taken, and\r\n  that Russia must reject any attempt to limit her naval forces as a\r\n  humiliation unworthy of a Great Power. Austria then proposed a\r\n  compromise that Russia should pledge herself to maintain the _status\r\n  quo_ of 1853; and that each of the Western Powers should be entitled\r\n  to station two frigates in the Black Sea, in order to see that Russia\r\n  did not increase her fleet. At the same time Austria promised to\r\n  consider it as a _casus belli_ if Russia kept there a single ship of\r\n  war more than in 1853. M. Drouyn de Lhuys, who, in the interest of\r\n  exhausted France, was anxious to bring the war to an end, accepted\r\n  this proposed compromise, and induced Lord John Russell to do\r\n  likewise. Both were disavowed. Drouyn de Lhuys sent in his\r\n  resignation, and was succeeded at the Ministry on the Quai d’Orsay by\r\n  Walewski; but Lord John Russell, scorned alike by his friends and\r\n  foes, returned to London, and, in spite of all, remained Minister for\r\n  the present” (Count Vitzthum’s, “St. Petersburg and London.”)\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  In 1876 (September) Mr. Gladstone published his pamphlet entitled\r\n  “Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East.” It passed through\r\n  almost countless editions and created a great sensation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  “First, religious liberty, in the sense of religious equality, full\r\n  and entire; second, the abolition of tax-farming; third, the exclusive\r\n  application to Bosnia and Herzegovina of their own direct taxation;\r\n  fourth, the appointment of an executory Commission to carry these\r\n  reforms into effect, to be composed equally of Mahommedans and\r\n  Christians; fifth, the amelioration of the condition of the rural\r\n  population by some more satisfactory arrangement between the Christian\r\n  Rajahs and the Mahommedan Agas, or landowners” (The Duke of Argyll’s\r\n  “The Eastern Question,” vol. i. p. 161).\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  “Sir H. Elliot was directed to give a ‘general support’ to the\r\n  Andrassy Note. It will be seen that in the mode of giving this\r\n  ‘general support’ to the action of the European Powers, Her Majesty’s\r\n  Government here contrived to reduce the value of it to the lowest\r\n  possible amount, and expressly to negative the significance of it....\r\n  But more than this—it is distinctly implied that any such meaning, if\r\n  it were entertained, would be a violation of the Ninth Article of the\r\n  Treaty of Paris. The Turks were thus encouraged to claim under that\r\n  treaty a licence and immunity which it never was intended to afford.\r\n  It is evident, therefore, that the British Cabinet only joined the\r\n  other Powers, first, because it was impossible to deny the justice of\r\n  the demand made on Turkey; secondly, because it would be inconvenient\r\n  to stand alone against the united opinion of all the other Cabinets of\r\n  Europe; thirdly, because Turkey herself saw some advantage in\r\n  accepting the communication” (Ibid. vol. i. p. 166).\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Lord Derby said that “the Note now proposed was sure to lead to\r\n  farther diplomatic interference in the internal affairs of Turkey.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  “First, the provision of means sufficient to settle the refugees in\r\n  their homes; second, the distribution of these means by a mixed\r\n  Commission, with a Herzegovinian Christian as President; third, the\r\n  concentration of Turkish troops into certain places; fourth, the\r\n  retention of arms by the Christians; fifth, the Consuls or Delegates\r\n  of the Powers to have a watch over the application of the promised\r\n  reforms and repatriation of the people. The Memorandum farther\r\n  proceeded thus in its closing paragraph: If, however, the armistice\r\n  were to expire without the effort of the Powers being successful in\r\n  attaining the ends they have in view, the three Imperial Courts are of\r\n  opinion that it would become necessary to supplement their diplomatic\r\n  action by the sanction of an agreement, with a view to such\r\n  efficacious measures as might appear to be demanded in the interest of\r\n  general peace, to check the evil and prevent its development” (The\r\n  Duke of Argyll’s “The Eastern Question,” vol. i. p. 193).\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  “The objections of detail taken by the English Cabinet to the Berlin\r\n  Memorandum were at once met by Prince Bismarck by the declaration that\r\n  these points were entirely ‘open to discussion, that they might be\r\n  modified according to circumstances, and that he, for one, would\r\n  willingly entertain any improvement which Her Majesty’s Government\r\n  might have to propose.’... France implored Her Majesty’s Government to\r\n  reconsider its decision, and declared that persistence in it would, at\r\n  such a momentous crisis, be nothing short of a ‘public calamity.’ She\r\n  ‘could not conceal the apprehensions for the future to which this\r\n  refusal have given rise.’ Italy did the same. The position was, that\r\n  England objected to everything proposed by others, and had nothing to\r\n  propose herself. Continued trust in the Turks was her only suggestion”\r\n  (The Duke of Argyll’s “The Eastern Question,” vol. i. pp. 202, 203).\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  “At the first meeting of the Congress (June 13, 1878) Lord\r\n  Beaconsfield made his concerted objection to the advanced position of\r\n  the Russian troops at the gates of Constantinople.
