I particularly\r\ndesire to show what was his share in bringing about the economic advance\r\nof Germany during the golden age of the Empire's modern history, and to\r\nrelate how he--unsuccessfully, alas!--strove to prevent the proud\r\nstructure which he had helped to raise, from falling to ruin in the time\r\nof his country's distress. I believe that much that concerns the latter\r\naspect of his work will be new to most readers. In spite of all that has\r\nbeen said and written concerning the political activities which Ballin\r\ndisplayed (and is alleged to have displayed) both before and during the\r\nwar, their object--and, more important still, their intimate connexion\r\nwith his economic activities--is scarcely known. Eminently successful\r\nthough Ballin had been in creating an atmosphere of mutual understanding\r\nbetween the various nations in the economic sphere, his attempts to\r\nreconcile the contending ambitions of those same nations where politics\r\nwere concerned ended in failure. And yet it is impossible to understand\r\nhis failure in one respect without first understanding his success in\r\nthe other; indeed, the connexion between the two sides of his work forms\r\nthe key to the character of the man and to the historical significance\r\nof his achievements.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this volume may shed some new light on the causes of\r\nGermany's collapse; this idea, at any rate, was before my mind when I\r\ndecided upon publication. Frederick the Great somewhere remarked that,\r\nto the great loss of mankind, the experiences gained by one generation\r\nare always useless to the next, and that each generation is fated to\r\nmake its own mistakes. If this is true, it is nevertheless to be hoped\r\nthat Germany, considering the magnitude of the disaster that has\r\novertaken her, will not allow the spirit of resignation implied by this\r\nremark to determine her actions in the present case.\r\n\r\nIn thus submitting to the public the information contained in this book,\r\nI am carrying out the behest of the deceased, who asked me to collect\r\nhis papers, and to make whatever use I thought fit of them. Moreover,\r\nthe fact that I had the privilege of being his collaborator for more\r\nthan ten years gives me perhaps a special right to undertake this task.\r\n\r\nMy best thanks are due to Director A. Storm for supplying me with\r\nmaterial illustrative of Ballin's early career; to Chief Inspector Emil\r\nF. Kirchheim for assistance with the technical details, and to Professor\r\nFrancke, who was on intimate terms of friendship with Ballin during a\r\nnumber of years, for information concerning many matters relative to\r\nBallin's personal character.\r\n\r\nMy constant endeavour has been to describe persons and events _sine ira\r\net studio_, and to refrain from stating as a fact anything for which no\r\ndocumentary evidence is available.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n_October, 1921._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                             PAGE\r\n\r\n1.

Before the large modern harbour\r\nbasins of the city were built, practically all the vessels which\r\nfrequented the port of Hamburg took up their berths along the northern\r\nshore of the Elbe close to the western part of the town. A long road,\r\nflanked on one side by houses of ancient architecture, extended--and\r\nstill extends--parallel to this predecessor of the modern harbour.\r\nDuring its length the road goes under different names, and the house in\r\nwhich Ballin was born and brought up stood in that portion known as\r\nSteinhöft.\r\n\r\nA seaport growing in importance from year to year is always a scene of\r\nbusy life, and the early days which the boy Ballin spent in his father's\r\nhouse and its interesting surroundings near the river's edge left an\r\nindelible impression on his plastic mind.\r\n\r\nThose were the times when the private residence and the business\r\npremises of the merchant and of the shipping man were still under the\r\nsame roof; when a short walk of a few minutes enabled the shipowner to\r\nreach his vessel, and when the relations between him and the captain\r\nwere still dominated by that feeling of personal friendship and personal\r\ntrust the disappearance of which no man has ever more regretted than\r\nAlbert Ballin. Throughout his life he never failed to look upon as\r\nideal that era when every detail referring to the ship and to her\r\nmanagement was still a matter of personal concern to her owner. He\r\ntraced all his later successes back to the stimulating influence of\r\nthose times; and if it is remembered how enormous was then the capacity\r\nfor work, and how great the love of it for its own sake, it must be\r\nadmitted that this estimate was no exaggeration. True, it is beyond\r\ndoubt that the everyday surroundings in which his boyhood was spent, and\r\nthe impressions gained from them, powerfully influenced his imagination\r\nboth as boy and growing youth. It may, however, also be regarded as\r\ncertain that the element of heredity was largely instrumental in\r\nmoulding his character.\r\n\r\nBallin belonged to an old Jewish family, members of which--as is proved\r\nby ancient tombstones and other evidence--lived at Frankfort-on-Main\r\ncenturies ago. Later on we find traces of them in Paris, and still later\r\nin Central and North Germany, and in Denmark. Documents dating from the\r\nseventeenth century show that the Ballins at that time were already\r\namong the well-to-do and respected families of Hamburg and Altona. Some\r\nof the earliest members of the family that can be traced were\r\ndistinguished for their learning and for the high reputation they\r\nenjoyed among their co-religionists; others, in later times, were\r\nremarkable for their artistic gifts which secured for them the favour of\r\nseveral Kings of France. Those branches of the family which had settled\r\nin Germany and Denmark were prominent again for their learning and also\r\nfor their business-like qualities. The intelligence and the artistic\r\nimagination which characterized Albert Ballin may be said to be due to\r\nhereditary influences. His versatile mind, the infallible discernment he\r\nexercised in dealing with his fellow-men, his artistic tastes, and his\r\nhigh appreciation of what was beautiful--all these are qualities which\r\nmay furnish the key to his successes as a man of business. His sense of\r\nbeauty especially made him extremely fastidious in all that concerned\r\nhis personal surroundings, and was reflected in the children of his\r\nimagination, the large and beautifully appointed passenger steamers.\r\n\r\nBallin always disliked publicity. When the Literary Bureau of his\r\nCompany requested him to supply some personal information concerning\r\nhimself, he bluntly refused to do so. Hence there are but few\r\npublications available dealing with his life and work which may claim to\r\nbe called authentic. Nevertheless--or perhaps for that very\r\nreason--quite a number of legends have sprung up regarding his early\r\nyears. It is related, for instance, that he received a sound business\r\ntraining first in his father's business and later during his stay in\r\nEngland. The actual facts are anything but romantic. Being the youngest\r\nof seven brothers and sisters, he was treated with especial tenderness\r\nand affection by his mother, so much so, in fact, that he grew up rather\r\na delicate boy and was subject to all sorts of maladies and\r\nconstitutional weaknesses. He was educated, as was usual at that time,\r\nat one of the private day-schools of his native city. In those days,\r\nwhen Hamburg did not yet possess a university of her own, and when the\r\nfacilities which she provided for the intellectual needs of her citizens\r\nwere deplorably inadequate for the purpose, visitors from the other\r\nparts of Germany could never understand why that section of the\r\npopulation which appreciated the value of a complete course of higher\r\neducation--especially an education grounded on a classical\r\nfoundation--was so extremely small. The average Hamburg business man\r\ncertainly did not belong to that small section; and the result was that\r\na number of private schools sprang up which qualified their pupils for\r\nthe examination entitling them to one year's--instead of three\r\nyears'--military service, and provided them with a general education\r\nwhich--without any reflection on their principals--it can only be said\r\nwould not bear comparison with that, for instance, which was looked upon\r\nas essential by the members of the higher grades of the Prussian Civil\r\nService. Fortunately, the last few decades have brought about a great\r\nimprovement in this respect, just as they have revolutionized the\r\naverage citizen's appreciation of intellectual culture and refinement.\r\n\r\nAlbert Ballin did not stand out prominently for his achievements at\r\nschool, and he did not shine through his industry and application to his\r\nstudies. In later life he successfully made up for the deficiencies of\r\nhis school education by taking private lessons, especially in practical\r\nmathematics and English, in which language he was able to converse with\r\nremarkable fluency. His favourite pastime in his early years was music,\r\nand his performances on the 'cello, for instance, are said to have been\r\nquite excellent. None of his friends during his later years can furnish\r\nauthoritative evidence on this point, as at that time he no longer had\r\nthe leisure to devote himself to this hobby. Apart from music, he was a\r\ngreat lover of literature, especially of books on _belles lettres_,\r\nhistory, and politics. Thanks to his prodigious memory, he thus was able\r\nto accumulate vast stores of knowledge. During his extended travels on\r\nthe business of his Company he gained a first-hand knowledge of foreign\r\ncountries, and thus learned to understand the essential characteristics\r\nof foreign peoples as well as their customs and manners, which a mere\r\nstudy of books would never have given him. So he became indeed a man of\r\ntrue culture and refinement. He excelled as a speaker and as a writer;\r\nalthough when he occasionally helped his adopted daughter with her\r\nGerman composition, his work did not always meet with the approval of\r\nthe teacher, and was once even returned with the remark, \"newspaper\r\nGerman.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1874, at the age of seventeen, Ballin lost his father. The business,\r\nwhich was carried on under the firm of Morris and Co., was an Emigration\r\nAgency, and its work consisted in booking emigrants for the\r\ntransatlantic steamship lines on a commission basis. Office premises and\r\ndwelling accommodation were both--as already indicated--located in the\r\nsame building, so that a sharp distinction between business matters and\r\nhousehold affairs was often quite impossible, and the children acquired\r\npractical knowledge of everything connected with the business at an\r\nearly age. This was especially so in the case of young Albert, who loved\r\nto do his home lessons in the office rooms. History does not divulge\r\nwhether he did so because he was interested in the affairs of the\r\noffice, or whether he obtained there some valuable assistance. The whole\r\nprimitiveness of those days is illustrated by the following episode\r\nwhich Ballin once related to us in his own humorous way. The family\r\npossessed--a rare thing in our modern days--a treasure of a servant who,\r\napart from doing all the hard work, was the good genius of the home, and\r\nwho had grown old as the children grew up. \"Augusta\" had not yet read\r\nthe modern books and pamphlets on women's rights, and she was content to\r\ngo out once a year, when she spent the day with her people at Barmbeck,\r\na suburb of Hamburg. One day, when the young head of Morris and Co. was\r\ndiscussing some important business matters with some friends in his\r\nprivate office, the door was suddenly thrust open, and the \"treasure\"\r\nappeared on the scene and said: \"Adjüs ook Albert, ick gah hüt ut!\"\r\n(\"Good-bye, Albert, I am going out to-day!\") It was the occasion of her\r\nannual holiday.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Morris and Co., of which Ballin's father had been one of the\r\noriginal founders in 1852, had never been particularly successful up to\r\nthe time of his death. Albert, the youngest son, who was born on August\r\n15th, 1857, joined the business when his father died. He had then just\r\nfinished his studies at school. The one partner who had remained a\r\nmember of the firm after Ballin's death left in 1877, and in 1879 Albert\r\nBallin became a partner himself. The task of providing for his widowed\r\nmother and such of his brothers and sisters as were still dependent on\r\nhis help then devolved on him, and he succeeded in doing this in a very\r\nshort time. He applied himself to his work with the greatest diligence,\r\nand he became a shining example to the few assistants employed by the\r\nfirm. On the days of the departure of the steamers the work of the\r\noffice lasted until far into the night, as was usually the case in\r\nHamburg in former years. An incident which took place in those early\r\ndays proves that the work carried on by Morris and Co. met with the\r\napproval of their employers. One day the head of one of the foreign\r\nlines for which the firm was doing business paid a personal visit to\r\nHamburg to see what his agents were doing. On entering the office young\r\nAlbert received him. He said he wanted to see Mr. Ballin, and when the\r\nyouthful owner replied that he was Mr. Ballin the visitor answered: \"It\r\nis not you I want to see, young man, but the head of the firm.\" The\r\nmisunderstanding was soon cleared up, and when Ballin anxiously asked if\r\nthe visitor had come to complain about anything connected with the\r\nbusiness, the reply was given that such was by no means the case, and\r\nthat the conduct of the business was considered much more satisfactory\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at a proper understanding of the conditions ruling in Hamburg\r\nat the end of the 'seventies, it is necessary to remember that the\r\nshipping business was still in its infancy, and that it was far from\r\noccupying the prominent position which it gained in later years and\r\nwhich it has only lost again since the war. The present time, which also\r\nis characterized by the prevalence of foreign companies and\r\nforeign-owned tonnage in the shipping business of Hamburg, bears a\r\nstrong likeness to that period which lies now half a century back. The\r\n\"Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft,\" although only\r\nrunning a few services to North and Central America, was even then the\r\nmost important shipping company domiciled in Hamburg; but it counted for\r\nvery little as an international factor, especially as it had just passed\r\nthrough a fierce struggle against its competitor, the Adler Line, which\r\nhad greatly weakened it and had caused it to fall behind other lines\r\nwith regard to the status of its ships. Of the other Hamburg lines which\r\nbecame important in later times, some did not then exist at all, and\r\nothers were just passing through the most critical period of their\r\ninfancy. The competitors of the Packetfahrt in the emigrant traffic were\r\nthe North German Lloyd, of Bremen; the Holland-America Line, of\r\nRotterdam, and the Red Star Line, of Antwerp. Apart from the direct\r\ntraffic from Hamburg to New York, there was also the so-called indirect\r\nemigrant traffic _via_ England, which for the most part was in the hands\r\nof the British lines. The passengers booked by the agents of the latter\r\nwere first conveyed from Hamburg to a British port, and thence, by a\r\ndifferent boat, to the United States. It was the time before the\r\nindustrialization of Germany had commenced, when there was not\r\nsufficient employment going round for the country's increasing\r\npopulation. The result was that large numbers of the inhabitants had to\r\nemigrate to foreign countries. That period lasted until the 'nineties,\r\nby which time the growth of industries required the services of all who\r\ncould work. Simultaneously, however, with the decrease of emigration\r\nfrom Germany, that from Southern Europe, Austria-Hungary, and the\r\nSlavonic countries was assuming huge proportions, although the\r\nbeginnings of this latter were already quite noticeable in the\r\n'seventies and 'eighties. This foreign emigrant traffic was the mainstay\r\nof the business carried on by the emigration agencies of the type of\r\nMorris and Co., whereas the German emigrants formed the backbone of the\r\nbusiness on which the German steamship lines relied for their passenger\r\ntraffic. Either the companies themselves or their agencies were in\r\npossession of the necessary Government licences entitling them to carry\r\non the emigration business. The agencies of the foreign lines, on the\r\nother hand, either held no such licence at all, or only one which was\r\nrestricted to certain German federal states or Prussian provinces--such,\r\nfor instance, as Morris and Co. possessed for the two Mecklenburgs and\r\nfor Schleswig-Holstein. This circumstance naturally compelled them to\r\ntap foreign districts rather than parts of Germany; and since the German\r\nlines, in order to keep down their competition, refused to carry the\r\npassengers they had booked, they were obliged to work in conjunction\r\nwith foreign ones. They generally provided the berths which the\r\nsub-agencies required for their clientèle, and sometimes they would book\r\nberths on their own account, afterwards placing them at the disposal of\r\nthe agencies. They were the connecting link between the shipping\r\ncompanies and the emigrants, and the former had no dealings whatever\r\nwith the latter until these were on board their steamers. The Hamburg\r\nemigration agents had therefore also to provide accommodation for the\r\nintending emigrants during their stay in Hamburg and to find the means\r\nfor conveying them to the British port in question. A number of taverns\r\nand hostelries in the parts near the harbour catered specially for such\r\nemigrants, and the various agents found plenty of scope for a display of\r\ntheir respective business capacities. A talent for organization, for\r\ninstance, and skill in dealing with the emigrants, could be the means of\r\ngaining great successes.\r\n\r\nThis was the sphere in which the youthful Albert Ballin gave the first\r\nproofs of his abilities and intelligence. Within a few years of his\r\nentering the firm the latter acquired a prominent position in the\r\n\"indirect\" emigration service _via_ England, a position which brought\r\nits chief into personal contact with the firm of Richardson, Spence and\r\nCo., of Liverpool, who were the general representatives for Great\r\nBritain of the American Line (one of the lines to whose emigration\r\ntraffic Morris and Co. attended in Hamburg), and especially with the\r\nhead of that firm, Mr. Wilding. An intimate personal friendship sprang\r\nup between these two men which lasted a lifetime. These close relations\r\ngave him an excellent opportunity for studying the business methods of\r\nthe British shipping firms, and led to the establishment of valuable\r\npersonal intercourse with some other leading shipping people in England.\r\nThus it may be said that Ballin's connexions with England, strengthened\r\nas they were by several short visits to that country, were of great\r\npractical use to him and that, in a sense, they furnished him with such\r\nbusiness training as until then he had lacked.\r\n\r\nHow successfully the new chief of Morris and Co. operated the business\r\nmay be gauged from the fact that, a few years after his advent, the firm\r\nhad secured one-third of the volume of the \"indirect\" emigration traffic\r\n_via_ England. At that time, in the early 'eighties, a period of grave\r\neconomic depression in the United States was succeeded by a trade boom\r\nof considerable magnitude. Such a transition from bad business to good\r\nwas always preceded by the sale of a large number of \"pre-paids,\" i.e.\r\nsteerage tickets which were bought and paid for by people in the United\r\nStates and sent by them to those among their friends or relatives in\r\nEurope who, without possessing the necessary money, wished to emigrate\r\nto the States. A few months after the booking of these \"pre-paids\" a\r\nstrong current of emigration always set in, and the time just referred\r\nto proved to be no exception to the rule. The number of steerage\r\npassengers leaving Hamburg for New York increased from 25,000 in 1879 to\r\n69,000 in 1880, and 123,000 in 1881.\r\n\r\nIt was quite impossible for the biggest Hamburg shipping company--the\r\nPacketfahrt--to carry successfully this huge number of emigrants. And\r\neven if this had been possible, the Packetfahrt would not have\r\nundertaken it, because it intentionally ignored the stream of non-German\r\nemigrants. Besides, the Company had neglected for years to adapt its\r\nvessels to the needs of the times, and had allowed its competitors to\r\ngain so much that even the North German Lloyd, a much younger\r\nundertaking, had far outstripped it. The latter, under its eminent\r\nchairman, Mr. Lohmann, had not only outclassed the Packetfahrt by the\r\nestablishment of its service of fast steamers--\"Bremen-New York in 9\r\ndays\"--which was worked with admirable regularity and punctuality, but\r\nhad also increased the volume of its fleet to such an extent that, in\r\n1882, 47 of the 107 transatlantic steamers flying the German flag\r\nbelonged to this Company, whereas the Packetfahrt possessed 24 only. For\r\nall these reasons it would have been useless for Morris and Co. to\r\nsuggest to the Packetfahrt that they should secure for it a large\r\nincrease in its emigrant traffic; and even if they had tried to extend\r\ntheir influence by working in co-operation with the Packetfahrt, such an\r\nattempt would doubtless have provoked the liveliest opposition on the\r\npart of the firm of August Bolten, the owner of which was one of the\r\nfounders of the Packetfahrt, and which, because they were acting as\r\ngeneral agents for the North American cargo and passenger business,\r\nexercised a powerful influence over the management of the Packetfahrt.\r\nThe firm of August Bolten, moreover, had, like the line they\r\nrepresented, always consistently refused to have any dealings with the\r\nemigrant agencies.\r\n\r\nBallin, knowing that the next few years would lead to a considerable\r\nincrease in the emigrant traffic, therefore approached a newly\r\nestablished Hamburg shipping firm--which intended to run a cargo service\r\nfrom Hamburg to New York--with the proposal that it should also take up\r\nthe steerage business. His British friends, when they were informed of\r\nthis step, expressed the apprehension lest their own business with his\r\nfirm should suffer from it, but Ballin had no difficulty in allaying\r\ntheir fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CARR LINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new shipping line for which Morris and Co. contracted to act as\r\nGeneral Passenger Agents was the privately owned firm of Mr. Edward\r\nCarr. The agreement concluded between the two firms shows distinct\r\ntraces of Ballin's enterprising spirit and of the largeness of his\r\noutlook. Morris and Co. undertook to book for the two steamships of the\r\nCarr Line then building, viz. the _Australia_ and the _America_, as many\r\npassengers as they could carry, and guaranteed to pay the owners a\r\npassage price of 82 marks per head, all the necessary expenses and\r\ncommissions, including those connected with the dispatch of the\r\npassengers, to be paid by Morris and Co. The steerage rate charged by\r\nthe Packetfahrt at that time was 120 marks. It was agreed that, if this\r\nrate should be increased, a corresponding increase should be made in the\r\nrates of the Carr Line. The number of trips to be performed by each\r\nsteamer should be about eight or nine per annum. If a third boat were\r\nadded to the service, the agreement entered into should be extended so\r\nas to cover this boat as well. For every passenger short of the total\r\ncapacity of each steamer Morris and Co. were to pay a compensation of 20\r\nmarks, if no arrangements had been made for the accommodation of the\r\npassenger, and 35 marks in case such accommodation had been arranged. It\r\nwas expected that each boat would carry from 650 to 700 passengers. The\r\nactual number carried, however, turned out to be slightly less, and\r\namounted to 581 when the first steamer left Hamburg on June 7th, 1881.\r\nMorris and Co. also undertook to hand over to the Carr Line all the\r\nthrough cargo they could secure. From the very start the work done by\r\nBallin seems to have met with the unqualified approval of the Carr Line\r\npeople; because the latter waived their claim to the compensation due to\r\nthem for the sixty passengers short of the total number which were to be\r\ncarried on the first trip, as Morris and Co. could prove that these\r\npassengers had failed to arrive, although the firm had been advised from\r\nDenmark that they were to come. On how small a scale the firm's business\r\nwas conducted may be gauged from the circumstance that the whole staff\r\nconsisted of nine employees only, who were paid salaries aggregating\r\n20,302 marks.\r\n\r\nIn one essential feature the service of the new line differed from those\r\nof its old-established competitors. The _Australia_ and the _America_\r\nwere ordinary cargo boats, but, in addition to a moderate amount of\r\ncargo, they also carried steerage passengers. They thus had not much in\r\ncommon with the usual passenger steamers by which both cabin and\r\nsteerage passengers were carried. The advantage of the new type to the\r\nemigrants was that it gave them much more space than was at their\r\ndisposal on the older boats. Whereas on the cabin steamers they were\r\npractically confined to a very small part of the boat, the Carr Line\r\nsteamers made no restriction whatever as to their movements on board;\r\nall the available space, especially on deck, was thrown open to them.\r\nThis type was not entirely a novelty, the sailing vessels of the older\r\nperiod used for the emigrant traffic being run on similar lines. The\r\nadvantages accruing to the owners from their new type of steamers were\r\nobvious. The arrangements for the accommodation and provisioning of the\r\nemigrants, compared with what was needed in the case of cabin\r\npassengers, were of the simplest kind, and thus the cost price of the\r\nsteamers was considerably less than that of vessels of the usual type.\r\nThis also meant a saving in the wages bill, as it led to a reduction in\r\nthe number of hands on board; and since the speed of the new boats was\r\nalso less than that of the older ones, the working expenses were reduced\r\nin proportion. The financial results of the service, therefore, were\r\nbetter, in spite of the low rates charged to the steeragers, than those\r\nobtainable by running cabin steamers with steerage accommodation, and\r\nthan those obtainable by running cargo steamers without any passenger\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nThe new line soon made itself felt as a serious competitor to the\r\nPacketfahrt, especially so as by 1885 its fleet had increased from two\r\nto five steamers. The lower steerage rates charged by the Carr Line led\r\nto a general decrease of rates in the New York service, which was not\r\nconfined to the lines running their services from Hamburg. The passage\r\nprices charged from the various ports are naturally closely related to\r\neach other, because each port tries to attract as much traffic as\r\npossible to itself, and this can only be brought about by a carefully\r\nthought-out differentiation. The struggle between the various lines\r\ninvolved which had started in Hamburg quickly extended to other seaports\r\nand affected a great many lines in addition to those of Hamburg. The\r\nrate-cutting process began in May, 1882. In the following October the\r\nPacketfahrt and the Lloyd had reduced their rates to 90 and in June,\r\n1883, to 80 marks, whilst the British lines in February, 1884, charged\r\nso little as 30s. The Carr Line, of course, had to follow suit. It not\r\nonly did so, but in proportion reduced its own rates even more than the\r\nother lines. The rates were even lower in practice than they appeared to\r\nbe, owing to the constantly growing commissions payable to the agents.\r\nThe agents of the competing lines, by publishing controversial articles\r\nin the newspapers, soon took the general public into their confidence;\r\nand in order to prevent such publicity being given as to their internal\r\naffairs, the managements of the various steamship lines entered into\r\nsome sort of mutual contact. The worst result of the rate-slashing was\r\nthat the agreements which the older lines had concluded amongst\r\nthemselves for the maintenance of remunerative prices soon became\r\nunworkable. First those relating to the Westbound rates had to go down\r\nbefore the new competitor; and in 1883, when this competition had really\r\ncommenced to make itself appreciably felt, the Packetfahrt found itself\r\ncompelled to declare its withdrawal from the New York Continental\r\nConference by which the Eastbound rate had been fixed at $30 for the\r\npassage from New York to the Continent, a rate which was so high that\r\nthe Carr Line found it easy to go below it.\r\n\r\nThe Packetfahrt made great efforts to hold its own against the newcomer,\r\nbut, as the following figures show, its success was but slight. In 1883\r\nthe Packetfahrt carried 55,390 passengers on 76 voyages, against 16,471\r\npassengers carried on 29 voyages by the Carr Line, so that the traffic\r\nsecured by the latter amounted to about 30 per cent. of that of the\r\nformer. The figures for 1884 show that 58,388 passengers were carried by\r\nthe Packetfahrt on 86 voyages, against 13,466 steeragers on 30 voyages\r\nby the Carr Line. If the figures relative to the direct and the indirect\r\nemigrant traffic from Hamburg are studied, it will be seen that a\r\nconsiderable decrease had taken place in the volume of the latter kind\r\nwithin a very few years, thus leading to an improvement in the position\r\nof the German lines as compared with that of their British competitors.\r\nThese figures are as follows:\r\n\r\n                    _Number of Emigrants carried_\r\n         _Packetfahrt_    _Carr Line_    _via British ports_\r\n\r\n  1880       47,000            --               20,000\r\n  1881       68,000           4,000             47,600\r\n  1882       68,000          11,000             31,000\r\n  1883       55,000          16,000             13,000\r\n  1884       58,000          13,000             16,000\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Packetfahrt, in order to prevent French competition\r\nfrom becoming too dangerous on the Havre-New York route, had to reduce\r\nits rates from Havre, and a little later it had to do likewise with\r\nregard to the Eastbound freight rates and the steerage rates. The keen\r\ncompetition going on between the lines concerned had led to a lowering\r\nof the Eastbound rate to Hamburg from $30 to $18; and as the commission\r\npayable to the agents had gone up to $5, the net rate amounted to $13\r\nonly. At last the shareholders of the Packetfahrt became restless, and\r\nat the annual general meeting held in 1884 one of their representatives\r\nmoved that the Board of the Company should be asked to enter into an\r\nagreement with the competing firm of Edward Carr. The motion, however,\r\nwas lost; and the further proposal that a pool should be established\r\namong the Hamburg emigrant agents fared no better.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the rate-war, which continued for a long period, would\r\nconsiderably affect the prosperity of the Carr Line in common with the\r\nother shipping companies. This circumstance prompted the proposal of\r\nEdward Carr, when the discussions were renewed in the spring of 1885, to\r\ncarry them on upon a different basis altogether. He proposed, in fact,\r\nthat the Carr Line itself should be purchased by the Packetfahrt. In the\r\ncourse of the ensuing negotiations Albert Ballin, as the representative\r\nof Edward Carr, who was absent from Hamburg for a time, played a\r\nprominent part. The Packetfahrt, in the meantime, had received advices\r\nfrom its New York office to the effect that the latter had reconsidered\r\nits attitude towards the claims of the Carr Line, that it looked upon a\r\nsuccessful termination of the struggle against this Line as hopeless,\r\nand that it therefore recommended the granting of the differential rates\r\nwhich formed the obstacle to peace. Nevertheless, it was not until July,\r\n1885, that, at a conference held in Hamburg, an agreement was concluded\r\nby the Packetfahrt, the Lloyd, the Carr Line, the Dutch, Belgian, and\r\nFrench lines, and the representative of the British lines. All these\r\ncompanies bound themselves to raise their rates to 100 marks, except\r\nthat the Carr Line should be entitled to fix theirs at 90 marks. Thus\r\nthe latter had at length received the recognition of its claim to a\r\ndifferentiation, and of its right to exist side by side with the older\r\nCompany, although its steamers were not of an equal quality with those\r\nof the latter. An agreement was also concluded by which the rates of\r\ncommission due to the Hamburg emigrant agents were fixed, and at the\r\ncontinued negotiations with the other lines Albert Ballin, from that\r\ntime onward, in his capacity of representative of the Carr Line, was\r\nlooked upon as on an equal footing with the representatives of the other\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe principal subject of the discussions was the question of\r\neliminating, as far as possible, British influence from the emigrant\r\ntraffic _via_ Hamburg. The competition of the British was, naturally,\r\nvery detrimental to the business of all the Continental, but more\r\nespecially the German lines, because the interests of the respective\r\nsides were utterly at variance with each other. The firm foundations of\r\nthe business transacted by the British lines were laid in England, and\r\nthe Continental business was merely a source of additional profit; but\r\nto the German lines it was the mainstay of their existence, and to make\r\nit pay was of vital importance to them. The German lines, therefore,\r\ndid not rest until, as the result of the continued negotiations among\r\nthe Continental companies, it was agreed that the uniform rates just\r\nfixed should not apply to the traffic which was carried on by the two\r\nHamburg lines from that city. Towards the end of 1885 the first object\r\naimed at by this step was realized: the conclusion of an agreement\r\nbetween the two Hamburg lines and the representatives of the British\r\nlines settling the rates and the commissions; but apart from this, no\r\nchanges of fundamental importance were made in this business until after\r\nAlbert Ballin, under an agreement proposed by the Packetfahrt, had\r\nentered the service of the Packetfahrt, as head of their passenger\r\ndepartment. An important exception, however, was the amalgamation\r\nsuddenly announced in March, 1886, of the Carr Line and the Union Line,\r\nwhich latter company was operated by Rob. M. Sloman and Co., of Hamburg.\r\nThe fact of this amalgamation considerably weakened the position of the\r\nPacketfahrt in its dealings with the Carr Line, because it gave\r\nadditional strength to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe details of the five years' agreement between Ballin and the\r\nPacketfahrt were approved by the Board of Trustees of that Company about\r\nthe middle of May, 1886. It was stipulated that, in conformity with the\r\npool agreement concluded between the two lines on May 22nd, the\r\nPacketfahrt should appoint Mr. Albert Ballin sole and responsible head\r\nof its North American passenger department (Westbound as well as\r\nEastbound services); that his work should include the booking of\r\nsteeragers for the Union Company's steamers (which, in accordance with\r\nthe pool agreement, the Packetfahrt had taken over), that he should\r\nappoint and dismiss the clerks employed by his department; that he\r\nshould fix their salaries and commissions; that he should sign passage\r\nagreements on behalf of the Company, and that he should issue the\r\nnecessary instructions to the agents and officers of the Company. All\r\nletters and other documents were to be signed \"by proxy of the\r\nHamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft,\" and he was\r\nrequired annually to submit to the directors a draft estimate of the\r\nexpenses of his department. On how modest a scale the whole arrangement\r\nwas drawn up may be inferred from the figures given in the first year's\r\ndraft estimate, viz. Salaries, 35,000 marks; advertisements, 50,000\r\nmarks; posters and printed matter, 25,000 marks; travelling expenses,\r\n6,000 marks; postage and telegrams, 10,000 marks; extras and sundries,\r\n10,000 marks. Equally modest was the remuneration of the new head who\r\nwas to receive a fixed salary of 10,000 marks per annum, plus a\r\ncommission under the pool agreement, allowing the inference that the\r\ntotal annual income of the newly appointed head of the department would\r\nwork out at something like 60,000 marks, which goes to show that the\r\nCompany had a high opinion of his capacity for attracting traffic to its\r\nservices. The conclusion of this agreement meant that the Packetfahrt\r\nhenceforth took entire control of its passenger business--which, until\r\nthen, had been looked after by the firm of Aug. Bolten--and that a\r\npassenger department had to be specially created. Thus an important step\r\nforward was made which could only be undertaken by the firm because such\r\na well-qualified man as Ballin happened to be at their service just\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nIf the course of the negotiations between the Packetfahrt and the Carr\r\nLine had not already shown it, this agreement would prove without a\r\nshadow of doubt that the then head of Morris and Co. had, at the age of\r\ntwenty-nine, and after twelve years of practical work, gained the\r\npremier position in the emigrant business of his native city and also a\r\nleading one in the general European emigrant business which in itself is\r\none of the most important branches of the shipping trade. The\r\ncorrespondence between Edward Carr and Ballin furnishes no indication\r\nthat the latter himself had insisted upon his being taken over by the\r\nPacketfahrt or that he had worked with this object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHEAD OF THE PACKETFAHRT'S PASSENGER DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 31st, 1886, Albert Ballin first took part in a joint meeting of\r\nthe Board of Trustees and the Board of Directors of the Packetfahrt. On\r\nthis occasion two proposals were put forward by him: one, to provide new\r\npremises for the work connected with the booking of passengers at an\r\nannual rent of 5,000 marks; the other, to start a direct service from\r\nStettin to New York _via_ Gothenburg. This latter proposal was prompted\r\nby the desire to reduce the influence of the British lines competing for\r\nthe Hamburg business. Such a reduction could only be brought about if it\r\nwere proved to the British lines that their position was by no means\r\nunassailable. The Scandinavian emigrant business to the United States\r\nwhich for long had been a source of great profit to the British, lent\r\nitself admirably to such purposes. Ballin's proposal was agreed to by\r\nthe Company's management, with the result that in July, 1886, a pool\r\nagreement was concluded between the Packetfahrt (on behalf of a Stettin\r\nLine of steamers) and the Danish Thingvalla Line. Steamers now began to\r\ncall at Gothenburg and Christiansand on their voyages from Stettin to\r\nthe United States. The new line was known as the \"Scandia Line\"; and in\r\nlater years, when a similar object was aimed at, it was called into\r\nexistence once more. The aim was not to establish a new steamer service\r\nfor its own sake, but rather to create an object for compensation which,\r\nin the negotiations with the British lines, could be given up again in\r\nexchange for concessions on the part of the latter regarding the\r\nHamburg business. If this plan failed, Ballin had another one mapped\r\nout: he threatened to attack the British in their own country by\r\ncarrying steerage passengers either from Liverpool _via_ Havre, or from\r\nPlymouth _via_ Hamburg. People in England laughed at this idea.\r\n\"Surely,\" they said, \"no British emigrant will travel on a German\r\nvessel.\" The British lines replied to Ballin's threat by declaring that\r\nthey would again reduce to 30s. their rates from Hamburg to New York\r\n_via_ a British port. However, the negotiations which Ballin entered\r\ninto with them in England during the month of September, 1886, soon\r\ncleared the air, and led to the conclusion of an agreement towards the\r\nend of the year. The Packetfahrt promised to withdraw its Scandia Line,\r\nand the British lines, in return, agreed to raise their steerage rates\r\nfrom Hamburg to 85 marks gross, and those from Liverpool, Glasgow, and\r\nLondon to £2 10s. net. A clearing house which should be under the\r\nmanagement of a representative of the British lines, and which was also\r\nto include the business done by the Bremen agents of the latter, was to\r\nbe set up in Hamburg. This clearing house was kept on until other and\r\nmore far-reaching agreements with the British lines made its continued\r\nexistence superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements which Ballin made with the agents represented in the\r\nclearing house show his skill in his dealings with other people. The\r\nwhole agreement, especially the fixing of the terms governing the share\r\nto be assigned to the agents--which amounted to 55 per cent, of the\r\nHamburg business--was principally aimed at the realization of as high a\r\nrate as possible. This policy proved to be a great success. Another step\r\nforward was that the Packetfahrt now consented to accept passengers\r\nbooked by the agents, thus reversing their previous policy of ignoring\r\nthem altogether.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with the British lines also provided that the Union Line\r\nshould raise its rates to 90 marks, the Packetfahrt to 95 marks, and the\r\nLloyd those charged for its services to Baltimore and New York to 100\r\nand 110 marks respectively. Henceforward both competing groups were\r\nequally interested in obtaining as high a rate as possible.\r\n\r\nThe practical working of the agreement did not fail to give\r\nsatisfaction, and the Continental lines could, undisturbed by external\r\ninterference, put their own house in order. A few years later, in 1890,\r\nthe British lines complained that they did not succeed in getting the\r\npercentage of business to which they were entitled. Negotiations were\r\ncarried on at Liverpool, during which Ballin was present. He pointed out\r\nthat, considering the whole Continental position, the British lines\r\nwould be ill-advised to withdraw from the agreement, and he stated that\r\nhe would be prepared to guarantee them their share (33 per cent.) of the\r\nHamburg business. The outcome was that the British lines declared\r\nthemselves satisfied with these new stipulations. A few years later,\r\nwhen the British lines joined the Continental Pool, the Hamburg\r\nagreement ceased to be necessary, and in 1893 the clearing house was\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nThe new Emigration Law of 1887--due to the exertions of the North German\r\nLloyd and the Packetfahrt--strengthened the position of the lines\r\nrunning direct services from German ports. Another step forward was the\r\nincrease of the passage rates which was agreed upon after negotiations\r\nhad taken place at Antwerp and in England, and after the German, Dutch,\r\nand Belgian lines had had a conference at Cologne. Contact was also\r\nestablished with the chief French line concerned.\r\n\r\nThe improvement, however, was merely temporary. The termination of the\r\nstruggle for the Hamburg business did not mean that all the differences\r\nbetween all the transatlantic lines had been settled. On the contrary,\r\nall the parties concerned gradually realized that it would be necessary\r\nto institute quite different arrangements; something to ensure a fairer\r\ndistribution of the traffic and a greater consolidation of their common\r\ninterests. A proposal to gain these advantages by the establishment of a\r\npool was submitted by the representative of the Red Star Line at a\r\nconference held in the autumn of 1886, and a memorandum written by\r\nBallin, likewise dating from 1886, took up the same idea; but an\r\nagreement was not concluded until the close of 1891.\r\n\r\nThat, in spite of Ballin's advocacy, five years had to elapse before\r\nthis agreement became perfect is perhaps to some extent due to the fact\r\nthat Ballin--who at that time, after all, was only the head of the\r\nPassenger Department of his Company--could not always speak with its\r\nfull authority where his own personal views were concerned. Moreover,\r\nthe influence of his Company was by no means very considerable in those\r\nearly days. The only passenger boat of any importance which the Company\r\npossessed in the early 'eighties, before Ballin had entered its\r\nservices, was the _Hammonia_, and she was anything but a success. She\r\nwas inferior both as regards her efficiency and her equipment. At last,\r\nhowever, Ballin's desire to raise the prestige of the Company triumphed,\r\nand the building of several fast boats was definitely decided upon. In\r\naddition to a comparatively large number of passengers--especially those\r\nof the first cabin--they were to carry a moderate amount of cargo. In\r\nsize they were subject to the restrictions imposed upon them by the\r\nshortcomings of the technical knowledge of that time, and by the absence\r\nof the necessary improvements in the fairway of the lower Elbe. Speed,\r\nafter all, was the main consideration; and it was the struggle for the\r\nblue riband of the Atlantic which kept the attention of the travelling\r\npublic riveted on these boats.\r\n\r\nA statement giving details of the financial results obtained by the\r\nfirst four of the new fast steamers which were entered into the service\r\nof the Company between 1889 and 1891 showed that the earnings up to and\r\nincluding the year 1895 did not even cover the working expenses, and\r\nthat those up to 1899 were not sufficient to allow for an interest of 4\r\nper cent, on the average book values of the steamers. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that the first of these two periods included the\r\ndisastrous season of 1892-93, when Hamburg was visited by an epidemic of\r\ncholera. And a different light is shed on the matter also if we further\r\nremember that depreciation had been allowed for on a generous scale, no\r\nless than 50 per cent, of the cost price plus the expenditure incurred\r\nthrough an enlargement of the _Auguste Victoria_, the oldest of the\r\nboats, having been deducted on that account. The Packetfahrt, like all\r\nthe other German shipping companies, has always been very liberal in\r\nmaking ample provision for depreciation. When, therefore, these steamers\r\nwere sold again at the time of the Spanish-American and Russo-Japanese\r\nwars, a considerable profit was realized on the transactions which\r\nenabled the Company to replace them by a very high-grade type of vessel\r\n(the _Deutschland_, _Amerika_, and _Kaiserin Auguste Victoria_). It must\r\nbe admitted in this connexion that perhaps no shipowner has ever been\r\nmore favoured by fortune than Ballin where the sale of such difficult\r\nobjects as obsolete express steamers was concerned. The value which\r\nthese boats had in relation to the prestige of the Company was very\r\nconsiderable; for, as Ballin expressed it to me one day: \"The possession\r\nof the old express steamers of the Packetfahrt certainly proved to be\r\nsomething like a white elephant; but just consider how greatly they\r\nhave enhanced the prestige of the Company.\" They attracted thousands of\r\npassengers to the Line, and acted as feeders to its other services.\r\n\r\nThe orders for the first two of these steamers were given towards the\r\nclose of 1887 to the Vulkan yard, at Stettin, and to the firm of Laird\r\nrespectively, at a price of £210,000 each, and the boats were to be\r\ncompleted early in 1889. They were the first twin-screw steamers, and\r\nwere provided with the system of \"forced draught\" for the engines. This\r\nsystem had just been introduced in British yards, and Ballin's attention\r\nhad been drawn to it by his friend Wilding, who was always ready to give\r\nhim valuable advice on technical matters. In order to find the means for\r\nthe construction of these and of some other boats, the general meeting\r\nof the shareholders, held on October 6th, 1887, voted a capital increase\r\nof 5,000,000 marks and the issue of 6,250,000 marks of debentures.\r\nKnowing that an improvement of the services was the great need of the\r\ntime, Ballin, since the time of joining the Company, had done all he\r\ncould to make the latter a paying concern again, and in this he\r\nsucceeded. For the year 1886 a dividend of 5 per cent. was paid, and\r\nthus it became possible to sanction an increase of the joint-stock\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nFurther foundations for later successes were laid by the reform of the\r\norganization and of the technical services of the Company. His work in\r\nconnexion with the Carr Line had taught the youthful head of the\r\npassenger department that careful attention to the material comfort of\r\nthe steerage passengers could be of great benefit to the Company. He\r\ncontinued along lines such as these, and at his suggestion the steerage\r\naccommodation on two of the Packetfahrt's steamers was equipped with\r\nelectric light, and provided with some single berths as well. This\r\nlatter provision was extended still further during the succeeding year.\r\nIn addition to the fast steamers, some ordinary ones were also ordered\r\nto be built. In 1888 two steamers were ordered for the Company's West\r\nIndies service, and shortly afterwards eight units of the Union Line\r\nwere bought at a price of 5,200,000 marks. All these new orders and\r\npurchases of steamers led to the joint-stock capital being raised from\r\n20 to 30 million marks. Two more boats were laid down in the Stettin\r\nVulkan yard, and a third with the firm of Laird. The express steamer\r\nthen building at the Vulkan yard was named _Auguste Victoria_ in honour\r\nof the young Empress.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months of 1887 Ballin, together with Mr. Johannes\r\nWitt, one of the members of the Board of Trustees, went to New York in\r\norder to discuss with the agents a reorganization of the New York\r\nrepresentation, which was looked after by Edward Beck and Kunhardt. In\r\nconsequence of the negotiations which Ballin carried on to that end, the\r\nagents undertook to submit their business for the Company to the control\r\nof an officer specially appointed by the Packetfahrt. This small\r\nbeginning led, in later years, to the establishment in New York of the\r\nCompany's direct representation under its own management.\r\n\r\nWhen Ballin joined the Packetfahrt, he did not strictly confine his\r\nattention to matters connected with the passenger services. When, for\r\ninstance, the head of the freight department was prevented from\r\nattending a meeting called by the Board of Trustees, Ballin put forward\r\na proposal for raising the rates on certain cargo. It was therefore only\r\nbut fit acknowledgment of his many-sided talents, and recognition that\r\nhis energetic character had been the guiding spirit in the Company's\r\naffairs, that the Board of Trustees appointed Ballin in 1888 a member of\r\nthe Board of Directors after two years with the Packetfahrt. This\r\nappointment really filled a long-felt gap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nTHE POOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"pool\" may be defined in a variety of ways, but, generally\r\nspeaking, the root idea underlying its meaning is always the same, both\r\nin its application to business and to betting. A pool, in brief, is a\r\ncombination of a number of business concerns for their own mutual\r\ninterests, all partners having previously agreed upon certain principles\r\nas to the distribution of the common profits. In other words, it is a\r\ncommunity of interests concluded upon the basis of dividing the profits\r\nrealized in a certain ratio. I have been unable to discover when and\r\nwhere this kind of combination was first used in actual practice. Before\r\nthe transatlantic steamship companies did so, the big trunk lines of the\r\nUnited States railway system are said to have used it in connexion with\r\nthe westbound emigrant traffic, and possibly for other purposes also.\r\n\r\nWhen Ballin wrote his memorandum of February 5th, 1886, the steamship\r\nlines must already have been familiar with the meaning of the term, for\r\nthe memorandum refers to it as something well known. Ballin begins by\r\nstating that the \"Conference of the Northern European Lines\" might be\r\nlooked upon as having ceased to exist, seeing that two parties were\r\nrepresented on it whose claims were diametrically opposed to each other.\r\nWhereas the North German Lloyd insisted on the right to lower its rates,\r\nthe Red Star Line claimed that these rates should be raised, so that it\r\nmight obtain a better differential rate for itself. A reconciliation of\r\nthese mutually contradictory views, the memorandum went on to say,\r\nappeared to be impossible, unless all parties agreed upon an\r\nunderstanding which would radically alter the relations then existing\r\nbetween their respective interests; and a way leading out of the\r\n_impasse_ would be found by adopting the pooling system proposed by the\r\nrepresentative of the Red Star Line. If we take the number of steeragers\r\ncarried to New York from 1881 to 1885 by the six lines concerned as a\r\nbasis, the respective percentages of the total traffic are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                      _Percentage_\r\n\r\n  North German Lloyd                    33·45\r\n  North German Lloyd (Baltimore Line)   14·80\r\n  Packetfahrt                           27·00\r\n  Union Line                             5·53\r\n  Red Star Line                         12·26\r\n  Holland American Line                  6·96\r\n\r\nIt was, however, justly pointed out at a meeting of the Conference that\r\nthe amount of tonnage must also be taken into account in laying down the\r\nprinciples which were to govern the distribution of the profits. The\r\naverage figures of such tonnage employed by the six lines during the\r\nsame period were:\r\n\r\n                                    _Tons_     _Percentage_\r\n\r\n  North German Lloyd               275,520     33·91\r\n  North German Lloyd (Baltimore\r\n  Line)                             63,000      7·76\r\n  Packetfahrt                      199,500     24·55\r\n  Union Line                        42,840      5·27\r\n  Red Star Line                    149,600     18·41\r\n  Holland American Line             82,080     10·10\r\n                                   -------     -----\r\n  Total tonnage                    812,540\r\n\r\nThe average of both sets of percentage figures worked out as follows:\r\n\r\n                                        _Percentage_\r\n\r\n  North German Lloyd                      33·68\r\n  North German Lloyd (Baltimore Line)     11·28\r\n  Packetfahrt                             25·77-1/2\r\n  Union Line                               5·40\r\n  Red Star Line                           15·33-1/2\r\n  Holland American Line                    8·53\r\n\r\n\"It would be necessary,\" the memorandum continued, \"to calculate each\r\nCompany's share annually on the basis of the average figures obtained\r\nfor the five years immediately preceding, so that, for instance, the\r\ncalculation for 1887 would be based on the figures for the five years\r\nfrom 1882 to 1886; that for 1888 on those for the period from 1883 to\r\n1887, and so on. Uniform passage rates and uniform rates of commission\r\nwould have to be agreed upon. To those lines which, like the North\r\nGerman Lloyd, maintained a service which was run by fast steamers\r\nexclusively, would have to be conceded the right to charge in their\r\nseparate accounts passage money up to 10 marks in excess of the normal\r\nrates, seeing that their expenses were heavier than those of the other\r\nlines. Those Companies, however, claiming differential rates below the\r\ngeneral ones agreed upon would have to make up the difference\r\nthemselves, which was not to exceed the amount of 30 marks--i.e. they\r\nwould have to contribute to the common pool a sum equal to the general\r\nrate without deduction.\"\r\n\r\nThe two cardinal principles lying at the root of this proposal were (1)\r\nthe assigning to each line of a definite percentage of the total traffic\r\non the basis of the average figures ascertained for a definite period of\r\ntime, and (2) the possibility of further grading these percentages by\r\ntaking into account the amount of tonnage which each line placed at the\r\ndisposal of the joint undertaking. This latter provision--which was\r\nknown during the early stages of the movement as the tonnage clause--was\r\nintended to prevent any single line from stagnation, and to give scope\r\nto the spirit of enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe tonnage clause was not maintained for the whole time during which\r\nthe pool agreement was in force. It was afterwards abolished at the\r\ninstance of the North German Lloyd. This event led, in the long run, to\r\nthe last big crisis which the pool had to pass through by the notice of\r\nwithdrawal given by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie. When this Company\r\nproposed to considerably enlarge its steerage accommodation through the\r\naddition to its service of the three big boats of the _Imperator_ class,\r\nit demanded a corresponding increase of its percentage figure, and, when\r\nthis claim fell through owing to the opposition of the North German\r\nLloyd, it gave formal notice of its withdrawal from the pool.\r\nPrecautions taken to counteract this led to negotiations which had to be\r\ndiscontinued when the war broke out. Nevertheless, the pool, which was\r\nfirst proposed in 1886, and which came into existence in 1892, did a\r\ngreat deal of good. More than once, however, the agreement ceased to be\r\neffective for a time, and this was especially the case on the occasion\r\nof the struggle with the Cunard Line which followed upon the\r\nestablishment of the Morgan Trust in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the pool was Heinrich Peters, the former head of the\r\npassenger department of the Lloyd. The choice of Mr. Peters is probably\r\nnot unconnected with the fact that it was he who, at a moment when the\r\nnegotiations for establishing a pool had reached a critical stage,\r\nappeared on the scene with a clearly-defined proposal, so that he, with\r\njustice, has been described as \"the father of the pool.\" Shortly before\r\nhis death in the summer of 1921 Mr. Peters wrote to me concerning his\r\nproposal and the circumstances of its adoption:--\r\n\r\n\"The history of the events leading up to the creation of the 'North\r\nAtlantic Steamship Lines Association,'\" he wrote in his letter, \"was not\r\nwithout complications. So much so that after the Conference at Cologne,\r\nat which it had been found impossible to come to an understanding, I\r\nwent to bed feeling very worried about the future. Shortly afterwards--I\r\ndon't know whether I was half awake or dreaming--the outline of the plan\r\nwhich was afterwards adopted stood out clearly before my mind's eye, its\r\nmain features being that each line should be granted a fixed percentage\r\nof the traffic on the basis of 'Moore's Statistics' (reports issued\r\nperiodically and showing the number of passengers landed in New York at\r\nregular intervals), and that the principle of compensation should be\r\napplied to adjust differences. When I was fully awake I found this plan\r\nso obviously right that, in order not to let it slip my memory, I jotted\r\ndown a note concerning it on my bedside table. Next morning, when\r\nBallin, Reuchlin (of the Holland American Line), Strasser (of the Red\r\nStar Line), and myself met again in the smoking-room of the Hotel du\r\nNord, I told them of my inspiration, and my plan was looked upon by them\r\nwith so much favour that Ballin said to me: 'Well now, Peters, you have\r\ndiscovered the philosopher's stone.' We then left, previously agreeing\r\namongst ourselves that we would think the matter over at our leisure,\r\nand that we should refrain from taking any steps leading to a conflict,\r\nat least for the time being. On my return to Bremen I went straight to\r\nLohmann (who was director general of the Lloyd at that time), but he\r\nimmediately threw a wet blanket over my enthusiasm. His objection was\r\nthat such an agreement would interfere with the progressive development\r\nof the Lloyd. A few days later a meeting of the Board of Trustees was\r\nheld at which I entered into the details of my proposal; but I am sorry\r\nto say that my oratorical gifts were not sufficient to defend it against\r\nthe objections that were raised, nor to prevent its rejection. I can\r\nhardly imagine what the representatives of the other lines must have\r\nfelt on hearing that it was the Lloyd itself which refused to accept the\r\nproposal which had been put forward by its own delegate, although the\r\nshare allotted to it was very generous. Thus the struggle went on for\r\nanother eighteen months, and it was not until January, 1892, that the\r\nprincipal lines concerned definitely concluded a pool agreement closely\r\nresembling the draft agreement I had originally proposed.\r\n\r\n\"The North Atlantic Steamship Lines Association was originally intended\r\nto remain in existence for the period of five years; but as it was\r\nrecognized by all parties that it was necessarily a step in the dark,\r\npeople had become so doubtful as to the wisdom of what they had done\r\nthat a clause was added to the effect that it could be cancelled after\r\nthe first six months provided a fortnight's notice was given by any\r\npartner to it. Nevertheless, the agreement successfully weathered a\r\nsevere crisis during the very first year of its existence, when the\r\ndisastrous cholera epidemic paralysed the Hamburg trade and shipping.\"\r\n\r\nThat this account is correct is confirmed by the minutes of the Cologne\r\nmeeting of February 6th, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe British lines definitely declined in March, 1892, to join the pool.\r\nThus the plan finally agreed upon in 1892 was subscribed to by the\r\nContinental lines alone, with the exception of the French line. In\r\ncontrast with previous proposals, the eastbound traffic was also to be\r\nparcelled out by the lines forming the pool.\r\n\r\nThis so-called North Atlantic Steamship Lines Association, the backbone\r\nof the later and greater pool, was built up on the following\r\npercentages:\r\n\r\n                                  _Westbound_       _Eastbound_\r\n                                  _traffic_ (_p.c._)  _traffic_ (_p.c._)\r\n\r\n  North German Lloyd                46·16           44·53\r\n  Packetfahrt (including the Union\r\n  Line)                             28·84           18·47\r\n  Red Star Line                     15·70           20·68\r\n  Holland American Line              9·30           16·32\r\n\r\nThese percentages were subject to the effect of the tonnage clause by\r\nwhich it was provided that 50 per cent. of the tonnage (expressed in\r\ngross registered tons) which any line should possess at any time in\r\nexcess of that possessed in 1890 should entitle such line to an increase\r\nof its percentage.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that Mr. Heinrich Peters was appointed\r\nsecretary of the pool. He, in compliance with the provision that the\r\nsecretariat should be domiciled at a \"neutral\" place, chose the small\r\nuniversity town of Jena for his residence. Thus this town, so famous in\r\nthe literary annals of Germany, became, for more than twenty years, the\r\ncentre of an international organization with which few, if any, other\r\nplaces could vie in importance, especially since the four lines which\r\nhad just concluded the original pool were joined, in course of time, by\r\nthe British lines, the French line, the Austrian line, and some\r\nScandinavian and Russian lines as well. Later on a special pool was set\r\nup for the Mediterranean business which, in addition to the German,\r\nBritish, and Austro-Hungarian lines, also comprised the French\r\nMediterranean, the Italian, and the Greek lines, as well as one Spanish\r\nline. The business of all these lines was centred at Jena.\r\n\r\nOf considerable importance to the smooth working of the pool was the\r\ncourt of arbitration attached to its organization. On account of the\r\nprominent position occupied by the German companies, German law was\r\nagreed to as binding for the decisions, and since at the time when the\r\npool was founded, Germany did not possess a uniform Code of Civil Law\r\nfor all parts of the Empire, the law ruling at Cologne was recognized to\r\nbe applicable to such purposes. Cologne was the city at which the\r\nestablishment of the pool was decided upon, and there all the important\r\nmeetings that became necessary in course of time were held. The chairman\r\nof the Cologne Association of Solicitors was nominated president of the\r\narbitration court, but later on this office devolved on President\r\nHansen, a member of the Supreme Court for the Hanseatic cities, who\r\nfilled his post for a long term of years--surely a proof of the\r\nconfidence and esteem with which he was honoured by all parties\r\nconcerned. Numerous awards issued by him, and still more numerous\r\nresolutions adopted at the many conferences, have supplemented the\r\noriginal pool agreement, thus forming the nucleus of a real code of\r\nlegislation affecting all matters dealing with the pool in which a large\r\nnumber of capable men drawn from the legal profession and from the world\r\nof business have collaborated.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of these regulations gradually developed into a science of\r\nits own, and each line had to possess one or more specialists who were\r\nexperts in these questions among the members of its staff. I am sure\r\nthey will unanimously agree that Albert Ballin surpassed them all in his\r\nknowledge of the intricate details. His wonderful memory enabled him,\r\nafter a lapse of more than twenty years, to recall every phase in the\r\nhistory of the pool, so that he acquired an unrivalled mastery in the\r\nconduct of pool conferences. This is abundantly borne out by the fact\r\nthat in 1908, when negotiations were started in London for the\r\nestablishment of a general pool--i.e. one comprising the whole of\r\nNorthern Europe, including Great Britain--Ballin, at the proposal of the\r\nBritish lines, was selected chairman of the conference which, after\r\nseveral critical phases had been passed through, led to a complete\r\nsuccess and an all-round understanding.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the normal development of business was greatly handicapped by\r\nthe terrible epidemic of cholera then raging in Hamburg. For a time the\r\nUnited States completely closed her doors to all emigrants from the\r\nContinent, and it was not until the following year that conditions\r\nbecame normal again. Nevertheless Ballin, in order to extend the various\r\nunderstandings between the Northern European lines, took an important\r\nstep, even before the close of 1892, by falling back upon a measure\r\nwhich he had already once employed in 1886. His object was to make the\r\nBritish lines more favourably inclined towards an understanding, and to\r\nthis end he attacked them once more in the Scandinavian business. The\r\nactual occasion which led to the conflict was that the British lines,\r\nowing to differences of opinion among themselves, had given notice of\r\nwithdrawal from the Hamburg agreement and from the Hamburg clearing\r\nhouse. This gave the Packetfahrt a free hand against its British\r\ncompetitors, and enabled it to carry as many as 2,500 Scandinavian\r\npassengers via Hamburg in 1892. The position of the Packetfahrt during\r\nthe ensuing rate war was considerably improved by the agreement which it\r\nhad concluded with the Hamburg agents of the British lines, who,\r\nalthough their principals had declared their withdrawal from the pool,\r\nundertook to maintain the rate which had been jointly agreed upon by\r\nboth parties.\r\n\r\nSome time had to elapse before this move had its desired effect on the\r\nBritish lines. Early in 1894 they declared themselves ready to come to\r\nan understanding with the Continental lines on condition that they were\r\ngranted 7 per cent. of the Continental traffic (in 1891 they had been\r\noffered 14 per cent.), and that the Packetfahrt was to discontinue its\r\nScandia Line.\r\n\r\nThis general readiness of the British companies, however, did not\r\npreclude the hostility of some of their number against any such\r\nagreement, and so the proposal fell through. The proposed understanding\r\ncame to grief owing to the refusal of the Cunard Line to join a\r\nContinental pool at the very moment when the negotiations with the\r\nBritish lines had, after a great deal of trouble, led to a preliminary\r\nunderstanding with them. A letter which Ballin received from an English\r\nfriend in January, 1894, shows how difficult it was to make the British\r\ncome round to the idea of a pool. In this letter it was said that the\r\ntime was not ripe then for successfully persuading the British lines to\r\njoin any pool or any other form of understanding which would necessitate\r\nagreement on a large number of details. All that could be expected to be\r\ndone at the time, the writer continued, was a rate agreement of the\r\nsimplest possible kind, and he thought that if such an understanding\r\nwere agreed to and loyally carried out, that would be an important step\r\nforward towards arriving at a general agreement of much wider scope.\r\n\r\nTo such vague agreements, however, the Continental lines objected on\r\nprinciple, and the opposition of the Cunard Line made it impossible to\r\nagree upon anything more definite. Thus the struggle was chiefly waged\r\nagainst this line. The Continental lines were assisted by the American\r\nLine, which had sailings from British ports, and with the management of\r\nwhich Ballin had been on very friendly terms ever since the time when\r\nhe, as the owner of the firm of Morris and Co., had worked for it. After\r\nthe conflict had been going on for several months, it terminated with a\r\nvictory of the Continental lines. Thus the road was at last clear for\r\nan attempt to make the whole North Atlantic business pay.\r\n\r\nThe first step in that direction was the conclusion, in 1896, of an\r\nagreement concerning the cabin business. The Packetfahrt's annual report\r\nfor that year states that the results obtained through the carrying of\r\ncabin passengers could only be described as exceedingly unfavourable,\r\nconsidering that the huge working expenses connected with that kind of\r\nbusiness had to be taken into account. Nevertheless, this traffic, which\r\nhad reached a total of more than 200,000 passengers during the preceding\r\nyear, could be made a source of great profit to the companies if they\r\ncould be persuaded to act in unison. The agreement then concluded was at\r\nfirst restricted to the fixing of the rates on a uniform scale.\r\n\r\nBoth these agreements--the one dealing with the steerage and the one\r\ndealing with the cabin business--were concluded, in 1895, for three\r\nyears in the first instance. In May, 1898, discussions were opened in\r\nLondon, at which Ballin presided, with a view to extending the period of\r\ntheir duration, and these proceedings, after a time, led to a successful\r\nconclusion, but in June, Ballin again presiding, the desired\r\nunderstanding was reached. A few weeks later an agreement concerning the\r\nsecond cabin rates was also arrived at, and towards the close of the\r\nyear negotiations were started with a view to the extension of the\r\nsteerage agreement. In 1899 the pool was extended to run for a further\r\nperiod of five years, under percentages:\r\n\r\n                       _Westbound_        _Eastbound_\r\n                       _traffic_ (_p.c._) _traffic_ (_p.c._)\r\n\r\n  North German Lloyd       44·14           41·53\r\n  Packetfahrt              30·71           26·47\r\n  Red Star Line            15·37           18·68\r\n  Holland American Line     9·78           13·32\r\n\r\nTo the Packetfahrt these new percentages meant a step forward, although\r\nthe omission of the tonnage clause was a decided hindrance to its\r\nfurther progress.\r\n\r\nThe next important event in the development of the relations between the\r\ntransatlantic lines was the establishment of the so-called Morgan Trust\r\nand the conclusion of a \"community of interest\" agreement between it and\r\nthe German lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MORGAN TRUST\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the transatlantic shipping business may be said to\r\nconsist of three great branches, viz. the cargo, the steerage, and the\r\ncabin business. The pool agreements that were concluded between the\r\ninterested companies covered only the cargo business and the steerage\r\ntraffic. The condition which alone makes it possible for the owners to\r\nwork the shipping business on remunerative lines is that all needless\r\nwaste of material must be strictly banned. The great advantage which was\r\nsecured by concluding the pool agreement was that it satisfied this\r\ncondition during the more than twenty years of its existence, to the\r\nmutual profit of the associated lines. Each company knew that the\r\naddition of new steamers to its fleet would only pay if part of a\r\ncarefully considered plan, and if, in course of time, such an increase\r\nof tonnage would give it a claim to an increase of the percentage of\r\ntraffic allotted to its services.\r\n\r\nMuch less satisfactory was the state of things with regard to the third\r\nbranch of the shipping business, viz. the cabin traffic. A regular\r\n\"cabin pool,\" with a _pro rata_ distribution of the traffic, was never\r\nestablished, although the idea had frequently been discussed. All that\r\nwas achieved was an agreement as to the fares charged by each company\r\nwhich were to be graded according to the quality of the boats it\r\nemployed in its services. Owing to the absence of any more far-reaching\r\nunderstandings, and to the competition between the various\r\ncompanies--each of which was constantly trying to outdo its competitors\r\nas regards the speed and comfort of its boats, in order to attract to\r\nits own services as many passengers as possible--the number of\r\nfirst-class boats increased out of all proportion to the actual\r\nrequirements, and frequent and regular services were maintained by each\r\nline throughout the year. There was hardly a day on which first-class\r\nsteamers did not enter upon voyages across the Atlantic from either\r\nside, and the result was that the boats were fully booked during the\r\nseason only, i.e. in the spring and early part of summer on their\r\nEast-bound, and in the latter part of summer and in the autumn on their\r\nWestbound, voyages. During the remaining months a number of berths were\r\nempty, and the fares obtainable were correspondingly unprofitable.\r\nBallin, in 1902, estimated the unnecessary expenditure to which the\r\ncompanies were put in any single year owing to this unbusinesslike state\r\nof affairs at not less then 50 million marks. The desire to do away with\r\nconditions such as these by extending the pool agreement so as to\r\ndevelop it into a community-of-interest agreement of comprehensive scope\r\nwas one of the two principal reasons leading to the formation of the\r\nMorgan Trust. The other reason was the wish to bring about a system of\r\nco-operation between the European and the American interests.\r\n\r\nThis desire was prompted by the recognition of the cardinal importance\r\nto the transatlantic shipping companies of the economic conditions\r\nruling in the United States. The cargo business depended very largely on\r\nthe importation of European goods into the United States, and on the\r\nexportation of American agricultural produce to Europe which varied from\r\nseason to season according to the size of the crop and to the consuming\r\ncapacity of Europe. The steerage business, of course, relied in the main\r\non the capacity of the United States for absorbing European immigrants,\r\nwhich capacity, though fluctuating, was practically unlimited. The\r\ndegree of prosperity of the cabin business, however, was determined by\r\nthe number of people who travelled from the States to Europe, either on\r\nbusiness, or on pleasure, or to recuperate their health at some European\r\nwatering-place, at the Riviera, etc. Social customs and the attractions\r\nwhich the Paris houses of fashion exercised on the American ladies also\r\nformed a considerable factor which had to be relied on for a prosperous\r\nseason. In the transatlantic shipping business, in fact, America is\r\npre-eminently the giving, and Europe the receiving, partner. Thus it was\r\nnatural to realize the advisability of entering into direct relations\r\nwith American business men.\r\n\r\nTo the Packetfahrt, and especially to Ballin, credit is due for having\r\nattempted before anybody else to give practical shape to this idea. His\r\nefforts in this direction date far back to the early years of his\r\nbusiness career. We possess evidence of this in the form of a letter\r\nwhich he wrote in 1891 to Mr. B. N. Baker, who was at the head of one of\r\nthe few big American shipping companies, the Atlantic Transport Company,\r\nthe headquarters of which were at Baltimore, and which ran its services\r\nchiefly to Great Britain. Mr. Baker was a personal friend of Ballin's.\r\nThe letter was written after some direct discussions had taken place\r\nbetween the two men, and its contents were as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I replied a few days ago officially to your valued favour of the\r\n     4th ult. to the effect that in consonance with your expressed\r\n     suggestion one of the Directors will proceed to New York in\r\n     September with a view to conferring with you about the matter at\r\n     issue.\r\n\r\n     \"Having in the meantime made it a point to go more fully into your\r\n     communication, I find that the opinions which I have been able to\r\n     form on your propositions meet your expressed views to a much\r\n     larger extent than you will probably have supposed. I have not yet\r\n     had an opportunity of talking the matter over with my colleagues,\r\n     and I therefore do not know how far they will be prepared to fall\r\n     in with my views. But in order to enable me to frame and bring\r\n     forward my ideas more forcibly here, I think it useful to write to\r\n     you this strictly confidential letter, requesting you to inform\r\n     me--if feasible by cable--what you think of the following project:\r\n\r\n     \"(1) You take charge of our New York Agency for the freight, and\r\n     also for the passage business, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) You engage those of our officials now attached to our New York\r\n     branch whom we may desire to retain in the business.\r\n\r\n     \"(3) You take over half of our Baltimore Line in the manner that\r\n     each party provides two suitable steamers fitted for the transport\r\n     of emigrants. To this end I propose you should purchase at their\r\n     cost price the two steamers which are in course of construction in\r\n     Hamburg at present for our Baltimore Line (320 feet length, 40 feet\r\n     beam, 27 feet moulded, steerage 8 feet, carrying 3,500 tons on 22\r\n     feet and about 450 steeragers, guaranteed to steam 11 knots, ready\r\n     in October this year), and we to provide two similar steamers for\r\n     this service. The earnings to be divided under a pool system.\r\n\r\n     \"(4) Your concern takes up one million dollars of our shares with\r\n     the obligation not to sell them so long as you control our American\r\n     business. I may remark that just at present our shares are\r\n     obtainable cheaply in consequence of the general depression\r\n     prevailing in the European money market, and further, owing to the\r\n     fact that only a small dividend is expected on account of the very\r\n     poor return freight ruling from North America. I think you would be\r\n     able to take the shares out of the market at an average of about 7\r\n     per cent. above par. We have paid in the last years since we\r\n     concluded the pool with the Union Line, viz. in 1886 4 per cent.,\r\n     1887 6 per cent., 1888 8-1/2 per cent., 1889 11 per cent., 1890 8\r\n     per cent. in the way of dividends, and during this time we wrote\r\n     off for depreciation and added to the reserve funds about 60 per\r\n     cent.\r\n\r\n     \"The position of our Company is an excellent one, our fleet\r\n     consisting of modern ships (average age only about five years), and\r\n     the book values of them being very low.\r\n\r\n     \"I should be obliged to you for thinking the matter over and\r\n     informing me--if possible by cable--if you would be prepared to\r\n     enter into negotiations on this basis. I myself start from the\r\n     assumption that it might be good policy for our Company to obtain\r\n     in the States a centre of interest and a position similar to that\r\n     held by the Red Star Line and the Inman Lines in view of their\r\n     connexion with the Pennsylvania Railroad, etc. It further strikes\r\n     me that if this project is brought into effect one of your concern\r\n     should become a member of our Board. I should thank you to return\r\n     me this letter which, as I think it right expressly to point out to\r\n     you, contains only what are purely my individual ideas.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that the writing of this letter was prompted not only\r\nby the Packetfahrt's desire to strengthen its position in the United\r\nStates, but also by its wish to obtain a foothold in Great Britain. This\r\nwould enable it to exercise greater pressure on the competing British\r\nlines, which--indirectly, at least--still did a considerable portion of\r\nthe Continental business. Ballin's suggestion did not lead to any\r\npractical result at the time, but was taken up again eight years later,\r\nin 1899, on the advice of Mr. (now Lord) Pirrie, of Messrs. Harland and\r\nWolff, of Belfast. Important interests, partly of a financial character,\r\nlinked his firm to British transatlantic shipping; and his special\r\nreason for taking up Ballin's proposal was to prevent an alliance\r\nbetween Mr. Baker's Atlantic Transport Company and the British Leyland\r\nLine, a scheme which was pushed forward from another quarter. He induced\r\nMr. Baker to come to Europe so that the matter might be discussed\r\ndirectly. The attractiveness of the idea to Ballin was still further\r\nenhanced by the circumstance that the Atlantic Transport Line also\r\ncontrolled the National Line which maintained a service between New\r\nYork and London, and was, indeed, the decisive factor on the New\r\nYork-London route. Ballin, accordingly, after obtaining permission from\r\nthe Board of Trustees, went to London, where he met Mr. Baker and Mr.\r\nPirrie.\r\n\r\nIt soon became clear, however, that the Board of Trustees did not wish\r\nto sanction such far-reaching changes. When Ballin cabled the details of\r\nthe scheme to Hamburg, it was seen that 25 million marks--half the\r\namount in shares of the Packetfahrt--would be needed to carry it\r\nthrough. Thus the discussions had to be broken off; but the attitude\r\nwhich the Board had taken up was very much resented by Ballin.\r\nSubsequent negotiations which were entered into in the early part of\r\n1900 in Hamburg at the suggestion of Mr. Baker also failed to secure\r\nagreement, and shortly afterwards the American company was bought up by\r\nthe Leyland Line.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a movement was being set on foot in the United States\r\nwhich aimed at a strengthening of the American mercantile marine by\r\nmeans of Government subsidies. This circumstance suggested to Mr. Baker\r\nthe possibility of setting up an American shipping concern consisting of\r\nthe combined Leyland and Atlantic Transport Company lines together with\r\nthe British White Star Line, which was to profit by the expected\r\nlegislation concerning shipping subsidies. Neither the latter idea,\r\nhowever, nor Mr. Baker's project assumed practical shape; but the\r\nAtlantic Transport-Leyland concern was enlarged by the addition of a\r\nnumber of other British lines, viz. the National Line, the\r\nWilson-Furness-Leyland Line, and the West Indian and Pacific Line, all\r\nof which were managed by the owner of the Leyland Line, Mr. Ellerman,\r\nthe well-known British shipping man of German descent. The tonnage\r\nrepresented by these combined interests amounted to half a million tons,\r\nand the new combine was looked upon as an undesirable competitor, by\r\nboth the Packetfahrt and the British lines. The dissatisfaction felt by\r\nthe latter showed itself, among other things, in their refusal to come\r\nto any mutual understanding regarding the passenger business. In the\r\nend, Mr. Baker himself was so little pleased with the way things turned\r\nout in practice that he severed his connexion with the other lines\r\nshortly afterwards, and once more the question became urgent whether it\r\nwould be advisable for the Packetfahrt--either alone, or in conjunction\r\nwith the White Star Line and the firm of Messrs. Harland and Wolff--to\r\npurchase the Atlantic Transport Line.\r\n\r\nThat was the time when Mr. Pierpont Morgan's endeavours to create the\r\ncombine, which has since then become known as the Morgan Trust, first\r\nattracted public attention. Ballin's notes give an exhaustive\r\ndescription of the course of the negotiations which lasted nearly\r\neighteen months and were entered into in order to take precautions\r\nagainst the danger threatening from America, whilst at the same time\r\nthey aimed at some understanding with Mr. Morgan, because the\r\nopportunity thus presented of setting up an all-embracing organization\r\npromoting the interests of all the transatlantic steamship concerns\r\nseemed too good to be lost. Ballin's notes for August, 1901, contain the\r\nfollowing entry:\r\n\r\n\"The grave economic depression from which Germany is suffering is\r\nassuming a more dangerous character every day. It is now spreading to\r\nother countries as well, and only the United States seem to have escaped\r\nso far. In addition to our other misfortunes, there is the\r\nunsatisfactory maize-crop in the States which, together with the other\r\nfactors, has demoralized the whole freight business within an\r\nincredibly short space of time. For a concern of the huge size of our\r\nown such a situation is fraught with the greatest danger, and our\r\nposition is made still worse by another circumstance. In the States, a\r\ncountry whose natural resources are wellnigh inexhaustible, and whose\r\nenterprising population has immensely increased its wealth, the creation\r\nof trusts is an event of everyday occurrence. The banker, Pierpont\r\nMorgan--a man of whom it is said that he combines the possession of an\r\nenormous fortune with an intelligence which is simply astounding--has\r\nalready created the Steel Trust, the biggest combination the world has\r\never seen, and he has now set about to lay the foundations for an\r\nAmerican mercantile marine.\"\r\n\r\nA short report on the position then existing which Ballin made for\r\nPrince Henckell-Donnersmarck, who had himself called into being some big\r\nindustrial combinations, is of interest even now, although the situation\r\nhas entirely changed. But if we want to understand the position as it\r\nthen was we must try to appreciate the views held at that time, and this\r\nthe report helps us to do. Ballin had been referred to Prince\r\nHenckell-Donnersmarck by the Kaiser, who had a high opinion of the\r\nlatter's business abilities, and who had watched with lively interest\r\nthe American shipping projects from the start, because he anticipated\r\nthat they would produce an adverse effect on the future development of\r\nthe German shipping companies. The report is given below:--\r\n\r\n     \"In 1830 about 90 per cent. of the United States sea-borne trade\r\n     was still carried by vessels flying the American flag. By 1862 this\r\n     percentage had gone down to 50 per cent., and it has shown a\r\n     constant decrease ever since. In 1880 it had dwindled down to 16\r\n     per cent., and in 1890 to as low a figure as 9 per cent. During\r\n     recent years this falling off, which is a corollary of the customs\r\n     policy pursued by the United States, has given rise to a number of\r\n     legislative measures intended to promote the interests of American\r\n     shipping by the granting of Government subsidies. No practical\r\n     steps of importance, however, have been taken so far; all that has\r\n     been done is that subsidies have been granted to run a North\r\n     Atlantic mail service maintained by means of four steamers, but no\r\n     success worth mentioning has been achieved until now.\r\n\r\n     \"Quite recently the well-known American banker, Mr. J. Pierpont\r\n     Morgan, conjointly with some other big American capitalists, has\r\n     taken an interest in the plan. The following facts have become\r\n     known so far in connexion with his efforts:\r\n\r\n     \"Morgan has acquired the Leyland Line, of Liverpool, which,\r\n     according to the latest register, owns a fleet of 54 vessels,\r\n     totalling 155,489 gross register tons. This purchase includes the\r\n     West India and Pacific Line, which was absorbed into the Leyland\r\n     Line as recently as a twelvemonth ago. The Mediterranean service\r\n     formerly carried on by the Leyland Line has not been acquired by\r\n     Morgan. He has, however, added the Atlantic Transport Company.\r\n     Morgan's evident intention is to form a big American shipping\r\n     trust, and I have received absolutely reliable information to the\r\n     effect that the American Line and the Red Star Line are also going\r\n     to join the combine. The shares of the two last-named lines are\r\n     already for the most part in American hands, and both companies are\r\n     being managed from New York. Both lines together own 23 steamers\r\n     representing 86,811 tons.\r\n\r\n     \"A correct estimate of the size of the undertaking can only be\r\n     formed if the steamers now building for the various companies, and\r\n     those that have been added to their fleets since the publication of\r\n     the register from which the above figures are taken, are also taken\r\n     into account. These vessels represent a total tonnage of about\r\n     200,000 tons, so that the new American concern would possess a\r\n     fleet representing 430,000 gross register tons. The corresponding\r\n     figures for the Hamburg-Amerika Linie and for the Lloyd, including\r\n     steamers building, are 650,000 and 600,000 tons respectively.\r\n\r\n     \"The proper method of rightly appreciating the importance of the\r\n     American coalition is to restrict the comparison, as far as the two\r\n     German companies are concerned, to the amount of tonnage which they\r\n     employ in their services to and from United States ports. If this\r\n     is borne in mind, we arrive at the following figures: German\r\n     lines--390,000 G.R.T.; American concern--about 430,000 G.R.T. These\r\n     figures show that, as regards the amount of tonnage employed, the\r\n     Morgan Trust is superior to the two German companies on the North\r\n     Atlantic route. It can also challenge comparison with the regular\r\n     British lines--grand total, 438,566 G.R.T.\r\n\r\n     \"In all the steps he has taken, Morgan, no doubt, has been guided\r\n     by his confidence in his ability to enforce the passing of a\r\n     Subsidy Act by Congress in favour of his undertaking. So long as he\r\n     does not succeed in these efforts of his he will, of course, be\r\n     obliged to operate the lines of which he has secured control under\r\n     foreign flags. Up to the present only four steamers of the American\r\n     Line, viz. the _New York_, _Philadelphia_, _St. Louis_, and _St.\r\n     Paul_, are flying the United States flag, whereas the remaining\r\n     vessels of the American Line, and those of the Leyland, the West\r\n     India and Pacific, the American Transport, the National, and the\r\n     Furness-Boston lines, are sailing under the British, and those of\r\n     the Red Star Line under the Belgian flag.\r\n\r\n     \"The organization which Mr. Morgan either has created, or is\r\n     creating, is not in itself a danger to the two German shipping\r\n     companies; neither can it be said that the Government\r\n     subsidies--provided they do not exceed an amount that is justified\r\n     by the conditions actually existing--are in themselves detrimental\r\n     to the German interests. The real danger, however, threatens from\r\n     the amalgamation of the American railway interests with those of\r\n     American shipping.\r\n\r\n     \"It is no secret that Morgan is pursuing his far-reaching plans as\r\n     the head of a syndicate which comprises a number of the most\r\n     important and most enterprising business men in the United States,\r\n     and that the railway interests are particularly well represented in\r\n     it. Morgan himself, during his stay in London a few months ago,\r\n     stated to some British shipping men that, according to his\r\n     estimates, nearly 70 per cent. of the goods which are shipped to\r\n     Europe from the North Atlantic ports are carried to the latter by\r\n     the railroads on Through Bills of Lading, and that their further\r\n     transport is entrusted to foreign shipping companies. He and his\r\n     friends, Morgan added, did not see any reason why the railroad\r\n     companies should leave it to foreign-owned companies to carry those\r\n     American goods across the Atlantic. It would be much more logical\r\n     to bring about an amalgamation of the American railroad and\r\n     shipping interests for the purpose of securing the whole profits\r\n     for American capital.\r\n\r\n     \"This projected combination of the railroad and sea-borne traffic\r\n     is, as I have pointed out, a great source of danger to the foreign\r\n     shipping companies, as it will expose them to the possibility of\r\n     finding their supplies from the United States _hinterland_ cut off.\r\n     This latter traffic is indispensable to the remunerative working of\r\n     our North American services, and it is quite likely that Morgan's\r\n     statement that they amount to about 70 per cent. of the total\r\n     sea-borne traffic is essentially correct.\"\r\n\r\nThe negotiations which Ballin carried on in this connexion are described\r\nas follows in his notes:--\r\n\r\n     \"When I was in London in July (1901), I had an opportunity of\r\n     discussing this American business with Mr. Pirrie. Pirrie had\r\n     already informed me some time ago that he would like to talk to me\r\n     on this subject, but he had never indicated until then that Morgan\r\n     had actually instructed him to discuss matters with me. A second\r\n     meeting took place at which Ismay (the chairman of the White Star\r\n     Line) was present in addition to Pirrie and myself, and it was\r\n     agreed that Pirrie should go to New York and find out from Morgan\r\n     himself what were his plans regarding the White Star Line and the\r\n     Hamburg-Amerika Linie.\r\n\r\n     \"Shortly after Pirrie's return from the States I went to London to\r\n     talk things over with him. He had already sent me a wire to say\r\n     that he had also asked Mr. Wilding to take part in our meeting; and\r\n     this circumstance induced me to call on Mr. Wilding when I passed\r\n     through Southampton _en route_ for London. What he told me filled\r\n     me with as much concern as surprise. He informed me that the\r\n     syndicate intended to acquire the White Star Line, but that, owing\r\n     to my relations with the Kaiser, the acquisition of the\r\n     Hamburg-Amerika Linie was not contemplated. Morgan, he further told\r\n     me, was willing to work on the most friendly terms with us, as far\r\n     as this could be done without endangering the interests of the\r\n     syndicate; but the fact was that the biggest American railroad\r\n     companies had already approached the syndicate, and that they had\r\n     offered terms of co-operation which were practically identical with\r\n     a combination between themselves and the syndicate.\r\n\r\n     \"In the course of the discussions then proceeding between Pirrie,\r\n     Wilding, and myself the situation changed to our advantage, and I\r\n     was successful in seeing my own proposals accepted, the essence of\r\n     which was that, on the one hand, our independence should be\r\n     respected, that the nationality of our company should not be\r\n     interfered with, and that no American members should be added to\r\n     our Board of Trustees; whilst, on the other hand, a fairly close\r\n     contact was to be established between the two concerns, and\r\n     competition between them was to be eliminated.\"\r\n\r\nThe draft agreement, which was discussed at these meetings in London\r\n(and which was considerably altered later on), provided that it should\r\nrun for ten years, and that a mutual interchange of shares between the\r\ntwo concerns should be effected, the amount of shares thus exchanged to\r\nrepresent a value of 20 million marks (equivalent to 25 per cent. of the\r\njoint-stock capital of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie). Mutual participation\r\nwas provided for in case of any future increase in the capital of either\r\ncompany; but the American concern was prohibited from purchasing any\r\nadditional shares of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie. The voting rights for\r\nthe Hamburg shares should be assigned to Ballin for life, and those for\r\nthe American shares to Morgan on the same terms. Instead of actually\r\nparting with its shares, the Hamburg company was to have the option of\r\npaying their equivalent in steamers. The agreement emphasized that,\r\nwhilst recognizing the desirability of as far-reaching a financial\r\nparticipation as possible, Ballin did not believe that, with due regard\r\nto German public opinion and to the wishes of the Imperial Government,\r\nhe was justified in recommending an interchange of shares exceeding the\r\namount agreed upon. The American concern was prohibited from calling at\r\nany German ports, and the Hamburg company agreed not to run any services\r\nto such European ports as were served by the other party. A pool\r\nagreement covering the cabin business was entered into; and with respect\r\nto the steerage and cargo business it was agreed that the existing\r\nunderstandings should be maintained until they expired, and that\r\nafterwards a special understanding should be concluded between both\r\ncontracting parties.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Ballin's return to Hamburg the Board of Trustees\r\nunanimously expressed its agreement in principle with the proposals.\r\n\r\n\"For my own part,\" Ballin says in his notes on these matters, \"I\r\ndeclared that I could only regard the practical execution of these\r\nproposals as possible if they receive the unequivocal assent of the\r\nKaiser and of the Imperial Chancellor. Next evening I was surprised to\r\nreceive two telegrams, one from the Lord Chamberlain's office, and one\r\nfrom the Kaiser, commanding my presence on the following day for dinner\r\nat the Hubertusstock hunting lodge of the Kaiser, where I was invited to\r\nstay until the afternoon of the second day following. I left for Berlin\r\non the same evening, October 16th (1901); and, together with the\r\nChancellor, I continued my journey the following day to Eberswalde. At\r\nthat town a special carriage conveyed us to Hubertusstock, where we\r\narrived after a two-hours' drive, and where I was privileged to spend\r\ntwo unforgettable days in most intimate intercourse with the Kaiser. The\r\nChancellor had previously informed me that the Kaiser did not like the\r\nterms of the agreement, because Metternich had told him that the\r\nAmericans would have the right to acquire 20 million marks' worth of our\r\nshares. During an after-dinner walk with the Kaiser, on which we were\r\naccompanied by the Chancellor and the Kaiser's A.D.C., Captain v.\r\nGrumme, I explained the whole proposals in detail. I pointed out to the\r\nKaiser that whereas the British lines engaged in the North Atlantic\r\nbusiness were simply absorbed by the trust, the proposed agreement would\r\nleave the independence of the German lines intact. This made the Kaiser\r\ninquire what was to become of the North German Lloyd, and I had to\r\npromise that I would see to it that the Lloyd would not be exposed to\r\nany immediate danger arising out of our agreement, and that it would be\r\ngiven an opportunity of becoming a partner to it as well. The Kaiser\r\nthen wanted to see the actual text of the agreement as drafted in\r\nLondon. When I produced it from my pocket we entered the room adjacent\r\nto the entrance of the lodge, which happened to be the small bedroom of\r\nCaptain v. Grumme; and there a meeting, which lasted several hours, was\r\nheld, the Kaiser reading out aloud every article of the agreement, and\r\ndiscussing every single item. The Kaiser himself was sitting on Captain\r\nv. Grumme's bed; the Chancellor and myself occupied the only two chairs\r\navailable in the room, the Captain comfortably seating himself on a\r\ntable. The outcome of the proceedings was that the Kaiser declared\r\nhimself completely satisfied with the proposals, only commissioning me,\r\nas I have explained, to look after the interests of the North German\r\nLloyd.\r\n\r\n\"On the afternoon of the following day, after lunch, the Chancellor and\r\nI returned to Berlin, this giving me a chance of discussing with the\r\nformer--as I had previously done with the Kaiser--every question of\r\nimportance. On October 18th I arrived back in Hamburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with the North German Lloyd which Ballin had undertaken\r\nto enter upon proved to be very difficult, the Director General of that\r\ncompany, Dr. Wiegand, not sharing Ballin's views with respect to the\r\nAmerican danger and the significance of the American combination. After\r\nBallin, however, had explained the proposals in detail, the Lloyd people\r\naltered their previously held opinion, and in the subsequent London\r\ndiscussions, which were resumed in November, the President of the Lloyd,\r\nMr. Plate, also took part. Nevertheless, it was found impossible to\r\nagree definitely there and then, and a further discussion between the\r\ntwo directors general took place at Potsdam on November 13th, both of\r\nthem having been invited to dinner by the Kaiser, who was sitting\r\nbetween the two gentlemen at the table. Ballin's suggestion that he and\r\nDr. Wiegand should proceed to New York in order to ascertain whether the\r\nshipping companies and the American railroads had actually entered into\r\na combination, was heartily seconded by the Kaiser, and was agreed to by\r\nDr. Wiegand. The Lloyd people, however, were still afraid that the\r\nproposed understanding would jeopardize the independence of the German\r\nlines; but Ballin, by giving detailed explanations of the points\r\nconnected with the financial provisions, succeeded in removing these\r\nfears, and the Board of Trustees of the Lloyd expressed themselves\r\nsatisfied with these explanations. They insisted upon the omission of\r\nthe clauses dealing with the financial participation, but agreed to the\r\nproposals in every other respect.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for such mutual exchange of shares were thereupon\r\ndropped in the final drafting of the agreement, and were replaced by a\r\nmutual participation in the distribution of dividends, the American\r\nconcern guaranteeing the German lines a dividend of 6 per cent., and\r\nonly claiming a share in a dividend exceeding that figure. This change\r\nowed its origin to a proposal put forward by Mr. v. Hansemann, the\r\nDirector of the Disconto-Gesellschaft, who had taken an active interest\r\nin the development of the whole matter.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the negotiations the Lloyd made a further proposal by\r\nwhich it was intended to safeguard the German national character of the\r\ntwo great shipping companies. It was suggested that a\r\ncorporation--somewhat similar to the Preussische Seehandlung--should be\r\nset up by the Imperial Government with the assistance of some privately\r\nowned capital. This corporation should purchase such a part of the\r\nshares of each company as would defeat any attempts at destroying their\r\nnational character. Ballin, however, to whom any kind of Government\r\ninterference in shipping matters was anathema, would have nothing to do\r\nwith this plan, and thus it fell through.\r\n\r\nBallin thereupon having informed the Kaiser in Kiel on board the\r\nbattleship _Kaiser Wilhelm II_ regarding the progress of the\r\nnegotiations, a further meeting with the Lloyd people took place early\r\nin December, which led to a complete agreement among the two German\r\ncompanies as to the final proposals to be submitted to the American\r\ngroup; and shortly afterwards, at a meeting held at Cologne, agreement\r\nwas also secured with Mr. Pirrie. The final discussions took place in\r\nNew York early in February, Ballin and Mr. Tietgens, the chairman of the\r\nBoard of Directors, acting on behalf of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, and\r\nPresident Plate and Dr. Wiegand on that of the Lloyd. Meanwhile,\r\nMorgan's negotiations with the White Star Line and other British\r\ncompanies had also led to a successful termination. Concerning the New\r\nYork meetings we find an interesting entry in Ballin's diary:\r\n\r\n     \"In the afternoon of February 13th, 1902, Messrs. Griscom, Widener,\r\n     Wilding, and Battle, and two sons of Mr. Griscom met us in\r\n     conference. Various suggestions were put forward in the course of\r\n     the proceedings which necessitated further deliberations in private\r\n     between ourselves and the Bremen gentlemen, and it was agreed to\r\n     convene a second general meeting at the private office of Mr.\r\n     Griscom on the 15th floor of the Empire Building. This meeting was\r\n     held in the forenoon of the following day, and a complete agreement\r\n     was arrived at concerning the more important of the questions that\r\n     were still open. I took up the position that the combine would only\r\n     be able to make the utmost possible use of its power if we\r\n     succeeded in securing control of the Cunard and Holland American\r\n     Lines. I was glad to find that Mr. Morgan shared my view. He\r\n     authorized me to negotiate on his behalf with Director Van den\r\n     Toorn, the representative of the Holland American Line, and after a\r\n     series of meetings a preliminary agreement was reached giving\r\n     Morgan the option of purchasing 51 per cent. of the shares of the\r\n     Holland American Line. Morgan undertook to negotiate with the\r\n     Cunard Line through the intermediary of some British friends. It\r\n     has been settled that, if the control of the two companies in\r\n     question is secured to the combine, one half of it should be\r\n     exercised by the American group, and the other half should be\r\n     divided between the Lloyd and ourselves. This arrangement will\r\n     assure the German lines of a far-reaching influence on the future\r\n     development of affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"On the following Thursday the agreements, which were meanwhile\r\n     ready in print, were signed. We addressed a joint telegram to the\r\n     Kaiser, informing him of the definite conclusion of the agreement,\r\n     to which he sent me an exceedingly gracious reply. The Kaiser's\r\n     telegram was dispatched from Hubertusstock, and its text was as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'Ballin, Director General of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, New York.\r\n     Have received your joint message with sincere satisfaction. Am\r\n     especially pleased that it reached me in the same place where the\r\n     outlines gained form and substance in October last. You must be\r\n     grateful to St. Hubertus. He seems to know something about shipping\r\n     as well. In recognition of your untiring efforts and of the success\r\n     of your labours I confer upon you the Second Class of my Order of\r\n     the Red Eagle with the Crown. Remember me to Henry.--WILHELM I.R.'\r\n\r\n     \"Morgan gave a dinner in our honour at his private residence which\r\n     abounds in treasures of art of all descriptions, and the other\r\n     gentlemen also entertained us with lavish hospitality. Tietgens and\r\n     I returned the compliment by giving a dinner at the Holland House\r\n     which was of special interest because it was attended not only by\r\n     the partners of Morgan, but also by Mr. Jacob Schiff, of Messrs.\r\n     Kuhn, Loeb & Co., who had been Morgan's opponents in the conflict\r\n     concerning the Northern Pacific. During the following week the\r\n     Lloyd provided a big dinner on board the _Kronprinz Wilhelm_ for\r\n     about 200 invited guests.\r\n\r\n     \"Prince Henry of Prussia was one of the passengers of the\r\n     _Kronprinz Wilhelm_ which, owing to the inclemency of the weather,\r\n     arrived in New York one day behind her scheduled time. On the day\r\n     of her arrival--Sunday, February 23rd--I had dinner on board the\r\n     _Hohenzollern_. We also took part in a number of other celebrations\r\n     in honour of the Prince. Especially memorable and of extraordinary\r\n     sumptuousness was the lunch at which Mr. Morgan presided, and at\r\n     which one hundred captains of industry--leading American business\r\n     men from all parts of the States--were present. On the evening of\r\n     the same day the press dinner took place which 1,200 newspaper men\r\n     had arranged in honour of the Prince. Mr. Schiff introduced me to\r\n     Mr. Harriman, the chairman of the Union Pacific, with whom I\r\n     entered into discussions concerning our participation in the San\r\n     Francisco-Far East business.\"\r\n\r\nAt the request of the American group the publication of the agreement\r\nwas delayed for some time, because it was thought desirable to wait for\r\nthe final issue of the Congress debates on the Subsidies Bill. A report\r\nwhich Ballin, after some further discussion with Morgan and his London\r\nfriends had taken place, made for the German Embassy in London,\r\ndescribes the situation as it appeared in April, 1902. It runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"(1) Acquisition of the joint control of the Cunard Line by the two\r\n     German companies and the American syndicate. On this subject\r\n     discussions have taken place with Lord Inverclyde, the chairman of\r\n     the Cunard Line. Neither Lord Inverclyde nor any of the other\r\n     representatives of British shipping interests objected in any way\r\n     to the proposed transaction for reasons connected with the national\r\n     interest. He said, indeed, that he thought the syndicate should not\r\n     content itself with purchasing 51 per cent. of the shares, but that\r\n     it should rather absorb the whole company instead. The purchase\r\n     price he named appeared to me somewhat excessive; but he has\r\n     already hinted that he would be prepared to recommend to his\r\n     company to accept a lower offer, and it is most likely that the\r\n     negotiations will lead to a successful issue, unless the British\r\n     Government should pull itself together at the eleventh hour.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) Public announcement of the formation of the Combine. Whereas\r\n     until quite recently the American gentlemen maintained that it\r\n     would be advisable to wait for the conclusion of the negotiations\r\n     going on at Washington with respect to the proposed subsidy\r\n     legislation, Mr. Morgan now shares my view that it is not desirable\r\n     to do so any longer, but that it would be wiser to proceed without\r\n     any regard to the intentions of Washington. The combine,\r\n     therefore--unless unexpected obstacles should intervene--will make\r\n     its public appearance within a few weeks.\r\n\r\n     \"(3) The British Admiralty. An agreement exists between the British\r\n     Admiralty and the White Star Line conceding to the former the right\r\n     of pre-emption of the three express steamers _Oceanic, Teutonic,_\r\n     and _Majestic._ This agreement also provides that the White Star\r\n     Line, against an annual subsidy from the Government, must place\r\n     these boats at the disposal of the Admiralty in case of war. The\r\n     First Lord has now asked Mr. Ismay whether there is any truth in\r\n     the report that he wants to sell the White Star Line; and when he\r\n     was told that such was the case, he declared that, this being so,\r\n     he would be compelled to exercise his right of pre-emption.\r\n\r\n     \"It would be extremely awkward in the interests of the combine if\r\n     the three vessels had to be placed at the service of the Admiralty,\r\n     especially as it is probable that they would be employed in\r\n     competition with the combine. Therefore a compromise has been\r\n     effected in such a form that Mr. Morgan is to take over the\r\n     agreement on behalf of the combine for the three years it has still\r\n     to run. This means that the steamers will continue to fly the\r\n     British flag for the present, and that they must be placed at the\r\n     disposition of the Admiralty in case of war. The Admiralty\r\n     suggested an extension of the terms of the agreement for a further\r\n     period of three years; but it was content to withdraw its\r\n     suggestion when Mr. Morgan declined to accept it. The agreement\r\n     does not cover any of the other boats of the line which are the\r\n     biggest cargo steamers flying the Union Jack, and consequently no\r\n     obligations have been incurred with respect to these.\r\n\r\n     \"(4) Text of the public announcement. A memorandum is in course of\r\n     preparation fixing the text of the announcement by which the public\r\n     is to be made acquainted with the formation of the combine. In\r\n     compliance with the wishes emanating from prominent British\r\n     quarters, the whole transaction will be represented in the light of\r\n     a big Anglo-American 'community of interest' agreement; and the\r\n     fact that it virtually cedes to the United States the control of\r\n     the North Atlantic shipping business will be kept in the\r\n     background, as far as it is possible to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe first semi-official announcement dealing with the combine was\r\npublished on April 19th by the British Press, and at an Extraordinary\r\nGeneral Meeting of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie on May 28th, the public was\r\ngiven some carefully prepared information about the German-American\r\nagreement. At that meeting Dr. Diederich Hahn, the well-known chairman\r\nof the _Bund der Landwirte_ (Agrarian League), rose, to everybody's\r\nsurprise, to inquire if it was the case that the national interests, and\r\nespecially the agricultural interests of Germany, would be adversely\r\naffected by the agreement. The ensuing discussion showed Ballin at his\r\nbest. He allayed Dr. Hahn's fears lest the American influence in the\r\ncombination would be so strong as to eliminate the German influence\r\naltogether by convincing him that the whole agreement was built up on a\r\nbasis of parity, and that the German interests would not be jeopardized\r\nin any way. The argument that the close connexion established between\r\nthe trust and the American railroad companies would lead to Germany\r\nbeing flooded with American agricultural produce he parried by pointing\r\nout that the interests of the American railroads did not so much require\r\nan increased volume of exports, but rather of imports, because a great\r\ndisproportion existed between their eastbound and their westbound\r\ntraffic, the former by far exceeding the latter, so that a further\r\nincrease in the amount of goods carried from the western part of the\r\ncountry to the Atlantic seaports would only make matters worse from the\r\npoint of remunerative working of their lines.\r\n\r\nWhat Ballin thought of the system of Government subsidies in aid of\r\nshipping matters is concisely expressed by his remarks in a speech which\r\nhe made on the occasion of the trial trip of the s.s. _Blücher_, when he\r\nsaid: \"If it were announced to me to-day that the Government subsidies\r\nhad been stolen overnight, I should heave a sigh of relief, only\r\nthinking what a pity it was that it had not been done long ago.\"\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the news that some big British shipping companies had\r\nbeen purchased by the American concern caused a great deal of public\r\nexcitement. In Ballin's diary we find the following entry under date of\r\nJune 5th:\r\n\r\n     \"In England, in consequence of the national excitement, a very\r\n     awkward situation has arisen. Sir Alfred Jones and Sir Christopher\r\n     Furness know how to make use of this excitement as an opportunity\r\n     for shouldering the British nation with the burden which the\r\n     excessive tonnage owned by their companies represents to them in\r\n     these days of depression. King Edward has also evinced an\r\n     exceedingly keen interest in these matters of late, which goes to\r\n     show that what makes people in England feel most uncomfortable is\r\n     not the passing of the various shipping companies into American\r\n     hands, but the fact that the German companies have done so well\r\n     over the deal. Mr. Morgan has had an interview with some of the\r\n     British Cabinet ministers at which he declared his readiness to\r\n     give the Government additional facilities as regards the supply of\r\n     auxiliary cruisers. We are hopeful that such concessions will take\r\n     the wind out of the sails of those who wish to create a\r\n     counter-combination subsidized by grants-in-aid from the\r\n     Government.\"\r\n\r\nAn outcome of the German-American arrangements was that Morgan and his\r\nfriends were invited by the Kaiser to take part in the festivities\r\nconnected with the Kiel Week. The American gentlemen were treated with\r\nmarked attention by the Kaiser, and extended their visit so as to\r\ninclude Hamburg and Berlin as well.\r\n\r\nAt a conference of the transatlantic lines held in December, 1902, at\r\nCologne, Ballin put forward once more his suggestion that a cabin pool\r\nshould be established. The proposal, however, fell through owing to the\r\nopposition from the Cunard Line.\r\n\r\nThe depression in the freight business which had set in in 1901, and\r\nwhich was still very pronounced towards the close of 1902, seriously\r\naffected the prospects of the transatlantic shipping companies,\r\nespecially those combined in the Morgan Trust, who were the owners of a\r\nhuge amount of tonnage used in the cargo business, and whose sphere of\r\naction was restricted to the North Atlantic route. \"Experience now\r\nshows,\" Ballin wrote in his notes, \"that we were doing the right thing\r\nwhen we entered into the alliance with the Trust. If we had not done\r\nthis, the latter would doubtless have tried to invade the German market\r\nin order to keep its many idle ships going.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Cunard Line had concluded an agreement with the British\r\nGovernment by which the Government bound itself to advance to the\r\ncompany the funds for the building of its two mammoth express liners,\r\nthe _Mauretania_ and the _Lusitania_, while at the same time granting it\r\na subsidy sufficient to provide for the payment of the interest on and\r\nfor the redemption of the loan advanced by the Government for the\r\nbuilding of the vessels.\r\n\r\nFurther difficulties seemed to be ahead owing to the aggressive measures\r\nproposed by the Canadian Pacific Company, which was already advertising\r\na service from Antwerp to Canada. To ward off the danger threatening\r\nfrom this quarter, Ballin proceeded to New York to take up negotiations\r\nwith Sir Thomas Shaughnessy, the president of the Canadian Pacific. He\r\nwent there on behalf of all the Continental shipping companies\r\nconcerned, and the results he arrived at were so satisfactory to both\r\nparties that Ballin corresponded henceforth on terms of close personal\r\nfriendship with Sir Thomas, who was one of the leading experts on\r\nrailway matters anywhere. These friendly relations were very helpful to\r\nBallin afterwards when he was engaged in difficult negotiations with\r\nother representatives of Sir Thomas's company, and never failed to\r\nensure a successful understanding being arrived at.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of this trip to America Ballin had some interesting--or,\r\nas he puts it, \"rather exciting\"--discussions with Morgan and his\r\nfriends. He severely criticized the management of the affairs of the\r\nTrust, and tried to make Morgan understand that nothing short of a\r\nradical improvement--i.e. a change of the leading personages--would put\r\nmatters right. \"Morgan,\" he writes, \"finds it impossible to get the\r\nright men to take their places, and he held out to me the most alluring\r\nprospects if I myself should feel inclined to go to New York as\r\npresident of the Trust, even if only for a year or two; but I refused\r\nhis offer, chiefly on account of my relations with the Kaiser.\"\r\n\r\nBallin's suggestions, nevertheless, led to a change in the management of\r\nthe Trust. This was decided upon at meetings held in London, where\r\nBallin stayed for a time on his way back to Hamburg. Mr. Pirrie also\r\ntook part in these meetings.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the relations between the Cunard Line and the other\r\ntransatlantic shipping companies had become very critical. The Hungarian\r\nGovernment, for some time past, had shown a desire to derive a greater\r\nbenefit from the considerable emigrant traffic of the country--a desire\r\nwhich was shared by important private quarters as well. The idea was to\r\ndivert the stream of emigrants to Fiume--instead of allowing them to\r\ncross the national frontiers uncontrolled--and to carry them from that\r\nport to the United States by direct steamers. Ballin had repeatedly\r\nurged that the lines which were working together under the pool\r\nagreement should fall in with these wishes of the Hungarian Government;\r\nbut his proposals were not acted upon, mainly owing to the opposition of\r\nthe North German Lloyd, which company carried the biggest share of the\r\nHungarian emigrants.\r\n\r\nTo the great surprise of the pool lines it was announced in the early\r\npart of 1904 that the Hungarian Government was about to conclude an\r\nagreement with the Cunard Line--the only big transatlantic shipping\r\ncompany which had remained outside the Trust--by which it was provided\r\nthat the Cunard Line was to run fortnightly services from Fiume, and by\r\nwhich the Hungarian Government was to bind itself to prevent--by means\r\nof closing the frontiers or any other suitable methods--emigrants from\r\nchoosing any other routes leading out of the country. Such an agreement\r\nwould deprive the pool lines of the whole of their Hungarian emigrant\r\nbusiness. Discussions between Ballin and the representatives of the\r\nCunard Line only elicited the statement on the part of the latter that\r\nit had no power any longer to retrace its steps. An episode which took\r\nplace in the course of these discussions is of special interest now, as\r\nit enables us to understand why the amalgamation of the Cunard Line with\r\nthe Morgan Trust never took place.\r\n\r\nBallin asked Lord Inverclyde why the attitude of the Cunard Line had\r\nbeen so aggressive throughout. The reply was that the Morgan Trust, and\r\nnot the Cunard Line, was the aggressor, because Morgan's aim was to\r\ncrush it. When Ballin interposed that this had never been intended by\r\nthe Trust--that the Trust, indeed, had attempted to include the Cunard\r\nLine within the combination, that Lord Inverclyde himself had also made\r\na proposal towards that end, and that the project had only come to grief\r\non account of the strong feeling of British public opinion against\r\nit--Lord Inverclyde answered that, far from this being the case, the\r\nTrust had never replied to his proposal, and that he had not even\r\nreceived an acknowledgment of his last letter.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mr. Boas, the general representative of his company in\r\nNew York, in which he described the general situation, Ballin stated\r\nthat the statement of Lord Inverclyde was indeed quite correct.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian situation became still more complicated after the receipt\r\nof some information that reached Ballin from Vienna to the effect that\r\nthe Austrian Government intended to imitate the example set by the\r\nHungarian Government by running a service from Trieste. After prolonged\r\ndiscussions the Austrian Government also undertook not to grant an\r\nemigration licence to the Cunard Line so long as the struggle between\r\nthe two competing concerns was not settled.\r\n\r\nThereupon this struggle of the pool lines--both the Continental and the\r\nBritish ones--against the Cunard Line was started in real earnest, not\r\nonly for the British but also for the Scandinavian and the Fiume\r\nbusiness. After some time negotiations for an agreement were opened in\r\nLondon in July on the initiative and with the assistance of Mr. Balfour,\r\nwho was then President of the Board of Trade. These, however, led to no\r\nresult, and a basis for a compromise was not found until August, 1904,\r\nwhen renewed negotiations took place at Frankfort-On-Main. A definite\r\nunderstanding was reached towards the close of the same year, and then\r\nat last this struggle, which was really one of the indirect consequences\r\nof the establishment of the Morgan Trust, came to an end.\r\n\r\nLooked upon from a purely business point of view, the Morgan Trust--or,\r\nto call it by its real name, the \"International Mercantile Marine\r\nCompany,\" which in pool slang, was simply spoken of as the \"Immco\r\nLines\"--was doubtless a failure. Only the World War, yielding, as it\r\ndid, formerly unheard-of profits to the shipping business of the neutral\r\nand the Allied countries, brought about a financial improvement, but it\r\nis still too early to predict whether this improvement will be\r\npermanent. The reasons why the undertaking was bound to be\r\nunremunerative before the outbreak of the war are not far to seek, and\r\ninclude the initial failure of its promoters to secure the adhesion of\r\nthe Cunard Line--a failure which, as is shown by Ballin's notes, was to\r\na large extent due to the hesitating policy of the Hamburg company. To\r\nmake business as remunerative as possible was the very object for which\r\nthe Trust was formed, but the more economical working which was the\r\nmeans to reach this end could not be realized while such an essential\r\nfactor as the Cunard Line not only remained an outsider, but even became\r\na formidable competitor.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that the adhesion of the Cunard Line to the\r\nMorgan Trust--or, in other words, the formation of a combine including\r\nall the important transatlantic lines without exception--would have\r\nbrought about such a development of the pool idea as would have led to a\r\nmuch closer linking-up of the financial interests of the individual\r\npartners than could be achieved under a pool agreement. Under such a\r\n\"community of interest\" agreement, every inducement to needless\r\ncompetition could be eliminated, and replaced by a system of mutual\r\nparticipation in the net profits of each line. This was the ideal at\r\nwhich Ballin, taught by many years of experience, was aiming.\r\n\r\nOver and over again the pool lines had an opportunity of finding out\r\nthat it paid them better to come to a friendly understanding, even if it\r\nentailed a small sacrifice, than to put up a fight against a new\r\ncompetitor. Sometimes, indeed, an understanding was made desirable owing\r\nto political considerations. However, the number of participants\r\nultimately grew so large that Ballin sarcastically remarked: \"Sooner or\r\nlater the pool will have to learn how to get along without us,\" and he\r\nnever again abandoned his plan of having it replaced by closely-knit\r\ncommunity of interest agreements which would be worked under a\r\ncentralized management, and therefore produce much better results. In\r\nother branches of his activities--e.g. in his agreements with the other\r\nHamburg companies and in the one with the Booth Line, which was engaged\r\nin the service to Northern Brazil, he succeeded in developing the\r\nexisting understandings into actual community of interest agreements,\r\nand it seems that these have given all-round satisfaction. The\r\nnegotiations between himself and the North German Lloyd shortly before\r\nthe outbreak of the war were carried on with the same object.\r\n\r\nThroughout the endless vicissitudes in the history of the pool the\r\nformation of the Morgan Trust decidedly stands out as the most\r\ninteresting and most dramatic episode. At the present time the position\r\nof the German steamship companies in those days seems even more imposing\r\nthan it appeared to the contemporary observer. To-day we can hardly\r\nimagine that some big British lines should, one after the other, be\r\noffered for purchase first to some German, and then to the American\r\nconcerns. Such a thing was only possible because at that time British\r\nshipping enterprise was more interested in the employment of tramp\r\nsteamers than in the working of regular services, the shipowners\r\nbelieving that greater profits could be obtained by the former method.\r\nThe result was a noticeable lack of leading men fully qualified to speak\r\nwith authority on questions relating to the regular business, whereas in\r\nGermany such men were not wanting. The transatlantic business\r\nthreatened, in fact, to become more and more the prerogative of the\r\nGerman-American combination. To-day, of course, it is no longer possible\r\nto say with certainty whether the Cunard Line could have been induced to\r\njoin that combination, if the right moment had not been missed. The\r\ngreat danger with which British shipping was threatened at that time,\r\nand the great success which the German lines achieved, not only stirred\r\nBritish public opinion to its depths, but also acted as a powerful\r\nstimulus on the shipping firms themselves. This caused a pronounced\r\nrevival of regular line shipping, which went so far that tramp shipping\r\nbecame less and less important, and which ultimately led to a\r\nconcentration of the former within the framework of a few large\r\norganizations which exercise a correspondingly strong influence on\r\npresent-day British shipping in general. These organizations differ from\r\nthe big German companies by the circumstance that they represent close\r\nfinancial amalgamations and that they have not, like the German\r\ncompanies, grown up slowly and step for step with the expanding volume\r\nof transatlantic traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF THE HAMBURG-AMERIKA LINIE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal work which fell to Ballin's share during the period\r\nimmediately following his nomination in 1888 on the Board of his company\r\nwas that connected with the introduction of the fast steamers and the\r\nresulting expansion of the passenger business. Offices were established\r\nin Berlin, Dresden, and Frankfort-On-Main in 1890, and arrangements were\r\nmade with the Hamburg-South American S.S. Co., the German East Africa\r\nLine, and the Hansa Line--the latter running a service to Canada--by\r\nwhich these companies entrusted the management of their own passenger\r\nbusiness to the Packetfahrt. Thus, step by step, the passenger\r\ndepartment developed into an organization the importance of which grew\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the passenger business also necessitated an enlargement\r\nof the facilities for the dispatch of the Company's steamers. This work\r\nhad been effected until then at the northern bank of the main Elbe, but\r\nin 1888 it was transferred to the Amerika-Kai which was newly built at\r\nthe southern bank; and when the normal depth of the fairway of the Elbe\r\nwas no longer sufficient to enable the fast steamers of considerable\r\ndraught to come up to the city, it was decided to dispatch them from\r\nBrunshausen, a small place situated much lower down the Elbe. In the\r\nlong run, however, it proved very inconvenient to manage the passenger\r\ndispatch from there, and the construction of special port facilities at\r\nCuxhaven owned by the Company was taken in hand. The accommodation at\r\nthe Amerika-Kai, although it was enlarged as early as 1889, was soon\r\nfound to be inadequate, so that it was resolved to provide new\r\naccommodation at the Petersen-Kai, situated on the northern bank of the\r\nElbe, and this project was carried out in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe number of services run by the Company was augmented in those early\r\nyears by the establishment of a line to Baltimore and another to\r\nPhiladelphia. In 1889 a new line starting from New York was opened to\r\nVenezuelan and Colombian ports. The North Atlantic services were\r\nconsiderably enlarged in 1892, when the Company took over the Hansa\r\nLine.\r\n\r\nThe desire to find remunerative employment for the fast steamers during\r\nthe dead season of the North Atlantic passenger business prompted the\r\ndecision to enter these boats into a service from New York to the\r\nMediterranean during the winter months. The same desire, however, also\r\ngave rise to one of the most original ideas carried into practice\r\nthrough Ballin's enterprise, i.e. the institution of pleasure trips and\r\ntourist cruises. It may perhaps be of interest to point out in this\r\nconnexion that, about half a century earlier, another Hamburg shipping\r\nman had thought of specially fitting out a vessel for an extended cruise\r\nof that kind. I do not know whether this plan was carried out at the\r\ntime, and whether Ballin was indebted to his predecessor for the whole\r\nidea; in any case, the following advertisement which appeared in the\r\n_Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung,_ and which I reprint for curiosity's\r\nsake, was found among his papers.\r\n\r\n              \"AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TAKING PART IN A VOYAGE\r\n                            ROUND THE WORLD\r\n\r\n     \"The undersigned Hamburg shipowner proposes to equip one of his\r\n     large sailing vessels for a cruise round the world, to start this\r\n     summer, during which the passengers will be able to visit the\r\n     following cities and countries, viz. Lisbon, Madeira, Teneriffe,\r\n     Cap Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de la Plata, Falklands\r\n     Islands, Valparaiso, and all the intermediate ports of call on the\r\n     Pacific coast of South America as far as Guayaquil (for Quito), the\r\n     Marquesas Islands, Friendly Islands (Otaheite), and other island\r\n     groups in the Pacific, China (Choosan, Hongkong, Canton, Macao,\r\n     Whampoa), Manilla, Singapore, Ceylon, Île de France or Madagascar,\r\n     the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Ascension Island, the Azores,\r\n     and back to Hamburg.\r\n\r\n     \"The cruise is not intended for business purposes of any kind; but\r\n     the whole equipment and accommodation of the vessel, the time spent\r\n     at the various ports of call, and the details of the whole cruise,\r\n     are to be arranged with the sole object of promoting the safety,\r\n     the comfort, the entertainment, and the instruction of the\r\n     passengers.\r\n\r\n     \"Admission will be strictly confined to persons of unblemished\r\n     repute and of good education, those possessing a scientific\r\n     education receiving preference.\r\n\r\n     \"The members of the expedition may confidently look forward to a\r\n     pleasant and successful voyage.

M. SLOMAN,\r\n\r\n\"_Hamburg, January_, 1845. _Shipowner in Hamburg._\"\r\n\r\nBallin's idea of running a series of pleasure cruises did not meet with\r\nmuch support on the part of his associates; the public, however, took it\r\nup with enthusiasm from the very start. Early in 1891 Ballin himself\r\ntook part in the first trip to the Far East on board the express steamer\r\n_Auguste Victoria_. Organized pleasure trips on a small scale were by no\r\nmeans an entire novelty in Germany at that time; the Carl Stangen\r\nTourist Office in Berlin, for instance, regularly arranged such\r\nexcursions, including some to the Far East, for a limited number of\r\nparticipants. To do so, however, for as many as 241 persons, as Ballin\r\ndid, was something unheard-of until then, and necessitated a great deal\r\nof painstaking preparation. Among other things, the itinerary of the\r\nintended cruise, owing to the size and the draught of the steamer used,\r\nhad to be carefully worked out in detail, and arrangements had to be\r\nmade beforehand for the hotel accommodation and for the conveyance of\r\npassengers during the more extended excursions on shore. All these\r\nmatters gave plenty of scope to the organizing talents of the youthful\r\ndirector, and he passed the test with great credit.\r\n\r\nThe first Far Eastern cruise proved so great a success that it was\r\nrepeated in 1892. In the following year it started from New York, surely\r\na proof that the Company's reputation for such cruises was securely\r\nestablished not in Germany alone, but in the States as well. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, Hamburg had been visited by a terrible catastrophe which\r\nenormously interfered with the smooth working of the Company's express\r\nsteamer services. This was the cholera epidemic during the summer of\r\n1892. It lasted several weeks, and thousands of inhabitants fell victims\r\nto it. Those who were staying in Hamburg in that summer will never\r\nforget the horrors of the time. In the countries of Northern Europe\r\nviolent epidemics were practically unknown, and the scourge of cholera\r\nespecially had always been successfully combated at the eastern frontier\r\nof Germany, so that the alarm which spread over the whole country, and\r\nwhich led to the vigorous enforcement of the most drastic measures for\r\nisolating the rest of Germany from Hamburg, may easily be comprehended,\r\nhowever ludicrous those measures in some instances might appear. There\r\nare no two opinions as to the damage they inflicted on the commerce and\r\ntraffic of the city. The severest quarantine, of course, was instituted\r\nin the United States, and the passenger services to and from Hamburg\r\nceased to be run altogether, so that the transatlantic lines decided to\r\ntemporarily suspend the steerage pool agreement they had just concluded.\r\nThe Packetfahrt, in order not to stop its fast steamer services\r\ncompletely, first transferred them to Southampton, and afterwards to\r\nWilhelmshaven, thus abstaining from dispatching these boats to and from\r\nHamburg. The steerage traffic had to be discarded entirely, after an\r\nattempt to maintain it, with Stettin as its home port, had failed.\r\nFinancially this epidemic and its direct consequences brought the\r\nCompany almost to the verge of collapse, and the Packetfahrt had to stop\r\naltogether the payment of dividends for 1892, 1893, and 1894.\r\n\r\nBusiness was resumed in 1893, but at first it was very slow. Every means\r\nwere tried to induce the United States to rescind her isolation\r\nmeasures. An American doctor was appointed in Hamburg; disinfection was\r\ncarried out on a large scale; with great energy the city set herself to\r\nprevent the recurrence of a similar disaster. The Packetfahrt, in\r\nconjunction with the authorities, designed the plans for building the\r\nemigrants' halls situated at the outskirts of the city, which are unique\r\nof their kind and are still looked upon as exemplary. These plans owe\r\ntheir origin to the extremely talented Hamburg architect, Mr. Thielen,\r\nwhose early death is greatly to be regretted.\r\n\r\nAn important innovation was the establishment of regular medical control\r\nand medical treatment for the emigrants from the East of Europe on their\r\nreaching the German frontier, a measure which was decided upon and taken\r\nin hand by the Prussian Government. The expansion of the Packetfahrt's\r\nbusiness, of course, was most adversely affected by the epidemic and its\r\nafter-effects; and several years of consolidation were needed before the\r\nlatter could be overcome. Consequently, hardly any new services were\r\nopened during the years immediately following upon the epidemic.\r\n\r\nAn important step forward, which greatly strengthened the earning\r\ncapacities of the Company's resources, was taken in 1895, when the\r\nbuilding orders for the steamers of the \"P\" class were given. These\r\nvessels were of large size but of moderate speed. They were extremely\r\nseaworthy, and were capable of accommodating a great many passengers,\r\nespecially steeragers, as well as of carrying large quantities of cargo.\r\nThe number of services run by the Company was added to in 1893 by a line\r\nfrom New York to Italy, and in the following year by one from Italy to\r\nthe River Plate. Pool agreements were concluded with the Lloyd and the\r\nAllan Line with respect to the first-named route, and with the Italian\r\nsteamship companies with respect to the other. The agreement with the\r\nItalians, however, did not become operative until a few years\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the Packetfahrt celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its\r\nexistence--an event in which large sections of the public took a keen\r\ninterest. Perhaps the most noteworthy among the immense number of\r\nletters of congratulation which the Company received on that occasion is\r\nthe one sent by the chairman of the Cunard Line, of which the verbatim\r\ntext is given below. It was addressed to one of the directors in reply\r\nto an invitation to attend the celebrations in person.\r\n\r\n     \"It is with great regret I have to announce my inability to join\r\n     with you in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation\r\n     of your Company, to be held on board your s.s. _Auguste Victoria_.\r\n\r\n     \"I the more regret this as I have the greatest possible admiration\r\n     of the skill and enterprise which has directed the fortunes of your\r\n     Company, especially in recent years.\r\n\r\n     \"You were the first to give the travelling public the convenience\r\n     of a speedy and reliable transit between the two great continents\r\n     of the world by initiating a regular service of twin-screw steamers\r\n     of high speed and unexceptionable accommodation.\r\n\r\n     \"You also set the shipping world the example of the great economy\r\n     possible in the transit of the world's commodities in vessels of\r\n     greatly increased capacity and proportionate economy, which other\r\n     nations have been quick to follow and adopt to their great\r\n     advantage.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Company had furthermore met a felt want in giving most\r\n     luxurious and well-appointed accommodation for visiting scenes,\r\n     both new and old, of world-wide interest, and making such\r\n     journeyings, hitherto beset with anxiety and difficulty, as easy of\r\n     accomplishment as the ordinary railway journey at home.\r\n\r\n     \"You have succeeded in this, not through any adventitious aids,\r\n     such as Government subsidies, but by anticipating and then meeting\r\n     the wants of the travelling and commercial public; and no one, be\r\n     his nationality what it was, can, in the face of such facts,\r\n     abstain from offering his meed of praise to the foresight, acumen,\r\n     and ability that have accomplished such great results in such a\r\n     comparatively small time as the management and direction of the\r\n     Hamburg-American Packet Company.\r\n\r\n     \"I would venture, therefore, to thus congratulate you and your\r\n     colleagues, and whilst reiterating my regret at being prevented\r\n     from doing so at your forthcoming meeting, allow me the expression\r\n     of the wish that such meeting may be a happy and satisfactory one,\r\n     and that a new era of, if possible, increased success to the\r\n     Hamburg-American Packet Company may take date from it.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of the 'nineties, at last, a big expansion of the\r\nCompany's activities set in. In 1897 the Hamburg-Calcutta Line was\r\npurchased, but the service was discontinued, the steamers thus acquired\r\nbeing used for other purposes. Shortly before the close of the same year\r\na suggestion was put forward by some Hamburg firms that were engaged in\r\ndoing business with the Far East that the Packetfahrt should run a\r\nservice to that part of the world.\r\n\r\nJust then the steamship companies engaged in the Far Eastern trade were\r\non the point of coming to a rate agreement among themselves; and the\r\nmanagement of the Packetfahrt which, owing to the offer held out to it\r\nby Hamburg, Antwerp, and London firms, could hope to rely on finding a\r\nsure basis for its Far Eastern business, did not consider it wise to let\r\nthe favourable opportunity slip. Quick decision and rapid action, before\r\nthe proposed agreement of the interested lines had become an\r\naccomplished fact, were necessary; because, once the gates were closed,\r\nan outsider would find it difficult to gain admission to the ring.\r\n\r\nHence the negotiations with a view to the Packetfahrt joining in the Far\r\nEastern business, which had only been started during the second half of\r\nDecember, 1897, came to a close very soon; and in the early days of\r\nJanuary, 1898, the Packetfahrt advertised its intention of running\r\nmonthly sailings to Penang, Singapore, Hongkong, Shanghai, Yokohama, and\r\nHiogo. Six cargo steamers of 8,000 tons burden were entered into the new\r\nservice; and simultaneously an announcement was made to the effect that\r\nlarge fast passenger boats would be added to it as soon as the need for\r\nthese should make itself felt.\r\n\r\nThe participation in the Far Eastern business, and the consequent taking\r\nover of competing lines or the establishment of joint services with\r\nthem, was not the only important event of the year 1898 as far as the\r\ndevelopment of the Packetfahrt is concerned. In the spring of that same\r\nyear an agreement was made with the Philadelphia Shipping\r\nCompany--which, in its turn, had an agreement with the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company--by which the Packetfahrt undertook to run a regular\r\nservice of cargo steamers between Hamburg and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAn event of still greater importance, however, was the outbreak of war\r\nbetween the United States and Spain which also took place in that year.\r\nThe Spanish Government desired to strengthen the fighting power of its\r\nnavy by the addition of several auxiliary cruisers; and even some time\r\nbefore the war broke out an offer reached the Packetfahrt through the\r\nintermediary of a third party to purchase its two express steamers,\r\n_Columbia_ and _Normannia_, which were among the fastest ocean-liners\r\nafloat. Before accepting this offer, the Packetfahrt, in order to avoid\r\nthe reproach of having committed a breach of neutrality, first offered\r\nthese two steamers to the United States Government; but on its refusal\r\nto buy them, they were sold to the British firm acting on behalf of the\r\nSpanish Government, and re-sold to the latter. As the Packetfahrt had\r\nallowed a high rate of depreciation on the two boats, their book-value\r\nstood at a very low figure; and the considerable profit thus realized\r\nenabled it to acquire new vessels for the extension of its passenger\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a new express steamer, the _Kaiser Wilhelm der Grösse_, had\r\nbeen added to the fleet of the North German Lloyd. Ballin, having made a\r\nvoyage on board this vessel to New York, reported to the Trustees of his\r\nCompany that he considered her a splendid achievement. Owing to the\r\nheavy working expenses, however, she would not, he thought, prove a\r\ngreat success from a financial point of view. He held that the\r\nremunerativeness of express steamers was negatived by the heavy working\r\nexpenses and, as early as 1897, had projected the construction of two\r\nsteamers of very large proportions, but of less speed. This, however,\r\nwas not carried out. Instead, the Packetfahrt decided to build a vessel\r\nwhich was to be bigger and faster still than the _Kaiser Wilhelm der\r\nGrösse_. The new liner was built by the Stettin Vulkan yard, and\r\ncompleted in 1900. She was the _Deutschland_, the famous ocean\r\ngreyhound, a great improvement in size and equipment, and she held the\r\nblue riband of the Atlantic for a number of years.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the express service to New York had been\r\nsupplemented by the inauguration of an additional passenger service on\r\nthe same route, which proved a great success in every way. The steamers\r\nemployed were the combined passenger and cargo boats of moderate speed\r\nof the \"P\" class referred to above; and, their working expenses being\r\nvery low, they could carry the cargo at very low rates, so that they\r\nproved of great service to the rapidly expanding interchange of goods\r\nbetween Germany and the United States. Their great size made it\r\nnecessary to accelerate their loading and discharging facilities as much\r\nas possible. This necessity, among other things, led to the introduction\r\nof grain elevators which resulted in a great saving of time, as the\r\ngrain was henceforth no longer discharged in sacks, but loose. The\r\nCompany also decided to take the loading and discharging of all its\r\nvessels into its own hands. To accelerate the dispatch of steamers to\r\nthe utmost possible extent, it was decided in 1898 to enlarge once again\r\nthe Company's harbour facilities, and an agreement was concluded with\r\nthe Hamburg Government providing for the construction of large harbour\r\nbasins with the necessary quays, sheds, etc., in the district of\r\nKuhwärder on the southern banks of the Elbe.\r\n\r\nIt was typical of Ballin's policy of the geographical distribution of\r\nrisks and of the far-sighted views he held concerning the international\r\ncharacter of the shipping business that he attempted at the end of the\r\n'nineties to gain an extended footing abroad for the Company's\r\nactivities. The Packetfahrt therefore ordered the building of two\r\npassenger boats in Italian yards, and it was arranged that these vessels\r\nshould fly either the German or the Italian flag. In the end, however, a\r\nseparate Italian shipping company, the Italia, was set up, which was to\r\ndevote itself more particularly to the River Plate trade. When the\r\nfinancial results of the new enterprise failed to come up to\r\nexpectations, the shares were sold to Italian financiers in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe closing years of the nineteenth and the opening years of the\r\ntwentieth century represented a period of extraordinary prosperity to\r\nshipping business all over the world--a prosperity which was caused by\r\nthe outbreak of the South African war in 1899. An enormous amount of\r\ntonnage was required to carry the British troops, their equipment,\r\nhorses, etc., to South Africa, and the circumstance that this tonnage\r\ntemporarily ceased to be available for the needs of ordinary traffic\r\nconsiderably stiffened the freight rates. The favourable results thus\r\nobtained greatly stimulated the spirit of enterprise animating the\r\nshipping companies everywhere.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the business of the Company experienced a notable\r\nexpansion in another direction. A fierce rate war was in progress\r\nbetween the Hamburg-South American S.S. Co. and the firm of A. C. de\r\nFreitas & Co., and neither party seemed to be able to get the better of\r\nthe other. As early as 1893 Ballin, on behalf of the Hamburg-South\r\nAmerican S.S. Co., had carried on some negotiations with the firm of de\r\nFreitas with the object of bringing about an amalgamation of the two\r\ncompanies with respect to their services to Southern Brazil. In 1896 he\r\nhad done so again in compliance with the special request of Mr. Carl\r\nLaeisz, the chairman of the former company, and in 1898 he did so for\r\nthe third time, but in this case on his own initiative. No practical\r\nresults, however, were reached, and as Ballin was desirous of seeing an\r\nend being put to the hopeless struggle between the two rival firms, he\r\ntook up those negotiations for the fourth time in 1900, hoping to\r\nacquire the de Freitas Line for his own Company. He was successful, and\r\nan expert was nominated to fix the market value of the fourteen steamers\r\nthat were to change hands. As the valuation took place at a time when\r\nthe shipping business was in an exceedingly flourishing state, the price\r\nwhich he fixed worked out at so high an average per ton as was never\r\nagain paid before the outbreak of the war. The valuer told me that he\r\nhimself considered the price very high, so that he felt in duty bound to\r\ndraw Ballin's attention to it beforehand. Ballin tersely replied: \"I\r\nknow, but I want the business,\" thus making it perfectly clear that he\r\nattached more than ordinary importance to the deal.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the purchase of the de Freitas Lines had become an\r\naccomplished fact, arrangements were made with the Hamburg-South\r\nAmerican S.S. Company, which provided for a joint service to South\r\nAmerica, a service which was still further extended when the Packetfahrt\r\nbought up a British line trading from Antwerp to the Plate, thus also\r\nsecuring a footing at Antwerp in connexion with its South American\r\nbusiness. The necessity for taking such a step grew in proportion as\r\nAntwerp acquired an increasing importance owing to the increasing German\r\nexport business.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no country which can be served by the seaports of so\r\nmany foreign countries as Germany. Several Mediterranean ports attract\r\nto themselves a portion of the South German trade; Antwerp and some of\r\nthe French ports possess splendid railway connexion with Southern and\r\nWestern Germany, and both Antwerp and Rotterdam are in a position to\r\navail themselves of the highway of the Rhine as an excellent means of\r\ncommunication with the whole German hinterland. Finally, it must be\r\nremembered that the Scandinavian seaports are also to a certain extent\r\ncompeting for the German business, especially for the trade with the\r\nhinterland of the Baltic ports of Germany. All this goes to show that\r\nthe countries surrounding Germany which have for centuries striven to\r\nexercise a kind of political hegemony over Germany--or, rather,\r\ngenerally speaking, over Central Europe--are not without plenty of\r\nfacilities enabling them to try to capture large portions of the\r\ncarrying trade of these parts of Europe. This danger of a never-ending\r\neconomic struggle which would not benefit any of the competing rivals\r\nwas the real reason underlying Ballin's policy of compromise. He clearly\r\nrecognized that any other course of action would tend to make permanent\r\nthe existing chaos ruling in the realm of ocean shipping.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle for the carrying trade to and from Central Europe the\r\nport of Antwerp occupied a position all by itself. The more the\r\ncountries beyond the sea were opened up by the construction of new\r\nrailways and the establishment of industrial undertakings, and the more\r\norders the manufacturers in the Central European countries received in\r\nconsequence of the growing demand, the greater became the value of\r\nAntwerp to the shipping companies in every country. In this respect the\r\nearly years of the twentieth century witnessed an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment, which, in its turn, benefited the world's carrying trade to\r\nan ever-increasing extent. Never before had so much European capital\r\nbeen invested in overseas countries. Again, as a result of the Spanish\r\nwar the political and economic influence of the United States had\r\nenormously expanded in the West Indian islands, whilst, at the same\r\ntime, the Monroe doctrine was being applied more and more thoroughly and\r\nsystematically. Consequently the attention of the American investors was\r\nalso increasingly drawn towards those same countries. In Central America\r\nnew railway lines were constructed by British and American capital,\r\nincluding some right across the country from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific, thus considerably facilitating trade with the Pacific coast of\r\nAmerica. Other lines were built in Brazil and in the Argentine, and\r\nharbour and dock facilities were constructed in nearly all the more\r\nimportant South American ports. French and Belgian capital shared in\r\nthese undertakings, and some German capital was also employed for the\r\nsame purpose. The Trans-Andine railway was completed, and numerous\r\nindustrial works were added to the existing ones. The great economic\r\nadvance was not exclusively restricted to South America; it extended to\r\nthe Far East, to the great British dominions beyond the sea, especially\r\nto Canada and Australia, and--after the close of the South African\r\nWar--to Africa also. Russia built the great Trans-Siberian railway, and\r\nGermany commenced to exploit the resources of her colonies. As a result\r\nof all these activities the iron and steel manufacturers were\r\noverwhelmed with export orders. This applies particularly to the German\r\niron and steel manufacturers, whose leading organization, the\r\nStahlwerks-Verband, largely favoured the route _via_ Antwerp, because it\r\nwas the cheapest, to the great detriment of the German ports. Thus the\r\nGerman shipowners were compelled to follow the traffic, and the\r\nimportance of Antwerp increased from year to year. The Hamburg-Amerika\r\nLinie met this development by opening a special branch office for\r\ndealing with the Antwerp business.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, a year before the Hamburg-Amerika Linie established itself in\r\nthe services to Brazil and the River Plate, a line had been started by\r\nthe Company to Northern Brazil and the Amazon River. The conflict with\r\nthe Booth Line which resulted from this step was amicably settled in\r\n1902 through negotiations conducted by Ballin. Later on, indeed, the\r\nrelations between the two companies became very cordial, and even led to\r\nthe conclusion of a far-reaching community of interest agreement, the\r\nBooth Line being represented in Hamburg by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie,\r\nand the latter in Brazil by the British company. An agreement of such\r\nkind was only feasible when a particularly strong feeling of mutual\r\ntrust existed between the two contracting partners, and Ballin\r\nrepeatedly declared that he looked upon this agreement with the Booth\r\nLine as the most satisfactory of all he had concluded.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the West Indian business was extended by opening a passenger\r\nservice to Mexico, and another noteworthy event which took place during\r\nthe same year was the conclusion of an agreement with the big German\r\niron works in the Rhenish-Westphalian district by which the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie undertook to ship to Emden the Swedish iron ore\r\nneeded by them from the ports of Narvik and Lulea. Two special steamers\r\nwere ordered to be exclusively used for this service. Henceforth Emden\r\nbegan to play an important part in connexion with the German ore supply,\r\nand the real prosperity of that port dated from that time.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1901 Ballin decided to embark on a trip round the world. He\r\nthought it desirable to do so in order to acquire a first-hand knowledge\r\nof the Far Eastern situation, which had become of special interest to\r\nthe country owing to the acquisition by Germany of Tsingtau, and to the\r\nunrest in China. His special object was to study the questions that had\r\nbecome urgent in connexion with the organization of the passenger\r\nservice of which the Packetfahrt, in consequence of the agreement with\r\nthe Lloyd, had just become a partner. There was, in addition, the\r\nproject of starting a Pacific service, which engaged his attention. All\r\nthese important details could only be properly attended to on the spot.\r\nIt became necessary to acquire a business footing in the various ports\r\nconcerned, to organize the coast transport services which were to act as\r\nfeeders to the main line, etc. Besides, the Packetfahrt, and the Lloyd\r\nas well, had special reasons for being interested in Far Eastern\r\naffairs, as both companies had been entrusted with troop transports and\r\nthe transport of equipment needed for the German contingent during the\r\ntroubles in China. During his Far Eastern trip Ballin wrote detailed\r\naccounts dealing with the business matters he attended to, and also\r\ndescribing his personal impressions of persons and things in general,\r\nthe former kind addressed to the Board of his Company, the latter to his\r\nmother. These letters are full of interest; they present a more faithful\r\ndescription of his character as a man, and as a man of business, than\r\ncould be given in any other way. I shall therefore quote a few extracts\r\nfrom the comprehensive reports, commencing with those he wrote to his\r\nmother:--\r\n\r\n\"_On board the I.M.S._ '_Kiautschou_'\r\n\"_January 16th, 1901._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The weather was cold and windy when we arrived late at night\r\n     outside Port Said, and midnight was well past when we had taken up\r\n     the pilot and were making our way into the port. The intense cold\r\n     had caused me to leave the navigating bridge; and as I did not\r\n     think it likely that our agent would arrive on board with his\r\n     telegrams until the next morning, I had followed the example of my\r\n     wife and of nearly all the other passengers and had gone to bed.\r\n     However, if we had thought that we should be able to sleep, we soon\r\n     found out our mistake. The steamer had scarcely taken up her\r\n     moorings when several hundreds of dusky natives, wildly screaming\r\n     and gesticulating, and making a noise that almost rent the skies,\r\n     invaded her in order to fill her bunkers with the 800 tons of coal\r\n     that had been ordered. Perhaps there is no place anywhere where the\r\n     bunkers are filled more rapidly than at Port Said, and certainly\r\n     none where this is done to the accompaniment of a more deafening\r\n     noise. Just imagine a horde of natives wildly screaming at the top\r\n     of their voices, and add to this the noise produced by the coal\r\n     incessantly shot into the bunkers, and the shouting of the men in\r\n     command going on along with it. You will easily understand that it\r\n     was impossible for anyone to go to sleep under conditions such as\r\n     these.... After trying for several hours, I gave up the attempt,\r\n     and, on entering the drawing-room, I found that willy-nilly (but,\r\n     as Wippchen would have said, more nilly than willy) practically all\r\n     the other passengers had done the same thing. There I was also\r\n     informed that those who were in the know had not even made an\r\n     attempt to go to sleep, but had gone ashore at 2 A.M. Port Said is\r\n     a typical brigands' den, and relies for its prosperity on the mail\r\n     packets calling there. The shops, the taverns, the music-halls, and\r\n     the gambling places are all organized on lines in accordance with\r\n     the needs of modern traffic. So it was not surprising to see that\r\n     the proprietors of these more or less inviting places of\r\n     entertainment had brightly lit up their premises, and hospitably\r\n     opened their doors despite the unearthly hour, being quite willing\r\n     to try and entice the unwary passengers into their clutches.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Between_ ADEN _and_ COLOMBO.\r\n\"_January 24th_, 1901.\r\n\r\n     \" ... We did not stop long at Aden; and as the quarantine\r\n     regulations for all vessels arriving from Port Said were very\r\n     strict, it became impossible for the passengers on board the\r\n     _Kiautschou_ to land on the island. Aden, which the British would\r\n     like to turn into a second Gibraltar, is situated in a barren,\r\n     treeless district, and is wedged in between hills without any\r\n     vegetation. Small fortifications are scattered all over the island.\r\n     It must be a desolate spot for Europeans to live at. The British\r\n     officers call it 'The Devil's Punch Bowl,' and to be transferred to\r\n     Aden is equivalent to them to being deported.\"\r\n\r\n\"_January 28th_, 1901.\r\n\r\n     \" ... In the meantime we have spent a most enjoyable and\r\n     unforgettable day at Colombo. The pilot brought the news of Queen\r\n     Victoria's death, which filled us with lively sympathy, and which\r\n     caused a great deal of grief among the British passengers. Shortly\r\n     before 9 o'clock we went ashore: and as the business offices do not\r\n     open until an hour later--thus preventing me from calling on my\r\n     business friends at that hour--I took a carriage-drive through the\r\n     magnificent park-like surroundings of the city. The people one\r\n     meets there are a fit match to the beautiful scenery; but whilst in\r\n     former times they were the rulers of this fertile island, they are\r\n     now, thanks to the blessings of civilization, the servants of their\r\n     European masters....\r\n\r\n     \"When we reached the old-established Oriental Hotel where we had\r\n     our lunch, we met there a number of our fellow-passengers busily\r\n     engaged in bargaining with the Singhalese and Indian dealers who\r\n     generally flock to the terraces of the hotel as soon as a mail\r\n     packet has arrived. The picture presented by such Oriental\r\n     bargaining is the same everywhere, except that the Colombo dealers\r\n     undeniably manifest an inborn gracefulness and gentlemanly bearing.\r\n     When I tried to get rid of an old man who was pestering me with his\r\n     offers to sell some precious stones, he said to me, in the\r\n     inimitable singing tone of voice used by these people when they\r\n     speak English: 'Just touch this stone, please, but do not buy it: I\r\n     only wish to receive it back from your lucky hands.' In spite of\r\n     their manners, however, these fellows are the biggest cheats on\r\n     earth. Another dealer wanted to sell me a sheet of old Ceylon\r\n     stamps for which he demanded fifteen marks--a price which, as he\r\n     stated, meant a clean loss of five marks to him. When I offered him\r\n     two marks instead, merely because I had got tired of him, he handed\r\n     me the whole sheet, and said: 'Please take them; I know that one\r\n     day I shall be rewarded for the sacrifice which I bring.' Later on\r\n     I discovered that the same man had sold exactly the same stamps to\r\n     a fellow-passenger for 50 pfennigs, and that he had told the same\r\n     story to him as to me. Such are the blessings of our marvellous\r\n     civilization....\r\n\r\n     \" ... In the afternoon we went for a magnificent drive to the Mount\r\n     Lavinia Hotel, which is beautifully situated on a hill affording an\r\n     extensive view of the sea. Boys and girls as beautiful as Greek\r\n     statues, and as swift-footed as fallow deer, pursued us in our\r\n     carriage, begging for alms. It was curious to see with what\r\n     unfailing certainty they managed to distinguish the German from the\r\n     English passengers, and they were not slow in availing themselves\r\n     of this opportunity to palm off what little German they knew on us.\r\n     'Oh, my father! My beautiful mother! You are a great lady! Please\r\n     give me ten cents, my good uncle!' We were quite astonished to meet\r\n     such a large progeny....\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 2nd_, 1901.\r\n\r\n     \".... The entrance to Singapore is superbly beautiful. The steamer\r\n     slowly wended her way through the channels between numerous small\r\n     islands clad with the most luxurious vegetation, so that it almost\r\n     took us two hours to reach the actual harbour.... The food question\r\n     is extremely complicated in this part of the tropics, which is\r\n     favoured by kind Nature more than is good. The excessive fertility\r\n     of the soil makes the cultivation of vegetables and cereals quite\r\n     impossible, as everything runs to seed within a few days, so that,\r\n     for instance, potatoes have to be obtained from Java, and green\r\n     vegetables from Mulsow's, in Hamburg. I am sure my geography master\r\n     at school, who never ceased to extol the richness of the soil of\r\n     this British colony, was not aware of this aspect of the matter.\r\n\r\n     \"Singapore is a rapidly developing emporium for the trade with the\r\n     Far East. It has succeeded in attracting to itself much of the\r\n     commerce with the Dutch Indies, British North Borneo, the\r\n     Philippines, and the Federated Malay States. To achieve this, of\r\n     course, was a difficult matter, even with the aid of the shipping\r\n     companies, but its clever and energetic business community managed\r\n     to do it. We Germans may well be proud of the fact that our\r\n     countrymen now occupy the premier position in the business life of\r\n     the city....\r\n\r\n     \" ... We spent about thirty-six hours at Saigon. This city has been\r\n     laid out by the French with admirable skill, and there is no doubt\r\n     but that Indo-China is a most valuable possession of theirs. As\r\n     regards the difference in the national character of the French and\r\n     the British, it is interesting to note that the former have just\r\n     erected a magnificent building for a theatre at Saigon, at a cost\r\n     of 2-1/2 million francs. The British would never have dreamt of\r\n     doing such a thing; I am sure they would have invested that money\r\n     in the building of club-houses and race-courses....\"\r\n\r\n\"_February 16th_, 1901.\r\n\r\n     \" ... As far as social life and social pleasures are concerned, it\r\n     must be said that the German colony at Hongkong is in no way\r\n     inferior to that at Singapore. Premier rank in this respect must be\r\n     assigned to the Siebs family. Mr. Siebs, the senior member of the\r\n     Hamburg firm of Siemssen and Co., has been a resident in the East\r\n     for a long term of years--forty-two, if I remember rightly; and he\r\n     now occupies an exceedingly prominent position both in German and\r\n     British society. That this is so is largely due--apart from his\r\n     intimate knowledge of all that concerns the trade and commerce of\r\n     China, and apart from his own amiability and never-failing\r\n     generosity--to his charming wife, who, by means of the hospitality,\r\n     the refinement, and the exemplary management characterizing her\r\n     home, has been chiefly instrumental in acquiring for the house of\r\n     Siebs the high reputation it enjoys. Whoever is received by Mrs.\r\n     Siebs, I have been told, is admitted everywhere in Hongkong\r\n     society.\r\n\r\n     \"Even though I only give here an outline of my impressions, I\r\n     cannot refrain from adding a few details dealing with some aspects\r\n     of everyday life at Hongkong, this jewel among the crown colonies\r\n     of Britain. The offices of the big firms and of the shipping\r\n     companies' agencies, most of them housed in beautiful buildings,\r\n     flank the water's edge; farther back there is the extensive\r\n     shopping quarter, and still more in the rear there is the Chinese\r\n     quarter, teeming with an industrious population. Being myself so\r\n     much mixed up with the means of communication, I am surely entitled\r\n     to make a few remarks concerning this subject in particular. Horses\r\n     are but rarely seen, and are only used for riding, and sporting\r\n     purposes generally. Their place is taken by the coolies, who no\r\n     doubt represent the most pitiable type of humanity--at least, from\r\n     the point of view of a sensitive person. In the low-lying part of\r\n     the town the jinrikishas, which are drawn by coolies, predominate;\r\n     but the greater part of Hongkong is situated on the slopes of a\r\n     hill, and nearly all the private residences are built along the\r\n     beautifully kept, terrace-like roads leading up to the summit of\r\n     the peak. In this part the chair coolies take the place of the\r\n     jinrikisha coolies; and in the low-lying parts also it is\r\n     considered more stylish to be carried by chair coolies. The\r\n     ordinary hired chairs are generally carried by two coolies only,\r\n     but four are needed for the private ones. The work done by these\r\n     poor wretches is fatiguing in the extreme. They have to drag their\r\n     masters up and down the hill, which is very steep in places, and it\r\n     is a horrid sensation to be carried by these specimens of panting\r\n     humanity for the first time. In the better-class European\r\n     households each member of the family has his own chair, and the\r\n     necessary coolies along with it, who are paid the princely wage of\r\n     from 16 marks to 17 marks 50 pfennigs a month. They also receive a\r\n     white jacket and a pair of white drawers reaching to the knee, but\r\n     they have to provide their own food. The poor fellows are generally\r\n     natives from the interior parts of the island. They spend about one\r\n     mark a week on their food; the rest they send home to their\r\n     families. They are mostly married, and the money they earn in their\r\n     capacity as private coolies represents to them a fortune. They\r\n     rarely live longer than forty years; in fact, their average length\r\n     of life is said not to exceed thirty-five. As many as eight coolies\r\n     were engaged to attend to the needs of my wife and myself for the\r\n     time of our stay. The poor creatures, who, by the way, had quite a\r\n     good time in our service, spent the whole day from early in the\r\n     morning to late at night lying in front of a side entrance to our\r\n     hotel, except when they had to do their work for us....\r\n\r\n     \" ... The Chinese have only one annual holiday--New Year. They are\r\n     hard at work during the whole year; they know of no Sundays and of\r\n     no holidays, but the commencement of the New Year is associated\r\n     with a peculiar belief of theirs. To celebrate the event, they take\r\n     their best clothes out of pawn (which, for the rest of the year,\r\n     they keep at the pawnbroker's to prevent them from being stolen).\r\n     To keep the evil spirits away during the coming twelvemonth, they\r\n     burn hundreds of thousands of firecrackers when the New Year\r\n     begins, and also during the first and second days of it,\r\n     accompanied by the noise of the firing of guns. One must have been\r\n     through it all in order to understand it. For the better part of\r\n     two days and two nights one could imagine a fierce battle raging in\r\n     the neighbourhood; crackers were exploding on all sides, together\r\n     with rockets and fireballs, and the whole was augmented by the\r\n     shouting and screaming of the revellers. It was a mad noise, and we\r\n     could scarcely get any sleep at night.\r\n\r\n     \"The houses in the Chinese quarter were decorated up to the roofs\r\n     with bunting, beautiful big lanterns, paper garlands with religious\r\n     inscriptions, and a mass of lovely flowers.\r\n\r\n     \"On such days--the only holidays they possess--the Chinese\r\n     population are in undisputed possession of their town, and the\r\n     British administration is wise enough not to interfere with the\r\n     enjoyment of these sober and hard-working people. I really wonder\r\n     how the German police would act in such cases....\"\r\n\r\n\"SHANGHAI, _March 6th, 1901_.\r\n\r\n     \" ... It is surely no exaggeration to describe Shanghai as the New\r\n     York of the Far East. The whole of the rapidly increasing trade\r\n     with the Yangtse ports, and the bulk of that with the northern\r\n     parts of the country, passes through Shanghai. The local German\r\n     colony is much larger than the one at Hongkong; and here, too, it\r\n     is pleasant to find that our countrymen are playing an extremely\r\n     important part in the extensive business life of the town....\"\r\n\r\n\"_Between_ TSINGTAU _and_ NAGASAKI,\r\n_on board the s.s_ _'Sibiria_.'\r\n\"_March 18th, 1901._\r\n\r\n     \"Our s.s. _Sibiria_ had arrived in the harbour about ten days ago,\r\n     and was now ready for our use. I had decided first of all to make a\r\n     trip up the Yang-tse-Kiang on board the _Sibiria_, because I wanted\r\n     to get to know this important river, which flows through such a\r\n     fertile tract of country, and on the banks of which so many of the\r\n     busiest cities of China are situated. The Yangtse--as it is usually\r\n     called for shortness' sake--is navigable for very large-sized\r\n     ocean-going steamers for a several days' journey. During the summer\r\n     months it often happens that the level of the water in its upper\r\n     reaches rises by as much as 50 feet, which--on account of the\r\n     danger of the tremendous floods resulting from it--has made it\r\n     necessary to pay special attention to the laying-out of the cities\r\n     situated on its banks. The object of our journey was Nanking. This\r\n     city, which was once the all-powerful capital of the Celestial\r\n     Empire, has never again reached its former importance since its\r\n     destruction during the great revolution of 1862, and since the\r\n     choice of Peking as the residence of the Imperial family. Two years\r\n     ago it was thrown open to foreign commerce; and the Powers\r\n     immediately established their consulates in the city, not only\r\n     because a new era of development is looked forward to, but also\r\n     because Nanking is the seat of a viceroy.\r\n\r\n     \"Our amiable consul, Herr v. Oertzen, received us with the greatest\r\n     hospitality. The German colony which he has to look after consists\r\n     of only one member so far. This young gentleman, who holds an\r\n     appointment in connexion with the Chinese customs administration,\r\n     feels, as is but natural, quite happy in consequence of enjoying a\r\n     practical monopoly of the protection extended to him by the home\r\n     government. He has helped himself to the consul's cigars and to his\r\n     moselle to such good effect that the _Sibiria_ arrived just in time\r\n     to prevent the German colony at Nanking from lodging a complaint\r\n     regarding the insufficiency of the supplies put at its disposal by\r\n     the Government. The consul told us that we should never have a\r\n     chance of coming across another Chinese town that could compare\r\n     with the interior of Nanking, and so we had to make up our minds\r\n     to pay a visit to these parts.\r\n\r\n     \"I had seen plenty of dirt and misery at Jaffa and Jerusalem, but I\r\n     have never found so much filth and wretchedness anywhere as I\r\n     noticed at Nanking. My wife and a charming young lady who\r\n     accompanied us on our Yangtse expedition were borne in genuine\r\n     sedan chairs as used for the mandarins, preceded by the interpreter\r\n     of the consulate, and followed by the rest of us, who were riding\r\n     on mules provided with those typically Chinese saddles, which,\r\n     owing to their hardness, may justly claim to rank among the\r\n     instruments of torture.\r\n\r\n     \"Our procession wended its way through a maze of indescribably\r\n     narrow streets crowded with a moving mass of human beings and\r\n     animals. Everywhere cripples and blind men lay moaning in front of\r\n     their miserable hovels, and it almost seemed that there were more\r\n     people suffering from some disease or other than there were healthy\r\n     ones. When we stopped outside the big temple of Confucius, where\r\n     the ladies of our party dismounted from their chairs, the people,\r\n     in spite of their natural timidity, flocked to see us, because they\r\n     had probably never seen any European ladies until then. We were\r\n     thankful when at last we reached the consulate building again, and\r\n     when, after having had a good bath, we are able to enjoy a cup of\r\n     tea.\r\n\r\n     \" ... In the early hours of March 13th our steamer arrived at\r\n     Tsingtau. I was surprised and delighted with what I saw. There, in\r\n     spite of innumerable difficulties, a city had sprung up in an\r\n     incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\n     \"Rooms had been reserved for us at the handsome, but very cold,\r\n     Hotel Prinz Heinrich; and in the afternoon of the day of our\r\n     arrival we strolled up the roads, which were still somewhat dusty,\r\n     and in parts only half finished, to the summit of the hill where\r\n     the acting Governor and the officers of higher rank had their\r\n     homes. Even though it is true that up to now military necessities\r\n     have taken precedence in the laying-out of the town, so that the\r\n     needs of trade and traffic have not received due attention, it must\r\n     be admitted that a wonderful piece of constructive work has been\r\n     achieved. All the members of our party--especially those who, like\r\n     Dr. Knappe, our consul-general at Shanghai, had known the place two\r\n     years ago--were most agreeably surprised at the progress that had\r\n     been made.\r\n\r\n     \"Our first few days at Tsingtau were spent much as they were\r\n     everywhere else--plenty of work during the day-time, and plenty of\r\n     social duties in the evenings. But things began to look different\r\n     on Saturday morning, when my old friend and well-wisher,\r\n     Field-Marshal Count Waldersee, arrived on board H.M.S. _Kaiserin\r\n     Auguste_. He had announced that his arrival would take place at 9\r\n     A.M., and his flagship cast anchor with military punctuality. The\r\n     Governor and I went on board to welcome the old gentleman, who was\r\n     evidently greatly touched at meeting me out here, and it was plain\r\n     to see that my presence in this part of the world made him almost\r\n     feel homesick. The Field-Marshal very much dislikes the\r\n     restrictions imposed on his activities; and judging from all he\r\n     told me, I must confess that a great military leader has hardly\r\n     ever before been faced with a more thankless task than he. On the\r\n     one hand he is handicapped through the diplomatists, and on the\r\n     other through the want of unanimity among the Powers. Thus, instead\r\n     of fulfilling the soldier's task with which he is entrusted, he is\r\n     compelled to waste his time in idleness, and to preside at endless\r\n     conferences at which matters are discussed dealing with the most\r\n     trivial questions of etiquette. He really deserves something better\r\n     than that....\"\r\n\r\n\"TOKIO. _March 31st, 1901._\r\n\r\n     \" ... What a difference between Japan and the cold and barren north\r\n     of China! There everything was dull and gloomy, whilst this country\r\n     is flooded with sunshine. Here we are surrounded by beautifully\r\n     wooded hills, and a magnificent harbour extends right into the\r\n     heart of the city. From the windows of our rooms we overlook big\r\n     liners and powerful men-of-war, and our own _Sibiria_ has chosen\r\n     such a berth that the Hapag flag merrily floating in the breeze\r\n     gives us a friendly welcome.\r\n\r\n     \"The difference in the national character of the Chinaman and the\r\n     Japanese clearly proves the great influence which the climate and\r\n     the natural features of a country can exercise on its inhabitants.\r\n     The one always grave and sulky, and not inclined to be friendly;\r\n     the other always cheerful, fond of gossip, and overflowing with\r\n     politeness in all his intercourse with strangers. But it must not\r\n     be forgotten that the integrity of the Chinese, especially of the\r\n     Chinese merchants, is simply beyond praise, whereas the Japanese\r\n     have a reputation for using much cunning and very little sincerity,\r\n     so that European business men cannot put much faith in them.\r\n\r\n     \"The women of Japan are known to us through 'The Mikado' and 'The\r\n     Geisha.'

In one week the stranger will become more closely\r\n     acquainted with the womenfolk and the family life of Japan than he\r\n     would with those of China after half a dozen years of residence in\r\n     their midst. In China the women are kept in seclusion as much as\r\n     possible, but the whole family life of the Japs is carried on with\r\n     an utter indifference to publicity. This is due to a large extent\r\n     to the way their homes are built. Their houses are just as dainty\r\n     as they are themselves; and it is really quite remarkable to see\r\n     that the Japs, who closely imitate everything they see in Europe,\r\n     still build them exactly as they have done from time immemorial.\r\n     They are practically without windows, and in place of these the\r\n     openings in the walls are filled with paper stretched on to frames.\r\n     Instead of doors there are movable screens made of lattice-work;\r\n     and since everything is kept wide open during the day-time one can\r\n     look right into the rooms from the street. In the summer the\r\n     Japanese make their home in the streets, and we are told that then\r\n     the most intimate family scenes are enacted in the open air. I am\r\n     of opinion that this, far from pointing to a want of morality, is\r\n     really the outcome of a highly developed code of morals.

Time translated many of his suggestions\r\ninto flourishing actualities, some of which survived the 1914-18 years;\r\nothers disappeared in the cataclysm; others, again, by the lapse of time\r\nhave not the keen general interest that appertained to the ideas when\r\nthey fell fresh-minted from his pen. The following, however, in regard\r\nto China and Japan, are worthy of record:\r\n\r\n\"_Shanghai._\r\n_March 4th, 1901._\r\n\r\n     \"I am not quite satisfied with the course which the negotiations\r\n     concerning the possible inauguration of a Yangtse line have taken\r\n     so far.\r\n\r\n     \"The vessels employed are of the flat-bottomed kind, some being\r\n     paddle boats, others twin-screw steamers. In their outward\r\n     appearance the Yangtse steamers, owing to their high erections on\r\n     deck, greatly resemble the saloon steamers plying on the Hudson.\r\n     Their draught rarely exceeds 12 feet, and those which occasionally\r\n     go higher up the river than Hankau draw even less. Most of the\r\n     money earned by these boats is derived from the immense Chinese\r\n     passenger traffic they carry.... The chief difficulty we have\r\n     experienced in our preparations for the opening of a Yangtse line\r\n     of our own consists in the absence of suitable pier\r\n     accommodation....\"\r\n\r\n\"_On board the s.s.

Matters are quite\r\n     different with respect to Chin-kiang where we are stopping now, a\r\n     port which is even now carrying on a thriving trade with the\r\n     interior parts of the country. It can scarcely be doubted that, if\r\n     the Celestial Empire is thrown open to the Western nations still\r\n     more than has been done up to now, the commerce of the Yangtse\r\n     ports is bound to assume large proportions. During the summer\r\n     months, i.e. for practically two-thirds of the year, the Yangtse is\r\n     navigable for ocean-going steamers of deep draught, even more so\r\n     than the Mississippi. At that time of the year the volume of water\r\n     carried by the river increases enormously in certain reaches. This\r\n     increase has been found to amount to as much as 38 feet, and some\r\n     of the steamers of the Russian Volunteer Fleet going up to Hankau\r\n     possess a draught which exceeds 25 feet....\"\r\n\r\n\"_On board the Sibiria between_\r\nTSINGTAU AND JAPAN.\r\n_March 19th, 1901._\r\n\r\n     \" ... We arrived at Tsingtau on the morning of March 14th. The\r\n     impression produced by this German colony on the new-comer is an\r\n     exceedingly favourable one. Everywhere a great deal of diligent\r\n     work has been performed, and one feels almost inclined to think\r\n     that the building activity has proceeded too fast, so that the\r\n     inevitable reaction will not fail to take place. Looked at from our\r\n     shipping point of view, it must be stated that the work\r\n     accomplished looks too much like Wilhelmshaven, and too little like\r\n     Hongkong. It was, of course, a foregone conclusion that in the\r\n     development of a colony which is completely ruled by the Admiralty\r\n     the naval interests would predominate. However, there is still time\r\n     to remedy the existing defects, and I left Kiautschou with the\r\n     conviction that a promising future is in store for it. Only the\r\n     landing facilities are hopelessly inadequate at present; and as to\r\n     the accommodation for merchant vessels which is in course of being\r\n     provided, it would seem that too extensive a use has been made of\r\n     the supposed fact that mistakes are only there in order to be\r\n     committed, and that it would be a pity not to commit as many as\r\n     possible....\"\r\n\r\n\"_On board the s.s.

In the meantime I have had opportunities of slightly\r\n     familiarizing myself in more respects than one with the conditions\r\n     ruling in Japan.\r\n\r\n     \"The country is faced with an economic crisis. Encouraged by a\r\n     reckless system of credit, she has imported far more than\r\n     necessary; she is suffering from a shortage of money, which is sure\r\n     to paralyse her importing capacities for some time to come.\r\n\r\n     \"It seems pretty certain too, that future development will be\r\n     influenced by another and far more serious factor, viz.: the\r\n     ousting of the German by the American commerce from the Japanese\r\n     market. The exports from the United States to Japan have increased\r\n     just as much as those to China.... I cannot help thinking that in\r\n     the coming struggle America will enjoy immense advantages over us;\r\n     but you must permit me to postpone the presentation of a detailed\r\n     statement showing my reasons for thinking so until my return to\r\n     Hamburg.... I believe we shall be well advised to establish as soon\r\n     as possible a service between the Far East and the Pacific coast of\r\n     America....\"\r\n\r\nIn 1903 far-reaching alterations were made in the relations existing\r\nbetween the Hamburg-Amerika Linie and the North German Lloyd, which had\r\nbecome somewhat less friendly than usual in more respects than one; and\r\nin particular the agreement concerning the Far Eastern services of both\r\ncompanies was subjected to some considerable modifications.\r\n\r\nThe year 1903 is also remarkable for an event which, although not of\r\ngreat importance from the business point of view, is of interest in\r\nother respects. This event was the establishment of business relations\r\nwith a Danish company concerning, in the first place, the West Indian\r\ntrade, and later that with Russia also. The Danish concern in question\r\nwas the East Asiatic Company, of Copenhagen. The founder of this company\r\nwas a Mr. Andersen, one of the most successful business men known to\r\nmodern commercial enterprise, and certainly not only the most successful\r\none of his own country, but also one of high standing internationally.\r\nWhen still quite young he founded a business in Further India which,\r\nalthough conducted at first on a small scale only, he was able to\r\nextend by the acquisition of valuable concessions, especially of\r\nteak-wood plantations in Siam. In course of time this business developed\r\ninto a shipping firm which, owing to the concessions just mentioned, was\r\nalways in a position to ship cargo of its own--an advantage which proved\r\ninestimable when business was bad and no other freight was forthcoming.\r\nWhen Mr. Andersen returned to Europe he continued to enlarge his\r\nbusiness, making Copenhagen its centre. He enjoyed the special patronage\r\nof the Danish Royal Family, and afterwards also that of the Imperial\r\nRussian family. His special well-wisher and a partner of his firm was\r\nthe Princess Marie of Denmark, who became known in the political world\r\nbecause she incurred the enmity of Bismarck, chiefly on account of her\r\nattempt to stir up ill feeling between the Iron Chancellor and Tsar\r\nAlexander III. Bismarck, in the second volume of his memoirs, describes\r\nhow he succeeded in circumventing her plans through a personal meeting\r\nwith the Tsar. It was the exceptional business abilities of the Princess\r\nMarie which brought Mr. Andersen into contact with the Russian Imperial\r\nfamily. It is typical of the common sense of the Princess and of her\r\nunaffected manners that she arrived at the offices of the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie one day without having been previously announced;\r\nand as she did not give her name to the attendant outside Ballin's\r\nprivate office, he could only tell him that \"a lady\" wanted to see him.\r\nThe two letters addressed to Ballin which are given below are also\r\nillustrative of her style.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"_January 17th_, 1904.\r\n\r\n     \"I hope you will excuse my writing in French to you, but you may\r\n     reply to me in English. I have had a chat with Director Andersen,\r\n     who told me that your discussions with him have led to nothing. I\r\n     greatly regret this, both for personal reasons and in the interests\r\n     of the business. I am convinced that your negotiations would have\r\n     had the desired result if it had not been for some special\r\n     obstacles with which this new company had to contend. It is such a\r\n     pity that Mr. Andersen had to attend to so many other things. If\r\n     you and he alone had had to deal with it, and if it had been purely\r\n     a business matter, the agreement would certainly have been\r\n     concluded at once. Perhaps you and Andersen will shortly discover a\r\n     basis on which you can co-operate. I personally should highly\r\n     appreciate an understanding between my company and yours if it\r\n     could be brought about, so that you could work together hand in\r\n     hand like two good friends. You _must_ help me with it. Mr.\r\n     Andersen was so charmed with your amiability when he came back. One\r\n     other thing I must tell you, because I possess sufficient business\r\n     experience to understand it, and that is that both he and I admire\r\n     you as a man of business. I should be delighted if you could come\r\n     here; but I request you to give a few days' notice of your arrival.\r\n     Wishing you every success in your undertakings and the best of luck\r\n     during the new year,\r\n\r\n\"I remain, Yours faithfully,\r\n(_signed_) \"MARIE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR DIRECTOR,\r\n\r\n\"_February 10th, 1905._\r\n\r\n     \"I am so delighted to hear from Mr. Andersen that his company and\r\n     yours intend to co-operate in the Danish West Indies and in Russia\r\n     to your mutual interest. I have always held that such an\r\n     understanding between you and Mr. Andersen would lead to good\r\n     results, and you may feel convinced that I shall extend to you not\r\n     only my personal assistance and sympathy, but also that of my\r\n     family, and that of my Russian family, all of whom take a great\r\n     interest in this matter. I am looking forward to seeing you in\r\n     Hamburg early in March on my way to France. With my best regards,\r\n\r\n\"Yours faithfully,\r\n(_signed_) \"MARIE.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1904, after the close of Kiel Week, Ballin paid a visit to\r\nCopenhagen. There he met the Princess Marie and the King and Queen of\r\nDenmark, and was invited to dine with them at Bernstorff Castle. The\r\nbusiness outcome of the negotiations was that in 1905 a joint service to\r\nthe West Indies was established between the Hamburg-Amerika Linie and\r\nthe Danish West Indian Company. Four of the big new steamers of the\r\nlatter were leased to the Packetfahrt, and operated by that company,\r\nwhich thus not only increased the tonnage at its disposal, but also\r\nsucceeded in eliminating an unnecessary competition.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Packetfahrt bought the larger part of the shares of\r\nthe Russian East Asiatic S.S. Company owned by the Danish firm. The\r\nobject of the purchase was to establish a community of interests with\r\nthe Russian Company. The Kaiser took great interest in this scheme, and\r\nduring his visits to Copenhagen in 1903 and 1905 Mr. Andersen reported\r\nto him on the subject. It was intended to bring about close business\r\nrelations between Germany, Russia, and Denmark for the special purpose\r\nof developing Russian trade, and to organize the Russian East Asiatic\r\nS.S. Company on such lines as would make it a suitable instrument to\r\nthis end. It is to be regretted that the community of interest agreement\r\nthen concluded was not of long duration. The Russian bureaucracy made\r\nall sorts of difficulties, and it is possible that the representatives\r\nof the Hamburg-Amerika Linie in Russia did not display as much\r\ndiscretion in their dealings with these functionaries as they ought to\r\nhave done. At any rate, the Packetfahrt was so little satisfied with its\r\nparticipation in this Russian concern that it re-sold its rights to the\r\ninterested Copenhagen parties in 1906, not without incurring a\r\nconsiderable loss on the transaction. The West Indies agreement\r\nautomatically lapsed when the Packetfahrt acquired sole possession of\r\nthe four Danish steamers.\r\n\r\nLater on some sort of co-operation with the Russian company was brought\r\nabout once more by the admission of that company to the transatlantic\r\nsteerage pool. The Packetfahrt also had an opportunity of profiting from\r\nthe technical experience gained by the Danish East Asiatic Company,\r\nwhich was the first shipping concern to specialize in the use of\r\nmotor-ships. It was enabled to do so by the support it received from the\r\nshipbuilding firm of Messrs. Burmeister and Wain, of Copenhagen, who had\r\napplied the Diesel engine, a German invention, to the propulsion of\r\nships, and who subsequently built a fleet of excellent motor-ships for\r\nthe East Asiatic Company. One of these vessels was afterwards acquired\r\nby the Hamburg-Amerika Linie for studying purposes. The new type of\r\nvessel proved exceedingly remunerative during the war, as it made the\r\nowners independent of the supply of British bunker coal, and relieved\r\nthem of the numerous difficulties connected with obtaining it. This\r\ngreat practical success of the Danish shipbuilders became possible only\r\nbecause they applied themselves consistently to the development of one\r\nparticular type of engine, whereas in Germany endless experiments were\r\nmade with a great variety of different types which led to no tangible\r\nresults. It was only when the war came, and when the building of\r\nnumerous submarines became necessary that German engineering skill\r\nobtained a chance of showing what it could do, and then, indeed, it\r\nproved itself worthy of the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 war broke out between Russia and Japan, an event which exercised\r\nsuch an influence on the Packetfahrt that it is hardly an exaggeration\r\nto say that the rapid progress the company made during the next few\r\nyears amounted to a re-birth. The war provided the company with a chance\r\nto sell a large number of its units at a considerable rate of profit,\r\nand the contract concluded with the Russian Government for the coal\r\nsupply added enormously to its revenues. The Russian Government partly\r\nconverted the purchased steamers into auxiliary cruisers for the purpose\r\nof checking and disorganizing Japanese sea-borne trade, and it partly\r\nused them to accompany its Baltic fleet on its way to the Far East. As\r\nan illustration of the magnitude and the complexity of this transaction,\r\nit may be permitted to quote a few extracts from Ballin's notes\r\nreferring to it:\r\n\r\n\"_May, 1904._\r\n\r\n     \"Much though my time has been occupied by the Hungarian affair (the\r\n     competition of the Cunard Line in Hungary), and great though the\r\n     strain on my nerves has been on that account, I must say that much\r\n     bigger claims are made on my time and on my nerves by the\r\n     negotiations we are now carrying on with the Russian Government\r\n     concerning the sale of some of our steamers. On Christmas Day I\r\n     sent some representatives to Petrograd who were to approach the\r\n     government in case it intended to acquire any merchant vessels for\r\n     purposes of war. These gentlemen are still staying at Petrograd,\r\n     where they have been all the time with the exception of a few\r\n     weeks, and we have carried on some extremely difficult negotiations\r\n     by cable which so far have led to the definite sale of the _Fürst\r\n     Bismarck_ and the _Belgia_. The _Auguste Victoria_, which is still\r\n     in dock until the necessary repairs have been executed, has also\r\n     been sold to Russia, and the prospects that the _Columbia_ will\r\n     follow suit are extremely good.\r\n\r\n     \"The sales, of course, necessitate large alterations of the\r\n     existing schedules, and they lead to a great deal of inconvenience.\r\n     A particularly awkward situation has been brought about by the\r\n     circumstance that the _Fürst Bismarck_ has been chartered to the\r\n     firm of Thos. Cook and Sons for an excursion from Marseilles, in\r\n     which 500 members of a Sunday school are to take part, so that, in\r\n     order to release her, it has become necessary for the _Augusts\r\n     Victoria_ to interrupt her usual trip to the Near East, and for the\r\n     _Columbia_ to take her place....\r\n\r\n     \"Our big coal contract with the Russian Government has, in the\r\n     meantime, been considerably added to. The execution of the\r\n     contract, however, is causing me a great deal of anxiety, as the\r\n     English press, notably _The Times_, is only too glad to make use of\r\n     this circumstance as a pretext for rousing suspicions as to\r\n     Germany's neutrality. As our government is not taking up a very\r\n     firm attitude, the effect of these articles, of course, is highly\r\n     disagreeable. On Friday, September 23rd, I had an opportunity of\r\n     discussing this matter with the Imperial Chancellor at Homburg. The\r\n     Chancellor did not disguise the anxiety he felt concerning these\r\n     contracts, especially as he had just then received a long telegram\r\n     from the German Ambassador in Tokio advising him to proceed with\r\n     much caution. I told the Chancellor that he need not study in any\r\n     way the damage which our company might suffer; that we did not ask\r\n     that any regard should be paid to our business interests in case\r\n     these should clash with those of the country, and that, if the\r\n     Government were of opinion that the interests of the country\r\n     necessitated the cancelling of the whole agreement, I should be\r\n     glad to receive instructions from him to that effect. Failing such\r\n     instructions, of course, I was not entitled to cancel a contract\r\n     which was in every respect a properly drawn-up legal instrument. At\r\n     the same time I pointed out to the Chancellor that Germany, if he\r\n     thought that he had reason to adopt such an attitude, would run the\r\n     risk of offending both antagonists; for it was but reasonable to\r\n     expect that, owing to the agitation carried on by the British, no\r\n     action on Germany's part would cause a change of feeling in Japan,\r\n     but that it would be a fatal blow to Russia, whose Baltic fleet in\r\n     that case would simply be unable to reach the Far East.\r\n\r\n     \"From Frankfort I went to Berlin in order to discuss the question\r\n     of the coal contract with the Foreign Office, which the Chancellor\r\n     had requested me to do. I had a long conference with Richthofen....\r\n\r\n     \" ... _October 1st, 1904._ Meanwhile our negotiations with the\r\n     Russian Government have made good progress, and practically the\r\n     whole of my time is taken up with these transactions, which have\r\n     given us a very exciting time. They compel me to go to Berlin\r\n     pretty frequently, as I consider it both fair to the Foreign\r\n     Office and advisable in our own interests that the former should\r\n     always be fully informed of all the steps I am taking. Several of\r\n     our gentlemen are constantly travelling from Hamburg to Petrograd,\r\n     and conferences of our directors are held nearly every morning,\r\n     necessitated by the telegrams which arrive from Petrograd\r\n     practically every day. In order to be in a position to carry out\r\n     the coal contracts, we have been obliged to charter a large number\r\n     of steamers, so that at times as many as 80 of these are employed\r\n     in this Russian transaction. Besides the old express steamers and\r\n     the _Belgia_ we have now sold to the Russians the _Palatia_ and the\r\n     _Phoenicia_, as well as nine other boats of our company,\r\n     including the _Belgravia_, _Assyria_, and _Granada_ (the remaining\r\n     ones are cargo vessels, mostly taken out of the West Indies\r\n     service), but as regards these latter, we have reserved to\r\n     ourselves the right of redemption.... We have successfully\r\n     accomplished the great task we had undertaken, although, owing to\r\n     the absence of coaling stations, it was thought next to impossible\r\n     to convey such a huge squadron as was the Baltic fleet all the way\r\n     from European to Far Eastern waters. It safely reached its\r\n     destination, because the previously arranged coaling of the vessels\r\n     was carried out systematically and without a hitch anywhere,\r\n     although in some cases it had to be done in open roadsteads. Its\r\n     inglorious end in the Korea Straits cannot, and does not, diminish\r\n     the magnitude of the achievement; and the experiences we have\r\n     gained by successfully carrying out our novel task will surely\r\n     prove of great value to the Government. This whole coaling business\r\n     has been a source of considerable profits to our company, although\r\n     if due regard is paid to the exceptional character of the work and\r\n     to the unusual risks we had to run, they cannot be called\r\n     exorbitant.\"\r\n\r\nA few statistics will show what the whole undertaking meant to the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie from a business point of view. During the years\r\n1904 and 1905 the company increased its fleet by no less than 21\r\nsteamers--partly new buildings and partly new purchases--representing a\r\nvalue of 22-1/2 million marks. To these new acquisitions must be added\r\nthe 19 steamers then building, of a value of 52 million marks, amongst\r\nthem the two big passenger steamers _Amerika_ and _Kaiserin Auguste\r\nVictoria_ for the New York route, and other big boats for the Mexico,\r\nthe River Plate, and the Far East services. A large fraction of the sums\r\nspent on this new tonnage--viz. no less than 24 million\r\nmarks--represented the profits made on the sales of ships; another large\r\nportion was taken out of current earnings, and the remainder was secured\r\nby a debenture issue. Never again, except in 1913, has the company added\r\nsuch an amount of tonnage to its fleet in a single year as it did at\r\nthat time. But the \"re-birth\" of the company did not only consist in\r\nthis augmentation of tonnage, but also, and chiefly, in the entire\r\nreorganization of its New York service by the addition to its fleet of\r\nthe _Amerika_ and the _Kaiserin Auguste Victoria_. This event meant that\r\nthe era of the express steamers was being succeeded by one characterized\r\nby another type of vessel which, though possessing less speed, was\r\nmainly designed with a view to securing the utmost possible comfort to\r\nthe passengers. The two steamers proved exceedingly remunerative\r\ninvestments, and added enormously to the clientèle of the company. The\r\nprofits earned on the Russian transaction also made up to a large extent\r\nfor the losses incurred in the keen rate war with the Cunard Line then\r\nin progress. In spite of this rate war the company was able to increase\r\nits dividend to 9 per cent. in 1904, and to 11 per cent. in 1905.\r\n\r\nAnother event which took place in 1904 was the conclusion of a contract\r\nwith the German Government concerning the troop transports to German\r\nSouth-West Africa, and the year 1905 witnessed the settlement of a\r\nshort-lived conflict with the North German Lloyd. This conflict\r\nattracted a great deal of attention at the time, and the Kaiser himself\r\nthought fit to intervene with a view to terminating it.\r\n\r\nWhen it was seen that German commercial interests in the Middle East had\r\nconsiderably increased, the Hamburg-Amerika Linie opened a special line\r\nto the Persian Gulf in 1906. The year 1907 is chiefly remarkable for a\r\nrate war affecting the services from Hamburg to the West Coast of\r\nAfrica, of which until then the Woermann Line had considered itself\r\nentitled to claim a monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe African shipping business had been jealously nursed by its founder,\r\nAdolph Woermann, who had always tried hard to guard this special domain\r\nof his against the encroachments of all outsiders. However much Ballin\r\nand Adolph Woermann differed in character, they were akin to each other\r\nin one essential feature--viz. the jealous love they bore to the\r\nundertaking with which they had identified themselves. Both men, grown\r\nup in absolutely different environments, yet resembled each other in the\r\ndaring and the fearlessness with which they defended the interests of\r\ntheir businesses. The one had trained himself to employ moderation and\r\ncommonsense to overcome resistance where the use of forcible means\r\npromised no success; the other was a pioneer in the colonial sphere, a\r\nking in his African empire, the discoverer of new outlets, but broken in\r\nspirit and bereft of his strength when compelled by circumstances to\r\nshare with others. When Adolph Woermann had died, Ballin honoured his\r\nmemory by contributing to the public Press an appreciation of his\r\ncharacter, which is perhaps the best that has been written, and which\r\nought to be saved from being forgotten. This fact, it is hoped, will be\r\nsufficient justification for reproducing in this connexion a translation\r\nof Ballin's article:\r\n\r\n     \"The late Adolph Woermann was a man whom we may truly describe as\r\n     the ideal of what a Hanseatic citizen should be. Secretary of State\r\n     Dernburg himself once told me that he knew quite well that the work\r\n     he was doing for the benefit of our colonies would never come up to\r\n     what Adolph Woermann had achieved in the face of the greatest\r\n     imaginable difficulties.\r\n\r\n     \"Never before, perhaps, has any private shipowner displayed so much\r\n     daring as we see embodied in the business he has built up through\r\n     his labours. Woermann has developed the means of communication\r\n     between Germany and her African colonies to such perfection that\r\n     even the similar work performed by British shipping men has been\r\n     overshadowed. He has done this without receiving any aid from the\r\n     Government; in fact, he had to overcome all sorts of obstacles\r\n     which were put in his way by the bureaucracy. His confidence in his\r\n     work was not shaken when losses had to be faced. Then, more than\r\n     ever, he had his eyes firmly fixed on his goal; and practically\r\n     every vessel which he had built to facilitate communication between\r\n     the German mother country and her colonies represented a fresh step\r\n     forward towards a higher type, thus increasing the immense personal\r\n     responsibility with which he burdened himself. His patriotism was\r\n     of the practical kind; he did his work without asking for the help\r\n     of others, especially without that of the Government.\r\n\r\n     \"And now he has died in bitter disappointment. His striking outward\r\n     appearance has always reminded us of the Iron Chancellor, but the\r\n     similarity in the character of the two men has only become apparent\r\n     during the last few years. It is well known that when the troubles\r\n     in the colonies had been settled he was accused of having enriched\r\n     himself at the expense of the country. He never lost his resentment\r\n     of this accusation; and even though his accusers can point to the\r\n     fact that the court which had to investigate the claims put forward\r\n     by the Government gave judgment to the effect that some of these\r\n     claims were justified, it must be said in reply that this statement\r\n     of the case is inadequate and one-sided. All that was proved was\r\n     that Woermann, who hated red tape, and who never had recourse to\r\n     legal assistance when drawing up his agreements, did not use as\r\n     much caution in this matter as would have been advisable in his\r\n     own interest. The facts that have become known most clearly\r\n     disprove the accusation that he had made large profits at the\r\n     expense of the country, and that he had used the country's distress\r\n     to enrich himself. To the task of carrying out the troop transports\r\n     he devoted himself with his customary largeness of purpose, and he\r\n     accomplished it magnificently. In order to be able to do so, he had\r\n     enlarged his fleet by a number of steamers, and the consequence was\r\n     that, when the work was achieved, he had to admit himself that he\r\n     had over-estimated his strength. When my late colleague Dr.\r\n     Wiegand, the Director-General of the North German Lloyd, and I were\r\n     asked to express an expert opinion on the rates which Woermann had\r\n     charged the Government, we found them thoroughly moderate; in fact,\r\n     we added a rider to the effect that if either of our companies had\r\n     been entrusted with those transports, we could only have carried\r\n     out a very few expeditions at the rates charged by Woermann.\r\n     Woermann, however, carried through the whole task; and when it was\r\n     done he found himself compelled to pass on to the shoulders of the\r\n     Hamburg-Amerika Linie part of the excessive burden which he had\r\n     taken upon himself.\r\n\r\n     \"His iron determination would have enabled him to dispense with the\r\n     assistance thus obtained. But by that time his accusers had\r\n     commenced their attacks on his character, and when the Government\r\n     had officially taken up an attitude against him, he became a prey\r\n     to that resentment to which I have referred before. All those who\r\n     had the privilege of being associated with him during the past few\r\n     years must have noted with grief how this great patriot gradually\r\n     became an embittered critic. The heavy blow also led to the\r\n     breakdown of his health, and during the last years of his life we\r\n     only knew him as a sick man.\r\n\r\n     \"If it is borne in mind how strong, how masterful, and how\r\n     self-reliant a man has passed away with Adolph Woermann, it is sad\r\n     to think that in the end he was not strong enough after all to bear\r\n     on his own shoulders entirely the immense burden of responsibility\r\n     which he had taken upon himself, and that he received nothing but\r\n     ingratitude as the reward of his life's work, although he was\r\n     actuated by truly patriotic motives throughout. Still, this shall\r\n     not prevent us from acknowledging that he was the greatest, the\r\n     most daring, and the most self-sacrificing private shipowner whom\r\n     the Hanseatic cities have ever produced--a princely merchant if\r\n     ever there was one. He was a true friend and an earnest well-wisher\r\n     to the city in which he was born, and to the country which he\r\n     served as a statesman. We are sincerely grateful to him for the\r\n     work he has done, and in honouring his memory we know that we are\r\n     paying tribute to the greatest Hanseatic citizen who had been\r\n     living in our midst.\"\r\n\r\nTo complete the enumeration of the many rate wars which occurred during\r\nthe first decade of the twentieth century, we must make brief reference\r\nto the competition emanating in 1909 from the so-called \"Princes' Trust\"\r\n(Fürstenkonzern) and its ally, viz. a Hamburg firm which had already\r\nfought the Woermann Line. The object of the fight was to secure the\r\nbusiness from Antwerp to the Plate. The struggle ended with the\r\nacquisition of the shipping interests of the Princes' Trust, the\r\nbusiness career of which came to a sudden end shortly afterwards by a\r\nfinancial disaster causing enormous losses to the two princely families\r\nconcerned--the house of Hohenlohe and that of Fürstenberg. The details\r\nconnected with this affair are still in everybody's memory, and it would\r\nbe beyond the scope of this volume to enter into them. It should be\r\nmentioned, however, that in connexion with the settlement arrived at the\r\ntwo big companies undertook to start some transatlantic services from\r\nthe port of Emden, and in particular to establish a direct line for the\r\nsteerage traffic to North America. The necessary arrangements to this\r\nend had just been made when the war broke out, and further progress\r\nbecame impossible.\r\n\r\nThe transatlantic pool was considerably extended in scope during those\r\nyears. More than once, however, after the rate war with the Cunard Line\r\nhad come to an end, the amicable relations existing between the lines\r\nwere disturbed, e.g. when the Russian Volunteer Fleet opened a competing\r\nservice--a competition which was got rid of by the aid of the Russian\r\nEast Asiatic S.S. Company; when some British lines temporarily withdrew\r\nfrom the steerage pool, and when some differences of policy arose\r\nbetween the Hamburg-Amerika Linie and the North German Lloyd. The\r\nHamburg company demanded a revision of the percentages, contending that\r\nthe arrangements made fifteen years ago no longer did justice to the\r\nentirely altered relative positions of the two companies. The\r\ndiscussions held in London in February, 1908, under Ballin's\r\nchairmanship, which lasted several days, and in which delegates of all\r\nthe big Continental and British lines, as well as of the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway Company took part, led to the formation of the Atlantic\r\nConference (also known as the General Pool). It was supplemented in the\r\nfollowing year by that of the Mediterranean Conference. Both these\r\nagreements were renewed in 1911, and further agreements were concluded\r\nwith the Russian and Scandinavian lines to complete the system.\r\nAgreements on so large a scale had never before been concluded between\r\nany shipping companies.\r\n\r\nThis network of agreements existed until it was destroyed through the\r\noutbreak of the war.\r\n\r\nDuring the fluctuating conditions which characterized the shipping\r\nbusiness of those years the year 1908 witnessed a depression which, in\r\nits after-effects, is comparable only to that caused by the cholera\r\nepidemic sixteen years earlier. Business had been excellent for a fairly\r\nlong time, but it became thoroughly demoralized in the second half of\r\n1907, and an economic crisis of a magnitude such as has seldom been\r\nexperienced began to affect every country. No part of the shipping\r\nbusiness remained unaffected by it; hundreds and hundreds of\r\nocean-going liners lay idle in the seaports of the world.\r\n\r\nVery gradually prospects began to brighten up in the course of 1908, so\r\nthat the worst of the depression had passed sooner than had been\r\nexpected. Indeed, in one respect the crisis had proved a blessing in\r\ndisguise, inasmuch as it had strengthened the inclination of the\r\nshipping concerns everywhere to compromise and to eliminate unnecessary\r\ncompetition--the formation of the general pool, in fact, being the\r\noutcome of that feeling. The subsequent recovery made up for the losses;\r\nand the succeeding years, with their very gratifying financial results,\r\nand their vast internal consolidation, represent the high-water mark in\r\nthe development of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie.\r\n\r\nShortly after the end of the depression a renewed spell of building\r\nactivity set in. First of all a new cargo steamer, possessing a burden\r\nof 12,000 tons--which was something quite unusual at the time--was\r\nordered to be built by Messrs. Harland and Wolff, at a price which was\r\nalso unusually low. It almost created a record for cheapness; and the\r\ncourage of the builders who accepted such an order at such terms was\r\ngreatly admired. A German yard--the Vulkan, of Bremen--then came forward\r\nwith a similar offer, because the German shipbuilders, too, were glad to\r\nprovide their men with work. The result of the combined labour of both\r\nthese firms was a type of cargo boat which proved extremely useful,\r\nespecially in the Far Eastern trade, and which represented a good\r\ninvestment to the company.\r\n\r\nGradually the other branches of the business began to increase their\r\nactivity, and the service to North America especially received the close\r\nattention of the company's management. Meanwhile, other shipping\r\ncompanies had added some vessels of the very highest class to their\r\nfleets. The two big turbine steamers of the Cunard Line, the\r\n_Lusitania_ and the _Mauretania_, had attracted many passengers, and the\r\nWhite Star Line had the mammoth liner _Olympic_ building, which was to\r\nbe followed by two others of the same type, the _Titanic_ and the\r\n_Gigantic_. The new Cunarder, the _Aquitania_, was to be of the same\r\ntype, so that once more the public was offered the choice of steamers of\r\na kind unknown until then. This competition compelled the Packetfahrt to\r\nfollow suit, and Ballin commenced to evolve plans for the building of a\r\nnew vessel which, of course, had to surpass the highest achievement of\r\nthe competing lines, i.e. the _Olympic_. Thus, in co-operation with the\r\nVulkan yard, of Stettin, and with Messrs. Blohm and Voss, of Hamburg,\r\nthe plans for the three steamers of the \"Imperator\" class were designed.\r\nThe competition among the various yards had been extremely keen, and the\r\nVulkan yard secured the order for the building of the first unit of this\r\nclass, the _Imperator_. From the point of view of speed, these new\r\nvessels resembled the fast steamers of the older kind; with regard to\r\ntheir equipment, they represented a combination of this type and that of\r\nthe _Kaiserin_, but from the business point of view they were quite a\r\nnovelty, as the basis of their remunerativeness was no longer the cargo\r\nand steerage business, but the cabin business. If the booking of a\r\ncertain number of cabins could be relied on for each voyage an adequate\r\nreturn would be assured. Everything, therefore, was done to attract as\r\nmany cabin passengers as possible. These vessels were a triumph of\r\nGerman shipbuilding and engineering skill; and the senior partner of\r\nMessrs. Blohm and Voss, when the _Vaterland_ was launched, stated with\r\njust pride that she was the biggest vessel in existence; that she was\r\nbuilt on the biggest slip; that she had received her equipment under the\r\nbiggest crane, and that she would be docked in the biggest floating dock\r\nin the world. The launching of the third and biggest of the three\r\nsteamers, the _Bismarck_, represented a red-letter day in the life of\r\nBallin and in the history of the company. Nominally she was christened\r\nby the granddaughter of the Iron Chancellor, but actually by the Kaiser.\r\nThe bottle of champagne used for the purpose did not break when it left\r\nthe young lady's hands; but the Kaiser seized it, and with a sweeping\r\nmovement of the arm hurled it against the stem of the huge vessel. To\r\nremove as far as possible the last vestige of the unhappy estrangement\r\nbetween the Kaiser and the Chancellor had always been Ballin's earnest\r\ndesire. So it filled him with great joy when he was enabled to dedicate\r\nthe greatest product of his life-work to the memory of the Prince whom\r\nhe admired intensely; and still more was he pleased when the Kaiser\r\nconsented to take part in the ceremony. He had often expressed his\r\nregret at the unfortunate stage management in connexion with the\r\nKaiser's visit to Hamburg after the unveiling of the Bismarck monument,\r\nwhen he was driven past it without an opportunity having been arranged\r\nfor him to inspect it. Such a course, Ballin remarked, was bound to\r\ncreate the impression that the Kaiser had intentionally been led past\r\nit. \"I wish I had been permitted to speak to the Kaiser about it\r\nbeforehand,\" he told me afterwards. \"I am sure he would have insisted\r\nupon seeing it.\" Proper stage management plays so prominent a part in\r\nthe life of royalty, and it can be of such great use in avoiding certain\r\nblunders and in hiding certain shortcomings that it is much to be\r\nregretted that the Kaiser had so often to dispense with it.\r\n\r\nThe entering into the Packetfahrt's service of the \"Imperator\" type of\r\nsteamers represented an extraordinary increase in the amount of tonnage\r\nwhich the company employed on the New York route; and when the North\r\nGerman Lloyd refused to allow the Packetfahrt a corresponding addition\r\nto its percentage share under the pool agreement, which the Packetfahrt\r\nbelieved itself justified in asking for, a conflict threatened once more\r\nto disturb the relations existing between the two companies. As a result\r\nthe position of both was weakened in Austria, where the Government\r\ncleverly used the situation to its own advantage. Apart from this,\r\nhowever, not much damage was done, as negotiations were soon started\r\nwith the object of securing the conclusion of a far-reaching community\r\nof interest agreement which was not merely to be restricted to the\r\ntransatlantic services of the two companies. If these negotiations could\r\nbe brought to a successful issue, Ballin thought that this would be the\r\ndawn of a new era in the contractual relations existing between shipping\r\nfirms everywhere, because he believed that such development would not be\r\nconfined to the German lines, but would assume international\r\nproportions. The agreements actually in force seemed to him obsolete--at\r\nleast in part. That this should be so is but natural, as the factor\r\nwhich it is intended to eliminate by the terms of such agreements--man's\r\ninnate selfishness--is, after all, ineradicable. \"Nature,\" in the words\r\nof the Roman poet, \"will always return, even if you expel it with a\r\npitchfork.\" Wherever a human trait like selfishness is to be kept within\r\ncertain bounds by means of written agreements, it becomes necessary not\r\nonly to make small improvements from time to time, but to subject the\r\nwhole system to a thorough overhauling every now and then.\r\n\r\nMany events affecting the progress of the company's business have no\r\nreference in these pages, but the reader can visualize the importance of\r\nAlbert Ballin's life-work if he keeps before his mind the fact that\r\nwhile in the early part of 1886 the Hamburg-Amerika Linie maintained but\r\na mail service from Hamburg to New York and four lines to Mexico and\r\nthe West Indies, from that date to 1913 fifty new services were added to\r\nthe existing ones.\r\n\r\nThe fleet possessed by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie in 1886 consisted of 22\r\nocean-going steamers, totalling 60,531 G.R.T.[1] By the end of 1913\r\nthese figures had increased to 172 steamers and 1,028,762 G.R.T.\r\nrespectively. During the twenty-eight years 269 vessels of 1,388,206\r\ntons had been added, either by new building or by purchase, and 101\r\nsteamers of 346,927 tons had been sold. At the end of 1913 19 steamers\r\nof 268,766 tons were building, so that, including these, the total\r\ntonnage amounted to 1,360,360 G.R.T. at that date.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the joint-stock capital of the company had\r\nincreased from 15 to 157-1/2 million marks, the debenture issues from\r\n5·6 to 69·5 million marks, and the visible reserves from 3,595,285 to\r\n58,856,552 marks.\r\n\r\nThe working profits of the company during those twenty-eight years\r\namounted to 521,727,426 marks, 2,735,700 of which were Government\r\nsubsidies received during the temporary participation in the Imperial\r\nMail Service to the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe average dividend paid to the shareholders was 7·02 per cent. per\r\nannum. This figure, to my thinking, proves that the biggest steamship\r\ncompany the world has ever known was to a small extent only a\r\n\"capitalist enterprise.\" Out of a total net profit of over 500 millions,\r\nno more than 140 million marks went to the shareholders as interest on\r\ntheir invested capital; by far the greater part of the remainder was\r\nused to extend the company's business, so that the country in general\r\nbenefited by it.\r\n\r\nConcerning one matter which played an important part in Ballin's career,\r\nviz., the relations between his company and the North German Lloyd, the\r\nreader may perhaps desire a more exhaustive account. There certainly\r\nwas no want of rivalry between the two companies. One notable reason for\r\nthis was the fact that at the time when Ballin joined the Packetfahrt\r\nthe latter had fallen far behind its younger competitor in its\r\ndevelopment, both from the business and the technical point of view. The\r\nPacketfahrt, in particular, had not kept pace with the technical\r\nprogress in steamship construction, and the consequence was that, when\r\nthe pool was set up, it had to content itself with a percentage which\r\nwas considerably less than that allotted to the Lloyd. The enormous\r\nadvance made under the Ballin régime naturally caused it to demand a\r\nlarger share. At the same time the Lloyd also increased its efforts more\r\nthan ever before, and thus a race for predominance was started between\r\nthe two big companies, which greatly assisted them in obtaining the\r\ncommanding position they acquired as the world's leading shipping firms.\r\nI do not think this is the place to go into all the details of this\r\nstruggle, and I shall confine myself to reproducing an article which\r\nBallin himself contributed in 1907 on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the foundation of the North German Lloyd. As this article\r\nthrows several interesting sidelights on the development of\r\ntransatlantic shipping enterprise, it may furnish a suitable conclusion\r\nto the account given in the present chapter:\r\n\r\n     \"The year 1907 is one which will stand out prominently in the\r\n     history of our transatlantic shipping on account of the two\r\n     anniversaries which we are going to celebrate during its course. On\r\n     May 27th it will be sixty years since the Hamburg-Amerika Linie was\r\n     called into existence, and on February 20th the North German Lloyd\r\n     will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation. I\r\n     suppose that a more competent pen than mine will present us on that\r\n     day with a detailed account of the development of the great Bremen\r\n     shipping firm, and my only object in writing this article is to\r\n     review in brief the period of more than twenty years during which I\r\n     have had the pleasure of working hand in hand with our Bremen\r\n     friends.\r\n\r\n     \"Until the year 1885 the two big companies, the Lloyd and the\r\n     Packetfahrt, scarcely had any mutually profitable dealings with\r\n     each other; on the contrary, their relations were characterized by\r\n     open enmity. It is true that the attempts at a _rapprochement_,\r\n     which were made from time to time, did in some cases lead to the\r\n     conclusion of an agreement concerning certain rates to which both\r\n     companies bound themselves to adhere, but they never lasted more\r\n     than a short time, and ultimately, far from causing an improvement\r\n     of the existing state of things, they left matters worse than they\r\n     had been before. I think I may congratulate myself on being the\r\n     first to have brought about a better understanding between the two\r\n     companies which, in the end, paved the way to the establishment of\r\n     a lasting friendship which has grown closer and closer during the\r\n     past twenty years.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1886, shortly after I had joined the Hamburg-Amerika Linie,\r\n     when I went to Bremen in order to find out what could be done to\r\n     lessen or, if possible, to remove altogether the competition\r\n     between both companies, the conduct of the firm's business had\r\n     passed from the hands of Consul Meier, who was getting on in years,\r\n     into those of Director Lohmann. Mr. Lohmann was a man of unusual\r\n     energy and possessed of a rare gift for organization. In the annals\r\n     of international shipping his name will be for ever associated with\r\n     the introduction into the North Atlantic route of fast steamers\r\n     under the German flag. He had been fortunate enough to meet with a\r\n     congenial mind on the technical side in the head of the firm of\r\n     Messrs. John Elder and Co., the Glasgow shipbuilders. At their\r\n     yard, starting in 1881, a series of fast steamers were built--the\r\n     _Elbe_, the _Werra_, the _Fulda_, the _Saale_, the _Trave_, the\r\n     _Aller_, and the _Lahn_--which opened up a new and memorable era in\r\n     the progress of the means of communication between the Old World\r\n     and the New. These boats proved of great benefit to the company\r\n     financially, and they were also a considerable boon to the\r\n     passengers owing to their speed and punctuality. I recollect\r\n     talking to the chairman of a big British steamship company on\r\n     board one of his steamers in New York harbour in 1888, when the\r\n     s.s. _Lahn_, of the North German Lloyd, steamed in. My British\r\n     colleague, filled with admiration, glanced at his watch, touched\r\n     his hat by way of salutation, and said with honest enthusiasm:\r\n     'Wonderful boats; they are really doing clockwork.' He only\r\n     expressed the sentiment felt by the travelling public generally;\r\n     everybody appreciated their reliability and punctuality, and the\r\n     excellence of their service.\r\n\r\n     \"Director Lohmann died very suddenly on February 9th, 1892; he had\r\n     just concluded an address at a general meeting of the company held\r\n     at the 'Haus Seefahrt' when he dropped down dead. During the last\r\n     few years of his life he had not been well advised technically, and\r\n     failed to adopt the twin-screw principle, as had been done by the\r\n     Hamburg company. Thus, when the two fast single-screw steamers, the\r\n     _Havel_ and the _Spree_, were built at Stettin in 1890, they were\r\n     practically obsolete, because the travelling public by that time\r\n     had come to prefer those of the twin-screw type, owing to the\r\n     increased safety they afforded.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1888 Consul Meier retired from the chairmanship of the Lloyd,\r\n     to be succeeded--after the short reign of Mr. Reck--by Mr. George\r\n     Plate. To Mr. Plate, if I am rightly informed, great credit is due\r\n     for having secured the services of Director-General Dr. Heinrich\r\n     Wiegand on the board of the company.\r\n\r\n     \"What the Lloyd has achieved under the Wiegand régime far surpasses\r\n     anything accomplished in the past.\r\n\r\n     \"The Hamburg-Amerika Linie, meanwhile, had been alive to the needs\r\n     of the times; and the consequence was a healthy competition between\r\n     these two steamship companies--by far the biggest the world has\r\n     ever seen--practically on all the seven seas. This competition, by\r\n     intelligent compromise, was restricted within reasonable limits,\r\n     the guiding spirits of the two concerns consciously adopting the\r\n     policy implied by the strategic principle: 'In approaching the\r\n     enemy's position we must divide our forces; in attacking him we\r\n     must concentrate them.'\r\n\r\n     \"It would not be correct to say that this atmosphere of friendship\r\n     had never been clouded--it would, indeed, have been tedious had it\r\n     been otherwise than it was. Up to now, however, Wiegand and I have\r\n     always been able to maintain pleasant relations between our two\r\n     concerns, and in the interests of both of them it is sincerely to\r\n     be hoped that this spirit of mutual understanding will continue to\r\n     animate them in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNICAL REORGANIZATION OF THE HAMBURG-AMERIKA LINIE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another chapter of this book the big passenger boats of the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie have been described as the outcome of Ballin's\r\nimaginative brain. This they were indeed, and in many instances it is\r\nscarcely possible to say how far the credit for having built them is due\r\nto the naval architect, and how far it is due to Ballin. He was\r\nprofoundly against employing _one_ system throughout, and on accepting\r\nthe views of _one_ expert exclusively; and this aversion was so\r\npronounced that he objected on principle to the nomination of any\r\ntechnical expert to the Board of his company. The company, he said, is\r\nsurely going to last longer than a lifetime or two. Besides, it must try\r\nto solve the problem of perpetual youth, and therefore it cannot afford\r\nto run the risk of staking its fortune on the views held by one single\r\nman who is apt to ignore the progress of his science without noticing\r\nit. The same dislike of onesidedness induced him to encourage to the\r\nbest of his capacity a healthy competition among the various shipyards,\r\nand to avail himself of the experiences gained not only by the German\r\nyards but by their British rivals also. At an early stage of his career\r\nclose business relations were established between himself and Messrs.\r\nHarland and Wolff, of Belfast; and a personal friendship connected him\r\nwith the owner of that firm, Mr. (now Lord) Pirrie. Acting upon the\r\nexample set by the White Star Line, Ballin made an agreement with\r\nMessrs. Harland and Wolff as early as 1898, by which the latter bound\r\nthemselves always to keep a slip at the disposal of the Packetfahrt. The\r\nreason which prompted Ballin to make this arrangement was, as he\r\nexplained to the Board of Trustees, that the company's orders for new\r\nconstruction and repairs had nowhere been carried out more\r\nsatisfactorily and more cheaply than by the Belfast yard, where all the\r\nnew vessels ordered were built under a special agreement, i.e. at cost\r\nprice with a definitely fixed additional percentage representing the\r\nprofits and certain expenditure incurred by the builders. This\r\narrangement enabled the Packetfahrt to become acquainted with whatever\r\nwas latest and best in British shipyard production, and, as it were, to\r\nacquire models which it could improve upon in German yards after they\r\nhad been tested on actual service. Some of the best and most important\r\ntypes of vessels which the Packetfahrt has produced owe their origin to\r\nthis system; and it is only fair to say that it exercised an entirely\r\nbeneficial influence on the progress of the German shipbuilding\r\nindustry, the prosperity of which is largely due to the fact that it has\r\nprofited from the century-old experience gained by the British yards and\r\nby British ocean-shipping.\r\n\r\nBallin held the view that, just as the shipbuilding expert had to watch\r\nthe progress of naval architecture and to make practical application of\r\nits results, and just as the merchant had to exploit this progress for\r\nthe benefit of his business, the shipowner--especially the one who\r\nmaintains a service of passenger boats--has the special task of making\r\nevery step in the direction of further advance serviceable to the needs\r\nof the passengers. Being himself, as has been pointed out elsewhere,\r\ngifted with a strong faculty for appreciating things beautiful, and\r\nraising no less high demands as regards the beauty and the comfort of\r\nall his surroundings, Ballin constantly endeavoured to make use of all\r\nthe results of his own observations and of his own experience for the\r\ngreater comfort of the passengers. Those who saw the finished products\r\nof his imagination, the beautifully appointed \"floating hotels,\" hardly\r\nrealized how many apparently insignificant details--which, after all, in\r\ntheir entirety make what we call comfort--owe their origin to his own\r\npersonal suggestions. Each time he made a sea voyage on board a steamer\r\nof his own, or of some other company, he brought home with him a number\r\nof new ideas, chiefly such as affected technicalities, and matters\r\ndealing with the personal comfort of the passengers. Numerous entries in\r\nthe notebooks which he carried on such occasions are there to serve as\r\nillustrations; the following items, for instance, are selected from\r\nthose which he jotted down, roughly, on a voyage to New York some time\r\nin the 'nineties. They speak for themselves, in spite of their\r\nsketchiness:\r\n\r\n\"List of Moselle purveyors wants revision--notices on board to be\r\nrestricted as much as possible, those which are necessary to be\r\ntastefully framed--sailing lists and general regulations to be included\r\nin passengers' lists--state cabin on board _Kaiser Friedrich_: key,\r\nlatch, drawer; no room for portmanteaux and trunks; towels too\r\nsmall--_Deutschland_: soiled linen cupboard too small--stewards\r\n_Oceanic_ white jackets--celery glasses--butter dishes too small--large\r\nbed pillows--consommé cups--playing cards: Packetfahrt complete name of\r\nfirm--Packetfahrt complete name on Wehber's wine bottles--toast to be\r\nserved in a serviette (hot).\"\r\n\r\nRough notes such as these were used to serve Ballin as the material\r\nunderlying the detailed reports and instructions to the company's\r\nservants which he composed during the voyage, so that not even a long\r\nsea voyage gave him the unbroken spell of leisure he so badly needed.\r\nIndeed, the longer it lasted the more chances did it provide for\r\nthoroughly inspecting the practical working of the steamer. Many other\r\nreports are in my possession, but the one given will serve to emphasize\r\nthe meticulous quality of observation he possessed, and how practical\r\nwas his mind in regard to details of comfort and convenience, and the\r\nspecial climatic needs of different routes.\r\n\r\nEven where the peculiar conditions obtaining in tropical climates were\r\nconcerned--conditions with which he was personally quite\r\nunacquainted--he unfailingly discovered any defects that might exist,\r\nand also the means by which they could be remedied.\r\n\r\nBallin's connexion with the Packetfahrt practically coincides with the\r\nwhole of that period during which the immense progress of modern\r\nsteamship building from humble beginnings to its present stage of\r\ndevelopment took place; with the only exception that the North German\r\nLloyd had already, before Ballin joined the Packetfahrt, established its\r\nservices of fast steamers which were far ahead of those maintained by\r\nother shipping companies owing to their punctuality and reliability, and\r\nwhich Ballin then set himself to improve upon and to excel. Apart from\r\nthis one type of vessel, the science of steamship construction, as seen\r\nfrom our modern point of view, was still in its infancy.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the steamships owned by the Hamburg-Amerika Linie were mainly of\r\ntwo different types, viz., those used in the North Atlantic service\r\n(principally on the New York route), and those used in the Mexico-West\r\nIndies service.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the Packetfahrt's business after Ballin had joined the\r\ncompany, and especially the addition of new services together with the\r\nincrease in the number of ports of departure and of destination, made it\r\nnecessary constantly to increase the size and the carrying capacity of\r\nthe cargo boats, and the size and the speed of the passenger steamers,\r\nas well as to improve and to modernize the passenger accommodation on\r\nboard the latter. All this, of course, considerably added to the cost\r\nprice of the vessels, so that, as a further consequence, the facilities\r\nfor loading and discharging them had to be improved and extended. Four\r\nprincipal types of steamers may be distinguished in the development of\r\nthe company's fleet, especially of that part of it which was engaged on\r\nthe North Atlantic route, where the main development took place.\r\n\r\n_Type One_: Fast steamers--twin screws, 18 knots, 8,500\r\nG.R.T.--possessing accommodation for passengers of all classes and\r\nprovided with comparatively little cargo space, but comfortably and\r\nluxuriously appointed throughout. The three leading ideas governing\r\ntheir construction were safety, speed, and comfort; and progress was\r\nmade to keep abreast of competing lines, until it culminated in the\r\nvessels of the \"Imperator\" class. The _Imperator_ was built in 1913.\r\nThey were quadruple screw turbine steamers, possessing no fewer than 42\r\nmultitubular boilers each, and, as they were of a capacity of 52,000\r\ngross register tons, they were nearly three times the size of the\r\n_Deutschland_.\r\n\r\n_Type Two_: Ships of medium speed and of considerable size, and\r\ntherefore providing a high standard of comfort for passengers combined\r\nwith ample facilities for cargo accommodation.\r\n\r\n_Type Three_: Chiefly built as cargo boats, but in such a way that a\r\npart of their space could be utilized for the accommodation of a large\r\nnumber of steerage passengers.\r\n\r\n_Type Four_: Cargo steamers without any passenger accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the floating palaces of type No. 1 in 1913 and\r\nthose vessels which the Hamburg-Amerika Linie possessed when Ballin\r\nfirst entered upon his career as a shipping man was like that between\r\nday and night. A brief comparison of a few details will be the best\r\nmeans of illustrating the enormous progress achieved within less than\r\nthe lifetime of a generation. The size of the vessels had increased from\r\n3,000 to more than 50,000 tons; the speed from 14 to nearly 25 knots;\r\nthe height of the decks from 6-1/2 to 8 feet in the lower decks, whilst\r\nthat of the upper ones, as far as the social rooms were concerned,\r\namounted to as much as 20 feet. Large portions of the upper decks were\r\nreserved for the social rooms, the finest of which--the ball-room--could\r\nchallenge comparison with almost any similar room in any hotel ashore\r\nwith respect to its size and to the magnificence of its furnishings and\r\nof its decoration. From a technical point of view, too, the construction\r\nof such a huge room on board a vessel, which possessed a floor space of\r\n4,800 square feet, and a ceiling unsupported by any columns or pillars\r\nof any kind, was an unprecedented achievement. Besides, there were\r\nimmense dining-rooms for each class, smoking-rooms, ladies' saloons, a\r\nrestaurant, a winter garden, a swimming pool, and numerous smaller rooms\r\nsuitable for the relaxation and amusement of the passengers.\r\n\r\nOn the older boats the arrangement was that the small cabins were all\r\ngrouped round the one and only social room on board, so that the\r\noccupants of the cabins could hear all that was going on in the social\r\nroom, and _vice versa_. The superficial area at the disposal of each\r\npassenger was gradually increased from 43 square feet in the double\r\ncabins to 172 square feet in the cabins of the _Imperator_, so that the\r\nlatter were really no longer mere cabins, but actual rooms. The\r\nsuites-de-luxe comprised up to twelve rooms, the largest of which\r\ncovered an area of 247 square feet.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that the first-class passengers were\r\nthe only ones for whose comfort the company catered. The other classes\r\nprogressed proportionately in added comfort, space, and social\r\nfacilities, not excepting the steerage.\r\n\r\nBut by far the greatest improvements made were those in connexion with\r\nthe enormous progress of the purely technical side of shipbuilding\r\nduring the whole period under review. The more the vessels increased in\r\nsize, the less were they liable to the pitching and rolling motion\r\ncaused when the weather was rough. Moreover, special appliances, such as\r\nbilge keels and bilge tanks, were employed to lessen these movements\r\nstill more, even when the sea was high. The reciprocating engines\r\ngradually gave place to higher types, and later on turbines and\r\noil-engines were also introduced. In addition to the propelling\r\nmachinery a number of auxiliary engines were used which were of various\r\nkinds and for various purposes, such as the ventilation of the cabins\r\nand the other rooms, the generation of light, the services in connexion\r\nwith the personal welfare of the passengers and with their safety whilst\r\non board ship. Instead of single bottoms, double bottoms were used, and\r\nthe additional safety resulting therefrom was still further enhanced by\r\ndividing the space between the two by means of a whole network of\r\npartitions. The vessels of the \"Imperator\" class, indeed, possessed\r\npractically a double shell, which formed an effective protection against\r\nthe danger of collision. The lifeboats increased in size and in number,\r\nand their shape and equipment were improved. Emergency lighting stations\r\nwere arranged which could generate a sufficient amount of electric\r\ncurrent if the ordinary supply should break down at any time. The whole\r\nvessels were divided into self-contained compartments by water-tight\r\nbulkheads, the doors of which could be automatically closed. This\r\ndivision into many compartments proved an effective protection against\r\nthe risk of fire; but a number of special devices were also adopted to\r\nserve the same purpose, e.g. an extensive system of steampipes by which\r\neach single room could be rapidly filled with steam, so that the fire\r\ncould be automatically extinguished. Fire-proof material was used for\r\nthe walls separating adjacent rooms and cabins, and, not content with\r\nall this, the company provided its mammoth liners with an actual fire\r\nbrigade, the members of which were fully trained for their work. The\r\nmost important improvements affecting the navigation of the steamers\r\nwere the introduction of wireless telegraphy apparatus, the gyroscopic\r\ncompasses, the system of submarine direction indicator signalling, and\r\nthe substitution of two steering gears instead of one, not to mention a\r\nseries of minor improvements of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThe provisioning on board the German steamers was of proverbial\r\nexcellence, the kitchen arrangements were modelled after those found in\r\nthe big hotels, and were supplied with all manner of supplementary\r\ndevices. The huge store rooms were divided into sections for those\r\nprovisions that were of a perishable nature and for those that were not;\r\nand for the former refrigerating rooms were also provided in which the\r\ntemperature could be regulated according to the nature of the articles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting development of the various types of\r\nsteamers is that which type No. 2 has undergone. It originated in Great\r\nBritain, whence it was taken over in 1894. The first unit of this type\r\nadded to the fleet of the Packetfahrt was the _Persia_, of 5,800 G.R.T.,\r\nand a speed of 12 knots, built to accommodate a number of cabin and\r\nsteerage passengers, and to carry a considerable amount of cargo as\r\nwell. These boats possessed many advantages over similar ones,\r\nadvantages which were due to their size, their shape, and the loading\r\nfacilities with which they were equipped. Ballin immediately recognized\r\nthe good points of this type, and he improved it until the vessels\r\nreached a size of 13,000 G.R.T., which still enabled them to travel at a\r\nspeed of 13 knots. They were twin-screw steamers, and were provided with\r\nevery safety device known at the time. A still further improvement of\r\nthis type was represented by the _Amerika_ and the _Kaiserin Auguste\r\nVictoria_, built in 1905 and 1906 respectively, luxuriously equipped\r\nthroughout; by their large size--they possessed a capacity of very\r\nnearly 25,000 G.R.T.--extremely seaworthy, and as they could travel at\r\nthe rate of 17-1/2 knots, their speed was scarcely inferior to that\r\npossessed by the older type of fast steamers. From the point of view of\r\nactual remunerativeness they were far superior to the fast steamers,\r\ncombining, as they did, all the earning possibilities of the passenger\r\nand of the cargo vessels.\r\n\r\nThe development of the types comprising the cargo steamers went hand in\r\nhand with the expansion of international trade relations, and with the\r\nconstant increase in the amount of goods exchanged between the nations.\r\nTo a certain extent development was limited by the dimensions of the\r\nSuez Canal. Still, improvements became possible in this respect too when\r\nthe depth of the Canal was increased to 27 feet in 1908, 29 feet in\r\n1912, and 30 feet in 1914.\r\n\r\nBallin carefully watched this development, incessantly improving the\r\nexisting types of his company's cargo boats, so that they should always\r\nmeet the growing needs of sea-borne trade, and in some instances even\r\nanticipating them, until, when the war broke out, twin screw cargo boats\r\nof a capacity of 16,000 tons and possessing a speed of 13 knots were\r\nbeing built for the company.\r\n\r\nIn a brief outline such as this, it is not possible to enter into\r\ndetails concerning the expansion of the other lines which became\r\naffiliated to or otherwise associated with the Packetfahrt in course of\r\ntime. One special type, however, ought to receive a somewhat more\r\ndetailed treatment in this connexion, viz., that of the excursion\r\nsteamers. The running of pleasure cruises, originally nothing but a mere\r\nexpedient to prevent the express steamers from lying idle during the\r\ndead season, gradually became an end in itself. The Northern and\r\nMediterranean cruises were soon followed by others, e.g. those to the\r\nWest Indies and the pleasure trips round the globe. Two special\r\nsteamers, the _Prinzessin Victoria Luise_, and the somewhat smaller and\r\nless sumptuous _Meteor_, both of them equipped after the style of\r\npleasure yachts, were built when it was found advisable to make this\r\nservice independent of the fast steamers and the big passenger boats\r\nwhich had also been employed for this purpose. After the loss of the\r\n_Prinzessin Victoria Luise_ she was replaced first by a British\r\npassenger boat that had been purchased, and then by the _Deutschland_,\r\nspecially reconditioned for her new purpose, and renamed _Victoria\r\nLuise_. Both vessels were extremely popular with the international\r\ntravelling public, and year after year they carried thousands of\r\ntourists to countries and places distinguished for the beauty of their\r\nnatural scenery or for their historical and artistic associations. They\r\nwere largely instrumental in constantly augmenting the number of those\r\nwho formed the regular clientèle of the company.\r\n\r\n\"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\" In the realm of shipping\r\nit has always been customary for each company to profit by the\r\nexperience gained and the progress made by its competitors. This applies\r\nto the Packetfahrt and its management also; but in their case they have\r\ngiven infinitely more than they have received, and in the whole history\r\nof shipping there has never been one single person who has exercised a\r\nmore stimulating influence on its technical progress than Albert\r\nBallin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many business controversies in which Ballin took an\r\nimportant part, it has occasionally been said that he was not really a\r\n\"fighter.\" This statement may be allowed to pass quite unchallenged,\r\nprovided that by the term \"fighter\" we mean a man whose habit it is to\r\nfight to the bitter end. Ballin never indulged in fighting for its own\r\nsake, nor was it ever his object to see his vanquished opponent lie\r\nprostrate before him. Such a mental attitude he, in his own drastic way,\r\nwould have described as a \"perverted pleasure.\" Always and everywhere it\r\nwas his aim to secure to himself and to those he represented the maximum\r\nbenefit obtainable consistent with the realities of the situation, so\r\nthat he has been justly described as \"a man of compromise.\"\r\n\r\nThis feature of his personality, indeed, forms the key-note both to his\r\npolicy and to the principles on which it was based. Perhaps in other\r\nspheres of economic activity it is possible for a struggle between two\r\ncompeting rivals to end in the complete victory of one of them; in the\r\nshipping business such an outcome is the exception but not the rule.\r\nThere a really _weak_ opponent is never met with, unless one's rival\r\nhappens to be exceptionally inexperienced or constitutionally unsound.\r\nThe minor competitor, where shipping is concerned, is by no means always\r\nthe less powerful of the two. On the contrary, the contest which\r\ninflicts small losses on him inflicts heavy losses on his big opponent,\r\nand may easily exhaust the latter first. The last few decades have\r\nwitnessed the establishment of many new shipping firms under the\r\nauspices of national sentiment. Governments and whole peoples have\r\nbacked them, and in such cases private undertakings have found it\r\ndifficult to compete.\r\n\r\nDuring his early training Ballin had so thoroughly convinced himself of\r\nthe necessity for co-operation and compromise in matters economic that\r\nthis conviction became the corner-stone of his policy. He also made it\r\nhis principle never to tie an unwilling partner to an agreement which\r\nthe latter considered to be detrimental to his vital interests, and he\r\nwould only approve of an agreement if both parties to it felt satisfied\r\nthat they had done a good stroke of business by concluding it. The\r\nnumerous \"community of interest\" agreements to which he signed his name\r\nestablished, the longer they lasted and the further they were extended,\r\nan increasingly intimate contact between the shipping firms all over the\r\nworld, thus proving that the consistent application of his principles\r\nwas justified by its success.\r\n\r\nIn politics, too, he regarded this line of action as the only correct\r\none. Over and over again he described the World War as a \"stupid war\" or\r\nas the \"most stupid of all wars,\" because its origin, the conflict\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Serbia, was so utterly meaningless to the\r\nprogress of the world. Its actual outbreak was caused by the strained\r\neconomic relations between Hungary and Serbia, or--to put it quite\r\nplainly--by the boycott of the Serbian pig, a matter which was surely of\r\nno importance to the world's trade and traffic at large. \"No Bismarck\r\nwas needed to prevent _this_ war,\" he often said when speaking of its\r\nimmediate origin.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of his does not mean that he shut his eyes to the\r\ndeep-seated antagonisms which were at the back of these local squabbles,\r\nviz., the Franco-Russian coalition against Germany, and the\r\nAnglo-German rivalry. The latter he regarded as sufficient to turn the\r\nscale; if it could be adjusted a World War, he felt sure, would be\r\navoided. The possibility of a universal conflagration had been pointed\r\nout to him by no less an authority than Prince Bismarck on the occasion\r\nof the latter's visit to Hamburg, when he was shown over the express\r\nsteamer of the Packetfahrt that was to bear his name. \"I shall not live\r\nto see the World War,\" Bismarck told him; \"but you will, and it will\r\nstart in the Near East.\"\r\n\r\nWith ever-increasing anxiety, Ballin noticed how, as a result of the\r\nGerman naval armaments, the Anglo-German antagonism came into existence,\r\nand how in time the position became worse and worse. When the\r\nGovernment, about the year 1900, embarked upon its propaganda for the\r\ncreation of a big navy, he lent it his active assistance, but in later\r\nyears he strongly opposed the naval race with Great Britain, trying to\r\nthe best of his ability to circumvent its disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nThe British argument against Germany's naval programme was that a nation\r\nwhich owned one-third of the inhabited globe and intended to maintain\r\nits supremacy could not renounce its naval predominance. His knowledge\r\nof British mentality--gained, as it was, through many years of\r\nintercourse with the English--told him that this reasoning was certainly\r\nunassailable from the British point of view, and that England would\r\nfight for its recognition to the bitter end. Therefore, he considered\r\nthe situation could only be met by an Anglo-German understanding. The\r\nfailure of arriving at such a solution was probably caused--apart from\r\npersonal motives--by the fact that in Germany the spirit of compromise\r\nwas not the predominant one, but that its place was taken by an\r\nexaggerated opinion of the country's own strength combined with a\r\ncertain ignorance regarding foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThis mental attitude is typical of the two factions which were\r\nall-powerful in Germany at the time, viz., what might be called the Old\r\nPrussian aristocracy, and the representatives of the heavy industries.\r\nThe common platform on which these two groups met was the policy to be\r\npursued regarding customs tariffs, which, although it formed the basis\r\nof the economic greatness of Germany, also prepared the way for serious\r\ninternational conflicts. During the war these two groups were in charge\r\nof what was meant to be the political policy of the country, but which\r\nwas, in fact, nothing but an inferior substitute for it.\r\n\r\nBallin's international position is illustrated by the fact that he was\r\nthe first to be approached in the matter of a projected Anglo-German\r\nrapprochement, an affair which reached its climax with Lord Haldane's\r\nvisit to Berlin. Owing to its historical interest this episode is worth\r\na detailed account.\r\n\r\nThe first steps in this direction date back as far as the year 1908, and\r\nthe ultimate breakdown of the project did not take place until the\r\noutbreak of the war. The British negotiator was Sir Ernest Cassel, who,\r\na native of Germany, had settled in England when quite young, and who\r\nhad become one of the world's most successful financiers. He was the\r\nintimate friend of King Edward from the time when the latter was Prince\r\nof Wales, and he also acted as his banker and as his political adviser.\r\nThe King visited his home almost daily during the last few years of his\r\nlife to take part in a game of bridge. The motives which may have\r\nprompted Sir Ernest to lend his assistance and his great influence to an\r\nendeavour which aimed at an understanding between his adopted country\r\nand the land of his birth need not, in the case of a man so clever and\r\nso experienced, be very far to seek. Sir Ernest repeatedly referred to\r\nhimself as a German, and as such he was deprived of his\r\nprivy-councillorship during the war. Thus it is quite likely that he\r\nmight have been prompted no less by an inherited predilection for the\r\none, than by an acquired preference for the other country. This very\r\nfact may also have enabled him to see matters with particular clearness\r\nof vision and without any prejudice. He and his friends reasoned\r\nsomewhat along the following lines:\r\n\r\nThe policy of King Edward having led to a considerable strengthening of\r\nthe position of France on the Continent, there arose the danger of an\r\narmed conflict between the continental Powers, especially as many points\r\nof dispute threatened at the same time to disturb the relations between\r\nGermany and Great Britain. These differences were caused on the one hand\r\nby the political activities of Germany as a world power, and on the\r\nother by her commercial and industrial expansion which bid fair to\r\nrelegate Great Britain to a subordinate position. People in England\r\nregarded the want of a system of protection similar to the German\r\nprotective tariffs as the real cause of this development, a want which\r\nretarded the progress of British industrialism, and which prevented\r\nBritish financiers from taking an active interest in these matters. The\r\nGerman financiers, however, exerted all their influence on behalf of the\r\nindustrial expansion of their country, thus emancipating it more and\r\nmore from foreign capital. The time during which the financing of the\r\nGerman industries by French money (the so-called French \"pensions\"),\r\ni.e. the discounting by French capitalists of bills drawn by German\r\nindustrialists, played an important part, and even represented a serious\r\nmenace in days of political tension, had only just passed, but, thanks\r\nto the increasing capital strength of Germany, its effects had now quite\r\nceased to make themselves felt.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to Great Britain of an understanding with Germany was that\r\nit would guarantee her maritime supremacy which she was resolved to\r\nmaintain at any price, whilst at the same time reducing the burden of\r\nher naval armaments which, in her case, too, had become wellnigh\r\ninsupportable. The Liberal Government then in power was particularly\r\ninterested in such financial retrenchment, being quite aware that the\r\ntime had arrived for the State to enter upon an era of social\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nContact between Ballin and the above-mentioned British groups was\r\nestablished through the agency of some friends of his connected with\r\nGerman high finance. The fact that the British selected Ballin to start\r\nthese negotiations is probably due to his well-known friendship with the\r\nKaiser, which suggested the possibility of approaching the German\r\nGovernment--even if only by informal channels in the first instance.\r\nThis first attempt, should it prove successful, might at any moment be\r\nfollowed up by direct negotiations between the two governments. In view\r\nof the traditional close connexion existing in England between business\r\ncircles on the one hand, and the politicians, the parties, and the\r\nGovernment on the other, such proceedings did not by any means imply a\r\npolicy of backstairs, but might be relied upon to open up a way for\r\nsounding German official quarters in the most natural manner.\r\n\r\nThe general tenor of Anglo-German relations at that time was somewhat as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe visit of King Edward to Wilhelmshöhe and that of the German Emperor\r\nand Empress to Windsor Castle in the summer of 1907 had been of a very\r\nfriendly character, and, together with other manifestations of\r\nfriendship exchanged between various German and British societies, they\r\nhad exercised a favourable impression on public opinion in both\r\ncountries. But very soon this friendly feeling was replaced by one of\r\nirritation. Great Britain and Russia had concluded an agreement\r\nconcerning their frontiers in the Middle East, and this led to questions\r\nin the Reichstag as to whether German interests had been properly\r\nsafeguarded. At the same time (in the summer of 1907) the Hague\r\nConference came to an end without having led to an understanding\r\nregarding the limitation of armaments, which many people in England\r\nwould have liked to be brought about. Towards the end of the year the\r\nGerman Government submitted to the Reichstag a Navy Bill by which the\r\nlife of the capital ships was to be reduced from 25 to 20 years. This\r\nwas tantamount to asking for the cost of three new ships of the line.\r\nSimultaneously a powerful propaganda for the navy was started, and when\r\nPrince Rupprecht of Bavaria resigned the protectorate of the Bavarian\r\nsection of the Navy League, because the League which at that time was\r\npresided over by the well-known General Keim had engaged in party\r\npolitics, his withdrawal had the undesirable effect of focusing public\r\nattention on the League's share in this agitation. This step, as was but\r\nnatural, brought about a change in the chairmanship of the League.\r\n\r\nIn England the agitation against Germany in general, and against her\r\nnaval policy in particular, became very violent in the early part of\r\n1908. In February _The Times_ announced that the Kaiser, for the express\r\npurpose of interfering with the British naval budget, had sent a letter\r\nto that effect to Lord Tweedmouth, the First Lord of the Admiralty. His\r\nlordship categorically denied in Parliament that the document had any\r\npolitical character whatever, but in spite of this denial, and in spite\r\nof the support which he received from Lord Lansdowne and from Lord\r\nRosebery, the matter produced a violent outburst of feeling on the part\r\nof the British Press and public. During March, 1908, both houses of\r\nParliament discussed German and British naval policy in great detail. In\r\nan article published by the _National Review_, Lord Esher, the chairman\r\nof the Imperial Maritime League, demanded that for every keel laid down\r\nby Germany, Britain should lay down two, and General Baden-Powell\r\ndescribed the danger of a German invasion as imminent. On the other\r\nhand, Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, emphasized in one of his\r\nspeeches the point of view referred to above, viz. that a reduction of\r\nthe naval burdens would also be desirable in the interest of Britain,\r\nbut that he could recommend such a policy only if the other governments\r\nconsented to do the same.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations might easily suggest to the clear-headed men of\r\nbusiness on either side of the North Sea how greatly it would be to the\r\nmutual advantage of both if a way could be found towards a limitation of\r\nnaval armaments.\r\n\r\nThe first interview between Ballin and Sir Ernest Cassel took place in\r\nthe summer of 1908, and Ballin afterwards gave the Kaiser a detailed\r\naccount of it when the latter visited Hamburg and Kiel at the end of\r\nJune. Another report, based on material supplied by Ballin, was composed\r\nby the chief of the Press Department of the Foreign Office, Geheimrat\r\nHammann, for the use of the Imperial Chancellor and the Foreign\r\nSecretary, and in the absence of any original account by Ballin himself,\r\nit may be permitted to give an outline of its contents below.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest opened the conversation by saying that for a long time back\r\nhe had desired to discuss the political situation simply in his capacity\r\nas a private person, and that he felt qualified to do so because of his\r\nintimate acquaintance with some of the leading personages and with\r\npolitics in general. He would like to contribute his share towards the\r\nprevention of a dangerous development of the existing rivalry. The King\r\nfelt very keenly that the rapid increase of the German naval forces\r\nconstituted a menace to Britain's maritime position. He was convinced,\r\nhowever, that his nephew would never provoke a wanton conflict, and\r\nthat, in his heart of hearts, he loathed the horrors of war. Although,\r\ntherefore, during his--the King's--lifetime the danger of an\r\nAnglo-German war was remote, it was nevertheless necessary that, when\r\nhis son succeeded him, the latter should find Britain's maritime\r\nposition so strong that the Kaiser's successor should be unable to\r\nassail it.\r\n\r\nWhen Ballin interposed at this stage that the British navy, because of\r\nits unchallenged superiority in numbers, need not be afraid of the newly\r\ncreated naval power of Germany, Sir Ernest replied that it was well\r\nknown to British naval experts that the increase of the German navy was\r\nconsiderably greater than the official statements made in the Reichstag\r\nwould let it appear. Undoubtedly the British navy would always preserve\r\nits superiority, not only numerically, but also technically with regard\r\nto material, construction, and armaments. Nevertheless, the advantages\r\npossessed by the German system of manning the ships and the great\r\nefficiency of German naval officers justified an apprehension lest the\r\nGerman superiority in the human factor might outweigh the British\r\nsuperiority in tonnage. The Boer war had taught England how difficult it\r\nwas to conquer a high-spirited, though numerically weak enemy. He said\r\nthat fear of the German danger formed the driving power of the whole\r\npolicy of the Entente, and that this policy was only meant to guard\r\nagainst that menace. Therefore Russia had been advised at the Reval\r\nmeeting to forgo the enlargement of her navy, and to concentrate all her\r\nenergies on her army.\r\n\r\nUpon Sir Ernest's intimation that at some date Britain, together with\r\nFrance and Russia, might inquire of Germany when she intended to put a\r\nstop to her naval armaments, Ballin replied that his friend, if he was\r\nanxious to render a really valuable service to Britain and to the cause\r\nof peace, could do no better than make it perfectly plain that such an\r\ninquiry would mean war. Germany would resist with her whole strength any\r\nsuch attempt which unmistakably suggested the methods employed at\r\nFashoda.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the interview Sir Ernest--who showed that he\r\npossessed excellent information concerning Germany's finances--observed\r\nthat the state of the same would render it very difficult for her to\r\nmake war. In that connexion he pointed out the intimate bearing of\r\ninternational finance on political relations, and he emphasized how much\r\nthe borrowing countries were dependent on the lending ones. Still, even\r\nthe creditor nations would sometimes be forced into an uncomfortable\r\nposition, as was, for instance, the case with Great Britain after the\r\nUnited States had passed on to her the greater part of the Japanese\r\ndebt. In Japan the disproportion between military burdens and economic\r\nstrength was becoming more and more pronounced, and if the country were\r\nfaced with the alternative of choosing between the total financial\r\nexhaustion of the people and a stoppage of the payment of interest, it\r\nwould prefer to take the latter course.\r\n\r\nIn London Ballin was present at the Constitutional Club when a Member of\r\nParliament made a speech in which he stated, with the general approval\r\nof his audience, that the position of Britain was not really so good as\r\nthe policy pursued by the Entente might lead one to believe. The\r\nnational balance-sheet had been much more satisfactory during the reign\r\nof Queen Victoria; the items now appearing on the credit side being\r\npartly bad debts incurred by Spaniards, Portuguese, and Japanese, for\r\nwhose political good behaviour Britain paid far too high a price, and\r\none should not allow oneself to be misled as to the value of these\r\nententes by balance-sheets which were purposely kept vague.\r\n\r\nGeheimrat Hammann told Ballin by letter that Prince Bülow, the Imperial\r\nChancellor, and Herr v. Schön, the Foreign Secretary, were very grateful\r\nto him for his information, and that in the opinion of both gentlemen\r\nhis reply to the suggestion concerning the stoppage of naval armaments\r\nwas \"as commendable as it was correct.\" Meanwhile the Kaiser had also\r\nsupplied the Chancellor with a general résumé of Ballin's report to him.\r\n\r\nBallin's visit gave rise to an exchange of letters which it may not be\r\ninappropriate to reproduce in this place. By way of explanation, it\r\nshould first be said that the Sandjak Railway project, to which\r\nreference is made in Ballin's letter, had greatly agitated public\r\nopinion all over Europe during the spring of 1908. In February, Count\r\nAehrenthal, the Austrian Foreign Minister, at a committee meeting of the\r\ndelegations, had announced the Government's intention of constructing a\r\nrailway line connecting the Bosnian system with the town of Mitrovitza\r\nin the Sandjak (or province) of Novi Bazar. This announcement led to a\r\nviolent outburst of the Russian Press, which described this project as a\r\npolitical _démarche_ on the part of Austria in the Balkans and as an\r\ninterference with the Macedonian reforms aimed at by the Powers. In\r\nAustria it was thought that Germany would support her ally as a matter\r\nof course, and Prince Bülow, in an interview given to a journalist,\r\ntried to pacify the _Novoie Vremia_. He declared that the Russian papers\r\nwere absolutely mistaken when they alleged that the project was inspired\r\nfrom Berlin, and he stated that Austria, like her German ally, pursued\r\nnone but commercial aims in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nThese remarks will be a sufficient explanation of the allusions\r\ncontained in Ballin's letter of July 13th, 1908, which, after an\r\nexpression of thanks for the hospitality extended to him, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"By the way, the views I expressed to you on the matter of the\r\n     Sandjak Railway are now completely borne out by the facts. Both the\r\n     Kaiser and, later, Prince Bülow have given me positive assurances\r\n     that the German Government was just as much taken by surprise on\r\n     hearing of this Austrian project as were the London and Petrograd\r\n     Cabinets.\r\n\r\n     \"I hope that our respective monarchs may soon meet now. There is\r\n     nothing that we on our side would welcome more heartily than the\r\n     establishment and the maintenance of the most friendly and most\r\n     cordial relations between the two sovereigns and their peoples. The\r\n     Kaiser will not return home from his Northern cruise and from his\r\n     visit to the Swedish Royal Court until the middle of August, but I\r\n     think it is probable that the two monarchs may meet when King\r\n     Edward returns from Marienbad, and that their Majesties will then\r\n     fix the date for the official return visit to Berlin. I sincerely\r\n     trust that this Berlin visit will be of the utmost benefit to both\r\n     countries.\"\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Cassel replied:\r\n\r\n     \"I also feel that the meeting of their Majesties must produce a\r\n     great deal of good, and, as I now hear, it will after all be\r\n     possible to arrange for this meeting to take place on the outward\r\n     journey of the King. I am still as convinced as ever that our side\r\n     is animated by the same friendly sentiments as yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting between the Kaiser and King Edward which was suggested in\r\nthese letters actually took place on August 11th at Friedrichshof\r\nCastle, when the King was on his way to Ischl, and it was accorded a\r\nfriendly reception in the German Press. It was followed up by an\r\nexchange of equally friendly manifestations on the part of the peoples\r\nof both countries. Mr. Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nwent to Germany in August, 1908, to study the German system of workmen's\r\ninsurance against disability and old age, and British workmen came to\r\nvisit German trade unions, and to gather information about German\r\nindustrial conditions. Official Britain also pronounced herself in\r\nfavour of an understanding between the two countries which Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge described as the only means of relieving the European tension,\r\nand Mr. Churchill professed similar sentiments.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, however, at the end of October, an event took place\r\nwhich severely compromised the Kaiser's policy, viz. the incident of the\r\n_Daily Telegraph_ interview. In this the Kaiser, amongst other matters,\r\nbitterly complained that his friendship for England received such scant\r\nacknowledgment. As a proof of the friendly sentiments by which his\r\nactions were guided he stated that he, during the Boer war, had refused\r\nthe humiliating suggestion put forward by France and Russia that the\r\nthree Powers conjointly should compel Britain to put a stop to the war;\r\nthat he had communicated this refusal to King Edward, and that he\r\npreviously had presented Queen Victoria with a plan of campaign mapped\r\nout by himself, to which the one actually pursued by Britain bore a\r\nstriking resemblance. With regard to Germany's naval programme, he\r\nemphasized that his country needed a big fleet in order to command\r\nattention when the question of the future of the Pacific was discussed.\r\nFinally, with regard to Anglo-German relations, the Kaiser said that the\r\nmiddle and lower classes in Germany did not entertain very friendly\r\nfeelings towards England.\r\n\r\nThe effect which this interview produced all over Germany was one of\r\nprofound consternation. Its publication led to the well-known\r\ndiscussions in the Reichstag in November, 1908, during which the Kaiser,\r\nto the great dismay of the nation, was staying at Donaueschingen with\r\nPrince Fürstenberg, where he was hunting. In England, and abroad\r\ngenerally, people regarded this interview as proving a great want of\r\nconsistency in the conduct of Germany's foreign policy, and this\r\nimpression was by no means changed when it became known that its\r\npublication was only due to an unfortunate oversight. The Kaiser had\r\nsent the account of it, as he was bound to do by the Constitution, to\r\nPrince Bülow, who was then staying at Norderney. Bülow, however, did not\r\nread it himself, but passed it on to the Berlin Foreign Office to be\r\nexamined. There, indeed, an examination took place, but only with a view\r\nto finding out whether it contained any errors of fact, and when this\r\nwas proved not to be the case, it was marked to that effect, passed the\r\nvarious ministries without any further examination, and was published.\r\nThis unfortunate chain of accidents did not, however, alter the fact\r\nthat the Kaiser ought to have been aware of the great political\r\nimportance of his utterances. It has always been a chief fault of his to\r\nspeak out too impulsively when it would have been politically more\r\nexpedient to be less communicative. Nor can the entourage of the\r\nsovereign be excused for not drawing his and the Chancellor's attention\r\nto the great political significance of his utterances. The Chancellor\r\nhimself and the Foreign Office, profiting from their previous\r\nexperiences with the Kaiser and his appearances in public, ought to have\r\nused a great deal more circumspection, and it would have been well if\r\nthe permanent officials in the Foreign Office had shown rather more\r\npolitical insight.\r\n\r\nThe endeavours of the official circles to remove the tension existing\r\nbetween the two countries were not affected by the incident. On February\r\n9th, 1909, King Edward and his Queen paid their visit to Berlin, thus\r\nbringing about the event which Ballin in his letter of July 13th, 1908,\r\nhad described as so very desirable. To appreciate the importance of this\r\nstrictly official visit, we must bear in mind the fact that it did not\r\ntake place until the ninth year of the reign of King Edward. This long\r\npostponement was no doubt due to a large extent to the estrangement\r\nbetween uncle and nephew, and this, in its turn, had its origin in the\r\nnatural dislike which the Kaiser felt for his uncle's mode of conducting\r\nhis private life while still Prince of Wales. It would have been\r\npreferable, however, to relegate such personal likes and dislikes to the\r\nbackground where politics or business were concerned. British official\r\ncomments emphatically underlined the significance of the visit, and the\r\nGerman Press followed suit, although voices were not wanting to warn\r\nagainst any over-estimation of such acts of courtesy. The reply given in\r\nthe Reichstag by Herr v. Schön, the Foreign Secretary, to a question as\r\nto whether any suggestions had been put forward by Great Britain with\r\nrespect to a reduction of naval armaments was very cool in its tone. His\r\nstatement amounted to this: that no formal proposal for an understanding\r\nwhich might have served as a basis for negotiations had been received,\r\nprobably for the reason that it was not customary among friendly Powers\r\nto put forward any proposals of which it was doubtful to say whether\r\nthey would be entertained.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this cold douche and in spite of other obstacles, the\r\npromoters of an understanding, Ballin and Sir Ernest Cassel, did not\r\ncease their efforts in that direction. In July, 1909, Ballin paid a\r\nsecond visit to Sir Ernest, during which the political discussions were\r\ncontinued. On these latter he reported to the Kaiser as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"My friend to whom I had intimated in a private letter written\r\n     about a week earlier that it was my intention to visit him--at the\r\n     same time hinting that, for my personal information, I should like\r\n     very much to take up the threads of the conversation we had had a\r\n     twelvemonth ago on the subject of the question of the navy--had\r\n     evidently used the interval to supply himself at the proper\r\n     quarters with authoritative information about this matter. During\r\n     the whole of our long talk he spoke with extraordinary assurance,\r\n     and every word seemed to be thought out beforehand.\r\n\r\n     \"At the commencement of our conversation I said to my friend that\r\n     in view of the great excitement which reigned in England on account\r\n     of the German naval armaments, and which was assuming a decidedly\r\n     anti-German character, he would quite understand that I should\r\n     desire to take up once more the interesting discussions which we\r\n     had had on the same subject a year ago. I pointed out that this\r\n     excitement--spread as it was by an unscrupulous press and fostered\r\n     by foolish politicians--was apt to produce results altogether\r\n     different from those which the Government might perhaps consider it\r\n     desirable to bring about within the scope of its programme. I\r\n     emphasized the fact that, of course, I was merely speaking as a\r\n     private citizen, reading with interest the English papers and the\r\n     letters of his English friends, so that all my knowledge of the\r\n     subject was derived from private sources.\r\n\r\n     \"A year ago, I said, my friend, in the clear and concise manner\r\n     that distinguished him, had explained to me the need for an\r\n     understanding between Germany and Britain governing the future\r\n     development of their naval forces, at the same time requesting me\r\n     to exert myself in that sense. This suggestion of his had not been\r\n     made in vain. The fact that I had been successful in establishing\r\n     complete concord amongst Germans, British, French, Italians,\r\n     Austrians, and a whole series of small nations on questions\r\n     affecting their highly important shipping interests, and in\r\n     replacing an unbridled and economically disastrous competition by\r\n     friendly agreements to the benefit of each partner, was bound to\r\n     make me sympathize with any measures that it was possible to take\r\n     in order to bring about a similar result between the Governments if\r\n     only they were met in the right spirit. I, therefore, had made up\r\n     my mind to submit such a plan to our Government, but before doing\r\n     so, it would be necessary for me to know whether Britain still\r\n     adhered to the principles which my friend had enunciated to me at\r\n     our previous meeting.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Ernest's reply was that as far as Britain was concerned a\r\n     great change had taken place during the interval, and that he was\r\n     no longer able to endorse the views he had held at that time. The\r\n     necessity for his country to maintain her supremacy on the sea at\r\n     all hazards, and subject to no engagements of any kind, was now\r\n     more clearly recognized than it had been a year ago. A one-sided\r\n     understanding between Germany and Britain could no longer be\r\n     thought of, since both Austria and France had now voted large sums\r\n     for the enlargement of their respective navies. Austria would\r\n     certainly be found on the German side, but France could by no means\r\n     be said to be an asset on which it would be safe for Britain to\r\n     rely, to say nothing about the two 'dark horses,' Russia and Italy.\r\n     If Britain, in view of these uncertainties, were to permit Germany\r\n     to nail her down to a fixed programme, she would dwindle down to a\r\n     fifth-rate Power. Germany possessed her overwhelmingly large army\r\n     with which she could keep in check Austria, Italy, Russia, and\r\n     France, but Britain had nothing but her navy to guarantee her\r\n     existence as a world power and to safeguard the roads that linked\r\n     her to her colonies. For many decades Britain had enjoyed\r\n     opportunities for accumulating big fortunes. These times, however,\r\n     had now passed. During the reign of the Emperor William II, who,\r\n     with a consistency which it would be difficult to praise too\r\n     highly, had made his country a commercial power of world-wide\r\n     importance, and who had raised German industrial enterprise and\r\n     German merchant shipping to a condition of undreamt-of prosperity,\r\n     Britain sustained immense losses in her overseas commerce. British\r\n     trade was declining, and there was no doubt but that in the long\r\n     run Britain would be compelled to abandon her principles of Free\r\n     Trade.\r\n\r\n     \"The question of the Austrian naval armaments appeared to trouble\r\n     my friend more than anything, and this circumstance, combined with\r\n     the doubtful attitude of Russia and the uncertainty of the\r\n     situation in France, was evidently a source of great anxiety to the\r\n     King. My friend remarked in this connexion that in his opinion the\r\n     moment chosen for the conclusion of an understanding was very\r\n     favourable to German but very unfavourable to British interests. It\r\n     was useless to talk of an agreement so long as an element of mutual\r\n     fear had to be reckoned with. At present this fear manifested\r\n     itself in Britain in a manner which was most inopportune, so that\r\n     it was bound to make the German public believe that Britain would\r\n     be ready to come to an understanding even if the terms of it were\r\n     detrimental to her own interests. Britain had got behindhand both\r\n     with her commerce and with her naval programme. To fight her\r\n     competitors in the world's trade with a fair chance of success was\r\n     impossible for more reasons than one, but the elimination of the\r\n     disadvantage from which she suffered with respect to her naval\r\n     armaments was merely a question of money. The funds that were\r\n     required to bring the British Navy up to the necessities of the\r\n     international situation would certainly be found, because they had\r\n     to be found.\r\n\r\n     \"I told my friend that I was astonished to hear how completely his\r\n     views had changed on these matters. Not what he did say, but what\r\n     he had left unsaid, made me suspect that official circles in\r\n     England--partly, perhaps, through the fault of the German\r\n     Government--had arrived at the conclusion that the latter would\r\n     refrain from a further strengthening of the navy after the existing\r\n     naval programme had been carried out, and that it would merely\r\n     content itself with the gradual replacement of the units as they\r\n     became obsolete. Such a proceeding could be justified only if the\r\n     same plan were adopted by Britain also. If, however, his remarks\r\n     implied that in the opinion of his Government the moment had now\r\n     arrived for altering the ratio of naval strength existing between\r\n     both countries by a comprehensive programme of new building, it\r\n     would soon become evident that there were some flaws in that\r\n     calculation. In view of any such intentions it was my\r\n     opinion--which, however, was quite personal and unofficial--that\r\n     Germany would have to decide upon such an increase of her navy as\r\n     would enable her to carry on a war of defence with the certainty of\r\n     success. If, therefore, Britain meant to go on building warships on\r\n     a large scale, this would merely lead to an aimless naval race\r\n     between the two countries.\r\n\r\n     \"These remarks of mine concluded our first conversation, and I\r\n     accepted my friend's invitation to dine with him that evening in\r\n     company with some prominent men of his acquaintance.\r\n\r\n     \"In the evening I was greatly surprised to see that I was the only\r\n     guest present. My friend told me that, in order to be alone with\r\n     me, he had cancelled his invitations to the other gentlemen,\r\n     stating that he did not yet feel well enough to see them. It was\r\n     obvious to me that he had, meanwhile, reported on the outcome of\r\n     our conversation, and that the atmosphere had changed. This change\r\n     had without doubt been brought about by my remarks concerning the\r\n     necessity for a further enlargement of the German Navy, if the\r\n     action of Britain compelled our Government to take such a course.\r\n     The long discussions that followed proved that this view of mine\r\n     was correct in every detail.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Ernest explained that the Liberal Cabinet had acted penny wise\r\n     and pound foolish in dealing with the question of the navy. This\r\n     was the conviction of the great majority of the British people, and\r\n     this action had caused the feelings of apprehension and of\r\n     hostility animating them. The Liberal Government had thus made a\r\n     serious blunder, and had, in his opinion, prepared its own doom by\r\n     doing so. He thought the days of the Liberal party were numbered,\r\n     and another party would soon be in office. Anti-German feeling\r\n     would be non-existent to-day if the Liberal cabinet had not,\r\n     because of its preoccupation with questions of social policy,\r\n     neglected the navy. The whole matter was further aggravated by\r\n     other questions of a political kind. France, on account of the\r\n     French national character, had always been a doubtful asset to\r\n     Britain, and, considering the state of her internal politics, she\r\n     was so now more than ever. Germany, on the other hand, possessed a\r\n     great advantage in that her military preponderance enabled her to\r\n     rely with absolute certainty on her Austrian ally. He would say\r\n     nothing about Russia, because he had never regarded the\r\n     Anglo-Russian _rapprochement_ as politically expedient.\r\n\r\n     \"If it was admitted--and he thought this admission was implied by\r\n     my remarks--that her colonial and her commercial interests made it\r\n     imperative for Britain to maintain an unchallenged supremacy on the\r\n     seas, he felt certain that some reasonable men would, after all, be\r\n     able to discover a formula which would make an understanding\r\n     between both countries possible. A great difficulty, however, was\r\n     presented by my often reiterated demand that Britain must not\r\n     abandon her principles of Free Trade. In questions such as these,\r\n     she could, indeed, speak for herself, but not for her great\r\n     colonies. History had proved that she lost her American colonies as\r\n     soon as she tried to foist her own commercial policy on the\r\n     colonists. He had no doubt that Germany, despite the disagreeable\r\n     surprises which she had experienced when adjusting the system of\r\n     her Imperial finances, possessed sufficient wealth to go on\r\n     increasing her navy in the same proportion as Britain. The great\r\n     mistake committed by the Liberal cabinet and by the other advisers\r\n     of the King had been their assumption that financial considerations\r\n     would prevent Germany from carrying out her naval programme in its\r\n     entirety. German prosperity had grown far more rapidly, he thought,\r\n     than even the German Government and German financial experts had\r\n     believed to be possible. Signs of it could be noticed wherever one\r\n     went, and one would turn round in astonishment if, during the\r\n     season, one heard the tourists in Italy or in Egypt talk in any\r\n     language but German. He, at any rate, felt certain of Germany's\r\n     ability to keep pace with Britain in the naval race, even if that\r\n     pace was very greatly accelerated.\r\n\r\n     \"Reasons of internal policy had convinced him that Britain would\r\n     not in any case abandon her Free Trade principles within a\r\n     measurable period of time, and as it was not intended to conclude a\r\n     perpetual agreement, but only one for a limited number of years, he\r\n     thought it was not at all necessary that Germany should insist\r\n     upon her demand in connexion with this question. As the colonies\r\n     enjoyed complete independence in these as in other matters, the\r\n     difficulties would be insurmountable. In return for such a\r\n     concession on Germany's part, Britain would doubtless be willing to\r\n     meet the views of the German Government in other respects. For\r\n     these reasons he would be quite ready to change the opinion he had\r\n     expressed in the morning, and to agree that it could produce\r\n     nothing but good if either side were to appoint some moderate men\r\n     for the purpose of discussing the whole question. Such a meeting\r\n     would have to be kept absolutely secret, and both parties should\r\n     agree that there should be no victor and no vanquished if and when\r\n     an agreement was concluded. This condition would have to be a _sine\r\n     qua non_.\r\n\r\n     \"I promised Sir Ernest that I would use my best endeavours to this\r\n     end when an opportunity should present itself, and we arranged to\r\n     have another meeting in the near future.\r\n\r\n     \"There is no doubt but that my friend is an extremely\r\n     well-qualified negotiator. I do not recollect that during my long\r\n     experience, extending over many years, I have ever come across a\r\n     man who could discuss matters for hours at a time with so much\r\n     self-reliance, deliberation, and fixity of purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThis report was passed on by the Kaiser to Herr v. Tirpitz, the\r\nSecretary for the Navy, who not only expressed his approval of the\r\nproject, but also recommended that the Imperial Chancellor, Herr v.\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, who had succeeded Prince Bülow on July 14th should be\r\nkept informed of all that was done to bring about an understanding. The\r\nChancellor, accordingly, was presented by the Kaiser himself with a copy\r\nof Ballin's report. This was the correct thing to do, as it avoided a\r\n_faux pas_ such as, during the chancellorship of Prince Bülow, had\r\nsometimes been made. Future developments, however, proved that this step\r\ndeprived the whole action of its spontaneity, and its immediate effect\r\nwas that the Secretary for the Navy was relieved of all responsibility\r\nin the matter. Ballin, in later days, summed up his views on this way of\r\ndealing with the subject by saying that if Herr v. Tirpitz had been left\r\na free hand in the whole matter--if, for instance, _he_ had conducted it\r\nas Imperial Chancellor--it would hardly have turned out a failure. The\r\nmain object of the negotiations that Ballin had carried on was to ensure\r\nthat a number of \"experts and men of moderate views,\" i.e. naval experts\r\nin the first instance, should join in conference in order to discuss\r\nhow, without injury to their relative fighting efficiency, both\r\ncountries could bring about a reduction of their naval armaments. This\r\nplan was so simple and so obviously right that, had it been carried out\r\nas a preliminary to something else, and had the attention of the experts\r\nbeen drawn to the enormous political importance of their decision,\r\nsuccess would have been assured. The procedure, however, which the\r\nChancellor adopted compelled him to combat the active opposition of the\r\nvarious departments involved even before a meeting of the naval experts\r\ncould be arranged for, and this was a task which far exceeded the\r\nstrength of Herr v. Bethmann-Hollweg, the most irresolute of all German\r\nchancellors, the man to whom Fate afterwards entrusted the most\r\nmomentous decision which any German statesman has ever had to make.\r\n\r\nAn interview between Ballin and the Chancellor was followed up, with the\r\nconsent of the latter, by an exchange of telegrams between Ballin and\r\nSir Ernest Cassel. From these it became clear that official circles in\r\nLondon were favourably disposed towards the opening of discussions in\r\naccordance with the terms laid down in Ballin's report, and Ballin\r\napproached the Chancellor with the request to let him know whether he\r\nshould continue to work on the same lines as before, or whether the\r\nChancellor would prefer a different method, by which he understood\r\ndirect official negotiations. In a telegram to the Chancellor he\r\nexplained that in his opinion Sir Ernest's reference to the friendly\r\ndisposition of official London implied that he was authorized to arrange\r\nthe details about the intended meeting of experts. If, therefore, he\r\nwent to England again, he would have to know what were the views and\r\nintentions of the Chancellor. The reply of the latter, dated August\r\n11th, was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Many thanks for your welcome telegram, which has found my closest\r\n     attention. I shall send you further details as soon as I have\r\n     interviewed the gentlemen concerned, which I intend to do to-morrow\r\n     and during the next few days.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply clearly showed that the Chancellor had made up his mind to\r\ndeal with the matter along official lines and in conformity with his own\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent course of events is indicated by a letter of the\r\nChancellor to Ballin, dated August 21st, in which he says:\r\n\r\n     \"I have to-day taken the official steps of which I told you. As Sir\r\n     Ernest Goschen[2] and I have agreed to observe absolute secrecy in\r\n     this matter, and as a statement of your friend to the British\r\n     Government to the effect that I had undertaken an official\r\n     _démarche_, might possibly be regarded as an indiscretion, I\r\n     suggest that if you inform your friend at all, you should word your\r\n     reply in such a way that this danger need not be feared.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter shows, and later events have also proved, that the guiding\r\nspirits of Germany's political destiny were unable to meet on such terms\r\nas expediency would dictate the overtures of a man like Sir Ernest\r\nCassel, whose status and whose good intentions were beyond criticism.\r\nIf, on receipt of this news, Sir Ernest, who had been working so hard\r\nfor an understanding, was not entirely discouraged, it was no doubt due\r\nto the diplomatic skill with which Ballin--who was a master of this art,\r\nas of so many others--interpreted the Chancellor's rebuff when\r\ncommunicating it to his friend.\r\n\r\nThat the latter's account of British feeling towards Germany was\r\nperfectly unbiased, may also be inferred from another piece of news\r\nwhich reached Ballin about the same time from a British source, and\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"My only object in writing just now is to say that if there is any\r\n     feeling in high quarters in your country favourable to coming to an\r\n     understanding with this country concerning naval matters, I am\r\n     quite satisfied from the inquiries I have made that the present\r\n     would be an opportune time for approaching this question, and that\r\n     the present Government of this country would be found entirely\r\n     favourable to coming to such an arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, by that time, the matter was in the hands of the various\r\ndepartments, and they proved unable to make a success of it. Why they\r\nfailed, and why the step which Herr v. Bethmann had taken with the\r\nBritish Ambassador produced no results, are questions which can only be\r\nanswered by reference to the files of the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith, in a speech dealing with the British naval programme\r\ndelivered on July 14th, 1910, explained why no understanding with\r\nGermany had been arrived at.\r\n\r\n     \"The German Government told us--I cannot complain, and I have no\r\n     answer to make--that their procedure in this matter is governed by\r\n     an Act of the Reichstag under which the programme automatically\r\n     proceeds year by year. That is to say, after the year 1911-12, the\r\n     last year in which under that law four Dreadnoughts are\r\n     constructed, the rate of construction drops in the two succeeding\r\n     years to two each year, so that we are now, we may hope, at the\r\n     very crest of the wave. If it were possible, even now, by\r\n     arrangement to reduce the rate of construction no one would be more\r\n     delighted than his Majesty's Government. We have approached the\r\n     German Government on the subject. They have found themselves unable\r\n     to do anything; they cannot do it without an Act of the Reichstag,\r\n     repealing their Navy Law. They tell us--and no doubt with great\r\n     truth--they would not have the support of public opinion in Germany\r\n     to a modified programme.\"\r\n\r\nAs these statements have never been contradicted, it must be assumed\r\nthat the departments concerned sheltered themselves behind the formal\r\nobjection that, owing to public feeling, a repeal or a modification of\r\nthe Navy Law was out of the question. If this assumption is correct, it\r\nis evident that no touch of political genius was revealed in the\r\ntreatment of this important question. Even the hope that the \"crest of\r\nthe wave\" had been reached turned out a disappointment, as was proved by\r\nthe introduction of the new Navy Bill in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe objections which Herr v. Bethmann, on March 30th, 1911, raised to an\r\ninternational limitation of armaments can likewise only be described as\r\nformal ones. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"If it is the intention of the Powers to come to an understanding\r\n     with regard to general international armaments, they must first of\r\n     all agree upon a formula defining the relative position of each....\r\n     Practically, it might be said, such an order of precedence has\r\n     already been established by Great Britain's claim that,\r\n     notwithstanding her anxiety to effect a reduction of her\r\n     expenditure on armaments, and notwithstanding her readiness to\r\n     submit any disputes to arbitration, her navy must under all\r\n     circumstances be equal--or even superior--to any possible\r\n     combination. Great Britain is perfectly justified in making this\r\n     claim, and in conformity with the views I hold on the disarmament\r\n     problem, I am the last person in the world to question her right to\r\n     do so. But it is quite a different matter to use such a claim as\r\n     the basis of an agreement which is to receive the peaceful consent\r\n     of the other Powers. What would happen if the latter raised any\r\n     counter-claims of their own, or if they were dissatisfied with the\r\n     percentage allotted to them? The mere suggestion of questions such\r\n     as these is sufficient to make us realize what would happen if an\r\n     international congress--because one restricted to the European\r\n     Powers alone could not be comprehensive enough--had to adjudicate\r\n     on such claims.\"\r\n\r\nIf this explanation is intended to be a reply to such statements from\r\nthe British side as the one just quoted from Mr. Asquith, the fact had\r\nbeen disregarded that the most serious problem under discussion--viz.\r\nthe Anglo-German rivalry--could quite well be solved without convening\r\nan \"international congress.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as December 10th, 1910, Herr v. Bethmann, in a speech delivered\r\nbefore the Reichstag, had enlarged on this same subject from the\r\npolitical point of view:\r\n\r\n     \"As to the relations between ourselves and Great Britain, and as to\r\n     the alleged negotiations with the latter country concerning a\r\n     mutual curtailment of naval armaments, I am bound to say that the\r\n     British Government, as everybody knows, has more than once\r\n     expressed its conviction that the conclusion of an agreement fixing\r\n     the naval strengths of the various Powers would conduce to an\r\n     important improvement of international relations.... We, too, share\r\n     Great Britain's desire to eliminate the question of naval\r\n     competition, but during the informal _pourparlers_ which have taken\r\n     place from time to time, and which have been conducted in a spirit\r\n     of mutual friendship, we have always given prominence to our\r\n     conviction that a frank discussion of the economic and political\r\n     spheres of interest to be followed up by a mutual understanding on\r\n     these points would constitute the safest way of destroying the\r\n     feeling of distrust which is engendered by the question of the\r\n     respective strengths of the military and naval forces maintained by\r\n     each country.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech which Sir Edward Grey delivered in the House of Commons on\r\nMarch 14th, 1911, with special reference to this speech of Herr v.\r\nBethmann shows unmistakably that the remarks of the latter did not\r\nreassure Great Britain with respect to the only point at issue in which\r\nshe was interested, viz. the limitation of the German naval programme.\r\nBritain, according to Sir Edward, did not desire that her relations with\r\nany Power should be of such a nature as to impede the simultaneous\r\nexistence of cordial relations with Germany. An Anglo-German agreement\r\nhad been specially suggested. This suggestion required some careful\r\nthinking over. If he were to hold out any hope that Germany, in\r\ncompliance with the terms of some such agreement would be willing to\r\ncancel or to modify her naval programme, he would be contradicted at\r\nonce. Only within the limits of this programme would it be possible to\r\ncome to some understanding between the two Governments. It might, for\r\ninstance, be agreed to spread the expenditure voted for the navy over a\r\nlonger term of years, or to arrange that the present German programme\r\nshould not be increased in future. Matters such as these could form the\r\nsubjects for discussion between the two Governments, and it would be\r\ndesirable from every point of view that an understanding should be\r\narrived at. To this speech the _North German Gazette_ replied that\r\nGermany would be quite prepared to fall in with Sir Edward's suggestions\r\nif agreements such as those outlined by him could in any way allay the\r\nfeeling of distrust governing public opinion in Great Britain. If from\r\nthis semi-official pronouncement it may be inferred that Herr v.\r\nBethmann on his part was favourably disposed towards an agreement, the\r\nquestion arises: \"Why was it not concluded?\"\r\n\r\nIn order to understand why the British Cabinet attached so much value to\r\nthe settlement of the Anglo-German naval questions and to the\r\npacification of public opinion, it must be remembered that the Liberal\r\nCabinet, owing to its hostile attitude towards the House of Lords, had\r\ndrifted into a violent conflict with the Conservative party, and that\r\nthe latter, in its turn, during the election campaign had accused the\r\nCabinet of having neglected the navy, driving home its arguments by\r\nconstantly pointing out the \"German danger.\" Moreover, King Edward had\r\ndied in the meantime (May 6th, 1910), and of his son and successor it\r\nwas said that he, at the time of his accession to the throne, was no\r\nlonger a man of unbiased sentiment, that he was very anti-German, and\r\nthat he was under the influence of a small group of Conservative\r\nextremists.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to reproduce in this connexion the text of\r\ntwo accounts dealing with the situation in England which Ballin wrote in\r\nthe spring and in the summer of 1910 respectively, when he was staying\r\nin London, and which he submitted to the Kaiser for his information.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1910 he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"If I were to say that London was completely dominated by the\r\n     election campaign, this would be a very mild way of characterizing\r\n     the situation as it is. The whole population has been seized with a\r\n     fit of madness. The City men who, until quite recently, had\r\n     preserved an admirable calm, have now lost their heads altogether,\r\n     and are the most ardent advocates of Tariff Reform. Every victory\r\n     of a Conservative candidate is cheered by them to the echo. Under\r\n     these circumstances, even in the City, the fear of war has grown.\r\n     If we ask ourselves what it is that has brought about such an\r\n     extraordinary change in the attitude of commonsense business\r\n     people, we find that there are several reasons for it, viz. the\r\n     general slump in business; the unfortunate policy cf Lloyd George\r\n     with regard to the Irish Nationalists; the advances he made to the\r\n     Labour Party, and the effects of his social legislation which are\r\n     now felt with increasing seriousness.\r\n\r\n     \"Business is bad in England, and up to now very little has been\r\n     seen of the improvement which is so marked in Germany. It is but\r\n     natural that, in view of the extended trade depression which has so\r\n     far lasted more than two years, a people endowed with such business\r\n     instincts as the British should feel favourably disposed towards a\r\n     change of the country's commercial policy. This disposition is\r\n     further strengthened by the constant reiteration of the promise\r\n     that it will be possible to provide the money needed for new\r\n     warship construction and for the newly inaugurated social policy by\r\n     means of the duties which the foreigner will be made to pay.\r\n\r\n     \"It seems pretty certain that the present Government, in spite of\r\n     the great election successes gained by the Conservative party, will\r\n     still retain a slight majority if it can rely on the Nationalist\r\n     vote. That is what I had always predicted. But the majority on\r\n     which the Liberal Cabinet depends will doubtless be a very\r\n     uncomfortable one to work with, and the opinion is general that it\r\n     will hardly take more than a twelvemonth before another dissolution\r\n     of Parliament will be necessary. It is said that the elections that\r\n     will then be held will smash up the Liberal party altogether, but I\r\n     consider this is an exaggeration. In this country everything\r\n     depends on the state of business. If, in the course of the year,\r\n     trade prospects brighten up again, and if everything becomes normal\r\n     once more, the Tariff Reformers in the City will turn Free Traders\r\n     again and will take great care not to kill the goose that lays the\r\n     golden eggs. I am quite convinced that everything hangs on the\r\n     future development of trade and traffic. To-day, as I have said\r\n     before, Tariff Reform and a Zollverein with the Colonies are the\r\n     catchwords that are on everybody's lips, and the anti-German\r\n     feeling is so strong that it is scarcely possible to discuss\r\n     matters with one's oldest friends, because the people over here\r\n     have turned mad and talk of nothing but the next war and the\r\n     protective policy of the near future. Large crowds are spending\r\n     hours every night in the principal squares such as Trafalgar\r\n     Square, where they have come to watch the announcements of the\r\n     election results in the provinces. Their behaviour is exemplary. It\r\n     is a curious thing that in this country the election game is spread\r\n     over several weeks, in consequence of which the political\r\n     excitement of the masses is raised to boiling-point. Within a few\r\n     months' time, I am sure, things will look entirely different\r\n     again.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the second report, in the summer of 1910, the following is the\r\nsalient extract:\r\n\r\n     \"I am now returned from England, and it may not be out of place to\r\n     report the impressions I received of the political and economic\r\n     conditions over there.\r\n\r\n     \"My previous visit to London coincided with the big election\r\n     campaign, and I have already described the fit of mad excitement\r\n     which had taken possession of the people, and which was directed\r\n     against Germany.\r\n\r\n     \"The situation has now undergone a complete change, which is\r\n     noticeable everywhere and which is caused by the close of the\r\n     election campaign, by the death of the King, and, finally, by the\r\n     visit of the Kaiser on the occasion of the Royal funeral. Everyone\r\n     whom I met in London--Liberals and Conservatives alike--spoke in\r\n     terms of the highest praise of the Kaiser's sympathetic attitude\r\n     displayed during his stay in England, and which was all the more\r\n     commendable as it was not denied that he had suffered many slights\r\n     during the lifetime of his late uncle.\r\n\r\n     \"The attitude of the people towards the new monarch is one of\r\n     reserve, but also--in conformity with the national character of the\r\n     English--one of loyalty and good faith. The situation with regard\r\n     to home politics is as difficult now as it has been all along.\r\n     Unless a compromise between the parties is arrived at new elections\r\n     will be unavoidable in the spring or even before. I have met a\r\n     great many persons of political experience who are of opinion that,\r\n     even if a compromise is made, it will be necessary to submit such\r\n     an arrangement to the decision of the electorate by an appeal to\r\n     the country. It is difficult to predict the result of such new\r\n     elections. The views held by large sections of the Press and of the\r\n     public bear out the truth of the remarks in my previous letter when\r\n     I emphasized the fact that the British are a nation of business men\r\n     who act on the principle of 'leave well alone,' and who will refuse\r\n     to have anything to do with Tariff Reform as soon as there is an\r\n     improvement in trade.\r\n\r\n     \"Business has, indeed, improved in the meantime, but only very\r\n     slightly, and much less than in Germany. This slight improvement,\r\n     however, has not failed to give a fillip to the cause of Free Trade\r\n     among the City men. If elections in the spring are regarded as\r\n     likely, much will depend on the further development of trade. I\r\n     must confess that I take a very pessimistic view as to the future\r\n     of Great Britain in this respect. The British can really no longer\r\n     compete with us, and if it were not for the large funds they have\r\n     invested, and for the sums of money which reach the small\r\n     mother-country from her great dominions, their saturated and\r\n     conservative habits of life would soon make them a _quantité\r\n     négligeable_ as far as their competition with us in the world's\r\n     markets is concerned.\r\n\r\n     \"Of course, their financial strength and their excellent system of\r\n     foreign politics, in which they have now been trained for\r\n     centuries, will always attract business to their country, the\r\n     possession of which we shall always begrudge them (for is not envy\r\n     one of the national characteristics of the German race?).\"\r\n\r\nUp to the summer of 1911 the feeling remained friendly. Early in July\r\nBallin wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"To-day the feeling, as far as the City is concerned, is thoroughly\r\n     friendly towards Germany. The visit in the spring of the Kaiser\r\n     and the Kaiserin, on the occasion of the unveiling of the monument\r\n     to Queen Victoria, has created a most sympathetic impression--an\r\n     impression which has been strengthened by the participation of the\r\n     Crown Prince and Princess in the Coronation festivities. At present\r\n     the Kaiser is actually one of the most popular persons in England,\r\n     and the suggestion of bringing about an Anglo-German understanding\r\n     is meeting with a great deal of approval from all sections of the\r\n     population.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, this readiness to come to an understanding received a setback\r\nduring the course of the year, when it was adversely affected by the new\r\ndevelopments in the Morocco affair and by the dispatch of the _Panther_\r\nto Agadir, which led to fresh complications with France, and later also\r\nwith Great Britain. The grievances of the latter found expression in a\r\nsharply worded speech by Lloyd George in July, 1911, the main argument\r\nof which was that Great Britain, in questions affecting her vital\r\ninterests, could not allow herself to be treated as though she were\r\nnon-existent. In Germany this pronouncement led to violent attacks on\r\nthe part of the Conservative opposition against Herr v. Bethmann and\r\nagainst England, and it was the latter against whom Herr v. Heydebrand\r\ndirected his quotation from Schiller, to the effect that a nation which\r\ndid not stake her everything on her honour was deserving only of\r\ncontempt. It is also well known that the outcome of the whole affair, as\r\nwell as its sequel, the Franco-German Congo agreement, produced much\r\nindignation in Germany, where it was felt that the material results\r\nobtained were hardly worth the great display of force, and that it was\r\nstill less worth while to be drifted into a big war in consequence of\r\nthis incident.\r\n\r\nThe measure of the anxiety which was felt at that time in business and\r\nfinancial circles all over the world may be gauged by reading the\r\nfollowing letter from Ballin to the Secretary of State, Herr v.\r\nKiderlen-Wächter, in which it is necessary to read between the lines\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\n     \"Baron Leopold de Rothschild has just sent me a wire from London in\r\n     which he says that, on the strength of information he has received\r\n     from the Paris Rothschilds, people there are greatly disappointed\r\n     to see that the German answer--the details of which are still\r\n     unknown there--leaves some important questions still unsolved.\r\n     Public sentiment in the French capital, he says, is beginning to\r\n     get excited, and it would be to the interest of everybody to settle\r\n     matters as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n     \"I felt it my duty to draw your attention to this statement, and\r\n     you may take it for what it is worth.\r\n\r\n     \"I need not tell your Excellency that people here and, I suppose,\r\n     all over Germany, are watching the progress of events with growing\r\n     anxiety. In this respect, therefore, the desires of the German\r\n     people seem identical with those of the French.\r\n\r\n     \"It would also be presumptuous on my part to speak to your\r\n     Excellency about the feeling in England and the British armaments,\r\n     as the information you derive from your official sources is bound\r\n     to be better still than that which I can obtain through my\r\n     connexions.\r\n\r\n     \"With best wishes for a successful solution of this difficult and\r\n     important problem, I have the honour to remain,\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency's most obedient servant,\r\n(_Signed_) BALLIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA most interesting document, and one which casts a clear sidelight on\r\nthe divergence of opinion held in Germany and Great Britain, and on the\r\nchances of arriving at an agreement, is an article which dates from the\r\nlatter part of 1911.\r\n\r\nThis article deals with the Anglo-German controversy and was published\r\nby the _Westminster Gazette_. It was sent to Ballin by an English friend\r\nwith the remark that it presented a faithful picture of the views on\r\nforeign affairs held by the great majority of British Liberals. Ballin\r\nforwarded it to Berlin for the Kaiser's information, with a note saying\r\nthat he had received it from one of the most level-headed Englishmen he\r\nhad ever met. It was subsequently returned to him, with the addition of\r\na number of marginal notes and a lengthy paragraph at its close, all\r\nwritten in the Kaiser's own handwriting. The numerous underlinings, too,\r\nare the Kaiser's own work. On account of its historical interest a\r\nfacsimile reproduction of this article is inserted at the end of the\r\nbook. The following is a translation of the Kaiser's criticism at the\r\nconclusion of the article:\r\n\r\n     \"Quite good, except for the ridiculous insinuation that we are\r\n     aspiring after the hegemony in Central Europe. We simply _are_\r\n     Central Europe, and it is quite natural that other and smaller\r\n     nations should tend towards us and should be drawn into our sphere\r\n     of action owing to the law of gravity, particularly so if they are\r\n     of our own kin. To this the British object, because it absolutely\r\n     knocks to pieces their theory of the Balance of Power, i.e. their\r\n     desire to be able to play off one European Power against another at\r\n     their own pleasure, and because it would lead to the establishment\r\n     of a united Continent--a contingency which they want to prevent at\r\n     all costs. Hence their lying assertion that we aim at a predominant\r\n     position in Europe, while it is a fact that they claim such a\r\n     position for themselves in world politics. We Hohenzollerns have\r\n     never pursued such ambitious and such fantastic aims, and, God\r\n     granting it, we shall never do so.\r\n\r\n\"(_Signed_) WILHELM I.R.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1912 opened with several pronouncements of the British Press in\r\nfavour of an Anglo-German understanding. It was even hinted that Britain\r\nwould raise no objections to a possible extension of Germany's colonial\r\nactivities, or, as one paper put it, \"to the foundation of a German\r\nAfrican empire stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean.\"\r\nSimilar sentiments were expressed in a letter from Sir Ernest Cassel to\r\nBallin, dated January 9th, 1912.\r\n\r\n     \"Since writing to you last,\" says Sir Ernest, \"I have had the\r\n     opportunity of a confidential chat with Mr. Winston Churchill. He\r\n     is aware that the position which he has now occupied for some time\r\n     ties him down to some special limitations which will not allow him\r\n     to pay a visit of the kind you suggest so long as the situation\r\n     remains what it is. Should the King go to Germany, and should he\r\n     take Winston with him, he--Winston--would feel highly honoured if\r\n     he were permitted to discuss the important questions that were\r\n     demanding a solution. Such an opportunity would have to come about\r\n     quite spontaneously, and Winston would have to secure the previous\r\n     consent of the Prime Minister and of Sir Edward Grey.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus far Winston. His friendly sentiments towards Germany are\r\n     known to you. I have been acquainted with him since he was quite a\r\n     young man, and he has never made a secret of his admiration of the\r\n     Kaiser and of the German people. He looks upon the estrangement\r\n     existing between the two countries as senseless, and I am quite\r\n     sure he would do anything in his power to establish friendly\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\n     \"The real crux of the situation is that Great Britain regards the\r\n     enormous increase of the German Navy as a grave menace to her vital\r\n     interests. This conviction is a deep-rooted one, and there are no\r\n     two opinions in London as to its significance.\r\n\r\n     \"If it were possible to do something which, without endangering the\r\n     safety of Germany, would relieve Great Britain of this nightmare,\r\n     it is my opinion that people over here would go very far to\r\n     conciliate German aspirations.\"\r\n\r\nThe striking fact that after a long interval, and in spite of the\r\nfailure of the previous endeavours, a renewed attempt was made to arrive\r\nat a naval understanding, and that special pains were taken to ensure\r\nits success, may be due to various causes. For instance, the Morocco\r\nincident of 1911 had shown how easily a series of comparatively\r\nunimportant events might lead within reach of a dangerous catastrophe,\r\nunless the atmosphere of general distrust could be removed, and it was\r\nfelt in Great Britain that this distrust was largely the result of the\r\nconstant and regular increase of Germany's armaments. Moreover, it was\r\nknown that a new Navy Bill was then forthcoming in Germany which, in its\r\nturn, would be bound to cause fresh alarm, and growing expenditure in\r\nGreat Britain, and that the Liberal Cabinet would prefer to gain its\r\nlaurels by bringing about a more peaceful frame of mind. Finally, Mr.\r\nWinston Churchill had been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in\r\nOctober, 1911, and as he was known to be by no means anti-German, his\r\nentering upon office may have given rise to the hope that, while he was\r\nadministering the affairs of the Navy, it would be possible to settle\r\ncertain purely technical matters affecting his department, which could\r\nthen furnish the conditions preliminary to an understanding with\r\nGermany. Ballin, at any rate, had cherished the hope--as is borne out by\r\nthe letter quoted above--that Mr. Churchill could be induced to pay a\r\nvisit to Germany, and that an opportunity might then be found to bring\r\nthe naval experts of both countries face to face with each other. Ballin\r\nhad always eagerly desired that such a meeting should take place,\r\nbecause his long experience in settling difficult business questions had\r\ntaught him that there was no greater barrier between people, and\r\ncertainly none that hampered their intellectual _rapprochement_ to a\r\nlarger extent, than the fact of their never having come into personal\r\ncontact with one another, and of never having had a chance to actually\r\nfamiliarize themselves with the mentality and the whole personality of\r\nthe man representing the other side. It might also be assumed that, once\r\nthe two really responsible persons--Churchill and Tirpitz--had met in\r\nconclave, the feeling of their mutual responsibility would be too strong\r\nto allow the negotiations to end in failure.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, such a meeting never took place; all that was achieved\r\nwas a preliminary step, viz. the visit of Lord Haldane to Berlin.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lack of documentary evidence it is not possible to say who\r\nfirst suggested this visit, but it is clear that the suggestion--whoever\r\nmay have been its author--was eagerly taken up by Sir Ernest Cassel and\r\nBallin, and that it also met with a warm welcome on the part of Herr v.\r\nBethmann. In reply to a telegram which Ballin, with the approval--if not\r\nat the actual desire--of the Chancellor, sent to his friend in London, a\r\nmessage reached him on February 2nd, 1912, when he was in Berlin engaged\r\non these very matters. This reply, which originated with the Foreign\r\nOffice, expressed the sender's thanks for the invitation to attend a\r\nmeeting of delegates in Berlin and his appreciation of the whole spirit\r\nwhich had prompted the German suggestion, and then went on to say that\r\nthe new German Navy Bill would necessitate an immediate increase in the\r\nBritish naval estimates, because the latter had been framed on the\r\nsupposition that the German programme would remain unaltered. If the\r\nBritish Government were compelled to find the means for such an\r\nincrease, the suggested negotiations would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible. On the other hand, the German programme might perhaps be\r\nmodified by spreading it out over a longer period of time or by some\r\nsimilar measure, so that a considerable increase of British naval\r\nconstruction in order to balance the German efforts could be avoided. In\r\nthat case the British Government would be ready to proceed with the\r\nnegotiations without loss of time, as it would be taken for granted that\r\nthere was a fair prospect of the proposed discussions leading to a\r\nfavourable result. If this suggestion was acceptable to Germany, the\r\nBritish Government thought the next step should be a private--and not an\r\nofficial--visit of a British Cabinet Minister to Berlin.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is now permissible to give the text of some documents without\r\nany further comment, as these latter speak for themselves. The first is\r\na letter of the Chancellor addressed to Ballin, and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN. _Febr. 4th, 1912._\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MR. BALLIN,--\r\n\r\n     \"We are still busy wording the text of our reply, and I shall not\r\n     be able to see you at 11 o'clock. As soon as the text is settled, I\r\n     shall submit it to His Majesty for his approval. Under these\r\n     circumstances I think it is doubtful whether we ought to adhere to\r\n     the time fixed for our appointment. I rather fancy that I cannot\r\n     tell you anything definite before 12 or 1 o'clock, and I shall ring\r\n     you up about that time. You have already made such great sacrifices\r\n     in the interest of our cause that I hope you will kindly accept\r\n     this alteration as well.\r\n\r\n     \"In great haste.\r\n\r\n\"(_Signed_) BETHMANN-HOLLWEG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next document is a letter of Ballin to Sir Ernest Cassel, intended\r\nto explain the situation.\r\n\r\n     \"The demand raised by your official telegram rather complicates\r\n     matters. The fact is that the Bill as it stands now only asks for\r\n     half as much as was contained in the original draft. This reduced\r\n     demand is much less than the nation and the Reichstag had expected.\r\n     If after this a still further curtailment is decided upon, such a\r\n     step will create the highly undesirable impression that, in order\r\n     to pave the way for an understanding with London, it had become\r\n     necessary to make very considerable sacrifices. This, of course,\r\n     must be avoided at all costs, because if and when an understanding\r\n     is arrived at, there must be neither victors nor vanquished.\r\n\r\n     \"I need not emphasize the fact that our Government is taking up the\r\n     matter with the greatest interest and that it is keenly anxious to\r\n     bring about a successful issue. The reception with which you have\r\n     met on our side must have given you convincing and impressive\r\n     proofs of this attitude.\r\n\r\n     \"I have now succeeded in making our gentlemen promise me--although\r\n     not without much reluctance on their part--that they would not\r\n     object to the formula proposed by your Government, viz. 'It is\r\n     agreed to submit the question of the proposed increase of naval\r\n     tonnage to a _bona fide_ discussion.' Thus there is now a fair\r\n     prospect of reaching a favourable result, and the preliminary\r\n     condition laid down by your Government has been complied with.\r\n\r\n     \"I think that the delegate sent should be accompanied by a naval\r\n     expert. The gentleman in question should also understand that he\r\n     would have to use the utmost frankness in the discussions, and that\r\n     he must be able to give an assurance that it is intended to subject\r\n     the British programme, too, to such alterations as will make it not\r\n     less, but rather more, acceptable than it is now. Surely, your\r\n     Government has never desired that we should give you a definite\r\n     undertaking on our part, whereas you should be at liberty to extend\r\n     your programme whenever you think fit to do so. A clearly defined\r\n     neutrality agreement is another factor which will enter into the\r\n     question of granting the concessions demanded by your Government.\r\n\r\n     \"'Reciprocal assurances' is a term which it is difficult to define;\r\n     if, for instance, the attitude of Great Britain and her action last\r\n     summer had been submitted to a court of law, it would hardly be\r\n     found to have violated the obligations implied by such 'reciprocal\r\n     assurances,' and yet we were at the edge of war owing to the steps\r\n     taken by your people.\r\n\r\n     \"I thought it my duty, my dear friend, to submit these particulars\r\n     to you, so that you, for the benefit of the great cause we are\r\n     engaged in, may take whatever steps you consider advisable before\r\n     the departure of the delegate.\r\n\r\n     \"Our people would appreciate it very much if you would make the\r\n     great sacrifice of coming over to this country when the meeting\r\n     takes place. I personally consider this also necessary, and it\r\n     goes without saying that I shall be present as well.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S.--The Chancellor to whom I have shown this letter thinks it\r\n     would be better not to send it, because the official note contains\r\n     all that is necessary.\r\n\r\n     \"However, I shall forward it all the same, because I believe it\r\n     will present a clearer picture of the situation to you than the\r\n     note. Please convince the delegate that it is a matter of give and\r\n     take, and please come. It entails a great sacrifice on your part,\r\n     but the cause which we have at heart is worth it.\r\n\r\n     \"The bearer of this note is our general secretary, Mr. Huldermann.\r\n     He is a past master of discretion, and fully acquainted with the\r\n     situation.\"\r\n\r\nI was instructed to hand the following note by the German Government to\r\nSir Ernest Cassel with the request to pass it on to the British\r\nGovernment, and at the same time I was to explain verbally and in\r\ngreater detail the contents of Ballin's letter on the situation.\r\n\r\nThe text of the official note is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We are willing to continue the discussion in a friendly spirit.\r\n     The Navy Bill is bound to lead to a discussion of the naval plans\r\n     of both countries, and in this matter we shall be able to fall in\r\n     with the wishes of the British Government if we, in return, receive\r\n     sufficient guarantees as to a friendly disposition of British\r\n     policy towards our own interests. Any agreement would have to state\r\n     that either Power undertakes not to join in any plans,\r\n     combinations, or warlike complications directed against the other.\r\n     If concluded, it might pave the way for an understanding as to the\r\n     sums of money to be spent on armaments by either country.\r\n\r\n     \"We assume that the British Government shares the views expressed\r\n     in this note, and we should be glad if a British Cabinet minister\r\n     could proceed to Berlin, in the first instance for the purpose of a\r\n     private and confidential discussion only.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day (February 4th) I left for London. I\r\narrived there the following evening and went straight to Sir Ernest\r\nCassel. I prepared the following statement for Ballin at the time, in\r\nwhich I described the substance of our conversation and the outcome of\r\nmy visit:\r\n\r\n     \"The note which I had brought with me did not at first satisfy our\r\n     friend. He made a brief statement to the effect that we saw a fair\r\n     prospect of reaching a successful solution of the problem was all\r\n     that was needed, and that our answer was lengthy, but evasive. This\r\n     opinion, however, he did not maintain after the close of our\r\n     conversation, which lasted more than two hours. I pointed out to\r\n     him that, as I understood it, the phrase 'We are willing to\r\n     continue the discussion in a friendly spirit' amounted to a\r\n     declaration on the part of the German Government that, in its\r\n     opinion, there was a 'fair prospect,' and that an accommodating\r\n     spirit was all one could ask at present. He thought that Lord\r\n     Haldane had been asked to go to Berlin so that a member of the\r\n     Cabinet should have an opportunity of ascertaining on the spot that\r\n     Berlin was really disposed to discuss matters in a friendly spirit.\r\n     On this point positive assurances were needed before Sir Edward\r\n     Grey and Mr. Winston Churchill went across, who, if they did go,\r\n     would not return without having effected the object of their visit.\r\n     Sir Ernest always emphasized that he only stated his own private\r\n     views, but it was evident that he spoke with the highest authority.\r\n     The demand for three Dreadnoughts, he said, which the new German\r\n     Navy Bill asked for, amounted to a big increase of armaments, and\r\n     Great Britain would be compelled to counterbalance it by a\r\n     corresponding increase, which she would not fail to do. If,\r\n     however, Germany were prepared not to enlarge her existing\r\n     programme, Great Britain would be pleased to effect a reduction on\r\n     her part. When I referred to the apprehension of the German\r\n     Government lest Great Britain should take advantage of the fact\r\n     that Germany had her hands tied, in order to effect big armaments\r\n     which it would be impossible for us to equal, our friend remarked\r\n     that, for the reason stated above, such fears were groundless. In\r\n     spite of this assurance, I repeatedly and emphatically drew his\r\n     attention to the necessity for limiting the British programme just\r\n     as much as the German one. He evidently no longer fancied the\r\n     suggestion previously put forward that the question of agreeing\r\n     upon a definite ratio of strength for the two navies should be\r\n     discussed; because, if this was done, one would get lost in the\r\n     details. Nevertheless, he did not, as the discussion proceeded,\r\n     adhere to this standpoint absolutely. He agreed that the essential\r\n     thing was to establish friendly political relations, and if, as I\r\n     thought, Germany had reason to complain of British opposition to\r\n     her legitimate expansion, one could not do better than discuss the\r\n     various points at issue one by one, similar to the method which had\r\n     proved so successful in the case of the Anglo-French negotiations.\r\n     Great Britain would not raise any objections to our desire for\r\n     rounding-off our colonial empire, and she was quite willing to\r\n     grant us our share in the distribution of those parts of the globe\r\n     that were still unclaimed.\r\n\r\n     \"By keeping strictly to the literal text of the German note, he\r\n     found the latter quite acceptable as far as it referred to the\r\n     question of a declaration of neutrality. He said there was a great\r\n     difference between such declarations, and often it was quite\r\n     possible to interpret them in various ways. I imagined that what\r\n     was in his mind were the obligations which Britain had taken upon\r\n     herself in her agreement with France, and I therefore asked him for\r\n     a definition of the term 'neutrality.' His answer was very guarded\r\n     and contained many reservations. What he meant was something like\r\n     this: Great Britain has concluded agreements with France, Russia,\r\n     and other countries which oblige her to remain neutral where the\r\n     other partner is concerned, except when the latter is engaged in a\r\n     war of aggression.\r\n\r\n     \"Applied to two practical cases, this would mean: If an agreement\r\n     such as the one now under consideration had been in existence at\r\n     the time of the Morocco dispute last summer, Great Britain would\r\n     have been free to take the side of France if war had broken out\r\n     between that country and ourselves, because in this case we--as he\r\n     argued with much conviction--had been the aggressors. On the other\r\n     hand, if we had severed our relations with Italy during the\r\n     Turco-Italian war and had come to the support of Turkey, Great\r\n     Britain would not have been allowed to join Italy in conspiring\r\n     against us if we had an agreement such as the one in question.\r\n\r\n     \"In the interval between my first and my second visit Sir Ernest\r\n     evidently had, by consulting his friend Haldane, arrived at a very\r\n     definite opinion, and when I visited him for the second time he\r\n     assured me most emphatically that Great Britain would concede to us\r\n     as much as she had conceded to the other Powers, but not more. We\r\n     could rely on her absolute loyalty, 'and,' he added, 'our attitude\r\n     towards France proves that we can be loyal to our friends.'\r\n\r\n     \"For the rest, the manner in which he pleaded the British point of\r\n     view was highly interesting. Great Britain, he argued, had done\r\n     great things in the past, but owing to her great wealth a decline\r\n     had set in in the course of the last few decades. ('Traces of this\r\n     development,' he added, 'have also been noticeable in your\r\n     country.') Germany, however, had made immense progress, and within\r\n     the next fifteen or twenty years she would overtake Great Britain.\r\n     If, then, such a dangerous competitor commenced to increase his\r\n     armaments in a manner which could be directed only against Britain,\r\n     he must not be surprised if the latter made every effort to check\r\n     him wherever his influence was felt. Great Britain, therefore,\r\n     could not remain passive if Germany attempted to dominate the whole\r\n     Continent; because this, if successful, would upset the Balance of\r\n     Power. Neither could she hold back in case Germany attacked and\r\n     annihilated France. Thus, the situation being what it was, Britain\r\n     was compelled--provided the proposed agreement with Germany was not\r\n     concluded--to decide whether she would wait until her competitor\r\n     had become still stronger and quite invincible, or whether she\r\n     would prefer to strike at once. The latter alternative, he thought,\r\n     would be the safer for her interests.\r\n\r\n     \"Our friend had a copy of the German note made by his secretary,\r\n     and then forwarded it to Haldane. In the course of the evening the\r\n     latter sent an acknowledgment of its receipt, from which Sir\r\n     Ernest read out to me the words: 'So far very good.' It was evident\r\n     that his friend's opinion had favourably influenced his own views\r\n     on the German note.\r\n\r\n     \"On Tuesday Sir Ernest and Lord Haldane drove to the former's house\r\n     after having attended Thanksgiving Service. Lord Haldane stayed for\r\n     lunch, and was just leaving when I arrived at 3 o'clock. He did not\r\n     want to be accompanied by a naval expert, for, although he did not\r\n     pretend to understand all the technical details, he said that he\r\n     knew all that was necessary for the discussion. He stated that he\r\n     would put all his cards on the table and speak quite frankly.\r\n\r\n     \"Our friend spoke of our German politics in most disparaging terms,\r\n     saying that they had been worth nothing since Bismarck's time. What\r\n     Ballin had attained in his dealings with the shipping companies was\r\n     far superior to all the achievements of Germany's diplomatists.\"\r\n\r\nThe positive information which this report contained was passed on to\r\nthe Chancellor.\r\n\r\nBy way of explanation it may be added that the German Navy Bill, which\r\nlater on, at the end of March, 1912, was laid before the Reichstag,\r\nprovided for the formation of a third active squadron in order to adapt\r\nthe increase in the number of the crews to the increase in the material.\r\nThis third squadron necessitated the addition of three new battleships\r\nand of two small cruisers, and it was also intended to increase the\r\nnumber of submarines and to make provision for the construction of\r\nairships.\r\n\r\nThe discussions with Lord Haldane took place at the Royal Castle,\r\nBerlin, on February 9th, the Kaiser being in the chair. The Chancellor\r\ndid not attend, he had a separate interview with Haldane. The outcome of\r\nthe conference is described in a statement from an authoritative source,\r\nviz. in a note which the Kaiser dispatched to Ballin by special\r\nmessenger immediately after the close of the conference. It reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"THE CASTLE, BERLIN.\r\n\"9.2.1912. 6 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BALLIN,\r\n\r\n     \"The conversation has taken place, and all the pros and many cons\r\n     have been discussed. Our standpoint has been explained in great\r\n     detail, and the Bill has been examined. At my suggestion, it was\r\n     resolved to agree on the following basis (informal line of action):\r\n\r\n     \"(1) Because of its scope and its importance, the Agreement must be\r\n     concluded, and it must not be jeopardized by too many details.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) Therefore, the Agreement is not to contain any reference to\r\n     the size of the two fleets, to standards of ships, to\r\n     constructions, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"(3) The Agreement is to be purely political.\r\n\r\n     \"(4) As soon as the Agreement has been published here, and as soon\r\n     as the Bill has been laid before the Reichstag, I, in my character\r\n     of commander-in-chief, instruct Tirpitz to make the following\r\n     statement to the Committee: The third squadron will be asked for\r\n     and voted, but the building of the three additional units required\r\n     to complete it will not be started until 1913, and one ship each\r\n     will be demanded in 1916 and 1919 respectively.\r\n\r\n     \"Haldane agreed to this and expressed his satisfaction. I have made\r\n     no end of concessions. But this must be the limit. He was very nice\r\n     and very reasonable, and he perfectly understood my position as\r\n     commander-in-chief, and that of Tirpitz, with regard to the Bill. I\r\n     really think I have done all I could do.\r\n\r\n     \"Please remember me to Cassel and inform him.\r\n\r\n\"Your sincere friend,\r\n\"(_Signed_) WILHELM I.R.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Haldane's departure from Berlin there was a gap of\r\nconsiderable length in the negotiations which had made such a promising\r\nstart, and unfortunately during that time Mr. Churchill made a speech\r\nwhich not only the German papers but also the Liberal Press in Great\r\nBritain described as wanting in discretion. The passage which German\r\nopinion resented most of all was the statement that, in contrast with\r\nGreat Britain, for whom a big navy was an absolute necessity, to Germany\r\nsuch navy was merely a luxury.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the following two letters from the Chancellor to Ballin\r\nmay throw some light on the causes of the break in the negotiations:\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN.\r\n\"2.3.1912.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MR. BALLIN,\r\n\r\n     \"Our supposition that it is the contents of the Bill which have\r\n     brought about the change of feeling is confirmed by news from a\r\n     private source. It is feared that the Bill as it stands will have\r\n     such an adverse influence on public opinion that the latter will\r\n     not accept a political agreement along with it. Nevertheless, the\r\n     idea of an understanding has not been lost sight of, even though it\r\n     may take six months or a year before it can be accomplished.\r\n\r\n     \"In consequence of this information the draft reply to London\r\n     requires to be reconsidered, and it has not been dispatched so far.\r\n     I shall let you know as soon as it has left.\r\n\r\n\"Sincerely yours.\r\n\"(_Signed_) BETHMANN-HOLLWEG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN.\r\n\"8.3.1912.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MR. BALLIN,\r\n\r\n     \"This is intended for your confidential information. Regarding the\r\n     naval question Great Britain now, as always, lays great stress on\r\n     the difficulty of reconciling public opinion to the inconsistency\r\n     implied by a big increase in the Naval Estimates hand in hand with\r\n     the conclusion of a political and colonial agreement. However, even\r\n     if an agreement should not be reached, she hopes that the\r\n     confidential relations and the frank exchange of opinions between\r\n     both Governments which have resulted from Lord Haldane's mission\r\n     may continue in future. The question of a colonial understanding is\r\n     to be discussed in the near future.\r\n\r\n     \"It is imperative that the negotiations should not break down.\r\n     Success is possible in spite of the Navy Bill if the discussions\r\n     are carried on dispassionately. As matters stand, the provisions\r\n     of the Bill must remain as they are. Great Britain has no right to\r\n     interfere with our views on the number of the crews which we desire\r\n     to place on board our existing units. As far as the building dates\r\n     of the three battleships are concerned, I should have preferred--as\r\n     you are aware--to leave our hands untied, but His Majesty's\r\n     decision has definitely fixed 1913 and 1916 as the years for laying\r\n     them down. This is a far-reaching concession to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"Discreet support from private quarters will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n     \"Many thanks for your news. You know that and why I was prevented\r\n     from writing these last few days.\r\n\r\n\"Sincerely yours,\r\n\"(_Signed_) BETHMANN-HOLLWEG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to find out whether any foreign influence might have been at\r\nwork in London, I was commissioned to meet Sir Ernest Cassel in the\r\nSouth of Europe early in March. Ballin supplied me with a letter\r\ncontaining a detailed account of the general situation. Owing to a delay\r\nin the proposed meeting, I took the precaution of burning the letter, as\r\nI had been instructed to do, and I informed Sir Ernest of its contents\r\nby word of mouth.\r\n\r\nIn this document Ballin gave a brief résumé of the situation as it\r\nappeared to him after his consultations with the various competent\r\ndepartments in Berlin, somewhat on the following lines:\r\n\r\n(1) After Lord Haldane's return Sir Edward Grey officially told Count\r\nMetternich that he was highly pleased with the successful issue of Lord\r\nHaldane's mission, and gave him to understand that he thought it\r\nunlikely that any difficulties would arise.\r\n\r\n(2) A few days later Mr. Asquith made a statement in the House of\r\nCommons which amply confirmed the views held by Sir Edward Grey, and\r\nwhich produced a most favourable impression in Berlin.\r\n\r\n(3) This induced the Chancellor to make an equally amicable and hopeful\r\nstatement to the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n(4) In spite of this, however, there arose an interval of several weeks,\r\nduring which neither Count Metternich nor anybody in Berlin received any\r\nnews from the proper department in London. This silence naturally caused\r\nsome uneasiness.\r\n\r\n(5) Count Metternich was asked to call at the Foreign Office, where Sir\r\nEdward Grey commenced to raise objections mainly in reference to the\r\nNavy Bill. \"I must add in this connexion--as, no doubt, Lord Haldane has\r\nalso told you verbally--that on the last day of his stay in Berlin an\r\nunderstanding was arrived at between the competent quarters on our side\r\nand Lord Haldane with regard to the building dates of the three\r\nbattleships. As you will remember, it had been agreed not to discuss the\r\nproposed establishment of the third squadron on an active footing and\r\nthe increase in the number of the crews connected with it, but to look\r\nupon these subjects as lying outside the negotiations.\" Quite suddenly\r\nand quite unexpectedly we are now faced with a great change in the\r\nsituation. Grey, as I have said before, objects--in terms of the\r\ngreatest politeness, of course--to the increase in the number of the\r\ncrews, asks questions as to our intentions with regard to torpedo boats\r\nand submarines, and--this is most significant--emphasizes that the\r\nHaldane mission has at any rate been of great use, even if the\r\nnegotiations should not lead to any definite result.\r\n\r\n(6) The next event was a further interview with Count Metternich during\r\nwhich it was stated that, according to the calculations of the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, the increase in the number of the crews amounted\r\nto 15,000 men, whilst it had been thought in England that it would be a\r\nquestion of from 4,000 to 5,000 men at the outset. It appeared that this\r\nlarge increase was looked upon with misgivings, and that it was desired\r\nto enter into fresh negotiations which would greatly interfere with the\r\narrangements made by the German competent quarters with regard to the\r\nnavy. Hence Metternich replied that, in his opinion, these explanations\r\ncould only mean that the Cabinet did not agree to the arrangements made\r\nby Lord Haldane. Grey's answer was full of polite assurances couched in\r\nthe language of diplomacy, but, translated into plain German, what he\r\nmeant was: \"You are quite right.\"\r\n\r\nBallin's letter went on to say that the German Navy Bill had gradually\r\nbeen reduced to a minimum, and that it was not possible to cut it down\r\nany further. We could not, and we would not, give rise to the suspicion\r\nthat great alterations had been made merely to meet British objections.\r\nFinally, Ballin requested his friend to go to London in order to make\r\ninquiries on the spot, and also declared his readiness to go there\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMy report on my conversations with Sir Ernest Cassel, which took place\r\nat Marseilles on March 9th and 10th, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Our friend arrived about four hours late, but he received me all\r\n     the same at 10 P.M. on that evening. I told him all about my\r\n     journey and related to him verbally the contents of Ballin's\r\n     letter. When I described the incident of how Grey had raised new\r\n     objections at his interview with Metternich, and when I explained\r\n     how, after that, the matter had come to a dead stop, so that\r\n     nothing further was heard of it in Germany, our friend interrupted\r\n     me by saying that since then the British Government had presented a\r\n     memorandum containing the objections raised against the German Navy\r\n     Bill. The latter, he suggested, was the only stumbling-block, as\r\n     could be inferred from a letter which he had received _en route_\r\n     from Haldane.\r\n\r\n     \"When I remarked that Ballin, in a postscript to his letter, had\r\n     expressed an apprehension lest some foreign influence had\r\n     interfered with the course of events, our friend positively denied\r\n     this. France, he said, was on good terms with Great Britain, and\r\n     had no reason for intriguing against an Anglo-German agreement\r\n     destined, as it was, to promote the cause of peace.\r\n\r\n     \"When I then proceeded with my account, drawing his special\r\n     attention to the reduction of the estimates contained in the Navy\r\n     Bill, Sir Ernest interposed that he was not sufficiently _au\r\n     courant_ as to the details. He himself, in his statement prepared\r\n     for the British Government, had only referred to the battleships,\r\n     and he thought he had perhaps given too cursory an account of the\r\n     other factors of the case. He also threw out some fairly plain\r\n     hints that Haldane had gone too far in Berlin, and that he had made\r\n     statements on a subject with which he was not sufficiently\r\n     conversant. Later on, he continued, the Navy Bill had been\r\n     subjected to a careful examination by the British Admiralty, and\r\n     before his departure from Cannes he, Sir Ernest, had received a\r\n     letter from Mr. Churchill, the tone of which was very angry.\r\n     Churchill complained that Germany had presented such a long list of\r\n     the wishes with which she wanted Great Britain to comply, that the\r\n     least one could hope for was an accommodating spirit in the\r\n     question of the Navy. Everything now depended on Churchill; if he\r\n     could be satisfied, all the rest would be plain sailing. He and\r\n     Lloyd George were the greatest friends of the agreement. Sir Ernest\r\n     also made it fairly clear that Great Britain would be content with\r\n     a postponement of the building dates, or in other words with a\r\n     'retardation of the building programme.' The negotiations would be\r\n     bound to fail, unless Ballin could secure such a postponement. It\r\n     was necessary to strike whilst the iron was hot, and this\r\n     particular iron had already become rather cool. He quite accepted\r\n     Grey's statement that the Haldane mission had not been in vain, as\r\n     the feeling had doubtless become more friendly since then. Some few\r\n     individual indiscretions, such as Churchill's reference to the\r\n     German Navy as an article of luxury, should not be taken too\r\n     seriously. If the German Bill were passed into law in its present\r\n     shape, the British Government would be obliged to introduce one\r\n     asking for three times as much, but it could not possibly do this\r\n     and declare at the same time that it had reached an understanding\r\n     with Germany. Such a proceeding would be absurd. The argument that\r\n     it is inconsistent with common sense to conclude an agreement and\r\n     yet to continue one's armaments, is evidently still maintained in\r\n     Great Britain, and is one which, of course, it is impossible to\r\n     refute.\r\n\r\n     \"In the course of our conversation Sir Ernest produced the letter\r\n     which he had received from Haldane _en route_. This letter stated\r\n     that the discussions with Metternich were then chiefly on the\r\n     subject of the Navy Bill, and that the Admiralty had prepared a\r\n     memorandum for the German Government dealing with these questions.\r\n     The letter was dated February 25th, and its tone was not\r\n     pessimistic; Churchill, however, as stated above, had previously\r\n     written him a 'very angry' letter. In this connexion it must not be\r\n     forgotten that the man on whom everything depends is not the\r\n     amiable negotiator Haldane, but Churchill.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to make further inquiries about the state of things and to\r\nassist in promoting the good cause, Ballin, immediately after my return,\r\nproceeded to Paris and then to London. He reported to the Chancellor\r\nupon the impressions he had received in Paris. The following is an\r\nextract from his report:\r\n\r\n     \"Owing to the brief time at my disposal when I was in Paris, I\r\n     could only learn the views of the members of the '_haute finance_.'\r\n     It is well known that in France the attitude taken up by financial\r\n     circles is always regarded as authoritative. They look upon the\r\n     present situation as decidedly pacific; they are pleased that the\r\n     Morocco affair is settled, and they feel quite sure that the\r\n     political sky is unclouded by complications. They would gladly\r\n     welcome an agreement between Germany and Great Britain. My friends\r\n     assure me that the Government also does not view the idea of such\r\n     an understanding with displeasure; on the contrary, it looks upon\r\n     it as an advantage. It is, however, thought unlikely that an\r\n     agreement will be reached, because it is believed that popular\r\n     feeling in Germany is too much opposed to it. If, notwithstanding\r\n     these pacific views held by influential and competent sections, the\r\n     casual visitor to the French capital is impressed by a certain\r\n     bellicose attitude of the nation as a whole, it is largely due to\r\n     the propaganda carried on by the _Matin_ with the purpose of\r\n     obtaining voluntary subscriptions for the furtherance of aviation.\r\n     The French are enthusiastic over this idea, and as it has a strong\r\n     military bearing, the man in the street likes to connect the French\r\n     aviation successes with a victorious war.\"\r\n\r\nFrom London Ballin sent me some telegrams which I was instructed to pass\r\non to the Chancellor. In these messages he stated that his conversations\r\nwith the German Ambassador and with Haldane had convinced him that\r\npeople in London believed that the increase in the number of the crews,\r\nif the proposed German Navy Bill became law, would be greater than the\r\nfigures given by Berlin would make it appear. It would therefore be most\r\ndesirable to arrange for a meeting of experts to clear up this\r\ndiscrepancy. Ballin's impression was that the British Cabinet, and also\r\nthe King, were still favourably disposed to the whole plan, and that the\r\nCabinet was unanimous in this view. A conversation with Churchill, which\r\nlasted several hours, confirmed these impressions. In London the\r\nincrease in the number of the crews had previously been estimated at\r\nhalf of what it would really be, and alarm was felt about the large\r\nnumber of torpedo boats and submarines demanded; but since the German\r\nGovernment had explained that the figures arrived at in London--i.e.\r\nthose stated in the memorandum which had been addressed to the German\r\nGovernment some time before--were not correct, Churchill had agreed that\r\nboth sides should nominate experts who would check the figures and put\r\nthem right. Churchill was anxious to see that the matter was brought to\r\na successful issue, and he was still hoping that a neutrality agreement\r\nwould induce the German Government to make concessions in regard to the\r\nNavy Bill.\r\n\r\nWhen Ballin had satisfied himself as to this state of things, he\r\nimmediately returned to Berlin, as he did not consider it appropriate\r\nthat any private person should do anything further for the time being,\r\nand as he thought that the conduct of the discussions concerning the\r\nneutrality agreement were best left to the Ambassador.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the German Government had definitely made up its\r\nmind that the Navy Bill would have to remain as it stood. This was the\r\ninformation Ballin received from the Kaiser and the Chancellor when he\r\nreturned from London on March 16th.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Cassel then suggested to the British Government that the\r\nnegotiations concerning the neutrality agreement should be re-opened as\r\nsoon as the first excitement caused by the Navy Bill had subsided, which\r\nwould probably be the case within a few months, and that the interval\r\nshould be utilized for clearing up the details. In Berlin, however, the\r\ndiscussions were looked upon as having been broken off, as may be seen\r\nfrom the following telegram which the Kaiser sent to Ballin on March\r\n19th in reply to Ballin's information about his last exchange of\r\ntelegrams with London:\r\n\r\n     \"Many thanks for letter. The latest proposals arriving here\r\n     immediately after you had left raised impossible demands and were\r\n     so offensive in form that they were promptly rejected. Further harm\r\n     was done by Churchill's arrogant speech which a large section of\r\n     the British press justly described as a provocation of Germany. The\r\n     'agreement' has thus been broken by Great Britain, and we have done\r\n     with it. The negotiations must be started afresh on quite a\r\n     different basis. What apology has there been offered to us for the\r\n     passage in the speech describing our fleet as an article of luxury?\r\n\r\n\"(_Signed_) WILHELM I.R.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the negotiations had actually been broken off was confirmed to\r\nBallin by a letter of the Chancellor of the same date:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MR. BALLIN,\r\n\r\n     \"My cordial thanks for your letter of the 18th. What your friend\r\n     told Metternich is identical with what he wired you. Churchill's\r\n     speech did not come up to my expectations. He really seems to be a\r\n     firebrand past praying for. The Army and Navy Bills will probably\r\n     not go up to the Federal Council until the 21st, as the Army Bill\r\n     requires some amendments at the eleventh hour. Their contents will\r\n     be published simultaneously.\r\n\r\n     \"My opinion is that our labours will now have to be stopped\r\n     altogether for some time. The problem before us suffers from the\r\n     defect that, because of its inherent difficulties, it admits of no\r\n     solution. I shall always remain sincerely grateful to you for your\r\n     loyal assistance. When you come to Berlin next time, please don't\r\n     forget to call at the Wilhelmstrasse.\r\n\r\n\"With kindest regards,\r\n\"Sincerely yours,\r\n\"(_Signed_) BETHMANN-HOLLWEG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conviction of the inherent impossibility of solving the problem was\r\nshared by many people in Germany--chiefly, of course, by those connected\r\nwith the Navy; and some critics went so far as to say that Great Britain\r\nhad never honestly meant to arrive at an understanding, or at any rate\r\nthat Haldane--whose honesty and sincerity were beyond doubt--was\r\ndisowned by his fellow-members in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhen Ballin, in compliance with the wishes of the Foreign Office, went\r\nto London during the critical period before the outbreak of the war in\r\n1914, he wrote a letter from there to a naval officer of high rank with\r\nwhom he had been on terms of friendship for years. This document is of\r\ninterest now because it shows what Ballin's own standpoint was with\r\nregard to the views described in the previous paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"People over here,\" he wrote, \"do not believe that negotiations\r\n     with Great Britain on the subject of a naval agreement could\r\n     possibly be crowned with success, and you yourself contend that it\r\n     would have been better if such negotiations had never been started.\r\n     Your standpoint is that the failure of any efforts in that\r\n     direction would merely tend to aggravate the existing situation, a\r\n     point of view with which I entirely concur.\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand, however, you cannot deny the soundness of the\r\n     argument that, if the responsible leaders of British naval policy\r\n     keep expressing their desire to enter into a discussion, the\r\n     refusal of Germany to do so must cause the British to believe that\r\n     we are pursuing aims far exceeding those we have openly avowed. My\r\n     somewhat fatigued brain is unable to see whether the German\r\n     contention is right or wrong. But naturally, I always look upon\r\n     things from the business man's point of view, and so I always think\r\n     it better to come to some kind of an agreement with a competitor\r\n     rather than allow him an unlimited measure of expansion. Once,\r\n     however, I have come to the conclusion that for financial or other\r\n     reasons this competitor can no longer keep pace with me, his\r\n     further existence ceases altogether to interest me.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus the views of the expert on these matters and those of the\r\n     business man run counter to each other, and I am entitled to\r\n     dismiss this subject without entering upon a discussion of the\r\n     interesting and remarkable arguments which Winston Churchill put\r\n     before me last night. I cannot, however, refrain from contradicting\r\n     by a few brief words the contention that the motives which had\r\n     prompted the Haldane mission were not sincere. A conversation with\r\n     Sir Edward Grey the night before last has strengthened this\r\n     conviction of mine still further. I regard Sir Edward as a serious,\r\n     honest, and clever statesman, and I am sure you will agree with my\r\n     view that the Haldane mission has cleared the atmosphere\r\n     surrounding Anglo-German relations which had become very strained.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that history, in the meantime, has proved whose\r\nstandpoint was the correct one: that of the business man or that of the\r\nnaval expert.\r\n\r\nNot much need be said about the subsequent development of events up to\r\nthe outbreak of the war.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned opinion which the Chancellor held regarding\r\nChurchill's speech of March 18th, 1912, was probably arrived at on the\r\nstrength of the cabled reports only. Whoever reads the full original\r\ntext of the speech must fail to find anything aggressive in it, and\r\nthere was no harm in admitting that it was a perfectly frank and honest\r\nstatement concerning the naval rivalry of the two Powers. Among other\r\nthings it contained the suggestion that a \"naval holiday\" should be\r\nagreed upon, i.e. both countries should abstain from building new ships\r\nfor a definite period. We, at any rate, looked upon Churchill's speech\r\nas a suitable means of making people see what would be the ultimate\r\nconsequences of the interminable naval armaments. I made a German\r\ntranslation of it which, with the aid of one of the committees for an\r\nAnglo-German understanding, I spread broadcast all over the country.\r\nHowever, it proved a complete failure, as there were powerful groups in\r\nboth countries who contended that the efforts to reconcile the two\r\nstandpoints could not lead to any positive result, and that the old\r\ninjunction, _si vis pacem, para bellum_, indicated the only right\r\nsolution. Only a master mind could have overcome these difficulties. But\r\nHerr v. Bethmann, as we know, considered that the problem, for inherent\r\nreasons, did not admit of any solution at all, and the Kaiser's initial\r\nenthusiasm had probably been damped by subsequent influences of a\r\ndifferent kind. Ballin himself, in later years, ascribed the failure of\r\nthe mission to the circumstance that the Kaiser and his Chancellor,\r\nbetween themselves only, had attempted to bring the whole matter to a\r\nsuccessful issue instead of entrusting this task to the Secretary of\r\nForeign Affairs and to Admiral Tirpitz, the Secretary for the Navy.\r\n\r\nAn interesting sidelight on the causes which led to the failure of this\r\nlast important attempt to reach an understanding is thrown by the\r\nrumours which were spread in the German Press in March, 1912, to the\r\neffect that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Herr v.\r\nKiderlen, wished to resign, because he felt that he had been left too\r\nmuch in the dark with regard to the Anglo-German negotiations. It was\r\nalso reported that the Chancellor's position had been shaken, and that\r\nAdmiral Tirpitz felt dissatisfied, because the Navy Bill did not go far\r\nenough. Probably there was some vestige of truth in all these rumours,\r\nand this may have been connected with the attitude which the three\r\ngentlemen concerned had taken up towards the question of the\r\nnegotiations with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nShortly after the visit of Lord Haldane Ballin received a letter from a\r\npersonage belonging to the Kaiser's entourage in which it was said:\r\n\r\n     \"The impression which has taken root with me during the many hours\r\n     which I spent as an attentive listener is that your broad-minded\r\n     scheme is being wrecked by our official circles, partly through\r\n     their clumsiness, and partly through their bureaucratic conceit,\r\n     and--which is worse--that we have failed to show ourselves worthy\r\n     of the great opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it had become certain that the last attempt to reach an\r\nunderstanding had definitely and finally failed, the ambassador in\r\nLondon, Count Metternich, did not shrink from drawing the only possible\r\nconclusion from it. He had always expressed his conviction that a war\r\nbetween Germany and a Franco-Russian coalition would find Great Britain\r\non the side of Germany's opponents, and his resignation--which, as\r\nusual, was explained by the state of his health--was really due to a\r\nreport of his in which he stated it as his opinion that a continuation\r\nof German armaments would lead to war with Great Britain no later than\r\n1915. It is alleged that the Kaiser added a very \"ungracious\" marginal\r\nnote to this report. Consequently, the ambassador, who was a man of very\r\nindependent character, did the only thing he could consistently do, and\r\nresigned his office. In taking this step he may have been influenced by\r\nthe reception which the failure of the Haldane mission met with in\r\nConservative circles in Great Britain, where no stone was left unturned\r\nto urge the necessity for continuing the policy of big armaments and to\r\npaint German untrustworthiness in the most glaring colours.\r\n\r\nCount Metternich's successor was Herr v. Marschall, a gentleman whose\r\nappointment the Press and the official circles welcomed with great\r\ncordiality, and from whose considerable diplomatic abilities, which were\r\nacknowledged on all sides, an improvement of Anglo-German relations was\r\nconfidently expected. It was said that the Kaiser had sent \"his best\r\nman,\" thus demonstrating how greatly he also desired better relations.\r\nBut Herr v. Marschall's activities came to a sudden end through his\r\nearly death in September, 1912, and in October his place was taken by\r\nPrince Lichnowsky, whose efforts in the direction of an improvement in\r\nthe relations are familiar to everyone who has read his pamphlet. Apart\r\nfrom the work performed by the ambassadors, great credit is also due to\r\nthe activities displayed by Herr v. Kühlmann, the then Secretary to the\r\nLegation and subsequent Secretary of State. The public did not see a\r\ndeal of his work, which was conducted with skill and was consistent. His\r\nclose personal acquaintance with some of the leading British\r\npoliticians, especially with Sir Edward Grey, enabled him to do much\r\nwork for the maintenance of good relations and in the interest of\r\nEuropean peace, particularly during the time when the post of ambassador\r\nwas vacant, and also during the Balkan War. He had, moreover, a great\r\ndeal to do with the drafting of the two colonial agreements dealing with\r\nthe Bagdad Railway and the African problems respectively, both of which\r\nwere ready for signature in the summer of 1914. The former especially\r\nmay be looked upon as a proof not only that a considerable improvement\r\nhad taken place in Anglo-German relations, but also that Great Britain\r\nwas not inclined to adjust the guiding lines of her policy in Asia Minor\r\nexclusively in conformity with the wishes of Russia. Anybody who takes\r\nan interest in the then existing possibilities of German expansion with\r\nthe consent of Great Britain and on the basis of these colonial draft\r\nagreements cannot do better than read the anonymous pamphlet entitled\r\n\"_Deutsche Weltpolitik und kein Krieg_\" (\"German World Power and No\r\nWar\"), published in 1913 by Messrs. Puttkamer & Mühlbrecht, of Berlin.\r\nThe author is Dr. Plehn, the then representative of the _Cologne\r\nGazette_ in London, and it partly reflects the views of Herr v.\r\nKühlmann.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion I should like to refer briefly to an episode which\r\ntook place towards the close of 1912. The German periodicals have\r\nalready discussed it, especially the _Süddeutsche Monatshafte_ in June,\r\n1921, in a review of the reports which Count Lerchenfeld, the Bavarian\r\nminister to the Court of Berlin, had made for the information of his\r\nGovernment. In these reports he mentions an event to which the Kaiser\r\nhad already referred in a letter to Ballin dated December 15th, 1912.\r\nThe Kaiser, in commenting on the state of tension then existing between\r\nAustria and Serbia, made some significant remarks concerning the policy\r\nof Germany towards Austria-Hungary. When the relations between Vienna\r\nand Petrograd, he wrote, had assumed a dangerous character, because it\r\nwas recognized that the attitude of Serbia was based on her hope of\r\nRussian support, Germany might be faced with the possibility of having\r\nto come to the assistance of Austria.\r\n\r\n     \"The Slav subjects of Austria,\" the letter continued, \"had become\r\n     very restless, and could only be brought to reason by the resolute\r\n     action of the whole Dual Monarchy against Serbia. Austria had\r\n     arrived at the cross roads, and her whole future development hung\r\n     in the balance. Either the German element would retain its\r\n     ascendancy, in which case she would remain a suitable ally, or the\r\n     Slav element would gain the upper hand, and she would cease to be\r\n     an ally altogether. If we were compelled to take up arms, we should\r\n     do so to assist Austria not only against Russian aggression, but\r\n     also against the Slavs in general, and in her efforts to remain\r\n     German. That would mean that we should have to face a racial\r\n     struggle of the Germanic element against Slav insolence. It is\r\n     beyond our power to prevent this struggle, because the future of\r\n     the Habsburg monarchy and that of our own country are both at\r\n     stake. (This was the real meaning of Bethmann's very plain\r\n     speaking.) It is therefore a question on which depends the very\r\n     existence of the Germanic race on the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n     \"It was of great importance to us that Great Britain had so far\r\n     supported the Austro-German standpoint in these matters. Now, since\r\n     a war against Russia would automatically imply a war with France as\r\n     well, it was of interest to us to know whether, in this purely\r\n     continental case, Great Britain could and would declare her\r\n     neutrality in conformity with her proposals of last February.\r\n\r\n     \"On December 6th, Haldane, obviously sent by Grey, called on\r\n     Lichnowsky and explained to the dumbfounded ambassador in plain\r\n     words that, assuming Germany getting involved in war against Russia\r\n     and France, Great Britain would _not_ remain neutral, but would at\r\n     once come to the assistance of France. The reason given for this\r\n     attitude was that Britain could not and would not tolerate at any\r\n     time that we should acquire a position of continental predominance\r\n     which might easily lead to the formation of a united continent.\r\n     Great Britain could therefore never allow France to be crushed by\r\n     us. You can imagine the effect of this piece of news on the whole\r\n     of the Wilhelmstrasse. I cannot say that I was taken by surprise,\r\n     because I, as you know, have always looked upon Great Britain as an\r\n     enemy in a military sense. Still, this news has decidedly cleared\r\n     matters up, even if the result is merely of a negative character.\"\r\n\r\nBallin did not omit to ask his friend for some details concerning the\r\nvisit of Lord Haldane mentioned in the Kaiser's letter, and was\r\nfurnished with the following explanation by Lord Haldane himself.\r\n\r\nNothing had been further from his intentions, he said, than to call on\r\nPrince Lichnowsky for the express purpose of making any such\r\ndeclaration; and Balkan questions, to the best of his recollection, had\r\nnot been touched at all. He had spent a very pleasant half-hour with the\r\nPrince, and in the course of their conversation he had seen fit to\r\nrepeat the formula which had been discussed during his stay in Berlin,\r\nand which referred to Britain's interest in the preservation of the\r\nintegrity of France. This, possibly, might have given rise to the\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nPrince Lichnowsky himself, in his pamphlet entitled \"My London Mission,\"\r\nrelates the incident as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"In my dispatches sent to Berlin I pointed out again and again that\r\n     Great Britain, being a commercial country, would suffer enormously\r\n     through any war between the European Powers, and would prevent it\r\n     by every means within her power. At the same time, however, she\r\n     could never tolerate the weakening or the crushing of France,\r\n     because it would disturb the Balance of Power and replace it by the\r\n     ascendancy of Germany. This view had been expressed to me by Lord\r\n     Haldane shortly after my arrival, and everybody whose opinion\r\n     counts for anything told me the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe failure of the negotiations aiming at an understanding led to a\r\ncontinuance of the increase in the British armaments, a concentration of\r\nthe British battle fleet in the North Sea, and to that of the French\r\nfleet in the Mediterranean. The latter arrangement was looked upon in\r\nGermany as a menace directed against Italy, and produced a sharp\r\nsemi-official criticism in the _Frankfurter Zeitung_. In spite of all\r\nthis, however, friendly messages from London concerning the\r\npossibilities of an understanding, the \"naval holiday,\" etc., reached\r\nGermany from time to time.\r\n\r\nHow closely Ballin clung to his favourite idea that the naval experts of\r\nboth countries should come to an understanding is demonstrated by the\r\ncircumstance that in 1914, when the British squadron was present during\r\nthe Kiel yachting week, he tried to bring about a meeting and a personal\r\nexchange of views between Churchill and Tirpitz.\r\n\r\nChurchill was by no means disinclined to come to Germany for this\r\npurpose, but unfortunately the desire was expressed by the German side,\r\nand especially by the Kaiser, that the British Government should make an\r\nofficial inquiry whether his visit would be welcomed. The Government,\r\nhowever, was not disposed to do so, and the whole thing fell through,\r\nalthough Churchill sent word that, if Tirpitz really wanted to see him,\r\nhe would find means to bring about such a meeting.\r\n\r\nThus the last attempt at an understanding had resulted in failure, and\r\nbefore any further efforts in the same direction could be made, Europe\r\nhad been overtaken by its fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE KAISER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the friendship between Ballin and the Kaiser, which has\r\ngiven rise to so much comment and to so many rumours, was traced back by\r\nthe Kaiser himself to the year 1891, when he inspected the express\r\nsteamer _Auguste Victoria_, and when he, accompanied by the Kaiserin,\r\nmade a trip on board the newly-built express steamer _Fürst Bismarck_.\r\nBallin, although he received the honour of a decoration and a few\r\ngracious words from His Majesty, did not think that this meeting had\r\nestablished any special contact between himself and his sovereign. He\r\ntold me, indeed, that he dated their acquaintance from a memorable\r\nmeeting which took place in Berlin in 1895, and which was concerned with\r\nthe preparations for the festivities in celebration of the opening of\r\nthe Kiel Canal.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser wanted the event to be as magnificent as possible, and his\r\nwishes to this effect were fully met by the Hamburg civic authorities\r\nand by the shipping companies. Although Ballin had only been a short\r\ntime in the position he then held, his versatile mind did not overlook\r\nthe opportunity thus offered for advertising his company. The Kaiser was\r\nkeenly interested in every detail. After some preliminary discussions\r\nwith the Hamburg Senate, all the interested parties were invited to send\r\ntheir delegates to Berlin, where a general meeting was to be held in the\r\nRoyal Castle with the Kaiser in the chair. It was arranged that the\r\nNorth German Lloyd and the Hamburg-Amerika Linie should provide one\r\nsteamer each, which was to convey the representatives of the Government\r\ndepartments and of the Reichstag, as well as the remaining guests,\r\nexcept those who were to be accommodated on board the _Hohenzollern_,\r\nand that both steamers should follow in the wake of the latter all the\r\nway down the Elbe from Hamburg to the Canal. When this item was\r\ndiscussed the Kaiser said he had arranged that the _Hohenzollern_ should\r\nbe followed first by the Lloyd steamer and then by the Hamburg-Amerika\r\nliner. Thereupon Ballin asked leave to speak. He explained that, since\r\nthe journey was to start in Hamburg territorial waters, it would perhaps\r\nbe proper to extend to the Hamburg company the honour of the position\r\nimmediately after the Imperial yacht. The Kaiser, in a tone which\r\nsounded by no means gracious, declared that he did not think this was\r\nnecessary, and that he had already given a definite promise to the Lloyd\r\npeople. Ballin replied that, if the Kaiser had pledged his word, the\r\nmatter, of course, was settled, and that he would withdraw his\r\nsuggestion, although he considered himself justified in making it.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the meeting Count Waldersee, who had been one of those\r\npresent, took Ballin's arm and said to him: \"As you are now sure to be\r\nhanged from the Brandenburger Tor, let us go to Hiller's before it comes\r\noff, to have some lunch together.\" Ballin never ceased to be grateful to\r\nthe Count for this sign of kindness, and his friendship with him and his\r\nfamily lasted until his death. The arrangements made by the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie for the reception of its guests were carefully\r\nprepared and carried out. It is not easy to give an idea to a non-expert\r\nof the great many minute details which have to be attended to in order\r\nto accommodate a large number of exacting visitors on a steamer in such\r\na manner that nobody finds anything to complain of, especially if, as is\r\nbut natural on an occasion such as this, an endless variety of\r\nquestions as to precedence and etiquette have to be taken into account.\r\nGreat pains and much circumspection are necessary to arrange to\r\neverybody's satisfaction all matters affecting the reception of the\r\nguests, the provision of food and drinks, the conveyance of luggage,\r\netc. Thanks to the infinite care, however, with which Ballin and his\r\nfellow-workers attended to this matter, everything turned out eminently\r\nsatisfactory. In the evening, when the guests of the Hamburg-Amerika\r\nLinie were returning to their steamer at the close of the festivities,\r\nthe company agreeably surprised them by providing an artistically\r\narranged collation of cold meats, etc., and the news of this spread so\r\nquickly that from the other vessels people who felt that the official\r\ncatering had not taken sufficient account of their appetites, lost no\r\ntime in availing themselves of this opportunity of a meal.\r\n\r\nThis event, at any rate, helped to establish the reputation of the\r\ncompany's hospitality.\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that this incident had shown the Kaiser--who,\r\nalthough he did not object to being contradicted in private, could not\r\nbear it in public--that the Hamburg Company was animated by a spirit of\r\nindependence which did not subordinate itself to other influences\r\nwithout a protest, and which jealously guarded its position. It must be\r\nstated that the Kaiser never bore Ballin any ill will on account of his\r\nopposition, which may be partly due to the great pains the Packetfahrt\r\ntook in order to make the festivities a success. The event may also have\r\ninduced the Kaiser to watch the progress of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie\r\nafter that with particular attention. His special interest was centred\r\nround the provision for new construction, and in this matter he exerted\r\nhis influence from an early time in favour of the German yards.\r\n\r\nThe first occasion of the Kaiser's pleading in favour of German yards\r\ndates from the time previous to his accession to the throne. Ballin, in\r\na speech which he delivered when the trial trip of the s.s. _Meteor_\r\ntook place, stated the facts connected with this intervention as\r\nfollows: The directors had just started negotiations with British\r\nshipbuilding firms for the building of their first express steamer when\r\nthe Prussian Minister to the Free City of Hamburg called to inform them,\r\nat the request of Prince Bismarck, that the latter, acting upon the\r\nurgent representations of Prince Wilhelm, suggested that they should\r\nentrust the building of the big vessel to a German yard. The Prince was\r\nprofoundly convinced that Germany, for the sake of her own future, must\r\ncease to play the part of Cinderella among the nations, and that there\r\nwas no want of engineers among his countrymen who, if given a chance,\r\nwould prove just as efficient as their fellow-craftsmen in England. The\r\nPacketfahrt thereupon entrusted the building of the vessel to the\r\nStettin Vulkan yard. She was the fast steamer _Auguste Victoria_, and\r\nwas christened after the young Empress. Launched in 1888, she\r\nimmediately won \"the blue riband of the Atlantic\" on her first trip.\r\n\r\nAnother and still more practical suggestion of the Kaiser was put\r\nforward at the time when the company were about to build an excursion\r\nsteamer. The satisfactory results which their fast steamers had yielded\r\nduring the dead season in the transatlantic passage business when used\r\nfor pleasure cruises had induced them to take this step, and when the\r\nKaiser's attention was drawn to this project, he, on the strength of the\r\nexperience he had made with his _Hohenzollern_, designed a sketch and\r\ncomposed a memorandum dealing with the equipment of such a steamer. It\r\nwas Ballin's opinion that this Imperial memorandum contained some\r\nsuggestions worth studying, although it was but natural that the\r\nmonarch could not be expected to be sufficiently acquainted with all the\r\npractical considerations which the company had to bear in mind in order\r\nto make the innovation pay, and that, therefore, some of his\r\nrecommendations could not be carried out.\r\n\r\nIf we remember what vivid pleasure the Kaiser derived from his own\r\nholiday cruises, it cannot surprise us to see that he took such a keen\r\ninterest in the company's excursion trips. How keen it was may be\r\ninferred from an incident which happened early in his reign, and to\r\nwhich Ballin, when describing his first experiences on this subject,\r\nreferred in his above-mentioned speech on the occasion of the trial trip\r\nof the _Meteor_. Ballin said: \"Even among my most intimate associates\r\npeople were not wanting who thought that I was not quite right in my\r\nmind when, at the head of 241 intrepid travellers, I set out on the\r\nfirst pleasure cruise to the Far East in January, 1891. The Kaiser had\r\njust inspected the vessel, and then bade farewell to the company and\r\nmyself by saying: 'That's right. Make our countrymen feel at home on the\r\nopen sea, and both your company and the whole nation will reap the\r\nbenefit.'\"\r\n\r\nIn after years the Kaiser's interest in the company chiefly centred\r\nround those landmarks in its progress which marked the country's\r\nexpansion in the direction of _Weltpolitik_, e.g. its participation in\r\nthe Imperial Mail Service to the Far East, its taking up a share in the\r\nAfrican trade, etc. In fact, after 1901, when the Kaiser had keenly\r\ninterested himself in the establishment of the Morgan Trust and its\r\nconnexion with German shipping companies, there was scarcely an\r\nimportant event in the history of the company (such as the extension of\r\nits services, the addition of a big new steamer, etc.) which he allowed\r\nto pass without a few cordial words of congratulation. He also took the\r\nliveliest interest in the personal well-being of Ballin. He always sent\r\nhim the compliments of the season at Christmas or for the New Year,\r\ngenerally in the shape of picture post-cards or photographs from his\r\ntravels, together with a few gracious words, and he never failed to\r\nremember the anniversaries of important events in Ballin's life or to\r\ninquire after him on recovering from an illness. Ballin, in his turn,\r\nacquainted the Kaiser with anything which he believed might be of\r\ninterest to His Majesty, or might improve his knowledge of the economic\r\nconditions existing in his own as well as in foreign countries. He kept\r\nhim informed about all the more important pool negotiations, e.g. those\r\nin connexion with the establishment, in 1908, of the general pool, and\r\nthose referring to the agreements concluded with other German shipping\r\ncompanies, etc. Whenever he noticed on his travels any signs of\r\nimportant developments, chiefly those of a political kind, he furnished\r\nhis Imperial friend with reports on the foreign situation.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the Kaiser's interest in Ballin took a particularly practical\r\nform. Ballin had suffered a great deal from neuralgic pains which, in\r\nspite of the treatment of various physicians, did not really and\r\npermanently diminish until the patient was taken in hand by Professor\r\nSchweninger, the famous medical adviser of no less a man than Bismarck.\r\nBallin himself testified to the unvaried attention and kindness of Dr.\r\nSchweninger, and to the great success of his treatment. It is to be\r\nassumed that Schweninger, because of his energetic manner of dealing\r\nwith his patients, was eminently suited to Ballin's disposition, which\r\nwas not an easy one for his doctor and for those round him to cope with.\r\n\r\n     \"As early as January, 1904,\" Ballin remarks in his notes, \"the\r\n     Kaiser had sent a telegram inviting me to attend the _Ordensfest_\r\n     celebrations in Berlin, and during the subsequent levee he favoured\r\n     me with a lengthy conversation, chiefly because he wanted to tell\r\n     me how greatly he was alarmed at the state of my health. His\r\n     physician, Professor Leuthold, had evidently given him an\r\n     unfavourable account of it. The Kaiser explained that he could no\r\n     longer allow me to go on without proper assistance or without a\r\n     substitute who would do my work when I was away for any length of\r\n     time. This state of things caused him a great deal of anxiety, and,\r\n     as it was a matter of national interest, he was bound to occupy\r\n     himself with this problem. He did not wish to expose himself to a\r\n     repetition of the danger--which he had experienced in the Krupp\r\n     case--that a large concern like ours should at any moment be\r\n     without a qualified steersman at the helm. He said he knew that of\r\n     all the gentlemen in his entourage Herr v. Grumme was the one I\r\n     liked best, and that I had an excellent opinion of him. He also\r\n     considered Grumme the best man he had ever had round him, and it\r\n     would be difficult to replace him. Nevertheless he would be glad to\r\n     induce Grumme to join the services of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, if\r\n     I thought that this would solve the difficulty he had just referred\r\n     to, and that such a solution would fall in with my own wishes. He\r\n     was convinced that I should soon be restored to my normal health if\r\n     I were relieved of some part of my work, and that this would enable\r\n     me to do much useful service to the nation and himself; so he would\r\n     be pleased to make the sacrifice. I sincerely thanked His Majesty,\r\n     and assured him that I could not think of any solution that I\r\n     should like better than the one he had proposed, and that, if he\r\n     were really prepared to do so much for me, I would beg him to\r\n     discuss the matter with Grumme. That very evening he sent for\r\n     Grumme, who immediately expressed his readiness to enter the\r\n     services of our company if such was His Majesty's pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThe lively interest which the Kaiser took in the development of our\r\nmercantile marine was naturally closely connected with the growth of the\r\nImperial Navy and with our naval policy in general. The country's\r\nmaritime interests and the merchant fleet were the real motives that\r\nprompted his own naval policy, whereas Tirpitz chiefly looked upon them\r\nas a valuable asset for propaganda purposes. During the first stage of\r\nthe naval policy and of the naval propaganda--which at that time were\r\nconducted on quite moderate lines--Ballin, as he repeatedly told me,\r\nplayed a very active part. It was the time when the well-known\r\nperiodical _Nautikus_, afterwards issued at regular annual intervals,\r\nwas first published by the Ministry for the Navy, and when a very active\r\npropaganda in favour of the navy and of the country's maritime interests\r\nwas started. Experience has proved how difficult it is to start such a\r\npropaganda, especially through the medium of a Press so loosely\r\norganized as was the German Press in those days. But it is still more\r\ndifficult to stop, or even to lessen, such propaganda once it has been\r\nstarted, because the preliminary condition for any active propaganda\r\nwork is that a large number of individual persons and organizations\r\nshould be interested in it. It is next to impossible to induce these\r\npeople to discontinue their activities when it is no longer thought\r\ndesirable to keep up the propaganda after its original aim has been\r\nachieved. Germany's maritime interests remained a favourite subject of\r\nPress discussions, and the animation with which these were carried on\r\nreached a climax whenever a supplementary Navy Bill was introduced. Even\r\nwhen it was intended to widen the Kiel Canal, as it proved too narrow\r\nfor the vessels of the \"Dreadnought\" type, the necessity for doing so\r\nwas explained by reference to the constantly increasing size of the new\r\nsteamers built for the mercantile marine; although, seeing that the\r\nshallow waters of the Baltic and of the channels leading into it made it\r\nquite impossible to use them for this purpose, nobody ever proposed to\r\nsend those big ships through the canal. In later years Ballin often\r\nspoke with great bitterness of those journalists who would never leave\r\noff writing about \"the daring of our merchant fleet\" in terms of\r\nunmeasured eulogy, and whom he described as the greatest enemies of the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the propaganda work for the Imperial Navy to which\r\nthe Kaiser contributed by his own personal efforts: the range of his\r\nmaritime interests was much wider. He gave his assistance when the\r\nproblems connected with the troop transports to the Far East and to\r\nSouth West Africa were under discussion; he studied with keen attention\r\nthe progress of the German mercantile marine, the vessels of which he\r\nfrequently met on his travels; he often went on board the German tourist\r\nsteamers, those in Norwegian waters for instance, when he would\r\nunfailingly make some complimentary remarks on the management, and he\r\nbecame the lavish patron of the sporting events known as Kiel Week, the\r\nscope of which was extending from year to year. The Kiel Week,\r\noriginally started by the yachting clubs of Hamburg for the\r\nencouragement of their sport, gradually developed into a social event of\r\nthe first order, and since 1902 it became customary for the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie to dispatch one of their big steamers to Kiel,\r\nwhere it served as a hotel ship for a large number of the visitors. From\r\n1897 Kiel Week was preceded by a visit of the Kaiser--and frequently of\r\nthe Kaiserin as well--to Hamburg, where their Majesties attended the\r\nsummer races and the yachting regatta on the lower Elbe. In 1897 the\r\nKaiser had the intention of being present at a banquet which the\r\nNorddeutsche Regatta-Verein was giving on board the Packetfahrt liner\r\n_Columbia_, and he was only prevented from doing so at the last moment.\r\nIn the following year the Hamburg-Amerika Linie sent their s.s.\r\n_Pretoria_ to Kiel. On this vessel the well-known \"Regatta dinner\" took\r\nplace which the Kaiser attended, and which, on future occasions, he\r\ncontinued to honour with his presence. Ballin received a special\r\ninvitation to visit the Kaiser on board his yacht _Hohenzollern_. He\r\ncould not, however, avail himself of it, because the message only\r\nreached him on his way home to Hamburg. The year after, the Kaiser\r\ncommanded Ballin to sit next to him at the table, and engaged him in a\r\nlong conversation on the subject of the load-line which he wanted to see\r\nadopted by German shipping firms for their vessels. The Packetfahrt\r\ncarried this suggestion into practice shortly afterwards, and in course\r\nof time the other companies followed suit.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of these festivities the Kaiser in 1904 paid a visit to\r\nthe new premises of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie. In 1905 and in subsequent\r\nyears he also visited Ballin's private home and took lunch with him. The\r\nspeeches which he made at the regatta dinners given in connexion with\r\nthe regatta on the lower Elbe frequently contained some political\r\nreferences. In 1908, for instance, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Although we do not possess such a navy as we ought to have, we\r\n     have gained a place in the sun. It will now be my duty to see to it\r\n     that we shall keep this place in the sun against all comers.... I,\r\n     as the supreme head of the Empire, can only rejoice whenever I see\r\n     a Hanseatic citizen--let him be a native of Hamburg, or Bremen, or\r\n     Lübeck--striking out into the world with his eyes wide open, and\r\n     trying to find a spot where he can hammer a nail into the wall from\r\n     which to hang the tools needed to carry on his trade.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1912 he quoted the motto from the Lübeck Ratskeller:\r\n\r\n     \"It is easy to hoist the flag, but it costs a great deal to haul it\r\n     down with honour.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in 1914, after the launch of the big steamer _Bismarck_, he quoted\r\nBismarck's saying, slightly altered:\r\n\r\n\"We Germans fear God, but nothing and nobody besides.\"\r\n\r\nKiel Week never passed without a great deal of political discussion. The\r\nclose personal contact on such occasions between Ballin and the Kaiser\r\nfurnished the former with many an opportunity for expressing his views\r\non politics. Much has been said about William II's \"irresponsible\r\nadvisers,\" who are alleged to have endeavoured to influence him in the\r\ninterests of certain cliques, and it cannot, of course, be denied that\r\nthe men who formed the personal entourage of the monarch were very far\r\nfrom representing every shade of public opinion, even if that had been\r\npossible. The traditions of the Prussian Court and of princely education\r\nmay have contributed their share to this state of things. The result, at\r\nany rate, was that in times of crises--as, for instance, during the\r\nwar--it was impossible to break through the phalanx of men who guarded\r\nthe Kaiser and to withdraw him from their influence. Events have shown\r\nhow strong this influence must have been, and how little it was suited\r\nto induce the Kaiser to apply any self-criticism to his preconceived\r\nideas. Added to this, there was the difficulty of obtaining a private\r\nconversation with the Kaiser for any length of time--a difficulty which\r\nwas but rarely overcome even by persons possessing very high\r\ncredentials. It has already been mentioned that the Kaiser did not like\r\nto be contradicted in the presence of others, because he considered it\r\nderogatory to his sovereign position. Ballin repeatedly succeeded in\r\nengaging the Kaiser in private conversations of some length, especially\r\nafter his journeys abroad, when the Kaiser invited him to lunch with\r\nhim, and afterwards to accompany him on a walk unattended.\r\n\r\nBallin's notes more than once refer to such conversations with the\r\nKaiser, e.g. on June 3rd, 1901, when he had been a member of the\r\nImperial luncheon party:\r\n\r\n     \"After lunch the Kaiser asked me to report on my trip to the Far\r\n     East, and he, in his turn, told me some exceedingly interesting\r\n     pieces of news relating to his stay in England, and to political\r\n     affairs connected with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passage, referring to the Kiel Week, is taken from the\r\nnotes of the same year:\r\n\r\n     \"I received many marks of the Kaiser's attention, who, on July\r\n     27th, summoned me to Kiel once more, as he wished to discuss with\r\n     the Chancellor and me the question of the Japanese bank.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his trip to the Far East Ballin had taken a great deal of trouble\r\nto bring about the establishment of a German-Japanese bank.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are taken from the notes of subsequent years:\r\n\r\n     \"On December 10th (1903) I received a wire asking me to see the\r\n     Kaiser at the _Neues Palais_. To my infinite joy the Kaiser had\r\n     quite recovered the use of his voice. He looked well and fit, and\r\n     during a stroll through the park I had a long chat with him\r\n     concerning my trip to America and other matters. In February the\r\n     Kaiser intends to undertake a Mediterranean cruise on board the\r\n     _Hohenzollern_ for the benefit of his health. He will probably\r\n     proceed to Genoa on board one of the Imperial mail packets, which\r\n     is to be chartered for him.\"\r\n\r\n     (April 1904). \"The Kaiser had expressed a wish to see me in Italy.\r\n     On my arrival at Naples I found a telegram waiting for me in which\r\n     I was asked to proceed to Messina if necessary. Owing, however, to\r\n     the state of our negotiations with the Russian Government, I did\r\n     not think it desirable to meet the Kaiser just then, and thus I had\r\n     no opportunity of seeing him until May 3rd when I was in Berlin to\r\n     attend a meeting of the _Disconto-Gesellschaft_, and to confer with\r\n     Stübel on the question of some further troop transports to South\r\n     West Africa. I received an invitation to join the Imperial luncheon\r\n     party at which the birthday of the Crown Prince was to be\r\n     celebrated in advance, since his Majesty would not be in town on\r\n     May 6th. The Kaiser's health had much improved through his cruise;\r\n     he had lost some of his stoutness, and the Kaiserin, too, was\r\n     greatly pleased to see him looking so well. We naturally discussed\r\n     the topics of the day, and the Kaiser, as always, was full of\r\n     kindness and goodwill towards me.\"\r\n\r\n     \"On June 21st, 1904, the usual Imperial Regatta took place at\r\n     Cuxhaven, and the usual dinner on board the _Blücher_. These events\r\n     were followed by Kiel Week, which lasted from June 22nd to 28th. We\r\n     stayed on board the _Victoria Luise_, and I was thus brought into\r\n     especially close contact with the Kaiser. I accompanied him to\r\n     Eckernförde on board the _Meteor_, and we discussed the political\r\n     situation, particularly in its bearing on the Morocco question and\r\n     on the attitude of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\n     \"On June 19th, 1904, the Kaiser, the Kaiserin, and some of their\r\n     sons were staying in Hamburg. I dined with them at Tschirschky's\r\n     (the Prussian Minister in Hamburg), and we drove to the races. On\r\n     June 20th we proceeded to Cuxhaven, where, on board the\r\n     _Deutschland_, I heard the news--which the Kaiser had just\r\n     communicated to Kaempff (the captain of the _Deutschland_)--that\r\n     the North German Lloyd steamer _Kaiser Wilhelm II_, in consequence\r\n     of her being equipped with larger propellers, had won the speed\r\n     record. Late at night the Kaiser asked me to see him on board the\r\n     _Hohenzollern_, where he engaged me in a long discussion on the\r\n     most varied subjects. On June 21st the regatta took place at\r\n     Cuxhaven. The Kaiser and Prince Heinrich were amongst the guests\r\n     who were entertained at dinner on board the _Deutschland_. The\r\n     Kaiser was in the best of health and spirits. Owing to the\r\n     circumstance that Burgomaster Burchard--who generally engages the\r\n     Kaiser in after-dinner conversation--was prevented by his illness\r\n     from being present, I was enabled to introduce a number of Hamburg\r\n     gentlemen to His Majesty. As the Kaiser had summoned me to dine\r\n     with him on board the _Hohenzollern_ on the 22nd, I could not\r\n     return to Hamburg, but had to travel through the Kiel Canal that\r\n     same night on board a tug steamer. On the 22nd I stayed at the club\r\n     house of the Imperial Yachting Club, whilst at my own house a\r\n     dinner party was given for 36 persons. On the 23rd I changed my\r\n     quarters to the _Prinzessin Victoria Luise_, and the other visitors\r\n     arrived there about noon. A special feature of Kiel Week of 1904\r\n     was the visit of King Edward to the Kaiser whom he met at Kiel. For\r\n     the accommodation of the ministers of state and of the other\r\n     visitors whom the Kaiser had invited in connexion with the presence\r\n     of the King, we had placed our s.s. _Prinz Joachim_ at his\r\n     disposal, in addition to the _Prinzessin Victoria Luise_. We also\r\n     supplied, for the first time, a hotel ship, the _Graf Waldersee_,\r\n     all the cabins of which were engaged. On June 27th my wife and I,\r\n     and a number of other visitors from the _Prinzessin Victoria\r\n     Luise_, were invited to take afternoon tea with the Kaiser and\r\n     Kaiserin on board the _Hohenzollern_, and I had a lengthy\r\n     conversation with King Edward.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever the Kaiser granted Ballin an interview without the presence of\r\nwitnesses he cast aside all dignity, and discussed matters with him as\r\nfriend to friend. Neither did he object to his friend's counsel and\r\nadmonitions, and he was not offended if Ballin, on such occasions,\r\nsubjected his actions or his opinions to severe criticism.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions the Kaiser, as Ballin repeatedly pointed out, \"took it\r\nall in without interrupting, looking at me from the depth of his kind\r\nand honest eyes.\" That he did not bear Ballin any malice for his\r\nfrankness is shown by the fact that he took a lively and cordial\r\ninterest in all the events touching the private life of Ballin and his\r\nfamily, his daughter's engagement, for instance--an interest which still\r\ncontinued after Ballin's death.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this close friendship between Ballin and the Kaiser, it\r\nwould be quite wrong to assume that Ballin exercised anything resembling\r\na permanent influence on His Majesty. Their meetings took place only\r\nvery occasionally, and were often separated by intervals extending over\r\nseveral months, and it happened only in rare cases that Ballin availed\r\nhimself of the privilege of writing to the Kaiser in person. It is true\r\nthat the latter was always pleased to listen to Ballin's explanations of\r\nhis views, and it is possible that every now and than he did allow\r\nhimself to be guided by them; but it is quite certain that he never\r\nallowed these views to exercise any actual influence on the country's\r\npolitics. The events narrated in the chapter of this book dealing with\r\npolitics show that in a concrete case, at any rate, Ballin's\r\nrecommendations and the weight of his arguments were not sufficient to\r\ncope successfully with the influence of others who were the permanent\r\nadvisers of the sovereign, and who had at all times access to His\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nIf thus the effect of Ballin's friendship with the Kaiser has frequently\r\nbeen greatly overrated in regard to politics, the same holds good--and,\r\nindeed, to a still greater extent--in regard to the advantages which the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie is supposed to have derived from it. One of\r\nBallin's associates on the Board of the company was quite right when he\r\nsaid: \"Ballin's friendship with the Kaiser has done more harm than good\r\nto the Hamburg-Amerika Linie.\" Indirectly, of course, it raised the\r\nprestige of the company both at home and abroad. But there is no doubt\r\nthat it had also an adverse effect upon it: at any rate, outside of\r\nGermany. It gave rise to all sorts of rumours, e.g. that the company\r\nobtained great advantages from the Government; that the latter\r\nsubsidized it to a considerable extent; that the Kaiser was one of the\r\nprincipal shareholders, etc. It is also quite certain that these beliefs\r\nwere largely instrumental in making the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, as Ballin\r\nput it, one of the war aims of Great Britain, and it is even alleged\r\nthat, at the close of the war, the British Government approached some of\r\nthe country's leading shipping firms with the suggestion that they\r\nshould buy up the Hamburg-Amerika Linie or the North German Lloyd. This\r\nwas at the time when it became desirable to secure the necessary\r\norganization for the intended commercial conquest of the Continent. It\r\nis quite possible--and, I am inclined to think, quite probable--that\r\nthis suggestion was put forward because such a step would be in harmony\r\nwith that frame of mind from which originated such stipulations of the\r\nVersailles treaty as deal with shipping masters, and with the assumption\r\nthat German shipping--which was supposed to depend for its continuance\r\nmainly on the existence of the German monarchial system--would\r\npractically come to an end with the disappearance of the latter. It\r\nwould, indeed, be difficult to name any historical document which pays\r\nless regard to the vital necessities of a nation and which actually\r\nignores them more completely than does the treaty signed at Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe allegation that Ballin should ever have attempted to make use of his\r\nfriendship with the Kaiser for his own or for his company's benefit is,\r\nmoreover, diametrically opposed to the established fact that he knew the\r\nprecise limits of his influence, and that he never endeavoured to\r\noverreach himself. His \"policy of compromise\" was the practical outcome\r\nof this trait of his character.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which my close observation of Ballin's work during the last\r\nten years of his life enabled me to form was, as far as its political\r\nside is concerned, confirmed to me in every detail by no less a person\r\nthan Prince Bülow, who, without doubt, is the most competent judge of\r\nGerman affairs in the first decade of the twentieth century. When I\r\nasked the Prince whether Ballin could be accused of ever having abused\r\nthe friendship between himself and the Kaiser for any ulterior ends\r\nwhatever, he replied with a decided negative. Ballin, he said, had never\r\ndreamt of doing such a thing. He had always exercised the greatest tact\r\nin his relations with the Kaiser, and had never made use of them to gain\r\nany private advantage. Besides, his views had nearly always coincided\r\nwith those held by the responsible leaders of the country's political\r\ndestinies. Once only a conflict of opinion had arisen between Ballin and\r\nhimself on a political question, and this was at the time when the\r\ncustoms tariffs were under discussion. Ballin held that these were\r\ndetrimental to the country's best interests, and it is a well-known fact\r\nthat, at that time, there was a widespread feeling as to the\r\nimpossibility of concluding any commercial treaties so long as those\r\ntariffs were in operation.\r\n\r\nDuring the most critical period of the existence of the monarchy--i.e.\r\nduring the war--Ballin's influence on the Kaiser was but slight. Only on\r\na very few occasions was he able to meet the Kaiser, and he never had an\r\nopportunity of talking to him privately, as in former times. It was the\r\nconstant aim of the Kaiser's entourage to maintain their controlling\r\ninfluence over the Kaiser unimpaired. Even when they last met--in\r\nSeptember, 1918--and when Ballin, at the instance of the Supreme Army\r\nCommand, was asked to explain to the Kaiser the situation as it actually\r\nwas, he was not permitted to see the Kaiser without the presence of a\r\nwitness, so that his influence could not assert itself. The fact that\r\nthe Kaiser was debarred from knowing the truth was the cause of his and\r\nof his country's ruin. \"The Kaiser is only allowed to know the bright\r\nside of things,\" Ballin used to say, \"and therefore he does not see\r\nmatters as they really stand.\"\r\n\r\nThis is all the more regrettable because, as Ballin thought, the Kaiser\r\nwas not wanting in either the capacity or the independence of mind which\r\nwould have enabled him to pursue a policy better than the one in which\r\nhe actually acquiesced. More than once, Ballin said, the Kaiser's\r\njudgment on a political issue was absolutely sound, but he did not wish\r\nto act contrary to the recommendations of his responsible advisers.\r\nWhen, for instance, it was decided that the gunboat _Panther_ should be\r\ndispatched to Agadir, a decision which was arrived at during Kiel Week\r\nof 1911, the Kaiser exclaimed, with much show of feeling, that a step of\r\nsuch far-reaching importance could not be taken on the spur of the\r\nmoment and without consulting the nation, and he only gave his consent\r\nwith great reluctance. Moreover, Ballin stated, he was by no means in\r\nsympathy with Tirpitz, and the latter was not a man after his own heart,\r\nbut he was content to let him have his way, because he believed that the\r\nnaval policy of Tirpitz was right, so that he was not entitled to\r\njeopardize the interests of his country by dismissing him. The Kaiser\r\nwas not moved by an ambitious desire to build up a powerful navy\r\ndestined to risk all in a decisive struggle against Great Britain, and\r\nthe numerous passages in his public speeches which foreign observers\r\ninterpreted as implying such a desire, must be regarded as the explosive\r\noutbursts of a strong character which was sometimes directed into wrong\r\nchannels by a certain sense of its own superiority, and which, in\r\nseeking to express itself, would occasionally outrun discretion. His\r\ninconsistency which made him an easy prey to the influence of his\r\nentourage, caused him to be looked upon by foreign critics as\r\nvacillating and unstable, and this impression--as was discovered when\r\ntoo late--discredited his country immensely in the eyes of Great\r\nBritain, who, after all, had to be reckoned with as the decisive factor\r\nin all questions relative to world policy. Such a character could be\r\nguided in the right direction only if the right influence could be\r\nbrought permanently to bear on it. But who was to exercise such\r\ninfluence on the Kaiser? Certainly his entourage did not include anyone\r\nqualified to do so, because it was not representative of all sections of\r\nthe nation; neither was any of the successive Chancellors able to\r\nundertake such a task, since none of them succeeded in solving the\r\nquestions of internal policy in a manner approved by a reliable and\r\nsolid majority in the Reichstag. The Kaiserin also was not free from\r\nprejudice as to the war and the causes of its outbreak. Ballin relates\r\nhow, on one of the few occasions when he was privileged to see the\r\nKaiser during the war, Her Majesty, with clenched fists, exclaimed:\r\n\"Peace with England? Never!\" The Imperial family considered themselves\r\nbetrayed by England and the English court. Why this should be so is\r\nperhaps still more difficult to say now than Ballin could understand in\r\nthose days. Arguments, however, were useless in such a case, and could\r\nproduce nothing but harm. The Kaiser did not bear Ballin any malice\r\nbecause of the frankness with which he explained his views that day; on\r\nthe contrary, members of the Kaiser's entourage have confirmed that,\r\nafter Ballin had left that evening, he even tried to make the Kaiserin\r\nsee his (Ballin's) point of view. Putting himself into Ballin's\r\nposition, he said, he could perfectly understand how he felt about it\r\nall; but he himself could not help thinking that his English relatives\r\nhad played him false, so that he was forced to continue the struggle\r\nwith England tooth and nail.\r\n\r\nWhen Ballin, during the summer of 1918, gave me a character sketch of\r\nthe Kaiser, of which the account I have endeavoured to present in the\r\npreceding paragraphs is an outline, he added: \"But what is the good of\r\nit? He is, after all, the managing director, and if things turn out\r\nwrong he is held responsible exactly as if he were the director of a\r\njoint-stock company.\"\r\n\r\nThis comparison of the German Empire and its ruler with a joint-stock\r\ncompany and its board of directors used to form a frequent subject of\r\nargument in our inner circle, and even before the war these discussions\r\nregularly led to the conclusion that, what with the policy carried on by\r\nthe Government and that carried on by the parties in the Reichstag, the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Linie would have gone bankrupt long ago if its affairs\r\nhad been conducted on such lines as those of the German Empire. It was a\r\nnever-ending cause of surprise to us to learn how completely the\r\nEuropean situation was misjudged in the highest quarters, when, for\r\ninstance, the following incident, which was reported to Ballin during\r\nthe war, became known to us. One day, when the conversation at lunch in\r\nthe Imperial headquarters turned to the subject of England, the Kaiser\r\nremarked: \"I only wish someone had told me beforehand that England would\r\ntake up arms against us,\" to which one of those present replied in a\r\nquiet whisper: \"Metternich.\" It would have been just as proper, Ballin\r\nadded, to have mentioned my own name, because I also warned the Kaiser\r\nover and over again. On another page in this book reference is made to\r\nthe well-known fact that the reason why Count Metternich, the German\r\nambassador at the Court of St. James, had to relinquish his post was\r\nthat he, in one of his reports, predicted that Germany would be involved\r\nin war with Great Britain no later than 1915 unless she reduced the pace\r\nof her naval armaments. This was one of those numerous predictions to\r\nwhich, like so many others, especially during the war, no one wanted to\r\nlisten. Even in the late summer of 1918, when Ballin saw the Kaiser for\r\nthe last time, such warnings met with a deaf ear. This meeting, to which\r\nBallin consented with reluctance, was the outcome of a friendship which,\r\npolitically speaking, was devoid of practical results. A detailed\r\naccount follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month of July, 1914, Ballin, when staying at\r\nKissingen for the benefit of his health, received a letter from the\r\nForeign Secretary, Herr v. Jagow, which made him put an immediate end to\r\nhis holiday and proceed to Berlin. The letter was dated July 15th, and\r\nits principal contents were as follows:\r\n\r\nThe _Berliner Tageblatt_, it said, had published some information\r\nconcerning certain Anglo-Russian agreements on naval questions. The\r\nForeign Office did not attach much value to it, because it was at\r\nvariance with the general assumption that Germany's relations with Great\r\nBritain had undergone a change for the better, and also with the\r\napparent reluctance of British statesmen to tie their country to any\r\nsuch agreements. The matter, however, had been followed up all the same,\r\nand through very confidential channels it had been ascertained that the\r\nrumours in question were by no means devoid of an actual background of\r\nfact. Grey, too, had not denied them point blank at his interview with\r\nLichnowsky. It was quite true that Anglo-Russian negotiations were\r\nproceeding on the subject of a naval agreement, and that the Russian\r\nGovernment was anxious to secure as much mutual co-operation between the\r\ntwo countries as possible. A definite understanding had not, so far,\r\nbeen reached, notwithstanding the pressure exercised by Russia. Grey's\r\nattitude had become somewhat uncertain; but it was thought that he\r\nwould ultimately give his consent, and that he would quieten his own\r\nconscience by arguing that the negotiations had not really been\r\nconducted between the Cabinets, but between the respective naval\r\nauthorities. It was also quite likely that the British, who were adepts\r\nat the art of making nice distinctions, would be negotiating with the\r\nmental reservation that they would refrain from taking an active part\r\nwhen the critical moment arrived, if it suited them not to do so; and a\r\n_casus foederis_ would presumably not be provided for in the\r\nagreement. At any rate, the effect of the latter would be enormously to\r\nstrengthen the aggressive tendencies of Russia. If the agreement became\r\nperfect, it would be useless for Germany to think any longer of coming\r\nto a _rapprochement_ with Great Britain, and therefore it would be a\r\nmatter of great importance to make a last effort towards counteracting\r\nthe Russian designs. His (v. Jagow's) idea was that Ballin, who had\r\nintimate relations with numerous Englishmen in leading positions, should\r\nsend a note of warning across the North Sea. This suggestion was\r\nfollowed up by several hints as to the most suitable form of wording\r\nsuch a note, and the letter concluded with the statement that the matter\r\nwas one of great urgency. A postscript dated July 16th added that a\r\nfurther article had been published by the _Berliner Tageblatt_,\r\naccording to which the informants of the author also took a serious view\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nBallin, in response to the request contained in the letter, did not\r\ncontent himself with sending a written note to his London friends, but\r\nhe immediately went to Berlin for the purpose of gaining additional\r\ninformation on the spot, with special reference to the general political\r\noutlook. He learned that Austria intended to present a strongly worded\r\nnote to Serbia, and that it was expected that in reply a counter-note\r\ndictated by Russia would be received. He was also told that the\r\nGovernment not only wanted some information regarding the matter which\r\nformed the special subject of Herr v. Jagow's letter, but also regarding\r\nthe general political situation in London, as it was doubted whether the\r\nreports received from the ambassador were sufficiently trustworthy and\r\ncomplete. This was all that Ballin was told. Since then many facts have\r\nbecome known which throw a light on the way in which political questions\r\nwere dealt with by the Berlin authorities during the critical period\r\npreceding the war, and if we, knowing what we know now, read the letter\r\nof Herr v. Jagow, we ask ourselves in amazement what was the object of\r\nthe proposed action in London? Could it be that it was intended to\r\nintimidate the British Government? This could hardly be thought\r\npossible, so that some other result must have been aimed at. We can only\r\nsay that the whole affair is still surrounded by much mystery, and we\r\ncan sympathize with Ballin's bitter complaints in later days that he\r\nthought people had not treated him with as much openness as they should\r\nhave done, and that they had abused his intimate relations with leading\r\nBritish personages.\r\n\r\nBallin then left Berlin for Hamburg. He gave me his impressions of the\r\nstate of political affairs--which he did not regard as critical--and\r\nwent to London, ostensibly on business. In London he met Grey, Haldane,\r\nand Churchill, and there also he did not look upon the situation as\r\ncritical--at least, not at first. When, however, the text of the\r\nAustrian note became known on Thursday, July 23rd, and when its full\r\nsignificance had gradually been realized, the political atmosphere\r\nbecame clouded: people asked what was Austria's real object, and began\r\nto fear lest the peace might be disturbed. Nevertheless, Ballin returned\r\nfrom London on July 27th with the impression that a fairly capable\r\nGerman diplomat might even then succeed in bringing about an\r\nunderstanding with Great Britain and France which, by preventing Russia\r\nfrom striking, would result in preserving the peace. Great Britain and\r\nthe leading British politicians, he said, were absolutely in favour of\r\npeace, and the French Government was so much against war that its\r\nrepresentatives in London seemed to him to be rather nervous on the\r\nsubject. They would, he thought, do anything in their power to prevent\r\nwar. If, however, France was attacked without any provocation on her\r\npart, Great Britain would be compelled to come to her assistance.\r\nBritain would never allow that we, as was provided for in the old plan\r\nof campaign, should march through Belgium. It was quite true that the\r\nAustrian note had caused grave anxiety in London, but how earnestly the\r\nCabinet was trying to preserve peace might be gauged by the fact that\r\nChurchill, when he took leave of Ballin, implored him, almost with tears\r\nin his eyes, not to go to war. These impressions of Ballin are confirmed\r\nby the reports of Prince Lichnowsky and other members of the German\r\nEmbassy in their observations during the critical days.\r\n\r\nApart from these politicians and diplomatists on active service there\r\nwere other persons of political training, though no longer in office,\r\nwho did not think at that time that there was an immediate danger of\r\nwar. In this connexion I should like to add a report of a very\r\nremarkable conversation with Count Witte, which took place at Bad\r\nSalzschlirf on July 24th. The Count--whose untimely death was greatly\r\nregretted--was without any doubt one of the most capable statesmen of\r\nhis time--perhaps the only one with a touch of genius Europe\r\npossessed--and he certainly knew more about the complicated state of\r\nthings in Russia than any living person. For these reasons his views on\r\nthe events which form the first stage of the fateful conflict are of\r\nspecial interest. I shall reproduce the report of this conversation\r\nexactly as we received it at the time, and as we passed it on to Berlin.\r\nThe authenticity of the statements of Count Witte as given here is\r\nbeyond question.\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday (on July 24th) I paid a visit to Count Witte who was\r\n     staying at Bad Salzschlirf, and in the course of the day I had\r\n     several conversations with him, the first of which took place as\r\n     early as ten o'clock in the morning. After a few words of welcome,\r\n     and after discussing some matters of general and personal interest,\r\n     I said to the Count: 'I should like to thank you for your welcome\r\n     letter and for your telegram. The question which you raise in them\r\n     of a meeting between our two emperors appears of such fundamental\r\n     importance to me that I may perhaps hope to be favoured with some\r\n     details by you personally.'\r\n\r\n     \"Witte replied: 'In the first instance I wish to reaffirm what I\r\n     have repeatedly told you, both verbally and by letter, viz. that I\r\n     am not in the least anxious to be nominated Russian delegate for\r\n     the proposed negotiations concerning a commercial treaty between\r\n     Germany and Russia. Whoever may be appointed from the Russian side\r\n     will gain no laurels. I think a meeting between the Kaiser and the\r\n     Tsar some time within the next few weeks would be of very great\r\n     importance. Have you read the French papers? The tone now assumed\r\n     by Jules Hedeman is a direct challenge. I know Hedeman, and I also\r\n     know that he only writes what will please Sasonov, Poincaré and\r\n     Paléologue (the French ambassador in Petrograd). Now that the\r\n     Peterhof meeting has taken place the language employed by all the\r\n     French and Russian papers will become more arrogant than ever. It\r\n     is quite certain that the Russian diplomatists and their French\r\n     colleagues will now assume a different tone in their intercourse\r\n     with the German diplomatists. The _rapprochement_ with Great\r\n     Britain is making considerable progress, and whether a naval\r\n     convention exists or not, Great Britain will now side with Russia\r\n     and France. If even now a meeting could be arranged between the two\r\n     Emperors, this would be of immense significance. The\r\n     mischief-makers both in Russia and in France would be made to look\r\n     small, and public opinion would calm down again.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I asked Witte: 'Do you think, Sergei Yulyevitch, that the Tsar\r\n     would avail himself of a possible opportunity of meeting the\r\n     Kaiser?'\r\n\r\n     \"Witte replied: 'I am firmly convinced of it; I may, indeed, state\r\n     without hesitation that the Tsar would be delighted to do so. The\r\n     personal relations between the Tsar and the Kaiser are not of an\r\n     ordinary kind. They converse with each other in terms of intimate\r\n     friendship, and each time the Tsar has had a chat with the Kaiser\r\n     he has been in better spirits. Believe me, if this meeting comes\r\n     off, the impression which the French visit has left on the Tsar\r\n     will be entirely wiped out. The effect of the showy reception of\r\n     the French visitors which the press agitators have not failed to\r\n     use for their own ends will be obliterated. Such a meeting will\r\n     express in unambiguous terms that, whatever value the Tsar attaches\r\n     to the Franco-Russian alliance, he insists on the maintenance of\r\n     amicable relations with Germany. The meeting will have to be\r\n     arranged without loss of time, in about four or six weeks, because\r\n     in two months from now the Tsar will be leaving for Livadia. The\r\n     army manoeuvres will be held within the next few weeks, and the\r\n     Tsar will then go to the Finnish skerries where, in my opinion, the\r\n     meeting might take place without difficulty.'\r\n\r\n     \"I asked Witte: 'Do you not think that, if the meeting were\r\n     officially proposed by Germany, it might be looked upon as a sign\r\n     of weakness on her side, especially in view of the now existing\r\n     tension between the two countries?'\r\n\r\n     \"Witte replied: 'By no means. One has always to take into account\r\n     the fact that the relations between the Tsar and the Kaiser, as I\r\n     explained before, are in the highest degree friendly and intimate.\r\n     I do not know how the Kaiser would feel on the subject, but I am\r\n     convinced that he is possessed of the necessary political sagacity\r\n     to find the way that will lead to a meeting. He might, e.g., write\r\n     to the Tsar quite openly that, as the relations between their two\r\n     countries had lately been somewhat under a cloud in consequence of\r\n     the inefficient diplomacy of their respective representatives, he\r\n     would be particularly happy to meet him at this juncture. Or the\r\n     suggestion might reach the Tsar _via_ the Grand Duke of Hesse and\r\n     his sister, the Tsarina. But this is immaterial, because the Kaiser\r\n     is sure to find the right way. I can only repeat that the effect of\r\n     the meeting would be enormous. The Russian press and Russian\r\n     society would change their whole attitude, and the agitation in the\r\n     French press would receive a severe setback.'\r\n\r\n     \"I said to Witte: 'I shall communicate the gist of our conversation\r\n     to Mr. Ballin. As it is quite possible that he will be ready to\r\n     endorse this suggestion, I should like to know your answer to one\r\n     more question, viz., whether, if Mr. Ballin were to submit the\r\n     proposal to the proper quarters, you would allow him to refer to\r\n     you as the originator of the suggestion.'\r\n\r\n     \"Witte replied: 'Certainly. He may say that I look upon this\r\n     meeting as an event of the utmost importance to both countries at\r\n     the present moment.'\r\n\r\n     \"I said: 'Seeing that you will be leaving Germany within five days\r\n     from now, would you be prepared to go to Berlin if the Kaiser would\r\n     receive you unofficially?'\r\n\r\n     \"Witte replied: 'Certainly. At any moment.'\r\n\r\n     \"When we went for a walk in the afternoon, Witte made reference,\r\n     amongst other things, to various political questions. I shall\r\n     confine myself to quoting only a few of his remarks.\r\n\r\n     \"'Practically speaking,' he said, 'I think that there will be no\r\n     war, although theoretically the air is thick with difficulties\r\n     which only a war can clear away. But nowadays there is nobody who,\r\n     like William the First, would put his foot down and say: \"Now I\r\n     will not yield another inch!\" The spot at Ems where this happened\r\n     is now adorned with a monument. Within a few years when the\r\n     armaments which for the present are on paper only, shall be\r\n     completed, Russia will really be strong. But even then, one has\r\n     still to reckon with the possibility of internal complications.\r\n     France, however, need not fear any such difficulties, because\r\n     countries possessing a constitution acknowledged by all their\r\n     inhabitants are not liable to revolutionary movements, no matter\r\n     how often their governments change.'\r\n\r\n     \"In speaking of Hartwig, Witte remarked: 'His death is the severest\r\n     blow to Russian diplomacy. He was unquestionably the most gifted\r\n     Russian diplomatist. When Count Lammsdorff, who was a great friend\r\n     of mine, was Minister for Foreign Affairs, he used to do nothing\r\n     without first asking my advice. Hartwig, at that time, was the\r\n     chief of his departmental staff, and he often came to see me. Even\r\n     in those early days I had an opportunity of admiring his eminent\r\n     diplomatic gifts.'\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion which formed the principal subject of the above\r\nconversations--viz. that a personal meeting of the two Emperors should\r\nbe arranged in order to remove the existing tension--was not followed\r\nup, and the proposal would in any case have been doomed to failure,\r\nbecause the politicians who were responsible for the conduct of affairs\r\nat that time had done nothing to prevent the Kaiser from embarking on\r\nhis customary cruise in Northern waters.\r\n\r\nThe latter end of July was full of excitement for the directors and the\r\nstaff of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie. We endeavoured to acquaint the\r\nvessels that were under way with the critical situation, and we\r\ninstructed each captain to make for a neutral port in case war should\r\nbreak out. The naval authorities warned us not to allow any ships to put\r\nto sea, and we were particularly asked not to permit the sailing of the\r\ns.s. _Imperator_, which was fixed for July 31st, because the attitude of\r\nGreat Britain was uncertain. At a midnight meeting held at Ballin's\r\nprivate residence it was decided to postpone the departure of the vessel\r\n\"on account of the uncertain political situation.\" Every berth on the\r\nsteamer was booked, and hundreds of passengers were put to the greatest\r\ninconvenience. Most of them proceeded to a neutral or to a British port\r\nfrom which they subsequently embarked for the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter this, events followed upon each other's heels in swift succession.\r\nWhen war broke out, most of the ships succeeded in reaching neutral\r\nports, so that comparatively few of them were lost in the early part of\r\nthe war. By August 5th the cables had been cut. This circumstance made\r\nit very difficult to keep up communications with New York, and compelled\r\nthe majority of our agencies and branches abroad to use their own\r\ndiscretion as to what to do. The place of regular business was taken by\r\nthe work involved in carrying out the various agreements which the\r\ncompany had entered into during peace time, viz. those for the\r\nvictualling and bunkering of various units of the Imperial Navy, for the\r\nsupply of auxiliary vessels, and for the establishment of an\r\norganization which was to purchase the provisions needed by the navy.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior had started to devise\r\nmeasures for provisioning the country as a whole, as far as that was\r\nstill possible. It is well known that the responsible authorities had\r\ndone far too little--indeed, hardly anything at all--to cope with this\r\nproblem, because they had never taken a very serious view of the danger\r\nof war. Even the arrangements of the military authorities in connexion\r\nwith the plans of mobilization were utterly deficient in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe first who seriously studied the question as to what would have to be\r\ndone for the provisioning of the military and civil population if\r\nGermany had to fight against a coalition of enemies, and if the overseas\r\nsupplies were stopped, was General Count Georg Waldersee, who became\r\nQuartermaster General in 1912. In a letter which he wrote to Ballin\r\nabout that time, he gave a very clear description of the probable state\r\nof things in such an emergency. He pointed out that the amount of\r\nfoodstuffs required during a war would probably be larger than the\r\nquantities needed in peace time--a contingency which had escaped\r\nattention in Germany altogether--and that above all there would be an\r\nenormous shortage of raw materials. Therefore, he said, if it was\r\ndesired to guard the country against disagreeable surprises, it was\r\nimperative to make certain preparations for an economic and a financial\r\nmobilization. The military authorities at least had studied this problem\r\ntheoretically, but the civil authorities would not make any move at all.\r\nThe general said he thought it desirable that this question should\r\nreceive more attention in the future, and he asked Ballin to let him\r\nknow his views on the matter, and to give him some practical advice. The\r\nanxiety felt in military quarters was largely augmented by the receipt\r\nof disquieting rumours about the increase of Russian armaments.\r\n\r\nIn reply we furnished Count Waldersee with a brief memorandum written by\r\nmyself in which, amongst other items, I referred him to some suggestions\r\nput forward by Senator Possehl, of Lübeck, in the course of a lecture\r\ndelivered about the same time before a selected audience. In view of the\r\nfact that Germany depended for her food supply and for her raw materials\r\nto an increasing extent on foreign sources, there could be no doubt as\r\nto the necessity for making economic preparations against the\r\npossibility of a war, if a war was considered at all probable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and in spite of the newly awakened interest on the part of\r\nthe military authorities, these economic preparations had, before the\r\nwar, made absolutely no progress worth mentioning. The only practical\r\nstep which, as far as my knowledge goes, had been taken by the civil\r\nauthorities, was the conclusion of an agreement entered into with a\r\nDutch firm dealing with the importation of cereals in case of war. When,\r\nin the fateful summer of 1914, this contingency arose, the firm in\r\nquestion had chartered some British steamers, which instead of carrying\r\ntheir cargoes to Rotterdam took them to British ports.\r\n\r\nThus, no serious efforts of any kind had been made to grapple with the\r\nproblem. On Sunday, August 2nd, Geheimrat Frisch, who afterwards became\r\nthe director of the _Zentral-Einkaufs-Gesellschaft_ (Central Purchasing\r\nCorporation), came to Hamburg, in order to inform Ballin, at the request\r\nof the Ministry for the Interior, that the latter felt very anxious in\r\nregard to the quantity of food actually to be found in Germany, which,\r\nit was feared, would be very small, and that it was expected that a\r\ngreat shortage would arise after a very brief period. He therefore asked\r\nhim to use his best endeavours in order to secure supplies from abroad.\r\nA Hamburg firm was immediately requested to find out how much food was\r\nactually available in the country, and, although the figures obtained\r\nwere not quite so bad as it was expected, steps were taken at once to\r\nremedy the deficiencies by importing food from neutral countries. A\r\ngreat obstacle to the rapid success of these efforts was the absolute\r\nwant of any preparatory work. The very attempt to raise the necessary\r\nfunds abounded with difficulties of every kind, because no money had\r\nbeen set aside for such expenditure in connexion with the scheme of\r\nmobilization, and the time taken by the attempts made in this direction,\r\nas well as the circumstance that communication with the United States\r\ncould only be maintained _via_ neutral countries, were the causes of a\r\ngreat deal of serious delay.\r\n\r\nAt Ballin's suggestion the _Reichseinkauf_ (Government Purchasing\r\nOrganization) was then formed. For this organization the Hamburg-Amerika\r\nLinie was to do all the purchasing, and it was arranged that it should\r\nput at the disposal of the new body all those members of its staff who\r\nwere not called up, and who were considered suitable for the work.\r\nBuyers were sent to every neutral country; but the mobilization then in\r\nprogress led to a complete stoppage of railway travelling for the civil\r\npopulation, thus causing no end of difficulties to these buyers, and\r\nmaking personal contact with the Berlin authorities almost impossible.\r\nAdded to all this, there was the inevitable confusion which the\r\nreplacement of the civil administration by the army commands brought in\r\nits train. It had, in fact, been assumed that this war would resemble\r\nits predecessors in every respect, and no one was prepared for a world\r\nwar. Hence, such important matters as the importation of foodstuffs from\r\nabroad and the work of supplying political information to neutral\r\ncountries concerning the German standpoint were sadly neglected;\r\neverything had to be provided at a moment's notice, and had to be\r\ncarried through in the face of a great deal of opposition. Funds and\r\nenergy were largely wasted; the military, naval, and civil organizations\r\nwere working against one another instead of co-operating; and it took a\r\nlong time before a little order could be introduced into the chaos. It\r\nwas also found that the German credits abroad were quite inadequate for\r\nsuch enormous requirements. An attempt to dispose of some treasury bills\r\nin New York was only moderately successful, and in consequence of this\r\nlack of available funds the supplies obtained from the United States\r\nwere but small. Even the fact that the Hamburg-Amerika Linie immediately\r\nsucceeded in establishing the necessary connexions with American\r\nshippers, and in securing a sufficient amount of neutral tonnage, did\r\nnot improve matters in the least. To obtain the required funds in\r\nBerlin, as has been explained before, involved considerable loss of\r\ntime; and as the months passed the British blockade became more and more\r\neffective. Thus, as the war continued, large quantities of food could\r\nonly be procured from European countries.\r\n\r\nBallin took a large personal share in the actual business transacted by\r\nthe _Reichseinkauf_. He did so, if for no other reason, because he\r\nneeded some substitute for the work connected with the real shipping\r\nbusiness which was rapidly decreasing in extent. The only benefit his\r\ncompany derived from its new work was that it gave employment to part of\r\nthe members of its staff, thus reducing in some measure the expenses.\r\nWith the stoppage of the company's real business its principal source of\r\nincome ran dry in no time, and the small profits made out of the supply\r\nof provisions to the navy was only a poor compensation.\r\n\r\nThe world's economic activities in those days presented a picture of\r\nutter confusion. All the stock exchanges were closed; all dealings in\r\nstocks and shares had ceased, so that no prices could be quoted; several\r\ncountries had introduced a moratorium, and numerous banks had stopped\r\npayment. Germany had no longer any direct intercourse with the overseas\r\ncountries; the British censorship was daily increasing its hold on the\r\ntraffic proceeding _via_ neutral ports. At first those foreign steamship\r\ncompanies which maintained passenger services to America did splendid\r\nbusiness, because Europe was full of American tourists and business men\r\nwho were anxious to secure a berth to get home, and numerous cabin\r\npassengers had to be content with steerage accommodation. When this rush\r\nwas past, however, shipping business, like international commerce,\r\nentered upon its period of decline. The freight rates came down, the\r\nnumber of steamers laid up assumed large proportions, and the world's\r\ntraffic, in fact, was paralysed.\r\n\r\nAfter a comparatively brief period it was found too difficult to conduct\r\nthe _Reichseinkauf_ organization with its headquarters at Hamburg,\r\nbecause the intercourse with the Imperial Treasury at Berlin, which\r\nprovided the funds, took up too much time, and also because it seemed\r\nhighly advisable to purchase the foreign foodstuffs needed by the\r\nmilitary as well as the civil population through one and the same\r\norganization. The state of things in respect to these matters was\r\nsimply indescribable; indeed, if it had been purposely intended to\r\nencourage the growth of war profiteering, it would have been impossible\r\nto find a better method of setting about it. Numerous buyers,\r\nresponsible to different centres, not merely purchased without regard to\r\neach other, but even outbid each other, thus causing a rise in prices\r\nwhich the public had to pay. Conditions such as these were brought about\r\nby the utter unpreparedness of the competent civil authorities and by\r\nthe fact that the military authorities could dispose of the vast amounts\r\nof money placed at their command at the outbreak of the war. These\r\nconditions were doubtless the soil from which sprang all the evils which\r\nlater on developed into the pernicious system we connect with the name\r\nof _Kriegswirtschaft_, and for which it will be impossible to demand\r\nreparation owing to the lost war and to the outbreak of the revolution.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the intercourse with the proper Government\r\nboards, and to centralize the purchasing business as much as possible,\r\nBallin's suggestion that the seat of the organization should be removed\r\nto Berlin was adopted, and at the same time the whole matter was put on\r\na sounder footing by its conversion into a limited company under the\r\nname of _Zentral-Einkaufs-Gesellschaft_ (Central Purchasing\r\nCorporation). The history of the Z.E.G. is well known in the country,\r\nand its work has been subject to a great deal of criticism, largely due\r\nto the fact that all the annoyance caused by the many restrictions which\r\nthe Government found it necessary to impose, and which had to be put up\r\nwith during the war, was directed against this body. Generally speaking,\r\nthis attitude of the population was very unfair, because the principal\r\ngrievances concerned the distribution of the foodstuffs, and for this\r\npart the Z.E.G. was not responsible. Its only task was to obtain the\r\nnecessary supplies from abroad. If it is remembered that the\r\ntransactions of the corporation reached enormous proportions, and that,\r\nafter all, it was improvised at a time of war, we cannot be surprised to\r\nsee that some mistakes and even some serious blunders did occur\r\noccasionally, and that the right people were not always found in the\r\nright places. Moreover, some of the really amazing feats accomplished by\r\nthe Z.E.G--e.g. the supply of grain from Roumania, which necessitated\r\nenormous labour in connexion with the transhipment from rail to steamer\r\nand with the conveyance up the Danube--were only known to a few people.\r\nIt is obvious that nothing could be published during the war about these\r\nachievements nor about the agreements concluded, after endless\r\nnegotiations, with neutral countries and thus the management of the\r\nZ.E.G. was obliged to suffer in silence the criticisms and reproaches\r\nhurled at it without being able to defend itself.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the work done by the Z.E.G. may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat the goods handled by the organization during the four years from\r\n1915 to 1918 represented a value of 6,500 million marks, in which\r\nconnexion it must not be forgotten that at that time the purchasing\r\npower of the mark was still nearly the same as before the war. When the\r\nRoumanian harvest was brought in the daily imports sometimes reached a\r\ntotal of 800 truck-loads. However, the greatest credit, in my opinion,\r\nis due to the Z.E.G. for putting a stop to the above-mentioned confusion\r\nin the methods of buying abroad and for establishing normal conditions.\r\nTo-day it is scarcely possible to realize how difficult it was and how\r\nmuch time it required to overcome the opposition often met with at home.\r\n\r\nNot much need be said here about the activities of the Hamburg-Amerika\r\nLinie during the war. The longer the struggle lasted, and the larger the\r\nnumber of countries involved in the war against Germany became, the\r\nheavier became the company's losses of tonnage and of other property.\r\nAll the shore establishments, branch offices, pier accommodation, etc.,\r\nsituated in enemy countries, were confiscated, and the anxiety about the\r\npost-war reconstruction grew from month to month. Ballin never lost\r\nsight of this problem, and it is chiefly due to his efforts that the\r\nGovernment and the Reichstag passed a Bill (1917) providing the means\r\nfor the rebuilding of the country's mercantile marine. Along with this\r\nhe tried to keep the company financially independent by cutting down\r\nexpenses, by finding work for the inland offices of the company, by\r\nselling tonnage, and by other means. The families and dependents of\r\nthose employees who had been called to the colours were assisted as far\r\nas the funds at the company's disposal permitted. Of all these measures\r\nthe company has already given the necessary information to the public,\r\nand I can confine myself to these brief statements. There is only one\r\ncircumstance which requires special mention.\r\n\r\nIt is universally acknowledged that no German industry has suffered so\r\ngreatly through the action of the German Government as the shipping\r\nbusiness. When the discussions as to the rebuilding of the merchant\r\nfleet were being carried on, the Government frankly admitted this fact.\r\nI am not thinking, in this connexion, of those measures which were\r\nimposed upon the Government by the Versailles Treaty, such as the\r\nsurrender of the German mercantile marine, but what I have in mind is\r\nthe steps taken whilst the war was in actual progress. These have one\r\nthing in common with those imposed by the enemy: their originators have,\r\nmore or less, arrived at the belated conviction that they have\r\nsacrificed much valuable property to no purpose. In Great Britain it is\r\nadmitted quite openly that the confiscation of the German merchant\r\nfleet has very largely contributed to the ensuing collapse of the\r\nworld's shipping markets, and to the confusion which now prevails on\r\nevery trade route. The war measures of the German Government--or,\r\nrather, of the German naval authorities--have sacrificed enormous values\r\nmerely for the sake of a phantom, thus necessitating the compensation\r\ndue to the shipowners--a compensation far from sufficient to make good\r\neven a moderate fraction of the loss. The vessels that can be built for\r\nthe sums thrown out for this purpose will not be worth the twentieth\r\npart of the old ones, if quality is taken into account as well as\r\nquantity. This will become apparent when the compensation money has been\r\nspent, and when it will be possible to compare the fleet of German\r\npassenger boats then existing with what the country possessed previous\r\nto the war.\r\n\r\nThe phantom just referred to was the foolish belief that it would be\r\npossible to eliminate all ocean tonnage from the high seas--a belief\r\nwhich was in itself used to justify the submarine war, and which was\r\nresponsible for the assumption that the withdrawal of German tonnage\r\nfrom the high seas would affect the food and raw material supply of the\r\nenemy countries. This mistaken idea was also the reason for prohibiting\r\nthe sale of the German vessels in neutral ports, and for ordering the\r\ndestruction of their engines when it became impossible to prevent their\r\nconfiscation. The latter measure, and in particular the manner in which\r\nit was carried out, prove the utter inability of the competent\r\nauthorities to grasp the very elements of the great problem they were\r\ntackling, and in view of such lack of knowledge it is easy to understand\r\nthe bitterness of tone which characterizes Ballin's criticism of these\r\nmeasures as contained in his memorandum to the Minister of the Interior\r\n(1917). He wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"When Your Excellency decided to permit the sale of our vessels in\r\n     the United States it was too late to do so, because the U.S.\r\n     Government had already seized them. Previous to that, when we saw\r\n     that war would be inevitable, and when we had received an\r\n     exceedingly favourable purchasing offer from an American group, we\r\n     had asked permission to sell part of our tonnage laid up in that\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Excellency, acting on behalf of the Chancellor, declined to\r\n     grant this permission. I am quite aware that neither the Chancellor\r\n     nor Your Excellency as his representative were responsible for this\r\n     refusal, but that it was due to a decision of the Admiralty Staff.\r\n     However, the competent authority to which the protection and the\r\n     furtherance of the country's shipping interests are entrusted is\r\n     the Ministry of the Interior. With the Admiralty Staff itself, as I\r\n     need not remind Your Excellency, we have no dealings whatever, and\r\n     we are not even entitled to approach that body directly in such\r\n     matters.\r\n\r\n     \"Our company which was the biggest undertaking of its kind in the\r\n     world, and which previous to the war possessed a fleet aggregating\r\n     about 1,500,000 tons, has lost practically all its ships except a\r\n     very few. The losses are not so much due to capture on the part of\r\n     the enemy as to the measures taken by our own Government. If our\r\n     Government had acted with the same foresight as did the\r\n     Austro-Hungarian Government with respect to its ships in United\r\n     States and Chinese waters, the German vessels then in Italy,\r\n     Portugal, Greece, the United States, Brazil, and elsewhere, might\r\n     have been either retained by us or disposed of at their full value.\r\n\r\n     \"The Austrian ships, with their dismantled engines were, at the\r\n     instance of the Austrian Government, sold in such good time that\r\n     the shipping companies concerned are not only in a position to-day\r\n     to refrain from asking their Government to pass a Shipowners'\r\n     Compensation Bill, as we are bound to do, but they have even\r\n     enriched the Austrian national wealth by such handsome additions\r\n     that their capital strength has reached a sum never dreamt of\r\n     before, and that they are now able to rebuild their fleet by\r\n     drawing upon their own funds, and to make such further additions to\r\n     their tonnage that in future we shall not only be compelled to\r\n     compete with the shipping companies of neutral and enemy\r\n     countries--which have accumulated phenomenal profits--but with the\r\n     Austrian mercantile marine as well.\r\n\r\n     \"From the point of view of our country's economic interests it is\r\n     greatly to be regretted that the policy of the Government has not\r\n     changed in this respect even now. We have received reliable news\r\n     from private sources to the effect that the engines of the German\r\n     vessels now in Argentine waters have been destroyed without Your\r\n     Excellency having so far informed us of this action, and without\r\n     Your Excellency having asked us to take steps to utilize the\r\n     vessels, if possible, for the benefit of the country's economic\r\n     interests and for that of the completely decimated German merchant\r\n     fleet.\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover, a wire sent by His Excellency Herr v. Jonquières to the\r\n     competent Hamburg and Bremen authorities states that the ships in\r\n     Uruguayan waters are also in great jeopardy. The Government of that\r\n     country, according to this report, would prefer to purchase them\r\n     rather than confiscate them. After what has been done before, we\r\n     fear that the Admiralty Staff will either not permit the sale at\r\n     all, or only grant its permission when it is too late.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Excellency, I am sure, is fully aware of the fact that the\r\n     methods of the Admiralty Staff--ignoring, as it does, all other\r\n     considerations except its own--have caused one country after the\r\n     other to join the ranks of Germany's enemies. In view of the\r\n     shortage of tonnage which Great Britain and other of our enemies\r\n     systematically try to bring about--evidently with the intention of\r\n     inconveniencing neutral countries as much as possible--these latter\r\n     feel compelled, for the very reason of this lack of tonnage, to\r\n     declare war upon us, because the politics of our country are guided\r\n     by a body of men who, unfortunately, shut their eyes to the\r\n     economic and political consequences of their decisions.\r\n\r\n     \"Several months ago, at a time when nobody thought of unrestricted\r\n     submarine warfare, an opportunity presented itself to us of\r\n     concluding an agreement with the Belgian Relief Committee by which\r\n     it would have been possible for us to withdraw our steamers, one\r\n     after the other, from American ports and, under the flag of that\r\n     committee, to bring them to Rotterdam. At that time, it was again\r\n     the Admiralty Staff which prevented the conclusion of this\r\n     agreement, because, for reasons best known to itself, it would\r\n     grant permission for only three of these vessels, although Great\r\n     Britain had agreed that the whole of our fleet interned in U.S.\r\n     ports, representing 250,000 tons in all, could sail under the terms\r\n     of the proposed agreement, and although the Allies as a whole had\r\n     signed a written declaration to the effect that they would not\r\n     interfere with our ships so long as they were used for the\r\n     provisioning of Belgium. I took the liberty of pointing out to\r\n     Captain Grashoff, the representative of the Admiralty Staff, that\r\n     nothing could have prevented us from letting the ships remain at\r\n     Rotterdam after they had completed their mission, and that\r\n     afterwards, as has been borne out by later facts, they could have\r\n     been safely taken to Hamburg.\r\n\r\n     \"I respectfully ask Your Excellency whether it is not possible to\r\n     enter a protest against such unnecessary dismemberment of part of\r\n     the German national assets....\r\n\r\n     \" ... I must also protest most emphatically against the\r\n     insinuation--which is sure to be made--that I have no right to\r\n     criticize any steps which the Admiralty Staff has regarded as\r\n     necessary for reasons of our naval strategy. Without reservation\r\n     the German shipowners agree to any measures which are strategically\r\n     necessary, however greatly they may injure their interests. The\r\n     criticism which I beg to make on behalf of German\r\n     shipping--although possessing no formal mandate--concerns itself\r\n     with those steps which might have been taken without jeopardizing\r\n     the success of our naval strategy if the vital necessities of\r\n     German mercantile shipping had been studied with as much\r\n     consideration as this branch of the economic activities of our\r\n     country has a right to claim.\r\n\r\n     \"What we principally take exception to in this connexion is that no\r\n     information was sent to us before the decision to destroy the\r\n     engines of our ships was arrived at, and that we were not assisted\r\n     in making use of these dismantled vessels in the financial\r\n     interests of our country. Nothing of this kind was done, although\r\n     it was the most natural thing to do so, and although such action\r\n     would have deprived many a country of a reason to declare war upon\r\n     Germany.\"\r\n\r\nTo a man of the type of Ballin--who had, throughout his life, been\r\naccustomed to perform a huge amount of successful work--a period of\r\nenforced inactivity was unbearable. The longer it lasted the more he\r\nsuffered from its effects, especially because the preparatory work for\r\nthe post-war reconstruction, the work connected with the war\r\norganization of the German shipowners, etc., was only a poor substitute\r\nfor the productive labour he had been engaged in during more than thirty\r\nyears of peace. There is no doubt but that the Government could have\r\nmade better use of Ballin's gift of organization, but it must be\r\nremembered that there was really no effective central Government in\r\nGermany throughout the war. The civil administration was not exactly\r\ndeposed, but it was subordinated to the military one from the very\r\nbeginning, and the latter carried on its work along the guiding lines\r\nlaid down in the scheme of mobilization. The authorities to whose care\r\nthe economic aspects of the war were entrusted did not often--if at\r\nall--avail themselves of Ballin's advice; and to offer it unbidden never\r\nentered his mind, because he was cherishing the hope that the war would\r\nnot last long, and because it was his belief that the world would be\r\nsensible enough to put an end to the wholesale destruction before long.\r\nIt was a bitter disappointment to him to find how greatly he was\r\nmistaken, and to see that the forces of unreason remained in the\r\nascendancy, especially as he was always convinced that Time would be on\r\nthe side of Germany's enemies. The sole aim of his political activities\r\nduring the war was to bring about peace as early as possible.\r\n\r\nOf all the attempts at mediation known to me, the one which seemed to be\r\nmost likely to succeed passed through the hands of Ballin. To give a\r\ndetailed account of it must be left to a time which need no longer pay\r\nregard to governments and individuals. Ballin's share in it was brought\r\nabout through his former international connexions. Through him it\r\nreached the Kaiser and the Chancellor, and owing to his untiring\r\nefforts, which lasted for two years, the position in the early part of\r\n1917 was such that the establishment of direct contact between the two\r\nsides was imminent. Then the unrestricted submarine war began, the\r\nintended direct contact could not be established, and the carefully\r\nwoven thread was definitely snapped asunder; because from that time on\r\nthe Allies were certain that the United States would join them, and they\r\nfelt assured of victory. No other mediation scheme with which I am\r\nacquainted has been pursued with so much unselfishness, devotion, and\r\nenergy as this one. This attempt, however, no more than any other, could\r\nhave procured for us that kind of peace which public opinion in Germany\r\nhad been led for years to expect, thanks to the over-estimation of the\r\ncountry's strength, fostered by the military censorship and by the\r\nmilitary reports.\r\n\r\nFrom such exaggerated opinions Ballin always held himself aloof. He\r\nrecognized without reservation the immense achievements of Germany in\r\nthe war, but he was fearful lest the strength of the country could not\r\ncope in the long run with the ever-increasing array of enemies, and he\r\ntherefore maintained that, if it was desired to bring about peace, the\r\nGovernment would have to be moderate in its terms. A much discussed\r\narticle which he contributed to the _Frankfürter Zeitung_ on January\r\n1st, 1915, under the heading of \"The Wet Triangle,\" is not inconsistent\r\nwith these views of his. In it he pointed out that Germany's naval\r\npower, in order to make a future blockade impossible, should no longer\r\nbe content to be shut up in the \"wet triangle,\" i.e. the North Sea, but\r\nought to establish itself on the high seas. This statement has been\r\nalleged to refer to Belgium, and Ballin has been wrongly claimed a\r\npartisan by those who supported the annexation of that country. What he\r\nreally meant was that Germany should demand a naval base on the\r\nAtlantic, somewhere in the northern parts of Africa, and this idea\r\nseemed to be quite realizable if taken in conjunction with the terms of\r\npeace he had in view, viz. no annexations, no indemnities, economic\r\nadvantages, a permanent political and naval understanding with Great\r\nBritain, based on her recognition that a military defeat of Germany was\r\nimpossible. All this would be somewhat on the lines of the article\r\npublished by the _Westminster Gazette_, referred to in the eighth\r\nchapter and a facsimile of which is given at the end of the book. Ballin\r\nwas firmly convinced that, even if a mere peace of compromise was the\r\noutcome, i.e. one which left Germany without any territorial gains and\r\nwithout any indemnities, the impression which the German achievements\r\nduring the war would produce on the rest of the world would be so\r\noverwhelming that the country would secure indirectly far greater\r\nadvantages than could be gained by means of the largest possible\r\nindemnity and the most far-reaching annexations. Besides, the\r\nexperiences of former times had proved that Germany would be quite\r\nunable to absorb such large accessions of territory as certain people\r\nhad in mind. These views of Ballin, of course, were looked upon as those\r\nof a \"pacificist,\" and Ballin was classified among their number.\r\n\r\nIn a letter which Ballin wrote to a friend of his, a naval officer, in\r\nApril, 1915, he puts up a highly characteristic defence of himself\r\nagainst the accusations implied by describing him as \"pacificist\" and\r\n\"pro-English.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If,\" he wrote, \"the fact that I have been privileged to spend a\r\n     considerable part of my life in close contact with you, entitles me\r\n     to add a few personal remarks, I should like to say that I have\r\n     made up my mind to retire from my post after the end of the war\r\n     altogether. I told you shortly after the outbreak of the war that\r\n     my life's work was wrecked. To-day I am convinced that it will soon\r\n     come to life again, but my youth would have to be restored to me\r\n     before I could ever dream of taking up again that position in\r\n     international shipping which I held before the war. I cannot\r\n     imagine that I would ever go to London again and take the chair at\r\n     the conferences at which the great problems of international\r\n     shipping would come up for discussion, and nobody, I think, can\r\n     expect that I should be content to play second fiddle at my age.\r\n     Indeed, I cannot see how I could ever re-enter upon intimate\r\n     relations with the British, the French, the Italians, and\r\n     especially with the Americans. Strangely enough, influential\r\n     circles on our side, and even His Majesty himself, look upon me as\r\n     'pro-English,' and yet I am the only German who can say with truth\r\n     that he has been fighting the English for supremacy in the shipping\r\n     world during the last thirty years. During this long period I have,\r\n     if I am allowed to make use of so bold a comparison, conquered one\r\n     British trench after the other, and I have renewed my attacks\r\n     whenever I could find the means for doing so.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that during the war many prominent politicians and\r\neconomists--men of sound political training--viewed the question of the\r\nwar aims which it was desirable to realize very much in the same light\r\nas did Ballin, but that the censorship made it impossible for anyone to\r\ngive public expression to such opinions. Ballin's appreciation of the\r\nprobable gain which Germany would derive from a peace by compromise has\r\nnow been amply confirmed by the undeniable fact that the rest of the\r\nworld has been tremendously impressed by Germany's achievements, an\r\nimpression which has made foreigners regard her chances of recovery with\r\nmuch more confidence than she has felt herself, stunned as she was by\r\nthe immensity of her _débâcle_.\r\n\r\nThe following notes, which are largely based on Ballin's own diary, are\r\nintended to supplement the information given so far as to his political\r\nactivities during the war.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war, as may be inferred from what has already been\r\nrelated, took him completely by surprise, and he did not think that the\r\nstruggle would last very long. \"The necessities of the world's commerce\r\nwill not stand a long war,\" was his opinion during the early days. For\r\nthe rest, he tried to find work for himself which would benefit his\r\ncountry. \"What we need to-day,\" he wrote to a friend, \"is work. This\r\nwill lift us up and keep us going, and will make those of us who are no\r\nlonger fit to fight feel that we are still of some use after all.\" But\r\nin connexion with this thought another one began to occupy his mind. He\r\nanxiously asked: \"Which of the men now at headquarters will have the\r\nstrength and the wisdom required to negotiate a successful peace when\r\nthe time comes?\" All his thoughts centred round the one idea of how to\r\nsecure peace; what advantages his country would derive from it; and how\r\nit would be possible to bring about an international grouping of the\r\nPowers which would be of the greatest benefit to Germany. On October\r\n1st, 1914, he wrote to Grand Admiral v. Tirpitz:\r\n\r\n     \" ... I quite agree with what you say in your welcome letter.\r\n     Indeed, you could not view these matters[3] with graver anxiety\r\n     than I do myself. I hope I shall soon have the opportunity I desire\r\n     of discussing these things with you personally.\r\n\r\n     \"To win the peace will be hardly less difficult than to win the\r\n     war. My opinion is that the result of this world war, if it lasts\r\n     12 months, will be exactly the same as if it lasts six months. I\r\n     mean to say that, if we do not succeed in acquiring the guarantees\r\n     for our compensation demands within a few months, the further\r\n     progress of events will not appreciably improve our chances in this\r\n     direction.\r\n\r\n     \"What we must aim at is a new grouping of the Powers round an\r\n     alliance between Germany, Great Britain and France. This alliance\r\n     will become possible as soon as we shall have vanquished France and\r\n     Belgium, and as soon as you shall have made up your mind to bring\r\n     about an understanding with Great Britain concerning the naval\r\n     programme.\r\n\r\n     \"I am aware that this idea will find but slight favour with you,\r\n     but you will never secure a reasonable peace with Great Britain\r\n     without a naval agreement.\r\n\r\n     \"By a reasonable peace I mean one which will enable both Germany\r\n     and Britain to sheathe their swords in honour, and which will not\r\n     burden either nation with a hatred which would contain within it\r\n     the germs of future war.\r\n\r\n     \"We have had no difficulty in putting up with the French clamour\r\n     for _revanche_ for a period of 44 years, because in this case we\r\n     had only to deal with a small group of nationalist firebrands, but\r\n     a British clamour for revenge would produce an exceedingly adverse\r\n     effect on the future of our national well-being and of our share in\r\n     the world's trade and commerce.\r\n\r\n     \"For a long time past it has been my conviction that the era of the\r\n     super-Dreadnoughts has passed, and some time ago I asked Admiral\r\n     von Müller if it was not possible to consider the question of a\r\n     naval understanding simply on the basis of an agreement as to the\r\n     sum of money which either Government should be entitled to spend\r\n     annually on naval construction, leaving it to the discretion of\r\n     each side how to make use of the money agreed upon for the building\r\n     of the various types of ships.\r\n\r\n     \"Great Britain is putting up a fight for her existence just as much\r\n     as we do, if not to an even greater extent. Her continuance as a\r\n     world power depends on the superiority--the numerical superiority\r\n     at least--of her navy.\r\n\r\n     \"I am convinced--always supposing that we shall succeed in\r\n     conquering France and Belgium--that the British terms concerning\r\n     her naval supremacy will be very moderate, and I cannot help\r\n     thinking that a fair understanding regarding naval construction is\r\n     just as important to Germany as it is to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"The present state of things is the outcome of a _circulus\r\n     vitiosus_, and is bound to produce a soreness which will never\r\n     permit of a sound understanding....\r\n\r\n     \" ... And what about the further course of the war? I sincerely\r\n     hope that your Excellency will not risk the navy. The expression\r\n     'The Fleet in being' which has never left my memory, and which has\r\n     lately been heard of again, implies exactly all I mean.\r\n\r\n     \"The navy, in my opinion, has never been, and never ought to be,\r\n     anything but the indispensable reserve of a healthy international\r\n     policy. Just as a conscientious director-general would never dream\r\n     of reducing the reserve funds of his company, unless compelled to\r\n     do so by sheer necessity, we ought not to drag the navy into the\r\n     war, if it could possibly be avoided.\r\n\r\n     \"What would it profit you to risk a naval battle on the high seas?\r\n     Not only our own, but British experts as well, believe that our\r\n     ships, our officers, and our crews are superior to the British, and\r\n     King Edward emphasized at every opportunity that the crews on\r\n     British warships are not a match to those on German vessels. But\r\n     what are you going to do? Are you going to make them fight against\r\n     a numerically superior enemy? Such a course would be open to great\r\n     objections, and even, if the battle turned out successfully, the\r\n     victors would not escape serious damage.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not know how your Excellency, and their Excellencies v.\r\n     Müller and Pohl look upon these matters, but since you yourself\r\n     have asked me to state my views, I hope you will not take it amiss\r\n     if my zeal causes me to enlarge upon a subject which is not quite\r\n     within my province. Besides, I have another reason for doing so.\r\n\r\n     \"It is our duty to prepare ourselves in good time for the peace\r\n     that is to come. Does your Excellency believe it would augur well\r\n     for the future peace if Germany succeeded in inflicting a naval\r\n     victory on the British? I do not think so myself, but I rather\r\n     fancy that the opposite effect would take place.... If the British\r\n     should suffer a big naval defeat, they would be forced to fight to\r\n     the bitter end. That is inherent in the nature of things; even\r\n     those who can only argue in terms of a Continental policy must\r\n     understand it.\r\n\r\n     \"Even a partial loss of her naval prestige would spell ruin to\r\n     Great Britain. It would imply the defection of the great dominions\r\n     which now form part of her world empire. The _raison d'être_ for\r\n     Great Britain's present position ceases to exist as soon as she has\r\n     lost her naval supremacy....\r\n\r\n     \" ... And, please, do not lose sight of one further consideration.\r\n     We must find our compensation by annexing valuable territories\r\n     beyond the seas; but for the peaceful enjoyment of such overseas\r\n     gains we shall be dependent on the good will of Great Britain....\r\n     At present, men of German blood occupy leading positions in the\r\n     economic life of almost every British colony, and the open door has\r\n     been the means by which we have acquired a great deal of that\r\n     national wealth of ours which caused the smooth working of our\r\n     financial mobilization when the war broke out.\r\n\r\n     \" ... For all these reasons I consider it a great mistake that the\r\n     press should be allowed to excite German public opinion against\r\n     Great Britain to the extent it is done. I was in Berlin during the\r\n     week, and I was alarmed when I became acquainted with the wild\r\n     schemes which are entertained not only by the people of Berlin, but\r\n     also by distinguished men from the Rhineland and Westphalia.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the peace problem there was another matter which gave Ballin\r\ngrave cause for anxiety. This was the circumstance that the Kaiser,\r\nbecause of his long absences from Berlin, lost the necessary touch with\r\nthe people, and could not, therefore, be kept properly informed of\r\npopular feeling. He expressed his fears on this account in a letter to a\r\nfriend of his amongst the Kaiser's entourage in which he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"I hope you will soon be able to induce His Majesty to remove his\r\n     winter quarters to Germany. My common sense tells me that, if a war\r\n     is waged on French and Russian soil, the headquarters ought to be\r\n     situated in Germany. From the point of view of security also I\r\n     consider this very desirable, and I feel a great deal of anxiety\r\n     concerning His Majesty.... Whether it is wise to exercise the\r\n     censorship of the press to the extent it is done, is a question on\r\n     which more opinions than one are possible.... I have just had a\r\n     call from a Mr. X., a former officer, and an exceedingly reliable\r\n     and capable man. He complained bitterly of the rigid censorship,\r\n     and he thought it would be a mistake from which we should have to\r\n     suffer in days to come. It would certainly be a blessing if such a\r\n     man who is highly esteemed by the Foreign Office could be given a\r\n     chance of explaining his views at headquarters.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the problems of foreign policy with which Germany saw herself\r\nfaced in the early part of the war, those referring to Italy and\r\nRoumania were of special interest to Ballin. The question was how to\r\nprevent these two countries from joining the ranks of Germany's enemies.\r\nBallin did all he could to bring about the Italian mission of Prince\r\nBülow. He not only urged the Chancellor to select Bülow for this task,\r\nbut he also tried hard to induce the Prince to undertake the thankless\r\nerrand involved. In addition to the political importance of the mission,\r\nhe laid great stress on its bearing on the food problem.\r\n\r\n     \"The question of provisioning the German people,\" he wrote in a\r\n     letter to the Army Headquarters, \"is closely connected with the\r\n     solution of the Italian and Roumanian difficulties. No pressure is,\r\n     in my opinion, too strong in order to make it perfectly clear to\r\n     Austria that some sort of an agreement with Italy is a _sine qua\r\n     non_ for the successful termination of this war. If it were argued\r\n     that Italy would come forward with fresh demands as soon as her\r\n     original claims had been satisfied, I think the German Government\r\n     could combat this objection by insisting upon a written promise on\r\n     the part of Italy to the effect that she would not extend her\r\n     demands.\r\n\r\n     \" ... Political and military considerations make it plain beyond\r\n     any question of doubt that Italy, who will be armed to the teeth in\r\n     March, will not be able to lay down her arms again unless Austria\r\n     arrives at an understanding with her. Thus our greatest danger is\r\n     the uncertainty as to what these neutrals will do, and I hope that\r\n     the ministerial changes in Austria will smooth the way for a\r\n     reasonable attitude towards this regrettable but unavoidable\r\n     necessity. Our aim should be to prevent the scattering of our\r\n     forces, for the burden imposed upon ourselves because of the\r\n     inadequacy of our allies is almost superhuman, and contains the\r\n     danger of exhaustion.\"\r\n\r\nThe German mission to Italy suffered through the vacillations of\r\nAustrian politics, and was therefore doomed to failure. Austrian feeling\r\nconcerning a compromise with Italy was always dependent on the news from\r\nthe Italian front; if this was favourable, people did not want to hear\r\nof it, and in the opposite case they would only discuss such an\r\nunderstanding most unwillingly. The proposed compromise was looked upon\r\nas a heavy sacrifice, and people were by no means favourably disposed\r\ntowards German mediation. Prince Bülow was accused of having \"presented\r\nItaly with the Trentino.\" Disquieting news which Ballin received from\r\nVienna induced him to report to the Chancellor on the state of Austrian\r\nfeeling, and to offer his services if he thought that his\r\nold-established relations with Vienna could be of any use. His offer was\r\nalso prompted by his conviction that the German diplomatic\r\nrepresentation in Vienna was not adapted to Austrian mentality.\r\n\r\nThereupon Ballin, early in March, 1915, entered upon a semi-official\r\nmission to Vienna. He first acquainted himself with the actual state of\r\nthe Austrian mind by calling on his old friend, his Excellency v.\r\nSchulz, the Vice-President of the Austrian Chief Court of Audits, who\r\nwas regarded as one of the best informed personages in the capital, and\r\nwho was one of the regular partners of the old Emperor Francis Joseph\r\nfor his daily game of tarock. This gentleman told Ballin that the\r\npeople of Austria felt a good deal of resentment towards Germany, who\r\nhad stepped in far too early as the \"advocate of Italy,\" at a time when\r\nAustria was still hoping to settle Serbia all by herself. This hope,\r\nindeed, had proved an illusion; but Germany's strategy had also turned\r\nout a failure, because she had misjudged the attitude of Great Britain,\r\nand had not finished with France as rapidly as she had expected to do.\r\nNow Austria, confronted by stern necessity, would have to make\r\nconcessions to Italy which every true Austrian would view with bitter\r\ngrief; and, to bring about the active assistance of Roumania, Count\r\nTisza would consider a sacrifice in the Bukovina debatable, but never\r\none in Transylvania. Ballin told his friend that, as far as Roumania was\r\nconcerned, he would have to leave it to Austria to settle that question\r\nby herself; and that his mission with regard to Italy was so difficult\r\nthat he preferred not to make it more so by trying to solve the\r\nRoumanian problem as well.\r\n\r\nBallin's subsequent interviews with the Prime Minister, Count Stürgkh,\r\nand with the Minister v. Koerber, as well as those with other\r\ninfluential personages, confirmed these impressions, and he left Vienna\r\nbuoyed up by the hope that the conference between German, Austrian, and\r\nItalian delegates which it was proposed to hold at Vienna would lead to\r\na successful result. Such, however, was not the case, and it is quite\r\nprobable that the possibility of arriving at an understanding with Italy\r\nhad passed by that time, or, assuming the most favourable circumstances,\r\nthat only immediate and far-reaching Austrian concessions could have\r\nsaved the situation; but these were not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe next subject which caused much anxiety to Ballin was the question as\r\nto what Roumania would do, a country to whose attitude, considering her\r\nimportance to Germany as a food-producing area, he attached even more\r\nvalue than to that of Italy. In his notes dating from that time he said:\r\n\r\n     \" ... June 21st, 1915. The news which I received from X. regarding\r\n     the political situation in Roumania and Bulgaria was so serious\r\n     that I felt bound to send copies of these letters to the Chief of\r\n     the General Staff, General v. Falkenhayn, and to inform him that,\r\n     in my opinion, our Foreign Office had now done all it could\r\n     possibly do, and that nothing but some forcible military pressure\r\n     such as he and Baron Conrad could exercise on Count Tisza would\r\n     induce this obstinate gentleman to settle his differences with the\r\n     Balkan States....\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... On this occasion X. expressed a great deal of contempt at the\r\n     suggestion that we should draw upon the members of the old\r\n     diplomacy for additional help. On the whole, he seemed to be very\r\n     proud of the achievements of the Foreign Office, whereas I am of\r\n     opinion that this body has entirely failed, and is of no practical\r\n     use any longer. Things must be in a pretty bad state if Herr\r\n     Erzberger, of all people, is looked upon as the last hope of the\r\n     country. I suggested to the gentlemen that it would do some good if\r\n     the Chancellor were to request the more virulent of the Pan-Germans\r\n     to see him, and to ask Hindenburg to explain to them the military\r\n     situation without any camouflage. This suggestion was favourably\r\n     received, and it is to be passed on to the Chancellor....\r\n\r\n     \" ... The Chancellor informed me that he was considering whether,\r\n     if Roumania remained neutral, and if the operations against the\r\n     Dardanelles terminated successfully for us, he ought to submit any\r\n     official proposals for peace to our enemies. I expressed my\r\n     admiration of the plan, but told the Chancellor of my objections to\r\n     its practical execution. The Entente, I feared, would refuse to\r\n     entertain the proposals, and the German people would regard it as a\r\n     sign of weakness. The Chancellor asked me to refrain from\r\n     pronouncing a definite opinion for the present, but to think it\r\n     over until our next meeting.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter of July 31st, 1915, Ballin wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I should like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for sending\r\n     on to me the report which contains some of the finest observations\r\n     that have come to my knowledge since the outbreak of the war.\r\n\r\n     \" ... The writer lays great stress on the belief prevalent in enemy\r\n     and neutral countries alike that Germany is making a bid for\r\n     universal supremacy and for supremacy on the high seas--a belief\r\n     which has spurred on the resistance of the enemy to the utmost, and\r\n     has caused a good deal of bad feeling amongst the neutrals. I\r\n     repeatedly brought this fact to the knowledge of the Chancellor and\r\n     I urgently suggested to him that in some way--e.g., by an Imperial\r\n     proclamation on the anniversary of the outbreak of war, or by some\r\n     other suitable means--we should announce to all and sundry that\r\n     such hare-brained schemes are not entertained by any responsible\r\n     person or body of persons in Germany. I sincerely trust that some\r\n     such steps will be taken at an early opportunity, because otherwise\r\n     I do not see when the war will be over. Though not a pessimist I do\r\n     not believe in taking too rosy a view of things. I envy the British\r\n     because they have the courage openly to discuss in their press and\r\n     parliament the reverses as well as the successes they have had.\r\n\r\n     \" ... You see I am not taking too cheerful a view of matters. I\r\n     have nothing but the most enthusiastic admiration for the\r\n     achievements of the German people, both at the front and at home.\r\n     Although not gifted politically this people could do wonders if led\r\n     by great statesmen and by great politicians.\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... August 10th, 1915. This morning I spent an hour with the\r\n     Chancellor, who had requested me to call on him.... We had a long\r\n     discussion as to the advisability of publishing a statement to the\r\n     effect that Germany would be ready at any moment to discuss an\r\n     honourable peace. She had achieved great successes in the field,\r\n     she was in possession of important mortgages, her armies were\r\n     occupying large tracts of the enemy's country, and she was not\r\n     carrying on a war of aggression but one of defence: therefore such\r\n     a step could not be regarded as a sign of weakness. The\r\n     Chancellor, nevertheless, was afraid that such a step might after\r\n     all be interpreted in that sense. I suggested to him that it might\r\n     be of some use if the Pope could be induced to address a peace\r\n     message to the rulers of the various countries.\r\n\r\n     \"I also called the Chancellor's urgent attention to the need for\r\n     dealing with the food problem during the ensuing winter, especially\r\n     with relation to the price of meat.\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... August 12th, 1915. The United States Ambassador, Mr. Gerard,\r\n     had expressed the desire to discuss with me the question as to the\r\n     advisability of suggesting that President Wilson should mediate\r\n     between the belligerents. I therefore called on him on Tuesday,\r\n     August 10th, and advised him to refrain from any official action in\r\n     that direction, but said that I thought he might ask the President\r\n     to sound opinion in Great Britain as to the chances of such peace\r\n     proposals.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of September, 1915, Admiral v. Holtzendorff was\r\nappointed Chief of the Admiralty Staff. This appointment gave rise to a\r\nconflict with Grand Admiral v. Tirpitz, who threatened to resign\r\nbecause, _inter alia_, the Kaiser had issued instructions to the effect\r\nthat the Chief of the Admiralty Staff should no longer be subject to the\r\nauthority of the Secretary for the Navy, but that he could communicate\r\nwith the Kaiser and with the Chancellor direct. Ballin thought a\r\npossible resignation of Admiral v. Tirpitz would be fraught with serious\r\nconsequences at that moment, as it would produce a bad impression on\r\npublic opinion and be inimical to the position of the Kaiser. These\r\nconsiderations caused Ballin to intervene in person with Admiral v.\r\nTirpitz and with the Chief of the Naval Cabinet, with the result that\r\nthe Grand Admiral withdrew his intended resignation.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are taken from Ballin's notes during the next few\r\nmonths:\r\n\r\n     \" ... October 20th, 1915. I am annoyed at the importunity with\r\n     which some interested parties, such as the Central Association of\r\n     German Manufacturers and the representatives of agriculture, are\r\n     pushing forward their views on the peace terms. Moreover, my\r\n     alleged readiness to conclude a 'bad peace' with Great Britain is\r\n     being talked about so widely that even His Excellency Herr v.\r\n     Zimmermann has drawn my attention to the ill effects of such\r\n     calumnies. All this has prompted me to avail myself of the\r\n     opportunity presented by the annual meeting of the Association of\r\n     Hamburg Shipowners of making a speech in which I have explained my\r\n     views as to the freedom of the seas.\r\n\r\n     \"Prince Bülow will be leaving for Lucerne to-day where he intends\r\n     to stay for some time, and the Prussian _chargé d'affaires_, Herr\r\n     v. Mutius--of whom it has been alleged that the Chancellor\r\n     appointed him to his post on the death of his predecessor (the\r\n     excellent Herr v. Bülow, Prussian Minister to Hamburg) for the\r\n     reason that he might have a watchful eye on Prince Bülow and\r\n     myself--has been promptly transferred to Warsaw. Evidently the\r\n     Berlin authorities now think the danger has passed, since Prince\r\n     Bülow has left.\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... November 23rd, 1915. Hammann[4] asked me why I did not call\r\n     on the Chancellor, and I told him that I thought the Chancellor\r\n     might feel annoyed with me for my interference in favour of\r\n     Tirpitz, which, however, would not affect me in any way, because I\r\n     was convinced that I had acted in the best interests of the Kaiser,\r\n     and that it would have been unwise to remove Tirpitz from his post\r\n     so long as the war lasted.\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... The Chancellor asked me to see him on Wednesday at 6.30 p.m.,\r\n     and I spent nearly two hours with him. I urgently advised him to\r\n     make a frank statement in the Reichstag as to our readiness for\r\n     peace, and to do so in such a form that it could not possibly be\r\n     looked upon as a sign of weakness.\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... On January 10th, 1916, I was commanded to dine with Their\r\n     Majesties at the _Neues Palais_. The only other guests apart from\r\n     myself were the Minister of the Royal Household, Count Eulenburg,\r\n     and the Minister of Agriculture, Herr v. Schorlemer. None of the\r\n     suite were present so that the company consisted of five persons\r\n     only. The Kaiser was in high spirits and full of confidence. The\r\n     after-dinner conversation extended to such a late hour that we did\r\n     not catch the train by which we intended to return, and we were\r\n     obliged to leave by the last train that night.\r\n\r\n     \"A remark of mine concerning the possibility of an extension of\r\n     submarine warfare had, as the Chancellor had been informed, caused\r\n     the Kaiser to assume that I completely shared the point of view of\r\n     Admirals v. Holtzendorff and v. Tirpitz, who now recommend a\r\n     submarine campaign against Great Britain on a large scale. I\r\n     therefore, at the Chancellor's request, addressed the following\r\n     letter to the Kaiser:\r\n\r\n     \"'A few days ago I had occasion to discuss with Grand Admiral v.\r\n     Tirpitz and Admiral v. Holtzendorff the question of a resumption of\r\n     the submarine campaign.\r\n\r\n     \"'I was then given confidential information as to the number of\r\n     submarines at our disposal, and I am bound to say that even if due\r\n     allowance is made for the activity of the mine-seeking auxiliaries\r\n     I regard the number of large submarines as insufficient for the\r\n     purposes of such a finally decisive measure.\r\n\r\n     \"'The first attempt at submarine warfare proved unsuccessful on\r\n     account of the insufficiency of the means employed to carry it\r\n     through; and it is my humble opinion that a second attempt should\r\n     only be undertaken if its success were beyond the possibility of a\r\n     doubt. If this cannot be guaranteed the consequences of such a\r\n     measure appear to me to be out of all proportion to the risks\r\n     attached to it.\r\n\r\n     \"'I therefore beg to respectfully suggest to Your Majesty that the\r\n     work of the mine-laying auxiliaries should be carried on as\r\n     hitherto, and should even be extended. I also consider that the\r\n     submarines should be made use of to the fullest extent of their\r\n     capacity, with the proviso, however, that their employment against\r\n     passenger steamers should be subject to the restrictions recently\r\n     laid down by Your Majesty.\r\n\r\n     \"'When the number of the big submarines shall be sufficient\r\n     effectively to cut off the British food supply, I think the time\r\n     will have arrived for us to employ this weapon against Great\r\n     Britain without paying regard to the so-called neutrals.\r\n\r\n     \"'At present about two hundred ocean steamers or more enter\r\n     British ports every day, and an equal number leave for foreign\r\n     ports. If we sink a daily average of 30 or 40 we can, indeed,\r\n     greatly inconvenience England, but we shall assuredly not be able\r\n     to compel her to sue for peace.\r\n\r\n     \"'I humbly apologize to Your Majesty for thus stating my views on\r\n     this matter; but I am of opinion that the extreme importance of the\r\n     proposed steps will be a sufficient excuse for me.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1916 Ballin went on a second mission to Vienna, and\r\nafterwards he prepared a detailed report for the Chancellor dealing with\r\nthe state of public feeling as he found it. This document presents a\r\nfaithful picture of the precarious conditions in that capital which the\r\nGerman Government had constantly to reckon with, and may therefore be of\r\ninterest even now. The following passages are extracts from it:\r\n\r\n     \"If we desire to keep the Austrian fighting spirit unimpaired we\r\n     must avoid at all hazards suggesting the possibility of an\r\n     understanding with Italy. The Italian war is popular down to the\r\n     lowest classes of the people, and the successful stand against\r\n     Italy is a subject of pride and hope to all Austrians.\r\n\r\n     \"Hence the circumstance that Prince Bülow has temporarily taken up\r\n     his abode at Lucerne has roused a considerable amount of suspicion.\r\n     Even the officials in the various ministerial departments fear that\r\n     the Prince might intend to make unofficial advances to Italy when\r\n     in Lucerne, and that these steps might be followed in Berlin by a\r\n     movement in favour of a separate peace with Italy by which Austria\r\n     would have to cede the Trentino. People were obviously pleased and\r\n     relieved when I could explain to them that the Prince was greatly\r\n     embarrassed on account of having lost his Villa Malta, and that the\r\n     choice of a suitable residence during the winter had been very\r\n     difficult. They were particularly gratified when I told them--what\r\n     I had heard from the Prince's own lips--that he had had no official\r\n     mission, and that he had not been engaged upon any negotiations.\r\n\r\n     \"People are especially proud of the Isonzo battles, but they do not\r\n     shut their eyes to the uncertain prospects of a successful Austrian\r\n     offensive. They really consider that Austria has gained her war\r\n     aims, and the old Emperor described the military situation to Frau\r\n     Kathi Schratt by saying that the war was in many respects like a\r\n     game of tarock, in which the winner was not allowed to cease\r\n     playing because the losers insisted upon him going on with the game\r\n     so that they might have their revenge. Matters at first had been to\r\n     the advantage of our enemies: the Russians had overrun Galicia, the\r\n     Serbians had defeated the Austrians at Belgrade, and the French had\r\n     looked upon the retreat from the Marne as a great success. Now,\r\n     however, the war was all in favour of Germany and Austria, and\r\n     therefore our opponents did not want to call a truce just yet.\r\n\r\n     \"If this comparison which the venerable old gentleman has borrowed\r\n     from his favourite game of cards is correct, the war will not be\r\n     over until one side has nothing further to stake, and the decision\r\n     will be brought about by that side whose human and financial\r\n     resources shall last longest.\r\n\r\n     \"Banking circles, of course, view the financial situation with the\r\n     utmost gravity, but the general public--in spite of the high prices\r\n     ruling here, and in spite of the great want of food which is much\r\n     more noticeable than with us--regard matters a great deal more\r\n     serenely. This is simply due to the greater optimism so\r\n     characteristic of the Austrians, whose motto is: 'Life is so short,\r\n     and death so very, very long.' They prefer to assign to future\r\n     generations the worries which would spoil their sublunary\r\n     existence.\r\n\r\n     \"The present Cabinet is looked upon as weak and mediocre. The old\r\n     Emperor clings to Count Stürgkh because of the extensive use to\r\n     which the latter puts the celebrated paragraph 14 of the\r\n     Constitution, by which Parliament is eliminated altogether, and\r\n     which provides the Government with every conceivable liberty of\r\n     action. The all-powerful Tisza gives his support to Count Stürgkh\r\n     just because of his weakness. Hence the attempt to replace the\r\n     latter by Prince Hohenlohe, the present Minister of the Interior,\r\n     is beset with much difficulty. The Emperor wants to avoid a break\r\n     with Tisza at all costs. This state of things makes people feel\r\n     very worried. The strain in the relations between Austria and\r\n     Hungary has greatly increased since my last visit, whereas the\r\n     friendly feelings for Germany are now more pronounced than ever.\r\n\r\n     \"Our Kaiser everywhere enjoys an unexampled veneration. Within the\r\n     next few days he will be made the subject of great celebrations in\r\n     his honour. Although the tickets of admission are sold at enormous\r\n     prices, even General v. Georgi, the Chief of the National Defence\r\n     Organization--whom I met last night--did not succeed in obtaining a\r\n     box, notwithstanding his high connexions. This morning the\r\n     well-known member of the Hofburg Theatre, Herr Georg Reimers, read\r\n     to me two poems dedicated to the Kaiser which he is going to recite\r\n     that night, and I feel bound to say that it can hardly be an\r\n     unmixed pleasure to the members of the court to witness this act of\r\n     enthusiastic homage paid to our ruler.\r\n\r\n     \"The Roumanian question, particularly in its bearing on the food\r\n     supply, is regarded by people who are able to judge with great\r\n     anxiety. It is believed that the only thing to do is to send to\r\n     Bucharest experienced men connected with the supply and the\r\n     distribution of food who must be properly authorized to purchase as\r\n     much grain as possible for ourselves and for our allies.\r\n\r\n     \"The big Austro-German _Zollverein_--or by whatever other name it\r\n     is intended to describe the proposed customs union--is looked upon\r\n     with very mixed feelings. Last night Baron Skoda (the Austrian\r\n     Krupp) explained to me after a dinner given at his house, with the\r\n     lively consent of members of the court and of the big\r\n     manufacturers, that the Austrian interests might indeed profit from\r\n     such a union with the Balkan States, but that it would be better\r\n     that Germany should remain an outsider for a period of fifteen\r\n     years. This is evidently a case of _timeo Danaos, et dona\r\n     ferentes_, and people feel that Austria, owing to her economic\r\n     exhaustion, would be easily absorbed by Germany after the\r\n     conclusion of the war. The Hungarians, naturally, view matters from\r\n     a different angle, not only because the Hungarian farmers would\r\n     like to sell their grain to Germany free of any duty, and because\r\n     industry counts for very little in their country, but also because\r\n     they dislike the Austrians.\r\n\r\n     \" ... I also dined with Count Tisza. He is a purely Magyar\r\n     politician who regards the international situation from his\r\n     Hungarian point of view, and in conformity with his Magyar\r\n     inclinations. He is evidently a strong if obstinate character, and\r\n     he does not impress me as a man who will give up his post without a\r\n     protest. He, too, thinks the real war aims of Austria-Hungary have\r\n     been accomplished. Serbia is crushed, Galicia liberated, and\r\n     Russian supremacy in the Balkans--formerly viewed with so much\r\n     apprehension--is a thing of the past. All that is wanting now is to\r\n     bring the Italian campaign to a successful conclusion and the war\r\n     may be regarded as over as far as Austro-Hungarian interests are\r\n     involved.\r\n\r\n     \"Both Tisza and the Austrian society showed strong symptoms of an\r\n     Anglophile leaning. Frau Schratt, who in such matters simply\r\n     re-echoes the views of the old Emperor, seemed very pro-English,\r\n     and had something to say about 'German atrocities.'\r\n\r\n     \"I mention these facts because I cannot help thinking that,\r\n     notwithstanding the war, some friendly threads must have been spun\r\n     across from England to Austria.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of an unrestricted submarine war, already touched upon by\r\nBallin in his above-mentioned letter to the Kaiser written in January,\r\n1916, was discussed with much animation in the course of the year, and a\r\npowerful propaganda in its favour was started by certain quarters.\r\nBallin's attitude towards this question, and particularly towards its\r\nbearing on the possible entry of the United States into the war, is\r\ndescribed with great clearness in a letter addressed to a friend of his\r\nattached to the Army Headquarters. In this message he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \" ... You ask me to tell you something about the political and\r\n     military situation as I see it, and I shall gladly comply with your\r\n     wish.\r\n\r\n     \"The American danger seems to be averted for the moment at least. A\r\n     severance of diplomatic relations with the United States would\r\n     have been nothing short of fatal to Germany at the present stage.\r\n     Just because the war may be looked upon as won in a military sense,\r\n     we were obliged to avoid such a catastrophe at all costs. As far as\r\n     military exertions are concerned, it is quite correct to say that\r\n     Germany has won the war, because in order to turn the present\r\n     position into a military defeat our enemies, in the first instance,\r\n     would have to gain military victories in Russia, France, and\r\n     Belgium. These would have to be followed up by our retreat from the\r\n     occupied countries and by their invasion of ours, and they would\r\n     have to defeat us at home. Every sensible critic must see that\r\n     neither their human material nor their organizing powers are\r\n     sufficient for such achievements. The fact is that we have reached\r\n     the final stage of a progressive war of exhaustion, which nothing\r\n     but the intervention of the United States could have prolonged.\r\n\r\n     \"The accession of Italy to the ranks of our opponents has shown\r\n     what it means if an additional Power enters the war against us.\r\n     From a military point of view the entry of Italy did not materially\r\n     aggravate our position; but the whole aspect of the war, as viewed\r\n     by our enemies, underwent a complete change, and Grey, who shortly\r\n     before had announced that 'there is nothing between us and Germany\r\n     except Belgium,' stated a few weeks subsequent to the Italian\r\n     _volte-face_ that he could not find a suitable basis for peace\r\n     negotiations anywhere.\r\n\r\n     \"The entry of the United States would have been of immeasurably\r\n     greater effect on the imagination and the obstinacy of our enemies.\r\n\r\n     \"The very intelligent gentlemen who even now preach the\r\n     unrestricted submarine war, especially the leading members of the\r\n     Conservative and National Liberal parties, are misinformed about\r\n     what the submarines can do. They not only regard it as possible,\r\n     but even as practically certain, that the starvation of Great\r\n     Britain could be achieved if the unrestricted submarine war were\r\n     introduced. I need not tell Your Excellency that such an assumption\r\n     fails to estimate things at their true value. Great Britain will\r\n     always be able to maintain her connexion with the French Channel\r\n     ports. Quite apart from that, she will always succeed in importing\r\n     the 14,000 tons of cereals which she needs every day to feed her\r\n     population even if the number of our submarines is trebled, because\r\n     it must not be forgotten that the submarines cannot operate during\r\n     the night.\r\n\r\n     \"Hence the whole problem is now, as ever, governed by the axiom to\r\n     which I have over and over again drawn the attention of the heads\r\n     of the Berlin economic associations, viz. that we can no more force\r\n     the British into subjection through our submarines than they can\r\n     hope to wear us out by their starvation blockade. Both the\r\n     submarine war and the blockade are extremely disastrous measures,\r\n     inflicting heavy losses on either side; but neither of them can\r\n     determine the fate of the war nor bring about a fundamental\r\n     improvement in the position of either of the belligerent groups of\r\n     Powers. That, apart from all other considerations, the unrestricted\r\n     submarine war would have exposed us to the open hostility of the\r\n     neutral countries, and might even have caused them to join the\r\n     ranks of our enemies, is an additional contingency which the\r\n     submarine enthusiasts have found it most convenient to dismiss by a\r\n     wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n     \"If after the war Germany remains isolated from the rest of the\r\n     world, she cannot feed her population, and the doctrine of Central\r\n     European brotherhood promulgated by some of our amiable poets has\r\n     given rise to a movement which is apt to be of the greatest\r\n     detriment to the interests of our country when the war is over.\r\n\r\n     \"If we had wished to invest large parts of our German national\r\n     wealth in countries like Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey,\r\n     nothing could have prevented us from realizing such a plan at any\r\n     time previous to the war, provided we had thought it economically\r\n     sound.\r\n\r\n     \"Such a return to a continental policy, I maintain, would be a\r\n     disaster to Germany. Our needs and our aspirations have increased\r\n     to such an extent that we can no longer hope to satisfy them by\r\n     economic isolation or within the framework of a Central European\r\n     economic league of states.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not because I am at the head of the biggest German shipping\r\n     concern that I tell you these things, but I do so with the\r\n     disinterestedness of a man who hopes to be allowed to retire into\r\n     private life when this terrible war is over. No one can perform\r\n     his life's work more than once, and no one can make a fresh start\r\n     at the age of sixty.\r\n\r\n     \"The war has considerably strengthened the moral fibre of the\r\n     Chancellor; he has learnt to take upon his shoulders\r\n     responsibilities which, I think, he would formerly have shirked. It\r\n     is much to be regretted that the Conservative party cannot see eye\r\n     to eye with him in so many questions. He is blamed for the fact\r\n     that the Kaiser is so difficult of access, and that he does not\r\n     every now and then receive the leaders of our political and\r\n     economic life, as he should do considering the fateful time through\r\n     which the Empire is passing.\r\n\r\n     \"If the Chancellor is to succeed in carrying through the huge tasks\r\n     still before him, it is, in my opinion, imperative that he should\r\n     not lose touch with Conservative circles, and I think there is no\r\n     reason why the Kaiser should not ask men like Herr v. Wangenheim,\r\n     Count Schwerin-Löwitz, etc., to visit him from time to time at\r\n     headquarters, and to acquaint him with their wishes and anxieties.\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot help telling you that the whole nation views with\r\n     profound regret the Kaiser's isolation. Since the outbreak of the\r\n     war I have only once had an interview with His Excellency v.\r\n     Falkenhayn, and the main purpose of my asking for it was to request\r\n     him to bring about a change in this state of things by using his\r\n     influence with the Kaiser. His Excellency frankly told me that he\r\n     had some objections to doing this, but he promised me nevertheless\r\n     that he would exercise his influence in this direction. I am only\r\n     afraid that, because of the excessive burden of work he has to get\r\n     through, the matter has slipped his memory....\"\r\n\r\nBallin was not the only one who, as early as 1916, regarded with such\r\nalarm the devastating effects of a possible entry of the United States\r\ninto the war; other men of political training thought so too, although\r\ntheir number was not large. The following passages, taken from two\r\nletters which Ballin received from a member of the German diplomatic\r\nservice, show that the feeling was there:\r\n\r\n     \"February 16th, 1916. My chief apprehensions are purely political.\r\n     Although it seems that for the moment our differences with the\r\n     United States will be smoothed over, there can be no doubt but that\r\n     at times the tension has been so great that a wrong move at the\r\n     critical moment would have caused America to take up arms against\r\n     us. Contrary to what most people seem to think, I regard this\r\n     danger as having by no means passed; in fact I look upon it as\r\n     always lurking in the background. Those who, like myself, have seen\r\n     that the secret ideal of British policy is an alliance and\r\n     permanent co-operation with America, will agree with me that such\r\n     an Anglo-American understanding for the period of this war would be\r\n     of lasting detriment to our whole future. You know England, and you\r\n     know that the course of events has turned the Entente automatically\r\n     into an alliance, although the British, especially those who look\r\n     beyond the actual present, have always felt a great deal of\r\n     aversion towards such a development. The individual Frenchman,\r\n     indeed, is mostly looked upon as a somewhat grotesque and slightly\r\n     ludicrous character, but all the same there exists some sympathy\r\n     with the French as a nation, however artificially this may have\r\n     been brought about; but towards Russia the average Englishman never\r\n     felt anything but an icy aloofness and a great deal of antipathy.\r\n     Hence, the so-called allies of the British have never been the\r\n     cause of unalloyed joy to them.\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand, to establish permanent relations with that part\r\n     of the Anglo-Saxon race inhabiting the huge continent across the\r\n     Atlantic has at all times been the aim pursued by every really\r\n     far-sighted British statesman. By means of such an alliance, it is\r\n     hoped to consolidate and to strengthen for many generations the\r\n     foundations on which the venerable but also slightly dilapidated\r\n     structure of the United Kingdom rests. From a purely maritime point\r\n     of view, such an alliance would be of overwhelming strength. In my\r\n     opinion it would be perfectly hopeless for our country, constantly\r\n     menaced as it is by serious Continental complications, to gain the\r\n     trident of Neptune in opposition to these two Powers. I believe an\r\n     Anglo-American league, whose object it would be to prevent us from\r\n     becoming a commercial, naval, and Continental Power, would\r\n     restrict us once more to a purely Continental policy, a policy\r\n     which we have so successfully discarded since the accession of our\r\n     present Kaiser.\r\n\r\n     \"To frustrate such an alliance must be our principal task. To call\r\n     it into being or even to facilitate its conclusion would be the\r\n     greatest crime against Germany's future which anyone could commit.\r\n\r\n     \"Let us by all means sink as much enemy tonnage as possible, let us\r\n     lay mines, and let us proceed with our submarine warfare as\r\n     hitherto, or even with more energy, but let the people who are at\r\n     the head of the whole movement be aware of the immense\r\n     responsibility that rests on their shoulders. If our leading men\r\n     speak of a war with America just as cheerfully as though San Marino\r\n     or Montenegro were involved, I cannot help viewing such an attitude\r\n     with the utmost apprehension. The British will use all their\r\n     astuteness and all their energy to exploit any mistakes committed\r\n     by Germany. If they succeed in this, and if, in consequence, our\r\n     relations with the United States become very strained again or\r\n     drift towards a rupture, I fear that we shall not be able to bring\r\n     this war to a successful close, or derive from it any security for\r\n     our future development.\r\n\r\n     \"Berlin, February 26th, 1916. During the two days I have now been\r\n     here it has greatly depressed me to see a number of fanatics who\r\n     cannot gauge the consequences of their doings attempting to drive\r\n     this splendid German people towards a new abyss. Alas! delusions\r\n     and folly are rampant everywhere. If I were you, I should now\r\n     disregard every other consideration, and explain to the Kaiser as a\r\n     friend that everything is being gambled away: the existence of his\r\n     Empire, his crown, and possibly the fate of the dynasty. It is like\r\n     living in a madhouse; everyone talks about war with Holland,\r\n     America, Denmark and Roumania as though a mere picnic were\r\n     concerned.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the war Ballin tried over and over again to make the responsible\r\nauthorities see the position in the same light as his own observations,\r\nand his repeated discussions with unprejudiced and clear-headed men had\r\nled him to see it himself. The letter reproduced below contains a\r\ndescription of the general situation at the time of writing (July,\r\n1916). It was addressed to a friend of his in the diplomatic service who\r\nwas looking after German interests in one of the countries allied with\r\nGermany, and who had asked him for some information concerning the\r\nsituation at home:\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry that I can send you no good news at all. The conduct of\r\n     the war and its probable outcome are more of a mystery now than\r\n     ever, and with all that I cannot help feeling that our responsible\r\n     quarters do not even now realize the profound gravity of the\r\n     situation. The political and the military leaders are frequently at\r\n     variance. There is a lack of proper co-operation between Berlin and\r\n     Vienna. We imagine ourselves to be the rider, but we are only the\r\n     horse. The road between Berlin and Vienna is studded with\r\n     compromises of doubtful value, and incapable archdukes are given\r\n     the most important positions.\r\n\r\n     \"The military situation was favourable until the Austrians thought\r\n     their day of reckoning with Italy had come, and when our own\r\n     Supreme Command set out to cover themselves with laurels in France.\r\n\r\n     \"Both these undertakings turned out to be political and military\r\n     failures. For hundreds of reasons an early peace is imperative to\r\n     us. As matters stand at present only Great Britain and Russia can\r\n     conclude peace, because France and Italy must be regarded as mere\r\n     British vassals.\r\n\r\n     \"Since the Cabinets of London and Petrograd remain absolutely deaf\r\n     to our publicly expressed overtures for peace, we have no choice\r\n     but to try to utterly defeat the one or the other of these, our\r\n     principal enemies, either Russia or Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"We could have finished with Great Britain if we had had at least\r\n     300 first-class submarines, and in that case we might have regarded\r\n     a war against America with complacency.\r\n\r\n     \"However, even if we possessed, as some optimists believe, as many\r\n     as 150 first-class submarines, we could not strike a mortal blow at\r\n     Great Britain and defy the United States as well. Therefore, we\r\n     have only one choice left: we must force Russia, our second chief\r\n     enemy, to her knees.\r\n\r\n     \"Russia has been badly hit through the loss of the industrial\r\n     regions of Poland. If we had exerted all our strength in that\r\n     direction, and if we had taken Kiev, the economic key to Russia,\r\n     the Tsar would have had no alternative but to conclude a separate\r\n     peace, and this would have settled the Roumanian question at the\r\n     same time.\r\n\r\n     \"With less certainty, but also, perhaps, with less exertion, it\r\n     might have proved possible to make peace _via_ Petrograd. But what\r\n     have we done instead? We have squandered our forces. The Eastern\r\n     theatre of war was denuded of troops, because at first Falkenhayn\r\n     felt sure he could take Verdun in a fortnight, then by Easter, and\r\n     finally by Whitsuntide. All our forces have been hurled at Verdun;\r\n     rivers of blood have been spilt, and now, in July, we are still\r\n     outside it. And what does it profit us if we do get it? We shall\r\n     only find other and more formidable lines behind it.\r\n\r\n     \"In the meantime our good Austrians have transferred all their\r\n     reliable officers and men to the Tyrol, and have left nothing but\r\n     the rubbish and their inefficient generals to guard the points of\r\n     danger. And what are the results? A graceful retirement for\r\n     Salandra and the formation of an anti-German coalition government\r\n     in Italy on the one hand, and a manifestation of Austrian\r\n     superiority on the other, but a failure, nevertheless, because the\r\n     Austrians were not strong enough numerically to get down into the\r\n     plain. And even if they had compelled the evacuation of Venetia\r\n     nothing would have been gained. The fate of Italy, as it happens,\r\n     does not depend on Austria, but on Great Britain, who will rather\r\n     watch her starve and perish for want of coal than permit her to sue\r\n     for peace.\r\n\r\n     \"Although all this is perfectly plain to everyone, our Supreme\r\n     Command seems to be undecided as to whether an offensive with all\r\n     the means at our disposal should be started on the Western Front\r\n     simultaneously with one against Russia, or whether it should be\r\n     directed against Russia only. As far back as last year I exerted\r\n     all my influence--small though it has become--in favour of an\r\n     energetic and whole-hearted offensive against Russia.\r\n\r\n     \"Well-informed and far-seeing men have justly pointed out that, if\r\n     fortune so wills it, the Kaiser, arm in arm with Hindenburg and\r\n     Ludendorff, could risk a 'bad peace' without danger to himself and\r\n     his dynasty, but it appears beyond doubt that the influence of\r\n     Falkenhayn is all-powerful.\r\n\r\n     \" ... If we were to arrive at an understanding with Russia to-day,\r\n     we should be able to go on with the war against Great Britain for a\r\n     long time to come, and, by means of unimpeded submarine activity,\r\n     to carry it to a successful issue. In that case we could also\r\n     estimate the danger threatening us from America at as low a figure\r\n     as many who are unacquainted with the position are putting it now.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus it is my view that it is necessary to abandon definitely the\r\n     belief that the war can be brought to a successful issue on the\r\n     Western Front, and without first defeating Russia. It is greatly to\r\n     be deplored that many observers assert that the Western Powers will\r\n     make peace when they have found out that the big offensive now in\r\n     progress remains without any visible success. Only people who do\r\n     not know Great Britain can put forward such a proposition, but how\r\n     many people are there at the Wilhelmstrasse who do know Great\r\n     Britain? Very few indeed, if any....\r\n\r\n     \" ... You said you would rejoice to hear from me, and I can only\r\n     regret with all my heart that I have not been able to report\r\n     anything to you in which it would really be possible to rejoice.\"\r\n\r\nA still more serious note is struck in the following letter written in\r\nSeptember, 1916:\r\n\r\n     \"Very many thanks for your welcome letter of yesterday's date, with\r\n     the contents of which I agree in every detail.\r\n\r\n     \"I quite share your belief that Hindenburg and Ludendorff must each\r\n     feel like a great physician who is only called in when it is too\r\n     late. Two declarations of war within 24 hours were necessary to\r\n     bring about this change which the German people had been looking\r\n     forward to for months and months. The Chancellor is justly\r\n     reproached for not having had the courage to insist upon the\r\n     appointment of these two men and on the resignation of Falkenhayn\r\n     long ago. It is contended that he should have tendered his own\r\n     resignation if his recommendations were refused, and his neglect to\r\n     do so makes him principally responsible for the fate that is in\r\n     store for us. For a long time back I have kept emphasizing the need\r\n     for transferring our main activities to the Eastern theatre of war,\r\n     and for definitely settling these personal questions.\r\n\r\n     \"The Chancellor clings to his post because he believes that there\r\n     is no one better qualified than himself to be at the head of\r\n     affairs. Such an attitude reminds me of the old gentleman who\r\n     neither wanted to die nor to retire from his post as president of\r\n     the Berlin Chamber of Commerce, and who bitterly complained to\r\n     those who came to congratulate him on his ninetieth birthday that\r\n     he was compelled to stick to his office, in spite of his advanced\r\n     years, because he could not see a better man to succeed him.\r\n\r\n     \"It is very sad that we have arrived at such an _impasse_, and I am\r\n     convinced that the present internal political situation is\r\n     untenable. No German Chancellor can possibly carry the business of\r\n     the country to a successful issue if, in the midst of a terrible\r\n     war, he is obliged to fight against an opposition consisting of the\r\n     Conservatives, the representatives of the Heavy Industries, and the\r\n     majority of the National Liberals.\r\n\r\n     \"As far as I can make out, the Chinese wall surrounding the Kaiser\r\n     has not disappeared with the exit of Falkenhayn from the scene. No\r\n     one is granted access to him who knows something about the events\r\n     that led up to this war, and who, in the interests of his dynasty\r\n     as well as his own, would tell him the unvarnished truth. We are,\r\n     after all, a constitutional country. It would doubtless be best to\r\n     transfer General Headquarters to Berlin, but, of course, people are\r\n     not wanting who object to such a proceeding, asserting that it\r\n     would enable outside influences to acquire a hold on the conduct of\r\n     affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"How badly people are informed with regard to the actual situation\r\n     was brought home to me when I was in Berlin a short while ago, and\r\n     when X. contended with great emphasis that we should have to attach\r\n     more value to huge indemnities than to annexations. If it is\r\n     possible that the men round the Kaiser count on heavy indemnities\r\n     even now, it shows how sadly they misjudge the real state of\r\n     affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"My feeling tells me that the present Cabinets, containing as they\r\n     do men who are compromised by their actions since the outbreak of\r\n     war, cannot give us peace. How can anyone imagine that men like\r\n     Bethmann, Asquith and Grey, who have hurled such incredible insults\r\n     at each other, can ever sit together at the same table?\r\n\r\n     \"The question as to who is to succeed them, of course, abounds with\r\n     difficulties.\r\n\r\n     \"I recently met some Austrian gentlemen in Berlin. They are\r\n     completely apathetic; they have lost all interest in the future,\r\n     and they themselves suggest that Germany should no longer permit\r\n     Austria to have a voice in the conduct of affairs. Her food supply\r\n     will only last until March 1st. After that date she will depend on\r\n     Hungary and ourselves for her food. She fears that she is not\r\n     likely to get much, if anything, from Hungary; on the other hand,\r\n     she feels sure that we are compelled for our own sake to save her\r\n     from famine.\r\n\r\n     \"Constantinople, too, has only supplies for a few more weeks.\r\n\r\n     \"With us at home the paraffin question is becoming very serious. In\r\n     country districts it may be possible to tell people to go to bed at\r\n     curfew time, but the working population of our large cities will\r\n     never consent to dispense with artificial light. Serious riots have\r\n     already taken place in connexion with the fat shortage.\r\n\r\n     \"I am afraid that Great Britain is trying to bring about such a\r\n     change in the situation as will enable her shortly to tell the\r\n     small neutral countries that no one in Europe will be permitted any\r\n     longer to remain neutral, and that they must make up their minds to\r\n     enter one or the other of the two big syndicates. You see nothing I\r\n     can write to you has even a semblance of comfort in it. I regard\r\n     the future with the utmost apprehension.\"\r\n\r\nIn contrast to such views as were expressed in the foregoing letters,\r\nthe men who were at the head of affairs at that time maintained that\r\nnothing but the application of rigorous force, or, in other words, the\r\nunrestricted use of the submarine weapon against Great Britain, would\r\nlead to a successful termination of the world war. The propaganda in\r\nfavour of that measure is still in everybody's memory. Whatever may be\r\nsaid in defence of the authors of this propaganda, there is one reproach\r\nfrom which they cannot escape, viz. that they left no stone unturned to\r\nprevent their opponents from stating their views, and this, on account\r\nof the strict censorship to which the expression of every independent\r\nopinion was subject, was not a difficult matter. Their one-sided policy\r\nwent so far that, when a pamphlet on the question of submarine warfare\r\nwas written by order of the Admiralty Staff and circulated among a\r\nnumber of persons, including leading shipping men, Ballin was purposely\r\nexcluded, because it was taken for granted that he would not express\r\nhimself in favour of the contents. It is not likely, however, that the\r\nmethods of reasoning put forward in this document--which was much more\r\nlike an academic dissertation than an unprejudiced criticism of a\r\npolitical and military measure affecting the whole national existence of\r\nGermany--would have induced Ballin to change his views on the submarine\r\nwar. Once only, and then merely for a brief period, was he in doubt as\r\nto whether his views on that question were right, but he soon returned\r\nto his first opinion when he found that he had been misinformed\r\nregarding the number and the effectiveness of submarines available.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of unrestricted submarine warfare in January, 1917, not\r\nonly put a sudden end to the peace movement in which Ballin, as has been\r\nexplained on a preceding page, played an important part, but also to the\r\nattempt of President Wilson to bring the two sides together. The details\r\nof the President's endeavours have meanwhile become public property\r\nthrough the revelations of Count Bernstorff, the German ambassador in\r\nWashington. In both instances a few weeks would have sufficed to\r\nascertain whether the proposed action was likely to bring about the\r\ndesired end, and the former attempt had even led to the impending\r\nestablishment of mutual contact between the belligerents. The inability\r\nof the German political leaders to avail themselves of this opportunity,\r\nor at least their failure to do so, has doubtless been the greatest\r\nmisfortune from which Germany had to suffer during the whole war.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the successful exploits of the submarines, Ballin's\r\napprehensions never left him, and they were not allayed by the\r\ndevelopment of the position at home. The letter published below, which\r\nhe wrote to the Chief of the Kaiser's Civil Cabinet, believing that this\r\ngentleman would be most likely to assist him in laying his views before\r\nthe Kaiser, admirably sums up his feelings, and testifies both to his\r\nreal patriotism and to his presentiment of the fate that was to overtake\r\nhis country:\r\n\r\n     \"YOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\n\"_April 4th, 1917_.\r\n\r\n     The internal conditions of our country fill me with grave alarm,\r\n     and I therefore venture to approach Your Excellency privately with\r\n     this expression of my apprehensions.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not doubt for a moment that our competent authorities intend\r\n     to extract the utmost advantage to ourselves from the situation\r\n     which is developing in Russia. This Russian revolution may enable\r\n     us to bring the war to a close, and to obtain peace terms which,\r\n     relatively speaking, are not unfavourable.\r\n\r\n     \"What Germany has achieved in this war is beyond all praise. A\r\n     glance at the map shows how small she is compared with her\r\n     opponents in the field; and yet she is bravely struggling against a\r\n     world in arms in which even the few countries that have remained\r\n     neutral are not our friends. It is, indeed, one grand epic. But\r\n     unfortunately the position at home becomes more untenable every\r\n     day.\r\n\r\n     \"If we find ourselves compelled to reduce the bread ration still\r\n     more, you will, I am sure, agree with me that the bulk of the\r\n     people will suffer enormously through being underfed. In Austria,\r\n     conditions are said to be worse still, and I am afraid that we\r\n     shall even have to part with some of our stores to feed her\r\n     population.\r\n\r\n     \"At first sight the Chancellor's speech in the Prussian House of\r\n     Deputies appeared to be somewhat too comprehensive in its range of\r\n     vision; but a few days later, when the news of the Russian\r\n     revolution arrived, it almost seemed that his words had been\r\n     prompted by Divine inspiration. After this Russian news had become\r\n     known, it would have been impossible for him to make this speech\r\n     without giving rise to the suspicion that these events had cast\r\n     their shadow in advance on the Prussian Parliament. Unfortunately,\r\n     however, this favourable development was not followed up by the\r\n     right steps. On the contrary, the Chancellor, after his breezy\r\n     advance in the House of Deputies, has now retired from the position\r\n     he then took up, thus creating the impression that our policy is\r\n     constantly shaped by all sorts of mutually contradictory views and\r\n     currents. Up to now, although the people have to suffer greatly\r\n     through the shortage of food and fuel, their patriotism has put up\r\n     with it because of their faith in the promised electoral reforms.\r\n     It would have been so simple to reiterate this promise, and at the\r\n     same time to point out that so many other things claimed precedence\r\n     during the war, and that so much was at stake, that it would hardly\r\n     be advisable to introduce this great reform at present, seeing that\r\n     there was no time to give proper attention to the careful working\r\n     out of all the details.\r\n\r\n     \"If now, however, such bills as those dealing with the entailed\r\n     property legislation and with the repeal of the Polish laws are to\r\n     be discussed, such a postponement is no longer justifiable.\r\n\r\n     \"It almost seems as if the Government is unable to read the signs\r\n     of the times. The fate of the Prussian suffrage reform bids fair to\r\n     resemble that of the sibylline books, of which it was said that\r\n     the longer one hesitated to buy them the more expensive they\r\n     became. To-day the people would still be content to agree to plural\r\n     voting, but when the war is over, and when the Socialist leaders\r\n     are demobilizing their men, inducing tens of thousands of them,\r\n     decorated with the Iron Cross, to air their grievances, it will be\r\n     too late to stop the ball from rolling. It is true that people say\r\n     revolutions are impossible in the era of the machine-gun. I have no\r\n     faith in this theory, especially since the events that have\r\n     happened in Petrograd have become known to us. That, in a country\r\n     like Russia, the reigning family could disappear from the scene\r\n     without any opposition, and without a single Grand Duke or a single\r\n     soldier attempting to prevent it, is certainly food for much\r\n     reflection.\r\n\r\n     \"I hope Your Excellency will pardon me for thus frankly expressing\r\n     my anxieties, but I considered it my duty to let Your Excellency\r\n     know my feelings.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1917, Ballin accepted an invitation received from the Supreme\r\nArmy Command and paid a visit to General Headquarters, where he found a\r\ngreat deal of discontent prevailing with the policy of the Chancellor.\r\nHe also met the Kaiser, and reports on his visit as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"After sharing the Kaiser's repast--which was plain and on a war\r\n     diet--I had several hours' private conversation with His Majesty. I\r\n     found him full of optimism, far more so than I thought was\r\n     justified. Both he and Ludendorff seem to put too much faith in the\r\n     success of the submarines; but they fail to see that this weapon is\r\n     procuring for us the enmity of the whole world, and that the\r\n     promise held out by its advocates, viz., that Great Britain will be\r\n     brought to her knees within two months, is, to put it mildly,\r\n     extremely doubtful of realization, unless we can sink the ships\r\n     which carry ammunition and pit-props to England.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to a gentleman in the Kaiser's entourage he gave a\r\nfurther detailed account of his views on the optimism prevailing in high\r\nplaces:\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot help thinking of the enthusiastic and at the same time\r\n     highly optimistic letter which you had the great kindness to show\r\n     me last night. My opinion is that the gentlemen who form the\r\n     entourage of His Majesty ought not to view matters as that\r\n     interesting epistle suggests that they do.\r\n\r\n     \"You are a believer in the statistics of Mr. X. I took the liberty\r\n     of telling you last night that statistics are a mathematical form\r\n     of telling a lie, and that, to use the expression of a clever\r\n     Frenchman, a statistical table is like a loose woman who is at the\r\n     service of anyone who wants her. 'There are different ways of\r\n     arranging figures,' as they say in England. I do not know Mr. X,\r\n     neither do I know his statistics, but what I have been told about\r\n     them seemed foolish to me. If we carry on the war, and particularly\r\n     the unrestricted submarine war, on the basis of statistics such as\r\n     he and other jugglers with figures have compiled, we are sure to\r\n     fail in the ends we are aiming at.\r\n\r\n     \"As concerns the unrestricted submarine war itself, I still\r\n     maintain the view I have always held, viz., that we shall never\r\n     succeed in starving out Great Britain to such an extent as to force\r\n     her Government to sue for a peace of our dictation.\r\n\r\n     \"I have just had a visit from a Danish friend whom His Majesty also\r\n     knows quite well, and who, together with a committee of delegates\r\n     sent by the Danish Government, will be leaving for England\r\n     to-night. The two members of this committee who represent the\r\n     Ministry of Agriculture have been instructed, _inter alia_, to\r\n     complain that Great Britain now imports much less bacon, butter,\r\n     and other articles from Denmark than she had undertaken to do, and\r\n     that the prices she pays for these imports are much below those\r\n     originally stipulated.\r\n\r\n     \"Apart from the cargo carried by two small steamers that have been\r\n     torpedoed, Denmark has been able, notwithstanding our submarines,\r\n     to supply Great Britain with all the food required of her. The\r\n     vessels remain in territorial waters until a wireless message\r\n     informs them of the spot where they will meet the British convoy\r\n     which is to take them safely to England. They have to pass through\r\n     only a small danger zone which, as I have said, has hitherto proved\r\n     fatal to no more than two vessels.\r\n\r\n     \"This fact, to my mind, points to the limits of the success\r\n     obtainable by our submarines. I have constantly explained,\r\n     especially to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff, that I can only\r\n     regard the submarine as a successful weapon if it enables us to cut\r\n     off the British supplies of ore from Spain and Sweden, and also\r\n     those of pit-props, because without the possession of these two\r\n     necessities, Great Britain is no longer able to continue the war. I\r\n     have been assured that our submarines would achieve this task, even\r\n     if torpedo boats were employed as convoys; but the experiences\r\n     gained so far do not bear out these predictions. We succeed,\r\n     indeed, in sinking a few vessels out of many; but suppose there are\r\n     ten ships in a convoy, it still means that nine of them, with their\r\n     supplies of ore and pit-props, safely reach their destination.\r\n\r\n     \"Let me repeat, the starvation of Great Britain is impossible;\r\n     because, in addition to her own harvests, she only needs from\r\n     twelve to fifteen thousand tons of cereals every day, and these she\r\n     can, if necessary, always obtain at night-time through her Channel\r\n     service, _via_ Spain and France. Even this necessity will hardly\r\n     arise, because two medium-sized steamers are sufficient to carry\r\n     the fifteen thousand tons, and things would have to be very bad,\r\n     indeed, if these did not succeed in reaching a British port. And if\r\n     our statistical tricksters juggle with crop failures, please do not\r\n     forget that new harvests are soon to be expected, and that it will\r\n     not do always to count on crop failures.\r\n\r\n     \"You will be doing a good work if you can persuade people at\r\n     headquarters to abandon their belief that Great Britain can be\r\n     starved to submission. Unfortunately their other belief, viz., that\r\n     we can cut off her supplies of ore and pit-props, will also have to\r\n     be abandoned.\r\n\r\n     \"Certainly, the achievements of our submarines have been amazing.\r\n     At their present rate they will enormously diminish the British\r\n     tonnage figures, and raise the hatred of everything German to\r\n     boiling point; but they will not, unfortunately, lead to such an\r\n     end of the war as our Pan-Germans desire. It is a thousand pities!\r\n\r\n     \"When the submarine problem began to assume practical shape, I\r\n     pointed out to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff that, to be\r\n     successful, the submarine war must be brief; that its principal\r\n     object was not to sink a large number of ships, but to produce such\r\n     a feeling of alarm in neutral countries as to prevent them from\r\n     risking their ships (1) because of the great value of tonnage\r\n     immediately after the war, (2) because of the impossibility of\r\n     finding crews, and (3) because of the insurance difficulty. These\r\n     conditions of success were, indeed, realized during the first four\r\n     weeks; but since that time people, as I had predicted, have got\r\n     used to the danger. The crews are coming forth again, the insurance\r\n     companies issue their policies again, and the ships are put to sea\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     \"If the Admiralty Staff, who is doubtless in possession of the\r\n     figures, would submit to you a list of the number of vessels laid\r\n     up in Dutch and Scandinavian ports on March 1st, owing to the\r\n     submarine danger, and another one showing the position as it is\r\n     to-day, you would discover that, at a low estimate, at least 30 per\r\n     cent, of the cargo vessels are running again, and that, after\r\n     another month or so, the number of those still idle will have\r\n     dwindled down to 20 per cent, or less.\r\n\r\n     \"These are my views on the situation. If we have no other means of\r\n     finishing the war but the submarine menace, it will go on for\r\n     years. I should like to protest in anticipation against any\r\n     suggestion to the effect that I am trying to minimize the\r\n     achievements of the submarines. On the contrary, I have nothing but\r\n     the highest admiration for them, and I really find it quite\r\n     impossible to praise in ordinary prose all that our country has\r\n     done during this war; the whole achievement is one grand epic.\r\n\r\n     \"Within the next few months the problem will have to be solved how\r\n     to put an end to this devastating catastrophe which is ruining the\r\n     progress of the world. There is no need for me to tell you that the\r\n     position of Germany has grown considerably worse through the active\r\n     intervention of the United States. The fact that this enormously\r\n     wealthy country with its one hundred million inhabitants has turned\r\n     against us is fraught with the most dangerous consequences. Now it\r\n     will no longer be possible for us to continue the war for several\r\n     more years, and then to enforce a peace on lines such as are laid\r\n     down by a noisy section of our people, unless we succeed in\r\n     exploiting the extremely fortunate change in the Russian situation\r\n     in such a way that the vast resources of that country will be at\r\n     our disposal.\r\n\r\n     \"This letter has become longer than it ought to be, but the gravity\r\n     of the subject with which it deals must be my excuse for going into\r\n     so many details. Perhaps I may avail myself of some future occasion\r\n     to acquaint you with my hopes and fears on other political matters;\r\n     because, as I have already explained, the present state of affairs\r\n     makes it urgently desirable that the gentlemen whose privilege it\r\n     is to be near His Majesty should see things as they really are, and\r\n     not as they would wish them to be.\r\n\r\n     \"Compare, if you have a chance, the advertisement pages of an\r\n     English paper with those of a German one. I have just come across a\r\n     copy of the _Daily Telegraph_ which I beg to enclose for this\r\n     purpose. I have been in the habit of studying these advertisements\r\n     for many months; they are excellent means of gauging the difference\r\n     in the effects of the war on the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the remaining part of 1917, and during the first months of 1918\r\nas well, Ballin took an active interest in the preparations for the Bill\r\ndealing with the rebuilding of the German mercantile marine; in other\r\nrespects, especially with regard to political matters, the course of\r\nevents condemned him to remain passive. His notes during this period are\r\nfew. I select the following passages from them:\r\n\r\n     \" ... July 17th, 1917. The Erzberger resolution which was chiefly\r\n     aimed at Helfferich and the naval authorities has made the\r\n     Chancellor's position untenable. Everybody turned against Herr von\r\n     Bethmann, and General von Ludendorff informed me by telephone that\r\n     he would resign if Bethmann remained in office.\r\n\r\n     \"I then had a lengthy talk with His Excellency v. Valentini who\r\n     agreed that it was necessary for the Chancellor to retire; but he\r\n     found it just as difficult as other people to name a suitable\r\n     successor. Vienna had raised strong objections to the appointment\r\n     of Prince Bülow, and, acting upon Valentini's suggestion, I made\r\n     up my mind to approach the Kaiser with a view to discussing with\r\n     him the situation which appeared to me fraught with the greatest\r\n     danger. I therefore asked His Excellency von Reischach to arrange\r\n     such a meeting for me, but on Thursday night I was rung up from\r\n     headquarters and informed that Hindenburg and Ludendorff were\r\n     already on their way to the Kaiser to report to His Majesty on this\r\n     subject. Under these circumstances I did not like to interfere, and\r\n     on Friday I withdrew my application for an interview. The Kaiser\r\n     has told the two generals that he had accepted Bethmann's\r\n     resignation the previous evening. He is thus able to save himself\r\n     from a perplexing situation by contending that he had to give in to\r\n     the wishes of the Supreme Army Command.\r\n\r\n     \" ... July 25th, 1917. Yesterday I called on Prince Bülow at his\r\n     Flottbek residence, and found him looking better than I had seen\r\n     him for years. After I had left him I had the feeling that the\r\n     Prince, who regards the whole situation with a great deal of\r\n     misgiving, would even be willing to accept the post of Foreign\r\n     Secretary under Michaelis himself, in order to be able to guide our\r\n     foreign policy along sensible lines once more. Contrary to the\r\n     reserve which he formerly showed, he now condemns Bethmann's policy\r\n     with great bitterness. Bethmann, he maintains, by yielding to the\r\n     demand for universal suffrage, acted like a banker on the day\r\n     before bankruptcy who would try to save himself from disaster by\r\n     using his clients' deposits.\r\n\r\n     \"The Mexico telegram[5] he treated with a good deal of sarcasm,\r\n     remarking that it was the maddest prank since the exploits of the\r\n     Captain of Köpenick, with which I agreed. If anyone, he said, ever\r\n     wrote a comedy on the subject, he would scarcely venture to lay the\r\n     plot in modern times, but would go back to the period when pigtails\r\n     and wigs were the fashion.\r\n\r\n     \" ... July 30th, 1917. I had several messages over the telephone,\r\n     as well as a visit, from Lieutenant-Colonel von Voss, the Chief of\r\n     Staff with the Altona Army Command, who wanted to consult me as to\r\n     whether Prince Bülow should be offered the post of Foreign\r\n     Secretary. I am afraid, however, that there is not much chance of\r\n     his being appointed. The Prince shares this opinion, and would not\r\n     like the Press to make any propaganda in his favour.\r\n\r\n     \" ... Sept. 14th, 1917. In the meantime, on August 19th, the Kaiser\r\n     has been to Hamburg on a one day's visit. He came from Heligoland,\r\n     and was brimful of optimism.\r\n\r\n     \"He pretended to be very well satisfied with his new Chancellor,\r\n     and was very optimistic as to a German victory, an attitude which,\r\n     I am afraid, is not in the least justified by the situation as it\r\n     is.\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1917, Ballin wrote a memorandum for Dr.\r\nSchwander, the newly appointed Secretary of State for National Economy.\r\nApart from politics this document deals with economic matters, and in\r\nparticular with the legislation concerning these during the period of\r\ntransition which would succeed the close of the war. Ballin gave a great\r\ndeal of thought to these questions, and I shall refer to them later on.\r\nMeanwhile I will quote the text of the memorandum:\r\n\r\n_\"September 6th, 1917._\r\n\r\n     \"The fall of Riga shows once more how far superior our military\r\n     achievements are to the work performed by our politicians. With the\r\n     dispatch of the Mexico telegram their folly appeared to me to have\r\n     reached its height; but the descent from that point is but slow.\r\n     The news recently published by the Press to the effect that the\r\n     Federal Council is to deal with the question of the constitutional\r\n     and administrative reforms which are to be granted to\r\n     Alsace-Lorraine, makes me fear that some big political blunder is\r\n     going to be committed again. It is evidently believed that, if\r\n     Alsace-Lorraine were to be established as an independent federal\r\n     state with perhaps some South German prince as its Grand Duke, such\r\n     a measure would remove an obstacle to peace. I, however, consider\r\n     it a great tactical mistake to attempt such a solution of the\r\n     Alsace-Lorraine problem before the war is over. We must never lose\r\n     sight of the fact that each one of the leading actors in the\r\n     political drama has to play to his own gallery, and that therefore\r\n     at the conclusion of peace--which in my opinion can only be one of\r\n     compromise--French diplomacy must be able to show up something\r\n     which the man in the street can be induced to regard as a _succès\r\n     d'estime_. No doubt it would be easier and more to our liking to\r\n     solve the problem in our own way, and at the initiative of our\r\n     Government; but by doing so we would deprive ourselves of another\r\n     possibility for compromising which we ought to keep in order to\r\n     enable the French to retire from the struggle with a fair measure\r\n     of success.\r\n\r\n     \"We have a bad habit of spoiling the chances of peace by premature\r\n     actions intended to help it on and to prepare the way for it. Just\r\n     think of what we did in Poland! In the same way we deliberately\r\n     diminished the great value of the important asset which we possess\r\n     in the shape of Belgium when we set up the Council of Flanders and\r\n     introduced the administrative partition of that country.\r\n\r\n     \"Besides these political matters there are others which were better\r\n     left alone for the present. I am thinking of the steps taken to\r\n     regulate our economic restoration after the war. War corporations\r\n     are springing from the ground like mushrooms after rain, and the\r\n     preparations made in order to solve the difficult economic post-war\r\n     problems have an ugly tendency toward establishing too many\r\n     Government-controlled organizations. To my mind the appointment of\r\n     a 'Government Commissioner for the period of Economic Transition'\r\n     is altogether superfluous. We must refrain from all attempts at\r\n     interfering by artificial means with the natural development of\r\n     events. This, however, is precisely what the Commissioner would\r\n     have to do. He would have to act according to instructions received\r\n     from the Bank of Germany or from some specially created body\r\n     dealing with the question of the foreign exchanges and the\r\n     provision of foreign bills.\r\n\r\n     \"My belief is that our foreign exchanges which have so completely\r\n     got out of order will prove an excellent means of diminishing the\r\n     hatred against us and of making our enemies less disinclined to\r\n     resume business with us. The Americans who are now able to obtain\r\n     goods to the value of M 6.20 for their dollar, instead of M 4.20,\r\n     as they used to do, will soon discover their liking for us again.\r\n\r\n     \"Another point is that the coming peace, even if we derive no other\r\n     gain from it, will enormously raise German prestige all over the\r\n     world. Prussia became a European Power after the Seven Years' War,\r\n     in spite of the fact that the peace treaty brought her neither a\r\n     territorial nor a financial gain, merely confirming the right of\r\n     Frederick the Great to the possessions he had defended in the war.\r\n     Prestige, however, means credit, and this circumstance makes me\r\n     believe that all these anxious discussions of the foreign exchange\r\n     question and of the need for controlling German payments abroad are\r\n     just as superfluous as the Government control of our economic\r\n     activities during the period of transition.\r\n\r\n     \"The nations now at war will be impoverished after the war, and the\r\n     state of our exchange and the high prices of raw material will\r\n     compel us to live from hand to mouth as far as the importation of\r\n     raw material is concerned. Pending the return of normal conditions,\r\n     no sensible manufacturer will want to import more raw material than\r\n     he urgently requires.\r\n\r\n     \"I therefore think we ought to try to induce the Government to\r\n     desist from its proposed control of trade and industries, and to\r\n     restore the old conditions. If the Government's proposal to carry\r\n     on under its own management large sections of our import and export\r\n     trade--in order to make these valuable sources of profit available\r\n     for the reduction of its debts--were allowed to materialize, our\r\n     economic doom would be certain, however attractive the plan might\r\n     be in view of the huge national debt. One must be careful not to\r\n     ignore the fact that the flourishing state of trade and\r\n     manufactures is always largely due to the existence of personal\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\n     \"If I think of the lessons of the past forty years--a period during\r\n     which the freedom of trade, the freedom of industrial enterprise,\r\n     and the freedom of shipping have led to marvellous successes and to\r\n     the accumulation of huge wealth--I ask myself: 'How is it possible\r\n     that a wise statesman could seriously occupy himself with the plan\r\n     of establishing a Government-bound system in place of it?' How, I\r\n     ask you, can a State-managed industrial organization avail itself\r\n     of the advantages to be had when trade is booming, or to guard\r\n     itself against the losses when there is a slump? What will be the\r\n     attitude of such an organization towards dealings in futures and\r\n     speculation, both of which are indispensable forms of modern\r\n     business enterprise? True, it has been suggested that these\r\n     difficulties could be overcome if some business men were requested\r\n     to accept appointments under this system, and if so-called 'mixed'\r\n     concerns worked by the co-operation of public funds and private\r\n     capital were established. May Heaven grant that this will never be\r\n     done! I am sure you have had even more to do than I with business\r\n     men who had been promoted to the higher dignity of Government\r\n     officials. Most of them have turned out complete failures in their\r\n     new spheres; they have become more bureaucratic than our\r\n     bureaucrats themselves; their initiative and their eagerness to\r\n     take upon themselves responsibilities have never lasted very long.\r\n     Let there always be a fair field and no favour! Personal relations\r\n     and personal efficiency are all that we need for the rebuilding of\r\n     our national economic system. The 'mixed' concerns are bad because\r\n     they lack the necessary elasticity, because they disregard the\r\n     personal equation, and because they impede the indispensable\r\n     freedom of action.\r\n\r\n     \"I am quite prepared for these views of mine to meet with much\r\n     criticism. People will say: 'All that is very well, but the\r\n     Government's huge indebtedness compels it to take recourse to\r\n     extraordinary measures.' Quite right, but would it not be much\r\n     wiser to reduce this indebtedness by increasing direct and indirect\r\n     taxation, instead of depriving those who have proved during the\r\n     past few decades what they can do of the means that have made them\r\n     so efficient?\r\n\r\n     \"Even among the efficient business men, unless they be born\r\n     geniuses, a distinction must be drawn between those who can make\r\n     profits and those who can organize. The former kind--who are,\r\n     moreover, but few and far between--will never submit to the\r\n     personal restrictions to which they would be subjected in\r\n     state-managed or 'mixed' concerns. The second kind alone, however,\r\n     would never make any concern prosper.\r\n\r\n     \"Another consideration is that the enemy countries would view with\r\n     much suspicion any such institutions controlled partly or wholly\r\n     by the Government. I remember quite well the scant respect with\r\n     which the French delegates were treated at the International\r\n     Shipping Conferences before the war. Everyone knew that the big\r\n     French shipping companies, owing to the huge Government subsidies,\r\n     had to put up with a great deal of supervision on the part of the\r\n     Government, and that they could often vote neither for nor against\r\n     the most important proposals with which the Conference had to deal,\r\n     because they had first to obtain the consent of the Government\r\n     commissioner. They were, therefore, simply ignored, as it was clear\r\n     that they could raise no counter-proposals at their own initiative.\r\n\r\n     \"And truly there is every reason for us to use the utmost caution\r\n     whenever any questions connected with the reconstruction of our\r\n     country are concerned. The excellent Dr. Naumann, with his\r\n     'Berlin--Bagdad' slogan, has already smashed a good many window\r\n     panes which will have to be paid for after the war by the producing\r\n     classes. The suggestion that an economic union of the Central\r\n     European countries should be established was put forward at a most\r\n     inopportune moment, and the propaganda in its favour was bound to\r\n     bring about the retaliatory measures agreed upon by our enemies at\r\n     the Paris Economic Conference.\r\n\r\n     \"The resolutions of this Conference were of little practical\r\n     importance to us until the day when America entered the field\r\n     against us. If the United States assents to them, it will become\r\n     possible to enforce them, and for this reason I am watching the\r\n     further development of the economic question with growing concern.\r\n     I maintain that peace negotiations should only be started after a\r\n     previous agreement has been arrived at between the belligerents to\r\n     the effect that, on the conclusion of peace, the commercial\r\n     relations formerly existing between them should be restored as far\r\n     as possible, and that the resolutions passed at the Paris Economic\r\n     Conference and at the Central European Conference should be\r\n     rescinded. Such an attitude, however, can only be taken up by our\r\n     delegates if they agree that the former commercial treaties, no\r\n     matter whether they are still running or whether they have elapsed,\r\n     should automatically become valid again for a fairly extensive\r\n     period of time after the close of the war. The disadvantages which\r\n     some of these treaties involve for us are easily outbalanced by the\r\n     advantages secured by the others.\r\n\r\n     \"Our Government cannot be reminded too often that it is necessary\r\n     to consult experienced men of business in all such questions. Since\r\n     the early days of the war I have vainly tried to convince Herr v.\r\n     Bethmann of this necessity. After all, nobody can possibly be an\r\n     expert in everything. Yesterday, when reading the letters of Gustav\r\n     Freytag to his publisher, Mr. Hirzel, I came across the following\r\n     admirable piece of self-criticism: 'I do not know yet what is to\r\n     become of my work; but I fear I am doing what others, better\r\n     qualified than I, ought to be doing, and that I am leaving undone\r\n     what I ought to do.' Every great leader in our political and\r\n     economic life must have experienced that it is extremely\r\n     unsatisfactory to waste one's time and energy on work which another\r\n     man could do just as well as, or even better than, oneself. This\r\n     the Government should remember whenever it attempts to interfere\r\n     with the big industrial combines, such as trusts, syndicates, etc.\r\n     Wherever a syndicate is necessary in the best interests of any\r\n     industry, a leader will be forthcoming who will create it; and only\r\n     in cases where inferior minds, acting for selfish reasons of their\r\n     own, do not wish to acknowledge the need for combining, the\r\n     Government should be asked to exercise whatever pressure it\r\n     considers advisable in order to further the great aims that are\r\n     involved.\r\n\r\n     \"I am afraid that after the war we shall lack the funds needed for\r\n     the solution of the traffic problems with which we shall then be\r\n     confronted, especially with regard to our inland waterways. At any\r\n     rate, if we do build the necessary canals immediately after the\r\n     war, we shall find ourselves compelled to charge such high rates to\r\n     the vessels using these waterways that their advantages will\r\n     largely tend to become illusory. Even as it is now, our trade and\r\n     our manufactures are seriously handicapped by the high canal dues\r\n     existing, by the tugboat monopoly, etc. A really far-sighted policy\r\n     which would make it its principal object to assist the progress of\r\n     our foreign trade would have to guard against the mistaken idea\r\n     that the levying of high rates was the only means of obtaining\r\n     interest on the capital invested. After all, even the turnpikes had\r\n     to be abolished in the end.\r\n\r\n     \"The agitation in favour of separating from Russia the Ukraine,\r\n     Finland, and other parts inhabited by alien peoples--an agitation\r\n     which is becoming noisier every day--troubles me very much. Since\r\n     the early days of the war I have maintained that it must be our\r\n     main war aim to detach Russia from the Entente, and that we must\r\n     endeavour to establish close relations between our own country and\r\n     Russia so that the two of us shall be strong enough to face a\r\n     possible alliance between Great Britain, the United States, and\r\n     France. This should be our aim even now. But if we are going\r\n     deliberately to dismember the Russian Empire and to parcel it out\r\n     into a number of independent units, our political influence after\r\n     the war will be slight indeed, and the result must necessarily make\r\n     itself felt to the detriment of our whole economic life.\"\r\n\r\nAt Ballin's suggestion, the members of the Reichstag were invited to\r\nattend a meeting which was to be held in Hamburg during the summer of\r\n1918. Large sections of people in the three Hanseatic cities viewed with\r\ngrave concern the plans which the Government entertained for the\r\neconomic development after the war, and the meeting had been called to\r\ndraw the attention of the visitors to this state of affairs. Three\r\nprincipal speeches were delivered, and at the close of the meeting\r\nBallin briefly recapitulated the main arguments against too much\r\nGovernment interference. Much of what he said on that occasion, and much\r\nof what he had written in the memorandum quoted above, has been borne\r\nout by the events of the recent past, even though the actual terms of\r\nthe peace imposed on Germany were much more unfavourable than he had\r\nexpected them to be. In addressing himself to the Vice President of the\r\nReichstag, Geheimrat Dove, and the large number of the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the German people who accepted the invitation, Ballin\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"We should be glad if you would see to it that the Government does\r\n     not put a halter round our necks, and that it refrains from the\r\n     dangerous attempt to employ barrack-room methods where economic\r\n     questions of national and international importance are at stake.\r\n     Let us have air, and light, and freedom to act; and we, by availing\r\n     ourselves of our relations with the overseas countries, shall be\r\n     able to carry out the work that lies before us....\r\n\r\n     \" ... I am convinced that all the measures which are contemplated\r\n     to stabilize economic conditions during the period of transition\r\n     from war to peace will do more harm than good. If carried into\r\n     practice, they will merely prepare the soil for an economic\r\n     struggle to succeed the present war of arms. We need a peace that\r\n     is doubly secure! We cannot ask our enemies to give us freedom\r\n     where we impose compulsion. We cannot fight for the freedom of the\r\n     seas, and at the same time surround Central Europe with a barbed\r\n     wire.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not wish to deny that in order to carry out our economic\r\n     tasks a certain amount of Government control will be necessary.\r\n     That, of course, goes without saying; but anything beyond it is an\r\n     unmixed evil. If it is said to-day that the measures to be adopted\r\n     during the period of economic transition are, in some instances,\r\n     intended to remain in force for three years, and if it is announced\r\n     semi-officially that the thousand and one war corporations are to\r\n     be made use of for the purposes of this policy, and that their\r\n     disappearance is to be very gradual--I can only sound a serious\r\n     note of warning against any such designs. When the war is over all\r\n     those who can do efficient work will return to their normal\r\n     occupations; and those who then prefer to remain attached to the\r\n     war corporations in one capacity or other are surely to some extent\r\n     people who have discovered some hidden charms in these\r\n     institutions, or, if not, they are persons who, fearful of the\r\n     risks connected with the unfettered interplay of forces, feel that\r\n     they are better off under the protecting wing of the Government. If\r\n     you are going to entrust the future of our country to such\r\n     organizations for better or worse, the economic war after the war,\r\n     as I have said before, will be sure to follow, and you will have to\r\n     face a war that will last years and years.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the closing months of the war--which are also the closing\r\nmonths of Ballin's life--it must suffice to refer here to one event\r\nonly; one, however, which is of dramatic significance. I am speaking of\r\nBallin's last meeting with the Kaiser. His notes on this subject,\r\nroughly sketched though they are, require no further comment. I\r\nreproduce them in full:\r\n\r\n_\"Hamfelde, August 25th (Sunday), 1918._\r\n\r\n     \"Last Tuesday Herr Deters[6] rang me up to ask me on behalf of Hugo\r\n     Stinnes if I would meet him in Berlin on the Thursday.\r\n     Lieut.-Colonel Bauer, one of Ludendorff's aides-de-camp, a\r\n     gentleman largely responsible for the Pan-German leanings of the\r\n     General and for his close association with the interests of the big\r\n     manufacturers, had been to see Stinnes, and on the strength of the\r\n     information he had received from Lieut.-Colonel Bauer he thought it\r\n     advisable to have a talk with me. I declined the invitation because\r\n     I expected that the work they wanted me to do would be anything but\r\n     pleasant.\r\n\r\n     \"Next morning Herr Deters rang me up again and told me that Stinnes\r\n     would call on me in Hamburg on Friday morning.\r\n\r\n     \"I left for Hamfelde on Wednesday afternoon, but returned to town\r\n     again on Thursday, because Stinnes had arranged to call on me as\r\n     early as 10.30 a.m. on Friday.\r\n\r\n     \"The proposed meeting thus took place on Friday, August 23rd, from\r\n     10.40 a.m. to 1.15 p.m. Stinnes, with admirable frankness and\r\n     directness, started our conversation by stating that the military\r\n     situation had become much worse. Our troops, he said, began to fail\r\n     us in our task, and the number of deserters had been very large\r\n     lately (he mentioned, I believe, that their number was 32,000).\r\n     Ludendorff had told the Crown Prince the plain truth; but it was\r\n     still necessary to explain the true state of affairs to the Kaiser,\r\n     and to make it clear to His Majesty that Hertling, who was\r\n     completely laid up with sickness, could no longer effectively fill\r\n     his post. The real work was done by his son, Captain v. Hertling,\r\n     and no efforts were being made to come to a cessation of\r\n     hostilities. In other directions, too, matters were drifting\r\n     towards a catastrophe. The Minister of War, v. Stein, lacked the\r\n     necessary authority. In many instances the men called up did not\r\n     enlist at all; in Silesia large numbers of them had concealed\r\n     themselves in the woods and forests, and their wives provided them\r\n     with food, while no energetic steps to check these occurrences were\r\n     taken by the Chief Army Command. I replied to Stinnes that if\r\n     Ludendorff agreed I would be ready to undertake the unpleasant task\r\n     of informing the Kaiser, but that it would first be necessary that\r\n     Ludendorff and myself should come to an understanding as to whom to\r\n     propose to His Majesty for the Chancellorship.\r\n\r\n_\"Continuation. Hamburg, August 26th, 1918._\r\n\r\n     \"Stinnes said he thought that Ludendorff had Prince Bülow in his\r\n     mind. I told Stinnes that Bülow, in my opinion, might perhaps be\r\n     suitable at the head of a peace delegation, but that it was too\r\n     late to think of him as a possible Chancellor, and that the German\r\n     people--more particularly the Socialists--had not now the requisite\r\n     confidence in his ability to fill the post of Chancellor. Neither\r\n     would he be acceptable to our enemies. It would be difficult to\r\n     persuade Great Britain, the United States and France that a prince,\r\n     especially Prince Bülow, would seriously carry out the\r\n     democratization of Germany. If, however, we really were to discuss\r\n     peace at last it would be necessary that the office of Chancellor\r\n     should be vested in a man to whom our enemies could take no\r\n     possible exception. Stinnes perfectly agreed with me in this\r\n     matter.\r\n\r\n     \"We continued to discuss other possible candidates for the post,\r\n     but we could not agree on anyone. Finally Stinnes proposed that we\r\n     should both go to Berlin and there continue the discussion together\r\n     with Lieut.-Colonel Bauer, Ludendorff's representative. He would in\r\n     the meantime report to Berlin about our conversation, and he was\r\n     hopeful that we could see Bauer either to-night (Monday), or\r\n     to-morrow (Tuesday, August 27th).\r\n\r\n     \"This morning Stinnes informed me through Deters that he had sent\r\n     me a wire stating that the proposed meeting could not take place\r\n     until Monday next, September 2nd, at 8 p.m. He proposed that we\r\n     should have a preliminary meeting at the Hotel Continental at 7\r\n     p.m. the same evening. I suggested that it would be better to fix\r\n     this preliminary meeting at 6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n     \"I must add that Bauer's (that is Ludendorff's) suggestion was that\r\n     I should not see the Kaiser by myself, but together with Stinnes,\r\n     Duisburg, and Krupp v. Bohlen.\r\n\r\n     \"I replied to Stinnes that I considered it very inadvisable for\r\n     such a deputation to visit the Kaiser, who would never tolerate\r\n     that four gentlemen--two of whom were perfect strangers to\r\n     him--should speak to him about such matters. It would be better\r\n     that Herr v. Bohlen, or, if Ludendorff attached special value to\r\n     it, I myself should call on the Kaiser in private, and that either\r\n     Herr v. Bohlen or I should then endeavour to induce the Kaiser to\r\n     see the other three gentlemen as well.\r\n\r\n     \"Stinnes was greatly depressed and took as grave a view of the\r\n     situation as I did myself.\"\r\n\r\nBallin's notes on the Berlin meeting are confined to a few jottings,\r\nfrom which it appears that not Lieutenant-Colonel Bauer but Major v.\r\nHarbou in his stead took part in it, and that the question of selecting\r\na suitable candidate for the Chancellorship proved impossible of a\r\nsatisfactory solution. As a last resort, if everything else should fail,\r\nBallin thought of proposing Stinnes himself, because in his opinion the\r\nsituation demanded a man of dictatorial character and with the authority\r\nof a dictator.\r\n\r\nConcerning his interview with the Kaiser, Ballin wrote down the\r\nfollowing notes:\r\n\r\n     \"I arrived at Wilhelmshöhe on the morning of September 5th, and I\r\n     was asked to 'report' to the Kaiser at 12.45 p.m. This expression\r\n     was chosen because the new head of the Kaiser's Civil Cabinet, Herr\r\n     v. Berg, evidently wished to invest my visit with an official\r\n     character which would enable him to be in attendance. After a\r\n     while, however, the Kaiser became impatient and did not wish to\r\n     wait till the hour appointed for the interview. So I was requested\r\n     by telephone to hold myself in readiness by 11 o'clock.\r\n\r\n     \"I went to the Castle at that hour and waited in the room of the\r\n     aide-de-camp until the Kaiser came and asked me to go for a walk\r\n     with him. However, Herr v. Berg was also there and accompanied us.\r\n     Consequently the conversation lost much of the directness which\r\n     would have been highly desirable in the Kaiser's own interest, as\r\n     well as in that of the country.\r\n\r\n     \"I found the Kaiser very misinformed, as usual, and full of that\r\n     apparent buoyancy of spirit which he likes to display in the\r\n     presence of third persons. The facts have been twisted to such an\r\n     extent that even the serious failure of our offensive--which, at\r\n     first, had depressed him very much--has been described to him as a\r\n     success. It is now intended to retire to the old Hindenburg line,\r\n     so that the only result of the offensive has been the loss of\r\n     several hundreds of thousands of valuable lives. All this, as I\r\n     have said, is dished up to the poor Kaiser in such a fashion that\r\n     he remains perfectly blind to the catastrophic effect of it.\r\n\r\n     \"He now puts his whole trust in Herr v. Hintze, whom he evidently\r\n     looks upon as a great light.\r\n\r\n     \"I told the Kaiser of my grave misgivings and made him clearly\r\n     understand that I did not think there would be much use in entering\r\n     into peace negotiations with Great Britain. I urged that no time\r\n     should be lost in immediately approaching Wilson, who was an\r\n     idealist and who had no territorial aspirations in Europe. If,\r\n     however, the war should continue much longer Wilson would most\r\n     probably become subject to the influences of a war party, and then\r\n     we could no longer hope that he would still insist upon a\r\n     settlement along the lines of his idealist programme.\r\n\r\n     \"The Kaiser agreed that my views were well founded, but he thought\r\n     we ought not to enter into peace negotiations before the approach\r\n     of autumn, by which time we should have returned to the safe\r\n     position afforded by the Hindenburg line. Then, he thought, we\r\n     should avail ourselves of the offer of mediation which had been\r\n     made by the Queen of Holland.\r\n\r\n     \"Whenever I was too frank in my criticisms and suggestions, Herr v.\r\n     Berg skilfully interposed. He declared to me when the Kaiser had\r\n     left that it would not do to make His Majesty too pessimistic.\r\n\r\n     \"I also discussed with the Kaiser the question of doing away with\r\n     the restrictions imposed upon the sale of perishable articles of\r\n     food, such as butter, eggs, etc.; and I pointed out to him that the\r\n     fixing of maximum prices and the issuing of regulations dealing\r\n     with illicit trading merely forced the people to pay exorbitant\r\n     prices, at the same time helping those engaged in underhand trading\r\n     to amass huge fortunes. On this subject, too, the Kaiser fell in\r\n     with my own views, and it was decided to release at least the\r\n     perishable articles, and to allow them to be sold once more through\r\n     the ordinary channels without restriction.\r\n\r\n     \"The Kaiser also declared that this war would soon be followed by\r\n     another, to which he referred as the Second Carthaginian War. He\r\n     spoke a great deal of an Anglo-American alliance which would, of\r\n     course, be directed against Japan, and the views on political\r\n     subjects which he expressed in this connexion showed that he is\r\n     being very badly advised indeed.\r\n\r\n     \"Herr v. Berg is obviously conservative and Pan-German in his\r\n     politics, and it seems that his influence is predominant at Court.\r\n     Only on the Prussian suffrage question did he agree with my own\r\n     standpoint, which is that universal suffrage must be granted now\r\n     that the King has promised it.\r\n\r\n     \"Since the Kaiser and the Kaiserin, on account of the latter's\r\n     illness, were dining alone, I joined the so-called 'Court Marshal's\r\n     table,' together with the Countesses Keller and Rantzau, the\r\n     gentlemen-in-waiting on the Kaiser, and the physician-in-ordinary\r\n     and the chamberlain of the Kaiserin. The duty of acting as court\r\n     marshal fell to General v. Gontard, as Herr v. Reischach had\r\n     unfortunately fallen seriously ill.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate further what has been shown to be Ballin's views\r\non the character of the Kaiser, I here quote the first part of a letter\r\nof his, dated October 25th, 1918:\r\n\r\n     \"In the meantime,\" he writes, \"Wilson's reply has been received,\r\n     and it is certain that compliance with its terms will be equivalent\r\n     to capitulation.\r\n\r\n     \"To my mind Wilson's note clearly shows that he and his allies will\r\n     demand that the Hohenzollerns, or at any rate the Kaiser and the\r\n     Crown Prince, shall relinquish their rights to the throne, and\r\n     that, in consideration of such an act, they will ease their terms\r\n     of peace.\r\n\r\n     \"Each of the men who are at the head of their respective\r\n     Governments has to play to his gallery, and if these men desire to\r\n     give their audience a convincing proof of the completeness of the\r\n     success they have achieved, they can do no better than demand\r\n     condign punishment for the man who has been held responsible for\r\n     the war, and inflict it upon him. I do not believe that the Kaiser\r\n     would grieve very much if he were given a chance now of retiring\r\n     into private life without much loss of dignity. The war, which was\r\n     something absolutely uncongenial to his whole nature, has had such\r\n     bad effect on his health that it would be desirable in his own\r\n     interest if he were enabled to retire comfortably into private\r\n     life. He must see the force of this argument himself, and it is not\r\n     likely that he would refuse to accept such a chance, as a refusal\r\n     would prejudice the best interests of his country. The Kaiserin,\r\n     however, may be expected to oppose any such solution with much\r\n     feeling. If the Kaiser's grandson were now appointed his successor,\r\n     and if a regent were nominated in whom everybody had confidence,\r\n     the whole German situation would lose much of its seriousness. Of\r\n     course, the abdication of the Kaiser would not take place without\r\n     certain disturbances, but it would be necessary to face these\r\n     disadvantages with a good grace. No doubt the outlook would be\r\n     better if they could be avoided, and if the Kaiser, without losing\r\n     his position, could be invested with rights and duties similar to\r\n     those of the British king, who, broadly speaking, enjoys all the\r\n     advantages of his dignity without having to take upon himself\r\n     responsibilities which he is unable to bear. I quite believe that\r\n     the Kaiser never derived much pleasure from his sovereign powers;\r\n     at any rate, if he did, he has ceased to do so since this\r\n     unfortunate war has been forced upon him.\"\r\n\r\nBallin's last entry in his diary contains the following passage:\r\n\r\n     \"Stinnes has sent word to me that the Socialist and Centre parties\r\n     are of opinion that I ought to be nominated to conduct the peace\r\n     negotiations. I have told him that I should not shirk it, but that\r\n     I should be much better pleased if somebody else would do it.\"\r\n\r\nThis note was written on November 2nd, 1918. One short week later, on\r\nNovember 9th, his heart had ceased to beat--a heart which had so warmly\r\nresponded to the call of his Kaiser and country, and which had succumbed\r\nto its excessive load of grief and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo present an exhaustive description of Albert Ballin's life-work within\r\nthe compass of this volume is an impossible task, and the more the\r\nwriter entered into the details of his attempt to do so, the more\r\nthoroughly did he realize this impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe story of a life comprising thirty-two years of incessant hard work,\r\nonly interrupted when nature's law or a very imperative behest of his\r\nmedical adviser made it necessary, and spent at the head of an\r\nundertaking which, as a result of this work, developed into one of the\r\ngreatest that the economic history of the generation just passed has\r\nknown, cannot be told in full by means of a mere description unless it\r\nbe accompanied by volumes of statistics which, however, convey no\r\nmeaning to anyone except the initiated.\r\n\r\nThe author, therefore, had to content himself with delineating a picture\r\nof his hero with a background formed by the events which he himself had\r\nhelped to shape, and which, in many instances, had received their\r\ndistinguishing stamp through his own genius. The essence of his\r\ncharacter, and the importance of his work to his contemporaries, must\r\nstand out from this background as the portrait of a painter--as seen by\r\nhimself--would stand out from a mirror. What the mirror does not show,\r\nand cannot show, is the immensity of the mental forces hidden below the\r\nsurface which alone give expression to the portrait; all the factors\r\nwhich have brought about the final result--the strength, the courage,\r\nthe daring, and the feeling of responsibility without which it would\r\nnever have been achieved.\r\n\r\nStill more difficult it is to interpret the very essence of the\r\ncharacter of him whose work we see before us, or, indeed, to give a\r\ncomprehensible account of it to the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe only way of doing justice to a man of such commanding genius as\r\nBallin is to try to discover first of all the one essential root\r\nprinciple of his personality. Having succeeded in that, we shall find no\r\nmore difficulty in reconciling the great number of apparently mutually\r\ncontradictory traits of his character. This principle is the focus where\r\nall the rays of light are collected from all directions, and which forms\r\nthe source of light, warmth, and vital energy.\r\n\r\nAlbert Ballin was a born business man if ever there was one. To him the\r\nnoble words of Schiller's lines apply: \"The treasures which his ships\r\ncarry across the oceans spell untold blessings to all who receive them.\"\r\nHis whole mind was drawn towards the sea; his inborn inclinations and\r\nthe surroundings amidst which he grew up had destined him to be a\r\nshipping man. To the boy Ballin the Hamburg harbour was the favourite\r\nplayground; and the seven seas were just large enough to serve as a\r\nfield of action for the youth and the man. There was his real home, and\r\nthere he felt at rest. How often, indeed, has he assured us that the\r\nsleeplessness to which he fell an unfortunate victim whenever he was\r\nashore left him as soon as he was on board ship, and that a miserable\r\nriver barge was sufficient to have this effect on him. He was proof\r\nagainst sea-sickness, both bodily and mentally. Thus he became a\r\nshipping man, because it was his natural vocation; and in this chosen\r\nprofession of his he became one of the greatest and most brilliantly\r\ngifted rulers the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nWhenever there was a problem to be solved he attacked it in a spirit of\r\nboldness, yet tempered by the utmost conscientiousness and caution. No\r\ntask he encountered was so big that his daring could not tackle it and\r\novercome its difficulties; nothing was so insignificant that he would\r\nnot attend to it somehow. Whatever decision his infallible instinct\r\nintuitively recognized as right, and to whatever idea his impulsive\r\nnature had given practical shape, had to pass muster during the\r\nsleepless hours of the night before the tribunal of his restless mind\r\nwhen, as he used to say, \"everything appears wrapt up in a grey mist.\"\r\nAt such times his reason began to analyse and to criticize the decisions\r\nhe had reached during the day. Then he would often shudder at his own\r\nboldness, and the torments of doubt would be aggravated by the thought\r\nof the enormous responsibility which he bore towards his company. For it\r\nmust be understood that from the day he joined the Hamburg-Amerika Linie\r\nhis interests and those of the company became parts of an inseparable\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe company's affairs absorbed all his thoughts at all times; the\r\ncompany's well-being was the object of his constant care; he devoted\r\nhimself exclusively to the service of the company, and the opinions\r\nwhich he formed in his mind regarding persons and things were\r\ninstinctively coloured according to their relationship to the company's\r\naffairs. The gradual progress during its infancy, the later expansion,\r\nand the final greatness of the company, were as the events of his own\r\nlife to him; when the proud structure which he had raised collapsed his\r\nlife was ended. His thoughts incessantly converged towards this very\r\ncentre of his being. All his work, all his words and deeds, were devoted\r\nto the furtherance of the company's interests. He identified himself so\r\ncompletely with the company that he actually was the Packetfahrt, and\r\nthe Packetfahrt was he. Even his love and hatred were rooted in the\r\ncompany. He remained a grateful and lifelong friend to anyone who had\r\nbeen of service to the company or to him as representing it.\r\n\r\nThis highly subjective and indissoluble relationship between himself and\r\nthe company--which it had been the dream of his life to raise to the\r\nhighest pinnacle of prosperity--is the key to the fundamental principle\r\nwhich lies at the root of his whole complex personality. But however\r\nwell-defined his personal individuality stood out, his subjectivity was\r\nnevertheless animated by a strong sense of duty. His views, for\r\ninstance, on the essential principles governing the most perfect\r\norganization which modern capitalism has produced--i.e. the joint-stock\r\ncompany--were free from any tinge of personal considerations whatever.\r\nHe was himself the responsible head of a big joint-stock company, and\r\ninstinctively this fact exercised such a powerful influence on all his\r\nthoughts and feelings that it is quite impossible to arrive at a just\r\nappreciation of his character unless this circumstance is borne in mind.\r\nHis character which appears so complicated to the cursory onlooker, but\r\nwhich is in reality of singular simplicity and consistency, is best\r\nillustrated by his reply to a question of one of his friends who had\r\nasked him why he did not allow some piece of scathing criticism which he\r\nhad just expressed in private to be made public. \"My dear friend,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you forget that you are not the chairman of the board of\r\ndirectors of a joint-stock company.\" What he meant to convey was that\r\nthe enmity which he would incur by expressing those views in public\r\nwould adversely affect the firm of which he was the head, and that the\r\ninterests of his company compelled him to impose upon himself\r\nrestrictions which he could ignore in his private capacity.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had nothing but scorn for the very suggestion that this\r\ncompany should receive at any time any subsidies from public funds, he\r\nmade it to the fullest extent subservient to the needs of the public and\r\nof the nation at large. He often remarked that such gigantic concerns\r\nas, e.g., the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, are no longer private ventures\r\npurely and simply. The ties that bind them to the whole economic life of\r\nthe nation--and, for the matter of that, to the world in general--are so\r\nclose and so manifold that it would be disastrous to ignore them or to\r\nsever them. Hundreds of industrial, commercial, and agricultural\r\nenterprises were lavishly supplied with work through the orders they\r\nreceived from the Hamburg-Amerika Linie in connexion with the building\r\nand the equipment of its steamers and with the needs of its\r\norganizations on shore. Its hundreds of thousands of passengers and\r\nemigrants, and the huge volume of German-made products and manufactured\r\narticles carried on board its vessels, spread the German name and German\r\nfame throughout the civilized world. Hence, to Albert Ballin the\r\nnational flag and that of the Hapag were two symbols expressive of but\r\none idea.\r\n\r\nA man who, like Ballin, was at the head of the biggest German shipping\r\ncompany and therefore also, by implication, one of the leading spirits\r\nin the economic life of Germany, could not very well hold himself aloof\r\nwhere high politics were concerned. The more the economic problems\r\ngained in importance, the greater became their bearing on the course of\r\nthe country's politics. Ballin, however, would never have become a\r\nprofessional politician from inclination, because he invariably refused\r\nto be mixed up with the strife of parties. He never officially belonged\r\nto any political party; and although he made friends with members of all\r\nthe non-Socialist parties, his general outlook on politics was mainly\r\ncoloured by Liberal views, and he was a firm believer in Free Trade.\r\nWhenever questions dealing with the interests of shipping and trade were\r\ninvolved, he had no difficulty in making the responsible people listen\r\nto his claims and to his suggestions, but he never tried to make his\r\ninfluence felt on purely political affairs unless they affected the\r\ncountry's vital international interests. His lengthy and extensive\r\ntravels to the countries of Europe, to the North American continent, and\r\nto the Far East, had broadened his outlook. His profession as a shipping\r\nman not only brought him into frequent contact with the heads of the big\r\nshipping companies all the world over, but also with a number of the\r\nfinancial magnates and industrial captains of Great Britain, the United\r\nStates, and other countries of economic importance. He took rank with\r\nthe greatest economic leaders as an equal, and this unchallenged\r\nposition of commanding authority was reflected by the esteem in which he\r\nwas held by the principal statesmen and parliamentarians. He was\r\nfamiliar with the essential and vital needs of other nations, and he\r\ntherefore not only stood up for the national rights whenever they\r\nappeared in jeopardy, but he also raised his warning voice against a\r\npolicy provocative of conflicts whenever he thought it possible to avoid\r\nthem. Whoever is conscious of his strength is also aware of the\r\nlimitations set to his power.\r\n\r\nIn politics as well as in business he held that \"a lean compromise was\r\npreferable to a fat lawsuit,\" as the German proverb puts it. It has been\r\nmentioned elsewhere in this volume that Ballin was essentially the man\r\nof compromise. It is very probable that the experiences of his early\r\nlife had helped to develop this outstanding feature of his personality.\r\nIt may be assumed that he, a young man of unknown Jewish family, found\r\nhis path beset with difficulties in a city-state like Hamburg, where the\r\ninfluence of the wealthy patriciate of the merchant classes was\r\nsupreme, and that he was looked upon as an upstart even after he had\r\nreached a prominent position himself. The casual observer is far too\r\nmuch inclined to underestimate the conservative character--both\r\npolitically and socially--of the three Hanseatic cities. Still, evidence\r\nis not wanting that Ballin's unusual gifts were occasionally recognized\r\nand appreciated even in the days of his early career. An English\r\njournalist, for instance, who met him some time about 1895,\r\ncharacterized him by the following words: \"He struck me as a great man;\r\notherwise nothing so incongruous as such a type of man at the head of a\r\nbig steamship line could be imagined.\" That Field-Marshal Count\r\nWaldersee honoured him by his friendship at an early period has been\r\nmentioned in a different chapter of this volume. And even in patrician\r\nHamburg he found an immensely powerful friend and patron shortly after\r\nhe had entered the services of the Packetfahrt. This was no less a man\r\nthan the shipowner Carl Laeisz, the most eminent representative of the\r\n\"House of Laeisz.\"\r\n\r\nThe firm of F. Laeisz, which was successfully owned by its founder,\r\nFerdinand, his son Carl, and his grandson Carl Ferdinand, has stood\r\nsponsor to all the more important shipping companies established in\r\nHamburg, and through its great authority helped them all to get over the\r\ncritical years of their early youth. The sound principles by which the\r\nfirm was guided might sometimes lead to much disappointment on the part\r\nof the shareholders, but they proved to be of unsurpassable benefit to\r\nthe companies concerned, and nothing illustrates them better than the\r\noft-told episode of the shareholder who went to see Carl Laeisz,\r\ncomplaining that the Hamburg South American S.S. Company did not pay any\r\ndividend. \"The object of the company is to carry on the shipping trade,\r\nand not to distribute dividends,\" was the blunt but characteristic\r\nreply. Being thoroughly unconventional in his habits, Carl Laeisz--no\r\nless than his singularly gifted son, who was one of those rare men whom\r\nit was really impossible to replace--nevertheless did invaluable service\r\nin connexion with the establishment of new firms in Hamburg, and with\r\nthe encouragement of existing ones.\r\n\r\nIt was a great compliment to Ballin that in 1888, when he had only been\r\nassociated with the Packetfahrt for a couple of years, and when the\r\ndirectors asked for authority to increase the joint-stock capital of the\r\ncompany from 20 to 25 million marks, Carl Laeisz informed them in\r\nadvance that, at the general meeting of the shareholders, he would move\r\nan increase of 10 instead of 5 millions, and that this motion was\r\nunanimously carried. Those who have known Carl Laeisz personally will\r\nappreciate what it meant to Ballin when, by way of giving him an\r\nintroduction to the London firm of Messrs. J. Henry Schröder, Laeisz\r\nscribbled the following note on the back of one of Ballin's visiting\r\ncards:\r\n\r\n     \"It gives me pleasure to introduce to you the bearer of this card,\r\n     whom I am proud to name my friend, and to recommend him to your\r\n     protection and to your unfailing kindness.\r\n\r\n\"Sincerely yours,\r\n\"(_Signed_) LAEISZ.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this card was found among the papers and documents which Ballin left\r\nat the time of his death, it would seem that it was not used for its\r\nintended purpose, but that he preferred to keep it as a souvenir of the\r\nman whom he always remembered with gratitude and affection, and of whose\r\nlife he could tell a good number of characteristic anecdotes. The\r\ntelegram of which the text is given below is also highly typical of Carl\r\nLaeisz. I have not been able to discover what was the occasion of\r\nsending it, but I am inclined to think that it must be in some manner\r\nconnected with the conference held in the Berlin Royal Castle, and\r\nreferred to on an earlier page, at which Ballin first attracted the\r\nKaiser's attention. The text is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Persons who give in without a protest are miserable creatures, and\r\n     being such, they are deserving of nothing but contempt. Suggest\r\n     that you obstinately stick to Hamburg point of view, not only from\r\n     personal conviction, but for other weighty reasons as well. Meeting\r\n     hardly convened simply to induce you to give in.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there is scarcely anyone to whom the name of a Hamburg patriot\r\ncan be applied with greater justice than to Ballin, and although there\r\nare few people who have done more to promote the well-being and the\r\nprosperity of their native city, and who have had a better appreciation\r\nof one of the most lovable features of her inhabitants, viz. their dry,\r\nunconventional, and kindly humour, it would be wrong to assume that this\r\nlocal patriotism of Ballin made him blind to the shortcomings and\r\ndeficiencies of his native city. On the contrary, his eminent sense of\r\nthe realities of life made him see most clearly the points of weakness\r\nin the position of Hamburg, e.g. those connected with the system of her\r\nfinances. The so-called Köhlbrand agreement, which, after a hard\r\nstruggle, put an end to the long controversy between Hamburg and Prussia\r\nby stipulating that the course of the lower Elbe should be regulated\r\nwithout detriment to the interests of the town of Harburg, imposed such\r\na vast amount of expenditure upon Hamburg, and the Prussian local\r\nauthorities concerned insisted on securing the payment of such large\r\ncompensations to the owners whose rights were adversely affected by the\r\nimprovement of the waterway, that it might well be doubted whether\r\nHamburg could shoulder these enormous burdens.\r\n\r\nIt speaks volumes for Ballin's unprejudiced mind that he frequently\r\nmaintained nothing would be of greater benefit to Hamburg than her\r\nrenunciation of her sovereignty as a city-state in favour of\r\nincorporation with Prussia. Prussia, he argued, was her natural\r\nhinterland, after all; and if she consented to be thus incorporated, she\r\nwould be such a precious jewel in the crown of Prussia that she could\r\nsecure without an effort all the advantages and privileges which\r\nPrussia, by pursuing the strictly Prussian line in her politics, now\r\nactually prevented her from acquiring. In course of time, however, her\r\npresent isolation would undermine the foundations of her existence,\r\nespecially if and when the increasing volume of traffic passing through\r\nher port should demand a further expansion of the latter, and,\r\nconsequently, a further rise in the financial burdens. In that case the\r\nunnatural position which resulted from the fact that the \"Elbe delta\"\r\nbelonged to two different states, and which had its origin in the\r\npolitical history of the district, would make itself felt with all its\r\ndrawbacks, and the ultimate sufferer would be the country as a whole of\r\nwhich Hamburg, after all, was the connecting link with the nations\r\nbeyond the sea.\r\n\r\nThese are the same arguments and considerations which are used when the\r\nmodern problem of a \"Greater Hamburg\" is under discussion, with this\r\ndifference only, that in Ballin's time the only solution which was\r\nregarded as possible was that Hamburg should cast in her lot with her\r\nPrussian neighbour.\r\n\r\nBallin repeatedly vented the full force of his sarcasm against the\r\nadvocates of an \"out-and-out Hamburg policy\" to whom his own views\r\nsounded like heresy, a policy which found perhaps its most comic\r\nexpression in the speech of a former Hamburg burgomaster who referred to\r\nthe King of Prussia as \"our illustrious ally.\" Ballin did not recognize\r\nthe existence of a line of demarcation which, as many lesser minds\r\nimagined, separated republican Hamburg from the rest of Germany. In\r\nreality there is no such separation; Hamburg, indeed, receives year\r\nafter year a constant influx of human material and of ideas from her\r\nGerman hinterland, without which she could not exist at all, and in\r\nspite of which she has never had a superfluity, but--at times, at\r\nleast--rather a deficiency of specially gifted citizens. This latter\r\ncircumstance and the frequent absence of that quality of mental\r\nalertness which Bismarck, in speaking of the German character in\r\ngeneral, used to designate as the missing \"dash of champagne in the\r\nblood\" once made Ballin say: \"I quite see that what this town wants is\r\n10,000 Jews. I do not, by any means, shut my eyes to the disagreeable\r\nqualities of the Jewish character, but still, another 10,000 of them\r\nwould be a decided advantage.\" This utterance confirms how free from\r\nprejudice he was where the Jewish question was concerned. Although not\r\nat all orthodox, but rather indifferent in his religious views, he was\r\nfar too proud to disavow his origin or his religion, or to change the\r\nlatter. Of someone who had changed his name, he said, in a tone of\r\nbitter reproach, that he had insulted his father.\r\n\r\nBallin's relations with the working classes and his attitude towards the\r\nLabour question were not such as the Socialist papers were fond of\r\nalleging, especially at the time when the Labour controversy was at its\r\nheight, and when strikes were constantly occurring or threatening. The\r\nfirst big strike affecting Ballin's special sphere of activity was that\r\nof the Hamburg dock labourers in 1896. It was caused by wages disputes\r\nwhich the Packetfahrt tried in vain to settle by raising the wages paid\r\nto the men. The interests of the employers in the ensuing struggle were\r\nnot, however, specially represented by the associations of the shipping\r\nfirms, but were looked after by the big \"Association of Employers of\r\nLabour,\" and therefore the attitude taken up by the employers as a whole\r\nwas not determined by practical considerations from the point of view of\r\nthe shipping companies. The Packetfahrt, however, seems to have\r\nemphasized the necessity of being guided by such practical\r\nconsiderations, as may be inferred from the fact that the Packetfahrt\r\nwas the only one among the large firms of employers which advocated from\r\nthe outset that certain concessions should be granted in respect of the\r\ndemands put forward by the workmen. Although, as has been remarked, the\r\ncompany succeeded in seeing its recommendation adopted, the strike\r\nstarted on November 18th, 1896. At first it was restricted to the\r\ndockers, but the number of the strikers was soon swelled by the adhesion\r\nof the quay-labourers and of several other categories of port-labourers\r\nand seamen. When this had occurred, and when the Packetfahrt suggested\r\nthat steps should be taken on the part of the employers with the object\r\nof reaching a friendly settlement, these suggestions did not secure a\r\nmajority in the counsels of the employers, and it was in regard to this\r\nthat Ballin's notes, under date of December 9th, contain the following\r\nentry: \"We are continuing our efforts to induce the Employers'\r\nAssociation and the Shipowners' Association to give the strikers a\r\nchance of an honourable retreat. What we propose in detail is that the\r\nmen should be asked to resume work of their own accord in consideration\r\nof which the employers would promise to submit their grievances to a\r\n_bona fide_ examination. All our efforts have failed because of the\r\nattitude taken up by the Employers' Association. We can only hope that\r\nthe Senate will consent to mediate in the conflict.\" This body, however,\r\nwas afraid of being accused of prejudice in favour of the employers, and\r\ndeclined to act as mediator. \"It is very much against my wish,\"\r\nBallin's notes continue, \"that our own interests are represented by the\r\nEmployers' Association,\" and on December 23rd, he wrote: \"Meanwhile, the\r\nSenate, in reply to the resolution passed by the men, has asked them to\r\nresume work unconditionally against the promise to look into their\r\ngrievances, and as far as they appeared to be justified, to redress them\r\nafter a joint conference had been held between the employers and the\r\nstrikers. This offer of a compromise was rejected by the workmen.\" The\r\nemployers were able to get the most urgent work done by substitute\r\nlabour, and the strike came to an end in the early days of February.\r\n\r\nAmong the subsequent Labour troubles those of 1907 are of special\r\nsignificance. In that year, after a strike of the dockers and the\r\nseamen, all those employers who had occasion to employ any workmen in\r\nthe port of Hamburg founded an organization somewhat on the lines of a\r\nLabour Bureau, called the _Hafenbetriebsverein_. The termination of the\r\nstrike just referred to was brought about by Ballin's personal\r\ninfluence, and it was he who conducted the prolonged negotiations with\r\nthe heads of the Labour organization. Later on, in 1911, when the\r\n_Hafenbetriebsverein_ began to conclude agreements with this\r\norganization by which the wages for the various categories of dock\r\nlabourers were fixed--a policy which did not exactly meet with the full\r\napproval of large sections of employers, it was again due to Ballin's\r\ninfluence that these agreements were generally accepted. It is just\r\npossible that a certain event, insignificant in itself, may have\r\nstrengthened Ballin's natural tendency towards a settlement along the\r\nlines of a compromise. As has been said before, the year 1907, which,\r\nfrom the business point of view, had been excellent (at least, during\r\nthe first six months), and during which the above-mentioned strike\r\noccurred, was succeeded by a year which brought exceedingly\r\nunsatisfactory earnings to the company. Ballin did what he had done on a\r\nprevious occasion, in 1901: he sent a memorandum to all the employees of\r\nthe firm asking them to cut down expenses to the lowest possible extent,\r\nto contribute their share towards a more economical working of every\r\ndepartment, and to submit to him any suggestions of their own as to how\r\nthe necessary retrenchment could be effected. I was instructed to\r\nexamine the general expenses account with a view to finding out in what\r\nway a reduction would be possible, and I drew Ballin's attention to the\r\nfact that the considerable sums which had to be spent in 1907 in\r\nconsequence of the strike would, of course, not appear again in the\r\nbalance-sheet for 1908, so that this would lead to an automatic\r\nreduction of the working expenses. Ballin was surprised to see how large\r\nthis particular item was, and the whole occurrence proved once more that\r\na lean agreement would have been preferable to a fat lawsuit.\r\n\r\nAs Ballin was pre-eminently a man whose mind was bent on practical work\r\nand on the production of practical results, it is but natural that he\r\nwas greatly interested in the practical aspects of social politics, and\r\nthat he applied its principles to the activities in which he was engaged\r\nas far as he thought he was justified in doing so. Not in peace times\r\nonly, but also during the war did he hold these views, and when he was\r\nconnected with the work of provisioning the civil population, and,\r\nlater, with that of preparing the economic post-war reconstruction, he\r\nwas frequently brought into contact with men who occupied prominent\r\npositions in the world of Labour.\r\n\r\nHis capacity for work was enormous and seemed wellnigh inexhaustible. He\r\nmade a most lavish use of it, especially in the early part of his life,\r\nand the personal assistance he required with his work was of the\r\nslightest. His greatest aid, indeed, was his marvellous memory, which\r\nalmost enabled him to do his work without ever referring to the files of\r\nletters and documents. He could always recall to his mind every phase of\r\npast events, and every detail of all the ships he had built or\r\npurchased, and he was never wavering in the opinion he had formed of\r\nanyone who had ever crossed his path, because such opinion was founded\r\non facts.\r\n\r\nVery gradually only did his fellow-members on the Board of Directors\r\nsucceed in persuading him to refrain from putting in an appearance at\r\nhis office on Sundays, and to do such Sunday work as he wanted to do at\r\nhome. The telegraph and the telephone always kept him busy, both on\r\nweekdays and on Sundays. Even on his travels and on his holidays he\r\nwanted to be informed of all that was going on, and he could be very\r\nannoyed when any important news had been withheld from him, or when he\r\nbelieved that this had been the case, so that his secretariat, to be on\r\nthe safe side, had gone rather far in forwarding on his correspondence\r\nwhen he was away from town. When I first entered upon my duties with him\r\nhe had just returned from a rest cure at Kissingen. He pointed at the\r\nhuge pile of letters that had been forwarded to him on his so-called\r\nholiday, adding, in a tone of bitterness: \"You see, every expansion of a\r\nbusiness becomes a curse to its leader.\" Sometimes his absences from\r\nHamburg would amount to as much as eight months per annum, and it was\r\ncertainly no easy task always to know what to send on and what to hold\r\nover until after his return. To do so one had to be well acquainted with\r\nall the details of each transaction and to know what was important,\r\nespecially what was important to him; and if one wished to see his mind\r\nat ease it was necessary never to let him think that anything was kept\r\nback from him. Any apparent neglect in this respect he was apt to\r\nregard as a personal slight. And yet the time which he had at his\r\ndisposal for attending to current correspondence, both when at the\r\noffice and when travelling, was but limited.\r\n\r\nThe waiting-room outside his private office was nearly always crowded\r\nwith intending visitors. The callers were carefully sifted, and all\r\nthose who were strangers and those who had come without having an\r\nappointment were passed on to someone else as far as this was possible.\r\nGreat credit is due to his ever faithful personal attendant at home and\r\non his travels, Carl Fischer, for the perfect tact which he showed in\r\nthe performance of this difficult task.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this sifting, however, the time left for getting through\r\na day's mail was not sufficient. I therefore, shortly after entering the\r\ncompany's services, made it a point to submit to his notice only those\r\nletters which I considered of real importance. According to the mood in\r\nwhich he seemed to be I then acquainted him with the contents of as much\r\nof the remainder as I thought it wise to do. I believe I gradually\r\nsucceeded in acquiring a fair amount of skill in reading his mind, and\r\nthis facility enabled me to avoid more dangerous rocks than one. I tried\r\nto proceed along similar lines when he was away from Hamburg, especially\r\nwhen he was taking a holiday. On such occasions I forwarded on to him\r\nonly the important letters, taking great care, however, that he was not\r\nkept out of touch with any matter of real consequence, so that he should\r\nnever feel that he was left in the dark about anything. After some time\r\nI had the satisfaction of being told by him when he returned from a\r\nholiday that that had been \"his first real holiday since he had joined\r\nthe Packetfahrt.\"\r\n\r\nOnce one had learnt to understand his way of reasoning and his\r\nindividual traits, it was not difficult to know how to treat him. If a\r\nmistake had been made, or if some oversight had taken place, the most\r\nfoolish thing would be not to tell him so at once. To act otherwise\r\nwould mean the immediate and permanent forfeiture of his confidence,\r\nwhilst an open admission of the mistake would strengthen his faith\r\nenormously. He hated to be shut out from the actual practice of the\r\ncompany's business by a Chinese wall of bureaucratic control. Whenever\r\nsuch a wall was in process of erection he quickly and inexorably pulled\r\nit down, and he always remained in personal contact with every\r\ndepartment and with every prominent member of the staff as far as the\r\nsize of the huge undertaking enabled him to do so. For this reason he\r\nbut rarely, and only when the pressure of other business was encroaching\r\ntoo much on him, omitted to receive at his private office the captains\r\nwho came to make their reports to the directors. He knew, of course,\r\nevery one of them personally, as he had appointed many of them himself\r\nyears ago. He was no stranger to their various idiosyncrasies, and he\r\nknew all their good qualities. He was also personally acquainted with a\r\ngreat many of those unconventional and often somewhat blunt but always\r\ngood-natured individuals of humble rank who seem to thrive wherever much\r\nshipping is going on. He was not too proud to write an appreciative\r\narticle on the death of one of them, which, since it reflects high\r\ncredit on his own generosity and kindness of heart, ought not to be\r\nallowed to be forgotten altogether. It was published by the _Hamburger\r\nFremdenblatt_, to the staff of which the subject of his appreciation\r\nmight, in a sense, be said to have belonged.\r\n\r\n                                KUSKOP.\r\n\r\n     \"It was not until my return from England that I learnt, through\r\n     reading the _Fremdenblatt_, the news of the death of Karl\r\n     Kuskop--news which made me feel very sad indeed. Kuskop ranked high\r\n     among the few remaining real 'characters' of whom he was a type,\r\n     and as I was not able to pay my last respects to him I feel a\r\n     desire to do honour to his memory by a few words of personal\r\n     recollection, although Dr. Obst has already done so by means of an\r\n     excellent article of his own. For I believe I owe a few words of\r\n     farewell to a man of whom I have heard nothing but what was good\r\n     and generous throughout the better part of thirty years.\r\n\r\n     \"Karl Kuskop was a 'character' in the best sense of the term. He\r\n     was as harmless as a big child; and although he could scarcely be\r\n     said to be prominently gifted for his work, he did, indirectly at\r\n     least, a great deal of good within his humble sphere. His\r\n     popularity amongst all sorts and conditions of men connected with\r\n     shipping was tremendous. My personal acquaintance with him dates\r\n     back to the early trial trips of our steamers and similar\r\n     occasions--occasions at which Kuskop was present as the\r\n     'representative' of the _Fremdenblatt_. I still have a vivid\r\n     recollection of a magnificent summer evening when we, a party of\r\n     about eighty people, left the passenger reception halls by our\r\n     saloon-steamer _Blankensee_ on our way to Brunshausen where we\r\n     intended to go on board one of our new boats which was ready for\r\n     her trial trip. Kuskop, who was wearing his yachting cap and was\r\n     armed with a pair of huge binoculars, had taken up a position on\r\n     deck. He stood out very conspicuously, and a port labourer who was\r\n     working on board an English steamer as soon as he saw him, raised\r\n     the cry of _'Fremdenblatt_.' This cry was immediately taken up by\r\n     the people on the quay-sides, on the river-vessels, on the\r\n     ferry-boats, on the barges, and all other vessels in the\r\n     neighbourhood, and developed into quite an ovation which was as\r\n     spontaneous as it was popular. The worthy Kuskop appeared to be\r\n     visibly gaining in importance; he had taken off his cap, and the\r\n     tears trickled down his kindly face.\r\n\r\n     \"He well deserved this popularity. For years and years he\r\n     unfailingly saw to it that the Hamburg steamers, at whatever port\r\n     of the globe they arrived, found a _Fremdenblatt_ waiting for them,\r\n     thus providing a valuable and much appreciated link between the\r\n     crews and the old home. I myself have also reaped the benefit of\r\n     his attentive care. Years ago when I was making a trip round the\r\n     world I found the _Fremdenblatt_ waiting for me wherever I went;\r\n     and after having been so much out of touch with the civilized world\r\n     for weeks, that even Kuskop's genius could not discover my\r\n     whereabouts, I was agreeably surprised to find on arriving at\r\n     Vancouver all the old copies of the _Fremdenblatt_ that had failed\r\n     to reach me, carefully piled up in one of the sleeping compartments\r\n     of the saloon carriage which had been placed at my disposal for the\r\n     railway journey from the Pacific to the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\n     \"At that time I personally experienced the pleasant sensation--of\r\n     which our captains and the other officers had often spoken to\r\n     me--which one feels on reading the back copies of old newspapers,\r\n     calling up, as it does, vivid recollections of home. In company\r\n     with my wife, and some German officers who were returning from the\r\n     scene of unrest in China in order to complete their convalescence\r\n     at home, I greedily devoured the contents of the old papers from\r\n     beginning to end, thus passing in a delightful way the time taken\r\n     by travelling the long distance from Vancouver to Montreal. The\r\n     idea, which was afterwards made use of by Oskar Blumenthal in a\r\n     witty article, occurred to me to edit a paper which would publish\r\n     the news of the day a week after it had been reported, and even\r\n     then only as much of it as had proved to be true. Such a newspaper\r\n     would save us a great deal of unnecessary worry, as the contents of\r\n     this 'Periodical for the Dissemination of Truthful News' would be\r\n     sifted to a minimum.\r\n\r\n     \"But it is time to cut short this digression. When I met my friend\r\n     Kuskop again after my trip, it was at Stettin on the occasion of a\r\n     launch. He happened to be in especially high spirits, and even more\r\n     communicative than usual. He then told me the tale of his friend\r\n     Senator Petersen, and it is such a good story that it would be a\r\n     pity not to record it here.\r\n\r\n     \"It had become customary for the ships' captains and the other\r\n     ships' officers who could boast his friendship to treat poor Kuskop\r\n     to the wildest canards in return for his supplying them with\r\n     reading matter from their far-away home. One afternoon, when they\r\n     were sitting over a bottle of old port in Hermann Bade's wine\r\n     restaurant at Stubbenhuk and it was getting late, one of them--he\r\n     always referred to them as 'them young fools'--told him that a\r\n     river barge loaded with arsenic had just sprung a leak in the\r\n     harbour, so that it might become necessary to prohibit the use of\r\n     water for drinking purposes for some time. It was about five\r\n     o'clock and Kuskop, according to his own account, did not even stop\r\n     to finish his glass of port, but hurried to the offices of 'his'\r\n     paper which, in its next edition, published it as a fact that a\r\n     quantity of arsenic had vitiated the water of the Elbe. Next\r\n     morning, when Kuskop was still soundly asleep, two detectives\r\n     appeared at the house in which he lived, and escorted him to\r\n     headquarters, where he was locked up. At ten o'clock he was taken\r\n     up before Mr. Livonius--or whoever was the chief of police at that\r\n     time--who, with much abuse, demanded particulars concerning the\r\n     arsenic affair. Kuskop, seeing at once that one of 'them young\r\n     fools' had been pulling his leg, refused to supply any information\r\n     whatever. He was then brought before Senator Petersen, who, with a\r\n     great display of persuasion, tried to make him reveal the name of\r\n     his informant. Kuskop, however, remained obstinate, and the\r\n     Senator, changing his methods from persuasion to coercion, had him\r\n     locked up again. He remained in confinement till five o'clock in\r\n     the afternoon, and was then taken before Senator Petersen for the\r\n     second time, who now peremptorily demanded that he should state his\r\n     informant's name. Kuskop replied: 'Herr Senator, if you were in my\r\n     position, you would not give him away yourself.' The Senator turned\r\n     round to the police officials and said: 'Mr. Kuskop is a gentleman,\r\n     you see. We shall not get anything out of him. The best thing you\r\n     can do is to chuck him out,' which suggestion was thereupon\r\n     promptly and most efficiently carried out by some of those who were\r\n     present.\r\n\r\n     \"Another of his adventures he confided to me when a trial trip had\r\n     taken us right out into the North Sea. One of 'them young fools,'\r\n     he said, whom he regularly met at Mutzenbecher's tavern, had told\r\n     him as the very latest news that Captain Kier had been taken into\r\n     custody at Rio on the unfounded allegation of having committed\r\n     theft. Kuskop, feeling somewhat sceptical on hearing this\r\n     intelligence, but not believing himself justified in depriving the\r\n     readers of the _Fremdenblatt_ of such a highly interesting item of\r\n     news, thought he would be extra careful this time, and so did not\r\n     mention the captain by name, but merely referred to him as 'a Mr.\r\n     K----, captain of a Hamburg steamer.' This happened in the good old\r\n     times when there were still real winters in Hamburg, and when the\r\n     Elbe was sometimes ice-bound for months. The Hamburg steamers were\r\n     then compelled to take up winter quarters at Glückstadt--of all\r\n     places--and Kuskop used to establish a 'branch office' at that town\r\n     on such occasions. As bad luck would have it, he was fated one day\r\n     to meet Captain Kier there, who, with some of his friends, was\r\n     dining at his hotel. A huge tureen of soup with an enormous ladle\r\n     stood on the table in front of the captain, who was just about to\r\n     serve the soup when Kuskop entered the room. Without a moment's\r\n     hesitation the captain seized the ladle, the tureen, and everything\r\n     he could lay his hands on, and hurled them at him. He was, as the\r\n     latter afterwards confessed to me with the most innocent\r\n     expression, offended by the newspaper report, because, as it\r\n     happened, he was the only captain K---- on the route from Hamburg\r\n     to Rio at that particular time. He subsequently brought an action\r\n     against Kuskop, who had to retire from his business for some weeks\r\n     in order to get over the consequences of the mistake he had made.\r\n\r\n     \"These are only two of the minor adventures from Kuskop's ample\r\n     store of reminiscences. It is a pity that our sea-faring men are so\r\n     reticent; otherwise they would be able to furnish a volume of\r\n     material concerning Kuskop that would far exceed that relating to\r\n     Kirchhoff, that other well-known Hamburg 'character.' I wish\r\n     someone would collect all the Kuskop stories; for I do not believe\r\n     that we shall ever again come across such a perfect specimen of his\r\n     kind as he was, and it would be sad to allow such a man to be\r\n     forgotten.\r\n\r\n     \"Kuskop, however, was not only a 'character': he was also a 'real\r\n     good sort,' and he has been of real service to all those who have\r\n     ever travelled on Hamburg vessels. Because of that it is certain\r\n     that he will long be remembered; for it is not to him that the\r\n     following quotation can be applied: 'May each one of us--whether he\r\n     works with his hands or with his brain to earn a living\r\n     wage--always bear in mind that all that is best in him is gradually\r\n     lost in the process of toil, and that, after he has departed this\r\n     life, nobody will remember that he ever existed.'\r\n\r\n     \"Our friend Kuskop never lost his good qualities in the process of\r\n     toil, and he was always a friend and a helpmate to all decent\r\n     people. I am sure in saying this I have the support of all who knew\r\n     him, and so with us his memory will always be kept green.\"\r\n\r\nBallin very frequently went to New York--which might be called the most\r\nprominent outpost of the company--because he recognized the value of\r\nbeing in constant touch with every aspect of the many activities carried\r\non by the Packetfahrt, and especially with those persons whose interests\r\nit was of importance to the company to cultivate. The numerous pool\r\nconferences often took him to London, where he always made a point of\r\nkeeping on friendly terms with the leading British shipping firms, and,\r\nlater on, with some of the leading politicians as well. There were few\r\npeople in Germany who could rival him in his knowledge of the psychology\r\nof the American or the British mind. This knowledge resulted from his\r\ngreat capacity for rapidly and correctly summing up the character of\r\nanyone with whom he had to deal. He had developed to a high degree the\r\nart of treating the different types of people he met according to their\r\ndifferent individualities. His kindness of heart, his brilliant powers\r\nof conversation, his prodigious memory, his quickness of repartee, and\r\nhis keen sense of humour made him a favourite wherever he cared to be\r\none. One felt his charm as soon as one came into personal contact with\r\nhim. His wonderfully alert eye, which could express so much kindness,\r\nthe soothing tones of his melodious voice, and the firm and friendly\r\ngrip of his hand, made one forget that he was not a handsome man,\r\nalthough his powerfully developed forehead and his head which, in later\r\nyears, was almost bald, were of classic perfection.\r\n\r\nAlbert Ballin would never have gained the commanding position he held if\r\nthe keenness of his intellect and the force of his character had not\r\nbeen supplemented by that pleasing amiability which distinguishes all\r\nreally good men. To him was given a large measure of that noble courtesy\r\nwhich springs from the heart. He who could be hard and unyielding where\r\nthe business interests entrusted to his care were at stake, was full of\r\ngenerosity and sympathy towards the members of his family circle and his\r\nfriends. Nothing delighted him more than the happiness of others. Those\r\nwhom he cared for he treated with a tender regard which was deeply\r\ntouching. He loved to give presents, and did so with the most delicate\r\ntact. He never expected any thanks; it was sufficient for him to see the\r\nhappy face of the recipient. And if he ever met with ingratitude or\r\nspitefulness, he ignored it and dismissed it from his mind.\r\n\r\nPersonally generous to the limit of extravagance, he never spent a penny\r\nof the funds of his company without being convinced that it would be to\r\nits benefit. He left nothing undone when he thought he could realize a\r\nprofit to the company, or cut down expenses. Money, to him, was only a\r\nmeans to an end; and the earnings of the company were in the first place\r\nintended to be spent on increasing its scope and prosperity wherever\r\npossible. Those who know what remuneration the heads of other concerns\r\nreceive may well be surprised to see how little Ballin made for himself\r\nout of his position, but they would do him a great injustice if they\r\nthought he ought to have made more out of it. He even spent the greater\r\npart of his income for purposes of representation in the interests of\r\nhis company. His amiable charm of manner and his brilliant\r\nconversational gifts did much towards making the entertainments he\r\nprovided the successes they invariably were; and even if so much\r\nrepresentation, especially that in connexion with Kiel Week, became\r\nsomewhat of a burden to him, his company reaped rich benefit from his\r\nmunificence.\r\n\r\nBut to appreciate to the full the charm of his personality one must have\r\nbeen his guest at his beautiful home in Hamburg or at his beloved\r\ncountry seat near Hamfelde, and have listened to his conversation while\r\nsitting round the fire of an evening, or been his companion on his long\r\nwalks and rambles through the neighbouring Forest of Hahnheide. His\r\nconversation was always animated, his witty remarks were always to the\r\npoint, and he was unsurpassed as a raconteur. He was excellent as a\r\nspeaker at committee meetings, and he always hit upon the right words\r\nsuitable for a political toast. The skill with which he wielded the pen\r\nis proved by numerous newspaper articles, memoranda, and descriptions of\r\nhis travels, but above all by his voluminous correspondence. He was\r\nprobably one of the most versatile letter-writers, and yet so\r\nconscientious in this as to be almost pedantic. In his early years he\r\nhad also tried his hand at poetry. His beautiful home, which was adorned\r\nwith pictures and sculptures by eminent masters, was a source of great\r\npleasure to him. He was very fond of music and congenial company, and he\r\nknew how to appreciate the pleasures of a full and daintily arranged\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nWhen I intimated to one of Ballin's old friends that I intended to write\r\nhis Life, he told me that this would not be an easy task, and that he\r\nhoped I would not forget to depict Ballin as the amiable _charmeur_ to\r\nwhich side of his character so many of his successes were due, and which\r\nwas the secret of much of his great popularity. The number of people\r\nwho claimed to be his friends, both before and after his death, but\r\nespecially when they were trying to get some advantage out of the\r\ncompany, was surprisingly large. They were, in fact, so numerous that\r\nsuch a claim, when put forward, was generally--and rightly--looked upon\r\nwith a great deal of suspicion. Very often, when such self-styled\r\nfriends were announced to him, Ballin would reply: \"I do not know the\r\nman,\" or \"I do not remember him, but I may have met him.\" Ballin may\r\njustly be described as a man of world-wide fame, and whenever he went\r\nabroad the papers eagerly followed his movements. In New York especially\r\nit required all his cunning and resourcefulness to escape from the\r\nreporters desiring to interview him.\r\n\r\nOwing to his prominent position before the public he received an\r\nabundance of honours during his life. The many distinctions and presents\r\nwhich the Kaiser bestowed on him were a source of gratitude and delight\r\nto him, and he valued them because they were a symbol of the personal\r\nties that linked him to the Kaiser; but the foreign decorations, of\r\nwhich he also received a great many, were of so little interest to him\r\nthat he did not even trouble to have those of them replaced which once\r\nwere stolen from him. It was a great disappointment to him, however, not\r\nto be able to recover the Japanese ornamental swords which were taken on\r\nthe same occasion, and which he had always carefully treasured because\r\nof their high artistic value. They were a present from the Marquis Ito,\r\nwhom Ballin had once helped to obtain an audience of the Kaiser--an\r\naudience which, he hoped, would lead to the establishment on a permanent\r\nfooting of Germany's relations with the Empire of the Mikado. It would\r\nappear, indeed, that, if the leaders of Germany's political destiny had\r\nshown some more circumspection, the same friendly relations might have\r\nbeen brought about between Germany and Japan as were entered into later\r\non between Great Britain and the latter country. Personal souvenirs,\r\nlike those just mentioned, were prized so highly by Ballin that no\r\npersuasion would induce him to part with them, and even Professor\r\nBrinckmann, the Director of the Hamburg Museum for Arts and Crafts, who\r\nwas one of the leading authorities on the subject of Japanese applied\r\nart, and who tried hard to secure possession of them for his museum, met\r\nwith a flat refusal.\r\n\r\nEvery year Ballin spent at least six months, and often more, away from\r\nHamburg, and during such absences the work he had to accomplish was not\r\nless, but rather more than that which he did when in Hamburg.\r\nConferences followed upon each other in quick succession at all times of\r\nthe day, and the time that was left was filled up by visits. Often the\r\namount of work was so great that he had to get through a whole series of\r\ndifficult problems in a single day. The number of visits he had arranged\r\nwas always considerably augmented by numerous others not allowed for in\r\nhis arrangements for the day; because wherever he went the news of his\r\narrival spread immediately. He could never even think of travelling\r\nincognito. It is literally true that he was known to every hotel porter\r\nall over the world. He was in the habit of extending his hospitality\r\ntwice a day to a larger or smaller number of business friends when he\r\nwas travelling. At first his love of congenial society had prompted him\r\nto do this, but in after years he continued it because he wanted to\r\nsecure some benefit for his company even in his hours of relaxation.\r\nStill, he was often quite glad when, late at night, he had come to the\r\nclose of his day's work, and when he could let the happenings of the day\r\npass before his mind's eye in the quiet solitude of his room, or, as he\r\nliked to express it, \"to draw the balance of the day's account.\"\r\n\r\nEven before 1900 the never-tiring energy of his mind and the excessive\r\nstrain on his nervous system brought about a practically permanent\r\ninsomnia which never left him either in Hamburg or on his travels. Only\r\nwhen he was on the sea, or was staying at his country house, did he\r\nobtain any relief; and at such times he could dispense with the drugs to\r\nthe use of which he had become a victim more and more regularly and\r\nextensively as time went on. The fact that this habit did not entirely\r\nruin his nervous system proves that he was possessed of an iron\r\nconstitution, which only gave way under the huge strain caused by the\r\nwar. When he saw that his life's work had been broken to fragments, and\r\nwhen he felt that he had not enough strength left for a second attempt\r\nof such magnitude, even his immense nerve force collapsed under the\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nThe anxieties caused by the war--a war which he knew would be\r\nlost--weighed more and more heavily on his mind the longer it lasted.\r\nOutwardly he bore himself bravely and steadfastly, but his mind was full\r\nof dark forebodings, especially when he was by himself. If he had not\r\nhad the unvarying sympathy of the faithful partner of his life, with\r\nwhom he shared thirty-five years of mutual happiness, and if he had not\r\nalways derived fresh consolation from his beloved adopted daughter and\r\nfrom his grandchildren, he would indeed many a time have felt very\r\nlonely. In spite of his apprehensions as to the result of the war, he\r\nyet remained faithful to the task of his life, and he hoped against\r\nhope. His ardent love of his work was constantly struggling with his\r\nreason, which foretold him the ruin of the Empire and in consequence\r\nthat of German shipping.\r\n\r\nThis fact explains some apparent contradictions in his views and\r\nactions. What was the general public to think of a man who was watching\r\nthe progress of the war with the greatest pessimism, whilst at the same\r\ntime bringing all his influence to bear on the passing of a law which\r\nwas to make possible the reconstruction of Germany's merchant fleet,\r\nknowing that such reconstruction could only be achieved if the Empire\r\nwhich was to set aside the funds were to remain intact. In this matter,\r\nas in others, it was the intuition of the born business-man which guided\r\nhim, or perhaps a sort of instinct which made him discover new ways when\r\nthe old ones had failed. These forces of his mind had nothing in common\r\nwith logical reasoning, and they prevented him from drawing the\r\npractical inference from the sentiment so often expressed by us during\r\nthe war: \"If the Empire falls to pieces, we shall all be ruined; and if\r\nthe Empire becomes bankrupt, we shall be insolvent too.\" Events have\r\nshown that this sentiment was not justified by facts. Empires and\r\nindividuals may perish; but the nations, and their trade and commerce\r\nwhich are the outcome of their economic needs and of their geographical\r\nposition, will outlast them.\r\n\r\nNeither is it likely that the life-work of those men who have left their\r\nmark on their epoch will ever be in vain. There are two great\r\nachievements which, it appears, will always stand out like two pillars\r\nin the wreck of destruction that has fallen upon Germany, viz.\r\nBismarck's work of political unification, and--a necessary preliminary\r\nof it--the powerful economic foundations laid with incessant toil by the\r\ngreat industrial leaders of whom Germany had so many during the era of\r\nher prosperity.\r\n\r\nAlbert Ballin was one of the most gifted among their number, and the\r\nworld-wide fame of his achievements has outlived his death. When, after\r\nfive years of isolation from the rest of the world, Germany appeared\r\nonce more amongst the nations, she did so with the knowledge that the\r\nfoundations of the proud structure which Ballin had built up were still\r\nunshaken, and this knowledge has proved one of her greatest assets when\r\nshe entered upon the task of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIf German shipping is to flourish again, and if German steamers are now\r\nploughing the oceans once more, credit is due to Albert Ballin. His work\r\nit is from which new life is emanating, and it is to be hoped that his\r\nspirit will continue to animate German shipping both now and in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Extract Annotated by William II]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAden, 85\r\n\r\nAdler Line, 7\r\n\r\nAehrenthal, Count, 141\r\n\r\nAgadir incident, 162\r\n\r\nAgents, emigration, work of, 8\r\n\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, problem of, 272\r\n\r\n_America_, 12\r\n\r\n_Amerika_, 25, 106, 129\r\n\r\nAndersen, Mr., and the Danish Royal Family, 99\r\n\r\nAnglo-American Alliance, Ballin's opinion of, 256\r\n\r\nAnglo-German rapprochement, 134\r\n  shipping agreement, 18\r\n  understanding, 164, 165\r\n    advantage of, 136\r\n    Ballin as negotiator, 136\r\n    failure of, 133\r\n\r\nAnglo-Russian agreement, 137\r\n\r\nAntwerp, 81, 82\r\n\r\n_Aquitania_, 113\r\n\r\nAsquith, Mr. H.
