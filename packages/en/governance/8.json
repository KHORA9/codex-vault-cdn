The\r\ncomputers we used then didn't have lower case at all.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's Second Inaugural Address\r\nMarch 4, 1865\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow countrymen:  At this second appearing to take the oath\r\nof the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended\r\naddress than there was at the first.  Then a statement, somewhat\r\nin detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\r\nNow, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\r\nhave been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great\r\ncontest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies\r\nof the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress\r\nof our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known\r\nto the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory\r\nand encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction\r\nin regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts\r\nwere anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--\r\nall sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered\r\nfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\r\ninsurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--\r\nseeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\r\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather\r\nthan let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather\r\nthan let it perish.  And the war came.\r\n\r\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\r\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\r\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\r\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\r\ninsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\r\nno right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\r\n\r\nNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\r\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\r\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\r\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\r\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\r\nto the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\r\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's\r\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces;\r\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both\r\ncould not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.\r\n\r\nThe Almighty has his own purposes.  \"Woe unto the world because\r\nof offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe\r\nto that man by whom the offense cometh.\"  If we shall suppose\r\nthat American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the\r\nprovidence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\r\nthrough his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\r\ngives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due\r\nto those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any\r\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a\r\nliving God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently\r\ndo we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\r\nYet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\r\nthe bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil\r\nshall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash\r\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\r\nthree thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The\r\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\r\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\r\nto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds;\r\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\r\nand his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\r\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.",
