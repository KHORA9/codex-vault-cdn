The\r\nshortage of paper and man-power notwithstanding, the printing presses of\r\nthe Latin and Anglo-Saxon worlds have poured forth an undiminished stream\r\nof most enheartening and uplifting sentiment relating to the rights and\r\nvirtues of subject races. Prior to August 1914 small nations were happy if\r\nthey succeeded in escaping the attention of their powerful neighbours, but\r\nthey have now been raised from the relatively obscure fame conferred upon\r\nthe more unfortunate by those sympathetic or patronizing friends of\r\nliberty who have flourished characteristically in the English-speaking\r\ncountries. What was once the hobby of select groups of forward-looking\r\nLiberals has become the prerogative of their erstwhile opponents, the\r\northodox imperialists and upholders of predatory patriotism. Indeed, in\r\nmany instances, the professional gladiators of freedom find themselves\r\ndeprived of their occupation, since their philosophy of domestic and\r\ninternational politics conflicts seriously with the current official\r\ndogmas. The rescuing of small nations has become a \"controlled industry,\"\r\nand appropriate literature is issued in the shape of Blue Books and White\r\nPapers, or in the less ostentatious, if equally suspicious, form of\r\ninspired press propaganda.\r\n\r\nIreland had long been a subject of melancholy reflection in those quarters\r\ndevoted to international altruism of a not too personal kind. Even the\r\nBritish Liberal found an occasional tremor in his voice as he contemplated\r\nthe state of Irish affairs, and remembered his own virtuous conduct of the\r\ncase for self-government in Ireland. That voice, however, broke into sobs\r\nof indignation only when uttering judgments upon the iniquities of men\r\nfurther from home, and his enthusiasm for so proximate a victim of\r\nimperialism was checked by the tangible and daily proofs of his own\r\nfutility, less evident where his plea concerned a more remote\r\nbeneficiary. Distance lends enchantment to the Liberal view of\r\ninternational politics. For that reason it is natural to find the\r\nstrongest expressions of commiseration for Ireland outside the precincts\r\nof the Island Race, and, in fact, the Irish people have been accustomed to\r\nderive considerable satisfaction from the manifestations of good-will\r\nwhich they have received from Continental countries. The sympathetic\r\nforeigner, when not an Englishman, is spared the suspicions which his\r\nignorance of the actual facts might have earned for him, for both parties\r\nare likely to be at a mutual disadvantage in this respect. Moreover, the\r\nclaim of a Frenchman, for example, is overwhelmingly reinforced by the\r\nknowledge of material assistance rendered, none being so introspective as\r\nto question the motive of those historic replies of the French nation to\r\nthe call of Ireland. In return, did not Ireland alone distinguish herself\r\nin 1870 by a far-sighted rejection of Prussianism, at a time when the Hun\r\nfought for the recovery of Alsace amidst the plaudits of the politicians,\r\nstatesmen, and, above all, the moralists of Anglo-Saxondom? When the Irish\r\norganized a brigade to assist France against Prussia, the obstructionist\r\nand condemnatory attitude of the British Government seemed only further\r\nproof that Ireland's real friends must not be sought in England. These\r\nreciprocal manifestations of international appreciation are the definite\r\ncrystallization of a sentiment confirmed in Ireland by the fact that\r\nBritish and West British scholars have singularized themselves by an\r\nindifference and hostility respectively towards the language and\r\ncivilization of the Irish nation. Continental scholars, on the other hand,\r\nhave displayed an interest in Gaelic studies which cannot but induce in\r\nthe Irish people a comforting sense of their own dignity and importance.\r\n\r\nEverything, therefore, has combined to give Ireland a belief in her own\r\ninternational identity, and, recollecting her ancient grandeur, she has\r\nfelt entitled to the sympathy which her subsequent misfortunes have earned\r\namongst all disinterested students of a history by no means negligible in\r\nthe evolution of European civilization. When the great Allied crusade for\r\nthe liberation of small nationalities began, and the world resounded to\r\nthe cries of protest against the tyrants of subject races, the Irish\r\npeople were touched by this dramatic vindication of their age-long\r\ncontention. For a brief period the scepticism of centuries made way for a\r\ndegree of faith sufficient to bring a number of distinguished Nationalists\r\ninto the ranks of England, and under their impulse Ireland--as distinct\r\nfrom the West Britons--contributed what has remained her military share in\r\nthe conflict. The \"loyalists,\" of course, were relieved at the opportunity\r\nof exchanging the dubious pleasures of mutiny and gun-running for the more\r\nsonorous activities of a war for freedom. Having scotched political\r\nself-determination at home, they became seized of a praiseworthy ambition\r\nto confer that denied benefit upon the unenlightened foreigner. As for the\r\nmere Irish, they gradually realized the symbolism of this loyal gesture,\r\nthe Ulsterior motive became apparent: the war was on behalf of the small\r\nnations, but one had been forgotten. What is one amongst so many, it may\r\nbe asked? But the Irish could not rise to that level of almost divine\r\nimpartiality which is the natural sphere of the Britisher when he has\r\ndecided to right a wrong. The relative importance of Ireland could not be\r\nas apparent to an Irishman as to his benevolent conqueror.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for Ireland to reconcile herself to the thought that she,\r\nwho had engaged so much sympathetic attention, was now being overlooked.\r\nRather than risk the danger of a loyalist rebellion in the midst of\r\nEngland's great war, the British Government decided to put the strain on\r\nnationalist Ireland, rather than test the insistent love of the\r\nprofessional patriots. No doubt it would have been disconcerting to the\r\nimperialist illusion, had Ulster proceeded to stab its \"mother country\" in\r\nthe back, when asked to accept the measure of autonomy constitutionally\r\nand democratically conferred upon the Irish people. England preferred to\r\nrely upon the good-will of her political adversaries, mistrusting the\r\ncapacity for sacrifice of her vociferous friends. Even then, Ireland might\r\nhave been disposed to fight for those \"larger aspects\" of freedom so dear\r\nto the progressive philosophers of English politics, who have never yet\r\nbeen thus commanded: that the charity of political democracy begins\r\nabroad. Omniscient bureaucracy, in rapid process of becoming omnipotent,\r\nso met the efforts of those Irish who would have the national character of\r\nthe military alliance preserved, that the alliance did not take place.\r\nRebuffed in her natural demand for some tokens of national recognition as\r\na fighting unit amongst the Allies, Ireland began to realize the\r\nimportance of establishing an identity which was ignored, and was in\r\ndanger of being forgotten.\r\n\r\nNaturally resentment fixed upon the authors and mediators of the \"sacred\r\nunion\" which had failed to fulfil itself, and its weapon was that\r\noriginally forged for the defence of the conquest of a measure of autonomy\r\nabandoned under the terms of the political truce. The armed forces which\r\nhad been brought into existence by the threat of a loyalist rebellion were\r\nturned to the task of asserting the existence of a forgotten small\r\nnationality. In due course the Easter Rising took place, and by a\r\nblood-sacrifice Ireland once more claimed the rights which, she had been\r\nassured, were being enforced on the battlefields of Europe. Death having\r\nbecome more valuable than life, as a result of the new belligerent\r\nphilosophy of a world at arms, Irishmen determined to demonstrate that\r\nthere are more ways than one of dying for freedom. The hopelessness of the\r\nenterprise proved its ultimate strength, for desperate courage has a\r\npeculiar influence upon the pacific civilian, to which category the vast\r\nmajority of the Sinn Fein public belonged. Just as the militarist is\r\nenraged by the spectacle of defiant courage over which he has no control,\r\nso the non-combatant patriot is effected by what impresses him as mystic\r\nvalour. Even official testimony now records the triumph of that\r\ninsurrectionary failure, in so far as the stiffening of the national\r\npurpose is concerned.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Ireland, sentimentalism has become so fashionable in\r\ninternational politics, that realism, whether in thought or action, is\r\nabhorrent to minds soothed with sonorous phrases, and but dimly conscious\r\nof the facts behind the words. The mirage of glory not only obscures the\r\nmaterial horror of war, but it conduces to a certain impatience of ideas\r\nwhich are not coloured by the prevalent megalomania of idealism. The\r\nIrishman who dares to bring forward the case of his own country in\r\ndiscussion with belligerents is regarded as an inferior egotist, whose\r\nvision is so warped and limited that he cannot realize the great issues at\r\nstake. Otherwise intelligent men talk to him of the German hegemony of\r\nEurope and, by extension, of the world, with a seriousness differing from\r\nthat of the Pan-German League only in its abhorrence of that incredible\r\nambition. The rhetorical exuberances of Teutonic chauvinists are accepted\r\nas plain statements of policy by those who would not listen to their own\r\nJingoes. The actual, or contemplated, depredations of one imperialism are\r\nnot contrasted with those of another, but are used as a foil to the\r\nliberal and progressive aspirations of outraged political virtue. An\r\ninability to take either party at their own estimate is nevertheless\r\ncomprehensible in a people whose scepticism of Liberalism is equalled by a\r\ncorresponding doubt as to the possible differentiation of two\r\nimperialisms.\r\n\r\nAcute and not wholly orthodox exponents of the British international point\r\nof view have expended much ingenuity in finding a formula expressing the\r\nconscious or sub-conscious sense of rectitude which pervades the\r\nEnglishman in this debate with Ireland. Britain is depicted by these\r\ncritical friends as a well-meaning, if blundering, commercialist, whose\r\nimperial adventures, like the amorous adventures of races unblessed by\r\npuritan _Kultur_, must be regarded as venial sins. British imperialism,\r\nthey say, is not deliberate and systematic; it aims at no hegemony, and is\r\nthereby innocent of those evils which the \"free peoples of the world\" are\r\ninvited to destroy. As we have the testimony of several hundred years of\r\nAnglo-Irish history in refutation of this comfortable illusion, it is\r\nenough to say, for the present, that the matter presents itself with no\r\nsuch simplification to the Irish mind. Consequently, viewed in the light\r\nof this _Herrenmoral_, so natural in an imperial race, international\r\nevents take on a significance wholly incomprehensible to the unfortunate\r\nvictims of a transfigured and transcendental commercialism. Ireland,\r\ntherefore, can neither understand nor make herself understood, so long as\r\ndiscussion is confined to the unrealities of international politics. She\r\nis obliged to grasp with pathetic gratitude at the straws of comfort blown\r\nin her direction by the winds of the European debate, wherein she serves\r\nthe purposes of _tu quoque_ repartee.\r\n\r\nIn politics, as in literature and art, realism is abhorrent to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon temperament. Wherever the English language is spoken there is\r\nimplanted the tradition of moral and intellectual compromise. Revolutions\r\nare blanketed with reforms, unless, as happened in 1641, they can assume\r\nthe dignity of a religious crusade. Social problems are discreetly shelved\r\nby Acts of Parliament, and the facts of life delicately obscured by a\r\nliterature unique in its emasculation. Thus America condemns as\r\nunpleasantly improper the only honest record of actual warfare in the\r\ntrivial mass of Bairnsfatherly war books, _Le Feu_, by Henri Barbusse, a\r\nFrenchman unspoiled by the cult of anaemia. Sanctimonious reflections upon\r\nthe superiority of Anglo-Saxon morals are the response to the urgent\r\nquestion of venereal diseases as a by-product of war. The sexual problems\r\narising out of militarism are the commonplaces of all literature dealing\r\nwith the subject, but when the English-speaking world becomes for the\r\nfirst time conscripted, and is faced with the military system on a broad\r\nscale, the characteristic stampede to fact-proof shelters takes place. The\r\nhalf-world is not to be made safe for democracy, but must be declared\r\ntaboo. So man becomes chaste by prohibition.\r\n\r\nThat the present war is at bottom a struggle between two cultures, the\r\nAnglo-Saxon and the German, is indicated by the remarkable way in which\r\nthe ideals of the former have permeated the Allied world, strengthening\r\nthe natural preponderance, linguistic and material, of the element\r\nrepresented by the United States and the British Empire. The hands that\r\nare fighting may be the hands of France, Belgium, Italy, Roumania, Serbia,\r\nJapan, China, America, and San Marino, but the voice is the voice of\r\nBritain, whose most admirable mouthpiece is Dr. Woodrow Wilson. The result\r\nis the reaction of the world to the stimuli of recent history in the\r\nperfect British manner. When the Russian Revolution occurred there was but\r\nlittle response to the revolutionary contagion, which had, nevertheless,\r\naffected Europe on the previous occasions of similar social upheavals.\r\nEngland, of course, was the great buttress of reaction against the French\r\nRevolution, which could not recommend itself on religious and moral\r\ngrounds to the great Empire of respectability. Yet, France did succeed in\r\ninfecting Europe with revolutionary ideas. Russia, on the other hand, has\r\nevoked only the response of the strikes in Germany and Austria. Elsewhere\r\nthe reception of this dramatic transition from official words of freedom\r\nto popular action has been mixed and lukewarm. Nobody who understood the\r\nfundamental abhorrence of real liberty in the English-speaking countries\r\ncould have been surprised at England's unconcealed chagrin, and the\r\nsubsequent hostility of all but a handful of the people to the progress of\r\nrevolutionary government and diplomacy. What a relief when Germany finally\r\nimposed silence--and her terms--on Russia!\r\n\r\nThe prevailing tone of sentimental idealism in international affairs is,\r\ntherefore, unpropitious to those who, like the Russians and the Irish,\r\ninsist upon interpreting _au pied de la lettre_, the pious phrases which\r\nadorn the discourses of altruistic statesmen. Be the victims of oppression\r\nonly far enough away from immediate Allied control, then their wrongs\r\nbedim the eyes of the professors of Liberty, whose vision becomes too\r\nblurred to distinguish the close presence of political phenomena which\r\ndemand attention. In consequence, Ireland's movement of self-assertion\r\ndid not receive the good press which the occasion might normally have\r\nwarranted. America, though neutral at the time, denounced the \"disloyalty\"\r\nof Sinn Fein in the best Colonial style, leaving to the American-Irish the\r\nhyphenated distinction, shared with their American-German fellow-citizens,\r\nof displaying a very natural sympathy with their kin in \"the old country.\"\r\nThe racial ties of these two sections of Americans were, until\r\nintervention replaced benevolent neutrality, the only evidence of\r\nresistance to that anglicization of Allied opinion which has already been\r\nnoted. Once, however, Dr. Wilson had declared his intention of making the\r\nworld safe for democracy, repressive measures soon eliminated those\r\nmanifestations of opinion. They had been denounced, but tolerated, only so\r\nlong as it was legally impossible to suppress freedom of speech without\r\ninjuring the interests of the highly articulate Allies and their friends.\r\n\r\nThe unsophisticated Irishman in the United States had to reconcile himself\r\nto the paradox of the American denunciation of the Easter Week Rising, as\r\nif the analogous revolt of the founders of that great plutocratic Republic\r\nhad not differed only in so far as it was successful. The American\r\nseparatists were alike untroubled by the representations of the\r\nunionistic minority, and the preoccupation of England with the war against\r\nher commercial rival of the period. But the Irish separatists made not\r\neven a romantic appeal to a people whose appetite for uplifting sentiment\r\nmay be gauged by their profound conviction that the \"moral leadership of\r\nthe world\" had been thrust upon them, after the outbreak of war, by an\r\nappreciative Destiny. It is true that, during the two years when this\r\nparticular megalomania possessed the soul of America, her energies were\r\nexclusively concentrated upon the supply of munitions of war, with\r\noccasional humanitarian homilies, addressed to the Hun, and emphatic\r\nprotests against the Allied blockade, which was denounced as illegal and\r\nunjust, but has become much more stringent under Wilsonian auspices. It is\r\nhard to decide which of these two not wholly unrelated phenomena is the\r\ngreater tribute to the triumph of Anglo-Saxon culture; America's\r\ncondemnation of the Irish Republicans as \"traitors,\" or her reinforcement,\r\nwhen a belligerent, of blockade measures previously described as\r\nindefensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nREALISM IN IRISH POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this most intellectually belligerent of neutral countries the political\r\nmind has become realistic and critical, just when the combatant nations\r\nhave taken refuge in an uncritical and remote idealism from the sordid and\r\ndreadful realities of war. Amongst the belligerents, it is true, there is\r\ntalk of imposing ideals which, if ill-defined, have nevertheless called\r\nforth generous sacrifices from the inarticulate, plain people, who accept\r\nthe formulae officially or officiously provided for their guidance. But the\r\nmere fact of mobilization tends to emphasize the abstract quality of the\r\nformulae in which the combatants have summed up, in almost identical words,\r\ntheir allegedly conflicting purposes. The individual is obscured by the\r\nanonymity of the device emblazoned upon the banner under which he is\r\nengaged. The mind is mobilized no less than the body, so that it is\r\ndifficult to discern the personal emotion which must lie behind the\r\nself-immolation of so much bravery. Indeed, when collectively expressed\r\nin official utterances, the motives seem so abstract that President Wilson\r\nonce confessed his inability to distinguish between them. It was not until\r\nhe ceased to be a spectator of the conflict that he himself coined a\r\nphrase almost cynical in its bland inhumanity, coming from a country where\r\nthe rudiments of real democracy are scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nIn so far, however, as it is possible to read any intelligible meaning\r\ninto the word \"democracy,\" as currently employed, it must be prefixed by\r\n\"political.\" The world must be made safe for the political democracies,\r\nthat is to say, those countries which have provided themselves with the\r\n\"democratic institution\" of parliamentary government. A couple of\r\ncenturies ago the blessings of political freedom preoccupied the minds of\r\nthose countries which have ever since accepted the attainment of that end\r\nas a substitute for the liberty of which it seemed the simulacrum. Those\r\nwere the happy days when the discovery had not yet been made that\r\npolitical power is determined and conditioned by economic power, the\r\nformer being useless without the latter. The gradual realization of this\r\nhas been accompanied by a widespread disillusionment with party politics,\r\npopularly summed up by Mr. Belloc in his book, _The Party System_, which\r\nput before the general reader criticisms heretofore confined to Socialist\r\nliterature. The domination of politics by capitalism became an accepted\r\ntruism, and it was no longer possible for intelligent men to consider\r\ntheir \"representative assemblies\" with that seriousness so necessary to\r\nthe dignity and comfort of the political mountebanks. In short, without\r\nprejudice to the theoretical virtues of parliamentary government, the\r\nconviction was established that, under the regime of profiteering\r\nindustrialism, political democracy is an impolite fiction, and that the\r\npolitics of capitalism must be party politics, with all its inherent\r\ncorruption and dishonesty.\r\n\r\nThis process of disillusionment was not without its counterpart in\r\nIreland, since Irish politicians were part of precisely that political\r\nmachinery whose workings were being exposed in England. Moreover, within\r\nthe past quarter of a century Irishmen had begun to perceive that, by\r\nrelying upon themselves rather than upon their representatives at\r\nWestminster, they could get things done instead of being talked about.\r\nThey also observed that the most flourishing industrial and intellectual\r\nmovement in the country advanced amidst the indifference, when so\r\nfortunate as not to arouse the active hostility, of the politicians. It\r\nrequired very little, then, to arouse the suspicion that nothing more\r\ncould be obtained for Ireland by political action in England, and the\r\nignominious fate of the Home Rule Bill came as the final confirmation of a\r\nslowly accumulated scepticism. There was, of course, much of the\r\ninevitable ingratitude of the mob in this revulsion of feeling against a\r\nsystem which had been accepted by the Irish people, and had, within its\r\nlimits, procured them undeniable advantages. Ireland, being eighteenth\r\ncentury in its retarded political mentality, believed, and still believes,\r\nin the marvels of political liberty, so that the Parliamentary Party was\r\nnaturally outraged by the ficklessness of the anti-parliamentarian\r\ncampaign. Electors and elected equally believed in party politics, and the\r\nIrish Party could show, with reasonable pride, a record of definite\r\nparliamentary achievement, unequalled by any other minority party in the\r\nBritish House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the Nationalist Party was accused of the vices inseparable\r\nfrom the parliamentary system by those who very humanly imagined that such\r\nvices were not inherent in the system itself, but were peculiar to\r\nBritish parliamentarianism. In all criticism there was lacking any\r\nsuggestion of the possibility of similar defects in a purely Irish\r\nparliament. That is natural for two reasons. First, because the political\r\ndevelopment of Ireland makes it as premature for her to doubt the wisdom\r\nof her own elected assemblies, as it would have been for revolutionary\r\nFrance to question the practical value of the Declaration of the Rights of\r\nMan. Second, because the immediate cause of dissatisfaction with\r\nconstitutional nationalism was the evident impossibility of its ever\r\nrealizing the true aims of nationalism. Consequently, it is in vain that\r\nthe Nationalist Party appeals for recognition of its actual services. A\r\ngeneration has arisen which accepts as a matter of course the fruits of a\r\nhard struggle, and insists upon the one vital and essential fact, namely,\r\nthat the Irish members at Westminster have not brought Ireland a step\r\nnearer independence, and in the very nature of things, they cannot do so.\r\nMeanwhile, the burdens of over-taxation and misgovernment press every year\r\nmore heavily on the country. Party achievements are dismissed as of slight\r\nimportance by impatient and perhaps ungenerous critics, who assert--and\r\nrightly--that the Nationalist Party did not represent merely a section of\r\npublic opinion in the House of Commons, but represented the Irish nation.\r\nTherefore, the test of party politics cannot be allowed. To which it is\r\nopen to the apologist of constitutionalism to reply: you cannot\r\nparticipate in the game of party politics and then refuse to recognize the\r\nrules of that game. It is no more reasonable to believe that the Irish\r\nnation can be represented in the British Parliament, than to believe that\r\nthe British nation is represented there. In both cases the elected persons\r\nvaguely correspond to actual phases of popular opinion, elicited, as a\r\nrule, under conditions which would make it difficult for a crowd of\r\nphilosophers to express their judgment, not to mention a semi-educated,\r\nnewspaper-fed mob.\r\n\r\nWe can observe over the same period a gradual disintegration of confidence\r\nin elected representatives both in England and Ireland, though the\r\noperative causes have not been the same, to the superficial glance.\r\nIntelligent Englishmen have been driven to doubt the efficacy of\r\nparliamentary government by the exposure of party corruption, and by the\r\nrealization of the fact that political power is the shadow of which\r\neconomic power is the substance. Irishmen, on the other hand, having being\r\nbaulked of the opportunity of arriving at the same conclusion as a result\r\nof actual political experience in Ireland, found themselves, by force of\r\nnational circumstances, confronted with evidence of the futility of\r\nWestminster politics. They have reached the stage of disillusion, but are\r\nunable to see clearly the intervening stages, owing to the thwarted and\r\nabnormal political evolution of the country. If it seems a paradox to\r\nclaim that a country which has demanded a parliament of its own is\r\ndissatisfied with the parliamentary system, it should be recalled that\r\nthere is no necessary obligation upon the Irish people to set up in Dublin\r\na legislature upon the English model. The national political institutions\r\nof Ireland, as competent authorities have pointed out, are susceptible of\r\nmeeting the needs of a community, whose social and intellectual conditions\r\nare quite unlike those of England. Moreover, as our national economists,\r\nMolyneux, Berkeley, Swift, Lalor, and Connolly have shown, the Irish case\r\nagainst government from Westminster has been based, from the beginning of\r\nmodern history, upon this fundamental necessity for a combination of\r\npolitical and economic power, without which there can be no freedom. If\r\none aspect of the question has been over-emphasized, the fault is common\r\nto more countries than Ireland, and is peculiarly comprehensible in a\r\npeople whose political development has been interrupted and delayed.\r\n\r\nThe perversity of the fate which governs the relations of England and\r\nIreland obtrudes itself once more in this connection. It might be thought\r\nthat the simultaneous movement of revolt against the sham of politics\r\nwould lead to sympathetic understanding of the Sinn Fein point of view. It\r\nis true, to some extent, that during the pre-war years of constant Sinn\r\nFein activity, friendly references were made in certain English quarters\r\nto the regenerate nationalism which was manifesting itself in literature\r\nand industry. Under less ominous names the Sinn Fein spirit had developed\r\nand spread until, at the outbreak of the war, the country was apparently\r\nabsorbed in various enterprises which had received the benediction of\r\nbenevolent commentators, relieved to find Ireland at last in a practical\r\nmood. But the war has changed all that. Not only have these innocent\r\nundertakings been revealed as part of the malign machinations of Sinn\r\nFein, but the term itself has become associated with an event undreamt of\r\nin the essential pacific and economic philosophy of those who expressed\r\nsome twelve years ago the growing tendencies in the direction of national\r\nself-help. Sinn Fein did not repudiate the task which destiny thrust upon\r\nit in Easter 1916, but accepted the hitherto rejected theory of physical\r\nforce, at the cost of the platonic affection of many who had previously\r\nsmiled approvingly at the programme of social reconstruction contemplated\r\nby the founders of the Sinn Fein movement.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, if the Sinn Fein policy could have continued,\r\nafter the war had broken out, to escape the hostile attention of England.\r\nPolitical realists ceased to recommend themselves to the favourable notice\r\nof a people embarking upon a crusade for the Good, the True, and the\r\nBeautiful, and whose minds were glamoured by the idealisms so prodigally\r\nproclaimed since August 1914. In a burst of enthusiasm the \"free peoples\r\nof the world\" undertook to restore the right of small nations, and since\r\nthey knew of only one transgressor, they could not wait to consider their\r\nown possible sins against the spirit of nationality. At the same time, the\r\ndiscredit and futility of the parliamentary system became more and more\r\nobvious as it failed to meet the exigencies of the crisis which had come\r\nin the history of the political democracies. From the moment when the\r\nlatter undertook to vindicate their superiority they were obliged to\r\ncompromise hastily, when not to abandon entirely, the principles upon\r\nwhich they rested. Normally one might have thought that this would give\r\nthe final blow to a fiction previously weakened, but the seriousness of\r\nnational peril, coupled with the mobilization of thought, has helped to\r\nobscure that conclusion. Once the system had become a gage of battle, and\r\na challenge to the enemy, it was endeared to its defenders, who clung to\r\nit all the more desperately, the more elusive and illusory it appeared.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that Irishmen were invited to share the enthusiasm for an\r\nideal about which they entertained no more illusions, except the one which\r\nexperience had not had a chance to confirm or dispel. Pseudo-democracy\r\nthey knew and rejected, as revealed in the light of a spurious political\r\nliberty under the control of English Capitalism, but they had not yet been\r\nallowed to make the experiment of politico-economic freedom on their own\r\naccount. Meanwhile, by an amazing inconsequence, the imposition of these\r\npseudo-democratic conditions became the ambition of precisely the most\r\nrestive and acute critics of the political system upon which those\r\nconditions repose. The complete demoralization of the intellectuals by the\r\npresent war will supply some future critic material for sceptical\r\nreflection. In the past, both remote and immediate, the educated have\r\nsucceeded in differentiating themselves from the mob by refusing, in times\r\nof crisis, to be stampeded by appeals to ignorance. But gradually the\r\n_Intelligentsia_ had been learning the expediency of attaching themselves\r\nto some social or political propaganda until, when the war broke out, they\r\nfound themselves everywhere imprisoned by the new status they had assumed.\r\nThey were no longer free to serve their real master, but had sold their\r\nintellectual birthright for a mess of official pottage. Their conscripted\r\nminds have definitely lowered their prestige, since they have set\r\nthemselves to bluster and shout across their respective frontiers, in a\r\nmanner indistinguishable from that of the plain people, without\r\npretensions to mental discipline and rational speech. Though financially\r\nstrengthened the intellectuals have been bankrupted, as a class, by the\r\nwar for liberty.\r\n\r\nWithout postulating the incompatibility of reason and mob patriotism,\r\nalthough the divergence of the two has been recorded in prominent\r\nexamples, one may legitimately ask: Why this religious enthusiasm for an\r\nideal whose discredit and disintegration were the chief preoccupation of\r\nintelligent men during the years leading up to the war? The greatest\r\niconoclasts, so far as the idols of political democracy are concerned,\r\nhave become the most fervent advocates of such \"democratization,\" seized\r\nwith a malign altruism which would share its ills with those untroubled by\r\nthem. Benefits, which would be extravagant if claimed for a Utopia, are\r\npromised on behalf of a social organization whose human imperfections were\r\nnever more indecently exposed than during the crisis when it was exalted\r\nas the panacea of civilization. But, in inverse ratio to their own hasty\r\nabandonment of the fictions tenable only in the uncritical times of peace,\r\nthe pseudo-democrats urge the adoption of methods which even they find\r\nuseless in the stress of national crisis. The foxes having lost the\r\nornament of intellectual and economic freedom in the trap of capitalist\r\npolitics are convinced that the whole world should be handicapped in like\r\nmanner. The new gospel of equality of sacrifice, internationally\r\ninterpreted, means the equality of weakness.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that the great resources of the English-speaking world\r\nshould be pledged to the defence of the form of democracy which is the\r\nspecial creation of Anglo-Saxon culture, and that Britishers and\r\nAmericans, rather than Frenchmen and Italians, should be most insistent\r\nupon the blessings of \"democratization.\" That peculiar conception of\r\nliberty which has fostered the ignoble individualism of mediocrity, at\r\nthe expense of intellectual independence and social strength, has evolved,\r\nunder the aegis of England to her own satisfaction and advantage, until, at\r\nlast, she came to be admired by foreigners unblessed by so unique a\r\npossession. Hence the fiction of British freedom, hymned by harassed\r\noutlaws or academic critics, concerned only for the more obvious\r\nadvantages of a system which offered a refuge to the one and a guarantee\r\nof respectable stability to the other. When England was the safe haven for\r\ncontinental refugees, the admiring gratitude of the latter was untroubled\r\nby the reflection that it is one thing to harbour persons likely to cause\r\ntrouble with an immediate neighbour, whose frontier is invitingly near,\r\nand quite another to give them the shelter of insular isolation. Moreover,\r\nthe governments of more inflammable peoples, susceptible to the contagion\r\nof revolutionary ideas, cannot afford to take risks, which have no reality\r\nin the case of a people protected from that contagion by semi-education\r\nand an innate servility. Perhaps the greatest illusion of the last century\r\nhas been the innocent admiration of other nations for the security of a\r\nsystem which postulates a race inhibited by ignorance, snobbishness, and\r\nmal-nutrition, from all revolutionary desires. They envy the impunity\r\nwith which scandals, whose publication would elsewhere inspire\r\nassassination, if not revolution, may be revealed in the reports of Royal\r\nCommissions, without provoking more than a few columns of newspaper\r\nsummary and comment. But these benighted foreigners know the temper of\r\ntheir own populations too well not to pay them at least the compliment of\r\nbeing afraid to provoke popular fury. Blue Books and parliamentary\r\nquestions are not yet universally accepted substitutes for democratic\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe Irish people have more wisely adopted the ancient device, _oderint,\r\ndum metuant_, as the more intelligent attitude of a people towards its\r\nrulers, who have essayed in vain the process of demoralization so\r\neffective elsewhere. In Ireland alone the familiar ostentatious displays\r\nof Blue Book liberty fail in their purpose of disarming criticism, and\r\nconsigning vital questions to an oblivion of official words. The capacious\r\nand retentive Irish memory actually feeds on those indigestible slices of\r\nBritish freedom, whose price and mode of distribution render them\r\ninaccessible to the vast majority of taxpayers at whose expense these\r\nsepulchres of truth are constructed. The effect of such serious attention\r\nto utterances designed as soporifics is a profound contempt for precisely\r\nthat democratic virtue which has excited the admiration of certain\r\nforeigners, so consoling to the Anglo-Saxon sense of superiority. When the\r\nIrish-Irelander learns of England's claim to be the leader of democratic\r\nprogress in Europe, and finds that claim endorsed by apparently\r\ndisinterested critics, his instinctive movement is one of revulsion from\r\nall implied in the laudation. If English rule involves the acceptance of\r\nthe democratic ideal, then he rejects the ideal, for he knows that its\r\nirradiations have not lightened his political darkness, and its practical\r\nworkings have effected the ruin of his country. If democratization be\r\nsynonymous with anglicization, Ireland begs to be excused. She is,\r\ntherefore, thrown back upon herself, brooding and indifferent to the\r\nissues which convulse the peoples for whom the problems of the war have a\r\ndefinite meaning. This scepticism, however, does not bring Ireland into\r\ncontact with any current of internationalism, based upon a conviction of\r\neconomic evil existing in all capitalistic countries alike. The egoism of\r\nSinn Fein determines the Irish attitude towards the war. \"Ourselves\r\nalone,\" not German gold, determines Ireland's foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE SPLENDID ISOLATION OF SINN FEIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of the illusion of British liberty has been an obstacle to\r\nthe understanding of Ireland's problem for many years, and correspondingly\r\nthe Sinn Fein foreign policy is not a recent phenomenon, since its\r\nobjective has been the same for centuries as it is to-day. The French\r\ncritic, Emile Montegut, writing in 1855 of Mitchel's _Jail Journal_,\r\nadmitted the difficulty when he said: \"If the oppressor of Ireland were\r\nAustria or Russia, no invective, no anger, would suffice to denounce the\r\ninjustice and cruelty of the tyrant. Unhappily, the oppressor of Ireland\r\nis England, Protestant England, constitutional, liberal, industrial, and\r\ntrading England, the most accomplished type of the modern nation, the\r\nmodel of nineteenth century civilization.\" In recent times circumstances\r\nhave tended to correct and modify the enthusiasm of an opinion which has\r\nbeen fortified, nevertheless, by the current identification of British\r\ncommercial democracy with an ideal condition of society which must be\r\nprotected at all costs. The neutral world is blandly assured of the\r\nnecessity for accepting every humiliation, in view of the precious\r\nheritage at stake. The tacit, and often avowed, assumption is that the\r\nhuman race is deeply indebted to the noble altruism of the belligerents,\r\nwho have brought devastation and famine upon the world for the greater\r\nglory of civilization.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this Sinn Fein view of foreign affairs, the Irish\r\nthemselves are at a disadvantage in presenting their case, for again, it\r\nis a question of an unauthorized egoism, an egoism not upon the official\r\nschedule of edifying war-aims. Montegut became aware of this when he tried\r\nto diagnose John Mitchel as a revolutionary, who might expect the sympathy\r\nof Europe. \"The most anarchical Irishman,\" he wrote, \"the most fiery\r\npartisan of physical force is, in fact, less versed in liberal ideas than\r\nthe most obstinate monarchist on the Continent.\" As for John Mitchel, his\r\nFrench critic estimated him in terms which are as true of his disciples\r\nto-day as of the Young Ireland Movement and its predecessors. \"He is\r\nrevolutionary on the surface, in his accent and expression, but not in\r\nspirit or in principle\"; such was the judgment of the first impartial\r\nadmirer who was attracted to Mitchel by the purely literary qualities of\r\nthat masterpiece of passion and irony, _The Jail Journal_. The most\r\nlearned of the leaders of Sinn Fein, with a carelessness incredible in a\r\nprofessional historian, has tried to dismiss Emile Montegut as a hack\r\njournalist of the _Entente_! This sixty year old essay on John Mitchel\r\ncontains, nevertheless, a classic description of the Irish rebel, as he\r\nexists, and has always existed, to the discomfiture of those who do not\r\nappreciate the \"splendid isolation\" of the Sinn Fein idea. Summing up the\r\nYoung Ireland leader's attitude in foreign affairs, Montegut says:\r\n\r\n     \"Do not ask the author if he is Catholic, Liberal, or Republican, do\r\n     not ask what government he would give to Ireland. He hardly knows. He\r\n     does know that he hates England with all the forces of his soul, and\r\n     that he is ready to rebel against her on every occasion, and that\r\n     there is no party of which he is not prepared to declare himself the\r\n     defender, provided that England perish: French _sans-culottes_,\r\n     Austrian aristocrats, Russian despotism please him in turn. The\r\n     revolution of February drove him to revolt; but do not think that he\r\n     was consistent with himself, and that he was much afflicted by the\r\n     death of the Republic! Of all succeeding events he asks but one\r\n     thing; will they or will they not hurt England? Do they contain an\r\n     occasion for the humiliation of Carthage? He applauds Mazzini, the\r\n     enemy of Catholicism; likewise he would applaud an Ultramontane\r\n     Bishop of Ireland blessing the standards of a Celtic insurrection.\r\n     He salutes the French Republic with hope; but when on the pontoons of\r\n     Bermuda he learns of Louis Napoleon's election to the Presidency, he\r\n     gives a great shout of joy; on his arrival in America he learns the\r\n     news from the east, and he echoes the warlike trumpets of the Tsar\r\n     which resound on the Danube. In each of these events he hears the\r\n     good news: England's agony!\"\r\n\r\nEuropean history moves on, but Ireland's hymn of hate is still unaltered,\r\nand to its accompaniment Sinn Fein adapts the incidents, great and\r\ntrivial, which mark the progress of a conflict that is changing the world.\r\nCut off from the war by intellectual and geographical barriers, Ireland\r\nis, therefore, not exactly the most fruitful ground in which to sow the\r\nideas which have aroused to a frenzy all but a few disillusioned neutrals.\r\nThe pathetic dreams of Liberal forward-lookers, the pious platitudes of\r\nDr. Woodrow Wilson, and the prize-fighting rhetoric of embattled\r\nbureaucrats and newspapermen fall alike upon deaf Irish ears, which listen\r\nonly for the rending and cracking of an abhorred political system. To\r\nspeak of the sufferings of Belgians, Poles, and Serbians is merely to\r\nsuggest analogies from Irish history; the reaction to the stimulus of\r\natrocity-mongering is unexpected. Even the Russian revolution aroused only\r\na passive, almost academic interest, until Lenin and Trotsky referred\r\nspecifically to the question of Irish freedom. Then messages of\r\ncongratulation to the Bolsheviki were sent from those who had been openly\r\nsupporting Count Czernin in his amazing debate with the representatives of\r\nthe first Social Democracy to engage in diplomatic _pourparlers_ with a\r\nforeign power. But the capitalist press had scarcely published its\r\nexecration of Irish \"Bolshevism,\" when the Ukrainian peace was joyously\r\ngreeted by Sinn Fein spokesmen, who were unperturbed in their unholy\r\ninnocence of international capitalism, by the discreditable circumstances\r\nof that event, and its subsequently disintegrating effect upon Russia.\r\nThese patriots, as Montegut said of their forerunner, Mitchel, \"would\r\nunhesitatingly sacrifice modern civilization if there were no other means\r\nof striking England to the dust.\" Unfortunately, on this occasion, their\r\nignorance of the solidarity of the capitalist Internationalism betrayed\r\nthem into an easy acceptance of a situation by no means repugnant to the\r\naims of their adversaries. The defeat of Bolshevism was the first great\r\nAllied victory of the war, tempered only by the melancholy reflection that\r\nGermany would be the immediate beneficiary of this restoration of \"Law and\r\nOrder\"--that marvellous euphemism which covers a multitude of sins.\r\n\r\nIf the isolation of Ireland from European politics has stultified her\r\nerratic excursions into foreign affairs, it has even more seriously\r\naffected the political relations of England and Ireland during the past\r\nfour years. The Britisher, sympathetic or otherwise, is apparently quite\r\nincapable of realizing the fathomless indifference of the vast majority of\r\nthe Irish nation towards the issues of the present conflict in Europe.\r\nNaive Liberals have been heard inquiring with plaintive optimism: \"But\r\nsurely you Irish can appreciate the seriousness of a German victory, even\r\nif you are not willing to fight for England\"? And a look of incredulous\r\ndespair follows, when the composure of the Irishman is evidently\r\nundisturbed by the lurid tableau of the victorious super-Hun, composed for\r\nsceptics on such occasions. He usually is polite enough to convey to his\r\ninterlocutor his belief that no such triumph is possible for any of the\r\nbelligerents. This perfectly intelligible and essentially neutral attitude\r\nhas never failed to exasperate even more profoundly than pro-Germanism,\r\nthe legendary malady of all neutrals who fail to accept the Allies and\r\ntheir policies unreservedly. As it is those who themselves denounce the\r\nTreaties in which the real aims of the Allied \"democracies\" were secretly\r\nformulated who also insist with the greatest unction upon the moral\r\nsuperiority of the Allies, the embarrassment of the impartial is not\r\ndiminished by this demand upon their credulity.\r\n\r\nWhile one may expect the average man to put faith in his country \"right or\r\nwrong,\" he has exceeded the bounds of patriotic gregariousness when he\r\nasks foreigners to display an identical devotion. The imposition is all\r\nthe more intolerable when made, not by the plain man in the street, but by\r\nintellectuals, professing the use of reason. It is positively revolting to\r\nthe Irishman who, not being a citizen of those small nations happily\r\noutside the dominion of the belligerents, is prohibited from detailed\r\nneutral argument in defence of his own position. Denmark can speak through\r\na Georg Brandes, but Ireland may not even quote the Allied press in\r\nsupport of her contentions. The Irish case for neutrality is expurgated of\r\nnecessity--of military necessity! The possibilities of arriving at any\r\nunderstanding with the Allied countries have, therefore, been seriously\r\nhampered, apart altogether from the inherent obstacles to an admission on\r\nthe part of Anglo-Saxondom that its statecraft is not an admirable\r\ncombination of the choicest maxims of Holy Writ. Naturally, such\r\nconditions have in no wise modified the splendid isolation of Sinn Fein,\r\nsince they have rendered free intercommunication between Ireland and the\r\noutside world impossible.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate issue of this unequal debate, between a gagged nation and one\r\nin free possession of innumerable voices, was reached when those who\r\ntranscended mere discussion interposed with their policy of \"shoot: don't\r\nargue.\" The conscription of Irishmen is the logical conclusion to the\r\nsecular denial by England of the claims of Irish nationality, a denial\r\nwhich has ceased even to be expressed in specific words, so comfortably\r\nhas it sunk into the English sub-consciousness. This is the negation which\r\nunderlies all political discussion between English and Irish, and has not\r\na little to say in that futile debate already described. Since the\r\nIrishman's premises are not accepted, all his conclusions seem\r\nunreasonable to his opponent. Similarly the arguments of the latter; for\r\nthey rest upon a denial, or, at best, an academic recognition of the fact\r\nthat Ireland is a nation, with religious, social and cultural traditions\r\nas unlike those of England as the economic conditions of the two\r\ncountries are dissimilar. No agreement is likely when discussion is\r\nvitiated by so vital a misunderstanding. Hence the logic of the\r\nImperialists who shoot but don't argue. They know that Ireland is not a\r\ncolony, and thinking imperially, they are unwilling to concede rights\r\nwhich they grant to their colonial fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThis differentiation between colonials, who are Britishers, and Irishmen\r\nwho are not, does not lead to its corollary that Ireland is a nation, for\r\nit is not the Anglo-Saxon habit to admit unpleasant truths, unpleasant\r\nhere, because the admission would weaken the \"moral\" case for\r\nconscription, so dear to the British heart. The brutal Hun may dispense\r\nwith moral sanctions, he may admit his wrong-doing, when military\r\nnecessity involves the invasion of neutral territory. The German\r\nsheep--for we are assured of his docility--may masquerade in the wolf's\r\nclothing of intellectual honesty, his adversaries must have some law (of\r\n\"angary\"), or preferably, some text of Scripture, enjoining them to act as\r\nthey have decided. Their wisdom is justified by the universal execration\r\nof Prussianism which, under other names, smells quite sweet.\r\nUnfortunately, Ireland, like other small neutrals, has failed to be\r\nimpressed by the ingenious variety of the Imperialist technique, whose\r\nresults are monotonously the same. In the particular instance of the\r\nproposal to apply conscription to Ireland, it is hard to say which\r\nattitude in the Englishman is the more preposterous from the Irish point\r\nof view: that of the virtuosi of Imperialism, who insist upon their moral\r\n\"right\" to conscript, or that of the soothsayers of liberalism, who think\r\nit \"inexpedient\" to impose upon the Irish colony a claim which they dared\r\nnot impose on Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. Both are\r\nobnoxious in so far as they rest upon the \"great refusal,\" the negation of\r\nIrish nationality.\r\n\r\nIt happens, however, that a corresponding divergence of opinion has\r\nexpressed itself in Ireland to meet the conditions of British politics.\r\nConstitutional Nationalists and not wholly degraded Unionists have met the\r\nargument of inexpediency by adopting it, obeying the law of their\r\nparliamentary being, which demands cohesion with political friends in\r\nEngland. This section protests, therefore, against the attempt to enforce\r\na theoretical right which was not exercised in the case of the British\r\ncolonies. If logic were any part of a politician's equipment this position\r\nwould be untenable, since only the Unionists profess to regard themselves\r\nas Colonials. The Nationalists assert that Ireland is a nation, but they\r\nact as if she were a colony, thereby adding to the incongruity of their\r\nrevolt against participation in a war which they have supported and\r\ndeclared to be just. But happily only their illogical opponents insist\r\nupon the logical weakness of the position, as is the practice in politics,\r\nwhere the beam in the eye of one party never interferes with its\r\nperception of the mote in the eye of the other. Their respective\r\nconstituents are quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein, on the other hand, rejects contemptuously the theory of\r\ninexpediency (while admitting the fact), and prefers to deal with the\r\nBritisher _in excelsis_, whose proposal is felt to be a declaration of war\r\nby one nation against another. The failure of England to regard the\r\nRepublican army of 1916 as military prisoners of war is not felt to be a\r\nweak link in the logic of this reasoning--a very human exhibition of that\r\npolitical blindness to which reference has been made. The Sinn Fein\r\ncontention is that Ireland is under no obligation to take part in the\r\nEuropean conflict, and that even a measure of Colonial Home Rule should\r\nnot involve a departure from this attitude of neutrality. It is argued,\r\nsimultaneously, that the war is no concern of the Irish people, and that\r\nIreland is one of the most important strategic factors of the\r\nAnglo-German struggle, owing to her geographical position. In short, the\r\ndestiny of Ireland is to be largely determined by the outcome of the\r\npresent hostilities, but the country itself is to remain outside and above\r\nthe battle--a sort of ideal war aim, suspended _in vacuo_, and knowing\r\nnone of the evils which normally befall small countries when they lie\r\nacross the path of great empires. The ingenuous egoism of this viewpoint\r\nis, of course, obvious, and perhaps irritating, to the unsympathetic\r\noutsider, but it is neither better nor worse than the logic of the various\r\nPowers, great and small, whose national egoisms have been touched by the\r\nwar. Every country affected is convinced that its particular existence and\r\nambitions must be assured, if the true purpose of the war is to be\r\nachieved. All see in the satisfaction of their respective aspirations a\r\nguarantee of the millenium, and the triumph of Freedom, Justice and\r\nHumanity.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of appeals to reason, addressed to nations unbalanced by\r\nfear and desire, has never been more apparent than to-day. With the tissue\r\nof patriotic idealism worn threadbare, exposing ugly national greeds,\r\nself-complacent incompetence, and shameless commercialism, it would seem\r\nincredible that even the mob mind should not revolt. Yet, it is just at\r\nthis supreme moment of disillusion, when the showing up of all\r\nbelligerents is complete, that voices are heard clamouring for more\r\nsoldiers to fight for Liberty, and the more incurable professors of\r\nDemocracy--that blessed word--actually suggest that the true significance\r\nof the war should be explained to an ignorant Ireland. Once our darkness\r\nwas lightened by the lords of propaganda we would take our places, not in\r\nthe rear as become late-comers, but in the forefront of the great crusade,\r\nwhich is to restore to France her frontier of 1814, to allocate the Balkan\r\nStates to various masters, to partition Turkey, and rearrange the economic\r\nand geographical map, to the greater glory of the Allied God. To say the\r\nleast, the moment is not quite propitious to the cultivation of the\r\nnecessary faith in people living, politically, _in partibus infidelium_.\r\nIt is no wonder that the Irish nation, without introspection of motive,\r\nhas united in opposition to the application of a law which could never\r\nhave established itself, if it had been born into a world as sceptical as\r\nthat of to-day. Illusion or panic must urge the duty of compulsory\r\nmilitary service.\r\n\r\nThe ruthless Sinn Fein policy of the English in Ireland called forth an\r\nequivalent Irish retort. Sinn Fein with its programme of national\r\neconomics, has its roots in the history of the commercial relations\r\nbetween the two countries. From 1663, when the Cattle and Navigation Acts\r\nlaid the first avowed restrictions on Irish industry and commerce, down to\r\nthe present, the destruction of the economic, in addition to the national,\r\nfreedom of Ireland, has been the deliberate policy of Britain. The\r\nprogramme of industrial revival, the plea for industrial autonomy, which\r\nwas the point of departure for Sinn Fein many years ago, what is it, after\r\nall, but the crystallization of ideas common to three centuries of Irish\r\neconomic literature? From the beginning of the seventeenth century a vast\r\nlibrary of protest against English commercial jealousy has grown up, and\r\nis still growing. Obscure pamphleteers and writers of the highest fame\r\nstand side by side in this indictment of a country which dares now to\r\nassert that its crimes have not been deliberate. Swift's _Proposal for the\r\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures_, his _Short View of the State of\r\nIreland_, his _Modest Proposal_; the _Querist_ of Bishop Berkeley; Hely\r\nHutchinson's _Commercial Restraints of Ireland_;--these are only some of\r\nthe most prominent documents in the history of the economic revolt,\r\nsubsequently known as the Sinn Fein movement. A sharp corrective of the\r\nlazy ignorance of the fiction which describes the Irish case against\r\nEngland as one of retrospective sentimentality is provided by the economic\r\nwritings of Irishmen for the past three hundred years.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein succeeds Sinn Fein; one egoism has aroused another, and England\r\nnow faces in Ireland the projection of her own spirit. Just as British\r\npolicy has served only England's interests, so Ireland has learnt to think\r\nfirst of herself, having never seen her enemy give one thought even to\r\nfair play, as between country and country. Whatever claims the British\r\nEmpire may have upon the gratitude or self-interest of other peoples, it\r\nhas none on Ireland, which has not yet been allowed, as the phrase goes,\r\nto be just before she is generous. The sacred egoism of nations, so\r\ncommendable when urging them to fight for their national existence--and\r\neven aggrandisement--against the Hun, is unfavourably regarded in all\r\nother circumstances. Neither Russia nor Greece has been pardoned a natural\r\nimpulse towards self-preservation. Only great Powers are allowed to think\r\nof their own welfare; small nations are denied the luxury, except on\r\nspecified conditions. Yet, in spite of brute force, and perhaps because of\r\nit, the smaller nationalities persist in a tenacious selfishness, without\r\nwhich they must abandon the struggle for life. Editors of military age,\r\nwho are too proud of their verbiage to fight, may lament the shame of a\r\npeople incapable of the noble altruism which fights for the Sacred\r\nTreaties. Even if a miracle of democracy in the Allied ranks had not come\r\nto give us those shreds of the truth behind the war, Ireland would still\r\nremain unconscious of her shameless soullessness. Strong in the sacred\r\negoism of Sinn Fein, the Irish nation is convinced that only in his own\r\ncountry can an Irishman usefully engage in the struggle for freedom.\r\nFlanders, Gallipoli, and Mesopotamia are not milestones on the road which\r\nleads to the liberation of at least one forgotten small nationality.\r\n\r\nIf the anti-conscription movement had not asserted itself pious Liberal\r\nphrase-makers would never have believed--British fashion--that any\r\ncommunity could actually stand by principles whose statement in England\r\nhas invariably been a preliminary to their ignominious abandonment. Once\r\nagain our political realism impinged unpleasantly upon the Anglo-Saxon\r\nconsciousness, confronting the impotent mourners of theories they were too\r\nfeeble to defend with the spectacle of a people aroused to fight against\r\nthe supreme sacrifice demanded by the State of its citizens. The sacred\r\negoism of the individual and of the nation was challenged, and a sacred\r\nunion was the result, in which Ireland asserted, with uncompromising\r\nunanimity, her separate national identity. Characteristically, the\r\nprofessional Protestants kept aloof from this manifestation of liberty, to\r\nthe bewilderment and shame of certain continental observers, proud of\r\ntheir Calvinistic origins, and surprised to find that, in Ireland,\r\nProtestantism is, by definition, antagonistic to the libertarian impulses\r\nwith which it is associated on the continent of Europe. An aftermath of\r\ntragi-comedy followed the religious tension of the anti-conscription\r\ndemonstrations, when a number of Protestant Irishwomen were contemptuously\r\nexcluded from the church in which they had intended to associate their\r\nprayers with those of their Catholic countrywomen. They discovered that\r\nthe Church of \"Ireland\" denied them the elementary right of every\r\nProtestant to direct communication with God. The Dean who interposed\r\nbetween heaven and the prayers of the faithful was not, strange to say,\r\ninvited to enter the communion which teaches the necessity for priestly\r\nintercession between man and his Maker. On the contrary, some of the\r\nvictims of his ecclesiastical and political insolence were more concerned\r\nto absolve him from the blame of such an insult than to assert the\r\nprinciple for which Irish Protestants were alleged to be fighting. Such is\r\nthe dilemma, and such is the quality, of the religion implanted by England\r\nin this country, and fostered, like the weakling that it is, in all the\r\npeevish selfishness of the spoilt child, eternally exerting the petty\r\ntyrannies it imputes to others.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of Anglo-Saxondom to this Irish experiment in the teaching of\r\nthe Allies has been somewhat similar to that described in the case of\r\nRussia, on the analogous occasion of the revolutionary realization of\r\ntheories reserved for the academic leisure of the English upper classes.\r\nMr. Lloyd George, that distinguished Liberal, was most insistent upon the\r\n\"moral right\" to impose military service upon subject races, his\r\ncontention was echoed by all \"responsible\" statesmen, and the lofty\r\nexample of Austria was cited as a model. This was a daring instance of\r\nassociating with enemy ideas, only permissible to the chemically pure in\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIf only the Hun had served the Bible as he served Bernhardi, the Lord\r\nwould not have deserted him in his hour of need. In Ireland, however, the\r\ndevil of imperialism quoted the Scriptures to no purpose, for this is an\r\nisland, not only of Saints and Scholars, but also of theologians and\r\npoliticians, who proved equal to this ingenious conflict of moralities.\r\nThis alliance was particularly obnoxious to those who had engineered the\r\npolitico-religious Carsonade of North-East Ulster. Just as the Allied\r\ngovernments have standardized the business of rescuing small\r\nnationalities, so the dominant British statesmen have the exclusive right\r\nto combine religion and politics. A Covenant of \"loyalists,\" in full\r\nProtestant regalia, organizing treason to the King and Parliament\r\nrecognized by them, is but an incident on the path to political preferment\r\nand the honours of public life. A national pledge to resist the greatest\r\ninfamy one nation can inflict upon another becomes a Papist plot. An Irish\r\nbishop is a sinister intruder only when he does not wear the shovel-hat\r\nand apron of the Episcopalian minority.\r\n\r\nIn the greater Anglo-Saxondom across the seas, particularly in the\r\nWilsonian Republic, the spectacle of Irish freedom was most offensive. An\r\nAmerican critic once summed up the different characteristics of North and\r\nSouth in the Civil War by saying: \"The Southerner was an imitation of an\r\nEnglish gentleman, the Northerner was an imitation of an English cad.\" In\r\nother words, society in the South was a shadowy reflection of the British\r\nlanded aristocracy, in the North, it followed the example of the\r\ncapitalist class. In terms of present day America this definition must be\r\nmodified to meet the change effected by the triumph of the North, and the\r\ngeneral disappearance of the old South. An American to-day is an English\r\nLiberal ... only more so. He combines the anti-social commercialism of the\r\nindustrial early nineteenth century with the empty, verbal radicalism of\r\nthe Cocoa Press tear-squeezers. Needless to say he has shown, on the\r\nwhole, a more ferocious intolerance of minorities and individuals than any\r\nother belligerent in the present war. His hatred is more bestial; his\r\npatriotic zeal more inquisitorial. The slowly mounting tide of perverted\r\nPuritan legislation has broken over America, swollen by the tributaries of\r\nwar lust, until the country is a vast wilderness of freak prohibitions\r\naimed at the destruction of freedom. In these circumstances it is not\r\nsurprising to find American journals occasionally protesting against the\r\nexcessive zeal of the Administration in suppressing opinions and harassing\r\nindividuals, because of pro-Irish sympathies which have been granted\r\nexpression even in England. The New York _Nation_, a respectable and\r\northodox journal, written by and for intellectually anaemic college\r\nprofessors, sighs in vain for such toleration in Irish affairs as that of\r\nthe _Manchester Guardian_. A striking tribute to the decadent\r\nanglicization of the Benighted States!\r\n\r\nAt no time remarkable for the suppression of the national ego, America has\r\nnow abandoned all pretence of respecting the egoism of other nations which\r\nhave dared to display the instinct of self-preservation, in opposition to\r\nthe ukases of absolutists of international virtue. Thus, we find the great\r\nminds of the Anglo-Saxon world with but a single thought, although\r\nforward-lookers in England still comfort their depressed followers with\r\ngallant attempts to extract hope from the rhetorical felicities of\r\nPresident Wilson, whose verbal harmonies are contrasted with the\r\ndiscordant defiance of ministerial utterances at home. Just as in America,\r\nprogressive Radicals compare the autocracy of Washington with the\r\ndemocracy of London, and complain that Americans are deprived of the\r\nblessings of liberty and efficiency which the English enjoy. The great\r\nadvantage of a numerous Alliance may be appreciated by all who observe the\r\nreciprocal illusions of the Allied peoples, of whom each believes that all\r\nis well with the others. An idea, or a reputation, exploded in London,\r\nwill linger peacefully in more distant regions, until the circuit of\r\ndisillusionment has been completed. By that time it may start afresh in\r\nsome new guise, on the principle that you can pass as a statesman of\r\ngenius with all the Allies some of the time, if not with some of them all\r\nthe time, as certain idols of the market place would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nWhen the collapsible German \"plot\" was landed in Ireland, and a number of\r\narrests was made in the better-organized ranks of the\r\nanti-conscriptionists, it was doubtless the intention to prove Irish\r\nNationalism synonymous with pro-Germanism, but the result has been to make\r\nit so, rather than to prove that it was so. This unexpected achievement\r\nhas been pointed out--the Censor permitting--in various journals, and\r\nthere has been a consequent recrudescence of activity to persuade Ireland\r\nthat she is isolating herself from the world by turning towards Germany.\r\nWith a tranquility in accepting the possibility as strange as the\r\ndisinclination to remove its motives, Englishmen have set themselves to\r\nargue against the desirability of an Irish-German alliance. That being a\r\nhighly conjectural and theoretical matter, it at once appeals to the\r\nLiberal British mind as a more suitable theme for discussion than the\r\nactual question at issue between England and Ireland. The Celt, whose\r\npreference for the dream over the reality is proverbial in non-Celtic\r\ncircles, has been superseded by the theorists of freedom, who would much\r\nsooner argue academic points than face real political problems. They enjoy\r\nthe task of setting forth the dire consequences of a Central European\r\ncombination, with Ireland annexed, and contrasting this with the\r\nfederation of free peoples, in which everyone is happy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the future does not present itself to the Irish mind in any\r\nsuch simplified terms, and some Irishmen, too, offer the will for the deed\r\nof participation, but their reception is the most unfavourable. They are\r\naccused of supporting a war in which they refuse to fight. There is to be\r\nno reciprocity in this exchange. The pro-Ally Irishman is to give his life\r\nat once, but no instalment is forthcoming of the common ideal he has been\r\ninvited to achieve. The democratic millenium to which the Milners,\r\nCurzons, and Carsons are leading, under the special patronage of Lord\r\nNorthcliffe, is apparently so certain, that only the rudeness of parochial\r\nand provincial minds could prompt a demand for the commonplace\r\nrealizations of here and now. So it comes, as the war progresses, that\r\nthe number of Ireland's grievances is increased simultaneously with the\r\ndemands upon her honour, her credulity and her patience. Consequently, as\r\nis the way of human nature, her egoism is exasperated, and becomes more\r\nfirmly concentrated upon her own welfare. Precisely at that moment of\r\nexasperation an appeal is made for the voluntary surrender of that which\r\nwas witheld even under threat of force. Since it is only the tactless Hun\r\nwho is lacking in psychological subtlety, this strange phenomenon must be\r\notherwise explicable.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that our sacred egoism, strong and exacerbated as it is, has\r\nnot yet touched the sublime heights of British selfishness and\r\nself-complacency. England refuses absolutely to be convinced, by the\r\npainful and reiterated facts of our history, that this country is not\r\nmerely a turbulent province! Therefore, it ought to be possible to break\r\nour resistance, or to cajole us, as was done in England when the various\r\nMilitary Service Acts were passed. The men of the country were split up\r\ninto antagonistic groups; the married against the single, the middle-aged\r\nagainst the young, trade against trade. Each wanted to escape at the cost\r\nof the other. In Ireland, of course, no such division can be created, for\r\nthe simple reason that we have never refused to fight for our own\r\ncountry. Our detestation of pacifists equals even that of the English\r\ngutter-press, and our incredible indifference to personal, as distinct\r\nfrom national, convictions makes Ireland a paradise for militarists. But\r\nthey must be militarists of our own creation. Sinn Fein fosters the\r\ndevelopment of native industries, and supports home products, often with\r\nan embarrassing disregard for the consequences. The Irish anti-militarist\r\nis, therefore, rarely a pacifist, and his objections are of a very\r\ndifferent order from those which are surmounted or crushed by the\r\nadvocates of military service in Great Britain. But it does not seem as if\r\nthis elementary fact will be recognized, for to recognize it would be for\r\nEngland to admit that Ireland is a nation. To the denial and obscuration\r\nof that enduring truth centuries of English policy have gone, and in\r\nIreland everything has been sacrificed to its assertion and reiteration.\r\nIt lies at the back of the whole Anglo-Irish controversy, and sums up the\r\nessence of innumerable volumes which have attempted to state the case for\r\nIrish freedom. Until the fact of Irish Nationality is accepted by England,\r\nand acted upon, it will be the task of Sinn Fein to proclaim the sacred\r\negoism of a nation that will not die.",
