For the most part, the descriptions are given in the\r\nsame words which I wrote down at the time, either for my own memory or\r\nfor the newspaper. But the whole has been re-arranged and rewritten,\r\nwhile certain scenes have been added for which a daily paper has\r\nno room. I have also inserted between the scenes a bare outline of\r\nthe principal events that were happening elsewhere, so that the\r\nsignificance of what I saw may be more easily understood, and the dates\r\nbecome something better than mere numbers.\r\n\r\nBut to realize the meaning of the earlier chapters, a further\r\nintroduction is necessary, and it is difficult to know where to begin.\r\nFor there is never any real break in a nation’s history from day to\r\nday, and the movement of 1905 was not the first sign of change, but\r\nonly the brightest. The story of the undaunted struggle for freedom\r\nin Russia during the last fifty years has been admirably told by\r\nStepniak, Kropotkin, Zilliacus, Miliukoff, and many other writers. In\r\nbooks that are easily obtained, any one may learn the course of that\r\ngreat movement--the changes in its aims and methods, the distinctions\r\nin its parties, and the martyrdoms of its recorded heroes. So for this\r\npresent purpose of chronicling a few peculiar or unnoticed events and\r\nsituations which would hardly have a place in history at all, perhaps\r\nit will be enough if I begin the skeleton annals with the outbreak of\r\nthe war between Russia and Japan in February, 1904.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A DEMONSTRATION BY THE KAZAN CHURCH, ST. PETERSBURG.\r\n\r\n   From _The Marseillaise_.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that for some time earlier the revolutionary movement\r\nhad obviously been gathering strength. Within two years there had\r\noccurred outbreaks among the peasants, student risings in Moscow, and\r\na demonstration in front of the great classic building called the\r\nKazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Some soldiers at Toula had actually\r\nrefused to kill the work-people. The Zemstvos, or District Councils of\r\nlandowners and upper-middle classes, had ventured to recommend economic\r\nreforms, and a student from Kieff had assassinated Sipiaguine, the\r\nMinister of the Interior. To counteract these evils, heightened by\r\na period of industrial depression, Plehve had been promoted from the\r\nGovernorship of Finland to the Ministry of the Interior; a manifesto\r\nhad been issued (March 12, 1903), removing the responsibility of the\r\nvillage communes for individual taxation, and promoting religious\r\ntoleration; and the Jews of Kishineff had been massacred, with the\r\nconnivance of the Government, and probably at its direct instigation\r\n(April 20, 1903). The Armenian Church in the Caucasus was deprived\r\nof £3,000,000 of its funds, the public debt of Russia rose to\r\n£700,000,000, about half of the interest on which had to be paid to\r\nforeign countries, and Witte was appointed President of the Committee\r\nof Ministers, while his assistant Pleske succeeded him in what was then\r\nregarded as the far more important position of the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that the Government--which we may call Tsardom or\r\nOligarchy as we please--had in any case entered upon the way to\r\ndestruction, and that the revolution was already at work. Indeed, the\r\nSocial Democrats had met in secret in 1903, and published a “minimum\r\nprogramme” demanding a Republic under universal adult suffrage. But\r\nstill the disastrous war with Japan hastened these tendencies, and its\r\noutbreak may conveniently be taken to mark a period, for the dates of\r\nwars are definite and the results quick.\r\n\r\nThe course of that ruinous campaign, unequalled, I suppose, in history\r\nfor the uninterrupted succession of its disasters, need not concern\r\nus now. It wasted many millions of money, borrowed by a country which\r\nis naturally and inevitably poor. It revealed an incompetence in the\r\nruling classes worse than our own in South Africa, together with a\r\ncorruption and a heartlessness of greed compared to which even the\r\nscandals of South Africa seemed rather less devilish. It kept from\r\ntheir work in fields and factories about a million grown men, who had\r\nto be fed and clothed, however badly, by the rest of the population,\r\nand it killed or maimed some two or three hundred thousand of them.\r\nOtherwise the war can hardly be said to have concerned the Russian\r\npeople any more than ourselves, so general was their indifference\r\nboth to its cause and to its failure. “It is not our war, it is the\r\nGovernment’s affair,” was the common saying. Tolstoy is a prophet,\r\nand the mark of a prophet is that he speaks with the voice of God\r\nand not with the voice of the people; but in his protest against the\r\nwar (published in the _Times_ of June 27, 1904) he uttered a\r\ndenunciation of the Government with which nearly the whole of Russia’s\r\npopulation would have agreed. Of the head of that Government himself,\r\nhe wrote:--\r\n\r\n   “The Russian Tsar, the same man who exhorted all the nations in\r\n   the cause of peace, publicly announces that, notwithstanding\r\n   all his efforts to maintain the peace so dear to his heart\r\n   (efforts which express themselves in the seizing of other\r\n   people’s lands and in the strengthening of armies for the\r\n   defence of those stolen lands), he, owing to the attack of the\r\n   Japanese, commands that the same should be done to the Japanese\r\n   as they had begun doing to the Russians--namely, that they\r\n   should be slaughtered; and in announcing this call to murder he\r\n   mentions God, asking the Divine blessing on the most dreadful\r\n   crime in the world. This unfortunate and entangled young man,\r\n   recognized as the leader of 130,000,000 of people, continually\r\n   deceived and compelled to contradict himself, confidently thanks\r\n   and blesses the troops which he calls his own for murder in\r\n   defence of lands which he calls his own with still less right.”\r\n\r\nWhile the myth of Russia’s military and naval power--a myth which\r\nfor fifty years had misguided England’s foreign policy, checked any\r\ngenerous impulse on the part of our statesmen, and driven them to\r\nbreach of national faith, callousness towards outrageous cruelty,\r\nand every moral humiliation that a proud and ancient people can\r\nsuffer--while this overwhelming myth was being dissipated month by\r\nmonth in the Far East, the characteristic methods by which the Russian\r\nTsar and Oligarchs sought to maintain their hold upon the wealth and\r\nprivileges of State were being revealed in the so-called Königsberg\r\ncase. It was discovered that even in a foreign capital like Berlin, the\r\nRussian Government employed a little army of spies, under a recognized\r\nand highly-paid official, to search the homes of Russian Liberals, to\r\nwatch their goings, and open their letters. It was also shown that,\r\neven under a comparatively civilized government like the German,\r\nthe authorities were ready to bring their own subjects to trial for\r\nalleged verbal attacks upon the Tsar; while a Russian Consul, probably\r\nin obedience to orders from home, would tell any lie and garble any\r\ndocument to support the charge.\r\n\r\nOn June 17th the air was cleared by the assassination of General\r\nBobrikoff, the Russian tyrant of Finland, and on July 8th that deed\r\nwas followed by the assassination of Plehve. In all the history of\r\npolitical murder, I suppose, there has never been a case in which the\r\nvictim received less pity, or the crime less condemnation. The pitiless\r\nhand of reaction was for the moment stayed. The birth of an heir to the\r\nuneasy crown inspired the Tsar with such amiability that, as father\r\nof his people, he abolished the punishment of flogging among his\r\ngrown-up subjects. Prince Sviatopolk Mirski, who was justly regarded as\r\nsomething of a Liberal as princes go, succeeded Plehve at the Interior,\r\nreleased some political prisoners, advocated decentralization with the\r\ndevelopment of the Zemstvos, and promised better education, liberty of\r\nconscience, and freedom of speech.\r\n\r\nAgain the Zemstvoists, taking their courage as moderate Liberals\r\nin both hands, met secretly in St. Petersburg, and drew up a kind\r\nof Petition of Rights to be presented to the Tsar. There were one\r\nhundred and six members present at the secret conferences, thirty-six\r\nof them belonging to the caste of the nobility, and their Petition\r\nbegan with the complaint that the bureaucracy had alienated the people\r\nfrom the Throne, and that by its distrust of self-government it had\r\nshown itself entirely out of touch with the people. In place of the\r\nbureaucratic system, the Petition demanded an elected Legislature of\r\ntwo Houses, together with freedom of conscience, the press, meeting,\r\nand association, equal civil and political rights for all classes and\r\nraces, and similar methods of justice for the peasants as for other men.\r\n\r\nThe Zemstvo petition was issued on November 22, 1904. A month later\r\n(December 26th) it was repeated in still more direct and urgent terms\r\nby the Moscow Zemstvo, which had always taken the lead in reform, being\r\ninspired by its President, Prince Sergius Troubetzkoy, Professor of\r\nPhilosophy in the University since 1888. But, in the meantime, student\r\nriots had again occurred in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the censorship\r\nhad been renewed, and on the same day as the Moscow petition there\r\nappeared an Imperial manifesto proclaiming “the unshakable foundations\r\nof the Russian State system, consecrated by the fundamental laws of\r\nthe Empire,” and announcing the Tsar’s determination to act always in\r\naccordance with the revered will of his crowned predecessor, while he\r\nthought unceasingly upon the welfare of the realm entrusted to him by\r\nGod. The manifesto went on to admit that when the need of this or that\r\nchange had been proved to be mature, the Tsar was willing to take it\r\ninto consideration, and upon this principle he undertook to maintain\r\nthe laws, to give local institutions as wide a scope as possible, to\r\nunify judicial procedure throughout the Empire, to establish State\r\ninsurance of workmen, and to revise the laws upon political crime,\r\nreligious offences, and the press. But the tone of the whole manifesto\r\nwas felt to be reactionary, and there was no guarantee that its\r\npromises would be observed. When our own Charles I. made concessions,\r\nthe people shouted, “We have the word of a King!” But they soon found\r\nthat assurance was a shifty thing to trust to, and since then the words\r\nof kings have counted for no more than the words of men.\r\n\r\nBut the opening of the next year (1905) was marked by the appearance\r\nof a new element in revolution. Certainly, there had been strikes and\r\nriots in the great cities before; there had been peasant risings and\r\nother forms of economic agitation in various parts. But as a whole the\r\nrevolutionary movement as such had been inspired, directed, and even\r\ncarried out by the educated classes--the students, the journalists, the\r\ndoctors, barristers, and other professional men. It had been almost\r\nlimited to that great division of society which in Russia is called\r\n“The Intelligence.” The word is fairly well represented by our phrase\r\n“educated classes”--a phrase which embodies our greatest national\r\nshame. It includes all who are not workmen or peasants, and so is much\r\nwider in significance than the French term “The Intellectuals,” with\r\nwhich it is often confused. In England, for instance, it would include\r\nthe House of Lords, the clergy, army officers, country gentlemen, and\r\nthe leaders of society whom no Frenchman would dream of classing among\r\nthe intellectual.\r\n\r\nIt was “the Intelligence” who hitherto had fought for the revolution.\r\nIt was they who had suffered scourgings and exile and imprisonment and\r\nmadness and violation and the gallows in the name of freedom. It was\r\nthey who had endured the horror that most people feel in killing a man.\r\nAnd, above all, it was they who had devoted their lives, their careers,\r\nand reputations to going about among the peasants and working-people\r\nto show them that the misery and terror under which they lived were\r\nneither necessary nor universal. At length the firstfruits of their\r\ntoilsome propaganda, continued through forty years, were seen, and the\r\nrevolutionary workman appeared.\r\n\r\nHe was ushered in by Father George Gapon, at that time a rather\r\nsimple-hearted priest, with a rather childlike faith in God and the\r\nTsar, and a certain genius for organization. His personal hold upon the\r\nworking classes was probably due to their astonishment that a priest\r\nshould take any interest in their affairs, outside their fees. We have\r\nseen the same thing happen in England, when Manning and Westcott won\r\nthe reverence due to saints because they displayed some feeling for the\r\nflock which they were paid large sums to protect. Father Gapon, with\r\nhis thin line of genius for organization, had gathered the workmen’s\r\ngroups or trade unions of St. Petersburg into a fairly compact body,\r\ncalled “The Russian Workmen’s Union,” of which he was President as\r\nwell as founder. In the third week in January the men at the Putiloff\r\niron works struck because two of their number had been dismissed for\r\nbelonging to their union. At once the Neva iron and ship-building\r\nworks, the Petroffsky cotton works, the Alexander engine works, the\r\nThornton cloth works, and other great factories on the banks of the\r\nriver or upon the industrial islands joined in the strike, and in two\r\ndays some 100,000 work-people were “out.”\r\n\r\nWith his rather childlike faith in God and the Tsar, Father Gapon\r\norganized a dutiful appeal of the Russian workmen to the tender-hearted\r\nautocrat whose benevolence was only thwarted by evil counsellors and\r\nhis ignorance of the truth. The petition ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n   “We workmen come to you for truth and protection. We have\r\n   reached the extreme limits of endurance. We have been exploited,\r\n   and shall continue to be exploited under your bureaucracy.\r\n\r\n   “The bureaucracy has brought the country to the verge of ruin\r\n   and by a shameful war is bringing it to its downfall. We have\r\n   no voice in the heavy burdens imposed on us. We do not even\r\n   know for whom or why this money is wrung from the impoverished\r\n   people, and we do not know how it is expended. This is contrary\r\n   to the Divine laws, and renders life impossible. It is better\r\n   that we should all perish, we workmen and all Russia. Then good\r\n   luck to the capitalists and exploiters of the poor, the corrupt\r\n   officials and robbers of the Russian people!\r\n\r\n   “Throw down the wall that separates you from your people. Russia\r\n   is too great and her needs are too various for officials to\r\n   rule. National representation is essential, for the people alone\r\n   know their own needs.\r\n\r\n   “Direct that elections for a constituent assembly be held by\r\n   general secret ballot. That is our chief petition. Everything is\r\n   contained in that.\r\n\r\n   “If you do not reply to our prayer, we will die in this square\r\n   before your palace. We have nowhere else to go. Only two paths\r\n   are open to us--to liberty and happiness or to the grave. Should\r\n   our lives serve as the offering of suffering Russia, we shall\r\n   not regret the sacrifice, but endure it willingly.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sunday, January 22, 1905, about 15,000 working men\r\nand women formed into a procession to carry this petition to the Tsar\r\nin his Winter Palace upon the great square of government buildings.\r\nThey were all in their Sunday clothes; many peasants had come up from\r\nthe country in their best embroideries; they took their children with\r\nthem. In front marched Father Gapon and two other priests wearing\r\nvestments. With them went the ikons, or holy pictures of shining\r\nbrass and silver, and a portrait of the Tsar. As the procession moved\r\nalong, they sang, “God save our people. God give our Orthodox Tsar the\r\nvictory.”\r\n\r\nSo the Russian workmen made their last appeal to the autocrat whom they\r\ncalled their father. They would lay their griefs before him, they would\r\nsee him face to face, they would hear his comforting words.\r\n\r\nBut the father of his people had disappeared into space.\r\n\r\nAs the procession entered the square, the soldiers fired volley after\r\nvolley upon them from three sides. The estimate of the killed and\r\nwounded was about 1500. That Sunday--January 9th in Russian style--is\r\nknown as Bloody Sunday or Vladimir’s Day, after the Grand Duke\r\nVladimir, who was supposed to have given the orders.\r\n\r\nNext morning Father Gapon wrote to his Union: “There is no Tsar now.\r\nInnocent blood has flowed between him and the people.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “HOMUNCULUS” AND THE S. D. (SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC) RATS.\r\n\r\n   From _Burelom_ (_The Storm_).]\r\n\r\nInnocent blood has flowed before and tyrants still have reigned. They\r\nhave been feared, they have won their way, and men have served them.\r\nMankind will endure much in the name of government, but to be\r\ngoverned by a coward is almost beyond the endurance of man.\r\n\r\nOn January 24th a new office of Governor-General of St. Petersburg was\r\ncreated, and Trepoff received the first appointment.\r\n\r\nDisturbances continued in Warsaw, Lodz, and Sosnowice, the industrial\r\ncentres of Poland, and on January 31st 200 work-people were killed and\r\n600 wounded in the streets of Warsaw.\r\n\r\nOn February 17th the Grand Duke Sergius, Governor-General of Moscow,\r\nuncle to the Tsar, conspicuous for his cruelty, and, even among the\r\nRussian aristocracy, renowned for the peculiarity of his vices, was\r\nassassinated as he drove into the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nThis event and other outbreaks that were continually occurring in the\r\ngreat centres of industry, inspired a remarkable manifesto and rescript\r\nthat appeared on March 3rd and were characteristic of the hesitating\r\nfugitive in Tsarkoe Selo. The manifesto took the form of a pathetic\r\naddress to the people whom he had misgoverned with such disaster:--\r\n\r\n   “Disturbances have broken out in our country” (it said) “to the\r\n   joy of our enemies and our own deep sorrow. Blinded by pride,\r\n   the evil-minded leaders of the revolutionary movement make\r\n   insolent attacks upon the Holy Orthodox Church and the lawfully\r\n   established pillars of the Russian State....\r\n\r\n   “We humbly bear the trial sent us by Providence, and derive\r\n   strength and consolation from our firm trust in the grace\r\n   which God has always shown to the Russian power, and from the\r\n   immemorial devotion which we know our loyal people entertain for\r\n   the Throne....\r\n\r\n   “Let all those rally round the Throne who, true to Russia’s\r\n   past, honestly and conscientiously have a care for all the\r\n   affairs of the State such as we have ourselves.”\r\n\r\nIn the rescript that followed on the same day a form of Legislative\r\nAssembly was promised in these words--\r\n\r\n   “I am resolved henceforth, with the help of God, to convene\r\n   the worthiest men, possessing the confidence of the people\r\n   and elected by them, to participate in the elaboration and\r\n   consideration of legislative measures.”\r\n\r\nBuliguine, who had now succeeded Mirski as Minister of the Interior,\r\nand was probably the author of the rescript, was appointed to organize\r\nthe elections. But a counterblast of reaction swept over the distracted\r\nTsar; Trepoff was made Assistant-Minister of the Interior and Chief of\r\nthe Police, with full power to forbid all congresses, associations,\r\nor meetings, and Buliguine resigned, though he remained nominally in\r\noffice till the end of October.\r\n\r\nOutbreaks in the country became continually more serious. In June there\r\nwas fierce rioting in Lodz, the great manufacturing town of Poland, and\r\nin the Baltic port of Libau. In the same month the great battleship\r\n_Potemkin_ of the Black Sea fleet mutinied at Odessa, threw two\r\nbig shells into the town, burnt the docks, and steamed away to the\r\nmouth of the Danube for refuge.\r\n\r\nMid-August brought another manifesto, which began with the usual\r\nprecepts of maudlin falsehood--\r\n\r\n   “The Empire of Russia is formed and strengthened by the\r\n   indestructible solidarity of the Tsar with the people and the\r\n   people with the Tsar. The concord and union of the Tsar and the\r\n   people are a great moral force, which has created Russia in the\r\n   course of centuries by protecting her from all misfortunes and\r\n   all attacks, and has constituted up to the present time a pledge\r\n   of unity, independence, integrity, material well-being, and\r\n   intellectual development.\r\n\r\n   “Autocratic Tsars, our ancestors, constantly had that object in\r\n   view, and the time has come to follow out their good intentions\r\n   and to summon elected representatives from the whole of Russia\r\n   to take a constant and active part in the elaboration of laws,\r\n   attaching for this purpose to the higher State institutions\r\n   a special consultative body, entrusted with the preliminary\r\n   elaboration and discussion of measures, and with the examination\r\n   of the State Budget.\r\n\r\n   “It is for this reason that, while preserving the fundamental\r\n   law regarding autocratic power, we have deemed it well to form a\r\n   State Duma, and to approve regulations for the elections to this\r\n   Duma.”\r\n\r\nThis consultative Duma was to lay its proposals before the Council of\r\nState, which might submit them to the Tsar if it approved. The Duma\r\nwas to meet not later than January, 1906, and was to consist of 412\r\nmembers, representing 50 governments and the military province of the\r\nDon, only 28 of the members representing towns. The members were to\r\nbe paid £1 a day and fares, and were to sit for five years, unless the\r\nTsar chose to dissolve them. Their meetings were to be secret, except\r\nthat the President might admit the Press if he chose.\r\n\r\nOn September 7th a race-feud broke out between the Mohammedan Tartars\r\nand the Armenians at Baku, on the Caspian, and spread to Tiflis and\r\nall along the southern slopes of the Caucasus. The destruction of the\r\ngreat oil-works at Baku involved a loss of many millions of pounds, and\r\nfurther embarrassed the railways and manufacturing districts, which\r\ndepended almost entirely on naphtha for their fuel.\r\n\r\nOn September 25th an assembly of 300 representatives of the Zemstvos of\r\nthe empire was gathered in a private house at Moscow to consider their\r\nattitude towards the promised Duma, which was regarded as a concession\r\nto their previous representations during the year. They recognized that\r\nthe Duma of the August manifesto would not be either a representative\r\nor legislative assembly, but, regarding it as a possible rallying-point\r\nfor the general movement towards freedom, they agreed to obtain as many\r\nseats as possible, so as to form a united group of advanced opinion.\r\n\r\nThey further drew up a programme of their political aims, including\r\nthe formation of a National Legislative Assembly; a regular budget\r\nsystem; the abolition of passports; equal rights for all citizens,\r\nincluding peasants; equal responsibility of all officials and private\r\ncitizens before the law; the liberation of the villager from the petty\r\nofficial (natchalnik); inviolability of person and home; and freedom of\r\nconscience, speech, press, meeting, and association.\r\n\r\nThe programme is important, as indicating what to the average Liberal\r\npolitician in England would appear the most obvious abuses of the\r\nRussian system, because nothing is here demanded which has not long\r\nago been obtained for our own country by the efforts of our upper and\r\nmiddle classes in the past.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the assembly broke up, Prince Sergius Troubetzkoy, the true\r\nleader of these Liberal or Zemski delegates, the President of the\r\nMoscow Zemstvo, and for a month past the Rector of the University, went\r\nto St. Petersburg to urge the Government to allow public meetings,\r\nand while speaking on behalf of free speech at the Ministry of Public\r\nEducation, he suddenly died. He was only forty-three, and it is\r\ntempting to speak of him as the first of the Girondists to fall. But\r\nall through what I have seen in Russia, I have avoided even a mental\r\nreference to the French Revolution as carefully as I could. For history\r\nis a great hindrance in judging the present or the future.\r\n\r\nThe manifesto of October 19th, announcing the final conclusion of the\r\npeace with Japan, by which the Russian Government was compelled to\r\nabandon all for which it had striven during many years in the Far East,\r\nwas hardly noticed in the gathering excitement of the days.\r\n\r\nOn October 21st, the workmen again appeared unexpectedly upon the\r\nscene, and delivered their first telling blow by declaring a general\r\nrailway strike. The strength of the movement was that it disorganized\r\ntrade, made the capitalist and commercial classes very uncomfortable,\r\nand, above all, that it prevented the Government from sending troops\r\nrapidly to any particular point of disturbance. The weakness was that,\r\nas in all strikes, the strikers were threatened with starvation while\r\ntheir employers suffered only discomfort; that the peasants, being\r\nunable to get their produce to market, began to regard the revolution\r\nwith suspicion; and that the Government succeeded in running a military\r\ntrain between St. Petersburg and Moscow (only a ten hours’ journey)\r\nnearly all the time.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the strikers were in the main political, as could be\r\nseen from the demands presented to Witte by a deputation on October\r\n24th--\r\n\r\n   “The claims of the working classes must be settled by laws\r\n   constituted by the will of the people and sanctioned by all\r\n   Russia. The only solution is to announce political guarantees\r\n   for freedom and the convocation of a Constituent Assembly,\r\n   elected by direct, universal, and secret suffrage. Otherwise the\r\n   country will be forced into rebellion.”\r\n\r\nTo this petition Witte’s reply was peculiarly characteristic--\r\n\r\n   “A Constituent Assembly is for the present impossible. Universal\r\n   suffrage would, in fact, only give pre-eminence to the richest\r\n   classes, because they could influence all the voting by their\r\n   money. Liberty of the press and of public meeting will be\r\n   granted very shortly. I am myself strongly opposed to all\r\n   persecution and bloodshed, and I am willing to support the\r\n   greatest amount of liberty possible.... But there is not in\r\n   the entire world a single cultivated man who is in favour of\r\n   universal suffrage.”\r\n\r\nUndeterred by any fear of exclusion from the circle of culture,\r\nthe workmen continued their demands for universal suffrage and\r\na Constituent Assembly, and on October 26th the Central Strike\r\nCommittee--or Council of Labour Delegates, as it was properly\r\ncalled--sitting in St. Petersburg, declared a general strike throughout\r\nRussia. About a million workers came out.\r\n\r\nThis was the second workmen’s blow, and it shook Tsardom from top to\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nFour days after the beginning of the strike, the famous Manifesto of\r\nOctober 30th (17th in Old Style) was issued, promising personal freedom\r\nand a constitution. The document began with the harmless necessary\r\ncant--\r\n\r\n   “The troubles and agitations in our capitals and numerous other\r\n   places fill our heart with great and painful sorrow.... The\r\n   sorrow of the people is the sorrow of the sovereign.... We\r\n   therefore direct our Government to carry out our inflexible will\r\n   in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n   “I. To grant to our people the immutable foundations of civil\r\n   liberty, based on real inviolability of person, and freedom of\r\n   conscience, speech, union, and association.\r\n\r\n   “II. Without deferring the elections to the State Duma already\r\n   ordered, to call to participation in the Duma (as far as is\r\n   possible in view of the shortness of time before the Duma\r\n   assembles) those classes of the population now completely\r\n   deprived of electoral rights, leaving the ultimate development\r\n   of the principle of electoral right in general to the newly\r\n   established legislature.\r\n\r\n   “III. To establish it as an immutable rule that no law can ever\r\n   come into force without the approval of the State Duma, and that\r\n   it shall be possible for the elected of the people to exercise\r\n   a real participation in supervising the legality of the acts of\r\n   authorities appointed by us.”\r\n\r\nThis manifesto was greeted by an outburst of joy unequalled in the\r\nmelancholy annals of Russia. Righteousness and peace kissed each other\r\nupon the streets; and so did professors, students, and even working\r\npeople. Red flags paraded the squares, generals saluted them, soldiers\r\njoined in the Marseillaise of labour. But the Central Strike Committee\r\nwas not overcome by the general hallucination. They rightly refused to\r\ntrust the Tsar without guarantees, and they continued to press their\r\ndemands for a political amnesty and the convocation of a Constituent\r\nAssembly. They also demanded the restoration of its old liberties to\r\nFinland, and the dismissal of Trepoff. When anti-Jewish riots broke out\r\nat Kieff, Warsaw, and especially at Odessa, they steadily and justly\r\nmaintained that the “Black Hundred” or “Hooligans” of the massacre and\r\npillage were encouraged by the police and the priests, who wished to\r\nmake out that the Russian people were opposed to political liberties.\r\n\r\nThe panic of the Government continued. They could not measure the\r\nstrength of this new force among the work-people, or of this new\r\ninstrument, the general strike. They were uncertain, also, about the\r\narmy, which, together with the police and officials, formed their sole\r\nprotection from ruin. Pobiedonostzeff, the aged Procurator of the Holy\r\nSynod, and the embodiment of an obstinate and narrow tyranny in Church\r\nand State, resigned. On November 4th, an amnesty was proclaimed for\r\npolitical offenders, though certain qualifications and categories were\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nOn the same day a manifesto restored the old liberties of Finland,\r\nabolishing the decree of February 15, 1899, by which the autocratic\r\nprinciple, the dictatorship, and the employment of Russian gendarmes\r\nhad been imposed upon the duchy contrary to its original constitution,\r\nand repealing also the military law of July 12, 1901, which compelled\r\nrecruits to serve outside their own country.\r\n\r\nOn November 9th Trepoff sent in his resignation, and Durnovo, since\r\ninfamous for his brutality, took office. The same day a violent but\r\nill-considered mutiny broke out among the sailors and gunners at\r\nKronstadt.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the Government began to recover courage, and we may\r\nmark the gradual revival of reaction. Perhaps it was immediately due\r\nto the refusal of the Liberal Zemstvoists to take part in a ministry\r\nunder Witte, unless the promises of the manifesto were guaranteed,\r\nand a Constituent Assembly convened. In any case the change was quite\r\napparent in a manifesto of November 12th, declaring the present\r\nsituation unsuitable for the introduction of reforms, which would only\r\nbe possible when the country was pacified.\r\n\r\nNext day a ukase proclaimed martial law in Poland, and excluded that\r\ncountry from the manifesto, on the pretence that the Poles were\r\nplotting against the integrity of the Russian Empire by establishing a\r\nseparate nation of their own.\r\n\r\nThe Central Strike Committee answered this ukase on the morrow\r\n(November 14th) by declaring another general strike in sympathy with\r\nPoland, and Witte, on his side, retaliated by posting an appeal to the\r\nwork-people, conceived in his most unctuous and fatherly style. It ran--\r\n\r\n   “Brothers! Workmen! Go back to your work and cease from\r\n   disorder. Have pity on your wives and children, and turn a deaf\r\n   ear to mischievous counsels. The Tsar commands us to devote\r\n   special attention to the labour question, and to that end has\r\n   appointed a Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which will\r\n   establish just relations between masters and men. Only give us\r\n   time, and I will do all that is possible for you. Pay attention\r\n   to the advice of a man who loves you and wishes you well.”\r\n\r\nThis appeal was immediately followed (November 17th) by a manifesto to\r\nthe peasants, reducing their payments for the use of land by one-half\r\nafter January, 1906, and abolishing it altogether after January,\r\n1907. These payments were still being made under the land settlement\r\nthat followed the emancipation of the serfs in the early sixties, and\r\ntheir nominal value to the Government was seven million pounds a year.\r\nBut the apparent generosity of the remission is diminished by the\r\nconsideration that the peasants had already paid the economic value of\r\nthe land many times over, and pressure could still be brought upon them\r\nto make up the heavy arrears due to successive famines.\r\n\r\nThree days later (November 20th), the Central Strike Committee declared\r\nthe strike at an end. This second general strike was felt to have\r\nbeen a failure. People and funds were still exhausted by the first.\r\nComparatively few of the great factories came out; the object of the\r\nstrike was too remote from the workman’s daily life to persuade him to\r\nendure the starvation of his family for it. So the strike failed. It\r\nproduced nothing; it did not frighten or paralyse the Government.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Strike Committee remained the most powerful body\r\nof men in the Empire, and their order commanding the cessation of\r\nthe strike called hopefully upon the working classes to continue the\r\nrevolutionary propaganda in the army, and to organize themselves into\r\nmilitary forces “for the final encounter between all Russia and the\r\nbloody monarchy now dragging out its last few days.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when, on November 21st I landed at the\r\nrevolutionary little port of Reval, and went on to St. Petersburg by\r\nthe first train which had run since the strike ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                         THE STRIKE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n\r\nAway in the western quarter of St. Petersburg, at some distance from\r\nthe fashionable centre, stands a rather decrepit hall of debased\r\nclassic. In England one would have put it down to George II.’s time,\r\nbut in St. Petersburg everything looks fifty years older than it is,\r\nbecause fashions used to travel slowly there from France. Among the\r\nfaded gilding of stucco pilasters and allegorical emblems of the\r\nvirtues and the arts, are hung the obscure portraits of long-forgotten\r\nmen--philosophers, governors, and generals--who were of importance\r\nenough in their day to be painted for the remembrance of posterity.\r\nGlaringly fresh among the others hangs the portrait of the hesitating\r\ngentleman whom the accident of birth has left Autocrat of Russia,\r\nwhether he likes it or not. The hall was dedicated to the discussion\r\nof “Free Economics” by some scientific body, but never before had\r\neconomics been discussed there with such freedom as during those\r\nNovember nights when the Central Strike Committee, or Council of Labour\r\nDelegates, chose it for their meetings.\r\n\r\nAdmission was by ticket only, and I obtained mine from a revolutionary\r\ncompositor, hairy as John the Baptist, and as expectant of a glory to\r\nbe revealed. On the first night that I went, the big chamber, with its\r\nante-room half separated by plaster columns, was crowded with working\r\npeople. So was the entrance hall, where goloshes are left, in Russian\r\nfashion, so that the floors may not be dirtied. Some of the men wore\r\nthe ordinary dingy clothes of English or European factory-hands, making\r\nall as like as earwigs. Some had come dressed in the national pink\r\nshirt, with embroidered flowers or patterns down the front and round\r\nthe collar. But most wore the common Russian blouse of dark brown\r\ncanvas, buttoned up close to the neck, and gathered round the waist by\r\na leather belt.\r\n\r\nMany women were there, too, but as a rule they were not working women\r\nfrom the mills. Some may have been artisans or the wives of artisans,\r\nbut most were evidently journalists, doctors, or students, from the\r\nintellectual middle classes, which in Russia produces the woman\r\nrevolutionist--the woman who has played so fine a part in the long\r\nstruggle of the past, and was now elated above human happiness by\r\nthe hope of victory. For Russian women enjoy a working equality and\r\ncomradeship with men, whether in martyrdom or in triumph, such as no\r\nother nation has yet realized.\r\n\r\nThe workmen were delegates from the various trades of the capital\r\nand some of the provinces--railway men, textile hands, iron workers,\r\ntimber workers, and others. About five hundred of them had been chosen,\r\nand each delegate represented about five hundred other workers. But\r\nround the long green table in the middle of that decrepit hall, under\r\nthe eyes of the hesitating little Tsar’s portrait, sat the chosen few\r\nwhom the delegates had appointed as their executive committee. Between\r\ntwenty and thirty of them were there--men of a rather intellectual type\r\namong workers, a little raised above the average, either by education\r\nor natural power. A few wore some kind of collar, a few showed the\r\nfinest type of Russian head--the strong, square forehead and chin, the\r\nthoughtful and melancholy eyes, the straight nose, not very broad, and\r\nthe dense masses of long hair all standing on end. A few seemed to be\r\nbred just a trifle too fine for their work, as dog-fanciers say. There\r\nthey sat and spoke and listened--the members of that Strike Committee\r\nwhich had won fame in a month--just a handful of unarmed and unlearned\r\nmen, who had shaken the strongest and most pitiless despotism in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, along one side of the table, was their president, the\r\ncompositor Khroustoloff--or Nosar, as his real name was--a man of about\r\nthirty-five, pale, grey-eyed, with long fair hair, not a strong-looking\r\nman, but worn with excitement and sleeplessness. For there was no time\r\nnow for human needs, and his edge of collar was crumpled and twisted\r\nlike an old rag. Yet he controlled an excited and inexperienced meeting\r\nwith temper and ease, showing sometimes a sudden flicker of laughter\r\nfor which there is very little room in Russian life. Neither for\r\nsleep, nor human needs, nor laughter, was there time, but in front of\r\nKhroustoloff and of all those men lay the prison or the grave, and in\r\nthem there is always time enough.\r\n\r\nThat night, as long as I was there, the meeting was occupied with the\r\ndiscussion of the eight-hours’ day. One of the executive read out\r\nthe reports received from all the factories represented by delegates\r\nas to the hours of labour at present. In some cases, the masters had\r\nconceded an eight-hours’ day after the first strike. In others, they\r\nhad come down to nine, in others to ten. Most had absolutely refused a\r\nreduction. These reports, though monotonous and many, were listened to\r\nwith the silence that characterizes a Russian meeting. It was broken\r\nonly now and then by a little laughter or a murmur of anger. I have\r\nnever heard a Russian speaker interrupted even by applause.\r\n\r\nThe evening before I had attended a meeting where a dull but deserving\r\nspeaker, to whom no one wanted to listen, went on for an hour and\r\ntwenty minutes in a silence like an African forest’s, with only\r\nan occasional whisper of breezy dresses as the audience changed\r\ntheir position at the end of some uninteresting clause. Ages of\r\ndumb suffering have given these people the interminable patience of\r\nmountains, and a public meeting is so new to them that they find a\r\nfearful pleasure in speeches which our free-born electors would howl\r\ndown in three minutes. Any meeting of British trade-unionists would\r\nhave polished off the Strike Committee’s business in an hour, but when\r\nI came away, though it was past two in the morning and the meeting had\r\nbegun at six in the afternoon, the discussion was still proceeding\r\nwith healthy vigour, and there were plenty of other subjects of equal\r\nimportance still to be settled. The Committee, in fact, sat almost in\r\npermanence night and day.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the reports were all read, the executive gathered up\r\ntheir papers and adjourned into an upper room to consider their\r\ndecision. During their absence, the other delegates broke up into\r\ngroups according to trades, for the discussion of their own affairs.\r\nStanding on a chair, a man would shout, “Weavers, this way, please!”\r\n“Engineers, here!” or “Railway-men, this way!” and the various workers\r\nclustered round in swarms. A fine hum of business arose, and a buzz\r\nof conversation with outbursts of laughter too, for all spirits still\r\nwere high with success and the confidence of victory. At last, as\r\nthe executive remained over an hour in conference, a yellow-haired\r\nyoung workman with a voice like the Last Trumpet, raised the Russian\r\n“Marseillaise,” and in a moment the room was sounding to the hymn of\r\nfreedom. Russian words--rather vague and rhetorical words--have been\r\nset to the old French tune, and even the tune has been altered at the\r\nend of the chorus, to make room for the words, “Forward, forward,\r\nforward!” which come in suddenly, like the beating of a drum. It was\r\nsung in all the streets of all the cities, but I heard it first in the\r\nmidst of German territory, upon the Kiel canal. For as I was coming\r\nover, the only passenger upon the Russian boat, we met an emigrant ship\r\nbound for the refuge of freedom, as England still was at that time, and\r\nat the sight of our Russian flag the emigrants all burst into the song,\r\nthe men waving their hats and the women their babes in defiance.\r\n\r\nAfter the “Marseillaise,” the workmen turned to national songs, one\r\nof which was almost as magnificent, and was touched with the immense\r\nsorrow of Russia. All had one burden--the hatred of tyrants, the love\r\nof freedom, the willingness to die for her sake. To us, such phrases\r\nhave come to bear an unreal and antiquated sound, for it is many\r\ncenturies since England enjoyed a real tyranny, and the long comfort\r\nof freedom has made us slack and indifferent to evil. But in Russia\r\nboth tyranny and revolt are genuine and alive, and at any moment a man\r\nor woman may be called upon to prove how far the love of freedom will\r\nreally take them on the road to death.\r\n\r\nA few days before this workmen’s meeting, I had been at an assembly\r\nof the educated classes to protest against capital punishment. One\r\nspeaker--a professor of famous learning--was worn and twisted by long\r\nyears of Siberian exile. He was the worst speaker present, but it\r\nwas he who received the deep thunder of applause. Another had, with\r\nRussian melancholy, devoted his life to compiling an immense history of\r\nassassination by the State. Before he began to speak, he announced that\r\nhe was going to read the list of those who had been executed for their\r\nlove of freedom since the time of Nicholas I. Instantly the whole great\r\naudience rose in silence and remained standing in silence while a man\r\nmight count a hundred. It was as when a regiment drinks in silence to\r\nfallen comrades. But few regiments have fought for a cause so noble,\r\nand few for a cause in which the survivors still ran so great a risk.\r\n\r\nThe executive returned from their consultation, and at once the\r\nmeeting was quiet. President Khroustoloff, in a clear and reasonable\r\nstatement, announced that, in the opinion of the executive, a fresh\r\ngeneral strike on the eight-hours’ question would at present be a\r\nmistake. The eight-hours’ day was an ideal to be kept before them;\r\nthey must allow no master who had once granted it to go back on his\r\nword; they must urge the others forward, little by little, and in the\r\nmeanwhile organize and combine till they could confront both capitalism\r\nand autocracy with assurance. Another member of the executive spoke\r\nin support of this decision, and then the delegates of the opposite\r\nparty had their turn. It was the old difference between the responsible\r\nopportunist, who takes what he can get, and the man of the ideal, who\r\nwill take nothing if he cannot have all. The idealists pointed to\r\nthe evident intention of Witte’s Government to thwart the workmen’s\r\nadvance. They pointed, with good reason, to the gradual renewal of\r\npolice persecution during the last few days, and to the encouragement\r\ngiven to masters who declared a lock-out. They urged that it was best\r\nto fight before the common enemy regained his full power, and that\r\nthe general strike, so efficient before, was still the only weapon\r\nthe workmen had. It was all true. Yet the recent strike had almost\r\nfailed, and it was just because a general strike was the workmen’s only\r\nweapon that it should be sparingly used. A second failure within a\r\nfortnight would show the Government that freedom’s only weapon was not\r\nso dangerous after all. In the end the executive had its way; they were\r\nsupported by three hundred votes against twenty; and there could be no\r\nquestion of the wisdom. The weapon of a general strike is too powerful\r\nto be brought out, except for some special and all-important crisis. It\r\nis like an ancient king, more feared when little seen.\r\n\r\nFreedom at that moment was just hanging in the balance. One almost\r\nheard the grating of the scales as very slowly the balance began to\r\nswing back again. Already things were not quite so hopeful as they had\r\nbeen, and many good revolutionists spoke of the future with foreboding.\r\nThe first fine rapture of liberty was over, and people who had eagerly\r\nproclaimed themselves Liberals three weeks before, now began to feel in\r\ntheir pockets, to hesitate and look round. In subdued whispers commerce\r\nsighed for Trepoff back again, and the ancient security of a merchant’s\r\ngoods. They pretended terror of peasant outbreaks, and the violence of\r\n“Black Hundred” mobs, organized by the police just to show the dangers\r\nof reform. But it was reform itself that they dreaded, and the name of\r\nSocialism was more terrible to them than the tyranny.\r\n\r\nDay by day the police were becoming active again. As family men with\r\na stake in the country, they could not be expected to see their\r\noccupation taken from them without a struggle. They had the same\r\ninterest in the ancient _régime_ as the Russian aristocracy in\r\nParis or Cannes; and for their livelihood the misery of the people was\r\nequally essential. Whenever they dared, they planted themselves in\r\nfront of the doors and drove the audience away from a meeting; and\r\nthe audience had to go, for except to bombs and revolvers there was\r\nno appeal. Every day I watched the police hounding groups of tattered\r\nand starving peasants or workmen along the streets, because they had\r\nventured to come to St. Petersburg without passports, and had to be\r\nimprisoned till a luggage train could take them back to their starving\r\nhomes. In spite of the manifesto, the censor of the post-office was\r\nactive again. It is a terrible thing for a civil servant to feel that\r\nhis work does not justify his pay. So the censor blacked out a cartoon\r\nin _Punch_ representing the Tsar as hesitating between good and\r\nevil, and then he felt he could look the world in the face.\r\n\r\nAlready the people recognized that as yet they had no guarantee of\r\nfreedom. As long as the Oligarchs controlled the police and the army,\r\nfreedom existed only on sufferance. No one knew what the army would do,\r\nand no one knew what the fighting power of the revolution was. Those\r\nunknown factors alone terrified the Oligarchs into reform. But all the\r\npromises were only bits of paper. It had long been proved that the\r\nTsar’s word went for nothing. At the birth of his son he had abolished\r\nflogging, but the taxes had been “flogged out” of the peasants just as\r\nbefore. Manifesto after manifesto had been issued without the least\r\nresult, beyond winning the applause of an English writer or two. So\r\nfar the Tsar’s pledges of reform had been no more effectual than his\r\nConference of Peace and he could only become harmless if he had no\r\npower to harm.\r\n\r\nYet the outward appearance of freedom surpassed all hope and\r\nimagination. Nothing like this had ever been seen in Russia before.\r\nNewspapers dared to tell the truth. Meetings were held which a few\r\nweeks before would have sent every speaker to the cells. The Poles\r\ngathered in a great assembly demanding the overthrow of absolutism and\r\nsolidarity for the revolution among all the states of the Empire. Women\r\nand children taunted the patrols of Guards and Cossacks as they rode\r\nthe streets. Ladies threw open their nice clean rooms for workmen to\r\nmeet in. The students’ restaurants hummed with liberty. The air sounded\r\nwith the “Marseillaise.”\r\n\r\n“In Russia now, everybody thinks,” said a revolutionist to me, “and\r\nwhere people think, liberty must come.” Thought and liberty were to\r\nbring him death in a few weeks, but for the moment it seemed impossible\r\nthat any reaction could bring the old order back. All the king’s\r\nhorses and all the king’s men could not restore that ancient tyranny.\r\nThe spring of freedom had come slowly up that way, but at last it was\r\ngreeted as certain, and so it seemed to me when in the darkness of\r\nearly morning I left that workmen’s meeting still hot with discussion\r\nin the mouldering hall, and tramped home through slush and thawing\r\nsnow, watching the rough floes of drifting ice as they settled down\r\ninto their winter places upon the Neva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                          THE WORKMEN’S HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Schlüsselburg road runs nearly all the way beside the great stream\r\nof the Neva, which was still pouring down in flood in those November\r\ndays, though it sounded incessantly with the whisper of floating ice.\r\nThe road leads from St. Petersburg along the whole course of the\r\nriver up to that ill-omened fortress in the Ladoga lake, where so\r\nmany of the martyrs of freedom have enjoyed the imprisonment or death\r\nwith which Russia rewards greatness. For six or seven miles the road\r\npasses through a series of villages, now united into one long and\r\nsqualid street, inseparable from the city, though only a few hundred\r\nyards behind the mills and workmen’s dwellings lie flat fields, and\r\nwoods, and dull but open country. This is the largest manufacturing\r\ndistrict of the capital. Its factories had already become historic with\r\nbloodshed, and it was here that the workmen’s party was organized, and\r\nthe Council of Labour Delegates first formed.\r\n\r\nThe mills stand on both sides of the river, but as a rule the\r\nwork-people live on the south or left bank, where the road runs; for\r\nthere is no passable road on the other side. In summer they pay a\r\nfarthing toll to steam ferry-boats. In winter they walk across the ice\r\nto work, guided by little rows of Christmas trees stuck on the ice, as\r\nis the Russian way. But between whiles, twice a year, there come a few\r\ndays when they cannot go to work at all. Those days ought to have come\r\nby the time I visited the region first, but the frost was late.\r\n\r\nEverything was strange that year. For months together no work had\r\nbeen done, and though some of the mills had just re-opened after the\r\nsecond general strike, the road was crowded with shabby men and women,\r\nwho gathered at the corners, or trampled up and down in the filth, or\r\nsat stewing in the dirty tea-rooms, quieting their hunger with drink.\r\nFully 60,000 of them were out of work, for in answer to the strike many\r\nmasters had declared a lock-out.\r\n\r\nBackwards and forwards among them marched little sections of six or\r\nseven soldiers, their bayonets fixed, their rifles loaded, their warm\r\nbrown overcoats paid for by the work-people and the peasants. Groups\r\nof four or five Cossacks clattered to and fro with carbine and sword,\r\nwhile on the saddle, ready to the right hand, hung the terrible nagaika\r\nor Cossack whip, paid for by the work-people and the peasants. It is\r\nheavy and solid, with twisted hide, like a short and thicker sjambok;\r\nat the butt is a loop for the wrist, and near the end of the lash a\r\njagged lump of lead is firmly tied into the strands. When a Cossack\r\nrises in his stirrups to strike, he can break a skull right open, and\r\nany ordinary blow will slit a face from brow to chin, and cripple a\r\nwoman or child for life.\r\n\r\nThe Manifesto had not changed the Cossack nature. A week before, at a\r\nworkmen’s meeting held to discuss the strike, it was proposed to stop\r\nthe steam trams which run along the road. But the Cossacks had received\r\norders not to allow the trams to be stopped. So down they trotted to\r\nthe meeting; a pistol shot is said to have been heard somewhere in the\r\ndarkness, and in a moment the horses were plunging through the midst\r\nof a confused and helpless crowd, while swords and nagaikas hewed the\r\npeople down. The number of killed and wounded was variously given, as\r\nis usual in massacres.\r\n\r\nOn one of my later visits down the road, I became acquainted with a\r\nman who had survived a scene even more terrible. As a small patrol of\r\nCossacks was riding by, a little boy of eight, who had come to the mill\r\nwith his mother, shook his tiny fist at them from a window. By command\r\nof their officer, the men rode into the mill yard, dismounted, entered\r\nthe machinery rooms, bayoneted the child, and began firing at random\r\nupon the people at their work. Eight were killed where they stood.\r\nThe man who told me of the deed escaped through a side door, and hid\r\nhimself under the boilers till the soldiers rode away elated with\r\nvictory. Then the workmen dragged out the dead, and the boy’s body was\r\ngiven to his mother.\r\n\r\nTired of being slaughtered like fowls, the workmen themselves were\r\ncollecting arms, and had organized a kind of volunteer service, or\r\n“militia,” as they called it. Armed groups crept through the fields and\r\nback lanes from one point of vantage to another. Even in the daytime,\r\nfiring was common in the streets, and almost every night the workmen\r\nmet the soldiers in sharp encounter. The factories, whether at work or\r\nnot, were all guarded by sentries inside and out. The Alexandrovsky\r\nironworks, which belong to Government, and had been shut down the day\r\nbefore I was there, were at once filled with troops, and the hands,\r\nsome five thousand in number, remained outside to increase the shabby\r\nand indignant crowd upon the street.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n   _Art Reproduction Co._\r\n\r\n  AN AUTUMN IDYLL.\r\n\r\n   From _Sulphur_ (_Jupel_).]\r\n\r\nThe ironworkers were the best paid of all the workmen in the district.\r\nThe works are in an old red-brick factory, built originally for making\r\nguns, but long used for the locomotives on the straight line from St.\r\nPetersburg to Moscow. Many charming personages in Russian society had\r\njustly regarded that factory as the source of human happiness. But in\r\ntheir trepidation to enjoy, they had neglected the fount of enjoyment,\r\nand the place had long been sliding down to ruin. Already it was much\r\ncheaper to buy new locomotives from Germany, Belgium, or Zurich, in\r\nspite of the high tariff, than even to repair the old engines here. At\r\nlast, I suppose, just the one inevitable day had come when the thing\r\nbecame too ludicrous even for a Government’s methods of industry. The\r\ngates were shut, and the five thousand hands turned out to meditate on\r\nthe source of human happiness.\r\n\r\nIt was thought at the time that, like the master of finesse who pays\r\nhis tailor by ordering more clothes, the management would open again\r\nsoon, because one per cent. of the wages had always been stopped for a\r\npension fund. This fund was estimated at something like £2,000,000, and\r\nthe Government might well prefer to go on paying out several thousands\r\na year in dead loss rather than be called upon for a solid £2,000,000\r\nwhen nothing more could be flogged out of the starving peasants, and\r\nFrance was beginning to look twice at a sou before lending it. What\r\nhappened in the end I did not hear, but I passed down that road some\r\nmonths later, and the works were still shut up.\r\n\r\nOther mills, which did not rest upon State credit (that is to say,\r\non drink and the flogging of peasants), and were struggling not to\r\nkeep shut, but to keep open, were naturally in a different position.\r\nThere are cotton mills, wool mills, paper mills, and candle mills\r\nalong the river, many of them run by English capital, and managed by\r\nEnglish overseers. In most of the textile mills, the machinery is\r\nalso English, this being almost the only import in which England still\r\nrivals Germany. There is a greater spaciousness about the buildings\r\nand yards than in England, due, I suppose, to the cheapness of land;\r\nthough, in fact, our old economic theories of rent are valueless here,\r\nfor, in spite of the vast extent of uncultivated land in Russia, the\r\nrents in the capital towns are far higher than in London. But, apart\r\nfrom this spaciousness and a certain easy-going slackness in the\r\nlabour, one might imagine one’s self in a Lancashire or Yorkshire mill.\r\nIt was in mills like these that the labour questions arose which were\r\nreally the causes of the strike that shook the Russian despotism. Of\r\ncourse, political questions came in--the war scandals, the demands for\r\nhome rule, amnesty, universal suffrage, and a constituent assembly. But\r\na revolution, like a war, goes upon its belly, and it is difficult to\r\nget working men to move if they are fairly content with their food and\r\nlodging. It is still more difficult to get working women to move.\r\n\r\nTill ten years ago the hours in these mills were seventy-five a week,\r\nor twelve and a half a day, not counting the dinner hours. They then\r\nfell to sixty-seven, and the strike of last October brought them down\r\nto sixty-two and a half. For the first week of November (just after the\r\nmanifesto), the hands proclaimed an eight-hours’ day, and walked out\r\nof the mills when the time was up. After a week of that, the managers\r\nshut the gates, preferring to pay the hands the fortnight’s wages to\r\nwhich they are entitled on dismissal, and then to let the mills stand\r\nidle. About a fortnight later, the textile managers agreed to come down\r\nto sixty and a half hours a week, and on that arrangement the hands\r\ncame in again. Thus in ten years the workmen had reduced their hours by\r\nnearly fifteen a week, and seven of these had been knocked off in two\r\nmonths, simply by combination in strikes. As I said, the general strike\r\nis a powerful weapon, though, unhappily, dangerous to those who use it.\r\n\r\nAt the time there was a general opinion that a nine-hours’ day would\r\nbe enforced by an Imperial ukase. Even the employers believed it,\r\nand looked forward to making up the loss by increased duties on\r\nimports, and higher prices for their goods. The workmen would probably\r\nacquiesce, for a strike falls most heavily on themselves, and under the\r\nRussian factory laws any one who incites to a strike or joins in it may\r\nbe imprisoned for four to eight months. Till December, 1904, all trade\r\nunions and meetings of workmen were also illegal. During his period of\r\nill-omened power, Plehve had affected to encourage meetings in this\r\nvery district, but his sole object was to ascertain who were the real\r\nleaders among the people, and who were the best speakers. When that was\r\nknown, in the middle of the night, knocking would be heard at a man’s\r\ndoor. He would open it to a group of soldiers or police, and from that\r\nmoment he disappeared, spirited away, no one knew where. It was the\r\nGovernment’s method of protecting vested interests.\r\n\r\nWages nearly always go by piecework, and they vary according to skill.\r\nIn the cotton mills a man may earn anything between 15_d._ and 4_s._\r\n4_d._ a day, and a woman between 10_d._ and 2_s._ 4½_d._ In the woollen\r\nmills a weaver makes about 3_s._ 5_d_. a day, and he has two assistants\r\n(generally girls) who make from 1_s._ 10_d._ to 2_s._ 4_d._ each. The\r\nironworkers, as I said, get a rather higher wage, but the maximum, I\r\nthink, in no case is over 30_s._ a week, and I doubt if the average,\r\nincluding women and girls, is over 15_s._\r\n\r\nThe mere amount of money in wages is unimportant. A handful of bay-salt\r\nor three yards of cheap cotton may be good wages to an African native.\r\nAll depends on what the payment can buy and what work it represents,\r\nand I am inclined to think from what 1 have seen in many lands that in\r\nreality the wage of the working class is much the same all the world\r\nover. The standard of tolerable existence certainly varies a little,\r\nbut the wage is always regulated by the lowest standard that will be\r\nendured. Wherever I have consulted an overseer or mill-owner as to\r\nthe standard of living in Russia, he has almost always told me that I\r\nmust not judge by English ideas, “because the people here are quite\r\nsatisfied with black bread and cucumbers.” By cucumbers he meant the\r\nsmall pickled gherkins in barrels, such as form one peculiar ingredient\r\nin the smell of Petticoat Lane. At the same time all English overseers\r\nwere agreed that the Russian workman’s standard of work is far lower\r\nthan the English. A Russian will mind only two looms, they told me,\r\nwhere an Englishman will mind four or even six. It had not occurred to\r\nthem that there might be some connection between the standard of food\r\nand the standard of work, nor, indeed, did that concern them much, for\r\nin the end they obtained about the same amount of work for the same\r\namount of wage.\r\n\r\nWhen I became more acquainted with the work-people’s life and had\r\nbeen into several of their homes, I found that, as long as they were\r\nin work, most of them had soup every day, because bad meat was cheap.\r\nBeyond the soup, black bread was the duty, pickled cucumber the\r\npleasure; and the drink was almost unlimited tea--very weak and without\r\nmilk, but syruppy with sugar--varied by an occasional debauch on the\r\nState’s vodka, which pays the greater part of the tyranny’s expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the Schlüsselburg road the work-people live in wooden huts built up\r\nwandering courts or lanes off the main street. I have not seen a family\r\noccupying more than one room. If they rent two or three, they sub-let.\r\nA room costs from 15_s._ to 22_s._ a month, and the larger\r\nrooms are usually divided between two or more families. In some cases\r\neach of the four corners is occupied by a different family, separated\r\nby shawls or strings, and dwelling as though in tents, as used to be\r\nthe fashion in the East End. Till quite lately a very large proportion\r\nof the work-people lived in special barracks built for them inside\r\nthe mills, but during that year of strikes most of the overseers had\r\ncleared their work-people out because they were dangerously near to\r\nthemselves and the machinery, and I did not see the “living-in” system\r\nreally at work till I got to Moscow, where it was still general, though\r\nprobably soon to disappear.\r\n\r\nIn the work-people’s rooms there was hardly ever any furniture beyond\r\nthe bed, the table, some stools, and a chest for clothes. I never\r\nsaw washing things of any kind. Even in winter the family clothes\r\nare washed in the river, the women cutting square holes in the ice\r\nand dipping the clothes into the water below. As to the people, in\r\naccordance with the one salutary rubric of the Orthodox Church, all men\r\n(I am not quite sure about women) must wash before they go to service.\r\nIn preparation for this sacred duty, they pay a few pence at the public\r\nbaths, sluice themselves down with hot water, and then lie steaming on\r\nshelves, brushing their skin with branches of birch. The effect is very\r\nsatisfactory, and the Russians as a whole are a cleanly people, both\r\nin themselves and their houses, compared to ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe work-people have the further advantage of twenty-three\r\necclesiastical holidays in the year, not counting Sundays, and the\r\nmasters are obliged to provide a hospital or to pay for medical\r\nassistance, even for women with child. In an English mill across the\r\nriver, a clubroom for lectures, concerts, and amusements had just been\r\nerected, but the revolution had arrested culture of that kind. It had\r\nalso arrested football, which was just becoming popular. Cricket had\r\nbeen tried, but was found too mysterious and pedantic, too much like\r\nthe British Constitution with all its growths and precedents. The only\r\nnative amusements that I could find were cards, knucklebones, and\r\nthe fortnightly debauch in vodka when the wages are paid. But at the\r\ntime of my first visit, there was some chance that the vodka would be\r\ndropped, for on the previous Sunday night the Strike Committee had\r\ndecided that the work-people should for the present give up spirits,\r\ntobacco, and other Government monopolies, not for abstinence but to\r\ndeprive the Government of revenue. The truly Nationalist party has\r\nurged the same course in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity which complicates the Russian labour question.\r\nSome of the work-people have now lost all connection with the land,\r\nbut a great majority are still bound by the closest links of duty\r\nand affection to their village, and to the little strips of earth\r\nwhich have been allotted to their family. Probably most of the hands\r\nin any mill have come there in hopes of paying the taxes on the land,\r\nand keeping the family alive in the starving village at home. Between\r\nthe village and the factory they are continually passing to and fro.\r\nSometimes as many as half the hands in a mill will set off to their\r\nvillages during the year, and come back again. I have seen the books of\r\none factory, employing nearly 2000 hands, from which over 1000 had gone\r\nand returned. If a working son on the land is called to the army, a\r\nmill hand walks away to take his place. If labour is short at harvest,\r\nthey go. If the village community is re-dividing the land, they go. The\r\nfather of the house at home can always send for them, and they go. It\r\ncomes of that touching passion for the land which is the great motive\r\nof the Russian people. Mercilessly robbed as they have been, nothing\r\nhas yet induced them to believe that land can belong to Tsar, or\r\nPrince, or idle proprietor. Land, they say, cannot belong to people who\r\ndo not work it; of course it cannot. The land belongs to the peasants.\r\nIf only the good Tsar know what the people suffer because their land is\r\nkept from them, he would give it them back. As Stepniak said long ago,\r\nthat simple faith is one of the tragedies of Russian life.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DIARY OF EVENTS\r\n\r\n   On November 20th, a Peasant’s Congress met at Moscow. There\r\n   were 300 delegates including several women. Their main demands\r\n   were for a Constituent Assembly and Nationalization of the\r\n   land. Sixty followers of Tolstoy were present, and most of\r\n   the delegates spoke for revolution by peaceful means. Yet on\r\n   November 27th they were all arrested.\r\n\r\n   On November 26th, a serious mutiny broke out in the army and\r\n   fleet at Sevastopol, under the leadership of Lieutenant Schmidt,\r\n   who had already been expelled from the navy as a Socialist. For\r\n   a few days the Government suffered panic, but the mutiny was put\r\n   down without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n   On November 28th, the post and telegraph hands struck at Moscow\r\n   for the right of union. The strike extended through the service\r\n   and paralysed business and Government action. The average wage\r\n   of the assistants was £5 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          FATHER GAPON AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of December 4th was damp and misty, but from an early hour\r\ncrowds of working people were standing in the slushy snow outside\r\nthe queer old arrangement of two or three huge sheds which is known\r\nas “Salt Town.” It is across the Fontanka canal from the School of\r\nEngineers, not very far from the two churches that commemorate the\r\nmurder of two Tsars. I suppose it has been used at some time or other\r\nas a depôt for a Government salt monopoly, and so received its name. In\r\nordinary peaceful years, it now serves as a suitable place for military\r\nlectures and engineering experiments such as trained the Russian\r\nofficers for their overwhelming defeats. But in the stir of revolution,\r\npopular meetings of every kind assembled there, because its gaunt white\r\nwalls and iron roofs would hold such large crowds of work-people under\r\ncover, and it supplied accommodation for the coats and goloshes of the\r\nintellectual.\r\n\r\nI had already attended an immense all-night meeting there to denounce\r\nthe Government for encouraging the priests and hooligans in their\r\nslaughter of the Jews. That very morning of December 4th the school\r\nteachers were assembled in one of the halls to discuss whether they\r\ntoo should strike and claim the right of union. But the main interest\r\nof the day was centred in the other large hall, where the followers\r\nof Father Gapon--the men who had appealed in procession to the Tsar\r\nhimself on the 22nd of January before--were now gathering together\r\nfor the first time since that childlike appeal had been answered by\r\nmassacre.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was called for ten o’clock in the morning, either to elude\r\nthe police or to save the expense of light. A Russian meeting is, I\r\nthink, very seldom less than an hour late, because the Russians are\r\nby nature a courteous people, and it is obviously impolite to begin\r\nbefore every one who wishes to come has had a chance of being in time.\r\nBut long before eleven there was not standing room for another soul,\r\nand fifteen hundred men and women were waiting with that inexhaustible\r\nRussian patience. Their pallid faces, many of them grim with hunger,\r\nlooked spectral under the dim twilight of a Russian morning, as I\r\nwatched them turned upwards in silence to the platform.\r\n\r\nTwo whispered rumours were going round. One that the Social Democrats\r\nintended to break up the meeting; the other, that Father Gapon was not\r\ncoming after all, and both rumours were almost unique among the rumours\r\nI have heard in wars and revolutions, for both were true.\r\n\r\nAt last the meeting was called upon to declare whom it would have\r\nfor chairman, and one great shout went up for “Barashoff.” I do not\r\nknow who Barashoff was, or how he had gained the confidence of the\r\nwork-people, but his election was at once taken to prove that the\r\nSocial Democrats present were comparatively few. He came forward--a\r\nmiddle-aged, reddish-bearded man, with no apparent gift of voice or\r\ninfluence--and I do not know what has become of him since, or what\r\nprison received him. But there he stood beside me on the platform and\r\nannounced to the meeting that first they would sing the Hymn of the\r\nFallen, in honour to the victims of that Bloody Sunday when last they\r\nhad met together.\r\n\r\nThe whole audience rose, and stood in absolute silence till some one\r\ngave out the first note. The hymn consists of only one line, three\r\ntimes repeated, and its only words are, “To their eternal memory.” Yet\r\nall the church services I have heard were frivolous compared to it.\r\nFor it celebrated the martyrdom of men and women whom the worshippers\r\nhad known, and whose danger they had shared. I do not know what it is\r\nthat gives so profound a solemnity to Russian popular music, or how\r\nit comes that a Russian crowd produces such a deep volume of musical\r\nsound. Perhaps there is an unconscious influence from the old Church\r\nmusic, always so solemn and grave, so free from sentiment and tune.\r\nMore likely the nature of both arises from the monotonous unhappiness\r\nof Russian life, the melancholy of long oppression, and the nearness of\r\ndeath from day to day; at all events, it must have a different origin\r\nfrom the comfortable and profane spirit that produces “A little bit off\r\nthe top” or “The old bull and bush.”\r\n\r\nWhen the hymn had been sung, we were definitely told that Father Gapon\r\nwould not be present, but had sent a letter, which was read. It called\r\nupon the work-people to take courage again, and to set about rebuilding\r\nthe unions and clubs which had been destroyed by the massacre. While\r\nthe letter was being read, great excitement arose among the audience\r\nbecause police spies had been discovered among the teachers’ conference\r\nin the neighbouring hall. Spies, disguised as schoolmasters, disguised\r\nas women! Teachers are not a militant race; should not the hard-handed\r\nwork-people flow over into the conference and protect the innocent\r\ninstructors of the coming State? It is spies that drive men crazed with\r\nhatred, and even the reptile governments that use them shoot them.\r\nThat very morning the post and telegraph clerks had proclaimed that\r\nthey would never end their strike until the enormous system of spying\r\ninto letters, newspapers, and telegrams had been abolished. Of all\r\nthe methods by which a cowardly government can harass the people who\r\nfeed it, none is more despicable than the entanglement of espionage\r\nwith which it surrounds itself. But as to abolition, what would then\r\nbecome of all those swarms of censors, blackers-out, interpreters,\r\nletter-openers, secret police, cabdrivers, porters, and provocative\r\nagents who seek their meat from Government? Will not all these men\r\nstruggle for existence like others, being human creatures, though no\r\none would suppose so? Or who will pay the rent of all those houses,\r\nlike that house beside the Moika Canal where muffled figures hang\r\ncarelessly about the doors, and sledges stop for no apparent reason,\r\nand the men and women who come out have acquired the look of vultures?\r\n\r\nBut for the moment the Government which feeds the vultures was afraid\r\nfor its own skin. The police and spies slunk out of the conference\r\nwithout compulsion, and in the workmen’s meeting the five-minutes’\r\nspeeches began. They went with that extraordinary dash and fire which\r\nappear to be the common heritage of nearly all Russian speakers. How\r\nthey have managed to inherit such a power is one of the mysteries of\r\nthis mysterious revolution. In a land where public speaking has usually\r\nbeen punished by exile or death, we find a whole race of orators.\r\nCarlyle used to speak of a “great dumb Russia” with admiration, and\r\nforetell a strange time when Russia found her voice. That autumn\r\nshe had found her voice, and certainly the time was strange. One\r\nworkman after another got up and said his brief say, without pause\r\nor hesitation, inspired by that passion of conviction which only\r\nunendurable wrong can give. A woman also spoke, with similar brevity\r\nand power.\r\n\r\nThe demands made in those little speeches of condensed flame and\r\nrushing words were for rights which English workmen have long ago won\r\nfor themselves. The object of the meeting was to re-establish the\r\neleven unions of workmen which Father Gapon had instituted before the\r\nmassacre of last January. Such unions were hardly to be distinguished\r\nfrom the trade unions of our country, and there was nothing in the\r\nleast Utopian or savage about the Gapon programme. His followers\r\nrefused even to call themselves a party. They had no newspaper as their\r\norgan. The _Word_ (_Slovo_), which had once most befriended\r\nthem, had lately gone over completely to the reaction. One of the most\r\napplauded speakers at that morning’s meeting denounced the leaders who\r\nurged the workmen to organize themselves into armed bands, whereas\r\nknowledge, he said, must come before arms, and not battalions but\r\nunions must be organized. Only one other purpose remained before the\r\nmeeting--to demand complete amnesty for Father Gapon and all political\r\noffenders, especially for those who had taken on themselves the\r\nhateful task of political assassination in the time of darkness before\r\nfreedom appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a Social Democrat raised his arm and burst into a\r\nviolent and threatening speech against the meeting. Once there was a\r\ndeliberate attempt to empty the hall by a free fight, and the timid\r\nbegan edging out at the doors, chiefly under the belief that the\r\nyelling democrat who was denouncing the Gaponists was secretly an agent\r\nof the police. It may have been so, but I think he was only a Social\r\nDemocrat insisting upon the creed by which alone the Marxists would\r\ndrive the world to salvation. This Catholic kind of Social Democrat is\r\noften distinguished by a certain intolerance and pedantry which give\r\na power and consistency such as religious Catholicism has, but form a\r\nbarrier against wider sympathies and human freedom. “No salvation but\r\nby us” is their motto, and when an erring meeting cries them down, they\r\nfeel defrauded of their right to redeem mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a speaker who brought greetings from the Belgian\r\nAnarchists was politely listened to, though in the towns Russia has no\r\nAnarchist party now. Tolstoy bears an honoured name such as Rousseau\r\nbore in France, and his portrait is welcome in shop-windows; but among\r\nrevolutionists his Anarchism is too gentle, and his Christianism too\r\ndull. Outside his own circle of disciples among the peasants, the flame\r\nof his spirit may kindle many, but his actual followers are few. When\r\nevery one is remodelling the State with impassioned zeal, it seems\r\nhardly opportune to raise the question whether it is not better to have\r\nno State at all.\r\n\r\nThe speeches were over by about one, and then the meeting split up into\r\ngroups to reorganize the unions. By an arrangement among one or two\r\nfriends, we left the Salt Town separately, and gradually reassembled in\r\na room above a little restaurant, some distance away. There we found\r\nFather Gapon himself hiding from the police, with a bottle of beer\r\nbefore him, and a few supporters at his side, rather obviously his\r\ninferiors. At the time he was not afraid of political arrest. Probably\r\nDurnovo himself would hardly have dared to strike at him then. But the\r\ndanger was that he might be handed over to the Church as a renegade\r\npriest and imprisoned till death in some monastery for the good of his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nOutwardly there was little of the priest left about him then, unless\r\nit was his evident want of the commonplace kinds of knowledge that\r\nmost people have. It was said that his stay in England that summer\r\nhad changed him so much that his own friends could not recognize him,\r\nand he had been present at the meeting unobserved. But there was not\r\nreally much difference, except that he had cut his hair and beard like\r\nordinary men, and put on modern clothes instead of the survival of\r\nclassical raiment which most European priests prefer. The transparent\r\neyes of lightish brown, generally looking down or cast a little\r\nsideways--these were the same. So were the nose and thin face, the\r\nthin and delicately arched eyebrows, the thin hands and slight figure,\r\nthe blood just showing under the pale brown skin--a rare thing in a\r\nRussian; and, indeed, both by name and race I believe he comes of a\r\nDnieper Cossack or, some say, a Greek stock. If the Russian police\r\ncannot see these things, Scotland Yard could beat them. The outward\r\nlook seemed to reveal at once a delicate and sensitive nature rather\r\nthan strength of resolution or fire of purpose--one of those natures in\r\nwhich we easily detect the child still lying hid beneath the maturity\r\nof manhood. Something of a child’s craft, perhaps, lay there too, and\r\nof a woman’s methods, unwilling to be hated or despised even by the\r\nenemy. Equally childlike was that evident love of pleasure which made\r\nhim rejoice in Paris and London as in glorious bazaars where the toys\r\nwere all real things, and the dolls were living women, all made to\r\nsqueak and shut their eyes.\r\n\r\nYet this was the man who struck the first blow at the heart of tyranny\r\nand made the old monster sprawl. At first, perhaps, his heart was\r\nsimpler in its ignorance, and pleasure, being unknown, did not move\r\nhim. But when theorists condemned him for opportunism, as they did\r\ndaily, I remembered that he, at all events, knew the work-people in\r\ntheir daily life and not as an abstract proletariat, and that he, at\r\nall events, had accomplished something. It is much to be regretted,\r\nbut it sometimes happens that the opportunist is the only man who does\r\naccomplish something.\r\n\r\nThe conversation naturally ran upon the meeting, and upon a danger to\r\nthe movement that would very likely arise from the unbending attitude\r\nof the Social Democrats, who with impracticable pride hated a Social\r\nRevolutionary more than a Grand Duke, just as true Catholics enjoyed\r\nburning a Protestant more than a pagan. To Father Gapon the great\r\ndanger before the country appeared to be the immense conflict between\r\nthe Social Democrats, representing the town work-people, and the host\r\nof peasants, numbering over four-fifths of Russia’s population. But as\r\nhe spoke, warning voices were heard, a danger appeared before us all,\r\nand suddenly the picturesque little figure had vanished, and the rest\r\nof us were drinking beer over a sleepy game of cards, till with a yawn\r\nwe rose, and one by one made our way down the busy street.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Father Gapon escaped into Finland, and France swallowed\r\nhim for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                        THE FREEDOM OF THE WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those happy weeks when freedom still was young and living, two\r\nthings ruled the country--speech and the strike, the word and the blow.\r\nThe strike was everywhere felt. No letter or telegram went or came.\r\nEach town in Russia was isolated, and the whole Empire stood severed\r\nfrom the world. Banks sent their money to Europe by special messengers,\r\nlike kings. Telegrams were carried a twenty-four hours’ journey to the\r\nfrontier. Almost every night I was down at the Warsaw station watching\r\nthe passengers, to see if any could be trusted to take a letter home.\r\nWhen I travelled further into Russia, I organized an elaborate private\r\npost by stages, engaging hotel-porters, students, lady-doctors,\r\ntram-conductors, and barmaids in my service. On one occasion the scheme\r\nworked with real success, and brought me a halfpenny paper which\r\ncost me three pounds. Later I found it best to give my own letters\r\nto Lancashire women, going home for safety--wives of the managers or\r\nengineers in cotton-mills--and they posted them under their skirts.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg, the well-to-do classes, who were losing most by\r\nthe postal strike, made a heroic effort to assist the Government and\r\nthemselves. Having first seen that strong patrols of horse and foot\r\nwere stationed at all corners of the General Post Office, and at every\r\ndoor, they organized a volunteer service of sorters among their own\r\nnumber, and one saw elegant young men and white-haired gentlemen who\r\nhad passed an honoured existence in avoiding work, now struggling to\r\nmake out how it was done. Enthusiastic girls, in the prettiest of furs\r\nand the smallest possible goloshes, hastened by eleven o’clock to\r\ntheir stools in the stuffy office, and sat there till four, with the\r\nself-sacrificing zeal of young ladies at a church bazaar. One must do\r\nsomething for one’s country when the lower classes are giving so much\r\ntrouble. So with a smile and a flash of rings, they plunged into the\r\nhonest toil of sorting the stacks of letters which had been arriving by\r\nhalf a million a day; and some of the letters reached the right address.\r\n\r\nOther strikes were of almost equal interest. In Moscow the cooks\r\nstruck, and paraded the streets with songs never heard in the\r\ndrawing-room. The waiters struck, and heavy proprietors lumbered about\r\nwith their own plates and dishes. The nursemaids struck for Sundays\r\nout. The housemaids struck for rooms with windows, instead of cupboards\r\nunder the stairs, or sections from the water-closets. Schoolboys\r\nstruck for more democratic masters and pleasanter lessons. Teachers\r\nstruck for higher pay and, I hope, for pleasanter pupils. All had\r\none’s sympathy, as all rebels necessarily have. There was a solidarity\r\nabout the grievances of all, and each movement proved how far the\r\nrevolutionary spirit had spread. The only danger was that the people\r\nwere making a good thing too common. The strike was the guillotine of\r\nthe Russian revolution in those days, and even the guillotine had once\r\nbeen worked too hard.\r\n\r\nBut at the back of the strikes and all the revolutionary movement\r\nlay the motive force of speech. In Russia, even more than in other\r\ncountries, was seen the power of the creative word. A strain of\r\nunwonted idealism has long been audible in all Russian literature, and\r\nhas led to the hope that when Russia’s hour came she would advance\r\non finer and higher lines than the more material and self-satisfied\r\npeoples of Europe. The hour seemed now to have come, and the hope to be\r\njustified. The people were drunken with ideas. After these centuries of\r\nsuppression, all Russia was revelling in a spiritual debauch of words.\r\nMeetings were held almost every night. Entrance could only be gained by\r\nticket; but crowds fought at the doors to hear discussions on the first\r\nprinciples of government, taxation, or law, just as eagerly as English\r\npeople fight for a place at a football match or an indecent farce. To\r\nRussians the power of the word was all so new and delightful. I myself\r\nremember the first and only time I listened to a debate in the House\r\nof Commons. It was the day when Mr. Wyndham was treading “with fairy\r\nfootstep” through the mazes of Irish statistics. I knew those mazes at\r\nleast as well as he did, but I have never heard anything so interesting\r\nas that debate. And for Russians to listen to a man speaking was like\r\nan escape from gaol.\r\n\r\nI had noticed it in the Strike Committee and in Gapon’s meetings.\r\nWithout practice or tradition in public speaking, Russia was suddenly\r\nfound to be a nation of orators. At all the meetings it was the\r\nsame: speaker after speaker rose, and not one of them faltered for a\r\nmoment. There was no muddle, or shyness, or hesitation--none of that\r\nweary up-and-down cadence, like riding over ridge and furrow, none of\r\nthat harking back and beating round the bush for words to which our\r\nsporting legislators of the shires have long accustomed us at home. In\r\nsome cases, no doubt, the speeches were dull; but often, even without\r\nunderstanding a thousandth part of what was said, one could tell how\r\ntrue an orator the speaker was from the breathlessness of his hearers,\r\nfrom the feeling of diffused unity in the crowd, and from the deep gasp\r\nof applause which greeted the end.\r\n\r\nThe high level of thought in the speeches might be sneered at as an\r\nidealist level by dull people who do not believe in ideas. But strength\r\nwas given to the speakers by the continual danger of the moment and the\r\nreality of the horror waiting at the door. As though apologizing for\r\nhis impertinence in taking any part in such a mighty thing as politics,\r\na workman said humbly to me once: “I know nothing but the street, the\r\nfactory, and the prison. But I would die for the movement.” When his\r\nturn came to speak, of course he spoke well. With such a training, he\r\ncould hardly fail to speak well; and as to law-making, his life was a\r\nfar more genuine preparation for it than English universities.\r\n\r\nThere was a similar outburst in newspapers as in speeches. Hitherto\r\nmost Russian journalists who were not mere hirelings, writing in\r\nsupport of the bureaucracy, had been obliged to work underground, or to\r\nwrite abroad and trust to the ruses of war for a circulation in their\r\nown country. During the six weeks after the Manifesto the change was\r\nastonishing. For a time there was not a country, except England, where\r\nthe freedom of the press was so complete. A new paper appeared almost\r\nevery other day. Now and then a number or two would be confiscated, and\r\nsometimes the paper would cease to appear for a while. The first and\r\nmost notorious case of this suspension was when a little satiric paper,\r\ncalled _The Machine Gun_ (_Pulemet_), printed a copy of the\r\nTsar’s manifesto with the impression of a bloody hand stamped upon\r\nit, and the superscription, “Signed and Sealed.” This was seized as\r\nan insult to the dynasty. The editor was imprisoned, the price of the\r\ncartoon went up from five farthings to almost as many pounds, and, when\r\nthe paper appeared again, its fame was established.\r\n\r\nBut at the time a cartoon of that kind was mainly prophetic, and most\r\nof the papers said what they pleased, and said it with seriousness and\r\nself-restraint. Among the very best was the workmen’s little paper\r\ncalled _The Russian Gazette_, sold at one farthing. It had been\r\nstarted soon after Father Gapon’s petition, and since the Manifesto\r\nonly one number had been confiscated. Written in the common workman’s\r\nlanguage which all could understand, it had a very large circulation,\r\nbut its price kept the funds low, and its news from outside was small.\r\nIn politics it called itself Social Democratic, but being concerned at\r\nfirst hand with the real workmen and their interests, it touched solid\r\nground, and its tone was the same as one heard at the meetings of the\r\nlabour delegates.\r\n\r\nNext in revolutionary influence came the _New Life_ (_Novaya\r\nZhisn_), generally known as Maxim Gorky’s paper. He certainly\r\nsupplied the money and its general policy. Sometimes he wrote a\r\nlong letter or address in it, and his present wife, the actress of\r\nhis plays, was nominally editor. But, even when Gorky was in St.\r\nPetersburg, which was very seldom, the paper was really conducted by\r\nthe poet Minsky and a few other Social Democrats of high education\r\nand theoretic knowledge. The sternest and most official organ of that\r\nsect, it followed Marx with doctrinaire exactness, and its teaching\r\nwas impeded by the stiffness and pedantry that characterize the\r\nSocial Democrats even in England. No one could question the skill and\r\nenthusiasm of its attacks upon the oligarchy and capitalists, but it\r\noften devoted more space to sour depreciation of other good Socialists\r\nwho doubted if Marx had said the last word in human history. It was\r\nlike a really clever staff officer who, on the morning of the battle,\r\ngoes from brigade to brigade telling the soldiers what fools all the\r\nother officers have made of themselves, and what an immense disaster\r\nwill ensue if his own plan of attack is not adopted. So it often\r\nhappened that the truest friends of the movement were in despair at\r\nthe vanity and exclusiveness of the _New Life_, and irretrievable\r\nopportunities passed by while its staff of editors were arranging the\r\nfuture of humanity in neat little circles and squares, as though they\r\nwere the Creator and men were as obedient as the stars. If you work on\r\nGerman first principles, you are likely to arrive at queer conclusions,\r\nbecause mankind was not made in Germany. But still there was no denying\r\nthe paper’s honesty and zeal, nor its great influence within its own\r\nwide circle of well-disposed and intelligent people.\r\n\r\n_The Son of the Country_ (_Syn Otetchestva_) was an old paper; it had\r\nbeen running off and on for nearly a century; but, since the manifesto,\r\nit had become extreme in its Liberalism, and could be grouped as a new\r\npaper among the Social Democratic organs. All Russians admitted that\r\nit was particularly well written, and being far less pedantic than the\r\n_New Life_, it was read by every advanced party and promised to become\r\none of the strongest papers of the revolution.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still in St. Petersburg, at the end of November, some of\r\nthe famous exiles, who had begun to return to Russia under the promised\r\namnesty, started a paper called the _Beginning_ (_Natchalo_).\r\nIt was distinctly Social Democratic, and perhaps the leading spirit on\r\nit was Vera Sassoulitch, who had failed in an attempt to assassinate\r\nTrepoff’s father during the most gloomy period of tyranny, twenty\r\nyears before. She had returned from Geneva, old and grey and wrinkled,\r\nbut almost any night she was to be seen sitting out the revolutionary\r\nmeetings, talking, writing, or stitching with unflagging energy, and on\r\nher face and in her pale grey eyes a fixed and beaming smile, as though\r\nat the fulfilment of hopes for which she and so many others had been\r\nwilling to give their lives.\r\n\r\nNot definitely connected with social democracy, but extreme in its\r\nopposition to the Government, there was another new paper called _Our\r\nLife_ (_Nacha Zhisn_), which was started in September and at\r\nonce was recognized for its excellent news and management. It has since\r\nincreased its reputation, and become one of the leading papers in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nBut at that time perhaps the very best of all the papers, both for news\r\nand leading articles, was _Russia_ (_Russ_). It had been\r\nfounded three years before, but began to redate its numbers from the\r\nManifesto of October 30th. During the war, it won a reputation by an\r\noverwhelming exposure of army scandals, and under the movement it was\r\nalmost universally read for its progressive policy and fearlessness of\r\nspeech. At the time, it was edited by one of the sons of Suvorin, the\r\nfamous editor of the _Novoe Vremya_. Such divergence of political\r\nviews must have strained the conversation at the family dinner-table,\r\nand perhaps it was really a relief at home when the son was shut up in\r\nprison, and the paper appeared under the new title of _Molva_.\r\n\r\nThe two Jewish papers--the _News_ (_Novosti_) and the _Stock Exchange\r\nGazette_ (_Birshevza Viedomosti_)--were both old, one being nearly the\r\noldest paper in Russia, and the other having run twenty-five years,\r\nbut both had become very Progressive or even revolutionary. For in\r\nRussia, Jews are inevitably revolutionists, however much against their\r\nown nature, and the Stock Exchange paper was one of the most advanced\r\npolitical organs in the Empire, and had the best news.\r\n\r\nAt that time, two other Progressive papers had just been\r\nstarted--_Dawn_ (_Rassiojet_) and _Russia Renewed_ (_Obnovlionnaya\r\nRossiu_), and at Moscow, Professor Miliukoff was on the point of\r\nbringing out his new paper called _Life_ (_Zhisn_) of which I may\r\nspeak later on. But there seemed no end to the number of excellent\r\njournalists that Russia could supply, just as there seemed no end to\r\nthe number of excellent speakers. When I think of that sudden outburst\r\nof talent, I remember the saying of an Englishman who had lived thirty\r\nyears in Russia and professed a good-humoured contempt for the whole\r\npeople from the Court to the dustmen; “But unquestionably,” he always\r\nadded, “they are the most intelligent race in the world.” In reality,\r\nhowever, it was intensity of conviction and present sense of wrong\r\nwhich converted those inexperienced men into such effective writers\r\nand speakers. Where conviction is sincere, habit and training are best\r\naway, just as really sincere and original dramas should be performed\r\nonly by actors unhabituated to the stage.\r\n\r\nTo oppose these battalions of progress, there were only three or four\r\njournals on the reactionary side, and it is significant that none of\r\nthese were new and nearly all were subsidized. First came the _New\r\nTime_ (_Novoe Vremya_), almost the only Russian paper which is\r\nwell known by name outside Russia. It is the _Times_ of Russia,\r\nsteadily on the side of the Government, the reaction, and the moneyed\r\nclasses. Scornful of enthusiasm, deaf to every idea, incredulous of\r\nevery hope, always ready to impute the vilest motives to reform, it\r\nstands like an impenetrable barrier on the road of human progress.\r\nProclaiming itself the champion of stability, and taking law and order\r\nfor its motto, and the price of funds for its test, it succeeds in\r\npleasing the financier and the official, and its cynical disregard of\r\nhumanity is matched by its unquestioned influence for evil. A certain\r\ndignity of tone, combined with the excellence of its foreign news, has\r\ngiven it a reputation for sobriety and truth, but against the rights of\r\nfreedom it is virulent in its animosity, and against a leader of the\r\npeople it will welcome any libel without reserve. To discover where\r\njustice lies, one has but to take the opposite view to its own, and to\r\nagree with it is a danger-signal that one’s sense of right has gone\r\nastray. Yet in moments of deep indignation against some governmental\r\nshame, it will affect the popular tone and act the reformer’s part with\r\nwhines and deprecations. The scandals of the Japanese war were too\r\nflagrant even for its compliant worship of birth and rank, and after\r\nthe Manifesto had granted freedom of speech it began to demand that\r\nfreedom with righteous solicitude.\r\n\r\nOn the same side, though inferior in skill and reputation, stood\r\nthe _Citizen_ (_Grashdanin_), heavily subsidized by the Government,\r\nand possessing, it was said, a particular influence over the Tsar’s\r\nperplexed little mind; and the _Petersburg News_, also subsidized, but\r\nindignant none the less about the war scandals and the Grand Dukes.\r\n\r\nLast of this group came the _Word_ (_Slovo_), once famous for its\r\nviolent attacks upon errors in high places, and for its fearless\r\ndefence of freedom, especially on behalf of the Old Believers. But\r\nafter the Manifesto appeared, the tone of the paper changed, and\r\ninstead of joining like others in the joy of victory, it grew more and\r\nmore sullen and distrustful of progress. Whether money was the motive\r\nof the change, as rumour said, I did not discover, but the paper’s\r\ninfluence had to be counted among the reactionary forces, and it was a\r\nstrong paper.\r\n\r\nEven more significant than the printed daily papers were the satiric\r\nand illustrated sheets, which appeared as suddenly and in greater\r\nnumbers. Perhaps the best managed and most constant was the _Observer_\r\n(_Zritel_), but the _Signal_ (same word in Russian) was almost as\r\ngood, and below them came the _Arrows_ (_Streli_) and the _Libel_\r\n(_Strekoza_). The _Vampyre_ (same word in Russian) came later, and\r\nso did the _Sulphur_ (_Jupel_), which was the most artistic of them\r\nall, but so bloody and savage that it survived only three numbers. The\r\ncharacter of nearly all the cartoons was, indeed, bloody and savage\r\nrather than humorous. The satire was hardly ever kindly, as it has\r\nbecome in England now that politics are so seldom a matter of life and\r\ndeath. Sometimes, it is true, in those early weeks, Witte was treated\r\nwith a raillery that might be called gentle. He would be represented as\r\na cook trying in vain to make the dinner come right; or as a chemist\r\nwatching an empty bottle labelled “Constitution;” or as a brood hen\r\nsitting on an egg with the same label; or as an old nurse cherishing\r\na sickly little figure; or as an acrobat balancing on a slack-rope,\r\nwhile Trepoff held one end, and the red flags of the revolution surged\r\nbelow; or as a cunning old tailor threading his needle to stitch up\r\nthe two-headed eagle, which lay dead or stuffed on his board, while\r\nan inverted imperial diadem held the flat-iron, and the candle stood\r\nin a vodka bottle representing Witte’s spirit monopoly. But as a rule\r\nthe design was far more savage, and the savagery grew as the reaction\r\nbecame stronger, till after the Days of Moscow all the cartoons might\r\nhave been printed in blood, and most appeared in that colour. Then\r\nwe were shown the skeleton of death stalking through the devastated\r\nstreets, or the skeleton of hunger crawling upon the stage from the\r\nflies, or the Kremlin floating in blood like an island, or Dubasoff\r\nas butcher in a human meat-shop, or foul monsters brooding over\r\nthe corpses beneath the gallows of freedom. Right through its past\r\nhistory, all Russian art that counts has been either horrible or\r\nmelancholy--a thing of skeletons and vampires and desolation. The\r\nsubjects chosen by painters are cruel scenes from war or history, and\r\ndreary views of the steppe. The subjects chosen by writers are almost\r\ninvariably sad. It is part of the unbroken melancholy which pervades\r\nall Russian life, and is no less visible on the faces of the people\r\nthan in the sound of their music. And all this sorrow and savagery\r\nand blood lie at the door of a Government which has kept the people\r\npoor and depressed, exposed to the constant peril of the scourge, the\r\nprison, and secret death.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WITTE AND THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n  WITTE: “I’ve bought a pipe, and now I can’t play it.”\r\n\r\n   From _Sprut_.]\r\n\r\nOn the reactionary side, I think, the only satiric paper was the\r\n_Harlequin_ (_Chout_) and though it was fairly clever, there\r\nis an eternal law which forbids the service of satire or letters or any\r\nother form of art to the enemies of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of Liberal and revolutionary papers was but the visible\r\nsign of a grace that took many forms. In reality, perhaps, there\r\nwere even more parties than papers, and certainly there were many\r\nparties that had no paper to represent them. The Anarchists, as I have\r\nshown already, could hardly be called a party, at all events in the\r\ntowns, and no paper was occupied with the abolition of the State as a\r\nfetish, when all were insisting upon the strengthening of the State\r\nas against the government of the few. But even such a large party as\r\nthe Social Revolutionists had no organ of their own. Next to the\r\nSocial Democrats, they were the most powerful of the advanced parties.\r\nProbably they were even more numerous, but their organization was not\r\nso complete, and as they devoted themselves mainly to the peasants,\r\ntheir voice was not so loud in cities. They were the Terrorists of the\r\ntime; they were what Europe confusedly calls the Anarchists, and it was\r\nthey who kept the agents of the Government in peril of their lives. Yet\r\nthey had no paper of their own.\r\n\r\nNeither had a large and growing party of the Left Centre, which we may\r\ncall the Radical as distinguished from the Socialists. They issued a\r\nprogramme which nearly all the advanced parties would have accepted\r\nwhen the time for business came. Like all the rest, they demanded\r\nfirst a Constituent Assembly elected by universal suffrage, and beyond\r\nthat their ideal of the Russian State consisted in a single chamber, a\r\nministry chosen from the majority, home rule for Poland, Finland, the\r\nCaucasus, and the Baltic Provinces, the right of referendum, separation\r\nof Church and State, expropriation of Crown and Church lands and of\r\nprivate estates beyond a fixed maximum, free education, and a general\r\nmilitia for defence. Moderate as these demands were, nearly all the\r\nrevolutionists, except the more starchy among the Social Democrats,\r\nwould have been content to fight for them and welcome them with joy;\r\nbut the Radicals had no special organ for their views.\r\n\r\nAs in all movements of intense and vital interest, the danger to reform\r\ncame from division. All were united in their final purpose, but as to\r\nmethods and strategy the divisions of parties were many and violent. It\r\nwas the same thing as in a restaurant of Polish students to which I was\r\noften invited. There was a long, low room, furnished only with benches\r\nand tables. At one end was a piano; at the other a counter where the\r\nstudent could buy excellent meals at all hours of the day and night for\r\nvery small payment. Though the university had long been closed owing\r\nto the disturbances, the place was always crowded with young men and\r\ngirls, living in perfect comradeship and much at their ease. One night,\r\na young girl, with clear grey eyes, a demure little face, and pale hair\r\ntightly braided, was giving me a very satisfactory lecture in German\r\nupon the minute distinctions between all the Polish parties. I heard\r\nafterwards that in her zeal for knowledge, she had gained the necessary\r\npassport to St. Petersburg by going through the form of marriage with\r\na student whom she had never seen since the ceremony. It is not an\r\nunusual device, and I have known girl-students who have even taken “the\r\nyellow ticket” as prostitutes in order to reach a university town.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her disquisition, she suddenly burst into an attack\r\nupon two or three girls at another table who were suspected of\r\nbetraying true comradeship by ordinary flirtation. “I suppose they\r\nthink themselves rather pretty,” she said, “but neither logically nor\r\npsychologically do I understand their behaviour.” At that moment a few\r\nnotes sounded on the piano, and to distract her wrath I suggested she\r\nshould ask for some Polish music.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I couldn’t speak to that end of the room,” she replied; “the other\r\nparty has captured it, and the piano besides.”\r\n\r\n“But you hold the kitchen end,” I remarked consolingly.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say our possession is not exclusive,” she answered, with\r\na look that was bloodthirsty in its conviction of righteousness. Then\r\nshe took a shining revolver from her pocket, examined its action, said\r\ngood-bye to her friends, and stalked through the enemy’s camp without a\r\nsign either of fear or pardon.\r\n\r\nShe was herself a Social Democrat of the most attractive though\r\nsternest type, and as such, she believed in international fraternity.\r\nBut “the other party” were Polish Revolutionists, or Democratic Poles,\r\nor something just wrong, and they followed the old-fashioned faith of\r\nnationality; and so the room was split by an invisible but impassable\r\nbarrier. To me it all seemed rather a pity, when I thought of the long\r\nyears of conflict which must pass before they reached the separating\r\npoint in their ideals, and how few would live to see a single item in\r\ntheir programme fulfilled. Yet I know that at the first note of the\r\nrevolution, Social Democrats, Polish Revolutionists, Democratic Poles,\r\nflirtatious girls, and all would be ready to die together for Poland’s\r\nfreedom. And so probably they will have to die.\r\n\r\nIt was the same throughout the length and breadth of Russia in those\r\nhappy weeks. Divisions are the evidences of life, and Russia was\r\nseething with life like the world in the days of creation. But one\r\nthought exhilarated all young and happy minds--the thought of liberty.\r\nAnd if to a middle-aged man and a stranger in the country it was a joy\r\nthen to be alive, to the young and to the Russian it must indeed have\r\nbeen very heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DIARY OF EVENTS\r\n\r\n   _December 6._--General Sakharoff, who had succeeded\r\n   Kuropatkin as Minister of War, and had lately been appointed\r\n   Governor-General of the Saratoff district on the Volga, was shot\r\n   in his office at Saratoff by a woman, a Social Revolutionist,\r\n   who said, when she was arrested, “Now he can cause the peasants\r\n   no more suffering.”\r\n\r\n   _December 7._--The Strike Committee (Central Labour\r\n   Committee in St. Petersburg) called on the work-people to\r\n   withdraw their money from the savings-banks. They rightly\r\n   believed that bankruptcy was the best way of overthrowing the\r\n   Government.\r\n\r\n   _December 9._--Khroustoloff, the President of the Strike\r\n   Committee, and three other leading delegates were arrested at\r\n   the Printers’ Union and imprisoned.\r\n\r\n   At this time severe fighting was renewed in the Caucasus between\r\n   the Tartars and Armenians.\r\n\r\n   There was also a violent outbreak of revolution in Riga, and the\r\n   Letts of the three Baltic Provinces of Esthonia, Livonia, and\r\n   Courland, rose against the Government, and burnt some of the\r\n   country houses belonging to German landowners who had inherited\r\n   estates from the Teutonic Orders of Knight and other Prussian\r\n   conquerors in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n   _December 16._--The Council of Workmen’s Delegates (Strike\r\n   Committee), combined with the Committee of the Peasants’\r\n   Congress, the Committee of the Social Democratic Workmen’s\r\n   Party, and the Committee of the Social Revolutionists, issued\r\n   another manifesto on Government finance. The following extracts\r\n   show its tendency:--\r\n\r\n   “The Government is on the verge of bankruptcy. With the capital\r\n   obtained by foreign loans, it has built railways and fleets\r\n   and fortresses, and supplied itself with arms. The foreign\r\n   sources of capital are now dried up. The Government orders have\r\n   ceased, and the merchants and factory-owners, accustomed to\r\n   enrich themselves at the expense of the State, are closing their\r\n   offices. No one is sure of the morrow.\r\n\r\n   “The Government has wasted all the State revenues on the\r\n   army and the fleet. There are no schools, and the roads are\r\n   neglected. Troops throughout the country are disaffected,\r\n   impoverished, and hungry. The Government has robbed the State\r\n   savings-banks. The capital of small investors has been played\r\n   with on the Bourse. The gold reserve of the State Bank is\r\n   insignificant compared with the demands of the State loans and\r\n   commercial transactions.\r\n\r\n   “The Government covers the interest on old loans by contracting\r\n   new loans. Year by year it publishes false estimates of the\r\n   revenue and expenditure, so as to show a surplus instead of the\r\n   real deficit.\r\n\r\n   “Only after the fall of the autocracy can a Constituent Assembly\r\n   put an end to this financial ruin. The national representatives\r\n   must then liquidate the debts as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n   “There is but one way out of this abyss--the overthrow of the\r\n   Government, and the removal of its last weapon. We must take\r\n   from it the last source of its existence--its financial revenue.\r\n\r\n   “The Government is issuing orders against the people as though\r\n   Russia were a conquered country. We have decided not to allow\r\n   the payment of debts contracted by the Tsar’s Government, since\r\n   it has openly waged war against the whole nation.\r\n\r\n   “We call on you to withdraw your deposits from the savings\r\n   banks, and to refuse to pay taxes, or to take banknotes, or to\r\n   subscribe to loans.”\r\n\r\n   This manifesto showed how clearly the leaders of the working\r\n   classes realized that the control of finance is the basis of\r\n   political power.\r\n\r\n   The Government recognized it too, and took immediate measures.\r\n\r\n   On the 14th the Tsar had proclaimed “his inflexible will to\r\n   realize with all possible speed the reforms he had granted.”\r\n\r\n   On the 16th came a Government message denouncing “the groups who\r\n   are threatening the Government, society, and all the population\r\n   who do not share their views,” and threatening imprisonment\r\n   against all strikers and inciters to strike.\r\n\r\n   That evening the hall of the Free Economic Society, which I\r\n   described in the first chapter, was surrounded by troops and\r\n   police. Three hundred men and women were arrested, and two\r\n   hundred and sixty-four of them were imprisoned, including twenty\r\n   of the Executive.\r\n\r\n   At the same time the editors of all the papers which had\r\n   published the Committee’s manifesto were arrested, and their\r\n   papers suppressed. Of the leading dailies, only the reptile\r\n   _Novoe Vremya_ continued to appear.\r\n\r\n   _December 18._--An entirely new council and executive were\r\n   appointed for the Strike Committee, and at once they determined\r\n   on another general strike. “The Government has declared civil\r\n   war,” ran the decree, “and, as it wants war, it shall have it.”\r\n\r\n   In the mean time, on December 8th, I had gone to Moscow, and it\r\n   was to Moscow that the centre of revolution now shifted. But\r\n   before I take up the narrative of the rising in that city, I\r\n   will describe a few days’ visit I made from there into the open\r\n   country and the villages where peasants live. The change in the\r\n   order of date is unimportant, and the story of Moscow can then\r\n   follow continuously.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PEASANT SLEDGES.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A PRIVATE SLEDGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                             THE OPEN LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the waning moon, before the dawn of a December day, I drove out\r\nof the town of Toula in my tiny sledge--so close to the snow that\r\nthe great black horse with his high yoke looked monstrous in the\r\ntwilight. It is a typical Russian town, about a hundred miles south of\r\nMoscow, and as nearly as possible in the centre of the country. Two\r\ngreat roads cross each other there, and pass on to the points of the\r\ncompass. Oldish churches, surrounded by a fortified wall, make a kind\r\nof Kremlin. Ancient houses conceal cavernous shops in the thickness\r\nof their own walls. Across a wooden bridge stands the Government\r\nsmall-arms factory, with workmen’s villages beyond. Strange figures in\r\nfilthy rags moved up and down, beggars and shaggy peasants, high-school\r\nboys, and fur-capped girls. It has long been rather a revolutionary\r\nlittle town, and during the strike, ten days before, nineteen workmen\r\nhad been shot upon the street.\r\n\r\nIn spite of solemn warnings, I had come out from the cities to see\r\nsomething of the country, having with difficulty induced a ruined\r\nGerman-Russian to venture with me as interpreter, for the sake of\r\nbread. As usual, the danger was nothing compared to the fear. What\r\ndanger there was in the villages came from the police agents and\r\nofficials, who hounded on the peasants with the cry that every stranger\r\nwas a revolutionist conspiring against the Tsar to rob them of God and\r\nthe land. For in those progressive days the police were dreading lest\r\nthey should lose their livelihood of flogging and brutality at fifteen\r\nshillings a week.\r\n\r\nMy road went uphill to a high and bare plain, over which the snow was\r\ndriven by the wind in showers so blinding that the horse kept turning\r\nround and appealing to us as reasonable beings to return. Horizon,\r\nroad, and every mark were lost in whirling grey. But, after we had\r\nstruggled on for two or three hours, the snow ceased to fall, and the\r\nwintry sun appeared low in the sky, making the distant ridges of the\r\nwide country shine with pale crimson or gleam like a far-off sea.\r\nMost of the land was bare and open ground, the snow blotting out the\r\n“stripes” where the peasants grew their crops in summer. But as we went\r\nfurther, lengths of forest came into view, looking brown at a distance,\r\nthough generally made up of young silver birch, their silky white stems\r\nflecked with black. Birch woods supply the fuel of the country; next to\r\nfood, the first necessity of the peasant’s life. There was some oak,\r\nbut very little fir or pine. The birch in this region is the favourite,\r\neither because it grows best or burns best; and it is almost the only\r\nfuel in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe peasants’ wooden sleighs passing to and fro bore loads of sawn\r\nbirch, dragged by miserable little ponies, so caked with mire that\r\ntheir coats looked like a crocodile’s armour. At their side floundered\r\nthe peasants in sheepskin jackets, with the wool side turned inwards.\r\nThe jacket was gathered with a belt round the waist, and the skirt\r\nstuck out all round, reaching to the knees. Then came the high\r\ntop-boots of felt or bast, rarely of leather. Men and women were not\r\nto be distinguished, except that, instead of a cap, the women usually\r\nwore a handkerchief or shawl knotted over head and ears. There was no\r\nspecial grace about the costume; but even the rich ladies of Russian\r\ncities find it hard to appear graceful when padded round with fur and\r\nwool six or seven inches deep. At the best, they can only appear rich.\r\n\r\nBeside the road at one place stood a mouldering wooden inn\r\n(_tractir_), where passers-by could get thawed and have a glass\r\nof tea at three farthings. The owner of the estate, being something\r\nof a philanthropist or a teetotaller for others, had forbidden beer\r\nand spirits, so that the innkeeper was pale with anxiety how to pay\r\nhis £4 rent, to say nothing of the taxes. Should he borrow, and go to\r\nruin that way, or allow himself to be flogged to prove his poverty? I\r\nsuggested that times were changing, and flogging might cease, but he\r\nonly smiled with the politeness of superior knowledge. “No flogging, no\r\ntaxes,” was to him the law of government.\r\n\r\nIn one corner hung three great icons, or holy pictures of the saints,\r\nglittering with tin and brass--very different in size and expense from\r\nthe miniature icon which hangs in every bedroom of the wealthy Russian\r\nhotels, as a kind of apology to God, like our grace at a City dinner.\r\nOtherwise, there was no ornament in the house, except one of those\r\nill-omened iron mugs, for which the crowd crushed each other to death\r\non the coronation day of the present unhappy Tsar, nine years before,\r\nwhen the plain of Khodinsky Polé, on the north-west outskirts of\r\nMoscow, stood thick with suffocated peasants.\r\n\r\nI next passed a great smelting works, newly finished, its fine furnaces\r\nand machinery never used, but already deserted and allowed to go\r\nto ruin. I could not discover whose money had been devoted to this\r\ncharacteristic fraud, or into whose pockets it had passed. Then came a\r\nfew small gardens and summer residences built on the Crown land; for\r\nmost of the land in that district is part of the Tsar’s vast estates,\r\namounting to a fortieth part of the whole of European Russia, not\r\ncounting the landed property of the Imperial family. But all the\r\nhouses were deserted and empty, and one was burnt, and smouldered still.\r\n\r\nDriving further on, I came to a large country house, where one of the\r\nancient families of the Russian nobility was still living in the midst\r\nof its own land. I happened to be bringing them letters from friends,\r\nas the post was not working, and I found a house-party there, beguiling\r\nthe winter day with much the same occupations as a house-party in\r\nEngland--doing embroidery, playing battledore with racquets and a\r\nsoft ball, pushing a marble up a kind of bagatelle-board, examining\r\ntheir guns, and taking the dogs for walks in the woods. At a wandering\r\nluncheon of various courses, they maintained a quiet converse, marked\r\nby the gracious silliness, the “cheerful stoicism,” which is the\r\njustification of the aristocrat’s existence.\r\n\r\nIt was all a fine piece of self-reserve, for inwardly their mood was\r\nserious and apprehensive. They had just heard that the country-house of\r\na friend and neighbour had been burnt to the ground by his peasants,\r\nthough the family had escaped with their lives. One of the ladies had a\r\nson in the army, and they had just heard of a terrible riot and mutiny\r\nin his garrison town. Another lady’s son had married a rich heiress,\r\nand they had just heard that the three country residences of her\r\nparents had been utterly destroyed by the peasants, and now she was\r\nrich no more. From every side came tales of loss and danger, and no one\r\ncould say what the end would be.\r\n\r\nFor themselves, they were just waiting helplessly to see what would\r\nhappen. Polite, charming, highly educated, well dressed, healthy, fond\r\nof sport and country life, full of good will and high intentions,\r\nthey were so like our own country squires and aristocracy at their\r\nbest--so like the people who used to be held up to us as the school\r\nof manners and the producers of the fine old English stock--that only\r\nthe dreariest of Social Democrats could have refused them sympathy.\r\nThey were themselves fairly conscious of the absurdities in their own\r\nposition, but the only protest or complaint that they made was to\r\nsay they were getting a little tired of perpetual parallels between\r\nthemselves and the aristocrats of the French Revolution, whose heads\r\nwere cut off so rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon my sledge took me further into the unlimited and\r\ndesolate country, till at last we came to a village fairly typical of\r\nthat district--not a rich part of Russia nor yet so starving poor as\r\nthe famine provinces which lay close by it. The village was built in\r\none long street, with about forty separated cottages on each side.\r\nA few of the cottages had bits of brick in the walls or round the\r\nwindows, but wood was almost the only building material, and the\r\nroofs, though sometimes of flat iron plates, painted green, were\r\ngenerally thatched. In this particular village there was no school\r\nand no church, but from the high ground above it I could see a church\r\nabout two miles off, and that, no doubt, was near enough. There were\r\ntwo shops and an inn, all just like the other cottages. Each house had\r\na separate wattle shed near it, for fodder, stores, and perhaps to\r\nshelter the beasts in summer. In winter they have to be brought into\r\nthe dwelling-house for warmth.\r\n\r\nBy the invitation of a peasant I went into his cottage. The man was\r\nrather above the ordinary type, being tall and straight. But he had\r\nthe thoughtful and quiet look of the average peasant, as well as the\r\nlong, dark hair and shaggy appearance. His wife was quite the usual\r\nwoman--short, ungainly, and possessing no visible beauty except,\r\nperhaps, patience. On the faces of both was the green look of hunger,\r\nalmost invariable in the peasants I have seen. The outside door of the\r\nhouse opened into the cattle-room, where a sickly cow was dragging out\r\nthe winter. There was room for a horse, but the people had been obliged\r\nto sell their horse that autumn to pay the taxes and their debts to the\r\nKoulak or village usurer. From the Koulak, too, I suppose, they would\r\nborrow the money to hire another horse in the summer, as they said they\r\nintended. For no peasant can get through his work without a horse.\r\n\r\nA wooden partition separated the cattle from the dwelling-room, the\r\nhouse being designed exactly like an Irish cabin, except that the\r\nwhite brick construction of the stove projected on both sides of the\r\npartition, thus warming the cow and the family both. As every one\r\nknows, the peasant’s stove is a large and wonderful edifice, full of\r\nmysterious holes and caverns for cooking and baking, and even for the\r\ndry roasting process which serves the family as a bath. Close beside it\r\nwere two broad, wooden shelves on which the inmates slept--the parents\r\nabove, the five children underneath. There was no bedding of any kind,\r\nexcept one worn coverlet or shawl on each shelf.\r\n\r\nThe children had made their shelf into a day-nursery as well as a bed,\r\nfor they were all rolling about on it and biting each other, imagining\r\na game of wolf, I think, though wolves are not common there. All were\r\nbare-legged, and quite naked but for loose red shirts reaching to their\r\nknees. Of course, they went out sometimes, but there were not enough\r\nclothes to send them all out together at once in winter. The furniture\r\nof the home was a wooden box, which was the seat of honour, a short\r\nbench, a table, and a small wooden loom, on the universal model of\r\nprimitive manufacture. Both man and woman could weave, and they were\r\nmaking yards of a coarse stuff dyed with red madder, exactly the same\r\nas the women make for their petticoats on Achill Island.\r\n\r\nProbably the loom brought in an important part of the family’s income,\r\nfor the sale of the horse showed that they could not live off the\r\nland alone. Yet the man boasted that his bit of land, on which he\r\ngrew potatoes, oats, and rye, was his absolute property, and when I\r\ntried to ask him whether the village community did not redistribute\r\nhis land with the rest every twelve years, as I had read in books, he\r\nbecame very violent and showed no scientific interest at all in the\r\nsociological importance of the Mir. The working of the Mir was the only\r\nthing I thought I did understand when I came to Russia, and it was\r\ndisconcerting to find that the first peasant I spoke to had never heard\r\nof such an arrangement. I still do not know what mistake he or I can\r\nhave made. He may have been only insisting on the peasant’s touching\r\nfaith that the land is the natural possession of the man who cultivates\r\nit, and can never be taken from him, even by the Tsar. Anyhow, he was\r\nterribly afraid that I had come to shake that belief in some way, and I\r\nthought it best to turn the conversation to the cow.\r\n\r\nAs to the Tsar’s recent promise to remit next year half the annual\r\npayment still due to the Treasury for the original purchase of the\r\nland, this peasant, in common, I believe, with all others, thought\r\nnothing of it. To them the manifesto was so much “dirty paper.” They\r\nknew very well that even if half were remitted, the Crown agents would\r\ncome down upon them for arrears. They also knew dimly that since the\r\nliberation of the serfs more than forty years ago, the peasants have\r\npaid the extreme value of the land twice over. So they have ceased to\r\nconcern themselves about any manifesto which does not surrender to them\r\nthe mass of land which they regard as rightfully theirs.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in the cottage, an old man came up with a canvas bag over\r\nhis shoulder, and knocked at the door. Though obviously in the sink of\r\npoverty, he was not a professional beggar, but only one of that large\r\nclass of peasants who are driven by age or misfortune to go round the\r\nvillages and ask for scraps to keep them alive till better times.\r\nAccordingly he came in as if for a friendly call, laid his bag on the\r\ntable with its mouth open, and joined in the conversation. When we were\r\ngoing out again, the woman slipped some squares of black bread into\r\nthe bag as though by stealth, and he took it up and walked off without\r\nfurther remark on either side. It was the perfection both of appeal and\r\nkindliness.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TOLSTOY’S HOME.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PEASANTS.]\r\n\r\nAt parting, I looked again at the peasant and his wife, in their clean\r\npoverty, with the marks of their almost passionate labour upon them\r\nand their five children growing up round their knees, and certainly it\r\ndid seem incredible that these were just the people who are marched\r\noff to the village police-court, are tied face downwards to a sloping\r\nbench, have their clothes turned up, and are flogged with whips or\r\nrods by officials and police because they cannot pay the taxes for the\r\nJapanese war, or for the interest on the French loans.\r\n\r\nYet, in the last resort, it is upon violence almost as brutalizing and\r\nindecent that all Empires are founded, and I was all the more ready\r\nto welcome what Tolstoy said to me next day, when he received me--as\r\ngenerously as he receives every one--in his “Bright Home” (_Jasnaia\r\nPoliana_) as the country-house is called. He told me that, among the\r\nmany other plans of work which he could not live to finish, he was then\r\nengaged on a book to be called “The End of an Age.”\r\n\r\n“You are young and I am old,” he said, “but as you grow older you will\r\nfind, as I have found, that day follows day, and there does not seem\r\nmuch change in you, till suddenly you hear people speaking of you as an\r\nold man. It is the same with an age in history; day follows day, and\r\nthere does not seem to be much change, till suddenly it is found that\r\nthe age has become old. It is finished, it is out of date.\r\n\r\n“The present movement in Russia is not a riot, it is not even a\r\nrevolution, it is the end of an age. And the age that is ending is the\r\nage of Empires--the collection of smaller States under one large State.\r\nThere is no true community of heart or thought between Russia, Finland,\r\nPoland, the Caucasus, and all our other States and races. Or what have\r\nHungary, Bohemia, and Styria, or the Tyrol to do with Austria? No more\r\nthan Canada, Australia, India, or Ireland have to do with England.\r\nPeople are now beginning to see the absurdity of these things, and\r\nin the end people are reasonable. That is why the age of Empires is\r\npassing away.\r\n\r\n“They tell me, for instance, that if the Russian Empire ceased to\r\nexist, swarms of Japanese would overrun our country and destroy our\r\nrace. But the Japanese also are reasonable people, and if they came and\r\nfound how much better off we were without any Empire at all, they would\r\ngo home and imitate our example.”\r\n\r\nThe whole argument, which ran on with a half-ironic simplicity of this\r\nkind, was magnificent, not so much for its daring as for its quiet\r\nconfidence in human reason. I remembered how for the last twenty years\r\nall the brazen trumpets of vulgarity had been sounding the note of\r\nEmpire over us as the one great and stirring purpose of existence.\r\nAnd here was this rugged old man calmly telling me, as though it\r\nwere something of a platitude, that we had just come to the end of\r\nan age--the age of Empires. There he sat in the familiar grey shirt\r\nwithout coat or collar, the belt round the waist, and the high leather\r\ntop-boots (for he had just tramped round his land in the snow), quietly\r\nfollowing out the exact logic of his principles, no matter where it\r\nmight lead him. He was seventy-seven, and in terms of years one was\r\nforced, as he said, to call him old. The spirit had retired more deeply\r\ninto the shrunk and wrinkled form. But under the shaggy brows, the\r\ngrey-green eyes still looked out with the clearness of profound thought\r\nand fearless simplicity which have made him the greatest rebel in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs to the present condition of his own country, he believed, as is well\r\nknown from his writings, that the return of the land to the peasants\r\nis the only possible cure for Russia’s misery. He told me that he\r\nwould accept Henry George’s method of nationalization, or any other\r\nwhich gave the peasants a true hold on the land they work. He quoted\r\nKropotkin’s investigations into “intensive culture” to prove that,\r\nwith improved methods, there is plenty of land in Russia to maintain\r\nan immensely increased population. As things stood, less than a third\r\nof the cultivated land was held by peasants or village communities,\r\nand less than a quarter of the cultivable land was used at all. The\r\nTsar should at once restore the land to the peasants. With their long\r\nexperience of the communal system, they could then manage very well\r\nfor themselves without any State at all, as they had successfully\r\nproved in the Siberian colonies; for communism ran in the Russian\r\nblood, and its ideal had never been lost in the country.\r\n\r\nWhen I suggested that a town question had also arisen now, besides the\r\nclaim of peasants to the land, he admitted that town influence was the\r\ngreatest danger. “Towns,” he said, “are the places where mankind has\r\nbegun to rot, and unhappily the rottenness spreads. The mistake of our\r\nLiberal politicians in the towns is that they are always preaching the\r\nblessings of some English or American constitution. But constitutions\r\nof that kind, having once been realized, have already become things\r\nof the past. They belong to a different age from ours, and an ideal,\r\nwhether in statesmanship or art, is never a thing of the past, but\r\nalways of the future. For Russia as she exists now, we ought to aim at\r\nsomething entirely different from your worn-out methods of government.”\r\n\r\nSo he conversed through the winter morning, eager to speak, and as\r\neager to hear. He asked much about Central Africa from which I had\r\nlately returned, and much about the new national movement in Ireland,\r\nnor should I have been surprised if he had continued the conversation\r\nin Gaelic, so fresh and vigorous was his interest in the world. Only\r\nwhen I told him rather carelessly, that the intellectual movement\r\nthere was producing a large number of poets, his face fell, and he\r\nturned to other things, merely remarking that poets were very little\r\ngood. In passing, he said he had been pleased to find that his fellow\r\nPuritan, Mr. Bernard Shaw, thought very lightly of Shakespeare, in whom\r\nhe had never himself discovered any satisfaction, though he had read\r\nhim once all through in English, and twice in German.\r\n\r\nBut it was not his interest in the common affairs of the world that\r\ngave him his true attraction. Apart from all this, there hung over\r\nhim that separate and distinguishing grace which our fathers called\r\nsanctity and considered a thing to be worshipped. It was the grace of\r\na toilsome and abstemious life, unflinchingly devoted to one high aim,\r\nand sacrificing all worldly pleasure and success to an ideal which\r\ncould never be reached. I believe the modern name for it is fanaticism.\r\n\r\nI say one high aim, for I see no reason to agree with the many critics\r\nwho draw a sharp dividing line in his career and in the process of\r\nhis mind. All the principles of his later teaching are to be found\r\nillustrated in the two great imaginative works of his earlier manhood,\r\nand if there is any fault to be found with a life so courageous and\r\ninspiring, I should seek it only in a rather inhuman and remorseless\r\nconsistency of reason--a logic which, having for instance, condemned\r\nthe pleasures of sense, would doom the human race to rapid extinction\r\nbecause life cannot be maintained and handed on without pleasure. But\r\nsuch returns to the strict Christianity of earlier centuries ought not\r\nto astonish people who call themselves Christians, especially as there\r\nseems no danger at present that the logic of their teaching will be\r\nfollowed in human action. And, in any case, I should rather leave it to\r\nothers to reveal such limitations as they may find in so beneficient\r\nand gracious a personality.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TOLSTOY IN MIDDLE AGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                          THE STATE OF MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Saturday, December 9th, the day after I had arrived\r\nin Moscow, I happened to be passing the unfinished buildings of the\r\nempty University. Minute snow was lashing through the air before a\r\nbitter wind, but it thawed as it fell, and people in goloshes went\r\nslopping about among the filthy puddles of the street.\r\n\r\nTrailing in disorder through the dirt and wind, mixed up with the\r\nmarket people and the little open cabs like sledges that were always\r\ndashing up and down with men and women in furs, came a loose string\r\nof soldiers, slowly making their way westward. They had just passed\r\nthe canvas booths where butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers and other\r\nloyalists set upon the students with knives the month before; they had\r\nreached the point where the soldiers from behind walls fired blindly\r\ninto the thick of the unarmed procession which accompanied the funeral\r\nof the student Baumann. There they halted, because the cross road which\r\npasses the great Riding School Barrack and cuts the University in half\r\nwas blocked with traffic, and then a few passers-by began to look at\r\nthem curiously.\r\n\r\nThey were not to be called a column, nor were they organized as an\r\nadvanced party. They were not organized at all; but a few cavalry came\r\nfirst, their hairy little horses throwing up a steam into the wind;\r\nthen a few straggling infantry--not more than half a battalion--covered\r\nwith filth, their uniforms torn and patched, some in low, flat caps\r\nlike our own men, some in high, furry caps, matted with mud and snow.\r\nAnd under the caps were faces yellow, thin, and as though bemused with\r\nwonder. Behind the infantry followed a rambling line of various kinds\r\nof cart, and inside the carts were stretched muffled and pallid forms,\r\ntheir heads or arms or feet bound up with dirty and blood-stained\r\nbandages.\r\n\r\nThese were the soldiers returning from the war, the van and first\r\ninstalment of that great and ruined army coming home. At last they had\r\ncompleted the 5000 or 6000 miles of their journey from the starving\r\nEast, across the frozen lake, and through the long Siberian plains, and\r\nwere alive in the heart of their own country again. And this was how\r\nthey were received. Certainly, the Moscow municipality had intended to\r\narrange some sort of festivities at the station. They had intended to\r\ngive little presents to the men--something in the shape of chocolates\r\nand cigarettes that comfort the hearts of heroes. They had prepared\r\nlittle decorations for the officers, with the inscription, “To the\r\ndefenders of the country.” But whether these festivities were ever held\r\nand these little presents given, no one could tell me. The papers had\r\nannounced that the army from the Far East would begin to arrive on the\r\nSunday. The paternal Government took care that they should arrive on\r\nthe Saturday.\r\n\r\nProbably the town officials retained for themselves their little\r\nofferings to patriotism, and will wear the war decorations with pride\r\nat family parties. So little interest was taken in the whole thing that\r\nthe evening papers continued to announce that the army would begin to\r\narrive on the morrow. The market people and cabdrivers stopped for a\r\nmoment to look at them before hurrying on through the snow, and no\r\nfurther notice of any kind was taken of the defenders of the country.\r\n\r\nSo they drifted westward, down the dirty streets, and disappeared. On\r\nreaching the barracks, the Reservists among them were discharged, and\r\nthe crowds of beggars who, with threats and curses, violently demanded\r\nthe milk of human kindness at every corner, were increased by many\r\ntattered figures. They limped about in traces of departed uniforms,\r\nand as they passed, people said, “A soldier from the war.” One night\r\nI saw two or three of them seated on a curb-stone beside a fire which\r\nhad been lighted in a street. One was swaying gently backwards and\r\nforwards and continually repeating, “At home and alive! at home and\r\nalive!” The others took no notice, but stared like imbeciles into the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nSome were drafted back by rail to their villages, and the terror\r\nof comfortable people was that they would there spread the tale of\r\nmismanagement, corruption, and misery till all the peasants would rise\r\nin fury and sweep upon the cities in ravenous and overwhelming hordes.\r\nSometimes a dim rumour reached us from the Far East of a distracted\r\narmy, mutinous and starving; maddened with hardship and the longing for\r\nhome, but unable to crowd into the worn-out trains that crept along\r\nthose thousands of miles of single line, choked with stores and blocked\r\nby continual accidents and strikes. If they should all come home--all\r\nthe 500,000 or 600,000 of them at once? The comfortable citizens--and\r\neven in Moscow there were such people--shuddered in their furs and\r\nthanked Heaven for the difficulties of that narrow road.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a big manufacturer told me he was delighted to see\r\nthe army returning. “For now,” he said, “the Reservists on garrison\r\nduty here will be dismissed, and we can always trust the Line to obey\r\ntheir officers and shoot in defence of law and order.” At the time I\r\nhoped he was over-sanguine. In Russia there is no caste of soldiers\r\nas with us. All come from the people, and in a year or two will\r\nreturn to the people. The Line are exactly the same kind of men as\r\nthe Reservists, only younger. Of course, it might happen that, being\r\nyounger, they would more likely obey, for to most people obedience is\r\nthe easiest thing to do, and a young man in uniform is almost sure to\r\nfall into it. But for the moment that was to me just the one question\r\nof the future; would the Line obey their officers and shoot in defence\r\nof law and order?\r\n\r\nThere were rumours about the disaffection of a good many battalions.\r\nThe Rostoff regiment got up a little mutiny on its own account one\r\nday, and planted guns at the corners of their barracks, but they were\r\nsoon won back by promises of bodily comfort. For the rest, the troops\r\npatrolled the streets in mounted and unmounted parties day and night,\r\nbut no one knew whether they represented a Government or not. Their\r\nchief duties were concentrated round the great block of Post Office\r\nbuildings. For all day long large groups of postal clerks and officials\r\non strike were gathered upon the pavements there, like working bees\r\naround a ruined hive, and in the neighbouring boulevard gardens, where\r\ngirls and children skated, they assembled in eager controversy.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning (December 11th), I saw there a feeble little\r\nattempt to rush a mail-cart starting for the provinces, or for the St.\r\nPetersburg station, under mounted escort. In a moment two Cossack\r\npatrols wheeled round and dashed at full gallop into the crowd,\r\nstriking blindly at the nearest heads with the terrible nagaikas\r\nor loaded whips which I described before. Where the patrols had\r\npassed, men, women, and little girls, lay felled to the ground or\r\nstood screaming with pain while blood ran down their faces. Pushing,\r\nstumbling, and scrambling for life, the crowd fled in panic before\r\nthe stroke of the hoofs and the whirling whips. Then I knew that\r\nuntil they could face violence with some sort of organized front, the\r\nrevolutionists had better stay at home. Against twenty men in uniform,\r\nfive hundred had no chance. As a gigantic Caucasian cried in scorn the\r\nnight before to a meeting of peaceful and scientific Social Democrats,\r\n“The party that commands force is the Government.” Who would command\r\nforce was at that time the most important question in Russia, and no\r\none was certain how it should be answered from day to day.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary affairs of life we enjoyed liberty tempered by\r\nassassination. The advance from tyranny supported by execution was\r\nimmeasurable, and it had all been accomplished in about six weeks. In\r\nthat old city, the natural centre of Russian life both by position and\r\ntrade, were gathered some 1,100,000 souls who had never known liberty\r\nbefore, either in politics, economics, or thought. It was very natural\r\nthat they should not know exactly what to make of the change at\r\nfirst. The surprising thing was to see how rapidly their instinct for\r\norganization and self-government developed, especially in the working\r\nclasses. Whether one ought to trace this faculty to the old habit of\r\nthe village community among the peasants, I am not sure. But I think it\r\ncertain that the feeling for association and common action--the feeling\r\nof “mutual aid” as Kropotkin calls it--is very widely extended among\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nEvery one was then waiting for the next step in history, and the\r\nwildest rumours flew. At every corner and in every restaurant stood\r\nprophets foretelling the fates, and winning the momentary applause of\r\ndelight or terror. But, except for such rewards, the time of prophets\r\nwas not more valuable than usual, and for ordinary people, whose\r\nperceptions are blind to futurity, the real points of interest were\r\nstill the postal strike and the rapid formation of unions. The loss\r\nto friendship and business owing to the cessation of letters was so\r\nsevere, that the leaders of finance and commerce in Moscow drew up\r\na petition to Witte and Durnavo, urging them to grant the economic\r\ndemands, especially the right of union, even if no political demands\r\nwere considered. The Government replied with a manifesto dismissing one\r\nthousand of the postal strikers offhand, and making all strikes among\r\nGovernment servants a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nThe hardship was great. Many of the strikers had served fifteen years\r\nor more, and were entitled to pensions, which they now lost. Many\r\nlived in Government quarters, from which they were now evicted. The\r\nProgressives certainly did all that they could to assist them. At all\r\nlectures and meetings, such as were held in various parts of the city\r\nevery night, the bag was sent round for aid to the strikers. At one\r\nlecture I counted seven bags--chiefly students’ caps--going round for\r\nvarious righteous causes. In one of the most moderate of all Liberal\r\npapers--the _Russian News_--a strike fund was organized for the\r\nwomen and children, and it reached about £5000 before the Government\r\nclutched it and put it in its own pocket. In all Progressive papers you\r\nread advertisements that Mr. or Mrs. So-and-So would undertake to feed\r\nso many strikers for so many days, or to house the children. I knew\r\nthree Socialist families of quite poor people who took in one or two\r\nchildren of strikers every day to share their dinner. The noticeable\r\nthing was that the children were fed, no matter what party of Socialism\r\ntheir parents belonged to. All the workers knew that the strike so far\r\nhad been the people’s only weapon. The Government had two--hunger and\r\nthe rifle.\r\n\r\nNearly every night meetings were held for the new unions which were\r\nspringing up on every side. The whole of Moscow, which is built in\r\nconcentric circles round the Kremlin or eminent citadel overhanging\r\nthe little river, had been divided off into wedges, or “rays,” as\r\nthey were called, and each ray sent so many delegates to the central\r\ncommittee--corresponding to the Council of Labour Delegates in St.\r\nPetersburg--which superintended the whole labour question, and had to\r\ndecide the moment for strikes. But besides the central organizations,\r\nalmost every trade was forming its own union of defence.\r\n\r\nFirst came the great Railway Union, which controlled the powerful\r\ninstrument of the railway strikes, and had its headquarters in Moscow,\r\nbecause the city is the obvious centre of all Russian railways. Perhaps\r\nnext in size, though hardly in importance, came the peculiar union of\r\nFloor Polishers--a class of workers unknown in England, because we\r\nare not clean enough to have parquetted floors. But in Moscow they\r\nwere said to number thirty thousand in the union. There were other\r\nlarge unions besides--the tailors’, the metal-workers’, the waiters’,\r\nthe jewellers’, and a very strong printers’ union called “The Society\r\nof the Printed Word,” said to be the oldest in Russia, and rising\r\nalmost to the dignity of a knightly order by its title. The Union of\r\nBathmen and Bathwomen, a very large class of labour in Russia, is also\r\nold, and in those weeks they came to the very satisfactory decision\r\nof declaring a boycott against the editor of Katkoff’s famous old\r\nclerical and reactionary paper, the _Moscow News_ (_Moskovskaya\r\nViedomosti_). No minister of the union would wash the editor of the\r\n_Moscow News_ at any price.\r\n\r\nOne evening I was present at the formation of two new unions in very\r\ndifferent classes of labour. First I went to an immense meeting of\r\ntea-packers in a summer theatre, attached to the Aumont, a music\r\nhall of easy virtue. But the theatre had now been boarded up into a\r\nmeeting-house as more suitable for the times. Packers of the Chinese\r\ntea that comes overland are naturally a large class in Moscow, for the\r\ntea is still the Russian national drink, in spite of the deadly blend\r\nfrom Ceylon which is slowly being introduced. The packers are said\r\nto number about six thousand, and forty companies sent deputies to\r\nthe meeting, though some of the companies employed only eight or ten\r\nhands. It is an unhealthy trade, the dust leading to consumption; and\r\nof all the many meetings I attended it was only here that I found the\r\nvoices feeble and toneless. Wages run from half a crown a week for boys\r\nand girls up £1 a week for the best men. But in the trade there is an\r\nancient peculiarity that the wife of the owner or manager has to supply\r\na free midday dinner for the hands, and, as one of the delegates said,\r\n“Apparently she cooks it in hell.”\r\n\r\nThe other new union was formed at a meeting of shop assistants,\r\nconducted with that suavity and grandeur of manner which one always\r\nnotices at meetings of this class. It comes from watching the grace of\r\nthe shopwalkers, who alone carry the dignified and charming traditions\r\nof the old noblesse into modern life. The meeting was occupied for\r\nmany hours in discussing whether the union should attend only to the\r\nassistants’ interests, or should enter into wider life as a political\r\nforce. The Social Democrats urged them to be bold, and, as usual,\r\nthey had their way. They were far the most strongly organized party;\r\nthey had their speakers ready at every meeting, and they played their\r\n“minimum programme” of quietly progressive measures with great effect.\r\nTheir opponents were unprepared, and on this occasion were almost too\r\npolite to argue. I came away soon after midnight, but it was obvious\r\nthat the Shop Assistants’ Union would be a Social Democratic force\r\nbefore dawn.\r\n\r\nMid-winter is the height of the season for learning, art, and pleasure,\r\nbut Moscow was neither gay nor learned. Reading and fiddling seemed\r\nequally irrelevant. So were painting, poetry, love-making, and all\r\nthe other pleasant arts. In the big restaurant of the Métropole, it\r\nis true, an orchestra still maintained a pretence of joy, and poured\r\nout its vapid tunes to the rare guests who sat like shipwrecked\r\nsailors scattered on a vasty deep, and struggled to be gay. But, like\r\na middle-aged picnic on the Thames, the thing was too deliberate a\r\nhappiness, and too conscious of its failure. “We must keep our spirits\r\nup, you know,” I heard a youth say to an elderly gentleman as he poured\r\nout the champagne. But it was no good. The elderly gentleman had\r\nobviously dined well daily for many years, and was overwhelmed at the\r\nsolemn thought that at any moment dinners might end for ever. Day and\r\nnight he was living in “the haggard element of fear.”\r\n\r\nThe University was closed. Her seven thousand students were scattered,\r\nsome to their homes, some to their lodgings in the city, where for\r\nthe most part they swelled the army of the Social Democrats, and\r\nspent their time discussing maximum and minimum programmes and the\r\nsocialization of productivity. They were also collecting arms.\r\n\r\n“It was impossible to keep open. The students would insist on turning\r\nthe quadrangle into a Fort Chabrol,” said Professor Manioukoff, the new\r\nRector of the University, a learned economist and advanced politician,\r\nwho, being prohibited from studying grievances nearer home, had won\r\nfame by specializing on the Irish land question. So the University was\r\nclosed, the professors were compelled to pursue research without the\r\ndue endowment of fees, and their wives and babies had to manage upon\r\nhalf the family income.\r\n\r\nMany of them took to lecturing, not for pay, but because it was the\r\nonly thing they could do for the Movement. One night I listened to\r\none who lectured for nearly two hours on the comparative history of\r\namnesties during the last few centuries, with a very close application\r\nto the present time. He still called himself a Professor, though he had\r\nbeen exiled from his Chair for so many years that his name had long\r\nbeen forgotten, and, like most of the exiles, he came back to a world\r\nwhich regarded him with a considerate but uneasy pity, as we should all\r\nregard the dead if they returned. For nearly thirty years he had lived\r\nin Bulgaria, surely not too far away to be remembered, and now he was\r\nlecturing again in Moscow, an old man, lame and blind, dressed in a\r\nfrock-coat and worsted slippers. His nice little granddaughter guided\r\nhis steps, kept his water-glass full, reminded him every half-hour\r\nof the flight of time (which he bore patiently), and put him right\r\nabout his dates, which made the audience smile. Otherwise, the large\r\nlecture hall, packed with the intellectual, listened intently, but\r\nshowed no sign of approval until the end. The portrait of the Tsar had\r\nbeen carefully removed from behind the chair, and only the gaunt iron\r\nstaples showed where it had hung.\r\n\r\nAnother evening, in one of those dubious theatres which had just\r\nbeen converted to decent use, I heard a Professor deliver an immense\r\ndiscourse upon the first principles of Social Democracy before an\r\naudience half composed of working people. They also listened patiently,\r\nbut the moment of real excitement came when the lecturer ceased, and\r\nthree young soldiers sprang upon the stage and shouted that, on the\r\nhighest economic principles, they too had struck, and would Cossack\r\nit no more. “I have flung away the uniform!” shouted one, who was\r\napparelled in a long dressing-gown. “No more fools of officers over\r\nme!” shouted another. “And they fed us like swine!” shouted the third,\r\nwho was just economically drunk. The applause that rocked the audience\r\nwas one of the grandest noises I have ever heard. If only all the army\r\nwould follow the example of those three gallant musketeers! But that\r\nnight they vanished from the blaze of glory, and I heard of them no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nVanished too were the Zemstvoists, the men who, in July, had impeached\r\nthe Government in an overwhelming series of accusations. Since the\r\ndeath of their hero, Prince Sergius Troubetskoy, their heart had failed\r\nthem, and in November, when they met again in congress and their chance\r\nhad come, they wasted the precious days in discussions upon Witte’s\r\ncharacter, just like a suburban essay society discussing Hamlet. But\r\ntime was going fast just then, and before they had settled Witte’s\r\npsychology to their satisfaction they were forgotten. They had meant\r\nso well by their counsels of moderation and attempts to imitate the\r\nBritish Constitution, but rushing time had left them lonely. Yet\r\nMoscow was rather strong in Liberal papers, which the bourgeoisie were\r\nglad to accept as protests against the extremes of socialism. The\r\n_Russian News_, for instance, edited by white-haired Sobolevski,\r\nwith a grey-haired staff, was a strictly moderate paper, as I have\r\nsaid, though its writers had become so inspired by the youthfulness\r\nof the time that their articles would have sent them a year before to\r\nmeditate in prison or exile upon the license of governments.\r\n\r\nThen again, the first Sunday I was in Moscow, Professor Miliukoff\r\nbrought out his new paper called _Life_ (_Zhisn_) on simple\r\nand moderate lines. He began with a long and earnest appeal for the\r\nunity of Progressive parties against the common enemy of Absolutism.\r\n“Let us all combine,” he cried, “into a bloc, and present a solid front\r\nto the ancient tyranny and new reaction. When Absolutism is overthrown,\r\nthere will be time enough to discuss the divergent lines of our own\r\nprogrammes.” Every one respected Professor Miliukoff, and was cheered\r\nby his eternal hopefulness. The advice was obviously sensible. Its\r\nonly fault was that it was sensible to commonplace--just too obviously\r\nsensible for times of high exhilaration, when the position of the\r\nmoderate man is always painful and usually neglected. Neither workmen\r\nnor Social Democrats cared in the least for a Liberal alliance. They\r\nknew that, in any case, the Liberals would join them in the fight\r\nagainst Absolutism, and to the truly revolutionary spirit Liberalism is\r\nalways suspect. A significant cartoon came out that week, called “The\r\nHare at the Hunt.” The lion of the proletariat has sprung upon the Bear\r\nof tyranny; but in the foreground the Hare of the bourgeoisie is seen\r\nhastening up and delicately nibbling at one of the dead Bear’s ears, as\r\nmuch as to say, “Please, give me a little bit too!” A little bit might\r\nbe given to the Moderates, but the proletariat were determined to keep\r\nthe lion’s share.\r\n\r\nOne day, for the sake of comparison with the proletariat of St.\r\nPetersburg, I went over a large and very rich factory, which almost\r\nholds a monopoly in candles, and the darkness of Northern Russia for\r\nsix months in the year makes a candle monopoly valuable. At the end of\r\nOctober a serious riot had occurred there, and the front of the mill\r\nwas still a wreck of bricks and broken glass. The strikers had then\r\ndemanded a 50 per cent. rise in wages, an eight-hour day, a lodging\r\nallowance of 6_s._ to 10_s._ a month, pensions of half wages\r\nafter fifteen years’ work, and pensions of full wages after twenty-five\r\nyears. When I was there, they had just begun work again on a rise of 16\r\nper cent., an eight-hour day in three shifts, and a lodging allowance\r\nof 4_s._ 6_d._ a month. That lodging allowance arises from\r\nthe general old custom of living-in. Hitherto all the single men and\r\nsingle women had lived in barrack dormitories inside the mill, with\r\na room for meals, gas, heating, and washing-troughs provided. These\r\nblocks of lodgings--“spalnya,” as they are called--dismal and crowded\r\nas life in them must be, were perhaps as comfortable and much cheaper\r\nthan the accommodation to be had outside. But they lacked the one\r\ngreat charm in life--the charm of liberty. At the time of the strike,\r\nthe hands demanded the right of receiving friends and relations from\r\noutside into the premises. The managers complied, and that evening\r\nthe whole place was crammed with enthusiastic advocates of family\r\naffection. A mass meeting, eloquent of revolution, was held in the\r\nmill yard, and the devotees of friendship paraded their red flags in\r\nfront of the managers’ quarters with trumpet and drum. Next day the\r\nmanagers withdrew their amiable concession, cleared the dormitories\r\nof men and women, and turned them neck and crop out into the road to\r\nfend for themselves. The lodging allowance was given to prevent further\r\nriots and to soothe the conscience. In the matter of money, it is no\r\ncompensation for what the workmen lose, but liberty is thrown in, and\r\nliberty counts so high that I think the workers had the best of it in\r\nthe end, and probably the old barracks will gradually disappear.\r\n\r\nIn the last twenty years the rate of pay has gone up fourfold, while\r\nthe cost of living has only doubled. A good workman in this mill now\r\nreceived from 24_s._ to 30_s._ a week, which appeared to\r\nbe the maximum wage, and since the strike a woman’s wage had risen\r\nto 8_s._ a week, with the same lodging allowance as the men, or\r\nabout 9_s._ 2_d._ a week in all. The standard of food was\r\nperhaps a little higher than in St. Petersburg, for, except during\r\nfasts, the family expected some sort of meat or stew every day. But\r\nthis was a particularly rich mill; it prided itself on its high wages,\r\nand the Englishmen of its management delighted to display a paternal\r\nbenevolence to the innocent unfortunates of a lower race. It was\r\ncertainly remarkable that all the hands had gone back, except those who\r\ncould not be summoned from their villages owing to the breakdown of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nOf course, the prolonged post strike, which had continued for nearly\r\nthree weeks then, was inconvenient for everybody. Revolutions are\r\ngenerally inconvenient, especially for business people. But it was\r\nrather too much when that ancient champion of tyranny, the _Novoe\r\nVremya_, took this opportunity for working itself up into such a\r\nglow of righteous indignation because the strikers were depriving\r\nmankind of humanity’s glorious right--the right of communication and\r\nspeech--the right of corresponding with fellow-men afar off, and\r\ncalling on others to associate in their joys and griefs. What had the\r\n_Novoe Vremya_ cared about that glorious right a few months\r\nbefore? What protest had it ever raised against a censorship that pried\r\ninto letters, and chuckled over lovers’ secrets, and tracked men down\r\nto death through the words of their friends? Or what communication with\r\ntheir fellow-men had been allowed to exiles and prisoners--exiles and\r\nprisoners who had been wiped out from human existence for exercising\r\nthat glorious right of speech? In reading leading articles like that I\r\nhave sometimes detected limits beyond which even hypocrisy ceases to be\r\ndecent.\r\n\r\nBut in times of revolution we must expect and tolerate much wild\r\nabsurdity among people who are afraid of losing their money, and among\r\nthe startled cowards who have suddenly realized what revolution is. In\r\na letter to his own paper, the _New Life_, about this time, Maxim\r\nGorky said that people had been writing to him from all over Russia to\r\nask why it was that the patient workman and the dear, gentle peasant,\r\nwhom the advanced thinkers used to worship as a saint, had suddenly\r\nshown themselves so very disagreeable and dangerous. There was a\r\ncrudity and innocence about the question which takes us back more than\r\nhalf a century in Western social history, and Gorky’s own answer sounds\r\nto us almost as much a truism as a chapter of Charles Kingsley seems\r\nnow. He merely repeated the weary old truth that in ordinary times the\r\nrich and governing classes have never taken the smallest notice of the\r\nworker and the peasant. When have they ever turned from their games of\r\nambition or pleasure to consider the poor? In what way have they shared\r\ntheir life, except in the distribution of doles, which are given for\r\ntheir own comfort? If a bad time had now come for them, and if a worse\r\nwas coming, that was only the natural turning of a wheel which had been\r\nslow to turn.\r\n\r\nIn our country we have long been familiar with such statements. We have\r\nlong known that the rich man’s charity is but a ransom for himself, so\r\nthat he may follow enjoyment with undisturbed content. We have long\r\nknown that the sympathies of comfortable people are limited by their\r\nown comfort. We have also learnt how vain it is to preach such truths,\r\nif preaching is to end in words. But what to us has become true to\r\nsatiety may still be a bewildering paradox to less experienced and less\r\nsophisticated nations, and the extraordinary influence of writers like\r\nGorky in Russia seems to arise from the simple-hearted earnestness\r\nwith which thoughtful Russians have received their doctrine. What to\r\nus appears so painfully true that we had almost forgotten it, may dawn\r\nupon them as a fine paradox of revelation.\r\n\r\nThe teaching in Gorky’s new play, _The Children of the Sun_ would\r\nbe rather less familiar to us, for it strikes at the intellectual\r\nclasses, who generally regard themselves as above criticism, whereas\r\nthe rich have become case-hardened to sermons and abuse. It was then\r\nbeing performed in his own theatre--the best theatre in the world,\r\nairy, admirably planned for hearing, entirely free from the curse of\r\ndecoration, and provided with a large hall where the audience could\r\ndiscuss revolution during the welcome pauses which extend Russian\r\nentertainments through the night. The drama is Ibsenite--a humorous\r\ntragedy, with plenty of ironic laughter, though it fades away into a\r\npaltry German suicide. But the political point is that the central\r\nfigure--an excellent man of science, simple, sweet tempered, and\r\ndevoted with all his heart to the creation of life by chemical\r\nmeans--declares that intellectual people like himself are in reality\r\ntoiling for the poor, no matter how indifferent they may appear to the\r\npoverty of others. They are the children of the sun--the almost divine\r\nbeings who shed light in the darkness of the world. The simple-hearted\r\nchemist is himself a true saint of intellect. When, with the consent\r\nof his wife, a rich and lovely lady flings herself round his neck and\r\noffers him all her love and a complete laboratory, he accepts the\r\nlaboratory with rapture, but asks if the love is not superfluous.\r\nNevertheless all his innocence, his devotion, and his real kindliness\r\nof heart do not help him in the least when the peasants, infuriated for\r\nliberty, come storming down the village and almost choke the life out\r\nof that Child of the Sun in his own back garden.\r\n\r\nThat was likely to be the fate of many excellent people, who were\r\npursuing culture without extravagance. Many who deserved no worse than\r\nthe rest of us poor intellectual and decently clothed men were caught\r\nup in the whirling skirts of revolution and carried shrieking they knew\r\nnot where. From every side came rumours of burnings and slaughters.\r\nThe country was spoken of as a wilderness of destruction, into which\r\nnone dared penetrate. For many days in vain I sought for a guide and\r\ninterpreter to accompany me among the peasants. To enter a village was\r\nsudden death, and not for three pounds a day would a townsman go with\r\nme, till at last I found one whose poverty consented.\r\n\r\nIn Moscow itself we were still revelling in liberty. We lived under an\r\nanarchy almost fit for the angels, who by their divine nature are a law\r\nunto themselves. But, unhappily, as I said, our liberty was tempered\r\nby assassination. For some weeks the average of street murders was one\r\na day. Barefooted, long-haired beggars, the very heroes of Gorky’s\r\ntales, the ragged supermen of misery, sprang out from dark corners, and\r\nI always thanked them heartily for their mistake in regarding my money\r\nas more valuable than my life. People walked warily, and kept one eye\r\nbehind them, turning sharply round if they heard even the padding sound\r\nof goloshes in the snow. Often at night, as I went up and down the\r\nrampart of the Kremlin, and watched those ancient white temples with\r\ntheir brazen domes glittering under the moon, I noticed that the few\r\npassers-by skirted round me in a kind of arc, and if they came upon me\r\nsuddenly they ran. My intentions were far from murderous, but all were\r\nliving in that haggard element of fear. They had not yet realized that\r\nthe only decent way to live is to take life in one hand and possessions\r\nin the other, and both hands open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                             THE OLD ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Nicholas’ Day of December 19th had long been awaited with\r\nexpectation, both of triumph and fear. It was the Tsar’s christening\r\nday--one of the four festivals which were given to St. Nicholas every\r\nyear, because, on his way to see Christ, he stopped to help a peasant’s\r\ncart out of the mud and made his clothes all dirty. It had been\r\nrumoured with confidence that the work of the great Manifesto would\r\nthen be completed--that the Tsar himself would come to Moscow, and from\r\nthe very shrine of the Empire issue the charter of a free Constitution,\r\nand, like a generous father, distribute the Crown lands among the\r\npeasants. It was a splendid opportunity for heroic concession--such\r\nconcession as would have gathered nearly the whole mass of the people\r\nround its author in enthusiastic devotion. But there was nothing\r\nheroic about the poor little Tsar--“Homunculus,” as the satirists\r\ncalled him--and the mood of concession had passed away. It was a time\r\nfor reaction now, the imprisonment of labour leaders, the arrest of\r\neditors, the closure of meetings, the incitement to murder.\r\n\r\nFor a week past the day had been looked forward to with terror by most\r\nProgressives, and especially by the Jews. Christians had been preparing\r\nfor themselves large crosses of wood, iron, or even cardboard, which\r\nthey hung round their necks, so that when the religious mob attacked\r\nthem, they might fling open their furs and reveal their Christianity\r\nvisible upon their waistcoats.\r\n\r\nBut the children of darkness were a-tiptoe for the slaughter. Only\r\nthe day before the festival, the patriotic organization of the Black\r\nHundred, called the Hooligans or the Order of the Men of Russia\r\naccording to sympathy, had issued a manifesto inciting to the final\r\nextermination of all Jews and foreigners in the city. Their common duty\r\nto God and the Tsar commanded all true men to unite in clearing Holy\r\nRussia of the accursed stranger. At the same time, the more moderate of\r\nthe priesthood, mindful of an accepted distinction between religion and\r\nmurder, wrote a letter to the papers, appealing to the faithful to act\r\nlike Christians and not to kill the Jews. But such advice was a mere\r\nbewilderment to the simple man. To kill Jews is to act like Christians.\r\nWhy complicate matters by raising the doubt? Ages of history had proved\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo the Jews and many of the foreigners fortified their houses and hid\r\nthemselves. All Moscow, indeed, was fortified in a manner, for new\r\nshutters and hoardings now protected doors and windows of all shops and\r\nmany houses which were left open before. In the evening I went through\r\nthe streets, and all was gloom and silence and fear. In one place on\r\nthe Boulevard a slightly drunken soldier, who had been boasting of\r\nhis revolutionary convictions, was surrounded by a little knot of\r\nloyalists, beguiled down a side court, and quietly slaughtered. At the\r\ndoor of a little restaurant in my own street I found a shouting mob.\r\nThey had set upon a student and beaten him senseless. The restaurant\r\npeople had dragged his body, almost naked, into the house and laid it\r\nacross two chairs in a cellar. Through holes in the shutter you could\r\nsee it lying there, in a shirt that oozed blood, while a girl student,\r\nwho had been with him, knelt with her arms round his neck and cried\r\naloud. At the sound of her crying, the mob yelled with exultation, and\r\nfought for a place at the shutter.\r\n\r\nMorning came, intensely cold, but clear and bright. Before nine o’clock\r\nlarge crowds had begun to gather on the Kremlin--that triangular\r\ncitadel of old cathedrals and palaces in the centre of Moscow,\r\nsurrounded by an ancient crenellated wall, looking steeply down over\r\nthe river on the south side. The priesthood had asked leave for a\r\nspecial ceremony of prayer on account of Russia’s troubles, and the\r\nnew Governor-General, Admiral Dubásoff, who had arrived only two days\r\nbefore, could not decently refuse a prayer meeting to the patriotic\r\nministers of peace, especially at a time when the Government was only\r\nlonging for disturbances as an excuse for military assassination.\r\n\r\nThe prayer meeting was fixed for the great open space called the Red or\r\nSplendid Square (Krasnaya) lying between the Kremlin proper and the Old\r\nTown, which is surrounded by a similar wall. But the church services\r\nfor the saint’s day had first to be held in the cathedrals, and by ten\r\no’clock the sacred banners from all the great shrines of Moscow began\r\nto assemble on the height where the three cathedrals, the bell tower,\r\nand the great palace stand. A sacred banner is a metal plate, generally\r\nabout three feet square, hanging out sideways from a pool like a flag,\r\nexcept that it is quite stiff. The people like to think of it as gold,\r\nbut that would not prevent it being brass. The plate itself is fretted\r\nin various designs, and at the centre is an icon, a representation\r\nof some saint or religious scene--St. George with his dragon, the\r\nResurrection, or the Ascension--sometimes painted on board, sometimes\r\nworked in silver and other metals. The banner is further adorned with\r\nrich enamels, and rattles a fringe of metal tassels. I counted nearly\r\na hundred of them glittering in the frosty sun, as they entered the\r\nKremlin gates in groups and passed the piled-up lines of guns which\r\nNapoleon left behind him, and the new white palings round the little\r\nshrine where the Grand Duke Sergius met his end.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to estimate the number of people who swarmed on\r\nevery open space and crowded the steps of all the churches. There\r\nwere many thousands, and all were bowing and crossing themselves or\r\nkneeling in the snow with adoration before every shrine and at every\r\nsaint that passed. All classes were there, and sometimes a lady, deep\r\nin furs, would signal to her servant to put down a cushion or piece of\r\nmackintosh on the particular spot where she wished to worship. But, as\r\nis natural in a religious ceremony, on the whole it was a crowd of the\r\npoor. Many peasants had come in from the country, conspicuous for their\r\nwild hair and leather coats. But the greater part were simply the poor\r\nof Moscow--the pious, the patriotic, the criminal poor--all who are\r\nthe natural enemies of change. They went from shrine to shrine, they\r\ncrowded round the Great Bell, they climbed the brass-domed tower for\r\nthe view, they filled the cathedrals till it was impossible to stir\r\ninside, and from the outside we could only listen to the deep chantings\r\nthat boomed through the open doors. And all the time the crossings and\r\nbowings and prostrations in the snow never ceased.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General and other great officials and soldiers had a\r\nspecially short service, in accordance with their dignity, in some\r\nchapel up the Lion staircase, where no unhallowed or ununiformed foot\r\nis fit to tread. But by eleven all the services were over, and with\r\ninfinite effort the holy banners were drawn up in two lines beside the\r\nGreat Bell. Their main poles being supported by four smaller poles,\r\nthey began to move slowly and with difficulty towards the gate into\r\nthe Red Square. It is the Holy Gate of the Saviour, under which every\r\nRussian takes off his cap, so sacred for centuries has been the picture\r\nabove the arch.\r\n\r\nSmall bodies of Cossacks, and of infantry with fixed bayonets, were\r\nstationed along the route or accompanied the procession, to protect\r\nthe heavenly powers. When at last the glittering banners had staggered\r\nby, there came a group of priests in robes stiff with gold and\r\nmany-coloured embroideries, thrown over their ordinary fur coats, and\r\nhelping to make them warm as well as beautiful. And behind them came a\r\nparty of earthly saints in apparel still more marvellous. I think they\r\nwere bishops, but they may have been archimandrites. They wore hats of\r\nbrass or gold, shaped like Byzantine domes, and sprinkled with gleaming\r\nglass or precious stones. Some of the saints had hair hanging far down\r\ntheir chests and backs; others were less devout in shagginess.\r\n\r\nLast of all, supported by an extra strong detachment of Cossacks, came\r\nthe banners of the most sacred shrine in Moscow, accompanying the\r\npicture of the Iberian Virgin herself, which had been brought out for\r\nthe occasion in its wooden case from its own rich chapel at the Iberian\r\ngate. As she passed--this famous virgin, copied from the Virgin of\r\nMount Athos centuries ago--the crowds on each side bowed before her\r\nlike corn when the wind blows.\r\n\r\nSo the procession moved under the Gate of the Saviour, and gathered\r\non the round stone platform where Ivan the Cruel used to enjoy the\r\nexecutions. It stands in front of Ivan’s many-coloured church, built\r\nby the Italian whose eyes (as the old myth says) were put out that he\r\nmight never design another so gay. The service of special prayer was\r\nthere performed, and as the clocks struck twelve and the guns began\r\nto fire a salute, the religious part of the day came to an end. The\r\nbanners went back into the Kremlin; the Iberian Virgin was carried in a\r\nfour-wheeler to her shrine; the bishops and archimandrites drove away\r\nto lunch in huge coaches drawn by four black horses abreast.\r\n\r\nThen the moment came which all had awaited--the moment for which the\r\nprayers to God had only been the excuse. Now or never was the time for\r\nslaughter and enrichment. A fervid orator sprang on the balustrade\r\nof the stone platform, and with athletic gesticulations and rousing\r\nappeals to heaven and the Tsar, strove to lash the crowd to the\r\nproposed heat of fury. Other patriots were busy extolling the beauty\r\nof domestic virtue, and distributing photographs of the Tsar with his\r\nbaby-boy upon his knee. The people cheered and shouted, and began to\r\nrush up and down, like caged wolves just before feeding-time. Then\r\nraising the Russian hymn, the orator, still threatening the bright\r\ninfinity of space with his fists, set off to march up the whole\r\nlength of the square. The crowd swarmed after him, thousands strong.\r\nThey trickled through the two little arches of the Iberian gate, and\r\ngathering together again, swept in one great tide up the main street\r\ncalled the Tverskaya.\r\n\r\nThey were going to slaughter the Jews, and exterminate the students,\r\nand purify the city. No end to the horrors they were going to perform.\r\nBut they reached the square in front of the Government House, and\r\nthere they stopped to make speeches, calling again upon heaven and\r\nthe Tsar, and urging the Governor-General to take vengeance upon all\r\nrevolutionaries and other enemies of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General appeared in uniform upon the balcony--tall and\r\npale, white haired, with long white moustache, and a narrow, pointed\r\nbeard. It was Admiral Dubásoff, hitherto only known as Russia’s\r\nrepresentative in the inquiry about the Baltic Fleet’s victory off\r\nHull; afterwards to be better known as the Butcher or the Admiral of\r\nthe Street. In a loud voice he addressed the crowd, telling them how\r\ndelighted he was to see so many Russian citizens still on the Tsar’s\r\nside, and promising to telegraph to the Tsar with what confidence his\r\nMajesty could rely upon the unshaken loyalty and unflinching courage of\r\nancient Moscow.\r\n\r\nIt was a little unfortunate that just at that moment, before the cheers\r\ncould even begin, some one at the corner of the square near me raised\r\nthe cry, “The students are coming! The students! The students!” Like a\r\nwind, terror swept over the crowd, the sledges dashed away in flight,\r\nand, plunging, falling, and crashing into each other, the people rushed\r\ndown any street and hid round any corner for their lives. I have seen\r\nmany fine panics, from the Greek war downwards, but never anything\r\nquite so ludicrous as that stampede of bloody-minded patriots. For\r\nnothing whatever had happened, and when at last the terrified loyalists\r\ntook heart to look behind them, they saw the square peaceful, silent,\r\nand almost empty. One by one they crept back into courage. They even\r\ntried to rekindle their patriotic zeal and resume their murderous\r\naspect. But it was no good. The Governor-General had gone indoors to\r\ndispatch his telegram in praise of their courage. That unhappy run had\r\nspoilt the whole massacre, and gradually the orators ceased to rage,\r\nand every one went home for dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                         THE DAYS OF MOSCOW--I\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day (December 20th), I had determined to start for the Caucasus,\r\nbecause very severe fighting was reported there, and it was said,\r\nI believe truly, that in some places the Georgians had set up an\r\nindependent government of their own. Accordingly I sledged to the\r\nstation, took my ticket, and registered my luggage to Baku by\r\nRostoff-on-Don, occupied my place in the heated train, hung up my fur\r\ncoat and snow boots, and prepared to endure the full blast of a Russian\r\ncarriage for the four days and nights of the journey. As is the way in\r\nRussia, the train filled up nearly an hour before it was time to start,\r\nand we all sat contemplating each other and wondering what our manners\r\nwould be like on the way. There were a large number of peasants and\r\ncountry people in the train, packed together into family sections with\r\ntheir children, and baskets, and bedding. Next to me sat a cleanly old\r\nman and his wife, who held their goods upon their knees with a sturdy\r\nresignation, as much as to say, “Now let Heaven do its worst.”\r\n\r\nSo we waited, and taking out a book I was far away in the city of the\r\n“Lys Rouge” upon the Arno, when I became dimly conscious of a feeling\r\nof uneasiness in the carriages, as when a motor breaks down and the\r\nCity men fret. Doors were opened and heads put out, and footsteps\r\npassed up and down the corridor. Distant shouting and questions\r\nwere heard. The man opposite me packed up his lunch and went out. I\r\nfollowed, and saw a party of railway men just uncoupling the engine,\r\nwhich puffed away for twenty yards and then stood still. With a long\r\ndiminishing hiss, the steam of the heating apparatus rushed out from\r\nthe pipes and left the train to grow cold, like the dead.\r\n\r\n“Strike?” I said, going up to the workmen. “Yes, general strike at\r\ntwelve o’clock,” they answered, and I gathered up my book and coat.\r\nThe rest of my luggage could not be recovered then, and next night it\r\nwent wandering down the line upon the train, and was no more seen. For\r\nChristmas was coming, and many trains that were wandering upon the road\r\nsupplied seasonable gifts for the peasants’ needs. Hundreds of nice\r\ngeese and ducks they gave them, loads of vegetables, barrels of sugar.\r\nFor miles beyond the city, the railway was like an enormous Christmas\r\nhamper, full of good cheer, and many a starving peasant recognized for\r\nthe first time the true significance of the holy festival.\r\n\r\nAs to the cleanly old man and woman, they sat there still, clutching\r\ntheir goods. It seemed that nothing short of the Last Trumpet could\r\ninduce them to stir. They had taken their tickets, and their confidence\r\nin railways was unshaken. They looked at me with the sympathetic\r\ntolerance we show to a crank who questions gravitation or maintains\r\nthe earth is flat. The peasants in like manner sat still and cherished\r\ntheir young. It seemed incredible they should not go after they had\r\ntaken all that trouble to get started for home, and had settled down\r\ninto their lairs in the nice warm train. I left them still seated\r\nthere, amid expostulations growing shrill. But in the next fortnight I\r\nhad to return many times to the station, and day after day I found them\r\nencamped in the waiting-rooms, one family living on a table by day and\r\nunder it at night, another resolutely holding a leather bench, and two\r\nor three nested behind the bar. To keep them alive, the railway issued\r\na dole of about a shilling a day for the grown-ups, and they cooked\r\ntheir tea and bits of food at the stoves or inside the locomotives.\r\nBut it was not a happy way of spending life. Children sprawled and\r\nfought and wailed; mothers tried in vain to wash and clean; men tripped\r\nover girls asleep upon the boards. And it was worse when, a few days\r\nlater, scores of soldiers dribbled in somehow from the war, unwashed,\r\nbewildered, and wretched, and were thrown into the station among the\r\npeasants, to live there as best they could. The smell of men’s tents\r\nin the morning in war time is not pleasant, but it is Arabia compared\r\nto those waiting-rooms.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back that Wednesday from the station to the middle of the\r\ncity, I found the general strike already proclaimed. All the banks were\r\nshut and barricaded. If any shops were still open, parties of strikers\r\nor revolutionists went into them and compelled the owners to put the\r\nshutters up. The schools were closed, the work-people walked out of the\r\nmills, clerks left their offices, and several hundred thousand men and\r\nwomen were turned loose into the streets with nothing to do. Such gas\r\nas was in the retorts was allowed to burn itself out, but electricity\r\nwas cut off at once, both for light and for the trams, and so was the\r\nwater for a time. People began to store it in baths and pails; they\r\neven searched the roofs for clean snow and melted it down; but next\r\nday the water supply was restored on the ground that it was essential\r\nfor the existence of the poor. Bread was essential too, and a few\r\nbakeries were allowed to keep working; but even that afternoon women\r\nwere standing in line outside the bakers’ shops, and in the following\r\ndays they began to gather there long before dawn. In the hotels, and\r\nI suppose in most well-to-do homes, bread sank from white to grey,\r\nvegetables disappeared, the price of meat doubled, unknown portions of\r\nanimals were seen, beer ceased to flow, and the suffering rich almost\r\nlearnt how the poor die daily.\r\n\r\nI went up the Tverskaya, already mentioned as the chief radius of\r\nMoscow for shops and cafés. It was full of wandering and uncertain\r\ncrowds. Where the circle of Boulevards crosses it by the Strastnoi\r\nconvent, I found a troop of horse drawn up in front of the poet\r\nPushkin’s statue. They were facing a thick and excited crowd, from the\r\nmidst of which a white-faced orator came forward and, standing at the\r\nvery nose of the officer’s charger, addressed him with impassioned\r\nharangues, imploring him to abandon the cause of tyranny, and no\r\nlonger to trample over the corpses of his fellow-countrymen. The\r\nofficer listened with genial politeness, and sometimes even answered an\r\nargument or raised some objection with a smile. His pleasing manners\r\nencouraged hope. The women of the crowd began to say nice things to\r\nhim, and all through Russian life there is a familiarity among the\r\nclasses which we have never reached. A friendly sympathy pervaded the\r\nair. Could it be possible that the troops would “fraternize”? Ah, how\r\noften revolutionists in all countries had told me the troops would\r\nfraternize!\r\n\r\nBut the officer gave an order, and the detachment wheeled off, two\r\ndeep, down the Boulevard to their barracks, the crowd clapping their\r\nhands, the women waving their scarves and blowing kisses to them in\r\ncheerful mockery as they went. Two were left behind, waiting for a\r\nthird whose horse they held, and on them the orator now turned his\r\neloquence, while the rest laughed and cheered, and tried to pat their\r\nhorses. But they were only two common peasants with broad, red faces,\r\nand had no pretty answers to make.\r\n\r\nThey only sat there looking straight before them while the taunts grew\r\nlouder and the people began to crush threateningly upon them. I was\r\nclose at their side and could see their fists doubled tightly round the\r\nloaded whips on their saddles. But at that moment their comrade came\r\nback, and all three galloped after the others amid a storm of derision\r\nand angry cries.\r\n\r\nHardly had they gone when from a tea-house opposite three red flags on\r\npoles emerged and were marched into the square. Uncertain what to do\r\nnext, the boys who were carrying them started down the Tverskaya, and\r\nthe crowd followed in a dense mass, shouting the “Marseillaise.” They\r\nreached the open space in front of the Governor-General’s house where\r\nthe loyalists had held their panic the day before. But hardly had they\r\npassed the porch, when a squadron of Cossacks swept into the crowd\r\nbehind from a side street at right angles and pursued the red flags at\r\nfull gallop, whirling their nagaikas and riding down all before them.\r\nThe procession scattered like leaves. The squadron divided, part\r\ncharging down the main street, and part across the square. In a few\r\nseconds nothing remained upon that open space but some men and girls\r\nstretched upon the snow, and the three long strips of red cotton which\r\nlay as the emblems of freedom before the Governor-General’s door. The\r\npolice carried off the wounded to the cells; an infantry battalion was\r\nbrought out to line the square, and many days were to pass before I\r\ncould cross it again.\r\n\r\nThat night, all the main streets stood in absolute darkness, only the\r\nnarrow side-streets being lit with a glimmer of gas. No sledges ran.\r\nHere and there a beggar shuffled out upon me from his lurking-place, or\r\na figure visible for a moment disappeared silently. No women walked;\r\non them too the strike had fallen. Houses and churches stood black and\r\nlifeless, like an abandoned city which time had not yet ruined.\r\n\r\nThe next day was ominously quiet; no business was done; no newspapers\r\nwere published; people kept indoors; even the restaurants and provision\r\nshops were shut, and in the Hotel Métropole the music ceased. Instead\r\nof that melancholy orchestra, a battery of eight guns lay hidden there\r\nnow; the guests were turned out, and it was said the Governor-General\r\nhimself had made the hotel his headquarters. Others had seen him take\r\nrefuge in the sacred enclosure of the Kremlin, where the ancient gates\r\nwere all shut and guarded. Even in the Old Town they brought planks\r\nand beams, and nailed up nearly all the gates. Troops were posted at\r\nthe Nicolai or St. Petersburg station and the line kept open for the\r\narrival of reinforcements. The engines were worked by soldiers and\r\nthe whole length of the road watched by pickets who were provisioned\r\nfrom the trains. The Government dared not trust the ordinary Moscow\r\ngarrison, but if outside troops could only be spared from the other\r\ncapital, all might be well.\r\n\r\nA large meeting of the strikers assembled at the Aumont or Aquarium and\r\ncalled upon the revolutionary bands or “militia” (_drouzchina_) to\r\nbegin. They pointed to the shameless reaction of the past two weeks, to\r\nthe imprisonment of the labour leaders in St. Petersburg, the arrest of\r\nall Progressive editors, the refusal of the Tsar to make the expected\r\nconcessions on his name-day. He had made no concessions, he had only\r\nsought to buy the loyalty of the troops by promises of better food.\r\nIt was evident that the Government was forcing civil war upon the\r\npeople, and unless the revolutionists would act at once, the workmen\r\nwould throw up the game, go back to their work, and abandon all hope of\r\nchange for ever.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionists hesitated. They were not ready--they would not be\r\nready till February--not really ready till April. They were ill-armed,\r\nhad only eighty rifles as yet; a good many revolvers certainly, but\r\nnot enough bombs. Besides, if the Government wanted a rising, they\r\nobviously ought not to rise. It is a bad strategist who lets the\r\nenemy dictate the time for battle. The strike had been proclaimed in\r\nSt. Petersburg, certainly, but the leaders were all in prison, and\r\nalready it was seen to be a very half-hearted affair. Both the strike\r\nand revolutionary action should be simultaneous in all the large\r\ncities, if the great end was to be won. Christmas was near, and all\r\nthe work-people liked to save up a little money for the festival.\r\nEvery one bought a bottle of vodka, if nothing else. The peasants\r\nwould be turned against the revolution if the railway remained blocked\r\nover Christmastide, and they could not sell their produce. Already\r\nthreats had come in from the country, prophesying horrible deaths for\r\nthe railway men unless the strike ended at once. There was just time\r\nto appease the peasants now, for the Russian Christmas Day was still\r\nsixteen days ahead. So they hesitated, appealing for delay and a better\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nBut the Government had determined that neither delay nor opportunity\r\nshould be given. Their one thought was the urgent need of money.\r\nThe power that commands force is the Government, and the power that\r\ncommands money can command force; that was their just and simple\r\nargument. Their one hope was to stir up an ill-prepared rebellion,\r\nto crush it down, and stand triumphant before the nations of Europe,\r\nconfidently inviting new loans in the name of law and order, so as to\r\npay the interest on the old and “maintain the value of the rouble.”\r\nFor this object it was essential that people should be killed in large\r\nnumbers. The death of every Progressive went to establish the credit\r\nof the Treasury, and unless the slaughter came quickly, the officials\r\ncould not count upon their pay. The only alternative was national\r\nbankruptcy in the face of the world, and no more hope of pleasant loans\r\nagain. So troops and police were stationed round the Aquarium meeting\r\nand met the crowd as it came out with showers of blows from clubs and\r\nwhips. At all costs the people must be goaded into violence, or the\r\nGovernment’s strategy would have failed.\r\n\r\nThe final stroke was given the next day (Friday, December 22nd) and\r\nit proved entirely successful. It was evening, and a body of some\r\ntwo hundred of the revolutionary bands, including several women, was\r\ngathered in a flat belonging to a leader named Fiedler, I think a\r\nlawyer. He lived in the top floor of a tall white house, just opposite\r\nthe British Consulate, and not far from the post office.\r\n\r\nThe place had long been watched by spies. About ten o’clock, as the\r\nbands were debating war and peace, a knock came at the door and a\r\nsummons to surrender. They looked out of the window, and the street\r\nbelow was full of dark forms with gleams of steel. So it had begun in\r\nearnest at last! “And there shall be no drawing back,” thought one of\r\ntheir number, and seizing up a small bomb from the table, he threw it\r\nwith all his might among the dark figures below. It burst with a flash\r\nthat revealed the waiting troops, and an officer rolled in the dirt,\r\nnever to be loved by women again. Two men also were wounded. Some said\r\ntwo officers were killed; some said twenty, and hundreds of men. But\r\nto have been in a town where men are really killed sheds a reflected\r\nglory, and the more numerous the dead, the finer the reputation of\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nThe flash of that bomb was a signal for war. The enemy was ready. They\r\nhad made their preparations for the event, and answered bomb by bomb.\r\nWhile the meeting was breaking up in confusion, rushing from room to\r\nroom, some peering into the street, some fighting their way downstairs,\r\na shell came whizzing through the corner window and burst against the\r\nopposite wall. From the description and the hole it made, I think it\r\nwas a segment or percussion shell, but it was followed rapidly by\r\ncase-shot, and at so short a range it is possible that nothing but case\r\nshot was used. For the guns had been placed in a main street, at not\r\nmuch more than fifty yards’ distance, and commanded an uninterrupted\r\nsight of the whole top story. At once the fatal disadvantage of the\r\nrevolutionists was seen. Probably there was not a man among them who\r\ncould have thrown a bomb fifty yards clear; but to the Government’s\r\nguns it was a childish range even for case-shot, and without cause\r\nfor pride they could throw shrapnel and percussion bombs up to four\r\nthousand yards two or three times a minute.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of the house continued for about half an hour, the\r\nshells crashing through the windows and against the brickwork, but not\r\ndoing very much damage except to furniture and glass, for most of the\r\nrevolutionists were crowded together on the staircase, and many were\r\nescaping through backyards and over walls. A few, however, with great\r\ngallantry remained and kept up a revolver-fire from the windows to\r\ncover the retreat of the others. Four or five of them were killed by\r\nshell-fire, and fifteen were badly wounded. It was said next day that\r\nFiedler was among the killed, and I was told how he had stood outside\r\na window in defiance and been blown to pieces. I was even shown bits\r\nof his coat and trousers still sticking to the window-frame; but I was\r\nnot quite convinced, especially when I heard of his being shot in gaol\r\na fortnight later. In such cases it is hardly ever possible to discover\r\nthe truth from either side. Even eye-witnesses are generally too\r\nexcited or too terrified to see, and the Russian Government lives\r\nupon the lie.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIEDLER’S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EFFECT OF SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nTowards midnight, a hundred and twenty revolutionists, including ten\r\ngirls, surrendered. A high official told me next day that the girls had\r\nbeen released, but it is not thus that the Government treats girls,\r\nand I know now that he was lying or repeating a lie. As to the rest,\r\nhe admitted they would be shot, because the prisons were already too\r\nfull to hold them. The loss of over a hundred was a very serious thing\r\nfor the party of progress. All manner of estimates of the revolutionary\r\nfighting strength have been made. Some of the best authorities said\r\nthey refused to put it over 15,000 men. A very careful onlooker, who\r\ncertainly had special opportunities of knowing, fixed on 1,500 as\r\nthe just figure. The revolutionists themselves maintained, and still\r\nmaintain, that only 500 were engaged on the barricades. In that case,\r\nthey had lost a sixth part of their force at the first stroke, and they\r\ncould not afford to lose a man. For myself, I believe no estimate of\r\nnumbers in wartime, unless given by the man who issues rations--and\r\nto the revolutionists no one issued rations. But to me it is utterly\r\nincredible that only 500 were opposed to the Government troops during\r\nthe following nine days. Five hundred is only half a battalion, and\r\nevery colonel knows how tiny a handful even a full battalion is when it\r\ncomes into action. They may mean that only 500 were adequately armed,\r\nbut in that case the estimate is too high. The revolutionists were said\r\nto have possessed two or three machine-guns, though I never saw them\r\nor heard them, and attribute the rumour to the identity of the word\r\nfor machine-gun and repeating rifle (_Pulemet_). But by their own\r\nadmission they had only eighty rifles, with very few cartridges, and\r\nthe remainder were armed with various kinds of revolver, especially the\r\nso-called “Brownings” of Belgian make. They are good enough weapons,\r\nand will kill at a hundred yards if they hit at all. But few revolvers\r\ncan be depended on over twenty yards, and I have never found them much\r\ngood, except as a moral influence, or for the re-assuring comfort of\r\nsuicide _in extremis_.\r\n\r\nFive hundred could not have done the work. That night the face of\r\na third of Moscow was changed. The morning brought rumours of an\r\nassault on the Nicolai station with the loss of 200 men; of assaults\r\non the Government house and the Prefecture of police; but, worse than\r\nall, of a serious rising in some cotton and lace mills south of the\r\ncity, and the probable danger of several English overseers and their\r\nfamilies. Driving out early in a sledge to the beginning of the open\r\ncountry, near the place on the river where the Russian people once\r\nbuilt a house for their painter Verestchagin, I found a few families\r\nof Lancastrians and Nottingham men, anxious and apprehensive indeed\r\nbut not surrounded by bloodthirsty mobs as we had heard. The hands on\r\nstrike had been marching with red flags up and down the road as usual\r\nthe day before and singing the “Marseillaise,” when they were set upon\r\nin front and rear by Dragoons and Cossacks with the usual results. Now\r\nthey were hanging about their factories or living-barracks, indignant\r\nand dangerous with the sense of wrong, but outwardly quiet, and only\r\ncursing and threatening us with fists and stones as we went about\r\namong them. Not that the English overseers were hated. In themselves\r\nthey were popular, but as the rulers and the best-paid workmen, with\r\nseparate houses of their own, they were marked as the representatives\r\nof overwhelming capitalism.\r\n\r\nAs I looked out over the silent mills to the open country and wretched\r\nvillages beyond, the sound of a big gun suddenly came from Moscow.\r\nTurning round, I saw the great city glittering with domes and crosses,\r\ndistinct with towers and lines of brilliant light under the frosty sun,\r\nwhile all the church bells were booming and tinkling for the vigil of\r\nsome feast. Again came the sound of a gun, and then again, and I had\r\nknown from the first there was no mistaking it. I had not then heard of\r\nthe attack on Fiedler’s house, for one of the peculiarities of Russian\r\nlife is that the Last Judgment might be in progress in one street\r\nwhile, unaware of your danger, you continued increasing your record of\r\nsins in the next. But now there could be doubt no longer; the open war\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour I was crossing the bridge and climbing the Kremlin hill\r\nto the Red Square. Crowds of well-dressed people, clerks, and shop-boys\r\nwere hurrying past me away from the city. In spite of the strike, they\r\nhad walked in by habit that morning, or merely to see what was going\r\non. But guns in the street were a breach of business habits, and now\r\nthey had seen enough and preferred to lunch at home. Similarly, I\r\nthink, Brixton would be unusually full at midday if the shells were\r\nbursting in Cheapside; and it was in the Cheapside of Moscow that the\r\nguns were then at work.\r\n\r\nIf we may take Moscow as a circle with the Kremlin for centre, it was\r\non the north-west segment of the circle that the revolutionists made\r\ntheir most serious attack. Certainly, there were other attacks as\r\nwell--two on the St. Petersburg station, against which the whole effort\r\nof the rising ought to have been concentrated; and one attack was made\r\non the Rezan station close by. The rumour came in every morning for the\r\nnext week that both had been burnt to the ground, though when I visited\r\nthem, I always found them untouched. Other attacks were also made,\r\nand there was a certain amount of fighting on the south side of the\r\nwandering little river. But the main interest lay in that north-west\r\nsegment, of which the Tverskaya, the Dmitrovka, and Petrovka are the\r\nmain radii, while the Boulevards enclosing the “White Town” form the\r\nnearer of the two concentric arcs, and the Sadovaya, or garden circle,\r\nthe further. The Sadovaya, which runs round the whole city, was a real\r\ncircumference or boundary to the fighting area during the first few\r\ndays, and if one started from the red triumphal arch near the Nicolai\r\nstation, and followed the arc westward and south till the river was\r\nreached, the whole scene of action would be included in that segment.\r\nBut concentric circles make the most puzzling plan on which a town\r\ncan be built, because it is difficult in walking to allow for the\r\nalmost imperceptible curves. Only in Moscow and Monastir have I seen\r\nsuch arrangements of streets, and only in those two towns have I ever\r\nhesitated about my way.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionists had chosen this segment for attack because it\r\ncontained the Government house, the Prefecture of Police, the great\r\nCentral Prison, from which the exiles used to start for Siberia, and at\r\nleast three important barracks. As far as they had any definite plan\r\nat all, their idea seems to have been to drive a kind of wedge into\r\nthe heart of the city, supporting the advance by barricades on each\r\nside, so as to hamper the approach of troops. The point of the wedge\r\nwas to be driven down the Tverskaya as far as the Government house,\r\nand if once that position had been gained, they probably hoped that\r\nthe rest would be easy. Accordingly, during the night they had thrown\r\nup barricades across all streets leading into the Tverskaya beyond the\r\ncircle of the Boulevards, and in all streets parallel to it. By morning\r\nthe point of the wedge had nearly reached the open space where the\r\nBoulevard runs and the Pushkin statue confronts the Strasnoi Convent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MINOR BARRICADE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MILITARY POST AT MOSCOW.]\r\n\r\nThat was the main and serious line of attack, as the revolutionists\r\ndesigned it. But at the time it was hard to understand their purpose,\r\nfor in street fighting one can get no view, the firing comes from many\r\nsides at once, and you are open to equal danger from friend or foe.\r\nThere is no front or rear, and you feel you are nothing but flanks. To\r\nevery point of the compass you are exposed; there is no obvious line of\r\nadvance, for the enemy may always be behind you. And there is no line\r\nof retreat, for at any moment your communications with your base may be\r\ncut, and you may be shot at for hours from street to street before you\r\ncan get home for food or sleep. But the greatest difficulty in grasping\r\nthe situation at once arose from the mere numbers of the barricades\r\nwhich had been already thrown up since the previous night. Over a large\r\npart of the district barricades had grown up quite at random. They\r\nappeared in every lane. Miniature barricades crossed the footpaths on\r\nthe Boulevard gardens. They were especially thick in the Tsvietnoi,\r\nor Flower Boulevard, and often so flimsy that a push would knock them\r\nover. As signs of spiritual grace, nothing could have been nobler, for\r\nthey were the work of high-hearted young men and girls, who, having\r\nread that barricades are the proper things in revolution, hastened to\r\nbuild them anywhere and anyhow. Tubs, shutters, gates, iron railings,\r\ntelegraph poles, and front doors were hurriedly piled across a street\r\nor path, and left standing there as a menace to tyrants. So they were\r\na menace to tyrants. Every bandbox there proved the deep-rooted hatred\r\nto tyranny. But not one of them would stop a bullet, and there was no\r\npossibility or intention of defending them for a moment. They were the\r\nwork of splendid children learning to make war, and when at last they\r\nwere torn up and burnt, one passed over their smouldering ruins with\r\nthe regret we feel for broken toys.\r\n\r\nThe very multitude of these barricades (early next morning I counted\r\none hundred and thirty of them, and I had not seen nearly half) made\r\nit difficult to understand the main purpose of all the fighting, when\r\nI found myself suddenly plunged into the middle of it that first\r\nafternoon. Alone, and very ignorant both of the language and the\r\ntown, I could not at first discover any design on either side, beyond\r\nsetting up barricades and knocking them down again. It seemed as if\r\nthe Government might have left the revolutionists alone, and simply\r\nissued a proclamation to the citizens of Moscow: “Keep your streets\r\nblocked up if you like. We should have thought it inconvenient, but\r\nit really makes no difference to us.” Like most other people, I had\r\nno experience of street fighting to guide me, and it was with this\r\nsense of uncertainty and bewilderment that I made my way from point to\r\npoint towards the part of the Tverskaya from which the sound of guns\r\ncame. To get into the main street itself was impossible, for every\r\napproach was guarded by sentries, who cried “Halt!” and then fired\r\nwith inconsiderate rapidity. To the crowds of peaceful citizens, such\r\nbehaviour was novel and pleasantly exciting. They gathered in thick\r\ngroups behind the shelter of any street corner, or up the passages, and\r\neven in the porches of big shops and banks. Every now and then some one\r\nwould snatch off his cap and dash across an exposed street as though\r\nhe were finishing for a hundred yards. The crowd held their breaths\r\nand watched eagerly, hoping to see him fall, as an audience hopes to\r\nsee the tight-rope girl break her neck. But when he reached safety and\r\nwaved his arms, they cheered and another started.\r\n\r\nBy similar means, except that national vanity made me walk instead\r\nof running, I reached the Petrovka (the Lombard-street of Moscow,\r\nparallel to the Tverskaya, and below it down a hill), and made my\r\nway along it till I came to the Boulevard near the Trouba where the\r\nErmitage restaurant stands. Looking up to the left I could there see\r\nthe Pushkin statue, and watch the flash of the guns in position on the\r\nhigh open space that commands the cross roads of the Tverskaya and\r\nthe Boulevard in both directions. Up the hill the Boulevard was quite\r\nempty, but in the hollow at the foot a few people were hurrying to and\r\nfro. Some were model citizens, who would rather die than break through\r\nthe habits of every day; some were women who had to provide the Sunday\r\ndinner anyhow. But most were possessed by the curious instinct which\r\ndrives even the gentlest men and women to witness fighting and death\r\nagainst their will.\r\n\r\nHoping to discover the true position of the revolutionists, I started\r\nto cross the Boulevard myself, keeping under cover of the snowy trees\r\nwhenever I could. In the middle I saw a girl coming towards me--an\r\nordinary workgirl with a shawl over her head. Apparently she also had\r\ncome for curiosity, for all her rosy face was smiling with excitement.\r\nBut as I looked at it, a little red splash fell upon her cheek, and\r\ninstantly the side of her neck and the knot of the shawl turned red.\r\nShe stood still, drew in her breath with a gasp, and then sat down in\r\nthe snow crying. I jammed my handkerchief against the wound, but the\r\nbullet had only just touched her as it fell, and seeing there was no\r\nhole in the face I signalled to her to run, and away she went into the\r\nPetrovka, screaming for a sledge.\r\n\r\nGoing on, I had to leave the trees and cross the open road. At the\r\nentrance to a yard there, I found a small group of people leaning over\r\nanother woman, who had just been hit and was lying helpless on the\r\npavement, her eyes white and her breath coming and going heavily. She\r\nwas a well-dressed girl in a long fur coat, possibly a revolutionist,\r\nbut more likely a sympathetic spectator. The bullet had struck through\r\nher skirts, and a man was trying to stop the terrible bleeding by\r\ntwisting two handkerchiefs round the leg. We carried her unconscious to\r\na large house about a hundred yards up the hill, where a red-cross flag\r\nwas flying. It may have been a permanent hospital, for the ambulance\r\nstations, afterwards organized by the Zemstvo or Town Council, were\r\nnot ready then. The soldiers did not fire at us, though we had come\r\ninto close range. All through those early days of the fighting, the red\r\ncross was respected, and people who were carrying the wounded, even\r\nwithout the ambulance badges, were not often fired at. A change came\r\nlater on, and even to red-cross girls no mercy was shown. This change\r\nwas due to a special order from Admiral Dubasoff.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned from the hospital door, I found my position excellent\r\nbut uncomfortable. The protection of the wounded had brought me safely\r\nup close to the very centre of the situation; but now that protection\r\nwas withdrawn. I could not stand still, and to go back meant a long\r\nretirement down the open road fully exposed to fire from end to end.\r\nThe only chance was to go on, and as the entrance to the next street\r\nwas only about fifty yards away, I gathered up my fur coat and ran\r\nfor it. Turning sharply round the corner, I found myself in the Mala\r\nDmitrovka, a wide street down which the electric trams run in quiet\r\ntimes. It looked painfully open and empty. Lamp-posts had been knocked\r\ndown and laid across the road, telegraph wires had been cut and strewn\r\non the pavement or tied into entanglements, and the overhead strands\r\nfor electricity hung in festoons, threatening the heads of horsemen.\r\nI saw at once that I had reached the zone between the contending\r\nforces, an admirable position for the military student, but otherwise\r\nunpleasing. Still, if I could only go on, I should discover the main\r\nrevolutionary body, and that was my object. So keeping close to the\r\nhouses on the left side, I started along the road at a trot. Only one\r\nother creature was in sight--a man of the bank-clerk type, who was\r\nwalking rapidly in front of me, crouching down to protect his head.\r\nOnce he looked behind to see if I were dangerous, and I was rapidly\r\ngaining on him when, all of a sudden, he sank together and lay down on\r\nthe pavement.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reach him, he was up again and was leaning against a\r\nhouse, trying to take cover behind a down-spout. He could only speak\r\nRussian, but he pointed to his thigh, and I saw the blood running out\r\nover his boot and beginning to soak through the trouser-leg. I looked\r\nround for help, but the blinds in all the houses were down, and the\r\ngates barred and padlocked. Pointing in the direction by which we had\r\ncome, I made him understand there was an ambulance near, and putting\r\none arm round my neck, he began to hop back along the street down which\r\nwe had advanced so fast. Neither of us was now in the least anxious\r\nabout danger, and we listened to the guns and rifles with entire\r\nindifference. But the pain of the movement and the loss of blood were\r\novercoming him; he was turning green, and at last I was obliged to\r\nrest him on a doorstep. I tried binding his leg over the trouser, but\r\nthat did not stop the flow, and the cold was so intense that I did not\r\nlike to take his trousers off. He was falling into unconsciousness,\r\nand I tried in vain to make him crawl a few steps further. Again I\r\nlooked round at the houses, and this time I saw some faces watching me\r\nfrom a window. I waved to them, and presently the front door opened,\r\nand three men and a girl came out, bringing a chair. On that we\r\nsoon carried him down the road to the Red Cross room, and I was left\r\nstanding outside the entrance again. I then discovered that from first\r\nto last we had been exposed to sharpshooters posted on the tower of the\r\nStrastnoi Convent, close by, and all running and cover had been useless.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “GOD WITH US!”\r\n\r\n   From _Sprut_.]\r\n\r\nBut it was now getting dark. Under the protection of the wounded,\r\nI had approached nearer the revolutionary position than I thought\r\npossible at starting, and for once virtue had been something better\r\nthan her own reward. To have put her to the test again would have been\r\nwanton, for one cannot count on always finding an object of protective\r\nphilanthropy. So I made for the trees, and walking down the Boulevard\r\nthrough the deepening twilight, I ran straight into a half-battery\r\nof four guns that was coming up to the relief of the guns beside the\r\nstatue. The scouts, who were thrown out over the space, seized me and\r\nsearched me down, but raised no further objection to my existence.\r\n\r\nThat night I had an engagement in the west of the city, but the streets\r\nbetween were so carefully guarded that I had to creep in the dark\r\nthrough the Old Town and round by the Kremlin along the deserted river\r\nbank to get there, and then it was impossible to come back, for a minor\r\nstate of siege had been declared, and the soldiers were shooting at\r\nanything that moved. A “minor state of siege” only implies that if you\r\nlose your life, or anything else during the time, you have no claim on\r\nthe Government for compensation. It is a convenient arrangement for\r\na bankrupt Government engaged in re-establishing its credit by the\r\nslaughter of its own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                        THE DAYS OF MOSCOW--II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was our Christmas Eve--a Sunday. I had stayed the night,\r\nas I said, in the west of the disturbed district, and in the early\r\nmorning some revolutionists came into the house, and reported large\r\nnumbers of killed--rooms crowded with people all blown to pieces by\r\nthe shells, walls bespattered with blood, and other horrors, which one\r\nalways hears in war, and which are sometimes true. They also said they\r\nhad just taken part in an assault upon a body of unmounted dragoons,\r\nwho were cautiously approaching a barricade when the revolutionists\r\nopened fire upon them with revolvers from the houses on both sides, and\r\nkilled ten. The men themselves were worn with sleepless excitement.\r\nThey remained muffled up in their overcoats, and kept one hand\r\nfingering at the revolvers in their pockets.\r\n\r\nSoon after daylight, the church bells began to ring for Divine service,\r\nand the big guns sounded again from the Tverskaya. Finding that\r\nsentries were still driving back every one who approached that part of\r\nthe town, I went round by the University and reached the great Theatre\r\nSquare in front of the Hotel Métropole. The battery of eight guns,\r\nwhich had been hidden inside the hotel, was now fully displayed across\r\nthe square, apparently in readiness to bombard the Opera House. But,\r\nin fact, the guns were placed there only for reinforcement and to keep\r\nup a panic among the crowd, who came out now and then and watched them\r\nwith interest from the opposite side, and then rushed away in sudden\r\nterror. Crossing the square in front of the battery, I was going up the\r\nstreet at the side of the hotel when I found a party of dustmen and\r\npolice loading a cart with some bodies that lay upon the street. The\r\nthings hardly looked human, they were so small and still and shapeless.\r\nTheir faces were burnt away; their clothes black, and so charred that\r\nthey crumbled into cinders like burnt paper as the body was heaved into\r\nthe cart.\r\n\r\nI then saw that in the side of the hotel a vast black space had been\r\nblown out, like the entrance to a smoky cavern. It was the site of a\r\ngun-shop, which I had often examined with some curiosity and wonder;\r\nfor a gunmaker’s is a dangerous trade in revolution. From a man who\r\nlived exactly opposite, I heard the story afterwards. Late on the\r\nSaturday evening a party of revolutionists went boldly across the\r\nstreet, and broke into the shop with hammers and axes. Other people\r\nappeared, and a small crowd had gathered, when a detachment of\r\nsoldiers came round from the hotel and fired into the middle of them.\r\nThey ran; but the soldiers went back, and the crowd gathered again.\r\nThis happened twice, and then the soldiers, being evidently terrified\r\nthemselves, left the place alone. The revolutionists appear to have\r\ndeparted with their plunder, but a number of people remained searching\r\nabout for what they could get, lighting matches and using long rolls\r\nof paper as candles. Just at midnight there was an immense explosion,\r\nand all that was left of the shop, together with the people in it, was\r\nblown into the street. The eye-witness described the ground as littered\r\nwith dead, many of them in flames. Those were the charred bodies I saw\r\nbeing removed; the others, who were killed and wounded by the soldiers,\r\nhad already gone. But it seemed to me probable that the explosion was\r\npurposely caused by the revolutionaries, either to create terror, or to\r\ndestroy the powder they could not use. What arms were actually obtained\r\nI cannot say. Many sporting guns had been in the window, but I had\r\nnever seen any rifles or revolvers, though I had looked carefully, with\r\nthis probability in view.\r\n\r\nMy own little hotel was close by, and after calling there, I went on\r\nto the nearest point of the circular Boulevard, only a hundred yards\r\nbeyond. Here there was a clear view over the valley by the Ermitage\r\nand up the opposite hill to the Pushkin statue. A good many people\r\nhad taken cover behind the trees, and were watching and listening, but\r\nthe terror had much increased and there remained none of the sporting\r\nspirit of the day before. Death was too near and obvious now. Almost\r\nevery instant a bullet came whizzing over the valley and was heard\r\ncutting through the trees or falling with a tiny hiss in the snow.\r\nAt the corner of my street, close to a white monastery with a great\r\nclassic tower, they had opened a back yard as a refuge for the wounded,\r\nthough it did not fly the red cross, I think because it was privately\r\nmanaged by the revolutionists for their own people. The line of wounded\r\nwho were hurried into it, dazed and groaning, was almost continuous,\r\nand all were received, whether revolutionists or not. Under an open\r\nshed inside I found a pitiful row of the dead lying on the stones, some\r\nterribly shattered by shell-fire, some killed by the rifle, so merciful\r\nwhen it strikes the brain or heart. We had helped in a man who was\r\nstreaming blood from a shot in the neck, and we had hardly laid him\r\ndown when a poor red-bearded peasant, all shaggy and caked from the\r\nfields, was dragged inside, his face dull white except at a great hole\r\nby his nose. But he was already dead and was put beside the others.\r\nBetween the stones of that yard for the first time I saw men’s blood\r\ntrickling as in a gutter.\r\n\r\nHitherto many of the wounded and dying had been galloped up to the\r\nambulance yards in sledges, but now I saw a driver who was hailed for\r\na wounded girl turn sharp round and dash out of sight.\r\n\r\nAnother sledge was seized, but this driver also lashed his horse and\r\ntried to get away. He was dragged out of the sledge, and his arms were\r\nbound with his own whip, while two men, supporting the girl between\r\nthem, brought her up the hill to the yard. Soon afterwards the sledges\r\ndisappeared altogether, and for some days none could be had. It was\r\nsaid the drivers were afraid of having them taken for barricades; more\r\nprobably they were only afraid of being shot, and in any case it was\r\nnot profitable to carry the wounded. I believe the Government also\r\nforbade them running lest they should help revolutionists to escape.\r\n\r\nLeaving the yard, I went down the hill and along the Petrovka, where\r\nthe guns had battered two or three houses to pieces because a revolver\r\nhad been fired from the windows. I had hoped to get into the Tverskaya\r\nby a little lane at the back of the Opera House, but the pickets were\r\nstill keeping up a random fire down all those cross streets, and many\r\npassers-by were struck. One soldier deliberately aimed at an oldish\r\nman who was going along the Petrovka like myself. The man fell into a\r\npile of snow by the edge of the road and kept on struggling to rise.\r\nBut each time, when he had nearly got up, he lurched heavily forward\r\nagain and fell on his face like a drunken man. The soldier who had hit\r\nhim came up with another soldier and looked at his wound. Then they\r\nshouted to an ambulance cart that was passing the end of the street,\r\nand lifting the man carefully on to it, they sent him off to the Hotel\r\nMétropole, at the back of which, I think, the Zemstvo were establishing\r\ntheir main ambulance depôt for soldiers and civilians alike. It is\r\nnot often that a man who has done his utmost to kill another can so\r\nspeedily do his utmost to keep him alive.\r\n\r\nUnable to reach the guns from that side, I then determined to get in\r\nfront of them and try to discover again what the revolutionists really\r\nintended. So I turned back and after some difficulty reached the\r\nmain street of the Dmitrovka (Bolchaya Dmitrovka) which runs closely\r\nparallel to the Tverskaya. There I found a woman stooping over a body\r\nwhich lay on the curb-stone. It was a boy of about fifteen, dressed in\r\nthe school uniform of a little blue cap and long grey overcoat. He had\r\ncome out to see a battle--a real battle with men shooting bullets and\r\nslashing with swords. His little boots were close together, pointing\r\nupwards; his white-gloved hands thrown out upon the snow like a cross;\r\nand through his mouth was the dark red hole where the bullet had struck\r\nhim. The woman had seen him fall and had come from her house. Two or\r\nthree others now gathered round, and she brought out a red and white\r\ntable-cloth in which we wrapt him. So we carried him to an ambulance\r\nroom in a lane beside an ancient red-brick church close by. But he was\r\ndead before we reached the door.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the Boulevard again, I was close to the Pushkin statue,\r\nso often mentioned because hitherto it had been the advance position\r\nof the guns. But now they had been taken forward further along the\r\nTverskaya, and the square was empty but for a few sentries. The\r\nsharpshooters had also been removed from the Strestnoi bell-tower, but\r\nthe Russian common people will long remember the impiety which placed\r\nthem there, and a fine satiric cartoon represents them as they fired\r\nupon the crowd below, with the inscription, “God with us!” The Mala\r\nDmitrovka, where the clerk had fallen in front of me the day before,\r\nwas absolutely empty now, and I passed right along it without any\r\ninterruption except for the wire entanglements. It brought me out, as\r\nI had hoped, upon the Sadovaya, or Garden Boulevard, which forms the\r\nouter circle round Moscow, as I described before, and reaching the\r\npoint of intersection I saw at once that I had come to the very centre\r\nof the revolutionist position.\r\n\r\nThe four arms of the cross-road were all blocked with double or even\r\ntreble barricades, about ten yards apart. As far as I could see\r\nalong the curve of the Sadovaya on both sides, barricade succeeded\r\nbarricade, and the whole road was covered with telegraph wire, some of\r\nit lying loose, some tied across like netting. The barricades enclosing\r\nthe centre of the cross-road like a fort were careful constructions of\r\ntelegraph poles or the iron supports to the overhead wires of electric\r\ntrams, closely covered over with doors, railings, and advertisement\r\nboards, and lashed together with wire. Here and there a carriage or\r\ntramcar was built in, to give stability, and from the top of every\r\nbarricade waved the little red flag. A similar fort had been built\r\nat the intersection of the Sadovaya with the Tverskaya, only a short\r\ndistance to the right, and the whole of the road between was thronged\r\nwith excited people, who hastened backwards and forwards, stood in\r\neager groups at all the corners, and kept peering down the Tverskaya\r\nto discover if the guns were yet in sight. But the troops were\r\nadvancing slowly, if at all. At intervals the guns fired--generally\r\ntwo in rapid succession--and we could hear the crash of the shells as\r\nthey plunged into the houses or brought the brickwork rattling down.\r\nEvery now and then came a quick outburst of rifle-shots--perhaps\r\nof revolver-shots--and a bullet or two went humming overhead. Each\r\nbarricade was being assaulted separately, the guns firing first, and\r\nthen the soldiers creeping up with rifles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BARRICADES ON THE SADOVAYA.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not from the barricades themselves that the real opposition\r\ncame. From first to last no barricade was “fought,” in the old sense\r\nof the word. To be sure, we afterwards saw photographs of enthusiastic\r\nrevolutionists standing on the very summit of the barriers, clear\r\nagainst the sky, and waving red flags or presenting revolvers at space.\r\nBut no such things happened, and the photographs were a simple kind of\r\n“fake.” The barricades were never intended to be “fought.” The only\r\ntactics of the revolutionists were ambush and surprise. Afterwards I\r\nheard stories of them lying down across the street in front of the\r\nadvancing troops, and meeting case-shot and rifles with revolvers that\r\ncannot be trusted over twenty yards. Such stories are too ludicrous\r\nto be denied. The revolutionary methods were far more terrible and\r\neffective. By the side-street barricades and wire entanglements, they\r\nhad rid themselves of the fear of cavalry. By the barricades across\r\nthe main streets, they rendered the approach of troops necessarily\r\nslow. To the soldiers, the horrible part of the street fighting was\r\nthat they could never see the real enemy. On coming near a barricade\r\nor the entrance to a side street, a few scouts would be advanced a\r\nshort distance before the guns. As they crept forward, firing, as they\r\nalways did, into the empty barricade in front, they might suddenly\r\nfind themselves exposed to a terrible revolver-fire at about fifteen\r\npaces range from both sides of the street. It was useless to reply,\r\nfor there was nothing visible to aim at. All they could do was to\r\nfire blindly in almost any direction, and perhaps the bullets killed\r\nsome mother carrying home the family potatoes half a mile away. Then\r\nthe revolver-firing would suddenly cease, the guns would trundle up\r\nand wreck the houses on both sides. Windows fell crashing on the\r\npavement, case-shot burst in the bedrooms, and solid shell made round\r\nholes through three or four walls. It was bad for furniture, but the\r\nrevolutionists had long ago escaped through a labyrinth of courts at\r\nthe back, and were already preparing a similar attack in another street.\r\n\r\nAmong all those excited groups it was quite impossible to distinguish\r\nthe sympathetic spectator or even the spy from the fighting\r\nrevolutionist. It all seemed to me like an Aldershot field-day, in\r\nwhich the regulars on one side were fighting with ball cartridge\r\nagainst the usual crowd of onlookers, some of whom were secretly armed.\r\n\r\nLeaving the central forts, I went for half a mile further along\r\nthe continuation of the Dmitrovka, which here takes the name of\r\nDolgoroukovskaya, and from end to end I found it crowded with\r\nwork-people of the better class, all intensely excited and alert, and\r\napparently all enthusiastic for the movement. But even when a man tried\r\nto work up trouble because I looked foreign and fairly well-dressed, I\r\ncould not distinguish for certain which were the real revolutionists\r\namong them. The whole long street had been admirably barricaded, and\r\nas it runs out towards the Petrovsky Park and the open country, it\r\nseemed likely that it had been specially prepared as a line of retreat\r\nin case of disaster. Barricades were erected every thirty yards, and\r\nin one place the whole of the electric train had been drawn at right\r\nangles across the road in three lines, making far the largest barricade\r\nthen existing in the world. Naturally the revolutionists were proud\r\nof it as a triumph of engineering art. Four red flags flew from its\r\nsummit, and upon the largest flag some girl had stitched the white\r\nletters, “For Freedom.” But there was another barricade which seemed to\r\nme simpler and finer in conception. Some revolutionists, probably boys,\r\nhad piled a great wall of snow across the road, and then by pouring\r\nbuckets of water upon it under the freezing sky, had converted it into\r\nan almost solid rampart of ice, which I doubt if any bullet could have\r\npenetrated. That was the barricade of genius.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the central forts on the Sadovaya, the firing of the\r\nbig guns had slackened, and I found out the reason afterwards. At the\r\ntime I thought it was because the early dusk of mid-winter was falling,\r\nand having waited for a while to watch some revolutionary Red Cross\r\nparties set out in different directions, I made a short cut for home\r\nby way of the Flower Boulevard (Tsvietnoi). But as I was going along\r\nits valley towards the Ermitage, four big flashes in front, looking\r\nvery orange in the twilight, warned me that guns had been brought down\r\nthere to demolish the series of little barricades running across, the\r\ngardens where I was. I think the troops were afraid of a flank attack\r\non their right if they advanced further without clearing this ground,\r\nand, indeed, the barricades throughout the quarter were still rapidly\r\nincreasing. Men and girls were throwing them up with devoted zeal,\r\nsawing through telegraph-poles, wrenching ironwork from its sockets,\r\nand dragging out the planks from builders’ yards. I could still find\r\nno directing spirit--no general or staff to give orders for the whole\r\narmy, as it were. But there must have been some sort of agreement in\r\nactions like this, and probably, if I had been able to converse like\r\nthe rest, I should not have remained ignorant. But the foreigner,\r\nhowever well disposed, is inevitably suspected, and even offers of help\r\nin carrying and building are very coldly received, or rejected with\r\nthreats. Yet I was much less likely than a Russian to be a spy, and no\r\none could suffer greater mortification than being thus excluded from\r\nthe party of revolt.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the hill where my hotel stood, I found that even in\r\nour own insignificant street, two barricades were being erected--one\r\nvery conveniently placed just below my window--and the side streets\r\nleading down into the Petrovka were similarly blocked. The soldiers had\r\nevidently fired up these streets whilst the building was going on,\r\nfor a bullet passing through a hotel window and wall and ceiling had\r\nleft a memorial which the inhabitants continued to contemplate with\r\npleasurable awe. The hotel cook also, having a moment of leisure in his\r\nkitchen, had run out into the yard to enjoy the battle, and leaning\r\nforward round a corner to gain the best possible view, had received a\r\nbullet through the heart. Now stretched in the stable, he cooked no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nLate at night a strange figure appeared in the hall and stood thawing\r\nin front of the fire. It was dressed like a peasant, but surely\r\nno peasant since Adam’s fall ever looked quite so comfortable and\r\nself-satisfied, and no peasant’s clothes were quite so clean since\r\nAdam’s first day in hides. After warming himself and peering about for\r\na little while with twinkling eyes, he took off the peasant’s raiment\r\nbit by bit, and stood before us in full uniform, a police-officer\r\nrevealed. He had not come as an avenger, but with wrath restrained he\r\nonly demanded figures regarding the dead, and he even stooped to take\r\na special interest in the cook. There is a peculiar quality about the\r\nRussian official--a kind of friendliness in brutality, a brotherliness\r\nin slaughter--which springs from the sense of human kinship. Presently\r\nthe hired assassin showed himself quite benign and communicative.\r\nHe displayed revolutionary leanings. He informed us that if only\r\nthe insurgents could maintain the fight for three days longer, the\r\nsoldiers would be overcome. Already they were worn out with constant\r\nwatching and harassing marches hither and thither without relief. The\r\nnews, if true, could only mean that a large part of the garrison could\r\nnot be relied upon by the Government, for otherwise there were plenty\r\nof troops in the city to supply reliefs. I believe the garrison then\r\nnumbered eight infantry regiments (much undermanned, it is true), two\r\nCossack regiments, one and a half of dragoons, and two brigades of\r\nguns. In all, the numbers were then estimated at eighteen thousand--not\r\nvery many, it is true, but surely enough to hold a city against\r\nill-armed insurgents. Something must evidently be strange in the temper\r\nof the men. So that peasant police-officer discoursed, and the hearts\r\nof his hearers were full of hope or dismay according to their inborn\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight there was a sudden outburst of rifle-fire outside my\r\nwindow. A party of soldiers were assaulting the little barricade, which\r\nI had already come to regard with a sense of personal property. They\r\npoured bullet after bullet into it, but still it held out as long as\r\nit could, and only surrendered at last because it had no defenders.\r\nBringing up copies of some suppressed organ of liberty as kindling, the\r\nsoldiers then set it on fire, and it burnt slowly till dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        THE DAYS OF MOSCOW--III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many battles there comes a moment when little or nothing appears\r\nto have changed, and yet you suddenly realize that all is over but\r\nthe running. Such a moment came on the morning of Christmas Day as\r\nI went up the Sadovaya towards the central revolutionist position\r\nwhere I had been the afternoon before. The barricades were still\r\nstanding, the Sodovaya was still covered with such a network of wire\r\nabout four feet from the ground that one had to walk under it bent\r\ndouble like a hoop, and no horse could have moved. The guns had not\r\ncome perceptibly nearer, and in the centre of the town I had seen an\r\nofficer stopped and deprived of his sword by half a dozen men with\r\nrevolvers, who threatened to strip him naked, as another had been\r\nstripped the day before. There were rumours of all manner of wild\r\nenterprises on foot--attacks on stations, on prisons, on barracks. All\r\nthese were favourable signs. Yet as I went along, I suddenly realized,\r\n“instinctively” as it is called, that the tide had turned, and that\r\nthe highest moment of revolutionary success lay behind us.\r\n\r\nI was so convinced of this that, wishing to photograph the barricades\r\nbefore they disappeared, I went all the way back to the hotel for my\r\nkodak. There was a brilliant sun, and as the firing had not yet become\r\nsevere, I walked leisurely through the main position, selecting in my\r\nmind the best places; for I had only one roll of films left, the rest\r\nhaving gone down the line. As on the previous day, a good many people\r\nwere moving about in groups, besides the usual number of women passing\r\nup and down unconcernedly, since children must be fed, revolution or\r\nnot. But from a number of unconscious signs, I felt the place was to\r\nbe abandoned, and it appeared likely that the fighting revolutionists\r\nhad already gone. So I began taking the views, and had just secured a\r\nfine construction of doors, benches, barrels, railings, shop-signs,\r\nand trees, when I found myself surrounded by a group of young men,\r\nevidently displeased. I soon perceived I had fallen into the midst\r\nof my friends. They were very quiet about it, and only one of them\r\nspoke. He was a dark Pole of about twenty-five, dirty and red-eyed\r\nwith sleepless fighting, and he appeared to be informing me that I\r\nwas a spy and must at once give up my camera. To make his meaning\r\nplainer, he stealthily drew a revolver from his coat pocket, and held\r\nit close against my side, whilst he repeated his demands in the same\r\nlow voice. In two or three unknown tongues I appealed to him and\r\nthe others, who had now closed in all round me, ready with the same\r\nstealthy argument. I smiled my hardest, assuring them I was at least as\r\ngood a revolutionist by nature as they, and would rather explode the\r\nuniversal spheres than betray a stick of their barricades. I think they\r\nunderstood the smile, for their manner became less anti-social. But\r\nthere was a movement among the crowd, and as I tried to escape in it,\r\nthey again grew painfully insistent. In the end I had to give up the\r\nroll of films, and with that they appeared content, for they graciously\r\nlet me keep the camera. But by their action their finest barricades\r\nlost a chance of immortality.\r\n\r\nThe incident only proved how impossible it was to know where the\r\nrevolutionists were stationed, or in what force. There was nothing\r\nto distinguish these men from the numbers of others with whom they\r\nwere mixing quite freely. It is true that, after this experience, I\r\nrecognized them almost by intuition. As though by a law of nature,\r\nthey assumed the conspirators’ habit--the hat drawn down to the eyes,\r\nthe long coat with the collar turned up, the hand constantly feeling\r\nin the pocket, the quick look of suspicion glancing every way. After\r\na few days I think I could have picked out the leaders simply by\r\ntheir pale and intellectual faces, or their appearance of nervous and\r\nbloodshot excitement. But the possession of a revolver was the only\r\nadmissible evidence, and that required search. By the soldiers it was\r\ntaken as sufficient evidence for death without phrase, and any one\r\ncaught with a revolver in his pocket had no further chance. Of course,\r\nthe revolutionists were aware of this, and knew that death was as good\r\nas surrender. Whilst I was among them that morning, for instance, an\r\nEnglish officer only a few streets away saw five men suddenly come upon\r\na strong picket. They were summoned to halt, but, instead of halting,\r\nthey walked quietly on, taking no notice. One after another they were\r\nshot down, till only one was left, and he also walked on, taking no\r\nnotice. Then he was shot, and there was an end of the five. No doubt\r\nthe more usual form of courage would have been to rush upon the picket\r\nand die fighting. But they may have been out of cartridges, and in any\r\ncase it would be hard to surpass their example in passive bravery.\r\n\r\nIn expectation of sudden death like theirs, all the students, both\r\nmen and girls, had stitched little labels inside the backs of their\r\ncoats, so that, when they were killed, their parents might possibly\r\nhear the news and know the pride of having produced an adventurous\r\nchild. I think most of the revolutionists had done the same, but the\r\ndead were piled up and carted into the country for burial with such\r\nindiscriminate carelessness, that I doubt if the precaution was of\r\nvery much avail. And, indeed, it was not the revolutionist who suffered\r\nmost during the days of combat, but the sightseers and the ordinary\r\npassers-by.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I was very unfortunate all that day. The guns began firing\r\nheavily again about eleven, and I tried many devices to reach their\r\nmain position on the Tverskaya by passing from lane to lane in their\r\nrear. I even reached the Pushkin statue, from which I could see the\r\nlimbers of the guns waiting under cover. But the continual threats of\r\nbayonets and rifles on every side, and the violent searching by the\r\nsentries became strangely demoralizing. Certainly the process of search\r\nthat day was pleasingly simple in my case, because what underclothing I\r\nstill possessed had gone to the wash, and all the shops were shut. But\r\nmy kodak excited the utmost suspicion; all the more, perhaps, because\r\nit was empty now.\r\n\r\nTired of all this, I turned down the main Boulevard westward for an\r\ninterval of peace, but again I was singularly disappointed in my hope.\r\nThe further I went, the more disturbed and dangerous the atmosphere\r\nof things became. Something was evidently happening down that way.\r\nTroops were marching hastily about, and two guns passed at full gallop.\r\nAt one place I heard an officer’s voice shouting some order, and the\r\nfew people on the pavement near me began to run for their lives. I\r\nsaw no reason to run till two soldiers came dashing at me through the\r\ntrees with fixed bayonets. Then running was too late, and, seated on\r\na railing, I awaited them, feeling that the centre of indifference\r\nwas reached at last, and life and death were equal shades. But\r\nsomething induced them to respect so obvious a foreigner, and having\r\nagain searched me and taken half a crown each as their reward for\r\ninternational amenity, they conducted me past an angle of a church and\r\nwaved adieu.\r\n\r\nThen I discovered the reason of all this excitement. New barricades\r\nwere rapidly appearing across many of the streets leading down into\r\nthe Boulevard from the right-hand, or north-west side. I continued\r\nalong the circle almost to the point where the Boulevard ends, close\r\nto the great cathedral of the Saviour near the river, and all the way\r\nI saw signs of fresh conflict and heard sudden outbursts of rifle or\r\nrevolver-firing. It was only after two or three days that I understood\r\nthe real significance of this movement, by which the revolutionists\r\nwere preparing for their final stand in the extreme north-west of the\r\ncity. But at the time I thought they were merely attempting a feint\r\nupon the Government’s left, just as they had tried on the right the day\r\nbefore. It seemed probable, also, that the movement was intended to\r\ncover their withdrawal from the main position where I had lately left\r\nthem. And that, indeed, was their object, though they hoped rather to\r\nchange their centre than to abandon the contest altogether.\r\n\r\nYet the crisis, as I had felt in the morning, was really over. When\r\nI passed through the middle of the city again, and out to my own\r\nquarter, the crowds were still running to and fro in panic round the\r\nTheatre Square, men and women were still falling unexpectedly in the\r\nstreets, there was as much to do as ever in helping the wounded, and\r\nthe ambulance yards were continually being filled. But the life seemed\r\nto have dropped out of the rising. People were talking with terror\r\nof a great peasant invasion, hundreds of thousands strong, that was\r\nalready marching to deliver their Little Mother Moscow, and hew us all\r\nto pieces. With better reason they said that Mischenko, the hero of\r\nthe Japanese war, was coming as military governor with 7,000 Cossacks.\r\nHour by hour the citizens were agitated by new alarms, and the cautious\r\nbegan to think enough had been done for freedom, and to remember\r\nthat something, after all, was due to the sacred stove of home. That\r\nnight the revolutionists issued appeals calling for volunteers at six\r\nshillings a day and a revolver, the term of service to be limited to\r\nthree days. For Russian fighting, or indeed for fighting in any land,\r\nthe pay was magnificent. Even in nations like our own the risk of life\r\nis not valued above two shillings, and though the Russian soldier’s pay\r\nwas raised for this occasion, it only amounted to threepence three\r\nfarthings. It was certainly safer for the moment to be a revolutionist\r\nthan any other kind of citizen, because revolutionists generally\r\nknew which was the enemy and where he lay, but I do not think many\r\nvolunteered for the sake of the pay or the mere delight of firing a\r\nrevolver. Even if any recruits were gained by such inducements, their\r\nfighting, not being inspired by revolutionary spirit, was not likely to\r\nbe glorious.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two days, there was very little outward change in the\r\nposition, except that the feeling of disaster grew, and most people\r\nbegan to recognize the winning side and arrange their own behaviour\r\naccordingly. The guns still sprinkled bullets over the barricades and\r\nwrecked the houses on each side. The soldiers continued their slow\r\nand perilous advance from street to street. People fell at random;\r\nthe hospital and ambulances were crowded beyond limit. On the Tuesday\r\nevening an official estimate put the killed and wounded at between\r\n8,000 and 9,000. In ordinary wars all numbers are exaggerated, but in\r\ncivil war the Government would probably not overstate the number of\r\ntheir victims, and when I went up on Tuesday, the troops had advanced\r\nvery near to the Sadovaya, the firing was very heavy, and many were\r\nhit. But the sense of disaster and failure lay over all, and on that\r\nday, for the first time, I heard revolutionists beginning to\r\ndescribe the whole movement as a dress rehearsal and to congratulate\r\nthemselves upon the excellent practice in street fighting which they\r\nhad enjoyed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n   _Art Reproduction Co._\r\n\r\n  THE NEW ERA.\r\n\r\n   From _Sulphur_ (_Jupel_).]\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday I was unable to go out, except only to cross the\r\nTheatre Square. And there I found a group of soldiers who had just\r\ntaken part in an execution in the middle of the place. Some inmate of a\r\nhotel opposite the Métropole, possessed by a crazy spirit of slaughter\r\nor revolt, had fired a pistol at large from his window. The battery was\r\nplaced in front of the hotel and the surrender of the man demanded. The\r\nproprietor gave him up without dangerous hesitation, and in a minute\r\nor two he was shot in front of the window from which he had fired. One\r\nwould have liked to discover the kind of mania that seized him, but his\r\ndeath made that impossible.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the same day--or perhaps it was the evening\r\nbefore--another execution was carried out, more terrible in its\r\ncircumstances, but better deserved, if any execution is deserved.\r\nA band of revolutionists--the English papers, getting news chiefly\r\nthrough St. Petersburg, said three hundred of them, but that is\r\nabsurd--made their way by some means unobserved to the house of the\r\nchief of the secret police, close to the gendarmes barracks. Knocking\r\nat the door, they demanded to see Voiloshnikoff, the chief himself.\r\nHe came out to them, his wife and children looking on with terror in\r\nthe background, and in spite of the entreaties and tears of woman and\r\nchild, they placed him in front of the door and shot him on the spot.\r\nNo doubt he had done many atrocious things, and had cared little enough\r\nfor the entreaties of women and children himself. But most people\r\nregarded this act of wild justice as inhuman, and regretted, not the\r\npaid criminal’s removal from the world, but the manner of it.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two before daylight next day (Thursday, the 28th), I had\r\nto go to a house on the further side of the Sadovaya to help bring\r\nprovisions and toys for an English family which had taken refuge in the\r\nhotel after spending some dull days in cellars. As we walked through\r\nthe streets standing in silence audible under the transparent darkness\r\nof the morning, we saw the pickets squatting round orange fires of\r\nplanks which they had kindled in the middle of the road. But beyond\r\nsearching us once or twice, they did not interfere with our purpose,\r\nand the only real danger came from the police, who had that morning\r\nreceived brand new rifles--light-coloured things like toys, with fixed\r\nbayonets--which they hugged in both arms, or held horizontally over\r\ntheir shoulders, to the peril of all bystanders, while in their hearts\r\nthey longed to put them to their natural use, with all the tremulous\r\nbravery of girls out rabbit-shooting.\r\n\r\nBut before we reached the Sadovaya, we had passed all the pickets,\r\nand hardly any one was visible on the streets. Some of the barricades\r\nwere on fire or gently smouldering; the rest stood deserted. The\r\npavements were strewn with glass and bricks. Houses on both sides were\r\nruined with shell. Some were burning, and in two or three the beds and\r\nfurniture were being thrown out of the shattered windows. We noticed\r\nhow wild the shell-fire had been, for houses quite a hundred yards\r\nfrom the main streets were struck, evidently at random. But all was\r\nunguarded now. When daylight found us leaving the English flat with our\r\nload, there was still no one visible, and I think a battalion might\r\nhave marched through the district in fours without receiving a shot.\r\nEven the red flags had been removed from the barricades, to be kept,\r\none hopes, for another occasion, and almost the only sign of life was\r\nthat here and there I observed a dvornik (the door-keeper who watches\r\nthe Russian home) cutting down the network of telegraph wire with\r\na hatchet and rolling it up. He reminded me of some trusty servant\r\nmethodically putting away the stage properties on the morning after\r\nprivate theatricals.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of that day the guns and soldiers were engaged in clearing\r\nthe quarter of barricades, entanglements, and all. It was an easy task\r\nnow, though the firing was more violent than ever, as the progress\r\nwas more rapid. For the revolutionists had received orders from their\r\ncommittee that morning to abandon the street fighting and scatter to\r\ntheir homes or out into the country, continuing the propaganda and\r\nholding themselves ready for the next opportunity. Some escaped, at\r\nleast for the time. Some refused to obey, but continued the fighting,\r\nas we soon discovered. Many were seized, and for days afterwards small\r\nparties of soldiers or police in every street drove some unhappy\r\ncreature in front of them with his hands tied. What became of these\r\nprisoners, we only suspected at the time; we found out later. On this\r\npart of the Moscow rising, there is no more to chronicle but massacre.\r\nAnd so the barricades and their defenders faded into history, and law\r\nand order were restored.\r\n\r\nThat Thursday at noon, a decree went forth from Admiral Dubasoff\r\ncommanding all shutters to be taken down, all doors opened, and\r\nbusiness to be resumed on pain of martial law. Then the heart of the\r\nshopkeeper was glad. For eight days all shops had been shut; banks\r\nwere closed, merchants did no business, and, as the German song\r\nsays, no mill wheel turned around. It is always hard not to smile\r\nat the money-making classes whenever the great passions of human\r\nexistence appear upon the surface and shake their routine. Yet we\r\nneed not make light of their sufferings. They had suffered at the\r\nheart. For months past they had been deprived of the profit which\r\nis their single aim. For more than a week they had taken absolutely\r\nnothing, and the whole credit of the country was so shaken that they\r\ncould not hope for advance of capital. Their occupation was gone,\r\nand no return of it seemed likely. Besides the ordinary bankers,\r\nmerchants, and shopkeepers, we must include among them the hotel and\r\nrestaurant keepers, the theatrical managers, actresses, music-hall\r\npeople, prostitutes, and all such as live by pleasing or amusing the\r\nwealthy. We ought further to include artists, musicians, authors,\r\nlawyers, journalists, and professors, but as a rule their profits are\r\nso small that their losses would hardly count in the universal ruin.\r\nTo take a single instance of the immense injury to trade, the mere\r\ndamage to house property from the shells and bullets was estimated\r\nat £10,000,000, and all of it was dead loss, except to the builders\r\nand glaziers. The Sytin printing works, wantonly destroyed by the\r\nGovernment for printing the Liberal newspapers, was valued at £300,000.\r\nThere was no reason to be surprised, therefore, at the comfortable joy\r\nwhich welcomed the Government’s ruthless decree. Perhaps it might seem\r\na little indecent, while the dead who had fought for freedom were still\r\nlying in frozen layers at the police stations, or were being thrown\r\nneck-and-crop upon sledges for their unknown burial. But we must make\r\na large allowance for business habits, which tiresome revolutions\r\ninterrupt. Think of the feelings of our own City men if suddenly the\r\nmorning train which for years they had caught successfully, stopped\r\nrunning and shells rained from Holborn Viaduct to Aldgate Pump! With\r\nwhat common sense they would welcome the restoration of any tyranny,\r\nwith what scorn decry the fallen sentimentalists who had cared for\r\nfreedom! So in Moscow, returning law and order met a greasy smile, and\r\nmany extolled the Governor-General and officers for the vigour of their\r\naction. Skin for skin; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nSo “intercourse was resumed,” and the shop-keeping heart rejoiced.\r\nBut on Friday morning an uneasy feeling stole abroad that all was not\r\nquite satisfactory yet. About two miles west of the Kremlin there is an\r\nisolated manufacturing district called Presna or Presnensky. A little\r\nstream with two or three ponds, running from the back of the Zoological\r\ngardens into the Moscow river, separates it from the main town, and to\r\nthe north of it lies that ill-fated Khodinsky Polé, the plain where the\r\ncrowds were crushed to death at the Tsar’s coronation. The district is\r\nabout a mile square, and various factories stand there, for cotton,\r\nfurniture, varnish, boiler-making, and sugar. Some of them are under\r\nEnglish management, and in English commerce the place is known as Three\r\nHill Gates, because the country beyond gently rises into slopes that\r\nwould pass for hills in Russia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: “INTERCOURSE IS RESUMED.”\r\n\r\n   From _Streli_ (_Arrows_).]\r\n\r\nIt gradually became known that a large number of work-people--ten\r\nthousand of them it was said--were holding this district, and had set\r\nup there a little revolution of their own, under an organized system\r\nof sentries, pickets, and fighting force. A few students and educated\r\ngirls had come over to them from the revolutionists of the barricades\r\ndisguised as mill hands; indeed, a girl of eighteen was described\r\nas their most powerful leader, and in all probability those streets\r\nwhich I had seen barricaded on the extreme left of the Government\r\nadvance on the Wednesday, were blocked to give time for the Presnensky\r\npreparations. But in the main it was a work-people’s affair, and on the\r\nFriday they held undisturbed possession of the district, their sentries\r\nmarching up and down with revolvers and red flags, while they naïvely\r\nboasted themselves confident of terminating the exploitation of labour\r\nand establishing Social Democracy at a stroke.\r\n\r\nBut law and order were already at their work of disillusionment. That\r\nvery day the fashionable regiment of the Semenoffsky Guards, under\r\ncommand of Colonel Min, already notorious as a slaughterer of the\r\npeople, arrived from St. Petersburg, though the revolutionists made a\r\ngallant attempt to stop the railway by tearing up the lines. In the\r\nevening a cordon of troops was drawn round the district, and batteries\r\nwere placed on five positions, at ranges of 1000 to 2000 yards. One\r\nstood on a high bank near a bridge over the little stream I mentioned;\r\nanother was a point nearer the Zoo, where the gunners had to fight for\r\nthe position, and burnt down several rows of small houses; a third was\r\nin the cemetery, where they met with no opposition; a fourth far away\r\non the lowest slope of the Three Hills; and the fifth must have been\r\nstationed somewhere down by the Moscow river, but I did not discover it.\r\n\r\nThe district was thus surrounded by batteries, and at dawn on Saturday\r\nthe guns opened upon the mills and neighbouring houses. There were no\r\nguns to reply, and the gunners consequently made “excellent practice,”\r\nplumping their shells down where they liked, crashing through the\r\nwindows, or raising red clouds of brickdust from the battered walls.\r\nIt was about as leisurely and safe a piece of slaughter as ever was\r\nseen. The large furniture factory was soon alight, and burnt quickly\r\nto the ground. So did the fine house of its owner and manager, a\r\nGerman-Russian named Schmidt, who was justly suspected of holding\r\nLiberal opinions, and was afterwards shot for the crime. The Marmentoff\r\nvarnish works on the top of the hill also took fire, and its tanks\r\ncontinued to burn for many days and nights, rolling thick clouds of\r\nsmoke into the air all day, and casting a brilliant crimson light upon\r\nthe evening sky. The great Prokhoroffsky cotton mill was battered,\r\nand many shells burst in its rooms, but it was saved from fire by its\r\nautomatic “sprinklers,” which, however, ruined the machinery by rust.\r\nMany shells burst against the owner’s house on the hill, for he too had\r\ncommitted the sin of Liberalism. During the bombardment, his wife gave\r\nbirth to a child, an unpropitious time for herself and the nurses. But\r\nthe guns were chiefly directed against the large workmen’s barracks\r\nattached to the mills, and these were soon shattered, though they did\r\nnot burn. The small rows of cottages, where the married men lived with\r\ntheir families, being made of wood, blazed up at once, and it was in\r\nthem that most of the people were killed. At the time it was reported\r\nthat the gunners were ordered to fire on the lower stories, so that the\r\npeople upstairs might not escape. I doubt whether gunners could make\r\nthat distinction at the range, but, in any case, many people were cut\r\nto pieces by the segment shells and stifled by the flames. In one upper\r\nstory alone, nine old men and women, who had been collected there for\r\nsafety, were burnt to death.\r\n\r\nThe shelling was particularly heavy from eight to nine in the morning,\r\nand again from one to two. As the wooden houses caught fire, and the\r\nwork-people were driven out in helpless crowds from their barracks by\r\nthe crash of shells, the soldiers came crowding in with rifle and\r\nsword, and met with little organized resistance. The troops employed\r\nwere Cossacks, a Warsaw regiment, and the fashionable Semenoffsky\r\nGuards, who had arrived, as I noticed, only the day before, and to\r\nthe end of the insurrection displayed a surpassing blood-thirstiness\r\nand brutality. No Moscow men were present, though I was told by an\r\nofficer that the Rostoff regiment, which had been regarded as dubious\r\nfor some weeks past, entreated to be set in the front throughout the\r\nfighting, and at every chance engaged in the slaughter with a ferocity\r\nwell calculated to recover the Government’s esteem. The whole of that\r\nSaturday appears to have been one long massacre of men, women, and\r\nchildren, who were blown up, shot, and hewn in pieces with delightful\r\nease, and almost uninterrupted security. But that day I was myself\r\nunable to penetrate the thick line of sentries which surrounded the\r\ndistrict and were engaged in shooting down escaping refugees and\r\npreventing witnesses of the massacre from entering.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon an event happened which illustrates the spirit in\r\nwhich the Government’s agents carried out their work. Living in the\r\nPresnensky district, which has some streets of wealthy villas at the\r\nupper end, was a doctor named Vorobieff, well known in Russia as a man\r\nof science and a writer on medical discoveries. At the beginning of the\r\nbombardment he hung an ambulance flag from his window, to give notice\r\nto the wounded where they might obtain assistance. His landlord came\r\nand asked him to take it down, because the red cross would naturally\r\ndraw the fire of Government troops. He took it down, but continued\r\nattending to any wounded who came. Presently a party of police,\r\nunder an officer named Ermoleff, who had formerly been an officer in\r\nthe Guards cavalry, came to the house and accused him of assisting\r\nrevolutionists. He replied that he was not a revolutionist himself,\r\nbut it was his duty as a surgeon to give every possible help to the\r\nwounded, no matter what their opinions might be. “Have you a revolver?”\r\nErmoleff suddenly asked him. Yes, he said, he had a revolver, but he\r\nheld the Government licence for it. “Go and fetch your licence,” cried\r\nErmoleff. And as the doctor turned to go upstairs, he fired his pistol\r\ninto the back of his head and blew his brains out. “Oh, what have you\r\ndone?” cried his wife, who had been standing at the doctor’s side.\r\n“Hold your tongue, and wipe up that mess,” answered the ex-officer of\r\nthe Guards cavalry, and withdrew his party.[2]\r\n\r\nAll that night Moscow saw the flames raging to the sky. Many of the\r\nrevolutionists, and many of the ordinary work-people too, tried to\r\nescape from the district, especially across the frozen river, and it\r\nwas along the river banks that most of them were shot down. Early\r\nnext morning, on the excuse of visiting the English overseers who\r\nwere shut up in the district, I succeeded in penetrating the cordon\r\nof troops, though I was searched nine or ten times from head to foot,\r\nand the sledge was searched as well. Two Russian journalists from St.\r\nPetersburg, who tried to follow me, were less fortunate, for by the\r\ncommand of the officers, they were so shamefully beaten and stamped\r\nupon that they hardly escaped alive, and one of them, still exhausted\r\nwith terror and pain, came to my room some hours later to have his\r\nwounds dressed. All round the edge of the district, the wretched\r\nwork-people were now trying to escape to their villages upon any kind\r\nof sledge that would move. Into these sledges they had heaped all\r\ntheir household possessions--feather beds, furniture, cooking things,\r\nand heavy old trunks with clothes. Sometimes the toys already bought\r\nfor Christmas were laid carefully on the top--the doll or scarlet\r\nparrot--and one woman carried a baby on one arm and a wooden horse\r\nunder the other. But when it came to the line of pickets, every sledge\r\nwas emptied, all the boxes unpacked, and their contents strewn upon the\r\nsnow. The people also were searched with customary brutality--the old\r\npeople beaten, the young insulted. The soldiers thrust their hands into\r\nthe girls’ breasts and under their skirts. One girl was passed on from\r\nsoldier to soldier and searched six times within about twenty yards.\r\n“God spit at them!” muttered the women as they crawled away.\r\n\r\nThe guns were still in position around the district, and firing was\r\nto begin again in an hour. But on such mills as were still standing,\r\nthe white flag now waved. Arms were being surrendered, and the dead\r\nwere collected in rows upon the frozen surface of a pond. In one place\r\nwas a mutilated child of nine; in another a baby’s arm, cut off at\r\nthe shoulder and across the fingers, lay on the snow. For law and\r\norder were being restored. Near the mills I found many hundreds of\r\nwork-people standing idly round their ruined barracks and smouldering\r\nhomes. A barrack for mill-hands, as I have already shown, is not much\r\nof a place. The beds are jammed close together in rows; everything\r\nis hideous, the smell intolerable. Nor are the doghutch homes for\r\nmarried people much better. But at all events they had been warm. Now\r\nthe workmen and their families had nowhere to go, and for the last\r\nthree mornings the thermometer had stood at eighteen degrees below\r\nzero (Réaumur). Probably many homeless people were given shelter at\r\nnight in other crowded rooms, but all day long they remained shivering\r\nhelplessly among the ruins.\r\n\r\nI waited for some time in an English manager’s house, expecting the\r\nguns to re-open fire. But no firing came, though the guns remained\r\nall day in position. As far as open fighting went, the Moscow rising\r\nwas over. When I returned next morning (Monday, January 1st) I found\r\nthe guns had been withdrawn, and the streets and ruins and mills were\r\nheld by strong detachments of Cossacks and Guards. The surrender was\r\ncomplete. Three of the leaders had just been bayoneted to death,\r\nand their bodies were lying outside a shed. The remains of the last\r\nrevolutionary band were cooped up as prisoners in the sugar-mill yard,\r\nand soldiers stood round the thick crowd of them, while the leaders\r\nwere being sorted out for execution. Many women were found among them,\r\nand a large proportion of the dead were women too. Indeed, considering\r\nthat this was mainly a work-people’s movement, it was remarkable how\r\nlarge a part the women played.\r\n\r\nOf the killed it was impossible to form an accurate estimate. In the\r\nPresna district itself they said that eighty work-people were killed\r\nduring the bombardment of Saturday morning. Perhaps 200 were killed\r\nin all, including those who tried to escape across the river. As to\r\nthe larger question of the casualties during the whole ten days of\r\nthe rising, every kind of estimate was heard between 5000 and 20,000.\r\nI have even heard of enterprising newspapers which put the total\r\nof killed alone at 25,000. But it takes a lot of killing to make a\r\nthousand dead, and after going carefully into such figures as I could\r\nget with two experienced officials who knew the city well, it seemed\r\nto me probable that the killed numbered about 1,200, and the wounded\r\nperhaps ten times that amount. But the truth can never be accurately\r\nknown. The frozen bodies were piled up in police stations and other\r\nplaces till they could be carried out into the country by train and\r\nlaid in hasty trenches. When I was in St. Petersburg many weeks later,\r\na truck full of them arrived by mistake at the Moscow station there.\r\nThe authorities denied it, but no one doubted the truth.\r\n\r\nAfter our New Year’s Eve the process of vengeance and execution went on\r\nwithout further interruption. In the Presnensky district the prisoners\r\nwere usually shot in batches--sixteen, twenty, or even thirty-five\r\ntogether, as I was told by an overseer who lived close by and saw it\r\ndone. The work-people were set in a row before the firing party, and\r\nwere driven forward three at a time. Three by three they were shot down\r\nbefore the eyes of the others. The heap of dead increased. Three more\r\nwere driven forward to increase it, till at last only a heap of dead\r\nwas left. In the case of two workmen, suspected of being leaders, there\r\nwas a variety in the proceedings, perhaps by way of a practical joke.\r\nThey were ordered by the officer just to walk round a corner of the\r\nsugar mill. They went carelessly, with their hands in their pockets,\r\nand when they turned the corner they were faced by eight soldiers\r\nstanding at the present. In an instant they fell dead, and their bodies\r\nremained for a long time lying on the ground for all passers-by to see.\r\nSuch executions continued among these factories for more than a week,\r\nand the numbers of those poor and uneducated men and women who died for\r\ntheir protest against despotism will never be known.\r\n\r\nNor will the numbers of the victims within the city itself be known.\r\nAs I have said, on every street you met parties of soldiers and armed\r\npolice bringing them to the police-stations. Even at the beginning of\r\nthe rising, we have seen that prisoners were shot because the prisons\r\nwere too full to hold them. It is quite certain that they had no mercy\r\nnow, but what exactly became of them inside the walls, one could only\r\njudge from terrible hints and rumours that people whispered to each\r\nother. On the last day of the year, in a friend’s house, I met a\r\nskilled craftsman, an educated and middle-aged man, who from his own\r\nworkroom could reach a window overlooking a police-yard. There, he\r\nsaid, one could watch the prisoners brought in and briefly examined by\r\nan officer. They were then strapped to a board and beaten almost to\r\ndeath, and if they were people of no account they were handed over to\r\nthe executioners to be “broken up”--that is the English sportsman’s\r\nphrase for hares and foxes overtaken by the hounds. They were broken\r\nup. Their bones were smashed, their legs and arms lopped off with\r\nswords, and it did not take them very long to die.\r\n\r\nThe story may have been one of the exaggerations of war, but the man\r\nwas a quiet and ordinary citizen, with no reason for lying, and he\r\ninvited us quite freely to come and view the place, always soaked with\r\nblood. People of both parties who had lived many years in Moscow,\r\ndid not hesitate to believe it, and they often told me of things\r\nstill worse--of nameless things committed in the empty and windowless\r\nchambers of police-stations, where no light enters and no cry escapes.\r\n\r\nOne murder was especially talked about, because the victim happened to\r\nbe the son of a leading barrister, who was a friend of the Governor\r\nhimself. The boy was seized near the Riding School Barracks, close to\r\nthe university, either on suspicion or for open hostility. The Sumsky\r\nDragoons flogged him as usual, and their officer, finding him still\r\nalive, asked why they had not finished him off. An infantry officer\r\nwho was standing by, took the news to the father, and he appealed to\r\nthe Governor in person, asking only that the guard to take his son to\r\nprison should be composed of Moscow infantry and not of dragoons. The\r\nGovernor replied that of course his request should be granted, and\r\nevery consideration shown. Nevertheless, it was dragoons who formed\r\nthe guard, and the boy never reached the prison alive.\r\n\r\nRumours reached us also about the fate of the revolutionists who had\r\nwalked away into the country or afterwards escaped by train. I found\r\nsome of them as prisoners a few weeks afterwards, at a long distance\r\nfrom Moscow; but many were overtaken on the road or shot by soldiers\r\nat the stations. The Semenoffsky Guards especially distinguished\r\nthemselves by their zeal in hunting them down, and their exultation\r\nin the slaughter; but considerable allowance must be made for them,\r\nbecause they had not been given a chance of slaughtering the Japanese,\r\nand like all brave soldiers they naturally pined for active service.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DUBASOFF’S ROLL-CALL.\r\n\r\n   From _Burelom_ (_The Storm_).]\r\n\r\nSo much for the men and women who had dared to strike for liberty.\r\nBut having extinguished their efforts, Admiral Dubasoff devised a\r\nfurther method for discouraging the growth of Liberal opinions in the\r\nfuture--a method much applauded by the supporters of law and order, who\r\nhailed it as an admirable means of bringing ridicule upon the whole\r\nrevolutionary cause. He ordered the police to arrest all suspected boys\r\nand girls in the Moscow schools and bring them to the police-stations.\r\nThere they were handed over to soldiers, who stripped them, and, if\r\nthey were under fifteen, beat them with their hands. Between fifteen\r\nand eighteen, the girls and boys alike were stripped and beaten with\r\nrods, though the girls received only five strokes and the boys\r\ntwelve. I was told of this new device by reactionaries who had heard\r\nit from police-officers, knew of cases in which it had been carried\r\nout, and admired its admixture of sensuality with cruelty as likely\r\nto keep young people in their places for the future. But I could not\r\nhelp wondering how long a government in England would last if it handed\r\ngrown girls over to soldiers to be stripped and flogged because they\r\nwere suspected of Liberal opinions. I wondered also whether our own\r\npeople who were then beginning to ridicule the revolutionists, and\r\nto welcome the restoration of order, ever in the least realized what\r\nis meant by order under Russian rule. And I wondered most of all how\r\nFrenchmen could still be found to advance money for the support of such\r\na Government. But investors have neither pity nor shame.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these scenes came the Russian Christmas Day (January\r\n7th). It was celebrated as usual with superb ceremony in the enormous\r\nchurch of Christ the Saviour, which stands in the west of the city,\r\nabove the river. Soon after dawn the people began to assemble, and by\r\nten o’clock the vast space under the domes was packed with crowds,\r\nall standing up, except when, here and there, a man or woman forced\r\nthe neighbours to make room for prostration on the floor. Bodies of\r\ntroops stood at every corner round the building. The Governor-General\r\narrived, the military staff arrived, the scene was radiant with\r\nuniforms. In any case, the ceremony is half military, for the great\r\nchurch of Christ the Saviour was built to commemorate Napoleon’s\r\nretreat. But it was not of Napoleon that the heroes of massacre were\r\nthinking that day.\r\n\r\nThe service began. In the centre, under the dome, stood a\r\nbishop--perhaps an archbishop--with gleaming mitre, his robes stiff\r\nwith gold, his appealing arms supported by gorgeous priests. Between\r\nhim and the altar veiled books were carried to and fro, books were\r\nbrought with an escort of priests to be kissed, or were read in the\r\nunintelligible mutter of solemnity. Long-haired figures bore candles\r\nup and down; the bishop raised two candles high in air, crossing them\r\nso that they guttered down his robes, while he turned to the compass\r\npoints of the church, to bestow his blessing upon all. Old priests and\r\nyoung, glittering in the uniforms of holiness, came to kiss his hands.\r\nIn splendid humility he was supported to the altar. A veiled basin was\r\nbrought for him to wash in. A golden priest knelt with the sacred towel\r\nhanging round his neck. The bishop washed, and upon the golden priest’s\r\nneck he replaced the sacred towel. The Re-incarnation of Christ\r\nbegan. On each side of the altar a choir of boys and men, apparelled\r\nin scarlet and black and gold, raised the glory of Russian music in\r\nalternate chant. From arch to arch ran the gleam of the kindling\r\ntapers till the marble walls and gilded capitals shone with points of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nMuttering and sobbing with devotion, the masses of mankind swayed up\r\nand down, as they bowed and crossed themselves in the gloom below.\r\nStruggling to touch the polished pavement with their foreheads, they\r\nfell upon the ground. The boom of distant bells was heard; a small\r\nbell tinkled close at hand. In front of the altar stood a black-maned\r\npriest, and with uplifted arm and upturned face, he called upon Christ.\r\nHe called and called again, his immense voice bellowing round the\r\ncathedral, as though an organ had been wrought up to full power and one\r\ngreat note held firmly down. So he called upon Christ to come--Christ\r\nthe Saviour, Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting\r\nFather, the Prince of Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                           IN LITTLE RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure at Moscow fell like a blight upon all Russia, and hope\r\nwithered. The revolutionists, certainly, protested that much was\r\ngained. They admitted that they had allowed their hand to be forced by\r\nthe Government. The attempt, they knew, was ill-timed and ill-devised.\r\nBut they had not intended to win this time; the rising was only a\r\ndress rehearsal for the great revolution hereafter. They were teaching\r\nthe proletariat the methods of street fighting, and after all it was\r\nsomething to have held a large part of the ancient capital for ten days\r\nagainst the Government troops. Such a thing had never been accomplished\r\nbefore. They were proud of it, and when the hour of defeat came they\r\npointed to the high service which even reaction performed for the cause\r\nby combining all parties again in opposition to the common oppressor.\r\n\r\nOf these various pleas, the last alone could stand. The ferocity of the\r\nGovernment’s vengeance, the unscrupulous, disregard of all its pledges\r\nunder the reactionary terror, certainly obliterated the differences\r\nbetween the parties of progress, and smoothed away the growing enmities\r\nof rivals in their country’s salvation. Persecution is a powerful bond,\r\nand when all are gagged, silence passes for agreement. There need be\r\nno question that for the time the ruthlessness of the repression only\r\ninflamed the revolutionary spirit, and combined all sections against\r\nthe pitiless and incapable clique which was bringing ruin upon the\r\npeople. How far such a lesson might be permanent, how long such unity\r\nof purpose amid differences would be maintained when the pressure of\r\nadversity was removed, could only be known when the next opportunity\r\nfor revolution came. For the moment unity was gained.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the failure was only disastrous. It had proved too expensive\r\nfor a dress-rehearsal, and to fight for defeat is seldom worth the\r\npain. It deprived the movement of its prestige. The revolution was no\r\nlonger an unknown and incalculable power, springing from secret roots,\r\nno one knew where. The Government had gained all the advantages of a\r\ngeneral who has carried out a successful reconnaissance and discovered\r\nthe enemy’s limitations. They knew now on whom they could rely, and\r\nmany of the wealthy and educated classes who had rather enjoyed\r\nposing as Liberals when they thought it was the fashion, now began to\r\nappreciate the virtues of the ancient regime with fresh intelligence.\r\n\r\nOne thing, above all, the failure had proved: the devil was still on\r\nthe side of the big battalions. The real hope of the revolutionists\r\nhad been that the troops would come over to the side of freedom,--that\r\nthe soldiers would “fraternize.” They had some grounds for the hope.\r\nMutinies had been frequent and serious, the war scandals were partially\r\nknown throughout the army, the soldiers themselves sprang from the\r\npeople and would return to the people. It might be that they would\r\nhesitate to shoot men and women so like their own relations at home.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of revolutionary literature had been distributed\r\namong the garrisons, and many of the reservists had already professed\r\nSocialism. But when it came to action none of these things counted\r\nagainst the cowardice of obedience and the fear of death. It is true\r\nthat comparatively few of the garrison infantry were employed, though,\r\nas I have noticed, even the disaffected Rostoff regiment clamoured\r\nto be led to the front. But the gunners, who were supposed to be\r\nvery uncertain, were the chief instruments of suppression, and both\r\nthe dismounted Sumsky Dragoons and the Semeneffsky Guards, when they\r\narrived, displayed a bloodthirsty lust for massacre which could not\r\nhave been surpassed by the most loyal mercenaries.\r\n\r\nPut a man in uniform, feed him, give him arms, and he may generally\r\nbe depended upon to shoot as directed. Obedience is only a temptation\r\nto sloth, and it becomes almost irresistible when the temptation\r\nis supported by fear of death. The soldier who “fraternized”\r\nhad everything to lose, and the revolutionists could offer him\r\nnothing--nothing but a revolver, a dubious payment for three days\r\nwithout food or clothing, and a prospect of almost certain death\r\nif they failed. To win over an army, the revolutionists must first\r\ncommand a public purse. They must point to some Parliament, Assembly,\r\nCommittee--some authoritative body which can supply food, clothes,\r\nand pay. This was the advantage of our own Parliament in its struggle\r\nagainst despotism; it could draw upon legitimate taxes, the King\r\ncould only melt down plate. And under modern conditions, unless the\r\nrevolutionists can win over the army, a revolution by violence appears\r\nalmost impossible. That was why the immediate occasion of our own\r\nrevolution was the dispute between the King and Parliament about the\r\ncommand of the militia at Hull. Add to these instincts of obedience and\r\nself-preservation the promise of better food held out to the army in\r\nthe Tsar’s Christening-Day Manifesto; add the weariness and irritation\r\nof street fighting, the terror of sudden death lurking at every window,\r\nthe memory of women’s jibes and taunts during the past few weeks, and\r\nyou get a temper which will stick at no methods and be troubled by no\r\nremorse. Among poverty-stricken and uneducated men, with no employment\r\nor home or resources of their own, I doubt if enthusiasm for freedom\r\nshould ever be counted upon against the restraining powers of habit,\r\nuniform, and rations.\r\n\r\nThat was the main lesson of Moscow, and the Government was quick to\r\nlearn it. They knew their power depended entirely upon the command of\r\nthe army and police, but for the present that was secure. The command\r\nof the army and police depended again upon their ability to pay them,\r\nand, with an estimated deficit of £50,000,000 for the coming year and\r\na real deficit of about £80,000,000, finance was the weak point in the\r\nGovernment’s defences. But Kokovtsoff was now in Paris negotiating\r\na loan by which at least the French might pay their own interest on\r\ntheir own advances for one year, and for the future everything might\r\nbe hoped from the power of reaction. On January 9th, Witte replying\r\nto a deputation of the gently Conservative “League of October 30th,”\r\nannounced his conversion to violent and repressive measures with\r\ncharacteristic tearfulness. Whining like an apostate who blubbers over\r\nthe God he has betrayed, he cried--\r\n\r\n   “There was a time when I sought the confidence of the people,\r\n   but such illusions are no longer possible. I have always been\r\n   opposed to repression myself, but am now compelled to resort to\r\n   it, merely as the result of having trusted my countrymen.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus speaking, I myself was moving very slowly south-west\r\nfrom Moscow towards Kieff, over indistinguishable spaces of snow marked\r\nonly by rare and desolate villages of wooden huts and sheds. During the\r\ntwenty-eight hours of the journey, we passed a few miserable towns as\r\nwell, and on the side platforms of every station I noticed great piles\r\nof sacks sopping in the snow and rain; for a premature thaw had set in\r\nand there was hardly a shred of tarpaulin to cover them. I found out\r\nafterwards that these sacks held the last summer’s harvest--the grain\r\nwhich ought to have been feeding Russia and Europe. But it lay rotting\r\nthere while peasants starved, because the thousand trucks which should\r\nhave taken it to market were standing idle in Siberia or dragging men\r\nand horses slowly home, and the Government which had made war upon\r\nJapan was now entirely occupied in flogging or shooting the men and\r\nwomen who differed from their policy.\r\n\r\nKieff, like Moscow and other towns, was exposed to all the violence\r\nof martial law, which, indeed, for various reasons had become almost\r\nchronic there. The city has often shown herself the birthplace of\r\nrevolution, and she is kept in almost continual ferment by the\r\nopposition between her piety and her intellect. She boasts herself the\r\nancient centre of Russian religion and, at the same time, of Russian\r\nthought--a strange combination, but that the religion is mainly\r\nsubterranean and the thought dwells in the upper air. As objects of\r\npilgrimage her holy shrines are unrivalled. Peasants from all over\r\nRussia visit Kieff by hundreds of thousands a year. They come to pray\r\nat the ancient church of St. Sophia--a circle of dark and unexpected\r\nchapels clustering round a central dome, where mosaics on golden\r\nground dimly gleam to the few tapers below, but all else is dark, and\r\ninvisible forms are heard moving in shadow, as a priest intones, or an\r\noutburst of deep chanting sounds from unseen altars. But most pilgrims\r\nare more attracted by the mummied forms of Russian saints who lie at\r\nrest in catacombs far underground, below the churches and monasteries\r\nof the sacred Lavra hill, which looks across the Dnieper to the great\r\nplain of unenclosed fields and forests beyond. With coffin lids open\r\nto preclude deception, the saints are laid in the rock-cut passage or\r\nniche where once they spent their dull years of suffering because the\r\ntorments of ordinary life upon the surface were insufficient for their\r\nzeal. Nay, one who, regardless of health, lived buried in earth to his\r\nshoulders for thirty years, stands buried so still. The rest lie wrapt\r\nin coloured cloth through which their face and form may only obscurely\r\nbe discerned; but when I examined the cloth I found it genuine. Year\r\nafter year their holy shrines are watched by silent monks, who sit\r\nbeside them with lighted tapers, religiously idle, while the long files\r\nof peasants pass and give their pence, and kiss the cotton coverings,\r\nand gulp the holy water which as a final blessing is presented them\r\nto drink from the hollow of a silver cross. Or if any one refuses to\r\ndrink, the monk pours the water down his back, in the hope that even\r\nupon a heretic the efficacy of so great a blessing may not be entirely\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nBut above ground, Kieff is the mother of science and intellectual\r\nprogress, as far as such things can exist in Russia at all. Upon\r\nthe surface of her pretty hills, stand a famous University, a great\r\nPolytechnic, and many schools. Ever since the fourteenth century, when\r\nthere was no such great distinction between divine and human knowledge,\r\nKieff has been conspicuous for her learning, and she still claims\r\nequal rank with Moscow and St. Petersburg. Hers was the first printing\r\npress of Russia, and it is she who has provided the training for most\r\nof Russia’s recent politicians up to Witte himself--politicians as\r\ndistinct from officials, who are produced according to regulation type\r\nby the more passive and unimaginative races of other districts. For\r\nKieff is the real capital of Little Russia, and the Little Russians\r\nhave no doubt that they are the intellectual people. They call\r\nthemselves the Midi of Russia, the Provençals, the people of the sunny\r\nsouth. They are Slavs themselves, but they claim the Slavs of Galicia\r\nor such Slavs as are found in Prague as their nearest relations, and\r\nthough their language is only a Slavonic dialect, it is unintelligible\r\nto other Russians, and is a bond of union only among the dwellers in\r\nthe Ukraine or marches or borderland of the south-west.\r\n\r\nEven in winter the dress of Little Russian peasants is brilliant and\r\ndistinctive. They go in cheerful crimson and orange, and their skirts\r\nand aprons are worked with barbaric embroidery, as among the Bulgarian\r\nSlavs of Macedonia. Their music and dances are like no other in Russia,\r\nbeing comparatively gay. The artistic instincts run in their blood,\r\nand the women supply the Empire with singers, actresses, dancers, and\r\nothers among whom beauty counts for wealth. In ordinary life even a\r\nstranger notices at once that the people are better mannered and more\r\ncheerful, though that does not imply an unseemly excess of merriment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A LITTLE RUSSIAN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A TRAMP.]\r\n\r\nIn language, in life, and in temperament the distinction is almost\r\nas much marked as between two kindred but separate races, but among\r\nthe Little Russians there is no proposal of separation. They would\r\ngladly become a home-ruled State in a Russian Confederacy, provided\r\ntheir defence were insured and they suffered no commercial loss. But\r\ntheir great fear is not of Russia but of Poland, lest any marked\r\nimprovement in their position should bring more Poles among them to\r\nswallow them up. Already the Poles are gathering the commerce and land\r\ninto their hands, and Poles are regarded much like the Jews, as\r\ninsinuating people, unscrupulous, and horribly clever. Little Russia\r\nis apprehensive of Poland very much in the same way as Poland is\r\napprehensive of Germany. Worse than all, the Poles are Catholic and\r\ncare nothing for Theodosius and Nestor and the eighty mummied saints\r\nof Kieff. The Little Russian knows of only two religions beside his\r\nown--the “Old Believers,” who in spite of all the death and torture\r\nthey have suffered for two centuries and have so richly deserved for\r\nholding up a heretical number of fingers in the blessing, still remain\r\nin the family of the Church, as the poor relations of Orthodoxy; but,\r\napart from them, he only knows “the Polish,” by which he means the\r\nCatholic--schismatics hardly removed from heathendom, who worship\r\nimages instead of pictures, and keep their Easter wrong, and do not\r\ncompel their priests to marry, but are predestined to eternal fire.\r\n\r\nAs it is, the Polish element is very strong in Little Russia, and so\r\nis the German, the Bohemian, and the Galician. For Kieff has been the\r\ngreat centre of international intercourse during the last fifty years,\r\never since an English engineer, with English workmen, and English\r\nmaterials, threw a suspension bridge over the wide stream of the\r\nDnieper there, and placed it on the great high-road of South Russia.\r\nThe bridge was lately reconstructed, and it is a sign of change that a\r\nRussian engineer was now employed, with Russian workmen, and Russian\r\nmaterials, and still it stands. But the result of all this admixture\r\nin Kieff has been that the Little Russian movement is disappearing\r\nbefore the general longing for great constitutional changes throughout\r\nthe Empire. For themselves, the Little Russians would be well content\r\nif they were allowed the free use of their language, which is now\r\nforbidden both in print and on the stage, while a Little Russian\r\nnewspaper which ventured to peep out after the October Manifesto was at\r\nonce stamped upon. But for the larger aspects of progress, Kieff has\r\nnever failed to supply revolutionists alike eloquent and daring.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in the city the surface looked quiet enough, though\r\nmartial law still prevailed. Some ten weeks had passed since the\r\nLoyalists or the Black Hundred, directed by the police, protected\r\nby the soldiers, and bearing crosses and portraits of the Tsar in\r\nprocession, had sacked and plundered down the main street; while in\r\nfront of the Town Hall a military band played the national anthem to\r\nenliven their patriotism. On that occasion the Liberals were saved\r\nby the riches of the Jews, for the patriots preferred free and easy\r\nplunder to risky assassination. So the Cossacks who were ordered out\r\nto suppress the tumult, ranged up their horses in front of the Jewish\r\nshops, and took heavy toll of the plunder as the thieves came out\r\nthrough the line with their loads. The police and hotel-keepers took\r\ntoll in the same way; indeed, the proprietor of the best hotel in the\r\ntown accumulated so valuable a reward from the neighbouring jewellers’\r\nshops that even patriots regarded his patriotism as overstepping the\r\nrequirements of citizenship and good taste.\r\n\r\nThat day the blessings of this world were very widely distributed in\r\nKieff, but it happened that almost the only non-Jewish house attacked\r\nwas the British Consulate. Outside this house, which stands within\r\nforty yards of the main street, and bears over its door the usual\r\npainted placard of the British arms, a garrison officer formed up his\r\ncompany in a half-circle, and ordered them to pour volleys into the\r\nwindows. Apparently he acted out of mere national spite, or perhaps\r\nbecause England, in spite of all the errors of the last ten years,\r\nis still regarded by the Russian revolutionists as “the Holyland of\r\nFreedom.” Happily, the British Consul himself had just left the place,\r\nbeing engaged in a gallant attempt to save the lives of a Jewish family\r\nby sheltering them in his own private residence. A formal apology was\r\nafterwards made by the Governor-General of the town, and the incident\r\nwas officially declared “closed.” But English people who are inclined\r\nto trust the forces of law and order rather than the Russian Liberals,\r\nfor the protection of our consulates and our interests, should consider\r\nits significance. It was more shameless than the attack upon our\r\nConsul at Warsaw on January 31st of the same year, though it did not\r\nattract so much attention.\r\n\r\nThroughout the winter, the sufferers who had been ruined by the\r\nLoyalist demonstration kept putting in claims for redress, which the\r\nRussian Government politely answered by assuring them that they were\r\nat perfect liberty to prosecute those who had done the damage in the\r\nusual law-courts. The day I arrived in Kieff, a very large number of\r\nJews--said to be three hundred--were suddenly arrested at a religious\r\nservice, no reason being given. Two days later they were suddenly\r\nreleased, no one knew why. These are but instances of the kind of\r\njustice which the revolutionists think they could improve upon without\r\nupsetting the foundations of society.\r\n\r\nAlso on the same day on which I arrived, a band of thirty-five\r\nrevolutionists who had escaped from Moscow and had crept down the\r\nrailway as far as this, with a view perhaps to escaping by way of\r\nOdessa or Poland, were arrested at the station. They disappeared, and\r\nit was universally assumed that they were shot at once, if only because\r\nthe prisons were so horribly full that no one else could possibly be\r\nstowed into them. After the first railway strike in October, a deadly\r\nform of typhus, or gaol fever, broke out in the prisons. The relatives\r\nof the imprisoned railway men offered to nurse their own friends,\r\nand be responsible for them, if only they might be released from the\r\nplague-stricken gaols. But the request was refused, and the men left\r\nto rot. Next came the serious military rising of December, the chief\r\ndemand of the soldiers being for more decent treatment from their\r\nofficers. The mutiny was rapidly suppressed, and the published figures\r\nof the men who disappeared in consequence were given at ninety, but I\r\ndiscovered that among the officers themselves the acknowledged numbers\r\nwere three hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\nBut beside its distinction for religion, intellect, and revolution,\r\nKieff is also famous as the capital and market for the land of “Black\r\nEarth” that great deposit of fertile soil which supplies wheat for\r\nEngland and most of Europe, and is the chief source of such little\r\nwealth as Russia possesses. In 1904, Russia’s total exports were valued\r\nat £96,000,000. To this amount the foodstuffs contributed £61,400,000,\r\nand the value of exported grain alone was £49,530,000, of which England\r\ntook £6,370,000. Next to grain in value came naphtha, which amounted\r\nonly to £5,823,200, and, only a little below that, eggs. Rather more\r\nthan half the total of Russia’s exports, therefore, consists of grain,\r\nand this Black Earth is the granary of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom Kieff I made a long journey by sledge to many villages about\r\nthirty or forty miles away.\r\n\r\nFor a time the frost had broken up, though the Russian New Year had\r\nonly just begun. Consequently the tracks were hardly passable for the\r\nrough wooden sledges that peasants use, and at one place where the\r\nsnow was falling in great sheets, driven by the wind, so that the wide\r\nsteppe showed no marks on its whiteness, and no division was to be seen\r\nbetween sky and land, our progress was very difficult for many hours.\r\nBut we reached a village at last, and there, as in all the others I\r\nvisited, I was surprised to find, not higher prosperity, but worse\r\npoverty than in the Great Russian villages I had seen. In one cottage,\r\nit is true, three dogs, two cows, a bristly pig, and a cat were all\r\nnestling against the stove in the entrance-room or antechamber. The\r\ndwelling-room also had one real iron bedstead, a chest of clothes, and\r\na whole row of glittering icons. I hoped it was typical of the village,\r\nbut I was wrong. It must have belonged to the village moneylender.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A PEASANT’S HOME.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE LAVRA AT KIEFF.]\r\n\r\nThe other houses were rather singularly wretched. The very next was\r\ninhabited by a family who cultivated their own plot of land close\r\naround the cottage. The man had gone, like all the other men of the\r\nplace, to wait his turn in the string of pleasure-seekers outside the\r\nGovernment vodka-shop and purchase the New Year’s joy; but the wife\r\nand three children were at home, all seated on the broad shelf which\r\nmade the second-best bed. The other bed was a warm space constructed\r\non the top of the great brick stove itself. There was no covering of\r\nany kind on either bed, and, of course, no mattress; nor was there any\r\nfurniture in the room, not even a table, chair, or chest. The family\r\nhad their meals on the bed, and the only decoration was a row of brown\r\nearthenware plates which the woman had stuck against a wall, just as\r\nthough she had been dwelling in the Kensington of twenty years ago.\r\n“They look so red,” she said, “red” being the common Russian word for\r\nbright or pretty or even splendid, as I noticed in the case of the\r\nKrasnaya Square in Moscow. As in all the villages of this district, the\r\noven was heated only by straw, for coal is unheard of, and wood too\r\nexpensive to buy. Only a few hours earlier I had driven through far the\r\nbiggest pine forest I had then seen in Russia--great woods of spruce\r\nand Scotch fir. But all those forests belonged to the Tsar, and no\r\npeasant dared to touch a twig of them. To be found burning wood might\r\ncost a man his cottage and land. So the stove that keeps the family and\r\ncottage alive is heated with straw.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for the permanent poverty in this rich\r\nland--the taxes, the extortions of the moneylender, the ignorance of\r\nagriculture, the oppression of the petty officials. But the ultimate\r\nreason is that when serfdom was nominally abolished, and the land\r\nnominally distributed, forty years ago, there were far more peasants\r\nin proportion on the Black Earth than on the unfertile land of other\r\nparts, so that the grants were very small--so small that the greater\r\nfertility could not make up for the difference--and the price affixed\r\nto each grant was not merely too large, it was so overwhelming that the\r\npeasants were never able to wipe out the debt, and their payments in\r\nfact became a fixed rent to Government, and a much higher rent than in\r\nother districts.\r\n\r\nSo far, all around Kieff, the peasants had remained quiet. No\r\ncountry houses had been burnt or proprietors killed, though the\r\nusual superstition about the danger of venturing out into the\r\ncountry prevailed. The people, as I have said, are a sanguine and\r\nhappy-tempered race, as Russians go. Regiments of soldiers had also\r\nbeen distributed among their villages as a further inducement for\r\nkeeping the peace. In the little country town of Vasilikoff, among\r\nits low hills and wintry orchards, I found the Kieff dragoons, for\r\ninstance, engaged in spreading contentment among the peasants by\r\nshowing themselves human to the girls. As I watched them strolling\r\nabout the filthy lanes of that remote and wintry place, prodding the\r\nrough cattle, criticizing the ponies in the street-market, or carrying\r\naway the steaming cauldrons of tea for rations, I remembered with a\r\nstrange sense of distance that the English King was this regiment’s\r\nhonorary colonel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                          THE JEWS OF ODESSA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Odessa, after travelling over the peculiarly desolate\r\nsteppe from Kieff, only about eleven weeks had passed since she\r\ncelebrated an amazing festival of liberty. Her straight streets had\r\nlaughed for joy, and the old Black Sea had reflected the smile. Youths\r\nparaded with flags and trumpets, aged professors embraced in tears,\r\nand women, as on a Russian Easter Day, felt hurt if they were not\r\nkissed--all because the Tsar had issued a manifesto and freedom had\r\nrisen into life. The long struggle was surely near its end, and those\r\nwho had fallen for the cause had not died in vain.\r\n\r\nTwo days later they buried freedom, and whilst I was there the\r\nGovernment was still busy stamping down the bloody earth to lay her\r\nghost. There was no longer any talk of manifesto or concession. Every\r\npromise had been falsified, and every hope deceived. No meetings were\r\nallowed, except to legal Hooligans. No papers could appear, except the\r\nGovernment organ of violence. Even the paper of the Constitutional\r\nDemocrats had been suddenly suppressed. The friends of liberty choked\r\nthe prisons, and as I went down the streets I saw their white faces\r\npeering between the bars. All was still, except when the stagnation of\r\ntyranny was broken by the murder of some police-officer conspicuous for\r\nbrutality, or by a bomb such as had just fallen into the Café Liebmann\r\non the central square by the cathedral. No schools had been open since\r\nOctober, and there seemed no prospect of the University ever opening\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTrepoff began it when he sent an order from St. Petersburg urging the\r\nGovernor-General Neidhart to allow a demonstration of the loyalist\r\nBlack Hundred on November 1st. Infuriated by religious conviction and\r\nthe lust for stolen goods, the Black Hundred exhibited an enthusiastic\r\nloyalty, unchecked by the police, who directed their movements, or by\r\nthe troops, who were confined to barracks. For three days the city\r\nlay at the mercy of law and order, and in the cemetery may be seen\r\nthe oblong of loose earth where 350 bodies were heaped into a common\r\ngrave. The Government’s victory was complete and so far-reaching that\r\nmemorials of it might still be seen on every side. Even in the middle\r\nof the town, shops that had been the richest had the shutters up in\r\nJanuary, their windows were broken to pieces, their stores all gone.\r\nAnd in the northern and north-west districts, where the Jews and\r\nsome work-people live, whole rows of houses stood desolate. The marks\r\nof bullets were thick upon the walls. The empty sockets of the windows\r\nwere roughly boarded over. The roofs had been broken in or sometimes\r\nburnt away, and even on the main streets people pointed out the\r\nwindows, three storeys high, from which babies, girls, and women had\r\nbeen pitched sheer upon the stony pavement below.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE JEWS’ GRAVE AT ODESSA.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AFTER THE MASSACRE.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the miserable lanes of this north-west district that the\r\nplunder and slaughtering began--a district so wretched that my\r\ntop-boots kept sticking in the deep slough of the streets, and the\r\nworst Jewish slum off Commercial Road would have seemed in comparison a\r\nCounty Council paradise. But passing beyond this quarter, I crossed a\r\ndeep watercourse, and came out upon the kind of land which serves for\r\ncountry at the backdoor of Odessa. It is part of the wild and almost\r\nuninhabited steppe which stretches for mile on mile round the basin of\r\nthe Dniester and far away into Bessarabia--an uninterrupted, water-worn\r\nplain, like the Orange River veldt, but streaked at that time with\r\nmelting snow. On the edge of this steppe stands a semi-detached town or\r\nlarge village, called Slobodka Romanovka, conspicuous for its madhouse\r\nand its hospital. Providence itself must have ordained the site of\r\nthese buildings, for nowhere else upon earth’s surface could they have\r\nbeen more wanted. And, indeed, it was the Chosen People of Providence\r\nwho wanted them most, for none of the rabid Christians who there hunted\r\nthem down were afterwards confined in the asylum for mania.\r\n\r\nThe village numbered about 26,000 souls, and there was hardly a house\r\nwhich did not still show the marks of wrecking and murder. Clubs\r\nwere the weapons chiefly used by the champions of Christ and the\r\nTsar--such clubs as the Turks used in Constantinople when they brained\r\nthe Armenians in the name of the Prophet and the Sultan. But long\r\nbutcher knives were found even more convenient for killing children,\r\nand when there was the least show of resistance, nothing could be more\r\nserviceable than a revolver at five yards’ range. In that three days’\r\nmassacre nearly all who suffered were Jews, and out of a population of\r\nabout 600,000 in Odessa, the Jews are estimated at a little under or a\r\nlittle over 300,000, so that the game for the Christian sportsmen lay\r\nthick upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Odessa are said by their Christian neighbours--even by such\r\nas restrained themselves from putting them to death--to represent a\r\nparticularly unpleasant type. They are accused of peculiar selfishness,\r\ngreediness, and indifference to suffering, even to their own. I\r\ncannot say for certain whether that is so. I only know that they have\r\na particularly unpleasant time, and, whether indifferent to their\r\nown sufferings or not, they are an amazing people. Their Christian\r\nneighbours, as in Kieff and all centres of Jewish persecution, chalk\r\na conspicuous cross on their shutters in dangerous times, or stick a\r\nsixpenny saint’s portrait over the door. Most people also, as I noticed\r\nin Moscow, wear big crosses hidden round their necks, so that, when\r\nthe supporters of the Government are out cutting throats, they may\r\nhave some chance of salvation. No Jew would do any such thing--not for\r\ndear life itself would he do it. Christians say he could not conceal\r\nhimself, even if he wished--his look, his dwelling, his passport, the\r\npolice, all would betray him. And no doubt that is true, though, if I\r\nwere a Jew, I would cover my house with crosses from ground to roof\r\nin the hope of saving any one I cared for from being flung out of my\r\ntop window. But, even if such hope were vain, that is no reason why a\r\nJew should cover his outside shutters and the lintel of his door with\r\nHebrew inscriptions or Hebrew information about his Kosher goods and\r\nthe Shomer who is in attendance. Yet on ruin after ruin I saw these\r\ninscriptions written; and, what is more remarkable, I saw the surviving\r\nowners repainting these inscriptions as they patched up the wreckage of\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nThey are not, perhaps, exactly the race I should call chosen, but\r\ncertainly they are a peculiar people. I saw, for instance, one aged\r\ntype of wretched Israel who had been counted a prosperous man, but\r\nin the massacre had lost wife, family, ducats, and all. When his seed\r\nwas buried and the days of the mourning passed, he borrowed a few\r\ncigarettes, and sat down on the pavement outside the wilderness of his\r\nhabitation. Next day he had more cigarettes to sell. Next week he had\r\na stall, and when I saw him he was hoping to open a tobacconist shop\r\nwhere before he sold secondhand clothes and saw his family murdered. It\r\nseems impossible that all the Christians in Russia, backed as they are\r\nby the open support of the army, police, and Church, can ever succeed\r\nin exterminating such a race.\r\n\r\nBut for the time their misery was extreme. They had crowded for refuge\r\ninto courts which ran far back from the ordinary streets--something\r\nlike the old “rents” in Holborn. There I found them living in stinking\r\nand steaming rooms or cellars, and often I had to grow accustomed to\r\nthe darkness before I could discern exactly how many families were\r\naccommodated in the corners. The assistant of one of the University\r\nprofessors was my guide, for a certain amount of relief work was being\r\ncarried on by such Liberals as happened to be still out of gaol. I was\r\ntold the town had already spent £15,000 in relief, and the Zemstvo\r\nhad voted as much again to keep the distressed alive till the end of\r\nApril. I dimly heard, also, of a fund contributed by Jews in England,\r\nbut I did not discover their methods. As to the town fund, I could not\r\nbe certain how much of it reached the Jews, but some did, for with an\r\nagent I visited one of the ten “sanitary districts” into which the town\r\nhad been divided, and saw how he dealt with the cases.\r\n\r\nMoney had been given at first, but, as usual, imposture came, and the\r\nprofessors had found themselves no match for a race whose whole weekday\r\nexistence is devoted to gathering where they have not strown. Later on,\r\nthe town bound itself only to feed the destitute by a system of free\r\ntickets, or at a very small charge. It was the ordinary soup-kitchen\r\nmethod--not scientific, not inhumanly discriminating; but Russia has\r\nthe happiness of being young in philanthropy, as in politics, and has\r\nnot yet developed the caution of our charity societies, which in their\r\nstrained quality are so little like mercy. As was to be expected,\r\ncrowds of the unemployed came wandering in from other towns, even as\r\nfar away as Kharkoff and Kieff; and under the passport system most\r\nof them were routed out and sent back again. What was worse, some\r\n15,000 men and women had lately been turned upon the streets because\r\nthe rich people of Odessa, who live in the pleasant quarter by the\r\ncliffs overlooking the sea, began to run for their lives that day in\r\nJune when the mutinous warship _Potemkin_ made them all jump by\r\nthrowing two shells into the town near the cathedral; and they had\r\nbeen running ever since. Behind them they left all that host of valets,\r\ncooks, nurses, housemaids, grooms, coachmen, gardeners, boot-boys,\r\nbarbers, and washerwomen who depend on the rich for existence, just as\r\nthe rich depend on them. The shopkeepers who sell the things that only\r\nrich people can buy suffered equally, and many of their assistants were\r\ndismissed. It is bad for all when, according to the old parable, the\r\nmembers refuse to feed the belly, and it is worse when the belly runs\r\naway from the members. But if any one supposes on that account that the\r\nexpenditure of the rich confers an inestimable benefit upon the working\r\nclasses, he is involved in a very comfortable old fallacy.\r\n\r\nBeside all this, there was great distress among the dockers, in spite\r\nof the considerable share of Jewish wealth which they had obtained in\r\ntheir outburst of religious and patriotic zeal. Most of it went in an\r\nimmense drinking debauch to celebrate the victory over the enemies of\r\nChrist, and work had ceased because the great fire during the mutiny\r\nin June destroyed a great part of the docks, and entirely burnt away\r\nthe wooden viaduct upon which the dock railway runs along the whole\r\nface of the port. One day when I was there, trial trains began to run\r\nfor the first time, amid such popular excitement that I hoped another\r\nmutiny had broken out. But no warships were any longer stationed in\r\nthe port, except one little destroyer. The dockers were only excited\r\nat the prospect of regular work. They live by themselves at the foot of\r\nthe cliffs, below the fashionable boulevard, and they are said to be\r\nin every way a race apart. Certainly they adopt a distinctive costume,\r\nmore astonishing in its incongruity than a West Coast chiefs, and\r\nsuggesting a burlesque air of intentional raggedness, like an amateur\r\nwho wants to look Bohemian. The dockers, however, have no need for\r\ndeliberation in picturesque poverty, for the average wages of unskilled\r\nlabour through the city is 1_s._ 8_d._ for a day of ten hours, or\r\n2_d._ an hour. And it is not as though 2_d._ in Russia went as far as\r\nthe “honest tanner” for which our own dockers struggled so hard in\r\nthe early nineties. Ordinary living is very expensive in Odessa, more\r\nexpensive even than in most Russian cities, and in an earlier chapter\r\nI noticed how strangely high the cost of living is in St. Petersburg\r\nand Moscow, chiefly owing to the heavy rent charges, in spite of the\r\nvast extent of unfilled and unoccupied land in the Empire. Except for\r\nthe hire of street sledges and little open cabs, two shillings in\r\nRussia do not go much further than one in London, nor twopence to an\r\nOdessa docker much further than a penny in Poplar. No one can dress\r\nvery sumptuously when he has to feed himself and family on a penny an\r\nhour, and we cannot wonder that the unskilled join the party of law and\r\norder, in the hope that an occasional massacre will bring a change of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nIn politics, Odessa included all the Russian parties, from the rival\r\npioneers of Social Revolution and Social Democracy (most of whom were\r\nin gaol) down to the “Russian Order,” or party of violence, which is\r\nthe Government’s ready instrument for the destruction of Jews, Poles,\r\nLiberals, and other heretics. The Russian Order alone was still allowed\r\nto hold meetings, every other party organization being forbidden by\r\nthe police. But, nevertheless, it was in Odessa that I first became\r\nintimate with the Constitutional Democratic party, which has since\r\ngrown to such importance as a possible instrument for reform. They were\r\nespecially strong in the University, which justly prides itself on its\r\npolitical fearlessness. Their newspapers and all meetings had been\r\nsuppressed; but most of the Professors and other leaders were still at\r\nlarge, though daily awaiting arrest, with enviable unconcern.\r\n\r\nThey were energetically preparing the first grade of elections for\r\nthe Duma, and they expected to secure a majority upon the body, who\r\nin turn would select the single representative appointed for the\r\ngreat city in the Duma. Like other Progressive parties, they demanded\r\na Constituent Assembly under the four-headed suffrage (universal,\r\ndirect, secret, and equal). Their programme included Home Rule for\r\nthe various nationalities of the Empire, labour legislation, and a\r\nsweeping agrarian reform on the basis of compensation for private land,\r\nbut not for the Crown lands held by the Imperial family. In fact,\r\ntheir immediate objects, as the Professors admitted, were hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from the “minimum programme” of the Social Democrats.\r\nBut when we began to talk about “immediate objects” and “minimum\r\nprogrammes,” I remembered that seven weeks had gone by since such\r\nconversations seemed natural--seven weeks of bloodshed and suppression\r\nand bitter change. They themselves took the mournful difference very\r\ncalmly. The fight was still in front of them, every hope had been\r\ncrushed, every effort for freedom would have to begin again from the\r\nvery start. But nothing discouraged them; the mere struggle was worth\r\nthe pains; and to this patient people even the bitterest and most cruel\r\nexperience never ceases to work hope.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the Jewish question is the centre of political interest\r\nin Odessa, and, in spite of all suppression, the Jewish “Bund” is\r\nlikely to remain the most powerful progressive organization as long\r\nas the Jews continue subject to their hereditary wrongs. Under laws\r\nwhich were called temporary, but have continued unrepealed for fifty\r\nyears, no Jew may buy land or rent it. He may not live out in the\r\ncountry, and only in certain quarters of the towns. He may not be a\r\nschoolmaster or professor. He may not teach in private Christian\r\nfamilies. He may not be educated at a high school (gymnasium) or at\r\na University, except at a very low percentage of the whole number\r\nof students. Usually it is not higher than three to five per cent.,\r\nthough in Odessa the Professors, being exceptionally Liberal, had on\r\ntheir own authority extended the number to ten per cent., and were on\r\nthe point of declaring the University open on level terms to Jew and\r\nChristian alike, when the University was suddenly shut on level terms\r\nto all. A Jew may not sit on the Zemstvo or Town Council; he may not\r\nbe an officer in the army or navy; he may hold no State appointment;\r\nand he must not move from place to place without special permission\r\nand a special form of passport, like the prostitutes. Jews are not by\r\nnature a revolutionary people. The rigid Conservatism of their customs\r\nand ritual, as well as their intense pre-occupation in material gain,\r\ndeters them from violence and change. Their peculiar dangers lie in\r\nexactly the opposite direction--in disregard of the large issues before\r\nmankind, and in a narrow devotion to antiquated ideals. But we cannot\r\nwonder that in Odessa, as in Russia generally, they are revolutionists\r\nalmost to a man, and that to the ordinary Russian official or soldier a\r\nJew of the “Bund” is identical with the “Anarchist”--a creature to be\r\nshot as quickly as convenient. When I was in Odessa I first heard how\r\nthe new Aliens Act was being put into operation in England, and as I\r\nread of Jewish refugees cast back from the ancient protection of our\r\ncountry to the misery and bloodshed from which they believed they had\r\nescaped, I thought of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                           LIBERTY IN PRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn St. Petersburg the successors of the original Strike Committee had\r\ndeclared the general strike at an end, on January 1st. The thing had\r\nnot been a success. Either because the leaders were in prison, or that\r\nthe work-people were harassed by the frequent repetition of strikes\r\nwhen funds were low, only about 20,000 remained away from work, and\r\nmost of these were locked-out by the employers. Outwardly, the city\r\ncontinued quiet, in spite of the deep indignation excited by the arrest\r\nof all the popular leaders and editors, and afterwards by the murder of\r\na musical student named Davidoff, who was shot by Okounoff, an officer\r\nof the Guards, for keeping one foot on a chair while the National\r\nAnthem was being played in a restaurant on the Russian New Year’s Eve\r\n(January 13th).\r\n\r\nThen came the first anniversary of Vladimir’s Day or Bloody Sunday\r\n(January 22nd). The city was filled with troops. All the previous\r\nnight cavalry patrols went up and down the streets, and on going into\r\nthe large courtyards, round which most of the dwelling-houses are\r\narranged, I found many of them full of soldiers, sitting round fires\r\nwith piled arms. Guns were concealed at convenient points, and all\r\npreparations laid for repeating the massacre of the previous year. But\r\nthe Strike Committee had issued an appeal calling upon the workmen to\r\nobserve the day only by quitting the factories, staying at home, and\r\ndrawing down the blinds;[3] and though, in answer to this, the masters\r\nplacarded a notice threatening with dismissal any one who remained\r\naway from work, the Strike Committee still had power enough to ordain\r\na passive resistance.\r\n\r\nAll the morning of the day--it was a Monday--I was down the\r\nSchlüsselburg Road, where a disturbance was most likely to occur; but,\r\non the surface, everything was still. The steam-trams carried soldiers\r\nwith fixed bayonets as a guard, but otherwise the troops were kept\r\nrather carefully out of sight. Wherever the police saw blinds down, or\r\nother signs of mourning, even in the main streets of the city, they\r\nentered with their revolvers, and sometimes a little knot of spectators\r\ngathered, but there was no appearance of organized resistance or\r\ndemonstration at all. The sun shone, but it was intensely cold. Upon\r\nthe Neva, a few people were crossing with loaded sledges, a few on\r\nfoot were following the fir branches that marked the paths. Women were\r\nwashing clothes by letting them down through square holes they had cut\r\nin the ice, and then beating them with wooden slats. Men were sinking\r\nbag-nets through the ice for fish. Otherwise there was hardly a sign\r\nof life. Nearly all the mills were closed, and those that pretended\r\nto continue work were held by a strong military guard, with sentries\r\nbefore the gates. No throngs of excited work-people now moved along the\r\nfootways or stood at street corners. In one or two of the churches, a\r\nmemorial service was being held for the dead, but for the most part\r\nthe priests refused to open their churches for the purpose, and the\r\nwork-people observed a nobler celebration by remaining at home in their\r\ndarkened rooms.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting a great naval ironworks, closed, like most Government\r\nthings, for want of cash, I heard from one of the chief engineers an\r\nenlightening instance of the Russian Government’s methods in conducting\r\nforeign warfare. For the Japanese War, the works had turned out\r\nmany large guns, fitted with telescopic sights. When the engineers\r\noffered to teach the officers the use of these sights, their offer\r\nwas scornfully refused, and the Government allowed the guns to be\r\ndispatched to the war without a man who understood them. So complete\r\nwas the ignorance, that the cleaners covered the sights, glasses and\r\nall, with vaseline, and, from first to last, no advantage was taken of\r\nthe invention. Yet these are the people who talked of the Japanese as\r\n“yellow monkeys,” sure to scuttle into the sea at the first sound of a\r\nRussian gun. And, what is worse, these are the people who have dictated\r\nEngland’s foreign policy for over half a century. Even the Social\r\nDemocrats, who make no pretence to military knowledge or ambition,\r\ncould hardly defend their country’s interests worse.\r\n\r\nDuring the late afternoon, and far into the night, I was driving\r\nthrough the workmen’s quarters upon the Petersburg Island and other\r\ndistricts north of the main river. All the streets were hushed and\r\nempty. Where, as a rule, the pavements are crowded with men and women\r\ngoing home or shopping for next day, a stillness like death reigned\r\nnow. Even when the hands from some working factory came out between\r\nthe lines of pickets watching the gates, they hurried fast home,\r\nand in a few minutes all was silent again. Perhaps the Tsar and his\r\nminister congratulated each other that order was restored, and the\r\ncorpse of freedom lay quiet at last. They did not consider that the\r\nvery silence was an evidence of the revolution’s continued power--a\r\nproof that the committee which had defied them could still count on the\r\nworking-people’s loyalty to its desire.\r\n\r\nIn the first and, I believe, the only number of one of the many satiric\r\npapers which had lately been suppressed in St. Petersburg, a cartoon\r\nrepresented the Government as a hideous vampire gloating over the body\r\nof a young girl in Russian costume. “I think she’s quiet at last,”\r\nsays the monster with satisfaction, but still a little dubiously. That\r\npicture exactly expressed the situation at the time of my return to St.\r\nPetersburg. Was the sucked and tortured body of freedom really quiet at\r\nlast? The vampire was anxious and dubious. But it certainly looked as\r\nthough she were dead; at all events, she lay very still.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n   _Art Reproduction Co._\r\n\r\n  “I THINK SHE’S QUIET AT LAST!”\r\n\r\n   From the _Vampire_.]\r\n\r\nAll my former friends were in prison now. One after another I called\r\nupon those who had welcomed me so joyfully before, when the world was\r\nbright with hope; and one house-porter after another told me they\r\nhad gone away for a few days, and it would be useless to leave any\r\nmessage. We soon learn the meaning of that formula in Russia. It means\r\nthat the police have come, probably in the middle of the night, have\r\nrouted up the man or woman, seized all papers, money, and anything else\r\nuseful, and driven their victim away in the darkness to some “House of\r\nInquiry” on suspicion of holding the same kind of political views as\r\nthe majority of English people. In the House of Inquiry the suspect\r\nis generally kept from four to six months, while his spirit is being\r\nbroken down and evidence raked together against him. He may then be\r\nbrought up for trial before a judge and sentenced to two years’, five\r\nyears’, or ten years’ imprisonment or exile, according to the state of\r\nthe judge’s political opinions or digestion. He may also be condemned\r\nby “administrative order,” without coming before a tribunal at all.\r\nI believe no “political” has been tried in open court before a jury\r\nsince Vera Sassoulitch was acquitted for the attempted assassination\r\nof the elder Trepoff in 1878. No Russian jury can ever be trusted to\r\ncondemn. But the Russian suspect has two advantages still--he may be\r\nthrown out of prison as unexpectedly as he was thrown in, and with\r\nas little reason given. He may also call upon any one he pleases,\r\nnot necessarily a barrister, to take up his defence, if he is brought\r\nbefore a tribunal. He may thus obtain the satisfaction of having his\r\ncase defended on the broad lines of human reason and obvious justice,\r\ninstead of listening to some professional pleader, stultified by legal\r\ntraining, while he struggles to elude condemnation on a verbal error or\r\nby some uninspiring precedent in commercial fraud. It is very seldom,\r\nhowever, that the most convincing defence makes the least difference to\r\nthe sentence, for that has been decided beforehand.\r\n\r\nA day or two after my return to St. Petersburg, I was shown a letter\r\nfrom a friend who had been locked up in a House of Inquiry for speaking\r\nat Liberal meetings and for feeding the children of work-people\r\nduring the second general strike. He had sometimes written, also, for\r\na Progressive newspaper, and it must be remembered that the Tsar’s\r\nManifesto of October 30th had granted freedom of the press as well as\r\nfreedom of public meeting. Yet the suspicion of these three crimes\r\nwas sufficient to show that he must be put out of the way like a mad\r\ndog. The letter was written on three sides, and each side marked by\r\na broad yellow cross drawn diagonally from corner to corner as a\r\nproof that the prison authorities had read it. Yellow seems to be the\r\nfavourite official colour in Russia, as I noticed before in the case\r\nof the “yellow ticket” or passport which binds the prostitutes almost\r\nhopelessly to their way of life; and the yellow cross, signifying the\r\ngaoler’s approval of the contents, shows that the prisoner did not in\r\nany way exaggerate his condition. The letter was written simply for\r\nthe information of another friend who had hitherto escaped the common\r\nmartyrdom which rewards all lovers of freedom in Russia. I translate a\r\npart of it:--\r\n\r\n   “My cell is five paces long by two wide. It has a window, the\r\n   bottom of which is just above the level of my eyes, so that I\r\n   can’t look out. There is a bed, a chair, and a table, all of\r\n   iron and fastened with clamps to the wall. In the daytime the\r\n   cell is fairly light, and the electricity is turned on from\r\n   eight to nine in the evening.\r\n\r\n   “At six I get up. At half-past six a hand is thrust through ‘the\r\n   eye’ (spy-hole) in the door with some black bread. At seven a\r\n   different hand pours boiling water into my jug in the same way.\r\n   I have to buy my own tea. At ten I am led through the corridor\r\n   into a little court, where I am allowed to walk round and round\r\n   for twenty-five minutes with other ‘politicals.’ But if we\r\n   speak or look at each other or say ‘good-morning,’ the walk is\r\n   stopped--and it is my only chance of getting a breath of air.\r\n   At eleven a bell rings, and the ‘eye’ is opened for letters or\r\n   any orders for purchases that I want to send. But I am allowed\r\n   to order things only four times a week, and, of course, only as\r\n   long as my money lasts. At the same time a hand pours in boiling\r\n   water again for tea. From half-past eleven till twelve is\r\n   dinner-time, and I get a biggish basin of watery barley soup or\r\n   pea soup, or else a thin fluid with scraps of meat and cabbage\r\n   floating in it.\r\n\r\n   “There is rather a good prison library, especially strong in\r\n   political economy. But it is very hard to get the books I want,\r\n   and the pages are defaced by the gaolers, who always think the\r\n   dots and hyphens are signals from the prisoners to each other.\r\n   In the afternoon, especially when it gets dark, I lie on my bed,\r\n   or walk up and down the cell, till at eight o’clock, as I said,\r\n   the electric light is turned on for an hour. About six I get the\r\n   boiling water and soup again. Sometimes letters reach me, but\r\n   they are always kept till they are old. Sometimes I am allowed\r\n   a visit of three minutes’ conversation through the ‘eye’ in the\r\n   door. Of course, the gaoler is always within hearing.”\r\n\r\nThe treatment is not worse, it is perhaps rather better than the\r\npeculiarly brutalizing treatment of prisoners in England. There is\r\nsomething distinctly paternal in the provision of a library especially\r\nstrong in political economy. But it must be remembered that this friend\r\nof mine had never been accused, had never been tried, and was only\r\nsuspected of a crime which all the Liberals of England, from the Prime\r\nMinister downwards, commit every waking hour of their lives amid the\r\napplause of our nation; unless, indeed, it be urged against him that\r\nhe fed the children of strikers--an offence from which our official\r\nLiberals are often exempt.\r\n\r\nThe particular prison in which this man was confined, was, as I said, a\r\nHouse of Inquiry, but the number of arrests had been so enormous since\r\nthe Moscow rising that the suspects were now being thrust into the\r\nordinary prisons straight away, or into any hole where they could be\r\nkept tied up. Just across the breadth of river from the Winter Palace\r\nof the Tsars, and the dilettante picture-gallery of the Hermitage,\r\nglitters the long-drawn brazen spire which marks the old fortress of\r\nSt. Peter and St. Paul, the citadel and grave of Peter the Great.\r\nEncased in monotonous marble slabs, and surrounded by hideous emblems\r\nof death and glory, there lie the bodies of all those melancholy\r\ntyrants from Peter downwards. Perhaps there are some people still left\r\namong the royal family who sincerely reckon those dull tombs among\r\nRussia’s treasures; but close beside the church along the Neva, so low\r\nthat some of the cells are beneath the river level, run the dungeons\r\nwhich form the true Martyrs’ Memorial of the country--the places that\r\nwill some day be honoured like the graves of the saints, for they are\r\nconsecrated by the blood and suffering of hundreds of men and women\r\nwho fought for freedom, though they seemed to fight in vain. This was\r\nthe prison where again the foremost champions of freedom were now\r\ncooped up. Khroustoloff was there, the man of genius who organized the\r\nfirst general strike and was the chairman of the Workmen’s Council\r\nwhen I used to attend their sittings two months before. Not long after\r\nmy return, the rumour went that he had been shot in the prison yard.\r\nNothing was known for certain, but the thing was only too likely, for\r\na tyranny does not spare its finest enemies, and Khroustoloff will be\r\nknown to all Russian history as the man who forced the Government to\r\ndefend itself by that lying Manifesto with which it betrayed the people\r\nas with a kiss.\r\n\r\nJust outside the fortress the Tsar is building a palace for his former\r\nmistress--a Polish dancing girl, said to have been attractive without\r\nbeauty--and less than a mile further up the river on the same bank,\r\nstands the large modern prison called the Cross (Kresty), whether from\r\nits shape or as an emblem of salvation, is uncertain. It is a dreary,\r\nred-brick building of the ordinary type, like Wormwood Scrubbs, and the\r\nofficials hang their windows with caged birds as ornaments in keeping\r\nwith the architecture. That prison also was crammed with “politicals.”\r\nIn fact, it was the same story in all the prisons of Russia--the same\r\nthing as I had seen in Moscow, Kieff, and Odessa. Somehow room had to\r\nbe found in the gaols for 20,000 Liberals--that was the lowest estimate\r\nI heard at the time, and a few weeks afterwards the moderate estimate\r\nrose to 70,000, and a high estimate of 100,000 was commonly accepted.\r\nWe cannot wonder that a bankrupt Government felt only too delighted\r\nwhen it could kill off its prisoners by batches of thirty-five together\r\nas in Moscow, or of forty-five together as happened at Fellin in\r\nEsthonia just after Vladimir’s Day, when that number of journalists and\r\nmen of letters were collected there and shot in bloody comradeship.\r\nThe dead are so cheap in their subterranean cells.\r\n\r\nEnglish people are constantly marvelling, with some superiority in\r\ntheir tone, why it is that the Russian revolution has brought to\r\nlight no man or commanding genius--“no Cromwell,” that is their usual\r\nphrase--to direct its energies to victory. Let them search the dungeons\r\nand the graves. Perhaps they may find a Cromwell there.\r\n\r\nTill quite lately the very noblest of the “politicals” would naturally\r\nhave been sent to the Schlüsselburg--the old fortress-prison standing\r\non an island where the Ladoga Lake pours out the great stream of\r\nthe Neva some forty miles above the city. But three days before the\r\nanniversary of Bloody Sunday, a ukase was issued converting that\r\nancient dungeon into a mint, and removing the few prisoners who still\r\nremained. I believe there were only five of them--old men and, perhaps,\r\nwomen who had tried to do something for freedom once, and in their\r\nliving graves had already become myths of the dreadful past. About\r\ntheir identification and their removal to other dungeons there was much\r\nmystery, and the rumour ran that two of them had strangely disappeared,\r\nas well as others whose fading names and records were recalled by\r\nmemories growing obscure.\r\n\r\nTo such mysteries another mystery now succeeded; for every one,\r\nexcept the few who clung to the orthodox photographic faith about the\r\ninexhaustible ingots of the Russian treasury, was marvelling why the\r\nterrible fortress had been converted into a mint, of all things, and\r\nwhence the bullion was to come for coinage there. I am inclined to\r\nthink that the Government was misled, like most people, by treacherous\r\nparallels from history, and, knowing the Schlüsselburg’s evil name, had\r\nfeared a second Fall of the Bastille. It was a needless anxiety. The\r\nSchlüsselburg is too far away for popular frenzy; but the Peter-Paul\r\nfortress is close at hand and its abominations grow.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the conversion of a blood-stained fortress into an empty\r\ncoin chest made no difference to the situation. The reaction went\r\ntrampling along its course, and under it the country lay paralyzed.\r\nDuring the four weeks after the collapse of the Moscow rising (January\r\n7th to February 7th), 78 newspapers were suspended, 58 editors\r\nimprisoned, 2,000 post and telegraph assistants dismissed, over 20\r\nworkmen’s restaurants closed in St. Petersburg to prevent relief to the\r\nunemployed, a state of siege was declared in 62 towns, a minor state of\r\nsiege in 34 towns, 17 temporary prisons were opened, 1,716 “politicals”\r\nwere imprisoned in St. Petersburg alone, and 1,400 “politicals” were\r\nsummarily executed under martial law, not including the large and\r\nuncertain numbers that were put to death in Moscow after law and order\r\nhad been re-established.[4]\r\n\r\nSuch was the terrified blood-thirstiness of that unhappy little body of\r\nmen called the Committee of Ministers, who went down to Tsarskoe Selo\r\nby a guarded train along a guarded line nearly every day to discuss\r\nhow best they could stifle down the hopes of liberty, and retain for\r\nthemselves and their narrow circle of friends or patrons the cash, the\r\nmedals, the jobbery, the social distinction, the female affection, and\r\nall the many other delights of power. They did not number more than\r\neight or ten poor mortals, not removed by many years from the abyss\r\nof death, and, from all I hear, only two or three of them had been\r\nborn more brutal or scoundrelly of nature than ordinary rulers are.\r\nOne would have liked to listen to their conversation in those trains,\r\nas, with unctuous regret for the stern necessity laid upon them, they\r\ndecided how many more should die. Some, like distracted Witte, whom\r\nwe have heard blubbering over the wickedness of the dear children he\r\nwas compelled to butcher; or like Count Dmitri Tolstoy, the Minister\r\nof Education, formerly President of the Academy of Artists; or like\r\nShipoff, Minister of Finance to the penniless State, who only a year\r\nbefore had voted for universal suffrage; or like Nemeschaeff, Minister\r\nof Communications, who had been a chef to a railway, almost as good\r\nas a workman, and also had voted for universal suffrage; or like\r\nBirileff, Minister of Marine, who among Russian officers passed for a\r\ntype of incredible integrity because he had abstained from swindling\r\nhis country when he had the power; or like Rediger, the incapable\r\nbut comparatively honest Minister of War--all these had once enjoyed\r\na pleasing reputation for Liberalism, as had Prince Obolensky, the\r\nnew Procurator of the Holy Synod, and successor to Pobiedonostseff\r\nas keeper of Russia’s orthodoxy. At one time probably nearly all of\r\nthem had received the compliment of being thought a little dangerous\r\nby their relations, and now, under the ancient curse of tyrants, they\r\nwere consumed by the knowledge of the virtue they had left behind.\r\nBut they could not turn back--they had entered upon a road with iron\r\nwalls. For guide to the entrance of that road they had deliberately\r\nchosen Durnovo, the new Privy Councillor, lately made permanent in his\r\nMinistry of Interior. And beside Durnovo stood his uneducated relation\r\nAkinoff, new-appointed Minister of Justice.\r\n\r\nThus was the Committee of Ministers helplessly committed to preserve\r\nin wealth and power that handful of useless human beings who may be\r\ncalled the Tsardom or the Government or the ruling classes--the same\r\nkind of men who for generations past have brought all that long tale\r\nof poverty, ignorance, and bloodshed upon the Russian people. Nothing\r\ncould save them from the fatality of their own choice. They were forced\r\nto go on with it now, driven day by day a few steps further along\r\nthe inevitable road. So day by day they gave their orders to General\r\nDiedulin, the new Chief of Police and Durnovo’s assistant at the\r\nInterior, and day by day the noblest and most thoughtful men and women\r\nof Russia were shot, imprisoned, or dragged away to the oblivion of\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nI know that in England one of the pleasant myths circulated by the\r\nTsar’s hirelings, or sanctimonious patrons, is that Siberian exile has\r\nbeen abolished. It is as untrue as the similar myth about flogging\r\nthe peasants for taxes. In St. Petersburg on January 26th, I met a\r\nlady whose brother, a conspicuous barrister in a large city of Central\r\nRussia, had just been exiled to Siberia for five years because he took\r\nthe chair at a public meeting. Like so many other confiding people, he\r\nwas fool enough to trust to a Tsar’s Manifesto, and now as a reward for\r\nhis simple faith, cut off from his friends, his family, and his career,\r\nhe is moving by stages from prison to prison towards the dreary spot\r\nwhere the best years of life must be spent, even if he ever returns. It\r\nwould, indeed, be unthrifty of the Government, when they have crammed\r\nthe Russian prisons to bursting point, not to take advantage of the\r\nSiberian system so providentially organized by their predecessors in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nOn the whole horizon of St. Petersburg life only one sign of hope\r\nappeared. In the lecture theatre of the Mokhovaya, leading out of\r\nthe Nevsky, where the educated revolutionists of the middle classes\r\nare accustomed to hold their meetings, a quiet body of men used to\r\nassemble every afternoon, with a few quiet men and women to listen.\r\nThey were the Constitutional Democrats, whose meetings Witte had been\r\ncompelled, not to permit, but to ignore, because in case of refusal\r\nthey threatened to remove into Finland, and it was not so easy to\r\nspy upon them there. Delegates had arrived from all parts of the\r\nEmpire--Mohammedan Tartars from Kazan, Armenians from the Caucasus,\r\nheathen Mongols from the uttermost parts of the East, speaking no human\r\ntongue, nor to be understood by any, had not old Professor Clementz\r\nbeen discovered still alive among his specimens of anthropology.\r\nBanished in his prime to the extremity of Mongolia in the hope that he\r\nmight die of savagery and cold, he had dwelt so many years among the\r\nheathen that in face and language he could hardly be distinguished from\r\nthem, and now they found in him their friend, the one man in the city\r\nto whom their monosyllabic squeaks and sounds conveyed a human meaning.\r\n\r\nSo the delegates met, and listened and debated, discussing the\r\ntactics to be employed if ever time should overtake the promised Duma,\r\nwhich continually receded. What was the right course for men who\r\nhoped nothing from violence and yet would fight for freedom; men who\r\ndistrusted haste, believed in law, and yet aimed at revolution? Being\r\nconcerned with subjects so far-reaching, their debates were naturally\r\nmore abstract than is usual among hardened old Parliamentarians like\r\nourselves, to whom “the middle of next week” expresses an unimaginable\r\nand negligible distance of time. But they boasted themselves practical\r\nas Russian parties go, and at all events they were not hampered, as our\r\nLiberals usually are, by class tradition and social influence. I mean,\r\nfor instance, they would never endure anything so ludicrous as a House\r\nof Lords in their constitution, and if they should ever come to real\r\npower, they would enjoy the very unusual advantage of a clear field.\r\nBut their immediate object was to form a strong block of opposition\r\nto the representatives of the six reactionary parties with which the\r\nGovernment designed to flood the Duma when the elections came--such\r\nparties as the Octobrists, or nominal supporters of the Manifesto; the\r\nparty of “Legal Order,” or Law and Order, as we say; and the party of\r\nIndustry and Commerce.\r\n\r\nBeside the platform at their meetings stood a large death-bed portrait\r\nof Sergius Troubetskoy, the Rector of Moscow University, who had\r\nsuddenly died in the previous September while pleading for freedom of\r\nspeech, as I mentioned in the Introduction. Across the portrait was\r\nwritten the inscription, “The Champion of Freedom,” and the spirit of\r\nthe great Zemstvoist leader might well be said to direct the methods\r\nand purposes of the assembly. Among the living leaders present were\r\nPetrunkevitch, who had succeeded to Troubetskoy’s position upon the\r\nMoscow Zemstvo; Struve, long the exiled editor of the Russian paper,\r\n_Emancipation_ (_Osvobojdenie_) in Paris; and Miliukoff, so\r\nwell known in France through David Soskice’s translation of his book\r\non Russian culture, and in England and America through his own Chicago\r\nlectures upon _Russia and its Crisis_. He almost alone among\r\nall the Russians I met in St. Petersburg at that time still retained\r\nthe power of hope and enthusiasm undiminished, in spite of all the\r\ndisasters of the past seven weeks.\r\n\r\n   “The reaction,” he said to me, “cannot last very long. The\r\n   Moscow rising was a great mistake, and at the end of it I too\r\n   almost despaired. I thought all the educated people and the\r\n   well-to-do would be permanently set against change. But the\r\n   Government’s violence has kept them on our side. The “classes”\r\n   are as much sickened by the slaughter as other people. They have\r\n   learnt that it is the Government, and not the revolutionists,\r\n   who are the party of destruction and disorder. Reaction? Why, it\r\n   is already over. The spirit of the thing is dead.”\r\n\r\nComing at such a time, such words were startling in their confidence.\r\nBut then Professor Miliukoff is one of those few happy people who have\r\ncarried with them the glories of youth into middle age, and there is\r\nno glory of youth more enviable than the wisdom which, as the Preacher\r\nsaid, is the mother of holy hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                       THE PRIEST AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shallows of the Gulf of Finland were frozen hard, and from a\r\ndistance the sea looked like a huge flat plain covered with snow, while\r\nwind and grey storms of drift raged over it, blotting out the horizon.\r\nBut when, almost imperceptibly, the sledge quitted the flat land for\r\nthe flat sea, the green ice sometimes lay bare upon the surface, or\r\nthrew up a sharp green edge, and sometimes the hollow rumble of the\r\nrunners told of the deeper water beneath. At one place a few planks had\r\nbeen thrown across a gaping crack, where the current or the pressure\r\nof ice had split the great field, and a dark line of water stretched\r\naway on either hand till it was lost to sight in the storm. The track\r\nwas marked by the usual Christmas trees stuck in the ice, and by tall\r\nsignal posts as well. Yet, as the wind and driving snow increased, it\r\nwas impossible to see from one mark to the next, and the horse felt\r\nhis way along, like a man moving from lamp-post to lamp-post in a\r\nLondon fog. Sometimes another sledge suddenly appeared out of limbo\r\ntwo or three yards in front. At three points small wooden huts had\r\nbeen erected as shelters for the lost or frozen. Huge lanterns on poles\r\nglimmered through the dark flakes. Driven by the rushing wind, wheels\r\nwith wooden sails tugged at ropes, and out of the obscurity a deep bell\r\nsounded, ominous as the bells rung by the waves around our cliffs. For\r\nthe dangerous tempest was blowing, which, I believe, the natives call\r\nthe “Vouga.”\r\n\r\nOn a sudden a shadowy rampart was seen, a bank of storm-twisted trees,\r\na dimly discerned church, and so we came to the island of Kronstadt,\r\nfamed for its fortress, its mutiny, and its living saint.\r\n\r\nIt was to visit the frozen sea and the miracle-working saint that I\r\nhad come, and of the few passers-by who struggled against the snow I\r\nasked for Father John. At first I feared that the saint’s European\r\nfame had hardly yet reached Kronstadt, where he lives, and from which\r\nhe takes his title. But after a time we were directed to a largish\r\nmodern house, which he has fitted up as a refuge, partly, I think,\r\nfor the poor, partly for the sick, or other unhappy people, who stand\r\nin need of miracles. The rooms inside are large and very clean, all\r\nfilled with narrow iron bedsteads, covered with browny-grey blankets,\r\nas in our barracks or superior doss-houses. A notice on the door gave\r\nthe price of a bed for the night at thirty kopecks--say sevenpence\r\nhalfpenny. That is about threepence halfpenny higher than the average\r\nLondon doss, but it seems fair that those who seek a miracle should pay\r\nsomething extra for it, and the tariff in our common lodging-houses is\r\nnot inclusive.\r\n\r\nI had not time to make further observations when I was seized by an\r\neager crowd of women who thronged the rooms and passages--peasant women\r\nfrom the mainland and work-people from the dockyards, all muffled\r\nup in shawls and hoods and blankets. Excited benevolence shone in\r\ntheir faces, as with cries and exhortations they clutched my clothing\r\nand hurried me through one large dormitory, which appeared to be a\r\nlying-in ward, into another where the crowd was thicker still. Being\r\nthrust eagerly among the worshippers--for there is joy in heaven over\r\none sinner that repenteth--I perceived a small altar beneath a large\r\nand brilliant icon hanging on the wall. The altar was made of a deal\r\ntable with a white cloth over it, and on the cloth stood a large\r\nenamelled-iron soup-tureen. It was white with a blue edge, and filled\r\nwith a yellowish liquid, which I supposed to be holy. In front of the\r\naltar, with his back towards us, stood a short, grey-haired figure, in\r\na robe of black flowered damask or brocade, with a crimson border round\r\nthe neck and halfway down the back.\r\n\r\nHe was just raising his hands in some act of adoration, when, becoming\r\naware of the religious tumult of my entrance, he faced smartly round,\r\nabandoned the altar, and came, as it were, bounding in my direction.\r\nUncertain how to receive him, I stood my ground and held out my hand;\r\nbut entirely disregarding that, he sprang upon me, and raising himself\r\nlightly upon his toes--for the top of his head did not reach to my\r\nchin--with uplifted arm he began fumbling about in my hair with his\r\nfingers. It was so sudden. In five seconds I had received his blessing.\r\nHe had blessed me by assault. For all I know, he had accomplished a\r\nmiracle upon me. The women stood round and sighed their pleasure. “He\r\nnever treats us to a blessing like that, never!” they murmured with\r\nadmiring envy.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to rest before me, I perceived that he was a little\r\ngrey-bearded old gentleman, trim and lean and ruddy. He looked about\r\nsixty, but his followers say he is seventy-seven, so that his very\r\nactivity is miraculous. One side of his forehead bulged with some\r\ndisease, but from his pale grey eyes looked a healthy spirit. Kindly\r\nand innocent, practical, or even housewifely, I should say, rather\r\nthan intellectual or inspired. There was nothing of the rapt mystic\r\nabout him, nothing of the divine seer contemplating eternity. Indeed,\r\nI was told that he himself makes no claim to prophetic vision, and\r\nhis gift of foretelling distant events must be unconscious. One of\r\nhis chief attributes in sanctity appears to be that he lived with the\r\nsame wife for fifty years, I believe all the time at Kronstadt; and I\r\nsee no cause to question his miraculous powers, especially as I have\r\nknown other people similarly endowed, though for qualifications of a\r\ndifferent kind.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, smiling up at me for a moment with innocent good will,\r\nand I then perceived that the crimson border of his robe reached\r\nhalfway down his chest, as well as down his back, and that round his\r\nneck, by a heavy silver chain, hung a large silver cross--the Russian\r\nOrthodox cross, with a short bar nailed low down upon the shaft for\r\nthe feet of the Crucified to rest upon, and placed slantingly, so that\r\none end might be higher than the other, because by Eastern tradition\r\nChrist was lame on the right foot. I also perceived that the saint’s\r\nhand, though fine in itself, was worn, as though by the labour of\r\ncontinual benediction. But observing that my eyes rested upon it, he\r\nsmiled, more benignly than ever, and did what is perfectly natural to\r\nany Russian saint or lady--he held it up for me to kiss. It is a peril\r\none is sure to encounter among the priests of the Orthodox Church, and\r\nover and over again I have resolved to go through with it manfully.\r\nBut when the final moment comes, the stubborn British blood begins to\r\njib and swerve, like a horse that cannot be brought up to his fences,\r\nand grasping his hand in mine I shook it warmly. I am afraid the women\r\nwere grieved to think I should remain a heretic, in spite of all the\r\nadvantages they had so eagerly procured me, but there was no help.\r\n\r\nThe little saint then turned back to the altar and took up the service\r\nwhere he had left off, just as a wood-pigeon takes up his comfortable\r\ncadence at the note where last it was broken. The people renewed their\r\ninterrupted crossings and prostrations, and a young peasant beside me,\r\nhis dark red hair covering his shoulders, and his single outer garment\r\ngathered round his waist with a rope, displayed incredible activity\r\nin striking his forehead against the bare boards and springing up\r\nagain repeatedly almost without pause. I should like to have known\r\nfor what favour he was so urgent, and willingly would I have granted\r\nit if it had been in my power, for no human being could have remained\r\nobdurate to such importunity. But the service ended, and with a throng\r\naccompanying him the saint, putting his great-coat over his robes and\r\nhis goloshes over his boots, departed down the street to some other\r\nscene of hallowed beneficence.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to realize that this was Father John of Kronstadt, regarded\r\nby revolutionists as among the most dangerous enemies of the Movement.\r\nIn the political cartoons he almost always figures among the leaders\r\nof reaction. One sees pictures of him in his vestments standing beside\r\na cannon trained upon the crowd, or with the other Ministers admiring\r\na huge Christmas tree hung with skulls. His saying, at the time of\r\nFather Gapon’s procession, that “only a sinner could strive against his\r\nTsar,” is well known. He is believed, perhaps truly, to possess great\r\ninfluence in the Tsar’s family, especially over the women, such as the\r\nDowager Tsarina. According to rumour, his advice is invariably given\r\nagainst every proposal of change or advancement, and the enthusiastic\r\nwomen who procured me his blessing, are identified with the mothers and\r\nwives of the most violent and merciless gang of the Black Hundred. That\r\nis all very possible, and the recent scandals about a certain Virgin\r\nof Kronstadt, who saw her way to making money out of the situation\r\nby vicarious sanctitude, are only such as seem to arise inevitably\r\naround a fellow mortal of much belauded virtue, whether they are true\r\nor not. It is very probable also that the mothers of the Black Hundred\r\nsecure comparatively honest half-crowns by arranging special interviews\r\nand privileges for visitors to the saint. To be sure, I had not to\r\npay a penny for my blessing, but I have known others, less favoured\r\nby Heaven, who expended as much as two pound ten for very inferior\r\nadvantages. When all is said, the detraction of his opponents, and his\r\nown abhorrence of progress appear to me the least miraculous things\r\nabout him. Take a man in youth, train him for years in a seminary\r\nwhere he meets no one but young priests like himself, and hears no one\r\nbut old priests such as he is intended to become; give him no kind\r\nof knowledge but ritual and dogma, which he must accept unquestioned\r\nor perish; let him live many years with one woman in one small place,\r\namong people who never contradict him, but either regard his words as\r\ndivine, or ignore them as parsonic; add a kindly simplicity to the\r\nblank of ignorance; expose a rather small and finikin personality\r\nto feminine adulation; and if you do not produce the very model of\r\npriesthood as exemplified in Father John of Kronstadt, there will be a\r\nmiracle indeed.\r\n\r\nI struggled back again across the frozen sea, where the storm raged\r\nwith increased violence, and on reaching St. Petersburg, I hastened\r\nto a remarkable gathering in the great hall of the Conservatorium.\r\nIt was a concert given by a body which, with intentional vagueness,\r\ncalled itself the Committee of the Working People, and its purpose\r\nwas to raise funds for the assistants at the Workmen’s Dining Rooms.\r\nThe performance was announced for eight o’clock, but I need not have\r\nhastened; for, as I have already noticed, there is no pedantic and\r\ninconsiderate punctuality in Russian affairs, and when I arrived,\r\nsome three quarters of an hour late, I found the huge audience still\r\npouring in, and I might have waited another half-hour without missing\r\nany of the programme. But at concerts the audience is usually the most\r\ninteresting part, at all events to a foreigner, and I found myself\r\nin the midst of the very people who, until quite lately, have been\r\nthe real revolutionists of Russia. Not very many actual work-people\r\nwere there, for the prices of seats kept them away; but the vast\r\nconcert-hall was soon packed with the educated, the professional men\r\nand women, the “proletariat of intellect”--writers, journalists,\r\nbarristers, doctors, crowds of students, and a good many officers in\r\nuniform, though I think that perhaps most of them were army doctors.\r\nThe scene was a fine example of the frank democracy that distinguishes\r\nthe Russian people--the enviable disregard of all the weary old\r\ndistinctions of rank, profession, wealth, or dress. It arises, perhaps,\r\nfrom the ancient village communism, as I have already suggested, and\r\nfrom the common use of Christian names and diminutives, which spreads a\r\nbrotherly feeling among all classes. Perhaps also from the comparative\r\nunimportance of commercial people until lately; for in most countries\r\nit is the commercial classes that maintain inequality. In no society,\r\noutside savagedom, have I found such indifference to the nature and\r\ndistinctions of dress as in Russia. At this concert every class and\r\nfashion of costume was to be seen, and no one was regarded as a queer\r\nand dubious character if he dressed to please himself. It is quite\r\npossible, no doubt, that the brains of many there stood above the\r\nfreezing point of British social sanity, but in all that I have seen\r\nof Russian life, I have observed the same democratic ease, the same\r\ndisregard of the dress that marks a class distinction. It is this sense\r\nof the equality of men that brings the Russians and the French together\r\nand makes the monstrous alliance of their Governments appear almost\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nOf course, the whole audience was revolutionary, but in Russia\r\nrevolution is not thought to imply insanity so much as intelligence,\r\nand large numbers had determined there should be no doubt as to their\r\nopinions. Many of the students, with long hair all on end, wore the\r\nRussian tunic, and no one stared. Some girl-students--those indomitable\r\n“Kursistki,” on whom the soldiers have no mercy--were dressed in the\r\nloose black blouse, fitting closely to the throat and buttoned along\r\nthe top of the shoulder instead of down the front or back. A few\r\ngentler spirits had yielded to a tiny edge of white collar above the\r\nblack. But the blouse of the violent shone red, all gules from throat\r\nto waist, and the more revolutionary a girl is by nature, the thicker\r\nis her hair, and the lower it hangs over her eyes and ears. Her little\r\nfur cap also has no brim, as others use, but is plain like a man’s; for\r\na brim is compromise, and at the bottom of the slope of compromise lies\r\nignoble peace.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the concert began. Perhaps concert is hardly the\r\nright word, for I suppose no human soul in all that mass of people\r\nhad gone to hear music or singing, or cared very much what musical\r\nsounds were made. Certainly, the musical performers were good, but\r\nthe interest lay with others--with the well-known young actress who\r\nin a voice only slightly more emotional than common speech recited\r\nsome short poem which all could hear, while the piano played a hardly\r\nperceptible accompaniment; or with the famous author who just sat in\r\na chair upon the stage, and read some vivid scene or parable from his\r\nown works or another’s. As often as not he read it badly, but that made\r\nno difference. This was no shrine of art for art’s sake. Behind those\r\nquiet and halting words burned the whole fire of the revolution, and\r\nthe applause was not kept for the best performance, but for the most\r\ndaring passage, or for the hero who had been longest imprisoned for\r\nthe cause. Such applause as that I have never heard. There was a vital\r\nintensity in the enthusiasm that no art could inspire. Time after time\r\nthe man or woman was recalled. Four times or five times the same piece\r\nwould be repeated, and still the applause seemed as if it could not\r\nend. Eleven times one man was recalled, the whole audience standing up\r\nand shouting his name in a tumult of admiration. Not that he recited\r\nwell, but it was his own work that he recited, and he had only just\r\ncome out of gaol.\r\n\r\nThe form of the recitations was almost invariably the parable. Some\r\nsimple scene or fable was narrated, so harmless and childlike on the\r\nsurface, that the enemy could find no handle for his rage, but inwardly\r\nit was charged with a significance like hidden flame. It is a form very\r\nnatural to Russia, for it has grown out of the peasants’ folk-tale\r\nand proverb, and the perpetual danger of open expression has kept it\r\nalive. So in Gorky’s well-known parable, which was one of the many\r\nrecited, the falcon soars in freedom through the sunlit air, and the\r\nsnake remains coiled under the dark and chilly stones; but presently\r\nthe falcon falls to the ground wounded and dying, while the snake\r\ncongratulates himself upon the pleasing security of his own habits.\r\nSometimes it was but a common scene of military life that was narrated;\r\nsometimes there came a brief outburst of triumph, “O sleepless nights,\r\nyour fruits are seen at last!” And in one poem the part of women in\r\nRussia’s revolution was described almost without subterfuge.\r\n\r\nIn the souls of the audience only one thought lived. A suppressed\r\nexcitement breathed throughout the hall. As the words of the speakers\r\nor singers rose and fell, the air trembled with the beat of all those\r\nminds in unison. There was no sound. Each great word was awaited as\r\none awaits the notes of a solemn music. But it was not the words that\r\nwere the greatest thing, it was not the performers, not the martyrs,\r\nnor even the audience. The greatest thing was the common faith of all.\r\nUnder that outward scene of gleaming lights and varied personality\r\none felt the secret touch of danger, and only in danger is the highest\r\ncommunity to be found. One felt the deep and passionate glow of a life\r\nbrief and insecure. One felt the spirit careless of everything--of joy,\r\nof passion, of life itself--of everything, but the one great cause--the\r\nonly thing that counted, the soul of the crowd, the consciousness that\r\nbreathed through the air and kept us still. The words ceased. There was\r\na gasp while like one man the great assembly drew in its breath, and\r\nthen with a rushing wind rose the tempest of applause. And yet it was\r\nnot the words, nor even the speaker: it was the revolution that was\r\nadored.\r\n\r\nTo have a cause like that, to dwell with danger for the sake of it\r\nevery day and night, to confront continually an enemy vital, pitiless,\r\nalmost omnipotent, and execrable beyond words--what other life can\r\ncompare to that, not only in grandeur, but in the satisfaction of\r\nintellect and courage and love and every human faculty? So tyranny\r\nbrings its compensations.\r\n\r\nAt various intervals the audience trooped out from the hall, and walked\r\nup and down the great ante-rooms and passages provided in all Russian\r\nplaces of assembly. They greeted each other, they embraced, drank tea,\r\nand buzzed with conversation. The intervals lasted about three-quarters\r\nof an hour, and were of the highest interest to every one. The first\r\nended just before midnight, the second about two. Whether the third\r\never ended I did not discover, for I was lost in memories of English\r\naudiences, upon whose faces a real expression begins to dawn soon after\r\neleven--an expression of impatient anxiety whether they will catch the\r\nlast ‘bus home to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                            A BLOODY ASSIZE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of January I left St. Petersburg for Riga and the Baltic\r\nProvinces. As in other parts of Russia, the hopes of change had\r\nfaded there, and the whole land lay prostrate under a bloodthirsty\r\nsuppression, the more savage because it was encouraged by a double\r\nrace hatred--the ancient feud of German, Russian, and Lett. As I came\r\nat sunrise through the fir forests and frozen heaths of Livonia,\r\ntwenty-five men were being shot in cold blood among the sandhills\r\nbeside the railway. They were tied together in a row by their feet and\r\narms, and they fell together; but the firing was so bad that many were\r\nhardly hit at all, and had to be finished off at close quarters before\r\nthey were heaped together into a trench already prepared for them.\r\nWhen I reached the town, the first thing I met was a party of twenty\r\nsoldiers with fixed bayonets driving along four boys of eighteen or\r\nnineteen, who marched with their hands in the pockets of their long\r\ncoats and their caps drawn low down over their pale and weary faces.\r\nThey were being taken to the castle, where, I was told, a hundred\r\nmore lay ready for killing, and would probably be slaughtered on the\r\nsandhills next morning. It was a fitting entrance for me into these\r\nonce peaceful and civilized provinces, where now the bloody assize was\r\nraging.\r\n\r\nThe daily papers in Riga are, for the most part, German, but, for\r\nonce, they were on the side of the Government and the Russian troops,\r\nbecause the leaders of the attempted revolution and the victims in its\r\nsuppression were Letts. So they would not be likely to exaggerate the\r\ninjustice and brutality of the assize. Yet each of them, above its\r\ntender German love-story or bit of art criticism, displayed columns\r\nof tabulated slaughter, and the whole local news of the three Baltic\r\nProvinces consisted of shootings, hangings, and floggings. The accounts\r\nwere generally arranged by villages. For instance, from one number of\r\nthe leading Riga paper I take the following reports, almost at random,\r\nout of the columns that appeared above an excellent appreciation of\r\nRuskin’s “Præterita”--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Tarwast.--The whole population of the village over the age of\r\n   fifteen was brought before the court-martial to-day. Six were\r\n   shot on the spot, including one woman; nine were flogged with\r\n   strokes varying from twenty-five to two hundred.”\r\n\r\nI need not say that two hundred strokes of a wooden rod delivered by\r\nsoldiers on the naked body of either a woman or a man would mean\r\nalmost certain death in its most terrible form.\r\n\r\n   “Semzel.--Yesterday six revolutionaries were shot, and four the\r\n   day before. In the neighbouring parish of Lemberg twenty-four\r\n   were flogged.\r\n\r\n   “Kokenhusen.--Nine people were hanged here to-day.\r\n\r\n   “Dahlen.--A squadron of dragoons, half a troop of Cossacks, a\r\n   company of infantry, two cannon, and two machine-guns arrived\r\n   here to-day. Dahlen had elected a revolutionary parish council;\r\n   so a court-martial was held, and four men shot on the spot.\r\n   Several farms were destroyed by shells.\r\n\r\n   “Neuenmühle.--The schoolmaster was hanged on a telephone post\r\n   here to-day, for having allowed public meetings in his school.\r\n   Two young girls were flogged with rods for having stitched a red\r\n   flag.\r\n\r\n   “Wolmar.--This morning early, two boys, one only fifteen,\r\n   evidently much excited, ran up to a patrol of soldiers and\r\n   tried to catch hold of a rifle, saying they would show them\r\n   how to shoot. They were captured, and General Orloff, being\r\n   consulted by telephone, ordered their immediate execution. They\r\n   received the Sacrament, and were shot in the presence of a large\r\n   number of spectators. The execution appears to have exercised a\r\n   salutary impression upon the whole population of Wolmar.”\r\n\r\nVillage after village had that salutary impression exercised upon it,\r\nand one week after another the papers told the same monotonous story of\r\ncold-hearted bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe German landowners, some of whom had suffered considerable losses\r\nduring the peasants’ rising, hounded on the military to vengeance. No\r\nmeasures were harsh enough for them, no executions too bloody. They\r\ntaunted the Governor-General Sollogub with half-hearted mildness, and\r\nclamoured for the appointment of the drunken butcher, General Orloff,\r\nin his place. They appeared to long for the extermination of the race\r\nwhich for centuries had been their servants. A daughter of a great\r\nlandowner, whom I met, said to me, “One of the peasants themselves told\r\nme to-day that at least a third of them deserve to be shot, and he\r\nhopes they will be. I was so glad to hear him say so.”\r\n\r\nCertainly, for those who had run for refuge into the town, as most\r\nof the German landowners had, life was unavoidably dull. Beyond the\r\nrestaurants, two music-halls, and a number of brothels, there was\r\nnothing to distract a gentleman’s mind. The landowner pined for\r\nthe country life and healthy sport to which he was accustomed. His\r\nimagination was haunted by the smoking ruin to which his ancestral\r\nhome had been reduced. When he had once enjoyed the newspaper columns\r\nof executions and floggings which were served with his breakfast, new\r\nevery morning like the love of God, there was really nothing left\r\nto beguile the tedium of existence till evening came. Even then the\r\nentertainment was rather dreary--a German _café chantant_, with\r\nsweet champagne and half a dozen girls whom the proprietor paid to be\r\npleasant. “I suppose I shall have to go and see that dancer again,”\r\nsaid one of the nobility to me, as he yawned and stretched himself. “It\r\nwill be something to do. Her legs aren’t really good, I know, but in\r\nthese times we must all take what pleasure we can.”\r\n\r\nOn going out, we met a strong body of soldiers driving three prisoners\r\nrapidly along the street. Flanking files had been thrown out upon the\r\npavements, and a large rearguard followed. One of the prisoners was\r\na ragged man without a hat, and his arms were pinioned to his sides.\r\nThe other two were women, with white handkerchiefs over their heads,\r\nshowing they were Letts. They passed very quickly, the soldiers, with\r\nfixed bayonets, urging them continually onward from behind. A feeling\r\nof intense excitement prevailed. The soldiers were terrified of a\r\nrescue. An eager though cautious crowd followed at some distance, like\r\nthe children who follow bullocks to the slaughter-houses in Aldgate. So\r\nthey hastened along the road out of the town towards the sandhills, and\r\nin half an hour the man and two women were dead and left warm in their\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\nThe Letts boast themselves to be the Irish of Russia. They are\r\nthe ancient peasant race, whose land has fallen into the hands of\r\nalien conquerors, now supported by a foreign military power. For\r\neight centuries the country of the Letts and the smaller tribes of\r\nLithuanians and Esthonians has been the prey of Germans, Swedes,\r\nand Russians in turn. But the Germans, the descendants of the\r\nSword-Brothers and the Teutonic Order, who first introduced the laws\r\nof conquest and Christianity among them,[5] have remained the chief\r\nowners of the great estates, and the culture of the towns is mainly\r\nGerman also. All three tribes come of an imaginative and artistic\r\nstock. Many of the leading writers and artists of Russia are Letts,\r\nand in their own strange language--probably the most ancient in\r\nEurope, and most nearly akin to old Sanskrit--they possess an immense\r\ncollection of primitive folk-songs and legends. They are not so\r\nadvanced--not so artistic in form and feeling as the Lithuanian songs,\r\nwhich are familiar in German translations, such as the beautiful and\r\ncharacteristic song set to music by Chopin. But the Lettish songs\r\nfollow the ancient Asiatic form, seldom more than four or six lines\r\nlong--simple outbursts of joy and sorrow over the great events of all\r\nhuman life, birth and spring and love and harvest and winter and death.\r\nThey are full of prehistoric myth and lore. Herder translated a few\r\nwhen he was a parson in Riga about a hundred and forty years ago, but I\r\ncannot find that even the Germans have taken the trouble to translate\r\nthem with any completeness. For the tongue has been despised and\r\nneglected, just as Irish was in former years.\r\n\r\nThe race is like the language. Ages have passed over the people since\r\nfirst they settled down among the sandy heaths and quiet watercourses\r\nof the Baltic shore. Their hair and eyes have changed from dark to\r\nfair. Their religion has changed from primitive nature-worship to\r\nCatholicism, and then to Lutheranism. Evangelical they still remain,\r\nthough Russia has tried hard for twenty-five years to make them\r\nOrthodox. But at heart they continue as they originally were, speaking\r\nthe same tongue, doing the same work, and building the same houses.\r\nOn almost any farm you may see the conical outdoor kitchens, modelled\r\non the very huts that they built as they walked from Asia before man\r\nlearnt his letters. Even their modern farmhouses are constructed on a\r\nvery ancient type. They are made entirely of wood without any iron,\r\neven without nails, the corner joints being dovetailed together with\r\nperfect skill. The roofs too, though sometimes thatched with reeds, are\r\nnearly always formed of wooden slabs like slates. Round the central\r\nhouse of two large rooms, with high lofts for winter storage, several\r\nwings or extra chambers are thrown out, for the labourers (Knechte),\r\nor for poorer people who cannot afford a house of their own, but pay\r\na rent in money or work. In this way I have seen five other families\r\ngathered round one peasant court or farm (Gesinde, as it is called,\r\nthe old German word, like the use of Knechte, marking the date of the\r\nPrussian occupation).\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity probably springs from the ancient Lettish habit\r\nof living in isolation, like the Boers, and not huddled together\r\nin villages, like the Germans or Russians. The peasants’ homes are\r\ngenerally at least a mile or two apart. The country is divided into\r\nlarge parishes, but a village can hardly be said to exist, and probably\r\nthis isolation has made the people an easier prey to their successive\r\nconquerors. There are no Lettish towns at all, for such places as\r\nRiga and Dorpat and Mitau were entirely German, but for some hardly\r\nperceptible traces of the Swede, till the curse of Russia fell upon\r\nthem, little over a century ago. Indeed, to enter one of these old\r\ntowns even now, and to live among the spires and tiled roofs after\r\nthe bulbous domes and green iron of Russia, is like going back from\r\nGorky’s sombre desperation to the smile and sunlight of “Meister’s\r\nApprenticeship.”\r\n\r\nScattered through the three Provinces there are about a million and a\r\nhalf of Letts living in this way. Most of them now own their patches of\r\nland, or are buying slowly, by annual payments. They till the ground in\r\nsummer, and in winter they weave with their own looms, spin with their\r\nown spinning wheels, feed the cattle in the barns, and slide the wood\r\nover the snow from the forests. It is not a bad kind of life. Compared\r\nto ordinary Russian peasants, the people are rich beyond dreams, and\r\nthings went pleasantly in the Provinces till the hideous system\r\ncalled Russification began just a quarter of a century ago, upon the\r\naccession of Alexander III.--“The Camel,” as they still call him. It\r\nwas completed, as far as laws can go, in 1889, by the introduction\r\nof Russian jurisdiction and language. Since then, the object of the\r\nRussian Government has been to thwart German industry, to stifle German\r\nculture, and to inflame the Letts against the Germans in hopes that\r\nthe two races may exterminate each other. So far the design appears\r\nlikely to succeed. Corrupt Russian officials govern, ignorant Russian\r\nprofessors have taken the place of men like Harnack at the Dorport\r\nUniversity, untrained Russian teachers pretend to educate children\r\nby means of a language that no child understands, the ancient rights\r\nof the provinces have been taken away one by one, and by continual\r\nincitement the Letts were at last goaded into burning the country\r\nhouses of the German landowners.\r\n\r\nThere are about seven hundred estates in Livonia alone, including the\r\nvarious Crown lands, and in the three Provinces taken together it was\r\nestimated that two hundred and fifty country houses had been burnt.\r\nThis was said to represent about fifteen per cent. of the total of\r\nexisting estates. In many cases, no doubt, the landowners were leading\r\na monotonous and stupid kind of life, and the loss of their possessions\r\nwill open to them a wider horizon, with new chances of happiness.\r\nBut as a rule they are a pleasant, healthy kind of people, like\r\nthe country gentlemen who used to exist in England, and the Lettish\r\npeasants felt no violent personal animosity towards the man whom they\r\nwere accustomed to call Master. One of the largest landowners, for\r\ninstance, the proprietor of four separate estates, thus described to me\r\nhow the trouble began in his favourite country house:--\r\n\r\n“It was last December. Owing to the disturbances throughout the\r\ncountry, I had sent my wife and children into Riga. One day a\r\ndeputation of peasants came and rang at the front door. I received them\r\nin the hall.\r\n\r\n“‘Master (Herr),’ they said; ‘we are heartily sorry, but we have\r\ncondemned you to death.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, you have condemned me to death, have you?’ I answered.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, master,’ they said. ‘We are heartily sorry. You are a good\r\nmaster, and we have nothing against you, but we have condemned you to\r\ndeath.’\r\n\r\n“‘All right,’ I answered; ‘what’s your reason?’\r\n\r\n“‘You see, you have more land than we have,’ they said.\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered; ‘but many of you have more land than others.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, that is true,’ they said; ‘but all the land is ours by right.\r\nYour fathers took it away from us seven hundred years ago, and now we\r\nare going to nationalize it all.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ I answered; ‘I suppose you must do what you like. When are you\r\ngoing to begin?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, master,’ they said, ‘we are heartily sorry. You are a good\r\nmaster, but we have just condemned you to death, and now we have come\r\nto warn you first. Master, we strongly advise you to escape.’\r\n\r\n“So the conversation went on. A few days later, they made an attack\r\nupon the house in the evening. But I had armed two of my own servants;\r\nwe fired a gun from a window, and they all went away again. But after\r\nthat my wife was so frightened that I came into Riga, and now the\r\npeasants are sending us firewood and vegetables twice a week by sledge,\r\nbecause they have heard such things are dear in town.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine the peculiar confusion that would arise in such\r\nkindly and childlike minds when young students and orators, like the\r\nalmost mythical leader “Maxim,” come out to their isolated farms\r\nand preached Karl Marx to them, and the socialisation of wealth, or\r\nthe glories of a Lettish republic. Social change and the sense of\r\nnationality were equal motives in the rising. Excited by wild hopes,\r\ninspired by man’s natural longing for equality, by race hatred, and by\r\nthe oppressions of a stupid and savage Government from abroad, they\r\nturned upon the country houses, the church records, the Government\r\noffices, and the portraits of the Tsar as the symbols of all that stood\r\nbetween them and happiness.\r\n\r\nCertainly the German landowners suffered, and a few were assassinated.\r\nIt was part of the Russian Government’s scheme that they should suffer,\r\nand one of the strangest things in the whole situation of these Baltic\r\nProvinces was the unanimity with which, not only every Lett, but every\r\nGerman whether in town or country, rejected the idea of appealing to\r\nthe German Empire for protection. The suggestion of such a thing made\r\nthe mildest German mad. It united German and Lett like comrades in arms\r\nagainst a common enemy. The Germans cling to their German language\r\nand culture; they will go to any trouble and expense to avoid Russian\r\neducation; they have the utmost contempt for Russian law and justice;\r\nby union with Germany they would gain immensely in government and\r\nprobably in trade. Yet from Russia they will endure any hardship rather\r\nthan look to Berlin for help. It is a remarkable instance of the truth\r\nthat man is governed, not by his interests, but by his tastes. Hearing\r\nthe protest repeated with vehemence by a beautiful German lady whose\r\nhome had been burnt down, I asked her the reason, and she said: “We\r\ncould not endure to be told at every corner not to spit and not to\r\nlean out of the window.”\r\n\r\nSo the landowners suffer, and bear those ills they have. But the man\r\nwhose suffering to me seemed least deserved was not a landowner, but\r\na country parson. He was so old that I may mention his name without\r\nharm, and it is known to the scholars of Europe; for he was Pastor\r\nBielenstein, the greatest authority upon the Lettish language and\r\nliterature, and authorities are very few. I found him in Mitau, the\r\nCourland capital, a quiet German town not far from Riga. There he had\r\ntaken refuge in a few small rooms, when the peasants chased him from\r\nthe parsonage, which had been his for sixty years and his father’s\r\nbefore him. In mind and appearance he belonged to an age that Germany\r\nhas long left behind--the simple age of the Humboldts and the Grimms.\r\nHe must be one of the very few Germans left who remember the death of\r\nGoethe, and to listen to him was like conversing with those gentle\r\nfollowers of learning a century ago, who combined a zeal for knowledge\r\nwith a childlike trust in “the dear God.” All the sixty years in his\r\nparish had been devoted to the cure of souls and the collection of\r\nevery fragment of Lettish literature--folk-songs, riddles, proverbs,\r\nand legends. Volume after volume appeared, and there they all stand\r\nas a monument of German industry, though, unhappily, intelligible\r\nonly to Lettish speakers. Having lost his sight over his work, and\r\ngrowing very old, with his aged wife and grandchildren around him, he\r\ndetermined to write one more book and then depart in peace. The title\r\nof the book was “The Happy Life,” and hardly had he published it when\r\nthe peasants came to his church, ordered him to leave out the Tsar from\r\nhis prayers, attacked his house, shot his sexton, held eight rifles at\r\nhis daughter’s heart, burnt his library, smashed his china, trampled\r\non his harpsichord, and made a bonfire of his furniture in the garden,\r\nkindling it with his manuscripts. Thus he was driven out, blind, aged,\r\nand poor, to begin a new volume of a life which he thought was ending\r\nhappily.\r\n\r\n“But we do not regret the title of my book, do we, dear wife? We have\r\nnot lost our trust in the dear God,” he said, bending his tall, slim\r\nfigure to kiss the old lady’s hand.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered. “We have lost our best china, but our guest will\r\nkindly excuse it.”\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus conversing, the pastor of a neighbouring parish\r\nentered, a little excited over a scene in which he had just taken part.\r\nThere had been an execution in his village that morning, and it was his\r\nduty to conduct the funeral of the young revolutionist who was shot.\r\nFor some reason the officer in command had ordered a party of horse and\r\nfoot with two guns to attend the ceremony and prevent any disturbance.\r\n“The coffin and I were surrounded by soldiers along the whole route,”\r\nsaid the pastor; “and when we came to the grave, the people were kept\r\nthree hundred yards away. The result was that they could not hear a\r\nword of the sermon which I had prepared with special care for the\r\noccasion. As it was in Lettish, the soldiers did not understand it, and\r\nall my pains were entirely thrown away.”\r\n\r\nSo each suffered in his fashion.\r\n\r\nAll through the open country parties of cavalry went trotting from farm\r\nto farm. Infantry drove in sledges, holding their rifles ready. General\r\nOrloff had then made his headquarters at Segewold, some forty miles\r\nnorth of Riga, and obtaining a sledge there with a Lett driver who\r\nspoke German, I was able to travel far through the low hills and wooded\r\nvalleys where the troops were at their work. The ruins of ancient\r\ncastles built by the Prussian Orders are rather frequent in that\r\nneighbourhood, and the modern country houses which have taken their\r\nplace are especially fine--great mansions like our own “outposts of\r\nbarbarism,” some with gables and mullions, some with classic pediments\r\nand columns in the “Georgian style.” But all were empty now, and not\r\na sound arose even from the stables and barns. One great house, as\r\nfamous as any monastery for its liqueurs, had been burnt to a cinder of\r\nruin, and there was hardly a farm around which had not lost a father\r\nor son, hanged for burning it. The farms we passed appeared to be\r\nequally empty; but when the driver gradually discovered that I had no\r\ndirect concern for Russian Government or German landowners, he began\r\nto spread communications along the road by a system of signals and\r\ncries. Faces would then peer out from the entrances of fowl houses,\r\nor sudden questions would come from the depths of a holly bush. In\r\nthe quick conversations that followed I heard the word “Cossacks”\r\nconstantly repeated, for every mounted soldier is to them a Cossack,\r\nand the question they always asked was whether the soldiers were\r\ncoming. Too often they were coming. We had seen them behind us, or had\r\nwatched a party moving down a hill, or cautiously making their way\r\nthrough woods. The infantry in sledges were harder to distinguish; but\r\nthey were less numerous, and they went in obvious terror. Under their\r\nhouses some of the peasants had dug deep holes to hide in, and some\r\nhad taken to caverns in the sandstone hillsides, covered among the\r\nwoods. But it was chilly weather for that kind of life. The soldiers\r\nwere everywhere. In every parish a certain number of victims had to be\r\noffered up to create a salutary impression, and all I can hope is that\r\nour lonely little sledge, passing almost unobserved along the lanes,\r\nmay perhaps have saved one or two by its warnings. That it was allowed\r\nto pass unobserved must be put down to kindly fortune, for I had\r\napplied for the necessary permission to visit the country districts,\r\nbut had applied utterly in vain. I have often noticed that the agents\r\nof justice display a peculiar shyness about the presence of spectators\r\nwhen they are killing men and women as the law directs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there was, perhaps, too little reserve about another\r\nhabit practised by the officers in command--the habit of ordering\r\nexecutions by telephone in the presence of the condemned. In Riga I\r\nhad heard of instances, and they appeared to me to show a peculiarly\r\ncold-hearted brutality, though I do not quite understand why. The\r\ndriver told me of a similar case which had happened in Segewold.\r\nAfter the rapid court-martial and sentence, the officer rang up on\r\nthe telephone: “Hullo! Is that the sergeant? All right. Have a firing\r\nparty here six o’clock to-morrow morning. Three prisoners to be shot.\r\nSix men will be enough. No, better bring ten perhaps. Mind they’re not\r\nlate. Six o’clock to-morrow morning. Three prisoners. All right.” Then\r\nhe rang off, and the prisoners were led away. It was like ordering the\r\nfuneral lunch in the hearing of the sick.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to these things I may mention an occurrence that was\r\nthought humorous, and was known to every one in Riga at the time.\r\nIt concerned a young Lettish schoolmistress who was sentenced to be\r\nflogged. Not understanding either the sentence or the brutal orders\r\nand gestures of the soldiers, whose duty it was to carry it out, she\r\nthought she was to be violated, and that story was an inexhaustible\r\nsubject of mirth among the commercial and landowning classes in the\r\nRiga restaurants. I have heard it translated into four languages so\r\nthat no one present might miss the full humour of the situation.\r\n\r\nSo it went on. In the country the people died by hundreds. They were\r\nflogged, they were hanged, they were shot. Their wooden farmhouses were\r\nburnt to the ground. Their children were turned out in the winter to\r\nstarve. Men and women alike were slaughtered by hundreds, and no one\r\nhad pity on them. I heard no single word of pity or of understanding\r\nspoken in any language, and week after week the bloody assize went on.\r\n\r\nThank God, there were reprisals, however few. Soldiers on the march\r\nthrough the town moved in single file for fear of bombs, and even that\r\ndid not always save them. The assassinations of policemen upon the\r\nstreets averaged one or perhaps two a day. The police lived in terror,\r\nand as they went their rounds in groups of two or three, they were\r\nescorted by an equal number of soldiers with fixed bayonets. Continual\r\nalarms arose from every quarter of Riga; the reports of revolvers or\r\nrifles would suddenly be heard, and this way and that the people ran.\r\nTwo or three days after I arrived there was a gallant rescue from the\r\nvery police-station itself. At eight o’clock in the morning two women\r\ncame to the door with food for five prisoners who were lying under\r\nsentence of death for the assassination of a police officer named\r\nPorschetsky. As they were going away, eight or ten men entered. Some\r\nseized the police on duty, killing one and wounding two others who\r\nresisted, and four went to the cells and released all five prisoners,\r\nwho walked quietly in different directions down the streets and\r\nescaped, though without their hats. One of them was recaptured two days\r\nlater while foolishly tying on a false beard in a barber’s shop. His\r\nsister who was with him, fell on the floor, and clinging to the knees\r\nof the police implored for mercy. The barber fainted with excitement,\r\nand the man was dragged away and shot.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon a young boy passing my hotel was bayoneted to death\r\nby a soldier for refusing to halt at command. Whether he was another of\r\nthe five or simply did not hear the order, I did not discover. He was\r\nunder twenty, dark haired, with the clear and intellectual face that\r\ncharacterises the Lettish students, artists, and other revolutionaries\r\nof the towns.\r\n\r\nOf the same type was another boy who was shot the following Sunday\r\nmorning at nine o’clock just outside the castle wall. There were eight\r\nin the firing party. “One, two, three--fire!” said the sergeant, and\r\nthe boy fell like a dummy on the stage, to the edification of the\r\nearly churchgoers who crowded round to examine the body. And with that\r\ntypical scene in my mind I was obliged to take leave of the Baltic\r\nProvinces, marked in every economic map as one of the few fairly\r\nprosperous regions of the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                         THE PARTIES OF POLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the discussion of an English Education Bill, I suppose that\r\nupon the world’s surface you would not find such an atmosphere of\r\nenergetic pettiness and trivial virulence as in Warsaw. Not that the\r\nultimate aims of the chief combatants are petty, but that many natures\r\ntake so much more delight in clawing their friends over trifles than in\r\nuniting against the common enemy.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Poles in St. Petersburg, I have already described\r\na Polish restaurant there which was sharply divided by an invisible\r\nbut impassable line into two camps, both violently Polish, and both\r\nso hostile to each other that the girls of one would not speak or eat\r\nwith the girls of the other, nor even with the men. Warsaw displayed a\r\nsimilar division in almost every street. Very likely it is the price\r\nthat Poles pay for the strong individuality which has given them so\r\nmany poets, artists, and musicians. The consequence is that in Warsaw,\r\nthe parties are continually shifting, and grow like polyps by splitting\r\nthemselves into fractions, so that the political student, after weeks\r\nof labour, goes to bed one night happily conscious of having mastered\r\nthe situation at last, and wakes up in the morning to find the whole\r\nthing changed.\r\n\r\nBut before describing what I believe to have been the condition of\r\nPolish parties one post time on a February morning, it may be well to\r\nestimate the strength of the common enemy’s position, as one of the\r\nenemy’s leaders himself defined it. Of the three highest officials in\r\nPoland he was the most experienced in the country and spoke with the\r\ngreatest authority. Even the extra number of footmen who took my coat\r\nsymbolized a power of life and death.\r\n\r\n“Martial law,” he began at once, “will be unflinchingly maintained,\r\nat all events till the Duma meets. These Poles are an unreasonable,\r\nunpractical people, full of crazy notions. They need a strong hand.\r\nThey mistake kindness for fear. They must be firmly dealt with. They\r\nlike it really--in his heart every Pole likes it. Since we proclaimed\r\nmartial law last November there has been no disturbance. And for forty\r\nyears before that--ever since we crushed the Polish revolution in\r\n1864--order had reigned.”\r\n\r\nI smiled inwardly, remembering that well-worn quotation about the\r\norder that reigned in Warsaw, and I looked at the speaker with fresh\r\ninterest. I had often heard of him as the perfect type of the\r\nthorough-going reactionaries, the real old Russian bureaucrats,\r\nwho were fighting the revolution at the last ditch for their ideal\r\nof empire, their privileges, and their pay. A tall and shapely man\r\nof about fifty, diplomatically courteous and grave, he became the\r\nfurniture of the official palace very well, but in his round, bright\r\neyes I sometimes detected the alert and watchful look of a racoon\r\nwhen he confronts you suddenly in the forest. He afterwards described\r\nme to a friend as a terrible revolutionist, and as I remained almost\r\nsilent during the conversation, being overcome by the superiority of\r\nhis French, that showed a penetration which gave greater value to his\r\njudgments.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he repeated, “these Poles have always been an unreasonable and\r\nunpractical people, full of flighty notions. You may now divide them\r\ninto Nationalists and Socialists--both about equally absurd. I need\r\nnot speak of the Socialists and the nonsense they talk of equality and\r\nnationalization. They are the same everywhere. In Poland we found them\r\ndoing a certain amount of harm among the peasants; so we quartered\r\ntroops in the villages, and now the peasants have turned against the\r\nSocialists like other right-minded men. Indeed, the Jewish Bund is the\r\nonly troublesome Socialist body now left, and we are dealing with them.\r\nThey will tend to disappear.\r\n\r\n“The Nationalists are equally helpless. They make a mighty fuss about\r\nthe suppression of their language, but in our Empire we must have one\r\ncommon language, and it must be Russian. Then as to their Catholic\r\nreligion: the Poles are a singularly fanatical people. Their attachment\r\nto their superstitious rites is most extraordinary. Even the educated\r\nclasses are little better than fanatics in their religious beliefs.\r\nThey are incapable of any breadth of view, and if we gave the people\r\nthe chance, they would show themselves utterly intolerant of the\r\nOrthodox Church. They would insult and persecute our fellow-believers.\r\nSuch things we cannot allow, and we will not.\r\n\r\n“Nor can we yield to their talk about autonomy and separation. It is\r\nall very well for England to grant autonomy to her Colonies over the\r\nsea. She has not granted it to Ireland, and she does not grant it to\r\nIndia. We have not the least desire to become a powerless confederation\r\nlike Austria, in perpetual danger of disruption. That would be even\r\nworse than to become like Germany, continually hampered by her\r\nSocialists. Any kind of separation would mean immediate ruin to Poland\r\nand her industries. Russia, Siberia, and the Far East are her only\r\nmarkets. If she were separated from us, first she would starve, next\r\nshe would be swallowed up by Germany, and foolish as the Poles are,\r\nthey still have sense enough to hate the Germans more than they hate\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“It is true that in a weak moment our Government made concessions\r\nto Finland, and that has encouraged the Poles to hope for the same.\r\nBut we shall not be able to allow Finland to remain on a different\r\nfooting from the rest of the Empire. Those concessions must rapidly be\r\nwithdrawn. We shall very likely have to conquer Finland over again.\r\nThat would be an easy task, and need cause us no apprehension. All\r\nspecial rights in any part of the Empire must vanish, and the whole\r\nEmpire must be bound together into one. If we yield at any point, we\r\nmust yield in all, and that is impossible.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible for our own safety. Here in Poland, for instance,\r\nwe have to defend a frontier where there is no natural barrier to\r\nward off an attack by Germany. Even if we gave up Poland as far as\r\nthe Vistula, it would not help us. In these days a river is no real\r\nprotection in war; if the Vistula were a mountain chain, that would\r\nbe a different question. As it is, we must maintain our two parallel\r\nlines of fortresses in Poland, and especially the triangle of the three\r\nmain strongholds, of which Warsaw is one. The triangle is too large to\r\nbe surrounded, and it would secure us the time for mobilization. For\r\ncertainly we could not mobilize nearly so fast as Germany.\r\n\r\n“That is the plain truth of the situation. People talk about Russia’s\r\ninternal troubles, but they are not of any importance. It is mainly an\r\nagrarian question. The peasants think their land insufficient, because\r\nthey are too ignorant to cultivate it properly, and the redistribution\r\nof the land by the communes every twelve years--it used to be every\r\nyear--deprives them of the valuable sense of ownership. We must abolish\r\nthe communal system, institute private ownership in land, and plant\r\nseveral new colonies--in Siberia, for example. Then you will see\r\nthat Russia will easily regain her former condition of quietude and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n“And, as to Poland again, you will find that if the Duma meets, it will\r\nbe compelled to govern Poland exactly as the Autocracy has governed it\r\nin the past, and is governing it now.”\r\n\r\nIt was a frank and reasonable statement of the reactionary position,\r\nand, if once the bureaucrat’s estimate of government and of human\r\nnature be accepted, the position is easy to defend. Like most\r\nConservatives, the bureaucrats and reactionaries know pretty definitely\r\nwhat they mean, and what they do not want; for even a prophet may\r\nperhaps find it easier to see the past clearly than the future. To know\r\nthe object clearly is a great advantage in controversy, and in action\r\nit means victory, unless the enemy knows still more definitely what he\r\nintends to have. But in Poland there are so many intentions that the\r\nbattle for nationality and freedom is more than usually difficult.\r\n\r\nAt the back of all modern politics stands the workman, tending\r\nwith every decade to become the only kind of citizen that need be\r\nconsidered. We must suppose therefore that the various Polish parties\r\nwho are battling for nationality and freedom have the advancement of\r\nthe workman ultimately in view, and certainly there are few European\r\ncountries where his advancement is more obviously desirable. In\r\ncommerce, Poland has suffered more than any other part of Russia\r\nfrom the disasters of the last few years. About five years ago, the\r\ntime of ruin set in with a commercial depression, vaguely attributed\r\nto over-production. Hardly was trade recovering when the outbreak\r\nof the Japanese war checked every hope. Siberia and the Far East\r\nhad become, as my official rightly said, the chief markets for such\r\ngreat industrial centres as Warsaw and Lodz. Then suddenly all orders\r\nceased, the goods already despatched could neither be recovered nor\r\npaid for, and the railways were taken up by the army. Ordinary trade\r\ndropped, and only those firms could look for any profit which received\r\nGovernment orders for barbed-wire entanglements, empty shrapnel cases,\r\nand metals for field railways--“goods” which must be paid for by the\r\nstarving peasants, and might just as well have been sunk in the sea\r\nat once. Out of thirty-one ironworks, ten closed their gates, and the\r\nrest blew out half their furnaces. It is true, the iron industry is\r\nrather an artificial thing, which even in peaceful times lives chiefly\r\non Government patronage. For it has to import coke from Siberia, and\r\nore from Krivoy Rog in South Russia. But the losses in the iron trade\r\nwere equalled by disasters in other industries, and the only instance\r\nof success I heard of during the war was that the big chocolate works\r\nreceived large orders to supply officers at the front. It is not\r\nthe first time we have heard of “chocolate-cream soldiers.” Indeed,\r\nchocolate is taking the place of the Homeric onions as the food of\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\nThe war also ruined credit, and Polish trade lives on credit. Warsaw\r\ndepends entirely upon Berlin for money, and Berlin refused to lend.\r\nOn the top of the war came the strikes--political strikes, economic\r\nstrikes, general strikes, postal strikes. All through last year they\r\nwent on, and there was hardly a firm that did not lose from a third\r\nto a half of its work. The severity with which the strikes were put\r\ndown only increased the resentment of the working-classes, and the\r\npeople deliberately preferred general ruin to the continuance of former\r\nconditions, whether of government or industry.\r\n\r\nSuch was the outlook of workmen in the towns. But about eighty per\r\ncent. (something over 8,000,000) of the Poles are agriculturists, and\r\nnearly half of these have no land of their own, but are forced to\r\nwander round as labourers, some 200,000 of them going into East Prussia\r\nyearly for the harvest, and most of them working in towns from time\r\nto time. It is true that the peasants are slowly buying more and more\r\nland from the bankrupt old nobility, who used to own Poland, and were\r\nthe chief cause of her ruin as a nation. The average price they pay for\r\nthe land is from £5 to £6 an acre, and the average peasant holding is\r\nseventeen acres. But this division into plots is at present lowering\r\nthe standard of agriculture, and so things will go from bad to worse\r\ntill the peasant gains a little learning, and puts science into his\r\nprimitive methods. At present more than half of the populations cannot\r\nwrite or read, and the proportion of schools to the number of children\r\nis actually decreasing. In Warsaw alone there are 60,000 children for\r\nwhom there is no place in school, and the amount spent on education\r\nper head of the population is 6_d._, as compared with 9_s._\r\n7_d._ in Berlin. Yet the Poles justly boast themselves better\r\neducated and more intelligent than average Russians. In brains and\r\nWestern knowledge they are immensely in advance.\r\n\r\nThe population, which is thicker on the ground than in France,\r\nincreases very rapidly, and that is one of the reasons why wages in the\r\nlast ten years have remained stationary in Warsaw, though the cost of\r\nliving has doubled. In the country a farm labourer’s wage is 9_d._\r\na day. In the towns the unskilled workman gets about 14_s._ a\r\nweek, and the unskilled woman from 6_s._ to 12_s._. But a\r\nskilled workman, such as a weaver, will make £2 10_s._ or even £3\r\na week for nine hours’ work a day. The rent of two fairly good rooms\r\nwith kitchen, on the fourth floor, is from 4_s._ to 5_s._\r\na week. But owing to the large numbers of the unskilled, it is very\r\ncommon to find four families living in one room, and the standard\r\nof life, especially among the Polish Jews, who number 1,500,000 of\r\nthe population, is very low, as any Londoner may see by walking down\r\nWhitechapel. As usual, the Jews are regarded as the worst of all\r\nwork-people, though they make most money in dealing. On the other hand,\r\nthe overseers in mills, whether German or English, spoke very highly\r\nto me of the Poles as mechanics, especially of the girls. “When they\r\nwill work, these Poles are first-rate,” said an English manager in\r\na lace works. “But they are butterflies, all butterflies,” he added\r\nwith a sigh. “I sent my little boy to school here, and they taught him\r\nlanguages well, but unveracity better. So now I’ve sent him to England,\r\nwhere at least he’ll learn nothing.”\r\n\r\nIn the accounts I heard or read of Polish trade, two other points\r\nappeared to me unhappily characteristic. One was that Polish hides\r\nhave to be sold at a cheaper rate than their apparent value, because\r\nthey are scarred and spoilt by the cruelty with which the Polish\r\npeasants use their heavy whips. The same is true even of the pigs,\r\nin which Poland does an immense trade; both the skins and the bacon\r\nare deteriorated by the cruelty of the swineherds. The other point I\r\ndiscovered in a Consular Report, which noticed that in Poland there\r\nis a very large demand for antiquities--“family portraits, signet\r\nrings, blood-stained weapons, and so on”--and suggested that, though\r\nGermany has almost entirely ousted English trade from the country, an\r\nopening for romantic Birmingham goods might here be found. It certainly\r\nseems a needless sorrow that any one who desires a family portrait or\r\nblood-stained weapon should be without it.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it appears that the Polish parties have enough scope for\r\ntheir labours on behalf of the workmen and labourers, even without the\r\ninternecine intrigues and animosities with which they enliven their\r\ntask, like British sects battling for the Kingdom of Heaven. Among\r\nthe leading parties on the extreme right stands the solid phalanx of\r\nofficials and reactionaries; but it is not to be called Polish. It\r\nis manned from the 300,000 Russians who are distributed among the\r\n10,000,000 Poles. It is the party of “the Garrison.” For no Pole can\r\nbecome an official--not even a policeman--unless he is first thoroughly\r\nRussianised and joins the Orthodox Church, and even in Russia it\r\nis only the officials and priests who are genuinely reactionary on\r\nprinciple, because it is they who are fighting for their existence in\r\ntheir last dirty ditch.\r\n\r\nBut next to the reactionaries, though far removed, came a genuine\r\nPolish party, who called themselves sometimes Realists, sometimes\r\nConciliators, because they represented their aims as real or tangible\r\nthings, and they were willing to act as peacemakers between Government\r\nand people. They were the moderate Opportunists, the cautious\r\nbourgeoisie (if any Pole is cautious), and they looked to the Duma\r\nfor salvation by gradual reforms. Still, they would struggle, however\r\ngently, for autonomy, and, conscious of their own weakness in numbers,\r\nthey were willing to lend the weight of their intellectual powers\r\n(which they believed to be considerable) to any union of moderate\r\nNationalist parties.\r\n\r\nIn practical politics (if Polish politics ever became practical) the\r\nRealists, who were called a staff without an army, were expected\r\nto unite with the National Democrats, who were an army without a\r\nstaff. Certainly the National Democrats were numerous and confident.\r\nThey alone of all the Polish parties were doing what we should call\r\nelection work for the Duma; for though their meetings were forbidden\r\nby the Government, those who attended them were not necessarily shot.\r\nI was myself present at one of those meetings, held in an upper room\r\ndecorated with pictures of dead animals, and some seventy or eighty\r\ngentlemen were there, for the most part substantial and elderly. There\r\nwas something a little pathetic about the performance, for they had met\r\nto practise how to do it, and they reminded me of a class of dockers\r\nI once tried to teach writing in Poplar, because they had escaped\r\nthe School Board. It is now eighty years since there was anything in\r\nthe least like an election in Poland, and that was for the Polish\r\nParliament which preceded the revolution of 1831. The tradition of how\r\nto vote had died since then, and those few comfortable gentlemen in\r\nthe upper chamber were trying to recover it. Each received a pencil\r\nand a little square of blank paper, and after they had followed their\r\ninstructions to the best of their ability, the papers were collected\r\nand mistakes pointed out. As a first lesson in the nomination of\r\ncandidates, the result showed considerable promise, and the teacher,\r\nwho had studied in England, expressed much satisfaction at the progress\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe twelve wards into which Warsaw was divided had to choose eighty\r\nelectors between them, and upon these eighty fell the choice of the\r\ntwo members who were to represent Warsaw in the Duma. These two were\r\ncounted among the thirty-six who would stand for Poland as a whole. The\r\nJews, who make up a third part of Warsaw’s population, were the only\r\nformidable opponents to the National Democrats. But the Jews are nearly\r\nall Socialists, and as the Socialists had up to that time refused to\r\nrecognize the Duma or take any part in the elections, the National\r\nDemocrats expected to secure all the “college” of electors.\r\n\r\nTheir programme was more advanced than I should have supposed from the\r\nrather venerable appearance of their meeting. They aimed at complete\r\nPolish autonomy in a Russian Federation. They demanded the use of\r\nPolish in schools and law-courts; the appointment of Poles to all\r\noffices of local administration; complete local self-government for\r\ntowns and country districts; and some included the restoration of the\r\nPolish Parliament as it existed from 1813 to 1831. This programme\r\nwas obviously very much more Nationalist than Democratic, but, in\r\nspite of the demand for Home Rule, there was no intention whatever of\r\nbreaking away from Russia. My reactionary official was again right in\r\nsaying that the Poles, like the Baltic Provinces, would rather suffer\r\nunder Russia than under Germany. The one thing that ended the great\r\ngeneral strike was the cry purposely, though falsely, raised by the\r\nmasters, “The Prussians are coming!” Germans may think it difficult\r\nto understand, but, outside Germany, a certain pleasantness of manner\r\ncounts for something in the affairs of life, and very few people really\r\nenjoy being goaded along the regulation road to official perfection.\r\n\r\nNext to the National Democrats came the Progressive Democrats, who\r\nbridged the gulf from respectability to Socialism, like Mr. John Burns,\r\nlet us say, or practical leaders of his type. They were what we should\r\ncall extreme Radicals, but they liked to borrow the word “Fabians,”\r\nnot having yet discovered that the Fabian Society ceased to count in\r\nthe advance of thought or politics after the support its majority gave\r\nto the South African War. Like academic people among ourselves, they\r\nare fond of repeating that they demand evolution, not revolution,\r\nbut their opposition to the Government is nevertheless sincere, and\r\nmany of them were in prison. The gradual nationalization of the land,\r\nwith compensation but compulsory sale where an owner possesses over a\r\ncertain maximum, is a great point in their programme, and their aims\r\nin general are rather social than political, though they, too, demand\r\na Polish Parliament and a military system under which Polish recruits\r\nshall remain in Poland. Like the Socialists, they refused to take any\r\npart in the elections, because under martial law there could be no\r\nfreedom of choice. Otherwise, they would have formed the natural allies\r\nof the Constitutional Democrats elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe powerful party known as National or Polish Socialists came very\r\nnear to these. In fact, no one but a Pole could have discovered in\r\ntheir programmes any distinction calling for passionate antipathy. They\r\nfollowed the usual Socialistic lines, with Polish autonomy thrown in,\r\nand they also prided themselves on their practical or “real” policy.\r\n\r\nNext to them, but separated by the impassable abyss of family\r\nanimosity, came their bitterest enemies, the Social Democrats, with\r\ntheir usual maximum and minimum programmes, that require no further\r\ndefinition. For the Gospel of St. Marx upholds the doctrine of faith\r\nall the world over, and its canon allows no variation of circumstance\r\nor nationality. In Poland, perhaps, its followers show themselves a\r\nlittle more pedantic and superior than elsewhere, and it is their\r\nintolerance of every other form of progress which has done most to\r\nkeep the parties divided, and maintain the enemy in power. Possibly\r\nfor this reason, combined with the imprisonment of all their leaders,\r\nthey appeared, whilst I was in Warsaw, to have lost ground, in spite of\r\ntheir careful organization and superhuman rectitude.\r\n\r\nBelow them--far below them, they would say--came the Proletariat\r\nSocialists, the workman’s party, who refused all “truck” with\r\nstudents or lawyers, or any other members of the “Intelligenzia”\r\nand bourgeoisie. They were the extremists; thirty years ago they\r\nwould have been called Nihilists, though untruly. They preached\r\nrevolutionary violence of any kind, and took the immediate happiness of\r\nthe working man as their motive and rule in all conduct. Beyond that,\r\nthey possessed the immense advantage of being entirely free from all\r\ndoctrines, theories, and abstractions. For they held by the simple and\r\nobvious fact, that a certain amount of pleasure may be obtained from\r\nlife, and the working man does not get it.\r\n\r\nThere remains but one party of importance, but it is a little difficult\r\nto place it in rank with the rest. For the Bund is not specially a\r\nPolish party. As I have shown, it spreads through Kieff, Odessa,\r\nand all Southern Russia. But in Warsaw it is particularly strong,\r\nbecause, beyond all others, it is the Jewish party. In social aims it\r\nagrees with the Social Democrats, but its methods are more definite\r\nand more violent. In Warsaw, its members were at that time collecting\r\narms, organizing bands, and conducting propaganda in meetings that\r\nwere protected by armed groups. Their programme was to carry on\r\nthe revolution by a series of general strikes, combined with armed\r\ndemonstrations and attacks upon Government buildings or officials,\r\nand they looked forward to a general and violent insurrection of all\r\nSocialists in Russia. Obviously, the first care of such a party should\r\nbe to win over the enemy’s armed forces, for as long as the Russian\r\nGovernment could trust the army to do the slaughtering for them, a\r\nviolent insurrection was outside serious consideration. Accordingly,\r\nthe Bund was continually sending out agents to work among the soldiers.\r\nThese agents endeavoured to establish in the army a large society of\r\nmen, who should take an oath never to fire upon their fellow-citizens.\r\nThere were minor points--a demand for better treatment, a refusal to\r\nact as officers’ servants, or to serve outside their home district. But\r\nnot to fire on citizens was the main thing, and if once that pledge\r\ncould be imposed upon the Russian army as a whole, the Government, with\r\nall its frippery and all its brutality, would vanish in a week.\r\n\r\nI have already given my reasons for seeing little hope of such a\r\nsolution. Obedience is the easiest form of sloth, and as soon as you\r\nput a man into uniform you render obedience almost irresistible.\r\nFurther, a soldier demands pay, clothes, food, and hitherto there has\r\nexisted no definite power in Russia, except the Crown, to which he\r\ncould look for these necessities.\r\n\r\nBut it was no wonder the Government regarded the Bund as their most\r\ndangerous enemy in a hostile nation. Under the unpopular bywords\r\nof “Anarchist” and “Jew,” the members of the Bund were seized and\r\nexecuted without mercy or regret. Upon the river bank, half a mile\r\nnorth of the city, stands the great fortress called the Citadel. I\r\nhappened to see more of it than most travellers, for, by good luck, I\r\nmanaged one afternoon to penetrate far within the gates before I was\r\narrested. But still I could not identify Pavilion 10, where some six\r\nhundred political prisoners were then crowded together, nor the places\r\nof execution, where so-called Anarchist Jews were shot. The official\r\nnumber of the executed in the month then stood at only sixteen, but\r\nit was impossible to estimate the true figures, when the only form of\r\ntrial was a secret court-martial, and when fishermen on the Vistula\r\nreported, as they did while I was there, that they had seen bodies\r\nappearing through holes in the ice below the Citadel, with faces\r\nmutilated to prevent recognition.\r\n\r\nAs in the rest of Russia, all the prisons were so overcrowded that the\r\nprisoners were dying of filth and disease. The town prison in Warsaw\r\nhad four hundred politicals, and sixty of them were crammed into a room\r\nbuilt for twenty-five. But if only as a relief from the dreariness\r\nof futile party distinctions, let me end with the official statement\r\nconcerning two Jewesses, arrested as the accomplices of a man named\r\nGramen, who had been shot for manufacturing bombs. Governor-General\r\nSkallon gave it out that it went against his feelings of humanity to\r\nshoot women, and accordingly he offered to appeal to the Tsar himself\r\non behalf of these two, if they would only promise never to take part\r\nin the revolution again. They both replied that if they were ever\r\nreleased, they would fling themselves into the movement with more\r\nenthusiasm than ever. So both were shot. And that one solid instance\r\nof invincible heroism proves that even Poland, in spite of all her\r\ndivisions and abstractions and intrigues, is not beyond the hope of\r\nliberty, since even in the wilderness of her parties that kind of\r\ncourage is seen to blossom.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: 1905\r\n\r\n  1906\r\n\r\n   From _Jupel_ (_Sulphur_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                         THE DRAMA OF FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen for a time I left Russia in February, the powers of reaction were\r\nat their highest, and at such a moment it might well seem absurd to\r\nspeak of the dawn, for the ancient darkness of Russia appeared again\r\nto have closed in upon the land. In looking back upon the things I had\r\nwitnessed, they naturally presented themselves to me as the scenes of\r\na great drama, in which the old Titans and demigods of humanity played\r\nfrom behind strange masks, compelled by the rival immortals of Freedom\r\nand Oppression, whose voices could at times be heard and their forms\r\nalmost seen, while the journalists of Europe chimed in with a chorus\r\nof alternately sympathetic comment. But there was no doubt that, as\r\nin all great dramas, the Protagonist had become involved in the toils\r\nof evil, and that, as far as worldly success went, a tragic fate was\r\noverwhelming him.\r\n\r\nWhen first I arrived in the country, the air was still radiant with\r\nhope. It is true that the early flush had a little faded; the joyful\r\nintoxication of the October Manifesto was passing off, and people\r\nwere beginning to realize that freedom is not a thing to depend on any\r\nman’s words. Liberty and despotism were hanging in the balance, and\r\nthe dull weights of habit and force were pressing down their scale.\r\nBut exiles were returning, prisoners were released, the Press was\r\nfree. Great public halls sounded to unaccustomed words of liberty, and\r\nthe Strike Committee, which had shaken the strongest tyranny of the\r\nworld, was still the strongest power in the country. The Government\r\nstood uncertain and afraid. It felt itself confronted by an unknown\r\nand incalculable adversary, the more terrible for its vagueness--an\r\nadversary that out of unregarded obscurity had struck one sudden and\r\nparalyzing blow and now lay coiled up in its lurking place, only\r\nwaiting for the fit moment to strike that blow again.\r\n\r\nIn its distress the Government looked round for help. It looked to the\r\nrailways to carry its troops, and the trains ceased running. It looked\r\nto the post and telegraph to bear its orders, and the wires were cut,\r\nand the letters lay in heaps. It looked to the army, and from all\r\nsides came the tale of mutiny; to the navy, and it heard the flames\r\nof Odessa, the flames of Kronstadt, and the big guns of Sevastopol.\r\nIt looked to the Press, and it found even the ancient supporters of\r\nTsardom were beginning to hint at reforms. The very Ministers were\r\nunderstood to speak a little uncertainly of autocracy, and whenever a\r\nreporter was within hearing, the chief of them all kept muttering, “I\r\nam a bit of a Liberal myself.” So the Government stood uncertain, in\r\nthe uneasy position of an animal which does not know whether it is to\r\nbe hound or hare upon the course.\r\n\r\nThat we may call the first act of the drama, but when the second\r\nact opened, the powers of evil were seen more actively insinuating\r\nthemselves into the course of tragedy. Their activity took the form of\r\na plot which can be easily unravelled from the course of the events\r\nupon the stage. In order to involve the Russian people in the doom of\r\ntragedy, they may be represented as thus whispering to the leaders of\r\nthe Government:--\r\n\r\n“The first thing is to secure the Army, by promises of better food\r\nand pay. Having secured the Army, you may goad the people to open\r\nresistance by attacking them without warning. When they rise it will\r\nbe easy to stamp them down, and under the excuse of their violent\r\nrevolution, you can silence the Press, you can close the meetings, you\r\ncan shoot or imprison the leaders, you can choke the voice of freedom\r\nin troublesome districts like Finland, the Baltic Provinces, Poland,\r\nand the Caucasus. By controlling the elections you can secure exactly\r\nthe kind of Duma you want. You may then appeal to Europe to admire both\r\nyour power and your progress, and all Europe will join in applause.\r\nThe chorus of journalists which used to sing ‘The Dawn of Freedom,’\r\nwill chant warnings to rebellion and the triumph of order over chaos.\r\nYour object will then be gained, for you can obtain the money that is\r\nthe one thing needful for your existence. England will again recognize\r\nyour credit. France will contribute the interest on her own loans, and\r\nGermany will recognize a Government endued with just about as much\r\nliberty as her William likes.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the suggestions of the powers of evil, and the Russian\r\nGovernment is not to be blamed for accepting them gladly. That unhappy\r\nlittle group of royalties, Grand Dukes, landlords, officials, and\r\npriests, were fighting, not merely for an obsolete ideal of State, but\r\nfor their very existence, for their daily pleasures, their daily bread,\r\nfor a decent roof over their heads and a decent table over their legs.\r\nIt was no child’s play for them, since all they valued was at stake,\r\nand the only wonder is that they were clever enough to understand the\r\nwhispered promptings of the powers who spoke on behalf of Oppression,\r\nan ancient and venerable god. If any Russian statesman or general or\r\nadmiral had displayed the strategic skill in dealing with the Japanese\r\nthat the Government now revealed in suppressing the liberties of their\r\nown country, Russia would have been spared one of the most shameful and\r\noverwhelming disasters in history.\r\n\r\nBut in following these promptings, the Government succeeded at every\r\npoint. The general strike was the only genuine weapon the people\r\nhad--an irresistible weapon, provided it was used simultaneously and\r\nseldom. The Government drove the leaders to use it piecemeal and often.\r\nThey confiscated the strike funds to starve the women and children,\r\nthey employed hunger and Cossacks to shake the determination of the\r\nmen. By bombarding a committee, they drove the revolutionists to build\r\nthe Moscow barricades before the movement was ripe and while the\r\nother cities remained inactive. They discovered the fighting weakness\r\nof freedom, and the entire security with which men in uniform can\r\nbe trusted to kill at the command of those who feed and pay them.\r\nThey stamped down the rising in blood. They shot all the leading\r\nrevolutionists, they imprisoned all the suspects, they hewed the\r\ninsignificant in pieces. They applauded the murderers of doctors who\r\nwere saving the wounded. They executed schoolboys for believing better\r\nforms of government possible, and they handed over schoolgirls to\r\nsoldiers to be flogged.\r\n\r\nIn all this they proved themselves entirely wise, for they gained\r\ntheir end. The moment that the Moscow rising was crushed, troops were\r\nlet loose with confidence upon Poland, the Caucasus, and the Baltic\r\nProvinces. Preparations were made for the reconquest of Finland.\r\nExecutions became general throughout the Empire. The prisons were\r\ncrammed, and typhus finished what the rifle and hang-rope left undone.\r\nThe elections for the Duma were prepared under police supervision, and\r\nLiberal candidates removed to prison. Liberal meetings were forbidden,\r\nLiberal papers suppressed. The chorus of European journalists chanted\r\nthe overthrow of rebellion and the restoration of order. And at last,\r\nas the crowning reward of a faithlessness and cruelty so cleverly\r\ndisplayed, the deficit of over £80,000,000 was freely supplied by a\r\nfresh European loan, to which the so-called Liberal Powers of France\r\nand England were the chief contributors. There is something divine in\r\nsuccess so unquestioned and unassailable, nor can we wonder that its\r\nworship is almost universal. In the autumn of 1905, no one thought\r\nit possible for the Russian Government to raise another loan for its\r\nexistence, unless under guarantees of liberty and popular control.\r\nBut the Government quietly set about the work of slaughter, and when\r\nthat was finished held out a bloody hand to Europe; and Europe kissed\r\nthe bloody hand reverently, and filled it with gold. In the spring of\r\n1906, a loan of £90,000,000 was subscribed without question, and upon\r\na triumphant tableau of Oppression reinstated and Evil enriched the\r\ncurtain fell. In the distance the spirits that attend on Freedom were\r\nfaintly heard bewailing her defeat.\r\n\r\nUnder large and shadowy symbols, the powers of human history may thus\r\nbe imagined to move upon their stage, and it is much easier to conceive\r\ntheir great abstractions than to realize the life or sufferings of one\r\nman or woman out of the millions of human beings, compared to whom\r\nall principles of freedom, government, or justice are but unstable\r\nvisions of the mind. It is in realizing solid and visible things that\r\nthe imagination fails. I have seen a few peasants starving on potatoes\r\nwarmed with straw, while they had sold their corn to Europe before it\r\nwas reaped, so as to pay for defeated armies, sunken battleships, a\r\nbloodthirsty police, and the pleasures of landowners in St. Petersburg.\r\nI have seen a few, but the imagination refuses to picture the millions\r\non millions like them, who are actually now existing. I have seen a\r\nfew tattered soldiers from the war draggling into Moscow at last,\r\nbegging for farthings, squatting on the curb-stones or murmuring\r\nvacantly to themselves, “Alive and home; alive and home!” I have seen\r\na few, but there were at least five hundred thousand of them still to\r\ncome--starving, tattered, mutinous, broken with terror and distress.\r\nI have seen a few work-people in their homes--scant of food, empty of\r\ncomfort, and crowded with human beings--but there are millions like\r\nthem. A few people I knew were shot, many were imprisoned; but there\r\nare thousands whose sons and lovers and friends have been shot, and\r\nthousands on thousands who are themselves in prison. I have heard\r\nand read of girls being flogged; but there are hundreds of lovers\r\nand brothers and fathers who have known the girls that were flogged,\r\nand have seen them come back tortured and shamed from the soldiers’\r\nhands. The picture of such things indefinitely repeated throughout a\r\nvast Empire becomes like the nightmare of a madman, and before such\r\nbare realities the imagination falls helpless. If we wished to be\r\ncharitable, we might say that this is why Frenchmen and Englishmen\r\ncould still be found to bolster up the bloodthirsty tyranny with\r\na loan, and no shout of laughter arose when Witte still went on\r\nmurmuring, “I am a bit of a Liberal myself,” and the Tsar telegraphed\r\nto England that he was meditating a new Peace Conference at the Hague.\r\n\r\nSo the triumph of reaction appeared to be complete: it seemed assured\r\nby the mere immensity of its horror, and the returned exiles admitted\r\nthat in the worst days of their youth Russia had never suffered as she\r\nwas suffering now. Yet I suppose that no single revolutionary in the\r\ncountry abandoned hope or contemplated peace. If there is something\r\ndiscouraging in the Russian passive endurance, it has its compensation\r\nin a slow but unwavering persistence in rebellion. In spite of all the\r\nwinter’s executions and imprisonment, I doubt if there was one good\r\nrebel the less in spring than in autumn, and revolutionists of all\r\ntypes were now drawn together by that just and savage indignation\r\nwhich is the strongest bond of union. The bureaucrats of Tsardom had\r\nstamped for themselves a red surface on which their little circle\r\nmight continue to live a while longer; but the revolution was boiling\r\nunderneath, and even they could not be deaf to the hum and rumble of\r\nits working. In such mood, and amid such hopes and fears, the advent of\r\nthe long-promised Duma was awaited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DIARY OF EVENTS\r\n\r\n   In January, M. Durnovo, as Minister of the Interior, was freed\r\n   from the supervision of Count Witte, and made responsible only\r\n   to the Tsar.\r\n\r\n   Two main subjects were prominent in Russian affairs during the\r\n   following weeks--finance and the elections for the Duma.\r\n\r\n   In the middle of January, Shipoff, the Minister of Finance, had\r\n   issued the official estimates for the Budget of 1906, showing an\r\n   expenditure of £251,000,000 and a deficit of £48,000,000. The\r\n   main items of the revenue were--\r\n\r\n                                            £\r\n    Direct taxes                        15,000,000\r\n    Indirect taxes                      42,000,000\r\n    State monopolies                    64,000,000\r\n    State lands                         59,000,000\r\n\r\n   The main items of expenditure were--\r\n\r\n                                            £\r\n    Interest on loans                   34,000,000\r\n    War Office                          38,000,000\r\n    Navy                                10,000,000\r\n    Ministry of Finance                 34,000,000\r\n       „     „  Interior                13,000,000\r\n       „     „  Communications          48,000,000\r\n       „     „  Education                4,000,000[6]\r\n\r\n   But besides these items of ordinary expenditure there remained--\r\n\r\n                                            £\r\n    Extraordinary War disbursements     40,000,000\r\n    Famine relief                        3,000,000\r\n\r\n   The true deficit for the year amounted to at least £80,000,000,\r\n   and would probably be nearer £90,000,000. In spite of the large\r\n   foreign loans the gold reserve had fallen from £106,000,000 in\r\n   February, 1904, to £94,000,000 in December, 1905, and the paper\r\n   in circulation had risen from £59,000,000 to £143,000,000 in the\r\n   same period.\r\n\r\n   On February 21st the trial of Lieutenant Schmidt for the mutiny\r\n   at Sevastopol began in Odessa. On March 3rd he was sentenced to\r\n   be hanged.\r\n\r\n   On February 26th, an Imperial Ukase fixed May 10th as the date\r\n   for the Duma, the total number of members being 476, of which\r\n   412 would represent European Russia, exclusive of Poland.\r\n\r\n   On March 5th, the elections began among the peasants of the St.\r\n   Petersburg province.\r\n\r\n   On March 6th, an Imperial Manifesto was published reorganizing\r\n   the old Council of the Empire, and further limiting the powers\r\n   of the Duma. The Council of the Empire was now to consist of\r\n   an equal number of elected and nominated members. The elected\r\n   members would represent the Zemstvos, the Holy Synod, the\r\n   Universities, the Bourse, the nobility, and the landowners\r\n   of Poland. Both the Council and the Duma would be convoked\r\n   and prorogued annually, and have equal legislative powers in\r\n   introducing bills, but every measure must be passed by both the\r\n   Council and the Duma before it could be laid before the Tsar.\r\n\r\n   When the Duma was not sitting the Committee of Ministers might\r\n   conduct legislation not involving any change in the fundamental\r\n   laws of the Empire.\r\n\r\n   The _Molva_ (formerly the _Russ_) published an account\r\n   of terrible tortures inflicted on Vincentz Siecska and Edmund\r\n   Kempski by M. Grun, chief of detectives in Warsaw, to make\r\n   them confess and sign false documents. This paper had already\r\n   told how two officers had tortured and outraged the schoolgirl\r\n   Spiridonova arrested for complicity in the assassination of the\r\n   Tamboff Vice-Governor. One of the officers was afterwards found\r\n   shot on the road.\r\n\r\n   On March 19th, Lieutenant Schmidt was shot.\r\n\r\n   On March 20th, the Mutual Credit Society’s Bank in Moscow was\r\n   forcibly robbed of £85,000.\r\n\r\n   At this time several battalions and mountain batteries were\r\n   sent into Finland as though for the reconquest of the country\r\n   and the destruction of its restored liberties. They were,\r\n   however, withdrawn, probably owing to representations made to\r\n   the Government that an attack upon Finland at such a moment\r\n   would prove an obstacle to the much-needed loan from France and\r\n   England.\r\n\r\n   The victory of the Constitutional Democrats in the Duma\r\n   elections from March 28th onward, was greeted with satisfaction\r\n   by nearly all the Progressive parties. At Odessa on April\r\n   1st, all the sixty-six candidates selected by the workmen\r\n   of sixty-six factories were imprisoned, and the authorities\r\n   directed the workmen to choose reactionaries.\r\n\r\n   The remains of Lieutenant Schmidt were dug up and scattered in\r\n   the sea because his grave was becoming a place of pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n   On April 4th, it was found that the Constitutional Democrats\r\n   had carried every electoral seat in St. Petersburg, even in the\r\n   official and commercial wards. The _Molva_ called upon\r\n   France not to defy the verdict of the Russian nation by helping\r\n   the present Administration with money. The paper was again\r\n   suppressed, but reappeared as _The Twentieth Century_.\r\n\r\n   M. Kokovtsoff again set out for Berlin and Paris in the hope of\r\n   negotiating a new loan.\r\n\r\n   At the elections in Moscow nearly all the 40,000 electors went\r\n   to the poll, and 70 per cent. voted for the Constitutional\r\n   Democrats.\r\n\r\n   About April 10th, Germany refused to share in the proposed\r\n   new Russian loan, chiefly owing to Russia’s service to France\r\n   during the Algeciras Conference. Germany already holds about\r\n   £140,000,000 of Russian stock.\r\n\r\n   France, however, agreed to advance £46,000,000 out of a new\r\n   five per cent. loan of £90,000,000 at the price of 88. Austria\r\n   advanced £6,600,000, Holland a little over £2,000,000, and\r\n   England a little over £13,000,000.\r\n\r\n   The arrangement was concluded at Easter, April 14th, and nearly\r\n   sufficed to cover Russia’s deficit for the current year. The\r\n   Russian Minister of Finance proposed to meet the increased\r\n   charge by further indirect taxation, especially on gas,\r\n   electricity, and candles.\r\n\r\n   On April 23rd, a most brilliant rescue of ten “politicals” was\r\n   effected at Warsaw. Some men in police-officers’ uniform called\r\n   at the Pavia-street prison in the early morning and demanded\r\n   the prisoners in order to transfer them to the Citadel, which,\r\n   as I have explained above, stands besides the Vistula a short\r\n   distance north of the town.\r\n\r\n   Later in the day the police van and driver were found in a\r\n   garden upon the outskirts, the prisoners having escaped together\r\n   with their comrades who carried out the rescue.\r\n\r\n   On May 1st, it was definitely announced, not for the first\r\n   time, that Witte had resigned his position as President of the\r\n   Committee of Ministers, and an entire change of Cabinet was\r\n   rumoured.\r\n\r\n   For about a week before this, rumours of Father Gapon’s death,\r\n   either by assassination or suicide, had become frequent and\r\n   fairly definite in Russia. His fate was attributed to the double\r\n   part he had long been accused of playing as an agent of the\r\n   Government. The St. Petersburg press have published an anonymous\r\n   pamphlet received from Berlin, in which the treacheries are\r\n   enumerated for which it was said he has been condemned and\r\n   executed.\r\n\r\n   On May 2nd, M. Durnovo, with the approaching Duma in view, sent\r\n   instructions to the Governors of the Provinces to prevent the\r\n   peasant delegates from travelling with Constitutional Democrats.\r\n   News from Poland reported the election of the National party’s\r\n   candidates.\r\n\r\n   On May 4th, Count Witte, ex-Prime Minister, was thanked and\r\n   decorated, and M. Durnovo resigned the post of Minister of the\r\n   Interior for that of Secretary of State, retaining the dignity\r\n   of Senator and member of the Council of Empire. M. Goremykin,\r\n   an expert in agrarian and peasant questions, was appointed\r\n   Premier, and the opening of the Duma was announced for May\r\n   10th. The Congress of Constitutional Democrats assembled in St.\r\n   Petersburg, have published the programme of their party.\r\n\r\n   On May 6th, Admiral Dubasoff, Governor-General of Moscow was\r\n   wounded by a bomb when returning from the Uspenski Cathedral.\r\n   The attempt took place outside the carriage entrance to the\r\n   Government House in Moscow. The bomb-thrower is supposed to have\r\n   been killed by the explosion. Partial strikes in Poland, Kieff,\r\n   Moscow, and St. Petersburg were reported, and agrarian disorders\r\n   said to continue.\r\n\r\n   General Jeoltanowski, Governor of Ekaterinoslav, was\r\n   assassinated by six unknown men, who fired their revolvers\r\n   at him and then escaped. The station of Schlok at the Tukkum\r\n   Junction was attacked by fifteen armed men, who killed five\r\n   officials and ransacked the safes of post-office and station.\r\n\r\n   On May 7th, the Tsar issued a Ukase affecting the Fundamental\r\n   Laws, and a meeting of the Imperial Economic Society of St.\r\n   Petersburg was dispersed by police.\r\n\r\n   May 8th, the New Fundamental Laws, the last work of the\r\n   Witte-Durnovo Cabinet and the old State Council, were published.\r\n   These laws, which the Duma cannot alter, proclaim the unity of\r\n   the Empire and the language, including Finland in the Empire\r\n   under special institutions, but making no mention of Poland.\r\n   The powers of the Tsar as Autocrat were to include the sole\r\n   right of proposing changes in the Fundamental Laws to the State\r\n   Council and the Duma; also the right of veto, the appointment\r\n   of the Executive, the ministers and the judges, the decision of\r\n   peace and war, and the command of the army and navy. Freedom\r\n   of speech, meeting or union, together with inviolability of\r\n   person and house were granted, but only “under established\r\n   legal conditions.” Ordinary laws could not be passed without\r\n   the consent of the Tsar and both Houses, but the Tsar might\r\n   promulgate special laws and declare various parts of the Empire\r\n   to lie under martial law. The Council of Ministers, too, might\r\n   promulgate special temporary laws, with the Tsar’s consent. The\r\n   State Council and the Duma were to meet annually, but could be\r\n   dismissed at any time by the Tsar. Their powers were not to\r\n   extend over the public debt or over the expenses of the Court\r\n   and Ministry. War taxes might be raised without the consent\r\n   of the Duma, and so might foreign loans. The decrees of the\r\n   Tsar were to be countersigned by one of the ministers, but as\r\n   each minister was declared responsible to the Tsar alone, this\r\n   concession was meaningless.\r\n\r\n   It was at once obvious that the elective body being deprived\r\n   of all control over the expenditure, the Executive and their\r\n   action, hardly any democratic element was left in the new\r\n   Constitution, except the right of protest without the power to\r\n   make the protest effective.\r\n\r\n   Some of the new ministers were officially announced: M.\r\n   Stishinsky, for Agriculture; M. Stcheglovitoff, for Justice;\r\n   M. Kaufman, for Education; and M. Schwanebach as Imperial\r\n   Comptroller.\r\n\r\n   A number of repressive measures against workmen have been\r\n   initiated by the management of various State works in St.\r\n   Petersburg, and the workmen have laid their grievances before\r\n   the peasant deputies in St. Petersburg who meet daily at the\r\n   house of M. Aladin.\r\n\r\n   Another meeting of the Economical Society to consider the\r\n   agrarian question, which was attended by many members of the\r\n   Duma, was dispersed by the police. M. Stolypin was named as\r\n   Minister of the Interior, and M. Alexander Isvolsky, Minister at\r\n   the Danish Court, has been recalled to take office as Minister\r\n   of Foreign Affairs in M. Goremykin’s Cabinet. M. Isvolsky is\r\n   credited with a sound and independent judgment. He was a strong\r\n   opponent of the war with Japan.\r\n\r\n   On May 9th, the Congress of the Constitutional Democrats\r\n   closed with an impassioned speech from Professor Miliukoff,\r\n   who declared the publication of the decree on the Fundamental\r\n   Laws to be a direct challenge to the nation. A resolution was\r\n   unanimously adopted declaring the Fundamental Laws to be a\r\n   flagrant violation of the Manifesto of October 30th.\r\n\r\n   A Peasant Parliamentary Party formed, numbering 129 members, all\r\n   in favour of the transfer of lands to the agricultural labourers.\r\n\r\n   The Tsar and Tsaritsa with their children left Tsarkoe Selo for\r\n   Peterhof.\r\n\r\n   The opening of the Duma was declared a public holiday, but all\r\n   demonstrations except religious services and street decorations\r\n   were strictly forbidden. The Semenovsky Regiment, so active in\r\n   the Moscow massacre, were chosen to guard the Palace, and all\r\n   the hospitals ordered to prepare for eventualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                         THE FIRST PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 10th of May had long been announced as the official birthday of\r\nRussian freedom, but every one was astonished when the birth actually\r\ntook place, and the officials were the most astonished of all. Stars\r\nand omens were unpropitious. The astrologers muttered of a secret\r\nand violent influence, already blighting the future hope before it\r\nbreathed. At the door was sitting an obscure and gigantic form with\r\nhands ready to throttle its earliest cry; and in the heavens, Orion’s\r\nsword, with point directed at the house of birth, was seen hanging by a\r\nsingle hair.\r\n\r\nIt required no divination to prophesy evil. Every art of provocation\r\nhad been used by the pensioners of violence to arouse a popular\r\noutbreak, so that in the name of order the people’s hopes might again\r\nbe thwarted. Martial law was maintained, and meetings were suppressed.\r\nOnly on the Tuesday night before the fateful Thursday, I visited the\r\nhall of the Free Economic Society for old acquaintance’ sake, because\r\nthe Strike Committee used to meet there, and sat among a peaceful\r\naudience of Constitutional Democrats and peasant members of the Duma,\r\nlistening to a statistical discourse on the agrarian question. Suddenly\r\na measured tramp was heard outside, thirty armed police forced their\r\nway into the crowded hall, and their officer declared the meeting\r\nclosed. White-haired Annensky, the club’s aged President, famous\r\nequally for learning and imprisonment, vainly recited the Society’s\r\nstatute of freedom, granted by Catherine II. herself. Speakers and\r\naudience, Members of Parliament, men and women alike, were driven\r\nout into the street, and in the name of the law we were commanded to\r\nlearn nothing further about the comparative statistics of agricultural\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\nThe change of Ministry during the previous week was claimed as\r\nan advantage by both sides. The removal of Witte and Durnovo\r\nsimultaneously at least made the assembly of the Duma possible, and the\r\nappointment of Goremykin as Premier was greeted even by many Liberals\r\nas a harmless and natural thing, just as in England it is harmless\r\nand natural to make a lord chairman of an agricultural show. On the\r\nother hand, it was seen that the new Ministers as a body belonged\r\nto the familiar old gang of bureaucrats, trained in the routine of\r\nofficialdom, and untouched by the realities of wider life. Finally,\r\nthe publication of the new version of “Fundamental Laws” only three\r\ndays before the Duma met was clear evidence that the party of reaction\r\nstill controlled the hesitating Tsar; for as long as those Fundamental\r\nLaws remained above change and above discussion, the power promised to\r\nthe people--the power that we call freedom--must inevitably continue\r\nineffectual as an infant spirit in limbo.\r\n\r\nSo the omens of freedom’s birth were dark; but omens are usually dark\r\nin Russia, and when the expected morning came, the church bells set\r\nup a famous clanging, and the beautiful city of St. Petersburg woke\r\nlight-hearted as usual in the midst of her perils. For the security of\r\nthe despotism every precaution had been taken. The palace arrangements\r\nhad been made by Trepoff himself, whose influence in the Imperial\r\nhousehold remained unabated. The deep and brilliant river ran silent\r\nand empty of traffic, while up its course the Tsar was spirited\r\nback to the city which had not known him since Bloody Sunday. All\r\nthe approaches to the Winter Palace were barred from dawn. The two\r\nnearest bridges over the Neva were closed. Troops were drawn across\r\nthe neighbouring streets. Bodies of variegated Cossacks and Guards,\r\ntheir horses bright with scarlet cloths, stood patient for hours upon\r\nthe vast and stony square before the palace doors. No common eye might\r\ngain a glimpse of the glory to be revealed. No cabman brought a duke\r\nwithout displaying a special green ticket in his hat. For days before,\r\nthe most elaborate system of coupons and signatures and photographs\r\nfor identification had been organized with infinite effort to prevent\r\nany dreadful occurrence. Yet when the moment came, no one consulted\r\nthe nice photographs with which I had freely supplied the palace, and\r\nI walked in far more easily than its owner. I have often noticed that\r\ndespotism affords these little advantages over decent government.\r\n\r\nAs the scene of the day’s first ceremony, Trepoff had chosen the\r\nlarge Coronation Hall, constructed with columns of genuine marble--so\r\nfew things are genuine in these palaces--and decorated with gold\r\nand crimson hideousness, to which all Emperors are obliged to grow\r\naccustomed. At the end of the hall, upon a few low steps, stood a\r\nrather old gilded throne. Over it was thrown a robe of ermine and\r\nyellow stuff in studied negligence, and round it stood four little\r\ngilded camp-stools. A praying-desk and a table, both covered with\r\ngold cloth, were placed in the middle of the inlaid floor, and some\r\npriests or deacons carried in the miraculous Icon, representing the\r\nhead of Christ, from the little old palace of Peter the Great. But\r\nwhen they had set it on the praying-desk they found it was so dusty,\r\nor had been so much kissed of late, that they had to spend the leisure\r\ntime in polishing it up with a fairly clean handkerchief. Beside them\r\nwas presently drawn up a choir of men and boys, all dressed in long\r\ncassocks of crimson and gold to match the furniture.\r\n\r\nMeantime the new State Council (or Council of Empire) had begun to\r\narrive and gather on the low platform constructed down the side of\r\nthe hall to the right of the throne. Senators also came in brilliant\r\nscarlet and gold, past and present Ministers with long beds of\r\ngold-lace flowers and foliage down their coats, a whole school of\r\nadmirals (if one may borrow a marine phrase from the porpoise), a\r\nradiant company of Field Marshals and generals in blue or white cloth\r\nwith gold or silver facings and enormous epaulettes, and the members of\r\nthe Holy Synod in the panoply of holiness. Soon the entire platform was\r\nfull of uniforms, and on the breast of each uniform gleamed stars and\r\ncrosses and medals, a few of which were gained by service in foreign or\r\ncivil war. Sometimes one could only hope that the hero would live to\r\nwin no more distinction, since there was no more room for orders, so\r\ngreat had been the wisdom or courage of the heart that beat below.\r\n\r\nBy some mistake, three peasant deputies, in high top-boots, with\r\nleather belts round their long Sunday coats, entered among all this\r\nbrilliance, contemplated it as though working out its value in grain,\r\nand then were hurriedly conducted away by a being with a queer gold\r\ncrook. But they were only a few minutes wrong in the programme, for\r\ndirectly afterwards all the Duma members came trooping in--sturdy\r\npeasants in homespun cloth, one Little Russian in brilliant purple with\r\nbroad blue breeches, one Lithuanian Catholic bishop in violet robes,\r\nthree Tartar Mullahs with turbans and long grey cassocks, a Balkan\r\npeasant in white embroidered coat, four Orthodox monks with shaggy\r\nhair, a few ordinary gentlemen in evening dress, and the vast body of\r\nthe elected in the clothes of every day.\r\n\r\nAll down the left side of the hall they ranged themselves, about four\r\nhundred and sixty of them altogether; for, at the last moment, all\r\nhad consented to come, though many of the peasants and Constitutional\r\nDemocrats had threatened to stay away, in protest against the\r\nFundamental Laws. There they stood, confronting the brilliant crowd\r\nacross the polished floor, and it was easy to see in them the symbol\r\nof the new age which now confronts the old and is about to devour it.\r\nShining with decorations and elaborately dressed in many colours, on\r\nthe one side were the classes who so long have drained the life of the\r\ngreat nation they have brought to the edge of ruin. Pale, bald, and\r\nfat, they stood there like a hideous masquerade of senile children,\r\nhardly able to realize the possibility of change. But opposite to them\r\nthronged the people--young, thin, alert, and sunburnt, with brown and\r\nhairy heads, dressed like common mankind, and straining for the future\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nIn that sharp contrast between obsolete failure and coming hope lay the\r\nonly significance of that palatial scene, unless a dim significance\r\nstill lurked in the dozen Byzantine bishops and metropolitans, who,\r\nin stiff gold and domed mitres, tottered up the space between the\r\nconfronting ages, and embraced each other’s hoary beards with holy\r\nkisses. They had hardly been brought into line before the altar when a\r\nsudden hush was felt by all, and far away was heard the melancholy and\r\nbeautiful Russian Hymn. It heralded the approach of the regalia, and\r\npresently there entered the golden sceptre and the golden orb, the seal\r\nof bronze, and the diamond crown, each reposing upon a velvet cushion\r\nand escorted by golden staves and the flag of Empire and the big gilt\r\nsword. Then at last I discovered the purpose of those four gilded\r\ncamp-stools round the throne. I had hoped to see one of the Tsar’s four\r\nlittle daughters seated on each, but they served only as resting-places\r\nfor the majestic toys of kings.\r\n\r\nClose behind his toys, the little Tsar himself was seen advancing.\r\nThere was a timid swagger in his gait, but he walked alone, and\r\nhis uniform looked simple after the finery we had seen. The aged\r\nmetropolitan of St. Petersburg stood in wait for him with the holy kiss\r\nand a bunch of green herbs dipped in consecrated water. Behind the\r\nTsar came his mother and his wife, who were refused the sprinkling,\r\nbut gained the other blessing. Twelve feet behind them their trains\r\nextended flat along the floor, and, as in a fairy tale, armed men stood\r\nready to help with the weight of each. At a safe distance behind the\r\ntrains were halted the Grand Dukes in two or three rows of repeated\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\nWith voices of thunder and voices from the tomb, the priests chanted,\r\nand called, and read the golden book as only Russian priests are able,\r\nand the rows of crimson choir sang the wailing responses between. Upon\r\nthe right the flashing crowd was busy bowing and signing the cross.\r\nRarely is such religious zeal to be witnessed as the Grand Dukes\r\ndisplayed in crossing themselves; for in this evidence of sanctity they\r\nsurpassed the very bishops. But the stiff-necked generation on the\r\nleft remained unmoved. One or two peasants crossed themselves as they\r\nwere accustomed; a few more complied when the priest shook the solid\r\ncross threateningly in their direction; but the black phalanx stood\r\nunmoved--polite but detached spectators of these curious survivals.\r\n\r\nThe service ceased, the bishops stood aside, the altar was carried\r\naway, the Empresses swept to their corner among the white-shouldered\r\nladies on the right of the throne. In the open space the little Tsar\r\nstood solitary. Gathering together all the initiative in his nature,\r\nhe walked slowly up the floor, mounted the steps, faced round to the\r\nassembly, and sat down upon the negligent ermine robe. A brilliant\r\nofficial handed him a large parchment, and he stood up to read. Amid\r\nthe intent silence of contrary hopes and expectations, his voice\r\nsounded clear. All knew that a turning-point in history had come, and\r\nthat to this little man one of the world’s great opportunities had been\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nBut with every sentence that was pronounced, the hopes of the new\r\nage faded. As commonplace succeeded commonplace, amid the usual\r\nappeals to Heaven and the expression of such affection as monarchs\r\nalways feel for their subjects, it was seen that no concession was\r\nmade, no conciliation attempted. The one paragraph in which something\r\ncomparatively definite was said about the Imperial heart’s solicitude\r\nfor the peasants and the future enlightenment of the people--that\r\nparagraph was marked by the dangerous old phrase of “unwavering\r\nfirmness,” and by fresh insistence upon the necessity of order.[7] When\r\nthe end came, and the colours were waved, and the band played, and\r\nthe officials shouted, “Hurrah!” while the Imperial procession marched\r\nfrom the hall, the members of the party of progress stood dumb. They\r\nknew now that for the future they had only themselves to look to, and\r\nthat the greatest conflict of all still lay before them. Had the Tsar\r\nbut granted an amnesty to the thousands on thousands of prisoners still\r\nlying in gaol because their political views did not coincide with his\r\nown, it would have been difficult to measure the extent of his future\r\ninfluence. But one of the world’s opportunities had again been offered\r\nhim, and not for the first time he had refused it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, come what will, the 10th of May was really a\r\nturning-point in history. On the evening after the battle of Valmy,\r\nwhere the new order of citizen-soldier held its own against the\r\nmercenaries of kings, Goethe said to his comrades on the field, “To-day\r\na new age begins, and we can say we were present at its birth.”\r\nThose were the words that rang in my mind as I watched the uniforms\r\nand decorations disappear in their carriages, and then followed the\r\nnew deputies, and saw the prisoners waving their handkerchiefs in\r\ngreeting from the barred windows of the Cross prison over the river,\r\nand stood among the crowd at the new Duma’s door, and listened to the\r\ndeep-mouthed cheers, while the whole air sounded with the cries of\r\n“Amnesty!” and “Freedom!”\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg is particularly rich in the dignified classic\r\narchitecture of the eighteenth century, but of all the examples\r\nof this style none is so beautiful as the interior of the Taurida\r\nPalace, which Catherine II. built as a present for her lover Potemkin.\r\nWith little change it has now been converted into the simplest and\r\nnoblest of all Houses of Parliament, and it was there that the first\r\nmeeting of Russia’s chosen representatives was opened at four o’clock\r\nthat afternoon. The first business was the election of a Speaker or\r\nPresident. Every one knew that Muromtzeff, a Constitutional Democrat,\r\nand one of the members for Moscow, would be elected. In his youth he\r\nhad been Professor of Law in Moscow University, but had been driven\r\nfrom his Chair by a Government which trembles at excellence in any\r\nform. Since then he had won a high reputation at the bar, and was\r\nknown as the greatest authority on Parliamentary procedure. His\r\ncharacter, his dignified bearing, and his long service to liberty all\r\ncontributed to make his election certain, but when it was found that he\r\nhad been chosen by 426 votes to 3, this evidence of the Duma’s spirit\r\nrather startled the politicians who believe in the blessings of a solid\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\nHis few and dignified words in thanking the members for raising him to\r\nthis high position in a State that at last had become constitutional,\r\nformed a fit opening for the new Parliament’s work. But it had been\r\narranged beforehand that the first real speech should be delivered\r\nby Petrunkevitch--Ivan Petrunkevitch, one of the members for Tver,\r\nan aged and distinguished Zemstvoist, and leader among such Radical\r\nreformers as are not Socialists--one of those who at the beginning of\r\nthe Tsar’s reign urged him in vain to constitutional ways. Inevitably\r\nhe chose as his subject the demand for amnesty. His speech was utterly\r\nirregular. There was no motion or question before the House. He broke\r\nevery rule of Parliamentary procedure. But that did not matter in the\r\nleast. One thought filled all hearts--the thought of those thousands of\r\nprisoners--seventy-five thousand of them, it was said--still lying in\r\ngaol for their love of freedom, and it was of amnesty and amnesty alone\r\nthat all except a few ungenerous spirits wished first to hear.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was then adjourned over the next day, in order that\r\nMuromtzeff might report his appointment to the Tsar, who from the\r\nWinter Palace had rapidly sought the country retirement where he could\r\nfeel himself comparatively courageous.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of that Friday, the 11th of May, the State Council,\r\nto which had been entrusted equal powers with the Duma, condescended\r\nto meet. No crowd watched its members arriving, no prisoners waved\r\nthem good wishes. An Upper Chamber is raised above the interest of the\r\nmasses and the gaol-birds of freedom. Its members were quite aware\r\nthat it was their part in the new constitution only to fulfil the two\r\nfunctions required of such bodies as the British House of Lords--to\r\noppose a permanent barrier to progress, and to provide a cheap reward\r\nfor obsolete insignificance. As there was yet no progress to bar, and\r\nfew but themselves were obsolete, they had no call to hurry.\r\n\r\nSo in the heat of the summer afternoon, having taken a day to recover\r\nfrom the strain of the previous ceremony, they began to gather\r\nleisurely in their new hall. In theory they were the same old “Council\r\nof Empire” which for many years had served as a field for the display\r\nof decorations. And certainly the decorations had not lost their\r\nlustre. It was the same uniformed throng as had gathered in the Winter\r\nPalace, and they had assumed the same glitter. Conspicuous even among\r\ntheir glories was one ancient courtier, who had maintained the Empire\r\nunder Nicholas I. before the Crimean War, and still went smiling round\r\nhis orbit, brave with the sixty-five medals of his years of service,\r\nwhile Orders stood clustered on his breast thick as stars upon the\r\nMilky Way; for, unhappily, he had not followed the example of others,\r\nand made room for his honours by increasing his girth.\r\n\r\nBut even the oldest members of the Council must have been dimly aware\r\nof changing times, for instead of the familiar old Marie Palace on the\r\nsquare opposite St. Isaac’s cathedral, where so many happy afternoons\r\nof important idleness had been spent, they now found themselves in the\r\n“Noblemen’s Assembly” or Club, quite a dignified and classic place,\r\nbut not the house they were accustomed to. And actually mixed up among\r\nthem stood a lot of elected and unknown gentlemen, representing the\r\nChurch, the Universities, Commerce and Industry, the big towns, and\r\nother dubious institutions that hang upon the borderland of vulgarity.\r\nWhat was worse, all the six representatives of the Universities openly\r\nprofessed the Constitutional Democratic faith, and five or six more\r\nwere known to lean towards that terrible party which dominated the\r\nLower House. The only consolation was that just half the Council were\r\nstill nominated by the Tsar himself, and that of the rest some eighty\r\nper cent. could be trusted to agree with any Tsar’s nominees. It was\r\na relief also to discover that the very few who possessed no uniforms\r\nhad shown the decency of putting on evening dress when they got up that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBy two o’clock a good many members had assembled. Goremykin, the new\r\nPremier, was there, languid and neutral in the ministerial stalls.\r\nAlexeieff of Manchuria came, and Ignatieff, the Tsar’s fat friend,\r\nand no one thought it strange when the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg\r\nbestowed three kisses of holy peace upon Golitzin, the slaughterer of\r\nthe Caucasus. Trepoff, who rules the Imperial circle, and parched old\r\nPobiedonostzeff, so long Russia’s guide to God, were reported present.\r\nDurnovo, late ill-omened Minister of Interior, was there, and at his\r\nside Witte, his uncertain enemy, had come to hear his own belated\r\nappointment as member of the Council read out, and to meditate the\r\ntearful appeal for amnesty by which three days later he was to reveal\r\nto his brothers the workmen a heart melting in pity over the woes he\r\nhad himself inflicted.\r\n\r\nSo they gathered and chatted and sat down, and then, having nothing\r\nelse to do, they prayed. For forty minutes the golden priests prayed\r\nand sang at golden tables placed before the portrait of the Tsar. Then\r\nCount Solsky, whom the Tsar had chosen as President, took his seat,\r\na few messages were read, it was agreed to return a gracious answer\r\nto the speech from the throne, and Count Solsky, who is much like the\r\nlate Lord Salisbury in appearance, did what Lord Salisbury himself\r\nwould have done under the circumstances: he yawned, muttered something\r\ninaudible, and adjourned the assembly by turning his back upon it.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Council throughout would well have become any Second\r\nChamber in the world, but in the Duma things did not go so leisurely,\r\nnor were the members so content with the result. On Saturday, May 12th,\r\nat eleven, the first true meeting of a popular assembly in Russia\r\nbegan. For nearly twelve hours on end that sitting continued, and yet\r\nthe immense labour of Russian reform seemed to have advanced no step.\r\nMembers chafed with impatience. Why not make a beginning since all were\r\nagreed, and so much had now to be accomplished? The same impatience\r\nwas seen lately even in England, where we have spent six centuries in\r\nattempting to perfect the method of self-government. But in Russia\r\nthe lesson began that day, the evils to be amended were incomparably\r\nvaster, and the need of haste was such as England cannot conceive.\r\nFor over the Duma the sword hung by a hair. The very approach to the\r\nTaurida Palace passed through long lines of barracks, and in the left\r\nwing of the building itself companies of the Guards had just been\r\nstationed, ready for any event.\r\n\r\nAnd as to waste of time, let us remember the difficulties that beset\r\nthe infant Parliament. The chamber itself was a large amphitheatre of\r\nseats gently rising on steps, each seat fitted with a desk. In a long\r\ngallery at the back of the amphitheatre, ambassadors, strangers, and\r\nladies were allowed to be present, and the Russian ladies are so far\r\nadvanced in civilization that no metal bars were thought necessary\r\nto restrain their savage tendencies. Opposite, in the middle of the\r\nsemicircle’s diameter, rose the President’s high box, and just below it\r\nwas the Tribune, from which all members were obliged to speak, except\r\nfor very short questions or explanations. The President grasped a large\r\nbell, but managed to control the assembly without a wig or robes.\r\nBehind his chair was a large open space, furnished with tables, where\r\nthe ballotting and counting took place. On each side of the chamber was\r\na large, empty lobby, and behind it a vast hall with polished floor ran\r\nfrom end to end of the building, for the meetings of groups and the\r\ndiscovery of wisdom by members as they walked. Beyond the hall were\r\ndining-rooms, tea-rooms, telegraph rooms, telephones, committee-rooms,\r\nreceptacles for goloshes, and all else that the nature of a member of\r\nparliament requires.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Chamber, on the right and left of the President’s\r\nbox, and facing the assembly, were a number of raised seats for any\r\nMinisters who might choose to attend. The Ministers had no connection\r\nwith the assembly; they might not vote; they were responsible only\r\nto the Tsar, who appointed them. Among the members there were no\r\nMinisters, there was no “Government,” there was no one to arrange the\r\norder of business or the introduction of measures. Any member got up\r\nand proposed what he pleased. In the subsequent discussion on the\r\nAddress, for instance, from eleven in the morning till seven at night,\r\nmembers rose in succession and made stupendous proposals of reform that\r\nwere neither discussed nor rejected. At first the parties did not even\r\ndivide themselves into Right and Left, but members took their seats\r\nanyhow, and when in a few days the inevitable division began to show\r\nitself, the Right was so scanty as to be hardly visible. Though the\r\ntrue Right numbered about seventy, they were ashamed to be seen on the\r\nright, and all members edged as far left as possible. Votes were taken\r\nsometimes by members standing up, sometimes by division into lobbies,\r\nbut the ultimate appeal was to secret ballot, so that it was impossible\r\nto calculate a party’s votes or to control the relation of a member\r\nto his constituents’ desire. During the speeches, applause was rare,\r\nbut at the end members vigorously clapped their hands if they were\r\npleased. They spoke of each other by bare surnames, and would probably\r\nuse Christian names in Russian fashion as they became more intimate.\r\nThey addressed the assembly as “Gentlemen,” and even as “Comrades.”\r\nThe President freely interrupted speakers, argued with them, and\r\ngave them little lectures on the procedure and Constitutional Law of\r\nother countries. On the first day several members wanted to speak two\r\nor three times upon the same question, and explanations of previous\r\nspeeches were as long as the originals.\r\n\r\nThere were many difficulties and many differences from our own ancient\r\nhabits, around which the interesting rags and tatters of the past\r\nstill flutter. But in starting fresh, the Russian Parliament had at\r\nleast as much advantage as difficulty, and it will rapidly develop\r\nimprovements for which we ourselves shall long have to fight against\r\nthe ghostly influence of our forefathers. One of the first acts of the\r\nDuma was to appoint a committee of nineteen to draw up a new scheme of\r\nprocedure, and they had many lessons to suggest to older Parliaments.\r\nBut all these discussions on methods and the inevitable mistakes of\r\nbeginners meant waste of time, and waste of time was more irritating to\r\nthe Duma members than to our own, because, being peasants and workmen,\r\nthe majority of them were more serious, their hopes were younger, and,\r\nhaving no Ministers, they had no one to abuse.\r\n\r\nAs to the course of business itself, almost the whole of the first\r\nfull day was occupied in nominating candidates as Vice-Presidents\r\nand four secretaries. The names of the members proposed had to be\r\ncollected in boxes and arranged in lists. Then followed a slow march\r\nround and round the President’s box for the ballot. That slow march\r\nlasted for hours. Next day (Sunday) it was renewed for the election\r\nof thirty-three members to draw up an Address in answer to the Tsar’s\r\nspeech. When that was over the committee of nineteen had to be elected\r\nfor procedure. Monday there was no meeting because the Address was\r\nbeing prepared. Tuesday they began to talk about the Address. Wednesday\r\nthey continued talking about the Address, and the wrongs of Russia were\r\nat least mentioned. On Thursday the Address was discussed clause by\r\nclause, and a week of the Duma had gone.[8]\r\n\r\nTo most of the Constitutional Democrats who held the majority inside\r\nthe Duma, to highly educated men like Professor Muromtzeff, the\r\nPresident, or Professor Miliukoff, who directed the party from the\r\noutside, because the Government did not allow his election--to men\r\nlike these it was probably evident that all this talk on procedure and\r\ndiscussion of principles were essential to popular government, and that\r\ndelay was part of every great beginning. But the Duma was democratic\r\nbeyond anything that our House of Commons has yet imagined. Certainly\r\nit contained only about fifteen workmen from the towns, because the\r\nelection of others was annulled by the violence of authority. But it\r\ncontained about 170 of the peasant class, a few of whom had educated\r\nthemselves highly and quitted their villages; but some could not read,\r\nand nearly all were fine, heavy-browed countrymen, with big shoulders\r\nand great brown hands. They had left their dear strips of earth, their\r\ndear horses and ploughs, and had come to the smelling city for the\r\none and only purpose of winning the land back for the people who work\r\nit. What did it profit them to walk on polished floors with top-boots\r\nclean and long coats neatly brushed; to listen to discourses on\r\nconstitutional procedure; to talk in tea-rooms with men who do not know\r\nsand from clay; to tramp for hours dropping marbles into green boxes;\r\nand to receive invitations to banquets which they most honourably\r\nrefused?\r\n\r\nThey yearned for the old horse at home, and for the fragrant earth\r\nwhere the corn was sprouting now. They were on a holy mission; they\r\nwould not go back. “We dare not go back without the land,” they said;\r\n“our villagers would kill us.” In some cases, aged peasants of pious\r\ngravity had been sent up at the expense of the village as overseers\r\nto watch that the members did their duty, and to complain straight\r\nto the Tsar if the land was not restored to its cultivators at once.\r\nForty-three of the peasant members were supposed to belong to the Right\r\nand were roughly classed as the “Black Hundred,” though in these early\r\ndays of the Duma they voted steadily with the rest. But if the Labour\r\nParty, as the majority of the peasants and the workmen combined began\r\nthen to be called, felt a little puzzled and impatient at the number\r\nof things that had to be done before anything could be done, it was\r\nno wonder. We can also understand the difficulties of a Professor of\r\nConstitutional Law brought face to face with such a situation.\r\n\r\nBehind these passing apprehensions and disappointments lay the one\r\ngreat question which occupied the thoughts of all during the Duma’s\r\nfirst regular day of meeting. The sitting opened with messages of\r\ncongratulation from Russian towns, from the Finland Diet, and from\r\nmany foreign countries, even down to Bohemia and Montenegro. From\r\nEngland, from the Labour Party at all events, a message had been\r\nexpected, but none came. Last of all, four telegrams were read from\r\ngroups of “politicals” still in gaol, and amid shouts of “Amnesty!”\r\nthe whole Duma rose and remained standing till the reading was\r\nfinished. The world-without-end hours of balloting and discussion of\r\nprocedure next intervened, and it was not till late in the evening\r\nthat the burning question was reached at last. Roditcheff, another\r\nof the members for Tver, had won the right to introduce it by his\r\nlong service to the growth of constitutional liberty; for, like his\r\ncolleague Petrunkevitch, he had been among those whose petition for\r\nsome degree of popular representation in the government had been\r\nrejected by the Tsar twelve years before as an “idle dream.” A peasant\r\nleader, Anikin, member for Saratoff, followed him with an even stronger\r\nand more eloquent claim for justice towards those who still suffered\r\nin the cause of such freedom as Russia now appeared to have won.\r\nOther speeches were made, each becoming shorter and stronger as the\r\nexcitement rose. At last the speeches ended. The question that the\r\ndemand for amnesty be included in the address to the Tsar was put, and\r\nlike one man, with one great shout, the whole assembly of Russia’s\r\nfirst representatives rose in answer.\r\n\r\nWith that scene, this simple record of the things I have lately\r\nwitnessed may close. I have been told by men of high judgment and\r\nauthority that the title chosen for the book is too hopeful, that the\r\nhour of dawn is still far off in Russia. In moments of despair during\r\nlast winter I should have agreed; the forces of ancient oppression\r\nstill appeared irresistibly strong. But writing as I do within the Duma\r\nitself, face to face with the grave and determined representatives of\r\nthe Russian people, I cannot but hope that something has been gained\r\nwhich no violence in the world can compel them ever to surrender. I\r\nknow the power of tradition, and I know well the power of the sword.\r\nBut perhaps it may still be proved that more powerful even than\r\ntradition and the sword is the passion for freedom and justice which\r\nlives in the soul of many.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN OF\r\n    MOSCOW]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Akinoff, Minister of

WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, LONDON AND BECCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See especially his book on “The Russian Peasant.”\r\n\r\n[2] After the rising was suppressed, this officer was detained for a\r\nfortnight and then released.\r\n\r\n[3] The following is the text of this appeal:--“The anniversary of the\r\n9th (22nd) of January, 1905, lies immediately before us. Russia has not\r\nforgotten that day, and will never forget it. The memory of those who\r\nin the streets of the capital were attacked by the hosts of violence,\r\nand sacrificed their lives to their confidence in our rulers, their\r\nfaith in the possibility of influencing them by peaceful means--the\r\nmemory of these martyrs is engraved upon the hearts of the Russian\r\npeople in words of sorrow and rage.\r\n\r\n“Citizens of St. Petersburg! We appeal to you to honour a memory like\r\ntheirs! We appeal to you to celebrate the first anniversary of that\r\ndark day! Henceforward let the 9th of January be a day of universal\r\nmourning among us. To honour the memory of those who fell for the\r\npeople’s freedom, let all citizens abstain from their ordinary work.\r\nFor this day let the toil of our city’s life be laid aside, so that\r\na peaceful stillness may serve as the symbol of our general sorrow.\r\nOn this day let not our mourning be broken by customary pleasures. On\r\nthe day of the people’s sorrow what have we to do with song and art?\r\nCitizens, we call on you not only to avoid places of entertainment, but\r\nnot to visit the banks or other public institutions. Draw down your\r\nblinds, and in the evening hang curtains before your windows, so that\r\nno light may be cast upon the streets from the houses. Let the day\r\nconsecrated to the martyrs of January 9th be kept as a day of absolute\r\nsilence, a day of deep and universal mourning, a day for sad and angry\r\nremembrance of all the victims which have been torn from our midst by\r\nthe enemies of the people’s freedom.”\r\n\r\n[4] Figures from the _Times_ of February 24, 1906.\r\n\r\n[5] See Carlyle’s “Frederick the Great,” Book II. ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[6] Figures from the _Times_ of January 15, 1906.\r\n\r\n[7] The text of the speech was as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Divine Providence has laid on me the care of the welfare of the\r\nFatherland, and has moved me to summon representatives elected by the\r\npeople, to co-operate in the work of framing laws.\r\n\r\n“With an ardent belief in a prosperous future for Russia, I welcome in\r\nyou the best men, to whose election I commanded my beloved subjects to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n“Difficult and complicated labours await you, but I believe that the\r\nardent wishes of the dear native land will inspire you and will unite\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n“I with unwavering firmness will uphold the institutions which I have\r\nestablished, in the firm conviction that you will devote all your\r\npowers to the self-sacrificing service of the Fatherland, to a clear\r\npresentation of the needs of the peasants, which lie so close to my\r\nheart, to the enlightenment of the people, and to the development of\r\nits well-being. You must realize that for the great welfare of the\r\nState, not only is Liberty necessary, but also order on the basis of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n“May my ardent wishes be fulfilled! may I see my people happy, and be\r\nable to bequeath to my son as his inheritance a firmly-established,\r\nwell-ordered, and enlightened State!\r\n\r\n“May God bless me, in conjunction with the Council of Empire and the\r\nDuma, in the work before us, and may this day prove the rejuvenation of\r\nRussia’s moral outlook and the reincarnation of her best powers.\r\n\r\n“Go to the work to which I have summoned you, and justify worthily the\r\ntrust of your Tsar and your country! God help me and you!”\r\n\r\n[8] The following were the chief points suggested by the Committee\r\nfor the answer to the Tsar’s speech. They defined the programme of\r\nthe majority:--The responsibility of Ministers to the majority in the\r\nDuma; universal suffrage (women’s suffrage was afterwards added);\r\nthe abolition of the State Council; the necessity of land reform and\r\nuniversal education; the equality of rights for all classes before\r\nthe law; freedom of conscience, person, domicile, speech, press, and\r\nmeeting; control of the budget and redistribution of taxation; local\r\nself-government for separate nationalities; amnesty and the abolition\r\nof capital punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n1.
