The working man only a few weeks or months from England has\r\nexpressed his opposition to those stratagems with war for their aim\r\nwhich would leave him without the defence he has at present from the\r\npressure of employers. Journalists only a few years, months, or weeks\r\nfrom Europe, have written, not perhaps expressing a desire for war,\r\nbut implying it might be well if the wave swept across South Africa,\r\nand especially across that portion which is richest in mineral wealth,\r\nand, therefore, more to be desired. South Africans and men from Europe\r\nalike have written deprecating war, because of the vast suffering\r\nand loss it would occasion to individuals. Dutch and English South\r\nAfricans have written (as one in an able and powerful letter dated from\r\nVrededorp, which appeared a few days ago) proving the injustice that\r\nwould be inflicted on the people of Africa, the violation of treaties\r\nand trust. But, amid all this chorus of opinion there is one voice\r\nwhich, though heard, has not yet been heard with that distinctness\r\nand fulness which its authority demands--it is the voice of the\r\nAfrican-born Englishman who loves England, the man who, born in South\r\nAfrica, and loving it as all men, who are men, love their birth-land,\r\nis yet an Englishman, bound to England not only by ties of blood, but\r\nthat much more intense passion which springs from personal contact\r\nalone. Our position is unique, and it would seem that we are marked\r\nout, at the present juncture of South African affairs, for an especial\r\nfunction, which imposes on us, at whatever cost to ourselves, the duty\r\nof making our voices heard and taking our share in the life of our two\r\nnations, at their\r\n\r\n  MOST CRITICAL JUNCTURE.\r\n\r\nFor, let us consider what exactly our position is.\r\n\r\nBorn in South Africa, our eyes first opened on these African hills and\r\nplains; around us, of other parentage but born with us in the land, our\r\nbirth-fellows, were men of another white race; and we grew up side by\r\nside with them. Is it strange that, like all men living, who have the\r\nhearts of men, we learnt to love this land in which we first saw light?\r\nIn after years, when we left it, and lived months or years across the\r\nseas, is it strange we carried it with us in our hearts? When we stood\r\non the Alps and looked down on the lakes and forests of Switzerland,\r\nthat we have said, “This is fair, but South Africa to us is fairer?”\r\nThat when on the top of Milan Cathedral and we have looked out across\r\nthe wide plains of Lombardy, we have said, “This is noble; but\r\nnobler to us are the broad plains of Africa, with their brown kopjes\r\nshimmering in the translucent sunshine?” Is it strange that when, after\r\nlong years of absence, years it may be of success and the joy which\r\nsprings from human fellowship and youth, our ship has cast its anchor\r\nin sight of Table Bay, and the great front of Table Mountain has\r\nreared up before us, a cry of passionate joy has welled up within us;\r\nand when we saw the black men with their shining skins unloading in the\r\ndocks, and the rugged faces of South Africans, browned with our African\r\nsun, we put our foot on the dear old earth again, and our hearts have\r\ncried: “We are South Africans! We have come back again to our land and\r\nto our people?” Is it strange that when we are in other lands and we\r\nfear that death approaches us, we say: “Take me back! We may live away\r\nfrom her, but when we are dead we must lie on her breast. Bury us among\r\nthe kopjes where we played when we were children, and let the iron\r\nstones and red sand cover us?” Is it strange that wherever we live we\r\nall want to go home to die; and that the time comes when we know that\r\ndearer far to us than fame or success is one little handful of our own\r\nred South African earth? Is it strange that, when the\r\n\r\n  TIME OF STRESS AND DANGER\r\n\r\ncomes to our land, we realize what, perhaps, we were but dimly\r\nconscious of before, that we are Africans, that for this land and\r\npeople we could live--if need be, we could die?\r\n\r\nIs it strange we should feel this? The Scotchman feels it for his\r\nheathery hills, the Swiss for his valleys. All men who are men feel it\r\nfor the land of their birth!\r\n\r\nWhat is strange is not that we have this feeling, but that, side by\r\nside with it, we have another. We love Africa, but we love England\r\nalso. It is not merely that when for the first time we visit the old\r\nnesting place of our people it is rich for us with associations, that\r\nwe tread it for the first time with something of the awe and reverence\r\nwith which men tread an old cathedral, rich with remains of the great\r\ndead and past; it is not merely that the associations of language and\r\nliterature bind us to it, nor that in some city or country churchyard\r\nwe stand beside the graves of our forefathers, and trace on mould-eaten\r\nstones the names we have been familiar with in Africa, and bear as our\r\nown; nor is it that we can linger yet on the steps of the church where\r\nour parents were united before they moved to the far South, and made\r\nof us South Africans. Beyond all these impersonal, and more or less\r\nintellectual ties, we form a personal one with England. Whether we\r\nhave gone home as students to college or university, or for purposes of\r\nart, literature, or professional labor, as time passes there springs up\r\naround us\r\n\r\n  A NETWORK OF TENDER BONDS;\r\n\r\nthere are formed the closest friendships our hearts will ever know,\r\nsuch as are formed only in the spring time of life; there is gained\r\nour first deep knowledge of life, and there grow up within us passions\r\nand modes of thought we will carry with us to our graves. After years,\r\nit may be after many years, when we return, on the walls of our study\r\nin South Africa we still keep fastened in memory of the past the old\r\noar with which we won our first boating victory on Cam or Thames; and\r\nthe faces of the men who shared our victory with us still look down\r\nat us from our walls. Not dearer to any Englishman is the memory of\r\nhis Alma Mater than to him who sits thousands of miles off in the\r\nSouth, and who, as he smokes his last pipe of African Boer or Transvaal\r\ntobacco, is visited often by memories of days that will never fade,\r\nevenings on the river with bright faces and soft voices, long midnight\r\nconclaves over glimmering fires, when, with voices and hearts as young\r\nand glowing as our own, we discussed all problems of the universe\r\nand longed to go out into life that we might settle them--they come\r\nback to us with all the glitter and light which hangs only about the\r\nremembrances of youth: and for many of us the memory of fog-smitten\r\nLondon is inextricably blended with the all profoundest emotions, the\r\nmost passionate endeavors, noblest relations our hearts will ever know.\r\nThe steamers that come weekly to South Africa are not for us merely\r\nvessels bringing news from foreign lands; nor do they merely bring for\r\nus the intellectual pabulum which feeds our mental life; they bring us\r\n\r\n  “NEWS FROM HOME.”\r\n\r\nIn London houses, in country cottages, in English manufacturing towns,\r\nare men and women whose life and labor, whose joy and sorrows our\r\nhearts will follow to the end, as theirs will follow ours to the end,\r\nand across the seas our hands will always be interknit with theirs. Our\r\nlabor, our homes, our material interests, may all be in South Africa,\r\nbut a bond of love so strong that six thousand miles of sea can only\r\nstretch it, but never sever it, binds us to the land and the friends we\r\nloved in our youth. We are South Africans, but intellectual sympathies,\r\nhabits, personal emotions, have made us strike deep roots across the\r\nsea; and when the thought flashes on us, we may not walk the old\r\nstreets again or press the old hands, pain rises which those only know\r\nwhose hearts are divided between two lands. We are South Africans, but\r\nwe are not South Africans only--we are Englishmen also:\r\n\r\n  Dear little Island,\r\n  Our heart in the sea!\r\n\r\nIf to-morrow hostile fleets encompassed England, and the tread of\r\nforeign troops was on her soil, she would not need to call to us; we\r\nwould stand beside her before she had spoken. This is\r\n\r\n  OUR EXACT POSITION.\r\n\r\nSide by side with us in South Africa are other South Africans whose\r\nposition is not and cannot be exactly what ours is. Shading away from\r\nus by imperceptible degrees, stand, on one side of us, those English\r\nSouth Africans who, racially English, yet know nothing or little\r\npersonally of her; the grandparents, and not the parents of such\r\nmen, have left England; they are proud of being Englishmen, proud\r\nof England’s great record and great names, as a man is proud of his\r\ngrandmother’s family, but they are before all things essentially South\r\nAfrican. They desire to see England increase and progress, and to\r\nremain in harmony and union with her while she does not interfere with\r\ninternal affairs of South Africa, but they do not and cannot feel to\r\nher as those of us do whose love is personal and whose intellectual\r\nsympathies center largely in England.\r\n\r\nYet further from us on the same side stand our oldest white fellow\r\nSouth Africans; who were, many, not of English blood originally,\r\nthough among that body of early white settlers, men who preceded us\r\nin South Africa by three centuries, were a few with English names,\r\nand though by intermarriage Dutch and English South Africans are\r\ndaily and hourly blending, the bulk of these folk were Dutchmen from\r\nHolland and Friesland, with a few Swedes, Germans and Danes, and later\r\nwas intermingled with them a strong strain of Huguenot blood from\r\nFrance. These men were mainly of that folk which, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, held Philip and the Spanish Empire at bay, and struck the\r\nfirst death-blow into the heart of that mighty Imperial system whose\r\ndeath-gasp we have witnessed to-day. A brave, free, fearless folk with\r\nthe\r\n\r\n  BLOOD OF THE OLD SEA KINGS\r\n\r\nin their veins; a branch of that old Teutonic race which came with the\r\nAngles and Saxons into England and subdued the Britons, and who, in\r\nthe persons of the Franks, entered Gaul, and spread its blood across\r\nEurope. They are a people most nearly akin to the English of all\r\nEuropean folk, in language, form and feature resembling them, and in a\r\ncertain dogged persistence, and an inalienable indestructible air of\r\npersonal freedom.\r\n\r\nEven under the early Dutch Government of the East India Company, they\r\nwere not always restful and resented interference and external control.\r\nThey frequently felt themselves “ondergedrukt,”[A] and, taking their\r\nguns, and getting together wife and children and all that they had, and\r\ninspanning their wagons, they trekked[B] away from the scant boards\r\nof civilization into the wilderness, to form homes of freedom for\r\nthemselves and their descendants.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 England obtained the Cape as the result of European\r\ncomplications, and the South African people, without request or desire\r\non their part, were given over to England. England retired from the\r\nCape in 1803, but, owing to other changes in Europe, she took the Cape\r\nagain in 1806, and has since then been the\r\n\r\n  GUARDIAN OF OUR SEAS,\r\n\r\nand the strongest power in our land. Since that time, for the last\r\nninety years, Englishmen have slowly been added to the population,\r\nbut the men of Dutch descent still form the majority of white South\r\nAfricans throughout the Cape Colony, Free State, and Transvaal,\r\noutnumbering at the present day, even with the accession of the\r\nforeigners (Uitlanders mean foreigners in Dutch) to the goldfields of\r\nthe Transvaal, those of English descent, as probably about two to one.\r\n\r\nSo we of England became step-mother to this South African people. We\r\nEnglish are a virile race. There is perhaps no one with a drop of\r\nEnglish blood in his veins who does not feel pride in that knowledge.\r\nWe are a brave and, for ourselves, a freedom-loving race; the best\r\nof us have nobler qualities yet--we love justice; we admire courage\r\nand the love of freedom in others as well as ourselves; and we find it\r\ndifficult to put our foot on the weak, it refuses to go down. At times,\r\nwhether as individuals or as a nation, we are capable of the\r\n\r\n  MOST HEROIC MORAL ACTION.\r\n\r\nThe heart swells with pride when we remember what has been done by\r\nEnglishmen, at different times and in different places, in the cause\r\nof freedom and justice, when they could meet with no reward and had\r\nnothing to gain. Such an act of justice on the part of the English\r\nnation was done in 1881 when Gladstone gave back to the Transvaal the\r\nindependence which had been mistakenly taken. I would not say policy\r\nhad no part in the action of the wise old man. No doubt that keen\r\neagle-eye had fixed itself closely on the truth which all history\r\nteaches that a colony of Teutonic folk cannot be kept permanently in\r\nharmony and union with the Mother Country by any bond but that of\r\nlove, mutual sympathy and honor. The child may be reduced by force to\r\nobedience; but time passes and the child becomes a youth; the youth may\r\nbe coerced; but the day comes when the youth becomes a man, and there\r\ncan be no coercion then. If the mother wishes to retain the affection\r\nof the man, she must win it from the youth. This the wise old man saw;\r\nbut I believe that, over and above the wisdom, he saw the right, and\r\nthe action was no less heroic because it was wise; for other men see\r\ntruth who have not the courage to follow her, and accept present loss\r\nfor a gain which lies across the centuries.\r\n\r\nWe English are a fearless folk, and in the main I think we seek after\r\njustice, but we have our faults. We are not a sympathetic or a quickly\r\ncomprehending people; we are slow and we are proud; we are shut in by a\r\ncertain\r\n\r\n  SHELL OF HARD RESERVE.\r\n\r\nThere are probably few of us who have not some consciousness of this\r\ndefect in our own persons; it may be a fault allied to our highest\r\nvirtues, but it is a fault, and a serious one as regards our relations\r\nwith peoples who come under our rule. We may and do generally sincerely\r\ndesire justice; we may have no wish to oppress, but we do not readily\r\nunderstand wants and conditions distinct from our own. Here and there\r\ngreat Englishmen have appeared in South African history as elsewhere\r\n(such as Sir William Porter and Sir George Grey) who have been able to\r\nthrow themselves sympathetically into the entire life of the people\r\nabout, to love them, and so to comprehend their wants and win their\r\naffections. Such men are the burning and shining lights of our Imperial\r\nand Colonial system, but they are not common. Undoubtedly the officials\r\nsent out to rule the Cape in the old days were generally men who\r\nearnestly desired to do their duty; but they did not always understand\r\nthe folk they had to rule. They were generally simple soldiers, brave,\r\nfearless and honorable as the English soldier is apt to be, but with\r\nhard military conceptions of government and discipline. Our Dutch\r\nfellow South Africans are a strange folk. Virile, resolute, passionate\r\nwith a passion hid far below the surface, they are at once the gentlest\r\nand the most determined of peoples. When you try to coerce them they\r\nare hard as steel encased in iron, but with a large and generous\r\nresponse to affection and sympathy which perhaps no other European\r\nfolk gives. They may easily be deceived once; but never twice. Under\r\nthe roughest exterior of the up-country Boer lies a nature strangely\r\nsensitive and conscious of personal dignity; a people who never forgets\r\na kindness and does\r\n\r\n  NOT EASILY FORGET A WRONG.\r\n\r\nOur officials did not always understand them; they made no allowances\r\nfor a race of brave, free men inhabiting a country which by the might\r\nof their own right hand they had won from savages and wild beasts, and\r\nwho were given over into the hands of a strange government without\r\ntheir consent or desire; and the peculiarities which arose from their\r\nwild free life were not always sympathetically understood; even their\r\nlittle language, the South African “Taal,” a South African growth so\r\ndear to their hearts, and to all those of us who love indigenous and\r\nSouth African growths, was not sympathetically and gently dealt with.\r\nThe men, well meaning, but military, tried with this fierce, gentle,\r\nsensitive, free folk force, where they should have exercised a broad\r\nand comprehensive humanity; and when they did right (as when the\r\nslaves were freed), they did it often in such manner, that it became\r\npractically wrong. A little of that tact of the higher and larger kind,\r\nwhich springs from a human comprehension of another’s difficulties\r\nand needs, might, exercised in the old days, have saved South\r\nAfrica from all white-race problems; it was not, perhaps under the\r\nconditions, could not, be exercised. The people’s hearts ached under\r\nthe uncompromising iron rule. In 1815 there was a rising, and it was\r\nput down. As the traveler passes by train along the railway from Port\r\nElizabeth to Kimberley, he will come, a few miles beyond Cookhouse,\r\nto a gap between two hills; to his right flows the Fish River; to his\r\nleft, binding the two hills, is a ridge of land called in South Africa\r\na “nek.” It is a spot the thoughtful Englishman passes with deep pain.\r\nIn the year 1815 here were hanged five South Africans who had taken\r\npart in the rising, and the women who had fought beside them (for the\r\nSouth African woman has ever stood beside the man in all his labors and\r\nstruggles) were compelled to stand by and look on. The crowd of fellow\r\nSouth Africans who stood by them believed,\r\n\r\n  HOPED AGAINST HOPE,\r\n\r\nto the last moment, that a reprieve would come. Lord Charles Somerset\r\nsent none, and the tragedy was completed. The place is called to-day\r\n“Schlachter’s Nek,” or “Butcher’s Ridge.” Every South African child\r\nknows the story. Technically, any government has the right to hang\r\nthose who rise against its rule. Superficially it is a short way of\r\nending a difficulty for all governments. Historically it has often\r\nbeen found to be the method for perpetrating them. We may submerge for\r\na moment that which rises again more formidably for its blood bath.\r\nThe mistake made by Lord Charles Somerset in 1815 was as the mistake\r\nwould have been by President Kruger if, in 1896, instead of exercising\r\nthe large prerogative of mercy and magnanimity, he had destroyed the\r\nhandful of conspirators who attempted to destroy the State. Both would\r\nhave been within their legal right, but the Transvaal would have failed\r\nto find that path which runs higher than the path of mere law and leads\r\ntowards light. Fortunately for South Africa our little Republic found\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe reign of stern military rule at the Cape had this effect, that\r\nmen and women, with a sore in their proud hearts, continued to move\r\naway from a controlling power that did not understand them. Some moved\r\nacross the Orange River and joined the old “Voortrekkers” that had\r\nalready gone into that country which is now the Free State. England\r\nkept a certain virtual sovereignty over that territory, till, in 1854,\r\nshe grew weary of the expense it cost her, and withdrew from it in\r\nspite of the representations of certain of its inhabitants who sent a\r\ndeputation to England to request her to retain it. Thereupon the folk\r\norganized an independent State and Government; and the little land,\r\npeopled mainly by men of Dutch descent, but largely intermingled with\r\nEnglish who lived with them on terms of the greatest affection and\r\nunity, has become one of the most\r\n\r\n  PROSPEROUS, WELL-GOVERNED AND PEACEFUL\r\n\r\ncommunities on earth. Others, much the larger part of the people, moved\r\nfurther; they crossed the Vaal River, and in that wild northern land,\r\nwhere no Englishman’s foot had passed, they founded after some years\r\nthe gallant little Republic we all know to-day as the Transvaal. How\r\nthat Republic was founded is a story we all know. Alone, unbacked by\r\nany great Imperial or national power, with their old flint-lock guns in\r\ntheir hands as their only weapons, with wife and children, they passed\r\ninto that yet untrodden land. The terrible story of their struggles,\r\nthe death of Piet Retief and his brave followers, killed by treachery\r\nby the Zulu Chief, Dingaan, the victory of the survivors over him,\r\nwhich is still commemorated by their children as Dingaan’s Day, the\r\nwhole, perhaps, the most thrilling record of the struggle and suffering\r\nof a people in founding their State that the world can anywhere\r\nproduce. Paul Kruger can still remember how, after that terrible fight,\r\nwomen and children left alone in the fortified laager, he himself\r\nbeing but a child, they carried on bushes to fortify the laager, women\r\nwith children in their arms, or pregnant, laboring with strength of\r\nmen to entrench themselves against evil worse than death. Here in the\r\nwilderness they planted their homes, and founded their little State.\r\nMen and women are still living who can remember how, sixty years ago,\r\nthe spot where the great mining camp of Johannesburg now stands was a\r\ngreat silence where they drew up their wagon and planted their little\r\nhome, and\r\n\r\n  FOUGHT INCH BY INCH\r\n\r\nwith wild beasts to reclaim the desert. In this great northern land,\r\nwhich no white man had entered or desired, they planted their people,\r\nand loving it as men only can love the land they have suffered and\r\nbled for, the gallant little Republic they raised they love to-day as\r\nthe Swiss loves his mountain home and the Hollander his dykes. It is\r\ntheirs, the best land on earth to them.\r\n\r\nThey had fought not for money but for homes for their wives and\r\nchildren; when they battled, the wives reloaded the old flint-lock\r\nguns and handed them down from the front chest of their wagon for the\r\nmen who stood around defending them. It was a wild free fight, on\r\neven terms; there were no Maxim guns to mow down ebony figures by the\r\nhundred at the turn of a handle; a free even stand up fight; and there\r\nwere times when it almost seemed the assagai would overcome the old\r\nflint-lock, and the voortrekkers would be swept away. The panther and\r\nthe jaguar rolled together on the ground, and, if one conquered instead\r\nof the other, it was yet a fair fight, and South Africa has no reason\r\nto be ashamed of the way either her black men or her white men fought\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, has the Dutch South African always dealt gently and\r\ngenerously with the native folks with whom he came into contact, we\r\nanswer, “No, he has not”--neither has any other white race of whom we\r\nhave record in history. He kept slaves in the early days! Yes, and\r\na century ago England wished to make war on her American subjects in\r\nVirginia for refusing to take the slaves she sent. There was a time\r\nwhen we might have vaunted some superiority in the English-African\r\nmethod of dealing with the native.\r\n\r\n  THAT DAY IS PAST.\r\n\r\nThe terrible events of the last five years in South Africa have left\r\nus silent. There is undoubtedly a score laid against us on this\r\nmatter, Dutch and English South Africans alike; for the moment it is\r\nin abeyance; in fifty or a hundred years it will probably be presented\r\nfor payment as other bills are, and the white man of Africa will have\r\nto settle it. It has been run up as heavily north of the Limpopo as\r\nsouth; and when our sons stand up to settle it, it will be Dutchmen\r\nand Englishmen together who have to pay for the sins of their fathers.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of our fellow South Africans of Dutch extraction,\r\nwho to-day cover South Africa from Capetown to the Limpopo. In the\r\nCape Colony, and increasingly in the two Republics, are found enormous\r\nnumbers of cultured and polished Dutch-descended South Africans, using\r\nEnglish as their daily form of speech, and in no way distinguishable\r\nfrom the rest of the nineteenth century Europeans. Our most noted\r\njudges, our most eloquent lawyers, our most skillful physicians, are\r\nfrequently men of this blood; the lists of the yearly examinations of\r\nour Cape University are largely filled with Dutch names, and women,\r\nas well as men, rank high in the order of merit. It would sometimes\r\nalmost seem as if the long repose the people has had from the heated\r\nlife of cities, with the large tax upon the nervous system, had sent\r\nthem back to the world of intellectual occupations with more than\r\nthe ordinary grasp of power. In many cases they go home to Europe to\r\nstudy, and doubtless their college life and English friendships bind\r\nBritain close to their hearts as to ours who are English-born. The\r\npresent State Attorney of the Transvaal is a man who has taken some of\r\nthe highest honors Cambridge can bestow. Besides, there exist still\r\nour old simple farmers or Boers, found in the greatest perfection in\r\nthe midland districts of the Colony, in the Transvaal and Free State,\r\nwho constitute a large part of the virile backbone of South Africa.\r\nClinging to their old seventeenth century faiths and manners, and\r\nspeaking their African taal, they are yet tending to pass rapidly away,\r\ndisplaced by their own cultured modern children; but they still form\r\na large and powerful body. Year by year the lines dividing the South\r\nAfricans from their more lately arrived English-descent brothers are\r\n\r\n  PASSING AWAY.\r\n\r\nLove, not figuratively but literally, is obliterating the line of\r\ndistinction; month by month, week by week, one might say hour by hour,\r\nmen and women of the two races are meeting. In the Colony there are\r\nfew families which have not their Dutch or English connections by\r\nmarriage; in another generation the fusion will be complete. There will\r\nbe no Dutchmen then and no Englishmen in South Africa, but only the\r\ngreat blended South African people of the future, speaking the English\r\ntongue, and holding in reverend memory its founders of the past,\r\nwhether Dutch or English. Already, but for the sorrowful mistakes of\r\nthe last years, the line of demarcation would have faded out of sight;\r\nexternal impediments may tend to delay it, but they can never prevent\r\nthis fusion; we are one people. In thirty years’ time, the daughter of\r\nthe man who landed yesterday in South Africa will carry at her heart\r\nthe child of a de Villiers, and the son of the Cornish miner who lands\r\nthis week will have given the name of her English grandmother to his\r\ndaughter, whose mother was a le Roux. There will be nothing in forty\r\nyears but the great blended race of Africans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese South Africans, together with those of English descent, but who\r\nhave been more than two generations in the country and have had no--or\r\nvery little--personal and intimate knowledge and intercourse with\r\nEngland, may be taken as standing on one side of us. They are before\r\nall things South Africans. They have--both Dutch and English--in many\r\ncases a deep and sincere affection for the English language, English\r\ninstitutions, and a sincere affection for England herself. They are\r\ngrateful to her for her watch over their seas; and were a Russian\r\nfleet to appear in Table Bay to-morrow and attempt to land troops, it\r\nwould fly as quickly from Dutch as English bullets. Neither Dutch nor\r\nEnglish South Africans desire to see any other power installed in the\r\nplace of England. Cultured Dutch and English Africans alike are fed on\r\nEnglish literature, and England is their intellectual home. Even with\r\nour simplest Dutch-descent Africans the memories of\r\n\r\n  THE OLD BITTER DAYS\r\n\r\nhad almost faded, when the ghastly events, which are too well known to\r\nneed referring to, awoke the old ache at the heart a few years ago.\r\nBut even they would see quietly no other power standing in the place\r\nof England. “It is a strange thing,” said a well-known Dutch South\r\nAfrican to us twenty-one years ago, “that when I went to Europe to\r\nstudy I went to Holland, and loved the land and the people, but I\r\nfelt a stranger; it was the same in Germany, the same in France. But\r\nwhen I landed in England I said, ‘I am at home!’” That man was once a\r\npassionate lover of England, but he is now a heart-sore man. There have\r\nbeen representatives of England in South Africa who have been loved as\r\ndearly by the Dutch as by the English. When a few years ago there was\r\na talk of Sir George Grey visiting South Africa on his way home from\r\nNew Zealand to England, old grey-headed Dutchmen in the Free State\r\nexpressed their resolve to take one more long train journey and go down\r\nto Capetown only once more to shake the hand of the old man who more\r\nthan forty years before had been Governor of the Cape Colony. So deeply\r\nhad a great Englishman, upholding the loftiest traditions of English\r\njustice and humanity, endeared himself to the hearts of South Africans.\r\n“God’s Englishman”--not of the Stock Exchange and the Gatling gun, but\r\nof the great heart.\r\n\r\nBut great as is the bond between South Africans, whether Dutch or\r\nEnglish, and England, caused by language, sentiments, interest and the\r\nnoble record left by those large Englishmen who have labored among us,\r\nthe South African pure and simple, whether English or Dutch, cannot\r\nfeel to England just as we do. Their material interest may bind them to\r\nEngland as much as it binds us, but that deep passion for her honor,\r\nthe consciousness that she represents a large spiritual factor in our\r\nlives, which, once gone, nothing replaces for us; that her right-doing\r\nis ours, and her wrong-doing is also ours; that in a manner her flag\r\ndoes not represent anything we have an interest in, or even that we\r\nlove, but that in a curious way it is ourselves--this they cannot\r\nknow. Therefore, while on our side we are connected with them by our\r\naffection for South Africa and our resolute desire for its good, our\r\nposition remains not exactly as theirs. Our standpoint is at once\r\nbroader and more impartial in dealing with South African questions, in\r\nthat we are bound by two-fold sympathies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand of us, who are at once South Africans and Englishmen,\r\nstand in South Africa another body of individuals who are not South\r\nAfrican, in any sense or only partially, but to whom from our peculiar\r\nposition we also stand closely bound.\r\n\r\nEver since the time when England took over the Cape, there has been\r\nslowly entering the country a thin stream of new settlers, English\r\nmainly, but largely reinforced by people of other nationalities. Eighty\r\nyears ago, in 1820, a comparatively large body of Englishmen arrived\r\nat once, and are known as the British Settlers. They settled at first\r\nmainly in Albany, and certain of their descendants are to-day, in some\r\nsenses, almost as truly and typically South African as the older Dutch\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\n  THEIR LOVE FOR AFRICA\r\n\r\nis intense. Some years later a large body of Germans were brought to\r\nthe Kingwilliams town division of South Africa. They, too, became\r\nfarmers, and their descendants are already true South Africans. For\r\nthe rest, for years men continually dribbled in slowly and singly\r\nfrom other countries. Whether they came out in search of health, as\r\nclergymen, missionaries, or doctors, or in search of manual employment,\r\nor as farmers, they almost all became, or tended to become almost\r\nimmediately, South Africans. They settled in the land permanently among\r\npeople who were permanent inhabitants, they often married women born in\r\nSouth Africa, and their roots soon sank deeply into it. They brought\r\nus no new problem to South Africa. They have settled among us, living\r\nas we live, sharing our lives and interests. It is said that it takes\r\nthirty years to make a South African, and in a manner this is true.\r\nEven now, more especially in times of stress or danger, it is easy to\r\ndistinguish the African-born man from the man of whatever race and\r\nhowever long in the country who has not been born here. But in the main\r\nthese newcomers have become South Africans with quickness and to an\r\nastonishing degree, and coming in in driblets they were, so to speak,\r\neasily digested by South Africa.\r\n\r\nBut during the last few years\r\n\r\n  A NEW PHENOMENON HAS STARTED\r\n\r\nup in South African life. The discovery of vast stores of mineral\r\nwealth in South Africa, more especially gold, has attracted suddenly\r\nto its shores a large population which is not and cannot, at least\r\nat once, be South African. This body is known under the name of the\r\nUitlanders (literally “Foreigners”).\r\n\r\nThrough a misfortune, and by no fault of its own, the mass of this\r\ngold has been discovered mainly along the Witwatersrand, within the\r\nterritory of the Transvaal Republic, and more especially at the spot\r\nwhere the great mining camp of Johannesburg now stands, thus throwing\r\nupon the little Republic the main pressure of the new arrivals.\r\n\r\nTo those who know the great mining camps of Klondike and Western\r\nAmerica, it is perhaps not necessary to describe Johannesburg. Here are\r\nfound that diverse and many-shaded body of humans, who appear wherever\r\nin the world gold is discovered. The Chinaman with his pigtail, the\r\nIndian Coolie, the manly Kafir, and the Half-caste; all forms of dark\r\nand colored folk are here, and outnumber considerably the white. Nor is\r\nthe white population less multifarious and complex. On first walking\r\nthe streets, one has a strange sense of having left South Africa, and\r\nbeing merely in some cosmopolitan center, which might be anywhere where\r\nall nations and colors gather round the yellow king. Russian Jews and\r\nPoles are here by thousands, seeking in South Africa the freedom from\r\noppression that was denied that much-wronged race of men in their own\r\nbirth-land; Cornish and Northumberland miners; working men from all\r\nparts of the earth; French, German and English tradesmen; while on the\r\nStock Exchange men of every European nationality are found, though\r\nthe Jew predominates. The American strangers are not large in number,\r\nbut are represented by perhaps the most cultured and enlightened\r\nclass in the camp, the mining engineer and large importers of mining\r\nmachinery being often of that race; our lawyers and doctors are of all\r\nnationalities, while in addition to all foreigners, there is a certain\r\nadmixture of English and Dutch South Africans. In the course of a day\r\none is brought into contact with men of every species. Your household\r\nservant may be a Kafir, your washerwoman is a Half-caste, your butcher\r\nis a Hungarian, your baker English, the man who soles your boots a\r\nGerman, you buy your vegetables and fruit from an Indian Coolie, your\r\ncoals from the Chinaman round the corner, your grocer is a Russian\r\nJew, your dearest friend an American. This is an actual, and not an\r\nimaginary, description. Here are found the most noted prostitutes of\r\nChicago; and that sad sisterhood created by the dislocation of our yet\r\nuncoordinated civilization, and known in Johannesburg under the name\r\nof continental women, have thronged here in hundreds from Paris and the\r\nrest of Europe. Gambling, as in all mining camps, is rife; not merely\r\nmen but even women put their money into the totalisator, and\r\n\r\n  A LOW FEVER OF ANXIETY\r\n\r\nfor chance wealth feeds on us. Crimes of violence are not unknown; but,\r\nif one may speak with authority who has known only one other great\r\nmining center in its early condition, and whose information on this\r\nmatter has therefore been gathered largely from books, Johannesburg\r\ncompares favorably, and _very_ favorably, with other large mining\r\ncamps in the same stage of their existence. The life of culture and\r\nimpersonal thought is largely and of necessity among a new and nomadic\r\npopulation absent; art and science are of necessity unrepresented;\r\nbut a general alertness and keenness characterizes our population. In\r\nthe bulk of our miners and working men, of our young men in banks and\r\nhouses of business, we have a large mass of solid, intelligent, and\r\ninvaluable social material which counter-balances that large mass of\r\nhuman flotsam and jetsam found in this, as in all other mining camps;\r\nwhile among our professional men and mining officials is found a large\r\namount of the highest professional knowledge and efficiency. Happy\r\nwould it be for the gallant little Transvaal Republic, and well for\r\nSouth Africa as a whole, if the bulk of this little human nature could\r\nbecome ours forever, if they were here to stay with us, drink out of\r\nour cup and sup out of our platter. But in most cases this is not\r\nso. The bulk of the population, and especially its most valuable and\r\ncultured elements, are here temporarily; as persons who go to Italy\r\nor the south of France for health or sunshine, who, even when they go\r\nyear after year, or buy villas and settle there for a time, yet go to\r\nseek merely health and sunshine, not strike root there; and as men go\r\nto Italy for health and sunshine, the bulk of us here come to seek gold\r\nor a temporary livelihood, and for nothing more. Even our miners and\r\nworking men in Johannesburg, the most stable and possibly permanent\r\nelement in our population, have, in many instances, their wives and\r\nfamilies in Cornwall or elsewhere; and when they have them here they\r\nstill think of the return home for good in after years; while with\r\nthe wealthier classes this is practically universal. Not only have our\r\nleading mining engineers and the great speculators not the slightest\r\nintention of staying in Johannesburg permanently; most have their wives\r\nand families in England, America, or on the Continent, and project\r\nas soon as possible a retirement from business, and return to the\r\nfashionable circles of Europe or America. Even among South African-born\r\nmen the large majority of us intend returning to our own more lovely\r\nbirthplaces and homes in the Colony sooner or later; and the only\r\nelement which will probably form any integral part of the South African\r\nnation of the future and become subject to the Transvaal Republic is\r\nthe poorer, which, from the larger advantages for labor here, will be\r\nunable to return to its natural home.\r\n\r\nThe nomadic population of Johannesburg undoubtedly consists of men who\r\nare brave and loyal citizens in their own States and nations. To-morrow,\r\n\r\n  IF AMERICA WERE IN DANGER,\r\n\r\nprobably almost every American citizen would troop back to her bosom,\r\nand spend not only life, but the wealth he had gained in South Africa\r\nfrom South African soil, in defending her. Every German would go home\r\nto the Fatherland; every Englishman, every Frenchman, would, as all\r\nbrave men in the world’s history have done, when the cry arises, “The\r\nbirth-land in danger!” The few Spaniards here trooped back to Spain as\r\nsoon as the news of war arrived.\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant and able of English journalists (a man\r\nwhose opinion on any subject touching his own land we would receive\r\nalmost with the reverence accruing to the man who speaks of a subject\r\nhe knows well and has studied with superior abilities; but who had\r\nbeen only a few months in our land, and, therefore, had not full grasp\r\nof either our people or our problems, which from their complexity\r\nand many-sidedness are subjects for a life’s devotion) that man,\r\nthree and a half years ago, when brave little Jameson--brave, however\r\nmistaken--was sent in to capture the mines of Johannesburg for his\r\nmaster, and when the great mixed population of Johannesburg, Germans\r\nand French, English and Jews, Arabs and Chinamen, refused to arise and\r\ngo to aid him, and when hundreds of Englishmen, Cornishmen and others\r\nfled from Johannesburg, fearing that Jameson might arrive and cause a\r\ndisturbance--said that Johannesburg would be known forever in history\r\nby the name of _Judasburg!_ and that the Cornish and other Englishmen\r\nwho fled from the place were poltroons and cowards. But he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n  JOHANNESBURG IS NOT JUDASBURG,\r\n\r\nand the Englishmen who fled were not poltroons. There ran in them blood\r\nas brave as any in England, and if to-morrow a hostile force attacked\r\ntheir birth-land, those very Cornish miners and English working men\r\nwould die in the last ditch defending their land. Those men were\r\nstrangers here; they came to earn the bread they could with difficulty\r\nwin in their own land; they were friendly treated by South Africa and\r\nmade money here; but were they bound to die in a foreign land for\r\ncauses which they neither knew nor cared for?\r\n\r\nOne thing only can possibly justify war and the destruction of our\r\nfellows to the enlightened and humane denizen of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; the unavoidable conviction that by no other means can we\r\npreserve our own life and freedom from a stronger power, or defend a\r\nweaker state or individual from a stronger. Nothing can even palliate\r\nit but so intense a conviction of a right so great to be maintained\r\nthat we are willing, not merely to hire other men to fight and die for\r\nus, but to risk our own lives,\r\n\r\n  A LIFE FOR A LIFE.\r\n\r\nThis the Englishmen in Johannesburg and foreigners of all nations\r\ncould not possibly feel. They were not more bound to die to obtain\r\ncontrol of the gold mines of Johannesburg for a man already wealthy\r\nor his confederates, than to assist South Africans in defending them;\r\nor than we who visit the south of France or Italy for health should\r\nfeel ourselves bound to remain and die if war breaks out between the\r\nBonapartists and the Republicans, or the Pope and the King. If by a\r\nprocess of abstract thought we have arrived at a strong conviction of a\r\nright or human justice to be maintained by a cause with which we have\r\nno practical concern, we may feel morally compelled to take a part\r\nin it; but no man can throw it in our teeth if we refuse to die in a\r\nstrange land for\r\n\r\n  A CAUSE THAT IS NOT OURS.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen and others who refused to fight in Johannesburg, or\r\nfled rather than run the risk of remaining, pursued the only course\r\nopen to wise and honorable men. Had they resolved to remain permanently\r\nin South Africa, and to become citizens of the Transvaal Republic, the\r\ncase might have been otherwise. As it was, they could not run a knife\r\ninto the heart of a people which had hospitably received them, and\r\nattempt to destroy a land in which they had found nothing but greater\r\nwealth and material comfort than in their own; and they could also\r\nnot enter upon a deadly raid for a man whom personally the workers of\r\nJohannesburg cared nothing for, and with whom they had not a sympathy\r\nor interest in common. In leaving Johannesburg and refusing to fight,\r\nthey pursued the only course left open to them by justice and honor.\r\n\r\nRightly to understand the problem before the little Transvaal Republic\r\nto-day, it is necessary for Englishmen to imagine not merely that,\r\nwithin the space of ten or twelve years, forty millions of Russians,\r\nFrenchmen and Germans should enter England, not in driblets and in time\r\nextending over half a century, so that they might, in a measure, be\r\nabsorbed and digested into the original population, but instantaneously\r\nand at once; not merely, that the large bulk of them did not intend to\r\nremain in England, and were there merely to extract wealth; not merely,\r\nthat the bulk of this wealth was exported at once to other countries\r\nenriching Russia, France and Germany out of the products of English\r\nsoil; that would be comparatively a small matter--but, that the bulk\r\nof the wealth extracted was in the hands of a few persons, and that\r\nthese persons were opposed to the continued freedom and independence of\r\nEngland, and were attempting by the use of the wealth they extracted\r\nfrom England to stir up Russia and France against her, that through the\r\nloss of her freedom they might the better obtain the command of her\r\nwealth and lands. When the Englishman has vividly drawn this future\r\nfor himself, he will hold, as nearly as is possible, in a nutshell an\r\nimage of the problem which the people and government of the Transvaal\r\nRepublic are called on to face to-day; and we put it straightly to him\r\nwhether this problem is not one of\r\n\r\n  INFINITE COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY?\r\n\r\nMuch unfortunate misunderstanding has arisen from the simple use of\r\nthe terms “capitalist” and “monopolist” in the discussion of South\r\nAfrican matters. Without the appending of explanation, they convey a\r\nfalse impression. These terms, so familiar to the students of social\r\nphenomena in Europe and America, are generally used in connection\r\nwith a larger, but a quite distinct body of problems. The terms\r\n“capitalism,” “monopolist,” and “millionaire” are now generally\r\nassociated with the question of the forming of “trusts,” “corners,”\r\netc., and the question whether it is desirable that society should so\r\norganize itself that one man may easily obtain possession of twenty\r\nmillions, while the bulk of equally intelligent and equally laborious\r\nmen obtain little or nothing from the labor of humanity. This question\r\nis a world-wide question; it is not one in any sense peculiarly South\r\nAfrican; it is a world-wide problem, which, as the result of much\r\nthought, careful consideration and many experiments, the nations of the\r\ncivilized world will be called to adjudicate upon during the twentieth\r\ncentury; but it is not the question with which South Africa stands face\r\nto face at this moment. The question before us is not: Shall one South\r\nAfrican possess twenty millions, live in his palace, live on champagne,\r\nhave his yacht in Table Bay, and deck women with a hundred thousand\r\npounds’ worth of jewels, while the South African next door has nothing?\r\nThis is not our question. Our problem is not the problem of America.\r\nIn America there are many individuals possessing wealth amounting to\r\nmany millions, but when the United States in their entirety is taken\r\nthe £40,000,000 of the richest individual sink to nothing; and, were it\r\nthe desire of the richest millionaire in the States\r\n\r\n  TO CORRUPT AND PURCHASE\r\n\r\nthe whole population for political purposes, he could not pay so much\r\nas £1 a head to the 80,000,000 inhabitants of the country. Further, the\r\nbulk of American millionaires are American! They differ in no respect,\r\nexcept in their possession of large wealth, in interest or affections,\r\nfrom the shoemaker in the alley or the farmer at his plough. They are\r\nAmerican citizens; their fate is bound up with that of the land they\r\nlive in; their ambitions are American. If a great misfortune should\r\novertake America to-morrow there is no reason to suppose that the heart\r\nof a Rockefeller or a Vanderbilt would not ache as that of the simplest\r\ncowboy in the States. When they die, it is to American institutions\r\nthat they leave their munificent donations, and the colleges and public\r\ninstitutions of America are endowed by them. The mass even of that\r\nwealth they expend on themselves is expended in America, and, whether\r\nthey will or no, returns to the people of the country in many forms.\r\nThe millionaires of America are and remain Americans; and the J. Gould\r\nwho should expend his millions in stirring up war between the North and\r\nSouth, or in urging England to attack and slay American citizens, would\r\nbe dealt with by his fellow-subjects, whether millionaires or paupers,\r\nwith expedition. The question whether the conditions which lead to such\r\nvast accretions of fortune in the hands of private individuals is a\r\ndesirable one and of social benefit is an open one, and a fair field\r\nfor impartial discussion; but, whatever decision is arrived at with\r\nregard to millionaires and private monopoly as they exist in Europe or\r\nthe United States, it has little or no bearing on the problem of South\r\nAfrica, which is totally distinct.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa is a young country, and taken as a whole it is an arid,\r\nbarren country agriculturally. Our unrivalled climate, our sublime and\r\nrugged natural scenery,\r\n\r\n  THE JOY AND PRIDE\r\n\r\nof the South African heart, is largely the result of this very aridity\r\nand rockiness. Parts are fruitful, but we have no vast corn-producing\r\nplains, which for generations may be cultivated almost without\r\nreplenishing, as in Russia and America; we have few facilities for\r\nproducing those vast supplies of flesh which are poured forth from\r\nAustralia and New Zealand; already we import a large portion of\r\nthe grain and flesh we consume. We may, with care, become a great\r\nfruit-producing country, and create some rich and heavy wines, but,\r\non the whole, agriculturally, we are, and must remain, as compared\r\nwith most other countries, a poor nation. Nor have we any great inland\r\nlakes, seas, and rivers, or arms of the sea, to enable us to become\r\na great maritime or carrying people. One thing only we have which\r\nsaves us from being the poorest country on the earth, and should make\r\nus one of the richest. We have our vast stores of mineral wealth, of\r\ngold and diamonds, and probably of other wealth yet unfound. This is\r\nall we have. Nature has given us nothing else; we are a poor people\r\nbut for these. Out of the veins running through rocks and hills, and\r\nthe mud-beds, heavy with jewels, that lie in our arid plains, must be\r\nreared and created our great national institutions, our colleges and\r\nmuseums, our art galleries and universities; by means of these our\r\nsystem of education must be extended; and on the material side, out of\r\nthese must the great future of South Africa be built up--or not at all.\r\nThe discovery of our mineral wealth came somewhat suddenly upon us. We\r\nwere not prepared for its appearance by wise legislative enactments,\r\nas in New Zealand or some other countries. Before the people of South\r\nAfrica as a whole had had time to wake up to the truth and to learn the\r\nfirst\r\n\r\n  GREAT AND TERRIBLE LESSON,\r\n\r\nour diamonds should have taught us the gold mines of the Transvaal were\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWe South Africans, Dutch and English alike, are a curious folk, strong,\r\nbrave, with a terrible intensity and perseverance, but we are not a\r\nsharp people well versed in the movements of the speculative world. In\r\na few years the entire wealth of South Africa, its mines of gold and\r\ndiamonds, its coal fields, and even its most intractable lands, from\r\nthe lovely Hex River Valley to Magaliesberg, had largely passed into\r\nthe hands of a very small knot of speculators. In hardly any instances\r\nare they South Africans. That they were not South African-born would\r\nin itself matter less than nothing, had they thrown in their lot with\r\nus, if in sympathies, hopes, and fears they were one with us. They are\r\nnot. It is not merely that the wealth which should have made us one of\r\nthe richest peoples in the world has left us one of the poorest, and\r\nis exported to other countries, that it builds palaces in Park Lane,\r\nbuys yachts in the Mediterranean, fills the bags of the croupiers at\r\nMonte Carlo, decks foreign women with jewels, while our citizens toil\r\nin poverty; this is a small matter. But those men are not of us! That\r\nSouth Africa we love whose great future is dearer to us than our\r\nown interests, in the thought of whose great and noble destiny lies\r\nthe source of our patriotism and highest inspiration, for whose good\r\nin a far distant future we, Dutch and English alike, would sacrifice\r\nall in the present--this future is no more to them than the future of\r\nthe Galapagos Islands. We are a hunting ground to them, a field for\r\nextracting wealth, for\r\n\r\n  BUILDING UP FAME AND FORTUNE;\r\n\r\nnothing more. This matter does not touch the Transvaal alone; from the\r\nlovely Hex River Valley, east, west, north, and south, our lands are\r\nbeing taken from us, and passing into the hands of men who not only\r\ncare nothing for South Africa, but apply the vast wealth they have\r\ndrawn from South African soil in an attempt to corrupt our public life\r\nand put their own nominees into our parliaments, to grasp the reins of\r\npower, that their wealth may yet more increase. Is it strange that from\r\nthe hearts of South Africans, English and Dutch alike, there is arising\r\nan exceedingly great and bitter cry: “We have sold our birthright for\r\na mess of pottage! The lands, the mineral wealth which should have been\r\nours to build up the great Africa of the future has gone into strange\r\nhands! And they use the gold they gain out of us to enslave us; they\r\nstrike at our hearts with a sword gilded with South African gold! While\r\nthe gold and stones remained undiscovered in the bosom of our earth,\r\nit was saved up for us and for our grandchildren to build up the great\r\nfuture; it is going from us never to return; and when they have rifled\r\nour earth and picked the African bones bare as the vultures clear the\r\ncarcass of their prey, they will leave us with the broken skeleton!”\r\n\r\nI think there is no broad-minded and sympathetic man who can hear this\r\ncry without sympathy. The South African question is far other than\r\nthe question: Shall one man possess twenty millions while his brother\r\npossesses none? It is one far deeper.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is another side to the question. Nations, like\r\nindividuals, suffer, and must pay the price, yet more for their\r\nignorance and stupidity than their wilful crimes. He who sits supine\r\nand intellectually inert, while great evils are being accomplished,\r\nsins wholly as much as he whose positive action produces them, and must\r\npay the same price. The man at the helm who goes to sleep cannot blame\r\nthe rock when the ship is thrown upon it, though it be torn asunder. He\r\nshould have known the rock was there, and steered clear of it. It is\r\nperhaps natural\r\n\r\n  A GREAT BITTERNESS\r\n\r\nshould have arisen in our hearts towards the men who have disinherited\r\nus; but is it always just? Personally, and in private life, they\r\nmay be far from being inhuman or unjust; they may be rich in such\r\nqualities; at most they remain men and brothers who differ in no way\r\nfrom the majority of us. We made certain laws and regulations; they\r\ntook advantage of them for their own success; they have but pursued\r\nthe universal laws of the business world, and of the struggle of\r\ncompetition. It was we who did not defend ourselves, and must take\r\nthe consequences. As long as any of these men merely use the wealth\r\nthey extract from Africa for their own pleasures and interest, we\r\nhave not much to complain of, and must bear the fruit of our folly.\r\nThe speculators who rule in Mashonaland were wiser than we; they\r\nordained that 50 per cent of all gold mining profits should go to\r\nthe government, and they retained all diamonds found as a government\r\nmonopoly. We were not wise enough to do so, and the nation must\r\nsuffer. But poverty is not the worst thing that can overtake an\r\nindividual or a nation. In that harsh school the noblest lessons and\r\nthe sturdiest virtues are learnt. The greatest nations, like the\r\ngreatest individuals, have often been the poorest; and with wealth\r\ncomes often what is more terrible than poverty--corruption. Not all\r\nthe millionaires of Europe can prevent one man of genius being born in\r\nthis land to illuminate it; not all the gold of Africa can keep us from\r\nbeing the bravest, freest nation on earth; no man living can shut out\r\nfrom our eyes the glories of our African sky, or kill one throb of our\r\nexultant joy in our great African plains; nor can all earth prevent us\r\nfrom growing into a great, free, wise people. The faults of the past we\r\ncannot undo; but\r\n\r\n  THE FUTURE IS OURS.\r\n\r\nBut when the men, who came penniless to our shores and have acquired\r\nmillions out of our substance, are not content with their gains; when\r\nthey seek to dye the South African soil which has received them with\r\nthe blood of its citizens--when they seek her freedom--the matter is\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThis is the problem, the main weight of which has fallen on the little\r\nSouth African Republic. It was that little ship which received the main\r\nblow when eighty thousand souls of all nationalities leaped aboard at\r\nonce; and gallantly the taut little craft, if for a moment she shivered\r\nfrom stem to stern, has held on her course to shore, with all souls on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nWe put it, not to the man in the street, who, for lack of time or\r\ninterest, may have given no thought to such matters, but to all\r\nstatesmen, of whatever nationality, who have gone deeply into the\r\nproblems of social structure and the practical science of government,\r\nand to all thinkers who have devoted time and study to the elucidation\r\nof social problems and the structure of societies and nations, whether\r\nthe problem placed suddenly for solution before this little State does\r\nnot exceed in complexity and difficulty that which it has almost ever\r\nbeen a necessity that the people of any country in the past or present\r\nshould deal with? When we remember how gravely is discussed the arrival\r\nof a few hundred thousand Chinamen in America, who are soon lost in the\r\nvast bulk of the population, as a handful of chaff is lost in a bag of\r\ncorn; when we recall the fact that the appearance in England of a few\r\nthousand labouring Polish and Russian Jews amidst a vast population,\r\ninto which they will be absorbed in less than two generations forming\r\ngood and leal English subjects, has been solemnly adverted upon as\r\n\r\n  A GREAT NATIONAL CALAMITY,\r\n\r\nand measures have been weightily discussed for forcibly excluding them,\r\nit will assuredly be clear, to all impartial and truth loving minds,\r\nthat the problem which the Transvaal Republic has suddenly had to deal\r\nwith is one of transcendent complexity and difficulty. We put it to all\r\ngenerous and just spirits, whether of statesmen or thinkers, whether\r\nthe little Republic does not deserve our sympathy, the sympathy which\r\nwise minds give to all who have to deal with new and complex problems,\r\nwhere the past experience of humanity has not marked out a path--and\r\nwhether, if we touch the subject at all, it is not necessary that it\r\nshould be in that large, impartial, truth-seeking spirit, in which\r\nhumanity demands we should approach all great social difficulties and\r\nquestions?\r\n\r\nWe put it further to such intelligent minds as have impartially watched\r\nthe action and endeavors of the little Republic in dealing with its\r\ngreat problems, whether, when all the many sides and complex conditions\r\nare considered, it has not manfully and wonderfully endeavored to solve\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that when one stands looking down from the edge\r\nof this hill at the great mining camp of Johannesburg stretching\r\nbeneath, with its heaps of white sand and debris mountains high,\r\nits mining chimneys belching forth smoke, with its seventy thousand\r\nKafirs, and its eighty thousand men and women, white or colored, of all\r\nnationalities gathered here in the space of a few years, on the spot\r\nwhere fifteen years ago the Boer’s son guided his sheep to the water\r\nand the Boer’s wife sat alone at evening at the house door to watch\r\nthe sunset, we are looking upon one of the most wonderful spectacles\r\non earth. And it is wonderful; but, as we look at it, the thought\r\nalways arises within us of something more wonderful yet--the marvelous\r\nmanner in which a little nation of simple folk, living in peace in the\r\nland they loved, far from the rush of cities and the concourse of men,\r\nhave risen to the difficulties of their condition; how they, without\r\ninstruction in statecraft, or traditionary rules of policy, have risen\r\nto face their great difficulties, and have sincerely endeavored to meet\r\nthem in a large spirit, and have largely succeeded. Nothing but that\r\n\r\n  CURIOUS AND WONDERFUL INSTINCT\r\n\r\nfor statecraft and the organization and arrangement of new social\r\nconditions which seem inherent as a gift of the blood to all those\r\npeoples who took their rise in the little deltas on the northeast of\r\nthe continent of Europe, where the English and Dutch peoples alike\r\ntook their rise, could have made it possible. We do not say that\r\nthe Transvaal Republic has among its guides and rulers a Solon or a\r\nLycurgus; but it has to-day, among the men guiding its destiny, men of\r\nbrave and earnest spirit, who are seeking manfully and profoundly to\r\ndeal with the great problems before them in a wide spirit of humanity\r\nand justice. And, we do again repeat, that the strong sympathy of all\r\nearnest and thoughtful minds, not only in Africa, but in England,\r\nshould be with them.\r\n\r\nLet us take as an example one of the simplest elements of the question,\r\nthe enfranchisement of the new arrivals. Even those of us, who with\r\nthe present writer are sometimes denominated “the fanatics of the\r\nfranchise,” who hold that that state is healthiest and strongest, in\r\nthe majority of cases, in which every adult citizen, irrespective of\r\nsex or position, possesses a vote, base our assertion on the fact that\r\neach individual forming an integral part of the community has their\r\nall at stake in that community; that the woman’s stake is likely to be\r\nas large as the man’s, and the poor man’s as the rich; for each has\r\nonly his all, his life; and that their devotion to its future good,\r\nand their concern in its health is likely to be equal; that the state\r\ngains by giving voice to all its integral parts. But the ground is\r\ncut from under our feet when a large mass of persons concerned are\r\n_not_ integral portions of the State, but merely temporarily connected\r\nwith it, have no interest in its remote future, and only a commercial\r\ninterest in its present. We may hold (and we personally very strongly\r\nhold) that the moment a stranger lands in a country, however ignorant\r\nhe may be of its laws, usages, and interests, if he intends to remain\r\npermanently in it, and incorporates all his life and interest with\r\nit, he becomes an integral part of the State, and should as soon\r\nas possible be given the power of expressing his will through its\r\nlegislature; but the\r\n\r\n  PRACTICAL AND OBVIOUS DIFFICULTY\r\n\r\nat once arises of determining who, in an uncertain stream of strangers\r\nwho suddenly flow into a land, _is_ so situated! I may go to Italy,\r\naccompanied by two friends; we may hire the same house between us\r\n(to use a homely illustration); there may be no external evidence of\r\ndifference in our attitude; yet I may have determined to live and die\r\nin Italy; I may feel a most intense affection for its people and its\r\ninstitutions, and a great solicitude over its future. The first man who\r\naccompanies me may feel perfectly indifferent to land and people, and\r\nbe there merely for health, leaving again as soon as it is restored.\r\nThe second may be animated by an intense hatred of Italy and Italians;\r\nhe not only may not wish well to the nation, but may desire to see it\r\ndowntrodden by Austria, and its inhabitants destroyed. By enfranchising\r\nme the moment I arrived, the Italian nation would gain a faithful and\r\ndevoted citizen, who would sacrifice all for her in time of danger,\r\nand devote thought in times of peace; in enfranchising immediately the\r\nsecond man, they would perform an act entirely negative and indifferent\r\nwithout loss or gain either way; in enfranchising the third man,\r\nthey would perform an act of minor social suicide. Yet it would be\r\nimpossible at once, and from any superficial study to discover our\r\ndifferences!\r\n\r\n  THE GREAT SISTER REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nacross the water has met these difficulties by instituting a\r\nprobationary residence of two years, after which by taking a solemn\r\noath renouncing all allegiance to any foreign sovereign or land,\r\nmore especially to the ruler of England and the English nation, and\r\ndeclaring their wish to live and die citizens of the United States,\r\nthe new comers are, after a further residence of another three years,\r\nfully enfranchised, and become citizens of the American Republic. In\r\nthis, as in many other cases, it would appear that the great Republic\r\nhas struck on a wise and practical solution to a complex problem; and\r\nin this matter, as in many others, we, personally, should like to see\r\nthe action of the great sister Republic followed. But thoughtful minds\r\nmay suggest, on the other hand, that, while in America, at least at the\r\npresent day, the newly enfranchised burgher receives but one-sixteen\r\nmillionth of the State power and of governmental control on his\r\nenfranchisement, in a small state like the Transvaal each new burgher\r\nreceives over eight hundred times that power in the government and\r\ncontrol of the country, and that this makes a serious difference in the\r\nimportance of making sure of the loyalty and sincerity of your citizen\r\nbefore you enfranchise him. We see this, and there is something to be\r\nsaid for it. It has been held by many sincerely desirous of arriving\r\nat a just and balanced conclusion, that, in a Republic situated as the\r\nTransvaal is, a longer residence and the votes of a certain proportion\r\nof the already enfranchised citizens are necessary before the vast\r\nrights conferred by citizenship in a small purely democratic State are\r\ngranted. The terms for the enfranchisement for foreigners in England\r\nyield us no instructive analogy; for, in a country with an hereditary\r\nsovereign and an hereditary Upper House the enfranchised foreigner\r\nreceives only a minute fraction of the power conferred on the elector\r\nin a pure democracy. The little Russian Jew who has a vote given him in\r\nLondon can never become the supreme head of the State, can never sit in\r\nor vote for members of the Upper House, and receives only the minute\r\nfractional power of voting for members of the Lower. It is\r\n\r\n  IN A PURE DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nwhere the people are the sovereign and represent in themselves the\r\nhereditary ruler, the hereditary Upper House, and the Lower House\r\ncombined, that the personnel of each accredited citizen becomes all\r\nimportant. The greater the stability and immobility at one end of a\r\nState, the greater the mobility and instability which may be allowed\r\nat the other end, without endangering the stability of the State as\r\na whole, or the healthy performance of its functions. Even on this\r\ncomparatively small question of the franchise it is evident that the\r\nproblem before the little Transvaal Republic is one of much complexity,\r\nand on which minds broadly liberal and sincerely desirous of attaining\r\nto the wisest and most humane and most enlightened judgment may\r\nsincerely differ.\r\n\r\nOf those other and far more serious problems which the Republic faces\r\nin common with South Africa, there is no necessity here to speak\r\nfurther; the thoughtful mind may follow them out for itself. Time\r\nand experiment must be allowed for the balance of things to adjust\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa has need of more citizens leal and true. Whoever enters\r\nSouth Africa and desires to become one of us, to drink from our cup\r\nand sup from our platter, to mix his seed with ours and build up the\r\nSouth Africa of the future--him let us receive with open arms. From\r\ngreat mixtures of races spring great peoples. The scorned and oppressed\r\nRussian Jew, landing here to-day, vivified by our fresh South African\r\nbreezes, may yet be the progenitor of the Spinoza and Maimonides of\r\nthe great future South Africa, who shall lead the world in philosophy\r\nand thought. The pale German cobbler who with his wife and children\r\nlands to-day, so he stays with us and becomes one with us, may yet be\r\nthe father of the greater Hans Sachs of Africa; and the half-starved\r\nIrish peasant become the forerunner of our future Burkes and William\r\nPorters. The rough Cornish miner, who is looking out with surprised\r\neyes at our new South African world to-day, may yet give to us our\r\ngreatest statesmen and noblest leader. The great African nation of the\r\nfuture will have its foundations laid on stones from many lands. Even\r\nto the Coolie and the Chinaman, so he comes among us, we personally\r\nshould say: Stretch forth the hand of brotherhood. We may not desire\r\nhim, we may not intentionally bring him among us, but, so he comes to\r\nremain with us, let South Africa be home to him.\r\n\r\n“Be not unmindful to entertain strangers, for some have thereby\r\nentertained angels unawares.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe, English South Africans of to-day, who are truly South African,\r\nloving\r\n\r\n  THE LAND OF OUR BIRTH,\r\n\r\nand men inhabiting it, yet bound by intense and loving ties, not only\r\nof intellectual affinity but of personal passion, to the home-land\r\nfrom which our parents came, and where the richest formative years\r\nof our life were passed, we stand to-day midway between these two\r\ngreat sections of South African folk, the old who have been here long\r\nand the new who have only come; between the home-land of our fathers\r\nand the love-land of our birth; and it would seem as though, through\r\nno advantage of wisdom or intellectual knowledge on our part, but\r\nsimply as the result of the accident of our position and of our double\r\naffections, we are fitted to fulfil a certain function at the present\r\nday, to stand, as it were, as mediators and interpreters between those\r\nour position compels us to sympathize with and so understand, as they\r\nmay not, perhaps, be able to understand each other.\r\n\r\nEspecially at the present moment has arrived a time when it is\r\nessential that, however small we may feel is our inherent fitness for\r\nthe task, we should not shrink nor remain silent and inactive, but\r\nexert by word and action that peculiar function which our position\r\ninvests us with.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, why at this especial moment we feel it incumbent on us\r\nnot to maintain silence, and what that is which compels our action and\r\nspeech, the answer may be given in one word--WAR!\r\n\r\nThe air of South Africa is\r\n\r\n  HEAVY WITH RUMORS;\r\n\r\ninconceivable, improbable, we refuse to believe them; yet, again and\r\nagain they return.\r\n\r\nThere are some things the mind refuses seriously to entertain, as the\r\nman who has long loved and revered his mother would refuse to accept\r\nthe assertion of the first passer-by that there was any possibility of\r\nher raising up her hand to strike his wife or destroy his child. But\r\nmuch repetition may at last awaken doubt; and the man may begin to look\r\nout anxiously for further evidence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe English South Africans are stunned; we are amazed; we say there can\r\nbe no truth in it. Yet we begin to ask ourselves: “What means this\r\nunwonted tread of armed and hired soldiers on South African soil? Why\r\nare they here?” And the only answer that comes back to us, however\r\nremote and seemingly impossible is--WAR!\r\n\r\nTo-night we laugh at it, and to-morrow when we rise up it stands\r\nbefore us again, the ghastly doubt--war!--war, and in South Africa!\r\nWar--between white men and white! _War!_--Why?--Whence is the\r\ncause?--For whom?--For what?--And the question gains no answer.\r\n\r\nWe fall to considering, who gains by war?\r\n\r\nHas our race in Africa and our race in England interests so diverse\r\nthat any calamity so cataclysmic can fall upon us, as war? Is\r\nany position possible, that could make necessary that mother and\r\ndaughter must rise up in one horrible embrace, and rend, if it be\r\npossible, each other’s vitals?... Believing it impossible, we fall to\r\nconsidering, who is it gains by war?\r\n\r\nThere is peace to-day in the land; the two great white races, day by\r\nday, hour by hour, are blending their blood, and both are mixing with\r\nthe stranger. No day passes but from the veins of some Dutch South\r\nAfrican woman the English South African man’s child is being fed; not\r\na week passes but the birth cry of the English South African woman’s\r\nchild gives voice to the Dutchman’s offspring; not an hour passes but\r\non farm, and in town and village, Dutch hearts are winding about English\r\n\r\n  AND ENGLISH ABOUT DUTCH.\r\n\r\nIf the Angel of Death should spread his wings across the land and\r\nstrike dead in one night every man and woman and child of either the\r\nDutch or the English blood, leaving the other alive, the land would be\r\na land of mourning. There would be not one household nor the heart of\r\nan African born man or woman that would not be weary with grief. We\r\nshould weep the friends of our childhood, the companions of our early\r\nlife, our grandchildren, our kindred, the souls who have loved us and\r\nwhom we have loved. In destroying the one race he would have isolated\r\nthe other. Time, the great healer of all differences, is blending us\r\ninto a great mutual people, and love is moving faster than time. It is\r\nno growing hatred between Dutch and English South African born men and\r\nwomen that calls for war. On the lips of our babes we salute both races\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nThen we look round through the political world, and we ask ourselves:\r\nWhat great and terrible and sudden crime has been committed, what\r\nreckless slaughter and torture of the innocents, that blood can alone\r\nwash out blood?\r\n\r\nAnd we find none.\r\n\r\nAnd still we look, asking what great and terrible difference has\r\nsuddenly arisen, so mighty that the human intellect cannot solve it by\r\nmeans of peace, that the highest and noblest diplomacy falls powerless\r\nbefore it, and the wisdom and justice of humanity cannot reach it, save\r\nby the mother’s drawing a sword and planting it in the heart of the\r\ndaughter?\r\n\r\nWe can find none.\r\n\r\nAnd again, we ask ourselves\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nWhat is it for? Who is there that desires it? Do men shed streams of\r\nhuman blood as children cut off poppy-heads to see the white juice flow?\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nNot England! She has a great young nation’s heart to lose. She has a\r\ncable of fellowship which stretches across the seas to rupture. She has\r\ntreaties to violate. She has the great traditions of her past to part\r\nwith. Whoever plays to win, she loses.\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nNot Africa! The great young nation, quickening to-day to its first\r\nconsciousness of life, to be torn and rent, and bear upon its limb,\r\ninto its fully ripened manhood, the marks of the wounds--wounds from a\r\nmother’s hands!\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nNot the great woman whose eighty years to-night completes,[C] who would\r\ncarry with her to her grave the remembrance of the longest reign and\r\nthe purest; who would have that when the nations gather round her bier,\r\nthe whisper should go round, “That was a mother’s hand; it struck no\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nNot the brave English soldier; there are no laurels for them here.\r\nThe dying lad with hands fresh from the plough; the old man tottering\r\nto the grave, who seizes up the gun to die with it; the simple farmer\r\nwho as he falls hears yet his wife’s last whisper, “For freedom and\r\nour land!” and dies hearing it--these men can bind no laurels on a\r\nsoldier’s brow! They may be shot, not conquered--fame rests with them.\r\nGo, gallant soldiers and defend the shores of that small island that we\r\nlove; there are no laurels for you here!\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nNot we the Africans, whose hearts are knit to England. We love all.\r\nEach hired soldier’s bullet that strikes down a South African, does\r\nmore; it finds a billet here in our hearts. It takes one African’s\r\nlife--in another it kills that which will never live again.\r\n\r\n  WHO GAINS BY WAR?\r\n\r\nThere are some who _think_ they gain! In the background we catch sight\r\nof misty figures; we know the old tread; we hear the rustle of paper,\r\npassing from hand to hand, and we know the fall of gold; it is an old\r\nfamiliar sound in Africa; we know it now! There are some who _think_\r\nthey gain! Will they gain?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, “What matter who goads England on, or in whose\r\ncause she undertakes war against Africans; this at least is certain,\r\nshe can win. We have the ships, we have the men, we have the money.”\r\n\r\nWe answer, “Yes, might generally conquers--for a time at least.” The\r\ngreatest empire upon earth, on which the sun never sets, with its five\r\nhundred million subjects, may rise up in its full majesty of power and\r\nglory, and crush thirty thousand farmers. It may not be a victory, but\r\nat least it will be a slaughter. We ought to win. We have the ships,\r\nwe have the men, and we have the money. May there not be something\r\nelse we need? The Swiss had it when they fought with Austria; the three\r\nhundred had it at Thermopylae, although not a man was saved; it goes to\r\nmake a victory. Is it worth fighting if we have not got it?\r\n\r\nI suppose there is no man who to-day loves his country who has not\r\nperceived that in the life of the nation, as in the life of the\r\nindividual, the hour of external success may be the hour of irrevocable\r\nfailure, and that the hour of death, whether to nations or individuals,\r\nis often the hour of immortality. When William the Silent, with his\r\nlittle band of Dutchmen, rose up to face the whole Empire of Spain, I\r\nthink there is no man who does not recognize that the hour of their\r\ngreatest victory was not when they had conquered Spain, and hurled\r\nbackward the greatest Empire of the world to meet its slow imperial\r\ndeath; it was the hour when that little band stood alone with the\r\nwaters over their homes,\r\n\r\n  FACING DEATH AND DESPAIR,\r\n\r\nand stood, facing it. It is that hour that has made Holland immortal,\r\nand her history the property of all human hearts.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, “But what has England to fear in a campaign with a\r\ncountry like Africa? Can she not send out a hundred thousand or a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men and walk over the land? She can sweep\r\nit by mere numbers.” We answer yes--she might do it. Might generally\r\nconquers; not always. (I have seen a little _muur kat_ attacked by a\r\nmastiff, the first joint of whose leg it did not reach. I have seen it\r\ntaken in the dog’s mouth, so that hardly any part of it was visible,\r\nand thought the creature was dead. But it fastened its tiny teeth\r\ninside the dog’s throat, and the mastiff dropped it, and, mauled and\r\nwounded and covered with gore and saliva, I saw it creep back into\r\nits hole in the red African earth.) But might generally conquers,\r\nand there is no doubt that England might send out sixty or a hundred\r\nthousand hired soldiers to South Africa, and they could bombard our\r\ntowns and destroy our villages; they could shoot down men in the\r\nprime of life, and old men and boys, till there was hardly a kopje in\r\nthe country without its stain of blood, and the Karoo bushes grew up\r\ngreener on the spot where men from the midlands, who had come to help\r\ntheir fellows, fell, never to go home. I suppose it would be quite\r\npossible for the soldiers to shoot all male South Africans who appeared\r\nin arms against them. It might not be easy, a great many might fall,\r\nbut a great Empire could always import more to take their places;\r\n_we_ could not import more, because it would be our husbands and sons\r\nand fathers who were falling, and when they were done we could not\r\nproduce more. Then the war would be over. There would not be a house in\r\nAfrica--where African-born men and women lived--without its mourners,\r\nfrom Sea Point to the Limpopo; but South Africa would be pacified--as\r\nCromwell pacified Ireland three centuries ago, and she has been being\r\npacified ever since! As Virginia was pacified in 1677; its handful of\r\nmen and women in defence of their freedom were soon silenced by hired\r\nsoldiers. “I care that for the power of England,” said “a notorious\r\nand wicked rebel” called Sarah Drummond, as she took a small stick\r\nand broke it and lay it on the ground. A few months later her husband\r\nand all the men with him were made prisoners, and the war was over.\r\n“I am glad to see you,” said Berkely, the English Governor, “I have\r\nlong wished to meet you; you will be hanged in half an hour!” and he\r\nwas hanged and twenty-one others with him, and Virginia was pacified.\r\nBut a few generations later in that State of Virginia was born George\r\nWashington, and on the 19th of April, 1775, was fought the battle of\r\nLexington--“Where once the embattled farmers stood, and fired a shot,\r\nheard round the world,”--and the greatest crime and the greatest folly\r\nof England’s career was completed. England acknowledges it now. A\r\nhundred or a hundred and fifty thousand imported soldiers might walk\r\nover South Africa; it would not be an easy walk; but it could be done.\r\nThen from east and west and north and south would come men of pure\r\nEnglish blood to stand beside the boys they had played with at school\r\nand the friends they had loved; and a great despairing cry would rise\r\nfrom the heart of Africa. But we are still few. When the war was over\r\nthe imported soldiers might leave the land--not all; some must be left\r\nto keep the remaining people down. There would be quiet in the land.\r\nSouth Africa would rise up silently, and count her dead, and bury them.\r\nShe would know the places where she found them. South Africa would be\r\npeaceful. There would be silence, the silence of a long exhaustion--but\r\nnot peace! Have the dead no voices? In a thousand farm houses black\r\nrobed women would hold memory of the count, and outside under African\r\nstones would lie the African men to whom South African women gave birth\r\nunder our blue sky. There would be silence, but no peace.\r\n\r\nYou say that all the fighting men in arms might have been shot. Yes,\r\nbut what of the women? If there were left but five thousand pregnant\r\nSouth African-born women, and all the rest of their people destroyed,\r\nthose women would breed up again a race like to the first.\r\n\r\n  OH, LION-HEART OF THE NORTH,\r\n\r\ndo you not recognize your own lineage in these whelps of the South? We\r\ncannot live if we are not free!\r\n\r\nThe grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the men who lay under the\r\nstones (who will not be English then nor Dutch, but only Africans),\r\nwill say, as they pass those heaps: “There lie our fathers, or\r\ngreat-grandfathers who died in the first great War of Independence,”\r\nand the descendants of the men who lay there will be the aristocracy\r\nof Africa. Men will count back to them and say: My father or my\r\ngreat-grandfather lay in one of those graves. We shall know no more of\r\nDutch or English then, we shall know only one great African people. And\r\n_we_? We, the South Africans of to-day, who are still English, who have\r\nbeen proud to do the smallest good so it might bring honor to England,\r\nwho have vowed our vows on the honor of Englishmen, and by the faith\r\nof Englishmen--what of _us_?\r\n\r\nWhat of us? We, too, have had our vision of Empire. We have seen as in\r\na dream the Empire of England as a great banyan tree; silently with the\r\nfalling of the dew and the dropping of the rain it has extended itself;\r\nits branches have drooped down and rooted themselves in the earth; in\r\nit all the fowl of Heaven have taken refuge, and under its shade all\r\nthe beasts of the field have lain down to rest. Can we change it for an\r\nupas tree, whose leaves distill poison and which spells death to those\r\nwho have lain down in peace under its shadow?\r\n\r\nYou have no right to take our dream from us; you have no right to kill\r\nour faith! Of all the sins England will sin if she makes war on South\r\nAfrica, the greatest will be towards us.\r\n\r\nOf what importance is the honor and faith we have given her? You say,\r\nwe are but few! Yes, we are few; but all the gold of Witwatersrand\r\nwould not buy one throb of that love and devotion we have given her.\r\n\r\nDo not think that when imported soldiers walk across South African\r\nplains to take the lives of South African men and women, that it is\r\nonly African sand and African bushes that are cracking beneath their\r\ntread: at each step they are breaking the fibres, invisible as air, but\r\nstrong as steel, which bind the hearts of South Africans to England.\r\nOnce broken they can never be made whole again; they are living\r\nthings; broken, they will be dead. Each bullet which a soldier sends\r\nto the heart of a South African to take his life, wakes up another\r\nwho did not know he was an African. You will not kill us with your\r\nLee-Metfords: you will make us. There are men who do not know they love\r\na Dutchman; but the first three hundred that fall, they will know it.\r\n\r\nDo not say, “But you are English, you have nothing to fear: we have no\r\nwar with you!”\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of us, men and women, who have loved England; we\r\nwould have given our lives for her; but, rather than strike down one\r\nSouth African man fighting for freedom, we would take this right hand\r\nand hold it in the fire, till nothing was left of it but a charred and\r\nblackened bone.\r\n\r\nI know of no more graphic image in the history of the world than\r\n\r\n  THE FIGURE OF FRANKLIN\r\n\r\nwhen he stood before the Lords of Council in England, giving evidence,\r\nstriving, fighting, to save America for England. Browbeaten, flouted,\r\njeered at by the courtiers, his words hurled back at him as lies, he\r\nstood there fighting for England. England recognizes now that it was\r\nhe who tried to save an Empire for her; and that the men who flouted\r\nand browbeat him, lost it. There is nothing more pathetic than the way\r\nin which Americans who loved England, Washington and Franklin, strove\r\nto keep the maiden vessel moored close to the mother’s side, bound by\r\nthe bonds of love and sympathy, that alone could bind them. Their hands\r\nwere beaten down, bruised and bleeding, wounded by the very men they\r\ncame to save, till they let go the mother ship and drifted away on\r\ntheir own great imperial course across the seas of time.\r\n\r\nEngland knows now what those men strove to do for her, and the names of\r\nWashington and Franklin will ever stand high in honor where the English\r\ntongue is spoken. The names of Hutchinson, and North, and Grafton are\r\nnot forgotten also; it might be well for them if they were!\r\n\r\nDo not say to us: “You are Englishmen; when the war is over, you can\r\nwrap the mantle of our imperial glory round you and walk about boasting\r\nthat the victory is yours.”\r\n\r\nWe could never wrap that mantle round us again. We have worn it with\r\npride. We could never wear it then. There would be blood upon it, and\r\nthe blood would be our brothers’.\r\n\r\nWe put it to the men of England. In that day where should we be found;\r\nwe who have to maintain English honor in the South? Judge for us, and\r\nby your judgment we will abide. Remember, we are Englishmen!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking around to-day along the somewhat over-clouded horizon of South\r\nAfrican life, one figure strikes the eye, new to the circle of our\r\nexistence here; and we eye it with something of that hope and sympathy\r\nwith which a man is bound to view the new and unknown, which may be of\r\nvast possible good and beauty.\r\n\r\nWhat have we in this man, who represents English honor and English\r\nwisdom in South Africa? To a certain extent we know.\r\n\r\nWe have a man honorable in the relations of personal life, loyal to\r\nfriend, and above all charm of gold; wise with the knowledge of books\r\nand men; a man who could not violate a promise or strike in the dark.\r\nThis we know we have, and it is much to know this; but what have we\r\nmore?\r\n\r\nThe man of whom South Africa has need to-day to sustain England’s honor\r\nand her Empire of the future, is a man who must possess more than the\r\nknowledge and wisdom of the intellect.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman rules a household with none but the children of her own\r\nbody in it, her task is easy; let her obey nature and she will not\r\nfail. But the woman who finds herself in a large strange household,\r\nwhere children and step-children are blended, and where all have passed\r\nthe stage of childhood and have entered on that stage of adolescence\r\nwhere coercion can no more avail, but where sympathy and comprehension\r\nare the more needed, that woman has need of large and rare qualities\r\nspringing more from the heart than from the head. She who can win the\r\nlove of her strange household in its adolescence will keep its loyalty\r\nand sympathy when adult years are reached and will be rich indeed.\r\n\r\nThere have been Englishmen in Africa who had those qualities. Will\r\n\r\n  THIS NEW ENGLISHMAN OF OURS\r\n\r\nevince them and save an Empire for England and heal South Africa’s\r\nwounds? Are we asking too much when we turn our eyes with hope to him?\r\n\r\nFurther off also, across the sea we look with hope. The last of the\r\nrace of great statesmen was not put into the ground with the old man\r\nof Hawarden; the great breed of Chatham and Burke is not extinct; the\r\nhour must surely bring forth the man.\r\n\r\nWe look further yet with confidence, from the individual to the great\r\nheart of England, the people. The great fierce freedom-loving heart\r\nof England is not dead yet. Under a thin veneer of gold we still hear\r\nit beat. Behind the shrivelled and puny English Hyde who cries only\r\n“gold,” rises the great English Jekyll, who cries louder yet “Justice\r\nand honor.” We appeal to him; history shall not repeat itself.\r\n\r\nNearer home, we turn to one whom all South Africans are proud of, and\r\nwe would say to Paul Kruger, “Great old man, first but not last of\r\nSouth Africa’s great line of rulers, you have shown us you could fight\r\nfor freedom; show us you can win peace. On the foot of that great\r\nstatue which in the future the men and women of South Africa will raise\r\nto you let this stand written: ‘This man loved freedom, and fought\r\nfor it; but his heart was large; he could forget injuries and deal\r\ngenerously.’”\r\n\r\nAnd to our fellow Dutch South Africans, whom we have learnt to love so\r\nmuch during the time of stress and danger, we would say: “Brothers,\r\nyou have shown the world that you know how to fight; show it you know\r\nhow to govern; forget the past; in that Great Book which you have taken\r\nfor your guide in life, turn to Leviticus, and read there in the 19th\r\nchapter, 34th verse: ‘But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be\r\nunto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for\r\nye were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’”\r\n\r\nBe strong, be fearless, be patient.\r\n\r\nWe would say to you in the words of the wise dead President of the Free\r\nState which have become the symbol of South Africa, “_Wacht een beetje,\r\nalles zal recht kom._” (Wait a little, all will come right.)\r\n\r\nOn our great African flag let us emblazon these words, never to take\r\nthem down, “FREEDOM, JUSTICE, LOVE”; great are the two first, but\r\nwithout the last they are not complete.\r\n\r\n                                 Olive Schreiner,\r\n                                     2 Primrose Terrace,\r\n                                         Berea Estate,\r\n                                             Johannesburg,\r\n  June, 1899.

Vickers,\r\n\r\n  8vo, Cloth with map and illustrations, $3.50\r\n\r\n  Endorsed by the Bohemians of America, through their national\r\n  organization, as the most complete, accurate, and sympathetic\r\n  narrative of their country’s history in English.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of his stirring narrative Mr. Vickers has availed\r\nhimself largely of material derived from native sources, and he\r\ndeserves the thanks of English-reading students for having compressed\r\nso much substance into a single book.--_The Nation._\r\n\r\nMr. Vickers has rendered a great service to Bohemia in this work, and\r\nhas evidently spared no pains to make it valuable.--_Boston Herald._\r\n\r\nAs a contribution to general historical literature, Mr. Vickers’ volume\r\nis an important event.--_Chicago Evening Post._\r\n\r\nRobert H. Vickers has rendered a lasting service to the Bohemian\r\nresidents in America. * * * The body of the work bears every evidence\r\nof being a thorough and valuable contribution to Bohemian history. It\r\nis a work which fills a field hitherto altogether unoccupied.--_Chicago\r\nEvening Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARLES H. SERGEL COMPANY,\r\n  PUBLISHERS,       CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PERU,\r\n\r\nby Clements R. Markham,\r\n\r\n  C.B., F.R.S., F.S.A., President Hakluyt Society, President Royal\r\n  Geographical Society, and author of “Cuzco and Lima,” “Peru and\r\n  India,” etc.\r\n\r\n  8vo, cloth, with maps and illustrations, $2.50.\r\n\r\nThe highest authority on Peruvian history.--_The Critic._\r\n\r\nMr. Markham has done his work well, and with ardent love for his\r\nsubject. The country is a favorite one with him, and has furnished\r\nhim with matter for three monographs before the present history. In a\r\nnecessarily limited space he has given the leading facts, and taken a\r\ncomprehensive view from the earliest time, down almost to the current\r\nyear. Not the least interesting portions are the brief but strongly\r\nindividual sketches of some of the remarkable men who have figured in\r\nthe annals of Peru. In a few virile paragraphs he presents the more\r\nfamous generals, viceroys, presidents and patriots. The book is well\r\nequipped with maps, abounds with pictures, and has an appendix rich in\r\nits statistics and important documents.--_The Literary World._\r\n\r\nMr. Markham is thoroughly at home with his subject. He possesses\r\na strong, graphic style eminently suited to it, and the amount of\r\ninformation that he has managed to crowd into the space at his disposal\r\nis simply marvelous.--_New Orleans Picayune._\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARLES H. SERGEL COMPANY,\r\n  PUBLISHERS,      CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CHILE,\r\n\r\nby Anson Uriel Hancock,\r\n\r\n  Author of “Old Abraham Jackson,” “Coitlan, A Tale of the Inca World,”\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  8vo, Cloth, with map and illustrations, $2.50\r\n\r\nIt has been Mr. Hancock’s endeavour to give a “complete short history\r\nand picture of Chile in a single volume.” We may congratulate him\r\non having achieved his design. Mr. Hancock’s virtues are those of\r\npainstaking chronicler. And he has those virtues in full quantity. Not\r\nthat the author is without dramatic power. The concluding chapters\r\nof this valuable book on the ethnology, geology, agriculture,\r\ncommunications, and resources of Chile are of great interest.--_London\r\nSaturday Review._\r\n\r\nWithin the compass of less than 500 octavo pages the author gives a\r\nsuccinct and rapid narrative of the history of Chile, its institutions,\r\nthe character of its people, and its present conditions, resources and\r\noutlook. He has made a painstaking examination of authorities, and has\r\npreserved a due sense of proportion.--_Boston Journal._\r\n\r\nIt is on the period between the years 1830 and 1880, however, that the\r\ninterest of the reader will concentrate itself, and recognizing this\r\nfact Mr. Hancock has spared no pains in rendering this part of the work\r\nthe most brilliant and authentic. It is in every respect a thoroughly\r\nreadable and accurate work, dealing with the history of a country which\r\npromises to be of much greater importance among the nations of the\r\nearth.--_Philadelphia Item._\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHARLES H.
