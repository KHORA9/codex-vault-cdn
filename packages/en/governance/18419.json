They have been chosen and collected with the idea of presenting\r\na consistent and simultaneous view of the general field of British\r\npolitics in an hour of fateful decision. I have exercised full freedom\r\nin compression and in verbal correction necessary to make them easier\r\nto read. Facts and figures have been, where necessary, revised,\r\nephemeral matter eliminated, and epithets here and there reconsidered.\r\nBut opinions and arguments are unaltered; they are hereby confirmed,\r\nand I press them earnestly and insistently upon the public.\r\n\r\nWe approach what is not merely a party crisis but a national\r\nclimacteric. Never did a great people enter upon a period of trial\r\nand choice with more sincere and disinterested desire to know the\r\ntruth and to do justice in their generation. I believe they will\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n  WINSTON S.

The addresses it contains\r\ndeal with nearly all the great political topics of the last four\r\nyears--with Free Trade, Colonial Preferences, the South African\r\nsettlement, the latest and probably the final charter of trade\r\nunionism, the Miners' Bill, the measures for establishing Trade Boards\r\nand Labour Exchanges, the schemes of compulsory and voluntary\r\nassurance, and the Budget. They possess the further characteristic of\r\ndescribing and commending these proposals as \"interdependent\" parts of\r\na large and fruitful plan of Liberal statesmanship. Of this scheme the\r\nBudget is at once the foundation and the most powerful and attractive\r\nfeature. If it prospers, the social policy for which it provides\r\nprospers too. If it fails, the policy falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe material of these speeches is therefore of great importance to the\r\nfuture of democracy in this country. Let me say a word as to their\r\nauthorship. To a friendly critic they appear to present not only rare\r\nand highly trained qualities of statement and persuasion, but a unity\r\nand sincerity of thought which give them a place above mere party\r\ndialectics. Mr. Churchill's distinguished service to Liberalism has\r\nnot been long in point of years, but it opened with the first speeches\r\nhe ever delivered in the House of Commons. No competent observers of\r\npolitical activities, and of the characters and temperaments which\r\ndirect them, can have doubted from the first moment of Mr. Churchill's\r\nappearance on the stage where his moral and intellectual sympathies\r\nlay and whither they would lead him. It is a true and, indeed, an\r\nobvious comment on his career to say that he began where his father\r\nleft off--as a Democrat and a Free Trader, and that on these inherited\r\ninstincts and tendencies he has built what both his friends and his\r\nenemies expected him to build. Mr. Churchill came to Liberalism from\r\nthe same fold as Gladstone, and for the same reason--that it presented\r\nthe one field of work open to a political talent of a high stamp, and\r\nto a wide and eager outlook on the future of our social order.\r\nLiberalism and Mr. Churchill have both had good reason to congratulate\r\nthemselves on that choice, and the party which failed to draw him into\r\na disastrous and reactionary change of view has no reason to resent\r\nit. Before he became a Liberal Mr. Churchill had taken the broad views\r\nof the South African problem that his father's later opinions\r\ncommended to him, and he was properly chosen to expound to the House\r\nof Commons the plan of self-government that embodied them.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the political groundwork of these speeches is sound\r\nLiberal principle, their meaning and purpose, taken in connection with\r\nthe Budget, and the industrial reforms for which it provides, signify\r\na notable advance into places where the thinkers, the pioneers, the\r\nmen in the advanced trenches, are accustomed to dwell. Let us\r\nacknowledge, with a sense of pleasure and relief, that this is new\r\nterritory. New, that is to say, for this country; not new to the best\r\norganisations of industrial society that we know of. New as a clearly\r\nseen vision and a connected plan of British, statesmanship; not new as\r\nactual experiment in legislation, and as theory held by progressive\r\nthinkers of many schools, including some of the fathers of modern\r\nLiberal doctrine, and most of our economists. What is there in these\r\npages repugnant to writers of the type of John Mill, Jevons, and\r\nMarshall? How much of them would even be repelled by Cobden? In the\r\nmain they preach a gospel--that of national \"efficiency\"--common to\r\nall reformers, and accepted by Bismarck, the modern archetype of\r\n\"Empire-makers,\" as necessary to the consolidation of the great German\r\nnation. An average Australian or Canadian statesman would read them\r\nthrough with almost complete approval of every passage, save only\r\ntheir defence of Free Trade. Nay more; the apology for property which\r\nthey put forward--that it must be \"associated in the minds of the mass\r\nof the people with ideas of justice and reason\"--is that on which the\r\nfriends of true conservatism build when they think of the evils of\r\nmodern civilisation and the great and continuous efforts necessary to\r\nrepair them. Who does not conclude, with Mr. Churchill, that \"a more\r\nscientific, a more elaborate, a more comprehensive social\r\norganisation\" is indispensable to our country if it is to continue its\r\nmarch to greatness? Back or forward we must go.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill, indeed, has thought it wise to raise the specific point\r\nat which, in the process of seeking a finer use and adaptation of the\r\nhuman material which forms society, the progressive and reforming\r\nstatesman parts company with the dogmatic Socialist. There is no need\r\nto labour a distinction which arises from the nature and the\r\nactivities of the two forces. British Liberalism is both a mental\r\nhabit and a method of politics. Through both these characteristics it\r\nis bound to criticise a State so long as in any degree it rests on the\r\nprinciples of \"Penguin Island\"--\"respect for the rich and contempt for\r\nthe poor,\" and to modify or repeal the rights of property where they\r\nclearly conflict with human rights. But its idealism and its practical\r\nresponsibilities forbid it to accept the elimination of private\r\nenterprise and the assumption by the State of all the instruments of\r\nproduction and distribution. Socialism has great power of emotional\r\nand even religious appeal, of which it would be wise for Liberalism\r\nto take account, and it is, on the whole, a beneficent force in\r\nsociety. But as pure dogma it fits the spirit of man no more exactly\r\nthan the Shorter Catechism. As Mr. Churchill well says, both the\r\ncollectivist and the individualist principles have deep roots in human\r\nlife, and the statesman can ignore neither.\r\n\r\nIn the main, therefore, these speeches, with all their fresh\r\nbrilliancy of colouring and treatment, hold up the good old banner of\r\nsocial progress, which we erect against reactionist and revolutionist\r\nalike. The \"old Liberal\" will find the case for Free Trade, for peace,\r\nfor representative government, stated as powerfully and convincingly\r\nas he could wish. Their actual newness consists in the fact that not\r\nonly do they open up to Liberalism what it always wants--a wide domain\r\nof congenial thought and energy, but they offer it two propositions\r\nwhich it can reject only at its peril. The first is that there can and\r\nmust be a deep, sharp abridgment of the sphere of industrial life\r\nwhich has been marked out as hopeless, or as an inevitable part of the\r\nsocial system.\r\n\r\nHere the new Liberalism parts with _laissez-faire_, and those who\r\ndefend it. It assumes that the State must take in hand the problems\r\nof industrial insecurity and unemployment, and must solve them. The\r\nissue is vital. Protection has already made its bid. It will assure\r\nthe workman what is in his mind more than cheap food--namely, secure\r\nwages; it affects to give him all his life, or nearly all his life, a\r\nmarket for his labour so wide and so steady that the fear of forced\r\nidleness will almost be banished from it. The promise is false.\r\nProtection by itself has in no country annulled or seriously qualified\r\nunemployment. But the need to which it appeals is absolutely real; for\r\nthe modern State it is a problem of the Sphinx, neither to be shirked\r\nnor wrongly answered. And the alternative remedy offered in these\r\npages has already, as their author abundantly shows, succeeded even in\r\nthe very partial forms in which it has been applied. The labour market\r\ncan be steadied and equalised over a great industrial field. Part of\r\nits surplus can be provided for. What Mr. Churchill calls \"diseased\r\nindustries\" can be cut off from the main body, or restored to some\r\nmeasure of health. The State can set up a minimum standard of health\r\nand wage, below which it will not allow its citizens to sink; it can\r\nstep in and dispense employment and restorative force under strictly\r\nspecified conditions, to a small body of more or less \"sick\" workers;\r\nit can supply security for a far greater, less dependent, and more\r\nefficient mass of labourers, in recurring crises of accident,\r\nsickness, invalidity, and unemployment, and can do so with every hope\r\nof enlisting in its service voluntary forces and individual virtues of\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem of \"relief,\" it is a method of humanity, and its\r\naim is not merely to increase the mechanical force of the State, but\r\nto raise the average of character, of _morale_, in its citizens. Nor\r\ndo these speeches represent only a batch of platform promises. The\r\ngreat scheme of social betterment preached in these pages is already\r\nembodied in half a dozen Acts of Parliament, with corresponding\r\norganisations in the Board of Trade and elsewhere; and if the Budget\r\npasses, the crown can be put upon them next year or the year after by\r\nmeasures of insurance against invalidity and unemployment.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill's second proposition is the correlative of the first.\r\nHow shall this imposing fabric of industrial security be reared and\r\nmade safe? The answer is, by modifying, without vitally changing, the\r\nbasis of taxation. The workman cannot be asked to pay for everything,\r\nas under Protection he must pay. In any case, he must pay for\r\nsomething. But if he is asked for too much, the sources of physical\r\nefficiency are drained, and the main purpose of the new\r\nLiberalism--the ideal of an educated, hopeful, and vigorous people--is\r\ndestroyed. Now Liberalism, in ceasing to rely on indirect taxation as\r\nits main source of revenue, has opened up for contribution not merely\r\nthe superfluities of society, the \"accumulations of profit,\" as Mr.\r\nChurchill calls them, but those special forms of wealth which are\r\n\"social\" in origin, which depend on some monopoly of material agents,\r\non means not of helping the community but of hindering it, not of\r\nenriching its powers and resources, but of depleting them for private\r\nadvantage. In other words, the State in future will increasingly ask\r\nthe taxpayer not only \"What have you got?\" but \"How did you get it?\"\r\nNo one contends that such an analysis can be perfect; but, on the\r\nother hand, can a community desirous of realising what Goethe calls\r\n\"practical Christianity,\" ignore it? And if in this process it enters\r\nthe sphere of morals, as Ruskin long ago urged it to do, as well as\r\nthe path of economic justice, is the step a wrong one? Has it not\r\nalready been taken not only in this Budget, but in its predecessor, in\r\nwhich the Prime Minister made the memorable distinction between earned\r\nand unearned income? Those who answer these questions in the Liberal\r\nsense will find in these speeches a body of vigorous and persuasive\r\nreasoning on their side.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the main purpose of these speeches to show that\r\nLiberalism has a message of the utmost consequence to our times. They\r\nlink it afresh with the movement of life, which when it overtakes\r\nparties condemns and destroys them. They give it an immediate mission\r\nand an outlook on the wider moral domain, which belongs to no single\r\ngeneration. This double character is vital to a Party which must not\r\ndesert the larger ways in which the spirit of man walks, while it\r\nquits at its peril the work of practical, everyday service to existing\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nA word as to the literary quality of these addresses, widely varied as\r\nthey are in subject. The summit of a man's powers--his full capacity\r\nof reason, comparison, expression--are not usually reached at so\r\nearly a point in his career as that which Mr. Churchill has attained.\r\nBut in directness and clearness of thought, in the power to build up a\r\npolitical theory, and present it as an impressive and convincing\r\nargument, in the force of rhetoric and the power of sympathy, readers\r\nof these addresses will find few examples of modern English\r\nspeech-making to compare with them. They revive the almost forgotten\r\nart of oratory, and they connect it with ideas born of our age, and\r\nspringing from its conscience and its practical needs, and, above all,\r\nessential to its happiness.\r\n\r\n  H.W.

That instrument provided for representative and not\r\nresponsible government. Under that Constitution the election would\r\nhave been held in March of this year, and the Assembly would have met\r\nin June, if the home Government had not changed. But just at the time\r\nthat the Government changed in December two questions arose--the\r\nquestion of whether or not soldiers of the British Army in garrison\r\nshould be allowed to vote; and the question whether it would not be\r\nbetter to have sixty constituencies instead of thirty; and, as both\r\nquestions involved necessary alterations in the Letters Patent, the\r\ntime was ripe, quite apart from any difference which the change of the\r\nmen at the helm might make, for a reconsideration and review of the\r\nwhole form of the government which was to be given to the two\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nThe objection that must most readily occur in considering Mr.\r\nLyttelton's Constitution is that it was unworkable. It proposed that\r\nthere should be from six to nine nominated Ministers in an Assembly of\r\nthirty-five, afterwards to be increased to sixty elective members. The\r\nposition of a Minister is one of considerable difficulty. He often has\r\nto defend rather an awkward case. When favourable facts are wanting he\r\nhas to depend upon the nimbleness of his wits, and, when these fail\r\nhim, he has to fall back upon the loyalty of his supporters. But no\r\nMinister can move very far upon his road with satisfaction or success\r\nif he has not behind him either a nominated majority or an organised\r\nParty majority. Mr. Lyttelton's Ministers had neither. They would have\r\nbeen alone, hopelessly outnumbered in an Assembly, the greater part of\r\nwhich was avowedly in favour of responsible and not of representative\r\ngovernment. These Ministers, with one exception, had no previous\r\nParliamentary experience and no ascertained Parliamentary ability.\r\nThey would have been forced to carry their Bills and their Estimates\r\nthrough an Assembly in the main opposed to them. All this time, while\r\nwe should have given to these Ministers this serious duty, we should\r\nourselves have had to bear the whole responsibility in this country\r\nfor everything that was done under their authority; and their\r\nauthority could only be exerted through an Assembly which, as things\r\nstood, they could not control.\r\n\r\nThe Committee can easily imagine the telegrams and the questions which\r\nwould have been addressed from Downing Street and the House of Commons\r\nto these Ministers on native matters, on the question of the\r\nadministration of the Chinese Ordinance, on all the numerous intricate\r\nquestions with which we are at the present moment involved in South\r\nAfrica. And what would have been the position of these Ministers,\r\nfaced with these embarrassments in a hostile Assembly in which they\r\nhad few friends--what possibility would they have had of maintaining\r\nthemselves in such an Assembly? Is it not certain that they would have\r\nbroken down under the strain to which they would have been exposed,\r\nthat the Assembly would have been infuriated, that Parties differing\r\nfrom each other on every conceivable question, divided from each other\r\nby race and religion and language, would have united in common hatred\r\nof the interference of the outside Power and the government of\r\nbureaucrats. Then we should very speedily have got to the bottom of\r\nthe hill. There would have been a swift transition. The Legislative\r\nAssembly would have converted itself into a constituent Assembly, and\r\nit would have taken by force all that the Government now have it in\r\ntheir power to concede with grace, distinction, and authority. On\r\nthese grounds his Majesty's Government came to the conclusion that it\r\nwould be right to omit the stage of representative government\r\naltogether and to go directly to the stage of responsible government.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in politics as it is in war. When one crest line has\r\nbeen left, it is necessary to go to the next. To halt half-way in the\r\nvalley between is to court swift and certain destruction, and the\r\nmoment you have abandoned the safe position of a Crown Colony\r\ngovernment, or government with an adequate nominated majority, there\r\nis no stopping-place whatever on which you may rest the sole of your\r\nfoot, until you come to a responsible Legislative Assembly with an\r\nexecutive obeying that Assembly. These arguments convinced his\r\nMajesty's Government that it would be necessary to annul the Letters\r\nPatent issued on March 31, 1905, and make an end of the Lyttelton\r\nConstitution. That Constitution now passes away into the never-never\r\nland, into a sort of chilly limbo that is reserved for the disowned or\r\nabortive political progeny of many distinguished men.\r\n\r\nThe Government, and those who support them, may rejoice that we have\r\nbeen able to take this first most important step in our South African\r\npolicy with such a very general measure of agreement, with, indeed, a\r\nconsensus of opinion which almost amounts to unanimity. Both races,\r\nevery Party, every class, every section in South Africa have agreed in\r\nthe course which his Majesty's Government have adopted in abandoning\r\nrepresentative government and going at once to responsible government.\r\nThat is already a very great thing, but it was not always so. Those\r\nwho sat in the last Parliament will remember that it was not always\r\nso. We remember that Lord Milner was entirely opposed to granting\r\nresponsible government. We know that Mr. Lyttelton wrote pages and\r\npages in the Blue Book of last year proving how futile and dangerous\r\nresponsible government would be; and the right hon. Member for West\r\nBirmingham, who took the Government decision as a matter of course on\r\nthe first day of the present session, made a speech last session in\r\nwhich he indicated in terms of great gravity and force, that he\r\nthought it was wholly premature to grant responsible government to the\r\nTransvaal. But all that is abandoned now. I heard the right hon.\r\nMember for West Birmingham, in the name of the Party opposite, accept\r\nthe policy of his Majesty's Government. I heard the hon. Member for\r\nBlackpool this afternoon say that he hoped that responsible government\r\nwould be given to the Transvaal at the earliest possible moment. In\r\nregard to the Orange River Colony, it is quite true that the official\r\nOpposition, so far as I gather their view, think that it should be\r\ndelayed, and should not be given at the same time as to the Transvaal;\r\nbut that is not the view of the right hon. Member for West Birmingham.\r\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on July 27, 1905, the right hon.\r\ngentleman said:\r\n\r\n\"Objection has also been taken that the same government which is now\r\nbeing given to the Transvaal has not been given to the Orange River\r\nColony. I think that the experiment might have been far better tried\r\nin the Orange River Colony. It is quite true that in that Colony there\r\nis an enormous majority of the Dutch or Boer population. But they have\r\nshown by long experience that they are most capable and moderate\r\nadministrators--under the admirable rule of President Brand they set\r\nan example to the whole of South Africa; and although I think there is\r\nsome danger in this experiment, it is in the Orange River Colony that\r\nI myself would have been inclined, in the first instance, to take the\r\nrisk.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true the right hon. gentleman was speaking of representative\r\ngovernment; but it cannot be disputed that if an advance were to be\r\nmade in associating the people of the conquered Colonies with the\r\ngovernment of those Colonies, the right hon. gentleman thought that it\r\nhad better be in the Orange River Colony first. But at any rate now it\r\nis incontestable that there is no Party in this country or in the\r\nTransvaal that opposes the grant of responsible government to the\r\nTransvaal. That is a great advance, and shows that we have been able\r\nto take our first step with the approbation of all concerned.\r\n\r\nBut the Opposition, having abandoned their resistance to the grant of\r\nresponsible government, now contend that on no account must the basis\r\nof the Lyttelton Constitution be departed from. I am not convinced by\r\nthat argument. The Government are to pursue a new purpose, but to\r\nadhere to the old framework. We are to cut off the head of the\r\nLyttelton Constitution, but are to preserve the old trunk and graft a\r\nnew head on it. I do not believe that any Government, approaching this\r\nquestion from a new point of view, uncompromised and unfettered, would\r\nbe bound by the framework and details of the Lyttelton Constitution.\r\nIt may be that that Constitution contains many excellent principles,\r\nbut the Government have a right to consider things from the beginning,\r\nfreshly and freely, to make their own plans in accordance with their\r\nown ideas, and to present those plans for the acceptance of the House.\r\n\r\nThe noble lord the Member for South Birmingham spoke of the principle\r\nof \"one vote, one value,\" which was embodied in the Lyttelton\r\nConstitution. The principle of \"one vote, one value\" is in itself an\r\northodox and unimpeachable principle of democracy. It is a logical,\r\nnumerical principle. If the attempt be made to discriminate between\r\nman and man because one has more children and lives in the country, it\r\nwould be arguable that we should discriminate because another man has\r\nmore brains or more money, or lives in the town, or for any other of\r\nthe many reasons that differentiate one human being from another. The\r\nonly safe principle, I think, is that for electoral purposes all men\r\nare equal, and that voting power, as far as possible, should be evenly\r\ndistributed among them.\r\n\r\nIn the Transvaal the principle of \"one vote, one value\" can be made\r\noperative only upon a basis of voters. In nearly every other country\r\nin the world, population is the usual basis of distribution, for\r\npopulation is the same as electorate and electorate the same as\r\npopulation. On both bases the distribution of the constituencies would\r\nbe the same. There is, for instance, no part of this country which is\r\nmore married, or more celibate, or more prolific than any other part.\r\nIt is only in the Transvaal, this country of afflicting dualities and\r\nof curious contradictions, where everything is twisted, disturbed, and\r\nabnormal, that there is a great disparity between the distribution of\r\nseats on the basis of voters and on the basis of population. The high\r\nprice of provisions in the towns restricts the growth of urban\r\npopulation, and the dullness of the country districts appears to be\r\nfavourable to the growth of large families. It is a scientific and\r\nunimpeachable fact that, if you desire to apply the principle of \"one\r\nvote, one value\" to the Constitution of the Transvaal, that principle\r\ncan best be attained--I am not sure that it cannot only be\r\nattained--on the basis of voters, and that is the basis Mr. Lyttelton\r\ntook in the Constitution he formed.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Lyttelton's plan did not stop there. Side by side with this\r\nbasis of voters, he had an artificial franchise of L100 annual value.\r\nThat is a very much lower qualification in South Africa, than it would\r\nbe in this country, and I do not think that the franchise which Mr.\r\nLyttelton proposed could be called an undemocratic franchise, albeit\r\nthat it was an artificial franchise, because it yielded 89,000 voters\r\nout of a population of 300,000, and that is a much more fertile\r\nfranchise, even after making allowance for the abnormal conditions of\r\na new country, than we have in this country or than is the case in\r\nsome American and European States. So that I do not accuse Mr.\r\nLyttelton of having formulated an undemocratic franchise, but taking\r\nthese two points together--the unusual basis of distribution with the\r\napparently artificial franchise--acting and reacting, as they must\r\nhave done, one upon the other--there was sufficient ground to favour\r\nthe suspicion, at any rate, that something was intended in the nature\r\nof a dodge, in the nature of a trick, artificially to depress the\r\nbalance in one direction and to tilt it in the other.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with nationalities, nothing is more fatal than a dodge.\r\nWrongs will be forgiven, sufferings and losses will be forgiven or\r\nforgotten, battles will be remembered only as they recall the martial\r\nvirtues of the combatants; but anything like chicane, anything like a\r\ntrick, will always rankle. The Government are concerned in South\r\nAfrica not only to do what is fair, but to do what South Africa will\r\naccept as fair. They are concerned not merely to choose a balance\r\nwhich will deal evenly between the races, but one which will secure\r\nthe acceptance of both races.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe meet unjust charges in good heart. The permanence and security of\r\nBritish sovereignty in South Africa is not a matter of indifference to\r\nhis Majesty's Ministers. Surely no honourable Member believes that we\r\ncould wish to cheat the British race in the Transvaal of any numerical\r\npreponderance which may properly belong to them. Equally with our\r\npolitical opponents we desire to see the maintenance of British\r\nsupremacy in South Africa. But we seek to secure it by a different\r\nmethod. There is a profound difference between the schools of thought\r\nwhich exist upon South African politics in this House. We think that\r\nBritish authority in South Africa has got to stand on two legs. You\r\nhave laboured for ten years to make it stand on one. We on this side\r\nknow that if British dominion is to endure in South Africa it must\r\nendure with the assent of the Dutch, as well as of the British. We\r\nthink that the position of the Crown in South Africa, and let me add\r\nthe position of Agents and Ministers of the Crown in South Africa,\r\nshould be just as much above and remote from racial feuds, as the\r\nposition of the Crown in this country is above our Party politics. We\r\ndo not seek to pit one race against the other in the hope of profiting\r\nfrom the quarrel. We hope to build upon the reconciliation and not\r\nupon the rivalry of races. We hope that it may be our fortune so to\r\ndispose of affairs that these two valiant, strong races may dwell\r\ntogether side by side in peace and amity under the shelter of an equal\r\nflag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSVAAL CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _July 31, 1906_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my duty this afternoon, on behalf of the Government, to lay\r\nbefore the Committee the outline and character of the constitutional\r\nsettlement which we have in contemplation in regard to the lately\r\nannexed Colonies in South Africa. This is, I suppose, upon the whole,\r\nthe most considerable business with which this new Parliament has had\r\nto deal. But although no one will deny its importance, or undervalue\r\nthe keen emotions and anxieties which it excites on both sides of the\r\nHouse, and the solemn memories which it revives, yet I am persuaded\r\nthat there is no reason why we should be hotly, sharply, or bitterly\r\ndivided on the subject; on the contrary, I think its very importance\r\nmakes it incumbent on all who participate in the discussion--and I\r\nwill certainly be bound by my own precept--to cultivate and observe a\r\nstudious avoidance of anything likely to excite the ordinary\r\nrecriminations and rejoinders of Party politics and partisanship.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there is no real difference of principle between the two\r\ngreat historic Parties on this question. The late Government have\r\nrepeatedly declared that it was their intention at the earliest\r\npossible moment--laying great stress upon that phrase--to extend\r\nrepresentative and responsible institutions to the new Colonies; and\r\nbefore his Majesty's present advisers took office the only question in\r\ndispute was, When? On the debate on the Address, the right hon. Member\r\nfor West Birmingham--whose absence to-day and its cause I am quite\r\nsure are equally regretted in all parts of the House--spoke on this\r\nquestion with his customary breadth of view and courage of thought. He\r\nsaid: \"The responsibility for this decision lies with the Government\r\nnow in power. They have more knowledge than we have; and if they\r\nconsider it safe to give this large grant, and if they turn out to be\r\nright, no one will be better pleased than we. I do not think that,\r\nalthough important, this change should be described as a change in\r\ncolonial policy, but as continuity of colonial policy.\"\r\n\r\nIf, then, we are agreed upon the principle, I do not think that\r\nserious or vital differences can arise upon the method. Because, after\r\nall, no one can contend that it is right to extend responsible\r\ngovernment, but not right to extend it fairly. No one can contend that\r\nit is right to grant the forms of free institutions, and yet to\r\npreserve by some device the means of control. And so I should hope\r\nthat we may proceed in this debate without any acute divergences\r\nbecoming revealed.\r\n\r\nI am in a position to-day only to announce the decision to which the\r\nGovernment have come with respect to the Transvaal. The case of the\r\nTransvaal is urgent. It is the nerve-centre of South Africa. It is the\r\narena in which all questions of South African politics--social, moral,\r\nracial, and economic--are fought out; and this new country, so lately\r\nreclaimed from the wilderness, with a white population of less than\r\n300,000 souls, already reproduces in perfect miniature all those dark,\r\ntangled, and conflicting problems usually to be found in populous and\r\nold-established European States. The case of the Transvaal differs\r\nfundamentally from the case of the Orange River Colony. The latter\r\nhas been in the past, and will be again in the future, a tranquil\r\nagricultural State, pursuing under a wise and tolerant Government a\r\nhappy destiny of its own. All I have to say about the Orange River\r\nColony this afternoon is this--that there will be no unnecessary delay\r\nin the granting of a Constitution; and that in the granting of that\r\nConstitution we shall be animated only by a desire to secure a fair\r\nrepresentation of all classes of inhabitants in the country, and to\r\ngive effective expression to the will of the majority.\r\n\r\nWhen we came into office, we found a Constitution already prepared for\r\nthe Transvaal by the right hon. Member for St. George's, Hanover\r\nSquare.[1] That Constitution is no more. I hope the right hon.\r\ngentleman will not suspect me of any malevolence towards his\r\noffspring. I would have nourished and fostered it with a tender care;\r\nbut life was already extinct. It had ceased to breathe even before it\r\nwas born; but I trust the right hon. gentleman will console himself by\r\nremembering that there are many possibilities of constitutional\r\nsettlements lying before him in the future. After all, the Abbe\r\nSieyes, when the Constitution of 1791 was broken into pieces, was very\r\nlittle younger than the right hon. gentleman, and he had time to make\r\nand survive two new Constitutions.\r\n\r\nFrankly, what I may, for brevity's sake, call the Lyttelton\r\nConstitution was utterly unworkable. It surrendered the machinery of\r\npower; it preserved the whole burden of responsibility and\r\nadministration. Nine official gentlemen, nearly all without\r\nParliamentary experience, and I daresay without Parliamentary\r\naptitudes, without the support of that nominated majority which I am\r\nquite convinced that the right hon. Member for West Birmingham had\r\nalways contemplated in any scheme of representative government, and\r\nwithout the support of an organised party, were to be placed in a\r\nChamber of thirty-five elected members who possessed the power of the\r\npurse. The Boers would either have abstained altogether from\r\nparticipating in that Constitution, or they would have gone in only\r\nfor the purpose of wrecking it. The British party was split into two\r\nsections, and one section, the Responsibles, made public declarations\r\nof their intention to bring about a constitutional deadlock by\r\nobstruction and refusing supplies, and all the other apparatus of\r\nParliamentary discontent. In fact, the Constitution of the right hon.\r\ngentleman seemed bound inevitably to conjure up that nightmare of all\r\nmodern politicians, government resting on consent, and consent not\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nAs I told the House in May, his Majesty's Government thought it their\r\nduty to review the whole question. We thought it our duty and our\r\nright to start fair, free, and untrammelled, and we have treated the\r\nLyttelton Constitution as if it had never been. One guiding principle\r\nhas animated his Majesty's Government in their policy--to make no\r\ndifference in this grant of responsible government between Boer and\r\nBriton in South Africa. We propose to extend to both races the fullest\r\nprivileges and rights of British citizenship; and we intend to make no\r\ndiscrimination in the grant of that great boon, between the men who\r\nhave fought most loyally for us and those who have resisted the\r\nBritish arms with the most desperate courage. By the Treaty of\r\nVereeniging, in which the peace between the Dutch and British races\r\nwas declared for ever, by Article 1 of that treaty the flower of the\r\nBoer nation and its most renowned leaders recognised the lawful\r\nauthority of his Majesty King Edward VII, and henceforth, from that\r\nmoment, British supremacy in South Africa stood on the sure\r\nfoundations of military honour and warlike achievement.\r\n\r\nThis decision in favour of even-handed dealing arises from no\r\ningratitude on our part towards those who have nobly sustained the\r\nBritish cause in years gone by. It involves no injustice to the\r\nBritish population of the Transvaal. We have been careful at each\r\npoint of this constitutional settlement to secure for the British\r\nevery advantage that they may justly claim. But the future of South\r\nAfrica, and, I will add, its permanent inclusion in the British\r\nEmpire, demand that the King should be equally Sovereign of both\r\nraces, and that both races should learn to look upon this country as\r\ntheir friend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I last spoke in this House on the question of the South African\r\nConstitution, I took occasion to affirm the excellence of the general\r\nprinciple, one vote one value. I pointed out that it was a logical and\r\nunimpeachable principle to act upon; that the only safe rule for\r\ndoing justice electorally between man and man was to assume--a large\r\nassumption in some cases--that all men are equal and that all\r\ndiscriminations between them are unhealthy and undemocratic. Now the\r\nprinciple of one vote one value can be applied and realised in this\r\ncountry, either upon the basis of population, or upon the basis of\r\nvoters. It makes no difference which is selected; for there is no part\r\nof this country which is more married, or more prolific than another,\r\nand exactly the same distribution and exactly the same number of\r\nmembers would result whether the voters or the population basis were\r\ntaken in a Redistribution Bill. But in South Africa the disparity of\r\nconditions between the new population and the old makes a very great\r\ndifference between the urban and the rural populations, and it is\r\nundoubtedly true that if it be desired to preserve the principle of\r\none vote one value, it is the voters' basis and not the population\r\nbasis that must be taken in the Transvaal--and that is the basis which\r\nhis Majesty's Government have determined to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. gentleman the Member for St. George's, Hanover Square,\r\nhad proposed to establish a franchise qualification of L100 annual\r\nvalue. That is not nearly such a high property-qualification as it would\r\nbe in this country. I do not quarrel with the right hon. gentleman's\r\nConstitution on the ground that his franchise was not perfectly fair, or\r\nnot a perfectly _bona fide_ and generous measure of representation. But\r\nit is undoubtedly true that a property-qualification of L100 annual\r\nvalue told more severely against the Boers than against the British,\r\nbecause living in the towns is so expensive that almost everybody who\r\nlives in the towns, and who is not utterly destitute, has a\r\nproperty-qualification of L100 annual value. But in the country\r\ndistricts there are numbers of men, very poor but perfectly respectable\r\nand worthy citizens--day labourers, farmers' sons, and others--who would\r\nnot have that qualification, and who consequently would have been\r\nexcluded by the property-qualification, low as it is having regard to\r\nthe conditions in South Africa. Quite apart from South African questions\r\nand affairs, his Majesty's Government profess a strong preference for\r\nthe principle of manhood suffrage as against any property-qualification,\r\nand we have therefore determined that manhood suffrage shall be the\r\nbasis on which votes are distributed.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the prolonged negotiations and discussions which\r\nhave taken place upon this question manhood suffrage has been demanded\r\nby one party and the voters' basis by the other, and there has been a\r\ntacit, though quite informal agreement that the one principle should\r\nbalance the other. But that is not the position of his Majesty's\r\nGovernment in regard to either of these propositions. We defend both\r\non their merits. We defend \"one vote, one value,\" and we defend\r\nmanhood suffrage, strictly on their merits as just and equitable\r\nprinciples between man and man throughout the Transvaal. We have\r\ntherefore decided that all adult males of twenty-one years of age, who\r\nhave resided in the Transvaal for six months, who do not belong to the\r\nBritish garrison--should be permitted to vote under the secrecy of the\r\nballot for the election of Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nNow there is one subject to which I must refer incidentally. The\r\nquestion of female suffrage has been brought to the notice of various\r\nmembers of the Government on various occasions and in various ways.\r\nWe have very carefully considered that matter, and we have come to the\r\nconclusion that it would not be right for us to subject a young\r\nColony, unable to speak for itself, to the hazards of an experiment\r\nwhich we have not had the gallantry to undergo ourselves; and we shall\r\nleave that question to the new Legislature to determine.\r\n\r\nI come now to the question of electoral divisions. There are two\r\nalternatives before us on this branch of the subject--equal electoral\r\nareas or the old magisterial districts. When I say \"old,\" I mean old\r\nin the sense that they are existing magisterial districts. There are\r\narguments for both of these courses. Equal electoral areas have the\r\nadvantage of being symmetrical and are capable of more strict and\r\nmathematical distribution. But the Boers have expressed a very strong\r\ndesire to have the old magisterial districts preserved. I think it is\r\nrather a sentimental view on their part, because upon the whole I\r\nthink the wastage of Boer votes will, owing to excessive plurality in\r\ncertain divisions, be slightly greater in the old magisterial\r\ndistricts than in equal electoral areas. The Boers have, however, been\r\nvery anxious that the old areas of their former Constitution, of\r\ntheir local life, should be interfered with as little as possible, and\r\nthat is a matter of serious concern to his Majesty's Government.\r\nFurther, there is a great saving of precious time and expense in\r\navoiding the extra work of new delimitation which would be necessary\r\nif the country were to be cut up into equal mathematical electoral\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nThe decision to adopt the old magisterial areas, which divide the\r\nTransvaal into sixteen electoral divisions, of which the Witwatersrand\r\nis only one, involves another question. How are you to subdivide these\r\nmagisterial districts for the purpose of allocating members? Some will\r\nhave two, some three, some a number of members; and on what system\r\nwill you allocate the members to these divisions? We have considered\r\nthe question of proportional representation. It is the only perfect\r\nway in which minorities of every shade and view and interest can\r\nreceive effective representation. And Lord Elgin was careful to\r\ninstruct the Committee as a special point to inquire into the\r\npossibility of adopting the system of proportional representation. The\r\nCommittee examined many witnesses, and went most thoroughly into this\r\nquestion. They, however, advise us that there is absolutely no support\r\nfor such a proposal in the Transvaal, and that its adoption--I will\r\nnot say its imposition--would be unpopular and incomprehensible\r\nthroughout the country. If a scientific or proportional representation\r\ncannot be adopted, then I say unhesitatingly that the next best way of\r\nprotecting minorities is to go straight for single-member seats. Some\r\nof us have experience of double-barrelled seats in this country; there\r\nused to be several three-barrelled seats. But I am convinced that if\r\neither of those two systems had been applied to the electoral\r\ndivisions of the Transvaal, it would only have led to the swamping of\r\none or two local minorities which with single-member divisions would\r\nhave returned just that very class of moderate, independent, Dutch or\r\nBritish Members whom we particularly desire to see represented in the\r\nnew Assembly. Therefore, with the desire of not extinguishing these\r\nlocal minorities, his Majesty's Government have decided that\r\nsingle-member constituencies, or man against man, shall be the rule in\r\nthe Transvaal. But I should add that the subdivision of these\r\nelectoral districts into their respective constituencies will not\r\nproceed upon hard mathematical lines, but that they will be grouped\r\ntogether in accordance with the existing field cornetcies of which\r\nthey are composed, as that will involve as little change as possible\r\nin the ideas of the rural population and in the existing boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe Committee will realise that this is a question with an elusive\r\nclimax. It is like going up a mountain. Each successive peak appears\r\nin turn the summit, and yet there is always another pinnacle beyond.\r\nWe have now settled that the Members are to be allotted to\r\nsingle-member constituencies based on the old magisterial districts\r\naccording to the adult male residents there. But how are we to apply\r\nthat principle? How are we to find out how many adult males there are\r\nin each of the districts of the country, and so to find the quota of\r\nelectors or proper number of Members for each division? The proverbial\r\nthree alternatives present themselves. We might take the Lyttelton\r\nvoters' list revised and supplemented. We might make a new voters'\r\nlist, or we might take the census of 1904.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLord Selborne has pointed out to us that it might take just as long a\r\ntime to revise the Lyttelton voters' list as to make a new voters'\r\nlist, which would occupy seven months. So that, with the necessary\r\ninterval for the arrangements for election, ten months would elapse\r\nbefore the Transvaal would be able to possess responsible\r\ninstitutions. I think we shall have the assent of all South African\r\nparties in our desire to avoid that delay. I am sorry that so much\r\ndelay has already taken place. It was necessary that the Cabinet\r\nshould secure complete information. But to keep a country seething on\r\nthe verge of an exciting general election is very prejudicial to\r\ntrade. It increases agitation and impedes the healthy process of\r\ndevelopment. We are bound to terminate the uncertainty at the earliest\r\npossible moment; and we have therefore determined to adopt the census\r\nof 1904.\r\n\r\nLet me ask the Committee now to examine the sixteen magisterial\r\ndistricts. I think it is necessary to do so before allocating the\r\nMembers amongst them. In all the discussions in South Africa these\r\nhave been divided into three areas--the Witwatersrand, Pretoria, and\r\nthe \"Rest of the Transvaal.\" Pretoria is the metropolis of the\r\nTransvaal. It has a very independent public opinion of its own; it is\r\nstrongly British, and it is rapidly increasing. It is believed that\r\nPretoria will return three, four, or five Members of the Responsible\r\nParty, which is the moderate British Party, and is independent of and\r\ndetached from the Progressive Association. The \"Rest of the Transvaal\"\r\nconsists of the old constituencies who sent Boer Members to the old\r\nLegislature. There will, however, be one or two seats which may be won\r\nby Progressive or Responsible British candidates, but in general \"The\r\nrest of the country\" will return a compact body of members of Het\r\nVolk.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I now come to the Rand. We must consider the Rand\r\nwithout any bias or prejudice whatever. The Rand is not a town or\r\ncity, but a mining district covering 1,600 square miles, whose\r\npopulation of adult males practically balances the whole of the rest\r\nof the country. The Rand population is not, as some people imagine, a\r\nforeign population. The great majority of it is British, and a very\r\nlarge portion of it consists of as good, honest, hard-working men as\r\nare to be found in any constituency in this country. But there are\r\nalso on the Rand a considerable proportion of Dutch. Krugersdorp Rural\r\nis Dutch, and has always been excluded from the Rand in the\r\ndiscussions that have taken place in South Africa, and included in the\r\n\"Rest of the Transvaal.\" But in addition to that there are the towns\r\nof Fordsburgh, which is half Dutch, and two other suburbs which also\r\nhave a Dutch population; and it is believed that these will afford\r\nseats for members of the Responsible British Party with the support of\r\nHet Volk. I must say further that the British community upon the Rand\r\nis divided into four main political parties. There is the Transvaal\r\nProgressive Association, a great and powerful association which arises\r\nout of the mining interest. There is the Responsible Government\r\nAssociation; there is the Transvaal Political Association--a moderate\r\nbody standing between the Responsibles and the Progressives--and there\r\nare the labour associations, which are numerous. There are three main\r\nlabour associations, or really four--the Independent Labour Party, the\r\nTransvaal Labour League, the Trade and Labour Council of the\r\nWitwatersrand, and the Trade and Labour Council of Pretoria. Why do I\r\nbring these facts before the Committee? I do so because I feel it\r\nnecessary to show how impossible it is to try to dismiss the problems\r\nof this complicated community with a gesture or to solve their\r\ndifficulties with a phrase, and how unfair it would be to deprive such\r\na community, in which there are at work all the counter-checks and\r\nrival forces that we see here in our own political life, of its proper\r\nshare of representation.\r\n\r\nApplying the adult male list in the census of 1904 to the three areas\r\nI have spoken of, I should allot thirty-two Members to the Rand, six\r\nto Pretoria, and thirty to the rest of the country; or, if you include\r\nKrugersdorp Rural in the Rand, it would read thirty-three to the Rand,\r\nsix to Pretoria, and twenty-nine to the rest of the country. Arrived\r\nat that point, the Committee in South Africa had good hopes, not\r\nmerely of arriving at a just settlement, but of arriving at an\r\nagreement between all the parties. I am not going to afflict the House\r\nwith a chronicle of the negotiations which took place. They were\r\nfruitless. It is enough to say that there were good hopes that if the\r\nProgressive complaint, that the adoption of the census of 1904 did not\r\nallow for the increase in the population which has taken place since\r\nthe census was taken, could be met, a general agreement could be\r\nreached. The Boers, whose belief that we were going to treat them\r\nfairly and justly has been a pleasant feature in the whole of these\r\nnegotiations, and will, believe me, be an inestimable factor of value\r\nin the future history of South Africa--the Boers with reluctance and\r\nunder pressure, but guided by the Committee, with whom they were on\r\nfriendly terms, were willing to agree to a distribution which allotted\r\none more seat to meet this increase of the population in the\r\nWitwatersrand area, and the proposal then became 33, 6, and 30, or,\r\nincluding Krugersdorp Rural, 34, 6, 29. The Responsible Party agreed\r\nto that. The Progressives hesitated. The great majority of them\r\ncertainly wished to come in and come to a general agreement on those\r\nterms. Certain leaders, however, stood out for one or two or three\r\nseats more, and, although Lord Selborne expressed the opinion that the\r\narrangement proposed, namely, 33, 6, 30, excluding Krugersdorp Rural,\r\nwas a perfectly fair one to the British vote in the Transvaal, those\r\nleaders still remained unconvinced and obdurate, and all hopes of a\r\ndefinite agreement fell through.\r\n\r\nThe Committee returned to this country, bringing with them the\r\nrecommendation that the Government on their own responsibility should\r\nfix the allocation of seats at that very point where the agreement of\r\none Party was still preserved and where the agreement of the other was\r\nso very nearly won. And that is what we have decided to do. We have\r\ndecided to allocate thirty-four seats, including Krugersdorp Rural, to\r\nthe Rand, six to Pretoria, and twenty-nine to the rest of the country.\r\nLord Selborne wishes it to be known that he concurs in this\r\narrangement. Now I am quite ready to admit that every Constitution\r\nought to rest either upon symmetry or upon acceptance. Our Transvaal\r\nConstitution does not rest upon either symmetry or acceptance, but it\r\nis very near symmetry and very near acceptance, and in so far as it\r\nhas departed from symmetry it has moved towards acceptance, and is\r\nfurthermore sustained throughout by fair dealing, for I am honestly\r\nconvinced that the addition of an extra member to the Witwatersrand\r\nareas which has been made is justified by the increase of the\r\npopulation which has taken place since the census.\r\n\r\nOn such a basis as this the Transvaal Assembly will be created. It\r\nwill consist of sixty-nine members, who will receive for their\r\nservices adequate payment. They will be elected for five years. The\r\nSpeaker will vacate his seat after being elected. The reason for that\r\nprovision is that the majority in this Parliament, as in the Cape\r\nParliament, with which the government is carried on, is likely to be\r\nvery small, and it would be a great hardship if the Party in power\r\nwere to deprive itself of one of the two or three votes which, when\r\nParties are evenly balanced, are necessary for carrying on the\r\ngovernment. It would be a great disaster if we had in the Transvaal a\r\nsuccession of weak Ministries going out upon a single vote, one way or\r\nthe other. And it is found that when Parties have a very small\r\nmajority and are forced to part with one of their Members for the\r\npurpose of filling the chair, they do not always select the Member who\r\nis best suited to that high office, but the Member who can best be\r\nspared.\r\n\r\nNow let me come to the question of language. Under the Constitution of\r\nthe right hon. gentleman the Member for St. George's, Hanover Square,\r\nthe Members of the Assembly would have been permitted to speak Dutch\r\nif they asked permission and obtained permission from the Speaker. We\r\nare not able to lend ourselves to that condition. We are of opinion\r\nthat such a discrimination would be invidious. The recognition of\r\ntheir language is precious to a small people. I have never been able\r\nto work myself into a passion because there are in parts of South\r\nAfrica Dutch people who wish to have Dutch teachers to teach Dutch\r\nchildren Dutch. I have not so poor an opinion of the English language,\r\nwith its priceless literary treasures and its world-wide business\r\nconnections, as not to believe that it can safely be exposed to the\r\nopen competition of a dialect like the _taal_. We believe that the\r\nonly sure way to preserve in the years that are to come such a\r\nlanguage as the _taal_ would be to make it a proscribed language,\r\nwhich would be spoken by the people with deliberation and with malice,\r\nas a protest against what they regarded, and would rightly regard, as\r\nan act of intolerance. Therefore we have decided to follow the Cape\r\npractice and allow the members of the Transvaal Parliament to address\r\nthat Assembly indifferently in Dutch or English.\r\n\r\nI shall be asked what will be the result of the arrangement that we\r\nhave made. I decline to speculate or prophesy on that point. It would\r\nbe indecent and improper. I cannot even tell in this country at the\r\nnext election how large the Liberal majority will be. Still less would\r\nI recommend hon. gentlemen here to forecast the results of contests in\r\nwhich they will not be candidates. I cannot tell how the British in\r\nthe Transvaal will vote. There are a great many new questions, social\r\nand economic, which are beginning to apply a salutary counter-irritant\r\nto old racial sores. The division between the two races, thank God, is\r\nnot quite so clear-cut as it used to be. But this I know--that as\r\nthere are undoubtedly more British voters in the Transvaal than there\r\nare Dutch, and as these British voters have not at any point in the\r\nConstitutional Settlement been treated unfairly, it will be easily\r\nwithin their power to obtain a British majority, if they all combine\r\nto obtain it. I nourish the hope that the Government that will be\r\ncalled into life by these elections will be a coalition Government\r\nwith some moderate leader acceptable to both parties, and a Government\r\nwhich embraces in its Party members of both races. Such a solution\r\nwould be a godsend to South Africa. But whatever may be the outcome,\r\nhis Majesty's Government are confident that the Ministers who may be\r\nsummoned, from whatever Party they may be drawn, to whatever race they\r\nmay belong, will in no circumstances fail in their duty to the Crown.\r\n\r\nI should like to say also that this Parliament will be of a high\r\nrepresentative authority, and it will be the duty of whoever may be\r\ncalled upon to represent Colonial business in this House to stand\r\nbetween that Parliament and all unjustifiable interference from\r\nwhatever quarters of the House it may come.\r\n\r\nI now approach the question of the Second Chamber. That is not a very\r\nattractive subject. We on this side of the House are not particularly\r\nenamoured of Second Chambers, and I do not know that our love for\r\nthese institutions will grow sweeter as the years pass by. But we have\r\nto be governed by colonial practice; and there is no colony in the\r\nEmpire that has not a Second Chamber. The greater number of these\r\nSecond Chambers are nominated; and I think that the quality of\r\nnominated Second Chambers, and their use in practice, have not been\r\nfound to be inferior to those of the elective bodies. His Majesty's\r\nGovernment desire to secure, if they can, some special protection for\r\nnative interests which is not likely to be afforded by any electoral\r\narrangement, I am sorry to say. We are unable however to countenance\r\nthe creation in a permanent form of a nominated Second Chamber. But in\r\nview of the position of native affairs, in view of the disadvantage of\r\ncomplicating the elections, to which all classes in the Transvaal have\r\nbeen so long looking forward, and most particularly because of the\r\nextra delays that would be involved in the creation of a new elective\r\nbody, the Cabinet have resolved for this Parliament only, and as a\r\npurely provisional arrangement, to institute a nominated Legislative\r\nCouncil of fifteen members. They will be nominated by the Crown, that\r\nis to say at home, and vacancies, if any, by death or resignation,\r\nwill be filled by the High Commissioner, on the advice of the\r\nresponsible Ministers. During the course of the first Parliament in\r\nthe Transvaal arrangements will be completed for the establishment of\r\nan elective Second Chamber, and if necessary further Letters Patent\r\nwill be issued to constitute it.\r\n\r\nUnder the Treaty of Vereeniging we undertook that no franchise should\r\nbe extended to natives before the grant of self-government. I am not\r\ngoing to plunge into the argument as to what word the \"native\" means,\r\nin its legal or technical character, because in regard to such a\r\ntreaty, upon which we are relying for such grave issues, we must be\r\nbound very largely by the interpretation which the other party places\r\nupon it; and it is undoubted that the Boers would regard it as a\r\nbreach of that treaty, if the franchise were in the first instance\r\nextended to any persons who are not white men. We may regret that\r\ndecision. We may regret that there is no willingness in the Transvaal\r\nand Orange River Colony to make arrangements which have been found not\r\naltogether harmful in Cape Colony. But we are bound by this treaty.\r\nMeanwhile we make certain reservations. Any legislation which imposes\r\ndisabilities on natives which are not imposed on Europeans will be\r\nreserved to the Secretary of State, and the Governor will not give his\r\nassent before receiving the Secretary of State's decision. Legislation\r\nthat will effect the alienation of native lands will also be reserved.\r\nIt is customary to make some provision in money for native interests,\r\nsuch as education, by reserving a certain sum for administration by\r\nthe High Commissioner or some other political or Imperial official. We\r\npropose to reserve Swaziland to the direct administration of the High\r\nCommissioner, with the limiting provision that no settlement he may\r\nmake is to be less advantageous to the natives than the existing\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 1906, the arrangement for recruiting Chinese in China\r\nwill cease and determine. Our consuls will withdraw the powers they\r\nhave delegated to the mining agents, and I earnestly trust that no\r\nBritish Government will ever renew them. A clause in the Constitution\r\nwill provide for the abrogation of the existing Chinese Labour\r\nOrdinance after a reasonable interval. I am not yet in a position to\r\nsay what will be a reasonable interval, but time must be given to the\r\nnew Assembly to take stock of the position and to consider the labour\r\nquestion as a whole. I said just now there would be a clause with\r\nregard to differential legislation as between white persons and\r\nothers, and to this clause will be added the words: \"No law will be\r\nassented to which sanctions any condition of service or residence of a\r\nservile character.\" We have been invited to use the word \"slavery\" or\r\nthe words \"semblance of slavery,\" but such expressions would be\r\nneedlessly wounding, and the words we have chosen are much more\r\neffective, because much more precise and much more restrained, and\r\nthey point an accurate forefinger at the very evil we desire to\r\nprevent.\r\n\r\nI have now finished laying before the House the constitutional\r\nsettlement, and I should like to say that our proposals are\r\ninterdependent. They must be considered as a whole; they must be\r\naccepted or rejected as a whole. I say this in no spirit of disrespect\r\nto the Committee, because evidently it is a matter which the Executive\r\nGovernment should decide on its own responsibility; and if the policy\r\nwhich we declare were changed, new men would have to be found to carry\r\nout another plan. We are prepared to make this settlement in the name\r\nof the Liberal Party. That is sufficient authority for us; but there\r\nis a higher authority which we should earnestly desire to obtain. I\r\nmake no appeal, but I address myself particularly to the right hon.\r\ngentlemen who sit opposite, who are long versed in public affairs, and\r\nwho will not be able all their lives to escape from a heavy South\r\nAfrican responsibility. They are the accepted guides of a Party\r\nwhich, though in a minority in this House, nevertheless embodies\r\nnearly half the nation. I will ask them seriously whether they will\r\nnot pause before they commit themselves to violent or rash\r\ndenunciations of this great arrangement. I will ask them, further,\r\nwhether they cannot join with us to invest the grant of a free\r\nConstitution to the Transvaal with something of a national sanction.\r\nWith all our majority we can only make it the gift of a Party; they\r\ncan make it the gift of England. And if that were so, I am quite sure\r\nthat all those inestimable blessings which we confidently hope will\r\nflow from this decision, will be gained more surely and much more\r\nspeedily; and the first real step will have been taken to withdraw\r\nSouth African affairs from the arena of British party politics, in\r\nwhich they have inflicted injury on both political parties and in\r\nwhich they have suffered grievous injury themselves. I ask that that\r\nmay be considered; but in any case we are prepared to go forward\r\nalone, and Letters Patent will be issued in strict conformity with the\r\nsettlement I have explained this afternoon if we should continue to\r\nenjoy the support of a Parliamentary majority.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Lyttelton had meanwhile been elected for that Constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE FREE STATE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _December 17, 1906_\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters Patent have been issued during the last week conferring a\r\nConstitution upon the Transvaal Colony. These instruments have now\r\nbeen for some days at the disposal of the House, and this afternoon\r\naffords an occasion for their discussion. Other Letters Patent\r\nconferring a Constitution upon the Orange River Colony are in an\r\nadvanced state of preparation, and I think it would be generally\r\nconvenient if I were to make a statement as to the character and scope\r\nof that Constitution. With that view I have, by the direction of the\r\nPrime Minister, placed upon the Paper a Resolution which I now move,\r\npermitting a general discussion upon the constitutional arrangements\r\nwhich we are making both in the Transvaal and in the Orange River\r\nColony. Now, Sir, by the Treaty of Vereeniging, Great Britain\r\npromised full self-government to the peoples of the two Boer Republics\r\nwhich had been conquered and annexed as the result of the war. This\r\nintention of giving responsible government did not arise out of the\r\nterms of peace, although it is, of course, solemnly expressed in them.\r\nIt has always been the settled and successful colonial policy of this\r\ncountry during the last fifty years to allow great liberties of\r\nself-government to distant communities under the Crown, and no\r\nresponsible statesman, and no British Cabinet, so far as I know, ever\r\ncontemplated any other solution of the South African problem but that\r\nof full self-government. The idea which I have seen put forward in\r\nsome quarters, that, in order to get full satisfaction for the expense\r\nand the exertions to which we were put in the war, we are bound to\r\ncontinue governing those peoples according to our pleasure and against\r\ntheir will, and that that is, as it were, an agreeable exercise which\r\nis to be some compensation for our labours, is an idea which no doubt\r\nfinds expression in the columns of certain newspapers, but to which I\r\ndo not think any serious person ever gave any countenance. No, Sir,\r\nthe ultimate object, namely, the bestowal of full self-government,\r\nwas not lost sight of even in the height of the war; and as all\r\nparties were agreed that some interval for reconstruction must\r\nnecessarily intervene, the only questions at issue between us have\r\nbeen questions of manner and questions of time.\r\n\r\nHow much difference is there between Parties in this House as to time?\r\nIt is now more than three years since Lord Milner, speaking in the\r\nInter-colonial Council, bore emphatic testimony to the faithfulness\r\nwith which the Boers--those who had been fighting against us--had\r\nobserved their side of the terms of peace. Lord Milner said:\r\n\r\n\"It is perfectly true that the Boer population, the men who signed the\r\nterms of peace at Vereeniging, have loyally observed those terms and\r\nhave carried them out faithfully. They profess to-day, and I\r\nabsolutely believe them, that no idea of an armed rising or unlawful\r\naction is in their minds. I may say I am in constant, perhaps I should\r\nsay frequent communication with the men who in the war fought us so\r\nmanfully and then made manful terms. We differ on many points, no\r\ndoubt, and I do not expect them to rejoice with us in what has\r\nhappened, or to feel affection for a man who, like myself, has been\r\ninstrumental in bringing about the great change which has come over\r\nthe Constitution of the country. But I firmly believe their word when\r\nthey come forward and meet us, and, without professing to agree in all\r\nrespects with the policy of the Government, declare that they desire\r\nto co-operate in all questions affecting the prosperity of the country\r\nand the maintenance of public order. I accept the assurance they give\r\nin that respect, and I think it is practically impossible to put your\r\nhands on anything done by myself or any member of the Government which\r\ncan be regarded as a manifestation of distrust of the men who have\r\nshown themselves, and do show themselves, men of honour. Let me say,\r\nthen, I am perfectly satisfied that so great is the influence of their\r\nleaders over the minds of the main section of the Boer population that\r\nso long as those leaders maintain that attitude a general rising is\r\nout of the question.\"\r\n\r\nThose are the words which Lord Milner used three years ago, and I think\r\nthey are words which do justice to the subject and to the speaker. But\r\nmore than two years have passed since the representations were made to\r\nthe right hon. gentleman the Member for St. George's, Hanover Square,\r\nwhich induced him to confer a measure of self-government on the\r\nTransvaal. Those representations laid stress on the fact that the\r\ndesire for self-government was not put forward only by the Boers, but\r\nthat both sections of the community in the Transvaal desired to take\r\nthe control of affairs into their own hands. The right hon. gentleman\r\npublished a Constitution. That Constitution conferred very great and\r\nwide powers. It conferred upon an overwhelming elected majority the\r\nabsolute power of the purse and control over legislation. But it has\r\nalways been my submission to the House that that Constitution had about\r\nit no element of permanence, that it could not possibly have been\r\nmaintained as an enduring, or even a workable settlement; and I am\r\nbound to say--I do not wish to be controversial this afternoon if I can\r\navoid it--that, when I read the statement that this representative\r\ngovernment stage would have been a convenient educative stage in the\r\ntransition to full self-government, the whole experience of British\r\ncolonial policy does not justify such an assumption. The system of\r\nrepresentative government without responsible Ministers, without\r\nresponsible powers, has led to endless friction and inconvenience\r\nwherever and whenever it has been employed. It has failed in Canada, it\r\nhas failed in Natal and Cape Colony. It has been condemned by almost\r\nevery high colonial authority who has studied this question. I do not\r\nthink I need quote any more conclusive authority upon that subject than\r\nthat of Lord Durham. Lord Durham, in his celebrated Report, says of\r\nthis particular system:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to understand how any English statesmen could have\r\nimagined that representative and irresponsible government could be\r\nsuccessfully combined. There seems, indeed, to be an idea that the\r\ncharacter of representative institutions ought to be thus modified in\r\nColonies; that it is an incident of colonial dependence that the\r\nofficers of government should be nominated by the Crown without any\r\nreference to the wishes of the community whose interests are entrusted\r\nto their keeping. It has never been very clearly explained what are\r\nthe Imperial interests which require this complete nullification of\r\nrepresentative government. But if there is such a necessity it is\r\nquite clear that a representative Government in a Colony must be a\r\nmockery and a source of confusion, for those who support this system\r\nhave never yet been able to devise or exhibit in the practical working\r\nof colonial government any means for making so complete an abrogation\r\nof political influence palatable to the representative body.\"\r\n\r\nI contend that the right hon. gentleman's Constitution would have\r\nbroken down in its first session, and that we should have then been\r\nforced to concede grudgingly and in a hurry the full measure of\r\nresponsible government which, with all due formality, and without any\r\nprecipitancy, the Letters Patent issued last week have now conferred.\r\nBut even the right hon. gentleman himself did not intend his\r\nConstitution to be a permanent settlement. He intended it to be a\r\ntransition, and a brief transition; and in the correspondence which\r\npassed on this subject two or three years is sometimes named as the\r\nperiod for which such a Constitution might conveniently have\r\nendured--two or three years, of which, let me point out to the House,\r\nnearly two years have already gone. Seeing how little difference there\r\nis between us upon that question, I dispense with further argument as\r\nto the grant of a Transvaal Constitution, as I see the course we have\r\nadopted does commend itself to the good sense of all Parties in this\r\ncountry and is sustained at almost every point by almost every person\r\nconversant with South African affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, we have heard it often said, \"It may be wise to\r\ngrant responsible government to the Transvaal, but it is not wise to\r\ngive it to the Orange River Colony. Why should you give it to the\r\nOrange River Colony too?\" I say, \"Why not?\" Let us make it quite clear\r\nthat the burden of proof always rests with those who deny or restrict\r\nthe issue of full Parliamentary liberties. They have to make their case\r\ngood from month to month, and from day to day. What are the reasons\r\nwhich have been advanced against the issue of a Constitution to the\r\nOrange River Colony? Various reasons have been put forward. We have\r\nbeen told, first, that the Colony is not ripe for self-government. When\r\nyou have very small communities of white men in distant and immense\r\nterritories, and when those communities are emerging from a wild into a\r\nmore settled condition, then it is very necessary and very desirable\r\nthat the growth of self-governing institutions should be gradual. But\r\nthat is not the situation in the Orange River Colony. The Orange Free\r\nState was the model small republic of the world. The honourable\r\ntraditions of the Free State are not challenged by any who take the\r\ntrouble to study its history, either in the distant past, or in the\r\nyears immediately preceding the South African war. The right hon.\r\ngentleman the Member for West Birmingham himself, speaking in this\r\nHouse on December 7, 1900, used language which, I think, should go far\r\nto dissipate the idle fears which we hear expressed in various quarters\r\nupon the grant of self-government to the Orange River Colony:\r\n\r\n\"We do not propose,\" said the right hon. gentleman, \"that the\r\nConstitution of the Orange River Colony should necessarily be the same\r\nas the Constitution of the Transvaal Colony, either at starting or in\r\nthe immediate future. It will be dealt with upon its own merits, dealt\r\nwith separately, and we think it possible\"--I ask the House to mark\r\nthis--\"from the circumstances with which every one is familiar, that\r\nan earlier beginning to greater political liberty may be made in the\r\nOrange River Colony than in the Transvaal. That is due to the fact\r\nthat the Government of the Orange River Colony previous to the war was\r\nby common consent a very good Government, and consequently, speaking\r\ngenerally, of course, and not of individuals, we shall find there\r\nprobably the means to creating a satisfactory administration more\r\nquickly than we can do in the case of the Transvaal Colony.\"\r\n\r\nThen we have been told that responsible government presupposes Party\r\ngovernment, and that in the Orange River Colony there are not the\r\nelements of political parties, that there is not that diversity of\r\ninterests which we see in the Transvaal, that there are not the same\r\nsharp differences between town and country, or the same astonishing\r\ncontrasts between wealth and poverty which prevail in the Transvaal.\r\nAnd we are told that, in order that responsible government should work\r\nproperly, and Party government should be a success, there must be the\r\nessential elements of Party conflict. I suppose we are, as a majority\r\nin this House, admirers of the Party system of government; but I do\r\nnot think that we should any of us carry our admiration of that system\r\nso far as to say that the nation is unfit to enjoy the privilege of\r\nmanaging its own affairs unless it can find some one to quarrel with\r\nand plenty of things to quarrel about.\r\n\r\nThen we are told that--\"The country is prospering as it is. Why change\r\nnow? The land is tranquil, people are regaining the prosperity which\r\nwas lost in the war. It is a pity to make a change now; now is not the\r\nmoment.\" I admit the premise, but I draw exactly the opposite\r\nconclusion. It is just for that reason that we should now step forward\r\nand, taking occasion by the hand, make an advance in the system of\r\ngovernment. How often in the history of nations has the golden\r\nopportunity been allowed to slip away! How often have rulers and\r\nGovernments been forced to make in foul weather the very journey which\r\nthey have refused to make prosperously in fair weather!\r\n\r\nThen we are told that Imperial interests will be endangered by this\r\ngrant. I do not believe that that is so. The Boer mind moves by\r\ndefinite steps from one political conception to another. I believe\r\nthey have definitely abandoned their old ambition of creating in South\r\nAfrica a United States independent of the British Crown, and have\r\naccepted that other political ideal which is represented by the\r\nDominion of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia. At any rate, no\r\npeople have a greater right to claim respect on the ground of their\r\nloyal adherence to treaty engagements than the people of the Orange\r\nRiver Colony; for every one knows that it was with a most faithful\r\nadherence to their engagements, with almost Quixotic loyalty, that\r\nthey followed--many of them knowing where their fortune was going to\r\nlead them, knowing full well what would be the result of their\r\naction--their sister State into the disastrous struggle of the South\r\nAfrican war.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that there is in existence at the present time--and I\r\nthink Lord Milner has pointed it out--no bond of love between the men\r\nwho fought us in that war and this country. I was reading the other\r\nday a speech by Mr. Steyn. Mr. Steyn is, of course, one of the most\r\nclearly avowed opponents of the British power. But Mr. Steyn is quite\r\nclear upon this point. He says there is no bond of love, and it would\r\nbe untruthful and dishonest on their part to say that such a bond\r\nexisted. But, he says, there is another bond; there is such a thing as\r\na man's word of honour. \"We gave our word of honour at Vereeniging,\r\nand it is our intention to abide strictly by that.\" I state my opinion\r\nas to the safety of the step we propose to take, but I cannot expect\r\nthe Members opposite to set much store by that, although it is an\r\nhonest and sincere opinion. But I will quote them an authority which I\r\nam sure they will not dismiss without respect. As soon as the right\r\nhon. Member for West Birmingham returned from South Africa, while his\r\nexperiences in that country were fresh in his mind, while he had but\r\nnewly been conversing with men of all parties there on the spot, the\r\nscene of the struggle, he made a speech in this House which really\r\nought not to be overlooked by persons dealing with this question.\r\n\r\n\"Great importance,\" said the right hon. gentleman, \"seems to be\r\nattached to the view that in the interests of the two Colonies it is\r\ndesirable that a certain time, not a long time in the history of a\r\nnation, but still a certain time should elapse before full\r\nself-government is accorded. Whether a long time will elapse I really\r\ncannot say. One thing is clear: if the population of the Transvaal and\r\nOrange River Colony, both Boer and Briton, by a large majority,\r\ndesire this self-government, even although it might seem to us to be\r\npremature, I should think it unwise to refuse it. I do not myself\r\nbelieve there is any such danger connected with Imperial interests\r\nthat we should hesitate to accord it on that ground. The ground on\r\nwhich I should desire that it might be delayed is really the interest\r\nof the two Colonies themselves, and not any Imperial interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe peace and order of the Orange River Colony establish this case on\r\nits merits. It is a State bound to moderation by the circumstance of\r\nits geographical position. In all its history in South Africa it has\r\nbeen largely dependent on the goodwill of its neighbours--goodwill and\r\nfriendly relations maintained with Natal and the Transvaal, on the one\r\nhand, and with the Cape Colony on the other. It is inconceivable that\r\na State so situated in regard to its railways and its economic\r\nposition generally should be a disturbing influence from the point of\r\nview of the different States of South Africa. But there is another\r\nfact which justifies this grant, and that is the extraordinary\r\ncrimelessness in a political sense of the whole of that country. Let\r\nthe House remember that there had been three years' war, of which two\r\nyears were fierce guerilla fighting, and that on all sides there were\r\nto be found desperate men who had been for a long period holding their\r\nlives in their hands and engaged on every wild and adventurous foray.\r\nPeace is agreed on, and what happens? Absolute order exists and\r\nprevails throughout the whole country from that moment. There has not\r\nbeen a single case of violent crime except, I believe, one murder\r\ncommitted by a lunatic--hardly a case of sedition--and not a single\r\ncase of prosecution for treason of any kind. I say without hesitation\r\nthat in order to find a similar instance of swift transition from\r\nviolent warfare to law-abiding peace you have got to look back to the\r\ndays when the army of the Parliament was reviewed and disbanded at the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nI submit to the House that a case for conferring responsible\r\ngovernment on the Orange River Colony is established on its merits.\r\nBut that is not the whole question before us this afternoon. We have\r\nnot merely to decide whether we will give a Constitution to the Orange\r\nRiver Colony, but whether, having given a Constitution to the\r\nTransvaal, we will deliberately withhold one from the Orange River\r\nColony; and that is an argument which multiplies the others which I\r\nhave used. On what ground could we refuse that equal treatment of the\r\nOrange River Colony? There is only one ground which we could assign\r\nfor such a refusal, and that is that in the Orange River Colony there\r\nis sure to be a Dutch majority. I cannot conceive any more fatal\r\nassertion that could be made on the part of the Imperial Government\r\nthan that on this specific racial ground they were forced to refuse\r\nliberties which otherwise they would concede. I say such a refusal\r\nwould be an insult to the hundreds and thousands of loyal Dutch\r\nsubjects the King has in all parts of South Africa, I say that this\r\ninvidious treatment of the Orange River Colony would be the greatest\r\nblunder, a fitting pendant to all that long concatenation of fatal\r\nmistakes which has marked our policy in South Africa for so many\r\nyears; and I say it would be a breach of the spirit of the terms of\r\npeace, because we could not say, \"We promised you self-government by\r\nthe terms of peace, but what we meant by that was that before you were\r\nto have self-government, enough persons of British origin should have\r\narrived in the country to make quite sure you would be out-voted.\"\r\n\r\nIf we were to adopt such a course we should be false to that\r\nagreement, which is the great foundation of our policy in South\r\nAfrica. I hope the House will earnestly sustain the importance of that\r\nVereeniging agreement. For the first time in many years the two white\r\nraces dwelling together in South Africa have found a common foundation\r\non which they can both build, a foundation much better than\r\nBoomplaats, or the Sand River Convention, or the Conventions of 1880\r\nand 1884, far better than Majuba Hill or the Jameson Raid. They have\r\nfound a foundation which they can both look to without any feeling of\r\nshame--on the contrary, with feelings of equal honour, and I trust\r\nalso with feelings of mutual forgiveness.\r\n\r\nOn those grounds, therefore, we have decided to give to the Orange\r\nRiver Colony full responsible government. We eschew altogether the\r\nidea of treating them differently from the Transvaal, or interposing\r\nany state of limited self-government between them and the full\r\nenjoyment of their right. There is to be a Legislature which will\r\nconsist of two Chambers, as in the Transvaal. The First Chamber will\r\nbe elected upon a voters' basis and by manhood suffrage. The\r\nresidential qualification will be the same as in the Transvaal, six\r\nmonths. The distribution of seats has been settled by general consent.\r\nThe Committee which we sent to South Africa, and which was so very\r\nsuccessful in arriving at an adjustment between the parties in the\r\nTransvaal, has made similar investigations in the Orange River Colony,\r\nand I think we may accept with confidence their recommendation. They\r\nrecommend that the number of members should be thirty-eight. The old\r\nVolksraad had sixty members, but it was found to be much too large for\r\nthe needs of the country, and on several occasions efforts were made\r\nto reduce the representation. Those efforts were not successful, from\r\nthe fact, which we can all appreciate, that it is very difficult\r\nindeed to get a representative body to pass a self-denying ordinance\r\nof that character which involves the extinction of its own members.\r\nThere will be separate representation of towns in the Orange River\r\nColony. In the Volksraad there was such a representation: there were\r\nforty-two rural members and eighteen urban members. Out of the\r\nthirty-eight we propose that there shall be twenty-seven rural\r\nmembers and eleven urban members; rather less than a third of the\r\nrepresentation will be that of the small towns. That is a proportion\r\nwhich is justified by the precedent of the old Constitution, and also\r\nby the latest census.\r\n\r\nThere will be a Second Chamber, and, as in the Transvaal, it will be\r\nnominated, for the first Parliament only, by the Governor, under\r\ninstructions from the Secretary of State. It is not an hereditary\r\nChamber; and it may be, therefore, assumed that the distribution of\r\nParties in that Chamber will be attended by some measure of\r\nimpartiality, and that there will be some general attempt to select\r\nonly those persons who are really fit to exercise the important\r\nfunctions entrusted to them. But even so protected, the Government\r\nfeel that in the ultimate issue in a conflict between the two\r\nChambers, the first and representative Chamber must prevail. The other\r\nbody may review and may suspend, but for the case of measures sent up\r\nin successive sessions from the representative Chamber on which no\r\nagreement can be reached, we have introduced the machinery which\r\nappears in the Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, that both\r\nChambers shall sit together, debate together, vote together, and the\r\nmajority shall decide. The whole success of that operation depends\r\nupon the numerical proportion observed between the two Chambers. In\r\nthe Australian Commonwealth the proportion of the First Chamber is\r\nrather more than two to one; in the Transvaal the proportion will be\r\nmore than four to one, namely, sixty-five to fifteen; and in the\r\nOrange River Colony it will be thirty-eight to eleven.\r\n\r\nThe other provisions of the Constitution will mainly follow the lines\r\nof the Transvaal Constitution. The Constitution of the Orange River\r\nColony will become effective as soon as possible; and I should think\r\nthat the new Parliament might assemble in Bloemfontein some time\r\nduring the autumn of next year. When that work has been completed, and\r\nthe new Parliament has assembled, the main direction of South African\r\naffairs in these Colonies will have passed from our hands.\r\n\r\nSir, it is the earnest desire of the Government to steer colonial\r\naffairs out of English Party politics, not only in the interest of the\r\nproper conduct of those affairs, but in order to clear the arena at\r\nhome for the introduction of measures which affect the masses of the\r\npeople. We have tried in South Africa to deal fairly between man and\r\nman, to adjust conflicting interests and overlapping claims. We have\r\ntried so far as possible to effect a broad-bottomed settlement of the\r\nquestion which should command the assent of people even beyond the\r\ngreat party groupings which support us.\r\n\r\nOther liberties besides their own will be enshrined in these new\r\nParliaments. The people of South Africa, and, in a special measure,\r\nthe Boers, will become the trustees of freedom all over the world. We\r\nhave tried to act with fairness and good feeling. If by any chance our\r\ncounsels of reconciliation should come to nothing, if our policy\r\nshould end in mocking disaster, then the resulting evil would not be\r\nconfined to South Africa. Our unfortunate experience would be\r\ntrumpeted forth all over the world wherever despotism wanted a good\r\nargument for bayonets, whenever an arbitrary Government wished to deny\r\nor curtail the liberties of imprisoned nationalities. But if, on the\r\nother hand, as we hope and profoundly believe, better days are in\r\nstore for South Africa, if the words of President Brand, \"All shall\r\ncome right,\" are at length to be fulfilled, and if the near future\r\nshould unfold to our eves a tranquil, prosperous, consolidated\r\nAfrikander nation under the protecting aegis of the British Crown,\r\nthen, the good also will not be confined to South Africa; then the\r\ncause of the poor and the weak all over the world will have been\r\nsustained; and everywhere small peoples will get more room to breathe,\r\nand everywhere great empires will be encouraged by our example to step\r\nforward--and it only needs a step--into the sunshine of a more gentle\r\nand a more generous age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERALISM AND SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nST. ANDREW'S HALL, GLASGOW, _October 11, 1906_\r\n\r\n(From _The Dundee Advertiser_, by permission.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first indispensable condition of democratic progress must be the\r\nmaintenance of European peace. War is fatal to Liberalism. Liberalism\r\nis the world-wide antagonist of war. We have every reason to\r\ncongratulate ourselves upon the general aspect of the European\r\nsituation. The friendship which has grown up between Great Britain and\r\nFrance is a source of profound satisfaction to every serious and\r\nthinking man. The first duty of a nation is to make friends with its\r\nnearest neighbour. Six years ago France was agitated in the throes of\r\nthe Dreyfus case, and Great Britain was plunged in the worst and most\r\npainful period of the South African war; and both nations--conscious\r\nas we are of one another's infirmities--were inclined to express their\r\nopinion about the conduct of the other in unmeasured terms, and keen\r\nantagonism resulted. What a contrast to-day! Ever since the King,\r\nwhose services in the cause of international peace are regarded with\r\naffection in every quarter of his dominions, ever since by an act of\r\nprescience and of courage his Majesty went to Paris, the relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and France have steadily and progressively\r\nimproved, and to-day we witness the inspiring spectacle of these two\r\ngreat peoples, the two most genuinely Liberal nations in the whole\r\nworld, locked together in a league of friendship under standards of\r\ndispassionate justice and international goodwill. But it is absurd to\r\nsuppose that the friendship which we have established with France\r\nshould be in any degree a menace to any other European Power, or to\r\nthe great Power of Germany.\r\n\r\nIf the prospects on the European continent are bright and tranquil, I\r\nthink we have reason to feel also contentment at the course of\r\nColonial affairs. We have had unusual difficulties in the Colonies;\r\nbut in spite of every effort to excite Colonial apprehension for Party\r\npurposes against a Liberal Ministry through the instrumentality of a\r\npowerful press, the great States of the Empire have felt, and with\r\nmore assurance every day, that a Liberal Administration in Downing\r\nStreet will respect their rights and cherish their interests.\r\n\r\nBut I am drawn to South Africa by the memory that to-night, the 11th\r\nof October, is the anniversary of the declaration of war; and I think\r\nit is in South Africa that we have especial reason to be satisfied\r\nwith the course which events have taken, since we have been in any\r\ndegree responsible for their direction. One great advantage we have\r\nhad--a good foundation to build on. We have had the Treaty of\r\nVereeniging, by which peace was established between the Dutch and\r\nBritish races in South Africa upon terms honourable to both. We have\r\nhad that treaty as our foundation--and what a mercy it is, looking\r\nback on the past, to think that the nation followed Lord Rosebery's\r\nadvice at Chesterfield to terminate the war by a regular peace and a\r\nregular settlement, and were not lured away, as Lord Milner would have\r\nadvised them, when he said that the war in a certain sense would never\r\nbe over, into a harsh policy of unconditional surrender and pitiless\r\nsubjugation.\r\n\r\nThe work of giving these free Constitutions to the two Colonies in\r\nSouth Africa, so lately independent Republics, is in harmony with the\r\nmost sagacious instincts, and the most honoured traditions of the\r\nLiberal Party. But I notice that Lord Milner, who, as we remember, was\r\nonce a Liberal candidate,--and who now appears before us sometimes in\r\nthe guise of a silent and suffering public servant, sometimes in the\r\naspect of an active, and even an acrid, political partisan, haranguing\r\nhis supporters and attacking his Majesty's Ministers,--Lord Milner\r\ndescribes all this improving outlook as \"the dreary days of reaction.\"\r\nProgress and reaction are no doubt relative terms. What one man calls\r\nprogress another will call reaction. If you have been rapidly\r\ndescending the road to ruin and you suddenly check yourself, stop,\r\nturn back, and retrace your steps, that is reaction, and no doubt your\r\nformer guide will have every reason to reproach you with\r\ninconsistency. And it seems to me not at all unnatural that to one who\r\nregards three years' desolating civil war as a period of healthy and\r\ninspiring progress, a good deal of what his Majesty's Government have\r\nlately done in South Africa must appear very dreary and reactionary\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nBut I would recommend you to leave this disconsolate proconsul alone.\r\nI do not agree with him when he says that South Africa is passing\r\nthrough a time of trial. South Africa is emerging from her time of\r\ntrial. The darkest period is behind her. Brighter prospects lie before\r\nher. The improvement upon which we are counting is not the hectic\r\nflush of a market boom, but the steady revival and accumulation of\r\nagricultural and industrial productiveness. Soberly and solemnly men\r\nof all parties and of both races in South Africa are joining together\r\nto revive and to develop the prosperity of their own country. Grave\r\ndifficulties, many dangers, long exertions lie before them; but the\r\nstar of South Africa is already in the ascendant, and I look\r\nconfidently forward to the time when it will take its place, united,\r\nfederated, free, beside Canada and Australia, in the shining\r\nconstellation of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen we have dealt with subjects which lie outside our own island, let\r\nus concentrate our attention on what lies within it, because the\r\ngravest problems lie at home. I shall venture to-night to make a few\r\ngeneral observations upon those larger trendings of events which\r\ngovern the incidents and the accidents of the hour. The fortunes and\r\nthe interests of Liberalism and Labour are inseparably interwoven;\r\nthey rise by the same forces, and in spite of similar obstacles, they\r\nface the same enemies, they are affected by the same dangers, and the\r\nhistory of the last thirty years shows quite clearly that their power\r\nof influencing public affairs and of commanding national attention\r\nfluctuate together. Together they are elevated, together they are\r\ndepressed, and any Tory reaction which swept the Liberal Party out of\r\npower would assuredly work at least proportionate havoc in the ranks\r\nof Labour. That may not be a very palatable truth, but it is a truth\r\nnone the less.\r\n\r\nLabour! It is a great word. It moves the world, it comprises the\r\nmillions, it combines many men in many lands in the sympathy of a\r\ncommon burden. Who has the right to speak for Labour? A good many\r\npeople arrogate to themselves the right to speak for Labour. How many\r\npolitical Flibbertigibbets are there not running up and down the land\r\ncalling themselves the people of Great Britain, and the social\r\ndemocracy, and the masses of the nation! But I am inclined to think,\r\nso far as any body of organised opinion can claim the right to speak\r\nfor this immense portion of the human race, it is the trade unions\r\nthat more than any other organisation must be considered the\r\nresponsible and deputed representatives of Labour. They are the most\r\nhighly organised part of Labour; they are the most responsible part;\r\nthey are from day to day in contact with reality. They are not mere\r\nvisionaries or dreamers weaving airy Utopias out of tobacco smoke.\r\nThey are not political adventurers who are eager to remodel the world\r\nby rule-of-thumb, who are proposing to make the infinite complexities\r\nof scientific civilisation and the multitudinous phenomena of great\r\ncities conform to a few barbarous formulas which any moderately\r\nintelligent parrot could repeat in a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the trade unions are interwoven with the industries\r\nthey serve. The more highly organised trade unions are, the more\r\nclearly they recognise their responsibilities; the larger their\r\nmembership, the greater their knowledge, the wider their outlook. Of\r\ncourse, trade unions will make mistakes, like everybody else, will do\r\nfoolish things, and wrong things, and want more than they are likely\r\nto get, just like everybody else. But the fact remains that for thirty\r\nyears trade unions have had a charter from Parliament which up to\r\nwithin a few years ago protected their funds, and gave them effective\r\npower to conduct a strike; and no one can say that these thirty years\r\nwere bad years of British industry, that during these thirty years it\r\nwas impossible to develop great businesses and carry on large\r\nmanufacturing operations, because, as everybody knows perfectly well,\r\nthose were good and expanding years of British trade and national\r\nenrichment.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a series of judicial decisions utterly changed the\r\nwhole character of the law regarding trade unions. It became difficult\r\nand obscure. The most skilful lawyers were unable to define it. No\r\ncounsel knew what advice to tender to those who sought his guidance.\r\nMeanwhile if, in the conduct of a strike, any act of an agent, however\r\nunauthorised, transgressed the shadowy and uncertain border-line\r\nbetween what was legal and what was not, an action for damages might\r\nbe instituted against the trade union, and if the action was\r\nsuccessful, trade union funds, accumulated penny by penny, year by\r\nyear, with which were inseparably intermingled friendly and benefit\r\nmoneys, might in a moment have been swept away. That was the state of\r\nthe law when his Majesty's present advisers were returned to power.\r\nWe have determined to give back that charter to the trade unions. The\r\nBill is even now passing through the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWe are often told that there can be no progress for democracy until\r\nthe Liberal Party has been destroyed. Let us examine that. Labour in\r\nthis country exercises a great influence upon the Government. That is\r\nnot so everywhere. It is not so, for instance, in Germany, and yet in\r\nGermany there is no Liberal Party worth speaking of. Labour there is\r\nvery highly organised, and the Liberal Party there has been destroyed.\r\nIn Germany there exists exactly the condition of affairs, in a Party\r\nsense, that Mr. Keir Hardie and his friends are so anxious to\r\nintroduce here. A great social democratic party on the one hand, are\r\nbluntly and squarely face to face with a capitalist and military\r\nconfederation on the other. That is the issue, as it presents itself\r\nin Germany; that is the issue, as I devoutly hope it may never present\r\nitself here. And what is the result? In spite of the great numbers of\r\nthe Socialist Party in Germany, in spite of the high ability of its\r\nleaders, it has hardly any influence whatever upon the course of\r\npublic affairs. It has to submit to food taxes and to conscription;\r\nand I observe that Herr Bebel, the distinguished leader of that Party,\r\nat Mannheim the other day was forced to admit, and admitted with great\r\ncandour, that there was no other country in Europe so effectively\r\norganised as Germany to put down anything in the nature of a violent\r\nSocialist movement. That is rather a disquieting result to working men\r\nof having destroyed the Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nBut we are told to wait a bit; the Socialist Party in Germany is only\r\nthree millions. How many will there be in ten years' time? That is a\r\nfair argument. I should like to say this. A great many men can jump\r\nfour feet, but very few can jump six feet. After a certain distance\r\nthe difficulty increases progressively. It is so with the horse-power\r\nrequired to drive great ships across the ocean; it is so with the\r\nlifting power required to raise balloons in the air. A balloon goes up\r\nquite easily for a certain distance, but after a certain distance it\r\nrefuses to go up any farther, because the air is too rarefied to float\r\nit and sustain it. And, therefore, I would say let us examine the\r\nconcrete facts.\r\n\r\nIn France, before the Revolution, property was divided among a very\r\nfew people. A few thousand nobles and priests and merchants had all\r\nthe wealth in the country; twenty-five million peasants had nothing.\r\nBut in modern States, such as we see around us in the world to-day,\r\nproperty is very widely divided. I do not say it is evenly divided. I\r\ndo not say it is fairly divided, but it is very widely divided.\r\nEspecially is that true in Great Britain. Nowhere else in the world,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in France and the United States, are there such vast\r\nnumbers of persons who are holders of interest-bearing,\r\nprofit-bearing, rent-earning property, and the whole tendency of\r\ncivilisation and of free institutions is to an ever-increasing volume\r\nof production and an increasingly wide diffusion of profit. And\r\ntherein lies the essential stability of modern States. There are\r\nmillions of persons who would certainly lose by anything like a\r\ngeneral overturn, and they are everywhere the strongest and best\r\norganised millions. And I have no hesitation in saying that any\r\nviolent movement would infallibly encounter an overwhelming\r\nresistance, and that any movement which was inspired by mere class\r\nprejudice, or by a desire to gain a selfish advantage, would encounter\r\nfrom the selfish power of the \"haves\" an effective resistance which\r\nwould bring it to sterility and to destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the conclusion to which I lead you. Something more is\r\nneeded if we are to get forward. There lies the function of the\r\nLiberal Party. Liberalism supplies at once the higher impulse and the\r\npracticable path; it appeals to persons by sentiments of generosity\r\nand humanity; it proceeds by courses of moderation. By gradual steps,\r\nby steady effort from day to day, from year to year, Liberalism\r\nenlists hundreds of thousands upon the side of progress and popular\r\ndemocratic reform whom militant Socialism would drive into violent\r\nTory reaction. That is why the Tory Party hate us. That is why they,\r\ntoo, direct their attacks upon the great organisation of the Liberal\r\nParty, because they know it is through the agency of Liberalism that\r\nsociety will be able in the course of time to slide forward, almost\r\npainlessly--for the world is changing very fast--on to a more even and\r\na more equal foundation. That is the mission that lies before\r\nLiberalism. The cause of the Liberal Party is the cause of the\r\nleft-out millions; and because we believe that there is in all the\r\nworld no other instrument of equal potency and efficacy available at\r\nthe present time for the purposes of social amelioration, we are bound\r\nin duty and in honour to guard it from all attacks, whether they arise\r\nfrom violence or from reaction.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to-night to plunge into a discussion of the\r\nphilosophical divergencies between Socialism and Liberalism. It is not\r\npossible to draw a hard-and-fast line between individualism and\r\ncollectivism. You cannot draw it either in theory or in practice. That\r\nis where the Socialist makes a mistake. Let us not imitate that\r\nmistake. No man can be a collectivist alone or an individualist alone.\r\nHe must be both an individualist and a collectivist. The nature of man\r\nis a dual nature. The character of the organisation of human society\r\nis dual. Man is at once a unique being and a gregarious animal. For\r\nsome purposes he must be collectivist, for others he is, and he will\r\nfor all time remain, an individualist. Collectively we have an Army\r\nand a Navy and a Civil Service; collectively we have a Post Office,\r\nand a police, and a Government; collectively we light our streets and\r\nsupply ourselves with water; collectively we indulge increasingly in\r\nall the necessities of communication. But we do not make love\r\ncollectively, and the ladies do not marry us collectively, and we do\r\nnot eat collectively, and we do not die collectively, and it is not\r\ncollectively that we face the sorrows and the hopes, the winnings and\r\nthe losings of this world of accident and storm.\r\n\r\nNo view of society can possibly be complete which does not comprise\r\nwithin its scope both collective organisation and individual\r\nincentive. The whole tendency of civilisation is, however, towards the\r\nmultiplication of the collective functions of society. The\r\never-growing complications of civilisation create for us new services\r\nwhich have to be undertaken by the State, and create for us an\r\nexpansion of the existing services. There is a growing feeling, which\r\nI entirely share, against allowing those services which are in the\r\nnature of monopolies to pass into private hands. There is a pretty\r\nsteady determination, which I am convinced will become effective in\r\nthe present Parliament, to intercept all future unearned increment\r\nwhich may arise from the increase in the speculative value of the\r\nland. There will be an ever-widening area of municipal enterprise. I\r\ngo farther; I should like to see the State embark on various novel\r\nand adventurous experiments, I am delighted to see that Mr. Burns is\r\nnow interesting himself in afforestation. I am of opinion that the\r\nState should increasingly assume the position of the reserve employer\r\nof labour. I am very sorry we have not got the railways of this\r\ncountry in our hands. We may do something better with the canals, and\r\nwe are all agreed, every one in this hall who belongs to the\r\nProgressive Party, that the State must increasingly and earnestly\r\nconcern itself with the care of the sick and the aged, and, above all,\r\nof the children.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the universal establishment of minimum standards of\r\nlife and labour, and their progressive elevation as the increasing\r\nenergies of production may permit. I do not think that Liberalism in\r\nany circumstances can cut itself off from this fertile field of social\r\neffort, and I would recommend you not to be scared in discussing any\r\nof these proposals, just because some old woman comes along and tells\r\nyou they are Socialistic. If you take my advice, you will judge each\r\ncase on its merits. Where you find that State enterprise is likely to\r\nbe ineffective, then utilise private enterprises, and do not grudge\r\nthem their profits.\r\n\r\nThe existing organisation of society is driven by one\r\nmainspring--competitive selection. It may be a very imperfect\r\norganisation of society, but it is all we have got between us and\r\nbarbarism. It is all we have been able to create through unnumbered\r\ncenturies of effort and sacrifice. It is the whole treasure which past\r\ngenerations have been able to secure, and which they have been able to\r\nbequeath; and great and numerous as are the evils of the existing\r\ncondition of society in this country, the advantages and achievements\r\nof the social system are greater still. Moreover, that system is one\r\nwhich offers an almost indefinite capacity for improvement. We may\r\nprogressively eliminate the evils; we may progressively augment the\r\ngoods which it contains. I do not want to see impaired the vigour of\r\ncompetition, but we can do much to mitigate the consequences of\r\nfailure. We want to draw a line below which we will not allow persons\r\nto live and labour, yet above which they may compete with all the\r\nstrength of their manhood. We want to have free competition upwards;\r\nwe decline to allow free competition to run downwards. We do not want\r\nto pull down the structures of science and civilisation: but to\r\nspread a net over the abyss; and I am sure that if the vision of a\r\nfair Utopia which cheers the hearts and lights the imagination of the\r\ntoiling multitudes, should ever break into reality, it will be by\r\ndevelopments through, and modifications in, and by improvements out\r\nof, the existing competitive organisation of society; and I believe\r\nthat Liberalism mobilised, and active as it is to-day, will be a\r\nprincipal and indispensable factor in that noble evolution.\r\n\r\nI have been for nearly six years, in rather a short life, trained as a\r\nsoldier, and I will use a military metaphor. There is no operation in\r\nwar more dangerous or more important than the conduct of a rear-guard\r\naction and the extrication of a rear-guard from difficult and broken\r\nground. In the long war which humanity wages with the elements of\r\nnature the main body of the army has won its victory. It has moved out\r\ninto the open plain, into a pleasant camping ground by the water\r\nsprings and in the sunshine, amid fair cities and fertile fields. But\r\nthe rear-guard is entangled in the defiles, the rear-guard is still\r\nstruggling in mountainous country, attacked and assailed on every side\r\nby the onslaughts of a pitiless enemy. The rear-guard is encumbered\r\nwith wounded, obstructed by all the broken vehicles that have fallen\r\nback from the main line of the march, with all the stragglers and\r\nweaklings that have fallen by the way and can struggle forward no\r\nfarther. It is to the rear-guard of the army that attention should be\r\ndirected. There is the place for the bravest soldiers and the most\r\ntrusted generals. It is there that all the resources of military\r\nscience and its heaviest artillery should be employed to extricate the\r\nrear-guard--not to bring the main army back from good positions which\r\nit occupies, not to throw away the victory which it has won over the\r\nbrute forces of nature--but to bring the rear-guard in, to bring them\r\ninto the level plain, so that they too may dwell in a land of peace\r\nand plenty.\r\n\r\nThat is the aim of the Liberal Party, and if we work together we will\r\ndo something for its definite accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL PREFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL CONFERENCE,[2] DOWNING STREET, _May 7, 1907_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic aspect of Imperial Preference, both from the point of\r\nview of trade and of finance, has already been dealt with very fully\r\nby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of\r\nTrade, and I desire in the few observations with which I shall venture\r\nto trespass upon the indulgence of the Conference to refer very\r\nlittle to the economic aspect, and rather to examine one or two points\r\nabout this question of a political, of a Parliamentary, and almost of\r\na diplomatic character. I want to consider for a moment what would be\r\nthe effect of a system of preferences upon the course of Parliamentary\r\nbusiness. The course of Colonial affairs in the House of Commons is\r\nnot always very smooth or very simple, and I am bound to say that,\r\nhaving for eighteen months been responsible for the statements on\r\nbehalf of this Department which are made to the House of Commons, I\r\nfeel that enormous difficulties would be added to the discharge of\r\nColonial business in the House of Commons, if we were to involve\r\nourselves in a system of reciprocal preferences. Every one will agree,\r\nfrom whatever part of the King's dominions he comes, or to whatever\r\nParty he belongs, that Colonial affairs suffer very much when brought\r\ninto the arena of British Party politics. Sometimes it is one Party\r\nand sometimes it is another which is constrained to interfere in the\r\ncourse of purely Colonial affairs, and such interferences are nearly\r\nalways fraught with vexation and inconvenience to the Dominions\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nNow, the system of Imperial preference inevitably brings Colonial\r\naffairs into the Parliamentary and the Party arena; and, if I may say\r\nso, it brings them into the most unpleasant part of Parliamentary and\r\npolitical work--that part which is concerned with raising the taxation\r\nfor each year. It is very easy to talk about preference in the\r\nabstract and in general terms, and very many pleasant things can be\r\nsaid about mutual profits and the good feeling which accrues from\r\ncommercial intercourse. But in regard to preference, as in regard to\r\nall other tariff questions, the discussion cannot possibly be\r\npractical, unless the propositions are formulated in precise, exact,\r\nand substantial detail. Many people will avow themselves in favour of\r\nthe principle of preference who would recoil when the schedule of\r\ntaxes was presented to their inspection.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, leave generalities about preference on one side. I leave\r\nalso proposals which have been discussed that we should give a\r\npreference on existing duties. It is quite clear that no preference\r\ngiven upon existing duties could possibly be complete or satisfactory.\r\nIt could at the very best only be a beginning, and Dr. Jameson and Dr.\r\nSmartt, when they urged us with so much force to make a beginning by\r\ngiving a preference on South African tobacco, have clearly recognised\r\nand frankly stated, that that preference would in itself be of small\r\nvalue, but that it would be welcomed by them as conceding \"the larger\r\nprinciple.\" Therefore, we are entitled to say, that before us at this\r\nConference is not any question of making a small or tentative\r\nbeginning on this or that particular duty, but we have to make up our\r\nminds upon the general principle of the application of a reciprocal\r\npreference to the trade relations of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nIf that be so, surely the representatives of the self-governing\r\nDominions who ask us to embark on such a system, ought to state\r\nsquarely and abruptly the duties which in their opinion would be\r\nnecessary to give effect to such a proposal. The question whether raw\r\nmaterial is to be taxed is absolutely vital to any consideration of\r\nImperial preference. Although it is no doubt a very good answer, when\r\nthe direct question is raised,--What are your notions? to say that the\r\nColonies would leave that to the Mother Country, those who urge upon\r\nus a system of reciprocal preference are bound to face the conclusions\r\nof their own policy, and are bound to recognise that that request, if\r\nit is to be given effect to in any symmetrical, logical, complete,\r\nsatisfactory, or even fair and just manner, must involve new taxes to\r\nus on seven or eight staple articles of consumption in this country. I\r\nlay it down, without hesitation, that no fair system of Imperial\r\npreference can be established which does not include taxes on bread,\r\non meat, on that group of food-stuffs classified under the head of\r\ndairy produce, on wool and leather, and on other necessaries of\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIf that be so, seven or eight new taxes would have to be imposed to\r\ngive effect to this principle you have brought before us. Those taxes\r\nwould have to figure every year in our annual Budget. They would have\r\nto figure in the Budget resolutions of every successive year in the\r\nHouse of Commons. There will be two opinions about each of these\r\ntaxes; there will be those who like them and favour the principle, and\r\nwho will applaud the policy, and there will be those who dislike them.\r\nThere will be the powerful interests which will be favoured and the\r\ninterests which will be hurt by their adoption. So you will have, as\r\neach of those taxes comes up for the year, a steady volume of\r\nParliamentary criticism directed at it.\r\n\r\nNow that criticism will, I imagine, flow through every channel by\r\nwhich those taxes may be assailed. It will seek to examine the value,\r\nnecessarily in a canvassing spirit, of the Colonial Preferences as a\r\nreturn for which these taxes are imposed. It will seek to dwell upon\r\nthe hardship to the consumers in this country of the taxes themselves.\r\nIt will stray farther, I think, and it will examine the contributions\r\nwhich the self-governing Dominions make to the general cost of\r\nImperial defence; and will contrast those contributions with a severe\r\nand an almost harsh exactitude with the great charges borne by the\r\nMother Country.\r\n\r\nThere has just been a debate upon that subject in the House of\r\nCommons; but the manner in which that question when raised was\r\nreceived by the whole House, ought, I think, to give great\r\nsatisfaction to the representatives of the self-governing Dominions.\r\nWe then refused to embark upon a policy of casting-up balances as\r\nbetween the Colonies and the Mother Country, and, speaking on behalf\r\nof the Colonial Office, I said that the British Empire existed on the\r\nprinciples of a family and not on those of a syndicate. But the\r\nintroduction of those seven or eight taxes into the Budget of every\r\nyear will force a casting-up of balances every year from a severe\r\nfinancial point of view. It has been said, and will be generally\r\nadmitted, that there is no such thing in this country as an\r\nanti-Colonial party. It does not exist. Even parties, like the Irish\r\nParty, not reconciled to the British Government, who take no part in\r\nour public ceremonial, are glad to take opportunities of showing the\r\nrepresentatives of the self-governing Dominions that they welcome them\r\nhere, and desire to receive them with warmth and with cordiality. But\r\nI cannot conceive any process better calculated to manufacture an\r\nanti-Colonial party, than this process of subjecting to the scrutiny\r\nof the House of Commons year by year, through the agency of taxation,\r\nthe profit and loss account, in its narrow, financial aspect, of the\r\nrelations of Great Britain and her Dominions and dependencies.\r\n\r\nThen this system of reciprocal preference, at its very outset, must\r\ninvolve conflict with the principle of self-government, which is the\r\nroot of all our Colonial and Imperial policy. The whole procedure of\r\nour Parliament arises primarily from the consideration of finance,\r\nand finance is the peg on which nearly all our discussions are hung,\r\nand from which many of them arise. That is the historic origin of a\r\ngreat portion of the House of Commons procedure, and there is no more\r\ndeeply rooted maxim than the maxim of \"grievances before supply.\" Now,\r\nlet me suppose a system of preference in operation. When the taxes\r\ncame up to be voted each year, members would use those occasions for\r\ndebating Colonial questions. I can imagine that they would say: We\r\nrefuse to vote the preference tax to this or that self-governing\r\nDominion, unless or until our views, say, on native policy or some\r\nother question of internal importance to the Dominion affected have\r\nbeen met and have been accepted. At present, it is open to the Colony\r\naffected to reply: These matters are matters which concern us; they\r\nare within the scope of responsible, self-governing functions, and you\r\nare not called upon to interfere. It is open for the Dominion\r\nconcerned to say that. It is also open for the representative of the\r\nColonial Office in the House of Commons to say that, too, on their\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nBut it will no longer be open, I think, for any such defence to be\r\noffered when sums of money, or what would be regarded as equivalent\r\nto sums of money, have actually to be voted in the House of Commons\r\nthrough the agency of these taxes for the purpose of according\r\npreference to the different Dominions of the Crown, and I think\r\nmembers will say, \"If you complain of our interference, why do you\r\nforce us to interfere? You have forced us to consider now whether we\r\nwill or will not grant a preference to this or that particular\r\nDominion for this year. We say we are not prepared to do so unless or\r\nuntil our views upon this or that particular internal question in that\r\nDominion have been met and agreed to.\" I see a fertile, frequent, and\r\nalmost inexhaustible source of friction and vexation arising from such\r\ncauses alone.\r\n\r\nThere is a more serious infringement, as it seems to me, upon the\r\nprinciple of self-government. The preferences which have hitherto been\r\naccorded to the Mother Country by the self-governing States of the\r\nBritish Empire are free preferences. They are preferences which have\r\nbeen conceded by those States, in their own interests and also in our\r\ninterests. They are freely given, and, if they gall them, can as\r\nfreely be withdrawn; but the moment reciprocity is established and an\r\nagreement has been entered into to which both sides are parties, the\r\nmoment the preferences become reciprocal, and there is a British\r\npreference against the Australian or Canadian preferences, they become\r\nnot free preferences, but what I venture to call locked preferences,\r\nand they cannot be removed except by agreement, which is not likely to\r\nbe swiftly or easily attained.\r\n\r\nNow I must trench for one moment upon the economic aspect. What does\r\npreference mean? It can only mean one thing. It can only mean better\r\nprices. It can only mean better prices for Colonial goods. I assert,\r\nwithout reserve, that preference can only operate through the agency\r\nof price. All that we are told about improving and developing the\r\ncultivation of tobacco in South Africa, and calling great new areas\r\nfor wheat cultivation into existence in Australia, depends upon the\r\nstimulation of the production of those commodities, through securing\r\nto the producers larger opportunities for profit. I say that unless\r\npreference means better prices it will be ineffective in achieving the\r\nobjects for the sake of which it is urged. But the operation of\r\npreference consists, so far as we are concerned, in putting a penal\r\ntax upon foreign goods, and the object of putting that penal tax on\r\nforeign goods is to enable the Colonial supply to rise to the level of\r\nthe foreign goods plus the tax, and by so conferring upon the Colonial\r\nproducer a greater reward, to stimulate him more abundantly to cater\r\nfor the supply of this particular market. I say, therefore, without\r\nhesitation, that the only manner in which a trade preference can\r\noperate is through the agency of price. If preference does not mean\r\nbetter prices it seems to me a great fraud on those who are asked to\r\nmake sacrifices to obtain it; and by \"better\" prices I mean higher\r\nprices--that is to say, higher prices than the goods are worth, if\r\nsold freely in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nI am quite ready to admit that the fact that you make a particular\r\nbranch of trade more profitable, induces more people to engage in that\r\nbranch of trade. That is what I call stimulating Colonial production\r\nthrough the agency of price. I am quite prepared to admit that a very\r\nsmall tax on staple articles would affect prices in a very small\r\nmanner. Reference has been made to the imposition of a shilling duty\r\non corn, and I think it was Mr. Moor[3] who said, yesterday, that\r\nwhen the shilling duty was imposed prices fell, and when it was taken\r\noff prices rose. That may be quite true. I do not know that it is\r\ntrue, but it may be. The imposition of such a small duty as a shilling\r\non a commodity produced in such vast abundance as wheat, might quite\r\neasily be swamped or concealed by the operation of other more powerful\r\nfactors. A week of unusual sunshine, or a night of late frost, or a\r\nring in the freights, or violent speculation, might easily swamp and\r\ncover the operation of such a small duty; but it is the opinion of\r\nthose whose economic views I share--I cannot put it higher than\r\nthat--that whatever circumstances may apparently conceal the effect of\r\nthe duty on prices, the effect is there all the same, and that any\r\nduty that is imposed upon a commodity becomes a factor in the price of\r\nthat commodity. I should have thought that was an almost incontestable\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nHere you have the two different sides of the bargain, the sellers and\r\nthe buyers, the sellers trying to get all they can, and the buyers\r\ntrying to give as little as they can. An elaborate process of what is\r\ncalled \"the higgling of the market\" goes on all over the world between\r\nexchanges linked up by telegraph, whose prices vary to a sixteenth\r\nand a thirty-second. We are invited to believe that with all that\r\nsubtle process of calculation made from almost minute to minute\r\nthroughout the year, the imposition of a duty or demand for L1,000,000\r\nor L2,000,000 for this or that Government, placed suddenly upon the\r\ncommodity in question as a tax, makes no difference whatever to the\r\ncost to the consumer; that it is borne either by the buyer or by the\r\nseller, or provided in some magical manner. As a matter of fact, the\r\nseller endeavours to transmit the burden to the purchaser, and the\r\npurchaser places it upon the consumer as opportunity may occur in\r\nrelation to the general market situation all over the world.\r\n\r\nThat is by way of digression, only to show that we believe that a tax\r\non a commodity is a factor in its price, which I thought was a\r\ntolerably simple proposition. What a dangerous thing it will be, year\r\nafter year, to associate the idea of Empire, of our kith and kin\r\nbeyond the seas, of these great, young, self-governing Dominions in\r\nwhich our people at present take so much pride, with an enhancement,\r\nhowever small, in the price of the necessary commodities of the life\r\nand the industry of Britain! It seems to me that, quite apart from\r\nthe Parliamentary difficulty to which I have referred, which I think\r\nwould tend to organise and create anti-Colonial sentiment, you would,\r\nby the imposition of duties upon the necessaries of life and of\r\nindustry, breed steadily year by year, and accumulate at the end of a\r\ndecade a deep feeling of sullen hatred of the Colonies, and of\r\nColonial affairs among those poorer people in this country to whom Mr.\r\nLloyd George referred so eloquently yesterday, and whose case, when\r\nstated, appeals to the sympathy of every one round this table. That\r\nwould be a great disaster.\r\n\r\nBut there is another point which occurs to me, and which I would\r\nsubmit respectfully to the Conference in this connection. Great\r\nfluctuations occur in the price of all commodities which are subject\r\nto climatic influences. We have seen enormous fluctuations in meat and\r\ncereals and in food-stuffs generally from time to time in the world's\r\nmarkets. Although we buy in the markets of the whole world we observe\r\nhow much the price of one year varies from that of another year. These\r\nfluctuations are due to causes beyond our control. We cannot control\r\nthe causes which make the earth refuse her fruits at a certain\r\nseason, nor can we, unfortunately, at present, control the speculation\r\nwhich always arises when an unusual stringency is discovered. Compared\r\nto these forces, the taxes which you suggest should be imposed upon\r\nfood and raw materials might, I admit, be small, but they would be the\r\nonly factor in price which would be absolutely in our control.\r\n\r\nIf, from circumstances which we may easily imagine, any of the great\r\nstaple articles which were the subject of preference should be driven\r\nup in price to an unusual height, there would be a demand--and I think\r\nan irresistible demand--in this country that the tax should be\r\nremoved. The tax would bear all the unpopularity. People would say:\r\n\"This, at any rate, we can take off, and relieve the burden which is\r\npressing so heavily upon us.\" But now see the difficulty in which we\r\nshould then be involved. At present all our taxes are under our own\r\ncontrol. An unpopular tax can be removed; if the Government will not\r\nremove it they can be turned out and another Government to remove the\r\ntax can be got from the people by election. It can be done at once.\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer can come down to the House and the\r\ntax can be repealed if there is a sufficiently fierce demand for it.\r\n\r\nBut these food taxes by which you seek to bind the Empire\r\ntogether--these curious links of Empire which you are asking us to\r\nforge laboriously now--would be irremovable, and upon them would\r\ndescend the whole weight and burden of popular anger in time of\r\nsuffering. They would be irremovable, because fixed by treaty with\r\nself-governing Dominions scattered about all over the world, and in\r\nreturn for those duties we should have received concessions in\r\nColonial tariffs on the basis of which their industries would have\r\ngrown up tier upon tier through a long period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough, no doubt, another Conference hastily assembled might be able\r\nto break the shackle which would fasten us--to break that fiscal bond\r\nwhich would join us together and release us from the obligation--that\r\nmight take a great deal of time. Many Parliaments and Governments\r\nwould have to be consulted, and all the difficulties of distance would\r\nintervene to prevent a speedy relief from that deadlock. If the day\r\ncomes in this country when you have a stern demand--and an\r\noverwhelming demand of a Parliament, backed by a vast population\r\nsuffering acutely from high food-prices--that the taxes should be\r\nremoved, and on the other hand the Minister in charge has to get up\r\nand say that he will bring the matter before the next Colonial\r\nConference two years hence, or that he will address the\r\nrepresentatives of the Australian or Canadian Governments through the\r\nagency of the Colonial Office, and that in the meanwhile nothing can\r\nbe done--when you have produced that situation, then, indeed, you will\r\nhave exposed the fabric of the British Empire to a wrench and a shock\r\nwhich it has never before received, and which any one who cares about\r\nit, cannot fail to hope that it may never sustain.\r\n\r\nSuch a deadlock could not be relieved merely by goodwill on either\r\nside. When you begin to deflect the course of trade, you deflect it in\r\nall directions and for all time in both countries which are parties to\r\nthe bargain. Your industries in your respective Colonies would have\r\nexposed themselves to a more severe competition from British goods in\r\ntheir markets, and would have adjusted themselves on a different\r\nbasis, in consequence. Some Colonial producers would have made\r\nsacrifices in that respect for the sake of certain advantages which\r\nwere to be gained by other producers in their country through a\r\nfavoured entry into our market. That one side of the bargain could be\r\nsuddenly removed, without inflicting injustice on the other party to\r\nthe bargain, appears to me an impossibility.\r\n\r\nI submit that preferences, even if economically desirable, would prove\r\nan element of strain and discord in the structure and system of the\r\nBritish Empire. Why, even in this Conference, what has been the one\r\nsubject on which we have differed sharply? It has been this question\r\nof preference. It has been the one apple of discord which has been\r\nthrown into the arena of our discussions. It is quite true we meet\r\nhere with a great fund of goodwill on everybody's part, on the part of\r\nthe Mother Country and on the part of the representatives of the\r\nself-governing Dominions--a great fund of goodwill which has been\r\naccumulated over a long period of time when each party to this great\r\nconfederation has been free to pursue its own line of development\r\nunchecked and untrammelled by interference from the other.\r\n\r\nWe have that to start upon, and consequently have been able to discuss\r\nin a very frank and friendly manner all sorts of questions. We have\r\nwitnessed the spectacle of the British Minister in charge of the trade\r\nof this country defending at length and in detail the fiscal\r\nsystem--the purely domestic, internal fiscal system of this\r\ncountry--from very severe, though perfectly friendly and courteous\r\ncriticism on the part of the other self-governing communities. If that\r\nfund of goodwill to which I have referred had been lacking, if ever a\r\nConference had been called together when there was an actual\r\nanti-colonial party in existence, when there was really a deep hatred\r\nin the minds of a large portion of the people of this country against\r\nthe Colonies and against taxation which was imposed at the request or\r\ndesire of the Colonies, then I think it is quite possible that a\r\nConference such as this would not pass off in the smooth and friendly\r\nmanner in which this has passed off.\r\n\r\nYou would hear recrimination and reproaches exchanged across the\r\ntable; you would hear assertions made that the representatives of the\r\ndifferent States who were parties to the Conference were not really\r\nrepresentatives of the true opinion of their respective populations,\r\nthat the trend of opinion in the country which they professed to\r\nrepresent was opposed to their policy and would shortly effect a\r\nchange in the views which they put forward. You would find all these\r\nundemocratic assertions that representatives duly elected do not\r\nreally speak in the name of their people, and you would, of course,\r\nfind appeals made over the heads of the respective Governments to the\r\nparty organisations which supported them or opposed them in the\r\nrespective countries from which they came. That appears to me to open\r\nup possibilities of very grave and serious dangers in the structure\r\nand fabric of the British Empire, from which I think we ought to\r\nlabour to shield it.\r\n\r\nMy right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has told\r\nthe Conference with perfect truth--in fact it may have been even an\r\nunder-estimate--that if he were to propose the principle of preference\r\nin the present House of Commons, it would be rejected by a majority of\r\nthree to one. But even if the present Government could command a\r\nmajority for the system, they would have no intention whatever of\r\nproposing it. It is not because we are not ready to run electoral\r\nrisks that we decline to be parties to a system of preference; still\r\nless is it because the present Government is unwilling to make\r\nsacrifices, in money or otherwise, in order to weave the Empire more\r\nclosely together. I think a very hopeful deflection has been given to\r\nour discussion when it is suggested that we may find a more convenient\r\nline of advance by improving communications, rather than by erecting\r\ntariffs--by making roads, as it were, across the Empire, rather than\r\nby building walls. It is because we believe the principle of\r\npreference is positively injurious to the British Empire, and would\r\ncreate, not union, but discord, that we have resisted the proposal.\r\n\r\nIt has been a source of regret to all of us that on this subject we\r\ncannot come to an agreement. A fundamental difference of opinion on\r\neconomics, no doubt, makes agreement impossible; but although we\r\nregret that, I do not doubt that in the future, when Imperial\r\nunification has been carried to a stage which it has not now reached,\r\nand will not, perhaps, in our time attain, people in that more\r\nfortunate age will look back to the Conference of 1907 as a date in\r\nthe history of the British Empire when one grand wrong turn was\r\nsuccessfully avoided.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] The following, among others, were present at the Conference:\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Elgin, Secretary of State for the Colonies; Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier, Prime Minister of Canada; Sir F.W. Borden, Minister of Militia\r\nand Defence (Canada); Mr. L.P. Brodeur, Minister of Marine and\r\nFisheries (Canada); Mr. Deakin, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia; Sir W. Lyne, Minister of Trade and Customs (Australia); Sir\r\nJoseph Ward, Prime Minister of New Zealand; Dr. L.S.

Mackay, on behalf of the India Office.\r\n\r\n[3] The Prime Minister of Natal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL PREFERENCE\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _July 15, 1907_\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lyttelton had moved the following vote of censure:\r\n\r\n      \"That this House regrets that his Majesty's Government\r\n      have declined the invitation unanimously preferred by the\r\n      Prime Ministers of the self-governing Colonies, to\r\n      consider favourably any form of Colonial Preference or\r\n      any measures for closer commercial union of the Empire on\r\n      a preferential basis.\" (Mr. Lyttelton.)\r\n\r\n    This was met on behalf of the Government by the following\r\n    Amendment:\r\n\r\n      \"To leave out all after the word 'that' and add the words\r\n      'In the opinion of this House, the permanent unity of the\r\n      British Empire will not be secured through a system of\r\n      preferential duties based upon the protective taxation of\r\n      food.'\" (Mr. Soares)\r\n\r\n    The vote of censure was rejected, and the Amendment carried\r\n    by 404 to 111.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vote of censure is a very serious thing. When it is moved with great\r\nformality on behalf of the official Opposition, it is intended always\r\nto raise a plain and decisive issue. I must, however, observe that of\r\nall the votes of censure which have been proposed in recent times in\r\nthis House, the one we are now discussing is surely the most curious.\r\nThe last Government was broken up three years ago on this very\r\nquestion of Imperial preference. After the Government had been broken\r\nup, a continuous debate proceeded in the country for two years and a\r\nhalf, and it was terminated by the general election. This Parliament\r\nis the result of that election, and there is not a single gentleman on\r\nthis Ministerial Bench who is not pledged, in the most specific terms,\r\nnot to grant a preferential tariff to the Colonies. Now, because we\r\nhave kept that promise, because we are opposed to preferential\r\ntariffs, because we have declined to grant preferential tariffs, and\r\nbecause we have done what all along we declared we were going to do,\r\nand were returned to do, we are made the object of this vote of\r\ncensure.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, \"We do not blame you for keeping your promise, but for\r\nmaking the pledge.\" But what did the Leader of the Opposition promise?\r\nHe promised most emphatically before the election that if he were in\r\npower as Prime Minister when this Colonial Conference took place, he\r\nwould not grant preference to the Colonies. On many occasions the\r\nright hon. gentleman said that not one, but two elections would be\r\nnecessary before he would be entitled to take that tremendous step. I\r\nhave the right hon. gentleman's words here. Speaking at Manchester in\r\nJanuary 1905, the right hon. gentleman said: \"If that scheme were\r\ncarried out, I do not see that we could be called on to decide the\r\ncolonial aspect of this question until not only one, but two elections\r\nhave passed.\" Yet the right hon. gentleman is prepared, I presume, to\r\njoin in a vote of censure on his Majesty's Government for not granting\r\nthat preference which he himself was prohibited from granting by the\r\nmost precise and particular engagement.\r\n\r\nIs it a vote of censure on the Government at all? Is it not really a\r\nvote of censure on the general election? Is it not a cry of petulant\r\nvexation at the natural, ordinary, long-expected sequence of events?\r\n\r\nThe right hon. gentleman[4] who moved the Resolution made a very mild\r\nand conciliatory speech. But he confined himself to generalities. He\r\navoided anything like a statement of concrete proposals which he\r\nthinks the Government ought to adopt. Those who take part in this\r\ncontroversy nowadays avoid any statement of the concrete proposals\r\nthat would follow if their view were adopted. We are told what a\r\nsplendid thing preference is, what noble results it would achieve,\r\nwhat inexpressible happiness and joy it would bring to all parts of\r\nthe Empire and to all parts of the earth, what wealth would be\r\ncreated, how the Exchequer would gain, and how the food of the people\r\nwould cheapen in price. But, though the Government is blamed for not\r\nacting on these suggestions, we are never told what is the schedule of\r\ntaxes which it is proposed to introduce to give effect to these\r\nsplendid and glittering aspirations.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly impossible to discuss colonial preference apart from\r\nthe schedule of duties on which it is to be based. It is idle to\r\nattempt to discuss it without a definite proposal as to the subjects\r\nof taxation and as to the degree to which those different subjects are\r\nto be taxed. And the right hon. gentleman the Member for West\r\nBirmingham, when he dealt with this question, felt that in common\r\nfairness he must be precise and definite. We know what he proposed in\r\nthe way of taxation on corn, meat, fruit, and dairy produce. What we\r\nwant to know is this. Is that tariff before us now? Do the Opposition\r\nstand by the right hon. Member for West Birmingham, or do they abandon\r\nhim? That is what the House and the Government want to know--and that\r\nis what the Colonies want to know. It is indispensable to the\r\ndiscussion of this question that there should be a clear statement\r\nfrom the Leader of the Opposition whether or not we are to regard the\r\nGlasgow preferential tariff of the right hon. Member for West\r\nBirmingham as still current as a practical policy.\r\n\r\nThen the House has been told that the Government might have given a\r\npreference on dutiable articles. Such a preference would introduce\r\ninto our fiscal system an entirely new, and, as the Government think,\r\nthe wholly vicious feature of discriminating between one class of\r\nproducers and another. The whole basis of our financial and fiscal\r\npolicy is, that it draws no distinction whatever between different\r\nclasses of producers, whether they reside here or abroad, whether they\r\nlive in foreign countries or in our Colonies. I am quite prepared to\r\nstate that proposition in its simplest form. That is the fundamental\r\nprinciple of our fiscal system, and there is no discrimination. We\r\nhave but one measure to give to those who trade with us--the just\r\nmeasure of equality, and there can be no better measure than that.\r\n\r\nWe are charged with pedantry in dealing with the Colonial Conference,\r\nthrough not making some concession upon existing dutiable articles.\r\nThe Colonial representatives, when they asked for a preference on wine\r\nand tobacco, did not ask for it because it was of value to them by\r\nitself. They knew well that the operation of such a preference must be\r\nunfair and unequal. They knew well that Canada, which has the most\r\nsolid claims upon us for a preferential recognition, would receive no\r\nbenefit from such a preference. But the Colonial representatives of\r\nSouth Africa asked for a preference on wine and tobacco in order that,\r\nas they avowed with candour, we should \"concede the principle.\" That\r\nis a perfectly proper proceeding on their part; it is the natural way\r\nof advancing the views which they hold, because it would lead up to\r\nthe larger principle and the larger policy.\r\n\r\nBut the Government are opposed in this case to \"the larger policy.\"\r\nThe Government sit now on these Benches because they are opposed to it\r\nas a Government and as a Party. It is one of the fundamental\r\nconditions of our existence that we are opposed to such a policy. How,\r\nthen, by any process of argument, can the Government be censured for\r\nnot making an exception which must inevitably have led to and would\r\navowedly have been used for the breaking of the great rule to which\r\nthey have committed themselves?\r\n\r\nIt is a dangerous thing in this controversy, with the ugly rush of\r\nvested interests always lying in the wake of the Protectionist\r\nmovement to be considered, to make even verbal concessions. Some time\r\nago I made a speech in which I said that there was no objection to the\r\nextension of inter-colonial preference. By this I meant the reduction\r\nof duties between Colonies which have already a discriminating tariff;\r\nand it seemed to me in such a case that there is a net reduction of\r\nduty to the good. I do not see any objection to that, because under\r\nthe most-favoured-nation principle we gain any advantage which is\r\ngained by either party to the transaction. In any case, the sums\r\ninvolved in inter-colonial preference at the present time are\r\nextremely small, and, however that might be, the matter is one which\r\nis wholly outside our control, because we have no authority over the\r\nColonies in this respect, and we may just as well look pleasant about\r\nit and accord a sympathetic attitude to such a process.\r\n\r\nYes; but let those who reproach us with pedantry and with not showing\r\na sympathetic desire to meet the Colonies listen to this: When such a\r\nstatement is made by a Minister, is it accepted as a desire on the\r\npart of the Government to extend sympathetic treatment to the\r\nColonies? Not at all. It is taken as an admission, and used for the\r\npurpose of trying to pretend that the Government have abandoned the\r\nprinciple of their opposition to the larger question of Imperial\r\npreference. If, although we think them unsatisfactory, we were, out of\r\ncomplaisance, to accord the small preferences suggested upon dutiable\r\narticles, we should be told in a minute that we had given up every\r\nlogical foothold against preference, and that nothing prevented us\r\nimposing a tax on bread and meat except our inability to follow the\r\ndrift of our own arguments.\r\n\r\nI have referred to preference, but there is another proposal. The\r\nright hon. gentleman the Member for St. George's, Hanover Square, put\r\nforward a proposal earlier in the year, and it was renewed in a\r\nslightly different form by Mr. Deakin[5] at the Conference. The\r\nproposal was to impose a 1 per cent. _ad valorem_ surtax on all\r\nforeign merchandise coming into the ports of the British Empire. That\r\nis the proposal which has been put forward as the least objectionable\r\nform of the preferential proposals, and it has been said of it that it\r\nwas the least objectionable because it gave no loophole for the\r\ncorruption which may spring up in the wake of the other proposals.\r\n\r\nLet me ask the House to examine this proposal for a moment. Has any\r\nserious, civilised Government--I ask for information--ever been to the\r\npains and trouble of erecting round their coasts a tariff, with all\r\nits complications, with the need of exacting certificates of origin on\r\nevery class of goods, with the need of demanding strict assessment of\r\nall commodities brought to their shores--has any nation ever erected\r\nthe vast and complicated network which would be involved in such a\r\nduty, simply for the paltry purpose of imposing a duty of 1 per cent.?\r\nI say there is no argument and no reason for such a course, and the\r\nonly argument which could justify it is the argument used by Dr.\r\nSmartt at the Colonial Conference when he said (page 514 of the Blue\r\nBook), \"The foreigner pays, and we do not.\" Mr. Deakin felt the force\r\nof the objection which would be entertained in this country to\r\nintroducing such a tariff as the right hon. gentleman has proposed,\r\nsimply for fiscal purposes, and he proceeded to say that Great\r\nBritain, if she was a party to such a bargain, should be permitted to\r\nraise the money in her own way, and to contribute her proportion to\r\nthe common fund. That was a great concession to the self-government of\r\nthe Mother Country.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt a great difference between subventions and\r\npreferences. A subvention may be raised by a perfectly orthodox fiscal\r\nprocess. No more money is taken from the taxpayer than is required.\r\nThe whole yield of the tax by which the subvention may be raised\r\ncertainly goes to the Exchequer, and when the subvention is paid to\r\nthe foreign or Colonial Government, it does not go, as a preference\r\nwould go, to benefit particular interests in the Colony, but it goes\r\nto the Government of the Colony for the general purposes of State, and\r\nnot for private advantage on either side. Therefore it seems to me\r\nthat the method of subvention is on all grounds to be preferred to the\r\nmethod of preference.\r\n\r\nIt is of course necessary, however, in examining a question of\r\nsubvention to look at it on its merits. This proposal of 1 per cent.\r\nput forward by Mr. Deakin carried the support of the official\r\nspokesman of the Opposition. Let us look at it on its merits. Look\r\nfirst at the proportions on which this new fund was to be subscribed.\r\nCanada was \"to dedicate\"--that was the expression used by Mr.\r\nDeakin--L400,000, New Zealand L20,000, Newfoundland L6,000, Cape\r\nColony L40,000, Natal L26,000, Great Britain L4,500,000, and\r\nAustralia--the proposing body--what was she to \"dedicate\" to this\r\nfund? No more than L100,000 a year, or one forty-fifth part of the\r\ncontribution which was to be made by this country. And for what object\r\nwas this fund to be accumulated? It is hard enough for the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer to raise the money to carry on so great an\r\nestablishment as this country is forced necessarily to maintain. But\r\nhere is a proposal to raise no less than L4,500,000 of extra taxation.\r\nFor what objects? For objects not specified, for objects not yet\r\ndiscovered, for objects which could not be stated by those who made\r\nthe proposal. The right hon. gentleman said that there was to be a\r\nmeeting of the representatives of the different Colonies in the\r\ndifferent great cities of the Empire--one different great city each\r\nyear for seven years, excluding London, where there was to be no\r\nmeeting, and they were to search for a method of spending this money.\r\nSuch plans have only to be stated to fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe House will see that the real essential fallacy of the\r\nprotectionist proposal is the idea that taxation is a good thing in\r\nitself, that it should be imposed for the fun of the thing, and then,\r\nhaving done it for amusement, we should go round afterwards and look\r\nfor attractive methods of expenditure in order to give support to the\r\nproject. These are the actual proposals made to us at the Colonial\r\nConference. These are the sort of proposals in respect of which we\r\nare, forsooth, to be censured because we have not found it possible in\r\nthe name of the Government of this country to give our assent to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI will submit a proposition to the House as a broad, general rule. I\r\ndaresay the Leader of the Opposition may rake up some ingenious, hard\r\ncase in conflict with it; but as a broad, general rule I believe it\r\nwill be found true to say that there is no power in a Government to\r\nimpose indirect taxation outside the limits of its territorial\r\nsovereignty. Although I am quite ready to admit that, by sudden and\r\nunexpected alterations of the tariff, temporary advantage might be\r\ngained, and some share of the wealth of other people and other\r\ncountries might be netted for this or that set of traders within your\r\nown border, in the long run the whole yield of any tax, export or\r\nimport, will come home to the people of that country by whom it is\r\nimposed. It will come home plus the whole cost of collecting the tax,\r\nand plus, further, the inconvenience and burden of the network of\r\ntaxation which is needed. It will come home to them, if they be\r\nconsumers, in the quantity, quality, or price of the articles they\r\nconsume, and, if exporters, in the profit, convenience, or reserve\r\npower of the business which they conduct.\r\n\r\nThere is no parity between the sacrifices demanded of the Mother\r\nCountry and the proposals of preference made by the various Colonies.\r\nTo them it is merely a fresh application of their existing fiscal\r\nsystem. To us it is a fiscal revolution. To them it is a mere\r\nrewriting of their schedules to give an increased measure of\r\nprotection to their home producers. To us it is a tax on food, and, as\r\nI assert again and again, upon raw material, and thus upon all the\r\nindustries of these islands. If the Conference has established one\r\nthing clearly it is this, that none of the great self-governing\r\nColonies of the British Empire are prepared to give us effective\r\naccess to their own markets in competition with their home producers.\r\nThat was established with absolute clearness; and even if they were\r\nprepared to give us effective access to their home markets, I submit\r\nto the House that, having regard to the great preponderance of our\r\nforeign trade as against our Colonial trade, it would not be worth our\r\nwhile to purchase the concession which they would then offer at the\r\ncost of disturbing and dislocating the whole area of our trade.\r\nTherefore, we propose to adhere, and are prepared if necessary to be\r\ncensured for adhering to our general financial system, which is\r\ngoverned by the rule that there should be no taxation except for\r\nrevenue, and based on the commercial principle of the equal treatment\r\nof all nations, and the most-favoured-nation treatment from those\r\nnations in return.\r\n\r\nImportant as are the economical arguments against a preferential\r\npolicy, they are in my opinion less grave than the political\r\ndisadvantages. On other occasions I have addressed the House on the\r\ngrave danger and detriment to the working of our Colonial system which\r\nmust follow the intermingling of the affairs of the British Empire in\r\nthe party politics and financial politics of this country. To\r\nestablish a preferential system with the Colonies involving\r\ndifferential duties upon food is to make the bond of Imperial unity\r\ndependent year after year upon the weather and the crops.\r\n\r\nAnd there is even a more unstable foundation for Imperial unity. Does\r\nit never occur to right hon. gentlemen opposite that this solution\r\nwhich they offer of the problem of Imperial unity places the Empire\r\nnot on a national, but on a purely party basis, and upon a basis\r\nrepudiated by at least half the nation? Some day it may be that they\r\nwill return triumphant from a general election. As party politicians\r\nthey may rejoice, yet I think a wise statesman would try to win for\r\nthe British Empire, our Colonial relations, the same sort of position,\r\nhigh above the struggle of Parties, which is now so happily occupied\r\nby the Crown and the Courts of Justice, which in less degree, though\r\nin an increasing degree, is coming to be occupied by the fighting\r\nServices. Whatever advantages from a Party point of view, or from the\r\npoint of view of gratifying Colonial opinion, may be gained by food\r\npreferences, they would be very small compared with the enormous boon\r\nof keeping the field of Colonial politics separate from the social and\r\neconomic issues on which Parties in this country are so fiercely\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to take a still wider view of this question. If I quote\r\nthe right hon. gentleman the Member for West Birmingham, let me assure\r\nthe House that I do not do so for the purpose of making any petty\r\ncharge of inconsistency, but because the words which I am going to\r\nread are wise and true words, and stand the test of time. When the\r\nright hon. gentleman spoke at Manchester in 1897, not in the distant\r\ndays before the great Home Rule split, but when he was already a\r\nMinister in the Unionist Government, and had been Secretary of State\r\nfor the Colonies for nearly two years, he used these words, of the\r\nhighest wisdom: \"Anything in the direction of an Imperial Commercial\r\nLeague would weaken the Empire internally and excite the permanent\r\nhostility of the whole world. It would check the free imports of the\r\nfood of the people. It is impracticable; but if it were practicable,\r\nand done in the name of the Empire, it would make the Empire odious to\r\nthe working people, it would combine the whole world against us, and\r\nit would be a cause of irritation and menace. Our free commerce makes\r\nfor the peace of the world.\"\r\n\r\nLet us then seek to impress year after year upon the British Empire an\r\ninclusive and not an exclusive character. We who sit on this side of\r\nthe House, who look forward to larger brotherhoods and more exact\r\nstandards of social justice, value and cherish the British Empire\r\nbecause it represents more than any other similar organisation has\r\never represented, the peaceful co-operation of all sorts of men in all\r\nsorts of countries, and because we think it is, in that respect at\r\nleast, a model of what we hope the whole world will some day become.\r\nThe House has to-night a considerable and important opportunity. If in\r\nrejecting this vote of censure, which is so ill-conceived and so\r\nlittle deserved, we choose to adopt the Amendment, we shall have\r\nwritten upon the records of Parliament a profound political truth,\r\nwhich will not, I think, soon be challenged, and which, I believe,\r\nwill never be overthrown.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Mr Lyttelton.\r\n\r\n[5] Prime Minister of the Australian Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF LORDS\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _June 29, 1907_\r\n\r\n    On June 24, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had moved:\r\n\r\n      \"That, in order to give effect to the will of the people\r\n      as expressed by their elected representatives, it is\r\n      necessary that the power of the other House to alter or\r\n      reject Bills passed by this House should be so restricted\r\n      by law as to secure that within the limits of a single\r\n      Parliament the final decision of the Commons shall\r\n      prevail.\"\r\n\r\n    This was carried after three days' debate by 315 to 100.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will not venture at any length into an abstract constitutional\r\ndiscussion upon this Motion, because, after all, we have an extremely\r\npractical issue before us. It seems to me that this great question\r\nmust be looked at from three points of view. There is the issue\r\nbetween the two Houses; there is the issue between the two political\r\nParties; and then there is the national issue. The quarrel which is\r\nnow open between the House of Lords and the House of Commons arises\r\nfrom two events--the general election of 1906, and the rejection of\r\nthe measures of the new Liberal Government, culminating in the\r\ndestruction of the Education Bill by the House of Lords at the end of\r\nthat year. Either of these events is memorable in itself, but placed\r\nin juxtaposition and considered together they have a multiplied\r\nsignificance. The general election of 1906 was the most vehement\r\nexpression of public opinion which this generation has known; and that\r\nexpression of public will was countered in the December of the same\r\nyear by the most arbitrary and uncompromising assertion of\r\naristocratic privilege upon record.\r\n\r\nLet the House think of it. The process of the election of Members of\r\nParliament is extremely elaborate. The candidates go about the country\r\nfor two or three weeks saying all they have to say for themselves in\r\nthe different constituencies which they are contesting; at the end of\r\nthat exhaustive discussion there is an elaborate process of voting;\r\nthe returns are counted with the most scrupulous care; and as the\r\nresult 670 Members, representing 6,000,000 of voters and many more who\r\ntake a deep interest in public affairs but have no votes, are\r\nreturned to the House of Commons in the name of the people of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. The new Parliament assembles. Scarcely any\r\nquestion at the election had been more a test question, so far as the\r\nsupporters of the Government are concerned, than the question of the\r\namendment of the education system of the country. A Bill dealing with\r\neducation is brought forward as the principal measure of the first\r\nsession of the new Parliament. Weeks are occupied in its discussion.\r\nIt represents the fulfilment of the election pledges of every Member\r\nwho supported it. The Bill is passed by perhaps the largest majority\r\nthat ever sent a Bill from this House to another place.\r\n\r\nNor was it a revolutionary Bill, to turn the world upside down and\r\ninside out; on the contrary, it was a Bill which, if vitiated in any\r\nrespect, was vitiated by the element of compromise. Immense\r\nconcessions were made in it, and rightly, I think, to conscientious\r\nand agitated minorities. It was a Bill which so moderate and\r\nconsistent a statesman as the Duke of Devonshire, of whose ill-health\r\nthe House learns with grave concern, urged the House of Lords to pass\r\ninto law.\r\n\r\nSir, the Leader of the Opposition told us the other day that it was\r\nthe habit of his Majesty's Government to introduce Bills which they did\r\nnot mean to pass. No one--not even the right hon. gentleman\r\nhimself--can say that the Government have not earnestly desired to pass\r\nthe Education Bill. Every concession that could be conceived was made,\r\nbut to what purpose? After the House of Commons had humbled itself\r\nbefore the House of Lords, after we had gone to the extreme limit of\r\nconcession which self-respect, which a proper sense of the dignity of\r\nthis House, and a due observance of the pledges of the Liberal Party\r\npermitted, the House of Lords curtly, bluntly, uncharitably, and\r\nharshly flung the Bill out in our faces mutilated and destroyed. I do\r\nnot wish to import an element of heat into this discussion, but I\r\nrespectfully submit to the Conservative Party that that act on the part\r\nof the House of Lords places them in a new position--a new position in\r\nthe sense that never before had their old position been taken up so\r\nnakedly, so brazenly, and so uncompromisingly.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we have an excuse put before us with much suavity of\r\nlanguage in these debates--we are told that the House of Lords seeks\r\nto interpret the will of the people, and it is explained that by \"the\r\nwill of the people,\" what is meant is the persistent, sub-conscious\r\nwill, as opposed to any articulate expression of it. The right hon.\r\ngentleman who leads the Opposition told us that what he meant by the\r\npersistent will was the will of the people expressed continuously over\r\na period of thirty years. That is what he called \"democracy properly\r\nunderstood.\"\r\n\r\nHaving regard to that part of the question which concerns the issue\r\nbetween the two Houses, we repudiate emphatically the claim of the\r\nother House to what the French call _faire l'ange_--to \"play the\r\nangel,\" to know better than the people themselves what the people\r\nwant, to have a greater authority to speak in the name of the people\r\nthan their representatives sent to Parliament by the elaborate process\r\nI have described. To dispute the authority of a newly elected\r\nParliament is something very like an incitement to violence on the\r\npart of the other House. The noble Lord[6] laughs; but we are anxious\r\nto convince him and his friends that we are in earnest. We go through\r\nall the processes which the Constitution prescribes, we produce an\r\nenormous majority, and we express the opinion of that majority, but\r\nstill the noble Lord and other noble Lords, less intelligent, but more\r\nremote, tell us that they are not convinced. What steps do they\r\nsuggest that we should take in order to bring home to them the\r\nearnestness of our plea? What steps do they suggest that the people\r\nshould take in order to assert their wishes? I hold entirely by what I\r\nsaid that to dispute the authority of an elected body fresh from its\r\nconstituents is a deliberate incitement to the adoption of lawless and\r\nunconstitutional methods. The assertion which the House of Lords made\r\nat the end of last year is an intolerable assertion. I believe the\r\ncountry is altogether unprepared for it; and I wonder it was thought\r\nworth while to risk an institution which has lasted so many centuries,\r\nin the very skirmish line of Party warfare.\r\n\r\nI am aware there is a special reason for the temerity of the House of\r\nLords. It is not a very complimentary reason to the Members or the\r\nleaders of the late Government, but it is argued that the Conservative\r\nParty cannot be worse than they are. No matter what they do, nor how\r\nthey are hated or reprobated by the country, the Conservative Party\r\ncannot possibly occupy a more humiliating and unpleasant position than\r\nthey did after the last two years of the late Administration.\r\nConsequently, having reached the low-water mark of political fortune,\r\nthey think they can afford to be a little reckless, and that at the\r\nvery worst they will be returned in their present numerical\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThat is a very natural explanation of their action; but if we for our\r\npart were to accept the assertion lately made by the House of\r\nLords--an assertion which is the furthest point to which aristocratic\r\nprivilege has attained in modern times--that assertion itself would\r\nbecome only the starting-point for a whole new series of precedents\r\nand of constitutional retrogressions; and worse than that, if by any\r\nchance, having raised this issue, we were to be defeated upon it--if\r\nhaving placed this Resolution on the records of the House we were to\r\nfail to give effect to it, or were to suffer an electoral reverse as\r\nthe conclusion of it--then good-bye to the power of the House of\r\nCommons. All that long process of advance in democratic institutions\r\nwhich has accompanied the growth of the power of the House of Commons,\r\nand which has also been attended by an expansion of the circles of\r\ncomfort and culture among the people of this country--all that long\r\nprocess which has gone steadily onward for 200 years, and which has\r\nalmost exclusively occupied the politics of the nineteenth\r\ncentury--will have reached its culmination. It will have come in\r\ncontact with that barrier of which we have heard so much in this\r\ndebate. The tide will have turned, and in the recoil of the waters\r\nthey will gradually leave exposed again, altered no doubt by the\r\nconditions of the age, all the old assertions of aristocratic and\r\nplutocratic domination which we had fondly hoped had been engulfed for\r\never.\r\n\r\nHon. gentlemen opposite would be well advised to treat this Resolution\r\nseriously. This Parliament is still young, but there are some things\r\nat which they have laughed which have already become accomplished\r\nfacts, I could not have during the past eighteen months listened to\r\ntheir taunts about the permanence of Chinese labour without reflecting\r\nnow with satisfaction that Chinese labour is going. Yes, and other\r\npeople may follow. We are only at the beginning of this struggle. We\r\nare not necessarily committed to every detail of the proposal; we are\r\nopening the first lines for a great siege, we have to sap up to the\r\nadvanced parallels, to establish our batteries, and at no distant date\r\nopen our bombardment. It may be many months before we shall be able to\r\ndiscern where there is a practicable breach; but the assault will come\r\nin due time.\r\n\r\nThe right hon. gentleman opposite[7] said he welcomed this contest\r\nwith great confidence. I wonder if the Conservative Party realise, to\r\nuse an expressive vulgarism, what they are \"letting themselves in for\"\r\nwhen this question comes to be fought out on every platform in every\r\nconstituency in the country? They will not have to defend an ideal\r\nSecond Chamber; they will not be able to confine themselves to airy\r\ngeneralities about a bicameral system and its advantages; they will\r\nhave to defend _this_ Second Chamber as it is--one-sided, hereditary,\r\nunpurged, unrepresentative, irresponsible, absentee. They will have to\r\ndefend it with all its anomalies, all its absurdities, and all its\r\npersonal bias--with all its achievements that have darkened the pages\r\nof the history of England. And let me say that weighty constitutional\r\nauthorities have not considered that the policy on which we have\r\nembarked in moving this Resolution is unreasonable. Mr. Bagehot says\r\nof the House of Lords:\r\n\r\n\"It may lose its veto as the Crown has lost its veto. If most of its\r\nmembers neglect their duties, if all its members continue to be of one\r\nclass, and that not quite the best; if its doors are shut against\r\ngenius that cannot found a family, and ability which has not L5,000 a\r\nyear, its power will be less year by year, and at last be gone, as so\r\nmuch kingly power is gone--no one knows how.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the position of the Conservative Party when they attempt to\r\ndefend the House of Lords? They are always telling us to imitate the\r\nColonies; they are always telling us that we ought to adopt the fiscal\r\nsystems and other methods employed in the self-governing Colonies; but\r\nwhat is their unprejudiced view of the relations which are held\r\nbetween the two Chambers under the bicameral system in the Colonies\r\nand as established by their own Australian Commonwealth Act in the\r\nlast Parliament? By that Act they have given power to the Lower\r\nChamber to over-ride the Upper Chamber in certain circumstances. The\r\nCommonwealth Act says that when the Chambers differ they shall meet\r\ntogether, and that the majority shall decide, measures being taken,\r\nhowever, that the numbers of the Upper Chamber shall not be such as\r\nto swamp the opinion of the Lower Chamber. Imitating them, and\r\nfollowing in their footsteps, we have adopted such a plan in the\r\nTransvaal and Orange River Colony Constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe Leader of the Opposition asked us yesterday whether the people are\r\nnot often wrong, and he proceeded characteristically to suggest that\r\nhe always considered them wrong when they voted against him. I am not\r\nprepared to take such a rough-and-ready test of the opinion and of the\r\nmental processes of the British democracy as that. I should hesitate\r\nto say that when the people pronounce against a particular measure or\r\nParty they have not pretty good reasons for doing so. I am not at all\r\nconvinced that in 1900 the electors were wrong in saying that the war\r\nshould be finished--by those who made it. Even in the last election I\r\ncould, I daresay, find some few reasons to justify the decision which\r\nthe people then took; and if we should be so unfortunate in the future\r\nas to lose that measure of public confidence now abundantly given to\r\nus, then I shall not be too sure that it will not be our own fault.\r\nCertain am I that we could not take any step more likely to forfeit\r\nthe confidence of the people of England, than to continue in office\r\nafter we have lost the power to pass effective legislation.\r\n\r\nI will retort the question of the Leader of the Opposition by another\r\nquestion. Has the House of Lords ever been right? Has it ever been\r\nright in any of the great settled controversies which are now beyond\r\nthe reach of Party argument? Was it right in delaying Catholic\r\nemancipation and the removal of Jewish disabilities? Was it right in\r\ndriving this country to the verge of revolution in its effort to\r\ndefeat the passage of reform? Was it right in resisting the Ballot\r\nBill? Was it right in the almost innumerable efforts it made to\r\nprevent this House dealing with the purity of its own electoral\r\nmachinery? Was it right in endeavouring to prevent the abolition of\r\npurchase in the Army? Was it right in 1880, when it rejected the\r\nCompensation for Disturbance Bill? I defy the Party opposite to\r\nproduce a single instance of a settled controversy in which the House\r\nof Lords was right.\r\n\r\n[An honourable Member: What about Home Rule?]\r\n\r\nI expected that interruption. That is not a settled controversy. It is\r\na matter which lies in the future. The cases I have mentioned are\r\ncases where we have carried the law into effect and have seen the\r\nresults, and found that they have been good.\r\n\r\nLet me remind the House that, but for a lucky accident, but for the\r\nfact that Letters Patent can be issued by the Crown and do not require\r\nthe statutory assent of Parliament, it would very likely have been\r\nimpossible for this Government to have made the constitutional\r\nsettlement in the Transvaal and in the Orange River Colony, because\r\nthe Constitutions would probably have been mutilated or cast out by\r\nthe House of Lords, and the Executive Government would have found\r\nitself responsible for carrying out the government of Colonies on\r\nlines of which it wholly disapproved, and after their own policy had\r\nbeen rejected.\r\n\r\nI proceed to inquire on what principle the House of Lords deals with\r\nLiberal measures. The right hon. Member for Dover[8] by an imaginative\r\neffort assures us that they occupy the position of the umpire. Are\r\nthey even a sieve, a strainer, to stop legislation if it should reveal\r\nan undue or undesirable degree of Radicalism or Socialism? Are they\r\nthe complementary critic--the critic who sees all the things which the\r\nordinary man does not see? No one can maintain it. The attitude which\r\nthe House of Lords adopts towards Liberal measures is purely tactical.\r\nWhen they returned to their \"gilded Chamber\" after the general\r\nelection they found on the Woolsack and on the Treasury Bench a Lord\r\nChancellor and a Government with which they were not familiar. When\r\ntheir eyes fell upon those objects, there was a light in them which\r\nmeant one thing--murder; murder tempered, no doubt, by those\r\nprudential considerations which always restrain persons from acts\r\nwhich are contrary to the general feeling of the society in which they\r\nlive. But their attitude towards the present Government has from the\r\nbeginning been to select the best and most convenient opportunity of\r\nhumiliating and discrediting them, and finally of banishing them from\r\npower.\r\n\r\nExamine, in contrast with that of the Education Bill, their treatment\r\nof the Trades Disputes Bill. Lord Halsbury described that Bill as\r\noutrageous and tyrannous, and said it contained a section more\r\ndisgraceful than any that appeared in any English Statute. On what\r\nground then did they pass that Bill, if it was not the ground of\r\npolitical opportunism and partisanship? What safeguard can such a\r\nSecond Chamber be to the commercial interests of this country? Is it\r\nnot clear that they are prepared to sacrifice, if necessary, what they\r\nconsider to be the true interests of the country in order to secure an\r\nadvantage for the political Party whose obedient henchmen they are?\r\nThe Trades Disputes Bill was a very inconvenient measure for the\r\nConservative Party to leave open, because so long as it was left open\r\na great mass of democratic opinion was directed against them. And so\r\nit was passed. On the other hand, the Education Bill was very\r\ninconvenient for the Liberal Party to leave open, because they are\r\nsupported by Catholics and Nonconformists, and to bring in an\r\nEducation Bill to satisfy those two extremes is not to solve a\r\nproblem, but to solve a double acrostic. So that Bill was not passed.\r\nUpon a measure which it would be inconvenient to the Liberal Party to\r\nleave open the House of Lords rejected all compromise. Upon a measure\r\nwhich it would be inconvenient for the Conservative Party to leave\r\nopen, they submitted at once--their action being irrespective of\r\nmerits in either case. That, I suppose, is what the Leader of the\r\nOpposition called \"an averaging machinery.\"\r\n\r\nI press these points in order to justify me in making this statement,\r\nthat the House of Lords, as it at present exists and acts, is not a\r\nnational institution, but a Party dodge, an apparatus and instrument\r\nat the disposal of one political faction; and it is used in the most\r\nunscrupulous manner to injure and humiliate the opposite faction. When\r\nConservative Members go about the country defending a Second Chamber,\r\nlet them remember that this is the kind of Second Chamber they have to\r\ndefend, and when they defend the veto let them remember that it is a\r\nveto used, not for national purposes, but for the grossest purposes of\r\nunscrupulous political partisanship.\r\n\r\nI have dealt with the issues between Houses, and I come to that\r\nbetween Parties. Great changes in a community are very often\r\nunperceived; the focus of reality moves from one institution in the\r\nState to another, and almost imperceptibly. Sometimes the forms of\r\ninstitutions remain almost the same in all ceremonial aspects, and yet\r\nthere will be one institution which under pretentious forms is only\r\nthe husk of reality, and another which under a humble name is in fact\r\nthe operative pivot of the social system. Constitutional writers have\r\nmuch to say about the estates of the realm, and a great deal to say\r\nabout their relation to each other, and to the Sovereign. All that is\r\nfound to be treated upon at length. But they say very little about the\r\nParty system. And, after all, the Party system is the dominant fact in\r\nour experience. Nothing is more striking in the last twenty-five years\r\nthan the growth and expansion of Party organisation, and the way in\r\nwhich millions of people and their votes have been woven into its\r\nscope.\r\n\r\nThere are two great characteristics about the Party institutions of\r\nthis country: the equipoise between them, and their almost incredible\r\ndurability. We have only to look at the general elections of 1900 and\r\n1906. I do not suppose any circumstances could be more depressing for\r\na political Party than the circumstances in which the Liberal Party\r\nfought the election in 1900, except the circumstances in which the\r\nConservative Party fought the election of 1906. At those two\r\nelections, what was the salient fact? The great mass of the voters of\r\neach political Party stood firm by the standard of their Party, and\r\nalthough there was an immense movement of public opinion, that\r\nmovement was actually effected by the actual transference of a\r\ncomparatively small number of votes.\r\n\r\nWhen Parties are thus evenly balanced, to place such a weapon as the\r\nHouse of Lords in the hands of one of the Parties is to doom the other\r\nto destruction. I do not speak only from the Party point of view,\r\nalthough it explains the earnestness with which we approach this\r\nquestion. It is a matter of life and death to Liberalism and\r\nRadicalism. It is a question of our life or the abolition of the veto\r\nof the House of Lords. But look at it from a national point of view.\r\nThink of its injury to the smooth working of a Liberal Government. At\r\nthe present time a Liberal Government, however powerful, cannot look\r\nfar ahead, cannot impart design into its operations, because it knows\r\nthat if at any moment its vigour falls below a certain point another\r\nbody, over which it has no control, is ready to strike it a blow to\r\nits most serious injury.\r\n\r\nIt comes to this, that no matter how great the majority by which a\r\nLiberal Government is supported, it is unable to pass any legislation\r\nunless it can procure the agreement of its political opponents.\r\nObserve the position in which the present Executive Government is\r\nconsequently placed. Take only the question of passive resistance. The\r\naction of the House of Lords at the present time forces the Executive\r\nGovernment to lock up in prison men with whose action they entirely\r\nsympathise and whose grievance they have faithfully promised to\r\nredress. Such a position is intolerable. Indeed, I am sure that if\r\nright hon. gentlemen opposite would only utilise that valuable gift of\r\nputting themselves in imagination in the position of others, they\r\nwould see that no self-respecting men could continue to occupy such a\r\nposition except with the object of putting an end to it for ever.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said for and against the two-Party system. But no one\r\ncan doubt that it adds to the stability and cohesion of the State. The\r\nalternation of Parties in power, like the rotation of crops, has\r\nbeneficial results. Each of the two Parties has services to render in\r\nthe development of the national life; and the succession of new and\r\ndifferent points of view is a real benefit to the country. A choice\r\nbetween responsible Ministries is a great strength to the Crown. The\r\nadvantage of such a system cannot be denied. Would not the ending of\r\nsuch a system involve a much greater disturbance than to amend the\r\nfunctions of the House of Lords? Is there not a much greater cataclysm\r\ninvolved in the breakdown of the constitutional organisation of\r\ndemocracy--for that is the issue which is placed before us--than would\r\nbe involved in the mere curtailment of the legislative veto which has\r\nbeen given to another place?\r\n\r\nI ask the House what does such a safeguard as the House of Lords mean?\r\nIs it a safeguard at all? Enormous powers are already possessed by the\r\nHouse of Commons. It has finance under its control, it has the\r\nExecutive Government; the control of foreign affairs and the great\r\npatronage of the State are all in the power of the House of Commons at\r\nthe present time. And if you are to proceed on the basis that the\r\npeople of this country will elect a mad House of Commons, and that the\r\nmad House of Commons will be represented by a mad Executive, the House\r\nof Lords is no guarantee against any excesses which such a House of\r\nCommons or such an Executive might have in contemplation. Whatever you\r\nmay wish or desire, you will be forced to trust the people in all\r\nthose vital and fundamental elements of government which in every\r\nState have always been held to involve the practical stability of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIs the House of Lords even a security for property? Why, the greatest\r\nweapon which a democracy possesses against property is the power of\r\ntaxation, and the power of taxation is wholly under the control of\r\nthis House. If this House chooses, for instance, to suspend payment to\r\nthe Sinking Fund, and to utilise the money for any public purpose or\r\nfor any social purpose, the House of Lords could not interfere. If the\r\nHouse of Commons chose to double taxation on the wealthy classes, the\r\nHouse of Lords could not interfere in any respect. Understand I am not\r\nadvocating these measures; what I am endeavouring to show to the House\r\nis that there is no real safeguard in the House of Lords even in\r\nregard to a movement against property.\r\n\r\nBut surely there are other securities upon which the stability of\r\nsociety depends. In the ever-increasing complexities of social\r\nproblems, in the restrictions which are imposed from day to day with\r\nincreasing force on the action of individuals, above all, in the\r\ndissemination of property among many classes of the population, lie\r\nthe real elements of stability on which our modern society depends.\r\nThere are to-day, unlike in former ages, actually millions of people\r\nwho possess not merely inert property, but who possess rent-earning,\r\nprofit-bearing property; and the danger with which we are confronted\r\nnow is not at all whether we shall go too fast. No, the danger is that\r\nabout three-fourths of the people of this country should move on in a\r\ncomfortable manner into an easy life, which, with all its ups and\r\ndowns, is not uncheered by fortune, while the remainder of the people\r\nshall be left to rot and fester in the slums of our cities, or wither\r\nin the deserted and abandoned hamlets of our rural districts.\r\n\r\nThat is the danger with which we are confronted at the present moment,\r\nand it invests with a deep and real significance the issue which is\r\ndrawn between the two Parties to-night. It is quite true that there\r\nare rich Members of the Liberal Party, and there are poor men who are\r\nsupporters of the Conservative Party; but in the main the lines of\r\ndifference between the two Parties are social and economic--in the\r\nmain the lines of difference are increasingly becoming the lines of\r\ncleavage between the rich and the poor. Let that reflection be with\r\nus in the struggle which we are now undertaking, and in which we shall\r\nwithout pause press forward, confident of this, that, if we persevere,\r\nwe shall wrest from the hands of privilege and wealth the evil, ugly,\r\nand sinister weapon of the Peers' veto, which they have used so ill so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Lord Robert Cecil.\r\n\r\n[7] Mr. Balfour.\r\n\r\n[8] Mr. Wyndham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUNDEE ELECTION\r\n\r\nKINNAIRD HALL, DUNDEE, _May 14, 1908_\r\n\r\n\r\nA new Government has come into being under a Prime Minister who, like\r\nhis predecessor, is tied to Scotland by strong and intimate bonds.\r\nGive him a fair chance. Give the Government which he has brought into\r\nbeing the opportunity of handling the great machinery of State. Be\r\nassured that, if you do, they will employ it for the greatest good of\r\nthe greatest number. I am well satisfied at what has taken place since\r\nI have been in Dundee. I see a great concentration of forces\r\nthroughout the constituency. I see the opportunity of retrieving, and\r\nmore than retrieving, the injury which has been done to the cause of\r\nprogress and reform by elections in other parts of our island.\r\n\r\nAh, but, a very sad thing has happened; an awful thing has\r\nhappened--the Liberal Party has gone in for Home Rule. _The Scotsman_\r\nis shocked, _The Times_ is speechless, and takes three columns to\r\nexpress its speechlessness; _The Spectator_, that staid old weekly,\r\nhas wobbled back to where it never should have wobbled from; the\r\nUlster Unionists declare that the Government has forfeited all the\r\nconfidence that they never had in it, and thousands of people who\r\nnever under any circumstances voted Liberal before are saying that\r\nunder no circumstances will they ever vote Liberal again. And I am\r\nsupposed to be responsible for this revolution in our policy.\r\n\r\nWhy, the statements I have made on the Irish question are the logical\r\nand inevitable consequence of the Resolution which was passed by the\r\nHouse of Commons, in which every member of the Government voted, which\r\nwas carried by an enormous majority--more than 200--a month ago[9]--a\r\nResolution which, after explaining the plain and lamentable evils\r\nwhich can be traced to the existing system of government in Ireland,\r\naffirmed that the remedy for those evils would be found in a\r\nrepresentative body with an Executive responsible to it, subject to\r\nthe supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Irish question at the present time occupies a vastly different\r\nposition to what it did in the year 1886. Ever since 1880 the\r\nattention of Parliament has been devoted constantly to Ireland, and\r\nthe attention of Parliament, when devoted constantly to one object, is\r\nrarely fruitless. The twenty-five years that have passed have seen\r\ngreat changes in Ireland. We have seen a great scheme of local\r\ngovernment, which Lord Salisbury said would be more disastrous than\r\nHome Rule itself, actually put into force. We have seen the scheme of\r\nland purchase, which in the year 1886 did more to injure the Home Rule\r\nBill than anything else, actually carried, not indeed to a complete\r\nconclusion, but carried into practical effect by a Unionist\r\nAdministration. These are great events; and their consequences, I\r\nthink, ought to encourage us to move forward, and not to move back.\r\nThey have produced results in Ireland which are beneficent, and the\r\nIrish question no longer presents itself in the tragic guise of the\r\nearly eighties. They have produced an effect on Great Britain too. All\r\nover our country people have seen Bills which they were told\r\nbeforehand would be ruinous to the unity and integrity of the United\r\nKingdom--Land Bills and Local Government Bills--passed into law; and\r\nso far from the dire consequences which were apprehended from these\r\nmeasures, they have found--you here have found--that great good has\r\nresulted from that legislation. Many people are encouraged by what has\r\ntaken place to make a step forward in the future; and I think if we\r\nneed to look for any further encouragement, we should find it in the\r\ngreat and undisputed triumph which, under the mercy of Heaven, has\r\nattended our policy in South Africa, and has resulted in bringing into\r\nthe circle of the British Empire a strong and martial race, which\r\nmight easily have been estranged for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Irish polity finds its fellow nowhere in the world. It is a\r\nGovernment responsible neither to King nor people. It is not a\r\ndemocratic Government, nor an autocratic Government, nor even an\r\noligarchical Government. It is a Government hag-ridden by forty-one\r\nadministrative Boards, whose functions overlap one another and\r\nsometimes conflict with one another. Some are fed with money from the\r\nConsolidated Fund, some are supplied by vote of the House of Commons,\r\nsome are supplied from savings from the Irish Development grant. Some\r\nof these Boards are under the Viceroy, some under the Chief Secretary,\r\nsome under Treasury control, and some are under no control at all. The\r\nadministration resulting from that system is costly, inefficient,\r\nunhandy beyond all description: a mighty staff of officials and\r\npolice; a people desperately poor; taxation which rises automatically\r\nwith every increase in the expenditure of this vast and wealthy\r\nisland; and a population which dwindles tragically year by year. Add\r\nto all this a loyalist caste, capable and well-organised, who are\r\ntaught generation after generation to look for support not to their\r\nown countrymen, but to external force derived from across the sea.\r\nThere exists in effect in Ireland at the present time almost exactly\r\nthe same situation which would have grown up in South Africa, if we\r\nhad not had the wit and the nerve to prevent it. Take the whole of\r\nthis situation as I have described it, thrust it into the arena of\r\nBritish politics to be the centre of contending factions, and the\r\npanorama of Irish government is complete.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before us, upon the authority of men like Lord\r\nDunraven, Sir Joseph West-Ridgeway, Sir Antony MacDonnell, Lord\r\nDudley, and others who have served the Crown in Ireland--is it\r\nwonderful that we should refuse to turn our eyes away from the vision\r\nof that other Ireland, free to control her own destiny in all that\r\nproperly concerns herself, free to devote the native genius of her\r\npeople to the purposes of her own self-culture--the vision of that\r\nother Ireland which Mr. Gladstone had reserved as the culminating\r\nachievement of his long and glorious career? Is it wonderful that we\r\nshould refuse to turn our eyes away from that? No; I say that the\r\ndesire and the aim of making a national settlement with Ireland on\r\nlines which would enable the people of that country to manage their\r\nown purely local affairs, is not an aim that can be separated from the\r\ngeneral march of the Liberal army. If I come forward on your platform\r\nhere at Dundee it is on the clear understanding that I do not preclude\r\nmyself from trying to reconcile Ireland to England on a basis of\r\nfreedom and justice.\r\n\r\nI said just now that this was an important election. Yes, the effect\r\nupon his Majesty's Government and upon the Liberal Party for good or\r\nill from this election cannot fail to be far-reaching. There are\r\nstrong forces against us. Do not underrate the growing strength of the\r\nTory reaction now in progress in many of the constituencies in\r\nEngland. I say it earnestly to those who are members of the Labour\r\nParty here to-day--do not underrate the storm which is gathering over\r\nyour heads as well as ours. I am not afraid of the forces which are\r\nagainst us. With your support we shall overwhelm them--with your\r\nsupport we shall bear them down. Ah, but we must have that support.\r\n\r\nIt is not the enemy in front that I fear, but the division which too\r\noften makes itself manifest in progressive ranks--it is that division,\r\nthat dispersion of forces, that internecine struggle in the moments of\r\ngreat emergency, in the moments when the issue hangs in the\r\nbalance--it is that which, I fear, may weaken our efforts and may\r\nperhaps deprive us of success otherwise within our grasp.\r\n\r\nThere are cross-currents in this election. You cannot be unconscious\r\nof that. They flow this way and that way, and they disturb the clear\r\nissue which we should like to establish between the general body of\r\nthose whose desire it is to move forward, and those who wish to revert\r\nto the old and barbarous prejudices and contentions of the past--to\r\nthe fiscal systems and to the methods of government and\r\nadministration, and to the Jingo foreign policies across the seas,\r\nfrom which we hoped we had shaken ourselves clear.\r\n\r\nI want to-night to speak about these cross-currents; and let me first\r\nsay a word about Socialism. There are a great many Socialists whose\r\ncharacters and whose views I have much respect for--men some of whom I\r\nknow well, and whose friendship I enjoy. A good many of those\r\ngentlemen who have delightful, rosy views of a noble and brilliant\r\nfuture for the world, are so remote from hard facts of daily life and\r\nof ordinary politics that I am not very sure that they will bring any\r\nuseful or effective influence to bear upon the immediate course of\r\nevents. To the revolutionary Socialist, whether dreamer or politician,\r\nI do not appeal as the Liberal candidate for Dundee. I recognise that\r\nthey are perfectly right in voting against me and voting against the\r\nLiberals, because Liberalism is not Socialism, and never will be.\r\nThere is a great gulf fixed. It is not only a gulf of method, it is a\r\ngulf of principle. There are many steps we have to take which our\r\nSocialist opponents or friends, whichever they like to call\r\nthemselves, will have to take with us; but there are immense\r\ndifferences of principle and of political philosophy between our views\r\nand their views.\r\n\r\nLiberalism has its own history and its own tradition. Socialism has\r\nits own formulas and aims. Socialism seeks to pull down wealth;\r\nLiberalism seeks to raise up poverty. Socialism would destroy private\r\ninterests; Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way\r\nin which they can be safely and justly preserved, namely, by\r\nreconciling them with public right. Socialism would kill enterprise;\r\nLiberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and\r\npreference. Socialism assails the pre-eminence of the individual;\r\nLiberalism seeks, and shall seek more in the future, to build up a\r\nminimum standard for the mass. Socialism exalts the rule; Liberalism\r\nexalts the man. Socialism attacks capital; Liberalism attacks\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nThese are the great distinctions which I draw, and which, I think, you\r\nwill agree I am right in drawing at this election between our\r\nrespective policies and moods. Don't think that Liberalism is a faith\r\nthat is played out; that it is a creed to which there is no expanding\r\nfuture. As long as the world rolls round, Liberalism will have its\r\npart to play--grand, beneficent, and ameliorating--in relation to men\r\nand States.\r\n\r\nThe truth lies in these matters, as it always lies in difficult\r\nmatters, midway between extreme formulas. It is in the nice adjustment\r\nof the respective ideas of collectivism and individualism that the\r\nproblem of the world and the solution of that problem lie in the years\r\nto come. But I have no hesitation in saying that I am on the side of\r\nthose who think that a greater collective element should be introduced\r\ninto the State and municipalities. I should like to see the State\r\nundertaking new functions, stepping forward into new spheres of\r\nactivity, particularly in services which are in the nature of\r\nmonopolies. There I see a wide field for State enterprise. But when we\r\nare told to exalt and admire a philosophy which destroys individualism\r\nand seeks to replace it absolutely by collectivism, I say that is a\r\nmonstrous and imbecile conception, which can find no real acceptance\r\nin the brains and hearts--and the hearts are as trustworthy as the\r\nbrains--in the hearts of sensible people.\r\n\r\nNow I pass over the revolutionary Socialists, who, I admit, if they\r\nfeel inclined, are justified in throwing away their votes on Saturday\r\nnext, and I come to the Labour and to the Trade Union element in our\r\nmidst. There I have one or two words to say of rather a straight\r\ncharacter, if you don't object, and which, I hope, will be taken in\r\ngood part, and will be studied and examined seriously. Labour in\r\nBritain is not Socialism. It is quite true that the Socialistic\r\nelement has imposed a complexion on Labour, rather against its will,\r\nand is now supported in its action by funds almost entirely supplied\r\nby Trade Unions. But Trade Unions are not Socialistic. They are\r\nundoubtedly individualist organisations, more in the character of the\r\nold Guilds, and lean much more in the direction of the culture of the\r\nindividual than in that of the smooth and bloodless uniformity of the\r\nmass. Now, the Trade Unions are the most respectable and the most\r\npowerful element in the labour world. They are the social bulwarks of\r\nour industrial system. They are the necessary guard-rails of a highly\r\ncompetitive machine, and I have the right, as a member of his\r\nMajesty's Government, to speak with good confidence to Trade\r\nUnionists, because we have done more for Trade Unionists than any\r\nother Government that has ever been.\r\n\r\nHow stands the case of the Trade Unionists? Do they really believe, I\r\nput this question to them fairly--do they really believe that there is\r\nno difference whatever between a Tory and a Liberal Government? Do\r\nTrade Unionists desire the downfall of the existing Liberal\r\nGovernment? Would they really like to send a message of encouragement\r\nto the House of Lords--for that is what it comes to--to reject and\r\nmutilate Liberal and Radical legislation--and Labour legislation now\r\nbefore Parliament? Would they send such a message of encouragement to\r\nthe House of Lords as this--\"House of Lords, you were right in your\r\nestimate of public opinion when you denied the extension of the\r\nProvision of Meals to School Children Bill to Scotland, when you threw\r\nout the Scottish Land Valuation Bill, when you threw out the Scottish\r\nSmall Holders Bill--when you did all this you were right.\" Do you wish\r\nto send that message to the House of Lords? But that will be the\r\nconsequence of every vote subtracted from the Liberal majority.\r\n\r\nWhy, gentlemen, let me return to the general current of events. What\r\nis the Government doing at present, and what has it done in its brief\r\nexistence? Within the limits under which it works, and under the\r\npresent authority of the House of Lords, what has it done and what is\r\nit doing for Trade Unionists? It has passed the Trades Disputes Act.\r\nThe Workmen's Compensation Act has extended the benefits of\r\ncompensation to six million persons not affected by previous\r\nlegislation. The qualification of Justices of the Peace--the citizens'\r\nPrivy Councillorship, as I call it--has been reduced so as to make it\r\nmore easy for persons not possessed of this world's goods to qualify\r\nto take their place on the civic Bench. You know the land legislation\r\nfor England, which is designed to secure that the suitable man who\r\nwants a small parcel of land to cultivate for his own profit and\r\nadvantage shall not be prevented from obtaining it by feudal\r\nlegislation, by old legal formalities or class prejudice. And is the\r\nLicensing Bill not well worth a good blow struck, and struck now,\r\nwhile the iron is hot? Then there is the Miners' Eight Hours Bill, a\r\nmeasure that has been advocated by the miners for twenty years, and\r\njustified by the highest medical testimony on humanitarian and\r\nhygienic grounds. It is costing us votes and supporters. It is\r\ncosting us by-elections, yet it is being driven through. Have we not a\r\nright to claim the support of the Trade Unionists who are associated\r\nwith the miners? Don't they feel that this measure is hanging in the\r\nbalance, not in the House of Commons, but in the balance in the House\r\nof Lords, which attaches to by-elections an importance which, in their\r\narrogant assertion, entitles them to mutilate or reject legislation,\r\neven although it comes to them by the majority of a Parliament newly\r\nelected on a suffrage of six millions. Then there is the question of\r\nold-age pensions, a question that has been much misused and mishandled\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\nThat was a pledge given by our opponents to win the election of 1895,\r\nand after the lapse of thirteen years of toil and stress, the Liberal\r\nParty is able to take it up, and will implement it in an effective\r\nfashion. Now, is there one of all these subjects which does not\r\ncommand the support of Trade Unionists and responsible Labour leaders?\r\nThe Government is fighting for these measures. The Government is\r\nrisking its life and power for these and similar objects. The Tory\r\nParty is opposing it on every point. The Tory Party is gaining\r\npopularity from the resistance of the interests which are affected by\r\nthe passing of such measures of social reform. The House of Lords is\r\nthe weapon of the Tory Party. With that weapon they can make a Liberal\r\nGovernment ridiculous. Are the Labour leaders, are Trade Unionists,\r\nconfronted at this moment with the menace of reaction, deliberately\r\ngoing to throw in their lot with the House of Lords? I don't think\r\nthey will. The record in Labour legislation under the existence of the\r\npresent Government is a record which deserves, and will, I believe,\r\ncommand, the support of the great mass of the labouring classes of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut I say, in all seriousness, that if the Liberal Government is on\r\nthe one hand confronted by the House of Lords, fortified by sporadic\r\nby-elections, and on the other hand is attacked, abused, derided, by a\r\nsection of those for whom it is fighting, then that Government,\r\nwhatever its hopes, whatever its energies, whatever its strength, will\r\nbe weakened, will perhaps succumb, and will be replaced by another\r\nGovernment. And by what other Government will it be replaced? There\r\ncan be no other result from such a division of progressive forces than\r\nto instal a Tory and Protectionist Government in power. That will not\r\nbe fatal to us. Liberalism will not be killed. Liberalism is a\r\nquickening spirit--it is immortal. It will live on through all the\r\ndays, be they good days or be they evil days. No! I believe it will\r\neven burn stronger and brighter and more helpful in evil days than in\r\ngood--just like your harbour-lights, which shine out across the sea,\r\nand which on a calm night gleam with soft refulgence, but through the\r\nstorm flash a message of life to those who toil on the rough waters.\r\n\r\nBut it takes a great party to govern Great Britain--no clique, no\r\nfaction, no cabal, can govern the forty millions of people who live in\r\nthis island. It takes a vast concentration of forces to make a\r\ngoverning instrument. You have now got a Radical and democratic\r\ngoverning instrument, and if this Administration is broken, that\r\ninstrument will be shattered. It has been recreated painfully and\r\nlaboriously after twenty years by courage and fidelity. It has come\r\ninto being--it is here. It is now at work, and by legislation and by\r\nthe influence which it can exercise throughout the whole world, it is\r\nmaking even our opponents talk our language, making all parties in the\r\nState think of social reform, and concern themselves with social and\r\ndomestic affairs. Beware how you injure that great instrument, as Mr.\r\nGladstone called it--or weaken it at a moment when the masses of this\r\ncountry have need of it. Why, what would happen, if this present\r\nGovernment were to perish? On its tomb would be written: \"Beware of\r\nsocial reform. The labouring classes will not support a Government\r\nengaged in social reform. Every social reform will cost you votes.\r\nBeware of social reform. 'Learn to think Imperially.'\"\r\n\r\nAn inconclusive verdict from Dundee, the home of Scottish\r\nRadicalism--an inconclusive, or, still more, a disastrous\r\nverdict--would carry a message of despair to every one in all parts of\r\nour island and in our sister island who is working for the essential\r\ninfluences and truths of Liberalism and progress. Down, down, down\r\nwould fall the high hopes of the social reformer. The constructive\r\nplans now forming in so many brains would melt into air. The old\r\nregime would be reinstated, reinstalled. Like the Bourbons, they will\r\nhave learned nothing and will have forgotten nothing. We shall step\r\nout of the period of adventurous hope in which we have lived for a\r\nbrief spell; we shall step back to the period of obstinate and\r\nprejudiced negations. For Ireland--ten years of resolute government;\r\nfor England--dear food and cheaper gin; and for Scotland--the superior\r\nwisdom of the House of Lords! Is that the work you want to do, men of\r\nDundee? Is that the work to which you will put your precious\r\nfranchises--your votes, which have been won for you by so much\r\nstruggle in the past? No; I am confident that this city, which has of\r\nits own free will plunged into the very centre of national politics,\r\nwill grasp the opportunity now presented; that its command will not be\r\nback, but forward; that its counsel will be not timidity, but courage,\r\nand that it will aim not at dividing, but at rallying the progressive\r\nforces, not at dissipating, but at combining the energies of reform.\r\nThat will be the message which you will send in tones which no man can\r\nmistake--so that a keen, strong, northern air shall sweep across our\r\nland to nerve and brace the hearts of men, to encourage the weak, to\r\nfortify the strong, to uplift the generous, to correct the proud.\r\n\r\nIn time of war, when an action has been joined for a long time, and\r\nthe lines are locked in fierce conflict, and stragglers are coming in\r\nand the wounded drifting away, when the reserves begin to waver here\r\nand there, it is on such an occasion that Scottish regiments have so\r\noften won distinction; it is on these occasions that you have seen\r\nsome valiant brigade march straight forward into the battle smoke,\r\ninto the confusion of the field, right into the heart of the fight.\r\nThat is what you have to do at this moment. \"Scotland for ever!\"\r\n\r\nNow I turn my argument to the other side of the field, to the other\r\nquarter, from which we are subject to attack; I turn in my appeal from\r\nTrade Unionists, from the Labour men, who ought in all fairness to\r\nrecognise the work this Government is doing and back them in their\r\nsore struggle; I turn to the rich and the powerful, to Unionist and\r\nConservative elements, who, nevertheless, upon Free Trade, upon\r\ntemperance, and upon other questions of moral enlightenment, feel a\r\nconsiderable sympathy with the Liberal Party; I turn to those who say,\r\n\"We like Free Trade and we are Liberals at heart, but this Government\r\nis too Radical: we don't like its Radical measures. Why can't they let\r\nwell alone? What do they mean by introducing all these measures, all\r\nthese Bills, which,\" so they say, \"disturb credit and trade, and\r\ninterfere with the course of business, and cause so many\r\nclass-struggles in the country?\" I turn to those who complain we are\r\ntoo Radical in this and in that, and that we are moving too quickly,\r\nand I say to them: \"Look at this political situation, not as party\r\nmen, but as Britons; look at it in the light of history; look at it in\r\nthe light of philosophy; and look at it in the light of broad-minded,\r\nChristian charity.\"\r\n\r\nWhy is it that life and property are more secure in Britain than in\r\nany other country in the world? Why is it that our credit is so high\r\nand that our commerce stretches so far? Is it because of the\r\nrepressive laws which we impose? Why, gentlemen, there are laws far\r\nmore severe than any prevailing in this country, or that have\r\nprevailed here for many years, now in force in great States in Europe,\r\nand yet there is no complete security of life and property\r\nnotwithstanding all these repressive laws. Is it because of the House\r\nof Lords, that life and property are secure? Why, orders of\r\naristocracy more powerful, much more homogeneous, of greater\r\nprivileges, acting with much greater energy than our aristocracy, have\r\nbeen swept away in other countries until not a vestige, or scarce a\r\nvestige, of their existence remains. Is it because of the British\r\nConstitution that life and property are secure? Why, the British\r\nConstitution is mainly British common sense. There never were forty\r\nmillions of people dwelling together who had less of an arbitrary and\r\nrigid Constitution than we have here. The Constitution of France, the\r\nConstitution of Germany, the Constitution of the United States are far\r\nmore rigid, far better fortified against popular movement, than the\r\nConstitution under which we in these islands have moved steadily\r\nforward abreast of the centuries on the whole to a better state than\r\nany other country.\r\n\r\nI will tell those wealthy and powerful people what the secret of the\r\nsecurity of life and property in Britain is. The security arises from\r\nthe continuation of that very class-struggle which they lament and of\r\nwhich they complain, which goes on ceaselessly in our country, which\r\ngoes on tirelessly, with perpetual friction, a struggle between class\r\nand class which never sinks into lethargy, and never breaks into\r\nviolence, but which from year to year makes possible a steady and\r\nconstant advance. It is on the nature of that class-struggle in\r\nBritain that the security of life and property is fundamentally\r\nreposed. We are always changing; like nature, we change a great deal,\r\nalthough we change very slowly. We are always reaching a higher level\r\nafter each change, but yet with the harmony of our life unbroken and\r\nunimpaired. And I say also to those persons here, to whom I now make\r\nmy appeal: wealthy men, men of light and leading have never been all\r\non one side in our country. There have always been men of power and\r\nposition who have sacrificed and exerted themselves in the popular\r\ncause; and that is why there is so little class-hatred here, in spite\r\nof all the squalor and misery which we see around us. There,\r\ngentlemen, lies the true evolution of democracy. That is how we have\r\npreserved the golden thread of historical continuity, when so many\r\nother nations have lost it for ever. That is the only way in which\r\nyour island life as you know it, and love it, can be preserved in all\r\nits grace and in all its freedom--can be elevated, expanded, and\r\nillumined for those who will occupy our places when our share in the\r\nworld's work is done.\r\n\r\nAnd I appeal to the leaders of industry and of learning in this city\r\nto range themselves on the side of a policy which will vigilantly seek\r\nthe welfare of the masses, and which will strictly refuse to profit\r\nthrough their detriment; and, in spite of the violence of extremists,\r\nin spite of the harshness of controversy which hard conditions\r\nproduce, in spite of many forces which may seem to those gentlemen\r\nungrateful, I ask them to pursue and persevere in their crusade--for\r\nit is a crusade--of social progress and advance.\r\n\r\nCologne Cathedral took 600 years to build. Generations of architects\r\nand builders lived and died while the work was in progress. Still the\r\nwork went on. Sometimes a generation built wrongly, and the next\r\ngeneration had to unbuild, and the next generation had to build again.\r\nStill the work went on through all the centuries, till at last there\r\nstood forth to the world a mighty monument of beauty and of truth to\r\ncommand the admiration and inspire the reverence of mankind. So let it\r\nbe with the British Commonwealth. Let us build wisely, let us build\r\nsurely, let us build faithfully, let us build, not for the moment, but\r\nfor future years, seeking to establish here below what we hope to\r\nfind above--a house of many mansions, where there shall be room for\r\nall.\r\n\r\n    The result of the election was declared as follows\r\n\r\n        Churchill (Liberal)                     7,079\r\n        Baxter (Conservative)                   4,370\r\n        Stuart (Socialist)                      4,014\r\n        Scrymgeour (Prohibitionist)               655\r\n                                                -----\r\n          Liberal majority                      2,709\r\n                                                -----\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] March 30, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSOCIAL ORGANISATION\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\nMINES [EIGHT HOURS] BILL (July 6, 1908)                  173\r\n\r\nUNEMPLOYMENT (Oct. 10, 1908)                             189\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL FIELD (Jan. 13, 1909)                         211\r\n\r\nTHE APPROACHING CONFLICT (Jan. 30, 1909)                 225\r\n\r\nTHE ANTI-SWEATING BILL (April 28, 1909)                  239\r\n\r\nLABOUR EXCHANGES AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\r\n  (May 19, 1909)                                         253\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND READING OF THE MINES [EIGHT HOURS] BILL\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _July 6, 1908_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever arguments may be urged against this measure, no one can say\r\nthat the Government have acted with precipitation in bringing it\r\nbefore the House and the country. It has been debated for twenty\r\nyears. Parliaments, Tory and Liberal, have affirmed the principle, and\r\nI do not suppose there ever was a similar reform put forward in this\r\nHouse upon a greater volume of scientific and accurate information, or\r\nafter more prolonged, careful, and sustained scrutiny. If the debate\r\non the Second Reading has thrown very little new light on this\r\nquestion, it is because it has been fully and thoroughly explored on\r\nformer occasions; and not only has it been fully explored, but it is\r\nnow illuminated by the admirable Report which has been presented by\r\nthe Departmental Committee appointed last session.\r\n\r\nThis Report, while exciting approval on all sides, gives no complete\r\nsatisfaction to any. It balances, and weighs, but it does not finally\r\npronounce. It aims less at deciding this controversy, than at defining\r\nthe limits within which its economic aspect may be said to lie. I\r\nthink any one who reads the Report with attention will feel, after\r\ncareful study, that the limits of the economic controversy are\r\nmoderately restricted. We have to consider on the one hand the gross\r\nreduction of one-tenth in the hours of labour of underground workmen,\r\ntaking the average over all classes of men and all sorts of mines. And\r\non the other hand we have as a set-off against that gross reduction\r\ncertain very important mitigations which are enumerated in the Report,\r\nto which I shall briefly refer.\r\n\r\nThe first economic question which the House has to settle is, whether\r\nthese mitigations which are enumerated will have the effect of\r\novertaking the reduction which is to follow the curtailment of hours,\r\nor, if not, how far they will fall short in overtaking that reduction.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that any hon. gentleman is likely to change his\r\nopinion on a question of such complexity at this late stage of the\r\ndebate, and therefore I shall only refer by name to these mitigations,\r\nbearing in mind how important they are. There are those which depend\r\non the arrangements of employers, and those which depend on the\r\nvolition of the workers. With regard to the employers, there is\r\nimproved organisation by methods of haulage and winding, and other\r\nmeans specified in the Report. There is the more extensive application\r\nof coal-cutting machinery, and the sinking of new pits with modern\r\nappliances, which is progressing in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThere is the system of double and multiple shifts. The extension of\r\nthe system will not be so difficult as has sometimes been supposed. At\r\nthe present moment, taking the statistics of 1906, a quarter only of\r\nthe workers below ground are employed in mines in which there is only\r\none coal-getting shift, and in all the mines in which there are two or\r\nmore coal-getting shifts the first shift preponderates in number\r\ngreatly over the second, and, therefore, in applying this system of\r\ndouble or multiple shifts, in so far as it is necessary to apply it,\r\nwe shall not have to face the difficulty of a complete transformation\r\nin the methods of working a great many of the mines, but it will be a\r\nmere extension of the system which at present exists over a great\r\nportion of the coal-getting area.\r\n\r\nFrom the side of labour, the mitigations which may be expected as\r\noff-sets to the original reduction are not less important. There is\r\nthe increased efficiency, of which we have instances actually on\r\nrecord in this Report, which has followed from the reduction of hours.\r\nThere is the power of the worker, if he chooses, to increase his\r\nearnings on a short day. There is \"absenteeism,\" which has always been\r\naffected by a reduction of hours, and which amounts to 6.6 per cent.\r\nof the working time of the mines, and there is the margin of stoppages\r\nthrough slack trade and other circumstances, which at present\r\naggregates 7 per cent. of the working time of the mines. Taking these\r\nlast two alone, they aggregate 13 per cent., or considerably more, as\r\na margin, than the reduction of working time which will be caused by\r\nthe operation of this Bill, even when the full operation is reached.\r\n\r\nFirst of all then, let the House consider carefully whether from these\r\nsources it is possible to overtake the 10 per cent. reduction which,\r\nin the first instance, the Bill imposes. It is a question nicely\r\nbalanced; it offers matter for fair argument this way and that, but,\r\ntaking all the means of mitigation together, not only singly but\r\ncollectively, it is surely very difficult to believe that masters and\r\nmen, organised as they are, and working together with good will, and\r\nwith ample time to accommodate themselves to new arrangements, will\r\nnot be able from all sources to overtake the comparatively small\r\nreduction in hours the Bill will effect.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to an opinion that good use will be made of these\r\nmargins, but even if we assume, for the sake of the argument, that\r\nthere will be a net reduction in consequence of the passage of this\r\nBill in the output of coal, that reduction must be temporary and\r\ntransient in its character. For fifty years there have been continuous\r\nchanges in the conditions of coal-mining in this country. The hours\r\nhave been reduced, the conditions of boy labour have been restricted,\r\nwages have been raised, compensation has been provided, and\r\nprecautions against accidents have been multiplied. All these changes,\r\nthe wisdom of which nobody disputes, may from a purely and crudely\r\neconomic standpoint be said to militate against production. We have\r\nheard many prophecies, but what has been the history of the coal\r\ntrade? There has been a steady, unbroken expansion of output during\r\nthe last fifty years. In the period of ten years ending in 1874,\r\n76,000,000 tons were produced; in the next ten years 112,000,000; in\r\nthe next ten years 145,000,000; in the next ten years 172,000,000; and\r\nin the last period of ten years 214,000,000--a figure which has been\r\ngreatly exceeded since.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that there may be a certain reduction in output as a\r\nconsequence of this Bill, that reduction must be considered, not by\r\nitself, not in isolation, but in relation to the steady and persistent\r\nmovement of coal production for the last fifty years. To me it seems\r\ncertain that the small temporary restriction will be lost in the\r\ngeneral tendency to expansion, as the eddy is carried forward by the\r\nstream and the recoiling wave is lost in the advancing tide.\r\n\r\nBut these arguments would be wholly vitiated if it could be shown that\r\nthe restriction of hours was so violent in its character, so sudden in\r\nits application, so rigid in its methods as, not merely to cause a\r\ncertain shrinkage in the volume of the output, but to upset the\r\neconomy of the coal-mining industry. In that case there would be not\r\nmerely a curtailment which might be mitigated, but we should have\r\ninjured and possibly disorganised the industry; and it is at this\r\npoint that it is proper for the House to consider the safeguards\r\nintroduced by the Government into the Bill. These safeguards are of\r\nthe greatest importance.\r\n\r\nThere is the safeguard of overtime. Sixty hours a year are permitted.\r\nIn districts where men work ten days a fortnight, twelve weeks may be\r\none hour longer than the usual time allowed by the Bill; and where the\r\ndays laboured are only four in the week, fifteen weeks of extended\r\ntime will be possible through the provision of overtime. There are\r\nprovisions with regard to the labour of certain persons permitted to\r\nremain below ground beyond the legal hours for special purposes, and\r\nthere is a power which relaxes the Bill altogether in an emergency\r\nwhich is likely to delay or arrest the general work of the mine, and,\r\nof course, in any case where there is accident or danger. Finally, if\r\nthere should be risk of a corner or an unexpected rise in price, the\r\nGovernment have power by Order in Council to suspend the whole\r\noperation of the law in order to prevent anything like a serious\r\ncrisis arising in the coal trade.\r\n\r\nI cannot bring myself to believe that with all these safeguards it\r\nwill not be possible for the coal industry, if given time, to\r\naccommodate itself to the new conditions. It is only two years ago\r\nthat I was invited from the benches opposite to contemplate the\r\napproaching ruin of the gold mines of the Rand through the change\r\nintroduced in the methods of working. That change has been enforced,\r\nwith the result that working expenses have been reduced, and the\r\nstandard of production has increased. In making that transition, if\r\ntime had not been allowed to tide over the period of change, then,\r\nindeed, you might have had that disaster which hon. gentlemen opposite\r\nhave always been ready to apprehend. But there is here to be a gradual\r\nprocess of adaptation, for which not less than five years is\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nWe are told that positive reasons, and not negative reasons, ought to\r\nbe given in support of a measure which regulates the hours of adult\r\nlabour--that you ought to show, not that it will do no harm, but that\r\ngood will come from it. There are, of course, such reasons in support\r\nof this Bill, but they are so obvious that they have not been dwelt\r\nupon as much as they might have been. The reasons are social reasons.\r\nWe believe that the well-being of the mining population, numbering\r\nsome 900,000 persons, will be sensibly advanced in respect of health,\r\nindustrial efficiency, habits of temperance, education, culture, and\r\nthe general standard of life. We have seen that in the past the\r\nshortening of hours has produced beneficial effects in these respects,\r\nand we notice that in those parts of the country where the hours of\r\ncoal-mining are shortest, the University Extension lecturers find that\r\nthe miners take an intelligent interest in their lectures--and it is\r\namong the miners of Fifeshire that a considerable development in\r\ngardening and also of saving to enable them to own their own houses,\r\nhas followed on a longer period of leisure.\r\n\r\nBut the general march of industrial democracy is not towards\r\ninadequate hours of work, but towards sufficient hours of leisure.\r\nThat is the movement among the working people all over the country.\r\nThey are not content that their lives should remain mere alternations\r\nbetween bed and the factory. They demand time to look about them, time\r\nto see their homes by daylight, to see their children, time to think\r\nand read and cultivate their gardens--time, in short, to live. That is\r\nvery strange, perhaps, but that is the request they have made and are\r\nmaking with increasing force and reason as years pass by.\r\n\r\nNo one is to be pitied for having to work hard, for nature has\r\ncontrived a special reward for the man who works hard. It gives him an\r\nextra relish, which enables him to gather in a brief space from simple\r\npleasures a satisfaction in search of which the social idler wanders\r\nvainly through the twenty-four hours. But this reward, so precious in\r\nitself, is snatched away from the man who has won it, if the hours of\r\nhis labour are too long or the conditions of his labour too severe to\r\nleave any time for him to enjoy what he has won.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marshall, in his \"Principles of Economics,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"The influence which the standard of hours of work exerts on economic\r\nactivities is partially obscured by the fact that the earnings of a\r\nhuman being are commonly counted gross; no special reckoning being\r\nmade for his wear-and-tear, of which he is himself rather careless.\r\nFurther, very little account is taken of the evil effects of the\r\noverwork of men on the well-being of the next generation.... When the\r\nhours and the general conditions of labour are such as to cause great\r\nwear-and-tear of body or mind or both, and to lead to a low standard\r\nof living; when there has been a want of that leisure, rest, and\r\nrepose which are among the necessaries for efficiency, then the labour\r\nhas been extravagant from the point of view of society at large....\r\nAnd, since material wealth exists for the sake of man, and not man for\r\nthe sake of material wealth, the replacement of inefficient and\r\nstunted human lives by more efficient and fuller lives would be a gain\r\nof a higher order than any temporary material loss that might have\r\nbeen occasioned on the way.\"\r\n\r\nIf it be said that these arguments are general, is it not true that\r\nspecial circumstances differentiate the case of coal-miners from that\r\nof many other industries in this country? Others have spoken of the\r\nheat of the mine, the danger of fire-damp, of the cramped position, of\r\nthe muscular exertions of the miner, at work in moist galleries\r\nperhaps a mile under the ground. I select the single fact of\r\ndeprivation of natural light. That alone is enough to justify\r\nParliament in directing upon the industry of coal-mining a specially\r\nsevere scrutiny and introducing regulations of a different character\r\nfrom those elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Windsor[10] who moved the rejection of this Bill\r\ndescribed it as a reckless and foolhardy experiment. I see the miner\r\nemerging from the pit after eight hours' work with the assertion on\r\nhis lips that he, at any rate, has paid his daily debt to his fellow\r\nmen. Is the House of Commons now going to say to him, \"You have no\r\nright to be here. You have only worked eight hours. Your appearance on\r\nthe surface of the earth after eight hours' work is, to quote the hon.\r\nMember, 'a reckless and foolhardy experiment'\"? I do not wonder at the\r\nminers' demand. I cannot find it in my heart to feel the slightest\r\nsurprise, or indignation, or mental disturbance at it. My capacity for\r\nwonder is entirely absorbed, not by the miners' demand, but by the\r\ngentleman in the silk hat and white waistcoat who has the composure\r\nand the complacency to deny that demand and dispute it with him.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Dulwich[11]--himself a convinced protectionist,\r\nwith a tariff with 1,200 articles in its schedules in his coat-tail\r\npocket--has given us a delightful lecture on the importance of\r\ncheapness of production. Think of the poor consumer! Think of the\r\nimportance to our industries of cheapness of production! We on this\r\nside are great admirers of cheapness of production. We have reminded\r\nthe hon. gentleman of it often; but why should cheapness of production\r\nalways be achieved at the expense of the human factor? The hon.\r\ngentleman spoke with anxiety of the possibility of a rise in miners'\r\nwages as a consequence of this Bill. Has he considered the relation of\r\nminers' wages to the selling prices of coal? At the pit's mouth the\r\nunderground-workers' wages are only 60 per cent. of the selling price\r\nof coal. Free on board on the Tyne, the proportion is only 38 per\r\ncent. As coal is sold here in the south of England the proportion of\r\nwages is less than one-fifth of the whole price. Is it not clear that\r\nthere are other factors at least which require consideration before\r\nyou decide to deal with the human factor, which first attracts the\r\nattention of the hon. gentleman?\r\n\r\nWhat about mining royalties? In all this talk about the importance of\r\ncheap coal to our industries and to the poor consumer we have had no\r\nmention of mining royalties. No. We never mention that. Yet, will the\r\nHouse believe it, it is estimated that mining royalties impose a toll\r\nof 6 per cent., calculated on the price of coal at the pit's mouth, or\r\nconsiderably more than half the total diminished production which\r\ncould result from this humane Act of labour legislation.\r\n\r\nBut we are asked: \"Why stop here? Why don't your arguments apply\r\nelsewhere?\" and we are told of people whose conditions of life are\r\nworse than some of those of coal-miners. Why stop here? Who ever said\r\nwe would stop here? I welcome and support this measure, not only for\r\nits own sake, but much more because it is, I believe, simply the\r\nprecursor of the general movement which is in progress all over the\r\nworld, and in other industries besides this, towards reconciling the\r\nconditions of labour with the well-ascertained laws of science and\r\nhealth. If we are told that because we support this measure we shall\r\nbe inflicting an injury or injustice on other classes of the\r\npopulation, I say there is a great solidarity among all classes of\r\nmanual labourers. I believe that when they consider this matter they\r\nwill see that all legitimate interests are in harmony, that no one\r\nclass can obtain permanent advantage by undue strain on another, and\r\nthat in the end their turn will come for shorter hours, and will come\r\nthe sooner because they have aided others to obtain that which they\r\ndesire themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the House is asked to contemplate gloomy pictures of what will\r\nfollow on this Bill, let them recur to the example of Parliaments gone\r\nby. When the Ten Hours Bill was introduced in 1847, a Bill which\r\naffected the hours of adult males inferentially, the same lugubrious\r\nprophecies were indulged in from both sides of the House.\r\nDistinguished economists came forward to prove that the whole profit\r\nof the textile industry was reaped after the eleventh hour. Famous\r\nstatesmen on both sides spoke strongly against the measure. The\r\nParliament, in 1847, was in the same sort of position as we are to-day\r\nin this respect, but how differently circumstanced in other respects.\r\nThat Parliament did not enjoy the wide and accurate statistical\r\ninformation in every branch of labour which enables us to-day to move\r\nforward with discretion and prudence. They were not able to look to\r\nthe general evidences of commercial security and expansion on which\r\nmodern politicians can rely. They could not show, as we can show,\r\noverwhelming examples of owlish prophets dazzlingly disproved; they\r\ncould not point, as we can point, to scores of cases where not only\r\nincreased efficiency, but a positive increase in output has followed\r\nthe reduction of the hours of labour. The principle was new, the\r\nfuture was vague. But the Parliament of those days did not quail. They\r\ntrusted to broad, generous instincts of common sense; they drew a\r\ngood, bold line; and we to-day enjoy in a more gentle, more humane,\r\nmore skilful, more sober, and more civilised population the blessings\r\nwhich have followed their acts. Now it is our turn. Let us vote for\r\nthe Second Reading of this Bill, and in so doing establish a claim\r\nupon the respect of Parliaments to come, such as we ourselves owe to\r\nParliaments of the past.[12]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Mr. J.F. Mason.\r\n\r\n[11] Mr. Bonar Law.\r\n\r\n[12] This concluded the debate, and the Second Reading was carried by\r\n390 to 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\nKINNAIRD HALL, DUNDEE, _October 10, 1908_\r\n\r\n(From _The Times_, by permission.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the political situation which unfolds itself to our\r\nreflections to-night? I present it to you without misgivings or\r\nreserve. For nearly three years a Liberal Administration, more\r\ndemocratic in its character, more widely selected in its _personnel_,\r\nmore Radical in the general complexion of its policy, than any that\r\nhas previously been known to British history, has occupied the place\r\nof power. During the whole of that period no single serious\r\nadministrative mistake, either at home or abroad, has embarrassed or\r\ndiscredited the conduct of public affairs. Three Parliamentary\r\nSessions, fruitful beyond precedent in important legislation, have\r\nbeen surmounted with dignity and dispatch. The authority and influence\r\nof Great Britain among foreign Powers have been prudently guarded, and\r\nare now appreciably augmented, and that authority and influence have\r\nbeen consistently employed, and will be in the future employed, in\r\nsoothing international rivalries and suspicion, in asserting a proper\r\nrespect for public law, in preserving a just and harmonious balance\r\namongst great Powers, and in forwarding as opportunities have served,\r\nwhether in the Near East or in the Congo, causes of a generous and\r\ndisinterested humanitarianism.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire itself has enjoyed under Liberal rule a period of\r\nprosperous tranquillity, favourable both to development and\r\nconsolidation; and it is no exaggeration to say that it was never more\r\nstrong or more peacefully united than at the present moment. The\r\nconfidence which the whole country, irrespective of party, feels in\r\nSir Edward Grey in the present European crisis, is the measure of our\r\nsuccess in foreign affairs. The gathering of the Convention of a\r\nUnited South Africa is in itself a vindication of colonial policy.\r\nEach year for which we have been responsible has been marked by some\r\ngreat and beneficent event which has commanded the acquiescence--or at\r\nleast silenced the dissent--of many of our professed opponents. In\r\n1906 the charter of trade unions; in 1907, the conciliation and\r\nsettlement of South Africa; in 1908, the establishment of old-age\r\npensions. These are large matters; they will take their place in the\r\nhistory book; and on them alone, if necessary, I would confidently\r\nbase the claims of his Majesty's Government to respect, if not to\r\nrenown, in future times.\r\n\r\nBut although we do not meet to-night in any atmosphere of crisis, nor\r\nin any expectation of a general election, nevertheless I feel, and I\r\ndare say you feel too, that we have reached a climacteric in the life\r\nof this Parliament. The next six months will probably determine the\r\nwhole remaining fortunes of the Government, and decide whether a\r\ngradual but progressive decline will slowly carry the Administration\r\nin the natural course to the grave where so many others are peacefully\r\nslumbering, or whether, deriving fresh vigour from its exertions, it\r\nwill march forward conquering and to conquer.\r\n\r\nI said a few minutes ago that this session had been marked by a\r\nmeasure of great and cardinal importance. Surely no one will deny the\r\nmagnitude and significance of the step which has been taken in the\r\nestablishment of a system of old-age pensions. It marks the assertion\r\nin our social system of an entirely new principle in regard to\r\npoverty, and that principle, once asserted, cannot possibly be\r\nconfined within its existing limits. Old-age pensions will carry us\r\nall a very long way. They have opened a door which will not soon or\r\neasily be closed. The members of both Houses of Parliament have been\r\nled to the verge of the cruel abyss of poverty, and have been in\r\nsolemn session assembled to contemplate its depths and its gloom. All\r\nalike have come to gaze; none have remained unmoved. There are some\r\ndistinguished and eminent men, men whose power and experience I cannot\r\nimpugn, who have started back appalled by what they have seen, and\r\nwhose only idea is to slam the door on the grim and painful prospect\r\nwhich has been revealed to their eyes.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the only spirit which has been awakened in our\r\ncountry; there are others, not less powerful, and a greater number,\r\nwho will never allow that door to be closed; they have got their feet\r\nin it, they are resolved that it shall be kept open. Nay, more, they\r\nare prepared to descend into the abyss, and grapple with its evils--as\r\nsometimes you see after an explosion at a coal mine a rescue party\r\nadvancing undaunted into the smoke and steam. Now there is the issue\r\non which the future of this Parliament hangs--\"Forward or back?\"\r\nVoices sound loud and conflicting in our ears; the issue, the sharpest\r\nand simplest, the most tremendous that can be put to a generation of\r\nmen--\"Forward or backward?\"--is the issue which confronts us at the\r\npresent time, and on it the future of the Government is staked. There\r\nare faint-hearted friends behind; there are loud-voiced foes in front.\r\nThe brewer's dray has been pulled across the road, and behind it are\r\nembattled a formidable confederation of vested interests. A\r\nmountainous obstacle of indifference and apathy bars our advance. What\r\nis your counsel? Forward or Back?\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that aged poverty is not the only evil with\r\nwhich, so far as our means allow, we have to grapple. What is the\r\nproblem of the hour? It can be comprised in one word--Unemployment.\r\nAfter two years of unexampled trade expansion, we have entered upon a\r\nperiod of decline. We are not alone in this. A reaction from\r\novertrading is general all over the world. Both Germany and the United\r\nStates are suffering from a similar commercial contraction, and in\r\nboth countries, in spite of their high and elaborate protective\r\ntariffs, a trade set-back has been accompanied by severe industrial\r\ndislocation and unemployment. In the United States of America,\r\nparticularly, I am informed that unemployment has recently been more\r\ngeneral than in this country. Indeed the financial collapse in the\r\nUnited States last autumn has been the most clearly marked of all the\r\ncauses to which the present trade depression may be assigned.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet possible to say that the end of that period of\r\ndepression is in sight; but there are some significant indications\r\nwhich I think justify the hope that it will be less severe and less\r\nprolonged than has been known in other trade cycles, or than some\r\npeople were at first inclined to believe. But the problem of\r\nunemployment is not confined to periods of trade depression, and will\r\nnot be solved by trade revival; and it is to that problem in its\r\nlarger and more permanent aspects that I desire to draw your attention\r\nfor a short time to-night.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that the population of Great Britain has\r\nincreased beyond the means of subsistence. On the contrary, our wealth\r\nis increasing faster than our numbers. Production is active; industry\r\ngrows, and grows with astonishing vigour and rapidity. Enterprise in\r\nthis country requires no artificial stimulant; if it errs at all, it\r\nis from time to time upon the side of overtrading and overproduction.\r\nThere is no ground for believing that this country is not capable of\r\nsupporting an increasing population in a condition of expanding\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that the British people are more than\r\nany other people in the world a manufacturing people. It is certain\r\nthat our population could never have attained its present vast\r\nnumbers, nor our country have achieved its position in the world,\r\nwithout an altogether unusual reliance upon manufacture as opposed to\r\nsimple agriculture. The ordinary changes and transitions inseparable\r\nfrom the active life and growth of modern industry, therefore, operate\r\nhere with greater relative intensity than in other countries. An\r\nindustrial disturbance is more serious in Great Britain than in other\r\ncountries, for it affects a far larger proportion of the people, and\r\nin their distresses the urban democracy are not sustained by the same\r\nsolid backing of country-folk and peasant cultivators that we see in\r\nother lands. It has, therefore, become a paramount necessity for us to\r\nmake scientific provision against the fluctuations and set-backs\r\nwhich are inevitable in world commerce and in national industry.\r\n\r\nWe have lately seen how the backwash of an American monetary\r\ndisturbance or a crisis in the Near East or in the Far East, or some\r\nother cause influencing world trade, and as independent of our control\r\nas are the phases of the moon, may easily have the effect of letting\r\nloose upon thousands of humble families and households all the horrors\r\nof a state of siege or a warlike blockade. Then there are strikes and\r\ntrade disputes of all kinds which affect vast numbers of people\r\naltogether unconcerned in the quarrel. Now, I am not going to-night to\r\nproclaim the principle of the \"right to work.\" There is not much use\r\nin proclaiming a right apart from its enforcement; and when it is\r\nenforced there is no need to proclaim it. But what I am here to\r\nassert, and to assert most emphatically, is the responsibility of\r\nGovernment towards honest and law-abiding citizens; and I am surprised\r\nthat that responsibility should ever be challenged or denied.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a famine in India, when owing to some unusual course of\r\nnature the sky refuses its rains and the earth its fruits, relief\r\nworks are provided in the provinces affected, trains of provisions are\r\npoured in from all parts of that great Empire, aid and assistance are\r\ngiven to the population involved, not merely to enable them to survive\r\nthe period of famine, but to resume their occupations at its close. An\r\nindustrial disturbance in the manufacturing districts and the great\r\ncities of this country presents itself to the ordinary artisan in\r\nexactly the same way as the failure of crops in a large province in\r\nIndia presents itself to the Hindu cultivator. The means by which he\r\nlives are suddenly removed, and ruin in a form more or less swift and\r\nterrible stares him instantly in the face. That is a contingency which\r\nseems to fall within the most primary and fundamental obligations of\r\nany organisation of Government. I do not know whether in all countries\r\nor in all ages that responsibility could be maintained, but I do say\r\nthat here and now in this wealthy country and in this scientific age\r\nit does in my opinion exist, is not discharged, ought to be\r\ndischarged, and will have to be discharged.\r\n\r\nThe social machinery at the basis of our industrial life is deficient,\r\nill-organised, and incomplete. While large numbers of persons enjoy\r\ngreat wealth, while the mass of the artisan classes are abreast of and\r\nin advance of their fellows in other lands, there is a minority,\r\nconsiderable in numbers, whose condition is a disgrace to a scientific\r\nand professedly Christian civilisation, and constitutes a grave and\r\nincreasing peril to the State. Yes, in this famous land of ours, so\r\noften envied by foreigners, where the grace and ease of life have been\r\ncarried to such perfection, where there is so little class hatred and\r\njealousy, where there is such a wide store of political experience and\r\nknowledge, where there are such enormous moral forces available, so\r\nmuch wisdom, so much virtue, so much power, we have not yet succeeded\r\nin providing that necessary apparatus of insurance and security,\r\nwithout which our industrial system is not merely incomplete, but\r\nactually inhumane.\r\n\r\nI said that disturbances of our industrial system are often started\r\nfrom outside this country by causes utterly beyond our control. When\r\nthere is an epidemic of cholera, or typhoid, or diphtheria, a healthy\r\nperson runs less risk than one whose constitution is prepared to\r\nreceive the microbes of disease, and even if himself struck down, he\r\nstands a far greater chance of making a speedy recovery. The social\r\nand industrial conditions in Great Britain at this present time cannot\r\nbe described as healthy. I discern in the present industrial system of\r\nour country three vicious conditions which make us peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to any outside disturbance of international trade. First,\r\nthe lack of any central organisation of industry, or any general and\r\nconcerted control either of ordinary Government work, or of any\r\nextraordinary relief works. It would be possible for the Board of\r\nTrade to foretell with a certain amount of accuracy the degree of\r\nunemployment likely to be reached in any winter. It ought to be\r\npossible for some authority in some Government office--which I do not\r\ncare--to view the whole situation in advance, and within certain\r\nlimits to exert a powerful influence over the general distribution of\r\nGovernment contracts.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing economically unsound in increasing temporarily and\r\nartificially the demand for labour during a period of temporary and\r\nartificial contraction. There is a plain need of some averaging\r\nmachinery to regulate and even-up the general course of the labour\r\nmarket, in the same way as the Bank of England, by its bank rate,\r\nregulates and corrects the flow of business enterprise. When the\r\nextent of the depression is foreseen, the extent of the relief should\r\nalso be determined. There ought to be in permanent existence certain\r\nrecognised industries of a useful, but uncompetitive character, like,\r\nwe will say, afforestation, managed by public departments, and capable\r\nof being expanded or contracted according to the needs of the labour\r\nmarket, just as easily as you can pull out the stops or work the\r\npedals of an organ. In this way, you would not eliminate unemployment,\r\nyou certainly would not prevent the creation of unemployables; but you\r\nwould considerably limit the scale of unemployment, you would reduce\r\nthe oscillation of the industrial system, you would increase its\r\nstability, and by every step that you took in that direction you would\r\nfree thousands of your fellow-countrymen from undeserved agony and\r\nruin, and a far greater number from the haunting dread of ruin. That\r\nis the first point--a gap, a hiatus in our social organisation--to\r\nwhich I direct your attention to-night, and upon which the\r\nintelligence of this country ought to be concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe second vicious condition is positive and not negative. I mean the\r\ngross, and, I sometimes fear, increasing evil of casual labour. We\r\ntalk a great deal about the unemployed, but the evil of the\r\n_under-employed_ is the tap-root of unemployment. There is a tendency\r\nin many trades, almost in all trades, to have a fringe of casual\r\nlabour on hand, available as a surplus whenever there is a boom, flung\r\nback into the pool whenever there is a slump. Employers and foremen in\r\nmany trades are drawn consciously or unconsciously to distribute their\r\nwork among a larger number of men than they regularly require, because\r\nthis obviously increases their bargaining power with them, and\r\nsupplies a convenient reserve for periods of brisk business activity.\r\n\r\nAnd what I desire to impress upon you, and through you upon this\r\ncountry, is that the casual unskilled labourer who is habitually\r\nunder-employed, who is lucky to get three, or at the outside four,\r\ndays' work in the week, who may often be out of a job for three or\r\nfour weeks at a time, who in bad times goes under altogether, and who\r\nin good times has no hope of security and no incentive to thrift,\r\nwhose whole life and the lives of his wife and children are embarked\r\nin a sort of blind, desperate, fatalistic gamble with circumstances\r\nbeyond his comprehension or control, that this poor man, this terrible\r\nand pathetic figure, is not as a class the result of accident or\r\nchance, is not casual because he wishes to be casual, is not casual as\r\nthe consequence of some temporary disturbance soon put right. No; the\r\ncasual labourer is here because he is wanted here. He is here in\r\nanswer to a perfectly well-defined demand. He is here as the result of\r\neconomic causes which have been too long unregulated. He is not the\r\nnatural product, he is an article manufactured, called into being, to\r\nsuit the requirements, in the Prime Minister's telling phrase, of all\r\nindustries at particular times and of particular industries at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nI suppose no Department has more means of learning about these things\r\nthan the Board of Trade, which is in friendly touch at every stage all\r\nover the country both with capital and labour. I publish that fact\r\ndeliberately. I invite you to consider it, I want it to soak in. It\r\nappears to me that measures to check the growth and diminish the\r\nquantity of casual labour must be an essential part of any thorough or\r\nscientific attempt to deal with unemployment, and I would not proclaim\r\nthis evil to you without having reason to believe that practicable\r\nmeans exist by which it can be greatly diminished.\r\n\r\nIf the first vicious condition which I have mentioned to you is lack\r\nof industrial organisation, if the second is the evil of casual\r\nlabour, there is a third not less important. I mean the present\r\nconditions of boy labour. The whole underside of the labour market is\r\nderanged by the competition of boys or young persons who do men's work\r\nfor boys' wages, and are turned off so soon as they demand men's wages\r\nfor themselves. That is the evil so far as it affects the men; but how\r\ndoes it affect the boys, the youth of our country, the heirs of all\r\nour exertion, the inheritors of that long treasure of history and\r\nromance, of science and knowledge--aye, of national glory, for which\r\nso many valiant generations have fought and toiled--the youth of\r\nBritain, how are we treating them in the twentieth century of the\r\nChristian era? Are they not being exploited? Are they not being\r\ndemoralised? Are they not being thrown away?\r\n\r\nWhereas the youth of the wealthier class is all kept under strict\r\ndiscipline until eighteen or nineteen, the mass of the nation runs\r\nwild after fourteen years of age. No doubt at first employment is easy\r\nto obtain. There is a wide and varied field; there are a hundred odd\r\njobs for a lad; but almost every form of employment now open to young\r\npersons affords them no opening, is of no use to them whatever when\r\nthey are grown up, and in a great number of cases the life which they\r\nlead is demoralising and harmful. And what is the consequence? The\r\nconsequence may be measured by this grim fact, that out of the\r\nunemployed applying for help under the Unemployed Workmen Act, no less\r\nthan twenty-eight per cent. are between twenty and thirty years of\r\nage, that is to say, men in the first flush of their strength and\r\nmanhood already hopelessly adrift on the dark and tumultuous ocean of\r\nlife. Upon this subject, I say to you deliberately that no boy or girl\r\nought to be treated merely as cheap labour, that up to eighteen years\r\nof age every boy and girl in this country should, as in the old days\r\nof apprenticeship, be learning a trade as well as earning a living.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to deal with these and similar evils involve the\r\nexpenditure of money. It is no use abusing capitalists and rich\r\npeople. They are neither worse nor better than any one else. They\r\nfunction quite naturally under the conditions in which they find\r\nthemselves. When the conditions are vicious, the consequence will be\r\nevil; when the conditions are reformed, the evil will be abated. Nor\r\ndo I think the wealthy people of Great Britain would be ungenerous or\r\nunwilling to respond to the plain need of this nation for a more\r\ncomplete or elaborate social organisation. They would have a natural\r\nobjection to having public money wasted or spent on keeping in\r\nartificial ease an ever-growing class of wastrels and ne'er-do-weels.\r\nNo doubt there would also be a selfish element who would sullenly\r\nresist anything which touched their pocket. But I believe that if\r\nlarge schemes, properly prepared and scientifically conceived for\r\ndealing with the evils I have mentioned were presented, and if it\r\ncould be shown that our national life would be placed upon a far more\r\nstable and secure foundation, I believe that there would be thousands\r\nof rich people who would cheerfully make the necessary sacrifices. At\r\nany rate, we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe year that lies before us must be a year of important finance. No\r\ndoubt that finance will be a subject of fierce and protracted\r\ndiscussion; but I shall certainly not exclude from my mind, in\r\nweighing the chances of social reform, that strong element of\r\npatriotism which is to be found among the more fortunate of our\r\nfellow-countrymen, and which has honourably distinguished them from\r\nthe rich people of other countries I could name.\r\n\r\nI have been dealing with three, and only three, of the evil causes\r\nwhich principally affect labour conditions in Great Britain at the\r\npresent time. Do not forget, however, as the Prime Minister has\r\nreminded us, how intimate is the co-relation of all social reforms,\r\nhow vital it is to national health and security that we should\r\nmaintain an adequate and independent population upon the land, and how\r\nunsatisfactory, in Scotland, at any rate, are the present conditions\r\nfor small holdings. Do not forget, either, how fatal to the social,\r\nmoral, and political progress of British democracy is the curse of\r\nintemperance. There is not a man or woman who lifts a voice and exerts\r\nan influence in support either of land or of temperance reform, who\r\nwill not be doing something not only to alleviate the sufferings of\r\nthe poor, but to stimulate the healthy advance of British prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut see how vast is the range of this question of unemployment with\r\nwhich we are confronted. See now how intricate are its details and\r\nits perplexities; how foolish it would be to legislate in panic or\r\nhaste; how vain it would be to trust to formulas and prejudices; how\r\nearnest must be the study; how patient and laborious the preparation;\r\nhow scientific the spirit, how valiant the action, if that great and\r\nhideous evil of insecurity by which our industrial population are\r\nharassed is to be effectually diminished in our national life. See\r\nnow, also, what sort of politicians those are, whichever extreme of\r\npolitics they may belong to, who tell you that they have an easy,\r\nsimple, and unfailing remedy for such an evil. What sort of\r\nunscrupulous and reckless adventurers they are who tell you that\r\ntariff reform, that a trumpery ten per cent. tariff on foreign\r\nmanufactures, and a tax on wheat would enable them to provide \"work\r\nfor all.\" I was very glad to see that Mr. Balfour frankly and honestly\r\ndissociated himself, the other night at Dumfries, from the impudent\r\npolitical cheap-jacks who are touting the country on behalf of the\r\nTory Party, by boldly declaring that tariff reform, or \"fiscal\r\nreform,\" as he prefers to call it, would be no remedy for unemployment\r\nor trade oscillations.\r\n\r\nNow that Mr. Balfour has made that admission, for which we thank him,\r\nand for which we respect him, I will make one in my turn. If tariff\r\nreform or protection, or fiscal reform, or whatever you choose to call\r\nit, is no remedy for unemployment--and it is pretty clear from the\r\nexperience of other countries who have adopted it on a large scale\r\nthat it is not--neither is free trade by itself a remedy for\r\nunemployment. The evil lies deeper, the causes are more complex than\r\nany within the reach of import duties or of no import duties, and its\r\ntreatment requires special measures of a social, not less than of an\r\neconomic character which are going to carry us into altogether new and\r\nuntrodden fields in British politics.\r\n\r\nI agree most whole-heartedly with those who say that in attempting to\r\nrelieve distress or to regulate the general levels of employment, we\r\nmust be most careful not to facilitate the very disorganisation of\r\nindustry which causes distress. But I do not agree with those who say\r\nthat every man must look after himself, and that the intervention by\r\nthe State in such matters as I have referred to will be fatal to his\r\nself-reliance, his foresight, and his thrift. We are told that our\r\nnon-contributory scheme of old-age pensions, for instance, will be\r\nfatal to thrift, and we are warned that the great mass of the working\r\nclasses will be discouraged thereby from making any effective\r\nprovision for their old age. But what effective provision have they\r\nmade against old age in the past? If terror be an incentive to thrift,\r\nsurely the penalties of the system which we have abandoned ought to\r\nhave stimulated thrift as much as anything could have been stimulated\r\nin this world. The mass of the labouring poor have known that unless\r\nthey made provision for their old age betimes they would perish\r\nmiserably in the workhouse. Yet they have made no provision; and when\r\nI am told that the institution of old-age pensions will prevent the\r\nworking classes from making provision for their old age, I say that\r\ncannot be, for they have never been able to make such provision. And I\r\nbelieve our scheme, so far from preventing thrift, will encourage it\r\nto an extent never before known.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that thrift is caused only by fear;\r\nit springs from hope as well as from fear; where there is no hope, be\r\nsure there will be no thrift. No one supposes that five shillings a\r\nweek is a satisfactory provision for old age. No one supposes that\r\nseventy is the earliest period in a man's life when his infirmities\r\nmay overwhelm him. We have not pretended to carry the toiler on to dry\r\nland; it is beyond our power. What we have done is to strap a lifebelt\r\naround him, whose buoyancy, aiding his own strenuous exertions, ought\r\nto enable him to reach the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd now I say to you Liberals of Scotland and Dundee two\r\nwords--\"Diligence and Daring.\" Let that be your motto for the year\r\nthat is to come. \"Few,\" it is written, \"and evil are the days of man.\"\r\nSoon, very soon, our brief lives will be lived. Soon, very soon, we\r\nand our affairs will have passed away. Uncounted generations will\r\ntrample heedlessly upon our tombs. What is the use of living, if it be\r\nnot to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better\r\nplace for those who will live in it after we are gone? How else can we\r\nput ourselves in harmonious relation with the great verities and\r\nconsolations of the infinite and the eternal? And I avow my faith that\r\nwe are marching towards better days. Humanity will not be cast down.\r\nWe are going on--swinging bravely forward along the grand high\r\nroad--and already behind the distant mountains is the promise of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL FIELD\r\n\r\nBIRMINGHAM, _January 13, 1909_[13]\r\n\r\n(From _The Times_, by permission.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very glad to come here to-night to wish good luck in the New Year\r\nto the Liberals of Birmingham. Good luck is founded on good pluck, and\r\nthat is what I think you will not fail in. Birmingham Liberals have\r\nfor twenty years been over-weighted by the influence of remarkable men\r\nand by the peculiar turn of events. This great city, which used to be\r\nthe home of militant Radicalism, which in former days supplied with\r\ndriving power the cause of natural representation against hereditary\r\nprivilege, has been captured by the foe. The banner of the House of\r\nLords has been flung out over the sons and grandsons of the men who\r\nshook all England in the struggle for the great Reform Bill; and while\r\nold injustice has but been replaced by new, while the miseries and the\r\nprivations of the poor continue in your streets, while the\r\ndifferences between class and class have been even aggravated in the\r\npassage of years, Birmingham is held by the enemy and bound to\r\nretrogression in its crudest form.\r\n\r\nBut this is no time for despondency. The Liberal Party must not allow\r\nitself to be overawed by the hostile Press which is ranged against it.\r\nBoldly and earnestly occupied, the platform will always beat the\r\nPress. Still less should we allow ourselves to be perturbed by the\r\nfortuitous and sporadic results of by-electoral warfare. I suppose I\r\nhave fought as many by-elections as most people, and I know that all\r\nthe advantages lie with the attacking force. The contests are\r\ncomplicated by personal and local influences. The discussions turn\r\nupon the incidents of current legislation. There are always grievances\r\nto be urged against the Government of the day. After a great victory,\r\nall parties, and particularly the Liberals, are prone to a slackening\r\nof effort and organisation; after a great defeat all parties, and\r\nespecially the Tories, are spurred to supreme exertions.\r\n\r\nThese factors are common to all by-elections, under all Governments;\r\nbut never, I venture to say, has it been more important to an\r\nOpposition to gain by-electoral successes than during the present\r\nParliament. It is their only possible line of activity. In the House\r\nof Commons they scarcely show their noses. In divisions they are\r\nabsent; in debate--well, I do not think we need say much about that;\r\nand it is only by a combination of by-electoral incidents properly\r\nadvertised by the Party Press on the one hand, and the House of Lords'\r\nmanipulation upon the other, that the Conservative Party are able to\r\nkeep their heads above water. And when I speak of the importance to\r\nthe Opposition of by-elections, let me also remind you that never\r\nbefore have by-electoral victories been so important, not only to a\r\ngreat Party, but to a great trade.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while I am far from saying that we should be content with\r\nrecent manifestations of the opinion of the electorate, while I do not\r\nat all deny that they involve a sensible reaction of feeling of an\r\nunfavourable character, and while I urge the most strenuous exertions\r\nupon all concerned in party organisation, I assert that there is no\r\nreason, as the history of this country abundantly shows, why a general\r\nelection, at a well-chosen moment, and upon some clear, broad, simple\r\nissue, should not retrieve and restore the whole situation.\r\n\r\nThere could be no question of a Government, hitherto undisturbed by\r\ninternal disagreement and consistently supported in the House of\r\nCommons by a large, united, and intact majority, being deflected one\r\nhair's breadth from its course by the results of by-elections. We have\r\nour work to do, and while we have the power to carry it forward, we\r\nhave no right, even if we had the inclination, to leave it\r\nuncompleted. Certainly we shall not be so foolish, or play so false to\r\nthose who have supported us, as to fight on any ground but that of our\r\nown choosing, or at any time but that most advantageous to the general\r\ninterest of the Progressive cause.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the period are peculiar. The powers of the House\r\nof Lords to impede, and by impeding to discredit, the House of Commons\r\nare strangely bestowed, strangely limited, and still more strangely\r\nexercised. There are little things which they can maul; there are big\r\nthings they cannot touch; there are Bills which they pass, although\r\nthey believe them to be wrong; there are Bills which they reject,\r\nalthough they know them to be right. The House of Lords can prevent\r\nthe trams running over Westminster Bridge; but it cannot prevent a\r\ndeclaration of war. It can reject a Bill prohibiting foreign workmen\r\nbeing brought in to break a British strike; it cannot amend a Bill to\r\ngive old-age pensions to 600,000 people. It can thwart a Government in\r\nthe minute details of its legislation; it cannot touch the whole vast\r\nbusiness of finance. It can prevent the abolition of the plural voter;\r\nbut it could not prevent the abolition of the police. It can refuse a\r\nConstitution to Ireland, but not, luckily, to Africa.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne, in his leadership of the House of Lords during the\r\npresent Parliament, has put forward claims on its behalf far more\r\nimportant and crude than ever were made by the late Lord Salisbury. No\r\nTory leader in modern times has ever taken so high a view of its\r\nrights, and at the same time no one has shown a more modest conception\r\nof its duties. In destroying the Education Bill of 1906 the House of\r\nLords asserted its right to resist the opinion of a majority of members\r\nof the House of Commons, fresh from election, upon a subject which had\r\nbeen one of the most prominent issues of the election. In rejecting\r\nthe Licensing Bill of 1908 they have paraded their utter unconcern for\r\nthe moral welfare of the mass of their fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nThere is one feature in the guidance of the House of Lords by Lord\r\nLansdowne which should specially be noticed, and that is the air of\r\nsolemn humbug with which this ex-Whig is always at pains to invest its\r\nproceedings. The Nonconformist child is forced into the Church school\r\nin single-school areas in the name of parents' rights and religious\r\nequality. The Licensing Bill is rejected in the highest interests of\r\ntemperance. Professing to be a bulwark of the commercial classes\r\nagainst Radical and Socialistic legislation, the House of Lords passes\r\nan Old-Age Pensions Bill, which it asserts will be fatal alike to\r\npublic finance and public thrift, a Mines Eight Hours Bill, which it\r\nis convinced will cripple British industry, and a Trades Disputes\r\nBill, which it loudly declared tyrannous and immoral. Posing as a\r\nChamber of review remote from popular passion, far from the swaying\r\ninfluences of the electorate, it nevertheless exhibits a taste for\r\ncheap electioneering, a subserviency to caucus direction, and a party\r\nspirit upon a level with many of the least reputable elective\r\nChambers in the world; and beneath the imposing mask of an assembly of\r\nnotables backed by the prescription and traditions of centuries we\r\ndiscern the leer of the artful dodger, who has got the straight tip\r\nfrom the party agent.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for reasonable men to defend such a system or such\r\nan institution. Counter-checks upon a democratic Assembly there may\r\nbe, perhaps there should be. But those counter-checks should be in the\r\nnature of delay, and not in the nature of arrest; they should operate\r\nevenly and equally against both political parties, and not against\r\nonly one of them; and above all they should be counter-checks\r\nconceived and employed in the national interest and not in a partisan\r\ninterest. These abuses and absurdities have now reached a point when\r\nit is certain that reform, effective and far-reaching, must be the\r\nnecessary issue at a general election; and, whatever may be the result\r\nof that election, be sure of this, that no Liberal Government will at\r\nany future time assume office without securing guarantees that that\r\nreform shall be carried out.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one reason which would justify a Government,\r\ncircumstanced and supported as we are, in abandoning prematurely the\r\ntrust confided to us by the country. When a Government is impotent,\r\nwhen it is destitute of ideas and devoid of the power to give effect\r\nto them, when it is brought to a complete arrest upon the vital and\r\nessential lines of its policy, then I entirely agree that the sooner\r\nit divests itself of responsibilities which it cannot discharge, the\r\nbetter for the country it governs and the Party it represents. No one\r\nwho looks back over the three busy years of legislation which have\r\njust been completed can find any grounds for such a view of our\r\nposition; and although we have sustained checks and vexations from\r\ncircumstances beyond our control which have prevented us settling, as\r\nwe otherwise would have done, the problems of licensing and of\r\neducation, no lover of progress who compares the Statute-book as it\r\nstands to-day with its state in 1905, need feel that he has laboured\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nNo one can say that we have been powerless in the past. The trade\r\nunionist as he surveys the progress of his organisation, the miner as\r\nthe cage brings him to the surface of the ground, the aged pensioner\r\nwhen he visits the post office with his cheque-book, the Irish\r\nCatholic whose son sees the ranges of a University career thrown\r\nopen, the child who is protected in his home and in the street, the\r\npeasant who desires to acquire a share of the soil he tills, the\r\nyouthful offender in the prison, the citizen as he takes his seat on\r\nthe county bench, the servant who is injured in domestic service, all\r\ngive the lie to that--all can bear witness to the workings of a\r\ntireless social and humanitarian activity, which, directed by\r\nknowledge and backed by power, tends steadily to make our country a\r\nbetter place for the many, without at the same time making it a bad\r\nplace for the few.\r\n\r\nBut, if we have been powerful in the past, shall we then be powerless\r\nin the future? Let the year that has now opened make its answer to\r\nthat. We shall see before many months are passed whether his Majesty's\r\nGovernment, and the House of Commons, by which it is supported, do not\r\nstill possess effective means to carry out their policy, not only upon\r\nthose important political issues in which we have been for the time\r\nbeing thwarted, but also in that still wider and, in my opinion, more\r\nimportant field of social organisation into which, under the\r\nleadership of the Prime Minister, we shall now proceed to advance.\r\n\r\nI do not, of course, ignore the fact that the House of Lords has the\r\npower, though not the constitutional right, to bring the government of\r\nthe country to a standstill by rejecting the provision which the\r\nCommons make for the financial service of the year. That is a matter\r\nwhich does not rest with us, it rests with them. If they want a speedy\r\ndissolution, they know where to find one. If they really believe, as\r\nthey so loudly proclaim, that the country will hail them as its\r\nsaviours, they can put it to the proof. If they are ambitious to play\r\nfor stakes as high as any Second Chamber has ever risked, we shall not\r\nbe wanting. And, for my part, I should be quite content to see the\r\nbattle joined as speedily as possible upon the plain, simple issue of\r\naristocratic rule against representative government, between the\r\nreversion to protection and the maintenance of free trade, between a\r\ntax on bread and a tax on--well, never mind. And if they do not\r\nchoose, or do not dare to use the powers they most injuriously\r\npossess, if fear, I say, or tactics, or prudence, or some lingering\r\nsense of constitutional decency, restrains them, then for Heaven's\r\nsake let us hear no more of these taunts, that we, the Liberal Party,\r\nare afraid to go to the country, that we do not possess its\r\nconfidence, and that we are impotent to give effect to the essential\r\npurposes of our policy.\r\n\r\nSubject to such a constitutional outrage as I have indicated, his\r\nMajesty's Government will claim their right and use their power to\r\npresent the Liberal case as a whole to the judgment of the whole body\r\nof electors. That case is already largely developed. How utterly have\r\nall those predictions been falsified that a Liberal Government would\r\nbe incapable of the successful conduct of Imperial affairs! Whether\r\nyou look at our position in Europe, or at the difficult conduct of\r\nIndian administration, or the relations which have been preserved, and\r\nin some cases restored, with our self-governing Colonies, the policy\r\nof the Government has been attended with so much success that it has\r\nnot only commanded the approval of impartial persons, but has silenced\r\npolitical criticism itself.\r\n\r\nIt was in South Africa that we were most of all opposed and most of\r\nall distrusted, and by a singular inversion it is in South Africa that\r\nthe most brilliant and memorable results have been achieved. Indeed, I\r\nthink that the gift of the Transvaal and Orange River Constitutions\r\nand the great settlement resulting therefrom will be by itself as a\r\nsingle event sufficient to vindicate in the eyes of future generations\r\nthe administration of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and to dignify his\r\nmemory in Parliaments and periods which we shall not see. But our work\r\nabroad is not yet completed, has not yet come to its full fruition. If\r\nwe should continue, as I expect we shall, to direct public affairs for\r\nthe full five years which are the normal and the healthy period of\r\nBritish Administrations, we may look for a further advance and\r\nimprovement in all the great external spheres of Imperial policy. We\r\nmay look in India for a greater sense of confidence and solidarity\r\nbetween the people and the Government. We shall salute the sunrise of\r\nSouth Africa united under the British Crown. And in Europe I trust\r\nthat Sir Edward Grey will have crowned his work at the Foreign Office\r\nby establishing a better and kindlier feeling between the British and\r\nthe German peoples. That will be the record of policy beyond the seas\r\non which we shall appeal for judgment and for justice.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that, contrary to general expectation, our policy has\r\nprospered better abroad than at home, you have not far to look for\r\nthe reason. Abroad we have enjoyed full responsibility, a free hand,\r\nand fair-play; at home we have had a divided authority, a fettered\r\nhand, and the reverse of fair-play. We have been hampered and we have\r\nbeen harassed. We have done much; we could have done much more.\r\n\r\nOur policy at home is less complete and less matured than it is\r\nabroad. But it so happens that many of the most important steps which\r\nwe should now take, are of such a character that the House of Lords\r\nwill either not be able or will not be anxious to obstruct them, and\r\ncould not do so except by courting altogether novel dangers. The\r\nsocial field lies open. There is no great country where the\r\norganisation of industrial conditions more urgently demands attention.\r\nWherever the reformer casts his eyes he is confronted with a mass of\r\nlargely preventable and even curable suffering. The fortunate people\r\nin Britain are more happy than any other equally numerous class have\r\nbeen in the whole history of the world. I believe the left-out\r\nmillions are more miserable. Our vanguard enjoys all the delights of\r\nall the ages. Our rearguard straggles out into conditions which are\r\ncrueller than barbarism. The unemployed artisan, the casual labourer,\r\nand the casual labourer's wife and children, the sweated worker, the\r\ninfirm worker, the worker's widow, the under-fed child, the untrained,\r\nundisciplined, and exploited boy labourer--it is upon these subjects\r\nthat our minds should dwell in the early days of 1909.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Party has always known the joy which comes from serving\r\ngreat causes. It must also cherish the joy which comes from making\r\ngood arrangements. We shall be all the stronger in the day of battle\r\nif we can show that we have neglected no practicable measure by which\r\nthese evils can be diminished, and can prove by fact and not by words\r\nthat, while we strive for civil and religious equality, we also labour\r\nto build up--so far as social machinery can avail--tolerable basic\r\nconditions for our fellow-countrymen. There lies the march, and those\r\nwho valiantly pursue it need never fear to lose their hold upon the\r\nheart of Britain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] In the interval between this and the preceding speech the House of\r\nLords had rejected the Licensing Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPROACHING CONFLICT\r\n\r\nNOTTINGHAM, _January 30, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Manchester Guardian_, by permission of the Editor.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are met together at a time when great exertions and a high\r\nconstancy are required from all who cherish and sustain the Liberal\r\ncause. Difficulties surround us and dangers threaten from this side\r\nand from that. You know the position which has been created by the\r\naction of the House of Lords. Two great political Parties divide all\r\nEngland between them in their conflicts. Now it is discovered that one\r\nof these Parties possesses an unfair weapon--that one of these\r\nParties, after it is beaten at an election, after it is deprived of\r\nthe support and confidence of the country, after it is destitute of a\r\nmajority in the representative Assembly, when it sits in the shades of\r\nOpposition without responsibility, or representative authority, under\r\nthe frown, so to speak, of the Constitution, nevertheless possesses a\r\nweapon, an instrument, a tool, a utensil--call it what you will--with\r\nwhich it can harass, vex, impede, affront, humiliate, and finally\r\ndestroy the most serious labours of the other. When it is realised\r\nthat the Party which possesses this prodigious and unfair advantage is\r\nin the main the Party of the rich against the poor, of the classes and\r\ntheir dependants against the masses, of the lucky, the wealthy, the\r\nhappy, and the strong against the left-out and the shut-out millions\r\nof the weak and poor, you will see how serious the constitutional\r\nsituation has become.\r\n\r\nA period of supreme effort lies before you. The election with which\r\nthis Parliament will close, and towards which we are moving, is one\r\nwhich is different in notable features from any other which we have\r\nknown. Looking back over the politics of the last thirty years, we\r\nhardly ever see a Conservative Opposition approaching an election\r\nwithout a programme, on paper at any rate, of social and democratic\r\nreform. There was Lord Beaconsfield with his policy of \"health and the\r\nlaws of health.\" There was the Tory democracy of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill in 1885 and 1886, with large, far-reaching plans of Liberal\r\nand democratic reform, of a generous policy to Ireland, of\r\nretrenchment and reduction of expenditure upon naval and military\r\narmaments--all promises to the people, and for the sake of which he\r\nresigned rather than play them false. Then you have the elections of\r\n1892 and 1895. In each the Conservative Party, whether in office or\r\nopposition, was, under the powerful influence of Mr. Chamberlain,\r\ncommitted to most extensive social programmes, of what we should call\r\nLiberal and Radical reforms, like the Workmen's Compensation Act and\r\nOld-Age Pensions, part of which were carried out by them and part by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nBut what social legislation, what plans of reform do the Conservative\r\nParty offer now to the working people of England if they will return\r\nthem to power? I have studied very carefully the speeches of their\r\nleaders--if you can call them leaders--and I have failed to discover a\r\nsingle plan of social reform or reconstruction. Upon the grim and\r\nsombre problems of the Poor Law they have no policy whatever. Upon\r\nunemployment no policy whatever; for the evils of intemperance no\r\npolicy whatever, except to make sure of the public-house vote; upon\r\nthe question of the land, monopolised as it is in the hands of so\r\nfew, denied to so many, no policy whatever; for the distresses of\r\nIreland, for the relations between the Irish and British peoples, no\r\npolicy whatever unless it be coercion. In other directions where they\r\nhave a policy, it is worse than no policy. For Scotland the Lords'\r\nveto, for Wales a Church repugnant to the conscience of the\r\noverwhelming majority of the Welsh people, crammed down their throats\r\nat their own expense.\r\n\r\nYet we are told they are confident of victory, they are persuaded that\r\nthe country has already forgotten the follies and even the crimes of\r\nthe late Administration, and that the general contempt and disgust in\r\nwhich they were dismissed from power has already passed away. They are\r\nalready busy making their Cabinet, who is to be put in and, what is\r\nnot less important, who is to be put out. Lists of selection and lists\r\nof proscription are being framed. The two factions into which they are\r\ndivided, the Balfourites and the tariff reformers, are each acutely\r\nconscious of one another's infirmities, and, through their respective\r\norgans, they have succeeded in proving to their apparent satisfaction\r\nwhat most of us have known, and some of us have said for a long time\r\npast, that they are an uncommonly poor lot all round.\r\n\r\nIt would be bad enough if a Party so destitute, according to its own\r\nstatement, of political merit were to return with the intention of\r\ndoing nothing but repeating and renewing our experiences under Mr.\r\nBalfour's late Administration, of dragging through empty sessions, of\r\nsneering at every philanthropic enthusiasm, of flinging a sop from\r\ntime to time to the brewers or the parsons or the landed classes. But\r\nthose would not be the consequences which would follow from the Tory\r\ntriumph. Consequences far more grave, immeasurably more disastrous,\r\nwould follow. We are not offered an alternative policy of progress, we\r\nare not confronted even with a policy of standstill, we are confronted\r\nwith an organised policy of constructive reaction. We are to march\r\nback into those shades from which we had hoped British civilisation\r\nand British science had finally emerged.\r\n\r\nIf the Conservative Party win the election they have made it perfectly\r\nclear that it is their intention to impose a complete protective\r\ntariff, and to raise the money for ambitious armaments and colonial\r\nprojects by taxing the poor. They have declared, with a frankness\r\nwhich is, at any rate, remarkable, that they will immediately proceed\r\nto put a tax on bread, a tax on meat, a tax on timber, and an\r\ninnumerable schedule of taxes on all manufactured articles imported\r\ninto the United Kingdom; that is to say, that they will take by all\r\nthese taxes a large sum of money from the pockets of the wage-earners,\r\nby making them pay more for the food they eat, the houses they live\r\nin, and the comforts and conveniences which they require in their\r\nhomes, and that a great part of this large sum of money will be\r\ndivided between the landlords and the manufacturers in the shape of\r\nincreased profits; and even that part of it which does reach the\r\nExchequer is to be given back to these same classes in the shape of\r\nreductions in income-tax and in direct taxation. If you face the\r\npolicy with which we are now threatened by the Conservative Party\r\nfairly and searchingly, you will see that it is nothing less than a\r\ndeliberate attempt on the part of important sections of the propertied\r\nclasses to transfer their existing burdens to the shoulders of the\r\nmasses of the people, and to gain greater profits for the investment\r\nof their capital by charging higher prices.\r\n\r\nIt is very natural that a Party nourishing such designs should be\r\napprehensive of criticism and of opposition; but I must say I have\r\nnever heard of a Party which was in such a jumpy, nervous state as our\r\nopponents are at this present time. If one is led in the course of a\r\nspeech, as I sometimes am, to speak a little firmly and bluntly about\r\nthe Conservative tariff reformers, they become almost speechless with\r\nindignation. They are always in a state of incipient political\r\napoplexy, while as for the so-called Liberal Unionists, whenever they\r\nare criticised, they never leave off whining and say that it is\r\nunchivalrous to attack them while Mr. Chamberlain is disabled. Sorry I\r\nam that he is out of the battle, not only on personal, but on public\r\ngrounds. His fiercest opponents would welcome his re-entry into the\r\npolitical arena, if only for the fact that we should then have a man\r\nto deal with, and some one whose statement of the case for his side\r\nwould be clear and bold, whose speeches would be worth reading and\r\nworth answering, instead of the melancholy marionettes whom the\r\nwire-pullers of the Tariff Reform League are accustomed to exhibit on\r\nprovincial platforms. But I hope you will not let these pretexts or\r\ncomplaints move you or prevent you from calling a spade a spade, a tax\r\na tax, a protective tariff a gigantic dodge to cheat the poor, or the\r\nLiberal Unionist party the most illiberal thing on record.\r\n\r\nBut if the tariff reformers are so touchy and intolerant that they\r\nresent the slightest attack or criticism from their opponents as if it\r\nwere sacrilege, that is nothing to the fury which they exhibit when\r\nany of their friends on the Conservative side begin to ask a few\r\nquestions. One would have thought at least that matters of such\r\ngravity and such novelty should be considered fairly on their merits.\r\nBut what does Mr. Austen Chamberlain say? He tells us that no\r\nhesitation will be tolerated from Unionist Members of Parliament in\r\nregard to any tariff reform proposals which may in a future Parliament\r\nbe submitted--by whoever may be the Chancellor of the Exchequer. No\r\nhesitation will be tolerated. Not opposition, not criticism, not\r\ndissent, but no hesitation will be tolerated. The members of the\r\nUnionist Party are to go to the next Parliament, not as honest\r\ngentlemen, free to use their minds and intelligences. They are to go\r\nas the pledged, tied-up delegates of a caucus, forced to swallow\r\nwithout hesitation details of a tariff which they have not even seen;\r\ndenied the right which every self-respecting man should claim, to give\r\ntheir vote on grand and cardinal issues according to their faith and\r\ntheir conscience. And in order that those who would refuse to be bound\r\nby these dishonouring conditions may be smelt out and excluded from\r\nthe House of Commons, a secret society of nameless but probably\r\ninterested busybodies is hard at work in all the dirtiest sewers of\r\npolitical intrigue.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, these methods are an inseparable part of the process\r\nof carrying a protectionist tariff. The whole question resolves itself\r\ninto a matter of \"business is business,\" and the predatory interests\r\nwhich have banded themselves together to finance and organise the\r\ntariff campaign cannot be expected to put up with the conscientious\r\nscruples and reasonable hesitations of Members of Parliament. It will\r\nbe a cash transaction throughout, with large profits and quick\r\ndelivery. Every little would-be monopolist in the country is going to\r\nhave his own association to run his own particular trade. Every\r\nconstituency will be forced to join in the scramble, and to secure\r\nspecial favours at the expense of the commonwealth for its special\r\nbranches of industry. All the elections of the future will turn on\r\ntariffs. Why, you can see the thing beginning already. That egregious\r\nTariff Commission have been dividing all the loot among themselves\r\nbefore the battle has been won--dividing the lion's skin while the\r\nbeast lives--and I was reading only the other day that the\r\nConservatives of Norwood have decided that they could not support\r\ntheir Member any longer, because, forsooth, he would not pledge\r\nhimself to vote for a special tax on foreign imported chairs and\r\nwindow panes. It is the same in every country.\r\n\r\nSuch is the great conspiracy with which the British democracy is now\r\nconfronted--an attempt to place the main burden of taxation upon the\r\nshoulders of wage-earners and not on income-drawers, a disastrous blow\r\nat the prosperity, the freedom, the flexibility, and the expansive\r\npower of British industry, and a deadly injury to the purity of\r\nEnglish public life. The Conservative Party tell us that if they win\r\nthe victory they will screw a protective tariff on our necks. What do\r\nwe say? What of the House of Lords? We say that if we win, we will\r\nsmash to pieces the veto of the House of Lords. If we should obtain a\r\nmajority at the next election--and I have good hopes that if we act\r\nwith wisdom and with union, and, above all, with courage, we shall\r\nundoubtedly obtain an effective majority--the prize we shall claim\r\nwill be a final change in the relations of the two Houses of\r\nParliament, of such a character as to enable the House of Commons to\r\nmake its will supreme within the lifetime of a single Parliament; and\r\nexcept upon that basis, or for the express purpose of effecting that\r\nchange, we will not accept any responsibility for the conduct of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nBut there is another issue which must not be overlooked. I mean the\r\nsocial issue. We have taken a great step already. I must say that he\r\nis rather a sour kind of man who can find nothing to notice in the\r\nOld-Age Pensions Act except its little flaws and petty defects. I\r\nthink you will feel, on the contrary, that the establishment of the\r\npensions system is a marvellous and impressive example of the power\r\nwhich British Governments possess. Without a hitch, perfectly\r\nsmoothly, punctual to the minute, regular as clockwork, nearly\r\n600,000 aged persons are being paid their pensions every week. That is\r\na wonderful and beneficent achievement, a good job well worth some\r\nrisk and sweat to finish. Nearly eight millions of money are being\r\nsent circulating through unusual channels, long frozen by poverty,\r\ncirculating in the homes of the poor, flowing through the little shops\r\nwhich cater to their needs, cementing again family unions which harsh\r\nfate was tearing asunder, uniting the wife to the husband, and the\r\nparent to the children. No; in spite of Socialistic sneer and Tory\r\njeer and glorious beer, and all the rest of it, I say it is a noble\r\nand inspiring event, for which this Parliament will be justly honoured\r\nby generations unborn. I said just now that a Tory tariff victory\r\nmeant marching backwards, but there are some things they cannot undo.\r\nWe may be driven from power. We may desire to be released from\r\nresponsibility. Much of our work may be cut short, much may be\r\noverturned. But there are some things which Tory reaction will not\r\ndare to touch, and, like the settlement and reconciliation of South\r\nAfrica, so the Old-Age Pensions Act will live and grow and ripen as\r\nthe years roll by, far beyond the reach of Party warfare and far\r\nabove the changing moods of faction.\r\n\r\nThere are many political injustices in this country and many absurd,\r\noppressive, or obsolete practices. But the main aspirations of the\r\nBritish people are at this present time social rather than political.\r\nThey see around them on every side, and almost every day, spectacles\r\nof confusion and misery which they cannot reconcile with any\r\nconception of humanity or justice. They see that there are in the\r\nmodern state a score of misfortunes that can happen to a man without\r\nhis being in fault in any way, and without his being able to guard\r\nagainst them in any way. They see, on the other hand, the mighty power\r\nof science, backed by wealth and power, to introduce order, to provide\r\nsafeguards, to prevent accidents, or at least to mitigate their\r\nconsequences. They know that this country is the richest in the world;\r\nand in my sincere judgment the British democracy will not give their\r\nhearts to any Party that is not able and willing to set up that\r\nlarger, fuller, more elaborate, more thorough social organisation,\r\nwithout which our country and its people will inevitably sink through\r\nsorrow to disaster and our name and fame fade upon the pages of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWe have done some of that work, and we are going to do more. In moving\r\nforward to this great struggle which is approaching, we are going to\r\ncarry our social policy along with us. We are not going to fight alone\r\nupon the political and constitutional issue, nor alone upon the\r\ndefence of free trade. We are going, fearless of the consequences,\r\nconfident of our faith, to place before the nation a wide,\r\ncomprehensive, interdependent scheme of social organisation--to place\r\nit before the people not merely in the speeches or placards of a Party\r\nprogramme, but by a massive series of legislative proposals and\r\nadministrative acts. If we are interrupted or impeded in our march,\r\nthe nation will know how to deal with those who stand in the path of\r\nvital and necessary reforms. And I am confident that in the day of\r\nbattle the victory will be to the earnest and to the persevering; and\r\nthen again will be heard the doleful wail of Tory rout and ruin, and\r\nthe loud and resounding acclamations with which the triumphant armies\r\nof democracy will march once again into the central place of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND READING OF THE ANTI-SWEATING BILL[14]\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _April 28, 1909_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a serious national evil that any class of his Majesty's subjects\r\nshould receive in return for their utmost exertions less than a living\r\nwage.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that the workings of the laws of supply and\r\ndemand would in the regular and natural course of events, and by a\r\nsteady progression, eliminate that evil, and achieve adequate minimum\r\nstandards. Modern opinion has found it necessary greatly to refine\r\nupon these broad generalisations of the truth, and the first clear\r\ndivision that we make to-day in questions of wages, is that between a\r\nhealthy and unhealthy condition of bargaining.\r\n\r\nWhere, as in the great staple trades of this country, you have\r\npowerful organisations on both sides, with responsible leaders able\r\nto bind their constituents to their decisions, conjoined with\r\nautomatic scales, or arbitration or conciliation in case of a\r\ndeadlock, there you have a healthy condition of bargaining, which\r\nincreases the competitive power of the industry, which continually\r\nweaves more closely together the fortunes of Capital and Labour, and\r\nwhich enforces a constant progression in the standards of living and\r\nof productive power. But where, as in what we call \"Sweated trades,\"\r\nyou have no organisation at all on either side, no parity of\r\nbargaining between employers and employed, where the good employer is\r\ncontinually undercut by the bad, and the bad again by the worse; where\r\nthe worker whose whole livelihood depends on the trade is undercut by\r\nthe worker to whom it is only a second string; where the feebleness\r\nand ignorance of the workers and their isolation from each other\r\nrender them an easy prey to the tyranny of bad masters, and middlemen\r\none step above them upon the lowest rungs of the ladder, and\r\nthemselves held in the grip of the same relentless forces--there you\r\nhave a condition not of progress but of progressive degeneration. And\r\njust as in the former case the upward tendency will be constant if it\r\nis not interrupted by external power, so in the latter case the\r\ndemoralisation will continue in a squalid welter for periods which are\r\nquite indefinite so far as our brief lives are concerned.\r\n\r\nWe have seen from the investigations of the last twenty years, when\r\nthe phenomena of sweating have been under close and scientific review,\r\nthat there is no power of self-cure within the area of the evil. We\r\nhave seen that while the general advance in the standards of work and\r\nwages has on the whole been constant, these morbid and diseased\r\npatches, which we call the Sweated Trades, have not shared in that\r\nimprovement, but have remained in a state of chronic depression and\r\ndegeneration. The same shocking facts, in some cases the same pitiful\r\nwitnesses, were brought before the Select Committee last year as\r\nbefore Lord Dunraven's Committee in 1888. Indeed I am advised that in\r\nsome respects wages and conditions are worse than they were twenty\r\nyears ago. Nor are these melancholy facts confined to any one country.\r\nSweating is not a peculiarity of Great Britain. Practically the same\r\ntrades experience the same evils in all other industrial countries.\r\nFrance, Germany, Austria, and America reproduce with great exactness\r\nunder similar economic conditions the same social evils, and in those\r\ncountries, as in ours, Sweated Industries--by which I mean trades\r\nwhere there is no organisation, where wages are exceptionally low, and\r\nconditions subversive of physical health and moral welfare--cast dark\r\nshadows in what is, upon the whole, the growing and broadening light\r\nof civilisation.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear reason for this, which is in itself at once a\r\njustification for the special treatment which we propose for these\r\ntrades, and a means of marking them off more or less definitely from\r\nthe ordinary trades. In the case of any great staple trade in this\r\ncountry, if the rate of wages became unnaturally low compared to other\r\nindustries, and the workers could not raise it by any pressure on\r\ntheir part, the new generation at any rate would exercise a preference\r\nfor better pay and more attractive forms of industry. The gradual\r\ncorrection of depressed conditions over large periods of time is thus\r\npossible. But in these sweated industries there is no new generation\r\nto come to the rescue. They are recruited from a class rather than\r\nfrom a section of the community. The widow, the women folk of the\r\npoorest type of labourer, the broken, the weak, the struggling, the\r\ndiseased--those are the people who largely depend upon these trades,\r\nand they have not the same mobility of choice, exerted, tardily though\r\nit be, by a new generation, but which is undoubtedly operative upon\r\nthe great staple trades of the country. That is an explanation which\r\naccounts for the same evils being reproduced under similar conditions\r\nin different countries, separated widely from one another and marked\r\nby great differences of general conditions.\r\n\r\nI ask the House to regard these industries as sick and diseased\r\nindustries. I ask Parliament to deal with them exactly in the same\r\nmood and temper as we should deal with sick people. It would be cruel\r\nto prescribe the same law for the sick as for the sound. It would be\r\nabsurd to apply to the healthy the restrictions required for the sick.\r\nFurther, these sweated trades are not inanimate abstractions. They are\r\nliving, almost sentient, things. Let the House think of these sweated\r\ntrades as patients in a hospital ward. Each case must be studied and\r\ntreated entirely by itself. No general rule can be applied. There is\r\nno regulation dose which will cure them all. You cannot effect quicker\r\ncures by giving larger doses. Different medicines, different diets,\r\ndifferent operations are required for each; and consideration,\r\nencouragement, nursing, personal effort are necessary for all. Great\r\nflexibility and variety of procedure, and a wide discretionary power,\r\nentrusted to earnest and competent people, must characterise any\r\nattempt to legislate on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe central principle of this Bill is the establishment of Trade\r\nBoards, which will be charged with the duty of fixing a minimum wage.\r\nI am very anxious to give these Trade Boards the utmost possible\r\nsubstance and recognition. They will be formed on the principle of\r\nequality of representation for employers and employed, with a skilled\r\nofficial chairman or nucleus. That is the principle I have adopted in\r\nthe new Arbitration Court recently established. That is the principle\r\nwhich will govern the system of Labour Exchanges, shortly to be\r\nintroduced, and other measures which may come to be associated with\r\nLabour Exchanges, and I think it is an excellent principle.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, do not let us suppose that these Trade Boards will,\r\nin the first instance, be very strong or representative bodies. They\r\nare to be formed in trades mainly worked by women, where no\r\norganisation has ever yet taken root, where there are as yet no means\r\nof finding and focusing an effective trade opinion. Where possible,\r\nthey will be partly elective; in many cases they will, I expect, have\r\nto begin by being almost entirely nominated. In some cases it will be\r\nupon the official members alone that the main burden will fall. I\r\ncould not ask the House to confer upon bodies of this nebulous\r\ncharacter, not representative, not elective in any democratic sense,\r\nresponsible not to constituents, nor to a public department, nor to\r\nParliament itself in any way, the absolute and final power of\r\nenforcing by the whole apparatus of the law any decision, whether wise\r\nor foolish, upon wage questions to which they may come by the\r\nnarrowest majority. The work which we entrust to them wholly and\r\nfinally is sufficiently difficult and important. We direct them by\r\nthis Bill to prescribe minimum rates of wages. They are to find the\r\nminimum rate. For that purpose they are as well qualified as any body\r\nthat we could devise. In this sphere their jurisdiction will be\r\ncomplete. The Board of Trade will not retry the question of what is\r\nthe right minimum rate. Another and quite different question will be\r\ndecided by the Board of Trade. They will decide whether the minimum\r\nrate which has been prescribed by the Trade Board commands sufficient\r\nsupport in the trade to make its enforcement by inspection and\r\nprosecution likely to be effective.\r\n\r\nThat is the division between the responsibility which the Trade Boards\r\nwill have and the responsibility which we shall reserve to ourselves.\r\nI shall be quite ready in Committee to express that intention, which\r\nis in the Bill, in a simpler and stronger manner, and to make the\r\nfunction of the Board of Trade a positive and not a negative one, so\r\nthat when the Trade Board has fixed the minimum rate of wages it\r\nshall, after an interval of six months, acquire the force of law, and\r\nshall be enforced by compulsory powers, unless in the meanwhile the\r\nBoard of Trade decides or rules otherwise. For my part, I gladly give\r\nan assurance that it is our intention to put the compulsory provisions\r\nof this Bill into full effect upon at least one of the trades in the\r\nschedule, at as early a date as possible, in order to bring about the\r\nfulfilment of a much-needed and long-overdue experiment.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the probationary period, and I know that there are a\r\ngreat many who have stated that it is mere waste of time. I, on the\r\ncontrary, have been led to the opinion that it is vital to any\r\npractical or effective policy against sweating. It is no use to\r\nattempt, in trades as complex and obscure as these with which we are\r\ndealing, to substitute outside authority for trade opinion. The only\r\nhope lies in the judicious combination of the two, each acting and\r\nreacting upon the other. A mere increase of the penal provisions and\r\ninspection would be a poor compensation for the active support of a\r\npowerful section within the trade itself. It is upon the probationary\r\nperiod that we rely to enable us to rally to the Trade Board and to\r\nits minimum wage the best employers in the trade. In most instances\r\nthe best employers in the trade are already paying wages equal or\r\nsuperior to the probable minimum which the Trade Board will establish.\r\nThe inquiries which I have set on foot in the various trades scheduled\r\nhave brought to me most satisfactory assurances from nearly all the\r\nemployers to whom my investigators have addressed themselves.\r\n\r\nFor the enforcement of this Act, and for the prevention of evasion and\r\ncollusion, I rely upon the factory inspectors, who will report\r\nanything that has come to their notice on their rounds and who will\r\nmake themselves a channel for complaints. I rely still more upon the\r\nspecial peripatetic inspectors and investigators who will be appointed\r\nunder the Act by the Board of Trade, who will have to conduct\r\nprosecutions under the Act, and who will devote all their time to the\r\npurposes of the Act. These officers will incidentally clothe the Trade\r\nBoards with real authority, once the rate has been enforced, in that\r\nthey will be responsible to the Trade Board, and not to some powerful\r\nDepartment of Government external to the Trade Board itself. I rely\r\nfurther upon the support of the members of the Trade Boards\r\nthemselves, who will act as watch-dogs and propagandists. I rely upon\r\nthe driving power of publicity and of public opinion. But most of all\r\nI put my faith in the practical effect of a powerful band of\r\nemployers, perhaps a majority, who, whether from high motives or\r\nself-interest, or from a combination of the two--they are not\r\nnecessarily incompatible ideas--will form a vigilant and instructed\r\npolice, knowing every turn and twist of the trade, and who will labour\r\nconstantly to protect themselves from being undercut by the illegal\r\ncompetition of unscrupulous rivals.\r\n\r\nAn investigator in the East End of London writes:\r\n\r\n\"The people who can check evasion are the large firms. Their\r\ntravellers form a magnificent body of inspectors, who ought to see\r\nthat the Act is enforced. The checking of evasion will have to be\r\ncarried out, not so much by visiting workshops and home-workers as by\r\nhearing where cheap, low-class goods are coming into the market, and\r\ntracing the goods back to the contractors who made them.\"\r\n\r\nThere are solid reasons on which we on this side of the House who are\r\nFree Traders rely with confidence, when we associate ourselves with\r\nthis class of legislation. First of all, we must not imagine that this\r\nis the only European country which has taken steps to deal with\r\nsweating. The first exhibition of sweated products was held in Berlin,\r\nand it was from that exhibition that the idea was obtained of holding\r\nthat most valuable series of exhibitions throughout this country\r\nwhich created the driving power which renders this Bill possible. I am\r\nadvised that German legislation on some of these questions has even\r\nanticipated us. In other countries legislation is pending on\r\nprinciples not dissimilar from those which we advocate. In Bavaria and\r\nBaden the latest reports are to the effect that the official\r\nGovernment Reports of Inquiries recommend almost the same and in some\r\ncases stronger provisions than those to which we now ask the assent of\r\nthe House of Commons. This may be said in a different form of Austria.\r\nAll this movement which is going on throughout Europe, and which is so\r\npregnant with good, will be powerfully stimulated by our action in\r\nthis country, and that stimulus will not only facilitate our work by\r\nremoving the argument which causes hon. gentlemen opposite anxiety,\r\nbut it will also, I think, redound to the credit of this country that\r\nit took a leading and prominent position in what is a noble and\r\nbenignant work.\r\n\r\nI was delighted to hear the Leader of the Opposition say, in a concise\r\nand cogent sentence, that he could easily conceive many sweated trades\r\nin which the wages of the workers could be substantially raised\r\nwithout any other change except a diminution of price. Sir, the wages\r\nof a sweated worker bear no accurate relation to the ultimate price.\r\nSometimes they vary in the same places for the same work done at the\r\nsame time. And sometimes the worst sweating forms a part of the\r\nproduction of articles of luxury sold at the very highest price. We\r\nbelieve further, however, that decent conditions make for industrial\r\nefficiency and increase rather than diminish competitive power.\r\n\"General low wages,\" said Mill, \"never caused any country to undersell\r\nits rivals; nor did general high wages ever hinder it.\" The employers\r\nwho now pay the best wages in these sweated trades maintain themselves\r\nnot only against the comparatively small element of foreign\r\ncompetition in these trades, but against what is a far more formidable\r\ncompetition for this purpose--the competition of those employers who\r\nhabitually undercut them by the worst processes of sweating. I cannot\r\nbelieve that the process of raising the degenerate and parasitical\r\nportion of these trades up to the level of the most efficient branches\r\nof the trade, if it is conducted by those conversant with the\r\nconditions of the trade and interested in it, will necessarily result\r\nin an increase of the price of the ultimate product. It may, even as\r\nthe right hon. gentleman has said, sensibly diminish it through better\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nSir, it is on these grounds, and within these limits, that I ask for a\r\nSecond Reading for this Bill.\r\n\r\nThe principles and objects are scarcely disputed here. Let us go into\r\nCommittee and set to work upon the details, actuated by a\r\nsingle-minded desire to produce a practical result. It is by the\r\nevidences of successful experiment that, more than any other way, we\r\nshall forward and extend the area of our operations; and in passing\r\nthis Bill the House will not only deal manfully with a grave and\r\npiteous social evil, but it will also take another step along that\r\npath of social organisation into which we have boldly entered, and\r\nupon which the Parliaments of this generation, whatever their\r\ncomplexion, will have to march.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Otherwise called \"The Trade Boards Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOUR EXCHANGES AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _May 19, 1909_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe functions of Government in relation to industrial life may be\r\ndivided into three categories--discipline, organisation, and relief.\r\nThe control and regulation of industrial conditions by penal and\r\ndisciplinary powers belong to the Home Office, the relieving and\r\ncurative processes are entrusted to the Local Government Board, and\r\nthe organisation of industry falls to the province of the Board of\r\nTrade. The proposals which I now submit to the House are concerned\r\nonly with organisation; they can be judged only in relation to that\r\nsection of the subject; they do not pretend to stretch beyond it, or\r\nto include other not less important aspects; and I ask that they shall\r\nnot be impugned, because, in dealing with the evils which properly\r\nfall within that sphere, they do not extend to other evils that lie\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nI ask permission to introduce a Bill for the establishment of a\r\nnational system of Labour Exchanges. There is high authority for this\r\nproposal. The Majority and Minority representatives of the Poor Law\r\nCommission, differing in so much else, are agreed unanimously in its\r\nsupport. \"In the forefront of our proposals,\" says the Majority\r\nReport, \"we place Labour Exchanges.\" \"This National Labour Exchange,\"\r\nsays the Minority Report, \"though in itself no adequate remedy, is the\r\nfoundation of all our proposals. It is, in our view, an indispensable\r\ncondition of any real reform.\" The National Conference of Trade Union\r\nDelegates, convened by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union\r\nCongress, of March 19, 1909, resolved unanimously: \"That this\r\nConference of Trade Union delegates, representing 1,400,000 members,\r\napproves of the establishment of Labour Exchanges on a national basis,\r\nunder the control of the Board of Trade, provided that the managing\r\nboard contains at least an equal proportion of employers and\r\nrepresentatives of Trade Unions.\" The Central Unemployed Body for\r\nLondon, by a Resolution in June 1908, declared in favour of a national\r\nsystem of Labour Exchanges. Economists as divergent in opinion as\r\nProfessor Ashley, of Birmingham, and Professor Chapman, of Manchester,\r\nhave all approved and urged the project publicly in the strongest\r\nterms. Several of the principal members of the late Government have,\r\neither in evidence before the Poor Law Commission or in public\r\nspeeches, expressed themselves in favour of Labour Exchanges, and the\r\nReport of the delegates of the Labour Party to Germany strongly\r\napproves of the system which they found there, namely: \"the\r\nco-ordination and systematic management of Public Labour Exchanges.\"\r\n\r\nThe British authorities which I have mentioned are reinforced by the\r\nexample of many foreign countries; and as early as 1904 the Board of\r\nTrade, in its reports on agencies and methods of dealing with\r\nunemployed in foreign countries, drew attention to the very\r\nconsiderable extension of Labour Exchanges in the last three years in\r\nGermany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and Belgium. Since then Norway\r\nhas been added to the list. Mr. W. Bliss, in the Bulletin of the\r\n_Washington Bureau of Labour_ for May, 1908, in the course of a survey\r\nof the whole field of unemployment and of possible remedies, says,\r\n\"The most important agencies for providing work for the unemployed\r\nwho are employable, but have no prospect of returning to their former\r\npositions, are the public employment bureaux. These are largely\r\ndeveloped in a number of European countries, and especially in\r\nGermany, where they have grown rapidly in the last twenty years, both\r\nin numbers and in efficiency.\" So that the House will see that we have\r\nbehind us this afternoon not only a practical consensus of opinion\r\namong authorities at home in favour of the policy, but the spectacle\r\nof its successful practice on an extensive scale, and over a period of\r\nyears, in the greatest industrial community of the Continent, and its\r\nextension in various degrees to many other countries.\r\n\r\nI do not, therefore, propose to occupy the time of the House with any\r\nelaborate justification of the merits of the Bill. Those we may\r\ndiscuss at our leisure later. I confine myself only to a few general\r\nobservations. Two main defects in modern industrial conditions which\r\nwere emphasised by the Royal Commission were the lack of mobility of\r\nlabour and lack of information. With both of these defects the\r\nNational System of Labour Exchanges is calculated to deal. Modern\r\nindustry has become national. Fresh means of transport knit the\r\ncountry into one, as it was never knit before. Labour alone in its\r\nsearch for markets has not profited; the antiquated, wasteful, and\r\ndemoralising method of personal application--that is to say, the\r\nhawking of labour--persists. Labour Exchanges will give labour for the\r\nfirst time a modernised market. Labour Exchanges, in the second place,\r\nwill increase and will organise the mobility of labour. But let me\r\npoint out that to increase the _mobility_ of labour is not necessarily\r\nto increase the _movement_ of labour. Labour Exchanges will not\r\nincrease the movement of labour; they will only render that movement,\r\nwhen it has become necessary, more easy, more smooth, more painless,\r\nand less wasteful.\r\n\r\nLabour Exchanges do not pretend to any large extent to create new\r\nemployment. Their main function will be to organise the existing\r\nemployment, and by organising the existing employment to reduce the\r\nfriction and wastage, resulting from changes in employment and the\r\nmovement of workers, to a minimum. By so doing they will necessarily\r\nraise the general economic standard of our industrial life.\r\n\r\nSo far as the second defect, \"lack of information,\" is concerned, a\r\nsystem of Labour Exchanges promises to be of the highest value. In\r\nproportion as they are used, they will give absolutely contemporary\r\ninformation upon the tendencies of the demand for labour, both in\r\nquality and in quantity, as between one trade and another, as between\r\none season and another, as between one cycle and another, and as\r\nbetween one part of the country and another. They will tell the worker\r\nwhere to go for employment. They will tell him, what is scarcely less\r\nimportant, where it is useless to go in search of employment. Properly\r\nco-ordinated and connected with the employment bureaux of the various\r\neducation authorities, which are now coming into existence in Scotland\r\nand in England, they will afford an increasing means of guiding the\r\nnew generation into suitable, promising, and permanent employment, and\r\nwill divert them from overstocked or declining industries. They will\r\nput an end to that portion of unemployment that is merely local or\r\naccidental in character. They are the only means of grappling with the\r\nevils of casual employment, with all its demoralising consequences.\r\nThey are capable of aiding the process of dovetailing one seasonal\r\ntrade into another. A system of Labour Exchanges, dispensing with the\r\nneed for wandering in search of work, will make it possible, for the\r\nfirst time, to deal stringently with vagrancy. And, lastly, Labour\r\nExchanges are indispensable to any system of Unemployment Insurance,\r\nas indeed to any other type of honourable assistance to the\r\nunemployed, since they alone can provide an adequate test of the\r\ndesire for work and of the reality of unemployment. The authority of\r\nboth Reports of the Poor Law Commission may be cited upon these\r\npoints; and I shall present this Bill to the House as an important\r\npiece of social and industrial machinery, the need for which has long\r\nbeen apparent, and the want of which has been widely and painfully\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nI said that in the creation of such a system we may profit by the\r\nexample of Germany; we may do more, we may improve upon the example of\r\nGermany. The German Exchanges, though co-ordinated and encouraged to\r\nsome extent by State and Imperial Governments, are mainly municipal in\r\ntheir scope. Starting here with practically a clear field and with\r\nthe advantage of the experiment and the experience of other lands to\r\nguide us, we may begin upon a higher level and upon a larger scale.\r\nThere is reason to believe that the utility of a system like Labour\r\nExchanges, like utility of any other market, increases in proportion\r\nto its range and scope. We therefore propose, as a first principle,\r\nthat our system shall be uniform and national in its character; and\r\nhere, again, we are supported both by the Minority and by the Majority\r\nReports of the Royal Commission.\r\n\r\nA Departmental Committee at the Board of Trade has, during the last\r\nsix months, been working out the scheme in close detail. The whole\r\ncountry will be divided into ten or twelve principal divisions, each\r\nwith a Divisional Clearing House, and each under a Divisional Chief,\r\nall co-ordinated with the National Clearing House in London.\r\nDistributed among these 10 Divisions in towns of, let us say, 100,000\r\nor upwards will be between 30 and 40 First-class Labour Exchanges; in\r\ntowns of 50,000 to 100,000 between 40 and 50 Second-class Exchanges;\r\nand about 150 minor offices, consisting of Third-class Exchanges,\r\nSub-Offices, and Waiting-rooms, which last will be specially used in\r\nconnection with Dock decasualisation.\r\n\r\nThe control and direction of the whole system will be under the Board\r\nof Trade. But in order to secure absolute impartiality as between the\r\ninterests of capital and labour, Joint Advisory Committees, to contain\r\nin equal numbers representatives of employers and work-people, will be\r\nestablished in the principal centres. Thus we shall apply to the local\r\nmanagement of Labour Exchanges the same principle of parity of\r\nrepresentation between workmen and employers under impartial guidance\r\nand chairmanship, that we have adopted in the administration of the\r\nTrade Boards Bill, and that, _mutatis mutandis_, is the governing\r\nfeature of the Courts of Arbitration which have recently been set up.\r\nIf this Bill should obtain the assent of Parliament without undue\r\ndelay, I should hope to bring the system into simultaneous operation\r\nover the whole country, so far as practicable, in the early months of\r\nnext year. Temporary premises will be procured in all cases in the\r\nfirst instance; but a programme of building has been prepared, which\r\nin ten years will by a gradual process enable in all the principal\r\ncentres these temporary premises to be replaced by permanent\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThe expense of this system will no doubt be considerable. Its ordinary\r\nworking will not need a sum less than about L170,000 per year, and\r\nduring the period when the building is going on the expenditure will\r\nrise to about L200,000 per year.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the Labour Exchanges will become industrial centres in\r\neach town. We hope they will become the labour market. They may, where\r\nnecessary, provide an office where the Trade Board, if there is one,\r\nwill hold its meetings. We desire to co-operate with trade unions on\r\ncordial terms, while preserving strict impartiality between capital\r\nand labour in disputed matters. It may, for instance, be possible for\r\ntrade unions to keep their vacant-book in some cases at the exchanges.\r\nThe structure of those Exchanges may in some cases be such as to\r\nenable us to have rooms which can be let to trade unions at a rent,\r\nfor benefit and other meetings, so as to avoid the necessity under\r\nwhich all but the strongest unions lie at the present time of\r\nconducting their meetings in licensed premises. The Exchanges may, as\r\nthey develop, afford facilities for washing, clothes-mending, and for\r\nnon-alcoholic refreshments to persons who are attending them. Separate\r\nprovision will be made for men and for women, and for skilled and for\r\nunskilled labour. Boy labour will be dealt with in conjunction with\r\nthe local Education Authorities; and travelling expenses may be\r\nadvanced on loan, if the management of the Exchange think fit, to\r\npersons for whom situations have been found.\r\n\r\nSo much for the policy of Labour Exchanges. That is a policy complete\r\nin itself. It would be considerable if it stood alone; but it does not\r\nstand alone. As my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nhas announced in his Budget speech, the Government propose to\r\nassociate with the policy of Labour Exchanges a system of Unemployment\r\nInsurance.\r\n\r\nThe House knows that the Minority Report advocates a system of\r\ncompulsory labour exchanges, that no person shall engage any man for\r\nless than a month except through a Labour Exchange. That is not the\r\nproposal we are making. We are making a proposal of voluntary Labour\r\nExchanges. I am quite ready to admit that no system of voluntary\r\nLabour Exchanges can deal adequately with the evils and difficulties\r\nof casual labour; but there is one conclusive reason against\r\ncompulsory Labour Exchanges at the present time. To establish a\r\nsystem of compulsory Labour Exchanges in order to eliminate casual\r\nlabour, and so to divide among a certain proportion of workers all\r\navailable employment, would be absolutely and totally to cast out at\r\nthe other end a surplus of unemployed: and to do this before\r\npreparations have been made for dealing with that surplus, would be to\r\ncourt an administrative breakdown which could not fail to be attended\r\nwith the gravest possible disaster. Until poor law reform has made\r\nfurther progress, to establish a compulsory system of Labour Exchanges\r\nwould only increase and not diminish the miseries with which we are\r\nseeking to cope.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, decided that our system of labour exchanges shall\r\nbe voluntary in its character. For that very reason there is a great\r\ndanger, to which I have never shut my eyes, that the highest ranks of\r\nlabour, skilled workers, members of strong trade unions, would not\r\nthink it necessary to use the Exchanges, but would use the very\r\nexcellent apparatus which they have established themselves; that\r\ntherefore this expensive system of Exchanges which we are calling into\r\nbeing would come to be used only by the poorest of the workers in the\r\nlabour market, and, consequently, would gradually relapse and fall\r\nback into the purely distress machinery and non-economic machinery\r\nfrom which we are labouring to extricate and separate it. It is for\r\nthat reason, quite apart from the merits of the scheme of unemployment\r\ninsurance, that the Government are very anxious to associate with\r\ntheir system of Labour Exchanges a system of unemployed insurance. If\r\nLabour Exchanges depend for their effective initiation and\r\nestablishment upon unemployment insurance being associated with them,\r\nit is equally true to say that no scheme of unemployment insurance can\r\nbe worked except in conjunction with some apparatus for finding work\r\nand testing willingness to work, like Labour Exchanges. The two\r\nsystems are complementary; they are man and wife; they mutually\r\nsupport and sustain each other.\r\n\r\nSo I come to Unemployment Insurance. It is not practicable at the\r\npresent time to establish a universal system of unemployment\r\ninsurance. We, therefore, have to choose at the very outset of this\r\nsubject between insuring some workmen in all trades or all workmen in\r\nsome. In the first case we should have a voluntary, and in the second\r\na compulsory system. The risk of unemployment varies so much between\r\none man and another owing to relative skill, character, demeanour, and\r\nother qualities, that any system of State-aided voluntary insurance is\r\nutilised mainly by those most liable to be unemployed, and,\r\nconsequently, a preponderance of bad risks is established against the\r\nInsurance Office fatal to its financial stability. On the other hand,\r\na compulsory system of insurance, which did not add to the\r\ncontribution of the worker a substantial contribution from outside,\r\nwould almost certainly break down, because of the refusal of the\r\nhigher class of worker to assume, unsupported, a share of the burden\r\nof the weaker members of the community.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to adopt the second alternative, and our insurance\r\nsystem will, in consequence, be based upon four main principles. It\r\nwill involve contributions from workmen and employers; it will receive\r\na substantial subvention from the State; it will be organised by\r\ntrades; it will be compulsory upon all--employers and employed,\r\nskilled and unskilled, unionists and non-unionists alike--within\r\nthose trades. The hon. Member for Leicester[15] with great force\r\nshowed that to confine a scheme of unemployment insurance merely to\r\ntrade unionists would be trifling with the subject. It would only be\r\naiding those who have, thank God, been most able to aid themselves,\r\nwithout at the same time assisting those who hitherto, under existing\r\nconditions, have not been able to make any effective provision.\r\n\r\nTo what trades ought we, as a beginning, to apply this system of\r\ncompulsory contributory unemployment insurance? There is a group of\r\ntrades specially marked out for the operation of such a policy. They\r\nare trades in which unemployment is not only high, but chronic, for\r\neven in the best of times it persists; in which it is not only high\r\nand chronic, but marked by seasonal and cyclical fluctuations, and in\r\nwhich, wherever and howsoever it occurs, it takes the form not of\r\nshort time or of any of those devices for spreading wages and\r\nequalising or averaging risks, but of a total, absolute, periodical\r\ndischarge of a certain proportion of the workers. The group of trades\r\nwhich we contemplate to be the subject of our scheme are these:\r\nhouse-building, and works of construction, engineering, machine-and\r\ntool-making, ship-building and boat-building, making of vehicles, and\r\nmill-sawing.\r\n\r\nThat is a very considerable group of industries. They comprise,\r\nprobably at the present time, 21/4 millions of adult males. Two and a\r\nquarter millions of adult males are, roughly speaking, one-third of\r\nthe population of these three kingdoms engaged in purely industrial\r\nwork; that is to say, excluding commercial, professional,\r\nagricultural, and domestic occupations. Of the remaining two-thirds of\r\nthe industrial population, nearly one-half are employed in the textile\r\ntrades, in mining, on the railways, in the merchant marine, and in\r\nother trades, which either do not present the same features of\r\nunemployment which we see in these precarious trades, or which, by the\r\nadoption of short time or other arrangements, avoid the total\r\ndischarge of a proportion of workmen from time to time. So that this\r\ngroup of trades to which we propose to apply the system of\r\nunemployment insurance, roughly speaking, covers very nearly half of\r\nthe whole field of unemployment; and that half is, on the whole,\r\nperhaps the worse half.\r\n\r\nThe financial and actuarial basis of the scheme has been very\r\ncarefully studied by the light of all available information. The\r\nreport of the actuarial authorities whom I have consulted leaves me in\r\nno doubt that, even after all allowance has been made for the fact\r\nthat unemployment may be more rife in the less organised and less\r\nhighly skilled trades than in the trade unions who pay unemployment\r\nbenefits--which is by no means certain--there is no doubt whatever\r\nthat a financially sound scheme can be evolved which, in return for\r\nmoderate contributions, will yield adequate benefits. I do not at this\r\nstage propose to offer any figures of contributions or benefits to the\r\nHouse. I confine myself to stating that we propose to aim at a scale\r\nof benefits which would be somewhat lower both in amount and in\r\nduration of payments, than that which the best-organised trade unions\r\nprovide for their own members, but which, at the same time, should\r\nafford a substantial weekly payment extending over by far the greater\r\npart of the average period of unemployment of all unemployed persons\r\nin these trades.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable such a scale of benefits to be paid, we should have\r\nto raise a total sum of something between 5d. and 6d. per week per\r\nhead, and this sum will be met by contributions, not necessarily\r\nequal, from the State, the workman, and the employer. For such\r\nsacrifices, which are certainly not extortionate, and which, fairly\r\nadjusted, will not hamper industry nor burden labour, nor cause an\r\nundue strain on public finance, we believe it possible to relieve a\r\nvast portion of our industrial population from a haunting and constant\r\nperil which gnaws the very heart of their prosperity and contentment.\r\n\r\nThe House will see the connection of this to the Labour Exchanges. The\r\nmachinery of the insurance scheme has been closely studied, and, as at\r\npresent advised, we should propose to follow the example of Germany in\r\nrespect of Insurance Cards or Books, to which stamps will be affixed\r\nweek by week. When a worker in an insured trade loses his employment,\r\nall he will have to do is to take his card to the Labour Exchange,\r\nwhich, working in conjunction with the Insurance Office, will find him\r\na job or pay him his benefit.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the whole scheme of insurance to the present voluntary\r\nefforts of trade unions requires, and will receive, the most anxious\r\nconsideration, and I am in hopes that we shall be able to make\r\nproposals which would absolutely safeguard trade unions from the\r\nunfair competition of a national insurance fund, and will indeed act\r\nas a powerful encouragement to voluntary organisations which are\r\nproviding unemployed benefit.\r\n\r\nI have thought it right to submit these not inconsiderable proposals\r\nin general outline to the House of Commons at this early stage, in\r\norder that the proposals for Labour Exchanges which we are now putting\r\nforward may be properly understood, and may not be underrated or\r\nmisjudged. We cannot bring the system of unemployment insurance before\r\nParliament in a legislative form this year for five reasons: We have\r\nnot now got the time; we have not yet got the money; the finance of\r\nsuch a system has to be adjusted and co-ordinated with the finance of\r\nthe other insurance schemes upon which the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nis engaged; the establishment of a system of Labour Exchanges is the\r\nnecessary forerunner and foundation of a system of insurance; and,\r\nlastly, no such novel departure as unemployment insurance could\r\npossibly be taken without much further consultation and negotiation\r\nwith the trade unions and employers specially concerned than the\r\nconditions of secrecy under which we have been working have yet\r\nallowed. This business of conference and consultation of the fullest\r\ncharacter will occupy the winter, when the Board of Trade will confer\r\nwith all parties affected, so that the greatest measure of agreement\r\nmay be secured for our proposals when they are next year presented in\r\ntheir final form.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary for me to add that the pressure and prospect of\r\nthese heavy duties have required me to make a re-arrangement of the\r\nLabour Department of the Board of Trade. I propose to divide it into\r\nthree sections. The first will be concerned with Wages questions and\r\nTrade disputes, with Arbitration, Conciliation, and with the working\r\nof the Trade Boards Bill, should it become law; the second, with\r\nStatistics, the Census of Production, Special Inquiries, and _The\r\nLabour Gazette_; and the third, with Labour Exchanges and Unemployment\r\nInsurance.\r\n\r\nOne of the functions of the last section will be to act as a kind of\r\nintelligence bureau, watching the continual changes of the labour\r\nmarket here and abroad, and suggesting any measure which may be\r\npracticable, such as co-ordination and distribution of Government\r\ncontracts and municipal work, so as to act as a counterpoise to the\r\nmovement of the ordinary labour market, and it will also, we trust, be\r\nable to conduct examinations of schemes of public utility, so that\r\nsuch schemes can, if decided upon by the Government and the Treasury,\r\nbe set on foot at any time with knowledge and forethought, instead of\r\nthe haphazard, hand-to-mouth manner with which we try to deal with\r\nthese emergencies at the present time.\r\n\r\nSuch are the proposals which we submit in regard to the organisation\r\nsection of this problem. I have carefully confined myself to that\r\nsection. I have not trespassed at all upon the other no less important\r\nor scarcely less important branches, and I am quite certain this\r\nParliament will gladly devote whatever strength it possesses to\r\nattempting to grapple with these hideous problems of social chaos,\r\nwhich are marring the contentment and honour of our country, and\r\nwhich, neglected, may fatally affect its life and its strength.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Mr. Ramsay MacDonald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET RESOLUTIONS (May 4, 1909)                     277\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET AND NATIONAL INSURANCE (May 23, 1909)         297\r\n\r\nTHE LAND AND INCOME TAXES (July 17, 1909)                318\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET AND THE LORDS (July 26, 1909)                 344\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE BUDGET (Sept. 5, 1909)                 357\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET AND PROPERTY (Oct. 7, 1909)                   384\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL MENACE (Oct. 9, 1909)                 405\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET RESOLUTIONS\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _May 4, 1903_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leader of the Opposition this afternoon told us that we were at\r\nthe beginning of what would be a very complex and a very protracted\r\ndiscussion. If that discussion continues as it has begun, the\r\nGovernment will have no reason to complain of it. We have made\r\nextensive and even daring proposals. Those proposals have been\r\naccepted and, on the whole, even acclaimed by the public at large, and\r\nthey have not been substantially challenged in this House. The Leader\r\nof the Opposition, it is true, devoted his reasoned and temperate\r\nspeech to making a careful inquiry into the foundations and the\r\ncharacter of certain of the taxes by which my right hon. friend\r\nproposes to raise the revenue for the year; and I gathered he\r\naccepted, with such reservations as are proper to all engaged in a\r\nlarge discussion, and as are particularly appropriate to a Party\r\nleader, the general principle of differentiation of taxation in regard\r\nto the amount of property, but that he demurred to and condemned\r\ndifferentiation in regard to the character of property. The right hon.\r\ngentleman singled out for special censure and animadversion the two\r\nsets of taxes in relation to land and to the licensed trade. He used\r\nan expression about some of the forms of taxation proposed by the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer which was a striking one. He said that\r\nthey diverged from the principles which have hitherto dominated\r\ncivilised society.\r\n\r\nEven at the risk of that accusation we on this side of the House have\r\nalways taken and will always assert an entirely different position in\r\nregard to the taxation of land and of liquor licences from that of the\r\ntaxation of other classes of property. The immemorial custom of nearly\r\nevery modern State, the mature conclusions of many of the greatest\r\nthinkers, have placed the tenure, transfer, and obligations of land in\r\na wholly different category from other classes of property. The mere\r\nobvious physical distinction between land, which is a vital necessity\r\nof every human being and which at the same time is strictly limited\r\nin extent, and other property is in itself sufficient to justify a\r\nclear differentiation in its treatment, and in the view taken by the\r\nState of the conditions which should govern the tenure of land from\r\nthat which should regulate traffic in other forms of property. When\r\nthe right hon. gentleman seeks by comparisons to show that the same\r\nreasoning which has been applied to land ought also in logic and by\r\nevery argument of symmetry to be applied to the unearned increment\r\nderived from other processes which are at work in our modern\r\ncivilisation, he only shows by each example he takes how different are\r\nthe conditions which attach to the possession of land and speculation\r\nin the value of land from those which attach to other forms of\r\nbusiness speculation.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" he inquires, \"you tax the unearned increment on land, why don't\r\nyou tax the unearned increment from a large block of stocks? I buy a\r\npiece of land; the value rises; I buy stocks; their value rises.\" But\r\nthe operations are entirely dissimilar. In the first speculation the\r\nunearned increment derived from land arises from a wholly sterile\r\nprocess, from the mere withholding of a commodity which is needed by\r\nthe community. In the second case, the investor in a block of shares\r\ndoes not withhold from the community what the community needs. The one\r\noperation is in restraint of trade and in conflict with the general\r\ninterest, and the other is part of a natural and healthy process, by\r\nwhich the economic plant of the world is nourished and from year to\r\nyear successfully and notably increased.\r\n\r\nThen the right hon. gentleman instanced the case of a new railway and\r\na country district enriched by that railway. The railway, he\r\nexplained, is built to open up a new district; and the farmers and\r\nlandowners in that district are endowed with unearned increment in\r\nconsequence of the building of the railway. But if after a while their\r\nbusiness aptitude and industry creates a large carrying trade, then\r\nthe railway, he contends, gets its unearned increment in its turn. But\r\nthe right hon. gentleman cannot call the increment unearned which the\r\nrailway acquires through the regular service of carrying goods,\r\nrendering a service on each occasion in proportion to the tonnage of\r\ngoods it carries, making a profit by an active extension of the scale\r\nof its useful business--he cannot surely compare that process with\r\nthe process of getting rich merely by sitting still. It is clear that\r\nthe analogy is not true.\r\n\r\nWe are further told that the Budget proposals proceed on the\r\nassumption that there is a corner in land, and that communities are\r\ndenied the opportunity of getting the land required, whereas, it is\r\nasserted, there is in fact nothing approaching a corner in land. I do\r\nnot think the Leader of the Opposition could have chosen a more\r\nunfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the demand of that\r\ngreat community for land was for not more than forty acres a year. Is\r\nthat the only demand of the people of Glasgow for land? Does that\r\nreally represent the complete economic and natural demand for the\r\namount of land a population of that size requires to live on? I will\r\nadmit that at present prices it may be all that they can afford to\r\npurchase in the course of a year. But there are one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand persons in Glasgow who are living in one-room tenements; and\r\nwe are told that the utmost land those people can absorb economically\r\nand naturally is forty acres a year. What is the explanation? Because\r\nthe population is congested in the city the price of land is high upon\r\nthe suburbs, and because the price of land is high upon the suburbs\r\nthe population must remain congested within the city. That is the\r\nposition which we are complacently assured is in accordance with the\r\nprinciples which have hitherto dominated civilised society.\r\n\r\nBut when we seek to rectify this system, to break down this unnatural\r\nand vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of unsatisfactory\r\nreactions, what happens? We are not confronted with any great argument\r\non behalf of the owner. Something else is put forward, and it is\r\nalways put forward in these cases to shield the actual landowner or\r\nthe actual capitalist from the logic of the argument or from the force\r\nof a Parliamentary movement. Sometimes it is the widow. But that\r\npersonality has been used to exhaustion. It would be sweating in the\r\ncruellest sense of the word, overtime of the grossest description, to\r\nbring the widow out again so soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so\r\ninstead of the widow we have the market-gardener--the market-gardener\r\nliable to be disturbed on the outskirts of great cities, if the\r\npopulation of those cities expands, if the area which they require for\r\ntheir health and daily life should become larger than it is at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nI should like to point out to the Committee that the right hon.\r\ngentleman, in using this argument about the market-gardener,\r\nrecognises very clearly--and I think beyond the possibility of a\r\nwithdrawal--the possibility of these cities expanding and taking up a\r\nlarger area of ground in consequence of the kind of taxation which my\r\nright hon. friend in his land taxes seeks to impose. But let that\r\npass. What is the position disclosed by the argument? On the one hand\r\nwe have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying\r\none-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the\r\ntwo stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the\r\nsake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested\r\nwithin limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply of\r\nland which can bear no relation whatever to their physical, social,\r\nand economic needs--and all for the sake of the market-gardener, who\r\ncan perfectly well move farther out as the city spreads, and who would\r\nnot really be in the least injured.\r\n\r\nWe take the view that land cannot be regarded as an ordinary\r\ncommodity, nor are we prepared to place publicans' licences in the\r\nsame position as ordinary property. A licence is a gift from the\r\nState, and the licensed trade is subject to special restrictions and\r\nspecial taxation; this has been recognised by all parties and by all\r\nGovernments. The position in regard to licences, as we know perfectly\r\nwell, has been sensibly and, indeed, entirely altered in the course of\r\nthe last few years. We have seen the assertion on the part of the\r\nlicensed trade of their right to convert their annual tenancy of a\r\nlicence from what it has been understood to be, to a freehold, and in\r\nthat position they must face the logical consequences of the arguments\r\nthey have used and of their action. If there are any hardships to them\r\nin the taxation proposed, let the hardships be exposed to Parliament\r\nand they will be considered in no spirit of prejudice or malice. Do\r\nnot, however, let us have attempts to represent that the tax which\r\ninvolves an increase in the cost of production extinguishes the\r\nprofits of the industry. It does not necessarily affect the profits of\r\nthe industry; it is not a deduction from resultant profits; it is an\r\nincident in the turnover. If there are hard cases and special\r\ninstances, we are prepared to meet them with the closest attention and\r\nwith a desire to avoid severity or anything like the appearance of\r\nharsh treatment of individuals. But we decline to regard licences or\r\nland on the same footing as ordinary property. Licences are not to be\r\nregarded as ordinary private property, but as public property which\r\nought never to have been alienated from the State.\r\n\r\nNo one will deny that we are making very considerable proposals to\r\nParliament for the finance of the year; but the Conservative Party\r\nhave gravely compromised their power of resistance. Those who desire\r\nto see armaments restricted to the minimum consistent with national\r\nsecurity, those who labour to combat the scares of war, and to show\r\nhow many alarms have no foundation,--those are not ill-situated, if\r\nthey choose to make criticisms on the scale and scope of the finance\r\nrequired for the year's expenditure. But an Opposition that day after\r\nday exposes the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Prime Minister to\r\na rain of questions and cross-questions, the only object of which, or\r\nan important object of which, is to promote a feeling of insecurity,\r\ninvolving demands for new expenditure of an almost indefinite\r\ncharacter, those who, like the right hon. Member for Dover,[16] hurry\r\nto and fro in the land saying--or was it singing?--\"We want eight, and\r\nwe won't wait\"--they, at least, are not in the best position to tell\r\nthe taxpayer to call on some one else. Surely a reputation for\r\npatriotism would be cheaply gained by clamouring for ships that are\r\nnot needed, to be paid for with money that is to come from other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere is another set of arguments to which I should like to refer. We\r\nhave been long told that this Budget would reveal the bankruptcy of\r\nfree-trade finance, and the Leader of the Opposition, seeking from\r\ntime to time for a sound economic foothold in the fiscal quicksands in\r\nwhich he is being engulfed, has endeavoured to rest the sole of his\r\nfoot on tariff for revenue. The adoption of a policy of tariff reform,\r\nwe have been told, had become absolutely necessary if the revenue of\r\nthe country was to be obtained and if a natural expansion were to be\r\nimparted to it. But now, if we may judge from the newspapers, one of\r\nthe complaints made against the free-trade system and the free-trade\r\nBudget of my right hon. friend is not that the revenue will expand too\r\nlittle, but that there is the possibility that it will expand too\r\nmuch. It is not that we have reached the limits of practicable\r\nfree-trade taxation, but that the taxation we now ask Parliament to\r\nassent to, will yield in the second year a much more abundant return\r\nthan in the first year, and that in subsequent years the yield will\r\nincrease still further. In the words of _The Times_ newspaper: \"The\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer has laid broad and deep the basis of\r\nfurther revenue for future years.\"\r\n\r\nThose who lately taunted us with being arrested by a dead wall of\r\nCobdenite principles are now bewailing that we have opened up broad\r\navenues of financial advance. They came to bewail the deficit of this\r\nyear: they remained to censure the surplus of next. We may, no doubt,\r\nin the future hear arguments of how protection will revive industry\r\nand increase employment, as we have heard them in the past; but there\r\nis one argument which I should think it unlikely would be effectively\r\nused against us in the future, and that is that a free-trade system\r\ncannot produce revenue, because one of the criticisms which is\r\nemphatically directed against this Budget is on account of that very\r\nexpansiveness of revenue which it was lately declared a free-trade\r\nsystem never could produce.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the only vindication of free-trade finance which is at\r\nhand. How have foreign countries stood the late depression in trade?\r\nThe shortfall of the revenue from the estimates in this country was\r\nlast year less than two millions, in Germany it was eight millions,\r\nand in the United States over nineteen millions. Let the House see\r\nwhat fair-weather friends these protectionist duties are. In times of\r\ndepression they shrink. In times of war they may fail utterly. When\r\nthey are wanted, they dwindle, when they are wanted most urgently,\r\nthey fade and die away altogether.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of the taxation of manufactured articles as a\r\nfoundation for any fiscal policy is true still more of the taxation of\r\nfood, and of no country is it so true as of this island. For if you\r\nwere ever engaged in a war which rendered the highways of the ocean\r\ninsecure the rise in prices would be such that all food taxes would\r\nhave to be swept away at once by any Government which desired to use\r\nthe whole vigour of its people in prosecuting the war. This year, with\r\nits trade depression and its excellent maintenance of the revenue,\r\nhas seen the vindication of free trade as a revenue-producing\r\ninstrument; next year will see its triumph.\r\n\r\nI have no apprehensions about the Budget which is now before the\r\nCommittee. As Mr. Gladstone said, in introducing the Reform Bill of\r\n1884, what is wanted to carry this measure is concentration and\r\nconcentration only, and what will lose this measure is division and\r\ndivision only. And I venture to think that it will not only be a\r\ndemonstration of the soundness of the economic fiscal policy we have\r\nlong followed, but it will also be a demonstration of the fiscal and\r\nfinancial strength of Great Britain which will not be without its use\r\nand value upon the diplomatic and perhaps even upon the naval\r\nsituation in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe right honourable Member for East Worcestershire[17] said this\r\nBudget was the work of several sessions, if not indeed of several\r\nParliaments. The statement is exaggerated. The proposals outlined do\r\nnot in any degree transcend the limits of the practical. A social\r\npolicy may be very large, but at the same time it may be very simple.\r\nAll these projects of economic development, of labour exchanges, of\r\ninsurance for invalidity, and unemployment, which depend on money\r\ngrants, may require very careful and elaborate administrative\r\nadjustment; but so far as Parliament is concerned they do not impose\r\ndifficulties or make demands upon the time of the House in any way\r\ncomparable to those which are excited by the passage of an Education\r\nor a Licensing Bill, and I see no reason whatever why we should not\r\nanticipate that in the course of this session and next session we\r\nshould be able to establish a wide and general system of national\r\ninsurance, which, more than any other device within the reach of this\r\ngeneration of the workers of our country, will help to hold off from\r\nthem some of the most fatal and most cruel perils which smash their\r\nhouseholds and ruin the lives of families and of workmen.\r\n\r\nOn many grounds we may commend this Budget to the House. It makes\r\nprovision for the present. It makes greater provision for the future.\r\nIndirect taxation reaches the minimum. Food taxation reaches the\r\nminimum since the South African war. Certainly the working classes\r\nhave no reason to complain. Nothing in the Budget touches the\r\nphysical efficiency and energy of labour. Nothing in it touches the\r\neconomy of the cottage home. Middle-class people with between L300 and\r\nL2,000 a year are not affected in any considerable degree, except by\r\nthe estate duties, and in that not to a large extent, while in some\r\ncases they are distinctly benefited in the general way of taxation.\r\nThe very rich are not singled out for peculiar, special, or invidious\r\nforms of imposition.\r\n\r\nThe chief burden of the increase of taxation is placed upon the main\r\nbody of the wealthy classes in this country, a class which in number\r\nand in wealth is much greater than in any other equal community, if\r\nnot, indeed, in any other modern State in the whole world; and that is\r\na class which, in opportunities of pleasure, in all the amenities of\r\nlife, and in freedom from penalties, obligations, and dangers, is more\r\nfortunate than any other equally numerous class of citizens in any age\r\nor in any country. That class has more to gain than any other class of\r\nhis Majesty's subjects from dwelling amid a healthy and contented\r\npeople, and in a safely guarded land.\r\n\r\nI do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition, that they will meet\r\nthe charges which are placed upon them for the needs of this year by\r\nevasion and fraud, and by cutting down the charities which their good\r\nfeelings have prompted them to dispense. The man who proposes to meet\r\ntaxation by cutting down his charities, is not the sort of man who is\r\nlikely to find any very extensive source of economy in the charities\r\nwhich he has hitherto given. As for evasion, I hope the right hon.\r\ngentleman and his supporters underrate the public spirit which\r\nanimates a proportion at any rate of the class which would be most\r\nnotably affected by the present taxation. And there is for their\r\nconsolation one great assurance which is worth much more to them than\r\na few millions, more or less, of taxation. It is this--that we are\r\nthis year taking all that we are likely to need for the policy which\r\nis now placed before the country, and which will absorb the energies\r\nof this Parliament. And, so far as this Parliament is concerned, it is\r\nextremely unlikely, in the absence of a national calamity, that any\r\nfurther demand will be made upon them, or that the shifting and vague\r\nshadows of another impending Budget will darken the prospects of\r\nimproving trade.\r\n\r\nWhen all that may be said on these grounds has been said, we do not\r\nattempt to deny that the Budget raises some of the fundamental issues\r\nwhich divide the historic Parties in British politics. We do not want\r\nto embitter those issues, but neither do we wish to conceal them. We\r\nknow that hon. gentlemen opposite believe that the revenue of the\r\ncountry could be better raised by a protective tariff. We are\r\nconfident that a free-trade system alone would stand the strain of\r\nmodern needs and yield the expansive power which is necessary at the\r\npresent time in the revenue. And our proof shall be the swift\r\naccomplishment of the fact. The right hon. gentleman opposite and his\r\nfriends seek to arrest the tendency to decrease the proportion of\r\nindirect to direct taxation which has marked, in unbroken continuity,\r\nthe course of the last sixty years. We, on the other hand, regard that\r\ntendency as of deep-seated social significance, and we are resolved\r\nthat it shall not be arrested. So far as we are concerned, we are\r\nresolved that it shall continue until in the end the entire charge\r\nshall be defrayed from the profits of accumulated wealth and by the\r\ntaxation of those popular indulgences which cannot be said in any way\r\nto affect the physical efficiency of labour. The policy of the\r\nConservative Party is to multiply and extend the volume and variety of\r\ntaxes upon food and necessaries. They will repose themselves, not\r\nonly, as we are still forced to do, on tea and sugar, but upon bread\r\nand meat--not merely upon luxuries and comforts, but also on articles\r\nof prime necessity. Our policy is not to increase, but whenever\r\npossible to decrease, and ultimately to abolish altogether, taxes on\r\narticles of food and the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIf there is divergence between us in regard to the methods by which we\r\nare to raise our revenue, there is also divergence in regard to the\r\nobjects on which we are to spend them. We are, on both sides, inclined\r\nto agree that we are approaching, if we have not actually entered on,\r\none of the climacterics of our national life. We see new forces at\r\nwork in the world, and they are not all friendly forces. We see new\r\nconditions abroad and around us, and they are not all favourable\r\nconditions; and I think there is a great deal to be said for those who\r\non both sides of politics are urging that we should strive for a more\r\nearnest, more strenuous, more consciously national life. But there we\r\npart, because the Conservative Party are inclined too much to repose\r\ntheir faith for the future security and pre-eminence of this country\r\nupon naval and military preparations, and would sometimes have us\r\nbelieve that you can make this country secure and respected by the\r\nmere multiplication of ironclad ships. We shall not exclude that\r\nprovision, and now indeed ask the Committee to enable us to take the\r\nsteps to secure us that expansion of revenue which will place our\r\nfinancial resources beyond the capacity of any Power that we need to\r\ntake into consideration. But we take a broader view. We are not going\r\nto measure the strength of great countries only by their material\r\nresources. We think that the supremacy and predominance of our country\r\ndepend upon the maintenance of the vigour and health of its\r\npopulation, just as its true glory must always be found in the\r\nhappiness of its cottage homes. We believe that if Great Britain is to\r\nremain great and famous in the world, we cannot allow the present\r\nsocial and industrial disorders, with their profound physical and\r\nmoral reactions, to continue unchecked. We propose to you a financial\r\nscheme, but we also advance a policy of social organisation. It will\r\ndemand sacrifices from all classes; it will give security to all\r\nclasses. By its means we shall be able definitely to control some of\r\nthe most wasteful processes in our social life, and without it our\r\ncountry will remain exposed to vital dangers, against which fleets and\r\narmies are of no avail.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Mr. Wyndham.\r\n\r\n[17] Mr. Austen Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET AND NATIONAL INSURANCE\r\n\r\nTHE FREE TRADE HALL, MANCHESTER, _May 23, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Manchester Guardian_, by permission.)\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering that you have all been ruined by the Budget, I think it\r\nvery kind of you to receive me so well. When I remember all the\r\ninjuries you have suffered--how South Africa has been lost; how the\r\ngold mines have been thrown away; how all the splendid army which Mr.\r\nBrodrick got together has been reduced to a sham; and how, of course,\r\nwe have got no navy of any kind whatever, not even a fishing smack,\r\nfor the thirty-five millions a year we give the Admiralty; and when I\r\nremember that in spite of all these evils the taxes are so oppressive\r\nand so cruel that any self-respecting Conservative will tell you he\r\ncannot afford either to live or die, I think it remarkable that you\r\nshould be willing to give me such a hearty welcome back to Manchester.\r\nYes, sir, when I think of the colonies we have lost, of the Empire we\r\nhave alienated, of the food we have left untaxed, and the foreigners\r\nwe have left unmolested, and the ladies we have left outside, I\r\nconfess I am astonished to find you so glad to see me here again.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that our people are becoming hysterical, and that\r\nBritain is losing her old deep-seated sagacity for judging men and\r\nevents. That is not my view. I have been taught that the dock always\r\ngrows near the nettle. I am inclined to think that in a free community\r\nevery evil carries with it its own corrective, and so I believe that\r\nsensationalism of all kinds is playing itself out, and, overdoing, is\r\nitself undone. And the more our scaremongers cry havoc, and panic, and\r\nairships, and sea-serpents, and all the other things they see floating\r\naround, the greater is the composure and the greater is the contempt\r\nwith which the mass of the nation receives these revelations, and the\r\nmore ready they are to devote their mind to the large and serious\r\nproblems of national and social organisation which press for solution\r\nand for action at the present time, and upon which his Majesty's\r\nGovernment have notable proposals to make.\r\n\r\nI come to you this afternoon to speak about the political situation\r\nand the Budget, or rather I come to speak to you about the Budget,\r\nbecause the Budget is the political situation; and I ask you, as if it\r\nwere at an election, whether you will support the policy of the Budget\r\nor not. Let us look into it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the position in which we find ourselves? After reducing the\r\ntaxes on coal, on tea, on sugar, and on the smaller class of incomes\r\nby nearly L7,000,000 a year, and after paying back L40,000,000 of debt\r\nin three years, we find that new circumstances and new needs make it\r\nnecessary that we should obtain fresh revenue for the service of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nWhat are the reasons for this demand? There are three reasons--and\r\nonly three. Old-age pensions, the navy, and the decrease in the\r\nrevenue derived from alcoholic liquor. From those three causes we\r\nrequire sixteen millions more money this year than we did last year.\r\nNow who has a right--this is my first question--to reproach us for\r\nthat? Certainly the Conservative Party have no right.\r\n\r\nTake first the case of old-age pensions. I do not think their record\r\nis a very good one on that. They promised old-age pensions to win the\r\ngeneral election of 1895. They were in power for ten years and they\r\nmade no effort to redeem their pledge. Again, Mr. Chamberlain, in\r\n1903, promised old-age pensions as a part of his Tariff Reform\r\nproposal, but the Conservative Party refused to agree to the inclusion\r\nof old-age pensions in that programme and forced that great man in the\r\nheight of his power and his career to throw out old-age pensions from\r\nthe Tariff Reform programme and to write a letter to the newspapers to\r\nsay that he had done so.\r\n\r\nWe, the Liberal Party, did not promise old-age pensions at the\r\nelection of 1906. The subject was scarcely mentioned by any of the\r\ncandidates who are now your Members. Certainly it did not occupy at\r\nall a prominent position. We did not promise old-age pensions; we gave\r\nold-age pensions. When the Old-Age Pensions Bill was before the House\r\nof Commons, what was the attitude of the Conservative Party? Did they\r\ndo anything to try to reduce or control the expenditure of that great\r\ndeparture? On the contrary. As my right honourable friend the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer has told the House of Commons, amendments\r\nto the Old-Age Pensions Bill were moved or received the official\r\nsupport of the Whips of the Conservative Party which would have\r\nraised the cost of that scheme to fourteen millions a year. And the\r\nLiberal Government, which was making this great effort, which was\r\ndoing the work, which was keeping the Tory promise, was reproached and\r\nwas derided for not accepting the proposals which these irresponsible\r\nphilanthropists, these social reformers on the cheap, these\r\nlimited-liability politicians, were so ready to move. And Lord\r\nHalsbury, the late Lord Chancellor, one of the leaders of the\r\nConservative Party, a man with a powerful influence in their councils,\r\nsaid in a public speech that the old-age pensions as proposed by the\r\nGovernment were so paltry as to be almost a mockery.\r\n\r\nI do not think any fair-minded or impartial man, or any average\r\nBritish jury, surveying the record of the Conservative Party upon\r\nold-age pensions, could come to any other conclusion than that they\r\nhad used this question for popularity alone; that they never meant to\r\ngive old-age pensions; that they only meant to get votes by promising\r\nto give them; that they would have stopped them being given if they\r\ncould; that while the Bill was on its way they tried to embarrass the\r\nGovernment, and to push things to unpractical extremes; and now, even\r\nwhen the pensions have been given, they would not pay for them if they\r\ncould help it. Let me say that I think the conclusion, which I believe\r\nany jury would come to, would perhaps be rather harsh upon the\r\nConservative Party. I believe they meant better than their record; I\r\nam willing to admit that. But their record is before us, and it is a\r\nbad one, and upon the facts I have no hesitation in saying that it is\r\nnot open to them to protest--they have not even an inch of foothold to\r\nprotest--against any expenditure which we may now have to incur in\r\norder to defray the consequences of the policy of old-age pensions. So\r\nmuch for the first cause of the increased expenditure.\r\n\r\nI pass to the navy. The Naval Estimates have risen by three millions\r\nthis year. I regret it; but I am prepared to justify it. There will be\r\na further increase next year. I regret it; but within proper limits\r\nnecessary to secure national safety I shall be prepared to justify it;\r\nbut I hope you will not expect me to advocate a braggart and\r\nsensational policy of expenditure upon armaments. I have always been\r\nagainst that, as my father was before me.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, a Liberal is a man who ought to stand as a restraining\r\nforce against an extravagant policy. He is a man who ought to keep\r\ncool in the presence of Jingo clamour. He is a man who believes that\r\nconfidence between nations begets confidence, and that the spirit of\r\npeace and goodwill makes the safety it seeks. And, above all, I think\r\na Liberal is a man who should keep a sour look for scaremongers of\r\nevery kind and of every size, however distinguished, however\r\nridiculous--and sometimes the most distinguished are the most\r\nridiculous--a cold, chilling, sour look for all of them, whether their\r\npanic comes from the sea or from the air or from the earth or from the\r\nwaters under the earth.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's Government are resolved that the defensive measures of\r\nthis country shall be prescribed by the policy of Ministers\r\nresponsible to Parliament, and by the calculations, subject to that\r\npolicy, of the experts on whom those Ministers rely, and not by the\r\nfolly and the clamour of Party politicians or sensational journalists.\r\nIn that determination we as a Government are united, and we shall\r\nremain united. Yet it is clear that the increase in the Naval\r\nEstimates of this year must be followed by another increase in those\r\nof next year. That is deplorable. It will impose upon our finances a\r\nstrain which some other nations would not find it very easy to bear,\r\nbut which, if the necessity be proved, this country will not be\r\nunwilling, and will certainly not be unable to support.\r\n\r\nWell, but what have the Conservative Party got to say about it? Have\r\nthey any right to complain of the taxes which are necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of our naval power? Do we not see that they are ever\r\nexerting themselves to urge still greater expenditure upon the nation?\r\nHe is a poor sort of fellow, a penny-plain-twopence-coloured kind of\r\npatriot who goes about shouting for ships, and then grudges the money\r\nnecessary to build them. And when Mr. Balfour tells us that \"gigantic\r\nsacrifices\" are required, and that those gigantic sacrifices \"must\r\nbegin now,\" and then at the same time objects to the taxes by which\r\nthe Government proposes to raise the money, he puts himself in a very\r\nqueer position.\r\n\r\nI have dealt with two of the causes which have led to our demand for\r\nfurther revenue--old-age pensions and the navy. Upon neither of them\r\nhave the Conservative Party any ground for attacking us. What is the\r\nthird? Ah, gentlemen, I agree that there is one cause of the\r\nprospective deficit for which we are budgeting for which the\r\nConservative Party is in no way responsible. I mean the decline in the\r\nconsumption of alcoholic liquors. Nothing that they have said and\r\nnothing that they have done has, in intention or in fact, contributed\r\nto the drying up of that source of revenue. On the contrary, by their\r\nlegislation, by the views they have taken of the rights of the\r\nlicensed trade, by their resistance to every measure of temperance\r\nreform, by their refusal even to discuss in the House of Lords the\r\ngreat Licensing Bill of last year, by their association with the\r\nbrewers and with the liquor traffic generally, they have done all they\r\ncould--I do them the justice to admit it--to maintain the Customs and\r\nExcise from alcoholic liquors at the highest level. If the habits of\r\nthe people, under the influences of a wider culture, of variety, of\r\ncomfort, of brighter lives, and of new conceptions, have steadily\r\nundergone a beneficent elevation and amelioration, it has been in\r\nspite of every obstacle that wealth and rank and vested interest could\r\ninterpose.\r\n\r\nThe money has to be found. There is no Party in the State who can\r\ncensure us because of that. Our proposals for enlarging the public\r\nrevenue are just and fair to all classes. They will not, in spite of\r\nall these outcries you hear nowadays, sensibly alter the comfort or\r\nstatus, or even the elegance of any class in our great and varied\r\ncommunity. No man, rich or poor, will eat a worse dinner for our\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nOf course, from a narrow, electioneering point of view, there are a\r\ngreat many people--I believe they are wrong--who think we should have\r\ndone much better if we had put another penny on the income tax instead\r\nof increasing the tax upon tobacco. Well, I have come here this\r\nafternoon to tell you that we think it right that the working classes\r\nshould be asked to pay a share towards the conduct of a democratic\r\nState. And we think that taxes on luxuries, however widely consumed,\r\nare a proper channel for such payment to be made. We believe that the\r\nworking classes are able to pay by that channel, and we believe,\r\nfurther, that they are ready to pay. We do not think that in this old,\r\nwise country they would have respected any Government which at a time\r\nlike this had feared to go to them for their share.\r\n\r\nI have a good confidence that this Budget is going to go through. If\r\nthere are hardships and anomalies in particular cases or particular\r\nquarters, we are ready to consider them. They will emerge in the\r\ndiscussions of the House of Commons, and we have every desire to\r\nconsider them and to mitigate them. But we believe in the situation in\r\nwhich we find ourselves in this country, and in the general situation\r\nof the world at the present time--that the taxes on incomes over\r\nL3,000 a year, upon estates at death, on motor-cars before they cause\r\ndeath, upon tobacco, upon spirits, upon liquor licences, which really\r\nbelong to the State, and ought never to have been filched away; and,\r\nabove all, taxes upon the unearned increment in land are necessary,\r\nlegitimate, and fair; and that without any evil consequences to the\r\nrefinement or the richness of our national life, still less any injury\r\nto the sources of its economic productivity, they will yield revenue\r\nsufficient in this year and in the years to come to meet the growing\r\nneeds of Imperial defence and of social reform.\r\n\r\nThis Budget will go through. It will vindicate the power of the House\r\nof Commons. It will show, what some people were inclined to forget,\r\nthat in our Constitution a Government, supported by a House of Commons\r\nand the elected representatives of the people, has in fact a full\r\ncontrol of national affairs, and has the means of giving effect to its\r\nintentions, to its policy, and to its pledges in every sphere of\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nThat is one thing which the passage of this Budget will show. Let not\r\nthat be overlooked. But that is not the only thing; the Budget will do\r\nmore than that. It will reveal the financial strength of Britain. At a\r\ntime when every European country is borrowing merely for the needs of\r\nordinary annual expenditure, when all these disturbing naval\r\nprogrammes, which are injuring the peace of the world and the security\r\nand progress of civilisation, are being supported by borrowed money;\r\nand when the credit of Germany has fallen below that of Italy, this\r\ncountry, which has necessarily to make the biggest expenditure for\r\nnaval defence of any country, will be found, under a Free Trade system\r\nand by our proposals, able not only to pay its way, but to pay off the\r\ndebts of the past--to pay off the debts of our predecessors--even in\r\nthe worst of times at the rate of something like L7,000,000 a year.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to you of the causes which in the past have led up to\r\nthis Budget. I have spoken to you of its present justification. What\r\nof the future? If I had to sum up the immediate future of democratic\r\npolitics in a single word I should say \"Insurance.\" That is the\r\nfuture--Insurance against dangers from abroad. Insurance against\r\ndangers scarcely less grave and much more near and constant which\r\nthreaten us here at home in our own island. I had the honour and\r\nopportunity a few days ago of explaining to the House of Commons our\r\nproposals for unemployment insurance. That is a considerable matter.\r\nIt stands by itself. It is a much simpler question than invalidity\r\ninsurance; but it is a great matter by itself. Indeed, I thought while\r\nI was explaining it to the House of Commons that I had not made such\r\nan important speech since I had the honour of explaining the details\r\nof the Transvaal Constitution.\r\n\r\nWell, what is the proposal? The proposal is that you should make a\r\nbeginning. We have stood still too long. We should begin forthwith,\r\ntaking some of the greatest trades of the country in which\r\nunemployment is most serious, in which fluctuations are most severe,\r\nin which there are no short-time arrangements to mitigate the\r\nseverity to the individual; and that a system of compulsory\r\ncontributory insurance, with a large subvention from the State, should\r\nbe introduced into those great industries.\r\n\r\nBut our proposals go farther than that. The State assistance to\r\nunemployment insurance will not be limited to those trades in which it\r\nis compulsory. Side by side with the compulsory system we shall offer\r\nfacilities to voluntary insurance schemes in other trades, managed by\r\ntrade unions or by societies or groups of workmen. Moreover, we\r\ncontemplate that the State insurance office should undertake, if\r\ndesired, the insurance against unemployment of any individual workman\r\nin any trade outside of those for which compulsory powers are\r\nrequired, and should afford to these individuals an equivalent support\r\nto that which is given in the trades which are subject to the\r\ncompulsory system.\r\n\r\nOf course you will understand that the terms, that can be offered\r\nunder a voluntary or partial system, are not so good as those which\r\ncan be obtained in the compulsory system of a great trade. Where all\r\nstand together, it is much better for each. But still it is certain\r\nthat individuals who take advantage of the insurance policy which\r\nwill be introduced, and I trust carried through Parliament next year,\r\nwill be able to secure terms which will be much more favourable than\r\nany which are open to them by their unaided contributions at the\r\npresent time, because their contributions will be reinforced by the\r\ncontributions of the State. Further, if our beginning proves a success\r\nthe attempt and the system will not stop there. It will be extended,\r\nand in proportion as experience and experiment justify its extension,\r\nin proportion as the people of this country desire its extension, it\r\nmust eventually cover, in course of years, the whole of our great\r\nindustrial community.\r\n\r\nWell now, it is said that in adopting the policy of contributory\r\ninsurance the Government have admitted that they were wrong in\r\nestablishing old-age pensions upon the non-contributory basis. Now I\r\ndo not think that is true. There is no inconsistency or contradiction\r\nbetween a non-contributory system of old-age pensions and a\r\ncontributory system of insurance against unemployment, sickness,\r\ninvalidity, and widowhood. The circumstances and conditions are\r\nentirely different. The prospect of attaining extreme old age, of\r\nliving beyond threescore years and ten, which is the allotted span of\r\nhuman life, seems so doubtful and remote to the ordinary man, when in\r\nthe full strength of manhood, that it has been found in practice\r\nalmost impossible to secure from any very great number of people the\r\nregular sacrifices which are necessary to guard against old age.\r\n\r\nBut unemployment, accident, sickness, and the death of the\r\nbread-winner are catastrophes which may reach any household at any\r\nmoment. Those vultures are always hovering around us, and I do not\r\nbelieve there is any sensible, honest man who would not wish to guard\r\nhimself against them, if it were in his power to make the necessary\r\ncontribution, and if he were sure--this is a very important\r\npoint--that he would not by any accident or fraud or muddle be done\r\nout of the security he had paid for. And if we choose to adopt one\r\nsystem of State-aid for dealing with one class of need, and quite a\r\ndifferent system for dealing with quite a different class of need, it\r\ndoes not lie with any one, least of all does it lie with those who\r\nhave impartially neglected every problem and every solution, to\r\nreproach us with inconsistency.\r\n\r\nBut I go farther. The Old-Age Pensions Act, so far from being in\r\nconflict with a scheme of contributory insurance, is really its most\r\nhelpful and potent ally. The fact that at seventy the State pension is\r\nassured to all those who need it, makes a tremendous difference to\r\nevery form of insurance confined to the years before seventy, whether\r\nfor old age or for invalidity. I asked an eminent actuary the other\r\nday to make me some calculations. They are rough, general\r\ncalculations, and no doubt they might be more exact. But roughly, I\r\nbelieve it to be no exaggeration to say that the rates to cover a man\r\ntill seventy are in many cases scarcely half what they would be, if\r\nthey had to cover him till death. Do you see what that means? It is a\r\nprodigious fact. It is the sort of fact by the discovery of which\r\npeople make gigantic fortunes; and I suggest to you that we should\r\nmake this gigantic fortune for John Bull. It means that the whole\r\nfield of insurance has become much more fruitful than it ever was\r\nbefore, that there is a new class of insurance business possible which\r\nnever was possible before. It means that the whole field of insurance\r\nis far more open to the poorest class of people than it was before,\r\nand that with a proper system the benefits of the Old-Age Pensions\r\nAct would not be confined to the actual pensioners who are drawing\r\ntheir money, but would extend forwards in anticipation to all other\r\nclasses and to all other people, and that so far as five shillings a\r\nweek is concerned--that is not much unless you have not got it--the\r\nactuarial position of every man and woman in this country has been\r\nenormously improved by the Old-Age Pensions Act.\r\n\r\nIt is of that improvement that we mean to take advantage next year.\r\nNext year, when Free Trade will have yielded the necessary funds to\r\nthe revenue, we mean to move forward into this great new field. But\r\nlet me say one thing which is of the utmost importance. We must\r\nremember that the field of insurance is already largely covered by a\r\ngreat mass of benevolent and friendly societies, just as the field of\r\nunemployment insurance is already occupied to some extent by trade\r\nunions, and the Government would not approve of any development or\r\nextension of the policy of insurance which did not do full justice to\r\nexisting institutions, or which did not safeguard those institutions,\r\nto whom we owe so inestimable and incommensurable a debt, or caused\r\nany sudden disturbance or any curtailment of their general methods of\r\nbusiness. On the contrary, we believe that when our proposals are put\r\nin their full detail before the country, they will be found to benefit\r\nand encourage and not to injure those agencies which have so long been\r\nvoluntarily and prosperously at work.\r\n\r\nThe decisive question is this--will the British working classes\r\nembrace the opportunities which will shortly be offered to them? They\r\nare a new departure; they involve an element of compulsion and of\r\nregulation which is unusual in our happy-go-lucky English life. The\r\nopportunity may never return. For my own part, I confess to you, my\r\nfriends in Manchester, that I would work for such a policy and would\r\ntry to carry it through even if it were a little unpopular at first,\r\nand would be willing to pay the forfeit of a period of exclusion from\r\npower, in order to have carried such a policy through; because I know\r\nthat there is no other way within the reach of this generation of men\r\nand women by which the stream of preventable misery can be cut off.\r\n\r\nIf I had my way I would write the word \"Insure\" over the door of every\r\ncottage, and upon the blotting-book of every public man, because I am\r\nconvinced that by sacrifices which are inconceivably small, which are\r\nall within the power of the very poorest man in regular work, families\r\ncan be secured against catastrophes which otherwise would smash them\r\nup for ever. I think it is our duty to use the strength and the\r\nresources of the State to arrest the ghastly waste not merely of human\r\nhappiness but of national health and strength which follows when a\r\nworking man's home which has taken him years to get together is broken\r\nup and scattered through a long spell of unemployment, or when,\r\nthrough the death, the sickness, or the invalidity of the\r\nbread-winner, the frail boat in which the fortunes of the family are\r\nembarked founders, and the women and children are left to struggle\r\nhelplessly on the dark waters of a friendless world. I believe it is\r\nwell within our power now, before this Parliament is over, to\r\nestablish vast and broad throughout the land a mighty system of\r\nnational insurance which will nourish in its bosom all worthy existing\r\nagencies and will embrace in its scope all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nI think it is not untrue to say that in these years we are passing\r\nthrough a decisive period in the history of our country. The wonderful\r\ncentury which followed the Battle of Waterloo and the downfall of the\r\nNapoleonic domination, which secured to this small island so long and\r\nso resplendent a reign, has come to an end. We have arrived at a new\r\ntime. Let us realise it. And with that new time strange methods, huge\r\nforces, larger combinations--a Titanic world--have sprung up around\r\nus. The foundations of our power are changing. To stand still would be\r\nto fall; to fall would be to perish. We must go forward. We will go\r\nforward. We will go forward into a way of life more earnestly viewed,\r\nmore scientifically organised, more consciously national than any we\r\nhave known. Thus alone shall we be able to sustain and to renew\r\nthrough the generations which are to come, the fame and the power of\r\nthe British race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND AND INCOME TAXES IN THE BUDGET\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, _July 17, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Times_, by permission.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are often assured by sagacious persons that the civilisation of\r\nmodern States is largely based upon respect for the rights of private\r\nproperty. If that be true, it is also true that such respect cannot be\r\nsecured, and ought not, indeed, to be expected, unless property is\r\nassociated in the minds of the great mass of the people with ideas of\r\njustice and of reason.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, of the first importance to the country--to any\r\ncountry--that there should be vigilant and persistent efforts to\r\nprevent abuses, to distribute the public burdens fairly among all\r\nclasses, and to establish good laws governing the methods by which\r\nwealth may be acquired. The best way to make private property secure\r\nand respected is to bring the processes by which it is gained into\r\nharmony with the general interests of the public. When and where\r\nproperty is associated with the idea of reward for services rendered,\r\nwith the idea of recompense for high gifts and special aptitudes\r\ndisplayed or for faithful labour done, then property will be honoured.\r\nWhen it is associated with processes which are beneficial, or which at\r\nthe worst are not actually injurious to the commonwealth, then\r\nproperty will be unmolested; but when it is associated with ideas of\r\nwrong and of unfairness, with processes of restriction and monopoly,\r\nand other forms of injury to the community, then I think that you will\r\nfind that property will be assailed and will be endangered.\r\n\r\nA year ago I was fighting an election in Dundee. In the course of that\r\nelection I attempted to draw a fundamental distinction between the\r\nprinciples of Liberalism and of Socialism, and I said \"Socialism\r\nattacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly.\" And it is from that\r\nfundamental distinction that I come directly to the land proposals of\r\nthe present Budget.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that the land monopoly is not the only monopoly which\r\nexists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies; it is a perpetual\r\nmonopoly, and it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. It is\r\nquite true that unearned increments in land are not the only form of\r\nunearned or undeserved profit which individuals are able to secure;\r\nbut it is the principal form of unearned increment, derived from\r\nprocesses, which are not merely not beneficial, but which are\r\npositively detrimental to the general public. Land, which is a\r\nnecessity of human existence, which is the original source of all\r\nwealth, which is strictly limited in extent, which is fixed in\r\ngeographical position--land, I say, differs from all other forms of\r\nproperty in these primary and fundamental conditions.\r\n\r\nNothing is more amusing than to watch the efforts of our monopolist\r\nopponents to prove that other forms of property and increment are\r\nexactly the same and are similar in all respects to the unearned\r\nincrement in land. They talk to us of the increased profits of a\r\ndoctor or a lawyer from the growth of population in the towns in which\r\nthey live. They talk to us of the profits of a railway through a\r\ngreater degree of wealth and activity in the districts through which\r\nit runs. They tell us of the profits which are derived from a rise in\r\nstocks and shares, and even of those which are sometimes derived from\r\nthe sale of pictures and works of art, and they ask us--as if it were\r\ntheir only complaint--\"Ought not all these other forms to be taxed\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\nBut see how misleading and false all these analogies are. The\r\nwindfalls which people with artistic gifts are able from time to time\r\nto derive from the sale of a picture--from a Vandyke or a Holbein--may\r\nhere and there be very considerable. But pictures do not get in\r\nanybody's way. They do not lay a toll on anybody's labour; they do not\r\ntouch enterprise and production at any point; they do not affect any\r\nof those creative processes upon which the material well-being of\r\nmillions depends. And if a rise in stocks and shares confers profits\r\non the fortunate holders far beyond what they expected, or, indeed,\r\ndeserved, nevertheless, that profit has not been reaped by withholding\r\nfrom the community the land which it needs, but, on the contrary,\r\napart from mere gambling, it has been reaped by supplying industry\r\nwith the capital without which it could not be carried on.\r\n\r\nIf the railway makes greater profits, it is usually because it carries\r\nmore goods and more passengers. If a doctor or a lawyer enjoys a\r\nbetter practice, it is because the doctor attends more patients and\r\nmore exacting patients, and because the lawyer pleads more suits in\r\nthe courts and more important suits. At every stage the doctor or the\r\nlawyer is giving service in return for his fees; and if the service is\r\ntoo poor or the fees are too high, other doctors and other lawyers can\r\ncome freely into competition. There is constant service, there is\r\nconstant competition; there is no monopoly, there is no injury to the\r\npublic interest, there is no impediment to the general progress.\r\n\r\nFancy comparing these healthy processes with the enrichment which\r\ncomes to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the\r\noutskirts or at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the\r\nbusy population around him making the city larger, richer, more\r\nconvenient, more famous every day, and all the while sits still and\r\ndoes nothing! Roads are made, streets are made, railway services are\r\nimproved, electric light turns night into day, electric trams glide\r\nswiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles\r\noff in the mountains--and all the while the landlord sits still. Every\r\none of those improvements is effected by the labour and at the cost of\r\nother people. Many of the most important are effected at the cost of\r\nthe municipality and of the ratepayers. To not one of those\r\nimprovements does the land monopolist, as a land monopolist,\r\ncontribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land is\r\nsensibly enhanced.\r\n\r\nHe renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the\r\ngeneral welfare, he contributes nothing even to the process from which\r\nhis own enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or\r\nby dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon\r\nthem in aid of the general fund; but the land may be unoccupied,\r\nundeveloped, it may be what is called \"ripening\"--ripening at the\r\nexpense of the whole city, of the whole country--for the unearned\r\nincrement of its owner. Roads perhaps have to be diverted to avoid\r\nthis forbidden area. The merchant going to his office, the artisan\r\ngoing to his work, have to make a detour or pay a tram fare to avoid\r\nit. The citizens are losing their chance of developing the land, the\r\ncity is losing its rates, the State is losing its taxes which would\r\nhave accrued, if the natural development had taken place--and that\r\nshare has to be replaced at the expense of the other ratepayers and\r\ntaxpayers; and the nation as a whole is losing in the competition of\r\nthe world--the hard and growing competition in the world--both in time\r\nand money. And all the while the land monopolist has only to sit still\r\nand watch complacently his property multiplying in value, sometimes\r\nmanifold, without either effort or contribution on his part. And that\r\nis justice!\r\n\r\nBut let us follow the process a little farther. The population of the\r\ncity grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the\r\npoorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and\r\nthousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are\r\n120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the\r\npresent time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale--that means that\r\nthe price is too tempting to be resisted any longer--and then, and not\r\ntill then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or\r\ntwenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which\r\nalone hitherto it has been rated for the public service.\r\n\r\nThe greater the population around the land, the greater the injury\r\nwhich they have sustained by its protracted denial, the more\r\ninconvenience which has been caused to everybody, the more serious the\r\nloss in economic strength and activity, the larger will be the profit\r\nof the landlord when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact you may\r\nsay that the unearned increment on the land is on all-fours with the\r\nprofit gathered by one of those American speculators who engineer a\r\ncorner in corn, or meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and\r\nthat the unearned increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist\r\nin exact proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice done.\r\n\r\nIt is monopoly which is the keynote; and where monopoly prevails, the\r\ngreater the injury to society, the greater the reward of the\r\nmonopolist will be. See how this evil process strikes at every form of\r\nindustrial activity. The municipality, wishing for broader streets,\r\nbetter houses, more healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is\r\nmade to pay, and is made to pay in exact proportion, or to a very\r\ngreat extent in proportion, as it has exerted itself in the past to\r\nmake improvements. The more it has improved the town, the more it has\r\nincreased the land value, and the more it will have to pay for any\r\nland it may wish to acquire. The manufacturer purposing to start a\r\nnew industry, proposing to erect a great factory offering employment\r\nto thousands of hands, is made to pay such a price for his land that\r\nthe purchase-price hangs round the neck of his whole business,\r\nhampering his competitive power in every market, clogging him far more\r\nthan any foreign tariff in his export competition; and the land values\r\nstrike down through the profits of the manufacturer on to the wages of\r\nthe workman. The railway company wishing to build a new line finds\r\nthat the price of land which yesterday was only rated at its\r\nagricultural value has risen to a prohibitive figure the moment it was\r\nknown that the new line was projected; and either the railway is not\r\nbuilt, or, if it is, is built, only on terms which largely transfer to\r\nthe landowner the profits which are due to the shareholders and the\r\nadvantages which should have accrued to the travelling public.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter where you look or what examples you select, you\r\nwill see that every form of enterprise, every step in material\r\nprogress, is only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the\r\ncream off for himself, and everywhere to-day the man, or the public\r\nbody, who wishes to put land to its highest use is forced to pay a\r\npreliminary fine in land values to the man who is putting it to an\r\ninferior use, and in some cases to no use at all. All comes back to\r\nthe land value, and its owner for the time being is able to levy his\r\ntoll upon all other forms of wealth and upon every form of industry. A\r\nportion, in some cases the whole, of every benefit which is\r\nlaboriously acquired by the community is represented in the land\r\nvalue, and finds its way automatically into the landlord's pocket. If\r\nthere is a rise in wages, rents are able to move forward, because the\r\nworkers can afford to pay a little more. If the opening of a new\r\nrailway or a new tramway, or the institution of an improved service of\r\nworkmen's trains, or a lowering of fares, or a new invention, or any\r\nother public convenience affords a benefit to the workers in any\r\nparticular district, it becomes easier for them to live, and therefore\r\nthe landlord and the ground landlord, one on top of the other, are\r\nable to charge them more for the privilege of living there.\r\n\r\nSome years ago in London there was a toll-bar on a bridge across the\r\nThames, and all the working people who lived on the south side of the\r\nriver, had to pay a daily toll of one penny for going and returning\r\nfrom their work. The spectacle of these poor people thus mulcted of so\r\nlarge a proportion of their earnings appealed to the public\r\nconscience: an agitation was set on foot, municipal authorities were\r\nroused, and at the cost of the ratepayers the bridge was freed and the\r\ntoll removed. All those people who used the bridge were saved 6d. a\r\nweek. Within a very short period from that time the rents on the south\r\nside of the river were found to have advanced by about 6d. a week, or\r\nthe amount of the toll which had been remitted. And a friend of mine\r\nwas telling me the other day that in the parish of Southwark about\r\nL350 a year, roughly speaking, was given away in doles of bread by\r\ncharitable people in connection with one of the churches, and as a\r\nconsequence of this the competition for small houses, but more\r\nparticularly for single-roomed tenements is, we are told, so great\r\nthat rents are considerably higher than in the neighbouring district.\r\n\r\nAll goes back to the land, and the landowner, who in many cases, in\r\nmost cases, is a worthy person utterly unconscious of the character of\r\nthe methods by which he is enriched, is enabled with resistless\r\nstrength to absorb to himself a share of almost every public and\r\nevery private benefit, however important or however pitiful those\r\nbenefits may be.\r\n\r\nI hope you will understand that when I speak of the land monopolist, I\r\nam dealing more with the process than with the individual landowner. I\r\nhave no wish to hold any class up to public disapprobation. I do not\r\nthink that the man who makes money by unearned increment in land, is\r\nmorally a worse man than any one else, who gathers his profit where he\r\nfinds it, in this hard world under the law and according to common\r\nusage. It is not the individual I attack; it is the system. It is not\r\nthe man who is bad; it is the law which is bad. It is not the man who\r\nis blameworthy for doing what the law allows and what other men do; it\r\nis the State which would be blameworthy, were it not to endeavour to\r\nreform the law and correct the practice. We do not want to punish the\r\nlandlord. We want to alter the law. Look at our actual proposal.\r\n\r\nWe do not go back on the past. We accept as our basis the value as it\r\nstands to-day. The tax on the increment of land begins by recognising\r\nand franking all past increment. We look only to the future; and for\r\nthe future we say only this: that the community shall be the partner\r\nin any further increment above the present value after all the owner's\r\nimprovements have been deducted. We say that the State and the\r\nmunicipality should jointly levy a toll upon the future unearned\r\nincrement of the land. A toll of what? Of the whole? No. Of a half?\r\nNo. Of a quarter? No. Of a fifth--that is the proposal of the Budget.\r\nAnd that is robbery, that is plunder, that is communism and\r\nspoliation, that is the social revolution at last, that is the\r\noverturn of civilised society, that is the end of the world foretold\r\nin the Apocalypse! Such is the increment tax about which so much\r\nchatter and outcry are raised at the present time, and upon which I\r\nwill say that no more fair, considerate, or salutary proposal for\r\ntaxation has ever been made in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nBut there is another proposal concerning land values which is not less\r\nimportant. I mean the tax on the capital value of undeveloped urban or\r\nsuburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value\r\nunder the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put. In\r\nconsequence, income and rateable value are not always true or\r\ncomplete measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I\r\nhave already referred, of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a\r\ngrowing town idle for years, while it is \"ripening\"--that is to say,\r\nwhile it is rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding\r\ncommunity and the need of that community for more room to live. Take\r\nthat case. I daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr.\r\nBalfour, Lord Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think\r\nthat that is an admirable arrangement. They speak of the profits of\r\nthe land monopolist, as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry\r\nand a pleasing example for the poorer classes to imitate. We do not\r\ntake that view of the process. We think it is a dog-in-the-manger\r\ngame. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we\r\nsee the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in\r\ndistorted or restricted development, and in congested centres of\r\npopulation, and we say here and now to the land monopolist who is\r\nholding up his land--and the pity is, it was not said before--you\r\nshall judge for yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not--we say\r\nto the land monopolist: \"This property of yours might be put to\r\nimmediate use with general advantage. It is at this minute saleable in\r\nthe market at ten times the value at which it is rated. If you choose\r\nto keep it idle in the expectation of still further unearned\r\nincrement, then at least you shall be taxed at the true selling value\r\nin the meanwhile.\" And the Budget proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the\r\npound on the capital value of all such land; that is to say, a tax\r\nwhich is a little less in equivalent, than the income-tax would be\r\nupon the property, if the property were fully developed.\r\n\r\nThat is the second main proposal of the Budget with regard to the\r\nland; and its effects will be, first, to raise an expanding revenue\r\nfor the needs of the State; secondly that, half the proceeds of this\r\ntax, as well as of the other land taxes, will go to the municipalities\r\nand local authorities generally to relieve rates; thirdly, the effect\r\nwill be, as we believe, to bring land into the market, and thus\r\nsomewhat cheapen the price at which land is obtainable for every\r\nobject, public and private. By so doing we shall liberate new springs\r\nof enterprise and industry, we shall stimulate building, relieve\r\novercrowding, and promote employment.\r\n\r\nThese two taxes, both in themselves financially, economically, and\r\nsocially sound, carry with them a further notable advantage. We shall\r\nobtain a complete valuation of the whole of the land in the United\r\nKingdom. We shall procure an up-to-date Doomsday-book showing the\r\ncapital value, apart from buildings and improvements, of every piece\r\nof land. Now, there is nothing new in the principle of valuation for\r\ntaxation purposes. It was established fifteen years ago in Lord\r\nRosebery's Government by the Finance Act of 1894, and it has been\r\napplied ever since without friction or inconvenience by Conservative\r\nadministrations.\r\n\r\nAnd if there is nothing new in the principle of valuation, still less\r\nis there anything new or unexpected in the general principles\r\nunderlying the land proposals of the Budget. Why, Lord Rosebery\r\ndeclared himself in favour of taxation of land values fifteen years\r\nago. Lord Balfour has said a great many shrewd and sensible things on\r\nthis subject which he is, no doubt, very anxious to have overlooked at\r\nthe present time. The House of Commons has repeatedly affirmed the\r\nprinciple, not only under Liberal Governments, but--which is much more\r\nremarkable--under a Conservative Government. Four times during the\r\nlast Parliament Mr. Trevelyan's Bill for the taxation of land values\r\nwas brought before the House of Commons and fully discussed, and twice\r\nit was read a second time during the last Parliament, with its great\r\nConservative majority, the second time by a majority of no less than\r\nninety votes. The House of Lords, in adopting Lord Camperdown's\r\namendment to the Scottish Valuation Bill, has absolutely conceded the\r\nprinciple of rating undeveloped land upon its selling value, although\r\nit took very good care not to apply the principle; and all the\r\ngreatest municipal corporations in England and Scotland--many of them\r\noverwhelmingly Conservative in complexion--have declared themselves in\r\nfavour of the taxation of land values; and now, after at least a\r\ngeneration of study, examination, and debate, the time has come when\r\nwe should take the first step to put these principles into practical\r\neffect. You have heard the saying \"The hour and the man.\" The hour has\r\ncome, and with it the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nI have come to Scotland to exhort you to engage in this battle and\r\ndevote your whole energy and influence to securing a memorable\r\nvictory. Every nation in the world has its own way of doing things,\r\nits own successes and its own failures. All over Europe we see systems\r\nof land tenure which economically, socially, and politically are far\r\nsuperior to ours; but the benefits that those countries derive from\r\ntheir improved land systems are largely swept away, or at any rate\r\nneutralised, by grinding tariffs on the necessaries of life and the\r\nmaterials of manufacture. In this country we have long enjoyed the\r\nblessings of Free Trade and of untaxed bread and meat, but against\r\nthese inestimable benefits we have the evils of an unreformed and\r\nvicious land system. In no great country in the new world or the old\r\nhave the working people yet secured the double advantage of free trade\r\nand free land together, by which I mean a commercial system and a land\r\nsystem from which, so far as possible, all forms of monopoly have been\r\nrigorously excluded. Sixty years ago our system of national taxation\r\nwas effectively reformed, and immense and undisputed advantages\r\naccrued therefrom to all classes, the richest as well as the poorest.\r\nThe system of local taxation to-day is just as vicious and wasteful,\r\njust as great an impediment to enterprise and progress, just as harsh\r\na burden upon the poor, as the thousand taxes and Corn Law sliding\r\nscales of the \"hungry 'forties.\" We are met in an hour of tremendous\r\nopportunity. \"You who shall liberate the land,\" said Mr. Cobden, \"will\r\ndo more for your country than we have done in the liberation of its\r\ncommerce.\"\r\n\r\nYou can follow the same general principle of distinguishing between\r\nearned and unearned increment through the Government's treatment of\r\nthe income-tax. There is all the difference in the world between the\r\nincome which a man makes from month to month or from year to year by\r\nhis continued exertion, which may stop at any moment, and will\r\ncertainly stop, if he is incapacitated, and the income which is\r\nderived from the profits of accumulated capital, which is a continuing\r\nincome irrespective of the exertion of its owner. Nobody wants to\r\npenalise or to stigmatise income derived from dividends, rent, or\r\ninterest; for accumulated capital, apart from monopoly, represents the\r\nexercise of thrift and prudence, qualities which are only less\r\nvaluable to the community than actual service and labour. But the\r\ngreat difference between the two classes of income remains. We are all\r\nsensible of it, and we think that that great difference should be\r\nrecognised when the necessary burdens of the State have to be divided\r\nand shared between all classes.\r\n\r\nThe application of this principle of differentiation of income-tax has\r\nenabled the present Government sensibly to lighten the burden of the\r\ngreat majority of income-tax payers. Under the late Conservative\r\nGovernment about 1,100,000 income-tax payers paid income-tax at the\r\nstatutory rate of a shilling in the pound. Mr. Asquith, the Prime\r\nMinister, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, reduced the income-tax in\r\nrespect of earned incomes under L2,000 a year from a shilling to\r\nninepence, and it is calculated that 750,000 income-tax payers--that\r\nis to say, nearly three-quarters of the whole number of income-tax\r\npayers--who formerly paid at the shilling rate have obtained an actual\r\nrelief from taxation to the extent of nearly L1,200,000 a year in the\r\naggregate. The present Chancellor of the Exchequer in the present\r\nBudget has added to this abatement a further relief--a very sensible\r\nrelief, I venture to think you will consider it--on account of each\r\nchild of parents who possess under L500 a year, and that concession\r\ninvolved a further abatement and relief equal to L600,000 a year.\r\nThat statement is founded on high authority, for it figured in one of\r\nthe Budget proposals of Mr. Pitt, and it is to-day recognised by the\r\nlaw of Prussia.\r\n\r\nTaking together the income-tax reforms of Mr. Asquith and Mr.\r\nLloyd-George, taking the two together--because they are all part of\r\nthe same policy, and they are all part of our treatment as a\r\nGovernment of this great subject--it is true to say that very nearly\r\nthree out of every four persons who pay income-tax will be taxed after\r\nthis Budget, this penal Budget, this wicked, monstrous, despoliatory\r\nBudget--three out of every four persons will be taxed for income-tax\r\nat a lower rate than they were by the late Conservative Government.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps say to me that may be all very well, but are you sure\r\nthat the rich and the very rich are not being burdened too heavily?\r\nAre you sure that you are not laying on the backs of people who are\r\nstruggling to support existence with incomes of upwards of L3,000 a\r\nyear, burdens which are too heavy to be borne? Will they not sink,\r\ncrushed by the load of material cares, into early graves, followed\r\nthere even by the unrelenting hand of the death duties collector? Will\r\nthey not take refuge in wholesale fraud and evasion, as some of their\r\nleaders ingenuously suggest, or will there be a general flight of all\r\nrich people from their native shores to the protection of the\r\nhospitable foreigner? Let me reassure you on these points.\r\n\r\nThe taxes which we now seek to impose to meet the need of the State\r\nwill not appreciably affect, have not appreciably affected, the\r\ncomfort, the status, or even the style of living of any class in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. There has been no invidious singling out of a few rich\r\nmen for special taxation. The increased burden which is placed upon\r\nwealth is evenly and broadly distributed over the whole of that\r\nwealthy class who are more numerous in Great Britain than in any other\r\ncountry in the world, and who, when this Budget is passed, will still\r\nfind Great Britain the best country to live in. When I reflect upon\r\nthe power and influence that class possesses, upon the general\r\ngoodwill with which they are still regarded by their poorer\r\nneighbours, upon the infinite opportunities for pleasure and for\r\nculture which are open to them in this free, prosperous, and orderly\r\ncommonwealth, I cannot doubt that they ought to contribute, and I\r\nbelieve that great numbers of them are willing to contribute, in a\r\ngreater degree than heretofore, towards the needs of the navy, for\r\nwhich they are always clamouring, and for those social reforms upon\r\nwhich the health and contentment of the whole population depend.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, gentlemen, when we are upon the sorrows of the rich and\r\nthe heavy blows that have been struck by this wicked Budget, let us\r\nnot forget that this Budget, which is denounced by all the vested\r\ninterests in the country and in all the abodes of wealth and power,\r\nafter all, draws nearly as much from the taxation of tobacco and\r\nspirits, which are the luxuries of the working classes, who pay their\r\nshare with silence and dignity, as it does from those wealthy classes\r\nupon whose behalf such heartrending outcry is made.\r\n\r\nI do not think the issue before the country was ever more simple than\r\nit is now. The money must be found; there is no dispute about that.\r\nBoth parties are responsible for the expenditure and the obligations\r\nwhich render new revenue necessary; and, as we know, we have\r\ndifficulty in resisting demands which are made upon us by the\r\nConservative Party for expenditure upon armaments far beyond the\r\nlimits which are necessary to maintain adequately the defences of the\r\ncountry, and which would only be the accompaniment of a sensational\r\nand aggressive policy in foreign and in Colonial affairs. We declare\r\nthat the proposals we have put forward are conceived with a desire to\r\nbe fair to all and harsh to none. We assert they are conceived with a\r\ndesire to secure good laws regulating the conditions by which wealth\r\nmay be obtained and a just distribution of the burdens of the State.\r\nWe know that the proposals which we have made will yield all the money\r\nthat we need for national defence, and that they will yield an\r\nexpanding revenue in future years for those great schemes of social\r\norganisation, of national insurance, of agricultural development, and\r\nof the treatment of the problems of poverty and unemployment, which\r\nare absolutely necessary if Great Britain is to hold her own in the\r\nfront rank of the nations. The issue which you have to decide is\r\nwhether these funds shall be raised by the taxation of a protective\r\ntariff upon articles of common use and upon the necessaries of life,\r\nincluding bread and meat, or whether it shall be raised, as we\r\npropose, by the taxation of luxuries, of superfluities, and\r\nmonopolies.\r\n\r\nI have only one word more to say, and it is rendered necessary by the\r\nobservations which fell from Lord Lansdowne last night, when,\r\naccording to the Scottish papers, he informed a gathering at which he\r\nwas the principal speaker that the House of Lords was not obliged to\r\nswallow the Budget whole or without mincing.[18] I ask you to mark\r\nthat word. It is a characteristic expression. The House of Lords means\r\nto assert its right to mince. Now let us for our part be quite frank\r\nand plain. We want this Budget Bill to be fairly and fully discussed;\r\nwe do not grudge the weeks that have been spent already; we are\r\nprepared to make every sacrifice--I speak for my honourable friends\r\nwho are sitting on this platform--of personal convenience in order to\r\nsecure a thorough, patient, searching examination of proposals the\r\nimportance of which we do not seek to conceal. The Government has\r\nshown itself ready and willing to meet reasonable argument, not merely\r\nby reasonable answer, but when a case is shown, by concessions, and\r\ngenerally in a spirit of goodwill. We have dealt with this subject\r\nthroughout with a desire to mitigate hardships in special cases, and\r\nto gain as large a measure of agreement as possible for the proposals\r\nwe are placing before the country. We want the Budget not merely to be\r\nthe work of the Cabinet and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; we\r\nwant it to be the shaped and moulded plan deliberately considered by\r\nthe House of Commons. That will be a long and painful process to those\r\nwho are forced from day to day to take part in it. We shall not shrink\r\nfrom it. But when that process is over, when the Finance Bill leaves\r\nthe House of Commons, I think you will agree with me that it ought to\r\nleave the House of Commons in its final form. No amendments, no\r\nexcision, no modifying or mutilating will be agreed to by us. We will\r\nstand no mincing, and unless Lord Lansdowne and his landlordly friends\r\nchoose to eat their own mince, Parliament will be dissolved, and we\r\nshall come to you in a moment of high consequence for every cause for\r\nwhich Liberalism has ever fought. See that you do not fail us in that\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Lord Lansdowne has since been at pains to explain that he did not\r\nuse the word \"mincing.\" That word ought to have been \"wincing\" or\r\n\"hesitation\"--it is not clear which.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET AND THE LORDS\r\n\r\nNORWICH, _July 26, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Manchester Guardian_, by permission.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Budget is the great political issue of the day. It involves all\r\nother questions; it has brought all other issues to a decisive test.\r\n_The Daily Mail_ has stated that the Budget is hung up. So it is. It\r\nis hung up in triumph over the High Peak; it is hung up as a banner of\r\nvictory over Dumfries, over Cleveland, and over Mid-Derby. The\r\nminiature general election just concluded has shown that the policy\r\nembodied in the Budget, and which inspires the Budget, has vivified\r\nand invigorated the Liberal Party, has brought union where there was\r\nfalling away, has revived enthusiasm where apathy was creeping in.\r\n\r\nYou cannot but have been impressed with the increasing sense of\r\nreality which political affairs have acquired during the last few\r\nmonths. What is it they are doing at Westminster? Across and beyond\r\nthe complicated details of finance, the thousand amendments and more\r\nwhich cover the order paper, the absurd obstruction, the dry\r\ndiscussions in Committee, the interminable repetition of divisions,\r\nthe angry scenes which flash up from time to time, the white-faced\r\nmembers sitting the whole night through and walking home worn out in\r\nthe full light of morning--across and beyond all this, can you not\r\ndiscern a people's cause in conflict? Can you not see a great effort\r\nto make a big step forward towards that brighter and more equal world\r\nfor which, be sure, those who come after us will hold our names in\r\nhonour? That is the issue which is being decided from week to week in\r\nWestminster now, and it is in support of that cause that we are asking\r\nfrom you earnest and unswerving allegiance.\r\n\r\nI do not think that there is any great country in the world where\r\nthere are so many strong forces of virtue and vitality as there are in\r\nour own country. But there is scarcely any country in the world where\r\nthere is so little organisation. Look at our neighbour and friendly\r\nrival Germany. I see that great State organised for peace and\r\norganised for war to a degree to which we cannot pretend. We are not\r\norganised as a nation, so far as I can see, for anything except party\r\npolitics, and even for purposes of party politics we are not organised\r\nso well as they are in the United States. A more scientific, a more\r\nelaborate, a more comprehensive social organisation is indispensable\r\nto our country if we are to surmount the trials and stresses which the\r\nfuture years will bring. It is this organisation that the policy of\r\nthe Budget will create. It is this organisation that the loss of the\r\nBudget will destroy.\r\n\r\nBut, we are told, \"it presses too heavily upon the land-owning\r\nclasses.\" I have heard it said that in the French Revolution, if the\r\nFrench nobility, instead of going to the scaffold with such dignity\r\nand fortitude, had struggled and cried and begged for mercy, even the\r\nhard hearts of the Paris crowd would have been melted, and the Reign\r\nof Terror would have come to an end. There is happily no chance of our\r\naristocracy having to meet such a fate in this loyal-hearted,\r\nlaw-abiding, sober-minded country. They are, however, asked to\r\ndischarge a certain obligation. They are asked to contribute their\r\nshare to the expenses of the State. That is all they are asked to do.\r\nYet what an outcry, what tribulation, what tears, what wrath, what\r\nweeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, and all because they are\r\nasked to pay their share.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose, to listen to them, that the whole of the taxation\r\nwas being raised from, or was about to be raised from the owners of\r\nagricultural estates. What are the facts? Nearly half the taxation of\r\nthe present Budget is raised by the taxation of the luxuries of the\r\nworking classes. Are they indignant? Are they crying out? Not in the\r\nleast. They are perfectly ready to pay their share, and to pay it in a\r\nmanly way, and two hundred thousand of them took the trouble to go to\r\nHyde Park the other day in order to say so.\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts about agricultural land? It is absolutely exempt\r\nfrom the operations of the new land taxation so long as agricultural\r\nland is worth no more for other purposes than it is for agricultural\r\npurposes: that is to say, so long as agricultural land is agricultural\r\nland and not urban or suburban land, it pays none of the new land\r\ntaxation. It is only when its value for building purposes makes its\r\ncontinued agricultural use wasteful and uneconomic, it is only when it\r\nbecomes building land and not agricultural land, and when because of\r\nthat change it rises enormously in price and value--it is only then\r\nthat it contributes under the new land taxation its share to the\r\npublic of the increment value which the public has given to it.\r\n\r\nThen take the death duties. One would suppose from what one hears in\r\nLondon and from the outcry that is raised, that the whole of the death\r\nduties were collected from the peers and from the county families.\r\nAgain I say, look at the facts. The Inland Revenue report for last\r\nyear shows that L313,000,000 of property passing on death became\r\nsubject to death duties, and of that sum L228,000,000 was personalty\r\nand not real estate, leaving only L85,000,000 real estate, and of that\r\nL85,000,000 only L22,000,000 was agricultural land. These death duties\r\nare represented as being levied entirely upon a small class of landed\r\ngentry and nobility, but, as a matter of fact, there is collected from\r\nthat class in respect of agricultural land only seven per cent. of the\r\nwhole amount of money which the Exchequer derives from death\r\nduties.[19]\r\n\r\nI decline, however, to judge the question of the House of Lords simply\r\nand solely by any action they may resolve to take upon the Budget. We\r\nmust look back upon the past. We remember the ill-usage and the\r\nhumiliation which the great majority that was returned by the nation\r\nto support Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1906 has sustained in the\r\nlast three years at the hands of the House of Lords. That Assembly\r\nmust be judged by their conduct as a whole. Lord Lansdowne has\r\nexplained, to the amusement of the nation, that he claimed no right on\r\nbehalf of the House of Lords to \"mince\" the Budget. All, he tells us,\r\nhe has asked for, so far as he is concerned, is the right to \"wince\"\r\nwhen swallowing it. Well, that is a much more modest claim. It is for\r\nthe Conservative Party to judge whether it is a very heroic claim for\r\none of their leaders to make. If they are satisfied with the wincing\r\nMarquis, we have no reason to protest. We should greatly regret to\r\ncause Lord Lansdowne and his friends any pain. We have no wish\r\nwhatever to grudge them any relief which they may obtain by wincing or\r\neven by squirming. We accord them the fullest liberty in that\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the House of Lords has made others wince in its time. Even\r\nin the present Parliament they have performed some notable exploits.\r\nWhen the House of Lords rejected the Bill to prevent one man casting\r\nhis vote two or three times over in the same election, every one in\r\nthis country who desired to see a full and true representation of the\r\npeople in Parliament might well have winced. When the House of Lords\r\nrejected or mutilated beyond repair the Land Valuation Bills for\r\nEngland and for Scotland, every land reformer in the country might\r\nhave winced. When the House of Lords destroyed Mr. Birrell's Education\r\nBill of 1906, every man who cared for religious equality and\r\neducational peace might have winced. When they contemptuously flung\r\nout, without even discussing it or examining it, the Licensing Bill,\r\nupon which so many hopes were centred and upon which so many months of\r\nlabour had been spent, they sent a message of despair to every\r\ntemperance reformer, to every social and philanthropic worker, to\r\nevery church, to every chapel, to every little Sunday school\r\nthroughout the land. If it should now prove to be their turn, if the\r\nmeasure they have meted out to others should be meted out to them\r\nagain, however much we might regret their sorrows, we could not but\r\nobserve the workings of poetic justice.\r\n\r\nBut I hope the House of Lords and those who back them will not be\r\nunder any illusions about the Budget and the position of the\r\nGovernment. The Government is in earnest about the Budget. The Budget\r\ncarries with it their fortunes and the fortunes of the Liberal Party.\r\nCareful argument, reasonable amendment, amicable concession, not\r\naffecting the principles at stake--all these we offer while the Bill\r\nis in the House of Commons. But when all that is said and done, as the\r\nBill leaves the House of Commons so it must stand. It would be a great\r\npity if Lord Curzon, the Indian pro-Consul, or the London\r\n_Spectator_--it would be a great pity if those potentates were to make\r\nthe great mistake of supposing that the Government would acquiesce in\r\nthe excision of the land clauses of the Budget by the House of Lords.\r\nSuch a course is unthinkable. Any Liberal Government which adopted it\r\nwould be swiftly ruined. The land proposals of the Government have not\r\nbeen made without long deliberation and full responsibility. We shall\r\nnot fail to carry them effectively through the House of Commons; still\r\nless shall we accept any amendment at the hands of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nIs it not an extraordinary thing that upon the Budget we should even\r\nbe discussing at all the action of the House of Lords? The House of\r\nLords is an institution absolutely foreign to the spirit of the age\r\nand to the whole movement of society. It is not perhaps surprising in\r\na country so fond of tradition, so proud of continuity, as ourselves\r\nthat a feudal assembly of titled persons, with so long a history and\r\nso many famous names, should have survived to exert an influence upon\r\npublic affairs at the present time. We see how often in England the\r\nold forms are reverently preserved after the forces by which they are\r\nsustained and the uses to which they were put and the dangers against\r\nwhich they were designed have passed away. A state of gradual decline\r\nwas what the average Englishman had come to associate with the House\r\nof Lords. Little by little, we might have expected, it would have\r\nceased to take a controversial part in practical politics. Year by\r\nyear it would have faded more completely into the past to which it\r\nbelongs until, like Jack-in-the-Green or Punch-and-Judy, only a\r\npicturesque and fitfully lingering memory would have remained.\r\n\r\nAnd during the last ten years of Conservative government this was\r\nactually the case. But now we see the House of Lords flushed with the\r\nwealth of the modern age, armed with a party caucus, fortified,\r\nrevived, resuscitated, asserting its claims in the harshest and in the\r\ncrudest manner, claiming to veto or destroy even without discussion\r\nany legislation, however important, sent to them by any majority,\r\nhowever large, from any House of Commons, however newly elected. We\r\nsee these unconscionable claims exercised with a frank and undisguised\r\nregard to party interest, to class interest, and to personal interest.\r\nWe see the House of Lords using the power which they should not hold\r\nat all, which if they hold at all, they should hold in trust for all,\r\nto play a shrewd, fierce, aggressive party game of electioneering and\r\ncasting their votes according to the interest of the particular\r\npolitical party to which, body and soul, they belong.\r\n\r\nIt is now suggested--publicly in some quarters, privately in many\r\nquarters--that the House of Lords will not only use without scruple\r\ntheir veto in legislation but they propose to extend their\r\nprerogatives; they are going to lay their hands upon finance, and if\r\nthey choose they will reject or amend the Budget. I have always\r\nthought it a great pity that Mr. Gladstone made a compromise with the\r\nHouse of Lords over the Franchise Bill of 1884. I regret, and I think\r\nmany of my hon. friends in the House of Commons will regret, looking\r\nback upon the past, that the present Government did not advise a\r\ndissolution of Parliament upon the rejection of the Education Bill in\r\n1906. A dissolution in those circumstances would not merely have\r\ninvolved the measure under discussion, but if the Government of that\r\nday had received the support of the electors at the poll their victory\r\nmust have carried with it that settlement and reform of the relations\r\nbetween the two Houses of Parliament which is necessary to secure the\r\neffective authority of the House of Commons. That is the question\r\nwhich, behind and beyond all others, even the Budget, even Free Trade,\r\neven the land--that is the question which, as the Prime Minister has\r\nsaid, is the dominant issue of our time.\r\n\r\nOpportunity is fickle, opportunity seldom returns; but I think you\r\nwill agree with me that if the House of Lords, not content with its\r\nrecent exploits with the legislative veto, were to seize on the new\r\npower which its backers claim for it over finance--if, not content\r\nwith the extreme assertions of its own privileges, it were to invade\r\nthe most ancient privileges of the House of Commons--if, as an act of\r\nclass warfare, for it would be nothing less, the House of Lords were\r\nto destroy the Budget, and thus not only create a Constitutional\r\ndeadlock of novel and unmeasured gravity, but also plunge the whole\r\nfinance of the country into unparalleled confusion, then, in my\r\njudgment, opportunity, clear, brilliant, and decisive, would return,\r\nand we should have the best chance we have ever had of dealing with\r\nthem once for all.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances may never occur. I don't believe they will occur.\r\nIf we only all stand firm together I believe the Budget will be\r\ncarried. I believe the Budget will vindicate the strength of the\r\nGovernment supported by the House of Commons. I believe it will\r\nvindicate the financial strength of this great country. I don't\r\nbelieve, if we pursue our course without wavering or weakening, there\r\nis any force in this country which can stand against us. The\r\nConservative Whip in the House of Lords, a friend of mine, Lord\r\nChurchill, said the other day that the House of Lords when they\r\nreceived the Budget would do their duty. I hope they will. But in any\r\ncase be sure of this--that the Government and the House of Commons\r\nwill do their duty. Then if there is anything more to be done, see\r\nthat you are ready to do your duty too.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Since the date of this speech the new concessions, doubling the\r\nallowance exempted from income tax for the expenses of agricultural\r\nestates, have been made public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE BUDGET\r\n\r\nLEICESTER, _September 5, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Times_, by permission.)\r\n\r\nI have done my best to study the political history of the last forty\r\nor fifty years, and I cannot find any Government which, at the end of\r\nits fourth year, enjoyed the same measure of support, prestige, and\r\ngood fortune that we do. The only Administration which could compare\r\nin the importance and the volume of its legislation with the present\r\nGovernment is Mr. Gladstone's great Government of 1868. That was a\r\nGovernment of measures and of men; but no measure of that Government\r\ncould equal in importance the Old-Age Pensions Act which we have\r\nplaced on the Statute-book. The settlement of the Irish Church\r\nquestion by Disestablishment was not a more baffling and intricate\r\nbusiness, than the settlement of the Irish University question which\r\nMr. Birrell has achieved. The labour legislation of the Government of\r\n1868, although very important, shows nothing which equals in\r\nimportance the Trades Disputes Act, which we have carried through, and\r\nMr. Cardwell's reforms in army organisation were not more successful,\r\nand were certainly much less generally accepted, than those which have\r\nbeen effected by Mr. Haldane. In the fourth year of its administration\r\nthe Government of 1868 was genuinely unpopular. It had quarrelled with\r\nthe Nonconformists without gaining the support of the Church; it had\r\noffended the liquor interest without satisfying the Temperance forces\r\nin the country; it had disturbed and offended many vested interests\r\nwithout arousing popular enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if you look back, you will find that the fourth year in the\r\nhistory of a Government is always a very critical and has often been a\r\nvery unfortunate year. It is quite true that Mr. Disraeli's\r\nGovernment, which assumed office in 1874, did enjoy in its fourth year\r\na fleeting flush of success, which, however, proved illusory. With\r\nthat single exception, every other modern Government that has lasted\r\nso long, has occupied an unsatisfactory position in its fourth year.\r\nThe Government of 1880 in the year 1884 was brought very low, and was\r\ndeeply involved in disastrous enterprises beyond the sea which\r\nultimately resulted in sorrow and misfortune. The Conservative\r\nGovernment which took office in 1886 was by the year 1890, owing to\r\nits strange proceedings against Mr. Parnell, brought to the depths of\r\nhumiliation. The Government of 1895 was in the year 1899 thoroughly\r\nunpopular, and if they had not plunged into the tumult of war in South\r\nAfrica, they would very shortly have been dismissed from power. As for\r\nthe Government of 1900, in the fourth year of Mr. Balfour's late\r\nAdministration, I am sure I could not easily do justice to the\r\nmelancholy position which they occupied.\r\n\r\nWhere do we stand to-day at the end of our fourth year of office? I\r\nput it plainly to you to consider, whether one is not justified in\r\nsaying that we occupy a position of unexampled strength at the present\r\ntime. The Government is strong in its administrative record, which\r\nreveals no single serious or striking mistake in all the complicated\r\nconduct of affairs. There have been no regrettable incidents by land\r\nor sea and none of those personal conflicts between the high officials\r\nthat used to occur so frequently under a late dispensation. We have\r\nhad no waste of public treasure and no bloodshed. We are strong in\r\nthe consciousness of a persistent effort to sweep away anomalies and\r\ninequalities, to redress injustice, to open more widely to the masses\r\nof the people the good chances in life, and to safeguard them against\r\nits evil chances. We also claim that we are strong in the support and\r\nenthusiasm of a majority of our fellow-countrymen. We are strong in\r\nthe triumph of our policy in South Africa; most of all we are strong\r\nin the hopes and plans which we have formed for the future.\r\n\r\nIt is about this future that I will speak to you this afternoon. And\r\nlet me tell you that when I think about it, I do not feel at all\r\ninclined to plead exhaustion in consequence of the exertions we have\r\nmade, or to dwell upon the successes which we have had in the past, or\r\nto survey with complacency the record of the Government or to ask you\r\nto praise us for the work which we have done. No; when I think of the\r\nwork which lies before us, upon which we have already entered, of the\r\nlong avenues of social reconstruction and reorganisation which open\r\nout in so many directions and ever more broadly before us, of the\r\nhideous squalor and misery which darken and poison the life of\r\nBritain, of the need of earnest action, of the prospects of effective\r\nand immediate action--when I dwell upon this, it is not of feelings of\r\nlassitude or exhaustion that I am conscious, but only of a vehement\r\nimpulse to press onwards.\r\n\r\nThe social conditions of the British people in the early years of the\r\ntwentieth century cannot be contemplated without deep anxiety. The\r\nanxiety is keen because it arises out of uncertainty. It is the\r\ngnawing anxiety of suspense. What is the destiny of our country to be?\r\nNothing is settled either for or against us. We have no reason to\r\ndespair; still less have we any reason to be self-satisfied. All is\r\nstill in our hands for good or for ill. We have the power to-day to\r\nchoose our fortune, and I believe there is no nation in the world,\r\nperhaps there never has been in history, any nation which at one and\r\nthe same moment was confronted with such opposite possibilities, was\r\nthreatened on the one hand by more melancholy disaster, and cheered on\r\nthe other by more bright, yet not unreasonable hopes. The two roads\r\nare open. We are at the cross-ways. If we stand on in the old\r\nhappy-go-lucky way, the richer classes ever growing in wealth and in\r\nnumber, and ever declining in responsibility, the very poor remaining\r\nplunged or plunging even deeper into helpless, hopeless misery, then I\r\nthink there is nothing before us but savage strife between class and\r\nclass, with an increasing disorganisation, with an increasing\r\ndestruction of human strength and human virtue--nothing, in fact, but\r\nthat dual degeneration which comes from the simultaneous waste of\r\nextreme wealth and of extreme want.\r\n\r\nNow we have had over here lately colonial editors from all the\r\nColonies of the British Empire, and what is the opinion which they\r\nexpressed as to the worst thing they saw in the old country? The\r\nrepresentatives of every Colony have expressed the opinion that the\r\nworst they saw here, was the extreme of poverty side by side with the\r\nextreme of luxury. Do not you think it is very impressive to find an\r\nopinion like that, expressed in all friendship and sincerity, by men\r\nof our own race who have come from lands which are so widely scattered\r\nover the surface of the earth, and are the product of such varied\r\nconditions? Is it not impressive to find that they are all agreed,\r\ncoming as they do from Australia, or Canada, or South Africa, or New\r\nZealand, that the greatest danger to the British Empire and to the\r\nBritish people is not to be found among the enormous fleets and armies\r\nof the European Continent, nor in the solemn problems of Hindustan; it\r\nis not the Yellow peril nor the Black peril nor any danger in the wide\r\ncircuit of colonial and foreign affairs. No, it is here in our midst,\r\nclose at home, close at hand in the vast growing cities of England and\r\nScotland, and in the dwindling and cramped villages of our denuded\r\ncountryside. It is there you will find the seeds of Imperial ruin and\r\nnational decay--the unnatural gap between rich and poor, the divorce\r\nof the people from the land, the want of proper discipline and\r\ntraining in our youth, the exploitation of boy labour, the physical\r\ndegeneration which seems to follow so swiftly on civilised poverty,\r\nthe awful jumbles of an obsolete Poor Law, the horrid havoc of the\r\nliquor traffic, the constant insecurity in the means of subsistence\r\nand employment which breaks the heart of many a sober, hard-working\r\nman, the absence of any established minimum standard of life and\r\ncomfort among the workers, and, at the other end, the swift increase\r\nof vulgar, joyless luxury--here are the enemies of Britain. Beware\r\nlest they shatter the foundations of her power.\r\n\r\nThen look at the other side, look at the forces for good, the moral\r\nforces, the spiritual forces, the civic, the scientific, the patriotic\r\nforces which make for order and harmony and health and life. Are they\r\nnot tremendous too? Do we not see them everywhere, in every town, in\r\nevery class, in every creed, strong forces worthy of Old England,\r\ncoming to her rescue, fighting for her soul? That is the situation in\r\nour country as I see it this afternoon--two great armies evenly\r\nmatched, locked in fierce conflict with each other all along the line,\r\nswaying backwards and forwards in strife--and for my part I am\r\nconfident that the right will win, that the generous influences will\r\ntriumph over the selfish influences, that the organising forces will\r\ndevour the forces of degeneration, and that the British people will\r\nemerge triumphant from their struggles to clear the road and lead the\r\nmarch amongst the foremost nations of the world.\r\n\r\nWell, now, I want to ask you a question. I daresay there are some of\r\nyou who do not like this or that particular point in the Budget, who\r\ndo not like some particular argument or phrase which some of us may\r\nhave used in advocating or defending it. But it is not of these\r\ndetails that I speak; the question I want each of you to ask himself\r\nis this: On which side of this great battle which I have described to\r\nyou, does the Budget count? Can any of you, looking at it broadly and\r\nas a whole, looking on the policy which surrounds it, and which\r\ndepends upon it, looking at the arguments by which it is defended, as\r\nwell as the arguments by which it is opposed--can any one doubt that\r\nthe Budget in its essential character and meaning, in its spirit and\r\nin its practical effect, would be a tremendous reinforcement, almost\r\nlike a new army coming up at the end of the day, upon the side of all\r\nthose forces and influences which are fighting for the life and health\r\nand progress of our race?\r\n\r\nIn the speeches which I have made about the country since the Budget\r\nwas introduced I have explained and defended in detail the special\r\nfinancial proposals upon which we rely to provide the revenue for the\r\nyear. You are, no doubt, generally acquainted with them. There is the\r\nincrease in the income-tax of twopence, the further discrimination\r\nbetween earned and unearned income, and the super-tax of sixpence on\r\nincomes of over L5,000 a year. There are the increases in estate\r\nduties and in the legacy duties, and there are the new duties on\r\nstamps; there is the tax on motor-cars and petrol, the proceeds of\r\nwhich are to go to the improvement of the roads and the abatement of\r\nthe dust nuisance; there are the taxes on working class\r\nindulgences--namely, the increase in the tax on tobacco and on whisky,\r\nwhich enable the working man to pay his share, as indeed he has shown\r\nhimself very ready to do; there are the taxes on liquor licences,\r\nwhich are designed to secure for the State a certain special\r\nproportion of the monopoly value created wholly by the State and with\r\nwhich it should never have parted; and, lastly, there are the three\r\ntaxes upon the unearned increment in land, upon undeveloped land, upon\r\nthe unearned increment in the reversion of leases, and then there is\r\nthe tax upon mining royalties.\r\n\r\nNow these are the actual proposals of the Budget, and I do not think\r\nthat, if I had the time, I should find any great difficulty in showing\r\nyou that there are many good arguments, a great volume of sound\r\nreason, which can be adduced in support of every one of these\r\nproposals. Certainly there is no difficulty in showing that since the\r\nBudget has been introduced there has been no shock to credit, there\r\nhas been no dislocation of business, there has been no setback in the\r\nbeginning of that trade revival about the approach of which I spoke to\r\nyou, when I was in Leicester at the beginning of the year and which\r\nthere are now good reasons for believing is actually in progress. The\r\ntaxes which have been proposed have not laid any burden upon the\r\nnecessaries of life like bread or meat, nor have they laid any\r\nincreased burden upon comforts like tea and sugar. There is nothing in\r\nthese taxes which makes it harder for a labouring man to keep up his\r\nstrength or for the small man of the middle class to maintain his\r\nstyle of living. There is nothing in these taxes which makes it more\r\ndifficult for any hard-working person, whether he works with his hands\r\nor his head, to keep a home together in decent comfort. No impediment\r\nhas been placed by these taxes upon enterprise; no hampering\r\nrestrictions interrupt the flow of commerce. On the contrary, if the\r\ntax upon spirits should result in a diminution in the consumption of\r\nstrong drink, depend upon it, the State will gain, and all classes\r\nwill gain. The health of millions of people, the happiness of hundreds\r\nof thousands of homes, will be sensibly improved, and money that would\r\nhave been spent upon whisky will flow into other channels, much less\r\nlikely to produce evil and much more likely to produce employment. And\r\nif the tax on undeveloped land, on land, that is to say, which is kept\r\nout of the market, which is held up idly in order that its owner may\r\nreap unearned profit by the exertions and through the needs of the\r\nsurrounding community, if that tax should have the effect of breaking\r\nthis monopoly and of making land cheaper, a tremendous check on every\r\nform of productive activity will have been removed. All sorts of\r\nenterprises will become economically possible which are now impossible\r\nowing to the artificially high price of land, and new forces will be\r\nliberated to stimulate the wealth of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut it is not on these points that I wish to dwell this afternoon. I\r\nwant to tell you about the meaning and the spirit of the Budget. Upon\r\nthe Budget and upon the policy of the Budget depends a far-reaching\r\nplan of social organisation designed to give a greater measure of\r\nsecurity to all classes, but particularly to the labouring classes.\r\nIn the centre of that plan stands the policy of national insurance.\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has been for more than a year at work\r\nupon this scheme, and it is proposed--I hope next year, if there is a\r\nnext year--it is proposed, working through the great friendly\r\nsocieties, which have done so much invaluable work on these lines, to\r\nmake sure that, by the aid of a substantial subvention from the State,\r\neven the poorest steady worker or the poorest family shall be enabled\r\nto make provision against sickness, against invalidity, and for the\r\nwidows and orphans who may be left behind.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this is the scheme of insurance against unemployment\r\nwhich I hope to have the honour of passing through Parliament next\r\nyear. The details of that scheme are practically complete, and it will\r\nenable upwards of two and a quarter millions of workers in the most\r\nuncertain trades of this country--trades like ship-building,\r\nengineering, and building--to secure unemployment benefits, which in a\r\ngreat majority of cases will be sufficient to tide them over the\r\nseason of unemployment. This scheme in its compulsory form is limited\r\nto certain great trades like those I have specified, but it will be\r\nopen to other trades, to trade unions, to workers' associations of\r\nvarious kinds, or even to individuals to insure with the State\r\nUnemployment Insurance Office against unemployment on a voluntary\r\nbasis, and to secure, through the State subvention, much better terms\r\nthan it would be possible for them to obtain at the present time.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to work a scheme of unemployment insurance\r\nexcept in conjunction with some effective method of finding work and\r\nof testing willingness to work, and that can only be afforded by a\r\nnational system of labour exchanges. That Bill has already passed\r\nthrough Parliament, and in the early months of next year we shall hope\r\nto bring it into operation by opening, all over the country, a network\r\nof labour exchanges connected with each other and with the centre by\r\ntelephone. We believe this organisation may secure for labour--and,\r\nafter all, labour is the only thing the great majority of people have\r\nto sell--it will secure for labour, for the first time, that free and\r\nfair market which almost all other commodities of infinitely less\r\nconsequence already enjoy, and will replace the present wasteful,\r\nheartbreaking wanderings aimlessly to and fro in search of work by a\r\nscientific system; and we believe that the influence of this system in\r\nthe end must tend to standardising the conditions of wages and\r\nemployment throughout the country.\r\n\r\nLastly, in connection with unemployment I must direct your attention\r\nto the Development Bill, which is now before Parliament, the object of\r\nwhich is to provide a fund for the economic development of our\r\ncountry, for the encouragement of agriculture, for afforestation, for\r\nthe colonisation of England, and for the making of roads, harbours,\r\nand other public works. And I should like to draw your attention to a\r\nvery important clause in that Bill, which says that the prosecution of\r\nthese works shall be regulated, as far as possible, by the conditions\r\nof the labour market, so that in a very bad year of unemployment they\r\ncan be expanded, so as to increase the demand for labour at times of\r\nexceptional slackness, and thus correct and counterbalance the cruel\r\nfluctuations of the labour market. The large sums of money which will\r\nbe needed for these purposes are being provided by the Budget of Mr.\r\nLloyd-George, and will be provided in an expanding volume in the\r\nyears to come through the natural growth of the taxes we are imposing.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto been speaking of the industrial organisation of\r\ninsurance schemes, labour exchanges, and economic development. Now I\r\ncome to that great group of questions which are concerned with the\r\nprevention and relief of distress. We have before us the reports of\r\nthe majority and minority of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law, and\r\nwe see there a great and urgent body of reforms which require the\r\nattention of Parliament. The first and most costly step in the relief\r\nof distress has already been taken by the Old-Age Pensions Act,\r\nsupplemented, as it will be if the Budget passes, by the removal of\r\nthe pauper disqualification. By that Act we have rescued the aged from\r\nthe Poor Law. We have yet to rescue the children; we have yet to\r\ndistinguish effectively between the _bona fide_ unemployed workman and\r\nthe mere loafer and vagrant; we have yet to transfer the sick, the\r\ninebriate, the feeble-minded and the totally demoralised to\r\nauthorities specially concerned in their management and care.\r\n\r\nBut what I want to show you, if I have made my argument clear, is that\r\nall these schemes--which I can do little more than mention this\r\nafternoon, each one of which is important--are connected one with the\r\nother, fit into one another at many points, that they are part of a\r\nconcerted and interdependent system for giving a better, fairer social\r\norganisation to the masses of our fellow-countrymen. Unemployment\r\ninsurance, which will help to tide a workman over a bad period, is\r\nintimately and necessarily associated with the labour exchanges which\r\nwill help to find him work and which will test his willingness to\r\nwork. This, again, will be affected by the workings of the Development\r\nBill, which, as I told you, we trust may act as a counterpoise to the\r\nrocking of the industrial boat and give a greater measure of stability\r\nto the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe fact that everybody in the country, man and woman alike, will be\r\nentitled, with scarcely any exception, to an old-age pension from the\r\nState at the age of seventy--that fact makes it ever so much cheaper\r\nto insure against invalidity or infirmity up to the age of seventy.\r\nAnd, with the various insurance schemes which are in preparation, we\r\nought to be able to set up a complete ladder, an unbroken bridge or\r\ncauseway, as it were, along which the whole body of the people may\r\nmove with a certain assured measure of security and safety against\r\nhazards and misfortunes. Then, if provision can be arranged for widows\r\nand orphans who are left behind, that will be a powerful remedy\r\nagainst the sweating evil; for, as you know, these helpless people,\r\nwho in every country find employment in particular trades, are unable\r\nto make any fair bargain for themselves, and their labour, and this\r\nconsequently leads to the great evils which have very often been\r\nbrought to the notice of Parliament. That, again, will fit in with the\r\nAnti-Sweating Bill we are passing through Parliament this year.\r\n\r\nNow, I want you to see what a large, coherent plan we are trying to\r\nwork out, and I want you to believe that the object of the plan and\r\nthe results of it will be to make us a stronger as well as a happier\r\nnation. I was reading the other day some of the speeches made by\r\nBismarck--a man who, perhaps more than any other, built up in his own\r\nlifetime the strength of a great nation--speeches which he made during\r\nthe time when he was introducing into Germany those vast insurance\r\nschemes, now deemed by all classes and parties in Germany to be of\r\nthe utmost consequence and value. \"I should like to see the State\"\r\n(said Prince Bismarck in 1881), \"which for the most part consists of\r\nChristians, penetrated to some extent by the principles of the\r\nreligion which it professes, especially as concerns the help one gives\r\nto his neighbour, and sympathy with the lot of old and suffering\r\npeople.\" Then, again, in the year 1884 he said: \"The whole matter\r\ncentres in the question, 'Is it the duty of the State or is it not to\r\nprovide for its helpless citizens?' I maintain that it is its duty,\r\nthat it is the duty, not only of the 'Christian' State, as I ventured\r\nonce to call it when speaking of 'Practical Christianity,' but of\r\nevery State.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a great many people who will tell you that such a policy, as\r\nI have been endeavouring to outline to you this afternoon, will not\r\nmake our country stronger, because it will sap the self-reliance of\r\nthe working classes. It is very easy for rich people to preach the\r\nvirtues of self-reliance to the poor. It is also very foolish,\r\nbecause, as a matter of fact, the wealthy, so far from being\r\nself-reliant, are dependent on the constant attention of scores, and\r\nsometimes even hundreds, of persons who are employed in waiting upon\r\nthem and ministering to their wants. I think you will agree with me,\r\non the other hand--knowing what you do of the life of this city and of\r\nthe working classes generally--that there are often trials and\r\nmisfortunes which come upon working-class families quite beyond any\r\nprovision which their utmost unaided industry and courage could secure\r\nfor them. Left to themselves, left absolutely to themselves, they must\r\nbe smashed to pieces, if any exceptional disaster or accident, like\r\nrecurring sickness, like the death or incapacity of the breadwinner,\r\nor prolonged or protracted unemployment, fall upon them.\r\n\r\nThere is no chance of making people self-reliant by confronting them\r\nwith problems and with trials beyond their capacity to surmount. You\r\ndo not make a man self-reliant by crushing him under a steam roller.\r\nNothing in our plans will relieve people from the need of making every\r\nexertion to help themselves, but, on the contrary, we consider that we\r\nshall greatly stimulate their efforts by giving them for the first\r\ntime a practical assurance that those efforts will be crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI have now tried to show you that the Budget, and the policy of the\r\nBudget, is the first conscious attempt on the part of the State to\r\nbuild up a better and a more scientific organisation of society for\r\nthe workers of this country, and it will be for you to say--at no very\r\ndistant date--whether all this effort for a coherent scheme of social\r\nreconstruction is to be swept away into the region of lost endeavour.\r\n\r\nThat is the main aspect of the Budget to which I wish to draw your\r\nattention. But there is another significance of the highest importance\r\nwhich attaches to the Budget. I mean the new attitude of the State\r\ntowards wealth. Formerly the only question of the tax-gatherer was,\r\n\"How much have you got?\" We ask that question still, and there is a\r\ngeneral feeling, recognised as just by all parties, that the rate of\r\ntaxation should be greater for large incomes than for small. As to how\r\nmuch greater, parties are no doubt in dispute. But now a new question\r\nhas arisen. We do not only ask to-day, \"How much have you got?\" we\r\nalso ask, \"How did you get it? Did you earn it by yourself, or has it\r\njust been left you by others? Was it gained by processes which are in\r\nthemselves beneficial to the community in general, or was it gained by\r\nprocesses which have done no good to any one, but only harm? Was it\r\ngained by the enterprise and capacity necessary to found a business,\r\nor merely by squeezing and bleeding the owner and founder of the\r\nbusiness? Was it gained by supplying the capital which industry needs,\r\nor by denying, except at an extortionate price, the land which\r\nindustry requires? Was it derived from active reproductive processes,\r\nor merely by squatting on some piece of necessary land till enterprise\r\nand labour, and national interests and municipal interests, had to buy\r\nyou out at fifty times the agricultural value? Was it gained from\r\nopening new minerals to the service of man, or by drawing a mining\r\nroyalty from the toil and adventure of others? Was it gained by the\r\ncurious process of using political influence to convert an annual\r\nlicence into a practical freehold and thereby pocketing a monopoly\r\nvalue which properly belongs to the State--how did you get it?\" That\r\nis the new question which has been postulated and which is vibrating\r\nin penetrating repetition through the land.[20]\r\n\r\nIt is a tremendous question, never previously in this country asked so\r\nplainly, a new idea, pregnant, formidable, full of life, that taxation\r\nshould not only have regard to the volume of wealth, but, so far as\r\npossible, to the character of the processes of its origin. I do not\r\nwonder it has raised a great stir. I do not wonder that there are\r\nheart-searchings and angry words because that simple question, that\r\nmodest proposal, which we see embodied in the new income-tax\r\nprovisions, in the land taxes, in the licence duties, and in the tax\r\non mining royalties--that modest proposal means, and can only mean,\r\nthe refusal of the modern State to bow down unquestioningly before the\r\nauthority of wealth. This refusal to treat all forms of wealth with\r\nequal deference, no matter what may have been the process by which it\r\nwas acquired, is a strenuous assertion in a practical form, that there\r\nought to be a constant relation between acquired wealth and useful\r\nservice previously rendered, and that where no service, but rather\r\ndisservice, is proved, then, whenever possible, the State should make\r\na sensible difference in the taxes it is bound to impose.\r\n\r\nIt is well that you should keep these issues clearly before you\r\nduring the weeks in which we seem to be marching towards a grave\r\nconstitutional crisis. But I should like to tell you that a general\r\nelection, consequent upon the rejection of the Budget by the Lords,\r\nwould not, ought not to be, and could not be fought upon the Budget\r\nalone. \"Budgets come,\" as the late Lord Salisbury said in\r\n1894--\"Budgets come and Budgets go.\" Every Government frames its own\r\nexpenditure for each year; every Government has to make its own\r\nprovision to meet that expenditure. There is a Budget every year, and\r\nmemorable as the Budget of my right hon. friend may be, far-reaching\r\nas is the policy depending upon it, the Finance Bill, after all, is in\r\nits character only an annual affair. But the rejection of the Budget\r\nby the House of Lords would not be an annual affair. It would be a\r\nviolent rupture of constitutional custom and usage extending over\r\nthree hundred years and recognised during all that time by the leaders\r\nof every Party in the State. It would involve a sharp and sensible\r\nbreach with the traditions of the past; and what does the House of\r\nLords depend upon if not upon the traditions of the past? It would\r\namount to an attempt at revolution not by the poor, but by the rich;\r\nnot by the masses, but by the privileged few; not in the name of\r\nprogress, but in that of reaction; not for the purpose of broadening\r\nthe framework of the State, but of greatly narrowing it. Such an\r\nattempt, whatever you may think of it, would be historic in its\r\ncharacter, and the result of the battle fought upon it, whoever wins,\r\nmust inevitably be not of an annual, but of a permanent and final\r\ncharacter. The result of such an election must mean an alteration of\r\nthe veto of the House of Lords; if they win they will have asserted\r\ntheir right, not merely to reject legislation of the House of Commons,\r\nbut to control the finances of the country, and if they lose, we will\r\ndeal with their veto once and for all.\r\n\r\nWe do not seek the struggle, we have our work to do; but if it is to\r\ncome, it could never come better than now. Never again perhaps,\r\ncertainly not for many years, will such an opportunity be presented to\r\nthe British democracy. Never will the ground be more favourable; never\r\nwill the issues be more clearly or more vividly defined. Those issues\r\nwill be whether the new taxation, which is admitted on all sides to be\r\nnecessary, shall be imposed upon luxuries, superfluities, and\r\nmonopolies, or upon the prime necessaries of life; whether you shall\r\nput your tax upon the unearned increment on land or upon the daily\r\nbread of labour; whether the policy of constructive social reform on\r\nwhich we are embarked, and which expands and deepens as we advance,\r\nshall be carried through and given a fair chance, or whether it shall\r\nbe brought to a dead stop and all the energies and attention of the\r\nState devoted to Jingo armaments and senseless foreign adventure. And,\r\nlastly, the issue will be whether the British people in the year of\r\ngrace 1909 are going to be ruled through a representative Assembly,\r\nelected by six or seven millions of voters, about which almost every\r\none in the country, man or woman, has a chance of being consulted, or\r\nwhether they are going to allow themselves to be dictated to and\r\ndomineered over by a minute minority of titled persons, who represent\r\nnobody, who are answerable to nobody, and who only scurry up to London\r\nto vote in their party interests, in their class interests, and in\r\ntheir own interests.\r\n\r\nThese will be the issues, and I am content that the responsibility for\r\nsuch a struggle, if it should come, should rest with the House of\r\nLords themselves. But if it is to come, we shall not complain, we\r\nshall not draw back from it. We will engage in it with all our hearts\r\nand with all our might, it being always clearly understood that the\r\nfight will be a fight to the finish, and that the fullest forfeits,\r\nwhich are in accordance with the national welfare, shall be exacted\r\nfrom the defeated foe.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] We do not, of course, ask it of the individual taxpayer. That\r\nwould be an impossible inquisition. But the House of Commons asks\r\nitself when it has to choose between taxes on various forms of wealth,\r\n\"By what process was it got?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET AND PROPERTY.\r\n\r\nABERNETHY, _October 7, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Daily Telegraph_, by permission of the Editor.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a very fine gathering for a lonely glen, and it augurs well\r\nfor the spirit of Liberalism. Much will be expected of Scotland in the\r\nnear future. She will be invited to pronounce upon some of the largest\r\nand most complicated questions of politics and finance that can\r\npossibly engage the attention of thoughtful citizens, and her decision\r\nwill perhaps govern events.\r\n\r\nThere is one contrast between Parties which springs to the eye at\r\nonce. One Party has a policy, detailed, definite, declared, actually\r\nin being. The other Party has no policy. The Conservative Party has no\r\npolicy which it can put before the country at the present time on any\r\nof the great controverted questions of the day. On most of the\r\nprevious occasions when we have approached a great trial of strength,\r\nthe Conservative Party have had a policy of their own which they\r\ncould state in clear terms. You would naturally expect some reticence\r\nor reserve from the head of a Government responsible for the\r\nday-to-day administration of affairs. But what do you see at the\r\npresent time? Mr. Asquith speaks out boldly and plainly on all the\r\ngreat questions which are being debated, and it is the Leader of the\r\nOpposition who has to take refuge in a tactical and evasive attitude.\r\nWhy, Mr. Balfour is unable to answer the simplest questions. At\r\nBirmingham, the Prime Minister asked him in so many words: What\r\nalternative did he propose to the Budget? What did he mean by Tariff\r\nReform? and what was his counsel to the House of Lords?\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to frame an answer to all these questions.\r\nMr. Chamberlain, for instance, was quite ready with his answers to all\r\nof them. At Glasgow in 1903 he stated what his Budget would have been,\r\nand he explained precisely what he meant by Tariff Reform. At\r\nBirmingham last month he was equally clear in urging the Lords to\r\nreject the Budget. There is no doubt whatever where Mr. Chamberlain\r\nand those who agree with him stand to-day. They would raise the extra\r\ntaxation which is required, by protective import duties on bread, on\r\nmeat, on butter, cheese, and eggs, and upon foreign imported\r\nmanufactured articles; and in order to substitute their plan for ours\r\nthey are prepared to urge the House of Lords to smash up the Budget\r\nand to smash up as much of the British Constitution and the British\r\nfinancial system as may be necessary for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThat is their policy; but, after all, it is Mr. Balfour who is the\r\nleader of the Conservative Party. He is the statesman who would have\r\nto form and carry on any administration which might be formed from\r\nthat Party, and he will not state his policy upon any of the dominant\r\nquestions of the day. Why will he not answer these simple questions?\r\nHe is the leader, and it is because he wishes to remain the leader\r\nthat he observes this discreet silence. He tells us he is in favour of\r\nTariff Reform, he loves Tariff Reform, he worships Tariff Reform. He\r\nfeels that it is by Tariff Reform alone that the civilisation of Great\r\nBritain can be secured, and the unity of the Empire achieved; but\r\nnothing will induce him to say what he means by Tariff Reform. That is\r\na secret which remains locked in his own breast. He condemns our\r\nBudget, he clamours for greater expenditure, and yet he puts forward\r\nno alternative proposals by which the void in the public finances may\r\nbe made good. And as for his opinion about the House of Lords, he dare\r\nnot state his true opinion to-day upon that subject. I do not say that\r\nthere are not good reasons for Mr. Balfour's caution. It sometimes\r\nhappens that the politics of a Party become involved in such a queer\r\nand awkward tangle that only a choice of evils is at the disposal of\r\nits leader; and when the leader has to choose between sliding into a\r\nbog on the one hand and jumping over a precipice on the other, some\r\nmeasure of indulgence may be extended to him if he prefers to go on\r\nmarking time, and indicating the direction in which his followers are\r\nto advance by a vague general gesture towards the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nWhatever you may think about politics, you must at least, in justice\r\nto his Majesty's Government, recognise that their position is\r\nperfectly plain and clear. Some of you may say to me, \"Your course,\r\nyour policy may be clear enough, but you are burdening wealth too\r\nheavily by your taxes and by your speeches.\" Those shocking speeches!\r\n\"You are driving capital out of the country.\" Let us look at these\r\npoints one at a time. The capital wealth of Britain is increasing\r\nrapidly. Sir Robert Giffen estimated some years ago that the addition\r\nto the capital wealth of the nation was at least between two hundred\r\nand three hundred millions a year. I notice that the paid-up capital\r\nof registered companies alone, which was 1,013 millions sterling in\r\n1893, has grown naturally and healthily to 2,123 millions sterling in\r\n1908. And, most remarkable of all, the figures I shall submit to you,\r\nthe gross amount of income which comes under the view of the Treasury\r\nCommissioners who are charged with the collection of income-tax, was\r\nin the year 1898-9 762 millions, and it had risen from that figure to\r\n980 millions sterling in the year 1908-9: that is to say, that it had\r\nrisen by 218 millions in the course of ten years.\r\n\r\nFrom this, of course, a deduction has to be made for more efficient\r\nmethods of collection. This cannot be estimated exactly; but it\r\ncertainly accounts for much less than half the increase. Let us assume\r\nthat it is a half. The increase is therefore 109 millions. I only wish\r\nthat wages had increased in the same proportion. When I was studying\r\nthose figures I have mentioned to you I looked at the Board of Trade\r\nreturns of wages. Those returns deal with the affairs of upwards of\r\nten millions of persons, and in the last ten years the increase in the\r\nannual wages of that great body of persons has only been about ten\r\nmillion pounds: that is to say, that the increase of income assessable\r\nto income-tax is at the very least more than ten times greater than\r\nthe increase which has taken place in the same period in the wages of\r\nthose trades which come within the Board of Trade returns.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the question of how burdens are to be distributed, you\r\nmust bear these facts and figures in mind, because the choice is\r\nseverely limited. You can tax wealth or you can tax wages--that is the\r\nwhole choice which is at the disposal of the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. Of course I know there are some people who say you can tax\r\nthe foreigner--but I am quite sure that you will not expect me to\r\nwaste your time in dealing with that gospel of quacks and creed of\r\ngulls. The choice is between wealth and wages, and we think that, in\r\nview of that great increase in accumulated wealth which has marked\r\nthe last ten years, and is the feature of our modern life, it is not\r\nexcessive or unreasonable at the present stage in our national\r\nfinances to ask for a further contribution from the direct taxpayers\r\nof something under eight millions a year. That is the total of all the\r\nnew taxes on wealth which our Budget imposes, and it is about equal to\r\nthe cost of four of those _Dreadnoughts_ for which these same classes\r\nwere clamouring a few months ago. And it is less than one-thirteenth\r\nof the increased income assessable to income-tax in the last ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is because we have done this that we are the object of all this\r\nabuse and indignation which is so loudly expressed in certain quarters\r\nthroughout the country at the present time. While the working-classes\r\nhave borne the extra taxation upon their tobacco and whisky in\r\nsilence, all this rage and fury is outpoured upon the Government by\r\nthe owners of this ever-increasing fund of wealth, and we are\r\ndenounced as Socialists, as Jacobins, as Anarchists, as Communists,\r\nand all the rest of the half-understood vocabulary of irritated\r\nignorance, for having dared to go to the wealthy classes for a fair\r\nshare of the necessary burdens of the country. How easy it would be\r\nfor us to escape from all this abuse if we were to put the extra\r\ntaxation entirely upon the wages of the working classes by means of\r\ntaxes on bread and on meat. In a moment the scene would change, and we\r\nshould be hailed as patriotic, far-sighted Empire-builders, loyal and\r\nnoble-hearted citizens worthy of the Motherland, and sagacious\r\nstatesmen versed in the science of government. See, now, upon what\r\ninsecure and doubtful foundations human praise and human censure\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nWell, then, it is said your taxes fall too heavily upon the\r\nagricultural landowner and the country gentleman. Now, there is no\r\ngrosser misrepresentation of the Budget than that it hits the\r\nagricultural landowner, and I think few greater disservices can be\r\ndone to the agricultural landowner, whose property has in the last\r\nthirty years in many cases declined in value, than to confuse him with\r\nthe ground landlord in a great city, who has netted enormous sums\r\nthrough the growth and the needs of the population of the city. None\r\nof the new land taxes touch agricultural land, while it remains\r\nagricultural land. No cost of the system of valuation which we are\r\ngoing to carry into effect will fall at all upon the individual owner\r\nof landed property. He will not be burdened in any way by these\r\nproposals. On the contrary, now that an amendment has been accepted\r\npermitting death duties to be paid in land in certain circumstances,\r\nthe owner of a landed estate, instead of encumbering his estate by\r\nraising the money to pay off the death duties, can cut a portion from\r\nhis estate; and this in many cases will be a sensible relief.\r\nSecondly, we have given to agricultural landowners a substantial\r\nconcession in regard to the deductions which they are permitted to\r\nmake from income-tax assessment on account of the money which they\r\nspend as good landlords upon the upkeep of their properties, and we\r\nhave raised the limit of deduction from 121/2 per cent. to 25 per cent.\r\nThirdly, there is the Development Bill--that flagrant Socialistic\r\nmeasure which passed a second reading in the House of Lords\r\nunanimously--which will help all the countryside and all classes of\r\nagriculturists, and which will help the landlord in the country among\r\nthe rest. So much for that charge.\r\n\r\nThen it is said, \"At any rate you cannot deny that the Budget is\r\ndriving capital out of the country.\" I should like to point out to you\r\nthat before the Budget was introduced, we were told that it was Free\r\nTrade that was driving capital out of the country. Let that pass. It\r\nis said we cannot deny that the Budget is driving capital out of the\r\ncountry. I deny it absolutely. To begin with, it is impossible to\r\ndrive the greater part of our capital out of this country, for what is\r\nthe capital of the country? The greatest part of that capital is the\r\nland, the state of cultivation which exists, the roads, the railways,\r\nthe mines, the mills--this is the greatest part of the capital. The\r\nowners of that capital might conceivably, if they thought fit, depart\r\nfrom the country, but their possessions would remain behind.\r\n\r\nI shall be asked, What about all this foreign investment that is going\r\non? Is not British credit now being diverted abroad to foreign\r\ncountries, to the detriment of our own country? Is not British capital\r\nfleeing from The Socialistic speeches of the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and the President of the Board of Trade, and taking refuge\r\nin Germany, where of course there are no Socialists, or in other\r\ncountries, where there is never any disturbance, like France, or\r\nSpain, or Russia, or Turkey? Now let us look into that. There are only\r\ntwo ways in which capital can leave this country for foreign\r\ninvestments. It is no good sending bits of paper to the foreigner and\r\nexpecting him to pay a dividend in return. There are only two\r\nways--one is by exports made by British labour, and the other by\r\nbullion. Now, if the exports were to increase, surely that should be a\r\ncause of rejoicing, especially to our Tariff Reformers, who regard the\r\nincrease in exports as the index of national prosperity. As for the\r\nsecond--the export of bullion--would you believe it, it is only a\r\ncoincidence, but it is an amusing coincidence, there are actually six\r\nmillion pounds' worth more gold in the country now, than there were at\r\nthe beginning of the year before the Budget was introduced. The active\r\nand profitable investment abroad which has marked the last two or\r\nthree years, which is bound to swell the exports of the next few\r\nyears, has not been attended by any starvation of home industry. On\r\nthe contrary, the amount of money forthcoming for the development of\r\nnew industries and now enterprises in this country during the last\r\ntwo or three years has compared very favourably with the years which\r\nimmediately preceded them, when the Conservative Government was in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nProperty in Great Britain is secure. It would be a great mistake to\r\nsuppose that that security depends upon the House of Lords. If the\r\nsecurity of property in a powerful nation like our own were dependent\r\nupon the action or inaction of 500 or 600 persons, that security would\r\nlong ago have been swept away. The security of property depends upon\r\nits wide diffusion among great numbers and all classes of the\r\npopulation, and it becomes more secure year by year because it is\r\ngradually being more widely distributed. The vital processes of\r\ncivilisation require, and the combined interests of millions\r\nguarantee, the security of property. A society in which property was\r\ninsecure would speedily degenerate into barbarism; a society in which\r\nproperty was absolutely secure, irrespective of all conceptions of\r\njustice in regard to the manner of its acquisition, would degenerate,\r\nnot to barbarism, but death. No one claims that a Government should\r\nfrom time to time, according to its conceptions of justice, attempt\r\nfundamentally to recast the bases on which property is erected. The\r\nprocess must be a gradual one; must be a social and a moral process,\r\nworking steadily in the mind and in the body of the community; but we\r\ncontend, when new burdens have to be apportioned, when new revenues\r\nhave to be procured, when the necessary upkeep of the State requires\r\nfurther taxes to be imposed--we contend that, in distributing the new\r\nburdens, a Government should have regard first of all to ability to\r\npay and, secondly, that they should have regard to some extent, and so\r\nfar as is practicable, to the means and the process by which different\r\nforms of wealth have been acquired; and that they should make a\r\nsensible difference between wealth which is the fruit of productive\r\nenterprise and industry or of individual skill, and wealth which\r\nrepresents the capture by individuals of socially created values. We\r\nsay that ought to be taken into consideration. We are taking it into\r\nconsideration now by the difference we have made in the income-tax\r\nbetween earned and unearned incomes, by the difference we make between\r\nthe taxation which is imposed upon a fortune which a man makes himself\r\nand the fortune which he obtains from a relative or a stranger. We\r\nare taking it into consideration in our tax on mining royalties, in\r\nour licence duties and in our taxes on the unearned increment in land.\r\nThe State, we contend, has a special claim upon the monopoly value of\r\nthe liquor licence, which the State itself has created, and which the\r\nState itself maintains from year to year by its sole authority. If\r\nthat claim has not previously been made good, that is only because the\r\nliquor interest have had the power, by using one branch of the\r\nLegislature, to keep the nation out of its rights. All the more reason\r\nto make our claim good now.\r\n\r\nAgain we say that the unearned increment in land is reaped in\r\nproportion to the disservice done to the community, is a mere toll\r\nlevied upon the community, is an actual burden and imposition upon\r\nthem, and an appropriation by an individual, under existing law, no\r\ndoubt, of socially created wealth. For the principle of a special\r\ncharge being levied on this class of wealth we can cite economic\r\nauthority as high us Adam Smith, and political authority as\r\nrespectable as Lord Rosebery; and for its application we need not\r\nmerely cite authority, but we can point to the successful practice of\r\ngreat civilised neighbouring States.\r\n\r\nIs it really the contention of the Conservative Party that the State\r\nis bound to view all processes of wealth-getting with an equal eye,\r\nprovided they do not come under the criminal codes? Is that their\r\ncontention? Are we really to be bound to impose the same burden upon\r\nthe hardly won income of the professional man and the extraordinary\r\nprofits of the land monopolist? Are we really to recognise the liquor\r\nlicence which the State created, which the law says is for one year\r\nonly--as if it were as much the brewers' or the publicans' property\r\n_for ever_ as the coat on his back? No; it is absurd. Of the waste and\r\nsorrow and ruin which are caused by the liquor traffic, of the injury\r\nto national health and national wealth which follows from it, which\r\nattends its ill-omened footsteps, I say nothing more in my argument\r\nthis afternoon. The State is entitled to reclaim its own, and they\r\nshall at least render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's.\r\n\r\nThe money must be found, and we hold that Parliament, in imposing the\r\ninevitable taxes, is entitled not only to lay a heavier proportionate\r\nburden upon the rich than on the poor, but also to lay a special\r\nburden upon certain forms of wealth which are clearly social in their\r\norigin, and have not at any point been derived from a useful or\r\nproductive process on the part of their possessors. But it may be\r\nsaid, \"Your plans include other expenditure besides the Navy and\r\nOld-age Pensions. What about Insurance, Labour Exchanges, and economic\r\ndevelopment?\" Those objects, at least, it may be urged are not\r\ninevitable or indispensable. It is quite true that the taxation which\r\nwe seek to impose this year, and which is sufficient, and only\r\nsufficient for the needs of this year, will yield more abundant\r\nrevenues in future years, and if at the same time a reduction in the\r\nexpenditure on armaments becomes possible, we shall have substantial\r\nrevenues at our disposal. That is perfectly true, but is that a reason\r\nfor condemning the Budget? When we see on every hand great nations\r\nwhich cannot pay their way, which have to borrow merely to carry on\r\nfrom year to year, when we see how sterile and unproductive all the\r\ndodges and devices of their protective tariffs have become, when we\r\nremember how often we have ourselves been told that under Free Trade\r\nno more revenue could be got, is it not a welcome change for our\r\ncountry, and for our Free Trade policy, to find our opponents\r\ncomplaining of the expansive nature of a Free Trade revenue? I don't\r\nwonder that Tory Protectionists have passed a resolution at Birmingham\r\ndeclaring that the Budget will indefinitely postpone--that was the\r\nphrase--the scheme of Tariff Reform.\r\n\r\nAnd upon what objects and policies do we propose to spend the extra\r\nrevenue which this Budget will unquestionably yield in future years?\r\nPeople talk vaguely of the stability of society, of the strength of\r\nthe Empire, of the permanence of a Christian civilisation. On what\r\nfoundation do they seek to build? There is only one foundation--a\r\nhealthy family life for all. If large classes of the population live\r\nunder conditions which make it difficult if not impossible for them to\r\nkeep a home together in decent comfort, if the children are habitually\r\nunderfed, if the housewife is habitually over-strained, if the\r\nbread-winner is under-employed or under-paid, if all are unprotected\r\nand uninsured against the common hazards of modern industrial life, if\r\nsickness, accident, infirmity, or old age, or unchecked intemperance,\r\nor any other curse or affliction, break up the home, as they break up\r\nthousands of homes, and scatter the family, as they scatter thousands\r\nof families in our land, it is not merely the waste of earning-power\r\nor the dispersal of a few poor sticks of furniture, it is the stamina,\r\nthe virtue, safety, and honour of the British race that are being\r\nsquandered.\r\n\r\nNow the object of every single constructive proposal to which the\r\nrevenues raised by this Budget will be devoted, not less than the\r\nobject of the distribution of the taxes which make up the Budget, is\r\nto buttress and fortify the homes of the people. That is our aim; to\r\nthat task we have bent our backs; and in that labour we shall not be\r\ndaunted by the machine-made abuse of partisans or by the nervous\r\nclamour of selfish riches. Whatever power may be given to us shall be\r\nused for this object. It is for you to say whether power will be given\r\nus to prevail.\r\n\r\nBut they say, \"This uncertainty about the Budget is causing\r\nunemployment; you are aggravating the evils you seek to remedy.\" The\r\nBudget has not increased unemployment. Unemployment is severe in the\r\ncountry this year, but it is less severe this year than it was last,\r\nand it is less severe since the Budget was introduced than before it\r\nwas introduced. The proportion of trade unionists reported to be\r\nunemployed in the Board of Trade returns at the end of September was\r\n7.4 per cent., and that is lower than any month since May 1908, and it\r\ncompares very favourably with September of last year, when the\r\nproportion was not 7.4, but 9.3 per cent.\r\n\r\nI can well believe that the uncertainty as to whether the House of\r\nLords will, in a desperate attempt to escape their fair share of\r\npublic burdens, plunge the country into revolution and its finances\r\ninto chaos--I can well believe that that uncertainty is bad for trade\r\nand employment, and is hampering the revival which is beginning all\r\nover the country. I do not doubt that all this talk of the rejection\r\nof the Budget is injurious to business, to credit, and to enterprise;\r\nbut who is to blame for that? When did we ever hear of a Budget being\r\nrejected by the Lords before? When did we ever hear of a leader of the\r\nHouse of Lords proposing, like Lord Lansdowne, to decide whether he\r\nwould tear up the British Constitution after consultation with the\r\nleaders of the drink trade? The uncertainty is not due to our action,\r\nbut to their threats. Our action has been regular, constitutional,\r\nand necessary. Their threats are violent, unprecedented, and\r\noutrageous. Let them cease their threats. Let one of their\r\nleaders--let Mr. Balfour, for instance, say this year what he said\r\nlast year, in the month of October, at Dumfries. Let him say, \"It is\r\nthe House of Commons and not the House of Lords which settles\r\nuncontrolled our financial system.\" Let him repeat these words, and\r\nall uncertainty about the Budget will be over.\r\n\r\nI am amazed and I am amused when I read in the newspapers the silly\r\nand fantastic rumours which obtain credence, or at any rate currency,\r\nfrom day to day. One day we are told that it is the intention of the\r\nGovernment to seek a dissolution of Parliament before the Budget\r\nreaches the House of Lords--in other words, to kill the child to save\r\nits life. The next day we are told the Government have decided to have\r\na referendum--that is to say, they will ask everybody in the country\r\nto send them a postcard to say whether they would like the Budget to\r\nbecome law or not. Another day we are told that the Government are\r\ncontemplating a bargain with the House of Lords to alter the Budget to\r\nplease them, or that we should make a bargain with them that if they\r\npass the Budget we should seek a dissolution in January. Why should we\r\nmake a bargain with the House of Lords? Every one of those rumours is\r\nmore silly, more idiotic, than the other. I wish our Conservative\r\nfriends would face the facts of the situation. \"Things are what they\r\nare, and their consequences will be what they will be.\" The House of\r\nLords has no scrap of right to interfere in finance. If they do, they\r\nviolate the Constitution, they shatter the finances, and they create\r\nan administrative breakdown the outcome of which no man can foresee.\r\nIf such a situation should occur a Liberal Government can look only to\r\nthe people. We count on you, and we shall come to you. If you sustain\r\nus we shall take effectual steps to prevent such a deadlock ever\r\noccurring again. That is the whole policy of his Majesty's\r\nGovernment--blunt, sober, obvious, and unflinching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL MENACE\r\n\r\nNATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB, _October 9, 1909_\r\n\r\n(From _The Times_, by permission.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have never been able to rank myself among those who believe that the\r\nBudget will be rejected by the House of Lords. It is not that I take\r\nan exaggerated view of the respect which that body would bear to the\r\nconstitutional tradition upon which alone they depend. It is not that\r\nI underrate at all the feelings of personal resentment and of\r\nclass-prejudice with which they regard, naturally, many of the\r\nprovisions of the Budget. But I have a difficulty in believing that\r\nthe responsible statesmen by whom they are led, and by whom we think\r\nthey are controlled, would not hesitate as patriotic men before they\r\nplunged the finances of the country into what would be a largely\r\nirremediable confusion. And still more I find it difficult to believe\r\nthat Party leaders, anxious no doubt for office on the most secure\r\nterms and at the shortest notice, would voluntarily run unusual risks\r\nin order to be able to fight a decisive battle upon exceptionally\r\nunfavourable ground. In common with most of us who are here to-night,\r\nI hold that the rejection of the Budget by the House of Lords would be\r\na constitutional outrage. I do not think we are entitled at this stage\r\nto assume that such an outrage will be committed. We cannot credit\r\nsuch intentions, even though we read them every day brutally and\r\nblatantly affirmed by a powerful Party Press. We do not credit such\r\nintentions. We are, however, bound to be fully prepared against all\r\ncontingencies. The necessary precautions must be taken. The fighting\r\nmachine must undergo all those preliminary processes necessary for a\r\nrapid and efficient mobilisation. And the ground on which a great\r\nbattle might take place, the theatre of war, must be scanned\r\nbeforehand with military foresight. And that is being done.\r\n\r\nBut those who lightly estimate the crisis which will follow the\r\nrejection of the Budget by the House of Lords must be either strangely\r\nunimaginative or else they must be strangely ignorant of British\r\nhistory and of the British Constitution. The control of finance by\r\nthe representative Assembly is the keystone of all that constitutional\r\nfabric upon which and within which all of us here have dwelt safely\r\nand peacefully throughout our lives. It is by the application of the\r\npower of the purse, and by the application of the power of the purse\r\nalmost alone, that we have moved forward, slowly and prosaically, no\r\ndoubt, during the last two hundred years, but without any violent\r\noverturn such as has rent the life and history of almost every other\r\nconsiderable country, from a kind of mediaeval oligarchy to a vast\r\nmodern democratic State based on the suffrages of six million or seven\r\nmillion electors, loyal to the Crown, and clothed with all the stately\r\nforms of the venerable English monarchy. Finance has been the\r\nkeystone. Take finance away from the House of Commons, take the\r\ncomplete control of financial business away from the representative\r\nAssembly, and our whole system of government, be it good, bad, or\r\nindifferent, will crumble to pieces like a house of cards.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of the Budget by the House of Lords would not merely be\r\na question of stopping a money Bill or of knocking out a few taxes\r\nobnoxious to particular classes; the rejection of the Budget by the\r\nHouse of Lords would mean the claim of the House of Lords--that is,\r\nthe claim of a non-elective and unrepresentative Chamber--to make and\r\nto unmake Governments; and a recognition of that claim by the country\r\nwould unquestionably mean that the House of Lords would become the\r\nmain source and origin of all political power under the Crown. Now\r\nthat is a great quarrel; that is a quarrel on which we had hoped, on\r\nwhich we had been taught, that the sword had been sheathed\r\nvictoriously for ever. And that is the issue that is before us now. We\r\ndo not intend to soften it in any way. The responsibility for the\r\nconsequences must rest with the aggressor who first violates the\r\nconstitutional tradition of our land.\r\n\r\nThe Budget is through Committee. We have had not merely an exhaustive\r\nbut an exhausting discussion. I am told by ingenious calculators in\r\nthe newspapers that over six hundred hours, from some of which I\r\nconfess I have been absent, of debate have been accorded to the\r\nCommittee stage. No guillotine closure has been applied. Full, free,\r\nunfettered debate has been accorded--has been accorded with a\r\npatience and with a generosity unprecedented in Parliamentary annals,\r\nand which in effect has left a minority not merely satisfied in all\r\nthe conditions of reasonable debate, but unable even on grounds of the\r\nmost meticulous partisanship to complain that the fullest opportunity\r\nhas not been accorded to them. In all this long process of six hundred\r\nhours and upwards we have shown ourselves willing to make concessions.\r\nThey are boasting to-day that they, forsooth, are in part the authors\r\nof the Budget. Every effort has been made to meet honest and outspoken\r\ndifference; every effort has been made to gather for this Budget--the\r\npeople's Budget, as they know full well it is--the greatest measure of\r\nsupport not only among the labouring classes, but among all classes in\r\nour vast and complicated community.\r\n\r\nIt has been a terrible strain. Lord Rosebery the other day at Glasgow\r\npaid his tribute to the gallant band who had fought in opposition to\r\nthe Budget. Had he no word for his old friends? Had he no word for\r\nthose who were once proud to follow him, and who now use in regard to\r\nhim only the language of regret? Had he no word for that other\r\ngallant band, twice as numerous, often three times as numerous, as the\r\nTory Opposition, who have sat through all these months--fine speakers\r\nsilent through self-suppression for the cause, wealthy men sitting up\r\nto unreasonable hours to pass taxes by which they are mulcted as much\r\nas any Tory? Men who have gone on even at the cost of their lives--had\r\nhe no word for them? We to-night gathered together here in the\r\nNational Liberal Club have a word and a cheer for the private members\r\nof the Liberal Party in the House of Commons who have fought this\r\nbattle through with unequalled loyalty and firmness, and who have\r\nshown a development of Parliamentary power to carry a great measure\r\nwhich I venture to say has no counterpart in the Parliamentary history\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\nWell, that long process of debate, of argument, of concession, of\r\ncompromise, of conciliation will very soon come to an end. When the\r\nBudget leaves the House of Commons the time of discussion, so far as\r\nwe are concerned, will have come to an end. It will leave the House of\r\nCommons in a final form, and no amendment by the House of Lords will\r\nbe entertained by us. I have heard it often said, and I have read it\r\nmore often still, that there are some members of the Cabinet who want\r\nto see the Budget rejected, and I have even been shocked to find\r\nmyself mentioned as one of these Machiavellian intriguers. To those\r\nwho say we want to see the Budget rejected I reply, That is not true.\r\nAs Party men we cannot be blind to the great tactical advantages which\r\nsuch an event would confer upon us. We cannot pretend that our\r\nfeelings in such an event would be feelings of melancholy; but we have\r\nour work to do. Politics is not a game. It is an earnest business. We\r\nhave our work to do. We have large, complex schemes of social\r\norganisation and financial reform on which we have consumed our\r\nefforts, and which we desire to see, at the shortest possible date,\r\nbrought to conception and maturity. We do not want to see the finances\r\nof the country plunged into inextricable confusion, and hideous loss\r\ninflicted on the mass of the people and the taxpayers. For my part, I\r\nsay without hesitation I do not at all wish to see British politics\r\nenter upon a violent, storm-shaken, and revolutionary phase. I am\r\nglad, at any rate, if they are to enter upon that phase, it shall be\r\non the responsibility of others.\r\n\r\nOur intentions are straightforward. We seek no conflict; we fear no\r\nconflict. We shall make no overtures to the House of Lords; we shall\r\naccept no compromise. We are not called upon to offer them any\r\ndignified means of escape from a situation into which they have been\r\nbetrayed by the recklessness of some of their supporters. They have no\r\nright whatever to interfere in financial business directly or\r\nindirectly at any time. That is all we have to say, and for the rest\r\nwe have a powerful organisation, we have a united Party, we have a\r\nresolute Prime Minister, we have a splendid cause.\r\n\r\nI do not think we need at this stage speculate upon the result of a\r\nbattle which has not yet been, and which may never be at this juncture\r\nfought. I have seen enough of the ups and downs of real war to know\r\nhow foolish forecasts of that character often are. But when an army\r\nhas been brought into the field in the best condition, in the largest\r\npossible numbers, in a spirit of the highest enthusiasm, at the most\r\nfavourable season, and on the best possible ground--then I think, when\r\nour army has been brought into that situation, we can afford to await\r\nthe supreme arbitrament with a cool and serene composure; and this\r\nmood of composure and of calmness may ripen into a kind of joyous and\r\nwarlike heartiness, if we can also feel that the cause for which we\r\nare fighting is broadly and grandly a true and righteous cause.\r\n\r\nError, of course, there is always in all human affairs--error of\r\nconception, error of statement, error of manner, error of weakness,\r\nerror of partisanship. We do not deny that, but strip both the great\r\npolitical Parties which to-day present themselves before the people of\r\nBritain, strip them of their error, strip them of that admixture of\r\nerror which cloys and clogs all human action, divest them of the\r\ntrappings of combat in which they are apparelled, let them be nakedly\r\nand faithfully revealed. If that were done, cannot we feel soberly and\r\nassuredly convinced that, on the main contested issues of the day,\r\nupon the need of social organisation, upon the relations between the\r\ntwo Houses of Parliament, upon the regulation and control of the\r\nliquor traffic, upon a national settlement with Ireland as we have\r\nmade with Africa, upon Free Trade, upon the land--upon all of them\r\nseparately, still more upon all of them together, if we ask ourselves\r\nin our most silent and reflective mood alone--cannot we feel a sober\r\nconviction that, on the whole, we hold the larger truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                      |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    | Page 24: bona fide replaced with bona fide                   |\r\n    | Page 285: proverty replaced with property                    |\r\n    | Page 291: beween replaced with between                       |\r\n    | Page 374: 'more than any any' replaced with 'more than any'  |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
